00:00.000 --> 00:02.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

00:04.480 --> 00:08.160
And their advice should never be followed.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.560
Travis insists he's a sexpert.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.000
But if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.800
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only

00:18.800 --> 00:21.040
so the babies out there will know

00:21.040 --> 00:23.540
how cool they are for listening.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.760
What's up, you cool baby?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.280
One, two, three, four.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.280
It's the start of something beautiful.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.520
A small acquaintance has blossomed.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.760
It's ripened into a precious friendship.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.160
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.000
Hangs at the skate park, hangs by the beach.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
My life, it feels like life.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.920
Ah, it's better, it's better with you.

00:58.920 --> 01:04.920
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

01:04.920 --> 01:10.920
This is true, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

01:10.920 --> 01:19.280
My life, ah, it's better with you.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.520
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

01:22.520 --> 01:25.440
and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.520
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.520
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:37.520 --> 01:52.520
And I'm secret agent Damien Ice.

01:52.520 --> 01:57.520
I'm secret agent Damien Ice Blade.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.520
It's Griffin's first time wearing a tuxedo.

01:59.520 --> 02:13.520
Who, who the fuck is Griffin?

02:13.520 --> 02:16.520
I'm Damien Ice Blade, secret agent,

02:16.520 --> 02:18.520
government agent for the spy one.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.520
Oh, wait, Ice Blade of the Nantucket Ice Blades?

02:21.520 --> 02:23.520
Yes.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.520
I heard you were fired in disgrace

02:25.520 --> 02:27.520
for playing by your own rules.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.520
But they needed me when the terrorists did a,

02:31.520 --> 02:34.520
did the, did a disease bomb.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.520
Good luck picking something that isn't happening

02:36.520 --> 02:39.520
in the real world now.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.520
It's a, it's a small.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.520
It's a narrow window.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.520
Small sliver.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.520
And who knows when this will air.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Yeah, right.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.520
By the time this episode goes out, no matter what you say.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.520
They knew about the Jell-O disaster.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
How could they joke about it?

02:52.520 --> 02:53.520
Bring them in.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.520
Bring them in.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.520
They knew too much already.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.520
I hate this.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.520
You hate what?

03:00.520 --> 03:02.520
You hate being fancy and dressed up?

03:02.520 --> 03:06.520
I miss my tuxedo t-shirt for so many reasons.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.520
The first of which being that it breathes

03:10.520 --> 03:14.520
quite a bit better than my current attire.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.520
Okay.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.520
Okay, but hey.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.520
You're the one who after Fox was like,

03:19.520 --> 03:21.520
I'm sick of being the not.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.520
So sloppy, the sloppy one.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.520
Yeah, I want to be the not sloppy boy.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.520
Everyone knows me as the sloppy one.

03:26.520 --> 03:27.520
No, no, no.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.520
Yeah, no.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.520
It seemed like a great idea at the time.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.520
Okay.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.520
Hey, do you all want to hear, as long as you're here,

03:31.520 --> 03:35.520
do you want to hear a story?

03:35.520 --> 03:37.520
Is this about how the elephant got its tail?

03:37.520 --> 03:38.520
No.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.520
Griffin, are you going to leave the sunglasses on?

03:40.520 --> 03:41.520
Probably.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.520
Yeah.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
Although this is fucked up.

03:43.520 --> 03:49.520
I can see my own eyeballs because of the lights.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.520
I'm going to spend this entire show

03:52.520 --> 04:00.520
delivering all my incredible jokes to myself point blank.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.520
Now, Griffin, you mean you can see the reflection

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
of your own eyeballs, right?

04:03.520 --> 04:10.520
I don't even know anymore where, it might be Damien.

04:10.520 --> 04:14.520
I think he wants out.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.520
My, did you make a deal with Khonshu?

04:18.520 --> 04:19.520
Because this could be a problem.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.520
I want to hear Justin's incredible story.

04:21.520 --> 04:26.520
You all know my Grandpa Dan?

04:26.520 --> 04:31.520
He's Sidney's grandfather on her dad's side.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.520
Grandpa Dan?

04:32.520 --> 04:33.520
He went to Auburn?

04:33.520 --> 04:35.520
Okay.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.520
He's a southern fellow and he kind of talks like this

04:39.520 --> 04:42.520
when I do an impression of him.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.520
It's more the essence of Grandpa Dan.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.520
It was, the story starts off sad.

04:47.520 --> 04:52.520
He had a fall and he's so old that he couldn't get up from it.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.520
Why are you laughing at that?

04:54.520 --> 04:55.520
That's so mean.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.520
We're not to the funny part yet.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.520
Still laughing.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.520
You monsters.

04:58.520 --> 04:59.520
So he fell over.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.520
He fell and he couldn't get up.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.520
What's funny about that?

05:01.520 --> 05:03.520
He fell and he couldn't get up or get to the phone

05:03.520 --> 05:05.520
or call anybody and eventually we went over and he'd been,

05:05.520 --> 05:07.520
and we had to take him to the hospital and we thought.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.520
Pretty funny, huh?

05:08.520 --> 05:09.520
Yeah.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.520
Pretty funny stuff.

05:10.520 --> 05:11.520
Shuckle busters.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.520
Keep it going.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
Let me get past this part, okay?

05:13.520 --> 05:14.520
Yeah, no, please, Justin.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.520
No, Justin, they're relishing in it.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
They're loving this.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
Yeah, their sides are slitting.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
They're going to have to go to the hospital now

05:19.520 --> 05:21.520
to have their sides stitched up.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.520
He thought he was going to die.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.520
Yeah.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.520
Because he's old.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.520
All right.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.520
He's not.

05:29.520 --> 05:36.520
He didn't, which is not the story,

05:36.520 --> 05:39.520
but it is important to know that Grandpa Dan

05:39.520 --> 05:41.520
has been a reserved man his whole life

05:41.520 --> 05:46.520
and he's never done a lot of stuff that you've done,

05:46.520 --> 05:49.520
like, for instance, go to Taco Bell.

05:49.520 --> 05:57.520
So my 88-year-old Grandpa Dan this week went to Taco Bell

05:57.520 --> 06:00.520
for the first time in his life.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.520
Now, is this...

06:02.520 --> 06:06.520
Are we calling this like a backdoor Munch Squad light?

06:06.520 --> 06:07.520
No, it's not.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.520
I mean, it is important to remember that brand eating

06:09.520 --> 06:11.520
affects all of us in different ways.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.520
Right, sure, yeah.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.520
So Grandpa Dan goes to Taco Bell.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.520
That's my favorite children's book, by the way.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.520
Yeah.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.520
Grandpa Dan goes to Taco Bell,

06:20.520 --> 06:23.520
and as he related the story, he said...

06:23.520 --> 06:25.520
Well, I looked at the menu and I just...

06:25.520 --> 06:28.520
I had no idea what to order.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.520
It's overwhelming.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.520
So I got a taco.

06:32.520 --> 06:37.520
He got...

06:37.520 --> 06:40.520
It could be worse.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.520
He could have ordered a bell.

06:43.520 --> 06:50.520
He got a taco with beef and lettuce,

06:50.520 --> 06:54.520
and he said he was not impressed.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.520
No.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.520
You've really tied Taco Bell's hands behind its back.

07:00.520 --> 07:04.520
Not only that, but I love that no one had told Dan

07:04.520 --> 07:05.520
up to that point,

07:05.520 --> 07:08.520
if your expectation is to be impressed...

07:08.520 --> 07:09.520
Well, no, you're not going to be impressed

07:09.520 --> 07:12.520
with a crunchy hard shell taco and beef and lettuce.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.520
No one would be.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.520
So Tommy got on his case.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.520
That's Sidney's dad.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.520
He said, oh, you should have let me take you

07:18.520 --> 07:19.520
because Tommy's got a whole thing, right?

07:19.520 --> 07:22.520
He's banging out a customized crunch wrap

07:22.520 --> 07:24.520
with beans and nacho cheese on there

07:24.520 --> 07:26.520
and like a quesadilla and stuff like that.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.520
And I was telling Sidney, he can't do that.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.520
No.

07:30.520 --> 07:35.520
You can't jump 40 years of Taco Bell evolution.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.520
There's got to be a middle ground there.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.520
You're handing a caveman a Swiffer wet jet at that point.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.520
He can't contextualize what are floors.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.520
You know, like he can't contextualize a Swiffer wet jet

07:47.520 --> 07:49.520
in much the same way that if you hand that man

07:49.520 --> 07:51.520
a naked chicken chalupa.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.520
No way.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.520
He's down on the ground again.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.520
He's down on the ground again.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.520
But we are going to make a return trip to Taco Bell

07:59.520 --> 08:00.520
with Grandpa Dan.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.520
My plan is just to get him one thing from each decade

08:04.520 --> 08:08.520
so we can ease him into the naked chicken chalupa

08:08.520 --> 08:10.520
quesadilla supreme.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.520
Can you imagine sitting down and doing like the Munch Squad

08:13.520 --> 08:15.520
about the giant cheese that to start it to Grandpa Dan?

08:15.520 --> 08:16.520
Oh my God.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.520
Where he's like, wait, did I die and wake up

08:17.520 --> 08:18.520
in an alternate universe?

08:18.520 --> 08:20.520
Is that what's happening here?

08:20.520 --> 08:21.520
I mean, I don't know.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.520
I mean, I just, the lack of cheese on there

08:24.520 --> 08:25.520
is really fucking with me.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.520
Yeah, right?

08:26.520 --> 08:29.520
Anyway, it is, he didn't want to go that far outside

08:29.520 --> 08:30.520
of his comfort zone.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.520
Anyway, cheese?

08:32.520 --> 08:33.520
I don't know.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.520
I don't know.

08:34.520 --> 08:38.520
So this is an advice show.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.520
If Grandpa Dan had asked for my advice about Taco Bell,

08:41.520 --> 08:43.520
I'm sure I would have been very helpful to him,

08:43.520 --> 08:45.520
but I was not consulted.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.520
Did he not do cinnamon twists?

08:47.520 --> 08:49.520
Because that's like the best thing at Taco Bell.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.520
We still got that, right?

08:52.520 --> 08:54.520
Yeah, he did not get cinnamon twists.

08:54.520 --> 08:59.520
No, he got a crunchy taco.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.520
I am.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.520
And he went crunchy too.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.520
I'm busting up over here.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.520
I'm trying to move on to the advice portion in Travis.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.520
It's just I never talked to Justin

09:07.520 --> 09:08.520
and I want to know what's going on.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.520
It is nice to catch up at these live events.

09:11.520 --> 09:15.520
I'm also waiting for Justin's iPad to link to his phone

09:15.520 --> 09:16.520
so he can get Wi-Fi.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.520
Yeah, you guys vamp for a second.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.520
I was trying to.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.520
I can read the first question here if you'd like.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.520
I would love that actually.

09:22.520 --> 09:28.520
He loaded it up backstage where the Wi-Fi is so nice.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.520
Swimming in it.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.520
You can feel it in the air in the green room.

09:32.520 --> 09:33.520
Oh, now I got it.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.520
Will I have...

09:36.520 --> 09:38.520
This is a brief one.

09:38.520 --> 09:48.520
Will I have time to go to Olive Garden after your show today?

09:48.520 --> 09:51.520
And that's from a something in Salt Lake.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.520
Are you here?

09:54.520 --> 09:58.520
Wait, no, this is a very important one.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.520
Are you here?

10:01.520 --> 10:02.520
Yeah.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.520
I think I heard a yeah.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.520
Okay.

10:04.520 --> 10:11.520
It's possible that they didn't come because their priorities are...

10:11.520 --> 10:12.520
They Googled it and they're like,

10:12.520 --> 10:15.520
I'm not making it to Olive Garden if I go to that show.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.520
Now, okay, so I pulled the questions

10:18.520 --> 10:22.520
and I realized something now that I didn't realize then.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.520
And I can assume what you meant,

10:25.520 --> 10:27.520
but I realize now that you just wrote like,

10:27.520 --> 10:30.520
can you go to Olive Garden after the show?

10:30.520 --> 10:31.520
Yeah.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.520
Yeah.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.520
You can go to Olive Garden anytime.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
Sure.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.520
I don't know that you'll be able to go in and dine there.

10:37.520 --> 10:38.520
It might be closed,

10:38.520 --> 10:41.520
but if you just want to see it after the show.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.520
But let me...

10:42.520 --> 10:44.520
Travis, if you came to my house,

10:44.520 --> 10:45.520
they close at 10 PM by the way,

10:45.520 --> 10:46.520
so that would be...

10:46.520 --> 10:47.520
Yeah, you got time.

10:47.520 --> 10:48.520
We can get you out of here.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.520
Yeah.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.520
We got a timer going right there.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.520
We're going to go rain pace everyone and get you out of here.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.520
It is.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.520
In time to hit the OG.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.520
At most, how far I drive?

10:56.520 --> 10:59.520
3.9 miles away.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.520
Okay.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.520
We're going to do three on course though.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.520
It's an hour and 45 minute walk.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.520
So if you're walking, you're not...

11:07.520 --> 11:08.520
You're boned, dude.

11:08.520 --> 11:09.520
13 minutes drive.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.520
There's scooters outside though.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.520
Justin did the scooter here.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.520
Oh, yeah, I guess I did.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
Thanks, Travis.

11:16.520 --> 11:21.520
Not in the tuxedo because that would have been too much.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.520
Says the guy wearing a tiara.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.520
When I got out on the app, by the way,

11:26.520 --> 11:27.520
I don't do this at home.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.520
We don't have scooters,

11:28.520 --> 11:30.520
so I was very swept up in the novelty.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.520
It was hot and I went for it.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.520
It says on the app,

11:34.520 --> 11:36.520
make sure you don't ride on sidewalks.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.520
Make sure you stay in the street.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.520
Do you want me to fucking die?

11:41.520 --> 11:42.520
Do you know how many...

11:42.520 --> 11:44.520
Do you know that's where cars is?

11:44.520 --> 11:46.520
Because they are.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.520
That's what cars is.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.520
I'm sorry, app.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.520
Cars is big scooters.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.520
Cars...

11:52.520 --> 11:54.520
You know how there's two little wheels on a little scooter

11:54.520 --> 11:56.520
and no engine but my leg?

11:56.520 --> 11:58.520
Imagine if you will.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.520
No one's impressed.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.520
If I leave the sidewalk,

12:02.520 --> 12:05.520
I lose my competitive advantage.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.520
No one's impressed by a tiny shitty car in the street,

12:09.520 --> 12:12.520
but if I zoom someone past...

12:12.520 --> 12:13.520
Thank you, Paul.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.520
Here's what we're looking at.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.520
Here's what we're looking at.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.520
We got a diagram of the drive.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.520
Here's what I cannot imagine happening

12:20.520 --> 12:23.520
in a scooter on a street scenario.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.520
How long a drive are we talking there?

12:25.520 --> 12:26.520
Fifteen.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.520
Fifteen minutes.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.520
Okay, we could get you there one minute before it closes.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.520
They ain't kicking you out after that.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
No.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.520
Because if Travis came to my house right before bedtime,

12:37.520 --> 12:39.520
I was like, can I have some spaghetti, please?

12:39.520 --> 12:42.520
Of course I would do it because he is my family.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.520
Now, it might be begrudging and it might be begrudging there as well.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.520
I might say, Griffin, I know it's 9.59,

12:48.520 --> 12:49.520
but I need some pasta.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.520
I'm carving up for a big race tomorrow like I do.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.520
And Griffin would be like, again?

12:54.520 --> 12:55.520
Can I get that?

12:55.520 --> 12:56.520
I get that?

12:56.520 --> 12:58.520
And then I would say, you got to try this new shit.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.520
It's like spaghetti but not wet

13:01.520 --> 13:05.520
and it has this crunch to it that'll...

13:05.520 --> 13:06.520
I wouldn't fall for it.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.520
Drive you wild.

13:08.520 --> 13:12.520
I'm a grown man with a pocket square.

13:12.520 --> 13:16.520
I would like to see a car wave a scooter in.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.520
Like, no, you go in front of me.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.520
Please, please.

13:19.520 --> 13:23.520
I'm happy to be behind you, a person on a scooter.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.520
Why would they up the ante?

13:26.520 --> 13:31.520
You just gave me a direction in the app about how to go

13:31.520 --> 13:35.520
and now you're like, you're ready for the big show.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.520
And now with that, at the end it says,

13:38.520 --> 13:40.520
be sure to always wear a helmet.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.520
Hey, fucko, if I had a helmet, I'd have a scooter.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.520
Yeah.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.520
Like, if I had planned for this, I certainly would have...

13:47.520 --> 13:49.520
Like, I'd have the things I need.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.520
I don't have the things I need.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.520
Is there something on there that's like,

13:52.520 --> 13:53.520
and don't go on the highway.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.520
Yes.

13:54.520 --> 13:58.520
And make sure you leave this here and get a car

13:58.520 --> 14:02.520
because you shouldn't be doing this.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.520
How about another question?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.520
I'd love that.

14:04.520 --> 14:08.520
Just give me one second.

14:08.520 --> 14:09.520
Did you close?

14:09.520 --> 14:11.520
Are you new?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.520
It's just that my battery's really low,

14:13.520 --> 14:14.520
so I'm trying to conserve it.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.520
If only you had had a chance today.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.520
I had to be ready for the 10 PM show right after this one.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.520
I get that, yeah.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.520
I'm trying to conserve.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.520
That's where we bring out the good stuff.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.520
All the jokes are the same, though.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.520
You're not missing anything.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.520
Don't worry about it.

14:26.520 --> 14:29.520
I oftentimes have a deep thirst for milk.

14:29.520 --> 14:33.520
And now the question.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.520
No.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.520
I oftentimes have a deep thirst for milk.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.520
At home, this usually isn't a problem.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.520
Wait, usually?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.520
It might be out of milk.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
Yeah.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.520
At home, this usually isn't a problem,

14:43.520 --> 14:47.520
but some bar and restaurant waitstaff are taken aback

14:47.520 --> 14:51.520
and unsure if they can help quench this desire.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.520
The problem is that on more than one occasion,

14:53.520 --> 14:55.520
the server will come back triumphant or surprised

14:55.520 --> 15:00.520
and say that they, quote, found some.

15:00.520 --> 15:05.520
Should I be worried about this unexpected surprise milk?

15:05.520 --> 15:08.520
Would not downing the glass be a dishonor

15:08.520 --> 15:10.520
upon the hard work they did?

15:10.520 --> 15:12.520
That's from Leery Lactose in Las Vegas.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.520
Are you here?

15:14.520 --> 15:15.520
All right.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.520
All right.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.520
Thanks for making the drive.

15:17.520 --> 15:23.520
That's a strong, just calcium-filled woo.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.520
So calcified that woo was.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.520
I also want to say maybe the reason they're taken aback

15:28.520 --> 15:31.520
is if you say something like, I have a deep passion for milk.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.520
Yeah, that's no good.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.520
I have an unshakable thirst for milk.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.520
If you can give me some of that beautiful mood juice, please.

15:37.520 --> 15:44.520
This is not an issue if you only eat at Dave and Buster's,

15:44.520 --> 15:47.520
because they got you.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.520
Dave and Buster's, a lot of milk there?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.520
They got milk.

15:52.520 --> 15:57.520
I had Dave and Buster's milk today.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.520
It's very ethical.

16:00.520 --> 16:04.520
They let Dave and Buster watch Netflix,

16:04.520 --> 16:07.520
and they hook them up to this apparatus.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.520
It's got plenty of vitamin D and B.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.520
Yeah.

16:11.520 --> 16:17.520
They like to watch old boxing documentaries as it withdraws.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.520
And they've actually scientifically determined

16:19.520 --> 16:22.520
there's more production during the actual fight.

16:22.520 --> 16:26.520
Yeah.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.520
It is gray.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.520
Yeah.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.520
Yeah.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.520
Don't look directly at it.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.520
And don't drink directly at it.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.520
No.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.520
And it costs 200 tickets.

16:42.520 --> 16:47.520
And don't drink Buster's before they mix it with Dave's.

16:47.520 --> 16:54.520
You know what they say, Buster before Dave, catch the wave.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.520
Dave before Buster, you're feeling flustered.

16:56.520 --> 17:04.520
Yeah.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.520
Oh, Dave and Buster's.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.520
Don't drink that milk.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
Don't drink that milk.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
You have to know.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.520
They worked so hard to bring you that milk.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.520
So?

17:13.520 --> 17:14.520
They worked hard.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.520
If you didn't want, you don't put the requirements of that

17:18.520 --> 17:20.520
on any other food item that they bring.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.520
If only there was some way, like maybe a monetary way

17:23.520 --> 17:26.520
that you could reward someone for their hard work at a restaurant

17:26.520 --> 17:29.520
that had nothing to do with you consuming 25-year-old milk.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.520
Everything's all about money.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.520
Yeah.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.520
If this is the sort of person that throws cash around

17:35.520 --> 17:38.520
to fix problems, I don't think they're quite so hung up

17:38.520 --> 17:40.520
on what the person thinks of them for ordering milk.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.520
Oh, sorry, Justin.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.520
You can't be conscientious and rich.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.520
No.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.520
I'm just saying.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.520
I would say pretty empirically no.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.520
No, yeah.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.520
Yeah, I didn't think I'd be able to ride that one too far.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.520
Yeah.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.520
Could you ask, could you drink some?

17:57.520 --> 18:00.520
Let me show you what drinking looks like.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.520
Could you drink some and say, I got to be honest with you,

18:03.520 --> 18:05.520
this is the best milk I've ever had,

18:05.520 --> 18:07.520
and I need you to bring the container

18:07.520 --> 18:09.520
so I can always buy this milk.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.520
And then you check the date surreptitiously.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.520
Is that our concern?

18:13.520 --> 18:14.520
The concern is the date, right?

18:14.520 --> 18:16.520
Yeah, you can check the date while you're having a conversation

18:16.520 --> 18:18.520
when you're like, oh, how interesting, current events.

18:18.520 --> 18:19.520
JonBenét Ramsey is missing.

18:19.520 --> 18:29.520
Oh, no.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.520
Is this Star Wars, The Phantom Menace?

18:32.520 --> 18:35.520
I love that flick.

18:35.520 --> 18:44.520
This milk is a tie-in with Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ride.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.520
Unfathomable.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.520
I mean, I know how it is.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.520
I mean, you got to have your milk.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.520
I think you just got to take your chances.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.520
Worst case scenario.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.520
No.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.520
Milk is like the worst food to say, take your chances.

18:57.520 --> 19:01.520
Yeah, I need to see it from teat to bucket to,

19:01.520 --> 19:04.520
I want Louis Pasteur to be like, you're good.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.520
You're good.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.520
You're good.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.520
I did this one myself, my man.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.520
I guess.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.520
I mean, I guess.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.520
No, it is the one food.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.520
If you say spoiled blank, the answer is,

19:16.520 --> 19:19.520
no one's ever like spoiled potato chips.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.520
It's always milk.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.520
Milk is the thing you're most worried about being bad.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.520
But expiration dates are made up by the government.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.520
Not, but to a point, Justin.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.520
Tell me about it.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.520
Thank you.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.520
They're not real.

19:30.520 --> 19:36.520
If someone said, I've been saving this yogurt for a special occasion.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.520
No, don't act like that.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.520
Worst case scenario, you got some celebratory cheese.

19:41.520 --> 19:42.520
No big deal.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.520
Sure.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.520
No, worst case scenario, you have some celebratory diarrhea.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.520
Sure.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
That too.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.520
Thank you.

19:48.520 --> 19:54.520
The neighbors we share a wall with seem to be starting a band.

19:54.520 --> 19:59.520
We've never really spoken to them, but we think they sound pretty good

19:59.520 --> 20:02.520
and want to let them know we enjoy hearing them.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.520
What is the best way to say this to them

20:05.520 --> 20:08.520
without sounding creepy or passive aggressive?

20:08.520 --> 20:13.520
That's from nosy noise neighbors in Provo.

20:13.520 --> 20:14.520
Are you here?

20:14.520 --> 20:16.520
How many of you are there?

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
Wait.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.520
Hold on.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.520
Wait.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.520
Are you here?

20:20.520 --> 20:21.520
Okay.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.520
Thank you.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
This is a fast one.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.520
I have a slam dunk answer for you.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.520
Great.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.520
That's awesome.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.520
Because I didn't want to get a hand on this ball.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
Yeah.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.520
This is about moving through these as quickly as possible.

20:30.520 --> 20:35.520
So we can get our friend Olive Garden.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.520
Change your Wi-Fi network name.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.520
Oh, yes.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.520
New band next door.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.520
Love it.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.520
I don't know that they can be that long.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
New band?

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
Cool.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.520
New band cool.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.520
N-U-B-A-N-D.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.520
Cool.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.520
New band cool would be a good name for a band.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.520
Yeah.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.520
You could also do C.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.520
If you're worried about characters, C-U with an umlaut L.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.520
Yeah.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.520
That would save you some serious.

21:02.520 --> 21:06.520
That's the same exact number of characters I feel like.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.520
Well, the umlaut's not separate.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.520
Oh, yes.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
Fine.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
Fine.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.520
That's cool, but we'll allow it.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.520
I don't think you can have an umlaut in the...

21:13.520 --> 21:14.520
Because the SSID I think would be...

21:14.520 --> 21:15.520
You'd have to have an umlaut in there.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.520
Anyway.

21:16.520 --> 21:20.520
Just go over to their phone and write it on the...

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
Love your stuff, by the way.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.520
Hold on.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.520
Do you...

21:23.520 --> 21:24.520
Are you...

21:24.520 --> 21:31.520
Are you sure you want to be the only fan of this band?

21:31.520 --> 21:35.520
Because they're in Skunk Works territory right now.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.520
They're just playing to try to figure out if it's anything.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
Yeah.

21:38.520 --> 21:44.520
I feel like if you come in that early and you're just like, bada bada bop, I'm loving

21:44.520 --> 21:45.520
it.

21:45.520 --> 21:49.520
You are setting up a wild, unrealistic expectation for support.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.520
Yeah.

21:50.520 --> 21:55.520
You could be on a date in your apartment and just hear like, hey, what do you think

21:55.520 --> 21:56.520
about this?

21:56.520 --> 21:59.520
Was that anything?

21:59.520 --> 22:00.520
You like that?

22:00.520 --> 22:01.520
Did that go too hard?

22:01.520 --> 22:02.520
Well, there's...

22:02.520 --> 22:03.520
I was worried it went too hard.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.520
There's also the possibility that they're just noodling and having fun.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.520
Yeah.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.520
They're like, I love this new band.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.520
And they're like, I guess we need to...

22:09.520 --> 22:10.520
It's not ready yet.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.520
I guess we need to start a band now, girl.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.520
It is a little presumptuous, right?

22:15.520 --> 22:17.520
It's not being played for your enjoyment.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.520
What if it's just a guy with weird sneezes?

22:20.520 --> 22:25.520
Or a very, very lonely one-man band.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.520
You knock on the door like, I love your stuff.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.520
And he's like, thanks.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.520
I'm going to walk to the kitchen sadly now.

22:32.520 --> 22:36.520
That's my impression of what a one-man band sounds like.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.520
Thanks.

22:39.520 --> 22:46.520
Before I would make this leap, I would need to know what the music of every band in the

22:46.520 --> 22:49.520
world sounds like to make sure they're not playing a CD.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.520
Oh, my God.

22:50.520 --> 22:55.520
I would need to know with 100% certainty this is a new sound, new creation, new band.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.520
Because I do not want to open up the door and be like, dude, this is fucking sick.

22:58.520 --> 23:01.520
And they're like, it's Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young?

23:01.520 --> 23:03.520
It's John Philip Sousa.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.520
John Philip Sousa?

23:05.520 --> 23:07.520
Yeah, I guess it's good.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.520
How did you get a key?

23:09.520 --> 23:10.520
Can I borrow it?

23:10.520 --> 23:13.520
Can I borrow your John Philip Sousa CD?

23:13.520 --> 23:15.520
I don't think you need to be...

23:15.520 --> 23:16.520
I was streaming it.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.520
Can I borrow your computer?

23:19.520 --> 23:24.520
I don't think you need to be a student of music to know when someone's laying it down

23:24.520 --> 23:30.520
like they're in the studio versus they're in their apartment trying to learn Master of

23:30.520 --> 23:32.520
Puppets because it was on Stranger Things.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.520
But you accept Mountain Goats, you know?

23:35.520 --> 23:41.520
Yeah, you can't tell the difference between professional band Mountain Goats and just some dudes.

23:41.520 --> 23:45.520
Someone plays early Mountain Goats through their wall, you're not going to know if it's

23:45.520 --> 23:47.520
really someone playing guitar or not.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.520
But that's why we like it.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.520
I'm not complaining, I'm just saying.

23:52.520 --> 23:55.520
You love that scuffed shit.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
Hear that, John Darnell?

23:57.520 --> 24:00.520
We love that scuffed shit.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.520
Keep it coming, baby.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.520
You know, he's writing books now.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.520
Like, leave some for the rest of us.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.520
Yeah, right.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.520
Dude.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.520
Dude.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.520
Finally, someone's putting him in his place.

24:13.520 --> 24:18.520
Somebody's finally putting that stinker John Darnell in his place.

24:18.520 --> 24:19.520
Another question?

24:19.520 --> 24:20.520
Yeah, please.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.520
I'm about to start flight school to become a pilot.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.520
Yeah.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.520
While this is an exciting step in my career, I have a problem.

24:26.520 --> 24:31.520
I am terrified of heights.

24:31.520 --> 24:35.520
I have a practice flight coming up and I really don't want to spend it slumped down my seat

24:35.520 --> 24:37.520
mortified and scrambling for a barf bag.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.520
Bad first impression.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.520
What are some ways I can overcome this fear and walk into this first flight cool as a

24:43.520 --> 24:48.520
cucumber showing them I'm super chill about heights and flying around in them?

24:48.520 --> 24:49.520
That's from my stomach.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.520
Would rather be a train conductor.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.520
Are you from Mapleton?

24:53.520 --> 24:55.520
Are you that narrows it down?

24:55.520 --> 24:58.520
Because they're a little bit embarrassed that they're trying to be a pilot when they're

24:58.520 --> 24:59.520
afraid of heights.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.520
Yeah.

25:00.520 --> 25:05.520
And they didn't realize it until they heard a stranger say it out loud.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.520
But to be fair, I was thinking about it, right?

25:07.520 --> 25:08.520
Okay.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.520
Well, two of us have almost theater degrees.

25:10.520 --> 25:11.520
You almost have a theater degree.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.520
I have a theater degree.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.520
I have a theater degree.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.520
I thought you switched to journalism.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.520
No.

25:18.520 --> 25:23.520
No, I have a minor in journalism and I use neither.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
Thank you.

25:24.520 --> 25:29.520
I went to college for five years because I have failed Spanish.

25:29.520 --> 25:36.520
I was able to, before going to college for a theater degree, act in stuff.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.520
You know what you don't get to do before going to flight school?

25:39.520 --> 25:41.520
Fly a plane to see if you like it.

25:41.520 --> 25:47.520
But you know, they didn't discover the first time they went up in the big beautiful sky,

25:47.520 --> 25:49.520
like, oh, I hate this.

25:49.520 --> 25:52.520
I wish I hadn't picked this as my job forever.

25:52.520 --> 25:57.520
I have to assume you have a parent or overbearing grandfather who is a pilot,

25:57.520 --> 25:59.520
who was like, this is the life for you.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.520
It's unfathomable.

26:02.520 --> 26:11.520
Other than astronaut, you have picked the most up job that you could possibly have.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.520
Yeah.

26:12.520 --> 26:20.520
Maybe those people that do those fucking Red Bull halo jumps are a little bit higher than you.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.520
At least they're like, I'm headed down.

26:23.520 --> 26:24.520
I'm going down.

26:24.520 --> 26:25.520
Yeah, I'm going down.

26:25.520 --> 26:26.520
I want to fix this.

26:26.520 --> 26:30.520
Also, once they're in the plane, not up to them until you reach that point.

26:30.520 --> 26:31.520
Yeah.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.520
A pilot, you're just there the whole way.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.520
Just up, up, up, up, up.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.520
You can't zone out as far as I know.

26:36.520 --> 26:42.520
I don't know why you would try to have such an up job if you don't like up.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.520
Yeah.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.520
But I will say this.

26:46.520 --> 26:51.520
In a plane, it's not really like you're going to fall.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.520
You're not going to fall out of the plane.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.520
In a perfect world.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
In a perfect world, yes.

26:57.520 --> 27:03.520
If you are, if you find yourself falling from a plane,

27:03.520 --> 27:10.520
there has been a bigger whoopsie doodle that has happened.

27:10.520 --> 27:18.520
In that context, though, I do want the pilot to be afraid of not being up anymore.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.520
Yeah.

27:19.520 --> 27:23.520
That fear is healthy, right?

27:23.520 --> 27:26.520
I don't want a pilot who's like, I don't know, man, up, down.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.520
It's all the same to me.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.520
Yeah.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.520
I want you to have a healthy, healthy man.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.520
Hey, what do you guys want?

27:33.520 --> 27:34.520
Let's show our hands.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.520
You guys want up or down?

27:35.520 --> 27:36.520
Up or down.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.520
It don't make any difference to yours truly.

27:39.520 --> 27:40.520
I'm chill either way.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.520
Either way is fine.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.520
Who wants to see the stars?

27:45.520 --> 27:46.520
I can go further up.

27:46.520 --> 27:47.520
I can go further down.

27:47.520 --> 27:48.520
You know what I hate?

27:48.520 --> 27:49.520
Radio towers.

27:49.520 --> 27:55.520
What's the number one piece of advice you give someone who's afraid of heights?

27:55.520 --> 27:56.520
What's that?

27:56.520 --> 27:57.520
Don't look down.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.520
Yeah.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.520
That is also good advice for a pilot.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.520
Keep looking forward.

28:01.520 --> 28:05.520
Because if you spend the whole flight looking out the window, they have those, right?

28:05.520 --> 28:06.520
Yeah, yeah.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.520
They probably have a cool name for them.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.520
You're going the wrong direction, you're going reverse Sully, you're hitting the geese,

28:10.520 --> 28:11.520
you're going down.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.520
Yeah.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.520
You got to look in front for geese the whole time.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.520
But the problem is that Sully was looking in front of him, saw the geese, and was like,

28:17.520 --> 28:19.520
I'm going to get those motherfuckers.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.520
You think you're so cool, geese?

28:21.520 --> 28:22.520
I'm a plain geese.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.520
Get out of my way.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.520
Oh, yeah?

28:24.520 --> 28:25.520
Okay.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.520
You bet I won't.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.520
Okay.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.520
They don't talk about that enough in the movie.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.520
No, they don't.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.520
Tom Hanks is there, and he's like, I'm a perfect angel.

28:32.520 --> 28:36.520
When really that dude was like, fuck these geese up.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.520
I lost at bar trivia last night.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.520
I'm fucking pissed.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.520
Did that happen in the movie?

28:41.520 --> 28:44.520
I'm going to shred these geese.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.520
I need to watch Sully.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
Yeah, it's a sick film.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.520
You ever seen it?

28:48.520 --> 28:49.520
No, I've never seen it.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
So anyway, let me set it up.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.520
Can we be serious now?

28:53.520 --> 28:56.520
That's my impression of Tom Hanks and Sully.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
Yeah.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.520
I'm going to stick with it, if I can say.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.520
It was really good.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
Can we be serious?

29:00.520 --> 29:02.520
I can't do it a second time.

29:02.520 --> 29:08.020
But the first time I think we can all agree sounded a lot like Thomas Hanks.

29:08.020 --> 29:11.520
No arguments here.

29:11.520 --> 29:20.920
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.520
I just had to, I got to read this verbatim.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.520
I'm sorry.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.520
It's like, I'm sorry.

29:25.520 --> 29:29.160
I'll just read it verbatim.

29:29.160 --> 29:35.400
If your power is a dream, then make the dream take flight.

29:35.400 --> 29:40.920
You and Squarespace are going to make it all right.

29:40.920 --> 29:46.800
Just a few clicks and key presses, all that you need.

29:46.800 --> 29:53.240
Whether you're making a good website or a bad website.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.520
Hi, Justin McElroy here.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.800
Squarespace will let you make good websites.

29:56.800 --> 30:02.200
They make it easy to make good websites, make tools that are simple to use, even if you're

30:02.200 --> 30:06.720
not an expert, drag and drop, beautiful, easy to make a great website.

30:06.720 --> 30:12.120
But what a lot of people won't tell you is that you are allowed to make a bad website

30:12.120 --> 30:13.120
with Squarespace.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.560
They will not step in and forbid you.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.440
They don't make it easy because everything's so beautiful and they have such great customer

30:20.440 --> 30:21.720
support.

30:21.720 --> 30:27.780
And there's a Squarespace video studio that makes videos easy and you can sell products

30:27.780 --> 30:31.200
with a physical or digital.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.440
Squarespace has all those tools.

30:32.440 --> 30:36.560
So like they don't make it easy to make a bad website.

30:36.560 --> 30:41.120
But if you want to make a bad website, they're not going to stop you.

30:41.120 --> 30:48.160
So fulfill your dream with Squarespace, whether your site is good or bad.

30:48.160 --> 30:54.800
Head on over to squarespace.com slash my brother, or you'll make me sad.

30:54.800 --> 31:00.800
There's a free trial when you're ready to launch, use offer code my brother to save

31:00.800 --> 31:06.200
10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.640
Squarespace, you can make a bad one if you want.

31:09.640 --> 31:13.600
Hey there, quick favor to ask.

31:13.600 --> 31:19.560
Will you help us out by taking a five minute survey at maximumfund.org slash survey?

31:19.560 --> 31:24.440
As you know, most of the support for Max Fund comes directly from folks like you.

31:24.440 --> 31:30.380
But many of our shows and our network also rely on limited advertising for some revenue.

31:30.380 --> 31:35.660
This survey helps us attract advertisers that are a good fit for the audiences of our shows.

31:35.660 --> 31:39.700
And it helps many of our hosts secure a bit of extra income.

31:39.700 --> 31:43.600
It should only take a few minutes to complete and you'll get a discount at Max Fund store

31:43.600 --> 31:44.880
when you do.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.320
That's maximumfund.org slash survey.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.920
Thanks.

31:49.920 --> 31:56.840
I'm Lisa Hanawalt, and I'm Emily Heller.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.760
Nine years ago, we started a podcast to try and learn something new every episode.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.800
Things have gone a little off the rails since then.

32:02.800 --> 32:09.080
Tune in to hear about low stakes, neighborhood drama, gardening, the sordid nasty underbelly

32:09.080 --> 32:15.360
of the horse girl lifestyle, hot sauce, addiction to TV and sweaty takes on celebrity culture.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.800
And the weirdest, grossest stuff you can find on Wikipedia.org.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.480
We'll read all of it no matter how gross.

32:21.480 --> 32:25.080
There's something for everyone on our podcast, Baby Geniuses.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.000
Hosted by us, two horny adult idiots.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.320
Hang out with us as we try and fail to retain any knowledge at all.

32:31.320 --> 32:45.600
Every other week on Maximum Fun.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.600
This can't be right.

32:46.600 --> 32:50.880
A haunted doll watch?

32:50.880 --> 32:54.200
I'm trying to do a show.

32:54.200 --> 32:59.400
Did you all see that Vulture did a write up about the white wine, about this new drink

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
that I invented?

33:00.400 --> 33:01.400
The drink of the summer, you mean?

33:01.400 --> 33:04.520
The drink of the summer, they called it.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.520
That's not it.

33:05.520 --> 33:06.520
Look it up.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.520
All right.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.520
Yeah.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.520
You already did that.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.520
Yeah.

33:10.520 --> 33:11.520
OK.

33:11.520 --> 33:15.880
Today we're going to be kind of zooming in, focusing in on one particular purveyor of

33:15.880 --> 33:22.280
haunted dolls, and that is haunted honeys.

33:22.280 --> 33:23.280
So this is really a haunt.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.680
I don't think that's how you spell honeys.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.280
Yeah, it is on.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.280
I'm looking at eBay.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.280
I mean, that's haunted honeys.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.000
Yeah, but it's haunted honeys.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
I'm looking at it.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
No, but I mean, it might be spelled that way, but I'm just telling you anyway.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
OK.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Travis, we get it.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
They spelled it in a different way.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
OK.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Let's...

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
Welcome to the stage, Stella.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
All right.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
All right.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Hold on.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Wait a minute.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Is that a promo code at the top?

33:50.000 --> 33:55.720
Did that get cut off, or is it really fucking 5% off?

33:55.720 --> 33:56.720
What do you want?

33:56.720 --> 33:58.280
There's slim margins here, pal.

33:58.280 --> 34:03.400
So this paranormal doll, 70s, neutral.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.400
Please read.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.400
Neutral?

34:05.400 --> 34:07.480
This doll was part of a paranormal study.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.160
You will receive the physical doll.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.160
I should hope so.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.920
Hey, stop that.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.600
This is Stella.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.040
She's in her 70s.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.080
Oh, she looks great.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.080
Yeah.

34:19.080 --> 34:22.720
Well, her vessel is 16 inches tall.

34:22.720 --> 34:26.480
Stella was not very happy with me getting her at first.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.480
What?

34:27.480 --> 34:31.600
Why would she be happy when I purchase her on the eBay service?

34:31.600 --> 34:36.240
I think once she saw the other spirits here, she realized she'll be OK.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.120
Stella passed away in the late 1800s.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.120
She thought...

34:40.120 --> 34:41.120
Wait.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.120
She's how old?

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
She...

34:43.120 --> 34:44.120
Well, she's dead.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.120
But how...

34:45.120 --> 34:47.440
Oh, so according to the Haunted Honey, she does not continue to age after that.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.440
Correct.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.440
So she's 70s.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.440
Forever.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.440
Yeah.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.440
Cool.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.440
She thought many times that her life was going to end.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.920
Then all of a sudden, she would get better.

34:55.920 --> 34:56.920
Sure.

34:56.920 --> 34:57.920
Sure.

34:57.920 --> 34:58.920
I bet there was a lot of that in the 18...

34:58.920 --> 34:59.920
Yeah, you know what?

34:59.920 --> 35:05.760
I bet pretty much everybody in the 1800s had a moment where they're like, oh, I fell down

35:05.760 --> 35:06.760
once.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.760
This is it, I guess.

35:07.760 --> 35:08.760
Wait.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.760
You guys heard about all the diseases?

35:10.760 --> 35:11.760
Yeah.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.160
I fell down at work and now my arm is green.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.480
I guess this is it.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.480
Nope.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.480
Cool.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.480
So you've talked to Grandpa Dan already.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.240
If you knew the story, you should have just said something.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.240
I think...

35:22.240 --> 35:23.240
OK.

35:23.240 --> 35:25.480
Stella had many near-death experiences throughout her life.

35:25.480 --> 35:28.360
She lives in a void of paper towels.

35:28.360 --> 35:32.320
I don't think a near-death experience is when you think you're going to be fit and you're

35:32.320 --> 35:33.320
like, ah, never mind.

35:33.320 --> 35:34.600
I'm getting better.

35:34.600 --> 35:38.000
She was known to be a bit of a careless daredevil in her younger years.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
OK.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
I can see that.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.480
Stella is neutral, but that doesn't mean she's not friendly.

35:42.480 --> 35:43.480
No.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.040
Neutral or bitter is very friendly.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.040
Yeah.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.240
She's just got somewhat of a temperamental personality.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.600
Then that's not neutral.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.120
She likes things to go her way, lol.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.120
She enjoys...

35:54.120 --> 35:55.120
Wait.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.120
Wait.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.120
Because she...

35:57.120 --> 35:58.120
Well, doesn't everyone?

35:58.120 --> 35:59.120
No.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.120
Why the lol after that sentence?

36:00.120 --> 36:01.120
Because she's like sassy, lol.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.040
But we're talking about a ghost.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.600
She enjoys a spot in the living room next to the cute decorations.

36:06.600 --> 36:10.160
She enjoys judging my company, lol.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.460
She works great with any divination tools.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.280
She's not really picky over gifts.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.460
She likes everything from jewelry to flowers.

36:16.460 --> 36:19.280
When you get her, don't forget to give her a gift and light a white candle with some

36:19.280 --> 36:21.960
incense to welcome her.

36:21.960 --> 36:27.120
I don't want to be pedantic, but jewelry to flowers is not a good scale of things.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.600
It's all the gifts that there are.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.400
Between jewelry and flowers.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.400
I'm sorry, everyone.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.320
This is a boring ass doll.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.320
Neutral.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.320
Well, maybe...

36:36.320 --> 36:37.320
I want something spicy.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.320
Maybe our...

36:38.320 --> 36:40.360
Maybe Jenga will be more to your liking.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.200
Now Jenga I can get into.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.200
Welcome to...

36:44.200 --> 36:45.200
Yes!

36:45.200 --> 36:46.200
No!

36:46.200 --> 36:47.200
Baby!

36:47.200 --> 36:48.200
Yes, baby!

36:48.200 --> 36:49.200
Branded as shit!

36:49.200 --> 36:53.800
$35 with 15% off using the code Haunted15.

36:53.800 --> 36:57.040
I do believe I will, thank you very much.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.720
This doll was part of a paranormal study.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.560
You will receive the physical doll.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.560
Yes.

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
This is Jenga.

37:03.560 --> 37:04.560
Yeah!

37:04.560 --> 37:05.560
Yeah, it is.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.560
His age is unknown, but his vessel is nine inches tall.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.560
Wink.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.560
Oh, a little guy!

37:10.560 --> 37:11.880
Wait, is there a wink in there?

37:11.880 --> 37:12.880
Nope.

37:12.880 --> 37:19.160
Jenga is in his mid-20s, except he is dead.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.520
He's a friendly little guy.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.800
He was sent to me from Canada.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.800
The lady that had him felt he may be negative.

37:26.800 --> 37:31.240
She sent me photos and videos of him, and I assured him he's positive.

37:31.240 --> 37:34.160
But she wanted him gone.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.320
Did they do your butt backwards, Jenga?

37:37.320 --> 37:41.400
Maybe his butt was knocked backwards when Jenga was hit walking along the side of the

37:41.400 --> 37:42.400
road.

37:42.400 --> 37:46.360
He was hit so hard, his butt was knocked.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.480
His butt switched sides with his privacy.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.480
We've all been there.

37:50.480 --> 37:53.880
That was my favorite Grey's Anatomy episode.

37:53.880 --> 37:54.880
I really-

37:54.880 --> 37:58.200
We can save you, but your butt's always going to be on the front.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.200
It's okay.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.200
I still love you.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.200
And nothing but.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.200
I still love you.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.200
Dr. McPoop's weird.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.200
I think it's going to be okay.

38:06.200 --> 38:11.400
I really believe that Jenga was a photographer.

38:11.400 --> 38:15.280
Does Jenga sit on the toilet like a cool teacher?

38:15.280 --> 38:21.400
Hey, we've had a lot of fun here today, but you know what's not fun?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.800
How does this doll poop?

38:23.800 --> 38:27.600
When I did his reading, I got a vision of him walking beside the road with a camera

38:27.600 --> 38:32.640
in hand, presumably moments before he was tragically killed, I guess.

38:32.640 --> 38:37.360
He's definitely got a very artistic side for a doll.

38:37.360 --> 38:41.240
He gets along great with all others, and pets just adore him.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.200
I bet they do.

38:43.200 --> 38:48.240
He loves- this sentence has never been written before.

38:48.240 --> 38:53.720
He loves any type of art as an offering, and he also likes green candy.

38:53.720 --> 39:01.880
Oh, my two turn-ons, easy, fine art and green candy.

39:01.880 --> 39:06.080
When you get in, don't forget to give a gift and some incense to welcome him.

39:06.080 --> 39:09.720
I do love how his hair has a natural windswept look.

39:09.720 --> 39:10.720
Sure.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.880
Such a festive- such a festive doll.

39:13.880 --> 39:18.720
But let's take a moment, if we may, to meet a new friend.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.720
Hold on.

39:19.720 --> 39:20.720
Wait for it.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.720
Wait.

39:21.720 --> 39:22.720
Hold on.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.720
Hi, Miguel.

39:23.720 --> 39:24.720
Shit.

39:24.720 --> 39:25.720
Oh, boy.

39:25.720 --> 39:26.720
Paul-

39:26.720 --> 39:30.120
Now, why is Miguel worth $3 more, do you think?

39:30.120 --> 39:32.040
This is Miguel.

39:32.040 --> 39:33.040
He is a teenager.

39:33.040 --> 39:40.040
Griffin, can you just read the, like, four descriptive terms there?

39:40.040 --> 39:41.720
Paul, if you'd go back.

39:41.720 --> 39:47.800
Paranormal doll, haunted honey's Miguel, M45, teen, positive, very sweet, clingy.

39:47.800 --> 39:51.560
That sounds like the description of a relationship.

39:51.560 --> 39:55.080
Like, at first, he was a teen and really positive and so sweet.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.080
So sweet.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.080
But he got a little clingy.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.320
A little clingy when college rolled around.

39:59.320 --> 40:00.320
This is Miguel.

40:00.320 --> 40:03.280
He's a teenager, and his vessel is nine inches tall.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.080
Yeah, it is.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.080
Finally.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.080
Finally.

40:07.080 --> 40:10.520
This guy is ready to find his forever home.

40:10.520 --> 40:18.760
Every time I would ask him if he was ready, I would get a strong no.

40:18.760 --> 40:20.320
Please don't sell me, mama.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.600
Please, mama.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.600
It's time, Miguel.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.600
No, no.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.040
This is my forever home.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.560
You're ready to find your forever home.

40:27.560 --> 40:28.720
I found my forever home.

40:28.720 --> 40:32.860
I need $38 for cigarettes.

40:32.860 --> 40:33.860
So this is a challenge-

40:33.860 --> 40:34.860
Mama.

40:34.860 --> 40:35.860
Mama.

40:35.860 --> 40:37.360
Can I sit on the chair?

40:37.360 --> 40:38.520
Yes, Miguel.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.400
This is a challenging sentence.

40:40.400 --> 40:44.800
He has seen some of the updates from other spirits that got adopted in their new homes,

40:44.800 --> 40:45.800
and he's ready.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.960
I thought he just said no.

40:47.960 --> 40:51.200
Yeah, but now he's finally ready.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.200
And this does-

40:52.200 --> 40:53.200
I was on the forums on Reddit.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.200
It looks great.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.200
Yeah.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.480
Is your doll on the internet?

40:57.480 --> 40:58.720
Are you-

40:58.720 --> 40:59.720
Do you have screen time?

40:59.720 --> 41:01.680
Not the internet, as we know it.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
Okay.

41:02.680 --> 41:03.680
Sort of a ethereal bae.

41:03.680 --> 41:04.680
All right.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.160
He has seen some updates.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.160
He's ready.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.160
He's seen some shit.

41:09.160 --> 41:10.160
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.160
Oh, yeah.

41:11.160 --> 41:15.320
He had a tough time in the home I got him from, and that had him scared.

41:15.320 --> 41:16.320
What?

41:16.320 --> 41:19.160
Well, Miguel passed away in the 1950s.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.880
He was a very energetic teen and known to be a daredevil.

41:22.880 --> 41:29.880
And when he ate spicy food, he turned into a car.

41:29.880 --> 41:33.520
He was a very energetic teen, and he was known to be a daredevil.

41:33.520 --> 41:37.640
He jumped out the window of the abandoned house down his street and ended up breaking

41:37.640 --> 41:38.640
his neck.

41:38.640 --> 41:43.200
And folks, I'm here to tell you, that'll do it every time.

41:43.200 --> 41:47.400
I love that version of It's a Wonderful Life, where it's like, I'm going to buy that house

41:47.400 --> 41:49.640
and live in it when we get older and married.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.640
He's like, oh, yeah?

41:50.640 --> 41:52.520
Well, check this shit out.

41:52.520 --> 41:53.520
Ooh, crack.

41:53.520 --> 41:57.160
Murray, you got to call someone married.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.160
I'm actually going to go.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.160
I can't.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.160
I got some prior.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.160
What?

42:01.160 --> 42:02.160
Joseph?

42:02.160 --> 42:03.160
Did that man just die?

42:03.160 --> 42:04.160
Dude, job's off.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.160
You're good, Clarence.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.160
He went hardcore this time.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.160
One, two, three, and fuck it.

42:07.160 --> 42:08.160
So he jumped out the window.

42:08.160 --> 42:25.240
He just a very, such an energetic teen that he is a daredevil.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.680
Like a daredevil is one thing, right?

42:27.680 --> 42:28.680
We all know what that means.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.680
I don't think it means, hey, check this out.

42:31.680 --> 42:35.000
I do think, listen, once again, stupid abandonment.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.360
Hey, you guys want to see a dead body?

42:37.360 --> 42:38.360
Cool.

42:38.360 --> 42:44.440
Once again, not to be pathetic, I think a daredevil has to at least survive one thing.

42:44.440 --> 42:45.440
Sure.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.720
He got to do one thing.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.760
Oh, man.

42:48.760 --> 42:51.140
So he broke his neck.

42:51.140 --> 42:53.440
He was so surprised.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.440
He was so surprised.

42:54.440 --> 42:55.440
Yeah.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.440
No, not about that.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.440
Okay.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.440
Not about that.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.440
What?

42:59.440 --> 43:03.000
Well, I thought I could stick that shit.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.040
He was surprised to see all the gifts and people who showed up to support and honor

43:07.040 --> 43:11.880
him at his funeral, which like after the dumb shit he pulled, I get it, I guess.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.000
I wouldn't be surprised if people showed up for me too.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.680
Miguel is very sweet.

43:16.680 --> 43:20.080
He will bond deeply with anyone who shows him kindness.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.880
He works great with any divination tools.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.280
He enjoys going through the home.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.000
Great at Adobe.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.680
Making little tipping and clacking noises.

43:29.680 --> 43:33.640
When you get him home, don't forget to give him a gift and light a white candle with some

43:33.640 --> 43:35.760
incense to welcome him.

43:35.760 --> 43:39.680
And I am only reading this end part that's at the end of all the posts because we're

43:39.680 --> 43:41.880
coming up on the end of the show here in a little bit.

43:41.880 --> 43:45.040
Follow Haunted Honeys on Instagram and TikTok.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.040
Thank you.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.040
Yes.

43:47.040 --> 43:50.240
But hey, listen, as somebody who's been by there, who ducked his head in a little bit

43:50.240 --> 43:58.160
earlier today, you better really be sure that you want to check in a lot of these on TikTok.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.160
Okay?

43:59.160 --> 44:00.160
Uh-huh.

44:00.160 --> 44:04.360
And don't leave weird comments because I'm tired of people selling dolls, putting notes

44:04.360 --> 44:08.800
in the boxes that are like, I checked out your podcast, it was really funny.

44:08.800 --> 44:11.640
And then they have my home address and I don't like that.

44:11.640 --> 44:16.080
So please stop talking to the people who sell the dolls, everyone.

44:16.080 --> 44:18.520
Anyway, that's our Haunted Doll Watch.

44:18.520 --> 44:19.520
Thank you for that.

44:19.520 --> 44:26.640
Let's, let's take it to the streets with some live audience questions.

44:26.640 --> 44:29.320
We have prepared a list of people we're going to call you down.

44:29.320 --> 44:30.600
Please do not approach the microphone.

44:30.600 --> 44:31.600
Oh, bye Justin.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.600
Hello.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.600
Yeah.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.600
Um, my name's Laurie.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.600
I go by she, her.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.600
Hi Laurie.

44:36.600 --> 44:37.600
Hi Laurie.

44:37.600 --> 44:45.400
And my question is, I wrote a steamy alien romance book and I need a title for it.

44:45.400 --> 44:48.720
Can you give us, yeah, like a paragraph synopsis?

44:48.720 --> 44:55.800
Imagine being in the back and, and getting all worked up.

44:55.800 --> 44:59.920
What sort of the, you know, what's the summation?

44:59.920 --> 45:04.480
It's about this girl who gets kidnapped by aliens, well, abducted, I guess is the right

45:04.480 --> 45:05.480
term.

45:05.480 --> 45:06.480
Yeah.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.480
Sure.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.480
That's the term they prefer.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.480
Yeah.

45:09.480 --> 45:14.160
But you're the writer, of course, any word choice that you want to go with?

45:14.160 --> 45:15.160
Okay.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
Go ahead.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.160
Spin your web.

45:17.160 --> 45:21.320
Yeah, that's true.

45:21.320 --> 45:28.960
And then, so she escapes the aliens and becomes a bounty hunter, but then she falls in love

45:28.960 --> 45:35.240
with an alien, um, who she's supposed to capture and they have a fun time together.

45:35.240 --> 45:46.080
So the first two that occurred to me is beam me up lover and booty bounty 2099.

45:46.080 --> 45:50.320
Booty bounty 2099, is that what you said?

45:50.320 --> 45:51.320
Yeah.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.320
Okay.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.320
Is it set near 2099?

45:53.320 --> 45:54.320
Could it be?

45:54.320 --> 45:55.320
Could it be set near 2099?

45:55.320 --> 45:56.320
It could be.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.320
Yeah.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.320
It's 77 years from now.

45:58.320 --> 45:59.320
Are you sure?

45:59.320 --> 46:03.520
Hey, Griffin, you can't assume that aliens use the same calendar we do.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.520
Yeah, that's fair.

46:04.520 --> 46:05.520
That's so weird.

46:05.520 --> 46:10.920
We're actually on the same month, 77 years difference.

46:10.920 --> 46:15.680
It's also January.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.680
Then what about closer encounters?

46:18.680 --> 46:21.680
Oh, that's good.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.760
I like that one.

46:24.760 --> 46:37.000
Or it could be close encounters of the fourth kind, which is doing it.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.620
What about probe me regular?

46:41.620 --> 46:45.840
What about probe me globular?

46:45.840 --> 46:53.540
Is the characters name globular and it's important to ask, get your hands on me, you bitch.

46:53.540 --> 47:01.860
Is he a big gelatinous sphere that you can climb inside and be transported into an dimension

47:01.860 --> 47:02.860
of X?

47:02.860 --> 47:05.120
Let me finish!

47:05.120 --> 47:06.120
Area 69.

47:06.120 --> 47:18.840
And here's the thing, I know I just said it.

47:18.840 --> 47:22.320
There's no way that's not taken.

47:22.320 --> 47:27.000
What about, no, seriously, welcome to earth.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
What about cocoon two?

47:29.000 --> 47:33.400
Actually, I think it's already a movie.

47:33.400 --> 47:38.280
What about cocoon three?

47:38.280 --> 47:40.800
One of those has got to help, right?

47:40.800 --> 47:41.800
What about Uranus?

47:41.800 --> 47:42.800
Call my, am I right?

47:42.800 --> 47:43.800
Yeah.

47:43.800 --> 47:44.800
Okay.

47:44.800 --> 47:45.800
Thank you very much.

47:45.800 --> 47:46.800
Thank you.

47:46.800 --> 47:57.160
Also, if you use any of those TM, TM, TM, TM, TM, TM.

47:57.160 --> 47:58.160
Hello.

47:58.160 --> 47:59.160
Hi, I'm Erin.

47:59.160 --> 48:00.160
Hi, Erin.

48:00.160 --> 48:03.360
My question is immediately actionable.

48:03.360 --> 48:04.360
Yeah, please, please.

48:04.360 --> 48:08.440
So before the show, I was playing with my fidget because I got ADHD, so I got it on

48:08.440 --> 48:09.440
your baby.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.440
And I did.

48:10.440 --> 48:13.440
I have dropped it on my face before.

48:13.440 --> 48:14.440
Okay.

48:14.440 --> 48:15.440
I dropped it.

48:15.440 --> 48:16.440
It is an orb.

48:16.440 --> 48:19.680
It is a crystal orb and it rolled forward and I thought I'd never see it again, but

48:19.680 --> 48:21.960
I figured I'd toss out into the audience.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.960
Who's got the orb?

48:22.960 --> 48:23.960
Who's got the orb?

48:23.960 --> 48:24.960
Who's got the orb?

48:24.960 --> 48:25.960
Jesus Christ.

48:25.960 --> 48:26.960
The orb made it so far.

48:26.960 --> 48:27.960
Erin, the orb went.

48:27.960 --> 48:28.960
Wait, Erin, where were you sitting?

48:28.960 --> 48:33.960
I was sitting in the back.

48:33.960 --> 48:34.960
Erin, where were you sitting?

48:34.960 --> 48:35.960
The very back.

48:35.960 --> 48:36.960
The very back?

48:36.960 --> 48:37.960
The very back?

48:37.960 --> 48:38.960
That little orb.

48:38.960 --> 48:39.960
It was like the fucking forest goat feather.

48:39.960 --> 48:40.960
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

48:40.960 --> 48:41.960
I have to know.

48:41.960 --> 48:42.960
I have to know.

48:42.960 --> 48:43.960
It was like the beach ball stuff.

48:43.960 --> 48:47.400
Raise your hand if something bumped your foot during the show.

48:47.400 --> 48:48.400
Now hold on.

48:48.400 --> 48:49.400
Now hold on.

48:49.400 --> 48:50.400
There's a record.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.400
I have so many questions.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.400
The voyage of the boy.

48:52.400 --> 48:53.400
An incredible journey.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
Can you approach the microphone please?

48:54.400 --> 49:00.680
I need to know the story of the person who orb rolled up to your feet.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.480
And you were like, hmm, free orb.

49:02.480 --> 49:06.800
No, but wouldn't this be wild if it's a different orb?

49:06.800 --> 49:07.800
I would not.

49:07.800 --> 49:09.000
No, that's not mine.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
That's a different orb.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Is that the correct orb?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.480
It is the correct orb.

49:12.480 --> 49:13.480
It's the right orb.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.480
We got the orb back in Erin's hands everybody.

49:14.480 --> 49:15.480
Yes.

49:15.480 --> 49:16.480
Hey, big cheer.

49:16.480 --> 49:17.960
You'll love to see it.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.920
I love it.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.640
We need to do more of those, by the way.

49:21.640 --> 49:23.920
We've never done lost and found audience questions.

49:23.920 --> 49:24.920
I love that.

49:24.920 --> 49:25.920
It's really great.

49:25.920 --> 49:26.920
You know what I like?

49:26.920 --> 49:27.920
No jokes required.

49:27.920 --> 49:28.920
Yeah.

49:28.920 --> 49:29.920
Yeah.

49:29.920 --> 49:30.920
And it does something good.

49:30.920 --> 49:31.920
Okay.

49:31.920 --> 49:32.920
Next up.

49:32.920 --> 49:33.920
Hello.

49:33.920 --> 49:34.920
Approach the microphone.

49:34.920 --> 49:35.920
Welcome.

49:35.920 --> 49:36.920
Welcome.

49:36.920 --> 49:37.920
Hi.

49:37.920 --> 49:38.920
My name is Kaylee.

49:38.920 --> 49:39.920
Hi, Kaylee.

49:39.920 --> 49:40.920
Hi, Kaylee.

49:40.920 --> 49:43.320
Me and my fiancé are getting married next year, and he's pretty insistent that we cut

49:43.320 --> 49:45.320
our wedding cake with a sword.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.320
Yeah.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.320
Hell yeah.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.320
You only...

49:48.320 --> 49:49.320
Okay.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.320
And I keep trying to tell him no.

49:52.320 --> 49:53.320
Why?

49:53.320 --> 49:54.320
Yeah.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.320
I agree.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.320
What?

49:56.320 --> 49:57.320
No.

49:57.320 --> 49:58.320
Kaylee needs our support right now.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.320
Okay.

49:59.320 --> 50:00.320
It seems great.

50:00.320 --> 50:02.320
Here's the problem, right?

50:02.320 --> 50:03.320
No.

50:03.320 --> 50:04.320
Was that the rest of the question?

50:04.320 --> 50:05.320
Sorry, Kaylee.

50:05.320 --> 50:06.320
Oh, yeah.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.320
How do I tell him no?

50:07.320 --> 50:08.320
Yeah.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.320
He actually listens.

50:09.320 --> 50:10.320
I...

50:10.320 --> 50:11.320
You cut...

50:11.320 --> 50:12.320
Think about it, folks.

50:12.320 --> 50:14.320
You cut the cake with the sword once.

50:14.320 --> 50:15.320
Great.

50:15.320 --> 50:18.320
But you got to cut a lot of slices of cake.

50:18.320 --> 50:19.320
Sure.

50:19.320 --> 50:24.400
Kaylee, you're just sitting there with a sword like a doofus, cutting small slices with a

50:24.400 --> 50:26.560
sword, and you look ridiculous.

50:26.560 --> 50:33.440
I will say, at mine and Rachel's wedding, it was like 20 degrees outside, and we could

50:33.440 --> 50:36.600
not get through our cake.

50:36.600 --> 50:45.880
And had I known in the moment that having a fucking Hattori Hanzo steel was an option,

50:45.880 --> 50:48.000
I would have taken it.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.240
Now, I'm getting...

50:50.240 --> 50:55.320
This isn't funny, but have a groom's cake that your groom can cut with a sword.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.320
Can fuck up like a doofus.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.920
You're going to want to have two.

50:57.920 --> 51:02.080
Like you do at a one-year-old's birthday party, you know?

51:02.080 --> 51:03.080
Yeah.

51:03.080 --> 51:04.920
This one's just for him, everybody.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.920
Let him have his fun.

51:07.920 --> 51:09.980
Yeah.

51:09.980 --> 51:16.000
One cool thing that you could do is say absolutely, and then when he rears back and he's like

51:16.000 --> 51:19.880
swings forward, you pull out a short sword, block him.

51:19.880 --> 51:20.880
Hell yeah, dude.

51:20.880 --> 51:21.880
No, wait.

51:21.880 --> 51:22.880
Okay.

51:22.880 --> 51:23.880
I am immortal.

51:23.880 --> 51:27.480
I have inside me blood of kings.

51:27.480 --> 51:30.800
And then long eye contact.

51:30.800 --> 51:31.800
Not today.

51:31.800 --> 51:32.800
And then it's...

51:32.800 --> 51:33.800
That's first dance right there, baby.

51:33.800 --> 51:34.800
Yeah.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.800
Yeah.

51:35.800 --> 51:36.800
I don't know what happens after that.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.800
Maybe I'll sword fight or get hurt or something.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.480
Then you throw sand in his eyes.

51:39.480 --> 51:40.480
Yeah.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.480
That's good.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.480
No.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.480
No.

51:43.480 --> 51:44.480
Icing sugar.

51:44.480 --> 51:45.480
Icing sugar.

51:45.480 --> 51:49.520
And then you hook onto the roof and then you run away.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.520
You stab him.

51:50.520 --> 51:51.520
You cut his head off.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.520
Cut off his fucking head.

51:52.520 --> 51:55.600
At a certain point, your stunt doubles have taken over.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.600
It's fine.

51:56.600 --> 51:57.600
Yeah, yeah.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.600
You're not doing any more.

51:58.600 --> 51:59.600
This is all CG.

51:59.600 --> 52:00.600
Does your...

52:00.600 --> 52:03.860
Do you have the budget to motion capture your...

52:03.860 --> 52:06.920
Does your fiance know how to use a sword?

52:06.920 --> 52:07.920
Not yet, no.

52:07.920 --> 52:08.920
Okay.

52:08.920 --> 52:09.920
So let me tell you.

52:09.920 --> 52:14.360
It's not as easy as I make it look in the movies.

52:14.360 --> 52:15.640
And I know what you're...

52:15.640 --> 52:16.640
Are you here, fiance?

52:16.640 --> 52:17.640
Yeah.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.640
Yeah.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.640
Okay.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.640
I know you're thinking, big knife.

52:20.640 --> 52:21.640
It's different.

52:21.640 --> 52:22.640
Now, listen.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.640
It's not going to be...

52:23.640 --> 52:24.640
Listen.

52:24.640 --> 52:25.640
No, no, no.

52:25.640 --> 52:29.600
Now, here we see Queen Elizabeth cutting a cake with a saber.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.600
I believe the wrong way.

52:30.600 --> 52:31.600
Yeah, the wrong...

52:31.600 --> 52:32.600
Yeah, hey, guys.

52:32.600 --> 52:33.600
Hey, guys.

52:33.600 --> 52:37.560
It actually looks like she's pointing to a part of the cake with the...

52:37.560 --> 52:38.560
Right about here?

52:38.560 --> 52:39.560
Right about here.

52:39.560 --> 52:40.560
Can we not...

52:40.560 --> 52:43.720
Can we not actually the Queen of England cutting a cake with a sword?

52:43.720 --> 52:46.160
I bet she probably knows what she's doing, right?

52:46.160 --> 52:51.160
Now, Justin, I'm sorry, but nothing about the Queen's face here is, I know what I'm

52:51.160 --> 52:52.160
doing.

52:52.160 --> 52:53.160
Step back, idiots.

52:53.160 --> 52:58.160
Look at the guy in the pink striped tie in the background.

52:58.160 --> 53:00.200
Is everyone like, do you believe this?

53:00.200 --> 53:01.200
Can I say...

53:01.200 --> 53:04.320
Okay, real quick about this guy.

53:04.320 --> 53:08.320
The Queen of England is cutting a cake with a sword?

53:08.320 --> 53:10.920
Fucking stand up and go check that shit out, man.

53:10.920 --> 53:14.960
How are you sitting there like, oh, this happens to me constantly?

53:14.960 --> 53:19.360
Okay, that guy is so thrilled beyond...

53:19.360 --> 53:23.920
That person has been big from a 12-year-old child to that age.

53:23.920 --> 53:28.240
Anyway, so sorry, Kaylee, but I do need to ask, do you think Queen Elizabeth has eaten

53:28.240 --> 53:29.240
Taco Bell before?

53:29.240 --> 53:30.240
Probably not, right?

53:30.240 --> 53:31.240
No.

53:31.240 --> 53:32.240
No, probably not.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.640
What do you think she'd go with?

53:35.640 --> 53:38.040
Oh, if she did?

53:38.040 --> 53:39.040
Yeah.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.040
Yeah.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.040
I think she'd go with the pink.

53:41.040 --> 53:42.040
For sure.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.040
Can I tell you?

53:43.040 --> 53:44.040
No joke.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.040
That was right there in my brain.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.040
Okay.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.040
Has anything we've done today helped?

53:47.040 --> 53:48.040
Yeah.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.040
Okay.

53:49.040 --> 53:50.040
Thank you.

53:50.040 --> 53:51.040
Thank you, Kaylee.

53:51.040 --> 53:52.040
Thank you, Kaylee.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.040
Congratulations, everybody.

53:53.040 --> 53:54.040
Congrats.

53:54.040 --> 53:59.280
We need to wrap up soon if they're going to get to Olive Garden.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.280
Yes.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.280
Charles, make it snappy.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
Okay.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.280
Hi, Charles.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.280
I'm Charles.

54:04.280 --> 54:05.280
He him.

54:05.280 --> 54:06.280
Hi, Charles.

54:06.280 --> 54:11.040
I tried to get my surgical instructor not to fail me after I made her listen to ska for

54:11.040 --> 54:14.240
the entire duration of a seven-hour surgery.

54:14.240 --> 54:18.280
Now, wait, Charles, here's my question.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.280
Sure.

54:19.280 --> 54:23.080
Have they expressed to you frustration about this?

54:23.080 --> 54:25.480
Four hours in, they looked at me, and were kind of like—

54:25.480 --> 54:26.480
Four hours?

54:26.480 --> 54:28.560
They made it four fucking hours, huh, Charles?

54:28.560 --> 54:31.440
It kind of plays low in the background because they don't want it to be distracting, but

54:31.440 --> 54:36.360
at a particularly long trumpet solo, they looked at me and were like, this is interesting.

54:36.360 --> 54:37.360
Yeah, sure.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.360
Now, hold on, Charles.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.360
Hold on.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.360
You all have—

54:40.360 --> 54:41.360
Is it possible that—

54:41.360 --> 54:42.360
Hey, wait, wait, real quick.

54:42.360 --> 54:43.360
I need to know if this is a universal experience.

54:43.360 --> 54:49.600
Have you ever played music for a gathering or a group of people or just one person, and

54:49.600 --> 54:53.720
you get to a point in the music where you're like, they're not going to like this?

54:53.720 --> 54:54.720
Yes.

54:54.720 --> 54:57.880
I'm seeing a lot of nodding like, oh, man, this is really grating.

54:57.880 --> 55:00.080
I really wish this would sink back into the background.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.680
I feel really weird about this now.

55:01.680 --> 55:02.680
I want to quit.

55:02.680 --> 55:03.680
Can we quit?

55:03.680 --> 55:04.680
Charles?

55:04.680 --> 55:05.680
Charles?

55:05.680 --> 55:11.640
Someone, while you're performing surgery, saying, well, this is interesting.

55:11.640 --> 55:15.200
Is it possible it was not music-related at all?

55:15.200 --> 55:19.240
What were you doing in that moment with your hands?

55:19.240 --> 55:23.440
I was just standing there holding the retractor uncomfortably, sweating, because I—

55:23.440 --> 55:24.440
How uncomfortably?

55:24.440 --> 55:25.440
What's a retractor?

55:25.440 --> 55:26.440
Wait, wait, wait.

55:26.440 --> 55:27.440
Sorry, sorry.

55:27.440 --> 55:34.040
Were you skanking it while you were holding the retractor, because that will, that is

55:34.040 --> 55:35.480
no good, my friend.

55:35.480 --> 55:37.280
That goes right against that Hippocratic Oath.

55:37.280 --> 55:45.480
The Hippocratic Oath should say, do no harm, and also, when someone is open, don't skank

55:45.480 --> 55:48.620
it right next to them.

55:48.620 --> 55:49.620
Skanking is generally discouraging.

55:49.620 --> 55:56.480
Are you kind of a loose cannon surgeon, who like, scaw powers you through?

55:56.480 --> 56:04.200
Have you ever had to knock on wood?

56:04.200 --> 56:08.840
What's great is you could, you know, there could be like a, you know, I don't know much

56:08.840 --> 56:10.840
about medicine, but like an aorta explodes.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.480
I know less about scaw.

56:12.480 --> 56:13.560
Yeah, right?

56:13.560 --> 56:19.400
But an aorta explodes while you're doing heart surgery, and it's like, the pressure is on,

56:19.400 --> 56:24.600
and then you can just look at the like, commanding surgeon, officer, and just be like, pick it

56:24.600 --> 56:25.600
up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.

56:25.600 --> 56:34.200
This man needs mouth to mouth, as you trombone into his mouth.

56:34.200 --> 56:36.000
Trombone in his mouth, yeah.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.240
Trombone into my mouth is.

56:39.240 --> 56:43.800
That's a good name for your book, if you can have an alien play trombone.

56:43.800 --> 56:46.440
From the creators of Call Me By Your Name.

56:46.440 --> 56:49.000
Charles, I've lost the plot.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.960
How can we help here?

56:50.960 --> 56:55.280
Hey, go to your commanding surgical officer, Griffon Assange.

56:55.280 --> 56:57.080
As Griffon has said, yeah.

56:57.080 --> 57:01.100
Did you know Oscar Isaac was in a scaw band before he became famous?

57:01.100 --> 57:02.760
You're going to change the story.

57:02.760 --> 57:03.760
Sure.

57:03.760 --> 57:04.760
He was in the Blinking Underdogs.

57:04.760 --> 57:06.080
This is true.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.080
I'm just a big fan.

57:07.080 --> 57:08.080
Their music rules.

57:08.080 --> 57:09.080
Yeah.

57:09.080 --> 57:10.080
Sure.

57:10.080 --> 57:11.840
What are some of your favorite scaw bands?

57:11.840 --> 57:15.720
Everyone in the room.

57:15.720 --> 57:17.560
Did they pull through?

57:17.560 --> 57:18.560
Oh, yeah.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.560
The surgery went great.

57:19.560 --> 57:20.560
Great.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.600
You can't say, oh, yeah, like it's obvious.

57:22.600 --> 57:23.600
From what I understand.

57:23.600 --> 57:25.800
It was seven hours long.

57:25.800 --> 57:28.040
Charles was behind the retractor.

57:28.040 --> 57:29.400
Of course it went smooth.

57:29.400 --> 57:30.400
Yeah, sure.

57:30.400 --> 57:34.240
Nothing detracted when it wasn't supposed to.

57:34.240 --> 57:38.560
Did the patient wake up and was like, what the fuck was that?

57:38.560 --> 57:40.560
Because I loved it.

57:40.560 --> 57:49.280
You have my brain open and I got that shit without the radiation shielding of my skull

57:49.280 --> 57:50.280
and skin.

57:50.280 --> 57:55.200
And you're not supposed to.

57:55.200 --> 57:58.480
I will say I followed up on them over the past several days and they have seemed pretty

57:58.480 --> 57:59.480
chill.

57:59.480 --> 58:00.480
Okay.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.480
Wait.

58:01.480 --> 58:02.480
The patient?

58:02.480 --> 58:03.480
Yeah.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.480
Yeah.

58:04.480 --> 58:05.480
Nailed it.

58:05.480 --> 58:06.480
Yeah.

58:06.480 --> 58:07.480
I mean, you crushed it.

58:07.480 --> 58:08.480
Did that happen?

58:08.480 --> 58:09.480
Now, you know what it sounds like now.

58:09.480 --> 58:10.480
You got to write a paper about scaw, my man.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.480
Yeah.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.240
The power of scaw.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.720
And don't research it anymore.

58:14.720 --> 58:15.720
You have all the evidence you need.

58:15.720 --> 58:16.720
You did it.

58:16.720 --> 58:17.720
Trust me.

58:17.720 --> 58:20.720
Does that help, Charles?

58:20.720 --> 58:21.720
Yes.

58:21.720 --> 58:22.720
Thank you.

58:22.720 --> 58:23.720
Thank you.

58:23.720 --> 58:24.720
Thank you.

58:24.720 --> 58:25.720
Goodbye.

58:25.720 --> 58:26.720
Thank you.

58:26.720 --> 58:41.560
This is, I don't know, Salt Lake City has, this is our second show here, it is so fun

58:41.560 --> 58:42.560
every time.

58:42.560 --> 58:43.560
Yeah.

58:43.560 --> 58:45.280
We all get so rowdy and I'm so excited to be here.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.840
I'm very, very here for it.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.840
Thank you.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.840

A huge thank you to Schmanners.

59:03.240 --> 59:09.000
Thank you to Paul Saboren of Paul and Storm fame.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.560
Thank you to the Abravanel Theater for having us.

59:11.560 --> 59:14.680
This is our second show here and it's absolutely gorgeous.

59:14.680 --> 59:17.120
Thank you to Tyler Reed for the amazing posters.

59:17.120 --> 59:18.120
Yes.

59:18.120 --> 59:21.000
Grab yourself a poster on your way out if there are still some.

59:21.000 --> 59:26.760
Thank you to Rachel, yes, for manning the ones and twos over there recording our audio.

59:26.760 --> 59:27.760
Sometimes even the threes.

59:27.760 --> 59:28.760
Yeah.

59:28.760 --> 59:29.760
I know.

59:29.760 --> 59:30.760
It got wild.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.760
Clinton McElroy.

59:31.760 --> 59:37.560
You all know him?

59:37.560 --> 59:43.640
And Carol McElroy, our stepmom, Carol is here too to make sure he doesn't wander into traffic.

59:43.640 --> 59:47.080
That's always nice to have.

59:47.080 --> 59:49.480
Oh, thanks to Montaigne.

59:49.480 --> 59:53.560
Thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with You.

59:53.560 --> 59:56.840
Thank you to Matt.

59:56.840 --> 59:57.840
Oh, sorry.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.080
Listen, if we don't get them out of here in the next minute, they're going to knock it

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080
to Olive Garden.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080
Thank you, that's going to do it.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080
Yeah.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.960
So Griff, just real quick, just a quick, real quick impression of Grandpa Dan ordering a

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.080
naked chicken chalupa at Taco Bell.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.080
Easy.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.240
Can I have a naked, chomping, cheeky, chubo?

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.240
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.240
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:44.360
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:59.680
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.
