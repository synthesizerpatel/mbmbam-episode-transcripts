If you change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown in Jason Derulo, take a chance on me

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

01:04.000 --> 01:32.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

02:04.000 --> 02:14.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

02:34.000 --> 02:44.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

03:04.000 --> 03:14.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

03:14.000 --> 03:24.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

03:24.000 --> 03:34.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

03:34.000 --> 03:44.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

04:04.000 --> 04:14.000
I made her mine, a bounty of flesh

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
I will poke holes in the top

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
I'll put a twig in there, some leaves, don't even worry about it

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
As far as the signs you're looking for

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
Sugar water

04:58.000 --> 05:08.000
Who is the founder of acting?

05:08.000 --> 05:18.000
I would really like to know who is the founder of acting

05:18.000 --> 05:28.000
I would really like to know who is the founder of acting

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
A poet named Thespis in 534 BC became the first person to play a part on stage.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
Jim Barney revolutionized it though. He perfected it.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
It's like how the Chinese may have invented fireworks, but I guess the Chinese perfected fireworks too.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
We perfected blowing our hands off.

06:12.000 --> 06:24.000
This one also comes from FormSpring. Hey guys, just wondering what the word cute means. I hear women use the word in conversation all the time and I am more and more confused about its true meaning given its multitude of uses.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
It means chubby. Sorry son.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Chubby, but you got a great personality on you.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
Just substitute cute with non-threatening and that's exactly what it means. He's so cute means he's so non-threatening.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
And by non-threatening it means you don't know what she means when she says cute. That's non-threatening for you.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
That's the definition of non-threatening. Hey, I got a little piece of advice for you, Prom King.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
Next time you're around someone who says cute, flip a table. Just flip a table. See if they keep calling you cute.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
Was that adorable? Was that so so cute? And then just make love to them right there.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
They will not fight.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Flip the table back over. And if they do fight, just make them yours.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
They won't do you. They're your property.

07:23.000 --> 07:31.000
So Adam has a problem. Adam wrote to us from Gmail. He says, my friend doesn't seem to fully grasp the point of the Would You Rather game.

07:31.000 --> 07:39.000
He poses questions such as, would you rather be able to leap over tall buildings or have the ability to hear babies crying anywhere?

07:39.000 --> 07:54.000
OK, let me just take a tea right here. A big tea sack right here and say, that's a terrible power. Anywhere a newborn is distressed.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Do you know what your days would be like? Just constantly from dusk till dawn, wake up to slumber.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Not ever sleep. Sound of millions of babies crying.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Keep reading the question because I like the second one better.

08:10.000 --> 08:18.000
Or would you rather be on fire or not be on fire?

08:18.000 --> 08:27.000
I want to read this guy. How can I teach him the proper way to play or is he a lost cause?

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Adam, I think, man, I think you got to jettison that one into the sun.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah, maybe he's just not allowed to play that game anymore. Maybe not that game.

08:37.000 --> 08:49.000
Maybe another one. Maybe he's really good at checkers. Be able to breathe underwater or have Lyme disease.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Would you rather win the lottery or be raped by a gorilla?

08:54.000 --> 09:05.000
Would you rather find a crisp, clean one hundred dollar bill or watch an elderly loved one be pushed on a flight of stairs?

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
It is up to you. The choice, my friend, is yours. One for the ages, a puzzler for ages.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
Would you rather have a credit card that you never had to pay back?

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
OK, sounds good so far. Or no teeth or no teeth.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Well, can I have both or just just the one one or the other or the other?

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
I guess I could get those those middle teeth like the guy from James Bond.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
There you go. I can't I can't decide. I can't decide.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
It's a toughie. This this one comes from Socrates via Gmail.

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
He says, So I was planning on getting a tattoo on my shoulder, but I'm starting to notice that everyone has one there.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
I have this thing about trying to be unique. So could you tell me another spot I could get inked?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
I have one on my right elbow if that matters.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Your sack. Travis says sack. Travis has a good sack.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
But Travis Travis is Travis has attacked. I was going to make a joke.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
None of us have tattoos on our shoulders, but you've got no I have a tattoo on my shoulder blade.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
I don't have one on like my actual shoulder. I have one on my scapula.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Thanks, Bones. But not on my actual like shoulder.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Did you just thank your bones? No, I think the show the show bones.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
No, you're not going to turn another Mamba Bam. You're not going to turn another Mamba into a Bones fan cast.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
That's fair. Borey honest circle jerk. I don't know.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
He's so dreamy. But I actually have four right now. Justin, you got two. Griffin, you got one.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Mm hmm. As far as placement goes, dude, everyone's got tattoos everywhere.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
You want to be original. Don't get one. Yeah, you're not going to come up with a place like, well, what's original inside the lip.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah, everyone's got that behind your ear. Everyone's got that back your neck. Everyone's got that.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Go eyelid. Get with that. That girl in Indiana Jones. Oh, yeah.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Has that written on our eyelids. Do that. I don't think that's I don't think that's a tattoo, though.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
Culturally. Oh, shit. It's not a tattoo, Griffin. It seemed like kind of a she had a crush on her teacher.

11:10.000 --> 11:18.000
And so she wrote it. Oh, is that fine? You know, I thought you had to start listening to the band tattoo.

11:18.000 --> 11:26.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, I always wanted to get a a tattoo of tattoo from Fantasy Island.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
And yeah, lifting up his shirt and he would have a tattoo of the band tattoo.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
So there you go. Get that. Get that. Well, I'll give you one hundred dollars.

11:36.000 --> 11:44.000
That's I'll give you one hundred dollars. I think we could probably get you a guest spot on the show if you if you get a tattoo tattoo tattoo.

11:44.000 --> 11:54.000
I have I've had several people ask about guest spots doing a guest spot on the show, and I don't think they understand the premise of the show.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
My brother, my brother and me and Dave Coulier.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
My brother, my brother and me and the cast of Hairspray.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
I know. Well, just just three of us actually. It's kind of a thing that we do.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
It's the deal. Also, what this show needs more of is over talk.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
I think I think we could all use for a little bit more. Everyone talking at once.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
This next question comes from Evan versus Gmail.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
You guys remember when Evan fought Gmail, that one thought was totally awesome.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
Evan says, I, like many, belong to a group of friends. One of the friends in this group found a guy and started dating him.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
They're currently living together. No one else in the group likes this guy, but now he's always around wherever whenever she is.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
And he doesn't have any other friends either. So we're expected to spend his birthday with him.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
The group has asked me specifically to not be mean to him because she is the other friend's boyfriend and we don't want to push her out of the group.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Evan didn't actually ask a question here. Evan just told us that neat little anecdote.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
That's a great story, Evan. Yeah, I like the part about the birthday.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
Do you remember that one scene where he doesn't have any other friends and they're expected to spend his birthday with him?

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah, that's pretty good. Evan, Evan, you didn't ask for advice, but let me give you some.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Just be cool. Just be cool, dog. Just be cool, man.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
Everyone at some point, I think, has to deal with this, right? Yeah, it'll shake out eventually, though.

13:20.000 --> 13:28.000
Like that seems to be the way. I mean, either he'll realize he's not welcome and peel off or, you know, you guys will get to know him.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
But that's a tough... It could be that your group of friends is super tight-knit, right?

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
And maybe it's not that this guy sucks. It's that you're not willing to let new people in.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
Or maybe he's super shy, which just adds to the situation. So I think you should maybe give the guy, you know, a second chance.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Maybe try and get to know him. He's not so bad.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
Now, here's the thing. Counterpoint to that. If he's a real douche, like if he's just not interesting, that's one thing.

13:53.000 --> 14:03.000
But if he, like, is being a jerk and, you know, is mean to this friend and you guys, like, specifically actually don't like him, that's another thing.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
And that's worthy of you being mean right back. Don't you take his guff.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, no. I'm behind you, Evan. Don't set it off. Don't set it off because that's going to be on you.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
That's on you, then. And that's my fault. I'm sorry, guys.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah, well, you don't have to live with the repercussions. It's okay, T-Bag. You just got a little...

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
T-Sack, sorry. T-Sack, you just got a little aggravated. T-Sack out.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
We have a strict anti-insta-hating policy, NBNBAM, and I would appreciate it if you'd respect that.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
Respect. Open question from Yahoo Answers user DeepThinkingWhatTheFuckGirl.

14:39.000 --> 14:50.000
She says, Pol, would you sleep with a Navi if you could? Or Navi, sorry. Navi, one of the blue-skinned peeps from Avatar.

14:50.000 --> 14:59.000
Man, that's tough because who could... I mean, I'm assuming you would be in the world of the Avatar. Who could sleep with all that fucking glowing shit and natural beauty?

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Wouldn't you just want to get up and scamper? I wouldn't want to close my eyes.

15:02.000 --> 15:11.000
Who could close their eyes? I wouldn't blink. I would just drain... There's a glowing mosquito and it's three feet long. This is so much better than doing it.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Way better than doing it. Why would you waste your time?

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
What's a Navi? A Navi is like the big blue people. The big blue people with the hair.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
You didn't see Avatar?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
No, I didn't see Avatar.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
Congratulations. Oh, cool. I'm on the podcast with the two guys left on planet Earth who didn't see Avatar.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
I mean, it's not a good movie, so I mean, good on you.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Do you want to know why I didn't see it?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Tell me.

15:34.000 --> 15:45.000
Because of shit like this, one of the answers was from a guy named Warriors Pride whose avatar is an avatar or a Navi.

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
Oh, God. He says, Yes, I would sleep with myself. I sleep with a mirror.

15:51.000 --> 15:58.000
You can sleep with me if you want, but my tail does things involuntarily like go towards areas that make humans uncomfortable.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
It's a Navi thing.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Wait, let's get that last line again.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
My tail does things involuntarily like go towards areas that make humans uncomfortable.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It's a Navi thing.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
It's a Navi thing. You wouldn't understand.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
You wouldn't get it. A Navi understand the science of walnut pleasures.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
You wouldn't understand. Get that tail off my walnut.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
That's the most awkward thing, because I truly believe that that gentleman believes he's answering that question legitimately.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
You know, he's got like a giant bucket of blue paint and every morning he wakes up and just...

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
Griffin, your judgment has bothered me. It's a Navi thing, man.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
How could you get it? You couldn't get it?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
The reason I didn't see the movie isn't because I'm afraid I'd encounter people like this.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
What if I became one?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
What if you did?

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
You mean what if you got to live on a beautiful, beautiful forest planet and got to just fucking swing from trees all day?

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
Right, but the planet is in my mind because I actually live in butt shit Ohio.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
But it would be in my mind. I would be dancing.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
I would be, you know, tripping the light fantastic on planet giant blue aliens.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Hey, Griffin, did the next line of that answer was it?

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
Oh, sorry, I got to go. My attractive wife and kids just walked in the room.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Is that the next thing?

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
That's actually exactly. Yeah, that's how it ended.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
So here's a question from FormSpring.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
It's anonymous, as most FormSpring questions are.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
What is the best way to approach people who are almost your acquaintances, but not quite?

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
Like you've talked to them a couple of times, but you barely know their names.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Sadly, most of our relationships with people are like that. OK, good one.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I actually have a trick that I use.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Stand near them until they get upset.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Stand near them, creep your way in.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
No, work as a team. Get someone like a good friend or a girlfriend or a boyfriend or whatever.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
And tell that person ahead of time, listen, if I don't introduce you, it's because I've forgotten this person's name.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
And introduce yourself like I am being a bad friend, boyfriend, girlfriend to you.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Like, well, I'm Susan. What was your name?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
And it's like, oh, yeah, sorry.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
And then you can learn their name again.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't think he's asking or she is asking how how to remember people's names.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I think he's just saying he barely knows their names.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
He needs to take it to the next step.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
I like the idea of a friendship wingman, though.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Yeah, it works out really well.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
You know what I'm saying?

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Like a guy can be like, you can have a conversation with somebody near somebody that you don't know.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
But you're friends with your friendship wingman.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
And you can talk about something that you know that person's interested in.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And then suddenly the line becomes a triangle.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
You know what I'm saying? A friendship triangle.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Find out something that they're interested in.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Like you said that you barely know their names.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And that is a huge first step.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
If you address somebody by their name.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
Dale Carnegie says that everyone's favorite sound in the English language is the sound of their own name.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
As a stone fact.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Learn their name. Use it a lot.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
They're going to warm up to you pretty quickly.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
And then find out something they're interested in and ask them about it.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
If you don't know what they're interested in, use the environment that you're in.

19:23.000 --> 19:30.000
If you are at a party, at a show, at a concert, reference what is going on around you.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Ask if they're having a good time.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Jeffrey, how did you get to this concert, Jeffrey?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
What would you say, Jeffrey?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Jeffrey, what's your favorite Dave Matthews song, Jeffrey?

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Jeffrey, how do you enjoy being the butler for the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Jeffrey?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
I love Jeffrey Matthews Band.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
What did I do, Jeffrey?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I just put that in, Jeffrey.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Jeffrey, I didn't mean to say that, Jeffrey.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And then your best friends.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
And then your best friends. Just like that.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Say their name a lot and then the first time you meet them say,

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Hey, nice to meet you, Jeffrey. You want to go to a wine tasting with me, Jeffrey?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Jeffrey, let's look at houses.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Jeffrey, it'll be like that movie Sideways, Jeffrey.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Jeffrey, let's go to look at open houses, Jeffrey.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I bought us matching sweaters, Jeffrey.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Jeffrey, let's wear these matching sweaters, Jeffrey.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Let's go for a wine tasting in the country.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Jeffrey, hug me, Jeffrey.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Come to my villa for a weekend, Jeffrey.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Your villa?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
No, they rolled the double L's.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Come on, Jeffrey.

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
My Jeffrey and I recently discovered the website Chatroulette.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Now she's on it for several hours a day.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
I'm worried due to the high percentage of disgusting things and weird people on it.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Is this warranted?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Yep, she's looking at dicks.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Okay, not your dick though, Jeffrey.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Some strange dicks on the internet.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
Jeffrey, she's looking at dicks. I'm sorry.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
I don't know if you use Chatroulette. It's literally half dick.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
You can come up with whatever you want.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Oh, that dude's playing the guitar.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Oh, there's a dick.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Where did that dick come from?

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
The reason you get on Chatroulette is either to show your prong to strangers

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
or if you're in a large group of people and you've all had a few drinks

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
and so you're just scanning the internet on Chatroulette

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
hoping that you'll see a dick so you can all laugh at it.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
You're like, how crazy is this dick?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I didn't want to see that.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Check out that dick. What the fuck?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
It's so good that we all saw that dick together.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Jeffrey, get over here and look at this dick, Jeffrey.

21:37.000 --> 21:44.000
I think the bigger problem is that it's because of anomalies like herself

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
that there are guys showing off their wangs on Chatroulette.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
Every one out of 20, there's that one girl who's like, ah, dicks.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Also, dude, I want to point out, if your girlfriend's on Chatroulette

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
several hours a day, there's some reevaluating needs to go on there

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
because that's hours, dude. Hours.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Baby dinners? I made dinner tonight.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I'm on Chatroulette. Back off.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm looking at waiters.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
This red cabbage took me two hours to prepare and season correctly.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
This guy's been seasoning his sausage for three minutes now.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Maybe we're late for grandpa Pa's funeral.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I'm on Chatroulette.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Bang. Bang.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
Here's one from Yahoo Answers.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
I don't want any answers from us on it because it's kind of a creepy question,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
but I think the answers are better than the question itself.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
The question is, do you know any good songs to have sex to?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Kind of creepy, right?

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Here's some of the responses.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Let's get it on, Marvin Gaye. Sure.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Doin' It by LL Cool J.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Okay. A little on the nose for me.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
A Thousand Years by Sting.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Not familiar with the track, but if it's by Sting, then...

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I bet it's a long...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It's a thousand years.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Beat It by Michael Jackson.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Eminem, Superman.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Well... Okay.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Yeah, why not?

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
It's a little more circumspect.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Nelly, Hot in Here.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Well, okay, now the train's gone off the tracks.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
That's some weird bedroom activities, if you're listening to Hot in Here.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
That song's way too... It's got it too heavy a beat.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
50 Cent, In the Club.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Well... Maybe late till you get home.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Anything by Kid Rock, Nickelback, and Aerosmith.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Slow by Jamie Foxx.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Well, okay.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
The problem with that is...

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Nothin' on the Radio, Gettin' You Home. Why don't we just dance?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I don't know what that means.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Is it a lyric?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Ahh...

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screwed by Jimmy Buffett? Good one.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
No...

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
H on our Puffin' Stuff is Yahoo! Entertainment's name.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Son of a Sailor, that's a great one.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Cheeseburger in Paradise?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Yes.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Anything off Boats.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
His seminal 1981 album, Boats.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I'm actually...

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
You gotta pick one song. It's gotta be Amazing Grace, right?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Gotta be Amazing Grace.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
But only the first two verses.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
We've got an anonymous question from a Form Spring user.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
I'm a software developer at a local semiconductor company.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
The pay and benefits are awesome, but the job isn't challenging.

24:59.000 --> 25:07.000
Should I look for a more interesting job or stay and keep making a lot of money but be really bored?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
What are you shitting me?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Where's that money, dawg?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Dude, the pay and benefits are awesome.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Get that money.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Get that money and then you can spend that.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Do you want challenge? Do a Sudoku.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
What's wrong with you?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Have you seen the way the economy is now?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Just keep that money and get it.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Get that money till you're rich.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Yeah, dude.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Don't make that green.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Do it with one hand tied behind your back.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Also, I just want to throw out right here.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
You work with stuff called semiconductors.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
That's awesome.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Maybe pay attention. It sounds dangerous.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
Swap the answer to gravity field for an EMP pulse generator.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
If I flip the wrong switch, I destroy reality.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
No problem.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Pretty boring.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
We're just trying to recreate the power of a star on Earth.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
We're just trying to find the God element.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
It's not challenging.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Pass me that Sudoku, Jeffrey.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Did you read today's Dilbert?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Oh, man.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
God, in this machine, this tube, this supercollider.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
But this Dilbert's really good.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I think...

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Supercollider or semiconductor?

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
A semiconductor is a common part used in a supercollider.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
It's what shoots the two things that collide into each other.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
I took one semester of...

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Well, it was geography.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It was my integrated science class.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
But you minored in semiconductor, right?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
That is true.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
No, sociology. They sound similar.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
That was it. My bad.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
But they are not.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
What is the best way to get past the friend zone with a lady friend?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Can't be done.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Gotta move in faster. Not at all.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
Once you're in the friend zone, you don't ever get out.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Unless...

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Unless...

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
You're in the friend zone because they're dating one of your friends.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Mmm.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
I'm not condoning that kind of activity.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Unless...

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Unless you are.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Unless you feel that call.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
You feel that call of chemistry.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
She'd be better with you than him.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
Yeah, he's always in there listening to Jamie Foxx songs.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Are they trying to knock boots?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
You'd play Do It It by LL Cool J, something proper.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Something smooth like Amazing Grace.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
You know, it's funny to me. We keep getting questions like,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
how do I move out of the friend zone?

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
How do I know when someone actually wants a relationship with me?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
You know the question is, my brother and me doesn't get a lot.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Like, I'm in a relationship with several women.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
How do I terminate one of them and just get some more friends?

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
I just have women calling me every day, and I am sick of it.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
But my answer to all of these questions is, for some reason,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I don't think there's a secret code.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
And there's body language to look for.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
And there's certain combinations of words to look for.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Just ask them.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Just grow a pair and be like, hey, listen, I dig you.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
What is this?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
And then don't let that change your friendship.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
Or if it does, then you need to make the decision which is more important.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
I think this is such a modern thought.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
I think you should just, like Travis said, just caveman it up.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Give me date. Be good.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Let's do this.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Because they want it too.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Nobody wants to be friends with a person.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
And I understand the fear that comes from, like, I don't want to push this.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I get it, but here's the thing.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
And this is kind of a different way of looking at it.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Maybe it'll help you.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
If you're thinking this way, you're not in the friend zone.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Okay? She is. You're not.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
You're not in the friend zone.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
And the reason that you're, like, if you're friends with somebody,

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
a lot of times, being friends with somebody of the opposite sex,

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
and I know everybody's done this, so they can't act like they can't, they don't,

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
but I've been friends with somebody of the opposite sex

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
who I think maybe kind of digs me because it makes me feel good about myself.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Everyone's done it.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Please don't think I'm a bad person.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Everybody does it.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
And I've been on the receiving end of that too.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
If that's not working out for you,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
if that connection isn't getting it done for you,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
you need to just pony up because, like, at this point,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
the point you're at now psychologically,

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
you can't worry about losing the friendship because psychologically,

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
you already have because you're out of the friend zone.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
You are past the friend zone. You're not there anymore.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
And the thing is, don't fool yourself into thinking they don't know that you dig them.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Right.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
People are very smart and pick up on stuff like that every day.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
They know that you do.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
You know, maybe you touch their shoulder a little bit too long

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
or you've been complimenting them more than you have in the past,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
but people pick up on that dude.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
So she probably knows that,

29:55.000 --> 30:03.000
and her failure to reciprocate back tells you you're not gonna move out of that.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Or just ask, if it doesn't pan out, bail.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
I mean, bail on, not bail on the friendship, bail on worrying about it as a relationship.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Or you will ruin the friendship.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
Yeah. Let me call back to an answer we frequently give out to queries like this,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
which is, just get more attractive.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Just be more attractive.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Maybe go do some pull-ups.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Maybe do some pull-ups, work your core.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Just work that core, blast it.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Blast your core out, pump up on some peck juice,

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
and then I'm guessing it's gonna be so much easier to get past the friend zone.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
It's gonna be a lot easier.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
It's gonna be hard for her to stay in the friend zone when she's in the bone zone.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Am I right, Nellis?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
My man Matt, he writes to us from Gmail.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
He says he's currently looking for a new job.

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
What are some excuses he could use to leave his current job early to go on interviews?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
If he goes to any more doctor's appointments,

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
they're going to think something seriously is wrong with me.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
You're all at just appointments.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Yeah.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
That's a kind of doctor.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Okay, that's true.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
He's panning appointments.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
It's alright, T-Sach.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
He just got a little really aggressive.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Oh man, that's a good question.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
How many interviews are you going on that are panned out that this is a problem?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
You may just want to stick with that job.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Maybe just keep that job.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
Maybe you are not suited for other jobs.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
Let's give him some serious real help because we're three creative types.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
We can come up.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I'm working on something in my mind.

31:36.000 --> 31:44.000
I haven't fully developed it, but it involves psychic powers.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
Maybe say you have psychic powers and you sense that there's going to be a horrible catastrophe,

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
but really sell it so that everyone else actually thinks you could get the whole office to leave.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Then when you come in the next morning, be like, it wasn't today.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
It wasn't yesterday, but it's definitely coming soon.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I feel it in my bones.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
It may be time for lupus.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Maybe time for lupus.

32:10.000 --> 32:17.000
I don't like to break glass in case of emergency on lupus too often, but maybe time to fake lupus.

32:17.000 --> 32:25.000
He says that, he means that very, very literally because Justin has a vial of lupus that he keeps nearby

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
in case he needs to be sick for a long, long time.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I will give you this caution, Matt.

32:31.000 --> 32:39.000
If any of those businesses or places that you're going to interview for call your current employer for a reference

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
or anything like that, you're effed, dude.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Yeah.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
House of cards just comes tumbling down.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Yeah.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Watch out for that.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
How would you describe Matt as a worker?

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
Well, he was a great worker, but his productivity slowed down pretty significantly when he got that lupus.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
What?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
When he got that what?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
I'm sorry.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
What did he say?

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
The lupus that he has.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
That he definitely, definitely has that no one would lie about.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
He definitely had that lupus.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I saw his wheelchair.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
He's messed up with the lupus.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
The doctor's for sure of it.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
I definitely have breast cancer.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
They're curing that every day.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, so maybe don't lie.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Wesley.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
He says, recently my wife and I wanted another dog.

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
I wanted to adopt an older dog like we had before, but she wanted a puppy, so we got a puppy.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Well, there it is, right?

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
Now she complains about the work involved with the puppy and complains about the puppy peeing in the house.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
Is it appropriate to say, I told you so, or should I remain quiet when she complains?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Oh, dude, that fixes nothing.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Yeah, don't.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Don't play the I told you so game, man.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
It fixes nothing.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
They know.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Trust me.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Don't play that.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Oh, don't do it.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I can't give you a strong enough recommendation.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Don't do that.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
I can give you some real world puppy advice.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Travis, professional dog trainer.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
You've wandered right, right into his right.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
The question between an older dog and a puppy, there are benefits to both.

34:04.000 --> 34:12.000
The benefit of getting a puppy versus an older dog is it is easier to train on a puppy the way that you want it to be where older dogs,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
any behavior problems or more ingrained and harder to train out.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
And it won't die as quickly.

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
Older dogs usually come more docile and with less house training problems.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
But a puppy is going to grow out of that in like four months.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
It's not going to be a problem anymore.

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
And now you have this puppy that you can train to be the kind of dog you want fresh, easier.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
You know, I'm just full of vitality and life.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
You know, my problem with old dogs is not Martin Lawrence.

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
I really thought his character was underdeveloped.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
No, that's wild hogs, you liar.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
What you're thinking of the wrong old hogs.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Wait, wild hogs.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
What is it?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
I did. I choked.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
You're right.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Old dogs is a.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Old dogs is Robin Williams.

35:01.000 --> 35:07.000
Robin Williams and so Scientologist named his son.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
He named his son after an airplane.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
By extension, it did not have Martin Lawrence.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Yes.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
No, that's true.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
What Justin said was completely accurate.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
OK.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Also, I'm sorry for making fun of Jethro Volta.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
He's passed and that was that was beneath me.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
That's true.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
So Andrew from Gmail asks.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
You're going to read questions?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
And now he.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Yeah, I know. It's weird, right?

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
What are some ways to help build motivation for things like studying and working on personal projects?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I didn't like that.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I wish you would do that in the future.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Damn it.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
I wish you would leave it to me and Justin.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I just I got caught up in the moment.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Right, right.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
I get it.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
I get how it happens.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
It's just immediately uncomfortable.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
That was my bad.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
Listen, that's all on TSAC.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
That's how TSAC does, though.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
That's how I roll.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
You know what, Andrew?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Go take a shower.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Oh, yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Go take a shower.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
I've been I've been making myself shower.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
I'm actually 13 minutes past two for my shower.

36:07.000 --> 36:23.000
I've been doing my noon shower and like I'll work and I'll write a bit in the morning and then like I'll feel my energy start to start to be sapped from me by some unseen force and I'll just go hop in the shower and then I get it's like the second cup of coffee.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
You know what I'm saying?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yeah.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Oh, also coffee.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Lots and lots of coffee.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
That helps.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
But mostly just showers because showers are great because they also keep you clean.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
I also like to operate in a clean environment.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
That being said, I usually don't get a lot of stuff done.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Bullshit, sir.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
That's why I don't get anything done.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
People are like, why didn't you get anything done?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Because I didn't clean my room.

36:44.000 --> 36:50.000
I didn't get anything done because there's a four month old bowl of salsa sitting right next to my computer mouse.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
It's sitting right there.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Are you talking about me, sir, or are you talking about yourself?

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Oh, we don't want to have this fight, do we?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah, we're not doing this, guys.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
Kyle writes in, he says, I have a problem with taking girls, talking to girls, taking girls.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
He has a problem with making them his.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Making them mine.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I have a problem with talking to girls that I'm interested in.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
I keep putting in jars and I don't know what to do about it.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I have a problem with talking to girls that I'm interested in.

37:13.000 --> 37:21.000
I can never gather up enough courage to ask them out, which leads me to worry about it and develop anxiety attacks.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
I don't have a problem with talking to ladies in committed relationships or females that I'm not interested in.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
I'll help me out, please.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Kyle, dude, you're psyching yourself out.

37:31.000 --> 37:39.000
You know that thing you hear where it's like once you get married, you know, that's when girls all find you attractive?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
It's not being married.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
It's not giving a shit.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Yeah, it's that confidence.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
I say you start dating girls you're not interested in.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Okay.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
If you have no problem with talking to them, go with that.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Yeah, that's a great idea.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
That's a great life plan.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Nothing bad could come of that.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Yeah.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
That explains so much, Travis.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Sorry, tea sack.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Tea sack.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
That's tea sack.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
That's not Travis.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Let's separate.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Kyle, as far as that goes, Justin's right.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
You're psyching yourself out.

38:11.000 --> 38:17.000
You're just getting yourself down, dude, and just talk to them like you're not interested in them.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Go take a shower and then just caveman it up.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
I'm telling you.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
I'm telling you.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
That's not a joke.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
If I'm at a bar and I'm too nervous to talk to a girl, I just flip the caveman switch.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
It's like, hey, you look nice.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
You buy a drink.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
We dance now.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
We dance now to the flamenco music.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Okay.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
First off, maybe you're not going to flamenco bars.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
That's the place to go to meet ladies.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Oh, my God.

38:41.000 --> 38:47.000
You would not believe how successful I've been strip mining at flamenco bars for ladies.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
Kyle, you have to tell yourself this is a mental block.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
The problem with this is solely on you.

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
If you start thinking to yourself, you know how it's easier for you to talk to girls in a committed relationship, right?

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
Start telling yourself in your head that you are in a committed relationship, that no matter what you do,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
you don't want to meet a girl to go out with.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
You want to meet a girl to just say hi, just to talk to a girl at a bar.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Because I know that thing.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
When you're single, you turn to like the Terminator, right?

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
You got the hood, and every girl you look at is like, you know, isn't into me.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I don't like her coat.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
You know, you're analyzing every girl, and you just got to let that go.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
It's a mental block.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Let it go.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Just go talk to her.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
She's not always going to be wearing that coat.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
She might get a new coat.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
She might get a new coat.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Just pretend.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
A real nice seersucker.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Tell yourself.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Seersucker?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Seersucker?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
What?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Yeah, seersucker.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Tell yourself you're in a committed relationship.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
Pretend that you're in a committed relationship, and just go for it.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
Because what you're trying to do is get someone who doesn't know you at all to accept you

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
in a few minutes.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
And that's not going to get you anywhere.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Just go talk to people to be talking to them.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
And if that doesn't help, prostitution.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
A lot of law enforcement turns a blind eye these days.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Hugh Grant's doing it.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
He's down.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
What's up?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Not a good enough for you?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
A Hugh Grant.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
That was a big shot.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
What?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Well, isn't there anybody more relevant?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Hasn't Charlie Sheen probably been busted for that?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Yeah.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I think he's done that pretty recently.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Jordan from Gmail.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
When is the right time to move out?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
He's 20 years old now.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm going to assume it's a he.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
21 on the Monday this podcast comes out.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Happy birthday.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Happy birthday, Jordan.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
You did it, Jordan.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Yeah.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Boost it up, son.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Have one on me.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Boost it up.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Did you say boost it up?

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Send that receipt to Griffin.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
He will reimburse you with a perpetual check.

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
And attending college with a commute of one hour total a day to school.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
That sounds miserable.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
That's terrible.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
That's awful, dude.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Lastest podcast time, though.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Loyal customer.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
I hope to be done with school soon, but hope to be taking a follow-up online course that

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
will last around 18 months.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
If you can lay out some sort of timetable on when it's appropriate to depart the nest,

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
I'd be much obliged.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
I don't have much money right now, but I do live in Canada where hugs are currency.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Thanks in advance, Jordan.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Jordan, you're 20 years old now.

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
I'm going to say the timetable is two years ago.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.480
I'm not sure how you can make that happen, but if you can find some sort of...

41:26.480 --> 41:27.480
I will say this, Jordan.

41:27.480 --> 41:32.340
When living at home stops your life from developing, it's time to move out.

41:32.340 --> 41:36.200
So two years ago.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.200
I do want to...

41:37.200 --> 41:38.200
Okay.

41:38.200 --> 41:48.200
If you're someone who lives at home to this age to 20, maybe 21, perhaps 22, make sure

41:48.200 --> 41:54.980
you have some money together because if you can stay there and get together a nest egg,

41:54.980 --> 42:00.080
go do that and get together enough money that you're not going to be like dying or starving

42:00.080 --> 42:01.080
to death.

42:01.080 --> 42:07.120
But I know it's intimidating if you haven't done all the stuff.

42:07.120 --> 42:11.560
If you haven't signed the lease and looked for the apartment and done all that garbage,

42:11.560 --> 42:19.620
but it's really look around at you, look around at the stupid, awful people that you meet

42:19.620 --> 42:24.140
every day who you still love because that's what makes the world go round.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.400
But they're stupid and terrible.

42:26.400 --> 42:30.760
Remember that they have done all this stuff that you are intimidated by, assuming that

42:30.760 --> 42:31.760
you're intimidated by it.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.920
And that's kind of what it is because it's not that hard.

42:33.920 --> 42:38.280
Just make sure you have a steady income and specifically, though, doing the things like

42:38.280 --> 42:40.640
setting up your gas and crap like that.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.600
It's really not, not complicated.

42:42.600 --> 42:45.940
And the nice thing is once you start doing it, it's really empowering.

42:45.940 --> 42:49.780
It really does feel good to be like, I set up that electric account and it really is

42:49.780 --> 42:54.400
makes you feel like an adult, a great feeling.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.460
Just get out there and start trying it.

42:56.460 --> 43:02.080
Also it might help if you ask friends if anybody needed a roomie to kind of ease in that way.

43:02.080 --> 43:08.880
Who's already handling all this stuff or brothers, brothers.

43:08.880 --> 43:12.360
But as far as the timetable goes, don't rush yourself because you don't want to do it when

43:12.360 --> 43:14.880
you're not ready and you're not prepared and you don't have the money.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.960
But you know, there's no reason to wait.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.040
You're not really doing anything.

43:19.040 --> 43:20.040
Take the leap.

43:20.040 --> 43:21.040
Hey, did you ask?

43:21.040 --> 43:23.040
Did you ask Jeffrey if you needed a roommate?

43:23.040 --> 43:24.960
Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey.

43:24.960 --> 43:25.960
We should move in together.

43:25.960 --> 43:30.360
Jeffrey, we've just met Jeffrey, but it's a one bedroom apartment, but it's awfully

43:30.360 --> 43:34.960
spacious Jeffrey, Jeffrey, how do you feel about bunk beds, Jeffrey?

43:34.960 --> 43:36.440
I've got a California king bed.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.480
I promise we won't touch Jeffrey.

43:38.480 --> 43:45.600
Jeffrey, will you hold me during the thunderstorms, Jeffrey, it's hailing, Jeffrey, the black

43:45.600 --> 43:49.400
clouds are rolling in Jeffrey, Jeffrey, let us buy a puppy together.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.400
Jeffrey Jeffrey.

43:50.400 --> 43:51.400
We'll name him Jeffrey.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.400
Jeffrey.

43:52.400 --> 43:57.800
Let's go shopping at the local market.

43:57.800 --> 44:03.200
Jeffrey to draw Jeffrey.

44:03.200 --> 44:08.480
So I've got my final question loaded up on Yahoo! and it's been about 40 minutes.

44:08.480 --> 44:13.320
So let's so let's tell how nice people can can get ahold of us.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.880
Can I just say can we just say thank you to everybody?

44:15.880 --> 44:16.880
Thank you.

44:16.880 --> 44:20.880
We've had 10,000 downloads this week, 10k downloads this week.

44:20.880 --> 44:21.880
The show's blowing up.

44:21.880 --> 44:23.440
Everybody loves it.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.440
Do me a favor.

44:24.440 --> 44:28.240
Listen, I'm just I'm just saying nonsense.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.920
Not everybody loves it, though, because a lot of people aren't listening.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.120
If you can believe that they're missing out on this.

44:33.120 --> 44:34.880
How many people are on the planet right now?

44:34.880 --> 44:35.880
Too many.

44:35.880 --> 44:36.880
Don't keep your eyes.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.720
Don't keep your eyes under a bushel.

44:38.720 --> 44:41.060
Just you know what you can do?

44:41.060 --> 44:42.360
You can burn it on a CD.

44:42.360 --> 44:43.360
It's a short show.

44:43.360 --> 44:48.460
You can burn maybe two episodes on a CD disk, have a little listening party, whatever.

44:48.460 --> 44:49.460
This is great.

44:49.460 --> 44:52.740
And then you can talk about your favorite parts and you can give each other advice.

44:52.740 --> 44:57.320
That's what I want to I want to start up like I want us to start like a pay it forward style

44:57.320 --> 45:03.920
like right social movement where we change like a cult, like cult cult, but do please

45:03.920 --> 45:04.920
tell a friend.

45:04.920 --> 45:07.440
Tell somebody just just right now don't think about it.

45:07.440 --> 45:08.440

temple you need to make you laugh.

45:39.960 --> 45:42.120

45:42.120 --> 45:43.120
I don't know.

45:43.120 --> 45:44.120
It's going to be hard.

45:44.120 --> 45:49.800

my brother and me.

47:09.800 --> 47:31.080
You will never know me.

47:31.080 --> 47:48.600
I was lying in bed and my mom turned out the light it was about 10 p.m. and as the light

47:48.600 --> 47:53.520
was turned out I thought I heard someone speak and say oh about 30 minutes later my belly

47:53.520 --> 47:54.520
felt warm.

47:54.520 --> 47:59.240
I looked under the duvet and saw a little light coming from my belly button on closer

47:59.240 --> 48:03.640
inspection I thought I saw something fly out and leave my duvet I pushed my belly button

48:03.640 --> 48:04.980
and a bit of smoke came out.

48:04.980 --> 48:06.280
What the fuck just happened.

This was not a dream and has left me utterly confused.
