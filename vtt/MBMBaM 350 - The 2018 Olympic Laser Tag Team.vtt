00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.800
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

00:46.800 --> 00:52.000
and Me, an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.280
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.960
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:58.960 --> 01:06.320
Uh, wow folks, uh, big exciting news from Holly Weird, um, big thinker, big Hollywood thinker,

01:07.120 --> 01:12.400
uh, much like the James Cameron of our generation. Travis P. McElroy is here

01:12.400 --> 01:17.920
to speak with us. Uh, he told us that he had a new movie idea that he wanted to run past us.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.840
It's been a while. Love hearing these big movie ideas because I always know what blockbusters to

01:23.840 --> 01:28.480
look forward to in the following fiscal year. Now listen, here's the thing I want to let you

01:28.480 --> 01:34.320
all know. Up front, this is going to take a lot of capital to get made. This is not going to-

01:34.320 --> 01:35.360
Oh shit.

01:35.360 --> 01:39.200
It's going to be more expensive than Avatar, but I think when you hear it-

01:39.200 --> 01:41.360
How much did, how much was an avat- how much did,

01:41.360 --> 01:43.680
if I wanted to do an Avatar, how much would that run me?

01:43.680 --> 01:46.080
I think it was a hundred thousand dollars Canadian.

01:46.080 --> 01:46.800
Damn.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.520
I'm not sure, but I think that's like a hundred billion American. I'm not sure what the,

01:51.520 --> 01:56.080
what the exchange rate is, but listen to this. It popped in my head this morning

01:56.080 --> 02:02.320
and it, it was like I woke up with a start and I thought, why hasn't there been

02:03.200 --> 02:07.040
a Fast and the Furious Transformers crossover movie?

02:07.040 --> 02:09.360
Oh my God, Travis, this is a bad idea.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.160
Travis, you doofus, that's a great idea.

02:12.160 --> 02:17.120
Thank you, Justin. Thank you for getting on board with an amazing movie. How is that a terrible

02:17.120 --> 02:21.040
idea, Griffin? What do people love? They love giant robots that turn into cars. What do they

02:21.040 --> 02:25.360
love? They love the Fast and the Furious family gang that drives cars real fast. What's that you

02:25.360 --> 02:28.560
say? The robots turn into cars and then the Fast and the Furious people can drive those

02:28.560 --> 02:30.320
robots real fast? Fuck yes.

02:31.040 --> 02:35.680
Are you telling me you don't want to see Vin Diesel in a fucking exoskeleton

02:36.400 --> 02:40.480
that transformed out of a Harley into an exoskeleton for him to fight

02:41.280 --> 02:42.880
bad Optimus Prime? Are you kidding me?

02:42.880 --> 02:48.880
First of all, uh, uh, Vin- Toretto, Vinnie Toret- no, what's his fucking name?

02:48.880 --> 02:49.760
Dominic Toretto.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.600
Dominic- Dominic Toretto would never ride a motorcycle. He looks at one of those and he says,

02:53.600 --> 02:58.160
well, that's half a car. And so he doesn't, he doesn't do it. And I think it's because he's

02:58.160 --> 03:03.200
actually afraid of motorcycles, but he's like way too proud about it. But the other thing is if

03:03.200 --> 03:08.720
you're in the cockpit of a car, when it transforms into a transformer, you'll be liquefied. And I

03:08.720 --> 03:14.640
don't want to watch all my fucking good friends get liquefied like Tokyo Drift Boy and Dominic

03:14.640 --> 03:15.520
Toretto.

03:15.520 --> 03:21.520
That is a myth. You actually enter their brain like in Pacific Rim and suddenly you're piloting

03:21.520 --> 03:27.920
that Jaeger, son. You're, you are like synced. It's you and Optimus Prime doing battle against

03:28.800 --> 03:36.720
whoever the bad guy would be. Uh, I don't know. Maybe, uh, who I, who's Clive Owen. Maybe Clive

03:36.720 --> 03:41.120
Owen's the bad guy in this one. You know, and he's, he and Optimus, not Optimus Prime. Who's

03:41.120 --> 03:43.120
the bad one? Who's the bad one?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.160
Uh, bad Optimus-

03:44.160 --> 03:44.880
Megatron.

03:44.880 --> 03:45.360
Yeah.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.000
Megatron.

03:46.000 --> 03:46.560
Megatron.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.080
Megatron.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.640
Megaduck. He's fighting Megaduck and-

03:50.640 --> 03:55.520
Here's the other issue is that Vin Diesel refuses to be in any movie where there is an object

03:55.520 --> 04:00.080
larger than him in it. So like from a sense of scale perspective, it's going to be tough

04:00.080 --> 04:04.960
to get these big robots fighting around while Vin Diesel is also on the screen.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.720
You'll have to make Vin Diesel bigger then.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.960
I guess so, but then that's anticlimactic because then he can just knock the other bad

04:10.960 --> 04:11.760
robots over.

04:12.320 --> 04:20.000
Let me hit you with this. Transformers meets Fast and the Furious meets the Before Sun

04:20.000 --> 04:21.120
Rise franchise.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.000
Now, okay, well hold on.

04:24.000 --> 04:32.720
What I'm seeing here is you would have Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke just sort of having

04:32.720 --> 04:41.760
coffee and intense conversations as like just a cutaway, basically. Just like a cut to a

04:41.760 --> 04:46.160
building's being destroyed, panned down. I can't believe they're still going at it. Yeah,

04:46.160 --> 04:49.520
me neither. Anyway, Sunrise is just a few hours away.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.880
We better hurry.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.440
Okay, wait, Justin.

04:54.320 --> 05:00.880
Also, if the Autobots don't stop the Decepticons before Sunrise, Earth will end. So it's like

05:00.880 --> 05:05.920
very much like that's how you... They're sort of like our time keepers for the film.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.200
Baby, you are going to miss that plane. And then Domic Toretto's like,

05:09.200 --> 05:12.800
not on my watch. And he grabs Ethan Hawke and he gets into the airport and he doesn't

05:12.800 --> 05:16.480
miss the plane. And then the robot punches the airplane out of the sky.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.200
Fuck, this is really good actually now that I think about it.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.160
Justin, you've inspired me. How about this? All right.

05:22.160 --> 05:22.800
Okay.

05:22.800 --> 05:29.120
Fast and the Furious meets Transformers meets Boyhood. You filmed the movie over 20 years.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.280
You get to watch the robots get bigger.

05:31.280 --> 05:31.780
Yes.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.480
I think I like the before Sunrise one better.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.200
Okay. What if we do all of them together?

05:40.000 --> 05:45.920
Okay, so Boyhood is in the before Sunrise movies. And it's like before Sunrise and

05:45.920 --> 05:51.040
then after Sunrise and then like for 12 more years after all of the Sunrises,

05:51.040 --> 05:55.200
many, many Sunrises. And boy, this boy is just getting bigger and he's getting surlier, isn't he?

05:55.200 --> 06:00.560
Yeah, this is actually great. So take that and sell it. Just give us some,

06:00.560 --> 06:05.200
I guess. Give us some of it. That sound about right? I'm not sure the technical...

06:05.200 --> 06:07.120
You'll know in your heart what the right amount is.

06:07.120 --> 06:07.600
Yeah.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.480
But for right now, let's really get into the advice. Let's get deep in and help people.

06:12.480 --> 06:16.800
We just had a huge turnout in the Max Fun Drive and everybody really came out for us.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.520
So now I think it's time for us to come out for them.

06:20.160 --> 06:26.160
I recently found out that my boyfriend who I've been living with for over a year has been hiding

06:26.160 --> 06:33.600
precious metals, silver, gold around the house. He acted very strange when I asked him about it.

06:33.600 --> 06:37.600
His reason being that they are investments and to not go looking for them.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.720
Should I be concerned?

06:40.720 --> 06:47.200
Am I dating a Ron Swanson or a treasure hoarding dragon? That's from fool's gold in Oklahoma City.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.760
So this is a unique...

06:53.760 --> 06:59.360
You found it, eh? I knew this day would come. Well, here's the secret.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.760
If you go hunting for my gold, I come hunting for you.

07:04.720 --> 07:09.280
This is definitely a Desolation of Greg situation.

07:09.280 --> 07:18.480
The only reason you do this is for a doomsday prepper, right?

07:18.480 --> 07:28.560
There is a school of thought that not just doomsday prepper, but if the economy tanks,

07:28.560 --> 07:33.200
gold will still be doing okay. It's a safe investment, some people think.

07:33.200 --> 07:38.560
I don't think they think it's safe to hide it around your house like a wears wall though.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.880
But I don't know exactly.

07:40.880 --> 07:47.760
I will say that as a kid who grew up reading a lot of like magical realism, you know,

07:47.760 --> 07:55.280
Indian in the cupboard, kind of like a bridge should tear biffy, your lions, your witches,

07:55.280 --> 08:02.080
and or wardrobes that like the idea I think about this now is like what if I like hid like,

08:02.080 --> 08:06.320
you know, hid gold coins somewhere like in a banister or something.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.120
And then when BB finds them in 10 years, she's like, what?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.960
And I'm like, huh? How'd that get there?

08:10.960 --> 08:13.200
And now it's like a magical mystery in our house.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.280
Maybe we have leprechauns in the house. I don't know.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.480
It's magical for her.

08:17.920 --> 08:18.800
Yeah, I don't know.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.280
Maybe maybe your boyfriend's doing that for you.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.240
He wants to have a little mystery in your relationship.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.120
You know what I mean?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.720
He's definitely not doing that.

08:26.720 --> 08:31.120
I want to get in front of Travis's bad point and say he's definitely not doing this to add

08:31.120 --> 08:32.720
mystery to your relationship.

08:32.720 --> 08:37.280
It is it is because one Oh, isn't he? Isn't he Griffin? Because it sounds like there's some

08:37.280 --> 08:42.240
mystery. Sounds like this question asker is left with some questions.

08:43.040 --> 08:46.480
Yeah, I mean, no, I think this was not intentional.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.160
I think it's a nice side effect. Don't get me wrong.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.400
I'm curious about this relationship.

08:50.400 --> 08:56.880
And also, in Oklahoma City, like you've just given me a map that I can use to triangulate

08:56.880 --> 09:03.520
and come come calling come fucking come come on a fucking Diablo run of your of your of

09:03.520 --> 09:06.080
your house and get those get all that sweet coins.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.120
Get all those gold bars.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.160
I'm not saying I would.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.640
Yeah, Griffin, you're right.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.920
This is like in Zelda when you walk out and you smash a jar and you're like,

09:13.920 --> 09:17.680
who hides their jewels in just like a jar in their barn?

09:17.680 --> 09:19.120
This person does.

09:19.120 --> 09:19.840
Greg does.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.720
Greg hides them there.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.000
Greg hides them there.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.680
That makes me think everybody in Zelda is just like prepping.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.560
Just like the Hylian economy is going to collapse.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.720
Our fucking king is a boat.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.000
I just like sell your gold to me.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.080
I'm on your radio, your fantasy radio.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.320
Why would what why would you why would you do this?

09:42.320 --> 09:45.840
I guess is the question I keep coming back to is why would you hide all your gold and

09:45.840 --> 09:46.320
silvers?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.920
I feel like just I do.

09:49.920 --> 09:54.640
I think it breaks down a little bit when you're like, I am going to be very safe and buy a

09:54.640 --> 09:55.760
bunch of gold and silver.

09:56.720 --> 10:04.480
I, however, am just going to kind of scatter them about the house like so many lost chapsticks

10:04.480 --> 10:08.560
and just hope that I can remember where all that all of them are if needed.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.160
I guess so.

10:10.160 --> 10:16.240
I think about this like it would be good for me to have like some bottles of water on hand.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.680
That's about as far as like my prep instincts go.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.200
And by which I mean, I still don't have the water.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.680
But I think like that might be nice to have on hand.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.280
You get some water at some point.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.600
Am I so far behind the curve?

10:30.160 --> 10:33.440
Is it good to have a much gold and many silver in your house?

10:33.440 --> 10:35.760
I guess the question and I'm trying to come around to this.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.200
Let me tell you.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.680
Let me tell you as somebody who for a long time hosted a proper podcast.

10:42.240 --> 10:42.480
No.

10:43.040 --> 10:43.360
OK.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.400
Because here's the thing in the immediate in the immediate like right after.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.120
Sure.

10:49.120 --> 10:54.080
But like if we're talking a long term apocalypse, gold and silver are going to devalue very,

10:54.080 --> 10:54.800
very quickly.

10:54.800 --> 11:01.840
Whereas like freeze dried food, yet rice is going to be worth its weight in gold.

11:01.840 --> 11:06.400
Like actually, I went I went around my boyfriend's house and there were many

11:06.400 --> 11:08.640
carrot seeds and potato seeds all over.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.200
I was very curious and excited about this.

11:13.200 --> 11:18.960
I mean, is my boyfriend a very bad farmer who doesn't understand how seeds do?

11:19.840 --> 11:25.040
It's better that than like a katana that he says he's going to get very good at at some point.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.400
Like this is my investment is I'm going to get good at katana.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.720
So people want to have me on their crew, I guess.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.760
I also will say I just had this thought the other day.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.680
I'm 33 and by many definitions an adult.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.360
I don't know how investments work.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.120
For all I know, this might be the safest form of investment.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.080
Oh, shit.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.120
Yeah, it's possible.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.320
It's very possible.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.680
Welcome to bad money.

11:49.680 --> 11:54.240
It's a new talk show that the three of us do and we don't know fucking anything.

11:54.240 --> 11:58.480
So maybe get many gold and lots of silver, but make sure you got a katana because you

11:58.480 --> 12:02.480
don't want one of those without the other because folks will know this house has much

12:02.480 --> 12:03.920
gold in it, but no katanas.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.120
Let's get them.

12:05.920 --> 12:06.240
Right.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.160
How about this yahoo?

12:08.160 --> 12:08.960
Can I give it to you?

12:09.680 --> 12:10.080
Hit me.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.960
Yahoo's got a yahoo's got another a new name again.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.520
You remember our good old taba jokes?

12:17.440 --> 12:18.640
Yeah, oath.

12:18.640 --> 12:19.680
It's called oath now.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.600
So it's a new it's a neat cult they're doing with Verizon.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.640
Yahoo decided let's get hey Verizon you up.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.600
It's me yahoo.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.520
Want to make a call with me?

12:29.520 --> 12:31.440
You can't quit, right?

12:31.440 --> 12:34.640
If you go in and you're like I'd like to resign.

12:34.640 --> 12:39.680
I got a better opportunity and they're like my boy Tim Armstrong's like you're you're

12:39.680 --> 12:41.440
a revoking your oath.

12:42.160 --> 12:46.880
You're you're denying your oath and then he just opens the door.

12:46.880 --> 12:47.840
Oathbreaker!

12:48.400 --> 12:50.080
We have an oathbreaker!

12:50.080 --> 12:52.800
Everybody looks up from their like grindstones.

12:54.240 --> 12:54.480
No!

12:56.080 --> 12:57.200
Oh this is an AOL.

12:57.200 --> 12:57.920
You forged the oath.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.760
AOL's doing this too, huh?

12:59.760 --> 13:02.400
Leave your ID card on the wedding stone.

13:04.480 --> 13:08.960
Just lay down on the onyx table and we'll get your severance package all sorted out.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.600
Leave your scabbard with Valerie.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.880
Um this oath was sent in by Drew Campbell.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.440
Thank you oathbreaker Drew Campbell.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.640
It's yahoo answers user.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.800
It's oath use oath oath taker.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.320
Earl the snort oaths.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.200
Who's on your laser tag team?

13:30.800 --> 13:31.840
Um that's it.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.520
There's no additional details.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.720
Are there any answers from folks?

13:34.720 --> 13:40.240
Uh oh the sickest says with the best answer five stars you.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.320
Which is fucking pretty solid right?

13:42.320 --> 13:46.880
Like if you're getting on oath to ask a oath about like who's on your laser tag team it

13:46.880 --> 13:51.760
makes me assume you are an enthusiast and therefore probably have some fucking skills

13:51.760 --> 13:52.800
out there on the cyber grid.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.040
Hey guys who's on your laser tag team?

13:58.640 --> 14:01.680
I'm tempted to give a lazy answer which is just like folks I'd like to meet.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.800
So like Barack Hussein Obama a lot of people forget that Hussein was important.

14:04.800 --> 14:09.040
Um would be a big one like just because it would be like an honor you know Joe Biden

14:09.040 --> 14:14.080
would be it would be an honor um but would they be the best at laser tag?

14:14.080 --> 14:19.520
Joe Biden would yes absolutely no question Joe Biden yeah he would be like listen I've

14:19.520 --> 14:23.680
always wanted to learn how to back flip and this is the moment I'm gonna do it right now.

14:24.400 --> 14:29.200
And then he does and then he does he just does it over a team.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.680
How many are we talking let's put a limit on this.

14:31.680 --> 14:36.160
I think five I think including you it's five so you'd have four additional members of let's

14:36.160 --> 14:40.640
all work together let's not do individual laser tag teams and we wouldn't we maybe we get five

14:40.640 --> 14:44.640
not including us because I don't I did it once I played laser tag once at a place here in Austin

14:44.640 --> 14:51.040
called Blazertag and um they make you get really really high before no um and they just put you

14:51.040 --> 14:56.400
in a sensible tweed coat and I was like siphon filtering all over the fucking place just like

14:56.400 --> 15:01.520
no scoping kids and then as I left the place I realized that I was in like a mild state of

15:01.520 --> 15:05.280
cardiac arrest because of all the running and diving and shooting I'd been doing and

15:05.280 --> 15:09.440
so I don't think I'm cut out for it. I hate it when kids don't get into it

15:09.440 --> 15:14.080
sometimes you're laser tagging with kids and they're like just run up to you and shoot you

15:14.080 --> 15:18.960
it's like where's the action where's the imagination I think that bothers me a lot.

15:18.960 --> 15:24.320
Uh assuming we're going to be playing against teens I would like to welcome to my team uh

15:24.320 --> 15:30.080
Ariana Grande and whoever's big on YouTube right now I don't actually know whoever's

15:30.080 --> 15:36.960
big on YouTube right now who's not also a secret mega racist yeah yeah whoever's whoever could do

15:36.960 --> 15:41.600
that for us. Ariana Grande is not secretly uber racist right she just licked that donut that one

15:41.600 --> 15:49.280
time I mean I think that's if she was secret we wouldn't know until it's too late until she's like

15:49.280 --> 15:54.960
you're you're playing laser tag and she's like take this is for my superior race

15:54.960 --> 16:01.360
Ariana no no no get it you're off the team you're at a party and you're like bang bang into the

16:01.360 --> 16:05.440
and somebody's like no no no no no no no no no no no we don't we don't do that anymore we don't

16:05.440 --> 16:11.200
bang bang into the room anymore um that would be a sick song to laser tag to though that would be

16:11.200 --> 16:18.320
great let me pitch this name Keanu Reeves yes yes yes yes yes Travis wins the contest that

16:18.320 --> 16:24.400
fucking dude if you've seen like his um like videos of him like training and like running

16:24.400 --> 16:30.560
those gun obstacle courses training for John Wick it's like the dude's got it he's a fucking got it

16:30.560 --> 16:36.000
I absolutely must have him on the team except wait I'm gonna wait hold on I'm going to contradict

16:36.000 --> 16:40.640
myself because now I'm worried he's gonna make everybody else on the team look really bad like

16:40.640 --> 16:47.760
it'll be like wow we had you know 20 confirmed hits yeah 18 of them were John Wick's like between

16:47.760 --> 16:52.560
the other four of us we hit two people because everyone we came across was already zapped out

16:53.200 --> 17:02.320
yeah another problem is that he also um executes a lot of what Solid Snake calls uh CQC and so I

17:02.320 --> 17:07.520
think that if you strike if you strike someone in the laser tag field of battle you are asked to

17:07.520 --> 17:12.800
leave the Billy Bob's Wonderland yeah so that may be an issue but it's too good to back out from

17:12.800 --> 17:18.960
because I know I I saw that video and I thought Keanu Reeves may very well be the coolest living

17:18.960 --> 17:25.120
human right now uh which I I yeah I don't think you can dull those instincts his instinct is to

17:25.120 --> 17:28.640
shoot someone in the head and then spin around and punch someone in the face with the gun and

17:28.640 --> 17:33.840
I think we train that out he'd shoot somebody in the head and he'd turn around he'd be like no not

17:33.840 --> 17:44.160
I can't do this anymore I can't not anymore that's three number four person to do it Sarah

17:44.160 --> 17:50.480
Michelle Geller okay Michelle Geller is a it's an interesting choice that's a very good choice

17:50.480 --> 17:56.640
I'll tell you why because she's got a lot of experience navigating tv that's one thing you

17:56.640 --> 18:00.960
know she's had she's had a great career it's got a lot of different interesting places that's huge

18:00.960 --> 18:06.720
I want to detract yeah intimidation factor I think is also through the roof if I fuck him

18:06.720 --> 18:10.800
is in the laser tag arena and I saw Sarah Michelle Geller coming at me with one of those cool cyber

18:10.800 --> 18:15.280
guns I would say bye and I would leave I would leave I would leave after paying my money for

18:15.280 --> 18:19.360
my ticket into laser tag I would actually leave the place without having finished the match

18:19.360 --> 18:22.800
so scared would I be so scared would I be we've been watching a lot of Buffy

18:23.600 --> 18:29.520

we need one more and we need a what role we have the intimidator we have the the two we have Ariana

21:05.200 --> 21:10.880
Grande who I think Ariana Grande I think she was in the bad blood video mate was she in the bad

21:10.880 --> 21:16.720
blood video I think she did the bad blood I think she was in the bad blood video to some degree and

21:16.720 --> 21:20.720
so like I think you had to you had to have some sort of martial arts training to be included in

21:20.720 --> 21:28.800
that video hello I just got a call in and it's the best answer and it's Idris Elba is on the team

21:28.800 --> 21:34.320
oh he's currently filming the gunslinger oh so you know those skills are going to be hot he's

21:34.320 --> 21:39.440
gonna wear the outfit from the gunslinger he's maybe gonna tell me some inside dirt about the

21:39.440 --> 21:44.480
gunslinger it's all I want to know can we get some set photos leaked or something please hey

21:44.480 --> 21:50.480

21:50.480 --> 21:57.600
but I don't wanna who represents the reluctant warrior the one who's like I can't do this not

21:57.600 --> 22:05.520
again right but then like Michelle Geller okay yeah I think it's Keanu and then we pay a 12

22:05.520 --> 22:12.400
year old to kill his dog in front of him the 12 year old would shoot would buffet his dog with

22:12.400 --> 22:21.120
harmless lasers I would love to watch Keanu react to that no I see he's fine Keanu he's fine this

22:21.120 --> 22:26.160
is the light gun the dog would be wearing a very small laser tag vest and so it would like burst

22:26.160 --> 22:33.280
and he would have to leave the room and go have some pizza Idris Elba Ariana Grande Keanu Reeves

22:33.280 --> 22:37.440
Sarah Michelle Geller and some non-racist youtube superstar and boy that's going to be a tough

22:37.440 --> 22:43.920
needle to thread but fuck that's a good team huh take him to the limpos and they're Hannibal

22:43.920 --> 22:49.520
like they're they're like coach is Joe Biden and Joe Biden is there he drove them all there

22:49.520 --> 22:56.560
in his minivan he had to he needed he needed he had to well you had a bunch of tickets to turn

22:56.560 --> 23:02.080
in and tokens that he couldn't use anywhere else Olympic gold medalist laser tag team

23:03.280 --> 23:07.200
they got those laser guns already right that they do the decathlon they have the little laser rifles

23:07.200 --> 23:12.080
or whatever that they use instead of bullet guns right let's just just turn them on each other

23:12.080 --> 23:19.520
and pew pew pew I'm Idris Elba I got you um uh here's another question I recently ordered a

23:19.520 --> 23:24.960
couple pairs of jeans direct from Levi's and they arrived today that's it that's the entire

23:24.960 --> 23:33.040
question it's I don't know good I'm glad um no there's more I here it is the jeans were exactly

23:33.040 --> 23:38.480
what I ordered that's actually the end uh so just a positive experience this person oh no oh no

23:38.480 --> 23:43.920
that's right this is just a Levi's Yelp review yeah uh but there was also a brand new complete

23:43.920 --> 23:54.000
DVD box set of all six seasons of down navi all right nice um this is not unwelcome because I love

23:54.000 --> 24:03.840
the show but I didn't order it and also you can't order DVDs from levi.com am I good that's from

24:03.840 --> 24:12.720
nonplus in Nevada um a little you actually didn't realize that this is part of a new exciting cross

24:12.720 --> 24:19.840
promotional uh sort of ad uh uh the campaign that's going on right now where they are doing

24:19.840 --> 24:24.720
a seventh season of Downton Abbey and all the characters are wearing just the most well-fitting

24:25.600 --> 24:32.400
just luscious blue jeans you've ever seen on any tv show it's a bit anachronistic and it kind of

24:32.400 --> 24:38.960
goes against the whole like tone of the show but it's like Wellesley help me dress and then an

24:38.960 --> 24:44.720
older man helps a still pretty old man put on some very nice jeans I'll tell you guys exactly

24:44.720 --> 24:54.480
what happened here some bumbling uh you know just uh clumsy Levi's warehouse worker has shown up to

24:54.480 --> 25:01.280
their aunt's birthday party empty-handed they stopped by the sun coast on their way to work

25:01.280 --> 25:09.280
to pick up a birthday present for their aunt and now they're left box set less I see so they were

25:09.280 --> 25:14.560
and they had to make a stop by the the the blue jeans factory still carrying their box set with

25:14.560 --> 25:21.600
them and they were standing over the denim vat and they were oh no and they dropped the box set

25:21.600 --> 25:28.800
into the denim vat which then printed out the blue jeans and the dvds were just made it in the box

25:28.800 --> 25:37.840
exactly I just I mean I'm assuming that this happened in like a fulfillment center right

25:37.840 --> 25:44.080
this has happened in a place that fulfills Levi's orders and Downton Abbey orders but I do have a

25:44.080 --> 25:51.040
problem with like you look in a box there's jeans in the box is this one for the okay yeah just go

25:51.040 --> 25:55.920
ahead and maybe I don't know I'm very busy we have a lot of we've got a lot of jeans to get rid of

25:55.920 --> 26:04.080
today I do also want to point out origin story I know you're wondering yes John Cougar Mellencamp

26:04.080 --> 26:11.520
did fall the Joker style into the denim vat and that is that is his cruel origin if he had fallen

26:11.520 --> 26:17.760
into the box set DVD of Downton Abbey vat right next to it he would have had a completely different

26:17.760 --> 26:24.240
yeah completely different arc a proper bloke I'm it's me John Cougar Mellencamp a proper bloke

26:24.240 --> 26:30.960
like on Downton Abbey does this little ditty about Lord Grantham and Lady Grantham that's him

26:31.840 --> 26:39.600
it rhymes uh did uh does this person owe a call to levies.com yes you stole their dvds definitely

26:39.600 --> 26:44.560
you should call them I mean you should have won this might be the golden ticket like you won

26:45.440 --> 26:51.520
you get to you get to go on a tour of the denim factory with a uh idiosyncratic

26:51.520 --> 26:59.520
leader of the company who's going to well here's the thing gonna kill four kids and that's just

26:59.520 --> 27:05.280
that's non-negotiable Billy Tonka but they're gonna be it's Billy Tonka the leader of Levi's

27:05.280 --> 27:10.320
I know you would think Levi would be in his name somewhere but no no anyway four kids will suffer

27:10.320 --> 27:14.800
a horrible fate but you'll learn a lot about morality or whatever and all the jeans you can eat

27:15.760 --> 27:20.320
I feel like you have to call if only because Levi's owes you an explanation

27:20.320 --> 27:26.960
for how this could happen like you are on the edge of like a a serial style mystery here that

27:26.960 --> 27:32.480
you could unravel and then get back to us and just like call Levi's don't let them off the hook

27:32.480 --> 27:38.160
until you understand how Downton Abbey all six seasons in a complete DVD box set

27:39.200 --> 27:44.880
arrived it with your jeans you deserve an answer that can't be cheap right we're talking at least

27:44.880 --> 27:50.800
a hundred dollar box set on the deals yeah you know that's nobody's buying DVDs anymore

27:51.440 --> 27:57.440
I think those DVDs are subsidized by the by the MacArthur Foundation or something like that so

27:57.440 --> 28:01.760
I think they're not actually that expensive pretty assuming who's been trying to scale back

28:01.760 --> 28:06.160
their material uh possessions and clutter I would actually be pretty bummed about somebody

28:06.960 --> 28:12.560
sending me a huge DVD box set at this point like I really I do not have a shelf space

28:12.560 --> 28:17.520
you know what I mean yeah exactly I'm asking if you get call them back and ask if you can

28:17.520 --> 28:23.760
trade it in for that I got the Downton love it uh don't want to be ungrateful but I would like a

28:23.760 --> 28:32.160
gift card in place of this item I'm now thinking of in the Levi's blue jeans factory what the

28:32.160 --> 28:37.840
equivalent room of the room where Willy Wonka sang pure imagination would be like we're just

28:37.840 --> 28:43.600
everything is made out of blue jeans and denim everything is wearable you can wear any to see

28:43.600 --> 28:52.480
that flower put it on um how about a yahoo yeah sure this one was sent in by brooks oglesby thank

28:52.480 --> 28:58.800
you brooks it's yahoo answers user oath user sorry something's gone wrong uh this would this

28:58.800 --> 29:03.040
is good this would be a good um like parlance we can just say when something has gone wrong

29:03.040 --> 29:08.720
they are an oath breaker who has left the service before their watch has ended um this oath breaker

29:08.720 --> 29:14.720
asks could I play video games for the school talent show I just answered a question on here

29:14.720 --> 29:23.200
that reminded me to ask this I have I have hardly any talents but I'm a video game expert when I

29:23.200 --> 29:28.240
start a game I always begin on expert and usually end it my school has this huge tv thing I think

29:28.240 --> 29:32.640
um could I simply hook up my xbox 360 and play on the big screen thing so everyone sees as my

29:32.640 --> 29:36.400
talent like it's a first-person shooter or something do you think they'll let me it is like

29:36.400 --> 29:45.040
one of my only talents that I can possibly do all right um the the short answer is I would lose my

29:45.040 --> 29:49.440
fucking mind if I was still in high school and somebody was like what's up my name is Derek

29:49.440 --> 29:55.600
here's some monoscopes and then he gets up there and does his thing that would be I would watch

29:55.600 --> 30:01.440
I would watch that and be absolutely thrilled just no pressure or anything but if you tell people

30:01.440 --> 30:08.480
like I this is worth watching you can watch this I feel like it it's a bit you're you cannot fuck

30:08.480 --> 30:14.320
up at all this game's called Call of Duty this game's called Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 I'm

30:14.320 --> 30:18.640
gonna play around search and destroy all right nerd and then like fucking 30 seconds in you're

30:18.640 --> 30:26.080
like oh my god he's doing it it's really doing it here's the thing like I was all prepared to

30:26.080 --> 30:30.960
make jokes about this and then I remember like there are people who are like super famous for

30:30.960 --> 30:38.080
doing this oh yeah sure sure sure but um maybe not among their high school peers I don't know

30:38.080 --> 30:45.040
nowadays what did you guys ever participate in a high school talent show please tell me now if you

30:45.040 --> 30:53.040
did high school no no not that uh elementary school for sure I I just starred in all the

30:53.040 --> 31:00.240
school plays I didn't need to do a town I I co-hosted my high school talent show this is not

31:00.240 --> 31:08.240
a bit um either my junior or senior year with a gentleman named Richard and Richard was the school

31:08.240 --> 31:16.960
magician um but wait hold on he was designated as such he was the kid who like I know my thing

31:16.960 --> 31:22.640
it's gonna be magic and so he would always be doing like little card tricks at the lunch in

31:22.640 --> 31:27.840
the lunch room and so me and Richard hosted the talent show one year and fucking people were

31:27.840 --> 31:37.760
eating out of our hands up on that stage um and I this is horrible a uh a young woman got up there

31:37.760 --> 31:45.120
to play a piano song uh that was really lovely um and I think she ended up coming in like second

31:45.120 --> 31:50.800
place for the competition um and I want to just hit this very hard the people very much enjoyed

31:50.800 --> 31:55.840
her set but as we intro'd her our thing was like wouldn't it be funny if we got up there and did

31:55.840 --> 32:00.560
a magic trick so we went up there and he did this very long-winded magic trick because behind the

32:00.560 --> 32:04.320
curtain they had to set up like her piano and they had to clear off the last the last thing

32:04.320 --> 32:08.800
and the magic trick was very long-winded and had very many steps of me picking a card and then

32:08.800 --> 32:11.680
going out and showing a few people in the audience the card you know really fucking work and I'm

32:11.680 --> 32:15.760
getting a mean at my hand and then we got up there and said all right time for the magic

32:15.760 --> 32:20.080
tree to end and he just threw all the cards up in the air and that was it and we like walked off

32:20.080 --> 32:25.360
the stage it's like a joke like haha fuck you guys very like um you know transgressive comedy

32:25.360 --> 32:33.280
and the audience was booing very loud as the curtain opened oh for this for this young woman

32:33.280 --> 32:39.600
to play her music song and she I'll say this it was a hostile room we created a hostile environment

32:39.600 --> 32:45.920
she won them back and it was a story of redemption but oh my god did I feel absolutely awful because

32:45.920 --> 32:51.760
I like as soon as we did it I walked on the stage like oh that was a bad idea we created a not good

32:51.760 --> 32:55.680
workspace here I think Richard Griffin I actually thought that was going to go a different direction

32:55.680 --> 33:00.240
I thought you were going to say that the magic trick was Richard made her piano disappear leaving

33:00.240 --> 33:05.120
her completely unable to perform her song now you tell me how that trick would have gone down

33:06.160 --> 33:09.200
I probably would have gone down really well if he had been able to pull it off

33:09.920 --> 33:13.840
I guess that's true I would I want to watch this kid play video games now

33:15.120 --> 33:21.680
I do want to see him play video games there is a very there's a very thin like there's a tight

33:21.680 --> 33:28.960
rope that he could pull this off and if he did but isn't this true think about it anybody who gets

33:28.960 --> 33:34.240
up if they're like my talent I'm gonna shred on the electric guitar like you have to be good you

33:34.240 --> 33:39.760
can't just like get up and kind of like pick out some like chords or if you got up and you're like

33:39.760 --> 33:44.880
I I'm gonna play piano and you only know like heart and soul like no you if you get up there

33:44.880 --> 33:49.760
you're inherently saying I am very confident in my ability to do this in an entertaining way

33:50.560 --> 33:56.560
so like I don't know if this kid's confident enough to get up there and play some video games

33:56.560 --> 34:01.120
yeah I'd like to see that and it it also depends on the game because I don't know that I would be

34:01.120 --> 34:05.040
so psyched to just like watch somebody do very well while playing call of duty but if you heard

34:05.040 --> 34:09.440
like all right here comes Jeff and he's gonna play some video games and you're like whatever

34:09.440 --> 34:14.400
and then the curtains parted and there were four DDR machines standing side by side by side and

34:14.400 --> 34:19.920
he was like what's up my name is Jeff I'm gonna do paranoia survivor max on four machines at once

34:19.920 --> 34:26.080
here I go and he like does the damn thing I might lose my fucking mind yeah that will be I think the

34:26.080 --> 34:32.800
musical element is huge I because I worry that the perform like even if it's sick the performance

34:32.800 --> 34:37.200
aspect of it is not going to be great like you're not gonna people aren't going to know what's cool

34:37.840 --> 34:43.920
unless every few minutes you look back at them like right dig it that kind of thing yeah oh

34:43.920 --> 34:48.400
that's what you do you you turn the tv so the audience can't see it and you just look at them

34:48.400 --> 34:55.360
and just occasionally say I'm doing a great job this is just keep giving score updates from time

to pony we probably wouldn't be together now that's insane thank you for taking me to candle

38:42.480 --> 38:48.320

38:48.320 --> 38:54.480
my favorite human my best friend and the only one i want to sing disney songs with let's do this

38:54.480 --> 39:05.040
what a lucky couple to have seen carly rae jepsen in concert live sure it is a it is you go to you

39:05.040 --> 39:12.720
go to church like that and you leave different change how metamorphosized how do you fellows

39:12.720 --> 39:21.680
think us breaking down the lyrics of pony got two humans yeah i don't want to i don't want to be

39:21.680 --> 39:26.160
ribald here but i mean they're very erotically charged lyrics and we read them in a way that

39:26.160 --> 39:31.680
was maybe sensual to some folks yeah i'm not gonna yuck any yums but if that if you found that

39:31.680 --> 39:36.960
sensual that's fine do you think it seems like these two did two people listening independently

39:36.960 --> 39:42.720
on different ends of a bar to us discuss very rib both kind of like made eye contact at the same

39:42.720 --> 39:48.320
time and just mouthed pony question mark and they just nodded and from that point forward

39:48.320 --> 39:55.680
they were inseparable i think that's the most likely situation yeah i feel like that this this

39:55.680 --> 40:01.680
if i had to guess and i'm completely completely guessing but i feel like that this probably

40:01.680 --> 40:07.120
started out as a joke and then at some point one of the two parties started saying the lyrics a

40:07.120 --> 40:12.240
lot more sincerely until at one point someone looked directly in the other person's eyes and

40:12.240 --> 40:22.480
said hey no but seriously if you're horny yeah let's do it write it my pony

40:24.640 --> 40:31.600
my saddle's waiting juices flowing down your thigh okay this next message that's a lyric

40:31.600 --> 40:36.640
i'm not it's a lyric of this i know it is griffin it just don't like to hear you say it in a

40:36.640 --> 40:45.680

41:04.880 --> 41:11.280
p and by the way i'm sorry i my all apologies to genuine for skipping the best line in the song

41:11.280 --> 41:16.000

41:16.000 --> 41:22.800

now at max funcon.com the weather's starting to be nice around here which means doing stuff outdoors

45:26.800 --> 45:32.480
there's one part of my outdoor repertoire that's sadly missing i never learned how to ride a bike

45:32.480 --> 45:41.440
okay i'm 30 uh uh as a 33 year old how do i do that i mean the obvious answer is just to hop

45:41.440 --> 45:46.640
up and do it but it's not like they sell adult bikes with trading wheels and that's from pining

45:46.640 --> 45:54.880
to pedal in pittsburgh oh my this is a really it's a really good question it's a good question um

45:55.600 --> 46:01.680
i bought a bike last year um because i live in austin like everybody bikes and so i was like i

46:01.680 --> 46:06.880
could hey i can do this i need to close mark lucas's official website by the way he's got a

46:06.880 --> 46:12.320
store never mind does he have any music auto playing he does he's got a music section anyway

46:12.320 --> 46:17.360
um and so i went i like bought a bike and i went to the bike shop and found a bike i really like

46:17.360 --> 46:19.920
i was like hell yeah he's like do you want to try it out i was like yeah sure and i went in

46:19.920 --> 46:26.480
the parking lot and got on and i was like hey wait a minute it's been like fucking 15 years

46:26.480 --> 46:30.960
since i've done this i'm gonna fall over and a bus is gonna hit me and it's gonna be really

46:30.960 --> 46:37.280
embarrassing and deadly um and so like i'm i'm right there with you because i don't know there's

46:37.280 --> 46:43.840
a way to get out of this with hold on griffin i do want to know the rest of that um when you

46:43.840 --> 46:49.120
tried it out in the parking lot and realized you were going to die did you then turn to the sales

46:49.120 --> 46:55.040
person and say oh one second thought no i was like i'll take it i'll ride it around in small

46:55.040 --> 47:03.040
concentric circles in my empty garage um no i uh i i just did it and it was very fucking wobbly

47:03.040 --> 47:06.480
and i looked like i looked like i mean i looked like a fucking toddler learning to ride a bike

47:06.480 --> 47:12.160
again because it literally had been half my life since i'd been on a bike bike cycle um there are

47:12.160 --> 47:18.640
a couple of big problems with this the first off is a big part of learning to ride a bike is falling

47:18.640 --> 47:27.360
and when you're young you can just fall like you just fall and it's fine and when you're 33 years

47:27.360 --> 47:34.880
old and fall it's not fine it's i mean well it's hysterical for starters but it's also very dangerous

47:34.880 --> 47:40.960
because you're gonna be there you have a lot longer to go and your bones are older so it's not

47:40.960 --> 47:46.720
a good idea to just fall repeatedly the other problem is if a kid is riding their bike on the

47:46.720 --> 47:52.400
sidewalk that's adorable if an adult is riding their bike on the sidewalk is it it's a crime

47:52.400 --> 47:58.480
yeah especially riding poorly yeah yeah that's where i bailed actually on bike riding is i got

47:58.480 --> 48:04.000
to an age where people were like go ride in the street and that i had a look at like where the

48:04.000 --> 48:11.520
cars are do you know how fast they go do you want me to go as fast as a car you gave him that you

48:11.520 --> 48:16.720
gave him that dominic toretto but it's only two wheels it's only two wheels doesn't make sense

48:16.720 --> 48:20.880
can't do it here's the thing here's the thing question asker and maybe this will be a little

48:20.880 --> 48:27.920
controversial but i think that the reason kids learn to ride bikes is because at the time it is

48:27.920 --> 48:34.880
the only vehicle it is the best vehicle option open to them as an adult you can drive a car with

48:34.880 --> 48:39.760
the windows down no bikes are great bikes are good and they're good for the environment they're good

48:39.760 --> 48:44.320
for you and they're fun to ride around on yes but my point being if you haven't learned how to ride

48:44.320 --> 48:50.560
one up to this point like it's not too late no you can go your whole life you can go i'm not saying

48:50.560 --> 48:55.760
it's too late i'm saying you could go your whole life saint peter is not going to meet you at the

48:55.760 --> 49:00.320
pearly gates like so never learned how to ride a bike come go to hell like it just isn't going to

49:00.320 --> 49:05.120
happen that's defeatist i'm just saying it's going to be harder than if you had learned as a child

49:05.120 --> 49:09.680
that's all i'm saying so how would you how here's how you learn here's how you learn to ride a bike

49:09.680 --> 49:14.080
when you're a little kid and there's this moment you have riding a bike is so weird because it's

49:14.080 --> 49:19.520
one of the very few things in life we're just like once you do it right the first time you do it right

49:19.520 --> 49:25.920
every time after that it's like once you realize like oh if i just go is fine um if i just like

49:25.920 --> 49:32.720
keep pedaling and moving forward like it'll it'll hold me up and it'll be good um and so this is me

49:32.720 --> 49:37.840
griffin mcelroy giving you a 100 guarantee if you get on that bike and you just start pedaling

49:37.840 --> 49:44.080
really fast you'll be you'll be okay you're not the top of a high hill commit yourself to it no

49:44.080 --> 49:49.920
don't don't peanuts this person no um you're 33 years old you've got a lot more control over your

49:49.920 --> 49:55.120
body at this point that's the one thing is your limbs and stuff you are super good you know how

49:55.120 --> 50:00.160
to work those things don't be afraid to do it i'm gonna go back to what i decided to stay and buy it

50:00.160 --> 50:05.920
with the car thing because when you're a little kid and you fall over on your bike it's frustrating

50:05.920 --> 50:10.960
but you have no other option left available to you i'm saying i am 33 if i had never learned how to

50:10.960 --> 50:15.360
ride a bike the first time i fell over like well fuck this i'm gonna get in the thing with four

50:15.360 --> 50:23.920
wheels now and doors um can you take an act i stand by my point your bad point i stand by it

50:23.920 --> 50:33.200
it out a classified ad for a dad a class oh my god just hear me out a dad of any age or a mom

50:33.200 --> 50:40.880
our our dad handled the teaching in our family but take an ad out for a dad and say hey i need

50:40.880 --> 50:47.920
a dad to just hold it until i'm ready and then wait before i'm ready phrasing phrasing okay we'll

50:47.920 --> 50:54.480
put the word bike in there thank you to keep the to keep the mystery i need a dad to hold it till

50:54.480 --> 51:05.280
i'm ready um i'll do this fuck it this is my new project i'm gonna do it no i'll teach folks how

51:05.280 --> 51:09.920
to ride a bike it's not a big deal let me grab the back of that seat and go you did it yeah don't

51:09.920 --> 51:14.320
just keep doing it yeah you did it put this in your earbuds and go get on your bike but don't be in

51:14.320 --> 51:19.680
the street because you need to be able to hear the sounds that cars make when you're biking in front

51:19.680 --> 51:24.400
of them and just like listen to this right now all right pedal yeah yeah keep going keep going

51:24.400 --> 51:27.280
keep don't stop you're not gonna fall over you're fine you're fine you're fine you're fine all right

51:27.280 --> 51:34.480
you did it you're biking that's it just like that griffin's one half disc seminar on biking okay okay

51:34.480 --> 51:40.000
okay okay let's put the money where the mouth is it's i'm see i'm sensing a conflict between griffin

51:40.000 --> 51:44.880
uh my brother and travis my brother here is here is what i'm suggesting griffin

51:46.320 --> 51:50.400
facetime this person when they're about ready to start learning how to ride a bike

51:50.400 --> 51:56.480
you give them 30 minutes with you as i don't have 30 minutes i can do maybe two

51:57.840 --> 52:02.080
15 minutes you only need two with me because it's just like get on the bike and pedal don't stop

52:02.080 --> 52:07.520
go all right you did it i'm i've been griffin bye will you do that will you give this person five

52:07.520 --> 52:15.360
minutes of your time skyping video griffin in your pocket just to encouraging them how to ride a bike

52:15.360 --> 52:21.600
yes absolutely okay get it griffin hit me up and then and then when you fall over and you're ready

52:21.600 --> 52:26.240
to quit let me know yeah i'll skype with you and be like it's totally cool go get a car

52:27.360 --> 52:32.640
and then and uh i i've got a toddler so i've really got to manage my own time i'm sorry i

52:32.640 --> 52:38.080
wish you the very best but this is about all i can spare you uh you have to you have to get

52:38.080 --> 52:48.400
into a bike race with justin's toddler and um whoever wins gets to run the old summer camp

52:49.120 --> 52:56.000
down whoever wins gets justin yeah um how about yahoo real quick yeah i think we can work one

52:56.000 --> 53:01.680
one in i've got one about listen i'll be honest i'll tell you i got two i got one wait

53:01.680 --> 53:09.440
wait just very quick i just have to say blue ksmr out loud because i should have said it earlier

53:09.440 --> 53:19.280
oh like blue ksmr blue ksmr channel blue k blue ksmr hit us on blue ksmr can't do it can't blue ksmr

53:19.280 --> 53:24.400
can't tm is blue ksmr can't do it okay fine but i tm my blue ksmr

53:24.400 --> 53:31.680
i have one ksmr okay i got two questions here one of them is about it does reference jimmy

53:31.680 --> 53:35.440
buffett and the other one references austin powers like which one are you which well do

53:35.440 --> 53:42.800
you guys alternate word for word no i'll read them both one's sending one is from oathbreaker

53:42.800 --> 53:49.520
kyle fleming thank you kyle it's from oathbreaker sloughlin0931 who asks is jack sparrow a better

53:49.520 --> 53:55.360
island icon than jimmy buffett the other one was sent by level 9000 oathbreaker drew davenport by

53:55.360 --> 54:01.280
oathbreaker fur k who says where can i find austin powers type decorating ideas for a yacht

54:03.600 --> 54:08.880
tie it all together i vote the first one i think that's just because you want to talk a lot about

54:08.880 --> 54:14.400
jimmy buffett as always i'll work austin powers in there all right yeah we'll come around to

54:14.400 --> 54:19.280
austin powers we'll answer both of one thing so let me say this first off because it's not been

54:19.280 --> 54:25.520
made abundantly clear my wife is the one who turned me on to jimmy but don't this don't now listen

54:25.520 --> 54:31.520
tweet at my wife and tell her you know that everyone everyone tweeted sydney and tell her

54:31.520 --> 54:36.640
that she liked jimmy buffett first so she will get off my back about it okay that's the first

54:36.640 --> 54:41.120
thing wait wait wait tweet it tweet at my wife so there's austin there's the austin powers joke

54:41.120 --> 54:49.680
well that's borat uh moving on the best island icon is james buffett and you asked me why well

54:49.680 --> 54:57.600
i have a good answer for you jb when he's on an island he's not trying to get back off that island

54:57.600 --> 55:06.000
as soon as humanly possible and that does seem to be the mo of mr jack sparrow jb learned how to

55:06.000 --> 55:12.720
fly a plane so if he wasn't at an island he would he had one within reach theoretically speaking at

55:12.720 --> 55:18.640
all times able to get back to an island when necessary let me ask you a question justin two

55:18.640 --> 55:27.120
questions question one what are mr buffett's feelings on rum and it being gone uh okay what's

55:27.120 --> 55:33.120
your second question the second question is is he at all related to sailors has he ever done it

55:33.120 --> 55:40.000
all related to sailors has he ever done any sailing well uh okay here's the answer to your

55:40.000 --> 55:46.400
first question is there is a margaritaville rum so i bet he feels sad about it yeah he would not

55:46.400 --> 55:52.960
he would not feel good about that because he made rum himself margaritaville rum.com just go catch

55:52.960 --> 56:00.000
the spirit by which i mean rum uh so jb made a dark rum and what was your second question uh is

56:00.000 --> 56:07.280
he related to sailors in any way does he know how to sail does jimmy buffett what are you what are

56:07.280 --> 56:13.040
you talking about because here's the thing jack sparrow listen he's kind of bumbly but he always

56:13.040 --> 56:20.640
seems to know what he's doing but when it comes to boatsmanship oh my god jack sparrow he is he's a

56:20.640 --> 56:28.640
deft hand at the wheel would you say he's the son of a son of a sailor he probably is travis patrick

56:28.640 --> 56:36.000
mackleroy i know he's at least the son of one sailor one one generation i have to start reading

56:36.000 --> 56:41.600
these answers because there's a hundred of them and each one is a beautiful diamond that god made

56:41.600 --> 56:46.720
in heaven uh i'm just gonna read them without reading the names because again there are so many

56:46.720 --> 56:52.640
that i need to get through duh captain jack sparrow he is way finer jack sparrow more people

56:52.640 --> 57:03.120
know him uh yep jack sparrow is hot i love jack sparrow who's the other dude uh it's a near tie

57:03.120 --> 57:07.600
but i would say that jack sparrow nearly beats out jimmy buffett if only jack would sing about rum

57:07.600 --> 57:16.960
then he'd be a winner for sure he definitely did in most of the movies although i love jack sparrow

57:16.960 --> 57:22.720
jimmy buffett is the original margaritaville king all right one one notch there for jimmy buffett and

57:22.720 --> 57:27.840
then the best answer maybe of all time and if they shut oath down tomorrow please let this be

57:27.840 --> 57:36.960
it's swan song david e one decade ago says it doesn't take 10 years ago it says one decade ago

57:37.520 --> 57:45.600
says the seaplane ship sailing margarita and rum pot smoking book writing musician party animal and

57:45.600 --> 57:53.600
leader of the parrot heads of course jack sparrow is a poser hell jack can't even get any p word

57:53.600 --> 58:01.360
that refers to a vagina let alone he doesn't use dope which we seen in deadwood of the wild west

58:01.360 --> 58:08.240
why wouldn't pirates use it oh it's a disney film jimmy is the party while jack is just for himself

58:08.240 --> 58:17.440
who's the better icon okay i want to say that my favorite part about this is had this not been a

58:17.440 --> 58:24.160
disney movie there would have been so many scenes of jack sparrow just getting fucking lit it is

58:24.160 --> 58:32.320
already implied that basically anytime jack sparrow hoes out of frame he is smoking marijuana

58:32.320 --> 58:38.960
if you do not see him at that moment in that scene in full frame he is smoking marijuana that

58:38.960 --> 58:47.280
is even if you can see him but his back is to you he is holding a tasty rip oh man

58:48.880 --> 58:57.600
jack sparrow is just for himself jimmy is jimmy is the party the only people make a lot of fan art

58:57.600 --> 59:04.160
related to our family of products the only one i'm interested in anymore is pictures

59:04.160 --> 59:09.360
just pictures of jimmy buffett and jack sparrow hanging out just shaking hands coming together

59:10.480 --> 59:14.880
just living that island lifestyle i mean let's let's put it this way guys if you're going to

59:14.880 --> 59:20.880
hang out on an island for an afternoon with one of these characters and i do say that i'm sure

59:20.880 --> 59:25.840
james buffett in his private life isn't quite as island obsessed as jimmy buffett the performer

59:25.840 --> 59:30.560
and songwriter and restaurateur which one would you rather hang out with because i think this

59:30.560 --> 59:35.280
person's right that jimmy buffett would want to like you would roll up and jimmy would be like

59:35.280 --> 59:40.800
hey good news the shrimp are about ready to come off the grill sit down let me get you a corona or

59:40.800 --> 59:47.600
maybe a tequila from the margaritaville line um that would be more up your alley jack sparrow

59:47.600 --> 59:52.080
would just be trying to steal your identity the entire time that's a good point that is fair you

59:52.080 --> 59:56.720
never know where you stand with jack sparrow i guarantee like you trust jimmy buffett right away

59:56.720 --> 01:00:03.520
because i doubt he has the energy to lie to you it's just like yep i yep i'm here for myself like

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.320
cool jimmy buffett thank you for being very upfront with me jimmy jimmy buffett is probably thrown

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:17.280
to 20 000 boat-based parties in his awesome amazing life and in none of them has anybody

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:23.680
ever been marooned and that's all i'm gonna say there is who would you want to stand side by side

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:31.520
with in a battle against like evil skeletal pirates uh jimmy jimmy buffett okay all right

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.720
buffett do you know why you got any others jimmy buffett has a lot of money and he lives nowadays

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:44.960
so he could probably buy like a big machine gun and just rip him the fuck up in a cloud of bullets

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:52.880
here's what i want here's what i want here's what i want i want fan art of james buffett and jack

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:59.920
sparrow standing together both in skeletal form they've taken some doubloons out of the the chest

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.560
and they're both holding the balloons they're both skeletons and they you can see the giant

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.840
clouds of weed in their chest cavities fuck yeah dude and maybe it's kind of seeping through their

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:16.640
ribs and they're both just like high-fiving and holding up coins some some mall kiosk t-shirt

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:24.880
spray painter just had a chill go up their spine uh folks that's gonna do it for us thank you so

off the album putting the days to bed and that the term departure was like some hip lingo for like
