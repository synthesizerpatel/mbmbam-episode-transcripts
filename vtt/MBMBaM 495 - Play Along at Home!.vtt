WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.480
Travis McElroy, this is Justin Griffin. Sorry to rush, boys,

00:50.480 --> 00:54.240
but we don't have time to, excuse my language, fart around.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.800
We need to get down to business. It's not going to happen,

00:56.800 --> 01:05.120
Travis. We are a month a month into 2020, and I don't know that there's any more laughter or love

01:05.120 --> 01:09.840
happening out there than normal. I think maybe even marginally less.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.200
This is a weird vibe to put down. I know you've been out the game for a little bit.

01:15.200 --> 01:20.320
I know you've been doing the baby stuff. Not a lot of sleep, I'd guess.

01:20.320 --> 01:26.080
Not a lot of sleep, but Justin and I like to take it fucking slow, baby.

01:26.080 --> 01:32.720
Yeah, it's a building game. You can't checkmate on day 27th.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.800
You can't checkmate on the 27th move of the chess game.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.600
No one's ever done it. And I'm pretty sure, Justin,

01:39.600 --> 01:42.640
just and I know that you've actually learned about chess and I haven't,

01:42.640 --> 01:46.880
but if you checkmate on any move, I think it's just the last move of the game.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.800
Yeah, they usually stop there. There's not a bonus round for more points.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.240
It's not like checkmate. Now let's see where this goes.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.760
I filled my life accidentally. My life was filled with laughter

01:57.760 --> 01:59.840
and love this week, and I'd like to highlight it.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.400
Sydney and I were on a road trip, our first road trip away from the children this week.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.840
Was it intentional or accidental? Like, Kevin! Kevin! No, it was a regular,

02:11.840 --> 02:17.920
non-humiliated situation. We stopped at a gas station in the middle of Zilcho, Ohio.

02:17.920 --> 02:24.960
Just nowhere as well, Ohio. And we went in the gas station and we got some snacks,

02:24.960 --> 02:28.720
and the lady at the counter said, these are buy one, get one free.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.760
And that made us have to get a lot more snacks than we wanted,

02:31.760 --> 02:35.440
but they were buy one, get one free, so we're not going to leave some freebies behind.

02:36.080 --> 02:42.080
And the fella in coveralls behind us announces,

02:42.080 --> 02:47.360
if Bernie Sanders wins, those will all be free. I said, huh?

02:47.360 --> 02:51.200
That's an interesting energy was delivered to that statement.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.680
He said, if Bernie Sanders wins, those will all be free.

02:53.680 --> 02:59.760
Was he saying it in like a, won't that be totally fucking rad, I love free snacks kind of way?

02:59.760 --> 03:06.800
Sydney said, actually that sounds, without missing a beat, actually that sounds pretty good

03:06.800 --> 03:12.480
because of all the free snacks. And he said, it's not, it's scary.

03:12.480 --> 03:17.600
Okay, listen, this is not an endorsement one way or the other,

03:17.600 --> 03:21.920
but I'm pretty sure any candidate saying like, and hey, free snacks.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.640
And hey, who here likes combos?

03:24.640 --> 03:27.760
Right? No one's going to be like, I don't like your free snack policies.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.880
If Bernie Sanders wins, all those snacks are free. Like that, yeah.

03:32.880 --> 03:38.480
Okay. That, sir, I can tell by your whole steez, you don't think that sounds chill,

03:38.480 --> 03:43.200
but if you break down the words, I don't think you could put accents on any of them

03:43.200 --> 03:47.120
in a way that makes it not sound extremely good and chill.

03:47.120 --> 03:52.960
Right. These colors don't run unless those Pringles are free 99,

03:52.960 --> 03:57.120
in which case I'm fucking out of here, man. No way.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.040
Yeah. So that was, that was filled my life with laughter that day.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.560
I just want to let you guys know.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.920
So I went to the mall and started handing out little paper bags of potpourri

04:05.920 --> 04:09.920
that I had made, dried out my own sort of apple slices,

04:09.920 --> 04:13.360
dried those the fuck out and I put some thyme and-

04:13.360 --> 04:14.320
That sounds gross.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.760
It's just apple and thyme.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.720
Listen, Griffin, I'm glad you filled your life with love.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.360
No, it's gross.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.400
You know, I have a recipe if you start with grapes and thyme.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.560
Do you know what you get when you mix grapes and thyme?

04:28.560 --> 04:28.880
What?

04:29.440 --> 04:29.920
Raisins.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.560
That's filled my life with laughter and love. Thank you, Justin.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.760
You can't hear it, but I'm laughing really fucking hard at that.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.720
Boys, step aside, okay?

04:38.720 --> 04:40.400
I have an idea that's going to turn this whole year around.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.240
I feel like I have felt like you've had an idea, Trav,

04:44.240 --> 04:47.360
and that's why you've sort of been handling this intro the way you have.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.240
Listen, I'm kind of the idea man around here and everyone knows that

04:50.240 --> 04:52.400
and everyone agrees I'm super good at it.

04:52.400 --> 04:57.760
I think that you've got a fucking huge load of my bim bam goofs.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.360
I've got all my energy is backed up.

04:59.360 --> 05:04.640
You've been saving up and you need to just sort of clean the barrel a little bit.

05:04.640 --> 05:08.800
Yeah, I need to discharge some of my goof juice.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.160
Right, get it, get it.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.480
Justin and I are going to go leave and you do your dirty thing

05:14.480 --> 05:15.920
and then we'll come back when you're done.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.360
This is my pitch.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.920
The 20 funny challenge.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.560
Everybody loves those viral challenges.

05:22.560 --> 05:28.560
The ice bucket challenge, the other ones, the bottle flip challenge.

05:28.560 --> 05:34.320
Planking, that one where you eat a spoonful of cinnamon.

05:34.960 --> 05:39.200
Laying down in the middle of the road to prove to your coach that you made business.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.040
Yes, all of these.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.640
Eat a whole basketball.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.080
Yes, I have two ideas.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.920
One I think definitely has legs, but one has potential.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.760
I'm going to start with that one and it's this.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.840
Do you want to say, do you want to say, do you want to get ahead of this?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.480
Do you want to stand right ahead of this and lay down on the road

05:56.480 --> 05:59.760
like I did for my coach and say anything you're about to say, Travis,

05:59.760 --> 06:03.440
people are actually going to do and send you a trillion pictures of on Tweeto.

06:03.440 --> 06:08.000
Okay, part one is you say, you know, hi, it's, and then you say your name,

06:08.800 --> 06:11.120
and I'm doing the 20 funny challenge.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.560
Fill your life with laughter and love.

06:13.120 --> 06:18.240
And then part three is you nominate the next person to do the challenge.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.080
Right there in the middle, part two, you film yourself

06:22.080 --> 06:26.560
watching the entirety of the movie Garfield starring Bill Murray.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.680
That could be good.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.800
Can it be also Tale of Two Kitties or just the first one?

06:31.440 --> 06:34.400
Huh, that's a good, yeah, I think if you're really committed

06:34.400 --> 06:38.880
to 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love, you do that, sure.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.600
So is it a video of them watching the movie?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.680
Yes, it's on their face the whole time.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.240
Okay, on YouTube for people to find, is that the idea?

06:48.240 --> 06:50.960
Well, I don't want there to be any kind of legal issues

06:50.960 --> 06:54.480
with the 20 funny challenge, so we can't show the movie.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.600
So the movie edit must be muted.

06:57.600 --> 06:57.840
Yes.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.280
Or else we're gonna get copyrights, right?

06:59.280 --> 07:01.760
So you need to watch Garfield muted.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.160
With your ear pods in or whatever.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.520
So this one, I think this one's got legs.

07:07.520 --> 07:13.360
I think it's got legs, but this one could be the next big viral thing.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.600
And it goes a little something like this.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.720
You say your name, say, hey, it would go like this.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.840
Okay, I can see from your guys' faces you're not getting the name part.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.040
I'll say it like it's me.

07:23.760 --> 07:27.040
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm doing the 20 funny challenge.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.880
Fill your life with laughter and love.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.600
And then you tell a bad joke, a dad joke.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.200
Mine, for example, would be a skeleton walks into a bar

07:35.200 --> 07:36.800
and orders a drink and a mop.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.800
And then you say something nice about the person

07:40.800 --> 07:42.400
you're nominating to do it next.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.600
Like I would say, and I'm nominating my brother Justin.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.160
He's always been there for me, and he's never let me down.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.440
And I love him.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.800
No, that's the fucking joke.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.440
Okay, now Griffin, next.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.240
Did you hear what I said?

07:54.240 --> 07:55.600
Did you hear what I said?

07:55.600 --> 07:59.920
But that's a little laughter, but it's not any, there's no laughter.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.520
You took a big diarrhea dump on my homemade potpourri,

08:03.520 --> 08:05.520
so now I'm doing mine on yours.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.480
Hey, okay, you know what?

08:06.480 --> 08:08.160
I'm nominating my older brother Justin.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.400
He's always been there for me and my little brother Griffin.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.800
Everyone agrees he makes the best homemade potpourri in town.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.600
What's the hashtag, baby?

08:15.600 --> 08:20.320
Hashtag 20 funny challenge, and it's two zero F-U-N-N-Y challenge.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.000
How about just we drop the challenge?

08:22.000 --> 08:22.880
That's so many words.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.720
Just hashtag 20 funny.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.240
Hashtag 20 funny, this is good.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.600
All right, I think that's gonna get it out there.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.600
I mean, I could just nominate you guys.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.680
You could say something nice about me.

08:32.800 --> 08:33.840
But I'm not gonna nominate you.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.600
That doesn't make any sense.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.520
Hey, everybody, this is Griffin McElroy.

08:37.520 --> 08:38.880
This is the 20 funny challenge.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.160
Watch how high I can kick.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.360
I wanna renominate Travis McElroy.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.000
He said some dope shit about my potpourri.

08:46.000 --> 08:46.800
Didn't do a joke.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.640
Well, I figured that some people don't like doing jokes.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.080
Like my joke, my comedy-

08:52.080 --> 08:54.160
You can't change the challenge, Griffin.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.240
Well, but my comedy is more observational than that.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.200
The ice bucket challenge wasn't like dump a bucket of ice in your head

08:59.200 --> 09:01.040
or get a nice cold drink out of it.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.960
Well, I know, but my thing's a little bit more observational humor,

09:04.960 --> 09:06.560
more narrative, confessional.

09:07.120 --> 09:07.840
Pratt fall.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.600
No, it wasn't a pratt fall.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.080
I just did a really high kick and then I nominated Travis.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.640
And maybe, and he pooped his pants when he kicked too high.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.600
Yeah, I could rip a beaver or add in a beaver sound effect in there.

09:19.600 --> 09:25.680
So I think it can be like a do a joke or some sort of like, you know, light stunt.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.480
Like I don't wanna see people jumping from rooftop to rooftop.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.760
I'm talking about like, how high up can you jump?

09:31.760 --> 09:33.600
Maybe you can touch the ceiling with your fingertips.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.320
That's cool.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.800
Hey, this is Justin McElroy doing the 20 funny

09:37.440 --> 09:39.280
fill your life with laughter and love challenge.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.960
It's 20 funny challenge, fill your life with laughter and love.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.520
20 funny challenge, fill your life with laughter and love.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.720
Horse walks into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?

09:48.720 --> 09:55.360
I'm nominating Amy Adams because she brings a lot of sparkle to every movie she's in.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.280
Well, Amy's listening.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.720
So, you know, she's on board.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.640
Amy, I so appreciate you listening.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.840
Thank you so much.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.360
We're gonna begin our advice show now.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.240
Travis was on paternity leave.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.520
So I got to pick the questions.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.160
So I picked extremely long questions.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.120
That's right.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.840
We're going on some journeys and I want y'all to come with me.

10:13.840 --> 10:19.440
The irony here folks, just if I may, is as the regular question corraler,

10:20.160 --> 10:22.800
Justin's the one who's always like, oh, this is a long one.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.880
But apparently when Justin's in charge, the mice will play.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.440
You know what I mean?

10:27.440 --> 10:28.960
Yeah, the mice are playing.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.160
So I don't want you to feel like I need to charge through the whole question.

10:32.160 --> 10:37.360
If we need to take some diversions throughout, these questions can sustain.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.080
They're powerful, powerful questions.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.280
I work at a deli.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.600
Okay, let's stop there.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.320
So a deli, what is that?

10:46.320 --> 10:52.480
I work at a deli and recently a woman came in for coleslaw after we had run out.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.840
She told me that her favorite part of the coleslaw was the liquid anyway.

10:58.560 --> 11:03.040
And asked if I could put the remaining liquid into a container for her.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.120
That's risk, baby.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.160
Oh boy, challenging, challenging stuff.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.440
It's already extremely challenging.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.960
Hey everybody, this is Griffin McRoy.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.240
I'm doing the fill your life with laughter and love challenge.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.720
20 funny challenge, fill your life with laughter and love.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.800
I did a whole thing, did a whole shooter coleslaw juice.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.840
I nominate President Barack Obama.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.680
So anyway, we're gonna throw it out anyway.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.960
Anyway, so I didn't put a price sticker on it.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.960
And I told her to come back for one if the cashier gave her a hard time.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.720
I wish they had because I would love to be like, okay, let me now affix value to coleslaw juice.

11:46.720 --> 11:51.760
Let me affix monetary value to this coleslaw juice.

11:53.440 --> 11:58.000
Apparently, she was able to walk out with no problem because she came back a week later

11:58.000 --> 12:00.720
and asked for more coleslaw juice.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.520
Oh my God.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.020
Oh my God.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.520
This is how great products get started.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.760
You know, like this is how top of the muffin to you got moving.

12:09.760 --> 12:14.240
It's just the part that people like, which is apparently the juice.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.280
Well, here's what I'll say.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.800
I've never enjoyed the solid matter in the coleslaw particularly much.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.280
So maybe the juice is the least bad part of the coleslaw.

12:26.400 --> 12:31.360
This time we were not out of coleslaw, but there was only a little bit of cabbage left.

12:31.360 --> 12:36.000
I refused to give it to her for free because it was actual coleslaw.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.360
And she became upset.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.440
She told me it was barely any cabbage.

12:45.120 --> 12:48.560
Wait, consider it was really any cabbage.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.360
It said she was going to pick the cabbage out anyway.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.720
She should not pay for it.

12:55.040 --> 13:00.400
So I do want to highlight that this person came in the week before as a coleslaw fan.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.200
And then they fucking mainline coleslaw juice and realize like,

13:05.200 --> 13:09.280
I've been wasting my time with all the chewing, chewing, chewing.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.720
I need to just get the juice and do the thing I crave.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.840
You should be paying me to pick all this lettuce out.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.720
Listen, I'll come and I'll take your juice away.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.280
You won't need to worry about where your juice goes.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.160
Thanks to me and my juice removal service.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.880
So there was an argument I got into with a customer at Jimmy John's,

13:26.880 --> 13:31.440
cause we used to sell day old bread and you could get it for like a dollar.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.240
And somebody came in and wanted to buy a thing of day old bread,

13:34.240 --> 13:35.760
but we had sold all the day old bread.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.400
So they wanted to just buy regular bread for a dollar

13:38.400 --> 13:39.840
since we were out of day old.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.880
And I had to explain to them that that is not how it works.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.040
And they said, well, how old is that bread?

13:45.040 --> 13:49.600
And I think they were trying to negotiate a price based on that bread's relative age.

13:51.200 --> 13:55.120
Yeah, that's not quite as wild as free coleslaw juice,

13:55.120 --> 13:57.120
but it is certainly, we'll put it up on the leaderboard.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.640
At that point, is it still coleslaw?

13:58.640 --> 13:59.120
Like I don't-

13:59.120 --> 14:01.520
So here's, okay, wait, don't get ahead of me.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.080
I told her no, but the ensuing argument made me think,

14:04.080 --> 14:06.160
should I have charged her the first time?

14:06.160 --> 14:06.400
Yes.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.480
Should I have just given it to her the second?

14:08.480 --> 14:08.880
No.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.960
Surely if there was only one piece of cabbage in the liquid, that isn't coleslaw.

14:12.960 --> 14:13.520
Incorrect.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.280
But where is the line?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.880
What is the exact ratio of liquid to cabbage?

14:18.880 --> 14:23.760
At which point the mixture stops being slaw and isn't worth money?

14:23.760 --> 14:28.560
Also, I do not know what this woman was doing with the juice,

14:29.040 --> 14:31.440
but she said she liked it so much, quote,

14:31.840 --> 14:34.000
she could just drink it.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.360
And that's from Teresa.

14:35.360 --> 14:39.440
Then Teresa, if I may, it sounds like you know exactly what she's doing with it.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.960
I know what she's doing with it.

14:40.960 --> 14:41.920
Here's the thing.

14:41.920 --> 14:46.000
They say there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?

14:46.000 --> 14:52.080
What they don't say is what lunch is to everybody.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.320
Okay.

14:54.320 --> 14:59.760
One man's coleslaw, Levins, is another woman's lunch,

15:00.400 --> 15:05.600
and you've given her a free sort of slaw broth lunch.

15:06.480 --> 15:13.920
I don't want to get too scientifical here, but I'm going to tell you guys the issue here,

15:13.920 --> 15:16.640
and that is that we are looking at it backwards,

15:16.640 --> 15:23.280
because it is not the addition of cabbage to juice that makes it coleslaw.

15:23.840 --> 15:30.160
It is rather that we must look at it and say that the removal of the cabbage from the juice

15:30.160 --> 15:33.120
does not make it no longer coleslaw.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.320
Let me explain.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.760
You have a bowl of juice.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.840
You put one sliver of cabbage in.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.040
That is not coleslaw.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.080
What have you done?

15:40.080 --> 15:44.720
But you start with a bowl full of cabbage, right?

15:44.720 --> 15:50.160
And then slowly take some away until all of the cabbage is removed.

15:50.160 --> 15:54.960
It continues to be coleslaw until it is zero cabbage.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.040
I would say it is still coleslaw.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.080
What is that juice?

16:02.080 --> 16:05.680
I don't even know what the coleslaw is.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.760
Coleslaw is, you know, the cap.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.680
You got to have the cabbage in there, and then you're going to have mayonnaise,

16:13.680 --> 16:14.880
but mayonnaise ain't juice.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.480
Nobody's ever looked at mayonnaise and been like,

16:16.480 --> 16:19.280
I'll have some of that fatty creamy white juice, please.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.400
That's not a juice.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.240
I guess maybe there's probably a little bit of vinegar in there,

16:24.240 --> 16:26.400
but that's not what the juice is.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.440
I think it's just water.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.600
What's happening in there?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.320
Where's the water coming?

16:32.320 --> 16:36.240
Nobody's dumping a full fucking Aquafina bottle of water

16:36.240 --> 16:39.200
into some cabbage and mayonnaise and saying, now that's slaw.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.760
There's a vinegar element to this.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.520
Well, so I think what you're getting in the juice is vinegar

16:46.160 --> 16:51.120
and a little pot of mayonnaise and then like broke down,

16:52.480 --> 16:54.640
like molecules of cabbage.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.320
It's the molecules.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.640
That's what I'm thinking is the molecules.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.880
Cabbage is a very watery vegetable.

17:02.880 --> 17:03.280
Right.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.160
The breakdown of that I think is creating the water.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.040
God, coleslaw sucks so bad.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.720
It's the worst fucking food.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.560
It's like homeopathy.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.440
You're just getting like molecules of lettuce

17:15.440 --> 17:16.800
and it's supposed to help you.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.520
Hey, can I just say, Teresa,

17:20.560 --> 17:23.440
I'm not, I don't know what else you do at your job.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.200
So maybe everything else is so excellent.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.000
That's great.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.360
But you do work at a business.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.840
So next time, if you're wondering if you should charge something,

17:30.640 --> 17:33.120
like charge for something that you're giving to a customer,

17:33.120 --> 17:34.080
the answer is yes.

17:34.720 --> 17:39.040
Yes, they came in, they wanted a product.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.640
You are giving them that product.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.400
They're happy with that product.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.840
You should charge for that.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.640
All right, Travis, my brother's on the side of big deli,

17:46.640 --> 17:49.840
but I'm a team coleslaw pervert here.

17:49.840 --> 17:53.120
If people come in with these terrible needs,

17:53.120 --> 17:54.640
these terrible desires,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.280
the least you could do is support your fellow man

17:57.280 --> 17:59.600
and hook them up with as much coleslaw juice as you can.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.200
No, but that's the part they wanted.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.240
They just wanted the juice.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.560
Justin and I are over here throwing a fucking park bench

18:06.560 --> 18:08.080
through the window of that deli.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.640
We're gonna fucking smash capitalism and chug

18:10.640 --> 18:12.240
the coleslaw juice, baby.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.000
If you give away the juice for the next person

18:16.000 --> 18:17.680
is gonna have less coleslaw.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.760
And I think that's ideal for everybody.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.200
Well, there's less coleslaw for them to get.

18:21.200 --> 18:21.760
That's it.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.080
If this person comes in again, you say,

18:24.080 --> 18:27.120
go find a friend who just likes the cabbage part.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.480
And then I will separate the two into two containers

18:30.480 --> 18:32.880
and I will only charge you for one container.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.920
But I'm not giving you half.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.720
Codify it is what you're saying.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.440
And then every other non-pervert that comes in

18:41.440 --> 18:44.640
will have to stand there as you look at them

18:44.640 --> 18:46.640
straight in their human eyes and say,

18:46.640 --> 18:49.200
and how much juice would you like with that slaw?

18:49.200 --> 18:50.640
Right, yes.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.160
We juice it to order.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.120
Yes, this is bespoke juicing.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.600
Uh, that's good.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.600
It's not, it's still coleslaw at the end of the day.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.200
But do you guys want a yahoo?

19:01.200 --> 19:03.280
I like a nice dry slaw.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.520
Uh, yes.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.360
And I like it 25 feet away from me as the crow flies.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.560
A bunch of people sent this one in.

19:10.560 --> 19:10.960
Thank you.

19:10.960 --> 19:14.880
It's from yahoo answers user hockeypnc1 who asks,

19:16.080 --> 19:18.640
why does the restaurant give me such a small cup

19:18.640 --> 19:20.240
when I ask for a water cup?

19:20.240 --> 19:21.280
Don't they trust me?

19:26.400 --> 19:30.080
There's probably some sort of, you know,

19:30.080 --> 19:35.040
big capitalist energy answer for this question

19:35.040 --> 19:37.360
of just like, they don't want you to drink the water.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.920
They want you to drink the Coca-Cola.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.040
And so they want you to run out of water,

19:43.040 --> 19:46.960
see, you know, Joe six packs Coca-Cola over there

19:46.960 --> 19:50.640
and say like, well, I'm done with the clear beverage.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.320
I would like the brown beverage now.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.400
You took this a different way than I did,

19:54.400 --> 19:57.520
which I assume this was like a fountain drink scenario

19:57.520 --> 19:59.440
where I've said, I need a cup and they handed me

19:59.440 --> 20:04.000
like a tiny child's cup to get a tiny bit of water out of,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.920
can I just say the same nozzle the high sea comes out of?

20:07.920 --> 20:10.800
Come on, where's my separate water nozzle?

20:10.800 --> 20:12.880
I don't want a little bit of high sea in there.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.360
That is for sure not a hundred percent water.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.760
You're gonna get some high sea on that.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.120
But they probably do not trust you.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.560
Well, yeah, why would you?

20:24.560 --> 20:27.280
They've probably been hurt a lot before.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.520
I know, I don't think this is going on as much anymore,

20:29.520 --> 20:35.360
but there was the very terrible like YouTube prank going on,

20:35.360 --> 20:37.040
sort of the opposite of the fill your life

20:37.040 --> 20:38.400
with laughter and love challenge.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.440
There's the 20 funny challenge.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.800
Where people were ordering cups of water at drive-throughs

20:44.800 --> 20:49.520
and then eating it like directly right back into the-

20:49.520 --> 20:50.160
Yeah, baby, fucking-

20:50.160 --> 20:50.720
Yeah, rip it.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.920
That one, rip that one.

20:51.920 --> 20:52.480
Rip it.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.440
Loving it.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.560
Holy shit.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.280
Yeah, baby.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.080
Oh my God, that's a crisp one, bud.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.400
Oh, that was, did you open two at once?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.000
What was that?

21:03.520 --> 21:05.280
Double fist it.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.960
Fucking yes, baby.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.800
Coke Zero, more like Coke Hero.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.480
This one's actually a strawberry guava diet Coke.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.120
Shit, that's so gnarly.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.440
Okay, so that's not good.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.640
It was bad that they did that.

21:18.640 --> 21:23.680
So maybe that sort of meant that just mankind could not be

21:23.680 --> 21:26.000
trusted with water going through a drive-through.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.480
I do this to my kids.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.640
You don't trust your kids?

21:30.640 --> 21:32.320
I don't trust my kids with a larger cup

21:32.320 --> 21:34.640
than I care to clean up with a paper towel.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.040
Yes.

21:35.040 --> 21:39.280
I have to envision everything I hand to my child upended on the floor.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.720
And so I don't give them any, it's my fault at that point.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.000
If I have to clean up something larger

21:44.000 --> 21:46.480
than a very small cup of water, that's on me.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.040
This is how I feel every time my daughter

21:49.040 --> 21:53.040
sees me drinking something in an adult sized cup

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
and says, I would like a drink of that.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.880
And then I try to help her and she says no.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.520
And I think, well, there's the rest of my day gone.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.240
That's my day.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.960
I think that all the cups should be smaller.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.600
I think if you go to an Applebee's

22:07.600 --> 22:09.360
and they give you a smaller water cup,

22:09.360 --> 22:11.840
this is not a thing that happens at any chain restaurant.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.440
This is only fast food, yes?

22:14.000 --> 22:14.240
Yeah.

22:14.880 --> 22:15.520
Okay.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.120
Well, because at the chain restaurant,

22:17.120 --> 22:19.680
they don't want to have to keep sending someone over there

22:19.680 --> 22:22.080
as you're taking shots of H2O.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.840
That's a good point, Travis.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.320
Okay, well, when I'm at the fast food restaurant,

22:26.320 --> 22:28.400
I'm just saying, have you seen the size

22:28.400 --> 22:29.520
of some of these sodas?

22:30.400 --> 22:31.200
They're pretty big.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.320
Can I also throw this out?

22:32.320 --> 22:33.040
Here we go.

22:33.040 --> 22:33.920
Are you kidding me?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.920
I gotta hear more about these big sodas.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.520
Okay, Griffin, go on in the background

22:37.520 --> 22:39.040
while I make my point.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.760
My car started to drag its front end

22:41.760 --> 22:43.840
and flipped upside down.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.520
And I have to drive and work upside down.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.880
I think that not only should all cups be smaller,

22:48.880 --> 22:50.160
I agree with you, Griffin.

22:50.160 --> 22:54.560
I think also, taking a note from the water cooler design,

22:54.560 --> 22:56.160
all cups should be conical

22:56.160 --> 22:58.560
so that we cannot set them down.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.480
You either finish it while you're holding it

23:00.480 --> 23:01.600
or you throw it away.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.840
That is brutalist office design.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.960
I've never thought of that.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.040
Are they conical so you can't set them down?

23:11.040 --> 23:13.520
There's no other reason, Justin.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.120
It's a literal spike.

23:15.680 --> 23:18.400
It's an actual spike.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.120
That's what Hellraiser drinks out of.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.040
I just assumed they were cheaper to produce,

23:23.040 --> 23:24.320
but there is something about like,

23:24.320 --> 23:26.080
I don't want fucking cups everywhere.

23:26.080 --> 23:26.720
Here you go.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.080
Now you have to throw them away.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.320
You gotta finish it and throw it away.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.920
Or turn it into a fun bird beak.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.560
Or a tiny dunce cap.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.200
Fun hat.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.440
A little crown of a bad kingdom.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.240
That's pretty good.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.000
I'm just saying some of these cups are so big

23:42.000 --> 23:43.520
I fell in one and drowned once.

23:43.520 --> 23:47.440
I am a law school student living in a pretty okay apartment

23:47.440 --> 23:49.440
and I've been in this apartment since I started law school

23:49.440 --> 23:50.800
about a year and a half ago.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.120
My landlord has been pretty okay up until now,

23:53.120 --> 23:54.880
but he just did something that has blown my mind.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.440
I asked him to fix my sink

23:58.240 --> 24:00.000
because it was leaking from the bottom.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.280
And he said he'd do it during a time when I'd be in class.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.680
Past experience told me this is fine, so I'll let it happen.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.880
I come back to my apartment and the sink is sitting on top

24:09.920 --> 24:11.280
of a folded pizza box.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.200
Of a folded pizza box.

24:13.200 --> 24:13.840
Wait, what?

24:13.840 --> 24:14.560
It's the-

24:14.560 --> 24:16.880
Of a folded pizza box.

24:16.880 --> 24:17.920
How could that be true?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.880
It's fixed, but brothers, I have no idea

24:20.880 --> 24:22.800
where this pizza box came from.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.360
Wait.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.320
Did he bring it with him?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.480
I haven't eaten pizza in two months.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.320
What do I make of this?

24:28.320 --> 24:29.680
That's from Cassie in Albany.

24:29.680 --> 24:33.200
Did he fix the sink by putting a pizza box under it?

24:33.200 --> 24:36.720
What it sounds like to me is he fixed the sink.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.400
To catch the drippings?

24:40.400 --> 24:43.200
I'm trying to work through,

24:43.200 --> 24:45.280
here's what I think might be happening here.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.040
Is that the folded pizza box is sort of like

24:49.040 --> 24:54.800
underneath the basin and it's sort of like pushing it up.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.720
This is not how it, this is not what this question means.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.760
That can't possibly, that can't be it.

25:02.720 --> 25:07.760
It's just, I don't know how you, it's leaking.

25:07.760 --> 25:08.400
Uh-huh.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.520
Right, so just squish a pizza box under there.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.360
That's how a kindergartner would fix it.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.240
Yeah, this is, Cassie, if I may,

25:16.960 --> 25:19.360
there's two words in here that do not go

25:19.360 --> 25:20.880
with the rest of the question.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.120
You can't say it's sitting on top of a pizza box

25:23.120 --> 25:26.640
and it's fixed, it's fixed.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.720
I think it's two separate ideas.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.000
Okay.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.320
I think the landlord ordered a hot and ready

25:34.320 --> 25:38.560
and treated themselves to it as they did the dirty sink work.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.320
And they were embarrassed that they ate a pizza

25:40.320 --> 25:42.800
in your house, so rather than put it in your trash can,

25:42.800 --> 25:45.040
they folded it up and jammed it under your sink,

25:45.040 --> 25:48.960
and in doing so, somehow fixed the leak.

25:48.960 --> 25:52.080
They didn't fix it, you're going at this with like

25:52.080 --> 25:54.960
wild LucasArts adventure game logic.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.600
Nobody's ever used pizza box on sink.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.360
But Griffin, okay, I come back to my apartment

26:01.360 --> 26:07.440
and the sink is sitting on top of a folded pizza box.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.680
There's no room for daylight there.

26:09.680 --> 26:14.720
The sink is somehow sitting atop a folded pizza box.

26:14.720 --> 26:18.480
And then let me see next two words, it's fixed.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.240
There's just the reason I put it,

26:20.240 --> 26:23.840
there's one still image in the world

26:23.840 --> 26:26.240
that maybe Cassie captured, maybe they didn't,

26:26.240 --> 26:29.280
that makes this all go away.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.000
There's just one picture that would congeal

26:32.000 --> 26:35.200
the entire situation of my mind, and I cannot conceive of it.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.560
The sink was too low.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.120
So it was leaking.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.400
So it leaked, sinks are very, very particular.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.360
How about another question?

26:43.360 --> 26:47.680
Well, I have a new segment I would like to try.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.520
Oh wow, okay.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.320
I was away for some time, and this is, listen,

26:52.320 --> 26:53.760
this one's a little more straightforward,

26:53.760 --> 26:55.360
there's not a big goof here,

26:55.360 --> 26:58.160
but I wanted something everyone could participate in.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.640
So I called this segment, Play Along at Home.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.520
Oh, hello, didn't see it come in there.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.760
I'm about to ask my brothers, Justin and Griffin,

27:05.760 --> 27:08.800
some questions, why don't you play along at home?

27:10.960 --> 27:11.760
Are you guys ready?

27:13.040 --> 27:14.160
You need us for this too?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.240
I thought the listeners were taking our role.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.880
No, you're here, no, you guys are gonna try to answer.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.800
I was gonna follow their lead.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.400
No, they play along at home.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.560
They don't play first at home, they play at home.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.200
Is this like a sparring in fifth grader,

27:27.200 --> 27:28.640
like you're gonna embarrass us?

27:28.640 --> 27:29.360
No, no, no, no.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.000
These are just some very straightforward questions,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.840
and it sounds like they're not from the way I said that,

27:33.840 --> 27:34.880
but they are very straightforward.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.800
Can I ask one last question?

27:37.520 --> 27:38.720
Are you getting these questions

27:38.720 --> 27:41.680
from some sort of disreputable website?

27:41.680 --> 27:42.960
No, I made these questions up.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.280
This is a straightforward, legitimate quiz.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.760
In the song, It Wasn't Me,

27:48.480 --> 27:52.240
how many times is the phrase, it wasn't me, spoken?

27:52.240 --> 27:56.720
Huh, probably an even number, I would guess.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.480
That makes sense.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.080
I'm gonna say 32 times.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.120
Justin.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.640
Wow, I'm actually gonna say 18 times.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.200
Ooh, Justin's the closest, it's 15 times.

28:07.200 --> 28:07.680
Oh, it's not.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.880
It wasn't an even time, because once, in one line,

28:12.160 --> 28:14.080
the non-Shaggy singer says,

28:14.080 --> 28:16.320
how is she supposed to believe it wasn't me?

28:17.440 --> 28:21.280
Oh, and at one point, Shaggy does say, it was not me.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.560
It was not me.

28:22.560 --> 28:26.880
If you check the records, of the United States,

28:27.680 --> 28:32.400
how many state names have more vowels than consonants?

28:33.440 --> 28:33.940
Five.

28:35.520 --> 28:35.920
Justin.

28:37.040 --> 28:37.920
I'm gonna say eight.

28:38.480 --> 28:38.960
10.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.600
Team.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.480
Eight, eight.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.040
10.

28:41.040 --> 28:46.240
Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa,

28:46.240 --> 28:48.720
Louisiana, Maine, and Ohio.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.720
Cool, I'm comedy rule of threes.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.320
Come on, third one's gonna be super fun.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.320
How many times, altogether,

28:56.320 --> 29:00.320
did I see the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise in theaters?

29:01.200 --> 29:01.760
14.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.760
12.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.880
Justin, you are correct.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.880
I saw the first one, Curse of the Black Pearl,

29:08.880 --> 29:10.240
nine times in theaters.

29:11.040 --> 29:15.280
I saw two, three, and four once in theaters,

29:15.280 --> 29:17.520
and saw the fifth one on a plane.

29:17.520 --> 29:22.240
I hope my prize is a joke from you.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.640
Okay, one more, one more question.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.880
If you were to stand Travis's end to end,

29:29.840 --> 29:32.720
how many Travis's would you need to be taller

29:32.720 --> 29:34.320
than the Empire State Building?

29:35.680 --> 29:38.400
I feel like we're on a fucking car trip right now,

29:39.120 --> 29:41.040
and I just like picked up-

29:41.040 --> 29:42.080
How many Travis's?

29:42.080 --> 29:44.400
If you stood Travis's end to end,

29:45.040 --> 29:46.080
how many Travis's would you need-

29:46.080 --> 29:50.480
It's like I'm reading a highlights zine made by Travis.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.480
To be taller than the Empire State-

29:52.480 --> 29:55.200
I also had a question here about Shakespeare shows,

29:55.200 --> 29:56.880
but I edited that one for time.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.200
For time.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.040
I might throw it in if we have a tie.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.040
I would say 220 Travis's.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.000
Okay, Griffin?

30:06.800 --> 30:09.600
I'm gonna say 221 Travis's.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.600
Oh, it's 250 Travis's.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.400
Griffin is correct.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.880
Eat my ass, Justin, booyah.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.400
You fell in my trap.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.520
Thank you, no thank you.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.120
I think in this circumstance, yeah,

30:21.120 --> 30:22.720
three out of four Justin was closest.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.080
Congratulations, Justin.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.600
You won the first of I'm sure many play along at home.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.360
Okay, well, that was funny.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.960
And now the money's out.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.720
Let's not go to the money zone.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.400
I think we need to debrief.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.760
And I'll cut the, don't worry, Trav.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.120
I'll cut the debrief out of the show starting right here.

30:45.840 --> 30:49.440
That clap was for me to see when to start cutting it.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.200
Well, Griffin, let me explain to you.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.000
It's fun because-

30:52.000 --> 30:52.640
Yeah, do it, man.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.640
Just explain your whole concept for it

30:54.640 --> 30:56.800
because we're not in the show anymore, definitely.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.400
So often the things we do on the show are just for us

31:00.400 --> 31:02.160
and we have a good time doing them,

31:02.160 --> 31:03.760
but are the people at home enjoying it?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.600
I thought, and so I thought this time

31:05.600 --> 31:07.440
they could play along at home.

31:07.440 --> 31:07.760
Right.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.080
So you created, hold on, sorry.

31:10.080 --> 31:13.600
I just need to clarify something.

31:13.600 --> 31:17.280
Your intent with this was a way to help listeners

31:17.280 --> 31:20.880
pass the time while they listened to our show.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.240
We were opening the door and saying,

31:22.240 --> 31:24.160
hey, come on inside and play along at home.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.440
Just to give them a break from the comedy,

31:27.440 --> 31:33.120
you wanted to give them like a coloring mat at Applebee's.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.360
When you watch kids TV, right?

31:35.360 --> 31:37.520
Every so often the people on the show

31:37.520 --> 31:39.600
will stop what they're doing and turn towards the audience

31:39.600 --> 31:41.360
and be like, which one's the square?

31:41.360 --> 31:43.680
I thought it would be nice if we included a moment like that

31:43.680 --> 31:44.560
where someone would be like,

31:44.560 --> 31:47.280
I helped the brothers figure out how many times

31:47.280 --> 31:50.800
Travis saw Pirates of the Caribbean franchise in theaters.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.760
We should be giving the listeners some sort of puzzle.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.560
That's a good point because not all of them like it.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.960
And also we keep getting calls from the police like,

31:59.520 --> 32:01.280
we got another dead body here.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.880
They laughed too much at the show, too constantly

32:04.880 --> 32:07.360
that they forgot to fucking breathe again.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.360
So if you could start adding in a segment

32:09.360 --> 32:14.800
that would be guaranteed a time for people-

32:14.800 --> 32:16.560
By design, I would say.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.640
Guaranteed a time to do some deep contemplative breathing.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.960
Yeah, well, here's the thing Griffin,

32:22.960 --> 32:25.440
we're not supposed to fill our lives with laughter or love.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.160
So here's the love part of the show.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.880
The love part is that Travis has provided,

32:30.880 --> 32:32.640
the love part is that Travis has provided

32:32.640 --> 32:36.160
a sort of chill out tip right in the middle of our podcast.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.480
It's not all about goof, if it's all goofs-

32:38.480 --> 32:40.640
It is, it's a fucking comedy show.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.400
But it can't all be peaks, Griffin.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.600
There's gotta be fucking valleys.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.480
Oh, sorry.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.320
So you admit it's a valley.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.800
No, but it's a restful time

32:48.800 --> 32:50.480
where everyone can play along at home.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.520
It's a chill restful valley, like a little hammock.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.360
So they can play along at home.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.320
Hanging between two listenable podcast trees.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.800
Yes, it's a chance to play along at home.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.240
But when people laugh at our baller jokes,

33:06.240 --> 33:10.320
that is a way of playing along at home, Travis.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.520
No, no.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.520
Where's the chance for them to yell at the screen

33:13.520 --> 33:17.360
like in Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune, right?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.440
They're laughing along with us

33:19.440 --> 33:21.520
and while we're like, everybody loves Raymond.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.960
That's great, everybody loves that.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.080
Everybody loves Raymond.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.440
But then where's the point for them

33:25.440 --> 33:27.520
to feel superior to you guys?

33:28.400 --> 33:32.160
Right, like the RPG element, right, yeah.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.200
Thank you for bringing interactivity to the program, Travis.

33:35.200 --> 33:35.840
You're welcome.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.040
It's a grand slam.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.320
And with that, we will squire everyone away

33:40.320 --> 33:41.360
to the Money Zone.

33:41.360 --> 33:53.680
We got a new sponsor this week.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.160
What?

33:54.160 --> 33:55.760
A new, yes.

33:55.760 --> 34:00.160
So we're new to talk about, it's Honey Book.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.360
It sounds nice, doesn't it?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.160
It does sound nice.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.840
Is it just a book full of honey?

34:03.840 --> 34:06.720
It is a business management tool.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.600
You got in, you started your artisanal donut shop

34:11.600 --> 34:14.160
to make artisanal donuts and create new recipes,

34:14.160 --> 34:14.800
I'm assuming.

34:14.800 --> 34:15.840
Yes, I did.

34:15.840 --> 34:19.280
So Travis, you shouldn't waste a bunch of time

34:19.280 --> 34:21.680
doing garbage that you don't wanna do

34:21.680 --> 34:23.840
and Honey Book helps with that.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.600
It helps you automate your busy work.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.480
They got templates for emails, proposals,

34:28.480 --> 34:30.480
brochures, invoices.

34:30.480 --> 34:34.080
It organizes your communications with your clients,

34:34.080 --> 34:36.320
your bookings, contracts, and invoices.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.200
It's all one place.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.920
It just makes running a small business that much easier

34:39.920 --> 34:41.680
so you don't have to mess around with all the whack,

34:41.680 --> 34:43.040
boring stuff that you don't care about.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.160
Justin, hey, Justin.

34:44.160 --> 34:44.640
Yeah?

34:44.640 --> 34:46.560
Can Honey Book teach me how to make donuts?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.040
This is a problem.

34:49.040 --> 34:49.680
Because I invested-

34:49.680 --> 34:52.000
Right now, can I be honest with you guys?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.120
I don't mean to freak you out.

34:53.120 --> 34:58.720
I invested all of our podcast money into this donut business

34:58.720 --> 34:59.920
because I love donuts.

34:59.920 --> 35:00.560
You know that.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.280
Right, yeah.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.400
What was the name of it again?

35:02.400 --> 35:03.600
Of the donut business?

35:03.600 --> 35:04.320
Holes to Me.

35:05.680 --> 35:06.640
Holes to Me.

35:06.640 --> 35:07.600
Yeah, right.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.720
It was going off of like, it's all holes to me, but like-

35:10.720 --> 35:13.040
I thought we were gonna call it Holes On for one more day.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.600
Oh, that's right, that is better.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.960
What about Holes Your Horses?

35:18.240 --> 35:22.080
Well, that sounds like we're gonna hurt horses, which I-

35:22.080 --> 35:24.720
I thought we were gonna call it Donut on My Breakfast.

35:24.720 --> 35:30.480
Oh, no.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.120
How about Donut November?

35:33.120 --> 35:35.600
Right now, Honey Book is canceling all their other ads with us,

35:35.600 --> 35:39.440
but also right now, Honey Book is offering our listeners 50% off

35:39.440 --> 35:41.920
when you try honeybook.com slash my brother.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.120
Payment is flexible.

35:43.120 --> 35:46.160
This promotion applies whether you pay monthly or annually.

35:46.160 --> 35:51.520
Go to tryhoneybook.com slash my brother for 50% off your first year.

35:51.520 --> 35:55.200
That's tryhoneybook.com slash my brother.

35:56.000 --> 36:02.400
Hey, are you sad because you can't get Donut on My Breakfast right at home?

36:02.400 --> 36:03.920
You wake up and you're just-

36:03.920 --> 36:06.000
You're not feeling putting on your big boy pants,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.240
but you really want some Donut on My Breakfast.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.160
Well, maybe think about getting up on DoorDash.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.200
I don't think they work with Donut on My Breakfast because-

36:15.200 --> 36:15.600
Not yet.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.720
It's fictional, and also I think that they have standards,

36:18.720 --> 36:25.200
but they do work with over 340,000 restaurants in 3300 cities

36:25.200 --> 36:30.000
to get food delivered to your home when you use the DoorDash app.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.520
You just pick what you want to eat,

36:31.520 --> 36:34.080
and food will be delivered to you wherever you are.

36:34.080 --> 36:38.160
Oh my God, you guys, even as we're recording this segment,

36:38.160 --> 36:40.560
the orders are flooding in from DoorDash.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.000
My business is saved.

36:42.000 --> 36:42.560
Hey.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.840
Thank you, DoorDash.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.200
You know what I like about DoorDash?

36:45.200 --> 36:45.760
What?

36:45.760 --> 36:49.120
DoorDash, I try to eat healthier.

36:49.120 --> 36:49.760
It's the beginning of the year.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.720
I'm sure a lot of people are.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.920
And a lot of times I just don't feel like the extra work it takes

36:53.920 --> 36:55.360
to cook something healthy.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.480
And in those situations, DoorDash is great

36:58.480 --> 37:00.960
because you can order ahead of time,

37:00.960 --> 37:03.200
get something healthy delivered right to you,

37:03.200 --> 37:04.480
and you don't have to put in all the work

37:04.480 --> 37:05.440
of actually making something.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.960
Also, not just to your house,

37:06.960 --> 37:08.480
because I've been out at bars before,

37:08.480 --> 37:10.720
got there and found out they didn't serve food,

37:10.720 --> 37:11.600
and I was starving.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.440
I've DoorDashed to a bar before.

37:13.440 --> 37:13.920
What's up?

37:13.920 --> 37:14.960
Not close.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.400
That's pretty cool stuff.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.160
Right now our listeners can get $5

37:18.160 --> 37:20.320
off their first order of $15 or more.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.920
When you download the DoorDash app

37:21.920 --> 37:23.600
and enter the promo code MYBROTHER,

37:23.600 --> 37:25.920
all one word, that's $5 off your first order.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.240
When you download the DoorDash app from the App Store

37:28.240 --> 37:29.920
and enter promo code MYBROTHER,

37:29.920 --> 37:31.600
one last time, promo code MYBROTHER

37:31.600 --> 37:34.560
for $5 off your first order from DoorDash.

37:34.560 --> 37:35.280
Hey, Jake Heath.

37:35.280 --> 37:35.840
Hey, Helen.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.160
I hear you have a true-false quiz you want me to finish.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.040
I do.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.640
Here we begin.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.880
We host a trivia game show podcast

37:42.880 --> 37:45.920
on the Max Fun Network called Go Fact Yourself.

37:45.920 --> 37:46.400
True.

37:46.400 --> 37:46.960
Correct.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.800
The show is all about celebrity guests

37:48.800 --> 37:52.160
answering trivia questions about things Jake Heath enjoys.

37:52.160 --> 37:52.560
False.

37:52.560 --> 37:54.880
We sometimes don't talk about baseball or cats.

37:54.880 --> 37:55.840
Thank God.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.240
It's questions about things they enjoy.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.360
Next, we bring on surprise experts every episode.

38:01.360 --> 38:01.760
True.

38:01.760 --> 38:02.240
Correct.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.280
Final question.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.000
It's just the two of us sitting alone with these guests.

38:06.000 --> 38:06.480
False.

38:06.480 --> 38:06.960
Correct.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.600
We have a live audience at the Angel City Brewery.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.240
See?

38:12.240 --> 38:15.040
You can hear Go Fact Yourself every first and third Friday

38:15.040 --> 38:15.600
of the month.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.960
And if you don't listen, you can go fact yourself.

38:18.960 --> 38:19.460
True.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.840
I want to munch!

38:29.840 --> 38:30.340
Squad!

38:33.200 --> 38:35.120
I want to munch!

38:35.120 --> 38:35.620
Squad!

38:35.620 --> 38:40.020
Squad!

38:40.020 --> 38:42.980
I want to read one headline, and it's just,

38:42.980 --> 38:47.140
Chuck E. Cheese's parent names David McKillop's CEO.

38:47.140 --> 38:49.300
I just think it's weird that Chuck E. Cheese lets his dad

38:49.300 --> 38:53.860
pick who's going to run the company.

38:53.860 --> 38:56.580
I'm Charles F. Cheese, the kingmaker.

38:58.180 --> 38:58.980
So, right.

38:58.980 --> 39:00.740
So, OK.

39:00.740 --> 39:03.460
So, Mr. Peanut died.

39:03.460 --> 39:03.940
Yeah, I knew it.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.140
I fucking knew it.

39:05.140 --> 39:05.940
Is this played?

39:07.220 --> 39:10.580
Mr. Peanut died saving the lives of Matt Walsh.

39:10.580 --> 39:11.220
And what's this?

39:11.220 --> 39:12.180
So random.

39:12.980 --> 39:13.860
It's so random.

39:13.860 --> 39:15.140
It's like, I saw it.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.260
I saw the news.

39:16.260 --> 39:19.860
New York Times front page, big font, top of the headline.

39:19.860 --> 39:22.820
And I was like, fucking random, dude.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.900
I saw the news, and I thought, good.

39:25.460 --> 39:26.900
Eat the rich, you know?

39:27.460 --> 39:29.380
With his monocle, his top hat.

39:30.260 --> 39:31.860
Well, he's also a nut.

39:31.860 --> 39:34.260
So you could chomp down right on him.

39:34.260 --> 39:38.900
But can I say something, though?

39:39.860 --> 39:40.420
Yeah.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.700
Is it about how random it is?

39:41.700 --> 39:42.500
It's random.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.540
We've covered that.

39:43.540 --> 39:44.820
Can I say what else?

39:44.820 --> 39:45.380
What?

39:45.380 --> 39:47.620
It's fucking twisted, dude.

39:47.620 --> 39:48.820
It is twisted.

39:48.820 --> 39:49.940
That's their guy.

39:50.660 --> 39:54.980
That's their whole guy, and he's been in all the commercials.

39:54.980 --> 39:57.140
And they're like, what are we going to do for the big game?

39:59.780 --> 40:01.780
Let's kill Mr. Peanut.

40:01.780 --> 40:06.340
It ends with a card that says Mr. Peanut, 1916 to 2020.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.100
Because he's 104 years old, and he died.

40:08.740 --> 40:13.380
And I just wanted to point out that this is an ad that ran before the Super Bowl.

40:15.540 --> 40:21.540
This press release, one, details exactly what happens in that, in prose.

40:22.100 --> 40:23.380
The entirety of that.

40:23.940 --> 40:24.500
You can see it.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.060
They're all in a car.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.980
It's the novelization of the commercial.

40:26.980 --> 40:28.580
It's a new concept.

40:28.580 --> 40:32.900
Yep, last year, Mr. Peanut saved friends from snacking disappointment.

40:32.900 --> 40:34.580
This year, he's saving lives.

40:34.580 --> 40:39.700
The newly released pregame ad shows Mr. Peanut, Matt Walsh, and Wesley Snipes are on a nutty

40:39.700 --> 40:43.780
adventure in the Nutmobile, where Mr. Peanut is forced to swerve, causing the vehicle to

40:43.780 --> 40:44.900
spin out of control.

40:44.900 --> 40:48.820
The trio jumps out of the Nutmobile, clinging onto a tree branch, as the vehicle crashes

40:48.820 --> 40:50.820
down into a deep canyon below.

40:50.820 --> 40:54.260
They momentarily find safety until their combined weight begins to break the branch.

40:54.260 --> 40:58.100
In the ultimate act of friendship, Mr. Peanut lets go and sacrifices himself

40:58.100 --> 40:59.780
to save his friends from impending doom.

40:59.780 --> 41:00.580
Yeah, he does.

41:00.580 --> 41:06.100
And then it says you can watch him die in this video.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.060
You can watch him die.

41:07.780 --> 41:09.540
And they're going to show that in the pregame.

41:09.540 --> 41:14.900
And then the brand's official Super Bowl commercial will air in the third quarter of the game

41:14.900 --> 41:16.900
and broadcast Mr. Peanut's funeral.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.500
Oh, funny, funny.

41:19.300 --> 41:21.140
That's going to be fucking funny.

41:21.140 --> 41:25.380
And then, but then can we just, he is going to smash out of the grave, right?

41:25.380 --> 41:29.540
I mean, he's got to smash out of the grave with like a new look.

41:29.540 --> 41:31.220
Guys, I think he's really fucking dead.

41:31.220 --> 41:35.140
I think he needs fucking toast, dude.

41:35.140 --> 41:39.060
I saw him fall down and I saw the car explode and I think he's really fucking dead, you guys.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.980
There's no getting out of this one.

41:40.980 --> 41:44.020
That brand mascot is dead as hell.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.140
I don't see him coming back.

41:45.140 --> 41:46.900
I think he's fucking dead as shit.

41:46.900 --> 41:53.780
The fact that Mr. Peanut fell 100 miles into a huge ravine and Wesley Snipes didn't say

41:53.780 --> 41:59.620
and me without my jelly is probably the biggest comedy tragedy of this generation,

41:59.620 --> 42:01.060
or perhaps any other.

42:01.060 --> 42:01.380
Can I?

42:03.060 --> 42:09.540
I want to float them in the limits in everyone's mind of logging into Twitter someday in the

42:09.540 --> 42:15.860
morning and seeing the breaking news that actor-comedian Matt Walsh has died saving

42:15.860 --> 42:20.900
Wesley Snipes and Mr. Peanut in a car accident.

42:20.900 --> 42:27.780
Well, no, because it'll be Mr. Peanut and then then Matt Walsh and then Wesley Snipes

42:27.780 --> 42:30.340
who have won the tontine and he'll get all the money.

42:30.340 --> 42:31.220
Okay, see, yes.

42:32.660 --> 42:37.620
So it's going to be a really funny funeral for this beloved peanut who has lived longer

42:37.620 --> 42:41.060
than pretty much anybody on earth and then we killed him because that's what we do.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.740
I wanted to hear about his family at the lake.

42:45.620 --> 42:47.060
They got smashed.

42:47.060 --> 42:47.940
What does that mean?

42:47.940 --> 42:48.820
Because they're peanuts.

42:48.820 --> 42:50.820
Smashed peanuts?

42:50.820 --> 42:52.100
Like that great treat, smashed peanuts?

42:52.100 --> 42:54.180
Because they get turned into peanut butter.

42:55.700 --> 42:58.340
Okay, that you're nothing.

42:58.340 --> 43:02.020
Air whooshed into peanut butter.

43:02.020 --> 43:02.580
Fans who-

43:02.580 --> 43:03.300
No, hold up.

43:03.300 --> 43:08.260
Wait, Travis started doing like a Mr. Evil impression accent and that's when it was

43:08.260 --> 43:09.060
getting good for me.

43:09.060 --> 43:13.140
So again, but as Mr. Peanut Butter.

43:13.140 --> 43:13.780
I love it.

43:15.700 --> 43:17.620
Say something else as Mr. Evil.

43:17.620 --> 43:19.060
Justin, shut the fuck up.

43:19.060 --> 43:20.660
One million dollars.

43:23.700 --> 43:28.420
In addition to mourning Mr. Peanut during his funeral, fans have several ways to celebrate

43:28.420 --> 43:34.020
his life, including fans who spot the nutmobile leading up to and on game day will receive

43:34.020 --> 43:36.500
a commemorative pin celebrating Mr. Peanut's life.

43:36.500 --> 43:39.300
Hey y'all, I know that motherfucker's dead.

43:39.300 --> 43:43.060
If I see the nutmobile driving around, I'm going to freak.

43:43.060 --> 43:46.340
Also, if I get a pin and then find out he's not dead,

43:46.340 --> 43:48.980
I'm going to feel like a real asshole.

43:50.180 --> 43:54.340
Mr. Peanut enthusiasts can show their family and friends how much the legume meant to them

43:55.460 --> 44:02.180
by sharing the black crying monocle and their favorite memory on social using hashtag repeanut.

44:02.180 --> 44:05.380
I feel like they're not taking this seriously.

44:05.380 --> 44:07.780
They're like making a big fucking joke out of it.

44:07.780 --> 44:08.820
A man has died.

44:08.820 --> 44:11.940
Yeah, a man has died and he may be a peanut butter man.

44:11.940 --> 44:16.180
And, but I mean, just because he was a peanut doesn't mean his memory needs to be assaulted.

44:17.620 --> 44:19.460
The ad was produced by-

44:19.460 --> 44:20.820
Was that another peanut joke?

44:21.940 --> 44:22.820
No, sir.

44:22.820 --> 44:25.300
Okay, who do you wish had died-

44:25.300 --> 44:26.260
In that three?

44:26.260 --> 44:26.900
In that three.

44:26.900 --> 44:27.220
I mean, Mr. Peanut.

44:27.220 --> 44:28.100
Fuck a merry kill.

44:30.580 --> 44:36.980
Can I just say though, I am really glad they were filming when the car crash happened.

44:36.980 --> 44:42.180
Cause if he had just died, like if he had just died, if he had had a heart attack and just died,

44:42.180 --> 44:46.340
and then we see it in the news, they like smell rotten peanut coming from his hotel room or

44:46.340 --> 44:49.460
something like five days later, like that would have been sad.

44:49.460 --> 44:52.340
But at least they were recording on tape.

44:52.340 --> 44:53.460
Yeah, they got a commercial out of it.

44:53.460 --> 44:56.100
They recorded it when he died and exploded.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.260
So now I feel like I get a chance to say goodbye.

44:58.980 --> 45:03.060
I just want to say that there's no combination of the three of them in which I don't end up

45:03.060 --> 45:04.820
choosing Mr. Peanut for kill.

45:04.820 --> 45:06.260
Not for kill.

45:06.260 --> 45:11.140
Yeah, cause he's, and the reason for that is that he doesn't have flesh and bone and blood

45:11.140 --> 45:13.940
and brain and organs and cells and nerves.

45:15.300 --> 45:21.700
Brand Twitter fucking jizzed all over itself trying to get a slice of this one.

45:21.700 --> 45:24.420
Everybody's tweeting about this, this tale.

45:25.460 --> 45:30.500
I think the most hypocritical one is Snickers who said,

45:30.500 --> 45:34.980
we too would sacrifice it all for the nut. Hashtag RIP Nut.

45:35.540 --> 45:43.620
And hey fucking Snickers, you've been burying his brethren for decades in people's maws.

45:43.620 --> 45:47.860
I don't know where you get off being indignant about the loss of one peanut when you've been

45:47.860 --> 45:50.100
absolutely murdering them for ages.

45:50.100 --> 45:50.740
I think-

45:50.740 --> 45:56.740
PETA said that nuts have been a great source of protein for a long time.

45:56.740 --> 45:59.060
Whoa, shut the fuck up.

45:59.060 --> 46:02.820
You can't even, we're trying to have fun over here with this dead ass nut.

46:02.820 --> 46:05.460
And you come in here like, well, let me tell you about the body science.

46:06.580 --> 46:12.500
So Uno, the brand Uno of the game, you know the game Uno?

46:12.500 --> 46:17.700
So that brand replied to the other brand, which is now, I will give it up.

46:17.700 --> 46:22.900
The Twitter name of Mr. Peanut has changed to the estate of Mr. Peanut.

46:22.900 --> 46:24.180
Yeah, that does rule.

46:24.180 --> 46:25.860
That is extremely good.

46:25.860 --> 46:29.780
I will give you your proper respect for that.

46:29.780 --> 46:34.660
Uno replied to the tweet, what?

46:34.660 --> 46:39.060
No, we're dropping a reverse card on this. Hashtag RIP Nut.

46:39.060 --> 46:41.940
Hey Uno, can I talk to you over here for a second?

46:42.900 --> 46:44.340
It's 2020.

46:44.340 --> 46:50.180
If you have had the ability to drop reverse cards on events of the world,

46:50.180 --> 46:55.220
I do not know why you've been on the fucking bench until now.

46:55.220 --> 46:59.140
I can't believe this is against you in the fucking game, Uno.

47:00.900 --> 47:02.740
You must have just drawn it, I hope.

47:02.740 --> 47:05.940
Because if you have had this ability this entire time,

47:05.940 --> 47:08.980
and this is where you say this far, no far.

47:08.980 --> 47:13.700
Listen guys, we only have enough chrono silk to operate the time loom once.

47:14.420 --> 47:15.780
So we, and we've been waiting.

47:15.780 --> 47:18.260
I think Mr. Peanut's the one we got to burn it on.

47:19.300 --> 47:21.220
If you're already got the reverse card going,

47:21.220 --> 47:23.860
if you could just let it run for a few years,

47:23.860 --> 47:26.900
I would love another second, another pass at this.

47:28.740 --> 47:31.540
Very, very well done, Peanut Company.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.300
Can I do a Yahoo?

47:33.940 --> 47:34.660
Yes.

47:34.660 --> 47:35.220
Yeah, please.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.740
It was sent in by Kevin. Thanks, Kevin.

47:36.740 --> 47:38.260
It's anonymous Yahoo answers user.

47:38.260 --> 47:40.100
I'm gonna call Mr. Peanut out of respect.

47:41.460 --> 47:44.020
Does the washing machine in a home slash apartment

47:44.020 --> 47:46.740
share the same water that comes out of the toilet?

47:47.780 --> 47:50.340
Now I think that this person's probably smart enough to know

47:50.340 --> 47:52.740
that you don't flush your dirty toilet water down

47:52.740 --> 47:55.540
and then it goes back up into the washing machine

47:56.180 --> 47:59.540
because I've certainly done both at the same time before

47:59.540 --> 48:01.460
and like, I know that's not how it works.

48:02.260 --> 48:08.660
But I guess I'm confused about what the flow direction,

48:08.660 --> 48:10.980
like, is there one big pipe

48:10.980 --> 48:14.260
and this pipe would be called like Griffin's water pipe

48:14.260 --> 48:16.020
and then whenever I turn on washing machine,

48:16.020 --> 48:18.660
Griffin's water pipe is like, let's get some water up there.

48:18.660 --> 48:19.140
Yes.

48:19.140 --> 48:21.140
But then Griffin's downstairs toilet pipe

48:21.140 --> 48:24.820
is like same water?

48:25.940 --> 48:27.780
Or is there a yucky water pipe

48:27.780 --> 48:30.580
and then good healthy boy water pipe?

48:30.580 --> 48:33.220
I've always pictured it kind of like a whimsical

48:33.220 --> 48:36.740
kind of like pipe organ in a Disney cartoon

48:36.740 --> 48:39.140
or maybe one of those Disney movies like Mary Poppins

48:39.140 --> 48:42.900
or it's like mostly live action, but some animated stuff

48:42.900 --> 48:44.580
and like the pipe organ would be animated

48:44.580 --> 48:47.060
and it's like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

48:47.060 --> 48:50.180
And some of the pipes are nasty water.

48:50.180 --> 48:51.300
I love that, yeah.

48:51.300 --> 48:54.580
And there's somebody definitely playing it for each house.

48:54.580 --> 48:55.940
Yes, definitely.

48:55.940 --> 48:58.260
Somebody's got somebody underneath each house.

48:58.820 --> 49:00.900
There has to be some kind of oversight, right?

49:02.020 --> 49:03.780
Oh, you just flushed your toilet?

49:03.780 --> 49:05.940
Let's get some of the yucky water in there.

49:05.940 --> 49:08.420
Don't waste the good boy water on there.

49:08.420 --> 49:10.260
Because otherwise you're telling me that like,

49:10.820 --> 49:13.380
it's up to a machine and I don't trust that.

49:13.380 --> 49:15.380
I don't trust a machine to always know

49:15.380 --> 49:18.260
where the nasty water can come, where the good water can go.

49:18.260 --> 49:19.540
Right, exactly, yeah.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.780
No, yeah, because the computer's gonna switch it

49:21.780 --> 49:22.820
as like a cyber joke.

49:23.700 --> 49:26.180
Because the other option, the other thing that,

49:26.180 --> 49:29.140
I don't know, scientists might try to tell me

49:29.140 --> 49:31.140
is that the water in my toilet is the same

49:31.140 --> 49:32.820
as the water in my sink.

49:32.820 --> 49:36.660
And there's no way that's true, scientists.

49:36.660 --> 49:37.940
Can't possibly be true.

49:40.100 --> 49:41.540
Justin's trying to Google the,

49:41.540 --> 49:43.060
I know Justin's Googling the answer,

49:43.060 --> 49:44.820
like how does potty water work?

49:44.820 --> 49:46.180
Because he wants to be the smart,

49:46.180 --> 49:46.820
he always has to be the smart one.

49:46.820 --> 49:48.580
I don't know, it's just like, it's so,

49:48.580 --> 49:51.700
I just, you flush it and it goes to the sewer.

49:51.700 --> 49:52.900
But how's it come back, Justin?

49:52.900 --> 49:54.340
It's not about where it goes.

49:54.340 --> 49:55.140
How's it come up?

49:55.140 --> 49:57.460
Because it's filling from the same place

49:57.460 --> 49:58.820
as your potable water does.

49:58.820 --> 50:00.100
Whoa, whoa.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.500
You have one, you don't have a potable

50:02.500 --> 50:05.620
and non-potable water source going into your home.

50:05.620 --> 50:08.100
You're telling me, wait, stop, fuck you.

50:08.100 --> 50:11.140
Are you telling me that in my sink is doo-doo water?

50:11.140 --> 50:12.500
No, Travis.

50:12.500 --> 50:15.700
No, in your toilet is sink water.

50:15.700 --> 50:16.660
It's all in perspective, baby.

50:16.660 --> 50:18.820
But then my toilet, the water that comes up

50:18.820 --> 50:20.740
and grabs my poop and takes it away,

50:20.740 --> 50:22.580
is the same water that I use

50:22.580 --> 50:25.220
to wash my Lexapro down my throat?

50:26.340 --> 50:29.380
No, the same water you use to wash your Lexapro

50:29.380 --> 50:32.100
down your throat is so fancy

50:32.100 --> 50:34.660
that you're also treating your dookies.

50:34.660 --> 50:35.940
That seems like a waste.

50:35.940 --> 50:40.180
Hey, it's 2020, let's save some time

50:40.180 --> 50:42.820
and like money and energy where we can.

50:42.820 --> 50:45.140
I don't need fancy water to grab my dooks.

50:45.140 --> 50:46.980
All right, you wanna save money?

50:46.980 --> 50:49.460
Our infrastructure is a fucking disgrace

50:49.460 --> 50:52.500
and we're supposed to run new non-potable lines

50:52.500 --> 50:53.780
to everyone's homes?

50:53.780 --> 50:55.140
Are you okay, wait, let's start here.

50:55.140 --> 50:57.780
First, new lines to Flint, Michigan.

50:57.780 --> 51:00.340
Then, new lines to grab my dookie water.

51:00.340 --> 51:02.580
This is what's bugging me out, man.

51:02.580 --> 51:04.740
And sometimes we pretend like we don't know things

51:04.740 --> 51:06.340
on this show to like be funny.

51:06.340 --> 51:08.420
And like, that's why we say sometimes funny stuff

51:08.420 --> 51:12.180
like that the, you know, potty water would get

51:12.180 --> 51:15.540
in washing machine and like, that's funny.

51:15.540 --> 51:18.900
But I'm just double checking now.

51:18.900 --> 51:21.780
I'm not washing my clothes in poo-poo pee-pee water, right?

51:21.780 --> 51:23.300
That's, right?

51:23.300 --> 51:24.020
No, no.

51:25.220 --> 51:26.980
I just wanna make sure I haven't been doing it.

51:26.980 --> 51:28.580
I just wanna make sure I haven't been doing it wrong

51:28.580 --> 51:29.380
this whole time.

51:29.380 --> 51:32.580
Cause I didn't, you know, I've been adulting for a bit now

51:32.580 --> 51:34.340
but no one ever really teached me how.

51:34.340 --> 51:36.420
So just making sure it's not,

51:37.300 --> 51:39.620
I haven't been cleaning my clothes with poo-poo pee-pee water

51:39.620 --> 51:40.740
or brushing my teeth with it.

51:40.740 --> 51:43.780
You know, I used to watch those tiny house shows

51:43.780 --> 51:45.620
and the people would sometimes just kind of,

51:45.620 --> 51:47.220
let's be honest, shit in a box.

51:47.860 --> 51:50.420
And they would say like, it's a compostable toilet

51:50.420 --> 51:51.700
but you're shitting in a box.

51:52.340 --> 51:55.140
But now that I'm thinking about the risk

51:55.140 --> 51:57.860
of washing my clothes in poo-poo pee-pee water

51:57.860 --> 51:59.860
and I think maybe instead I poop in a box.

52:00.500 --> 52:01.700
Maybe I poop in a box.

52:01.700 --> 52:03.620
I just think the pipe should be above the ground

52:03.620 --> 52:04.900
cause when they're under the ground,

52:04.900 --> 52:07.540
that's where first of all, the machines can tell it

52:07.540 --> 52:09.460
where to go and which one gets put, yeah.

52:09.460 --> 52:12.180
Also that's fun cause then you can follow them

52:12.180 --> 52:13.700
like they do in Jurassic Park

52:13.700 --> 52:15.300
where there's like follow the red pipe

52:15.300 --> 52:17.140
and you know the red pipe is the hot water

52:17.140 --> 52:18.740
and the blue pipe is the cold water

52:18.740 --> 52:20.580
and the brown pipe is the poo-poo pee-pee water.

52:21.380 --> 52:21.860
Yeah.

52:21.860 --> 52:23.300
So embarrassing.

52:23.300 --> 52:24.740
What, Justin, what?

52:24.740 --> 52:26.180
This is so embarrassing.

52:26.180 --> 52:28.340
It's like you guys aren't even saying anything.

52:28.340 --> 52:29.700
This is embarrassing, I'm embarrassed.

52:29.700 --> 52:31.140
I just think that, here's the thing,

52:31.140 --> 52:33.140
electricity, I don't fucking care.

52:33.140 --> 52:35.860
How comes electricity and internet and phone wires

52:35.860 --> 52:39.300
get to be high up in the sky, paraded high up in the sky.

52:39.300 --> 52:40.500
Look at us, everybody.

52:40.500 --> 52:42.180
We've got electricity in us.

52:42.180 --> 52:43.460
You have to look at us.

52:43.460 --> 52:44.660
Birds are gonna sit on us

52:44.660 --> 52:47.060
and poo-poo all over your cars and crosswalks.

52:47.060 --> 52:48.820
No matter what, cause we're electricity,

52:48.820 --> 52:49.780
we get to be up high.

52:49.780 --> 52:51.620
And meanwhile, all the water is like,

52:51.620 --> 52:55.060
we have to live below the earth like sloppy mole men.

52:56.100 --> 52:59.220
I think we give it a chance to switch them around

52:59.220 --> 53:01.780
and we let the water ones be up above

53:01.780 --> 53:03.620
where we can keep an eye,

53:03.620 --> 53:05.860
it's that way we can see the water.

53:05.860 --> 53:08.580
The water goes through the wires.

53:08.580 --> 53:10.420
And the internet goes through the pipes.

53:11.300 --> 53:14.340
The pipes are gonna be way up high.

53:14.340 --> 53:16.740
So wait, big, heavy water pipes up in the sky?

53:17.540 --> 53:21.620
Not up in the sky, like 10 to 12 feet off the ground.

53:21.620 --> 53:23.140
You can put little birds on top of that,

53:23.140 --> 53:24.260
that would look dumb.

53:24.260 --> 53:26.820
I mean, we can get all kinds of animals up there,

53:27.380 --> 53:29.140
but the pipes will be clean

53:29.140 --> 53:31.540
and there'll be one clean water pipe

53:31.540 --> 53:33.460
and they'll be going in towards the city,

53:33.460 --> 53:35.300
but then there will be the dookie water pipe.

53:36.180 --> 53:37.620
Maybe we paint that one black.

53:37.620 --> 53:40.260
So we can see into it.

53:40.260 --> 53:41.460
I might be way off base here,

53:41.460 --> 53:42.820
but I'm gonna throw some spaghetti at the wall

53:42.820 --> 53:43.540
and see if it sticks.

53:44.180 --> 53:45.060
Clear pipes.

53:45.780 --> 53:46.420
Yeah, no.

53:46.420 --> 53:47.220
So you can see it all.

53:47.220 --> 53:47.860
That's what I'm saying.

53:47.860 --> 53:50.900
And just throwing this out here too, three pipes.

53:51.540 --> 53:54.260
One for clean, potable sink and laundry water.

53:54.900 --> 53:56.900
One for whatever water.

53:56.900 --> 53:59.220
We don't need to put a dirty label on it.

53:59.220 --> 54:00.580
And then the third one,

54:00.580 --> 54:03.060
just you see some salmon swimming in there.

54:03.060 --> 54:04.100
Oh, that's nice, that's relaxing.

54:04.100 --> 54:05.380
Yeah, for the animals to get through.

54:05.380 --> 54:07.380
How's a fish supposed to get through the city?

54:07.380 --> 54:08.020
Right?

54:08.020 --> 54:09.220
Fish wants to see shit.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.620
How come a bird gets to see everything?

54:12.420 --> 54:14.260
Fish never gets to see nothing.

54:14.260 --> 54:15.700
Yeah, fish see nothing.

54:15.700 --> 54:18.020
Hey, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

54:21.540 --> 54:25.380

between like live shows and travel

54:28.980 --> 54:31.380
and holidays and births of children.

54:32.820 --> 54:34.340

Also, we're gonna be performing some live shows

54:41.940 --> 54:43.780
here in Cincinnati at the end of February.

54:43.780 --> 54:45.140

54:45.140 --> 54:46.500
My Brother, My Brother and Me.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.180
And February 20th, we're going to be doing

54:48.180 --> 54:49.380

55:03.860 --> 55:05.940
one for sidekicks and one for hinges.

55:05.940 --> 55:07.620
I think they're all super cool.

55:08.260 --> 55:10.820
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

55:10.820 --> 55:12.420
for the use of our theme song.

55:14.100 --> 55:14.820
Holy shit.

55:15.620 --> 55:16.420
It's a departure.

55:17.380 --> 55:19.700
I got it confused with the other show that I do

55:20.340 --> 55:21.940
that I say the name of the theme song for

55:21.940 --> 55:23.700
and I actually forgot the name of this

55:23.700 --> 55:27.700
500 episode long podcast theme song.

55:27.700 --> 55:30.420
I apologize to everybody, but it's a good song.

55:30.420 --> 55:30.980
Great album.

55:30.980 --> 55:31.780

55:31.780 --> 55:33.300

55:48.180 --> 55:49.460
Every week on the show,

55:49.460 --> 55:51.620
we have Griffin read a Yahoo answer

55:51.620 --> 55:53.460
that we think about and come back next week and discuss.

55:54.260 --> 55:55.780
This one's sent in by Ivy.

55:55.780 --> 55:56.020
Thanks.

55:56.020 --> 55:58.180
It's synonymous Yahoo answer user also.

55:58.740 --> 56:01.860
Mr. Peanut Rips up asks,

56:01.860 --> 56:03.540
how come if we flew to the moon,

56:04.180 --> 56:07.220
nobody ever tried to fly underneath the earth

56:07.220 --> 56:08.980
to see what's really down there?

56:09.620 --> 56:11.620
Whoa!

56:11.620 --> 56:12.820
My name's Justin McElroy.

56:12.820 --> 56:13.780
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:13.780 --> 56:14.980
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:14.980 --> 56:16.500
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

56:16.500 --> 56:17.540
Kiss your dad.

56:17.540 --> 56:33.700
Just grab my lips.
