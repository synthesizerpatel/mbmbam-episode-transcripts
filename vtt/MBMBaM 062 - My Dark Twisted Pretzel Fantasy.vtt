00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.040
Good morning, America. Happy birthday. You did it, America. Good work.

00:50.400 --> 00:57.920
It's your 240th anniversary of being a thing. Your inevitable decline

00:57.920 --> 01:05.920
is, well, I think it's still pretty much on the way. You're still on it, but the ride hasn't come

01:05.920 --> 01:12.000
to a stop yet. We've had a good run, though. We had a good run, America. So eat a hot dog and

01:12.000 --> 01:23.120
watch our country slowly pass away. I watched this movie about the collapse of America yesterday,

01:23.120 --> 01:30.320
and it was called Zookeeper. It's all about how we're just done. We're all just done here.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.160
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

01:34.160 --> 01:39.440
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your precious moments baby

01:39.440 --> 01:46.640
doll, Griffin McElroy. Sweet little porcelain baby. All right, my sweet little porcelain angels,

01:46.640 --> 01:51.200
today we're going to take questions from our readers, and we're going to give them advice

01:51.200 --> 01:57.360
about them. What do you think about that? I hate it. Yeah, let's change it up. It's just

01:57.360 --> 02:04.960
like Dear Abby. Is she still alive? I hope she's still alive. I would like to rename her column

02:04.960 --> 02:13.920
and just call it, Hey Abby. Sup bitch. This is my column, Sup Bitch. People email me and they're

02:13.920 --> 02:23.040
like, Sup with this bitch. I'm like, I don't know whore. Bitch, my shit is fucked. Hey Abby, you

02:23.040 --> 02:35.040
bitch. My shit is so fucked. My shit is fucked to four miles. Fix me. Open up that stupid burp

02:35.040 --> 02:45.600
machine you call mouth you whore. Just give me some fucking advice. Like a weird anti-Dear Abby

02:45.600 --> 02:54.160
turn. Possibly an anti-women turn all together. Was it an anti-women turn? I don't know. Let's

02:54.160 --> 03:01.040
ask half our audience. Oops, they're gone. They already left. Click. It's off. Let's get right

03:01.040 --> 03:12.720
into the questions. Hey, I had sex for the first time. How was it? Tell me everything. Tell your

03:12.720 --> 03:19.200
buddy Mike Love. Tell him everything. Hey, how would my girlfriend feel if I told her this?

03:19.840 --> 03:23.200
She knew going into this relationship I was inexperienced, but I don't think she knew the

03:23.200 --> 03:29.840
extent. I'll take my answer off the air. Sexed insult like, hey bro. I bet she knows. She knows,

03:29.840 --> 03:37.760
buddy. She knows. What? But you are a fantastic lover. You are a wonderful lover. It is glaringly

03:37.760 --> 03:43.280
obvious that was your first time making love to a female. The fact that you stood back going,

03:43.280 --> 03:48.720
hmm, where to start? Yeah. Let's see. There's a good chance that you yelled, I'm doing it. I'm

03:48.720 --> 03:55.280
doing it. If that is the case, then the cat is out of the bag. Well, the claims do come true.

03:55.280 --> 04:02.880
The crying, I think, was a big tip off. Yes. Did you go, ew? Because that was my jam the first

04:02.880 --> 04:10.640
time. Oh, yeah? Who knows what's going on in there? Yeah. Ew, yucky. It's upsetting. Sorry,

04:10.640 --> 04:17.840
Jesus. I'm sorry, Jesus. Don't look. This is happening. Don't look. Don't look, Jesus. I can't

04:17.840 --> 04:26.320
help myself. That's why people use sheets. I think, I mean, if you were going to tell her,

04:26.880 --> 04:34.080
you needed to tell her before. I personally, I don't think you can spring that on. Plus,

04:34.080 --> 04:38.960
why didn't, girls love to take guys for genity. You should have told her. She would have really

04:38.960 --> 04:44.080
enjoyed that. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Really? They love it. They can't get enough. Yeah. They

04:44.080 --> 04:50.800
collect them on like necklaces. That's untrue. How many virginities do you have? Oh, they collect

04:50.800 --> 04:58.000
them like silly bands. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, that's what they make scrunchies out of. Yeah,

04:58.000 --> 05:05.200
that's what scrunchie is. It's made of a man's virginity. I think that you can't tell her anymore.

05:05.200 --> 05:10.560
I think that you have to keep this lie forever. I think you can tell her if you start off with,

05:10.560 --> 05:16.240
oh, by the way, funny story. Hey, you know, I was thinking about it and I don't think I've

05:16.240 --> 05:25.280
had sex before this. I checked my diary and it turns out. I thought I did. I thought I had sex

05:25.280 --> 05:30.480
at Lollapalooza last year, but I didn't. I just saw the Neville Brothers in concert. Wait, here's

05:30.480 --> 05:39.280
a really important question. How old are you? Wait, because there's a window where this question

05:39.280 --> 05:48.720
isn't creepy, right? Yeah. That window is like 15 to 18. What? Yeah, like 15 to 18. Bad news,

05:48.720 --> 05:54.800
everybody. According to Travis, if you haven't burned down by 18, you're a mutant. You're some

05:54.800 --> 05:59.520
kind of monster. That's good, Travis. That's a really positive message to send to America's youth.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.880
No, no, no. All I'm saying is that if by 18, I think that at that point you can get away with

06:04.880 --> 06:10.960
saying it after, I think after 18 in college, you need to say it up front and before. Why is it any

06:10.960 --> 06:17.040
of her business? I don't understand a thing you're saying. Yeah, your logic is not. I think this is

06:17.040 --> 06:20.960
one of the situations where you're just saying things and even you don't believe them. Is that

06:20.960 --> 06:28.720
where we've wandered into? Yeah, more or less. All of the best advice is birthed from that place of

06:28.720 --> 06:34.960
disingenuousness. Travis, sometimes they'll just decide, I know the words I'd like to say right

06:34.960 --> 06:40.080
now. Well, once you get halfway through that sentence, you can't do a U-turn. You got to follow

06:40.080 --> 06:45.200
that road. Yeah, sure. I think maybe sometimes you're hoping there's a joke there, but instead

06:45.200 --> 06:51.520
you just say something that's wrong and you just let it lie out there. Yep. They can't all be

06:51.520 --> 07:01.040
winners. Listen, listen, people. It's a free show, okay? Free podcast. I think that you can say it,

07:01.040 --> 07:06.400
I think you can safely say it afterwards, but it has to be immediately, like I think you probably,

07:06.400 --> 07:12.400
it has to be immediately post coitus. Like, so that was sex, huh? That was it? That's it? You've

07:12.400 --> 07:19.760
been waiting all this time for that? I think you could tell her and I think it'll be okay. But if

07:19.760 --> 07:25.120
not, then you know, maybe you weren't meant to be with her. Why don't you look her dead in the eye

07:25.120 --> 07:31.840
and say, Hey, Tracy, I just want you to know you're the best I ever had. And then wink at her

07:31.840 --> 07:37.280
and she can read into that however you want. If, if she, if she gets it from that, God bless her.

07:37.280 --> 07:43.600
If she doesn't, you try to tell her in your, in your way, in your own way. Hey, in your shady,

07:43.600 --> 07:50.240
sneaky way. In your shady, sneaky, virginic way. Your way is terrible. She probably would have

07:50.240 --> 07:54.720
been more forgiving if you told her beforehand, but now the damage is done. Maybe she'll be

07:54.720 --> 07:58.960
relieved. Maybe she'll be like, Oh God, okay. Cause it was terrible. If you think you're about

07:58.960 --> 08:01.520
to have sex with her again, I want you to look her in the eye and say, I want you to know I've

08:01.520 --> 08:07.280
never had sex. And then she'll be like, well, wait a minute. And you'll say that, wait, that was sex?

08:07.280 --> 08:14.320
That was it? I need to go. I'm hungry. I've been talking to this guy for a while and it seemed

08:14.320 --> 08:18.320
like we were hitting it off. I got sick of waiting for him to make a move. So I just asked about

08:18.320 --> 08:22.960
myself. I've never asked a guy out before and as such have never been responsible for first date

08:22.960 --> 08:31.600
plans. So far the play consists of doing something also. Also, I feel like since I did the asking,

08:31.600 --> 08:36.240
I should be paying for the date, but that because that's what classy broads do. I'm kind of broke.

08:36.240 --> 08:42.240
What's a cheap first date idea that won't make me seem completely lame? How do you like it?

08:42.880 --> 08:49.040
Take his virginity. Do you live in Salt Lake? It's free and he'll have a great time.

08:51.120 --> 08:57.760
Uh, what about museums? People like those, right? You got to pay though. Got to pay some, some of

08:57.760 --> 09:02.480
the effort for most of them. No, it depends. If you want to go to a good museum with all the best

09:02.480 --> 09:06.880
art, you got to drop a, you got to drop some scrilla. Oh, art, art, no art. I was saying

09:06.880 --> 09:12.400
science museum. Go to CoSci. Ooh, we got friends there. We're connected at CoSci. Take her,

09:12.400 --> 09:17.520
take him to science museum. Check out that Cracker Jacks display. Oh my God. There's so

09:17.520 --> 09:22.240
many different Cracker Jacks there. Make a music video, ride a bike backwards over a tightrope.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.800
There's rap basketball and everything. You want to learn about chemistry? They got you.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.280
I do believe CoSci costs money though. I'll have to check, but I'm pretty sure they need money to,

09:31.280 --> 09:37.840
to, I mean, to pay the rats. First of all. Yeah. Yeah. So we don't get the lockout. Yeah.

09:37.840 --> 09:43.200
Especially LeBron. The one rat named LeBron. He got a really smart head after that. Picnic.

09:43.200 --> 09:48.400
Picnic. I think a picnic's a great idea. No, I think the problem is, I think first date,

09:49.280 --> 09:53.840
that's, it's a little too intense to go for a picnic. I think this time of year, you don't want

09:53.840 --> 09:58.640
to do it. People say, how was your first date? And you say, well, it was muggy. Yeah. Very sweaty.

09:58.640 --> 10:04.240
You can't control like the, what if it rains and then it's like, well, I guess our date is canceled.

10:04.240 --> 10:09.280
You know, I guess our love is canceled. Yeah. That was our shot, I guess. What happens if,

10:09.280 --> 10:16.320
what happens if, and by if, I mean, when a bear attacks you and takes your, and takes your stuff,

10:16.320 --> 10:22.160
takes your picnic basket and your wallet. Yeah. Bears are mean motherfuckers.

10:22.160 --> 10:27.840
Bears are mean motherfuckers. They will rip you off. Maybe you should just ask him why he,

10:29.280 --> 10:35.120
I don't think this guy's worth your time. Why didn't he ask you out? Yeah, forget this guy.

10:35.760 --> 10:41.440
He's just in it for a free meal. Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Maybe he's shy. Maybe he's shy?

10:41.440 --> 10:46.080
Well, but that gets tricky because to be shy, the best first dates are the ones where you get

10:46.080 --> 10:49.600
to know each other and you go and talk and like, and actually hang out. Absolutely. I don't,

10:49.600 --> 10:53.360
I don't think movies are good first dates because you just sit there in the dark not talking.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.120
Um, but if he's shy, it's going to make the whole thing trickier.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.760
Cause you're going to have to do something that kind of draws him out of his shell. No, no, no,

11:01.760 --> 11:06.960
no, no. Cause you can, you can be functionally shy, right? You can be functionally shy,

11:06.960 --> 11:13.040
but that doesn't mean that you're socially shy, right? Like I'm functionally shy. I'm terrible.

11:13.040 --> 11:18.880
I'm terrible at getting people together to do shit. Um, but once I'm at the shit, like I,

11:18.880 --> 11:25.040
I can be sociable. I think there's two different kinds of charisma there. He may have the important

11:25.040 --> 11:29.600
one. I'll tell you what I think is good. I think going to the mall is good because if you go to the

11:29.600 --> 11:33.920
mall with like, well, you go with like a purpose, right? Like I need to get a belt, so let's go to

11:33.920 --> 11:39.600
the mall together. The mall is very good because a lots of stuff to talk about. Um, B you could

11:39.600 --> 11:43.840
transition pretty well. Like if things are going well and you want the day to keep going, you can

11:43.840 --> 11:50.320
sort of transition it into dinner at the mall. Yeah. Right. And, or if it's like, and there's

11:50.320 --> 11:54.640
always a movie theater around the mall, so you can go after you talk and hang out and everything.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.720
Yeah. If you want to continue things, there's a lot of options there. I, you get to go to the

11:58.720 --> 12:04.320
mall, which is always fun. I think gotta know, you've got to know her position on pretzels.

12:04.320 --> 12:11.360
What's she working with? Is she, uh, is she an auntie Anne's lady? Is she, uh, is she, uh,

12:11.360 --> 12:15.920
twisty McGee's? Is she down with twisty McGee's? Cause if not, she got a kicker right to the curb.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.040
Did she like my dark twisted pretzel fantasy? I have to know.

12:23.200 --> 12:29.520
You might think you've peeped these pretzels, but these real pretzels are far, far too tasty.

12:29.520 --> 12:34.720
No one man should have all these pretzel dogs. I'm full. I'm truly full.

12:34.720 --> 12:47.280
Can we, can we get much fresher? So fresh. So salty. So yeah, that's, uh, that I think the mall,

12:47.280 --> 12:52.240
that's my official recommendation. Don't cost nothing. If, if your first dinner date takes

12:52.240 --> 12:56.560
place at the Chick-fil-A at the mall, I'm going to find you and I'm going to hurt you somehow.

12:56.560 --> 13:02.080
Well, the bonus of the mall is if you walk in and he's like, but first I got to hit up hot topic.

13:02.080 --> 13:08.240
Then, you know, instantly to get out of that date and go home. Why? They got good shirts.

13:08.240 --> 13:15.120
They have good shirts and all finger rings there. But that's his first priority. Gotta go to hot

13:15.120 --> 13:20.640
topic. Well, you want to get the first batch of all finger rings and, um, steampunk goggles.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.320
You gotta get the first batch because they're the best batch. They might say something. What

13:24.320 --> 13:28.640
if he says something like, I'm just going to dip in the Hollister real quick. Like you go ahead

13:28.640 --> 13:36.800
in there. I'm going to go to the car and I'll be waiting for you. Hollister has good beach sweaters.

13:36.800 --> 13:40.880
So I don't know what you're complaining about. What if he just wants to duck into Claire's?

13:42.240 --> 13:50.000
Claire's has good accessories. I don't know what Claire's does. Lady accessories, like, like

13:50.000 --> 13:59.360
diaphragms. That's gross. That is gross. Griffin, why don't you give us a palette cleansing?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.920
Let's get the taste of that last question out of our mouth. Uh, this one was sent in by Johnny

14:03.920 --> 14:07.760
Wags. Thanks, Johnny Wags. It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mary Martin, who asks

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
my 17 year old son wets his pants when he laughs too hard. Should he wear a diaper to carrot tops

14:16.000 --> 14:24.400
show? It really turned around right there at the end. Carrot top is my son's favorite comedian.

14:24.400 --> 14:29.120
He's 17 and loves to laugh and dreams of being a comedian. The problem is that once he starts

14:29.120 --> 14:33.520
laughing, he can't stop and he often loses bladder control. He wants to wear a disposable diaper to

14:33.520 --> 14:37.200
the carrot top show. I think it's okay, but my husband thinks that if he can't control his

14:37.200 --> 14:43.840
bladder that he shouldn't go to the show at all. Who's right? This is a disease that affects,

14:43.840 --> 14:50.160
this is a disease that affects a surprising amount. Carrot top. Finding carrot top funny.

14:50.160 --> 14:58.640
Yes. It's so many people. It's terminal in most cases too. Um, cause you just chuckle yourself

14:58.640 --> 15:04.240
to death at his, at his goofs and his props. I think you should have, if you will have so hard

15:04.240 --> 15:08.880
a carrot top that you pee, I think you should have to have pee pants forever and wear that.

15:08.880 --> 15:15.760
With a shirt that announces why I wear pee pants because I think carrot top is funny.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.520
This is my futuristic chastity belt. Like no one touched me, please.

15:19.520 --> 15:25.040
I mean, incontinence sucks. Like it sucks to be that young and have this problem.

15:25.040 --> 15:31.920
But if you, if you can say the words in your life and have it be true, I laughed so hard at carrot

15:31.920 --> 15:39.200
top that I, I evacuated my pee pee into my adult diapers. Then you're done. Like you're done. You

15:39.200 --> 15:43.520
don't have anything else left that you can do. You're done. That'd be a fun checkout at the

15:43.520 --> 15:49.040
grocery store. No, yeah. I'm going to see, uh, go to see carrot top. Gotta pad up before the

15:49.040 --> 15:56.160
C top show. Cause I'm afraid that I will urinate in my pants. What if, what if carrot top does some

15:56.160 --> 16:06.240
hilarious adult diapers goofs? Anybody raise that show hands. And then what if you meet him after

16:06.240 --> 16:12.560
the show and you're like, Hey Scott, listen, your, your joke up there about the diapers. It really

16:12.560 --> 16:16.960
hit home at a very personal place for me because I love your work. I don't know if you noticed,

16:16.960 --> 16:21.440
I laughed so hard, Scott, that I peed in my, I made pee in my pants because of the jokes that

16:21.440 --> 16:25.600
you were laying down up there. And when you poured those frozen peas in your pants and you said,

16:25.600 --> 16:31.600
I just peed my pants, it made me cry a little bit. And then I peed a little bit. Is Scott carrot top

16:31.600 --> 16:38.480
name? Yeah. Do you think people, I was thinking about this just now. Do you think when you're

16:38.480 --> 16:44.480
backstage, you're the stage manager of the carrot top show? Do you say like five minutes, carrot top

16:46.720 --> 16:50.640
Mr. Top, Mr. Top, just five minutes, just five minutes, sir.

16:50.640 --> 16:56.400
So you fucking unleash your comedy rodeo yet again. That's a good question. What do you call

16:56.400 --> 17:02.880
Gallagher? You call him Gallagher. Oh, is that his name? Oh, wait. You call him Mr. Gallagher? You

17:02.880 --> 17:10.480
call him a racist, right? You call him a bigot. A bigot. Tell me your racist show. What do you call,

17:11.040 --> 17:15.840
what do you call? I don't know. Carrot top's really in a league of his own.

17:15.840 --> 17:21.360
His bit role in league of their own is really good. That's one of the rare moments where he

17:21.360 --> 17:30.640
plays a plucky outfielder, Denise Williams. And she looks kind of like the Wendy's girl.

17:30.640 --> 17:40.160
And she's actually played by Carrot Top. It's one of those. You know who I love in this scenario

17:40.160 --> 17:46.880
is the dad who's like, the dad who's like, my son has a problem and it's serious and it's going to

17:46.880 --> 17:51.920
affect him for his entire life. But you know what, son, if you can't get your shit right,

17:51.920 --> 17:56.480
you don't get to go to the carrot top show. I think that this dad is the only one with a fucking

17:56.480 --> 18:02.880
level head on his shoulders. He's the only one on team. Let's not go see Scott jokes on a stage

18:02.880 --> 18:10.880
about his props. He's looking for any excuse not to go. Maybe this kid hates carrots up. This is

18:10.880 --> 18:14.720
the only way he could think of to get out of going to the show. Like, yeah, if I will go,

18:14.720 --> 18:20.000
but I'm going to wear an adult diaper. I feel like 17 year old son is going to fucking hate his dad.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.960
Fuck you, dad. I just want to go see carrots out. Fuck you. But when that kid's like 30,

18:24.960 --> 18:29.680
he's gonna be like, yeah, one time my dad showed me some tough stuff. And I was like,

18:29.680 --> 18:33.840
he's gonna be like, yeah, one time my dad showed me some tough love, but he kept me from going to

18:33.840 --> 18:38.400
see carrot top. He saved my life that night. I think we're going to get back together and,

18:38.400 --> 18:44.160
and work out our differences. By the way, uh, I really enjoyed zoo keeper three. You don't have

18:44.160 --> 18:51.680
any adult diapers on handy. I pretty much ruined mine. It's like a, it's like a, a wad of toilet

18:51.680 --> 18:58.960
paper. You dropped in a sink in here. It's really swimming. This kid watched chairman of the board

18:58.960 --> 19:06.720
and he peed the entire theater. Excuse me. I wet your theater. I wet everything. Everything is

19:06.720 --> 19:14.240
moist. Damn you. Carrot top and your, your props. Your goofy props. You Prince of props. This poor,

19:14.240 --> 19:20.800
that poor dad. Can you imagine? We should look out for a younger answer where someone asks if

19:20.800 --> 19:25.920
they can simultaneously divorce their wife and their son to save on the lawyer's fees. Hey Steve,

19:25.920 --> 19:31.520
how's your kid? Oh yeah. He's good. He's still doing that thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

19:31.520 --> 19:38.160
But only to carrot top. Now he's like a, he's like a canary that they send into theaters to

19:38.160 --> 19:51.520
tell if there's carrot top movies in them. It's too dangerous. Carrot top movies naturally produce

19:51.520 --> 19:58.160
methane gas, which kills everybody in the audience. You produce methane gas. Carrot tops hit character

19:58.160 --> 20:07.440
Dr. Fart. Did you see that movie that he did Dr. Fart? Yeah. Yeah. He's got, uh, he's got one of

20:07.440 --> 20:12.160
those party whistles like on the back of his pants so that every time he does, um, that he does break

20:12.160 --> 20:17.920
wind, it blows out and it makes a honk, makes a honk sound. Oh fuck. I peed my pants. Just talking

20:17.920 --> 20:27.280
about it. Oh no. Uh, you know, uh, the, the sort of Himmler inspired character, uh, hair freshener,

20:27.280 --> 20:32.560
uh, that, that was played by Jeff Conway was actually his last, uh, screen role. A lot of

20:32.560 --> 20:39.360
people don't know that. That's, that's because it's a very sad thing to say. You see hair freshener.

20:39.360 --> 20:46.720
See, I regularly get into an argument with a friend of mine about a habit, uh, of mentioning

20:46.720 --> 20:52.080
the reviews of a movie before I see them. Example being, I read a review or I don't think that got

20:52.080 --> 20:58.240
very good reviews. He argues that some should see movies about themselves before they pass judgment.

20:58.240 --> 21:05.360
Who is right? Bim bam. I do the same thing. That's all point reviews, right? I'm such a busy fucking

21:05.360 --> 21:09.920
guy. I can't afford to go see a movie that I think is going to be a jam and then it ends up to be a

21:09.920 --> 21:14.960
clunker. I, what I do is there are some movies where I'm like, listen, no matter what kind of

21:14.960 --> 21:18.960
reviews this gets, I'm going to go see it because I love the franchise or I love the actor or I love

21:18.960 --> 21:24.000
whatever. But the majority of movies I'm going to check first and be like, oh, this is getting like

21:24.000 --> 21:29.760
a 10%. I ain't going to see that movie. Yeah. I think you just wait for it to come in on DVD or

21:29.760 --> 21:35.520
Netflix. Even then, I'll watch anything on Netflix. I'll watch some bullshit on Netflix, but going to

21:35.520 --> 21:43.360
the theater, you can't go to a theater and spend less than $35. I find it a babysitter for the kids.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.920
You got to get an adult diaper because you're seeing a carrot top movie. You got to get popcorn,

21:47.920 --> 21:55.840
soda, an extra large soda because fuck it. You know, it doesn't matter. Have you guys noticed

21:55.840 --> 22:04.080
how big these movie theater sodas are? I think that as someone who writes reviews professionally,

22:04.080 --> 22:09.680
I think reviews are grand. I think you should always read reviews. To be fair though, I think

22:09.680 --> 22:15.040
the difference there is, I mean, yes, movies have gotten expensive and everything, but it's still

22:15.040 --> 22:20.640
not 50 bucks. Like you're still not doing that big of an investment. There are some movies that I

22:20.640 --> 22:27.200
think you just risk it and go see anything less than 50 goddamn American dollars is that's not

22:27.200 --> 22:32.640
even money. I'm saying that if it is a movie that I watched the previews for and I want to go see,

22:33.520 --> 22:38.240
like there is no amount of bad reviews. That's going to change my mind on that.

22:38.240 --> 22:44.560
There are some, I can't fight that feeling where I see a bad movie and I know that there

22:44.560 --> 22:47.840
were better movies in the theater. Like for reasons that I won't go into here,

22:47.840 --> 22:51.920
I saw bad teacher a couple of weeks ago. Do you know how that felt?

22:51.920 --> 22:52.560
Are you sad?

22:53.120 --> 22:56.480
It was sad because I knew that there were like better movies playing. Like,

22:56.480 --> 22:59.280
you know how sad that made me? Like wicked sad.

22:59.840 --> 23:03.440
Yeah, but I also, I always think about the fact that like I want to go see

23:03.440 --> 23:09.040
Horrible Bosses, but everything is telling me not to. And so maybe I'll find it really,

23:09.040 --> 23:16.160
really funny, but you do like some really bad things though. I do love bad shit. That's the

23:16.160 --> 23:20.880
thing is like, I've learned from Netflix that I love terrible, terrible movies.

23:20.880 --> 23:24.720
And Travis doesn't like the fun way that normal people like them. Like Travis

23:25.280 --> 23:30.800
bumped that, that, uh, what's that movie where the guy does Kung Fu?

23:31.680 --> 23:33.200
Oh, are you talking about Kung Pao?

23:33.200 --> 23:37.920
Yeah, Kung Pao. Man, you guys, you guys bumped that one. You wore that dude without.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.160
I still own two copies of that.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.760
Yeah, you can't get enough, right?

23:41.760 --> 23:43.040
No, I love that movie.

23:43.040 --> 23:48.800
I love, I, um, I share Travis's Netflix account. I have it hooked up to my, my PS3 so I can use

23:48.800 --> 23:53.440
his account to watch movies. And the recommendations that pop up are probably my favorite thing,

23:53.440 --> 23:58.880
like on a planet like here's, here's more movies like Earth Girls are easy. Thanks, dude.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.360
Thanks, Netflix.

24:01.360 --> 24:05.440
To be fair, the funny thing is I love really terrible 80s movies and Griffin loves horror

24:05.440 --> 24:10.640
movies. So the recommendations that they come up with is some of the most twisted shit I've ever

24:10.640 --> 24:10.800
seen.

24:10.800 --> 24:14.400
It usually just gives up. It's like, fuck it. You get Kangaroo Jack. Watch it.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.560
I hate you guys. You broke my computer brain.

24:19.440 --> 24:23.600
I love, I love those recommendations though. Cause it's like here's some movies like Earth

24:23.600 --> 24:31.200
Girls are easy. Cocoon. Well, I'm not actually sure that that's 2001 is Space Odyssey. Netflix

24:31.200 --> 24:35.840
just because it has space in it. That's not, there's two different things.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.680
And also to be fair real quick, while we're talking to Netflix, I've noticed Netflix that

24:39.680 --> 24:44.400
sometimes it'll say shit like, uh, recommendations. If you liked Earth Girls are easy, check out

24:44.400 --> 24:47.760
Earth Girls are easy. That's some weak ass shit. Netflix.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.280
Netflix. Are you sure that I'll like that? Dumb, lazy bitch.

24:53.920 --> 24:58.000
Oh, that reminds me. Have you seen Earth Girls are easy? I have Netflix. You know, I have

24:58.000 --> 25:07.040
Netflix. I watched it on you. I used you to watch it. You know that, you know, this true.

25:08.400 --> 25:14.240
Can we go see Earth Girls are easy? We can't because we just did seconds ago.

25:14.240 --> 25:19.280
I got a theatrical cut. That's the same one. I watched that one with you. You loved it.

25:19.280 --> 25:23.680
This one has even more Jeff Goldblum sex scenes and he's furry in them.

25:23.680 --> 25:28.640
I don't know how much you like that. Oh, you like furry Jeff Goldblum sex movies?

25:28.640 --> 25:29.760
Here's Earth Girls are easy.

25:33.200 --> 25:38.320
Perfect. Hey, have you seen Das Boot? Let me start it up. What the fuck? This is Earth

25:38.320 --> 25:43.680
Girls are easy again. You just changed the picture. You changed the bunk line.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.840
Actually, now that I've examined it here, I can see where you've just hastily scribbled

25:47.840 --> 25:54.160
Das Boot in crayon over the Earth Girls are easy box and just darkened everything so it

25:54.160 --> 25:57.920
looks like it's in a submarine. I was trying to watch the pianist,

25:57.920 --> 26:01.520
but I see that you went ahead and you just loaded up Earth Girls are easy.

26:01.520 --> 26:06.880
By the way, if someone makes an Earth Girls are easy sequel in a submarine,

26:06.880 --> 26:10.320
I would be Earth Girls are easy and oh my God, there's so much water.

26:12.720 --> 26:17.600
Earth Girls are easy and deeply submerged. Like I would watch that. I would watch that movie.

26:17.600 --> 26:24.560
I think who would be okay. Who would be the aliens like before it was Damon Wayans,

26:24.560 --> 26:29.840
Jeff Goldblum and Jim Carrey who would be like, oh, Christ, that's such a power pack.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.760
That's like the I mean, you gotta see like the new that's like the new Hollywood Rat Pack,

26:33.760 --> 26:37.600
right? God, I don't know. Dax Shepard weasels his way in there, right?

26:39.120 --> 26:44.800
Who's that funny fat kid from Superbad? Gotta get two scoops of Dax. Gotta get Dax up in there.

26:44.800 --> 26:48.800
I see. I think Jonah Hill's too big now. Jonah. Oh, he wouldn't fit in the submarine.

26:52.800 --> 26:59.760
Asshole. I think Dax Shepard. I think that I think the DL Hughley could use a job.

27:04.880 --> 27:13.600
I need one more. Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey. Jim this summer. Jim Carrey, Dax Shepard

27:13.600 --> 27:19.600
and DL Hughley learn that Earth girls are easy and also underwater pretty deeply.

27:20.640 --> 27:28.240
They learn how to steer submarines and also how to please a woman. Bring a backup diaper

27:28.240 --> 27:33.040
because who's that driving the submarine? It's Carrot Top. God, this is a good movie.

27:34.160 --> 27:38.960
When is this coming out? I really do want to see it. I'll wait and read the reviews.

27:38.960 --> 27:45.360
Somehow the moment I think somehow the moment the ideas of Earth girls are easy sequel and Dax

27:45.360 --> 27:49.440
Shepard entered my head, I knew that it was too terrifying a reality that it would not come to

27:49.440 --> 27:57.120
pass. It's just too horrifying to joke about. Griffin. Yeah, I got you. Gimme. This one was

27:57.120 --> 28:05.600
sent in by Adam Cole. Thank you, Adam Cole. It's by Yahoo Answers user RandomDude1003 who asks,

28:05.600 --> 28:11.440
is my little brother normal? I'm trying to be the person to explain to him any questions about

28:11.440 --> 28:15.040
puberty, but he doesn't want to know how to masturbate. Is that weird?

28:19.040 --> 28:23.600
Just come over here, little bubby. Sit down. Why don't you want to know this? This is like the

28:23.600 --> 28:30.960
best. This is like the most important thing. It's like puberty 101. You got to know this one thing

28:30.960 --> 28:36.800
or none of the other things will work out very well. It's the keystone. If you met my little

28:36.800 --> 28:42.800
brother, if you get him within 30 feet of a female between the ages of 13 and 60, he will attack them

28:42.800 --> 28:48.800
like a rabid dog. He will leap across the dinner table and gobble them up because he will not learn

28:48.800 --> 28:58.240
how to masturbate. To be fair, his little brother is five. Gross. What are you even saying? Are you

28:58.240 --> 29:04.960
saying little brother is going through five-year-old puberty? What are you saying? Hey, Mike. Wait,

29:04.960 --> 29:14.480
wait, wait. Pass me my juice. I'm going to watch some Yu-Gi-Oh! You down? You got to check this

29:14.480 --> 29:20.480
Saturday morning lineup. We got Yu-Gi-Oh! We got Phineas and Ferb and SpongeBob. It's fucking sick.

29:20.480 --> 29:32.880
It's fucking killer. I spilled Capri's son on my jam jams. Fuck. My whole scene is fucked, Mike.

29:35.520 --> 29:39.360
Hey, mom, throw my jam jams in the dryer. Got Capri on them again.

29:39.920 --> 29:44.480
Fuck. This wouldn't be so frustrating if I knew how to jerk it. Fuck this. Fuck everything.

29:44.480 --> 29:52.720
I wish I was three again. Shit was so easy back then.

29:54.080 --> 29:59.680
I think Justin left, so in his absence, I'm going to suggest we make a trip to the money zone.

30:07.760 --> 30:13.360
Today, we're in the car with the Super Brophy Brothers. It's a webcomic. They've got brothers

30:13.360 --> 30:17.760
in it. Brothers are involved, Griffin. Is that correct? That's all you really need to know. I

30:17.760 --> 30:22.560
mean, if you're listening to the show, you're obviously a connoisseur of sibling-based entertainment,

30:22.560 --> 30:26.960
and this is what you're going to get with the Super Brophy Brothers. They're a webcomic.

30:26.960 --> 30:34.160
They're also a podcast, so they're trying to step to our game, and all I have to say is if you step

30:34.160 --> 30:39.600
to this face, then you're going to get cut up. Well, there you go, and you can find it at

30:39.600 --> 30:45.200
superbrophybrothers.com. That's brophy, B-R-O-P-H-Y, brothers.com.

30:46.240 --> 30:50.240
Get down on the fucking ground floor of that joint. By the time you get there, though,

30:50.240 --> 30:53.360
they'll probably be all cut because they stepped to our game and tried to cop our swagger.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.400
Sorry about all the blood on your comic that you make. Also up there, we got Mark Montalbano,

31:00.400 --> 31:09.840
but Addy calls him Man Bear Pig. Aw, that's a strange little pet name. That is weird. They

31:09.840 --> 31:15.920
hooked up in 07 while they were working at a cool non-profit together, and then they got married

31:15.920 --> 31:24.000
on a mountaintop. When you say hooked up, you mean met and became acquainted, right? Not like

31:24.000 --> 31:32.960
they fucked, because that's way too personal. They became lovers. July 10th, 2010. So they've

31:32.960 --> 31:38.080
been married a year yesterday. And she wants him to know that he is her best friend, and she'll

31:38.080 --> 31:45.440
love him till death or zombies. That's precious. So we love you two, and now Griffin is going to

31:45.440 --> 31:59.040
play a little jingle he wrote for everyone. Can't get enough of that brotherly love.

32:00.480 --> 32:06.560
We are offended, but you should still listen to that other podcast.

32:06.560 --> 32:13.360
The Super Brophy Brothers Podcast.

32:17.360 --> 32:21.360
Perfect. Great. Good. Now the other one. Now the other one.

32:21.360 --> 32:35.760
Man Bear Pig. It's three things.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.280
I think that's great.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.680
That's just Man Bear Pig. He's three things.

32:45.680 --> 32:52.240
I think that's great. So thank you guys so much for taking us on that journey.

32:52.240 --> 32:59.040
If you would like to get on the Jumbotron, on our fancy new multi-million dollar Jumbotron,

32:59.040 --> 33:05.840
where do they go, Griffin? What's the address? It is maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron.

33:06.560 --> 33:14.640
And you can just go there, and it's easier than our previous signup process. Get in there,

33:14.640 --> 33:21.360
get your mention, get your special occasion noted on a Max Fun Show. Well, let's be honest,

33:21.360 --> 33:28.560
our show. Fuck those guys. We need your zinni. We're on that paper chase. We're on the paper

33:28.560 --> 33:34.240
chase, and we need to get paid. Is it okay to take my shoes off at the office?

33:35.520 --> 33:41.280
I think you're very warm, and even with powders and potions, I suffer. They are not odorous,

33:41.280 --> 33:47.280
just uncomfortable. I think this is reasonable to do under a desk. If Fred maintains, I am a

33:47.280 --> 33:54.560
barbarian. Please help, brothers. That's from Gmail. I don't think that's appropriate. I don't

33:54.560 --> 33:59.840
think it's ever appropriate, because then people don't even have to really smell anything. If they

33:59.840 --> 34:05.600
see you with your shoes off, you're Stinky Dave or whatever, Stinky Dylan. Yeah, or Kindergarten Dave.

34:05.600 --> 34:10.320
Like, go put your shoes in the cubby hole, you fucking toddler. No, this is a place of business.

34:10.320 --> 34:15.840
What if a client comes in? Hey, hey, listen. We've got a client coming into business today,

34:15.840 --> 34:20.480
and you have got to put your shoes on. He's not going to want to make business with us anymore

34:20.480 --> 34:25.200
if he sees you out there with no shoes. I think there's one way you can get away with this, though.

34:25.760 --> 34:33.120
Three words. Well, two words, and they're hyphenated. The first two. There are two

34:33.120 --> 34:38.640
hyphenated words, so that's one word. Can I guess what the three words are? You're

34:38.640 --> 34:45.040
going to guess them right away, so it won't even be fun. Okay, let me try. Imaginary shoe thief.

34:45.760 --> 34:51.520
No. Uh-huh. Good. Listen to this. You ready for this science, this knowledge?

34:52.480 --> 35:01.760
Gold toe socks. They're the business shoes of 2011. It's business cash, are these gold toe socks,

35:01.760 --> 35:06.320
because you can just let those puppies bark, and then your gold toe socks are even fancier than

35:06.320 --> 35:10.560
whatever loafers you wore into the office here. Can I just say that it took me a second to put

35:10.560 --> 35:13.120
together what you were talking about, and for some reason at first I thought you were talking

35:13.120 --> 35:17.680
about the socks that are like individual toes. No, no, no, no. So that you could wiggle your

35:17.680 --> 35:21.440
little toe fingers there, but they were colored gold, and that's what made it okay. That might

35:21.440 --> 35:26.800
be acceptable if you work at some sort of incense boutique. We're talking about a real

35:26.800 --> 35:31.360
place, a business place, where clients come to do business. If you're working at Stinky Sticks,

35:31.360 --> 35:36.560
then that's acceptable. If you're working at Stank and Smoke, then you can make that work for you.

35:36.560 --> 35:40.640
I think you're looking for Stank and Dank. Stank and Dank. If you're working at Stank and Dank,

35:41.440 --> 35:47.040
that's acceptable. Otherwise, go gold toe. Because those are the most expensive, that says,

35:47.040 --> 35:51.760
I'm ready for business. I've made a conscious aesthetic choice with my sock wear.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.920
What about socks that say, I'm ready for business?

35:55.280 --> 35:59.040
Just written on them, you mean? Yeah, and a little sock says, I'm ready,

35:59.040 --> 36:02.960
and the other one says, for business. You could also just write, you get a marker and

36:02.960 --> 36:08.960
write the words Calvin Klein on your regular socks. So then people know, hey, that guy's

36:08.960 --> 36:17.440
ready for business. Nice business socks, Dave. We haven't even considered sock garters. We

36:17.440 --> 36:23.680
didn't even think about those. That's a cool look. That's a business professional casual look.

36:23.680 --> 36:29.760
You've got your Birkin socks and socks and sock garters. There's a lot going on down there.

36:29.760 --> 36:36.000
For anyone to appreciate sock garters, he's got to be wearing shorts or rolled up khakis.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.880
You know what? Let's take it two more steps towards business cash, and we'll say jorts.

36:42.480 --> 36:46.320
We're saying jorts, we're saying gold toe socks, we're saying sock garters.

36:46.320 --> 36:50.880
Is a mesh athletic tee too far? Sleeves or no sleeves?

36:50.880 --> 36:54.480
No sleeves. I don't know. I think no sleeves is pushing it.

36:55.200 --> 36:59.120
Okay. Sleeves. You got to get everyone in the office to do it.

36:59.920 --> 37:05.600
Yeah. The more things we add, the more things we add, the harder it's going to be. If you just

37:05.600 --> 37:10.560
want to get everybody wearing gold toe socks, no problem. When you throw jorts and sock garters in

37:10.560 --> 37:15.120
the mix, you're going to have a hard time getting Debbie and accounting on board with that.

37:15.120 --> 37:22.960
Sure. Unless you brand them. If you put your company name on the sock garter-

37:22.960 --> 37:26.960
Are you grossed out by my lack of shoes? Good. I've got your attention. Here's the pitch.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.040
We put our thing on socks. Jorts.

37:31.040 --> 37:37.120
Jorts. Are you saying that this is a company that sells jorts? Because if that's the case,

37:37.120 --> 37:40.880
then I think that would be sort of complicit in their company guidelines,

37:40.880 --> 37:42.800
is that everyone has to wear their jorts all the time.

37:42.800 --> 37:49.680
Yeah. I think if your boss tries to hassle you, you say, hey, I'm Japanese, you bigot,

37:49.680 --> 37:54.400
or I'm half Japanese, depending on what you can pull off. Culturally, yeah.

37:55.440 --> 38:02.480
Justin, that may be, in a weird way, the most racist thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.640
Are you saying Japanese people only wear jorts?

38:06.640 --> 38:12.720
Why did jorts have to do this? Why didn't jorts figure it at all?

38:15.920 --> 38:19.120
Clearly, he was talking about the Asians love sock garters.

38:19.120 --> 38:22.880
He doesn't want to wear shoes in the office. So if you're not wearing shoes,

38:22.880 --> 38:26.480
then you can tell your boss you're your family is Japanese.

38:26.480 --> 38:29.440
You can't derail our above ground jorts train

38:29.440 --> 38:33.920
and then jump back to a thing we were talking about 10 minutes ago. We were on jorts.

38:33.920 --> 38:40.720
I'm trying to solve the problem. But telling him that you're trying to make your boss feel

38:40.720 --> 38:44.880
like he's not culturally sensitive is a good way to get him off your back.

38:44.880 --> 38:52.160
I am so angry at you right now. We were on a jorts tear. We were on a hot jorts streak.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.960
I'm 30 years old. I don't know what jorts are.

38:54.960 --> 39:01.280
They're jean shorts, you dumb dick. Use your context clues.

39:01.280 --> 39:05.040
It starts with J. What else starts with J? Jorts, you fucking racist.

39:05.040 --> 39:09.760
Forgive me for thinking that you would in some way be talking about the goddamn question at hand.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.520
Japanese shorts.

39:17.840 --> 39:21.920
This is the question that breaks our show up because you don't know what jorts are.

39:26.640 --> 39:30.800
That's really nice. That's a really nice shorts. Yeah, they got a cell phone in them.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.960
I got them in Japan. These shorts are a cell phone.

39:33.840 --> 39:37.200
They're also made of denim. Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.640
I see you buying my garters, sir.

39:42.640 --> 39:45.280
Respect my proud heritage. Eyes above the waist, please.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.840
If you don't wear pants, no one's going to notice that you're not wearing shoes.

39:48.480 --> 39:52.080
Just go naked waist down and be like, oh. This is where all our questions end.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.720
You guys notice that? What?

39:54.720 --> 39:59.680
I have a small problem, and we go from small solution to just get your whole dick out and

39:59.680 --> 40:01.040
we're nothing but sock garters.

40:02.720 --> 40:08.960
I think our strategy is sort of create a bigger problem that eclipses the smaller problem.

40:08.960 --> 40:12.400
Sure, sure, sure. It's like when you have a bug bite and then your dad breaks your arm

40:12.400 --> 40:14.960
so that you don't pay attention to the bug bite anymore.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.960
Exactly. Exactly.

40:19.040 --> 40:23.920
It's one strategy. You're not going to see Abby trying to get you to do it.

40:23.920 --> 40:27.280
You're not going to see Abby trying that one. She's going to attack the problem head on.

40:27.280 --> 40:31.040
We're going to sneak up behind it and slit its throat. That's our style. That's our way.

40:32.320 --> 40:36.320
I think our shit is pretty practical. I think that you roll up into your office wearing

40:36.320 --> 40:42.480
sock garters and gold toe socks and jorts and maybe long underpants under the jorts

40:43.600 --> 40:47.120
that everything's just going to be 100% copacetic.

40:47.120 --> 40:52.080
I am a guy in his early 20s, and I recently started using online dating.

40:52.080 --> 40:57.280
Within a week, I've scheduled three dates over the weekend with three seemingly very nice ladies.

40:57.280 --> 41:01.360
I've never been in this situation before, and I'm unsure if this is impolite.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.000
I haven't mentioned this to any of the girls I've gone on first dates with,

41:04.000 --> 41:07.200
and if I go on a third date with any of them, I'll turn down the others.

41:08.640 --> 41:12.080
Is there a proper etiquette for this situation? This is from Courteous in Colorado.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.000
You're playing a dangerous game, my friend.

41:14.000 --> 41:20.400
Yeah. You've got hoes in different web addresses, and this house of cards that you've built is going

41:20.400 --> 41:24.480
to collapse right on your head, and it's not going to hurt very much because it's made of cards, but

41:25.360 --> 41:27.040
it's going to hurt them.

41:27.040 --> 41:31.360
I think this is one of those things, like if you imagine that, okay, say that this turns into one

41:31.360 --> 41:36.160
of these women is the one, and you guys are together forever and get married and stuff.

41:36.160 --> 41:41.840
So the story you're going to tell is you were dating three girls at the same time and decided

41:41.840 --> 41:44.480
three girls at the same time and decided on this one forever.

41:44.480 --> 41:48.480
That's kind of nice, right?

41:48.480 --> 41:50.480
I had my choice of three, and I went with the...

41:50.480 --> 41:54.000
I had a golden corral of ladies, and I went with the steak.

41:55.200 --> 41:59.680
I think this is okay because statistically speaking, one's a guy. Like, one's a guy.

42:00.240 --> 42:05.040
Yeah, one out of three women is a guy. That's stats, basic stats.

42:05.680 --> 42:09.040
One is a guy pretending to be a girl on online dating because that's how he likes to

42:09.680 --> 42:11.520
get his jerk cookies.

42:11.520 --> 42:11.920
Exactly.

42:11.920 --> 42:15.760
One is a horse pretending to be a human, so good luck spying her.

42:16.480 --> 42:20.400
And one is a woman pretending to be a horse pretending to be a guy pretending to be a woman.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.520
So good luck.

42:21.520 --> 42:24.000
You cut through those layers enough, you're going to get something real nice.

42:25.840 --> 42:31.680
Basically a small, small, three-foot-tall woman operating a horse in a woman's suit

42:31.680 --> 42:33.840
with mechanics and stuff.

42:33.840 --> 42:37.120
It's going to look like a scene out of the Wizard of Oz, but a really bad Wizard of Oz.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.600
A really upsetting Wizard of Oz.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.720
You're not doing anything wrong. It's casual.

42:42.720 --> 42:46.000
Casual doesn't get much more casual than first dates.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.440
I do like that you've left that second date window just to see what happens.

42:49.440 --> 42:53.280
He's not going to tell them on the first date, and he will tell them on the third date,

42:53.280 --> 42:55.120
but on the second date, I don't know.

42:55.120 --> 42:58.880
He's not going to tell them that they're on a secret version of The Bachelor?

42:58.880 --> 43:03.120
I'm playing covert bachelor with you.

43:03.120 --> 43:07.120
It's The Bachelor meets Candid Camera, and it sucks. It's the suckiest show.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.280
Everybody just gets their feelings hurt.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.600
Victoria, I'm sorry that you have to leave the show.

43:12.560 --> 43:14.080
I don't understand what you're talking about.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.200
Excuse me? I'm on a what now?

43:17.200 --> 43:20.640
You just picked up a rose, and then you set it back down on the table without giving it to me,

43:20.640 --> 43:22.320
and I have no idea what's going on.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.360
I'm so confused.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.600
Who are those two other women? One of them looks pony-ish.

43:26.960 --> 43:31.600
One of them is my fourth-grade gym teacher, Mr. Perkins.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.880
We've got Mr. Perkins, and we've got a dog in a sundress,

43:36.880 --> 43:40.080
so I don't know what you're doing anymore. This is the best date I've ever been on.

43:42.080 --> 43:42.880
I'm glad we're at the mall.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.240
Can we go see Zookeeper and maybe get a pretzel?

43:48.240 --> 43:48.960
From Kanye.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.320
Griffin, gimme.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.040
Another Yahoo?

43:53.680 --> 43:54.960
Yeah, I think so.

43:54.960 --> 43:58.560
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield. Thank you, Lisa.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Emily W, who asks,

44:00.960 --> 44:06.400
Big tough dog names, please. I will be getting a big dog soon,

44:06.400 --> 44:10.000
and I need a tough, sexy, hot name to go with it, haha.

44:10.800 --> 44:14.880
Male and female names are okay. Please no Fluffy or Mr. Snuggles.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.360
It won't be amusing no matter how funny you think it might be.

44:17.360 --> 44:22.400
I won't care, so really. Some tough names for a tough dog, smiley face, thanks.

44:22.400 --> 44:29.920
She needs a tough, sexy, hot name for her tough, sexy, hot, male or female dog.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.000
Vin Diesel the dog.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.200
See, gee, my mind went to the very same place, Travis.

44:36.000 --> 44:36.480
Really?

44:36.480 --> 44:38.560
I swear to God, I was gonna say Diesel.

44:38.560 --> 44:42.560
What about Condoleezza Rice the dog? Cause she didn't take any gut from anybody.

44:42.560 --> 44:47.040
Oh, she is, she will, she will bite you, clean through your neck.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.680
Are there some suggestions for a name?

44:49.680 --> 44:52.960
You clean through your neck. Are there some suggestions?

44:52.960 --> 44:54.320
Did people have any good guesses?

44:55.920 --> 44:58.080
Um, Ichabod. No.

44:58.880 --> 44:59.200
What?

44:59.200 --> 44:59.760
Pirate.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.440
Fuck you.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.280
Zeus. Zeus is all right.

45:04.000 --> 45:04.960
Zeus is pretty good.

45:06.160 --> 45:07.360
Um, Buddy.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.640
What are you, that's not-

45:09.280 --> 45:10.560
That's like the opposite.

45:11.200 --> 45:11.760
Blaze.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.040
Ice.

45:15.040 --> 45:15.600
Laser.

45:15.600 --> 45:22.720
It's my dog, Turbo. He loves to have a metal ball and roll around.

45:23.680 --> 45:28.640
I think we're, I think we could come up with a hundred tough sounding dude names.

45:29.280 --> 45:37.840
What I think is really gonna be tricky is coming up with a hot, a tough, sexy, hot female dog name.

45:38.800 --> 45:39.200
Holly Hunt.

45:39.200 --> 45:46.960
Cause I see a female dog and I think, I think, you know, Daisy or something, something delicate.

45:46.960 --> 45:50.720
I don't think Laser or something like that.

45:50.720 --> 45:56.480
What about Kathleen Turner? She exudes strength, but still has that femininity.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.800
How about Kathy Bates?

46:00.800 --> 46:05.920
Kathy Bates, uh, maybe not as much with the sexy, but definitely tough, tough cookie.

46:05.920 --> 46:10.000
Uh, bite your tongue, sir.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.520
Have you seen Harry's Law?

46:14.480 --> 46:16.320
It's like you haven't even seen Misery.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.720
That shit is a femme d'amore's wet dream.

46:21.840 --> 46:22.400
Gross.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.320
I am creeped out.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.080
Snap these ankles, Kathy Bates.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.160
I have been a dirty birdie.

46:31.360 --> 46:32.400
Sure, I'll write a story.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.800
I'll write a story about how rock hard I am right now.

46:34.800 --> 46:39.040
It's going to take a full book to express how-

46:39.040 --> 46:41.920
You can hobble my legs, but you can't hobble this boner.

46:44.240 --> 46:49.840
I think that of those dog names, I feel like the best one, uh, is Snoopy.

46:49.840 --> 46:50.800
Now hear me out.

46:51.600 --> 46:51.920
Okay.

46:53.200 --> 46:56.240
It exudes strength because of the longevity.

46:56.880 --> 46:57.120
Yeah.

46:57.680 --> 47:00.160
And if you wanted R to outlast you, that's what Snoopy did.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.360
He outlived his creator.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.040
That's, that's strong.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.080
That's strength, right?

47:04.080 --> 47:08.400
And Snoopy, no one knows if Snoopy's a male dog or a female dog.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.880
Well, I would say that if it's female, you can go with Snooki.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.000
Okay.

47:14.000 --> 47:14.400
Sexy.

47:14.400 --> 47:17.200
Which, as everyone knows, is the female version of Snoopy.

47:18.400 --> 47:23.280
There's a whole, there's a whole world of reality television that we could, that we could dive into.

47:23.280 --> 47:23.760
Sure.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.000
Like-

47:24.000 --> 47:26.480
Oh, male or female, the situation.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.720
This is my dog, this is my dog Cake Boss.

47:28.720 --> 47:32.960
This is, this is my dog Countess Luanne de Lesseps.

47:35.840 --> 47:36.960
It's from Real Housewives.

47:37.520 --> 47:37.920
Oh yeah?

47:38.560 --> 47:39.840
Oh, tell me more.

47:41.200 --> 47:43.280

49:22.640 --> 49:30.960
And Twitter, thank you so much for, for, for talking about our show there.

49:30.960 --> 49:34.400
