WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.940 --> 00:49.940
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.220 --> 01:02.220
Better it's better

01:10.420 --> 01:15.700
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and I'm in the rice show for the modular

01:15.700 --> 01:20.700
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis macabre

01:22.260 --> 01:24.260
O'Roy, no

01:24.900 --> 01:26.900
Macabre sounds like it

01:27.820 --> 01:31.740
Yeah, and I'm I'm the I'm Griffin McElroy's bones

01:33.260 --> 01:40.320
It's the time where everybody starts changing their names on social media and stuff to be like their spooky like Halloween version their name

01:40.320 --> 01:42.320
And I've never come up with a good one

01:42.320 --> 01:46.960
Our name is is is difficult to terrorize

01:47.400 --> 01:54.800
Yeah, I've really thought about this in a long time and it gets it's it's like trying to pick it in August because it's instantly

01:54.800 --> 01:57.400
Sweaty, it's just as soon as you come up with something. It's

01:58.040 --> 02:00.040
one time at church camp

02:00.520 --> 02:05.200
Someone called me Gryffindor macaroni, and then I realized I would never scare anyone

02:05.480 --> 02:10.080
Yeah, I would never impose. I would never be scary or imposing or

02:10.080 --> 02:17.320
Impressive here. The mirror wasn't what tips you off to that. It was the Gryffindor McElroy moment. No Justin Gryffindor macaroni

02:18.120 --> 02:24.080
That would just want to make you say it again. Yeah, it's Travis McElroy anything. Is that scary?

02:24.080 --> 02:27.360
I don't wanna get some afraid of I'm afraid of being smacked. I don't

02:27.720 --> 02:33.160
I got smacked one time by a friend in middle school because I kept slapping the bottom of his

02:33.280 --> 02:35.960
Disposable camera to make the flash go off and he was worried

02:35.960 --> 02:42.760
I was gonna overexpose the film and he slapped my face and I pointed at him and I said don't ever touch me again

02:43.600 --> 02:46.200
walked out of the locker room where this

02:46.520 --> 02:51.820
Conflict happened and I just want to say Mike if you're listening name the time and place

02:52.640 --> 02:54.640
motherfucker

02:56.720 --> 03:01.760
Yeah, it's I've been sitting on this one I've been sitting on this one for 23 years

03:01.760 --> 03:03.760
What else you remember about Mike

03:04.840 --> 03:10.160
Well, he he did show me a pornographic magazine that belonged to his father

03:10.520 --> 03:16.120
We were in middle school and I don't I'm not going to give the brand of the magazine free publicity

03:16.560 --> 03:18.560
Safe to say that it was not

03:18.800 --> 03:23.920
the smoothest transition into my sexual awakening that

03:23.920 --> 03:31.920
There was possibly there there was other reading material that skipped a common advanced level of pornography there was

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
there was an anatomical

03:35.680 --> 03:37.680
realization that came before the

03:38.480 --> 03:42.680
Erotic one and it made and the two got real confuddled

03:45.560 --> 03:47.560
My 13 year old brain anyway

03:47.560 --> 03:54.880
Like psyche and then it just sort of took wrong turns in the different roads that they weren't supposed to head down

03:54.880 --> 03:58.720
Mike also gave me a heads up that I was being cheated on in college one time

03:58.720 --> 04:03.760
So I think we're square Mike keep keep on keep on going strong. We don't have to fight

04:05.200 --> 04:09.960
What are we doing? What do we do? What Mike? What are we talking about scary stuff Travis?

04:09.960 --> 04:17.560
Did you have a comment about scary things like the the beginning of the Halloween season or do you want to officially?

04:17.640 --> 04:25.160
Commence it because if you commit this is a problem with commencing Halloween season is that you have commit like that's the Christmas Creek

04:25.160 --> 04:29.320
I think I think and I have a strong stance on this if I

04:30.040 --> 04:34.400
That is shocking to me that I have a strong feeling about this the year part a holiday

04:34.400 --> 04:41.720
Benefits from the addition of decorations on your house, which I believe Halloween does it should start

04:42.440 --> 04:48.900
Earlier than a normal holiday season because the effort it would take to put up decorations

04:49.280 --> 04:54.560
Right should be rewarded with the time of them being viewed and appreciated

04:54.560 --> 05:00.040
So like I don't think you'd say like you can't put up Halloween decorations until like two weeks before that's too short

05:00.040 --> 05:02.560
I think a window of time of two months prior

05:02.560 --> 05:03.840
Oh

05:03.840 --> 05:05.840
As soon as we hit

05:06.400 --> 05:09.720
Listen, you can point at a calendar. Are you jabronis?

05:09.800 --> 05:16.640
Sorry for calling you jabronis and say the actual first day of fall is in like September

05:17.280 --> 05:21.520
21st or whatever and it's like yeah, man, but we all know September

05:21.520 --> 05:28.080
Timber first is false September is not a summer month if anybody out of context said, you know

05:28.080 --> 05:33.120
The summer months like June July August September. They'd be like, what are you talking about?

05:33.120 --> 05:37.400
And you're like, well the majority of September is summer get the fuck out

05:37.760 --> 05:42.920
Think about this way. Does anybody ever said oh my favorite winter holiday st. Patrick's Day. No

05:43.640 --> 05:45.880
No, it's not that's in the spring

05:46.520 --> 05:53.920
Guys, I love millennial Seinfeld as much as the next guy. But hey Griffin, are you just realizing that that's what this show is? I

05:53.920 --> 06:00.200
I hate Trav. I fucking refuse to accept that. There's no there's no way

06:01.800 --> 06:07.800
Okay, Griffin's in a mood. Let's talk about it Griffin's in a mood where Travis and I find Griffin in this

06:08.520 --> 06:10.520
sometimes where it's like I

06:11.240 --> 06:13.240
Don't like that joke

06:13.240 --> 06:19.240
I

06:19.240 --> 06:25.480
Prefer another joke. I don't have I don't I don't have an alternative joke

06:29.480 --> 06:37.960
Say I have this to say about Halloween the best Halloween innovation in the last decade has been the big skeleton that people I guess

06:37.960 --> 06:42.480
Have been buying at I don't know where you get big skeleton. It's kind of Halloween

06:42.480 --> 06:48.120
I don't think they have them at your local Costco the sign I at Lowe's yesterday

06:48.120 --> 06:55.560
There was a sign that was like one giant skeleton per customer. It's a real issue. So I do think that

06:57.160 --> 07:02.480
Mr. Biden if we could get one of those sent to every American household and

07:02.880 --> 07:07.720
Then there would be a date prescribed by the government that you do put your big skeleton out

07:07.720 --> 07:10.560
and then as you walk around the neighborhood, it reminds you that

07:10.560 --> 07:13.640
Trick-or-treat is coming. Costume kids are coming

07:14.640 --> 07:20.600
The grave just to keep that. Yeah, as a scary grave, then

07:21.600 --> 07:26.560
That's a holiday. I can get into I would also say I think Biden should pass an amendment

07:26.560 --> 07:32.480
That says like when you get your big skeleton up. No adorning it with any political statements

07:32.480 --> 07:36.800
No, we don't want him holding a sign or wearing a hat if you know what I mean

07:36.800 --> 07:42.160
Like this is a purely apolitical stance on skeleton awareness

07:43.120 --> 07:47.120
Maybe in Christmas. There's a sort of skin wrap

07:47.680 --> 07:53.680
You can put on it to make it look like a Jack Skellington put the beard on it. You put the hat on no

07:53.680 --> 07:55.680
I'm talking about a full

07:56.080 --> 07:57.040
epi

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
Like epidermis

07:59.040 --> 08:03.760
Sort of like a real skin when I say skin wrap. I don't mean a costume you put on the skeleton

08:03.760 --> 08:07.840
I mean you make it a real a real boy, but a Santa Claus

08:07.840 --> 08:11.360
Do you think that there was an original draft of Nightmare Before Christmas?

08:11.920 --> 08:17.360
While where they were like, well, I think I think Jack Skellington knows that Santa should be like rotund

08:17.360 --> 08:19.360
So what he's going to do is he's going to pop

08:19.680 --> 08:24.480
He's going to pop Santa's skeleton out of his butt and he's going to climb in there and wear a Santa suit

08:24.880 --> 08:30.320
And they said well save this for Tim Allen vehicle that's coming up and instead. Oh Justin's challenged by this idea

08:30.320 --> 08:37.600
Justin and I had to stand up to think about Santa Claus's skeleton. Here's what I'm thinking guys. Okay. I'm going to think about this

08:40.000 --> 08:46.800
No, no, no, no, this is like this is we're it's about we're about to get rich. Okay. Whoa. Whoa. Yeah, I know

08:49.520 --> 08:51.120
Big Santa

08:51.120 --> 08:53.120
Yeah, it's something I do sometimes

08:53.120 --> 08:55.120
Sure. Big

08:55.120 --> 09:04.080
Uh, Jack Skellington is something I do sometimes right? Yeah, but what about like like just what if the skeleton could just be a different big man?

09:04.640 --> 09:08.560
For every holiday. Yeah, sure, right. So like you have big skeleton

09:09.600 --> 09:11.600
That it's spooky, right?

09:12.060 --> 09:13.760
Christmas

09:13.760 --> 09:15.760
I mean makes it sound great

09:15.760 --> 09:21.520
Right you wrap the Santa suit on him done. Yeah, good huge robe beard scythe

09:21.520 --> 09:28.640
Father time sure. Are you like a diaper on the skeleton? He's like no save the diaper diaper

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
At midnight you rip the

09:32.240 --> 09:38.720
Toga off the skeleton and it's wearing a diaper now and now it's just like why do we have so many different huge men?

09:39.200 --> 09:42.480
Let's have one huge man that you dress up for any holiday

09:42.480 --> 09:49.360
You want veterans day make him a soldier memorial day now, but is there always a skeleton underneath memorial day back to us?

09:49.360 --> 09:54.720
back what yeah Travis that was going to be my joke before Travis did make sure to jump right in there and

09:54.960 --> 10:01.280
Cut that cut that off. Sorry. I was just I wasn't even making a joke. I'm imagining the transitional period where

10:02.080 --> 10:03.680
between each

10:03.680 --> 10:07.280
Holiday, you do have to strip it back to a skeleton

10:07.840 --> 10:11.520
And then dress it you're legally not allowed to do that while people are awake

10:12.160 --> 10:16.480
You have to go door to door and knock on everyone's door and say are you guys out and they'll say yeah

10:16.480 --> 10:20.400
And then you go and yeah, and you say tonight's my skeleton night

10:20.560 --> 10:25.280
So don't come out and do your skeleton because we can't see each other do it. These are Biden issued

10:25.600 --> 10:32.400
They call them they call them bitey bones because Biden said the pandemic's over. I got all this money

10:33.280 --> 10:34.960
We're gonna do bitey bones

10:34.960 --> 10:39.840
And everyone says all right, I'm ready and then the bitey bones just start showing up by the truckload

10:40.000 --> 10:45.680
Every household gets a bitey pre-asset pre-asset multi-family housing. Every family gets a bitey bone

10:45.680 --> 10:50.960
It's just a yard of skeletons outside. That's fun. Now. I do like it being pre-assembled and maybe like

10:51.440 --> 10:57.440
It's still kind of warm and the bones are moist and hot like real boat and Biden's like don't ask questions

10:57.600 --> 10:59.600
I got resources about the mighty bones

11:00.320 --> 11:05.440
Um, but let's just say I got a lot of these laying around in a certain area in the desert

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Hold on. Wait, hold on. Wait

11:08.000 --> 11:15.360
Okay. Yeah, they they say all religions can be on the bitey bones. It's no problem if you want to do

11:15.760 --> 11:22.560
Even if you belong or yeah, if if you belong to a religion that is like strictly anti-skeleton

11:23.040 --> 11:30.240
Yeah, it said then it's okay. It's still okay because you still okay. You got a special permission slip from President Biden

11:30.800 --> 11:33.520
Yeah, Biden says it's fine. These are a religious

11:34.140 --> 11:35.760
apolitical skeletons

11:35.760 --> 11:43.200
That you can dress up like anything you want you are making me so hugely uncomfortable not because you're standing but because you're kind of

11:44.080 --> 11:46.560
Rocking back and forth. This is like me stand

11:47.920 --> 11:53.940
Yeah, no, you look like you're a new judge on shark tank who does who very publicly does cocaine

11:55.680 --> 11:59.760
And maybe it's also made some bad investments and really needs this one to work out

12:00.720 --> 12:01.920
What?

12:01.920 --> 12:03.840
What where is that?

12:03.840 --> 12:06.880
Where is that episode of shark tank where you get the basketball player?

12:06.880 --> 12:13.520
Who's like this wealthy but and he's but he needs he really needs one of these to work and you say it's a sure thing

12:13.760 --> 12:15.760
It's a sure thing. It's a sure thing

12:16.800 --> 12:23.440
All right, I'm willing to invest 20 million dollars in your frog warmers and the other sharks like don't do no

12:23.680 --> 12:30.400
Hey, can't they can't accept that much money. It's like don't do this. It's a sure thing. They said so everyone's gonna want a frog warmer

12:30.400 --> 12:34.160
20 million dollars for 500 percent of frog warmers

12:35.600 --> 12:36.800
Let it ride

12:36.800 --> 12:42.560
Let it ride baby. Let's see where this thing takes us. This is a this is an advice show where we uh,

12:43.040 --> 12:45.600
You ask us a question you send it to

12:46.460 --> 12:50.480
Mbmbam at maximum fun.org and then we answer it. It's like not a big

12:51.280 --> 12:55.280
It doesn't it doesn't have to be a big thing. Don't make like yeah, don't make like an issue out of it. Okay?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.440
um

12:57.440 --> 13:03.680
I'm currently studying elementary education and I have a lot of experience working with kids on reading slash writing

13:04.240 --> 13:08.880
In july my coworker and I began discussing the possibility of me tutoring his son in reading

13:09.200 --> 13:13.120
He kept setting dates for us to meet for a tutoring session and then changed the date at the last minute

13:13.440 --> 13:15.440
Eventually, he ended up sending me a hundred dollars

13:15.840 --> 13:18.880
I guess to hold himself accountable to actually following through with tutoring

13:19.280 --> 13:22.880
It is now september and I still have not tutored his son

13:22.880 --> 13:27.200
The money is still in my venmo account and we haven't discussed the tutoring topic in weeks

13:27.440 --> 13:31.280
I would very much like this money. Is there a point where it's okay for me to take the money?

13:31.600 --> 13:36.000
Should I send it back? That's from broken birmingham. Oh my god. I feel like

13:36.560 --> 13:41.200
I'm hearing the opposite side of most interactions people have had with me

13:41.600 --> 13:43.360
And it's very very stressful to me

13:43.360 --> 13:47.920
I feel like i've been this other person and i've been thinking i'm sure they're not thinking about this anymore

13:48.000 --> 13:50.800
Right because right i'm just i'm just feeling guilty about it all the time

13:50.800 --> 13:54.480
But they've probably forgotten and this question is like I haven't forgotten justin

13:54.880 --> 13:56.320
And not only that

13:56.320 --> 13:57.760
I was confused

13:57.760 --> 14:03.680
By what you thought was a very clear indicator that the transaction was over because that's what I assumed the hundred dollars is

14:03.680 --> 14:08.800
Is like you know what? This isn't gonna happen, but I feel so bad that I jerked this person's chain

14:09.120 --> 14:11.520
So like i'm just gonna like give them the money

14:11.600 --> 14:15.920
We agreed on that does feel like somebody was like I can't be guiltless. I can't feel bad about this anymore

14:15.920 --> 14:21.680
Or maybe if I just do my part, they'll just find a chance and just find dirk somewhere in an alley and tutor him

14:21.760 --> 14:26.560
I don't know. Maybe let's seek him out some tutoring on the fly. Hey, are you really good?

14:26.880 --> 14:27.840
Okay

14:27.840 --> 14:32.000
They never arranged the tutoring but then dirk just started like crushing it with everything

14:32.080 --> 14:37.360
He tried to be like, I guess he's tutoring somewhere. I don't know about it, but i'll send him a hundred bucks just to be safe

14:38.560 --> 14:43.520
This is a breach of etiquette. I feel like there there needs to be a law

14:43.520 --> 14:45.520
about sending people

14:45.840 --> 14:51.120
Funds and maybe i'm just saying this because people have sent me funds and then be like and now what are you gonna do?

14:51.200 --> 14:53.200
About that the money I have sent you

14:54.080 --> 14:55.360
uh

14:55.360 --> 14:56.000
It's a breach

14:56.000 --> 15:01.120
It's so it's not a nice thing to do to just send somebody money and be like you figure out what you need to do

15:01.200 --> 15:03.760
For me now, it's you clearly owe me one

15:04.560 --> 15:07.440
Figure out what that is. No, I guess you have the expectation

15:07.440 --> 15:13.520
It is a weird inverse of capitalism if there's an expectation that you will be repaid in some way for you

15:13.600 --> 15:19.040
Because I was gonna say giving money to people that's fine. Right? We could we're still fine with that. That's okay

15:19.600 --> 15:23.360
Yeah, for sure. Okay, but if you're expecting something in return that's the problem

15:23.600 --> 15:26.080
I think also this money is yours, right?

15:26.160 --> 15:33.280
Because here's the thing you take that money at any point if your co-worker is like, hey, so when are we gonna schedule that thing?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.280
right

15:35.280 --> 15:39.680
You already have the money and if your co-worker never brings it up again, you already have the money

15:40.000 --> 15:45.680
Yeah, you should take does vinmo you have to like take the money. No, you sadly it's in your account

15:47.680 --> 15:52.880
Give it to you. Um, so here's what I need you to do, uh get on

15:53.980 --> 16:00.320
craigslist or if you really want to turn a quick buck on this fiber, um and find a

16:01.040 --> 16:02.480
reading tutor

16:02.480 --> 16:04.000
for this boy

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah, but get in there

16:06.800 --> 16:08.800
at the lowest

16:08.960 --> 16:10.960
possible price point

16:11.120 --> 16:13.680
that you can't find somebody who's just like

16:14.640 --> 16:17.520
It's 20 bucks, but I only do consonants

16:18.000 --> 16:23.280
Uh, and then and then you and then you have just made you've turned a quick profit

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
while also

16:26.000 --> 16:27.680
not

16:27.680 --> 16:32.080
Fully ripping this person off because now you're just like a tutor eight you're a tutoring agent

16:32.080 --> 16:37.840
Well to the stars the answer is simple if dirks in like third grade you hire a fourth grader to tutor dirk

16:38.160 --> 16:44.240
And then it's one reading level above that and like 10 bucks a fourth grader love 10 bucks

16:45.180 --> 16:47.600
Absolutely, they would fourth graders love 10 bucks

16:49.280 --> 16:50.480
Justin what are you looking at?

16:50.480 --> 16:56.800
You look really lost in thought i was thinking about a story that is related to this that I wanted to share with y'all

16:58.160 --> 16:59.840
I don't cut my own grass

16:59.840 --> 17:04.160
Yeah, I do most of the things in my house, but that's one thing that I decided like i'm gonna pay somebody to cut

17:04.160 --> 17:10.240
My grass because I don't I hate I hate cutting grass. I you have definitely told us about your grass boy

17:10.880 --> 17:13.120
That does your your okay. So, um

17:14.000 --> 17:16.560
the my grass gentleman he cut uh, uh

17:17.280 --> 17:19.280
I came home and he cut half the lawn

17:20.160 --> 17:24.720
And he said he texted me and he said hey, i'm sorry that I only cut half the lawn

17:25.280 --> 17:27.520
My partner who usually helps me

17:27.520 --> 17:29.520
Um died

17:29.600 --> 17:35.440
And i've it's been really hard keeping up. I said, oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'll tell you what

17:35.520 --> 17:39.120
let me go and send you the money for the for this cutting and then

17:39.680 --> 17:43.600
You know whenever you can get back over to finish. It's like no big deal. He's like, thank you so much

17:44.800 --> 17:47.840
But that was like a couple weeks ago now, right? So

17:49.120 --> 17:53.360
Well now i'm in this situation where not it's not that my grass is long

17:53.360 --> 17:57.360
Yeah, it's that half of my grass is really long

17:58.000 --> 18:00.880
there's two options for me, right one is

18:01.840 --> 18:03.120
Are you still?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.120
How's it go? How's it going?

18:06.080 --> 18:10.720
With everything with them. Yeah with the with the everything or it's just like

18:11.360 --> 18:14.800
Find someone else to do it and then he shows up. He's like god damn

18:15.280 --> 18:20.320
Can one thing go right? I got scooped god. I cannot catch a break

18:20.320 --> 18:24.720
Like so now i'm kind of in between those two positions and I don't really know

18:24.880 --> 18:30.420
I don't have my brother my brother and me, you know what I mean? You do have two brothers people forget the pagliacci

18:32.720 --> 18:38.480
That we that we are in like what would you guys do in my position I don't it shouldn't this is so key

18:39.040 --> 18:41.040
I don't own a lawn mower

18:41.120 --> 18:47.600
Like I don't I don't have one. I have a weed whacker for when I need to get some intense work done

18:47.600 --> 18:51.680
But I don't have a lawn mower. Do you have a big pair of scissors for me?

18:54.080 --> 19:00.640
Yeah, I had a lot of good some good ripping gloves I do have two kids yeah, there you go

19:01.840 --> 19:04.560
Yeah, have them eat the grass like goats

19:05.440 --> 19:10.240
Get up there eat the grass like goats. You should just text the lawn mower person like hey, let's schedule the next time

19:10.240 --> 19:14.400
You're able to come out. Are you still by yourself? We could schedule it over two days if that helps

19:14.400 --> 19:17.760
Yeah, that's good trap. Yeah, it's not a joke

19:17.760 --> 19:20.720
But I can see that this is really bothering my older brother and I wanted to help

19:21.440 --> 19:24.560
You could say like I know you had trouble with the right side of the yard

19:24.960 --> 19:29.920
But I want you to know that it's basically just like the left side of the yard, but backwards does that help?

19:31.120 --> 19:32.880
Does that help?

19:32.880 --> 19:39.440
Your assumption driven is that the loss of the partner made it impossible to do both halves not because it was a time issue

19:39.440 --> 19:43.920
But because when he reached the middle boy, he's like i've never done over there before

19:44.240 --> 19:48.560
I I had got to a point where I almost asked if I could borrow

19:49.680 --> 19:51.600
his lawn mower

19:51.600 --> 19:56.240
um, so I could do it, but then I worried there was a reality where she's like

19:56.880 --> 19:59.360
That was real good. I have one other yard

20:01.040 --> 20:03.040
Are you looking for a side gig

20:03.120 --> 20:07.120
It's like I do three or four yards because I feel so guilty that it's like wait a minute

20:07.120 --> 20:11.520
I think I work for this guy now and then you find that it's your new passion and it's just like oh

20:11.520 --> 20:16.560
What do I tell my brothers? How about another you guys want another question? Yeah. Yeah, you know what I really do

20:17.280 --> 20:20.160
Or you know how we've been talking about starting our own band. Yeah

20:20.720 --> 20:21.680
Yeah

20:21.680 --> 20:23.280
The wizard had some help

20:23.280 --> 20:27.760
For us eric sent this one in and it's how to find an interesting name for your band

20:28.320 --> 20:32.480
And it can't be the mackerel brothers because that's actually taken I found out recently

20:32.480 --> 20:39.120
There's like three mackerel brothers who do I believe it's called commercial rock or something, which doesn't seem like a thing

20:40.480 --> 20:46.720
Well, we do kind of commercial rock do we like we well we have sponsors on the show and I think that our

20:47.680 --> 20:49.120
comedy style

20:49.120 --> 20:55.680
Really rocks. Well, we've covered we do scatting we do jingles. Yeah, um, we've done some musicals

20:56.960 --> 20:59.440
Yeah, but we really shred these jokes

20:59.440 --> 21:04.640
Are you looking for a catchy name for your band the name your band chooses can make the difference between success and failure

21:05.360 --> 21:08.720
I think anecdotally I can think of a few bands that

21:09.440 --> 21:16.400
Have some of the worst names i've ever heard in my life that managed to really take off. Yeah, um and find a lot of success

21:16.960 --> 21:18.800
like cold play

21:18.800 --> 21:24.000
I that's not that doesn't mean anything. Anyway learning the rules of good band names keep it short

21:24.400 --> 21:27.360
Think about it. How many band names do you know that are more than three words long?

21:27.360 --> 21:31.120
Not many. That's the rule of thumb. No more than three words long

21:31.680 --> 21:33.680
You want people to be able to spell and pronounce your name?

21:33.680 --> 21:37.120
Mostly you just want people to be sure they remember it. Can you abbreviate your band name easily?

21:37.440 --> 21:41.520
That can be helpful for merchandising purposes. That's one reason that nine inch nails chose its name

21:42.800 --> 21:49.200
Can we just all three i'm just gonna a quick test here off the top of your head. What's the most memorable band name?

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
We're gonna i'm gonna count down from three

21:51.600 --> 21:55.680
Uh and on go say the most memorable band name. Okay, you ready?

21:55.680 --> 22:01.200
Wait, the most memorable band name? Yeah, the band like when you think of a band name, right?

22:01.360 --> 22:04.080
What what the first one the band itself, right? Like

22:05.040 --> 22:07.520
Yeah, the work the just the name of the band

22:08.240 --> 22:14.160
Right. Ready? Three two one go who cherry pop and daddy's is not a band

22:14.800 --> 22:18.160
Is a singer now justin you say hubastank. That's a good hubastank

22:18.800 --> 22:25.200
Hubastanks, i'll know that for the rest of my life. I'll never not know hubasek and i said cherry pop and daddies, which is uh,

22:25.200 --> 22:32.160
Horrible, obviously obviously here also, that's so interesting, uh to hear you say and it's not the first time

22:33.760 --> 22:40.000
God it's memorable really sticks in now griffin. You said a human being's name. Am I correct? Yeah, that felt fucked up

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
Because this is a real person

22:43.920 --> 22:46.560
Ingleborg happening. Yeah, yeah

22:47.040 --> 22:51.920
Okay, I would say red hot chili peppers because it's i'll tell you why four words four words

22:51.920 --> 22:57.040
This is a part-time job to say the name of this band. Yeah, I have things to I have shit to do today

22:57.360 --> 22:58.960
I have two children

22:58.960 --> 23:01.520
I can't go around saying red hot chili peppers all the time

23:02.000 --> 23:05.200
Just then when I said it I almost fell asleep in the middle of it

23:05.520 --> 23:10.640
I almost needed a glass of water in the middle of saying the name of that band. They should just call it red hot pep

23:11.680 --> 23:17.520
Or just the peppers. Oh, that's good. It'd be a better name for the band about it anthony

23:17.520 --> 23:22.080
What's up anthony? What's up anthony? Hit me up. I got all kinds and friends

23:22.560 --> 23:27.760
Kitas I got all kinds of great ideas for you pals. Yeah, there you go aunt flea and the rest

23:29.040 --> 23:32.320
That's some four words damn it. You're right aunt flea rest

23:33.040 --> 23:35.040
Aunt flea, etc, etc

23:35.680 --> 23:40.720
Make your uh, make your name seo friendly these days you want your name to be easily findable when you search on the internet

23:40.880 --> 23:42.880
Names are too common who bestang?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.080
I'm, pretty sure

23:46.080 --> 23:52.880
Every one of these bits in this question or wiki how article we could just say who bestang. Yeah, who was thanks

23:52.960 --> 23:57.200
Well, it's like a good name for a band. Like I don't know anything about the band, but it's a good name for a band

23:57.580 --> 23:59.580
memorable short

23:59.760 --> 24:03.600
Avoid anything with very negative connotations. You have to know how far you can

24:06.240 --> 24:08.240
The one I sets out

24:09.840 --> 24:11.840
You have to know how far you can push it

24:11.840 --> 24:16.960
Okay, wait, wait, does who was saying qualifier or this is like hooba has no

24:17.600 --> 24:21.120
I don't think it has well. Yeah, I guess stank and no I think that stank is right

24:21.280 --> 24:27.840
Stank's not good. Like hooba like but hooba hooba disarms you. Yeah, hooba as a as a qualifier

24:27.840 --> 24:31.760
Hooba has his arms up. It looks like grimace. It's as arson like come here, buddy

24:32.080 --> 24:34.080
And then it's like stank is in the back

24:34.640 --> 24:35.920
Yeah

24:35.920 --> 24:39.920
Corn's a fun name. I know we talk about we're a bunch of bad ass seo though

24:39.920 --> 24:44.720
Well, except you spell with a k so that's assuming you know that in this day and age gripping

24:44.720 --> 24:46.400
You can't assume people know

24:46.400 --> 24:50.400
Because maybe they just hear it and then they're just talking to alexa and they're like alexa play corn

24:50.560 --> 24:53.520
And then it plays that corn song from tiktok. You're like, no, no, no the one that goes

24:55.600 --> 24:58.160
And alexa's like i've called the doctor for you

24:59.680 --> 25:01.280
Um

25:01.280 --> 25:05.920
I didn't know if there really is a corn song from tiktok, but it sounds

25:05.920 --> 25:10.640
It sounds right. That sounds like something tiktok would have on it. You don't know about the corn boy song

25:11.440 --> 25:16.800
Find a name that's fresh. You want to avoid band names that are cliched now because of because they were trends a long time ago

25:16.800 --> 25:20.960
It's passe to add a number to your name boys two men seems so not now

25:21.660 --> 25:26.000
Acronyms are out think in sync putting an exclamation point at the end of your name will date you too

25:26.240 --> 25:30.960
Adding an extra d or t on the end of a name is kind of cliched avoid it think rat

25:32.080 --> 25:33.040
rat

25:33.040 --> 25:36.240
rats ratatouille, uh

25:36.960 --> 25:41.440
Develop a vision for your band that one we've already done. Uh pop young

25:42.060 --> 25:44.060
spirited, um

25:44.400 --> 25:46.400
Hip now

25:46.400 --> 25:48.000
sexy

25:48.000 --> 25:52.480
And these are words that we can take and fold. Sorry. I was saying that for the band name

25:53.680 --> 25:58.080
Yeah, no, that's what i'm saying. So sexy coldplay would be a good one a better one

26:00.560 --> 26:02.560
Too many words it's it's pop

26:02.560 --> 26:07.840
Well coldplay lets you know that it's going to be pop because this band has coldplay in it. Yeah coldplay with a k

26:08.080 --> 26:09.680
Is that anything?

26:09.680 --> 26:14.000
Hot hot play hot work. We've talked about hot work before we have made that no way

26:17.040 --> 26:22.560
So find a word with meaning to you combine it with something perhaps your favorite candy bar the name of your girlfriend from

26:23.040 --> 26:28.880
High school your hometown all these are words you could add to a band name or just uses one now

26:28.880 --> 26:32.720
I assume when it says name of your girlfriend for high school. It doesn't mean like full name

26:35.200 --> 26:38.180
Samantha davis three musketeers

26:42.000 --> 26:44.880
Cindy score cindy score's not a bad name for a

26:45.600 --> 26:47.520
love a score bar

26:47.520 --> 26:52.160
I don't know that I thought that that was a I thought that that was a dipping tobacco. It's like a thinner heath bar

26:52.880 --> 26:55.200
I thought it was the one what's the one that oh zero?

26:55.200 --> 27:00.640
Oh, that's what I was thinking of with the nougat from the white chocolate use a pop culture or literary reference

27:02.320 --> 27:06.720
Mikey way was working in the barns and noble and saw the book by Irvine Welsh entitled three tales of chemical romance

27:06.800 --> 27:09.120
And then he came up with the name of the band

27:09.840 --> 27:16.160
Coldplay, this is my band the so so gatsby's that's a pretty good name for a band. Thank you. Thank you

27:17.040 --> 27:22.960
They're definitely I can't decide if they're emo or punk, but they're one of those two. Can you do screamo?

27:22.960 --> 27:30.240
I always thought that was fun. Yeah, I can dude. Yeah screamo. That's perfect get inspiration from common products or things flowers food sewing machines

27:30.320 --> 27:33.440
You name it look around the house. You'll find a lot of common things with interesting names

27:33.980 --> 27:35.980
Acdc got their name from a sewing machine

27:36.880 --> 27:38.880
Food names can also make good band names

27:40.240 --> 27:44.400
That's what it's short for now a lot of people know that's what the h that's what the h stands for

27:45.360 --> 27:49.120
Food names can also make good band names think black eyed peas or red hot chili peppers

27:49.120 --> 27:53.760
So which one is it wiki? Which one of those is a good name?

27:54.160 --> 27:58.880
Can we stay take a step back because right now you're telling me that red hot chili peppers is a good band name

27:58.960 --> 28:04.640
But let me red hot chili peppers. That's four. Are you sure red hot's not one word?

28:05.600 --> 28:11.040
Isn't there a candy called red hots and they're just the one word. Oh, that's right. And anthony keyda stated somebody named chili peppers

28:12.480 --> 28:14.480
high school

28:14.800 --> 28:16.080
Um

28:16.080 --> 28:20.880
Pick a random name. Thanks. That's nothing sure use your own name or your initials

28:21.360 --> 28:24.000
This is always a possibility, especially if your band has a front man

28:24.000 --> 28:28.240
For example, the dave matthews band is simply based on one of the band members

28:29.280 --> 28:34.960
What oh my god that makes so much it's never clicked for me before so wait

28:35.200 --> 28:40.320
His name is dave. There's a real dave matthews. I thought it was like hooting the blowfish

28:40.720 --> 28:43.280
Do you think that there was ever a moment when they were coming out and he was like?

28:43.280 --> 28:47.840
what if we just called it the dave matthews band and they're like, uh dave, uh

28:48.240 --> 28:51.200
I'm, not sure we were we were talking about a bunch of cool names

28:51.280 --> 28:57.680
Yeah, but wouldn't it be similar if we just called it dave matthews band and like I don't think it would dave

28:58.960 --> 29:00.720
um

29:00.720 --> 29:03.600
So make up a new word is another one and they give the example

29:03.680 --> 29:07.040
Metallica is the example of a band with a name that is a made-up word drummer lulz ulrich

29:07.360 --> 29:12.160
Made up made it up while thinking about a metal magazine. That's a pretty cool. I wish I could live inside that man's

29:12.160 --> 29:14.000
wonderful

29:14.000 --> 29:15.120
fucking

29:15.120 --> 29:19.520
Imaginarium of fucking dr. Parnassus my palace that he's got going on in there

29:19.600 --> 29:25.680
It also says create a new word by misspelling a common word like corn, but that's taken unless

29:26.160 --> 29:28.800
We wanted to do like k a u r

29:30.240 --> 29:35.760
Okay, what about this this is the name of our band it's not it is what about corn with the c oh

29:35.760 --> 29:43.120
Oh, oh I like that what's up everybody we're a corm did you say corm?

29:46.240 --> 29:50.480
Zing zap a z ziba ziba, this is my band pooba stay

29:52.160 --> 29:58.960
Are you teddy like what what did you say? Oh, man, um, make

29:58.960 --> 30:04.960
Make sure someone else doesn't have your name. It would be a night

30:14.480 --> 30:21.120
Wait, which one did you say I said corm can we be corn? How are you spelling it with a k? Yeah, it's fine

30:21.120 --> 30:30.560
I can't see how that would be confusing at all. That was a competing band. Jonathan Davis started corn and a friend of his started corm

30:31.280 --> 30:34.400
And corm was already on the rise corn had been on the scene for like two years

30:34.400 --> 30:37.840
Corm had a c in the beginning but an m at the end

30:38.240 --> 30:44.400
They were heading up and Jonathan Davis was like, I guess the thing that you need is for your band to be named after corm

30:45.280 --> 30:49.440
Uh juice. I'm sorry for this one determine if the domain name is available

30:49.440 --> 30:55.600
So corm.gov is hoomastank.com taken. It's got to be right

30:56.720 --> 30:58.720
corm.com is available

31:00.000 --> 31:03.120
That's gonna be a big ask though because it does look a lot like corn

31:04.240 --> 31:11.840
I I can't imagine how it could be confusing. It's corn with an m it's different in every way develop more than one band name

31:11.920 --> 31:18.560
No, fuck you. No, we have we struck gold here and then trademark your band name with the united states patent office

31:18.560 --> 31:20.560
I don't is that

31:22.800 --> 31:26.560
It took you a while to find that button because I know you didn't program that last time

31:26.720 --> 31:31.760
Yeah, we talked about it last time but i'd switch the pads over. I know isn't that sad?

31:32.160 --> 31:34.960
I feel like if we're gonna continue to or get now that

31:35.760 --> 31:38.720
That came organically like do we just maybe?

31:39.520 --> 31:46.240
Think about that corn is a lot more than other people do or are we just the only ones willing to talk about it

31:46.240 --> 31:48.420
It's 2022

31:49.520 --> 31:50.960
so

31:50.960 --> 31:52.960
much stuff

31:53.520 --> 31:59.280
Bad stuff. Yeah bad stuff has happened. Yeah since corn came on the scene

32:00.000 --> 32:06.720
That it makes the fact that there was a band called corn that had a song that sounded like goomba

32:08.400 --> 32:09.920
Really

32:09.920 --> 32:11.920
Really funny to me

32:11.920 --> 32:17.760
Yeah, like it's like we look back and it's like there were some bad there were some bad times in there

32:18.320 --> 32:20.000
and then right before

32:20.000 --> 32:24.480
It's like when people had to sit through hippies and stuff and they're like I miss when music was like

32:27.360 --> 32:30.000
No now for us it's I miss when music was like

32:31.920 --> 32:39.920
It's not even the music that I missed travis it was a more whimsical time. Oh, yeah a simpler and better time

32:39.920 --> 32:44.080
Last time I wanted to make an announcement about the band corn. Okay

32:46.000 --> 32:47.120
Last time

32:47.120 --> 32:52.560
Uh, we talked about corn, which it's i'm sure it's been months now. Sorry, which band dressing corn or quorum?

32:52.880 --> 32:57.840
Sorry, this is about corn and it is from last week. Okay, I mentioned, um heady

32:58.720 --> 33:03.760
But the basis of corn is the name fieldy as several listeners kindly corrected me

33:04.080 --> 33:08.100
A lot of real cornos in the audience and I did not know that a lot of cornographers

33:08.100 --> 33:12.900
And I am uh, i'm so sorry to run afoul. Mr. Fieldy if you're listening

33:13.620 --> 33:14.980
um

33:14.980 --> 33:18.980
I'm, so sorry. There's no way anyone in that band listens to podcasts not one of them

33:19.620 --> 33:25.860
There's no way anyone in corn listens to popcorn with a k i'm talking about now. You understand that not quorum

33:26.740 --> 33:28.340
No, there's no way

33:28.340 --> 33:30.340

You

38:19.740 --> 38:21.100
Uh, here's another question

38:21.100 --> 38:25.100
I'm a high school teacher and I just had a student tell me that I look like a trail mix

38:25.500 --> 38:30.620
I don't really know what he meant by this, but I know he intended it as an insult. What could he have possibly meant?

38:30.700 --> 38:37.660
Why do I feel so deeply offended by this comment? What course of punishment does this deserve? I can't stop thinking about it

38:37.660 --> 38:43.100
That's from muddled in missouri. Now. There's two. I think there's two assets devastating. Yeah, it's devastating

38:43.980 --> 38:50.060
I mean, it's so devastating my guess as to why it cuts too deep is that you are a person who has

38:50.620 --> 38:56.940
Multiple times in your life eaten trail mix, but you do not like make it an everyday habit

38:57.340 --> 38:59.500
So you can't outright deny it

39:00.380 --> 39:05.820
But it does seem like they've peeked deep into your soul to know so that like I know that in your deepest darkest hours

39:05.820 --> 39:08.220
When no one's around you eat trail mix

39:08.780 --> 39:13.180
And it's just like this is I have eaten trail mix before. Yeah, you're right. I do eat trail mix

39:13.740 --> 39:15.740
This is what terrifies me

39:16.140 --> 39:17.340
about

39:17.340 --> 39:19.420
Getting older is I don't know

39:20.380 --> 39:22.460
What the thing is that I do?

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
that I will be

39:26.060 --> 39:28.060
utterly humiliated for

39:28.860 --> 39:32.940
And it'll be a totally innocuous thing like eating trail mix

39:33.740 --> 39:34.540
um

39:34.540 --> 39:37.260
but then somebody will point it out and that person will be

39:38.060 --> 39:43.900
Half my age and they'll point it out to their friends and they'll all laugh and then they'll get on their hover skates or whatever and

39:44.780 --> 39:45.820
drift off

39:45.820 --> 39:48.300
Um, and i'll be left standing there like wondering

39:49.340 --> 39:52.220
Everything about my life why I live the way I live. Um

39:53.660 --> 39:55.660
This is a terrifying question to me

39:56.140 --> 39:57.100
Yeah

39:57.100 --> 40:02.300
I would also I would find myself immediately as soon as like their back was turned or I could get away from them

40:02.300 --> 40:09.100
Googling like is eating trail mix slang for something. Is this is eating trail mix bad to do now?

40:09.340 --> 40:14.700
Is this like from a meme where there's like a cartoon squirrel that eats trail mix and then like shits themselves like what?

40:15.260 --> 40:18.060
What is this in reference to it can't just be?

40:19.020 --> 40:21.500
Trail mix, right? That's the can't be no

40:22.620 --> 40:24.860
I've always thought of trail mix as a very neutral

40:25.580 --> 40:29.740
food like who wouldn't enjoy trail mix there's something for everyone in there and

40:29.740 --> 40:32.140
And how could it become a bad thing?

40:32.700 --> 40:37.820
Is it about nuts? It's got to be something about nuts, right? Nuts are in there. Are they saying that I

40:38.780 --> 40:42.860
Like to have nuts like a testicle. Is it a testicles thing guys gotta be testicles

40:42.940 --> 40:47.420
You gotta tell me the testicle thing because it can't be the chocolate candy part. Everybody loves that

40:47.500 --> 40:50.620
No, everybody loves that. They love raisins. They're not telling me I

40:51.180 --> 40:54.860
I mean it's the seeds. It's the seeds. It's weird to have seeds in the thing

40:55.420 --> 40:57.420
Because you plant those you're not supposed to eat them

40:57.420 --> 41:03.500
How stupid why don't I have any seeds for so long? Fuck they're right. They're right. They're right. They're right. I should expel them

41:04.780 --> 41:08.780
Before anyone else finds out my secret gets out seed eater

41:10.780 --> 41:15.980
Never come back to this school again. You just you just couldn't wait. Could you seed eater?

41:16.380 --> 41:18.780
Gotta plant this belly like a sloppy little monster

41:19.900 --> 41:21.900
loves his seeds

41:22.220 --> 41:24.220
You look like you eat trail mix

41:24.220 --> 41:27.740
Oh fuck it does hurt because it's so there's no

41:28.700 --> 41:34.140
There's no implication whatsoever. So the mind just reaches for the worst thing

41:34.460 --> 41:40.700
It's an insult that is like it impregnates itself like I don't know. What's the worst thing you think about yourself? Yeah, right

41:42.220 --> 41:47.660
Have you considered that you eat trail mix being the worst thing about yourself you look like you like trail mix

41:47.740 --> 41:49.820
I do have commitment issues. Yeah

41:49.820 --> 41:56.880
Yeah, why how did you get there? Is it are they okay? The best I can figure is that you you have a crunchy aesthetic?

41:57.340 --> 41:59.340
and by which I mean not because of

42:00.060 --> 42:02.060
all of the

42:02.440 --> 42:07.340
Toothsome legumes that you're shoveling into your mouth during your your lunch hour

42:07.900 --> 42:15.100
But i'm more talking about sort of your hiking your you you eat trail mix because you find yourself

42:15.820 --> 42:17.820
on trails a lot

42:17.820 --> 42:19.980
oh, you're just like a kind of a

42:20.620 --> 42:24.700
A trail junkie, but it can't be that you actually have that lifestyle

42:24.780 --> 42:29.260
Like you're not bringing your hiking backpack to class because you're hitting the trails afterwards

42:29.340 --> 42:34.380
It's like you wore a flannel and a knitted beanie once and they're like, oh, okay

42:35.100 --> 42:37.420
Ah, you're like this idea in your head where?

42:38.300 --> 42:44.380
When a teacher comes to school, they leave no hints whatsoever of the type of person that they are

42:44.380 --> 42:50.300
Are you kidding me? That's all I would do the yeah, that's what i'm saying. Travis. Yeah

42:51.100 --> 42:57.260
Because you're saying you would cloak your shit so that your kids would never know anything about you. Yes

42:57.900 --> 43:00.860
How are you supposed to connect? How are you supposed to connect? I don't want griffin

43:01.020 --> 43:03.260
We've already established the idea of connect

43:03.260 --> 43:08.780
Maybe that's it is like you've cloaked your shit so good the best they can infer is like

43:08.940 --> 43:11.100
I don't know trail mix something about trail mix

43:11.100 --> 43:15.020
I think I saw them eating m&ms once and it reminded me of trail mix

43:15.180 --> 43:15.980
I don't know man

43:15.980 --> 43:21.360
Because here's the thing griffin as soon as they know any aspect of your life you've given them so much ammunition

43:21.900 --> 43:24.860
Where they see you and they're like, hey cat mom and you're like god damn it

43:25.660 --> 43:26.700
got me

43:26.700 --> 43:28.700
to me, I feel like

43:28.940 --> 43:33.100
if they said that to me, I would think about the only times I eat trail mix or when i'm like

43:33.820 --> 43:37.020
Traveling and i'm really worn out and it's like you deserve a little treat

43:37.020 --> 43:43.020
It's been hard for you and it's like they see me this is like a little baby that needs his bottom powdered and it's just like

43:43.100 --> 43:44.060
a little

43:44.060 --> 43:46.620
Little wimp who needs oh no energy

43:47.580 --> 43:48.780
actually

43:48.780 --> 43:49.740
Hey

43:49.740 --> 43:55.020
Yeah, the only time I eat trail mix is when I am flying to one of our many

43:55.580 --> 43:57.020

44:15.340 --> 44:20.140
leaving crowds of people stupefied with my great jokes and so

44:21.100 --> 44:26.060
Trail mix is not the food of some crunchy waistoid

44:26.060 --> 44:32.780
Uh, that's someone who has so many other great comedy shows to do. Yeah, they only have time for a handful of food

44:32.860 --> 44:37.340
So it better have a little bit of everything in there if I was a crunchy if I was a crunchy waistoid

44:37.340 --> 44:39.740
I'd call it gourd because I am

44:40.540 --> 44:41.580
a

44:41.580 --> 44:47.340
Businessman. Yeah, essentially, uh who eats trail mix because it has the protein I crave

44:54.160 --> 44:58.320
Uh, this is a this is a power food for powerful people

44:58.400 --> 45:04.080
The only trails that griven's worried about is kim trails the ones being left behind the plane that he's flying in to get to his

45:04.080 --> 45:07.520
Next thing maybe that's what they're saying is you look like a government chill

45:08.800 --> 45:10.160
Maybe yeah

45:10.160 --> 45:15.360
Now see I think I was going a different way where the only time I eat trail mix is like I rip it open

45:15.440 --> 45:17.760
And I slam it back like it's some kind of power pills

45:18.160 --> 45:21.520
Uh from a video game that's filling up my energy bar

45:21.520 --> 45:27.120
And so maybe what they're saying is you look like you uh move you move too quickly from thing to thing

45:27.120 --> 45:31.920
You're not taking time for you. Maybe this is a they're worried about you. Hey, they're worried about you

45:31.920 --> 45:36.400
You look like you're eating trail mix. You need to settle down make a meal make yourself a

45:36.960 --> 45:40.240
A knife and fork meal you deserve it eat some knife and fork food

45:40.480 --> 45:45.680
You deserve it. Don't just rip open a plastic baggie and slam it like some kind of like on-the-go machine

45:45.760 --> 45:49.680
You're not a machine. You're a person you have needs and you know what worse, you know what?

45:49.680 --> 45:54.400
Just take the time get a plate separate the trail mix bags. Thank you in the different

45:55.200 --> 45:58.640
These are that's a meal. That's a meal because it's separate you just have well

45:58.640 --> 46:02.720
You're going to use a spoon on the peanuts definitely a fork on the raisins. That's where you're going to feel it

46:02.800 --> 46:09.680
What's that? Oh, you've you've melted the chocolate candies into some sort of fondue that you can dip some uh, that's great

46:09.680 --> 46:13.440
You're doing it. This is a sort of deconstruction of trail mix. I call it

46:13.440 --> 46:19.440
trail

46:19.920 --> 46:26.720
It's not mixed at all. It's just it's it's just trail sort of composite. Um, you're gonna love it

46:27.920 --> 46:34.480
Eat one thing and go in a clockwise order around the plate. This is my artist's intent. It's a hundred

46:36.880 --> 46:38.880
It is it took me a lot of time to separate

46:38.880 --> 46:43.760
All the things it's very labor intensive. We just we I have another question

46:44.640 --> 46:47.440
We just moved the country and I pass by a little farm every day

46:47.680 --> 46:50.640
That has a trailer at the edge of their property next to the highway

46:51.040 --> 46:55.200
That trailer is full of beautiful plump pumpkins of all different sizes pumpkins

46:56.160 --> 47:00.640
There's a no sign indicating if the pumpkins are free or not. Can I go take some?

47:01.680 --> 47:06.560
Or are they decoration that's from pumpkin perplexed in minnesota. This will be quick. Hey

47:06.560 --> 47:11.040
Hey, hey peter cottontail calm the fuck down

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Chill you need to chill the fuck out, dude

47:14.640 --> 47:16.640
I know you're new you're new to the country

47:17.120 --> 47:22.400
It doesn't work like that. There's no sign saying if they're free or not, you know what that's applicable to

47:23.120 --> 47:26.160
All things pretty much like all things

47:26.880 --> 47:31.520
My car doesn't have a sign that says this beautiful buick is is taken

47:31.520 --> 47:37.600
And do not like whether it would be the alternate sign do not steal. I think if you don't see an is free sign

47:38.080 --> 47:42.560
The assumption is the base case has to be do not steal. Yeah now

47:43.360 --> 47:45.360
but unless unless

47:46.960 --> 47:49.600
We've all had that thought where we've driven past

47:50.400 --> 47:52.160
a cornfield

47:52.160 --> 47:54.320
And seen these beauties

47:54.320 --> 48:02.080
Yeah, uh, these golden beauties just shimmering in the sun and thought like if I just grabbed one of those

48:03.120 --> 48:05.280
one beauty one beauty

48:06.400 --> 48:13.680
Then there's no way that I would get caught. There's no way they would notice. It's one corn. You want to steal from farmers?

48:15.200 --> 48:20.320
I think that the subsidies that my tax dollars provide allow me whoa. No, no listen

48:20.320 --> 48:23.840
You can steal from farmers as much as I fucking want to oh, okay

48:24.560 --> 48:29.040
You didn't let me finish the thought. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry griffin. That's that's true. Yeah

48:29.680 --> 48:32.720
And it's not stealing because i'm the only one that's doing it

48:33.040 --> 48:36.960
So nobody they're not gonna know it's not like i'm telling everyone to steal from farmers

48:37.440 --> 48:40.560
I'm saying I should be able to steal one thing from every farmer

48:41.280 --> 48:46.800
It it's statistically a victimless crime. Yeah, it's basically around the grand scheme of things in the grand scheme of things

48:46.800 --> 48:51.680
It's basically a rounding error now. I will now I will say aside from the humble water

48:52.560 --> 48:57.520
Aside from the farmers on board aside from the humble watermelon farmer

48:58.560 --> 49:03.840
There is not a worse produce. I could steal than a pumpkin because you talk about economies of scale

49:04.320 --> 49:08.000
You can grow way fewer pumpkins than you can grow beautiful corn beauties

49:08.320 --> 49:14.080
So that the bottom line will be more affected in the pumpkin in the pumpkin industry

49:14.080 --> 49:21.360
Then that's why I feel fine stealing one soybean. That's something I feel comfortable doing right smaller than corn even less noticeable

49:21.520 --> 49:24.320
I'm fine with us as long as we're talking about cornfields

49:24.320 --> 49:29.680
Can I make a call to hollywood stop making it look so fun when cars go like barreling through cornfields?

49:29.680 --> 49:32.160
And I know it's supposed to be like a scary or whatever the funnest thing

49:32.240 --> 49:38.400
But like every time I pass a cornfield, there's this party that's like what if I just hooked left because there's no way

49:38.800 --> 49:43.120
You would get your car would get halfway into the cornfield before it would come to a dead stop

49:43.120 --> 49:46.640
Oh, yeah, just from pure pure corn friction

49:47.200 --> 49:52.880
Which is like it would get wrapped up in your undercarriage all kinds of corns up in the works shouldn't be in there

49:53.840 --> 49:55.840
No, but it looks like fun because it's like

49:58.640 --> 50:00.640
You cannot

50:01.440 --> 50:03.760
You don't need us to hey. Hey friend

50:04.640 --> 50:10.160
You don't need us to tell you that you can't just take some pumpkin off a corn field or a pumpkin field

50:10.160 --> 50:14.320
You know that right? They don't want you if they wanted you to there'd be a sign

50:14.560 --> 50:19.440
This is another example of a sign would help if there was a sign there that said hey free pumpkin

50:19.680 --> 50:23.600
Yeah, you should take it. Otherwise, it's just they're a decoration, right?

50:23.680 --> 50:27.600
I've got some pumpkins in front of my house now that I put out there because it's the fall

50:27.920 --> 50:31.840
And the idea of someone like well if they're just sitting there and I see them every day when I drive by so they want

50:31.920 --> 50:33.920
Me to take one, right? No

50:33.920 --> 50:40.320
There's more pumpkins. I would say it's like the that you are actually stumbling into the base tenant of

50:41.100 --> 50:47.680
Society which is if I set this here. I don't need to put a sign on it. It says don't steal it, right? I'll just

50:48.480 --> 50:50.480
People won't steal it. It's like a base

50:51.120 --> 50:52.400
Ten. Yeah

50:52.400 --> 50:58.240
I have to announce it's free because that is not it's a natural that's not the natural state

50:58.240 --> 51:04.800
default also if you try this to take a pumpkin you then burn it at peter's might come out and make your

51:05.120 --> 51:09.520
Make your balls shrivel up. Yeah with her magic with her magic with her magic

51:11.120 --> 51:13.120
Yeah

51:16.320 --> 51:18.320
I want a munch

51:20.720 --> 51:22.720
I want to munch

51:22.720 --> 51:24.720
Squat

51:45.360 --> 51:48.080

51:48.080 --> 51:53.760
Is still in the fucking mix not in Huntington the Huntington one closed?

51:53.760 --> 51:56.000
But somewhere they're out there doing their sandwich business

51:57.280 --> 52:02.640
Sandwich place can't stay afloat in Huntington like get out of the full game to be fair

52:02.640 --> 52:07.120
We also lost the quiz nose. We lost the credit to highfalutin people couldn't wait for the toast thing

Or is it like oh 20 years ago. Look guys. It's bare naked pizza. No

53:32.480 --> 53:35.920
I'm mad at Shlotsky's and for some reason I'm mad at bare naked ladies

53:35.920 --> 53:41.600
And I know they had nothing to do with this. They were always going to get dragged into this though travis. That's a great point

53:41.760 --> 53:44.400
Um, no, it's the bare naked pizza

53:44.560 --> 53:52.160
You know how sometimes when you pick up a tomato and you say oh naked sauce. It's like it's just like that. It's one step before

53:53.120 --> 53:56.320
The thing so the uh, shlotsky's is undressing its pizza

53:56.320 --> 54:05.760

54:06.080 --> 54:08.080
499

54:08.560 --> 54:15.520
How much is a regular pizza that's good and has stuff on reminder schlotsky's deals in like personal pan like there this is not a

54:16.480 --> 54:19.840
like full-size party pizza oops all crusts

54:19.840 --> 54:25.700
This experience schlotsky's is undressing its pizza one topping at a time and slow

54:26.180 --> 54:30.740
That's not the way you would make this. There's no way travis. Let schlotsky's give us a boner

54:30.980 --> 54:35.060
Okay, schlotsky's is undressing its pizza one topping at a time

54:35.620 --> 54:37.460
at a slow

54:37.460 --> 54:39.140
salivating seduction

54:39.140 --> 54:43.380
resulting in limited time only bare naked pizza

54:43.380 --> 54:49.380
Uh, the beloved fast casual restaurant that sentence didn't communicate more information

54:49.380 --> 54:51.060
It just wanted to be sexy for a second

54:51.060 --> 54:51.300
Yep

54:51.300 --> 54:54.420
Because it's schlotsky's and it wants to find it sexy and live there

54:54.820 --> 55:01.220
The beyond and I want to empower them. I want to empower them to do like I know that schlott corporations aren't people

55:01.700 --> 55:06.580
But someone at schlotsky's is trying to figure some shit out about themselves and they're using

55:07.140 --> 55:12.580
The work that they do is the vehicle for that discovery. I think that's beautiful and pure

55:12.580 --> 55:16.200
Um, but I don't want to I but I don't want to pay 4.99

55:17.060 --> 55:19.060
for a crust round of

55:19.780 --> 55:21.700
no cheese crust round, uh

55:21.700 --> 55:26.580
That is going to not scratch the pizza itch because it's a p it's actually a pita

55:27.140 --> 55:30.420
Yeah instead is what we're talking about. I would also be willing to bet

55:31.300 --> 55:32.580
that this

55:32.580 --> 55:36.020
Uh naked pizza comes with sauce to dip it in

55:37.300 --> 55:39.940
There's no way that they hand you this without

55:39.940 --> 55:47.460
Something to dip it in the beloved fast casual restaurant famous for its made in house oven baked sourdough bread is giving customers

55:47.460 --> 55:54.900
Another way to indulge by featuring mouth-watering videos celebrating its unique one-of-a-kind sourdough pizza crust on the new

55:55.540 --> 56:01.060
Bare naked pizza only fans page get the fuck out. Yeah, baby

56:01.140 --> 56:03.620
I don't need to get the fuck out travis because i'm not

56:04.020 --> 56:06.020
Lying to you

56:06.020 --> 56:10.020
Hold on

56:10.660 --> 56:14.100
Here it is, oh I hate it the bare naked pizza

56:14.740 --> 56:17.300
Uh only it does have a page on only fans

56:18.020 --> 56:24.340
So you can subscribe to that and see its dick so many people were involved in that being on there

56:24.820 --> 56:28.180
Do you know how many fucking meetings? Yes, travis exactly

56:28.420 --> 56:33.380
How many means are like there's had to be like three or four people who are like we can't

56:33.380 --> 56:40.520
We can't we don't come back from an only fans page. We're schlotzkis. We're not experimenting. We're schlotzkis

56:41.220 --> 56:43.220
We're not trying to make ends meet

56:43.220 --> 56:45.220
Maybe they are schlotzkis

56:45.220 --> 56:50.980
I'm upset at schlotzkis. We're using our expertise in fresh fresh baked sourdough to create

56:51.120 --> 56:55.540
Irresistible pizza dough that we think is the best in the biz and also some

56:55.860 --> 57:00.180
Very specific pornography. That's according to schlotzkis executive chef

57:00.180 --> 57:03.380
Jennifer keel who probably didn't have a hand in the only fans thing

57:03.860 --> 57:07.540
We're so confident in our delicious doughs that we're willing to serve them in their bare naked

57:07.940 --> 57:13.220
So pizza lovers can taste our perfectly crispy yet light and airy crusts in all their glory

57:15.300 --> 57:19.380
So it's just the thing is about this is that they're selling you bread

57:20.180 --> 57:21.300
You know

57:21.300 --> 57:25.140
Yeah, you know, it's bread. They're calling it a different thing, but it's

57:25.140 --> 57:32.500
It's it's definitely bread. It's definitely bread and the reason I know that is that they're not

57:33.620 --> 57:35.620
selling sauce cup

57:35.940 --> 57:40.420
Which is a cup of pizza sauce and they say we're so confident

57:41.380 --> 57:43.540
about our pizza sauces tangy

57:44.160 --> 57:46.160
flavors that we have

57:46.980 --> 57:49.540
Created it's a pornography website

57:50.640 --> 57:52.640
exclusively for the for this

57:52.640 --> 57:54.640
red wet sauce

57:55.200 --> 57:56.400
um

57:56.400 --> 58:00.560
And we don't think we even need the bread anymore. That was stupid. That was a stupid joke

58:03.200 --> 58:05.600
The sauce is what's up now sexy

58:06.560 --> 58:13.440
We're so confident. You'll love you'll love our pepperonis that we open up our only fans page and this one is actually

58:14.240 --> 58:21.040
Really popular actually, it's just this these huge long tubes of pepperoni and we're cutting them in half with knives and people love it

58:21.040 --> 58:23.040
Which people like that? I don't know. I

58:23.440 --> 58:28.320
I'm excited for like two weeks from now when schloss is like releasing a press release list like hey

58:28.640 --> 58:31.520
Uh, we have to stop that only fans page

58:32.160 --> 58:37.280
Because way more people subscribe to it than we are comfortable with it's getting to be a tax issue

58:38.000 --> 58:40.080
normally, we love the money but

58:40.720 --> 58:45.920
What about when you go to schlossies after this promotion and you're like i'll have a regular pizza and they're like, oh fuck

58:45.920 --> 58:52.480
I sold damn. Couldn't you have it on a paper towel? Because we actually did sell on the crust

58:53.760 --> 58:55.680
Can you eat it on a paper towel? That's our thing

58:55.680 --> 59:01.280
This month is we didn't actually figure out the supply chain issues. So, um, that has to be what this is

59:01.440 --> 59:04.160
Yeah, a hundred hundred percent like they got too much

59:05.200 --> 59:08.480
Wait pepperoni costs how much now fuck? Um

59:10.160 --> 59:14.240
