00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:44.400
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.200
Hello, everybody. Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me on the advice show for the

00:47.200 --> 00:50.560
Modron era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.560 --> 00:56.480
I am your middlest brother, and I have been and will always be Travis McElroy.

00:56.480 --> 01:02.080
I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:02.080 --> 01:11.280
And folks, we beefed it, didn't we? I will be the first to admit that we beefed it.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.520
And you mean regarding Laughter and Love? Regarding Laughter and Love, thank you, Travis.

01:15.520 --> 01:24.080
Yes, we've gotten some criticism, I think, over our selection of the motto of the tagline,

01:24.080 --> 01:30.000
whatever you want to call it. And I have actually gathered everybody here today for this press

01:30.000 --> 01:44.080
conference to announce my, I can't, I fucking can't believe I'm saying this, my support for

01:44.080 --> 01:48.880
20 Honey Down to Beastness. And this has never happened before in this year, and this is the

01:48.880 --> 01:54.160
run of the show, that we have endorsed a switcheroonie in the middle of the year. Folks,

01:54.160 --> 02:00.400
it's fucking June. We're like halfway through this shit. And I'm suggesting a switcheroonie.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.520
I'm leaning hard into a switcheroonie. Here's the thing about Laughter and Love. It's a good

02:03.520 --> 02:08.720
principle. You should fill it. Fill it right up. Love, especially. Get that in there. It's so

02:08.720 --> 02:14.080
important. Beatles, yes, all about it. But it's a little self-serving, isn't it?

02:14.080 --> 02:20.080
Yep. There's something about Down to Beastness that's like a trumpet declaring like,

02:20.080 --> 02:26.480
let's fucking roll. First, I have two complicating factors. Okay, yes, please. The first is that

02:28.800 --> 02:32.320
I hate to rename the tour this late into the year. Well, good news.

02:34.960 --> 02:40.800
Yeah, I mean, we've got all the tickets printed, got all the fucking shirts with all the stops on

02:40.800 --> 02:46.400
it. Yeah, man. We hired all the Skyriders. And we have the one-act play about Laughter and Love

02:46.400 --> 02:52.000
that we wrote to perform at all of our tour stops. I just hate to rename it at this point.

02:53.600 --> 03:01.200
For sure. That's huge. Number two is, do you remember when all the businesses

03:02.160 --> 03:07.040
had to shut down and a lot of them are still shut down? That's totally for me bumping.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.680
Well, then you can- Go ahead, Trapp.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.000
If I may, as the- You won't.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.920
Okay. The businesses, right? No, no, I'm sorry. I will draw a line in the sand here. Those are

03:17.920 --> 03:19.680
businesses, Justin. Yeah, that's a different thing.

03:19.680 --> 03:25.040
Those are businesses. Businesses are over there. They're making money or not making money,

03:25.040 --> 03:27.680
whatever the case may be. And we love that or we don't.

03:27.680 --> 03:32.320
Or we don't or whatever. I'm talking about Beezness. And Beezness has to do with both

03:32.320 --> 03:40.800
the individual and the hive. So right now, we are all individuals doing our own Beezness,

03:40.800 --> 03:45.840
but also working towards a greater goal as the hive.

03:45.840 --> 03:50.080
A bigger Beezness. A bigger Beezness. A bigger, better Beezness.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.760
And that's important. I think it's also just about, you know how Beez, they go around,

03:55.760 --> 03:59.120
they pick up the pollen and they get it all over themselves and that makes them horny or

03:59.120 --> 04:02.640
something like that. And then they take it back to the hive and they vibrate so violently and

04:02.640 --> 04:08.240
it makes all the pollen go off and then the queen eats it to make honey out of her butt.

04:09.440 --> 04:14.240
I think that down to Beezness recommends like a sort of like shedding, like a vibrating and

04:14.240 --> 04:17.280
getting off complacency. Yeah.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.440
This is fair. This is fair. You know what Beez don't do? They don't rest on their laurels.

04:23.440 --> 04:29.360
They can't. They can't. They're too little. You've complicated this because Beez,

04:29.360 --> 04:34.640
I think at some point it would be beneficial for them to rest on laurels just so the various

04:34.640 --> 04:40.960
pollination things that need to happen. Do you know what I mean? Like resting on laurels

04:40.960 --> 04:45.040
occasionally for them is probably essential. So they probably do rest on laurels.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.960
Let me put it another way then about the Beez. Here's the thing. The Beez,

04:48.960 --> 04:54.800
they're minding their own, if I may, Beezness, right? And if you fuck with them,

04:55.440 --> 04:58.080
you're going to get that sting. You're going to get stung.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.760
That's absolutely wild, Travis. The thing you said to me that they're minding their own business

05:01.760 --> 05:06.640
is absolutely wild. These monstrous things are flying around fucking plants and stinging toddlers

05:06.640 --> 05:11.920
every single day. It is what they are known for. They're making movies about it. They crave it.

05:11.920 --> 05:17.520
They crave interaction with us. They love interfacing with humans so much they made

05:17.520 --> 05:20.480
their jizz taste good. Come on now. It's a trap.

05:22.160 --> 05:27.760
It is, to Justin's point, a literal honeypot. Thank you. Well, perhaps then there was a time,

05:27.760 --> 05:32.240
do you think there was a time where Beez were like, listen, if we poke people with our butts,

05:32.240 --> 05:37.440
we die. We all know that. That is scientific fact. And so we have been reluctant to sting

05:37.440 --> 05:44.480
people with our butts. But the time has come. We need to start stinging people with our butts.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.560
And listen, we were going to leave them alone if they left us alone, but they did not leave us

05:48.560 --> 05:54.800
alone. And we don't want to sting people with our butts. We don't want to. Okay. You did not address

05:54.800 --> 06:00.240
any of my salient points. And this is classic, classic oratory style from you, Travis, to think

06:00.240 --> 06:05.840
that you can get away with this because you have not addressed my chief complaints. They're totally

06:05.840 --> 06:16.720
in our business now. Okay. But I'm saying you're the one who said we take their butt jizz and we

06:16.720 --> 06:23.120
eat it on our toast. We're so far from it, aren't we? What if somebody did that? What if I was making

06:23.120 --> 06:28.800
a sandwich and a giant said, okay, great. And peeled up my roof and scraped that sandwich out

06:28.800 --> 06:35.120
of my house to eat it on his bigger sandwich. And this is a sandwich that you have made from

06:35.120 --> 06:41.600
your own jizz. Well, listen, we don't need to carry it that far. You nasty, nasty boy. I don't

06:41.600 --> 06:46.720
understand why we need to go that far with the metaphor. I'm just saying I work hard to make

06:46.720 --> 06:52.160
a sandwich. You have to work hard if you're going to make a jizz sandwich. Listen, we don't have to

06:52.160 --> 06:57.280
carry the metaphor that far. The metaphor has poisoned this episode so far. This is all I'm

06:57.280 --> 07:07.200
saying. The shit is changing right now. Shit is revolutionary. And it's important to get in there.

07:07.200 --> 07:12.560
It's important to march, support Black Lives Matter, do whatever you can. And I don't want to

07:12.560 --> 07:18.960
be out here with, I'm sorry, my dick in my hand screaming, but also fill your life with laughter

07:18.960 --> 07:25.280
and love. There's just no way. There's just no way. Fight against police brutality, defund the police,

07:25.280 --> 07:30.400
and also while you're at it, here's a cross dish that says fill your life with laughter and love.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.480
No fucking thank you. Doesn't feel right. I just want to, I don't understand the way this works,

07:34.480 --> 07:42.480
where if we have settled on a theme for the year. Yeah. And we, and two of you say let's change it.

07:42.480 --> 07:48.960
Is that just it? Is it a majority vote or is this like? Fuck man, I mean. Because it does raise the

07:48.960 --> 07:54.800
question, if we have the ability to do this, it does raise the question of 2016. We had a cherry

07:54.800 --> 07:59.120
seven weeks there at the tail end where we could have been like, listen, these bridges ain't getting

07:59.120 --> 08:06.000
built. No 2016. We're changing it to 2016. Yeah. Well, I think it is important to note we haven't

08:06.000 --> 08:11.920
finished the second quarter of the year yet, right? So I think we're still, like if you're,

08:11.920 --> 08:18.960
just mathematically, there are still more year left than isn't. So I think we can change it.

08:18.960 --> 08:24.400
I think that after we pass the end of June, we would have missed the window. Yeah. And it's

08:24.400 --> 08:30.080
going to be too tough for us to come up with a third, even more appropriate slogan. Like I think

08:30.080 --> 08:34.720
all three of us can get on the same page there. That's fucking unthinkable. The emotional toll

08:34.720 --> 08:39.680
that goes into slogan generation is like not repeatable. We almost didn't survive the first

08:39.680 --> 08:46.800
time. And maybe, maybe man, God willing, we'll get to a point where maybe we can get back to

08:46.800 --> 08:52.160
focusing on laughter and love, right? Maybe that will be a fourth quarter slogan. 2021. Let's try

08:52.160 --> 09:02.640
again. 2021-y funny. I will grant you this. The speed at which things seem to be moving

09:02.640 --> 09:10.480
currently does make the idea that we could sort of encapsulate 12 months of existence on this

09:10.480 --> 09:21.600
particular plane unthinkable. The height of hubris, honestly. Yeah. I was going to suggest monthly,

09:21.600 --> 09:33.440
but even weekly, let's just say this week. Do you know how wild it is that there have been

09:33.440 --> 09:37.920
several times in the past week to 10 days where I've been talking to someone and been like,

09:38.640 --> 09:44.960
oh, right, there's a global pandemic that's shutting shit. Like that I have to remember

09:44.960 --> 09:53.760
about how the planet is sick. Yeah. Wild, wild times. Are we doing this? I mean, are we doing

09:53.760 --> 09:59.440
this? I'm into it if you guys are, but like, I want to make sure that this is, you can't walk

09:59.440 --> 10:05.280
it back because of what I don't want is like, I've always felt pretty good about punks a tiny

10:05.280 --> 10:11.440
Phil style. We make the call. That's the call. Right. And no one else gets to weigh in on it.

10:11.440 --> 10:18.560
I don't want people to think that this is a sort of, you know, submit ticket and we'll review it to

10:18.560 --> 10:24.240
see if we change the year. No, I think that this is perhaps the most special of circumstances

10:24.960 --> 10:29.520
one could possibly imagine. Special is a fucking word for it. Yeah. We're not going to make a habit

10:29.520 --> 10:37.840
out of this, but we shit our pants. Yeah. We shit our pants. And I don't want to sit in these shitty

10:37.840 --> 10:47.600
pants for 12 months. There's no way. We are now so consistent at getting it wrong. Yeah. That I'm

10:47.600 --> 10:51.680
starting to think next year we should title it, watch your house burn down as your infant daughter

10:51.680 --> 10:57.920
cries. And that way that won't happen to anybody. Like that will guaranteed not happen. Yeah.

10:57.920 --> 11:04.560
Right. I think if we did, we could even make it like 2021. I'm not going to win a brand new

11:04.560 --> 11:10.880
Kia Sorento over a radio contest. And then I, and then it will happen and I will have one,

11:10.880 --> 11:16.640
but I think it is 2020, 20 honey down to business. So yes. Okay. Well, I'm,

11:18.400 --> 11:27.520
I think it's official. Let's call it 2020. Okay. I do have a question. We'll call the press.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.560
You were going to say president. No, let's do that. Let's dial him up.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.960
Um, I, I do want, can we, you can actually call the white house.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.400
You can? I think you could just call the white house.

11:39.280 --> 11:44.480
Well, let's do, I have a few complaints. I'd love to register. Um, I thought it's been pretty

11:44.480 --> 11:50.320
smooth sailing. I disagree. It's been quite bad. Okay. You can write a letter to the president

11:50.320 --> 11:56.160
that takes forever. No, thanks. No sending gifts. Why would I do that? I don't even like the fella.

11:56.160 --> 12:04.800
Oh, come on. Uh, okay. Comments. The, okay. I have the number to call the white house with comments.

12:04.800 --> 12:10.160
Oh boy. I guess the white house. Can you dial them in on Skype and we'll just let them know

12:10.160 --> 12:15.680
we're changing the year. Um, I'll just, I'll just do, uh, speakerphone. Will that work?

12:15.680 --> 12:20.800
Yes. That's good. Will you hear all of us or? Well, Justin, you could speak for, as the eldest,

12:20.800 --> 12:24.320
I'll let you speak for us. I'll speak for you guys. Yeah. You can hear, you'll be able to hear

12:24.320 --> 12:30.000
them and we can do it like a, like a funny Ellen show thing where like we tell you what you have

12:30.000 --> 12:36.400
to say. No, I don't think I'll probably do that. That'd be really cool. Okay. Uh, everybody shut

12:36.400 --> 12:41.680
up. Call the president right now. Okay. Tell him to eat shit. Also say that if it comes up.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.400
Thank you for calling the white house comment line. The office is temporarily closed.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.720

13:22.560 --> 13:26.880
for the Trump administration when they realized they could just close the comment office? Oh wait,

13:26.880 --> 13:33.440
we don't want to listen to what anybody says. Nobody seems to dig it. We could just close it.

13:33.440 --> 13:41.040
Oh yeah. Do that. Hey, should I just tweet at him? No, no, that's not it. Listen, I'm on the

13:41.040 --> 13:46.000
website address that they did tell us to go to on the phone. So I'm just going to let them know.

13:46.000 --> 13:57.280
Hey, we're changing the slogan to the business one. Also suck the farts right out of the bottom

13:57.280 --> 14:09.040
of my shorts. You fucking dipshit. And I'm going to send that right now. Okay. Oh, it needs a valid

14:09.040 --> 14:15.760
phone number. Uh, juice, can I put yours? Oh, do we start the Google number? Do we start the,

14:15.760 --> 14:20.000
my brother, it's fine. I submit it. I just typed in eight a bunch of times. So if that is your phone

14:20.000 --> 14:26.400
number, I apologize. So should we do the show now? This is the show. Look around you. This is show.

14:26.400 --> 14:31.280
It's strange to be doing this show in the midst of these, of these challenging times,

14:31.280 --> 14:37.680
but we hope you all are, uh, are doing well and keeping safe and staying involved and getting it

14:37.680 --> 14:44.160
down to fucking business. Doesn't that feel right? Okay. But here's one question. Is it retroactive

14:44.160 --> 14:49.200
or was this year themed failure, fling after in love, and then changed on June? We have to

14:49.200 --> 14:52.320
acknowledge the change. Like there's no way we can sweep that. We're not trying to gas.

14:52.320 --> 14:56.320
Unless we're going to go back and edit a bunch of podcasts, which we're too lazy to do.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.920
Yeah. There's no way. Okay. Now we have started, let me just say for future,

14:59.920 --> 15:04.720
we have started doing dynamic ads on the adventure zone. What if we started doing dynamic

15:04.720 --> 15:10.720
year themes? That could be fun. That's smart. Very smart. Sadly, I had to move out of my apartment

15:10.720 --> 15:15.040
last month. While moving out, I was carrying a blender to my car when I passed my landlord who

15:15.040 --> 15:21.520
said, wow, you really liked that blender, huh? I was confused and just replied, yep. Now a month

15:21.520 --> 15:27.440
later, it's only just occurred to me, this is not my blender and is actually my landlord said he

15:27.440 --> 15:33.360
lent to us. Should I give it back? It's been so long and I actually do really like this blender.

15:33.360 --> 15:40.960
That's from Blender Burglar in BC. Hachi Machi. Hachi. That's it is, wow. Wow. That's rough.

15:40.960 --> 15:47.200
Many thoughts. Oh, good. Let's enumerate them for us middle brother. First broad thought,

15:47.200 --> 15:53.040
just to address one thing right there in the middle. It's been so long. I do not know if you

15:53.040 --> 15:57.360
take something from someone that there's a length of time. I think we might have discussed this

15:57.360 --> 16:02.560
before. There's not a length of time that you own it before it is not stolen anymore.

16:02.560 --> 16:10.480
No, it's always stolen, yes. It's always stolen. That said, there does seem to be an implied,

16:11.600 --> 16:18.800
like the landlord said, you must really like that blender and not, hey, give me my fucking blender

16:18.800 --> 16:27.760
back. Well, I mean, I feel like, wow, you really like that blender, huh? Got the job done for 99%

16:27.760 --> 16:32.880
of people who heard it. Most people who hear that would have the fucking neuron fire in their brain

16:32.880 --> 16:38.160
that would go like, oh fuck, I stole this. This is a very special edge case where they're like,

16:38.160 --> 16:44.560
wow, what a great blender compliment, which does not exist. Can you imagine what went through that

16:44.560 --> 16:51.920
landlord's head when you just replied, yep. What's your relationship with your landlord like where

16:51.920 --> 16:56.400
you're like, damn, we got a lot of frozen strawberries and some yogurt and some almond

16:56.400 --> 17:02.160
milk. Let's make some fucking strawberry smoothies up in this shit. Uh oh, we don't have a blender.

17:02.160 --> 17:08.960
It's cool. I know a guy. It's my landlord. I'll just go hit them up for a blender really quick.

17:10.080 --> 17:15.840
What? It is, yeah, okay. I want to go back. I need to flash back to the inception of this.

17:15.840 --> 17:22.320
Did you think that you would go to your landlord and say, do you have a spare blender? And anyone

17:22.320 --> 17:28.000
would say, yes, I do have a spare blender. That's wild already. How did that even come up in

17:28.000 --> 17:34.480
conversation? Because everybody's got the one blender that they use. Did it come with the

17:34.480 --> 17:38.560
apartment? Because if so, there are many things that come with the apartment that you can't take

17:38.560 --> 17:43.760
with you. So your insane landlord was like, hey, look, better yet, this place is furnished and it's

17:43.760 --> 17:49.440
just one blender on the counter. It is possible that maybe the landlord just got married and so

17:49.440 --> 17:55.040
they do have a lot of blenders. Oh. Or it could just be that they- Fucking inverse though,

17:55.040 --> 18:00.160
inverse though. Your landlord comes down, knocks on your door. Hey, random shot in the dark,

18:00.160 --> 18:05.920
y'all don't need a blender, do you? Because I got a spare. And I'm just going door to door asking

18:05.920 --> 18:12.480
if anyone needs a blender. You say that, my man, but I've had a lot of landlords and at least two

18:12.480 --> 18:19.200
of them would have done that. Yeah. I had a landlord that would come by often and just knock

18:19.200 --> 18:23.120
and be like, do you guys need anything? Because they managed a bunch of properties and people

18:23.120 --> 18:27.840
would leave stuff places. And then they'd be like, somebody left a microwave, do you guys,

18:27.840 --> 18:33.600
what's your microwave situation like? And it's like, I don't know. They were weirdly involved

18:33.600 --> 18:38.560
in our whole deal. They came and were like, do you want me to plant tomatoes for you?

18:38.560 --> 18:42.400
And I was like, no, they'll die. I'm not going to care for those things.

18:42.400 --> 18:47.280
If anyone, if this person needed a blender, if they were kind of a blender person,

18:47.280 --> 18:53.440
and everybody knows, they would, they have to have replaced it by this point. And at that,

18:53.440 --> 18:56.320
then what you're doing, if you try to return it, what you're doing is like,

18:56.320 --> 19:01.440
you have two blenders now. This is your problem. It's a victimless crime. Now, let me say real

19:01.440 --> 19:04.240
quick, the person- That it's not a victimless crime.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.760
The person, well, the person- No, by definition, we know,

19:07.760 --> 19:11.600
Griffin, we in fact know who the victim is that is described in the question.

19:11.600 --> 19:16.160
Let me just say this though. Let me get this out there. Knowing landlords,

19:16.160 --> 19:19.600
and every landlord I've ever had, and every landlord that exists on the planet, I bet if

19:19.600 --> 19:27.360
you close your eyes and think real hard, you could think of some way, some thing they have done that

19:27.360 --> 19:33.520
you can now frame this act as one of justice and frame yourself like the Scarlet Pimpernel

19:33.520 --> 19:37.360
liberating blenders from crooked landlords all across this great nation of ours.

19:37.360 --> 19:46.320
Mm. Whether it's a disagreement about security deposit or they yelled at you because you're

19:46.320 --> 19:52.160
playing rock band too loud, whatever the fuck it is, I think you probably could come up with

19:52.160 --> 19:58.640
some justification for this. Yes? Now, I do have a solution. If you are just

19:58.640 --> 20:03.920
ed up with guilt and you need to return this blender, but you don't want to do it face to

20:03.920 --> 20:11.280
face or anything that acknowledges that you mindfully took this blender, I'm going to give

20:11.280 --> 20:21.440
you three words. Brave little toaster. You need to do a job to make it seem like the blender has

20:21.440 --> 20:28.320
escaped your house and made it back to the landlord's house, the landlord that they love so

20:28.320 --> 20:36.000
much that maybe it's a blender and like a little radio and maybe an electric blanket and a desk

20:36.000 --> 20:42.960
lamp and they have all made it back to see the landlord master, which by the way, in that show,

20:42.960 --> 20:46.400
they called the guy master. It's very weird. It's not great.

20:47.040 --> 20:55.680
But now the brave little blender has returned and hey, so there's a second brave little toaster

20:55.680 --> 21:01.680
movie. Is this going somewhere? It is. But there's another sequel to brave little toaster where the

21:01.680 --> 21:08.400
brave little toaster and friends are able to communicate with animals. And now this crosses

21:08.400 --> 21:15.040
into a lot of questionable kind of science where I can accept that the toaster and the radio and

21:15.040 --> 21:19.360
the lamp and the vacuum and the electric blanket can all talk to each other, but now they can also

21:19.360 --> 21:27.040
talk to monkeys and dogs and cats and like mice and rats. This fucking unhinged screed that you

21:27.040 --> 21:32.880
have deviated. It was like you just did a magic trick to me, Travis, because I don't know where

21:32.880 --> 21:37.120
it fucking flipped. It's hard enough to wrap my mind around the fact that cats and dogs and rats

21:37.120 --> 21:44.000
and stuff can communicate. Don't get me wrong. Your protests against this movie franchise are

21:44.000 --> 21:48.480
well understood. And there's a lot of meat there for us to dig our teeth into. They went to fucking

21:48.480 --> 21:52.960
Mars at one point. They flew there on a ceiling fan. Get fucking real, brave little toaster. We're

21:52.960 --> 21:58.400
out here trying to do stuff. But also, Travis, ostensibly, this is an advice show. And we were

21:58.400 --> 22:02.480
talking about a thing and you turned it into a- Yeah, but we finished that. And I want to talk

22:02.480 --> 22:08.720
about brave little toaster. Okay, interesting. How does a brave little toaster talk to a dog?

22:09.600 --> 22:14.480
Please. With fucking magic. Why is it alive? It shouldn't be alive. All toasters are dead.

22:14.480 --> 22:19.520
If the master sees the brave little toaster move, does the brave little toaster die?

22:19.520 --> 22:22.400
All toasters, ceiling fans, electric blankets are dead. Next question.

22:22.400 --> 22:27.920
I have an additional question. If the brave little toaster dies, is it then just a toaster?

22:27.920 --> 22:32.880
Good question. Well, you would think that if it dies, it ceases to make toast, right?

22:33.680 --> 22:38.320
Okay. Because if my body dies, I don't keep making things with my body, right?

22:38.320 --> 22:44.720
Well, then again, some people do evacuate their bowels after death, so maybe.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.920
Let's stop it. Stop it.

22:45.920 --> 22:49.440
If he dies, you get one last good toast out of his face.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.960
Okay. If he dies from toast, he goes and finishes up.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.120
He does get one more toast. From radiant heat.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.560
Let's put a button on it. Here's what to do to get out of this situation.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.840
Nothing. Fucking chill on the smooth tip. You're good. Free toaster. Enjoy.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.760
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Graham Roebuck. It was a blender. The toaster was the whole-

23:05.760 --> 23:08.640
Fuck. You fucking ruined me, Travis.

23:08.640 --> 23:16.320
It's from anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I am going to call the brave little toaster,

23:16.320 --> 23:18.960
who asks how to make iPod.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.160
I've been getting into crafts, and I think we're all into crafts these days,

23:25.360 --> 23:31.200
just sort of to keep ourselves busy during this quarantine.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.960
I've been doing hard candy, juice. I know you built a wood bench,

23:34.960 --> 23:36.880
which is so fucking off brand.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.320
My brand has gotten pretty fucked up lately.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.000
I think all of our brands are fucked up. I did sourdough.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.560
Travis is doing sourdough. The brands are toast.

23:45.520 --> 23:49.520
I was eyeing different kinds of jigsaw blades last night.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.160
Fantasizing about owning a lighter array.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.120
You got a Sawzall? Sawzall will make you feel powerful.

23:55.120 --> 23:59.120
Okay, we can't. We can't. We fucking can't.

23:59.120 --> 24:03.600
But how do you make an iPod? Because that would be pretty cool if you could just do that.

24:03.600 --> 24:07.120
Like people are going to Apple stores, I guess, and spending a bunch of money on things.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.720
And it would be cool, like a nice cost-saving measure,

24:12.720 --> 24:14.880
if you could just make an iPod at home.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.920
So I'm wondering if we could have, we're all pretty crafty.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.360
I don't know how making hard candy is going to be helpful.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.960
Well, you can make a candy iPod.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.880
I guess you could, huh?

24:25.440 --> 24:25.840
Yeah.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.720
Justin, are you Googling how to make a-

24:26.720 --> 24:28.800
Not a functional one. I mean, by the definition.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.400
Well, what's functional? You know, like place music. Oh.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.120
That's a good, actually, that's a great metric for iPod.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.000
That's a great metric. When I'm judging iPod,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.720
I like to look at it and see if it can play some of my favorite tunes.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.360
That's fair. Okay, that is a good point.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.560
Now what about like an iPod Touch? iPod Touch will do a bunch of different things,

24:48.560 --> 24:50.080
not just music at that point.

24:50.880 --> 24:56.160
What if you got an iPhone and then removed the SIM card?

24:56.160 --> 24:57.200
Now you've got an iPod.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.480
That's one way of going about it. I will give you that one, Travis.

25:00.480 --> 25:04.080
It would have to be a pretty old iPhone.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.080
Nope, you can still connect it to Wi-Fi. That's nothing.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.760
I want to make a fucking iPod, Travis.

25:07.760 --> 25:08.560
Okay.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.320
I want to make an iPod that I can listen to-

25:10.320 --> 25:12.880
I want to listen to Twenty One Pilots, my very favorite band on it.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.240
So it's got to be an iPod.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.480
Here's the loophole. I've just figured out the loophole.

25:16.480 --> 25:16.800
Okay.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.320
Does it have to be iPod-sized?

25:21.760 --> 25:24.080
Where the fuck are you going with this?

25:24.080 --> 25:26.800
Well, if I could build like a big box,

25:27.520 --> 25:30.000
you could probably go around your house and find like a Walkman

25:30.000 --> 25:34.160
that you've got and like an old camera and a bunch of stuff.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.880
And if I can make it like two foot by four foot,

25:37.760 --> 25:41.120
I could probably like attach all those things in there.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.880
This is Travis's iPod.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.160
This is my iPod.

25:44.160 --> 25:48.160
A lot of people are talking about form factor, the smooth bevel.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.080
Fuck that. This is Travis's iPod.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.080
It's got all kinds of technology in there.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.800
It weighs 130 pounds.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.000
Is it made of cardboard? Yes.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.840
Is there a button on it that I drew on it with marker

25:57.840 --> 25:59.440
that when you press it, you reach your hand inside

25:59.440 --> 26:01.280
and you grab some fruit snacks I hid in there?

26:01.280 --> 26:03.360
Also, yes, but your phone can't fucking do that.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.040
This is Travis's iPod.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.240
I call that Fruit Ninja.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.560
This is a fun bit.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.560
Justin, you've been furiously Googling something.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.480
I would love to know what it was.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.760
I'm not Googling anything.

26:16.640 --> 26:21.920
If we could have made an iPod out of the primitive materials

26:21.920 --> 26:27.120
and tools and crafts that we as a species have possessed

26:27.120 --> 26:30.480
for millennia, we would have done it, right?

26:30.480 --> 26:31.920
We would have done it.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.480
We didn't have the things that we needed,

26:34.480 --> 26:36.080
the different things that are in it.

26:36.080 --> 26:37.520
Do you know what I'm saying right now?

26:40.800 --> 26:43.680
There's a hole for the earplugs that does the click.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.480
You're not going to do that on your iPod.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.840
Yeah, but here's the thing, Justin.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.760
You're not even going to do the one whole part.

26:50.880 --> 26:54.160
Steve Jobs made an iPod by himself.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.800
Yes, but I'm not saying he would make the iPod now,

26:56.800 --> 27:00.720
but he made the first iPod with stuff around his house.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.840
It would be so fucking cherry if Steve Jobs was alive

27:04.560 --> 27:05.920
so you could get it and be like,

27:05.920 --> 27:08.640
all right, all right, big man.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.720
You think you're so cool?

27:11.360 --> 27:14.480
Build another one with just the things in my house.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.160
It's a fun new clue.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.920
This week on Junkyard Wars,

27:17.920 --> 27:21.600
we have to take apart my fucking speak and spell

27:21.600 --> 27:25.440
and turn it into a functioning iPod, Steve.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.840
I think I could make an iPod.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.840
I think Travis could make an iPod.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.520
In what sense would it be an iPod?

27:32.800 --> 27:34.960
Well, it would function as an iPod.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.560
Now, here's what I would need.

27:37.520 --> 27:38.640
Here are the parts I would need.

27:39.520 --> 27:40.720
Some other iPods.

27:41.680 --> 27:42.800
This is, no, I won't accept that.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.240
No, no, no, listen, hear me out.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.400
One to take apart to see how it works.

27:47.040 --> 27:47.360
Okay, a burn.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.720
And one to listen to music while I build the other one.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.440
Because I don't want to sit there in silence

27:53.440 --> 27:55.040
while I build a new iPod.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.480
Yeah, and it is the only way to listen to music.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.120
What are you going to do?

27:57.120 --> 27:59.200
Have the band 21 Pilots come to your house

27:59.200 --> 28:01.680
and rock for you while you build it?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.960
What if that's the new iPod?

28:02.960 --> 28:04.880
We just take it into the meat space.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.480
And what it is is you just have a bunch of bands

28:08.480 --> 28:10.320
living in your house, a bunch of musicians.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.240
That's good for the global pandemic.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.920
Go ahead, Trav, and keep saying this.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.760
And then I just yell out loud,

28:16.880 --> 28:19.520
I want to hear 3 a.m.

28:19.520 --> 28:23.600
And Matchbox 20 comes down and plays the songs 3 a.m.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.000
Or I yell like, I want to hear Bent.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.480
And Matchbox 20 comes down and plays Bent.

28:30.240 --> 28:30.560
What?

28:31.120 --> 28:35.120
It sounds like you just kind of want to live with Matchbox 20.

28:35.120 --> 28:39.120
And I'm not even sure Matchbox 20 wants to live with Matchbox 20, Trav.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.120
Well, okay, fine.

28:41.120 --> 28:45.280
Then it's just, oh no, Rob Johnson.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.120
In that millisecond, you cease to be Travis Mako.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.960
In that like second and a half, you were-

28:50.960 --> 28:52.400
I don't even think that's his name.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.040
You were Todd Burnsley or something like that.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.880
You were not Travis Mako in that second and a half.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.360
Rob Thomas.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.040
What did you say?

28:59.040 --> 29:02.560
I said Rob Johnson, which I think was a local news anchor.

29:02.560 --> 29:07.680
Yeah, WSAC's own Rob Johnson, who once helped us get a kite out of a tree.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.240
Thank you, Rob, if you're listening.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.640
Rob Johnson does listen sometimes.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.920
Rob Johnson did come to a show in Indianapolis once.

29:15.920 --> 29:20.240
He is a morning news anchor for WSAC who once helped us get a kite out of a tree.

29:20.240 --> 29:23.760
If you would, please tweet at WSAC Rob Johnson

29:23.760 --> 29:27.280
and thank him for getting the McElroy brothers kite out of the tree that one time.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.720
It was a badass kite.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.640
And then tweet at Rob Thomas and see if he would like to live with me.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.200
Yeah, Trav's been looking for a roommate.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.920
He's been looking to expand the circle a little bit

29:37.920 --> 29:40.400
and he knows Rob Thomas has been locking it the fuck up.

29:40.960 --> 29:44.880
And I will name the room that he lives in the iPod.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.800
I'm just looking at Rob Johnson's Twitter feed

29:46.800 --> 29:48.480
to make sure everything is fine.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.160
How we looking, how we looking, Rob?

29:50.160 --> 29:52.000
In 2020, everything's doing good.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.600
It's all local news stories.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.480
I will say there's a tweet from June 4th where he says,

29:56.480 --> 30:00.400
WSAC and the CW are both having serious technical difficulties right now.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.520
Not sure what's happening.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.120
Our engineers are working on it.

30:03.120 --> 30:06.480
So I guess Rob has been out of the reporting game for a little bit

30:06.480 --> 30:08.480
since he can't get to the bottom of the case

30:08.480 --> 30:11.200
of what's happening at the radio of the TV station he works at.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.600
Rob, you get back on your grind,

30:13.600 --> 30:15.520
but I do appreciate you getting the kite out of the tree.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.160
Thank you for that.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.560
Fuck.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.320
No, I want him to know I appreciate him.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.280
He'll get a kick out of that.

30:21.280 --> 30:21.680
Okay.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.280
He'll get a big kick out of it.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.840
I went actually, as long as we're just telling stories

30:25.840 --> 30:29.040
of the impact of living here in Huntington, West Virginia.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.260
Were we?

30:31.040 --> 30:32.640
Yeah, because I was talking about Rob Johnson.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.520
And I went into Jolly Pirate Donuts on Saturday

30:38.080 --> 30:42.560
and the owner's son was there at the counter

30:42.560 --> 30:46.080
and he said, my dad loved when you guys talked about his Facebook

30:46.080 --> 30:49.600
posting, but my mom thought maybe you were making fun of him.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.360
I said, I'm not making fun of him.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.080
He put no baby beats the old man on the Facebook page

30:56.080 --> 30:57.760
next to a picture of donuts he made.

30:57.760 --> 31:03.760
And he continues to put up dope shit constantly.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.840
It's a premium follow if you haven't gotten on board

31:05.840 --> 31:08.000
with Jolly Pirate Donuts Facebook page yet.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.920
I said, no, don't change a thing.

31:09.920 --> 31:10.880
Please, I'm begging you.

31:10.880 --> 31:14.320
But his dad is now a big fan, even though he couldn't tell

31:14.320 --> 31:15.360
if we're making fun of him or not.

31:15.360 --> 31:20.000
So I want to clarify, no baby beats the old man

31:20.000 --> 31:22.160
and your donuts are so on point.

31:22.160 --> 31:22.960
They're so, so good.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.520
Thank you.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.760
And if you're in there already, get a Euro.

31:25.760 --> 31:26.800
They're delicious.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.280
Real quick, before we go to the money zone,

31:30.080 --> 31:34.160
we are going to be donating our ad revenue

31:34.160 --> 31:38.240
for the rest of June to various causes

31:38.240 --> 31:40.880
that are supporting Black Lives Matter,

31:40.880 --> 31:44.480
fighting against police brutality, supporting

31:44.480 --> 31:46.320
Black neighborhoods and Black voices.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.360
And we encourage you to do the same.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.760
Things are changing in the light of these protests,

31:55.200 --> 31:56.240
mostly for the better.

31:56.240 --> 32:00.560
And that is extremely encouraging, but stay active.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.600
And so, yeah, this week we are donating our ad revenue

32:03.600 --> 32:05.520
to Black Lives Matter National.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.560
We'll be tweeting out links.

32:06.560 --> 32:10.160
Obviously, they are at the forefront of this cause.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.880
And have been for as long as Black Lives Matter

32:12.880 --> 32:14.320
has been around.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.840
So yeah, we'll have links out for you to support them.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.520
But the ads you're about to hear

32:19.520 --> 32:22.720
are going to go directly to them.

32:22.720 --> 32:26.000
So with that said, let's go to the fricking money zone.

32:26.000 --> 32:38.960
I mean, you still got to send letters, don't you?

32:38.960 --> 32:41.440
You still got to send packages.

32:41.440 --> 32:46.480
You still got to send parcels and boxes and envelopes

32:46.480 --> 32:47.760
and all kinds of things, don't you?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.440
What about sacks of stuff?

32:49.440 --> 32:51.040
Sacks of stuff, thank you, Travis.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.200
You need to send all this stuff, but what are you going to do?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.320
Fan mail.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.200
Yeah, what are you going to do?

32:55.200 --> 32:57.120
Go to the post office where there's a bunch of crowds

32:57.120 --> 32:59.440
and expose yourself potentially to COVID-19?

32:59.440 --> 33:00.480
No, thank you.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.760
No, listen, I need to send these fan mails,

33:03.760 --> 33:07.760
but I don't want to get the COVIDs because of the fan mails.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.920
So stamps.com is here to help you out.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.080

You just use your computer

33:16.640 --> 33:18.080

33:18.080 --> 33:20.320

33:21.040 --> 33:23.280
And then you just leave it for your mail carrier

33:23.280 --> 33:24.960
or schedule a free package pickup

It's more than half.

That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.480
Stay safe, my friends.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.880
When I'm listening to my Rob Thomas beat,

33:57.440 --> 34:03.200
Rob Thomas solo work, Rob Thomas and Carlos Santana,

34:03.200 --> 34:06.160
Rob Thomas and Matchbox 20 or whatever,

34:06.160 --> 34:10.240
I know that not everybody wants to hear

34:10.240 --> 34:12.320
the musical stylings of Rob Thomas.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.160
Some people, their hearts are hardened.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.280
And when that happens, I'm going to put on my headphones.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.720
Now I know what you're wondering.

34:18.720 --> 34:22.480
Big clunky headphones with wires that get caught on?

34:22.480 --> 34:23.120
No.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.880
Well, that's what I wear.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.720
I'm nerd dingus.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.240
You're a nerd dingus.

34:28.240 --> 34:31.520
I'm going to wear cool wireless earbuds

34:31.520 --> 34:34.160
and here's the thing, they're comfortable.

34:34.160 --> 34:36.800
Oh, and now I know what else you're thinking.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.240
Oh, are you going to spend hundreds of dollars on a piece?

34:40.240 --> 34:40.720
Wow.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.920
No, grow up.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.560
I'm talking about Raycon earbuds.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.320
They start at about half the price

34:46.320 --> 34:49.200
of any other premium wireless earbuds on the market

34:49.200 --> 34:53.360
and they sound just as amazing as other top audio brands.

34:53.920 --> 34:58.160
Their newest model, the Everyday E25 earbuds,

34:58.160 --> 35:01.440
offer six hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing,

35:01.440 --> 35:03.360
more bass and a more compact design

35:03.360 --> 35:05.760
that gives you a nice noise isolating fit.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.760
And like I said, they're very comfortable.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.240
Sometimes with the earbuds, they fall out on my ears.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.440
There it is, I said it.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.920
They fall out on my ears, they're uncomfortable.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.800
I had, I was wearing the earbuds,

35:17.520 --> 35:20.160
I was doing the dishes, fell right out.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.440
Fell right out into the dishwasher.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.440
I'm going to barf, Trav, that sucks, man.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.880
But now with Raycon, it fits comfortably and it's in there.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.080
And they cost less, so if they fall in,

35:30.080 --> 35:32.640
you're like, fuck it, fire up the disposal by another one.

35:32.640 --> 35:33.760
This is what I'm saying.

35:33.760 --> 35:37.440
So now's the time to get the latest and greatest from Raycon.

35:37.440 --> 35:41.440

35:41.440 --> 35:45.360

35:48.160 --> 35:51.520
buyraycon.com slash my brother.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.560
Every day, statistics show that at least one new website

35:54.560 --> 35:56.000
enters the internet.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.200
And when you see it and you're like, whoa, another one,

35:59.200 --> 36:00.720
where, who is making these?

36:00.720 --> 36:03.280
And maybe it's a website from a furniture maker

36:03.280 --> 36:08.160
or a sports team or an athlete, spa, nutritionist,

36:08.160 --> 36:10.800
restaurant, artist, architects, whatever.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.760
Whoever the website is from, you're like,

36:13.760 --> 36:15.040
how did they make a website?

36:15.040 --> 36:18.320
Because this isn't a website for a website maker.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.840
That can be very confusing.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.400
But there's a good chance that they're harnessing

36:22.400 --> 36:26.960
the power of Squarespace to make their dreams into reality.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.160
Squarespace helps you to make a beautiful website

36:30.160 --> 36:33.600
that can showcase your work, sell your products and services,

36:33.600 --> 36:35.440
promote your physical or online business.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.080
And it's all with beautiful customizable templates

36:38.080 --> 36:41.200
created by world-class designers.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.040
And there's free and secure hosting

36:43.040 --> 36:44.880
and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

36:45.680 --> 36:50.640
So if you want to get going, get your ideas out there,

36:50.640 --> 36:53.040
you don't have to be a web designer

36:53.680 --> 36:54.880
to have a great looking website.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.760
You just need Squarespace.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.640
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother

36:58.640 --> 37:00.240

37:04.800 --> 37:06.320
of a website or a domain.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.480
I'm just real quick, Justin, just checking in.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.840
If I am a web designer, can I still use Squarespace?

37:11.840 --> 37:15.360
Yeah, I honestly felt like that was really hostile

37:15.360 --> 37:16.080
towards web designers.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.480
Yeah, I'm just wondering if I am a web designer,

37:18.480 --> 37:19.920
am I still allowed to use it?

37:19.920 --> 37:22.560
Like you really pulled their pants down

37:22.560 --> 37:24.320
and showed their ass to everybody.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.920
I left when you guys started this to go use Squarespace.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.520
Okay, I guess I'm just wondering,

37:27.520 --> 37:30.000
I guess I'm just wondering because I'd like to,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.400
I'd still like to use it if I could.

37:32.400 --> 37:35.600
And as you know, I went to web designer college

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
and got really good at web designing.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.720
And are you just saying that he's a dipshit now, I guess?

37:40.720 --> 37:42.960
Yeah, it kind of seemed like you thought

37:42.960 --> 37:45.840
my whole web designer degree was like a fart.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.440
It doesn't make any sense to me.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.360
Do I hear a little puppers barking in the background?

37:49.360 --> 37:51.440
Yeah, it's because she's a web designer too.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.080
Tell me about that puppers toe beads.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.560
Hey, I'm Jared Hill, co-host of the brand new

37:56.560 --> 37:58.560
Maximum Fun podcast, Fantai.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.160
And I'm Travelle Anderson.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.320
I'm the other more fabulous co-host.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.080
And the reason you really should be tuning in.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.440
I feel the nausea rising.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.560
To be Fantai is to be a big fan of something,

38:08.560 --> 38:12.960
but also have some challenging or anti-feelings toward it.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.080
Kind of like Kanye.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.520
We're all fans of Kanye.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.520
He's a musical genius, but like, you know.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.720
He thinks slavery is a choice.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.480
Or like the real Housewives of Atlanta.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.800
Like I love the drama, but do I want to see Black women?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.160
I love the drama, but do I want to see Black women

38:24.160 --> 38:25.040
fighting each other on screen?

38:28.960 --> 38:30.560
We're tackling all of those complex

38:30.560 --> 38:32.400
and complicated conversations about the people,

38:32.400 --> 38:33.920
places and things that we love.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.560
Even though they may not love us back.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.880
Fantai, Maximum Fun podcast.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.880
Do you have a munch quad or anything like that?

38:45.520 --> 38:46.800
I'd love to do that for you, Griffin.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.200
Uh, Griff, do you have a Yahoo?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.160
Well, now hold on.

38:50.160 --> 38:55.520
This seems, it's not, yeah, this is the worst trap.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.760
It's like if, if, if, if Charlie Brown said to Lucy,

38:59.760 --> 39:02.480
Hey, do you want to play the, are you going to pull the football away?

39:02.480 --> 39:04.400
She was like, yeah, I'm going to pull the football away.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.520
Do you want to come kick this football?

39:07.520 --> 39:08.240
All right, nevermind.

39:08.240 --> 39:08.880
I'll do Yahoo.

39:12.880 --> 39:13.680
All right, coward.

39:13.680 --> 39:28.400
I want to munch squad.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.320
Justin has a munch squad to do.

39:30.320 --> 39:30.720
Okay.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.880
That went in a sort of Southern rock direction.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.280
I love that fucking Molly Hatch up in here.

39:37.280 --> 39:43.280
Hey, this is a retro munch squad as brands

39:43.280 --> 39:47.120
continue to, for some cowardly reason,

39:47.920 --> 39:50.640
continue to not announce new products.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.400
The one exception is, I do have to point out,

39:56.400 --> 39:58.480
in the last literally two weeks,

39:58.480 --> 40:01.600
the one exception is June 8th.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.480
Today, checkers and rallies like,

40:05.280 --> 40:09.520
like opened the door, a crack to the room of people and said,

40:09.520 --> 40:13.280
Hey, we're introducing a mother cruncher chicken sandwich.

40:13.280 --> 40:13.520
Sorry.

40:13.520 --> 40:13.760
Okay.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.200
That's it.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.200
It's stupid.

40:17.200 --> 40:17.520
Nevermind.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.320
It's stupid.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.120
It's stupid.

40:19.120 --> 40:19.600
Nevermind.

40:20.400 --> 40:20.880
It's stupid.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.320
It's just, it's just an indulgent,

40:22.320 --> 40:23.520
craveable menu item.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.720
And we, I'm sorry.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.360
I'm sorry.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.080
It's stupid.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.400
There's obviously more important stuff.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.520
Just fucking forget about it.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.000
We'll take it off.

40:30.000 --> 40:30.800
We got it.

40:30.800 --> 40:36.320
We just, our fries, our fries have been consistently deemed

40:36.320 --> 40:37.920
the most craveable boy in the media.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.600
But it's just stupid.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.080
It's stupid.

40:40.080 --> 40:40.800
It's so stupid.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.760
I don't even know why I'm doing this.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.160
I'll leave.

40:42.720 --> 40:43.200
I'll leave.

40:43.200 --> 40:43.520
I'm sorry.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.240
We did checkerize the menu item though.

40:46.240 --> 40:46.560
Get it.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.360
The TLC needed for the perfect crunch and ideal toppings

40:49.360 --> 40:51.200
and signature squawk sauce.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.800
But the mother cruncher is stupid.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.680
I feel stupid.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.360
You would call it the mother cruncher.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.320
It's like, dumb.

40:56.320 --> 40:56.960
I'm going to leave.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.080
It's got onion rings on it.

40:58.080 --> 40:58.560
I'm going.

41:00.320 --> 41:00.880
I'm going.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.240
I'm going to leave.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.920
Red, ripe tomato, pickles.

41:05.680 --> 41:06.640
No, but okay.

41:06.640 --> 41:11.200
So this one is, I enjoyed very much.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.360
But it does require a little bit of setup

41:13.360 --> 41:16.000
because it is from Canada.

41:17.600 --> 41:21.040
Ryan sent us this way.

41:21.760 --> 41:24.960
And booster juice is like a juice chain.

41:24.960 --> 41:25.200
Wow.

41:26.320 --> 41:26.560
Okay.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.240
So I'm telling you that now.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.480
It's like where you can go in and buy juice for a smoothie

41:30.480 --> 41:30.880
or whatever.

41:30.880 --> 41:31.280
Got it?

41:31.280 --> 41:31.600
Yeah.

41:31.600 --> 41:31.840
Okay.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.280
Because the rest of this is so confusing

41:35.280 --> 41:36.800
that I need you to have a point.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.480
This is your constant, okay?

41:38.480 --> 41:41.040
That booster juice is a chain that sells juice.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.560
Do you understand this constant?

41:42.560 --> 41:42.880
Yeah.

41:42.880 --> 41:46.080
I'm tying my belt onto that pipe.

41:46.080 --> 41:46.720
Like at the end of Twister.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.840
Tie your belt on that pipe.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.880
Dale Wishawan, president and CEO of booster juice,

41:50.880 --> 41:53.840
announced the launch of booster juice game studios

41:53.840 --> 41:57.440
at the fit and fun zone grand opening in Toronto.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.600
He confirmed the newly formed game studio

41:59.600 --> 42:02.800
will feature several new and highly anticipated games.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.680
Consist now, how are they highly anticipated

42:05.680 --> 42:06.880
at before he announces them?

42:06.880 --> 42:07.760
No one knows.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.920
They're consisting of mind challenges,

42:10.560 --> 42:14.480
2D retro games and an interactive Microsoft kinetic,

42:15.920 --> 42:19.200
not anything, body motion detection games

42:19.200 --> 42:22.480
developed by bat.ca game studio.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.440
These tiles be made available exclusively

42:25.440 --> 42:27.680
at the Toronto Pearson international airport

42:27.680 --> 42:29.520
in the booster juice fit and fun zone.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.080
Wow.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.800
Fuck yeah, dude, I love mind puzzles.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.160
I love mind puzzles.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.000
So you're telling me I can go get some

42:36.640 --> 42:38.640
like powerful fruit juices

42:38.640 --> 42:41.200
and also have a kinetic body experience

42:41.200 --> 42:42.240
while I solve a mind puzzle?

42:42.240 --> 42:44.400
And you have to be in the airport.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.760
I don't know if you got that too.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.680
I mean, I'd buy me a ticket to anywhere, baby.

42:47.680 --> 42:50.320
I gotta get to this fucking booster juice.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.920
Hey, Jimmy, where do you wanna have

42:51.920 --> 42:53.920
your birthday party this year?

42:53.920 --> 42:55.600
Oh, at the booster juice in the airport.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.000
At the booster juice in the airport.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.480
The grand opening event launched a new store concept

43:00.480 --> 43:01.680
for booster juice,

43:01.680 --> 43:03.840
who transformed a passenger waiting area

43:03.840 --> 43:07.120
into a vibrant and interactive destination for commuters.

43:07.120 --> 43:10.320
The fit and fun zone was designed to embrace

43:10.320 --> 43:12.160
the booster juice lifestyle,

43:12.160 --> 43:14.720
offering nutritious and delicious smoothies,

43:14.720 --> 43:17.440
freshly squeezed juices, grilled food,

43:17.440 --> 43:18.640
grab and go items.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.240
In addition to dynamic concept

43:20.240 --> 43:21.920
that extends beyond the store

43:21.920 --> 43:24.640
to feature interactive large format games.

43:24.640 --> 43:27.040
The games are created to offer travelers

43:27.040 --> 43:29.840
the opportunity to stay active while on the go.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.600
Well, I do have to go to the airport

43:31.600 --> 43:32.560
to wait for a flight,

43:32.560 --> 43:34.160
but the good news is that I can play

43:34.160 --> 43:36.800
some huge interactive games at the juice store.

43:36.800 --> 43:37.680
So let me get this straight.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.200
You're flying from LA to Seattle.

43:39.200 --> 43:39.920
Yes, that's correct.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.640
And you want to connect in Toronto.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.000
Yes, absolutely.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.480
It is imperative.

43:46.480 --> 43:47.120
You don't understand.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.400
I've made it to level three.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.400
I really think this is,

43:50.400 --> 43:52.240
I'm making it to level four on this trip.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.480
They've got a new mind challenge.

43:54.480 --> 43:57.760
We're truly, truly excited about the grand opening

43:57.760 --> 44:00.560
of our fourth location at the Pearson airport,

44:00.560 --> 44:02.000
said Dale Wishwan.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.880
Our team is dedicated to pushing the envelope

44:04.880 --> 44:06.480
when it comes to store design.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.760
So working with them,

44:07.760 --> 44:10.560
working with the GTAA on the concept

44:10.560 --> 44:13.840
and Raul Bott on the loose of booster juice game studios

44:13.840 --> 44:15.280
has been fantastic.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.280
These games can be enjoyed by individuals

44:17.280 --> 44:19.040
of all ages and skill levels.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.760
So we hope people enjoy them as much as we do.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.680
Do you think that there's like an employee

44:23.680 --> 44:26.080
at that booster juice that when they came in

44:26.080 --> 44:27.840
and they started like setting up these games

44:27.840 --> 44:31.360
that they probably have poured a lot of money into

44:31.360 --> 44:33.440
to design their own games and install it,

44:33.440 --> 44:34.720
that there was an employee who was like,

44:34.720 --> 44:37.280
I have an old N64 that I could bring in

44:37.280 --> 44:38.400
if you guys just want,

44:38.400 --> 44:40.720
you know that there are like other games,

44:40.720 --> 44:42.560
there are games I could bring in games.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.680
Do you guys want games?

44:43.680 --> 44:45.440
At Toronto Pearson,

44:45.440 --> 44:47.280
we strive to provide our passengers

44:47.280 --> 44:49.920
with excellent food and dining choices

44:49.920 --> 44:53.840
and this all new interactive booster juice location

44:53.840 --> 44:57.120
in terminal three provides a fun and engaging experience

44:57.120 --> 44:58.800
for passengers of all ages,

44:58.800 --> 45:00.000
said Scott Collier,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.080
vice president of customer and terminal services.

45:02.080 --> 45:02.960
We're proud to be the home

45:02.960 --> 45:05.600
of the first and only booster juice

45:05.600 --> 45:07.600
fit and fun zone in the world.

45:07.600 --> 45:10.480
The thing that is so fucking wild to me about this,

45:11.360 --> 45:15.120
there is no store at the airport

45:15.120 --> 45:18.960
that needs to like broadcast its marketing message

45:18.960 --> 45:23.520
more than a 30 foot radius around itself, right?

45:23.520 --> 45:25.600
Am I gonna go to that booster juicer?

45:25.600 --> 45:29.200
No, I'll just go get a fucking Coke at the Burger King

45:29.200 --> 45:31.840
because it's actually five steps closer

45:31.840 --> 45:34.800
because I'm at the airport and I don't give a shit.

45:35.280 --> 45:36.640
So here's some game descriptions.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.140
Cool.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.760
The motion game immerses players

45:39.760 --> 45:42.320
in an intense and cinematic world,

45:42.320 --> 45:44.080
enabling players to use their body

45:44.080 --> 45:46.080
for the hyper realistic dynamic

45:46.080 --> 45:48.000
and interactive environment.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.760
Booster Juice Surf places the cool you in board shorts

45:53.760 --> 45:56.080
riding, this is fucking like meme guard,

45:56.080 --> 45:57.920
hold on, nonsense.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.960
Someone is shit posting in the middle of this press release.

46:00.960 --> 46:04.000
Booster Juice Surf places the cool you,

46:04.000 --> 46:07.040
that's in quotes, cool you in board shorts,

46:07.040 --> 46:10.240
riding a branded surfboard in the center of a giant wave.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.480
Points accumulate as you avoid dolphins and buoys

46:14.480 --> 46:15.280
while trying to keep your balance.

46:15.280 --> 46:20.160
What, hold on, I'm still back on the meme board shorts

46:20.160 --> 46:23.040
and you just introduce there's dolphins trying to get me.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.800
How are you putting the board shorts on me?

46:26.800 --> 46:29.600
That's not how like virtual anything works.

46:30.800 --> 46:34.240
Juice Bar Jumper is a 2D running style game

46:34.240 --> 46:37.840
and closely resembles the recognizable booster juice stores.

46:37.840 --> 46:38.560
What the fuck?

46:39.520 --> 46:41.920
So I'm running inside the, wait.

46:41.920 --> 46:45.680
Okay, now see, I'm still back on the dolphins.

46:45.680 --> 46:48.720
It says on the rules on the door of every booster juice

46:48.720 --> 46:50.480
that you're not allowed to run in there.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.160
So this is setting a bad example.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.480
This gets so wild, y'all.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.480
With incredibly cute illustrations

46:56.480 --> 46:58.240
and a suspenseful storyline,

46:58.240 --> 47:01.120
a strawberry speedily whiffs across the countertops,

47:01.120 --> 47:04.320
earning extra points upon collecting yummy blueberries.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.960
As time passes, the difficulty increases.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.000
I fucking heard that.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.040
Oh boy.

47:09.040 --> 47:13.120
In another 2D game, that same superstar character,

47:13.120 --> 47:14.800
a strawberry with a dashing smile,

47:15.440 --> 47:18.640
rides a booster juice cup like a rocket

47:18.640 --> 47:21.840
with fruits firing out instead of flames.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.800
He flies through the skies, avoiding evil candy,

47:24.800 --> 47:27.440
collecting tasty fruit and racking up the points.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.240
I'm not making this next part up.

47:31.280 --> 47:33.920
The third game unravels a darker,

47:33.920 --> 47:37.040
more riveting plot involving the destiny of the strawberry.

47:37.040 --> 47:40.480
Get the fuck out.

47:40.480 --> 47:43.440
This is a uniquely styled intense game

47:43.440 --> 47:45.440
with challenges above and below.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.480
Above and below means?

47:48.480 --> 47:52.080
Below like in heaven and hell, I guess it means.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.800
With challenges above and below

47:54.800 --> 47:56.640
where the player has to double tap

47:56.640 --> 47:59.760
to slip in between terrifying blenders.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.640
In these vibrantly drawn worlds,

48:02.640 --> 48:06.480
players must use a variety of skills to survive and gain points.

48:06.480 --> 48:06.980
Oh Jesus.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.920
This reads like the person writing it

48:09.920 --> 48:13.040
was being told about the existence of video games

48:13.040 --> 48:15.760
via telegraph through time travel.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.440
Like they were just getting bleeps and bloops

48:17.440 --> 48:19.520
of a portal opening and closing.

48:19.520 --> 48:22.640
Additional games were also designed to challenge your mind.

48:23.280 --> 48:26.080
These puzzles are formulated to make you think

48:26.080 --> 48:29.760
as you match fruit and test your reflexes.

48:29.760 --> 48:33.200
Certainly, the gameplay experience is enhanced

48:33.200 --> 48:36.240
while sipping one of booster juice's delicious smoothies.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.560
I like how that certainly is like an afterthought.

48:38.560 --> 48:42.800
Like, you should get the juice too.

48:42.800 --> 48:43.760
And the juice helps.

48:45.760 --> 48:46.800
I gotta get these games.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.960
I know E3 is fucking canceled this year

48:49.520 --> 48:50.560
and that's the right call,

48:50.560 --> 48:52.320
but I've been hurting for games.

48:52.320 --> 48:55.040
So I do need to get up to the Toronto airport.

48:56.320 --> 48:56.880
Yeah, so anyway.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.240
Wait, when is this article from?

48:59.200 --> 49:00.560
2016, it may still be there.

49:00.560 --> 49:01.600
It's probably still there.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.520
I hope it's still there.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.120
Can I do another Yahoo?

49:05.120 --> 49:06.640
Yeah, I'd love that.

49:06.640 --> 49:08.000
This one was sent out by Emma Kant

49:08.000 --> 49:09.360
and it's a real noodle scratcher.

49:09.360 --> 49:12.000
It's from Renan's Mama's Yahoo Answers user

49:12.800 --> 49:15.360
who I'm gonna call Davey asks,

49:16.800 --> 49:20.560
why do people like snails but discriminate slugs

49:21.120 --> 49:22.240
when it's the same person?

49:23.200 --> 49:24.800
A snail is just a slug wearing a shell.

49:26.240 --> 49:27.920
Without Googling, do the three of us

49:29.120 --> 49:31.600
agree with that statement or disagree?

49:32.480 --> 49:34.160
Is this snail a slug?

49:34.160 --> 49:36.720
With a shell.

49:36.720 --> 49:37.840
Now, do you mean literally?

49:37.840 --> 49:38.800
Do you mean literally?

49:38.800 --> 49:41.680
Like if I pull the shell off of a snail,

49:41.680 --> 49:42.880
does it become a slug?

49:42.880 --> 49:44.240
Or do you mean like are they closely related?

49:44.240 --> 49:45.280
Why do you wanna pull a shell off a snail,

49:45.280 --> 49:46.240
you fucking weirdo?

49:46.240 --> 49:47.520
I wouldn't, but I'm saying,

49:47.520 --> 49:48.640
is that what you're saying?

49:48.640 --> 49:49.840
You just said you wanted to,

49:49.840 --> 49:51.680
you fucking dirty weirdo.

49:51.680 --> 49:53.600
I said if I did.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.600
I feel like snails have little suction cups

49:55.600 --> 49:57.680
at the bottom of them and slugs don't.

49:57.680 --> 49:58.000
Okay.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
That is my, and I think that

50:00.560 --> 50:02.720
they're probably very closely related.

50:02.720 --> 50:04.640
And I bet if a slug sees a snail,

50:04.640 --> 50:06.400
he's like, oh shit, that looks cool.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.480
That fucking looks nice.

50:08.480 --> 50:10.560
I love that when salt starts pouring out on me.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.880
Oh, you think the slug's jealous of the snail?

50:14.080 --> 50:14.720
Obviously.

50:14.720 --> 50:15.840
I would go the other way

50:15.840 --> 50:18.400
because the snail has to drag that shit on its back.

50:19.360 --> 50:21.280
Yeah, but when the salt starts flying.

50:21.280 --> 50:22.640
You got a little hidey hole.

50:22.640 --> 50:27.680
Yeah, but like a slug is like a top-down convertible

50:27.680 --> 50:28.880
compared to a snail.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.560
Let's ask this question.

50:30.560 --> 50:31.920
And nobody's asking this question.

50:31.920 --> 50:34.320
We may be the first podcast to ever ask this question.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.960
Where are these snails getting these fucking shells?

50:36.960 --> 50:38.000
I live in Texas.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I live in the heart of Texas.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.600
We are not close to the ocean.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.960
So where are they getting these fucking shells from?

50:44.960 --> 50:48.320
I remember learning that like hermit crabs and stuff,

50:48.320 --> 50:50.240
like they will like, if they get too big,

50:50.240 --> 50:51.520
they will get a bigger shell

50:51.520 --> 50:53.680
and then another hermit crab will come along,

50:53.680 --> 50:56.160
like any kind of crab and take the smaller shell,

50:56.160 --> 50:56.960
but it's big for it.

50:56.960 --> 50:57.520
You know what I mean?

50:57.520 --> 50:58.960
And keep trading up

50:58.960 --> 51:00.080
and they'll all hang out together

51:00.080 --> 51:01.200
and like trade out shells.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.280
But where'd that fucking biggest shell come from?

51:04.320 --> 51:04.480
Yeah.

51:04.480 --> 51:04.960
Yeah.

51:04.960 --> 51:05.920
Or more importantly-

51:05.920 --> 51:06.720
What about the first shell?

51:06.720 --> 51:07.840
Where is the first shell?

51:07.840 --> 51:09.360
I live in the middle of Texas,

51:09.360 --> 51:10.400
not close to a beach,

51:10.400 --> 51:13.280
but there's snails all over my fence.

51:13.840 --> 51:16.000
There's gotta be people like going to the store

51:16.000 --> 51:17.680
buying a big bag of empty snail shells.

51:17.680 --> 51:20.160
Of little shells and dumping them all over the place.

51:20.160 --> 51:22.880
I do think snails are cool and cute

51:22.880 --> 51:23.680
and I like them.

51:23.680 --> 51:27.200
And I do think slugs are the worst.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.560
And I'm wondering,

51:28.560 --> 51:34.160
I think it might just be because the slug is naked

51:34.160 --> 51:38.080
and it looks like he's trying to be salacious a little bit.

51:38.640 --> 51:39.040
Whereas a snail-

51:39.040 --> 51:39.840
Not a great name.

51:40.880 --> 51:41.840
Slug, yeah.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.760
The name slug is bad,

51:43.760 --> 51:44.240
but-

51:44.240 --> 51:46.000
It's got ug right in there.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.120
It's got ug right in there.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.240
And I honestly,

51:48.240 --> 51:48.800
the slug,

51:48.800 --> 51:52.080
I feel like there's just more touchable surface on it

51:52.080 --> 51:53.120
that I don't want.

51:53.120 --> 51:54.160
And a snail is like,

51:54.160 --> 51:56.240
I could pick that up and not,

51:56.240 --> 51:57.680
and have it not ruin my day.

51:57.680 --> 51:59.360
But the slug, fucking no way.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.080
Forget about it.

52:00.080 --> 52:00.640
Well, maybe that,

52:00.640 --> 52:02.080
maybe it's the handle then.

52:02.080 --> 52:02.880
Because of the snail,

52:02.880 --> 52:03.200
you're like,

52:03.200 --> 52:04.880
I know exactly where to grab.

52:04.880 --> 52:06.480
If I need to pick that up,

52:06.480 --> 52:09.680
nature has given it a grip for me to pick up.

52:09.680 --> 52:12.320
There was like a potholder for the snail.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.480
Hey, where do they get those fucking shells though?

52:14.480 --> 52:16.640
Where do they get the shells?

52:16.640 --> 52:18.160
Do they make it?

52:19.360 --> 52:20.480
That's the wildest,

52:20.480 --> 52:22.320
there's no way that they make that.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.040
I wish there was some way to find this information.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.000
Snail shells.

52:26.000 --> 52:26.960
It's so hard.

52:26.960 --> 52:28.560
It's really frustrating to me.

52:29.920 --> 52:30.960
Hey Jeeves.

52:30.960 --> 52:32.400
No, you're not getting,

52:32.400 --> 52:33.360
don't search this.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.280
I don't want these snail shells come from.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.200
If anyone ever tweets to me

52:37.200 --> 52:39.120
about the reality about snails,

52:39.840 --> 52:41.280
you're sitting at home like,

52:41.280 --> 52:42.560
I'm getting so mad.

52:43.120 --> 52:44.080
I know this.

52:44.080 --> 52:44.720
Don't tell me.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.160
I don't want to know.

52:46.720 --> 52:48.560
I want to live in ignorance about this one.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.400
Let me have this little bit of magic.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.280
All right, please.

52:51.280 --> 52:53.680
Is it possible snails are just kind of carrying

52:54.320 --> 52:55.520
the same shells

52:55.520 --> 52:58.640
across the country, right?

52:58.640 --> 53:00.160
And so like a snail carries a shell

53:00.800 --> 53:04.960
to Lubbock and then beefs it.

53:04.960 --> 53:05.840
And then a snail is like,

53:05.840 --> 53:06.640
don't worry brother,

53:07.360 --> 53:08.320
I got it from here.

53:08.320 --> 53:09.840
I'll get this shell home.

53:09.840 --> 53:10.480
Do you know what I mean?

53:10.480 --> 53:13.520
It's sort of a shell shipping line.

53:14.320 --> 53:15.280
Are they all rentals?

53:15.840 --> 53:16.240
Maybe.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.320
What do you mean by that?

53:19.200 --> 53:22.800
You rent them at the shell store

53:22.800 --> 53:24.480
and then you keep them as long as you want.

53:24.480 --> 53:25.280
Okay.

53:25.280 --> 53:26.320
And then once they're worn out,

53:26.320 --> 53:28.320
you take them back in and get a brand new shell.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.120
No, Justin, that's silly.

53:29.120 --> 53:29.840
That's a lease.

53:30.400 --> 53:31.200
That's what you're talking about.

53:31.200 --> 53:31.840
They're leased.

53:32.720 --> 53:34.080
They've leased the shells.

53:34.880 --> 53:38.080
No, that implies that they could own them at a certain point.

53:38.080 --> 53:38.960
No, they're not leased to own.

53:38.960 --> 53:39.760
They're just leased.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.440
They have to return them every three years

53:41.440 --> 53:42.400
to the shell station.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.960
What is the difference between renting and leasing?

53:44.960 --> 53:46.320
I actually don't know this.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.440
Don't tell me.

53:47.440 --> 53:48.160
Yep.

53:48.160 --> 53:50.320
Leave that magic for Justin.

53:50.320 --> 53:51.040
What's it?

53:51.040 --> 53:53.360
Leave the magic for me about leasing and renting.

53:53.360 --> 53:56.960
Can you expand a little bit more on snail store?

53:56.960 --> 53:59.840
Like the idea, and I'm not even wondering about like

54:00.480 --> 54:03.200
where they secure a brick and mortar, a little one.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.720
Cause like I imagine they could do it

54:04.720 --> 54:06.640
in like a toadstool or some shit that they-

54:06.640 --> 54:09.200
No, it's a bigger shell that they go into.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.960
I think it's just the idea of snails having commerce

54:12.960 --> 54:15.680
that is, I'm struggling with right now, Juicer.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.640
Do you think it's just snails?

54:18.640 --> 54:22.400
Cause I would say turtles probably also need to like shop.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.320
No, the turtle, I saw a fucked up picture

54:24.320 --> 54:25.680
of an x-ray of a turtle.

54:25.680 --> 54:27.920
Folks, there's nothing inside there.

54:27.920 --> 54:29.120
That is the weird part.

54:29.120 --> 54:30.400
The shell is the turtle.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.320
It is wild.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.240
It is disappointing to learn that there's not

54:34.240 --> 54:35.680
like furniture and stuff in there.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.480
We hope you've enjoyed yourself listening

54:40.480 --> 54:42.080
to my brother, my brother, me and advice show

54:42.080 --> 54:43.280
for the modern era.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.880
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

54:44.880 --> 54:45.600
Wait, what?

54:45.600 --> 54:46.320
This is not what we-

54:46.320 --> 54:47.040
Oh no, we've started again.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.720
We don't walk it backwards.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.000
What are you doing?

54:50.000 --> 54:51.120
We forgot I knew.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.320
We've never done that.

54:52.320 --> 54:54.720
I want to say thank you to John Roderick

54:54.720 --> 54:56.480
and the Long Winters for these are our theme song.

54:56.480 --> 54:58.880
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed

54:58.880 --> 55:01.360
which you should go check out immediately.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.520
And other things you should check out immediately

55:03.520 --> 55:06.320
are the great podcasts on MaximumFun.org

55:06.320 --> 55:08.320
including Minority Corner.

55:08.320 --> 55:11.440
Again, huge thank you to James for allowing us

55:11.440 --> 55:15.120
to do a feed drop last week in lieu

55:15.120 --> 55:16.400
of one of our regular episodes.

55:16.400 --> 55:21.120
I also want to shout out Fantai, which Jarrett

55:21.120 --> 55:24.400
and Travelle allowed us on Wonderful, another podcast I do

55:24.400 --> 55:26.640
to do a feed drop of their most recent episode

55:26.640 --> 55:30.160
which I highly encourage everyone to go listen to

55:31.040 --> 55:34.640
because it is illuminating and brilliant

55:34.640 --> 55:38.560
and all about sort of what the country is going through

55:38.560 --> 55:40.080
right now and has been going through

55:40.080 --> 55:42.640
for a very, very long time.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.240
So go check that out also.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.360
And along those same lines, reminder,

55:47.360 --> 55:50.240
we'll be tweeting the links to Black Lives Matter's national

55:50.240 --> 55:55.360
seeing donate there and also go to macroemerch.com.

55:55.360 --> 55:58.640
We have a couple of new things there

55:58.640 --> 56:00.640
but the one I'm really excited to tell you about

56:00.640 --> 56:03.520
is the Phantasmal and Resplendent pin

56:03.520 --> 56:05.520
as well as the Good Out Here T-shirt.

56:06.320 --> 56:08.560
Both of those are Adventure Zone references.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.840
That's another podcast we do

56:09.840 --> 56:11.360
that hopefully you also know about

56:12.080 --> 56:13.760
and the proceeds from those are gonna go

56:13.760 --> 56:17.360
to the Trevor Project, which is another great organization

56:17.360 --> 56:18.800
that you should consider donating to.

56:18.800 --> 56:22.800
And let's see, we said we're gonna check out

56:22.800 --> 56:25.200
Maximum Fun Shows, pre-order The Adventure Zone

56:25.200 --> 56:26.320
graphic novel book three.

56:26.320 --> 56:29.280
If you haven't yet, theadventurezonecomic.com.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.880
Shit, that comes out soon, huh?

56:30.880 --> 56:33.280
Yeah, like a month, like a month from now.

56:33.280 --> 56:34.160
We should finish it.

56:34.960 --> 56:35.440
Oh, yeah.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.040
We should probably start it.

56:38.560 --> 56:40.880
I'll start drawing with my crayons.

56:41.440 --> 56:41.940
Okay.

56:42.640 --> 56:43.600
Thanks for listening.

56:43.600 --> 56:44.480
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

56:44.480 --> 56:46.240
I do have a final Yahoo.
