WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.560
Happy birthday, Patricia Heaton. This is our special Patricia Heaton birthday episode of

00:50.560 --> 00:57.440
My Brother, My Brother, Me, an invite show for the modern era and also Chaz Bono.

00:57.440 --> 01:04.560
Did you just Google Wikipedia and then on Wikipedia,

01:05.200 --> 01:09.360
did you Google birthdays on March 4th? This is our Bono Heat episode.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.520
Bono Heat honoring Chaz Bono and Patricia Chaz Bono, Chaz Bono, Patricia Heaton.

01:18.960 --> 01:24.400
I bet you Patricia Heaton would fucking hate Chaz Bono because she's a very close-minded,

01:24.400 --> 01:30.640
she seems very conservative to me. Yeah, she is. Is she the mom from Tool Time Show?

01:32.080 --> 01:36.560
Yeah, she's mom from Tool Time and she is mom from the middle,

01:36.560 --> 01:43.920
but not mom from Malcolm in the Middle. Common mistake. Really? What a small world. I know.

01:45.040 --> 01:53.040
And who is Chaz Bono from? Chaz Bono is from Mermaids and Sonny and Cher. Okay.

01:53.040 --> 01:59.360
Also Rick Perry, so it's a cool day. March 4th here on My Brother, My Brother, Me,

01:59.360 --> 02:05.040
it's sort of our Patricia Heaton, Chaz Bono, Rick Perry themed episode. So all of our questions

02:05.600 --> 02:10.880
will in some way have to do with those three celebrities. If you don't see the connection,

02:10.880 --> 02:14.240
you're probably just not thinking. The first person to respond with an email

02:14.240 --> 02:21.360
that lists the connection between all of the emails and either Bono, Heaton, or Perry.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.760
Oh, I got it. But, Griffin, you can't participate because you work for the show.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.120
But I know the answer. But you can't say it.

02:29.120 --> 02:34.160
But the three of them fucked. The three of them fucked that one time all together.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.360
Well, what does that have to do with any of the questions we're about to answer?

02:37.360 --> 02:42.080
Unless all of the questions are about that time when Rick Perry, Chaz Bono,

02:42.080 --> 02:47.360
and Patricia Heaton fucked. Yesterday, and as long as we're talking big news stories,

02:47.360 --> 02:55.200
uh, recently, uh, Dennis Rodman traveled to North Korea to meet with Kim Jong Un.

02:55.200 --> 03:02.400
Uh, and the headline, the big opinion, the popular, popular reaction from media critics

03:02.400 --> 03:09.920
is that he did not perform well. The, the CNN headline is Rodman Fouls Out in North Korea.

03:09.920 --> 03:15.920
And I would just like to join with my media brothers and sisters in our disbelief

03:15.920 --> 03:23.280
that Dennis Rodman did not handle international diplomacy, uh, with North Korea.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.200
Our final hope has failed us.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.920
Our last chance, like sending Bruce Willis to destroy the media,

03:29.920 --> 03:33.680
Meteor and Armageddon. Dennis Rodman has failed us.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.240
Is it possible that he did like a passable job?

03:36.240 --> 03:38.720
He just really wanted to use that fouled out pun.

03:38.720 --> 03:44.880
I mean, just showing up is half the thing, isn't it? And like, nobody else has showed up.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.440
How come? Hey, Obama, give him a fucking call.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.520
Hey, Obama, why don't you give him a fucking call and maybe talk it over?

03:51.520 --> 03:54.720
They have nukes, guys. I'm spooked. Spooked about their nukes.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.640
We're nuke spooked. And we just want you to pick up the phone and call that little guy.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.720
Why don't you fucking give him a ring?

04:02.720 --> 04:07.600
Let's say he's adorable, but he's also, he's probably just as scared as we are.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.760
And he's more afraid of us than we are of him, except that we're really afraid of him.

04:11.760 --> 04:20.000
I'm not as afraid of I am as Dennis. Let me start over. My fear of them and their nukes,

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
my nuke spookedness, is not nearly as crazy high as my general Dennis Rodman discomfort.

04:28.960 --> 04:34.560
My Dennis comfort. Even seeing that fucking guy. It's not great.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.800
It's a bad situation.

04:36.800 --> 04:41.440
It's like he looks like he survived a trap from one of the Saw movies.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.400
It's rough stuff.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.640
What if he had rolled up and just been like the most amazing diplomat

04:46.640 --> 04:52.000
and Kim Jong would have walked out going, I'm sorry. I see it now.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.400
Rodman on North Korea. We cool.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.640
He says, apparently we cool. We cool with North Korea.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.800
He fixed it. He fixed it all.

05:00.800 --> 05:07.440
This is an advice show where we take your queries and turn them Acme-like into wisdom.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.680
Here's my first advice. Obama, pick up the phone.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.920
Let's rip off the top and guzzle it down.

05:16.800 --> 05:23.440
Hi, I'm a 22 year old girl and I have a problem with what I call nerd rage.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.200
Seems to be getting in the way of my dating life.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.920
Guys don't seem to like it when I let it out, but it's almost involuntary.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.600
Once someone brings up an X-Men movie, I start going off on 20 minute tangents

05:33.600 --> 05:38.320
without realizing I'm even doing it or getting into hours long arguments

05:38.320 --> 05:40.640
over who would win between Loki and the Hulk.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.760
I've tried dating not nerdy guys to avoid the arguments,

05:45.760 --> 05:51.920
but I would die a little inside every time a doctor who reference falls on deaf ears.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.200
What should I do? Should I tone down the nerdiness

05:55.200 --> 05:58.960
or just keep waiting for David Tennant himself to whisk me away?

05:58.960 --> 06:02.560
That's from Alonzi in Charlotte, North Carolina.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.160
Listen, we're all waiting for that day.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.800
Yeah, we all want David Tennant to scroll up.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.120
Even if it's just like a friend romance.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.840
We are all happily engaged or married.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.840
And if Tennant knocked down a door, we could not say no.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.080
Justin, quiet, get yourself an adventure.

06:18.080 --> 06:18.640
Like, all right, baby.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.560
Justin, get in more books.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.200
Get in more spaceship, Justin.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.560
We're going on an adventure.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.800
I can honestly say that if David Tennant walked in the house,

06:30.800 --> 06:34.000
I would get super like little puppy excited and I'd look at Teresa

06:34.000 --> 06:35.920
and she would just kind of go like, go ahead.

06:37.120 --> 06:37.920
She'd understand.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.160
She would sing a refrain from Jolene.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.400
Yeah, I mean, this is...

06:45.200 --> 06:47.760
Just FYI, let me go ahead and preface this by saying,

06:47.760 --> 06:51.440
I don't think that this is like because you're a girl having nerd rage.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.600
I think that anybody who does this, it's kind of a turn off.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.840
It can be a bit of a turn off.

06:57.840 --> 07:03.360
Yeah, it's, you know, there's so many real things to be upset about.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.600
Like North Korea, Dennis Robbins over there messing that up.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.040
Like get angry about that.

07:09.040 --> 07:09.600
That's a real thing.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.560
There's like social issues and stuff that if you bring it up,

07:12.560 --> 07:15.280
everyone's going to go, oh yeah, I agree too.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.640
I'm also mad about that.

07:16.640 --> 07:23.120
The problem that I've found consistently with nerd arguments or what have you

07:23.120 --> 07:28.800
is depending on the setting, you're almost always alienating somebody.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.040
There's almost always someone who doesn't know the source material as well as you

07:33.040 --> 07:35.120
or like is completely oblivious.

07:35.120 --> 07:39.200
And that can make for a kind of unwelcoming social experience for anybody.

07:39.200 --> 07:46.320
I mean, I love my nerdy escapism as much as the next guy,

07:46.320 --> 07:52.880
but I find that it can have kind of a chilling effect on your social engagements.

07:52.880 --> 07:57.440
I also find that in my life that it's like timing is everything.

07:57.440 --> 08:02.560
Like, yeah, I've had real long debates with people about who was the best Doctor Who

08:03.120 --> 08:07.280
or about the Superman movies or the Batman movies.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.960
Lots of arguments about Avatar the cartoon versus Avatar the movie.

08:10.960 --> 08:16.000
And but I don't do it every conversation I have.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.520
Like I have the one friend that I have my Doctor Who discussions with.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.400
I got the friend that I talk about cartoons with.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.160
I have a friend I talk about comic books with.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.680
And then even that is maybe like five percent of the time.

08:28.400 --> 08:33.040
You know, there's an appropriate time when that conversation happens organically

08:33.040 --> 08:37.120
and not like, oh, I see that you own a Wolverine origins.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.960
Now, let me tell you why that movie sucks.

08:39.680 --> 08:41.840
You know, yeah, I think I'm about to do that.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.280
I have a problem with you.

08:43.280 --> 08:48.720
I'm about to come to your guys houses and duct tape your butt cheese together.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.640
Why fucking nerd lords?

08:50.640 --> 08:52.640
OK, what are you talking about?

08:52.640 --> 08:57.120
I just I don't I don't party on these kinds of because it's it's

08:57.680 --> 09:01.280
is there a topic for Mario Brothers that says don't hate the player,

09:01.280 --> 09:02.000
hate the game.

09:02.000 --> 09:02.480
You're welcome.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.120
Hot topic.

09:03.120 --> 09:03.620
Go on.

09:05.040 --> 09:12.160
What I'm saying is if it wasn't Doctor Who or if it wasn't, you know, comic books,

09:12.160 --> 09:17.120
if it was sports or if it was wine or if it was sport wine,

09:17.120 --> 09:19.840
which is a new kind of wine that I'm doing, it's kind of like Gatorade.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.640
It's kind of like the Gatorade of wine.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.080
But it gets you messed up.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.360
Yeah, it gets you really fucked up.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.480
So it's not good for like if you have to throw or catch the football

09:27.200 --> 09:31.200
or really run into anybody, it's it's still an R&D.

09:31.760 --> 09:35.120
Anyway, it's snobbishness regardless of what it is.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.720
And like some people can party on that.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.880
But like even if they are of equal level nerdiness than you,

09:40.880 --> 09:44.800
is that really how you want to like found a relationship?

09:44.800 --> 09:46.960
So your point being Gervin, it's not content.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.360
Yeah, it's not the content, it's the tone.

09:49.360 --> 09:53.280
Because if you're like if you're like a fan of a specific baseball team, right?

09:53.280 --> 09:57.040
And then somebody brings up baseball and you launch into this half hour long

09:57.040 --> 10:01.840
diatribe about why the Cincinnati Reds are the greatest baseball team

10:01.840 --> 10:05.360
and everybody else sucks and you're like really heated and angry about it.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.760
Yeah, nobody's going to like that.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.000
No, especially people sitting around you going,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.760
yeah, I don't care about baseball at all.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.240
Yeah, yeah.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.840
And everybody cares about baseball.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.840
Fewer people care about Dr. Who.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.520
I have to see the math on that.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.080
Gervin, can you read us a Yahoo question?

10:24.960 --> 10:25.600
Yeah, sure.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.480
I can I can do that.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.760
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.720
Are you Ira Ray?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.560
I'm on Colmeds.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.040
I'm sorry.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.240
I know, but I just had this moment of like sheer horror all right.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.440
What if he doesn't do it?

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
And I really I've got I've become Pavlovian like trained to be like,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.520
but we hold on.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.880
He's saying, say it.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.920
Say it.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.000
Yeah, I hear it in my sleep now.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.360
I hear it when people say things that sound like Ira Ray, which is weird.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.080
Anyway, thank you.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.360
Do you have an IRA?

10:53.360 --> 10:54.160
Who wants to know?

10:56.160 --> 10:59.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Wolf Runa who asks,

11:01.120 --> 11:04.000
who would win in a fight between the dad in the Wonder Years

11:04.000 --> 11:05.760
and the dad in Happy Days and why?

11:07.440 --> 11:09.120
They both rule a strict house,

11:09.120 --> 11:11.520
but who'd win in a fight between the two behemoths?

11:11.520 --> 11:15.600
This is the best.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.400
Oh, God.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.320
Speaking of nerd rage,

11:18.320 --> 11:21.040
like too much time has been spent figuring out who would win in a fight

11:21.040 --> 11:22.560
like Superman and the Hulk.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.960
We need to get more like who would win in a fight

11:24.960 --> 11:28.080
Wilson from Home Improvement or Comet the dog.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.080
Wilson would beat Comet to death with his own hands.

11:32.080 --> 11:32.800
So who we got?

11:32.800 --> 11:34.000
Dad from Wonder Years.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.880
Jack Wonder Years.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.160
Jack Wonder Years.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.520
Papa Cunningham.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.840
Papa Cunningham is Tom Bosley, correct?

11:46.640 --> 11:49.360
I didn't watch any TV that was on the air before.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.240
It's the Boz.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.200
It's the Boz, right?

11:51.200 --> 11:51.440
Okay.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.240
It's the Boz.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.560
And then you got the...

11:58.160 --> 11:58.560
Come on.

11:58.560 --> 12:02.560
Indomitable Dan Laria as the dad from the Wonder Years.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.760
And he is a big...

12:03.760 --> 12:04.960
I mean, he is a...

12:04.960 --> 12:05.680
He fucking...

12:05.680 --> 12:07.360
I watched that show late.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.600
I watched that show in like college

12:09.600 --> 12:11.280
and he fucking scared me.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.480
He was scary.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.760
He's a scary man.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.760
I haven't seen a lot of Happy Days,

12:15.760 --> 12:18.000
but I want to know what episodes this person is watching

12:18.000 --> 12:18.800
where they're like,

12:18.800 --> 12:21.760
Tom Bosley runs a strict house.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.600
This is a tough house, Tom.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.640
God, Tom Bosley is tight-fisted.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.080
Everybody gets one.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.360
You get one more and you're out.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.920
Do you remember the episode where Tom Bosley

12:31.920 --> 12:33.920
just beat the shit out of Fonzie

12:33.920 --> 12:35.920
for leaving the light on in the bathroom?

12:36.800 --> 12:38.240
He's not even his son.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.400
That's a tight household, Mr. Cunningham.

12:40.400 --> 12:40.960
Crazy.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.520
I think Wonder Years' dad would eat him alive.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.560
Oh, yeah.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.680
Are you kidding me?

12:47.680 --> 12:49.680
Dan Laria plays Vince Lombardi.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.680
Okay, okay.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.400
But you guys,

12:53.280 --> 12:56.080
Bosley is clearly more cunning, ham.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.360
And so he's gonna win in the Battle of Wills.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.560
Was that the whole thing?

13:00.560 --> 13:03.360
No, I actually didn't realize till about halfway through

13:03.360 --> 13:04.480
that that's where I was going with it.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.600
But then you followed it.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.960
But then I went with it.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.320
I took that rabbit hole.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.440
Can I come at you with this?

13:10.400 --> 13:12.480
Uncle Phil versus...

13:13.680 --> 13:16.240
Oh, I can't remember Reginald Bell Johnson's character's name

13:16.240 --> 13:17.120
for Family Matters.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.800
But I can remember his name is Reginald Bell Johnson.

13:18.800 --> 13:19.760
Carl Winslow.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.320
Oh, God.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.800
It's Uncle Phil, because here's the thing.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.000
It was always, I mean, not even under the surface,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.960
that Uncle Phil had a violent streak.

13:28.960 --> 13:33.440
He threw DJ Jazzy Jeff like 20 yards a day

13:33.440 --> 13:38.880
for all of the great work Will Smith did on that series

13:38.880 --> 13:41.680
of making African Americans non-threatening.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.640
Uncle Phil was right behind him, undoing it,

13:44.640 --> 13:45.680
moment by moment.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.240
Just throwing DJ Jazzy Jeff.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.760
I'm a white suburban guy.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.440
I'm trying to not be afraid of you.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.000
And Uncle Phil is throwing your people.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.400
He is watching African Americans at his front door.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.480
In the years that I've watched this show,

14:00.480 --> 14:02.080
it has only just now occurred to me

14:02.080 --> 14:05.520
that the neighbors of Uncle Phil and his family,

14:05.520 --> 14:08.080
about once a week are looking out their window

14:08.080 --> 14:11.760
to see a scrawny black man being launched out the door.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.800
What do they think is going on in that house?

14:14.800 --> 14:15.520
How is it?

14:15.520 --> 14:20.560
How does Uncle Phil figure out that Will is the one

14:20.560 --> 14:23.680
making them look bad in their DJ Jazzy neighborhood?

14:23.680 --> 14:24.320
Right?

14:24.320 --> 14:27.440
Phil is trying to blend in, in Bel Air,

14:27.440 --> 14:31.120
and meanwhile he's throwing black people out his front door.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.840
And there was an episode, if I remember correctly,

14:33.840 --> 14:36.720
where Uncle Phil sits on a rabbit and kills it.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.360
What does that have to do with anything?

14:41.360 --> 14:43.680
I'm just saying that's scary as shit.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.520
Carl Winslow never sat on a rabbit.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.160
Despite the fact that Reginald Will Johnson,

14:49.520 --> 14:53.440
as TV's Carl Winslow, is armed and dangerous

14:53.440 --> 14:55.360
because he's a fucking police officer,

14:56.160 --> 14:58.320
you think that Uncle Phil's sitting power-

14:58.320 --> 15:04.960
When Carl Winslow is ejecting Steve Urkel from the house,

15:04.960 --> 15:06.560
he uses his words.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.680
Yeah, and to be fair,

15:07.680 --> 15:12.480
I never saw Carl Winslow's hand where his hip be at.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.040
That would have been a great episode

15:15.040 --> 15:17.680
if half the episode was just him spent in therapy

15:17.680 --> 15:20.320
filling out paperwork for having to discharge his weapon

15:20.320 --> 15:22.560
to kill a rabbit that was on the couch.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.640
Maybe you didn't fucking watch Die Hard,

15:24.640 --> 15:27.760
which is part of the Winslow-verse.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.480
It is in the Winslow-verse.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.560
I could convince myself of this, by the way.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.520
I mean, he plays that cop in like 19 movies.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.600
Oh, that's real nice, Trav.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.560
Real nice.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.880
I mean, that funny buddy, he's just afraid to shoot people.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.800
What other than Die Hard and Die Hard 2?

15:45.520 --> 15:47.280
Oh God, now you can put me on the spot.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.080
Yeah, I put you on the spot

15:48.080 --> 15:49.360
because you're talking out of your ass.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.440
No, you also did it in Family Matters.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.840
Family Matters.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.040
Family Matters, the movie.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.080
There were like 100 episodes of that.

15:58.080 --> 15:58.720
He was a cop in all of them.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.200
You can think of Die Hard as being a long

16:01.200 --> 16:03.680
and confusing episode of Family Matters.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.320
I believe, if I'm not mistaken,

16:06.320 --> 16:08.800
I think he was also that cop in Ghostbusters.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.880
I think that was a ghost.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.600
Dead Carl Winslow.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.800
I'm just going over his IMDB page right now,

16:16.800 --> 16:20.160
looking for any kind of character that's just listed as

16:20.160 --> 16:21.520
cop who's afraid to shoot gun.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.600
I'll get back to you.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.920
I had someone on my paper route when I was younger,

16:25.920 --> 16:27.520
his last name was Bosley,

16:27.520 --> 16:29.760
and I convinced myself that it was Tom Bosley

16:29.760 --> 16:32.720
living a life of prophecy in Huntington, West Virginia.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.160
In Huntington, West Virginia?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.000
Tom Bosley just couldn't handle the attention

16:36.000 --> 16:37.280
in Pavarazzi anymore.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.320
All of the getting out of the limo shots

16:40.320 --> 16:41.840
where his vagina was showing,

16:41.840 --> 16:43.760
he just couldn't stand the attention.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.760
All the Father Dowling heads chasing him around,

16:47.760 --> 16:49.760
trying to get their pick with Father Dowling.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.480
All the sex tapes, drug scandals,

16:52.480 --> 16:54.560
Tom Bosley just could not handle it anymore.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.600
Tom Bosley, you're missed.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.120
Yeah, I do.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.400
I do miss Tom Bosley.

17:01.440 --> 17:06.000
I guess that is one advantage that Dan Loria has over

17:06.000 --> 17:10.560
Tom Bosley is being corporeal, I guess.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.280
This is one thing that's good about Dan Loria

17:13.280 --> 17:16.000
is that he's alive, so that is helpful.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.680
I mean, that's a big plus.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.920
But as angry as he is, though,

17:22.400 --> 17:24.240
counting down the days over here,

17:24.240 --> 17:26.640
that takes a toll on a man's heart, you know?

17:27.280 --> 17:27.920
Yeah, no kidding.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.360
Especially when a man is that big and that threatening.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.160
Okay, semifinals.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.040
Semifinals?

17:36.240 --> 17:37.440
Hey, we're gonna bracket this.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.920
I'm not trying this, we're doing it.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.400
To be fair, Dan Loria in 2014 is starring in a movie

17:44.400 --> 17:48.640
called Icky, An American Dog Story, as Paul Puccini.

17:48.640 --> 17:52.480
So he probably wishes that Tom Bosley had killed him.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.760
Every day.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.360
Every day he wishes Tom Bosley...

17:57.360 --> 17:58.240
What could have been?

17:58.240 --> 18:00.000
Why did you finish the job, Tom?

18:02.960 --> 18:06.480
So here's another question from one of our users.

18:07.440 --> 18:11.440
Recently, I've been feeling that I think about things too much.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.680
Sometimes I find I'm unable to take action

18:13.680 --> 18:15.440
because I'm busy thinking about what might happen.

18:15.440 --> 18:19.040
Case in point, I recently helped my friend DJ a dance party

18:19.040 --> 18:21.760
and a girl I don't know came up and tried to dance with me.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.320
I wasn't dancing before.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.040
And rather than getting out on the floor and having a good time,

18:27.040 --> 18:29.040
I thought about the reasons why I shouldn't

18:29.040 --> 18:30.640
or why it wouldn't be appropriate.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.040
Pretty soon, this girl makes some excuses and left.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.120
I wasn't able to have any fun because I was thinking too hard.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.680
Is this a problem or is it just a personality trait?

18:41.680 --> 18:44.320
And that's from Introspective in Indiana.

18:46.640 --> 18:47.760
Before we get to the question,

18:47.760 --> 18:49.920
I want to say that the thing that caught me is

18:49.920 --> 18:51.760
all the excuses why you shouldn't.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.320
Like what?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.320
What was it?

18:57.280 --> 18:58.720
Was it like a kid's party?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.400
That's a pretty good fucking excuse.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.040
Were there snakes on the dance floor?

19:06.400 --> 19:07.920
This party is at McDonald's.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.760
We're in the play place.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.880
What are you talking about?

19:10.880 --> 19:12.560
The floor is lava.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.040
I mean, okay, yes, it is a personality trait.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.680
And personality traits, I think, are only a problem

19:17.680 --> 19:19.920
if they're impacting your happiness.

19:19.920 --> 19:20.960
I mean, that's when they become-

19:22.400 --> 19:23.520
I guess it depends on,

19:23.520 --> 19:26.320
is this you saying that you think things through?

19:27.120 --> 19:30.080
Or is this you saying you have a hard time making decisions

19:30.080 --> 19:34.640
because you're thinking about every different possible outcome?

19:37.520 --> 19:38.960
That's not a bad trait to have.

19:38.960 --> 19:43.760
You just have to know that when an attractive person is,

19:43.760 --> 19:45.360
stranger is dancing with you,

19:45.360 --> 19:48.400
that you have to shut that voice that you just gotta fuck up.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.840
I feel like this is an issue that I have in real life,

19:51.840 --> 19:55.360
or I did, but I've been making a very strong effort

19:55.360 --> 19:58.000
over the last two or three years to stop doing it,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.920
and my life is like a thousand times better.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.240
Because every so often, that's a good thing.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.360
When it's deciding how you want to do your health insurance

20:05.360 --> 20:07.920
or a payment plan for something.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.360
I want to meet someone who's impetuous

20:09.360 --> 20:10.320
about their health insurance.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.040
I don't know.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.160
Let's still catch the wind.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.120
PPO?

20:13.120 --> 20:14.400
PP, I have no idea.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.280
Let's do it.

20:15.280 --> 20:15.840
Just do it.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.880
Sign me up.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.000
Do I want a new car?

20:18.000 --> 20:18.640
Sure, I do.

20:19.840 --> 20:20.320
Oh, no.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.680
Whoops, I got dog insurance on myself.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.240
That's okay.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.840
I'm gonna have a luscious coat.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.760
If someone's like, hey, you want to go see a movie?

20:28.480 --> 20:28.980
Yeah.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.200
Don't sit there and go,

20:31.200 --> 20:32.400
I don't know if I see that movie

20:32.400 --> 20:33.840
while I beat two tires tonight,

20:33.840 --> 20:36.880
and I was saving money in that extra $8 maybe.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.640
Like, if you want to go, dude, do it.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.400
If you want to dance with the girl, do it.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.280
Don't sit there and go,

20:41.280 --> 20:43.360
well, what if it turns out that she has a boyfriend,

20:43.360 --> 20:45.360
and then he beats me up, and I break my leg,

20:45.360 --> 20:46.800
and I lose my track scholarship,

20:46.800 --> 20:47.840
and then I end up homeless.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.000
No, if you have a track scholarship,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.600
you need to keep your head on a fucking swivel.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.240
Because everything out there wants to break your ankles.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.920
I'll tell you one thing that I've been doing lately

20:57.920 --> 21:00.880
that has kind of helped me deal with this,

21:00.880 --> 21:03.360
because I absolutely have a problem with this.

21:03.360 --> 21:07.840
And it surprised its negativity.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.240
I remind myself that basically,

21:13.440 --> 21:15.600
everything bad that has ever happened to me,

21:16.480 --> 21:18.560
I never have seen that shit coming.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.080
I never think, like, something bad's coming,

21:22.080 --> 21:22.880
and then it does.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.560
It's that I think everything's cool,

21:26.560 --> 21:28.000
and then it gets very bad.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.560
So, like, the very fact that you have even thought

21:32.560 --> 21:34.880
about a negative outcome means that

21:34.880 --> 21:37.200
that's probably not the one that's gonna happen.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.320
So, like, just, just get over it.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.200
Just go with it.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.040
And bad things are gonna happen.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.400
Absolutely.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.600
A ship in harbor is safe.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.280
But that's not what ships were made for.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.240
They were made for sailing to adventure with Captain Ron.

21:54.240 --> 21:59.120
You are a ship, and Captain Ron is beckoning you to adventure,

21:59.120 --> 22:01.280
and you need to just pile on board.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.080
You could have had this lady on your, on your mast.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.360
Wait, hold on.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.440
What's the front thing on the front?

22:09.440 --> 22:11.520
Your, your, the mermaid statue?

22:11.520 --> 22:12.320
Your figurehead.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.840
This girl could have been the mermaid statue.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.800
The prow.

22:16.800 --> 22:22.480
I think the prow that you put tape to the front of your boat.

22:22.480 --> 22:22.960
Hold on.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.040
You could have duct taped this girl to your boat.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.800
You could have fucked this girl on a boat,

22:28.800 --> 22:30.160
and you didn't because you thought about

22:30.160 --> 22:33.360
how your dancing wasn't correct or some shit.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.960
It just makes me sick.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.480
Yeah, this could have been a person.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.200
You could have made love, and then the condom had an accident,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.880
and you could have had a person.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.240
And that person was, like, the next Martin Luther King Jr.

22:46.960 --> 22:50.640
Or, or it also could have been the next John Wayne Gacy.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.440
Oh, no.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Okay, it became a Paul Harvey story.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.120
He probably thought, what if I fuck this person,

22:57.120 --> 22:58.480
and then it's John Wayne Gacy?

22:58.480 --> 23:01.440
That comes out, not the person themselves.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.480
I think I would see that.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.960
Dude, dude is huge.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.960
Turns out to be John Wayne Gacy.

23:08.960 --> 23:09.600
I didn't notice.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.720
So foolish.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.400
You're wearing clown makeup.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.600
You're covered in kid blood.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.040
Let's continue this party under my basement.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.080
Can we not, John?

23:21.040 --> 23:22.000
The party's fun already.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.960
Can we just spend a night on the couch watching Netflix?

23:24.960 --> 23:27.360
The other thing that is important to remember

23:27.360 --> 23:31.040
that it is more negativity to cure your anxiety

23:31.040 --> 23:35.120
is that no one thinks about you ever.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.920
No one ever thinks about anybody other than themselves.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.000
If you're worried what people will think, don't.

23:40.000 --> 23:40.880
They don't.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.160
They're not thinking about you.

23:42.720 --> 23:43.280
They don't.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.320
They don't care.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.600
You're the only one that's caring,

23:45.600 --> 23:47.440
and you're caring more than everybody else.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.200
I would argue that in this situation,

23:50.080 --> 23:54.000
like, not doing it and being like, uh, uh, uh,

23:54.000 --> 23:58.160
is making her think less of you than if you just got out there

23:58.160 --> 23:59.280
and been a bad dancer.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.000
Because now she's thinking, like, what was the big deal?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.520
Why didn't that guy like me?

24:03.520 --> 24:05.760
Like, why is he being so weird?

24:05.760 --> 24:07.840
You made her feel bad about herself.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.840
She doesn't pick up a guy at a bar.

24:09.840 --> 24:13.440
They didn't make the baby that would ultimately save the world.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.600
This is what I measure things in now, by the way.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.280
I do love that it's only like a three or four step process.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.640
Yeah, that's right.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.560
And there are only two degrees of people.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.720
Either it's the next Gacy or the next King.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.640
It's one of those two?

24:27.920 --> 24:28.880
Always?

24:28.880 --> 24:29.600
Always.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.520
I think there actually was a Paul Harvey story

24:31.520 --> 24:34.640
about like an abortion clinic where it's like two women came in

24:34.640 --> 24:37.360
and one got an abortion and one didn't.

24:37.360 --> 24:40.560
And the one who got an abortion, her son was going to be Picasso.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.960
And the one who didn't, her son was Hitler.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.200
And that's the rest of the story.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.720
Paul Harvey was a fucked up guy.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.240
Man, Travis, that is the funniest bit you've ever done about abortion.

24:50.240 --> 24:54.480
You might have made your top five abortion bits.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.400
That is definitely the top five.

24:57.520 --> 24:58.400
That didn't come from me.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.600
That came from Paul Harvey.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.680
But it came from the Paul Harvey that doesn't exist in your fucking head.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.720
Via the transit of property, it came from you.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.320
It came from the Paul Harvey.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.000
It's so fucking stupid.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.760
He thinks that people who get aborted,

25:11.760 --> 25:14.320
we somehow can predict what they would have been.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.760
It was a what if.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.200
It was a what if, you guys.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.400
It was a what if.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.040
It was a what if story.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.040
Pop this abortion in the what if machine.

25:24.080 --> 25:27.120
And now you know the bullshit I made up.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.120
Okay, Paul.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.280
I'm Paul Harvey, drunk as fuck.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.680
Wouldn't it be crazy if, hey pass that bong over here.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.120
Wouldn't it be crazy if a woman had an abortion

25:39.120 --> 25:41.920
and her baby was like Jesus or some shit.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.120
Ah, that'd be weird.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.280
And now you know a fucked up thing.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.040
That I made up.

25:47.040 --> 25:51.200
Man, Paul, you have not lost a step in your old age.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.400
Even though you think that cucumber is a radio microphone,

25:54.400 --> 25:56.160
you have not lost a step.

25:57.200 --> 26:01.280
Paul Harvey, radio titan, full of shit.

26:02.880 --> 26:03.600
Maybe dead.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.160
Possibly dead, I'm not sure.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.040
Definitely on the run.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.840
Dead as Dan Loria wishes he was.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.480
Paul Harvey, total asshole.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.960
Abortion fetishist.

26:18.720 --> 26:19.200
Liar.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.800
Professional bullshitter.

26:22.800 --> 26:23.600
Paul Harvey.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.040
Real asshole.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.320
Paul Harvey.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.360
You wanna go to the money town?

26:29.360 --> 26:30.640
Yeah, try to stop me.

26:30.640 --> 26:42.880
Travis, how weird do you like it?

26:45.200 --> 26:48.480
Uh, you don't know.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.680
That's the problem.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.600
And it's a problem that we're all facing

26:51.600 --> 26:54.080
because we haven't gone to extrememachines.com

26:54.080 --> 27:00.640
and gotten ourselves some sex stuff for sex.

27:00.640 --> 27:03.360
Yes, but let me throw this out, Justin.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.240
I hate to derail your hilarious goof train,

27:06.800 --> 27:08.400
but what if it wasn't for sex?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.280
What if it wasn't for sex?

27:11.280 --> 27:15.520
We got, we got, we got a customer review,

27:15.520 --> 27:18.720
a confessional from a listener named Meg.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.840
She works for an artist at a video game company

27:21.840 --> 27:24.080
and they call other guys over to check their computers

27:24.080 --> 27:25.840
to review what they're working on.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.240
And sometimes haters are gonna hate

27:28.240 --> 27:29.520
and they just won't leave you alone.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.680
And so she brought a drill-a-hole fucking machine

27:33.680 --> 27:37.760
at a discounted price using the midlist coupon code.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.800
And that's what she uses to drive away haters.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.720
Oh, sorry, haters.

27:43.600 --> 27:44.480
Sorry, haters.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.760
I've got a fucking machine.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.720
Hey, HR?

27:47.440 --> 27:50.160
Hi, this is Griffin from the podcast.

27:50.160 --> 27:54.160
Did, there's some shit happening under your fucking nose

27:54.160 --> 27:56.160
that you let a fucking machine,

27:56.880 --> 27:59.680
you let a drilling fucking machine into your office

27:59.680 --> 28:01.200
and somebody is using it.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.960
They have weaponized it.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.840
She uses, she has a special carrying case

28:05.840 --> 28:07.600
that like she pops the latches on.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.920
I imagine at this point, like that's enough for them to go.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.600
High human resources.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.680
She made a holster for her fucking machine

28:13.680 --> 28:15.120
that she brings into work every day

28:15.120 --> 28:16.320
that you haven't noticed.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.520
So streamerchase.com is an adult superstore

28:19.520 --> 28:23.600
and a great place to pick up a plate thing to scare people

28:23.600 --> 28:24.960
that will probably get you fired.

28:24.960 --> 28:25.760
Mm-hmm.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.200
And you can get everything on the site 20% off

28:29.760 --> 28:32.800
using the coupon code MIDDLIST.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.400
That's right, MIDDLIST.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.440
They're running a special promotion right now on dildos

28:37.440 --> 28:39.120
where if you buy 10 dildos,

28:39.840 --> 28:44.880
then you're gonna feel great when you get all of that.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.920
Great when you get all those dildos in you.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.680
It's not a conventional promotion.

28:49.680 --> 28:56.240
Special, well put in the coupon code 10 dildos inside

28:56.240 --> 28:57.920
and then buy the 10 dildos.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.160
You're not gonna get any kind of discount on it.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.680
Only for the coupon code MIDDLIST.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.000
Just type in the coupon code quiverofdildos.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.880
If you can get all 10 dildos in you

29:07.600 --> 29:09.920
and you take a picture of yourself and you send it in,

29:10.640 --> 29:12.240
then they will have that of you.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.440
Not to us, not to us.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.160
Not to us.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.440
But for the love of sweet baby Jesus, not to us.

29:17.440 --> 29:17.680
Unless.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.160
If you craft yourself like a dildo bandolier

29:21.040 --> 29:23.840
and then use them to fight crime as like the dilder.

29:24.880 --> 29:25.520
The Dilbert.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.840
The Dilbert.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.880
That would just be awesome.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.320
Head to extrovertrace.com,

29:30.320 --> 29:34.080
use the coupon code MIDDLIST and get fucked.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.680
Hey folks, this is Kevin Allison of The State and the podcast RISK

29:39.680 --> 29:41.440
where people tell true stories

29:41.440 --> 29:43.280
they never thought they'd dare to share.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.800
X-rated stories.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.440
Outrageously hilarious stories.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.960
Tear-jerking stories.

29:48.960 --> 29:54.160
You won't believe how real and raw and surprising RISK can be.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.120
You've heard people say,

29:55.120 --> 29:56.560
oh, too much information.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.640
Don't be sharing that in mixed company.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.960
Well, at RISK, we say, screw that.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.080
Anything goes.

30:02.080 --> 30:05.840
So you've got a treasure trove of jaw-dropping entertainment

30:05.840 --> 30:07.200

30:07.200 --> 30:09.840
Look us up at maximumfun.org

30:09.840 --> 30:12.960
or of course just go to podcast at the iTunes store

30:12.960 --> 30:14.560
and search for RISK.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.200
This Yahoo is sent in by Jacob Locker.

30:21.200 --> 30:21.760
Thank you, Jacob.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user obesecatholic who asks,

30:27.200 --> 30:29.680
is it safe to let a horse live in my bathroom?

30:31.920 --> 30:32.320
That's it.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.360
Okay, well, depends on the size of the horse.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.520
Safe for you or safe for the horse?

30:39.520 --> 30:40.960
These are both great questions.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.440
What's your flooring situation?

30:43.440 --> 30:46.480
Is it a first floor bathroom or a second floor bathroom?

30:46.480 --> 30:51.520
Do you know any people who will ever come over to your house

30:51.520 --> 30:53.200
and use your bathroom?

30:53.200 --> 30:54.000
Not anymore.

30:54.000 --> 30:54.800
Because they-

30:56.000 --> 30:58.880
Because if you do, a pretty good goof would be to pretend

30:58.880 --> 31:00.960
like there is no horse in that bathroom.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.160
A what?

31:02.160 --> 31:04.640
What did you see in my bathroom?

31:04.640 --> 31:05.680
Pardon me?

31:05.680 --> 31:06.160
No.

31:06.160 --> 31:06.960
Excuse me?

31:07.920 --> 31:10.000
That's my sacred space.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.920
That's where I store my 10 dildos.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.560
What exactly are you accusing me of, sir?

31:16.560 --> 31:16.880
Sir?

31:18.800 --> 31:23.680
That is my mother-in-law, sir.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.120
How dare you?

31:25.120 --> 31:26.160
How good day.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.160
You racist.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.560
I have to go feed her some oats to cheer her up.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.240
The shenanigans.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.840
The shenanigans that this situation would lead to.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.880
There are literally, if this podcast was six hours long,

31:40.880 --> 31:42.640
I couldn't enumerate them.

31:42.640 --> 31:45.520
There's so many possible shenanigans.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.800
He's gonna eat all your TP.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.240
Uh-huh.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.400
He's gonna use up all your hot water.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.240
Yeah.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.200
He's gonna shave-

31:53.200 --> 31:53.840
He's big.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.040
He's a big horse.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.360
He's gonna shave his face and then he's gonna have like

31:57.360 --> 32:02.880
a regular skin face and a hair body over the rest of him.

32:02.880 --> 32:06.160
He's also gonna get in the shower while you hide in the closet

32:06.160 --> 32:08.720
and do voiceover for him and make whoever's pooping

32:08.720 --> 32:09.680
think he's Mr. Ed.

32:12.400 --> 32:12.880
No?

32:12.880 --> 32:13.360
No.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.920
Why would they get, they wouldn't get, nobody would,

32:16.720 --> 32:20.800
nobody would, in this situation, nobody would poop around the horse.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.360
Nobody would walk into the bathroom and be like,

32:23.360 --> 32:24.240
oh, a horse, huh?

32:24.240 --> 32:28.960
Well, if there's one thing I like, it's being seated and pantless

32:28.960 --> 32:33.440
around a giant 400 pound monster with chitinous feet.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.840
The horse is in the shower with a shower curtain drawn

32:35.840 --> 32:36.320
and the water is on.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.120
There's no reason.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.320
There is no reason.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.960
The person comes in and says, oh, sorry, I didn't know someone

32:40.960 --> 32:42.320
was in here, I was just gonna use the bathroom.

32:42.320 --> 32:45.280
And you voiceover and go, oh, yes, of course, use the bathroom.

32:45.280 --> 32:45.600
But you are-

32:45.600 --> 32:48.240
And then when the horse takes his head through the curtain,

32:48.240 --> 32:50.560
you're like, oh, I see that you're shitting.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.680
Travis, I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you,

32:53.680 --> 32:55.680
but you're being a real part of Harvey right now.

32:56.880 --> 33:02.000
I can't imagine any scenario in which you could lure a horse

33:02.000 --> 33:05.440
you could lure a horse, a full grown horse,

33:05.440 --> 33:07.520
unless we're talking like a little spasticity situation,

33:08.400 --> 33:10.240
a full grown horse into your bathtub.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.360
It is not happening.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.000
More importantly-

33:12.000 --> 33:13.120
What if you had a carrot?

33:13.120 --> 33:17.760
Okay, no, listen, listen, they're not discrete creatures.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.640
They are not God's most, they're God's most beautiful

33:20.640 --> 33:22.960
and they're God's most brilliant and soulful creatures.

33:22.960 --> 33:23.840
And killable.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.120
They're most killable.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.560
Most destroyable creature.

33:26.560 --> 33:31.040
Yes, but they are not what you might call stealth.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.640
They are not stealth animals.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.160
God made it so they can't sneak up on you.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.560
So what you're saying is you need a really opaque shower curtain.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.200
He gave them-

33:41.200 --> 33:42.240
Oh God, Travis.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.960
He gave them percussion on their fucking feet.

33:44.960 --> 33:45.760
You're gonna hear them.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.520
You gotta put down the little rubber fishes

33:47.520 --> 33:49.120
so they don't slide all over the place.

33:49.120 --> 33:52.080
Nobody has ever, nobody's ever walked into a barn

33:52.080 --> 33:54.160
and been surprised by a horse's presence.

33:55.120 --> 33:55.920
Turn the corner and be like,

33:55.920 --> 33:58.240
oh my God, I didn't know a horse was in here.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.880
Travis, do you know what they call a ninja that rides a horse?

34:00.880 --> 34:01.360
What's that?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.080
A corpse.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.760
Cause they can't sneak at all.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.280
Cause it's really dark, Justin.

34:07.280 --> 34:07.520
Yeah.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.280
Sorry, ninjas.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.720
You took a really dark place.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.160
Our whole ninja contingent is gonna-

34:12.160 --> 34:14.400
Sorry, anybody who's listening and also a ninja.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.560
I didn't mean to be such a Paul Harvey.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.440
Might be fun though.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.480
Dress them up in a little suit.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.720
For like a day, it would be the best.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.440
That's the thing, it would be great for like 10 minutes.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.000
Or another good goof if somebody comes over for dinner

34:30.000 --> 34:32.960
and they're like, holy shit, there's a horse in your bathroom.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.880
And you go, oh shit, he escaped from the kitchen.

34:38.880 --> 34:42.320
The worst thing about having a horse in your bathroom

34:42.320 --> 34:45.840
is that you are gonna be desperate for somebody to see that shit.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.240
And from the moment they come over to visit,

34:48.240 --> 34:49.600
you're gonna be looking at them like,

34:49.600 --> 34:52.320
oh, how's your bladder feeling a bit full?

34:53.360 --> 34:56.080
Do you want some coffee and bran?

34:56.080 --> 35:00.320
Did you need to poopy?

35:00.320 --> 35:01.440
You need to make dirt?

35:01.440 --> 35:04.080
Hey, hey, you need to make dirt?

35:04.080 --> 35:06.240
You're a little bloated, you need to make dirt?

35:06.240 --> 35:07.360
You need to make dirt?

35:07.360 --> 35:08.400
Go make some dirt.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.400
No, not down here, upstairs.

35:12.400 --> 35:15.600
Why would you put the horse in the upstairs bathroom?

35:15.600 --> 35:16.080
And not the downstairs?

35:16.080 --> 35:17.920
Because I only have a half bath downstairs

35:17.920 --> 35:20.480
and there's no goddamn way I'm getting the horse in there.

35:20.480 --> 35:20.980
Okay.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.320
Come on, Griffin.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.200
Come on.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.640
You've been in Justin's house.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.440
Use your brain.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.640
That goof is also on a time limit.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.080
You need to get them in the toilet.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.680
That horse is gonna give you maybe five minutes of silence.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.680
If you slop some peanut butter in its jaws,

35:39.680 --> 35:43.040
and if you take him on a long, beautiful ride

35:43.040 --> 35:46.240
for several hours in the countryside, getting real worn out,

35:46.240 --> 35:48.080
maybe he'll stand still for you for five minutes.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.600
But after that, all bets are off.

35:49.600 --> 35:55.120
Horses, horses are noted assholes

35:55.120 --> 35:58.640
and they like to feel majestic at least,

35:58.640 --> 36:01.120
at least three times an hour.

36:01.120 --> 36:04.320
So if you go for too long without making them feel

36:04.320 --> 36:07.440
or look majestic, they're just gonna start whining

36:07.440 --> 36:08.880
and then the goof's over.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.280
And then you're a weird guy in the horse's bathroom,

36:11.280 --> 36:13.760
not the prankster supreme 2013.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.000
But if you can pull it off.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.120
Oh God, if you can pull it off

36:21.840 --> 36:24.160
and take a picture and send it into us,

36:24.160 --> 36:28.240
we will give you the title of goof master supreme 2013.

36:29.680 --> 36:30.880
We will give that to you.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.960
We'll send it with a big novelty check

36:32.960 --> 36:34.720
for as much money as you want.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.600
The check means nothing.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.200
The check will be worth money.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.080
This is what I'm saying.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.160
If you can pull it off, you can have everything.

36:43.040 --> 36:43.920
You can have the check.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.760
The world is yours.

36:45.760 --> 36:46.640
The hat.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.680
Oh, there's a hat.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.240
Listen, do not take it to a photo shop

36:50.240 --> 36:51.760
and have it photo shopped

36:51.760 --> 36:52.640
because I will know the difference.

36:52.640 --> 36:55.200
If you take a picture of a horse in a photo shop,

36:55.200 --> 36:56.240
that would be awesome.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.400
I will also accept horse in a photo shop,

36:59.440 --> 37:01.600
but I have to know that it's original for us.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.160
The horse has to be saying my brother, my brother and me

37:04.160 --> 37:04.800
or making his mouth.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.080
And holding today's paper.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.680
And holding today's paper in his,

37:07.680 --> 37:10.240
no, he's holding tomorrow's paper in his mouth.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.160
And we've got an early edition.

37:12.160 --> 37:17.840
I love it.

37:17.840 --> 37:18.880
Oh, man.

37:18.880 --> 37:20.400
You guys want another question here?

37:20.400 --> 37:23.200
Yeah, I'm 20 years old.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.920
And while I'm fortunate to have my parents pay my tuition,

37:25.920 --> 37:27.440
something I'm very grateful for,

37:27.440 --> 37:29.520
I try not to rely on their financial assistance

37:29.520 --> 37:30.720
as much as possible.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.080
I just got a text from my dad saying

37:32.080 --> 37:33.600
he put a hundred dollars in my bank account

37:33.600 --> 37:35.040
as a gift for a rainy day.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.960
A hundo is nice.

37:37.520 --> 37:38.800
Feel bad for taking the money.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.720
Should I just give him the money back?

37:40.720 --> 37:42.240
As I step towards independence?

37:42.240 --> 37:44.480
Or should I take the gift and go with it?

37:44.480 --> 37:47.120
That's from Mr. Wants to be independent.

37:47.120 --> 37:47.920
That's so cute.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.560
That's so nice.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.280
It's really nice.

37:52.320 --> 37:52.800
Just take it.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.520
What are you?

37:53.520 --> 37:55.120
Take your dad's fucking money.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.480
Take your dad's fucking money.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.720
He earned it and it makes him happy to give it to you.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.080
If you were 46 and your dad dropped a hundo on you,

38:02.080 --> 38:05.360
I see you going, hey, dad, you're in a home.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.280
Please don't give me your money anymore.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.680
I'm literally paying for all of your care.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.320
This is coming directly out of my account.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.160
You take that money.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.200
Just take the money.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.200
Your dad is trying to do something nice.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.120
Don't worry about it.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.000
Trust me.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.480
He'll get sick of giving you money soon enough.

38:22.480 --> 38:24.000
So soon.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.800
So soon.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.800
Squirrel it away.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.520
Do you like have a, do you have a job?

38:33.280 --> 38:36.240
Here's my opinion, guys, and this is just for me.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.040
I think if your parents are paying the bulk of your expenses,

38:39.040 --> 38:45.840
I think, I think that like trying to strike out on your own is, is noble.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.040
And I think that trying to secure your independence can be really great for

38:49.040 --> 38:49.920
your confidence.

38:49.920 --> 38:54.480
But like, if your parents are already paying the bulk of your expenses,

38:54.480 --> 38:58.080
like that, you know, it's a, it's a futile gesture.

38:58.080 --> 38:58.560
Yeah.

38:58.560 --> 38:59.120
Yeah.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.240
It's a pure victory.

39:00.240 --> 39:04.000
If you're like, no, I won't take your Benjamin, like, just, just take it and

39:04.000 --> 39:06.560
then get yourself on your own two feet as soon as you can.

39:06.560 --> 39:10.160
And also, I mean, helpful advice.

39:10.160 --> 39:15.040
There's a big difference between having to ask your dad for money to pay for

39:15.040 --> 39:18.800
something and your dad just being like, Hey, because I love you.

39:18.800 --> 39:19.760
Here's the present.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.720
That's your, that's you've been a good sign.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.720
You've been a good son.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.560
This is your good son reward.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.440
Just take it and go buy some Pokemon cards or some shit.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.960
There is nothing that there's nothing unindependent.

39:32.960 --> 39:33.920
There's no dependent.

39:33.920 --> 39:34.960
That's what I'm looking for.

39:34.960 --> 39:38.080
There's nothing dependent about someone giving you a present.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.080
Yeah.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.680
I mean, it's just nice.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.240
Yeah.

39:42.240 --> 39:42.880
Don't worry about it.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.600
It's not a big deal.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.280
That was easy.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.080
Next one.

39:46.080 --> 39:46.960
That's easy.

39:46.960 --> 39:47.920
Here's more advice.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.080
I just moved into a new apartment building.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.200
I'm loving everything about the upgrade in space compared to my last place.

39:53.840 --> 39:57.680
However, my next door neighbors have started ruining my excitement by playing

39:57.680 --> 39:59.280
their music TV all day, every day.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.080
Now here's the thing.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.960
They aren't blasting it by any means.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.600
But the bass is audible enough to hear in my apartment.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.880
It makes watching quiet movies hilarious because it's hard to appreciate a

40:08.880 --> 40:15.360
haunting scene where Philip Seymour Huffman with a quiet in the background.

40:15.360 --> 40:19.120
I can usually jot it out by playing my TV and music, but then I risk annoying

40:19.120 --> 40:20.960
my downstairs upstairs neighbors.

40:21.520 --> 40:26.400
The short version, my right to be so annoyed with this barely noticeable noise.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.160
Or am I just a premium rush?

40:28.160 --> 40:29.520
That's from IRAE in Illinois.

40:29.520 --> 40:34.320
I would, I would argue that it is more annoying to have it barely audible.

40:34.320 --> 40:34.880
Oh my God.

40:34.880 --> 40:35.120
Yes.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.240
It's super.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.280
Right, right.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.240
Absolutely.

40:38.240 --> 40:42.800
Okay, no, because if it's super blasting, you can roll next door and be like,

40:42.800 --> 40:44.160
Hey, turn it down.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.160
Well, can you, can you Superman?

40:48.160 --> 40:49.840
Is that something you're big, tough, Jeannie?

40:50.560 --> 40:51.760
Is that something you're capable of doing?

40:51.760 --> 40:52.320
Luke Kang?

40:53.040 --> 40:54.160
I did not know.

40:54.160 --> 40:54.800
I did not know.

40:54.800 --> 40:55.360
I was brothers.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.240
It was a superhero.

40:56.240 --> 40:57.040
I did not know.

40:57.040 --> 40:57.680
I did not know.

40:57.680 --> 40:58.320
I did not know.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.840
I was brothers. It was a superhero.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.480
Turn it down.

41:03.200 --> 41:07.360
Are you implying that politely asking your neighbors to turn something down is such a

41:07.360 --> 41:10.960
scary experience that only Luke Kang could accomplish it?

41:10.960 --> 41:17.840
I'm saying to have the bravery to, to confront anybody for any reason.

41:23.600 --> 41:23.920
Okay.

41:23.920 --> 41:24.400
You know what?

41:24.400 --> 41:27.920
I'm laughing and I'm making fun of you, but you're absolutely correct.

41:27.920 --> 41:32.080
I think whenever something like that happens, everybody instantly turns into Charlie Brown

41:32.080 --> 41:34.160
and goes, I'll wait.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.200
I'm sure it'll be fine.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.400
They'll move eventually.

41:38.400 --> 41:43.600
That might just be because the three of us have the kind of type J personalities that

41:43.600 --> 41:45.360
never help you get along in the world.

41:46.800 --> 41:50.720
The number of times in my life that I say things like, you know, I should go say something.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.440
I mean, I'm not going to, but I recognize that I should.

41:53.440 --> 41:57.120
This is one of those moments where if I had a dick, if I-

41:57.120 --> 41:59.040
I would definitely use it.

42:01.360 --> 42:05.040
You guys should get in Sydney as a wife because boy, howdy.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.720
She does not suffer that.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.760
We were in a, we were in, used to stay at that apartment.

42:09.760 --> 42:14.080
You guys remember that apartment that she used to be in on 6th Avenue next to Marshall?

42:14.080 --> 42:14.320
Yeah.

42:14.320 --> 42:24.560
We were there and her downstairs neighbors, like, took this to its logical extreme and

42:24.560 --> 42:31.360
did the most insufferable thing in the world, which is to, at all hours, especially like

42:31.360 --> 42:32.720
2 to 3 a.m.

42:32.720 --> 42:37.200
See, we really choice, would blast Sublime's Santeria.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.720
Oh, that's a good one though.

42:38.720 --> 42:39.920
Definitely volume.

42:39.920 --> 42:40.960
On loop?

42:40.960 --> 42:41.680
Yes, yes.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.400
Like, oh my god, they're listening to fucking Santeria.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.240
I'm getting to the deepest levels of it.

42:46.240 --> 42:46.960
Play it again.

42:46.960 --> 42:47.600
She would just-

42:47.600 --> 42:48.320
I'm hearing it.

42:48.320 --> 42:53.120
She would just get on our hands and knees with this cast iron pan that we bought.

42:53.120 --> 42:56.880
It was the first thing we ever bought together, actually, and she would just pound on the

42:56.880 --> 42:58.080
floor with it.

42:58.080 --> 43:01.280
And then one night she just eventually got sick of it and went downstairs and started

43:01.280 --> 43:05.920
banging on their door with a cast iron skillet and told them to turn off the goddamn Santeria

43:05.920 --> 43:09.520
because it was the only song they listened to with Santeria constantly.

43:09.520 --> 43:14.240
And now you guys can't make love unless you listen to Santeria by Sublime.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.320
Totally weird, totally weird, totally true.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Hey man, we're all right there with you.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.080
Yeah, listen, this is no Paul Harvey stuff.

43:22.080 --> 43:22.720
This is real.

43:22.720 --> 43:23.600
No, this is real.

43:24.400 --> 43:29.440
I have upstairs neighbors that, I swear to god, they've got kids that are like five and

43:29.440 --> 43:32.240
six at like three o'clock in the morning.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.680
Those kids are running in circles.

43:34.720 --> 43:35.760
I don't understand it.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.120
It blows me away.

43:37.120 --> 43:41.280
And like, it will wake me up, but not enough to tell them.

43:41.280 --> 43:44.160
My fucking backyard John Hammond, I wish you would make a noise.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.520
I wish I knew what that fucking dude was doing back there ever.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.280
I'm getting one clue.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.120
Give me one thing.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.200
Give me one thing, dog.

43:53.200 --> 43:58.160
If I heard like a weird like full brass klezmer band coming from there, I'd be like, oh, okay.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.640
So he's like just some sort of weird klezmer guy.

44:00.640 --> 44:01.840
But it's not that.

44:01.840 --> 44:02.560
It's not that.

44:03.120 --> 44:05.760
I can't fucking crack that nut and it's killing me.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.520
You're not going to know until it's too late.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.400
You know that, right?

44:08.400 --> 44:09.680
You accepted that?

44:09.680 --> 44:10.480
Oh, yeah.

44:10.480 --> 44:10.960
Yeah.

44:10.960 --> 44:15.280
The only noise I'm going to hear is the chainsaw that he's ripping through my spine.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.840
That is the first sound from him I will ever hear.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.960
You're going to have time to think, is that piano wire?

44:20.960 --> 44:23.040
And then your air is gone.

44:23.600 --> 44:24.640
You're blacking out.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.160
You're done.

44:26.160 --> 44:26.880
Oh, man.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.920
You got another Yahoo Griffin?

44:29.920 --> 44:31.840
I mean, is that where we should go now?

44:33.680 --> 44:35.200
Yeah, we can take it here.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.040
This Yahoo was sent by Joe Ruscio.

44:37.040 --> 44:37.600
Thank you, Joe.

44:38.800 --> 44:43.680
It's by Yahoo answer user R who asks, is it cool so see a boy sagging their pants?

44:43.680 --> 44:47.520
Whoa, if you like it, what type of underwear should it be and how low?

44:47.520 --> 44:48.560
If you don't like it, why?

44:50.560 --> 44:53.520
I'm sorry, I need the thesis statement one more time.

44:53.520 --> 44:56.320
Is it cool so see a boy sagging their pants?

44:56.320 --> 45:00.720
Okay, is it cool to see a boy sagging their pants?

45:00.720 --> 45:07.440
Which is great because it's not asking if it's cool to sag because the answer is of

45:07.440 --> 45:09.280
course, still and forever.

45:09.280 --> 45:12.480
Is she asking like a bird watching question?

45:12.480 --> 45:14.160
I saw another one today.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.120
It's a good omen.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.160
Make a wish.

45:16.160 --> 45:20.720
It's like the cowboy on the Tootsie Roll Pop wrapper.

45:20.720 --> 45:24.400
But what you don't want is a boy sagging his pants to like be outside your window because

45:24.400 --> 45:26.000
then someone in the house is going to die.

45:26.000 --> 45:26.560
That's true.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.680
Shh, look at the front of the bed.

45:30.800 --> 45:31.520
Shh, look at the front of the bed.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.800
It's a boy sagging his pants.

45:33.760 --> 45:39.760
When I sag, I just go commando.

45:39.760 --> 45:40.400
Okay.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.680
Which is not a thing.

45:41.680 --> 45:44.640
So you just have your balls out.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.840
I have my butt and half of one ball out.

45:49.200 --> 45:52.160
And it's not a popular thing at the mall to do.

45:52.880 --> 45:53.120
No.

45:55.600 --> 46:00.400
What I do is I sag my pants and then I have another pair of pants underneath and it looks

46:00.400 --> 46:01.600
like my pants are molting.

46:05.600 --> 46:06.160
Shitting.

46:06.960 --> 46:10.000
And sometimes you wear snakeskin pants which really heightens the effect.

46:10.000 --> 46:10.880
Mm hmm.

46:10.880 --> 46:16.400
I think the best time I ever saw a boy sagging his pants was when I was watching Three Stooges.

46:16.400 --> 46:20.400
And this in the movie.

46:21.120 --> 46:24.000
Are you talking about Larry or Moe or Curly?

46:24.000 --> 46:25.040
In the hit film.

46:25.040 --> 46:32.720
In the hit film, they see someone, Larry or Moe, Curly, see someone's pants sagging as

46:32.720 --> 46:34.080
an African-American gentleman.

46:34.640 --> 46:37.440
And he says, Hey, buddy, let me help you.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.200
Your pants are falling down.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.640
And then he pulls them up.

46:40.640 --> 46:43.120
And I thought, it's 2012.

46:43.120 --> 46:46.000
You also thought this is the most racist thing I've ever heard.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.120
This is really crazy.

46:47.120 --> 46:47.840
This is really wild.

46:47.840 --> 46:50.560
You also thought, why can't I stop masturbating?

46:50.560 --> 46:54.720
I also thought, why is it 2013 and I'm watching this movie for a second time?

46:54.720 --> 46:56.560
That is another thing I thought last Saturday.

46:57.680 --> 46:58.800
One of the other thoughts I had.

46:58.800 --> 47:04.560
And then I thought, this joke is still pretty racist and not a joke really so much.

47:04.560 --> 47:09.600
So the only thing that happens, and if we may tangent into this, in the movie, the joke.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.160
A tangent?

47:11.920 --> 47:13.760
Okay, a logical step.

47:15.360 --> 47:21.920
The joke is just referencing that the young man is sagging his pants and Moe doesn't realize

47:21.920 --> 47:24.240
that it's been a cultural thing for like 30 years.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.200
Right.

47:25.200 --> 47:26.320
Attempts to pull them up.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.080
That's the punchline?

47:28.080 --> 47:28.320
Yeah.

47:29.040 --> 47:29.520
Cool.

47:29.520 --> 47:37.120
Is it possible for us to continue this bit without sounding like the script of Old Dogs?

47:37.120 --> 47:41.280
Is it possible for us to get out of this episode without sounding like three Tim Allens?

47:41.280 --> 47:46.400
Travis, are there any other bits in Three Stooges you'd like me to clear up for you?

47:46.400 --> 47:47.920
I still haven't seen the movie.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.760
So it's like hearing tales from a foreign land.

47:49.760 --> 47:52.400
You still haven't seen Three Stooges?

47:52.400 --> 47:53.520
It is on my bucket list.

47:53.520 --> 47:55.440
Didn't you want to get ready for the Oscars?

47:55.440 --> 47:59.440
The best sound mixing I think was on there.

47:59.440 --> 48:00.160
Yeah.

48:00.160 --> 48:00.960
Best yucking?

48:03.680 --> 48:04.480
Oh, God.

48:04.480 --> 48:07.200
Did you guys think the In Memoriam was lame?

48:07.200 --> 48:09.280
I think the In Memoriam was kind of lame this year.

48:09.280 --> 48:10.000
You guys think so?

48:11.040 --> 48:11.840
I don't know who died.

48:11.840 --> 48:13.360
Not a lot of like good people died.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.280
A lot of Beast Trainers.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.240
A lot of Beast Trainers.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.400
A lot of cinematographers, a lot of...

48:18.400 --> 48:18.560
Yeah.

48:20.640 --> 48:23.920
Do we all disagree to make a commitment to have more awesome people die this year?

48:23.920 --> 48:26.720
Just can we get some good people to die this year?

48:26.720 --> 48:29.680
Listen, I'm not saying anything wink nudge,

48:29.680 --> 48:33.440
but I'm just saying I'd like a really blockbuster In Memoriam this year.

48:35.040 --> 48:38.080
I mean, we could talk to them about adding people that haven't died yet.

48:38.080 --> 48:38.560
Uh-huh.

48:38.560 --> 48:41.200
How fucking crazy would that be?

48:42.560 --> 48:45.760
Fucking Mickey Rourke up on the screen like in the audience.

48:45.760 --> 48:48.320
And then cut to Mickey Rourke going, what?

48:48.320 --> 48:48.880
No.

48:48.880 --> 48:49.760
No, I'm here.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.480
Can't you see me?

48:52.480 --> 48:55.280
Can't anyone see me?

48:55.280 --> 48:58.240
The whole night's about trying to convince Mickey Rourke that he's a ghost.

49:00.880 --> 49:02.240
I'd watch those Oscars.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.320
What's happening to me?

49:06.320 --> 49:08.720
And then like the only person that can see him is Bruce Willis,

49:08.720 --> 49:10.240
and he just shits his pants.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.000
By the end of the night, James Cameron's like,

49:12.000 --> 49:14.560
thank you for this Oscar for Avatar 2.

49:14.560 --> 49:18.480
He's jumping up and down behind him, waving his hands.

49:18.480 --> 49:24.400
Please, someone, if you can see me, call somebody.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.840
I'm not ready to go.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.120
I'm not ready to go yet.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.560
I have so much left to do.

49:28.560 --> 49:31.200
At least turn me into a snowman like in Jack Frost.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.920
I need to tell my son I love him.

49:33.920 --> 49:34.720
I need to tell my son I love him.

49:34.720 --> 49:37.680
Like the documentary Jack Frost that I saw.

49:38.400 --> 49:41.360
Please, if anyone knows a voodoo priestess, please.

49:41.360 --> 49:45.040
I promise to be a good Jack Frost, like the killer kind,

49:45.040 --> 49:47.280
the killer one Jack Frost movie.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.040
Snowman, killer, good snowman.

49:51.040 --> 49:51.600
I'm done.

49:52.160 --> 49:52.640
I quit.

49:52.640 --> 49:53.760
I gotta go back to work, guys.

49:53.760 --> 49:54.880
I'm done with this podcast.

49:55.440 --> 49:56.160
Okay.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.360
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

49:57.360 --> 50:00.960
Made it to the advice show for the modern era where we do it.

50:00.960 --> 50:01.440
You heard it.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.160
You know we do.

50:03.360 --> 50:04.160
You know how we do.

50:04.160 --> 50:04.960
You know how we do.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.360
Thank you for everybody tweeting about the show.

50:08.080 --> 50:11.520
Unless you tweeted to ask where the show was today,

50:11.520 --> 50:13.040
because that really gets on my nerves.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.640
I'm glad you like it, but come on.

50:14.640 --> 50:18.000
Hey, dog, you can't rush perfection.

50:18.000 --> 50:18.960
Can't rush it.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.840
For real, though, I've had a real bad poopy bug.

50:22.400 --> 50:25.200
Griffin has had, for real, my butt.

50:27.360 --> 50:28.560
Griffin's butt fell off.

50:28.560 --> 50:32.800
I've had the worst poopy butt like for a week now,

50:33.360 --> 50:36.000
and it was pretty touch and go there for a while.

50:36.640 --> 50:37.600
You were about to say that.

50:37.600 --> 50:40.960
By which he would touch something and then he would go in his face.

50:40.960 --> 50:44.000
Anytime my physical form touched anything.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.760
I had to be suspended in the air.

50:48.320 --> 50:50.240
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

50:50.240 --> 50:51.520
Thank you to Rachel.

So many people tweeting about the show.

51:10.880 --> 51:11.200
Thank you.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.800
Make sure if you tweet about it,

51:12.800 --> 51:19.440
you use the hashtag MBMBAM and you include our sample link.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.760
It's bit.ly forward slash.

51:21.760 --> 51:22.720
It's my bim bam.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.720
I want to say thank you to Jonathan Barnes,

51:25.840 --> 51:32.160
a friend of ours who works at Cosi and took me and Riley and Sydney

51:32.160 --> 51:34.160
on a sort of behind the scenes tour.

51:34.720 --> 51:35.840
Oh, that's so awesome.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.400
I know.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.280
It was so much fun.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.960
We got to do a show there sometime soon.

51:38.960 --> 51:39.440
I know, right?

51:39.440 --> 51:39.940
Columbus.

51:40.720 --> 51:41.520
So thank you to him.

51:41.520 --> 51:45.120
And and thank you to everybody sharing the show

51:45.120 --> 51:46.960
and getting other people interested.

51:46.960 --> 51:49.200
And be sure to check out all the other shows on Max Fun.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.120
At this point, you know all of them

51:51.120 --> 51:53.120
because I assume all of you are listening.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.520
But go to maximumfun.org and check it out.

51:55.520 --> 51:59.920
And while you're there, get the information on boatparty.biz.

51:59.920 --> 52:03.040
Jesus fucking Max Fun cruise.

52:04.640 --> 52:05.200
Drink it in.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.160
It's it's bananas.

52:08.160 --> 52:08.880
This cruise.

52:09.600 --> 52:10.640
It's going to be crazy.

52:10.640 --> 52:13.840
The Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival.

52:13.840 --> 52:14.640
Get there.

52:14.640 --> 52:18.560
I'm thinking about going because I just got over poopy butt.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.760
So I can't get it.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.520
I can't get the norovirus again.

52:22.800 --> 52:26.640
And the good thing is, since Mark McGrath canceled his cruise,

52:26.640 --> 52:31.520
they've just added Jen Blossoms and spin doctors to the Max Fun cruise.

52:32.160 --> 52:34.000
So it should be pretty fun.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.200
Did Mark McGrath cancel his cruise because he knew that people being on a boat

52:39.200 --> 52:43.120
and listening to Sugar Ray was like a diarrhea cocktail?

52:43.120 --> 52:46.000
He actually said, his direct quote was,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.240
the poop cruise did us no favors.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.760
Which is great because I bet the poop cruise would be like,

52:53.760 --> 52:56.400
the Sugar Ray cruise did nothing for us.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.280
Anyway, thanks.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.400
Griffin, you got a special thanks to John Roger Gright.

53:04.400 --> 53:05.680
That's usually what you say now.

53:05.680 --> 53:08.080
You usually say something about thanks to the Long Winters

53:08.080 --> 53:11.360
for letting us use their song as a departure from putting the days to bed.

53:11.360 --> 53:12.000
Go ahead.

53:12.000 --> 53:12.500
Do it.

53:13.760 --> 53:15.040
But you just did all of it.

53:15.040 --> 53:15.760
Was that the bit?

53:15.760 --> 53:16.260
Oh.

53:17.120 --> 53:19.040
So thank you for listening to our show.

53:19.040 --> 53:20.800
Make sure to join us again next Monday.

53:21.760 --> 53:23.920
Oh, if you want to have a shout out on the show,

53:23.920 --> 53:25.600
if it's like somebody's birthday,

53:25.600 --> 53:28.320
or if you just want to say congratulations to someone,

53:28.320 --> 53:32.400
or if you have a small business, or I guess a big business.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.560
I mean, we're not going to discriminate.

53:34.560 --> 53:38.880
Um, and you want to have us do a shout out for you in the money zone,

53:38.880 --> 53:42.880
just go to maximumfund.org forward slash Jumbotron.

53:42.880 --> 53:43.760
Get there.

53:43.760 --> 53:44.800
Griffin, take us out.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.800
I am ready.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.840
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Jacob Locker.

53:51.840 --> 53:52.720
Thank you, Jacob.

53:52.720 --> 53:56.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Catherine, who asks,

53:58.320 --> 54:00.880
opinions on the name pretzel for a girl?

54:00.880 --> 54:01.840
I'm Justin McElroy.

54:01.840 --> 54:02.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:02.960 --> 54:03.920
I'm pretzel.

54:04.480 --> 54:06.400
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.440
He's your dad.

54:07.440 --> 54:33.360
Square on the lips.
