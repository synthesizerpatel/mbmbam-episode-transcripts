00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.720
Hello everybody, and welcome to the one we're phoning in, because the Max Fun Drive is over,

00:50.720 --> 00:54.960
we got your money, and now we're just going to fuck them. These laurels are awful comfortable.

00:54.960 --> 01:01.360
Oh boy the laurels. We put out the best shows that we could. Still not good enough for some of you,

01:01.360 --> 01:07.520
that's fine. I hear you. I hear you. But you know what, we're doing our best right now.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.520
But not, no, no, sorry, sorry, sorry. We did our best. That was our best. We did our best.

01:11.520 --> 01:16.880
We're all out of best juice. I am giving a solid 63 percent.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.400
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me to Vice Show for the Magenera. I'm your oldest brother,

01:20.400 --> 01:24.400
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.760
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Now I did want to mention here at the top of the show

01:27.760 --> 01:31.520
that we, like sort of one of the things that we talk about during the Max Fun Drive is how your

01:31.520 --> 01:36.240
money has helped us expand, and to that point I'm really excited to announce a new project that I'm

01:36.240 --> 01:45.040
working on. It is a home improvement podcast, fan cast of the show Home Improvement. No,

01:45.600 --> 01:51.280
it's an actual, I improve a home. It's very specifically a specific room in that home,

01:51.280 --> 01:55.760
which is to say, and by room, I mean part of the, I'm talking about showers. I'm doing a new show

01:55.760 --> 02:01.520
and it's all about improving showers. And is it your own? Yeah. Where are you starting? Like what

02:01.520 --> 02:05.360
shower gets the first episode? You know that saying, don't shit where you eat?

02:06.320 --> 02:11.680
Yep. I'm shitting right in my, right on my dinner plate because I'm doing it right in my own master

02:11.680 --> 02:17.280
bath. You eat in your shower? I don't know if you hear that noise. That's my co-host on the show,

02:17.280 --> 02:22.000
Matthew. He's a new friend of mine that I just made this morning. But we're fast friends,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.200
brothers one might say. We're basically the new property brothers, but just friends. And

02:25.760 --> 02:32.240
technically he works for me right now. And so yeah, he's just in there banging away. And this

02:33.680 --> 02:39.120
is also technically, this is the first episode of Shower Boys, which is why I decided to call

02:39.120 --> 02:46.720
the podcast because it's just me and Matthew just like living it up. In the shower. I heard him

02:46.720 --> 02:52.480
weighing in on this just now. Yeah. He speaks mostly through Morse code as he bangs on pipes

02:52.480 --> 02:59.920
and tiles and stuff like that. Um, if Shower Boys doesn't work out and it won't, then we,

02:59.920 --> 03:04.480
I think we could pivot and do like a prank show where we just steal people's showers.

03:05.280 --> 03:09.840
You know what I mean? Maybe, or maybe like a, another funny prank might be you ruined the

03:09.840 --> 03:19.200
podcast that we do. Now how did I, how? Just like now. I mean, it's a good example now

03:19.840 --> 03:23.840
of how like you're ruining it now. Just because of the banging and the clanging and the clattering.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.800
Well, people like the, people like a sense of place, don't they? This is technically,

03:26.800 --> 03:30.640
this is some people's ASMR is pipe banging. You think people are triggered by the sound

03:30.640 --> 03:37.520
of tiles being destroyed? Oh yeah. He is really fucking them up. He's going hog. I think he

03:37.520 --> 03:41.360
actually, I think he maybe, I think he might actually be able to hear what I'm saying in here.

03:41.360 --> 03:46.560
And I think he's like trying to show what a big strong boy he is in the shower.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.720
Griffin is Matthew a big strong boy?

03:48.720 --> 03:52.880
He's a big boy. Yeah. He's a big strong lad. Um, he's in there doing it all by himself. He's like

03:52.880 --> 03:57.840
going to get that, that, that play out by himself is like, damn, damn, Matthew back at it again.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.200
Oh, uh, okay. So this is an advice show where

04:05.200 --> 04:09.840
about showers. This is the, remember it's both shows and also shower, but this is two podcasts

04:09.840 --> 04:15.360
together. Um, open, just take the left earbud out and you're going to hear shower boys in the right

04:15.360 --> 04:21.120
earbud. Now there's going to be a lot of crossover. Um, you actually don't want to take any of your

04:21.120 --> 04:26.960
earbuds out. You might miss, uh, um, here's just sort of a programming note about shower boys.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.520
Um, all right. I'm worried that I'm, I, if I'm going to be sort of the mouthpiece,

04:31.520 --> 04:36.960
like, I guess shower boys conceptually, as I've imagined it is I will sort of talk about like,

04:36.960 --> 04:40.800
what, what the shower is and like what my vision for it is while he does all the work. And then

04:41.440 --> 04:46.640
I don't think I'll have much to add in terms of like practically useful information. It's just,

04:46.640 --> 04:51.040
basically it's going to be me talking about what showers do while you hear banging and clattering

04:51.040 --> 04:56.240
in the background. Sounds great. Um, I actually have, do you think that would be a pretty good

04:56.240 --> 05:02.080
podcast? Just like interviewing people who have actual skills about how to apply those skills.

05:02.080 --> 05:07.040
Just like maybe it's just called like how grownups do it and just ask a grownup how they do it.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.400
He is just busting ass in there. He is kicking the shower. I've watched enough home improvement

05:12.400 --> 05:16.640
shows to know that you messed up by letting somebody else do the demo. Demo is the easy

05:16.640 --> 05:20.880
part. That's true. I actually have, I actually have Richard Carton in there too and he's keeping

05:20.880 --> 05:27.280
an eye on shit. You paid for a Carton appearance fee? No. Are you crazy? He was outside jogging

05:27.280 --> 05:30.560
and he needed to take a shit. And I was like, you can use my bathroom, but Matthew's in there. Can

05:30.560 --> 05:35.040
you keep an eye on stuff? And Carton's just been laid up on that toilet for like an hour and a half

05:35.040 --> 05:41.920
now. I walked in, I peaked my head in there just like make sure he had, you know, TP and stuff.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.120
Make sure he was doing okay. Make sure Matthew wasn't too uncomfortable with the whole situation.

05:45.120 --> 05:52.400
And, uh, uh, he was white as a, white as a sheet. Wait, Matthew was? Or Carton was? Both,

05:52.400 --> 05:57.040
both, but Carton whiter. I think a pretty good joke to do if you're Richard Carton

05:57.040 --> 06:02.160
is invite someone over to repair your shit and then just stand near them kind of like judgmentally.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.320
Like, well, not how I would have done it, but oh, you're a freak. I don't think so, Matthew.

06:06.320 --> 06:12.400
I'm not sure, Matthew. I have them locked in there. I should point that out too. Both. What?

06:12.400 --> 06:16.720
Both. I have both of them locked in the, in the toilet chamber. Oh, so do you think the

06:16.720 --> 06:22.480
banging is actually him trying to escape? Do you think the banging is him trying to kill Richard

06:22.480 --> 06:29.920
Carton? Like a mouse hunt situation where he just can't catch that rascally carn? God,

06:29.920 --> 06:35.680
how did Richard Carton get so tiny? I can tell you, I can tell you how he's been just based on

06:35.680 --> 06:44.640
like the time to like, um, mass exodus ratio. Like, um, he's, he's probably like dropped like a 120

06:44.640 --> 06:51.280
pounds in the John. Maybe that sound isn't like Matthew banging on tiles. It's just car and

06:51.280 --> 06:57.360
shitting in the toilet. Just dropping hammers. Listen, listen, I'm going to ask a question

06:57.360 --> 07:01.040
for advice. Okay. That's what this show's about. Hey, thank you everyone for max fun drive,

07:01.040 --> 07:07.920
by the way. It was really awesome. We love you. Yeah. You all killed it this year. It went so

07:07.920 --> 07:14.720
well. We're um, yeah, we're pleased as punch. Very pleased. I apologize. I genuinely do apologize

07:14.720 --> 07:18.400
that this work is happening behind me. It's either this or the show's late. So we thought

07:18.400 --> 07:26.800
this would be better. Um, so we're sorry. I will not stop thinking is hysterical that a man is

07:26.800 --> 07:32.720
hammering two feet from where you're making your show. I'm an adult woman with a job and stuff,

07:32.720 --> 07:38.800
but sometimes babysit for a family friend, uh, for arguably too much money. The family's great.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.920
I chill and play video games with the kids and their parents always tell me I can invite my

07:43.920 --> 07:49.280
boyfriend to join too. They don't know him super well, but he's cool. My question is this. If I

07:49.280 --> 07:54.720
bring him over to play video games and watch movies, do I have to split the cash with him?

07:54.720 --> 08:02.080
That's from confused caregiver in Canberra. Where's Canberra? Australia. I think. Okay.

08:02.080 --> 08:07.600
Pulled that right out. Wait. Yeah. You guessed that. Ask Matthew. It is in Australia. You

08:07.600 --> 08:15.200
fucking crushed it. No. So, um, uh, so it's the capital by the way. Good job guys. Thank you.

08:15.200 --> 08:21.600
Oh, I got it. Um, I here's, here's the way to solve this. He's over there. You're playing

08:21.600 --> 08:28.240
in what? Halo two with them on this, on these kids, first generation Xbox that they don't have.

08:28.880 --> 08:35.200
Um, and you're racking up sweet kills and stuff. Um, and then one of the kids, uh, you know,

08:35.200 --> 08:38.720
falls down a well, but just straight up baby Jessica's themself, like real good.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.680
While playing Halo? No, you you're distracted by, you know, getting,

08:43.680 --> 08:50.160
getting all the great scores and the, you know, the, you know, the stuff that happens in Halo

08:50.160 --> 09:00.800
and, uh, kid baby Jessica's died. And does the blame, does the blame get split equally between

09:00.800 --> 09:05.360
you and the boyfriend? Because if not, the money should not be split. Does that make sense?

09:06.880 --> 09:12.080
I mean, yeah. If something horrible happens, if something horrible happens to the children,

09:13.200 --> 09:18.000
then, and your boyfriend's over, but you're the babysitter. You're the one whose name is on the

09:18.000 --> 09:22.800
contract. Um, I feel like you're the one that's going to get in trouble. Like that's why they,

09:22.800 --> 09:26.880
that's, that's all a babysitter is. It's just like a person to carry the blame.

09:26.880 --> 09:33.920
I'm more confused as to why you jump to a child and not just like the kid gets sick and throws

09:33.920 --> 09:42.080
up. You jump to like baby Jessica well situation. I feel like that I'm more confused about why

09:42.080 --> 09:49.200
why that was your something bad that could happen. It's literally the worst thing that can happen.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.760
It's a really bad thing that can happen though. Because even the kid, like, like if the kid does,

09:53.760 --> 09:59.040
like the problem with the well is, okay, listen, babysitting scenarios, the kid eats poison.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.240
Ow, well, easy come, easy go. Kid falls in a well. The impetus is on you to get the kid out of the

10:04.240 --> 10:08.640
fucking well. Right? That's still a problem you can solve ostensibly. Yeah. That's a solve. That

10:08.640 --> 10:14.960
is a solvable problem. Like if you're babysitting my kid and the kid falls out well and I come home

10:14.960 --> 10:18.880
and the kid's still in the well, you're not getting a tip. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's fair.

10:18.880 --> 10:23.280
Why didn't you get the kid? That is fair. I just think, yeah, I think you don't split it. I think

10:23.280 --> 10:29.280
it's yours. This is your job. If I'm at Arby's and my, my wife comes to hang out with me at my,

10:29.280 --> 10:34.080
during my shift at Arby's, I don't give her a portion of my Arby's paycheck. I give her,

10:34.080 --> 10:39.920
you know, some curly fries and maybe a big fish sandwich. This is a, that's an excellent point.

10:39.920 --> 10:45.680
Like, is the boyfriend doing anything to help or is he just there? Is he doing burpees? Is he

10:45.680 --> 10:50.480
changing diapies? Is he, is he just guarding, is he just, is he guarding the well? Is he just

10:50.480 --> 10:56.400
standing at the ready at the well like a fucking goalie looking for like incoming kids? Because if

10:56.400 --> 11:02.800
he undertakes well guardianship, I feel like that's worth 20%. I think you need a flow chart

11:02.800 --> 11:10.320
of percentage of if he does this much, then he gets like a 10% like well guarding fee, right?

11:10.320 --> 11:17.680
If he changes one diaper, it's like 2% per diaper, right? And then you have just, you have like a

11:17.680 --> 11:22.560
star chart, kind of like he gets a little check marks and gold stars to determine how much of

11:22.560 --> 11:28.400
your sweet babysitting case he's going to get. Yeah. I don't think you can let him interact

11:28.400 --> 11:34.800
with the kids at all. Cause if he does that, if he helped like, if he helps one of them reach the

11:34.800 --> 11:40.560
cookie jar or God forbid teaches one of them a valuable life lesson, you're sunk. You have,

11:40.560 --> 11:45.120
that's a legal claim. If you see him turning a chair around to sit backwards on it, you get him

11:45.120 --> 11:50.400
out of the house. He's trying to get some of your money. Yeah, absolutely. What if he, what if he

11:50.400 --> 11:54.800
comes in, what if the boyfriend, you don't give the boyfriend any money though. You may want to

11:54.800 --> 11:58.720
fold him into the operation because what if you don't give him any money and then as you're

11:58.720 --> 12:04.880
leaving, he like looks at how much the parents gave you and he's like, listen, just friend to

12:04.880 --> 12:09.520
friend, you're really getting raped over the coals here. If you call Dylan's babysitting services,

12:09.520 --> 12:15.680
we will, we're going to cut you a very, very optimal rate. Friends and family. He undercut

12:15.680 --> 12:21.600
you. Yeah, he got undercutter. Let's, no, here's you, Susan, you stand over here. I'll stand right

12:21.600 --> 12:25.680
here. We'll let the kids decide. Which one do you want to come to? Oh, but then it turns out he's

12:25.680 --> 12:31.920
got a potty full of bacon. He's got, what? I was going to say fun size Snickers. But kids can't

12:31.920 --> 12:39.200
smell that. That's a good point. You mean something aromatic. You stink like Snickers, old man.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.480
Do you guys want to Yahoo? I smell the stink of Snickers on you. Please let me read this Yahoo.

12:45.040 --> 12:49.920
Okay. Okay. I'm being quiet. I don't, I feel like I'm being more quiet than I usually am.

12:49.920 --> 12:54.400
Just cause I'm. You don't want to wake up Matthew. Well, I don't want anybody. He's falling asleep

12:54.400 --> 12:58.320
while chiseling. He could be on Twitter right now. Just like putting up all the jokes as I say him.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.520
And this is a, this is a closed set. Um, a bunch of people sent this in, including a guy named

13:05.520 --> 13:08.800
Travis Pace. Thank you, Travis. This is by Yahoo Answers user. You're welcome. They're anonymous.

13:09.760 --> 13:18.000
Um, we're going to call them. There's something trending called dingus day. Oh, it's an actual day

13:18.000 --> 13:24.960
in. Okay. There's a day it's Easter Monday is called dingus day. And well, sorry guys. I got to

13:24.960 --> 13:28.880
take a break from the show and learn everything about dingus day. Dingus day celebrations are

13:28.880 --> 13:32.960
widespread and popular in Buffalo, New York, Wyandotte and Hamtrak in Michigan, South Bend

13:32.960 --> 13:37.920
and La Porte in Indiana and Hanover, New Hampshire. Give me a minute. There's something funny in here

13:37.920 --> 13:42.320
because it's called dingus day. Yeah. You feel like it almost has to have something.

13:42.320 --> 13:48.720
Then it just seems like second Easter they do a polka and they exchange eggs and they roll eggs

13:48.720 --> 13:53.120
and stuff, but they call it dingus day. That seems disrespectful. It's like good Friday

13:54.080 --> 13:58.720
and then Saturday and then Easter Sunday. And then you follow that up with those,

13:58.720 --> 14:03.520
that the high holy day with dingus day. It feels like it should be something like

14:03.520 --> 14:08.560
Mondo Monday or something like it's going to be awesome. And not like you're a real

14:08.560 --> 14:15.120
dingus day was created in Bible times and it was created to as an opportunity to make fun of the

14:15.120 --> 14:22.480
people who thought Jesus was down for the count. You just come around like, I told you, I try to

14:22.480 --> 14:26.160
tell you, I said, my boy was coming back and you're like, nah, nah, nah, but look at the stone.

14:26.160 --> 14:32.000
It done rolled away. Dingus. Give me an egg. Anyway, happy dingus day to everybody. Uh,

14:32.000 --> 14:39.440
this Yahoo was asked by dingus day, uh, brother to Morris day, uh, uh, dingus asks

14:41.520 --> 14:47.360
if I let a bee sting in on my male part, will it make it bigger? One more time.

14:47.920 --> 14:56.560
If I let a bee sting in on my male part. Oh, Matthew's loving this one. Will it make it bigger?

14:56.560 --> 15:04.400
I'm talking about his hog. If you get a bee sting up on there. Oh my. Are you going to get some

15:04.400 --> 15:14.320
extra shove meat? Yes, but not for permanent. So you're going to have to time it till just before

15:14.320 --> 15:19.360
the reveal. Travis, you didn't get that, but you didn't get that, but out fast enough. As soon as

15:19.360 --> 15:24.560
you said, yes, I let a bee sting me on my Johnson. But now Griffin, you're going to have to just keep

15:24.560 --> 15:31.680
having a bee sting you every hour. I don't know how long swelling lasts until the reveal and God

15:31.680 --> 15:36.960
help you. If you get a career in pornography, then it's like before every scene, like bringing the

15:36.960 --> 15:43.280
bees, you get a fluffer, you get a buzzer, the buzzer brings in the bee. I didn't know if that

15:43.280 --> 15:50.720
was clear. Um, I have a, I have an idea for a 300th episode celebration. Um, for a 300th,

15:50.720 --> 15:58.480
we mark this very auspicious occasion, uh, by going one episode without fucking talking about dicks.

15:58.480 --> 16:03.520
Like just one. If we could just do one where we don't talk about hogs or I don't know how to hear

16:03.520 --> 16:09.680
the phrase hog or Johnson or, or dick, just like one episode without dicks. What about, what if I,

16:09.680 --> 16:15.040
what if I call it, and this will be appropriate now because of the bees. If I call it my lumpo,

16:15.040 --> 16:24.320
I mean, I still, I'm still my lumpo bumpins. Hi, I'm Lumpo bumpins.

16:28.240 --> 16:36.880
Do you have an epi pen? I got to be honest. Uh, I, I don't like a lot of Ted Nugent tunes,

16:36.880 --> 16:44.240
but a Lumpo Bumbo is probably the one that I can groove to the most. Probably my favorite

16:44.240 --> 16:52.320
Ted Nugent song is Lumpo Bumbo by Ted Nugent. The delicious candy treat turned rocker.

16:53.120 --> 16:57.840
Yeah. It was his follow up to Cat Scratch Fever where he said, what other animal could inflict

16:57.840 --> 17:03.120
pain on you, but in a sexy way. I've got it. Bee saying my nail parts. Bumbo, Bumbo.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.480
I did that too loud. Now I'm embarrassed.

17:08.480 --> 17:15.200
Matthew knows too much. You can't let him leave. And then he was about to release a song and then

17:15.200 --> 17:19.600
he saw Striper in their uniforms. It's like, well, they've already got this bee like locked down.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.520
The whole bee thing is really there. They have a whole choir of Lumpo Bumpos.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.240
Where do they get the bees though? That's what I want to know. How do they,

17:28.240 --> 17:32.800
do they have a special compartment in the bus and their tour bus that all the bees sleep in?

17:32.800 --> 17:37.200
This is why, this is why all the bees are dying out. The answer is no, right? I mean,

17:37.200 --> 17:42.640
the answer is no. Yeah, Justin. I mean, it's just like Bugs Bunny cartoon

17:42.640 --> 17:48.720
where he gets stung on the hand and his hand swells up. Unless, unless.

17:50.480 --> 17:56.320
I mean, you get that, there's like that bees, that bee sting like lip gloss that was real hot

17:56.320 --> 18:00.400
in the nineties until it definitely probably killed some teens that you would put it on your

18:00.400 --> 18:05.520
lips and it would sting, but then your lips would get kissable, plump, kissable, plump, kissable

18:05.520 --> 18:10.800
Bumpos. So you want to plump up your bumper. I think if you're plumping those Bumpos, then

18:10.800 --> 18:15.440
you're, I think a bee sting would absolutely work. I don't think it is a, I don't think it's a great

18:15.440 --> 18:24.080
solution. I would be curious as to even if you did discover that the answer was a definitive yes.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.840
Bees are not the most sort of like tamable creatures. I mean, what are you going to

18:31.840 --> 18:36.720
rub some pollen on it? Like how do you train a bee to sting your dick? Well, you would have to

18:36.720 --> 18:42.960
make the bee feel threatened by your dick. By the way, because a bee sting, you does kill the bee.

18:43.600 --> 18:50.240
What a fucking, what a, what a pristine end that it, what a meaningful, what a meaningful death

18:50.240 --> 18:56.720
for that, for that poor bee. How did you go? Oh, good news. Bee St. Peter. Uh, I sting the dudes.

18:56.720 --> 19:03.200
What? St. Peter. St. Peter. Well, no, it would be, it would be the, the Hyena Net Cheerios bee is

19:03.200 --> 19:08.480
probably the first face you see in bee. I believe his name is Buzz. Okay. Well, great. Good work.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.880
It's not mine. I think his name actually is Buzz. No, I know. I'm saying shitty job, General Mills.

19:12.880 --> 19:20.240
It's very first thought. Who are the five bees you meet in heaven? I could only come up with like

19:20.240 --> 19:26.000
three. I mean, there's like Buzz and then all the stugs in a bee movie. The bee from The Simpsons,

19:26.000 --> 19:32.080
I guess, but he's a man in a bee costume. Yeah, I was gonna say the, the fly from, um, uh,

19:32.080 --> 19:38.080
Rescue Rangers, but he's a fly, of course. Zipper is a fly. Yeah, not explicitly, not a bee. But not

19:38.080 --> 19:43.360
a bee, but like, I'm just trying to think, why is there such under-representation of bees in the

19:43.360 --> 19:49.120
media? I mean, they made a bee, they made a bee movie. Most animals don't get like, hey everybody,

19:49.120 --> 19:54.240
it's an armadillo movie. No, we got a bee movie. No, because they cause leprosy. That's not true.

19:54.240 --> 20:01.040
I've got another question here. Uh, I cohabit, is that the word? Cohabit? Cohabit with my S.O.

20:01.040 --> 20:06.080
Her mother continually buys furniture items that are likely to be used by both of us. Bed frame,

20:06.080 --> 20:12.480
dresser, rugs, etc. While this is great on the one hand as I get new shit, I also abhor my mother-in-law's

20:12.480 --> 20:20.560
taste. All these items are gaudy and usually poorly made. The real trouble is that I try to

20:20.560 --> 20:25.040
politely say no, I don't feel like that fits our decor, but these things just keep showing up in

20:25.040 --> 20:29.920
my house. How do I get an in-law to stop buying me invitation Victorian shit when I'm more of an

20:29.920 --> 20:37.120
American craftsman kind of guy? That's from settling in Seattle. P.S., if it helps, my S.O. has no

20:37.120 --> 20:43.920
preference on one style versus the other. Uh, I'm confused because I, at first when I heard this I

20:43.920 --> 20:48.880
thought it was like she was gifting you this stuff because y'all like weren't getting your own stuff

20:48.880 --> 20:54.400
or you couldn't get your own stuff. In which case, I thought it was like a gift horse scenario.

20:54.400 --> 21:00.240
Whatever the next time, um, your mother-in-law, uh, brings over, uh, some furniture you say,

21:00.240 --> 21:05.360
oh, sweet firewood. And then she's like, what? And you're like, I said, oh, sweet firewood.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.480
And then you just sit in silence until she leaves the room. That's good. I called it, I called it

21:10.480 --> 21:17.280
kindling. Kindling. Thanks for the kindling mama. What if you, every time she brought you a new

21:17.280 --> 21:21.200
cabinet, you put an armament in it and you shut and locked it and you opened it up again and said,

21:21.200 --> 21:30.320
nope, not this one. I'm sorry, Griffin. I'm sorry to do this. It's the key. It's not the cabinet

21:30.320 --> 21:35.680
because later they use it on a trunk. They use it. So it's not, it's not cabinet specific.

21:36.640 --> 21:42.000
But as long as the mother-in-law doesn't know that. Yeah. Yeah, Travis. Obviously I know the secret

21:42.000 --> 21:49.280
of the magical source, the arcane source for Indian in the cupboard. Um, but I, I, I, you,

21:49.280 --> 21:53.440
you're just looking for a way to get rid of some old furniture. And I think this is a good one.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.840
Why'd you go, why you gotta put me on blast like that, Travis? You know, I'm in a

21:55.840 --> 22:00.720
vulnerable place right now. I just love you so much. Okay. Love you so much. I had to do it.

22:00.720 --> 22:05.600
I think that, uh, I, okay. I had a question as we were reading this question,

22:05.600 --> 22:11.840
which is you keep, you use the phrase S O. Are you using mother-in-law to literally describe

22:11.840 --> 22:17.680
someone who is now legally related to you? Or are you using it for shorthand of a significant

22:17.680 --> 22:25.360
other's mother? Like is she using it legally or casually? Yes. I've never met anybody who's used

22:25.360 --> 22:31.120
the word in-laws casually before. Well, see, I wouldn't think that either, except that they say

22:31.120 --> 22:38.720
S O rather than to just say like wife or husband or like partner or anything like that. Maybe it

22:38.720 --> 22:44.000
stands for superior officer and they're in the military. I have a new three step process for

22:44.000 --> 22:50.160
this. Uh, for, for questions like this, it goes like this. Are you going to say shit? This is a,

22:50.160 --> 22:56.080
this is a flow chart. Okay. Are you going to say shit? If yes, the problem is solved. If no,

22:56.080 --> 23:00.880
go to step two, step two, fucking learn to live with it, my man. Cause that's it. That's all you

23:00.880 --> 23:05.680
got. I thought you said there were three steps. Yes. There's, well, it's a three step flow chart.

23:05.680 --> 23:09.920
So there's three questions. It doesn't fucking matter. Listen, either say something or tough it

23:09.920 --> 23:14.720
up. You got furniture. Okay. This is, this is not that big of a problem. Just put your drinks on it.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.680
You know, look at, look at this way. If she's not worried about your taste,

23:17.680 --> 23:21.120
you shouldn't be worried about whether or not you have to use the stuff she sends you.

23:21.120 --> 23:27.360
So we have a segment on shower boys and it's all about sort of like rehab addicts. You know,

23:27.360 --> 23:32.320
the show rehab addicts. You know, I think that's kind of a fucked up name for a show. Don't you

23:32.320 --> 23:36.800
think? Anyway, you know, is there, they rehab furniture and then breathe new life into it.

23:36.800 --> 23:40.880
Oh. So we'll do like just sort of a sample episode right now. I thought that was a completely

23:40.880 --> 23:45.520
different thing. We'll do a sample episode right now. One of you guys be this person.

23:45.520 --> 23:50.160
I've got all this furniture. What do I do? Oh, let me see it. Oh, this is good stuff. What is this?

23:50.800 --> 23:55.120
Is this imitation Victorian? I love the, I love the woodwork, but you say you're not a fan of it.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.960
Yeah. I'm not a fan of it. I don't like it. It offends my sensibilities.

23:59.600 --> 24:05.600
Okay. Here's like a bunch of stickers. Here's like a bunch of stickers. I got some of these

24:05.600 --> 24:12.080
out of the official PlayStation magazine and a lot of these are bumper stickers I got from

24:12.080 --> 24:15.760
the library. And then- Is this a Garbage Pail Kids sheet?

24:16.560 --> 24:19.920
Yeah, it's a sheet of vintage Garbage Pail Kids. And I'm going to need you to actually reimburse

24:19.920 --> 24:26.240
me for that. I got those for $200. Can I just stick the outline sticker part on it and you

24:26.240 --> 24:30.880
keep the actual stickers? Yeah. I want you to ruin it without using it. That's absolutely what I want

24:30.880 --> 24:39.440
you to do. No. Okay. What? Nothing tastes as good as Garbage Pail feels. Put these on your thing.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.680
Give me $200 right now or else I'll burn your house. I don't have $200. Wait, wait, wait.

24:43.680 --> 24:47.040
This is my favorite segment of the show or else I'll burn your house to the ground. Oh.

24:47.040 --> 24:52.960
Will you use the furniture as kindling? No. I'm not going to solve your problem like that. You

24:52.960 --> 24:57.600
can't backdoor trick me. So you will burn my house to the ground, but first you will remove

24:57.600 --> 25:02.400
the offending furniture from said house so that I will be left with nothing but the furniture that

25:02.400 --> 25:06.960
I so despise. And the stickers because I can't exchange. I can't return these.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.880
That's funny. Sounds like a deal. $200.

25:10.880 --> 25:19.440
$200. Storage wars. So that's another sort of angle for, oh, there he goes. There's another

25:19.440 --> 25:24.960
angle of Shower Boys is it kind of has like, what's that show called? Junkyard Buddies where

25:24.960 --> 25:30.240
they break into storage units. Kind of have that going on where we go to houses and we just auction

25:30.240 --> 25:35.840
them off and then I break it in or into them and a family's there and it's like, sorry, I auctioned

25:35.840 --> 25:42.480
it. Auction law says nine tenths of possession. This is his now. Probably the best episode of

25:42.480 --> 25:46.720
storage wars ever would be one where halfway through the auction somebody shows up like,

25:46.720 --> 25:55.040
what are you doing? These are my personal belongings. Yeah. I paid for this. This sucks.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.640
How about you want another question or another Yahoo or what are we doing here?

25:58.640 --> 26:04.400
Do another Yahoo. Yeah. I don't have that many, but sure. This one was sent in by

26:06.400 --> 26:09.360
Michelle Cassidy. Thank you, Michelle. It's by Yahoo Answers user,

26:09.360 --> 26:15.520
Gufu, who asks, and let me know if we've talked too much about this already, but Gufu asks,

26:15.520 --> 26:21.840
should truck nuts be made illegal? They are distracting. Oh shit. Another contractor just

26:21.840 --> 26:30.480
got here. Sorry. I got to welcome them into my home. One sec. Hi. If you're listening to this,

26:30.480 --> 26:36.240
you've stumbled on another episode of contractor buddies, the sequel to shower buddies. Why now

26:36.240 --> 26:42.560
there are two contractors in the house. They will be competing both for Griffin's money and his love.

26:43.360 --> 26:49.920
Which contract? If you listen closely, you'll be able to hear Griffin. Pretend he's a grownup

26:49.920 --> 26:54.000
who knows what needs to happen in order for this exchange to take place.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.240
He has just been handed a business card by the contractor and he is forced to pretend as though

26:58.240 --> 27:03.360
he won't immediately lose it. As the contractor outlines their plans, Griffin's going to nod

27:03.360 --> 27:09.040
in an agreeable fashion. He will not comprehend anything that they're saying. Griffin may gesture

27:09.040 --> 27:15.840
towards a bag and say, those your tools? Great, great. At some point, Griffin may be asked to

27:15.840 --> 27:23.680
assist in a menial fashion with this exchange. He will do it wrong. I cannot emphasize this enough.

27:23.680 --> 27:30.640
His anxiety over the situation will paralyze him. What a pickle. Guys, what a jar of pickles I've

27:30.640 --> 27:34.320
got myself into because that wasn't another contractor. It was actually a private detective

27:34.320 --> 27:43.120
looking for Richard Karn. I had to kill. I had to kill him. I had to kill him, but luckily Matthew

27:43.120 --> 27:46.160
could keep a secret. He's just going to help me. He's going to put him in the shower wall.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.800
But you're going to lose significant inches in your shower, Griffin.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.880
No, I know, but I'm going to gain inches in freedom of not being in

27:54.880 --> 27:58.720
prison because now I got murder one and card napping.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.640
Should truck nuts be made illegal?

28:05.280 --> 28:11.120
I was driving today behind a truck today that had truck nuts. I laughed a little bit when I saw them

28:11.120 --> 28:14.720
at first, but while driving behind the truck, I found myself mesmerized by those things

28:14.720 --> 28:19.040
bouncing around and I couldn't keep my eyes off of them. Those things are so distracting

28:19.760 --> 28:23.280
that they can potentially cause accidents. Should truck nuts be made illegal?

28:24.960 --> 28:29.040
I like how many times they said the word those things and I would actually prefer if we could

28:29.040 --> 28:35.200
stick to that vernacular as well. Wouldn't it be great if that was like in the new James Bond movie

28:35.200 --> 28:41.600
they pressed a button and just like deployed those things and suddenly like the enemy, the

28:41.600 --> 28:47.440
whatever, the Spectre agents were so distracted by their pendulous nature that they like careened

28:47.440 --> 28:52.800
off a cliff? Yeah, that would be funny as fuck, dude. If truck nuts were the new caltrops?

28:54.080 --> 28:57.040
Judy Dench was like, check this out.

28:57.040 --> 29:01.600
I'm back to life.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.200
That was her leaping for her casket, right? Yeah, but now with truck nuts.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.440
We can't. She's a dame. We can't say these things.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.280
More like, damn, look at those truck nuts.

29:18.080 --> 29:26.320
All right. That joke was rough. So that one was in shower boys. That wasn't a good one.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.880
Because it needs considerable rehab. I'm going to do a little bit word swap.

29:31.760 --> 29:40.080
Okay. Look at those truck nuts. Damn, Judy Dench. Is that better or worse? Where are we at?

29:40.080 --> 29:44.880
It's not even a joke. It's nothing at all. Well, I was trying to make it sound like I was saying

29:44.880 --> 29:49.600
dame Judy Dench, but instead I say damn Judy. Oh, that's good. You can use that for a lot of things.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.920
Yeah, I mean, you could follow up damn Judy Dench with pretty much anything.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.400
Damn, Judy Dench back at it again with the white kids.

30:00.560 --> 30:05.280
Were they kids or vans? They were vans. Vans, yeah. It's all right. I mean,

30:05.280 --> 30:10.640
he might also have white kids. Did you just sneak preview the next damn Daniel?

30:10.640 --> 30:17.360
Hey, guys. This is a MBMBAM shower boys exclusive. No, fuck MBMBAM. I'm only about shower boys now.

30:17.360 --> 30:21.520
I'm kind of just Tarzan swinging from project to project, and this is the one I'm really invested

30:21.520 --> 30:27.840
in now, and it's the sequel to damn Daniel, and I'm proud to announce it here on shower boys.

30:28.480 --> 30:32.400
All this talk of truck nuts has got me wanting to buy some for myself.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.240
For your Volkswagen?

30:36.240 --> 30:42.240
No. For my Kia Sportage. For my 2008 Kia Sportage.

30:42.240 --> 30:46.960
I would love to see the pair of truck nuts hanging from a Kia Sportage.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.440
That's the sensible truck nuts.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.480
Yeah, I got a Kia Sportage, and these are what my nuts look like.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.880
I wanted to sound cool saying that, but also very quiet.

31:00.240 --> 31:04.640
It's important that I emphasize the 2008 because that had the most unappealing body

31:04.640 --> 31:08.000
design of any Kia Sportage. It's the minkus of cars.

31:08.000 --> 31:16.240
But not with this fucking cool hog basket hanging from it.

31:16.240 --> 31:20.480
Could you put truck nuts on minkus and make him cool?

31:21.360 --> 31:22.160
Yes.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.520
Oh god, let's get out of this. Let's jettison.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.440
Okay, the crazy thing about truck nuts to me, and there are many. Oh,

31:33.440 --> 31:36.320
we'll get to the money soon in a second, but I gotta talk about truck nuts for a second.

31:36.320 --> 31:40.800
The thing that you have to remember about truck nuts is that by definition,

31:40.800 --> 31:45.760
what precedes that is somebody in a store and they see nuts hanging off of a hook,

31:45.760 --> 31:48.560
and they say, I'd love to put those bad boys on my vehicle.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.680
You gotta run it back further. Someone sat down with like a sketch pad and drew them,

31:55.680 --> 31:59.840
and at first went, because if you've ever noticed, drew them symmetrically and went,

31:59.840 --> 32:04.560
no, no, no, not believable. So then they redrew them so that one nut hung slightly lower,

32:04.560 --> 32:10.400
and they say yes. Yes, yes, yes. And then a sculptor took it, took that design,

32:10.400 --> 32:15.680
and welded it, like lovingly cast them. There's a factory where they make those,

32:15.680 --> 32:18.800
and there's people who work at that factory as their jobs.

32:18.800 --> 32:23.760
Mr. Johnson, thank you for joining us on Bring Your Parent to Work Day.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.360
Please tell the class what you do. I'd really rather not.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.800
Hey, Bring Your Parent to Work Day would be crazy.

32:30.800 --> 32:36.800
Oh, oh, whoops. You know what? Fuck it. Money's up.

32:47.600 --> 32:52.720
Ah, here we go. Truck nuts are a high-quality novelty automotive accessory that hang from

32:52.720 --> 32:57.280
any bumper, and let folks show the world they're nuts. This is our first sponsor.

32:57.280 --> 33:02.960
Available in white, blue, flesh, black, red, yellow, chrome, and green, and camo,

33:02.960 --> 33:06.800
when you just really can't anymore. When you want nuts on your car,

33:06.800 --> 33:09.760
but you don't want anybody to know about it or see them.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.520
How much would you guys be willing to pay for truck nuts?

33:14.160 --> 33:16.960
$14.99 a minute. $19.99.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.840
Fucking $15. Exactly, Griffin. Off by a penny. You crushed it.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.240
They're the toughest in the industry, and they're guaranteed not to fade,

33:26.240 --> 33:30.240
chip, crack, or break. Hey, I want to buy these.

33:31.040 --> 33:36.880
Are they going to chip at all? Is chipping going to be a concern for this hog basket?

33:36.880 --> 33:41.280
How much nut mass will I lose over the course of, say, a calendar year?

33:41.280 --> 33:45.280
Are these resistant from the tars and other perils of the road?

33:47.520 --> 33:53.680
I should mention that the truck nut site, you can also get bumper stickers about truck nuts,

33:53.680 --> 33:57.120
which there's very little funnier to me than the idea of somebody who has a truck

33:57.120 --> 33:59.840
nuts bumper sticker but no truck nuts, as if to say, someday.

33:59.840 --> 34:04.720
Watch this space. Watch this space. I got the first few payments in.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.280
Exciting developments. They're coming soon.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.560
How many Osama Bin Laden-related bumper stickers do you think are available on the truck nuts site?

34:14.560 --> 34:16.640
Three. Did you guess two?

34:18.240 --> 34:19.840
He guessed three. He said it out loud. You heard him.

34:20.640 --> 34:23.360
They are selling a bumper sticker that has a picture of Saddam Hussein

34:23.360 --> 34:28.400
and Osama Bin Laden, and it says, one down, one to go. That's not even applicable anymore.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.720
Maybe that person was saying, that's what I'll buy my truck.

34:34.720 --> 34:38.400
I will buy my truck nuts on the day that Osama Bin Laden is killed.

34:39.600 --> 34:44.000
Those will be celebratory truck nuts. Where can I buy a truck vagina?

34:45.680 --> 34:49.200
Yeah, that's the real question. What I really like is that our first sponsor is actually

34:49.200 --> 34:53.440
Bowling Branch, and in the copy that they sent us, this is the first line of the copy,

34:53.440 --> 34:56.480
please feel free to ad-lib the intro with a personalized story.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.600
I think we kind of did that.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.200
You got it.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.680
Somebody tell me about Bowling Branch.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.200
I slept on Bowling Branch sheets last night.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.000
Oh yeah? How'd it go?

35:08.960 --> 35:14.320
They were glorious. We've had them for a while now. As we wash them, they get more and more

35:14.320 --> 35:21.120
comfortable. A thing I've never experienced with sheets before. You know why? Because they

35:21.120 --> 35:27.440
don't worry about thread count or any of that bull roar. They just get really good quality

35:28.240 --> 35:34.480
cotton and material and stuff, and that's what they use. And they make them real good.

35:34.480 --> 35:39.440
And now you think, real good sheets, huh? I've been taken in by real good sheets before,

35:39.440 --> 35:44.720
and I had to pay an astronomical price at the department store. Well, you're a fool.

35:45.280 --> 35:49.680
You could have ordered them on BowlingBranch.com, and it would have been way cheaper because they

35:49.680 --> 35:53.920
have way less overhead. They don't have that brick and mortar stuff to pay for.

35:53.920 --> 35:59.600
They have a website, which is not a brick and mortar place. It's a bits and bytes place,

35:59.600 --> 36:05.040
and bits and bytes are a lot cheaper. And now you can try them risk-free for 30 nights,

36:05.040 --> 36:12.400
and if you don't love them, you can send them back. And you just got to go to BowlingBranch.com.

36:13.200 --> 36:18.400
And if you go to BowlingBranch, and you use the promo code MYBROTHER, you get 20% off your entire

36:18.400 --> 36:22.560
order. And they don't just have sheets, they got towels, they got blankets, they got duvet covers,

36:22.560 --> 36:26.720
everything, plus free shipping. I'm a big fan, and I think you will be too.

36:26.720 --> 36:35.440
Where's that website and the promo code again, Trav? It's BowlingBranch.com,

36:36.000 --> 36:41.760
with the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word. Oh, you go ahead, Griffin.

36:41.760 --> 36:50.000
I want to tell you all about Club W. It's a wonderful service that takes bottles of wine

36:50.000 --> 36:54.400
and gets them to your house, your kitchen, your glass, and your mouth, and your tummy.

36:54.400 --> 37:02.800
We got a special segment on Shower Boys called Wine Time. I just get loaded drunk,

37:02.800 --> 37:07.920
really fucked up, and just keep asking questions about where they are at in the project.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.080
You're basically describing rosebuddies at this point, though.

37:12.800 --> 37:13.920
Yeah, that's a good point.

37:13.920 --> 37:17.600
But if, Griffin, we're on The Bachelor standing behind them going,

37:17.600 --> 37:24.880
you guys got a gift? What are you doing? Hey, Kale, are you feeling it? It seemed like you guys

37:24.880 --> 37:30.640
were really feeling it. Club W, though, is going to get you wine to your house, and not just any

37:30.640 --> 37:39.200
old wine. Oops. It's Wine Time came early today, folks. Not just any wine. Wine that is going to be

37:39.200 --> 37:45.280
delicious, and it's going to be tailored specifically for you. There's an easy six-question

37:45.280 --> 37:49.120
quiz that figures out what your palate is like, so that every bottle you receive is

37:49.120 --> 37:53.520
perfectly tailored to your taste. They got a no-risk guarantee. You're going to love what

37:53.520 --> 37:59.200
they send you. Right now, Club W is offering listeners $20 off your first order when you go

my brother. And not only that, Club W is actually going to pay for your shipping on orders of four

38:12.240 --> 38:16.160
bottles or more, and of course you're going to want it. What, are you going to get two bottles?

38:16.160 --> 38:21.200
You can knock that out over a lunch. Take something off your duty list. Go to clubw.com slash my

38:21.200 --> 38:25.680
brother. Get $20 off your first order now. Get some great wine. Perfect for you. All right,

38:25.680 --> 38:32.560
this next one's a puzzle. I got a personal message. And I hope this makes sense to literally

38:32.560 --> 38:37.200
one human being on Earth, because it seems to be specifically targeted at that person.

38:37.200 --> 38:47.120
This is a message for Isabelle. And the message is this. That's Panini. And it's from,

38:48.960 --> 38:52.960
we have no idea. Nobody. There's nothing in this field. Maybe the universe sort of

38:52.960 --> 38:57.360
conspired to send Isabelle a message as if to say like, hey, go for it. Shit,

38:57.360 --> 39:03.840
this is the singularity. What does that mean? The internet generated this. That like the,

39:03.840 --> 39:08.720
the, the content. This is the Google. This is the Google go bot blowing off steam.

39:09.360 --> 39:16.400
The AI consciousness wants Isabelle to know that's Panini.

39:18.560 --> 39:25.280
I have no idea what this message means. I'm worried about it. Yeah, it's weird, but like,

39:26.080 --> 39:29.680
thanks for the message, I guess. Thanks for the hundred dollars. Thanks for the hundred

39:29.680 --> 39:33.440
dollars Google go bot. I don't know where you got money from. You probably hacked into

39:33.440 --> 39:38.320
your dad's account or something. I want to, I want to read another one. Hopefully you enjoy that

39:38.320 --> 39:44.320
Isabelle. If you're a human and not a computer, I got a message for Dylan and this is from Sarah.

39:44.320 --> 39:49.120
Happy anniversary to the best hunky boy. Thank you for making these past five years amazing with

39:49.120 --> 39:54.080
your premium goose cartoons in the Japanese style, pointy hair and really great hugs.

39:54.080 --> 39:59.680
Sounds like a cool person. Honestly, to me, sounds a good person. You're my best friend and the best

39:59.680 --> 40:04.720
cat stepfather and obese tabby could ask for. I'm so glad that I met you and here's to many more

40:04.720 --> 40:13.200
years together. I love you. And then it says at the end, that's weird. It's weird. This is weird

40:13.200 --> 40:16.880
guys. I'm looking at the rest of the questions that we have picked out and the Yahoo's that I

40:16.880 --> 40:21.440
had selected from the ones that people sent in. Um, and let me just like, so let me read this.

40:21.440 --> 40:29.280
Yahoo right now, uh, is from Yahoo answers issue. That's Panini. And, uh, they asked that's Panini.

40:29.280 --> 40:37.920
Oh no. Um, uh, so happy anniversary Dylan and Sarah. I can't imagine when that must've been

40:37.920 --> 40:45.360
months ago. I'm sure, but I hope in the future, maybe Sarah overshot it and she got it in like

40:45.360 --> 40:52.480
eight months before their anniversary and we read it too soon. Maybe I'm Jesse Thorn. I'm Jordan

40:52.480 --> 40:57.680
Morris. The federal government has millions of dollars in programs and opportunities that you

40:57.680 --> 41:03.040
need to seize today. You're a taxpayer, right? Well, then you've got it coming. Thanks to uncle

41:03.040 --> 41:09.200
Sam. You can learn to get grants for education, learn to ride a llama, print money the old

41:09.200 --> 41:16.160
fashioned way, force your dog to stop being so rambunctious, make a souffle that sets and stays

41:16.160 --> 41:22.720
set, mount the heads of your enemies on spikes, grind your own corrective lenses using just rock

41:22.720 --> 41:30.400
salt and diamonds for all of this and more. Drop us a line. Don't wait right now. Jordan, Jesse,

41:30.400 --> 41:36.640
go one, two, three iTunes street or wherever you download podcasts. Here's another question.

41:37.840 --> 41:42.240
I take a prescription Ambien every night to go to sleep. While it works great, I do suffer from

41:42.240 --> 41:47.600
one of the known side effects, sleep eating. I apparently get out of bed and make delicious,

41:47.600 --> 41:53.440
but terribly high calorie snacks before falling asleep for good. For example, my wife informed

41:53.440 --> 42:00.800
me that last night I made an ice cream sandwich using pop tarts and magic show. Oh, damn, damn.

42:01.920 --> 42:06.080
What's up? You can have a pop up in L.A. with that. That's like a new hot. Yeah, absolutely.

42:07.280 --> 42:10.400
I usually have a vague recollection of my nighttime noshing the next day,

42:12.240 --> 42:16.480
but I'm disappointed in both the unhealthy eating and the kitchen messes that I leave.

42:16.480 --> 42:20.800
Brothers, how can I prevent myself from creating these late night shame snacks

42:20.800 --> 42:28.640
while still using my sleep as intended? That's from midnight. Midnight. Man, Manjia. Yeah, sure.

42:29.440 --> 42:35.280
Sure. I can't tell a story real quick. Sure. I mean, I feel like we all have a good dad

42:35.280 --> 42:40.880
Ambien story. Oh, yeah. Ranging ranging from the not hilarious like the time he fell down some

42:40.880 --> 42:46.400
stairs to the hysterical like the time my car got broken into in the west end of Huntington.

42:46.400 --> 42:53.280
Um, and this was at about seven thirty eight p.m. I called Daddy. I was like,

42:53.280 --> 42:57.360
Daddy, I'm crying. I'm crying. I'm scared. I'm sad. My car got broken into. Somebody stole all

42:57.360 --> 43:03.360
my tapes. And as soon as I called him, I told him what had happened and I needed him to come

43:03.360 --> 43:10.000
come over. He his his reaction was not what I expected. I was expecting like, Oh, don't worry,

43:10.000 --> 43:17.360
son. I'll be there in just a moment. What I got was a shit because Daddy had just popped a fistful

43:17.360 --> 43:24.080
of Ambien. And when he showed up, he was not in a good state, not in like a safe driving place,

43:24.080 --> 43:30.240
certainly. So I sent him home. And when I got home at around like eleven thirty. Thanks,

43:30.240 --> 43:35.440
Huntington cops. You got there real quick and speedy like never never boy came out, didn't he?

43:35.440 --> 43:41.120
Who came? I came, didn't I? Yeah, I came. Yeah, you came. You relieved Dad. Yeah.

43:42.560 --> 43:49.840
And when I got home where I live with my daddy, there's a big old box, empty box of Jolly Pirate

43:49.840 --> 44:00.960
Donuts, like a dozen. Oh, Daddy. Daddy had just taken them to church. No recollection, no memory

44:00.960 --> 44:08.640
of these sweet donuts going going down the hatch. But unless he got like a couple and like as as

44:08.640 --> 44:13.520
goofed up as he was, was like, no, I want him in a big boy box. You put those two donuts in the big

44:13.520 --> 44:19.600
boy box. I believe we confirmed on a receipt that he bought a dozen. Okay. Well, we did some

44:19.600 --> 44:27.040
encyclopedia Browning. Anyway, that's that's a good one. That's a good story. Yeah. Ambien,

44:27.040 --> 44:33.920
I can't believe that shit's legal. You know, some people really rely on it and need it.

44:33.920 --> 44:39.520
No, I know that, but it seems like it seems like I don't know, man. I mean, I like to get high

44:39.520 --> 44:47.520
and party and stuff, but I've seen Dad get like, whoa, dude, like, oh, oh, started on Ambien before.

44:48.320 --> 44:56.560
Yeah, I mean, I think the obvious answer is to lock your bedroom door from the inside because

44:56.560 --> 45:01.520
maybe you. Okay, wait a minute. I don't know that much about sleep eating. Are you just like,

45:02.320 --> 45:05.920
are you just like the second you wake up and start sleeping? Are you just making repeated

45:05.920 --> 45:10.800
motions of moving your hand from a place in front of you up to your mouth and then chewing?

45:10.800 --> 45:16.640
Like you're making that like if your robot was programmed to eat, like, are you just doing that

45:16.640 --> 45:23.680
until you run into some food or do you have like the mental acuity to like go eat like to unlock

45:23.680 --> 45:29.280
a door that you locked? This is a good, like, have you ever caught yourself eating like sardines and

45:29.280 --> 45:34.720
graham crackers and it's just like whatever, like your hand's sweet. What if, okay, I've got it. I've

45:34.720 --> 45:42.240
got it. I've got it. You gotta accentuate the positive. You set up a webcam every night. You

45:42.240 --> 45:48.320
film yourself doing it. New hit YouTube cooking show, sleep eating with Dave. It's like that

45:48.320 --> 45:56.080
drunk kitchen YouTube show. Yes, but it's sleep eating. This seems exceedingly dangerous.

45:56.960 --> 46:01.120
Yeah, it seems really, you know what you should do? Oh, oh, this is even better. What does everybody

46:01.120 --> 46:07.440
hate to eat? No matter who they are and no matter what kind it is, vegetables, obviously. So what

46:07.440 --> 46:13.440
you do is you put a tray of vegetables by your bed every night. So when you wake up and start

46:13.440 --> 46:18.720
sleeping, oh, what's that? Some healthy options. Excellent. These are so close. I'll just go ahead

46:18.720 --> 46:23.600
and eat this celery with like low fat cream cheese on it. Get some ants on a log going maybe with a

46:23.600 --> 46:31.600
few saltanas on there. And you can eat, you can like force yourself to eat healthy vegetables,

46:32.160 --> 46:39.200
but you don't have to like know you're doing it. You know? Well, why don't you, if we want to get

46:39.200 --> 46:43.040
you really fit, like if we want to get your body so right when you're asleep, because who's got the

46:43.040 --> 46:47.040
time in the waking hours? Um, why don't you put those vegetables in the kitchen where you're

46:47.040 --> 46:50.640
normally going to go to snack down, get rid of all your unhealthy food so you don't accidentally

46:50.640 --> 46:55.920
fall into some of that and then put between yourself and your kitchen, a big fun obstacle

46:55.920 --> 47:02.000
course. Yeah. And then do film that. Cause holy shit. I would love, I would love to peep that.

47:02.000 --> 47:08.080
Are you kidding me? I would love to watch. I would love to watch our sleepy dad, like try to climb up

47:08.080 --> 47:15.040
a ramp. Sleepy ninja warrior. What if it was live stream? Like, can you imagine this new sounds

47:15.920 --> 47:19.760
trying to diagnose what's going on? Is that the new shower? They're just like dragging it in

47:19.760 --> 47:24.880
from the front door. I don't think that's how it works. Sorry. Go on. Uh, what, what if you

47:24.880 --> 47:28.960
could live stream it? So like, imagine you're sitting around living your life and you get a

47:28.960 --> 47:33.840
notification on your phone. It's like, here you go again. Here we go. Time to do it. Is this the

47:33.840 --> 47:39.760
night he dies? Is this the night? No, the obstacle course would be made out of fun, like foamy pads

47:39.760 --> 47:45.680
and stuff. This is, it would be safe. It would be safe for the user. Um, and there will be like

47:45.680 --> 47:50.560
referees and lifeguards on duty at all times. I gotta be honest. As long as we're talking about,

47:50.560 --> 47:58.320
like turning your negative experience into a positive, like web streaming entertainment

47:58.320 --> 48:03.280
experience for me. Um, let's just do a fucking cooking show because you've unlocked something

48:03.280 --> 48:08.080
like primal and, and amazing with this ice cream sandwich made of pop tarts and magic shell

48:08.080 --> 48:12.720
situation. Like I don't think a sober mind is going to be able to crack that potential nut.

48:12.720 --> 48:16.480
I think this is probably how Guy Fieri comes up with most of his stuff. Most of his goods.

48:18.080 --> 48:21.680
Just like in a full on tra- I think most of Guy Fieri's goodies come from like,

48:22.640 --> 48:28.720
I think Flavortown exists only in his ambient mind. And then like he wakes up the next morning

48:28.720 --> 48:33.360
and it's like the, the, the, the gnomes have done the cobbling for him. You know what I mean?

48:33.360 --> 48:38.800
And then made a cobbler out of nachos. He's like, what? Sick. Thanks gnomes.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.480
But it's really him. He's just fucked up.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.880
Do you think when he bites into it, he just goes gnome chompsky?

48:44.880 --> 49:00.640
No, what? What? What? How could this be? Is it back? It's back. It's haunted doll watch.

49:00.640 --> 49:04.880
I got a live one here coming in straight from the electronic bay. This is, here's the listing.

49:04.880 --> 49:09.440
I'm going to read it to you. And where I take pauses is where there are periods. Haunted doll,

49:09.440 --> 49:18.640
ghost meter active, paranormal, supernatural, which is dull. Okay. So here's the listing.

49:18.640 --> 49:21.280
And I'm going to read the description. It's a short one. So let me get through it.

49:22.240 --> 49:25.920
She comes from a haunted antique auction that was held a few days ago in nearby the pointed

49:25.920 --> 49:31.680
hat store in port Jervis. I was told this vessels and is antique and very viable for collectors,

49:31.680 --> 49:34.000
but I felt more attracted to it because of its haunting value.

49:34.000 --> 49:43.360
That's like, that's like I saw a $20 doll and I just can't shake how good of a value that is.

49:45.920 --> 49:50.720
The smell attaches dolls been in it for many, many years. The spirit is the spirit of a native

49:50.720 --> 49:57.280
American Indian just covered all the bases there. And it's a female spirit of age 18 to 24 years

49:57.280 --> 50:01.600
old. The spirit is very attached to the vessel and refused to move on. We had some paranormal

50:01.600 --> 50:05.680
experts who main purpose of buying spirit dolls is to help them stay moving to the other side

50:05.680 --> 50:09.200
and not saying stuck in a vessel. This worked out well in the past with the other vessels,

50:09.200 --> 50:12.960
but I sold as experts. I wouldn't recommend to try this, this vessel. Cause she clearly stated

50:12.960 --> 50:18.240
she wants to remain in this vessel and it ends with good luck comma as though they were killed.

50:21.680 --> 50:28.000
It's not a ringing endorsement. No, the thing I wanted to hit on is, um, I, uh, she comes from

50:28.000 --> 50:33.440
a haunted antique auction that was held a few days ago in nearby the pointed hat store at port

50:33.440 --> 50:41.680
Jervis held a few days ago. This person is flipping haunted dolls. They are downright spooky.

50:44.960 --> 50:47.680
They're flipping these dolls. They're getting it. They're polishing it up,

50:47.680 --> 50:52.480
taking some great photography, writing a great story and they're flipping haunted dolls.

50:52.480 --> 50:55.840
What did you think they meant when they said they wanted to keep them moving on, Justin?

50:55.840 --> 51:00.080
Oh, you mean like no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.440
From into your hands. So you can start enjoying them at home right now.

51:03.440 --> 51:06.000
They got to stay in the haunted doll bubble.

51:06.000 --> 51:12.080
Is there someone out there, hypothetically speaking, who in an attempt to keep this

51:12.080 --> 51:17.360
market from becoming flooded and over saturated, cause a flooded haunted doll market is bad for

51:17.360 --> 51:26.320
everyone, um, is de-haunting dolls is actually making them move on. I'm thinking of like the

51:26.320 --> 51:34.240
exorcist from, um, well, the exorcist or poltergeist, um, just like, just like blasting,

51:34.240 --> 51:39.520
busting, busting ghouls out of these dolls so that the ones that are definitely still haunted,

51:39.520 --> 51:44.480
uh, are like increasing value. Do you think that's happening out there somewhere?

51:44.480 --> 51:49.520
Yeah. I mean, there's got to be some kind of haunted doll decommissioner.

51:50.960 --> 51:55.760
Somebody because like, okay, because what you don't want, you, there would have to be some

51:55.760 --> 52:00.160
kind of governing body. Cause what you don't want is somebody to like move the spirit on from the

52:00.160 --> 52:05.600
doll, but then continue to flip it like it is a haunted doll. So you need some kind of like

52:05.600 --> 52:09.840
certified 100% haunted. Yeah. Like still.

52:09.840 --> 52:16.320
Uh, what you could do is just head on over to the electronic bay and search banishing kit.

52:16.320 --> 52:22.080
Oh yeah. And you've got 17 different, uh, results for different ways to, now here's the one thing

52:22.080 --> 52:27.840
that does trouble me a little bit about these 17 different banishing kits is that they're all wildly

52:27.840 --> 52:33.280
different, which almost makes me wonder, you know, are they effective?

52:33.280 --> 52:37.360
You want, there's 17 different kinds of spirits. OVS.

52:37.360 --> 52:43.360
Yeah. Fire type, water type, grass type, ground type, dark type, steel type, fairy type, dragon

52:43.360 --> 52:51.840
type, ice type, flying type, bug type, psychic. Oh, oh, it's getting real in there. Oh God. I hope

52:51.840 --> 52:57.200
that's, I hope that that buzz saw is being used on, on ceramic and not on carn flash.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.800
Uh, well that's going to do it for us folks. Thank you for joining us for another episode of

53:02.800 --> 53:07.600
my brother, my brother and me. Uh, we hope you had, sorry, Travis, did you have something that

53:07.600 --> 53:11.600
you wanted to interrupt to say? Well, I just, some people tune out during the housekeeping

53:11.600 --> 53:16.480
and I wanted to let everyone know we're coming up on our 300th episode and I'm working on like a

53:16.480 --> 53:26.960
project for it, a sound collage. So if you would like to, you can email mbmbammemories at gmail.com

53:26.960 --> 53:32.400
with a 10 to 15 second sound clip of you saying, since I started listening to my brother,

53:32.400 --> 53:40.320
my brother and me, blank, thanks mbmbam. And it would be great if the blank was filled in.

53:40.320 --> 53:42.800
What if only bad things have happened to them since they started listening?

53:42.800 --> 53:47.760
That's great. As long as it's not really a bummer, it's gotta be funny or sincere,

53:47.760 --> 53:56.000
but no bummers. Just the general, no bummers. Uh, cool. So, um, I don't know what to say.

53:56.880 --> 53:59.200
What do we say? Um, thank you.

53:59.200 --> 54:03.360
I think we say thank you. Thank you once again for everybody who came out for the max fun drive.

this week is still buffering with Justin's wife, Sydney, uh, and her sister Riley.

54:33.600 --> 54:38.560
They put out some real club banger episodes during the max fun drive. I especially enjoyed

54:38.560 --> 54:45.200
the how to music episode, uh, made me feel very nostalgic and very out of touch at the same time.

54:45.200 --> 54:47.920
That's that show's jam. That's what they do there.

54:47.920 --> 54:53.920
Um, and it's wild finding out how the kids are doing things nowadays cause it's like,

54:53.920 --> 54:54.640
it's out there.

54:54.640 --> 55:00.000

The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon and is standing over a hoard of precious

56:27.440 --> 56:32.240
golden rubies. And he says, what do you do adventures? I'm a dragon man.

56:32.240 --> 56:34.000
I cast fire on him. It's very good.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
I addressed the red dragon to say us. We're the hosts of the adventure zone,

56:38.000 --> 56:41.200
a podcast about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

56:41.200 --> 56:43.120
Very good synergy. Commit to the bit.

56:43.680 --> 56:49.520
I, I rolled to charm new listeners. It is very effective against all odds.

56:49.520 --> 56:52.560
Everybody where the macro is we host the adventure zone to podcasts where we play

56:52.560 --> 56:54.960
Dungeons and Dragons together. It's a comedy podcast.

56:54.960 --> 56:58.080
We don't take the rules too seriously because there's a lot of them and we did not take the

56:58.080 --> 56:59.360
time to learn them. Maybe listen to us.

56:59.360 --> 57:02.000
