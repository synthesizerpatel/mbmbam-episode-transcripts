WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.600
Can't do the Tim Curry thing. Can't do that. Why not? I think you've done it more than once,

00:49.600 --> 00:54.880
so like why break tradition now? That's a good point. I mean, I'm saying you've already done

00:54.880 --> 01:00.640
it more than once, why say, but I can't do it three times? Maybe just skip the intro because

01:00.640 --> 01:05.760
the intro always goes a little bit long, and just get into like the meat of the of the tune.

01:05.760 --> 01:14.320
Okay. Scary, freaky, crawly Halloween. In media res, Tim Curry.

01:17.440 --> 01:24.720
Wow, I can't believe I sang the whole thing. Yeah. To my brother, my brother, my brother,

01:24.720 --> 01:39.120
my brother, and Merman? There's nothing spooky about the name. My brother of Frankenstein,

01:39.120 --> 01:45.600
Frankenstein's brother. Yes, yes, yes. Actually, I prefer to be Frankenstein's monster's brother.

01:47.520 --> 01:51.440
I'm Doug Frankenstein. I'm the brother of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, and I'm like,

01:51.440 --> 01:56.000
well, I don't know about this. Hey, do you think it was weird? Okay, Frankenstein's brother,

01:56.000 --> 02:01.600
let's talk about him for a second. Yeah. So Dr. Frankenstein makes Frankenstein, right?

02:05.600 --> 02:10.720
Then he makes another one, Frankenstein's brother. Everybody calls the first one Frankenstein,

02:10.720 --> 02:14.800
right? Right. He's like, I called it Frankenstein. So Frankenstein's brother gets made. He's like,

02:14.800 --> 02:20.240
bzzzap. Okay, I'm awake. Hello. What time is it? Oh, cool. This is so weird to be alive. It exists.

02:20.240 --> 02:26.640
This is amazing. So who are you? I am Dr. Frankenstein. And who's that? That's Frankenstein.

02:27.920 --> 02:35.200
So I guess you just went ahead and called him. And what about me? Your name. Oh,

02:35.200 --> 02:40.320
you're the brother of Frankenstein. Well, that fucking sucks. That's weird. Call me Bill

02:40.320 --> 02:47.600
Einstein, please. Bride of Frankenstein? How about we go with Victoria, my name?

02:47.600 --> 02:53.120
Victoria. And then maybe we'll date and we'll see. This would be like if Travis was named

02:53.120 --> 02:56.240
brother of Justin, and I was called like Lil' Justin.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.600
My name is Justin. This is the Justinettes. Welcome to my brother, my brother and me,

03:03.600 --> 03:08.240
or as we're gonna call it from now on, Justin and the rest. It's an advice show for the

03:08.240 --> 03:15.520
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

03:15.520 --> 03:21.200
Oh, God almighty. Give me one of those. I don't think I should have to do a spooky

03:21.200 --> 03:26.000
voice because my voice already kind of sounds like bones. I'm Griffin McElroy.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.640
I wanted to try a thing where it was like the cryptkeeper, but he couldn't come up with

03:30.640 --> 03:35.440
a good pun. But that's still just how he sounds all the time. Because sometimes he would have

03:35.440 --> 03:41.280
to be like, yes, I would like fries with that. Yeah. And it's like, oh, what's the joke?

03:41.280 --> 03:45.520
Like, there's no joke. I'm just a hungry boy. I'm a hungry. Yeah. He has to live.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.920
I'm sorry I don't get it. There's no need to be rude. Just tell me what's the pun.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.120
Nope. This is just me all the time. I'm actually feeling really down today and

03:55.120 --> 04:00.240
just wanted some comfort food. Doesn't the flop house have a legal

04:00.240 --> 04:08.080
copyright on talking about cryptkeeper? Don't they have the lifetime TM on that

04:08.080 --> 04:11.680
particular character? Anything can happen on Halloween.

04:11.680 --> 04:18.480
Oh, we're back. Once Justin starts stepping on Travis's toes, on his goof toes, you can just

04:18.480 --> 04:22.320
drop that and he'll get distracted as if a child distracted by a pinwheel or something.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.240
Well, that's the thing is that once that precedent is set, once it's established that

04:26.240 --> 04:31.040
anything can happen on Halloween, there's no rules just right anyway.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.520
Yeah. So this is our Halloween

04:33.520 --> 04:41.040
spooktacular. Travis kind of, what's a nice way of putting it, deputized himself to give us a

04:41.040 --> 04:44.800
theme episode because those have gone. Yeah, pretty good, I think. Let me check the

04:44.800 --> 04:49.760
books. I mean, actually, you got friends who keep the records on this one, like baseball

04:50.400 --> 04:54.400
statisticians. And so let me just go back and check where there's a column that says themed

04:54.400 --> 04:57.440
episodes and see how. Oh, it's full of spiders.

04:57.440 --> 05:02.240
It's full of spiders. Now they're calling on me.

05:02.240 --> 05:08.640
I had a good reason, though. I wanted to do this because we got just randomly one good

05:08.640 --> 05:13.440
question about Halloween and I thought, oh, that's fun. What if we had more of these?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.120
Sort of an anchor, a spooky anchor for the rest of the episode.

05:17.120 --> 05:17.920
Yeah. Okay.

05:17.920 --> 05:24.320
And you know what? It'll also probably occur to people that this episode is horrifyingly late.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.920
And so you guys just gave me too much time to think about it.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.400
That's fair.

05:28.400 --> 05:34.560
Yeah. This is how this is how Sad Libs got started. And now here we are doing a Halloween

05:34.560 --> 05:43.200
Sweetactular. Y'all give me too much time on my own and I just have these ideas. These ideas.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.200
Here we are. Here we are talking about Halloween.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.520
Not new. This is not a Halloween watch.

05:55.520 --> 05:55.680
No.

05:55.680 --> 06:00.880
Even though that would make a lot of sense because there has just been a Halloween film

06:00.880 --> 06:02.640
and we do do that from time to time.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.160
What are you guys gonna, yeah, what are you gonna be?

06:04.160 --> 06:06.640
Oh, what are you guys gonna be this year? Wow, this is weird.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.160
What are you guys gonna be this year?

06:08.960 --> 06:12.080
Well, BB is going as Daniel Tiger.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.440
Love it.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.520
And so I thought that I would kind of do a complimentary costume

06:18.240 --> 06:23.200
and go as Johnny the evil karate person from Karate Kid.

06:23.200 --> 06:23.840
Oh, that's fun.

06:23.840 --> 06:28.720
Now, how does that sort of jive with Daniel Tiger?

06:28.720 --> 06:31.120
Like Daniel, how the kid's name is Daniel.

06:31.120 --> 06:31.760
That's fair.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.200
Oh, Daniel.

06:33.200 --> 06:33.760
Yes.

06:33.760 --> 06:39.440
My little guy is going to dress up like a lion because you can just do that when they're small.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.840
It's just like, yeah, they're a puppy. Fucking look at them. It's incredible.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.240
So he's going to be a lion. I'm going to be David S. Pumpkins.

06:46.960 --> 06:47.760
Nice.

06:47.760 --> 06:52.320
This 2018 and I'm here to say David S. Pumpkins is still in my heart.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.800
He still lives in my heart. I've made room for him. He's not a victim. He's in there.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.960
We're all doing superheroes.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.600
Because Charlie's going to be Supergirl.

07:03.600 --> 07:03.840
Cool.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.800
And there's just, you know, I've always struggled finding

07:09.600 --> 07:13.040
sort of more rotund costumes that I can feel great about.

07:13.040 --> 07:13.520
All right.

07:13.520 --> 07:18.880
But pretty low on that list is like skin tight lycra.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.880
Yeah.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.800
So I'm probably going to have to do the Superman t-shirt thing

07:26.960 --> 07:28.800
underneath like a dress, like I'm chained.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.760
Like you caught me.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.440
Oh, that's fine.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.920
Now I do like that, but let me say, Justin, I think you would look beautiful whatever you wear

07:35.920 --> 07:39.280
because I know you and I think you would fucking own it.

07:39.280 --> 07:39.520
Yeah.

07:39.520 --> 07:43.040
Well, I did order a full Superman costume.

07:43.040 --> 07:43.600
Nice.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.360
So we are going to try that on and just see how it grabs us.

07:47.360 --> 07:52.160
Maybe a little bit of a Kingdom Come vibe for all you comic heads out there.

07:53.280 --> 07:57.440
Well, we'll give it a whirl, whirlsy daisy.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.640
Anywho, so, but I did see it.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.640
I saw, you know, I saw a t-shirt that had, well, I was looking for a costume.

08:04.640 --> 08:10.160
I saw a t-shirt that had printed on it, the Clark Kent dress shirt

08:10.800 --> 08:13.360
with the Superman t-shirt underneath.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.840
It was like, it's just a lot of layers.

08:15.840 --> 08:16.960
That's three shirts.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.600
Away.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.200
Yeah, it's like three shirts in one.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.800
Fuck yeah, I love that shit.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.080
Why don't they do that more?

08:22.080 --> 08:27.600
If I go to, you know, J. Crew and I want to get some autumnal layers going,

08:27.600 --> 08:34.800
don't make me buy, you know, a jacket Oxford t-shirt with a tank top underneath it.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.400
Just give me one big shirt that looks like all of them for $40.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.120
I'm going to get into our very spooky Halloween questions

08:43.120 --> 08:46.560
because if we don't do them this week, we're not fucking going to do them ever.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.680
So let's go.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.600
I'm working at a professional haunted house this year.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.240
Nice.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.320
And I have this problem where people take what I say literally and ruin the scare.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.920
For example, my character was right before a train scare.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.400
Is that, you just kind of threw that out there.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.320
Like, well, you got a train scare coming up.

09:03.360 --> 09:07.200
Well, I think context clues don't make sense as we continue on with the question.

09:07.200 --> 09:07.700
Okay.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.760
I was supposed to have died on the tracks.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.880
So I would scream, don't go on the tracks.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.720
It doesn't happen too often.

09:14.720 --> 09:19.360
But every now and then, Bingus is like, okay, well, let me turn our whole group around

09:19.920 --> 09:22.320
and not go obviously forward.

09:22.320 --> 09:22.960
Where do we go?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.640
I wouldn't go in there.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.440
Oh, all right.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.320
Sick.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.040
You obviously had a bit of trouble with the train, so I don't learn from the rest of that.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
It does seem dangerous.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.840
So I guess I'll, is this way to funnel cake?

09:39.440 --> 09:40.800
What can I do in response?

09:40.800 --> 09:45.600
I've stuttered and yelled, I want you to go on the tracks as a last resort.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.640
No, you know what?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.240
Do go on the tracks.

09:48.240 --> 09:52.080
Winging it in Westland is who that is from.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.280
That is very good.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.960
That's a very good quandary.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.080
I miss haunted houses.

09:56.080 --> 09:56.480
Me too.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.880
It used to be fun and easy to go to them before I had children.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.480
Now it's a little more challenging.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.800
I've worked several haunted houses in my life.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.280
This is true.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.400
I want to hear some good haunted house stories from my brother, Travis, who I love.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.120
Well, one time in La La Land.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.640
So he's got a lot of celebs.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.200
I actually did.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.000
Who's got the best feel?

10:16.000 --> 10:16.880
Jonah Hill.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.640
Jonah Hill, you got him good, huh?

10:18.640 --> 10:20.480
We scared the shit out of Jonah Hill.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.760
Oh, good, dude.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.000
Did he shit his fucking pants?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.680
He did, oddly.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.560
Nice, dude.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.920
Actually, I don't know that to be true, and I don't want to get sued for libel.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.560
Nah, if it's true, then it's true, baby, and it ain't libel.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.600
You made Jonah Hill dookiest shorts, you loved it.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.400
Awesome, dude.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.160
Now who's the maniac?

10:38.160 --> 10:38.720
Here's the thing.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.880
He shit his pants, and then he came back through three more times.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.680
He loved it.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.520
And each time he shit his pants.

10:48.480 --> 10:53.600
He said out loud, he said out loud, I've been constipated for six years.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.200
Thank you so much.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.240
I'm going to cast you my next feature.

10:59.680 --> 11:02.560
They'll teach him to drop out of the limelight to focus on directing.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.760
No, but I was in one and I fell asleep in a coffin.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.440
Well, that's pretty much the biggest story.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.160
That must have been anti-climactic for the people walking by.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.280
I was in a coffin that I popped open and scared people.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.920
And one night, when I was working a haunted house in Oklahoma,

11:17.920 --> 11:19.680
I did fall asleep in the casket.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.840
It was a good nap.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.520
I bet, dude, the dirt nap, it's sort of designed to be good.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.440
The wake up was not great.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.160
No, sure.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.760
Not a cool wake up.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.560
Here's the thing about a haunted house.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.920
End of the day, it is still a house.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.000
Thank you.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.680
And I can't say like, yo, Derek, go to the bathroom.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.800
I can't, you know what I mean?

11:44.800 --> 11:48.480
I can't say, yo, Derek, time to go upstairs to the nursery.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.280
Derek's going to go where he wants to go.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.760
It is still a house and you need to be hospitable.

11:53.760 --> 11:54.480
Do you know what I mean?

11:55.760 --> 11:58.160
Yeah, I do know what you mean.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.120
It's a house?

11:59.120 --> 12:00.720
It's a house.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.320
Lest we forget, that's, you know what?

12:04.320 --> 12:06.960
It's a haunted house, but to somebody it's a haunted home.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.160
That's what you think about.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.360
That's somebody's haunted home that you're traipsing around in

12:13.360 --> 12:18.320
and spilling your hot cocoa that you purchased in line.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.680
You're spilling that everywhere.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.120
It's somebody's haunted home.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.480
They should establish that more.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.160
There should be a room that you walk into

12:24.160 --> 12:26.560
and there's just like somebody watching TV and they're like,

12:26.560 --> 12:28.560
oh, there's nothing scary in this room.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.920
This is just the den.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.000
Do you want to fucking buy it though?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.760
Because I hate how haunted it is.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.320
Yeah, oh, would you please buy this house?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.240
Come back in like May.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.040
It sucks.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.760
Very fun usually.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.840
In May, it's the worst.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.680
Yeah, because it's still this,

12:45.680 --> 12:47.920
but also like I have to go to work.

12:47.920 --> 12:52.720
Yeah, thank you for your like sort of tourism through my life.

12:52.720 --> 12:56.000
Sort of like this life tourism, but this is my haunted home.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.120
Next time you come, could you bring some groceries or something?

12:59.120 --> 13:00.960
I haven't been able to leave the house.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.040
There's a chainsaw man by the front door.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.560
I can't go fucking anywhere.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.640
We live, this is our first Halloween in a new neighborhood

13:08.640 --> 13:09.920
that we recently moved to.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.520
And there is a house down the street that about two weeks ago,

13:13.520 --> 13:16.080
their whole front yard became covered

13:16.080 --> 13:20.400
in a barrier of black garbage bags.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.640
And you know what the fuck that means.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.480
That it's about to get really spooky in there.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.480
They don't want anybody to see the Halloween surprise.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.680
Then they spray painted the bags with a date

13:31.680 --> 13:33.520
that you know their mixtape is gonna drop

13:33.520 --> 13:34.800
and you're so fucking psyched.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.080
Yesterday, I drove by it

13:36.080 --> 13:38.800
and they had also spray painted on $5.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.320
Is your house, bud?

13:45.120 --> 13:46.160
That's a home hot.

13:46.160 --> 13:50.160
You can't turn it into an unlicensed haunted home.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.600
Like an off-track, especially scary factory.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.480
There's no way it's like OSHA standards in there.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.600
I'm like, hey, someone's gonna fucking touch you.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.680
Like, uh, no, no, no.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.440
You know what, Griffin, call OSHA.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.920
Get Etsy a haunted house.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.720
Yeah, do it.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.600
Get a license.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.840
There are rules, trust me.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.880
I've been yelled at.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.280
Here's the way you solve this one.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.160
Because you can do this and you can amp up the scares.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.920
So you act like you weren't finished with your sentence.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.080
Like, don't go across the tracks.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.360
And then they're like, okay, I won't.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.960
And then you turn around like,

14:24.960 --> 14:26.320
because I'm gonna eat your feet.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.400
And then you go after them.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.160
To like, eat their feet.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.000
And they're like, so scared.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.480
Or like, I'm gonna eat your ass.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.560
Because I'm gonna, well, get to the tracks.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.000
That could send a different message, Justin.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.360
I'm gonna eat your fucking ass.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.880
I'm gonna eat your whole ass, yeah.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.400
That might be a mixed message, though.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.920
Awesome, dude, I'm so scared.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.360
Shit.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.400
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.200
This one was sent in by Ray Gaynor.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.120
Thanks, Ray, it's Yahoo Answers User.

14:52.240 --> 14:57.680
Dan, who asks, if you pump a haunted cellar

14:57.680 --> 15:00.480
full of concrete, does it get rid of the ghost?

15:01.680 --> 15:05.120
Like, if you totally obliterate the ghost's environment

15:05.120 --> 15:07.600
by filling the whole cellar full of liquid concrete

15:07.600 --> 15:10.000
right up to the ceiling, does it effectively exorcise it?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.280
Or would the ghost just move upstairs

15:11.280 --> 15:12.080
and haunt the rest of the house?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.680
Stupid ignorant people who don't believe in ghosts

15:13.680 --> 15:14.880
should not respond to this question.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.400
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.120
Who you gonna call?

15:19.120 --> 15:20.400
Me, the Ghostbuster.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.120
Conk.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.080
All right, so I'm gonna fix this one up proper good.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.160
Ain't no fucking ghost gonna get out of this, boy.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.000
Do you have anything you need to get out of the cellar

15:28.000 --> 15:30.160
before I begin the extraction process?

15:30.160 --> 15:32.560
Well, I think our cat was down, oh.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.120
Okay, your cat, good news, cat's still down there.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.520
You know where it is, and you always will.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.640
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.560
I just reduced the square footage of your home.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.600
I'm a Ghostbuster.

15:46.480 --> 15:51.040
I mean, ghosts are, by definition, incorporeal.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.360
Yeah, but to, but counterpoint, Trav,

15:55.360 --> 15:58.560
I'm not saying that they would be like forced out,

15:59.440 --> 16:02.160
but I don't know of a ghost who would be like,

16:02.160 --> 16:04.240
oh, cool, I'm gonna brick.

16:04.240 --> 16:04.480
Yeah.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.160
I'm just gonna sit down here, I guess.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.200
The ghosts are just like, oh, okay, I get it, fine.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.960
I get it, you don't want me here.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.840
You could have just said, or like hung crosses up.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.080
You didn't have to ruin your finished basement, dog.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.600
You didn't have to kill your beloved Mr. Mittens.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.760
Like, this is gonna kill your resale value.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.880
What were you thinking?

16:22.880 --> 16:23.280
I don't think-

16:23.280 --> 16:25.280
This is like one third of the square footage of the house.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.200
You had a bar down here.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.560
Cellar's actually a lot of trouble.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.680
I would be fine with just concreting one right up.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.360
So I didn't have to deal with all the dankness,

16:33.360 --> 16:34.720
the mold, are you kidding me?

16:34.720 --> 16:35.360
And the ghosts?

16:35.360 --> 16:39.200
Folks, if it's below ground, it's gonna get wet in there.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.080
That's Earth.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.200
That actually is true,

16:41.200 --> 16:43.600
but my basement just flooded a little bit.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.760
I don't know how much water there has to be in a basement

16:45.760 --> 16:46.880
for you to call it flooded,

16:46.880 --> 16:50.000
but any presence of water that cannot be explained.

16:50.000 --> 16:50.320
Yeah.

16:50.320 --> 16:56.000
Yeah, if there was, okay, imagine there was a ghost

16:56.000 --> 16:58.720
that was extremely terrifying and very spooky.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.160
He is not friendly.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.760
I cannot highlight this enough.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.360
This is not a friendly ghost.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.320
Is he like standoffish or?

17:08.320 --> 17:10.720
No, he's like a scary fucking ghost, right?

17:10.720 --> 17:11.760
Like from the movie.

17:11.760 --> 17:12.320
What'd he kill?

17:12.320 --> 17:13.440
Does he kill?

17:13.440 --> 17:14.880
No, ghosts don't do anything.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.840
Ghosts really aren't scary,

17:15.840 --> 17:18.480
but imagine he's like a scary, frightening ghost.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.000
Like if you give him a second, he'll like try to push

17:22.000 --> 17:24.400
your board game shelf over on top of you.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.360
Oh, no.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.920
I know, but he's acting out.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.200
I just organized those.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.480
He will also maintain your basement

17:32.480 --> 17:35.600
and keep it dry and spotless.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.080
Shit.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.680
I guess what I'm saying is if you could have a butler

17:39.680 --> 17:41.120
that was also a ghost.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.320
A boodler.

17:43.040 --> 17:43.760
Thank you.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.480
That's unnecessary, but okay, I suppose.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.360
Yes, fine.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.400
We've checked with the judges.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.200
They say it's okay.

17:49.840 --> 17:50.640
A bootler.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.960
No, if you don't say it right,

17:52.960 --> 17:55.200
it just sounds like you're mispronouncing butler.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.280
You gotta say booooodler.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.840
Don't think I have to do anything of the sort.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.320
So what would you, what would you-

18:02.320 --> 18:03.440
Hey, whose phone's ringing?

18:03.440 --> 18:04.640
Hey, whose phone just rang?

18:04.640 --> 18:05.520
It's a ghost.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.240
Oh, Justin.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.360
Justin, did you get a ghost caller or?

18:09.360 --> 18:10.480
Don't be scared.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.480
I'm very scared of the rudeness that I didn't expect.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.680
The booooodness.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.680
Yeah, I thought maybe we were all very,

18:17.680 --> 18:20.880
very on the same level, but I'm terrified we're not.

18:20.880 --> 18:26.640
I thought we've been recording episodes for over nine years.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.680
Hey, wait a minute, guys.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.280
I don't have a phone.

18:30.480 --> 18:30.800
Fuck.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.120
Hell yeah, dude.

18:33.120 --> 18:33.680
Too real.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.280
It's really good.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.520
Let's get back to Justin's spooky sexy upstairs downstairs reboot.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.440
Yes, I would keep-

18:41.440 --> 18:44.480
If I had a moody standoffish acting out ghost

18:44.480 --> 18:46.480
who wasn't necessarily trying to kill me,

18:46.480 --> 18:50.320
but didn't mind tipping a board game shelf over on me,

18:50.320 --> 18:52.800
but kept my basement clean,

18:52.800 --> 18:55.280
maybe cleaned like the cat box that was down there

18:56.000 --> 18:58.400
and like kept it dry.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.360
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.800
I think I'd be okay with that.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.760
Okay, thank you, Travis.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.640
Thank you for weighing in.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.720
I have a second question.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.600
Let's say he was just a spooky ghost.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.880
Not helpful, okay?

19:12.880 --> 19:16.320
Okay, he scared your family.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.720
He scared your pets.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.080
He scared your guests.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.240
He made a very scary place to be in, okay?

19:23.040 --> 19:25.200
So you can banish this ghost,

19:25.200 --> 19:29.440
but it takes 20 minutes and you have to watch the entire time

19:30.000 --> 19:31.760
and the ghost can talk and stuff.

19:32.560 --> 19:36.960
Would you banish this ghost into non-existence

19:36.960 --> 19:38.720
if one, it took 20 minutes,

19:38.720 --> 19:40.320
two, it could talk the whole time,

19:40.320 --> 19:41.360
and three, you had to watch?

19:41.360 --> 19:43.920
And the ghost knows what's going on the whole time?

19:43.920 --> 19:44.800
It knows what's going on.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.160
It knows that you're doing it.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.080
You're like holding a giant lever

19:48.080 --> 19:50.640
to banish this ghost into non-existence,

19:50.640 --> 19:53.360
but you have to stay in the room the entire time.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.160
Is the ghost experiencing any kind of discomfort

19:56.160 --> 19:57.200
or is it just like...

19:57.200 --> 19:58.160
He's being banished.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.200
No, he's being slowly banished into non-existence.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.920
He's being nothinged and he knows that you're doing it.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.320
I think I could make a hard case for like,

20:08.320 --> 20:12.160
sorry, bud, you knocked over all my board games.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.320
I spent all afternoon organizing those.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.680
You did knock them over, so I have to destroy you forever.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.600
I have to send you to the nothing place.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.080
I don't think that's-

20:20.080 --> 20:22.160
He's gonna make a lot of promises here,

20:22.160 --> 20:23.760
and there's gonna be a lot of like,

20:23.760 --> 20:26.880
I will make you board games from now on.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.240
I'll suck your fucking dick, dude.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.360
Have you seen Ghostbusters?

20:31.360 --> 20:32.720
You ever had an ecto style?

20:34.240 --> 20:35.680
I will, I'll do it.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.840
What if that's how the Ghostbusters did it?

20:37.840 --> 20:39.520
What if rather than trap,

20:39.520 --> 20:41.360
what if when you hire the Ghostbusters,

20:41.360 --> 20:42.800
they had to stand in your living room

20:42.800 --> 20:44.720
and blast the ghost into non-existence

20:44.720 --> 20:48.160
and it took 45 minutes and they could talk the entire time?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.760
I mean, that's why they kept Slimer around.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.000
Slimer was the only one who they felt pity for.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.520
This Slimer is like a fucking ghost hospice nurse

20:55.520 --> 20:57.760
just talking the ghost into non-existence.

20:57.760 --> 21:04.080
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's fine.

21:04.080 --> 21:08.160
Rest your slimy head on what passes through your neck.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.800
It's the slime zone.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.920
Ah, nice.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.680
Ah, Ghost still got it, man.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.240
Horses are done, but Ghost still got it, man.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.520
Damn, damn, damn, damn, Daniel.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.760
How do I tell people to give me bones?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.960
I collect bones and enjoy getting them as gifts.

21:27.600 --> 21:31.360
Best gift I ever gotten was a human pelvis replica.

21:31.360 --> 21:35.680
Unfortunately, you nasty person.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.920
Unfortunately, it's always a little awkward

21:37.920 --> 21:40.400
asking people to get me bones

21:40.400 --> 21:42.720
during gift-giving holidays or birthdays.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.760
How do I ask for bones while being taken seriously

21:45.760 --> 21:47.040
and not freaking people out?

21:47.600 --> 21:48.560
That's from Cass.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.800
Probably your biggest risk is like asking to get bones

21:52.800 --> 21:54.960
and people giving you like DVD seasons

21:54.960 --> 21:56.560
starring David Boreanaz.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.560
Yeah, but really.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.680
But then you get it and you're like,

21:59.680 --> 22:01.760
oh man, this isn't bones, but then you watch a couple seasons

22:01.760 --> 22:03.440
and you're like, I'm okay with this.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.440
Yeah, and it does feature a lot of bones.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.400
There's a lot of bones.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.160
Sure, that's gonna tickle your fancy.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.680
Man, I need to get back into that show.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.040
I fell off at some point.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.960
I think I only made it through the first three or four seasons.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.160
I mean, enough that I would say I'm a bones fan,

22:20.160 --> 22:22.000
but not enough that I would say like,

22:22.000 --> 22:23.600
I know everything about bones.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.520
No one loves bones more than me.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.680
I tell you, my favorite thing is David Boreanaz

22:27.680 --> 22:30.160
versus pretty, I don't know, I wouldn't call him

22:30.160 --> 22:32.720
like an uptight FBI agent.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.680
I think he was in the FBI, but he wore funny, silly socks.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.360
And like, that's how you knew like,

22:37.360 --> 22:39.120
ah, he's a funny guy.

22:39.120 --> 22:42.320
Yeah, he knows how to find the bones too,

22:42.320 --> 22:43.600
which is so important.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.840
And I tell you, I watched that movie Lovely Bones.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.840
There was no David Boreanaz and his friend Carver

22:49.840 --> 22:51.200
finding noob skeletons.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.600
And I was so fucking pissed off by that.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.480
But anyway, if you wanna know how to get bones as a gift,

22:56.480 --> 22:58.400
there is in a way, it's wild.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.160
I think they're all illegal.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.760
I think it's illegal to own a bone.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.320
Yeah, this is kind of like saying like,

23:06.320 --> 23:08.560
I wanna get Pop-Tarts from the government.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.680
I don't know how you do that.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.920
That's sort of not a thing that they deal in.

23:12.720 --> 23:15.440
There's a place in Los Angeles,

23:15.440 --> 23:17.440
I'm trying to remember the name of it,

23:17.440 --> 23:19.680
but what keeps popping in my head is Cryptonomica

23:19.680 --> 23:22.800
because of our stupid RPG show.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.560
But there's a place that just sells jewelry

23:26.560 --> 23:29.280
made of bird skulls and pins

23:29.280 --> 23:31.360
made of rabbit skeletons or whatever.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.080
But they just want a pure bone experience, Travis.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.720
They don't want it to be fancied up.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.240
If there's a place in LA I know about,

23:38.240 --> 23:40.800
it's called La Brea Tar Pits, full of bones.

23:40.800 --> 23:43.840
You just gotta know how to get them with my special drone.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.120
That's true.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.520
Wouldn't you rather have a bone with a story

23:47.520 --> 23:49.920
than just like, I bought you this bone?

23:49.920 --> 23:51.280
That's not interesting.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.120
Right now I excavated you this bone.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.480
I pulled this out of the tar pits with Griffin's bone drone.

23:58.960 --> 23:59.920
TM, TM, TM.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.680
TM, TM, Griffin's bone drone.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.080
It can be either a drone that retrieves bones

24:06.080 --> 24:08.960
or one made out of bones for a special Halloween party.

24:08.960 --> 24:09.840
Or maybe both.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.640
Bones though, huh?

24:13.680 --> 24:14.560
Where do you get them?

24:14.560 --> 24:15.360
Who has them?

24:15.360 --> 24:17.360
Everybody, but they won't give them to you.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.640
Are they at the store?

24:18.640 --> 24:22.000
I know that probably if you went to like the butcher counter

24:22.000 --> 24:23.440
and asked for bones,

24:23.440 --> 24:25.680
I think they legally have to give it to you.

24:26.320 --> 24:26.960
Right.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.160
Does that still count?

24:28.160 --> 24:29.680
Is that the kind of bones you want?

24:30.960 --> 24:33.680
I think they love human bones

24:33.680 --> 24:36.320
and owning as many of them as possible.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.240
You think it's an insurance policy

24:38.240 --> 24:39.840
in case they have a kickball accident?

24:40.480 --> 24:42.000
Oh, replacement bones.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.520
I got a new fibula.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.720
A bone donor.

24:44.720 --> 24:49.280
I got a new tibia.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.880
Got a new Tiburon.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.800
My ulna's new.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.760
It's from a guy named Ralph.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.800
And now I have it.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.400
It would be nice to like fall off the bleachers

25:02.400 --> 25:03.520
at the big game.

25:03.520 --> 25:03.920
Yeah.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.760
And then everybody's like, oh no.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.040
And you're like, it's fine.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.640
I actually have another one of these.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.000
Yeah, I have other bones.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.280
Let me, just get me home

25:11.280 --> 25:14.000
and I'll slap a new one in there right away.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.440
It's not polite for me to pop the new bone in

25:17.440 --> 25:18.000
for everybody.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.280
Because some of y'all get squeamish.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.200
But I'll do it.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.080
Not you, Doug.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.120
I know you're weird.

25:23.120 --> 25:23.680
Not you, Doug.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.880
I've seen you play Operation.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.320
Get the fuck out of here, Doug.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.720
I'm trying recently, just to be clear,

25:28.720 --> 25:30.960
I'm trying recently to transition away

25:30.960 --> 25:33.760
from like using Steven to Doug.

25:33.760 --> 25:34.160
Oh, cool.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.120
That's my go-to funny name.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.840
We've gotten a lot of letters from Stevens.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.080
Like please, please, please, please fucking stop.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.200
Please, God, please.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.160
I mean, hell.

25:42.160 --> 25:42.640
I think you guys hate me.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.480
Derricks are never gonna get off the hook.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.920
Derricks are never, yeah.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.760
But I mean, it's gotta be,

25:48.560 --> 25:49.760
it's gotta be those names.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.600
Justin does Vicky or Victoria a lot.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.920
I do do Victoria a lot.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.000
We do need to retire Steven, though.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.320
Yeah, Steven's had a good run.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.160
God, I feel like dog shit.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.560
Wish I had some new bones.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.800
I could use a new fucking rib cage at this point.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.080
Well, Griffin, if you really want a new rib cage,

26:10.080 --> 26:13.520
I know one way we could afford it for you.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.760
By doing advertisements in the Money Zone.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.320
Oh, thank you.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.920
Yes, the money bone.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.440
I would like to tell you all about Squarespace.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.000
Yup.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.480
Yeah, that's actually great for me.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.160
Yeah, it's actually just a coincidence

26:36.160 --> 26:39.360
that then they also happen to be sponsoring us.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.120
Sponsoring us, but even if they weren't,

26:41.120 --> 26:42.320
I wanted to talk about them.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.880
Because I think that the next wave of the future

26:44.880 --> 26:46.640
is haunted websites.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.840
Yeah, it's like a haunted house,

26:49.840 --> 26:51.600
but you don't need to leave your house

26:51.600 --> 26:53.360
or go anywhere or do anything.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.520
And it's basically like as you're scrolling through,

26:55.520 --> 26:57.840
it would be like a social media platform,

26:57.840 --> 27:00.000
like a Twitter or a Facebook or an Instagram.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.280
But as you're scrolling through,

27:01.280 --> 27:03.520
every third post is scary.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
And then just when you start to expect it,

27:06.800 --> 27:08.640
then it's like every fourth post.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.960
It varies a little bit so that it works up to you.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.120
And I'm gonna work on building this idea

27:13.120 --> 27:16.720
using Squarespace to turn my cool idea

27:16.720 --> 27:21.200
into a new website to showcase my work scariness

27:21.200 --> 27:23.600
and announce an upcoming event or special project,

27:24.480 --> 27:26.960
my new innovation, my scarivation.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.680
Travis, you don't know literally anything

27:29.680 --> 27:31.120
about making websites.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.680
Oh, but Justin, I do not need to.

27:34.400 --> 27:38.400
My completely infantile brain plus Squarespace

27:38.400 --> 27:39.920
equals websites.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.680
Because Squarespace has beautiful templates

27:41.680 --> 27:43.360
created by world-class designers,

27:43.360 --> 27:44.960
powerful e-commerce functionality

27:44.960 --> 27:46.880
that lets me sell things online, which I will.

27:46.880 --> 27:50.720
There will be a lot of merch on my scary website

27:50.720 --> 27:52.480
and free and secure hosting.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.160
So I don't have to worry about anyone hacking

27:54.160 --> 27:56.480
my scary website and stealing my ideas.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.400
Sure, God, please.

27:58.400 --> 27:58.960
You got it.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.800
You just gotta go, man.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.200
Please.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.160
You just gotta read it.

28:02.160 --> 28:02.560
I mean, get it.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.400
You're making a scary website.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.360
Yeah, I just wanna make it clear.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.320
The website would be scary.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.200
Oh, so scary.

28:07.200 --> 28:10.400
Head to squarespace.com slash mybrother for a free trial.

and enter the code mybrother, all one word.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.240
I got a ghost in my dick.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.760
It's me undies time.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.240
Whoa.

28:24.240 --> 28:28.960
That is their slogan.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.080
I got a ghost in my dick.

28:30.080 --> 28:34.880
I'll put it in my me undies to where they're very, very soft

28:34.880 --> 28:37.200
and make fun, crazy prints.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.600
Do you know they also make lounge pants and tees?

28:39.600 --> 28:41.760
Well, I've been convalescing for what feels like two

28:41.760 --> 28:42.800
and a half months.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.960
I've been wearing these lounge pants so much

28:44.960 --> 28:46.240
that they have become me.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.560
Anyway, fall is here and it's the perfect time

28:48.560 --> 28:50.320
to put these cozy essentials to the test.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.800
I really do enjoy me undies quite a bit.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.760
I tell you, I tell you, I wore them up north,

28:55.760 --> 29:00.320
took a trip up north to the northern most regions

29:00.320 --> 29:01.440
of Minnesota.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.080
And these me undies kept my whole business area

29:04.080 --> 29:05.600
completely great.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.240
And they have the lounge pants.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.280
Let's get back to those.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.040
They are made from the same three times softer

29:11.040 --> 29:13.440
than cotton micromodal fabric as their undies.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.640
You can check out their latest jack-o'-lanterns print

29:16.640 --> 29:18.800
in undies, socks, and bralettes.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.800
And they got a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.920
If you don't love them, you can keep them.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.560
They'll refund you.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.600
It's risk-free.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.680
They got a great offer for our listeners too.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.320
For any first-time purchasers, when you purchase any me undies,

29:28.320 --> 29:30.800
you get 15% off and free shipping.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.880
So to get 15% off your first pair of free shipping

29:36.640 --> 29:39.520

29:39.520 --> 29:42.960
I would love to tell you all, share a special message

29:42.960 --> 29:43.440
with you.

29:44.560 --> 29:49.200
And it is from Pops slash Fistmaster.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.720
And it's for Alex, Nick, Olivia, and Jill.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.520
And that's not a great start, but I'm gonna push on through.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.560
Thank you for being my good, good kids.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.000
I am so proud of you and love you so much.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.920
The brothers make life better because they remind me of you,

30:05.920 --> 30:08.000
especially the talking over each other's goose.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.680
Here's to many more years of fun.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.480
That's good, man.

30:11.280 --> 30:11.440
Yep.

30:14.400 --> 30:14.880
Got him.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.120
Here's to many more years of fun and great job.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.080
Sincerely, Fistmaster.

30:22.080 --> 30:22.720
Fuck yeah.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.880
Now, to be fair, that's not a weird nickname.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.920
In the 90s, he was transported to an alternate universe

30:29.920 --> 30:33.440
where he turned out to be the one spoken about in legend

30:33.440 --> 30:34.960
and he was the Fistmaster.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.160
Fistmaster, I've heard of him.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.960
Trav, you wanna read this last one, please?

30:38.960 --> 30:40.000
I sure do.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.760
My voice sounds like a mud bubble.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.960
It's from Taylor and it's for John.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.000
Hi, baby.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.200
Turns out your anxious baby got nervous writing this.

30:49.200 --> 30:52.720
Anyway, life is a drip and I am so lucky to be

30:52.720 --> 30:54.080
writing beside you.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.400
You're a strong, inspirational man.

30:56.400 --> 30:59.520
The very best cat daddy to our very bad beans.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.120
And my best friend.

31:01.120 --> 31:05.600
I can't wait to watch Peezy and Bean grow old with us.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.920
I love you always and unconditionally.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.920
200 mummies.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.480
And then there were 200 mummies.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.800
There's like 200 mummies.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.640
Believe it or not, there's 200 mummies in this one.

31:18.640 --> 31:19.520
Oh, shoot.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.240
The secret is out.

31:22.240 --> 31:26.800
I, Open Mike Eagle, officially had a wrestling match.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.920
And on the next Tights and Fights, I'm talking all about it.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.680
From the rap battles that got us started.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.560
Open Mike, you ain't ready.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.160
Oh, really?

31:36.160 --> 31:37.120
Just call him.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.240
Like something, forget it.

31:39.840 --> 31:43.280
Into how I hurt myself in ways I didn't know I could.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.480
That day and the day before, I got so many texts from people

31:46.480 --> 31:48.160
who really care about me who were like,

31:48.160 --> 31:49.360
please don't break your neck.

31:49.920 --> 31:53.760
The only place you can get the full story is on the newest episode

31:53.760 --> 31:55.520
of Tights and Fights.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.960
Find it on maximumfun.org or wherever you get podcasts.

32:02.160 --> 32:02.960
You know Yahoo?

32:03.520 --> 32:04.960
Yeah, I'd love one.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.800
This is usually the part after we come out of money zone

32:06.800 --> 32:08.000
where you interrupt me a little bit.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.280
Weird.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.720
Nope, not on this one.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.760
Sorry to, sorry to disappoint.

32:15.760 --> 32:16.880
All right, so here's a Yahoo.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.240
This one was sent in by Kyle.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.840
Who was it from again?

32:23.840 --> 32:25.760
Say it slowly this time.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.280
Wait, say it slowly this time.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:28.080 --> 32:28.320
Here.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.000
Folks, it's a haunted doll watch.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.040
What else could it be?

32:33.040 --> 32:35.680
This is coming to us from actually,

32:35.680 --> 32:38.160
this is I think our first repeat seller.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.480
It may be that this has happened before,

32:40.480 --> 32:42.880
but this person's intro is so wild

32:42.880 --> 32:46.240
that I'm happy to welcome back Lacy.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.160
Here's a reminder of Lacy.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.000
Today, I will share my story with you

32:50.000 --> 32:51.360
so you can get to know me.

32:51.360 --> 32:54.400
My name is Lacy, so feel free to call me by my name.

32:54.400 --> 32:58.560
That is like a fucking like mid-90s like hip hop song.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.840
Like stop what you're doing

32:59.840 --> 33:01.680
because I'm about to ruin your day.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.000
I'm Lacy.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.920
Today I'm going to share the story of a scare.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.520
She's in a wonderful coven.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.880
She practices the art of magic.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.120
She lives in harming one,

33:12.720 --> 33:14.080
harming none and helping all.

33:14.720 --> 33:15.600
I said harming one.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.160
It's okay.

33:18.160 --> 33:21.760
Listen, if you get out of this life only harming one, not bad.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.880
I believe in harming Beverly Fitzpatrick

33:24.880 --> 33:27.360
who used to be my friend when we were in third grade.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.040
She knows what she did.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.560
She knows what she did, Beverly.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.560
Huge capsule letters.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.240
This is a tangible item.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.120
Don't get it twisted.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.120
And then right below that it says,

33:40.240 --> 33:45.280
this is a sexual spirit meant for you.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.840
Oh my God, this is not a toy.

33:47.840 --> 33:48.720
Oh my God.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.280
Meant for me?

33:51.280 --> 33:52.720
Meant for you.

33:52.720 --> 33:57.120
My brother that I'm selling a sexual ghost here.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.360
Is it a fucking toy though?

33:59.360 --> 34:00.240
It's not.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.400
It's a tangible sexual spirit.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.520
It says this is a tangible item

34:07.520 --> 34:09.840
and then right below it says it's a sexual spirit.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.280
And Lacy, which is it?

34:11.280 --> 34:14.880
Lacy, Lacy, it can be both.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.560
Justin, it's 2018.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.360
Lacy, which is it?

34:17.360 --> 34:20.640
People can be both tangible items and sexual spirits.

34:20.640 --> 34:24.320
Today I present to you the sexual spirit of Kayla,

34:24.320 --> 34:28.000
a new undiscovered Miles Davis record.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.960
This is a highly erotic spirit.

34:31.760 --> 34:35.360
If you desired a sexual spiritual connection

34:35.360 --> 34:38.160
with another being, I think everybody does.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.640
This spirit is meant for you.

34:40.640 --> 34:47.280
Kayla is of, this is underlined, a very sensual spirit.

34:47.280 --> 34:52.720
Yeah, oh my God, you make it so much worse with each repeated.

34:52.720 --> 34:56.960
If you are not aroused by looking into her eyes,

34:56.960 --> 34:58.400
then read no further.

34:59.040 --> 34:59.680
Let me take a quick check.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.840
Well, okay, hold on, wait, let's pause the podcast.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.400
I'll send you all the legs.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.360
Send me a JPEG, yeah.

35:05.360 --> 35:08.000
Not everybody is gonna be able to continue with this.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.160
We're not all gonna get through to the end of this.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.680
Because some of us are gonna,

35:12.960 --> 35:14.720
if we're following the directions,

35:15.520 --> 35:17.600
some of us are going to have to bail.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.280
But yeah, so we'll just do this.

35:19.280 --> 35:22.000
If you click on the JPEG and you don't get out.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.160
I would love to send you guys a glossy JPEG,

35:24.160 --> 35:28.000
but new Skype is so fucking miserable that I can't even,

35:28.000 --> 35:28.800
here we go.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.400
There is a link to Kayla.

35:31.440 --> 35:34.880
I am having zero erotic reaction to this, my friends.

35:34.880 --> 35:35.920
I wish I could come with you,

35:35.920 --> 35:41.280
but I'm getting, my erotometer is just in the,

35:41.280 --> 35:42.960
completely in the red right now.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.320
There's no activity.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.440
It's completely fair.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.760
I do wanna keep, I'm gonna keep reading

35:47.760 --> 35:48.960
just as a public service,

35:48.960 --> 35:50.160
but I think we've all established

35:50.160 --> 35:51.280
this is not for any of us.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.080
This is not any of our king.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.880
It might just specifically be for Dan Aykroyd.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.840
And I know we've already referenced him once this episode

35:59.840 --> 36:01.280
and might again.

36:01.280 --> 36:01.520
Yeah.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.160
It just feels appropriate.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.960
Well, we referenced his character in Ghostbusters.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.280
But this is for Dan the man.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.800
Dan the human man.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.160
This spirit will provide you

36:10.160 --> 36:13.040
with an intense sexual attachment.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.440
You will feel Kayla in any room you are in.

36:17.440 --> 36:20.240
I mean, after you buy her, I guess that's your right.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.720
You will follow, she will follow you around.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.360
She is at your beckoned call.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.400
That's not.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.360
That's not it.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.800
That's not what you meant to say.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.040
She will exist to pleasure you.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.800
This is starting to yuck me out,

36:32.800 --> 36:34.480
but I'm gonna push on forward.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.680
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:35.680 --> 36:36.240
It's starting to.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.840
Now is the time where the yuck.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.840
Just from a power dynamics perspective,

36:39.840 --> 36:41.920
like I want Kayla to be a real person.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.680
And if we have a strong sexual connection,

36:43.680 --> 36:44.960
that's like great.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.880
But I also wanted her to be able to pursue

36:46.880 --> 36:47.840
her other interests.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.800
She is ready for you anytime.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.480
All you have to do is call her

36:52.480 --> 36:55.600
and she will be there to pleasure you.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.160
Oh, no.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.840
She's a doll.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.720
It sucks so bad.

36:58.720 --> 37:02.640
It sucks so bad that she's a little doll.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.080
She will appear to you telepathically as a young woman.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.320
Well, you're assuming a lot all of a sudden,

37:08.320 --> 37:09.600
aren't you, Lacy?

37:09.600 --> 37:11.280
Maybe that's not my fucking thing.

37:11.840 --> 37:14.080
She'll be in the body of a 20-year-old.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.920
She has long, dark hair.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.200
She will be wearing only a long T-shirt.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.720
I gotta say, man,

37:20.720 --> 37:22.480
usually with these listings,

37:22.480 --> 37:24.080
it's always about like,

37:25.600 --> 37:26.800
it's always about like,

37:28.000 --> 37:32.240
you'll feel a general sort of spirit

37:32.240 --> 37:36.000
of Lacy's giving you the fucking Craigslist ad, right?

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
Like, this is her exact description

37:40.000 --> 37:42.160
and clothes guarantee.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.520
It's so oddly that she'll be wearing a long T-shirt

37:45.520 --> 37:47.600
with an off-brand Barton Simpson on it.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.400
Right, exactly.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.960
She'll be wearing just a left sock and a slat brace.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.800
She'll be wearing a big dog T-shirt

37:54.800 --> 37:56.080
she stole from your uncle.

37:59.520 --> 38:01.920
She won't get the reference and neither will you.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.920
She will be in the body of a 20-year-old.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.520
She has long, dark hair.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.600
She will only be wearing a long T-shirt.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.280
She will fall into your arms.

38:09.280 --> 38:13.040
You will catch her and feel her body brushing against you.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.560
Well, I might catch her.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.400
Maybe, I got shit to do today.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.040
She only wants to satisfy you.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.240
She will whisper into your ear.

38:22.240 --> 38:25.680
She will speak to you in her soft voice.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.400
She will nip at your neck.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.840
She will be ready.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.160
You will dream of Kayla often.

38:32.160 --> 38:37.120
You will feel her arms around you at all times.

38:37.120 --> 38:41.680
This is not a normal sexual spirit.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.320
You can't just walk into any fucking Costco

38:46.320 --> 38:49.280
and buy a regular sexual spirit.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.120
She's not like the others.

38:51.120 --> 38:51.840
She's special.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.120
She's very active.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.160
Artisanal.

38:54.160 --> 38:54.640
She is.

38:54.640 --> 38:55.280
I keep waiting.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.120
I feel like there should be a twist here

38:57.120 --> 38:59.200
and that's when she'll turn on you.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.520
Like this is, where's the twist?

39:01.520 --> 39:06.960
She's one of the more active sexual spirits in my collection.

39:06.960 --> 39:12.000
So Lacy's keeping the real nasty birds back for herself,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.560
you see, but she is pretty nasty.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.440
Can I give it up?

39:15.440 --> 39:18.000
Her only wish is to make you feel pleasure.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.400
She is a very talkative spirit.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.520
She will only speak if you desire to speak with her.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.040
If you do want a conversation,

39:25.040 --> 39:27.840
she communicates best through dousing and pendulum.

39:27.840 --> 39:32.160
How's your relationship going Justin?

39:32.160 --> 39:32.880
Pretty good.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.160
We communicate mainly through dousing and pendulum.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.520
It gets me rock hard.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.600
It gets me rock hard and she's always ready

39:39.600 --> 39:41.920
and she's always in the same big dog's t-shirt

39:41.920 --> 39:43.120
she stole from my uncle.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.440
If you're in need of a pendulum,

39:45.440 --> 39:47.040
I have them available at my store.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.360
Damn Lacy, you thought of everything.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.960
You can view them by clicking here.

39:52.960 --> 39:58.080
Can you imagine buying this sexual spirit?

39:58.080 --> 40:00.400
It's like there's got to be some way we could talk.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.920
Anyway, I can't think of anything.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.960
I am a reputable seller and I have been for years,

40:04.960 --> 40:07.520
which is something that reputable sellers always say

40:07.520 --> 40:08.880
in my experience.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.800
All my items are authentic and you will get a tangible item.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.960
You'll be extremely satisfied with this purchase.

40:14.960 --> 40:18.080
I combine this spirit doll to you free of charge

40:18.080 --> 40:20.720
so the magic can begin working before arrival.

40:20.720 --> 40:26.000
Okay, so what Lacy is saying is she'll do a spell on this doll

40:26.000 --> 40:29.200
to make a horny spirit fly across the country

40:29.200 --> 40:31.280
and it goes faster than UPS could do it

40:31.280 --> 40:33.600
because I need this sexy spirit now.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.760
I will be sending a free gift along with Kayla,

40:35.760 --> 40:38.320
which does not seem sinister in the slightest.

40:38.320 --> 40:42.160
She's not a pendulum though.

40:42.160 --> 40:45.760
You're gonna fork out for that baby?

40:45.760 --> 40:48.160
She's a beautiful spirit and will make a great addition

40:48.160 --> 40:52.480
to anyone's family who's open to the paranormal.

40:52.480 --> 40:56.560
And I would hasten to say pretty much anything, huh, Lacy?

40:58.160 --> 41:02.640
Who in reading this listing got to that line

41:02.640 --> 41:05.520
and would be like, well, I'm not open to the paranormal.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.520
Like that was the deal breaker for them.

41:07.520 --> 41:12.960
All caps, red text, italics, exclamation points, larger font.

41:12.960 --> 41:18.480
Authentic, spirit, magical, powerful.

41:18.480 --> 41:23.280
And then just when you're about to nut.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.520
Per eBay's policy, I must state that I am not to be held

41:27.520 --> 41:29.280
responsible for any paranormal experiences

41:29.280 --> 41:30.960
that may or may not happen.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.840
You're betting on a tangible.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.880
All right, just when I'm about to go nuts.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.720
It's like, but it could not happen.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.120
I don't think that eBay,

41:41.120 --> 41:43.920
I understand why Lacy has phrased it to say,

41:44.560 --> 41:47.120
I'm not responsible for any paranormal occurrences

41:47.120 --> 41:50.080
that may or may not happen per eBay's policy.

41:51.280 --> 41:52.800
Yeah, they're taking some liberties.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.200
I'm pretty sure that eBay's policy is not

41:55.840 --> 41:59.040
if an item you buy on eBay has a ghost in it,

41:59.040 --> 42:01.840
it's not the seller's fault.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.000
Like I'm pretty sure eBay doesn't specify

42:04.640 --> 42:08.480
that ghost items are not the fault of the seller.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.480
I'm pretty sure it's just the other one.

42:10.480 --> 42:14.640
Yeah, I bought this vintage Mickey Mouse clock

42:14.640 --> 42:17.760
off of your eBay site and it's haunted.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.040
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

42:21.040 --> 42:25.840
Per eBay's policy, ghosts attached to the item

42:25.840 --> 42:28.080
are not the responsibility of the seller.

42:28.080 --> 42:30.640
So I guess.

42:30.640 --> 42:33.200
As always, I'd like to close this haunted dog segment

42:33.200 --> 42:34.560
the way I always do by saying,

42:34.560 --> 42:36.640
if you're the person at eBay that takes calls

42:36.640 --> 42:38.720
about shit not being haunted enough,

42:38.720 --> 42:41.200
please give us a buzz.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.920
Would love to hear from you

42:43.920 --> 42:45.200
even though you got the disclaimer,

42:45.200 --> 42:47.120
I'm betting your phone is still ringing

42:47.120 --> 42:48.480
off the proverbial hook.

42:48.480 --> 42:51.120
And I would love to just touch base real quick.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.080
Whatever you need a second.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.800
Just a couple anonymous transcripts

42:54.800 --> 42:58.000
from those calls would just be top notch.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.120
Just so dope.

42:59.920 --> 43:00.480
Real good.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.360
We'll put the monster voice filter on it

43:03.360 --> 43:05.440
before we put it on our podcast for sure.

43:06.080 --> 43:06.960
Do you want a Yahoo?

43:07.920 --> 43:08.480
Yes.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.760
This one was sent in by Griffin,

43:09.760 --> 43:10.640
but a different one.

43:10.640 --> 43:11.280
Thank you, Griffin.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.640
It's Yahoo Answers user.

43:12.640 --> 43:13.840
They're anonymous.

43:13.840 --> 43:14.640
I'm gonna call them.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.720
Munchie asks,

43:17.280 --> 43:19.600
Halloween prank, what would happen if I did this?

43:20.320 --> 43:21.680
Say that on Halloween night,

43:21.680 --> 43:23.760
I keep several open cans of creamed corn

43:23.760 --> 43:25.040
by my front door.

43:25.040 --> 43:26.480
And every time I get a trick or treater,

43:26.480 --> 43:27.280
I open the door,

43:27.280 --> 43:29.200
quickly dump the can of creamed corn

43:29.200 --> 43:30.240
into their bag of candy,

43:30.240 --> 43:32.240
then shut the door no words ever spoken.

43:33.840 --> 43:34.800
What would come of that?

43:35.920 --> 43:37.200
I think you'd be arrested.

43:37.200 --> 43:37.920
Why?

43:38.880 --> 43:40.400
It's definitely illegal.

43:40.400 --> 43:40.960
Why?

43:42.160 --> 43:42.720
Why?

43:42.720 --> 43:43.200
Huh.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.040
Because you'd be,

43:45.680 --> 43:49.040
you'd be ruining children's candy in evenings.

43:50.160 --> 43:50.640
I don't know.

43:50.640 --> 43:51.840
It's a trick, motherfucker.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.400
It's not a good one, though.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.600
It's a great one.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.960
It counteracts all the treats.

43:56.960 --> 43:59.440
It's a trick that negates every treat

43:59.440 --> 44:00.640
they've received up to that point.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.080
It's a pretty good trick.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.320
I mean, I guess.

44:04.320 --> 44:06.160
It's not the most creative.

44:06.160 --> 44:06.640
Creative.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.800
What would you do then?

44:08.800 --> 44:09.840
Really trick them?

44:09.840 --> 44:10.320
Yeah.

44:10.320 --> 44:11.840
Maybe like distract them

44:11.840 --> 44:13.600
and then swap their bag of candy

44:13.600 --> 44:15.520
for just a bag full of creamed corn.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.560
So then you get the candy.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.000
Then I get the candy.

44:20.000 --> 44:20.880
And you know what?

44:20.880 --> 44:23.120
Maybe I just leave the creamed corn in the can too

44:23.120 --> 44:24.560
and I just give them a bag

44:24.560 --> 44:26.240
with a can of creamed corn in it.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.600
That they'll use to just beat you to shit with.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.040
No, the door's closed.

44:31.040 --> 44:31.760
All right.

44:31.760 --> 44:32.480
They can't get me.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.840
I'm never leaving my house again.

44:33.840 --> 44:34.160
Never.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.480
I have enough candy to live off the rest of my life.

44:36.480 --> 44:36.960
Yeah.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.560
Enjoy the Garmin Bosia, kids.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.920
I think it'd be funny.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.480
It'd be, I mean, it'd be so bad, right?

44:44.480 --> 44:47.200
But like, I love that like bad humor.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.040
Like me, myself, Irene humor.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.000
Like that bad.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Like they shouldn't be doing that.

44:52.000 --> 44:52.800
Do you know what I mean?

44:52.800 --> 44:54.000
The raunchy stuff.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Like the super raunchy.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.200
Something about Mary when he comes.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.160
It's like so bad and it shouldn't be happening.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.600
Griffin, this one's gonna take you back.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.400
Is that hair gel?

45:05.280 --> 45:05.520
Yeah.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.440
Here's the thing.

45:08.960 --> 45:09.920
Try to let him have it.

45:09.920 --> 45:10.400
Let him go.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.840
It's me, the Crip Keeper.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.280
I wrote that joke.

45:13.280 --> 45:13.600
What?

45:13.600 --> 45:14.320
All right.

45:14.320 --> 45:14.880
Yeah, he wrote the-

45:14.880 --> 45:15.760
You did?

45:15.760 --> 45:17.920
I wrote all of something about Mary.

45:18.560 --> 45:19.120
Wow.

45:19.120 --> 45:20.560
Except I called it.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.560
There's something about scary.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.400
Uh-huh.

45:24.400 --> 45:27.120
Hey, Crip Keeper, that doesn't make any fucking sense, bud.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.440
There's two things about scare.

45:30.560 --> 45:31.040
Okay.

45:31.600 --> 45:32.240
All right.

45:32.240 --> 45:34.560
But it doesn't make any sense, right?

45:34.560 --> 45:38.160
I called it scare's tomb thing about scary.

45:38.960 --> 45:39.680
Yeah.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.280
We also had an extended aboot.

45:42.720 --> 45:45.360
So scare's tomb thing, aboot, scary.

45:48.480 --> 45:49.600
I think that's all of them.

45:50.320 --> 45:53.360
Scare's swamp thing, aboot, scary.

45:55.360 --> 45:59.120
It's a fucking bad podcast.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.240
People have been listening to this podcast for almost a decade.

46:02.240 --> 46:07.680
I'm just saying the hit film scare's swamp thing, aboot, scary.

46:10.640 --> 46:10.960
Yes.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.840
It's the perfect joke.

46:13.840 --> 46:14.640
It's a Halloween.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.240
It was a horror comedy.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.440
There's nothing wrong with that.

46:20.800 --> 46:22.480
With Cameron Diaz.

46:23.520 --> 46:24.960
Like, oh, shit.

46:24.960 --> 46:26.400
I did one too many, didn't I?

46:27.520 --> 46:28.880
I have too many questions to get through.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.120
I know that we barely touched on that yahoo, but I got to move on.

46:31.120 --> 46:31.520
Hey, bros.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.400
No, please.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.400
I never dressed up for Halloween.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.680
Super religious parents.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.480
But this year is my year.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.440
My wife and I have an invite to a Halloween party.

46:41.440 --> 46:46.320
And we also have all the components for the perfect Bob and Linda Belcher costume.

46:46.320 --> 46:50.720
The only issue is that I've had a beard for three years now.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.520
And this costume would require shaving down to just the mustache.

46:53.520 --> 46:58.320
My question, is it worth shaving away all my hard work for my first ever Halloween costume?

46:58.320 --> 47:00.480
That's from Spooky Stache in Surrey.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.280
Why don't we lightning round through these last questions?

47:03.280 --> 47:04.000
Because Justin's right.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.960
We are not going to come back to these ever.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.320
For sure, for sure, for sure.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.160
They are Halloween themed.

47:10.160 --> 47:15.200
I am going to say, probably not because it's one night out of the year and your beard is

47:15.200 --> 47:17.920
going to take you a while to get back, I think.

47:17.920 --> 47:24.480
Halloween costumes are about having fun and like playing dress up.

47:24.480 --> 47:27.600
They're not about, and maybe you don't know this because you haven't done it before.

47:27.600 --> 47:31.600
It's not about tricking your friends into thinking you're the beloved burger man.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.600
Like, they're not going to be fooled.

47:33.600 --> 47:34.960
They'll know it's you.

47:34.960 --> 47:38.640
So you don't have to make it a complete fabricate, a complete ruse.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.880
You don't have to be in character all night, I guess is what I'm saying.

47:41.680 --> 47:45.760
The Halloween police aren't going to send you home because you didn't do it.

47:45.760 --> 47:51.280
Now, if you're going to go compete in like some sort of Halloween competition, maybe.

47:51.280 --> 47:52.080
What's the prize?

47:52.880 --> 47:56.080
I mean, I said I was doing David S. Pumpkins earlier, but really, I'm just putting on a

47:56.080 --> 47:57.360
nice blue suit that I own.

47:58.800 --> 48:01.040
And then I'll say his favorite stuff.

48:01.040 --> 48:05.680
What's the worst laziest Halloween costume everybody here has ever done?

48:05.680 --> 48:09.760
Where it's like, still, you try to do a costume, but it's like, it's just bad.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.640
You did a bad job.

48:11.520 --> 48:12.800
I've never done a bad job.

48:12.800 --> 48:13.200
Okay.

48:13.200 --> 48:16.800
I put on a striped sweater and I said, I am Harry Potter.

48:16.800 --> 48:19.120
I broke a stick while I was on my way to the party.

48:19.120 --> 48:19.760
This is not a joke.

48:19.760 --> 48:22.880
I broke a stick off of a tree and that was my wand.

48:23.440 --> 48:24.400
It was awesome.

48:25.360 --> 48:31.520
I once wore a green pair of ladies sweatpants and a white dress shirt and said I was Peter Griffin.

48:32.080 --> 48:32.880
I remember that.

48:33.440 --> 48:36.960
It was not a good costume, but it was dark time for all of us.

48:36.960 --> 48:37.680
Good sweatpants.

48:38.240 --> 48:38.960
They were good sweatpants.

48:38.960 --> 48:41.840
See, I've done Dexter and I did a good job.

48:41.840 --> 48:44.000
I did Quailman and I did a good job.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.280
I've done Wolverine.

48:45.280 --> 48:45.520
Yes.

48:45.520 --> 48:46.000
Quailman.

48:46.880 --> 48:49.200
You know, the best thing Sid and I ever did was Phil and Lil.

48:49.200 --> 48:50.000
Those are adorable.

48:50.000 --> 48:50.560
That was good.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.760
They were good costumes.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.440
Anyway, let's move on.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.160
I hope that helps.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.360
Just keep your beard.

48:55.360 --> 48:56.560
Don't shave your beard.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.880
I work at a scare farm.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.040
Is that a pun or?

49:01.040 --> 49:04.640
Scare farm is probably like a haunted house, but more rural.

49:04.640 --> 49:05.120
Got it.

49:05.120 --> 49:08.320
Every year where I get to run around and terrify children and adults alike.

49:08.320 --> 49:11.360
But every year without fail, there are a couple of people that end up fighting

49:11.360 --> 49:13.840
rather than fleeing upon being spooked.

49:13.840 --> 49:14.800
So dope.

49:14.800 --> 49:17.360
How should I prepare myself for these situations?

49:17.360 --> 49:19.760
And what types of defense tactics should I employ

49:19.760 --> 49:22.320
when dealing with the easily scared common folk?

49:22.320 --> 49:25.280
That's from Bloodcurdling and Bruised in Branchburg.

49:26.160 --> 49:27.040
So awesome.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.480
It's so awesome.

49:28.480 --> 49:29.360
Oh, it's a mummy.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.320
A real mummy.

49:30.320 --> 49:31.040
I got him.

49:31.040 --> 49:31.760
Punch, punch, punch.

49:32.320 --> 49:32.880
Oh, shoot.

49:32.880 --> 49:33.520
That's right.

49:34.240 --> 49:34.800
Oh, no.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.480
That was just a 20 year old.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.200
Damn it.

49:37.200 --> 49:39.360
Do they go see Lion King on Broadway and they're like,

49:39.360 --> 49:41.520
everybody get the fuck out of here.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.080
That's a hyena.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.120
To wild animals.

49:44.240 --> 49:48.000
I've only been struck once doing some spooks.

49:49.040 --> 49:50.480
And I was doing a haunted house.

49:50.480 --> 49:54.240
So I worked with this company that set up haunted houses at people's houses.

49:55.280 --> 49:59.360
And they did it for this like seven year old's birthday

49:59.360 --> 50:01.760
that happened to be like three days before Halloween.

50:02.480 --> 50:06.560
And so it was like the same 10 kids and they all came through the party

50:06.560 --> 50:08.320
of the haunted house over and over again.

50:08.320 --> 50:12.880
And so I was just like sitting in a fake electric chair like doing like a jump scare.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.200
And this little girl just came through.

50:15.200 --> 50:18.320
I jumped, she stared at me for like five seconds

50:18.320 --> 50:20.800
and then hauled off and smacked me across the face.

50:20.800 --> 50:21.200
Whoa.

50:21.200 --> 50:25.120
And I instantly turned back into an adult and I was like, how dare you?

50:25.120 --> 50:26.800
And she like ran away.

50:26.800 --> 50:30.960
It was, and I never did a haunted house ever again after that.

50:30.960 --> 50:35.040
I guess it's a good reminder that like, you're not so tough.

50:35.040 --> 50:37.040
You may be like Mr. Scare.

50:37.040 --> 50:37.680
Oh, I see.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.520
Mr. Scare that night.

50:39.520 --> 50:42.560
But like, people will still fight.

50:43.920 --> 50:44.960
People can still fight you.

50:44.960 --> 50:45.920
I guess that's what I'm saying.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.280
So we should be careful.

50:48.320 --> 50:48.960
And you know what?

50:48.960 --> 50:53.040
That's also a pretty like hopeful message for humanity of like,

50:53.040 --> 50:56.320
yeah, it'll be scary when like the army of vampires attacks,

50:56.320 --> 50:58.240
but some of us will fight back.

50:58.240 --> 50:59.920
Listen, some of us will run.

50:59.920 --> 51:02.560
And as I'm sure I've discussed in this podcast before,

51:02.560 --> 51:05.440
the time I got scared by a werewolf, I did run away.

51:05.440 --> 51:07.760
And listen, I'm a runner.

51:07.760 --> 51:08.240
I get it.

51:08.240 --> 51:13.520
You have done your part, I think, in keeping these like modern day Spartans,

51:13.520 --> 51:17.280
keeping their instincts honed to a razor's edge.

51:18.480 --> 51:22.640
So when the real creature for the Black Lagoon shows up,

51:23.360 --> 51:24.480
this guy will be ready.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.080
He'll have practiced on you.

51:26.080 --> 51:28.720
So he'll be ready to save your bacon and you'll appreciate it.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.220
Yeah.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.400
That's what you should do is like mark them in some way

51:32.400 --> 51:34.960
and then have someone outside of the haunted house when they get out.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.640
They're just like, I see you're a fighter.

51:36.640 --> 51:37.680
Come with me, son.

51:37.680 --> 51:41.440
I'm going to recruit you to a very special like organization.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.120
You're going to help me fight monsters.

51:43.120 --> 51:45.040
But then really, you just like, I don't know,

51:45.040 --> 51:46.400
sue them for striking an employee.

51:46.400 --> 51:48.880
I want to recruit you to a very special well over here

51:48.880 --> 51:50.880
that I'm going to put you into because you're a dingus.

51:51.840 --> 51:52.960
Travis makes a great point.

51:52.960 --> 51:55.840
If you're being struck, that is still a crime.

51:55.840 --> 51:58.640
Like a haunted house is still a house.

51:58.640 --> 52:00.080
And in house, you can still do crime.

52:00.080 --> 52:00.560
You know what I mean?

52:00.560 --> 52:05.200
Like we don't suspend, we don't suspend our laws just because

52:05.200 --> 52:06.560
we're trying to LARP a little bit.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.120
You know what I mean?

52:07.120 --> 52:08.080
Why did you hit that person?

52:08.080 --> 52:09.360
Well, he was dressed like a werewolf.

52:09.360 --> 52:10.640
OK, but werewolves aren't real.

52:10.640 --> 52:11.680
So that was a guy.

52:11.680 --> 52:12.960
So it was a guy.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.400
You hit him.

52:14.400 --> 52:15.520
Please follow me to jail.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.120
This way to jail.

52:19.280 --> 52:20.480
I want to dress up for Halloween.

52:20.480 --> 52:22.560
Walk behind me, honor system.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.960
I want to dress up for Halloween, but my office at my new job

52:24.960 --> 52:27.200
doesn't seem to celebrate the holiday at all.

52:27.200 --> 52:29.840
How much of my Hogwarts uniform can I put on before it stops

52:29.840 --> 52:31.440
being business casual?

52:31.440 --> 52:32.320
That's from Bailey.

52:33.360 --> 52:36.640
I can say anecdotally, if you put on some jeans and a striped

52:36.640 --> 52:39.920
sweatshirt with a stick, people aren't going to know

52:39.920 --> 52:41.280
you're Harry Potter.

52:41.280 --> 52:44.160
So that much approximately.

52:44.160 --> 52:46.720
What if just like every time the boss walked by,

52:47.360 --> 52:48.880
you were a little more magical?

52:48.880 --> 52:49.520
Oh, I see.

52:49.520 --> 52:50.160
I like that.

52:50.160 --> 52:50.400
Yeah.

52:50.960 --> 52:54.880
So over time, the boss walks by at like four fifty five

52:54.880 --> 52:58.160
and the boss is like, have they always been Hermione?

52:58.160 --> 53:01.440
Have they always been Hermione?

53:01.440 --> 53:02.880
Where did they get the owl from?

53:03.760 --> 53:04.880
What the fuck's going on?

53:04.880 --> 53:06.000
Have you always had an owl?

53:06.000 --> 53:06.480
Yep.

53:06.480 --> 53:08.880
Hey, have you always been Voldemort?

53:08.880 --> 53:10.880
Yeah, I have always been Voldemort.

53:10.880 --> 53:11.520
You know this.

53:11.520 --> 53:11.920
Always.

53:12.880 --> 53:15.040
We talked about this at my quarterly review.

53:15.040 --> 53:17.520
Have you always been a ghost that lives in the bathroom?

53:18.160 --> 53:19.040
Yes, I have.

53:19.040 --> 53:19.200
Yep.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.080
There's always been a crying bathroom ghost at your office.

53:25.680 --> 53:26.240
Last one.

53:26.240 --> 53:29.440
Okay, so for Halloween, I'm going as a skeleton with a jack-o'-lantern mask.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.400
Fuck that's scary.

53:30.960 --> 53:34.240
But the onesie my mom got me is just so apparently crunchy.

53:39.440 --> 53:42.480
Like I just slightly move my arm and the fabric paint that was used

53:42.480 --> 53:45.040
to paint on the bones just crunches so loud.

53:46.000 --> 53:46.960
Did I fix this?

53:47.760 --> 53:49.280
Can I make it not so annoying?

53:50.080 --> 53:53.280
Can I try to make it sound like the crunchiness is on purpose?

53:54.080 --> 53:55.280
That's from Matt.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.000
Thank you, Matt.

53:56.720 --> 53:57.200
Matt?

53:57.200 --> 54:00.960
You just have to jump out and say like, I'm the crunchy ghost.

54:00.960 --> 54:01.920
Yeah, crunchy.

54:03.120 --> 54:06.640
You're essentially able to scare in two senses.

54:06.640 --> 54:11.600
And I think you could rub some stinky onion or blood smell on yourself.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.120
Go for a hat trick.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.280
Maybe like a bitter taste?

54:15.280 --> 54:16.480
A bitter taste, like a spray.

54:16.480 --> 54:18.800
In case anyone accidentally licks you.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.520
Or just a bitter spray that you put on people.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.920
And then what feels scary?

54:23.920 --> 54:26.000
Ooh, you could say like, trick or treat, close your eyes.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.040
I'm going to do like the egg on your head and spiders crawling up your back.

54:31.040 --> 54:32.720
Spiders crawling down your back.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.200
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.480
Thank you so much for joining us.

54:36.480 --> 54:40.320
We hope you're going to have a very spooky Halloween time.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.120
And a safe Halloween time.

54:43.120 --> 54:43.760
Next week.

54:45.120 --> 54:48.560
We definitely have an episode that's going to go out before Halloween.

54:50.080 --> 54:50.480
Oh.

54:50.480 --> 54:51.040
Travis.

54:51.920 --> 54:52.720
Why is this a Halloween?

54:52.720 --> 54:55.120
You know what, timing wise, I guess you're right.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.120
I wanted to have more of a build up to it.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.680
So people could listen to this over and over again.

54:59.680 --> 55:03.120
We definitely can't do another Halloween episode on the 29th.

55:03.120 --> 55:04.400
You know what you've condemned us to?

55:04.400 --> 55:06.160
We have to do a Christmas episode next week.

55:07.280 --> 55:08.080
That's what you've done.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.040
How could you do this?

55:12.240 --> 55:15.040
That literally just occurred to me for the first time, as I'm saying it.

55:15.040 --> 55:16.000
I know, it's astonishing.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.480
It actually occurred to me yesterday and I still went ahead with it.

55:18.480 --> 55:20.000
Because I've already gotten the questions ready.

55:20.000 --> 55:20.480
You monstrous.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.280
Yes, thank you so much for listening.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.320
Happy Halloween.

55:24.320 --> 55:24.960
Yeah, I guess so.

55:26.480 --> 55:28.160
In 10 days.

55:28.160 --> 55:34.480
Yeah, if you want to be the hit of the neighborhood, you should go to Amazon

55:34.480 --> 55:41.040
and buy enough copies of the Sawbones book to give to all the different trick or traders

55:41.040 --> 55:41.840
that are going to show up.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.480
I'd really appreciate it if you buy that.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.560
And if you already buy it, please review it.

55:46.560 --> 55:49.680
My wife, Sydney McElroy, and I worked really hard on it.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.360
And we hope you really enjoy it.

55:51.360 --> 55:57.120
And also go ahead and go to theadventurezonecomic.com and pre-order the second book.

55:57.120 --> 56:00.080
Enough copies to give next Halloween.

56:01.520 --> 56:04.800
For that second book of the graphic novel, Murder on the Rockport Limited.

56:05.360 --> 56:05.920
It's great.

56:07.120 --> 56:08.560
And we think you're going to love it.

56:09.520 --> 56:14.880
This isn't a plug, but just wanted to remind everyone that election day is November 6th.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.400
Please get out and vote.

56:16.400 --> 56:19.440
You can get an absentee ballot or vote by mail.

56:19.440 --> 56:24.880
There's also, like, I think Lyft and Uber are running deals where they will get you

56:24.880 --> 56:26.800
to the polling place and back.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.400
And there's a lot of different options.

56:28.400 --> 56:29.760
So please get out and vote.

56:30.400 --> 56:31.120
Vote or die.

56:31.760 --> 56:32.480
Remember that, guys?

56:33.040 --> 56:33.840
Do you remember that?

56:33.840 --> 56:34.560
Damn.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.080
He was like, here's your two choices.

56:36.080 --> 56:37.760
You can vote or you can die.

56:38.560 --> 56:40.880
Why was that the name of the thing, huh?

56:40.880 --> 56:42.960
Yeah, it's a good question.

56:42.960 --> 56:46.640
Do you guys want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

56:46.640 --> 56:48.320
instead of part drop the album putting the days to bed?

56:48.320 --> 56:49.040
Yeah, thank you.

56:49.040 --> 56:49.760
Absolutely.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.560
Check out all the other amazing shows on MaximumFun.org.

56:52.560 --> 56:59.360
Oh, also, I think Sawbones has a book signing coming up on the 27th in Charleston at Books

56:59.360 --> 56:59.760
a Million.

56:59.760 --> 57:01.840
Yeah, it's the Dudley Farms Plaza Books a Million.

57:03.200 --> 57:06.560
If you want to get your book signed or whatever signed, you just got to buy a copy of the book

57:06.560 --> 57:08.560
on the day of at that locale.

57:08.560 --> 57:09.600
I am such a dummy.

57:09.600 --> 57:10.640
We almost forgot.

57:10.640 --> 57:12.480
So we're starting a macro day newsletter.

57:12.480 --> 57:12.800
Thank you.

57:12.800 --> 57:13.360
Oh, yes.

57:13.360 --> 57:13.920
Yes.

57:13.920 --> 57:17.200
Because we keep having more and more stuff that we're working on.

57:17.200 --> 57:20.800
And stuff falls through the cracks and we don't want it to end up being like a 10 minute plug

57:20.800 --> 57:22.000
at the end of every episode.

57:22.000 --> 57:28.720
So if you go to bit.ly slash McElroy Mail, M-A-I-L, and I don't know why I keep feeling

57:28.720 --> 57:34.480
the need to clarify that, but McElroy Mail, you can sign up for that newsletter and you'll

57:34.480 --> 57:41.200
get a lot of information that you'll only see there, including the date and link and

57:41.200 --> 57:43.440
stuff for the Candle Night Show.

57:43.440 --> 57:48.000
I'm sure we'll announce it later, but you'll see it first in the newsletter.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.680
So if you go to bit.ly slash McElroy Mail, you can sign up for it.

57:52.640 --> 57:56.320
And it's not a pyramid scheme, even though people keep talking about that.

57:56.320 --> 57:58.960
I don't know where that got started, but it is not a pyramid scheme.

57:58.960 --> 58:02.960
It's just a regular mailing list that's not in any way, shape, or form a pyramid scheme.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.920
Here's that final sent in by Michelle.

58:05.920 --> 58:06.640
Thank you, Michelle.

58:06.640 --> 58:07.920
It's Yahoo Answers user.

58:09.600 --> 58:11.600
Come on, load.

58:11.600 --> 58:12.100
Load.

58:13.760 --> 58:14.260
Load.

58:15.520 --> 58:16.020
Damn it.

58:19.520 --> 58:20.640
It's from Yahoo Answers.

58:20.640 --> 58:22.320
No, it's from Yahoo Answers user.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.360
I'll call him Cedric.

58:24.480 --> 58:28.640
Cedric asks, does Oscar the Grouch have legs?

58:28.640 --> 58:30.960
And furthermore, a ding-a-ling.

58:39.360 --> 58:40.880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.080
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

58:42.080 --> 59:11.120
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.280
One, two, one, two, three, four.

59:15.280 --> 59:15.760
Hi, everybody.

59:15.760 --> 59:17.440
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:17.440 --> 59:18.560
And I'm Sydney McElroy.

59:18.560 --> 59:22.560
And together, we're the hosts of Sawbones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

59:22.560 --> 59:25.280
What does that mean for you, the podcast consumer?

59:25.280 --> 59:28.720
Well, it means that you're going to get a lot of stories about how we used to do

59:28.720 --> 59:31.760
weird stuff to people in order to try to fix them.

59:32.400 --> 59:35.280
Do you know that we used to think diseases were caused by bad smells

59:35.920 --> 59:38.720
and that we used to eat mummies for medicine?

59:38.720 --> 59:40.640
That's super funny.

59:40.640 --> 59:42.560
I kind of like it.

59:42.560 --> 59:43.200
Well, thanks.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.520
And we hope you'll kind of like our show,

59:45.520 --> 59:48.640
Sawbones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

59:48.640 --> 59:52.560
It's available every Friday wherever fine podcasts are sold

59:52.560 --> 59:56.000

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.000
All right.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Yeah.
