00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind, on the first in line Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
It's time right now to slow it down, put a little soul in your bowl

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
If you want the very best in your life

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
That is correct

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
He has a new microphone

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Do you like that? Do you like this people?

01:05.000 --> 01:15.000
We decided the smartest thing to spend your money on that you bought the t-shirts is to put it back into My Brother, My Brother and Me

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
So it's like you're not lining our pockets, you're lining your ear meat

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
So we spent $300 on new microphones and the other $300 we're gonna spend to get Eddie Murphy on the show

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
For just one episode

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Just one episode, guest spot, nothing off limits, no rules

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
You would think $300 wouldn't be enough to net a performance by Axel Foley but I guess he's falling on hard times

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
It's plenty to get for Pluto Nash

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
You know what I'm saying? Meet Dave Cash, those residuals just aren't what he hoped they would be

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I don't understand why Hanan Mansion wasn't as big as I thought it would be

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I'm Griffin McElroy by the way, you guys didn't let me

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
There's a reason

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Look at Travis using the power of his microphone to silence others

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
That's right

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
What do you guys say we just chill this show?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Just take it easy right?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Just hang out

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, let's do a couple easy questions first, some slow balls

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
First let me take off my pants, hold on

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Okay

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Thank God he has a new microphone that we can listen to it in perfect audio quality

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Alright, ready to go

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
This is for FormSpring, I have a mane of hair that helps break the ice with nearly everyone I meet

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Jesus man, what kind of product are you putting in your hair?

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Hey, my drink is warmer than it was, you broke all my ice

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Lots of people recognize me because of it

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
But I want a job, and looking the way I do, no one will employ me

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Should I sacrifice popularity for a job or remain penniless yet cool?

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
There's nothing cool about being penniless

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
I've never seen a homeless man with a great head of hair

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah, no one's like, hey, the moths in your hair are really sexy, you seem like a cool guy

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
What is that, bubble gum? I like that, looks nice

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
In your nose? You're a hobo

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Listen, I think there's a way to have your cake and eat it too

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
There have got to be jobs out there that you can find employ at while being so hirsute

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
You could join Rusted Root, you could become a permanent member of the band Rusted Root

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
You could work as a bouncer at your local hookah bar

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
You could become a barista at an independent coffee shop

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
No, they frown on that shit

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
They don't want your face pubes in a macchiato

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
How did this come from he has a big head of hair and he has face pubes?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I took it like a beard too

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
When he says mane, I'm thinking like a lion's mane going all the way around his head

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
You think when you read mane, it's like rapping beats

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
When you read mane, you think he's got a ring of hair around his head like a lion

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, like a lion

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
How did you get to be as old as you are and not know what things are?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
You don't know things that are things about them

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
You don't know the things

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I don't leave the house that much

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Justin, that kind of thing comes with a new microphone

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
That kind of clarity and understanding

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
My brother, my brother and me, what can I do to build my confidence

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So I can go out there and meet some new ladies around my age

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Or is focusing on school and work now, meeting someone if I'm lucky and okay strategy for the next couple of years

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It's like I'm desperate for some action

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
I just wonder if I'm making a mistake by not going out there and making myself available

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Kevin

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, I hope that ladder strategy is a good one

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I sure hope so

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Do you think it's going to be like a pizza delivery girl?

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
I have these 24 buffalo wings that you ordered with extra blue cheese

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Hey, you are cute

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Nice tip, do you want to go on a date?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Blue cheese is my favorite too

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Listen, Kevin, cut your fingernails, take the boards off the windows

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Get out there, meet some people

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Stop living, I am legend

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Get out there

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
It's a sad fact of reality, Kevin

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
But here's the thing, okay

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Maybe you are going to meet your special lady

05:35.000 --> 05:44.000
Maybe you are going to be the kind of guy who just walks into a gas station one day and there she is

05:44.000 --> 05:54.000
But statistically speaking, that somebody special is going to be a special somebody if you expose yourself to more members of the opposite sex

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
That's just science

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Metaphorically

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Don't really expose yourself, we don't want to be a party to that

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
You don't know you might meet a special someone in federal prison

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
Kevin, you got to get out there, you got to say hi

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
As far as building confidence goes, you got to not be afraid to fail

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
Unfortunately, it's not going to be a confidence builder right away, especially if you are not good at it

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Just don't fail in front of anybody

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Because that will be so embarrassing

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Why don't you take her into a dark abandoned alley where no one can see and fail

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
That's a good opening line too

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
I'd like to take you, I'm about to hit on you, but I'd like to take you to a dark abandoned alley to do it in

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Because I don't want anybody to see

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
That should be a pretty good ice breaker

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
It's no mane of hair as an ice breaker, but it is a pretty good one

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I'll tell you this, you'll get a reaction every time and that's what you're looking for

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Something will happen

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
You're just looking for a reaction

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
You can get strong by being constantly rejected, that's how some people would do it

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Just build up that thick hide

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Really, just scars across your heart

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
You could just walk up to girls randomly and say, no thanks

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
And then walk away

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
Say you're mass rejecting lots of girls without ever risking being rejected

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Take it a step further, walk into a bar and announce at the top of your lungs

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I don't want to sleep with any of you

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Walk through it and then walk out

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Sorry ladies, off limits

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
They will flock to you as you leave the bar

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Get a t-shirt that says, sorry ladies, off limits

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I bet that t-shirt would work for you

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I bet that would work

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Young man, just use your test submission

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
You two work it out

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Travis, go

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I was just going to say, there was a comedian once who said the best way to get a woman to sleep with you

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Is to walk in and tell her that you are bad at sex

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
So I was just going to say, approach women and say

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I am awkward and uncomfortable and don't know how to talk to women

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And just lead with that

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
That's my advice, go Griffin, go

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Yahoo Answers user Tessa Mission asks

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
Oh this was sent in by a Twitter user Mr. D Muffin

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
So thank you Mr. D Muffin

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Tessa Mission asks, when I move out I want to adopt a whole family from Ethiopia

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
I have a heart for starving children and I'm about to move out

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I'm getting a 149 acre home and I plan to have a farm

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
But I would like to help a family out and adopt a whole family

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And build them their own little house on my land

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And share a little bit of land for them

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
I was wondering if they would let me take them out of their country without a passport or

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah, that's how it works

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
You need to make sure you poke holes in the box

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure what you just described was light slavery

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Mild slavery

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Just maybe a little, a touch of slavery

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
That's like, you just described like the PG-13 edited for TV version of Roots

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
No, I just want to adopt this family from another nation

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Are you with me so far?

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
They can live on my, I wouldn't call it a plantation, but it is plantation sized

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
A fun-tation

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
A fun-tation, sure

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I don't grow any crops yet

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
But I'm thinking about getting in the crop game

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
You know it would be handy if they wanted to help out

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
What kind of crops?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Room and board

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, textiles

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Textiles?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Mostly

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So they're going to be picking felt

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Felt, hemp, stuff along those lines

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I'm going to build them a house though

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Not a big house

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
More like a room

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
But not a small house, right?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Not tiny

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
And I imagine when I adopt them, at first they'll be really scared

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Because they're not going to know what's going on

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
They may resist even

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
But you know, I think eventually they'll appreciate the fulfillment

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
A fulfilling day of work can provide

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
So yeah, so lady, you don't have a heart for starving children

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
You are a slave master

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
You're a slave master

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
That is illegal, what you just described

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
It's the warm feeling she gets from the terrified looks on their faces

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
That's all the payment she needs

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Is it okay

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And their free labor

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Is it okay to pee in the bathroom sink if you're drunk?

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I ran the faucet for a while, if that helped

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Read the last

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Peace

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Read it all together

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Making sure that you add that last word

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Because it really makes it

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Is it okay to pee in the bathroom sink if you're drunk?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I ran the faucet for a while, if that helped

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Peace

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Nick

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I am

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Before I answer your question

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I am put off by the change of tense

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
In the middle of your question

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Because you went from like

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Right after the question mark

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And then are retroactively asking our forgiveness

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That's the context to me

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
That's the hidden meaning between the lines

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Or the question marks in this case

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
He didn't pee in my bathroom sink though

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
So he has nothing to

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
He has nothing to ask forgiveness for

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
That's a good question, are you peeing in your own bathroom sink?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Or like the bathroom sink at a bar

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Because that's not okay

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm sure if we did a silent canvas

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Of the three people on this podcast

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
We could probably find

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
One person who has peed

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
In the bathroom sink

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
On a regular basis

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Not anymore, but used to

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
You're thinking just one?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Oh Jesus

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Statistically speaking, at least one person on this podcast

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
At least one

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Definitely less than three

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
We

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Okay, I think that

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I have to ask this question

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
What is the compulsion for peeing in the sink?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
It's just there and you're just like

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Especially when you've been drinking

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't know if you're like

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Throwing off society's rules

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Or just saying you're your own man

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And you pee where you want

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I mean, it's a pretty sucky revolution

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Because it's still like going on the same spot

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
So you're not exactly

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
You know

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
They're not making post avoid signs about it

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Yeah, I mean it's kind of

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
It has to be an act of rebellion

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
You think it is, not a good one

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Not like a super rebellious one

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Just clean it up afterwards

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
He ran the faucet if it helps

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I think what we've agreed on is it's not okay

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
To pee in the sink if you're drunk

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
But if you're sober, it's totally cool

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, I just want it to be a choice

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Hey guys, I'm in love with my best friend of two years

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
And I'm not sure if she likes me back

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Any advice?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
You should move away

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Move away, change your name

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Or I got an alternate

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
How about this?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Ask her

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Pussy

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Just

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Why would you ask her pussy?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
We need to get the punctuation straight in that sentence

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Ask her pussy or

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Ask her pussy

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Now, get a defining rod

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
No

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
And I say that

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I call you

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
That name, which I shouldn't be using

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Female genitalia as a slang term

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I'm gonna say wimpo

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
What about wiener?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Ask her wiener

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Stop being a wiener and ask her wiener

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I say that with love

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
She's your best friend two years

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
That's at one thirty fifth of your life

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Statistically speaking

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
How about you just ask her and either get to Frenchin

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Or beat cheeks out of there

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
And keep this in mind, when you ask her

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And if she says no

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
You do have to move away

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
So there's your answer

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Now do me a favor and stop listening so I can give everyone else an answer

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
She doesn't like him

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
No, that's not true

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
No, that's not true

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
If after two years he doesn't know

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
If she likes him back

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Dude's shy

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Listen, form spring dude, just ask her

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Trust me

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Cause that's gonna be the best day ever

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
If it works

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
If we were her mom

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Ask her mom if she likes him

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yahoo Answers user

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Gally McClarr

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Nah

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
You just wanna go ahead and

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
That's not a name

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
No, the name is David

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
David asks

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Does a woman ever love a stalker?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
A stalker

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Who stalks 24-7

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
From childhood to adulthood

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
For five long years

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Wait, what?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah, there are layers

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Whoa, there are many things happening here

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I am uncomfortable with

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Wait, is there more to the question?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
There are additional details that say

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I mean from teen to adult age

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
So I would say

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Maybe

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And also my delete key is broken so I can't edit

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
That thing I said just a second ago

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
16 to 21, I'll say

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Okay

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
But here's the thing

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm gonna put it in this shit and kick it down another level

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Incept it

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I'm gonna incept it

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Is this the stalker asking the question?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Or is it the stalkie?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh my god

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
You just blew my mind

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
My mind is blown, you think that maybe she's like

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Listen

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I don't wanna give everybody the wrong idea about stalking

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
But sometimes

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It works

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Like maybe

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah, maybe she actually kinda likes this dude

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
That she sees occasionally going through her trash

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
But she doesn't know if it's okay to like him

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
She hated

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
And hated it and was scared of it

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
And couldn't stand it and then

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
After years of it

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
It's not that she loves it

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
She's used to it, it's like the new Arcade Fire album

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You just

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Wait and wait and wait and eventually

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You get him

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And finally you get this stalker

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
You understand where he's coming from

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
You just gave me an idea

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
If I ever stalk someone

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I'm gonna put on a giant raccoon suit

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Before I start going through their trash

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
That buys me like 20 minutes

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Honey, honey

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Honey, don't move

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Don't move, but look out the window

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
They can smell fear

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
That ring-tailed bastard

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Hey, I've wanted braces for a couple of years now

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
And have finally gone to the orthodontist

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I was expecting to pay around

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
1800 to 2000

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Squiggle marks

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I believe that's pounds

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Is it pound or is it lira?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Which even at that amount would be very

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Really difficult for me to pay, but once I got to the orthodontist

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
He told me it would cost 3200

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Lira, euro, pounds

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
To have braces

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
This amount would mean a huge commitment

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Over two years of my life. I'm only 18

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And want to go to university next year

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
My teeth are not extremely crooked, but they definitely need braces

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Should I plunge into debt for a couple of years

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
With the reward of straight teeth

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Or wait it out until I'm 24 to 25

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Or maybe never

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I don't know who to ask, please help

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Thanks, David

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I do want to point out

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
He didn't type

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Not extremely crooked, but they definitely

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Need braces

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
He says not extremely crooked, but they defiantly

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Need braces, which I like

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
You're like, hey, hey, listen

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I'm your teeth, deal with it

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Give me some braces, you bastard

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Give me braces

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
David, again, I can't

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Say this enough, I know I brought it up

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
In a few episodes, but I was the only

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Macaroy fortunate enough

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
To know the sweet embrace

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Of braces

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
There's no amount

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Too high for that feeling

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
You know how

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
You know how in your life

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
You have these random things where

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Everyone's staring at my eyebrow

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Everyone's looking at my

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
This zit on my cheek

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Everyone looks at your teeth

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It is actually true

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Look to your grill, get that grill fixed

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Because when you talk, everyone's

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Looking at your mouth

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It's true

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
You could just tell people

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
To deal with it

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Hey, save some money

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Get a tattoo on your lip that says deal with it

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
That would be way cheaper

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
That's something people are going to remember

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Whatever happened to David

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Who used to come around, I don't remember David

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
But I do remember a guy who had a tattoo

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
On his lip that said deal with it

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
And I respected him for it

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Can the top lip say yeah, I know

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
And the bottom lip say deal with it

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, and on the inside

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You pull down your lower lip and there's a

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Chinese character for strength

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Have you thought about getting like

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
A grill, like getting

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Gold teeth, diamonds

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Oh my god, yes, that's gotta be cheaper

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
But if you've got a fucked up grill

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And you get a real grill on top of it

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You're gonna look like a Bond villain

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Yes

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Why are you listing things that are positives

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
And pretending they're negatives

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Why is that not awesome

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm saying either

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Get that sweet embrace

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Because it feels so good, I gotta tell you

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Having your teeth move around

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It's an experience

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Do you think they would sell better if they were called

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Embraces

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Embraces? I don't think so

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I would buy them, I don't even need them

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Or just be confident

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Because people find confidence in faults

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Sexy, that's why Kirsten Dunst is

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
As famous as she is nowadays

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
She's got a grill that looks like

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
She stopped a train with her teeth

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I wouldn't go that far

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
But I do know what you're saying

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Confidence, if you don't pretend

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
It's a thing, other people won't even notice

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
You know what gives someone confidence?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Having $3200 in their pocket

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Well

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Not dollars though, I don't know

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
It might be really cheap

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't know what this money means

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Is it rubles, do people still use those

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Rubles? I think it's shekels

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Shekels?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Brothers 3, help me out

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
At the moment

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I'm in algebra class I failed last year

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
And I got stuck with the same

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Old bag lecturer

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I need to pass this class to get my

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Engineering degree, Josh from Gmail

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Josh didn't explicitly state

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
A problem in this question

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Yeah, it sounds like

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Josh, you're on the right track

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm not good at

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Algebra, like if you

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
You've come to the exact wrong place

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
If that's what you're looking for

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Geometry may be something

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
You gotta cheat, which is how I got through

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Both of my high school algebra classes

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Go on

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You sit near a smart kid who wants

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Friends

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Hey Josh, I'm gonna hit you with something

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Kinda pull the camera back a little bit

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Let's zoom out for a second

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Maybe you

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Are in the wrong field

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Maybe

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
You aren't

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Cut out for this, maybe this isn't

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Your right calling if you're having such trouble

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah, math is

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Kind of important in engineering, isn't it?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah, it seems like you need to know this shit

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
If it's this tough for you

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
They build bridges and shit, right?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Yeah, I kinda want you on point

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I kinda want you to be like

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Really bomb at this class

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I would like you to leave the class

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Stand up and walk out

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
And be like, no bridges for me, thanks

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
You know what has never

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I've never been walking across a bridge

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And had someone say, you know who built this bridge?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
The guy who can't do algebra

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And just felt awash with confidence

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, I remember when I

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Built this bridge, that was the third time I felt

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Algebra, and hey, it's not my fault

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I was in the same lecture, but I did drop out of school

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I don't know why they didn't let me make a bridge

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I am good at Legos

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
That's only cause it's up

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
You gotta let a boat through

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Josh

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Just stand up and

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Announce to the class that algebra

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Is useless, and see how the teacher

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Reacts, she may

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
He or she, I guess old bag

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
That sounds like a she, she may

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Wink out of existence when faced with

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
That sort of incontrovertible

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Logic

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I did that to a social studies teacher one time

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Did you? Did it work?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I said, this is so pointless, I will never use this

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Information, and then they just

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Cease to exist

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Stand up and yell

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
You madam have killed the frail

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Old lady that is algebra

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
And

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
See if you can start leading a revolt

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah, oh

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
So you want him to kill her, lord of the

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Fly style

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
You know what, I ain't against it, blow that conch shell

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Blow that conch shell, get Peggy to

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Smother, dear

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Mubim Bam, I'm having a bit of difficulty

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
With the bros before hoes rule

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, that's not a good start

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
But keep going, the majority of my friends happen to

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Be female, and I only have a few male friends

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Would my female friends be considered

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Bros and my male friends hoes?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Thanks for your help

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
No

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
You're doing it wrong

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
You're doing it wrong, bros before

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Hoes is

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Kind of a dumb thing to say

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I want to deconstruct it and take you back

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
You

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
There is, bros before hoes

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Is something that men

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Say to each other to make themselves

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Feel better, because

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I want to take you

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Real deep in here, it's always hoes

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Before bros

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
It's always women, always girls

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Let's peel back another layer

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
They're not thinking about you

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Peel back another layer though, because the bigger problem

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Here is that you are

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Unironically using the word bro

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
And hoe

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I don't know which one's worse

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Both pretty bad

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
They're both really bad

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Uh, I

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
How about

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Sounds like you're in a chicks before dicks

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Kind of situation

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
In any event

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Your male friends would never

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Be your hoes, that is

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
It is important to know

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Here's a good test

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Gather all your

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Male friends together at Giovanni's

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Walk into Giovanni's and say what's up my hoes

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Sup hoes

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
See how that goes over

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
The thing is, the phrase bros before

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Hoes is something that the other

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Guys use

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
To keep you

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
From like, ditching them

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
It's not like, it's nothing

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Any guy has ever sat down and go, you know

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I'd love to go home with this lady

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
But bros before hoes, I suppose

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
It does

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Bros before hoes, I suppose, should be the new one

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Bros before hoes

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Only apply, Travis is right

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
It's never a life choice, like

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Guy post, you never say like

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I should go to my best friend

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Tommy's bar mitzvah

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
But I have a date with

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
This girl who is very attractive

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Well bros before hoes, it's not

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Like that, it's something where he calls you

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
And says hey, I'm gonna

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Invoke bros before hoes I suppose

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Are you?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
You got me good

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
I've been trying to think of a bros before

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Hoes except after

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Joe's, it's escaping me

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Except after

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Moe's, cause if you've had Moe's burritos

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
You can just go home

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Bros before hoes except after Moe's

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Also

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
It does work

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
For your literal bros

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Yeah, always

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Push comes to shove

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Your real

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Biological bros

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
And we are

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
We are your biological brothers

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
I've been doing that wrong

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
For years

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Biobros before hoes

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
What you want to say

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Biodome before hoes

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Late to the fad on twitter asks if

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I think that's kinda fresh

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm not crazy about it

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Only the dudes

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
I kinda like Mambas

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
And call them the great BIMBAMBINO

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000

And then our fattest fan

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Can be the great HAMBINO

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Fan, let us know

I think that show is called The Biggest Loser

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And it already exists

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
So if you are

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
MBMBAM's fattest fan

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
You send in an email or a tweet

With your current

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Total weight

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
No pictures of your girth

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Because I ain't trying to get sick over here

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Just the facts and figures

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Just the stats, and then let us know

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000

Just the stats comma fats

No that's not required

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Yahoo

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Answers user

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I look so good without you

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Asks

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Is there, oh jesus

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Is there was a disease and it killed everyone

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
On this planet except you

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
And some other person who was ugly

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
It didn't kill

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
You two because you were both immune to it

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Kind of like in the movie I Am Legend

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Except opposite

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Would you kill yourself or would you

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Continue living and have a sexual relationship

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
With that one ugly person

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Oh my god is this person asking

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Would you rather kill yourself than

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Fucking ugly person

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
That is exactly what they're asking

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Would you rather bring humanity

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
To a screeching halt

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Yeah

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Speaking of

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Confidence that's gotta be like the worst hit

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Like two people left you look

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
At them and just say well that ends this

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Chapter of humanity I suppose

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Dead

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Make sure you say something to him before

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Cause I want him to live with that

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
That's how humanity should go out

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
With a sad person too ugly to have sex with

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Not with a bang

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
But with a suicide

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Or a double

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Hey

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Why don't you just kill that other person

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I mean doesn't that solve

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Your problem

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
If you

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Don't want to have sex with this ugly person

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Because you're the last person on earth

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Who won't have sex with him don't kill yourself

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Why does that even make sense

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Why do you have to kill yourself

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Or just junk on him

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Whatever

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Did the disease also destroy all the bags

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
In the world

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Come on

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Take care of this

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Okay don't kill yourself

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Please for all of us just start

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Although you know what I was gonna say

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
They should not bring humanity to a halt

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Think about it half a go kids

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Nobody wants that

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
The whole human race is like

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
That gene will never come out of the pool

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
The ugly gene will never

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
To come up with a question to ask you

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Alright

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I'm so glad you asked

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
This is a little bit before we get into this

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
This is a little bit like

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Could god make a rock so big that even he couldn't lift a thing

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Right like this is pretty spacey

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Should we come up with a question

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
That we couldn't answer

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
We may wink this out of existence

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
But we do need to address

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Some things

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
That have been happening in our lives

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
In the life of the show

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
We're so happy that people have been sending in questions

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I was

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Like from episode 1

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
We started getting more than enough questions

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
That we needed to put an episode together

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And that's awesome

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
That's really great

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
But they've started to take

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
A turn

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
What kind of turn

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
A turn

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Towards

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
The creepy

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And I'm not saying all of them

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
If your question is not on the show

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
It's not because it was creepy

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I don't know

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
How to address this

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Because I don't want to sound ungrateful

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Stop asking us about poop

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
That's a good first step

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
If that is even in there

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Even as a concept

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Just edit it out

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Not good

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Not a good question

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Because we probably won't read that on the show

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I can't even say that

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Because my mic traffic

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Is rerouted through China

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
They censor anything scatological

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
That I talk about

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
So that's pretty whack

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Speaking of whack

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Maybe don't ask creepy questions

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
About like

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Jango

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Or joing

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Or jingo

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
That probably won't get read either

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Or Kimbo slice

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And none of that

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Don't ask any of those things

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Just ask

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Just ask a straight up question

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
True from your own life

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Not made up

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Because we know if you're making things up

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
It's pretty obvious

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
You send in made up things and they're funny

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
And we appreciate the humor

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
And it's so awesome that you want to share that

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Funny story with us

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
But we're not going to read it on the show

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Probably

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
But I would like to see

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
If you can't come up with a question

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Or if you've had a question before

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
And you followed our advice

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I would like to know how that worked out for you

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
We can maybe read some of those

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I would remind you

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Never follow our advice

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
But if you do

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
We are not liable

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
The best thing we can tell you

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Is to ask for advice

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
About something

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Don't ask a question

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Like what's your favorite

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Type of hot dog

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
But ask for advice

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Because it's an advice show

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Or do what that one guy did

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
And send us pictures of his girlfriend

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
That works too

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Or tell us how fat you are

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
So either ask for advice

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Tell us how fat you are

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Or send us emails about how much you like Griffin

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Just the stats

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Please

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I have a two year old son who is awesome

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
And lately everybody thinks that

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Catherine

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I have a two year old kid who is dumb

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Boring

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Do something fun, stupid

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I have another one

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Ever since I was a little girl

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I only wanted one child and I'm not sure if I

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Really want another child or I miss having a baby

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Because my son is getting older

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
What to do?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
That's true

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I think it would be pretty lonely

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Growing up an only child

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I think you probably have three kids

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I think that's about the right number

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
And three boys

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Three beautiful bouncing baby boys

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Two year old is pretty good

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Let's have another one though

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Catherine

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I want you

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
One

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
You're asking the wrong

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
You're doing it wrong

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
You shouldn't ask us if you should have a child

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
But if you do

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
And I'm going to wholeheartedly insist that you do now

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
You have to name it something

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Show related because it's very

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Existence is thanks

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
To my brother, my brother

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
We basically are going to have a son

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
The three of us are going to have a son

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Pretty soon

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
We're going to be your child's godparents

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
We're it's pod father

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Holy shit

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
That's got to be trademarked somewhere

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Just DM it

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Copyright

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
What I want you to do

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Is when you get ready

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
For the baby making times

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
However that works

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Play this episode

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Put a song in the background

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Because we want our son to have a

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Strong confident voice in his life

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
That he can

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
He knows that he can turn to whenever he needs anything

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Except for money

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Yeah

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And make sure you play our show on headphones

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
On your belly like I see on TV sometimes

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
With Mozart and stuff

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Baby Einstein tapes

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
We should make baby Einstein tapes

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
That'd be great

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
But it's cool instead of smart

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Justin Travis Griffin the third

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I love it what about Batman

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
See I was thinking Preston

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Preston

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Hi I'm Preston Bim Bam Stevenson

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It's a pleasure

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
And I want to be the next president of the United States

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
That's what I hear in my head when I hear that

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I appreciate your support

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I appreciate your support

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Third term

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Who are these three guys hanging from my coattails

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Those are my pod fathers

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I'm going to

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Find them lush cabinet positions

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
In a lush cabinet

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Oh this is nice this velvet

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I want to hear Griffin's last question

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
But a couple things

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
First if you want to ask

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
A question of the show

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
All the methods you can do that on are

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
At mbnbam.com

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
We love it when

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
People tweet about quotes or how fat they are

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Just make sure

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
You use that mbnbam hashtag

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
If you

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Want to buy something there's a

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Buy stuff link there where you can

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Buy our My Brother My Brother Me

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
App experience it's two dollars

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
You can listen to all the shows and ask us

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Questions and there's some special

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Features and

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
You can also

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
You can still

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Get T-shirts

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
The pre-orders are over

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
But we have some extra supply

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
So those are available on the site

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
And those are going to start shipping out

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Hopefully this week

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
And they're going to be shipped in the order

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
That they were ordered

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
So if you got on it early

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Then they should be there thank you

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
You guys were so super supportive

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
With the T-shirts and

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
The app and everything and we really

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Seriously cannot tell you enough

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
How much we appreciate it you guys have been

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Super super cool

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
About it and make sure when you

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Get your T-shirt I want to

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
See pictures of everybody

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Wearing T-shirts and like

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Maybe we can make a page on the site

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Where people can just

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And not just wearing the T-shirt I would like to see it

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
In provocative places like

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Places where perhaps

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
A Hey Jeffrey T-shirt isn't appropriate

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Yeah like a funeral

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Yeah especially a funeral

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Nothing turns a funeral into a funeral

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Like a Hey Jeffrey T-shirt

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And nothing

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Turns a funeral into a funnel

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Like a funnel

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And uh

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
If you know someone who's good at making websites

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I think we could use a new one

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
So let us know

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I'm looking at our website right now

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
It looks like an ad for the New York Times

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
But so all that

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
We should just adopt an Ethiopian family to make us a website

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Make that website

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
As quick as you want but do make it

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
As quick as you want but do make it

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
And make sure you subscribe to the show

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
And rate the show

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Tell a friend

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
We have over 400 ratings now which is just

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
It's mind boggling

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
You guys boggle my mind on a regular basis

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
My mind is boggled

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
My mind is boggled

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Boggleded

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Boggling as what?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Zach Stelz on Twitter

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
He introduced his boss to the show

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
So

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I'm sorry about getting you fired

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
But we do appreciate you spreading the word

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Thank you

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Hit me

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I've been excited to read this question

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I've been excited the whole time

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
This question comes to us from

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I think it's Sechal

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
S-E-A-C-H-E-L

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Not a real name

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
But here we go

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
