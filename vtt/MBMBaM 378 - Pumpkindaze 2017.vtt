WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:52.720
Oh man, I can feel it.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.360
You know, until you hit the second part of that verse, it's very confusing.

01:05.360 --> 01:05.840
Yeah.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.240
Every human heart will shudder.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.720
Still could be Tim Curry talking about fucking.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.560
Every soul will shake with fear.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.000
Less about fucking, but...

01:16.000 --> 01:24.560
Tonight, the creepiest. Tonight, the scariest.

01:24.560 --> 01:33.040
Tonight, the most wonderful night.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.720
Oh yeah, buttery.

01:34.720 --> 01:40.320
Oh, oh.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.920
Oh, ah yeah.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.200
I have goose flesh, and I'm also rock hard all over.

01:51.200 --> 01:51.600
Yeah.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.200
Anything can happen on Halloween.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.600
Your dog could turn into a cat.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.840
There's a surprising, you're doing a surprising amount.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.240
Maybe a toad in your bass guitar.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.880
Oh, your sister could turn into a bat.

02:04.880 --> 02:05.760
That's the end of fair use.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.360
Christmas time brings the snow.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.320
Summertime brings the sun.

02:13.360 --> 02:18.480
But on Halloween, your blood begins to run.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.680
There's something spooky going down now.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.320
Anything can happen on Halloween.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.280
We owe them a tremendous amount of money now.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.440
It's better than a video.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.640
Is this fair use?

02:28.640 --> 02:29.360
No, not at all.

02:29.360 --> 02:34.720
Gremlin's gonna mess up every cassette from London to Idaho.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.320
April 1st can be fun.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.080
New Year's Eve is a bore.

02:42.080 --> 02:47.760
But on Halloween, your flesh begins to crawl.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.160
Oh, I'm losing control now.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.440
Anything can happen on Halloween.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.960
Your toenails go wrong and your hair turns green.

02:56.960 --> 02:57.520
What?

02:57.520 --> 03:00.800
Your teacher could become a sardine.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.280
What?

03:01.280 --> 03:04.160
Your dentist could turn into a queen.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.000
Anybody seen my tambourine?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.360
I might start playing.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.560
I've been fighting a fucking tambour.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.880
I'm gonna play and begin the begin.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.240
The craziest night you've ever seen.

03:16.240 --> 03:32.960
This hairy, scary, creepy, crawly Halloween.

03:32.960 --> 03:39.440
So that was from the worst switch, the 1986 version, not the new one.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.440
And that was produced by HBO.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.760
So this might be the last episode of My Brother, My Brother.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.520
I mean, I think they probably fight for the protection of their properties.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.480
I'm pretty sure that's fair use.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.000
I don't think singing the entire song,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.160
somebody could just cut that and put it up on Spotify

03:54.160 --> 03:57.040
and then we'd get all of Tim Curry's money on that one.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.720
So do you want to introduce the show

04:02.720 --> 04:04.640
or do you think that pretty much summed it up?

04:04.640 --> 04:09.360
I'm Justin McElroy, the best witch.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.160
I'm Travis McElroy.

04:16.160 --> 04:16.640
I'm okay.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.360
I do okay as far as witching goes.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.360
I'm neither top nor bottom.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.640
I would say I am a mediocre witch.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.320
I'm a sandwich.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.320
Sandwich.

04:28.320 --> 04:28.880
I get it.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.440
Very good, Griffin.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.320
Jesus, Juice.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.160
That was, I didn't think you would really do the whole, the whole track.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.640
Once I get started, I can't stop.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.600
It's so good.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.240
And now your voice is sort of extra gravelly.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.600
It's been touched by Tim.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.160
Justin's going to be in that deep register,

04:46.160 --> 04:47.680
touched by Tim the whole recording.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.400
I need a little bit of this Taco Bell diet Pepsi.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.080
Live moss.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.560
So this is an advice show for the Modron era.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.240
I don't know why I'm the one that has to say this stuff

04:58.240 --> 05:00.560
where we take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.760
Free breath.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.480
Yeah.

05:02.480 --> 05:07.600
Well, this is our extra special spooky Halloween crawly episode.

05:07.600 --> 05:13.760
Our All Hallows' Eve, our Samhain, our Dia de los Muertos episode.

05:14.320 --> 05:14.640
Sure.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.920
Our other, there's gotta be more trick or treat.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.960
That's not a real-

05:20.960 --> 05:24.320
Robber's Day is celebrated in some places.

05:24.320 --> 05:24.960
So-

05:24.960 --> 05:26.320
All Saints Day.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.600
All Saints Day.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.560
And it's not Candle Nights yet, though.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.760
It's coming around the corner, though.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.040
I feel-

05:33.040 --> 05:34.800
Unless it is Candle Nights for you.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.600
It might be.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.480
Well, that's true.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.000
Right now, it's just Pumpkin Days.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.600
Pumpkin Days and Scarecrow Nights.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.240
You know what I mean?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.920
D-A-Z-E.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.960
That is me.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.160
I am in a Pumpkin Days.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.360
In a Pumpkin Days,

05:45.360 --> 05:47.440
because everything's got that pumpkin spice in it.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.000
Am I right?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.520
The other day, I had pumpkin spice flavored gas in my car.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.360
So what it sounds like, and let's be careful here

05:55.360 --> 05:57.200
because Travis might be on the verge of establishing

05:57.200 --> 05:58.720
some permanent bim bam lore,

05:58.720 --> 06:02.320
but sounds like you want to add to the agenda Pumpkin Days.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.200
D-A-Z-E.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.000
All one word.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.240
And this is a precursor to Candle Nights

06:07.040 --> 06:09.920
that can last in any amount of time when it's over.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.440
This has a finite beginning.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.400
The beginning of Pumpkin Days is when Starbucks brings back

06:14.400 --> 06:15.920
the pumpkin spice latte.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.520
I don't like giving them that amount of control.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.280
That feels awful commercial to me.

06:19.280 --> 06:19.760
I know.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.840
But listen, we're at a point now we've sold out.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.400
I want to talk about something other than pumpkins.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.840
Well, pumpkins.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.120
Not pumpkin flavor.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.240
I think pumpkin flavor we've covered pretty well.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.760
As a people, we've all talked about

06:33.760 --> 06:35.440
how we feel about pumpkin flavor.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.400
And it's very fun.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
The reason we keep talking about it is it's very funny

06:38.400 --> 06:43.040
to make a joke about this hot, sweet beverage.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.040
I want to talk about pumpkins.

06:46.080 --> 06:46.800
Okay.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.120
Yeah.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.360
Okay, so I drove around-

06:49.360 --> 06:50.240
What even are they?

06:50.240 --> 06:51.200
Big potatoes?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.240
No one's quite sure.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.240
I drove around my neighborhood,

06:54.240 --> 06:56.640
and while some people have Halloween decorations,

06:56.640 --> 06:58.480
which is terrifically spooky,

06:58.480 --> 07:01.280
there's a lot of people who have just put a pumpkin

07:01.280 --> 07:02.160
on their porch.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.280
And I think that that's great and festive.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.360
But I do have to think about this.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.480
It's every pumpkin's first Halloween.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.320
That must be so confusing.

07:14.320 --> 07:18.640
So you sit sort of at a patch with all your buds,

07:19.200 --> 07:20.880
and then someone brings you home

07:20.880 --> 07:23.440
and just puts you on their porch.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.920
And they're like, well, that'll do.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.880
And then they walk away.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.320
As a pumpkin, what are you expected to do?

07:30.320 --> 07:31.760
It must be very confusing.

07:31.760 --> 07:36.480
What is your role if you're a pumpkin in that scenario?

07:37.200 --> 07:40.640
This is feeling a lot like a new Pixar DreamWorks film,

07:40.640 --> 07:42.560
but maybe an extremely bad one.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.560
So maybe it's actually just a weird,

07:44.560 --> 07:46.400
secular episode of Veggie Tales.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.280
So Justin, if I can make sure I get this straight,

07:51.280 --> 07:55.600
you're worried about the pumpkin's experience in all this.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.000
How is the pumpkin experiencing Halloween?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.240
I don't want to personify it too much

08:00.240 --> 08:03.520
because obviously things get a little rougher

08:03.520 --> 08:05.520
for the pumpkin before they get better.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.920
And by which they never get better

08:07.920 --> 08:10.080
because they don't get put back in the patch.

08:10.720 --> 08:15.920
I think if you do get the Jack O'Lantern treatment,

08:15.920 --> 08:19.040
at least you know where you stand with your owners.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.600
At least you know it's a contentious relationship

08:21.600 --> 08:23.280
and nothing is expected of you.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.920
Yeah, Justin's saying this relationship is,

08:25.920 --> 08:29.440
you were in a field and now you sit in front of my house

08:29.440 --> 08:30.880
and you're just gonna chill there

08:30.880 --> 08:33.440
until neighborhood tubs come and smash you.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.880
Right, if it's a Jack O'Lantern,

08:34.880 --> 08:37.120
the pumpkin's like, oh, I get it, I'm being murdered.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.640
Yeah, and what do you think the pumpkin-

08:38.640 --> 08:40.720
I'm performance art, I get it.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.640
And what do you think the pumpkin thinks

08:42.640 --> 08:44.560
when they cook them into a pie

08:44.560 --> 08:47.920
and sees other food getting cooked

08:47.920 --> 08:50.080
and the food's like, oh no, I'm getting cooked.

08:50.080 --> 08:54.640
Like the funny cartoon sort of sex romp

08:54.640 --> 08:56.560
that the super bad guy made.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.000
I just think it's confusing.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.760
I think that pumpkins are confused.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.960
I mean, like the trees, at least they're a tree.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.040
You just have to tree and they put pretty stuff on you.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.640
I get that, I get that.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.120
But I think for a pumpkin it's like-

09:09.120 --> 09:10.160
Do you mean Christmas tree?

09:10.160 --> 09:12.480
You mean Christmas tree makes sense, we get it.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.760
Christmas tree makes sense, I get it.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.600
You're decorating a tree, I get it.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.400
But the pumpkins are just like, you're food,

09:18.400 --> 09:20.800
but I'm gonna keep your eye here, if that's okay.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.640
And what do the rabbits think on Easter

09:22.640 --> 09:23.760
when I bring them into my house

09:23.760 --> 09:26.800
and I put the little Easter hats on them for the holiday

09:26.800 --> 09:28.800
and I put an egg up inside them?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.640
Yeah, and what about the Arbor Day celery?

09:30.640 --> 09:31.520
You know what I mean?

09:31.520 --> 09:33.120
That's gotta be confusing for the celery.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.120
Bunnies don't even lay eggs.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.080
You ever think about that?

09:36.080 --> 09:41.440
That's why I have to put one in, in there.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.000
Wait, hold on.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.520
What the fuck do you think

09:43.520 --> 09:45.520
we're coloring all these eggs for, Trav?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.520
Just to have a bunch of loose eggs all over the place?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.200
No, it's to finish the illusion,

09:49.200 --> 09:52.160
it's to complete the art, complete the egg.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.160
I guess I got egg on my face.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.120
We gotta tell a joke at some point,

09:57.120 --> 09:58.240
we're like 10 minutes in.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.520
So far all we've done is sing a Tim Curry song

10:01.520 --> 10:03.120
and then done a bunch of,

10:03.120 --> 10:04.880
we've just said a lot of sentences,

10:04.880 --> 10:07.360
but they haven't had a sort of traditional joke construction.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.680
I feel like if more people around the podcast

10:11.680 --> 10:15.280
had leaned in with my great pumpkin material,

10:15.280 --> 10:16.400
that it would have caught fire.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.440
I would just sort of scattering tinder on the ground,

10:19.440 --> 10:20.800
hoping that someone would come along

10:20.800 --> 10:23.840
and light it into a comforting comedy blaze.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.200
So should we do a question?

10:26.080 --> 10:28.640
Yeah, it seems, I mean, that might work.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.840
Oh, I do wanna say,

10:29.840 --> 10:32.560
so I was putting questions together for this episode.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.440
We did not announce like we're gonna do a Halloween special,

10:36.080 --> 10:39.520
but y'all just sent in some questions

10:39.520 --> 10:41.120
intentionally Halloween spooky,

10:41.120 --> 10:44.160
but some questions that were just naturally spooky

10:44.160 --> 10:46.480
and it makes me wonder if maybe the world is just scary

10:46.480 --> 10:48.640
all the time and it's Halloween to notice.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.920
Yeah, weird, yeah, weird.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.800
You just noticed now, okay.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.160
Here's the first question.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.160
Earlier, I was speaking to my brother

10:56.160 --> 10:58.400
and he stopped in the middle of the conversation,

10:58.400 --> 10:59.680
stared me dead in the eyes

10:59.680 --> 11:03.120
and ripped out the pockets of his jeans.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.640
I've never been more terrified by a human's raw power.

11:08.640 --> 11:12.080
The strength of not only him ripping the fabric out of his pants

11:12.080 --> 11:14.480
as he was still wearing them,

11:15.200 --> 11:17.760
but also these are his favorite pants

11:17.760 --> 11:19.120
and he still wears them.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.160
Should I confront him or immediately go

11:22.160 --> 11:23.680
and search for a priest?

11:23.680 --> 11:25.840
That's from thank you for your time,

11:25.840 --> 11:27.600
but I fear by the time you see this,

11:27.600 --> 11:30.480
he will have come from my own pockets, Gmail.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.800
I don't know, I mean, this is certainly startling.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.400
I don't know if this is Halloween spooky.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.280
I don't think your brother is the pocket man

11:39.280 --> 11:39.520
and there they go.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.560
This does make me think,

11:40.560 --> 11:43.440
you know, it's easy for us when we watch a horror movie

11:43.440 --> 11:46.240
and you see someone acting strangely in the movie

11:46.240 --> 11:48.160
and you, the observer are like,

11:49.120 --> 11:51.760
why doesn't this person realize that something's off

11:51.760 --> 11:53.280
with the clearly something's off?

11:53.280 --> 11:55.120
But then you see this story and it's like,

11:55.120 --> 11:57.200
you know what, maybe they're just like,

11:57.200 --> 11:58.960
well, that's my weird brother

11:58.960 --> 12:00.800
who rips the pockets out of his jeans.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.640
And he's like, no, he was possessed.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.280
He was possessed.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.000
Why didn't you see it?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.320
Like anyone watching the movie of Question Askers Life

12:06.320 --> 12:08.160
was like, get out of the house.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.880
What I think happened here is,

12:10.880 --> 12:14.400
cause really there's no reason to rip pockets

12:14.400 --> 12:16.000
off of your jeans.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.440
I am convinced that the only reason

12:17.440 --> 12:19.920
we are all wearing pants is because of the pockets

12:19.920 --> 12:22.080
so we can have a place to carry our yo-yos in.

12:23.200 --> 12:27.680
But I think maybe the pockets were maybe loose already.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.440
And as a fun stunt or a sort of superiority play,

12:31.440 --> 12:33.600
your brother just weirded out Yankovic

12:33.600 --> 12:35.680
those bad boys right off the pants.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.960
I am more impressed.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.800
I am, okay, let's take a quick poll.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.760
What's more impressive?

12:39.760 --> 12:43.520
The raw power of rending the pockets from the jeans

12:43.520 --> 12:47.040
or the sort of like devil may care,

12:48.240 --> 12:50.160
throw caution to the wind nihilism

12:51.840 --> 12:53.920
of saying I don't need pockets

12:53.920 --> 12:57.760
because I, Justin McElroy, I need pockets desperately.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.320
Oh yes.

12:58.320 --> 13:02.000
Like I think non-pockets would be insta-trash

13:02.000 --> 13:03.520
for my jeans if they didn't have pockets.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.160
Human beings need pockets so badly.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.240
We invented fanny packs.

13:08.240 --> 13:08.640
Yep.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.880
Like we had to get additional pockets

13:10.880 --> 13:12.480
to strap onto our pants.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.040
Nobody looks at a cargo pant and says

13:15.040 --> 13:18.000
that will make people very attracted to me.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.880
They think I have a full-size original Game Boy

13:21.600 --> 13:24.320
and damn it, oops, I have four of them

13:24.320 --> 13:26.880
and now I have a home for all of them and this is great.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.920
If you imagine it from this person's perspective,

13:32.560 --> 13:34.800
it would be pretty terrifying.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.880
Yeah, especially if there's some kind of noise

13:36.880 --> 13:38.000
associated with the tear.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.640
Like there's a, he did it and then he dropped right back to.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.880
So anyways, yeah, Garden's a gallon ticket too.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.680
I really liked it.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.280
It's like, no, what just happened?

13:47.280 --> 13:49.600
We gotta, it's gotta be the rear.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.800
I'm looking at my own pants now

13:50.800 --> 13:52.160
and I would encourage everybody at home

13:52.160 --> 13:54.000
to think of this as your own self.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.600
I can't really tear the front pockets out of my pants

13:57.600 --> 14:00.080
because they are part of it.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.080
It's not like I have a pocket on top of it.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.200
Like I do, the back pockets are just like a flap

14:05.200 --> 14:09.440
that's buttoned up over the butt of my jeans fabric.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.040
That is not true for the front pocket.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.040
So this had to be a rear pocket situation,

14:13.040 --> 14:16.960
which I think only makes this more confusing for me.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.640
Oh, see, I was picturing like the fabric sleeve,

14:20.640 --> 14:22.640
the fabric- The fabric sleeves,

14:22.640 --> 14:24.000
whatever it means, for sure.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.080
The pocket remain, the outside,

14:26.080 --> 14:30.560
but if you're taking like the inner guts of the pocket out,

14:30.560 --> 14:32.560
maybe this person is planning-

14:32.560 --> 14:34.160
He wants to do a secret jerk off.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.360
Well, I wasn't gonna say that, Griffin, but sure.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.160
Your brother's nasty.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.280
Why would he do this before you?

14:39.280 --> 14:40.640
Because now it's gonna be like,

14:40.640 --> 14:42.480
uh-oh, someone's doing a secret jerk off.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.000
We need clues, Mindhunter.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.120
Oh, I know.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.160
I think I know the culprit.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.600
He did it fucking right in front of me,

14:47.600 --> 14:48.480
ripped them right out.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.280
I think it would be, maybe he's like

14:52.080 --> 14:55.280
kind of a Gallagher sort of person or a carrot top.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.960
And he's got a bit where he's like,

14:57.920 --> 14:59.520
I'm trying to find my keys.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.960
And if he did this,

15:00.960 --> 15:05.200
he could just keep reaching deeper and deeper into the pockets.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.280
It would be pretty good if he's like,

15:07.280 --> 15:08.320
no, that's not there.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.520
Nope, nope, that's not there.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.560
No, that's my knee.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.280
Huh, weird.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.480
And then eventually he would probably fall over.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.640
I'm trying to imagine what the punchline is.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.080
He put like really deep pockets.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.920
You're like, okay, you ripped the pocket out.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.880
But then from his knee, he pulls out the keys.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.920
And it's like, holy shit.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.360
He has the world's deepest pocket.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.040
Maybe he's like installing, oh, okay.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.680
Jeans makers, as far as your arm goes down,

15:33.680 --> 15:36.080
that's how long pockets should be from now on.

15:36.080 --> 15:36.880
Man, I love that.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.560
I could get so many runts in there.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.000
I'm gonna do a little experiment.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.640
Like we're on a Bill Nye show

15:42.640 --> 15:44.800
and I'm gonna try to tear the fucking fabric

15:44.800 --> 15:46.240
out of my pants pocket right now.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.040
I'll try mine too.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.320
I'm wearing pajama pants.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.520
I love the pants I'm wearing.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.520
They're some of my favorite brown pants from the Gap,

15:51.520 --> 15:52.480
but I'll still try it.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.760
So Juice, you wanna go same time?

15:54.400 --> 15:55.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.080
All right, Trav, count it down.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.280
Three, two, one, rip.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.880
I'm getting some traction.

16:08.880 --> 16:09.920
Listen, listen.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.200
I'm definitely getting some tear.

16:14.880 --> 16:15.680
Kevin, stop.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.240
Think about it.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.040
It's not worth it.

16:17.040 --> 16:17.540
Shut up.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.280
Oh, I'm doing it.

16:19.280 --> 16:19.760
Okay, I'm done.

16:19.760 --> 16:20.320
I'm done, I'm done.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.560
I'm gonna stop.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.320
You can't start and then not fit.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.480
All right, guys, I really love these pants.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.960
They make my butt look like just two hams.

16:28.960 --> 16:29.840
But you're already...

16:29.840 --> 16:32.000
Okay, this is another great move.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.280
Now take those to a tailor or a dry cleaner

16:35.280 --> 16:36.960
and be like, yeah, pocket mishap.

16:36.960 --> 16:37.840
Oh, bummer.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.000
It wasn't the pocket that was tearing.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.680
It was the seam on the side of my pants.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.960
Okay, let's talk about my current look.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.160
Because now it's not like a cool sort of skinned knee look,

16:48.160 --> 16:50.000
you know, like the acid wash cool look.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.920
It's like maybe six inches from the belt down

16:53.920 --> 16:56.320
on the right seam of my pants.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.920
There's a considerable hole

16:57.920 --> 17:00.640
that one might be able to slot a jawbreaker into.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.040
And I'll never be able to explain to anyone

17:03.040 --> 17:04.000
why they are that way.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.880
Can you text a picture?

17:06.880 --> 17:08.080
Yeah, I'll text you a picture right now.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.680
Oh, no, I don't have my phone.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.560
It's charging in the other room.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.400
But do you not trust me that...

17:12.400 --> 17:12.960
No, I do.

17:12.960 --> 17:13.760
No, I heard it.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.720
I heard it.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.720
Shit, guys, I really like these pants.

17:17.360 --> 17:17.760
Fuck.

17:18.320 --> 17:19.760
All right, well, how about a Yahoo?

17:19.760 --> 17:21.120
Fuck, I'm gonna be sad.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.000
Why did I do that?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.840
I hate peer pressure.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.040
We didn't make you do it.

17:25.040 --> 17:25.920
No peer pressure.

17:25.920 --> 17:26.640
I didn't even suggest it.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.760
Run back the tape.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.720
You brought it up.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.520
I think this is cyber bullying

17:31.520 --> 17:32.560
because we're on a Skype call.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.960
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in

17:34.960 --> 17:36.560
by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.280
Thank you, Seth.

17:37.280 --> 17:37.840
Shit, man.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.080
Thank you, Seth.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.000
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.640
Jim Curry asks,

17:45.920 --> 17:47.280
I have to convenience...

17:48.320 --> 17:49.280
Jesus.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.680
I have to convenience my friends on social media

17:51.680 --> 17:52.800
that I have kidney stone.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.800
It's not for attention.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.320
Actually, I failed my exam

17:56.320 --> 17:57.600
and I have to prepare for it

17:57.600 --> 17:58.800
and I feel ashamed.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.080
So I want to give them an excuse

18:00.080 --> 18:02.320
why I'm not going to spend the weekend with them.

18:02.320 --> 18:02.820
Help.

18:04.880 --> 18:05.380
This isn't...

18:05.920 --> 18:06.560
It's...

18:06.560 --> 18:08.000
I think kidney stones,

18:08.000 --> 18:08.880
personally speaking,

18:08.880 --> 18:10.800
is not a rich comedy vein

18:10.800 --> 18:11.680
because I had one once

18:11.680 --> 18:13.200
that they had to surgically remove it.

18:13.200 --> 18:13.920
I think they put,

18:15.200 --> 18:15.520
you know,

18:16.240 --> 18:16.480
little...

18:16.480 --> 18:19.840
little Dennis Quaid in a machine inside my penis

18:19.840 --> 18:22.000
to go up in there and sort of laser blast it.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.400
And it sucked a lot.

18:24.400 --> 18:24.880
So it's not...

18:24.880 --> 18:27.040
I'm not necessarily thinking it's the funniest,

18:27.040 --> 18:30.240
but I do think that somebody

18:31.040 --> 18:33.680
trying to sell a fake kidney stone

18:33.680 --> 18:38.160
vis-a-vis 140 or perhaps even 280 character tweets

18:38.160 --> 18:39.040
is good to me.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.680
So can you sort of describe

18:41.680 --> 18:43.760
what the experience of having a kidney stone was like?

18:43.760 --> 18:47.280
Can you sort of describe what the experience of having a kidney stone was like, Griffin?

18:47.280 --> 18:47.920
Yeah, sure.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.360
You know how sometimes-

18:49.360 --> 18:50.320
My body's a temple

18:50.320 --> 18:51.840
and I don't allow that sort of thing.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.240
Your body is a fucking bean hole.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.280
It's a hole that you pour beans into

18:58.320 --> 19:00.560
in order for you to just continue to function.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.600
Well, isn't that true of all of us, though?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.600
We're all just bean holes

19:05.600 --> 19:07.280
and if you really think about it.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.120
What it was like...

19:09.120 --> 19:11.760
Okay, you know how sometimes you pee is yellow?

19:11.760 --> 19:12.080
Uh-huh.

19:12.080 --> 19:12.240
Yeah.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.040
Yeah.

19:13.040 --> 19:13.360
Nope.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.080
Not this time around.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.360
You know sometimes you pee

19:17.360 --> 19:22.400
and it doesn't feel like you've just been gored by a big, big bull

19:22.400 --> 19:25.280
or hit by a regular size train?

19:25.280 --> 19:25.600
Uh-huh.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.720
Well, that doesn't have to be the case all the time.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.840
I think maybe we could pull this off with a Vine.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.000
We have to bring Vine back in a six-second video

19:34.000 --> 19:40.400
of you doing a vape trick or water bottle challenge

19:40.400 --> 19:42.160
and you do the water bottle challenge and you get it

19:42.160 --> 19:42.560
and you're like,

19:42.560 --> 19:44.000
haha, hell yeah, oh!

19:44.000 --> 19:44.960
And you fall over.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.480
And then the caption of the Vine is like,

19:48.480 --> 19:51.280
lol in the hospital now, had a kidney stone attack.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.280
But did you see that?

19:53.280 --> 19:54.560
Did you see that flip though?

19:54.560 --> 19:55.520
Hashtag dab.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.000
So what color was the pee?

19:58.720 --> 19:59.920
The bad color, Justin.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.520
Let's not.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.520
People listen to this podcast for pleasure.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.400
I'm just trying to figure out if we could sort of replicate that

20:08.400 --> 20:10.880
with food coloring of some sort

20:10.880 --> 20:12.160
that you could text to your friends,

20:12.160 --> 20:13.600
like guys, I'm freaking out.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.440
You don't go for kidney stone.

20:16.240 --> 20:20.160
You enlist your friends in the diagnosis of it.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.400
So when you do arrive at kidney stone,

20:22.960 --> 20:24.480
it's a win for everybody.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.280
Do you understand?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.160
I do like this.

20:26.880 --> 20:32.160
It's like hashtag lol anybody see Riverdale last night.

20:32.160 --> 20:32.800
So weird.

20:32.800 --> 20:37.360
Also, I have cloudy or foul smelling urine

20:37.360 --> 20:39.520
and persistent need to urinate

20:39.520 --> 20:41.680
and nausea and vomiting lol.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.120
Hashtag jughead.

20:43.120 --> 20:43.680
What a clown.

20:45.840 --> 20:49.520
I'm looking at the Mayo Clinic page for this now.

20:49.520 --> 20:52.800
And it's like, did anybody hear,

20:52.800 --> 20:55.440
anybody got extra tickets to the weekend concert?

20:55.440 --> 20:56.960
Very excited for it.

20:56.960 --> 20:57.840
Also, I'm experiencing-

20:57.840 --> 20:58.720
Who's playing?

20:58.720 --> 21:02.400
Oh, the weekend, but without the second E or the third E.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.560
And also I'm experiencing pain so severe

21:04.560 --> 21:06.880
that I can't sit still or find a comfortable position.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.120
Hashtag hit me back.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.080
I'm available.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.920
Standing tickets are fine.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.520
Does anybody know how cushy the seats are

21:15.520 --> 21:16.400
at the weekend concert?

21:20.400 --> 21:22.320
Maybe you go even further back

21:22.320 --> 21:25.040
and it's not just you talking about the symptoms,

21:25.040 --> 21:27.280
but you set it up for a while in advance

21:27.280 --> 21:32.240
and it's like, haha, anybody get to steak and shake

21:32.240 --> 21:33.520
after the game on Friday?

21:33.520 --> 21:34.800
I'm real excited.

21:34.800 --> 21:40.160
I've been really enjoying my high calcium oxalate diet.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.200
And also I have a family or personal history

21:43.200 --> 21:44.560
of kidney stones, which lol,

21:44.560 --> 21:46.400
I hear is sort of a genetic risk factor.

21:47.280 --> 21:47.760
Lol.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.720
Lol.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.240
Never been a problem for me though.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.200
Lol, I sure have-

21:51.200 --> 21:52.240
Hashtag blessed.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.480
Lol, sure I'm dehydrated, not drinking enough.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.920
I wonder if that's a risk factor

21:55.920 --> 22:00.800
for any sort of condition lol.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.760
Then you loop your friends in like they're like little

22:03.760 --> 22:07.280
little houses and you say like, I don't know,

22:07.280 --> 22:10.320
maybe I've left some clues somewhere in my timeline

22:10.320 --> 22:12.160
where you could help me fix it together.

22:12.160 --> 22:12.880
You could have saved me.

22:12.880 --> 22:13.840
You had all the clues.

22:16.160 --> 22:16.660
Lol.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.020
Lol.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.880
That especially works if he has a friend named Lol.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.640
You could have saved me Lol.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.760
Lol, have I mentioned I've always had gout

22:25.760 --> 22:30.400
and just cannot get enough of all this high sodium,

22:30.400 --> 22:33.840
high oxalate diet, just really getting going for it.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.240
Also I did great on the exam.

22:36.240 --> 22:36.640
Don't even ask.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.560
Also I did very good at the exam.

22:39.120 --> 22:42.560
And I was eating really salty pretzels

22:42.560 --> 22:44.320
while I took the test and they gave me energy

22:44.320 --> 22:47.920
to get 101% and now I'm the teacher.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.280
Kidney stones are intensely, intensely personal.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.720
Maybe you could just have gout.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.640
Yeah, just have gout.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.160
Gout's a way better way to go.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.720
You tell like a 10th grader you've got gout,

22:58.720 --> 23:01.600
they're not going to know what the fuck you're talking about.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.960
Tell them you got the consumption.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.160
I'm a loner.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.320
And you have to move to an arid climate.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.720
I know we were going to play Mario Odyssey all weekend,

23:08.720 --> 23:11.280
but yeah, I've got TB.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.120
I don't know what to say.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.640
Gotta move to the desert.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.000
Y'all I'm thinking about it.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.560
Disquade never did come out.

23:20.960 --> 23:24.400
He's in my wormy somewhere.

23:25.040 --> 23:25.540
Yeah.

23:26.080 --> 23:26.720
Exploring.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.280
Meditating.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.080
Meditating.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.920
He loves, he's very peaceful.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.240
Dennis, please don't, please don't go back.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.400
Please don't go back inside of there, bud.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.760
Oh, shoot, bud.

23:35.760 --> 23:36.800
Oh, no.

23:36.800 --> 23:40.000
You'd make my, don't bud, come on.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.520
Don't make my business explode.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.480
So on Thursday, I went to a Halloween party

23:44.480 --> 23:49.120
being hosted by a club at my college in full Druid costume.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.040
Very cool mask, the works.

23:51.920 --> 23:55.120
About 45 minutes in, I was informed by a sheepish gentleman

23:55.120 --> 23:59.920
it was, in fact, a club only party, not one hosted by the club.

23:59.920 --> 24:03.440
And I had drastically misunderstood the situation.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.840
Thank God I had not eaten any of their food yet,

24:05.840 --> 24:09.200
and I made a rapid escape, absolutely mortified.

24:10.320 --> 24:10.820
Wow.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.080
Well, hold on.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.280
I need just like one second.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.200
There's a lot of, yeah, I'm a, I'm a-

24:15.200 --> 24:16.880
That is like, so brittle.

24:16.880 --> 24:17.680
Oh, God.

24:17.680 --> 24:23.680
Oh, that's from, my question is, how do I retrieve my skin?

24:23.680 --> 24:25.920
My question is, how do I retrieve my skeleton

24:25.920 --> 24:29.600
from when it jetpacked directly into the sun and recover?

24:29.600 --> 24:30.800
And that's from question,

24:30.800 --> 24:33.600
worst social anxiety situation ever?

24:33.600 --> 24:37.760
Question mark, no, exclamation point, friend.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.520
That's definitely one of the worst things I've ever-

24:41.520 --> 24:45.520
There couldn't be a worse, unless they were like,

24:45.520 --> 24:48.000
unless, the only way this could have gone worse

24:48.000 --> 24:51.200
is if they'd been like, excuse me, it's,

24:51.200 --> 24:53.200
and you're like, oh, sorry, club only party?

24:53.200 --> 24:56.320
A funeral, actually, is what you've arrived at as a funeral.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.080
And it's a club only funeral.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.160
It's a club, also it's a club only funeral,

25:00.160 --> 25:01.600
and you're not welcome.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.560
That's the thing, every, every place I go, I'm waiting,

25:04.560 --> 25:07.840
my fear is, I'm waiting in fear for someone to walk up and say,

25:07.840 --> 25:09.840
you're not supposed to be here.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.080
Oh, I can't, I cannot tell you how far

25:12.080 --> 25:13.760
this would set me back as a person.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.000
Yeah.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.880
It's like every, it's been such small increments

25:16.880 --> 25:20.000
in not getting told that I don't belong at any one,

25:20.000 --> 25:24.400
and like, I cannot think of a situation

25:24.400 --> 25:26.320
that line would not work on me.

25:26.320 --> 25:29.200
Especially if I was in costume, that's the thing.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.800
Like, you're not supposed to be here,

25:30.800 --> 25:32.720
and also you clearly spent a lot of time

25:32.720 --> 25:34.000
putting that costume together,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.920
and you're also not supposed to be here.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.320
Like, okay, bye, I'm a hermit now.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.960
I, if we were doing a live show,

25:41.520 --> 25:44.320
and my face was on the marquee of the venue,

25:44.320 --> 25:47.520
and someone was like, actually, you're not supposed to be here,

25:47.520 --> 25:50.000
I would immediately leave and just assume

25:50.000 --> 25:52.240
you guys hired Dustin Diamond or something.

25:52.240 --> 25:55.040
Yeah, Juice, that's who we, yeah, Juice, yeah, Juice.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.720
Good pool, good pool.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.720
Travis, luckily, even though it was a bad pool,

26:02.720 --> 26:03.600
you said pool.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.000
I did.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.520
And so we can all focus on that.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.520
Yeah, I'm saying cool first.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.680
This reminds me, this occurrence reminds me

26:09.680 --> 26:13.360
of one of my favorite Brent and Travis College stories,

26:13.360 --> 26:15.440
which is, we were trying to branch out,

26:15.440 --> 26:17.520
and meet new people outside of the theater department,

26:17.520 --> 26:21.440
so we went to a party in the science and engineering building

26:22.000 --> 26:23.680
with all the science and engineering kids.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.480
They're all very nice.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.000
We knew nobody.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.680
I knew nobody there.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.520
We were moving around the room,

26:29.520 --> 26:31.200
introducing ourselves, making new friends.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.000
We were thirsty.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.760
We saw a 12-pack of Mountain Dew.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.920
We broke into it, got two Mountain Dews out.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.200
Oh, what a party we said.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.720
And then, about 20, 30 minutes later,

26:40.720 --> 26:43.200
they announced that the auction would be starting

26:43.200 --> 26:45.280
to raise money for the science and engineering,

26:45.280 --> 26:47.360
department, and the first item of forbid,

26:47.360 --> 26:50.480
a 12-pack of Mountain Dew.

26:50.480 --> 26:54.000
Now, in our defense, not a good auction item.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.960
No, please tell me you just bought the whole thing

26:56.960 --> 26:57.680
to make up for your sins.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.960
No, we ran away.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.160
For two Mountain Dews, that is actually the most,

27:02.720 --> 27:04.560
a lot of people say the quintessential college story

27:04.560 --> 27:07.040
is like, yeah, I got so fucked up and barfed on a,

27:08.160 --> 27:10.880
you know, barfed on my dad,

27:10.880 --> 27:14.160
but I stole two Mountain Dews and ruined a party

27:14.160 --> 27:17.600
because of it is actually more sort of my kind of experience.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.880
So I'm right there with you.

27:19.440 --> 27:20.960
Can I do something real quick?

27:21.760 --> 27:23.200
I'm gonna reach down here.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.720
I'm gonna take off my shoe

27:25.360 --> 27:27.440
and I'm gonna put it right on the other foot.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.480
Oh no, it doesn't fit good

27:28.480 --> 27:29.440
because that's not how shoes work,

27:29.440 --> 27:31.840
but I want you all to envision

27:33.520 --> 27:36.560
that you are in this club or perhaps the president

27:36.560 --> 27:39.120
or consigliere of this club,

27:39.920 --> 27:41.440
and you are throwing this party

27:41.440 --> 27:42.880
and all the club members are there

27:42.880 --> 27:44.480
and you're having a great time.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.680
And then a person you don't know shows up dressed up

27:47.680 --> 27:52.720
as a druid and starts just sort of milling about.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.160
Do you think you would have the gumption,

27:58.160 --> 28:00.400
the gumbo to walk up to them and say,

28:00.400 --> 28:01.280
get out of here?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.840
Griffin, I don't know that I would have the gumption

28:03.840 --> 28:05.840
to do that if somebody walked into my house

28:05.840 --> 28:07.360
dressed like a druid,

28:07.360 --> 28:09.360
let alone a party I was throwing.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.160
Now druid costume, I feel like the fact that you say

28:12.160 --> 28:13.680
very cool mask that works

28:13.680 --> 28:15.120
kind of paints a picture in my mind.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.800
If it was just druid costume,

28:16.800 --> 28:19.200
I feel like that is abstract enough that I would not.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.480
But I'm imagining sort of,

28:20.480 --> 28:21.440
we're dealing with a mask,

28:21.440 --> 28:22.400
we're dealing with a cool mask

28:22.400 --> 28:24.400
and we're dealing with a robe, almost definitely.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.400
I cannot imagine a druidic sort of garb

28:26.400 --> 28:27.680
without a robe involved.

28:27.680 --> 28:30.800
Person you don't know walks in with a robe and a mask.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.120
I cannot imagine asking them to leave the party

28:33.120 --> 28:36.560
without receiving some sort of Halloween,

28:36.560 --> 28:39.680
you know, spooky fright of some sort.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.840
Yeah, I do, by the way,

28:41.840 --> 28:43.200
my favorite part of this question is,

28:43.760 --> 28:47.040
thank God I hadn't eaten any of their food yet.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.040
Yeah, it's like the river sticks

28:49.040 --> 28:53.920
once you enter five gamma gammas spot

28:53.920 --> 28:55.360
and you taste of their apples,

28:55.360 --> 28:58.240
you are actually, now you're a pledge, I'm so sorry.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.120
We're gonna need you to leave,

28:59.120 --> 29:00.240
there's a club only event

29:00.240 --> 29:02.240
and you are going to need to reimburse us

29:02.240 --> 29:03.840
for those five peel and eat shrimp.

29:05.200 --> 29:09.120
It is a horrid, think about this for a second.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.960
You see someone in a robe

29:11.760 --> 29:14.400
and they're wearing a very scary mask

29:15.040 --> 29:16.560
and then you go up to them

29:16.560 --> 29:20.240
and you're like, hey, sorry, bud, club members only.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.760
I don't know if you've ever seen a horror movie,

29:23.760 --> 29:25.760
but you're about to get stabbed.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.800
You have definitely entered like a stabbable situation

29:30.800 --> 29:32.320
with that sort of pull.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.840
I don't know how usable this information is,

29:35.840 --> 29:38.400
but if this ever happens again to anyone listening,

29:38.400 --> 29:41.200
just slowly turn your head to face them,

29:41.200 --> 29:43.120
say nothing, look at them.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.840
Or sort of croak like a, oh.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.840
Yeah, and then just like walk past them

29:47.840 --> 29:50.320
as though you didn't register what they said

29:50.320 --> 29:52.480
and then about five minutes after that, you can leave.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.680
You turned and ran away

29:55.680 --> 29:59.520
and that is what anybody hosting this podcast now

29:59.520 --> 30:01.280
would have done, definitely, I feel you.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.600
But did you consider maybe the other option

30:03.600 --> 30:04.640
of something else you could do,

30:04.640 --> 30:07.840
which is you just turn into a bunch of bees

30:07.840 --> 30:09.760
or turn them into a bunch of bees?

30:09.760 --> 30:11.680
Did you even think about turning them into bees

30:11.680 --> 30:12.720
or yourself into bees?

30:14.240 --> 30:21.840
Did you consider maybe I'd like to pursue membership now?

30:22.560 --> 30:26.800
Yeah, I'm in your club in the future, hi.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.360
I wanted to make a big impression on you

30:32.160 --> 30:33.920
so I could get in your club.

30:33.920 --> 30:39.680
Why was this party advertised?

30:39.680 --> 30:41.280
Why did you know about it?

30:41.280 --> 30:42.480
Why did you know about it?

30:42.480 --> 30:44.560
Why would they put up a flyer?

30:44.560 --> 30:49.520
It's like sweet party, costume a must, no outsiders.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.320
No druids.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.560
No druids allowed.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.840
What if you had lifted your mask

30:53.840 --> 30:55.520
and your face was their face?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.440
I think that would be the best response to it.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.720
Club members only, boom.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.120
You're club members only,

31:01.120 --> 31:03.120
you open up your bunch of skeleton bones.

31:03.120 --> 31:03.920
Could you do it?

31:03.920 --> 31:04.640
Could you do that?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.160
Next time this happens to you,

31:08.160 --> 31:09.920
when you take your mask off,

31:09.920 --> 31:12.000
it should be the person that tells you to leave

31:12.000 --> 31:13.360
but 30 years older.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.960
And they're like, I've come to warn you.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.920
And make it clear they've seen some shit.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.880
It's gone downhill since this party

31:22.880 --> 31:24.080
where they kicked you out.

31:24.720 --> 31:25.600
Don't kick me out.

31:25.600 --> 31:28.000
If you do, things will go very terribly for you.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.360
And then they're like, okay, cool.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.480
Have some Mountain Dew.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.440
And you say, all right.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.280
And then you stay, you have a good time,

31:33.280 --> 31:34.560
and now you turn into a bunch of bees.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.480
I just really want that to happen.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.600
You do have to turn into bees.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.080
One way or the other.

31:38.080 --> 31:41.120
At some point, it's not a party

31:41.120 --> 31:43.600
unless someone turns into a bunch of bees.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.240
Yeah, that's what our grandma always said.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.080
As mortifying as this would have been,

31:49.040 --> 31:52.960
on some level, it had to be a relief

31:52.960 --> 31:56.880
because I could think of maybe three parties

31:56.880 --> 32:00.400
in my entire life where if someone had walked up to me

32:00.400 --> 32:02.560
and said, you have to leave now,

32:02.560 --> 32:04.320
I would kind of be like, oh, thank God.

32:05.920 --> 32:06.400
Oh, great.

32:06.960 --> 32:07.360
Cool.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.560
Thank you so much.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.280
That's excellent.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.640
That's excellent news.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.960
Justin, I'm curious about a thing you said.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.520
Do you think, Justin, you've ever turned into bees

32:15.520 --> 32:18.080
at a party that you maybe even threw?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.720
Maybe you threw a party and you're like,

32:20.720 --> 32:22.560
oh, boy, anxiety is a little high.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.200
Time for bees.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.720
And you turn into bees to get out of there?

32:25.440 --> 32:27.920
I've wished for that ability.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.560
I know I don't have that ability

32:30.560 --> 32:33.840
because I've tried so hard to turn into bees

32:33.840 --> 32:36.160
so many different times and it has never worked.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.160
Oh, don't abuse the power.

32:38.160 --> 32:38.960
Don't abuse the power.

32:38.960 --> 32:39.760
It's got to be in situations where-

32:39.760 --> 32:41.120
When it's right, you'll know.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.800
I do like that Griffin, for you, turning into bees

32:44.800 --> 32:46.960
is synonymous with making a quiet exit.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.720
Well, hold on.

32:48.720 --> 32:51.280
Because now I tore my pants earlier.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.480
This sounds like another challenge.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.360
I'm going to sit here real hard.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.560
I'm going to try to turn into bees.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.480
Travis, count me down.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.520
Okay, three, two, one, bees.

33:06.160 --> 33:06.660
Fuck.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.040
I just turned into one big bee.

33:11.200 --> 33:15.360
Well, that always means it's time to go to the money zone.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.280
Or should we say the honey zone?

33:17.280 --> 33:20.400
I got honey dripping out of my stinger and everything

33:20.400 --> 33:32.160
like bees do, I think.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.160
Our first sponsor this week is pollen.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.200
I love scooping it up and shitting it out

33:37.200 --> 33:39.520
into that good stuff that people put in their tea.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.800
No, it's just Harry's.

33:40.800 --> 33:41.840
Harry's.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.600
You guys know my favorite cereals?

33:44.880 --> 33:46.960
Honey Nut Cheerios and Honeycomb.

33:46.960 --> 33:47.460
Yeah.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.520
And Honey Bunches of Oats.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.560
No, fuck that shit.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.680
Harry's is all about a great shave at a great price.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.360
There's no bees in any of this stuff.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.200
Do you have a Harry thorax?

33:59.200 --> 34:01.040
Sure, we all do.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.280
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy for Harry's,

34:03.280 --> 34:05.680
and we want to shave your bee butt or whatever.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.320
Harry's was started by two giant bees

34:08.320 --> 34:10.880
that were fed up with buying overpriced razors.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.760
So they bought a German factory with over 100 yards of blade

34:14.400 --> 34:16.800
making experience to ensure the highest quality.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.520
And over 100,000 bees.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.120
The smallest possible blades for the bees.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.680
They sell their blades online,

34:25.680 --> 34:27.920
and so they're able to cut the cost.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.320
That's not italicized like it's a joke,

34:30.320 --> 34:31.280
but it probably should be.

34:31.280 --> 34:31.600
Yeah.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.440
They're able to cut the cost of the middleman.

35:05.440 --> 35:05.760
Yes?

35:06.880 --> 35:09.360
Can I tell you about Zip Recruiter?

35:09.360 --> 35:09.680
Okay.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.000
Do you have a joke past that?

35:12.000 --> 35:15.280
Uh, I plan on being the rest of a bee

35:15.280 --> 35:17.040
for the rest of the podcast, Trav.

35:17.040 --> 35:17.760
Oh, okay.

35:17.760 --> 35:18.480
Yeah, that's the joke.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.240
Cause I've dedicated myself to being a bee

35:20.240 --> 35:20.960
for the rest of the podcast.

35:20.960 --> 35:21.520
Oh, okay.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.040
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.000
I don't know.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.360
I don't know how to replace it.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.600
I already got full dog body surgery

35:27.600 --> 35:28.080
and I don't know.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.200
I think I can't go.

35:29.200 --> 35:34.560
I have the punch card from Dr. Cool Body's surgery studio.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.840
So I guess I could go back in there

35:35.840 --> 35:37.120
and see if I could get a freebie.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.360
But anyways, Zip Recruiter, are you hiring?

35:39.360 --> 35:40.480

35:53.520 --> 35:54.880
One time spider almost got me.

Inhumation is a comedy drama web comic

36:45.360 --> 36:47.680
about dead teenagers burning in hell.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.120
And by burning in hell, I mean working a fast food job

36:51.120 --> 36:52.560
and going on awkward dates.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.920
The artist also does illustration commissions.

36:55.920 --> 37:00.560
So go to ivstudios.net slash Inhumation.

37:06.080 --> 37:09.920
So ivstudios.net slash Inhumation.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.400
You didn't do enough bee stuff in that one.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.360
Bees.

37:13.360 --> 37:13.920
Okay.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.960
Griffin, do this one.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.840
Why do I do it?

37:15.840 --> 37:17.360
Because there's a part about honeymoon

37:17.360 --> 37:18.240
and I thought that would be good.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.160
Okay, okay, okay, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.040
I'll edit this one out later, Greg.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.120
Who is this message for?

37:25.120 --> 37:26.240
It's for Caroline.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.680
And it's from Mike Tibbs in Sayley who says,

37:29.680 --> 37:31.680
happy birthday slash wedding day and or honeymoon

37:31.680 --> 37:32.800
to my favorite per-

37:32.800 --> 37:33.520
Fuck, hold on.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.000
Happy birthday slash wedding days and or honeymoon.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.200
Mm, sounds delicious.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.800
To my favorite, they don't eat the honey today.

37:38.800 --> 37:39.440
Let me try again.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.440
Happy birthday slash wedding day and or honeymoon.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.320
I make honey.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.760
To my favorite person in the world,

37:43.760 --> 37:45.600
here's to years and years of us watching TV and movies,

37:45.600 --> 37:47.600
playing video games, cuddling with the fur babies.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.960
I'm assuming that's bees.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.120
And whatever flavor adventures we find ourselves on.

37:51.120 --> 37:51.920
Best honey flavor.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.040
I love you.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.720
That's so sweet, like honey is.

37:54.720 --> 37:55.920
I need to help.

37:59.840 --> 38:00.800
I'm Hal Loveland.

38:00.800 --> 38:01.680
I'm Danielle Radford.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.720
I am Michael Eagle.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.320
And we are the hosts of Tights and Fights,

38:04.320 --> 38:08.080
Maximum Fun's newest podcast dedicated to all things wrestling.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.680
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks,

38:09.680 --> 38:11.920
the women's revolution, Sasha Banks,

38:11.920 --> 38:14.400
the brand split and Sasha Banks' wigs.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.720
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.720
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.480
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

38:20.480 --> 38:24.000
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.880
New episodes Thursdays on Maximum Fun

38:26.880 --> 38:28.880
or wherever you get your podcasts.

38:28.880 --> 38:42.160
Oh yeah, dig it.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.200
How about a Yahoo?

38:43.200 --> 38:43.600
Yeah.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.080
This is a good one from Jake Lousing.

38:46.080 --> 38:46.560
Thank you, Jake.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.080
It's Yahoo Answers user.

38:48.080 --> 38:54.480
Latanya asks, how to get slime off the ceiling?

38:54.480 --> 39:00.080
How to get slime off the ceiling?

39:00.080 --> 39:01.200
Additional details.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.840
Happy Halloween.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.400
That's for me.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.440
Very spooky.

39:05.440 --> 39:05.920
Okay.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.200
I want to say something.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.520
I'm a parent of a three-year-old.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.440
There's nothing funny about this question.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.600
This question is not funny at all.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.280
It's very serious.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.720
Because there's slime.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.760
Here's a question.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.560
How do I get slime out of my fucking house?

39:22.560 --> 39:26.640
My daughter likes to make slime with glue and contact solution

39:27.280 --> 39:30.560
and all manner of ungodly things.

39:30.560 --> 39:41.040
There's lard and glitter and the little foam beads

39:41.040 --> 39:42.160
that you put into things.

39:42.160 --> 39:42.640
It's a nightmare.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.200
Foam what?

39:44.080 --> 39:48.320
Like a little, you know, like micro fill, like micro beads

39:48.320 --> 39:50.000
that you would put in a bean bag or something.

39:50.640 --> 39:51.280
A bean bag?

39:51.280 --> 39:52.800
A bean bag.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.280
Sounds terrible.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.040
Don't put me in a bag.

39:57.040 --> 40:01.840
She likes to make a lot of it, not play with it,

40:01.840 --> 40:06.640
and then put it in a bag where it could be my problem forever.

40:06.640 --> 40:11.280
I've started like reverse contraband,

40:11.280 --> 40:14.400
trying to figure out ways that I can smuggle slime

40:15.120 --> 40:17.920
with other trashes that will not be detected.

40:17.920 --> 40:23.520
You just gotta eat a little bit, just a little bit at a time.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.440
Hide it behind Rita Hayworth, I think.

40:26.240 --> 40:26.560
Yeah.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.360
The slimy, slimy Rita Hayworth poster you've got.

40:30.080 --> 40:30.720
What's going on?

40:30.720 --> 40:31.520
You don't understand.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.720
There's a bunch of slime back there.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.080
Do not touch that poster, please.

40:34.080 --> 40:34.640
Please don't.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.760
This is for the good of everyone.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.920
I've been digging a hole to put the slime into.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.840
And Chris this morning, Charlie, come in here.

40:39.840 --> 40:40.080
What?

40:40.080 --> 40:40.800
It's just a poster.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.920
Yeah, rip.

40:41.920 --> 40:42.880
Slime deluge.

40:42.880 --> 40:43.520
Slime.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.760
Oh, Justin, is that the problem?

40:45.760 --> 40:46.800
Did you say, I don't know?

40:46.800 --> 40:47.600
No.

40:47.600 --> 40:48.960
Did you say, I don't know, Justin?

40:49.680 --> 40:51.520
That would get slime off the ceiling, right?

40:51.520 --> 40:51.920
Yeah.

40:51.920 --> 40:52.480
Can I ask you?

40:52.480 --> 40:54.800
If you stand underneath it, say, I don't know,

40:54.800 --> 40:56.000
and it'll fall right on there.

40:56.000 --> 40:56.640
Yeah.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.160
Was Rosie O'Donnell anywhere?

40:58.720 --> 41:00.080
Just sort of hiding,

41:00.080 --> 41:02.240
but also secretly hosting the Kids' Choice Awards.

41:02.880 --> 41:03.840
No, she was not.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.440
But can I just say,

41:07.440 --> 41:10.320
I think that you can't do that on television.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.000
Gag is really gonna land with our demo.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.480
Yeah.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.200
Appreciate that.

41:15.200 --> 41:18.720
How has that not had its own nostalgic resurgent?

41:18.720 --> 41:20.160
Like, I don't know.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.680
I feel like it should have hit, right?

41:22.240 --> 41:23.600
Let's do the hidden temple hit.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.400
Where's my Pete and Pete like rebirth?

41:26.400 --> 41:28.000
I would watch a, you can't do that.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.520
Oh no, I'm thinking of what would you do?

41:30.400 --> 41:31.120
Shit.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.560
Where's that what would you do rebirth?

41:32.560 --> 41:33.680
That was what I'm looking for.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.040
Just people opening up lockers

41:35.040 --> 41:36.640
and maybe there's a pine and maybe there's just slime,

41:36.640 --> 41:38.400
but maybe there's rollerblades.

41:38.400 --> 41:38.640
Yeah.

41:38.640 --> 41:42.240
Okay, now is what would you do the one with John Quinones?

41:42.240 --> 41:42.480
Yes.

41:42.480 --> 41:43.360
Or is that the up?

41:43.360 --> 41:45.360
That's the one where John Quinones puts people

41:45.360 --> 41:47.120
in awkward situations in real life

41:47.120 --> 41:48.400
to see how they respond to them.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.280
And if they do a good job,

41:49.280 --> 41:50.800
he lets them go to the prize lockers.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.760
And sometimes there's a gag in there

41:53.760 --> 41:55.040
and sometimes there's a floam in there,

41:55.040 --> 41:56.880
but sometimes there's a, you know,

41:56.880 --> 41:59.120
tickets to Universal Studios Orlando, Florida,

41:59.120 --> 42:01.600
where they can go and catch a new episode

42:01.600 --> 42:03.920
of the Mystery Files of Shelby Woo.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.040
Or catch a predator.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.000
Or catch a predator.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.680
Was that Quinones?

42:07.680 --> 42:07.840
No.

42:08.720 --> 42:09.200
Was it?

42:09.920 --> 42:11.280
No, that was Shelby Woo did that.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.000
She hosted.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.400
She hosted to catch a predator?

42:14.400 --> 42:15.200
Yeah, the fictional character did.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.160
Okay, horrible news.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.480
What would you do is in fact the name

42:18.480 --> 42:20.080
of the show with John Quinones

42:20.640 --> 42:24.320
and the game show with Mark Summers.

42:24.320 --> 42:24.560
Yeah.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.640
I'm not gonna change it.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.440
They have to change it.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.680
That show's been off the air for a long time, John.

42:29.680 --> 42:30.160
I don't care.

42:30.160 --> 42:30.960
I'm not changing it.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.560
Now, John Quinones, have you considered putting

42:32.560 --> 42:34.960
maybe even a little bit of gag in your situations?

42:34.960 --> 42:37.040
Just to sort of serve as a narrative thread.

42:37.040 --> 42:37.920
Just so what?

42:37.920 --> 42:40.400
Oh, this army vet lost his wallet

42:40.400 --> 42:42.240
and also his gag.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.560
Now, in order for this to be fair use,

42:44.560 --> 42:46.160
it had to legally be a remake.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.880
So for the last three minutes of the show,

42:48.880 --> 42:51.120
I'm not gonna put any strangers in awkward situations.

42:51.120 --> 42:53.040
I'm just gonna throw a pie at my dad.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.640
That is how every episode of the Mark Summers

42:56.640 --> 42:58.240
will end in.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.880
How do we get this fucking slime off the ceiling though?

43:00.880 --> 43:01.920
And I put this one on here

43:01.920 --> 43:03.680
because maybe I thought it'd be a spooky Halloween one.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.440
I didn't know it would reverberate with Justin

43:05.440 --> 43:07.040
quite as much as it did.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.320
Yeah, it is scary to me.

43:08.320 --> 43:08.960
I will say that.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.280
I'm sitting here spooked.

43:11.280 --> 43:14.480
Why doesn't your daughter just have one slime?

43:14.480 --> 43:16.240
I don't understand the need for more slime.

43:16.240 --> 43:17.920
She doesn't wanna play with it.

43:17.920 --> 43:18.800
Wants to make it.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.760
But then you're not allowed to throw it away?

43:21.760 --> 43:23.280
But then I can't throw it away.

43:23.280 --> 43:23.760
Because it's a gift.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.760
So she makes it and keeps it

43:26.400 --> 43:28.240
and then that's it.

43:28.240 --> 43:29.920
What I should try to get her to do

43:30.800 --> 43:31.920
is start selling it.

43:31.920 --> 43:33.280
Maybe I could put her to work

43:33.280 --> 43:37.360
in that sort of junior achievement sort of situation

43:37.360 --> 43:38.800
where she's just like making the slime

43:38.800 --> 43:40.880
and then putting it in little containers

43:40.880 --> 43:42.400
and selling it to buy food.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.920
What if you started storing it in a very large lock box

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
and then on her 18th birthday,

43:47.920 --> 43:49.280
you wheeled it out and said,

43:49.280 --> 43:51.200
this is where your college money went.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.400
Yeah, to this nice slime box.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.560
Yeah, this is, well, I mean, the money,

43:56.560 --> 43:57.360
I don't know what,

43:57.360 --> 43:59.520
but you're talking about contact solution and glue.

43:59.520 --> 44:00.560
That ain't cheap.

44:00.560 --> 44:02.000
Contact solution isn't cheap.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.280
So like, I don't know how many thousands of dollars a week

44:05.280 --> 44:07.760
you're spending on slime fixings,

44:07.760 --> 44:10.800
but it can't be cheap.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.000
Are you okay, Justin?

44:13.040 --> 44:14.240
How are you doing with your money?

44:14.960 --> 44:15.920
Are you poor now?

44:16.480 --> 44:17.600
It's not pricey.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.560
I mean, it's Elmer's glue.

44:18.560 --> 44:19.680
It's contact solution.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.760
No, don't give out the recipe here.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.480
Are you crazy?

44:24.800 --> 44:25.280
Why not?

44:26.160 --> 44:27.120
If I give out the recipe

44:27.120 --> 44:28.480
and there's a huge rush on it,

44:28.480 --> 44:30.560
maybe I won't be able to find the ingredients at the store.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.360
What if everybody in our whole listening audience,

44:33.360 --> 44:36.080
here's the recipe you give out, makes their own slime,

44:36.080 --> 44:38.400
slime gets big and strong, takes over the whole world

44:38.400 --> 44:40.000
and spreads and consumes all of us.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
And then that one's on you, Juice.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.480
There are certain ratios of the slime recipe

44:46.480 --> 44:49.840
that turn it into a fun slime for the whole family

44:49.840 --> 44:52.240
that does not stick to your furniture.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.920
And then there's other ratios

44:53.920 --> 44:56.960
where it's basically a furniture destruction kit

44:56.960 --> 45:00.640
where it's like, I just wanna destroy this ottoman forever

45:00.640 --> 45:03.120
and this is the slime that I've made to do it.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.960
Juice, I got a great idea for you.

45:04.960 --> 45:05.760
What's that?

45:05.760 --> 45:06.960
You get Charlie and you say,

45:06.960 --> 45:08.400
all right, new slime recipe time.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.160
And this one's gonna be a lot of fun.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.800
And you say, Terry, take this ground beef

45:12.800 --> 45:15.680
and you take these onions and some minced garlic

45:15.680 --> 45:19.680
and chili powder, salt and some oregano and stewed tomatoes.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.040
And then, oh, you're gonna love this.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.320
It makes it all sticky and fun.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.720
Some tomato sauce and some kidney beans.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.920
And we'll put them in this crock pile,

45:25.920 --> 45:27.920
make the most fun slime.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.960
But then at the end of the day, you say,

45:30.960 --> 45:32.640
it's like, guys, it's gonna take eight hours

45:32.640 --> 45:33.840
and we're gonna turn this to high

45:33.840 --> 45:35.600
because that's how the slime gets the best.

45:35.600 --> 45:39.600
And then at the end of the day, you just got chili, baby.

45:39.600 --> 45:40.800
Edible slime.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.000
Chili is just edible slime, my man.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.520
Chili is just edible slime.

45:43.520 --> 45:46.240
But oh, what a good and delicious prank to pull.

45:46.240 --> 45:49.040
And then you don't have the slime problem anymore.

45:49.040 --> 45:50.640
And then all of a sudden now,

45:50.640 --> 45:55.280
she's on MasterChef Junior, but she can only make chili.

45:55.280 --> 45:59.920
Today, you're going to make my most electable beef Wellington.

45:59.920 --> 46:01.200
Charlie, let's see what you've got.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.200
Oh, it's chili again.

46:03.920 --> 46:07.200
Well, it's very good chili.

46:07.200 --> 46:10.800
It's good chili and God, gosh dang it, you're cute.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.360
Let's get rid of an ugly boy.

46:16.800 --> 46:19.120
But my crust is so flaky.

46:19.120 --> 46:19.920
Yeah, I don't care.

46:20.640 --> 46:21.600
You're gone.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.600
But I'm also British.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.600
Now, Charlie, here this time,

46:25.600 --> 46:30.320
I see you just sort of dollop chili into cupcake wrappers.

46:30.320 --> 46:33.840
You know that that's not a cupcake, right?

46:33.840 --> 46:36.240
I mean, that's chili still.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.400
And my sweet Charlie, what do you call this?

46:38.400 --> 46:38.900
Slime.

46:40.000 --> 46:40.500
Okay.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.000
Daddy's slime.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.200
Daddy's slime.

46:43.200 --> 46:43.680
Okay.

46:43.680 --> 46:46.720
I think that considering chili is one of the three foods I can eat,

46:46.720 --> 46:47.600
that's probably good.

46:47.600 --> 46:49.280
The jig's gonna be up pretty quick.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.480
I had to look up an all recipes chili recipe

46:54.480 --> 46:57.120
to name all those ingredients, by the way.

46:57.120 --> 46:58.800
And now I'm just looking at pictures of chili

46:58.800 --> 47:00.800
and just having some sweet daydreams.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.040
Justin, read the next question.

47:03.840 --> 47:04.880
Oh, all right, Trav.

47:04.880 --> 47:05.520
No problem.

47:05.520 --> 47:06.560
I'm hungry for chili now.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.760
I need to get this show done

47:07.760 --> 47:10.800
and we got a three question minimum before we can wrap up.

47:10.800 --> 47:11.600
Okay.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.880
This next one's weird.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.040
For as long as I can remember,

47:15.040 --> 47:16.960
my dad has been afraid of loose buttons,

47:17.520 --> 47:19.840
like the ones you would sew onto a shirt.

47:19.840 --> 47:22.640
He refuses to be near them or interact with them in any way.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.480
However, he's completely fine with buttons

47:24.480 --> 47:25.520
that are attached to clothing.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.320
My mother also sews frequently.

47:28.320 --> 47:30.800
So there's a large amount of loose buttons around their house.

47:30.800 --> 47:31.280
Perfect.

47:31.840 --> 47:34.240
How can I help my dad overcome his fear

47:34.240 --> 47:35.600
of small plastic circles?

47:35.600 --> 47:38.400
And that's from disconcerted descendant in Decatur.

47:39.280 --> 47:41.520
The real Sam and Diane situation going on here.

47:42.080 --> 47:43.680
No, can't you boys see?

47:44.320 --> 47:45.520
Can't you see the truth here?

47:46.720 --> 47:48.080
Look at the pieces.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.280
Put the pieces together.

47:49.280 --> 47:50.400
I had the clues the whole time.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.360
I could have saved her.

47:51.360 --> 47:52.880
You had the clues the whole time, lol?

47:53.520 --> 47:54.400
The buttons.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.880
The mother likes to sew buttons, right?

47:56.880 --> 47:58.720
Hey, honey, will you sew this button on a shirt?

47:58.720 --> 47:59.200
I can't.

47:59.200 --> 48:00.960
I'm afraid of loose buttons.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.600
What?

48:01.600 --> 48:02.320
Yeah.

48:02.320 --> 48:03.520
Committed to that.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.680
That, like, the father-

48:05.680 --> 48:08.560
You're saying the dad doesn't want to sew so badly

48:08.560 --> 48:11.360
that he says he's afraid of-

48:11.360 --> 48:12.560
A fear of loose buttons.

48:12.560 --> 48:15.760
Like, I say I'm afraid of the noise that the weed whacker makes.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.320
And so I just won't go near it because it scares me so bad.

48:18.320 --> 48:18.560
So it's sort of like,

48:19.360 --> 48:22.160
honey, the button fell off my favorite Oxford.

48:22.160 --> 48:23.840
Can you sew it back on for me?

48:23.840 --> 48:24.960
I'll get around to it.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.240
But I'm freaking out!

48:26.240 --> 48:27.040
Yeah.

48:27.040 --> 48:27.840
Help!

48:27.840 --> 48:28.880
Please do it now!

48:29.440 --> 48:31.440
It's just sitting there, mocking me!

48:31.440 --> 48:31.940
Look at it!

48:33.200 --> 48:34.720
It's gonna eat me or whatever.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.120
It looks like a very bad plate.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.720
A very small, bad plate.

48:38.720 --> 48:41.680
What if it gets sucked up in the vacuum and breaks it?

48:41.680 --> 48:42.800
That's terrifying.

48:43.440 --> 48:47.840
It's kind of like how I'm afraid of distortions in the world's electromagnetic field.

48:48.480 --> 48:50.240
Because it throws off all my receptors.

48:51.840 --> 48:52.340
Shit.

48:52.340 --> 48:52.840
Um...

48:55.940 --> 48:56.900
Throw away all the buttons!

48:56.900 --> 48:59.300
Like, throw away all the buttons or put them in a special button box.

48:59.300 --> 49:00.900
If your dad says, here's a button.

49:00.900 --> 49:07.460
Your dad worked so hard to, you know, send you to dentist school or seminary.

49:07.460 --> 49:08.980
The only two schools there are.

49:08.980 --> 49:12.180
And the least you could do is when you hear him yelling and yelling and yelling,

49:12.180 --> 49:14.820
you go and you pick up the small button and you put him in the button box.

49:14.820 --> 49:15.940
This is not that-

49:15.940 --> 49:18.340
If this is your dad's thing, there's not-

49:18.340 --> 49:19.860
There are worse things.

49:19.860 --> 49:20.980
There are worse things.

49:20.980 --> 49:24.740
You do have to think of it when it says loose, but it's not like buttons on the loose, right?

49:24.740 --> 49:28.420
It's like even if they're in a container, it is still a loose button.

49:28.420 --> 49:31.300
You just put them in a closet or he doesn't know where they are.

49:31.300 --> 49:33.140
But here's the thing, right?

49:33.140 --> 49:34.820
I'm afraid of spiders, right?

49:35.380 --> 49:36.900
I've told my wife this many times.

49:36.900 --> 49:41.220
And if my wife was like, no, I'm still going to keep an old cookie tin full of spiders.

49:41.220 --> 49:44.340
That's the most buck wild thing you've ever fucking said, Travis.

49:44.980 --> 49:46.340
But that's what's going on here.

49:46.340 --> 49:47.940
Your dad's like, I'm scared of buttons.

49:47.940 --> 49:49.220
And mom's like, cool, cool, cool.

49:49.220 --> 49:50.980
Here's my big thing of buttons.

49:51.620 --> 49:54.580
Yeah, but she probably isn't mean about it like that.

49:54.580 --> 49:57.300
Now, I will say you could be.

49:57.940 --> 50:02.900
You could have essentially what I would consider to be a human no-no can.

50:03.540 --> 50:08.180
If your dad starts acting up or, you know, maybe he tells an embarrassing story at a wedding

50:08.180 --> 50:14.100
or a graduation party or a, you know, seminary graduation party,

50:14.100 --> 50:15.860
then you just get out the no-no can.

50:15.860 --> 50:16.500
And you don't even-

50:16.500 --> 50:18.740
I think at a certain point, you don't even have to shake it anymore.

50:18.740 --> 50:19.220
He sees it.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.100
He knows what's in there.

50:20.100 --> 50:20.500
Buttons.

50:20.500 --> 50:21.300
He knows what he did.

50:21.300 --> 50:22.100
He knows what he did.

50:22.100 --> 50:23.140
Well, you don't even need that.

50:23.140 --> 50:25.460
You just start tugging at a button on your shirt.

50:25.460 --> 50:26.980
Like, oh, feels a little loose.

50:26.980 --> 50:28.740
And then your dad like runs away.

50:28.740 --> 50:29.060
Yeah.

50:29.060 --> 50:32.660
I, you, your dad, I kind of have to side with Griffin here.

50:32.660 --> 50:34.740
Your dad has been through a lot raising you.

50:34.740 --> 50:42.740
And I guarantee as a child, you had fears and concerns that were far more rational

50:42.740 --> 50:44.020
than loose buttons.

50:44.020 --> 50:48.820
Yesterday, my daughter screamed, literally screamed for 15 minutes

50:48.820 --> 50:51.940
because I flushed a poop of hers before her mommy could see it.

50:52.580 --> 50:59.060
And that was 15 minutes of that because she really wanted mom to come in and see the-

50:59.060 --> 51:01.140
Mommy wasn't there at the moment.

51:01.140 --> 51:06.180
So it would have been sort of a museum piece for a little while.

51:07.700 --> 51:09.780
But still, I shouldn't have flushed it.

51:09.780 --> 51:14.980
So like you've done, like you had worse things than loose buttons when you were a kid

51:14.980 --> 51:18.260
and your dad didn't, didn't, you know, try to throw them in your face.

51:18.260 --> 51:19.700
So don't throw loose buttons at your dad.

51:19.700 --> 51:20.900
In his face, unless.

51:22.980 --> 51:23.460
Unless.

51:23.460 --> 51:23.940
Unless.

51:27.540 --> 51:32.820
You can set up the best, most effective, and most cost-efficient haunted house

51:34.740 --> 51:36.180
that has ever been devised.

51:36.180 --> 51:39.140
And they just walk into the house

51:39.140 --> 51:43.060
and there's no decorations or spooky lighting or a, you know, chainsaw man,

51:43.060 --> 51:45.140
but there's no chain on it because we're just having fun here.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.900
It's just you and your standby or laptop plugged into

51:49.460 --> 51:53.220
maybe 14 speakers arranged all in a circle around the room.

51:53.220 --> 51:54.260
Door will lock behind him.

51:54.260 --> 51:55.940
You're gonna need mom's help with that one.

51:55.940 --> 51:56.500
Get your mom.

51:56.500 --> 51:59.140
Hey kids, get your mom's help for this fun haunted house.

51:59.140 --> 52:05.300
And then you press play on Spotify and it is the Pussycat Dolls featuring Snoop Dogg's buttons.

52:05.300 --> 52:08.820
And then you just reach into just a big box you have

52:08.820 --> 52:10.820
and you just start letting those little guys fly.

52:11.540 --> 52:12.980
Can I tell you why I love this girl?

52:12.980 --> 52:13.780
One, it's a great idea.

52:13.780 --> 52:15.140
But two, I love the idea of-

52:15.140 --> 52:16.740
The song Pussycat Dolls, but-

52:16.740 --> 52:16.980
Yes.

52:16.980 --> 52:18.100
You did the buttons.

52:18.100 --> 52:22.660
I like the idea of a bespoke haunted house that is only meant for one per-

52:22.660 --> 52:30.660
Like, Derek, I heard you were afraid of, you know, the car from Knight Rider.

52:30.660 --> 52:33.220
And so like you walk in, I built you a whole haunted house

52:33.220 --> 52:36.100
that's just about the car from Knight Rider.

52:36.100 --> 52:40.500
I've put a lot of work and it's only going to be effective for one person.

52:40.500 --> 52:43.060
Yeah, I have Mr. Feeny here and he's gonna do the thing.

52:43.780 --> 52:48.100
Mine would be, so Justin, welcome.

52:48.100 --> 52:53.300
The door locks behind me and it is the robot woman from Superman 3

52:53.300 --> 52:57.060
standing in front of the old HBO logo as it flies across the screen.

52:57.860 --> 52:58.660
That would be very-

52:58.660 --> 52:59.220
Yeah, that would take me to town.

52:59.220 --> 53:04.900
But here's the thing, this doubles as fun Halloween fare and immersion therapy.

53:04.900 --> 53:09.140
I came out of a regular haunted house and I haven't been cured of my fear of mummies

53:09.140 --> 53:14.740
and generally being murdered by supernatural or natural forces.

53:15.300 --> 53:17.780
But after this sort of buttons gauntlet,

53:18.580 --> 53:21.940
after this sort of Pussycat Dolls torture chamber

53:21.940 --> 53:24.020
that you're locking your dad inside for a little bit,

53:26.020 --> 53:28.340
I think this problem's gonna solve itself.

53:28.340 --> 53:30.420
Griffin, what is your greatest fear?

53:31.220 --> 53:32.020
Mine?

53:32.020 --> 53:35.060
Yeah, I feel like Justin and I talk about our fears a lot on this show.

53:35.700 --> 53:38.980
Yeah, so I think that we, other than the intro,

53:38.980 --> 53:41.460
didn't say anything funny for the first 10 minutes of the podcast.

53:41.460 --> 53:44.660
And then we did a lot of B-talk that I think maybe overstated

53:44.660 --> 53:47.780
to welcome us by a significant margin.

53:47.780 --> 53:50.980
And I guess my biggest fear is all the tweets we're gonna get from people saying like,

53:50.980 --> 53:56.500
man, my Bim Bam is over or like, you know, I was excited that it wasn't gonna be

53:56.500 --> 53:58.740
another live episode because I hate those for some reason.

53:58.740 --> 54:03.300
But it was, there was just, all the B stuff didn't really connect with me.

54:05.060 --> 54:07.380
So you think the episode's gonna generate a lot of buzz?

54:11.700 --> 54:14.260
Well, that's gonna do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

54:14.260 --> 54:15.780
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

54:16.980 --> 54:22.340
Want to say a reminder to you that we are sort of,

54:22.340 --> 54:25.780
we've got the rest of the year like lined up ticket-wise.

54:25.780 --> 54:32.660
If you want to come see us live, you have basically two slim opportunities to do so.

54:32.660 --> 54:40.020
The first is in Chicago on the 16th at the Chicago Theater.

54:40.020 --> 54:44.180
And the next is in Milwaukee, November 19th at the Riverside Theater.

54:44.900 --> 54:49.780
You can find links to both of those McElroy shows dot com slash tours.

54:49.780 --> 54:54.740
There is a third option.

54:55.940 --> 54:56.500
What's that?

54:57.060 --> 54:58.580
PodCon.

54:58.580 --> 54:59.140
Oh, that's right.

54:59.140 --> 55:00.260
PodCon for sure.

55:00.260 --> 55:00.580
Yeah.

55:00.580 --> 55:01.540
Good point, Trav.

55:01.540 --> 55:04.660
December 9th and 10th in Seattle.

55:04.660 --> 55:09.380
We're all, so we're going to be doing an NBNB AM and also an Adventure Zone Q&A.

55:09.380 --> 55:12.500
Also like we'll be participating in a bunch of different things.

55:12.500 --> 55:17.700
Also there is gonna be Welcome to Night Vale, Last Name Basis, John and Hank Green.

55:17.700 --> 55:24.900
Let's see, Sawbones, Still Buffering, a bunch of things.

55:24.900 --> 55:30.180
And you can find out the whole lineup at podcon.com.

55:30.180 --> 55:35.220
Tickets are still available and there is also an option even if you aren't able to attend

55:35.220 --> 55:40.500
where you will be able to hear everything later, like in a remote attendance thing.

55:40.500 --> 55:44.660
So go check that out at podcon.com and we hope to see you there.

55:44.660 --> 55:47.460
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

55:47.460 --> 55:49.780
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

55:49.780 --> 55:53.780
It's an extremely spooky album that gives me horrible nightmares.

55:53.780 --> 55:56.180
Well, no, it's not.

55:56.180 --> 55:57.940
I also want to thank Maximum Fun for having us.

55:57.940 --> 56:02.340
You can go to MaximumFun.org slash Jumbotrons because they are going to go on sale this

56:02.340 --> 56:04.660
week to get Jumbotrons on the show.

56:04.660 --> 56:07.860
They're going to be selling them for the first six months of 2018.

56:07.860 --> 56:09.300
They're going on sale November 1st.

56:09.300 --> 56:11.860
That's this Wednesday at 11 a.m. Pacific time.

56:11.860 --> 56:15.940
And I promise you they will sell out, so if you want to get a message on the show or any

56:15.940 --> 56:20.900
of our podcasts for the first half of 2018, make sure you lock down your spot this Wednesday,

56:20.900 --> 56:22.260
November 11th at 11 a.m.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.220
Pacific time.

56:23.220 --> 56:25.140
Maximum Fun.org slash Jumbotron.

56:25.140 --> 56:33.620
Speaking of November 1st, at Joseph Beth Booksellers here in Cincinnati, I am going to be moderating

56:33.620 --> 56:39.620
an event, a book, reading and signing with the new Welcome to Night Vale book.

56:39.620 --> 56:45.540
With Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor, the book is It Devours.

56:45.540 --> 56:47.540
Justin did the last one, so I get to do this one.

56:47.540 --> 56:50.820
She last time asked me to do that, and I guess I must not have...

56:50.820 --> 56:52.820
Well, now I live in Cincinnati.

56:52.820 --> 56:53.860
Hmm.

56:53.860 --> 56:58.180
But that's going to be Wednesday night at Joseph Beth Booksellers, I believe seven o'clock.

56:58.180 --> 57:00.180
Hope to see you there.

57:00.180 --> 57:03.380
I have one more little plug, too.

57:03.380 --> 57:07.380
It's the Radiotopia Place Drive is going on.

57:07.380 --> 57:13.540
The Radiotopia Place Drive is going on right now, Radiotopia.fm.

57:13.540 --> 57:18.620
Our dear friend Roman Mars has a whole bunch of stone killers over there getting it done

57:18.620 --> 57:22.140
every day, and you should kick a few bucks their way if you like some of the great shows

57:22.140 --> 57:23.140
they do.

57:23.140 --> 57:24.140
So Radiotopia.fm.

57:24.140 --> 57:26.660
Here's that final Yahoo! is sent in by Kiersten.

57:26.660 --> 57:27.660
Thank you, Kiersten.

57:27.660 --> 57:28.660
It's Yahoo!

57:28.660 --> 57:29.660
Answer is user.

57:29.660 --> 57:30.660
Come on.

57:30.660 --> 57:31.660
Come on, baby.

57:31.660 --> 57:32.660
Come on, baby.

57:32.660 --> 57:34.660
Nope, it's not going to load.

57:34.660 --> 57:37.460
Roman Mars asked this, and it's really him.

57:37.460 --> 57:42.080
This is really Roman Mars, so I'm going to do his voice.

57:42.080 --> 57:45.540
Where does the noise from the doorbell come from?

57:45.540 --> 57:49.100
I'm Justin McElroy.

57:49.100 --> 57:50.340
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:50.340 --> 57:54.380
I'm Roman Mars, and this is going to be the worst episode 99% visible ever.

57:54.380 --> 57:55.380
I'm so sorry.

57:55.380 --> 58:13.460
I have no ideas.

58:13.460 --> 58:14.460
Maximum fun.org.

58:14.460 --> 58:16.060
Comedy and culture.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.060
Artist-owned.

58:17.060 --> 58:18.060
Listener-supported.

58:18.060 --> 58:21.100
Hey there, folks.

58:21.100 --> 58:25.460
I am writer and performer Dave Holmes, and I host International Waters, where we pair

58:25.460 --> 58:30.500
a team of comedians in LA against a team of comedians in London in a pop culture trivia

58:30.500 --> 58:32.100
battle royale.

58:32.100 --> 58:33.460
Comedians like Josie Long.

58:33.460 --> 58:38.700
I worry that it makes me seem like I'm 80 years old, but I hurt my knee, and it is just

58:38.700 --> 58:39.700
on the mend.

58:39.700 --> 58:41.500
And I can't tell you how delightful that feels.

58:41.500 --> 58:46.060
If I want to walk down some stairs, I just go for it now.

58:46.060 --> 58:47.060
Michaela Watkins.

58:47.060 --> 58:54.180
We have a country where our leaders actually deny global warming, so we are going to have

58:54.180 --> 58:59.380
more beachfront property than any other nation.

58:59.380 --> 59:02.340
I mean, it's going to shrink our country in half, but it's okay.

59:02.340 --> 59:04.420
But that's just more beach.

59:04.420 --> 59:05.420
And many more.

59:05.420 --> 59:09.140
Join us every other week on International Waters with me, Dave Holmes.

59:09.140 --> 59:18.020
