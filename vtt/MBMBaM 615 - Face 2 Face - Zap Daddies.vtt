00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
It's the start of something beautiful.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
A small acquaintance has blossomed, it's ripened into a precious friendship.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Hangs at the skatepark, hangs by the beach.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
My life, it feels like life.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
My life, oh, it's better with you.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother made advice show for the Madrin era.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
And now, your starting lineup.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Does anyone know the wifi password?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I'll share it with you, Griffin.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
And I'm the sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Hey, thanks.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
While they're doing that, this is perfect.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Hi, this is an advice show.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
And Boston, one of our favorite towns.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Like the Chilean miners before us, we have reemerged from the ground to be with you here.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
What a thrill it is to be back here.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Only now do I think about the fact that we didn't talk about what our intro was going to be.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh, I think we know what the intro is going to be.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Okay, so here's the deal.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I had a rough time getting here to your beautiful town.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Through no fault of yours, I assure you, unless you work at the airport, in which case, better luck next time.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Or if you control the weather.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
If you're a storm from the X-Men.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
So anyway, my flight got canceled.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I ended up being rerouted instead of going to Cincinnati, Boston.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I got rerouted to Cincinnati to Norfolk, Virginia.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Which actually made me further from Boston than when I started.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
At my house eight hours before.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
So, I take the, uh, I drive, I get a car, I drive up to Washington, D.C.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Show me how you drive. Show me one more time driving.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah, that's what it looks like when I do it.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Please don't drive like that.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
You and Muttley out there with the other wacky racers.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
I got up to Washington and then D.C. and then took the beautiful, uh, Acela train.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
All the way.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Beautiful steel beast.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
Anyone who's listened to Enough My Brother, specifically live shows, knows how rejuvenating a train ride can be.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So I'm having an amazing seven hour train ride up to Boston.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Loving it. Love it. Don't laugh. It's amazing.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
My kids aren't there.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I can't be clear enough about that.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm having the time of my life.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm catching up on Barry.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm ten steps from the soda and popcorn.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm living my best life.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Anyone who was here, I also have to say last night, Dad was not able to make it to the task show because of similar travel things.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
And in the middle of a thread of probably 200 texts as we're trying to figure this out.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Justin texts, I'm worried.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
And Paul, our stage manager slash tour manager says, Oh my God, what?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
And Justin says, I'm worried they'll make me get off the train when I get to Boston.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Um, don't take that as a slight.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
No city can measure up to a train.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
So I'm on the train. I'm about five hours in.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I decided to treat myself to perhaps my eighth bathroom break.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I'm right. It's for the DVTs.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
It's important to stay mobile.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
I go into the bathroom and I shut the door and a gentleman never tells.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
As one does, I go to leave the bathroom.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
The door does not open.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
And I try and I try to really pull.

04:39.000 --> 04:47.000
And then the claustrophobia starts really setting in really bad because I'm trapped in a bathroom on the train.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Um, and I'm pulling on the thing and then I noticed there's a button to call attendance.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
So I go, problem solved.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, problem solved, right?

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Can I ask how long you tried to get out of there yourself before you pressed the button specifically for getting trapped in the bathroom?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
45 seconds. I mean, actually longer than I would have thought.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
The panic was kicking in at this point because I was in a closed space.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah, the dilation of time.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Einstein talked about it when you're trapped in a train bathroom.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I'm leaning on the button and pressing the button. I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
No one's coming. I don't know if the button is creating a sustained noise or it's like I push it, it's on.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Just chill.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Did you try a few different patterns?

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
No one comes for about five minutes and I'm still in the bathroom and I'm starting to lose it pretty bad at this point, I'll be honest.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
And I start pounding on the doors, help, help, help.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
And I'm pounding, I'm pounding, I'm pounding.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Like in all my moving and jerking, I find that what has happened is the train has come off the track.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
No, not the train.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Sorry.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Holy shit.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
That was a pretty bad slip of the tongue.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
My apologies.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
So here's the thing, there's fire everywhere.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
No, no, no. So this doesn't happen. This was fine.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
The door, you know, the sliding door to the bathroom has come off the track. So I think, okay, well.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
The stakes of that sentence are so profoundly different.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
Because even if you arrive to the station trapped in a bathroom, you still got to the station.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
The distance between I was trapped with my own embarrassing doo-doo smell versus a hundred souls.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
So the door had come off the track through an impressive amount of Herculean effort.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
I lift the door up and get it back in its track, it pops right open.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Great.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Now I also have not thought about this the first time you told me this story, but also you must have closed it too hard, right?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
No, I closed it perfectly.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, what'd you do?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Everyone knows that I close bathroom doors great.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
You must have been so excited to do this.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Okay, so I open the door and I very coolly.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Walk back to my seat.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
Now I walk past someone who looks at me when I come out and it occurs to me.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
This must be very confusing for them because they're seated right next to the bathroom door.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
So in their experience, a husky boy walks into the bathroom.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
They hear a lot of pounding and screaming for help.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
And then same husky boy walks out of the bathroom, not a care in the world.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Now hold on.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Well, okay.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
So I was very concerned about what that person thought until I realized this motherfucker.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
There it is.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Listen to my cries of agony and terror and did nothing.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
So their experience was, help me, help me.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm like, oh man, I hope somebody helps that guy.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Or alternatively, help me, help me.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
What did they do to deserve this?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Can I ask what you all would do in that seat though?

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
Because I imagine my thought process would be this would probably be a pretty uncomfortable social engagement for myself.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
So I'm going to hope that someone else comes or the husky boy dies inside the bathroom.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Because here would be my fear.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I would engage and then realize there was nothing I could do to help.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
And then have to hit that point of, well, I'm going to go back to my seat.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
No, no, no, no.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
One of my favorite ways to help strangers is when the job is to get an adult.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
That's fantastic.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I can get an adult every time you look for someone in like a hat with something on it, usually.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
A clipboard preferably.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
A clipboard, a name tag, and then that adult takes over.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Go grab, pull on the collar of CGI Tom Hanks and get him to.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
So that was my harrowing journey here to Boston.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
But I'm so happy to be here with you now.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
This is an advice show.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Here's advice.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Here's advice number one.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
If someone needs train based bathroom help, be the change you want to see in the world.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Thank you.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Listen, there are so many problems every day we can't do anything about.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But one husky boy trapped in a bathroom.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
You can beat Superman.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I can say I'm a husky boy.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Don't take liberties.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I just did it for shorthand, Justin.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
This is an advice show.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Still, and we're going to help people.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
We won't.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
You all send us some questions and I'm going to read the first of those questions now and then we will turn that question alchemy like into wisdom.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Here we go.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Fruit is my favorite food.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Already.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
That's a bad start.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Fruit can't be your favorite.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
That's like building is my favorite rectangle.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
What do you mean?

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
There's literally a saying about comparing one fruit to another fruit.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah, that is so different.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Fruit is my favorite food.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
Yesterday I brought an entire watermelon with me to a theater rehearsal along with a knife so I could slice it up to eat.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Good so far.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I brought a knife to my job.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Now imagine you're at a rehearsal and you see someone doing that and think about what you would assume.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Then this question continues.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
My castmates all assumed I had brought it to share.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Brothers, is there any acceptable way to explain that the whole watermelon is for me?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
From Melon Collie in Massachusetts.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
All right.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Hold on. Wait.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
It's a very good name.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Very good name. Are you here?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Okay, now here's.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Do you have a knife now?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Or a melon?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
No.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
So here's the thing.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
There was a point where someone said, oh, you brought a watermelon to share or some variation of that.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
And what you could have said was, yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
But you decided in that moment or maybe didn't and you just said there's no going back.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
No, no, this is a personal watermelon.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It's a personal pan watermelon.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
There's nothing stopping you from sharing it from that point forward.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
You're not written all over it like just mine.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Except maybe you'd plant your whole day around enjoying this beautiful juicy boy.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
And he didn't feel like sharing.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Did you wait? Did you break down and share?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
You did.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Wait, hold on.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
After you said it's not for sharing and then broke down because lose lose.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, that's the worst of both worlds.

11:27.000 --> 11:35.000
I think if you have a snack that requires a knife, people are going to think you're going to share it.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
If your snack requires a knife, then it's for sharing.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
You might be right now.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
If your snack requires a knife.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Can you get real quick?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Can you break me off a single other knife based snack?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Peanut butter crackers.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
No, no, it's like it's like cheese block.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Cheese block. Yeah, yeah.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Are you sharing cheese?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
No, I'm not.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Fruit. We covered that.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Loaf of bread.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
You bring a loaf and a knife sharing.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Bring two slices.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
That's your snack.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
An odd snack, perhaps, but a snack it may be.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Did you think about afterwards like I should have cut this at home?

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Probably. I'm going to say probably. That probably crossed their mind.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
If you had a big Ziploc bag of wedges, you definitely would not be getting hassled for that.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
No, here's what you do. A bunch of individual Ziploc bags of one wedge.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
With your name on every bag.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
You eat the wedge and then you bite another one like, didn't they already?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
They definitely already had one.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
This is my first watermelon course and then my second watermelon course.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
What I've done is I've created myself a feast of watermelon nine ways.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Fruit's your favorite food?

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
There's a lot of wicked, good, not fruit-based food out there.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Also, it's your favorite food group and that's an answer.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
But if I said what's your favorite food and you said fruit, I'd be like, you've got to narrow that down.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
But wait, I say my favorite food is cereal.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah, that's...

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
But that's a variation because I could say my favorite food is steak and you could cook a steak different ways or put different toppings on top of it.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
That's like my wife says her favorite food's soup, but she doesn't say her favorite food is liquid.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
That's what I'm saying. Thank you.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Okay.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
What's your favorite food? Beverage.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
They do sell personal watermelons. I know I've seen them at the Kroger.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
The Cha Cha Fancy Kroger, not the Bag Kroger on First Street. The Good Kroger.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
And they have watermelons there that are just personal. They're called personal watermelons.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
That's very helpful. Thank you, Justin.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I'm just saying if you want to...

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
So if you find yourself in Huntington, that's where to find the small watermelons.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Don't go to the Bad Kroger on First Street or the Fifth Avenue Kroger, but I shouldn't need to tell you that.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
Can I say I actually envy it a little bit because my wife and I were talking about this the other day.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
My wife? My wife. When we buy a watermelon because our kids say they like watermelon and they like it to a point.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And unfortunately that point is not finished.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
Right? And so it's like, oh, I do want some watermelon and the rest is for the gods.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
And I know we have a policy of not giving each other parenting advice,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
but I think it's kind of messed up that you do make them eat the rind and everything.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Now, Griffin, it's so funny that you should say make them.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
Well, I would say actively have to work to stop them from eating the rind as they go, I don't like this part.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Um, um, um, um.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
And we say, no one's making you.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
I got in this bad, somehow the TikTok algorithm got fucked up for me.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
And I'm getting tons of videos about how to make jellies out of food scraps.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
And it's like, use the watermelon rind and you can make a jelly out of this.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And it's always some charming woman with a Southern accent.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
She's like, anyway, you got a bunch of corn cobs.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Don't throw those corn cobs away.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
It's like, can I please throw the corn cobs away?

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't, I, now I have every time I eat corn, I am now going to be burdened with a half second of like, should I?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Hold on.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
This is perfectly good jelly I'm basically tossing.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm throwing away jelly ingredients.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Between Facebook videos and TikTok, my aspirations have reached that point of like,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
listen, I'd love to be the kind of person who did something with corn cobs.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
I used to have dreams and that's what I started to give it.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
They should have a service where someone comes and picks up your corn cobs and makes jelly out of them for you.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Ethical sort of corn cobs.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah, ethical, corn based.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Farm to table and then back to farm.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
They drive an ethanol fueled car and they just, okay.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
The office I work at is pretty small and laid back.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
So my coworkers will occasionally bring their dogs or cats in for the day.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It's a great way to brighten up an otherwise tedious workday.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I obviously want to get in on the fun.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
And while I don't have a dog or cat, I do have a four foot long ball python.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Wait, he is very polite.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
It says right there.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Excuse me.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Excuse me.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
What? Oh yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
If I may.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
If I may, your mouse looks delicious.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Is anyone going to eat this mouse?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
No, I don't want to slither on any toes.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
What are your thoughts on snakes in the workplace?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Should I do this?

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Also, what's the best way to sneak a reptile onto public transit?

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
That's from the snake whisperer in South Boston.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Are you here?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
What?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Are there six of you?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
A lot of snake people in the workplace.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Okay, listen, two things about the second part of that question.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Do not sneak a snake onto a bus.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I would much rather see a human being carrying it above their head

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
than suddenly look over and be like, well, there's a snake I wasn't expecting to see there.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Also, I've ridden public transit a lot.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
They won't stop you from bringing a snake on a bus.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
No way. Especially not if you put a little hat on him.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh, that was also my answer for the office part.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Put a little hat on him.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
No matter how upset you got.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh, what a gentleman.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Put this little hat.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Oh, hello little snake Lincoln.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
In fact, a monocle would take it one step up.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
That's ridiculous.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
You're right. You know I said it and I felt it? Too far.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
You're going to have to glue it on and that's immoral.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Well, they would shed the skin that the hat is glued to so it's all okay in the end.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
So that's kind of like temporary.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
And you can also do a little elastic strap around the bottom and he's going to love that.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
It's going to come off in the first bath you give him though.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Well, you're not giving him a bath at work, Justin. Don't be silly.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
That's right. That's true. That's a good point.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I don't mind if you bring a snake.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Sure. Huh.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
That wasn't what I thought your answer would be.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
In the workplace?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
I'd rather you bring a snake.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Well, you don't know what the job is to be fair.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
I'm saying if I brought a snake on stage, since this is our workplace.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
That's very generous. Thank you.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I don't fuck with snakes. It's fine.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Do you think that that was a weird conversation, Jake the snake?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I had to have a lot of like, and you guys are okay.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Is everybody okay with this?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Is everybody fine if I bring a snake in? Because it's kind of my thing.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
But if not, I get it.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I will say this. I'll be Jake the Rake tonight.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I will say this.

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
If you bring a snake with a hat on the screen.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Why does he look like he belongs in a Wes Anderson film?

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
I believe you mean Wes Anderson.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
That's what Paul is doing instead of refilling my drink.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Paul.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
If you bring a dog in the workplace and someone's like, how's it go?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
And you're like, it didn't go great.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
That means that the dog peed on the carpet.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
If you bring a snake into the workplace and someone says, how did it go?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And you said, not great. It ate the dog.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah, is what happened on that one.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
It did strangle Jon Voight a little bit.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
No big deal.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I think the snake's fine. I'm not bothered by snakes.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Can I tell you what's messing me up, Justin?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
What's up? Don't bring a mouse?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I know what animal one could bring that would mess you up.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And I know what animal one could bring that would mess me up.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
I got no idea.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I'm sorry. I have no fear.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Hey, Griffin?

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Hey, Griffin? That's patently untrue.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
What animal, if you walked on stage, right?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
If there's a spider of any size, a mouse.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
There's a mouse rat, like, rodent.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
I've seen Justin, big, small, whatever.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
It doesn't matter. It's off.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I'll give each one of them a sweet little kiss.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
So what's the thing that you came out?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I'm not going to tell you.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
And I'm certainly not going to tell...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
No, you know too much about Justin and I.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
It's too much. The imbalance is palpable.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yes!

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
The snake is the natural enemy of the mouse.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
I don't like mice.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
And the spider, I'm pretty sure.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
What?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And Jon Voight. I'm terrified of that, dude.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I knew it!

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
So if you came out and there was a Jon Voight on the table...

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I shit my pants.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
I live at the corner of a very busy intersection.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And there's a bus stop directly in front of my steps.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Snake people, keep getting off of it in droves.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Wait, hold on. People with snakes or snake people?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Is there a difference?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I'm just kidding, snake people. Go for it.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Chase your dream.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Which one?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Yes!

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I live at the corner of a very busy intersection.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
And there's a bus stop directly in front of my steps.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Whenever I order food, I ask the delivery person to leave it on the porch.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
When I come out to get the food, there are usually several people facing me as I walk out.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
What?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
So they're just standing at the bus stop.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I assume the street is away from your house.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
But they're all turned.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
You're getting hung up on geography.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
You need a diagram.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
They're chanting my name in harmony for saying...

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Omom Shabbat.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Ok, ok.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
The other day, an old man saw me do this and said...

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
What do you got there?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Pizza?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Nice.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
What do you got there?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Pizza?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Nice.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
May I take a run on that?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
What do you got there?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Pizza.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Nice.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Real nice.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Should I... Sorry, Noid.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Better luck next time.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
I saw right through your old man disguise, Noid.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Wait, your face isn't coming off, Noid.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Oh God, it did come off.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Should I pretend I don't notice the people standing less than ten feet away?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Or would that make it worse?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
That's from the food goblin of Waltham, Massachusetts.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Are you here?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Wait, are you here?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Yup.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
I just realized that someone who asked this question probably doesn't want the eyes of thousands of strangers suddenly...

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
What are you watching? My brother and me? Nice.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Nice.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
You could do what I imagine or I've been told or I've seen in videos that like actual celebrities do...

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
When there's like paparazzi and people outside their house on like Hollywood tours and they come out to get their paper.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
You come out and you get your pizza or whatever and you just go like...

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm just like you.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Hi, it's me. The guy you wanted food to hear.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I got Duncan too. Just like everybody else.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Just like you.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
You could do what my son Henry does whenever somebody asks him a question he doesn't want to answer.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Which is that you do your best Shrek voice.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
And you say, get off my swamp!

23:16.000 --> 23:25.000
So, Griffin FaceTimed with Rachel before the show and we were talking about going to the aquarium today.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
And Henry started telling Rachel about seeing the Shreks at the aquarium.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
And then Rachel asked like, did they do tricks? And Henry said, no, they just slapped each other.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
They just slapped each other was his answer.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Which is like, yeah, that's what a bunch of Shreks at an aquarium would do.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
They would probably just slap each other quite a bit while shouting, get out my swamp.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Hey, I'm just going to say, I really think that, and I know we spent a lot of money to build it.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
This Shrek enclosure was a mistake.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Shreks should be in the water.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Let Shreks run free.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
This is what I'm saying.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Were there really Shreks at the aquarium?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Yeah, you missed them.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
There was penguins in one section and then Shreks in another, but they had to keep the donkeys really far away.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Okay.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Do you know what kind of donut Shrek loves?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
What kind, Travis?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Donkeys.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
It's fucking nothing, dude.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
This is my favorite part of our podcast, which is where I make Travis tell three more Shrek jokes.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
He took off the crown, which is an acknowledgement.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
This part's not for you.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
It's for me.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
You know what the most awkward part of being an ogre parent is?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
What's that, Travis?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Having the Shreks talk.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Thank you.

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
Y'all are going to freak the fuck out when you see how fast my cool brother Travis thinks of two more good Shrek jokes.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
You're going to be like-

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Wait, hold on. Hold on to your asses.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Hey, did you hear why the Shrek got overwhelmed by bills?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Why, Travis?

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
They were swamped!

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I'm going to say you need two more Shrek jokes.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Fuck, that was one!

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
No, one and a half.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Okay, I'll do one and a half. I'll give you that.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Tell half of one more Shrek joke.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
And this one can just be a setup and you don't have to do the punchline.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Everyone get right here.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
All right, all right, all right.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Because they were stalking them.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Oh, yeah. What was it?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
I don't know, but I don't like it.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
I know.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
Do you know why Shreks love onions?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Why, Travis?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
They appeal to them.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Fucking hell, man.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
You didn't say they had to be good jokes.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
That air horn was ill.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yeah, it was sick.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
It was a sick and broken air horn.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
It's a living.

25:51.000 --> 26:00.000
I don't want to be ageist up here, but you'll notice that once you get old, you'll just say whatever.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
It's all I want, Justin.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Whatever hoes into your brain at that moment, you'll just say.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Especially if you get a bunch of old people together.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Four.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Four specifically.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Four old people together get so rowdy.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
I was waiting for the elevator at the hotel to go back.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I had just gotten a breakfast to enjoy by myself without my children.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Very much looking forward to it, honestly.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
Just a donut you won't have to bite a bite off of to get it.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
I bought this for me.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm waiting there, and a sweaty guy runs up to me, and it's like, fine.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
We all get it, pal.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Okay, you're exercising.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Wait, you're not going to give context.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
He probably was working out.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
It's exercise.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
We're not in an I'm on the run from the government kind of sweaty, right?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
I don't know that.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
I just wait.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
You don't.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
You don't have that.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Travis, I love you.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Just please let me tell this not very good story.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
So the sweaty guy runs up to me.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
No problem.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
Then four old people just roll up in like a wolf pack, like an old person wolf pack,

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
and they're like, walk up to this dude, and they're standing there at the elevator.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
They managed to wait all of five seconds, restrained themselves before the lady who

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
I think was their leader looks at this guy, and it's like somebody's been exercising.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
Can you give this guy anything?

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
Give him something to respond to that is some sort of prompt that requires a response.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Then immediately the terror starts to seep into my heart.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
I've just got a big bag of waffles and eggs.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
The last thing I need is these old people interrogating me.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
Oh, looks like somebody's eating good or the classic.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Hope you got enough to share.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Oh, God.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Because then you're like, I don't, but should I say that?

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
I don't, but should I be like, I have an English muffin I'm probably not going to need.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Do you guys like loose pads of butter?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I don't know what it is.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
They feel so empowered when you get four older people together.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
It's fantastic.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Good for them.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
They've earned that.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Good for them.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Today I was at the Old North Church.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
I sat down with my daughter for one second, and I heard behind me, purple, huh?

28:05.000 --> 28:11.000
And I looked, and there was just an old man with a very big camera in his hands.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
And then he proceeded to say nothing else.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Excellent.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Excellent.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
So all he gave me was purple, huh?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
A color and a sound.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
You get to an age where you feel like talking, but don't feel like listening.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Yeah.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
And these are the things that you say.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
I want to say something right now, but I don't want to hear what the person says back to me.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
One day I will be old enough to think, I just want to say something that haunts someone for months.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah, I want someone to talk about this on a podcast.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
I'm a shorebird monitor on Martha's Vineyard.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
A what?

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
A shorebird monitor, brag, on Martha's Vineyard.

28:49.000 --> 28:56.000
So my job requires me to interact with a lot of beach nesting birds who are very much not chill with me.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Yeah.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
Some particularly aggressive birds will even dive bomb my head with their razor sharp beaks, and it's pretty intimidating.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
How do I communicate to the birds that I'm a cool person who doesn't want to eat their babies,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
and that I'm here to protect them?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
That's what you would say.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
That's from Bird Brain in Oak Bluffs.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Are you here?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
All right, all right.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
And you definitely won't eat their babies, you promise.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Thank you on behalf of all the birds.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Hold on, can you promise you're not going to?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Before we can address this, we need a solemn vow.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
You are not going to eat any shorebird babies.

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
If there's like a.0001% chance you might eat their babies, you have to say so.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
Just scream at the top of your lungs, I promise not to eat the babies.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
That wasn't what he said.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
That's not what I said.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
My pinky is down here, it's meaningless.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
It's too late now.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
I'm going to tell the birds.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
The birds are wise to dislike you, you're a human.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Yeah.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
I bet pretty much all animals but dogs agree we're the worst.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Of the animals there are, right?

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Humans are the worst, the worst ones.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
And I guarantee there's even some dogs that are like, I think they're okay.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
I think they're all right, but they don't say it to other animals.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Hey, I'm not getting down with this bit, man.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
I'm proud to be a human.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
You are?

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Because I drink Coca-Cola with my mouth.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Got opposable thumbs to play Xbox.

30:33.000 --> 30:42.000
And I drive my bike down south and I proudly stand up next to you, my human friends and kids.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
I said I'm proud to be a human.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
God bless the USA.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Okay, that's good.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
You know what?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Actually, Griffin's changed my mind.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Okay.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
No.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I made a lot of good points.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
A lot of solid points there.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
You need to walk under these birds, look them right in the eye and say, I'm the alpha now.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Yeah.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
1v1 me and Halo, oh wait, you can't.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
You're a bird.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
No, Justin, I don't want to hear it.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
You're going to make these birds look like dumb shits.

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
You're flustered over there because you know I kicked ass with my good song.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
And I know which side of the bread I'm buttered on.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
One bird could say to another, I don't know, Sheila's not that bad.

31:32.000 --> 31:40.000
And then the second bird says, you realize that her species made the ones of us couldn't fly, fuck more to make nuggets easier.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
You know that's the kind of species we're talking about, right?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And she was like, that's actually a pretty good point.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Okay, counterpoint.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Okay.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Turns out that human knows where to buy sunflower seeds.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
They can just get them.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Hey, get these guys all the time.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Even like, I was like, I don't even think there's a sunflower over there.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
But then boom, they rode on and you know what?

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
They were barbecue flavored and it was fucked up.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
I don't know what teriyaki is, but they are on to something.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
It fucking ruled, dude.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Hey, you guys ever heard of bread?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
This earth has got it.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
They're great.

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
Yeah, so we turned some of you into nuggets, but also teriyaki flavor.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
That's all humans.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
They turn our babies into breakfast, but also sun chips.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Hi everybody.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Hey, it's us on stage live.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Well, not live.

32:40.000 --> 32:47.000
No, the house is empty and we're recording an ad read and I'm now feeling the weirdest energy I've ever felt.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
We're here to tell this very haunted casino about stamps.com.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
When you need to mail something and you're going to go to the post office and you think, I can't.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
I can't.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Not today.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Not today.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Certainly.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
I've gone the last 15 days in a row.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
If I go again, they're going to think I'm weird.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
You can head to stamps.com instead where you can save time, save money.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
You got all the access to the post office and UPS shipping services right from your personal computer.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
And you get discounts you can't find anywhere else like up to 30% off USPS rates.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
And get this, you're going to plots 86% off UPS.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
That's the sound I make when I plot.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Yeah, Griffin just plots everywhere.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
Stop wasting time and start saving money when you use stamps.com to mail and ship.

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
Sign up with promo code mybrother for a special offer that includes a four-week trial plus free postage and a digital scale.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I've never done this in an auditorium before.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
I feel like I am defecating on this stage in front of strangers.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
It's so strange.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
No long-term commitments or contracts.

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
Just go to stamps.com, click the microphone at the top of the page and enter code mybrother.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
Hey, I can't believe it's taking me this long to use this intro for this company.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
But do you want your fancy to take flight?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Oh, okay.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Right? It's right there.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Because Stitch Fix will help you get your whole look in order.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
I mean, they mostly hook me up with the board shorts that I crave, which is not especially.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Well, now.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
I mean, Stitch Fix, they provide high-quality clothing that matches your style, budget and size.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
But also, if you need clothes to just be sort of a nasty skater boy.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Just to scuzz around in.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
But then they can do that for you as well.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
I think that they read my mind actually because for a while they were sending me like,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
oh, here's like a blazer and we're going to give trousers.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
No, no.

34:34.000 --> 34:40.000
And then it's suddenly been like, hey, do you want some like hyper-color shorts that could be trunks or shorts?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
We get it, man.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Here you go.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Wear those.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
They're going to send you five pieces of clothing.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
You're going to check them out, try them on and you keep whatever you like.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
What you don't like, you send straight back to them.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000

Hello, I'm a stuffy Dowager Countess.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Travis?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I'm judging everybody's manners.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Oh, no.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Trainers isn't judgy.

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
It's about teaching you to be your best self and be a little more confident when you enter social situations that you don't understand.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
And maybe also teach you a little bit about history you didn't know or give you interesting things to talk about at parties.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Yeah.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Like the secret life of Emily Post.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
Or like why wristwatches are the way that they are.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
We can talk about table manners from the Victorian era.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Sure.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Or what it's like to attend a Regency ball.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah.

35:45.000 --> 35:53.000
You can find all that and more if you listen to shmanners on Maximum Fun or wherever your podcasts come from, I guess.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Manner shmanners.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Get it?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
A man was walking along a beach which represented his life.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
At his feet were two sets of footprints, his and God's.

36:07.000 --> 36:13.000
But looking back down the beach, the man could see that in the hardest parts of his life, there was only one set of footprints.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
So the man said to God, why is there only one set of footprints when times were hard?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Where were you?

36:20.000 --> 36:28.000
And God replied, my precious child, I was in my car listening to the Beef and Dairy Network podcast.

36:28.000 --> 36:41.000
The Beef and Dairy Network podcast is a multi-award winning comedy podcast and you can find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Alert! Alert!

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
There's a haunted doll watch! Alert! Alert!

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Should we go?

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
No, we're safe here, I think.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
Let's me, don't do the picture yet, Paul.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Save the picture.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I just want to tell you all a little bit about today's subject.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
There's a sort of preamble to the description.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Thanks for visiting us.

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
We'd like to make you aware that we put 10 days shipping so we can perform a goodbye session with each vessel.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
A what?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Positive or negative to let them know where they're going.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Wait, a negative?

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
There's a negative?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Get the fuck out!

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
Sorry, Samantha, but his profile makes him seem like a real stinker.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
It's about to get real bad for you out there.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
We mark items as shipped while doing this.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
Some spirits take longer than others to say goodbye.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
This is a person that does not like going to the post office.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
Okay, so let's talk about Rav.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Rav.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Wow.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Wow.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Wow.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
That ain't it.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Rav is-

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
No!

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Can we get an enhance on Rav?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
We don't need an enhance on Rav.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
No!

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Hey, let's see.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
I'm going to say fourth word in the Rav title was unnecessary from that picture.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Okay, Rav is-

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
Did you guys see the production stills from the new Barbie movie?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Yeah.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I found them challenging.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
We're challenging to say the least.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
This is Rav.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
Rav, if you're listening later, is what looks to me like a naked boy Bratz doll with tiny feet.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Footless.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
No feet.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Okay.

38:36.000 --> 38:43.000
Rav's a sexual demonic spirit that is wanting to find someone who is highly charged like him.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Oh, God!

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Rav likes to be your one and only.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Oh, boy.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
If he could, he would show you off to the world.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
He will fall in love with you.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
Rav will protect you with all he has.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
He won't let anyone hurt you.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
Rav likes to lay in bed with you and-

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Nope.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
And watch films.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
And you watch films with Rav.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
What kind of films?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
You will-

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
Well, it doesn't matter, Trev, because you will feel him place his hands on you in a sexual manner.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Obviously!

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
He's certainly not going to place his feet on you.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
Oh, Rav.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Tell-

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
Did fucking Sid from Toy Story make Rav?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Tell him what you want to do.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
Guide him to your weak spots and he will remember what you like.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
She does!

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Right!

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Ah!

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
He's back there, too!

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
Rav shows himself as a heavy-built man with strong arms and muscles.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
His skin glistens with sweat.

39:44.000 --> 39:49.000
Now, they're just describing the doll at this point.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Oh, boy.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Sorry.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Yes, that's a very good sign.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
I'm more interested in the tablecloth, which-

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Do we have a close-up on what's going on?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
We'll work on that.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Bottom right corner, especially.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
Bottom right corner looks like the cover of a babysitter's club book.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
I think it's a Ouija board.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
It is, but it's like two-

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
It almost looks like two parents like,

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
This is fun.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Okay, so they-

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
The way you will see him will be in visions, dreams, nightmares, and meditation state.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
I once meditated so hard, my doll tried to have sex with me.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
It's a normal thing.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Yeah.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Oh, you're yelling.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
That would put David Lynch off of meditation.

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
He will also manifest around the helm, but only you will see and feel him.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
I was hoping he would do some chores as long as he was there.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Big strong man like that.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
He isn't keen on sharing.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Stop it, Paul.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
It's a close zoom there, Paul.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
He isn't keen on sharing.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Tell me your weaknesses.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Tell me your weaknesses, I'll remember what you like.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
He would rather have you all to himself.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Yeah, I know that about him.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Stop it, Paul.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
A feeling of not being alone is common with Raul.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Paul, go to jail.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
Oh wait, right there in the doll's eye, it's the moment of Paul's death.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Whoa, I can see it.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
It's going to be soon if he keeps this up.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
A feeling of not being alone is common with Rav.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
He likes you to know where he is, there with you, no matter what you are doing.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
Communication with Rav has been Ouija board, spirit dance, spirit box.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
Man, if you come over and you see your aunt spirit dancing to communicate with her sexy doll, that's pretty much it.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
You know you're in for the weirdest summer of your life.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
Hey, that new Neil Simon play is real strange.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
Spirit dance, spirit box, manifestation, loud bangs.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
Thank you, Rav.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Don't mind if I do.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Ooh la la.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Ooh la la.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
And scratching around the home.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
Alright, Rav and a gerbil have that in common. Excellent.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Hey, what's that? Is that a squirrel on your walls?

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
These spirits will need time to see you and know what you're about.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Please be patient with him.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
When he arrives, light the candle, welcome him into your home.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
This is a bonding process.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
We have excellent feedback.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
On Rav?

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
This is our 15th Rav.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.000
And I think I speak for everyone here when I say we really nailed it this time.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
This one's even Ravier than the last.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
So that's Rav.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
Rav is available for 23 sterling.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Listen, I know it's too late now, but don't buy Rav.

42:42.000 --> 42:50.000
Rav costs 23 pounds and it costs 56 pounds to ship his incredible huge muscular body.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Don't buy Rav.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
No, they're gonna buy Rav.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Someone already buys Rav.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Somebody already buys Rav.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
Someone always buys Rav, so that is our Haunted Doll Watch for this week.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Thank you. Keep your eyes peeled for Rav.

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
Okay, we have asked you all to send in your questions to be addressed live.

43:12.000 --> 43:21.000
Please understand that what we can see right now is like a shadow meeting us in a parking garage to give us government secrets.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
And so please understand that's the dynamic we have with you.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I understand.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Hello. Oh no.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Are you Brendan?

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
I am Brendan, yes.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Hi, Brendan.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
Okay, I want to start by saying my mother-in-law is a wonderful person.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
She's like a kickass.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
This is such a good start, Brendan.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
No, no. She's like this old-school kickass feminist.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
She rules, okay?

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
But...

43:44.000 --> 43:50.000
But whenever she texts, she likes to use a lot of abbreviations.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
And she will save every character she can.

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
She... She spells the word come, C-U-M.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
No.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
Because that could be the correct spelling based on what she's talking about.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Yes, context is, oh my God, the most important.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I have some examples.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Sure.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Yes.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Like just some texts we've gotten from over the years.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
What time should we come?

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Uh-huh.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
And can we just say sting like control at that point?

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Yeah.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
And the answer is always 8-0-2.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Should we bring snacks when we come?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I mean, it's polite.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
It is a nice thing to do.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
Not sure... Not sure if your father will come.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
It's nice to have an honest understanding of Warren Jones' ability.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Open sexual conversations with your mother-in-law.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
It's progressive.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
Listen, sometimes I'm phoning it in.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
So how do I make her stop?

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
How do you make her keep going forever and ever and ever?

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Forever and ever and ever?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Hey, Brennan.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
Brennan, I'm going to ask you an honest question and I want an honest answer.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Yeah, sure.

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
Has there ever been a text message where you were confused about the actual intention of it?

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
Or did you always know what she meant?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I hope I always knew what she meant.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Then you don't have to fix it.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah, this is...

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
It's a great thing for you to enjoy.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
That is both clear communication and something you can share with friends.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
No, no, no.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Hold on.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Here comes the fun police over here.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
No, it's not the fun police.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
It's just Brennan is probably not the only human this person has texted.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Oh, shit.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
They're texting, like, the pool guy.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
It's like, hey, I'm coming in the pool right now.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Hold on.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Wait, what?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
When will you come, pool man?

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
Will you come in my house?

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
I mean, there's a lot of opportunities here.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Can I just say...

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Hey, are you going to come all over the place?

45:55.000 --> 46:09.000
Can I just say that as a sexual proposition, when will you come is a really confusing one of them.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
What's the rush?

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Relax.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Don't do it.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Brennan.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Yes, sir.

46:18.000 --> 46:29.000
Is the relationship you have with his mother-in-law such that if you said, hey, you know that the spelling of that means something else, would she laugh or would she be so embarrassed you could never see her again?

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I think she'd be very confused.

46:31.000 --> 46:38.000
But allegedly, her son, my brother-in-law, has raised this with her before, but to no effect.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Okay, not your job.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
You're fine.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
You're fine then.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Congratulations, Brennan.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I just elevated this to not your problem.

46:45.000 --> 47:02.000
Can I just, though, let me devil's advocate this for your mother-in-law, and I guess everybody else's mother-in-law, that spelled the correct way still means the thing, so...

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Less obviously, though.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Yeah, I guess that's right.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
No, but also, we just talked earlier about how we can't wait to get old so we can say things that people talk about forever.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
I could see me being a father and mom, like, they think I don't know.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
I'm cool.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
I live in the 60s.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Does that help, Brennan?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Oh, sure, yeah.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it, but thank you for being here.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Yeah, man.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Thank you.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Thank you so much.

47:24.000 --> 47:29.000
Thank you, Jupiter, for sanitizing the microphone.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
That's incredible work.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Jupiter!

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Jupiter, everybody.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Jupiter's on our team.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Jupiter rules.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Hello.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Hi.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
A lot of places can't afford a full-time microphone sanitizer, but that's the kind of show we do.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Hi.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Hi, I'm Shayla.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
My pronouns are she, hers.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Hello.

47:49.000 --> 47:55.000
And my question is, tomorrow is Father's Day, and I haven't gotten my dad a Father's Day gift.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
You are all dads.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
What should I get him?

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
I am currently wearing my Father's Day present from my family.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
It's these incredible jeans.

48:06.000 --> 48:16.000
I was in another room, and I heard my wife talking to my children about what we should get daddy for Father's Day.

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
And my daughter, Baby, said, I know, she's five, a nesting doll.

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
And at first I was like, what?

48:27.000 --> 48:34.000
And then she said, get this, because my daughters are genius, the biggest doll looks like daddy, the inside doll looks like mommy,

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
a smaller doll looks like me, and the smallest doll looks like dot.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Right?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
And I was like, holy shit, dude.

48:42.000 --> 48:50.000
I know it's a little cliche, but kids really do say the darnedest things.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
Because I think me and my wife are totally ready to dunk on her.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Yeah.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
We were so ready to be like, you dumb piece of shit.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Travis.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I know.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Announcement.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
I know the perfect gift for every dad.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
A grill.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
No.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Nope.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Here it is.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
You ready?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Yeah.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Yeah.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
A stud finder.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Now, why is that the perfect gift for every dad?

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
One, you lose the damn things all the time.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
God, yes.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
You have to go searching for it.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
It's annoying.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
You can have a stud on every floor of your house.

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
Two, it gives your dad the opportunity to take it out of the package, put it on himself, and say it's working.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Which is shit, dad.

49:33.000 --> 49:45.000
And let me tell you, in the operating room, when Henry was born, the nerves I felt, it's indescribable.

49:45.000 --> 49:53.000
Literally, you feel your life change when you hear the sound of your baby making the first sounds for the first time.

49:53.000 --> 50:00.000
And also, this thing happens in your brain where you're like, a stud finder joke would be pretty fucking funny right now.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Yeah, right?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
I can't explain it.

50:02.000 --> 50:09.000
A thing clicked over in my brain where it was like, think of all the things you could fit a cow joke into.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
It's so much.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
It's constant.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
It's like, moo fits into so much.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
It sounds like so many great words.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Um, cash.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Yeah.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
I think I already crushed it.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
I feel like stud finder.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
We're all kind of agreed on a stud finder.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
I think a stud finder is really cool.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
Hey, listen.

50:31.000 --> 50:40.000
My friends who are a bit younger than me who are here, I know most of you are older than me, but for those of you that are younger than me, get yourself a stud finder if you don't have one yet.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Oh my god.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
And have some.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Sure, hang in your pictures like a pro.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
Have some extra nine volts around because you never think about them because they're so weird.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
But when you need one, oh Jesus.

50:50.000 --> 50:56.000
You're thinking drywall anchors will get the job done, but the cavities they leave in the wall are unsightly.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Oh my god.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Does that help?

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Yes, that's perfect.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Thank you.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Do you want to talk more about stud finders and drywall?

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Because they have them now.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.000
They have them now with a metal mode, and I just got this one with a built-in laser measure.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Oh, forget about it.

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
What's nice is that you can find the ones where they can detect wiring in the wall.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
That's a safety hazard.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Oh my god, so important.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Let's keep that dad around.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
I see someone nodding behind you.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Yeah, you don't want to zap that dad.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
Don't let your dad get zapped.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
I saw a TikTok recently, which my kids introduced me to, and someone drilled a hole in the wall,

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
and there was water sheeting out because they went right into a water pipe.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
Yeah, I watched one where a dad drilled into a wall and got zapped and fucking died.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
You could see a skeleton through his body.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
And it was a TikTok stuff film, and it's still up.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
You can watch it if you want to.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
If you Google totally dad fails, you'll find it.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
If you Google, uh-oh.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Come on.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Come on.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Follow through.

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
If you Google Zap Daddies, you'll find it.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
I don't know if that helps you, but I bet it helps a lot of people in the audience.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Thank you so much.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Just going to go to ZapDaddies.com real quick.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Justin, have you ever bought a URL on stage at a show before?

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Hey, don't do it!

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Don't, please don't.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
That would be so rude.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
Go ahead, guys, do your show.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Next, yes, hello.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Hello.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Hello.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
What's your name?

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Max.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Hi, Max.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Hello, Max.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Can you just keep it down a little bit?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Sorry, Justin.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
He's listening.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
We'll scoot over there.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
That's fine, that's fine.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
He does this so much, he can use 10% of his mind to buy a URL.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
You are racing over a thousand.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
I'm on the limitless bill right now.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Max, what is your question?

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
All right, so I have an issue.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It might be an issue, it might not be.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Oh, okay.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
Well, 10 o'clock, 10.30 every night, no matter where I am, no matter what I'm doing,

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
I get really, really tired and start to fall asleep.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
All right?

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Yeah.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
But I fall asleep for like a half an hour.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
I wake up after that half an hour.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
I'm perfect.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
A little disco nap.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
I was living with my parents where this wasn't an issue because they did the exact same thing.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Yeah.

53:23.000 --> 53:29.000
But now I'm a young person in the city and I go to events and parties and hang out with people.

53:29.000 --> 53:35.000
And so now at around 10 o'clock when other young people are not falling asleep,

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
I need to take a little half hour power nap.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Sure.

53:39.000 --> 53:45.000
And it's gotten to the point now where my friends have whole albums on their phone of me just asleep on the couch.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Hey, that fucking sucks, Max.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
No.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Yeah.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
I don't love it.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Hey, Max, can I stop you real quick?

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Yeah, of course.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
How old are you?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
I am 23.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Oh, you are actually a young person.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Okay.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Yeah, no, I'm fairly young.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
I was ready to have a tough conversation where it's like, if you had said like 28 or above,

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
I was like, yeah, no, hey, listen, it's time to brace yourself.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Hey, you heard it here, folks.

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
If you're 28 or above, you have one foot in the fucking grave.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Yeah, dude.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
Yes, Griffin.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
I stand by that.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Okay, Max.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
I'm glad it's coming to that realization in five years, but like I kind of have a little time.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
Yeah, hey, Max, please.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
This wasn't your question.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Enjoy it while you fucking can.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Max.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
Amanda, ZapDaddies.com costs $100.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Count by it on the company card.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
Yay.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
She's giving a big thumbs up, okay.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
So is your question how to serve.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Amanda, it got declined.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
Are we in trouble?

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Everybody buy posters on your way out, okay?

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
As many as you can carry, all right?

54:51.000 --> 54:56.000
Can I just say, actually, if our bank was like this, we're not going to let you do this.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Good on our bank.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
That's a fucking good bank.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
That's a good bank.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Max, sorry.

55:00.000 --> 55:07.000
Yeah, my question is just how do I take a half hour nap without people finding out?

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Sure, sure, sure.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
So here's the good news, Max.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
All right.

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
Most people do not think about you as much as you think they do.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
No, hear me out, hear me out.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
This is a good thing.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
You can disappear for a half hour.

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
That's a good window of time before someone goes, where's Max?

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
As long as if it's like three people hanging out, you say, I'm going to go snooze for 30 minutes.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
So like that's fine.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
But if you're like at a party or a club or something, you just need to find a pile of coats

55:35.000 --> 55:42.000
or some warm, dry hay, right, whatever, and just curl up on and sleep for a half hour, it's fine.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
That's okay.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I was going to suggest coat bed.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Coat bed is amazing.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Yes.

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
The fact that they provide coat bed for any other purpose than having a secret nap in

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
is outrageous to me because nothing's better.

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
What's better than wearing one coat, being in a big pile of other people's coats?

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
Just tell everybody that you're getting really into meditation.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
Is that why you do it?

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
Listen, I can't deal with your stuff right now, okay?

56:13.000 --> 56:18.000
I'm really trying to get ZappedDaddies.com.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Do you live in the city?

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
Listen, we're just a small community of daddies that love the movie Zapped.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
Okay.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
What was your answer to that?

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
I do live in Boston.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Okay.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
So I don't, I mean, do you have a car?

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
I have a car, yeah.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
How do you know?

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
It was my grandmother's if that, not as fancy.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
But I mean, is it, does it have enough room for you to go sleep in it?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
It's a super outback.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
It's got a lot of room.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Oh, hell yeah.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Oh yeah.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
I love a super outback.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
My wife drives an outback.

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
Max, there's so many places to sleep in this big, beautiful world of ours.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
And only a few of them are going to get you in trouble.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
I just, I want to stop my friends from taking pictures of me while I'm taking my snooze.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Yeah, Max.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Hey, listen.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
Hey, now we're going to move beyond the problem you asked about and the problem you need us

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
to answer.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
Yeah.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Do you want to reframe everything?

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I was going to say, I think my question has transformed a little bit.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Yeah, look at this.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
How do I rebuild healthy relationships with the friends around me?

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Yeah.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
My friends are planning my death is the only thing.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Okay.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
I'm getting an error that says there's a problem fulfilling my order.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
If one of y'all bought ZapDaddies.com, respect.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Respect.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
You did it.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Max, does anything we've said help so far?

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
We've given you so much good stuff.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
That's all good, right?

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Yeah.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
I mean, the thing is I already take all my friends' coats when we like go out.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Take their phones.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
So I just, I think I just make a nest in kind of.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Here's what it is today.

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
I'm going to go lay down, put your phones in this bag and you magnet seal it so you're

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
done.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Yes.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Like you're a problematic comedian.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Yeah.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Does that help?

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
That's incredibly helpful.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Thank you.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Fantastic.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Thank you.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Okay.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
One more.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
Who do we have here?

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Looking very fancy behind you.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Look what the cat.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
The mic must be sanitized.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Oh no.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Thank you, Jupiter.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Who the hell are you?

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
Who might you be?

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
What's this all about?

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Hello.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Hello.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Hi.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
I'm Adrian Cowles.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Hi, Adrian Cowles.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Hi.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
How are you?

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
How are you?

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
How are you?

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
How are you?

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
How are you?

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
How are you?

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
How are you?

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
How are you?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
How are you?

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Adrian Cowles.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
What?

58:29.000 --> 58:36.280
I'm going to say Yahoo Enabler.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.520
Adrian Cowles.

58:37.520 --> 58:40.440
And now Wikihow Enabler, Adrian Cowles.

58:40.440 --> 58:47.220
Thank you for your years of hard work, Adrian.

58:47.220 --> 58:53.380
Now it's all come full circle.

58:53.380 --> 58:58.900
You sent in a couple of questions, which usually we frown on, but you're Adrian fucking Cowles,

58:58.900 --> 58:59.900
so...

58:59.900 --> 59:03.180
And also, you only know how to send in a couple of questions.

59:03.180 --> 59:07.100
You also know how to send in 15 questions, so you had one about cards.

59:07.100 --> 59:13.100
Yeah, so is there a statute of limitations on repossessing Yu-Gi-Oh cards from a child?

59:13.100 --> 59:18.580
Now, hold on, the way you just phrased that, Adrian, makes it sound like this kid is defaulted

59:18.580 --> 59:23.620
on a loan, and you need to go to their house and repossess their Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

59:23.620 --> 59:28.460
Adrian, can you get right up on that microphone and tell us exactly why you gave your Yu-Gi-Oh

59:28.460 --> 59:30.860
cards away to a child in the first place?

59:30.860 --> 59:31.860
Uh, panic.

59:31.860 --> 59:32.860
Panic?

59:32.860 --> 59:33.860
So...

59:33.860 --> 59:34.860
Were you held up?

59:34.860 --> 59:36.140
Now, was the kid gonna beat you up?

59:36.140 --> 59:41.340
Well, so my dad had a colleague over, I was probably like, I don't know, 19, whatever,

59:41.340 --> 59:42.340
home from college.

59:42.340 --> 59:45.980
Did you just say the sentence, my dad had a child over?

59:45.980 --> 59:46.980
Colleague.

59:46.980 --> 59:47.980
Colleague, okay.

59:47.980 --> 59:52.860
And they brought their kids who were like 10, and I was entertaining the children, I

59:52.860 --> 59:55.460
don't know, but they were in my room and they were like, what are those?

59:55.460 --> 01:00:00.580
And I had my like gold-sleeved Yu-Gi-Oh deck, and I was like, oh, those are my Yu-Gi-Oh

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.780
cards, and they were like, can I have those?

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:06.380
And I said, okay.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:11.300
I mean, listen, in fairness, I hadn't used them in a couple years, and I hadn't really

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:16.260
thought about this until a child, I'm a teacher, this year was like, oh, Yu-Gi-Oh is really

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.260
cool, huh?

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.980
And I was like, it was.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.500
No, dude, it's back in a big way.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500
Yeah, it is back.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.500
It's weird.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500
Is it still?

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500
Okay.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.860
So how do I get those back?

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:32.320
How old would you guess that child is now?

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.260
Probably like 18, I don't know.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.260
18?

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.260
They don't have those cards.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.580
That's not a child anymore, Adrian.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.800
That's an adult who stole your Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.580
You have a legal case against this adult.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.260
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy, attorney of law.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.060
Did a kid steal your Yu-Gi-Oh cards six years ago?

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:53.140
Through force and intimidation.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:56.500
Did you feel bullied in the moment, Adrian?

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.500
Maybe.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.500
Just saying no is hard, and yeah.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.100
Do I have to find the kid that he gave them to now?

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.100
Is that just the truth?

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:09.780
It's like Toy Story 3 rules, my second Toy Story reference of the evening.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:14.300
Was he wearing like a little propeller hat and suspenders, and he's like, please, please,

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.300
Mr. Cowles.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.300
Please, Mr. Cowles.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.940
I just need these Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:23.300
Can I have your blue-eyes white dragon?

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:30.620
Adrian, there's only one option for you, and I'm sorry to say it because it won't be easy.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:36.140
You're gonna need to buy a basic starter deck of Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and you're gonna need to

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.780
play this kid for all the marbles.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.700
It's time to duel!

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:49.900
And he's gonna have all the choice cards, all the greatest Yu-Gi-Oh cards like Rizzo

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:56.300
and Stone Guy, all the good ones.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:04.100
And you're just gonna have the basic ones like Bulbasaur and Dug, but you're gonna have

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.700
to come out on top playing for all the marbles.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:09.300
High stakes, I know, but I think it's your only play.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.900
And you're gonna need to let the ancient spirit that lives within your brain come out so that

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.420
you can defeat him.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.420
Or let your grandpa's ghost come out of a pyramid.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.460
I've never watched Yu-Gi-Oh, but I think that's what happens.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:26.980
Griffin and I are referencing the same thing from two different perspectives.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.980
Does that help, Adrian?

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.980
Absolutely.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.980
Thank you, Adrian.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.780
You've helped us a great deal.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:37.020
And you all have helped us a great deal just now by being such a wonderful audience.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.340
Thank you so much for being here.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.660
We really very much appreciate you.

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.640
Boston is always uniformly fantastic.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.000
We say this shit to a lot of cities.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.500
We especially mean it for you all.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.960
Boston has, every time we've done a show here, it has been incredible.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.220
Thank you to Jupiter and Rachel and Amanda, all of whom work for us and all of whom are

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.500
fantastic and all of whom are here.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.500
And Paul.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.500
And Paul Saborin, who's a contractor, so it's not the same thing.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.700
And Alice.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.060
Without Alice, Theresa and I wouldn't have been able to do Schwaners.

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.340
Alice watched her kids with Schwaners.

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.660
Thanks to whoever got Zap Daddies for saving me from myself.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.660
I appreciate that.

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:23.060
Thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life Is Better With You.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:26.060
Thank you to Liz Fernandez for my makeup and tiara.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:30.980
Thank you to the Wang Theater for being just the prettiest, the prettiest and best theater.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:31.980
So beautiful.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:32.980
Make sure you look as you're leaving.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.980
It's gorgeous.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:40.820
I was out here during mic check and just pointed over and said, the angels are eating fruit

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.340
in that voice.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.900
Which was, for someone who didn't know what she was referencing, pretty confusing.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:47.900
Yeah.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.860
Griffin, I would love to hear an impression of Mark Wahlberg.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.740
Yeah, sure.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:00.300
Mark Wahlberg pitching his family on the idea of Wahlbergers for the first time.

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.300
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:08.460
What if we did it more Boston?

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.620
My name is Justin Matkgery.

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:14.060
Is he from Boston?

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:15.340
That was not a word.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.340
That was not a word.

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.340
That was not a word.

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.340
I'm...

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.340
Wait, wait.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.340
Hold on, hold on.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.060
How do you like them apples, uh?

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.260
Don't get...

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.260
Don't get...

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.340
My name's Justin Matkgery.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.020
Get out of my swamp.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.020
Get out of my swamp.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.020
I'm Ben Affleck!

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.020
With my brother, my brother, we kiss.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.020
I'm Minnie Driver!

01:04:38.020 --> 01:05:03.020
Square on the lips!

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.020
It's better with you!
