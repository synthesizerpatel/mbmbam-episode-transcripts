WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.480
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:48.480 --> 00:53.520
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Uh, let me check my documents here. I'm your

00:53.520 --> 01:00.640
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. Sup, it's Griffin. What's up, Griffin? We've got another

01:00.640 --> 01:06.480
film watch, uh, one of our great series where we pick a popcorn flick coming out that week and

01:06.480 --> 01:12.640
pretend as though we're very excited for it and that we've seen it or will see it, and this week

01:12.640 --> 01:20.160
our, uh, the funny one we got is They Shall Not Grow Old. You guys ready for some fucking gags?

01:20.160 --> 01:27.040
They Shall Not Grow Old watch. Peter Jackson has taken a bunch of dope ass footage from World War

01:27.040 --> 01:36.000
One and given it that, put Jar Jar in it, cleaned it up, put Jar Jar in it, colorized it, smoothed

01:36.000 --> 01:44.080
it out, sexied it up, crunchitized it. Now Justin photoshopped away all the old man wrinkles,

01:44.080 --> 01:49.120
put a bunch of Instagram filters on it. It's just a bunch of sexy ass Chris Helmsworths walking

01:49.120 --> 01:53.840
around. Now Justin, I of course know everything about this film. I studied it up before I watched

01:53.840 --> 01:58.960
it, but for those at home that may be wondering, is this like, is there like a storyline?

01:58.960 --> 02:04.080
It's like, it's a, it's an homage to British troops in the First World War with a bunch of

02:04.080 --> 02:11.200
footage that he has like remastered, uh, with, uh, overlaid with a narrative of those who partook

02:11.200 --> 02:16.240
in the war from interviews made in the 60s and 70s. What is, what's uncomfortable is they can't,

02:16.240 --> 02:20.640
it's like Super Bowl, they can't actually say World War One, so they call it the Big Fight

02:20.640 --> 02:27.280
throughout the whole movie. The first big fight! Yeah, the huge skirmish. I think that this,

02:27.280 --> 02:33.280
if you have, okay, if you've seen this footage, it is amazing what, uh, Pete has done. He's taken

02:33.280 --> 02:40.160
this like really old grainy footage and made it feel so real, uh, which, uh, is, is extremely

02:40.160 --> 02:46.880
impressive. The reviews are in on this one, and it is, I just, it's an amazing achievement that

02:46.880 --> 02:52.880
Peter Jackson has done, and the critics are all uniformly lining up to hail this outstanding,

02:52.880 --> 02:59.760
amazing achievement, but you know there's still one who's like, I don't know, I don't know.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.440
Where's the superheroes? I've seen some other movies and I've

03:03.440 --> 03:12.320
never before seen World War One footage digitally remastered for modern audiences.

03:12.320 --> 03:19.040
This one left me feeling a little cold. So I guess the thing that's on everybody's tongues is

03:19.040 --> 03:28.000
what's, what else can Peter put his magic touch on and remaster? What, uh, maybe just wars or

03:28.000 --> 03:32.880
maybe there's other stuff? It seems like war he's got pretty much figured out at this point,

03:32.880 --> 03:39.360
so maybe it's cheaper for him to do wars. I, I have some footage of me making a sandwich a

03:39.360 --> 03:45.200
couple years ago, but I, I didn't make it interesting. I forgot to make it interesting,

03:45.200 --> 03:47.360
if I'm being honest. The sandwich or the footage?

03:47.360 --> 03:51.280
I mean both, honestly. I would like Peter Jackson to remaster my sandwich.

03:51.280 --> 03:55.600
I'd like to see him take a pass at the War of the Roses, but not the actual one,

03:55.600 --> 04:03.280
the Kathleen Turner film. Oh, yeah. Punch it up. Punch up that Kathleen Turner Michael Douglas

04:03.280 --> 04:10.320
classic. Punch it. This guy could do anything, right? Pete can take a whole war and make it

04:10.320 --> 04:16.320
feel like one movie. He could take 50,000 orcs and make them feel like one army. What I would

04:16.320 --> 04:23.360
like him to do is dip into the series Supernatural, which has just crested 300 episodes, and I would

04:23.360 --> 04:32.480
love him to just bring it on in. What I want Pete to do, now that he's finished his World War I

04:32.480 --> 04:36.800
film documentary, I want him to just take all 300 episodes of the Supernatural and just fucking

04:37.440 --> 04:42.080
bring it in so I can get caught up on this series, see what all the fuss is about.

04:42.880 --> 04:48.480
Every other issue of Entertainment Weekly has it on the cover. I just want to get in on the hubbub,

04:48.480 --> 04:54.480
the fandom, the tumbling of this show, and I can't because there's 300 episodes and I will be dead

04:54.480 --> 04:59.040
by the time that I watch all those back-to-backs. I just need Pete to bring it in. To bring it on.

04:59.040 --> 05:03.040
J-Man, I'm going to do some quick math here, and let's assume that with commercial breaks,

05:03.040 --> 05:08.640
there's 45 minutes of actual Supernatural in each episode, and you're saying 300,

05:08.640 --> 05:19.840
so that's 13,500 minutes. Wouldn't it be amazing if Michael, if, if, if, who's Michael? If Peter

05:19.840 --> 05:22.240
Jackson could- Who's Michael, though?

05:22.240 --> 05:24.080
I don't know. Where did Michael come from?

05:24.080 --> 05:26.800
I was thinking of Michael Jackson. If Peter Jackson-

05:26.800 --> 05:29.360
That's 225 hours of Supernatural. Right.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.880
So much. So much show.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.920
Or- In one hour.

05:33.920 --> 05:39.920
Nine and a third days of Supernatural. In one hour, he would have to squeeze

05:39.920 --> 05:46.640
225 minutes into each minute of an hour long episode to get you caught up.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.320
Math is fun. I think that- Thank you, Griffin. I agree.

05:50.320 --> 05:57.040
I think that, can you even imagine, he did the whole war, I guess, in one flick,

05:57.040 --> 06:04.880
but The Hobbit, a 300 page long book, did take three flicks. That's kind of a fart in the face

06:04.880 --> 06:07.760
to people who did World War I, huh? I think so.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.120
Well, or something.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.880
If they could come back and watch one of the three Hobbit movies where it's like,

06:12.880 --> 06:18.480
here's a 30 minute section on the kind of grass that hobbits eat or whatever,

06:19.040 --> 06:23.200
and they're like, wow, that's cool. My whole thing got blown up, but I guess that one got-

06:23.200 --> 06:29.120
Cut for time, Pete. I cut my whole place getting blown up for time, I guess.

06:29.120 --> 06:35.680
I think that there is- And I think this one is just coming out for one day at a limited

06:35.680 --> 06:39.440
release situation. An event release, if you will.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.280
What a hot watch we're doing.

06:41.280 --> 06:49.360
Yeah, this is a hot watch. February 1, I think, is the time that you can see this one out.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.000
Cool, man.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.440
Yeah, man, cool. Go see this flick. Let us know. Well, I mean,

06:56.320 --> 06:58.960
let Rotten Tomatoes know what you think, and we'll definitely see it that way.

07:00.560 --> 07:05.520
We are an advice program, right? So we take questions from you, our beloved audience.

07:05.520 --> 07:14.320
You can send those to mbambam at maximumfun.org, and send us your questions. Let us know how we

07:14.320 --> 07:20.800
can help. If you need real, actual advice, not pretend advice, or you just want to tell us a

07:20.800 --> 07:25.760
story or anything like that. If you need actual advice, let us help you. That's our core competency,

07:25.760 --> 07:27.520
really, when all is said and done.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.840
And that's going to do it for us this week.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.600
That's it for our episode. A lot of just sort of talking in this one.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.920
Yeah, but we want to say thank you to-

07:35.920 --> 07:37.680
Hey, wait, let me get a hand on the talking ball.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.560
We never say thank you to the address.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.800
No, listen, I want to talk. I want to talk. I just got a Google calendar notification pop

07:42.800 --> 07:47.680
up that Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out tomorrow. I can't believe it's actually here, folks,

07:47.680 --> 07:50.960
and I heard in this one, Mickey Mouse actually kills Sephiroth.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.800
Why didn't we do a watch on that? Why did we pick the hard one about the war that we

07:56.800 --> 07:59.920
don't know much about and have to really kind of watch what we say?

07:59.920 --> 08:03.600
We could have talked about, it's because you're so very excited for it, huh?

08:03.600 --> 08:05.520
I just can't wait to watch Mickey Mouse fight.

08:05.520 --> 08:10.800
Do you think when they're getting ready to make a new Kingdom Hearts game,

08:10.800 --> 08:17.200
they just do a deep dive on Disney fan fiction and steal a bunch of ideas?

08:17.200 --> 08:20.320
They've stolen a lot of my Wreck-It Ralph fan fiction.

08:21.200 --> 08:26.400
I have one where his fists go to the sides of buildings, and they're so big and sweaty,

08:27.120 --> 08:34.080
he can't do anything with them, and they drag him around, and Elsa and Moana and

08:35.440 --> 08:44.000
Flint Ryder from Tangled have to come help him carry his fists, and his pants get caught.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.320
His super overalls get caught on a rock, and they tear off.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.640
And so they're dragging him by his huge fists, and that is in Kingdom Hearts 3.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.160
I saw it on a trailer, so I'm not going to say it on that.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.760
Yeah, Kingdom Hearts 3 does have Wreck-It Ralph with his huge fists,

08:59.760 --> 09:03.200
and he teams up with Master Chief for an Ultima summon.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.360
And his pants rip off, I guess?

09:05.360 --> 09:06.400
His pants rip off, and his-

09:06.400 --> 09:09.920
But it's not a dress. Listen, it's not a sexual thing.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.600
It's just a funny thing that happens.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.240
And his Jim Jams all pixelated, and Master Chief's like,

09:16.240 --> 09:18.640
what's, oh, I guess they're censoring your Jim Jam.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.720
And Wreck-It Ralph's just like, no, that's what it looks like on a video game.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.480
And Master Chief then just says a quiet prayer.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.240
He's very religious in this one.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.000
There's a lot of praying to Christ.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.360
Yeah, there's a whole Christ narrative in this one.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.640
Yeah, one of the movies that they make a world out of is The Bible.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.360
It's great.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.960
Yeah, the Disney movie The Bible.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.560
And sort of fully gets saved. Let's do some questions.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.560
Finally, Mickey converts.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.560
Master Chief takes off his helmet.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.880
He says, finally, I can reveal my identity as Jack Sparrow.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.240
The whole time it's been Jack Sparrow underneath the helmet.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.080
And then he becomes a Christian, too.

10:02.080 --> 10:07.760
This would have been a way better intro.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.680
It's a shame we didn't do this one.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.680
Jesus Christ.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.440
Then Tron comes out.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.360
He's doing all these crazy stunts.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.840
And when the camera pulls back, he's spelled out with his light cycle.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.200
John 3.16.

10:33.200 --> 10:33.760
Yeah.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.520
Tron loves Jesus, too.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.600
Cyber Jesus, of course.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.480
But all right, all right.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.360
Here comes the question.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.520
At the end of Kingdom Hearts, they all get saved.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.160
Okay, okay.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.920
No, pull it back in.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.200
Pull it back in.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.320
Oh, we were almost there.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.560
We were so close to doing our podcast that we do it every week.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.160
Here comes the podcast you've been waiting for.

11:04.160 --> 11:07.200
Then I pictured Lightning McQueen getting baptized.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.160
We can't, we can't.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.680
It's just a car, but it's a car wash.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.200
We can't, we can't, we can't.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.320
Go, read the first question.

11:12.320 --> 11:12.800
Go, come on.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.080
No, we can't do this.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.520
I can't do it.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.080
No.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.440
We can't do this.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.080
The chicken from Moana says Jesus.

11:20.080 --> 11:20.880
All right, so we're done.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.920
We're done, that's it.

11:21.920 --> 11:22.320
That's it.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.960
He swallows a Bible whole and he gets choked on it.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.760
All right, here comes the first question.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.880
He does go to heaven.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.680
Hey, hey.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.880
Voiced by Alan Tudyk.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.640
For the last year or so, I've been working in the mall as a retail assistant.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.440
Throughout, I don't like the feeling of doing one of these questions.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.480
I don't like reading questions written by-

11:38.480 --> 11:39.840
Come on, nephew, you feel froggy?

11:39.840 --> 11:40.400
Do it, baby.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.360
You started.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.520
It's just reading a question written by a sensible human being is weird to me.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.760
For the last year or so, I've been working in a mall as a retail assistant.

11:49.760 --> 11:54.160
Throughout my time working there, I have gotten to know quite a few of the people who also work

11:54.160 --> 11:54.640
in the mall.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.920
A few weeks ago, a girl who works at the Mexican restaurant-

11:59.200 --> 12:00.320
Justin, come on.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.280
You're sitting down here.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.240
I'm fine.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.160
And the mall came to introduce herself.

12:05.040 --> 12:08.880
She told me her name, and then I should, quote, drop by sometime.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.160
And she will give me some- give me half-priced burritos.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.600
I have now happily done so on several occasions.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.800
I just thought that this is a friendly thing to do, but my co-workers met her before,

12:18.800 --> 12:20.320
and they have never been offered any discount.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.320
Some of my co-workers now think she's into me.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.640
This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that I have been happily part of her

12:26.640 --> 12:29.840
relationship for the past four years, and we've recently gotten engaged.

12:29.840 --> 12:34.640
So my question is, is it okay for me to keep this burrito agreement and not tell this girl

12:34.640 --> 12:36.720
I'm engaged as long as she doesn't ask?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.080
That's from Question Quesadilla.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.600
This is a heavy one to start out with.

12:41.600 --> 12:47.840
What a tonal shift from Sora getting saved by Jesus Christ to this tempted by the burrito

12:47.840 --> 12:49.600
of another sort of situation.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.960
I feel like swing on by for half-priced burritos is a weird game.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.680
Is some weird game, maybe?

12:57.680 --> 13:00.080
And I don't know.

13:00.080 --> 13:07.680
I think if you have something as powerful as half-priced burritos to offer, I feel like

13:07.680 --> 13:14.000
that's a big ol' power move, because it almost ensures, like, I'm gonna see this person again.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.400
Well, it also shows I can provide for you.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.240
Yes, burritos.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.120
Which is important.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.600
My love language is half of the money that I would have to spend on burritos just being

13:23.600 --> 13:24.720
saved in my back pocket.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.880
This is a tricky one, because there's so many ways it can play out.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.320
Number one, they're not actually into you, they're just being friendly.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.680
And also, what store do you work at?

13:33.680 --> 13:34.160
That's it.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.720
Maybe they're trying to get half-price iPhone.

13:36.720 --> 13:40.080
Ooh, they're trying to get a reciprocal deal.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.320
That's entirely possible.

13:42.320 --> 13:46.720
See, but the element of this question that is kind of a, like, breaks the whole thing

13:46.720 --> 13:52.320
wide open is that none of the question askers' co-workers have been offered the same deal.

13:53.040 --> 13:53.680
You know what I mean?

13:53.680 --> 13:57.280
You know what I mean? So, like, this is unique to them.

13:57.280 --> 14:02.800
But maybe it's just all your other co-workers are drips, and you're awesome, and the person's

14:02.800 --> 14:07.600
like, I want to hang out with this person more and become friends, and it's, here's

14:07.600 --> 14:08.640
what you need to do.

14:08.640 --> 14:08.960
Okay.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.440
Bring your fiancé with you.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.040
This is not good.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.000
That's not good.

14:14.000 --> 14:14.320
What?

14:15.440 --> 14:16.400
I think-

14:16.400 --> 14:21.600
The only other option, like, if you feel bad, is to say, like, hey, I appreciate the half-price

14:21.600 --> 14:25.120
burritos, but you should know I'm in a relationship.

14:25.120 --> 14:25.360
No.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.440
And that's, like, the worst thing I can do.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.200
No, but here's the problem.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.520
There's a very different version of this question that we could get that's like, hey, I've been

14:33.520 --> 14:40.320
trying to hit on this guy with some low-price Mexican cuisine, and he just brought in his

14:40.320 --> 14:41.040
fiancé.

14:41.040 --> 14:44.640
Do I have to keep giving him these great burritos?

14:44.640 --> 14:45.920
Damn, you're right.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.800
I'm also assuming the gender of the question asker, which I shouldn't do because we have

14:50.800 --> 14:55.040
no idea, but whoever it is, I feel like that's not-

14:55.040 --> 14:55.760
Here's the thing.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.920
If you're getting half-price burritos, folks, the half of the price has to come from somewhere,

14:59.920 --> 15:02.320
and maybe it's coming from this employee.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.480
Maybe it's coming from Mr. Bell.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.800
I don't know, but it's coming from somewhere.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.760
Mr. Kedoba.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.920
Somewhere along the chain, a piper is not getting paid, and I think that you could do

15:11.920 --> 15:13.840
that a couple times and feel okay about it.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.360
It's not a permanent solution, though.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.800
I don't think you could do that permanently.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.840
I don't feel great about that.

15:17.840 --> 15:22.800
I feel like somebody, eventually the game's going to get got, and if you're just in it

15:22.800 --> 15:29.200
for the free burritos and not the camaraderie or the companionship, I feel like maybe it's

15:29.200 --> 15:33.920
time to let this particular hookup slide on by, unless you can reciprocate with a hookup.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.440
You start bringing them burritos.

15:35.440 --> 15:41.600
You start bringing them a half of a burrito, Travis, from a different, better place.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.880
And then you glue it to the burrito they gave you, and you hand it back and say,

15:44.880 --> 15:49.840
good as new. I got this out of Kedoba, and I know you're probably not legally allowed

15:49.840 --> 15:53.280
to go into Kedoba, so here's a Kedoba burrito.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.640
I like how you say that.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.440
What, Kedoba?

15:55.440 --> 15:56.320
How would you say it?

15:56.320 --> 15:57.120
I don't know.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.240
I've just never said it out loud because I've been afraid of doing it wrong.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.560
Well, I live with no fear.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.600
I do not have any limits.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.640
It's 2019.

16:06.640 --> 16:07.840
I'm becoming the monster.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.440
Let the big dog eat.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.080
If Travis actually says Kedoba out loud, he loses his powers.

16:14.080 --> 16:14.880
I can't.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.480
I can't say Kedoba out.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.440
Oh, no!

16:17.440 --> 16:19.520
My tricks have finally paid off.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.400
How about a Yahoo?

16:20.400 --> 16:22.080
I want to pivot.

16:22.080 --> 16:22.640
Okay.

16:22.640 --> 16:22.960
Yeah.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.440
The power is in your hands.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.160
Here's a Yahoo.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.920
This one was sent in by Emily Shock.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.400
Thanks, Emily.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.000
It's a Yahoo Answers user.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.240
FN2187, which I believe is the Star Wars guy.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.320
Wait, when did the first Star Wars movie come out?

16:38.320 --> 16:41.280
I mean, the, I guess, seventh one come out.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.160
That was when?

16:42.160 --> 16:43.200
That was fairly recent.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.160
That was while I was living in Austin.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.880
I think it was like 2014, 2015, something like that.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.320
FN2187, which is the name of the Star Wars guy,

16:50.320 --> 16:53.520
has been a member since May 7th, 2007.

16:54.480 --> 16:59.520
So they just happened to, I'm guessing the Star Wars

16:59.520 --> 17:02.640
stole their shit from this Yahoo Answers user?

17:02.640 --> 17:04.240
Or they changed their username.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.360
No.

17:05.360 --> 17:10.800
So they ask, my dreams be having 10 to 30 second commercials.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.000
Is this normal?

17:12.000 --> 17:12.720
Yes.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.440
No lie.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.120
I can't make things like this up.

17:15.840 --> 17:16.480
You could.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.800
I normally don't remember my dreams,

17:18.800 --> 17:21.120
but when this happens, it helps me remember them.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.920
Y'all ever have sort of like, you're enjoying a dream.

17:25.920 --> 17:33.920
You're, you know, flying a jumbo jet with Richard Dreyfuss

17:33.920 --> 17:37.600
and suddenly he turns into a piranha plant from Mario

17:37.600 --> 17:39.680
and then all of a sudden you're fully erect

17:39.680 --> 17:41.680
and you're like, what is this gonna?

17:41.680 --> 17:44.240
And then it's just like, you know, you get to,

17:44.240 --> 17:47.600
you watch the Gillette commercial,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.280
the one everybody's talking about.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.680
All the advertising my dreams is native advertising.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.840
Like it happens in the, like I would be flying

17:53.840 --> 17:57.120
with Richard Dreyfuss so that Mario would show up

17:57.120 --> 18:00.400
and then he would pull out a Gillette razor

18:00.400 --> 18:02.000
and start shaving his mustache

18:02.000 --> 18:04.560
and talking about how smooth the shave it is

18:04.560 --> 18:07.040
and how it's making him a better person

18:07.040 --> 18:08.560
and not a jerk all the time.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.280
Yeah, sure.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.880
Sure, we do co-branded campaigns.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.680
So it is original content and then at the end,

18:18.400 --> 18:20.880
it just is like sponsored by Chevrolet.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.480
Oh, that's nice.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.400
And it's not about the product, right?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.320
Like the car might be in it for like a second,

18:26.880 --> 18:32.640
but really it's more about like I'm driving like a car

18:32.640 --> 18:34.640
and I'm naked and my teeth fall out

18:35.200 --> 18:38.000
and then the car explodes and then I'm a lizard

18:38.000 --> 18:41.120
and then I can fly and then at the end,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.200
it's like sponsored by Chevrolet.

18:43.840 --> 18:44.480
Yeah.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.120
Don't you guys think, isn't the weirdest part of a dream

18:47.120 --> 18:49.600
always where like you get to the end of the story

18:49.600 --> 18:51.200
in the dream, but you're not awake yet.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.080
So then everybody in the dream just kind of stands around

18:54.080 --> 18:55.920
kind of like hands in pockets.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.000
And it goes on for like a long time

18:58.000 --> 19:00.320
until they look at you and say, wake up,

19:00.320 --> 19:01.760
please, we're really bored.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.640
And then you wake up, but you're still in the dream

19:04.640 --> 19:05.760
brought to you by Chevrolet.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.360
Yeah, the problem is when you take one of the commercial pills

19:09.360 --> 19:10.960
that implants it in your mind

19:10.960 --> 19:13.120
so that you can see it when you dream.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.560
That Morpheus gives you.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.200
Morpheus gives you.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.520
It's hard to flush those out sometimes.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.680
So you get them, I'm still getting commercials

19:19.680 --> 19:21.040
for the Fire Fest.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.560
I'm still getting those in there.

19:22.560 --> 19:27.120
So I'll be having a dream where me and Robert Lozier

19:27.120 --> 19:31.680
are having a huge fist fight on the moon

19:31.680 --> 19:34.160
and then all of a sudden Ja Rule pops up

19:34.160 --> 19:36.960
and I'm like awake enough to say like,

19:36.960 --> 19:38.560
Ja, you got to get out of there, bud.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.160
You got to get out of there, bud.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.560
Bud, it's not going to happen for you this time.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.280
You need to go.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.560
But every time it still goes and he still does it.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.560
Ah, shoot.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.480
You know, here's the thing that's really fucking me up

19:52.480 --> 20:04.080
is I bought ads in my own dream.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.760
And this is early days.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.680
Early days of my brother, my brother and me

20:07.680 --> 20:09.600
just to try to get some buzz going.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.200
And so now I'm right now having a hard time

20:13.840 --> 20:16.320
telling if this is a dream that I'm dreaming

20:16.320 --> 20:18.480
with an ad for my own podcast in it

20:18.480 --> 20:20.240
or if I'm actually sitting here recording.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.600
Don't try to fucking freak my bean, dude,

20:23.600 --> 20:25.600
because it's early and it'll work.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.880
And I can't have that kind of schism.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.800
I'm not trying to freak your bean.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.640
I'm living in my own bean freak

20:30.640 --> 20:32.000
and you're just here for the ride.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.880
You know what I mean?

20:32.880 --> 20:37.040
Wow, I have this occasional part time job

20:37.040 --> 20:39.520
as kind of a secret shopper

20:39.520 --> 20:42.400
where I go to restaurants, gas stations and the like,

20:42.400 --> 20:44.480
OK, I'm going to stop real quick.

20:44.480 --> 20:49.200
If you say my job is, quote, kind of a secret shopper,

20:49.200 --> 20:53.280
I assume you are a thief or a murderer.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.720
The most suspicious, suspicious intro possible.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.360
OK, I have the occasional part time job

21:01.360 --> 21:03.280
as kind of a secret shopper

21:03.280 --> 21:05.520
where I go to restaurants, gas stations and the like

21:05.520 --> 21:07.920
and attempt to buy alcohol or cigarettes

21:07.920 --> 21:11.280
and test the cashier server checks for ID.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.520
I cannot get over Justin.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.600
You have made me realize how much secret shopper

21:15.600 --> 21:17.680
sounds like a euphemism for a shoplifter.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.440
Yes, like I shop in secret.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.320
Occasional part time secret shopper

21:22.320 --> 21:23.840
sounds like you're a shoplifter 100%.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.240
I'm 23 but I look 17.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.040
So most of the time the employee passes this weird test.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.640
I'm not given a script or anything,

21:30.640 --> 21:31.920
but the goal is to appear to be

21:31.920 --> 21:34.720
somewhat normal shopper slash diner.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.880
Recently, I've been tasked with attempting to buy vapes.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.080
I don't vape or have friends who vape,

21:42.080 --> 21:44.480
so I don't really have to ask a cashier for a vape

21:44.480 --> 21:46.400
without sounding completely unbelievable.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.480
Brothers, how does one try to buy a vape

21:48.480 --> 21:50.240
without sounding like a cop?

21:50.240 --> 21:52.560
That's from vexed about vapes in Chicago.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.880
One vape, please.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.560
Yeah, vape me.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.440
Vape me up.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.880
I'm just now remembering,

21:58.880 --> 22:02.400
I just had a very vivid memory of being in high school

22:02.400 --> 22:06.240
and another friend trying to recruit me

22:06.240 --> 22:08.080
into one of these programs.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.360
Like to be an undercover narc, right?

22:11.360 --> 22:16.560
Where they send teenagers in to buy cigarettes

22:16.560 --> 22:19.360
and if they let them, then the place gets in trouble.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.280
It's only now occurring to me that this thing

22:21.920 --> 22:24.800
where it's a real adult pretending to be underage

22:24.800 --> 22:29.840
makes a lot more sense from sort of a legal perspective

22:29.840 --> 22:33.360
than sending 16-year-old narcs in to buy smokes.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.720
But also, to that point, J-Man,

22:36.720 --> 22:40.480
selling cigarettes or vapes to a 23-year-old

22:40.480 --> 22:42.160
is in no way illegal.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.720
Now, I get that you're supposed to check IDs

22:44.720 --> 22:48.160
if they look under 35, which is bonkers,

22:48.160 --> 22:50.560
but that idea of like, whoa, you're in trouble

22:50.560 --> 22:52.160
because that could have been a teen.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.280
It's like, yeah, but it wasn't.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.920
Yeah, but like, my thing was entrapment.

22:55.920 --> 22:59.280
So I could see where that would be a problem.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.440
And you did slink around in those leather pants

23:01.440 --> 23:02.240
to buy those cigarettes.

23:02.240 --> 23:08.400
I had a stippled-on beard that I thought was convincing.

23:08.400 --> 23:12.800
But I had to deal with this while working at GameStop

23:12.800 --> 23:15.920
because pretty close to the end of my tenure

23:15.920 --> 23:19.280
with that great company, they instituted policy

23:19.280 --> 23:21.840
where you did have to like ID people

23:21.840 --> 23:23.840
if they were trying to buy a mature-rated game

23:25.040 --> 23:27.520
because, you know, an 18-year-old

23:27.520 --> 23:30.080
who comes in to buy Call of Duty 9

23:30.800 --> 23:32.880
for sure is gonna have their ID on them.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.680
They are for sure, they do know how to drive a car

23:35.680 --> 23:36.720
and they're very good at it.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.640
And every time that someone would come up

23:40.640 --> 23:42.400
and buy a mature-rated game,

23:42.400 --> 23:45.120
I would assume they were a secret shopper,

23:45.120 --> 23:47.440
which never worked because I never actually got one.

23:47.440 --> 23:51.200
But if I had, boy, would they have been flummoxed.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.560
I would be like, oh, wanna buy this mature blood game, huh?

23:55.760 --> 23:56.320
Gotcha.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.000
Okay, so it depends.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.800
Part of this is like if you're going into a vape shop proper

24:04.800 --> 24:11.040
or you're going into Speedway to just buy a vape

24:11.040 --> 24:12.880
because those, they don't give a shit.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.360
You could wander in there and say like,

24:15.360 --> 24:18.320
I need, I don't know, a vape.

24:18.320 --> 24:22.560
And they're not gonna have the sort of expertise

24:22.560 --> 24:25.280
to guide you to the proper vaping experience.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.080
If you're at a vape shop proper,

24:28.080 --> 24:30.160
I think that that becomes a lot harder.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.760
I think that because you're not gonna know,

24:33.120 --> 24:36.160
you know, the terms and all the slang.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.240
So as I understand it from my years in the game,

24:40.240 --> 24:44.880
you go in, you say, I need to, okay, here's the thing.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.720
I got it, I got you, I got a solution.

24:46.720 --> 24:47.520
Okay, here's the solution.

24:47.520 --> 24:52.320
You don't go in equipment focus or slang focus

24:52.320 --> 24:56.640
or juice focus, you go in outcome focus.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.240
You go in and say, I wanna crank so much cotton

25:02.240 --> 25:04.080
that my mom has to leave the room.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.680
Yeah, and then reverse engineer.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.720
Yes, exactly.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.680
Here's my end goal is I wanna crank

25:11.680 --> 25:15.280
some serious fucking dragon's breath, my man.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.360
And I don't know how to achieve that.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.640
And I want it to also have nicotine for sure,

25:20.640 --> 25:22.800
you know, the illegal stuff.

25:22.800 --> 25:26.640
So that's my outcome, that's my solution.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.360
I need you to get focused on the steps we take

25:29.360 --> 25:33.680
to get there vis-a-vis equipment and technology

25:33.680 --> 25:35.920
and implants, whatever it takes.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.240
Yeah, cause it's like building a lightsaber, right?

25:39.040 --> 25:41.200
You're gonna go through every step with them

25:43.040 --> 25:45.120
and that's how you're gonna master it, right?

25:45.120 --> 25:48.080
And I guarantee someone working at a vape shop

25:48.080 --> 25:51.280
and that's like their job is gonna be super excited

25:51.280 --> 25:54.160
to have some kind of like goal that they're chasing

25:54.160 --> 25:55.920
and not just like give me some great vape.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.840
I imagine there's gonna be a lot of like

25:57.840 --> 26:01.120
steepling of the fingers and let me just,

26:04.560 --> 26:06.560
do you like cinnamon?

26:07.520 --> 26:12.320
We've gotten some new carbides from Vienna, right?

26:12.320 --> 26:15.280
And then they like roll out like kind of a jeweler's mat.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.240
You know?

26:16.240 --> 26:18.720
I'm sorry, I'm just so obsessed with this idea

26:18.720 --> 26:21.440
of your vape rig having to be like your lightsaber

26:21.440 --> 26:25.040
that you put together and choosing the Kyber crystal

26:25.040 --> 26:26.480
that goes inside of it.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.880
And you have to make, I feel like everybody

26:28.880 --> 26:30.800
should have to make their own vape rig.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.480
I don't think you should be able to buy them.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.280
I think it should, this is my vape rig.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.520
There are many like them, but this one is mine.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.440
It's how you learn the responsibility.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.240
You know what I mean?

26:40.240 --> 26:44.800
Like yes, I shape this with my will.

26:44.800 --> 26:49.040
I was thinking about vapes that look like other things

26:49.040 --> 26:50.320
because I'm sure someone has made

26:50.320 --> 26:51.840
like a huge lightsaber vape.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.880
The ones I've seen on the street

26:52.880 --> 26:54.400
all look like lightsabers anyway.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.400
So I typed in sonic screwdriver

26:56.400 --> 27:00.800
and I'm very upset with Google

27:00.800 --> 27:02.640
and what Google thinks of me

27:02.640 --> 27:05.680
because the auto complete from sonic screwdriver

27:05.680 --> 27:07.600
is sonic screwdriver vape.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.160
And so like Google has my fucking number

27:10.160 --> 27:11.600
in a major way.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.880
Oh no.

27:12.880 --> 27:16.320
You could have poking out of your shirt pocket

27:16.320 --> 27:21.440
a ticket for an R-rated movie.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.960
And so you can walk in and be like,

27:22.960 --> 27:23.920
I would like to buy a vape.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.440
And they're like, wait a minute, how?

27:25.440 --> 27:26.800
And then they'll look in your pocket

27:26.800 --> 27:27.920
and what's that say?

27:27.920 --> 27:28.960
Fatal attraction.

27:30.160 --> 27:30.880
Well.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.880
Well you must be 40 years old.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.960
If you have a fatal attraction ticket,

27:34.960 --> 27:36.080
you're good to go.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.120
Or maybe just walk in with like holding a baby.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.440
And then you're like, I would like to buy a vape.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.240
And they're like, well,

27:42.240 --> 27:44.720
they have a baby with them.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.520
Hurry it up.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.400
Me and this baby have to go see fatal attraction.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.040
And then I've got to pay my taxes.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.880
My taxes I have as an adult.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.040
Car insurance.

27:55.040 --> 27:55.680
Am I right?

27:55.680 --> 27:58.400
I think you can't bring a baby into a vape shop.

27:58.400 --> 27:58.960
I'm not.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.440
I'm going to revoke that advice.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.480
I don't think you can.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.200
No, no, no.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.560
The baby's 26.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.880
Can you guys not vape just for like a little bit?

28:06.880 --> 28:09.600
Just like clear it out in here.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.320
Can everyone stop?

28:10.320 --> 28:11.840
The baby's a cop too.

28:11.840 --> 28:12.320
Yeah.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.360
And it is a baby,

28:13.360 --> 28:16.160
but it's trained for this shit.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.600
It only exhales.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.680
This baby's getting too old for this shit.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.400
Because he's four and he's pretending to be a vape baby.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.920
A vape bait baby.

28:23.920 --> 28:27.040
I'd bring him to vape shops to see if they let me have a baby in here.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.720
You've been busted.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.560
This is my vape baby vape-ster.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.200
I'd bring vape-ster into vape shops

28:33.200 --> 28:36.800
and see if they make me take the vape, my vape, vape baby out.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.120
My vape, vape, vape, vape, vape baby.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.400
And it's legal to have a baby in a vape shop.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.160
So the vape shop doesn't throw you out with the baby.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.360
Then they're busted.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.200
That's a double illegal crime.

28:49.200 --> 28:54.640
Well, let's not throw the vape fog out with the baby water.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.680
Should we go to the money zone?

28:55.680 --> 28:57.120
We're already there.

28:57.120 --> 28:57.840
Look around you.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.200
I built it when you weren't looking.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.080
Now I'm breaking over the entrance.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.680
So you're trapped here forever.

29:03.680 --> 29:07.520
Oh no, I've been, I've been cask of a mamba, a monologue.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.280
No, you got it right, Ferris.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.440
It's cask of a mamba number five a lotto.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.440
Correct.

29:24.480 --> 29:27.760
Hey, I want to tell you all about me undies because Valentine's Day.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.320
Hard pass.

29:28.320 --> 29:28.560
What?

29:28.560 --> 29:29.360
Hard pass.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.400
Why?

29:30.400 --> 29:32.320
I don't want to know about your undies.

29:33.120 --> 29:33.760
Oh, I see.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.120
Oh, this is a silly episode.

29:37.120 --> 29:42.080
Yeah, we're having fun not getting the things done that we got to get done in this one contractually.

29:42.080 --> 29:48.640
But me undies is great for Valentine's Day because they're, first of all, quality underwear.

29:48.640 --> 29:52.560
They're made out of micromodal fabric, which is three times softer than cotton.

29:52.560 --> 29:56.240
And you can choose from four different cuts of underwear.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.480
There's the prime cut.

29:58.480 --> 30:02.000
There's the flank.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.240
You can get a porterhouse underwear, all of which are available from-

30:06.240 --> 30:07.760
Mine's a T-bone.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.280
Yeah, from Classic Colors.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.800
Ew, Travis!

30:10.800 --> 30:12.800
Travis!

30:12.800 --> 30:13.920
That was a finger.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.240
It was a stinker.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.120
Yikes.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.720
And it's got adventurous prints.

30:20.560 --> 30:24.080
I recently Marie Kondo'd my whole wardrobe.

30:24.080 --> 30:29.120
And so now I am happy to say that pretty much all the underwear I own is me undies, and that's great.

30:29.120 --> 30:37.120
And for Christmas, Rachel got me a me undies onesie that when I was in town in Huntington

30:37.840 --> 30:40.560
for the holidays, you could not get me out of.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.280
It's true.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.480
Yeah, so Valentine's Day, it's a great gift.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.640
And they have lounge pants as well.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.960
So me undies has a great offer for our listeners.

30:48.960 --> 30:53.520
If you want to get 15% off your first pair, free shipping, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee,

30:53.520 --> 30:56.160
go to meundies.com slash my brother.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.120
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.080
All one word.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.240
I would like to tell you about Stitch Fix.

31:02.240 --> 31:02.880
Do it, Howard.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.840
I don't know who was at-

31:05.840 --> 31:07.360
I don't know who was at PodCon.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.800
And I don't know who's seen pictures of PodCon.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.080
Oh, shit.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.840
But I got this sweater.

31:11.840 --> 31:16.960
Well, one, okay, everything in the getting ready room for all the podcasters.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.840
Everybody.

31:17.840 --> 31:18.400
Everybody.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.720
I think Hank and I were wearing the same pants at one point.

31:20.720 --> 31:25.520
I fucking ran into Hank at the airport wearing the sweater that I saw him wear.

31:26.080 --> 31:29.600
I packed the sweater that I saw him wearing during the opening ceremony.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.800
And I had it.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.200
It was my only clean shirt left on the day I was traveling home.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.240
And it's like, oh, it's fine.

31:34.240 --> 31:34.960
I won't see Hank.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.960
Saw him in the fucking airport line.

31:36.960 --> 31:42.400
But basically, anyone who has tried Stitch Fix is like into it.

31:42.400 --> 31:42.960
Yes.

31:42.960 --> 31:47.040
I got this sweater that I wore at PodCon that had like a blue bow on it.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.160
And like nonstop-

31:48.160 --> 31:49.360
That was a Stitch Fix?

31:49.360 --> 31:50.160
Yeah.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.360
Damn, that's a good sweater.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.720
I know, nonstop.

31:52.720 --> 31:55.040
People are like, great sweater, great sweater, great sweater.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.640
And that's the thing is if you're looking to up your game, Stitch Fix is the way to do it

31:58.640 --> 32:00.480
because they don't just send you stuff.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.440
Like they talk to you.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.320
They ask you questions.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.200
They say, what do you like?

32:03.200 --> 32:03.920
Do you like this?

32:03.920 --> 32:08.000
And they also ask you, and this is my favorite thing, price ranges that you're comfortable

32:08.000 --> 32:09.200
spending on clothes.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.320
Because I know like I don't want a $200 t-shirt.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.840
Like me and Macklemore both agree that's ridiculous.

32:15.840 --> 32:19.120
And so you would say like, I don't want to pay more than blank for a t-shirt.

32:19.120 --> 32:23.120
So they tailor not only the style, but the prices to you as well.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.240
And you work with a personal stylist who will handpick those items for you.

32:26.240 --> 32:31.040
And then if you don't like something, you send it back and you don't have to pay for it.

32:31.040 --> 32:36.720
And that also helps them shape your profile so that the next time it's even more accurate.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.000
How do I get this box?

32:38.000 --> 32:38.960
How do I get this wonderful box?

32:38.960 --> 32:40.320

Hello, this is Amy Mann.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.400
And I'm Ted Leo.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.120
And we have a podcast called The Art of Process.

33:03.120 --> 33:07.840
We're talking about how the creative process is in itself an art form in our opinion.

33:07.840 --> 33:13.360
There are underlying forms and structures that serve as a scaffolding for any creative endeavor.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.960
We've been lucky enough over the past year to talk to some of our friends and acquaintances

33:16.960 --> 33:20.400
from across the creative spectrum to find out how they actually work.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.440
We weirdly don't know as many musicians as you would expect.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.760
New episodes will be coming every other Monday.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.440
Starting January 28th.

33:27.440 --> 33:33.440
So please listen and subscribe at maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcast.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.600
Do y'all want a Yahoo?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.040
I would love that, Griffin.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.080
It's sent in by Sid Ross, this Yahoo Answers user.

33:42.080 --> 33:42.580
Shh.

33:43.520 --> 33:48.400
Who asks, can a locksmith break into every door?

33:51.040 --> 33:54.320
This one I wanted to talk about because-

33:54.960 --> 33:55.460
Okay.

33:56.000 --> 33:56.560
I would hope.

33:56.560 --> 34:01.840
A locksmith can just kind of get in there.

34:02.800 --> 34:07.200
A locksmith motto could be we just get in there.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.320
When you can't get in there and you need to and it's yours,

34:10.320 --> 34:12.000
the locksmith will be there for you.

34:12.720 --> 34:18.480
That seems wild to me that there's a career, a profession in there.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.720
There's probably a career out there called lock maker.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.640
And then there's an evil sort of in-

34:24.640 --> 34:26.320
I'm not saying all locksmiths are evil,

34:26.320 --> 34:27.840
but I'm saying if they could be,

34:28.560 --> 34:31.680
you know how they don't trust the X-Men because of their mutant powers

34:31.680 --> 34:33.680
and they could do infinite evil with it?

34:33.680 --> 34:37.280
I'm just saying I don't know why we're sort of allowing locksmiths

34:37.280 --> 34:40.960
to be so footloose and fancy free with their stuff.

34:40.960 --> 34:41.920
I don't know.

34:41.920 --> 34:45.120
I'm sitting here trying to think of another profession

34:45.120 --> 34:49.520
that is so closely related to like burglaring.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.240
You know, like there is not another-

34:52.240 --> 34:54.640
It's not like, oh yeah, I'm a wall scaler.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.560
If you need me to scale,

34:58.480 --> 35:01.760
I'm a professional guy who cuts holes in skylights.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.720
If you've ever locked your keys in your home

35:06.720 --> 35:09.200
and then had to call a locksmith to come help you out,

35:09.200 --> 35:11.920
I think that it is a universal human experience

35:11.920 --> 35:14.640
to watch someone break into your door in 20 seconds and go, huh.

35:14.640 --> 35:19.200
Yeah, okay, huh.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.160
Locksmiths, if you can at least pretend like it's a challenge

35:22.160 --> 35:22.800
and sit there and be like,

35:22.800 --> 35:25.040
well, this is the toughest lock I've ever seen.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.880
Something like that just to make me feel like,

35:26.880 --> 35:29.120
oh, this is going to take me at least an hour and a half

35:29.120 --> 35:31.840
giving you plenty of time to call the police if you needed to,

35:31.840 --> 35:32.800
but you don't.

35:32.800 --> 35:37.920
Pulling this lock requires an extremely loud drill.

35:37.920 --> 35:41.760
A rare tool that only I own and will melt down after I'm done over.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.120
Here, I'm going to leave this with you.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.640
Only I know how to unlock this door.

35:46.640 --> 35:47.280
Now kill me.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.560
That'll be $150.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.520
Good, now kill me.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.360
Kill me, that's the only way you're safe.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.440
That'll be $150 for another 50.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.000
You can clip out my tongue with these hedge trimmers.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.160
Now drive this ice pick up my nose.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.520
Nope, a little to the left.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.640
Got it, there he goes.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.080
Now that you think about it,

36:09.680 --> 36:12.160
it's like paying somebody to point a knife at you.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.560
I'm not saying that there shouldn't be locksmiths.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.880
I'm not saying that all locksmiths are using their powers.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.080
Probably most aren't.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.240
That's probably a pretty good way to lose.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.920
Most locksmiths are not.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.680
Yes, but I mean,

36:25.680 --> 36:32.720
I mean, there needs to be a checks and balances system.

36:33.280 --> 36:38.320
Do you think they show up for monthly meetings of a locksmith union or something and they're like,

36:38.320 --> 36:39.680
what, where's Debbie?

36:39.680 --> 36:41.360
It was like, oh, she went rogue.

36:41.360 --> 36:41.600
Yeah.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.600
Oh no, yeah, she went to the dark side.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.440
Debbie's a rogue nation now.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.680
Yeah, well, we're going to have to hunt her and bring her in

36:49.680 --> 36:52.560
so that she doesn't give other locksmiths a bad name.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.600
But she's in a house behind 11 locked doors.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.560
Oh no.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.040
Are you guys tough enough for this challenge?

37:02.080 --> 37:03.120
Yeah, just saying.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.240
So anyway, let's keep an eye out.

37:07.120 --> 37:12.240
Become the monster, but still be, you know, just keep an eye on locksmiths.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.080
Do you think that every locksmith owns in their possession

37:16.080 --> 37:18.640
a small locked box that they cannot open?

37:18.640 --> 37:23.280
And if they do, they die?

37:23.280 --> 37:24.720
The paradox lock.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.800
Because they want to open it because it's a challenge, right?

37:30.800 --> 37:35.600
Like they love doing, they love picking locks.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.920
And it's like, hey, here's a lock that's unique to you.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.240
No one else has ever picked this lock before.

37:40.240 --> 37:40.880
Yeah.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.840
But if you open it, you die.

37:43.840 --> 37:48.480
Well, there's a pandemonium cube and locksmiths read it

37:48.480 --> 37:50.720
as always blowing up about the pandemonium cube

37:50.720 --> 37:53.120
because somebody's like, Debbie shows up and Debbie's like,

37:53.120 --> 37:54.560
I think I got it, I think I got it.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.760
And then she tries to pick it.

37:55.760 --> 37:58.240
And then she, of course, gets turned into a skeleton

37:58.240 --> 38:03.920
because she didn't, she forgot to turn that one sort of bust of the devil.

38:03.920 --> 38:08.560
There's also the million fasted crystal of Akumara that a lot of people,

38:08.560 --> 38:11.040
of course, you need a lot of souls to unlock that.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.640
And that one's tricky.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.720
Some people will tell you they're connected

38:14.720 --> 38:16.160
and you need one to unlock the other.

38:16.880 --> 38:17.680
I don't know.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.280
I mean, we can talk about it in the forums all day.

38:21.280 --> 38:21.920
You know what I mean?

38:21.920 --> 38:23.600
But when it comes down to it,

38:23.600 --> 38:28.160
I guess I'm just afraid of the power of the locksmith that opens it.

38:28.160 --> 38:28.800
Yes, yes.

38:28.800 --> 38:29.760
And what they might become.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.320
Especially because they will definitely need to be in possession

38:32.320 --> 38:34.000
of Igalatia's screaming blade.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.360
And I feel like that is what really trips me out.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.440
And the 100 wishes you get from the pandemonium cube

38:41.440 --> 38:44.160
just seems excessive because you're going to change everything.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.640
It seems like that amount of wishes is designed

38:46.640 --> 38:49.680
to make you lose track of how many you have left.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.760
Because it's not as though there's a counter on there.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.200
Well, there might be.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.720
Nobody's been inside the pandemonium.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.000
There might be a little like LL.

38:56.000 --> 39:01.040
Well, that's not necessarily true, Griffin,

39:01.040 --> 39:04.320
because I have heard voices from inside the pandemonium cube

39:04.320 --> 39:07.440
whispering to me the lock combination.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.600
And I don't know if I trust it.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.080
That's a trick.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.360
They want to turn you into bones, Trav.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.240
That's a trick.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.360
That's an old trick.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.120
You know fucking better than that.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.280
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

39:17.280 --> 39:17.600
What?

39:17.600 --> 39:20.880
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.960
This is what the voice sounds like.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.080
I want a munch.

39:26.720 --> 39:27.200
Squad.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.120
I want too much.

39:31.680 --> 39:32.160
Squad?

39:32.160 --> 39:34.720
D, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.280
It's a little sad this year for Valentine's Day

39:37.280 --> 39:41.040
that because of the Necco company going out of business,

39:41.040 --> 39:43.760
we're not going to have the conversation hearts just like-

39:43.760 --> 39:44.080
What?

39:44.080 --> 39:45.040
Right?

39:45.040 --> 39:45.680
Yeah.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.200
I didn't know that happened.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.000
Yeah, bud.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.400
Necco's out of business and there's no candy hearts.

39:52.400 --> 39:58.480
It seems wild that someone hasn't like swooped in and just like-

39:58.480 --> 40:03.600
Oh, swooped in and inherited that incredibly successful

40:03.600 --> 40:06.080
business plan of making yucky chalk candy

40:06.080 --> 40:07.600
that got them closed down?

40:07.600 --> 40:08.640
They have been bought.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.560
The Necco company has been bought by the people who make-

40:15.920 --> 40:16.400
Chalk.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.600
No, the dumb, dumb people.

40:20.240 --> 40:22.560
But they didn't have time to make the new ones this year.

40:22.560 --> 40:23.760
So there is a gap, right?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.320
Anywhere there's a gap in culture,

40:26.880 --> 40:32.240
you can count on one company that's always 1k away from disaster.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.360
It's Krispy Kreme and they're introducing a line

40:35.360 --> 40:37.840
of Valentine's conversation heart donuts.

40:37.840 --> 40:38.340
Ooh.

40:39.520 --> 40:44.000
And they are basically just doing the thing

40:44.000 --> 40:47.200
that they're not sure if anyone could sue them,

40:47.200 --> 40:48.160
is what I would guess.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.360
Currently, they're not sure who would sue them.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.280
So they're just going to go ahead and do it.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.280
And it's just donuts that look like those,

40:55.280 --> 40:57.840
except they're very big and they have phrases like,

40:57.840 --> 41:02.240
I heart you or pick me or all the feels.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.760
Oh, yowza!

41:05.760 --> 41:09.680
Hachi-machi, folks. Hey, folks, this is for maybe you.

41:09.680 --> 41:10.880
Real quick sidebar.

41:11.760 --> 41:15.920
Emotions are the thing that make life worth living

41:15.920 --> 41:21.120
and separate us from sort of the animals and refrigerators

41:21.120 --> 41:23.040
and all the other things that aren't people.

41:23.040 --> 41:26.160
Can we not reduce the entire human experience

41:26.160 --> 41:27.920
to the word feels?

41:27.920 --> 41:32.320
Can we just be sad or happy or horny for donuts

41:32.320 --> 41:33.520
or whatever it may be?

41:33.520 --> 41:36.720
Anyway, so these are giant conversational hearts

41:36.720 --> 41:39.440
that say things and they also say DM me on them.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.640
So fuck it, I guess.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.640
Fuck it, anything goes.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.960
Why do they want you to play Dungeons and Dragons with them?

41:44.960 --> 41:46.480
They got Hachi-machi.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.760
They got four classic Krispy Kreme fillings.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.760
That classic is spelled with the C.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.280
Do not fret.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.800
Cake batter, strawberries and cream,

41:57.840 --> 41:59.840
raspberry filled and chocolate cream.

41:59.840 --> 42:00.400
Mystery.

42:00.400 --> 42:00.960
Mystery.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.960
Cream. Power.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.480
Loose flour.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.040
Spare change.

42:10.400 --> 42:14.960
Finding the right word can be like, I don't know, hard.

42:15.920 --> 42:18.080
And there's a four dot ellipses here.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.200
So I'm trying to punch my monitor and I'm just hurting my hand.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.320
I can't shatter the screen.

42:23.520 --> 42:25.760
But eating a donut is easy.

42:26.800 --> 42:30.800
Well, so we printed the right words on the donuts

42:30.800 --> 42:33.440
for you so you can't mess this up.

42:33.440 --> 42:38.880
Save, again, Dave Skinna, chief marketing officer

42:38.880 --> 42:41.040
for Krispy Kreme Donuts in, I would say,

42:42.480 --> 42:45.920
a rare display of how these companies do, in fact,

42:45.920 --> 42:48.720
feel about their core customer base.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.680
Hey, dumb, dumb.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.720
You know how you can't express how you feel good?

42:52.720 --> 42:54.640
We wrote DM me on a fucking donut

42:54.640 --> 42:56.880
so you can shove it your gob and cry.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.480
Anyway, eat these.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.520
No one's going to sue us.

42:59.520 --> 43:02.320
We're invincible this year.

43:03.520 --> 43:06.960
You can get one of these for free

43:07.680 --> 43:10.080
if you're a Krispy Kreme rewards member.

43:10.720 --> 43:14.160
You can get a free conversation heart donut of choice

43:14.160 --> 43:17.200
with any purchase on Wednesday, February 6th.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.320
If you're not already a rewards member, don't miss out.

43:20.320 --> 43:48.800
Sign up at H-T-T-P-S colon slash slash W-W-W dot K-R-I-S-P-Y-K-R-E-M-E dot C-O-M slash A-C-C-O-U-N-T slash C-R-E-A-T-E dash A-C-C-O-U-N-T.

43:48.800 --> 43:51.440
I look forward to someone remixing that.

43:51.440 --> 43:53.920
That is the address to sign up for it.

43:57.120 --> 43:59.520
Yeah, yeah, they couldn't get a bit.ly link going.

43:59.520 --> 44:01.280
Couldn't get a bit.ly going.

44:01.280 --> 44:08.560
And don't forget to show how you hashtag say it with donuts this Valentine's season

44:08.560 --> 44:14.160
by tagging Krispy Kreme with a photo of your favorite Valentine's Day donut phrase.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.000
And then it doesn't say this,

44:16.000 --> 44:19.280
but I would say you wanna definitely append the hashtag.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.760
Hashtag say it with donuts.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.360
You know what I like to say with donuts?

44:25.360 --> 44:25.680
What?

44:33.680 --> 44:34.400
Woman you DUMP piece of s**t

44:34.400 --> 44:38.000
I can't believe we shared that video, you made me so angry.

44:40.400 --> 44:41.520
I hate your guts.

44:41.520 --> 44:43.940
The only thing I say with donuts is,

44:43.940 --> 44:46.020
it's Saturday morning and I've given up.

44:46.020 --> 44:48.280
Those are the two things that I've.

44:48.280 --> 44:49.120
This is my day.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.440
This is my day, I guess.

44:50.440 --> 44:53.000
I guess I'm putting me on this trajectory of the day.

44:55.000 --> 44:55.840
Another question?

44:55.840 --> 44:56.660
Yeah, I'd love that.

44:56.660 --> 44:58.040
Thank you, Griffin.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.640
Thanks for reminding me of what we're here for.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.920
I hate getting haircuts for a lot of reasons,

45:03.920 --> 45:06.600
but the main one is, I have no idea

45:06.600 --> 45:09.280
what level of enthusiasm I have for them.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.880
I have no idea what level of enthusiasm

45:11.880 --> 45:14.320
I should be displaying while I get my haircut.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.800
I'm pretty awkward, so usually I don't talk

45:16.800 --> 45:19.600
with the hairdresser, meaning that I sit there in silence

45:19.600 --> 45:22.880
looking at my reflection and it seems to me

45:22.880 --> 45:25.880
to have my resting, non-smiling expression.

45:25.880 --> 45:26.720
It seems mean.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.080
It seems mean, thank you,

45:28.080 --> 45:30.320
to have my resting, non-smiling expression.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.260
I always feel like the hairdresser thinks I'm judging them,

45:32.260 --> 45:33.920
but then it feels even weirder

45:33.920 --> 45:35.320
to be smiling the whole time.

45:35.320 --> 45:37.360
Am I supposed to smirk?

45:37.360 --> 45:40.500
Should I close my eyes and pretend to be asleep?

45:40.500 --> 45:41.720
Please help.

45:41.720 --> 45:44.400
That's from anxious in the hair seat.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.960
You're deep in your own feels.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.160
Deep in there, huh?

45:47.160 --> 45:48.960
You're deep in the pocket.

45:48.960 --> 45:52.760
You need to pull up, my friend, pull up.

45:52.760 --> 45:55.000
We're all just in this thing together.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.740
You know, we're all just here together

45:56.740 --> 45:57.960
trying to work it out.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.920
I'm willing to bet money that the hairdresser

46:03.920 --> 46:05.640
is not looking in your face.

46:05.640 --> 46:08.080
They are autopiloting, haircutting,

46:08.080 --> 46:10.480
a thing that they've done 20 times a day

46:10.480 --> 46:12.620
for the last X number of years,

46:12.620 --> 46:15.080
and they're like singing a song in their head

46:15.080 --> 46:19.000
or they're thinking about their grocery list or whatever.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.240
I think you're probably okay

46:21.240 --> 46:22.800
to make whatever face you're making,

46:22.800 --> 46:25.040
but let me offer this.

46:25.040 --> 46:29.160
Come in with just a powerful scowl and stay scowling,

46:29.160 --> 46:31.120
but close your eyes while they're cutting your hair

46:31.120 --> 46:32.440
and then open your eyes

46:32.440 --> 46:34.440
and let your face break into a smile

46:34.440 --> 46:37.440
and then reach up and touch your own face.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.460
You can't imagine the feeling.

46:39.460 --> 46:40.760
What is this?

46:40.760 --> 46:43.280
And then hug them and begin to weep

46:43.280 --> 46:45.360
and then tip them 25%.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.200
Yeah.

46:46.200 --> 46:47.280
That's all, I mean, that's all excellent.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.240
Thank you, Travis.

46:49.120 --> 46:54.120
I wanna dwell on the I'm awkward so I don't talk.

46:55.400 --> 46:58.600
I think that part of that is just practice, my friends.

46:58.600 --> 47:02.320
It's, you know, awkward just means I don't know what to say,

47:02.320 --> 47:05.060
so maybe start thinking of some things

47:05.060 --> 47:06.760
that might be good to say to somebody

47:06.760 --> 47:07.720
while they're cutting their hair.

47:07.720 --> 47:09.240
You know what I like to do?

47:09.240 --> 47:10.760
I like, I have different people

47:10.760 --> 47:11.880
cut my hair every single time.

47:11.880 --> 47:14.200
I used to go to my guy Sunny up at Master Cuts.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.880
Can't always get Sunny reliably,

47:15.880 --> 47:17.280
so now I'm a vagabond.

47:17.280 --> 47:18.880
I go where the wind takes me.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.160
Last time I had my hair cut,

47:20.160 --> 47:23.160
it was in the basement of this hotel in Cincinnati

47:23.160 --> 47:26.880
when I was gonna go to BB's birthday party.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.960
I got my hair cut at eight in the morning

47:28.960 --> 47:31.320
down in some basement of a hotel.

47:31.320 --> 47:33.080
I'm, it's random for me,

47:33.080 --> 47:34.480
but you know what I like to ask somebody?

47:34.480 --> 47:36.840
How did you get started cutting hair?

47:36.840 --> 47:37.680
I'm curious.

47:37.680 --> 47:38.520
How long you been doing it?

47:38.520 --> 47:40.200
How long you been doing it?

47:40.200 --> 47:41.400
Do you like doing it?

47:41.400 --> 47:42.680
And you know what?

47:42.680 --> 47:44.800
That's just letting somebody tell you their life story.

47:44.800 --> 47:47.720
You're gonna learn a lot about the industry, the business.

47:47.720 --> 47:48.680
You're gonna learn about them.

47:48.680 --> 47:53.280
I think asking, asking questions, folks,

47:53.280 --> 47:55.720
it is very rare that you're gonna go wrong.

47:55.720 --> 47:59.240
Everybody, read your, you know, your Dale Carnegie.

47:59.240 --> 48:01.480
People wanna talk about themselves.

48:01.480 --> 48:04.520
And if you are uncomfortable talking,

48:04.520 --> 48:06.360
then you're never gonna go wrong

48:06.360 --> 48:09.040
just asking the person about their life.

48:09.040 --> 48:10.040
You're gonna learn something.

48:10.040 --> 48:11.160
You're gonna connect a little bit.

48:11.160 --> 48:12.480
It goes down smooth every time.

48:12.480 --> 48:15.280
Let the fear make you the monster.

48:15.280 --> 48:17.360
The last time I had my hair cut

48:17.360 --> 48:20.480
was by a guy on Route 60 who had a little stand

48:20.480 --> 48:25.240
with a sign outside that said, cash only, $12.

48:25.240 --> 48:27.120
Justin, what are you, what's your game?

48:27.120 --> 48:27.960
Are you okay?

48:27.960 --> 48:30.240
I went and sat down and he spent,

48:30.240 --> 48:32.880
I asked a couple of questions about this person.

48:32.880 --> 48:36.760
And then he spent 30 minutes telling me the story,

48:36.760 --> 48:41.760
the grand tale of how his wife always wants to buy things

48:43.480 --> 48:46.480
that are too large for rooms and then pick paint

48:46.480 --> 48:47.720
that's too dark for the rooms

48:47.720 --> 48:49.320
to make them seem even smaller.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.240
And he is so tripped out about this

48:51.240 --> 48:53.800
that he spent half an hour walking me on a journey

48:53.800 --> 48:57.760
through his home, which I can now picture in perfect clarity.

48:57.760 --> 49:01.280
And all the things in each room that are too large

49:01.280 --> 49:03.400
for the individual rooms.

49:03.400 --> 49:06.800
And he actually told me that when he,

49:06.800 --> 49:09.820
he hated the last color of paint so much

49:09.820 --> 49:12.760
that he asked the person that painted it

49:12.760 --> 49:14.320
to leave him his number

49:14.320 --> 49:16.960
because if his wife broke up with him,

49:16.960 --> 49:19.680
he was going to call them to have them come back

49:19.680 --> 49:23.480
and paint it a different color because he hated it so much.

49:23.480 --> 49:25.800
It was a fucking great 30 minutes

49:25.800 --> 49:28.600
and I got a great haircut out of it.

49:28.600 --> 49:30.680
Okay, but please walk me through.

49:30.680 --> 49:33.480
You were driving past and you saw a sign

49:33.480 --> 49:35.640
that said cash only $12.

49:35.640 --> 49:38.480
And you were like, screech and pulled in.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.280
Yeah, I mean, pretty much.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.080
I was at Google maps.

49:42.080 --> 49:46.320
I stopped at the stop sign and I typed barber into it.

49:46.320 --> 49:49.600
And I went to the closest place that was around,

49:49.600 --> 49:50.440
that was there.

49:50.440 --> 49:53.000
Your game is so wild.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.760
Does that make you feel alive?

49:54.760 --> 49:56.000
Is that the point?

49:56.000 --> 50:00.720
I have two hairstyles, cut and not.

50:00.720 --> 50:04.640
So it is a binary thing that is taking me

50:04.640 --> 50:06.240
from longer to shorter.

50:06.240 --> 50:07.080
That is it.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.920
That is my style.

50:08.920 --> 50:11.780
My go-to barber here in Austin made the mistake

50:11.780 --> 50:13.800
of one of our first sort of sessions together.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.240
Mentioning Pokemon.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.400
She talked about wrestling.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.040
Yeah, she mentioned a wrestling thing

50:19.040 --> 50:20.200
she'd gone to around town.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.720
It was one of two things, Justin.

50:21.720 --> 50:22.560
I thought that was the third.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.440
Well, Pokemon is basically animal wrestling.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.840
So I'm not gonna say.

50:26.840 --> 50:29.240
Yeah, I mean, especially with like a May Champ

50:29.240 --> 50:31.760
who's got that style or an Incineroar,

50:31.760 --> 50:32.600
like that one's full.

50:32.600 --> 50:33.680
And that's 15 seconds.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.080
Sorry, Griff.

50:35.080 --> 50:35.920
There it goes.

50:35.920 --> 50:36.760
Save it for next week.

50:38.200 --> 50:40.240
One last Yahoo to close out?

50:40.240 --> 50:41.080
Wait, no, no, no.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.120
Do tell me about the wrestling.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.800
It's just, you're only allowed to talk about.

50:43.800 --> 50:44.720
She talked about wrestling.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.720
Now every time I go see her, I'm like,

50:46.720 --> 50:48.860
see any good wrestling lately?

50:48.860 --> 50:50.920
But it was really just the one time.

50:50.920 --> 50:52.680
It's like how like when you're young

50:52.680 --> 50:54.680
and you mention in front of your grandparents

50:54.680 --> 50:57.160
that you are into dinosaurs

50:57.160 --> 50:58.440
because Jurassic Park just came out.

50:58.440 --> 50:59.880
And then for the next 25 years,

50:59.880 --> 51:02.160
you're getting dinosaur books, dinosaur bones,

51:02.160 --> 51:04.080
actual ones they stole from a museum.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.280
I hate, Griffin, I feel really bad

51:06.280 --> 51:08.760
because that was the way that my brain

51:08.760 --> 51:10.200
completed that anecdote.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.920
And you told it with perfect efficiency.

51:12.920 --> 51:14.360
You only told the first 10 seconds

51:14.360 --> 51:15.520
because that's all you needed.

51:15.520 --> 51:17.000
The rest of it shook out exactly the way.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.260
I'm so sorry.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.000
I wanna thank everybody for.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.760
You're welcome.

51:22.760 --> 51:25.120
Oh, come on now, Trav.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.440
Come on, bud.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.160
Razzed ya!

51:28.160 --> 51:30.840
Another famous Travis Razz.

51:30.840 --> 51:34.960
I wanna thank everybody for listening to our show.

51:34.960 --> 51:37.200
If you want more stuff that we make,

51:37.200 --> 51:41.520
go to McElroy, M-C-E-L-R-O-Y dot family,

51:41.520 --> 51:43.640
and you can find all the shows we make,

51:43.640 --> 51:48.280
all the zany videos, books,

51:48.280 --> 51:52.080
and most importantly for this particular vignette

51:52.080 --> 51:53.560
is tours.

51:54.940 --> 51:56.840
You can go on there and buy tickets

51:56.840 --> 51:57.760
to our next round of shows

51:57.760 --> 52:02.760
that are gonna be Thursday, February 7th,

52:02.760 --> 52:04.000
Birmingham, Alabama,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.520
and Sunday, February 10th,

52:07.520 --> 52:10.040
in New Orleans at the Orpheum.

52:10.040 --> 52:11.960
We're gonna be doing my bim bam at both of those.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.100
And both of those shows,

52:13.100 --> 52:14.800
the websites don't even say this yet,

52:14.800 --> 52:16.480
both of the shows are going to feature

52:16.480 --> 52:20.200
both Sawbones and Schmaners.

52:20.200 --> 52:21.960
Yeah, it's a whole lot of shows.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.880
It's a lot of show,

52:23.880 --> 52:25.920
and if you go to McElroy dot family

52:25.920 --> 52:27.760
and click on tours,

52:27.760 --> 52:31.040
then you can get tickets to those.

52:31.040 --> 52:33.160
Also, I believe there's a new Monster Factory

52:33.160 --> 52:35.060
out this week, and y'all.

52:35.060 --> 52:37.560
It's a good one.

52:37.560 --> 52:40.760
Oh no, then we gotta do the other part of that

52:40.760 --> 52:43.160
that I have not done yet, but I will.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.740
Also, on February 9th in New Orleans,

52:45.740 --> 52:47.080
we're doing the Adventure Zone,

52:47.080 --> 52:48.920
so you can get tickets for that as well.

52:50.020 --> 52:51.880
We haven't sold a lot of tickets for those,

52:51.880 --> 52:54.200
and we're probably gonna take a fucking bath on this one.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.180
Folks, come on out.

52:56.180 --> 52:57.500
We're just so excited to come visit.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.300
We're just super excited to come,

52:59.300 --> 53:02.300
but we also don't want this to be the only time we ever do

53:02.300 --> 53:03.800
because we're bankrupt,

53:03.800 --> 53:04.760
because nobody came to our show.

53:04.760 --> 53:06.220
So please come to this show.

53:07.900 --> 53:11.180
We knew that we didn't have a ton of listeners down there,

53:11.180 --> 53:12.180
but we wanted them.

53:12.180 --> 53:13.560
Why are we nagging ourselves?

53:13.560 --> 53:15.240
This show's gonna kick ass.

53:15.240 --> 53:17.040
We're gonna sell all this shit until the last day.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.040
If you fucking miss it,

53:18.040 --> 53:19.900
you're gonna be kicking your own butt.

53:19.900 --> 53:21.480
When you put us in a corner,

53:21.480 --> 53:23.800
when we don't fill a room,

53:23.800 --> 53:25.200
and we're desperate and hungry,

53:25.200 --> 53:27.920
that's when we put on the fucking best shows.

53:27.920 --> 53:28.760
Ask anybody.

53:28.760 --> 53:29.580
Ask Detroit.

53:29.580 --> 53:31.240
Ask any city in this great country.

53:31.240 --> 53:32.840
Don't ask Detroit.

53:32.840 --> 53:33.680
Don't ask Detroit.
