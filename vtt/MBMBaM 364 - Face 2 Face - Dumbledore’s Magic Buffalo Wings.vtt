WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
And their advice should never be followed.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
But if there's a diploma on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
I know it's degree, Travis.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Although this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:32.000 --> 01:00.000
crowd cheers

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
It's familiar.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
But not too familiar.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
But not too not familiar.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
It's a new craze.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Hey good girls, do you wanna?

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Just say, hey I wanna.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Just say, hey I wanna.

01:28.000 --> 01:40.000
crowd cheers

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Ladies and gentlemen, John Roderick!

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
crowd cheers

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Claire McElroy.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Thanks, both dads.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Hey, San Diego, I had a quick question for you. Do you wanna get weird?

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
crowd cheers

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I think that was a yes. That was the wrong answer.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
My MacBook Pro has 69% battery, it's a sign!

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
crowd cheers

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Nice, nice, nice.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
If all the owls, instead of saying, who?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
All said, nice.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Does a bear nice in the woods? Who knows?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I'd probably camp more if owls were like, nice.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Do you wanna introduce the show, Justin?

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
crowd cheers

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
crowd cheers

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
crowd cheers

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Travis fucking,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
I wanna break down what just happened. Travis fucking waited until Justin's

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
cheer died down so there was no cross-pollination. I wanted it to be clear.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Hi, I'm 30 under 30 media luminary and baby brother

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Griffin McElroy.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
crowd cheers

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
You know, here's what's up. I was about to say, one of these days we'll have to

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
do it in reverse order. I'm in the middle either way.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
That's a lot of Hennessy!

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
It's a lot of ginger ale, it's a big cup.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
It's a small amount of Hennessy, it just looks large from where you're seated.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
You ever call it hinger ale?

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
No, it's called a horse's neck.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Okay, I'll just do some jokes now.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
When Travis said I just wanted to clean a sampling or whatever it was,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
he said I wasn't paying attention. What you gotta sample there was

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
the current Travis character, which is big time Travis.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Or my city Travis. So here's the thing, whenever we go

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
on a tour, and I don't have an explanation for this because it doesn't happen at the holidays

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
when they visit, whenever we go on a tour, we get a new Travis character.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
It's kind of like Doctor Who except played by the same actor every time.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
And usually the performance leaves something to be desired.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Here are some of the characters we have gotten

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
previously. One is Mordecai Travis, which is not

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Mordecai, the Johnny Depp character, but rather a character obsessed with the film

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Mordecai while lacking any sort of context or

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
insight into what the film might actually be about. So just basically

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
saying Mordecai a lot. No, it's this, based off the poster

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
what I think the movie is about. Yeah, it's a very fleshed out character. There's

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Big Snapple, who we only get in New York City, and again

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
sort of the depth of that character is, what if they called it the Big Snapple?

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
I asked for,

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
because I wanted a reprieve from big time Travis McElroy, I was like,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
please give me Big Snapple, and he said, no, that's a New York boy.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
You don't get him here. We did get a brief reprieve from big time

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Travis McElroy, who also is my city McElroy, so we

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
get a lot of, well that's how we do it in my city, San Diego, because he got here

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
a day before we did.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
The other one that we've gotten,

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
I don't know why we've gotten such a... I'll say this, we're ragging on him. I really like the

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
new character. The new character! And I don't know why we've got this fucking...

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
This is going to, I think, last me on tour, because it's maybe my favorite

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
thing I've ever done. We have this huge

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Noel Coward-esque cast of characters that Travis is dipping into

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
just for this one tour, and this one is

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
whenever there's a dessert or rich food offered, we have to deny it,

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
and then Travis has to say, oh come on, let's be bad. Just this once, let's be bad.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
He did it with

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
the cinnamon

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
bun I had at breakfast today. He did it at the, we've been to the bar,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
the pool bar at the Marriott twice. He did it with churros

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
both times there? Yeah. And he gets furious. The churros

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
showed up, and I reached over to grab one, and Travis said, no, no, no, no, no. And I was like, what the fuck are you...

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh, I really shouldn't eat these churros.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
He's going to go straight to my hips, and then... No, let's be bad.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Now what, Travis? Well, Travis, you can cut us off a slice. I want to drink the rest of the...

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
God, you know, we've got a show to do. I really shouldn't...

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Now...

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Listen, we've worked really hard this weekend.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Let's be bad.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Justin! I really think we've earned it.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Just this once. Just this once! I'm not done!

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
Okay. Just this once.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
This character... I'm not done! Please, please,

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
please be done. Let's be bad. And good.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
This character was born out of the fact that all of your meals here in San Diego when you go to a

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
restaurant are apparently just like, they bring them to your table and just

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
upend them out of a fucking duffel bag because it's the biggest fucking portion sizes

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
I've ever seen in my life. This is not a joke.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
We asked the waiter about it this morning, and he said, I don't get it either. Yeah, it's fucked up.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I usually order off the kid's menu is what he said.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Sorry that we got rolling a little late. I know you guys were outside

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
a little bit longer, so I'm sorry. I'm apologizing even though it wasn't my fault at all. Blame Mystery Science Theater

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
3000 for being too funny for too long.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
We're gonna do an intermission, which we've never done before, but we

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
realized there's a thing I guess they invented in the opera,

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
in the 16th century, where the opera singers would be like, man, I got pissed.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
So we're gonna do one of those, and then after that we're gonna

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
come back and do some Q&A stuff. Not Q&A, that's a fucked up way.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah, no. If you've ever wondered how we do our

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
thing, don't do that. Just be more show.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
It's not gonna be like a behind the scenes direct. It's just gonna be more of the show.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
The second half, you know, like intermission.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
But what that means is extra long, and it'll get a little weird in here, but

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
we're all... It's a safe place.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
During intermission there will be, if they're still out there, posters for sale

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
designed by Evan Palmer. They are fucking incredible.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Beautiful. They're really beautiful. They are also pre-signed, so

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
partake. Let's get into this shit.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I have really pointy elbows.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Previously this hasn't been a problem. Someone once thanked me for elbowing them in the face

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
by accident during San Diego Comic Con. But recently...

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Did someone thanked? I don't understand that. Thank? Yes!

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
You knocked it back into place.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Several events have made me reconsider the advantages of being able to elbow anyone out of my way.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I popped a friend's air mattress with just my elbow. Holy shit!

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
That's pretty serious. And my partner

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
will only cuddle with me conditionally out of fear that I'm going to make a wrong move

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
and make her double over in pain. Do you have any

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
suggestions as to how I can stop inadvertently causing my loved one's pain

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
and financial ruin from HER?

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
HER, are you here? Are you her?

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Hi! It's really dark. Hey, what's up? Okay.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
If you could just shout... Why did the person thank you for elbowing them?

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Oh, okay. So they weren't really thanking you

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
specifically for elbowing them in the face. I need to repeat what she said into the microphone

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
for the posterity.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
No, there's not. They were looking for the place where the ticket

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
was and you pointed them in the right direction with your elbow.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Can a dull elbow not accomplish that same task? Or check this out!

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
I got two of these!

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Did you really? Okay, I don't...

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Did you really? Wait, everyone stay out of this.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
This is just between me and her.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Did you really pop an air mattress with your elbow?

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
It was mine! Okay, yeah.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
We got evidence. The wronged party is here.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Did you like lay down and then turn over and then

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
did you wake up on a flat piece of plastic

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
and think not again?

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
These elbows?

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
And then you had the Incredible Hulk walk down the street hitchhiking.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
Are we talking like apocalypse style

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
bone spurs coming out of them? Yeah, I was about to ask if it's a jagged bone spur situation.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Sorry, we're asking you so many questions. You're sitting so far away.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
We just want to know if you're doomsday.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
People get that joke. He had bony elbows.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I mean, I'm sure there's some sort of

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
orthopedic surgery option, but that's not fun.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
And also, God doesn't make any mistakes. You got those elbows for a reason.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
You gotta Rudolph this shit.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
There's some sort of Rudolph scenario. Have you seen the movie?

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Won't you fucking stab a bunch of folks tonight?

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
What's gonna happen? David Tennant's trying to get through Comic Con.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
He's like, no one will make room. And you're like, I've got it, David.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Except you didn't because you got the surgery to get rid of them.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Have you ever seen the movie Signs? It's basically like that, except

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
you're gonna take all your glasses of water and throw them in the toilet.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
They're allergic to water. Fuck, I cleaned all those up.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
Where's my baseball bat? I don't know. I'm a grown man.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
It's in storage. I don't know where the baseball bat is.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
All the aliens look like big air mattresses. Fucking sweet.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
Aw, damn it. I had that surgery yesterday. I can't defend Earth.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Like Jesus wanted me to.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
God don't make ugly.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
We didn't say anything remotely helpful. Do you all want a yahoo, though?

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
I just saw

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
your t-shirt in the front row. Yeah, it says, they horny for this one.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
It's very, very good.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
This one was sent in by... Somebody yelled, we are!

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
This one was sent in by Level9000. Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Thank you, Drew. Oh.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Are you here, Drew? Just shout a big barbaric yell.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
I fucking...

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
I was just shaken by your fucking Fus Ro Dah all the way up.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Thank you, Drew. You are a champion and a scholar.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
It's by YahDrewAnswersUser... Oh, the website's not

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
loading. Very good.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
The something's gone wrong has popped up. I'll refresh it. That was a mistake.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
The data's gone. And it's back. Still not giving me the user's name.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Fine, fuck. Christian Bale. Christian Bale asks...

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
My parents found my bong?

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
I had a water bottle bong in one of my sports bags in my closet.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
And mom thinks that it is for drugs, but she's not sure.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
And it reeks of smoke. While my dad thinks it is

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
for an experiment I did or something.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
I plan on telling them that I planned on seeing how a leaves smell

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
by burning a leaf on the bong and smelling the smoke.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
I've never smoked in my life. Do you think I can get away with it?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm very paranoid of getting caught. I wonder why.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
You're bad at this. I'm very paranoid of getting caught and they haven't found

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
bud or lighter. I would say to this question asker, you don't have to be

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
paranoid about getting caught. You got caught. You got caught, it sounds like.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
How cool is this dad?

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
I think it's for drugs.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
I've never seen one of those before. That's an Erlenmeyer flask.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
As a parent myself, I can promise you

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
your parents will take whatever to get out of this situation.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
If you give them something in the same zip code as plausible

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
deniability, they're going to leap right on that. Oh, we don't have to parent this one.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
He was just burning leaves in a science experiment to see what they smelled

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
like. You know how when you're in science class and you burn

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
something and the science teacher is like... Now smell, huff that shit.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
Everybody, don't waft it you wuss. Get in there.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
First huff this shit. It's the control group. Now that one.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Science. How does that smell? Cool.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
That's science. You just did science. That's all it is.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
You know the experiment. What does it smell like? That's not a

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
scientific experiment. That's a creative writing prompt.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
You dullard.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Hi, it's me, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Did you do the experiment I told you about on television?

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
You know, if the entirety of human existence was a calendar,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
then point zero zero

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
zero one second to midnight is where you smell.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Oh, I didn't know you were doing Neil deGrasse Tyson there for a second. Okay.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
I didn't sound like Neil deGrasse Tyson. No, it was weird. You didn't.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Neil, are you here?

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
I can't hear Neil. Holy shit, he's here and there's eighteen

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
of them. It's our worst nightmare. Neil deGrasse Tyson

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
is cloning himself. How about another question?

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah. Hey boys. Hi.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
I've been cosplaying at conventions for years and a few cons

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
ago, an artist at a convention took a photo of me and asked

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
to do a painting of me based off of it. The resulting painting was

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
not so great. I'm reluctant to hang

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
it in my home, but I feel like I shouldn't get rid of it. Help?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
What do I do with this huge painting of me dressed in a silly

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
superhero outfit? And that's from Stacy. Stacy here.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Hi. Wait, are you a Cuvian throat singer?

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Why were there two?

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I just want to say, I heard when you said, took a picture, the acoustics

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
in here are fucking incredible because I heard when you said they took a picture and wanted to do a painting

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
of it, I heard one person two thousand feet away go, ugh.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
I did see today, I saw today on the convention floor

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
someone take a photo of someone else's

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
art piece and it was all I could do not to destroy that camera.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
Because the art piece,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
that's theft. It's just that one thing. The camera's pretty much getting it.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
Getting it. You got it. You got all the art in there.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
You should, let me help. This is an advice show.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Throw it in the trash can.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
No, no, no. Short sighted. Short sighted.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I watched many a sitcom. Okay.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
I just rewatched Seinfeld. Have you guys seen it?

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
It's pretty good. That was a very tepid response.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
Yeah. I cannot believe, by the way, IDW announced they're bringing it back

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
as a limited run here at Comic Con for eight issues. They're going to finish

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
a lot of the storylines that they left lingering. Are the pretzels making you thirsty?

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
They are. Yeah, they are. It turns out. Issue three. The crisis on infinite pretzels.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
I'm very excited for it. But here's what's going to happen. You throw that

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
away. Someone drives by. They see the painting. They're like, oh, it's pretty nice. And then they take it.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Then, 15 years from now, they get it appraised and hang it

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
in some kind of gallery. The artist sees it and like, where did you find this?

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
In the garbage. And they cry.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Or, I mean, by that point, having their work valued

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
highly would probably be... They'd probably be maybe a little stoked in this imaginary

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
situation you came up with. No, they painted that for you.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
It was a gift. I didn't want a bunch of people to see it and be worth money.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
You're bad at... Wait, hold on. I just had a huge realization.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
If an artist's painting sells for a bunch of money, the artist doesn't get that money.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
If I sell a painting I already own, I get that money.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
The artist is like, my painting sold for how much? Fuck! Damn it!

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Hey, artist, what the fuck?

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
You should keep getting money off of that. That sucks. I'm gonna work on that

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
for you and see what I can't come up with.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
I got some things cooking. So, Travis, your version of the

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Antiques Roadshow is you go to the Antiques Roadshow and say,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
listen, I had something and I don't now.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
What do you think that is worth?

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
That would be the best version. It already happens now.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
It's my favorite version of the Antiques Roadshow. They're like, I have this lamp.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
And it's like, did you polish this? I did.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Well, polish, it's worth $15. But with the patina,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
two million. Well, thank you.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
I would love it on one episode if they're like, and did you

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
do you have the gravy bowl that comes with it?

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh, actually I don't. I threw it out, didn't I? And then the

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Antiques Roadshow, the person just puts their head on the table and is like, Motherfucker!

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
Fuck!

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Fuck! And it's 15 minutes of that.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
And it just keeps cutting back to them. And it's a pledge drive.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
So that's not...

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Did you still have the dust cover to this?

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
No, when I bought it, I didn't have the dust cover. Oh, okay.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Son of a fucking

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
shit. That is all I've ever wanted from Great British Bake Off

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
is for Paul Hollywood to take a

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
bite of something and then look at the person and go, this tastes like dog shit.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
It's all I've ever wanted. All I've wanted is to watch

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
The Great British Bake Show and Mary Berry takes a bite of something and says, this tastes like dog shit.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, I want Antiques Roadshow, except the person's like,

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
I think it's worth $15,000, but who cares what I think? And then Mary Berry comes out and

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
takes a bite of the painting.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
It's a good bike, isn't it? You did really good.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
Wouldn't it be funny if the tent fell down?

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
What if Paul Hollywood just like,

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
farted? What are we doing? Why are people here?

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
I think you've got a future

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
at SNL, young man. How about this

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
Yahoo is sent in by Zoe Kinski. Thank you, Zoe Kinski.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
Zoe, are you here?

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
Okay, that would have been like a gathering of the stars that I was not

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
ready for. It's by Yahoo Answers user Katie, who

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
asks, Katie has 66% best answers. That's the highest fucking

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
Katie knows what's up. How to sneak pancakes

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
into a movie theater.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
My brother and I are going to see a movie on

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Friday morning, and we wanted to get IHOP.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
And then we thought it would be awesome to do both at once.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
But that means we'd have to sneak takeout in, and that's a full meal.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
Yep, we have a few ideas on how to do this,

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
but they mostly suck. So does anyone have ideas? That was not

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
my editorializing. And then a little smiley face at the end to let you

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
know, like, it's all fun.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Here's the thing. At this table, two of us

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
have had jobs at movie theaters.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
Justin, you worked at a movie theater once, didn't you? No, at Blockbuster, it's the movie theater

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
in your home. The rest of that sense was going to be, and across this table,

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
we have been fired twice from Blockbuster. But we've worked at

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
movie theaters twice, and I feel like the sneaking food in thing

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
is something that everybody's a little paranoid about,

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
that you couldn't be bothered less about. Yeah, I couldn't get less of his shit.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
You could walk into my movie theater with a pizza

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
and a growler, and I'd be like...

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
Wearing a sport coat made of the pizza you plan to eat during the movie.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
And I'd be like, you didn't have to, just go. Go.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Fine, yeah. Enjoy Sky High, I don't fucking care.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
Enjoy Sky High, just...

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
Some Sky High fans, good crowd for that, I guess.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Alright, so, just so I'm clear, fuck Seinfeld, but Sky High is...

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
Awesome.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
You've gotta get a top hat.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
And the thing is, you're gonna have to

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
stack some cakes. You're gonna do some cake stacking.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
In your hat. And then, that's easy. We've got the easy part solved.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
Cakes, pancakes. But then, you're gonna get the shi...

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Wait, you gotta do it dry. Gotta do it dry. Gotta do it dry, because you're gonna get those shitty plastic ramekins

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
that are designed to open. That are designed to open... How do you know so much about how the

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
IHOP fucking goes? How they IHOP-erate?

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
That's gonna be the hard thing is... Wait! No, that sucked, don't...

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
That was bad. IHOP-erate? I wanna hear stories of Justin's IHOP experience.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
So, what... You're just gonna have to dump the syrup

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
on and get a good seal going.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, wait! Straight up, freeze the syrup. Freeze the syrup.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Then warm it up in your hands in the movie.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
And then, listen, you're gonna be tempted to go too far, and then you'll

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
just have syrup on your hands, and that's gonna be tricky. This process, it's gonna

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
make a lot of noise, because you're gonna be in the theater just like...

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
And someone will turn around and say, like, can you please keep it down? It's fucking Despicable

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Me 3, and, like, my kids, can you please... And then you turn to them... I can't hear the

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
minions of the important dialogue. You turn to them, and what's great is you go...

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
And you look like a weird syrup monster, and no one fucks with that.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Wouldn't it be sweet if movie theaters finally started selling syrup warmers?

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
And they're just like, yeah, we get it.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
That'll be seven dollars.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
So you get a watertight, syrup-tight seal on your top hat.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
The problem is this, and I know you've all been thinking, but Justin,

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
wait. I've thought about it. When you go in, you see a

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
gentleman or a gentle lady, and they're gonna doff their cap to you.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
Ah, shit. And then it's like, am I gonna leave a

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
gentle bro hanging or not? Because if I open it...

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
Preserves. It's gonna be fucking compote.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
Compote sliding down your grill. That's no good.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
But you're not gonna leave a gentle person hanging. I gotta go for it.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
Gotta do it. That's how they get you. That's why they have a doffer at every entrance.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah. Ah!

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
You doff your hat. Runts. Just falling down your face. Bulk runts.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
It's...

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
I tried to explain to them, like, no, it's much cheaper

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
out there. They give you a lot of it for less money,

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
so I just did that. No, they're structural runs. Do you have

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
price matching? Because I'll do that here.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
I would watch this show, and it's just about the plight of a ticket taker,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
who anytime anybody comes in with like a unique garb,

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
a uniquely spacious garb, like some of the platform shoes, like,

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
all right, go on in, but I'm looking for fucking spaghetti

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
hanging out of those. The show's just called

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
It's Cool, I'm Stoned.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
They should have a bake car where a guy hands you

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
a box of Junior Mints outside. Hey, can you hold these for me?

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
It's for a friend. I left the... She's inside. Maybe just carry these inside.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
When I worked as security at a

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
big electronic retailing... It's Best Buy, why are you being real? Shut up!

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
I'm under an NDA!

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
I'm not. It's fine. They're cool.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
They understand. Taking a while to back into this Best Buy story.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
It's gonna be a good one, guys. Strap in. With this much build up?

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
One of the things that you had to do to arrest someone was prove that

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
they intended to leave without paying, so just because you

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
saw someone put it in their pocket, maybe they were gonna pull it back out and pay for it at the register.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
This is my payment pocket.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
I need these hands free!

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
I wanted to remind myself to buy it, so I put it here so I wouldn't forget.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
So one time, this person was stealing a bunch of stuff,

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
and they walked through the detectors and it beeped, and they looked at me

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
and I was like, you're cool! Travis!

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
Because if they didn't walk out the door, I wouldn't get the arrest!

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
What the fuck? Did you immediately go outside and tackle them?

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
No, the cops did that. That I had called.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
And prepared for this moment.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
You're on stage describing entrapment, and also...

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
Did you have a commission of just like...

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
No, but I did jump up and down so hard and, joy, I hurt my ankle.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
Because you got someone arrested?

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
This is confusing to me, because if you're in Best Buy Laws Prevention,

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
they have to leave the store before you can prove stealing, right?

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
You take one fucking step out of that

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
store, and you're nothing. Like, you don't have jurisdiction

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
outside the store, right? You have no power out there.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
So where is the horizon?

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
Hey, is this the police?

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
Be ready. No, you did 811. We get this all the time, though.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
Try again. This is Sketchers.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
Alright, Sketchers.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
Why is your phone number so fucking short?

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Wait, did you say Sketchers? Yeah, they're also at the mall.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
Oh, okay, got it. Thank you. Come along with me.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
Also, I don't think that's a thing. I don't think there's a Sketchers store at the mall.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
Wait, hold on. Oh, please, we gotta do more fucking questions

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
instead of talking about stores at the Huntington Mall.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
My partner... but did you hear the Payless and the Shoe Carnival merged?

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
Really? They're just one big fucking shoe carnival now.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
Get out. It's madness. That seems like a monopoly.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
I love any investment in the old girl. I'm just happy to see the dollars

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
at the Huntington Mall. Also, they expanded the dicks, so now it's a dicks

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
and a field and stream. Get the fuck out. I'm serious.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
Really? Did they have a pet store back? For a while,

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
they built an additional entrance to dicks because they were changing the other one

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
to field and stream, so for a while there were just two dicks there.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
This sucks so bad. What's at the Pied Piper now?

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
The Pied Piper, it's a US Army recruitment station.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Really? And there's some parallelism there if you want to get into the...

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Two pretzel places. Really?

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
Which one's better? One's a kiosk. Is that Excalibur?

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
What? Excalibur? Excalibur's still selling swords and Hummel figurines.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
Nice, nice, nice. Crushing it. They closed. I thought it'd be funnier.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
Did they rebuild the Caramel Corn store after it burned? Sorry? The Caramel Corn store?

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
Please, oh God, you had to say it twice. That's double...

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Caramel Corn store is now Dave's. They have Caramel Corn,

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
but also other things. You know, if Caramel Corn fought to diversify,

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
they might not have burned down. Let me get in on the bit, actually.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
I forgot we had a Caramel Corn store at the mall.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Not a restaurant, a retailer. I love it. How about another

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
fucking question?

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
That was the sound of relief.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
The Caramel Corn store at the mall was called Caramel Corn,

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
but they spelled it with K's. Okay, guys.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
Good try. Having fun with it. How about another question?

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
My partner and I both like dancing,

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
especially at parties. We wanted to up our wow factor, so we're thinking

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
of choreographing a full dance that we can whip out whenever

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
a certain song comes on. Go back to talking about the Huntington Mall.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
The question is,

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
what party song do we use?

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
And that's from Matilda. Matilda, I have some bad news. You've chosen the wrong question.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
We see this sometimes.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
I didn't know questions could be wrong.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
Are you here, Matilda? Yeah, sorry.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
No, that's fair.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
I'm thinking about the amount of effort that goes into

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
choreographing a dance that you can bust out at events.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
We all understand the impulse. Everyone wants to look like a dancing queen.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
We've all seen a goofy movie and thought that would be...

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
That's the dream. But at the same time, you work really hard

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
to master this dance. How many times can you do it before your friends

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
show up to a party and you're like,

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
do you want to funk on that thing? And they're like, fuck! God!

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Oh, good point, Griffin. So what you need to do,

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
choreograph a dance. That can work to any song? Do it to any song.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
Song comes on, yeah. This one.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
Do the chicken dance, but it's not the chicken dance. No, it's not.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
It's your own thing. It's a turkey dance. Matilda, you... It's not great.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
That's the best joke I had. Shit.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
Matilda, I'm not sure you should do this thing.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
I think that it would be pretty fun the first time, but I do think that there's going to be some

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
devaluing in repetition with this, where you'll feel very good

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
about it the first time, and honestly, the first time, people are going to fucking nut about it.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
They're going to be really stoked about it, and you'll feel stoked about it,

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
and then you'll be like, those McElroy idiots, they don't know anything. And then it's going to be

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
a funeral, or it's going to be...

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
The song's going to come on, and there's going to be a part of you that's like, this isn't appropriate.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
And then there's going to be another part of you where it's like, we did practice a lot.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
Seems like a shame to miss it. And this is maybe the only time

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
I'm ever going to be at a funeral where they're playing Uptown Funk.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
But the slow ballad version. The slow acoustic Uptown Funk.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
Uptown funk you up, I said Uptown funk you up.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
What if you pulled a move directly from 90s TV

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
and just yelled, do the Matilda!

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
And then just saw what everybody did, and whatever they did was down the Matilda.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
That's the dance, I like that. That's the Matilda, everybody going, hmm? That's the dance!

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
You know what else I like?

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
You get this dance going at a friend's wedding, steal the fucking spotlight, love that.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
Take that, Derek! And then...

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
You fucking pack your bags, you move away. I'm talking about

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
you are now living an Incredible Hulk Pretender-esque lifestyle

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
where it's just like, hey, yeah, I just moved here to Milwaukee, I need some new friends.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
You spend like a month ingratiating yourself, getting invited to that new party,

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
and then you're like, is this Uptown Funk?

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
You folk it up. No, it's Garth Brooks' The Dance, and we've told you

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
that several times. And then it's like, where did Matilda go? Ah, moved to Phoenix.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
Had work there.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
Let me suggest this. They play Uptown Funk.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Natural.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
You dance to it bad. Oh, no.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
Everyone's like, mmm, mmm, and move. I thought they practiced this, that wasn't very good.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
Yeah, this is bad, right? And then you turn to the DJ and you go, you know what?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
Give us one more shot.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Play Uptown Funk twice in a row!

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
And then the DJ...

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
The DJ sees something in your eyes.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
And he goes, you know what? Gotta give him a shot.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
And he plays that again, and everyone's like, didn't we just play this?

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
Is he okay?

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
But then they see you swing dance to it, which is of course the best dancing.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
To Uptown Funk, it's the best dancing

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
you can do is an old-timey swing dance. It fits to any song.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
Sure. Have you not seen swing dance?

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
How about a Yahoo?

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
This one was sent in by Level 9000. Yajur Juju, do you have it in port? Thank you, Juju.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
It's from Yajur Answers Users.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
Oh, this is 200th one!

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah!

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Can we get a little bit of house lights, please? Can we get the house lights up, please?

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Can we get house lights up, please? House lights.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
A little bit. If that's possible, house lights. House lights.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
One sec. House lights.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Drew Davenport!

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Drew Davenport!

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Alright, now back to us. Now let's do it.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Hey, wait a minute. Drew's dead. It's our show now.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Let's do the question. Wait a minute, this one's super racist. Drew!

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
Drew, you milkshake ducked us.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
This one's asked by Yajur Answers User, Sarah W,

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
who asks, does Batman eat or drink while he is Batman, or does

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
he wait until he is Bruce Wayne?

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
I think...

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
Travis is laughing for a very specific reason that we'll get into in a second.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
I think that Batman is in costume so long sometimes that he must at least drink water

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
to keep himself hydrated. But my friend thinks that there must be

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
a hydration IV in Batman's utility belt. Not fucking Dune!

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
That makes a lot... Not in a Freeman suit!

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
That makes a lot of sense. Batman doesn't know how long he's going to be hiding up there

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
when he's in the rafters or what have you.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
So he just wants the hydration built in and a catheter, we must assume.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
My favorite Batman series is Batman

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
The Catheter is Assumed. It only ran for a few

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
issues. It was soundly rejected by critics, but it meant

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
something to me, damn it. Here's why I'm laughing. When Griffin and I

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
were walking to the Avengers Zone show yesterday, we saw a guy

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
in a full Christian Bale Batman

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
Dark Knight Batman ordering some

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
food. He was still wearing the

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
cowl and everything. And then we had a lot of fun

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
with the rest of our walk of just like, are the samosas particularly spicy?

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
How spicy are the samosas?

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Is the non-dairy free?

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
This is fun.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
I would actually love to like, I don't know how we do this, but I would love to hear

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
from the audience about my favorite, this is my first time at Comic Con

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
and it's been, thank you, thank you. I don't know why I'm thanking you

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
I came to a show, I did a thing.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
The best part, other than watching Justin's face

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
as he is slowly consumed by a mob of people

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
racing to meet the cast of The Flash. Quick side note, I was trying

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
to cross the fucking floor and I hear, is anybody out there

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
like The Flash? The answer from everyone on Earth was

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
yeah. And then I hear, welcome to the stage, the cast of The Flash

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
and I look up and just like a fucking omen of death, there's

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
John Wesley Shipp just staring back at me. It might also have been Grant Gustin

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
I have a hard time telling them a part that looks so similar to their father and son. And they're

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
looking down at me and I realize, oh God.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
I can see them so good. And then I turn around

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
and it's just like this mob of iPhones raised high in the air

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
squishing me and my dad as we try to get

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
away from the show floor and get out of there and we were almost killed

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
by this horde of people trying to see the cast of this show.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
I'm sorry, does it have to stop you? No, Travis, you don't because I'm going to be

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
the first to say flash mob out loud. No, no, no.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
No, I'm sorry. Our dad has just texted us. Our dad

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
has just texted us mid show. I saw a Golden Age Flash

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
riding on one of those pedal thingies yesterday. That's very good.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Golden Age Flash in a pedigab is funny on a lot of different levels. But this is what, this is

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
my favorite thing of Comic Con is cosplay people

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
as characters doing mundane things that it is so inappropriate.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
And this is all time, maybe funniest thing I've ever fucking

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
seen in my whole life. And I feel uncomfortable conjuring the specter of this

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
scene here during this live show because it's going to be funnier than anything that we could possibly say.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
When we were at the Marriott pool bar the other day, I

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
was walking outside and I passed by a table

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
and there was Dumbledore and he was

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
eating out of a styrofoam to go box some buffalo wings.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
We saw

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
Pepsi Man peeing in a urinal.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
We saw Pepsi Man piss in the bathroom. We got here

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
day one, we're like let's go to the bathroom before we get into it and there was fucking

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Pepsi Man just like pissing.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
That's become my new favorite thing to see these really intricate cosplays.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Like that's great. And then the first, if they walk in the bathroom they have to go, fuck.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
If you've got a really good one. Can we get house lights?

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
House lights for a second. If you've got a really good one. Cosplay character doing an awesome

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
mundane thing. Yeah, it has to be superhero doing a mundane thing, two it has to be

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
real, if you lie we'll know, and three it has to be short. If you have something

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
fitting that description. Not as many takers as I thought there would be for this. We have microphones

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
somewhere, right? You can also just shout it, I don't think the mics are out just yet.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Okay, hold on, wait, I'm just going to, right here.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
That's pretty good. You had to put your cape over your shoulder when you went to the restroom.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
I felt weird repeating that, but.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
That's fine. Right there in the back.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
Oh shit.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Hold on, we have to repeat these things into the microphone. Griffin, what did he see?

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
You saw a guy dressed as Sasuke from Naruto get arrested.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Now I will say this,

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
I've never been arrested and taken to jail, but if I was,

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
I would love to be dressed up like a Naruto character.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
I saw last night walking down the street

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
with my friends Paul and Storm, I saw a superhero

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
bunched up vomiting.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
And I saw a lot of other superheroes walk by without helping.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
This is specifically what Uncle Ben was

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
talking about. This is my favorite parable, Jesus, thank you for sharing it with me.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
Right here.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
Hold on, I'm pointing at this person. We'll do the balcony in a second.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
Saw Batman petting a ferret.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
Dr. Manhattan eating a hot dog.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
You fucking teleported to Jupiter, what are you doing?

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
Princess Belle complaining about her boyfriend on a cell phone.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
Right there, I'm looking, yes.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
Yes, you and then the person who's right next to you. You first.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
You're standing up. You're doing it.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
A Power Ranger with a cell phone in his crotch.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
When they did that, did the fucking Megazord show up?

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
Oh.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
Excellent, right behind you.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
Drunk Naruto barfing down the front just like Naruto does.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
I've never seen Naruto.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
I saw a Harley Quinn and the Joker

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
that she was with calling her mom to be picked up.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
That's extremely good.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
I'm like a dog chasing my mom's car.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught it.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
I'd get in her midsize sedan

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
and I'd go back to dad's house

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
because it's every other weekend.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Yes, stand up.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Be cool.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
Get the fuck right out.

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
PETA called the cops on the furry convention?

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
That doesn't fit within the context of our thing, but I very much appreciate this.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
Hold on, wait. Time out. I'm sensing there's more.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
Yeah, the LAPD officer.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
That's what I expected. There's a cop going, and what do I...

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
And who do I arrest?

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
I can't arrest a fucking dog.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
Yo, yo, yo. Furries can do infinite crime.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
This guy's holding my fucking plasma screen television

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
that he just took out of my house. What are you talking about? That's a big dog.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Wasting my time. That's a panda.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
Should we... Yeah, let's call it for now. Thank you all very much for your fun stories.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
We're going to go take an intermission and then we'll be back and we'll do some audience stuff.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
We'll be right back. Alright, we'll be right back. Thank you.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Do you think they can hear that airplane? Maybe.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
We're sleeping on the tarmac tonight. We're having a tarmac campout here in Los Angeles at the beautiful

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
Los Angeles X Airport. I don't know why they call it that.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
Hey, I want to call it the LA Airport. Put an X on there.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
Yeah, it makes it better. All the kids are in the X games right now. It's a very hot airport.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
Thanks for listening to the live show that we just did. Where?

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Here in San Diego. Here in California.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
Yeah, here on the West Coast. But up on it from where we are now at the beautiful Lox Airport.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
I know. I'm too busy to do stuff with

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
my hands. I just got these two ears. I don't know why I'm doing this voice.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
Yes. Good. No you don't understand.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
I'm in love with Mr. Potter. Do you love Mr. Potter? Then you should check

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
out your wizard Harry. Oh there's another airplane.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
Don't get caught up in the jets of it. It's a Harry Potter

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
podcast where friends recap the books and discuss everything Harry Potter.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
Currently they are on Prisoner of Azkaban. If you love

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
drama you won't want to miss the trivia rounds during which the hosts

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
vie for the Quizzich cup. Oh nice. Nice.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
And generally get mad at each other. If you want to find it.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
I hope it's not too serious. They keep alight. You know them.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
You can search for your wizard Harry on iTunes

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
or you can go to geeklyinc.com

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
to find out more. I love by the way Justin's impression

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
of Gary Sinise doing an impression of Hagrid.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
I was going to say Rip Torn doing an impression of Hagrid. It's much more Gary Sinise.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
I have a personal Jumbotron message. This one's for Morgan and it's from

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
Andrew Jose or Jose who says

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
since I have no idea when this message will be up we'll combine all of the

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
2017 things it can possibly hit. Congrats on getting into grad school.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
I hope. What a cold shot there Andrew Jose. Although I'm sure

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
Morgan pulled it off. Happy birthday. Good luck at

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
Camp Hollywood and ILHC and Merry Christmas. But above

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
all I hope this message finds you full of happiness. Love Andrew.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
I like that intern there Andrew. You know what but you know what really matters?

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
The friends we made along the way. We have some very

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
important things that we need you to know about. First Monday night

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
we are on an episode of At Midnight with Chris Hardwick. Earlier today we can say that.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Well when you listen to this last night. If we sound loosey goosey we're coming down

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
off that being on TV the national television for the first time stress.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
But you should go check it out on the Comedy Central website

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
and if you like it tell other people to watch it.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
Other stuff. Can we talk about? Yeah we should.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
We're doing live shows. This fall we're doing a lot of live shows.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
All over. Yeah so basically

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
we are going to be putting tickets on sale this Friday

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
at noon local time to the different locations. We are going

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
Then October we're coming down south. October 20th

we're going to be at the Cobb Energy Theater I guess. Is that a field?

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
Cobb Energy. Sounds serious. That's in Atlanta Georgia and then

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
on the 21st we're going to be doing MBMBAM in Nashville at Andrew Jackson

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000

You can guess what city that's in. The Orpheum Theater

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
in Minneapolis on November 18th and the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee on

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
November 19th. And to finish up along

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
in conjunction I would say in the time schedule with

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
PodCon in December we will be doing an Adventure Zone

If you live in one of those cities or you want to get there for one of those shows

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
we have no quality control we could possibly do

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
with any of these things. So be online and ready to buy tickets

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
ahead of time and may the odds be ever in your favor.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
I hope everything goes well but it's kind of

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
way beyond our pay grade. We're going to have links to all these

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
Good luck and we love you and

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
please come out and tell everybody because they're big shows and

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
we haven't been to some of these places before at all so we just want to make sure to see everybody

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000

I want a munch! What?

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
I want to munch! What?

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
Welcome everybody to Munch Squad.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
It's a show within a show.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
Normally the podcast is just my brother, my brother and me but today

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
it's the Munch Squad.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
This is like the tenth time you've done Munch Squad.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
It was not a good transition.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
Thanks Dad.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
Today's Munch Squad was submitted to us by one Sydney McElroy.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
It's funny.

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
She doesn't care for my brother, my brother and me so much. Huge Munch Squad

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
fan. Deep in the squad.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
Whoever makes those Munch Squad only YouTube cuts, Sydney sure appreciates

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
that. Applebee's has introduced a new

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
topped and loaded menu. Wait, Applebee's?

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
Eating good in the neighborhood? That's the one except

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
it's not that. It's eating bad in the neighbor sad.

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
Thanks.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
Okay, the thing I enjoy about the topped and loaded menu

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
is that as I say the words to you, it's going

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
to sound normal and then your brain is going to start processing

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
it and you're going to realize that that is not the case.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
Applebee's Neighborhood Grill and Bar today unveils Topped and Loaded, a limited time

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
lineup of craveable, customizable entrees.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
Starting at only $10.99 at participating restaurants, the topped and loaded menu features

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
four protein choices. Let me just say, so appetizing.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
Three delicious toppers and four side options.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
Giving guests an abundance of mouth watering combinations to choose

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
from. Guests are invited to explore a variety of options

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
and build their perfect meal.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
If this is your perfect meal, please.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
My last meal, I want it to be topped and loaded.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
Let's be bad.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
Do you want dessert?

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Well, we did kill 18 people. I was very bad when I did all the murders

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
and I'm going to continue being bad. Top and load that shit.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
It says they can build their perfect meal

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
with these three simple steps. Oh, boy. You know you got a real

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
hit on your hands when there's a flow chart for your dinner.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
So you start with your protein base. It says that.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Like, soylent. Like, start with

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
A, chicken breast. B, bone-in pork chop. Nice.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
Oh, it's bone-in. Never mind.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
Six ounce USDA Choicetop Soreloin or

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
eight ounce USDA Choicetop Soreloin. All right.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
I don't know how my hunger differentiates between the exact same

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
six or eight ounce steak, but here we go. You know what?

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
I'm hungry, but I'm only three quarters

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
as hungry as I might be. Actually, can you shave

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
one ounce off the eight? Because I feel like a seven. I'm seven

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
ounce hungry. You got to pour the eight into the six ounce and what's left?

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
My heart puzzle. Excuse me. I saw you shave one ounce off of his steak.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
I want a seven by order of six. Can I have his ounce? So we all have

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
sevens. Then you're going to pick your topper on your

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
protein, and here are the options. See? The Cajun

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
shrimp topper, which includes blackened shrimp, salted onions, and savory lemon

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
butter. I feel kind of bad for shrimp that it didn't make the protein base

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
cut. Bacon, beer, cheese

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
topper. That's made of Blue Moon white cheddar cheese

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
beer cheese, spared. No expense. This is just called the goodbye option.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
Nah, that one's next.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
Bacon, crispy onions, and fresh green onions. Hey Applebee's,

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
I trust you to put something fresh on my top that loaded about as far

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
as I can throw you, but thank you. It's very sweet of you to write.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
And finally, the marinara mozzarella

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
stick topper. And then it says, the

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
next part of the sentence is consisting of, and it's like, yeah, I fucking get it.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
You fucking assholes. I know what you're

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
doing. Crispy mozzarella sticks, classic

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
marinara sauce, and a parmesan cream sauce.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
What the fuck?

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
How do you get a steak, and you put mozzarella

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
sticks on it, and then you put marinara on it, and someone's like,

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
there's something missing.

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
I could do more. Here's the thing, I am not above

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
ordering mozzarella sticks as an

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
appetizer, and then a steak

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
as the dinner, but if the server tripped,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and dropped

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
the app plate on the steak plate,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I would say, redo that.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Try again. This isn't fine.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I have to ask a question of this character. Is there a

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
limit to Let's Be Bad, where

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
they put mozzarella sticks on a steak, and then they put marinara sauce on

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
the sticks, and then they put a fucking parmesan cream sauce

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
on top of the other sauce? Well, Let's Be Bad, see that, and say like...

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Well, here's the... Nobody's that

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
bad. It's the difference between Let's Be Bad, and Let's Fuck Up.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
But what does Applebee's have to say for themselves? We're sorry.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
We're so, so sorry. Our topped and loaded

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
menu gives guests what they've always wanted.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
If they really admit it. Look within yourself.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It gives our guests what they've always wanted. A cheap and easy death.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
A swift, painful passing

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
from this thing they call mortality. A mozzarella

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
escape. A mozzarella mortality escape. To show up

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
in front of St. Peter's, Pearly Gates, and have him say, you look like shit.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Did he do the parmesan sauce?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Jesus! You smell like ass. You gave them the porn, you're going to hell. I hate

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
this. Give them what they've always

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
wanted. The chance to top one favorite with another

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
to discover a creative and tasty spin on a

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
classic. Hey, how's your fucking bucket list going? Pretty bad, it seems.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Just the one item on there. The one thing you've always wanted

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
is to put mozzarella sticks on an Applebee's steak, and then marinara sauce and cream

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
sauce? Fuck off. The steak's pretty good, but what

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
bums me out is it stops here. But what

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
if it stopped here? Thomas

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Yoon, the executive chef of Applebee's, says I quit.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I'm done. This is it. I knew you would push me

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
too far at some point, and this is it. I've never quit in a press

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
release before, but... No, I love Thomas.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
He's my new guy. He gets audacious here. For example,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
pairing the chicken breast with the marinara mozzarella stick topper

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
with the parmesan cream sauce is a deconstructed and reinvented

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
chicken parmesan.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Okay, is that sentence...

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Are there a weird string of capitalized letters

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
in there where it's perhaps a secret message like, they've got me trapped

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
in the bunker.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Please send help. Please send broccoli

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
or celery at this point.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
You want me to brand it? No, please.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And reinvented chicken parmesan that satisfies and delights the taste buds

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
in a way that is uniquely Applebee's. Thomas Yoon

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
on this, we can't agree.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Jesus!

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That was the worst

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Sonic experience I've ever had. I am legitimately sorry. I got a little

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
choked. Let's do audience questions. Can we get lights up?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So don't come down just yet. We'll just raise your hand

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and we'll call you up, sort of Price is Right style. Hold on. Before we call anybody.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
We have one rule. You know what it is.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Okay, now you might hear that and think, okay, but mine...

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
No. Yeah, not just one.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And if you start it with, I know this sounds like a bummer, but no.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Let's just work our way across and then

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
balcony, I'm sorry, we have nothing for you. If you've got a really good one,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
come down to the lobby and just listen. Yeah, I guess so. Alright, left side.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
What's up? Nothing, I guess.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Yeah, no, that person who was getting pointed at by another person with a sword.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yes, yes. The only person in that whole section with their hand up.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Yeah, the first person who said, yes, you're good. Come on down. Yes.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It continues to be you. I fucking love...

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
This is the only show we've ever done where Travis said the person with the sword pointing at somebody

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
else and there were like six people, like, nice.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It's down here. It's down here. It's down here. Can we get a little bit more

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
speakers? Hi. Hello. Hi.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Hey, what's your name? Jerrick. Hi, we've met you at the booth at the signing thing.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Hi. Hi. How's it going? Not bad. Are you having fun at the con

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
or have you seen? You guys. Okay, good. Fair. What's your question,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Jerrick? Sounds like a pretty shitty con so far. Hey, I

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
was emotional. Okay. So, I have this thing

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
where multiple times

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
random people that I've never met before, they think they know me

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
and they'll go, oh, start waving or like, I think I

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
remember you from somewhere. And some of them are so excited to see me,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
they go up and give me a hug. Oh, okay. And then when they pull away, they

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
see my frightened face. And then they're like,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I thought I knew you. What's the best way of

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
diffusing the situation? God. Where are you at that that's happening?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I'll hug, but I'm not gonna look at your face first.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It's happened at like school and Comic Con and just when I'm

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
out at... Jerrick, I live with social

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
anxiety, which the main way it manifests is like, I don't know what to

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
fucking say to people, especially meeting new people. I have no idea. Maybe you should

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
stop looking this incredible gift in the mouth. Like,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
or gift horse rather. That's the expression. Don't look a gift in the mouth. Don't look a gift in the mouth.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
This person has come up and hugged you.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I think you got a friendship burn right there. Yeah, it's way better rather than your frightened face

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
if they pull back and you're going...

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I don't know you. Well, just stare them dead in the eyes and be like, welcome

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
aboard. Shall we exchange

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
contact info? It may seem you've gotten on the wrong train now,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
but look around you. Maybe it's the perfect...

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I see you've met my...

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I think just lean into it and make a new friend. Do lean into the hug.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Push them down. Yeah, what do you do with the hug? Because a hug is a two person thing usually,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
unless it's bad. Do you return it? Well, I try and

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
kind of be like, yeah, we're friends, but it's like...

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
That's good of you. Yeah, that's very kind. That's very sweet, Jerrick. I just don't want to give it

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
too much of a, oh yeah, we're definitely this close. Don't be the first

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
one to break that contact. Yeah, and I like how you leave a little mystery in there.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
That's nice. We were at a party earlier today and

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I was getting up to leave and go to the hotel and I was sitting at a table

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
and some dude came in and took my seat.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I guess Dad was also about to leave and he leaned over

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
this gentleman and then caught himself and then saw me standing

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
up and said, oh, I was just about to kiss this man on the head

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
because I was leaving. And the man, the

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
gentleman was a bald gentleman and so I kind of think Dad just wanted

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
to kiss a stranger on the... He just saw a very nice looking

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
head and was like, oh, don't mind if I...

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So it could be much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
worse is what I'm saying. So is it possible that there's someone out in the world

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
impersonating you? Oh, shit. I've

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
never expected that. Jerrica-like. Or worse,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
maybe it's you.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Memento!

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Anyway, you got memento disease. Sorry about that.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Sorry, glad we can help. It turned out okay for them in the movie. I think I've

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
seen it a long time. I can't remember how it ends. Anyway, does that help?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Definitely. Cool. Thank you.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Yeah.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Yes, you.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I always get so uncomfortable because

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
sometimes I think people are cosplaying as Angus McDonald, but then that could

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
just be your fashion. And if that's the case, like fucking cool. That is my favorite Comic Con game.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Cosplay or weird fashion choice? Not weird. No, hey, come on. Bold.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Sorry, bold. Okay. Hello, sirs.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
That's it.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
What's your name? Hi, I'm Alexi from Oxnard. Hi. Hello. One more

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
time, sorry. Everybody was talking. Everyone, please. One second.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
My name's Alexi. It's Russian, but I'm Mexican. I have really weird parents.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
But you did clarify you're from Oxnard, correct? Yeah. Okay.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
What is your question? So I think I have a

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
terrific fun on stage experience when it comes to other people, but I have no

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
capabilities of like doing improv or anything alone.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And I've wanted to be a stand-up comedian all my life. And you guys have done

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
community theater and everything. Sure. I've done none of that. And I want to see if you have any advice

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
for... Okay, wait. Stop. Turn the microphone around.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
That's good.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
All right.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
This is great. What I love about this is the first time you

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
do stand-up comedy, you're going to fail, right? It's why

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I've never done it once. Nice try, God.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You'll never catch me. Here's what we're going to do. I want you... Oh, shit. Don't

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
do this. No, trap, trap, trap. No, no. Hear me out. Allow me to fail, Griffin.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Hear me out. Say the first thing that pops in your head and everybody boo

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Alexi. No, don't boo Alexi. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me. This is nothing.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Trust me. Do it. Say it. Say it. Whatever.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
How about airplane food? Am I right?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
God. I don't like it either. All right. All right. Now you got that

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
out of the way. Now say the first thing that comes to mind. Everybody laugh your

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
fucking faces off. I love traffic.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
That's very good. Just like that. You're on the upswing. Yeah.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Look at that. Now that you've gotten rid of the yips, I'm going to give you

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
a tight one. Just a one-minute set. Oh, boy. This is not

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
what I prepared for. Alexi, no help is coming. Oh, my God.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Oh, God. This is going to be a long

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
60 seconds, but I swan to John. I'm not saying a word.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Okay? So you got to hang in there. Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Before we start, Alexi, I'm going to offer you a ripcord. Yeah.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
You have the chance. You can put the mic back. Horrible thing. Hell yeah. That's my dude.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
How's everyone doing tonight?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Justin was walking you on. Hold on. Are you trying to hog my spotlight right now?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I was going to get you on. Hold on one second. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Alexi.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Okay. And go.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
All right. So everyone's enjoying Comic Con. Pretty good, right? Pretty good.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I'm a cosplayer myself, and I've done a few things and stuff.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The worst experience I've had doing that, though, is I was a little Robin cosplayer.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
I had little tights on and everything. It was fantastic. And then I got diarrhea.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
for the last half of the con, I shoved toilet paper down the back of my pants.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And I really just refused to stand

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
up anywhere, but I got tons of kids asking me to take pictures with them.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Boy, was it hard to look a kid in the face and go,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
No. I'm not doing that. I really

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
can't, because there's doodle up in this little thing.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So I try not to cosplay anymore.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Ten seconds. Bring it home. Unless I got underwear on. And let me tell you, me undies is a

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
great sponsor. Fuck me right now. And they're great. Aren't they

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
fantastic? Okay, Alexi. Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Alexi. Alexi.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Thank you.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Here's twenty dollars.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Ladies and gentlemen. Okay, no. We'll just keep the twenty dollars.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Congratulations. Alexi is now a professional stand up comedian. Thank you.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Fantastic.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
That's the most we've ever helped someone ever

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
fix the whole thing. Thanks, Alexi.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The whole gesture. You gotta take the fucking money.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Take a picture with me after the show.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Okay.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
No, you don't get to give it to Alexi.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
He's a good guy. He's a good guy.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
It's his money. He can do what he wants with it.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Let's go a little bit further back.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
There's somebody jumping up and down in the aisles. Yep, jumping up and down. Way on the way back.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Yes. You got it.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Yeah, it's you.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
You can stop pointing at your face. I promise, it's you.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Still me? I promise. Hi. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
We were pointing. Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
This is awkward. What's your name? Nine, like the number. Hi, Nine.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
How you doing? I'm good. Cool. What's your question? Is that a members only jacket?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
What? It's a sweet jacket. I like it. A DuckTales shirt, too. That's choice.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Okay. Hi. So I've been collecting

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
toys, action figures, and plushies since I was

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
in high school. I have a pretty substantial collection right

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
now. But the thing is that I have a niece now who comes to visit me a lot.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
She's really little and she always wants to touch everything.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
But right now, she knows pretty much like, you know, I have like some stuff and I'm like, no,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
not that stuff. But what I'm worried about is when she grows up, she's going to be like,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
well, why can't I play with those toys? And I'm going to have to tell her,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
you know, those are my grown up toys.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I'm new to this whole taking care of a kid

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
thing. Don't use the phrase grown up toys.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
It will not go out.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I'm so torn because part of me wants to be like, I mean,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
there's like fucking movie, the fucking Toy Story 2 mode, just like, toys are supposed to be played with.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Take them out of the box. But at the same time, like,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
that's... I guarantee my like Harry Houdini action figure

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
is like, I'm fine. I'm good. Please don't let your baby gum on me.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
That's a mech I built for two weeks from Neon Genesis Evangelion.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You don't know how to play with that. You would be bad at playing with that.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
You're not ready to play with that. The thing is that I do,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I have been buying like more like toys that she can play with because like I do want to

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
like share that kind of stuff. You just put those low. You put the good ones high.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Yeah, let's be real. You bought those to keep her away from the

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
goods. The premium toys.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Yeah, so I was just wondering how I'm supposed to have

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
that conversation with her. All you have to do is like make a bright

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
light and a child.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Travis, you're giving some fucking like My Cat From Hell Jackson Galaxy shit.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Give her shelves that she can play with. But then you have

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
your adult shelves with your adult toys. Just look the

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
kids in the eye and say, that one's made of knives.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I know it doesn't look like it's made of knives, but there's knives all

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
through it. Actually with a lot of those Evangelion mechs, it's actually probably

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
not too far off. That's true. Knife Dad.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Knife Dad is a beloved. Please don't reference things I'm not on.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
It's just a knife thing. Travis hates it when we talk about Monster Factory.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
It's just not my IP. Okay, has there been, let me ask you

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
this. Has there been an infraction?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
You mean like has something gotten like broken or what? Yes. Something almost did

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
and it was really hard to find because I got really nervous. What was it? There's like this little

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
piece that was attached to one of the toys and she was messing with it

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
and it came off and I was looking everywhere because I had carpet in my room and I couldn't find it and I was freaking out.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
But I found it, so it was okay.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
You had me on tenterhooks.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It was pretty touch and go there for a while. How about you just like

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
don't let her in your house. Maybe it's more of

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
an outside kid, you know?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I got you some

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
sidewalk chalks. Have fun. There's a bubble

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
mower. Get out of my face. I gotta put together

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
this zord. Is that still a thing people do?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Yeah, they build zords. You know, it's

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
does that help? Yeah, a little.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Thank you. Thank you.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
We're probably going to do like one or two more

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
because it's almost tomorrow. Right there with both of your hands. Stand up and

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I'll tell you if it's you. Yes, it's you. Come on down. No.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
No, no, no. Grey shirt. Grey shirt.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
We're pointing at three different fucking people. You. Yes. Grey shirt.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Come on out. Yes. No. We'll do both. No, you're next.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
You're next. You're next. You're next. There has to be

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
a better way to do this. Everyone please get a number

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
like at an auction. All right. You're next. You're in the

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
batter's plate.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
You're on deck. You're in the batter's plate. Hi. Hi.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
What's your name? Morgan. Hi, Morgan. What's your question?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
So I just graduated from college. Cool. Congratulations.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It's our show, okay?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Hey, come on. What was your degree?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Biology. Nice.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
So like science. Couldn't have majored in something funny for us.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Rubber chickens and farts? It was a double major.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
In rubber chickens and farts. I majored in the water bottle flip.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Oh, nice. No, so my dad got me these

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
for my graduation gift, these like 12 little wind-up Jesuses.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And I don't know why.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And I don't know. Let Morgan finish.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
And he just like sat there with this really triumphant look on his face like it was like

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
some inside joke that we have and it wasn't. So I don't.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Now I just have one fell out of my bag earlier at a 7-Eleven. It was really awkward.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
All right. Follow up question. Been holding those G's eye all night?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Yeah. I brought three for you guys because then I only

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
have nine to deal with. Hell yeah. Are these your fucking horcruxes?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Oh wait, they do fun stuff. They do backflips.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Well, after he gave them to me, he stared at me for a minute and then he went

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
they don't walk on water and then he just sat there. Oh, man.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Mine's broken. Oh, no. I got a bum Jesus.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Okay. First things

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
first. The sound is awful. Yeah. No.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Apologies to the woman sitting in front of us. You just gave away a fourth of

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
these and you're a sucker because these are awesome.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Thank you very much. You're welcome. God, that's a weird pull

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
from your dad though, for real. Can I tell you? Here's my theory.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
This is what I would do. Okay.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I can't think of a good gift. I wish I could think of an inside joke gift.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Oh, you know what would be funny? If I pretend like it's an inside

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
joke but I just have some shit someone else gave me.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I want to flash forward 15 years to the episode of Antiques Roadshow where they're like

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
if only I had all 12 wind up Jesuses.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
You have nine? What happened to the other three?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
If you look on the foot, you can see that these are

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
cast by Jesus himself.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
He was a carpenter. Do you remember

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Morgan, do you remember the first words out of your

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Come on. I'll put them next to this mic.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I'm getting it in the monitor and it's hell on earth.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Do you remember the first words you said to him after he handed you

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
12 Jesuses? Did he maybe read the Bible really

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
fast and think, okay, 12 Jesuses, yeah, I get it. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Take these toys, they are my tiny selves.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Actually, the first thing I think I did was put it

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
in my mouth and then I did a Griffin's amiibo. Oh, good.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
That's pretty good. And I'm sure everyone there

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
was like, oh, I love that franchise. Oh, I get it.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I definitely get that one. Actually, I think pretty much everyone there is. Oh, you have

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
cool friends. Thank you for the Jesuses and I

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
hope we helped in some degree.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Alright, this will probably be the last one because it's now Sunday.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Oh, that's his

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
day.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Hey, how's it going? Happy Sunday. Hey, thank you. Same to you. First, Justin,

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
were you at Comedy Bang Bang two days ago? No. Saw a guy

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
that looked like you and I was too scared to say anything. That was Dustin. Really glad you

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
didn't say hi. He was kind of a dick, so that

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
sounds like a Dustin thing. Shoot, it might have been me now that I think about it. What is your name?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
What's your name? Alright. What was that? What's your name? James. James, hi.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Hi, Amanda. James, why do you have... Hi, Amanda. It does say

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Idaho on your shirt. I am Idaho. My girlfriend and I

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
are cosplaying... As states. No, Lisa and Ralph

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
from The Simpsons. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Now I get it. We were doing Simpsons Trivia

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
earlier and we won. Hey, congrats. And we won best costumes.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
So, there we go. Alright, my question. Is it Simpsons Trivia?

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Because I'll fucking tank. What's the name of

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
the ice cream shop in Springfield? I have no fucking idea. Is this real? No, it's

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
real. Phineas Cube Butter Fats Old Time Confectionary. I would ask the audience, but I'm afraid

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
the building would explode. So, what's your question?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Wait, what's the ice cream shop? Phineas Cube Butter Fats

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Old Time Confectionary. Cool.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
That was a question? It means nothing. I'm assuming that's for one of the later seasons.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It's early, it's early. Alright, so for my job

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I have to plan a donor party. Okay. And

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
it just so happened to be planned that it was going to be the day before my birthday. So, I jokingly

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
included a birthday cake in the catering and the budget

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
and got it all approved. Oh, no. So, wait, I'm going to stop you

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
right there. You can't jokingly do something

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
and then... Yeah, let's strip away the artifice.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
You bought yourself a company birthday cake and I love it. Okay, I bought myself a birthday

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
cake. I celebrate it, but let's just look this in the face.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Am I good?

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
In order for me to answer this

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I have to know if you... Don't say your last name

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
from this point forward. I will not.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Enjoy working at the company that you work with. I love it. Oh, well, shit.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
This would have been way easier and way funnier if you hadn't.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Hey, listen. What's your rep at the office?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Like, are you, like, the bad boy or what's up?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Lovable rogue. I'm kind of the bad boy. I was the new guy for a long time

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
and then we just hired two new people. You didn't say that like someone who's kind of a bad... I'm kind of a bad guy.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It's also hard to say, I'm kind of a bad boy while cosplaying

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
as Ralphie from The Simpsons.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
How much was it a fucking

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
cake boss cake or what are we talking about? No, it's like a

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
big box store fucking it's Costco sheet cake.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Like a Kroger, it's got that Kroger Whippy on there? Yeah, I mean it's...

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
You guys don't have Krogers around here, fucking forget me, sorry. Ralphs.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Ralphs. Ralphs got good cake or what's up?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Ralphs is Kroger. I bet a Seinfeld response on that one.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I think... Did anybody else eat the cake?

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Ralphie hasn't happened yet. Oh shit. Are you planning on sharing the cake or is it

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
just a James cake? So now this is the thing, because I know you guys have very strong

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
opinions on surprising yourself. Yeah, it's impossible?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Is that what you mean? That's not how brains work?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
So now I have to act surprised and be really amped and say, guys did you do this

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
for me? Oh wait, wait, wait.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
You did not give me a grift alert. I did not know there was a grift happening.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
That's a different deal. If you pull that off like, oh my god you guys,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
that's the fucking best. Now that's so good. This is it.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
When is this party? Because I swear to god we will hold this episode

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
for a year.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Oh, misspell your name on the case. So good.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Then you get them to feel guilty for something they didn't do. Really guys?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Really guys? Really?

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
The G? Honestly. That's just games.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
It does actually say

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
to the office bad boy. I mean if you weren't the bad boy before

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
you are going to be eating your grift cake.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I'm so excited for you. This is going to be the most delicious cake anybody's ever eaten.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000
So I'm going to spin this into a grift. Thank you. Oh no, you already did. And don't pretend like

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
you didn't this whole time. It was your idea. It was your grift.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Dude, own it. I just wanted to be validated.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Well, does that help? Yep. Enjoy the cake. Thank you.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Enjoy your cake.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I think that's going to do it. Thank you to the Balboa. It's been completely

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
fucking rad to do shows here two nights in a row.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Thank you to our dad for

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
doing our intro for us.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Thank you to John Roderick from John at Long Winters for the use of our

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
theme song. It's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed. That was fucking

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
so cool. Hey, so Monday night we're going to be on

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
at midnight? Yeah.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
So if you all want to like watch that and then like tweet. I think it comes on at 11.30.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I don't think that's a joke. I think that's real. But please don't tweet like

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
they were so bad they had to cancel the show because it's not very funny. Please. And this is specifically

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
the 2,000 people who already tweeted that.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
It's real funny. But anyway, please watch because we'll do our best.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I don't know. We'll see. Thank you all so much for

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
coming. Yeah, and for sticking around so late. How about that final? Oh, I also want to

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
say I'm real sorry that we sold out of posters. We thought

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
we had more than enough. Yeah, we fucked up. We never know how many to do. You all are just too kind and generous and

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
you bought too much stuff. We'll do better next time. We'll do better next time. Here's a

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
final yahoo sent in by Seth Carlson. Thank you, Seth.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Seth sits in some bangers. Fuck.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Yeah, say it. Well, no, it sucks now. Say it.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000
It's from Shrek.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Because it was funny before, but now that I know it's Shrek, it's probably... Anyway.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
If Spider-Man shoots webs from his hand

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
and Batman shoots bats from his hand, what does the Hulk shoot from his hand?

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
My name is Travis. I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
This has been my brother, my brother, and me. Kiss your dad.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Square on the left. Peace. Bye.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Thank you.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000
