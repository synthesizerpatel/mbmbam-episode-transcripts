00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.920
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the modern era.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am, let me check my notes,

00:51.040 --> 00:55.440
your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby, Griffin.

00:55.440 --> 01:02.240
Why didn't you feed me? Oh, wow. Hey, Griffin, you just actually gave me shutters

01:02.240 --> 01:05.120
because I've got two kids now, and Justin's got two kids,

01:05.120 --> 01:08.720
and the idea of introducing a new baby to my family again?

01:08.720 --> 01:10.480
Well, here I am. It's heartbreaking. Oh, boy.

01:11.040 --> 01:15.600
Griffin has introduced, this is actually a perfect segue, Griffin,

01:15.600 --> 01:18.080
what you just said about the fact that you're a baby.

01:18.080 --> 01:24.960
What's that segue? Help me understand with my baby brain. Milk, please.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.120
Here's what I wanted to say. It's 20-funny, feel your life with laughter and love,

01:29.120 --> 01:32.560
and I feel like to do that, we're going to need to make changes in how we conduct

01:32.560 --> 01:35.200
ourselves in our daily lives. How are you taking care of yourself?

01:35.200 --> 01:40.160
No more baby play? No, it's not that. For this episode,

01:40.160 --> 01:43.520
I was thinking about sometimes in this podcast, and I hate to admit it,

01:43.520 --> 01:46.720
but sometimes we say things we don't mean to try to make people laugh.

01:48.640 --> 01:53.840
That's shameful to admit, but I'm going to go ahead. Griffin just said that he was a baby,

01:53.840 --> 01:58.160
but that's not true. I was a lie. Certifiable lie.

01:58.880 --> 02:02.640
That's not true, what Griffin just said. He's not a baby. For this episode,

02:02.640 --> 02:06.000
I'd like to say that I only want to say stuff that we really mean,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.080
and we could really stand behind it as true. Can I zero in real quick?

02:10.080 --> 02:15.200
Can we speak in metaphor and simile? Yeah, that's a literary thing.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.760
I just don't want you to say things you don't mean.

02:17.760 --> 02:24.080
But if I said, I'm a total baby, that's different than, I am a baby, goo goo gaga.

02:24.080 --> 02:28.000
I think Justin's on some The Giver shit, where it's like, you can't say,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.320
oh man, I'm really starving right now, because it's false,

02:32.320 --> 02:35.520
and now we're going to turn you into goo, or whatever.

02:35.520 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, just truth speak in this episode. Can I speak my truth for a moment?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.600
Yeah, please Travis. Stretch your legs.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.080
This is not just a joke I'm making to be funny on the show.

02:46.080 --> 02:53.200
You fucking don't have to clarify that. It is so obviously the premise.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.920
If someone offered to pay me a hundred thousand dollars,

02:55.920 --> 02:58.640
I could not name who is playing in the big game this year.

02:59.360 --> 03:04.720
Okay, this is interesting. I am in the same boat, Travis.

03:04.720 --> 03:09.520
I was informed last night by my wife of who the teams are in it.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.960
I believe this one's going to be the four nines,

03:12.960 --> 03:15.840
and I think it's also going to be the chefs in this one.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.440
Great Googly Moogly. You remember that?

03:17.440 --> 03:20.000
No, but if you remember Great Googly Moogly from-

03:20.000 --> 03:21.600
Justin, I want to play along with this bit,

03:21.600 --> 03:24.880
but if I can't reference the Great Googly Moogly Snickers commercial,

03:24.880 --> 03:26.400
what the fuck are we even doing here?

03:26.400 --> 03:29.440
Okay, but I love that, but I do want to say, you said the chefs,

03:29.440 --> 03:32.560
and I need to dial in and to see if you think the name

03:32.560 --> 03:35.760
of the professional football outfit is the chefs,

03:35.760 --> 03:38.400
or if you have violated our contract of speaking the truth.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.040
I also said the four nines, and I feel like-

03:41.040 --> 03:45.200
That could be, that's debatable. Actually, it is a four and a nine.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.880
Yeah, no, I got a buddy who's a diehard Chiefs fan.

03:48.880 --> 03:53.680
He's over the moon excited, so I'm trying to glom on to that

03:53.680 --> 03:58.560
to give even the littlest bit of a shit about that Super Bowl,

03:58.560 --> 04:01.440
but I will say, and this is my honesty, you know this,

04:01.440 --> 04:04.000
the shine doesn't come off that holiday apple

04:04.800 --> 04:09.840
as soon as my body stopped being able to process buffalo flavorings.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.800
Yes. As soon as my tummy was like,

04:12.800 --> 04:15.520
what's the plan for tonight, Chief? It's Sunday, big game.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.840
I'll be like, oh, I was going to go over to my friend's house.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.240
Ah, cool, cool, cool. Here's a list of rules.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.480
No ranches, no buffalos, no cheeses.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.200
You may have a plate of ancient grains.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.600
You may have one bowl of quinoa.

04:30.560 --> 04:35.120
I knew that it was over when during my Super Bowl planning,

04:35.120 --> 04:36.720
I uttered the phrase, oh yeah, nice,

04:36.720 --> 04:38.640
I think they have a cauliflower crust.

04:38.640 --> 04:43.680
That is it, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.320
So anyway, I am looking forward to seeing the boys out there

04:46.320 --> 04:48.640
throw an old hog ball around, trying to get,

04:49.440 --> 04:53.360
it's so hard to be earnest for one whole 60 minute period.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.800
You said you're looking forward to it,

04:54.800 --> 04:57.280
but then earlier you said you didn't give a shit.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.720
So which is it, Griffin?

04:58.720 --> 05:01.040
I mean, I want to see the boys throw the hog ball.

05:01.040 --> 05:04.640
I want to see that, I want to see that hog sack get chucked.

05:04.640 --> 05:09.040
I'm gonna say that I like just an event where a lot of people

05:09.040 --> 05:11.920
seem to be, you know, culture is so fractured now.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.000
I like an event where everybody's just kind of

05:14.000 --> 05:16.960
on the same page and watching the same thing

05:16.960 --> 05:18.560
they don't really care about very much,

05:18.560 --> 05:20.800
but at least we're all getting together and doing it.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.560
Who's doing that halftime show?

05:22.560 --> 05:24.880
You know, I think, I think I don't know

05:24.880 --> 05:27.600
and I haven't cared until now.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.720
We're being so honest.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.040
It's Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, holy hell.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.880
That one's gonna be good.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.640
Pepsi's gonna do us right on that one.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.080
I wonder if they'll use drones.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.040
I bet they'll use drones.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.720
They've used drones the last couple of years.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.440
Yeah, I mean, they'll probably both open their mouths

05:41.440 --> 05:43.200
letting out a swarm of nano drones,

05:43.760 --> 05:46.400
which will go into the audience

05:46.400 --> 05:49.760
and give everybody a set of new AirPod Pros.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.440
Now, Griffin, do you think, do you honestly think

05:54.160 --> 05:57.200
that's a real scenario that could happen?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.720
I'm just, do you think that that's a scenario

06:00.720 --> 06:01.680
that could happen?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.920
I think it, hey, it can happen.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.040
So that's gonna be a new thing that I'm working,

06:07.040 --> 06:07.760
it could happen.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.560
That's our obligatory football discussion.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.800
Far more earnest this year than past years.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.360
That's about where we're at with the Super Bowl.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.080
I don't know if the audience enjoyed it, but I did.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.520
I like not having to put up a front and pretend like I care.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.240
Now that said, I'll probably tune in.

06:26.240 --> 06:30.720
I'll probably check out maybe like a middle 14, 15 minutes.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.240
The best bit, oh, that's the heart of it.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.240
Yeah, I'll watch the seven minutes

06:36.240 --> 06:38.480
before the halftime show.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.160
You don't wanna watch the last two quarters

06:40.160 --> 06:42.400
when all the boys are so tired already.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.600
So tired, and they're sending in, let's be honest,

06:45.600 --> 06:47.680
second and third string players.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.480
Yeah, here comes fucking Dan Marino.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.760
Do you think there is a player on the team

06:54.560 --> 06:59.280
that knows they're the worst and is going into the game

06:59.280 --> 07:03.920
hoping, just like wondering like, I might get,

07:03.920 --> 07:07.600
there is like maybe three to four people on the planet

07:07.600 --> 07:09.120
that are going to this game thinking like,

07:09.120 --> 07:12.720
I might get to play in the Super Bowl, and I might not.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.200
I actually don't know if I'll be participating

07:15.200 --> 07:16.400
in this year's Super Bowl.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.520
Here's what I'll say, J-Man.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.800
If there are anything like me, having been the worst player

07:20.800 --> 07:24.080
on a lot of teams in my life, they're probably thinking,

07:24.080 --> 07:26.160
God, I hope I don't have to play in the Super Bowl.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.560
Fuck, I hope my dad's not here.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.280
Yeah, I'm fine sitting on the bench.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.240
I have the best seat in the house, are you kidding me?

07:34.240 --> 07:36.160
Travis was sort of an anti-Rudy.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.360
Yes, please don't send me out there.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.520
His whole team laid their jerseys down

07:41.520 --> 07:44.160
on the coach's desk saying, seriously though,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.680
have you seen Travis's body?

07:47.680 --> 07:49.440
Holy shit, if you put him out there to wrestle.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.680
Travis asked us to come in here and tell you.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.440
He said he was worried about, quote, being annihilated.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.560
So here's my jersey, please don't put him in, coach.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.960
Travis is just wearing jeans and a T-shirt.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.080
He's watching the game on his phone on the bench.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.000
Please don't put Travis in.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.360
He's holding a big sign that says, I got ringworm.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.080
Yes, I do.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.160
So I don't even think he's allowed to be on the court.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.000
I don't think Travis showed up.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.560
I think he just kind of Skyped into the game.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.800
Please don't put iPad Travis on the field.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.640
Let's do our show.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.760
This is our show.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.760
Well, let's do the real stuff.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.040
Get to the middle, mate.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.600
I want to get to the middle 14, as Travis has called it.

08:29.600 --> 08:29.840
Yes.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.000
Where do I look when I'm being serenaded by my boyfriend?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.360
For the exit.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.240
The only options I could think of are

08:40.240 --> 08:42.960
to stare at him dead in the eyes and smile awkwardly,

08:42.960 --> 08:46.800
look at my phone, or pretend to be tired and fall asleep.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.840
Each option sucks, but I really like his music.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.800
That's from Creepily Staring in Washington State.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.920
Wow, that's actually a difficult question to answer.

08:55.920 --> 08:56.960
It's a real one.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.680
I'm really glad you clarified that you do enjoy

09:00.640 --> 09:03.120
the being serenaded experience, because otherwise-

09:03.120 --> 09:05.680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.480
They enjoy the music.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.200
Ooh.

09:09.200 --> 09:13.200
The serenading experience probably sucks shit.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.240
I read your mind.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.760
You're talking about a masked singer kind of scenario,

09:17.760 --> 09:19.920
but maybe masked listener.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.400
Now we're talking.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.360
There's that.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.320
Now we're cooking.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.560
Yeah, imagine masked singer,

09:26.560 --> 09:29.520
but Chrissy Teigen is the one in the mask.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.040
Maybe she's paying attention.

09:31.040 --> 09:31.840
Maybe she's not.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.200
We don't know.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.760
The nice thing about this is once you establish

09:35.760 --> 09:37.600
your masked listener character,

09:37.600 --> 09:40.720
you could maybe sub in your nephew or dog

09:40.720 --> 09:44.080
if you get bored of the music.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.640
Let me suggest this response.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.480
You kind of push your fingertips together,

09:50.480 --> 09:53.520
a crease, make a triangle with your hands,

09:54.160 --> 09:57.360
and you close your eyes and you kind of tell them,

09:57.360 --> 09:58.400
yes, go on, go on.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.640
And you nod along with your eyes closed.

10:00.640 --> 10:04.000
You are just soaking it in.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.440
I gotta close my, I'm using too many of my other senses.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.880
I'm gonna plug up my dang nose and cover my eyes

10:10.880 --> 10:13.040
so that my ears are like, hell yeah, baby.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.160
We got more energy.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.720
The ship has transferred more energy over to us, the ears.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.220
Yes.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.640
Maybe you can look at your boyfriend and say,

10:22.640 --> 10:24.800
wow, this music is really cool,

10:25.440 --> 10:27.520
and you know what that's got me itching for.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.080
And then you put on some shades.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.080
Oh, okay.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.960
So far, are all of these earnest answers?

10:35.840 --> 10:36.000
No.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.920
Yeah, I mean, I think all of them will be good.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.120
Maybe not the masked singer one,

10:41.120 --> 10:45.840
but I would do the kind of steeple fingers.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.480
Steeple fingers closing your eyes is very good.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.120
I think sabotaging it, but in a loving way,

10:51.120 --> 10:52.320
is also really good.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.560
Where just like as soon as he starts playing,

10:54.560 --> 10:56.560
as soon as he starts playing Wonderwall,

10:56.560 --> 10:58.480
you can just kinda like,

11:00.640 --> 11:02.320
Yeah, man, yeah, that's great.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.560
I love this.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.080
If you do that enough,

11:06.080 --> 11:08.240
then there's no way they're gonna be able to keep tempo.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.320
This rocks, dude.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.440
Yeah, you could do what my daughter does

11:13.440 --> 11:16.320
and just say, no, no singing.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.080
Well, that's not it, obviously.

11:18.080 --> 11:22.800
My problem with the closing your eyes

11:22.800 --> 11:24.640
and making steeple fingers

11:24.640 --> 11:27.600
is I feel like if you do that exact thing,

11:28.320 --> 11:30.000
when your boyfriend finishes playing,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.440
he's gonna be very disappointed

11:31.440 --> 11:33.840
if you don't open your eyes and are just like,

11:33.840 --> 11:35.840
that's it, I've heard enough.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.240
Yeah.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.680
This is the sound I've been looking for.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.000
Sign this contract.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.440
Welcome to Superstar Records.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.240
I've been Randy Jackson the whole time

11:46.240 --> 11:48.880
and I've been deep, deep undercover.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.240
Now, can you start clapping loudly

11:52.240 --> 11:54.320
and tell your boyfriend to match your tempo?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.240
Oh, that's great.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.920
Maybe throw a cymbal at them.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.280
Hit it on the one and the three.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.840
Just really goof him up.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.640
You're dragging.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.760
You could focus really intently on his fingers,

12:07.760 --> 12:09.040
like, how is he doing this?

12:10.320 --> 12:12.400
Just lean in closer and closer.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.120
Do it, Santana, I'm loving this.

12:15.120 --> 12:15.120
Yes.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.360
Okay, I'm trying to put myself in the position.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.600
The closest I think I've ever been

12:21.600 --> 12:24.880
is like when my friends were in bands

12:25.840 --> 12:28.240
or were writing music or something,

12:28.240 --> 12:29.360
mostly in college,

12:29.360 --> 12:30.960
and would play me some of their stuff

12:32.000 --> 12:34.080
and just like on their computer

12:34.080 --> 12:35.600
and I had to be there.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.120
And I think we can all agree,

12:37.120 --> 12:38.320
the eyes are a non-starter.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.440
You cannot look in the eyes

12:39.440 --> 12:40.960
because that's the window to the soul

12:40.960 --> 12:42.320
and sometimes you're not ready to see

12:42.320 --> 12:44.400
what is swirling around on there.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.200
So most of the time,

12:45.200 --> 12:47.040
I would just kind of look down at the ground

12:47.040 --> 12:49.520
and then like after a few bars,

12:50.240 --> 12:52.080
I just kind of get a smile on my face.

12:52.080 --> 12:52.720
Like, yeah.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.040
And you just sort of nod my head like, yeah.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.280
This is the 100% earnest answer.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.040
I'm just like, I can't look at you,

12:59.040 --> 13:00.800
but you can tell from my bump in my head

13:00.800 --> 13:02.960
and smiling that this is a great little

13:03.600 --> 13:04.800
slice of Americana.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.280
Literally, Griffin, as you were,

13:08.240 --> 13:10.400
even before you said like bopping the head,

13:10.400 --> 13:11.360
I want you to know,

13:11.360 --> 13:14.000
I started instinctively bopping my head

13:14.000 --> 13:15.680
just picturing listening to music

13:15.680 --> 13:16.640
because, and you're right,

13:16.640 --> 13:18.240
because if I'm looking you in the eyes

13:18.240 --> 13:19.840
while you play your music

13:19.840 --> 13:21.920
and I'm bobbing my head,

13:21.920 --> 13:23.440
it's going to be impossible for me

13:23.440 --> 13:25.040
not to start to say things like,

13:25.040 --> 13:29.280
oh yeah, oh, uh-huh, that's it.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.160
You're doing it.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.240
Like, there is no way

13:32.240 --> 13:34.880
I could just make eye contact and bob my head

13:34.880 --> 13:35.760
because here's the thing,

13:35.760 --> 13:36.880
if you start that way,

13:37.520 --> 13:39.680
at some point you have to look away

13:39.680 --> 13:41.440
and no matter when that happens,

13:41.440 --> 13:43.360
it's gonna be bad, right?

13:43.360 --> 13:46.880
Because then it's like, and no more.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.160
Playing guitar is a shameful thing

13:50.160 --> 13:51.360
and it should be done in private.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.480
I don't feel that way.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.400
I actually think that there are many contexts

13:56.400 --> 13:58.240
in which a little guitar music is nice

13:58.240 --> 13:59.360
and obviously there's a lot of people

13:59.360 --> 14:01.360
that make a living from guitar music,

14:01.360 --> 14:03.280
so I don't actually think it's a shameful thing.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.960
Carlos Santana, mentioned him earlier.

14:07.920 --> 14:08.880
Joe Satriani.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.520
Okay, two.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.440
Bela Fleck plays banjo,

14:13.440 --> 14:15.280
which is just around guitar.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.400
Okay, to name three guitarists,

14:18.400 --> 14:20.720
one of them had to play banjo for you.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.600
Okay, interesting.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.680
He's a rural jazz banjoist.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.440
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Graham Robach.

14:27.440 --> 14:27.840
Thank you, Graham.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.200
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

14:29.200 --> 14:30.640
who I'm gonna call Bela Fleck who asks,

14:31.440 --> 14:34.560
how can I ask my friends to throw a pie

14:34.560 --> 14:36.720
in my face on my b-day?

14:36.720 --> 14:39.360
Oh, so my b-day, it's coming up

14:39.360 --> 14:41.840
and I'm gonna go all out for drinks and food.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.640
Funny thing is, I've always wanted to be pied in the face.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.000
I'll be drunk, so it will be even more funny.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.280
But I'm going to be wearing party slash going out clothes

14:53.280 --> 14:54.800
and will def have makeup on.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.280
So I wanna get messy to make it more funny,

14:57.280 --> 14:59.680
but at the same time, not completely ruin my outfit.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.520
I'll probably be wearing a leather skirt

15:01.520 --> 15:02.720
and bodysuit IDK,

15:02.720 --> 15:05.120
but I really wanna make this the b-day

15:05.120 --> 15:06.960
I get pied in the face.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.720
How do I go about doing this?

15:08.720 --> 15:10.480
Like asking also what kind of pie

15:10.480 --> 15:12.000
would be best to be thrown in my face?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.440
I would like something that is comical,

15:13.440 --> 15:16.880
like makes a splat sound when the pie hits me in the face.

15:16.880 --> 15:17.360
Thanks.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.000
Yes.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.880
Obbs.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.400
Obbs, you want a splat sound.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.920
You don't want like a pecan pie.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.880
That would just hurt.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.800
Fuck, that would be rough.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.040
It's so good.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.600
That's a dense pie experience.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.160
Heads up.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.840
Clang, boing, boing, boing, boing.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.000
It just fell to the ground, unaffected.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.760
It made a perfect mold of my face.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.160
Like one of those pin toys.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.200
That's no good.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.920
You want like a, in fact, just a pie tin,

15:44.960 --> 15:49.920
an aluminum soft like flexible pie tin full of whipped cream.

15:49.920 --> 15:50.960
It's really all you need.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.560
Yeah, I feel like it's funnier though

15:54.560 --> 15:57.520
if it's got cherries and some crust.

15:57.520 --> 16:01.840
Well, cherries are going to stain maybe like a custard.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.320
Hey, this is maybe a perversion,

16:04.320 --> 16:06.320
but now I'm just thinking about what it would feel like

16:06.320 --> 16:09.440
to have your face sort of slowly pressed into a pumpkin pie.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.360
Pumpkin pie is different.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.800
Pumpkin pie is solid.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.760
That would make us, holy, you want to talk about the splat sound.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.840
Pumpkin pie is going to get you there, baby.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.440
What about a cheesecake?

16:19.440 --> 16:22.320
A cheesecake's going to make that same yucky splat.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.760
Oh, shit.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.960
Here's the problem.

16:24.960 --> 16:29.520
I don't think, I think just to run it back to the very beginning of the premise,

16:30.240 --> 16:35.680
I think that in the asking, you ruin it, right?

16:35.680 --> 16:38.400
Because then you're going to be like spending the whole evening,

16:38.400 --> 16:39.840
like your anticipation,

16:40.400 --> 16:43.600
this is one of those things where sometimes anticipation

16:43.600 --> 16:45.040
makes you excited for something,

16:45.040 --> 16:49.040
but knowing a pie is coming because you asked them to do it

16:49.040 --> 16:51.520
removes all spontaneity of it, right?

16:51.520 --> 16:53.840
Like it seems to me,

16:53.840 --> 16:56.160
oh, I think it just makes it more delectable

16:56.160 --> 17:01.440
because then you know that creepy surprise could come at any moment.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.600
I think it's got to be reverse psychology though.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.200
I think for weeks ahead of your birthday,

17:05.200 --> 17:06.240
you have to say things like,

17:06.240 --> 17:08.240
I just, whatever we do guys,

17:08.240 --> 17:10.160
I just don't want to get pied in the face.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.040
Am I right?

17:11.040 --> 17:11.840
Huh?

17:11.840 --> 17:14.960
That would be too silly for me to even deal with.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.760
Turn on a fucking, turn on an episode of What Would You Do

17:17.760 --> 17:20.160
with Mark Summers, not with John Quinones,

17:20.160 --> 17:22.960
and just like every time anybody gets slimed or splatted or pied,

17:22.960 --> 17:26.160
I'd just be like, oh, the indignity.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.480
Oh, can you even believe it?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.600
Did you see that?

17:29.600 --> 17:31.040
He got pied in the face.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.240
He could have gotten killed.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.840
I would like to ask a request

17:35.840 --> 17:39.760
on behalf of all of the restaurant and bar owners

17:39.760 --> 17:41.840
that you may be attending on your birthday.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.000
I would kindly request that you not do that

17:44.560 --> 17:46.160
sort of in my business.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.440
I would very much like to not have to sort of deal

17:49.440 --> 17:51.440
with the repercussions of your pie mess.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.040
Okay, here's what you do.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.480
And Justin, I've taken your concerns

17:57.840 --> 17:58.960
into consideration here.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.160
That's a first.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.880
And, well, okay, hey, we don't need to air that

18:02.880 --> 18:04.080
in front of everybody, but,

18:04.720 --> 18:08.000
and you're not going to mess up your outfit this way.

18:08.000 --> 18:08.800
Oh.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.080
But this is going to have to be

18:11.360 --> 18:13.040
something executed by your friends.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.880
So stop listening for a second.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.760
Friends, listen, you're going to put the pie

18:17.760 --> 18:18.800
on the table in front of them.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.240
You're going to say, I worked so hard on this pie

18:22.960 --> 18:25.760
and I put a little something extra special

18:25.760 --> 18:28.080
in the whipped cream, smell it,

18:28.080 --> 18:29.600
and see if you can guess what it is.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.000
And then you're going to push their face into it.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.080
No pie in face, face in pie.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.520
It's going to control the whole splatter.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.000
I tell you what, man, just start,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.840
you could, if you want to do it Travis's way,

18:41.840 --> 18:45.360
you could just slowly scoop spoonfuls of pie filling

18:45.360 --> 18:48.240
and cream directly onto the areas of the face.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.120
Almost like you're doing some sort of rejuvenative mask.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.560
Because if we're going to,

18:53.280 --> 18:55.680
if we're going to just sort of break the laws

18:55.680 --> 18:57.120
as Travis has suggested,

18:57.120 --> 19:00.720
you know that this is this person's yucky splat perversion

19:00.720 --> 19:03.440
and that is not going to get the fucking job done, Travis.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.480
They need the terror of it.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.520
They need the horny fear of this pie.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.040
What if you're so excited for this,

19:13.040 --> 19:15.200
you think this is going to be the funniest shit in the world

19:15.200 --> 19:16.560
and then your friends pie you

19:16.560 --> 19:18.000
and suddenly you realize like,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I fucking hate this.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.480
Have you two boys ever been pie in the face?

19:22.480 --> 19:23.840
Yes, I've been pie in the face.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.520
I got pie in the face at church once,

19:26.320 --> 19:27.600
not during even youth group,

19:29.440 --> 19:31.840
during a Sunday sermon about gambling.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.120
I don't think I have.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.520
I got splatted right in the face

19:35.520 --> 19:36.880
and folks let me tell you at home,

19:37.680 --> 19:38.320
it's funny,

19:39.520 --> 19:43.920
but you are being hit in the face with an object.

19:43.920 --> 19:44.560
Yes.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.160
And that feels bad.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.480
You have to come from the side, by the way.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.960
It can't be direct at nose

19:50.960 --> 19:53.840
because there is a plate in there.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.920
Feels no good.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.920
You gotta aim for the cheek.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.360
Aim for the cheeks.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.760
So maybe that's the secret,

20:01.760 --> 20:04.560
but I definitely think that this is a nasty thing

20:04.560 --> 20:09.440
that this person wants for sex reasons and sex purposes.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.120
What's with all the judgment?

20:11.120 --> 20:13.440
I'm not judging, I'm stating a fact.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.280
You actively said nasty.

20:15.280 --> 20:20.880
No, they like that it's nasty, Justin.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.440
Okay.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.800
Like when I call them a sick freak,

20:24.800 --> 20:26.880
that's part of it for them.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.560
Capital S, capital F.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.760
They love that.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.920
In the grand fullness of time

20:31.920 --> 20:34.000
with everyone who's ever lived on the planet,

20:34.880 --> 20:37.200
do you think that at least once

20:37.200 --> 20:39.840
someone has died from getting pie in the face?

20:39.840 --> 20:41.040
Yeah, absolutely, 100%.

20:41.040 --> 20:46.880
I think probably half a dozen clowns have died for this reason.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.400
Here's what I imagine happened.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.720
A first-timer pies their friend in the face,

20:50.720 --> 20:52.560
they leave it on there for two minutes

20:52.560 --> 20:54.240
and they just keep their hand up there.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.440
All of a sudden, their friend just collapses

20:57.440 --> 20:58.720
in a bottle on the floor.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.560
It's not funny anymore.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.240
I could see that.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.520
I could also see maybe getting, like I said,

21:05.520 --> 21:08.080
direct on nose, direct nose hit,

21:08.080 --> 21:09.680
but you come up and at an angle

21:09.680 --> 21:12.240
like we're all afraid of when you get hit in the nose,

21:12.240 --> 21:12.800
right in the brain.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.360
That's it.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.760
So I think let's just put out a PSA, folks.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.920
Pie the butt, pie the crotch.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.920
One of those two is going to be even funnier

21:19.920 --> 21:23.920
and there's not going to be a lot of bad brain-based damage.

21:23.920 --> 21:27.280
I'm just going to say belly button pie, it's not bad.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.320
That's funny.

21:28.320 --> 21:28.960
That's funny.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
A pie hitting you anywhere is funny.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.080
A pie anywhere but being held in your hands

21:34.080 --> 21:35.680
to be served at a table,

21:35.680 --> 21:36.720
that's not where a pie should be.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.480
Comedy is all about the unexpected.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.560
It's upside down on top of the head.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.880
Don't do it right side up on top of the head.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.000
You'd have to balance it.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.040
Here comes another question.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.800
I made a fuck ton of chili,

21:48.800 --> 21:50.640
which I plan to freeze in batches

21:50.640 --> 21:52.720
and consume over a long period of time.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.240
However, I just lost my job.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.640
So for the moment, all I have to eat is chili.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.320
How can I spice up my chili eating

21:58.320 --> 22:00.000
to make it a bit more diverse?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.400
This is from Too Much Chili in Chile,

22:02.400 --> 22:07.040
pronounced Chi-li-i, New York.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.000
It's Chi-la.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.040
Too Much Chili in Chi-li-i, New York.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.600
It's so weird that you live there, by the way.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.080
What a coincidence.

22:14.080 --> 22:14.800
Considering.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.960
You have a lot of chili.

22:18.480 --> 22:22.080
You don't want to eat the chili, but you must.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.680
Yeah, because-

22:23.680 --> 22:26.320
They did want to eat the chili, broadly speaking.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.720
Yes, they wanted to eventually eat the chili.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.160
Right, but in this economy?

22:33.280 --> 22:34.160
I don't know what that means,

22:34.160 --> 22:36.720
but I assume it means that you gotta eat the chili.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.000
But how can you spice up?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.800
All right, let's get all the bad Cincinnati-based

22:40.800 --> 22:41.920
bullshit out of the way.

22:41.920 --> 22:42.720
Spaghetti.

22:43.520 --> 22:43.920
Gone.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.920
Hot dogs.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.960
Tiny hot dogs.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.160
Little, little dogs.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.520
Little Franks, if I may.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.840
Can I make a point, though?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.200
I do want to be clear.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.800
If they had money for hot dogs,

22:56.800 --> 22:58.320
this wouldn't be an issue.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.320
This is not the question that is before us.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.560
They are not buying other food.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.120
They need to spice up just chili.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.760
Like, you can't say, like, put it on top of a burger.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.560
That's not the option here.

23:10.560 --> 23:15.520
I think we need to get kind of like a gastro pub.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.000
Maybe take this molecular science kind of thing.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.920
Maybe we need to freeze dry some chili.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.320
Okay, I was gonna say, I don't know.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.800
I mean, okay, you freeze dry the chili trap,

23:24.800 --> 23:27.200
but you don't have money to go out and buy liquid nitrogen.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.600
So I guess you just put it in the freezer for a long time.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.520
Yes, these are my chili popsicle.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.160
You grate that.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.640
Ooh, chili popsicles is very, very good.

23:34.640 --> 23:39.760
You can reduce it and keep reducing it until it's just gone.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.680
And that can be a fun science experiment for kids.

23:41.680 --> 23:46.160
Maybe like a chili mist that you just puff.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.880
Chili volcano, spicy prank slime.

23:50.880 --> 23:54.480
Maybe a chili IV, puff the chili.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.240
Use its abrasive properties to cleanse your face skin.

23:58.800 --> 24:03.600
Throw some chili and some ice cubes into a blender.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.520
Make yourself a smoothie.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.760
That only works if you've got a blender.

24:07.760 --> 24:11.600
If you don't, stuff the chili and ice cubes in a big Ziploc bag

24:11.600 --> 24:13.360
and just start stomping, baby.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.000
Maybe rather than we spice up the chili itself,

24:18.720 --> 24:22.480
we rather make the consumption experience more interesting.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.560
Take the chili with you to different locations.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.400
Enjoy your chili at the movies.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
Enjoy your chili while feeding the ducks.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.240
Would you put you in a boat?

24:30.240 --> 24:34.800
Hey, I want to give you guys an idea

24:34.800 --> 24:37.440
and just tell me if it's anything, okay?

24:37.440 --> 24:39.120
Because I'm not really sure right now.

24:39.120 --> 24:39.840
Is it earnest?

24:39.840 --> 24:42.000
But yeah, it is earnest.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.200
This is something you could do.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.600
What if you added a little bit of salt to the chili, okay?

24:49.600 --> 24:53.920
And then you tasted it and then you added more salt

24:53.920 --> 24:55.760
and you just tasted it again.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.400
And then you kept repeating that process

24:58.400 --> 25:00.640
until it was so salty that you couldn't,

25:01.440 --> 25:03.760
you really just couldn't, you know what I mean?

25:03.760 --> 25:06.880
And then the next day you do the exact same thing again

25:06.880 --> 25:11.120
and with presumably more salt.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.520
You build up a tolerance.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.760
So yeah, so what I'm thinking is

25:15.760 --> 25:17.920
at the end of this experience,

25:17.920 --> 25:19.920
it will have been difficult for you

25:20.480 --> 25:22.240
but you'll be able to brag like,

25:22.240 --> 25:24.080
no matter how salty that chili is,

25:24.080 --> 25:25.760
I'll be able to enjoy it.

25:25.760 --> 25:30.880
I can take my chili saltier than anybody you know.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.920
I can take the saltiest chili down, no problem.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.680
Hey Terry, how are you?

25:35.680 --> 25:37.120
Well, it's been a rough month.

25:39.360 --> 25:42.160
But the good news is no matter how salty a chili,

25:42.160 --> 25:44.880
I'm never going to send a chili back for being too salty.

25:44.880 --> 25:48.240
A lot of people would try spice,

25:48.240 --> 25:50.480
make it spicier and spicier and build up a,

25:50.480 --> 25:54.880
I think that that reeks of a sort of false machismo.

25:54.880 --> 25:55.520
Yeah.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.960
I don't think you should do that.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.880
You want the most brackish chili.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.240
Give me the dead sea chili.

26:02.240 --> 26:06.080
Yeah, Justin, you realize the other side of this

26:06.080 --> 26:08.480
is that all chili is going to taste

26:08.480 --> 26:10.880
absolutely fucking flavorless.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.280
Yes, it'll be like eating chili

26:13.280 --> 26:15.600
in a commercial for antidepressants.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.680
Like you'll take a bite and it's like mm.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.600
You'll look down and it'll be gray.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.640
Everything's all gray.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.800
Yeah, but like you will have a fun personality

26:24.800 --> 26:28.720
quirk of like, hey, I went to go eat chili with Derek

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
and this is going to sound insane

26:30.720 --> 26:33.440
when he unscrewed the top of the salt shaker

26:34.480 --> 26:36.880
and just dumped it right in.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.040
Oh, you mean, you mean never pissed Derek?

26:41.440 --> 26:42.720
You're talking about shriveled Derek?

26:43.280 --> 26:45.360
The weirdest part was all the deer in his yard

26:45.360 --> 26:46.320
looking to lick him.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.000
That was maybe the strangest part

26:48.000 --> 26:49.360
of going to Derek's house.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.200
This is so, I'm really enjoying this

26:51.200 --> 26:52.800
and that last one was kind of funny,

26:52.800 --> 26:55.440
but I do think it's about the time in the recording

26:55.440 --> 26:56.960
where we should stop for a moment

26:56.960 --> 27:00.000
to read the messages from our sponsors.

27:00.000 --> 27:12.960
All right, Travis, now do advertisements

27:12.960 --> 27:14.480
without saying anything you don't mean.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.480
I love me undies.

27:16.480 --> 27:19.600
All of my underpants are me undies.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.200
All of my favorite.

27:21.200 --> 27:27.760
Mariam, why don't you marry him?

27:28.880 --> 27:30.720
There's no law on the books just yet

27:31.360 --> 27:34.160
that says I can marry them, but we'll see.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.200
That's what you say.

27:35.200 --> 27:39.040
2020, now that was not earnest.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.680
I don't think in 2020, there will be a law on the books

27:41.680 --> 27:43.280
that will let me marry my underpants.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.400
Who can say, with this government?

27:47.040 --> 27:47.680
Fair.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.720
This is earnest that if there was

27:50.720 --> 27:54.560
a mandatory law that said I had to commit

27:54.560 --> 27:56.640
to wearing one kind of underpants

27:56.640 --> 27:59.680
for the rest of my life, I would choose me undies.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.080
And here's the thing.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.960
Not only do I love me undies, they love you.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.760
And to show how much they love you,

28:07.760 --> 28:12.480
me undies has not one, but three new Valentine's Day prints.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.960
So you can match with your faves this year,

28:15.600 --> 28:18.320
whether you're matching, well, okay.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.960
Now me undies, you put even your dog.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.640
Is that earnest, me undies?

28:22.640 --> 28:24.480
Yeah, man, they got dog clothes.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.160
Do you have dog underpants?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.600
Yeah, dog buddy bands.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.840
I want to match my pet.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.360
Hey, it was earnest.

28:31.360 --> 28:35.520
And I earnestly apologize for questioning you.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.320

Hey, can I say something earnest?

29:01.600 --> 29:02.100
Yes.

29:02.960 --> 29:03.760
Hey, you've earned.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.280
There it is.

29:06.080 --> 29:06.880
Very good.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.400
Yes.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.360
Finally, you earned it.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.880
Don't fucking do that to me.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.040
Don't do that to me.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.040
We've been doing this 500 episodes.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.240
Don't do that to me.

29:16.240 --> 29:16.720
I liked it.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.440
I enjoyed it.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.560
I liked it.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.080
Stitch Fix is our next one.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.240
Stitch Fix is great.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.320
They send you a box that's going to be

29:26.320 --> 29:28.400
just chock a block full of clothes

29:28.960 --> 29:30.400
and those clothes are going to be picked out

29:30.400 --> 29:32.560
by expert stylists at Stitch Fix

29:32.560 --> 29:34.240

29:34.240 --> 29:36.400

29:36.400 --> 29:39.280
what's going to feel nice on you.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.640
What's your preference?

29:40.640 --> 29:42.800
Is it a season coming up?

29:42.800 --> 29:44.400
They'll keep that in mind.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.880
They'll ship you a box of clothes, shoes and accessories

29:47.440 --> 29:49.200
and then you're going to try it on

30:18.400 --> 30:22.000
You wept as we crafted the tragic tale of Jar Jar,

30:22.000 --> 30:23.360
a Star Wars story.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.280
Do you mean like he forgives Darth Vader?

30:25.280 --> 30:27.280
Mesa still love you, Annie.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.320
You gasped out loud at the shocking twists

30:30.320 --> 30:31.600
of Face Off 2.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.560
Face is wild.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.320
He takes his kid's face.

30:35.120 --> 30:35.360
What?

30:36.320 --> 30:38.560
We're writing an entire screenplay week by week

30:38.560 --> 30:41.440
on StoryBreaks season two, Heaven Heist.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.520
Hey folks, Freddie Wong here with some exciting news

30:43.520 --> 30:45.440
about StoryBreak, the writers room podcast

30:45.440 --> 30:47.120
where three Hollywood professionals have one hour

30:47.120 --> 30:48.560
to spend cinematic gold.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.480
We're shaking up our format by turning Heaven Heist,

30:50.480 --> 30:52.080
one of our favorite ideas we've ever come up with

30:52.080 --> 30:53.760
on the show into a full screenplay.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.120
Heaven Heist is an action comedy

30:55.120 --> 30:56.320
about a crew of misfit gangsters

30:56.320 --> 30:58.080
robbing the celestial bank of heaven.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.360
Think of Coco Meets Point Break.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.600
Join us as we write this crazy movie scene by scene

31:01.600 --> 31:03.680
and get an inside look at the screenwriting process

31:03.680 --> 31:05.760

31:11.840 --> 31:18.000
I want a munch.

31:18.000 --> 31:18.800
Squad.

31:18.800 --> 31:22.720
I want a munch.

31:22.720 --> 31:23.280
Squad.

31:23.280 --> 31:33.280
Pizza Hut will reward first set of twins born after Super Bowl.

31:33.280 --> 31:33.600
What?

31:34.320 --> 31:34.640
How?

31:34.640 --> 31:35.440
How?

31:35.440 --> 31:35.940
Why?

31:37.360 --> 31:38.800
Pizza Hut's going for two

31:41.680 --> 31:45.520
and hoping a couple lucky parents can convert

31:45.520 --> 31:46.720
on Super Bowl Sunday.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.120
They mean give birth to human life.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.720
The pizza restaurant returns to Super Bowl live

31:53.360 --> 31:57.520
for its second year as the official pizza sponsor

31:57.520 --> 32:00.080
of the NFL on February 2nd.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.600
This year, the family that welcomes the first set of twins

32:03.600 --> 32:07.600
born after kickoff is going to get amazing prizes.

32:07.600 --> 32:08.160
Oh, boy.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.320
The press release goes on to say,

32:10.320 --> 32:13.440
a family has always been part of Pizza Hut's DNA,

32:13.440 --> 32:16.160
which is why the restaurant will honor the MVPs

32:16.720 --> 32:19.120
making their own special deliveries this Sunday.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.520
The winning family will get a trip for two

32:23.520 --> 32:26.480
to next year's Super Bowl LV.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.720
Two years of free pizza

32:30.720 --> 32:33.680
and in honor of its ongoing commitment to literacy

32:33.680 --> 32:35.840
through its iconic Book It program

32:35.840 --> 32:40.960
will also reward $22,000 to kick off the twins' education funds

32:40.960 --> 32:43.360
along with a custom curated starter library

32:43.360 --> 32:46.480
and handpicked by the Book It team.

32:47.040 --> 32:50.320
So Pizza Hut's book experts will pick books

32:50.320 --> 32:51.760
to send to your children.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.640
Now, one thing that I find engaging about this

32:55.200 --> 32:58.000
is that the people they have chosen to fly somewhere

32:58.000 --> 33:00.320
to a football game for two,

33:00.320 --> 33:03.440
they know for a motherfucking fact

33:03.440 --> 33:07.920
have two 12-month-olds almost to the day.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.400
Right.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.240
Extremely close to that.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.480
So there is, I would say,

33:12.480 --> 33:16.560
a thin chance of the parents cashing this in.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.080
I think it's kind of a foolproof, foolproof system

33:20.080 --> 33:20.880
they've worked in.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.320
The two years of pizza, they'll be gaga about.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.520
No question about it.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.040
The 22 large.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.240
The 22 large.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.120
That's all right.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.160
That's damn decent.

33:30.160 --> 33:30.660
Sure.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.880
These people are not going to the Super Bowl.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.240
They're not gonna do it.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.080
They're just not gonna do it.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.560
Who better to help Pizza Hut

33:40.560 --> 33:42.480
welcome the first set of twins

33:42.480 --> 33:44.000
on the biggest day in football

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
than Super Bowl lead champs

33:48.000 --> 33:51.280
and identical twins Devin and Jason McCordy?

33:52.800 --> 33:54.800
We know parents don't get an off season.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.200
What?

33:57.200 --> 33:58.320
You heard me.

33:58.320 --> 33:58.880
Sorry, bud.

33:58.880 --> 33:59.600
Shit, man.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.160
As twins and parents ourselves,

34:02.160 --> 34:04.080
we're pumped to help honor-

34:05.120 --> 34:06.080
Wait, what's that?

34:06.080 --> 34:07.120
We can't win?

34:07.120 --> 34:07.620
Shit.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.240
Dang.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.320
We're pumped to help honor one lucky family

34:12.320 --> 34:14.560
welcoming twins on Super Bowl Sunday.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.400
We have awesome family memories

34:16.400 --> 34:17.600
of Pizza Hut growing up.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.960
Treasured Pizza Hut memories.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.960
Our dad's Pizza Hut would take us fishing.

34:26.640 --> 34:29.040
We've always been passionate about food,

34:29.040 --> 34:30.160
family, and football.

34:30.160 --> 34:31.280
Those last two make sense,

34:31.280 --> 34:33.280
but what does the first one have to do with Pizza Hut?

34:33.920 --> 34:37.200
It feels great to be a part of Super Bowl campaign

34:37.200 --> 34:38.720
that spotlights all three.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.120
So here's what you gotta do.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.680
Parents with twins born during the game

34:43.680 --> 34:46.640
simply need to post a photo to Twitter

34:46.640 --> 34:48.400
of their new baby,

34:48.400 --> 34:51.360
including exact types of birth

34:51.360 --> 34:56.480
with a hashtag P-H-T win to win

34:56.480 --> 35:00.640
and hashtag promotion and tag at Pizza Hut

35:00.640 --> 35:02.720
to be included for consideration.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.320
There will be people who will spend

35:11.600 --> 35:14.720
among the first moments of their child's life

35:14.720 --> 35:16.480
at least a few seconds.

35:17.040 --> 35:20.560
They will steal to stare at their phones to tweet.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.560
Hurry, doc, doc, give me that baby.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.320
Give me that baby.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.440
Don't wash it off.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.240
There's no time.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.960
You gotta be first.

35:29.600 --> 35:33.200
Honey, there will be people who will have

35:33.200 --> 35:37.040
some permutation of this fucking conversation.

35:37.040 --> 35:40.480
Honey, please keep the babies in

35:41.200 --> 35:42.800
for just another moment

35:43.600 --> 35:46.160
so I can tweet a picture of them

35:46.800 --> 35:50.080
to Pizza Hut after the game kicks off.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.280
Please, I beg of you.

35:51.280 --> 35:54.400
I gotta wait until I see that beautiful hog sack

35:54.400 --> 35:55.680
flying through the sky

35:56.400 --> 35:58.880
to indicate that football has begun

35:58.880 --> 36:02.080
and then, oh, babe, you're screaming so loud.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.600
I know, it's not good.

36:04.560 --> 36:08.240
Once that big, beautiful ball arcs through the air,

36:08.240 --> 36:10.080
then the baby can crowd

36:10.080 --> 36:14.000
and our life together can begin with this child.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.720
Now, if you'll excuse me,

36:16.720 --> 36:21.920
I'm going to tweet a picture of our infant to Pizza Hut.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.680
Don't forget the hashtags, honey, both of them.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.960
Fuck, fuck, that's dire.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.800
The least they could have done,

36:33.200 --> 36:35.200
the least Pizza Hut could have done

36:35.840 --> 36:40.320
is told us about this contest last April.

36:40.320 --> 36:40.800
Yes, thank you.

36:40.800 --> 36:45.360
So that willing couples can mark it to the day

36:45.360 --> 36:48.320
early May, pork down,

36:48.320 --> 36:50.640
drink whatever kind of tea you need to drink

36:50.640 --> 36:52.800
in order to make two of them happen

36:52.800 --> 36:55.440
and try to aim your shot then.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.240
You know what I mean?

36:56.240 --> 36:57.360
Because there's a lot of people who are like,

36:57.360 --> 36:59.280
oh, shit, my baby's due in like December.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.680
Ah, shit, my baby's not due until April.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.320
That sucks.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.200
Tell me last April so I can take a fucking,

37:05.200 --> 37:07.200
so I can line up my shot

37:07.200 --> 37:09.840
and throw that dart and see what happens.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.280
Can I tell you boys something?

37:11.280 --> 37:12.800
We're missing a huge thing here,

37:12.800 --> 37:15.040
which is, I don't know about you guys,

37:15.040 --> 37:18.080
but Baby Dot was a scheduled C-section.

37:18.080 --> 37:21.760
There is 1000% some parents out there going,

37:21.760 --> 37:25.920
would you happen to have any slots on Sunday?

37:25.920 --> 37:27.360
It's so grisly.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.280
Oh, I can't, I'm watching the big game.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.520
Shit, all the doctors are watching the big game.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.640
Yeah, but if you try to schedule it during the big game,

37:34.640 --> 37:35.920
the doctor would probably tell you,

37:35.920 --> 37:38.560
no, thank you, I'll be enjoying the big game.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.440
You can't schedule it.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.360
You have to trick me into coming

37:41.360 --> 37:42.960
with a series of riddles

37:42.960 --> 37:46.960
that lead me to the hospital and then and only then.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.280
What's that, you're throwing a party at this address

37:49.280 --> 37:50.480
and I just need to show up?

37:50.480 --> 37:52.000
Oh, wait a minute.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.160
Wait a second, there's an OR here.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.920
Not expecting twins?

37:57.920 --> 38:00.080
No worries, there's still a chance to be a winner.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.520
See if you can find another baby

38:01.520 --> 38:03.120
that looks just like your baby.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.840
I would argue that by not expecting twins,

38:07.840 --> 38:10.240
I am feeling pretty much like a winner already.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.440
Thank you very much, Pizza Hut.

38:11.440 --> 38:15.520
I don't need you to prop me up, but no worries.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.800
I will still have worries, Pizza Hut, thank you.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.880
Keep an eye on the Pizza Hut Twitter handle

38:20.880 --> 38:22.960
throughout the game on Super Bowl Sunday

38:22.960 --> 38:24.560
for a chance to win great prizes.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.080
We'll be giving away two babies.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.360
Yeah, keep an eye on, did you mean to say

38:29.360 --> 38:30.960
keep an eye on this fucking hashtag

38:30.960 --> 38:32.640
to see the adults that tweet a picture

38:32.640 --> 38:34.480
of their twins to Pizza Hut?

38:34.480 --> 38:37.760
Because I am gonna be doing that for sure.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.240
Hey, just real quick, just checking in, Pizza Hut.

38:40.240 --> 38:43.040
What if it's triplets, but I only take pictures

38:43.040 --> 38:44.000
with two of the babies?

38:46.320 --> 38:47.680
It's not called going for three,

38:47.680 --> 38:49.200
it's not their field goal challenge.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.340
Damn it.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.480
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

38:53.360 --> 38:54.080
Yeah, I like that.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.840
Here's one sent in by Emma Cant.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.640
Thank you, Emma, for also emailing us

38:58.640 --> 38:59.200
and letting us know about the-

38:59.200 --> 38:59.680
Wait.

38:59.680 --> 38:59.920
What?

39:00.960 --> 39:01.680
I think it's-

39:01.680 --> 39:02.720
No, it's not.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.200
No, I received an email saying,

39:05.200 --> 39:07.200
from Emma, thank you, Emma.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.440
Sorry, I goofed it up so bad so many times.

39:09.440 --> 39:12.240
It's from Yahoo Answers user Trickster, who asks,

39:13.440 --> 39:17.040
I was at a zoo today and I have my backpack open.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.080
When I got home, I realized a small animal

39:20.080 --> 39:21.440
had flown inside.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.880
Should I return it to the zoo?

39:23.440 --> 39:23.940
What?

39:24.800 --> 39:25.920
The subtext.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.800
The text of this question is that they have stolen

39:32.000 --> 39:34.640
an animal, a small bird.

39:34.640 --> 39:38.880
Or flown might mean, they may say like flown

39:38.880 --> 39:41.760
like when I say, ooh, that beautiful hog sack

39:41.760 --> 39:44.400
is flying through the sky after being thrown

39:44.400 --> 39:47.680
by, you know, Brett, Brett, whatever.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.360
Can we just for a moment agree

39:49.360 --> 39:50.800
that whoever wrote this question,

39:51.360 --> 39:55.040
not specifying the animal is perhaps-

39:55.040 --> 39:55.600
So wild.

39:55.600 --> 39:58.800
It's one of the weirdest parts about it.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.880
Like, if it's like, it's a squirrel or a sparrow,

40:02.880 --> 40:05.440
like, no, just let it go outside.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.920
But if you're like, it's a, I don't know,

40:07.920 --> 40:10.000
baby hippo or some shit, yeah.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.400
I think we've talked about this before.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.760
Correct me if I'm wrong.

40:13.760 --> 40:17.600
But when a bird, like a pigeon, flies into a zoo,

40:17.600 --> 40:20.160
a city zoo, and it's just like chilling,

40:20.160 --> 40:22.480
it's not part of zoo at that point, right?

40:23.840 --> 40:26.960
It has not become a temporary sort of floating exhibit

40:26.960 --> 40:27.840
for zoo.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.280
That has to be true.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.760
I mean, sometimes though, I do see kind of more like,

40:32.480 --> 40:34.400
there's a lot of zoos that I feel like

40:34.400 --> 40:36.880
just let their peacocks just wander around

40:36.880 --> 40:39.120
because they think they're not gonna hurt anybody,

40:39.120 --> 40:40.560
but they're so big.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.000
And when they spread their tails out,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.280
I feel like they're very scary

40:43.280 --> 40:44.560
and are capable of anything.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.000
There's gotta be a couple peacocks

40:46.000 --> 40:47.600
that just wandered in off the street.

40:47.600 --> 40:48.720
Are those zoo now?

40:49.600 --> 40:50.100
Huh.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.560
Now you say wandered in off the street,

40:52.560 --> 40:54.320
which would leave me to wonder,

40:54.320 --> 40:55.440
where is this zoo?

40:56.720 --> 40:58.880
Oh, New York City, baby.

40:58.880 --> 40:59.360
Home of peacocks.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.960
The big apple.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.200
The natural peacock home.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.760
So I stole a penguin from the zoo

41:05.760 --> 41:10.480
because I read a cool autobiography

41:10.480 --> 41:13.280
about a penguin haver that I really liked.

41:13.280 --> 41:16.480
And so I thought I would get one for myself.

41:16.480 --> 41:19.600
And how do I get it back into the zoo though?

41:19.600 --> 41:21.440
Because you know they check your bags.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.760
Here's what you're gonna have to do.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.280
You're gonna have to go back to the zoo and say,

41:27.280 --> 41:31.520
I would like to donate my animal to this zoo.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.600
And then they'll look at it and be like,

41:33.600 --> 41:34.640
that's little Jeremy.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.160
We know, we know this bird.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.920
We know, we're a zoo.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.160
We know which one is Jeremy.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.720
You have put a mustache on Jeremy.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.160
Yeah, we know him.

41:44.160 --> 41:44.640
We know him.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.360
Oh, that would be kind of fun actually to Jeremy

41:47.360 --> 41:52.800
to put like kind of sunglasses and fun shoes

41:53.440 --> 41:57.120
and a tank top on him and just walk him into the park

41:57.120 --> 41:59.200
and say he's your nephew.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.320
He's my nephew Jeremy.

42:00.320 --> 42:01.360
I want to show him the zoo.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.480
And then as soon as you're through the threshold,

42:04.480 --> 42:08.640
you 180 walk out and then it's just a small penguin boy

42:08.640 --> 42:10.080
waddling around the park.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.080
Somebody's gonna pick him up no question

42:12.080 --> 42:12.960
and get him back where he belongs.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.120
At the end of the day, he is still a penguin.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.960
Before you go into zoo,

42:16.960 --> 42:18.960
that's your nephew whose feet makes loud sounds

42:18.960 --> 42:19.440
when he walks.

42:19.440 --> 42:20.000
Yes.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.040
Although you did already pay the ticket price

42:23.600 --> 42:25.920
to get you and your nephew in.

42:25.920 --> 42:26.640
You could at least-

42:26.640 --> 42:27.760
Just enjoy your day.

42:27.760 --> 42:28.240
Just show them around.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.160
Just enjoy your day first.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.640
Show them around as the concession stands

42:32.640 --> 42:36.720
if they have any fish and go look at the tigers

42:36.720 --> 42:38.640
and be like, you'll never fuck with one of those.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.920
Jeremy, don't even trip on it.

42:39.920 --> 42:40.720
Well, that's a great point

42:40.720 --> 42:42.480
because that's the thing when you think about birds.

42:43.120 --> 42:45.040
Birds, when you're a pigeon, right?

42:45.680 --> 42:47.680
You might not be part of zoo,

42:47.680 --> 42:49.680
but you get to consume all of zoo.

42:49.680 --> 42:50.800
But when you're a penguin,

42:50.800 --> 42:53.040
can you imagine if a penguin,

42:53.040 --> 42:54.400
you just took it over and said,

42:54.400 --> 42:56.400
hey, look at that animal.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.080
And it was like, whoa, hey, elephants exist.

43:00.080 --> 43:00.720
What the fuck?

43:00.720 --> 43:01.440
How does it feel?

43:01.440 --> 43:07.760
I think that if I'm at zoo

43:09.520 --> 43:11.680
and I ask one of the animals

43:12.560 --> 43:14.320
if it wants to come home with me

43:15.120 --> 43:18.000
and it says it indicates that it does.

43:19.040 --> 43:19.600
Okay.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.640
I don't think it's right

43:20.640 --> 43:23.040
that the zoo would be able to stop it.

43:23.040 --> 43:23.920
I think that's fair.

43:24.720 --> 43:27.200
I think if I go to the penguin exhibit

43:27.200 --> 43:28.320
at the St. Louis Zoo

43:28.320 --> 43:30.800
and I walk up and those penguins are so close

43:30.800 --> 43:32.640
and I see a cute little rock hopper.

43:32.640 --> 43:33.680
He comes right up to me.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.680
He's like, and I'm like, oh shit.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.200
Oh shit.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.400
Are you feeling this?

43:38.400 --> 43:39.760
And the rock hopper is like,

43:40.800 --> 43:42.240
I'll be like, hey little bud,

43:43.120 --> 43:44.400
my house is not really set up for it,

43:44.400 --> 43:45.840
but I can get like a little freezer

43:45.840 --> 43:47.600
or I can like figure something out for you

43:47.600 --> 43:48.800
and keep you in fish.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.560
But I like, I'm feeling this

43:50.560 --> 43:52.320
and I know it's not make-believe.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.400
This is like the beginning of before sunset.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.000
Like you seem pretty chill.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.040
Do you want to come home with me?

43:57.920 --> 43:59.600
I should be able to take him home

43:59.600 --> 44:00.960
or else it's not zoo, is it?

44:00.960 --> 44:01.680
It's jail.

44:02.240 --> 44:02.800
That's fair.

44:03.440 --> 44:07.120
I think zoos should be more like a library

44:07.120 --> 44:08.320
than a zoo.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.720
Yeah, I'll return it.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.680
I will check this hyena out

44:15.280 --> 44:17.600
once I have tired of it

44:17.600 --> 44:18.720
and learned about it

44:18.720 --> 44:22.480
and grown with it, if I may.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.240
I will return it in the slot

44:24.240 --> 44:27.440
that you have provided outside for hyenas.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.440
Yeah, I'll put it right in the hyena hole.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.240
Now to be fair,

44:30.240 --> 44:31.680
you only use the hyena hole

44:31.680 --> 44:33.040
if it's after hours.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.560
And also if it's a hyena,

44:34.560 --> 44:36.480
don't put little Jeremy in the hyena hole.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.040
No, no, no, no.

44:37.040 --> 44:37.760
Oh my God, no.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.840
He's got his own little penguin boy hole.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.960
That's where he goes.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.720
Put him in where the penguin boys go.

44:42.720 --> 44:43.200
Yikes.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.360
I'm just saying,

44:45.360 --> 44:46.480
if nothing else,

44:46.480 --> 44:48.720
I should be allowed to check animals out of the zoo

44:49.600 --> 44:50.720
for Instagram.

44:51.280 --> 44:51.600
Okay.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.160
Interesting.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.040
This is actually,

44:53.040 --> 44:54.560
you should be allowed to.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.040
It's actually kind of a denial of your rights

44:57.040 --> 44:58.240
as an American

44:58.240 --> 45:00.560
that you can't check an animal.

45:00.560 --> 45:02.320
Hey, if the zoo, okay.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.440
If the zoo came to you and said,

45:05.440 --> 45:07.680
you have to check out an animal for a week.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.160
Again, Ernest,

45:10.960 --> 45:13.440
what animal would you check out for a week?

45:14.160 --> 45:16.720
You will be solely responsible for its care.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.960
I would take a fennec fox.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.920
You didn't even fucking hesitate

45:21.920 --> 45:25.520
to bring a carnivore into your home with an infant.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.520
It is smaller than buttercup.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.600
Buttercup is like,

45:29.600 --> 45:30.960
yeah, buttercup eats meat.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.080
You know what I mean?

45:32.080 --> 45:33.600
I'm not worried about her eating my baby.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.280
Well, I am, but only a little.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.760
So has the fennec fox been,

45:38.960 --> 45:39.680
let me think,

45:39.680 --> 45:42.640
bred genetically over millennia to not eat your baby?

45:42.640 --> 45:43.440
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.960
I didn't know you were a fan of eugenics.

45:46.480 --> 45:47.200
Whoa, Kate.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.560
No, absolutely not.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.240
No, incorrect.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.120
It's GMO.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.520
It's different.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.440
With foxes, it's more GMO.

45:55.440 --> 45:58.720
I'm reading here it eats mainly insects,

45:58.720 --> 46:00.320
small mammals, and birds.

46:01.520 --> 46:02.400
And shits.

46:02.400 --> 46:04.160
Well, you don't fucking know, do you?

46:04.160 --> 46:06.240
Okay, what's your answer then, smart-o?

46:07.280 --> 46:07.520
What?

46:08.560 --> 46:09.680
Obviously a fish.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.720
You put it in water and fuck off for a week.

46:12.720 --> 46:13.280
Who cares?

46:13.280 --> 46:14.720
Yeah, but what's the benefit?

46:15.760 --> 46:16.240
You're saying-

46:16.240 --> 46:16.880
What's your benefit?

46:16.880 --> 46:18.880
You're saying that this is like a punishment

46:18.880 --> 46:20.960
that the zoo is enforcing on you.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.760
I barely want my cats.

46:23.760 --> 46:25.920
Like, and I'm supposed to watch a fox?

46:26.480 --> 46:27.040
No way.

46:27.040 --> 46:27.680
Griffin, what animal would you-

46:27.680 --> 46:30.800
You guys are thinking of the least worst animal.

46:30.800 --> 46:31.840
And I like the least impact.

46:31.840 --> 46:32.560
That is what I'm doing.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.480
I'm trying to enrich my life.

46:34.480 --> 46:36.400
You know I'm taking home a Dunstan.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.240
Oh, boy.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.840
Griffin, that's gonna go so bad.

46:39.840 --> 46:44.720
Griffin, you have no idea the help that will be elation your house.

46:44.720 --> 46:49.680
Because I've got a Faye Dunaway that I need to perplex and bamboozle.

46:49.680 --> 46:51.680
Oh, Griffin McElroy.

46:51.680 --> 46:55.200
I've got a fucking Jason Alexander that I need to pull one on.

46:55.760 --> 47:00.240
There is no amount of setup you could do in your home to be ready for a Dunstan.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.320
Who will repair you for Dunstan?

47:02.320 --> 47:05.680
That's why the sequel is called Nothing Will Repair You For Dunstan.

47:05.680 --> 47:08.000
Nothing can stop this madness.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.240
Nothing Will Repair You For Dunstan is the sequel to Dunstan Checks In,

47:12.240 --> 47:14.800
which is for 90% of our audience.

47:14.800 --> 47:15.760
A movie about...

47:18.080 --> 47:19.120
I don't even want to say it.

47:19.120 --> 47:19.760
Can we have...

47:19.760 --> 47:22.960
Okay, can we have a word that's like both monkey and ape?

47:25.120 --> 47:26.720
So you don't have to fuck with it every time.

47:26.720 --> 47:27.600
We'll just say orangutan.

47:27.600 --> 47:28.960
He is an orangutan.

47:28.960 --> 47:32.000
So we'll just say that's every monkey and ape.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.880
That's gorillas, that's monkeys, we're good.

47:34.880 --> 47:41.120
But if I had a Dunstan, I could do funny pranks to Jason Alexander and Paul Reubens.

47:42.960 --> 47:45.760
And also, he could help me with stuff.

47:45.760 --> 47:46.560
Like your homework?

47:47.440 --> 47:48.720
No, Trav.

47:48.720 --> 47:50.080
I'm being earnest.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.920
He could help me with the cooking.

47:51.920 --> 47:53.040
He could help me clean up.

47:53.680 --> 47:53.920
Okay.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.400
He could help me hurt Faye Dunaway.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.680
If I wanted to...

48:01.680 --> 48:04.400
I'm not saying I want to hurt Faye Dunaway, but if I did,

48:04.400 --> 48:08.400
I think that this is the monkey slash ape slash whatever for the job.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.040
Oh, you know what?

48:09.040 --> 48:09.920
I changed my answer.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.480
You know what animal I would take home from the zoo?

48:13.280 --> 48:13.680
Man.

48:14.240 --> 48:17.360
So you'd take a human person home.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.680
I know my house is already set up for them.

48:19.680 --> 48:22.000
You know that this is not the zoo's policy.

48:22.640 --> 48:23.840
You're not going to fucking...

48:23.840 --> 48:25.600
They're not Rumpelstiltskin.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.320
You're not going to trick them with this bargain, okay?

48:28.880 --> 48:31.840
You have to take a real animal, not man.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.280
The most beautiful, perfect animal.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.720
You know what I'm going to do?

48:34.720 --> 48:37.760
I'm going to wait until one of you two picks an animal,

48:38.640 --> 48:43.760
and then I'm going to pick an animal that is effective against it.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.280
Oh, like a Pokemon.

48:45.280 --> 48:45.780
Okay.

48:45.780 --> 48:48.580
Yeah, say Justin gets a hippopotamus.

48:48.580 --> 48:49.080
Uh-huh.

48:50.020 --> 48:50.820
I'm going to...

48:50.820 --> 48:52.500
No, the problem is, Justin, if you get a fish,

48:52.500 --> 48:54.660
most animals are pretty effective against fish.

48:55.780 --> 48:57.300
Yeah, you just have them.

48:57.300 --> 48:58.340
You just have the fish.

48:59.460 --> 49:01.700
I want to make a quick announcement.

49:02.660 --> 49:06.260
Normally when we talk about animals, people who know more about animals

49:06.260 --> 49:11.220
than us decide to saddle up and come on over

49:11.220 --> 49:13.380
and tell us the things we said that are wrong.

49:13.380 --> 49:15.140
Please save your time.

49:15.140 --> 49:15.780
Unless...

49:15.780 --> 49:16.900
We know all the...

49:18.580 --> 49:20.340
Unless you're Jeff Corwin.

49:20.340 --> 49:22.180
Because I've been meaning to hang out with that fool.

49:23.220 --> 49:26.100
If Jeff, if you want to get at us with your animal info,

49:26.740 --> 49:29.620
or just Travis, I am not familiar with your stuff.

49:29.620 --> 49:32.820
Oh, Jeff Corwin had a great show on Disney when I was growing up.

49:32.820 --> 49:34.820
It taught me a lot about how to pick up snakes

49:36.020 --> 49:37.860
with a big hooked red low cane.

49:38.740 --> 49:43.060
I learned how to pick up snakes from mystery like a proper gentleman.

49:43.060 --> 49:46.420
He taught me about negging snakes.

49:48.980 --> 49:49.940
That's our show.

49:49.940 --> 49:51.860
Thank you so much for listening to the podcast.

50:39.540 --> 50:40.900
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

50:41.620 --> 50:42.740
