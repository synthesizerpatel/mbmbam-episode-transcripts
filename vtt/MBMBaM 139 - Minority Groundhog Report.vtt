00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:44.560 --> 00:48.240
Welcome my brothers, my brother, me, and my ship for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

00:48.240 --> 00:56.320
Justin McElroy, and we are all a fever for Super Bowl Sunday. Big, big game. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

00:56.320 --> 01:02.560
I'm sorry, big game Sunday. The commish, the commish might be listening, because god knows he's not

01:03.120 --> 01:08.800
busy governing the rules of the NFL, right guys? Nice, sit burn. Right, maybe governing them

01:09.520 --> 01:14.160
too much, depending on what the popular wisdom is that will make us seem plugged in. That

01:14.160 --> 01:20.960
touchdown in that Broncos game was highly suspect. I'm just excited, see a lot of people say they

01:20.960 --> 01:26.000
watch the Super Bowl for the commercials, I watch it for the concussions. I wanna see someone have

01:26.000 --> 01:30.480
some lasting damage. Sure. I watch it for those awesome plays where the dude can't get over the

01:30.480 --> 01:37.120
line so he dives over everyone. God those are awesome. I love those divers. I love the plays

01:37.120 --> 01:41.920
where a shirtless man runs out of the stands and has soy bomb written on his chest, and dances

01:41.920 --> 01:47.120
around midfield. That's a real shame that that is your wheelhouse Justin, because that's an

01:47.120 --> 01:51.680
incredibly rare, it's like, not a frequent occurrence. I watch the big game specifically

01:51.680 --> 01:58.400
for the Star Spangled Banner. Who's dropping it on us this year? I have no idea. So you don't

01:58.400 --> 02:03.520
really read up? No, I like to surprise myself with that. I try not, no spoilers, you know what I mean?

02:03.520 --> 02:08.800
They're gonna wheel out a small television of a pre-recorded video of Beyonce singing it.

02:08.800 --> 02:14.880
Now are we gonna have, I know that there's a tradition of sort of supplementary bowls. Oh

02:14.880 --> 02:20.720
yeah. There's of course the Bud Bowl. I'm way more excited for the Puppy Bowl. Oh the Puppy Bowl,

02:20.720 --> 02:23.840
I didn't know they were still doing that. Yeah they're doing it, and now they have, I think this

02:23.840 --> 02:28.560
year they have like Piglet Cheerleaders or some shit. They're really getting out of town. They're

02:28.560 --> 02:33.200
getting very commercial. Oh they've sold out. Yeah. I'm actually starting my own Puppy Bowl as

02:33.840 --> 02:40.080
part self-entertainment, part protest. Oh kind of like an underground Puppy Bowl. An underground

02:40.080 --> 02:45.760
Puppy Bowl. It's a lot more, like the puppies are more like into the sport, you know, they're more

02:45.760 --> 02:53.040
into the game of it, so they're a lot, they're way more violent. So an X, maybe like the XFL of Puppy.

02:53.040 --> 02:59.520
It's the XFL. So like arena Puppy Bowl. There's arena Puppy Bowl. I have a tiny, a tiny schnauzer

02:59.520 --> 03:07.280
called He Hate Me. He's in the mix. You're welcome XFL fans. XFL fans really loved that He Hate Me

03:07.280 --> 03:14.160
goof. And if you don't know about that one, google that. You're gonna love it. You're gonna love that

03:14.160 --> 03:22.080
guy. But I'm having a lot of problems with dog, dog fatalities. Griffin, can you describe to me

03:22.080 --> 03:27.040
sort of the, the, I'm sure you're, you're using different rules. Yeah it's more, it's sort of,

03:27.040 --> 03:31.520
describe to me the flow of play. Right, we're basically talking about a one-on-one sort of

03:31.520 --> 03:38.560
street ball, except they usually just ignore the ball altogether and just try to kill each other.

03:38.560 --> 03:43.920
And, but like in, I guess in their defense, like there's a bunch of people standing around in a

03:43.920 --> 03:50.400
circle screaming and throwing money. Griffin, Griffin, I'm sorry. Yeah, wait. It's, it sounds,

03:51.360 --> 03:56.560
sounds a lot like the love of the game, right? No, it sounds, it sounds, it sounds like you're

03:56.560 --> 04:01.680
hosting a dog fighting ring. It sounds like a dog fighting, yeah, a dog, is there a ball?

04:02.240 --> 04:06.560
There is a, there is a ball, but it's sort of like, it's a little off to the side,

04:06.560 --> 04:12.320
you know. Sure. Is, is there any kind of referee or like rule system? No, XFL baby, love of the

04:12.320 --> 04:20.800
game, love of the sport. Or maybe is there a ruff-ery? No, this is the kind of games you can

04:20.800 --> 04:25.360
expect from our hinted question. Did you guys introduce yourselves? I'm Travis McElroy. I'm

04:25.360 --> 04:33.360
Griffin, I'm Griffin McElroy. Please don't call any cops or animal cops or, I realize, like saying

04:33.360 --> 04:39.520
all these things out loud. Yeah, don't call the dog, please. Don't call dog the bunny, bunny hunter.

04:39.520 --> 04:45.840
Let's get into the advice. What do you mean dog the bounty hunter? Only specifically hunted dogs

04:46.640 --> 04:51.600
for sport. You mean the dog bounty hunter. It's just a switching of the article there.

04:51.600 --> 05:01.360
Boba Pat. Guys, Boba Pat. Boba Pat. Are we gonna give advice? I'd like to, yes. I hang out with

05:01.360 --> 05:06.240
this girl at my office. We take our lunches together and chat all day. She makes work fun.

05:06.240 --> 05:11.040
Lately, she keeps telling me how attracted she is to me and how it makes her feel awful because she

05:11.040 --> 05:17.760
has a boyfriend and now has suggested we stop hanging out all together. I like her. I think she's

05:17.760 --> 05:23.920
a cute girl, but I just want to keep on being office buddies. Oh my God. How do I get her to

05:23.920 --> 05:28.800
stop obsessing about how handsome she thinks I am? I don't know, but when you figure it out,

05:28.800 --> 05:35.040
you tell me, brother. Just joke around and have fun like the old days. That's from just friends

05:35.040 --> 05:40.400
in Florence, Kentucky. This guy sounds a lot like when you were in high school and everybody gets

05:40.400 --> 05:44.640
their physicals to join the wrestling team and the one guy comes back and is like, yeah,

05:45.360 --> 05:53.200
apparently the doctor said my wiener is abnormally enormous. Sure, pal. Sure, friend. Too big for

05:54.240 --> 06:00.320
contention. It's in a whole nother weight class. I don't know. He said I couldn't do wrestling time.

06:00.320 --> 06:06.640
I think if you really want to get serious about this, you got to go full man in the iron mask.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.720
Yeah, that's really the deal. I was sitting here thinking, I'm glad you said it first Griffin,

06:14.240 --> 06:18.560
because it almost seemed too obvious, but yeah, definitely man in the iron mask,

06:19.440 --> 06:24.080
lock your face in sort of a prison of iron. Sure. I don't remember man in the iron mask,

06:24.080 --> 06:28.880
but I think it was because the queen was sexually attracted to Leo DiCaprio because why wouldn't she

06:28.880 --> 06:35.440
be? And so the king was like, I got to lock it up. Got to lock that sweet face up. And he did,

06:35.440 --> 06:41.680
locked it right up. And yeah, because they couldn't handle his beauty. Made him look like

06:42.640 --> 06:47.440
Ultraman a little bit. I feel like they were mixing their time periods a little bit.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.160
Yeah, it got a little mixed up. I did like it when he got his repulsor raised and started

06:54.160 --> 07:00.320
legways to the bad guys in France. Yeah. That was pretty cool. The man in the iron man. Yeah.

07:02.160 --> 07:09.120
I don't understand this question. Well, see, she's into him, but he's just not that into her.

07:09.120 --> 07:14.880
But is she really into him or is this like, I'm really bored at the office and you're kind of cute.

07:14.880 --> 07:21.360
It sounds like she wants to get a Jim Pam thing going, but her heart's not fully in it.

07:21.360 --> 07:25.840
She still loves Roy. Giving you the half Jim Pam. And that's-

07:25.840 --> 07:31.200
Because I find that that kind of thing doesn't work when you blatantly spell it out to the other

07:31.200 --> 07:35.760
person. Like, listen, I'm just going to lay all my cards on the table. I like you. I think you're

07:35.760 --> 07:40.320
really handsome. I've got a boyfriend. I don't know. Is it, is it not? We'll find out.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.680
We'll find out on this climactic season finale of The Shitty Office.

07:45.680 --> 07:51.760
The problem, the problem with your situation is you're trying to push the story forward too fast.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.800
She's wanting that like season six Jim and Pam. Oh, right. And you're still in that season one

07:56.800 --> 08:02.560
Jim and Pam where you may not even yet realize that she's the girl for you. Right. Right. Whatever

08:02.560 --> 08:06.640
you do, don't get fast forwarded. Don't get the season eight Jim and Pam where it's like,

08:07.200 --> 08:12.400
is there a new love interest? Of course there's not. Of course there's not. I'm a fucking adult

08:12.400 --> 08:17.680
the office. Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Do you think you could just really lay it out for

08:17.680 --> 08:23.920
it? Like, listen, I appreciate you think I'm handsome, but let me tell you this ain't never

08:23.920 --> 08:29.360
gonna happen. It's never gonna happen between you and me. Can you sing a few verses of never

08:29.360 --> 08:34.080
gonna get it except I guess change the words to never gonna happen as just suggested.

08:34.080 --> 08:44.000
Never gonna happen. I need you guys on harmony. Never gonna happen. I can edit it. I can edit

08:44.000 --> 08:48.400
it in. You know what I always hated about that song? Sorry to completely change. Didn't you guys

08:48.400 --> 08:52.720
hate it when like they edit the song to make it sound like they were cutting back to the radio

08:52.720 --> 08:56.880
and then they would bring it back for like another like another stanza? You remember that?

08:57.520 --> 09:02.800
Yeah, I got excited because like I always feel whatever an invoke song ends, I always get a

09:02.800 --> 09:08.480
mild depression when I think, oh God, I can't believe it's over already. I know. And then wait,

09:08.480 --> 09:13.680
it's not. I know. It really ruins your expectations for all other radio music though, right?

09:14.480 --> 09:19.840
Right. Just wait, it's coming back. It's gonna come back on. Hotel California. Hotel California

09:19.840 --> 09:24.800
goes off and you're like, wait, it's coming back. I know it. Encore. Ah, fuck. Here comes the drop.

09:24.800 --> 09:30.000
The Hotel California drop. I can honestly say that no one has ever listened to Hotel California and

09:30.000 --> 09:34.240
wished it would come back on. Oh man, I wish there was more of that Eagles song. I mean,

09:34.240 --> 09:38.160
because it's good news for whoever feels that way. You could just switch to a different channel. And

09:38.160 --> 09:45.840
hey, it's on there too. Yeah, it's probably on somewhere else. You know, normally I push an

09:45.840 --> 09:53.040
honest discussion on this sort of thing, but I think you have to be respectful of the fact that

09:53.040 --> 09:59.920
if this woman is into you, then it may be hard for her to just do the friend thing. I mean,

09:59.920 --> 10:04.400
that may not be easy for her. Yeah, it's fine. We don't usually get the question from this side.

10:04.400 --> 10:09.440
You know, we get a lot of that, like the person telling the question asker that they are not

10:09.440 --> 10:16.560
interested and just want to be friends. I think that when that happens, like you got to respect

10:16.560 --> 10:25.040
it and to say, hey, drop it and just be cool again. That's kind of being a little bit inconsiderate of

10:25.040 --> 10:29.360
her feelings. You know, she's trying to do the right thing and say, I've got a boyfriend. I'm

10:29.360 --> 10:33.920
attracted to you. This isn't right. We shouldn't hang out anymore. And for you to try to push it,

10:33.920 --> 10:39.040
I think there's a little callous. So maybe just give it some time. And as with most things,

10:39.040 --> 10:43.520
eventually it'll get back to a place where you guys can probably hang out. The good news about

10:43.520 --> 10:48.160
the human heart is that if she tries to deny herself, you, you're going to become more

10:48.160 --> 10:55.360
attractive than you could have ever possibly been before. You'll be a tantalizing, forbidden fruit

10:55.360 --> 11:01.760
hanging from the branch of the HR department. And she has, and you know that that is a feeling

11:01.760 --> 11:06.960
everyone has always wanted to have. Yeah. Give this, give this thing six more months of you

11:06.960 --> 11:12.880
ice it, putting it directly on ice. And then after those six months coming in your bicycle shorts,

11:12.880 --> 11:18.240
she will literally explode. She will literally, she will literally disintegrate at the subatomic

11:18.240 --> 11:23.760
level. Yeah. And if all else fails, you could maybe go with like a really overly sculpted

11:23.760 --> 11:28.000
facial hair and just really turn her right off the whole side. Oh yeah. Like the guy from

11:28.000 --> 11:34.880
hunger games. That would be great. Just stop bathing. Just really, why don't you just garbage

11:34.880 --> 11:42.320
yourself up? Like real good. Next time she's like, listen, you're too attractive. Next time

11:42.320 --> 11:48.080
she says you're too attractive and she can't, she just can't help herself. Have her put her hand

11:48.880 --> 11:54.800
on a chair and then you sit on the chair and you fart on the top of her hand. And then you

11:54.800 --> 12:04.560
put on a trilby. Then you're done. You are out. This is my fart cap. This is your fart

12:04.560 --> 12:14.480
hat. Do you enjoy my trilby? My overly sculpted facial hair? We are in love. No? Bye. And then

12:14.480 --> 12:20.480
you're fine. You can be friends again. I guess that will work. That would work. You'd have a

12:20.480 --> 12:28.720
crazy story to tell all your other friends. Did you bring in a yahoo answer questions? I brought

12:28.720 --> 12:35.920
a small satchel. Open up that drawstring. Let me pull open this drawstring and reach deep down.

12:36.640 --> 12:44.320
This one is actually surprisingly pretty germane. It was sent in by Ira Ray. Are you Ira Ray? Who

12:44.320 --> 12:49.200
wants to know? I like sometimes you give us both parts. Sometimes you just give us who wants to

12:49.200 --> 12:54.320
know. If I thought you guys would give me who wants to know, I would stop delivering it. But

12:54.320 --> 13:01.440
I know it'll never happen. Maybe maybe it's Christmas. I would also like to point out from

13:01.440 --> 13:06.160
our emails this week how many people are utterly confused when Justin does that. Some people don't

13:06.160 --> 13:10.400
get it. Some people love it. My friend Anna here here in Austin listens. It's her favorite thing

13:10.400 --> 13:16.880
in the show, which makes me question everything about her. And our show. It's asked by yahoo

13:16.880 --> 13:25.520
answers user Ahmed who asks what to get for ex-co-workers for Valentine's Day. I left the

13:25.520 --> 13:29.200
company a month ago and want to surprise them by sending them something. What is a good surprise

13:29.200 --> 13:33.520
gift for three female friends I used to work with? They are between 25 and 35. Please nothing

13:33.520 --> 13:39.680
too suggestive. If they're your former co-workers and you get them a Valentine's Day present,

13:39.680 --> 13:44.720
trust me, it will be a surprise gift. Yeah. And it will be suggestive too. Unless it's like

13:44.720 --> 13:53.200
erasers like these. Why did we get shit from you? Some silly bands. Why did Tony send us some shit?

13:53.200 --> 13:58.880
Like I don't even remember that the shape of that dude's face because I don't. I hardly knew it when

13:58.880 --> 14:04.320
we worked together and that was nigh upon a month ago. I don't care if you send them a shitty cut

14:04.320 --> 14:11.200
out Valentine that says like you complete bees and then there's a picture of bees. Yeah. Uh,

14:11.200 --> 14:15.360
they still are going to think that you're upset. I don't care if you send them a Ziploc bag full

14:15.360 --> 14:22.560
of bees. I don't care. You come into the office covering your bees. And then on the bag you've

14:22.560 --> 14:29.360
scrawled out let's be buzz like buds so that people get. You really missed it because you

14:29.360 --> 14:34.960
could have had bee in there and it would have been let's be but you blew it. Let's be buzz.

14:34.960 --> 14:42.240
Be mine. And then like your platonic intention couldn't be any more clear or thorough and they

14:42.240 --> 14:49.600
would still think you're trying to fuck. Yeah. I think the idea. Will you be my honey? Ah damn it.

14:49.600 --> 14:54.640
That was nice. Really good. I think the idea. Be mine. Okay stop. You're drunk on power. I want to

14:54.640 --> 15:01.120
dip my proboscis deep in your stamen and suck up the sweet humors of your your sweet leaves.

15:01.120 --> 15:08.160
As friends. As buds. As buzz though. I think that getting Valentine's Day presents for anyone that

15:08.160 --> 15:14.240
is not your significant other is just stupid. Right. I think back to when I was in elementary

15:14.240 --> 15:23.680
school and how you get valentines for everybody in your class. Like teacher, bro friends, like

15:23.680 --> 15:30.800
ladies that you are interested in but are clearly so so so far outside of your of your price range

15:30.800 --> 15:35.600
because they already had their braces and you are still coming out. Such a minefield. You have to

15:35.600 --> 15:42.240
consider everyone has a different message on it and they're in varying states of plutonicness.

15:42.240 --> 15:49.040
Right. So you have to weigh like is who is going to get this card and then you have like and then

15:49.040 --> 15:53.920
and then you have like and then so so once you get that sorted out who's gonna get the appropriate

15:53.920 --> 15:59.520
message. You fuck up. Then you have like 20 cards on your desk of like signals. Right. Just sort

15:59.520 --> 16:04.880
through. You switch. You have mild ass burgers. You switch one envelope. You switch one envelope

16:04.880 --> 16:13.440
of your Spider-Man themed valentines and give like weirdo Barry in the corner the one that

16:13.440 --> 16:19.280
has Mary Jane on it saying like looking good tiger. You're done. You're done. Sorry. Change goals.

16:20.160 --> 16:25.920
You are done. Become a Catholic. Go to the Catholic school. You're done. Change your name.

16:25.920 --> 16:32.160
Fugue state. Pack them up. Move them away. You are donezo. Frozen in carbonite. Wait for a hundred

16:32.160 --> 16:37.040
years. Thaw you out and then and only then can you start to rebuild your life. Hopefully. Until

16:37.040 --> 16:44.000
until the creepy kid's grandson remembers you as that guy. The legacy of your ultimate shame will

16:44.000 --> 16:50.160
will follow you through generations. Legend tells of a young man he handed out the wrong valentine

16:50.160 --> 16:59.040
and then disappeared into the mist. I don't I do not envy this dude or anybody who feels

16:59.600 --> 17:05.600
like they have to buy a valentine's day present for anybody other than like I only buy a valentine's

17:05.600 --> 17:13.520
day gift for one person my fiance my finance and like that is already like puts a crippling amount

17:13.520 --> 17:18.560
of pressure on me if I had to double that or apparently is this person thinks quadruple that

17:18.560 --> 17:27.360
like I was gonna say the issue here is that this gentleman is not being honest with himself

17:27.360 --> 17:31.920
because I'd be willing to bet if this dude's wanting to buy presents for these three ladies

17:31.920 --> 17:37.040
he is in love with at least one of them. I don't know. Yeah right he's trying to lay down smokescreen

17:37.040 --> 17:43.360
but he probably doesn't even realize it himself. All right let me free everybody up from uh some

17:44.640 --> 17:48.160
some of the pressure here. You know what Sidney and I get each other from time to time every year?

17:48.160 --> 17:53.120
What? What's that? Nothing. You know why? It's not because we don't love each other it's because I've

17:53.120 --> 17:59.840
already given herself I've already given to Sidney my time and my consideration. Yeah. I've given her

17:59.840 --> 18:04.720
my life and your body as the greatest gift of all. Well my body my best years. You've given her your

18:04.720 --> 18:12.480
physical love? I gave her my my physical sexual peak uh to our marriage and honestly I I we make

18:12.480 --> 18:17.840
each other feel like we love each other every day. Yeah. I don't wait for a dumb ass like thing. I

18:17.840 --> 18:23.120
buy Teresa flowers like randomly throughout the course of the year I don't need I don't need like

18:23.120 --> 18:28.640
a day to be like hey dummy that's great sweet today. Hey you know what guys I'm actually thinking

18:28.640 --> 18:32.400
about uh getting up in the attic and getting the Christmas tree out again. What the fuck are you

18:32.400 --> 18:38.320
talking about? Love should be a once a once a year thing. Why why can't we give presents and have love

18:38.320 --> 18:42.400
for each other every day? Why do we have to wait for Christmas? It's the middle of September so

18:42.400 --> 18:47.840
where are the Easter eggs? Good luck. Griffin are you suggesting that we should only be allowed to

18:47.840 --> 18:55.280
love each other? You should withhold your affection until one day. Some kind of horrible 1984-esque

18:55.280 --> 19:00.800
world in which somebody was holding hands and so they had to be re-educated. Are you saying Justin

19:00.800 --> 19:05.360
that we should be able to eat turkey and stuffing whenever the fuck we want? No we do it on

19:05.360 --> 19:10.240
Thanksgiving because that's when you do that thing because it's when the Indians and Pilgrims got

19:10.240 --> 19:19.280
together and sorted it out. The I think we stopped celebrating it on the day when we saw a uh a little

19:19.280 --> 19:28.080
person stripper at uh Southern Exposure and we kind of knew after that like well we were not

19:28.080 --> 19:32.640
gonna top this. She actually had one move where she painted her boobs and then pressed her boobs

19:32.640 --> 19:38.960
on a shirt and then sold the shirt. I need to know. I'm hoping for gas money home that's the only thing.

19:38.960 --> 19:46.320
I need to delve into this. Did you go to Southern Exposure knowing that there was going to be a

19:46.320 --> 19:51.680
a little person stripper there or was it a pleasant surprise? It was a pleasant surprise

19:51.680 --> 19:56.960
Trav. We just happened to go on Valentine's Day because what else are you gonna do? I'm sure it

19:56.960 --> 20:02.560
was full of other loving couples. Celebrate your love and watch Love Actually and eat chocolate

20:02.560 --> 20:07.760
and look at the flowers. Love Actually is a Christmas movie? Oh it's a two times a year movie Justin.

20:09.440 --> 20:16.240
Unlike Love which is apparently 365 days a year. I know I'm setting the bar so high. Do you think

20:16.240 --> 20:20.720
if they allowed prisoners to have conjugal visits every day that jail jail would just be like I'm

20:20.720 --> 20:26.080
going to jail cool because I can fuck every day if I want. It's you know what I've just been making

20:26.080 --> 20:31.280
it once a day and once a year that makes it special. Yeah they should make everybody only

20:31.280 --> 20:38.240
have conjugal visits on February 14th once annually because can you imagine the smell?

20:38.240 --> 20:47.440
You could hear you could hear the love sounds down the street. Oh my god sounds like a mop

20:47.440 --> 20:52.480
factory in there. Your your windows would shake like someone next door was listening to mystical

20:52.480 --> 21:01.680
it would just be just a pounding resounding bass of incarcerated meat slapping against freedom.

21:01.680 --> 21:10.080
Oh I I've had a brainstorm. Hit me. What if so Valentine's Day February 14th is you know the

21:10.080 --> 21:18.640
day of love six months later the day of hate. Why? Wait a minute what? Right no that's just the day

21:18.640 --> 21:24.720
of just like going up to the person you dislike at work and be like hey I hate you. Let's air in

21:24.720 --> 21:30.560
his mouth you stink. I think you're a big old stinky Pete and I don't like you anymore. So

21:30.560 --> 21:36.960
are you saying on August 18th every year we should just be like hey buddy fuck you. Yeah but then

21:36.960 --> 21:40.400
that's gonna get confusing because then you have those three people that you used to work with a

21:40.400 --> 21:45.600
month ago that you fucking hate and you don't know how to like send them dookie I guess. I don't know

21:45.600 --> 21:48.880
what the I don't know what the protocol is for this holiday that you've just invented. What's

21:48.880 --> 21:54.480
the proper amount of dookie to send to someone you don't work with anymore? How many can cups

21:54.480 --> 22:01.200
are out? How do you translate uh liquid cups of dookie to solid dookie? What's the measurement

22:01.200 --> 22:06.080
conversion? Could we go a single week without talking about converting solid dookie to liquid

22:06.080 --> 22:14.160
dookie? Here's another question. A few months ago I rented out my second bedroom to a friend of mine.

22:14.160 --> 22:18.960
He has since moved out but has left some things behind. He asked if I was interested in a few

22:18.960 --> 22:24.560
items. I acquiesced because hey new couch. The issue stems from the rest of what he left behind.

22:24.560 --> 22:29.840
Several boxes, DVD and the like, musical instruments, clothes, and shoes. I've texted him several times

22:29.840 --> 22:35.360
in the past three months to pick up what he wants as I have other designs on uses for that bedroom.

22:35.360 --> 22:41.840
And in parentheses here it says not sex dungeon which is the surest way of convincing me that you

22:41.840 --> 22:47.200
are in fact making a sex dungeon. I would feel shitty giving him an ultimatum and I don't want

22:47.200 --> 22:53.360
to do something to damage our friendship such as simply selling or pitching all of it. But I also

22:53.360 --> 22:57.600
don't want to feel as though my hospitality has been taken advantage of. That's from Tumultuous

22:57.600 --> 23:05.760
in Toronto. Um your hospitality is being taken advantage of. That's precisely what's happening.

23:06.320 --> 23:11.440
You have nailed it. Yeah you you really read this you read this room. I don't understand like what

23:11.440 --> 23:16.560
he's left all this shit in your house is yours now. Is that the is that fucking sell it? Just

23:16.560 --> 23:21.440
what are you talking about? Hey my friend gave me a bunch of shit and I don't know what to do

23:21.440 --> 23:27.920
with it. Just like sell it or use it. There's or throw it away. I feel like if it is a concern

23:27.920 --> 23:32.880
it is completely is not an ultimatum and not well I mean it is but it's not a horrible thing to do

23:32.880 --> 23:38.960
to call him and say hey man I really need this room if you don't want this stuff I'm going to

23:38.960 --> 23:45.440
get rid of it. I'm sorry this is crazy if you move you take your shit with you if you leave it behind

23:45.440 --> 23:51.920
then it's he didn't pay for storage services with his shitty Davenport okay if you left it behind

23:51.920 --> 23:58.080
it's it's he has no place. Have you guys met my friend shitty Davenport? Did you hear? Are you guys

23:58.080 --> 24:03.200
going to the gas light tonight? I hear shitty Davenport. Um you know I had a roommate that

24:03.760 --> 24:10.640
she decided that to move out and like her sister and her were getting an apartment and she ended up

24:10.640 --> 24:18.960
just leaving a bunch of shit behind and so I threw it away. It's that easy. It's it's a super easy

24:18.960 --> 24:27.520
thing to do. Throw it away. Step two relax. It drives me it drives me up a goddamn like I've

24:27.520 --> 24:32.800
worked so hard to accrue the things that I've accrued I would never just leave it in somebody's

24:32.800 --> 24:39.200
house and then write a box of DVDs that's what the hell that represents thousands of dollars in

24:39.200 --> 24:45.840
value that you've accrued to like divest unless you're going full-blown divestation of your shit

24:45.840 --> 24:53.600
so that you can you know study yoga in on some mountain in a country leaving it all behind man

24:53.600 --> 25:00.640
yeah like my stuff I'm a yogi now doesn't make sense to me I like musical instruments what the

25:00.640 --> 25:08.480
hell pretty much all my actions anymore like are based around getting physical objects out of my

25:08.480 --> 25:15.920
home like I just don't want things here that don't make me happy and I worked or I used to be really

25:15.920 --> 25:22.320
bad about accumulation like I I used to when I was in high school I would call like when when the

25:22.320 --> 25:26.320
internet was first uh kicking off there used to be a lot of places where you could give them like

25:26.320 --> 25:31.120
your mailing address information stuff like that and they would send you like free shit so you get

25:31.120 --> 25:37.120
like a free I don't know fanny pack or stickers or sample of detergent or whatever and I would

25:37.120 --> 25:44.240
like sign up for all that shit and now I'm doing basically the opposite where I I will mail my

25:44.240 --> 25:49.680
things to you if you want them like I hope for free I just do you want my things sure we all do

25:49.680 --> 25:55.360
the worst thing you could do to me is leave a box in my home that's like you these aren't yours

25:56.000 --> 26:01.200
and you can't throw them away so just handle this what is your friend saying when you call him

26:01.200 --> 26:07.600
him like oh yeah all right talk to you later oh I have stuff there cool

26:09.280 --> 26:14.080
I don't like you need to come get your box oh you don't go call your friend say come get your shit

26:14.080 --> 26:19.760
or I'm throwing it away love you happy valentine's day click life isn't as hard as you make it

26:20.400 --> 26:26.720
you just call him and say you're just no don't call him wait till trash day after the trash

26:26.720 --> 26:31.760
man leave you put all of it in a trash bag and put it outside and you call him and go

26:34.560 --> 26:39.040
like I'm 24 and then he just and then he has to come get it and it's the right sequence of

26:39.040 --> 26:45.440
clock is very exciting for him it's thrilling for you because it's fucking uh Ramones poster

26:45.440 --> 26:52.640
isn't in your den anymore right could you I have a good idea is if you why don't you have a yard sale

26:52.640 --> 26:57.920
or like a Jeff sale because you're selling all of Jeff's things and then you take the proceeds from

26:57.920 --> 27:01.680
the Jeff sale and you take him out to a nice dinner and then afterwards you'd be like I got

27:01.680 --> 27:07.200
the check and he's like that's nice of you it's actually it's actually nice of you let me put it

27:07.200 --> 27:14.240
put it this way I I'm tipping him your freaks and geeks DVD set so pick up that knife and fork and

27:14.240 --> 27:20.400
carve off a piece of that tuba that you used to have and dip it dip it in that copy of freaks and

27:20.400 --> 27:24.720
geeks and eat it you're gonna love it this can you use the musical instrument he left to write

27:24.720 --> 27:30.160
him a little song about how you sold all those things I think you'd appreciate that I actually

27:30.160 --> 27:35.440
sold your tuba to buy this tuba so I could write you this song this smaller shittier tuba

27:35.440 --> 27:51.360
your tuba it's a gift of the magi right uh let's go to the money

27:51.360 --> 27:57.920

police headquarters that they've struck again the partners in butt crime they've stolen another one

30:07.520 --> 30:12.880
I uh I want to I want to actually uh wanted to I know we've only had great things to say

30:12.880 --> 30:18.880
about extremistraints.com by the way if you go to extremistraints.com it's a a massive adult

30:18.880 --> 30:24.960
toy store super site if you use a coupon code MIDDLELIST you can save 20 percent um but I I

30:24.960 --> 30:32.720
never I I I never thought it would come to this but I actually I have beef with uh extremistraints.com

30:33.280 --> 30:39.200
uh our sort of uh our our relationship is is a partnership it's built on the fact that

30:39.200 --> 30:43.840
we offer very different services but really not that not that different though because I like

30:43.840 --> 30:51.440
that all of our advice is aimed at helping you get fucked like ultimately everything we tell

30:51.440 --> 30:56.640
you is aiming towards that end goal that's the where yeah that's the end goal here's the here's

30:56.640 --> 31:02.320
the problem though I'm looking uh at their uh they're starting to infringe a little bit I'm

31:02.320 --> 31:08.480
looking at their selection of gags oh no now this is too bad this is unfortunate first off

31:08.480 --> 31:15.840
they have ball gags yeah okay that's kind of our thing but go on and then they have very clearly

31:15.840 --> 31:22.800
uh infringing penis gags and that's like a half of our basically yeah that's like 98 percent of our

31:23.680 --> 31:32.720
of our of our gags and then perhaps most upsettingly they have a category called

31:32.720 --> 31:40.880
pony bit gags and I'm sorry guys that's like practically TM all right that's kind of our thing

31:41.440 --> 31:48.160
is pony gags like the pony bits and horse bits like that's kind of our shtick like what what

31:48.160 --> 31:52.880
I'm glad they don't have ghost gags I know because then it would be the then I think we would we

31:52.880 --> 31:58.960
would have to get into some lawsuit territory um if I were to add a great cross-branding idea

31:58.960 --> 32:08.960
yeah okay I'm gonna say three words Bob Ball gags oh no I don't think so I don't want this I don't

32:08.960 --> 32:13.440
think uh my brother my brother and me officially announced that Bob Ball would want to put his name

32:13.440 --> 32:19.440
or branding on something like that I'm just saying um we're gonna be rich if I'm gonna call beef out

32:19.440 --> 32:24.160
on Extreme Restraints my only beef with them is that now in Google Chrome whenever I'm in the

32:24.160 --> 32:30.800
search or address bar and I press the letter e Extreme Restraints is what autofills that is how

32:30.800 --> 32:36.640
frequently I have visited this website that is convenience Griffin that is that you are right

32:36.640 --> 32:43.520
about that so head to ExtremeRestraints.com it's with an a uh not an x as you might actually

32:43.520 --> 32:49.200
there's actually a couple e's in there yeah there's a few e's in there it's a popular letter uh and

32:49.200 --> 32:55.120
head there and use the coupon code MIDDLIST to save 20 uh oh good news guys if you forget the

32:55.120 --> 33:02.480
it's still ExtremeRestraints.com so you are fine uh Griffin how about another yahoo sure this one

33:02.480 --> 33:08.000
was sent in by Earl Parsons thanks Earl it's by yahoo answers user Harry who asks is it possible

33:08.000 --> 33:21.920
to fall in love on yahoo answers bye everyone are there answers um there are there are um a lot of

33:21.920 --> 33:28.240
people saying some pretty disparaging things to Harry I'll be honest with you not a good day for

33:28.240 --> 33:34.480
Harry not a good environment I think Harry by asking this question was sort of casting a net

33:34.480 --> 33:46.480
of sorts a sexual net available on Extreme Restraints um and I think that he did not get

33:46.480 --> 33:52.080
the responses that he was looking for yeah but at the same time it can't happen that's how

33:52.640 --> 33:59.920
I I'm pretty sure that's how Manteo found his suitor yeah they seem to be very happy and also

33:59.920 --> 34:07.920
it's worth noting I have not read anything for the past three weeks so the love story of the

34:07.920 --> 34:13.680
sports love story of the decade the sports love story yeah right it's like Brian's song but with

34:13.680 --> 34:23.760
a real woman um one in six marriages guys one in six yeah Justin that's how you met online that's

34:23.760 --> 34:29.520
how you met Sydney right is that you asked um why the chess pieces in chess were called what they

34:29.520 --> 34:36.080
were called and she made it like shut the fuck up asshole yeah because she's on yahoo troll troll

34:36.080 --> 34:43.520
lol lol troll troll lol lol lol and then which as we all know is internet code I love you you

34:43.520 --> 34:52.560
voted that as she called me a chess bag with four g's I knew then I knew that it was real that was

34:52.560 --> 35:01.440
real love um and then you voted that as top answer and it was top answer that was my way of saying

35:01.440 --> 35:07.440
hello and that was like that was like your guys as you wish that was the moment um it's probably

35:07.440 --> 35:12.400
happened right yeah I mean I would just everything is happening it seemed I would assume that this is

35:12.400 --> 35:17.680
not an exception it seems like an awfully circuitous like why like a dating site alone is

35:17.680 --> 35:24.480
like hard enough to find somebody who isn't awful isn't the worst and those have all these like

35:24.480 --> 35:30.560
heuristics built into them to help you find what you're looking for yahoo answers is like a fucking

35:30.560 --> 35:38.080
masquerade ball like there's no way of knowing what's going on it's a lot more like chaos theory

35:38.080 --> 35:43.120
you know what I mean the problem that this question asker how they were they were almost too

not believe me when I first told her I couldn't remember the last time I cried but now that we've

37:52.880 --> 37:59.200
been going out for almost two years she's insisting she needs to see me shed some tears it's not like

37:59.200 --> 38:03.840
I don't feel the same emotions as her it's just that nothing has brought me over the edge in at

38:03.840 --> 38:09.680
least 10 years and even though she says she wants to see me cry I feel like subconsciously it could

38:09.680 --> 38:16.080
turn her off do I suck it up and cry for her or do I keep my dry street going that's from

38:16.080 --> 38:21.200
Krusty Aiden Colorado whatever you do if you haven't cried in 10 years make sure that when

38:21.200 --> 38:26.560
you do it no one is standing directly in front of you oh man like the fire hose in UHF well not only

38:26.560 --> 38:34.400
that but you are gonna be so bad at it oh my god yeah your face is gonna look like John Mayer during

38:34.400 --> 38:43.920
a solo I here's the thing I got a solution for you just watch Iron Giant yeah right that's what I

38:43.920 --> 38:51.520
was gonna say yeah just watch Iron Giant and you'll cry it'll be it'll be a masculine a masculine

38:51.520 --> 38:56.720
uh tear fest I promise so there's a different and put it on lube there is a difference between

38:56.720 --> 39:04.080
like a masculine like a gentleman's cry you know what I mean uh-huh it's it's deep the base the base

39:04.080 --> 39:13.600
is a little bit stronger it's more of like oh no you actually say oh no just over and over oh no

39:14.640 --> 39:20.240
oh no you are going here's the thing I have to assume if you haven't cried in 10 years you've

39:20.240 --> 39:26.320
been burying some things like once you turn on those tears out there you may just be like

39:26.320 --> 39:31.840
digging back and back and back like deeper and deeper like I gotta see you my geometry exam

39:31.840 --> 39:37.200
you know what I you hear about Stephen yeah he's never not crying now you know my jam cries all

39:37.200 --> 39:42.160
the time my jam is like when I have to cry at something like the last episode of Downton Abbey

39:42.160 --> 39:47.920
um I don't make any noise or like move my face at all I just let the tears just sort of like fall

39:48.560 --> 39:54.800
down my cascading completely still stoic Native American looking out at a bunch of trash face

39:54.800 --> 40:01.120
like yeah so proud and I'm gonna be honest with you guys this may surprise no one I cry at like

40:01.120 --> 40:06.000
everything yeah dude yeah I'm a big old I was actually I was literally talking about this last

40:06.000 --> 40:10.560
night because it like uh some sort of Disney commercial with Wally was in it and we were all

40:10.560 --> 40:14.400
talking about how we all cried when we watched Wally I remember when I watched Wally with you

40:14.400 --> 40:20.560
you cried for like 30 uninterrupted minutes like once you once sad shit in that movie started

40:20.560 --> 40:26.800
happening you didn't stop crying until the the fucking credits were rolling my emotions are like

40:26.800 --> 40:33.360
like right below my eyeballs and so at any given point one extra drop of emotion and I'm over it

40:33.360 --> 40:39.440
I'm trying this actually has to schedule time at four o'clock on Sundays to pay off the crying that

40:39.440 --> 40:43.360
he earned while watching the first 15 minutes of love I remember I'm still crying while at the

40:43.360 --> 40:47.920
beginning I remember when I was uh last in town and I uh we were at lunch and I was like I'll

40:47.920 --> 40:57.200
pick up the check and you're like don't you do this to me right now oh no oh no oh no did you

40:57.200 --> 41:04.000
see that guy a new sign at Giovanni's no come on my childhood said I wouldn't do this I told myself

41:04.000 --> 41:12.160
I'd be strong strong I'm a big strong man I the worst is like if I'm up at an unreasonable hour

41:12.160 --> 41:15.600
when I used to work at Best Buy and I had to be in at like five o'clock in the morning there's

41:15.600 --> 41:20.640
something about like five o'clock in the morning by yourself and like a big empty half-dark Best Buy

41:20.640 --> 41:24.720
that I I would just sit there and like start singing a little song to myself and weeping

41:25.280 --> 41:36.240
just while I'm like doing all the stockpounds oh no oh here we go um yeah I there's something

41:36.240 --> 41:41.680
crying is like to me finishing a cry is like waking up from a good nap and it's like okay

41:41.680 --> 41:45.840
time to start my day in earnest you know what I mean it's like well the crying is over now it's

41:45.840 --> 41:50.800
time for happy times I I'm actually kind of jealous of you Travis that you get that you get

41:50.800 --> 41:55.600
to clean out your man yeah I fucking love crying yeah the best time to do is in the shower because

41:55.600 --> 42:00.560
you're already wet and that way it just mingles no because if you cry when you're like fully

42:00.560 --> 42:05.280
dressed you're gonna get all of the tears and snot all over your clothes how hard are you crying

42:05.280 --> 42:16.240
so that so you're uh I actually like uh much like Daryl Hannah and Blade Runner or Ernest

42:16.240 --> 42:23.120
in uh Ernest Goes to Jail I like to cry in the rain oh you mean Ernest Goes to Camp when he's

42:23.120 --> 42:29.600
saying sure I'm glad it's raining nobody sees your teardrops when it rains holy shit check

42:29.600 --> 42:34.800
you walked right into it I am not ashamed of my love for the Ernest movies um I guess I was

42:34.800 --> 42:38.480
thinking Ernest Goes to Jail because that's the one where he has the doppelganger right

42:38.480 --> 42:43.600
and but he's also very sad because he's incarcerated and also because his life is as

42:43.600 --> 42:49.600
a janitor at a bank right and he gets electrocuted like 16 times yeah a lot all yeah it gives him

42:49.600 --> 42:56.320
superpowers hey everybody what's that movie like I'm Ernest gets superpowers I bet after Ernest

42:56.320 --> 43:01.600
Goes to Jail and Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest gets scared stupid he was really really hesitant

43:01.600 --> 43:05.920
you have to feel bad for Slam Dunk Ernest because that is halfway across the video store

43:07.920 --> 43:14.720
why is it called Ernest Goes to the Hoop Ernest takes it to the to the point zone

43:14.720 --> 43:19.360
you got all those Ernest movies hanging out next to each other and then like way off someone's

43:19.360 --> 43:22.880
looking through the essence and they're like what is this Ernest and then there's like

43:23.760 --> 43:29.440
extreme with an x Ernest stunts and it's like I don't even know where that is they're looking

43:29.440 --> 43:34.560
for like super Dave Osborne movies that those Ernest pops up hey this is the craziest video

43:34.560 --> 43:40.400
store I've ever been to it's the best video store you know I loved I loved Ernest Scared Stupid and

43:40.400 --> 43:45.040
Ernest Goes to Jail and Ernest Goes to Camp but this importance of being Ernest just was not as

43:45.040 --> 43:56.000
funny I think the craziest thing about this video store is that it's extant um I like to because I

43:56.000 --> 44:02.480
can cry completely still faced I can I could be having a car I could I could be crying right now

44:02.480 --> 44:08.240
and talking to you the way that I'm talking to you with you would have no clue so my jam is I just do

44:08.240 --> 44:12.480
it in public and see if I can get away with it like a dangerous like a dangerous thing like a

44:12.480 --> 44:17.280
little dangerous I'll do it at best I'll do it at Best Buy but like in the middle of the day in the

44:17.280 --> 44:23.440
crowded store would you describe this as a crying game not the crying game no no no it's awkward

44:23.440 --> 44:27.360
there's more than the one have you ever yawned so hard that like you cried not like violently

44:27.360 --> 44:31.920
crap but like some tears come out what is wrong with you that doesn't happen to you just like

44:31.920 --> 44:37.760
you yawn really hard and like your eyes just like kind of water a little bit you just go with it no

44:37.760 --> 44:43.040
no you already got this thing started already primed the engine might as well no I remember

44:43.040 --> 44:47.840
when when I when we were young and we were at church and I would yawn really hard because it's

44:47.840 --> 44:52.560
church um I always got really worried that people would look over and think that I was crying because

44:52.560 --> 44:57.440
I was just like super moved by like the collection song yeah but really it's that I yawn and I was

44:57.440 --> 45:03.200
always tempted to look and go no no I was yawning it's not real tears I'm not moved or anything

45:04.080 --> 45:08.640
not a bit I feel nothing there's nothing behind these eyes

45:11.040 --> 45:14.960
now I feel like I cry too much now you guys have made me self-conscious I'm never gonna cry again

45:14.960 --> 45:23.040
I feel like if you don't like that if you think about going the rest of your life without crying

45:23.040 --> 45:27.280
again that would actually be sad enough to make you cry for at least 45 minutes that's probably

45:27.280 --> 45:32.880
true um I've got it it's actually gotten to a point now where if I see a especially poignant

45:32.880 --> 45:37.920
commercial I will start crying oh but there's some commercials out there that are real doozers

45:37.920 --> 45:46.880
uh-huh the the fucking one with the guy gets a dog and is in in a car and he drives to go

45:46.880 --> 45:52.480
camping griffin griffin don't and then they get out I said I wouldn't do this they're playing

45:52.480 --> 45:57.680
and then they keep doing they keep repeating oh no the dog's getting older and then at the end

45:57.680 --> 46:04.560
he just gets out of tombstone from his car and kills the dog with it no the dog is dead why would

46:04.560 --> 46:10.240
he get what then he smashes the dog with the tombstone my uh Sydney says that her dad used to

46:10.240 --> 46:16.160
always cry at the uh at the commercial it was a mcdonald's commercial where a dad drives his

46:16.160 --> 46:21.360
daughter to mcdonald's and she's meeting her friends there and he she asked him to wait in

46:21.360 --> 46:26.720
the car while she goes in and hangs out with her friends and she says that was making her cry and

46:26.720 --> 46:32.720
all I can think about is that's the craziest hang ever like what is this hang wait in the car I'm

46:32.720 --> 46:40.320
too embarrassed to hang out with you with my friends inside of mcdonald's me my buds are gonna

46:40.320 --> 46:46.960
go inside and get a cbo and I'd like you to hang here if that's cool don't ruin this for me old

46:46.960 --> 46:53.680
man this is my mcdonald's time yeah this only happens once maybe twice a week I always cried

46:53.680 --> 47:00.000
those e-trade commercials with the talking baby because like I think about like when I have a baby

47:00.000 --> 47:05.200
if it comes out and looks really cute but sounds like an old ass dude I would be like mega bummed

47:05.200 --> 47:12.240
out yeah wicked wicked bummed um can we can we address a timely yahoo answer okay this one was

47:12.240 --> 47:16.400
sent in by steve lewis thank you steve it's by yahoo answers user billy jack h who asks

47:17.360 --> 47:21.840
how can I rely on punxsutawney phil when everything around him overcast his shadow

47:21.840 --> 47:28.080
do I get my own groundhog with groundhog day rapidly approaching I have some aggravation

47:28.080 --> 47:32.560
towards the way punxsutawney phil comes out of its burrow but it is impossible to see a shadow

47:32.560 --> 47:36.560
because there are so many people equipment and booths around him these people who run the event

47:36.560 --> 47:42.160
then say he didn't see his shadow and there will be an early spring well I'm tired of relying of

47:42.160 --> 47:47.440
this commercial groundhog informing me how much winter is left I'd like to get my own groundhog

47:47.440 --> 47:53.840
and intend to let him to come out in a very clear non-crowded area that way I will at least know the

47:53.840 --> 47:59.120
truth if we'll have six more weeks of winter or not should I get my own groundhog should I do

47:59.120 --> 48:10.480
that this is the best thing I've ever heard I've never heard seen observed thought about a groundhog

48:10.480 --> 48:15.600
in literally any other context yeah right I don't know where you would obtain one I don't know where

48:15.600 --> 48:19.920
they're what they're native to no but this I'm also gonna be honest and it occurs to me that

48:19.920 --> 48:26.080
it seems to me like taking it out of the context of punxsutawney phil it doesn't count anymore

48:26.080 --> 48:29.920
like or else everybody would just have groundhogs he has a fucking excellent point because there

48:29.920 --> 48:35.760
are there's a lot of hardware you know there are the news newscasters there bring a lot of

48:35.760 --> 48:40.880
hardware to the scene how about the fucking lights the camera lights like how how's this

48:40.880 --> 48:46.080
yeah god forbid they might spoil the entirely scientific process no but I'm saying but they

48:46.080 --> 48:52.400
have built these fucking rules around this system and then they're tampering with the with the rules

48:53.360 --> 48:58.640
the groundhog comes out and sees like 800 people all standing around screaming at him of course

48:58.640 --> 49:05.360
he's fucking scared he's just he's a rodent he's a small creature I would be scared but the thing

49:05.360 --> 49:10.800
we now go to punxsutawney where phil is coming out of his hole thank you oh hold on punxsutawney

49:10.800 --> 49:16.960
is addressing the crowd hello everyone can you give me some fucking room could you all spread out

49:16.960 --> 49:22.880
a little bit I'm having a hard time before me give phil some space to do his thing please

49:23.440 --> 49:29.360
great I'm trying to get down and uh it's not gonna happen with all these uh newscasters around

49:29.360 --> 49:34.000
what if they opened up the door what if they opened up the little groundhog door and he was

49:34.000 --> 49:39.440
jerking off okay this is what you want to see he's like are you this is what you came here to see

49:39.440 --> 49:46.560
are you guys fucking kidding me is it February fucking second already are you shitting me I don't

49:46.560 --> 49:51.440
give a shit that it's a whole day based around me you knock you knock first because sometimes

49:51.440 --> 49:56.480
a groundhog is jerking off as they all want to do do you see these little nubby hands they feel

49:56.480 --> 50:02.000
great here's the problem with with complaining about the lights and the cameras and everything

50:02.000 --> 50:09.760
if you have lights and cameras and and everything it's a celebration if you're a guy in this

50:09.760 --> 50:15.280
backyard pulling a rodent out of a hole and staring at it you have to register on a list

50:15.280 --> 50:22.640
yeah a government list but but at the same time what do you do when you get that minority report

50:24.560 --> 50:29.840
from your from your indie underground groundhog that's like nah dog it is time for six more weeks

50:29.840 --> 50:36.080
of winter and but the mainstream groundhog says that it's springtime what do you do who do you

50:36.080 --> 50:43.200
send a letter to in that circumstance yeah who do you i have to here's what's going to really

50:43.200 --> 50:48.240
fuck you up that we got three more weeks of winter and then nothing right tell the authorities

50:50.000 --> 50:58.080
what we need we need an impartial elected frankly elected senate or or house of representatives

50:58.080 --> 51:05.200
approved position for nine groundhogs that will come out and you know create a majority opinion

51:05.200 --> 51:09.040
on what the weather is going to be because this person is a great president i don't want to alarm

51:09.040 --> 51:17.680
you yeah but my groundhogs a statue on steve's listen according to miami marcus

51:21.920 --> 51:25.600
i think they would all have to be gathered in one region because i feel like miami marcus

51:25.600 --> 51:30.320
would pretty much see his shadow all day pretty much all time i think that was in will smith's

51:30.320 --> 51:34.880
miami's he talked about how your shadow's always there me and marcus popping it off

51:36.480 --> 51:41.040
looking down getting spooked winter is coming let's go get some carrots

51:43.280 --> 51:49.200
because groundhogs love carrots thank you thank you my god saw his shadow and the shadow of death

51:49.200 --> 51:54.880
i want to congratulate us on doing this for five minutes and not mentioning the movie

51:54.880 --> 51:59.280
groundhog day i think we did it accomplishment and achievement and now we can all breathe a

51:59.280 --> 52:04.560
little easier i watched it yesterday i did too what a fucking i watched it a thousand times

52:04.560 --> 52:11.760
yesterday okay uh we were watching it yesterday and uh my we were watching the film about halfway

52:11.760 --> 52:16.080
through sydney leans over to me and says well she doesn't lean over to me we're on a couch

52:16.080 --> 52:24.960
so uh that's how i've instructed her to behave she she looks and she says you know the tragedy

52:24.960 --> 52:32.640
of this movie is that no one could ever love andy mcdowell she said given a thousand years

52:32.640 --> 52:38.720
you could not love andy mcdowell but i said that is 100 true and then i was watching the movie and

52:39.440 --> 52:44.320
something occurred to me that had never occurred what the movie is about i read an interview with

52:44.320 --> 52:49.200
harold ramis where he said that the movie had become very popular with buddhists

52:50.000 --> 52:56.640
and when you watch the movie you realize that like he doesn't it's not about getting the girl

52:56.640 --> 53:05.040
or even trying to live a good life um phil doesn't get out of the loop until he has awareness

53:05.040 --> 53:11.840
until he's completely aware and satisfied in his own situation that's when he breaks it it wasn't

53:11.840 --> 53:16.480
about oh i think you think back on that movie you think it's about him learning to like love

53:16.480 --> 53:21.120
or be a good person or what or play piano it's none of those things yeah it's a little bit

53:21.120 --> 53:27.600
about 100 immediate awareness that's that's that's deep that's deep stuff when i watch that movie i

53:27.600 --> 53:32.560
also like to pretend that chris elliot's character is also looping through time and just trying to

53:32.560 --> 53:38.800
like get it together and maybe get some maybe get some trim and he just like but in the final day

53:38.800 --> 53:44.240
that phil gets it together and does get him some trim chris elliot comes to grips with the fact

53:44.240 --> 53:50.400
that no he is he is virtually unfuckable and once he has that realization he is also freed from the

53:50.400 --> 53:54.960
loop i would also like to point out that something that's not addressed in that movie that always

53:54.960 --> 54:01.280
kind of freaks me out is that once he breaks the loop and wakes up the next day one no one will

54:01.280 --> 54:09.040
ever believe him yeah two does he instantly age all the time that he spent i don't think so i he

54:09.040 --> 54:14.480
just withers away to dust before annie mcdowell's horrified eyes did annie mcdowell complete her

54:14.480 --> 54:18.880
loop of trying to get through a sentence sounding like a real person saying things in the world

54:19.600 --> 54:27.440
she doesn't do that at all she never does that where is your accent from like do you think it

54:27.440 --> 54:34.080
must also be really disconcerting to be phil on february 3rd because you know he's like crossing

54:34.080 --> 54:39.920
the street without looking you're like no no it's fine it's fine there's no cars trust me ah shit

54:40.640 --> 54:46.880
a guy's gonna break a plate in hayden hey break that plate i need this kid climb that tree fall

54:46.880 --> 54:51.760
out he's gonna spiral into madness like it's never addressed but he he's gonna lose his mind

54:51.760 --> 54:57.840
he's just waiting underneath a tree with his arms open just waiting hey does anyone kid want to climb

54:57.840 --> 55:02.480
this tree any kids no i learned how to be a piano virtuoso in one day

55:06.720 --> 55:12.880
i don't think i don't think he loses this watch i can rob a bank and there's no consequences

55:12.880 --> 55:22.240
