00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.920
Hey, everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother made an advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:47.920 --> 00:51.600
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your baby's brother, Griffin McElroy. This is a genuine

00:51.600 --> 00:57.280
MBMBAM prank. This is a genuine MBMBAM prank that you're listening to. Welcome to a MBMBAM

00:57.280 --> 01:01.520
prank. It's our brother, Travis. It's not a fake prank. It's a genuine prank. And we're

01:01.520 --> 01:05.520
pranking genuine. I wish we're pranking our brother, Travis, because he left the show to

01:05.520 --> 01:12.720
go get pizza. So what's the prank? It's not much of a prank. Travis, we got you. We already started

01:12.720 --> 01:20.160
the show without you. That was a MBMBAM prank. First of its kind. The amount of show that you

01:20.160 --> 01:24.960
miss will be reflected in your monthly MBMBAM paycheck. You're going to be docked for those

01:24.960 --> 01:29.520
minutes. You could have told several jokes in there. I wouldn't have though. Now that the prank

01:29.520 --> 01:35.200
is over, let's go behind the scenes. Travis didn't actually leave to go get pizza. That was just like

01:35.200 --> 01:40.160
a staging, very elaborate staging that we did because we wanted to introduce some new heat into

01:40.160 --> 01:45.200
the show. And Justin thought that this would be a good idea. I think it's a bad idea. To be fair,

01:45.200 --> 01:49.680
I didn't think it was a good idea. The producers thought it would be a good idea. I kind of went

01:49.680 --> 01:54.080
along with them. And they were just getting that feedback from all the focus groups and stuff that

01:54.080 --> 01:58.480
we did. Who were like, well, there needs to be more pranks on the show. Travis, confirm or deny.

01:58.480 --> 02:03.680
Are you going to be eating pizza while we record our smash hit comedy podcast? Is that the level?

02:03.680 --> 02:09.760
Is that the level of respect to our readership for the written version of My Brother, My Brother

02:09.760 --> 02:13.600
and Me that we released? The wildly unpopular written version of My Brother, My Brother. That

02:13.600 --> 02:19.280
we released on the deep webs. I am just worried that if I wait till we're done recording, that's

02:19.280 --> 02:23.520
an hour of cool off time for the pizza. And I think the people at home will understand that.

02:23.520 --> 02:28.720
Well, I got I got a question, Dillard. Why did you order pizza when you knew that the

02:28.720 --> 02:35.520
Chuckles were the Chuckles? Because I just got home. I mean, but like, it's not you knew that

02:35.520 --> 02:42.560
this confluence of this pizza podcast crossover was was unavoidable. You knew it. You know,

02:42.560 --> 02:46.640
Justin, I got to be honest with you. It didn't sneak up on me, but I was very short sighted.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.520
I thought that the two would not coincide as deeply as they have. I didn't realize there would

02:51.520 --> 02:57.840
be so much spillover into my professional life. So I feel like, you know, I have a lot to apologize

02:57.840 --> 03:02.160
for. There's only one remedy, Travis. I'm going to take some time off to rebuild my relationship

03:02.160 --> 03:09.120
with my family. I hope you respect my privacy in this trying time. And the trying time should last

03:09.120 --> 03:14.160
about four and a half minutes. That's about how long it's going to take me to crush this.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.840
Travis, I need you to stand up and throw that saw in the trash. I cannot do that.

03:19.840 --> 03:26.080
No, it's as a symbolic gesture to our readership to show that you still fucking after 200,000

03:26.080 --> 03:30.560
episodes that you still fucking respect the hour. Travis, we're talking about 200,000

03:31.360 --> 03:38.240
human hours that these people are pouring into the sieve of our podcast. And you are you are

03:38.240 --> 03:42.080
aiming that sieve into a dumpster unless you symbolically stand up and throw that you're

03:42.080 --> 03:45.280
eating the pizza right now, aren't you? No, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm throwing it into

03:45.280 --> 03:50.880
the garbage like my family. That is also what you call your stomach, though. So I don't think

03:50.880 --> 03:53.840
that that counts. I hate your pizza so much. I'm going to turn it into poop.

04:00.640 --> 04:05.200
Welcome to pizza break. Our new podcast where we talk about we order a za and then you listen

04:05.200 --> 04:09.280
to us eat it for an hour. It is hot and delicious, too. This one is an

04:09.280 --> 04:15.840
Asiago crust and I got it with like a white fresh fresh from Sicily chicken and it was well,

04:15.840 --> 04:20.080
it was supposed to have spinach on it. They didn't do that from me. I didn't really want it.

04:20.080 --> 04:27.360
The rolling verdant hills of Sicily. Travis had this fresh artisanal za coptered in.

04:27.360 --> 04:33.280
Our listeners have spent one thousand eight hundred and twenty six years

04:33.280 --> 04:40.160
listening to. Did you just map that out? Exaggeration cumulatively, nearly a millennia

04:40.160 --> 04:46.000
of pleasure. Uh huh. Nearly two millennia. All leading up to this moment of pleasure.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.120
When I can eat pizza in their ears. Is that somebody's ASMR trigger? Oh, it's got to be.

04:51.120 --> 04:56.800
God knows it's not mine, though. I hope it's not thin crust. It's my S.A.D. trigger because it makes

04:56.800 --> 05:01.600
me very sad. All right, I'll take a break from pizza. I'll save it for the money zone.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.400
Uh, perfect. Sounds good. You always find that in anyway. So listen, this is as you've almost

05:06.400 --> 05:12.080
certainly guessed, this is a comedy advice podcast where we that's Travis, by the way,

05:12.080 --> 05:16.240
is our middle brother. We we take questions from you, the listening public and the readers

05:17.200 --> 05:23.280
that we apparently have and we turn them out like into wisdom. So now let us let us away.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.080
Um, hold on. I got to let the cat in. Sorry. Don't prank me, though, while I'm gone.

05:28.080 --> 05:33.920
This is a my brother, my brother, me prank. Prank day two. Griffin is left to go bring his cat in.

05:33.920 --> 05:38.320
And now Travis and I are taking over the show. What are we going to do? How do these pranks work?

05:38.320 --> 05:44.320
I missed the first one. You put a whoopee cushion on his chair. OK, but he's but he's in Austin.

05:45.520 --> 05:50.880
Call somebody. OK, get on Craigslist for Austin. Uh huh. Get on Austin Craigslist.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.960
If anybody in Austin is listening to this show, go put a whoopee cushion on his chair.

05:54.960 --> 06:04.400
I got I got him in on. Wait a minute. Wait, let me just sit down in my chair. Blart.

06:04.400 --> 06:11.120
This is one of those special Paul Blart themed whoopee cush. Let's start this podcast. Over.

06:13.600 --> 06:18.480
That would be the end. Welcome to my brother, my brother, me. Episode one in my neighborhood

06:18.480 --> 06:22.880
outskirts of Pittsburgh. A lot of people own dogs but must not pick up after them because

06:22.880 --> 06:27.600
there are turds everywhere. Once I even saw an owner let their dog drop a hot one

06:27.600 --> 06:31.920
and then just continue on their way. I did not know what to say and I was scared of confronting

06:31.920 --> 06:37.280
them. Is there a good way to confront someone if I catch them in the lack of act again?

06:37.280 --> 06:41.760
That's from Dodging Doo Doo in Pittsburgh. I once saw somebody do that, like they their

06:41.760 --> 06:47.760
dog just pooped in the middle of the sidewalk and they kept walking. Do you guys remember like

06:47.760 --> 06:54.320
like, God, like a decade ago when every other time you left your house, you stepped in shit

06:54.320 --> 06:59.760
like every like before before we came to our senses and we're like, we should we should really

06:59.760 --> 07:04.720
be clean. It should like be a law or something that we just like, you know, handle it. And back

07:04.720 --> 07:09.360
when we didn't handle it, literally 50 percent of the time you cross the threshold of your house.

07:09.360 --> 07:14.560
So your first step out of the house was in shit because it was fucking it was Golgotha out there.

07:14.560 --> 07:20.880
Was that the place? God knows that I'm awesome at biblical trivia. We've proven this time.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.000
You've proven that going to all those biblical trivia nights at your local pub.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.120
That's true. But at the time you insisted that Abraham was the father of Cain and Abel.

07:29.120 --> 07:32.000
I did my best. I did my best. I did my very best.

07:32.720 --> 07:40.080
OK, so judging by Obama's recently released Midnight Amendments, this is definitely in

07:40.080 --> 07:45.920
violation. Come on down. Oh, this is definitely this is anti. Come on. This is come off.

07:45.920 --> 07:50.560
I would say this. I have to. I have to. This might be a triple. This might be a triple threat.

07:51.600 --> 07:57.840
I think it might. It might. It might be nice. And it's super not be cool. Yeah.

07:58.960 --> 08:03.280
I would say it's in violation of the first two. But I got to admit, if I saw that happening

08:03.280 --> 08:11.200
and I was definitely not going to be in the path of the the poo poo, there might be a part of me

08:12.000 --> 08:18.400
that was kind of like nice. I only feel that way when I see like a like a big old bulldog

08:18.400 --> 08:22.640
taking a crap. And that's that's hilarious. You see a bulldog taking a crap. And then about

08:22.640 --> 08:30.400
20 to 25 paces behind that, you see a big Wall Street broker and a big fancy suit walk. And

08:30.400 --> 08:37.920
you're like, oh, this is going to be yummy. He's going to get it on his wingtips. Oh, yeah. Shitty

08:37.920 --> 08:43.280
wingtips. Come on. But what you don't know is that he is a broker, but he invests his money

08:43.280 --> 08:47.200
so that he can give more to the charities he supports. And he yells that he steps in shit.

08:47.200 --> 08:54.240
How can this happen to me? I'm a charitable stockbroker, man. You're that one percentage

08:54.240 --> 09:03.040
has stepped in 99 percent of that dog. Why not 100 percent? Because he's avoided a microbe of it

09:03.680 --> 09:07.200
because he's got his wingtips. So it doesn't have toe space that normally would have crushed the

09:07.200 --> 09:11.040
rest here. I OK, this is I completely get where the question asker is coming from,

09:11.040 --> 09:17.520
because this is one of those like. You would be hypothetically within your rights to say, like,

09:17.520 --> 09:23.280
hey, pick up your dog shit. But at the same time, it's like they they their only response to that

09:23.280 --> 09:28.800
is going to be, hey, fuck you and keep walking. I mean, really, you can't be like I think that

09:28.800 --> 09:34.640
you are perfectly within your rights if it's like if it's your lawn or or maybe a lot of

09:35.200 --> 09:41.600
a charitable organization or something. My dog only shits in the Ronald McDonald House lawn.

09:41.600 --> 09:49.440
I don't understand why it is a highly laxative effect that that clown has on him. I just you

09:49.440 --> 09:54.160
can't go around being like Earth police like people are going to do that. And maybe you

09:55.280 --> 09:59.280
you know, you yell at this person, you make them feel bad. They don't do it. They go around the

09:59.280 --> 10:03.360
corner. They'll do it somewhere else. That's how these criminals operate. Because if you really

10:03.360 --> 10:07.760
care, read a Malcolm Gladwell book. That's true. If you care deeply about it, you can always just

10:07.760 --> 10:12.640
like carry some bags around with yourself and like when your dog finish shitting, you just like

10:13.280 --> 10:18.480
stoop right down and pick it up. I'm looking at them like, no, I got it. And no problem about it.

10:18.480 --> 10:23.440
No problem. No, you you have the fun part with the dog where you like play fetch and run around

10:23.440 --> 10:27.760
with them. And I'll just pick up the shit for the dog that I have zero percent interest in.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.680
It's just like Gandhi said, be the change that you want to see in the world. But

10:31.680 --> 10:35.600
be like kind of shitty and passive aggressive about it. Exactly. While you do it. Travis,

10:35.600 --> 10:39.760
could you follow him after you clear the first shit? Can you just follow him like bag wrapped

10:39.760 --> 10:44.160
around your hand? Just waiting. I just want to be here in case just in case I got your back.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.960
I'm your support in this. We're going to do this together. We'll talk to you. Could we swing by

10:48.960 --> 10:56.320
Whole Foods? I'm sympathetic to the dog owner in this situation because 100 percent of the time

10:56.320 --> 11:02.560
I leave the house to buy groceries, just like one or two things. I always forget my bag.

11:03.280 --> 11:07.600
Austin has a plastic bag band. I don't know if that's popping off in L.A. and Huntington yet.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.440
And I never have a bag. And I always have to buy a new bag. But you can't buy a shit bag when

11:13.440 --> 11:17.440
you're walking your dog on the street and you forgot your shitty bag. And like, what do you do

11:17.440 --> 11:20.400
in that situation? I'm not going to touch it with my hands because I'm a fucking human being trying

11:20.400 --> 11:25.280
to just like live my life in the world. Can you still get plastic garbage bags? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.960
Yeah. For like, yeah, for your trash can. Sure. Can you just carry one of those around with you,

11:28.960 --> 11:33.840
like some sort of deranged Santa Claus? Can you imagine if you saw like a tiny little

11:33.840 --> 11:37.760
while finished shitting and the person pulled out like just a giant trash bag,

11:37.760 --> 11:43.360
put it over like their whole body to pick it up and then tied it off and just carried it with you?

11:43.360 --> 11:47.760
That's a fucking funny image right there, you guys. All right. Train another dog to pick up

11:47.760 --> 11:54.160
that dog's poop. That's what if you got horrified by it and stamped on it as soon as it came out,

11:54.160 --> 11:58.480
like you thought it was alive when your dog shits on a lawn, just cordon off the lawn with police

11:58.480 --> 12:06.320
tape. Yeah. Nothing to see here. Move along a little chalk outline. Do you guys want to Yahoo?

12:06.320 --> 12:13.840
Yes. This Yahoo was sent in by level eight hundred and sixty two shaman,

12:13.840 --> 12:18.240
Drew Davenport. And yes, he leveled up this week because he fucking crushed it this week.

12:18.240 --> 12:21.040
Thank you, Drew Davenport. This might be an all Drew episode. Spoilers.

12:22.080 --> 12:27.520
Spy Yahoo answers user James, who asks, when a caterpillar is making a cocoon,

12:27.520 --> 12:32.880
does it know it's going to become a butterfly or is it just like, what the fuck am I doing with my

12:32.880 --> 12:44.080
life? Okay, wait, I'm confused by the question. What am I, what am I even doing right now?

12:45.440 --> 12:50.720
Do they mean while it's making the cocoon, is it going, what the fuck is happening? Or do they

12:50.720 --> 12:55.600
mean like the caterpillars going, I got nothing to do. I'm just going to stay inside my weird shell

12:55.600 --> 13:00.240
thing. But see, that's the thing. It doesn't, it's never made a weird shell thing, right? They just

13:00.240 --> 13:04.240
do that the one time, right? They can't switch between butterflies and caterpillars at will.

13:04.240 --> 13:08.400
They're not fucking like lycanthropes. They, they, they just do it the one time. So they're

13:08.400 --> 13:13.760
just like up in a tree. And then all of a sudden, like they, I imagine it is somewhat similar to

13:13.760 --> 13:19.360
the first time that you discover ejaculate. And then that starts happening. And then all of a

13:19.360 --> 13:24.560
sudden you're in it and you're like, wait a minute, what am I, what am I even doing right now? What is

13:24.560 --> 13:31.200
this? It's all over me. It's got to be confusing as shit to be a caterpillar and be like, I was

13:31.200 --> 13:35.120
supposed to hang out with Steve today. I went over to his place and there was just like a weird,

13:35.120 --> 13:40.480
hangy shell thing. Yeah. I don't understand that. Wait, what am I doing with my butt right now?

13:40.480 --> 13:43.760
What am I, what am I doing with my butt? What does this mean?

13:43.760 --> 13:53.840
If you're a dad butterfly, you've got to be like, I don't know. It never happened to me.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.600
Well, you must be like super sick or something. I've never seen.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.560
We got to get to the bug. Or just say like, I'll see you in six years.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.120
I've got to be in this thing for six years. Yeah. You'll probably die in there. Goodbye.

14:09.120 --> 14:16.400
That shit's got to be crazy. Wouldn't it be great? Like just the very idea of that.

14:16.400 --> 14:21.520
Like if, if human beings for the first like 30 years looked one way and then went to sleep for

14:21.520 --> 14:25.680
like two years and they woke up and they were like birds and everybody was just like, yeah,

14:25.680 --> 14:29.280
that's normal. That's just how it, that's what you do. We have the internet, right? Like the,

14:30.000 --> 14:37.600
as soon as a silken thread emerges from the tip of my penis, I can very quickly be like, Siri,

14:37.600 --> 14:40.560
what's coming out of my penis? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? She's like,

14:40.560 --> 14:46.320
chill, chill, chill Griffin, chill, chill boss hog. Cause that's what I told Siri to call me.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.760
Chill boss hog. It's going to be cool. You're cocooning and pretty soon you're going to come

14:49.760 --> 14:52.800
out and this is what you're going to look like. And I'm going to go awesome. Caterpillars don't

14:52.800 --> 15:00.080
got Siri. They don't. They just get up in a tree, silk and thread. And that's got to be so scary.

15:00.720 --> 15:05.360
Is it possible we're giving the caterpillars too much credit that maybe like it starts coming out

15:05.360 --> 15:11.680
and they just go, okay, I'm down. Whatever. Fuck it. I guess this is my day now. Sure. Caterpillars

15:11.680 --> 15:16.560
really the most easygoing insect. I'm apparently the Matthew McConaughey of bugs. Yeah, cool.

15:16.560 --> 15:22.400
Whatever. All right. You know, yesterday I tried, uh, I tried an Oakley for the first time. Today

15:22.400 --> 15:26.640
I'm going to be trapped in a weird thing that came out of my butt. Sure. Whatever. I listened,

15:26.640 --> 15:32.720
I listened to fusion jazz for the first time. I tried Cuban food. I did. Very spicy, but I liked

15:32.720 --> 15:38.000
it. I did not hate it. So I'm down for the adventure. You know what I mean? Let's just

15:38.000 --> 15:44.080
see what happens. Do you think I've never seen like a butterfly come out of a cocoon? Actually,

15:44.080 --> 15:47.280
you know what? I think I have seen a video of a butterfly coming out of a cocoon and they fly

15:47.280 --> 15:52.720
away. How the fuck does that happen? Explain that to me science. Cause it's not like you,

15:52.720 --> 15:56.720
you get wrapped up in a cocoon. Silk comes out of your butt. You're wrapped up in a cocoon. And

15:56.720 --> 16:01.120
then when the silk is done coming out of your butt, a caterpillar book comes out of your butt

16:01.120 --> 16:07.520
that says how to fly. You want it to be more like greatest American hero. Like without the manual,

16:07.520 --> 16:12.960
they're just flying around, slamming into trees or just fall. They just fall. Don't you think

16:12.960 --> 16:18.000
statistically there has to have like at least once that a caterpillar went into a cocoon

16:18.000 --> 16:23.120
and then the cocoon opened up and he was still a caterpillar and he was like, ah, damn it must be

16:23.120 --> 16:28.320
such a bummer when you're find out you're a butterfly, you're flying around. That's great.

16:28.320 --> 16:34.720
And then you're like, so what do I eat now? It turns out still leaves. I'm almost certain it's

16:34.720 --> 16:41.760
like, uh, like, uh, like a juice or some sort of the juice of the flower. They like pollen and

16:41.760 --> 16:47.360
dung and tree sap and rotting fruit and human beings, other butterflies. We don't know anything

16:47.360 --> 16:54.080
about bugs or anything. I guess even bugologists are like butterflies, man. They're crazy. They're

16:54.080 --> 17:01.280
crazy. I bet there's an entomologist listened to our show. I like really excited and then really

17:01.280 --> 17:06.640
sad. I've been waiting for this butterfly moment this whole time. I thought they were talking

17:06.640 --> 17:10.080
about something I care about. They had that one episode where they talked about the Ashton Kutcher

17:10.080 --> 17:14.480
film butterfly effect. And I thought that was going to be my moment, but very little of that

17:14.480 --> 17:19.600
discussion was based on the physiology of butterflies. Here we go. Time to buck up. I'm dead

17:19.600 --> 17:25.600
now. I have a new feature for the show. Okay. I have a new feature I'm bringing to the show.

17:25.600 --> 17:34.480
This is a haunted doll watch. Justin texted us at two in the morning with this idea that he was so

17:34.480 --> 17:39.680
psyched about. I was so psyched about haunted doll watch. This is my feature that everybody can hate.

17:39.680 --> 17:46.560
Haunted doll watch live for eBay. Just to set this up for you guys. I have a little bit of information

17:46.560 --> 17:52.240
about haunted dolls. This is from Miss Lady on eBay. In an article titled what to expect from

17:52.240 --> 17:57.600
your haunted doll. Hello, this is Miss Lady. Yes, I am a collector of paranormal items,

17:57.600 --> 18:02.960
dolls in particular. I guess a part of me buys the items for curiosity to see what will happen.

18:02.960 --> 18:07.920
Also to hope that there would be some particular activity to convince non-believers in my household

18:07.920 --> 18:12.960
that these things exist. For whatever the reason to buy these items, there are some things to

18:12.960 --> 18:19.280
consider. I've purchased a few dolls and notice these items some things do occur. First, I used

18:19.280 --> 18:23.520
to buy my eyes from individuals who would sell many other haunted items. For most of these,

18:23.520 --> 18:30.640
I've noticed no paranormal activity. Well, yeah, because I have encountered exactly zero haunted

18:30.640 --> 18:35.360
items in my lifetime. There aren't people that just naturally come across 300 that they sell

18:35.360 --> 18:42.480
on bulk on Amazon Prime. Be wary of the seller who has hundreds of haunted items. Let's be real.

18:42.480 --> 18:46.960
Who could actually acquire all these things? Fuck me. Does that really say that in the next sentence?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.280
Literally, the fucking singularity has occurred.

18:53.440 --> 18:58.560
I hate to say it. You could purchase a doll and the item wasn't really haunted,

18:58.560 --> 19:05.920
just the item next to it was. So okay, you get a doll, right?

19:05.920 --> 19:13.520
You think you have a haunted doll and it turns out that the desk it was on was haunted the whole time.

19:15.760 --> 19:23.360
The house was haunted. I hate to say it. You purchase the item that is haunted and

19:23.360 --> 19:31.600
the spirit eventually leaves. Yes, it's happened to me. Why does she hate to say it? I hate to say

19:31.600 --> 19:37.360
it. Sometimes the spirit leaves. My whole life is so shitty that a ghost in a doll pops into my house

19:37.360 --> 19:44.880
is like, what's your seat? What is your this place sucks. Bye. Oh, Justin, my favorite line in it.

19:44.880 --> 19:49.120
I like antique dolls because there are more chances of it having actually acquired that

19:49.120 --> 19:54.240
energy because it is so old. That's true. Because it's bumped up against so many ghosts, I guess.

19:55.440 --> 20:01.040
A new doll, you go to the Build-A-Bear workshop. That is a 100% no haunting guarantee. I would say

20:01.040 --> 20:05.840
if you don't want to get a haunted toy for your child, Build-A-Bear workshop is the only game in

20:05.840 --> 20:11.440
town where you will get that 100% guarantee because you see the manufacturing process

20:12.480 --> 20:18.000
from start to finish. There are no ghosts. You pick the color, you pick the felt, you pick the

20:18.000 --> 20:23.360
stuffing, you stuff it. It does depend on whether you put a toy heart or a human heart in it.

20:23.360 --> 20:28.560
No, don't do the second one. And the box that says haunted, do you want this one haunted? We

20:28.560 --> 20:33.920
can shoot it with a ghost ray. You check no on that, and you know for sure. But old doll, who

20:33.920 --> 20:38.400
knows? It's Jumanji, baby. Also, don't check the box that says, do you want this doll to become

20:38.400 --> 20:42.960
life-size when you're not around and take your kid on adventures? Don't do it. It seems like a good

20:42.960 --> 20:49.680
idea at first. Seems like fun, but no. They're going to teach them about drugs. Justin, I demand

20:49.680 --> 20:54.640
you buy a haunted doll, and I demand that you start reviewing haunted dolls on YouTube. Haunted doll,

20:54.640 --> 21:00.960
okay, I have one haunted doll to talk to you guys about this week. This week's haunted doll

21:00.960 --> 21:07.040
and haunted doll watch is listed under haunted spirits doll caution on EMF meter paranormal

21:07.040 --> 21:13.920
magic with companion. I'm looking at a picture of a doll with an EMF meter next to it that says

21:13.920 --> 21:20.080
caution. Now it's not danger, this creepy porcelain doll, but it is caution on the EMF meter.

21:20.080 --> 21:25.200
Of course, it measures spirit energy. There's a spirit inside, but it may not try to kill your

21:25.200 --> 21:32.000
kids is what you're saying. Yeah, it may be cool. Just in the description here to talk about this

21:32.000 --> 21:38.880
particular spirit doll, apparently this question asker is getting a lot of flack about having a

21:38.880 --> 21:46.000
doll that was a caution on the EMF meter. And this particular haunted doll owner writes,

21:46.000 --> 21:51.440
I've been asked about spirit dolls that are listed as danger. Madam Christine never, underlined,

21:51.440 --> 21:56.480
adopted a spirit that was demonic. She would never expose her other spirit vessels to that.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.720
She had a way of knowing if there were trouble and she would not bring them into her home.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.880
All of the dolls, et cetera, that are sold by me are of the white light and they will never hurt

22:04.880 --> 22:09.760
all of themselves. They get along with other spirit children. And if they are labeled danger

22:09.760 --> 22:13.600
by Madam Christine's notes, that is because they were little troublemakers of some sort

22:13.600 --> 22:19.440
or downright brats. Most spirit dolls are safe, but there are a few that were considered caution

22:19.440 --> 22:29.280
or danger, but not dangerous. So these are like your super chill, like totally lax, like a haunted

22:29.280 --> 22:34.080
doll. Not like your Chuckies. These aren't like serial killers. These are the ones that like,

22:34.080 --> 22:39.360
maybe they just are going to like hang out with you and say like witty things, I guess.

22:39.360 --> 22:43.760
Yes. As long as you're of the white light, this, this, this child is going to get along with you

22:43.760 --> 22:49.520
just fine. And you could buy it now for $125 or make a bid at $55. You would be the first.

22:49.520 --> 22:49.760
Okay.

22:49.760 --> 22:54.080
What scenario could there be a haunted doll that is not scary?

22:55.360 --> 22:58.320
If my Admiral Ackbar action figure-

22:59.040 --> 23:01.360
Only if he's haunted by Admiral Ackbar.

23:02.320 --> 23:08.480
If my Admiral Ackbar action figure got haunted by anything, I would, I would find it amusing.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.400
Not scary. I would actually love that.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.400
You could buy a haunted clown doll right now.

23:14.400 --> 23:14.880
I can.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.600
No problem.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.080
But I won't.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.560
Buy a haunted clown doll right now for $29.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.040
I don't use-

23:19.040 --> 23:20.480
Looks like a sad clown.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.840
That is a steal, by which I mean, they are stealing your money.

23:23.840 --> 23:29.440
Okay. One super quick, I'm almost done here. Last doll on Haunted Doll Watch this week.

23:29.440 --> 23:33.680
Evil Possessed Haunted Demonic Clown Doll Vessel, $29. Buy it now.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.720
12 people are watching it. They're keeping their finger

23:36.720 --> 23:41.280
here on the paws and like, if this thing doesn't go above 50, I am taking it.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.640
Evil, pure evil.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.280
Let me act, let me act.

23:43.280 --> 23:47.840
The spirit vessel used to be friendly with an Eeyore the Donkey like personality,

23:47.840 --> 23:50.320
but one say something changed.

23:50.320 --> 23:55.440
I believe a demonic entity killed or overpowered the old spirit or took it hostage

23:55.440 --> 23:56.800
and now dominates the vessel.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.640
I'm too afraid to keep it in the house anymore.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.720
The evil spirit told me his name is Ernie.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.720
I'm not convinced that it's his true name.

24:02.720 --> 24:17.840
I have terrible nightmares of him coming at me with an ax.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.280
It's all Ernie's doing.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.160
So buy it.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.440
Do you want this?

24:23.680 --> 24:25.040
It's $29.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.640
I'll take $30.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.400
It is looking for a soul.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.360
You can attempt to ask the spirit questions and desires

24:31.360 --> 24:35.920
or wishes by writing a message and putting it in the cavity of the missing foot.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.280
It will answer you.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.240
Be aware.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.320
It will want something in return.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.080
What is going on?

24:45.200 --> 24:48.320
And there are 12 people in the world that saw this and said,

24:48.320 --> 24:49.440
I'm going to keep an eye on this.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.680
Yeah, can't let that one slip away.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.600
Can't let this evil doll slip away.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.000
Oh, Jesus, please.

24:56.000 --> 24:56.960
That's been our hot dog.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.960
And you can buy it now if you want to just skip.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.320
Just buy it now.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.280
You don't need to watch it.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.160
Just buy it now.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.200
Justin, you want to read a question now that you've spooked?

25:05.200 --> 25:06.480
I'm spooked out right now.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.160
Don't be spooked.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.240
My boyfriend doesn't eat cheese.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.440
Not even on his pizza.

25:14.480 --> 25:17.200
He is not lactose intolerant or allergic.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.200
He just doesn't eat it.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.720
Needless to say,

25:20.720 --> 25:23.040
mealtime in our household can be quite difficult.

25:23.040 --> 25:26.240
How do I get him in the embrace of the wonderful food that is cheese?

25:26.240 --> 25:27.760
That's for cheese, please.

25:27.760 --> 25:31.440
In Pittsburgh again, two Pittsburghians.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.320
The one thing you don't say,

25:34.320 --> 25:36.400
like, is it like,

25:37.600 --> 25:40.800
I think the idea of cheese is gross or is it like,

25:40.800 --> 25:42.560
I don't like the taste of cheese.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.440
I don't like,

25:43.440 --> 25:46.400
what is it that's driving this dude away from cheese?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.200
I can sympathize here because I'm very,

25:51.840 --> 25:53.840
for me, I'm very weird about cheese.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.760
I don't eat uncooked cheese.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.680
I can't eat raw cheese.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.640
Wait, wait, wait.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.600
Wait, the fuck?

26:01.600 --> 26:02.100
What?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.760
You mean like,

26:05.040 --> 26:07.040
non-melted cheese is the only,

26:07.040 --> 26:08.480
cheese has two states,

26:08.480 --> 26:11.040
melted and not melted, or milk.

26:11.040 --> 26:11.520
That's what I mean.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.080
Not cooked cheese is milk.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.320
No, I mean, I can't cook unmelted,

26:16.320 --> 26:18.080
I can't eat unmelted cheese.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.560
What a weird hangup that you have, Justin.

26:20.560 --> 26:21.600
It yaks me out.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.880
It yaks me out, I like it melty and stringy and cheesy,

26:24.880 --> 26:26.400
but when I bite into like,

26:26.400 --> 26:28.080
when people eat cheese cubes like that,

26:28.080 --> 26:30.080
I just want to yarts all over it.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.880
What goes through your head

26:32.880 --> 26:35.120
when you see just like a slice of cheese on a plate?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.720
I'd like to drink that.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.160
That's what goes through his head.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.160
I want that, but more drinkable.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.840
If only it was less al dente.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.640
Yeah, it's too al dente.

26:46.480 --> 26:49.040
I don't know, it's just something about the texture

26:49.040 --> 26:52.800
of unmelted cheese that just grosses me out.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.240
I don't, I can't get down with it.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.400
And if he feels that way about universal cheese,

26:57.600 --> 26:58.800
I am sympathized.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.400
I can't sit here and crochet.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.240
Is it maybe something where Sidney needs to like,

27:02.240 --> 27:04.320
hide some in like pieces of bread

27:04.320 --> 27:06.000
until you get used to the idea of it?

27:06.560 --> 27:08.480
Maybe put some in like applesauce for you?

27:09.120 --> 27:11.520
Why is it so cold and not melted?

27:11.520 --> 27:12.800
That's my thing about it.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.080
Because it's cheese, Justin.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.120
It's cheese, Justin.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.360
This is what I'll say.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.000
Maybe you just let your boyfriend listen to my plight.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Because I am like lactose intolerant.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.560
I eat cheese and like, that's my night.

27:24.560 --> 27:28.080
I plan my nights around like, I want to get my cheese on.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.080
But that means I'm going to be sleeping.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.760
Definitely clear my schedule.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.760
But I'm sleeping in the guest bedroom tonight.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.600
I talked about this with my friends last night

27:35.600 --> 27:36.880
and they laughed at me.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.040
But I thought it was actually a pretty clever piece of,

27:40.320 --> 27:42.880
just a real stroke of genius, a real master stroke.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.200
Where if I do eat something like

27:45.200 --> 27:48.160
my wife's delicious turkey chili

27:48.160 --> 27:52.720
and like I know that I'm gonna have just farts all night,

27:53.600 --> 27:55.280
then I'll sleep in the guest bedroom.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.560
I'll just sleep in the guest bedroom

27:56.560 --> 27:58.240
and that way I don't keep her up.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.840
I don't have to worry about the things that I do.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.560
It's like my little chamber of secrets.

28:05.440 --> 28:06.720
When I accidentally,

28:06.720 --> 28:08.560
I still try to keep that mystery alive

28:08.560 --> 28:10.960
after some 10 years of being together.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.360
When I accidentally toot in front of my wife,

28:13.360 --> 28:17.840
I just kind of freeze like a wild animal

28:17.840 --> 28:18.880
who's been caught in hell.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.640
Oh yeah, no, I get that.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.160
And hope that she didn't notice

28:22.160 --> 28:24.880
or more accurately isn't gonna draw attention to it.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.200
That's what I do when my wife

28:27.200 --> 28:29.440
accidentally sees me eating anything.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.000
I stop mid bite until she looks away.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.880
She must not know.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.000
The information of what I look like when I eat

28:36.000 --> 28:37.040
must be kept from her

28:37.040 --> 28:39.360
because I want her to continue to love me and be attracted.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.480
And you do it so quickly.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.000
Yeah, you really need like one of those high-speed cameras

28:44.000 --> 28:45.760
to capture Travis actually eating anything.

28:45.760 --> 28:46.720
Exactly.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.880
What I'm saying though is that when I eat cheese,

28:48.880 --> 28:51.200
I'm making a tremendous personal sacrifice

28:51.200 --> 28:53.520
to get that good, good cheese taste in my mouth.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.200
And the fact that your boyfriend doesn't have my

28:58.800 --> 28:59.920
dietary weakness

29:00.880 --> 29:04.160
and still chooses to squander the gift

29:04.160 --> 29:06.640
that God gave him of a normal stomach,

29:06.640 --> 29:07.600
it makes me sick.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.680
It makes me as sick as a healthy hunk of Gouda would.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.720
You sicken me, sir.

29:14.720 --> 29:20.160
One good way would be to like make a soup, you know?

29:20.960 --> 29:23.120
Like a soup with some shredded cheese in it

29:23.120 --> 29:24.160
and then mix it all up.

29:25.200 --> 29:25.760
She's in it.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.360
Justin, I don't think that she just needs to trick him.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.320
She needs to get him to take a bite of cheese

29:32.320 --> 29:34.800
and then from that point on, he must always eat cheese.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.800
Yeah, I think that's a matter of like,

29:36.800 --> 29:38.160
she wants to just eat cheese.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.280
But maybe if you did it that way,

29:39.280 --> 29:41.280
it's like you ease him into the cheese.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.120
Like you just had secret cheese

29:43.680 --> 29:46.720
and now maybe it's time for you to come out of the cold.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.240
I will say there is something to that

29:48.240 --> 29:50.880
because for a long time, Teresa wouldn't eat eggs.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.240
So it's like, oh, eggs are disgusting.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.440
I do not like eggs.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.920
And then I just kept making them for breakfast,

29:55.920 --> 29:58.240
like for myself, and eventually she was like running late.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.800
She's like, okay, let me, you know, make me an egg.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.320
And now like we eat eggs all the time.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.280
Like she just kind of like became inoculated

30:05.280 --> 30:06.960
to the things she did not like.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.080
That was a really good story.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.840
I like the part in the middle.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.160
Where she started to like eggs again.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.160
The rising action.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.920
She says, no, it stops here.

30:21.920 --> 30:40.320
Brothers, guess what's on my balls.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.680
Travis, you first.

30:41.680 --> 30:42.800
Guess what's on my balls.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.080
Man, I hope it's underpants.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.520
It's underpants.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.960
Oh, what kind.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.720
Griffin for three bonus points.

30:48.720 --> 30:49.680
What's on my balls?

30:49.680 --> 30:50.880
More like boners points.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.880
Okay, thank you, Travis.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.240
You've been eliminated from the game.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.520
Griffin, what's on my balls?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.840
Can I be eliminated from the podcast?

30:57.840 --> 31:00.720
Can I go be on a different podcast for a while?

31:00.720 --> 31:02.960
Well, you're both out of time, unfortunately.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.480
The answer was me undies.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.360
I just need a break.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.120
An official sponsor from my brother, my brother, me,

31:09.120 --> 31:11.760
that is on my balls, but also my butt.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.320
I need some space and I want you to respect

31:14.320 --> 31:16.080
this space that I've requested.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.000
Like the space between your balls and butt

31:18.000 --> 31:19.040
that me undies is also on.

31:19.040 --> 31:19.760
Don't call me.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.400
Me undies, I will call you when I tell you

31:22.400 --> 31:23.920
that I'm ready to jump back in.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.840
Me undies is the most comfortable underwear

31:27.840 --> 31:28.880
you will ever wear.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.840
I thought that was a lie until I started wearing them.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.480
And now I can't wear anything else.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.880
And I don't have enough pairs for that to be hygienic,

31:38.880 --> 31:41.840
but I keep on keeping on because I'm a man of principle.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.000
This is a grungy episode so far.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.120
Grungy is the episode yet.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.840
It's a little raunchy, I think.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.280
They're really, really comfortable.

31:49.280 --> 31:53.840
I, my wife Sydney just got, because they're advertising

31:53.840 --> 31:56.240
on top of this as well, our medical history podcast.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.280
She has tried the ladies underwear too.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.320
She was crazy about them.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.160
They're insanely comfortable.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.000
They're environmentally friendly too.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.080
They use sustainable materials from the Austrian Alps,

32:08.080 --> 32:10.880
no less, which uses a CO2 neutral process

32:10.880 --> 32:11.920
with a little carbon footprint.

32:12.960 --> 32:16.640
They are a great deal too for the quality.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.680
This kind of quality would normally cost you twice as much

32:19.680 --> 32:21.920
as me undies, but there's no retail middleman.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.480
They go directly from the underwear makers to your butt.

32:24.480 --> 32:27.440
I've seen some people ask, is it, yes,

32:27.440 --> 32:32.640
it's more expensive than a 90 pack of underpants

32:32.640 --> 32:35.120
that you buy at like fucking Costco.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.720
Yeah, it's gonna cost you more.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.280
But listen, it's 2015, it's 2015,

32:40.000 --> 32:44.240
and it's time for you to invest in the things

32:44.240 --> 32:45.440
that really matter.

32:45.440 --> 32:48.080
Sometimes you think about something that's more expensive

32:48.080 --> 32:51.120
and you don't see the increase, like the quality increase.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.400
This you do, hands down.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.000
I would pay twice as much as I would for me undies.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.640
I literally, when my me undies are at the top

32:56.640 --> 32:59.120
of the underwear stack, I get a little bit excited.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.640
I get kind of peppy.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.080
I'm like, this is gonna be a good day.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.280
I'm gonna be riding in style.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.600
So you can get these even cheaper though

33:05.600 --> 33:07.040
than they normally are.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.480
Steal them from Justin.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.360
Steal them from me.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.440

33:17.280 --> 33:18.720

33:18.720 --> 33:20.720

33:21.920 --> 33:23.040

33:24.560 --> 33:26.000
Go to meundies.com slash my brother.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.760
Guys, before we move on to the next sponsor,

33:27.760 --> 33:30.000
will this be the time that we get

33:30.000 --> 33:31.680
our first advertiser complaint?

33:31.680 --> 33:35.200
Will this be, I feel like we keep pushing it

33:35.200 --> 33:37.040
and we haven't hit that wall yet.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.120
We've never had an advertiser.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.040
I want you to know Justin, all I can picture

33:41.040 --> 33:43.680
is as we're doing it, there's like a me undies executive

33:43.680 --> 33:45.840
behind the glass in our recording booth,

33:45.840 --> 33:47.920
and he's got like a cigar bit down in his teeth

33:47.920 --> 33:49.280
and he's just thumbs up and shaking.

33:49.280 --> 33:49.760
Thumbs up.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.040
All right, put them on your balls.

33:51.040 --> 33:51.760
Yeah, I love it.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.640
The balls talk.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.160
I love the balls.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.880
Boys, boys, keep talking about your balls.

33:56.880 --> 33:57.920
It's golden.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.320
It's golden.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.080
That's good radio, baby.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.360
Ball stuff.

34:03.360 --> 34:06.320
This is the bread we're proud to be associated with.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.520
You're getting this, right?

34:07.520 --> 34:08.240
You're getting this.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.760
You're getting, you're rolling, right?

34:09.760 --> 34:12.160
This is not just, you're not just checking

34:12.160 --> 34:13.600
the test and the levels out, are you?

34:13.600 --> 34:16.080
They're talking about their balls and you're missing it.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.080
Henry, you're missing it.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.440
This is art.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.440
You're leaving money on the table.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.800
They're talking about their gooch.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
Oh, the ones that something about boners.

34:25.680 --> 34:27.600
This is primo stuff.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.360
He just gets his wallet out and starts throwing hundreds at us.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.600
Can we turn this into an audio billboard?

34:33.600 --> 34:34.320
Is that a thing?

34:35.680 --> 34:37.920
Can we invent those for this moment?

34:37.920 --> 34:40.800
It's just this man standing on a billboard yelling,

34:40.800 --> 34:45.920
guys are talking about their gooch.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.840
You're missing it.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.400
Somebody get me an ice cream van without speakers.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.160
I'm going to play this through the speakers

34:52.160 --> 34:53.200
and drive around town.

34:53.200 --> 34:56.160
This week, MeUndies is sponsored by my brother,

34:56.160 --> 34:57.520
my brother and me.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.840
You gotta listen to this podcast.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.520
They're geniuses, these guys.

35:06.320 --> 35:07.760
Did you get to the boner's bit?

35:07.760 --> 35:08.320
Yes, dad.

35:08.320 --> 35:10.240
Yes, we listened to it.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.880
Did you, but what he says, the boners?

35:12.880 --> 35:13.600
Yeah, yeah.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.120
Steven M. Undies.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.720
Get in here and listen to this episode right now, dad.

35:20.320 --> 35:20.820
Dad.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.000
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.880
We have another spot and we're going to take this one.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.880
We're going to be very serious about it

35:28.880 --> 35:30.160
because you know why?

35:30.160 --> 35:33.200
Cooking and eating is serious business

35:33.200 --> 35:35.600
because if you do it wrong, you could,

35:35.600 --> 35:38.000
you could burn your house down.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.440
You could eat something yucky.

35:39.440 --> 35:39.940
True.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.760
If you fuck up this process,

35:41.760 --> 35:44.400
you could be in dire straits, my friends.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.760
But that is not going to happen

35:45.760 --> 35:48.080
with our next sponsor, Blue Apron.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.920
I'm going to just go off the reservation here,

35:51.920 --> 35:53.280
tell you guys about Blue Apron

35:53.280 --> 35:56.560
because I got a box of Blue Apron this week

35:57.840 --> 35:59.600
and it came with three different meals.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.920
This is a service where they're going to send

36:01.920 --> 36:05.360
the components of three recipes in a box.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.400
In addition to the actual recipe card

36:08.400 --> 36:09.920
that tells you how to make the thing.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.800
And it comes with everything you need to actually cook it.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.000
It's all in the box.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.360
The meat is refrigerated.

36:18.080 --> 36:21.680
It's all like reasonably healthy stuff.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.280
I got three meals this week.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.440
I got a sort of a Mexican casserole,

36:27.440 --> 36:30.720
a pistachio crested catfish

36:30.720 --> 36:35.360
and a sort of chicken coconut milk stew.

36:35.360 --> 36:35.840
Damn.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.400
All three of which were absolutely delicious.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.080
And it's like cooking,

36:40.080 --> 36:42.640
but without all the really boring stuff.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.440
And here's the thing,

36:43.440 --> 36:45.280
like Teresa and I received the same stuff.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
For $9.99 a meal, right?

36:48.000 --> 36:48.960
You get these meals.

36:49.920 --> 36:53.200
Like the Mexican casserole has lasted for like a week.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.480
Like it's so much food for $9.99.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.800
Like for that price, it's a ridiculous.

36:58.800 --> 37:02.080
And it's all so good and like hearty and filling.

37:02.080 --> 37:02.800
It's wonderful.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.000
And relatively low calories.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.280
So 500 to 700 calories per serving for like dinner.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.240
That ain't bad.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.360
And brought right to your door.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.320
Like you don't have to,

37:10.320 --> 37:11.600
you know when you want to make a meal

37:11.600 --> 37:14.560
and you have to like hunt through the supermarket

37:14.560 --> 37:16.080
to find all the different ingredients.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.560
And like sometimes you just need like a teaspoon of salt

37:18.560 --> 37:19.840
and you got to buy a whole thing.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.600
Like, no, this takes out all of that shit.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.880
Comes right to your door.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.160
It's everything you need.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.920
I'm trying to eat healthier in the new year

37:25.920 --> 37:31.600
and a big hiccup for that is ordering food or eating out.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.240
Because you're always going to eat a lot more calories

37:34.240 --> 37:36.320
than you think when you're eating out.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.640
And this just takes off the hardest part,

37:38.640 --> 37:40.080
which is when do I find time to go to the store

37:40.080 --> 37:41.760
to buy the ingredients and everything.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.120
This, it's all done for you.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.160
You just get to do the fun part,

37:44.160 --> 37:46.400
which is cooking it and also eating it.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.520
And right now, if you go to blueapron.com slash my brother,

37:49.520 --> 37:51.280
you'll get two free meals.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.840
Like that's an amazing deal.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.200
Like two free meals.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.120
Why aren't you already doing this and checking it out?

37:57.760 --> 37:58.720
Yeah, check it out.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.040
Send us pictures of what you cook so I can get hungry

38:01.680 --> 38:04.560
and eat it and come to your house and sell your food.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.280
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

38:07.280 --> 38:11.120
Blueapron.com slash my brother.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.880
I have a message for Mr. Dan Bailey Yavondit.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.640
You guys think I crossed that last name or?

38:16.640 --> 38:17.200
Yes, I do.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.400
I think you did.

38:18.960 --> 38:23.040
Mr. Dan Bailey Yavondit or Yavondite?

38:23.040 --> 38:25.120
Okay, second time wasn't as good.

38:26.480 --> 38:29.600
And it's from Frankenkitty, who says,

38:29.600 --> 38:31.040
Hey, DBY.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.440
Thank you, Frankenkitty, for that kindness.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.080
Hey, DBY.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.960
Remember that time you and I repeatedly tripped

38:38.960 --> 38:42.320
that feeble-minded blue dragon until it died?

38:42.880 --> 38:45.280
It was like a D&D schoolboy.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.160
Happy birthday.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.000
All right.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.120
Is this a drugs thing?

38:50.240 --> 38:51.760
Is this a drugs thing?

38:51.760 --> 38:54.400
I'm tripping on that feeble-minded blue dragon.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.480
That could be like a strain of kush.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.880
Like they get pretty clever with those names.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.040
Maybe it's like ropey vapor.

39:01.040 --> 39:04.240
It's a ropey blue strain, and we're gonna call it

39:04.240 --> 39:05.520
feeble-minded blue dragon.

39:06.400 --> 39:06.960
Smoke it.

39:06.960 --> 39:07.760
Happy birthday.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.320
Smoke it, toke it, roll it up and poke it, baby.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.880
Roll it up and what now?

39:12.880 --> 39:14.000
Roll it up and poke it.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.600
This is a primo strain.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.320
Thank you very much.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.000
Happy birthday, DBY.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.240
Happy birthday.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.480
This primo message is for Pat.

39:20.480 --> 39:21.920
Did I use that correctly?

39:22.800 --> 39:26.400
And it's from the primo Alex.

39:26.400 --> 39:26.880
Yeah?

39:26.880 --> 39:28.160
Are you making fun of me?

39:28.160 --> 39:28.960
No, not at all.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.360
Happy two-year anniversary to my ruggedly handsome,

39:31.360 --> 39:34.320
super-duper strong, incredibly intelligent boyfriend, Pat.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.400
You are the only person who makes me laugh

39:36.400 --> 39:37.280
more than the macrobe does.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.240
I don't like that.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.360
What the fuck?

39:39.360 --> 39:40.960
And that is how I know I love you.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.280
I hope this embarrasses you just the right amount.

39:43.280 --> 39:43.840
Love, Alex.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.200
Not too much, not too little.

39:45.200 --> 39:45.840
Just the right amount.

39:45.840 --> 39:46.800
Just the right amount.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.360
I feel-

39:47.360 --> 39:50.240
Do you really have to get on our show

39:50.240 --> 39:52.800
and throw around your money to insult us?

39:52.800 --> 39:55.280
I would like to see Pat come here and talk about butts

39:55.280 --> 39:57.600
and boners and taints and pizza.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.000
Hey, Pat, why don't you come into our house

40:00.000 --> 40:00.960
and talk that shit?

40:00.960 --> 40:02.160
Pat, you bringing the heat?

40:02.160 --> 40:03.200
Because we'll step.

40:03.200 --> 40:03.840
We'll step.

40:03.840 --> 40:06.640
We'll go outside and we'll make jokes at each other

40:06.640 --> 40:08.080
until one of us falls down.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.960
I hope the next episode has a sponsored message

40:10.960 --> 40:12.960
where somebody just sends us a list of people

40:12.960 --> 40:14.960
that they think are funnier than we are.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.920
I hope the next episode is you guys and Pat and I'm out.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.520
This message is from Jake

40:19.520 --> 40:21.520
and it was sent in by David

40:21.520 --> 40:22.400
and it says,

40:23.040 --> 40:24.480
all the Wayans brothers.

40:28.240 --> 40:28.880
That's it?

40:28.880 --> 40:29.760
That's it.

40:29.760 --> 40:30.480
They're the only-

40:30.480 --> 40:31.280
That's it, all the Wayans brothers.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.280
And fucking Pat, apparently.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.920
Mr. Jerks on Pat.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.040
If it's Pat and Oswald, then yes.

40:39.040 --> 40:39.520
Yeah, that's fine.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.840
Happy anniversary, Patrick Duffy.

40:41.840 --> 40:42.640
Patrick Duffy.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.080
There's a lot of Patricks funnier than us.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.160
A lot of Patricks funnier than us.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.120
Oh, well.

40:49.120 --> 40:50.080
Win some, you lose some.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.600
Happy anniversary, Alex and Pat.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.720
Hey, this is Pop Rocket.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.440
We're your source for all pop culture information.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.760
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark-filled discussion

40:59.760 --> 41:02.960
about pop culture by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.320
No name calling, no rudeness,

41:04.320 --> 41:06.000
just straight talk and a lot of role play.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.600
I'm only 30-something for another year.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.480
Me too.

41:08.480 --> 41:11.040
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

41:11.040 --> 41:15.040
Pop Rocket comes out every week from MaximumFun.org.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.200
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

41:18.480 --> 41:19.440
Yes, I guess.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.000
I guess.

41:20.000 --> 41:20.560
I do.

41:20.560 --> 41:20.880
Sorry.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.680
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.320
The best, the best, the best around.

41:26.320 --> 41:26.800
Thank you, Drew.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.760
They got suspended.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.960
They did a bad word.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.600
When they existed, when they lived.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.080
And let's honor their memory by talking about their question

41:38.080 --> 41:40.000
and answering it, providing them some relief.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.800
They asked, poll, who is the sexiest green guy?

41:46.240 --> 41:47.520
Because I am bored.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.760
Check this fucking dope answer out.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.760
And this is their own answer.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.320
Enzo Matrix from Reboot for me.

41:54.320 --> 41:58.800
Size, hunky, you, open to men as well.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.760
Well, yeah.

41:59.760 --> 42:00.800
You can't, you can't.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.840
All right, just try and fucking bar me from this conversation.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.200
They have to mean the adult Enzo, right?

42:07.200 --> 42:08.080
Not like little kid.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.080
This is Enzo when he goes off into the-

42:10.080 --> 42:12.560
Oh yeah, when he gets lost in the internet and he comes back

42:12.560 --> 42:13.840
and he looks fucking awesome.

42:13.840 --> 42:16.800
He looks like Solid Snake, but green and fucking hunky as fuck.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.720
The first person that getting lost in the internet

42:18.720 --> 42:20.160
has ever helped, ever.

42:20.160 --> 42:20.480
Yeah.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.880
He got lost in the internet and got real fit.

42:22.880 --> 42:25.680
I think he lost an eye though, which is like, yeah,

42:25.680 --> 42:26.320
that'll happen.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.080
I think he did.

42:28.080 --> 42:31.120
And I'm really mad at myself because I could not remember

42:31.120 --> 42:35.440
what the main dude in Reboot was named.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.840
I think his name was Jeff Reboot.

42:37.840 --> 42:38.320
Jeff Reboot.

42:40.240 --> 42:40.880
Jeff Reboot.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.120
Jeff Reboot.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.880
Well, time for a Google break.

42:47.840 --> 42:48.640
Bob.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.040
Bob.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.560
Bob, of course.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.120
Bob.

42:51.120 --> 42:53.040
That's a fucking good answer.

42:53.040 --> 42:56.960
It is very rare that Game Recognized Game on Yahoo answers.

42:56.960 --> 43:00.000
By Game Recognized, God, I wish I knew this person's name.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.400
I wish they had not been suspended.

43:02.400 --> 43:03.920
What about Roger Klotz?

43:04.720 --> 43:06.320
That's pretty good.

43:06.320 --> 43:09.600
He's a bad boy, but you could tell he had a good heart.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.200
And a fucking smoking body.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.360
In the later years, there was like a Doug, the new class,

43:16.160 --> 43:17.440
but it was the same class.

43:17.440 --> 43:20.160
They were just older, so kind of a dumb name for the show.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.440
But Klotz is looking good.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.680
He was doing lots of fucking reps at the gym

43:23.680 --> 43:25.600
and his body looked really good.

43:25.600 --> 43:25.840
Yeah.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.640
I'm trying to think of other green people.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.040
Trek.

43:32.160 --> 43:34.400
I know he's not everybody's style,

43:34.400 --> 43:36.560
but he's really funny.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.240
He's made me laugh a lot harder than...

43:39.040 --> 43:41.280
Put him on the list above, I think, even the way...

43:41.280 --> 43:42.960
Not a top-notch butt.

43:43.520 --> 43:44.800
No, the butt's not great.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.120
It's just because it's not rendered especially well.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.800
Great work, dream works.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.720
But I will say that the stink would be bad

43:52.720 --> 43:54.160
because he's a swamp monster.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.280
Is the Jolly Green Giant out?

44:01.360 --> 44:04.000
Maybe if you're into Vore, it's a pretty sweet way to go.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.840
What are you fucking talking about?

44:05.840 --> 44:06.560
Start over.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.240
The Jolly Green Giant.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.040
I got that part.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.080
I heard the name, Travis.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.000
Is he out?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.360
How does he Vore anybody?

44:13.360 --> 44:14.160
He doesn't walk around fucking-

44:14.160 --> 44:15.200
Because he's giant.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.600
He's giant and he eats people for eating his children.

44:18.640 --> 44:19.120
You understand-

44:19.120 --> 44:20.000
Ho, ho, ho.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.400
You ate my children, now I'll eat you.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.640
That's not what he does.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.640
I think I remember that commercial, Griffin.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.000
Also, if you knew anything about Vore,

44:30.000 --> 44:30.800
if you ever fucking...

44:30.800 --> 44:31.360
I listen...

44:31.360 --> 44:33.040
Oh God, I listen to Bunker Buddies all the time.

44:33.040 --> 44:35.280
You've never listened to a single fucking episode of BigGolf,

44:35.280 --> 44:35.760
or else you'd understand-

44:35.760 --> 44:36.720
I can't find it.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.760
Or else you'd understand...

44:37.760 --> 44:40.560
I've sent you the fucking deep web links.

44:40.560 --> 44:43.680
You would understand that when a giant swallows something,

44:43.680 --> 44:44.720
like a giant, giant...

44:44.720 --> 44:47.280
Like Gulliver's Travels swallows a person,

44:47.280 --> 44:50.880
it's not good Vore because you don't get squished down in there.

44:50.880 --> 44:54.160
It needs to be a little bit bigger than a human swallowing a human,

44:54.160 --> 44:57.200
and they get bulked up and you can see the fucking impressions

44:57.200 --> 44:58.640
of their body inside the body.

44:58.640 --> 44:59.280
You don't know fucking anything.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.560
I don't wanna talk about Vore anymore.

45:01.680 --> 45:02.560
Repeat the question.

45:02.560 --> 45:03.040
Let's start...

45:03.040 --> 45:03.840
Let's take it back to the beginning

45:03.840 --> 45:04.960
because I want a concrete answer.

45:04.960 --> 45:06.400
Poll, who's the sexiest green guy?

45:07.360 --> 45:08.240
Are there answers?

45:08.240 --> 45:08.880
Are there any answers?

45:08.880 --> 45:10.240
Yeah, the Jolly Green Giant is on here,

45:10.240 --> 45:11.440
but apparently you struck him from the list

45:11.440 --> 45:14.000
because he walks around fucking murdering people by swallowing them

45:14.000 --> 45:17.600
and dissolving them in his giant green stomach acid.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.400
He's too big.

45:18.400 --> 45:21.120
I can't imagine making love to him for he is far too large.

45:21.680 --> 45:23.200
Can I hit you guys with this?

45:23.200 --> 45:24.400
How does Gumby grab you?

45:24.400 --> 45:24.720
Gumby's...

45:25.280 --> 45:25.780
Yeah.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.000
Because you can do whatever you want.

45:28.000 --> 45:28.500
Yeah.

45:29.600 --> 45:29.760
Yeah.

45:29.760 --> 45:30.160
I like that.

45:30.160 --> 45:31.200
That's a solid answer.

45:31.200 --> 45:32.560
I put him in top five.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.040
His body's not like great.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.840
He's a little bit better than Shrek, I guess,

45:37.840 --> 45:40.320
but you could mold some six pack onto him.

45:40.320 --> 45:40.880
That's what I'm saying.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.240
Or just carve it in.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.680
He's just like rubber.

45:44.880 --> 45:45.920
I don't think he'd love that.

45:46.800 --> 45:50.160
The Incredible Hulk is on this.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.440
He's got anger issues.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.880
He doesn't have a good personality.

45:52.880 --> 45:53.760
Are we talking about like,

45:54.880 --> 45:56.640
who do you wanna just like make love to

45:56.640 --> 45:58.640
or like who could you see yourself with?

45:58.640 --> 45:59.520
It's sexiest.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.760
So I think it's just like an erotic thing.

46:01.760 --> 46:02.080
Okay.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.280
Then I'll give you a Hulk,

46:03.280 --> 46:04.880
especially like newer Hulk.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.240
That old Hulk had a very like square face.

46:08.240 --> 46:09.440
I wasn't into that.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.280
Eric Bana,

46:11.280 --> 46:12.640
Ruffalo Buffalo,

46:12.640 --> 46:14.960
or Ed Norton.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.360
It's Ruffalo Buffalo.

46:18.320 --> 46:19.200
See, I'd go Bixbo.

46:19.200 --> 46:22.160
He's got that rugged 1970s sexuality

46:22.160 --> 46:23.440
that really works for me.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.880
Well, that's a good point.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.160
Or Farigna.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.240
Yeah, Farigna.

46:28.240 --> 46:31.520
You could fucking bounce a dime off Farigna.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.640
God damn.

46:32.640 --> 46:33.520
Any part of him.

46:33.520 --> 46:34.640
He does not like it,

46:34.640 --> 46:35.280
but you can do it.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.040
Quit throwing dimes at Lou Farigna.

46:37.040 --> 46:37.840
Confuses him.

46:37.840 --> 46:41.200
I bet that the Grinch post-conversion

46:41.200 --> 46:43.360
would be a very giving lover.

46:43.360 --> 46:45.120
Oh, he's got so much to give, you know?

46:45.120 --> 46:46.800
And he's a little bit shy

46:46.800 --> 46:48.400
because he's never really done this before.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.720
Listen, his heart wasn't the only thing

46:50.720 --> 46:51.680
that grew three sides.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.440
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

46:53.440 --> 46:58.880
Also, his hoopiness.

46:58.880 --> 46:59.600
I'm not even trying.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.160
That was funny.

47:00.880 --> 47:03.280
Let's just say I've got a 39 and a half foot pole

47:03.280 --> 47:04.320
that I would touch him with.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.600
This is a dumb podcast.

47:17.760 --> 47:18.960
One of these motherfuckers

47:18.960 --> 47:20.240
said Captain Planet.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.720
Stop, stop.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.480
He's blue, you dumb idiot.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.120
He's kind of like an aquamarine.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.400
He's like a teal.

47:28.400 --> 47:30.000
Yeah, maybe if you had like a busted

47:30.000 --> 47:31.200
old shitty television

47:31.200 --> 47:33.040
that couldn't get colors right, idiot.

47:33.600 --> 47:34.800
Are there any green women?

47:34.800 --> 47:36.240
All these are dudes.

47:36.880 --> 47:37.920
Oh, the green M&M.

47:38.800 --> 47:39.760
Ding dong.

47:40.960 --> 47:41.920
The bit is dead.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.280
What times are acceptable for text messaging

47:49.280 --> 47:50.480
a friend or family member?

47:50.480 --> 47:51.440
This is a good question.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.080
Yeah, it is.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.640
I would say it's an important question

47:54.640 --> 47:56.560
for this trio of people.

47:56.560 --> 47:57.600
I wouldn't think of calling someone

47:57.600 --> 47:58.880
during traditional sleepy hours.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.640
I find myself sending text messages

48:00.640 --> 48:04.080
regardless of the time of day or night.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.360
No one complains,

48:05.360 --> 48:07.120
but wonder if I should restrict my texting

48:07.120 --> 48:08.000
in the same hours.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.080
I restrict my non-emergency phone calls.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.080
That's from Terrible Textor in...

48:13.280 --> 48:15.200
That's Minnesota, you stupid dummy.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.040
Okay, let me start off by asking this.

48:19.040 --> 48:22.240
What are the approved hours for phone calls?

48:22.240 --> 48:23.920
Is it like nine to nine?

48:23.920 --> 48:27.680
Okay, so I think if you don't know the person

48:28.320 --> 48:31.360
before nine o'clock is okay.

48:31.360 --> 48:33.280
I think if it's a family member

48:33.280 --> 48:35.120
before 11 o'clock is okay.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.880
What do you mean PM?

48:38.480 --> 48:39.520
This is my fault.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.640
This is my fault.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.640
My anger issues towards the two of you,

48:42.640 --> 48:43.920
mostly Justin because Travis,

48:43.920 --> 48:45.280
you're way behind us now.

48:45.280 --> 48:48.320
I'm in bed at 10.30.

48:48.320 --> 48:51.840
I'm in bed at 10.30

48:51.840 --> 48:55.200
because I need nine hours to be trying to sleep

48:55.200 --> 48:56.720
because I can usually only squeeze

48:56.720 --> 48:58.480
about eight good ones out of it.

48:58.480 --> 48:59.520
Out of a nine hour block,

48:59.520 --> 49:02.080
I usually lose an hour to tossing and turning

49:02.080 --> 49:03.440
and pee breaks.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.280
I'm trying to remember words to songs.

49:05.280 --> 49:05.520
Yep.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.480
That's what always gets me.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.760
Justin, when you text me after 11

49:09.760 --> 49:14.880
to tell me that you're really into haunted dolls now.

49:14.880 --> 49:17.920
But Griffin, that couldn't wait till morning.

49:17.920 --> 49:19.760
That's information you need to know now

49:19.760 --> 49:21.680
in order to complete your night sleep.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.440
I would have sent it to you another time,

49:23.440 --> 49:24.880
but I was drunk then.

49:26.720 --> 49:27.680
Wait, so Griffin,

49:27.680 --> 49:29.280
do you not silence your cell phone

49:29.840 --> 49:30.880
when you go to bed?

49:30.880 --> 49:33.280
Travis, that wakes me up.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.880
Okay, hold on one second.

49:35.680 --> 49:39.120
I sent that text to you at 12.05 local

49:39.120 --> 49:40.640
on a Saturday,

49:40.640 --> 49:46.080
which is 11.05 p.m. on a Saturday night for you.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.520
How old are you?

49:47.520 --> 49:48.000
Seriously.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.200
I'm 27 years old.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.840
That doesn't change what my fucking body wants

49:51.840 --> 49:53.040
and what my body needs,

49:53.040 --> 49:54.560
which is nine hours of sleep to get-

49:54.560 --> 49:55.840
11 o'clock on a Saturday?

49:55.840 --> 49:57.680
I had also been drinking all day,

49:57.680 --> 50:00.800
especially hard after my goddamn Packers shit the bed.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.360
Put two good turds right there in the bed.

50:03.360 --> 50:04.320
Good work, Packers.

50:04.320 --> 50:05.680
Good work, Bostick.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.040
Great job, Packers.

50:07.040 --> 50:08.560
Packers Super Bowl-

50:08.560 --> 50:09.920
Is that on Saturday?

50:09.920 --> 50:10.960
No, it was Sunday, wasn't it?

50:14.160 --> 50:16.640
What was I doing Saturday?

50:18.240 --> 50:22.400
Apparently going to bed before fucking the news,

50:22.400 --> 50:23.360
like a pep hall.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.960
I wake up at seven in the morning,

50:24.960 --> 50:26.320
regardless of what day it is,

50:26.320 --> 50:27.360
and I start working

50:28.320 --> 50:31.760
because I'm on that Malcolm Gladwell outlier shit.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.360
I'm trying to get 10,000 hours in

50:33.360 --> 50:35.840
of a few activities before I shuffle off this mortal coil,

50:35.840 --> 50:37.200
and in order to do that, I get a jumpstart

50:37.200 --> 50:40.480
because that's when my brain is fucking firing,

50:40.480 --> 50:41.600
firing on all cylinders.

50:41.600 --> 50:42.880
You text me at 11 o'clock,

50:42.880 --> 50:44.560
my next day is all about that text.

50:45.200 --> 50:48.480
You also didn't respond to the text until like 1.50 the next day.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.080
Yeah, because I was unconscious.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.080
He needed to take in the information

50:52.080 --> 50:54.880
and really mull it over before texting back.

50:54.880 --> 50:56.800
I needed to stop hating you,

50:56.800 --> 50:58.880
and it took me 13 hours to get there.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.080
Okay, fine.

51:02.080 --> 51:05.120
So I will also say that Travis is the worst.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.800
Well, I'm three hours behind you guys,

51:06.800 --> 51:07.920
and I'm still getting used to the fact

51:07.920 --> 51:10.160
that if I text you at nine, it's midnight your time.

51:10.720 --> 51:11.200
Yeah.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.880
But you get incensed when we text you

51:12.880 --> 51:14.560
when it's seven o'clock your time.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.560
Well, because that's my time.

51:16.560 --> 51:17.440
You know what I mean?

51:17.440 --> 51:19.360
That affects me negatively,

51:20.320 --> 51:21.360
not the other way around.

51:22.160 --> 51:23.520
Dad is also very bad.

51:23.520 --> 51:25.040
Dad, of all the three of us,

51:25.040 --> 51:26.240
Dad doesn't give a fuck.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.600
Dad will text you at four o'clock in the morning

51:29.600 --> 51:31.280
to ask you if you remember who that guy was

51:31.280 --> 51:32.720
on that one episode of Doctor Who.

51:32.720 --> 51:35.680
I can be on stage on inauguration day

51:35.680 --> 51:37.280
being sworn in as president,

51:37.280 --> 51:38.480
and Dad's like,

51:38.480 --> 51:39.120
hey, yo, what's up?

51:39.120 --> 51:40.240
You watch Arrow?

51:40.240 --> 51:41.200
Like, no, I don't.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.880
I never watched Arrow.

51:43.680 --> 51:44.960
He at least, he's gotten better

51:44.960 --> 51:46.240
because he used to just text like,

51:46.240 --> 51:47.600
call me ASAP.

51:47.600 --> 51:48.720
And then you'd call him and go,

51:48.720 --> 51:49.760
what was that movie?

51:49.760 --> 51:50.160
What happened?

51:50.160 --> 51:50.640
Who's dead?

51:50.640 --> 51:51.920
Yo, did you watch Arrow?

51:53.520 --> 51:55.120
He at least not just text the question.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.560
Arrow last night was sick.

51:57.520 --> 52:01.200
Our dad has done morning shifts in radio

52:01.200 --> 52:02.800
for like three decades.

52:02.800 --> 52:08.320
So he always wakes up at about 4, 4.30.

52:08.320 --> 52:10.720
So by like 6.30 AM,

52:10.720 --> 52:12.320
Dad's day is in full swing.

52:14.000 --> 52:14.880
And for Travis,

52:14.880 --> 52:16.960
that's 3.30 in the fucking morning.

52:16.960 --> 52:19.280
For me, it is still 6.30,

52:19.280 --> 52:20.720
which is still crazy.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.280
Just like-

52:21.280 --> 52:22.080
I look forward to the day

52:22.080 --> 52:24.720
when the text message just appears in my dream

52:24.720 --> 52:25.280
and it's just like,

52:25.280 --> 52:27.040
we have to get away from these zombies.

52:27.040 --> 52:28.720
Also, who was that guy in Doctor Who?

52:28.720 --> 52:29.440
Ask your dad.

52:29.440 --> 52:33.040
Just, I just play it safe.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.840
After 10 AM Pacific time.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.480
So after 1 PM Eastern time

52:38.480 --> 52:42.560
to like 9.30 PM Eastern time.

52:42.560 --> 52:43.600
Those are the texting hours.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.640
You get eight and a half hours

52:44.640 --> 52:45.600
to get your texts off.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.120
So make them fucking count.

52:47.120 --> 52:47.840
Cause afterwards it's dead.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.240
If anybody listening can make iPhone

52:50.240 --> 52:51.200
or make apps,

52:51.200 --> 52:53.360
make an app that automatically

52:53.360 --> 52:56.160
you set the time when it starts and stops.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.800
It just like holds all incoming texts

52:58.800 --> 53:01.120
messages and phone calls until it ends.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.160
I think they have that.

53:02.160 --> 53:02.400
You're welcome.

53:02.400 --> 53:03.600
I think they have that though.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.480
I think they have do not disturb times,

53:06.480 --> 53:07.600
but it only passes through

53:07.600 --> 53:10.080
if they like text 911 or something like that.

53:10.080 --> 53:12.720
But I'll still get a 911 text about Arrow.

53:12.720 --> 53:20.640
You've been listening to our comedy advice podcast.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.080
We're brother, my brother and me.

53:22.080 --> 53:24.000
We hope you've had a lot of fun here today.

53:24.000 --> 53:24.880
I hope you learned something.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.560
I hope you grew as a person.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.680
A few little housekeeping things.

53:29.680 --> 53:35.200
We put our live shows on sale on Friday,

53:35.200 --> 53:35.840
I guess, right?

53:35.840 --> 53:38.480
Friday at noon, central standard time.

53:39.360 --> 53:40.400
They sold out.

53:40.400 --> 53:41.760
Two of the shows were sold out.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.240
Our Chicago show has sold out.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.600
It sold out about six minutes.

53:45.600 --> 53:47.120
So don't feel bad if you didn't get tickets.

53:49.040 --> 53:51.440
We are trying to figure out a way

53:51.440 --> 53:53.440
to like get some more tickets available

53:53.440 --> 53:55.280
because we know there's a lot of people

53:55.280 --> 53:56.640
in Chicago that want to come.

53:56.640 --> 54:00.560
So we're trying to do something

54:02.080 --> 54:04.800
to alleviate that problem for you.

54:05.600 --> 54:09.440
But you should keep it tuned to our Twitter and our Facebook.

54:09.440 --> 54:13.600
If we do come up with some sort of solution for this issue,

54:13.600 --> 54:16.160
we try to give you as much heads up as possible.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.920
We're being broad because we don't know what it is yet.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.480
If we had something to announce, I swear we would.

54:21.600 --> 54:22.320
It sucks.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.480
Like we're going to figure something out.

54:24.480 --> 54:26.400
It's just we don't know what it is yet.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.520
So please stay tuned.

54:27.520 --> 54:29.680
And I'll say this, if we do something,

54:29.680 --> 54:31.440
figure something out before we record again,

54:31.440 --> 54:33.600
before we can announce it on the show,

54:34.640 --> 54:37.680
if you bought tickets to one of the shows

54:38.400 --> 54:41.520
and we managed to get extra tickets on sale in Chicago,

54:41.520 --> 54:43.440
please, if you already have tickets to another show,

54:43.440 --> 54:44.080
please don't buy them.

54:44.080 --> 54:45.280
I know that's shitty to ask you

54:45.280 --> 54:47.440
not to support us or whatever.

54:47.440 --> 54:50.320
But the idea of us doing shows this year

54:50.320 --> 54:51.760
and trying to do a bunch of live shows

54:51.760 --> 54:53.200
all across the country this year

54:53.200 --> 54:54.240
is that we want to get out

54:54.240 --> 54:56.480
and see people that we haven't seen before

54:56.480 --> 54:59.920
or that we haven't seen since 2008 or something.

54:59.920 --> 55:02.000
So please, that was before we did the podcast,

55:02.000 --> 55:02.880
but you know what I mean?

55:02.880 --> 55:07.120
Please just stick to the one, I think.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.280
That's Griffin's perspective.

55:09.280 --> 55:11.120
My perspective is I don't give a shit, man.

55:11.120 --> 55:13.280
Emily still spends a lot of money.

55:13.280 --> 55:15.120
We do want to say thank you to everyone in Chicago.

55:15.120 --> 55:15.840
That's a ridiculous amount of support.

55:15.840 --> 55:17.680
That's fucking insane, yeah.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.040
And seeing everybody go,

55:19.040 --> 55:21.520
please, I must see the show, do something.

55:21.520 --> 55:22.880
We are listening and we are trying.

55:22.880 --> 55:23.600
We're trying.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.800
We're trying to do something.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.600
Listen to the other Max Fun shows.

55:27.600 --> 55:30.800
We each, I mean, we have some extra ones

55:30.800 --> 55:32.160
if you like to listen to our dumb voices.

55:32.160 --> 55:34.160
Travis has Bunker Buddies, like he does with Andy.

55:34.800 --> 55:36.560
Justin has Sawbones, like he does with Sydney.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.720
We all do The Adventure Zone with our dad.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.560
Episode five for that dropped last week.

55:41.760 --> 55:43.200
Did we tweet, by the way,

55:43.200 --> 55:44.560
that this episode was gonna be a day late

55:44.560 --> 55:45.520
because of the holiday?

55:45.520 --> 55:46.560
I think they'll figure it out.

55:47.280 --> 55:47.760
Yeah, I hope so.

55:47.760 --> 55:48.960
When it comes up.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.240
No one's complained about it yet,

55:50.240 --> 55:52.880
so I'm thinking that they must realize

55:52.880 --> 55:54.560
that with being on holiday here in the US.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.920
Okay, well, there's a lot of really good

55:57.920 --> 55:59.280
Max Fun shows to go listen to.

55:59.280 --> 56:00.800
There's a new one, Pop Rocket.

56:01.440 --> 56:04.320
It's a show about all things pop cultural.

56:05.040 --> 56:06.800
You can find that on Maximum Fun.

56:06.800 --> 56:07.360
It's really funny.

56:07.360 --> 56:09.360
I listened to the pilot episode last week.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.480
Yeah, it's really good.

56:10.480 --> 56:14.720
I also, I did a guest spot on a non-Max Fun podcast

56:14.720 --> 56:19.120
called The K.O. with Kurt Braunohler, K-O-H-L-E.

56:19.120 --> 56:20.080
It's on The Nerdist.

56:20.080 --> 56:22.320
And it's a multi-format podcast

56:22.320 --> 56:24.400
where sometimes they talk about their pets

56:24.400 --> 56:26.640
and sometimes they talk about boats.

56:26.640 --> 56:29.680
But on this episode, it was a format called Get Lost

56:29.680 --> 56:32.080
where he blindfolded me and drove me through LA

56:32.080 --> 56:33.920
and took me to a really cool location

56:33.920 --> 56:35.840
and interviewed me on the way there.

56:36.640 --> 56:38.160
It's coming out the same day that this comes out,

56:38.160 --> 56:39.040
so go check that out.

56:39.600 --> 56:40.960
I'll post a link to it on Twitter

56:40.960 --> 56:42.000
and in the Facebook group.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.760
You listened to that show and researched shit

56:45.760 --> 56:48.000
before you agreed to get kidnapped, right?

56:48.000 --> 56:48.400
Correct.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.640
I actually am a really huge fan of the show

56:50.640 --> 56:51.840
and I was really happy to be on it.

56:51.840 --> 56:54.160
So if you're looking for a show to listen to,

56:54.720 --> 56:56.160
The K.O. it's really great.

56:56.160 --> 56:56.640
Is that it?

56:58.560 --> 56:59.760
Send in some questions, please,

57:00.560 --> 57:01.440
for the live shows that we're doing

57:01.440 --> 57:02.640
in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.400
If you're gonna be at either of those shows,

57:05.040 --> 57:07.360
we're doing LA February 6th

57:07.360 --> 57:09.040
and San Francisco February 7th.

57:09.040 --> 57:10.560
I think they might be both sold out.

57:10.560 --> 57:12.640
Are there still tickets available for Sketch Fest?

57:12.640 --> 57:13.840
No, they're both sold out.

57:13.840 --> 57:15.040
They're both sold out.

57:15.040 --> 57:15.280
Sorry, guys.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.640
This is the first time we'll ever do

57:16.640 --> 57:19.040
like back-to-back days of shows, really.

57:19.040 --> 57:21.360
So we need a bunch of questions.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.440
So just send us all the good questions you can.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.920
If you're going to the LA show,

57:26.800 --> 57:29.680
we kind of have to do a change of plans.

57:29.680 --> 57:30.720
Justin, you wanna talk about it?

57:31.520 --> 57:31.760
Yeah.

57:32.800 --> 57:35.840
So we were supposed to have Sawbones opening that show

57:35.840 --> 57:39.120
and Sawbones is of course me and my wife, Sydney,

57:39.120 --> 57:42.800
but is also in some ways my baby

57:43.920 --> 57:46.400
who we did a little bit of traveling

57:46.400 --> 57:47.600
during the Christmas holidays

57:47.600 --> 57:49.360
and she did not do so hot with it.

57:49.360 --> 57:53.280
But apparently babies are really into routine and stuff.

57:53.280 --> 57:56.160
So as a result, we're gonna have to,

57:56.160 --> 58:00.160
Sawbones is gonna have to bow out of the shows in LA,

58:00.160 --> 58:01.120
or the show in LA.

58:02.080 --> 58:05.200
So that is, that bums us out heavily

58:05.200 --> 58:06.640
and we are very sorry, but...

58:07.840 --> 58:11.360
That doesn't mean you're gonna get less podcasts.

58:12.240 --> 58:13.840
Let's see, how can we be vague about this?

58:13.840 --> 58:15.600
There will be two podcasts there.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.600
Mabim Bam will be one of them.

58:17.600 --> 58:20.960
The other podcast, special guest surprise podcast.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.560
Premier, a world premiere episode.

58:24.560 --> 58:28.960
Well, a live show premiere of a special guest podcast

58:30.640 --> 58:33.440
that you will only get to catch if you're in LA.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.200
Yes.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.640
So we're very excited to be partnering up with them.

58:40.560 --> 58:43.200
I think it's a relationship that we've been building

58:43.200 --> 58:45.760
for a long time and I think you're-

58:45.760 --> 58:47.040
And we're sorry about Sawbones.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.320
I know that's hard to swallow,

58:48.880 --> 58:52.560
but I think that this new addition is gonna be great too.

58:52.560 --> 58:53.360
Yeah.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.120
We also wanna say thanks again to MeUndies

58:55.120 --> 58:56.640

59:18.080 --> 59:19.360

59:19.360 --> 59:21.920
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:21.920 --> 59:24.800
They won't send you free food or cheap undies,

59:24.800 --> 59:26.960
but they will give you good, good tunes.

59:26.960 --> 59:27.840
Oh, before I forget,

59:31.600 --> 59:34.240
but you don't have iTunes or you can't find it anywhere,

59:35.120 --> 59:37.760
we made videos of all five episodes so far

59:37.760 --> 59:39.120
and put them on our YouTube channel.

59:39.120 --> 59:41.920

Thank you.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:03.920
One more question.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.520
Yeah, I thought we'd just like do the thing

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.280
that we've done 234 times already.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:07.600
Okay.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.440
This final Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.160
Thank you, Drew.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.200
All Drew episode.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.000
Been a while.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.560
Thank you, Drew.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Brie Bella and Nick

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.480
who asks a shared account.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.240
They can't be trusted individually

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.720
with the responsibility of handling their own accounts.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.080
There's a dual account.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.600
Brie and Nick ask

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.720
question about the TV show Small Wonder.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.000
Was Vicky a doll with someone doing her voice

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.520
or was she a real human?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.880
I'm Justin McRoy.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.080
I'm Travis McRoy.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.760
She was a haunted doll.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.640
Haunted doll watch.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.600
It's the best new bit.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.720
All my brother and my brother and me

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.600

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.480
I'm Griffin McRoy.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.720
It's been a little bit of weather.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.160
My brother and me kiss your dad.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.160
Sway on the lips.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.080

Hello, buddies.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.840
I'm Travis McRoy.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.720
And I'm Andy Bolt.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.880
And we're the host of Bunker Buddies.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.520
We're a podcast where we're amateur survivalists

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.600
and we talk about things like the apocalypse.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.080
And we talk about zombies and preparedness.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.400
What are you gonna wear when it's the apocalypse?

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400
And you have no idea if you don't listen to our show.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.880
It comes out every Wednesdays on Maximumfun.org

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.840
and on iTunes.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.440
Sometimes we try weird foods

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.960
or we talk about where to camp

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.560
or how to avoid getting eaten

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.840
or any of these things.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.800
Yeah, so listen to us

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.720
because it might just save your life.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.160
We'll see you in the bunker.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:02:10.160
Bye.
