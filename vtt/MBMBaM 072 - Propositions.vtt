00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.920
Welcome to my brother, my brother made an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.920 --> 00:56.000
You can smell it in the air. Crisp, inviting, warm scent of the pumpkin spice latte.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.880
It's back and we're celebrating. I just had my first one of of this of 2011.

01:03.520 --> 01:10.960
Yeah, I still have. I finished it moments ago, mere moments ago. I went with the PSL with no

01:11.600 --> 01:18.160
whip on top, went skim milk in it. I love the idea of I love seasonal flavors,

01:18.160 --> 01:22.240
like the idea of like peppermint, everything in winter. But if it were like summer and someone's

01:22.240 --> 01:26.160
like, do you want some peppermint coffee? I'm like, no, fuck you. Fuck that. And fuck you

01:26.160 --> 01:31.120
for that idea of pumpkin muffin. What month is it? It's June. Get out of here. Get out right out

01:31.120 --> 01:35.040
of this town that we people who say they should have the pumpkin spice latte every year.

01:35.040 --> 01:39.120
Why don't you start your day off with some birthday cake asshole birthday cake?

01:40.640 --> 01:44.800
How about it? How about a Thanksgiving, a plump Thanksgiving turkey on your birthday,

01:44.800 --> 01:48.800
which isn't on which is not on Thanksgiving nor a birthday turkey?

01:48.800 --> 01:53.920
Asshole. I cannot have the pumpkin spice latte anymore. I'm trying to watch my carbs. Oh,

01:53.920 --> 01:58.480
Justin. I know. I don't want to think about my tree. No, it doesn't have carbs. If it's delicious,

01:58.480 --> 02:04.160
I have a terminal disease. I might treat myself to one. I'm really more of an eggnog latte man

02:04.160 --> 02:09.920
myself. Hey, listen, I didn't come here for your judgment. I came to give it. It's not winter yet.

02:09.920 --> 02:15.360
You keep your eggnog latte to yourself where it belongs. I'll keep my eggnog latte in my tummy.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.200
Do you know what? I'm a little disappointed. I'm a little disappointed in the fact that the

02:19.920 --> 02:29.120
PSL lacks any rejuvenative properties. I spent all day yesterday just drinking whiskey and eating

02:29.120 --> 02:37.440
Tex-Mex basically from sunup to sundown. Alone in your apartment. Just alone. And I was really

02:37.440 --> 02:44.160
hoping that a morning time PSL would bring me out of my stupor, but it has actually redoubled.

02:44.160 --> 02:49.920
My sorrows. I am actually on a pumpkin spice latte with like some ginkgo and like some beta

02:49.920 --> 02:57.440
carotene and some David Carradine. No, I just want to say and then not. Hey, Tommy, not doing so good.

02:57.440 --> 03:02.800
How about some cream? How about some sweet pumpkin cream? Yeah, I just I want to be able to drink it

03:02.800 --> 03:10.080
and then not ship my guts out later. That ship has sailed. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.160
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby-est brother, Griffin McElroy.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.400
I'm really, guys, burning the candle, burning the candle at both ends over here. I'm holding it

03:18.400 --> 03:24.640
together with scotch tape and floss. This is, of course, an advice show for the modern era. We take

03:24.640 --> 03:30.000
your questions and unsolicited questions from the Yahoo answer service and turn them into wisdom,

03:30.000 --> 03:37.600
like alchemy or like pumpkin spice lattes. Boy, one of those would go down good. I wish I wasn't

03:37.600 --> 03:43.680
so fat. Here's your first question. I'm a lady who has got her sexy right. No pumpkin spice latte

03:43.680 --> 03:50.240
is there. However, I feel weird approaching guys I'm interested in, afraid I'll appear too forward

03:50.240 --> 03:55.760
and scare them off. My friend, a male, says that this is not the case, that men would love to get

03:55.760 --> 04:03.200
proposition. Bad word choice. Bad word choice. I feel this is a myth and that most guys would get

04:03.200 --> 04:10.000
and that most guys would get freaked out. Is my friend right or crazy? Mystified in Michigan.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
You make me so... First of all, propositioning someone is what a prostitute does. Yeah. Hey,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.440
sailor. Hey, sailor. Did you see what I'm working with? Coming to this port often? Hey, uh, hey,

04:19.440 --> 04:25.120
ladies and gentlemen, if you're wondering why there is a battle of the sexes, why the sexes

04:25.120 --> 04:29.680
can't seem to agree on anything, this is how fundamentally they misunderstand each other.

04:29.680 --> 04:36.560
Make me so angry. A base level, like this is what we're building from. Do you know what I think it

04:36.560 --> 04:42.400
is? I think it's that everyone speaks in generalities. Like the guy said, all guys would

04:42.400 --> 04:47.360
love this. And the girl said, all guys would be afraid of this. I think that there are definitely

04:47.360 --> 04:52.480
guys that would be very intimidated by a girl walking up to them and hitting on them. I also

04:52.480 --> 04:56.000
think that there will be guys that will be flattered and totally into it. And then I think

04:56.000 --> 05:00.400
there'll be guys who wouldn't fucking care. The guys, but Travis, like the guys who would be

05:00.400 --> 05:07.040
intimidated by it are also have like a genetic predisposition to propagate the species. Yeah.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.800
And like, they're not going to like, huh, shriveling, shrinking violet. They're going to be...

05:13.440 --> 05:16.640
If you're walking up to them and like grabbing them by the nuts and just saying like,

05:16.640 --> 05:23.520
give me these. Yeah. This is my seed. Yeah. I've never, I don't think any dude has ever looked

05:23.520 --> 05:27.040
across the bar at a pretty girl and said, man, I hope she doesn't come talk to me.

05:27.600 --> 05:32.800
It's always, I hope she stays at least 20 feet away. Yeah. It's always, how can I trap her?

05:32.800 --> 05:37.920
I need to make a, like a nest of leaves and sticks with a big pit underneath. You need to

05:37.920 --> 05:46.560
make a bamboo tiger pit and catch that broad. Like, yeah. Like eat. I don't know the mind of

05:46.560 --> 05:53.360
the woman as my wife is keen to remind me, but I do know that in a man's mind, if an attractive lady

05:53.360 --> 05:59.200
were to come up and talk to you, you may have to turn her down because you're otherwise occupied.

06:00.080 --> 06:05.520
I mean, like with another, with another lady first. I'm playing snake on my phone. I'm sorry.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.160
You can wait. You should see how long this snake is. I've got to quickens right now.

06:11.040 --> 06:16.560
I just want to check. Doing some quickening. I have to quickens. Yeah. Like you have to turn

06:16.560 --> 06:23.120
down, but nobody's going to be like, leave. Yeah. I think also, I think that there's a certain amount

06:23.120 --> 06:29.120
of when a girl has approached a guy in the past and the guy has like not been interested, what

06:29.120 --> 06:35.920
she's told herself is that that guy was intimidated by her. And that's how that rumor got starting.

06:35.920 --> 06:40.160
I think that it is just as likely that the guy just wasn't feeling her vibe.

06:40.800 --> 06:46.320
See, that's such a shame because I think it, I don't claim, I also don't claim to know the mind

06:46.320 --> 06:52.560
of a woman, but I think that if you're a super attractive lady and you go up to a dude who is

06:52.560 --> 06:57.200
clearly less attractive than you are at a bar and you proposition him and he turns you down,

06:57.200 --> 07:02.800
you never recover from that. You, you, you ain't never coming back from that. I'm sorry. Like,

07:02.800 --> 07:09.120
can we take a step back here? Why is prop, why is like every romantic encounter that this girl has

07:09.120 --> 07:14.960
like Robert Redford in Indecent Proposal? Why there be a proposition like, excuse me.

07:15.680 --> 07:22.320
There is $10,000 in my hotel room upstairs. You have to find it. Associate Reginald has

07:22.320 --> 07:28.080
a briefcase with $100,000. I am propositioning you.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.920
What accent is that?

07:29.920 --> 07:33.200
What? Half comic, the guy half, uh, Hitchcock.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.240
Okay.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.800
It was really, really scary.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.200
Maybe that's why the guy is intimidated.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.200
Hello.

07:43.200 --> 07:50.880
Unmarked, much like myself. No needle of tattoo has touched my skin. I am ready

07:50.880 --> 07:53.600
to make love to you. Ah, Jesus.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.040
I am so upset.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.600
Reginald, open the briefcase.

08:01.040 --> 08:05.840
You will see the bills are in Ugandan currency. They are untraceable.

08:06.560 --> 08:10.640
Oh, $100,000 in gold Cougarands.

08:10.640 --> 08:19.040
This is gold bullion. My associate Reginald will take this gold bullion to a deposit box

08:19.040 --> 08:26.800
of your celebrity. At that point, a brief fleeting lovemaking will commence.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.320
Oh, Jesus. Now I'm just thinking about-

08:28.320 --> 08:29.360
Where are you going?

08:29.920 --> 08:32.640
I'm thinking about being at a bar and then like-

08:32.640 --> 08:33.840
Excuse me.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.520
The Lord of House Harkonnen from Dune, like floating over.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.680
Good evening. The spice is life.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.360
I have a briefcase of spice.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.640
Oh, Jesus.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.160
Derek, actually, at the end there, there was some Borat thrown in.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.880
People seem to like that.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.240
That crazy Borat cat.

08:56.240 --> 09:00.400
Yeah, like don't proposition. Maybe just strike up a conversation, see if you have some chemistry.

09:01.920 --> 09:02.960
Try that out, maybe.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.080
Hey, I'm getting married to the love of my life next year.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.000
Thing is, I'm a freelance writer who doesn't make a lot of money,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.480
so all the cash we're saving now is going towards making the wedding awesome.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.600
Making sure we don't have to live out of a dumpstrap afterwards.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.440
Because of this, our budget for our honeymoon is pretty low.

09:24.080 --> 09:29.680
Where are some good places my future wife and I can go and enjoy our new married life

09:29.680 --> 09:31.200
without spending a lot of dough?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.600
We live in the Dallas, Texas area, if that helps.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.160
Britain in Burrokesville.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.560
I actually have a pretty good suggestion for the-

09:40.560 --> 09:43.840
A couple of my friends got married a year or two ago,

09:43.840 --> 09:50.160
and before they went on their real honeymoon because they were very busy with work and

09:50.160 --> 09:54.080
everything, they did this thing that I really liked and they stayed in Cincinnati,

09:54.640 --> 09:59.040
but in a hotel and acted as though they were tourists in their hometown.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.600
So they went and did stuff that they never do.

10:01.600 --> 10:08.080
They went to restaurants and to like theaters that they never go to and like stayed in a hotel.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.440
So they did a honeymoon, but in the town that they lived in.

10:11.440 --> 10:17.200
They didn't have to travel, no like expenses to like get overseas or anything like that.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.320
So you might try that out.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.520
A stunning moon?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.120
Is that the-

10:21.120 --> 10:22.720
Okay, yeah.

10:22.720 --> 10:23.760
A stunning moon, maybe.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.320
Okay, yes.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.080
Maybe you guys just don't even get a hotel.

10:28.080 --> 10:33.520
Maybe you just like sleep in a different room in your own house and just like take care-

10:33.520 --> 10:34.640
She like set up a tent.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.040
Just like take care of each other.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.100
Oh.

10:39.120 --> 10:39.760
Oh, you mean-

10:40.400 --> 10:41.200
Oh, yeah.

10:41.200 --> 10:41.920
Oh, boy.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.400
Oh.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.040
Oh, golly.

10:43.040 --> 10:43.840
Oh, yikes.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.080
What my wife and I did is we actually-

10:48.080 --> 10:50.000
We had already been living together when we got married.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.920
So we had most of our like household appliance type things.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.640
What we did was we had people-

10:57.280 --> 10:58.640
We used this site called-

10:58.640 --> 11:05.120
I think it's thebigday.com maybe, but it lets people give you money for a trip,

11:05.120 --> 11:07.520
but they're buying you things for your wedding.

11:07.520 --> 11:13.040
So like we had a $50 denomination and that was dinner at a restaurant.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.640
Now, correct me if I'm wrong.

11:14.640 --> 11:19.120
Didn't you also put on there at one point dancing lessons with Antonio Banderas?

11:19.120 --> 11:20.720
That was one of the options.

11:21.520 --> 11:26.720
And I actually had someone come to me afterwards and say,

11:27.520 --> 11:29.200
so how are those dancing lessons?

11:30.160 --> 11:34.800
And I had to break the news to them that I'm sorry, I did not actually have that.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.960
You just gave me some money that I probably spent on-

11:36.960 --> 11:39.360
Because Antonio Banderas isn't real.

11:40.720 --> 11:41.440
He's not real.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.160
He's not real.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.840
He's a computer generated meme.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.720
It's got spread around the web.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.320
So I joked the one a little too far.

11:48.320 --> 11:53.680
He went viral and he went Zorro and then he went Zeta, Zeta Jones.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.400
What a talent she is.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.320
Also computer generated.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.360
I don't want to pat it on the back too much,

12:01.360 --> 12:05.360
but we had like two or three legitimate answers to this question.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.200
I feel pretty good about it.

12:07.200 --> 12:07.440
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.440
Let me take your temperature, Griffin.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.320
How do you feel?

12:10.320 --> 12:10.800
I don't know.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.960
I feel like there's some stuff.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.720
I feel like the Texas aspect.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.080
I feel like we could explore that.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.320
Well, maybe you could address, of the three of us,

12:18.320 --> 12:20.720
I think the best one to address that would be Travis.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.040
Yeah.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.200
Travis, what's going on in Texas these days?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.080
I'm glad you asked.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.520
From what I understand, there's just oil being struck everywhere.

12:29.520 --> 12:29.840
Okay.

12:29.840 --> 12:34.640
And so maybe you could have like an oil-themed honeymoon.

12:34.640 --> 12:40.080
So you're saying that to celebrate their newfound eternal love,

12:41.120 --> 12:44.960
they indulge in some tycoon-ship?

12:46.160 --> 12:46.720
Yeah.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.360
Big hats, big buckles, a bolo tie.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.800
Big shiny white teeth.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.800
Yeah, yeah.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.720
And like a walrus style mustache.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.640
Don't make your wife grow a mustache.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.440
Yeah, don't make your wife grow a mustache.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.480
Let me ask you this, Justin.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.080
As the only one of the three of us that is married, as far as I know,

13:07.360 --> 13:10.560
what, in your opinion, is the actual point of the honeymoon?

13:10.560 --> 13:13.280
Is it just like a celebration of, hey, we're married now?

13:13.920 --> 13:15.920
Let's have two weeks of awesome party?

13:15.920 --> 13:16.880
I'm glad you asked, Travis.

13:17.680 --> 13:22.400
The point of the honeymoon used to be that you could finally do it.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.200
Yeah.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.120
So you'd want to do it all the time.

13:25.120 --> 13:29.840
Maybe you remember that hit episode of Wings when Joe and Helen got married.

13:30.880 --> 13:35.600
I guess they had never done it before because they really hung out in their hotel room.

13:35.600 --> 13:41.520
He must be a stronger man than I, because how can you resist Helen?

13:42.080 --> 13:43.360
Yeah, that's a good question.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.000
She starts playing that cello and it's like, don't mind if I do.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.680
Don't mind if I do forever.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.240
These days, people tend to live together.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.400
They tend to have a little bit of that stuff beforehand.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.560
So I don't think that it serves the same traditional role.

13:58.560 --> 14:03.760
I think for my wife and I, we went out of the country.

14:03.760 --> 14:11.280
It was a really nice opportunity to sort of get used to the idea of being married

14:11.280 --> 14:16.320
and kind of get away from everybody and have our first week and a half

14:17.360 --> 14:20.480
as a married couple, sort of figuring that out ourselves.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.560
So it's like marriage spring training.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.920
It's marriage bootcamp.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.640
Exactly right.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.140
Okay.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.200
And you just explore each other's bodies.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.640
So I guess what you're saying is real advice here.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.520
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do as long as you're together.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.600
Just explore each other's bodies.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.600
Just every nook and cranny.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.840
Honeymoon in each other's bodies.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.760
Every crag, every cranny.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.720
All right.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.400
Set up a hotel room in each other's bodies and just stay there for a while.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.520
It's really good to know it.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.720
More than 10 milliliters of pumpkin spice latte.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.760
I need you to explore it.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.680
Yeah, just kind of whatever you do,

14:57.680 --> 15:00.800
make sure that you cut yourselves off from everybody for a little while.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.560
Just really treat yourself.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.400
Six or seven months tops.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.880
You don't feel like that sets up the bar a little high though.

15:06.880 --> 15:11.520
Like I feel like I feel like fresh off the wedding block.

15:12.080 --> 15:16.960
I feel that you should maybe have like a shitty honeymoon

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
and then have it get better from there.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.600
Do you know what I mean?

15:19.600 --> 15:22.400
Like you came back from Europe.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.600
You were probably expecting every day to be a sweet Irish adventure,

15:25.600 --> 15:26.640
but it wasn't, was it?

15:26.640 --> 15:27.600
That's true.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.600
It wasn't a sweet Irish adventure every day.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.400
Marriage isn't a sweet Irish adventure every day.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.200
You got to come to grips with that fact.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.880
I feel like maybe for your honeymoon,

15:37.680 --> 15:43.920
you should just have this really acrimonious sort of rapport with your new wife.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.600
I think maybe you should go do something unpleasant like help a friend move.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.880
Like maybe that's your honeymoon.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.080
And then it only gets better from there.

15:52.080 --> 15:52.640
That's true.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.200
Help your friend move whether they were planning to or not.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.400
Secretly help your friend move and then face the

15:58.400 --> 16:00.320
breaking and nearing charges together as a couple.

16:00.320 --> 16:00.820
Yeah.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.320
You know what?

16:02.320 --> 16:04.800
You know where no one ever goes on their honeymoon?

16:04.800 --> 16:05.520
Prison.

16:05.520 --> 16:05.760
Yeah.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.840
I beg to-

16:07.840 --> 16:09.600
I am adjacent to Logan County.

16:09.600 --> 16:14.320
I'm pretty sure some people have gone to prison for their honeymoon, sir.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.080
How about a Yahoo?

16:16.080 --> 16:16.400
Yes.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.680
Okay.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.360
Um, this one was sent in by FaceStyle.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.400
Thank you, FaceStyle.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, NerdyGameGirlDoll.

16:27.520 --> 16:27.840
Okay.

16:28.800 --> 16:29.680
Who asks?

16:29.680 --> 16:30.560
She's trying her best.

16:32.240 --> 16:36.960
Is it a little extraordinary that I accidentally speak in an English accent?

16:40.560 --> 16:43.520
Every once in a while, I slip into an English accent,

16:43.520 --> 16:46.160
even though I was born and raised in Colorado.

16:46.160 --> 16:52.000
I can't count to ten with no waiting times without doing it.

16:52.800 --> 16:58.240
I've never known anyone from out of the country except for Russians and Canadians,

16:58.240 --> 17:02.560
and I don't notice when it happens until my friends start to talk in their English accents,

17:02.560 --> 17:05.680
which frankly are horrid sounding most of the time,

17:05.680 --> 17:08.080
and then I'm not too sure what to do.

17:08.080 --> 17:11.680
So, could anyone tell me if it's a little extraordinary or odd?

17:11.680 --> 17:13.200
Does anyone else do this?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.280
Does anyone have any idea why I might do this?

17:15.280 --> 17:16.080
Thanks for your help.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.520
I have an idea.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.640
I am trapped in a douche ice age.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.000
You have...

17:23.440 --> 17:25.280
You have douche blood in your veins.

17:26.080 --> 17:26.320
Yeah.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.640
Is your grandmother half douche?

17:29.600 --> 17:31.440
Because that would make you, I think, a quarter douche, right?

17:31.440 --> 17:36.400
I am 1 16th douche, and that's why I speak with an English accent sometimes.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.000
You know that sometimes they say when they're telling you about,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.040
you know, talking to you about writing literature,

17:43.040 --> 17:47.120
that you should use efficient language that communicates the most amount about a person,

17:47.680 --> 17:51.520
you know, without saying, showing rather than telling.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.400
Feeling, doing.

17:52.400 --> 17:56.720
That first sentence of this question tells you everything

17:56.720 --> 17:58.480
you could ever need to know about this person.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.680
That seems like the type of name badge they should wear

18:01.680 --> 18:03.040
if you were meeting them for the first time.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.400
You just look down and be like, oh, okay,

18:04.400 --> 18:07.360
and then walk away from them and never acknowledge their existence again.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.400
Does this make me special?

18:10.400 --> 18:14.160
Am I a special snowflake because, oh, blimey, gov.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.160
Oh, god.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.520
I guess it makes you special in the way that I hate you more than anyone else.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.320
Oh, my god.

18:22.320 --> 18:26.400
Can you imagine trying to talk to this person in real life?

18:26.400 --> 18:31.280
They're like, yeah, I think we should go to Hot Topic and then, oh, gov, that's it, no.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.280
Why does this keep happening to me?

18:33.280 --> 18:34.320
Apples and pears.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.280
Every time I try to have a conversation with you,

18:39.280 --> 18:41.360
with you, it comes out.

18:42.160 --> 18:42.880
I don't know what-

18:42.880 --> 18:47.120
If you know this person, if you in your life are acquainted with this person,

18:47.120 --> 18:52.240
do me a favor and start to slowly convince them that not only is it not normal,

18:52.240 --> 18:55.040
that it is cause for concern when that happens.

18:55.040 --> 18:55.280
Yeah.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.080
It's like a really shitty version of the movie phenomenon.

18:58.080 --> 19:04.000
Yeah, convince them that they need to go talk to somebody professional about this

19:04.000 --> 19:05.920
and start to get really worried about them

19:05.920 --> 19:08.000
and maybe cease to hang out with them for a while.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.360
I have a confession to make, Daniel.

19:11.360 --> 19:15.760
You and I have been in a relationship for three years now.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.640
I have a condition.

19:17.600 --> 19:21.440
I haven't had an episode in over 12 months,

19:21.440 --> 19:25.920
but I do have a condition where I occasionally speak in an English accent.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.040
Is that extraordinary?

19:29.680 --> 19:31.120
I'm taking medication.

19:31.120 --> 19:39.760
I've been on a pretty intense therapy regimen for a while now, but it could strike at any time.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.480
Is this extraordinary?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.560
Do you know what medication this person should go on?

19:43.280 --> 19:43.760
What?

19:43.760 --> 19:44.320
Poison.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.720
Nah, she's trying her best.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.160
It's just like-

19:50.160 --> 19:51.680
She'll look back at this and laugh when-

19:51.680 --> 19:52.640
It's bad enough.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.240
What's worse?

19:54.240 --> 19:59.680
This person who is probably a 12 year old who is trying to find her place in the world-

19:59.680 --> 20:00.880
I was going to say 12.

20:00.880 --> 20:10.880
Or the person who goes to London with their rich parents on a summer break

20:10.880 --> 20:15.760
and then comes back and then exclusively talks with a British accent, which is worse.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.040
Which one's worse?

20:17.040 --> 20:17.280
Yeah.

20:18.080 --> 20:18.880
Oh, God.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.960
It's like so tiny a difference.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.080
Both are so terrible.

20:24.720 --> 20:29.280
I think that this person is worse because they're asking if it's extraordinary.

20:29.280 --> 20:29.520
Yeah.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.800
Okay, there it is.

20:30.800 --> 20:35.440
They recognize they're doing it and they're still doing it.

20:35.440 --> 20:40.240
But they recognize that they're doing it, but they claim to have no control over it.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.520
I just slip into it.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.400
What's going on?

20:42.400 --> 20:43.360
Am I possessed?

20:44.000 --> 20:48.080
Can we do the rest of this episode of our comp pod?

20:48.960 --> 20:53.200
Can we do it with accents and then this will be the accent episode?

20:55.040 --> 20:55.440
Would that be extraordinary?

20:55.440 --> 20:56.720
We're a little too deep already.

20:56.720 --> 21:02.880
Well, I can only do French-Canadian trapper, like a French-Canadian,

21:02.880 --> 21:07.840
and I can only say the sentence, I am a French-Canadian trapper,

21:07.840 --> 21:09.920
and that's the only thing I can say.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.480
Well, that'll be the only thing you say for the rest of the podcast.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.320
Justin broke out his Baron Harkonnen-

21:14.320 --> 21:16.080
Can it be the last thing he says?

21:16.080 --> 21:16.320
Yes.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.920
That would be ideal.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.000
Justin can bust out his Baron Harkonnen.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.640
I will do that drunk beetle accent that I was doing a few minutes ago,

21:24.640 --> 21:25.840
and then Travis just says that one.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.800
That was a good one.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.360
Yeah.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.200
Travis just says that one thing over and over again.

21:29.840 --> 21:35.200
So before we take a trip, I would like to throw out-

21:35.840 --> 21:42.080
Justin made the mistake of giving me time between the time when we were going to record the episode

21:42.080 --> 21:45.360
and the time when we actually did, so I played a game with our listeners

21:45.360 --> 21:48.720
and asked them for words that they would like to hear on the show.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.120
You made a mad list.

21:49.120 --> 21:54.000
And I arranged those words into a short story that I would like Griffin to read now.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.080
Okay, so what I'm looking at is a mad lib that-

22:00.560 --> 22:01.280
It's a mad lib.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.960
Like, let's not split hairs.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.400
Yes.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.560
Sometimes we make bits on the show because I think they'll be funny,

22:08.560 --> 22:11.760
and then sometimes we make bits on the show to antagonize each other.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.560
For instance, monthly observances, I hate that bit.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.080
I think Travis kind of does too.

22:18.080 --> 22:21.920
Griffin inflicts it on us every fucking month.

22:21.920 --> 22:26.880
This was actually Justin's punishment for not being ready to record the call when he was supposed to.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.040
So now he has to hear this mad lib.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.560
I had something really important come up.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.880
What was it?

22:32.880 --> 22:33.760
It was a cliffhanger.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.000
What? Excuse me?

22:36.000 --> 22:36.880
It was a cliffhanger.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.480
Could just not watch the second half.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.600
Of what show, Justin?

22:42.400 --> 22:42.900
Forget.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.840
Was it Toddlers and Tiaras?

22:45.840 --> 22:46.340
Yeah.

22:46.340 --> 22:54.180
Inwood lost her foot in a logging accident and she didn't actually be able to perform.

22:56.580 --> 23:01.700
This is the epic and moist fable of Bumsie Clumhole and the marshmallow debacle.

23:01.700 --> 23:02.820
Why am I doing this?

23:05.220 --> 23:06.100
Read away.

23:06.100 --> 23:06.580
Don't stop now.

23:06.580 --> 23:10.580
Travis, this is making me hate you and our listeners who sent this shit in.

23:10.580 --> 23:11.540
I knew it.

23:11.540 --> 23:16.260
One fine and scrumptious day Bumsie was hanging out with his funkalicious friend Batman.

23:16.260 --> 23:18.180
They were runny late for the big race.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.980
The thick freakness.

23:24.020 --> 23:28.740
They've been watching the clock when suddenly everything got all timey wimey wibbly wobbly.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.940
There's a Doctor Who thing.

23:31.300 --> 23:36.100
So they leapt onto their Pegasus, Celestia Sprinkles, and sprang into action,

23:36.100 --> 23:38.100
only stopping to get a fish taco on the way.

23:38.820 --> 23:40.100
Slow down, yelled Batman.

23:40.100 --> 23:43.780
This is chafing my turgid front butt and giving me lavish thoughts.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.260
Oh hogwash, yelled Bumsie.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.220
Stop being persnickety.

23:47.220 --> 23:48.020
This is funkalicious.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.020
Incredible, sighed Batman.

23:50.420 --> 23:52.740
But sadly the whole thing was a boondoggle.

23:52.740 --> 23:57.540
Bumsie died and Batman was left as the only living boy in New York.

23:58.260 --> 24:00.820
That was the end of it and we will never do that to you again.

24:00.820 --> 24:01.860
And I promise you that.

24:03.540 --> 24:07.460
I wrote a book in second grade called Grant Andrews Kid Cop

24:07.460 --> 24:11.060
that reads better than that thing that you made.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.180
Why did you do that to him?

24:14.980 --> 24:18.740
Why is it that you were trying to punish me, but Griffin ends up catching the brunt of it?

24:18.740 --> 24:19.700
Because it was humiliating.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.540
I said words in there that I would never say.

24:21.540 --> 24:22.500
Funkalicious?

24:23.300 --> 24:27.300
You realize that every word I say is like a precious treasure, right?

24:27.300 --> 24:31.140
And you just tarnished my streak.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.260
Precious treasures.

24:33.460 --> 24:37.060
There's only one way I can watch this day, so I'm going to have to do it.

24:37.060 --> 24:41.060
I'm 30 though.

24:41.060 --> 24:43.060
I think old people jokes are funny.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.380
Let's go to the money zone.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.740
Let's go to the suicide zone.

24:48.260 --> 24:49.460
And then the money zone.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.300
Hey, Katie.

25:02.180 --> 25:03.860
Happy birthday, lady.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.220
Thank you for being you.

25:05.220 --> 25:06.580
Thank you.

25:06.580 --> 25:10.260
Your boyfriend, Charlie, you introduced to a lot of great stuff like My Brother, My Brother,

25:10.260 --> 25:12.740
Me and The Vice Shelf of the Modern Era and Katamari Damacy.

25:13.460 --> 25:17.220
And now he's returning the favor by saying, hey, happy birthday.

25:17.220 --> 25:21.380
You know, there's so much of a connection between those two things, don't you guys think?

25:21.380 --> 25:23.780
Between My Brother, My Brother, Me and Katamari Damacy?

25:23.780 --> 25:29.220
Yeah, because in Katamari Damacy, you roll a ball and you pick up things to make the ball bigger.

25:29.220 --> 25:33.380
And in My Brother, My Brother, Me, you roll your ears

25:33.380 --> 25:36.420
through our words and it makes your heart bigger.

25:36.420 --> 25:38.420
Wow, you're right, that's haunting.

25:38.900 --> 25:44.260
Until your heart gets too big for your chest and then you die from it, it explodes.

25:44.260 --> 25:45.700
Like Seabiscuit.

25:45.700 --> 25:47.940
That's my favorite trap from the Saw movies.

25:49.940 --> 25:57.060
Hey, Charlene, your boyfriend, Adam, Gaber, is having his birthday today and you...

25:58.500 --> 26:00.740
You fucked up twice really bad so far.

26:00.740 --> 26:01.300
Let me try this.

26:01.300 --> 26:02.660
Let's take it apart.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.380
Let's take it apart.

26:03.380 --> 26:08.180
The first goof was that you called her Charlene and not Charlene.

26:08.180 --> 26:09.460
Okay, that was my bad.

26:09.460 --> 26:11.460
You know who my favorite Hollywood actress is?

26:11.460 --> 26:12.740
Charlise Theron.

26:12.740 --> 26:17.460
Hey, Adam, happy birthday and anniversary from Charlene.

26:18.420 --> 26:19.380
Both are within about...

26:19.380 --> 26:21.220
It's a soft, it's a soft shuh.

26:21.220 --> 26:23.780
Sha- Charlene.

26:23.780 --> 26:27.140
I mean, I'll tell you the other problem is that you were stuttering earlier

26:27.140 --> 26:30.260
and you said Adam is Gaber and that sounds like...

26:30.260 --> 26:32.740
No, Adam is Beaver.

26:32.740 --> 26:33.780
Adam is Beaver.

26:33.780 --> 26:36.740
Adam, Gaber, it's their anniversary and his birthday.

26:36.740 --> 26:38.180
They're within about three days of each other.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.220
He likes many things, but loves bumblebees.

26:41.780 --> 26:44.580
I'm going to call Charlene out on something here.

26:44.580 --> 26:47.140
What do you mean it's about three days apart?

26:47.140 --> 26:48.180
Like it fluctuates?

26:48.740 --> 26:50.020
Well, his birthday...

26:50.020 --> 26:50.420
Yeah, right.

26:50.420 --> 26:52.260
Shouldn't it be exactly three days apart?

26:52.980 --> 26:54.020
Why are you acting like this?

26:54.740 --> 26:59.700
You know that every day is like incrementally, like microscopically longer than the last day.

26:59.700 --> 27:00.420
You know that, right?

27:00.420 --> 27:01.780
Like days are getting longer.

27:01.780 --> 27:02.180
Yeah.

27:02.180 --> 27:04.260
She's actually far more accurate than you are.

27:04.900 --> 27:05.540
Oh.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.020
Because they started dating at some point during the day

27:08.660 --> 27:11.540
and he was born at some point during the night.

27:11.540 --> 27:13.620
Oh, so she's got it like down to the second.

27:13.620 --> 27:14.660
She knows exactly the second.

27:14.660 --> 27:16.020
She just didn't want to bore you with the details.

27:16.020 --> 27:19.460
But hey, happy birthday and anniversary.

27:19.460 --> 27:21.940
If you'd like me to mispronounce your name,

27:21.940 --> 27:25.140
you can go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron

27:25.140 --> 27:26.820
and get a message up there.

27:26.820 --> 27:32.180
But thank you to all of you and happy birthday or anniversary as the case may be.

27:32.180 --> 27:35.460
I'd like to come off it with a Yahoo answer if we can.

27:35.460 --> 27:36.660
Okay, gladly.

27:36.660 --> 27:38.180
This one, this one's actually old.

27:38.180 --> 27:39.540
I've been holding on to this one.

27:39.540 --> 27:42.820
I've had this arrow in my quiver for a long time in the cinema by Jacob Locker.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.180
Thank you, Jacob.

27:44.180 --> 27:46.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user James who asks,

27:47.460 --> 27:51.060
how can I make myself into a human peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

27:51.060 --> 27:55.060
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

27:55.060 --> 27:56.420
I like making messes.

28:00.420 --> 28:02.420
And I want to really do this.

28:02.420 --> 28:08.100
The first thing I want to do is get covered in a peanut butter type of mixture

28:08.100 --> 28:15.460
and then a jelly type of mixture and have like some giant bread made of smaller bread.

28:15.460 --> 28:19.460
And also when I get the peanut butter mixture and just a jelly,

28:19.460 --> 28:25.060
mixture poured on me, she, I lay on the bread and get it dumped on me.

28:25.060 --> 28:27.700
Or just stand up and have it poured on me.

28:27.700 --> 28:28.420
It's your vote.

28:28.420 --> 28:32.740
And last but not least, how could I make like a maybe runny,

28:32.740 --> 28:36.180
liquidy peanut butter mix and running liquid jelly mix?

28:36.980 --> 28:40.740
That guys, that, that was all one, one sentence.

28:40.740 --> 28:41.780
Oh no.

28:42.340 --> 28:46.980
Tell me what you guys think and how could I, how I could make a mess with this stuff.

28:46.980 --> 28:50.900
And I forgot to say that at the end, after I get the mixtures poured on me,

28:50.900 --> 28:55.540
I'm going to get two giant pieces of bread, cover it with regular PB and J,

28:55.540 --> 29:00.820
cover myself up and maybe roll around in it, unleash the ideas and the creativeness.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.780
This will be so much fun and feel awesome.

29:04.580 --> 29:07.060
I'm right in thinking that there's an underlying and all the

29:07.060 --> 29:08.740
while I'm going to be jerking it so right.

29:08.740 --> 29:12.900
I'm going to jerk it in this runny liquidy jelly type mixture.

29:12.900 --> 29:16.180
Oh, and BT dubs, I'm just going to be jerking it.

29:16.180 --> 29:19.220
Danny is just one flag away from that trip to Universal Studios.

29:19.220 --> 29:22.420
He's made through the gap fountain, made it through the car wash.

29:22.420 --> 29:26.100
Now he's just got to get this one last flag from a giant peanut butter jelly suit.

29:26.100 --> 29:29.380
And oh my God, is he masturbating?

29:29.380 --> 29:33.780
He's so excited about that Casio keyboard.

29:33.780 --> 29:37.700
That Casio keyboard that he has flowed on the flag.

29:37.700 --> 29:40.260
He is using the flag as some sort of,

29:40.260 --> 29:43.860
he is using the flag as some sort of jerk it sheath.

29:47.060 --> 29:51.700
I'm Mark Summers and I quit television forever because I am yucked.

29:51.700 --> 29:52.660
I am retired.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.460
I have now have obsessive compulsive disorder.

29:55.460 --> 30:01.620
I know because of this child's lewd act, I am leaving the entertainment business.

30:01.620 --> 30:04.500
And that completes our Mark Summers origin story.

30:04.500 --> 30:10.580
Those flags, those flags are for, those are roller skate vouchers, not jerk it sheaths.

30:11.380 --> 30:13.940
Sir, sir, sir.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.060
Pardon.

30:15.060 --> 30:15.700
Good day.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.020
You win nothing.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.060
Hey Mark, you want to watch?

30:21.860 --> 30:23.780
Hey Mark, I double dare you.

30:26.420 --> 30:28.100
I'm going to ask a question.

30:28.100 --> 30:29.620
Mark you up for a physical challenge?

30:30.660 --> 30:31.700
Come over here and watch.

30:31.700 --> 30:36.740
I, I might be hoping for too much here when I ask this question.

30:37.860 --> 30:38.820
To what purpose?

30:40.820 --> 30:42.340
He likes to make messes.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.300
But like that's it?

30:43.300 --> 30:45.380
Like he's going to do this in the privacy of his own home?

30:45.380 --> 30:47.060
He likes to get super sloppy.

30:47.060 --> 30:50.740
Like he's just going to be in his parents basement making himself a giant PB&J?

30:52.020 --> 30:53.460
I think it's going to take him a while.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.420
I think it's going to take him a long time, but not too long,

30:56.420 --> 30:59.300
because if he wants to make a giant bread out of tiny breads,

30:59.300 --> 31:02.820
those are going to get kind of, kind of moldy after.

31:02.820 --> 31:05.780
Oh, so you're afraid of this getting gross in some way?

31:07.140 --> 31:09.780
Right, I'm saying that he's got a really small window.

31:09.780 --> 31:14.660
If he wants to do this tastefully, he's got to be quick about it.

31:14.660 --> 31:17.460
If he does this at home by himself, it's disgusting.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.780
If he does it in front of a crowd, it's modern art.

31:19.780 --> 31:21.380
Yeah, well, that's the idea, right?

31:21.380 --> 31:24.260
He wants to unleash the ideas and creativeness.

31:24.260 --> 31:28.340
And as a side effect, it's going to be so much fun and it's going to feel awesome.

31:28.340 --> 31:29.700
And like, I don't deny that.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.740
Can you guys imagine how good that would feel?

31:32.740 --> 31:35.940
Well, as long as he doesn't use Chunky, because that shit gets everywhere.

31:35.940 --> 31:37.860
Yeah, that would be kind of abrasive on your skin.

31:37.860 --> 31:39.620
You would have to go Jif Smooth.

31:39.620 --> 31:41.620
Yeah, totally.

31:41.620 --> 31:44.660
Cheesy moms choose Jif for their man-sized PB&Js.

31:45.940 --> 31:50.420
Can I change my either legal name or karaoke name to Jif Smooth?

31:53.060 --> 31:54.420
I think you can go Jif Smooth.

31:54.420 --> 31:59.220
Who borrowed your car?

31:59.220 --> 32:02.260
I loaned it to Jif Smooth as a misstep.

32:02.260 --> 32:03.220
Yeah, I shouldn't have known.

32:03.220 --> 32:05.460
Yeah, because he likes to make messes.

32:05.460 --> 32:07.300
It's a messy, messy boy, Jif Smooth.

32:08.580 --> 32:11.620
He says like a jelly type mixture.

32:11.620 --> 32:12.900
Does he mean jelly?

32:13.940 --> 32:16.100
I believe jelly is a jelly type mixture.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.340
It has to be some sort of gelatinous,

32:18.340 --> 32:22.980
plasmatic substance, something that oscillates between liquid and solid.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.420
Oh, like lava?

32:24.420 --> 32:26.580
Like lava, yeah, which would be great.

32:27.620 --> 32:28.740
Hey, why don't we do this?

32:28.740 --> 32:32.660
I'll wrap you up in a blanket or an afghan, and I'll say you're a burrito,

32:32.660 --> 32:36.740
and I'll throw you in a volcano so that we never have to think about you again.

32:36.740 --> 32:37.860
That sounds great.

32:38.900 --> 32:41.300
That sounds like a real tasty mix.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.180
Will this guy eat it later?

32:44.180 --> 32:45.780
Yeah, that's what I don't understand.

32:45.780 --> 32:48.660
Is he doing this, and then he's gonna be like, now somebody eat me.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.140
Or is he just doing it, and then he's gonna be done,

32:51.140 --> 32:53.620
and then he's gonna shower, and then go to work at the bar?

32:53.620 --> 32:54.580
I don't think he's gonna shower.

32:54.580 --> 32:59.780
I think he's gonna go to work still covered in, you know, placenta or whatever he is.

32:59.780 --> 33:02.340
Jeff, you've been trying to get fired for a long time.

33:03.380 --> 33:05.460
I feel like you've finally crossed the line.

33:05.460 --> 33:07.060
Outlandish plan yet.

33:07.060 --> 33:10.660
Again, or he's gonna do this in the middle of his local park,

33:10.660 --> 33:14.180
and people will be like, this is Jif Smooth's magnum opus.

33:14.180 --> 33:17.540
Or he'll do it on NBC late nights,

33:17.540 --> 33:21.940
and have Guy Fieri give him a hundred thousand dollars on minute to win it.

33:21.940 --> 33:24.260
That's basically what minute to win it is, just making a giant peanut butter.

33:24.260 --> 33:24.580
I bet.

33:24.580 --> 33:26.980
You have 60 seconds to get so nasty.

33:28.900 --> 33:32.580
If you can cut yourself a peanut butter then steal my head visor,

33:32.580 --> 33:34.180
I'm gonna give you a hundred thousand dollars.

33:35.220 --> 33:37.060
Let's play Meme to Meme.

33:37.700 --> 33:38.740
I have not seen this yet.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.620
Oh, he's got peanut butter stuck in his mouth.

33:43.860 --> 33:46.020
Why are you licking Jif Smooth off?

33:46.020 --> 33:50.660
Can we create a reality TV show that's like sort of most dangerous game,

33:50.660 --> 33:53.140
like or Hard Target is a better example,

33:53.140 --> 33:56.580
where it's just you have to find Guy Fieri and take his head wear.

33:59.220 --> 34:00.100
Make it your own.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.020
Like a Lord of the Flies kind of thing?

34:02.580 --> 34:07.780
Yeah, it would be sort of like the Amazing Race mixed with Hostile,

34:07.780 --> 34:10.820
because you have to take his head, too.

34:10.820 --> 34:12.900
You gotta take the head of Guy Fieri.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.620
Bring me the head of Guy Fieri.

34:15.620 --> 34:20.260
Well, all his life power is bound to his head visor.

34:21.780 --> 34:28.420
That is the sort of the magical root that animates his Golem-esque body.

34:28.420 --> 34:31.300
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.100
Hey, you know what?

34:32.100 --> 34:33.220
You guys laugh it up.

34:33.220 --> 34:36.260
Man makes a hell of a Tex-Mex salad plate.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.900
That man makes a great Chinese.

34:40.900 --> 34:46.900
Yum, yum, yum.

34:46.900 --> 34:48.180
Yum, yum, give me some.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.260
For the last year and a half,

34:50.260 --> 34:53.220
a friend of our family has been staying on our couch Monday through Friday.

34:53.780 --> 34:58.100
He works in Manhattan during the week, returns to his family upstate on the weekend.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.740
My question is, how do I let him know he needs to find another couch

35:00.740 --> 35:04.500
without being the asshole who stops him from providing for his family?

35:04.500 --> 35:05.940
Bewildered in Brooklyn.

35:07.140 --> 35:08.500
Wow, that's a toughie.

35:08.500 --> 35:12.420
Hey, I do want to alleviate your guilt though.

35:14.580 --> 35:18.020
You are not, like, you're not stopping him from providing.

35:18.020 --> 35:19.540
He's not providing for his family.

35:19.540 --> 35:20.980
He's living on your couch.

35:20.980 --> 35:22.580
You're providing for his family.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.140
You're meeting him halfway here.

35:25.780 --> 35:27.220
A year and a half?

35:28.180 --> 35:29.140
It's no big deal.

35:29.140 --> 35:31.380
No, that seems like the kind of thing you do where you say,

35:31.380 --> 35:34.980
hey, I need to do this until I can find other arrangements.

35:34.980 --> 35:41.620
It's just 500 days of Devin, just 500 days of Devin just crashing on the couch.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.940
This is fucking you, me, and Dupree's shit.

35:44.420 --> 35:48.660
Hey, when people go to look for a place to live, they do that.

35:48.660 --> 35:50.980
Like, this is not how people do.

35:50.980 --> 35:52.820
Like, we get places to live in.

35:53.700 --> 35:54.100
Yeah.

35:54.100 --> 35:58.900
We find a place to live and then we live in it every day of the week.

35:58.900 --> 36:04.340
Is he in any way, like, compensating you or, like, paying you for bills or?

36:04.340 --> 36:07.460
Rent or something?

36:07.460 --> 36:10.260
Listen, I want you to know something, friend of the show.

36:11.700 --> 36:17.700
You should have, like, guilt should not even be in your, like,

36:17.700 --> 36:19.540
you could not be further from the asshole.

36:19.540 --> 36:24.420
You could set the couch on fire and throw it out a window while he's sleeping on it.

36:24.420 --> 36:27.460
You still would not be the bad guy in the situation.

36:27.460 --> 36:32.660
Yeah, I think all you have to do is say, listen, it's been a while now

36:32.660 --> 36:35.220
and I'd like to know what the permanent solution is.

36:35.220 --> 36:36.340
A while?

36:36.340 --> 36:38.500
It's been a goddamn year and a half.

36:38.500 --> 36:38.740
Yeah.

36:39.620 --> 36:41.140
It's been all the while.

36:41.140 --> 36:42.820
Seasons have changed.

36:42.820 --> 36:44.820
Winter has melted into spring.

36:45.540 --> 36:45.940
A young man's-

36:45.940 --> 36:47.940
Now it's time for you to get the fuck out.

36:47.940 --> 36:50.820
A young man's fancy has turned to fucking leave.

36:50.820 --> 36:52.020
Get out of my house.

36:52.020 --> 36:56.420
If this living situation were a human being, it would be, like, walking and almost talking.

36:56.420 --> 36:57.060
Yeah.

36:57.060 --> 36:58.020
Yeah, it is talking.

36:58.020 --> 37:00.100
It's saying, get the fuck out of my house.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.860
Fucking leave.

37:01.860 --> 37:03.620
I want to sit on that couch.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.460
It smells like you forever.

37:05.460 --> 37:07.140
It smells like you sleep.

37:07.140 --> 37:09.060
It smells like you when you're asleep.

37:09.060 --> 37:09.860
I hate it here.

37:10.740 --> 37:11.460
I'm moving.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.580
You can stay if you want.

37:13.780 --> 37:16.820
How is your friend comfortable with this living arrangement?

37:17.540 --> 37:18.980
Well, it's a great couch.

37:18.980 --> 37:23.860
I don't want to pass judgment here, but I can't imagine living on someone's couch

37:23.860 --> 37:28.820
for five days a week for a year and a half and not feeling like an asshole myself.

37:28.820 --> 37:34.340
I have this theory that living in New York is kind of like living in an awesome

37:34.340 --> 37:38.500
but also post-apocalyptic world where it's like, we just got to survive, man.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.860
We got to survive so we can go get to the good parts.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.380
Oh, so it's like catch as catch can.

37:43.380 --> 37:45.940
Like, you find a closet to sleep in and you sleep there.

37:45.940 --> 37:52.260
I saw this video of this gentleman who was living in an apartment that was 63 square feet.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.420
63 square feet.

37:55.220 --> 37:58.420
His bed turned into a couch with the use of special panels,

37:58.420 --> 38:01.300
and he kept his microwave in his clothing closet.

38:01.940 --> 38:02.820
Oh, no.

38:02.820 --> 38:03.940
That's not an apartment.

38:04.580 --> 38:05.860
That is not an apartment.

38:05.860 --> 38:06.980
That is a boxcar.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.500
You are a boxcar hobo.

38:09.060 --> 38:12.820
But think about what a great scene that's going to be when they do his true Hollywood story

38:12.820 --> 38:14.500
because he turns into a famous actor.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.860
He was totally happy about it.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.780
He's like, oh, I prefer, you know, I just I go out and do all my business in the city,

38:19.780 --> 38:20.660
and then I come home.

38:20.660 --> 38:21.860
I just sleep in here.

38:21.860 --> 38:24.500
And it's like, yeah, but that's what like prisoners say.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.180
I live in this Iron Maiden.

38:26.180 --> 38:28.500
It's rent controlled, so that's pretty nice.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.340
It's just $850 a month, no bills included.

38:32.340 --> 38:34.100
It's it gets pretty cold.

38:34.100 --> 38:38.580
It gets pretty cold in the winter, but my four friends just come in and sleep on top of me.

38:38.580 --> 38:43.140
Make a human peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

38:43.140 --> 38:43.620
Yeah.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.220
Do you know what he paid for that apartment?

38:45.940 --> 38:47.220
Like 800 bucks.

38:47.220 --> 38:47.700
Yeah.

38:48.420 --> 38:50.500
That's that's not OK, guys.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.420
So, yeah, kick your friend out.

38:52.420 --> 38:54.340
Kick him the fu- Hey, you know what?

38:54.340 --> 38:55.860
Hey, you know what?

38:55.860 --> 38:56.260
You know what?

38:56.260 --> 38:56.660
Seriously?

38:56.660 --> 38:57.700
Not not even a joke.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.540
I know this would be an aqua moment for you.

38:59.540 --> 39:00.740
Take us over there.

39:00.740 --> 39:01.300
Pick us up.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.100
Carry us over there.

39:02.820 --> 39:03.300
You're on.

39:03.300 --> 39:04.180
Pick up the computer.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.100
Lug us over there.

39:06.100 --> 39:06.900
Hey, friend.

39:07.540 --> 39:11.460
Hey, listen, these times that, you know, you know what?

39:11.460 --> 39:13.700
I'm not even going to do the nice thing is being a year and a half.

39:13.700 --> 39:14.260
Time to go.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.060
Yeah.

39:15.060 --> 39:16.900
Time to time to fish.

39:16.900 --> 39:17.460
What is it?

39:17.460 --> 39:21.140
Fish and friends keep for three days.

39:21.140 --> 39:21.300
Yeah.

39:21.300 --> 39:21.700
What is it?

39:21.700 --> 39:22.260
What's the thing?

39:22.260 --> 39:23.380
Fish and friends?

39:23.380 --> 39:27.860
Yeah, you you wrap up your friends in some newspaper and you toss them to people and

39:27.860 --> 39:29.540
then you throw them out the door.

39:29.540 --> 39:31.540
Yeah, it's it's time to come.

39:31.540 --> 39:35.220
Company and poultry stink after a week.

39:36.500 --> 39:40.820
That's what that's what the quotables please, please go.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.940
Yeah, I now I'm talking to Griffin also.

39:44.980 --> 39:48.180
But the friend friend, you've been sleeping on the couch.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.780
We've all had some good times.

39:49.780 --> 39:54.260
It was the one time when Jeff brought over the whiskey and you guys got really drunk.

39:54.260 --> 39:54.740
It was great.

39:54.740 --> 39:55.300
And everybody.

39:55.300 --> 39:55.940
It's time to go.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.100
It's gone far enough.

39:59.140 --> 39:59.860
It's time to leave.

40:01.860 --> 40:02.580
It's time to go.

40:03.700 --> 40:04.740
Are you going?

40:04.740 --> 40:06.020
You're still out now.

40:06.020 --> 40:06.980
Pick up the gun.

40:06.980 --> 40:07.780
Is he gone?

40:07.780 --> 40:08.900
Hey, pick up a bag.

40:09.700 --> 40:10.820
Put your things in the bag.

40:10.820 --> 40:11.220
That's right.

40:11.220 --> 40:13.460
You don't have anything because you're sleeping on the couch and just go.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.300
Go find a partner.

40:15.300 --> 40:17.380
Find a bag that's big enough for your things.

40:17.380 --> 40:22.500
Collect them and skedaddle, skedaddle, just GTFO.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.100
Come on, it is.

40:24.740 --> 40:25.860
Let me check my watch.

40:25.860 --> 40:26.820
Bounce a clock.

40:27.940 --> 40:28.580
Time to bounce.

40:28.580 --> 40:29.780
Why are you still here?

40:31.460 --> 40:32.100
Get out.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.300
No, we can hear you.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.700
Just pretended to walk away and then froze.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.540
We heard you open the door and then shut it.

40:37.540 --> 40:38.900
It is dip time.

40:38.900 --> 40:40.180
It is time to dip.

40:40.180 --> 40:40.740
Go.

40:40.740 --> 40:41.780
You're still here.

40:41.780 --> 40:41.780
Go.

40:41.780 --> 40:46.260
You're still here.

40:46.260 --> 40:46.580
Go.

40:46.580 --> 40:47.620
Close the door behind you.

40:48.740 --> 40:49.700
Now don't come back.

40:50.900 --> 40:51.540
Change the locks.

40:51.540 --> 40:53.060
Quick, quick.

40:53.780 --> 40:55.540
Get a two by four and board it up.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.100
Board it up.

40:56.100 --> 40:59.220
Now listen, you got to leave through the window and you can never come back.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.140
They can never see you again.

41:01.140 --> 41:02.180
You're a ghost now.

41:02.180 --> 41:02.820
You hear me?

41:02.820 --> 41:03.460
You're a ghost.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.660
Why are you still here?

41:04.660 --> 41:05.780
You need to go too.

41:05.780 --> 41:09.620
You got to go and do a gas station bathroom and cut and dye your hair.

41:09.620 --> 41:13.140
Shave off your beard, change your clothes and never come back there.

41:13.140 --> 41:13.780
Change your name.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.820
Now, quick, wait, wait, come back.

41:16.820 --> 41:17.620
Come back.

41:17.620 --> 41:21.220
Turn us around towards the TV and put on Steve Wilkos.

41:22.020 --> 41:22.500
Now go.

41:26.020 --> 41:26.980
This is our house now.

41:27.700 --> 41:29.380
Man, this couch chair is comfortable.

41:29.380 --> 41:30.980
I get why you slept on it for 500 days.

41:30.980 --> 41:31.620
Oh, man.

41:32.900 --> 41:33.540
Free apartment.

41:33.540 --> 41:34.500
You got any fun Joes?

41:35.460 --> 41:35.940
That's all right.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.060
We'll find them later.

41:37.060 --> 41:37.700
We'll walk around.

41:37.700 --> 41:38.500
Where are the fun Joes at?

41:38.500 --> 41:39.460
Going to dip them.

41:39.460 --> 41:40.260
We're going to evolve.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.820
So this is our pad now.

41:45.620 --> 41:46.500
It's pretty nice.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.140
Yeah, it's nice.

41:47.140 --> 41:48.980
I like it, especially the couch.

41:48.980 --> 41:52.100
I'm going to ask you guys to leave because I have a girl coming over.

41:52.100 --> 41:52.660
Oh, okay.

41:52.660 --> 41:53.620
Oh, yeah, no worries.

41:53.620 --> 41:54.500
No sweat.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.940
She's on a MacBook Pro.

41:55.940 --> 41:57.060
It's casual.

41:58.420 --> 42:00.500
I recently started dating this amazing girl.

42:00.500 --> 42:04.340
We only have been dating for the past three weeks, but I can tell there's a true connection.

42:04.340 --> 42:07.620
The problem is we're both in our mid-20s back living at home,

42:07.620 --> 42:08.980
trying to get back on our feet.

42:08.980 --> 42:11.380
Neither of us are that happy with our current living situation.

42:11.380 --> 42:16.020
My question is, is it too early to see if she's interested in looking for a place to live?

42:16.020 --> 42:19.700
And if she wants to make a roommate out of her new and super fun boyfriend,

42:19.700 --> 42:21.460
lovebirds leaving the nest.

42:23.460 --> 42:24.820
I know what my answer is.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.140
That's a tough one, man.

42:29.700 --> 42:30.820
Three weeks.

42:30.820 --> 42:32.580
Three weeks is not a lot of weeks.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.260
That's not very many weeks.

42:34.260 --> 42:34.980
Here's the thing.

42:34.980 --> 42:39.220
I don't think it's too early.

42:39.220 --> 42:41.060
I just don't know what the rush is.

42:41.060 --> 42:43.620
Like, are you about to get kicked out of your house?

42:43.620 --> 42:44.740
You know what I mean?

42:44.740 --> 42:49.460
Like, maybe talk about this in like a month or two.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.300
Yeah, I'm all for rushing it, but you're going to sign a year lease.

42:53.300 --> 42:55.700
And like, that could be really uncomfortable.

42:56.340 --> 43:00.260
Well, like Teresa and I, both of our leases were ending at the same time.

43:00.900 --> 43:03.140
And we'd been together for about two or three months.

43:03.140 --> 43:07.380
And we realized that it was stupid to get two separate one bedroom apartments.

43:08.180 --> 43:11.060
So we just got one bedroom apartment together.

43:11.060 --> 43:12.500
Can you find a month to month?

43:13.780 --> 43:17.460
That's the true sign of love right there, is a month to month.

43:17.460 --> 43:18.900
A month to month is a true sign of love?

43:19.780 --> 43:22.980
Yeah, because it's like, I respect you, you respect me.

43:22.980 --> 43:24.980
This might work out, it might not.

43:24.980 --> 43:28.020
But regardless, if we get angry in September,

43:28.580 --> 43:30.900
we can stop seeing each other in October.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.060
We don't have to wait until May.

43:33.060 --> 43:34.500
We will have to wait to the end of the month, though.

43:35.700 --> 43:39.940
Yeah, try to hold off that fight to at least like the 23rd.

43:39.940 --> 43:41.380
Like, you terrible bit.

43:41.380 --> 43:42.180
Oh, wait, hold on.

43:42.180 --> 43:43.060
Oh, it's the 15th.

43:43.620 --> 43:44.660
Just you wait.

43:44.660 --> 43:45.460
Just you wait.

43:45.460 --> 43:47.220
I'm putting this in my journal.

43:47.220 --> 43:48.260
You're gonna get it.

43:48.820 --> 43:52.420
That would actually be a really good relationship tincture, I think.

43:52.420 --> 43:54.180
If every time you were gonna have a fight,

43:54.180 --> 43:56.100
you had to wait to the end of the month to have it.

43:56.100 --> 43:56.420
Uh-huh.

43:57.140 --> 43:58.020
You would never fight.

43:58.900 --> 44:00.020
You would never fight.

44:00.020 --> 44:00.980
It would be great.

44:00.980 --> 44:01.460
Except on the 30th.

44:01.460 --> 44:03.380
And then you would fucking explode.

44:04.500 --> 44:06.020
Fucking cage match.

44:06.020 --> 44:06.340
Yeah.

44:06.340 --> 44:12.580
Um, I would say wait at least another month and really just maul it over.

44:12.580 --> 44:13.940
Because you've got nowhere to go.

44:14.500 --> 44:16.340
Like, your parents aren't kicking you out.

44:16.340 --> 44:18.980
But they do, but maybe they have apartments where they're,

44:18.980 --> 44:20.420
oh, they're living at home.

44:21.780 --> 44:25.220
Just wait another month and give this a lot of thought

44:25.220 --> 44:28.900
and think about, is this a person I want to spend at least a year,

44:28.900 --> 44:32.100
if not more, with and then start talking about it.

44:32.660 --> 44:34.260
You don't have to do it right away.

44:34.260 --> 44:38.260
Start talking about it and then wait like another month.

44:38.260 --> 44:39.780
Yeah, another month after that month.

44:41.060 --> 44:48.740
So we're saying four months and then maybe consider doing it like six months out.

44:48.740 --> 44:49.940
So 10 months.

44:49.940 --> 44:51.940
The thing is, is living together,

44:52.980 --> 44:55.700
it doesn't matter how awesome you think each other are.

44:55.700 --> 44:59.060
There are going to be things that they do.

45:00.100 --> 45:04.020
Every human being has things that they do that get on your nerves.

45:04.020 --> 45:05.140
Some more than others.

45:05.140 --> 45:05.700
Yeah.

45:05.700 --> 45:10.260
And so living together is what you do after you love each other so much

45:10.260 --> 45:12.020
that those things don't matter.

45:12.020 --> 45:12.740
Yeah.

45:12.740 --> 45:17.300
That you can go, okay, it annoys me that you always eat the last waffle.

45:17.300 --> 45:20.340
But I love you so much that I just don't care.

45:20.340 --> 45:22.020
Is that a concern for you, Travis?

45:22.020 --> 45:23.220
God, I love waffles.

45:23.220 --> 45:28.420
I worry that three weeks in, you barely know each other well enough

45:29.220 --> 45:31.700
to even like consider living together.

45:33.220 --> 45:35.300
Yeah, I mean, it's really early, dog.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.420
I'm sure you're cool.

45:38.420 --> 45:42.180
I think it's beautiful that you are thinking about it now.

45:42.180 --> 45:43.860
I'm happy that you're so in love.

45:43.860 --> 45:44.580
Yeah.

45:44.580 --> 45:48.580
It's also going to put a lot of pressure on your relationship early that you may not want.

45:48.580 --> 45:51.380
But at the same time, maybe you should just do it.

45:51.380 --> 45:55.060
But here's the other thing, three weeks in, you have to talk about money

45:55.060 --> 45:56.660
and who's going to pay for what bills.

45:56.660 --> 45:58.980
Oh, love will find a way, Travis.

45:58.980 --> 45:59.940
What happened to your heart?

45:59.940 --> 46:00.740
Love will find a way.

46:00.740 --> 46:02.260
What did Vin Diesel say?

46:02.260 --> 46:05.380
That you either have to get busy living together or get busy dying together.

46:06.020 --> 46:07.060
I think it's time.

46:07.060 --> 46:07.860
I think, you know what?

46:07.860 --> 46:09.060
I think you're one week late.

46:09.940 --> 46:10.500
Oh.

46:10.500 --> 46:11.940
I think you're one week late to the party.

46:11.940 --> 46:13.940
I feel like 14 days is long enough to know.

46:13.940 --> 46:18.420
Okay, then let's flip the script here and say if he's going to bring it up,

46:18.420 --> 46:19.380
how does he bring it up?

46:19.380 --> 46:22.900
Hey, you know how we've been seeing each other for approximately 22 days?

46:24.900 --> 46:28.100
Maybe we should cohabitate because what did Vin Diesel say?

46:28.100 --> 46:30.420
He said, get busy living together, get busy dying together.

46:30.420 --> 46:33.220
And then you have Vin Diesel there to ask her.

46:34.180 --> 46:36.500
He says, hey, Mallory.

46:36.500 --> 46:38.420
Mallory, will you live in sin with Jeff?

46:39.220 --> 46:40.260
With Jeff Smith?

46:40.260 --> 46:41.700
With Jeff Smith.

46:42.180 --> 46:44.420
He's going to get into some weird things so you just got to stay by him.

46:44.420 --> 46:44.980
He's pretty cool.

46:44.980 --> 46:47.620
He's a good roommate except for this one thing.

46:47.620 --> 46:48.420
There's his room.

46:48.420 --> 46:50.260
There's this one little thing.

46:51.780 --> 46:54.580
So here's my other advice if you're just going to jump in.

46:55.460 --> 47:03.300
Like full immersion therapy, tell her every annoying thing that you do

47:03.300 --> 47:05.940
and make her tell you every annoying thing that she does.

47:05.940 --> 47:07.380
Day one, lock the doors.

47:08.260 --> 47:12.180
I'm telling you, this is what Teresa and I did after knowing each other for like three

47:12.180 --> 47:13.620
or four months and moving in together.

47:13.620 --> 47:16.260
I sat her down and said, you know, I am messy.

47:16.260 --> 47:18.020
I leave shit all over the floor.

47:18.020 --> 47:20.980
He's still listening to them today every Tuesday.

47:20.980 --> 47:21.620
Oh, I forgot.

47:22.260 --> 47:23.300
Wait, hold on.

47:23.300 --> 47:24.260
I thought I said something else.

47:25.220 --> 47:28.020
When I spit out my toothpaste, I just spit it right into the mirror.

47:28.020 --> 47:28.520
Yep.

47:29.940 --> 47:31.700
And then I draw faces in it.

47:31.700 --> 47:32.420
It's pretty cool.

47:32.420 --> 47:33.220
I'm a monster.

47:34.820 --> 47:38.420
Yeah, just make sure that you both communicate everything.

47:39.380 --> 47:42.660
Even, you know, after you live together because that's the downfall of living together.

47:42.660 --> 47:47.700
If you don't communicate, you will harbor resentment towards each other for the littlest things.

47:47.700 --> 47:50.420
If you don't communicate, you're going to communicate.

47:50.420 --> 47:51.860
Yeah, that's what Vin Diesel says.

47:51.860 --> 47:53.220
That is what Vin Diesel said.

47:53.220 --> 47:55.620
Have you been reading like Vin Diesel books or something?

47:55.620 --> 47:57.780
Is he like a motivational guy now?

47:57.780 --> 48:02.500
10 tips, 10 tools to being a more effective lover by Vin Diesel.

48:02.500 --> 48:03.780
I do find him very motivating.

48:03.780 --> 48:05.540
That sounds beautiful, Griffin.

48:05.540 --> 48:06.500
It is beautiful.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.740
He's he's got a beautiful mind and heart.

48:08.740 --> 48:10.020
Have you seen Pitch Black?

48:12.100 --> 48:13.940
I want to hear Griffin's last question first.

48:13.940 --> 48:18.500
Real quick, housekeeping maxfundstore.org you can get or maxfundstore.com.

48:18.500 --> 48:25.460
You can get your t-shirts, MB&B AM t-shirts and other Max Fund podcast t-shirts.

48:25.460 --> 48:26.500
There's some really cool ones.

48:26.500 --> 48:28.020
Are you guys listening to those?

48:28.020 --> 48:29.620
Oh, God, I sure hope you are.

48:29.620 --> 48:31.140
Yeah, they're all really funny.

48:31.140 --> 48:34.500
Jordan Jesse Goh just did an episode with fucking Joshua Molina.

48:34.500 --> 48:35.700
Are you kidding me?

48:35.700 --> 48:42.660
Josh Molina, who a lot of people say his name is the best part of the lyrics I wrote to the West Wing theme song.

48:42.660 --> 48:45.940
So, so that was quite the get for that.

48:45.940 --> 48:48.900
My favorite part is Richard Schiff.

48:48.900 --> 48:51.300
You like that part?

48:51.300 --> 48:53.060
Look for it on YouTube, everybody.

48:53.060 --> 48:53.460
It's there.

48:53.460 --> 48:54.260
Just got to dig it up.

48:55.860 --> 48:57.780
What else has got what else we got cooking?

48:57.780 --> 49:02.660
What else is we haven't talked about a while, but there are some really fun Max Fund forums.

49:02.660 --> 49:05.460
If you haven't checked them out, it's a really great community.

49:06.500 --> 49:12.580
And every time we post a show that day, like as soon as we post it, there's a forum entry

49:12.580 --> 49:15.060
about us, a thread that starts about that episode.

49:15.060 --> 49:17.940
So if you have comments you want to make, or if you just want to talk about the show,

49:17.940 --> 49:21.940
make sure that you go to the Max Fund forums and check it out and post on there.

49:24.340 --> 49:28.660
Some people get in touch with us about us doing guest spots on their podcast.

49:28.660 --> 49:29.460
We'd love to do that.

49:30.180 --> 49:32.180
Note that it probably won't be all three of us.

49:32.180 --> 49:34.580
It's hard enough to get us in one room to record.

49:34.580 --> 49:37.540
And outside of the hour we record the show, we really hate each other.

49:37.540 --> 49:39.460
Yeah, we really do not do not talk much.

49:39.460 --> 49:40.100
But that's not true.

49:40.100 --> 49:40.820
I love you guys.

49:40.820 --> 49:45.060
But make sure you email us nbnbam at maximum fun.org.

49:45.060 --> 49:46.180
Don't tweet at us.

49:46.180 --> 49:46.900
Don't tweet it.

49:46.900 --> 49:49.060
It gets lost in the ether and the shuffle.

49:49.620 --> 49:55.380
That said, if you do have that NBA hashtag, set it up because it is locked in there.

49:56.740 --> 50:00.500
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of their song.

50:00.500 --> 50:04.340
It's a departure from the album, putting the days to bed, which we use as our theme

50:04.340 --> 50:05.380
song and money zone break.

50:06.420 --> 50:10.180
If you haven't listened to his new podcast with Merlin man Roderick on the line, they

50:10.180 --> 50:11.460
just did their second episode.

50:11.460 --> 50:12.500
It's super good.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.260
Yeah, we need to get that on the network.

50:14.260 --> 50:17.780
I'm going to sign them up.

50:17.780 --> 50:20.020
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show.

50:20.900 --> 50:28.660
Duckloft 13, Alex Batty, Church's wife back in the saddle, as it were.

50:29.940 --> 50:31.860
Fathom, so many.

50:31.860 --> 50:35.460
Radstromical, so many great people.

50:35.460 --> 50:37.620
Trey Cup, back in full effect.

50:37.620 --> 50:40.820
Gowdy James, who got engaged.

50:40.820 --> 50:43.460
Daddy James Gowdy.

50:43.460 --> 50:45.940
Yeah, he's having a first.

50:45.940 --> 50:47.620
He put down those riots.

50:47.620 --> 50:48.980
Kimbo 2042.

50:48.980 --> 50:49.860
Thank you, everybody.

50:49.860 --> 50:50.660
You're all the best.

50:50.660 --> 50:51.860
Jeff Whart, everybody.

50:51.860 --> 50:52.820
You're all the best people.

50:54.660 --> 50:55.620
So God bless you.

50:56.180 --> 50:58.420
And thank you for tweeting about the show.

50:58.420 --> 50:59.860
NBMA hashtag.

50:59.860 --> 51:00.580
Just do it.

51:01.780 --> 51:02.420
Is that everything?

51:02.420 --> 51:03.540
I feel like that's everything.

51:03.540 --> 51:04.660
We're trying to get that quicker.

51:04.660 --> 51:05.860
I feel like that was pretty quick.

51:05.860 --> 51:06.980
We're doing a bad job, though.

51:06.980 --> 51:08.180
Let's just shut it down.

51:08.900 --> 51:11.620
This final question was sent in by Catherine Morale,

51:11.620 --> 51:14.260
whose name I said very wrong last week.

51:14.260 --> 51:16.260
And I would like to take this time to formally apologize.

51:16.260 --> 51:16.900
Sorry about that.

51:17.620 --> 51:18.980
She just got married, too.

51:18.980 --> 51:20.740
And her new name is Rude.

51:21.780 --> 51:22.340
That's kind of a...

51:23.380 --> 51:24.820
I've gone far too long.

51:24.820 --> 51:26.100
Catherine Morale, Rude.

51:26.100 --> 51:26.580
Thank you.

51:27.940 --> 51:28.660
It's asked by Yahoo!

51:28.660 --> 51:33.140
answers user, no chance without Christ puncher.

51:33.140 --> 51:36.980
Who asks, in all caps, so I'm going to yell it.

51:37.940 --> 51:41.860
Was that dog Eddie on Frasier, a real dog or computer generated?

51:44.820 --> 51:46.020
I'm Justin McElroy.

51:46.020 --> 51:47.220
I'm Travis McElroy.

51:47.220 --> 51:48.500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.100
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

51:50.100 --> 51:51.140
Kiss your dad.

51:51.140 --> 51:52.180
Square on the lips.

51:56.020 --> 51:57.620
Keep your heart, three stacks.

51:57.620 --> 51:58.660
Keep your heart.

51:58.660 --> 52:00.260
Hey, keep your heart.

52:00.260 --> 52:01.700
Hey, keep your heart.

52:01.700 --> 52:03.380
Hey, keep your heart.

52:03.380 --> 52:04.260
Three stacks.

52:04.260 --> 52:05.300
Keep your heart.

52:05.300 --> 52:06.580
Man, these girls are smart.

52:06.580 --> 52:07.220
Three stacks.

52:07.220 --> 52:08.340
These girls are smart.

52:08.340 --> 52:34.900
Play your part, play your part.
