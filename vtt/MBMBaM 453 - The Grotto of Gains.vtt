The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.680
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:47.680 --> 00:52.960
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy.

00:54.320 --> 00:59.840
And I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Hey Griff, what's wrong? Why are you being so

00:59.840 --> 01:04.880
quiet? It's gonna it's gonna be a skit. Oh I didn't oh I didn't want to worry you guys and

01:04.880 --> 01:09.440
I'll cut this out but it's gonna be a sketch. I know it's a sketch. I'm playing along. We're

01:09.440 --> 01:13.360
trying to lead into the- No and I'll cut this part out but I didn't want the two of you guys

01:13.360 --> 01:21.120
to be afraid. Okay let me I'll get back in now. Well I'm just I'm so scared of um listen listen

01:21.120 --> 01:30.160
I'll cut that out too. Listen the PGA Tour has made is marched on Austin and taken over the town and

01:30.160 --> 01:38.240
there's- PGA? Yeah professional golfers all right and they've made their way to Austin. All the

01:38.240 --> 01:45.520
weirdos from South By just left and in the void they left all these rich jocks showed up and

01:45.520 --> 01:50.320
started just golfing wherever the fuck they wanted. I don't know if the PGA Tour has ever been in the

01:50.320 --> 01:56.160
city where you live but it's just like my house is covered in holes from their powerful drives

01:56.160 --> 02:01.760
that they just blast right through. Are they doing like and one street golf? They're doing and one

02:01.760 --> 02:07.200
street golf extreme street golf. I saw Rory McIlroy first of all he's been tormenting me

02:07.200 --> 02:11.840
because he says he he keeps saying I want it back and that's what he sounds that's what he sounds

02:11.840 --> 02:15.600
like as he yells at me and my family through the windows of my house and while he's blasting me with

02:15.600 --> 02:21.920
balls um but then I see- Once what back? The name I guess even though it's spelled different I told

02:21.920 --> 02:27.280
him that but then a ball hit me in the head and I went to sleep for an hour um but I did see him

02:27.280 --> 02:33.280
playing some extreme street golf with the other big golfers of today. Name three other ones. Yeah

02:33.280 --> 02:39.040
sure Rory McIlroy is one. Well you already said that one three other ones. One and and you know

02:39.040 --> 02:44.240
three other ones that don't have your name let's just like go for it. Okay can I do Tiger? Yeah

02:44.240 --> 02:54.160
yeah yeah. Tigers? Tiger? Yes. Jack Nicklaus. Golden Bear. Golden Bear and I think there's one

02:54.160 --> 02:59.840
named Buddy. Anyway he's I saw Rory McIlroy take a golf ball and run and slam dunk it into a hole

02:59.840 --> 03:05.040
that he made in the street that's a pothole now my son's gonna trip in um it's real tough stuff

03:05.040 --> 03:08.960
it's real tough I would think after we got rich from the max fun drive that I would start liking

03:08.960 --> 03:15.760
golf more but it's the way they're doing it is very riotous it's very destructive. Uh yeah just

03:15.760 --> 03:20.240
a quick side note thank you everyone who donated we're recording this on the Wednesday uh previous

03:20.240 --> 03:25.760
so I have to assume we just ended up at like 60,000 new and upgrading. I assume we're extremely

03:25.760 --> 03:32.880
wealthy Travis pass me one of those kahibas that I purchased prematurely and will eventually regret

03:32.880 --> 03:37.680
I'm sure. Griffin have you thought about getting super good at it yourself to like well if you

03:37.680 --> 03:42.640
can't beat them join them and then beat them? Uh I mean I've been thinking about it slide me one

03:42.640 --> 03:46.560
of those stinky smoke logs too while you're at it Travy. Yeah of course of course. It's just

03:47.280 --> 03:54.640
let me light it with this other stinky. It's just for looks I don't light it um I and so

03:54.640 --> 04:04.560
I thought about getting good at golf Travis but you know my my elbow. Yeah so I'm sorry I forgot

04:04.560 --> 04:11.680
about that Griffin. I forgot about the hinge and the flaps in there. If you hear a loud smash and

04:11.680 --> 04:19.200
then uh you know or maybe a four and then a smash uh it's because the PGA Tour has uh is doing it

04:19.200 --> 04:28.320
in Austin. The end. Okay. Oh Griffin look out behind you a golf ball's coming your way. Uh oh.

04:28.320 --> 04:36.160
That was supposed to be my glass breaking noise. Fuck. Fuck me Justin. God damn it. You know what

04:36.160 --> 04:41.920
what's weird what's weird is I have Seinfeld glass uh in every window of my house and it's great

04:41.920 --> 04:45.520
because it's insular which is great because it keeps the AC in in the hot summer and but the

04:45.520 --> 04:50.240
only bad thing is when it smashes like when Michael Richards jumps through it it doesn't

04:50.240 --> 04:55.040
make the traditional noise it does make the boogie ball wow wow. Should I have a Michael

04:55.040 --> 04:59.920
Richards more Michael Richards representation on the soundboard? No. I think the only sort of

04:59.920 --> 05:05.200
clip that he's known for would not work very well on our show because of our format. Yeah how

05:05.200 --> 05:10.880
horrible it is and he is and all that jazz. Well this is an advice show that is funded by you

05:11.680 --> 05:16.080
the listeners and uh we do appreciate you just not to harp on it but it's like

05:16.720 --> 05:21.360
and we have a lot of fun here but it really means a lot to us so thank you so much for your

05:21.360 --> 05:26.800
eternal support. Um did I not mention it was an eternal pledge you're making? Yeah this is forever.

05:27.520 --> 05:33.280
Yeah this is forever. Uh let's get into the advice. I work in wildlife rehabilitation.

05:33.280 --> 05:38.400
One week into this job I was cleaning one of the owls enclosures. Justin did you use your new

05:38.400 --> 05:43.200
found max fund wealth to buy a new narrator voice? Yeah it's nice it sounds like you've got four or

05:43.200 --> 05:47.840
five Cohibas going in there. Do you know what's irritating? Why? One of the reasons I really don't

05:47.840 --> 05:51.680
enjoy you guys and wow this is much more professional it's more of a professional

05:51.680 --> 05:56.560
relationship at this point than a familiar one yeah is because I was in my head thinking like

05:56.560 --> 06:04.560
this is sounding good. I was already congratulating myself for how well I was reading it and not

06:04.560 --> 06:10.320
stumbling or messing it up at all and then you fucking dill wheat. It was nice it was good.

06:10.320 --> 06:16.240
Yeah it was like I just wanted to finish it with like my streak. All right try again. I work in

06:16.240 --> 06:21.360
wildlife rehabilitation. One week into this job I was cleaning one of the owls enclosures and when

06:21.360 --> 06:25.920
I turned to leave she attacked the back of my head. She didn't draw blood but I definitely felt

06:25.920 --> 06:32.080
her talons graze my scalp. It was startling as fuck and since then the owl and I have had a

06:32.080 --> 06:37.200
strained relationship. I feel like she hates me. How do I learn to trust this animal again? And

06:37.200 --> 06:44.800
that's from living in fear in Louisiana. Sounds like you need to get the animal to trust you

06:44.800 --> 06:52.720
first and foremost. And with owls that that's a tough one. That's a tough one with owls. They're

06:52.720 --> 06:59.360
a tricky they're a tricky one because um of the ill omens and all that yeah sure you could throw

06:59.360 --> 07:04.240
up a you know field mouse for them to catch and play a big game with that but then you know the

07:04.240 --> 07:07.920
field mouse certainly is not going to trust you at that point. You can you can try to do something

07:07.920 --> 07:11.760
behind an owl's back but it's just going to turn right the fuck around and see it with that crazy

07:11.760 --> 07:17.600
head they have. That weird head. When you were attacked did you snitch on them? Did you go tell

07:17.600 --> 07:22.400
like the head of the wildlife or maybe the owl was testing to see if you could keep your mouth shut?

07:22.400 --> 07:30.560
That's amazing. When I was in elementary school uh I my my my friend well we were more acquaintances

07:30.560 --> 07:34.720
John cut in front of me he had about a foot and a half on me and he cut in front of me in the

07:34.720 --> 07:38.800
four square line I said hey you just cut in front of me and he slapped he slapped me on the face

07:38.800 --> 07:45.120
and I guess somebody reported it and we got sent to the principal's office and I didn't fucking

07:45.120 --> 07:51.840
snitch and me and John were so tight from that point on so that's one way to do it is to just

07:51.840 --> 07:56.560
keep your cool about this owl and you know maybe they'll apologize no blood drawn which first of

07:56.560 --> 08:04.160
all good scalp you got there holy shit tough one yeah if this but like if this owl had wanted to

08:04.160 --> 08:09.600
fuck you up oh yeah you'd be fucked up yeah this was this is the owl sending a message here's where

08:09.600 --> 08:15.200
you've already ruined it you've already botched this as bad as you possibly can if an owl does

08:15.200 --> 08:23.360
this you have to owl tax your scalp spin around in one smooth motion and punch it in the face

08:23.920 --> 08:30.000
and then it's like dominance respect hey yeah it'll give you this kind of like okay look all

08:30.000 --> 08:36.560
right get it I see what's happening you and I respect and then you fight and if you beat it

08:36.560 --> 08:42.880
it's not ready to go out into it is not rehabilitated yet that is a good it's a good

08:42.880 --> 08:48.640
question like wildlife rehabilitation it doesn't mention rehabilitation for what

08:48.640 --> 08:53.680
so maybe this is always a bad seed counter owl and it's just acting out it's a behavioral

08:53.680 --> 08:58.480
rehabilitation yes it's got a problem with authority it's got dissociative personality

08:58.480 --> 09:04.480
disorder it's got some antisocial tendencies and it just uh it just doesn't like people that much

09:04.480 --> 09:09.840
let's just say like hey I'm not fine I may seem fine I put on a brave face I'm still kind of

09:09.840 --> 09:13.840
kind of messed up I need to chill here for a little bit longer listen can I tell you something

09:13.840 --> 09:21.760
question asker owl attacked human that seems pretty normal to me actually yeah that's it

09:21.760 --> 09:26.000
I think it'll be weirder if you walked in there and like the owl like waved at you happy to see

09:26.000 --> 09:31.280
you the owl's not ready to go back out there like that owl attacks you that owl is ready to be on

09:31.280 --> 09:36.080
its own that you should go back in like hey the owl attacked me and they'd be like oh that's good

09:36.080 --> 09:42.960
news that's so cool hey that owl's fucking fine yeah let it go it's fine it's doing what owls do

09:42.960 --> 09:48.800
I think the Japanese owl cafes got all the nice owls already and there's none left for the rest

09:48.800 --> 09:55.200
of us let's make room for a timid bird sure um I've got a yahoo here can I read it yeah please

09:55.200 --> 09:59.280
uh this one was sent in by level 9000 yahoo drew drew davenport thank you drew

09:59.280 --> 10:05.680
it's from yahoo answers user they're anonymous i'm gonna call them um uh no no no asks

10:06.720 --> 10:14.400
why don't scientists make military armor from bug shells yes bugs have hard shells that scientists

10:14.400 --> 10:19.680
can backwards engineer manufacture in their laboratories if you take a bug and you make

10:19.680 --> 10:24.240
the bug as large as a human or even bigger no gun would penetrate the shell also shells from

10:24.240 --> 10:31.360
bugs can be regenerated imagine having armor that can regenerate itself wait what say again

10:31.360 --> 10:37.280
shells there question asker shells from bugs can be regenerated imagine having armor that

10:37.280 --> 10:46.320
can regenerate itself okay so you went you went some ways that I used them to make material okay

10:46.320 --> 10:53.440
great engineer a bug as big as a human wait yeah wait whoa whoa whoa whoa this is a little old

10:53.440 --> 10:59.360
lady who swallowed a flycatcher the enemy army is beating us because their their new cool guns

10:59.360 --> 11:05.120
get through our get through our armor well I'm gonna take this uh this goliath beetle I'm gonna

11:05.120 --> 11:11.120
make it uh like way bigger than us and then I guess I'll try and take its skin and wear that

11:11.120 --> 11:16.480
yeah sounds like a good plan to me boop boop boop boop I've been gored by the goliath beetle

11:16.480 --> 11:25.600
and now it covered three minutes three minutes elapsed it was really bad you know I also I don't

11:25.600 --> 11:32.480
know listen I'm not a bug expert that should surprise no one but I'm pretty sure if you like

11:32.480 --> 11:39.440
peel bug armor off of it it's not like oh totally cool I'll just regrow that I'm pretty sure what

11:39.440 --> 11:46.960
you're talking about is like it's skin maybe I mean I can get skin back when it falls off sometimes

11:46.960 --> 11:52.320
so who knows how bugs do it um they're littler than me so I assume they can't they don't have

11:52.320 --> 12:00.480
all of my remarkable human powers um they can't drive but I can't but at the same time if I shoot

12:00.480 --> 12:07.520
a ladybug bullet bounce right off because it's very very powerful chitin and I guess what I'm

12:07.520 --> 12:13.360
wondering is how can I wear a big ladybug or why not just get a bunch of ladybugs and wear them

12:13.360 --> 12:20.240
all at the same time and now it's good yeah I'm alone three ladybug lady um hey that was the plot

12:20.240 --> 12:27.440
of the Rodney Dangerfield movie ladybugs yes what what human power would you trade away for chitin

12:27.440 --> 12:40.880
for chitinous plates hmm um you know maybe empathy wow yes good yes yes yes my my brother

12:40.880 --> 12:49.680
my brother and gyver this is a chitinous cyborg free of emotion um I would say jumping

12:49.680 --> 12:57.600
I just wouldn't be able to great point great point underused hardly using it for anything

12:57.600 --> 13:03.520
anymore if you think about it guys I I'm trying let me stop and think about the last time I

13:03.520 --> 13:11.680
jumped let me think about the last time that I I had cause to jump uh you think about that in like

13:11.680 --> 13:16.640
in like a lot of uh something like the heart like the from software games like the hardcore action

13:16.640 --> 13:26.240
games it's always note of it is made like you can't even jump like well so what yeah who still

13:26.240 --> 13:34.000
jumps I'm god guys I swear I'm trying to think of the last big jump I did and I just I have I have

13:34.000 --> 13:40.320
nothing I have nothing it must have been to get over a rock or something or to you know get the

13:40.320 --> 13:44.720
health potion I don't fucking remember the last time I jumped it may have been the last time I

13:44.720 --> 13:50.880
played basketball which is a long time ago just what about you what human power would you give away

13:52.400 --> 13:58.880
they're all so great they're all good gift I think it would be regrowing hair oh I think

13:58.880 --> 14:05.680
I would be okay with I to roll the dice I know I can't get any frosted tips that I later regret

14:06.400 --> 14:12.000
uh I guess I gotta always die it but no I get this one hair and that's it this is all the hair

14:12.000 --> 14:17.920
I have but I do have this incredible bulletproof chitin it lets me clean up the streets of Chicago

14:17.920 --> 14:22.960
you know what along now you've made me think because you said this one hair which made me

14:22.960 --> 14:28.960
think that instead of individual hairs you just have one adorable baby huey no but just more like

14:28.960 --> 14:36.160
your entire head of hair was one solid piece a coiled rope yes and I thought here's what I would

14:36.160 --> 14:43.440
go with um I would be willing to give up the space between my individual teeth to get bug

14:43.440 --> 14:49.040
armor I would have just one big top tooth and one big bottom tooth one horseshoe shaped tooth

14:49.680 --> 14:55.520
and I think I know amazing that actually might be more powerful than individual teeth now that I

14:55.520 --> 15:04.000
think about it violated the spirit of the game then yeah I was at my coworker's birthday we're

15:04.000 --> 15:11.280
not super close but it's civil holy shit okay I uh want to stab them quite bad yeah I'd like to

15:11.280 --> 15:17.840
stab them but don't that's what civil means if it weren't for your human laws yes I gave her

15:17.840 --> 15:23.040
a birthday card I keep in my glove box for emergencies that's some next level shit I hope

15:23.040 --> 15:28.640
you mean emergency birthdays not just like oh no flat tire use it use it to stop the bleeding

15:28.640 --> 15:34.320
it had love you lots on the front and gold letters I didn't think it was weird I just thought the

15:34.320 --> 15:41.280
design was pretty when she read the front she said whoa I didn't know you felt that way really

15:41.280 --> 15:48.960
stepping up this relationship how do I live in this atmosphere I've created that's from

15:48.960 --> 15:54.080
platonic proposal in Chicago well congrats on realizing that this is completely your fuck up

15:54.080 --> 15:59.920
this is completely your fuck up yeah this is like if you're gonna get an emergency card it

15:59.920 --> 16:06.000
needs to say something like celebrate like just like I don't even think you want to go specific

16:06.000 --> 16:12.400
as birthday now it's like celebrate and the side it's like this is a day yes or it just says

16:12.400 --> 16:25.200
occasion exclamation point it's now the time is now for this day sorry thank you and congratulations

16:26.080 --> 16:33.360
this day is here and you are here too you've made it to this day maybe more it could also

16:33.360 --> 16:38.080
just be a sort of innocuous compliment like a picture of a dinosaur and on the inside it says

16:38.080 --> 16:43.520
like I think you're a dino might and then they open that and read it and they're like oh it's

16:43.520 --> 16:48.560
cool that's too much oh okay do you know how many times I've been at somebody's birthday and

16:48.560 --> 16:52.320
I realized like oh I didn't get them anything I really should get through anything and then I'll

16:52.320 --> 16:57.360
like sit there on my phone and send them an iTunes gift card from my phone yeah and then get the eye

16:57.360 --> 17:01.520

what you're worth to me yeah here's the exact dollar value that you are that I value you this

17:33.440 --> 17:38.080
is that could have gone 20 listen to technology today there should be an option when you purchase

17:38.080 --> 17:43.360
like a gift card online for someone to backdate it like they'll just wedge it in in their gmail

17:43.360 --> 17:48.720

listening you're welcome yeah but if we do that what the fuck are we all doing here on earth as

18:00.720 --> 18:08.240
part of this one sort of beautiful consciousness if we can trick each other with time time traveling

18:08.800 --> 18:15.680
birthday cards I'm sorry I got rid of my empathy in exchange for this shit and you got me that

18:16.240 --> 18:21.840
you got me that empathy polish and I got you that chitin polish but I don't know how ironic

18:21.840 --> 18:26.400
well I can use the chitin polish I just can't uh jump to get it where you put it on the high

18:26.400 --> 18:32.880
shelf put it on the high shelf that was my fault it was I uh uh I'm recording this on

18:32.880 --> 18:38.640
Sydney's birthday and Charlie asked uh my my four-year-old daughter asked uh what I got

18:38.640 --> 18:44.160
Sydney so I showed her this gift certificate that I got and it was really more of a this is like one

18:44.160 --> 18:52.560
of the things they email you I got her as I sponsored a um a baby incubator for like a

18:52.560 --> 18:56.560
nation in crisis where they don't have access to medical care and I thought well that would be a

18:56.560 --> 19:00.800
lovely gift my wife would really appreciate that and I'm I'm showing this it's got a picture of

19:00.800 --> 19:04.560
the baby incubator and everything on the thing I'm showing this on the chair and explaining it to her

19:04.560 --> 19:08.480
and I finished this whole explanation and she took like three beats and said

19:09.280 --> 19:17.680
why would she want this like well sweetie she doesn't she doesn't she she's not gonna she said

19:17.680 --> 19:24.480
mommy doesn't even have a baby she won't like this like okay but it's a gift but it's her birthday

19:24.480 --> 19:30.240
I know okay fine sorry you didn't even have to finish that story I could have told you

19:30.240 --> 19:35.440
how it panned out when you explained to your four-year-old I got mommy a something she won't

19:35.440 --> 19:44.320
be able to touch and bright something she won't use like cool that sucks dad yeah it sucks check

19:44.320 --> 19:49.440
out this this uh this ceramic jimmy buffett parrot that I got her at hallmark this is a gift

19:49.440 --> 19:55.440
I got her this bag of slime that I made her yeah um so this is the longest we've ever gone without

19:55.440 --> 20:00.480
actually talking about the question because I think that that is the that is the severity of

20:00.480 --> 20:06.640
this mistake you've made um terrible mistake terrible mistake but mistake feels the term

20:06.640 --> 20:12.800
mistake almost feels like it um suggests an accident happened you can't look at the card that

20:12.800 --> 20:20.880
says uh I what was it love you lots and thank you lots you know what that you know love is subjective

20:20.880 --> 20:26.320
yes but we all sort of have a kind of agreement on what it means and then lots lots as a modifier

20:26.320 --> 20:33.120
as if to say a great deal of love I possess for you and you gave this to somebody who is not true

20:33.120 --> 20:38.400
for I will argue though that it's not like this the the front of the card said I must tell you

20:38.400 --> 20:44.160
about my deep and very real feelings for you it's said in gold letters love you lots a thing one

20:44.160 --> 20:52.960
might write in somebody's yearbook so no no no no I would say that maybe like us love you like a

20:52.960 --> 20:59.440
sister that's exactly that one's to be forgotten yes yeah I would say that have a course on this

20:59.440 --> 21:06.320
blame yes part of this blame does fall on the co-worker who looked at a greeting card since

21:06.320 --> 21:11.440
we purchased at a store that you handed them and thought this is a declaration of true emotion

21:12.000 --> 21:17.440
I think no one should ever think when they look at a greeting card what's anything greeting cards

21:17.440 --> 21:22.640
are man can we just talk about them for a second I hope you've got your finger on that fucking

21:22.640 --> 21:28.560
Seinfeld button yeah light them up just light them up dude get this to get this uh get this

21:28.560 --> 21:33.280
whole industry that's existed for thousands of years and it's definitely been the the butt of

21:33.280 --> 21:37.680
many many stand-up routines they're the worst and I always get them because it feels like we

21:37.680 --> 21:42.800
have to and sometimes they're nice but it just seems like hey you're right let's go to fucking

21:42.800 --> 21:51.200
a hack hit it no okay you're right I earned this now sit in that stew in that shit stew in it and

21:51.200 --> 21:56.480
think about what you've done sorry you're right that's both for the question asker and for Justin

21:56.480 --> 22:04.480
yeah we all we've all made some mistakes here yeah um you want another yahoo okay no we didn't

22:04.480 --> 22:09.200
give any sort of help like I want to send them get them on a card the next day that just says

22:09.200 --> 22:17.920
like no I don't no I don't I think you I think you need to okay you said it's been civil with

22:17.920 --> 22:25.360
this person you're not really close fine I think you need to the relationship is now at a different

22:25.360 --> 22:31.120
level right it's obviously been escalated to a different kind of relationship I think you need

22:31.120 --> 22:38.320
to see how long you can sort of maintain that level of relationship and maybe the like uh

22:39.280 --> 22:44.000
nothing gold can stay perhaps the relationship will fade in time and you'll revert to this sort

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
of like civil thing the but the but possibly a dear friend has been made this is the moment

22:50.000 --> 22:56.240
some sliding doors have a dear friend walk yes walk through the sliding doors thank you Travis

22:56.240 --> 23:03.040
yes that is my official TM advice is I think give it a whirl just see if you can maintain it

23:03.040 --> 23:08.240
you didn't plan to be here but now you're here it's like you know you got on the wrong home alone

23:08.240 --> 23:13.840
plane and you ended up in New York instead of uh Florida or whatever and you know what maybe have

23:13.840 --> 23:21.840
some fun in Florida remind you though that isn't what happened this person got on a plane that was

23:21.840 --> 23:26.400
labeled get on this plane to go to Paris without your son Kevin and then they were like that

23:26.400 --> 23:31.360
sounds good I'll try it and then they got on the plane and landed and was like Kevin it's like well

23:31.360 --> 23:36.560
no you remember you saw the planes but it was labeled what what then what you are suggesting

23:36.560 --> 23:41.040
Justin is they have arrived and said oh wait right Kevin's my son and I left him at home

23:41.040 --> 23:47.760
oh well I better have somebody pay as well I can yeah that's fair yeah mine's mine not that hopefully

23:48.640 --> 23:54.240
your scenario Justin makes it sound like Kevin McAllister is the victim in the home alone films

23:54.240 --> 23:59.600
when I would argue that that is true of everyone else in his family but not Kevin McAllister

24:01.920 --> 24:06.720
yes that's how that yes I want to die on that hill that's how you feel I just decided Kevin's

24:06.720 --> 24:11.600
not the victim here it is the rest of the family not not the eight-year-old boy left home alone

24:11.600 --> 24:16.240
because his family hated him and forgot about him well hate is a strong word don't you think

24:16.240 --> 24:22.640
he's just uh being a little pervert uh to his uncle and so he doesn't get woken up for this

24:22.640 --> 24:28.240
plane ride it's I think a lot of it is perspective we showed Charlie that movie for the first time

24:28.240 --> 24:34.160
about a year ago and she was I mean for her it's a horror movie right for a year for for months

24:34.160 --> 24:39.520
afterwards she talked about they left him alone which is the name of the film from her perspective

24:39.520 --> 24:44.400
was they left him alone with the name of that film yeah but me I'm a father too watching this

24:44.400 --> 24:49.920
is as a 38 year old father of two people I watch it from Catherine Harris perspective and think

24:50.960 --> 24:57.840
yeah I get it you know I get it you just want to relax your kid has zero chill you just want to

24:57.840 --> 25:02.240
relax in Paris for a little while you know they don't talk about all the time that Catherine

25:02.240 --> 25:10.400
Harris gets to sit in fucking silence you know a day like at least a good 24 hours I'll just be

25:10.400 --> 25:17.840
able to sit in fucking silence flight there and like a 14-hour flight back where yes she must have

25:17.840 --> 25:22.720
gotten on the plane right on the return and be like I feel so terrible but you can only maintain

25:22.720 --> 25:29.760
that feeling for so long before then they bring you like the warm nuts and like yeah okay I

25:29.760 --> 25:35.600
actually haven't seen a movie in three years do you have movies on this flight I mean I do feel

25:35.600 --> 25:40.400
terrible but I've been meaning to see if Greatest Showman was a hit or miss miss my boy I hope the

25:40.400 --> 25:47.200
sticky men aren't gonna get him but um can I take a airplane wine nap now please oh the seats are

25:47.200 --> 25:54.080
clawing all the way well that's nice Kevin would want me to check that out all right yeah that's

25:54.080 --> 25:59.680
that we're the polka boys that's nice anyone holding is anybody holding I haven't smoked weed

25:59.680 --> 26:05.120
since 1977 so this is probably fine yeah that's the only unrealistic thing is this motherfucker

26:05.120 --> 26:09.600
started playing tuba and she doesn't bury a shiv in one of their throats like please this is my

26:09.600 --> 26:15.600
moment just let me be why do we talk about home alone so much it's a touchstone apparently a

26:15.600 --> 26:21.200
cultural touchstone I would say we do talk about it a lot um okay I have a yahoo here can we talk

26:21.200 --> 26:24.480
about it okay it's sent by a few yeah we'll talk about that half as much as we talk about home

26:24.480 --> 26:29.760
alone yes thank you uh everybody who sent this one and it's yahoo answers user fritz who asks

26:30.560 --> 26:37.440
how did king triton get so buff yeah right he lived underwater where there's no resistance

26:37.440 --> 26:42.960
how could he get so buff I'm not sure that your terminology is right here because I think water

26:42.960 --> 26:49.760
is all resistance if that's the logic that you're using then uh mer folks who live in the water

26:49.760 --> 26:54.000
would be getting jacked from all the swimming that they do because that's exercise false that's just

26:54.000 --> 27:02.000
exercise I would say probably first heavy diet of plankton okay so he yeah okay so he has a sort

27:02.000 --> 27:09.040
of he has a webbing in his mouth and we don't see that but when he does extend his jaws wide open

27:09.040 --> 27:13.920
you see the webbing get in there and he does swallow up a million things and you know they're

27:13.920 --> 27:20.880
trying to play the the xylophone or whatever and then they did get eaten that would be rad if she

27:20.880 --> 27:25.840
walked on land for the first time with her human legs and she just collapsed like oh my bones my

27:25.840 --> 27:30.400
terrible weakened bones oh she just collapsed because her gills were dried out she's like I

27:30.400 --> 27:37.440
don't have lungs um but how to get so jacked up though he's very strong I don't know if you guys

27:37.440 --> 27:44.880
remember the movie but he has a very strong upper body I mean probably magic right like

27:45.680 --> 27:54.000
it's a very magical culture well that's true I feel like that's kind of a bullshit answer though

27:54.000 --> 28:00.320
trav like just magic that doesn't really okay he works out 24 seven he's spotted by sebastian is

28:00.320 --> 28:04.640
that what you want to hear swimming around is gonna get you a good tail yeah like everyone's

28:04.640 --> 28:10.240
gonna have a good tail I know you've but like usually their arms are just like gracefully

28:10.240 --> 28:17.200
behind them as they zip along you don't see a lot of like ripped jack huge chested dolphins

28:17.200 --> 28:22.320
yeah exactly well what you just said is wrong they're all the fucking muscle man the dolphins

28:22.320 --> 28:26.720
are all fuck muscle I do not know if you ever touched one of these bad boys but it is basically

28:26.720 --> 28:33.360
yes but they don't have definition griffin yes they've got the muscle mass yeah where's the

28:33.360 --> 28:38.160
definition the dolphin doesn't have a six-pack maybe anytime king trends on the screen he's

28:38.160 --> 28:44.160
lifting sea rocks he's just goes to his cave and there's not a lot to do down there that's what it

28:44.160 --> 28:48.400
is he has one of those grottos where it's like you can swim and it's like even though it's

28:48.400 --> 28:53.200
underwater it's almost like sea lab right where it's like pressurized so he can just like lift

28:53.200 --> 28:59.600
the top half of his body out pump some iron and then go back to swimming what if every merfolk

28:59.600 --> 29:04.880
or maybe it's just people who are sort of higher up the uh the the ladder uh people who in the

29:04.880 --> 29:12.000
royal family perhaps or uh people living in sort of the royal domain have this and it is your own

29:12.000 --> 29:18.880
personal fighting octopus and it's an octopus that you and uh you you fight and so every time you see

29:18.880 --> 29:25.920
him go off stage from the play of the movie uh he blows up all his daughter's stuff and then is like

29:25.920 --> 29:31.920
i'm a good dad and then he swims away and then you know while ariel's having a sad time in there with

29:31.920 --> 29:37.680
all her broken tchotchkes uh he's like i i feel so bad about what i've done to my daughter's

29:37.680 --> 29:41.600
collectibles and figurines ah fuck it get over here

29:46.800 --> 29:53.280
oh no fight no tridents no tridents you're right you're right that's my god come here sorry sorry

29:53.280 --> 30:00.400
sorry i uh i do love this idea that he has a secret rock gym somewhere though the the as i

30:00.400 --> 30:06.960
i'll think of it the grotto of gains where he just goes and car carves himself out aqua man's too

30:06.960 --> 30:12.720
yeah it's him man in there you know aqua man has secret rocks and octopus that he fights

30:13.600 --> 30:19.440
he blasted up his daughter's collectibles because he's a real jackass scene is wild in it it's

30:19.440 --> 30:23.760
actually batman he shows up at batman's house and batman sing a song about all of his great

30:23.760 --> 30:28.320
tools and where did all my cool stuff i built with all my money where do you get all these

30:28.320 --> 30:35.200
wonderful toys zap zap zap oh he uses his magic trident what a good flick i mean i've been a dad

30:35.200 --> 30:40.240
for only two years now and tridents got like eight daughters and they all appear to be like

30:40.240 --> 30:46.560
you know teenage to older so he's been a dad for a while now what a fucking rookie mistake

30:46.560 --> 30:52.800
you'd be like i know a cool dad move blast up all the shit she cares about yeah of course

30:52.800 --> 30:59.200
she went to the sea witch you dumb ass you drove her right into ursula's arms you piece of shit

30:59.200 --> 31:04.400
it'd be cool if if aquaman came down and because he's the king of fish he like made triton clean

31:04.400 --> 31:12.480
it all up you fix this hey fix it fix it you fucked up dad fucking asshole yeah triton should

31:12.480 --> 31:18.560
have immediately come back i'm like you know what that was on me um i'm gonna fix this statue

31:18.560 --> 31:24.240
i need to find some waterproof super glue and then i will fix this i think he just said everybody

31:24.240 --> 31:30.640
else hey everybody go find more trash go get more trash for my kid maybe to find another statue that

31:30.640 --> 31:35.200
fell off a boat yeah the way that this would actually play out is aqua would be like clean

31:35.200 --> 31:39.520
this up you're a bad dad and then up half would be like no get the fuck out of here what are you

31:39.520 --> 31:45.520
but then his butt would be like oh you're right you're right let me let me slap it around with

31:45.520 --> 31:50.640
my is this helping no it's a clock you can't just slap it with your weird fish tail and fix it you

31:50.640 --> 31:59.120

32:10.640 --> 32:17.280
matted that's full of i don't know probably like bacteria maybe that's where he absorbs food from

32:17.280 --> 32:22.640
that's where he harvests guaranteed where's the scene of all the little fish that followed triton

32:22.640 --> 32:29.360
around just picking bacteria and algae out of his beard that's it's got to be hard to get much

32:29.360 --> 32:34.720

this isn't the munch squad i'm just mentioning now i'll be able to try the duncan offerings first

38:34.960 --> 38:39.440
hand you don't do you don't do that with the garbage that you bring here for the show right

38:39.440 --> 38:42.960
now you're not you're not actually like experimenting firsthand with these things

38:42.960 --> 38:50.960
right sometimes sometimes the picture looks good oh um and i want to try it and i probably would

38:50.960 --> 38:56.240
have tried it anyway i get excited listen my ride got ride got bought out by walgreens

38:56.240 --> 39:01.040
and i'm the idiot that walked in after they did their remodel and is like commenting to the

39:01.040 --> 39:06.240
employees like god it's really bright in here it looks great this is so spacious don't you love

39:06.240 --> 39:12.640
this i'm loving this you guys loving this this is not an exaggeration that i did that uh so duncan

39:12.640 --> 39:19.680
has launched peeps coffee and a peeps donut for spring okay peep flavor is starting to get into

39:19.680 --> 39:26.800
get into things there's peeps creamer now i got and peeps cereal and peeps don't have a flavor

39:26.800 --> 39:34.080
folks it's marshmallows with sugar on it folks and marshmallow really is puffed sugar so we're just

39:34.080 --> 39:40.080
kind of talking about sugar mostly folks yeah you're telling me that you've made sugar flavored

39:40.080 --> 39:47.440
creamer that's right and it doesn't taste like anything except sugar and now that's in a coffee

39:47.440 --> 39:54.320
and a donut it's peeps marshmallow flavor coffee and espresso drinks and the peeps donut is topped

39:54.320 --> 39:59.520
with an iconic yellow chick that's right folks they just put a chick on the donut one right on

39:59.520 --> 40:04.880
there and the shelf life of these bad boys after you remove them from the packaging is about nine

40:04.880 --> 40:12.160
seconds before they turn crunchy and inedible so are they doing these things to order because that

40:12.160 --> 40:19.120
would be kind of wild uh yeah they're they're just slapped they're opening up a discrete package

40:19.840 --> 40:28.080
uh as you as you uh pull up and uh slapping it on there so you can just enjoy a donut with a peep

40:28.080 --> 40:34.480
on it um now because i did pick this so quickly there's not really anything funny about this one

40:34.480 --> 40:38.640
because i was just trying to get you to stop talking about the dirty stuff so there's not

40:38.640 --> 40:43.040
really anything good well hold on let's find let's find the i had a joke earlier i didn't

40:43.040 --> 40:46.960
really have time to do but maybe it could make it funny when you just say that like a sugar

40:46.960 --> 40:52.160
flavored creamer again so they did that oh so they made sugar flavored creamer sugar creamer

40:53.280 --> 41:01.120
okay all right sugar and then you put it in the creamer okay carls here that was a much quad jr

41:01.120 --> 41:06.400
then carls jr and i have one hold on hold on okay did you have one you want to do you want to get

41:06.400 --> 41:10.640
a handle i want to kind of piggyback off of what griffin said and this is kind of an alley out to

41:10.640 --> 41:16.480
justin okay please see where i'm going with this sugar creamer more like sugar creamer

41:19.360 --> 41:23.120
sugar sugar creamer i hardly sugar new know her

41:26.880 --> 41:33.440
that was the three-pointer that's what you got for that uh the real quick note carls jr added a bacon

41:33.440 --> 41:40.640
truffle burger and a bacon truffle cheese fries this image is not gonna drive me anywhere except

41:40.640 --> 41:46.240
out of my fucking mind this is this is a horrid thing that you should seek out and see for yourself

41:46.240 --> 41:51.600
i'm gonna link you guys just so you can see in the chat there you can see the image of the burger

41:51.600 --> 41:58.480
that's a tall one that is it's just layers upon layers of horrid and it's a menu innovation they

41:58.480 --> 42:06.080
call it here with no trace of irony it features a decadent truffle infused white cheddar sauce

42:06.080 --> 42:13.520
which has a deep rich and savory flavor including notes of garlic toasted onion and egg parmesan

42:14.240 --> 42:20.640
the burger includes a charbroiled 100 black angus beef patty topped with premium white

42:20.640 --> 42:28.240
cheddar truffle sauce two slices of applewood smoked bacon crispy onion straws swiss cheese

42:28.240 --> 42:34.240
caramelized onions fucking they made this they made that they made that okay and then at the end

42:34.240 --> 42:41.760
they were like and mayonnaise and then yes mayonnaise good on this thing here's a quote

42:41.760 --> 42:48.960
about this crime the launch of our new bacon truffle angus burger connects back to our dedication

42:48.960 --> 42:56.320
to introducing bold craveable and unexpected flavors to our menu in interesting ways this guy

42:56.320 --> 43:00.880
had to come up with it i think they like ran into his office like we already started recording

43:00.880 --> 43:06.160
quick say something about the black angus truffle burger it um connects back to our dedication

43:06.160 --> 43:11.840
to introducing bold craveable and unexpected flavors in interesting ways you already said

43:11.840 --> 43:17.120
unexpected yeah i know but i'm just making it up as a go truffle is traditionally viewed as a rare

43:17.120 --> 43:25.120
indulgence and we're bringing it to the everyday dining experience do you do you trust us hardies

43:25.120 --> 43:30.400
with that and we're we are hardies don't forget we have a different name but we're still hardies

43:30.400 --> 43:36.400
but anyway do you want this fancy forest mushroom that a pig dug up i i want to meet the bruce who's

43:36.400 --> 43:42.400

43:42.400 --> 43:48.640

44:14.560 --> 44:19.840
my god my god my god now we've done it again now we're all sons of bitches

44:37.600 --> 44:43.200
on it and you are going to take the word elegant and just jam it up your ass like there's no me

44:43.200 --> 44:48.560
there's no meaning behind anything anymore yeah this bad boy this is a this looks like a wet

44:48.560 --> 44:54.240
agro crag that i have to climb and eat from the top down this is a big big mound of it's a

44:54.240 --> 45:01.600
challenging challenging fight challenging sandwich a challenging burger anyway that's all there is

45:01.600 --> 45:07.040
to know about that that carl's junior now it doesn't mention specifically hardies so i don't

45:07.040 --> 45:12.560
know if they're leaving hardies out in the cold on this one this may just be a carl junior ridge

45:12.560 --> 45:18.400
our hardies would never serve a burger like this how about another question please i recently

45:18.400 --> 45:23.760
started working in an office setting i only work there three days a week and i am a graduate student

45:23.760 --> 45:29.440
so i'm not close with the full-time staff there's a small basket of candy that sits near the

45:29.440 --> 45:34.720
secretary and i pass it every day on my way in i grab a few pieces throughout the day my question

45:34.720 --> 45:41.280
is how many pieces is too many i feel bad taking too many as i'm not full-time staff and also as a

45:41.280 --> 45:46.640
grad student it's hard to pass on free candy do i cut back on the candy do i just sneakily take

45:46.640 --> 45:51.520
more at one time do i create a diversion to draw the secretary's attention so they at least know

45:51.520 --> 45:56.640
it's not me depleting the resources and that's morgan i mean when you get to the point where

45:56.640 --> 46:01.680
you're doing a little heist every time you get the candy i think you know it's too much candy

46:01.680 --> 46:10.640
at that point am i wrong in my feeling about the candy at the front desk that's for visitors right

46:10.640 --> 46:16.800
is that isn't that visitor candy as a way of saying like welcome here this isn't for the staff

46:16.800 --> 46:22.000
this is for you our visitor please enjoy a tootsie roll i always thought if somebody puts out a bowl

46:22.000 --> 46:28.480
of candy that's like the basic human way of signaling like i'm someone who likes interaction

46:29.200 --> 46:35.680
this reminds me of the funny office uh the office episode american version of course

46:35.680 --> 46:45.360
yes the original um and it the the scene where pam puts out all the candy uh and then dwight walks

46:45.360 --> 46:51.520
up and he's gonna have a piece of candy and he puts his hand in the bowl and he starts to unwrap

46:51.520 --> 46:58.400
it and then uh jim jumps up from behind the plant and gives him a good scare and he swallows it and

46:58.400 --> 47:06.400
chokes on it no no he gets it out no but yeah i'm like it it's fine all right but he does pee himself

47:06.400 --> 47:14.960
yeah so did we help i think let me let me i will uh take this way off your shoulders the like that

47:14.960 --> 47:19.760
you're taking too many because you're not full time i think that's okay i think i don't think

47:19.760 --> 47:25.280
anyone's like hey you only work 20 hours a week that's worth two pieces of candy the president

47:25.280 --> 47:30.560
and the company doesn't walk in and just up in the bowl into their mouth and then say i earned this

47:31.280 --> 47:37.600
this is mine this is my put in the hours and became the the the bar so this one listen to

47:37.600 --> 47:43.440
the real answer and i hate to give real advice here it feels weird but you could offer to buy

47:43.440 --> 47:48.080
the next bag of candy you could just do that but that would defeat the purpose if this person knew

47:48.080 --> 47:54.560
how to buy candy we wouldn't be in this mess right okay have you heard of stores listen people put

47:54.560 --> 48:00.480
out candy on their desks at work so for conversation starters i think it's a it's a it's the water

48:00.480 --> 48:07.280
cooler come talk to me about lost still because it's all i think about and uh that's why i put

48:07.280 --> 48:16.160
this thing on and oh uh tuesday's right with mori have you read it book club this week on tuesday

48:16.160 --> 48:21.840
weirdly enough so get there yes there will be candy there will be candy some good and uh so

48:21.840 --> 48:27.360
nobody read the book again i see um but i do notice that the worthers are gone um that is

48:27.360 --> 48:33.600

48:33.600 --> 48:41.600

48:41.600 --> 48:47.200
out of him and gives him lessons and um you're all leaving because the worthers are see it okay

48:47.200 --> 48:52.560
it's visitor candy i'm gonna stick by my guns visitor candy uh my dad i've got another can

48:52.560 --> 48:58.320
do another one yes okay dear brothers i recently started working in a pasta factory on the ravioli

48:58.320 --> 49:03.360
line this job would be perfect for me except for one thing i can't stop thinking about eating the

49:03.360 --> 49:10.960
uncooked raviolis as they as they move past me the worst is but i have to stand there on the

49:10.960 --> 49:17.280
the worst is but i have to stand there on the line and make sure no defective one gets passed i've

49:17.280 --> 49:22.400
come so close to stuffing my pockets and getting the hell out of that sinner's paradise i can't

49:22.400 --> 49:29.440
see goodbye arrow shortly because please tell me how to sedate the ravioli monster inside of me or

49:29.440 --> 49:45.040
fill that's from randy for ravioli thank you so much it's on it's i just i want to just hit one

49:45.040 --> 49:51.200
thing that it's an uncooked but i do understand that after a certain point of watching them roll

49:51.200 --> 49:56.160
by that probably like fades to the back of your mind and you're just like but now i just want to

49:56.160 --> 50:02.480
like yeah i know it's not gonna be good i just want to eat what i wanted to compulsion doesn't

50:02.480 --> 50:08.320
have to make complete logical sense in fact oftentimes it does not although i will say

50:08.320 --> 50:14.560
as somebody who recently learned that they had been um horribly maligned by his two older brothers

50:14.560 --> 50:20.240
who he trusted very much into eating uncooked uh fettuccine every time we went to olive garden

50:20.240 --> 50:25.200
i do hope that i would have had the good sense not to eat uncooked ravioli because there's a lot of

50:25.200 --> 50:30.160
other sort of matter a lot of other sort of material floating around in that in that one

50:30.160 --> 50:36.720
the problem is if you eat it and anyone sees you won't i don't even know that you'd so much get in

50:36.720 --> 50:42.560
trouble for eating the product so much as everyone around you would be like what are you doing what

50:42.560 --> 50:47.680
are you doing that's not cooked it's not cooked the other problem would be if i am working on

50:47.680 --> 50:55.840
this line across from you and i saw you finally break and within one deft maneuver just shove

50:55.840 --> 51:02.560
even like a defective one into your mouth i am my first assumption will not be oh i'm i'm sure

51:02.560 --> 51:07.440
that's the first time they've done that it will be they have done this 400 times a day across from

51:07.440 --> 51:12.400
me and this is the first time i have ever noticed or worse what if you do it and everyone's like oh

51:12.400 --> 51:19.600
thank god someone did it first and then just the whole floor just to grab and go everyone's going

51:19.600 --> 51:25.200
crazy shoving those little circles in their mouths this is the new foot loose this is foot

51:25.200 --> 51:31.680
loose too but there's not any dancing and you're just just bowels loose you're the jeans wearing

51:31.680 --> 51:36.800
rebel who comes in and shows everybody it's okay to eat this uncooked ravioli we're supposed to be

51:36.800 --> 51:41.920
packaging wait but what do you do with the defective ones why can't you eat those here's

51:41.920 --> 51:48.000
how i would do when you get a defective one be like just yell lala like oh god no and then

51:48.000 --> 51:53.120
pick it up and throw it across the room but throw it in the same place every time and then at the

51:53.120 --> 51:59.360
end of the day go get a ziploc baggie and scoop up all your dirty floor all your dirty defective

51:59.360 --> 52:06.080
floor ravioli go have yourself a treat at home or oh hey bring a bag of uncooked ravioli from home

52:06.080 --> 52:10.080
have them put a sticker on it or something when you come in and when you get that craving just

52:10.080 --> 52:16.240
pop one of your own in there what if you went to your boss and you're like listen i have this

52:16.240 --> 52:21.280
problem and you describe the problem and it's like i would i don't want to steal things but i do want

52:21.280 --> 52:29.120
to eat the raviolis they're all pastry can i just keep a tally of the ones i've eaten and and just

52:29.120 --> 52:35.760
deducted my paycheck at the end or alternately i will pay you a hundred dollars now and we'll

52:35.760 --> 52:40.880
have a kind of budget that i can give into whatever i want it's like a gas station you're like i i

52:40.880 --> 52:45.200
have this problem i want to eat it and he's like just puts a finger to his lips and then goes up

52:45.200 --> 52:50.160
and like closes the blinds he's like come with me and opens and there's just like there's just a

52:50.160 --> 52:54.400
room full of uncooked ravioli like whenever you need to you can come in here and satiate your

52:54.400 --> 53:00.320
dark passenger wear this maybe they're waiting for some maybe the the boss is waiting for somebody to

53:00.320 --> 53:05.920
be like hey listen i can't do this anymore i fucking love these pillowy bad boys too much

53:05.920 --> 53:11.360
i can't work this job this close to him not even he and he's like finally i found special boy i'm

53:11.360 --> 53:16.640
going to give my factory to someone who loves to eat these delicious little bastards as much as i

53:16.640 --> 53:26.480
do the man who ate all the uncooked ravioli he wanted he shit himself it's not cooked it was

53:26.480 --> 53:33.280
really really quite yucky don't don't do that but here are the keys um to the building anyway

53:33.280 --> 53:38.320
get in this uh death box we're gonna fly up it's gonna be cool is there somebody you hate at work

53:38.320 --> 53:44.320
where you could like eat them and then if you get caught just like actually i saw jared jared was

53:44.320 --> 53:49.440
doing it and he i thought it was fine because jared is beloved here and i thought it was kind

53:49.440 --> 53:54.800
of a fine company policy to eat them for everyone i've eaten yeah it's true smell is nasty ricotta

53:54.800 --> 54:00.480
mouth and and like they open his locker and you've stuffed a bunch of uncooked ravioli do it

54:01.120 --> 54:05.520
it's really i mean i was just thinking why can't you just buy a box of this uncooked ravioli but

54:05.520 --> 54:12.480
it's not the same right like you want it you want it fresh out of mama's kitchen yeah but what you

54:12.480 --> 54:18.160
can do what you can do is while you're on the assembly line you have brought a box of say 16

54:18.160 --> 54:23.920
uncooked raviolis and then you dump them out onto the line and you real quick run further down the

54:23.920 --> 54:31.360
belt and scoop up 16 fresh from mama's kitchen ones and then no one is the wiser except for the

54:31.360 --> 54:36.560
fact this would be a very conspicuous thing to do maybe just whenever you go on break for lunch just

54:36.560 --> 54:40.560
say like okay i'm on break and once you clock out just lay down at the end of the conveyor

54:40.560 --> 54:45.680
belt and let them fall in your mouth you're on break they can't fire you no could you they can

54:45.680 --> 54:53.440
only arrest could you suggest to your bosses that you open the factory to the public and start doing

54:53.440 --> 55:01.920
tours and one of the the perks of the tour is at the end you get to pop of one of the sweet raviolis

55:01.920 --> 55:09.760
in your mouth no problem no questions asked uncooked and then when the tours open you take

55:09.760 --> 55:18.560
the day off show up in a fake mustache and go and you just keep doing disguises you do disguises

55:18.560 --> 55:24.880
where you can show up and take like hello my name is jim posterson and i have heard good things

55:24.880 --> 55:29.760
that's my favorite part of the louisville slugger tour is at the end where you get the unfinished

55:29.760 --> 55:35.440
bat and you're just allowed to smash it on the ground just blast it everybody gets one

55:35.440 --> 55:39.200
justin you mentioned disguises you don't even have to set up this whole plot about the tour

55:39.760 --> 55:46.480
you could just dress up in a big hairy suit and run in and start eating all the ravioli right off

55:46.480 --> 55:51.840
the belt and then everybody else there be like oh no the beast the beast is back the beast is back

55:51.840 --> 55:55.600
and they have to lock themselves in the safety room and start lighting the torches

55:57.120 --> 56:02.320
you might have to do a little groundwork beforehand and say like hey guys i was just

56:02.320 --> 56:07.840
outside uh getting something for my car and i saw a beast running around and that might take weeks

56:07.840 --> 56:11.520
to really establish the myth that you couldn't do it same day you couldn't like the morning

56:11.520 --> 56:16.560
i'll say the beast and come in the afternoon you'd have to spot it when no one else did just like hey

56:16.560 --> 56:21.440
did you guys see the i saw the beast okay but you're gonna have to you're gonna have to clear

56:21.440 --> 56:28.320
this with your boss first so go into your boss and he said um excuse me uh hello can i can i come in

56:28.320 --> 56:36.960
yes come in it's it's uh it's me fert um i had an idea for one thing that might make it good

56:36.960 --> 56:41.520
to work here make it make it better finally yes please i've been waiting for some kind of suggestion

56:41.520 --> 56:49.120
on what would make it good to work here please tell me it would be um citing if sometimes a

56:49.120 --> 56:56.080
werewolf showed up not a werewolf not a werewolf the beast please the beast oh thank you thank you

56:56.080 --> 57:00.640
other boss that's a much better suggestion i can see we're on the same page here please do not

57:00.640 --> 57:09.440
treat him with the same level of respect you can tell from my big diaper so um it might be a good

57:09.440 --> 57:14.240
thing sometimes it might make it fun exciting uh-huh um and now what would these bees do would

57:14.240 --> 57:21.280
he come in and do maybe a funny dance or wave some pom-poms around yeah sure whatever and then he

57:21.280 --> 57:27.920
would probably eat some of the ravioli like like coming with a big steaming plate of it that he had

57:27.920 --> 57:37.760
made at home boiling water that the baby boss that's the ball that's a great question no he

57:37.760 --> 57:42.480
would just come in and um he would just kind of he would just kind of eat him raw he just kind of

57:42.480 --> 57:48.240
eat him raw like a beast i do understand the connection but i don't know if that's uh i'll do

57:48.240 --> 57:55.040
