00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.280
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.360
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.280
I'm your sweet baby brother 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

00:55.280 --> 01:08.000
I got a soundboard yeah so that's gonna be a new thing that the ruins or maybe

01:08.880 --> 01:16.000
finalizes the sort of concept of this show okay you know people have said what what i wish

01:16.000 --> 01:21.600
i wish that my brother my brother and me was more like an early 2000s like morning drive

01:21.600 --> 01:30.320
to a radio show and we have the pest in there too now oh that's a lot of the pest i would love

01:30.320 --> 01:37.680
i would actually prefer these to be like short sort of uh yelps or barks and not extended clips

01:37.680 --> 01:42.640
of the past not the entirety of not the entirety of that you don't have a button map to the entirety

01:42.640 --> 01:49.200
of the pest i'm hoping okay okay so you do have a button map to the entirety of yeah that's the

01:49.200 --> 01:53.600
entirety of the pest just for that and what did you when you knew a newer program by the way

01:53.600 --> 01:59.120
special thanks to roman marsden and i'm pretending visible for sabotaging our show by showing justin

01:59.120 --> 02:06.080
how to do this um i'm assuming that's where you gleaned this particular yeah yeah when you were

02:06.080 --> 02:12.640
programming in your board and you put in the entirety of the pest intro the hit john leguizamo

02:13.200 --> 02:18.880
feature film um what did you think the use case for that was going to be like what did you think

02:18.880 --> 02:23.520
was going to be the time of the show like if we started talking about it and i could just like

02:23.520 --> 02:30.320
start playing it but then wow that's remember to stop playing it isn't it justin an order boris

02:30.320 --> 02:35.360
yeah where it's like you started playing it so that we would talk about the enter and then

02:35.360 --> 02:41.840
you're like oh the intro you mean this so it's kind of like a john leguizamo causal loop is what

02:41.840 --> 02:47.600
you've established now i did put inspired by you last night griffin i did put something on here

02:47.600 --> 02:52.640
that i kind of thought you would oh please talk about please i thought you would talk about it

02:53.600 --> 03:00.880
what okay do you want the intro or no intro just hit no no intro i put my hand inside a toilet

03:02.480 --> 03:04.960
oh thank you justin what

03:04.960 --> 03:20.640
yeah you you heard it maybe one more i put my hand inside a toilet oh it's so good what is this

03:20.640 --> 03:25.280
i mean this show is going to be please just explain i'm going to stop it now explain to

03:25.280 --> 03:29.360
travis what he's just heard i mean i don't think it's the kind of thing that plays just by hearing

03:29.360 --> 03:34.080
it but it made me personally very happy there's a company called brainpower media that makes a

03:34.080 --> 03:39.200
bunch of really great films as far as i can tell including best friend from heaven in which chris

03:39.200 --> 03:43.840
christopherson voices a dog who dies but then comes back from the dead to help his owners plan

03:43.840 --> 03:50.640
a wedding um and then there's a movie called a witch's ball in which a man gets on stage and

03:51.280 --> 03:58.480
sings a beautiful song about how he put his hand inside a toilet and so all of that is yeah like

03:58.480 --> 04:04.160
that like that what does it sound like because i was talking over i put my hand inside a toilet

04:04.160 --> 04:10.400
yes so that's the song i put me okay and then stop it because it's so loud it's very loud

04:11.440 --> 04:16.640
and uh this show's not going to be a thing people can consume for entertainment anymore

04:16.640 --> 04:23.280
i think maybe like it's becoming more avant-garde in a way which maybe more experimental yeah so

04:23.280 --> 04:27.360
maybe we'll get talked talked about on all the big art blogs every frame of painting is going

04:27.360 --> 04:32.640
to come out of retirement i don't know much about the beatles but this is probably like our revolver

04:32.640 --> 04:38.240
or our sergeant pepper period the macros have changed what it means to podcast because podcasting

04:38.240 --> 04:44.080
used to be a thing that people could enjoy yeah and it is yeah no the macroy brothers are

04:44.080 --> 04:50.000
challenging you to just try to enjoy their show just try it and it's a lot like revolver in that

04:50.000 --> 04:57.520
it feels like we are trying to shoot our listeners ears off with like a gun made of bad audio like a

04:57.520 --> 05:03.440
bad audio experience so a love gun made of bad audio just to tie back in the kiss connection

05:03.440 --> 05:10.000
so maybe we put the soundboard inside a toilet uh-huh okay and flush it down to sewer hell

05:10.000 --> 05:19.440
so we kind of want to do some old school my bim bam without the soundboard yeah we got a lot of

05:19.440 --> 05:28.000
stuff for you tonight you don't mind if we go way back to old school kids do you okay so there is

05:28.000 --> 05:32.160
some now i get and now i'm starting to turn around on the soundboard because there is some topical

05:32.160 --> 05:39.040
stuff on there so topical humor yeah okay i'm done well oh you must adjust in your elbow

05:39.040 --> 05:42.960
i brushed a button on there okay so i'm gonna need you to set the soundboard that was a lot of fart

05:42.960 --> 05:48.400
noise what's sad justin now we've used up all our whole fart noise budget i don't know how we're

05:48.400 --> 05:53.840
gonna get through a show yeah we actually have to dip into our 2018 fart noise budget uh so this is

05:53.840 --> 05:58.080
my brother my brother and me we it's advice show for the modern era uh we're kind of out of the

05:58.080 --> 06:05.440
advice thing and more sort of focused on this soundboard currently so uh but we're definitely

06:05.440 --> 06:09.680
gonna to help some people because that's what we're here before we started to think griffin

06:09.680 --> 06:17.760
did you want to share your you had an idea for the next year slogan that i really liked yes i got a

06:17.760 --> 06:25.760
letter in the mail uh and the letter in the mail had a suggestion for a slogan for 2018 and i wanted

06:25.760 --> 06:31.520
to pitch it here i feel good about enough about this one by the way that i am i'm almost ready

06:31.520 --> 06:36.400
to forego the usual pitch sesh we should talk about it we should you're right we should talk

06:36.400 --> 06:40.080
about it but it's something to stew on because i don't know if it's the healthiest i'm all about

06:40.080 --> 06:50.000
the health anyway uh landon and justin suggested 20 slates clean 20 slates clean and now let's

06:50.000 --> 06:55.840
talk about it because i worry the possessive i worry i'm not sure we need that 20 slate clean

06:55.840 --> 07:02.080
could be good i worry that people are going to think that we are there have been a lot of full

07:02.080 --> 07:08.480
blown creeps and freaks creepazoids and freakazoids been coming out of the woodworks this year

07:09.120 --> 07:17.680
and i don't want 20 slate clean to sound like we are um we are we are forgiving and forgetting

07:17.680 --> 07:24.640
in any way but i worry that people could interpret 20 slate clean to mean that i just ah yes

07:24.640 --> 07:31.680
i know our freakazoids we're still down we're so happy to have you on the show creepazoids

07:31.680 --> 07:37.600
you're right creepazoids to the back please you know what creepazoids please go ahead and go

07:37.600 --> 07:42.400
you can go ahead and go you're excused get the fuck out now freakazoids don't you move a muscle

07:42.400 --> 07:48.000
yeah because y'all are here y'all are here with us scoot up it's got that jam on it and it's got

07:48.000 --> 07:55.680
the nasty jam that you like freakazoids um but i think i'm also not sure about 20 slate clean

07:55.680 --> 08:04.480
because i don't know that i want to uh establish a motto that is as sort of centered around like

08:04.480 --> 08:10.480
boy this was a bad year next year's the one because i feel like maybe we thought 2016 was

08:10.480 --> 08:19.200
like oh boy well at least 2016's over and then 2017 was sort of a bad sequel in a way you know

08:19.200 --> 08:25.040
what i mean so i don't want to be like leave it behind i want it to be like fucking mount like

08:25.040 --> 08:33.440
regulators mount up what what's so messed up is that it turned out that 2017 what turned out to

08:33.440 --> 08:40.080
be 2013 dig it up yeah so like we just got the year off by like three years this year we dug

08:40.080 --> 08:45.120
up a lot of dirt we there's a lot of dirty dirt just when you thought you'd hit bedrock you'd

08:45.120 --> 08:50.640
hit it again and it was just more hard crumbly dirt yeah you thought it was bedrock but it was

08:50.640 --> 08:57.840
actually new kinds of terrible dirt just that hadn't even been invented yet so i like the

08:57.840 --> 09:02.880
phonetically 20 slate clean it sounds great i just don't know i i don't want to i'm not settled on

09:02.880 --> 09:08.480
it because i don't know that it's necessarily yeah i was taking it more of like a personal

09:08.480 --> 09:14.000
starting fresh you know not like forgive and forget but for yourself like allow yourself

09:14.000 --> 09:21.760
this period of phoenix like but that's a good year titled should not need a uh a parenthetical

09:21.760 --> 09:29.520
yeah all of us have had parenthetical and also 20 serpentine zag on them uh that was a sub

09:29.520 --> 09:37.200
2013 dig it up like that was a subtitle to him to increase the power of it not to codify

09:37.200 --> 09:42.960
that it doesn't apply it also i don't want a fresh start for everybody because i feel like

09:42.960 --> 09:50.400
if one good thing came out of 2017 is that we got fucking hard like we got you you had to get

09:50.400 --> 09:56.240
hard to get through 2017 and i'm not i'm not ready to get i it would be bad for us to give

09:56.240 --> 10:02.320
up that chitin that we've developed after the waves of fucking garbage have crashed against our

10:02.320 --> 10:09.040
shores for you know two calendar years now i i i feel like tough something about like

10:09.840 --> 10:16.320
just fucking polish that armor we need a rhyme that rhymes with like something that represents

10:16.320 --> 10:24.400
no surrender like 20 20 20 blade 20 blade teen and it's just like get

10:26.080 --> 10:31.520
strapped with a big sharp sword maybe this is maybe this is the year that we all become

10:31.520 --> 10:36.880
sword people listen we got another we're still in the candlelight spirit we do not we have plenty

10:36.880 --> 10:40.400
of time to think about what the theme for next year is going to be true true there's probably

10:40.400 --> 10:46.160
something with skating we just have to figure it out um skating uh but uh right now we're

10:46.160 --> 10:51.440
going to get into the questions uh and i have to use the bathroom over here oh well how are we

10:51.440 --> 10:55.760
going to do the questions if and could you at least press some buttons on the soundboard to

10:55.760 --> 11:03.520
uh he's gone on griffin we should just uh pitch other like subtitles and let people come up with

11:03.520 --> 11:12.560
the rhymes for us like i like mount up mount up if we mount up makes me psyched right if we can

11:12.560 --> 11:18.640
find some kind of rhyme that's like 20 something something mount up 20 plate teen and it's like

11:18.640 --> 11:30.240
plate armor this is nothing no 20 let's go to rhymezone.com yes checkmate team checkmate teen

11:30.240 --> 11:39.520
no doesn't it doesn't quite go 20 weight teen be poised to strike 20 weight teen 20 weight teen

11:39.520 --> 11:46.000
poised to strike oh i like that and it just means like keep your fucking head on the swivel

11:46.000 --> 11:54.800
mount up mm-hmm what about 20 don't weight teen and it's like no day but today 20 weight teen

11:54.800 --> 12:03.840
don't wait for you for your chance to to strike um what about have you guys done 20 freight teen

12:03.840 --> 12:10.880
unstoppable like a freight like a freight train let's do some questions so a few days ago right

12:10.880 --> 12:16.480
after my parents had gotten home from what i don't know we're in media res uh two guys in a

12:16.480 --> 12:23.360
truck drove to up to our house and asked us if our neighbors christmas lights were public i didn't

12:23.360 --> 12:28.560
think much of it at first but my mother's convinced this is a tactic they were using to scout our

12:28.560 --> 12:36.080
house after thinking about it i myself also now believe we are going to be burgled are we that's

12:36.080 --> 12:46.800
from worried in west virginia what on god's green earth does that mean okay so as i understand that

12:46.800 --> 12:55.520
okay so this is based on my uh annual watching of um the american scream which is the the movie

12:55.520 --> 12:59.120
about uh it's a documentary about people who decorate their houses for halloween it's extremely

12:59.120 --> 13:03.920
good if you have not seen it it's extremely good it's maybe the best halloween movie right behind

13:03.920 --> 13:10.560
a witch's ball but but one of the characters in there does a map of christmas lights sorry halloween

13:10.560 --> 13:16.160
decorations in the area and so he goes and asks people like is it okay if they have a big display

13:16.160 --> 13:22.960
he adds them to this map but he asked them like for permission before he adds them to the halloween

13:22.960 --> 13:28.720
lights map the halloween decoration map right i do like the idea of halloween like yeah it's

13:28.720 --> 13:34.240
beautiful um like just beautiful black lights um everybody walks down the street like going jogging

13:34.240 --> 13:40.880
it's like is that come i see it in the halloween black lights okay good just but what i what i'm

13:40.880 --> 13:47.840
saying is that he is suggesting like is it it is a wild distinction to make but is is it is your

13:47.840 --> 13:53.120
light for you can i look at these can i look at these bad boys but he's asking that these these

13:53.120 --> 13:59.120
these two people are asking a neighbor like hey do you think it's cool if we add your neighbors

13:59.120 --> 14:03.120
well who better they can't approach the house travis with the christmas lights on it without

14:03.120 --> 14:07.040
looking at the ding dang thing and they're not they don't want to do that if it's not for public

14:07.040 --> 14:11.840
and what are you hey you get away from here this is for my kids what they what they're asking is

14:11.840 --> 14:17.360
when you look at your neighbor's christmas lights how do they react yeah do they shoo you away and

14:17.360 --> 14:23.760
throw a big sheet over it it's not for you it's for little dylan to make his christmas magical

14:24.320 --> 14:28.960
you're using up all the magic with your foul eyes do you guys ever think about when you watch home

14:28.960 --> 14:37.200
alone like how in our now modern age how home alone could like never happen in basically every

14:37.200 --> 14:43.920
way start to finish oh yeah um yeah oh yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure like i put up a video

14:43.920 --> 14:49.840
doorbell and i was like okay yeah this would stop him right there also how would kevin make

14:49.840 --> 14:56.160
this doorbell electrocute people it's just a video thing yeah or you know kevin kevin pesci

14:56.160 --> 15:02.240
jesus christ we cannot record this podcast this early in the morning anymore because i just said

15:02.240 --> 15:08.000
kevin pesci out loud and i don't know who that is joe pesci's brother you've just docked someone

15:08.000 --> 15:15.200
he's a doctor uh perfectly real kevin pesci from spokane kevin pesci hacks your nest cams sees all

15:15.200 --> 15:22.720
the damn traps and then that's that's it that's all there is to it it's like facetime kevin from

15:22.720 --> 15:30.320
france or wherever and you're just like hey sorry we left you there you cool all right bye um be

15:30.320 --> 15:37.840
cool kid so i mean the alternative is that they were casing the joint oh absolutely you gotta

15:37.840 --> 15:45.520
be constantly every time the the fedex comes and delivers my blue apron box i know they're also

15:45.520 --> 15:50.400
like as long as i'm here i'm gonna see where the valuables are which is why i'm always every time

15:50.400 --> 15:54.640
anybody steps near my house i gotta rearrange where my valuables are and i gotta rearrange

15:54.640 --> 15:58.720
where all the traps are yep so annoying and it's so annoying because i don't remember where the

15:58.720 --> 16:05.200
damn traps are and i gotta send rachel the map and then you know henry's play zone i sometimes

16:05.200 --> 16:09.840
a trap ends up there and we have to figure that out and it gets very complicated because he loves

16:09.840 --> 16:14.800
the traps because they look very fun like fun toys uh one of them is made out of a balloon but the

16:14.800 --> 16:21.600
balloon's full of horrible you know human dissolving acid um and so we gotta balloon

16:21.600 --> 16:26.160
preserving human dissolving gas right and so we have humans and balloons are made out of different

16:26.160 --> 16:31.440
stuff just yeah read one book and so gotta remember which ones are the death balloons

16:31.440 --> 16:36.560
and which ones are fun balloons for babies let's see here's the thing griffin people will say that

16:36.560 --> 16:41.760
you're being too cautious but you've never been robbed so never been robbed because of all my

16:42.320 --> 16:46.880
they i put up a sign also in front of my house that says great traps inside move them around

16:46.880 --> 16:53.440
constantly so don't even try bother to case the joint kevin pesci i feel like occam's razor if

16:53.440 --> 17:02.160
they were casing um houses they would probably come up with a a patter that is less uh baffling

17:02.160 --> 17:07.920
they would probably have sort of a straight line like do you need us to clean your gutters or

17:07.920 --> 17:14.480
something that is not like inventing this whole idea of public christmas or like hey here's a

17:14.480 --> 17:20.720
here's your blue apron box and you say thanks you take it inside you set down in the kitchen

17:20.720 --> 17:27.200
you go to use the john or the lou and then joe pesci pops out of the blue apron box steals all

17:27.200 --> 17:33.680
of your things where'd my xbox one go damn it joe and also where's all my pre-portioned ingredients

17:33.680 --> 17:39.360
i can use to make home-cooked meals damn it i got double robbed i don't have an xbox to play

17:39.360 --> 17:44.400
crash bandicoot and all of my food from the blue aprons gone what am i gonna make sure what am i

17:44.400 --> 17:51.520
gonna eat when i don't play crash bandicoot you gotta make sure that your blue apron box does not

17:51.520 --> 17:56.640
contain any live joe pesci's every time i get a blue apron box i run my sword through it you got

17:56.640 --> 18:01.520
yeah just to make sure because he's gonna eat all your ding dang fresh cilantro first yeah and that's

18:01.520 --> 18:05.600
irritating you gotta go to sort of replace that daniel stern don't even take the food out he just

18:05.600 --> 18:09.840
rubs his nasty body all over it and so you don't you're like my xbox is gone but at least my food's

18:09.840 --> 18:15.200
here cook it up yum yum eat it wait a minute this tastes like daniel stern's nasty body shit

18:16.880 --> 18:24.000
daniel stern's hair post the events of home alone one is is i think oh i just thought about tasting

18:24.000 --> 18:29.920
daniel stern's hair i just thought about getting a big mouthful of that dude's head and i oh gosh

18:29.920 --> 18:35.440
blue apron almost never has daniel stern's hair stern's hair in it almost never that's a blue

18:35.440 --> 18:41.200
apron almost guarantee statistically speaking i've never gotten daniel stern's hair in my

18:41.200 --> 18:48.640
in my blue apron box right down the box 99.999999% free of daniel stern's hair now we do want to be

18:48.640 --> 18:53.120
clear it's mostly for blue apron we're not talking about a single strand of blue of of

18:53.120 --> 19:00.240
daniel stern's hair it's a lot of it would be a lot of hair to get it to register on the on the

19:00.240 --> 19:10.000
their sensors it needs to be a considerable amount of that warning on there but then one box showed

19:10.000 --> 19:15.840
up just completely full of nothing but daniel stern's hair if you're portioning out goat cheese

19:15.840 --> 19:20.880
you gotta assume some of daniel stern's hair it's gonna get in there i mean that's just

19:20.880 --> 19:28.240
the reality of everything like everything you buy from the store uh when you get a soda mcdonald's

19:28.240 --> 19:36.400
peanut butter all of it has some amount stern take a deep breath there's some daniel stern in there

19:36.400 --> 19:41.120
right i think it was carl sagan who said we are all made of stern stuff yes

19:43.680 --> 19:48.880
how about a yahoo i'd love that i'd love that it felt like we had reached the logical conclusion

19:48.880 --> 19:53.760
of the daniel stern jokes abigail love it sent this one and thank you abigail to yahoo answers

19:53.760 --> 19:58.400
user conquer the king who asked can i just say just a side note it always makes you really happy

19:58.400 --> 20:02.720
when there's a new name of someone who likes senate like i don't think i've ever heard abigail's name

20:02.720 --> 20:07.760
before and it's nice to know that there's like new yahoo soldiers listen i'm very thankful for

20:07.760 --> 20:14.320
the great yahoo's that everybody sends in week to week and i hope nobody takes takes the uh recurring

20:14.320 --> 20:20.800
people it's a who send them in like getting on the show all the time it is an art form it is an art

20:20.800 --> 20:26.880
form to find these uh trash bags but not just trash bags trash bags that perfectly sort of fit

20:26.880 --> 20:33.200
the the tone and nature of our show but abigail love it has done some great work here because

20:33.200 --> 20:42.160
conquer the king asks why is paul mccartney stingy by stingy i mean why is he so greedy

20:42.160 --> 20:47.360
with his music to the point that he isn't letting people play the beatles songs on youtube i know

20:47.360 --> 20:51.760
he has a right to his music just like all artists however being that the songs are a beloved classic

20:51.760 --> 20:56.640
that is over 40 years old he shouldn't be greedy that people love his music so much they are willing

20:56.640 --> 21:02.160
to want to listen to it yeah he should be like other artists do which is be grateful that people

21:02.160 --> 21:09.520
listen to his music and stop being so stingy paul mccartney yeah and this is not something i believe

21:09.520 --> 21:13.920
and i need to go ahead and say that out loud because the streaming music industry has pretty

21:13.920 --> 21:19.920
much decimated the music industry as far as i understand it and that's no good and people

21:19.920 --> 21:25.840
artists are completely entitled to receiving compensation for the hard work that they do

21:25.840 --> 21:31.680
and pay an artist quit expecting them to do everything for free but i i don't know why paul

21:31.680 --> 21:40.560
mccartney won't let the great beatles music be on youtube let it be you know just let it be you

21:40.560 --> 21:46.080
know eight days a week let me listen to it help i'm not i'm not saying all artists i have a problem

21:46.080 --> 21:54.800
with them just paul mccartney just paul mccartney is every time excuse me i you try to hide it right

21:54.800 --> 22:00.560
and it's like here's a fun clip of my family barbecue but really paperback writers in there

22:00.560 --> 22:08.000
and paul mccartney somehow no matter how hard you try to bury the beatles music his music

22:08.000 --> 22:13.840
these are my songs he knows and at this point it's just like paul can't you just be happy that

22:13.840 --> 22:20.880
people like like what are you trying to do make money off of your music the songs are so old paul

22:20.880 --> 22:28.880
and beloved people like them isn't that enough for you can you use that they're so old paul come

22:28.880 --> 22:35.280
paul's just like paul's just sitting on his throne made of money and i'm trying to listen to these

22:35.280 --> 22:43.920
i can't stress this enough super old songs you're lucky that i'm even listening to your old music

22:43.920 --> 22:50.320
because i should be listening to new hot top 40 jams but instead i'm listening to your ancient

22:50.320 --> 22:58.640
scrawlings paul it was record that was recorded with like a bird pecking on stone oh yeah i know

22:58.640 --> 23:05.120
and and and like edison thomas edison like looked up from the you know gramophone and gave him a

23:05.120 --> 23:11.920
thumbs up it's like coming out great paul every time i listen to a song that's older than 10 years

23:11.920 --> 23:19.040
old which at this point encompasses a lot of the black eyed peas body of work i get this dusty taste

23:19.040 --> 23:27.440
in my mouth and the beatles music so old that i listen to you know back in the ussr and i'm just

23:27.440 --> 23:36.000
like oh god it's so old you're lucky about a place that doesn't even exist anymore you're lucky i'm

23:36.000 --> 23:43.680
listening to your old music i bought a beatles album and i immediately of course opened it up

23:43.680 --> 23:49.920
and upturned it to see all the web exclusive content behind the scenes footage that was gonna

23:49.920 --> 23:56.800
fall out of it and do you know how much did fall out of this record none what yeah i was like i was

23:56.800 --> 24:05.840
like scouring it looking for some sort of twitter handle on it that i could use to like thank them

24:05.840 --> 24:12.400
for the music and complain about the price and there wasn't a single one like do you want like

24:12.400 --> 24:17.440
where is the hashtag do you want me to tweet about this record or not because i'm not going to just

24:17.440 --> 24:22.480
make one up justin how many youtubers were like partnered with them on certain songs and like

24:22.480 --> 24:27.360
featuring like some 12 year old youtuber like there was a lot of that though right here's the

24:27.360 --> 24:36.960
thing trap is gonna bug you out but um uh unless ellenor rigby is like some hot tuber that i have

24:36.960 --> 24:45.040
not heard of before i don't think it had like any youtube people wait at all yeah you heard how do

24:45.040 --> 24:51.680
they get people listen i don't know i mean i felt like it was kind of an act of charity on my behalf

24:51.680 --> 24:59.200
yeah like reinforcing i went the narrative i went to a record store which is basically like a

24:59.200 --> 25:08.240
retirement home for music if you really think about it and i picked up um paul's album the fun

25:08.240 --> 25:14.720
title one that's like dr pepper's fun time jamboree took it home to put it in my record

25:14.720 --> 25:19.920
player open it up two bats flew out of it old this old music guys it's and now it's a dangerous

25:19.920 --> 25:26.480
public health hazard because the bats the bats fly into my traps and then they're deactivated

25:26.480 --> 25:32.160
and now i have now i have holes in the in the reinforcements that the the you know the blue

25:32.160 --> 25:37.520
apron thieves are absolutely gonna know about like we don't pay shakespeare when you do shakespeare

25:37.520 --> 25:42.000
shows shakespeare's not like getting on youtube like let me see who's quoting hamlet and they're

25:42.000 --> 25:48.080
like product trying videos come on paul mccartney you're basically shakespeare you're both british

25:48.080 --> 25:54.720
i think come on yeah the beatles paul mccartney who you think you are shakespeare uh it's a bit

25:54.720 --> 25:58.800
of a stretch you're a little full of yourself a little high on the horse a little bit paul

25:59.920 --> 26:07.040
paul paul i did like your halo song the song you did for the halo game that wasn't quite halo was

26:07.040 --> 26:11.840
great but paul very good and again artists should be paid for i feel like i have to say this like

26:11.840 --> 26:16.480
10 times artists should be paid for their time and energy yes absolutely 100 all of them don't

26:16.480 --> 26:22.160
steal stuff pay people to do designs for you pay people to do music for you just not paul mccartney

26:22.160 --> 26:27.040
can be a little stingy sometimes when uh the beatles great music and by great i mean like

26:27.040 --> 26:30.960
really old but good and like the old way where you're like you know you watch an old movie or

26:30.960 --> 26:35.680
hear old songs like i see what you're going for if there needs to be like a christmas carol where

26:35.680 --> 26:39.840
like three ghosts appear to paul mccartney and they're like hey just let people use your music

26:39.840 --> 26:46.720
paul and old music is good when you only view it or listen to it through the lens of like well

26:46.720 --> 26:53.200
clearly it's not like black eyed peas good but black eyed peas have 40 years of like extra

26:53.920 --> 26:59.920
learnings that they use to make their great music and so i think the number one lesson that black

26:59.920 --> 27:07.600
eyed peas taught us was don't put a year number in your song right because then maybe 10 years

27:07.600 --> 27:14.560
later 2008 won't be so new and fresh and impressive sort of like the rubin stuttered hit

27:15.360 --> 27:21.040
this is my sorry for 2004 uh don't you think rubin kicks himself right in the shorts for

27:21.040 --> 27:29.040
not waiting 13 years on that one gosh darn it um how about another question yes

27:29.840 --> 27:35.520
i just got paid artists for the time i just got hired just not paul mccartney i just got hired

27:35.520 --> 27:41.120
at a law firm next summer uh for next summer and the head partner invited me to a holiday dinner

27:41.120 --> 27:46.080
party with the rest of the firm's employees the problem is i have to order my meal in advance

27:47.120 --> 27:53.840
my choices of protein are crab cakes chicken or filet mignon with sizes sweet potato fries

27:53.840 --> 28:00.080
scallop potatoes or green beans how is this at all a problem this sounds dope how is this at all an

28:00.080 --> 28:08.240
issue this will let me finish okay listen all right listen god uh this will be my first interaction

28:08.240 --> 28:14.160
with the firm and i'm worried that picking the filet will come off too pretentious what should

28:14.160 --> 28:22.800
i choose the steaks thank you i've never been hired oh my god okay griffin look at this though

28:22.800 --> 28:29.600
right wait oh all right that's from perplexed in the clean plate club wow overtalk's gonna get way

28:29.600 --> 28:34.480
better on this show if justin has a punishment button which is paul stanley yelling at us to

28:34.480 --> 28:40.320
listen what we've got here toronto well that one's not applicable justin so i hit the wrong button

28:40.800 --> 28:47.200
okay we've got a logic puzzle here right you have three protein options and you have to get

28:47.200 --> 28:51.680
them across the river but you only have one raft the crab cakes will eat the filet mignon and you

28:51.680 --> 28:59.760
have three side options and there is a right combination that will get you promoted before you

28:59.760 --> 29:06.960
even start working oh shit right but if you say crab cakes and green beans are like crab cakes

29:06.960 --> 29:12.400
this is a young man uh who dreams of the sea he's not going to focus on his job and you're like oh

29:12.400 --> 29:18.240
i want chicken and scallop potatoes and it's like ah he thinks he's a simple man with simple desires

29:18.240 --> 29:23.040
he has no he has no dreams he has no aspirations and if you're like i want flame mignon and sweet

29:23.040 --> 29:28.720
potato fries and it's like oh la dee da look at mr high and mighty filet mignon over here

29:28.720 --> 29:33.840
right i yeah you must like the minion movies he's a child right it's bad all around i would

29:33.840 --> 29:40.240
like to suggest okay let's all have our ideal combination here oh i've got it out here's what

29:40.240 --> 29:49.040
i would like to suggest um green beans and then right in at the bottom i will bring my own meat

29:49.040 --> 29:56.480
because that's somebody who is worried about the bottom line has sort of like culinary prowess

29:56.480 --> 30:02.000
because they they are willing to like cook their own food and bring it along and it's somebody who

30:02.000 --> 30:10.080
uh uh never you know never wants to do things by the company line they want to think outside the

30:10.080 --> 30:15.440
bun thank you travis none of these foods have buns well all of these all of these foods are outside

30:15.440 --> 30:21.280
of the bun now justin that only works if you can if your dish you bring and you lift the little

30:21.280 --> 30:27.520
metal cover off of it and it is more impressively cooked and plated than what has been served oh

30:27.520 --> 30:33.520
shit fucking uh yeah i didn't i didn't uh choose my own meal because i brought my own gordo and

30:33.520 --> 30:37.520
then gordon ramsay's like i wish you wouldn't call me that and you're like i can call you with a

30:37.520 --> 30:43.680
fuck i want to call you gordon ramsay that's maybe the biggest power play that you have available to

30:43.680 --> 30:49.280
you and you yell at gordon ramsay till he cries if you can make gordon ramsay cry at this christmas

30:49.280 --> 30:55.040
party first of all gordon wants to be back in in the uk with his family during christmas time so

30:55.040 --> 30:59.360
you know that you're gonna impress them because they're like wow what's he got on gordon ramsay

30:59.360 --> 31:05.680
that he is able to pull him away from his beautiful family um my suggestion is this you get

31:05.680 --> 31:14.880
the flight you get the filet mignon with a side of filet mignon oh and then you say two things i'm

31:14.880 --> 31:21.120
hungry for advancement you don't say that second part but they'll know and then you also say i'm

31:21.120 --> 31:25.360
eating two filet mignons because i'm gonna work twice as hard as any of these other bastards

31:26.720 --> 31:30.720
you say all that you do say all that part out loud this actually goes along with what

31:30.720 --> 31:38.320
my kobayashi maru which was you just check all of them okay i will have the filet mignon with

31:38.320 --> 31:43.840
crab cakes and chicken on top and a side of sweet potato fries mixed with scalloped potatoes

31:43.840 --> 31:48.960
mixed with green beans thank you very much oh yeah or because the summer is a long time away

31:48.960 --> 31:54.560
and you might not even get that job but you'll have eaten the equivalent of three free meals

31:54.560 --> 32:01.040
oh i see it's sort of a grift situation could mark them all and then right at the bottom

32:01.040 --> 32:07.760
please donate mine to hungry orphans and they'll be like oh wow wow that's a big play or

32:08.400 --> 32:14.080
you bring your own big bowl and you mush them all up into just one big nasty mess

32:14.960 --> 32:22.560
and then you eat that with your hands and then the boss is like i like his style i'll have that too

32:22.560 --> 32:29.680
yeah pretty soon can i have some of your nasty mess only if you make me the boss okay yes right

32:29.680 --> 32:34.080
just write a little note on the card please provide table blender yeah because you'll want

32:34.080 --> 32:40.720
definitely want that oh just write in dealer's choice that is the worst choice right back on

32:40.720 --> 32:45.280
them that is the dealer's choice will be no food you get nothing because they are not going to

32:45.280 --> 32:51.680
bother with that that's true don't mark a protein but next to green beans right seven and see if

32:51.680 --> 33:04.400
you can get a seven times huge green beans x7 people are gonna remember that guy you should

33:04.400 --> 33:15.840
call your boss and say a quick question what are green beans are these beans that you have dyed

33:15.840 --> 33:23.280
green in some way um mark mark sweet potato fries and steak but next to green beans put a question

33:23.280 --> 33:29.600
mark green beans and then their boss will be like well green beans are these fun little pods full of

33:29.600 --> 33:36.320
these small weird nasty beans and you say okay i've learned that and now you've shown that you

33:36.320 --> 33:46.240
are quick to learn ready for advancement ready to go i i maybe just mark out the green on green

33:46.240 --> 33:52.720
beans and then mark that so i want some beans of a different whatever sort of variety you can you

33:52.720 --> 33:58.480
can dig up in the kitchen yeah and write it mark it out and then write in uh scalloped sweet beans

33:58.480 --> 34:07.680
scallop sweet beans with chicken with chicken cakes you figure it out i'm a fussy dude and i

34:07.680 --> 34:15.040
need chicken cakes or else i'm gonna cry at the party turn it into sort of a logic flow so next

34:15.040 --> 34:21.920
to chicken right if tenders yes if no proceed to next option and then you just have like a

34:21.920 --> 34:25.840
sort of a flow chart to really make it as complicated as possible but that shows what

34:25.840 --> 34:35.280
frosting yeah right with butter butter cream please uh could you just say i'll i'll pick

34:35.280 --> 34:38.400
to find out what your boss is getting this is actually a great thing find out what your boss

34:38.400 --> 34:41.920
is getting and get the exact same thing or get something different and then at the party you

34:41.920 --> 34:49.040
sit down next to your boss this is so important and you say splitsies yeah oh yeah split wanted

34:49.040 --> 34:54.160
all those options he definitely has also struggled with this and then insist on paying half the check

34:54.160 --> 34:59.280
for the whole table and they'll keep saying like no this is the whole the business is paying for it

34:59.280 --> 35:05.120
and you keep saying like are you sure because i'll i'll cover it this one could be on me it's like

35:05.120 --> 35:09.760
you haven't even started working here you're like okay but you like really keep being insistent but

35:09.760 --> 35:15.440
if at any point there is a ripcord here if at any point the boss is like okay cool you're like no

35:16.480 --> 35:20.880
i was lying i don't have i guess i don't i don't get the job that's a lot that's far too much money

35:20.880 --> 35:29.200
don't mark any food but at the bottom make an option for lots of overdue paperwork and so when

35:29.200 --> 35:34.960
everybody else is eating and just like the beef juice is dribbling down their chin you'll be like

35:34.960 --> 35:40.240
hammering it away at all the shit kathy left for the new year and you're gonna be the one making

35:40.240 --> 35:44.800
everybody else look lazy and you'll be the one digging the company out of the red and hoisting

35:44.800 --> 35:55.200

40:16.800 --> 40:27.840
cool shindig for hip people this next one i can't tell what's going on with the for and from

40:27.840 --> 40:35.760
um i don't know if it's a secret message or just like the coolest name i've ever seen somebody

40:35.760 --> 40:41.120
may have gotten confused when they were filling out sort of the metadata of the message because

40:41.120 --> 40:48.000
it says who's this message for and what they've put here is where like w h e r e who's this

40:48.000 --> 40:54.240
message from where so it's possible they saw these questions were like where do you want me to put

40:54.240 --> 41:00.160
this data where do you where do you where is this supposed to go where they did find the box they

41:00.160 --> 41:08.560
did so what's the message trough are you fucking done yet no i no that's the message are you fucking

41:08.560 --> 41:15.280
done yet sigh probably not keep at it though books don't just make themselves just watch out

41:15.280 --> 41:21.520
for a hundred dolls as you print those bastards will get you thanks bros for keeping me laughing

41:21.520 --> 41:28.720
late into the work night you guys are the best hugs um and they wanted that message in 2017

41:28.720 --> 41:33.920
so some important stuff in here a lot actually they they said that their preferred time frame

41:33.920 --> 41:40.400
is whatever's latest i mean this message is applicable until at least 2018 so they definitely

41:40.400 --> 41:46.320
like have a large window here i think this is a message for themselves from themselves to

41:46.320 --> 41:53.280
encourage themselves to finish the book they're writing i love that a lot of people though are i

41:53.280 --> 42:00.640
don't know that book printers are some of the most like haunted buildings oh god yes we're doing the

42:00.640 --> 42:05.840
taz graphic novel uh and they were like do you want to come by and see the magic of books getting

42:05.840 --> 42:10.400
printed and i said nice try because once i step inside my spirit will never leave because of the

42:10.400 --> 42:16.560
grudge yeah well i mean i'm pretty sure that only ghosts work in the print industry anymore

42:16.560 --> 42:22.720
oh yeah what does that even mean trap uh well uh got something what's it mean do you have a thing

42:22.720 --> 42:28.400
well like print is dying i think i don't know but that's not what that means what

42:29.680 --> 42:34.400
yeah books are crushing it books are doing great good yeah but i'm pretty sure books are back books

42:34.400 --> 42:41.360

to expand the scope for the show as we head into 2018 this one is a sweet frog you know no sweet

44:03.040 --> 44:09.280
frog it's a frozen yogurt literally never heard of it sweet frog brings back deck the halls christmas

44:09.280 --> 44:15.920
spectacle sweet frog frozen yogurt is gonna put on a real christmas spectacle throughout the holiday

44:15.920 --> 44:23.440
season with a deck the halls benefit night nights plural that's important to keep in mind hosted by

44:23.440 --> 44:28.800
participating locations from coast to coast okay so here's the promotion and i want you to really

44:28.800 --> 44:33.280
as i'm setting the stage for this i want you to really like sort of envision it church and school

44:33.280 --> 44:38.960
choirs throughout the country have partnered with local sweet frog shops to host benefit night

44:38.960 --> 44:45.920
fundraisers these choirs will perform all the holiday favorites to help them raise much needed

44:45.920 --> 44:51.440
funds for local initiatives to make these events even more special sweet frog will produce a video

44:51.440 --> 44:57.680
christmas card using a montage of local choirs performing all over the country that video

44:57.680 --> 45:04.960
christmas card will then be posted on all sweet frog social media outlets so basically you go in

45:05.600 --> 45:12.880
everybody who's in the choir gets a free frozen yogurt nice count it and all the sales from that

45:12.880 --> 45:21.520
night a portion 25 of all the sales go to uh the um the charity while the choir is performing wow

45:21.520 --> 45:28.160
25 can you imagine all of us at sweet frog love this annual event that gets us in the christmas

45:28.160 --> 45:33.760
spirit says their ceo patrick gallagher uh it's a wonderful time of community fellowship as people

45:33.760 --> 45:38.320
come together to celebrate christmas what better way to do that than enjoying the sounds of the

45:38.320 --> 45:43.200
season sung by local choirs we are proud to showcase great local talent and support local

45:43.200 --> 45:47.680
churches and schools while helping our sweet frog owners generate some serious winter foot traffic

45:47.680 --> 45:54.240
okay yeah i have two problems the first one is can i just eat my fucking frozen yogurt

45:54.800 --> 46:02.480
please it is i am sad it is the holidays i am alone and i came in to eat some frozen yogurt

46:02.480 --> 46:11.280
and just try to like fucking chill have you ever ever been in a frozen yogurt shop the size of

46:11.280 --> 46:18.480
which you thought this is a place i would love to get blasted by jingle bells being screamed at me

46:18.480 --> 46:34.560
by 40 people never ever ever never the the other thing yeah the other thing is 25 that is so nice

46:34.560 --> 46:41.600
let me just real quick run the margins on frozen yogurt oh that's right it's 98

46:41.600 --> 46:51.280
percent you literally take cow stuff and add some sugar and then you sell it for a hundred

46:51.280 --> 46:57.520
dollars as somebody who's worked in the yogurt industry i can confirm justin's justin's math on

46:57.520 --> 47:05.760
on this one um this is also like as somebody who's worked in the yogurt industry yes the cold months

47:05.760 --> 47:14.240
are not necessarily the hottest time for a sweet frog or a yogurt land or the country's best yogurt

47:14.240 --> 47:18.560
and so this this feels like you're just trying to trying to get us in the trying to get us in the

47:18.560 --> 47:25.520
door my main concern is that you know with the introduction of local church choirs it ain't just

47:25.520 --> 47:31.040
gonna be jingle bells it's there's going it's gonna get there's gonna be some jay-su in the mix

47:31.040 --> 47:41.040
and there's gotta be you know there's an important separation between church and yogurt and i'm

47:41.040 --> 47:48.480
worried that this is blurring the line so you know what though i think it sounds maybe a little nice

47:50.000 --> 47:56.400
okay well here's holly sylvias who is of charlestown west virginia oh hey thank you

47:56.400 --> 48:05.040
hey hello um and holly is going to be uh putting on a a deck the halls event in her store and here's

48:05.040 --> 48:11.360
the quote we invited a local school choir fourth and fifth graders to perform good good love this

48:11.360 --> 48:18.560
yogurt because it's kids i'm anticipating a huge crowd which is great children really shine when

48:18.560 --> 48:22.160
they have a chance to perform in front of an audience so i want to pack the place out we'll

48:22.160 --> 48:26.800
move tables out of the way to make more room if needed so she's really just like in this press

48:26.800 --> 48:33.200
release kind of thinking through the logistics of this event and also so okay so i'm just gonna

48:33.200 --> 48:40.080
enjoy my frozen yogurt while standing up well i'll stay i'll just stand then so i'll just stand

48:40.080 --> 48:45.440
i paid nine dollars for this frozen yogurt but i'll go ahead and stand in a corner could you

48:46.000 --> 48:51.760
excuse me little kid could you scoot over i'm trying to get to the yogurt i just please just

48:51.760 --> 48:56.640
let me get my yogurt and when was the last time anybody bought yogurt and said oh i can't wait

48:56.640 --> 49:03.600
to sit down and enjoy this here at the yogurt place um as somebody worked in the yogurt industry

49:04.400 --> 49:11.520
they'll do they'll do that and it's just it's like when you turn in a test at school and the

49:11.520 --> 49:16.240
teacher grades it right there in front of you because it's like oh boy i hope they enjoy the

49:16.240 --> 49:21.760
work i've done there sometimes they'll look over at you and be like too much crushed up heath bar

49:21.760 --> 49:28.880
i'll be like i'm sorry i'll do better next time here's your money back praise jesus love love it

49:28.880 --> 49:37.120
love his stuff i think this sounds nice i like a good carol and i like carolers and i don't know

49:37.120 --> 49:43.520
that this would necessarily make me want to go get cold cream in the cold cold harsh winter texas

49:43.520 --> 49:49.840
months um but i think it sounds sweet and i think that justin was mean for no fun of it let me side

49:49.840 --> 49:58.000
with justin here because i think were i unprepared for this site to await me and my frozen yogurt

49:58.000 --> 50:04.640
shop and i opened the door just wanting to grab a quick frozen treat on my way home from a hard

50:04.640 --> 50:13.920
day at the office and i opened the door and there was like an army of children singing about jesus i

50:13.920 --> 50:20.800
don't think i'd think oh awesome now imagine instead travis you walked in and there was a

50:20.800 --> 50:26.880
man dressed in halloween clothing standing alone on a stage while you enjoyed frozen yogurt and he

50:26.880 --> 50:35.360
opened his mouth and i put my hand inside a toilet yeah that would rule yeah we're all very i mean if

50:35.360 --> 50:42.000
we wanted to do a winter promotion um i feel like what would be dope is like hey this is griffin

50:42.000 --> 50:48.080
for sweet frog i've changed i've jumped over like the can you hear me now guy and i'm a trader to

50:48.080 --> 50:52.320
the country's best yogurt and there's a lot of shit you don't know about that brand but anyway

50:52.320 --> 50:56.480
i'm excited to announce for the cold winter months you gotta have your frozen yogurt fixed

50:56.480 --> 51:02.880
and that's why i've invented hot yogurt and it's the new jam that you are just gonna love and come

51:02.880 --> 51:10.400
hey get out oh baby it's cold outside enjoy this hot yogurt it's the new thing i've developed and

51:10.400 --> 51:17.680
it burns the mouth so so bad you have to it'll be like an hour before you can really enjoy it

51:17.680 --> 51:22.720
and don't put any toppings in it because the toppings will be destroyed in this molten hot

51:22.720 --> 51:29.600
yogurt this steaming plasma of yogurt um but it's better people are serving you yogurt that has

51:29.600 --> 51:36.080
living things in it and our yogurt is served at a temperature in which no living these cultures will

51:36.080 --> 51:44.000
be obliterated there is no sort of gastrointestinal sort of benefits to be gleaned from this very very

51:44.000 --> 51:52.640
very very hot burning fiery yogurt and in fact why the opposite you will regret in you regret

51:52.640 --> 51:57.840
consuming it yes because it'll burn all your insides out it'll burn a hole right through you

51:57.840 --> 52:01.920
and if that don't get you the asbestos cup is definitely not going to be good for the health

52:02.720 --> 52:07.120
it's made of fiberglass basically and it's going to get in the hot yogurt and there's nothing we

52:07.120 --> 52:12.880
talked to the scientists and there's nothing we can do about it how about a yahoo yeah please

52:12.880 --> 52:17.920
merit palmer sent this one in thank you merit it's from an anonymous yahoo user i'm gonna call

52:17.920 --> 52:25.920
him the guy from the i put my hand inside toilet video asks how many horses would it take to pull

52:25.920 --> 52:32.640
a horse trailer full of horses oh shit i'm so excited to get into this question with you boys

52:32.640 --> 52:38.800
because we're gonna say a bunch of dumb math stuff but how many horses would it take to pull a horse

52:38.800 --> 52:50.480
trailer that is just chocoblock full of horses wow it can't just be one to one right so here's

52:50.480 --> 52:56.640
the question if let's here's what we need to establish first we need to what's the word tear

52:56.640 --> 53:01.680
the scale a little bit is that how you pronounce that we're gonna tear we gotta tear it right so

53:01.680 --> 53:09.040
how many horses does a horse trailer weigh i'm gonna say probably about six horses you're saying

53:09.040 --> 53:14.400
sans horses empty horse trailer i think is about six horses worth of weight horses okay and you

53:14.400 --> 53:21.760
can probably get like a decent sized horse trailer maybe five more horses in it so that's 11 horses

53:21.760 --> 53:32.960
okay okay okay can one dude you need 11 horses to pull 11 horses worth of weight or does the term

53:32.960 --> 53:41.520
horsepower refer to the amount of joules of force required to pull one horse against its will well

53:41.520 --> 53:47.600
here's here's the question and i think we have to remove this factor or else this will be here all

53:47.600 --> 53:54.400
day and everyone's gonna say like well with wheels on it that simple machine makes it easier okay

53:54.400 --> 54:03.440
cool remove remove the wheel we are in a paralogic scenario here where there is no wheel or like

54:03.440 --> 54:09.200
sled or we factor out the wheels and say the wheels will get you about two horses worth off

54:09.200 --> 54:14.640
so now we're talking about nine horses and that's a very i just punched the numbers into siri and

54:14.640 --> 54:20.400
she told me the wheels will counteract the weight of about two horses so now nine horses do we then

54:20.400 --> 54:27.440
need nine horses pulling santa's sleigh tonight and bringing all the good boys and girls uh gift

54:27.440 --> 54:36.480
of horses or is that not how any of this works well let's take okay griffin we've calculated this

54:36.480 --> 54:44.480
the the the weight of the trailer right uh so now let's imagine 11 horses and each horse is riding

54:44.480 --> 54:52.960
on the back of another horse right so you would need one horse per horse this is a lot what you've

54:52.960 --> 54:57.760
just entered into the equation which is horse stacking yeah but you couldn't put two horses on

54:57.760 --> 55:03.120
one horse it wouldn't fit this is gonna trick about that this is gonna trip you all out okay

55:03.120 --> 55:07.840
i'm here to complicate things i did a quick google just to provide a little science okay

55:09.200 --> 55:15.840
this is this is complicated but a single draft horse i don't know what that means

55:15.840 --> 55:22.160
can pull a load up to 8000 pounds what draft horse is when you get on tap instead of in a bottle

55:22.160 --> 55:27.680
right okay so get one horse out of a bottle it can pull 8000 pounds how much a horse way probably

55:27.680 --> 55:33.760
about 4000 pounds so travis can google that while i'm reading these facts how much horseway don't

55:33.760 --> 55:38.400
you don't have to say it don't use like your speech how much horseway just go ahead and type

55:38.400 --> 55:45.920
it all fine siri so much horseway so griffin if i told you one draft horse can pull uh a load up

55:45.920 --> 55:59.680
to 8000 pounds yeah how much would two horses be able to pull 16 000 pounds no wrong two draft

55:59.680 --> 56:06.480
horses can i guess together and i guess yes 12 000 pounds no can i guess can i guess can i guess

56:06.480 --> 56:14.560
yes 20 000 pounds of raw horse material no that's incorrect can i guess can i guess can i guess yeah

56:14.560 --> 56:24.960
yeah 45 000 pounds 45 pounds 45 pounds all right listen what they can actually pull and there's a

56:24.960 --> 56:31.440
lesson in this and we're gonna find it what they can pull working together is not 16 000 pounds

56:31.440 --> 56:40.320
or double they can pull 24 000 pounds they could pull three times whoa they're usual by working

56:40.320 --> 56:47.920
working together holy shit think about yeah because they build up momentum every action has

56:47.920 --> 56:53.520
an equal opposite reaction except for two horses as the great law says from the 10 commandments

56:54.640 --> 57:01.840
and so then we shit okay so now we got 11 horses right 11 horses worth take off the wheels that's

57:01.840 --> 57:08.320
nine horses if it's a factor of tripling every time you add another horse then three horses

57:08.320 --> 57:17.360
can then pull let me run the numbers on this real quick 72 000 pounds the three horses only so

57:17.360 --> 57:23.120
they're dragging like a building behind them they can definitely if we get 10 horses and strap them

57:23.120 --> 57:28.560
to the earth we can counteract the rotation of the earth and destroy everything here is where it gets

57:28.560 --> 57:35.840
it gets worse guys it gets more complicated two horses that have worked together for a long time

57:35.840 --> 57:43.760
buddies get out pals that like long-time collaborators can pull actually pull 32 000

57:43.760 --> 57:49.600
pounds wait as heavy as they even can pull by themselves so now we have to factor in like

57:49.600 --> 57:54.880
partnership drift these fucking horses are in the drift and they can pull the earth out of orbit

57:54.880 --> 58:01.280
so you're telling me two horses we're in a like a buddy cop scenario here we're like two horses

58:01.280 --> 58:06.560
at first they're both loose cannons this horse is by the books and this book this horse is out

58:06.560 --> 58:13.040
there trying new shit and at first they're maybe maybe on a good day pulling 22 000 pounds right

58:13.040 --> 58:19.280
but then they start to see within each other like you know we're not so different you and i and over

58:19.280 --> 58:30.400
the years they just get it well enough that suddenly they are 8 000 pounds stronger it's

58:30.400 --> 58:39.040
amazing you're trying but that a ton a u.s short ton is 2 000 pounds you're telling me that these

58:39.040 --> 58:49.440
two horses can pull 16 tons of raw horse meat 16 tons what do you get it's just two horses

58:49.440 --> 58:56.560
two horses friends two best like best friend horses how do you as a horse owner and owner of

58:56.560 --> 59:03.840
the most buckwild freight company ever make these horses become best friends so that your margins

59:03.840 --> 59:08.400
on no how do you stop them that's this is terrifying you can't stop them can't stop

59:08.400 --> 59:14.160
i guarantee farmers look out of their windows and they see two horses like you know we gotta

59:16.160 --> 59:22.000
destroy our house which right like and we gotta go break that up we can't okay a horse an adult

59:22.000 --> 59:28.960
horse i looked this up siri told me an adult horse weighs between 840 to 2200 pounds so let's call

59:28.960 --> 59:37.920
it let's call it 16 as an average 1600 pounds so if these two horses are pulling 32 000 pounds

59:37.920 --> 59:44.960
and we use 1600 as an average we're talking about imagine looking out your window and seeing two

59:44.960 --> 59:53.680
two brutal best friend horses pulling 20 fucking horses behind them oh no it's okay guys we've got

59:53.680 --> 01:00:02.080
it we are longtime friends and we are going to pull all 20 of you in this trailer and then the

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.560
horse is like fucking high five because they also figured out how to do that because they're best

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.520
best friends now wait a minute i did not factor in what did we say six horses worth of weight in a

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:20.320
in a usual trailer minus two for the wheels so that's 16 horses 16 horses still 16 horses that's

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:28.640
a mate that is it is so you're telling me yes it is more cost effective for two horses to pull 16

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:35.360
horses than to just have all 18 horses walk all right let me add one can i also add by the way

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:42.560
that we have now like completely completely obliterated any value to the term horsepower

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:49.200
because it is not it is not a i mean are they uh you know 400 horsepower is that 400 horses

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:55.360
400 horsepower would destroy the galaxy yeah are they best friends are they are really like have

01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:01.520
they worked together for a long time like there's so many factors in this horsepower also why are

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:07.440
we talking about this as clean energy because two horses apparently it all compounds just have like

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.600
six horses and you can power all of america why are we fucking with cars like why are we even

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.680
messing around with it i'll i'll talk about hey elon i'll hop on two horses i'll get to san

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.440
francisco in like an hour and a half right why aren't horses pulling my goddamn car

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:34.240
yeah why are we doing engines and gas and stuff so if i griffin am best friends with my horse

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:41.920
which i am take real good care make a big sweater for it with four leg holes love my horse

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.480
if me and my horse try to pull a trailer how much weight can we do because i think the horse gets

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:55.680
the breath the the best friend buff uh-huh the best friend strength buff and i obviously am it's

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.960
going to be carrying most of the weight literally in this situation does it still get the extra

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:08.480
strength from me the horse's best friend how much can you pull griffin probably about 4500 pounds

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:14.240
okay if i really if i if i'm wearing my cleats and i can really dig in there okay so griffin

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:20.400
can pull 4500 pounds and the horse by itself can pull 8000 but it gets the best friend buff

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:28.880
so it gets the best friend buff i'm gonna say you can pull a together 18 000 pounds and that will

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.760
i absolutely can't keep up with my best friend the horse and i will be obliterated by this 18 000

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.440
joules of force horse trailer you'll be ripped in half i'll all be destroyed at some point though

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.960
at some point though can't the best friend buff start to work against you like if one horse is

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.840
having an off day do you think there's a chance his partner horse because they are such close

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.680
friends would be like we're gonna take a little slower today like there are some days where it's

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.680
actually worse than typical horse performance because they do want to slow it down for their

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.320
friend or they want to enjoy they haven't caught up for a while so they slow it down like no reason

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.520
to rush chester yeah well you have to be careful because if like if one of your horses is sick and

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.000
you partner the other one with a new horse and then the sick horse sees that he's like i thought

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.680
we were best friends and like now oh good point yeah now there's an issue of like well i don't

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.760
want to partner with you anymore well that's what blinders are for to keep the horses from

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:30.000
seeing when the other horses are becoming other best friends with other horses man there's a lot

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.480
that goes into this you're in the horse trailer and the horse trailer is just not moving like

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.680
what the fuck's up and you listen to the two horses in front it's like that's my wife derrick

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:48.560
and it's like oh shit all right so i guess the answer to this is two pretty much anything you

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:54.880
want to haul yeah two good best friend horses can pretty much do it and that's a good lesson for us

01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:01.600
if we all we don't just all need to work together we need to start working together now so our load

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:07.840
will steadily increase that we can haul together as a people then how can we get that gang gang

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:16.240
2018 stronger together oh that's not bad holy shit that's really good because that was both

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:21.200
was like romantic but also mates in the way of like friends but also like yeah yeah all working

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:27.760
yeah i was thinking about it platonically 2018 stronger together we can we you can do you can do

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.120
a lot by yourself and you should and you got to try but with another person you can pull 3600

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:39.200
pounds we like a lot of themes recently have celebrated self-interest yeah this one 30 30

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:48.080
3018 for the for the year 3018 2018 just find a bud or something because it's positive but it also

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:54.400
goes along with that like mount up ride or die we're all in this together fight together i do

01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:00.960
wonder if you we this needs a particularly large coda too and that we're not incur like

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:07.440
we're not trying to repopulate the earth and increase mating amongst peoples well what if

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.320
we say it with like a british affectation so every time you say it yeah it's got to be like

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:21.520
2019 2019 and i don't know how we write that out yeah yeah um lot in there okay uh folks that is
