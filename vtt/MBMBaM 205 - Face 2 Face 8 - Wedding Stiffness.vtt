00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on the wall, I have seen it.

00:13.000 --> 00:22.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:22.000 --> 00:45.000
What's up, you cool kids?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you, my dear wizard.

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
As excited as you all are to see us, I promise we're twice as excited to see these beers.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I forgot the paper Yacht is backstage, is that going to be a problem?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh no!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
So ruined.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Like Chilean Meyers emerging.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm not going to kill it.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
This is my brother, I'm going to make you a show from the Bajoran era.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
And I'm your sweet, pain-y man, Griffin McElroy.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Can I get a shout?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Can I get a shout for the Dog Pound?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
What's up, Dog Pound?

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I know what you're thinking, oh no, we got shitty seats.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You actually got great seats.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
We're not going to look at you the whole shit over.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
But every once in a while, I'll indicate to you or acknowledge that you were there.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm going to expect something back.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
A lot of love, as they say.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Now, audience one, I don't know.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Audience one, I want you to know, I want to say a lot of thanks to the Dog Pound.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
You're still number one in my heart.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Don't forget about that.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
That Justin, you can't trust that guy.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
You and me, we got something special going on.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Dog Pound, you know what I mean.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Dog Pound, yeah!

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
How are you?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
This is show number four for you.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, yeah, I crossed the river going, I'm halfway there.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
You know, it is so weird seeing what it would be like to have an actual job.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I've done something.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Yes, because doing comedy podcasts.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, sitting down and jerking off for two hours.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, man.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I can't imagine the jerking off for two hours.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
It would be really exhausting.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Unproductive.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Should we, I guess we should.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And do like what we do with the show, like questions and stuff.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, I thought we might explain that we're going to take live questions probably.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
We're going to run out of stuff to talk about.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
So start thinking of things you might want to ask us up here.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Not about poopy.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Not about poop.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Not about sleeping with your best friend's girlfriend.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Not about asking for gas money.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Cover.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Otherwise, it's a fair game.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Have fun.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Get crazy.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Get it right, because if not, you will be mocked.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
It will be bad.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
You will feel bad about yourself.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
You won't feel like all those rippers.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
They were ribbing me.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
You'll feel mocked.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
And if you guys want any of the snacks on the table,

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
feel free to just come up and grab them, because the last show brought us trinkets.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
We can't complain we got beers.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
But somebody brought like a whole thing of cheer wine from Florida that they shipped here,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
which is great.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I know.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
It's the best marriage.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Start.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Jump in.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Begin.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Go.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I just finished my shows to each degree.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
It said there to hold for applause.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Are these people that are here?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
This is Steve.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I didn't say, is Steve here?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Because I was afraid.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
Steve, what's up, Steve?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Sorry I made an art sound about your degree.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
And I'll be moving into an apartment closer to my new school this summer.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
The problem is, I don't have any life skills.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I can't cook.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
I don't know how to iron clothes.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And paying bills is a totally foreign concept to me.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Basically, I need whatever wisdom you three have on being an adult.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Steve, I want to know something, Steve.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I've got a real question for you, okay?

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
After you decided to sit in the front row, was there a moment when you were like, oh,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
man, I've got a question.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I don't know shit about shit.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm going to have to sit before a council of my elders and admit my failings five feet

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
away.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
Why isn't there like a website that's just like, when you graduate college, you get a

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
membership.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
And it's like, here's how you pay a bill.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Here's how you do another thing.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Because that's supposed to be everything leading up to that moment.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
It's fucking not, though.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
I learned all about how to measure the volume of shapes or whatever.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
But they don't teach you how to register to vote ever.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Ever.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Not once.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I learned what voting does.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
I learned all about what a bill is, but I don't know how I participate in that conversation.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
We had a life skills class where we had to create a budget, learn how to fill out a check,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
which was a lot of fun.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
We had to pick real estate from the book.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
We went to the same fucking school, right?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
We had a budget we had to live off of.

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
And you had to pick real estate, and you had to make a food list of things you're going

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
to buy for your family.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Fruit roll ups, fruit roll ups, fruit roll ups.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
And everybody in my class was picking real estate out of the book that cost like $200,000,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
$300,000.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Bolin!

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
These are some Bolin heists.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, they're Bolins.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
And even at my young age, maybe this is when I decided to deviate from the pack, I'm a

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
young age, and I was like, you dumb motherfuckers, you don't really live there.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
I bought the dandy duplex, it was called, and it cost me $20,000 imaginary dollars.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
I didn't spend one goddamn day there because I was 11.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
And I'm looking around at my fellow students like, we're 11.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You know they won't make you move into this fake house you bought with your imaginary

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
money, save it for the little debbies that you're not going to borrow with your imaginary

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
money.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
But I did.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I budgeted a lot of little debbies.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
People made fun of me for it.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
I guess because maybe I got a reputation because I brought those in my lunch every day.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
We got off-brand little debbies.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
When I took that one, I remember playing that game.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Give it up for Star Crunches, everybody.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
I remember playing that game in high school, and what happened to me was I got approved

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
for a loan for like the $200,000 house, and instead I got a $75,000 house and used the

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
rest to buy imaginary beds because I thought it was just free money.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
And then the teacher explained to me that I'd have to pay that back, and I had to petition

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
the class to let me return the 150 animals I bought.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
And as you can imagine, they were not forgiving.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You might have had it all wrong.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
You may not have had a revenue stream, but you had a zoo.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Because I had a hundred of these stray dogs.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
The worst fucking zoo ever.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
It sounds like we all sort of subscribe to the blank Czech school of economics.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah, what a bouncy castle.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I'm putting a water slide in my house.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Do you have any idea how much it costs to upkeep a bouncy castle?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
No, I don't.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Steve, learn to cook five things.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Because by the fifth day, you'll be ready to eat the first thing again.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
So anybody who knows how to cook more than five things is just showing off.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm at the point in my life where Tuesday is tostada night, and I gained a lot of security

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
from that.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
It's not as scary as I thought it would be when I was younger.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You know, it gives me a lot of comfort.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
At least there's tostadas.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
At least I have something to look forward to.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
We'll always have tostadas.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
At least I have something to look forward to.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I mean, yes.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
One brief shining moment, and it's black and white.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
I just can't put up with the new Tuesdays are coming.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Ah, sweet tostada Tuesday.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
If I can just hold out until tostadas.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
The light shines in my dark prison cell life for 15 minutes a day.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
But Tuesdays are coming.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Okay.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
I am getting a somewhat dirty look from Saltwater's co-host, Cindy Mackerel.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
So I do want to acknowledge that, yes, I do understand you're seven months pregnant.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
I am definitely looking forward to that in addition to tostada night.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Basically even though.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
Ladies, the tostadas.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
These go back and forth.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
How can you ask them to choose?

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
You can actually learn to cook really easy by buying a slow cooker.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
You put anything.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Put a bunch of shit in it.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Just put a bunch of shit in it.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
And then make rice.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And put the shit from the pot onto the rice.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Dinner is done.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
It's figured.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
That's how I make my tostadas.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Listen, everybody I'm going to let you in on both tostadas.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
See your dog pound.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
You know what's up.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
You put.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
You get chicken.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Hold on.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
So I need a pen.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I'll tell you what happens.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Chicken dinners.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Put them in a slow cooker.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
A little cumin, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
And then you dump a jar of salsa on top of it.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
On high for two hours in a slow cooker.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
You are going to have tostadas.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
So Steve, I hope that answers your question about how to make tostadas.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
How do I make tostadas?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Are you going to make one?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Perfect.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
We did great.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Good job.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Ten out of ten.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Are there white cables?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
So what else do you need help with?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Cooking is covered.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Cooking is covered.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
How to iron.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Take a hot thing and smooth it out.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
But don't do it wrong or else it will fuck it up forever.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
You just got to keep moving.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Don't wait.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Oh, ruined.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Steve, life hack.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Don't iron anything.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Hang it up in the shower.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Turn the shower on full blast.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Close the bathroom door.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Twenty minutes later everything is steaming clean.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Doesn't actually work.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
You know what's up.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
You can also just throw it in the dryer with a damp washcloth.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
It does the same thing.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
So you forgot to empty the dryer so now everything is wrinkled?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
No it's not.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Put a wet towel in there for ten minutes.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Oops.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
It's all fixed.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
This has been Steve's Life Hacks on Steam.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Because it's all this great podcast, they turn my life around and now I'm hacking your

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
life because they helped me so much pay it forward.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Are you doing okay by the way?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
In the last record setch I revealed to Justin how I'm going to pay it forward in and he

10:43.000 --> 11:06.240
said he was going to be sad for the rest of the day and I was worried about his podcast

11:06.240 --> 11:29.240
because I was going to be sad for the rest of the day and he said he was going to be

11:29.240 --> 11:34.240
sad for the rest of the day and I was worried about his podcast because I was worried about

11:34.240 --> 11:48.840
his podcast because I was worried about his podcast because I was worried about his podcast

11:48.840 --> 11:50.840
Edward Snowden's super hot.

11:50.840 --> 12:19.840
I just wanna say, wouldn't it have been mind-blowing if Edward Snowden had walked around this whole time?

12:19.840 --> 12:23.840
And that's what he sounds like, he was actually on our show, he's dangerous, I don't know.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.840
I am Edward Snowden.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.840
Oh, you're Edward Snowden.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.840
I heard I had a...secret admirer.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.840
Don't tell.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.840
I want to contact him for acquaintances.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.840
Never mind, I already know who they are.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.840
I found their secrets in the internet.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.840
What?

12:46.840 --> 12:49.840
I found their secrets in the internet.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.840
I found their secrets in the internet.

12:52.840 --> 12:58.840
Sorry, I had a frog in my throat.

12:58.840 --> 13:02.840
I love that Edward Snowden and Amelie were introduced so well.

13:02.840 --> 13:06.840
We've been like one episode of each other and now they've fused into this.

13:06.840 --> 13:07.840
We're very different.

13:07.840 --> 13:08.840
I understand you, Snowden.

13:08.840 --> 13:09.840
Sure.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.840
Copyright, copyright.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.840
Sorry, that's my bad.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.840
That guy looks more like a Hollywood actor than a CIA agent.

13:16.840 --> 13:17.840
Never mind.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.840
He likes to have hearty shmuttering.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.840
I don't even care what he does or say.

13:23.840 --> 13:28.840
I just want to tie him up and do many things to him.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.840
That's not an okay thing to say about anyone.

13:31.840 --> 13:32.840
Personally...

13:32.840 --> 13:34.840
I just want to tie him up and do stuff to him.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.840
I think if you want to tie me up, you're more fair.

13:37.840 --> 13:42.840
Well, the U.S. government has failed and no one can tie Snowden.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.840
I know the secret way to untie every knot.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.840
Hold on, hold on.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.840
They cannot tie me.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.840
Does Snowden know all secrets?

13:52.840 --> 13:55.840
I know all secrets.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.840
Ask me anything.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.840
Tell me about the secret McDonald's video.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.840
That is in the previous episode.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.840
Continuity.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.840
That's the continuity for people at home.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.840
Nobody in the theater that we're performing for right now.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.840
Personally, how do you rate his looks from 0 to 10?

14:14.840 --> 14:17.840
0 seems super fucking harsh to apply to any...

14:17.840 --> 14:20.840
That's like you don't have any body at all.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.840
When I look at your face, it's just a gray mass.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.840
It's just a blob.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.840
I'm a chevin.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.840
Strong, strong chevin.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.840
So hush, Snowden journalist.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.840
You're in the right light with your 7.5.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.840
The few cocktails.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.840
Snowden can't do real.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.840
He's not an eco maniac.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.840
You're doing all right over there.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.840
Wherever you are.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.840
They say it's Russia, but that's a false flag.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.840
That's a false flag.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.840
I'm doing fine.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.840
I would like to meet a special someone.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.840
To keep him busy?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.840
To let them meet the secrets.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.840
To enjoy the secrets.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.840
It must be really hard to...

15:05.840 --> 15:07.840
I don't know.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.840
Go on.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.840
It must be hard to find someone that will let you in.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.840
Because once they let you in...

15:15.840 --> 15:19.840
You'll hack fucking everything about them.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.840
Did you see that movie, Little Red Riding Hoodie?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.840
It was emotional.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.840
Not really.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.840
Are you a vampire?

15:28.840 --> 15:31.840
I am a vampire of secrets.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.840
For real.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.840
Right now there's a person in the audience who's looking at the person next to them.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.840
What the fuck?

15:39.840 --> 15:41.840
Why did you bring me to this, Jeff?

15:41.840 --> 15:43.840
What is this, Jeff?

15:43.840 --> 15:46.840
First the thing about the horse dissection and now this guy...

15:46.840 --> 15:48.840
What is this guy even doing?

15:48.840 --> 15:50.840
I've seen that cat on television.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.840
That's not how he sounds.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.840
I really have to pee.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.840
I can't do that.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.840
You've got to use this.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.840
Next question.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.840
I'm a professional writer.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.840
Wait, did we cover it?

16:04.840 --> 16:06.840
We covered it.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.840
Covered is Snowden Haught?

16:08.840 --> 16:10.840
Yeah, I think we covered it.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.840
I'm a professional writer.

16:12.840 --> 16:17.840
Over the years I, for the most part, developed a healthy attitude in regards to reviews and criticism.

16:17.840 --> 16:25.840
But last November, a comic mini-series I wrote got a scathing review from a Mr. Clint McElroy.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.840
Why would he...

16:29.840 --> 16:31.840
And it haunts me still.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.840
Why would he put this in the show?

16:33.840 --> 16:37.840
How do I deal with criticism from your dad?

16:37.840 --> 16:43.840
And that's where Chris Hastings...

16:43.840 --> 16:45.840
Chris, are you here?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.840
Hi, Chris.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.840
Yeah, I don't think so.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.840
Travis is the host.

16:51.840 --> 16:55.840
Travis takes the hostess pose like her dad.

16:55.840 --> 17:01.840
Listen, Chris, if you figure out how to deal with criticism from my dad, I hope you won't let me down.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.840
Can you even get our dad off your job for a second?

17:05.840 --> 17:07.840
Dad's not here yet, right?

17:07.840 --> 17:09.840
No, en route.

17:09.840 --> 17:11.840
En route, as they say.

17:11.840 --> 17:15.840
He was texting a lot of pictures of himself driving, so we'll see if...

17:15.840 --> 17:23.840
You know, who the fuck is he?

17:23.840 --> 17:29.840
What's he done with his life that's so great?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.840
I mean, us.

17:31.840 --> 17:37.840
God, that's a toughie, because normally you'd just be like, fuck that guy.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.840
Or like, whatever.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.840
Or like, live your life.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.840
He's our dad.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.840
Maybe you should just listen to him.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.840
Maybe it was like, weak.

17:49.840 --> 17:53.840
Not weak, but maybe it had elements that could be polished on down.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.840
Like a bump sign chair.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.840
Like a bumpy chair?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.840
Was your comic like a bumpy chair?

17:59.840 --> 18:03.840
Maybe you should just listen to our dad, whatever he said.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.840
How odd.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.840
Great points now.

18:07.840 --> 18:11.840
This is a man who thought Man from Hunkle was a really sweet show.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.840
You know what you could do?

18:13.840 --> 18:17.840
You could criticize his comic books that he made.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.840
And really turn the tables on him.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.840
If you could find the comic adaptation of Freejack...

18:21.840 --> 18:23.840
He fucking ghost wrote that, you can't say that out loud.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.840
Oh, shit.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.840
I'll say the comic of Universal Soldier.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.840
If you find the comic adaptation of Universal Soldier...

18:31.840 --> 18:33.840
Was that also ghost written?

18:33.840 --> 18:35.840
That was Clint McElroy's drawing.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.840
We gotta fucking edit...

18:37.840 --> 18:39.840
None of you can tell...

18:39.840 --> 18:41.840
We're fucked.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.840
What else?

18:43.840 --> 18:45.840
What else can't we tell them about?

18:45.840 --> 18:49.840
Well, he made Green Hornet Dark Tomorrow, which was the alternate universe Green Hornet.

18:49.840 --> 18:53.840
Where Green Hornet was of Asian descent and Kato was white.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.840
And that was the only choice.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.840
That was like how he put this script?

18:57.840 --> 18:59.840
No, that was just one of the things that was in the thing.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.840
And he did one about vampire hunters?

19:01.840 --> 19:03.840
Blood is the Harvest.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.840
I guarantee you can have some weak shit in Blood is the Harvest.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.840
The title of it is Blood is the Harvest.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.840
Yes, right there.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.840
That was not his title.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.840
It was about two vampire bounty hunters named Deep and Wide.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.840
And I'm pretty sure he was gonna go with that.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.840
Fuck you guys.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.840
This is a pretty good comic book.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.840
Who the fuck are you?

19:23.840 --> 19:25.840
Who the fuck are you?

19:25.840 --> 19:27.840
Where's your comic book?

19:27.840 --> 19:29.840
Not you Chris, but the rest of us.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.840
Where's your comics?

19:31.840 --> 19:33.840
Dick shits.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.840
Talk about my dad.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.840
You're real confrontational.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.840
You're real excited.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.840
Real excited.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.840
It's gonna be like Lenny Bruce shit in here.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.840
The guy seemed angry at me.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.840
Is that Bill Hitz? No, it's me.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.840
It's all to my dad.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.840
I'm trying to remember if my dad's ever like genuinely criticized us for shit before.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.840
No, dad's problem is always he's too supportive.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.840
So he would say like, yeah, you can be active.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.840
You're great at football.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.840
Fucking sober not great at football.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.840
I guarantee.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
You try to stick with wrestling, it's gonna take off.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.840
Didn't ever really see that.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.840
Justin, you good enough at acting that you should spend your college career majoring in acting?

20:11.840 --> 20:13.840
What's four years?

20:13.840 --> 20:15.840
This is the craziest thing.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.840
I remember in high school, dad saying it's too bad you gave up on wrestling.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.840
Because now with your Bill, now?

20:19.840 --> 20:21.840
You'd be so good.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.840
For half of a second, I would go, hey.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.840
And I'd go, oh no, wait, right.

20:25.840 --> 20:29.840
I wrestled two years and never won a single match.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.840
So maybe it's just a no.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.840
Then you wrestle like a sickly boy.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.840
I beat a kid with a flu once.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.840
But I count that as a tie.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.840
Really?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.840
Did you get the flu afterwards?

20:45.840 --> 20:47.840
No, I didn't, so I guess I win.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.840
Next question.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.840
How about you?

20:51.840 --> 20:53.840
Please.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
Which one of these are we gonna have?

20:55.840 --> 20:57.840
That one.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.840
Yeah, do it.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.840
This one's sent in by Ira Ray.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.840
Are you Ira Ray?

21:03.840 --> 21:05.840
Who wants to know?

21:05.840 --> 21:07.840
Fucking yeah!

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
You nailed it.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.840
You nailed it.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
Don Power, I didn't know if you guys did it or not.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.840
I wasn't looking at you, did you?

21:15.840 --> 21:17.840
Perfect.

21:17.840 --> 21:21.840
This was sent in by, or was asked by Jane2000.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.840
Who asked?

21:23.840 --> 21:25.840
Min.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.840
Oh, God.

21:27.840 --> 21:33.840
I just bumped a girl as an excuse to touch her.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.840
Awesome, awesome.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.840
Great, great, great, great.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.840
Cool life, cool life you have.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.840
You can't hug, yet it's too much.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.840
And shaking hands is too formal.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.840
Is it an excuse to touch a girl?

21:45.840 --> 21:51.840
We're the worst.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.840
We're the fucking worst.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.840
Just dudes?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.840
Here's the thing, though.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.840
Dude, are there any dudes in here today?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.840
No, they're all quiet.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.840
I don't know.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.840
This seems like a trap.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.840
Good instinct, dudes.

22:07.840 --> 22:11.840
There has to be at least one dude, though, that has like,

22:11.840 --> 22:13.840
Hey, this is my girl.

22:13.840 --> 22:17.840
Never watch this.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.840
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.840
Her knuckles are so soft.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
Give me a petri dish.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.840
Fuck, this is just the worst.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.840
I don't have anything to say about this except it's the worst.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.840
I'm sorry.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.840
Oh, wait, hold on.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.840
I mean, so many answers.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.840
All the time, it gets my heart pounding.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.840
Yahoo Answers, take action against this user immediately.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.840
Where are the moderators?

22:41.840 --> 22:43.840
Just swoop in like Batman.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.840
No, too creepy.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.840
Get out.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.840
You've been bounced from Yahoo.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.840
If you get bounced from Yahoo Answers for being too creepy,

22:51.840 --> 22:53.840
do you even like move into the woods or something?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.840
Because you may not.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.840
Don't do that.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.840
Fellas.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.840
How do you sleep at night?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.840
Touching is so overrated, you know?

23:03.840 --> 23:07.840
Yeah, I'd rather just yell at a girl from a car.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.840
If you have to say...

23:09.840 --> 23:15.840
I'm just trying to make a connection.

23:15.840 --> 23:19.840
If you ever have to say the words in sequence,

23:19.840 --> 23:23.840
excuse to touch someone.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.840
You fucked up somewhere along the way.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.840
Yeah, somewhere by the haywire.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.840
Because they'll know.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.840
Oh, no.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.840
You can tell from a fist bump of somebody that wants to touch you,

23:33.840 --> 23:37.840
it will creep you out through your fists.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
And I guarantee you,

23:39.840 --> 23:41.840
any woman who has ever had that trick pulled on her

23:41.840 --> 23:45.840
has had this expression on her face.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
To be fair, I feel like that's how anyone should react

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
when someone goes, fist bump?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
Yeah.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
You want to punch my face?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.840
Because it's not 1971 anymore.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.840
I feel like any fist bump or high five,

23:57.840 --> 23:59.840
I actually extend this to high five,

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
where you have to say,

24:01.840 --> 24:03.840
what is going to happen to me in this?

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
Hey Pat, let me have this with you.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
No, it's got to be...

24:07.840 --> 24:09.840
You will know when it's time to high five,

24:09.840 --> 24:11.840
and both people will know.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.840
They will understand that a high five is coming.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
This situation calls for it.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.840
If you say it aloud, you are forced to say it.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.840
No question.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
But it could be a courtesy thing,

24:21.840 --> 24:23.840
because what if you go for a five and they go for a bump?

24:23.840 --> 24:25.840
You smack them in the face.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.840
High five.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.840
And you punch me in the stomach.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.840
We're not friends anymore.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.840
But I didn't get to touch you.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
You got to give me that.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.840
Because the other side of that is

24:37.840 --> 24:39.840
if anyone ever fist bumped and the girl went,

24:39.840 --> 24:41.840
now I'm in love with this boy.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.840
I felt that magic spark.

24:43.840 --> 24:47.840
Sorry to interrupt you live Justin.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.840
Great spoofs, us.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.840
We are nailing it.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.840
We are...

24:53.840 --> 24:55.840
This is so funny.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.840
Actually, this was the second one?

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
Yeah, this was the weakest one.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.840
No, I thought the next one was the weakest.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.840
You all got some dog shit to look forward to though.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.840
No, I'm just kidding.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.840
They were all decent.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.840
Thank you all for coming to those New York Shorts.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.840
And thank you to everybody who came out to the LA Life Show.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.840
We're going to be parsing these out a little bit

25:13.840 --> 25:15.840
because we got travel plans and we don't want to go...

25:15.840 --> 25:17.840
Babies coming.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.840
Babies coming. We don't want to go a week without an episode.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.840
So we're spacing these out.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.840
We'll probably have another regular episode next week.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.840
Sorry about the audio quality on this one.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.840
I know it's not ideal, but we did our best.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.840
The LA Life Show should be good though.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.840
Should be so nice.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.840
Let's get paid maybe?

25:33.840 --> 25:35.840
Let's get paid at the Money Zone.

25:35.840 --> 25:39.840
I know you've probably tried Hulu on your computer

25:39.840 --> 25:41.840
sitting at your desk

25:41.840 --> 25:43.840
while the boss is looking over your shoulder.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.840
But it doesn't have to be a secret thing.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.840
Why would the boss be looking...

25:47.840 --> 25:49.840
If the boss was looking over your shoulder

25:49.840 --> 25:51.840
at you watching Hulu, he would be very upset.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.840
The boss is looking over your shoulder

25:53.840 --> 25:55.840
because he missed South Park.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.840
Okay.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.840
Sounds like a pretty cool boss.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.840
Yeah, he is a cool boss.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.840
But you don't have to just do that.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.840
There's something more than that.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.840
You can take your relationship to a deeper,

26:07.840 --> 26:09.840
bettering level with Hulu Plus.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.840
That's like Hulu,

26:11.840 --> 26:13.840
but it makes Hulu look like dog shit.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.840
Whoa, don't say that.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.840
Whoa, come on.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.840
It's much better than Hulu.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.840
You can watch an insane amount of television.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.840
Parks and Recreation is on there.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.840
Here's one.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.840
Fox canceled my hit TV series,

26:29.840 --> 26:31.840
I Want to Marry Harry.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.840
You son of a bitch.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.840
How could you watch this?

26:35.840 --> 26:37.840
But Hulu's like, give us your poor,

26:37.840 --> 26:39.840
give us your tired, give us your hungry.

26:39.840 --> 26:43.840
We'll put that whole series up online.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.840
No problemo.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.840
There's like a billion seasons of Survivor

26:47.840 --> 26:49.840
and Amazing Race we've been digging through.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.840
They just added Top Chef too.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.840
Nice.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.840
Block off a day to binge.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.840
Get in there, watch it all for eight bucks a month.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.840
Anytime, anywhere.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.840
iPad, Roku,

27:01.840 --> 27:03.840
Xbox, whatever.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.840
Goku from Dragon Ball Z.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.840
There are over 9,000 TV programs on Hulu.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.840
Vegeta.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.840
Gohan.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.840
Super Saiyan Gohan.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.840
I mentioned eight bucks a month.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.840
That's actually not for you.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.840
You're too special for that.

27:21.840 --> 27:25.840
You are gonna get a two week free test run.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.840
Piccolo.

27:27.840 --> 27:31.840
If you go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother,

27:31.840 --> 27:35.840
we're gonna get you two weeks of access completely free.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.840
You can try it out, watch a bunch of shows,

27:37.840 --> 27:39.840
and then realize that your life has been missing

27:39.840 --> 27:41.840
this entire time.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.840
That's HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.840
Man, that was a great ad, Griffin.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.840
We're gonna have a lot of fucking sweet money

27:51.840 --> 27:53.840
coming in from that.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.840
Frankly, I don't know what to do with it.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
Yeah, they're gonna pay us a lot of extra money

27:57.840 --> 27:59.840
because of how fucking sweet a job we do

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
at HuluPlus.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.840
I have an idea, though.

28:03.840 --> 28:05.840
I think we should go to Simple

28:05.840 --> 28:07.840
because Simple's apparently the best bank ever.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.840
It's the way banking should be.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.840
They took banking and they said,

28:11.840 --> 28:13.840
this thing's fundamentally fucked.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.840
Let's start over, start from scratch.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.840
Imagine, if you will, a checking account

28:17.840 --> 28:19.840
with no minimum balance, no monthly fee,

28:19.840 --> 28:21.840
no overdraft charge.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.840
No fucking checks.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.840
No fucking checks.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.840
55,000 fee-free ATMs.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.840
You can deposit checks with a photo

28:29.840 --> 28:31.840
and you can spend without it being stressful

28:31.840 --> 28:33.840
and terrible.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.840
Money can be fun again.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.840
Fun money.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.840
Thank God.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.840
Money is back.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.840
Money is back in a big way for 2014.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.840
People thought I got done with money for a while,

28:45.840 --> 28:47.840
but money is back.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.840
Money, Simple lets you save automatically

28:49.840 --> 28:51.840
so you can tell it I have a goal

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
and it will help you reach that goal

28:53.840 --> 28:55.840
because it cares about you

28:55.840 --> 28:57.840
and it wants you to be happy.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.840
Just like Gohan helped Goku reach his goal

28:59.840 --> 29:01.840
of becoming the ultimate Super Saiyan warrior.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.840
I don't think we can do that.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.840
Okay.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.840
Simple.com, you know what was nice?

29:07.840 --> 29:09.840
I'm a Simple customer myself.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.840
I signed up and I sent a message to them

29:11.840 --> 29:13.840
because I had a question

29:13.840 --> 29:15.840
and they just responded in the app.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.840
It was not even a big deal.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.840
They just chatted right back with me.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.840
It's super nice.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.840
They can pay your bills.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.840
It's like a real bank.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.840
They're not just going to take your money

29:27.840 --> 29:29.840
and put it in their butts

29:29.840 --> 29:31.840
and then fly to Cuba or something.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
The thing is so popular

29:33.840 --> 29:35.840
that there's a waitlist right now,

29:35.840 --> 29:37.840
but we can help you get past it.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.840
How can we do that?

29:39.840 --> 29:41.840
Simple.com slash my brother.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.840
Go there.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.840
Go get your banking right.

29:45.840 --> 29:49.840
Wait till you get your money right with Simple.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.840
That's the new thing I've been working on for them.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.840
The jingles are back also in a big way,

29:53.840 --> 29:55.840
just like money.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.840
Hey, Jacqueline.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.840
Jacqueline.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.840
Yes, you Jacqueline.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.840
Got a message for you from Brendan

30:03.840 --> 30:05.840
who says,

30:05.840 --> 30:07.840
Hey, Jacqueline.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.840
You sure did graduate, didn't you?

30:09.840 --> 30:11.840
By the time this reaches you,

30:11.840 --> 30:13.840
we'll be living in a sweet new house.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.840
I'm so stupid lucky to be able

30:15.840 --> 30:17.840
to come home to you all the time.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.840
So much love.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.840
That's usually what we think

30:21.840 --> 30:23.840
is something funny to say here,

30:23.840 --> 30:25.840
but that just sounds like a nice situation

30:25.840 --> 30:27.840
you have going on over there.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.840
Jacqueline, you're nailing it.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.840
Jacqueline's doing really good.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
Got a sweet,

30:33.840 --> 30:35.840
I don't know the nature of the relationship,

30:35.840 --> 30:37.840
but I'm just going to say lover.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.840
Got a sweet lover in Brendan.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.840
Got a new diploma.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.840
Got a new house.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.840
I bet it's a real big,

30:45.840 --> 30:47.840
maybe like 2600 square foot ranch style house

30:47.840 --> 30:49.840
Oh, that sounds like a white picket fence.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.840
White picket fence.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
Somewhere that's green.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
Got another message for Will.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.840
Congratulations, Jacqueline.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.840
Yes, so proud.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.840
Got a message from Will Lilspoon Barley.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.840
Love it.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.840
That's Will Lilspoon Barley

31:05.840 --> 31:07.840
from Jeff and Jesse.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.840
Presumably they're the big spoons.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.840
Congratulations.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
One of them has to be the biggest spoon, right?

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
One of them is the largest.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.840
One of them is the soup spoon.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.840
Congratulations to Dr. William Lilspoon Barley

31:19.840 --> 31:21.840
on receiving his Ph.D.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.840
Will channeled the power of his favorite

31:23.840 --> 31:25.840
warrior cat Bramblepelt

31:25.840 --> 31:27.840
to finish his dissertation.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.840
Thanks to the Brothers McElroy

31:29.840 --> 31:31.840
for helping Will become a fake doctor.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.840
Starting this fall, he'll be a professor

31:33.840 --> 31:35.840
at the University of Illinois,

31:35.840 --> 31:37.840
so might provide some future

31:37.840 --> 31:39.840
farm wisdom.

31:39.840 --> 31:41.840
I have so many questions

31:41.840 --> 31:43.840
about his whole scene.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.840
Did he get like a Ph.D.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.840
in agriculture?

31:47.840 --> 31:49.840
Yeah, I think maybe there was a missing bit

31:49.840 --> 31:51.840
of information there that would

31:51.840 --> 31:53.840
inform that, because I don't know

31:53.840 --> 31:55.840
why being a professor

31:55.840 --> 31:57.840
in Illinois would inherently

31:57.840 --> 31:59.840
make it,

31:59.840 --> 32:01.840
you know, make you more likely

32:01.840 --> 32:03.840
to come up with farm wisdom.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.840
I think if you're in the agriculture business

32:05.840 --> 32:07.840
and your last name is Barley,

32:07.840 --> 32:09.840
that's a pretty fucking good start.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.840
Yeah, you're like halfway there.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.840
I'm Dr. Jack Carrot.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.840
My name is Dr. Jack Carrot.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.840
Hi, I'm Dr. Jack Lettuce, and I'm here to

32:17.840 --> 32:19.840
teach you about how to get

32:19.840 --> 32:21.840
sweet vegetables from the ground.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.840
The top gains. I'm gonna blow out your lettuce

32:23.840 --> 32:25.840
with sweet gains.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.840
I'm also the creator of Farmville.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.840
So, congratulations, William.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.840
And thank you for listening to our program.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.840
And now we're gonna head back

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
to live us

32:35.840 --> 32:37.840
and Travis

32:37.840 --> 32:39.840
back when he was alive.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.840
I miss him.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.840
Miss you, sweet boy.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.840
Uh...

32:45.840 --> 32:47.840
I need a fucking palette cleanser is what I need.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.840
Does anyone in the audience

32:49.840 --> 32:51.840
have a question?

32:51.840 --> 32:53.840
Yeah, come on down.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.840
Do you remember the criteria?

32:55.840 --> 32:57.840
We explicitly outlined the criteria.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.840
Do you understand the fucking dangerous game

32:59.840 --> 33:01.840
you're playing?

33:01.840 --> 33:03.840
Every time you call someone up, it is the scariest...

33:03.840 --> 33:05.840
It's the most dangerous game.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.840
It will get savage.

33:07.840 --> 33:09.840
Hey, guys.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.840
We will savage you if you fuck this up.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.840
No pressure.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
Now, don't be shy. Get up close to the mic.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.840
Yeah, I actually did get up close.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.840
Okay, too close.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.840
So, my roommate and I just moved in to a new place.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.840
Okay.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.840
And we found the last person's checkbook.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.840
Oh!

33:27.840 --> 33:29.840
Actually, you found Will!

33:29.840 --> 33:31.840
You've come to the right place.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.840
How much do I take?

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
Oh, my God.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.840
Okay.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.840
Whoa, criminal!

33:39.840 --> 33:41.840
I thought the question was going to be like,

33:41.840 --> 33:43.840
what's the easiest way to get back to them?

33:43.840 --> 33:45.840
Is there information on this checkbook?

33:45.840 --> 33:47.840
I can use to locate this person.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.840
Here's the thing. You're going to need to write $1,000,000.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.840
I didn't get your name.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.840
Sam.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.840
Okay, so you're going to blank check it, right?

33:55.840 --> 33:57.840
Yeah, right.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.840
Let me figure this out.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.840
Just write $1,000,000,000.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
Okay, here's what I want you to do.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.840
Give another friend.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.840
Sit on their shoulders.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.840
Put a checkbook on them.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.840
And go to the bank.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.840
I'm a nice little tall man with a very big heart.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.840
I'd like to withdraw $1,000,000,000.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.840
Please.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.840
I think you're in prison for fraud.

34:19.840 --> 34:23.840
I would like to turn this into this mini, please.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.840
Hello, I'm a grown up.

34:25.840 --> 34:29.840
And I would like to exchange this for a deposit half.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.840
Yes, my name?

34:31.840 --> 34:33.840
Herschel?

34:33.840 --> 34:35.840
Grown up.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.840
That's me.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.840
Can you ransom the checkbook off?

34:39.840 --> 34:41.840
That's the thing.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.840
Don't write any checks because that's illegal.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.840
But ransom is...

34:45.840 --> 34:47.840
You can sell it to...

34:47.840 --> 34:49.840
You're not a bad person.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.840
You're not going to write a bad check.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.840
But you could sell it to a worse person.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.840
You seem like the kids.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.840
$30, please.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.840
You could also just make the check out

34:59.840 --> 35:01.840
for a non-money denomination.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.840
But try to cash this person's check for like one hug.

35:05.840 --> 35:09.840
And then the video goes viral.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.840
I don't have that sense.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.840
This man asked for a hug with a check.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.840
You won't believe what happened next.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.840
He didn't get it.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.840
He did not get it.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.840
He was arrested.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.840
That's not how checks work.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.840
You're just looking for an excuse to touch me.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.840
Nice try.

35:27.840 --> 35:31.840
I turned you down for a Facebook video.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.840
Why do you think...

35:33.840 --> 35:35.840
Let's have a...

35:35.840 --> 35:37.840
Here, let's go less answer, more intervention.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.840
Okay.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.840
Don't commit this crime.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.840
Sam, no.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.840
Sam, everything is working for you right now.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.840
You got a room and a place to live.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.840
You can't jeopardize your future like this.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.840
Let me throw this out.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.840
Take these checks.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.840
Make a framed collage.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.840
They're just account numbers.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.840
When friends come over, you want all yours.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.840
You can use whatever you want.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.840
Take the account information.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.840
You're saying you give these checks out like party check.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.840
Yeah, you just hand them out.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.840
Let them tear one off as they leave.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.840
Here's your check.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.840
Rather than being the victim of identity theft,

36:13.840 --> 36:15.840
you want them to be caught in some sort of

36:15.840 --> 36:17.840
insane psychosexual web

36:17.840 --> 36:19.840
where hundreds of strangers

36:19.840 --> 36:21.840
have access to their checking account.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.840
That'll be more palatable.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.840
How do I monetize that, though?

36:25.840 --> 36:27.840
That's a fucking fine question, Sam.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.840
It's not a question.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.840
It's not even a question.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.840
It's a paper chase.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.840
Life is so much bigger than forged checks.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.840
There's so much more out there for you than that.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.840
You could go through,

36:39.840 --> 36:41.840
if they balance their book,

36:41.840 --> 36:43.840
you could look at all the purchases they made

36:43.840 --> 36:45.840
and then go out in the world and make all those purchases

36:45.840 --> 36:47.840
and win a day in their lives.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.840
And just tally Mr. Ripley up.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.840
Yeah.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.840
Well, spoilers.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.840
In a way.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.840
Sam, thank you so much for joining us.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.840
Do we have any more?

37:05.840 --> 37:07.840
More questions?

37:07.840 --> 37:09.840
We've got a hot question right here.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.840
Come on up.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.840
This is favoritism.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.840
Hey, how's it going?

37:15.840 --> 37:17.840
My name is Brent.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.840
Hi, Brent.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.840
Well, I have a little big problem

37:21.840 --> 37:23.840
and a little big problem.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.840
It sounds like the audience is angry.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.840
They sound like they're saying, oh.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.840
I get it.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.840
Small problem.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.840
You know the criteria.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.840
Yeah, I do.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.840
Small problem and a big problem.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.840
Small problem, I could really use a Pepsi Max.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.840
That's the first problem we've ever solved!

37:41.840 --> 37:43.840
Yeah!

37:43.840 --> 37:45.840
Yeah!

37:45.840 --> 37:47.840
Yeah!

37:47.840 --> 37:49.840
Big problem.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.840
I have a magically cute dog.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.840
Now let me explain.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.840
This dog needs exercise.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.840
He's five months old.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.840
He needs to expend the energy

37:59.840 --> 38:01.840
so he's not aggressive around the house.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.840
He's magically cute.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.840
I can't make it one block

38:05.840 --> 38:07.840
without the foot traffic of New York City

38:07.840 --> 38:09.840
stopping to make a comment

38:09.840 --> 38:11.840
and make me feel obligated to not keep walking

38:11.840 --> 38:13.840
because he's so fucking cute.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.840
What do I do?

38:15.840 --> 38:17.840
I make either myself or my dog

38:17.840 --> 38:19.840
more standoffish

38:19.840 --> 38:21.840
or more unapproachable.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.840
You're doing it great.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.840
Thank you.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.840
Come on, we're pals.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.840
Wait, it's fine.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.840
We're going to have to ugly your dog up.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.840
Can you buy the dog Uggs?

38:33.840 --> 38:35.840
Like mini Uggs?

38:35.840 --> 38:37.840
You understand that Ugg

38:37.840 --> 38:39.840
doesn't stand for ugly, right?

38:39.840 --> 38:41.840
Women don't wear Uggs

38:41.840 --> 38:43.840
to be like, I need to ugly myself up

38:43.840 --> 38:45.840
and stop trying to fist bump.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.840
I don't know, have you ever seen Uggs?

38:47.840 --> 38:49.840
I got to go to the bathroom.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.840
Holy shit, it's actually happening.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.840
Brent, you want to hop in here?

38:53.840 --> 38:55.840
No way.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.840
You can advise yourself.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.840
This is my friend.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.840
We've done a bunch of live shows.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.840
I thought, what if I have to pee

39:03.840 --> 39:05.840
in the middle of a live show?

39:05.840 --> 39:07.840
You got to make sure Brent's there.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.840
Pressure's on.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.840
Pack your bags, move away.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.840
I don't care.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.840
His question was boring.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.840
I just want the Pepsi Max.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.840
The Yahoo answer.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.840
I got to say, this is kind of weird.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.840
Totally.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.840
It's asked by Jacob Locker.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.840
What are you going to do when Justin gets back?

39:27.840 --> 39:29.840
Just sigh and walk away.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.840
Thank you, Jacob Locker.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.840
It's asked by Yahoo.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.840
She has 1%.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.840
According to this,

39:37.840 --> 39:39.840
Are you sad for someone on Yahoo?

39:39.840 --> 39:43.840
She has negative 47 points this week.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.840
It's a bad week for Jim.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.840
She should find a different social media platform.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.840
Fuck, he's already back.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.840
This has been a pleasure, you guys.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.840
See you later.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.840
Do you want to talk about it?

40:05.840 --> 40:07.840
Not much to say, my man.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.840
Just to catch you up,

40:09.840 --> 40:11.840
We're doing a Yahoo answer.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.840
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.840
It's asked by Yahoo answer.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.840
Then we made some jokes about

40:17.840 --> 40:19.840
She's not very good at Yahoo answers.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.840
Then everybody laughed.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.840
It was a really great moment.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.840
Is this like that bit in That Thing You Do?

40:25.840 --> 40:27.840
It's really clicking with this new guy.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.840
We did.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.840
You already did with That Thing You Do bit.

40:31.840 --> 40:37.840
What if my fiancé gets an erection during our ceremony?

40:41.840 --> 40:43.840
I am 35 and my fiancé is 38.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.840
Wait, hold on. Stop.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.840
I'm going to stop you right there.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.840
Why do their ages come into play in this class?

40:49.840 --> 40:51.840
Before we go on,

40:51.840 --> 40:53.840
I want to talk about erections and our ages.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.840
I thought I liked 35.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.840
Erectioned out.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.840
I did.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.840
I am 35 and my fiancé is 38.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.840
Our wedding is set for October.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.840
Okay, here's the issue.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.840
I love that.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.840
Here's some groundwork.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.840
Now let's go.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.840
He gets erections very easily.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.840
I am not complaining.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.840
I can't believe you have such a low Yahoo score.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.840
This is a very titillating question.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.840
Was there no wink? No winky face?

41:33.840 --> 41:35.840
No, there's not.

41:35.840 --> 41:39.840
But I have to admit, it feels like I am dating a teenage boy sometimes.

41:39.840 --> 41:41.840
Even if he just holds my hand,

41:41.840 --> 41:45.840
he will often sport a noticeable erection.

41:45.840 --> 41:47.840
So she's checking.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.840
It's kind of unavoidable.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.840
It can be a little awkward not to mention

41:53.840 --> 41:55.840
when he walks around the house naked sporting one.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.840
Okay, that live part was fucking unnecessary.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.840
It was pretty bad.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.840
I didn't cut that out for the event.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.840
I am just wondering how to handle this

42:03.840 --> 42:05.840
at the wedding and reception.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.840
He is nervous too. Any tips?

42:07.840 --> 42:09.840
I am just worried.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.840
When he gets all the erections.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.840
It can take a long time for it to go down.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.840
I am sure people will snicker and take pictures.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.840
Which would be good for him.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.840
Ow! A nice boner, Jerry!

42:19.840 --> 42:21.840
Quick, quick!

42:21.840 --> 42:23.840
You hurt everyone!

42:23.840 --> 42:25.840
Jerry's boner!

42:25.840 --> 42:27.840
Idiot!

42:27.840 --> 42:29.840
Meemaw, did you see his boner?

42:29.840 --> 42:31.840
Jerry, you idiot!

42:37.840 --> 42:39.840
All I can think is that it sounds like

42:39.840 --> 42:41.840
this is a pretty defining characteristic.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.840
Yeah.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.840
Anyone at the wedding is going to be surprised.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.840
Meemaw is like, oh no, it's his boner.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.840
Yeah, we all know.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.840
What are you going to do?

42:51.840 --> 42:53.840
I am going to be honest.

42:53.840 --> 42:55.840
The ceremony wasn't perfect.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.840
But it felt like you.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.840
If he didn't get a boner,

42:59.840 --> 43:01.840
we will be like, who's wedding is this?

43:01.840 --> 43:03.840
It was your story.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.840
It was your story.

43:05.840 --> 43:07.840
Your story wasn't, you look beautiful.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.840
And Jerry had a boner.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.840
I noticed that's what rocked

43:11.840 --> 43:13.840
the hardest don.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.840
His don was hard.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.840
That's your truth.

43:17.840 --> 43:19.840
I thought it was so fun

43:19.840 --> 43:21.840
the groundwork to

43:21.840 --> 43:23.840
maintain.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.840
But it doesn't matter.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.840
It didn't stop that.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.840
The surface of the boner

43:29.840 --> 43:31.840
just ripped right through that comfort bone.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.840
You know the beast is loose.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.840
Your hair looked perfect.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.840
His vows.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.840
The vows of the boner also.

43:41.840 --> 43:43.840
I did want to mention again,

43:43.840 --> 43:45.840
we all had a great time.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.840
Listen.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.840
You are going to kiss,

43:49.840 --> 43:51.840
assumedly, at the end of the ceremony

43:51.840 --> 43:53.840
there's a smooch.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.840
And if touching hands, if fist bumping your wife

43:55.840 --> 43:57.840
is enough to take the bones out.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.840
Like a smooch?

43:59.840 --> 44:01.840
Wait, hold on. There's a bigger problem

44:01.840 --> 44:03.840
here that this man needs to live his life

44:03.840 --> 44:05.840
like the boy in the bubble.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.840
Like any physical contact.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.840
You know what I mean?

44:09.840 --> 44:11.840
Maybe he just needs to live at home.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.840
I was happy he was getting married.

44:13.840 --> 44:15.840
Because it takes a very certain kind of person

44:15.840 --> 44:17.840
and that's the one.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.840
Yes, forever.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.840
That's fantastic.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.840
Well, she's not complaining.

44:23.840 --> 44:25.840
She listened.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.840
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

44:27.840 --> 44:29.840
Or the super just awesome boner.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.840
Yeah, that'd be rough, man.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.840
I don't really have any questions about horses.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.840
It's weird, right?

44:39.840 --> 44:41.840
It is weird.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.840
Does anyone here own a horse?

44:43.840 --> 44:45.840
I want to talk about it.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.840
Like owning a horse in town?

44:47.840 --> 44:49.840
Has anyone here touched a horse?

44:51.840 --> 44:53.840
Dog pound?

44:53.840 --> 44:55.840
You ever touch a horse?

44:55.840 --> 44:57.840
Tell us what horses feel like.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.840
Is that what we're doing?

44:59.840 --> 45:01.840
It's our new segment.

45:01.840 --> 45:03.840
What do horses feel like?

45:05.840 --> 45:07.840
Are you ready?

45:07.840 --> 45:09.840
I've been saving this one.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.840
I live in New York City, obviously.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.840
And walk anywhere.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.840
Because nobody would come from out of the city

45:15.840 --> 45:17.840
to see his show.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.840
Who came from an hour away?

45:23.840 --> 45:25.840
This is fun.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.840
Raise your hand.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.840
Who came from two hours away?

45:31.840 --> 45:33.840
I think in New York everything is two hours away.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.840
Three hours?

45:35.840 --> 45:37.840
Three hours?

45:37.840 --> 45:39.840
Four?

45:39.840 --> 45:41.840
Three and a half?

45:41.840 --> 45:43.840
Four?

45:43.840 --> 45:45.840
Five?

45:45.840 --> 45:47.840
How long do we make this game?

45:47.840 --> 45:49.840
Anyone, six hours.

45:49.840 --> 45:51.840
Find me after the show

45:51.840 --> 45:53.840
and I'll give you one item from my wallet.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.840
I live in New York City

45:59.840 --> 46:01.840
and walk anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours a day

46:01.840 --> 46:03.840
thanks to my community.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.840
No matter what kind of shoes I'm wearing,

46:05.840 --> 46:07.840
socks or tights,

46:07.840 --> 46:09.840
I have bits of city grit in my shoes,

46:09.840 --> 46:11.840
annoying me until I can find a discrete moment

46:11.840 --> 46:13.840
to clean them out.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.840
The worst is when I get stuck in a situation

46:15.840 --> 46:17.840
where it's not socially acceptable

46:17.840 --> 46:19.840
for hours on end to escape and rectify the situation.

46:19.840 --> 46:21.840
It happens most often with my dress shoes,

46:21.840 --> 46:23.840
so I'm frequently stuck

46:23.840 --> 46:25.840
in a work meeting or at a fancy event

46:25.840 --> 46:27.840
with bits of debris

46:27.840 --> 46:29.840
making me nuts with every step.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.840
Does this happen to everyone?

46:31.840 --> 46:33.840
Is New York City just extra grimy?

46:33.840 --> 46:35.840
Am I just bad at wearing shoes?

46:35.840 --> 46:37.840
What can I do to help?

46:37.840 --> 46:39.840
And that's from Barefoot in Brooklyn.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.840
Are you here?

46:41.840 --> 46:43.840
Do you have shit in your shoes right now?

46:43.840 --> 46:45.840
Is that why you almost fell down?

46:45.840 --> 46:47.840
Dump your shoe grit on our table.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.840
Let us examine this.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.840
We'll find an origin point for each.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.840
Now, not you, but everybody else who lives in New York,

46:53.840 --> 46:55.840
please raise your hand if this is an issue.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.840
No, clap!

46:57.840 --> 46:59.840
People at home can't hear hands raised.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.840
There were approximately 18 hands.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.840
So this is the thing.

47:03.840 --> 47:05.840
You have come to the wrong place.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.840
I don't know.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.840
The only thing we worry about getting in our shoes

47:09.840 --> 47:11.840
at West Virginia is four-leaf clovers

47:11.840 --> 47:13.840
or friendly smiles.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.840
I mean, it's a very different world.

47:15.840 --> 47:17.840
A mess.

47:17.840 --> 47:19.840
A mess.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.840
A light mess.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.840
A missile of a mess.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.840
I feel like in New York

47:25.840 --> 47:27.840
they could build

47:27.840 --> 47:29.840
on every other street

47:29.840 --> 47:31.840
corner

47:31.840 --> 47:33.840
like a foot-washing station

47:33.840 --> 47:35.840
and then

47:35.840 --> 47:37.840
those would work for that express purpose

47:37.840 --> 47:39.840
for maybe four minutes.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.840
And then they themselves

47:41.840 --> 47:43.840
would be so covered in grit

47:43.840 --> 47:45.840
and small rocks

47:45.840 --> 47:47.840
that you would be unable to use them

47:47.840 --> 47:49.840
for foot cleansing.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.840
This is great because I love an opportunity

47:51.840 --> 47:53.840
to come to a city

47:53.840 --> 47:55.840
and then talk shit about it.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.840
You all got dirty-ass feet!

47:57.840 --> 47:59.840
I love it.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.840
Big Apple dreams.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.840
Broadway dreams.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.840
And gross-ass feet.

48:05.840 --> 48:07.840
What are you doing?

48:07.840 --> 48:09.840
You wear boots and still just by the end of the day

48:09.840 --> 48:11.840
it's like a small

48:11.840 --> 48:13.840
gravel playground.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.840
In your shoes.

48:15.840 --> 48:17.840
In your shoes.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.840
Don't you have anything else to say?

48:19.840 --> 48:21.840
I'm sorry. Move?

48:21.840 --> 48:23.840
What's your walking?

48:23.840 --> 48:25.840
Do you do a lot of foot scoops

48:25.840 --> 48:27.840
or walking gait?

48:27.840 --> 48:29.840
What's your gait?

48:29.840 --> 48:31.840
Can you come down for a second?

48:31.840 --> 48:33.840
This is creepy in a way.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.840
Come on down and walk in front of us.

48:35.840 --> 48:37.840
Yeah, come walk so we can...

48:37.840 --> 48:39.840
Yes, come down here.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.840
Oh, I've seen enough.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.840
You're scooping stair debris.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.840
So just start

48:45.840 --> 48:47.840
over here and kind of walk.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.840
I want to see if I can figure out the problem.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.840
We have to explain to everybody at home

48:51.840 --> 48:53.840
that she is wearing like three-foot

48:53.840 --> 48:55.840
tall shoes.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.840
Is the grit like throwing grappling hooks

48:57.840 --> 48:59.840
up your shoes?

48:59.840 --> 49:01.840
We must reach.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.840
They should be velcro-sealed.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.840
They're open? Okay, so let me see.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.840
I don't know.

49:07.840 --> 49:09.840
But I will say this, a confident gait.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.840
I do like a confident gait. Very hot.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.840
Thank you so much.

49:13.840 --> 49:15.840
Thank you.

49:21.840 --> 49:23.840
Between these two,

49:23.840 --> 49:25.840
this one or this one,

49:25.840 --> 49:27.840
what do you more into?

49:27.840 --> 49:29.840
I would say the first one.

49:29.840 --> 49:31.840
How about this one was sent by Ira Ray?

49:31.840 --> 49:33.840
Do you want to do it again?

49:33.840 --> 49:35.840
No.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.840
Are you Ira Ray?

49:37.840 --> 49:39.840
Who wants to know?

49:39.840 --> 49:41.840
Are we getting royalties from that dude?

49:41.840 --> 49:43.840
The person who wrote the original song

49:43.840 --> 49:45.840
who nobody can remember the name of.

49:45.840 --> 49:47.840
James Ray?

49:47.840 --> 49:49.840
What's his name?

49:49.840 --> 49:51.840
Jimmy Ray.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.840
Right there on the tip.

49:53.840 --> 49:55.840
In the song.

49:55.840 --> 49:57.840
This young dude next to me

49:57.840 --> 49:59.840
was asked by somebody whose fucking account

49:59.840 --> 50:01.840
was deleted. I'm so sorry everybody.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.840
They asked,

50:03.840 --> 50:05.840
trampoline sex?

50:05.840 --> 50:07.840
With like

50:07.840 --> 50:09.840
twelve question marks.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.840
These people are fast to know.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.840
Is it safe to have sex on a trampoline?

50:13.840 --> 50:15.840
I have a friend who's tried it.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.840
Can I just say real quick,

50:17.840 --> 50:19.840
this person just shook their head really like,

50:19.840 --> 50:21.840
no. No sir.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.840
Absolutely not.

50:23.840 --> 50:25.840
It's fine, but I wanted to make sure

50:25.840 --> 50:27.840
I really don't want the embarrassing increase.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.840
That's a good point,

50:29.840 --> 50:31.840
because if somebody gets up there and is like,

50:31.840 --> 50:33.840
ha, popcorn!

50:33.840 --> 50:35.840
That's probably a plus too hard.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.840
Your partner bounces up twelve feet.

50:37.840 --> 50:39.840
Can we all talk about like,

50:39.840 --> 50:41.840
clap if you've been on a trampoline

50:41.840 --> 50:43.840
in the past year.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.840
Awesome lives

50:45.840 --> 50:47.840
you guys are living.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.840
The fabric of trampolines

50:49.840 --> 50:51.840
is the worst.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.840
When you bounce and accidentally do a knee bounce

50:53.840 --> 50:55.840
and you come up and your knees don't, it's just bone.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.840
Can you imagine

50:57.840 --> 50:59.840
trying to like...

50:59.840 --> 51:01.840
Well people die on trampolines

51:01.840 --> 51:03.840
normally.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.840
That's without the introduction of bits.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.840
Yeah.

51:07.840 --> 51:09.840
I'm just talking about bit related

51:09.840 --> 51:11.840
injuries.

51:11.840 --> 51:13.840
There's so many springs.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.840
You get a bit

51:15.840 --> 51:17.840
caught in one of them.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.840
Kill me! Kill me!

51:19.840 --> 51:21.840
No, it's just the worst!

51:21.840 --> 51:23.840
If I got a bit in that spring...

51:23.840 --> 51:25.840
I want to be dead!

51:25.840 --> 51:27.840
I would start like a

51:27.840 --> 51:29.840
lobbyist group

51:29.840 --> 51:31.840
to get trampolines banned from life.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.840
I used to be a confident young man

51:33.840 --> 51:35.840
getting boners all the time.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.840
The plot of

51:37.840 --> 51:39.840
Superman 7 is that he gathers

51:39.840 --> 51:41.840
all the trampolines and he

51:41.840 --> 51:43.840
throws them into the sun.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.840
Sorry about your ruined bit.

51:47.840 --> 51:49.840
I feel like if you're having

51:49.840 --> 51:51.840
sex on a trampoline, there is a chance

51:51.840 --> 51:53.840
that you can get a rhythm going and be like,

51:53.840 --> 51:55.840
wow, this guy is great.

51:55.840 --> 51:57.840
There's a chance that you can balance

51:57.840 --> 51:59.840
inopportune moments and break it up.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.840
Dog Pound

52:01.840 --> 52:03.840
Dog Pound knows what I'm talking about.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.840
You're a

52:05.840 --> 52:07.840
f**k, Simon.

52:07.840 --> 52:09.840
They f**ked on a trampoline this morning.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.840
You know how a Dog Pound

52:11.840 --> 52:13.840
does?

52:13.840 --> 52:15.840
I need myself

52:15.840 --> 52:17.840
in the face on a trampoline once in a

52:17.840 --> 52:19.840
while.

52:19.840 --> 52:21.840
I can understand why you wouldn't want to introduce extra

52:21.840 --> 52:23.840
solo. This was solo

52:23.840 --> 52:25.840
mission.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.840
He was just maximally

52:27.840 --> 52:29.840
into it.

52:33.840 --> 52:35.840
We used to play a game

52:35.840 --> 52:37.840
where you stand in a circle

52:37.840 --> 52:39.840
on the outside of the trampoline.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.840
You put a tennis ball on it and it would bounce you

52:41.840 --> 52:43.840
and you have to dodge the tennis ball.

52:43.840 --> 52:45.840
Can you somehow have sex while doing that?

52:47.840 --> 52:49.840
I guess my question is,

52:49.840 --> 52:51.840
why do you do that?

52:53.840 --> 52:55.840
How are you guys doing?

52:55.840 --> 52:57.840
I forgot y'all

52:57.840 --> 52:59.840
were here.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.840
What else we got? We got anything else? It's time to wrap it up.

53:01.840 --> 53:03.840
We can do one more. Do you want to do one more?

53:03.840 --> 53:05.840
Audience questions.

53:05.840 --> 53:07.840
Who's got a super quick question?

53:07.840 --> 53:09.840
Anybody?

53:09.840 --> 53:11.840
Dog Pound!

53:11.840 --> 53:13.840
Dog Pound!

53:13.840 --> 53:15.840
First off, this person is going to tell us what horses feel like.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.840
What horses feel like? You said you touched one.

53:19.840 --> 53:21.840
So, so smooth.

53:21.840 --> 53:23.840
Grab a seat there.

53:23.840 --> 53:25.840
What's your name?

53:25.840 --> 53:27.840
I would say Ghost Life.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.840
Your name is Ghost Life.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.840
Pete.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.840
Pete.

53:33.840 --> 53:35.840
I was wondering if I could get a picture

53:35.840 --> 53:37.840
of all your Triforce tattoos.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.840
Travis is going to take his shirt off, but otherwise...

53:39.840 --> 53:41.840
Which I am totally open to.

53:43.840 --> 53:45.840
Can we do that after the show?

53:45.840 --> 53:47.840
Or can we do it during the show? Let's take a vote.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.840
No.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.840
After.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.840
After.

53:55.840 --> 53:57.840
I mean, I can just pull a boob out.

53:57.840 --> 53:59.840
You were voting for after.

53:59.840 --> 54:01.840
Okay.

54:01.840 --> 54:03.840
Pete, did you have a query to help you with that?

54:03.840 --> 54:05.840
Or was it just the tattoos?

54:05.840 --> 54:07.840
Other than that, your life is going great.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.840
That's the biggest problem.

54:09.840 --> 54:11.840
You're at 99.9% if only you could see my boob.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.840
And get a picture with it important.

54:15.840 --> 54:17.840
Could I flip it on?

54:17.840 --> 54:19.840
Are you going to flip it?

54:19.840 --> 54:21.840
Is it going to be Saturn after we're done with sex?

54:21.840 --> 54:23.840
No, I already got my trampolines.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.840
Perfect.

54:25.840 --> 54:27.840
I'm going to be skilled today.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.840
Maybe just towards Justin.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.840
If you have a question for me.

54:31.840 --> 54:33.840
I have three kids.

54:33.840 --> 54:35.840
I was just wondering if you had any advice.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.840
Pete, that's a good question.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.840
Is there anything that you would like to know?

54:39.840 --> 54:41.840
Give me the number one piece of pairing advice

54:41.840 --> 54:43.840
that I can then steal,

54:43.840 --> 54:45.840
re-appropriate,

54:45.840 --> 54:47.840
put on a t-shirt,

54:47.840 --> 54:49.840
and steal.

54:49.840 --> 54:51.840
He's looking.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.840
To be clear.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.840
One piece of pairing advice.

54:55.840 --> 54:57.840
Five words that are applicable.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.840
Now.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.840
Sex.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.840
I know we're talking about babies,

55:03.840 --> 55:05.840
but sexy maybe?

55:07.840 --> 55:09.840
Number one piece of pairing advice.

55:09.840 --> 55:11.840
Pete, give me.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.840
Put me on the spot.

55:13.840 --> 55:15.840
To be fair, Pete,

55:15.840 --> 55:17.840
you walk down and sat in the chair.

55:17.840 --> 55:19.840
You sat in the chair, Pete.

55:19.840 --> 55:21.840
Now you do your time.

55:21.840 --> 55:23.840
Pairing advice, Pete. Give it to me.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.840
Don't even think about it. You're overthinking.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.840
They're not my problem.

55:27.840 --> 55:29.840
I'm theirs.

55:29.840 --> 55:31.840
Yes!

55:31.840 --> 55:33.840
Yes!

55:33.840 --> 55:35.840
Pete out!

55:35.840 --> 55:37.840
I'll be honest. I was worried

55:37.840 --> 55:39.840
that anybody would be able to ride to the occasion.

55:39.840 --> 55:41.840
Pete,

55:41.840 --> 55:43.840
you rock and nail it. Dog power.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.840
Dog power.

55:45.840 --> 55:47.840
How are those beers?

55:47.840 --> 55:49.840
They're still good.

55:49.840 --> 55:51.840
And then he reveals himself.

55:51.840 --> 55:53.840
Pete was the hero of the show.

55:53.840 --> 55:55.840
Pete's the hero of the show.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.840
Pete saved it.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.840
Pete saved the show.

55:59.840 --> 56:01.840
Valuable.

56:01.840 --> 56:03.840
Okay.

56:03.840 --> 56:05.840
Folks, we are done.

56:05.840 --> 56:07.840
I want to get a final question from Griffin,

56:07.840 --> 56:09.840
but first I want to thank

56:09.840 --> 56:11.840
People's Improv Theater.

56:11.840 --> 56:13.840
Thank you guys so much.

56:13.840 --> 56:15.840
Thank you all.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.840
Thank you

56:17.840 --> 56:19.840
New York for coming to our show.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.840
On your way out,

56:21.840 --> 56:23.840
make sure to stop by. We got a bunch of new merch

56:23.840 --> 56:25.840
specifically for this show.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.840
So make sure you check it out.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.840
It's the fucking dopest.

56:29.840 --> 56:31.840
Awesome patches.

56:31.840 --> 56:33.840
These button packs.

56:33.840 --> 56:35.840
The patch says Fraternal Order of Brothers,

56:35.840 --> 56:37.840
which is actually really funny.

56:37.840 --> 56:39.840
Thank you. I was pretty proud of it.

56:39.840 --> 56:41.840
Amongst all these buttons,

56:41.840 --> 56:43.840
there's some real big winners.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.840
One is a picture of Griffin's face with

56:45.840 --> 56:47.840
I Ate All the Potato Chips on it.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.840
It's like the fucking best face.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.840
There's also an I Hate Sad Libs button.

56:51.840 --> 56:53.840
So make sure to pick that one.

56:53.840 --> 56:55.840
And an I Hate Sad Libs button.

56:55.840 --> 56:57.840
Travis almost busted my mouth with it.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.840
We were having trouble coming up with how to start the show.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.840
I was going to do a Freestyle Sadler's Ride

57:01.840 --> 57:03.840
where I just started a sentence.

57:03.840 --> 57:05.840
He lied.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.840
I hate you Ron.

57:07.840 --> 57:09.840
The buttons are awesome.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.840
We've got bumper stickers out there.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.840
My other ghost is a horse.

57:13.840 --> 57:15.840
My other horse is a ghost is one of those.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.840
But we've also got these awesome tote bags.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.840
And our posters are out there.

57:19.840 --> 57:21.840
If nothing else,

57:21.840 --> 57:23.840
stop by and grab one of these postcards.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.840
It's got a coupon code on the back

57:25.840 --> 57:27.840
that will give you 20% off if you buy the merch.

57:27.840 --> 57:29.840
And I think you can only get these here.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.840
Yeah, only here.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.840
Don't tweet that code.

57:33.840 --> 57:35.840
We will also be out there

57:35.840 --> 57:37.840
after the show to meet and greet

57:37.840 --> 57:39.840
and sign things.

57:39.840 --> 57:41.840
For like 45 seconds.

57:41.840 --> 57:43.840
All I want to ask

57:43.840 --> 57:45.840
is just

57:45.840 --> 57:47.840
keep it coming people.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.840
I want to see all of you.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.840
That's all I want to say.

57:51.840 --> 57:53.840
I want to thank John Lauder.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.840
I almost made it.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.840
I got to get the last word.

57:57.840 --> 57:59.840
Why am I just fondling

57:59.840 --> 58:01.840
this banana?

58:01.840 --> 58:03.840
Why am I fondling this banana

58:03.840 --> 58:05.840
for like 5 minutes?

58:05.840 --> 58:07.840
I want to say thank you to Sawbones.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.840
Sawbones!

58:09.840 --> 58:11.840
They're singing my show

58:11.840 --> 58:13.840
ever.

58:13.840 --> 58:15.840
I think those kids are going somewhere.

58:15.840 --> 58:17.840
Thank you for giving

58:17.840 --> 58:19.840
us a home.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.840
Thank you to the theater.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.840
Thank you to you all.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.840
That's everybody.
