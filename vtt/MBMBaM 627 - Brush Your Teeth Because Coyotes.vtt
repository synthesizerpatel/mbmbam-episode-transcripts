WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.300 --> 01:14.960
Hey welcome my brother my brother me and advice show for the modular. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your

01:14.960 --> 01:19.880
Expert I spitting okay. I'm your spittle this brother Travis McElroy

01:19.880 --> 01:22.920
I'm your sweet baby brother celebrity body language

01:23.240 --> 01:25.240
interpreter and and sort of

01:25.440 --> 01:31.920
Envoy to the stars and all that sweet drama drama that exists in the nebulous sort of space between them

01:32.560 --> 01:39.800
Griffin McElroy and boys we got a dozer to break down for you for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, isn't it?

01:39.800 --> 01:45.080
Strange, it's 90s kids are gonna love this one. Oh my god. They're wild for it

01:45.600 --> 01:48.360
Remember because the magic loogie episode of Seinfeld

01:49.360 --> 01:56.800
Recreated the Zap Rooter film as a spitting incident and now that is happening in real life funny show funny life

01:57.800 --> 02:03.740
It's just like when I had my vasectomy and the doctor dropped a junior mint into my testicles

02:03.920 --> 02:08.640
Yeah, I felt yeah, yeah, and it felt pretty good

02:08.640 --> 02:11.280
We yeah, it feels good. Yeah, man, it's

02:12.400 --> 02:15.560
Yeah, that's why we call this show my brother my waddle are in me

02:15.560 --> 02:22.120
And so you've heard all the takes that you need to at this point about these two

02:22.320 --> 02:27.420
Famouses and if one spit it on the other one, but we're here I think to put our own sort of like

02:28.120 --> 02:30.120
up twisted

02:30.520 --> 02:33.640
Skewed spin on it. You're right

02:34.560 --> 02:37.280
Because we I think the three of us

02:37.280 --> 02:39.280
have

02:39.360 --> 02:46.680
Operated in these circles. I've never met Christopher or Harold, but I do I met Chris

02:46.680 --> 02:52.080
I haven't met Christopher or Harold, but I have probably met people who have met Christopher and Harold

02:52.080 --> 02:56.680
So I feel uniquely qualified. I feel rule on this one

02:57.600 --> 03:01.480
First of all can't wait to see first of all get it out of the gotta get it

03:01.480 --> 03:05.760
Gotta get day one. Gotta get my tickets to this flick. I don't know what the yeah

03:05.760 --> 03:09.320
It is seems like so that's gonna be moving easy. It's gonna be

03:10.080 --> 03:12.080
Absolute slam dunk

03:12.080 --> 03:17.680
Everyone seems happy with it first step in the process is find out the name of the flick and then I'm gonna get on night

03:17.680 --> 03:23.840
It's spit night at the Hawksbury spit night at the Hawksbury gonna get on fun dango and secure my tickets

03:26.960 --> 03:31.960
Roku and so that's gonna give us a lot of the clues that we need but we don't need them

03:31.960 --> 03:33.960
I

03:34.080 --> 03:37.560
Lesser podcast I guess need to see the film

03:38.720 --> 03:41.460
And then and then they'll be able to rule on it

03:41.880 --> 03:46.960
I'm a star. I'm a body language expert to the stars. Go ahead Travis the one thing I know about the movie

03:47.200 --> 03:49.880
Yeah, is that if you look at the cast?

03:50.360 --> 03:54.160
Yeah, just like the first the four people overwhelmed by beauty

03:54.160 --> 03:54.760
You're well

03:54.760 --> 04:00.760
But also it seems like it seems like maybe four different movies are being made at the same time when I tell you that it's Florence

04:00.760 --> 04:07.400
Fewer who's yeah, right great great and then Chris pine. Oh, I could see them being bad by the time you're listening to this

04:07.400 --> 04:11.200
Yeah, it's Thursday when we're recording Thursday

04:11.200 --> 04:16.920
Oh, there's a lot of ball game between now and release day. Okay, but here's what I'm saying

04:16.920 --> 04:18.920
I could see Florence peer and

04:19.960 --> 04:21.960
and where

04:22.440 --> 04:26.880
And Chris pine being in the same movie. Okay, then we add in Harold Styles. Oh

04:26.880 --> 04:32.280
All right. Okay, that's entering and then Nick Kroll is there and I'm like, what is it? What is this movie about?

04:32.280 --> 04:38.640
What is this thing happening funny funny funny folks in it? Okay, so let's get into it. We don't see the loot the

04:39.120 --> 04:42.360
That spit no, it's that we don't see the spit land

04:42.640 --> 04:49.200
But if we did sort of try to chart the trajectory of it looks like it hit Chris pine on his wiener area

04:49.920 --> 04:51.560
Yeah

04:51.560 --> 04:56.940
Listen and then Chris pine looks down at his wiener area and he goes wow. He's like wow

04:57.760 --> 05:02.640
Wow, I'm gonna put the tiger on the table and yell at it right away Tuesday, please cuz Chris pines

05:03.120 --> 05:05.440
Rep came out was like this is ridiculous

05:06.080 --> 05:13.040
Frankly, and I this is an overused phrase but protests too much. He's like what it's ridiculous that you would even think this

05:13.040 --> 05:18.680
Why would you think that these two men would have any kind of beef? Why would there speak? That's ridiculous

05:18.680 --> 05:19.800
And it's just like just say no

05:19.800 --> 05:24.400
Why did you use so many words and then Harold came out and he was like, yeah

05:24.400 --> 05:28.600
I flew to Venice to spit on Chris pine, but I gave it a tone of voice

05:29.360 --> 05:35.480
That I may be projecting my own sort of insecurities onto it because he may have very well said

05:35.800 --> 05:40.840
Yeah, I I flew to Venice to spit on my like if I knew that I would have that opportunity

05:41.800 --> 05:48.200
To spit on Star Trek's Chris pine. I would fly to Venice for that on the gray man's Chris pine. Hell yeah

05:48.200 --> 05:50.200
I'd spit on him

05:50.400 --> 05:54.400
I'm saying if it was consensual because everyone saw that was like, whoa, there must be beef

05:54.400 --> 05:59.440
But we don't know the relationship between these two people and that brings me to my main point

06:00.280 --> 06:06.000
Harold stylish has been famous for since he was a baby and

06:06.780 --> 06:12.040
He was the Gerber baby. He was Gerber's baby. He was the Coppertone baby with the buzz

06:12.040 --> 06:17.760
Out he was all the babies in that one insurance commercial that like talked about insurance. You guys remember that?

06:20.040 --> 06:26.200
Kids bop he was success good. He was all these famous children and then he was in one direction

06:27.120 --> 06:28.360
with Zane

06:28.360 --> 06:32.840
Which multiple directions by the way, so like that time to rename that man

06:32.840 --> 06:36.920
And that's one of Travis's funny jokes that he's Travis has a bunch of them about one direction

06:36.920 --> 06:43.120
But anyway, all of this is to say we're building to something. We're building to my point which is

06:43.880 --> 06:45.880
Until this point in his life

06:46.280 --> 06:49.240
Harold stylish has been told that it's good

06:49.680 --> 06:55.340
To for him to spit on people that people like it when he spits on them. Yeah, because of his like

06:56.680 --> 07:00.600
Tremendous fame like there's so many if you know who he is

07:01.200 --> 07:04.800
He's never been chastised. Yeah, one of his actions

07:04.800 --> 07:11.120
I'm actually really excited that it seems like he found a boundary because now everyone's just like we love it Harry

07:11.400 --> 07:13.400
Harold stylish, whatever you do

07:14.400 --> 07:16.440
That look that's great that song that's great

07:16.440 --> 07:20.800
Everything you do is great this pine came up to him after as he's like, there'll be a consequence for that

07:20.800 --> 07:23.140
And he was like, oh, what do you mean?

07:23.840 --> 07:25.840
Well, I don't know

07:30.680 --> 07:33.800
When Chris pine looks down at his at his dirty lap

07:33.800 --> 07:37.160
He is not it's not disbelief. It's

07:38.040 --> 07:39.440
thoughtful

07:39.440 --> 07:46.200
Consideration of like is this good? This man is good. Is this good? He's very famous and very handsome

07:46.200 --> 07:50.640
Is this a good thing you did to me? I don't know. He spat upon my chinos. Do I?

07:51.240 --> 07:55.720
Do I hate this? Do I love it? Do I love this? I think what you're seeing in

07:56.560 --> 07:58.560
Chris pines face. Yeah

07:59.560 --> 08:02.960
There's a if you follow the logic you can watch it

08:02.960 --> 08:06.120
You can see his face. Here's what he's thinking. Uh-huh. Well

08:07.040 --> 08:08.540
Huh?

08:08.540 --> 08:15.600
Someone has Harry Styles just spit on my dick. Yeah, I know I'm already Captain Kirk. Yeah, and that was good

08:15.600 --> 08:20.560
I liked I don't know. I don't know how many more of those if any I'm gonna do

08:20.600 --> 08:24.920
Yeah, should I know Harry Styles off his balcony? I haven't done

08:24.920 --> 08:28.560
Let just let me finish cuz I gotta walk you through Chris pines mental state

08:29.360 --> 08:30.960
this I

08:30.960 --> 08:36.160
Don't love this for obvious reasons. I'm right now. I'm wet now and stick

08:36.160 --> 08:38.720
I'm wet now, and I don't like it. Okay, and everyone knows

08:39.360 --> 08:42.740
There is a certain chain of events here

08:43.560 --> 08:47.400
wherein when you look up Chris pine in the future

08:48.000 --> 08:49.040
encyclopedia

08:49.040 --> 08:53.340
It is actor on whom's dick Harry Styles spit

08:53.340 --> 08:58.640
Yeah, I have not established so many other pillars of my identity that it wouldn't be

08:58.640 --> 09:05.200
Fairly high up. Yeah, if this continues to be the thing that everybody talks about forever, right?

09:05.200 --> 09:09.820
It's like I don't want this to be a thing where like people see me in there like lol

09:10.680 --> 09:14.360
Anchorman 3 let's get Chris fine in there. So somebody can spit

09:14.840 --> 09:20.760
That is a good point Justin. I don't want Chris pine doesn't want his dick referenced in comedy for a while

09:20.760 --> 09:25.640
He wants it referenced in drama, right? He's like, I'm fine if people make Thomas about my dick

09:25.640 --> 09:32.120
That's fine, right and then cuz it's just sort of like Chris Rock right now every script he gets. Yeah, like three pages

09:32.120 --> 09:38.120
It's like and then someone hits you full force in the face. Yeah, because America has been talking about that

09:38.120 --> 09:45.400
And I am surprised the reference that the reps for those two gentlemen did not pull a similar gambit of like do you really think?

09:46.520 --> 09:51.000
William Willard Smith would hit Chris Rock at the Oscars. Come on

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
I don't know what you thought you saw. The Internet's just chewing its cud. Yeah, the Internet feeds itself

09:57.840 --> 10:00.680
It's an Ouroboros. You see they're just

10:01.440 --> 10:08.200
Like us they are just like us. They spit on each other's dicks just like us was

10:08.600 --> 10:13.280
Kidding around he was attempting to do face paint and is extremely bad at it

10:13.280 --> 10:21.040
There was a fly on Chris Rock's cheek and he was trying to help him out. There was a small fire on Chris Pine's balls. I

10:21.680 --> 10:26.120
Again and this British hero who served his country in Dunkirk

10:26.480 --> 10:30.760
He saved him at least now if you ask Will Smith his favorite singer

10:30.760 --> 10:36.040
You know that his answer is always gonna be all Harry Styles. Oh sure. He's basically my favorite dude

10:36.040 --> 10:38.400
Did you see what he spit on Chris Pines dick?

10:38.400 --> 10:43.440
I kind of just kind of left the left the public consciousness of their well

10:44.040 --> 10:45.720
Problems are our problems

10:45.720 --> 10:49.520
They're just like us and I love that about them and hey, you know

10:49.520 --> 10:56.640
Maybe maybe Chris Pine was hungry and Harry Styles could sense that and he's trying to mama bird into his mouth and he just missed

10:56.640 --> 11:00.680
There's so many different great possibilities for what could have happened, right?

11:00.680 --> 11:05.700
Yeah, but none of them none of them did that we know of we will know history will never know

11:05.700 --> 11:12.020
I will say this please say if Harry Styles did spit on Chris Pine

11:12.280 --> 11:16.700
He should be embarrassed of the bad loogie. He did it wasn't

11:17.180 --> 11:23.020
See it wasn't impressive if you're gonna, you know, if you're gonna go to town, you better go to Lincoln

11:23.780 --> 11:26.020
Hawkwood really get one out that room for air

11:26.780 --> 11:29.020
Maybe that was it. Maybe there was no loogie

11:29.020 --> 11:37.100
But maybe Harold stylish is perfected like making a loogie sound effect and he like made it and then Chris Pine was like

11:37.100 --> 11:42.540
I definitely have just gotten spit up. Oh, that's it. He was like what Wow, there's no spit

11:42.540 --> 11:47.940
But I was convinced the way you made the sound with your mouth. That's I thought I'd been spit upon

11:47.940 --> 11:54.540
Is this another one of your magic goofs? Yeah that you're known for. It's like when you step to someone you're like, oh

11:54.540 --> 12:00.960
You flinched it was like that. It was a fake. It was a fake spit and the you know, there's a there's a

12:02.220 --> 12:06.980
Cultural barrier there is and a quiet beauty. There's a quiet beauty. I control barrier

12:07.660 --> 12:14.060
You know what? We solved it. Let's move on. It's settled. It's settled. This is an advice show

12:15.100 --> 12:18.140

12:18.140 --> 12:25.600
Live the best fullest life that you can if you have questions you send them to mbnb am at maximumfund.org

12:26.080 --> 12:27.840
And we help you

12:27.840 --> 12:32.720
This is an advice show. We're ready to help you. We stand ready. We're by your side ready

12:32.720 --> 12:36.640
What was Florence Pugh doing during all this? We have not I don't know

12:37.080 --> 12:43.080
Why you are gripping so tightly we have moved on my son. I want to be part of the culture surprise

12:43.080 --> 12:49.360
My son is a year and a half old. Okay, guys. We've been lucky to have a lot of gifts sent to him from generous family

12:49.360 --> 12:53.680
And friends, however, there's one problem people keep sending in personalized piggy banks

12:53.880 --> 12:57.640
We're now at four piggy banks or we're running out of places to keep these things

12:57.720 --> 13:03.840
The second piggy bank was funny after the third piggy bank. I thought surely we won't get any more, but they still keep coming

13:03.840 --> 13:10.480
We can't sell them because they have our son's full name and birth date on them. Yeah brothers, please

13:10.480 --> 13:16.080
What do we do about all these banks? That's for piggy bank plethora. Let me say this. Oh

13:17.160 --> 13:21.120
Piggy banks these days are bullshit

13:21.560 --> 13:25.860
Okay, because they put it a little hole on the bottom of it

13:26.600 --> 13:34.800
And you can get the money the whole thing with piggy banks is you put all your you know, leftover coins from the ice cream

13:35.560 --> 13:39.880
Stand and yeah, I don't like an arcade token or something. You'll find that later

13:39.880 --> 13:42.280
Yeah, you'll get that out later. But and then

13:42.840 --> 13:47.800
When the need for money is so great. You must smash this beloved

13:48.720 --> 13:54.040
Object so that you can get the stuff out of it. So maybe this is a return

13:54.760 --> 14:00.040
To a better time where you you have to smash these banks

14:00.920 --> 14:02.760
Because times are tough out there

14:02.760 --> 14:07.240
We should smash more banks frankly than yes piggy banks, but this is good practice

14:07.240 --> 14:12.640
Yeah, it's good practice for smashing banks. Here's uh, I was struck by something Justin hearing you read it

14:12.640 --> 14:14.640
So well out loud by the way

14:17.360 --> 14:22.080
It was good delivery you did great but the second bank was funny

14:22.680 --> 14:27.080
Made me think is this a possibility? Like have you talked about is this a bit?

14:27.080 --> 14:33.560
Your family is doing with you included like did they like I'm not saying they got behind your back and talked about it

14:33.560 --> 14:38.880
I'm saying that like was there accidentally they got two banks, right and you talked about it with your family and we're like

14:38.880 --> 14:39.880
This is funny, huh?

14:39.880 --> 14:45.640
They thought oh because I got two and then there were some members of your family perhaps that were like we'll keep the bit

14:46.000 --> 14:49.720
Rolling. Oh, we'll do like a third and a fourth and you know

14:49.720 --> 14:56.600
We'll give them another one for their second birthday and they're gonna be like a piggy bank is the thing to get this kid

14:56.640 --> 15:02.360
Yeah, because that we've talked about it before once your family is like, oh, they love you know unicorns

15:02.360 --> 15:04.600
Let's get him a unicorn every time. Yeah, right

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You need to understand the rules of engagement

15:09.880 --> 15:13.180
Which happened the movie and also

15:15.160 --> 15:19.480
The real stuff because we have we have dabbled in this

15:19.840 --> 15:25.360
we're like one of you guys will get one of my beautiful bundles of joy like some

15:26.160 --> 15:28.680
extra sloppy GAC and then

15:28.680 --> 15:36.680
One of you I would never do just don't give my son's an extra sloppy guy and then you know in return it's like

15:36.680 --> 15:40.160
Oh, okay. Well, here's a very loud party robot for your children

15:40.560 --> 15:42.560
And it doesn't you can't turn it off

15:42.840 --> 15:49.440
So once once you have to step it up at least answering kind of maybe escalate it. I'm thinking get them

15:50.280 --> 15:56.400
Someone who has given you a piggy bank for your child get them a piggy bank with their adult name on it

15:56.400 --> 16:02.360
Oh my god, and a date in the future, but do not explain

16:03.240 --> 16:08.640
What that means what that date is like a threat though Griffin?

16:09.920 --> 16:17.640
Yeah, maybe a little bit, huh? Or maybe it's like you'll need this money on you know, July 28th

16:18.920 --> 16:20.920
2029 or maybe

16:20.920 --> 16:27.680
Something else maybe something else happens. I don't know. I do not know. I love having piggy banks around our house

16:27.920 --> 16:31.920
Yeah, okay. I always whenever I find loose change in there. I just leave them and

16:32.600 --> 16:35.120
And put them in the girls piggy banks now a place to put change

16:35.120 --> 16:39.800
It's fantastic and it's also great because sometimes you go to the car wash, you know, like, oh I need some quarters

16:40.760 --> 16:42.040
time to

16:42.040 --> 16:45.840
Get on it. We got a big old coke bottle bank for for BB

16:45.840 --> 16:49.580
I got it. I got a subscription in magic tunnel. So

16:50.400 --> 16:54.140
That's not a problem for me anymore. I roll right through you have a car wash

16:54.760 --> 17:00.800
Subscription subscription and it's magic. Hey, hey, mr. Green-eyed monster. Maybe calm down a little bit

17:00.800 --> 17:03.400
I do okay, and my wife's a physician

17:03.880 --> 17:10.720
So I who doesn't make money from that but like my I do okay, and so I got a subscription to the car wash

17:10.720 --> 17:13.200
Okay, yeah, I went with the mid-tier

17:13.200 --> 17:14.640
Oh, okay

17:14.640 --> 17:16.640
Why do you need to subscribe?

17:16.720 --> 17:20.200
Why do you need to subscribe? Why can't you just go and get your car washed when it's dirty?

17:20.200 --> 17:23.320
I don't know why you need to subscribe to it probably a better deal

17:23.320 --> 17:27.320
I have to assume you're gonna you're gonna you're basically yeah

17:27.320 --> 17:32.440
I see the magic tunnel as much as I do you're basically losing money if you don't have a subscription

17:33.000 --> 17:37.100
Now Justin when you say the phrase when you go through the magic tunnel as much as I do

17:37.100 --> 17:44.380
Do you know like how many and I I'm like my mind is boggled by how many different things that could be a euphemism for

17:44.540 --> 17:46.700
Yeah, yeah in this case. It's a

17:47.500 --> 17:54.220
Clean car a clean car. Why are you letting your car get so dirty? So I don't kids just love it

17:54.260 --> 17:58.140
They're just wild about all the car wash experience the car wash

17:58.140 --> 18:01.140
Oh, I thought you said kids love your car and they keep

18:01.140 --> 18:06.100
Running out to it and getting their disgusting fingers off. Kids love this car wash. They're you show up

18:06.100 --> 18:13.540
They're throwing dum-dums in your car some dog biscuits. They're they're hand washing. There's lights. There's sounds. Whoa, whoa, whoa projections

18:13.540 --> 18:19.120
Hold on. Let's not just gloss over this Justin. You don't have a dog. Also what you're describing can't

18:20.100 --> 18:27.140
Possibly exist a little bit of car wash slash dinner theater for children. Yeah, it's fantastic if they Travis

18:27.140 --> 18:29.860
I'm sorry, but like if I don't have a dog now

18:29.860 --> 18:31.180
but

18:31.180 --> 18:33.180
If I have a subscription

18:33.700 --> 18:40.620
To the car wash and every time I go through I could be getting a dog biscuit and I don't those costs add up

18:41.380 --> 18:46.820
This is why you're broke all the time because you don't think about dollars and cents, you know

18:46.820 --> 18:50.500
I mean, I got a huge garbage bag full of dog biscuits in my house

18:50.500 --> 18:55.540
What are you worried about coyotes because I throw that out there that's gonna keep them busy all day long

18:55.540 --> 19:01.780
Well, it'll also turn your house into a fucking coyote. Just hang the zone

19:01.940 --> 19:08.020
It's gonna get ugly in there. I put weed in the dog biscuits. Oh, not an okay thing to say but go ahead

19:08.380 --> 19:14.820
Odie's. Oh, that's fine. Yeah. No, they're bad. They're gross. Oh, yeah, they kill the deer around the house

19:14.820 --> 19:19.240
Oh a deer are terrible. They killed my willow tree. We don't need to talk. We don't have to go. Okay

19:19.240 --> 19:23.820
I you know what they all ate all my sweet blackberries. So I am saying

19:23.820 --> 19:24.900
and

19:24.900 --> 19:28.620
For that they deserve death. I agree. I agree

19:28.620 --> 19:34.100
They're fucking farmer John over there trying to stab Peter cottontail with your pitch Peter

19:34.220 --> 19:37.460
Cottontail should have stayed the fuck out of McGregor's garden Griffin

19:37.460 --> 19:40.980
Do you want me to kill the deer or kill the coyote cuz I gotta kill one of them

19:40.980 --> 19:44.300
So you choose okay, it's the ones on your hand

19:44.300 --> 19:50.340
It seems like the magic tunnel is where you go to to slake the thirst of your dark passenger

19:50.340 --> 19:56.620
so that the the wildlife in your neighborhood doesn't have to be killed for eating your berries or

19:57.420 --> 20:03.740
Fucked up on these crazy biscuits. There's a there is a coyote in the region right now. Just the one

20:04.580 --> 20:06.780
Maybe probably a pack right? They tend to do that

20:06.780 --> 20:11.220
Yeah, I mean they don't like show up and give you a brochure with how many are in the region

20:12.100 --> 20:17.360
Hey, man, we were acquired by law. We're moving into the neighborhood just like not I know I don't know

20:17.360 --> 20:23.200
But they so they kill the deer and they're like bad. They suck. They're terrible right these terrible coyotes

20:23.720 --> 20:29.060
And they'll attack children if they're if they're out there and my kids are know about this

20:29.240 --> 20:33.520
So they're they're kind of worried about it. And man, I gotta say I

20:34.520 --> 20:38.800
Don't have to fight with my kids about coming inside or listening to me really at all

20:38.800 --> 20:44.780
They don't listen to me when I say hey come inside. It's time to go get ready for bed, but they'll listen to coyotes

20:44.780 --> 20:50.980
Yeah, you should listen to your dad out there. Listen, your dad's working hard. You should listen to he's a good guy

20:50.980 --> 20:52.180
I love his podcast

20:52.180 --> 20:57.740
No, but they're like that don't respond to that if I say come in they say no if I say come in there's coyotes out

20:57.740 --> 20:59.820
There come in it's no problem

21:01.980 --> 21:05.260
Coyotes is what I'm saying that those are called dogs Justin

21:06.180 --> 21:08.180
But I can't threaten my kids

21:08.180 --> 21:14.180
Sure, you could I can't say I can't say brush your teeth or I'm gonna get a dog. Oh

21:17.100 --> 21:20.780
Brush your teeth or mr. Brutus is gonna pounce when you least expect it

21:21.580 --> 21:24.220
This is what do you think? I have all these dog biscuits kids

21:24.220 --> 21:27.620
You think I get these if I didn't have a nice can I ask a question? Yeah

21:28.140 --> 21:30.140
Why do you guys keep asking me about my car?

21:34.100 --> 21:35.620
Every week

21:35.620 --> 21:39.180
It's a normal thing. It scans your license plate. So you don't have to stop and

21:40.020 --> 21:45.980
You're so on the grid future tech. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I'm not Travis. I'm not just on the grid

21:45.980 --> 21:52.700
I am the kind of person that has a car wash subscription. I'm on a specific point that I am 100%

21:53.220 --> 21:57.700
Locatable. Yes on the apex of the grid. He's got his own axis

21:58.180 --> 22:02.060
Hey, can we go to the wizard? The Wizards got a good one for us today. I love that. Hey guys

22:02.060 --> 22:06.380
I'm having a great time. This has been so I was so glad man. I love doing this show with you guys

22:06.380 --> 22:08.540
So the wizard sent this one in via his

22:09.060 --> 22:12.820
His familiar who is a raven named Dylan sent this in. Thank you Dylan

22:12.820 --> 22:18.740
It's a wiki how in the title of the wiki how is how to moan how to moan?

22:18.740 --> 22:25.360
Oh boy moaning moaning tells your partner that you're turned on or feeling a quick

22:25.460 --> 22:31.500
Wait before you get into it before we start learning could Travis and I are maybe all three

22:31.500 --> 22:37.460
I don't want to do it. Could we all practice our like moan and see if it gets better by the end of the article?

22:37.460 --> 22:40.740
I think that's a good point. Yeah, we never do that. Can I put a codicil on this?

22:41.100 --> 22:45.300
It's a we eat at a big beef sandwich and it tastes good

22:45.300 --> 22:51.500
And this is the moan that comes after it because I do not want to expose our listeners to anything

22:52.300 --> 22:54.220
actually salacious

22:54.220 --> 22:59.940
Involving us. This is a beef sandwich satisfaction sandwich moan and this is appropriate for your ringtone

22:59.940 --> 23:06.380
This is our big sandwich moan our real big sandwich moan. How big's the sandwich? I regret this

23:06.860 --> 23:10.100
Okay, I'll do mine first. Justin you go first as the oldest. Okay. Oh

23:15.060 --> 23:22.900
That's good, that was actually pretty that actually felt really I feel like I've heard you make that noise post sandwich before or it's

23:22.900 --> 23:24.900
Usually when I sit down. Yeah

23:24.900 --> 23:30.580
Yeah, let me see cuz I'm gonna do a combination of like I just tasted it and it's good

23:30.580 --> 23:34.620
Yeah, go ahead. Don't put a hat on a hat man. Okay moan like you ate a big sandwich

23:37.180 --> 23:41.060
That's not that sucked actually I hated for whatever reason I liked

23:43.860 --> 23:47.300
An open mouth I can try to weird. Oh, let me try. Oh worse

23:47.300 --> 23:54.020
Oh, what's wrong with me? Here we go. Oh, I'm gonna eat the big sandwich if you figured it out, please

23:56.780 --> 23:58.780
Yeah

23:58.780 --> 24:04.860
Now Griffin was that your real big you did a bit there's no it's impossible to judge your growth

24:07.380 --> 24:11.700
But I like to I these are the barrier I actually Travis if you make that noise one more time

24:11.700 --> 24:17.780
Oh, I'm not joking. I'll hang up the call that how am I supposed to get better if I don't practice listen

24:17.780 --> 24:23.840
We each get one more when you're done with the article fair. You two will finish the show without me. Please don't okay

24:24.180 --> 24:28.380
He will definitely definitely I'm gonna try not to but I get to be one after the fact

24:28.380 --> 24:31.220
I have a bear a moan is sexy involuntary noise

24:31.220 --> 24:35.340
You moan in the heat of the moment because you're overcome by sensation from the big beefy sandwich

24:35.340 --> 24:41.260
Uh-huh. Not everyone moans naturally, but training yourself to moan can be a great way to show someone that you're enjoying yourself

24:42.300 --> 24:45.780
Training yourself to moan can be a great way to show someone you're okay

24:46.380 --> 24:52.420
understanding the moan know that moaning is involuntary in theory a moan is a noise of passion that escapes you when you're overcome by

24:52.500 --> 24:55.000
pleasure or sensation I'm actually

24:55.660 --> 24:57.460
my

24:57.460 --> 25:03.360
Nerves are so like high-strung right now that I need you all to not even make like

25:03.360 --> 25:04.880
agreement

25:04.880 --> 25:08.720
But Griffin, can I ask you a question? Yeah, why do you feel like?

25:09.440 --> 25:11.800
Why do you feel like the anxiety so hot?

25:12.400 --> 25:14.200
Why are you so off put by it?

25:14.200 --> 25:19.240
I thought that this this is one of I'm gonna put something else going on in your life that I don't know about

25:19.240 --> 25:22.120
I've just gotten you feeling so stressed. That's what I'm asking

25:22.120 --> 25:25.840
I'm putting this bit in a box that I have labeled things

25:25.840 --> 25:33.360
I thought would be funny but turned out to be instantly so gross that I didn't want to be associated with it any longer

25:34.120 --> 25:40.920
You're good. Hey, I thought you're getting on me about my car wash subscription. I'll get on you about label maker prices

25:40.920 --> 25:48.200
I mean you're burning through this tape with these huge labels listen to other people moan watch watch YouTube videos about how to moan

25:48.200 --> 25:56.200
Yeah, that's where they are

25:58.600 --> 25:59.880
Guess that hey

25:59.880 --> 26:06.520
Hey wiki how at least provide some search terms if that's your claim because most of the time you do that

26:06.520 --> 26:08.520
No, no, no, no, no

26:09.360 --> 26:12.820
Okay, don't feel pressured to moan everyone responds to intense pleasure in their way

26:12.820 --> 26:15.280
And you don't need to force yourself to moan if it doesn't come naturally to you

26:15.280 --> 26:23.080
Yes, some people are naturally very loud in bed, but the moons you hear in movies or pornography are intentionally stylized versions of real out reality

26:24.560 --> 26:31.720
So that's an important one don't don't just make the sound too because you think you're supposed to make it it should be an exaltation of

26:33.720 --> 26:35.280
Joy

26:35.280 --> 26:40.080
Pleasure well now hold on wiki how article how are you gonna teach me how to make the sound?

26:40.080 --> 26:46.040
But assume I just know the right time to do it give me some pointers on timing as well

26:46.040 --> 26:51.220
Oh, you don't want to do it right at the beginning. Yeah, that's a definitely know that you just like zip

26:55.560 --> 27:00.760
Avoid outright faking it of course I do I will say that I do tend to moan when I take my bill off for the

27:00.760 --> 27:09.000
Shoes shoes is a good one my tiny socks my rendered waist flesh can finally begin to heal

27:11.440 --> 27:13.440
Moan softly during

27:13.840 --> 27:18.400
Foreplay moan loudly when things get intense now. That's interesting

27:18.760 --> 27:23.200
That's a foot now. We're talking about like we're putting together like a DJ

27:23.640 --> 27:27.600
like playlist like you want to get the party going with

27:27.600 --> 27:30.120
huh, and then get into the like

27:31.240 --> 27:33.440
That kind of how loudly once again

27:33.440 --> 27:38.380
I'm gonna need some decibels here cuz there is definitely a level you could hit where they would be like whoa

27:38.540 --> 27:44.180
Okay, so let's this is where the rubber hits the road practicing your moan start by sighing start by sighing softly

27:44.180 --> 27:55.060
That's that was great guys that was great, and it didn't make me feel uncomfortable breathe this is great breathe in and out audibly

27:55.060 --> 28:16.820
Suck so fucking bad. That's in it, but that's good. Now. We have like now. We know what parameters. It's somewhere in there. Sigh? Sigh? Fine. Whatever noise I was making. Bad. We hate it.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.700
As your breathing intensifies as add some voice and tone to your breath

28:20.700 --> 28:25.780
HAHAHAHAHA, no wait, I'm doing Gorilla.

28:25.800 --> 28:29.620
I think that's the Sect Shape. It just hit me. I was doing Gorilla

28:31.300 --> 28:37.720
Yeah, I was doing like sort of like Appalachian sort of scream scat which was which is also pretty fun

28:38.420 --> 28:40.420
Add in a few pieces

28:40.420 --> 28:42.420
Oh

28:53.300 --> 28:55.300
Jonathan calm down

29:00.660 --> 29:02.340
I don't know who that is

29:02.340 --> 29:07.460
Whenever we do that sound but it does it just turned into animal from the muppets a little bit

29:07.460 --> 29:10.500
Do you actually not know lead singer corn from the song?

29:12.900 --> 29:16.820
Freak on a leash. I thought was falling away from me. Anyway, try it out next time you're with a partner

29:16.980 --> 29:22.820
Please don't do this. Please we're having fun. Don't do this. Remember that there is no right or wrong way to moan

29:22.900 --> 29:24.900
We have proven that to be

29:25.600 --> 29:27.620
Categorically untrue. There's

29:27.620 --> 29:29.620
there may only be like

29:29.620 --> 29:36.900
four correct ways to moan and then an infinite spectrum of bad and wrong ways to moan

29:36.900 --> 29:41.380
Like we can also narrow down just uh, like vowel sounds that are because like oh

29:42.340 --> 29:45.140
It's not a good one. I was bad in the moment

29:46.500 --> 29:48.500
Bad

29:48.500 --> 30:06.740
Is classic now a lot of people don't do consonants which is interesting if you're if you're wrapped with pleasure you just be like

30:12.340 --> 30:14.340
That's cool sandwich

30:14.420 --> 30:16.420
I love that

30:16.420 --> 30:19.940
Have you guys watched my mode have you guys been watching the bear? It's great

30:20.180 --> 30:22.660
It's about a guy and he's really stressed out about these beef sandwiches

30:22.660 --> 30:27.220
He makes but then he feeds them up and then he serves it to people and every episode has a special guest star

30:27.780 --> 30:29.780
On it and they're very famous people

30:29.940 --> 30:33.780
And then and then they'll be on that like patrick stewart will be on there and he'll be like, yeah

30:37.140 --> 30:39.140
Like what is wrong with you

30:40.100 --> 30:44.740
Um, that's it for the article I don't know no no, no, no, we're just getting started

30:44.740 --> 30:48.500
I mean, I can see if there's I can see if there's additional questions. There is none

30:49.300 --> 30:50.500
Any comments?

30:50.500 --> 30:54.660
Uh, no, it's got a 64 percent on uh review

30:55.300 --> 30:59.060
We don't really cover that number very often. Where's that? Where's that get you that percentage?

30:59.780 --> 31:04.820
Well, the way the percentages work is it's out of a hundred. I mean, I guess yeah, that's true, right?

31:05.140 --> 31:10.500
It's easy to compare. Okay trav. Are you ready for trab to do his bone griffin or should I go first or um?

31:10.500 --> 31:15.140
Um, I but can it be but here's my only request make it funny

31:15.860 --> 31:17.860
Okay, okay

31:17.860 --> 31:22.500
Well, we've learned a lot here. Let me think. Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna combo some things. Yeah, that's okay

31:22.660 --> 31:24.660
I think that's probably the best idea. Okay

31:24.980 --> 31:26.980
My my my my my my oh

31:27.300 --> 31:29.300
Yeah

31:32.100 --> 31:34.740
That's that one I don't like

31:34.740 --> 31:36.740
Bababababababababababa

31:40.020 --> 31:42.020
Oh sound effects, he didn't even

31:42.740 --> 31:48.900
Oh that's fun. I like the creaky door. Can you do the creaky door? And maybe you can even work a song in there

31:49.780 --> 31:51.780
Yeah

31:59.460 --> 32:01.860
And that's all you need to do hit that note, that was really

32:01.860 --> 32:03.400
I know in your head you were worried

32:03.400 --> 32:04.640
that you weren't gonna get there.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.560
Oh, I knew I could figure it out.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.400
Okay, thank you, Griffin, for sharing that.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.800
We are going to take a very brief commercial break,

32:12.800 --> 32:15.160
by which I mean we're just gonna talk about brands

32:15.160 --> 32:16.000
for a little bit,

32:16.000 --> 32:17.680
and then we'll talk about things other than brands,

32:17.680 --> 32:21.680
but probably we will talk about brands as well,

32:21.680 --> 32:23.440
unpaid, because that's our thing.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.480
Let's go to the Money Zone.

32:26.480 --> 32:39.480
The other day, I posted this picture of Justin and I

32:39.480 --> 32:42.080
at the Georgia Aquarium.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.640
It's a great picture, posted on Instagram,

32:43.640 --> 32:46.880
and someone said that my fit looked good.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.400
That's all Stitch Fix, baby.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.000
Yeah, fit is good.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.140
Fit is good.

32:51.140 --> 32:52.280
It was Stitch Fix pants.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.480
It was Stitch Fix shirt.

32:54.660 --> 32:56.380
I think it was my own shoes.

32:56.380 --> 32:59.280
The other ones, I think I'm just renting from Stitch Fix,

32:59.280 --> 33:00.780
but it was my own shoes.

33:00.780 --> 33:02.480
But I want to say thank you to Stitch Fix

33:02.480 --> 33:05.480
for getting all of my shit together.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.300
Yeah. Someone had to do it.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.320
Someone had to do it, and I appreciate it.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.760
You guys are also Stitch Fix boys, right?

33:11.760 --> 33:13.200
Oh, yes. Yeah.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.000
We should have come up with like names for,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.160
like if you're a Fixie, or you're just like a-

33:18.160 --> 33:20.320
A Fixer. A Fixer sounds cool, doesn't it?

33:20.320 --> 33:22.320
Oh, a Fixer, yeah.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.740
Stitch, Stitch guy?

33:24.740 --> 33:26.680
A Stitch, a Stitch Bitch?

33:26.680 --> 33:28.040
I was about to say this is Stitch Fix,

33:28.040 --> 33:30.380
then I saw that it's got a little Donald Duck

33:30.380 --> 33:32.160
poking out here. Oh, that's probably not.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.000
This is from the parks.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.400
I got this second hand off eBay,

33:34.400 --> 33:36.840
but it's the one garment I own

33:36.840 --> 33:38.800
that I didn't get from Stitch Fix, everything else.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.160
So, how does Stitch Fix work?

33:40.160 --> 33:41.900
It's simple. Simple.

33:41.900 --> 33:43.320
First, take a few minutes to set up

33:43.320 --> 33:45.520
your Stitch Fix style profile.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.740
Answer a few questions about what you like to wear,

33:47.740 --> 33:51.180
what you don't, and how open you are to trying new styles.

33:51.180 --> 33:54.080
Then, Stitch Fix expert stylist will go to work,

33:54.080 --> 33:56.240
finding items exclusively for you.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.200
Every piece is handpicked for you,

33:58.200 --> 34:01.560
and is unique to your size, style, and in your budget,

34:01.560 --> 34:03.880
which is nice. That's nice, I like that.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.800
Stitch Fix will send you five pieces to try on at home.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.000
Keep what you love, and send back what you don't.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.680
Shipping returns and exchanges are always free.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.120
And let's be clear here.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.020
Yeah, sometimes it's like pants and shirts,

34:15.020 --> 34:17.160
but also sometimes, right?

34:17.160 --> 34:18.900
Teresa's gotten jewelry in there.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.080
I got shoes. Whoa.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.960
I get all kinds of stuff, right?

34:21.960 --> 34:23.200
A new car?

34:23.200 --> 34:24.320
What?

34:24.320 --> 34:25.200
A new car?

34:25.200 --> 34:26.900
I've never gotten a new car in there yet,

34:26.900 --> 34:29.800
but Stitch Fix, if you're listening, I wouldn't say no.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.240
I mean, if the price is right, and if it fits me.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.000
If you think these ads are good now.

34:33.000 --> 34:33.840
Yeah, oh, give me a car.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.360
Can you slide a new car in there for me?

34:35.360 --> 34:37.560
Oh, yeah. I love that.

Let's find out together on our show,

35:02.840 --> 35:03.840
Let's Learn Everything,

35:03.840 --> 35:06.680
where we learn anything and everything interesting.

35:06.680 --> 35:07.720
My name's Caroline,

35:07.720 --> 35:10.640
and I studied biodiversity and conservation.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.460
My name's Tom,

35:11.460 --> 35:14.360
and I studied computer science and cognitive blah-blah-blah.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.200
Did you?

35:15.200 --> 35:19.000
And my name's Ella, and I studied stem cells

35:19.000 --> 35:20.400
and regenerative medicine.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.000
On our show, we do as much research

35:22.000 --> 35:22.980
as you would for a class,

35:22.980 --> 35:25.240
but we don't get in trouble for making each other laugh.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.080
And we get to say,

35:26.080 --> 35:26.920
fuck.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.400
Maybe not in the trailer.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.800
Subscribe to Let's Learn Everything

Are you ready to binge watch something old?

35:40.480 --> 35:43.880
The Greatest Generation is a podcast about Star Trek

35:43.880 --> 35:46.440
by a couple of hosts a little bit embarrassed

35:46.440 --> 35:48.960
to even have a Star Trek podcast.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.080
Hosted by me, Ben Harrison.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.160
And me, Adam Pranica.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.460
We get into the critical, the technical,

35:55.460 --> 35:58.800
the science fictional aspects of the show we love

35:58.800 --> 36:01.380
while roasting it and each other at the same time.

36:01.380 --> 36:03.120
We've completed an entire series

36:03.120 --> 36:05.400
about Star Trek The Next Generation,

36:05.400 --> 36:07.920
and another one about Star Trek Deep Space Nine,

36:07.920 --> 36:10.160
and we've just begun Star Trek Voyager.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.580
So now is a great time to start watching

36:12.580 --> 36:14.920
a new Star Trek series with us.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.960
So subscribe to The Greatest Generation on MaximumFun.org

Justin, do one of your classic bits.

36:30.140 --> 36:30.980
Yeah.

36:32.040 --> 36:32.880
You sure?

36:32.880 --> 36:34.140
Yeah, make it funny.

36:34.140 --> 36:36.140
Oh, yeah, okay.

36:37.480 --> 36:38.600
Can I just read up?

36:39.600 --> 36:40.440
Okay.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.600
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, yeah.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.020
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

36:44.020 --> 36:44.860
Yeah.

36:44.860 --> 36:46.680
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

36:46.680 --> 36:47.700
I wanna munch.

36:47.700 --> 36:48.540
Squad.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.520
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.520
I want to munch.

36:52.520 --> 36:53.360
Squad.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.200
Squad.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.920
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

36:55.920 --> 36:56.760
Welcome to Munch Squad.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.360
It's a podcast that's a podcast profiling

36:58.360 --> 37:02.100
the latest and greatest of brand eating.

37:02.100 --> 37:02.940
Just real quick,

37:02.940 --> 37:03.780
because I'm trying to highlight

37:03.780 --> 37:05.820
what great job you guys are doing, Griffin.

37:05.820 --> 37:09.820
When you said squad, you sounded exactly like Toad

37:09.820 --> 37:11.560
for the Mario games and I loved it.

37:11.560 --> 37:12.720
Oh, did I really?

37:12.720 --> 37:13.560
Yeah, at least to me.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.320
Does he yell squad a lot?

37:15.320 --> 37:16.280
No, I don't think he said squad,

37:16.280 --> 37:17.640
but just like the way he would do it,

37:17.640 --> 37:18.480
it made me really happy.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.640
There is a low helicopter over my house right now.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.480
Oh, they found you.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.240
I think it might be Joe.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.400
Oh, he's landing?

37:25.400 --> 37:27.280
I think it might be Joseph Gordon-Biden.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.640
McDonald's introduces cheese Danish to bakery menu.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.200
I just wanted to mention this very briefly

37:32.200 --> 37:34.360
because the lead on it says,

37:34.360 --> 37:35.680
it's giving fans a tasty way

37:35.680 --> 37:38.120
to switch up their seasonal routines

37:38.120 --> 37:42.080
in a world of pumpkin, maple, and pecan.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.580
Burn them down.

37:43.580 --> 37:46.200
So I just love that McDonald's is like,

37:46.200 --> 37:48.360
are you going to go with the pack?

37:48.360 --> 37:50.120
Are you going to go to McDonald's?

37:51.840 --> 37:54.000
Are you going to be a free thinker?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.040
Are you going to go to McDonald's?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.080
Another quick brief.

37:56.080 --> 37:59.360
I just want to say, tell Wingstop to fuck off

37:59.360 --> 38:01.640
because they came out with a chicken sandwich.

38:01.640 --> 38:02.600
What?

38:02.600 --> 38:06.680
Just go, just go ahead and put it out, no problem.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.000
Your name is Wingstop.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.960
You're an infant tickling yourself with a razor.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.960
You don't know what you're doing.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.080
Wingstop entered the chickens.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.260
How many more?

38:16.260 --> 38:17.100
How many more?

38:17.100 --> 38:18.480
It's cost actual lives.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.240
I'll keep saying it until it sinks in.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.880
They're offering their sandwich

38:21.880 --> 38:24.840
in the brand's 12 bold and distinct flavors.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.040
Wingstop quickly revealed that customers

38:27.040 --> 38:30.760
have been constrained to a category of bland,

38:30.760 --> 38:31.900
where there are only options,

38:31.900 --> 38:33.920
or plain, or spicy breaded sandwich.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.360
The flavor craving is real.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.320
With Wingstop selling out its entire supply

38:38.320 --> 38:42.280
at 1600 US locations in a matter of days,

38:42.280 --> 38:46.020
beating out Super Bowl Sunday transaction levels.

38:46.020 --> 38:46.860
Wow.

38:46.860 --> 38:47.680
Here's some key stats.

38:47.680 --> 38:48.760
Are you guys ready for this?

38:48.760 --> 38:51.360
They sold over a million chicken sandwiches in six days.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.480
Is that a lot though?

38:52.480 --> 38:54.360
Cause I don't know.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.400
Yeah, I don't know either.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.000
There's a lot of facts like this.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.160
I mean, it seems like a lot to me.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.560
Like if someone said you have to eat

39:00.560 --> 39:02.600
a million chicken sandwiches in six days,

39:02.600 --> 39:04.820
I'd be like, that's too many, right?

39:04.820 --> 39:09.540
They sold out of, this one gets me.

39:09.540 --> 39:13.380
They sold out of a four week supply in just six days,

39:13.380 --> 39:16.100
with some restaurants wiped of supply

39:16.100 --> 39:17.460
in as little as two days.

39:17.460 --> 39:19.280
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.700
This is a new product.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.580
You sent them a six day supply.

39:24.580 --> 39:25.500
Yeah.

39:25.500 --> 39:26.340
Proven.

39:26.340 --> 39:27.180
What were you basing?

39:27.180 --> 39:28.020
It's not a four week supply.

39:28.020 --> 39:30.300
Yeah, what were you basing that number on?

39:30.300 --> 39:32.720
Yeah, it's a six day supply, that's it.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.580
We sent them some.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.400
Why do these places insist on bragging

39:36.400 --> 39:38.380
about their poor supply chain?

39:38.380 --> 39:39.340
Yeah, it's brutal.

39:39.340 --> 39:41.340
Also, how did you run out?

39:41.340 --> 39:43.260
It's chicken on a sandwich.

39:43.260 --> 39:46.220
Did you like, you killed all the chickens you had?

39:46.220 --> 39:47.380
Like what happened?

39:47.380 --> 39:48.940
You did a bad job.

39:48.940 --> 39:50.620
How did you run out?

39:50.620 --> 39:53.600
These eggs are not hatching fast enough.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.580
How long does it take you to get more chickens

39:56.580 --> 39:57.620
to the restaurant?

39:57.620 --> 39:59.900
If on day one, it wasn't like,

39:59.900 --> 40:04.700
oh, we used up a lot of them today, send more.

40:04.700 --> 40:05.540
Here's another one.

40:05.540 --> 40:09.300
Exceeded chicken sandwich sales expectations by 300%.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.680
That's a fucking cool way of saying

40:11.680 --> 40:13.080
you don't know what you're doing.

40:13.080 --> 40:13.920
Yeah.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.540
Like you don't believe in ourselves.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.580
You should probably get somebody who can guess,

40:17.580 --> 40:20.620
who can take a bite of a sandwich and be like,

40:20.620 --> 40:23.380
yeah, they'll buy like a thousand of these, no problem.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.300
Like you should probably hire that person to tell you

40:26.300 --> 40:28.380
the viral marketing campaign for this,

40:28.380 --> 40:29.700
and I'm sure you all heard about it,

40:29.700 --> 40:32.500
it was number three trending on Twitter.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.340
Yeah.

40:33.340 --> 40:36.540
With all 100K free sandwich codes and giveaway

40:36.540 --> 40:39.540
called Chicken Sandwich Split claimed in under a day.

40:39.540 --> 40:41.700
Now hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

40:41.700 --> 40:45.420
A million sandwiches sold, a hundred thousand of them

40:45.420 --> 40:48.940
were free, seems a little inflated to me, everybody.

40:48.940 --> 40:52.900
Seems like they're trying to boost the juice just a bit.

40:52.900 --> 40:53.940
Just a little bit.

40:53.940 --> 40:58.020
Also, once you knew all 100,000 coupons were claimed,

40:58.020 --> 41:00.340
why weren't you like, we should make more?

41:00.340 --> 41:02.140
We're probably gonna need more.

41:02.140 --> 41:04.460
We've written so many chicken checks.

41:04.460 --> 41:07.080
We have gotten, people are going to cash them.

41:07.080 --> 41:09.780
They are going to, they are literally

41:09.780 --> 41:13.420
going to come home to roost and we must be ready for them.

41:13.420 --> 41:15.260
We have put them all in one basket

41:15.260 --> 41:16.980
and I'm angry at ourselves for doing that.

41:16.980 --> 41:17.820
Why didn't someone warn us before?

41:17.820 --> 41:21.580
There's so many idioms about knowing

41:21.580 --> 41:25.580
how many chickens or birds you have on hand

41:25.580 --> 41:26.660
at any given time.

41:26.660 --> 41:29.740
There's a lot of them, more than any other object.

41:31.580 --> 41:34.540
Heads up, if you go to wingstop.com, which by the way,

41:34.540 --> 41:38.820
traffic doubled over its usual rate at wingstop.com.

41:38.820 --> 41:42.020
If you go, there's a big banner ad that just says,

41:42.020 --> 41:43.900
heads up, sandwich lovers,

41:43.900 --> 41:46.180
the new chicken sandwich is sold out.

41:46.180 --> 41:48.700
Sorry, we fucked up so bad, it says,

41:48.700 --> 41:53.220
but we really got cucked by all you sandwich-loving maniacs.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.220
And I'm sorry. It's a supply chain issue.

41:55.220 --> 41:58.580
We ran out of microchips to put into the sandwiches

41:58.580 --> 42:00.980
and we got to wait for more to come in from overseas.

42:00.980 --> 42:01.820
That's on us.

42:01.820 --> 42:05.380
The launch of our wingstop chicken sandwich

42:05.380 --> 42:09.060
in 12 flavors exceeded our expectations on all fronts,

42:09.060 --> 42:11.500
says disgraced CEO, Michael Skipper,

42:12.900 --> 42:15.940
who doesn't even know if his chicken sandwich is good or not.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.080
So he only does a million of them.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.340
People are wild about these things.

42:20.340 --> 42:23.260
Our craveable product and viral campaign

42:23.260 --> 42:26.440
drove unprecedented, extraordinary demand

42:26.440 --> 42:27.960
for both our core guests,

42:27.960 --> 42:30.620
as well as brought in a lot of new Wingstop fans

42:30.620 --> 42:31.500
to the brand.

42:31.500 --> 42:35.260
But don't worry, we just squandered all that potential

42:35.260 --> 42:37.540
by then not having any more to sell them.

42:37.540 --> 42:41.660
So any kind of goodwill and notoriety

42:41.660 --> 42:44.600
we are gaining by popularity was then crushed

42:44.600 --> 42:48.140
as someone came in on day seven of selling a new product

42:48.140 --> 42:49.700
and we said, oh, it's out.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.180
No, no. We don't have any more.

42:51.180 --> 42:53.420
We didn't think anybody liked chicken and bread.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.820
Thanks to strong, trusted relationships

42:55.820 --> 42:57.460
with supplier partners,

42:57.460 --> 43:00.020
we anticipate having chicken sandwich supply

43:00.020 --> 43:02.460
back in restaurants soon.

43:02.460 --> 43:04.740
So fans and new guests alike can get their hands

43:04.740 --> 43:07.560
on this new favorite chicken sandwich.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.820
So you can really capitalize on this moment

43:09.820 --> 43:11.340
two weeks later.

43:11.340 --> 43:14.420
Yeah, they can prey upon our weakness.

43:14.420 --> 43:17.620
Chicken sandwich seekers can be alerted of restocks

43:17.620 --> 43:19.460
by signing up for Wingstop.

43:19.460 --> 43:20.300
Oh my God.

43:20.300 --> 43:22.340
Get out. Get out of the town.

43:22.340 --> 43:23.180
Can you imagine?

43:23.180 --> 43:25.900
My wife asks me every time I get an email

43:25.900 --> 43:27.340
and it makes the little email sound.

43:27.340 --> 43:28.780
She's just like, just being curious,

43:28.780 --> 43:30.060
taking interest in my life.

43:30.060 --> 43:30.900
Who's that?

43:30.900 --> 43:32.860
And I would have to say like, oh, good.

43:32.860 --> 43:33.700
Oh, baby.

43:33.700 --> 43:35.940
Actually, I can't fucking talk to you right now.

43:35.940 --> 43:36.780
I have to get the door.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.980
You're already halfway out the door.

43:38.980 --> 43:40.960
Now, you don't have any shoes on.

43:40.960 --> 43:41.800
What are you doing?

43:41.800 --> 43:42.620
I don't care.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.180
You don't understand.

43:44.180 --> 43:46.220
Chicken sandwich seekers can be alerted to restocks

43:46.220 --> 43:48.700
by signing up for Wingstop's digital database

43:48.700 --> 43:53.020
where once back, it can be purchased at a compelling value

43:53.020 --> 43:56.140
of 5.49 for an a la carte sandwich with a dip

43:56.140 --> 43:59.300
or 7.99 for the combo with fries and a drink.

43:59.300 --> 44:02.940
Hey guys, charge more.

44:02.940 --> 44:04.620
You fucked up.

44:04.620 --> 44:06.340
Charge three times.

44:06.340 --> 44:09.460
You did a six days, four week supply.

44:09.460 --> 44:12.600
You're charging one fourth as much as you should be.

44:12.600 --> 44:15.620
Charge $30 for the sandwich.

44:15.620 --> 44:16.820
Yeah.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.120
Or make them a quarter smaller.

44:19.120 --> 44:19.960
Like, there's a quarter the size.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.380
Just make them smaller sandwiches.

44:21.380 --> 44:22.460
These are sliders now.

44:22.460 --> 44:23.540
Sliders, they're sliders.

44:23.540 --> 44:24.660
We're cutting them.

44:24.660 --> 44:26.220
I heard there was one restaurant

44:26.220 --> 44:27.940
where the demand was so bad

44:27.940 --> 44:30.940
that they started cutting the chicken sandwiches in half

44:30.940 --> 44:32.480
and they were charging people full price,

44:32.480 --> 44:34.260
but they cut the chicken sandwiches in half.

44:34.260 --> 44:35.380
They ran out of halves

44:35.380 --> 44:37.660
and they started cutting them into fourths.

44:37.660 --> 44:40.440
And then they realized, wait a minute.

44:40.440 --> 44:44.140
We've passed out many more sandwiches than we should have.

44:44.140 --> 44:45.560
And they went back to the back

44:45.560 --> 44:48.060
and there was more wedges of chicken sandwich.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.620
And they just kept cutting

44:49.620 --> 44:52.740
and there just kept being more chicken sandwich.

44:52.740 --> 44:54.900
Did you guys hear about that?

44:54.900 --> 44:56.500
That happened at Wingstop.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.620
God's not dead.

44:58.620 --> 45:03.620
He's at Wingstop.

45:03.780 --> 45:04.780
He's at Wingstop.

45:04.780 --> 45:06.660
And even he can't get this fucking sandwich.

45:06.660 --> 45:07.920
No, no, no, no, no.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.580
I do want a fucking chicken sandwich now though.

45:11.580 --> 45:12.420
Yeah, I always do.

45:12.420 --> 45:13.260
That's all anybody ever wants.

45:13.260 --> 45:14.580
We cannot rekindle.

45:14.580 --> 45:18.500
We cannot rekindle the flame of war.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.140
We've moved on.

45:21.140 --> 45:24.220
I'm a potter from Brisbane, Australia.

45:24.220 --> 45:27.420
And I come to you, the wisest of boys for advice.

45:27.420 --> 45:29.500
Every time, I'm a man, by the way.

45:29.500 --> 45:30.320
I've changed the word.

45:30.320 --> 45:31.480
Oh, when did that happen?

45:31.480 --> 45:32.700
I'm a man.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.580
We're the man, you say.

45:34.580 --> 45:36.380
I can moan, I'm a man.

45:36.380 --> 45:39.220
Every time I meet someone new and they ask me what I do,

45:39.220 --> 45:41.580
I'm always met with some variation of the same line

45:41.580 --> 45:43.380
when I tell them I'm a potter.

45:43.380 --> 45:46.720
They say, like in Ghost?

45:46.720 --> 45:48.540
This is something I can laugh off at first,

45:48.540 --> 45:50.100
but now I find myself grinding my teeth

45:50.100 --> 45:51.820
waiting for the inevitable ha-ha,

45:51.820 --> 45:53.700
do you and your husband ever do the Ghost thing,

45:53.700 --> 45:55.620
every time I tell them what I do.

45:55.620 --> 45:58.040
Even fellow artists have asked me this.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.580
Brothers, how can I tell me what my profession

45:59.580 --> 46:01.900
without them thinking that I'm getting nasty

46:01.900 --> 46:03.300
with some crazy-swayzee fantasy?

46:03.300 --> 46:05.660
Crazy-swayzee fantasy is pleasurable.

46:05.660 --> 46:06.500
Really fun to say.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.540
Also, should I watch Ghost?

46:08.540 --> 46:13.540
Yeah.

46:13.940 --> 46:16.020
Seems like a culturally relevant flick.

46:16.020 --> 46:18.620
Sorry, that's from Sorry, Ghost.

46:18.620 --> 46:19.840
I don't like you like that.

46:19.840 --> 46:24.140
It's weird you wouldn't check out Ghost.

46:24.140 --> 46:26.580
After a while, Justin, it's a thing.

46:26.580 --> 46:27.780
You've never had this happen to you

46:27.780 --> 46:29.740
where someone's like, oh, you'd love it,

46:29.740 --> 46:31.780
and be like, yeah, I haven't seen it, right?

46:31.780 --> 46:33.580
And it's just become a thing.

46:33.580 --> 46:36.220
I've never seen Avatar, the Avatar movie

46:36.220 --> 46:38.460
with the blue people, never seen it.

46:38.460 --> 46:41.260
Not because I'm opposed to watching it.

46:41.260 --> 46:42.100
I just haven't.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.660
And at this point, what's the right time?

46:44.660 --> 46:47.200
You should feel happy that we don't have a Patreon,

46:47.200 --> 46:48.820
because if we had a Patreon,

46:48.820 --> 46:51.340
you definitely would have watched that movie by now.

46:51.340 --> 46:52.160
That's probably true.

46:52.160 --> 46:54.300
I definitely would have made you do

46:54.300 --> 46:56.620
a commentary track to Avatar.

46:56.620 --> 46:57.860
To this posse, perhaps get a-

46:57.860 --> 46:58.700
The Last Airbender.

46:58.700 --> 47:01.260
Perhaps, no, I would never watch that again.

47:01.260 --> 47:02.380
The TV show, great.

47:02.380 --> 47:03.220
Movie, boo.

47:04.220 --> 47:07.060
Wow, Trav, what a bold, brave stance.

47:07.060 --> 47:11.340
Bold stance that the Last Airbender movie sucks.

47:11.340 --> 47:14.460
Wow, I can't believe he said it.

47:14.460 --> 47:16.020
I said it, that's right.

47:16.020 --> 47:17.560
Welcome to bold takes.

47:18.420 --> 47:22.020
I would say to the Potter, maybe get ahead of it,

47:22.020 --> 47:23.660
and say, yes, I'm a Potter,

47:23.660 --> 47:26.380
and I often do that ghost thing with my husband.

47:26.380 --> 47:28.120
Sometimes I just do it with a ghost.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.460
Nice to meet you.

47:29.460 --> 47:30.820
That could be fun.

47:30.820 --> 47:31.660
Yeah.

47:31.660 --> 47:34.940
You could also say, no, I don't.

47:34.940 --> 47:39.180
It's actually pretty hard to stabilize

47:39.180 --> 47:42.740
some clay you just threw down a wheel

47:42.740 --> 47:46.980
when someone is trying to spoon you,

47:46.980 --> 47:50.660
sort of sitting up spectrally.

47:50.660 --> 47:52.180
I don't know if you guys have ever tried

47:52.180 --> 47:55.900
to spin that good clay, that good wet mud,

47:55.900 --> 47:58.220
to try to make a big urn or face.

47:58.220 --> 48:00.700
It's fucking hard.

48:00.700 --> 48:04.120
You are fighting the centrifugal force

48:04.120 --> 48:07.300
of nature and trying your best

48:07.300 --> 48:10.820
to make it not look bad or wrong,

48:10.820 --> 48:13.940
and you have to really be present.

48:13.940 --> 48:16.700
If you lose concentration for even a second,

48:16.700 --> 48:18.940
that thing is gonna end up splatting against the wall

48:18.940 --> 48:20.460
like a big pizza pie.

48:20.460 --> 48:21.620
I've watched the throw down.

48:21.620 --> 48:22.700
Yeah, absolutely, dude.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.140
And so the last thing you need is someone behind you,

48:25.140 --> 48:27.420
like, you smell good.

48:27.420 --> 48:29.540
Yeah, you don't need the extra hands.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.620
When I'm doing art, I don't need the help.

48:31.620 --> 48:33.620
Thank you, Patrick.

48:33.620 --> 48:35.500
Now, maybe you could just turn it around,

48:35.500 --> 48:37.380
and they're like, do this thing.

48:37.380 --> 48:39.300
And you're like, yeah, no, but what about you?

48:39.300 --> 48:41.160
Do you ever fuck ghosts at your job?

48:41.160 --> 48:42.700
And then see-

48:42.700 --> 48:43.660
That's great.

48:43.660 --> 48:45.260
I don't come to your job and tell you

48:45.260 --> 48:47.100
to fuck ghosts and how to do it.

48:47.100 --> 48:49.040
And now it's a conversation, you know what I mean?

48:49.040 --> 48:50.740
Now we're making friends out here.

48:52.180 --> 48:53.940
Does your partner ever walk up behind you

48:53.940 --> 48:55.820
while you're doing someone's nails or whatever,

48:55.820 --> 48:58.420
and they start spooning you in front of the customers?

48:58.420 --> 49:00.380
No, weird.

49:00.380 --> 49:02.820
Anyways, have you had these hors d'oeuvres?

49:02.820 --> 49:04.940
Does this person meet famous baseball players and like,

49:04.940 --> 49:07.060
so does an angel ever pick you up by the armpit

49:07.060 --> 49:08.180
so you can jump up super high

49:08.180 --> 49:09.860
to catch a home run out of the air?

49:09.860 --> 49:12.660
No, I think, but the difference there is, Griff,

49:12.660 --> 49:15.860
we have a lot of different ways of thinking about baseball.

49:15.860 --> 49:19.260
For some reason, they did this one wild thing

49:19.260 --> 49:20.620
in a Swayze movie once,

49:20.620 --> 49:22.860
and it's all anybody knows about pottery.

49:22.860 --> 49:26.740
Yeah, we need to get more pottery references

49:26.740 --> 49:28.100
out there in society.

49:28.100 --> 49:32.300
The problem is I'm thinking about a pottery-based movie,

49:32.300 --> 49:34.500
and I need myself bored.

49:34.500 --> 49:36.980
Like, just with a single thought.

49:36.980 --> 49:39.500
And I'm not saying that pottery is boring.

49:39.500 --> 49:41.140
I'm saying that watching it-

49:41.140 --> 49:42.180
Pottery is boring.

49:42.180 --> 49:43.380
Pottery is boring, thank you.

49:43.380 --> 49:45.500
Here's what you do, Griffin, you make a pottery movie,

49:45.500 --> 49:49.620
and you add in a beefy, sexy partner

49:49.620 --> 49:51.340
that comes over and sits behind them,

49:51.340 --> 49:53.340
and oh, fuck, no, I did it again.

49:53.340 --> 49:54.460
I tried to fix it up.

49:54.460 --> 49:56.100
You made a sexy ghost movie again.

49:56.100 --> 49:57.900
It is really sexy when people do that.

49:57.900 --> 50:01.100
What if instead of a ghost, it's a mummy?

50:01.100 --> 50:03.500
Oh, now that's going to be a problem

50:03.500 --> 50:05.580
because it's going to get the bandages real dirty.

50:05.580 --> 50:07.780
Well, the bandage is going to get stuck to the vase,

50:07.780 --> 50:09.180
and it's going to unwrap the mummy.

50:09.180 --> 50:11.620
He's going to spin around really, really fast

50:11.620 --> 50:14.100
and turn into just skeleton bones.

50:14.100 --> 50:16.540
And then the bones are going to collapse,

50:16.540 --> 50:18.500
and then you turn to the camera and say,

50:18.500 --> 50:19.940
no bones about it.

50:19.940 --> 50:23.060
That would actually be a good way of ending the conversation

50:23.060 --> 50:24.780
if you were just like,

50:24.780 --> 50:26.860
no, but here's a-

50:26.860 --> 50:30.100
No, but I am horny for mummies, if you're curious.

50:30.100 --> 50:32.540
Now, what if it was a vampire, and they're doing it,

50:32.540 --> 50:34.740
and they're already in a position to bite that neck, right?

50:34.740 --> 50:37.140
So as you're doing it together, they're also draining you.

50:37.140 --> 50:40.220
And then they pass out, and the pot falls off and breaks,

50:40.220 --> 50:42.740
and then the vampire says, well, this sucks, right?

50:42.740 --> 50:43.980
And then it's like-

50:43.980 --> 50:45.180
Justin, you do one now?

50:46.260 --> 50:48.460
I don't actually understand the-

50:48.460 --> 50:50.060
Okay, so I'll give you another example.

50:50.060 --> 50:53.780
A Frankenstein monster comes up behind you,

50:53.780 --> 50:58.780
and he just tries to do it, but he squishes it,

50:58.780 --> 51:02.460
and then it rips one of his zombie arms off,

51:02.460 --> 51:04.060
and throws it across the room.

51:04.060 --> 51:05.940
And he's like, hey, can you give me a hand?

51:05.940 --> 51:06.780
Oh, that's pretty good.

51:06.780 --> 51:08.740
So that's the construction of the joke, Justin.

51:08.740 --> 51:11.220
Now you can do one, because I know you know other monsters.

51:11.220 --> 51:12.420
It's a mummy.

51:12.420 --> 51:13.380
I already did a mummy one.

51:13.380 --> 51:15.700
We've done mummy, vampire, and a Frankenstein monster,

51:15.700 --> 51:16.540
so go ahead.

51:16.540 --> 51:17.820
I did want to do a different mummy one, though.

51:17.820 --> 51:18.660
Okay, okay.

51:18.660 --> 51:19.480
We'll try, we'll see.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.500
It's like a reboot of the mummy.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.040
Oh, sure, this is the mummy too?

51:23.040 --> 51:23.880
Okay.

51:23.880 --> 51:25.820
No, it's a reboot of the mummy, it's different.

51:25.820 --> 51:27.340
With Tom Cruise.

51:27.340 --> 51:30.340
He's helping, who's in our reboot?

51:31.540 --> 51:34.540
Probably Rooney Mara, and he's helping her.

51:34.540 --> 51:36.900
Oh my god, Justin, that was really good, actually.

51:36.900 --> 51:37.860
Yeah, this is a good poll.

51:37.860 --> 51:39.500
That is who would be in the ghost reboot.

51:39.500 --> 51:42.380
That's exactly who would be in mummy.

51:42.380 --> 51:44.460
He's doing it for like a long time,

51:44.460 --> 51:47.400
and then he's like, can we wrap this up?

51:47.400 --> 51:48.940
Oh, that's pretty good.

51:48.940 --> 51:52.020
That's good, but something has to happen to him violent.

51:52.020 --> 51:54.020
Some violent thing has to happen to him in your response.

51:54.020 --> 51:56.660
But then she's like, you know how Rooney Mara

51:56.660 --> 51:58.860
always talks, and she's like, sure!

51:58.860 --> 52:01.820
And then she jams one end of his thing

52:01.820 --> 52:03.260
into the pottery wheel, and he starts like.

52:03.260 --> 52:04.100
His thing?

52:04.100 --> 52:06.820
Wait, wait, wait, Rooney Mara craps his dick

52:06.820 --> 52:07.660
and shuts it? She takes the end

52:07.660 --> 52:09.500
of the wrapping into the pottery,

52:09.500 --> 52:12.460
and it starts spinning, but then it's spinning him around,

52:12.460 --> 52:14.500
right, it's spinning the mummy around,

52:14.500 --> 52:16.820
and peeling off his wrapping, and it's just bones.

52:16.820 --> 52:17.660
Okay.

52:17.660 --> 52:18.480
And they fall to the ground.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.320
Now it's a skeleton.

52:19.320 --> 52:23.160
And then she's like, well, that was a boner, wasn't it?

52:23.160 --> 52:24.000
Oh, wait.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.140
She does two different voices in the movie?

52:26.140 --> 52:27.780
And two different puns?

52:27.780 --> 52:30.020
She's possessed by Helen Mirren's ghost,

52:30.020 --> 52:32.620
because it's teaching the mummy how to live.

52:32.620 --> 52:34.980
All right, all right, all right, okay.

52:34.980 --> 52:35.820
I love those.

52:35.820 --> 52:38.540
So you knew that Matthew McConaughey plays the mummy.

52:38.540 --> 52:39.980
I knew it!

52:39.980 --> 52:41.540
You guessed that already, Griff.

52:41.540 --> 52:42.380
Yeah.

52:42.380 --> 52:44.400
Okay, now a werewolf comes in.

52:44.400 --> 52:45.240
Yeah.

52:45.240 --> 52:47.620
And the werewolf sits behind her, and they're doing it,

52:47.620 --> 52:50.780
and then it stops, and she's like, what happened?

52:50.780 --> 52:54.240
He goes, oh, I just had two paws.

52:54.240 --> 52:59.240
So a cyborg comes in, and immediately crushes the vase

53:01.840 --> 53:03.360
as soon as he touches it.

53:03.360 --> 53:04.200
Yeah.

53:04.200 --> 53:09.200
And he looks at him, and he's like, this mega bites.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.720
Oh, that's very good.

53:12.720 --> 53:15.120
Now what would it be if a doll came in, Griffin?

53:17.120 --> 53:20.800
He would come in, and hold on, let me think of a funny joke.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.520
Okay, give him a minute, Justin.

53:22.520 --> 53:23.520
Just back off, okay?

53:23.520 --> 53:24.440
Give him a second.

53:25.560 --> 53:26.720
Justin, just calm down.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.340
He's thinking, I can see it on his face.

53:28.340 --> 53:31.240
He's got it, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, here it comes.

53:31.240 --> 53:33.640
Oh, here it comes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:33.640 --> 53:35.440
Here it comes, baby.

53:36.960 --> 53:41.960
So he would come in, and he doesn't have arms or hands,

53:44.800 --> 53:46.620
and so he would probably just look at it,

53:46.620 --> 53:51.080
and he would be like, such beauty does not compute.

53:51.080 --> 53:55.800
Beep, boop, bop, and then his shell explodes,

53:55.800 --> 54:00.800
and the dog man inside of that pilots it pops out,

54:01.280 --> 54:04.640
and smashes through a window, and runs off,

54:04.640 --> 54:08.680
and then Doctor Who shows up, and he has a gun,

54:08.680 --> 54:10.200
and he runs into the room, and he's like,

54:10.200 --> 54:12.080
which way did he go?

54:12.080 --> 54:15.280
And then she's like, the dog man ran out the window,

54:15.280 --> 54:16.600
and you see him go to the window,

54:16.600 --> 54:19.600
and just fire off a few rounds, and then he looks back,

54:19.600 --> 54:21.400
and he's like, I got it.

54:22.600 --> 54:27.280
And then he comes up behind Rooney Mara,

54:27.280 --> 54:30.840
and he sets the, first off, he sets the gun down,

54:30.840 --> 54:33.880
and then he is like, and let's try this again,

54:33.880 --> 54:37.160
but we'll use some of my space clay,

54:37.160 --> 54:40.380
and he sets down space clay on the wheel,

54:40.380 --> 54:45.000
and when it spins this time, it doesn't just make a vase,

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
it makes, instead of just making a vase,

54:50.640 --> 54:53.800
it makes a mirror, a little mirror,

54:53.800 --> 54:55.460
and when you look inside of it,

54:56.760 --> 54:58.920
you see the moment of your death.

55:00.560 --> 55:04.360
And this is my new movie, Ghost.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.120
Okay, wait, hold on.

55:07.120 --> 55:09.920
You've lost it, you've lost it, and we've lost it,

55:09.920 --> 55:11.920
and by it, I mean the time that we had a lot of.

55:11.920 --> 55:13.440
Darth Vader comes in.

55:13.440 --> 55:17.160
Okay, thank you, Griffin, I really appreciate you

55:17.160 --> 55:18.000
for that great back contribution.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.880
How many hands are on the mirror at this point, Griffin?

55:20.880 --> 55:23.040
It's not a mirror anymore, it went back to being a vase.

55:23.040 --> 55:23.960
Oh, okay, cool, cool, cool.

55:23.960 --> 55:27.360
This is our podcast, and we very much appreciate you

55:27.360 --> 55:30.440
being here, I hope you've got that new Montaigne album.

55:30.440 --> 55:33.760
Good lord almighty, it fucking slaps good.

55:33.760 --> 55:35.720
It slaps real good.

55:35.720 --> 55:37.600
They did a real nice job on that one.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.120
They did a great job cranking that one out.

55:39.120 --> 55:42.640
Oh, yeah, great, and what's the name of that one?

55:42.640 --> 55:44.760
Where can we find it, where can we find it?

55:44.760 --> 55:46.160
If you search Montaigne.

55:46.160 --> 55:47.920
If you search Montaigne, it'll pop up.

55:47.920 --> 55:52.720
Point, but the new album is called Making It.

55:52.720 --> 55:56.040
It's got a very cool cover, it's got lots of good songs.

55:56.040 --> 55:57.520
I mean, come on, it's a slam.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.520
Power ranking of the songs, I'm gonna say,

55:59.520 --> 56:01.600
now in space, still number one, up in my book,

56:01.600 --> 56:03.600
I like In the Green Room, strong start.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.980
Of course, you can't always be you with David Byrne.

56:07.880 --> 56:10.840
Just a fucking great album.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.320
Y'all have to listen to this one.

56:12.320 --> 56:15.080
I'm very excited that she put J.C.Ultra on it too.

56:15.080 --> 56:16.720
Yes, absolutely.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.720
Hey, thank you to Max 1 Fun.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.000
Fun fact, actually fun fact about J.C.Ultra.

56:21.960 --> 56:24.080
Montaigne sent J.C.Ultra to us

56:24.080 --> 56:28.480
when we first started talking about doing the theme song.

56:28.480 --> 56:30.880
Montaigne sent a demo of J.C.Ultra,

56:30.880 --> 56:33.520
and she was like, what do you think of this energy,

56:33.520 --> 56:35.960
this vibe, and I was like, that's fantastic.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.320
But that was the song that I'd heard

56:37.320 --> 56:39.120
where I was like, yes, she has to, anyway,

56:39.120 --> 56:41.040
that's on the album, it's one of the good songs.

56:41.040 --> 56:44.480
Thank you to Max 1 Fun for having us on the network.

56:44.480 --> 56:47.000
Lots of great shows there, lots of great jokes,

56:47.000 --> 56:51.400
and lots of good education too.

56:51.400 --> 56:53.400
They got jokes, education,

56:53.400 --> 56:55.300
sports, sports.

56:56.200 --> 56:59.040
Some hot takes in there as well.

56:59.040 --> 57:01.640
Oh, we have some live shows coming up

57:01.640 --> 57:03.080

57:03.080 --> 57:06.080

Thanks for listening, y'all.

58:09.560 --> 58:10.640
You're welcome.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.360
Griffin, did you have an inspirational quote

58:12.360 --> 58:13.520
for us to wrap it all up?

58:13.520 --> 58:16.160
Yeah, don't let anybody push you around.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.360
Don't let anybody push you around into doing bits

58:18.360 --> 58:19.960
that you don't wanna do anymore.

58:21.120 --> 58:23.400
Don't let anybody tell you you have to do bits

58:23.400 --> 58:24.880
that you don't wanna do anymore.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.600
Cause you don't fucking have to.

58:26.600 --> 58:27.440
Got it.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.280
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:29.120 --> 58:32.640
You were here at the same time as everyone else.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.640
You were here at the same time as everyone else.

58:34.640 --> 58:36.400
You don't, it's not like you were last

58:36.400 --> 58:37.840
to call your seat in the car.

58:37.840 --> 58:39.440
And so you have to do a bit at the end of the show

58:39.440 --> 58:40.280
for 12 fucking years.

58:40.280 --> 58:42.400
My brother, my brother, me.

58:42.400 --> 58:43.240
Kiss your dad somewhere on the lips.

58:43.240 --> 58:44.760
You don't have to do that anymore.

58:44.760 --> 59:05.680
It's better with you.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.360
It's better with you.

59:08.360 --> 59:15.160
My life is better with you.
