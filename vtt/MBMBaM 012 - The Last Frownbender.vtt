WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm still free, take your chance on me

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
If you got no place to go when the pretty birds have flown

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm still free, take your chance on me

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
If you got no place to go when the pretty birds have flown

00:46.000 --> 00:56.000
If you got no place to go when the pretty birds have flown

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I wish you guys would have told me this before I took all the epic act

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh, I'm Justin McRoy by the way

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm Travis McRoy

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm Griffin McRoy

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Hey, can you guys hear me over there?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Can you hear me all the way out on the east coast?

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Griffin's rocking it Midwest style these days, he's moved to...

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm up in that bread basket dog

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I finally got his piece of the pie

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, I did, it's so nice out here

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
No

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
No, scary

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Can I come back please?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Have you seen any gangs?

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
It's so hot all the time, the gangs and wild dogs just right across the street

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
I don't like it here anymore

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Oh man, okay, so here we go

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
This is the first question, it's from FormSpring

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
My university flatmates have gone home for the summer

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
What are you, where are you from?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Flatmates?

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
However, I have a summer placement

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
What can I do to stop becoming too bored or going slightly crazy?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I don't understand half of the words in this question

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I don't speak the same language as you

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
A summer placement, flatmates?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I think that means they have summer classes

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I know what you can do to help pass the time

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Get an English dictionary and memorize it

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
So you call things the right names

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Or maybe just move to Merca

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Move to Merca

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
This would be the best day to do it

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
America's birthday

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Greatest day

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
How old is old lady liberty?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
60, 70 years old, who can keep track?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I believe you mean 70 years young

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
70 years young

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
You know, being bored

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
I remember those days

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I remember when I would worry about being bored

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Who has time to be bored anymore?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Are you sleeping enough?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Set yourself up some kind of random project

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
This summer I am going to read 16 books

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I am going to build a cabinet

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Open a lemonade stand

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
A lemonade stand for grown-ups

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Only Mike's Hard Lemonade

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, what's up?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That'd be good

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
That's got to be legal

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Refreshing

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I like your house's suggestion

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
Say by the end of this summer you are going to kick ass at photography

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Or kung fu or something

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And use your time that way

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Or street side bartending

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Or just treasure these days because soon you won't be bored

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Ever again

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Soon you'll be dead

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It's the best time to go exploring too

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Go exploring?

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah, if you are in a college town and everyone is left for the summer

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
You can go to all kinds of places

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Or you can just go on a rampage

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Just go on a looting rampage because nobody is there

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
Yeah, say by the end of this summer I am going to break into 16 houses

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Goals are so important

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Goal setting is so important

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
So I got a problem

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Oh no

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I am in a situation

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I love this girl

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I work with her

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Also I am a random person on forum spring

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
But she has a boyfriend

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
That is a problem

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That is a problem

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
She has told me she likes it

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Let me start at the beginning because I feel like we have gotten confused

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I am in a situation

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I love this girl I work with but she has a boyfriend

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
She has told me she likes me and wants to date me

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
But she doesn't want to lose what she has with her current boyfriend

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
But I really want to date her

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
What?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
What should I do?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Okay, so alright

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
She is with

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Okay, you love girl A

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Girl A is dating girl B

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Or boy

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Guy B

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Wait

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Lesbian apocalypse

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
It is coming so quickly

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Is it a girl?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I don't know

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
So

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Dude

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I have a bigger problem with this question

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And it is that he starts with I love this girl I work with

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yikes

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, dude

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
You are rushing

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Here is the thing

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
If she is with this guy

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
And she also wants to be with you

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Then they are hopefully going to self-destruct

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
But you need to tell her that if she wants to be with you

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
You are better than that

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
She needs to drop the proverbial zero

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And get with the proverbial hero

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
But don't let her string you along like this

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
If she wants to be with you she needs to dump that dude

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
I know it sucks

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I know he is going to cry and sit in her shitty mixtape for a week

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Sorry

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
But it sounds like she is setting up

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
If she wants a little booty on the side

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
If she is making the statement

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah, I want to be with you

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
But I don't want to lose what I have with my current boyfriend

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
A, that is a really shitty thing to say

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
B, what she is setting up is

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
But we can still hang out

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Is that what you want to be, FormSpring?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
You want to be a side booty?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
You know, I knew a guy with a side booty once

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
It is really tragic, I shouldn't joke about it

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It is a serious medical problem

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
What is that stain on the side of your pants?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I am sorry, I have a side booty

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
And I have no control over it

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Because my destiny is not wired properly

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I absorbed one tenth of a twin

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
And I just got one of his butt cheeks

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
So he has

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Wait, let's jump back

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
So he has two butts

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
One on the back, one on the side

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
It is more of a one and a half situation

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, the one on the side doesn't count as much

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
It is like a side butt, but it is only like half a butt

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Because you don't have room for a full butt on the side of your body

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
God, biology 101 Travis

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I am sorry, I wasn't paying attention that day

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
They can fix that with a pretty simple outpatient procedure

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Ask your doctor wife about it

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
Jacob via Gmail asks, recently at a camp out with a couple of friends in my backyard

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
In the Canadian woods, I got really close to a girl

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
My friend has been chasing for a while

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
And ended up hooking up with her without anyone else noticing

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I like that verbiage

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Should I tell my butt or keep it a secret?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Tell your butt

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Jacob

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
What can I say, nice ninja hooking up first of all

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
Jacob has the ability to turn invisible like a chameleon whenever he is fully aroused

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
Jacob, I think that this story is so cool that you just need to write it out

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Because you don't want to taint it by telling your friend

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
I think you need to keep this a secret in your heart when things are down

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
Just think about that time that you covertly snuck into a girl

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
And hooked up with her

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Here is my question, did she notice?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Because you have a sincere problem

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I think you should go ahead and tell him

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Because if you were that stealth about it, then he probably won't believe you

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And he'll just turn it into a joke and he'll diffuse the whole situation

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, I would never tell anybody

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah, keep it to yourself

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
And keep up the discreet lovemaking

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Because that's a skill that you're going to exercise more often than you might think

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
This is one situation where I kind of wish this guy would start an advice podcast

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Where he could ask him about his secret lovemaking

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
I was in the middle of a group of friends, but I really wanted to bone down on this girl

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
What should I wear?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
One of my friends was like, did you feel a breeze?

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
And the other one said no, but I made love for an hour

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And you were unaware

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
This is the guy who set up the popcorn dick trick

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Cut a hole in the bottom of the popcorn

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I like this guy

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
What's up with that language?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I can't say popcorn?

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
It's America's birthday, could we maybe keep it down a little?

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
Yahoo Answers user Jessica asks, can I hit American men?

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
She expounds, hi, I am Jessica from France

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And this fall I will be going to college in the US

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I just wondered, if dirty American boy tries to hit on me

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Can I slap him hard in the mouth with clenched fists so his yellow teeth breaks?

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Only French man can touch this, will this get me in trouble?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
No, I think that's fine

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah, I don't know much about the law

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I mean, if you make his yellow teeth breaks

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
Then he could make you pay for it, the operation

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Listen, on this, America's birthday, I feel like I have to be the one to say

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
Jessica, you would be lucky, lucky to have some American penis, go on

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Again with the language

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I said penis this time, how is that not better?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It's like weirder, it's grosser

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Is it grosser?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
It's grosser degrees

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
You're making me more and more uncomfortable

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm going to eat some American wieners later

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
But those are called freedom franks because we can't say French dogs anymore

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So they're freedom franks

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Like we all used to

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
If he comes to the US and hits an American man in the mouth, I'll go to war with France

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
It'll be my own private campaign

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Your own private campaign

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Do you think Tristan would come help you out with that?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Tristan's going to come and he's going to fuck Jessica up

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Right now I can picture Tristan listening to this podcast and hearing that question

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
And just start smearing on war paint and tying a bandana around his head

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, now it's time to go get Jessica too

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
He's going to hog tie Jessica and use Jessica to beat Osama to death

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
It's going to be totally awesome

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
I think Jacob just had sex with me

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
Wow, I did not see that coming

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
There's a joke in there somewhere

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
No, I'm seeing something coming

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
No, go on

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
On America's birthday, Travis

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I work with many interesting people

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
This is not true of me, this is Dan from Gmail

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
It is true of me, I'm just not the one talking

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It's not my question

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
One in particular has a disturbing mustache that looks like he would drive an ice cream truck and have a basement full of children

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
How do I nicely inform him that his mustache is a sad and failed attempt at having facial hair?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Oh, the pedo stache, that's tough

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
I don't understand, so he's a part time ice cream truck driver and a part time day care attendee?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Dead children

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Or maybe the children are manufacturing the ice cream for him

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
He has a slave labor thing going on in his basement

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
I don't think we should jump to pedo conclusions

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Let's give this guy the benefit of the doubt

12:05.000 --> 12:12.000
You think that he's worried because the guy that he works with is interesting but looks like he might run a small business

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
And also employ local children and be infusing cash into the economy, that's what you think

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
That's what he's worried about

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
The American economy

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Happy birthday America

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Thank you America

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Thank you America for everything

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Such a good country

12:30.000 --> 12:38.000
I think this would be such an awkward conversation that what you need to do is sneak into his house when he's asleep

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Shave it off when he's not paying attention

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
And then just say, what happened the next day?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
If I might suggest, get Jacob's help

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah, get Jacob's help, he's really good with stealth

12:49.000 --> 13:00.000
I can't grow hair in the area underneath the corners of my mouth

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Which makes it hard to go with a full goatee

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
And sort of ends up with a half van dyke, half pedo stash

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
It's a no-tee

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's a no-tee

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
And I sympathize with this guy

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Because it's every man's right to have facial hair

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Only some people are better at it than others

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Travis has a full luscious beard that you could hide skittles and jolly ranchers in

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
To recall for later snacking

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
But I can't get that going

13:32.000 --> 13:40.000
Dan, if I might suggest, start posting pictures in your cubicle of men with these pedo stashes

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Guys like this, until eventually this guy

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Now, this will reflect poorly on you

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
So you need to be ready for that

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
But I think that's the only way to do it without just saying

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Hey creep stash, how's your creep stash?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
The best way to deal with a creep stash is say

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
At any opportunity, say, God, your mustache looks so good

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
And like really let him know

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
And then say, you know what, I love your stash

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And if he's into it, if he's feeling you

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Okay, if he's not feeling it, he's like, oh man

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
This guy is hitting on me for my stash, I'm gonna shave it

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
If he is into it, then say, God, you know what though

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
As much as I love your stash, you look so good with like

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
A little beard, just a little beard coming down off of it

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
And then he'll grow it

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
What if you had a mustache, but it was made of skin

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Like a skin stash

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
There wasn't any hair there

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And it was just skin that blended with your other skin

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
That would look so good if you had a skin stash

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
That would look so, so good

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
So, I hope that helps

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Brendan from Gmail says, I was walking with probably best friend

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
She has made it clear that I am in her friend's circle

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Although the way she said it also said that to who is not

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Okay, nope

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Nope

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Sorry Brendan, maybe get that stuff right

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I can't do this with you

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Tyler from Gmail writes, my friend and I live in LA

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
We love it

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
Whatever he talks about going to any place outside the city

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
He refers to it as going down to whateversburg

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Regardless of the town's location, north or south of Los Angeles

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Does he also say that regardless of the name of the area you're going to

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Going down to whateversburg

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
That tells me nothing

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
There's no information in that sentence

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
You say that every time we go anywhere

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Likewise, if we're heading into the city from some place north

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
He says heading up to LA

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
So to recap, he thinks that if you're going to a bigger city

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Then you call it going up to that place

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Even though the larger city may be located more southern on the actual globe

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Even on the same latitude

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
He listened to the show and his name is Mark

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
Please tell me he's wrong so I can have this one trivial but incontrovertible moment

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Of being right to lord over him for all of time

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Help me Mo Bim Bam, you're my only hope

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Tyler from Gmail

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Okay, let me think about this

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
Tyler, I'm sorry but I feel what Mark is spitting

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
I understand it because it has nothing to do with geography

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
He's talking about moving up and down the socio-economic ladder

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
So if you move from Shitsville to LA

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
That is an upward move on the ladder

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
So you're moving on up to LA

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
What is this ladder that there are places below Los Angeles

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I'm figuratively speaking

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
If we're talking about this soul crushing ladder

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
LA is the bottom rung

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Because it's the most oppressive city on the planet

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
Now you don't mean that, Las Vegas still exists

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
Los Angeles, you're a fine city

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
You need to get a little smaller

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
And make it so the traffic isn't so bad

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
And then we'll talk again

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And make everybody less hateful

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I think people are nice to me there

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Do you think it's because you're white?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
That probably, maybe, I don't know

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
Everyone there is very friendly I think in Los Angeles

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
To get back to Tyler's actual question

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
I have to agree with your friend Mark

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I think that up and down are interchangeable

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
And have nothing to do with actual location

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Would you prefer if he was like

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm going to head up north on California 1

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
For 364 miles until I reach my destination

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Which is LAX

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I always use the right words

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Is that you, Wood?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Like directionally?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I always say I'm heading

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I don't say I'm going to Cincinnati

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
I say I'm headed north-northwest

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
You don't do that

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Yeah I do, sure

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
As the crow flies

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
You know what I would like to hear

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Those ones that are on the same plane

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
The same latitude

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Say I'm heading left to someplace

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm going up north, down south

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Left, right

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I'm going right

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Yahoo Answers user Steph P. asks

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Is it possible to bend air, water, fire, and earth

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Like in Avatar?

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
If so, please help me learn how to

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Subquestion

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Like in the show Avatar

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Yes, the answer, of course

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It's also possible to bend sadness

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
And you've got that down

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
She's the last of the sadness benders

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
You've bent my mouth into a frown

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
A disapproving frown

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Steph P. the frown bender

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I can't wait to see M. Night Shyamalan

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Ruin that franchise

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Don't say that

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I hope it's so good

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
It's not

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
It's got like a 6%

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Have you seen Last Airbender?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
That shit rules

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Shyamalan

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Shyamalan

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Shyamalan

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Shyamalan

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Shyamalian

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
forms

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Chameleonare

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Chameleonare asks

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
What are your guys' stance on the changing of last names

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
When people get married?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
My current girlfriend just told me

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
That if we ever got married

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
She would be keeping her last name

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
She claims it's a sexist tradition

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Should I be offended?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Just say

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
You know what else is a sexist tradition

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
It would be paying for dinner

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
So pony up

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Say that

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
And then she'd be like

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, we always do that

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
You'd be like

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
God, I'm sorry

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I'm such an asshole

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Can you forgive me?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I mean

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Is it a sexist tradition?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I don't know

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Is it everything?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Isn't everything?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
What?

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Isn't every tradition inherently sexist?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Like you bring a Christmas tree in

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That's just a phallus

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
It's just one

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
A big green leafy

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Just a big green leafy phallus

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
See, that's the words we use, Travis

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Phallus

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Phallus is less creepy

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
That's the least creepy one

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
That's scientific

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
That's hospital talk

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I think wiener is pretty scientific

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Oh my god

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Oh my god

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
He's saying it again

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I mean

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
Her preference is the most important thing, right?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
So if

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
I don't think she's the sort of lady who is independent

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
About not changing her name

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Until two guys

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Three guys who are brothers

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
And record a podcast

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Tell her differently

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
So I think you're just going to have to ride this one out

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
That said

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
If you were going to do a compromise

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
You see my wife's name

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
She took her last name and made it her middle name

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And then took my last name

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
So we'd have

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I think it's nice that married couples have the same last names

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Because I think it's

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Yeah

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I think beyond being

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Whether or not it's a sexist tradition

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
I think that it is nice for them to

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Have

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
If they're starting a family

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Then they want to be the whatevers

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Sure

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
I think this issue really boils down ultimately

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
To what the last name in question is

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I guess if it's

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
If it's like

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
J.P. Gargle Stinch

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Like

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I can understand you not wanting

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
But if it's like Hogan

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
If your last name's Hogan

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Like what woman wouldn't want to have that as their last name

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Right

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And I think you should also explain to her

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
That she should be prepared

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
That for the rest of your lives together

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
You will always be introduced separately

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And everything will be addressed to you separately

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And there will always be that confusion of

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
It would be awkward

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Like this is Mrs. Gargle Stouch

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And her husband

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Tom Danger

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Like well Mrs. Gargle Stouch what didn't you

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Never mind

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
And she can't be Mrs.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
She can't be Mrs.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Can you be Mrs. if you don't take their last name

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I think so

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I think Mrs. just indicates that you're married

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Mizz-rizz

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Mizz-rizz

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Mizz

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Mizz-mires

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Mizz-rizz

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Formspring asks

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I just started seeing this guy and I feel uncomfortable

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Whenever he tries to take my shirt off

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I like him a lot but I'm not a skinny girl

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And I feel like he won't like what he sees underneath

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
Do men even care or do they just want boobs

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Good news

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
Listen the doctor just came out of the room

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
You've been sitting there in the waiting room

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
With bated breath waiting for something

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And Dr. Travis has good news for you

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Men like boobs

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
There you go

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
It doesn't matter to me

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
What if these are not two connected thoughts

22:28.000 --> 22:35.000
We're assuming that she means she's a little bit chunky style underneath

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
And that's why she's worried what he'll see

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Maybe she's got like a really tragic

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
Maybe she's got like a giant tattoo of Ray Romano or something

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Maybe she's got a side butt but it's on her torso

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
Oh my god a torso side butt and you're embarrassed that he'll see it

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
Listen if he loves you he's gonna have to deal with the fact that you have half a butt on the side of your body

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
And a tattoo of Ray Romano

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I understand you were attached to it

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Maybe have it surgically lowered so it'll just look like you have great childbearing hips

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Why would having a tattoo of Ray Romano lower make it look like you have great childbearing hips

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I'm really confused

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
It's about perspective

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It's hard to explain

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
If he loves you it won't matter and if he doesn't love you don't give it up

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
There it is man

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Lock it up, lock it down

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Words never spoken

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Protect that carnal treasure

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
That's right that's your flower

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
Does anyone here find Michael Cera really attractive

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Sorry that was a yahoo question

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
You need to prep this shit like that Griffin

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
I didn't want to dedicate too much time to it so I just dropped it like it was hot

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I don't know why but I really really like him

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I just think it's his amazing personality lol

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Go creepo you're the only one

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
No I think he's cute

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
He's a cute little guy

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
The thing is he's 50

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
It's getting a little old, a little tired

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
He needs to bust out of his shell a little bit

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Ye three brothers

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
My best friend is a bit of a dick

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Again with this talk

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
He takes the piss out of it

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
He takes the piss out of everything I say and bitches about me constantly

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
How could I put him in his place

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
Okay welcome back to fucking class 1000

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
A continuing series on my brother my brother news called are you my friend

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
Class 1 was of course if you want to really have sex with your best friend's girlfriend really bad

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
That's not your friend

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
You're not friends that's not what that means

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
Class 2 if your best friend makes fun of everything you say and bitches about you

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
He's not your friend

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Find a new friend

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
What kind of confidence issues do you have

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Where this guy is picking on you all the time and makes fun of you and bitches about you

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
You're like that's my best bud

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
That's my bro

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
A lifetime bro forever

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
He has my best interest in mind

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
I know that he pees all over me and sets my stuff on fire and kicks me in the face

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
But god I love him

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Hey Tony you're a pussy

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Thanks Mike

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
That's my best friend

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
How many more boxes do you think we have to move to your apartment

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
I'll tell you when you move enough boxes gay

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
That's my best friend

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
That's my man

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Who's that man abusing you

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Do you want me to call the cops now we're bros

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
We're best friends

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
That said

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Hey Jerry I fucked your dad

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Oh Mike

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Thanks

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Why'd you do that

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
How about you just tell him to stop being a dick

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Stop being a dick

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Just slug him once

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Just slug him once

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
And see how the tenure of the relationship changes

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I bet it'll be drastic

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Real good for that friendship

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You guys are so chipper and gleeful

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
You're never down

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
How do you do this

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
This dovetails

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
This dovetails with another question that's from Matt

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
The theory of you seem to be great terms as adults

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Were you always good friends or does that

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Amicable nature of family just

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Naturally reveal itself after you no longer

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Have to share a living space

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Yep

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
These questions are tied in because

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
You don't know us

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
We're animals, we're monsters

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
This show

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Is our ticket

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
To the big time, to the big money

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
And we know that we're the only three people

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
We know that will be on it with us

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
So we

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
We act chipper

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
But usually we're hateful

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And misanthrope

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
This question reminds me of people who are like

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That Matt Lauer seems so nice

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Well that's his job

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
That's what he gets paid to do

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Our job is to make it seem like we like each other

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
And that we're chipper

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
They're lying by the way

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
We're chipper and gleeful because we

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Enjoy talking to each other

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I'll tell you straight up

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Stone Cold

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
This is from Matt

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Matt I'll tell you something

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Man you only get one go around

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
You only get one spin

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
On this crazy globe

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Why waste a moment of it

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Not one more moment of it being

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Anything but chipper and gleeful

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I have a great reason to be chipper and gleeful

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
It's because I woke up today

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
You know what I have a new thing that I've been trying

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
To do for like the last year, year and a half, two years

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And whenever I start to get frustrated

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
About something or upset about something I stop

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
And I think is this really worth getting

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Upset about and the answer is always

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
No, you know in

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Two minutes it's gonna be over anyways

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Might as well ride

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
The happy wave

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
If that doesn't work just go buy

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Something

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
That's what I do

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
I'll go back to my original point and

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Make that something just a little bit

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Of speed

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Just a little bit of

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Upper, maybe just one rock

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Just one rock of rock cocaine

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
But it's important that you promise yourself

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Great speed powder, just the one

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Maybe just a little

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Bit of nose whiskey

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
We'll turn that frown upside down

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
As a woman what is

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
The best way to seduce a man?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Say hi, I can't answer that

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
As a man the best way to seduce a man

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Goes a little something

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Like this

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Then it's

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
On, just like that I don't know

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
That's all you need, just make that noise

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
And the guy's like you're down

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Then you're like I'm down, clearly I'm down

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
As a woman, what seduction

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
What do you mean, there's no seduction

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
There's no, I mean this is

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
A crazy concept

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Men are stupid, just

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Penises attached to brains, I'm sorry Griffin

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
And it

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Takes very little

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
What's the best way to seduce a dude guys?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I think maybe a little bit of

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I think maybe a little bit of clarity

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Will come out of

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
This related yahoo question

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Which comes to us from Mr. H

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Who asks, exactly how

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Can I get horny?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I don't

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I don't get it

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I look at something sexual and dirty

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
And then what, do I have to have a specific

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Mindset to get fully horny?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I tried saying over and over

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
In my head, oh god I want that so

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Badly, or something like that

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
That didn't help

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Am I supposed to get a big emotional feeling when I

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Get horny? Is it like my heartbeat

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Changes during horniness?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
What aspect of the

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Dirty thought is supposed to make me horny?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
I looked at something that made me

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Horny, but it only worked for a few seconds

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
And then it went away

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And sometimes it doesn't work at all

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
What do I have to do to keep the feeling?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
This is once again something a psychopath

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Says

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Signed Kyle H5

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Someone give me a real answer

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Nothing like, you'll know when it happens

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
That's the most

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Upsetting thing I've ever heard

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Clearly dating

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Clearly these two are

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
She doesn't know how to seduce a man, and he does not

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Understand horny

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
He doesn't understand how to be seduced

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
That question

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
By the way, came to us from

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Tyler, who sent it in

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Thank you Tyler

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
That's a good one, good looking out money

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Good looking out money

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I think this might have been

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Sent to us by Beesbow, or some other

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Extraterrestrial force that doesn't understand

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
How horny impulses work

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I think just

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Scientifically speaking, if you ever said

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
To yourself, oh I'm down

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
To bone, then you're probably horny right then

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
You don't need to, there's no

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Horny fairy that comes down and says to you

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
You are on

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
You are on and ready for game

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Dear horny fairy, please send me

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
A boner, it's all I want

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Just one please

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Send me a bone

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Give just one boner to

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Me

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
My advice to both of these people, the young people

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
And the former string person

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
In my experience

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It's all about the atmosphere

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
And just

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
You know

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And by which I mean, is there a dude

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Present and is there a girl present?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Atmosphere completed

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Yeah, and then just start kissing

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Did you try to start kissing?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
That's always a good start

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Why do you have to jump right to

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Having sex?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
You have to take your clothes off and kiss

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Nothing makes me hornier than a good

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Conversation

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Which is really awkward when talking

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
To Griffin

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Is it awkward?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Help

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Help

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I need to get my girlfriend back, any advice

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Brothers? This comes from Form Spring

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
How bad was the

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Prank that she pulled on you that you want to get revenge for?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Is that what he means?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Do you want to get back at her for a prank she pulled?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Either that or she was kidnapped

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I think she's been taken by Colombian drug runners

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
At which point, call Kiefer Sunderland

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Yeah, he'll sort that out

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Here's what I would do, I would wait until you know

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
She's going to walk into her room, then you get a bucket

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You fill the bucket with water, then you put the water bucket

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Half on the door jamb

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
And half on the door

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
And then when she opens the door

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
It all tumbles onto her

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
She'll get

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
She'll get moist from the water in the bucket

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
That's what you're saying

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
This works both ways, if she broke up

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
With you, if she pulled a prank on you

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Then you point at her after the water bucket

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Falls on her and you

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Laugh, if she dumped you

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Then you point at her and say

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Well no one will have you now

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm the best you're going to do

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And the best you're going to do, Weddy

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Take a picture of her

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Film it and put it on YouTube and say

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Be a little fool of yourself and then walk away

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
That's going viral

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
I'll see you this evening

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
For dinner, we have dinner at Giovanni's

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
A reservation

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I'll see you there, have you guys seen the bucket ex

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Oh she's so foolish

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
No one would ever date her

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I'd say I guess I just put

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Hooking up with me back on your bucket

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
List and then walk out

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
That's real good, that's a good one

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
That's real good

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
For real though, you don't need her

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
You're too good for her

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
You listen to a great podcast like this

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Unless it's like a

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Justifiable reason that she broke up with you

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Like you need to quit doing

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Speed

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Or pranks

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Listen, it was funny the first time

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
You have done the bucket thing

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
26 times and it is

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Old

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Until you get a tattoo that says I'm the trickster supreme

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I'm not going to stop pulling pranks

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Trickster supreme with an

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
XXX

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I want to hear Griffin's last question but first I want to tell you

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
All the different ways that you can seek help from

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Our show, there is

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Of course an email address

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
M-B-M-B-A-M at gmail.com

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
There's form spring

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It's form spring

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Something

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I think it's like form spring dot me

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
You really need to nail

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Down that web address

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I don't know that one so just go to

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
M-B-M-B-A-M dot com and all these methods

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Are on there, we love seeing

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Retweeted quotes

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
We have a search so we always see those

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Those always bring us a lot of joy

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
If you could grab a friend

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
The next time you listen to the show

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Or burn a CD for them

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
It would be

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Great too, just put a couple Eps on it

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
And say hey listen to this

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
I know you will like this

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Enjoy this

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I'll tell you a campaign I'm going to try and get started

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I was looking at our stats the other day

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Our statistics and almost half of the people

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
That listen to our show download it through the web

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You got to get on that iTunes

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
It's so efficient

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
It's such an efficient way of getting the show

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You just put it in

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And then you hit the subscribe button

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
And then you get it automatically every week

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
It's just waiting there for you

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
And if I might suggest subscribe

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
And then just download it independently

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Seven times

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Just get it as many times as you can

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
But tell a friend

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I was talking with my buddy Slice

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Who was telling me all the different

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Ways he's come up with to share the show

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And I think that's about it

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
And I'm ready

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Travis if you are

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
To hear our last question

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Our one to grow on

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Comes to us from Yahoo Answers user Rick

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Who asks, I just got out of jail

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
When is NWA

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
World Championship Wrestling on?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I'm Justin McElroy

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I'm Travis McElroy

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
And this has been my brother, my brother

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And me

36:13.000 --> 36:23.000
You'll never know me

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Yeah
