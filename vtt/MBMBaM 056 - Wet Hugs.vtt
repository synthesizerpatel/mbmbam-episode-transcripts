WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:49.760
Welcome to the first My Brother, My Brother, and Me direct

00:51.120 --> 01:00.000
from heaven. The Holy of Holies. Post-Rapture, got swept up, what's that, swept away? If you

01:00.000 --> 01:06.080
didn't get left behind, you got swept away. Uh, and now we're here. We're up here and we did it.

01:06.080 --> 01:12.640
We did it. It's super nice. Um, nobody has belly buttons, which is kind of weird. That was a

01:12.640 --> 01:20.800
surprise. Um, and they, they show, uh, to catch a predator reruns all day cause that shows pretty

01:20.800 --> 01:27.120
much always great to always goes down super smooth. There, there is one downside. Tell me.

01:27.120 --> 01:33.760
Griffin got left behind. Griffin did get left behind. Uh, what we have done is made a deal with

01:33.760 --> 01:40.000
the devil that once a week we can go back to earth to record an advice show for the modern era.

01:40.960 --> 01:47.600
Uh, not this week, this week, Jesus let Griffin come up to see what he's missing. Guys, guys. Yeah.

01:47.600 --> 01:53.360
You guys, seriously, me and Kirk Cameron are tight, tight bros now. Yeah. Did he get, wait,

01:53.360 --> 02:00.160
did he get left behind? He did as sort of an envoy. Okay. That's his new, his new role is

02:00.160 --> 02:06.000
Kirk Cameron envoy to the stars. Uh, it's just me and him just fucking rapping about bananas

02:06.000 --> 02:10.240
and how good they are. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is Kirk Cameron in bananas?

02:11.120 --> 02:15.760
He's like super heavy. Never seen that, that clip that YouTube clip. Now he's like,

02:15.760 --> 02:21.040
he talks about bananas and he's like bananas prove that God exists. Um, because there's just

02:21.040 --> 02:27.840
so perfect. It's just so perfect. These bananas could not possibly be some sort of cosmic accident.

02:27.840 --> 02:32.560
And like, I get it Kirk, like they're delicious and they fit right in your hand and they have

02:32.560 --> 02:37.760
a natural shell and they have potassium and shit. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. They're delish.

02:38.400 --> 02:45.600
Um, so, so yeah, it's just me and Kirk now. Wait, so everyone got swept up except you and Kirk

02:45.600 --> 02:51.520
Cameron. Yeah. We are the only two people left on earth. Whoa. Is that weird? Is that awkward for

02:51.520 --> 02:56.400
you? Uh, it was, I'll be honest, it was weird at first and I'll be even more honest. It's still

02:56.400 --> 03:01.920
really weird. Still pretty weird, right? Still like pretty weird all the time. So, um, I miss,

03:01.920 --> 03:08.400
I miss you guys. I miss, I miss everyone who isn't Kirk Cameron at this point. Um, oh wow. So,

03:09.680 --> 03:15.120
so like a lot, there's a lot of people you miss. Is that weird to tell him that?

03:15.120 --> 03:20.720
Fucking nonstop bananas. Like dude, I get it. Talk about something else. Like you were on

03:20.720 --> 03:25.440
growing pains, right? Let's rap about growing pains. Please. Anything but these bananas.

03:25.440 --> 03:30.560
What was it like literally anything else? The video game hoard. Was that fun? Just tell me

03:30.560 --> 03:36.320
anything Kirk. So if Griffin had a question about how to best handle Kirk Cameron, he could turn to

03:36.320 --> 03:39.840
my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

03:39.840 --> 03:45.760
Justin McElroy heaven. I'm your middle, this brother, Travis McElroy. I am your youngest,

03:46.320 --> 03:53.360
uh, he even his brother, I guess. That's true. Evilist heathenist. Well, let's, let's be honest,

03:53.360 --> 04:01.120
Jewish ist of the three of us. I think that that no, that's fair. Yeah. You're the most Jewish,

04:01.120 --> 04:06.640
I think. Which again, another huge point of contention between me and Kirk loves bananas.

04:06.640 --> 04:11.360
Not quite as big a fan of the chosen people. Kirk loves bananas. Griffin loves Elaine Boozler.

04:11.360 --> 04:17.120
I think she's just a hoot. Let's get it right in the questions. My, uh, six month anniversary is

04:17.120 --> 04:23.440
coming up and I don't know what I should do. I've been told everything from just dinner to a movie

04:24.480 --> 04:31.760
to flowers to jewelry. What? What do you guys think is the appropriate thing to do for six

04:31.760 --> 04:37.600
month anniversary? I am 22. My girlfriend is 21. Our anniversary is on Monday the 23rd,

04:38.160 --> 04:41.360
but I'll listen to your show in the morning and won't be seeing her to the evening.

04:41.360 --> 04:45.440
So I will be able to act on your wisdom before I see her. That's from Joe. Joe,

04:45.440 --> 04:52.160
do want to clarify real quick. We do not advise you take any of the advice we give you. There's

04:52.160 --> 04:57.200
a lot of pressure on me. Now this feels like do you skip the first 45 seconds of the show?

04:57.200 --> 05:03.040
Like how do you not know? Don't do our shit. Our shit is bad. The shit is bad. Now this,

05:03.040 --> 05:05.120
what I'm about to say is going to sound like one of those like,

05:05.680 --> 05:10.880
wow, Travis just said really bad advice. Wow. When Travis has to preface his bad advice,

05:10.880 --> 05:14.400
you know it's about to get dirty. I'm almost certain that a six month anniversary,

05:14.400 --> 05:18.960
what you have to do is say, oh hey, happy anniversary. It's been six months, I guess.

05:18.960 --> 05:23.360
I go, you know, I'm going to go with Trav on this one. You do not want to set,

05:23.360 --> 05:30.240
at if anything, the six month anniversary is the appropriate time for an expectations

05:30.240 --> 05:34.960
lowering game. You do not want to start pushing the bar up. Is that just so you can flip it at

05:34.960 --> 05:40.240
the one year when it really counts? Do a dynamite job at the years, but six months?

05:42.000 --> 05:47.600
Just figure out right now what you are going to get her at one year and then cut that thing in

05:47.600 --> 05:54.800
half and give, uh huh. Well cut like, baby, I got you this sweet diamond brooch. Uh,

05:54.800 --> 05:59.200
just kidding. I got you half of a sweet diamond brooch because this doesn't matter what we're

05:59.200 --> 06:05.760
doing or it will, it will in six months. And I do want to thank you for my gift,

06:05.760 --> 06:08.240
crumbed lawn, a broad sword that cuts diamonds.

06:11.280 --> 06:15.200
That was very thoughtful of you. You got me to give me crumbed lawn.

06:15.200 --> 06:21.440
You got me the blessed sky blade and I used it and I cut. This is, this is Rufus. He is your dog,

06:21.440 --> 06:25.120
but this is half of him. You'll get the other half in exactly six months.

06:25.120 --> 06:30.880
If when in doubt, ask your partner, ask like, Hey, so we're going to do something for the six

06:30.880 --> 06:34.880
month anniversary. What would you like to do? Yeah. Get that dialogue going now.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.360
I want to treat you right. How do you want me to treat you?

06:38.960 --> 06:42.480
Come back and be like, I want to do something special or more than likely,

06:42.480 --> 06:45.600
she's going to come back and say, I don't really care.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.320
I hear Burger King has a new sandwich. Let's check it out.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.800
Honestly, man, six months. The victory is going to be that you remembered.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.040
Yeah.

06:53.600 --> 07:00.800
A card, a card. Yeah. I remember this. You impressed the odds were against me.

07:00.800 --> 07:05.040
We're calling this, but I did. I triumphed over the odds. Um, I,

07:06.720 --> 07:10.720
people who listen to this show regularly know that we have, we do have a romantic streak,

07:10.720 --> 07:15.760
but this is the sort of empty sentimentality that I don't think serves anybody any good.

07:15.760 --> 07:21.760
It only is like a stressor for you. And, um, it's false importance.

07:21.760 --> 07:27.040
And, and just to break it down and take it a little bit further anniversary, like the word

07:27.040 --> 07:33.680
means the celebration of a year gone past Anna is a year. So to say what it's a, what it's a

07:33.680 --> 07:43.120
versary, a versary from the old times, a pagan ritual. We fucking did it. It means we fucking

07:43.120 --> 07:49.760
did it in the old days. Like, like a couple of like sports players high-fiving in the changing

07:49.760 --> 07:54.560
room. Oh yeah. Give your girlfriend a nice pat on the bottom and say good game. They said it

07:54.560 --> 07:59.040
couldn't be done. That's a good tone to set for the day. Actually. They said it couldn't be done.

07:59.040 --> 08:03.840
Maybe you should finally tell her that you love her, Joe. You've been holding onto that car for

08:03.840 --> 08:09.840
a while. Joe, play that card. She's ready. Hey, get this next question. This is weird.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.640
I've been dating my boyfriend for almost six months and we don't live together. I know.

08:15.440 --> 08:22.800
It's a crossover. It's a crossover event. Uh, I have it sweeps. So we gotta go big. I have way

08:22.800 --> 08:27.920
more vacation time from work than he does. And that sucks, but I want to be able. Did you like

08:27.920 --> 08:32.640
the, uh, how emphatic I'm reading questions? You really got in there. I'm really bringing it.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.640
And I want to be able to have fun with my time off. Even if he can't be with me,

08:36.640 --> 08:42.080
I love to go backpacking and I'm in a backpacking group. That's not exists. Refuse to believe that

08:42.080 --> 08:46.240
exists. That plans on five or six trips a year. There's an awesome one plan for the end of the

08:46.240 --> 08:52.720
month. But my boyfriend said he can't get the time off from work. He is self described as very jealous

08:52.720 --> 08:57.200
and he doesn't like any of the men he knows who are going on this trip. I want to go. He doesn't

08:57.200 --> 09:01.600
want to go. And we've been fighting about it every day for too long. If you brothers tell me I'm

09:01.600 --> 09:10.720
wrong, I am ready to give in help. Please. Controversial in California. Oh God, this is a

09:10.720 --> 09:15.760
fucking sticky one. Listen, it is. That is exactly right. Cause things are going to get sticky on

09:15.760 --> 09:19.600
that backpack. We know what happened on the backpacking trips. What do you have in that

09:19.600 --> 09:26.480
backpack? Fucking whipped cream. Fucking those like the, the balls that you put in your butt

09:26.480 --> 09:33.280
to make the sex feel better. We know. Why does your backpack say lube bag on it? We know what

09:33.280 --> 09:40.640
you're doing in those deep, dark, stinky woods. We know what you're getting up to. Like don't

09:40.640 --> 09:45.120
play us and don't play your boyfriend on these backpacking trips. When you want to keep bugs

09:45.120 --> 09:50.800
away, you spray on because that's how, that's how on it is. That's how deeply, deeply on

09:50.800 --> 09:58.000
uh, backpacking trips go. It gets sticky in there. It gets so sticky that the, that deep

09:58.000 --> 10:04.480
has pheromones in it that just drives fellas wild. Hey, Hey Phillip, do you need me to help you

10:04.480 --> 10:10.160
put your tent up? Bad news, Shelly. I already popped a tent. Check it down there. You done?

10:10.160 --> 10:16.480
Did I mean my dick? That's what you did to me with your curves and your Berkeys and your Birkin

10:16.480 --> 10:24.800
socks and your sweet khaki shorts. Let me get some of that gorp. I'm starving. I gotta carve

10:24.800 --> 10:35.120
up before I love you. Uh, I, uh, I, oh man. Jealousy is a, is a bad vibe, especially for

10:35.120 --> 10:39.520
somebody you've been with for six months. Like that six months is a really important amount of

10:39.520 --> 10:49.760
time. I mean that, I think that that is, this is like one of those, we've been together six months.

10:49.760 --> 10:56.000
He's got this big problem. How do I sort of step around it? And I honestly think that whether it's,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.160
you know, whether this is your battleground or not, kind of get past that jealousy thing.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.240
Yeah. That's it. Cause what jealousy, like the root of jealousy is always trust. You know what

11:04.240 --> 11:09.520
I mean? Like, yeah. And guys will always say, people always say, it's not that I don't trust

11:09.520 --> 11:14.400
you. It's that I don't trust everyone else. Yeah. It's like, well, you should probably still trust

11:14.400 --> 11:21.360
me. And the root of a tree is a root and you got to get up in nature while it's still here. How much

11:21.360 --> 11:27.840
longer do we have all these trees? Oh, you're saying I read an advantage. I read a science

11:27.840 --> 11:32.560
book the other day and it was like, guys, we got like maybe another five or six years with these

11:32.560 --> 11:38.080
trees and then they're all gone. And then they paved paradise and put up a parking lot, just the

11:38.080 --> 11:42.000
whole planet, just one big parking lot. And then who's going to feel fucking silly. Then you have

11:42.000 --> 11:46.960
to go backpacking through the tree museum. And then it's like, get those people out of here.

11:48.080 --> 11:52.480
You're going to have these giant natural sex orgies and you won't have the shade provided by

11:52.480 --> 11:56.320
mother nature. And everyone's going to get burns on their privates. Everyone's going to get private

11:56.320 --> 12:01.760
burns. So just do it while you still can. God, you're so young. You're so young. Just go love the

12:01.760 --> 12:07.120
world. Just get out there and love Philip. It's a guy you're backpacking with. Have fun. Eat some

12:07.120 --> 12:12.640
gorp. Maybe you have a little sex. Climb a tree. Watch out for mosquitoes. And don't tell him about

12:12.640 --> 12:18.000
what happens. Don't you ever tell him. Just to relieve your guilt that he'll never get over that.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.360
Griffin. Three barn owls watched me have sex in a tree. It was the most spiritual erotic experience

12:23.360 --> 12:29.200
in my life. Do you want to Yahoo? Is that what you were saying my name for? Who is boning so good

12:29.200 --> 12:35.840
down there? Hey, how about this Yahoo? I'm going to go snatch a field mouse out of that man's.

12:35.840 --> 12:40.080
Why does that man have a field mouse down there? This is weird. I'm going to turn that into a

12:40.080 --> 12:45.360
bolus. Why is there a condom in this pellet? Hey science, get over here and look at this pellet.

12:46.400 --> 12:52.160
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by Curly Head Poet. Thank you Curly Head Poet. It's by Yahoo answers

12:52.160 --> 13:00.960
user Kevin B and it's the saddest thing I've ever read. Okay. Kevin B asks what do hugs feel like?

13:04.080 --> 13:10.160
I see people hug in school all the time. What's it like? I've never hugged. I've never hugged

13:10.160 --> 13:14.800
or been hugged by anyone. Can you please describe it in detail? Oh God, no.

13:14.800 --> 13:26.000
Oh Jesus. I'm going to cry. I know. Oh, it got real. It got so real in here. Give me the guy's

13:26.000 --> 13:34.400
name again. Kevin B. Kevin B. Kev. Um, I mean let's break it down. You're not that great Kev.

13:35.440 --> 13:42.960
Yeah, hugs are gross. I wish I had never had a hug on me from a parent or family or a loved one.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.680
It feels like the beginning of a Pixar movie where Kevin B now goes off and invents a robot

13:47.680 --> 13:54.320
to hug him. I just can't. How do you go your whole life avoiding? I hug people. I work from home and

13:54.320 --> 13:59.920
rarely leave my home and I still hug 10 to 12 people every day. Yeah. You know what Kevin,

13:59.920 --> 14:04.000
you got to get out there and start hugging strangers. Is it possible he's like a human

14:04.000 --> 14:09.920
porcupine? Oh, you think he's got porcupitis? Yeah. You guys remember that Dave Matthews

14:09.920 --> 14:15.200
band video every day where you just like go, the guy wakes up and he just walks around the street

14:15.200 --> 14:20.880
hugging people and it's like, lift me up love. And he just goes around hugging people. Uh huh.

14:20.880 --> 14:26.960
You know that music, the music video I'm talking about. Yeah. Is that who that is? Uh huh. All

14:26.960 --> 14:34.240
right. That's wow. Travis, you're like a fucking DMV. DMV scholar over there. Yeah. That's what you

14:34.240 --> 14:39.440
got to do. You got to go get your hands dirty and by hands, I mean arms because hugging is a dirty

14:39.440 --> 14:45.280
thing. Do you know how, you know, Dave Matthews band is weird because pretty much every band

14:46.640 --> 14:53.040
that people like to brag that they were into them before something. I think that Dave Matthews band,

14:53.040 --> 15:00.160
the more impressive thing is to, is to be a fan after. Yeah. I'm still into them. After violin

15:00.160 --> 15:06.720
guy died, I was still there. Like I was still, I was into Dave Matthews band far, far, far after

15:06.720 --> 15:11.680
it was fashionable. Even after he just became Dave Matthews and then realized he still needed his

15:11.680 --> 15:17.440
band. I'm still there. Still there for him. Um, a lot of people heard American baby and were like,

15:17.440 --> 15:23.520
oh, this is the worst goddamn song ever crafted by man. I can never listen to this band again.

15:23.520 --> 15:28.720
A lot of people. Crank it up. I will see you in Charlotte. It was like a Dave Matthews rapture.

15:28.720 --> 15:38.640
Yeah. And I was left behind. Um, hugs, hugs feel like you're wearing another person. Is that a

15:38.640 --> 15:45.280
person jacket? It's like you're wearing another man or woman as a jacket or coat or scarf.

15:46.320 --> 15:51.440
And they protect you. A lot of people say sex is like the closest the two people can be to each

15:51.440 --> 15:59.440
other. I disagree. Cause I think sex is like a wet hug. Sex is like a wet hug. Go on.

16:01.280 --> 16:08.000
You've got me so far. Sex is like a wet hug that you can only do with like one or two people

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
once you marry them. Okay. A hug, a dry hug, if you will, which is the parlance I'm going to use

16:14.000 --> 16:19.200
for the rest of my life. A dry hug. That was a good dry hug we just had. That was a good dry hug.

16:19.200 --> 16:26.400
It could have been moisture, but we don't, we're not at that level yet. Um, I think a dry hug is

16:26.400 --> 16:32.080
the second closest you can be to a person, I think, but you can do it to more people and you won't get

16:32.080 --> 16:39.600
any STDs unless, can you? From a hug? Yeah. A really good dry hug. I don't know if you're at

16:39.600 --> 16:44.960
a Dave Matthews band concert. Absolutely. Certainly. Certainly. You're not coming out of that,

16:44.960 --> 16:50.480
that, uh, dog pile without a few fleas, a few sex fleas, you know, if you know what I mean,

16:50.480 --> 16:56.720
I think you do. Um, as a, as a home brewer, a few times every year, I host a beer party

16:56.720 --> 17:02.320
to share my works with about 10 to 15 friends. I decided trying this with an MB and BAM listening

17:02.320 --> 17:07.600
party could be fun. I would be compelled, however, to make a brothers McElroy ale,

17:07.600 --> 17:14.800
which brings me to my question. What should it be in the BIM BAM brew? What should it be called?

17:14.800 --> 17:22.800
Brian? Hmm. I think my BIM brew. My BIM brew is pretty good. Yeah. My brewski, my brewski and me.

17:23.760 --> 17:30.560
That's good. What about, what about sex gas? Like it gives you that, it gives you like the energy

17:30.560 --> 17:38.560
that you need to make sex. Sex fuel. That seems, I would never say that about beer. I've never,

17:38.560 --> 17:44.560
I've never, I can't think of a single beer I've ever drank where I felt more virile after

17:44.560 --> 17:53.040
consuming the beverage. Um, I would like it if it had notes of coriander. Okay. And blueberries.

17:53.600 --> 17:59.600
Fennel seeds just floating in there. I don't want the flavor of fennel seeds. I want whole fennel seeds.

17:59.600 --> 18:05.520
Whole fennel seeds. You know what? Let's just say, think of all the flavors and notes and hints

18:05.520 --> 18:10.320
you could get into a beer and just put them all in there and call it my brother, my brother and me

18:10.320 --> 18:17.680
flavor explosion. What if, um, what do you. It would be disgusting. Like hands down. What do I like?

18:18.480 --> 18:26.880
I like beer. A crisp pale ale. Um, I also like candy. So, um, what if we threw some Skittles

18:26.880 --> 18:31.040
and Starburst into a pale ale and we called it my brother and my brother and me candy beer?

18:32.560 --> 18:39.200
Candy beer. Candy beer for kids. For the rest of us. Diabeardies. I've always thought of pale ale

18:39.200 --> 18:45.840
to be like a medium through which candy can be delivered. I've just never had the, the,

18:46.400 --> 18:50.720
I don't know, courage, I guess, to mix those two worlds together. Hey Brian, this is pretty good

18:50.720 --> 18:56.800
beer. This, uh, sex fuel that you've made, uh, this MB&B AM sex fuel. Uh, why is there a whole

18:56.800 --> 19:02.080
Werther's original in, in the bottom of this? How do you even do that? Is I'm trying to get drunk,

19:02.080 --> 19:08.080
but there, this, this beer is just full of gummy worms and I don't know how to think. I don't know

19:08.080 --> 19:12.640
how to deal with that. Brian, this is delicious. Are these sugar babies? Cause I didn't even know

19:12.640 --> 19:18.000
they made these anymore. Where did you find sugar babies, Brian? This beer kind of tastes

19:18.000 --> 19:23.840
like Necco wafers and I'm upset about it. Who could I talk to? But I'm getting drunker. I am

19:23.840 --> 19:29.120
drunk. That's good. Isn't this bubble tape? The whole beer is wrapped in bubble tape. That sounds

19:29.120 --> 19:33.760
delicious. There's some, there's a lot of possibilities here. A lot of spaces we could

19:33.760 --> 19:39.600
explore. Actually, it doesn't even have to be the same candy in each beer. Like we, one could,

19:39.600 --> 19:44.080
like you could buy a six pack and in that six pack, oh, this one's got dots and this one's got

19:44.080 --> 19:48.960
a bit of honey and this one has an entire Snickers bar. How did they get that Snickers bar in there?

19:48.960 --> 19:52.000
This is incredible. They must have brewed it in there like the mouse in the Coke bottle.

19:53.760 --> 20:00.640
So Brian, I look forward to drinking your beer. Travis made beer one time. You remember that?

20:00.640 --> 20:04.080
Yes. How would you rate the flavor factor of the beer that you made?

20:04.800 --> 20:11.440
I thought it was just fine. Okay. Did it do the job? It did. I always think that's a satisfying

20:11.440 --> 20:16.960
drunk. The drunk that you made yourself. It's like the little red hen though. Cause no one

20:16.960 --> 20:22.320
would help me brew the beer, but then everyone wanted to help me drink the beer. That's not true

20:22.320 --> 20:28.000
at all. Except no one wanted to drink the beer. Yeah. It's like the little dead hen.

20:30.800 --> 20:37.440
My BF broke up with me six months ago and I was devastated. He moved home. We only talk about once

20:37.440 --> 20:42.480
a month now. He constantly texts me saying I miss you or I've been thinking about you a lot, or

20:43.120 --> 20:48.560
I am still very much in love with you. Oh no, no. She's still very much in love with him

20:48.560 --> 20:55.520
and is confused by the mixed signals. What's the deal? Confused and love. The most bullshit.

20:56.080 --> 21:03.120
He's such a cocksucker. I fucking hate this dude. Insanely. What a bitch. Fuck that guy.

21:03.120 --> 21:09.040
Hey, try this one on for size. Next time he texts you with any of that garbage or anything at all,

21:09.040 --> 21:16.560
I don't care if it's like a mass happy birthday Jesus Christmas text. Tell him to go fuck himself.

21:16.560 --> 21:22.080
Yeah. Go right and fuck himself. Trust me on this one. Burn this fucking bridge. This

21:22.080 --> 21:29.600
cocksucker moved on, said I'm going to find a BBD that of course stands for as developed by Richard

21:29.600 --> 21:37.120
Ginny in the hit film The Mask. A bigger, better deal. He went on for the BBD and he got some other

21:38.080 --> 21:42.880
something that he liked better. Something new. A girl he met at a Dave Matthews band concert.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.640
Hey, before these crowded streets, I want to have sex with you behind the port of John.

21:48.240 --> 21:56.240
And then he moved on. It's hard for you to move on. Next time he texts you, just right away text

21:56.240 --> 22:02.320
back. Go suck a dick. What he's doing is he's either A stringing you along so that when he

22:02.320 --> 22:07.760
comes to visit, he's going to try to sleep with you. No strings attached. Like that movie. No

22:07.760 --> 22:15.360
strings attached. Exactly like the movie. No strings attached. On DirecTV now. Or he's using

22:15.360 --> 22:20.800
you as an outlet for like he's kind of lonely sitting at home and he wants to flirt with

22:20.800 --> 22:25.920
somebody and he thinks you're low hanging fruit and you need to tell him to fuck right off.

22:25.920 --> 22:30.720
You are the highest hanging fruit. You are perched atop the tree like a Christmas star.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.960
You are not in love with him. You may think you are. You're not because he's an asshole.

22:36.400 --> 22:44.800
Listen, he may be just not that into you as they say. Available on DirecTV. Available on DirecTV now.

22:46.960 --> 22:53.920
But you need to get out of this sort of this tete-a-tete. You need to stop being into him

22:53.920 --> 22:58.400
at all. You need not to be. Whatever the opposite of into somebody is, you need to be that.

22:58.400 --> 23:05.120
Do you want me to fight him? Griffin will fight him for your love. That's what we're saying to

23:05.120 --> 23:12.240
you. And it would mean more to me. That's for god damn sure. I need it. I'll fight for it.

23:12.240 --> 23:18.160
Griffin needs to fight somebody for something god damn it. How about a yahoo answer? Yeah.

23:18.160 --> 23:23.520
Um, how about this? Uh, this one was sent in by Gali Ayali. Thank you, Gali Ayali. It's by yahoo

23:23.520 --> 23:30.400
answers user Yeti Education Committee. Do you want to go ahead and imagine what the tone of

23:30.400 --> 23:34.720
this question is going to be? Somebody finally step up and started educating these yetis.

23:36.960 --> 23:44.320
Yahoo answers user Yeti Education Committee asks, do you think it is possible for Yeti

23:44.320 --> 23:48.480
to accept Jesus Christ as their savior or does God not want Yeti in heaven?

23:50.080 --> 23:53.440
Assume the Yeti speaks English, the language of Jesus.

23:55.680 --> 24:02.880
Fuck me. Fuck. Okay. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. This question supposes so many things. First of all,

24:02.880 --> 24:08.160
do people who not speak English, are they just automatically, they just don't get to go to heaven?

24:08.160 --> 24:12.960
Uh huh. Okay. That shouldn't be my main problem with this question, but nope. It's the first thing

24:12.960 --> 24:21.840
that gets sprung to mind. Yetis have souls, I think, but they're like pet souls. Every rock

24:21.840 --> 24:28.240
and tree and creature has a soul. Rocks I'm going to quibble with you on. Okay. And probably trees.

24:28.240 --> 24:35.600
All right. Well trees grow. What kind of trees? Not fir trees. No, fuck fir trees. Deciduous trees.

24:35.600 --> 24:40.560
Deciduous trees have souls. Caniferous? No. No. Are you saying you don't want trees in heaven?

24:40.560 --> 24:44.720
That's what this, that's what this has to boil down to. I don't want deciduous trees in heaven.

24:44.720 --> 24:50.880
God may or may not want Yeti in heaven. I certainly don't. What if like maybe he lets him in heaven,

24:50.880 --> 24:55.200
maybe he doesn't, but he starts spreading a rumor that there's some Yetis up there.

24:55.200 --> 25:00.320
Wouldn't that be a bummer if you got to heaven and again the existence of the Yeti was not confirmed?

25:01.120 --> 25:08.640
It was, it was rumored like can you leave giant paw prints in clouds? All right. If, if my choices

25:08.640 --> 25:16.400
are to be ever tortured by the possibility of Sasquatches. Yeah. Or to have my, to be literally

25:16.400 --> 25:24.160
tortured by having my arms torn off by Sasquatches, which is their favorite activity. Yeah. I would go

25:24.160 --> 25:30.800
with the former every time because I love my arms. I hug with them. If you're Kevin's friend,

25:30.800 --> 25:34.560
of course, that wouldn't, wouldn't matter so much. Wouldn't be quite so big of a deal,

25:34.560 --> 25:39.760
but I'm not, I'm, I don't, I'm not acquainted with Kevin. I like my hugs.

25:41.280 --> 25:48.400
The Sasquatch that is a, is a mythical creature, which means that he comes down from heaven

25:48.400 --> 25:52.800
whenever he's on earth. Like if you see him on earth, that means he's

25:52.800 --> 25:55.040
vacationing basically from heaven. The Yeti is an angel?

25:55.040 --> 26:01.280
Yeah. He's down there spreading the word of God in English, Jesus' language to the penguins.

26:01.280 --> 26:05.040
Do you guys know my favorite episode of Touched by an Angel?

26:06.240 --> 26:10.400
It's the one where the Yeti came down and fucking hung out with that Scottish chick.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.440
Touched by a Yeti.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.480
I like the one where Roba Downey-

26:12.480 --> 26:13.360
Crushed by a Yeti.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.800
I like the one where Roba Downey ripped that dude's arms off.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.600
I'm a Yeti sent by grrrrrrrrrap.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.640
Give me that arm.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.160
Arms ripped off by an angel.

26:25.440 --> 26:30.720
I, uh, I, uh, I think the big surprise for this guy is gonna be when he gets to heaven

26:30.720 --> 26:31.840
and Jesus is a Yeti.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.280
This whole time.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.080
I know you guys were like arguing-

26:36.080 --> 26:37.360
He speaks Arabic.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.440
You guys were arguing like, is he white? Is he Arabic? What's this? Nope, you missed it.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.760
Not even human. I'm a Yeti.

26:43.760 --> 26:44.160
Yeti.

26:45.120 --> 26:50.080
Guess what? The big man, big God, he's a Yeti too. I'm cutting his image.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.000
Pretty much everybody. Loki, he was a Yeti.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.720
He's a Yeti. He's up here making tricks and jokes.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.600
Thor is half Yeti.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.800
Thor is half Yeti. Jim Morrison was a Yeti this whole time.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.520
Full blown Yeti.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.280
Jim Morrison won't be in heaven.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.320
Don't be ridiculous.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.200
Jim Belushi, complete Yeti.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.720
Shaved Yeti.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.440
Getty Lee, his actual name is Yeti Lee.

27:15.440 --> 27:18.080
He's not dead yet, but he is a Yeti.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.920
Yeah, that's where he gets all his base groups from, from his Yeti powers.

27:21.920 --> 27:25.040
Bootsy Collins, most bases and bands are Yetis.

27:25.040 --> 27:30.640
Most people you see on the streets are Yetis, I would say.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.520
Guys, I have something to tell you.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.080
Yeah, tell me.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.600
I'm a Yeti.

27:39.360 --> 27:46.160
That's why I didn't get into heaven, because I'm already like a resident.

27:46.160 --> 27:50.080
We've been saving it for the season finale, and this is the twist.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.440
Shocking reveal of my true nature.

27:53.440 --> 27:58.560
I've got Yeti DNA and skin and like Yeti skin and fur and teeth and stuff.

27:59.920 --> 28:03.360
That person you had the live show didn't look like a Yeti.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.240
It's because it wasn't me.

28:05.680 --> 28:06.000
What?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.360
It was an actor?

28:07.360 --> 28:08.320
It was my familiar.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.760
Every Yeti gets a familiar.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.120
A one human familiar.

28:11.920 --> 28:12.640
So that was mine.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.080
His name is Mike.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.040
He's pretty cool, I guess.

28:18.160 --> 28:22.000
Yeah, that's just something I hope that you will still let me do the show.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.520
Honestly, Griffin, I don't know that I'm comfortable.

28:27.520 --> 28:31.440
I think after the summer, we'll leave this as like a cliffhanger.

28:32.240 --> 28:36.960
To recap, Griffin told us a Yeti, and we may not let him stay on the show.

28:37.520 --> 28:41.680
Bernard, our lovable lab tech, was shot in a hold up, and he's in the alley.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.280
We don't know if he's going to live or die.

28:43.280 --> 28:48.640
He has no arms, but I had nothing to do with that.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.400
Stop trying to pin this on me.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.400
Especially you without arms.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.440
That's impossible.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.560
Could be so Yeti-ist.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.720
Yeti-phobe.

28:56.720 --> 28:57.280
Yeti-phobe.

28:57.280 --> 29:01.600
Griffin, all this talk of Yetis has watered my mouth for money.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.240
Yeah, me too.

29:02.240 --> 29:24.320
Such a happy trip to the Money Zone this week.

29:24.320 --> 29:28.960
First off is our buddy Michael McLaughlin, who wants to congratulate his friends

29:28.960 --> 29:32.160
Jenny and Zach on their recent wedding.

29:32.160 --> 29:36.720
Travis, tell me about Zach and Jenny Murphy.

29:36.720 --> 29:40.480
Well, they've been together for six years, beginning of their sophomore year in high

29:40.480 --> 29:40.880
school.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.200
Wow, high school sweethearts.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.000
Love it.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.040
They said it wouldn't last, and look at them killing it.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.120
They have a beautiful child named Kennedy.

29:49.680 --> 29:55.440
Have they been together for six years, or have they been together for 12 six-month periods?

29:55.440 --> 29:58.720
It's something to think about.

29:59.840 --> 30:04.560
Jenny is a big fan of podcasts, especially our podcast.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.600
Zach, not a fan.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.200
He's not enjoying our show.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.160
Door's that way.

30:10.160 --> 30:14.880
Hey, Zach, don't let it hit you where Yeti God split you.

30:17.760 --> 30:18.960
He will tear you in half.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.880
By that, I do mean tear your arms off, yes.

30:20.880 --> 30:26.000
All right, so we got some good vibes going on to you guys from Mike, Courtney, and Kyle.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.320
That's Courtney with a K in case you know Courtney with a C.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.120
And Kyle with a C.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.960
And Kyle with a C.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.840
And Jenny with an I.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.200
Mike with an R.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.120
Zach with a T.

30:36.320 --> 30:40.320
They wish them all the best and many happy years.

30:40.320 --> 30:47.120
How many, can we make that less, can we just clear that up like exactly how many years?

30:47.120 --> 30:51.600
For $100, they get 20 happy years.

30:51.600 --> 30:51.920
Whoa.

30:52.560 --> 31:03.040
If he had paid a little bit more, we can guarantee you up to 25, 26 to 27 years tops.

31:03.040 --> 31:07.040
Enjoy the next two decades because it's all downhill after that.

31:07.040 --> 31:10.640
Well, then they can re-up and pay another $100 for another 20 years.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.200
I can't guarantee the same rates, but yeah, they can re-up.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.480
Oh no, by that point.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.840
With inflation and whatnot, it will be like a thousand Mars dollars.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.080
And the popularization of space credits, sure.

31:20.080 --> 31:20.580
Yeah.

31:21.760 --> 31:26.080
Also another one, Ryan Math wants to congratulate his girlfriend Kat Crosslin

31:26.080 --> 31:28.640
on getting admitted to the NYU nursing program.

31:28.640 --> 31:28.960
Nice.

31:28.960 --> 31:29.840
Hey, congrats.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.720
Way to go, Kat.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.600
She's currently living like a bum without a job in Brooklyn.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.400
I say like a boss without a job in Brooklyn

31:38.400 --> 31:43.840
till she starts nursing school in September while the rest of us slave away in the heat.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.440
So Kat, that's exciting.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.360
We're proud of you.

31:47.360 --> 31:48.320
I'm proud of you.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.280
I'm proud of you too.

31:49.280 --> 31:51.360
I'm not proud that you don't have a job.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.560
What's up with that?

31:52.560 --> 31:55.840
Just because you're in school, you think you're too good for employment?

31:56.880 --> 32:01.520
I will emphatically say that I do not respect your choice to not be employed,

32:01.520 --> 32:06.960
but it sounds like Ryan's able to pay to have us take congratulations.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.480
So he's obviously rolling in it.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.760
Could I suggest as a job freelance nursing?

32:11.760 --> 32:13.440
That's illegal, I'm pretty sure.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.640
Oh, so like he gets, she gets like an early start before she knows anything.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.680
Yeah, so she just starts rolling around and like she sees someone fall down,

32:19.680 --> 32:20.720
she slaps a bandage on him.

32:20.720 --> 32:21.920
She's like, that'll be 10 bucks.

32:22.480 --> 32:28.400
Well, listen, from what I know about nursing, it's a lot of disimpacting bowels,

32:28.400 --> 32:30.480
which I'm not sure you want to do to a stranger.

32:31.040 --> 32:36.160
There's a lot of touching dick, like shaving dick, like a lot of shaving dicks.

32:36.160 --> 32:40.000
Like Kat, I don't mean to burst your bubble, but this is a life that you have subscribed to.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.120
Um, and maybe you don't want to do that to strangers on the street.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.840
Uh, I'll, I'll shave a stranger's balls.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.680
Maybe she could have me come in as a sub, as a substitute.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.360
Like tag team those balls.

32:51.360 --> 32:54.480
Now, Justin, were you going to finish that sentence with for money?

32:54.480 --> 32:57.440
Are you just saying like in general, you're out of money?

32:57.440 --> 32:59.680
Yeah, that's what I, that's what I meant.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.480
It would have to be for money.

33:01.040 --> 33:01.920
Sure, for money.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.840
I wouldn't, I wouldn't shave a man's scrotum for free.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.280
Well, it depends on the man, right?

33:07.280 --> 33:10.880
Like, um, what if it's George Lucas?

33:10.880 --> 33:14.960
I wouldn't mind hanging out with him for like a minute or however long.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.880
Well, it depends on what the minute is.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.320
Like for that minute, I think I would mind it pretty bad.

33:20.320 --> 33:25.520
You can't think of it like a person you want to hang out with so much that like you wouldn't

33:25.520 --> 33:30.320
want to hang out with Elvis Costello so much that you wouldn't mind that during that minute

33:30.320 --> 33:31.680
you'd be shaving his balls.

33:31.680 --> 33:35.840
There's not a human being on this God's green light.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.760
On God's green earth.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.440
On all of history.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.240
On all of history?

33:42.240 --> 33:47.040
There's not a single person in history whose balls I would shave to hang out with.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.160
Thomas Jefferson.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.840
You wouldn't shave his balls so you can hang out with the father of America.

33:52.400 --> 33:52.640
No.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.400
George Washington.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.600
He had slave wives for that.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.320
Amadeus.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.920
Amadeus, he was hairless.

33:59.920 --> 34:06.960
Nikolai Tesla. Tesla fried all his ball sack hair off in a failed experiment and he looked

34:06.960 --> 34:07.840
like David Bowie.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.040
I'm going to reject the person question.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.400
David Bowie.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.280
David Bowie?

34:12.160 --> 34:14.640
Cosplaying as Nikola Tesla maybe.

34:14.640 --> 34:18.400
In the hit film Prestige.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.360
Prestiginist.

34:21.920 --> 34:25.280
That's all I could- those are the best people that I just named that have ever happened

34:25.280 --> 34:25.680
to us.

34:25.680 --> 34:26.080
Yeah.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.680
Why don't you give me a quick list there?

34:27.680 --> 34:29.200
Where- where'd he?

34:30.160 --> 34:31.760
Your future child all grown up.

34:32.720 --> 34:32.960
Think-

34:32.960 --> 34:33.680
Oh God.

34:33.680 --> 34:34.400
Think about that.

34:35.520 --> 34:41.440
You're saying- you're saying to get to see him, this future theoretical baby, as an older

34:41.440 --> 34:41.600
adult.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.760
Well he's grown up, he's an adult.

34:43.760 --> 34:44.480
He's all grown up.

34:44.480 --> 34:52.080
Like see- okay, if I could see all- if I could see all of my ancestors, like through history,

34:52.080 --> 34:58.000
like the ones that would come after me, if I could see you down that particular future

34:58.000 --> 35:03.280
well, like seven, eight, nine, ten generations down, I would shave each of their balls to

35:03.280 --> 35:06.080
get to meet that, because I think that would be pretty special.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.200
I found it!

35:07.200 --> 35:09.440
I knew I could find it if I went long enough.

35:09.440 --> 35:13.440
You could get a sports almanac from one of them, where you get all kinds of sweet facts

35:13.440 --> 35:15.840
and it'd be like, what's the secret to your success?

35:15.840 --> 35:18.000
And it's like, oh I shaved my grandson's balls.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
I shaved my great-great-great-grandson's balls.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.440
So congratulations, Kat.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.960
Oh, this is gonna be a fun jingle.

35:30.960 --> 35:35.200
Yeah, yeah, well I almost moved on without the jingle that they paid for.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.000
Oh Christ.

35:36.000 --> 35:47.440
I forgot that we do these, because I haven't done it in a while.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.440
Nope.

35:49.440 --> 35:49.440
Nope?

35:49.440 --> 35:56.160
Something old and something new And something borrowed, something blue

35:56.160 --> 36:04.320
And something shaved and shorn and shiny Yeah, the first thing is about Zach and Ginny

36:04.320 --> 36:08.880
They got married yesterday And the other thing is about

36:08.880 --> 36:14.800
Justin and Kat Crosland They formed a crime-fighting team

36:15.440 --> 36:22.560
Shaving grandson balls They are the worst crime fighters

36:22.560 --> 36:26.720
That I've ever seen They don't fight crime

36:26.720 --> 36:36.160
They fight hair on balls Happy wedding

36:41.520 --> 36:47.600
I edited that one on a minor chord to show how very displeased I was with that jingle.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.640
That was the worst jingle I've done so far, and I'm sorry that you paid for it.

36:50.640 --> 36:56.240
Well, it beats shaving your great-great-grandnephew's balls, that's for sure.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.440
I think it's time for Yahoo Answers.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.080
Yeah, I think so too.

37:01.040 --> 37:04.240
Okay, this one was sent in by Question Mark.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.040
Thank you, Question Mark.

37:05.040 --> 37:08.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bill Steven, who asks,

37:09.440 --> 37:11.760
How can I touch my girlfriend in class?

37:13.200 --> 37:18.640
Me and my girlfriend want to touch each other, just squeeze her ass or squeeze her boobs,

37:18.640 --> 37:21.840
but we can't hang out after school because she's grounded.

37:21.840 --> 37:26.400
We only have one class together and we sit in the back and I need to know how I can do

37:26.400 --> 37:30.000
that kind of stuff without anyone like other kids or the teacher seeing us.

37:30.000 --> 37:30.560
Help, please.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.080
So, like, they're like,

37:34.080 --> 37:39.040
Hey, Jennifer, can I come by after school and maybe just squeeze your boobs?

37:39.040 --> 37:44.320
Oh, Alyssa, Alyssa, I am going to squeeze your boobs all night long.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.800
Hey, this is a text from me.

37:46.800 --> 37:50.320
I just wanted you to start thinking about how I'm going to squeeze your boobs tonight.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.280
There is nothing more romantic than just, like,

37:53.280 --> 37:57.680
a vicious, unending groping of someone's bottom and or breasts.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.040
I can- I will latch onto that boob, that left boob,

38:01.040 --> 38:04.960
and I will just hang on it all night like a three-toed slob.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.480
It's going to feel so great, Jen.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.560
I hope you don't have to run to the convenience store for anything last minute,

38:12.560 --> 38:14.800
because once Griffin's on there, he is not coming off.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.760
Are we done?

38:15.760 --> 38:17.920
Are we- are we- because I'm latched.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.200
You are done moving.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.720
I bought these special gloves.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.000
It's like putting on sweatpants.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.800
Once you're in, you're in for the night,

38:26.800 --> 38:30.880
so get comfortable with the fact that he is going to be groping your boob that hard.

38:30.880 --> 38:37.600
I've got a- I've got a dry hug that I do that involves squeezing a boob for hours.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.840
I'm like the sting of boob squeezes.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.480
Also, really sorry about the bruises.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.320
No, that's the thing.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.480
I might- I'm so good at it that I don't-

38:47.280 --> 38:48.240
Like a tantric hug?

38:48.240 --> 38:49.440
I don't leave any evidence.

38:49.440 --> 38:50.880
Now, as far as the question asker,

38:50.880 --> 38:52.640
if you want to do this kind of stuff in school,

38:53.840 --> 38:56.800
first- the first thing you gotta do is take a bullshit class.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.400
Cooking would work.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.080
Acting.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.400
That- if you have a theater class, oh, forget about it.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.600
That's where the gropes are happening.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.760
Are they by the most attractive people?

39:05.760 --> 39:07.520
Nah, you know, probably not.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.160
There are people on, like, berets and-

39:10.160 --> 39:14.480
Does your school offer a, um, like a mammogram training seminar?

39:14.480 --> 39:17.600
Because that would be- that would be very on the nose.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.480
Also, you could consider a big blanket.

39:21.440 --> 39:25.520
There are- there are- there are laws that prohibit a school from-

39:25.520 --> 39:27.120
because of religious reasons-

39:27.120 --> 39:30.000
that prohibit a school from looking underneath a big blanket.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.320
And then maybe your math teacher is going to be very confused

39:34.320 --> 39:37.760
as to why you've spread a big blanket over two desks in the back row.

39:37.760 --> 39:41.120
So you just tell him, I'm a blanketarian, and I don't like the persecution

39:41.120 --> 39:42.000
that you're putting me through.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.640
I'm going to bring a civil- a civil trial against you.

39:46.640 --> 39:51.040
I am quiltish, and I don't actually appreciate this hate that I'm getting from you.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.440
Why are you so anti-Snuggie, is what I want to know.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.640
You know what's going to be embarrassing, though?

39:54.640 --> 39:58.160
When there is a quiltist, like, a real one right next to him,

39:58.160 --> 39:59.760
they'll have to look at him with that judgment.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.920
Aren't Quakers- aren't Quakers quiltists?

40:01.920 --> 40:02.640
Isn't that a thing?

40:02.640 --> 40:03.140
Mm-hmm.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.040
Don't- isn't that one of their beliefs?

40:05.040 --> 40:06.960
God damn it, you guys, I miss high school.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.720
Do you remember when the biggest concern in your life

40:08.720 --> 40:10.160
was that you wanted to squeeze a boob?

40:10.160 --> 40:13.440
And you were like, oh, how do I- there aren't enough hours in the day.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.400
I gotta- I gotta come up with some sort of heist

40:16.400 --> 40:18.160
so that I can squeeze boob through school because that's all I think about.

40:18.160 --> 40:20.400
You're standing there looking at your- the schedule and your trapper keeper,

40:20.400 --> 40:24.400
and you're like, well, I got math at 11, and then I have band at 12.30.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.480
When am I supposed to squeeze in squeezins?

40:26.480 --> 40:30.800
If I eat my lunch really quickly, maybe we can go out into the commons

40:30.800 --> 40:33.760
and hide behind a tree, and I can squeeze a fucking boob.

40:33.760 --> 40:38.800
Do you remember the feeling of it being three o'clock in the afternoon?

40:38.800 --> 40:39.120
Yeah.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.760
And you are done with your day?

40:41.760 --> 40:43.760
Like, you don't have fuck all else to do.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.400
Yep.

40:44.400 --> 40:44.640
Yeah.

40:45.280 --> 40:48.880
Being an adult is like, be at school all the time forever.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.360
Like, you're never not at school when you're an adult.

40:51.360 --> 40:57.760
But I have to say, my- my boob squeezing career improved drastically

40:57.760 --> 40:59.040
after I got out of school.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.960
So I guess that there's a trade-off is what I'm saying.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.640
It's like school that you can never get out of,

41:02.640 --> 41:04.320
but there's so many more boobs to squeeze.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.840
Uh, I- I- I- I'm in a bit of a pickle.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.760
I- see, a lot of- a lot of emotion this week I'm bringing.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.260
Mm-hmm.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.640
Uh, I have to plan a bachelorette party, but here's the kicker.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.560
We can't have booze.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.920
The other bridesmaids don't drink for religious reasons.

41:21.920 --> 41:26.160
Sorry, Padre, I stopped drinking for religious reasons.

41:26.160 --> 41:29.520
Can- I don't care how much you offer me this vino.

41:29.520 --> 41:34.880
Uh, the only reason I drink is to party, to get down.

41:34.880 --> 41:38.160
No religious- no religious drinking for me.

41:38.880 --> 41:45.920
Now I have to come up with something sassy and fun that doesn't involve drinking.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.720
I got it.

41:46.720 --> 41:51.520
And I'm betting that penis paraphernalia, uh, will be frowned upon as well.

41:51.520 --> 41:56.480
That's from bum-fuzzled bridesmaid in Nashville.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.040
Cashville.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.840
You know what's always fun with parties?

41:59.840 --> 42:04.320
Yeah, like to do a theme party and your theme could be worst party ever.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.040
Yeah, bad.

42:05.040 --> 42:05.760
What's your theme?

42:05.760 --> 42:07.120
It's bad is my theme.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.120
The theme is boring.

42:09.680 --> 42:10.800
We do boring things.

42:10.800 --> 42:13.440
Like you're gonna have a party without drinks or dicks?

42:14.320 --> 42:16.160
No dick paraphernalia?

42:16.160 --> 42:17.280
What's the point?

42:17.280 --> 42:18.320
I want to know.

42:18.320 --> 42:24.480
It sounds like the- the problem is I feel like the premise of a bachelor slash bachelorette

42:24.480 --> 42:31.200
party is one last time to cut loose and be stupid and like, let's do something that you're

42:31.200 --> 42:33.600
not going to be able to do once you're married.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.000
So we're going to go, you know, say it's a bachelor party.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.360
You're going to go drink all day with the boys and play miniature golf.

42:39.360 --> 42:47.600
But to say I need a really chill party that fits into the bounds of religious specifications

42:47.600 --> 42:49.200
is like, well, then don't have the party.

42:49.200 --> 42:54.960
What is- what is her- what is her, like, the way that she cuts loose that she won't be

42:54.960 --> 42:56.800
able to anymore after she gets married?

42:56.800 --> 42:58.160
Maybe you kind of focus on that.

42:58.160 --> 43:03.680
Like maybe you get all the girls together and watch a marathon of NCIS LA and talk about

43:03.680 --> 43:04.960
how hunky Chris O'Donnell is.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.280
Oh my gosh.

43:05.280 --> 43:08.720
I think of that time Chris O'Donnell takes his shirt off, you take a bite of a cookie.

43:09.680 --> 43:10.080
Yeah.

43:10.080 --> 43:10.800
Not a dick shaped cookie.

43:10.800 --> 43:11.520
With no nuts.

43:12.960 --> 43:17.520
You have one time in your life, one time, where you're allowed to eat dick shaped foods

43:17.520 --> 43:20.000
and it's during your bachelorette party because it's fun.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.560
It's fun and it's funny.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.160
Why would you give that up?

43:24.160 --> 43:25.280
You don't get to do it again.

43:26.800 --> 43:27.680
I just don't get it.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.280
You know what you should do, though?

43:30.000 --> 43:30.400
Tell me.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.080
You just squeeze each other's boobs all the time.

43:33.600 --> 43:34.800
That's a good feeling.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.640
That's okay, right?

43:36.640 --> 43:38.400
I guess that's permissible.

43:39.120 --> 43:41.040
I'm saying dry hugs all around.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.280
Dry hugs with boob latching.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.880
With optional boob latching.

43:44.880 --> 43:48.240
You know, there'll be so many girls latched onto boobs, it's gonna look like somebody's

43:48.240 --> 43:50.320
playing barrel of monkeys in there.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.600
Like you just can't even start to separate this tangle.

43:53.600 --> 43:54.800
Exacto mundo.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.920
I just recently discovered that I am gay.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.920
I couldn't be happier.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.680
Well, that's the definition of it, isn't it?

44:04.000 --> 44:09.920
However, I had been going out with a girl for a few weeks before my discovery and now

44:09.920 --> 44:11.600
I need to end it between us.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.120
How could I break up this relationship while keeping her as a friend?

44:15.120 --> 44:15.760
Oh, no.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.960
Mitch, Mitch, I can't stress this enough.

44:21.680 --> 44:24.480
You need to just flat out break up with her.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.960
Do not mention the gay thing.

44:26.960 --> 44:29.920
She can never know, ever.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.640
Although she probably kind of does a little bit.

44:32.640 --> 44:33.920
Probably knows.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.120
She probably knows.

44:35.120 --> 44:37.440
But you can break up with her for any reason.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.240
I would rather you break up with her because she's really fat.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.720
Even if she's not fat, she's like, I'm breaking up with you because you're fat.

44:42.720 --> 44:48.160
Then tell her you are breaking up with her because while with her, you realize that you

44:48.160 --> 44:51.280
want to be with someone who's the complete opposite of her.

44:51.280 --> 44:54.480
Physically, biologically, the complete opposite.

44:54.480 --> 44:57.200
Hormonally, like this is the opposite of you.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.760
I get what you're laying down.

45:00.480 --> 45:02.320
I want not that, basically.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.080
I want the reverse of that.

45:04.080 --> 45:09.600
Maybe you can, maybe the best way to end this is for her to mix the disappointment of the

45:09.600 --> 45:15.120
relationship ending with the satisfaction of knowing all along that you were gay.

45:15.120 --> 45:18.160
Like maybe you walk up to her and just be like, hey, you got me.

45:18.960 --> 45:19.680
Catch you later.

45:20.880 --> 45:21.920
And you guys are done here.

45:22.400 --> 45:27.200
God damn, this must, I'm trying to piece together a timeline of Mitch's discovery.

45:27.200 --> 45:27.760
Okay.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.920
He's been dating this girl for a few weeks.

45:29.920 --> 45:36.000
A few weeks, how did, was it, it's like flipping a switch, right?

45:36.000 --> 45:41.280
Like a few weeks ago, you were like, toad straight, gonna, me and Jennifer are gonna

45:41.280 --> 45:42.720
be together, full Fs.

45:43.680 --> 45:48.240
And then at some point in the past few weeks, that just seems like an awfully long amount

45:48.240 --> 45:51.840
of time or a short amount of time to just be like, gay now.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.760
I'm pretty much gay now.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.040
I'm pretty much, I like guys now.

45:55.040 --> 46:01.920
She was, she was probably, part of an extensive, maybe sort of like a denial type thing.

46:02.880 --> 46:07.360
You're my like, she was, he was trying to convince himself, trying a little something

46:07.360 --> 46:13.200
of everything, you know, like a little trying anything to sort of keep, keep that part of

46:13.200 --> 46:15.840
himself sort of quarantine busted loose.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.920
It's like your first plate at golden corral.

46:18.560 --> 46:22.880
You get, you get a little bit of steak and you get a little bit of fried chicken and

46:22.880 --> 46:27.040
you get a little bit of pasta, a little bit of potato salad, and then you try them all.

46:27.600 --> 46:31.360
And your second plate, you know that you're supposed to focus on fried chicken.

46:31.360 --> 46:32.880
And your second plate, you get dick.

46:32.880 --> 46:36.240
And the second plate, you get, oh, just a buffet of dicks.

46:37.520 --> 46:38.800
This is a special thing.

46:38.800 --> 46:39.440
And this is good.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.240
This is great.

46:40.240 --> 46:42.640
And we're all very proud of you.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.240
She won't be, though.

46:44.880 --> 46:46.800
She's not proud talking in general.

46:46.800 --> 46:48.480
I mean, in this one specific conversation.

46:48.480 --> 46:52.480
All Charles is saying is, in this conversation, he is embarrassed to be gay.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.160
This is the one where it's okay.

46:54.160 --> 46:58.240
Do not expect any high fives is what we're saying from this particular woman.

46:58.240 --> 47:02.480
But on the upside, honey, I'm really happy.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.800
So I'm like the happiest I've ever been.

47:05.760 --> 47:10.400
I wish maybe things would have been different if you could have made me feel this happy.

47:10.400 --> 47:13.120
But we are beyond that point in the conversation.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.920
And now I I'm I'm gay now.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.840
Hey, listen, if I'll cheer you up, maybe you're in bed.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.440
I'll introduce you to Tim Gunn.

47:21.440 --> 47:22.400
How would that be?

47:22.400 --> 47:23.120
Wait, what?

47:23.120 --> 47:24.080
Hold on.

47:24.080 --> 47:27.600
Because we've already established that this has been a sudden, immediate thing.

47:27.600 --> 47:28.880
Like a switch flipping.

47:28.880 --> 47:32.480
You're saying that as soon as that switch gets flipped, Tim Gunn.

47:32.480 --> 47:36.400
In your email the next day, welcome aboard.

47:36.400 --> 47:40.960
When you join MySpace and Tom is immediately your friend.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.440
That's exactly what it's like.

47:43.440 --> 47:46.480
Like when you turn 100 and the president sends you a letter.

47:46.480 --> 47:47.920
Yeah, sort of like that.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.120
And some smuckers.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.000
Is that right?

47:50.000 --> 47:50.720
Yes.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.760
Is that what the president does?

47:51.760 --> 47:52.000
Yeah.

47:53.040 --> 47:59.280
So so I think that he'll really I think that that'll help to turn turn that frown upside down.

47:59.280 --> 47:59.920
And you know what?

47:59.920 --> 48:05.680
She's everybody remembers the guy they were with when he discovered he was gay and he didn't want

48:05.680 --> 48:06.400
to be with you.

48:06.400 --> 48:10.640
You got to make sure that you're the first and only person this ever happens to.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.000
That's the important thing.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.760
It can happen once and it's funny.

48:13.760 --> 48:17.840
If it happens more than once, it's a it's abysmally devastating to her.

48:17.840 --> 48:22.640
What you've got to do is make sure she doesn't date any more secret gay dudes because because

48:22.640 --> 48:23.600
then it would be bad.

48:23.600 --> 48:27.840
You've got to be like Batman for her, except you're protecting her from secret homosexuals.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.000
So you have to be her.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.520
Although I do think Frank Gorshin was a secret homosexual for what it's worth.

48:33.520 --> 48:36.080
You have to be her dark super gay knight.

48:36.720 --> 48:42.320
Yeah, protecting the city by it by wearing leather, wearing leather.

48:42.320 --> 48:46.240
And are you saying like you should like blow a dude in front of her?

48:46.240 --> 48:47.760
Like, never forget this.

48:48.560 --> 48:49.840
Keep this in your mind forever.

48:49.840 --> 48:50.880
Remember this feeling.

48:51.840 --> 48:56.720
If you see her talking to a guy who is secretly gay, you need to stand next to her and just

48:56.720 --> 49:01.680
kind of shake your tush a little bit like a distraction.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.480
Look at how you look at.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.520
He likes this.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.040
I bet he likes this.

49:07.040 --> 49:09.040
You don't want to have anything to do with this guy.

49:09.040 --> 49:09.920
Where's Falcone?

49:11.200 --> 49:12.000
I'm gonna fuck him.

49:13.040 --> 49:13.760
Don't forget this.

49:13.760 --> 49:16.640
Remember this feeling.

49:18.160 --> 49:19.600
Remember this pain.

49:19.600 --> 49:20.160
Pray to me.

49:21.920 --> 49:25.200
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first super quick.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.600
We have we neglected to do this last week, and we have to say this week.

49:29.600 --> 49:33.760
Patrick and Jimison both got MBMBAM tattoos.

49:33.760 --> 49:37.280
One of them got at MBMBAM, one of them got hashtag MBMBAM.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.240
Here's the fun thing about this.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.080
Jimison, professional tattooer.

49:40.800 --> 49:41.120
Yeah.

49:41.120 --> 49:46.080
Patrick, never a tattooer, nary a tattoo applied to a human body.

49:46.080 --> 49:46.640
Has he done?

49:50.240 --> 49:51.440
It's unthinkable.

49:51.440 --> 49:53.360
This whole this whole setup.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.480
The whole setup is bad.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.760
But I'm proud of them, and I'm grateful.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.200
I'm very grateful for it.

49:59.200 --> 49:59.600
Certainly.

50:00.480 --> 50:03.520
They joined the tattoo club, MBMBAM club of three.

50:04.640 --> 50:09.120
Which if you want to join that club, I really ask you to just sit down for a second.

50:09.920 --> 50:10.880
Talk to a loved one.

50:10.880 --> 50:17.200
Maybe take a look in that deep, dark, truthful mirror and really consider the possibilities

50:17.200 --> 50:17.440
here.

50:17.440 --> 50:20.240
But if you go for it, we're happy.

50:20.240 --> 50:21.040
God bless.

50:21.040 --> 50:22.160
Immediately let us know.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.240
Yeah, do send us pictures.

50:25.760 --> 50:30.560
Just a reminder, June 12th, we are sold out for our Cincinnati show.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.800
Tickets sold so briskly.

50:32.800 --> 50:35.760
I think we pretty much have got to do one again soon.

50:35.760 --> 50:42.560
But yeah, and not that I'm encouraging this, but there is going to be a waiting list day

50:42.560 --> 50:45.280
of in case people don't show up.

50:45.280 --> 50:50.000
So if you're in the area, I wouldn't recommend driving like eight hours hoping to get in.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.280
But if you're in the area and you didn't get a chance to get a ticket,

50:53.280 --> 50:57.280
feel free to stop by the theater and check and see if maybe there's some seats available.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.240
Should we talk about our opener?

50:58.240 --> 50:59.200
We got an opener for the show.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:00.320 --> 51:01.680
Dizzy Gillespie.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.360
Dizzy Gillespie is coming back for the dead.

51:03.360 --> 51:06.160
Uh, no, you're close though.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.600
You're not too far off.

51:07.600 --> 51:08.560
Felicia Gillespie.

51:08.560 --> 51:11.200
Oh, yeah, I mixed them up.

51:11.200 --> 51:11.920
She mixed them up.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.440
She's a stand up comedian, super funny.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.600
Uh, we, we reached out to her and she was, she was into it.

51:17.600 --> 51:18.800
She's going to be there.

51:18.800 --> 51:23.040
Um, going to do some comedy before we do some jokes.

51:23.040 --> 51:26.880
Do us a favor and we'll remind you there, but like buy our CDs or something.

51:26.880 --> 51:29.520
Like tell her that she did a great job and buy our stuff.

51:29.520 --> 51:33.920
I don't think I do not think that they are going to need us to tell them to do that.

51:33.920 --> 51:34.880
And we're going to do that.

51:34.880 --> 51:36.320
She's so fucking funny.

51:36.320 --> 51:39.120
We, we were, I can't like, I am no lie.

51:39.680 --> 51:44.880
We, when the three of us were all together in Ohio, we sat down and instantly like,

51:44.880 --> 51:45.840
we're like, yeah, she's great.

51:45.840 --> 51:46.320
Yeah.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.880
We were watching her clips and they were, she's hysterical.

51:48.880 --> 51:49.520
So look her up.

51:49.520 --> 51:52.560
She's going to be opening for us and we couldn't be happier about it.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.120
We're stoked.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.440
Um, uh, real quick.

51:55.440 --> 52:03.200
NBNBAM app experience, uh, if you search on iTunes or droid store for NBNBAM,

52:03.200 --> 52:04.160
you'll find our app.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.240
It's, you can stream all of our episodes.

52:06.240 --> 52:11.120
Um, you can ask us a question directly from the app, uh, that we have extras on there.

52:11.120 --> 52:13.600
Occasionally we'll put in like a deleted bit or something.

52:14.480 --> 52:15.200
What's on there right now?

52:15.200 --> 52:17.280
I never wondered what a Pgasm was.

52:17.280 --> 52:17.520
Pgasm.

52:17.520 --> 52:18.320
Is that what's on there right now?

52:18.320 --> 52:18.720
The Pgasm?

52:18.720 --> 52:20.720
That was our latest, uh, goof.

52:20.720 --> 52:24.800
I, uh, I want to wish a happy birthday to close personal friend of the show, Kristen

52:24.800 --> 52:25.600
Hott.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.960
Uh, so happy birthday.

52:28.960 --> 52:32.320
Actually it's Travis wrote happy birth dat, which is that.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.080
So run tell dat, happy birthday.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.480
Is that run tell dat birthday that you just had.

52:36.480 --> 52:38.080
I hope it was happy, Kristen Hott.

52:38.640 --> 52:43.600
Uh, and that's, oh, uh, oh, we got a new t-shirt design coming.
