00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.800
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the

00:46.800 --> 00:51.280
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.520
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.520 --> 01:03.680
Once upon a time, I was one of the co-hosts of the Joystick podcast and we got to episode 99

01:03.680 --> 01:10.320
and realized that the week following would be our 100th episode. And we didn't have it in us

01:10.320 --> 01:16.960
or weren't able to be prepared enough, maybe is another way of putting it, to actually get it

01:16.960 --> 01:30.160
together to do something special for a 100th episode. So we released episode 98, episode 98a,

01:31.200 --> 01:44.480
episode 98b, episode 98c, episode 99, 99.5, 99.75, 99a, and then episode 100.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.640
Okay. So we did that this one time. I don't

01:48.640 --> 01:54.640
know why I'm relating that anecdote right now, but welcome to episode 421 of my brother,

01:54.640 --> 02:01.280
my brother and me. We're so happy you've joined us here for just the regular amount of weed

02:01.280 --> 02:06.640
discussion episodes of our podcast. Standard amounts.

02:06.640 --> 02:11.360
Keeping it right between the navigational beacons. This is how much reglier people

02:11.360 --> 02:16.560
like ourselves talk about weed. Not too much, not too little.

02:16.560 --> 02:21.520
Just sort of the one thing. I think the one thing this episode,

02:21.520 --> 02:26.400
Willie Nelson's roll me up and smoke me when I die. Does it count as a living will? Discuss.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.040
Are there going to be people when Willie Nelson passes away from this earth? And holy shit,

02:31.040 --> 02:34.800
we can't really talk about celebrities in this context anymore. We've been doing this show for

02:34.800 --> 02:40.720
eight years and it's broken bad on us so many times. Love Willie, keep it up. But when he does

02:40.720 --> 02:45.520
pass on, is there going to be somebody who's like, all right, here's a big, big rolling paper.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.200
Somebody's going to be like, hey, hold on, this is a dude. And they're like, no,

02:50.160 --> 02:56.400
he was very, he was explicitly clear. I don't want to do this either. I don't want you to

02:56.400 --> 03:00.480
think I'm excited about smoking a man. I don't want to cheat this dude. He's got

03:00.480 --> 03:04.240
hair and bones and the whole deal. It's not going to go well.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.280
It's not going to go good, but it's legally binding.

03:07.280 --> 03:13.360
Please don't bogart my dad. No, we're talking about it too much.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.840
Please let me get some of that kind, kind dad.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.160
So anyway, that's it. We can't talk about it anymore.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.640
Just a regular amount of weed talk. Because if we're not careful,

03:24.640 --> 03:28.560
this will become 420. If we're not careful, it'll be 420 and that'll be bad for us.

03:28.560 --> 03:34.960
It's not. It's episode 421. Eventually, maybe we should just put 420 up for sale as a sponsored

03:34.960 --> 03:42.480
episode. If you want us to make 420, we did have a possible situation that we thought would be

03:42.480 --> 03:47.200
a good fit for that. That did not come together, did not congeal, which is fine.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.040
That's the biz, as Jesse keeps telling us. It's the biz.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.960
He says that a lot. Sometimes he just yells it at us.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.680
It's the biz. This is the biz. This is the biz.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.560
I never see him smoke cigarettes, except for when he's telling us about the,

04:02.560 --> 04:05.360
about the biz after we've gone through a pretty hard knock.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.440
He lights up a big long cigarette and he tells us that it is the biz

04:09.440 --> 04:11.440
and that we need to just learn to handle it.

04:11.440 --> 04:17.040
He was in there. This was actually really hard for me.

04:17.040 --> 04:22.400
I went in to ask Jesse about this sponsorship and he is in there holding court.

04:22.400 --> 04:30.880
It's him, Alex Bloomberg, Ira Glass is there, Kerry Hoffman, like the whole gang,

04:30.880 --> 04:35.280
all the luminaries are there. The Illuminated Aries?

04:35.280 --> 04:37.680
Is that what you're saying? The Illuminated Aries?

04:37.680 --> 04:42.960
And he's like, hey, Alex, I was like, hey, Jesse, I wanted to see how that sponsorship was going.

04:42.960 --> 04:50.560
And Jesse says, hey, Alex, watch this. He takes the ashtray full of cigarette butts

04:50.560 --> 04:54.800
because he had been getting stoked for this and just upends them onto my lap.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.240
And some of them are still hot. Yeah.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.560
So I'm kind of like, I'm just like patting my crotch really fast.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.320
You don't need to worry about wiener burns for sure.

05:02.320 --> 05:07.520
Everybody's like losing it. Adam Carolla, everybody's like loving it.

05:07.520 --> 05:14.080
And then Jesse takes this glass ashtray, which is heavy as all get out,

05:14.080 --> 05:19.280
and just chucks it right at my head. And I black out. There's blood.

05:19.280 --> 05:26.240
Alex Bloomberg, loving it, losing it, absolutely in stitches about this.

05:26.240 --> 05:30.000
And Jesse comes over and he has one more cigarette.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
He's like, oh, hey, you spilled my ashtray. So this is your problem now.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.560
And he flicks the cigarette in my mouth. Yeah.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.880
He says, it's the biz. Yeah.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.720
And then he makes me leave. In that whole interaction, Justin,

05:42.720 --> 05:46.400
about how many cigarettes did Jesse smoke just from start?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.880
Eight. Eight cigarettes from start to finish.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.360
I mean, he's like crushing them. Yeah.

05:51.920 --> 05:57.120
Now, eight like in a lot or like all at once? Three at once.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.600
Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:59.600 --> 06:04.800
And how many of them were in like long kind of very intricate holders?

06:05.520 --> 06:10.720
The first three were in long intricate holders,

06:10.720 --> 06:15.920
and he inhaled those in one drag. He pulled down three cigarettes in one drag.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.600
Then he had a coughing fit that lasted for around 15 minutes,

06:19.600 --> 06:24.160
but everybody was like frozen solid. You could tell that like this had

06:24.160 --> 06:28.320
happened before and somebody had spoke and maybe it hadn't gone so good for them.

06:28.320 --> 06:34.000
So everybody just like froze in terror. They got two ashtrays thrown right at them.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.760
Yeah. And not only that,

06:35.760 --> 06:38.880
what I've heard, and maybe this is just a complete rumor,

06:38.880 --> 06:42.320
but I've heard if you record those coughing fits and slow them down,

06:43.120 --> 06:47.360
those are full episodes of Bullseye in each column. Yeah, sure.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.520
That's how we do it. That's how we do it.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.880
Everybody wonders where podcasts come from. There you go.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.680
Well, it all starts when Jesse smokes three cigarettes

06:55.680 --> 07:01.280
like a cartoon, The Devil from the 1930s. And then he sees a podcast that he likes

07:01.280 --> 07:05.760
and he's like, oh, God. And he turns into a wolf.

07:05.760 --> 07:11.120
Speaking of wolf, it was weird how Scott Ackerman kept asking if he could take my thumbs.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.000
And Jesse was like, no, Scott. No.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.440
And Scott Ackerman was like, please. Let me have the thumbs, Jesse.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.880
Take them literally. This was not like some kind of metaphor.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.920
Yo, take my thumbs. Oh, no, dude. You ever seen that dude's thorax?

07:25.920 --> 07:27.680
Covered with thumbs. Yeah.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.240
Scott Ackerman wanted to take my thumbs, but Jesse wouldn't let him.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.280
Really? Yeah.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.000
Really? Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.720
Huh. Yeah, you lay him down flat on the floor

07:34.720 --> 07:37.680
like he's planking and he just walks on the thumbs. It's horrible.

07:37.680 --> 07:42.080
It's horrible to watch. Was the floating entity known as Gumhead there?

07:43.680 --> 07:47.200
Gumhead, of course, who started head gum. I'm sorry, not a lot of people know this.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.680
It was started by a living, floating celestial being, maybe?

07:51.680 --> 07:56.320
Do you mean former guest spurts, Jake and Amir? Yes, correct.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.160
Well, that's their human form. Jake and Amir were there.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.000
That's their human form. But when they joined together, they become Gumhead.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.000
Wow. Did I mention Carrie Hoffman tased me?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.840
And I was already on the ground. It was uncalled for.

08:09.840 --> 08:14.320
But she was like, PR XXX and then jam it into my chest. It sucked.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.160
She already had the taser charged up. She was ready for it.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.600
Yeah, sure. It was miserable.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.560
Anyway, let's get to the questions. Here's our first one.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.960
A couple of weeks ago, I was walking downtown and a guy

08:24.960 --> 08:28.320
and his girlfriend asked me for change for a dollar.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.880
We were near a parking meter, so this seemed reasonable to me,

08:30.880 --> 08:33.760
and I pulled out my wallet. The guy immediately grabbed my wallet

08:33.760 --> 08:38.800
out of my hands and ran about a block, a half of a block away with it.

08:38.800 --> 08:43.040
Then he turned back around and gave me my wallet back.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.000
In the end, I guess he stole my cash, which amounted to about $5.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.040
What happened? Was it a prank?

08:51.040 --> 08:54.720
No, no, you can't leave. You left out a savory fucking juice.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.760
Okay, okay, sorry.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.800
You gotta give them the whole truth.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.800
I skipped a parenthetical. Shame on me.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.200
In the end, I guess he stole my cash, which amounted to $5.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.880
Actually, it was $6, but he left me $1.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.160
A juicy deed.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.880
What happened? Was it a prank? Did he give up?

09:09.600 --> 09:11.120
Is this a thing that happens?

09:11.120 --> 09:14.960
I mean, it was technically the theft of $5, but I was so relieved,

09:14.960 --> 09:18.160
I went out to cancel and replace my cards, and I'm okay with that.

09:18.160 --> 09:21.840
And it says, from never going downtown again.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.600
This is so dope. This is my shit.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.760
This is really nice of the mugger.

09:28.320 --> 09:33.120
I mean, where you dress as the Monopoly man,

09:33.120 --> 09:36.480
and the mugger saw you and was like, ah, a juicy target.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.600
But what they didn't know is you'd spent almost all of your money,

09:39.600 --> 09:42.640
except $6, on that Monopoly man costume.

09:42.640 --> 09:48.080
Okay, we need to take, you guys are looking at the little picture.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.320
You're looking at one grain of sand on the beach.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.160
I'm going to look at the whole fucking beach.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.680
Because I don't know if this is a mugging.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.320
I'm not convinced this is a mugging.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.520
What are you thinking?

09:57.520 --> 09:59.520
Imagine if you will, you're young,

09:59.520 --> 10:03.520
and you're trying to show off to a new significant other,

10:03.520 --> 10:07.360
and you're having some fun downtown, and you're having that downtown fun,

10:07.360 --> 10:09.920
and you're having a conversation about mugging,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.400
and you say, I bet I could mug, and it would be great.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.360
And your significant other's like, nah, you won't do it.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.800
And then you walk up to somebody and you mug them a little bit.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.080
And this is not even a mugging.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.440
You got your fucking wallet back.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.760
It's a little bit of a mugging, but come on.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.600
But then you bring it back as like a jokey joke,

10:25.600 --> 10:27.280
but you did take $5 from them.

10:27.280 --> 10:32.400
So it's kind of like a cute, like flirty, like fun, flirty dare.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.200
Do you know what I mean?

10:33.200 --> 10:35.120
Like a truth or dare, fun, flirt dare.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.120
I mean, let's recontextualize this, right?

10:37.120 --> 10:38.800
If somebody broke into my house,

10:38.800 --> 10:43.280
but only stole something worth $5, how would I feel?

10:43.280 --> 10:46.000
Oh, is it a fun, well, yeah, was it a flirty dare though,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.880
with like a significant other they're trying to show off in press outside?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.240
But like they broke into my house,

10:50.240 --> 10:53.920
and they stole the magnet that I got at King's Island, right?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.560
Am I gonna, am I gonna press charges?

10:56.560 --> 10:57.200
I don't know.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.280
You catch them in the act, they spring out the window laughing.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.680
They also stole a precious necklace,

11:03.680 --> 11:06.480
but they hand you the necklace back through the broken window they smashed.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.600
And then they walk outside.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.040
You see them with a significant other,

11:09.040 --> 11:10.400
and then they show them the magnet,

11:10.400 --> 11:12.480
and then they high five and kiss and laugh.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.680
And then they walk off, and you're like,

11:13.680 --> 11:16.720
at fair dinkum, you got, you did a, it was flirty, so.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.640
It's possible that this is the perfect crime,

11:18.640 --> 11:19.360
what we're describing,

11:19.360 --> 11:20.720
because like if you go and rob a bank,

11:20.720 --> 11:22.640
and you steal millions of dollars,

11:22.640 --> 11:24.800
but you come back seconds later,

11:24.800 --> 11:26.880
you hand them back the bags of money,

11:26.880 --> 11:28.880
and you're like, here's back a million dollars,

11:28.880 --> 11:30.400
I did keep $200.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.680
And they're like, huh, okay, well,

11:34.480 --> 11:37.440
you could have made off with the millions, and you didn't.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.680
Yeah, so yeah, keep that $200.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.120
Okay, bye, thank you.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.440
Can we just create a system where like,

11:44.640 --> 11:46.800
I don't know how many muggers listen to this show,

11:46.800 --> 11:50.000
but if we could just all agree on a little bit of etiquette

11:50.000 --> 11:54.240
that listen, you're gonna make me cancel the cards,

11:54.240 --> 11:56.480
but I'm gonna cancel the cards for use the cards.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.840
There's no need for that.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.440
You don't need my license.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.800
If we could just agree that like,

12:00.800 --> 12:02.320
you're gonna, okay, you got me.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.640
Okay, you got me.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.080
And then you get my cash.

12:06.080 --> 12:06.480
All right.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.080
And we move on with that.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.280
You shouldn't have cash anyway.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.080
For now on, you just refer to the cash in your wallet

12:12.080 --> 12:13.200
as muggin' stuffins.

12:13.200 --> 12:13.600
Yeah, yeah.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.200
That's just my muggin' stuffins.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.680
It's for when I get mugged, and I will deserve it,

12:17.680 --> 12:20.000
because I was carrying all of this muggin' stuffins.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.320
Don't have too much, have six bucks in there.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.200
Duh, you got me.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.160
If we codify this, though, Justin,

12:26.160 --> 12:27.520
in the way that you're describing,

12:28.720 --> 12:30.240
I'm worried it's gonna be so easy.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.440
Can you say that real quick?

12:31.440 --> 12:32.480
Muggin' stuffins, yeah.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.200
If you have, I mean, if we have two wallets, right?

12:35.200 --> 12:36.560
What were you doing today, Bob?

12:36.560 --> 12:37.680
Muggin' stuff?

12:37.680 --> 12:39.920
Yeah, we got a right butt cheek wallet,

12:39.920 --> 12:41.840
and in that one we have driver's license,

12:41.840 --> 12:43.440
easily cancelable credit cards,

12:43.440 --> 12:47.600
pictures of our kids and loved ones.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.320
And then our left butt cheek, we have a smaller wallet.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.880
This one is going to contain all our money,

12:52.880 --> 12:57.200
and then maybe a punch card for a Subway sandwich

12:57.200 --> 12:58.240
that you have all the way going.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.920
Because if I was a mugger and I saw that,

12:59.920 --> 13:02.560
I'd be like, hmm, hell yeah, that's six bucks right there.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.120
And then when you get mugged, you're like,

13:05.120 --> 13:06.960
oh, here, just take my left wallet.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.840
Just take my left wallet, this is my muggin' stuffins.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.120
I'm worried if we do that, Justin,

13:11.120 --> 13:12.880
it's gonna be kind of flag football.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.880
I'm worried it's gonna be so easy to mug people

13:14.880 --> 13:16.800
that I might start doing it.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.520
Because if you got me.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.520
Okay, so you mugged Steve, right?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.920
But then Jerry turns around and mugs you.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.440
What if there's just one, okay,

13:25.440 --> 13:28.080
what if we make it there's just one money wallet?

13:29.200 --> 13:31.280
And everybody's mugging, everybody going,

13:31.280 --> 13:32.320
do you have the money wallet?

13:33.520 --> 13:34.320
That's socialism.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.760
You've moved away from the core argument, which is this.

13:38.560 --> 13:42.160
If you make mugging a crime, only the criminals will mug.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.720
Wouldn't it be more fun if getting mugged

13:46.720 --> 13:51.360
could become something of an opportunity to meet new people?

13:51.360 --> 13:52.480
Sure, sure.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.320
And just don't have too much cash in your wallet

13:54.320 --> 13:55.840
so it's not gonna cost you too much.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.560
You're just getting mugged, and it's not a crime.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.160
So the person mugging you is not a criminal.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.520
They could be your neighbor, your best friend, whatever.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.760
You are getting mugged, though, and it's a shakedown.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.240
And here's the one thing about this system that I've created

14:08.800 --> 14:10.880
which may have some flaws, it's too early to say.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.720
If you don't give them the wallet, they will fuck you up.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.000
They have carte blanche.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.040
Okay, okay, okay.

14:17.040 --> 14:17.540
Oh.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a real mug.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.200
It's a real mug.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.560
It's a real mug.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.680
It's just not illegal.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.960
Man, Juice, I gotta say,

14:26.960 --> 14:29.680
you sound like the Dark Knight's the Joker right now.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.520
Like just hella chaos and...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.440
I love chasing cars.

14:34.320 --> 14:34.560
Really?

14:35.760 --> 14:36.320
Can I do a Yahoo?

14:36.320 --> 14:37.280
Wait, do you?

14:37.280 --> 14:38.000
Wait, what?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.440
Justin, do you chase cars?

14:39.440 --> 14:41.520
I'm like a pup chasing a car,

14:41.520 --> 14:45.680
and I'm loving the hunt of the car and just going for it.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.280
24 Sev, chaos too.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.240
Oh, baby.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.240
Yeah, when I get that car, I'm gonna bite it a lot.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.720
I almost finished his famous monologue

14:52.720 --> 14:54.640
that I memorized verbatim, Griffin.

14:54.640 --> 14:54.960
Sorry, keep going.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.560
Can I please finish the Joker's monologue?

14:56.560 --> 14:57.600
Yeah, please, please, please.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.960
I gotta start over at the beginning.

14:58.960 --> 14:59.600
Okay.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.400
Can I be Harvey Dent?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.760
Uh, yeah.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.240
Okay.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.720
Oh, man, this burns a lot.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.320
This is a real stinger.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.680
Are you Batman, Travis?

15:07.680 --> 15:11.200
Uh, yeah, I guess, if that's the only one left.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.320
Okay, but he's not in this scene,

15:12.320 --> 15:14.240
so please respect that.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.760
I gotta hold my mouth like this.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.000
I'm just like a dog chasing a car.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.560
Hey, is the Joker in here?

15:23.600 --> 15:24.800
Yeah, it's me, the Joker.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.400
Sit down, I'm doing a monologue.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.800
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.520
No, that's fine.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.640
I'll start at the beginning.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.360
It's pretty good.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.400
I need a ointment.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.560
I'm just like a dog chasing a car

15:36.560 --> 15:38.400
for the love of the chase

15:38.400 --> 15:41.520
and to keep my exercise fitness at 100%.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.760
You gotta get your steps in.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.440
I'm starting over.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.640
I'm just like a dog.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.960
Stop interrupting me, Batman.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.040
I'm like a dog chasing a car.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.480
Did somebody knock something over?

15:54.480 --> 15:58.480
No, I'm flipping a coin to see if I should blow you goons away.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.520
Shoot your asses.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.880
I'm starting over.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.000
I'm just like a dog.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.400
And I'm chasing a car.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.720
And it's my number one.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.400
A car.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.000
You wanna get nuts?

16:16.640 --> 16:17.360
No.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.280
You ever danced with the devil

16:19.280 --> 16:21.200
while you're chasing a car?

16:21.200 --> 16:21.840
Yeah, yeah.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.480
Oh, well, you sure do lick yourself a lot.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.080
Give me your wallet, Joker.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.560
You'll never get it.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.440
Okay, well, now I have to beat you up.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.280
I have 100 wallets

16:37.280 --> 16:39.040
and I'm gonna set them all on fire.

16:40.400 --> 16:40.720
Okay.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.520
And scene.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.840
That's how, of course, that was not a recording

16:46.480 --> 16:49.600
of the famous film Batman Does It Again.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.040
That was us doing it.

16:53.040 --> 16:53.680
Weirdly enough.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.560
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo?

16:55.360 --> 16:56.080
Yeah, I do.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.200
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

16:59.200 --> 16:59.840
Thank you, Adrian.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.800
It's Yahoo Answers user Jules who asks,

17:04.640 --> 17:08.080
my stupid brother might have given my dog a Twizzler.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.120
How can I tell for sure?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.440
Breaking it down.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.080
I wanna get forensic on this motherfucker

17:14.880 --> 17:16.880
and figure out how we can figure out

17:16.880 --> 17:20.080
how they can figure out if their stupid brother

17:20.080 --> 17:21.920
did give their dog a Twizzler

17:21.920 --> 17:23.200
and how they can tell for sure.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.680
If it was a gusher, it would be easy.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.720
A gusher would be easy

17:26.720 --> 17:28.720
because there would be dribbling juice

17:28.720 --> 17:30.400
down the doggy's chin.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.000
And that would be so easy to diagnose.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.600
You would get near the chin, smell it.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.560
If it smelled like watermelon or a grape.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.000
The dog's head would have become a watermelon, Griffin.

17:40.000 --> 17:40.880
Of course.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.080
How silly of me.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.400
That is the joke you were making

17:44.400 --> 17:45.360
and I fucked it up.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.880
Start it again.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.040
Read the question again, start over.

17:49.040 --> 17:49.760
My stupid brother might-

17:49.760 --> 17:51.600
If it was a gusher, it would be easy.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.640
Because of fruit head.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.800
Justin, any jokes?

17:55.520 --> 17:57.440
No, I wanna hear the question for once.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.000
My stupid brother might have given my dog a Twizzler.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.040
How can I tell for sure?

18:02.480 --> 18:03.680
Well, if it was an airhead,

18:03.680 --> 18:05.360
his head would have blown up real big.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.640
It's a shame it wasn't that.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.080
All right, all right, all right.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.280
If it was a tizzy roll pop,

18:09.280 --> 18:11.600
an owl would have come and taken it.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.680
So any other fun candy commercial sort of things?

18:15.680 --> 18:16.720
If it was Skittles,

18:16.720 --> 18:20.240
Skittles would have popped all over his face and body.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.280
Because Skittles pops.

18:22.000 --> 18:22.560
Yeah.

18:22.560 --> 18:27.280
If it was, fuck, shit.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.520
My favorite candy bar, fuck shit.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.800
There's probably not a ring pop.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.440
Do you remember the great slogan for that one?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.040
How they get so many goddamn nuts?

18:37.040 --> 18:41.040
Fuck shit, fuck shit.

18:41.040 --> 18:41.540
Hey.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.280
It was actually the first candy that was ever

18:47.280 --> 18:49.200
discontinued before it was released.

18:49.200 --> 18:53.200
So you see a lot of retro sites that have like,

18:53.200 --> 18:54.800
do you remember this?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.480
Hey, 90s kids, remember this one?

18:56.480 --> 18:57.360
And we all say no.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.680
It's like, well, it was discontinued, wasn't it?

18:59.680 --> 19:00.240
All right.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.880
There was a kid in middle school who swore up and down

19:02.880 --> 19:04.560
that he had had a fuck shit once.

19:04.560 --> 19:09.040
But when pressed, he couldn't really give us any details,

19:09.040 --> 19:11.680
except that there was a goddamn lot of nuts in it.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.680
He said there was so many goddamn nuts.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.480
His uncle, he said, worked at the fuck shit factory.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.360
But here's the thing about the fuck shit factory.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.040
Nobody ever goes in.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.800
Nobody ever comes out.

19:24.080 --> 19:29.280
Come with me and you'll be in this fucking righteous candy

19:29.280 --> 19:30.400
factory.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.680
We got nuts.

19:31.680 --> 19:36.320
Holy shit, do we have nuts?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.240
I actually one time I got invited

19:38.240 --> 19:40.240
to go into the fuck shit factory.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.000
But then Mr.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.960
Fuckworth came by and he told me that he would give me,

19:46.720 --> 19:51.120
his words, a goddamn lot of nuts if I would deliver to him

19:51.120 --> 19:52.560
the fuck shit recipe.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.760
And I ran and ran and I never stopped running,

19:55.760 --> 19:56.960
if I'm being honest.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.520
And I think that really has led me to where I am now.

19:59.520 --> 20:07.200
So the Twizzler, the dog ate a Twizzler, I think.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.200
And so I just want to help this person.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.080
So we've had a lot of fun just cussing a bunch,

20:12.080 --> 20:13.760
but I wonder if we could help this person

20:13.760 --> 20:16.240
whose dog might be Twizzler sick.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.000
If you scrubs want to eat my goddamn nuts,

20:20.640 --> 20:23.280
are you sure that you can handle it?

20:23.280 --> 20:28.800
Here's the thing about dogs and Twizzlers.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.200
They don't like them.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.040
You don't or dogs don't?

20:36.400 --> 20:36.960
You know what?

20:36.960 --> 20:38.560
I'm ambivalent to them.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.480
They're definitely better than Red Vines.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.200
Don't at me.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.520
But I don't think a dog would like a Twizzler, would they?

20:45.520 --> 20:49.120
I mean, my dog would literally eat anything.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.320
It's just the gummy consistency is probably not a dog's fave.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.760
But regardless, that's-

20:57.760 --> 20:59.120
How can we know for sure?

20:59.120 --> 21:02.400
I don't want to do an Ian Malcolm Dookie analysis.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.480
Actually, he wasn't into it, was he?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.080
He hated that they were putting their hands

21:06.080 --> 21:07.440
inside the Dino Dookie.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.080
So I did a quick search of Animal Hub,

21:10.080 --> 21:12.560
where I get all my facts and figures.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.080
And the answer to this question that was posed by Seth

21:16.080 --> 21:17.760
Can dogs eat Twizzlers?

21:17.760 --> 21:23.120
And here's the answer for y'all to specifically answer

21:23.120 --> 21:25.600
the question, can dogs eat Twizzlers?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.600
Strictly, the answer is yes.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.480
Okay.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.120
And there's no harm done for the dogs to ingest them.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.920
Besides, they are known to be safe for consumption

21:33.920 --> 21:35.440
as even kids love to eat them.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.840
So wait, here's what it says here.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.160
Too much is bad.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.560
Twizzlers may be safe for dogs.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.640
However, they should not eat them.

21:44.640 --> 21:47.040
For dogs, however, they should not be recommended

21:47.040 --> 21:49.360
to be given to your dogs in large quantity.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.280
Fucking shit.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, for sure.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.440
Okay, but also you can't say like kids like to eat them

21:57.440 --> 21:59.920
so it's safe because my kid likes grapes.

21:59.920 --> 22:04.240
And if I give my dog a grape, I believe she'll explode.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.480
So like, that's not a good metric for that.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.480
My kid also loves chocolate.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.320
Like that's not a good metric.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.400
Are dogs not supposed to do grapes?

22:12.400 --> 22:13.360
No.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.880
Oh shit, I gotta go.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.880
Mr. Barfleet?

22:18.880 --> 22:19.840
Mr. Barfleet?

22:25.280 --> 22:30.000
Well, well, I guess I should ask.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.080
Does anybody know how to make a dog poop now?

22:34.560 --> 22:35.200
To get it out.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.640
Twizzlers.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.520
We'll give them diarrhea.

22:37.520 --> 22:41.200
Hi brothers, I work at a grocery store deli in a rural area

22:41.200 --> 22:44.240
and a few days ago, someone came to the counter

22:44.240 --> 22:48.000
who I am 95% sure is a moderately famous Hollywood actor.

22:48.960 --> 22:49.920
Stop, stop, stop.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.280
Let's just scroll through the question

22:51.280 --> 22:52.960
and see if they say who the actor is.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.880
Because it's not, I don't think it is.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.840
And if this is the case, like how can we approach this one

22:57.840 --> 22:59.600
in good faith, fam?

22:59.600 --> 23:01.040
Yeah, we can't.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.400
You have to tell us who it is.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.520
Email us next week.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.320
Try it again.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.560
Email us again next week and let us know who it is

23:08.560 --> 23:09.600
because we can't.

23:09.600 --> 23:13.120
That is true because like there are Hollywood celebs

23:13.120 --> 23:15.920
that if you said they got away to a rural area,

23:15.920 --> 23:17.120
I'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.520
This is the first time we've ever sent something back

23:19.520 --> 23:20.240
for a second draft.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.360
Send it in, say who it is.

23:21.360 --> 23:25.360
We'll do this one again, but we can't not know.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.080
Yes, and please include the original text of your question.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.600
We have to know who the person is.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.080
It means everything.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.440
And use the same sign off.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.440
We won't say it here, but that way I can search.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.920
And actually reply to your first email that you sent

23:37.920 --> 23:38.960
to keep it like thread.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.440
And send us a Bitcoin for a hundred dollars.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.800
I work in an office building.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.320
I want a $300 of Bitcoin.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.560
I work in an office building that has a kitchen

23:50.560 --> 23:52.400
and we've discovered that many of our spoons

23:52.400 --> 23:54.640
are going missing at an alarming rate.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.880
My boss has personally bought new spoons

23:56.880 --> 23:58.640
to replace the missing ones on enough occasions

23:58.640 --> 24:01.040
that she dressed up as a spoon for Halloween

24:01.600 --> 24:03.200
to remind people of the issue.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.560
Sounds like a fun person.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.600
She won the costume competition in case you're wondering.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.640
I was.

24:08.640 --> 24:09.200
I was.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.760
Where are our spoons going?

24:11.760 --> 24:13.040
And how could I stop this from happening?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.720
That's from burglarized in Baltimore.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.440
Oh, I got it.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.000
I know.

24:16.000 --> 24:16.880
What is it?

24:16.880 --> 24:18.320
Up your butt and around the corner.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.040
Next question.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.480
Okay.

24:20.480 --> 24:20.980
Wow.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.040
Right, a little intense.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.720
I wish this would happen to me because I have a sad story

24:26.720 --> 24:27.280
for y'all.

24:27.280 --> 24:32.000
I a few years ago was in need of spoons

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
because we were out and we went through a lot.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.280
I was in need of spoons.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.800
And I got a container of spoons

24:39.360 --> 24:40.720
and it was like an eight pack, right?

24:40.720 --> 24:43.200
It's like eight spoons, eight forks, eight knives.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.480
Get home, put them into the silverware drawer

24:46.480 --> 24:48.560
and you'll never believe this.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.280
What?

24:49.280 --> 24:51.200
I hate these spoons.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.240
Oh, no.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.960
I hate these spoons.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.760
What's wrong?

24:55.760 --> 24:58.320
They feel, okay, one, they have no heft.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.160
They feel like they're made of plastic.

25:00.160 --> 25:03.920
Two, the top is shaped like baby spoons.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.600
Baby spoons, I can't get four crunches of Cap'n Crunch in here.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.680
I can't get, I can't get four biscuits.

25:09.680 --> 25:15.840
It's a shallow, narrow, tiny spoon that is weak

25:16.560 --> 25:21.360
and there is nothing powerful about this spoon.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.680
It is a weak spoon that I hate.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.600
And I have eight of them now and I would do anything

25:27.600 --> 25:30.160
if someone could give me an excuse to replace these spoons.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.320
Please, Spoon Thief, if you're hearing this,

25:32.320 --> 25:33.520
come steal my spoons.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.200
Yeah, these miserable spoons.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.480
Can we all agree?

25:36.480 --> 25:38.480
I have not reached into the silverware drawer

25:38.480 --> 25:41.840
when I needed a friendly spoon to help me eat my cereal soups

25:41.840 --> 25:43.920
or whatever, what have you.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.840
I have not reached into that drawer

25:45.840 --> 25:51.760
and mindfully chosen a small spoon, a little spoon,

25:52.560 --> 25:55.440
I guess a teaspoon over a big boy spoon

25:55.440 --> 25:57.440
since I was an eight years old.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.440
That's a wild choice to make.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.440
Why would I, do you want to work twice as hard

26:01.440 --> 26:02.960
for the same amount of soup?

26:02.960 --> 26:03.600
Nah, I don't.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.000
I want to carry a lot of soup up to my mouth with each go

26:08.000 --> 26:10.800
and I don't know why the littler spoons even exist.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.800
I want the spoon to endanger the corners of my mouth.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.760
I will say that with Big Fork versus Tiny Fork,

26:17.760 --> 26:19.360
Tiny Fork, sometimes I look and I'm like,

26:19.360 --> 26:20.960
yeah, this is a thin food.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.640
I don't need that Big Fork.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.160
This is a conservationist.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.600
I'm gonna save my energy.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.480
I don't need to lift the extra weight of the Big Fork.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.560
But with the spoon, I agree with you, Griffin.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.120
Those little spoons, that's for my baby now.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.320
My baby can have those spoons.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.240
How cool would this movie be if I was having

26:37.120 --> 26:40.720
dinner with the queen and I showed up on my scooter

26:40.720 --> 26:43.360
I rented from the street and I rode into Buckingham

26:43.920 --> 26:46.240
and rolled up to the table and then they were like,

26:46.240 --> 26:48.800
you're late and I was like, fuck off and sat down

26:48.800 --> 26:50.960
and I threw my backpack under the table.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.400
And then they started and they served up a soup

26:54.400 --> 26:59.360
and I took like four of the seven sort of implements

26:59.360 --> 27:02.000
that were lining my plate and I just threw them

27:02.000 --> 27:04.160
to the ground and they're like, what are you doing?

27:04.160 --> 27:07.120
And I was like, gang, you only need the big spoon

27:07.120 --> 27:10.720
and you need the Big Fork and maybe a knife for hard meat

27:10.720 --> 27:11.440
and that's it.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.080
And then they all were like, oh shit, you're right.

27:14.080 --> 27:18.160
And then I pulled out my boombox and we had a party

27:18.160 --> 27:19.600
and that's the end of the movie.

27:19.600 --> 27:23.200
And so this one's called Manners Schmanners

27:23.200 --> 27:24.000
and Travis, I am gonna-

27:24.000 --> 27:24.640
Wait a minute.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.240
Yeah, no, I'm gonna need to borrow it.

27:26.240 --> 27:30.400
But this is, it's what I believe in, really strong

27:30.400 --> 27:34.240
and I think Mike Myers is gonna play every role but me.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.280
Okay, and to solve your problem,

27:38.080 --> 27:40.400
Burglarized in Baltimore, what you're gonna wanna do

27:40.400 --> 27:43.520
is much like coffee shops do, you wanna get a bigger spoon,

27:44.160 --> 27:46.320
chain that to the regular spoons

27:46.960 --> 27:49.680
and so that way people are less likely to steal it

27:49.680 --> 27:51.840
because it has like a big dangly, I don't know,

27:51.840 --> 27:55.280
a spatula or a spoon, maybe just a big piece of wood

27:55.280 --> 27:58.320
on there, something so they have to return the spoon

27:58.320 --> 27:58.960
back to you.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.320
Would it be helpful if, this is a thought,

28:02.320 --> 28:05.680
what if you see a big stack of spoons,

28:05.680 --> 28:08.960
huge stack of spoons, big sexy spoons

28:08.960 --> 28:10.960
with the curve just the way you like,

28:10.960 --> 28:12.240
what's the first thing you wanna do?

28:12.880 --> 28:15.360
Put it right up my butt, take it around the corner.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.640
Exactly, stuff right in your pocket.

28:16.640 --> 28:20.400
What if there's just one spoon for the whole office

28:21.040 --> 28:23.200
and it's like, it's a member of the family.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.240
If somebody steals this motherfucker, it's on.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.320
And you know it because you were waiting on it.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.080
You were waiting on the spoon.

28:30.080 --> 28:33.360
You cannot get that spoon out of the break room, no way.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.080
Someone else needs to stir their Cremora

28:36.080 --> 28:39.200
into their decaf, they need a spoon.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.440
I'm just going over your yearly review here,

28:41.440 --> 28:42.800
your numbers have been good,

28:43.440 --> 28:45.520
your customer service reviews are way up.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.960
Now I do see here that you hog the spoon.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.680
Did you hog a little bit of a spoon hog, Victoria?

28:51.680 --> 28:53.520
You're fired.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.520
Spoon hog.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.600
It's my favorite James Bond villain.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.480
It's a good one.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.640
So what if we have everybody in the office-

29:02.640 --> 29:05.120
You say there's enough spoons for you.

29:06.640 --> 29:11.520
Never enough spoons for you, spoon hog.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.360
Never a fork will do.

29:17.360 --> 29:22.640
Why not a spoon of two thousand?

29:22.640 --> 29:27.440
Why not a spoon hog?

29:29.280 --> 29:31.120
What if everybody has their own spoon?

29:32.160 --> 29:35.920
I gotta point out, I was doing kind of a parody cover

29:35.920 --> 29:38.400
of Soundgarden's Spoon Man, but Justin took it

29:38.400 --> 29:40.400
and ran with it in such a different direction.

29:40.400 --> 29:46.320
A parody cover of Chris Cornell's theme from Casino Royale.

29:46.320 --> 29:48.720
Yeah, but I mean, Skyfall would have matched

29:48.720 --> 29:51.040
sort of the rhythm of Skyfall.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.560
Or like Goldfinger, you could have done like Spoonfinger.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.040
Mine was not a parody, it was a pastiche.

29:57.040 --> 29:57.600
I was capturing-

29:57.600 --> 29:59.120
Oh, an homage?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.400
It was an homage.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.600
I was capturing, it's like how, you know,

30:04.640 --> 30:06.320
that Weird Al song, Everything You Know Is Wrong,

30:06.320 --> 30:08.720
it's sort of like a tone parody or a pastiche

30:08.720 --> 30:09.760
of They Might Be Giants?

30:09.760 --> 30:11.040
That's kind of what I was going for.

30:11.040 --> 30:16.800
A soundalike, a tone parody, a pastiche.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.040
Yeah, maybe if we say pastiche 80 more times-

30:19.040 --> 30:20.880
Can we just go to the money tone?

30:31.920 --> 30:33.120
We've never done this before,

30:33.120 --> 30:35.440
but we're just going to go back and forth on this one.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.880
Ant vs. Ant.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.880
Yeah, okay, all right.

30:38.880 --> 30:42.000
You know, folks, hiring is challenging, right Griffin?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.960
Yeah, I hate doing it, but there are lots of,

30:44.960 --> 30:46.640
well, there's not, there's really just the one way

30:46.640 --> 30:48.240
to make things easier, huh, Juice?

30:48.240 --> 30:51.040
Yeah, that place is ZipRecruiter, isn't it, Griffin?

30:51.040 --> 30:53.120
Yeah, they make hiring simple, fast, and smart,

30:53.120 --> 30:54.080
isn't that right, Travis?

30:54.880 --> 31:00.480
No, yeah, yes, ZipRecruiter sends your job

31:00.480 --> 31:02.560
to over how many, Griffin?

31:02.560 --> 31:03.920
100, Travis?

31:03.920 --> 31:08.080
Of the webs, Justin, leading job boards,

31:08.080 --> 31:09.920
but it's true, they don't stop there

31:09.920 --> 31:12.000
with their powerful matching technology.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.960
ZipRecruiter will scan your DNA and your blood-

31:14.960 --> 31:16.240
Whoa!

31:16.240 --> 31:18.640
And they'll steal your DNA and your blood,

31:18.640 --> 31:22.080
and they'll legally force you to take whatever job

31:22.080 --> 31:24.880
they see as the right fit for your genetic makeup.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.280
It's like The Giver, it's kind of like The Giver.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.400
Basically The Giver.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.680
When you're born, ZipRecruiter assigns you a job.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.480
And that's not-

31:32.480 --> 31:34.320
Do you feel a chip in the back of your neck?

31:34.320 --> 31:36.560
That's ZipRecruiter, you already have it.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.240
That's ZipRecruiter there.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.760
Now, can you see colors?

31:39.760 --> 31:40.960
Do you feel emotions?

31:40.960 --> 31:44.640
Good news, ZipRecruiter has designated you as a giver.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.320
Okay, I have to tell you legally

31:46.320 --> 31:48.560
what the gene splicers at ZipRecruiter actually do

31:48.560 --> 31:50.320
is they scan thousands of resumes

31:50.320 --> 31:53.280
using their latent psychic gene powers to find people

31:53.280 --> 31:54.880
with the right experience and invite them

31:54.880 --> 31:56.320
to apply to your job.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.000
That's what they actually do.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.800
All right, now we can go back to goof arounds.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.400
Right now, our listeners can try ZipRecruiter for free

32:04.400 --> 32:07.040
at this exclusive web address.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.280
Folks, that's underlined and bold and italicized.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.080
So ZipRecruiter really wanted me to say out loud,

32:14.080 --> 32:19.440
exclusive web address, ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

32:19.440 --> 32:25.520
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.720
ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.

32:29.360 --> 32:34.080
Advertisers don't keep advertising with you

32:34.080 --> 32:36.560
if it fits a direct response like this, right?

32:36.560 --> 32:39.840
The way this game works is advertisers take out an ad

32:39.840 --> 32:40.720
and they have something like that,

32:40.720 --> 32:42.800
that link that you're supposed to use

32:43.440 --> 32:44.800
to try ZipRecruiter for free.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.960
And if enough people use that, it's called direct response.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.800
They know that people are using that thing.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.280
They heard it on our show and we did a good ad

32:51.280 --> 32:52.160
and so people are using it.

32:52.160 --> 32:55.760
ZipRecruiter has been advertising with us for years.

32:55.760 --> 33:02.080
So shockingly, at some point, apparently at many points,

33:02.080 --> 33:04.880
our listeners of My Brother, My Brother, and Me

33:04.880 --> 33:07.680
have been listening to the three of us chuckle fucks

33:07.680 --> 33:10.240
and thought, oh, these are the guys I should turn to

33:10.240 --> 33:11.200
for hiring advice.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.440
I'm gonna do what they told me to do.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.760
Like a lot of you do it and thank you so much,

33:15.760 --> 33:17.040
but it's very shocking to me.

33:17.040 --> 33:20.000
This is how undeniable the ZipRecruiter service is.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.800
It sounds so strong and powerful

33:22.800 --> 33:26.080
that even three dum-dums cannot fuck it up.

33:26.080 --> 33:26.880
It's so good.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.000
It's ZipRecruiter.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.040
You got to.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.640
Can I tell you about Squarespace?

33:30.640 --> 33:32.000
Please do. Yeah, okay.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.440
Okay, but in doing this,

33:33.440 --> 33:35.760
I'm actually gonna promote my own project

33:35.760 --> 33:37.760
that I use Squarespace to correct.

33:37.760 --> 33:41.520
You can go to buttercupisaveverygoodgirl.com

33:41.520 --> 33:43.920
to find a website I made on Squarespace

33:43.920 --> 33:46.560
in about five minutes that is just a slideshow

33:47.200 --> 33:49.120
of nice pictures of my dog, Buttercup,

33:49.120 --> 33:50.000
who is very cute.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.600
I think it's a very good website.

33:53.600 --> 33:57.360
And like I said, it was really like maybe five minutes

33:57.360 --> 33:58.960
and that's what Squarespace does.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.800
Cause you can, let's see, let me run through

34:00.800 --> 34:01.600
what I did here.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.120
Create a beautiful website too.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.120
Turn your cool idea into a new website.

34:05.120 --> 34:05.920
Check.

34:05.920 --> 34:06.880
Showcase your work.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.640
I took these pictures of Buttercup.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.280
Check.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.360
Announce an upcoming event or special project.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.560
This is a special project.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.200
Check.

34:13.200 --> 34:14.160
And more.

34:14.160 --> 34:14.560
Check.

34:15.120 --> 34:15.620
What?

34:16.720 --> 34:18.240
Website sucks.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.120
No, Buttercup is a very good girl.com.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.400
I'm looking at it now, man.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.560
There's no fucking games.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.800
There's no like flash animations.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.440
There's a slideshow of good dog pictures.

34:30.640 --> 34:33.120
There's like six pics, but no games.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.800
I have a frequently asked question section.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.200
I've got about Buttercup section.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.760
Why exactly did you put your credit card

34:41.760 --> 34:43.280
in so many of these pictures?

34:43.280 --> 34:46.560
You can make it out in literally every other one.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.880
Can you fucking update the homepage at least

34:48.880 --> 34:51.200
to have it say like games are coming?

34:51.200 --> 34:54.800
Yeah, I will add games on the way under construction.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.320
I haven't finished the website yet,

34:56.320 --> 34:57.680
but please come back to it.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.520
I'm sorry, there's no games yet.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.920
I'll add some flash dating games

35:01.920 --> 35:03.120
where you can date Buttercup.

35:03.120 --> 35:03.680
Is that weird?

35:04.240 --> 35:06.000
No, I just want one where she's running around

35:06.000 --> 35:07.840
grabbing bones and her bark's turning

35:07.840 --> 35:09.120
into fireballs or something.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.200
But like, just think about it, bud.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.320
That'll come in Buttercup is a very good girl.com 2.0.

35:14.320 --> 35:14.640
Okay.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.640
But if you want to make a website

35:18.640 --> 35:21.680
dedicated to your pet, you can do so.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.160
And you can do it very easily

35:24.160 --> 35:25.760
because Squarespace has beautiful templates

35:25.760 --> 35:27.200
created by world-class designers

35:27.200 --> 35:28.960
and powerful e-commerce functionality.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.800
So if I want to start selling Buttercup merch

35:30.800 --> 35:32.080
through my website, I can.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.000
Free and secure hosting,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.120
so I'm not worried about people like hacking.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.560
Buttercup is a very good girl.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.200
Oh God, now I'm worried about it.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.440
And there's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.080
So head to squarespace.com slash my brother

35:46.080 --> 35:46.800
for a free trial.

35:46.800 --> 35:47.760
And when you're ready to launch,

35:47.760 --> 35:49.760
use the offer code my brother, all one word,

35:49.760 --> 35:51.760
to save 10% off your first purchase

35:51.760 --> 35:53.200
of a website or domain

35:53.200 --> 35:55.520
that's squarespace.com slash my brother.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.920
And then enter the code my brother, all one word.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.760
This message is for Vriska

35:59.760 --> 36:01.440
and it's from the Dirk John Hive Mine.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.920
And they requested this message

36:03.920 --> 36:05.040
and it's their money.

36:05.040 --> 36:05.680
So whatever.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.160
Vriska did nothing wrong.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.760
So there is the message that you paid money for.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.440
Maybe it's your ringtone now.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.920
Maybe it's your text message alert.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.400
I don't know.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.760
But there's Taco saying the thing

36:17.760 --> 36:19.360
that you said you wanted him to say.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.120
Maybe it's gonna be in court evidence

36:21.120 --> 36:22.000
and they'll play that in court.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.920
They'll be like, ah, shoot.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.200
I'm gonna do another one.

36:25.200 --> 36:25.760
Okay.

36:25.760 --> 36:26.480
That one was short.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.440
This is for Daniel

36:27.440 --> 36:29.040
and it's from Future Daniel.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.080
It says, hey, Daniel,

36:30.080 --> 36:31.680
why did you spend $100

36:31.680 --> 36:33.120
to have the McElroy's read this message,

36:33.120 --> 36:33.920
you dingus?

36:34.480 --> 36:36.400
Stop being fiscally irresponsible

36:36.400 --> 36:38.160
just because you're feeling sad at the moment.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.960
Oh, well, I suppose it didn't hurt.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.200
Things are looking better over here in 2018,

36:43.200 --> 36:44.880
but we can't keep doing this.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.720
And that's for Daniel

36:46.720 --> 36:48.320
and it's from Future Daniel.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.520
And that's very meta.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.560
It's very meta.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.440
I also don't think there's-

36:53.440 --> 36:54.720
That's not how that works.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.880
Yeah, I don't think that there's any way

36:56.880 --> 36:58.160
that things are looking better

36:58.160 --> 36:59.680
over here in 2018 is true.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.080
You never know for Daniel

37:02.080 --> 37:03.120
and Daniel's world.

37:03.760 --> 37:04.560
Alexa.

37:04.560 --> 37:05.440
What did Alexa do?

37:06.000 --> 37:06.880
She was telling me about

37:06.880 --> 37:08.880
the Encyclopedia Britannica for some reason.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.080
Oh, now my Alexa's gone.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.000
Ah, fuck.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.080
I wish Alexa would cuss.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.040
Here's a Jumbotron for Brian

37:19.040 --> 37:20.320
and it's from Michael who says,

37:20.320 --> 37:23.280
congratulations to my chemical engineer-ist brother

37:23.280 --> 37:25.040
on your impending bundle of joy.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.960
Hopefully by the time you hear this,

37:26.960 --> 37:29.440
I'll have convinced Allie to let our dad

37:29.440 --> 37:30.560
be called peepums,

37:30.560 --> 37:32.080
but I'm not sure that'll work.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.400
Hearing this in the resonant tones of the brothers

37:34.400 --> 37:36.560
will take the sting out of the disappointment

37:36.560 --> 37:38.720
from your band director-ist brother.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.520
And this was for May,

37:41.520 --> 37:44.640
so almost certainly the baby is here.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.640
I hope everything's going well.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.160
And it's kind of fucked up

37:48.160 --> 37:52.960
how grandpa's and grandma's get to pick their name, right?

37:52.960 --> 37:55.840
They get to pick their chosen sort of nickname.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.160
Like, dad is like, I'm peepums now.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.840
And it's like, I feel like I should get a choice in the matter.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.920
Because that's a word that is uncomfortable for me

38:03.920 --> 38:05.680
to call you, my real father.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.200
Yeah, but you're stuck with it.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.120
Welcome.

38:09.120 --> 38:09.600
Thank you.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.400
No problem.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.200
These are real podcast listeners, not actors.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.080
What do you look for in a podcast?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.160
Reliability is big for me.

38:18.160 --> 38:18.720
Power.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.680
I'd say comfort.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.200
What do you think of this?

38:25.760 --> 38:26.720
That's Jordan Jesse Go.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.760
Jordan Jesse Go?

38:27.760 --> 38:29.040
They came out of the floor?

38:30.080 --> 38:31.840
And down from the ceiling?

38:31.840 --> 38:33.200
That can't be safe.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.400
I'm upset.

38:35.040 --> 38:35.840
Can we go now?

38:36.320 --> 38:36.800
Soon.

38:38.640 --> 38:41.280
Jordan Jesse Go, a real podcast.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.440
A real podcast.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.800
Rittle me peaceful, please.

38:46.800 --> 38:47.840
No, I was about-

38:47.840 --> 38:49.440
No, Travis, please don't.

38:49.440 --> 38:49.760
Please.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.640
What were you gonna do?

38:50.640 --> 38:52.320
No, I was gonna do something.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.200
What were you gonna do?

38:53.200 --> 38:54.880
Do we have too many segments now?

38:54.880 --> 38:56.800
No, we have just enough segments.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.520
And I'm gonna do my segment instead of Travis's, okay?

38:59.520 --> 39:00.800
Well, can we do both of them?

39:01.680 --> 39:03.760
I don't know if we'll have time to do both of them.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.280
All right, can I please start?

39:05.840 --> 39:06.640
Time vote.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.000
I think I should be a tiebreaker.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.440
Okay, what do you think, Griffin?

39:09.440 --> 39:11.040
Oh, I don't know what your segment's gonna be.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.320
Well, just let me do my segment.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.520
Can I just please do my segment that I've been preparing it for like half the episode,

39:15.520 --> 39:16.000
please?

39:16.000 --> 39:16.640
I have too.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.080
I know some questions.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.360
Guys, please, please.

39:20.400 --> 39:20.720
Please.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.640
Just let me do my segment.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.520
Rittle me piss.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.280
I have a new riddle for you.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.400
Very good riddle.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.280
Wait, where did he go?

39:36.560 --> 39:36.800
Who?

39:36.800 --> 39:44.480
Your riddle me piss, the like sort of fun and sort of renaissance dancing boy turned into,

39:44.480 --> 39:47.120
yeah, went to Dagobah a little bit.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.080
It's me.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.240
Here's my riddle I have for you.

39:51.440 --> 39:55.840
In which month does money grow on trees?

39:57.520 --> 40:01.760
In which month does money grow on tree?

40:02.960 --> 40:03.840
I don't know.

40:03.840 --> 40:06.240
Well, it's a riddle.

40:08.640 --> 40:08.880
What?

40:11.520 --> 40:12.240
It's a riddle.

40:12.960 --> 40:13.440
Yeah, sure.

40:13.440 --> 40:17.360
In which month does money grow on trees?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.240
Yeah, March.

40:21.840 --> 40:22.880
Never remember.

40:24.400 --> 40:24.800
Okay.

40:28.400 --> 40:32.480
Oh my god, riddles.com, you're off the fucking chain.

40:32.480 --> 40:37.440
And it's actually N-E-V-E-R hyphen M-B-E-R.

40:37.440 --> 40:41.120
So it's not even member, it's just an unpronounceable never member.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.800
That one made me, dude, that one made me really sleepy.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.360
That's weird.

40:47.360 --> 40:51.840
A riddle's never hit me before and then like made me like want to just go straight to bed.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.000
I have a riddle for you.

40:54.000 --> 40:54.720
All right.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.160
A boy was born in 1955.

40:58.160 --> 41:02.080
Oh, he just had his 18th birthday today.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.800
How did that happen?

41:04.800 --> 41:06.160
Because of the leap year?

41:06.160 --> 41:08.080
Was it a leap year situation?

41:08.080 --> 41:09.120
No, dumbo.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.400
Well, then there's literally no other.

41:13.200 --> 41:17.040
1955 was not the year he was born.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.000
It was the hospital room he was born in.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.600
Fucking holy shit.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.360
Oh, did you not like that one?

41:25.360 --> 41:25.680
Okay, let me try this one.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.800
No, it's just like any clues would have been good, riddles.com.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.800
This has to be fucking fair.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.080
Let me try this one then, Griffin, because it was a completely separate riddle

41:34.080 --> 41:36.560
on a completely different page of riddles.com.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.920
A man was born in 1898.

41:39.920 --> 41:43.280
He is still alive now at the age of 33.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.000
How is this possible?

41:46.000 --> 41:46.560
Leap year?

41:47.760 --> 41:51.760
No, he was born in room 1898 in the hospital.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.120
I have one for you.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.320
Okay.

41:54.320 --> 41:58.160
I have four wings, but I am not a windmill.

41:58.800 --> 42:02.400
I have clawed feet, but I am not a bear.

42:03.040 --> 42:06.240
I have scales, but I am not a reptile.

42:06.800 --> 42:07.680
Who am I?

42:09.120 --> 42:09.840
Who am I?

42:11.440 --> 42:12.160
Justin.

42:12.160 --> 42:12.720
Who am I?

42:12.720 --> 42:13.220
What?

42:13.920 --> 42:16.560
What am I maybe makes more sense.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.960
I have four wings, but I'm not a windmill.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.040
No fucking shit.

42:21.040 --> 42:21.920
There's no way.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.560
Are those called wings on a windmill?

42:24.560 --> 42:26.080
Are those called wings?

42:26.880 --> 42:29.600
I have four wings, but I'm not a windmill.

42:29.600 --> 42:32.480
I have clawed feet, but I'm not a bear.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.600
I have scales, but I'm not a reptile.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.320
Who am I?

42:38.400 --> 42:39.040
I don't know.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.000
A house.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.240
No.

42:43.680 --> 42:44.640
A tub.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.040
No.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.720
Whatever you're thinking, it's horse.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.280
Is it a dragon?

42:49.280 --> 42:52.320
A butterfly or a dragonfly.

42:57.760 --> 42:58.320
What?

42:58.320 --> 43:00.960
Butterflies don't have fucking clawed feet.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.600
You can't do it like that, riddles.com.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.560
But also, no one's ever been like, be careful, that butterfly will claw you.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.760
It's never worked that way.

43:09.760 --> 43:11.600
You can't, Travis, you're missing the point.

43:11.600 --> 43:15.280
You can't have a riddle where it's like, it could be a couple different things.

43:16.240 --> 43:17.200
Take your pick.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.880
Take your pick.

43:18.880 --> 43:24.080
Yeah, the knife was made out of ice, or the chandelier fell on him.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.120
It's one of the two.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.480
Okay, have we gotten that out of our system?

43:28.480 --> 43:32.080
I feel like this segment can never last longer than like four minutes.

43:32.080 --> 43:35.280
I feel like we get in, we do a riddle, we get out.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.120
Okay, you're the boss.

43:37.120 --> 43:39.680
I just feel like if I hear too many of these riddles, I-

43:41.040 --> 43:41.520
You'll die?

43:42.480 --> 43:43.600
I might literally die.

43:43.600 --> 43:47.040
I think that when that one riddle made me sleepy, that was my body saying,

43:47.040 --> 43:48.800
okay, a few more of these and we're dead.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.440
How about a Yahoo instead?

43:51.440 --> 43:53.680
These always wake me up and make me feel amazing.

43:54.480 --> 43:57.760
Yes, here's one that was sent in by Nick Waterstrat.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.320
Thanks, Nick.

43:58.320 --> 44:01.120
It's Yahoo Answers user Jaden.

44:01.680 --> 44:02.560
Jaden asks,

44:04.960 --> 44:09.360
I'm 13 and have $82.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.360
What should I spend it on?

44:11.360 --> 44:16.880
Don't say to just save it.

44:16.880 --> 44:17.380
Huh.

44:18.160 --> 44:25.440
So $82, the only restriction Jaden has provided is that this money must be spent.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.600
Well, I mean, there's lots of restrictions.

44:27.600 --> 44:37.120
He cannot buy a cigar or a porn and he can't buy, he can't vote.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.560
But that's not a money thing, is it?

44:38.560 --> 44:42.720
Can't buy a car, I guess, with $82.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.920
I feel like this is why, for me personally speaking,

44:46.640 --> 44:50.720
trading card games were invented so that this question would always be answered for me

44:50.720 --> 44:56.000
from ages like 10 to 17, is that I would always know where $82 should be spent.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.440
And it was Magic or Pokemon or Hero Clicks.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.520
And then I did it and I didn't have to stress out about my earnings.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.360
I just knew where it was going to go.

45:05.360 --> 45:05.840
Candy?

45:06.400 --> 45:07.920
You could buy $82 worth of candy.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.480
Travis, they're fucking 13 years old.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.440
Come on.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.120
What do they need with candy?

45:13.120 --> 45:14.480
They're basically adults.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.200
I don't know, pocket knives?

45:17.200 --> 45:18.240
Can you buy that at 13?

45:18.240 --> 45:19.680
Pocket knives?

45:19.680 --> 45:21.040
Travis Patrick.

45:21.040 --> 45:23.440
I'm trying to think about what I would have bought at 13.

45:24.160 --> 45:24.720
Oh, okay.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.440
That is fair.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.480
Yeah, that's legit.

45:26.480 --> 45:29.040
I would have bought candy or pocket knives.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.840
Didn't you buy a nice steamer trunk for our bedroom?

45:31.840 --> 45:37.600
I did have one of those, yes, but I believe I got that for Christmas.

45:37.600 --> 45:38.560
That's a cool gift.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.120
I wanted a place to keep my secrets.

45:41.840 --> 45:45.040
Yeah, not a very hidden trove there, Captain Jack.

45:45.920 --> 45:48.800
Not a very, not a very, you didn't really bury that one.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.920
It was kind of a big steamer trunk in the middle of the room, wasn't it there?

45:51.920 --> 45:54.720
Captain Barbarossa with your buried secrets.

45:55.440 --> 46:00.160
Now maybe with $82 at 13, invest in some real estate.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.440
You're not going to be able to get much.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.440
That's the same as saving it.

46:03.440 --> 46:04.080
No, no, no.

46:04.080 --> 46:06.080
You buy, because here's the thing, Griffin.

46:06.080 --> 46:10.160
You buy $82 worth of real estate, by the time you're 21,

46:10.880 --> 46:15.360
that's like $82,000 worth of real estate in this economy.

46:15.360 --> 46:17.920
In this economy, yeah, which is either good or really bad, but.

46:18.560 --> 46:19.280
It's one of those.

46:19.920 --> 46:20.560
Justin.

46:20.560 --> 46:24.800
What if you're gonna, what if you, if I only had $83 in my pocket?

46:24.800 --> 46:25.280
You know what I mean?

46:25.280 --> 46:27.600
It's 82, so like that may ruin your idea.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.120
I found another dollar.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.000
Oh, good.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.680
Oh, you mugged someone?

46:32.640 --> 46:36.320
If I only had $82 in my pocket, you know where I'm gonna go.

46:37.760 --> 46:40.240
I'm gonna be looking for a come up.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.440
I'm gonna pop some tags.

46:42.080 --> 46:42.880
Oh, good.

46:42.880 --> 46:43.520
Oh, all right.

46:43.520 --> 46:44.800
Yeah, I'm going to the thrift shop.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.400
I'm gonna go in there.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.160
I got $82 in my pocket.

46:50.160 --> 46:55.200
I'm gonna buy some leopard mink that I should have washed.

46:55.200 --> 46:59.520
And I would just go to the thrift shop with my $82,

46:59.520 --> 47:01.600
and pop some tags, look for a come up.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.480
Okay.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.920
Yeah, it's fucking awesome.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.360
Velour jumpsuit, maybe.

47:05.920 --> 47:07.040
Some house slippers.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.240
A dookie brown leather jacket that I found digging.

47:14.080 --> 47:18.160
I think I would get 0.0001 bitcoins.

47:18.880 --> 47:19.840
Oh, that'd be good.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.560
KB Toys still around?

47:23.840 --> 47:25.440
They don't sell toys anymore.

47:25.440 --> 47:26.800
Nobody sells toys anymore.

47:26.800 --> 47:32.400
Did you guys go to any Toys R Uses before they closed?

47:33.120 --> 47:34.000
Yeah, I did.

47:34.000 --> 47:34.640
Sad, yeah?

47:35.280 --> 47:35.780
Yeah.

47:36.400 --> 47:37.840
This isn't funny.

47:37.840 --> 47:39.520
No, it's just bummed me out.

47:39.520 --> 47:40.400
I used to work there.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.520
$82.

47:43.520 --> 47:46.080
I never had $82 when I was 13.

47:46.080 --> 47:48.720
The first time I had $82 is after I had my first job

47:48.720 --> 47:52.400
at the country's best yogurt when I was 18 years old.

47:52.400 --> 47:56.480
And even then, I was making $2.50 an hour,

47:56.480 --> 47:59.760
or whatever the fuck minimum wage was back in 2005

48:00.400 --> 48:02.080
in Huntington, West Virginia.

48:02.080 --> 48:05.040
$82 is a princely sum.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.080
Are you kidding me?

48:06.080 --> 48:08.240
I would have gotten my own apartment when I was 13

48:08.240 --> 48:09.840
with $82 fucking dollars.

48:09.840 --> 48:11.520
Here's our idea if I was 13 and had $82.

48:12.720 --> 48:18.240
I would buy a clear bag and as many full-size candy bars

48:18.240 --> 48:19.760
as I could afford.

48:19.760 --> 48:21.040
Put them all in there.

48:21.680 --> 48:25.440
Then at Halloween, I would roll around with this bag

48:25.440 --> 48:27.920
and then direct people who asked me about my haul

48:27.920 --> 48:31.040
to different addresses in my neighborhood.

48:31.040 --> 48:35.040
And it would create a lot of confusion and a lot of chaos

48:35.040 --> 48:36.720
about where the cool houses were.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.960
And then I could just kind of like do my thing.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.880
And I would be out there because they'd be looking

48:40.880 --> 48:44.800
for these fake houses that I created with my fake haul.

48:45.360 --> 48:49.680
And just to finalize all the deets of the plan here, Justin,

48:49.680 --> 48:51.600
what would your thing be?

48:52.320 --> 48:54.640
What do you mean, what would my thing be?

48:54.640 --> 48:56.880
Justin Well, you're like, you would do your thing.

48:56.880 --> 48:57.680
What?

48:57.680 --> 48:59.680
Justin Okay.

48:59.680 --> 49:02.880
So I pick, I would make up a bunch of addresses.

49:02.880 --> 49:05.200
And so people would be like, where are they doing full-size?

49:05.200 --> 49:06.080
Justin No, no, no.

49:06.080 --> 49:06.480
I get that.

49:06.480 --> 49:06.960
I get that.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.160
Justin But then you said-

49:08.160 --> 49:09.280
Justin You gotta get yourself some 16 second

49:09.280 --> 49:10.960
more angel aim.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.920
Justin Right.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.880
That's their thing.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.720
As you have established, you would send them off

49:14.720 --> 49:15.600
to do their thing.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.400
And then you would just be out there doing your thing.

49:18.400 --> 49:21.680
So in this circumstance, my thing would be,

49:21.680 --> 49:25.280
I roll up at each house at about 825.

49:25.920 --> 49:28.560
And I'm like, listen, everybody's off looking

49:28.560 --> 49:29.920
for the good houses.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.840
You've got five minutes left.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.680
You don't want to leave that candy bowl line

49:33.680 --> 49:34.320
around your house.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.080
You're just going to scarf it this week.

49:36.080 --> 49:38.640
Hit me up and you'll be the only game in town

49:38.640 --> 49:39.760
so you can get all the candy.

49:39.760 --> 49:40.880
Justin That's good.

49:40.880 --> 49:41.440
Justin Okay.

49:41.440 --> 49:41.920
Justin That's good.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.680
Justin And then you light the black candle

49:43.680 --> 49:45.760
and you reawaken the Sanderson sisters.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.320
That would be my thing.

49:48.320 --> 49:48.800
Justin Yeah.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.640
Justin Establishing what our things would be.

49:50.640 --> 49:51.200
That would be my thing.

49:51.200 --> 49:51.440
Justin Yeah.

49:51.440 --> 49:52.880
I mean, that's fucked up because they killed

49:52.880 --> 49:54.000
a lot of people, Trevi.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.760
Justin Listen, I don't want to do it.

49:55.760 --> 49:56.480
Justin No, no, you said you wanted to do it.

49:56.480 --> 49:58.000
Justin I'm trying to impress that cool new girl.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.280
No, that would just be my thing.

49:59.280 --> 49:59.840
Justin Okay.

49:59.840 --> 50:01.520
Justin You know, because like, I'm trying to scare

50:01.520 --> 50:02.240
my little sister.

50:02.240 --> 50:02.720
Justin Sure.

50:02.720 --> 50:03.920
Justin And I'm trying to impress that girl

50:03.920 --> 50:05.520
that I just met because I moved into town.

50:05.520 --> 50:07.040
Justin No, I'm not saying there's reasons

50:07.040 --> 50:07.600
not to do it.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.520
I'm just saying they killed a lot of people, Trev.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.680
Justin Yeah, but then I would also stop them,

50:11.680 --> 50:12.080
Griffin.

50:12.080 --> 50:15.040
Justin You know what I'd do with $82 at 13?

50:15.040 --> 50:17.200
I would buy a bunch of marbles and a big coat.

50:17.200 --> 50:21.280
And I would fill the coat with the marbles and I would go to the principal's house and get inside

50:21.280 --> 50:21.920
of it somehow.

50:22.640 --> 50:25.280
And then I would open up the coat and let all the marbles fall out.

50:25.280 --> 50:25.760
Justin Nice.

50:25.760 --> 50:28.640
Justin Yeah, and then I'd tell them to, you know,

50:30.160 --> 50:31.600
you know, huff my nuts or something like that.

50:31.600 --> 50:35.280
And I'd get out of there because then the marbles are their problem.

50:35.280 --> 50:38.400
Justin I think I'd just go to Cracker Barrel and

50:38.400 --> 50:40.480
just buy a bunch of those talking parrots.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.440
Justin That's fun.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.840
And then you set them up at your principal's house and you'd be like,

50:43.840 --> 50:47.440
huff my nuts and then be like, huff my nuts and then be like, huff my nuts, huff my nuts,

50:47.440 --> 50:48.720
and then keep going forever and ever.

50:48.720 --> 50:49.680
I love that shit, dude.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.200
You ever seen a viral video like that?

50:51.200 --> 50:52.560
Justin I'd probably do that.

50:53.680 --> 50:55.920
Or I'd buy like a bunch of harmonicas just cuz.

50:56.560 --> 50:57.760
Put them in my steamer trunk.

50:57.760 --> 51:01.280
Justin I'd do Jawbreakers at Cracker Barrel and I would put those in my coat and empty

51:01.280 --> 51:03.840
them out of my principal's house because I really want them to slip and fall.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.880
I hate that fucking guy.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.560
Justin This has been our podcast, my brother, my brother, and me.

51:06.560 --> 51:07.920
Justin Where does he fucking get off, you know,

51:07.920 --> 51:08.880
send me to detention?

51:08.880 --> 51:10.400
Justin We hope you enjoyed it.

51:10.400 --> 51:14.320
Unless you're Principal Daniels, in which case you could huff Griffin's nuts, apparently.

51:14.320 --> 51:16.560
Justin I would've spent $82 to get Principal Daniels

51:16.560 --> 51:19.280
a tattoo that says huff my nuts against his will.

51:19.280 --> 51:22.960
Justin We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

51:22.960 --> 51:26.640
Thank you for indulging us with another hour of your precious life.

51:46.400 --> 51:48.320
I'm gonna recommend Bubble.

51:48.320 --> 51:51.840
It was a limited run sci-fi series, kind of like a

51:52.480 --> 51:57.360
Buffy with a hipster slant and we were on one episode as like craft beer fans.

51:57.360 --> 51:58.240
It was very good.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.520
So go listen to Bubble and I think you'll very much love it.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.920
Justin I'm gonna run through some quick plugs.

52:03.920 --> 52:07.040

It's also like buying your ticket or getting-

53:12.080 --> 53:13.280
You can do remote viewing.

53:13.280 --> 53:16.160
So even if you're not able to make it out to Seattle in January,

53:16.160 --> 53:17.760

53:17.760 --> 53:19.440
There's recordings of it that you can hear later.

53:19.440 --> 53:22.000
Remote viewing is the psychic thing, right?

53:22.000 --> 53:22.640
Yeah.

53:22.640 --> 53:24.480
I believe that's the psychic.

53:24.480 --> 53:25.680
Hey, if you want to do that.

53:34.480 --> 53:35.280
Because we'll know.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.320
We'll know, obviously.

53:36.320 --> 53:39.840
That's bit.ly slash McRoyPodCon the number two.

53:40.560 --> 53:43.280
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for these four theme songs.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.040
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.720
It's a super good album.

53:46.720 --> 53:48.480
John's a super good dude.

53:48.480 --> 53:50.560

53:56.320 --> 53:58.560
and Greatest Discovery, the Star Trek podcast.

53:58.560 --> 53:59.120
And it's great.

53:59.120 --> 54:04.560
It's like a thoughtful look at old war movies,

54:04.560 --> 54:09.280
where they talk about sort of the history of cinema about war

54:09.280 --> 54:14.160
and sort of geopolitical history and all kinds of stuff,

54:14.160 --> 54:15.920
a deep dive into those movies.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.280
It's called Friendly Fire.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.800
It's a super good show.
