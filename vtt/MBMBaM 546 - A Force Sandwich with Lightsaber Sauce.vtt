00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me and Advice Show for the modern era.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm your middle-est brother Travis, all bark, no bite, woof woof, mangy mongrel, dog pwned, McElroy.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Okay, I didn't know at what point in there you would be finished saying dog stuff.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
But this is Griffin McElroy, rawhide, flea and tick medicine, heartworm medicine.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Hey, can I ask you guys something?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I love it.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
I know Justin, Griffin, you guys are big, big financial bros.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
You guys are Wall Street mogul.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
I see a lot of people talking about the stocks.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Oh, and I'm so glad that we're bringing that here.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I don't notice a lot of people talk about bonds so much.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Bonds are done, bonds are over.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
They keep delaying it.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh, okay.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Stocks, though, are on the tip of everyone's tongues and lips.

01:40.000 --> 01:51.000
Finally, I think it's exciting that the national conversation has finally veered into our –

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
man, I say our weird – that's how I normally do it.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, you really hit that hard.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
Our area of sort of expertise.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
This is our wheel.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
We're in our wheelhouse, finally, Starks.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
I was hoping that you guys could take this opportunity,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
because I'm sure a lot of people are as confused as I am.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Sure.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Because you see a lot of talk about shorting and, I guess, longing, I guess.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Longing is the opposite, yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't know my elbow from my asshole,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
and so if you guys would tell me a little bit about it, that would be great.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Trav, I was talking to my close personal friend, Mad Money's Jim Cramer.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
We had a little play date for the kids the other day,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
and don't worry, they were wearing their special helmets.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
So that there was no risk of transmission,

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
and Mad Money's Jim Cramer knows where to get those helmets and the good ones, too.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And if you don't know what kind of helmets I'm talking about, don't worry about it.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
It's really only for a certain, let's say, salary level.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
But anyway, he explained it to me in this very helpful way,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
and he used GameStop as the example.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
And you know how when Crash Bandicoot 4 comes out,

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
and in order to get it, you trade in Crash Bandicoot 3 for it.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Right.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
But the value is depreciated.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah, you have to turn in Bandicoot 3 and 1 together to get 4.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
But even that, it's not exactly one-to-one,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
and that's something that Mr. Cramer, my good friend, had explained to me about it.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Okay.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
The differential between those two values is stocks.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
So the price difference between Crash Bandicoot 3 and Crash Bandicoot 4 is stocks?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
No! God!

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Okay.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
No!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Sorry.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Justin, can you help me? Can you tag in here?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I am sending jokes out of the room.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
I will explain what is happening with GameStop stocks in 30 seconds.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Are you ready?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Sure.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm so glad our show's going to stop being funny.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
No jokes.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
We're only three minutes in, though.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
It's a public service.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
But do some jokes.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I had a whole thing about Jim Cramer, my friend.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
No jokes.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Hey, can we do 30 seconds of jokes,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
and then pretend like you didn't do 30 seconds of jokes,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
and go back to making jokes about it?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I put in an effort to explain it good, but I also did jokes.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
So I don't see why you get to only do one of those.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I will make three.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Can you use silly words?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Shut up.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I'll make three discrete fart noises.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Thank you.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
During my explanation.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Oh, they better get good, too.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Are you ready?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, they better be good, though.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
All right.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
It's an intro.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Don't start with one.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
That one doesn't count.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
You've got to do three more.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Internal.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Okay.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
In addition to buying stocks, when you buy a stock, it says,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I think this stock's going to increase in value.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
It's short stocks, which is where you borrow some stocks and say,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I think this is going to go down in value,

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
and I'll be able to sell it for less than it is right now.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
A lot of people did that with GameStop, because it's a bad business.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Gasping.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Oh, I was gasping for a rip, wasn't I?

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
A lot of hedge fund nerds did that with GameStop.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
A bunch of people on Reddit said, actually,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
what if we all buy GameStop at the same time?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
That'll really fuck those dudes up.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
And then they all did it at the same time,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
and it fucked those dudes up,

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
because they were expecting the stock to go down,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
but because everybody on Reddit bought it at the same time,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
the stock price went up, so now they're mad,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
and the people on Reddit have money.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
I will credit you one fart noise, Justin,

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
because hedge fund managers losing everything is way funnier

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
than any joke that we're going to be able to do on this show today.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Very funny.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Now, that's the entire explanation.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Here's what I don't know.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Does this affect me in a negative way?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Right, or a positive way.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
No, it does affect me in a positive way,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
because it's extremely funny.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
It's super funny.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
It's so funny.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
But it might be less funny if I knew if it affected me in some way.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
That I don't know.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I bought stocks in Cheez-Its.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Is that affected by this?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Specifically, the food product, I went to the store.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I said, give me 100 boxes of Cheez-Its.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I'm ready to sell them back when they increase in value.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Is that affected by this?

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
It depends, Travis, on if Cheez-Its were part of these modern-day Robin Hoods

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
over on Reddit, by which I mean, by all accounts,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
just really kind of shitty people still.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
Were they trying to Roger the big man by buying up Cheez-It stock

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
when everybody thinks Cheez-It's going to fail?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Now, I don't think anybody would think Cheez-It's going to fail.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Too crunchy to fail.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Too zesty to zesty.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So you're telling me these boxes of Cheez-Its are worthless?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Not sort of taste-wise.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh, they're all open.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I've been eating out of them.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Maybe to bread some chicken.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Now we're talking.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, but I feel like that's a loss.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I feel like at that point, I'm only getting 75% return on my Cheez-It stock.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
My favorite part of this whole saga so far has been that the trading apps

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
have shut down GameStop trading, which is, you know, illegal.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
And AOC was out there like, this is illegal, and we are going to fuck you up.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And then Ted Cruz, famous pants pisser, comes in and is like,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
that's right, AOC, get him.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
And then AOC was like, shut the fuck up, Ted Cruz.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Shut the fuck up, Ted.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
You're ruining it for everybody, Ted.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You don't get to be on this side of it.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
You get to be on the wrong side forever, Ted, you fucking dipshit.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Hey, AOC, if you're listening, you're welcome to come on the show anytime.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Please come on our fucking show.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And I will say, I'm going to go ahead and lay it out.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Ted Cruz is not welcome at any time.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Ted Cruz is not welcome on this show.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Unless he wants to do 420 with us.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
And unless we can put down some plastic sheets on the chairs.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So this is an advice show.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
By the way, I know less now than I did when we started about what happened.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
So thank you.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
You did such a good job.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
You just casually threw out the words,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
somebody borrowed stock to sell it when it was worth less,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
and now they're mad.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
What does that fucking mean?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Who did they borrow it from?

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
When you short a stock, you're betting that it's going to drop in value, right?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Because you borrow it at a certain price, right?

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And then when you buy it, you're saying, I'm going to buy this later.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
That's basically what you're saying.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And the differential between the price that you eventually buy it at,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
and the price that you borrowed it at, is shorting it.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
And that says, this place is going down.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Now some people do that, and then they're like,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm going to join the board and fuck this place up.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm going to short this stock by going in and shorting it myself,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
which does not seem very good.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
But it does seem like a good plan.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I see it's effective.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
It would be like me saying that, betting that Paul Blart 3 is going to be bad,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
and then being hired as the director of Paul Blart 3,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
and pushing one of the cameras into the swimming pool full of macaroni and cheese,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
which is a major set piece of the film.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I've ruined the movie myself.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
And that was a belabored metaphor, but you get the idea.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
You guys know what would be so funny?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
What's that?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
If anyone from Reddit is listening, it would be so funny.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I heard all these hedge fund bros,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
and they were going to short sell my brother, my brother and me.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Can you imagine if you guys really drove our stock up,

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
and made us super famous and really cool dudes?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, maybe wait until after our Ippo,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
which is how Jim Cramer taught me to say IPO.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
We got an Ippo.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
We have to Ippo.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
We got an Ippo.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
We have to become publicly traded.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Jim Cramer's got a character he calls the Ippo Hippo,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
and he comes on whenever...

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Guys, the Ippo Hippo's coming into the studio.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
The Ippo Hippo's rolling into the studio.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
He says, this is a great Ippo.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I know a lot of people don't care for Jim Cramer,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
but he's a chill bro who has the good kush,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
and he knows where to get the good helmets for the children,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
so we love him around here.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Unless there is a reason that we should love Jim Cramer

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
that we're just not aware of.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
He's got the good kush.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
He's a chill bro who with a good hang and great kush

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and cool helmets for the kids.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
And has never done anything wrong.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I want to start saying that more often.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Just laying it out.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
They've never done anything wrong.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Blanket acceptance.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I swear to God, if you are about to tweet at us,

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
actually, here's a thing that Jim Cramer did wrong,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
we probably could have guessed it.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, you can just tweet that at Ted Cruz.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, or Jim Cramer.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Or Jim Cramer.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Hey, Jim.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Just wanted to remind you about this thing you did.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Jim Cramer's the one fucked up, probably.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
We've all fucked up, haven't we?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Except some people worse than others.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Not like that thing Jim Cramer may or may not have done.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I didn't like it when Jim Cramer was doing the stand-up,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
and he got so racist.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Remember that?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah, I remember that.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Remember when Jim Cramer did that?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
These are the words.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Do you guys ever think about how Michael Richards did go off

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
and be big racist, big racist,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
and say the most racist words on his stage,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
and everybody started booing at him?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
And you could tell he ran some quick calculus in his head

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
about what he should say immediately after,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
and what he came up with was,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
these are the words.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh, Michael, that wasn't it, partner.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
It should have been, the words that follow that is,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
well, I'll be going now, forever.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I'll be on the moon.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Don't worry about me, Michael Richards.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm heading out.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Bye, everybody.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
I'm departing the universal consciousness.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Goodbye.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Does anybody know where the nearest tar pit is?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Because I'm just going to stroll right in.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
It's me, Cosmo Cramer.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
This is an advice show, as you certainly guessed at this point.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
And we are here to help.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
You know what's funny, guy?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
I feel like this is a weird show

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
because this is the first one we've recorded

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
since the release of our book about podcasting.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Everybody has a podcast except you.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
And I kind of feel like this is the time to rest on our laurels.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
There's no point in improving anymore.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Yes, thank you.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I was going to say the same thing.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah, it's like victory lap time.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
At this point, the bad part is people, anytime we make any errors,

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
people could be like, well, you wrote the book on podcasting.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
So that is something that has only recently occurred to me.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
But it's also good because it's like, hey, I wrote the book on podcasting.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
This must be the right way to do it.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
That's not an error.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
That's not an error.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
When we said for sure that Jim Cramer has never done anything wrong,

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
that wasn't an error.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I did the book on podcasting.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Although if we do fuck up, we can be like,

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
yes, we did write the book on podcasting, but I didn't write that one part.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Justin did that one part.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
That was a ghostwriter, by which I mean the ghostwriter of television fame.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Oh, fuck, we should have put that on the cover,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
that ghostwriter helped us write it.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
We just put a bunch of letters down and we said,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
ghostwriter, here's some letters.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And we threw the letters up in the air or whatever,

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
and he arranged them into words about podcasting.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Can I please, please, please.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I wish you would, coward.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
I recently moved into an apartment building next to an Arby's.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Nice.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
I love to eat at Arby's.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
That's the end of the question.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
This is written from everyone.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I love to eat at Arby's, but because of everything going on,

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
they don't allow walk-ins and you can't walk up to a drive-through and order.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
However, last month I saw someone bike through the drive-through, no problem.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I don't have a bike,

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
and I don't want to drive my car through the busy road in front of both businesses

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
just for a craving.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
What's the smallest mode of transportation you think they will allow?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
That's from Meat Seeking Mistland, Michigan.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Okay, this is actually finally one we can really sink our teeth in.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah, until I read this question, it had not occurred to me

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
how silly one would feel if they lived next to,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
directly next to a drive-through.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Are you going to get into your car, pull out of your parking space,

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
drive around, drive farther than you would walk,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
and then go back and park in view of the drive-through window

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
and say, like, thanks again, Doug, as you go into your house?

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
What about door dashing it and just as they're leaving the drive-through,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
just yell out your window, like, hey, chuck it up.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'll meet you halfway.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Chuck it up.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Hey, listen, I made a little rascal-style basket on a rope.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Chuck it up.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
You have to twist those pedals around to raise it up.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
It's a pulley system.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
First of all, it feels like we've been talking about nothing but fast food

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
for the last four episodes in a row, and that's a weird confluence of events,

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
but there's no Arby's Law.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
There's Arby's best practices.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
When you start an open Arby's franchise, you probably are sent a binder,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
and that binder is like, here's good ways to do Arby's,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
and please do them this way so that there's some Arby's consistency.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
I can pretty much guarantee you, though, that people working at this Arby's

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
would be willing to work out some sort of walk-through arrangement with you.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
There has to be some Arby's Law, Griffin.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
You can't just say blanket statement that everything in Arby's is a suggestion.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
No, it's not a suggestion.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Again, there's best practices, but I'm saying if you work at—

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I had clients, as I referred to them at the TCBY,

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
who I would mix some of the scoopable ice cream into the milkshakes

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
when you were supposed to just use the soft serve,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
or I would blend soft serve and scoopable ice cream,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
which you're probably not supposed to do,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
and I probably cost TCBY hundreds of thousands of dollars,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
but those are my clients.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Those are my people.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Who am I without my clients?

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
But, Griffin, you can't assume that every fast food employee

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
is a free thinker like you are, right?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
So the risk is that you walk up and you're like,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
it's cool, I had an arrangement with Jerry,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
and they're like, Jerry's not here today.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
I'm Diane, and I follow the rules.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
And now you're just out a sandwich.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
You've got to find the Patch Adams of that Arby's,

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
who doesn't play by the rules, but respects the client

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
and loves the client, and the client's never wrong.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
You know, I had a friend, Jason Daniel Aldridge,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
used to work at Arby's.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
I didn't know that.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Yeah, when you work at Arby's, there's a huge loaf of meat

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
that they're slicing, the slices of roast beef,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
the titular Arby off of.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
You have to wear a chainmail glove when you're doing it,

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
and he stole one.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
It's so cool.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Chainmail Arby's glove.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
That's fucking radical.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Not radical.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You'd probably fight a snake with that.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
No problem.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Not an issue.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Especially if it's made of roast beef.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Do you think you could get away with Healy's?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Arby's?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Oh, you mean rolling through?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Mm-hmm.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Okay, I'm just going to gut check this.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Okay.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Healy's, no.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Pogo stick, no.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Right?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Skateboard?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It has to contain you in some ways.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Bicycle doesn't contain you.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
It's true.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Motorcycle, they wouldn't turn away a motorcycle.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
Segway is maybe about as far as I think they would be.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
A bicycle is honestly the lowest.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I think a Razor scooter, maybe?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Razor scooter.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Yeah, maybe a Razor.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
What about a box car racer?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Oh, maybe.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
You just finished the big race with your Boy Scout troop,

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
and it happens to end at the bottom of the hill as an Arby's,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
and you just coast through the driveway.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
I know.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
They're trying to wait for a car to be in the drive-through,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
and when they pull up to the sign, run up and hop into that car.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
No problem.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
And say, hey, what's up?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
My name's Tyson.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Hey, don't freak out.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Hey, hey.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Put your phone down.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Put your phone down.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
This can go one of two ways.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
This is a gun, but it's unrelated.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
This can go one of two ways.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Either you help me out, or I will leave,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
and I will wait for another car, and I will see if they're cooler.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
But I'm hungry for roast beef sandwiches.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Do you want a Yahoo?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Yes, please.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yes, please.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
This one was sent in by several people.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I'm going to call them.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
Tyson asks, if you could travel to Mars,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
who would you travel with and what's next?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Oh, that's tough, man.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
If you travel to Mars, how long does it take?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
What do you guys think?

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
Are we staying at Mars, or is it just like a drive-by like, ooh, Mars?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
To Mars.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I'm seeing how long it takes to get to Mars.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Around seven months.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Thirty seconds.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Well, okay.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
No, that was a good one.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
That was good.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
It took me a minute to run it in my head.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Like, why does that sound familiar?

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
And then I remembered about Mr. Leto and his great music,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
and then I was like, oh, that's it.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
But it would take about six to eight months,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
which is longer than astronauts currently stay

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
on the International Space Station.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
So there would be like, you know, return trip if you want to come back,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
but let's round it up to two years.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
We're talking about bone density loss.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
And if we're going to do that, I want a fucking road dog up there,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
by which I mean, I guess, a space dog.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
I think, yeah, I think space dog would be the way to go.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
Can you imagine a dog trying to get around floating in the air?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
That's adorable.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Kicking their little legs.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Oh, that's a good boy.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Fucking Elon.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I'll tell you why.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Okay.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
They have to come get him.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
They have to come get him is the first one.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
If he wants them to come get him, they have to.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
Second one, the ship crashed into Mars, explodes like it did in Martian.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
I wouldn't be out there eating my dookie potatoes like that idiot.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Elon Musk.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Matt Damon, no.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
I would say, Elon, how's the new spaceship coming?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
That you're making out of Mars rocks.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
And he would make me a new one out of Mars rocks.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
And the other thing is when I get back from Mars with or without Elon,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
maybe I steal the rock ship.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Maybe not.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
And maybe you travel with him in your tummy.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
When I come back, I'm not going to fucking eat Elon.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Can you chill?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
I'm just saying that if it comes down to it, why wouldn't you eat Elon Musk?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
He'll eat you if you don't eat him.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
When I come back, I will receive a stipend paying me for the time

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
that everybody else got away from Elon Musk.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
And I'm thinking I could probably scrounge up a couple of milli

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
for that service that I would provide.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
And I will have gone on a pretty bodacious spaceship adventure.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
So I think mine's the best one.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Here's what I'm going to hit you with.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
How about this, Dolly Parton?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Here's my logic.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Okay.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
All right.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Dolly Parton, one, incredible career.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah, story.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Incredible career.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
And is going to have so many great stories, right?

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
Stories about Porter, stories about Kenny, stories about everybody.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
You know what I mean?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Just even growing up.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Growing up in rural someplace.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
You know what I mean?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Like great stories.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And that's going to be great.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
And when the talking, when the sort of conversational fuel happens

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
on every long trip, and I certainly would think in a space travel scenario,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
she could sing maybe a beautiful song.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And maybe we can duet.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
You know what I mean?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Maybe it's me and Dolly.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Islands in the stream.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
That is what we are.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Islands up in space.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Better than a car.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
This is not a car.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It's a spaceship.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
And we rely on each other.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Because we're in space together.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
And here's the other part.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
And here's two more things about bringing Dolly Parton into space.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
One of them is she's led a great life and helped a lot of people,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
and I think she deserves it.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I think she deserves to get up there, get the distance,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
and look down and say, look at it, Dolly.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
You made that beautiful blue globe a little bit better.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
A little bit bluer.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
The last thing I would say about it is that she is pretty old.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
So if it got kind of boring, you know what I mean?

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
Like eventually if it got kind of boring, it would probably be okay soon.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
You know what I mean?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Like it would probably be better.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
If I got sick of Dolly Parton, it would probably be different.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Than when she was alive.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Hey Justin, would you kill Dolly Parton?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
What are you saying?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
I wouldn't kill Dolly Parton.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
I'm saying that she's an older lady and I love her.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I wish her the longest possible life.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
But if we're up in space and I'm like, I'm really getting sick of Dolly Parton.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
You would start wishing for her death.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
I wouldn't wish for her death.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
But I would say nature don't take a space holiday is one thing that I've heard.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Nature is still doing it up in space.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
You don't know that.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
Well, she's not going to be able to get the special nutrition for older people that she needs up in space.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
We're going to be living off of, you know, our dookie potatoes and the little packets of hard ice cream and all that.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
So she's not going to get the calcium that she needs up there.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
And I'm just saying that like it's not going to be, I don't know, exercise situation or whatever.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
But like, I'm saying it, I'm not going to be stuck with Dolly Parton for 20 years on Mars.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
No, I mean, up to this point, I think, Justin, Griffin and I have been thinking about it in terms of two years.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
But you're thinking about if we get stuck.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
We're coming home. You want to stay there, I guess.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Now, Justin, I would be remiss if I didn't also ask.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm not saying I want to get stuck there.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
We know.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
In much the same way, I'm not saying I want Dolly Parton to die.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
But I'm saying if I do get stuck there.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Uh-huh.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
I don't even think you know what you're saying at this point.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I think I know what I'm saying.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Hey, Griffin, I think I know what he's saying.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
I just don't know that I'm comfortable with the fact that he's saying it.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Yeah.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
So I want to shift to a more comfortable topic and ask Justin, in the event that it becomes necessary,

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
how do you feel about consuming the flesh of Dolly Parton for sustenance?

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
And then I'm going to pivot even further away from that, Travis, and I'm so glad.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Oh, he was about to answer though, Griffin.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, I know.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
I have to know.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
I think I would actually do, I think I do think I would actually take Matt Damon.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
And the whole time I would be very confrontational.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Like you're always talking, hey, what's up, Goodwill?

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
You're always talking shit about how you're going to do it up on Mars.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Well, let's fucking see, bro.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Yeah.

24:41.000 --> 24:49.000
And he'd be like, sir, I have never said it's me, Matt Damon, the real Martian,

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
who would get up there and make some real dookie potatoes and I could live on Mars and I'm the best.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I've never said that.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Those are words that you're putting in my mouth.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Yeah, right.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Yeah, right, Goodwill.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Shit on the ground, dawg.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
You also run the risk though, Griffin, of getting Matt Damon and Interstellar, who is a piece of shit himself.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And that is, I would not want to travel with Interstellar.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Now, if I could travel with the robot from Interstellar, forget about it.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Robot, how's the way to go?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Is Matt Damon an Interstellar?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
He is.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Yeah, he's a real stinker in that flow.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Really?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Yeah.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I don't remember that.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Oh, I'd travel with McConaughey.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
I think he'd probably sleep most of the time.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh, yeah, baby, changing my answer.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Yeah.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Mr. Smooth himself.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
And I bet his skin tastes like jerky.

25:32.000 --> 25:39.000
Huntington, West Virginia's own Matthew McConaughey would be an excellent travel companion to Mars, except it would get, wouldn't it get a little old?

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
It would get a little sensual, I would say.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
And there's no way I'm outliving Matthew McConaughey 100%.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
Even the sensuality, Travis, would also get old after a bit.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah, you'd start to chafe, for sure.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
I don't think that he would take, I don't think that you would be pounding it with Matt.

25:57.000 --> 26:05.000
Okay, you don't think if Matthew McConaughey and I were together, crashed on, this is long term, this isn't just two years, this is like 20 years.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
You don't think maybe just two?

26:08.000 --> 26:14.000
The question was, if you could travel to Mars and eat snacks, what would it be?

26:14.000 --> 26:23.000
And Justin's answer was, I would kill and eat Dolly Parton, and Travis's is, I think I would have a 20-year-long sexual arrangement with Matthew McConaughey in outer space.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Or a 20-year-long seduction.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Oh, lol, lol, Elon and combos.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
And let me be clear, it would be, well, I was going to say it wouldn't be romantic, but I don't know that.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
But I think, as far as I know, Matthew McConaughey and I are both straight fellas.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.000
But I don't think that that would get in the way of just the sheer companionship and joy of human contact that we would experience being together.

26:45.000 --> 26:52.000
But that wasn't even, the question is, what's a celebrity you like and what's a food you like?

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
And Justin's like, I want to carve Martin Sheen's skull into a fucking bowl.

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
Yeah, and I would say Matthew McConaughey and chocolate sauce, that we might eat off each other if it comes to that.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
And at this point, let me just be clear, it's the sensuality, really.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
It's just giving us something to focus our minds on other than the desolate wasteland of Mars.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
And it reestablishes that we're together, and also chocolate tastes delicious, and look at that six pack.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
I love it.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Hey, quick question.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Given the recent quarantine, my pajama game has significantly improved.

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
I now sport three to four different pairs that I can casually wear on the apartment, go unnoticed on work Zoom calls.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
They're so comfortable.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Nice.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
The thing is, I do need to leave the apartment building sometimes to grab groceries or run a short errand.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
My girlfriend thinks it's weird that I don't change into normal clothes to do this.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
What do you think?

27:44.000 --> 27:51.000
Can I wear my fancy PJs outside the house for short, local, no driving adventures to the outside world? And that's from Stefan.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
How fancy.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.000
My one-man production of the pajama game is also doing very well in quarantine.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
There's been a lot of things that I've had to solve for.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
A lot of like, how do you do Bob Fosse by yourself?

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
And I've come up with a lot of answers to those things.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Everything here isn't alive and well in Austin, Texas.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
In my heart.

28:16.000 --> 28:28.000
I think, okay, I'm trying to think of what is the complication, the difference betwixt pajama clothing and what one might consider outdoor clothing, outside clothing.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Correct.

28:29.000 --> 28:36.000
And it seems to me like the first thing that clicked in my head is kind of like density, thickness of material.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
You know what I mean?

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I think that could be solved for though with a heavy flannel pajama.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Yeah.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
It's gonna look like fucking Kevin McAllister.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah, I'll go to buy a toothbrush.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
It's gonna be, it's gonna, this is so subjective.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
I don't think there's one answer to this.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
This is fashion, isn't it?

28:55.000 --> 29:04.000
I can't, I don't feel comfortable wearing pajamas outdoors, even though that is what I am wearing right now at 2.04 PM central time.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
I got my PJ pants on.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Because I haven't left the house.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
Little Totino's branded pants.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
But if I did leave the house, I would put on jeans is what I'm saying.

29:15.000 --> 29:22.000
But that's just, that's me because I don't think I look good right now and I don't feel confident enough to do it.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
But I mean, you know, go on any college campus, everybody's wearing jammers.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Yeah, I mean, you're not gonna get arrested for wearing pajamas.

29:29.000 --> 29:40.000
I just feel like, personally, I just feel like what this quarantine has taught us, it's probably lots of things.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
So one of them is every trip outside is a gift.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
You know, I took it for granted in much the same way that anybody else does.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Now when I go outside, I take a little time for me.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
You know what I mean?

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I want to make it feel special.

29:52.000 --> 30:03.000
And I feel like even if you aren't into that, the least you could do is like gussy up for other people that are making like their big special trip outside.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Because it'll be a rarity for them too.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
You want them to see beautiful people, beautiful fashion, people trying their hardest.

30:08.000 --> 30:15.000
You know, and I think that that, I think it's nice to put in a little, put on the ritz a little bit.

30:15.000 --> 30:23.000
Now Joseph, I hear you say that, but that assumes that these fancy jammies are any more fancy than like jeans and a shirt.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
No, but you know, don't you?

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
I mean, the thing about it is, I don't know how to define pajamas, but I know them when I see them.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
And you know, don't you?

30:32.000 --> 30:39.000
And no matter how the fabric, the material, there's eventually going to be a flap that makes bathroom easier somewhere on them.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
You know what I mean?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
You know, you know.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
There are probably fashion jammies that are not practical jammies that you could wear,

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
but they're clearly not, they're jammies one might wear to some kind of highfalutin society pajama party,

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
but not actual jammies that you're slipping into for a long winter's nap.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
You know?

30:59.000 --> 31:06.000
Like when we get invited up to the Playboy Mansion for their annual pajama party, like the jammies that we wear.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
You know what I mean?

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Those ones, those are not pajamas I would actually wear to bed.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
The jammies that I wear to swim in the grotto, those are not the same jammies I slip into bed.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
You know what I mean?

31:17.000 --> 31:26.000
They're jammies that are reinforced in the elbows and knees and the back for protection from weapons.

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
Yeah, you do always have a sort of shield back there, a natural shield.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
It's important, right?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
All my clothes have that, that's the thing.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
But I don't do that when I go to, oh God, I've just admitted my one weakness.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
Now people are going to attack me in bed when my jammies aren't reinforced.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Damn it.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
That's how you're going to go, isn't it?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Yep.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It's good that you know that.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Yeah, nude, nude, totally nude.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
That's how I'm sleeping.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Did you guys ask that?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
I did.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Okay.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
You read my book.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
The name of the book was What's Justin Even Doing in There by Griffin McElroy.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
It came out on the same day as our podcast book, that's why nobody's really talking about it.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
It's actually published within our podcast book, if you read every third word,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
that's Griffin's book about what's Justin doing in there.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
That's my book, What's Justin Even Doing in There.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Hey, can we go to the Money Zone?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I'd love that.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
We've earned it, right?

32:20.000 --> 32:40.000
Yeah, please.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Hey, everybody.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
It's me, regular human being here to talk about the Money Zone.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
Just a regular human being in my human body, and I'm going to tell you about Squarespace,

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
the website that all of us humans are using to build beautiful websites to showcase our human work,

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
to sell human products, human services, and human stuff of all kinds,

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
and to promote our human physical or human online businesses.

33:08.000 --> 33:15.000
Well, I think we humans can all agree that beautiful, customizable templates are important to us humans,

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
and everything is optimized right out of the box for those mobile things us humans are using all the time.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
This is so much better, Trav.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
You're getting so much better.

Good.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
And don't worry, human friends.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Fuck!

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
You were on the finish line.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Fuck!

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Can you edit?

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Let's get it.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
We'll have it edited out.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Okay, and I'm Beep Blorp!

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Fuck!

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
Stamps.com.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Let's ask the listener, I guess, what do you already know about Stamps.com?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Pause.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Pause.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Pause.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Wrong!

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Well, then we don't need to even do the ad.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
What's the next question?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
We should still do the ad.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
We should still do the ad.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Listen, nobody wants to spend all their time going to the freaking post office.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
They want to spend their time going to, you know, Chuck E. Cheese, Dave and Buster's,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
like fun places with cool arcade games.

34:34.000 --> 34:40.000
Well, save time to go to Dave and Buster's by going first to Stamps.com,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
which allows you to mail and ship anytime, anywhere right from your computer.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
You can send letters, ship packages, and pay a lot less with discounted rates

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
from the USPS, UPS, and more letters.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Do you think that there have been any, like, postmaster generals

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
who have thought about, like, putting some arcade games in there?

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Just like, even like just one pinball machine, really,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
or like one of those tabletop, like, Ms. Pac-Bands?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
I think it would be a game changer.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah, that'd be sick, man.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
And hey, while we're at it, let's just sell pizza at the post office.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Right?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
You know what I mean?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Yeah.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
And maybe a ball pit for the kids.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Whether you're a small office sending out invoices.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Just make a ball pit out of, like, abandoned mail that the kids can swim around in.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Yeah, that could be fun.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
If you're a small office sending out invoices or an online seller shipping out orders

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
or a big, big warehouse sending out thousands of packages a day,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Stamps.com handles all that with ease.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
It's not even a problem.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
You can get discounts up to 40% off post office rates

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
and up to 62% off UPS shipping rates.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
It saves you time and money, and hey,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
nearly one million small businesses already use Stamps.com,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
so join the freaking wave.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Stop wasting time going to the post office and go to Stamps.com instead.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
There's no risk.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000

That's Stamps.com, promo code MYBROTHER.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Stamps.com, never go to the post office again.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Hey there, beautiful people.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Did you hear that good, good news?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Something about the baby Jesus?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Mmm, he's coming back.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
Or do you mean the fact that Apple Podcast has named Fanta

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
one of the best shows of 2020?

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
I mean, we already knew that we was hot stuff,

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
but a little external validation never hurts, okay?

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Hosted by me, writer and journalist Jared Hill.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
And me, the ebony entrantress myself.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
JaVelle Anderson.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
Fanta is your home for complex conversations about the great areas in our lives,

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
the people, places, and things we're huge fans of but got some anti-feelings toward.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
You name it, we Fanta-ing. Nobody's off limits.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Check us out every Thursday on MaximumFun.org

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
or wherever you get your Slayworthy audio.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Dun dun!

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
That's supposed to be like the Law and Order sound.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
So pretend that, pretend that, okay?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
All right.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Dun dun!

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Dun dun dun dun dun.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Dun dun!

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Dun dun dun dun dun.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Dun dun dun dun dun.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
Dun dun dun dun dun.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Welcome to Law and Order Munch Squad,

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
podcast within a podcast, profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
as it relates to the legal profession.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
We've already explained finance, and now we're going to get into some legal,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
some legal metals here on the Munch Squad.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
This is a brief Munch Squad, and I just want to-

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
It's a legal brief.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
This is a brief Munch Squad, and I just wanted to talk about it.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Have you guys heard about Subway's tuna?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Huh?

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
That is a delicious creamy treat on a nice hot day.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Yeah, what a troubling question.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
I want to say that I am not lending any credence to this story.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I'm not detracting any credence from this story.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I'm reporting this story as a journalist.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
Who is not a journalist, but an entertainer is what I meant to say.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
This is for entertainment only.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
So there is a Washington Post story about a new lawsuit in California,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
and there's a lawsuit against Subway.

38:15.000 --> 38:21.000
Subway has tuna, and Subway's menu says that the tuna is flaked tuna

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
blended with creamy mayo, then topped with your choice of crisp, fresh veggies.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Sure, sure.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Okay, so according to this Washington Post report,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
the ingredient billed as, quote,

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
tuna for the chain sandwiches and wraps contains absolutely no tuna.

38:37.000 --> 38:44.000
In fact, according to the lawsuit, it is, quote, made from anything but tuna.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Now, hold on.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Hold on.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
Based on an independent lab test that revealed the so-called tuna is,

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
instead, a mixture of various concoctions that do not constitute tuna,

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
An attorney for the plaintiffs, however, declined to specify what it is.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
That's not important.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
Well, only what it is not, which, again, is tuna.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Thank you to Grub Street, by the way.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
I'm reading the Grub Street report because Washington Post had a paywall

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
on this important journalism.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
This is, I would argue, quite important journalism.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
If there are people out there thinking,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
I could go for a tuna sandwich from Subway today.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
This is maybe the most important journalism that has ever existed for those people.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
It can't be anything but tuna.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Yeah.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
There must be a line drawn somewhere.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
I mean, we're all made out of stardust, aren't we?

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
So, technically, there's a little bit of tuna everywhere.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
In all of us, every breath you take, there's, like, a little bit of tuna.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Like a Julius Caesar's tuna club that he had.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
A Julius Caesar tuna burp.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
At least one molecule of that.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
It's got tuna flavor, right?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
So, it's got to have some sort of-

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
Driven everything but tuna would imply that if there is flavor there,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
it is artificial tuna at best.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
But that's still tuna.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
You know what I mean?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
If it tastes-

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
People have been eating this for a very long time now,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
and in great quantities.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
And the fact that nobody's ever taken a bite out of it and been like,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
this isn't fucking tuna,

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
makes me think that there's probably some tuna in there.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
Or if not, is a close enough sort of simulation of tuna,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
that would rip no skin off my nose, baby.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
There's also, though, I like that there's this possible history

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
in which somebody, like, handed somebody this at Subway HQ,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
and they said, what is it?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
And they're like, well, take a bite of it and you tell me.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
And they take a bite and they're like, well, this is tuna.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
And I'm like, okay.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
Yeah, I couldn't tell you before in case you didn't think it was tuna.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
Wait, why wouldn't you tell me it's tuna?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
It's tuna, right?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Well, do you think it's tuna?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Yes.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That's all that matters, baby.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Great.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
No, but do tell me, is it tuna?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Well, what do you think?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
No, I think it's tuna, but is it?

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Well-

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
The important thing is, what do you think?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
The important thing is, you think it's tuna.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Tuna is in the mouth of the beater.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Hey, hey, Doug, you're fired.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
No, that makes sense.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah, I get it.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
I get that, but do still sell this though, okay?

41:25.000 --> 41:31.000
Not because I made a deal with a dark god to make sure as many people consumed their flesh as possible.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
What's that, Doug?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Don't worry about it.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Nothing, nothing.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
You guys want to know what Subway says?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Yeah.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
There is simply no truth to the allegations in the complaint that was filed in California.

41:43.000 --> 41:51.000
Subway delivers 100% cooked tuna to his restaurants, which is mixed with mayonnaise and used in freshly made sandwiches,

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
wraps and salads that are served to and enjoyed by our guests.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
The taste and quality of our tuna make it one of Subway's most popular products.

42:01.000 --> 42:14.000
And these baseless accusations threaten to damage our franchisees, small business owners who work tirelessly to uphold the high standards that Subway sets for all of its products, including its tuna.

42:14.000 --> 42:22.000
Given the facts, the lawsuit constitutes a reckless and improper attack on Subway's brand and goodwill.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:40.000
Subway will vigorously defend itself against these and any other baseless efforts to mischaracterize and tarnish the high quality products that Subway and its franchisees provide their customers in California and around the world.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
Subway intends to fight these claims through all available avenues if they are not immediately dismissed.

42:45.000 --> 42:54.000
Now, okay, if I may, that is a very long and forceful rebuttal of the charges, correct?

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Yeah.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
I think we can all agree on that.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
I was stirred.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
My soul was stirred.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Right.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
We all feel very confident about that.

43:02.000 --> 43:08.000
It's a really long way of saying, no, it's tuna, though, right?

43:08.000 --> 43:16.000
I mean, if it's just tuna, it seems like my statement as Subway would be, no, it's tuna.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Just check.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
It's definitely tuna.

43:19.000 --> 43:27.000
But it's, like, so full-throated, I don't know who they need to sway to convince that it's definitely tuna.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Now, okay, to be fair, Justin-

43:29.000 --> 43:35.000
Just have one piece of printed out paper and someone's holding it and they're a scientist.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
It says, the facts are in.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
And as you can read in this printout, it says here, it's tuna.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
But imagine if you're Subway Justin and you have had to more than-

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Subway Justin.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Subway Justin.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
One of my great characters.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
And you have more than once had to respond, no, it's tuna.

43:53.000 --> 44:03.000
And think about how on, like, the fifth time you've had to say that out loud, you might just break and write, like, a five-page long statement, right?

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Like, it's fucking tuna.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
What's going on?

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
The exact to which it is tuna cannot be overstated.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
This is tuna, baby.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
On a scale from zero to tuna, it's tuna.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
Now, it's so wild, though, because there's one of two options.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
One, it ain't tuna, which is wild, right?

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
Or somebody was eating it and they're like, this ain't tuna.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I want to sue them.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
We're going to court.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
I'm doing a lab test.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
I want to invent a lab.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
I want to find a shady lab that'll say this isn't tuna.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
So I can get a-

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
This is Bob's lab.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Thank you so much for dropping this up.

44:44.000 --> 44:49.000
I did lose the sample, but I tested something else and it wasn't tuna.

44:49.000 --> 44:57.000
So assuming this isn't settled, which, I mean, in my layman's brain here, looks like Subway ain't giving a fucking inch on this one.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
No.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
We're not going to write a $100,000 check to these people that say they ain't tuna because it's tuna.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
This is going to go before a judge.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
And I feel like the judge is going to get a couple of days in the proceedings before he's like, okay, everybody, just level with me.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Is this tuna?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Is this tuna?

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
We're not.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
We could be in and out of here, guys.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Just tell me, is this tuna?

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Hey, Mr. Subway, take a bite of it if you're so sure it's tuna.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
No, thank you.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
No, we can't eat.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
I'm allergic to tuna.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
I can't eat it.

45:23.000 --> 45:30.000
Is it possible, because they point out in their response that there's all these like franchisees, these like independent business owners of the franchise,

45:30.000 --> 45:36.000
that maybe the lab just went to one specific one who maybe had run out of tuna and were waiting and they were just like,

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
oh, we got to just put some crab stick in there or something.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
We just got to serve them something.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
Hey, what I'm saying, Subway, is throw someone under the bus.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Yeah.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
That's, I mean, that's what they're going to do anyway.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Time to, I guess, buy Subway stock.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
I need to call my, I need to call Jim.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Do you want a Yahoo?

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Yes, please.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Wait, can we take one?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I just need to take a brief pause.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Okay.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
For an exciting sponsor.

46:03.000 --> 46:10.000
Disney Plus Network has paid us to run the audio for this trailer that has just come through and I need to share it with you guys.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Just the audio.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Okay.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
You ready?

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Yeah, sure.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
I got to cut you.

46:17.000 --> 46:23.000
If you can't be great at hockey, it's like, don't bother.

46:23.000 --> 46:32.000
I want you to think about all the other kids who've been told that they're too small or too slow.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
They just want to get out there and play.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Let's start our own team.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
All we need is an ice rink.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
You lost?

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
You've been looking at red skates, that's up front.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Tell me the underdogs are going to come through in the end.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
You got to make this happen for yourself.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Why do you care so much?

46:57.000 --> 47:05.000
Because you care.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Did you see that?

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Oh my gosh.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Nothing but net.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
That was crazy.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Nothing but net.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Pretty sure it's basketball.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
That's right, folks, the Mighty Ducks game changers.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Gordon's back.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
The Ducks are back.

47:17.000 --> 47:24.000
Our show will be about nothing else from this point forward because the Mighty Ducks are back March 26th.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Write it on your calendars.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
I know we'll be excited.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
We got a promo code for Disney Plus.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
It's just 14 sevens.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
Hey, Justin, are you in a row?

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Are you just shilling for the show now?

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
I thought you guys would be so excited about the return of Mighty Ducks.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I'm so heartbroken that you're not thrilled.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
When you play audio from a trailer for us, first of all, you know we can't see it.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
A lot of the times there's-

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
I'll point my camera at it.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Hold on.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Let me turn on my camera.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
No, no, no.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Listen to me.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Let me finish.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
I'll text you something.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Let me finish, though.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Something funny in the audio happens where it's like, but then they didn't realize that

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
he's a chimpanzee in a person suit and we're like, good audio.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
That audio was just like, where's the skates?

48:07.000 --> 48:17.000
And it wasn't funny to me.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Do you know what I mean?

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
It wasn't funny or informative.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
It was mostly just loud sort of timpani drums.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
And there was a moment where I thought Martin Sheen was talking and now I'm thinking there

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
was maybe Emilio Estevez who's sounding more and more like his father.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Right.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I think that's what it was.

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
I texted you a picture of Emilio Estevez so you know that he's in it.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I'll look at a new picture of Emilio Estevez.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
He's looking great.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Gordon's back.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And I hope we see him out on the skates.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
He looks fucking awesome.

48:46.000 --> 48:53.000
Hey, can I just say if the kind of end of Gordon Bombay's career after-

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Bombay!

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
There it is.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Yeah, I had Gordon Shumway in my head for a long time and that's Alf.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Me too, but I didn't want to say Shumway because that's Alf.

49:00.000 --> 49:07.000
But if the end of his career arc is he owns what looks kind of like a dingy ice rink,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
this is a depressing story.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Well, he's making a comeback.

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
How many comebacks can Gordon Bombay make?

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
As many as it takes.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
As many as he needs.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
This one's gonna stick, huh?

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Probably.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
Okay, I have a Yahoo here and this one was sent in by lots of people and I'm very excited

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
to read it.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Im12 who asks, in parentheses,

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
Do you think the part where Darth Vader told Luke he was his father was part of the script?

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
Or did actor David Prowse just throw that in and it was so good that they just wrote

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
the story around it?

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
I mean, that's it, right?

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
That's it?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
That's the tale I've heard.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
That's fucking a great thing to think about.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Well, you see that all the time, right?

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
You see clips from like The Office, the Parks and Rec, right?

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Where they're just throwing out these like improvised one-liners and they're like,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Oh yeah, that's gold, that's gold, that's gold, keep it.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
And they were doing that on the Star Wars set all the time, right?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Yeah.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
That's a good point.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
Originally the line was supposed to be like, Hey, either do it or don't.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
I don't want to hear anything about trying.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
And Frank Oz kind of fucked it up and said like, Oh, do or do not, there is no try.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
What?

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
What does that even mean?

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
That was nothing.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Guys, I fucked it up.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
I said all the words wrong.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
And they were like, Oh no, no, actually we really liked it.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
I'm going to go back and rerecord all of Yoda's lines so that he talks that way.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Yeah.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Yeah.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Jabba the Hutt was originally supposed to be like, Hey, what's up?

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
It's me, the cool worm.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
Yeah.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
But then the actor in the big suit was-

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
So drunk.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
They were like, action.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
And he was like,

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
And they're like, Oh, you're okay.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
And he was like,

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
And they're like, Whoa, this is good shit.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Let's use it.

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
I heard that they didn't tell Mark Hamill, right?

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
They told him it was, what did they tell him?

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
That Obi-Wan Kenobi had killed his dad.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
That's what it said in the original script, right?

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Yeah.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
And then they sprung it on him in the moment.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Like, Luke, I'm your father.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Actually, I'm your father, Luke.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
What would have been so cool is if Luke, if Mark Hamill had been like,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Shut the fuck up.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Shut up.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
No, you're not.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
No, you killed my father.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Come on.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Do you mean to say that Obi-Wan Kenobi killed my dad?

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Because that's what I feel like you're saying.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
That explains why in the moment, if you watch this thing very carefully,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
right after Darth Vader says, I am your father,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Mark Hamill looks straight at the camera and goes,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Is someone going to call cut?

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
That was a mistake.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Now I understand why that happens.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Now it's, in my script it says,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Now I'm going to laser cut you, big boy.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
So like, I don't know why he said something different.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It just says, how about a forced sandwich?

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Which never made any sense to me.

51:53.000 --> 51:58.000
How about a forced sandwich with extra lightsaber sauce?

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
And then he kills me.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
I love in every Star Wars movie and TV show,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
someone has to say how about a forced sandwich.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
Well, it's like the Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker of the Star Wars universe, right?

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
You've got to work it in there somewhere.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
And it's so popular.

52:17.000 --> 52:24.000
That explains why even Mando Fett said it in the new Mandalorian,

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
when somebody stole his kid for the 18th time,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
and he was like, I'm going to get that kid back again.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
And they're like, oh, Mando.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And he said, yeah, how about a forced sandwich?

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
And they said, that doesn't really work here, Mando Fett.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
And he goes, hey, you're a forced sandwich.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And they're like, we'll work on it.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Do you guys think, this is a thought exercise,

52:41.000 --> 52:48.000
if we did a t-shirt that said how about a forced sandwich on it,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
do you think we would get sued?

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
No, man, all those words are free.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
Yeah, it depends on how you capitalize F in force.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Yeah, we capitalize the S in sandwich.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
No one will see that coming.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I just fucking love the idea.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
First of all, all of his lines were dubbed in by James Earl Jones.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It was a different actor and voice.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
So I'm not even sure it's the logistics of how this will work.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
David Prowse could have said anything.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
He could have said literally anything.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
But I do like the idea of him just being like, I'm your dad.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
And then he slowly side-eye looks over at George Lucas,

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
who from his chair is like, yeah, all right.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
That was just an idea I had, George.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
If you want to keep it, you can.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
That's good stuff.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Real good.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Real good.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Hey, give me four or six weeks.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I'm going to rewrite everything.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Give me four or six hours.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I'm going to rewrite everything.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I just did just a Google real quick,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and apparently it was intended from the very beginning

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
because Darth Vader sounds a lot like Dark Father,

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
which is fucking a way better name for that character.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
This is Dark Papa.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
This is Dark Father.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Hello.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Hey, I'm Shadow Dad.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
What's up?

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
What's up?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I miss a lot of soccer games.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Hey, you look hungry.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
You want a four sandwich?

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
No, I know I don't make them like your mom does.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
I'm sorry.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
I can't be your mom.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
I can't put it back together and cut it into triangles.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
I cut it in half.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
I can't put anything back together.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
We've made that very clear, okay?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I'm sorry, but I'm here now.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Do you want me to toast that?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Toasted.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I know me making those sounds with my mouth

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
didn't toast the bread.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I can't be your mom, okay?

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
I'm sorry.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Now this is podracing.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
No, Dad.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Okay.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
No, Dad, it's not.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
You're making a podracing sound with your mouth.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Why didn't Darth Vader say, I'm your father,

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
and if you would let me, I would love a chance to prove it.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Or if you want to go toss the ball around,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I happen to have these two gloves with me.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Yeah.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
That's why he tossed the lightsaber to him

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
and cut off his hand.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
He thought he was playing catch.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Oh, shit.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
It would literally be like if Dad was a stranger to us

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
and then kicked in my door and pointed a gun at me

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
and said, come work at the radio station.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
And I would be like, who are you?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
What?

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Well, the original scene,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
there was actually they edited one word out,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
which was, I am your father.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
And then he cuts off the hand and said, whoops.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
And they're like, that might be confusing

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
about his intentions there.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Okay, let's just cut the whoops

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
and make it seem like he did it on purpose.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Movie history, huh?

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
It gives me chills to think about it.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Classic movie history.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
And thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
My brother, my brother and me,

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
I had to pause to remember the last part

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
because we wrote the book on podcasting.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Hey, I want to tell you about a book.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
The Bible.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
What?

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
The good book.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
No, a different book.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
And it wasn't even one that we wrote.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Well, I wrote a little bit of it.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
It's called Things I Learned from Mario's Butt.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
It's by Laura K. Dale.

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
It is a collection of different writings

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
on video game characters' butts.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
There's lots of different contributors like myself.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
I wrote a piece that is, I think,

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
the weirdest thing I've ever written about Seaman's butt

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
and whether or not it has a butt.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
If you Google things I learned from Mario's butt,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
you'll see the link on Unbound where you can buy it.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
It's on, I think you get a Kindle edition on Amazon.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
Wherever you can find it, it's out on Thursday.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
So check it out.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
I think I've looked at it and read it,

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
especially my part because there's a little picture of me

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
and it's adorable.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
But the whole book's great.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
I think you'll really enjoy it.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Speaking of books, everybody has a podcast except you.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
It's out now.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
You can get it at bit.ly slash McElroy Podcast Book.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
Also very exciting, we're doing a Taz live show,

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
a virtual live show on February 19th

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
It is both virtual and interactive.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
We are calling it, we kind of nicknamed it,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Choose Your Own Adventure Zone.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
We're going to reach some moments where you will help vote

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
on what the players will have to do in character.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
We're gonna be playing Honey Heist with our guest,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Erika Ishii, who is amazing

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
and we're super thrilled to play with her.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Tickets are $10 and you can get them

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
over at live.themacroy.family.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
We've also got some new merch as this is a new month.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
We've got a boy car pin of the month.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
That's designed by Zach Sterling

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
and proceeds from that are going to benefit

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
Know Us Without You LA.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Know Us Without You is providing food security

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
for undocumented back of house staff

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
There's also the Taste of Luxury Stemless Wine Glasses,

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
which are so cool,

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
and a Taste of Luxury shirt designed by Kevin Budnick

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
and the Candle Nights video on demand is now for sale.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
Let's pay what you want and all proceeds will still go

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
There's a new Monster Factory that went up last Wednesday

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
that is, in my opinion,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
one of the fucking funniest episodes that we've done.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I loved it, guys, like sincere.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
It's so good.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
It's very, very good.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
We're very excited to keep playing that weird game.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Yeah, that's all at mcroy.family.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
I think that's it.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
You want the final?

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Yeah, I'd love that.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
This final Yahoo was sent in by the wizard Ben Cant.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Thank you, Ben.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
It's Yahoo Answers user.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
They are also anonymous.

58:52.000 --> 58:58.000
I'll just call them, I mean, I'll call them.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
Suzeb asks,

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
Why is there a section for dogs here?

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
There aren't that many dogs who use Yahoo.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Yes.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
This has been my brother, my brother.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
May you kiss your dad square on the lips.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Okay, that was the show.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Hope you had some fun.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Go back into the world.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Face the day ahead.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Please don't tell our grandparents

59:35.000 --> 59:43.000
all the cuss words we said.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
I'm Jesse Thorne.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
On the next Bullseye, we've got the one and only Ted Danson.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
We'll talk about his new show, Mr. Mayor, about cheers,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
and about the secret to success in comedy.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I mean, I feel like one of your signature comedic moves

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
at this point in your career is gazing.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
You do a lot of interesting gazing.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I also love this.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Gazing.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I love that.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And if I'm not, I'm going to start because that's great.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
That's Bullseye.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
