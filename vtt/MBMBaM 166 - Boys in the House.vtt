WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.280
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me to the advice show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:55.840
We are celebrating this Labor Day by marking our official entry into the podcasting union,

00:56.800 --> 01:00.560
and I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. And I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.600
And I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. We built this city!

01:05.440 --> 01:08.320
That's the theme song. If you remember Griffin,

01:08.320 --> 01:12.560
you had to change your name legally to get into the podcast union because there was already a

01:12.560 --> 01:19.040
Griffin McElroy. I'm Hollywood Griffin McElroy. It's a fucking crazy thing they make you do.

01:19.040 --> 01:24.160
They make you append to your name. And the podcasting union, I'm sure you're

01:24.160 --> 01:33.440
all familiar with some of the bylaws, but we're still going over them here. What are they?

01:33.440 --> 01:36.960
Well, I mean, I already touched on the one where you have to sing like a bar from

01:36.960 --> 01:39.120
from We Built This City on rock and roll, because it's sort of like,

01:40.480 --> 01:44.160
you know, like a togetherness thing. Like we all the podcasters together,

01:44.160 --> 01:47.440
we built the city of audio of audio broadcasting on online.

01:48.880 --> 01:53.040
Also, there's mandatory bathroom breaks every 10 minutes in the recording,

01:53.040 --> 01:54.800
whether you need to or not. Yeah.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.400
And you have to force something out. Someone accompanies you to the bathroom.

02:01.120 --> 02:08.000
I've got these like horrible gorilla grip marks on my I don't want to get blue,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.480
but on the shaft of my penis that it comes from like trying to wring it out like

02:13.360 --> 02:16.640
some sort of Mandarin orange. It's like trying to milk a thirsty cow.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.560
Why would the cow do it?

02:18.560 --> 02:22.320
I don't think the cow has to be thirsty. No, that's actually a podcast regulation

02:22.320 --> 02:25.840
that you have to make a weird metaphor about once a show.

02:25.840 --> 02:29.680
Well, we're already fucking set on that front. I don't think we need to do anything extra to

02:30.240 --> 02:33.120
say you did talk about like gorilla on your penis or something.

02:33.120 --> 02:39.520
So like talking about like we have to squeeze our dicks and sing copyrighted songs on our

02:39.520 --> 02:43.280
podcast now, like we're not really getting anything out of this fucking union that we

02:43.280 --> 02:47.200
just joined. I should have spoken up before we signed up like you guys were all about it.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.280
And I should have voiced these reservations before I squeezed my dick off.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.000
It has been much worse since Marc Maron became the president.

02:54.560 --> 03:01.120
He has instituted a lot of the more pressing, I think, inconvenient rules to the union.

03:01.120 --> 03:05.360
Guy's a big dick squeezer. I had no idea from way back.

03:05.360 --> 03:10.960
The main purpose of the podcast union is not for the here and now, it's for the future.

03:10.960 --> 03:16.400
And the agreement is basically when the revolution comes and the sheer just

03:16.400 --> 03:24.560
just utter uselessness of each of our skill sets becomes revealed to the light of day,

03:25.200 --> 03:27.840
we promise not to turn on each other.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.480
Right. That's important. And it's also like an exclusivity thing because one of these fucking

03:32.480 --> 03:36.720
days everyone listening to this podcast is going to realize that we're just three dickheads that

03:36.720 --> 03:40.960
bought microphones and that this is the easiest thing to do in the universe. And we're going to

03:40.960 --> 03:44.640
get we're going to get replaced. And this exclusivity is going to be the only thing.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.960
They're going to do it. They're going to do it better and they're going to do it cheaper.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.600
But, you know, they're not going to do it legally scabs.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.440
Right. Can't have machines doing podcasting with these laws.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.640
Not, you know, you know, Jordan Morris is a scab.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.600
Yeah. And a machine and a machine.

03:59.600 --> 04:04.800
He's a machine bar and squeezes his dick. Like, get out of here, Tandy.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.360
Get out of your Tandy 200.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.400
While we're trying to sort some of these the nuances of these laws out

04:14.400 --> 04:17.840
and how we can exploit them, let's answer some questions just to kill time till the

04:17.840 --> 04:23.840
next bathroom break. And then we'll we'll we'll repeat. Ever since I was little,

04:23.840 --> 04:27.680
my parents have maintained a multi. I just want to mark this occasion.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.600
I think that was the least funny intro.

04:31.840 --> 04:36.480
Sixty five episodes, not a single goddamn solid joke in the entire.

04:36.480 --> 04:40.640
What you don't know is that we have to reset every hundred and sixty six episodes

04:40.640 --> 04:44.160
because we were getting too funny at the beginning and expectations were getting too high.

04:44.160 --> 04:49.120
And next week and we can really phone it in. Not a single well composed gag in the entire one.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.720
We really it was really I just wanted to mark the occasion.

04:52.720 --> 04:56.080
Ever since I was little, my parents have maintained a multi pet household.

04:56.080 --> 05:01.120
Almost all the animals live long, healthy lives. The only animals my parents apparently

05:01.120 --> 05:06.480
aren't adept at caring for are parakeets, since these tend to pass away relatively early

05:07.440 --> 05:11.760
within a few years. If that the problem is, my parents keep getting parakeets.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.520
Brothers, how do I politely inform my parents that they should stop trying to care

05:15.520 --> 05:20.480
for these tiny birds and instead focus their attention on animals they can actually care for?

05:20.480 --> 05:24.960
Is there a graceful way to go about doing this? Sincerely, Flummoxed in Philly.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.520
So the problem is your your parents are bird murderers.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.480
They're bird-murderers.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.000
I don't think there's a graceful way to handle it,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.440
but there are like a hundred really super forceful ways to do it.

05:33.440 --> 05:39.280
Yeah, I think number one is liberate them every time they buy them.

05:39.280 --> 05:46.640
Let me throw this out. What about like an Oscar-style video of all the parakeets that they've lost

05:46.640 --> 05:51.120
in that previous season? It's just like a video of all the parakeets with

05:51.120 --> 05:56.880
really sad music underneath and then like captions of their name and like 2005 to 2006.

05:59.920 --> 06:04.640
Maybe you lack the, you know, the iMovie skills to throw something like that together.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.120
Maybe you just pile up all the bird corpses on the table

06:07.120 --> 06:13.680
and say look and then you you say this is more than all the other pets that you've had combined.

06:13.680 --> 06:19.520
Why did this is your 215th bird like clearly didn't work out the other 214 times.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.600
Are your parents cats?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.680
Key information that should have been included.

06:28.240 --> 06:32.160
If they don't care, if they don't take the parakeets from the pet store,

06:32.160 --> 06:34.640
they'll just get eaten there. I mean somebody will eat them.

06:34.640 --> 06:40.480
You gotta look at, you gotta have a talk with your parents about the relative bone density

06:40.480 --> 06:44.560
of these pets that they're buying because you get a dog, you get a mastiff,

06:44.560 --> 06:48.080
that's a fucking sturdy animal. You can't, it is very hard.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.520
Good luck killing that.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.440
Good luck crushing that mastiff, you can't do it.

06:51.440 --> 06:56.240
A parakeet, a fucking a stiff wind, you turn the ceiling fan on high

06:56.240 --> 06:58.560
and it's it is compressed into the loam.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.840
Are both your parents Lenny from Vice and Men?

07:01.840 --> 07:03.600
We should have clarified that before.

07:03.600 --> 07:07.600
We should just define what your parents are. Are they regular human beings?

07:07.600 --> 07:10.800
Apparently not because regular human beings can take care of like birds.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.840
You just give them seeds and then they're pretty much good to go.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.720
They need heartier stock birds. Maybe give them some like crows.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, but then they definitely can't get fucking don't.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.040
You can't have parakeets and crows because crows will just eat the parakeets.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.360
Unless it's like one of those adorable videos where like,

07:27.360 --> 07:29.920
you know, a dog becomes friends with a deer or something.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.440
Yeah, crows are generally known for that kind of cross-species friendship behavior.

07:33.440 --> 07:38.960
You know, people never talk about the look at these adorable friends videos that they,

07:38.960 --> 07:44.400
the inception of every single one of those has to be an act of almost unimaginable neglect.

07:45.040 --> 07:50.320
How did you let the gorilla get close enough to the kitten that they became best friends?

07:50.320 --> 07:51.920
How did you mess up so bad?

07:51.920 --> 07:56.240
There's a dog in that tiger cage, you guys. Is no one else seeing this?

07:56.240 --> 07:58.560
You know, it's better taking care of that tiger or that dog.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.880
A trained animal professional, I bet.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.920
I bet that dog is not like giving it its shots and shit.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.960
I'm just saying I'm a way better friend to tigers and dogs

08:06.960 --> 08:09.840
than either of those species could ever possibly be.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.760
Not some weird animal matchmaker.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.600
It's like, let's see if these hate each other.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.920
Oh, well, another failed experiment.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.560
Sorry, YouTube.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.000
Not gonna make my YouTube partner money check this this month

08:20.000 --> 08:21.520
because I couldn't find a good pairing.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.160
Is that what's going on?

08:22.160 --> 08:24.640
You're trying to get your parents are trying to YouTube matchmake.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.800
They're putting parakeets together with every...

08:26.800 --> 08:31.200
There's not an animal that won't just instinctively fucking kill a parakeet.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.480
There's got to be an animal.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.920
Dorsey, we've tried them all.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.560
Iguana and parakeet, no.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.040
Damn it.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.800
Gorilla and parakeet, no.

08:38.800 --> 08:41.280
They are the Cheetos of the aviary world.

08:41.280 --> 08:41.680
You just...

08:44.000 --> 08:44.640
It was good.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.600
I'll have 15 more.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.400
It's got to be grim for them because they're looking down towards the end of the alphabet.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.960
The only things they're seeing are Wolverine and zebra

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
and they don't feel great about their chances.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.240
Even a zebra.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.560
It's like, my stripes are weird.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.720
Do you think that when her parents roll up

09:02.720 --> 09:04.800
or his parents roll up to the pet store,

09:04.800 --> 09:07.360
like the other parakeets see him like, oh, shit, they're back.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.000
Oh, fuck.

09:08.000 --> 09:08.480
Here we go.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.040
Oh, no.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.560
It's like the third time this month.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.920
Little girl in Finding Nemo like, I will have six parakeets.

09:13.920 --> 09:14.400
Like, nope.

09:15.280 --> 09:15.920
Nope, you won't.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.280
No, no, no.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.760
I definitely sold you parakeets on Tuesday.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.240
So are you a magician?

09:22.240 --> 09:23.760
Are you a shitty wizard?

09:23.760 --> 09:24.480
What's going on?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.360
What's going on?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.840
Are you transforming them into humans to live out human lives?

09:27.840 --> 09:28.400
Probably not.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.000
Matchmaking, huh?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.280
We're all part of that game.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.040
We got a ring in the back room.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.640
It's kind of like an animal fighting ring, except it's not supposed to be.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.040
It's supposed to be an animal hugging ring.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.400
Do you ever see that movie Fight Club?

09:41.360 --> 09:41.680
Yeah.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.520
What do you think about it?

09:43.520 --> 09:44.480
It really made me think.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.800
Also, we have an animal fight club.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.840
Also, you've been a parakeet the entire time.

09:49.840 --> 09:54.400
Are your parents parakeets?

09:54.400 --> 09:55.120
Wait a minute.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.880
That doesn't make sense.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.400
Of all of nature's creatures, you'd think parakeets would be a depth of care.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.920
Although not in the human world.

10:01.920 --> 10:06.560
They don't have access to some of the twigs or berries that they would have in a parakeet

10:06.560 --> 10:07.840
native environment.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.200
I would say that, Justin, the problem is that you're assuming that her parents started off

10:11.200 --> 10:12.160
as parakeets.

10:12.160 --> 10:16.320
I was inferring that they had once been human and were now parakeets.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.360
And we're looking for the parakeet wizard that had turned them into parakeets for

10:19.360 --> 10:20.000
mistreating them.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.280
I clearly should have inferred that dumb shitty thing that you were thinking.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.720
I don't know why I was thinking like a grown man.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.920
Read a damn book.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.240
What book has that plot?

10:29.680 --> 10:30.960
James Bond novels?

10:30.960 --> 10:31.440
I guess.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.600
I don't think so.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.640
I've read them all.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.840
I think you're illiterate.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.240
I've read them all and they're all about parakeet wizards.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.640
Griffin, can you read us a Yahoo answer?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.160
Yeah, I'll read you a few if you want.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.080
Or we can just do one at a time like we usually do.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.280
Okay, this Yahoo was sent in by David Byrne.

10:50.320 --> 10:53.920
Assumedly not the David Byrne, but this one is still pretty good, I think.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.400
Thanks, David.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
It's by Yahoo interviewer Sage, who asks,

10:57.120 --> 10:58.240
Why am I so hungry?

10:58.240 --> 10:59.360
Am I not growing?

10:59.360 --> 10:59.680
Male.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.040
Okay, wait.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.240
M-A-L-E?

11:04.240 --> 11:05.040
M-A-I-L?

11:05.040 --> 11:05.680
M-A-L-E.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.800
They're just giving us a little bit of extra info up in the headline.

11:08.800 --> 11:13.280
Which, frankly, your gender does inform a lot of things.

11:13.280 --> 11:18.160
Not in a sexist way, but it's helpful information when we provide you information.

11:18.160 --> 11:21.760
Flomex in Philly couldn't even specify the species of his parent in these questions.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.560
That's what I'm saying.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.640
I would prefer if in the future, whenever you do provide a question, it's just like,

11:26.640 --> 11:28.000
My parents are parakeets.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.720
Female.

11:28.720 --> 11:29.280
You know what I mean?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.640
Anyway, Sage asks,

11:32.640 --> 11:35.600
Okay, I had a decent lunch today at school and it did fill me up.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.760
I come home and I'm really hungry.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.760
I ate two PBJ sandwiches and almost a whole big bag of Doritos.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.920
Holy three minutes later, I'm still hungry.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.920
So I eat vegetables and some rice after and I'm still a little hungry, but not starving.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.160
Why?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.240
I'm not so hungry like this.

11:50.240 --> 11:55.840
Only one night I was starving and after dinner, two hours later, I'm so hungry I can eat horse.

11:57.040 --> 12:01.680
I am five foot five and almost five foot six and think I'm 14 years old.

12:01.680 --> 12:01.920
Whoa.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.960
Five foot six, I think, and I'm 14 years old and six months old.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.200
And half Caucasian and Filipino.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.240
My dad is five and nine.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.760
Okay, wait, I cracked it.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.080
I, my dad is five, nine grand on his side.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.480
Oh God, this fucking question.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.960
Five, nine and mom's side is short.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.000
Frown face.

12:20.000 --> 12:20.800
All caps.

12:20.800 --> 12:25.840
I did experience growing pains in both of my legs two weeks ago from today.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.760
And sadly no growing that night.

12:27.760 --> 12:28.480
Frown.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.280
Only when I was 11, I had them and I grew two inches.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.000
Please.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.040
How tall will I be?

12:35.040 --> 12:37.920
Is it possible to grow like one inch in three to four months?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.240
So that's three inches in a year?

12:40.240 --> 12:42.480
When am I going to go through my adolescence growth spurt?

12:42.480 --> 12:42.800
Help.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.040
Wait a minute.

12:45.040 --> 12:50.320
This guy just decided halfway through this question that he didn't like his old question

12:50.320 --> 12:53.520
and he was going to ask a new question and hope none of us noticed.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.880
He took a hard right.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.400
Yeah, he's trying for a twofer.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.720
I ate some burritos and they did not fill me up.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.600
So I switched to veggies and rice and that got me pretty close.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.400
What the fuck?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.240
Also, what's up with my dick hair?

13:04.240 --> 13:05.680
When am I getting that stuff?

13:05.680 --> 13:05.920
Help.

13:05.920 --> 13:06.420
Help.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.400
Mail.

13:08.400 --> 13:08.720
Mail.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.320
When he says he experienced growing pains but didn't actually grow.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.000
Did he just mean his legs hurt?

13:14.000 --> 13:17.360
Yeah, I think did someone maybe punch you in both of the legs over like a bully?

13:17.360 --> 13:18.240
Are you being bullied?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.040
Maybe you ate too many goddamn Doritos and you got diabetes.

13:21.040 --> 13:21.600
Sage mail.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.120
Do you have arterial blockage in your legs because of all the Doritos?

13:26.000 --> 13:32.240
There's got to be a problem when you say you are not hungry.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.840
You're like not getting full.

13:33.840 --> 13:39.440
Cool, but then he clearly said that he ate almost a whole bag of Doritos.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.560
So that's really some pretty impressive self-restraint.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.080
But he doesn't say what size bag.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.800
I don't care the size of the bag.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.920
It could be a snack pack.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.760
It could be like a lunch snack pack bag.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.640
Okay, but when he did know what you're not understanding.

13:52.640 --> 13:56.240
He didn't finish the bag and yet he was still hungry.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.440
So why this solution?

13:57.440 --> 13:58.480
There's an easy solution.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.800
Well, maybe he knew his fucking if I had a roommate.

14:00.800 --> 14:05.680
A full first of all, if I had a 14 year old 14.5 year old roommate.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.720
I would be probably arrested.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.640
But second of all, if he finished the whole bag of Doritos that I bought.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.480
I would be fucking furious.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.320
He probably knew that his moms would come home.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.200
And if there was no Doritos bag, she would be pissed off.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.000
She's probably still pretty upset that most of the bag is gone.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.560
But at least there's a little bit of crumbles left over for.

14:24.560 --> 14:29.200
I'm actually impressed with the level of thought process that went through this kid's head.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.760
Because usually we get some real boners.

14:31.760 --> 14:35.040
But this kid at least sat there and said, why had two PBJ sandwiches?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.040
And I'm almost done with this bag of Doritos.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.960
Maybe I should switch to like vegetables.

14:39.600 --> 14:44.160
Maybe like something that won't, you know, give me diabetes will help.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.040
Yeah, that's pretty clever for a Yahoo answers.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.760
And even also the bar is real low.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.960
The bar is so low.

14:50.960 --> 14:58.080
I like the idea of eating food and there being an instantaneous mechanical response within your

14:58.080 --> 15:00.400
body beyond just like boy in this blob.

15:01.520 --> 15:06.000
I like, yeah, like if this kid ate a licorice jelly bean and turned into a ladder,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.200
what are you talking about?

15:07.760 --> 15:10.800
Kind of like that, I guess, a little mechanical response.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.480
It's everything that you called for.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.520
I want I want I like the idea of like, you know, you're growing.

15:17.520 --> 15:23.040
So you eat like 15 sandwiches and you go to bed and there's a full blown big miracle.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.920
And you wake up the next morning and Tom Hanks and you are like,

15:25.920 --> 15:27.680
I got to write down what I ate.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.720
And then you post on the Internet.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.600
If you want to turn into Tom Hanks is all it takes is 15 sandwiches.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.640
It's got that was actually my favorite episode of man versus food.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.480
I ate 15 pizzas and I turned into a ladder.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.520
What the fuck happened?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.880
This round goes to man.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.400
Does it does this next episode on ladder versus food?

15:52.400 --> 15:55.200
Just stack all the French fries on my rungs.

15:55.200 --> 16:00.560
Here, we got a T-shirt for you for completing this challenge in Europe.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.760
Is it extra ladder?

16:02.720 --> 16:04.320
Can you stretch it?

16:04.320 --> 16:06.640
Can you stretch it over my rung to girth?

16:08.560 --> 16:10.720
Producers, we just got to play this one by ear.

16:14.240 --> 16:19.440
I guess I guess have a pretty lady climb on top of me and just pour all the milkshakes down me.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.440
And we'll see what happens.

16:21.440 --> 16:25.200
Maybe I'll transform into like a I don't know, a horse or something.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.000
And then we can just sort of that's moving, I think, in the right direction.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.120
Maybe the next leap will finally be the leap that takes me home.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.720
I would I would celebrate all the pizzas.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.080
Why haven't I left it to a horse?

16:36.640 --> 16:40.480
Organic entity that could consume would be great for getting a noose.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.600
Another season.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.480
I don't think I'm going to get the season two as a ladder.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.360
How about another question?

16:47.360 --> 16:51.280
My wife and I were listening to Islands in the Stream by country legends,

16:51.280 --> 16:52.800
Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.

16:53.360 --> 16:57.120
It's a fantastic song, but we're really bothered by the line.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.840
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.400
Help us think of some better lyrics that don't sound like someone has lice.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.960
And that's from Lyrically Challenged Ladies of DC.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.760
There are I don't know this song.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.080
There are you first of all, you are.

17:14.080 --> 17:14.640
Yes, you do.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.040
Second of all, there are children dying in the streets.

17:18.080 --> 17:18.880
There are children.

17:18.880 --> 17:23.360
I could open my window right now and see two or three children just dying.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.800
And this is how you want us to spend.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.040
This is how you want to drain this think tank.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.000
I got a pretty good lyric for you.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.400
Lyrically Challenged Ladies of DC.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.360
You want to hear my lyric?

17:36.000 --> 17:36.640
Syria.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.080
Think about it.

17:38.080 --> 17:46.080
think about it see I don't know Justin I think it doesn't rhyme I don't think it

17:46.080 --> 17:50.120
rhymes also it's you're not allowed to just I can install like 14 syllables

17:50.120 --> 17:54.640
into one word Travis you do know this okay Travis have you heard the song

17:54.640 --> 18:00.760
ghetto superstar yes okay have you ever heard Kenny Rogers sing a song like and

18:00.760 --> 18:04.360
you were confused like I didn't know that Kenny Rogers covered this one

18:04.360 --> 18:15.680
interesting I said up to get you with what could that possibly look at that I

18:15.680 --> 18:19.720
mean I guess I don't even know what they're maybe they really had that they

18:19.720 --> 18:22.240
really had to sort through the riffraff really had to sort through the

18:22.240 --> 18:26.560
Hammond anchors yeah or maybe they one person one of them died in a car accident

18:26.560 --> 18:30.280
when they went over a cliff and the other one dragged the lake for them and

18:30.280 --> 18:34.520
that's how they found them and then they were brought back to life like in

18:34.520 --> 18:40.640
Corpse Bride or maybe it was like the person shrunk down and was trapped in

18:40.640 --> 18:44.480
Rick Moranis his hair yeah and they were trying to like comb through Rick

18:44.480 --> 18:47.840
Moranis his hair but they had to use really fine tooth combs yet very what's

18:47.840 --> 18:56.920
that smell Rick Rick pal we need to talk about your habits I'm saying Rick

18:56.920 --> 19:01.120
Moranis probably has a stinky ass scalp if you if that's if you want to dissect

19:01.120 --> 19:07.960
that goof and I don't I I'm saying to a diet rich in poutine has probably

19:07.960 --> 19:13.200
engraved his scalp with with a substance that's not good to be you know close to

19:13.200 --> 19:16.380
I've never been close to the man but that's just a theory from an olfactory

19:16.380 --> 19:22.880
personal factory nose-bound perspective I think the problem with islands in the

19:22.880 --> 19:26.640
stream is that if you're writing a song in 2013 and this is what it lacks this

19:26.640 --> 19:33.400
is why it's not timely you have to have product placement that and and that's

19:33.400 --> 19:37.160
the only way you're gonna be able to pay for Rick Rubin to come in and help you

19:37.160 --> 19:43.520
build your sort of rough sketch of an album into the you know a chart topper

19:43.520 --> 19:50.960
so maybe something like you should try x-body spray grizzly scent like that's

19:50.960 --> 19:56.360
gonna be that that's gonna be I totally dig this idea but it's gonna be hard to

19:56.360 --> 20:02.920
replace every word so like so like maybe we can be like I set out to Pringles

20:02.920 --> 20:09.640
with an Xbox one and then you guys are better at this than me cuz all I could

20:09.640 --> 20:14.760
come up with was I said how to get you with a fine-toothed flome and I don't

20:14.760 --> 20:18.120
even think I don't think it's a product that you can buy I mean sure you can

20:18.120 --> 20:23.800
probably buy it on like some weird alternative eBay but you know I read in

20:23.800 --> 20:26.880
Malcolm Gladwell's the tipping point that that kind of thing is all it takes

20:26.880 --> 20:31.720
to really launch a product back into the American consciousness what what product

20:31.720 --> 20:39.920
has fallen out of favors like flow I sell that to get you with you you who

20:39.920 --> 20:45.880
that's quick strawberry flavor now we're talking okay but now we're not talking

20:45.880 --> 20:50.040
about like profiting in the commercial since now we're pushing our own social

20:50.040 --> 20:53.680
agendas like if it was me it would be more of it was like I set out to get

20:53.680 --> 20:59.040
you with some Frank and Barry okay that's that you want it that is the one

20:59.040 --> 21:04.520
product you want to defibrillate if now if you want to push social agendas in

21:04.520 --> 21:12.040
the song I'm into that too you get I set out to get you with my gay marriage

21:12.040 --> 21:17.960
license that I can get in any state now come on and then the harmony sounds like

21:17.960 --> 21:22.120
a Macklemore song now the harmony could be just to Kenny Rogers's he could just

21:22.120 --> 21:25.200
harmonize with himself and that would be very beautiful I'm into that yeah I'm

21:25.200 --> 21:33.080
really into can we do both okay where it's like appeal Doma and eat some

21:33.080 --> 21:39.280
tastations now you could be more subversive me and Frank and Barry headed

21:39.280 --> 21:47.560
to the chapel this is good this is good cuz I'm gonna marry Frank and Barry who

21:47.560 --> 21:51.320
I'm assuming has male parts down there I don't think you can gender Frank and

21:51.320 --> 21:57.760
Barry when I think about Frank and Barry's genitals and God do I his Frank

21:57.760 --> 22:03.880
and Barry that's like 90 minutes out of every day for me don't even try to call

22:03.880 --> 22:10.640
Griffin from 1245 to 115 once or is it spread out throughout the day I mean I

22:10.640 --> 22:19.760
once I get in the flow once I once I get my noodle going but in both senses of

22:19.760 --> 22:24.480
the phrase I whittled that down too because you have you used to have to

22:24.480 --> 22:28.240
spend six hours a day thinking about Frank various genitals just to consent

22:28.240 --> 22:31.760
like get yourself in the headspace yeah which was tough I wasn't not getting a

22:31.760 --> 22:37.440
lot of sleep back then anyway it's a just fleshy patch just fleshy blank

22:37.440 --> 22:43.880
patch and that's what gets you going you know people never talk about that part

22:43.880 --> 22:49.040
of the creation of Frankenstein's monster because there had to be a night

22:49.040 --> 22:52.760
when someone looked at Victor Frankenstein and he just came back with

22:52.760 --> 22:58.040
a giant bag of dicks I'm going to find the one that fits him perfectly like why

22:58.040 --> 23:02.000
you're really agonized you just grab you grab the set of hands at random they're

23:02.000 --> 23:10.080
both laughs you put like days of R&D into this I like to think that Igor was

23:10.080 --> 23:14.320
actually like super like self homophobic and so he just like went out and like

23:14.320 --> 23:19.120
ah I guess just ah you just like took the first one he saw and like put it in

23:19.120 --> 23:23.000
the back me an abnormal dick Frankenstein was like what the fuck I

23:23.000 --> 23:26.440
just can you just do it like no one's ever gonna no one's gonna want to fuck

23:26.440 --> 23:31.560
this creep can you just take it I will listen I'll do anything else but pick

23:31.560 --> 23:37.640
any part I will go harvest it but come on it's a dead dick doc just use this

23:37.640 --> 23:43.920
one just use this one you know the dicks the first part to go to and the

23:43.920 --> 23:49.320
decomposition rigor mortis will get you to 24 hours that's it that ship done

23:49.320 --> 23:55.600
sailed yeah that's cuz bugs are nasty bugs you nasty so nasty all of them

23:55.600 --> 24:00.840
anyway oh man I grossed myself out let's do a Yahoo hit me also I just want to

24:00.840 --> 24:04.320
say right now before we get the emails I know they talk about Frankenstein's dick

24:04.320 --> 24:07.840
in young Frankenstein you guys you don't have to tell us about it so I've never

24:07.840 --> 24:11.520
seen it that's why I don't watch movies or TV oh you don't spoil the goofs I

24:11.520 --> 24:15.560
well yeah I just want everybody to know that everything comes from my heart this

24:15.560 --> 24:18.840
this Yahoo was sent in by Nicole Harris thank you Nicole it's by Yahoo answers

24:18.840 --> 24:27.240
user Riker who asks werewolf question werewolves only my friend says that I

24:27.240 --> 24:30.920
might have been born a werewolf I've always thought of myself to have an

24:30.920 --> 24:35.400
inner wolf I'm just starting to physically shift but I have no memory of

24:35.400 --> 24:40.520
when I shift and how to control it someone please help werewolves only this

24:40.520 --> 24:45.080
question would be way better if they said werewolves only who was that guy

24:45.080 --> 24:51.680
that played mr. Feeney on boys werewolves only looking for a werewolf

24:51.680 --> 24:57.560
perspective please wasn't the same guy in 1776 hey get the fuck out of here

24:57.560 --> 25:02.760
regular old human you me you know the I could help this guy but because he's

25:02.760 --> 25:07.280
being so fucking specious I'm not even going to I mean I can't help him I can

25:07.280 --> 25:14.600
weigh in cuz I my so my grandfather was a quarter werewolf so that makes me 116

25:14.600 --> 25:23.040
you and fucking Megan Fox man killing me if for me and again my cycle only comes

25:23.040 --> 25:32.280
once every 16 full moons my where are you predict it is it is tricky if you

25:32.280 --> 25:37.640
wear it really tight-fitting clothing sometimes it'll just cancel it out also

25:37.640 --> 25:40.680
for some reason a cloud in front of the moon so if you get like a haze machine

25:40.680 --> 25:45.640
recovered yeah so Griffin found the one reminder that Siri refuses to create for

25:45.640 --> 25:51.160
him Siri in 16 months remind me I'm gonna change into a werewolf I'm not

25:51.160 --> 25:54.400
going to do now that's I'm not gonna waste time I'm not gonna waste your time

25:54.400 --> 25:59.160
or mine how does this person know that they're going through the change if they

25:59.160 --> 26:03.920
can't remember the change does it is like they wake up and they're like I

26:03.920 --> 26:06.800
think I was a werewolf well that no they were probably they were watching

26:06.800 --> 26:12.240
America's Next Top Model 2.0 boys in the house and fucking like they start

26:12.240 --> 26:16.160
watching it and they get to like the beginning of the first challenge and

26:16.160 --> 26:19.200
then all of a sudden fucking Tyree just kick someone off and they're like what

26:19.200 --> 26:24.320
the fuck there was like 45 minutes there well I don't know what happened and then

26:24.320 --> 26:29.520
they look around and all their pets are dead that part was actually her keys

26:29.520 --> 26:32.360
that would probably be the first I don't even think a werewolf will waste his

26:32.360 --> 26:35.080
fucking time in a parakeet but that would probably be the more telling

26:35.080 --> 26:41.320
evidence I gotta know what happened in the fucking photo in the fucking photo

26:41.320 --> 26:47.520
shoot also my dog is dead my dog has been eviscerated all right I think the

26:47.520 --> 26:57.320
most important thing from this show that so far is that I learned that the new

26:57.320 --> 27:00.360
cycle of America's Next Top Model started which I was not aware yeah

27:00.360 --> 27:06.980
started fucking Justin 2.0 they changed the goddamn game boys in the house so

27:06.980 --> 27:09.520
they're boys in the house there are girls in the house too but there's also

27:09.520 --> 27:17.640
boys in the house and let's just say things get a little sexy did you sorry

27:17.640 --> 27:20.800
did you hear that I put a little too much smoke in that I've missed a month

27:20.800 --> 27:25.000
that was a little smoky yeah I can describe everything that's happened in

27:25.000 --> 27:29.120
every season so we're in every episode first episode first episode they line

27:29.120 --> 27:32.360
them all up at the top of staircase and they say guys go pick a girl from the

27:32.360 --> 27:35.400
other side walk down the staircase do a pose and that's how they introduce all

27:35.400 --> 27:40.480
the guys and girls to each other this one super fucking fresh dude walks to

27:40.480 --> 27:45.720
the stairs looks at the women shakes his head no this will not do turns around to

27:45.720 --> 27:50.040
the dudes picks a dude walks down the stairs kisses him on the mouth turns to

27:50.040 --> 27:56.240
everyone like what's up fucking crowd like just burns the fucking building

27:56.240 --> 27:59.920
down around them just like starts tearing downstairs like the dopest thing

27:59.920 --> 28:06.000
I've ever seen fuck it's the fucking dopest moment in reality show history

28:06.000 --> 28:09.040
the other dude the other dude was like straight as an arrow like I don't even

28:09.040 --> 28:16.200
fucking care that was the freshest and dopest thing I'll ever be a part of it

28:16.200 --> 28:20.280
is required watching also they've changed the theme song so it does the

28:20.280 --> 28:24.680
wannabe on top a guy's voice comes in and goes boys in the house and it's my

28:24.680 --> 28:29.920
favorite it's it beats out growing pains it beats out full house it beats out

28:29.920 --> 28:34.320
family matters for greatest theme song for greatest TV song I have a wonderful

28:34.320 --> 28:45.840
transition into the money

28:45.840 --> 28:52.120
so I'm really from the discovery that I am late on America's next top model but

28:52.120 --> 28:58.760
I am not panicking and do you know why why because America's next top model is

28:58.760 --> 29:06.480

talented secretary miss Shana Feinberg Shana I understand you've been doing a

33:20.320 --> 33:23.860
bit of research to find out what listeners think of the show yes I have

33:23.860 --> 33:28.400

33:40.780 --> 33:51.440
maximum fun was that too much no I think it was perfect

33:51.440 --> 34:12.040
I thought you were building to a drop wisdom boys versus girls versus cows

34:12.040 --> 34:20.760
cows in the house I just don't think Monica has what it takes that is a

34:20.760 --> 34:27.920
fucking seat though that cow just tooched fucking 1.2 tons of booty I have

34:27.920 --> 34:31.640
never seen anything like it the game has changed her udders found the fucking

34:31.640 --> 34:37.600
light farm was to see those two cows kissing it was insane farm wisdom is

34:37.600 --> 34:41.960
our regular segment where we bring you real applicable wisdom straight from

34:41.960 --> 34:46.200
farmers and the people that love them or know them here's one from see Dan can I

34:46.200 --> 34:48.880
read can I read it can I read it can I read it I thought you didn't have this

34:48.880 --> 34:54.240
in front of you I pulled it up now okay yes Travis go ahead from see Daniels

34:54.240 --> 35:00.840
when some farmers have a branding they not the calves okay sometimes they they

35:00.840 --> 35:06.400
will save the testicles and eat them after I've seen this firsthand they

35:06.400 --> 35:12.440
treat them like it's Halloween candy or something that's not like to imagine

35:12.440 --> 35:17.560
they do it right in the cab space that is not like not only does that suck it

35:17.560 --> 35:22.720
sucks that there's someone out there that calls removing the testicles of a

35:22.720 --> 35:28.760
living thing nut they nut they nutted that calf did they cook that do they

35:28.760 --> 35:31.960
cook is there any preparation because this guy just makes it sound like shink

35:31.960 --> 35:35.560
and then pop like a couple rolos or something no it's like no it's like that

35:35.560 --> 35:38.960
scene in Game of Thrones where the Khaleesi eats the horse's heart it's

35:38.960 --> 35:45.520
very similar back in June I heard a bit of farm wisdom from my dear friend Rita

35:45.520 --> 35:50.240
Mangoli who creates the fantastic comic series today in three panels in fact she

35:50.240 --> 35:56.960
memorialized said wisdom in comic form I've attached it here for you the the

35:56.960 --> 36:00.280
wisdom and we're enjoying this delightful comic I guess you guys can't

36:00.280 --> 36:06.760
see it but we'll put it where Griffin where we put it a flicker we'll put it

36:06.760 --> 36:12.280
on the forums or we'll tweet it one of those two at MB and BAM by ways us

36:12.280 --> 36:18.400
here's the wisdom you can grow a plant that has potatoes as its roots and

36:18.400 --> 36:25.280
tomatoes as its fruits that's bullshit that feels to me like something that's

36:25.280 --> 36:29.400
not true that's like the part of that feels to me like an abomination against

36:29.400 --> 36:34.920
God I think it's the plot of the Tamako episode of the Simpsons I can't believe

36:34.920 --> 36:38.160
that this food exists and that this plant fucking exists and that it's not

36:38.160 --> 36:42.720
like the only thing that farmers are planting to double to double their you

36:42.720 --> 36:46.240
know their gains do you think sometimes the plants get it backwards and they

36:46.240 --> 36:49.920
just grow potatoes of their fruits and they get like a bunch of dirty smushed

36:49.920 --> 36:53.080
tomatoes under the ground like yeah you fucking like they cut into their

36:53.080 --> 36:57.840
potatoes and it's just full of like tomato guts or they find like a whole

36:57.840 --> 37:02.280
chicken inside you're like oh god my farm is my farm is starting to

37:02.280 --> 37:08.000
desynchronize so that's an amazing fact if true which is almost certainly not

37:08.000 --> 37:11.520
true thank you for the farm wisdom if you want to send us from wisdom or

37:11.520 --> 37:15.720
literally anything else in B and B a.m. at maximum fun if you could combine

37:15.720 --> 37:19.920
address combine two plants what would be and I know you're asking Griffin you're

37:19.920 --> 37:22.640
asking this question because you obviously have an answer and the answer

37:22.640 --> 37:27.840
is yes I do weed and oranges because then you get that juicy orange and

37:27.840 --> 37:35.080
that's gonna taste tremendous it's gonna taste a little balmy like it's gonna get

37:35.080 --> 37:40.280
a little a little bit of residue on it but otherwise it's a perfectly fine

37:40.280 --> 37:44.760
orange that's it that's perfect for me because the Floridian stoners it

37:44.760 --> 37:48.240
attracts will eat the mosquitoes so it's really great for your garden too yeah

37:48.240 --> 37:51.440
okay bros you've settled the peeing in the shower question but what's your

37:51.440 --> 37:54.400
stance on brushing your teeth in the shower no one does it next question

37:54.400 --> 37:57.320
that's the easy one we don't have to solve it cuz nobody fucking does it in

37:57.320 --> 38:02.480
the universe people do it I'm married to someone who has done it oh god like I'm

38:02.480 --> 38:09.680
a dare I guess in a hurry it bothers me enough to brush my teeth in the kitchen

38:09.680 --> 38:14.160
sink yeah that's because so out of goddamn place that's where you dump your

38:14.160 --> 38:20.440
fucking french fry oil Travis I know but it feels wrong but like if someone is

38:20.440 --> 38:24.200
using my bathroom like I need to brush my teeth and I want to schedule by the

38:24.200 --> 38:27.080
way don't it's like I should mention don't dump your french fry oil down the

38:27.080 --> 38:32.120
sink you're supposed to like take it to Best Buy or something in the front

38:32.120 --> 38:36.760
there's laptop battery cell phone batteries French French fry I have a

38:36.760 --> 38:41.160
rule I I would never brush my teeth in the shower because that's where I pee

38:41.160 --> 38:46.960
that's disgusting yeah ah I'm not gonna brush my teeth where I pee I'll see you

38:46.960 --> 38:51.740
might spit like toothpaste on your balls like what are you talking about you're

38:51.740 --> 38:54.880
gonna spit down and the water pressure is gonna push your spit back in your

38:54.880 --> 38:58.040
body and then you're gonna have toothpaste balls and you're gonna know

38:58.040 --> 39:02.960
that you did that you did that and here's the thing you drop your toothbrush

39:02.960 --> 39:06.200
in the sink accidentally oh that's fine you just pick it back up you keep going

39:06.200 --> 39:10.600
you drop your toothbrush in the shower you gotta get a new toothbrush it's a

39:10.600 --> 39:14.760
game changer you think that changes the game what I don't understand the game

39:14.760 --> 39:18.240
because suddenly your toothbrush is touched like the drain where all your

39:18.240 --> 39:23.400
hair goes and like all the water of your filthy life it is the most dangerous game

39:23.400 --> 39:29.000
that it's more dangerous than hunting men on a shipwreck aisle it is a game

39:29.000 --> 39:34.920
where if the drop of a single toothbrush is can mean total and complete calamity

39:34.920 --> 39:38.200
you gotta drive to target after that shit and it's labor if you're into that

39:38.200 --> 39:43.960
maybe you like the thrill of the threat yeah maybe you get your hands super

39:43.960 --> 39:51.160
super soapy and then what are you doing Jimbo you're on the

39:51.160 --> 40:00.600
edge step back man you're wearing a blindfold what are you doing your balls

40:00.600 --> 40:07.320
are covered in toothpaste you're not even in the shower just standing in the

40:07.320 --> 40:14.440
living room this has gone too far Jeff bridges and fearless gotta raid again you

40:14.440 --> 40:19.200
guys want to Yahoo answer yeah sure yeah that's not weird for some reason oh it's

40:19.200 --> 40:22.160

40:36.720 --> 40:40.620
one's gonna be able to give you any like satisfying answer to that no the

40:40.620 --> 40:43.800

Metal Gear Solid because we both love it and it actually brought us closer

41:23.360 --> 41:27.400
together but here's the sitch we need help with ideas and stuff invitations

41:27.400 --> 41:31.640
decorations the cake colors all that crap what should we do I know the game

41:31.640 --> 41:34.840
revolves around military stuff but we're not planning a military wedding we need

41:34.840 --> 41:38.760
more than that what budget should we set for please any ideas will be appreciated

41:38.760 --> 41:43.160
just be nice please thanks again this person fucking knows what's about to

41:43.160 --> 41:48.480
come down on them step one cardboard box to walk down the aisle I think that's

41:48.480 --> 41:52.760
pretty I think they probably figured that one out themselves okay can you

41:52.760 --> 41:58.120
imagine can you imagine no fuck that a little your little ring bear you put

41:58.120 --> 42:04.280
your little ring bear in a box as he walks down the aisle and throws rings

42:04.280 --> 42:09.240
well if it's Metal Gear Solid he'll have to throw like a hundred flying roses

42:09.240 --> 42:13.200
that are sparkling yeah throw those at the holes in the cardboard box he drops

42:13.200 --> 42:18.040
a chaff grenade and your dad who's filming is like hey dude we gotta wait

42:18.040 --> 42:22.400
like fucking 15 minutes for all this goddamn chaff to wear off reset the

42:22.400 --> 42:29.120
wedding please reset the Metal Gear wedding start again try oh so he's taking

42:29.120 --> 42:32.880
like a non-lethal approach to his wedding basically if he doesn't want a

42:32.880 --> 42:39.560
bunch of guns he wants like the the the more emotional side of Metal Gear yeah

42:39.560 --> 42:50.200
Travis have you yourself played a Metal Gear game I've played of it I've been

42:50.200 --> 42:57.880
around others whilst they played can you imagine can you imagine how surprised

42:57.880 --> 43:01.120
your bride is gonna be when the doors opens and it turns out she's marrying

43:01.120 --> 43:06.200
Raiden that's gonna be such a switch I think only the only thing I have in the

43:06.200 --> 43:11.600
chamber for this is a joke about like on the first night of the honeymoon giving

43:11.600 --> 43:15.360
her the old solid snake well that's just like the name of the guy in the thing

43:15.360 --> 43:19.280
but I know but his leg also like a penis that's pretty that's pretty general

43:19.280 --> 43:22.120
try it'd be like if we said they were doing a Jurassic Park theme wedding and

43:22.120 --> 43:26.560
you're like what if it was a dinosaur but my joke was like his penis is like a

43:26.560 --> 43:31.640
solid snake well then okay well what if after they had sex 30 times he'd look

43:31.640 --> 43:39.640
down at his penis and said boy my dinosaur that's solid goof what is this

43:39.640 --> 43:44.520
series known for I think we can I think the I think we gotta get the ceremony to

43:44.520 --> 43:48.360
last like 12 hours I think it's gonna include a few super esoteric

43:48.360 --> 43:54.920
geopolitical messages about you know the nuclear proliferation I think I believe

43:54.920 --> 43:58.160
there are also things about like long-lost brothers that's a given well

43:58.160 --> 44:01.480
genetic cloning I think that there's probably a few fun ways if you could get

44:01.480 --> 44:06.240
like twins is your flower girls and then Mario shows up well travel okay well

44:06.240 --> 44:10.840
hold on now you're doing a Smash Brothers theme holy fucking shit it's

44:10.840 --> 44:14.520
crash bandicoot knees objective is it too late to crash when kids never been

44:14.520 --> 44:21.440
especially is it too late to alter the theme the super super special no to I

44:21.440 --> 44:30.400
mean like to a normal wedding is it too late it's are you so invested in this

44:30.400 --> 44:35.680
you can't jump out now someone's fucking neck is gonna get broken and it's gonna

44:35.680 --> 44:42.720
be immersive I guess it's also gonna be pretty felonious and that fans are gonna

44:42.720 --> 44:46.240
be so disappointed when it turns out Kiefer Sutherland is officiating the

44:46.240 --> 44:51.320
wedding do you want to say that sentence out loud again and like hear it hear

44:51.320 --> 44:55.800
yourself saying it no you're right that doesn't make any sense no one's ever

44:55.800 --> 44:58.960
walked out of anything going ah fuck turned out it was just keepers that was

44:58.960 --> 45:02.080
just Kiefer Sutherland except for I guess that hotel manager it was cut

45:02.080 --> 45:06.440
super drunk and ran and tackled the Christmas tree YouTube it fucking the

45:06.440 --> 45:12.580
best the best the best thing second only to the male model picking the guy up off

45:12.580 --> 45:16.360
the stairs on the NTN the order is male model picks the other male model number

45:16.360 --> 45:20.720
one obviously everyone burned the building down people died because of

45:20.720 --> 45:24.160
that amazing moment number two but they understood why Kiefer Sutherland being

45:24.160 --> 45:27.920
interviewed on camera and the guy was like what's the secret Kiefer he's like

45:27.920 --> 45:34.480
you just gonna enjoy life run tackle tree falls Christmas over Christmas

45:34.480 --> 45:39.600
ruined if you if the camera panned like 30 degrees to the right you would see

45:39.600 --> 45:46.200
like that male model as a child I'm gonna fucking I'm gonna beat this beat

45:46.200 --> 45:51.840
this moment you have raised the game to an unimaginable level so that's gonna do

45:51.840 --> 45:54.280
