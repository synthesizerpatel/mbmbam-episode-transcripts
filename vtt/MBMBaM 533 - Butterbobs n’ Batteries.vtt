00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.160
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:48.160 --> 00:52.320
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.720
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.720 --> 01:05.440
Um, McElroy. A little bit of lag. You did get me on that. You got me on that one.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.400
Ah, thanks.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.440
You did get me on that one. So I wanted to start,

01:10.320 --> 01:13.920
you know, I hate to do it, but I gotta start a little political.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.080
Aw, man. Again, Justin?

01:16.080 --> 01:17.600
Did you say buh-litical?

01:20.160 --> 01:22.160
And then to eat some bas-ketty.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.320
Time for ball-o-ticks.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.480
Thanks. So I did a tweet.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.840
There's your first mistake.

01:27.840 --> 01:32.560
I did a tweet, um, cause I wanted, cause a question, I had like a hypothetical question,

01:33.600 --> 01:38.960
and I needed answers, right? And so I put this hypothetical out to the internet,

01:38.960 --> 01:47.040
and it received, before voting closed, 34,913 replies.

01:47.040 --> 01:47.360
Oh wow.

01:47.360 --> 01:53.120
And I want to dig into this, and it got so much of a response, I wanted to dig into this question

01:53.120 --> 01:57.600
with you guys, and really talk through some of the data, if that's okay.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.520
Did you get ratioed, as the teens say?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.840
I don't think so. I don't think it's a ratio.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.400
Teens are fucking wild about fractions, I guess, and I'm just stoked.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.960
People are always talking about like, it's just phones, phones, phones, phones,

02:10.960 --> 02:15.040
but they're out here talking about ratios and Pythagoras.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.680
I thought it was radio like patio.

02:17.680 --> 02:18.160
Okay.

02:18.160 --> 02:18.720
All right.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.840
So here's the tweet.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.480
Okay.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.200
That's the tweet.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.120
Here's the tweet.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.600
I got a new hypothetical that's going to sweep the nation,

02:25.600 --> 02:28.000
and add some sparkle to your next Zoom happy hour.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.000
And here's it, and I want to pose it to you, my brothers.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.960
If you could, consequence free,

02:35.840 --> 02:40.400
spank Donald J. Trump, right on his behind, on national TV,

02:41.200 --> 02:46.400
would you do it, please think, before answering.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.040
If you're about to start talking, I know you haven't thought about it.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.680
No, I have, bare ass, question mark.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.720
Bare ass, bare hand, skin to skin, contact is so important.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.920
This is data.

02:57.920 --> 03:06.560
I can't, I can't shift the parameters of the question for you.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.120
This is the question that is put before you.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.440
You do not have more information than this.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.360
Any God-fearing American trap, I think, is thinking about bare ass, bare hand.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.800
I don't think there's anybody who thought about spanking this gentleman with his pants on,

03:18.800 --> 03:22.080
not for the stuff he's accomplished.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.480
No, sir, you do deserve a bare ass spanking.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.840
You know what, let me say this.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.960
I'll, you know what, I will, I will, since we're outside the,

03:30.960 --> 03:32.640
let me give you this data.

03:32.640 --> 03:32.960
Okay.

03:32.960 --> 03:38.240
With that, with that data, okay, before we drill down onto your personal responses,

03:38.240 --> 03:41.280
with that data, the internet said,

03:41.280 --> 03:44.480
44% of internet respondents said, okay.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.360
Oh.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.800
56% of internet respondents said, no, thanks.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.040
So that's where, that data, that's the data.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.640
And I don't know if people thought about it enough,

03:56.640 --> 03:57.920
because a lot of people were like,

03:59.120 --> 04:02.400
I think I'd catch some sort of slime disease from his butt.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.040
It's like, that's all very funny, but I'm trying to, I'm trying to do research,

04:07.040 --> 04:08.400
and that's probably not gonna happen.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.200
Is it funny?

04:09.840 --> 04:11.040
Is it funny?

04:11.040 --> 04:14.080
It's not that long ago that this gentleman did have the corona.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.720
And if I said gentleman, I meant scoundrel.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.000
Here's what I will say.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.920
I got a big old flat hand.

04:19.920 --> 04:20.560
Oh God.

04:20.560 --> 04:26.240
And I believe I could deliver a spanking as such

04:26.240 --> 04:33.600
that it would go beyond embarrassing if I really put my full torque into it.

04:33.600 --> 04:33.920
Right.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.080
Into potentially damaging.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.840
Okay, you can't, this is important,

04:37.840 --> 04:44.720
because if the spank damages the body of the man that is the president of the country,

04:45.280 --> 04:49.680
then we are getting into some, let's call it, questionable legal territory.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.040
Okay, now hold on, Justin.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.760
I, you didn't give further details.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.240
So I was assuming in this scenario, this is a purely consensual thing

04:58.240 --> 05:00.320
where Donald J. Trump-

05:00.320 --> 05:01.920
It's not consensual.

05:01.920 --> 05:02.960
Then I wouldn't do it.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.720
There just won't be repercussions.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.160
Then it, then I, okay.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.840
Then there's not going to be repercussions.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.600
Listen, he's not gonna-

05:11.600 --> 05:16.320
No, you asked the question and now you're not listening to me, sir.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.560
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.480
I did not, I did not.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.640
The energy is just so bad.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.800
This is still my time, sir, if I may.

05:25.680 --> 05:30.080
I have to assume he is in some kind of stocks scenario.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.280
And this has like been his preordained punishment.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.160
And someone said, do you wanna like go to prison or get a spanking?

05:36.160 --> 05:37.920
And he was like, oh, of course the spanking.

05:38.560 --> 05:44.800
And here I come with my big old, like two by nine of a hand or whatever.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.640
Gonna fucking panini that ass.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.680
Yeah, and I come in there and he's like, I wish I had picked jail.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.400
This is what I'm saying is I think I could deliver-

05:52.400 --> 05:54.640
Cause my butt's a manhole cover now.

05:54.640 --> 06:00.400
Yes, I think I could flatten him in such a way to make his butt concave.

06:00.400 --> 06:04.160
Fucking Everlong over here just smashed my ass out of the galaxy.

06:04.160 --> 06:09.600
I think that it would seem like a better alternative for him

06:09.600 --> 06:11.040
than whatever other punishment.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.240
But then here I come in and shatter his coccyx.

06:14.240 --> 06:22.240
But I don't think, I don't wanna do it if it is the only repercussion

06:22.240 --> 06:26.560
that he gets for his, again, many, many bad accomplishments.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.440
Because that feels like letting him off lightly.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.760
And I also don't know if that is gonna be the punishment,

06:31.760 --> 06:34.640
if I should be the one to do it.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.640
I can think of many more people who have been more severely affected

06:38.640 --> 06:40.160
by his administration than myself.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.000
And so I would, if given the opportunity,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.560
I would almost certainly hand it down to somebody more deserving.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.480
Well, okay, you don't have that opportunity.

06:46.480 --> 06:51.520
You literally just have the president bent over and everyone,

06:51.520 --> 06:54.560
and like the nation is watching, the cameras are on.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.960
The secret service is like, we don't enjoy him.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.600
We'll give you one.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.440
They turn away for like a little bit.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.240
Right, exactly.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.480
Blind eye, no repercussions.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.640
And like, here's what I would like to say

07:06.640 --> 07:08.800
that I don't think he does see it coming.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.120
I think he bent over to pick up a dime.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.160
And his pants fell down?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.840
And his pants fell down and there's his butt?

07:14.960 --> 07:17.120
See, I never, this is what's interesting.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.800
Author intent, I never anticipated bare ass.

07:20.800 --> 07:25.600
Well then no, see, if it's not bare ass, Justin, it's not embarrassing.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.040
Now I'm just a weirdo who ran up and spanked someone.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.640
That's such a wild thing to say,

07:31.280 --> 07:38.000
because the nation would have the visual of him getting spanked.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.440
But if it's his bare bottom, it's like he's a big baby

07:41.440 --> 07:43.520
and I'm spanking his big baby bottom.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.840
But if he's betrousered,

07:45.840 --> 07:49.280
then it doesn't have the same visual effect, Justin.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.360
Are we talking about hitting the president?

07:52.880 --> 07:55.280
No, that's why it has to be a spanking.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.920
And it can't be throughout his injurious spanking.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.320
The spank is a fucking hit, dog.

08:02.320 --> 08:06.400
The three of us hold the same opinions vis-a-vis spanking

08:06.960 --> 08:11.120
as being a pretty heinous thing and it is hitting.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.760
So we are talking about doing a hit on the president.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.600
There are two categories of spanking.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.520
There is consensual spanking,

08:17.520 --> 08:22.560
betwixt partners who enjoy spanking one another or multiples.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.440
And then there is injurious spanking,

08:25.440 --> 08:27.520
where you are striking another human being

08:27.520 --> 08:29.360
with the flat of your open hand.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.200
Now, which one is it that we're talking about here, Justin?

08:33.200 --> 08:35.600
Sensual spanking or injurious spanking?

08:35.600 --> 08:39.280
I did say, now, if I could drill in on the language of the question,

08:39.280 --> 08:41.200
if you could consequence-free,

08:41.200 --> 08:44.480
I feel like injury would be a consequence.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.120
Not to me.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.720
I didn't say that.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.880
Didn't say that.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.320
Didn't say consequence-free to you.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.080
It's a consequence-free period to you and the spanky

08:54.080 --> 08:57.120
who is the president of the United States of America,

08:57.120 --> 08:58.960
our 45th Donald J. Trump.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.640
Justin, that's absolutely bullshit.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.440
That's wild, yeah.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.800
Because now I am having a neutral impact.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.520
It means I am so lightly touching his bottom

09:07.520 --> 09:10.560
that he might derive neither pain nor pleasure.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.600
Or in fact, it sounds like lasting effect of any kind.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
There's a causal sort of relationship

09:17.040 --> 09:22.240
between Travis's huge, huge ape hand swinging low

09:22.240 --> 09:26.160
like a big golf driver into our American president's butt.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.200
And he will feel it.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.160
If not, then it's like Travis is a ghost.

09:32.160 --> 09:36.480
Unless Justin is describing an Adam Sandler-esque scenario

09:36.480 --> 09:38.960
in which he went down to pick up some kind of diamond

09:38.960 --> 09:42.080
and I'm standing behind him pretending to smack that ass.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.320
No.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.320
It's more humiliating than that.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.680
Then he's gonna feel it.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.480
He's gonna feel it.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.760
I didn't say he wouldn't feel it.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.280
I said he wouldn't be injured.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.200
There wouldn't be a permanent butt injury.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.840
Because if I say, would you like to injure the president?

09:55.840 --> 09:59.440
Everybody on earth would say absolutely.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.320
I would love that.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.080
But that's not what I'm talking about.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.600
I'm talking about giving the president a big old spank

10:05.600 --> 10:08.800
right on his bottom as hard as you can, as hard as I can.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.440
You just said the words as hard as I can.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.520
It's gonna be bad for Travis to do it.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.800
I did just want to say real quick

10:14.800 --> 10:17.600
that I did mention ghosts, but ghosts are famously

10:18.480 --> 10:22.080
against spanking because they just don't stand

10:22.080 --> 10:23.920
for corporeal punishment.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.640
Would you?

10:24.640 --> 10:25.360
Wait, stop.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.160
Oh, boy.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.200
Oh, boy.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.040
Yes, I do think so, Griffin.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.720
I think, what are you guys making this data?

10:31.360 --> 10:37.440
56% of respondents would pass on the opportunity

10:37.440 --> 10:38.960
to spank the president.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.640
I will say, until I landed on, I want to hurt him

10:42.640 --> 10:43.680
with my strike.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.160
Then my first thought was, I do not want to be

10:46.160 --> 10:49.360
in the same room a lot of that energy, yes.

10:49.360 --> 10:49.860
Yeah.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.440
Yeah, I don't want to touch his bad butt.

10:53.440 --> 10:58.320
I'm thinking it's not, I'm not gonna body shame anybody,

10:58.320 --> 11:01.360
but it's not high on the list for me.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.160
You know what I mean?

11:02.160 --> 11:06.080
I actually also took a poll on Twitter on the 18th.

11:06.080 --> 11:11.680
I asked, irony aside, where are we at on The Greatest Showman?

11:11.680 --> 11:15.760
The Greatest Showman, and I got 11,000 responses.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.260
Okay.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.080
Do you guys want to guess, like, yay or nay,

11:20.080 --> 11:22.000
what the percentages were?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.560
It's got to be, I'm gonna say 70% yay,

11:24.560 --> 11:25.840
because America still has a heart.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.240
They have, or the globe, I guess, in this case,

11:28.240 --> 11:28.800
has a heart.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.680
They got a pulse.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.480
They're loving it.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.280
What about you, Griff?

11:33.200 --> 11:36.240
Yeah, I haven't seen the film because it seems so bad.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.000
It was almost completely split down the middle.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.640
52% yes, 48% no.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.280
Incorrect.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.600
So more people enjoy, unironically, The Greatest Showman

11:45.600 --> 11:47.840
than want to strike the president's bottom.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.760
Yeah, I got a Twitter poll out there, and it says,

11:49.760 --> 11:52.640
bye guys, I'm off to see Deadpool 2 in theaters

11:53.520 --> 11:57.200
because it has been so long since I did a tweet.

11:57.200 --> 12:03.280
So if anyone ever asks you what is a perfectly average neutral movie,

12:03.280 --> 12:04.320
it's The Greatest Showman.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.800
It almost perfectly cancels out.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.200
Half the people do not like it.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.720
Half the people like it.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.120
Greatest Showman, right down the middle.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.680
That actually was the tagline of Greatest Showman,

12:15.680 --> 12:16.560
right down the middle.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.000
That wasn't really germane to my intro.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I think you just wanted to change the subject.

12:22.000 --> 12:22.480
I did.

12:22.480 --> 12:27.600
I was sick of talking about either attacking the American president.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.880
Can I just get a yay or nay real quick?

12:30.160 --> 12:33.360
Given the opportunity, the consequence-free,

12:33.360 --> 12:35.440
with the American people watching,

12:35.440 --> 12:37.280
is that in the text of the tweet, Justin,

12:37.280 --> 12:38.240
the American people watching?

12:38.240 --> 12:39.760
It's on national TV.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.600
But America has the right to tune in.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.360
This is a huge opportunity then,

12:45.360 --> 12:47.120
because I'll get on there and whatever,

12:47.120 --> 12:49.920
spank his ass or his bad ass or whatever.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.520
And then when I'm doing it, I could be like,

12:51.520 --> 12:53.200
and here's the link to my mixtape.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.320
And I can say it out loud.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.120
Yeah, check out my sound file.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.320
My brother, my brother and me,

12:56.320 --> 12:58.480
go check it at McElroyFamily.com.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.600
Check out my shows.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.000
Should be good for our iTunes reviews.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.440
Should be a good journey we'd go on as a result of that.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.600
Negative three stars.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.720
I'm not gonna listen to this.

13:11.760 --> 13:17.200
Dr. Skinhead 420XX says it shows snowflake garbage.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.360
Justin, I kind of feel like I already did smack Donald Trump's ass

13:21.360 --> 13:23.440
because I voted for Joe Biden early,

13:24.000 --> 13:25.920
which I recommend everybody do.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.000
I mean, you can do that.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.480
But there's only one spank, you know what I mean?

13:30.480 --> 13:32.320
You only have one spank opportunity.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.880
I was trying to take whatever this has been

13:34.880 --> 13:38.320
and spin it in some kind of thing.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.720
Vote for Joe Biden early.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.280
It's gonna be fucking crazy on voting day.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.200
Get your shit in now.

13:45.200 --> 13:45.840
Go in now.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.520
Vote for Joe Biden.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.720
Don't hit people.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.720
Spanking doesn't help raise children.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.160
But if I had the opportunity, yes, Justin,

13:54.720 --> 13:56.080
I would smack that ass.

13:56.640 --> 13:57.140
Okay.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.880
I would give just Gordon Bynes tight little keister a go.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.360
That's in no way German.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.800
That would be a smack, but that would be a spank of pleasure.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.120
Yeah, no, that's just like a little good game, bud.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.880
Good going, bud.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.120
Way to get elected president, bud.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.080
Good going, bud.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.000
Let's tighten up those policies just a bit, bud.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.760
Let me nudge them.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.520
You don't need to do the fracking if you think about it.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.880
There's room to improve, bud.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.880
I'm gonna tap your left butt cheek, Joe.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.080
That tight left butt.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.440
You follow that tap.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.520
Just to let you know that that's the direction.

14:31.520 --> 14:36.960
You should maybe angle it towards it, Joey.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.680
Hey, maybe a single spanker healthcare.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.800
I mean, yeah, that's right, Justin.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.440
Yeah.

14:43.440 --> 14:43.760
Yeah.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.400
Okay.

14:44.400 --> 14:48.000
So this is a advice show that runs a little bit political.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.880
Well, we are not gonna have an episode next week,

14:52.880 --> 14:53.920
the week of the election.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.080
So we got to get all that shit out of our system now.

14:56.080 --> 14:56.560
There you go.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.600
Go vote for Joe Biden.

14:57.600 --> 15:02.720
And if you care about anything, and you can.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.800
Like, obviously, if you're in England, you don't need it.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.520
So, I mean, I get it.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.320
So.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.120
Oh, man, we could have talked about Borat.

15:11.120 --> 15:11.920
Fuck.

15:11.920 --> 15:12.160
Fuck.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.240
Yeah, that sucks.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.400
Because Borat's like, it's funny.

15:17.200 --> 15:22.800
It's funny how Borat, by making him relevant again,

15:22.800 --> 15:24.960
made him irrelevant to us.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.600
Yeah, he does.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.160
But making Borat relevant is now irrelevant

15:30.160 --> 15:31.200
from a comedy perspective.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.480
Justin, can you give us a 21 my wife salute?

15:34.480 --> 15:37.520
Just to see that phrase off your soundboard.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.320
Yeah.

15:38.320 --> 15:38.800
Just play that.

15:38.800 --> 15:43.200
My wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.000
It's not 21.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.760
That's six.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.320
That's six.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.640
We'll do 15 more throughout the show, I'm sure.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.280
Okay.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.000
I'm gonna miss it.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.440
It's just not funny no more.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.880
It's not funny anymore.

15:52.880 --> 15:53.120
Yeah.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.720
It's not funny anymore.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.720
God, I hope they don't reboot Frasier.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.400
Please don't take that away from us.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.280
Please.

15:59.280 --> 16:03.600
Like, I know we've said AP4 and we would get there day one

16:03.600 --> 16:05.040
in theaters, but please don't.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.840
Please, Mike, don't get AP4 in theaters.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.560
Please, bud.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.360
This is an advice show.

16:11.360 --> 16:15.440
And now it's time to answer a question.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.120
The office I work at is having a Halloween party

16:19.120 --> 16:20.160
with a costume contest.

16:20.160 --> 16:20.880
Nice.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.760
Prizes for said contest are first place gets a month's paid rent.

16:25.760 --> 16:26.000
What?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.160
Second place gets a paid vacation anywhere

16:28.160 --> 16:29.440
in the continental United States.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.400
What the fuck?

16:30.400 --> 16:31.840
Third place is you're fired.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.760
Weirdly, every place after third place is just no prize.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.080
But if you get, for whatever reason, second runner up,

16:40.080 --> 16:41.760
hit the fucking bricks, dude.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.320
Now, I don't mean to brag, but I've had some luck

16:44.320 --> 16:45.760
with costume contests in the past

16:45.760 --> 16:47.520
and I have confidence that I could win.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.040
However, I do not live in a place that charges rent

16:51.040 --> 16:52.640
and I'd really love a vacation.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.760
Oh, my God.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.680
Brothers, what costume should I wear

16:55.680 --> 16:58.240
to guarantee second place?

16:59.040 --> 17:01.680
That's from haphazardlyhappyhalloween in Houston.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.960
This is an amazing, amazing, amazing question.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.200
That's really so friggin' difficult.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.760
This feels like a fucking Taskmaster challenge.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.080
Yeah.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.760
Yeah, because there's a worry here

17:11.760 --> 17:14.000
that if you underplay it too much,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.080
you don't play second, right?

17:16.080 --> 17:17.680
Like, yeah.

17:17.680 --> 17:17.920
Yeah.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.560
Okay, here's where my gut is at.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.000
If there's somebody in the office

17:26.000 --> 17:32.160
who is going to do something very intricate

17:32.160 --> 17:35.680
and very technical, but maybe not the most creative thing,

17:36.320 --> 17:39.200
but they would feel guilty not giving them first place,

17:39.920 --> 17:42.640
then you need to clock in just below that.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.240
So maybe you do a really funny, clever costume,

17:46.240 --> 17:48.160
but not one that is necessarily

17:48.160 --> 17:50.320
technically artistically proficient.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.840
I was thinking the same thing,

17:51.840 --> 17:54.480
but here's the trick with that, Griffin,

17:54.480 --> 17:57.520
is if the joke ends up landing too well,

17:58.240 --> 18:00.080
now you're a crowd favorite

18:00.080 --> 18:03.840
and it's like, well, it's not as good technically,

18:03.840 --> 18:06.720
but it's bringing the most joy to everybody.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.560
I think we know who the winner is.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.680
Well, then you flip it, right?

18:09.680 --> 18:10.640
Then you do the other one.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.000
You just gotta know your office

18:12.000 --> 18:14.160
and know are they gonna reward creativity

18:14.160 --> 18:16.160
or are they gonna reward the fact

18:16.160 --> 18:18.480
that you dressed up like fucking Kim Bone again

18:18.480 --> 18:19.760
for the fourth year in a row?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.600
Man, I hope they know it.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.800
You could go as the fly on Pence's hair, right?

18:24.800 --> 18:25.300
Funny!

18:26.080 --> 18:26.320
Funny!

18:26.320 --> 18:27.600
I'll see, but right there,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.200
that reaction from you guys

18:29.200 --> 18:33.440
trumps Jerry's photorealistic Transformers outfit.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.640
Yeah, yeah.

18:34.640 --> 18:39.120
Okay, all right, here's what I got for you.

18:39.120 --> 18:39.360
Okay.

18:39.360 --> 18:44.880
Okay, you need to create

18:44.880 --> 18:51.600
an incredibly accurate, detailed costume.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.160
Okay.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.040
I'm gonna choose for this example, Captain Jack Sparrow.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.600
So you do the perfect Captain Jack Sparrow look, right?

19:00.240 --> 19:03.680
And then you go into the office the night before

19:04.720 --> 19:07.120
and you sleep in the bathroom.

19:07.120 --> 19:07.920
Okay.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.680
Okay, when people come in,

19:09.680 --> 19:12.800
they're gonna change into their costume in the bathroom, right?

19:13.360 --> 19:15.280
And I need you to keep an eye on...

19:16.800 --> 19:18.480
Them in the bathroom, Justin?

19:18.480 --> 19:19.040
What?

19:19.040 --> 19:20.800
Them in the bathroom, is that what you're saying?

19:20.800 --> 19:23.840
Keep an eye on people coming and going from the bathroom.

19:23.840 --> 19:24.400
Okay.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.280
When you see the person who has the best costume,

19:27.920 --> 19:29.840
it won't be as richly detailed

19:29.840 --> 19:32.480
as your Captain Jack Sparrow costume, of course.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.680
That's important.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.520
They can't naturally beat you.

19:35.520 --> 19:39.200
But then you can start to remove items from your costume

19:39.760 --> 19:41.520
to get you so right.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.560
So like, maybe you just are gonna remove

19:44.560 --> 19:46.240
a few of the beads from your hair.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.360
You know, maybe you're gonna get the red band...

19:49.360 --> 19:50.960
You'll leave the tricorner,

19:50.960 --> 19:53.600
but you won't have that distinctive red bandana

19:53.600 --> 19:54.880
under the tricorner.

19:54.880 --> 19:55.680
You see what I'm saying?

19:55.680 --> 19:57.040
Yes.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.720
Your eyeliner.

19:58.720 --> 19:59.600
Get rid of the eyeliner.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.400
No, please don't.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.600
You can't lose the eyeliner or I'll just be a pirate, Justin.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.480
It's just a bad office.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.320
I mean, like, if you have to lose the eyeliner,

20:06.320 --> 20:07.760
it's a bad office that you work in.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.960
And you should probably, honestly,

20:08.960 --> 20:11.600
your real answer is you need to find a new job.

20:11.600 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.960
If no one can beat...

20:14.160 --> 20:16.160
If you have to take off the eyeliner,

20:16.160 --> 20:18.960
like, what are they bringing to this?

20:18.960 --> 20:19.440
You know?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.600
Like, what are they even doing?

20:21.600 --> 20:22.800
Now, what you could also do

20:23.680 --> 20:25.360
is the day before the party,

20:26.240 --> 20:29.280
start talking about what a rough time Jerry's having.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.240
Yes, yes.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.280
Like, just spread around.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.040
Jerry's having a hard time.

20:33.040 --> 20:37.440
You know, he just hasn't been clicking for Jerry lately.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.920
And then when the contest comes,

20:39.920 --> 20:42.640
just keep, like, pointing at Jerry

20:42.640 --> 20:44.240
and nodding to everybody, right?

20:44.240 --> 20:44.560
Yeah.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.480
Or even better, if you win.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.120
Yes.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.400
Then you're just like, no.

20:48.400 --> 20:48.720
Yes.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.160
I'll take second.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.600
Jerry needs this.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.880
Look at that very funny...

20:53.760 --> 20:56.080
Look at Jerry's funny Kim Bone costume.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.440
He's got the red sweater.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.960
You know what kind of year he's having?

20:58.960 --> 21:01.600
Let's hear it for our first responders.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.560
Jerry, what?

21:02.560 --> 21:03.760
Wait, what did you say?

21:03.760 --> 21:06.800
Let's hear it for our frontline workers.

21:06.800 --> 21:07.680
Jerry's not...

21:07.680 --> 21:09.360
This is a fucking Staples.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.240
No, Jerry.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.520
Yeah, what are you talking about?

21:11.520 --> 21:12.800
Jerry unloads the truck.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.360
Yeah, but I think we all know that of everyone on Earth,

21:17.360 --> 21:19.600
this year has been hardest on Jerry.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.840
Now, I'm gonna challenge your suggestion

21:21.840 --> 21:24.800
that Staples employees are not essential workers.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.160
But now more than ever, we're working out of the home

21:28.160 --> 21:30.000
and we need mice.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.520
We need floor mats.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.280
We need post-it notes.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.120
I don't even know what toner does,

21:35.120 --> 21:37.040
but I don't wanna work without it.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.040
I wanna say thank you to our Staples employees.

21:39.040 --> 21:42.480
Office, Max, Office Depot, fuck off.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.520
I'm going to Staples.

21:43.520 --> 21:43.840
That's right.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.280
Now, sorry.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.560
I liked that Staples started with one product

21:48.560 --> 21:50.320
and expanded from there.

21:50.320 --> 21:50.800
It's bold.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.440
I'm just saying that

21:51.440 --> 21:53.200
because we don't have a Staples in Huntington.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.040
Oh, you poor bastards.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.560
I know, I know.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.880
I'm still team, hashtag RadioShack.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.720
Yeah, we're coming back.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.520
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

22:02.320 --> 22:04.960
There's a RadioShack next to the Long John Silver's

22:04.960 --> 22:05.840
on 5th Avenue.

22:05.840 --> 22:06.400
You guys know?

22:06.400 --> 22:06.640
What?

22:06.640 --> 22:07.920
Down there, Huntington East.

22:07.920 --> 22:08.320
Yes.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.120
Right near the Magic Walk.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.520
I bought some exotic batteries from there once.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.000
Yeah, now both the Long John Silver's

22:14.000 --> 22:15.440
and the RadioShack close

22:15.440 --> 22:18.000
and it's just two abandoned fossils

22:18.000 --> 22:18.880
right next to each other.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.000
It's really a sad.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.200
You think they're gonna combine,

22:21.200 --> 22:22.080
lift each other up.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.760
That's what I was gonna say is,

22:23.760 --> 22:24.640
do you think they could have,

22:24.640 --> 22:26.160
if they had just made it work,

22:26.160 --> 22:27.200
like, please.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.200
See, if Long John Silver's

22:29.200 --> 22:30.960
had had any fucking foresight,

22:30.960 --> 22:31.760
they would have been like,

22:31.760 --> 22:33.520
listen, man, I know you're going through a hard time,

22:33.520 --> 22:35.120
you can crash at our building,

22:35.120 --> 22:36.000
just go to the back

22:36.000 --> 22:36.960
and there's a little RadioShack.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.600
Come on down to Long Radio John Shack

22:39.600 --> 22:42.480
and we are gonna treat you to batteries and cod.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.640
Deep fried batteries, six for $4.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.840
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.920
Griffin, you know fish at Long John Silver's

22:49.920 --> 22:51.600
is not of any discernible species.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.360
Yeah, come get this chopped,

22:53.360 --> 22:55.200
reconstituted fish product

22:55.200 --> 22:57.200
and get some free loose wires.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.240
No, no, I forgot that.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.920
This is gonna feel like a Munch Squad,

22:59.920 --> 23:01.520
but Long John Silver's, I've noticed,

23:02.080 --> 23:02.960
has been trying,

23:03.840 --> 23:04.800
I drive past their sign,

23:04.800 --> 23:05.520
the one on Route 60

23:05.520 --> 23:06.720
when I'm going to the liquor store,

23:06.720 --> 23:08.800
and they've been trying increasingly

23:09.920 --> 23:11.200
like highfalutin

23:13.440 --> 23:14.320
seafood meals.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.440
And the funny thing about it is

23:15.440 --> 23:17.680
the more they aspire,

23:18.560 --> 23:20.400
the more repellent it is.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.680
Like the harder they go,

23:22.480 --> 23:24.320
the less appetizing it is.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.280
Like when they're like,

23:25.280 --> 23:28.480
we got a lobster roll now.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.880
Like I don't think you actually do.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.960
I don't think I will be doing that

23:32.960 --> 23:34.320
with you right now.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.840
This is the worst part.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.640
On this show,

23:37.440 --> 23:38.960
every time we talk about

23:38.960 --> 23:41.040
any kind of fast food,

23:41.760 --> 23:43.840
I want it so bad now.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.680
I would crush some Long John Silver's.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.120
Y'all are acting above your raise

23:47.120 --> 23:48.560
and fucking Long John Silver's

23:48.560 --> 23:50.640
used to be a special fucking treat

23:50.640 --> 23:52.160
for us on our way to church.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.080
Most of the time we get the Taco Bell,

23:54.080 --> 23:55.600
but then like, you know,

23:55.600 --> 23:56.560
when we did good,

23:56.560 --> 23:57.840
Grey's on our report card,

23:57.840 --> 23:59.280
we take it to Long John Silver's,

23:59.280 --> 24:01.840
get some free crispy stripums.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.480
Sometimes mom would let me,

24:04.480 --> 24:06.320
once I discovered that I could order

24:06.320 --> 24:07.440
a side of Crunchies,

24:09.200 --> 24:10.480
she would do it

24:10.480 --> 24:12.080
and then be disgusted with me,

24:12.080 --> 24:13.200
which I used to love.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.640
Justin, you say Crunchies.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.000
Do you mean the little bits and bobs

24:18.000 --> 24:19.760
of batter that just floated around

24:19.760 --> 24:21.040
in the oil for a long time?

24:21.040 --> 24:21.840
Batter bobs.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.440
Batter bobs, Crunchies.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.560
I mean, whatever you call them,

24:25.120 --> 24:26.640
you can order a side of them.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.520
They don't give a fuck.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.200
Come on down to Long Radio, John Shaq.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.680
We got batter bobs and batteries.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.280
Do you guys want a Yahoo, please?

24:33.280 --> 24:33.600
Yeah, I'd love that.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.880
Sent by Graham Roebuck, thank you.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.040
It's a Yahoo user who is anonymous

24:37.040 --> 24:38.320
because they're afraid of me.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.240
But I'm going to call them.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.480
Davis asks,

24:42.480 --> 24:44.400
I feel like I use that fucking name a lot, huh?

24:45.840 --> 24:49.040
If humans had beaks instead of noses,

24:49.840 --> 24:50.960
would we still kiss?

24:50.960 --> 24:52.640
Okay, so kissing is weird, right?

24:52.640 --> 24:53.600
If you think about it.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.320
Are you saying that or is Davis saying that?

24:56.320 --> 24:57.600
Davis is saying that.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.560
I would never say that.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.560
You know I love to kiss.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.520
Yes, I do.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.360
But we do it and we like it.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.760
But would we, even if we had beaks,

25:05.760 --> 25:07.040
how would we kiss then?

25:07.040 --> 25:08.480
Why don't birds kiss?

25:09.280 --> 25:11.840
How do you fucking know they don't, Davis?

25:11.840 --> 25:12.160
Yeah.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.240
Maybe they're just not into PDAs.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.200
Maybe birds wait until they're at home in private

25:17.200 --> 25:18.800
to do the bird smooching.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.440
And they make up for lost time if you know

25:22.160 --> 25:22.960
while I'm playing.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.960
Yeah, maybe birds just don't like foreplay.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.360
Maybe just like across the board,

25:27.360 --> 25:29.600
all birds are like, listen, if we're smooching,

25:29.600 --> 25:30.720
we could be boning.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.600
Yeah.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.480
We have hollow bones and we only live for like six days

25:34.480 --> 25:34.960
or whatever.

25:34.960 --> 25:35.920
Travis doesn't know.

25:35.920 --> 25:41.040
Wow, they don't live as long as we do.

25:41.040 --> 25:41.760
Certainly not.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.320
Yeah, so six days is a pretty good estimate,

25:44.320 --> 25:46.160
I think, of their age.

25:46.160 --> 25:50.800
My point is that we as human beings could live upwards

25:50.800 --> 25:52.800
of, I believe, 112 years.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.480
That's what I'm aiming for.

25:54.480 --> 25:58.160
And so we look at every other animal's habits

25:58.160 --> 26:00.320
through that lens and we're like, why aren't they?

26:00.320 --> 26:00.640
Blah, blah, blah.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.040
And it's like, well, you know, that bird is like,

26:03.040 --> 26:04.560
I don't have time for kissing.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.080
Are you kidding me?

26:06.080 --> 26:07.920
I got 10 years, dude.

26:07.920 --> 26:08.640
That's possible.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.760
So there's a thing in this question

26:11.760 --> 26:13.680
I didn't notice until just now.

26:13.680 --> 26:16.960
I didn't notice until just now.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.880
And this is the question.

26:18.880 --> 26:22.240
If humans had beaks instead of noses, would we still kiss?

26:22.240 --> 26:26.240
Does this presuppose that we would still have our mouths?

26:27.760 --> 26:31.760
But then instead of our nose, we would have a beak there?

26:31.760 --> 26:33.680
So we'd have a sort of mouth stack?

26:34.560 --> 26:37.360
I simply can't believe that that's true, Griffin,

26:37.360 --> 26:41.280
because that crosses into a level of horror

26:41.280 --> 26:45.920
that I believe goes beyond like logistically,

26:45.920 --> 26:47.600
like, could we still kiss?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.840
But then again, it does say, would we still kiss?

26:49.840 --> 26:53.040
Okay, but yes, listen, this is Halloween, baby.

26:53.040 --> 26:57.440
Ooh, you could do a kiss with both your mouths

26:57.440 --> 27:01.360
at the same time, or there would probably be people

27:01.360 --> 27:02.880
who would want to flip it upside down,

27:02.880 --> 27:05.120
do a little mouth to mouth to mouth to mouth,

27:05.120 --> 27:08.960
sort of 69 situation, person on bird on person on bird.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.960
It's just called 11s at that point.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.000
It's they do 11s with the bird mouths.

27:16.000 --> 27:16.960
I feel like that would be bad

27:16.960 --> 27:19.360
because your bird mouth would have to eat worms.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.080
Well, let me put it this way, Griffin.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.920
Let me add another layer to this question.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.280
What if you replaced human beings noses with beaks,

27:27.280 --> 27:29.920
but beaks that they were not in control of,

27:29.920 --> 27:31.120
would you still kiss?

27:31.120 --> 27:33.280
Oh, so like I would go in and be like,

27:33.280 --> 27:36.240
do you, Griffin, you may now kiss the bride.

27:36.240 --> 27:44.560
Like I had no control over, please, this is my special day.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.800
Please calm down, beak nose.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.880
But then that's wild because the whole audience

27:48.880 --> 27:50.560
for my rad wedding would just be like,

27:52.480 --> 27:54.960
you wouldn't go, you'd be able to go anywhere.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.640
Well, okay, you can also fly.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.320
Ooh.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.160
This is, no, you can't fly.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.840
Well, there has to be some benefit.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.200
That's what this, you can't say-

28:03.200 --> 28:04.960
No more stinky smells.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.880
Yeah, but no more pleasant smells either, Griffin.

28:06.880 --> 28:10.880
You heard what I said about 69 with the bird mouths, right?

28:10.880 --> 28:11.680
Yeah, that's very good.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.440
That was very good.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.400
I think you might've missed that.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.760
And you could access grubs and stuff hidden inside of bark.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.280
I would appreciate that.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.320
Then let's just, let's return to the pleasant,

28:22.320 --> 28:25.920
less problematic waters of just one big bird mouth.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.360
You're a fucking, you're falco.

28:27.360 --> 28:30.320
You got a Baldwin, you got an Alec Baldwin from Beetlejuice.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.920
No, no, no, no, no.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.600
No, no, what?

28:35.600 --> 28:36.640
When I'm talking about a beak,

28:36.640 --> 28:40.480
you're imagining like a fucking crocodile maw

28:40.480 --> 28:42.080
that's like a foot and a half long.

28:42.080 --> 28:42.560
No, I'm-

28:42.560 --> 28:44.400
You're at like Zubeli Zoo territory.

28:44.400 --> 28:44.880
Yeah, that's no good.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.920
Oh, like a cute, we're talking like a chickadee's beak

28:47.920 --> 28:50.320
and not like a pelican or something.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.840
Yeah, right, what you just said.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.440
Do you think we would still be like into kissing?

28:57.440 --> 28:58.560
I don't think so.

28:58.560 --> 29:02.240
I think we like the sort of pliability of mouth.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.400
Oh, I mean, yes.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.600
But I think that you couldn't make this decision

29:07.600 --> 29:08.960
for everyone all at once.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.400
Because I think that there will be people

29:10.400 --> 29:12.400
who would be way into like,

29:12.400 --> 29:17.600
I can open my mouth and kiss you like three times as deep now.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.840
It's like a handshake at this point.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.600
We're getting in there so deep.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.600
But I don't think that's gonna be the goal

29:23.600 --> 29:26.160
when you do your beak kisses.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.720
When you see birds doing that to each other, Travis,

29:28.720 --> 29:31.040
that's probably a sort of regurgitation situation.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.080
Well, I mean, then that seems like two benefits, Griffin.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.360
I wouldn't want that, I don't think.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.680
Hey, could I take you out for dinner?

29:37.680 --> 29:38.640
I just met you.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.520
I just, yeah.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.400
It's hard for me to get past the fact

29:44.400 --> 29:46.000
that I don't wanna kiss a big bird.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.480
You don't wanna kiss a big bird?

29:48.480 --> 29:51.600
I'm thinking about that with my human brain,

29:51.600 --> 29:54.400
which is attached to my fleshy mouth, right?

29:54.400 --> 29:58.880
Yeah, now assume big bird has grown up and gotten a job.

29:58.880 --> 30:03.520
Perhaps big bird works, let's see.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.920
Give me the name of someplace someone would work.

30:05.920 --> 30:06.320
Griffin.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.320
No, I'm not gonna take a part in any of this.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.680
You don't want big bird to get a job?

30:11.680 --> 30:13.840
You want big bird to be unemployed in this economy?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.160
Big bird would be sweet as a big bird,

30:16.160 --> 30:16.960
got to be a pilot.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.640
And then air traffic control would be like,

30:18.640 --> 30:20.800
oh, big bird, go ahead and bring it in at that.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.560
And he's like, you don't tell me what to do.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.000
I'm a lord of the skies.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.520
You're gonna tell me how to fly?

30:25.520 --> 30:26.000
Shut up.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.560
Then he'd turn the radio off and just do his own thing.

30:28.560 --> 30:32.160
Okay, so big bird has just gotten back from a turnaround trip,

30:32.160 --> 30:34.400
flew from Cincinnati to LA and then back.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.600
No, baby, he's, no, no, no, no, no, baby.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.840
He's out across the Atlantic.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.240
He's doing the big, the big bird needs the big bird.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.040
You know what I'm saying?

30:43.040 --> 30:45.520
What I'm saying is he came right back cause he missed me, right?

30:45.520 --> 30:49.600
And he didn't say he could have had two days over there in Paris

30:49.600 --> 30:51.440
and said he was like, I gotta get home to Travis.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.160
He comes home and he leans in for a kiss.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.360
What am I gonna do?

30:55.360 --> 30:56.560
Not smooch that beak?

30:56.560 --> 30:59.120
Yeah, he came home from Paris, Griffin.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.240
Griffin came home from, he could have stayed in Paris for 48 hours.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.280
He had earned it.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.320
He had flown there.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.600
He took the jump seat back.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.200
You know how uncomfortable that is.

31:07.200 --> 31:12.080
Wait, is this, is this pre or during COVID?

31:12.080 --> 31:14.240
This is after COVID is done.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.280
Okay, so we've actually gotten through all that.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.440
I'd kiss anything that moves if COVID was over.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.080
I don't care.

31:20.080 --> 31:20.960
I'll kiss anything.

31:20.960 --> 31:25.200
The year is, the month is April 2021.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.240
Oh, that's nice.

31:26.240 --> 31:30.720
COVID is over officially and Big Bird has returned from Paris.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.600
And what's that?

31:31.600 --> 31:34.640
He brought me a baguette and because of the quick turnaround,

31:34.640 --> 31:36.400
it's still a little warm.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.000
And he leans, oh, oh.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.400
And it's one of those like ham and butter sandwiches

31:40.400 --> 31:42.000
that are so fucking good.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.200
And he, quote Monsieur.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.200
And no, I think it's just Jamon.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.920
And he leans in to give me a smooch.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.240
What am I gonna do, Griffin?

31:50.240 --> 31:52.400
Kick him out, turn him away?

31:52.400 --> 31:53.280
Got a smooch, Big Bird.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.120
Am I smooching Big Bird?

31:55.120 --> 32:01.920
You don't need to, but if Falco Lombardi from Star Fox

32:01.920 --> 32:07.280
came around, I don't know, I don't know.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.440
I have one option to get us out of this.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.000
And that is for me to say it's time to go to Money Zone.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.440
No, get on my back.

32:13.440 --> 32:14.960
Come on, we're getting out of here, guys.

32:14.960 --> 32:27.280
On the wings of love.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.360
I have incredible vision.

32:29.920 --> 32:32.480
And so I'm the only one on this show you can trust

32:32.480 --> 32:36.160
to read this ad copy and tell you that Warby Parker

32:36.160 --> 32:37.680
is a great way to get glasses.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.640
Take it from me.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.680
Warby Parker is offering boutique quality eyewear

32:41.680 --> 32:43.520
at a revolutionary price point.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.800
They've got eyeglasses, sunglasses, contact lenses,

32:46.800 --> 32:47.840
and eye exams.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.320
Warby Parker is committed to providing exceptional vision

32:50.320 --> 32:52.320
care online and in stores.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.680
Justin, I wear glasses.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.360
Oh, no.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.000
I didn't know.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.120
I'm sorry, Travis.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.880
God, how embarrassing that is for me.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.280
It's okay, Justin, because I can read this copy too,

33:03.280 --> 33:04.160
because it's not okay.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.040
You're still my brother.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.360
But I'm wearing Warby Parker glasses right now

33:07.360 --> 33:10.560
so I could see I did the home try-on program.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.200
I don't know if anyone has ever noticed this about me ever,

33:13.200 --> 33:14.640
but I have a large head.

33:14.640 --> 33:18.080
And so I ordered the glasses through the home try-on program

33:18.080 --> 33:21.600
to make sure that they physically fit around

33:21.600 --> 33:22.960
the girth of my skull.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.800
And several of them did, and I was very excited about this.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.040
So I bought the ones that did.

33:29.040 --> 33:33.520
You know what they say about have a big head?

33:33.520 --> 33:34.480
Hard to find hats.

33:36.000 --> 33:36.500
Nope.

33:36.960 --> 33:37.760
Okay.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.400
The other thing.

33:39.440 --> 33:40.160
Wide ears.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.080
Wide ears.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.480
Yeah, you keep acting like you don't know.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.520
My big dick.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.480
Well, thanks for the ad revenue, Warby Parker.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.680
You can try their free home try-on program.

33:53.680 --> 33:57.840
Order five pairs of glasses to try at home for free for five days.

34:07.280 --> 34:12.080
Try five pairs of glasses at home for free at warbyparker.com slash my brother.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.480
Now it doesn't say this is a limited time thing,

34:14.480 --> 34:16.480
but considering the content of this ad,

34:16.480 --> 34:19.040
I bet that link's gonna go dead pretty quick.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.320
So go ahead and head on over to warbyparker.com slash my brother

34:22.320 --> 34:24.240
and show them that that is the kind of thing

34:24.240 --> 34:26.400
that gets a response from our people.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.000
Real quick, let's talk about Honey.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.800
Honey is the rad little doodad that you get on your computer.

34:32.800 --> 34:37.200
And then whenever you're shopping, it looks for promo codes.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.680
And if it finds one for whatever it is that you're buying,

34:39.680 --> 34:41.280
it'll put it in there right away.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.680
And it's automatic and it saves you money.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.160
And real quick, and real quick, just real quick.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.960
Yeah, I got a big dick.

34:48.960 --> 34:52.560
And see, I feel like it would be unfair if we did one for Warby Parker

34:52.560 --> 34:54.320
and we did not do one for Honey.

34:54.320 --> 34:57.280
There's not much else to add because that's how simple Honey is.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.240
It's a little browser extension that looks for promo codes for you.

35:00.240 --> 35:04.960
And I use it and I've saved money on like music software

35:04.960 --> 35:06.720
and like tons of cache.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.720
It just saves you money. It's fantastic.

35:08.720 --> 35:14.880
I got a replacement plate for my router table from Craig.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.960
Had to get a new one that fit my Triton router.

35:20.160 --> 35:23.280
Because I did one with pre-drilled holes and I made my own,

35:23.280 --> 35:25.120
but I thought it'd be a little bit better fit

35:25.120 --> 35:28.240
if I got one that was custom for the router.

35:28.240 --> 35:32.160
And I managed to save a little cash using Honey.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.760
Yeah, so that's all it is.

35:33.760 --> 35:34.560
It's free.

35:34.560 --> 35:38.800
And you can join it for free today at joinhoney.com slash brother.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.640
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.520
Hi, are you someone who thinks that when one door closes,

35:45.520 --> 35:46.560
another one opens?

35:46.560 --> 35:48.800
Someone who always sees the light at the end of the tunnel.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.560
If you answered yes to one or both of these questions, good for you.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.920
We are not those people.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.160
Nope, I'm Annabelle Gurwitch and I'm a,

35:56.160 --> 36:00.800
you know that other door opening, it probably leads to a broom closet kind of person.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.680
And I'm Laura House. When I see a light at the end of a tunnel,

36:03.680 --> 36:06.320
I assume it's a train headed right toward me.

36:06.320 --> 36:09.760
Laura and I have created a brand new podcast for people like us.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.440
It's called Tiny Victories.

36:11.440 --> 36:16.960
We're sharing personal tiny victories or things we've read or seen that inspire resilience.

36:16.960 --> 36:19.920
So if you're looking for a tiny reason to get out of bed each week,

36:19.920 --> 36:21.840
subscribe to Tiny Victories.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.840
Available on Maximum Fun or wherever you get your podcasts.

36:25.840 --> 36:26.720
Let's get tiny.

36:46.720 --> 36:47.200
Munch Squad.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.880
It's a podcast within a podcast profile.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.120
Latest, greatest in brand eating.

36:51.120 --> 36:54.560
There is nothing that you can say in this segment that's going to top

36:54.560 --> 37:00.640
you ordering the fried fish leavens that you used to order a box of.

37:00.640 --> 37:01.360
That's true.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.440
I do want to say a couple things.

37:04.480 --> 37:10.640
I, like our friend Lynn, ordered the ghost pepper donut that we talked about last time.

37:10.640 --> 37:11.520
Oh, how was that?

37:11.520 --> 37:12.560
It was not bad.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.120
How was the spice?

37:13.120 --> 37:15.120
Not as spicy as you want, but it's a little bit of a spice.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.080
It gets you on the back end.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.360
You're like, whoa, hello.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.040
Now, did you eat the whole thing?

37:19.040 --> 37:20.000
Yes, I ate the whole thing.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.120
Because Lynn appeared to take one bite and then bag it.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.760
If you want to watch Living Legend, Lynn, my old Miranda,

37:25.760 --> 37:28.400
eat a ghost pepper donut, it's on our YouTube channel.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.600
His mouth is more valuable than Justin's mouth.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.160
That is true.

37:32.160 --> 37:32.880
God knows that.

37:32.880 --> 37:33.920
Fair and dangerous.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.320
This is a bagel notice.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.440
Just a bagel alert.

37:39.440 --> 37:45.040
Einstein Brothers Bagels introduces a new, this is really, can I say it's like,

37:45.600 --> 37:47.200
it's going to be really fun.

37:47.200 --> 37:47.680
You know what I mean?

37:47.680 --> 37:49.440
Because we could all use something a little bit fun.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.080
Of course.

37:50.080 --> 37:50.560
Yeah.

37:50.560 --> 37:54.640
Okay, so Einstein Brothers Bagels introduces you to new party bagels.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.360
Oh.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.720
Arriving at select locations nationwide November 12th.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.640
Ready to show your sweet tooth a good time.

38:00.640 --> 38:01.440
Wait, can we guess?

38:02.480 --> 38:03.200
I don't want to guess.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.200
I want to start the party.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.080
No, it's just party bagels.

38:08.080 --> 38:08.960
Is it frosted?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.240
I'll just tell you, it's party bagels.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.800
All Einstein Brothers Bagels wants to do is have some fun.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.240
Just like everyone else this year.

38:18.240 --> 38:23.440
Yeah, fucking even, even, it is like obligatory.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.720
You cannot announce a new fast food item without saying like,

38:26.720 --> 38:29.440
because of COVID, we're just trying to have some fun, okay?

38:30.000 --> 38:36.560
So yes, we're acknowledging the ongoing pandemic in our press release about party bagels.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.400
The new party bagels are shaking things up.

38:39.760 --> 38:42.160
Raising the roof of the bagel case, if you will.

38:42.160 --> 38:42.720
Oh boy.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.360
With the promise of a sweet indulgence that will bring a smile to faces young and old.

38:47.360 --> 38:49.680
I'm having fucking fun already.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.120
I know, it's already really fun.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.600
Einstein Brothers Bagels had developed two flavors

38:53.600 --> 38:56.240
that will make your taste buds sing sweet praises.

38:56.240 --> 38:56.640
Oh?

38:56.640 --> 38:57.680
To who?

38:57.680 --> 38:58.400
Jesus?

38:58.400 --> 38:59.120
To Christ?

38:59.840 --> 39:03.280
There's churro, which starts with a donut.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.320
You're fucking, okay.

39:07.360 --> 39:11.280
You just drop that in a fucking chemical bath or what's up?

39:11.280 --> 39:16.240
No, it's a donut and they smear it in the middle with sweet cream cheese,

39:16.240 --> 39:19.840
buttercream frosting and coat it on top with cinnamon sugar.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.040
It will take you back to roller coasters and carnival games.

39:24.000 --> 39:24.560
And then there's-

39:24.560 --> 39:28.720
I would love to be in the R&D meeting for Einstein Brothers where they're like,

39:28.720 --> 39:30.480
yeah, but it's just a donut.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.440
It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:31.440 --> 39:31.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.240
But get this, we call it a bagel.

39:35.760 --> 39:37.760
It's not a donut, it's a party bagel.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.040
Oh, that's good, that's good.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.200
They'll never know.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.280
We better not call it a donut in the press release.

39:43.280 --> 39:46.160
Oh yeah, that'd be a big fuck up.

39:46.160 --> 39:49.120
Yeah, chocolate birthday cake starts with a donut

39:50.160 --> 39:52.800
and smeared in the middle with chocolate buttercream frosting,

39:52.800 --> 39:55.120
glazed with chocolate frosting and topped with confetti sprinkles.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.800
If it isn't your birthday, it will feel like it is.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.880
So yeah, that's right, friend.

40:00.880 --> 40:06.160
Now you can have the visceral thrill of spending your birthday at Einstein Brothers bagels.

40:06.160 --> 40:10.320
Or even better, at your house in lockdown, eating a donut by yourself.

40:10.320 --> 40:15.920
This is a quote from Chad Thompson, head of culinary innovations at Einstein Brothers bagels,

40:15.920 --> 40:20.960
which in this case is selling donuts, is the culinary innovation here.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.960
We wanted to bring a bit of fun to the breakfast table.

40:26.160 --> 40:30.800
Party bagels are a sweet treat done the Einstein Brothers bagel way

40:30.800 --> 40:33.600
that the whole family will love.

40:33.600 --> 40:37.680
It's guys, it's donuts.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.040
I don't know, it's just-

40:39.040 --> 40:46.320
I don't know, it just feels like if your company's gonna be called fucking Einstein in it,

40:46.320 --> 40:52.000
the name of it, when you do things, when you make brand choices,

40:52.560 --> 40:55.120
they gotta be smart in some way.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.960
Fucking Einstein would never look at a bagel and be like, what is this?

40:59.520 --> 41:02.080
Some sort of party donut?

41:02.080 --> 41:04.160
I got it backwards, but you get the point?

41:04.160 --> 41:12.960
I mean, it does, okay, it does imply that up till now, every other bagel has been-

41:12.960 --> 41:14.320
A fucking work bagel.

41:14.320 --> 41:15.440
Has been work bagels.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.680
Has been business bagels.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.240
Business, it's been business.

41:20.240 --> 41:23.120
Or I guess it would be business donuts?

41:23.120 --> 41:23.360
Yeah.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.640
Business donuts.

41:24.640 --> 41:25.600
Business donuts, right.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.800
Business donuts, party bagels.

41:26.800 --> 41:27.040
Yes.

41:27.040 --> 41:37.760
I heard you were discussing donuts.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.240
Oh boy.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.360
Cool, he's back.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.000
Hey.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.440
Hello, I have such a pleasure to be invited back.

41:43.440 --> 41:46.000
It's me, Count Donut.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.360
Count Donut, I'm not really plugged into social anymore,

41:49.360 --> 41:54.880
so I don't really know how our fans felt about your sort of occupation of the last episode.

41:54.880 --> 41:58.640
The only thing they could discuss was that Justin's compression settings

41:58.640 --> 42:00.400
were wrong on his soundboard.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.520
Okay, well-

42:01.520 --> 42:02.400
But that should be-

42:02.400 --> 42:06.640
What does it sound like with a Transylvanian accent when you say non-plus?

42:07.840 --> 42:14.080
I think everybody loved me and I'm here not with donut news,

42:14.080 --> 42:16.880
although you have summoned me by discussing donuts.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.520
Sorry, it's actually your Count Party Bagel now.

42:19.520 --> 42:19.760
Yeah.

42:19.760 --> 42:26.640
Count Party Bagel is here to tell you about new innovation from Heinz.

42:26.640 --> 42:26.880
Okay.

42:29.120 --> 42:33.120
From ketchup-dipped fries as vampire fangs,

42:33.120 --> 42:36.800
to hot dog fingers dripping in ketchup.

42:36.800 --> 42:42.480
For years, fans have used Heinz ketchup to add deliciously convincing blood

42:43.200 --> 42:45.280
to their Halloween celebrations.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.880
I'm salivating already.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.000
It's ketchup though.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.720
Yeah, has anyone done either of those things?

42:51.280 --> 42:56.640
Now, ahead of what is sure to be a different kind of Halloween celebration,

42:57.440 --> 43:02.080
the brand is debuting a Heinz tomato blood ketchup.

43:02.080 --> 43:02.640
What?

43:02.640 --> 43:05.200
To contribute to the spooky fun.

43:06.640 --> 43:07.680
Wait, huh?

43:08.480 --> 43:09.360
I'm gonna be sick.

43:10.560 --> 43:15.200
Fans have had to navigate a lot this year and Halloween is no exception.

43:15.200 --> 43:19.040
Said Shirley Hayden, the brand manager for Heinz ketchup,

43:19.040 --> 43:27.360
making the obligatory reference to COVID-19 in the context of Heinz tomato blood.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.360
Does that sentence end with,

43:29.920 --> 43:33.600
and we're just gonna throw this fucking thing on top of the pile.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.840
Hey, you've already dealt with so many other things.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.280
What's one more thing?

43:37.280 --> 43:37.920
Bloodchip.

43:39.120 --> 43:44.320
I hope that for many, many reasons that the pandemic doesn't go on for a long time

43:44.320 --> 43:47.040
because it would reach a point where in these press releases,

43:47.760 --> 43:53.200
like the second paragraph would just start with, you know, so here we are.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.760
Travis, as soon as we lick this thing,

43:56.560 --> 44:02.160
do you know that we're gonna have a good two years at the minimum of just like,

44:02.800 --> 44:06.960
we're back, our doors are open, family, community.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.120
Finally, you can lick the counters again.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.680
Lick the counters, baby, it's Hardee's.

44:11.680 --> 44:14.400
Like nonstop.

44:15.040 --> 44:18.160
Now you eat the hamburgers from our hands.

44:18.160 --> 44:21.200
Thank you, first responders, frontline workers.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.360
Come buy a fucking Chevy.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.200
With Heinz tomato blood ketchup,

44:27.200 --> 44:31.840
we wanted to give families a fun way to go big with their spooky celebrations,

44:32.480 --> 44:36.560
even if they look a little different in 2020.

44:36.560 --> 44:38.000
Hey, Shirley, fuck you.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.640
Seriously, that's two in one quote.

44:40.640 --> 44:43.040
Wicked it, things are bad.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.200
What were you saying about ketchup?

44:45.200 --> 44:48.720
Thanks for the reminder though about the ongoing pandemic.

44:50.000 --> 44:57.200
The limited edition bottles are filled with the delicious thick and rich Heinz ketchup

44:57.200 --> 45:03.520
fans know and love in a spooky Halloween themed bottle

45:03.520 --> 45:09.600
that even vampires within the guilty as charged.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.280
All right, just to clarify from that sentence,

45:11.280 --> 45:13.440
you just said it's just regular ketchup in the bottle,

45:13.440 --> 45:14.640
but this is a different label.

45:15.200 --> 45:22.400
Yes, Travis, the Heinz ketchup company is distracting you from 200,000 plus Americans

45:22.400 --> 45:26.560
dead of COVID by putting a different sticker on the ketchup.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.320
This should fix it, right?

45:28.320 --> 45:29.040
Okay.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.360
I mean, my spirits are lifted.

45:31.360 --> 45:34.480
My spirits are lifted for the last minute and a half.

45:35.360 --> 45:37.520
It's sort of occupied a majority of my brain space,

45:37.520 --> 45:39.440
so I guess I do have Heinz to think about that.

45:40.320 --> 45:44.240
Can't wait to sink your teeth in the Heinz tomato blood ketchup

45:44.240 --> 45:50.400
from now until October 31st at 11 59 p.m. CDT.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.080
It's fun that they have to specify the time zone

45:54.080 --> 45:58.400
as if you're waiting until within the last two hours of the promotion.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.840
Good to get in there.

45:59.840 --> 46:05.440
They're giving away 570 bottles of Heinz tomato ketchup

46:05.440 --> 46:08.400
to those who participate in a TikTok hashtag challenge

46:09.040 --> 46:11.120
launching Friday, October 23rd.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.920
I guarantee you that the original amount was 57

46:15.920 --> 46:17.200
and they thought that's not enough.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.400
That's not enough bottles.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.040
Enough and now 570.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.760
That will fix the ongoing national malaise.

46:24.800 --> 46:25.840
Count party donut.

46:25.840 --> 46:27.920
I got to tell you, great news.

46:27.920 --> 46:31.120
Party, I believe party bagel.

46:31.120 --> 46:34.960
Sorry, see in my mind the Einstein brothers have succeeded

46:34.960 --> 46:37.440
in making these two foods completely interchangeable.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.840
But if this doesn't do it for you, Count Party Bagel,

46:41.840 --> 46:45.440
you can get the Ed Sheeran one that looks like his arm

46:45.440 --> 46:47.840
and then you can just chomp right into that

46:47.840 --> 46:50.080
imagining that you are draining the viscera

46:50.800 --> 46:54.720
from beloved singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.

46:54.720 --> 46:59.120
This promotion started on October 23rd.

46:59.120 --> 47:03.440
Can I ask our TikTok correspondent Travis McElroy

47:03.440 --> 47:06.880
to check for Heinz Halloween hashtag videos?

47:06.880 --> 47:08.400
I've already seen it, Count.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.240
It's been on everything and I can honestly say

47:12.240 --> 47:14.320
none of them have had anything to do

47:14.320 --> 47:16.640
with condiments of any sort.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.560
People are just slapping that shit

47:18.560 --> 47:20.640
on their twerking videos or whatever.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.520
Are they twerking on a bottle of ketchup?

47:23.520 --> 47:25.680
A bottle of ketchup? No, that's the thing.

47:26.640 --> 47:29.200
Maybe there's a bottle present just off screen,

47:29.200 --> 47:32.480
but I have been scanning every inch of those twerking videos

47:32.480 --> 47:34.560
looking for ketchup and I've seen nothing.

47:36.240 --> 47:38.320
Well, there's a...

47:38.320 --> 47:39.920
There's a sticker, by the way.

47:39.920 --> 47:41.840
I wanted to quickly describe it.

47:42.640 --> 47:46.800
It says Heinz Tomato Blood on it.

47:48.880 --> 47:49.360
That's it.

47:49.360 --> 47:49.680
Okay.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.640
Does that help your family celebrate Halloween no more?

47:52.640 --> 47:53.440
It doesn't hurt.

47:53.440 --> 47:55.600
Does that turn things around for you?

47:55.600 --> 47:56.080
Sure.

47:56.800 --> 47:57.840
At the bottom of the press release,

47:57.840 --> 47:59.200
I just wanted to mention one more thing

47:59.200 --> 48:01.280
before I disappear into the night.

48:02.080 --> 48:06.240
Heinz can confirm that only the juiciest, ripest tomatoes

48:06.240 --> 48:10.480
were harmed in the making of delicious Heinz Tomato Blood ketchup.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.560
Gross, why is that the line that took it too far for me?

48:12.560 --> 48:13.680
That's fucking perverts.

48:13.680 --> 48:15.600
I think they are trying to...

48:15.600 --> 48:16.960
That's an asterisk.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.720
I think they're trying to clarify

48:18.720 --> 48:21.360
that the product contains no blood.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.080
Oh.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.480
That's good that they cleared that up.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.000
It's good that...

48:26.000 --> 48:27.680
Anyway, I have to go, fellas.

48:27.680 --> 48:30.400
Let me know if I am needed again

48:30.400 --> 48:35.920
to help distract you from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.760
I'll miss you, Count.

48:37.760 --> 48:38.800
I'll miss him too.

48:40.080 --> 48:40.640
What?

48:40.640 --> 48:41.440
Get out of...

48:41.440 --> 48:42.000
Just go.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.640
Well, are you sure?

48:44.640 --> 48:45.600
Because I could stick around.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.640
No, you need to go.

48:46.640 --> 48:47.920
The sun's coming up.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.120
The sun's coming up.

48:49.840 --> 48:50.960
That's okay.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.880
I just glisten in the light.

48:52.880 --> 48:55.440
No, but it's a high UV index.

48:55.440 --> 48:55.920
Goodbye.

48:59.440 --> 49:00.400
Is that cricket?

49:00.400 --> 49:02.000
It's a terrible, terrible bat.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.400
He makes the worst bat noises when he...

49:04.400 --> 49:05.760
Yeah, it's really unpleasant.

49:05.760 --> 49:10.160
I was doing something else,

49:10.160 --> 49:13.280
and then I heard the bats after he left.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.080
Yeah, yeah.

49:14.080 --> 49:17.040
No, I was sitting in the chair opposite,

49:17.040 --> 49:18.560
just staring at him.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.240
Yeah, he's under his throat.

49:20.240 --> 49:21.520
Do you want to yahoo a real quick one?

49:21.520 --> 49:23.360
Well, I want Justin to do this next question.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.200
It's not the kind of question we normally do,

49:25.200 --> 49:27.440
and I think we can knock it out pretty quick.

49:27.440 --> 49:27.840
Okay.

49:27.840 --> 49:30.160
At what point does an aquarium become a zoo?

49:32.080 --> 49:34.000
The aquarium near me has three sloths,

49:34.640 --> 49:36.080
which I never thought was weird

49:36.080 --> 49:38.960
until I was talking to a friend about it,

49:38.960 --> 49:40.240
and she thought it was super weird

49:40.240 --> 49:42.960
that there were land animals and birds at the aquarium.

49:42.960 --> 49:46.640
How many land animals is too many land animals for an aquarium?

49:46.640 --> 49:48.640
At what point does it become a zoo?

49:48.640 --> 49:51.120
Or is there a midpoint where it is this aquarium?

49:51.120 --> 49:52.720
That's from Elizabeth from Maryland.

49:54.160 --> 49:59.360
Well, the only thing I have to go on for this one

49:59.360 --> 50:00.800
is the Austin Aquarium,

50:01.360 --> 50:02.800
which I think I've talked about on this

50:02.800 --> 50:04.240
or other shows before.

50:04.960 --> 50:08.080
It is a blighted sort of hell zone.

50:09.200 --> 50:11.040
It's the worst building.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.120
It's an old sort of TJ Maxx

50:13.120 --> 50:15.520
that they crammed a bunch of sick old turtles inside,

50:15.520 --> 50:17.520
and then they started to put kiddie pools

50:17.520 --> 50:21.040
full of fish that they bought at Petland in there too,

50:21.040 --> 50:24.080
and then they threw in about a trillion parrots,

50:24.080 --> 50:26.240
and then for good measure, they were like,

50:26.240 --> 50:28.240
let's get some lemurs in there, baby,

50:28.240 --> 50:29.280
and put them in the lobby

50:29.280 --> 50:31.440
so it greets people in our fish zoo,

50:31.440 --> 50:33.680
but then people come in and little girls

50:33.680 --> 50:35.360
stick their hand in, does get bit,

50:35.360 --> 50:37.600
and then the parents are like, we're suing you,

50:37.600 --> 50:39.920
and they were like, the lemur was not vaccinated,

50:39.920 --> 50:40.800
and then the parents were like,

50:40.800 --> 50:43.120
we're wicked suing you a lot now.

50:43.120 --> 50:46.720
I think that you can, I think aquariums should have fish,

50:46.720 --> 50:49.200
and zoos get everything else.

50:49.200 --> 50:54.080
Yeah, just let them, yeah, just let them keep everything else.

50:54.080 --> 50:54.880
Unless.

50:54.880 --> 50:57.520
No, there's so many kinds of fish.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.840
Unless, unless.

50:59.840 --> 51:01.840
The sloths and the birds are always swimming around.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.920
That's cute, that's cute.

51:03.920 --> 51:05.280
Yeah, you don't give them no land.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.880
That's cute, I do like that, but wait,

51:08.880 --> 51:10.720
you never let them get out of the water?

51:10.720 --> 51:13.440
You never let them get out of the water?

51:13.440 --> 51:16.720
Because the turnaround rate on those sloths, Travis,

51:16.720 --> 51:21.720
is going to, the overhead, your sloth money,

51:22.720 --> 51:25.440
is your sloth budget's gonna really break the bank,

51:25.440 --> 51:26.400
I'm worried.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.080
You give them a rock,

51:28.080 --> 51:31.120
but slowly it gets hotter and hotter while they stand on it.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.520
I see, so now it's a saw trap.

51:34.560 --> 51:36.080
Now, this isn't even funny,

51:36.080 --> 51:37.840
because this is horrible animal abuse,

51:37.840 --> 51:38.680
what I'm describing.

51:38.680 --> 51:40.560
It's horrible, it's horrible, it's terrible.

51:40.560 --> 51:42.320
I think there's so many different kinds of things

51:42.320 --> 51:44.000
that live in the water, right?

51:44.000 --> 51:44.840
Yeah.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.560
More than we know about.

51:46.560 --> 51:51.040
Join me as we journey through the blue planet.

51:51.040 --> 51:54.400
It's not, it's part of our planet.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.160
The ocean's not a different planet.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.280
It is, it's a different planet

51:58.280 --> 52:00.320
where the fish and the mermen live.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.880
I hate that when David Attenborough's like,

52:02.880 --> 52:05.240
there's another world below the surface of,

52:05.240 --> 52:06.240
there's not, David.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.280
That's our water.

52:07.280 --> 52:10.960
I'm sorry, Justin, was that your impression of me,

52:10.960 --> 52:12.040
David Attenborough?

52:12.040 --> 52:15.400
Because it sounded like my impression of Dracula.

52:17.680 --> 52:22.680
I'm saying the pivot from having Dracula here,

52:23.160 --> 52:25.480
Donut Dracula, sorry, Party Bagel Dracula,

52:25.480 --> 52:30.480
here in my office to having David Attenborough in the office

52:31.560 --> 52:33.600
was a bit of a, it was a bit of a swing.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.520
While I'm here, do you have any questions about fish?

52:36.520 --> 52:37.480
Have you ever been to-

52:37.480 --> 52:38.320
Yeah, I'll bite.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.240
No, Griffin, shut up.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.720
This is a huge opportunity for me.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.040
Yes, I'm quite the git.

52:43.040 --> 52:45.320
I mean, I was gonna ask him a question.

52:45.320 --> 52:46.160
Oh, go for it.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.000
Yeah, sorry, I thought you were dismissing me.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.480
No, David, have you ever been

52:48.480 --> 52:49.800
to the Austin Aquarium, David?

52:49.800 --> 52:50.760
It's quite great.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.840
Yes, I own the Austin Aquarium

52:52.840 --> 52:54.560
and I didn't know how to appreciate

52:54.560 --> 52:56.320
the slander you were talking about.

52:56.320 --> 52:57.520
Can I do feedback?

52:57.520 --> 52:58.640
Do you do feedback?

52:58.640 --> 52:59.920
I didn't see a feedback box.

52:59.920 --> 53:00.760
Maybe I could do it here.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.240
Okay, I saw a turtle trying to climb over a rock,

53:03.240 --> 53:05.160
but it flipped upside down.

53:05.160 --> 53:07.200
Yes, that's part of the show.

53:07.200 --> 53:09.400
But no one did anything about it.

53:09.400 --> 53:13.160
That turtle has to learn self-reliance.

53:13.160 --> 53:14.560
Hey, David, can I bother you

53:14.560 --> 53:16.120
about the Austin Aquarium for a second?

53:16.120 --> 53:17.360
Yes, of course.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.920
Don't you think it's kind of confusing

53:18.920 --> 53:20.720
to have a young woman dressed as a mermaid

53:20.720 --> 53:22.960
doing face paint there in a place

53:22.960 --> 53:24.640
that is about the undersea life?

53:24.640 --> 53:25.480
Don't you think that's kind of confusing?

53:25.480 --> 53:28.200
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you said dressed as.

53:28.200 --> 53:30.120
I have to disagree with you there.

53:30.120 --> 53:33.000
She is an actual mermaid.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.240
Okay, but what about the one

53:34.240 --> 53:35.760
that I did see doing face paint

53:35.760 --> 53:38.160
that was dressed up as Anna from Frozen?

53:38.160 --> 53:42.080
Mm-hmm, that is, all of that is set underwater.

53:42.080 --> 53:42.920
It's not, Dave.

53:42.920 --> 53:45.240
Frozen is an underwater movie.

53:45.240 --> 53:46.960
Dave, it's not.

53:46.960 --> 53:47.800
No.

53:47.800 --> 53:48.640
It's above Frozen.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.880
Which one am I thinking of?

53:51.320 --> 53:52.920
Little Mermaid is the only one

53:52.920 --> 53:54.720
that springs to mind immediately, Mr. M.

53:54.720 --> 53:57.440
Okay, I think that.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.960
I love that one with the crab.

53:59.960 --> 54:03.200
Why didn't you like vaccinate the lemur though, bud?

54:03.200 --> 54:05.400
I tried and the lemur said he didn't want it

54:05.400 --> 54:07.760
and then he said, I'd like to move it, move it,

54:07.760 --> 54:09.240
which I really appreciate.

54:09.240 --> 54:14.240
I'll give, I'll let you bye-bye on that one.

54:16.040 --> 54:19.400
I would forget too if I saw the lemur doing a cool dance.

54:19.400 --> 54:21.520
Okay, now I have to go.

54:21.520 --> 54:25.640
I'll mount up on my dragon and away we go.

54:25.640 --> 54:26.480
Ah!

54:26.480 --> 54:30.480
Ah!

54:30.480 --> 54:33.240
Sorry, David, if you could come back to Earth

54:33.240 --> 54:35.760
for one second, that last sound there.

54:35.760 --> 54:37.200
What was that?

54:37.200 --> 54:39.040
Was that the sound of your dragon

54:39.040 --> 54:41.400
or the sound of you communicating with your dragon

54:41.400 --> 54:42.600
in the dragon top?

54:42.600 --> 54:45.120
Well, don't be a fucking idiot, Justin.

54:45.120 --> 54:48.320
Of course, it was me speaking to my dragon.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.560
He speaks to me telepathically.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.360
And you speak to him through the dragon top.

54:54.360 --> 54:56.600
It's a one-way telepathic link.

54:56.600 --> 54:57.680
Read a book.

54:59.280 --> 55:01.360
Arrah!

55:01.360 --> 55:03.040
Oh, boy.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.960
Sorry, that sound sounded so much different

55:04.960 --> 55:06.160
from your other command.

55:06.160 --> 55:09.000
Well, he said a different word, Justin.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.960
That was me saying, can you believe this fucking guy?

55:12.960 --> 55:17.960
And he telepathed back, yeah, a real jag.

55:20.920 --> 55:23.520
That's one of the judge your dragons have encountered.

55:23.520 --> 55:25.560
Honestly, he barely knows me.

55:25.560 --> 55:28.480
No, Justin, he says he went to fifth grade with you.

55:28.480 --> 55:31.000
Are you still here or are you flying on a dragon?

55:31.000 --> 55:34.880
You keep calling us back with your inane questions.

55:36.280 --> 55:39.640
Now I'm going to ride this dragon into space.

55:41.040 --> 55:42.560
Arroo!

55:42.560 --> 55:45.680
Oh, damn it, he did say he found all the Earth animals.

55:47.840 --> 55:49.720
So he's going to look for other ones.

55:49.720 --> 55:54.720
Oh, man, he's going to die up there

55:54.800 --> 55:57.320
as soon as he gets out of where the air is.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.320
That last sound translated to,

55:59.320 --> 56:01.640
if I've picked up a little bit of dragon tongue,

56:01.640 --> 56:03.200
I think that last sound translated to,

56:03.200 --> 56:04.760
we're going all the way to space, baby.

56:04.760 --> 56:07.320
That's right, Papa David don't need no more oxygen.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.960
I'm good.

56:08.960 --> 56:09.800
I miss them.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.040
I miss them too, and I miss our listeners

56:13.040 --> 56:15.000
who sadly have to depart from us

56:15.000 --> 56:17.600
now that we've completed this episode of My Brother,

56:17.600 --> 56:19.280
My Brother and Me.

56:19.280 --> 56:20.400
We've had just a hoot.

56:20.400 --> 56:21.880
We hope you're hanging in there.

56:21.880 --> 56:25.480
I hope you're feeding all your worries and cares

56:25.480 --> 56:28.040
to the anxiety alligator who will chomp them up

56:28.040 --> 56:30.120
and swallow them down and whisk them away

56:30.120 --> 56:32.840
so you don't have to stress about them anymore

56:32.840 --> 56:37.840
and just try to hang in there, pals, and go vote.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.320
Yes, please.

56:39.320 --> 56:40.160
God, go vote for Joe Biden.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.000
Jesus Christ.

56:41.000 --> 56:41.840
Vote Joe Biden.

56:41.840 --> 56:44.680
Especially, I hear y'all in Texas are trying to,

56:44.680 --> 56:46.400
trying to pull off a sneaky little job.

56:46.400 --> 56:47.920
Oh, we're doing a sneaky little job.

56:47.920 --> 56:49.320
Don't tell them.

56:49.320 --> 56:52.160
Only tell folks who are down with it,

56:52.160 --> 56:54.160
with Joe and his tight fanny.

56:54.160 --> 56:56.200
Just get out there and punch in the thing

56:56.200 --> 56:57.640
for Joe's tight fanny,

56:57.640 --> 57:00.480
and let's ride this baby to Blue Town

57:00.480 --> 57:05.000
and fucking embarrass the spanker, the spanky.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.960
It's gonna be, I can't wait for November 3rd

57:06.960 --> 57:10.360
when y'all are like, number one, Texas has turned blue.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.400
Number two, there is a basement at the Alamo.

57:13.400 --> 57:18.400
We are so sorry that we were not truthful about that.

57:19.320 --> 57:21.160
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:21.160 --> 57:23.200
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

57:23.200 --> 57:25.400
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.520
Great tracks and tunes on that one.

57:27.520 --> 57:29.840
Lots of premium cuts on that one.

57:29.840 --> 57:32.080
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

57:32.080 --> 57:35.440
I just wanna tell you about two great McElroy podcasts

57:35.440 --> 57:36.560
that maybe you're not listening to.

57:36.560 --> 57:39.480
First, there's one that my wife, Teresa, and I are doing

57:39.480 --> 57:41.760
where we are talking about the new season

57:41.760 --> 57:43.480
of Great British Bake Off.

57:43.480 --> 57:44.960
It's called Bake On.

57:44.960 --> 57:46.520
Find it on your podcatchers,

57:46.520 --> 57:49.160
and we also put it up on our YouTube channel.

57:49.160 --> 57:52.400
And also, Besties, which Griffin and Justin do

57:52.400 --> 57:55.200
with Russ Frushtick and Chris Plant.

57:55.200 --> 57:58.400
This week they talked about spooky games,

57:58.400 --> 58:00.000
which I thoroughly enjoyed.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.560
But you guys didn't talk about the one

58:02.560 --> 58:06.120
with the sanity meter that I believe was on Dreamcast?

58:06.120 --> 58:07.600
It was GameCube, it was Eternal Darkness,

58:07.600 --> 58:09.160
and I did talk about it.

58:09.160 --> 58:10.560
What?

58:10.560 --> 58:12.040
Thank you for listening.

58:12.040 --> 58:14.720
I do listen, it's my favorite podcast.

58:14.720 --> 58:16.840
One of my favorites, I mean, I enjoy several.

58:16.840 --> 58:18.680
Also wanna tell you, lots of great merch on there.

58:18.680 --> 58:20.280
You're running out of time to get

58:20.280 --> 58:21.720
the October pin of the month,

58:21.720 --> 58:23.840
which is the Tiger on the Table pin,

58:23.840 --> 58:24.880
designed by Sam Schultz,

58:24.880 --> 58:26.840
which benefits the Marsha P. Johnson Institute

58:26.840 --> 58:29.280
and the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.

58:29.280 --> 58:32.320
But you can still get that Sawbones horseshoe crab shirt,

58:32.320 --> 58:34.400
the Candle Knights ornament designed by Lynn Doyle,

58:34.400 --> 58:36.880

58:36.880 --> 58:39.160

58:39.160 --> 58:40.960

We put jokes in that, by the way.

58:58.960 --> 59:00.320
Even if you don't wanna do a podcast,

59:00.320 --> 59:02.720
you just wanna read a book that we wrote.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.560
