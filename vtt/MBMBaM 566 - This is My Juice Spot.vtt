WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better, it's better with you

01:10.180 --> 01:15.700
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother I mean if I show for the margin era

01:15.700 --> 01:21.940
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis big dog woof woof

01:22.940 --> 01:29.660
Well, I'm sweet baby Griffin. What's wrong? Trap? I just feel like we're in them dog days of summer

01:29.660 --> 01:33.540
You know we live show and that was great. That was definitely a high point

01:34.220 --> 01:36.220
Yeah, the one that people can still

01:37.180 --> 01:42.780
Get and watch for ten bucks. They got a bit that I live for it slash NB NBA and virtual. Yeah, that's the way

01:42.780 --> 01:46.300
No, now I feel like we're in them summer doldrums

01:47.100 --> 01:48.460
Yeah

01:48.460 --> 01:50.020
You know

01:50.020 --> 01:54.260
You know trap. I don't feel that way at all. Oh, really. I want to yes

01:54.260 --> 02:02.420
And you but the family pulled in 70 million dollars this weekend, and I just so fucking stoked for these room lords

02:02.780 --> 02:04.780
then Michelle

02:05.180 --> 02:07.060
Tyrese yeah

02:07.060 --> 02:10.820
Wait, everybody does fast and the furious movie

02:10.820 --> 02:14.100
Oh, yeah, dude F9 pulled it in

02:14.980 --> 02:17.800
with 70 million dollars biggest

02:18.780 --> 02:23.160
Film opening ever during a global pandemic that is still ongoing

02:23.660 --> 02:30.380
Biggest whatever name fucking winter Malton said 9's got me feeling fine in his official review

02:30.380 --> 02:35.140
I don't know if the man has passed away or not. My doldrums are cured. That's all

02:35.660 --> 02:37.660
now now Justin

02:37.660 --> 02:43.340
Previously, I believe I believe uh back on how maybe it was even as far back as Thursday

02:43.340 --> 02:46.300
I believe it was you who is saying that there is a

02:46.860 --> 02:54.220
Newspaper in Seattle that did a review of fast and the furious 9 and called it the Muppet babies of

02:54.860 --> 03:01.340
The fast of the furious franchise. Yes, that is correct Travis, but that wasn't that wasn't a bad thing

03:01.340 --> 03:05.940
It wasn't a pejorative now. What does it mean that I've been thinking about it for five days

03:05.940 --> 03:09.620
Five days. Well, what could it just hold on? Wait, it's so important

03:09.620 --> 03:14.900
This is now a f9 watch and we get it's a we didn't set that we usually say that at the start

03:14.900 --> 03:19.520
But this has slowly evolved into a f9 watch and we're here now. Okay, good

03:20.360 --> 03:22.660
Okay, can I fact-check something real quick?

03:22.820 --> 03:28.480
Yes rotten tomato says this is the latest film in the saga the ninth that is actually the tenth

03:29.100 --> 03:33.500
What okay. Yeah. I mean are we counting Hobbs and Shaw? Are we killing?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.500
Okay, that's

03:36.020 --> 03:38.020
It is part of the saga

03:38.940 --> 03:41.800
It's canonical it's part of the Steven's cigar

03:42.380 --> 03:50.360
Honestly, they should just call this one fast and the furious one cuz it's the first one that John Felix Anthony Cena is a part

03:50.360 --> 03:52.360
of welcome to the scene

03:52.520 --> 03:56.740
Jonathan you you beautiful invisible man with your mini armbands

03:56.940 --> 04:00.320
Do you think he has that clause in his contract that he can't lose a fight? Oh

04:00.320 --> 04:03.460
Oh my god, then what happens when he fights the rock?

04:04.760 --> 04:12.380
We are working towards a point where the rock and John Cena and Vin Diesel would get in a fight with each other

04:12.380 --> 04:15.900
All three of them contractually obligated not to lose

04:16.540 --> 04:18.220
Yeah

04:18.220 --> 04:21.380
Run tomatoes while looking at these box office results

04:21.380 --> 04:27.200
I got a link to a vid here that says Vin Diesel on the fast and furious future

04:27.200 --> 04:34.180
It's not over and we'll be back more formidable than ever. Okay. No shit. Yeah, that's the name of it guys

04:34.180 --> 04:36.700
This video is 55 minutes long

04:41.220 --> 04:48.380
For 55 minutes about the fact that it's not over and we'll be back more formidable than ever. Hey guys, what's our Muppet Babies?

04:48.620 --> 04:50.420
What does that mean?

04:50.420 --> 04:56.980
No, but here's my thing. What's our what's the Muppet Babies of our franchise? Have we made it yet?

04:56.980 --> 05:03.940
What's our Muppet Babies? Here's my thing though. Okay, we need to define what it means to be the Muppet Babies of something

05:04.260 --> 05:10.420
Right. I the only way it makes sense to me and I've been thinking about it for a hundred and twenty hours is

05:10.860 --> 05:13.180
if Fast and Furious 9

05:13.780 --> 05:20.500
Features scenes of baby Vin Diesel and baby Rock and baby Tyrese and baby Luda and stuff like that

05:20.500 --> 05:26.740
Otherwise, I have no context for what it means to be the Muppet Babies of a franchise

05:27.280 --> 05:31.680
We use imaginations. I mean, yeah, it's like I guess I

05:32.720 --> 05:37.540
Mean, I guess the episode of Taz we did where we were all babies and it was based on Muppet Babies game

05:37.720 --> 05:43.920
It's probably the Muppet Babies. That's a probably pretty clear one-to-one. Yeah, there was also there's also a Jeffy's Place the

05:43.920 --> 05:51.920
Public access so that we did for a while that had that had that was mostly puppets. Yeah, they all learned lessons about

05:53.440 --> 05:57.480
Math and how not and not and not cussing

06:00.040 --> 06:02.380
There were four of the of the seven

06:03.680 --> 06:09.320
Episodes in the first season four were about not cussing. Yeah, not yeah, and you know what to be fair

06:09.320 --> 06:15.440
I think probably one of the reasons the show didn't hit. Thank you was we spent a lot of time

06:16.200 --> 06:18.200
explaining what cuss words were

06:21.360 --> 06:24.900
That was a deep dive, okay, this is now a Jeffy's Place watch

06:24.900 --> 06:31.200
Yeah, it used to be a fan I'm watching as a Jeffy's Place watch biggest problems with Jeffy's Place. Let's start them off

06:31.200 --> 06:35.760
Let's do top 75 biggest rounds of Jeffy's Place. I mean you gotta say number one

06:35.760 --> 06:41.320
No, there was no character named Jeffy that created so much confusion, right?

06:41.600 --> 06:45.440
There was one there's one named Jeffrey, but he was an adult human. Yeah

06:47.160 --> 06:49.160
Only reference. Yes. Yeah

06:50.040 --> 06:55.720
He was like God in that and but it was very clearly not his place people kept saying like I

06:56.400 --> 07:02.000
Jeffrey should get a place of his own. Yeah, our places. It's not Jeffy's Place. It's Jeffy's Place

07:02.000 --> 07:07.280
Yeah, I would say number two is probably when we insisted on anatomically incorrect puppets

07:07.280 --> 07:10.720
And I don't know exactly what we had in mind

07:10.720 --> 07:16.040
And I never settled on it with the art department because the designs of the puppets kept changing every week

07:17.560 --> 07:22.560
Yeah, there I mean everybody remembers huge Huey and he was just like this weirdly

07:23.820 --> 07:25.820
super muscular

07:26.040 --> 07:31.360
Puppet and none of the other puppets looked anything like him and nobody even made a big deal out of it

07:31.360 --> 07:34.120
It's just the people thought people want to see a yoke to yoke

07:36.160 --> 07:40.040
None of the muscles were in the right place either. No, they were all over that. Yeah, it was weird

07:40.040 --> 07:44.360
We invited Brian Henson over to look at the puppets and he said there can't be a shoulder here

07:44.720 --> 07:47.840
Someone get someone to help there can't be a shoulder here

07:47.920 --> 07:52.960
My dad would never allow this and he just started screaming. That's not how knees that's not

07:55.120 --> 07:59.480
I would say one major issue is halfway through the first season when the show is tanking

07:59.480 --> 08:05.160
We realized that we could maybe make inroads as having it be like a nice little bit of McGee and me

08:05.240 --> 08:08.720
Christian television magic and so we sort of pivoted that direction

08:08.720 --> 08:15.440
But also we didn't we also said a lot of wrong stuff about the Bible and things so that you like

08:15.440 --> 08:20.360
Yeah, like God God only likes it when you yell God can't hear you and yes bless you yell your prayers

08:20.360 --> 08:23.360
Like you remember that episode? Yeah, that's called

08:23.360 --> 08:27.820
God only hears you if you yell your prayers and then we got like some feedback from the Christian Council

08:27.820 --> 08:29.820
I was like, mmm, that's

08:31.280 --> 08:36.120
Yeah, what we do I still yell my prayers to this day guys, you know what?

08:37.440 --> 08:43.440
What's that? Yeah, yell them through a trombone it amplifies that even more. Yep. Well, you've learned that from Jeffy's place

08:43.440 --> 08:50.720
Yes, I did. Oh, yeah, I liked well, maybe not liked but I think maybe one of the problems was when we did yet again

08:50.920 --> 08:57.120
Another episode about like not consuming household chemicals and we went into detail about where to find the chemicals

08:57.120 --> 08:58.280
right

08:58.280 --> 09:04.240
Yeah, which chemicals might make you imagine weird things and like which ones taste good

09:04.240 --> 09:10.840
But you still shouldn't like they taste candy like but don't you still really shouldn't yeah, that was probably a misstep

09:13.080 --> 09:18.500
Why did we have to start every episode with a huge title card that said brought to you by George Soros

09:18.520 --> 09:25.120
Yeah, why did we decide to leave that up for 49 seconds before every episode and he didn't give us any money

09:25.120 --> 09:30.320
I don't know why we didn't money. It wasn't brought to him by him at all wasn't connected to him in any way

09:30.320 --> 09:35.100
I think we were trying to we were trying to court him with it. I think like it was yeah

09:37.160 --> 09:41.680
There was the one episode that was an employee training video for Dairy Queen

09:41.680 --> 09:46.520
Yeah, he asked us to do and we were like an episode short I guess and so we're like

09:46.520 --> 09:50.720
Let's just put up the Dairy Queen video. That was the best one though. It was really good

09:50.720 --> 09:56.600
It made me it made a lot of kids cry, but you know sandwiched between the bad Bible lessons and then don't cuss series

09:56.960 --> 10:00.160
Just having kids like learn like and this is how you do the dippers

10:00.840 --> 10:04.760
This is how to this is how we keep our sauces warm, etc

10:06.380 --> 10:08.920
Good show Jeffy's place. Oh, when's that coming back?

10:09.440 --> 10:13.300
Let's reboot it. And you know what a lot of people don't know Chris Evans first job

10:14.300 --> 10:16.000
Evans first

10:16.000 --> 10:21.320
We gave that kid a break and look at him now hat I have my hand buried up Chris Evans ass for so long

10:21.320 --> 10:24.040
I couldn't tell where I ended and he began and that's

10:27.120 --> 10:29.120
Best puppet I ever worked with

10:29.480 --> 10:34.560
Chris Evans, not a human not a human. Sorry an anatomically incorrect puppet

10:35.000 --> 10:37.260
I'm throwing a surprise birthday

10:37.840 --> 10:44.480
Anniversary party for my husband at the end of the year two days after I sent an invite to one of his longtime friends who will call

10:44.480 --> 10:48.400
See, oh a little injury. I like we so rarely get that

10:48.960 --> 10:56.840
My husband for colonel mustard my husband mentioned in casual conversation that he feels he's been drifting away from see

10:57.360 --> 11:01.240
Man, this question is a weird one to start. This is quite a little energy

11:01.240 --> 11:08.140
Yeah, our show it considering how they've grown apart. He wants to let that relationship die gracefully so he can focus on others

11:10.000 --> 11:12.100
Hey, okay Trev

11:12.100 --> 11:14.100
I'm

11:15.660 --> 11:17.460
Okay

11:17.460 --> 11:22.380
Husband has made it clear. He wants a clean break from see see has just sent me an RSVP

11:23.620 --> 11:25.620
He shouldn't have done so many letters

11:26.540 --> 11:28.500
RSVP for the party

11:28.500 --> 11:36.060
Do I respect my husband's decision up and go about the agonizing process of uninviting somebody from a party for no apparent reason or do?

11:36.060 --> 11:38.860
I play dumb and just let see show up surprise

11:38.860 --> 11:40.860
Surprise

11:40.860 --> 11:47.660
Not that last one that last one's the worst of both worlds. Yeah, because it still happens when that happens and

11:48.860 --> 11:52.300
It's it and it's bad with and it's bad a bad thing you've done

11:52.820 --> 11:56.780
Man, this is this is a tough one to do because there's two

11:57.700 --> 12:04.300
Like causes for the dissolution of this friendship and one is just like grown-up stuff you

12:04.300 --> 12:11.900
you know, maybe both of you haven't been putting in the effort required to maintain this relationship blown off a couple of

12:12.540 --> 12:17.180
Invitations to things not respond to a few texts and then it just kind of slowly

12:17.660 --> 12:20.660
Decays and that is salvageable. Yeah

12:21.620 --> 12:29.240
If it's a situation where see has done something truly heinous and your husband's like I'm I am done with see

12:29.240 --> 12:35.520
Then is it's your husband's birthday party. You should you should do the uncomfortable thing

12:35.520 --> 12:39.840
Well, I mean it does say in the question that's been drifting away and I don't think if someone was like, yeah

12:39.840 --> 12:43.680
He stole my dog and blew my car up, but I feel like we've been drifting away

12:45.080 --> 12:50.720
I think we can pretty much assume now. I will say he ponzi to my dad. Yeah, so I feel like we're growing apart

12:51.320 --> 12:55.840
I I would say for me. There's an added level here, which is that just on a personal level?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.840
I do not care for surprise parties

12:57.840 --> 12:58.720
Oh

12:58.720 --> 13:04.400
Okay, because I like to a part of the exciting thing for a birthday party for me or any kind of party is like looking

13:04.400 --> 13:05.680
Forward to it

13:05.680 --> 13:11.280
And like planning it I like planning it. Hey, I'm this is feeling irrelevant. No, no, no, I'm getting there

13:11.280 --> 13:14.040
Okay, so here's what I would say. Here's what I would want

13:14.040 --> 13:21.720
If I were your husband tell your husband about this thing that has happened this misunderstanding and then give your husband the option to you uninvite

13:22.840 --> 13:25.040
themselves from the party

13:25.040 --> 13:29.360
Right. Oh now it's a surprise on the guests, right?

13:30.360 --> 13:32.360
My husband's not here

13:32.840 --> 13:37.260
Yeah, you can leave your presents on the table. This is this is not that don't do that

13:37.680 --> 13:42.960
We actually had somebody do that once where there was in college. We were throwing a surprise party

13:43.800 --> 13:50.000
For for someone and she I found out about it and she snuck in the back door like climbed in through the window and jumped

13:50.000 --> 13:52.880
into the kitchen like surprise and everyone looked at her like

13:52.880 --> 13:54.040
you

13:54.040 --> 13:56.040
Have taken everything from me

13:58.960 --> 14:02.280
Reclaiming the power of the event. Yeah, you like that

14:02.280 --> 14:08.560
But nobody else at the party did and also the thing about a surprise party is also like surprise

14:08.840 --> 14:12.400
You're hosting this party and you need to make sure everybody here is happy

14:12.480 --> 14:19.320
Yeah fed and you don't get to go to bed until we all leave. Yeah, I think that adult friendships are

14:19.320 --> 14:23.480
Are are difficult. I think you reach a certain age and

14:24.480 --> 14:27.560
Gaining new friendships becomes a million times harder

14:27.560 --> 14:29.960
and so I reach phases in my life where I'm like

14:29.960 --> 14:33.960
I need to start reconnecting with some buds cuz I'm I ain't making any new ones and

14:34.360 --> 14:37.980
Maybe this is an opportunity for that. But I think you I do think you need to

14:38.800 --> 14:45.680
Like blow the surprise and tell your husband. What's what what is? Yeah, what's happening? No, sir. No, sir, or unless

14:45.680 --> 14:49.880
There's two other things that could happen one this show

14:49.880 --> 14:56.120
But the surprise party and then see shows up and husband's like, oh, it's you and she's like, yeah

14:56.120 --> 14:59.680
I guess and your husband's like I I get it

14:59.680 --> 15:05.160
I remember you know what I mean? Like you ponzi my dad, but I still love you like yeah

15:06.680 --> 15:09.340
Forgiveness, you know like it's like it's bad like the bad

15:09.340 --> 15:13.680
Who says that who says that who says forgiveness just be watching they both say it at the same time

15:13.680 --> 15:18.520
Oh and you guys awesome dude, and then other people watching kind of like slowly start muttering like

15:21.480 --> 15:24.480
It's just like yeah, this is just like that one episode of one tree Hill

15:24.480 --> 15:24.960
Yeah

15:24.960 --> 15:28.760
Where is that that one exactly literally this exact the other thing that can happen is?

15:29.200 --> 15:35.800
See shows up and your husband looks at you like, huh and you look at your husband you mouth the words clean kill

15:36.880 --> 15:40.880
I'm not gonna let you let it die gracefully through neglect

15:40.880 --> 15:44.200
I brought him here cuz I want you to in this fuck like

15:44.680 --> 15:52.400
Just fucking put the bolt right in its brain in this relationship in the front of done. Yeah, and it clean kill

15:52.400 --> 15:54.400
Hey everyone, I

15:54.480 --> 15:56.480
Fucking hate this guy

15:57.080 --> 16:02.640
Surprise you don't have to do that. No, you don't have to do that. It could just be hey everybody

16:02.640 --> 16:07.460
I don't feel as close to this guy as I used to and I don't think they're

16:07.460 --> 16:11.940
Necessarily worth keeping tabs on and I don't want to feel anything when they die

16:11.980 --> 16:14.660
So I'm just gonna go ahead do clean break

16:14.660 --> 16:19.580
Yeah, and I think if C and I are both being honest neither one of us has been putting the energy into this

16:19.580 --> 16:22.860
So this has just become a wake for our friendship

16:22.860 --> 16:28.140
Oh PS pizza rolls are coming out in three make sure you save some room

16:28.180 --> 16:32.300
I put them in not knowing you all were here just cuz I wanted pizza rolls

16:32.300 --> 16:38.700
I hope there's enough for everybody and if you feel like you do need to choose between me and see just remember

16:38.700 --> 16:40.700
Which one of them's got pizza rolls?

16:41.420 --> 16:44.740
It's me. It's me the real one

16:46.420 --> 16:52.980
Your real friend your real friend, it's my birthday pizza roll team with me you promise you'd never leave

16:53.380 --> 16:57.860
Can we stroll down that that yellow brick road to go and visit the Wizard of the Cloud?

16:57.860 --> 17:03.500
Cloud sorry, you said Wizard of the Cloud again. Yeah. No, that's what I was gonna become inaccessible

17:05.260 --> 17:09.260
Can't make it less accessible than it is currently to new listeners

17:12.340 --> 17:17.620
Actually you fucking don't I don't know why you thought you got to do maybe because I do the best wizard boys

17:18.020 --> 17:22.620
Yeah, you know, okay, not a bad wizard. It's offensive actually because not every wizard sounds like that

17:22.620 --> 17:24.620
Some wizards are just like what's up? Abracadabra?

17:24.620 --> 17:31.060
No problem. No problem. That's fair. Oh, I'm spelling here

17:43.980 --> 17:45.980
It's fun

17:46.500 --> 17:50.740
So this is this one was sent in by gab thanks gab and it's a it's a

17:50.740 --> 17:56.700
Wiki how article that is titled how to make your cousin jealous, huh? Which is which is awesome

17:56.700 --> 17:58.700
I got a lot of cousins and

17:59.340 --> 18:01.540
They've been right a little too high on their horses

18:01.540 --> 18:06.660
And so I wanted to sort of know I want to let them know sort of what the pecking order is

18:06.660 --> 18:11.980
Just a quick reminder a lot of these steps are just about sort of empowering yourself

18:12.660 --> 18:17.980
Like always look your best that's good in general. Yeah, that's a good way around your world jealous

18:17.980 --> 18:22.580
Yeah, but when you're but especially your fucking cousin who thinks they're so cool

18:22.900 --> 18:29.160
There's another step here. It says improve yourself and your life, which I feel like I would need several other wiki how articles

18:29.700 --> 18:31.700
To get a lot of work

18:32.340 --> 18:33.820
Yeah

18:33.820 --> 18:36.020
Why isn't one of the options in there lie?

18:37.540 --> 18:39.780
That would be a much shorter list, huh?

18:39.780 --> 18:46.820
I think it'd be easier to lie then number three succeed in life for focus on school to do a good job in it

18:46.820 --> 18:48.820
Oh, what cousin is like?

18:49.100 --> 18:54.460
Yeah, let me check those grades though. Dumb dumb what A's and B's

18:55.100 --> 18:57.100
shit

18:57.940 --> 19:01.420
Become better than them at something. Okay. All right. Yeah

19:02.100 --> 19:08.540
This is if you realize your cousin likes to paint why not take up painting to practice hard and long until you become better than

19:08.540 --> 19:10.000
your cousin, uh

19:10.000 --> 19:11.060
so

19:11.060 --> 19:12.700
Mr. McElroy

19:12.700 --> 19:19.620
Your gallery opening is a smash hit. Do you remember what it was that first drew you to your aesthetic eye?

19:19.980 --> 19:22.280
yeah, my fucking cousin was talking like

19:23.100 --> 19:24.940
crazy shit and

19:24.940 --> 19:30.740
So I decided to become better at them than painting and that's why I made him open up a gallery next door

19:30.740 --> 19:36.980
That's little and full of his shitty art and I make everybody go from my awesome art building into his awesome shitty art building

19:37.400 --> 19:41.020
Make more friends from school. Maybe even date someone. Whoa

19:41.020 --> 19:43.060
Okay, how did you meet? How'd you meet mom?

19:43.780 --> 19:46.980
my cousin was thinking they were really hot shit and so

19:49.180 --> 19:55.980
Be more mature such as being more alert smarter and acting older than they do that came a little late in the list for me

19:55.980 --> 19:59.500
I think yeah, because like a lot of this has been

20:00.060 --> 20:06.260
Full journeys of self-improvement based on sure competition and jealousy and then the list is like hey grow up

20:06.260 --> 20:12.420
Grow the fuck up if you do that you the rest of the list doesn't matter because you will stop worrying about making your cousin

20:12.420 --> 20:15.620
Jealous eight be positive nine. Don't let him or her boss you around

20:16.220 --> 20:22.560
Ten if an adult asks you and your cousin to do something do it awesome

20:22.900 --> 20:26.940
Damn, you're fucking cool cuz shit you really

20:27.740 --> 20:33.580
Damn it. Damn it. I thought I was awesome, but you're over there mopping cuz my mom told you to shit

20:33.580 --> 20:39.980
This is so far this list boils down to how to make your cousin jealous be better than them

20:40.380 --> 20:46.900
Yeah, right. That's the obvious right put the work in got it. I want the shortcuts. It's like cousin

20:46.900 --> 20:51.300
I see them three to four times a year. I don't need to really do this

20:51.300 --> 20:57.260
I just got to show up at Christmas looking better with a fine partner on my arm and say I

20:57.860 --> 20:59.940
Nintendo switches, right? That's all

20:59.940 --> 21:04.700
Well, step 11 is get a real shortcut. It's just act strong. Ooh

21:05.220 --> 21:13.540
Act sure, that's a good that's a good year or to boil down all the advice that we have ever given on this

21:13.540 --> 21:18.940
program, yep in the end if you had to keep parsing and parsing and dividing and

21:19.780 --> 21:21.780
Eventually you would get to act

21:22.340 --> 21:24.900
strong back strong act

21:25.700 --> 21:29.180
Strong. Yeah, don't be strong act

21:29.180 --> 21:34.820
Strong now what I like about that is that that could be a personality thing, right?

21:34.820 --> 21:36.340
Or you're showing strength of character

21:36.340 --> 21:41.100
But it could also be that you've like bought some inflated dumbbells that look like real dumbbells

21:41.140 --> 21:46.420
And you're pretending to like curl them and it's nothing and you wear like one of those onesies with the big belt

21:46.420 --> 21:49.900
Oh, oh getting canes. Oh, yeah

21:49.900 --> 21:53.900
I directed a Superman musical once and we had an inflatable chair on stage

21:54.100 --> 21:57.420
For this one part where Superman was really upset to demonstrate his strength

21:57.420 --> 21:59.420
and then he picked up the chair and

22:00.180 --> 22:03.940
Every night that kid would just throw the chair off the stage and it left me thinking

22:04.260 --> 22:07.420
Superman would never throw his armchair through his house. That's true

22:07.420 --> 22:11.260
I don't know why he's decided to add this in I don't improve this improv and every night

22:11.260 --> 22:14.180
I'd ask him not to but every night the spirit of Superman would tell him

22:17.020 --> 22:21.820
Act act strong it goes on to say if your cousin teases you makes fun of you mocks you or embarrasses you or even makes

22:21.820 --> 22:24.780
A low comment about you just ignore it and act as if you didn't hear what they said

22:24.780 --> 22:30.060
Also act like you do not care what they negative thing. They said about you. I'm hoping that step 12 is

22:30.820 --> 22:37.400
Now quick get out of that room and just fucking break down crying just just absolutely lose it

22:37.580 --> 22:42.300
Okay, and let it all get it all out and then go back in the living room and it's time to act strong again

22:42.300 --> 22:48.140
That's strong. What's more now? I would argue wiki how I'm sorry that that's act of resilient, right?

22:48.140 --> 22:50.140
Which don't get me wrong is a good thing as well

22:50.220 --> 22:54.180
But I would posit this if you want to act strong and you have a cousin that belittles you

22:54.180 --> 23:00.860
you're gonna want to get maybe whoever the cool uncle is or like the bad boy older cousin or

23:01.260 --> 23:06.380
Somebody like that, right and you're gonna get them in cahoots, right? And when they see you

23:07.100 --> 23:13.340
Getting bullied by this cousin they come over and they say like yeah wimp or whatever and then you turn around and you deck

23:13.780 --> 23:19.220
Cooler cousin or you know, whoever the big one is and then they start crying and they're like, oh, you're so strong

23:19.220 --> 23:24.300
I didn't know you're so strong and then they run off crying and then you turn to a cousin

23:24.300 --> 23:30.320
You're trying to make jealous and you're like, do you want some now now you will have to pay your plant about a hundred and fifty

23:30.320 --> 23:33.780
Dollars American that's the going rate for one of these right?

23:33.780 --> 23:38.860
But if you can establish dominance that way right you don't have to do any of that other shit

23:41.060 --> 23:43.060
It goes on to like another

23:43.060 --> 23:50.560
Series of tips and the tips are how to develop common interests if you realize they like to paint why not take up painting, too

23:50.980 --> 23:52.980
Now this isn't

23:53.980 --> 23:57.260
If they notice that you've taken up their hobby and they say you're a copycat

23:57.260 --> 23:59.580
I can do it better or something the sort don't react to say well

23:59.580 --> 24:02.780
You've been doing it for years and I just started this is literally one of the steps

24:02.780 --> 24:09.380
This is like they've like damn did we explain the take up painting but become better at painting thing enough? No, let's get back

24:09.380 --> 24:10.900
It's already out there. It's getting clicks

24:10.900 --> 24:15.420
We can't change it now, but this is the next thing and is the last tip and so fucking important

24:15.420 --> 24:20.620
I hope we should have put this first because there's probably people out there making their cousins mad jealous and they didn't hear this

24:20.620 --> 24:25.000
Very important thing. It's the final thing and that's remember don't walk up to them and rub things in their faces

24:25.180 --> 24:30.380
You just want to make them jealous not make them hate you. That's so important. That's so important

24:30.780 --> 24:34.580
That's so important. I've never been jealous of someone who's trying to make me jealous

24:34.660 --> 24:37.860
But I've definitely been jealous of people who are just flat-out better than me

24:37.860 --> 24:41.180
So just keep that in mind. You don't want to you don't want to show your hand

24:41.540 --> 24:47.060
Right. You want to make it seem like you care about your own self-development and it has nothing to do with them

24:47.060 --> 24:53.280
And that's the trickiest part because when you get fucking kick-ass at painting and they're still like doing squiggles or whatever

24:53.380 --> 25:00.460
You're gonna wanna make a big deal out of it. I totally get that but then they'll hate but then they'll hate you

25:00.740 --> 25:03.860
But jealousy and love go hand in hand, right?

25:03.860 --> 25:06.860
All hatred and jealousy and love and cousins

25:06.860 --> 25:14.860
I'm just saying a competition is only fueled by like your desire to prove to them that you're better than them

25:14.860 --> 25:20.980
So you care about what they think right? Yeah, and this is gonna spur you both on jealousy can be a powerful force

25:21.580 --> 25:27.620
Look at Picasso and da Vinci. Those two were always competing at each other's fucking throats

25:28.380 --> 25:30.380
But they know you know what they did though

25:30.380 --> 25:34.420
They didn't take it over the top. They were jealous of each other. They never hated each other

25:34.420 --> 25:36.420
No, and they only kissed twice

25:36.540 --> 25:38.100
Yeah

25:38.100 --> 25:40.100
Here's what's fucked up gang

25:40.340 --> 25:42.340
the Q&A segment

25:42.980 --> 25:48.700
Full of laughs the questions are here and they're plentiful if you want to see these answers

25:49.100 --> 25:52.660
These staff researched answers is what they're calling them

25:53.700 --> 25:57.940
You have to pay US dollars American money. Well, that's okay for us

25:57.940 --> 26:03.740
No one should do that. But for us that is a business investment. That's true. We couldn't claim it is name your own price

26:03.740 --> 26:07.860
It is name your own price. Well, that's like that price starts at $1

26:07.860 --> 26:14.100
Which I don't know that looking at what internet people say how to make cousins jealous is worth that much money

26:14.100 --> 26:18.420
I don't know if we could talk to our financial experts and say oh gang

26:18.420 --> 26:22.060
It looks like you wrote off $1 on wikiHow so we are going to be audited

26:22.660 --> 26:24.540
terribly

26:24.540 --> 26:28.780
Hey guys, my cousin is rude and disrespectful. I told my mom, but she won't address the problem. What do I do?

26:28.780 --> 26:33.460
I don't fucking know your cousin better. I guess so

26:34.620 --> 26:38.600
Here's another question. My wife and I used to participate in a trivia night at a nearby dive bar

26:41.860 --> 26:43.860
Shitty beer

26:44.580 --> 26:46.580
Doors on the stalls

26:47.300 --> 26:49.540
Team names, I don't I don't remember

26:49.540 --> 26:55.460
The one that Dwight and me and Sid and everybody used to do was there are received bird is two for trivia. Yeah

26:56.260 --> 26:58.260
That's pretty good. That's a good one

26:59.020 --> 27:03.660
Anyway with trivia night prizes for winning rounds varied from gift cards to food and drink

27:04.260 --> 27:07.300
We went around and the host of the game came by with our prize

27:07.300 --> 27:12.980
Which was a small scrap of paper that said six shots of fireball. He said we could redeem it at the bar

27:13.380 --> 27:18.100
Neither of us were interested in shots that night, but figured we'd come back later with friends

27:18.100 --> 27:23.460
However, due to a global pandemic. We have not been able to return to the bar in almost a year. It is now reopened

27:23.460 --> 27:25.460
I would like to claim our prize

27:25.460 --> 27:30.260
How do I convince the bartender that I did not write six shots of fireball a scrap of paper?

27:30.260 --> 27:33.380
I still plan on going and paying for food drinks

27:33.540 --> 27:40.380
But I would also like my free spicy drink and that's from does this count as money in Des Moines?

27:40.380 --> 27:44.860
And this is a good question. I think right now we're talking right off the bat

27:44.860 --> 27:51.780
there's gonna be some credibility because if you were going to write if you were going to scribble on a piece of paper six free shots of

27:52.100 --> 27:53.260
blank

27:53.260 --> 27:55.260
Right fireball is never

27:56.620 --> 28:03.060
Unless you're our father who has from what I understand taking on quite a a pinch on for fireball

28:03.060 --> 28:10.320
You know, you're kidding me. He makes it he makes a cocktail out of it and like diet like Coke Zero or something like

28:11.180 --> 28:13.180
Now hold on

28:13.180 --> 28:18.400
Sorry, I'm dry wretching the podcast will resume soon. Fireball does have a cinnamony thing

28:18.400 --> 28:23.200
I can see that going with like a like a Coke like with some grenadine

28:23.740 --> 28:25.740
Perhaps I don't know

28:27.220 --> 28:29.660
I'm gonna find out what this master mixologist

28:32.740 --> 28:36.720
Has not like drank drank no, no, yeah ever

28:36.720 --> 28:43.340
I don't believe he started consuming alcohol on a even semi regular basis until he was 63 not even then

28:44.220 --> 28:47.860
Not even then he told me I visited that full

28:48.660 --> 28:52.140
I visited that fool for Father's Day. You're welcome. Dad

28:52.140 --> 28:57.660
Not that he listens, but we visited that fool for Father's Day and he showed me a place outside his house and he said

28:57.660 --> 29:05.740
Every he told me and my children right in front of my children. He says girls every morning. This is where

29:06.620 --> 29:13.700
Peeps comes out and does a crossword puzzle. It drinks a juice. Oh boy. Awesome. So retirements going well, huh?

29:19.180 --> 29:21.580
And he said that was a straight face I

29:21.580 --> 29:28.260
I just laid down on the ground. It's so fucking depressing because we share so much genetic material

29:28.260 --> 29:32.160
But that's gonna be me in 25 years. Just like anyway, this is my juice spot

29:34.140 --> 29:37.260
Every morning I walk out the back door my house takes six

29:40.420 --> 29:43.780
Well for me it'll be you know kind of a hover crossword, yeah

29:43.780 --> 29:52.060
A holographic, you know, three-dimensional letter cube with hollow my hollow drink. This is where I solve my tesseract

29:57.500 --> 30:01.900
Between that and me having coffee and playing a little bit of video games every morning

30:03.060 --> 30:05.700
You don't probably announce it to my children. That's true

30:08.260 --> 30:10.260
So the listen the

30:10.260 --> 30:14.740
This is money, right? I mean, yeah, this is the thing

30:15.540 --> 30:20.660
This is money, but it's not money anymore. It was money the night that you got it

30:20.740 --> 30:26.800
But now it's not money if you go back there if it's Huntington like they're

30:27.300 --> 30:28.940
This is not the same bar anymore

30:28.940 --> 30:35.300
First off you're gonna walk in and it'll be like stumblers four or five you're down several stumblers at this point

30:35.300 --> 30:39.440
Yeah, and it's not the same bar. They do not have to honor that that said I

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440
feel like if you

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Tell them this story

30:44.160 --> 30:46.040
the vibes

30:46.040 --> 30:47.520
currently

30:47.520 --> 30:48.920
might be

30:48.920 --> 30:53.260
Conducive to in your favor for sure. Yeah, we all want that for ourselves

30:53.400 --> 30:59.520
We want this to be a thing that happened nature is healing for you. Nature is feeling itself

31:00.320 --> 31:05.160
You know what? Let me give you a two-word answer here. I'm strong

31:05.160 --> 31:11.800
I'm strong if you just walk right up there and you're like, so here's what happened, right?

31:11.800 --> 31:15.800
and you just deliver it like it is both a reasonable and

31:16.680 --> 31:19.540
Totally justifiable thing because it is listen

31:21.640 --> 31:26.720
You won you have your side deliver it like it's the truth don't shrug

31:27.640 --> 31:30.360
Hey, I want you to walk up and say so here's what happened

That's what it said here on the letter, but I'm I'm I said, no, thanks. I'm going to Marshall University. Go ahead

35:19.540 --> 35:24.500
So that letter is not going to send itself. It's going to need a stamp in it and on it and

35:25.060 --> 35:31.700
Stamps.com is going to help you do that. It's summertime things are getting back to normal a little bit still in the throes of a pandemic

37:54.260 --> 37:58.820
Enthusiast and we create saw bones a marital tour of misguided medicine every week

37:58.820 --> 38:03.860
I dig through the annals of medical history to bring you the wildest grossest

38:04.340 --> 38:08.340
Sometimes dumbest tales of ways. We've tried to treat people throughout history

38:08.340 --> 38:12.740
And lately we do a lot of modern fake medicine because every time we do a fake medicine

38:12.740 --> 38:17.220
Lately, we do a lot of modern fake medicine because everything's a disaster

38:17.300 --> 38:23.460
But it's slightly less of a disaster every friday right here on maximumfun.org as we bring you saw bones a marital tour of misguided

38:23.860 --> 38:27.160
Medicine and remember don't drill a hole in your head

38:34.900 --> 38:36.900
Oh

38:36.900 --> 38:41.000
Do you want a munch whoa

38:52.660 --> 38:56.580
I'm, so excited to hear this one squad. Can I just do it really quick really quick because I did text dad

38:56.580 --> 38:59.560
Hey, what was that cocktail you made with fireball in it and he responded

38:59.560 --> 39:05.640
Cherry coke zero and free ball and then he texted fireball. So

39:07.720 --> 39:13.240
He's already calls it he calls it the free ball. He's a couple free balls deep at this point. Yeah

39:13.880 --> 39:17.000
Um, I actually have like kind of a survey of stuff

39:17.640 --> 39:21.960
Like a lot of people been sending them in. I haven't done one in a long time

39:22.680 --> 39:24.680
so I just wanted to mention because

39:24.680 --> 39:27.480
Uh munch squad is renewed for another season

39:27.480 --> 39:34.520
Oh nice. Congrats. Yeah, we got brought back. Uh, so thanks to ryan and matt for submitting some of these

39:35.400 --> 39:36.840
and uh

39:36.840 --> 39:39.080
So just real quick just some quick quick ones

39:39.240 --> 39:40.040
All right

39:40.040 --> 39:44.440
Number one and I saw this on one of my main sites for news

39:45.000 --> 39:48.760
And I was first like how dare you okay. So this is a story

39:49.400 --> 39:53.800
Papa john san antonio provides teacher appreciation pizza party

39:53.800 --> 39:58.520
Hey, you released a news story about how you did a pizza party

39:59.080 --> 40:01.560
Your papa john's that's pretty cool

40:02.120 --> 40:08.060
They donated pizzas ending the school year on a high note for two deserving schools in edgewood isd

40:08.760 --> 40:14.760
winston elementary school and et rand middle school donations were made in the form of pizza parties and

40:15.240 --> 40:18.200
This is the reason i'm bringing this to you because you're right griffin

40:18.280 --> 40:23.320
The more I thought about I was like, you know, I think it's kind of wild to teach your own pizza horn

40:23.320 --> 40:30.680
But this is why corporations do charity, right? They want they want the attention and are giving it to them and the cycle is complete

40:30.760 --> 40:32.760
I don't know. It's kind of a cynical way of looking at it

40:34.040 --> 40:36.040
Well, the wheel keeps on spinning

40:36.280 --> 40:38.840
But here's the part where I had to stop for a second

40:39.940 --> 40:42.840
donations were made in the form of pizza parties

40:43.720 --> 40:49.400
And a visit from mr. Slice, huh? The franchise mascot. Oh

40:50.600 --> 40:51.480
Hey

40:51.480 --> 40:54.040
Hey, wait a minute. Huh? Wow

40:54.680 --> 40:56.680
Can we all did we just?

40:57.480 --> 40:59.480
Sorry, did you say?

40:59.560 --> 41:01.560
the papa john's mascot

41:04.120 --> 41:07.080
I would actually say it's even wilder than that

41:07.400 --> 41:13.400
This is a specific franchise in san antonio that said hey, do you know how papa john's doesn't have a mascot?

41:13.800 --> 41:19.080
Fuck that. No, travis. We do travis. No, actually it says the franchise mascot

41:19.080 --> 41:21.720
It's the mascot of papa john's

41:22.440 --> 41:26.600
Mr. Slice. Okay, I would argue saying the franchise means that

41:27.140 --> 41:33.240
Location. No, sir. No, sir. I'm here to tell you that there is a mascot of papa. John's pizza

41:33.800 --> 41:39.080
His name is mr. Slice. I gotta look this up. What's he look like his name is no you don't need to look it up

41:39.160 --> 41:44.760
I'm here. Just shut the fuck up showing you he's telling you i'm telling you i'm paying you a picture. His name is mr

41:44.840 --> 41:47.400
Slice, he is his name is mr. Slice

41:47.400 --> 41:49.400
His name is mr. Slice

41:50.440 --> 41:52.680
He had he's shaped like a giant piece of pizza

41:52.840 --> 41:58.040
Yeah, it looks a little like because it's impossible to make a good triangle costume. He looks a little deflated

41:58.600 --> 42:04.520
His name is mr. Slice and I will say it is kind of hilarious that they said part of our donation

42:05.000 --> 42:09.800
Part of our donation is a visit from mr. Slice the franchise mascot

42:10.680 --> 42:13.800
So if I search mr. Slice papa john's

42:13.800 --> 42:15.800
Mr. Slice

42:15.800 --> 42:17.800
The first result is a tweet

42:18.840 --> 42:20.340
from

42:20.340 --> 42:22.280
2017

42:22.280 --> 42:27.560
Where papa john's is talking about a spotify playlist that mr. Slice put together

42:28.040 --> 42:35.480
That's the top result the the one right after that is a papa john's mr. Slice costume for sale on ebay. Okay

42:36.520 --> 42:41.320
This is your storied character. This is your franchise mascot

42:41.320 --> 42:45.480
Mr. Slice, huh? Here's what's sus to me

42:46.200 --> 42:47.720
papa john

42:47.720 --> 42:49.720
resigned in summer 2018

42:50.520 --> 42:54.120
so it feels like maybe a year before papa john's was like

42:54.840 --> 43:00.600
Papa john shatner ain't long for this world. We gotta get someone new in here fresh blood fresh meat fresh sauce

43:03.080 --> 43:08.120
Travis you've just sent us a link to a video of someone dressed as mr. Slice making dough. Uh-huh

43:08.120 --> 43:15.500
Uh-huh slapping dough actually has the video describes it. Well, wait this video this video was posted on my birthday 2010

43:16.620 --> 43:18.620
Yeah

43:19.020 --> 43:22.780
Okay, so here's I need you to do well you have to move on to other stories but do we

43:23.740 --> 43:28.780
Please tweet at papa john's and shack and ask him where the fuck mr. Slice is. I want to see these brands

43:29.180 --> 43:32.620
Don't say fuck because the brands won't engage with you if you use profanity. Oh, right, right, right

43:32.700 --> 43:36.780
But let's talk about that on jeffy's place talking about mr. Slice because where's mr. Slice

43:36.780 --> 43:38.780
Now they hide again

43:38.780 --> 43:42.940
I I just one last thing and I will say too looking at all the pictures I can find of this costume

43:43.500 --> 43:48.860
You would think a very large brand would figure out how to structure a mascot costume

43:49.260 --> 43:53.500
So that it doesn't look like a melting rocket pot. No, this is what i'm saying

43:53.580 --> 43:57.900
It's it's a it's a bad costume and I see why they killed him, but please bring him back

43:58.140 --> 44:01.580
We all deserve it. It's been a tough quarantine for it doesn't seem like he's dead

44:01.580 --> 44:04.080
It just seems like he's on the run hiding in san antonio

44:04.080 --> 44:09.120
Yeah, yeah real quick. Just want to do this isn't a joke. I have nothing to read about it

44:09.200 --> 44:14.320
I just feel like it's really important that we're all united in trying to keep tabs on kraft Heinz canada

44:14.800 --> 44:17.760
Because everybody knows that they have been getting buck wild

44:18.320 --> 44:21.600
Uh constantly just constant buck wild attitudes

44:22.160 --> 44:25.680
Um, and I do want to say that this week they decided to churn out

44:26.560 --> 44:28.560

45:20.400 --> 45:24.080
Yeah, and then we got ghost pepper. Oh boy. It feels a little

45:24.080 --> 45:27.840

45:27.920 --> 45:32.240
