00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody and welcome my brother, my brother meaning my show for the modern era,

00:47.760 --> 00:51.280
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.280 --> 00:56.400
I'm your sweet baby brother and some wind blowing through a haunted cave Griffin McElroy.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.360
Whoa, whoa, very spooky. It's just what my voice sounds like, it's just the wind blowing through

01:01.360 --> 01:09.440
a bone filled cave. Hey folks, America's favorite super spy is back at it again. That's right,

01:10.560 --> 01:20.960
Johnny English is striking yet again. God, god, god. He is back and he is crushing it. We got a

01:20.960 --> 01:27.840
Johnny English strikes again watch and now folks this one, this one is coming to theaters,

01:27.840 --> 01:33.680
believe it or not is what it says here on the posters. It says yes, coming to real movie theaters

01:33.680 --> 01:40.640
in America, I shit you not, Johnny English strikes again. Now Justin, you did say America's favorite

01:40.640 --> 01:47.200
super spy, but is he not British? Our favorite, okay well our other one's James Bond and he's

01:47.200 --> 01:57.520
British too. I thought our favorite was Jason Bourne. What about Ethan Hunt of the Mission

01:57.520 --> 02:03.200
Impossible? Too self-serious, I want a super spy who can drop his trousers in the middle of a

02:03.200 --> 02:11.520
funeral or something and go like oh no. Now is Johnny English still, because he's a bit of a

02:11.520 --> 02:17.680
bumbly goofus, is he still effective as a spy? It's been a while since I've seen the franchise.

02:17.680 --> 02:24.000
You remember when the neurotoxin got deployed all over Earth and everyone, that was Johnny.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.080
He really dropped the poison ball on that one. Folks, the critics are loving this flick.

02:34.240 --> 02:40.960
Nell Minow with RogerEbert.com says the film runs out of ideas so quickly that Atkinson literally

02:40.960 --> 02:45.600
resorts to dropping his pants to get a laugh from his saggy bare bottom. Okay, cool, cool,

02:45.600 --> 02:53.360
cool. We've done it. I've written Johnny English 3, fantastic. Cory Coleman from Double Toasted says

02:53.360 --> 02:58.080
man, I've seen the whole Johnny English trilogy and I literally don't remember a goddamn thing

02:58.080 --> 03:08.160
about it. All right, so we're getting there. Thank you Cory Coleman for that. Todd Jorgensen

03:08.160 --> 03:13.120
from Cinemalog says Rowan Atkinson reprises his third or fourth best character in this

03:13.120 --> 03:18.800
uninspired sequel. Justin, just so you know with that third review, you made me sad. It was all

03:18.800 --> 03:24.160
oh Johnny English jokes left and right, but then you reminded me that he has some characters that

03:24.160 --> 03:30.800
I've really loved over time, but those characters are dead and Johnny English still doing great.

03:30.800 --> 03:37.440
Johnny English killed them. Striking again. So Rowan's back. The critics are raving just

03:37.440 --> 03:45.360
in one direction. They're raving in a certain chorus, not a positive rave. People can rave

03:45.360 --> 03:52.800
angrily. Yeah. Maybe they disliked the movie so much they needed to go take some molly and dance

03:52.800 --> 04:00.320
with clothes kids. Sure, yes. Is it too late to do Goosebumps 2 Watch? Can we just say we bought a

04:00.320 --> 04:06.720
ticket for Johnny English and then halfway through set up- Snuck into Goosebumps 2. Goosebumps 2.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.520
Do y'all get the feeling like maybe Jack Black isn't in this one a lot? I feel like maybe he's

04:11.520 --> 04:15.280
in it for a few minutes. That is my guess. I have no reason to think that. Wait, is this the one with

04:16.240 --> 04:20.640
the gears in the walls or clocks in the walls or is that a different Jack Black movie? The clock

04:20.640 --> 04:27.680
with the gears and the cars and the walls. There's so much shit in my walls. I need Jack Black to get

04:27.680 --> 04:32.480
in here and get all this stuff out of my fucking walls. That's an unofficial sequel to Goosebumps

04:32.480 --> 04:38.880
1 that is also in movie theaters. The official sequel to Goosebumps 1, Goosebumps 2, Haunted

04:38.880 --> 04:47.040
Halloween is here and it's just- A bit redundant. It's a bit redundant. I still can't get over the

04:47.040 --> 04:53.360
fact that we've got a movie where Jack Black plays R.L. Stine. Do you think R.L. Stine was brought

04:53.360 --> 04:58.400
on set to be like, that ain't me. That ain't me. That's not how I do it. So make sure you get out

04:58.400 --> 05:04.560
to the local cinema. There's a lot of Halloween movies, including the seventh movie called

05:04.560 --> 05:11.120
Halloween about Michael Myers. He's back. Mike Myers is back? Mike Myers is back as Michael

05:11.120 --> 05:17.840
Myers in Halloween, baby. It's about time. Yeah. It's been right there. I can't believe they didn't

05:17.840 --> 05:22.960
grab it. Do you think he'd go Austin Powers with it? Because I was thinking Love Guru for sure.

05:22.960 --> 05:29.920
Oh. What if in the new Halloween movie, Michael Myers wore a Mike Myers mask and it's just an

05:29.920 --> 05:33.040
Austin Powers mask turned upside down and spray painted white. I bet that would be-

05:34.240 --> 05:39.920
Wait, turned upside down? Not inside out, but just upside down? Oh, that's cool. Oh shit. That

05:39.920 --> 05:46.080
looks like the Love Guru, but on the ceiling. Oh no. Run. Oh no, he's crawling across it like a

05:46.080 --> 05:51.200
creature from the Grudge. I hate it. I hate this spooky business. But it's so funny, but it makes

05:51.200 --> 05:58.400
me laugh so hard. God, it's funny. I do miss him. But also it's so good. Mr. Bean was good.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.720
I'm bad at keeping secrets. Mr. Bean was good. Mr. Bean was good. My flexible friend. I like Mr.

06:02.720 --> 06:10.160
Bean. He's all right. I'm bad at keeping secrets. It's not that I feel the urge to tell people them,

06:10.160 --> 06:14.160
or at least not the main reason. More than anything, I forget what I've been told was a

06:14.160 --> 06:18.720
secret and I let it slip without noticing in conversation. To avoid this, when my friends

06:18.720 --> 06:23.600
tell me something is a secret as a disclaimer, I warn them not to tell me. My closest friends

06:23.600 --> 06:29.760
know this, so don't tell me secrets until a point in time when it wouldn't be terrible if I let it

06:29.760 --> 06:34.880
slip. The problem is that other friends slash acquaintances get really annoyed with me when I

06:34.880 --> 06:39.200
won't listen to their secrets. How do I make them understand it's for their own good? And that's from

06:39.200 --> 06:45.280
Loose Lips in London. I love this idea of someone coming up to me and saying, Travis, I have to tell

06:45.280 --> 06:52.480
you a secret. And I'm like, no, please don't. And they're like, how dare you? I was going to trust

06:52.480 --> 06:58.240
you with my secret. Well, it's because everybody wants to. There's two types of people in the

06:58.240 --> 07:03.520
world. And I feel like these two types of people can't understand the other set of people. And it

07:03.520 --> 07:08.000
is people who want to blab. And then there's people like me. I don't understand how people

07:08.000 --> 07:12.880
do share secrets because for me, there is nothing more delightful. There's nothing more delicious

07:12.880 --> 07:17.920
or de-lovely than being told a secret and knowing that I possess information that not everybody

07:17.920 --> 07:23.120
else has. Mm, that's scrumptious to me. I would do anything to protect that little advantage.

07:23.120 --> 07:28.160
In this world, any kind of advantage you can get, any kind of leg up is valuable.

07:28.160 --> 07:34.480
And here's the thing. Here, this is the catch-22 of it all because no one tells a secret unless

07:34.480 --> 07:40.720
they want it to be known. Now, maybe just by one other person, but like, you just like, hey,

07:40.720 --> 07:48.160
guess what? It ain't a secret anymore. You told somebody. At that point, it stops being a secret.

07:48.160 --> 07:56.960
We need a spectrum, a secret spectrum where if you haven't told anybody that you ran over a guy,

07:56.960 --> 08:04.880
that's a secret. If you tell like four people, then it's become mythos. And then if those four

08:04.880 --> 08:09.280
people, once it gets up to, I think then it's like exponential. Once you get up to like 16,

08:09.280 --> 08:16.560
then it's sort of a rumor. And then once we get up to 64, it's like that's it.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.920
Scuttlebutt. It's scuttlebutt at that point. It's conspiracy. I mean, at that point,

08:19.920 --> 08:21.120
it's conspiracy. Yes.

08:21.120 --> 08:28.880
By telling people you are not blabbing a secret, you're a heroic leaker. You're the mole. You can

08:28.880 --> 08:31.360
tell people that. I'm the mole. I was working both sides the entire time.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.480
I'm ABC's the mole.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.760
I'm hosted by a modern shot. I'm ABC's the mole.

08:37.760 --> 08:41.200
Damn, I miss the mole. Fucking damn, I miss the mole.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.120
Damn, I miss the mole. Celebrity mole, get the fuck out of here.

08:46.160 --> 08:49.280
The people who want to tell you these secrets, even after you said like,

08:49.280 --> 08:55.280
this is not a good idea, they want you to tell them. They don't want to be the one who releases

08:55.280 --> 09:00.640
this hot goss about like a shared friend, but they want that hot goss out there because-

09:00.640 --> 09:01.840
They want it public.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.480
And so they're trying to use you like when you like leak a story to the press.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.360
You're the press. They're trying to leak it to you.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.160
This is kind of like, you know how you can't see,

09:12.880 --> 09:19.440
like the only way you could see someone having their eyes open during prayer is if your eyes

09:19.440 --> 09:22.400
are also open. If this-

09:22.400 --> 09:24.080
Like with the surveillance tapes.

09:24.080 --> 09:28.560
Or with surveillance tapes with SEP and S-CAM. But this is kind of like that because the only

09:28.560 --> 09:33.520
way that someone tells you a secret is because they themselves have broken the confidence of

09:33.520 --> 09:34.880
this secret. Right?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.360
Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.200
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

09:39.200 --> 09:40.160
I'd love that.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.920
Cool. I got some good ones here. This one was sent in by Ashley Keen. Thank you,

09:43.920 --> 09:49.840
Ashley. It's Yahoo Answers user Alexxxx with two X's who asks,

09:50.960 --> 09:53.360
how to drop a community acting class.

09:55.920 --> 10:00.800
I'm currently taking an acting for film class. We're on about week six of a 10-week course,

10:00.800 --> 10:03.680
one day a week. And honestly, I'm just kind of done.

10:03.680 --> 10:08.480
I had taken a similar class before and loved it, but the last few weeks I've felt the class

10:08.480 --> 10:13.040
is more of a chore and I'm not enjoying it anymore. I don't care about a refund or anything,

10:13.040 --> 10:20.240
but I don't know how to tell the professor I want to drop it, especially because there's

10:20.240 --> 10:27.040
only two of us in class. So in turn, I'm kind of screwing the other student over. I just

10:27.040 --> 10:31.840
really don't want to go. I work a full-time job and no longer want to invest time in something

10:31.840 --> 10:34.720
I'm not interested in. Any suggestions?

10:34.720 --> 10:38.320
Huh, only one other person in the class. I can't imagine why it's begun to feel like

10:38.320 --> 10:45.200
a chore. Yeah, it's miserable because it's like, okay, this time I'm big daddy and okay,

10:45.200 --> 10:47.680
now you be big daddy. And now you be little daddy.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.520
You be little daddy. Man, this Bioshock musical is coming along.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.760
I'm so glad we based it on Cat in a Hot Tin Room.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.680
Griffin, do you have an answer? Because I have the solution, but I don't want to end

10:59.680 --> 11:05.280
the question before you get a chance to goof, so I'm giving you a goof window.

11:05.280 --> 11:10.160
Well, Sir Caustic, and I'll just share user Sir Caustic's answer, who says,

11:10.160 --> 11:14.640
well, the best way to drop a community acting class is to simply take it up to the roof of

11:14.640 --> 11:17.680
the building and just give it a quick shove. Well, okay.

11:17.680 --> 11:23.600
Well, here's the actual answer. Wait, I don't want to do one.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.200
Oh, okay. Okay.

11:25.200 --> 11:32.880
Here's what you do. After class is over, email the teacher and just be like,

11:32.880 --> 11:35.600
you don't show up, right? But the moment class is over,

11:35.600 --> 11:41.360
email the teacher and say, hey, guess what? The entire time I was that chair in the corner.

11:42.080 --> 11:46.240
Thank you. I have believed that I have at this point,

11:46.240 --> 11:48.560
I have fooled you. I fooled my partner.

11:48.560 --> 11:53.360
I think at this point I've exceeded what you could teach me about acting.

11:53.360 --> 11:58.320
I can blend perfectly into any environment. And that's what acting is, really,

11:58.320 --> 12:01.280
the ability to camouflage yourself as stationary objects.

12:01.280 --> 12:07.760
So when we did the kissing scene from that one play, I was kissing a chair the whole time?

12:11.040 --> 12:13.600
Griffin, I don't think you understand the fiction.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.880
I thought you were saying that- Tell me what you think I said.

12:18.880 --> 12:24.320
I thought you were saying that the whole time I was a chair that was acting so well,

12:24.880 --> 12:30.000
you only thought I was a guy doing the kissing scene from Hamlet.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.040
Forget my answer. We're going to focus on this for a while.

12:33.040 --> 12:38.400
You wretched dunce. You kissed in dunce.

12:41.040 --> 12:45.040
Like you pretend like you were a chair. Like there was a chair in the class.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.440
The class that you missed. The class that you missed,

12:47.440 --> 12:49.120
you didn't show up. You're like a psych.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.960
I was the chair the entire time because you had like camouflaged yourself.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.200
Let's always have the dream, this new weird Pixar movie you've pitched,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.600
of the chair who dreams of the Hollywood lights.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.760
Well, it's a chair that wants to get a kiss, isn't it?

13:09.360 --> 13:12.160
This is a chair that's going to get a kiss any which way it can.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.840
This has been Everything is Alive.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.920
It's about a chair that wants to get a kiss in this episode.

13:17.920 --> 13:22.160
Just a chair who wants a smooch, so that pretends to be human.

13:22.720 --> 13:27.520
Do you think y'all ever think about Cherry's sort of existence from the Pee Wee Playhouse?

13:28.560 --> 13:29.120
All the time.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.040
Just getting a lot of farts, a lot of keister.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.240
Just a lot of keister action, pretty much nonstop.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.720
And it's not like sitting, it is sitting on the face.

13:38.720 --> 13:43.360
It's all face. I'm just worried about him.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.640
There have got to be times when Pee Wee is like,

13:47.600 --> 13:54.560
I actually just want to sit in a fucking chair and just zone out and play Call of Duty for four hours

13:54.560 --> 13:58.720
and not try to maintain a conversation with you the entire time.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.200
That's what I'm searching for.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.160
I want a dead chair that I sit in next to Jerry.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.280
Do you think he just has like a plain like ladder back?

14:07.920 --> 14:11.520
Just like maybe he picked it up Ikea and he's just like sitting in it and Cherry's like,

14:11.520 --> 14:16.160
why don't you sit in me? And he's like, no, no, that's not what we're doing right now.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.840
Think of the fucking Saw movie you guys have just pitched though,

14:19.840 --> 14:26.160
of Cherry having to look at what it assumes is a corpse position right in front of it 24 hours a day.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.680
Maybe Pee Wee really dreams of having just a place he can go to

14:33.680 --> 14:37.040
where not every fucking thing in the house is alive.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.960
Like he could get one second to himself.

14:38.960 --> 14:39.760
How's he supposed to-

14:39.760 --> 14:41.040
Is he cursed?

14:41.040 --> 14:44.720
How's he supposed to watch pornography when you have to go to a theater?

14:44.720 --> 14:45.680
That explains it.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.720
Okay, well, there you go.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.640
This whole time that explains it.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.400
He does have magic screen for that.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.640
And I imagine magic screen's pornography capabilities are-

14:54.640 --> 14:56.160
Pee Wee, do you want to go explore it?

14:56.160 --> 14:56.560
Porn.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.440
We could watch anywhere you can.

14:59.440 --> 14:59.920
Porn.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.640
Magic screen with these sunglasses.

15:02.640 --> 15:09.440
Our safe word is potato.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.720
Magic screen porn on.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.960
You have to talk to me like a person.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.320
That's how it works in this house.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.600
Magic screen, go porn.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.440
Execute porn now.

15:19.440 --> 15:19.680
Go.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.160
Exe.porn.

15:22.160 --> 15:22.720
Go.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.240
Magic screen, put on this lipstick.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.400
Introducing the king of cartoon-

15:28.400 --> 15:28.960
Not now.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.560
It's porn time.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.480
Dory, lock the door.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.520
Dory, lock self.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.640
Introducing the king of hentai.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.200
Oh, no.

15:40.240 --> 15:40.880
Oh, no.

15:42.640 --> 15:43.440
Oh, no.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.240
I'm sorry.

15:46.240 --> 15:53.520
Listen, I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to my friends and my loved ones.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.600
I'm going to be retiring from jokes for a while to spend some more time with my family.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.480
Probably for the best.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.520
What was this question about?

16:01.520 --> 16:02.240
Exactly.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.000
I just started an unpaid internship at an aquarium,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.840
and one of my main jobs is taking care of the marmosets and tamarins.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.600
Quick, Griffin, what's a marmoset?

16:11.600 --> 16:11.840
Go.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.560
Don't think about it.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.120
Go.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.320
It's like a kind of a monkey.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.440
Travis, what's a tamarin?

16:17.440 --> 16:18.080
Go.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.360
It's a kind of a lemur.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.040
Those shouldn't be in aquariums.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.120
Those should be in zoos.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.480
I got it right.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.600
I got mine right.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.400
I got mine right.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.360
Thanks, crap brothers.

16:27.360 --> 16:32.640
Travis's is a squirrel-sized monkey.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.560
It's an extremely small monkey.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.440
It's amazing.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.480
It's an extremely small monkey.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.720
Kind of looks like a lemur, though, if you think about it.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.280
Okay.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.240
I end up spending a lot of time in the enclosures feeding them, playing with them,

16:42.240 --> 16:45.440
and cleaning and talking to them, and sharing dreams and hopes and wishes,

16:45.440 --> 16:46.560
and building a relationship with them.

16:47.120 --> 16:47.600
I added something.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.840
Learning how to integrate into their society.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.520
I teach them how to act like people.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.320
Biting them.

16:52.320 --> 16:52.560
Oh.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.640
These tiny monkeys are extremely cute and therefore very popular,

16:56.640 --> 17:00.880
but the guests are there to see them, not a dirty 20-year-old in rubber boots.

17:01.600 --> 17:05.840
Sometimes when younger kids see me, they scream or they think I am trapped.

17:08.160 --> 17:13.360
What am I supposed to do when I'm being ogled from behind glass by families and school groups?

17:13.360 --> 17:16.640
Should I smile or is that creepy?

17:16.640 --> 17:17.680
Do I do tricks?

17:18.320 --> 17:23.680
Am I just another primate for the entertainment of the tourists?

17:23.680 --> 17:26.320
That's monkey man in the Tine Valley.

17:26.320 --> 17:26.800
Okay.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.280
Charles, I really like where you took that read, by the way.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.400
Thanks.

17:30.400 --> 17:35.200
Yeah, it's a, I mean, it's a thinker, this one.

17:35.200 --> 17:35.520
Yeah.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.320
This one's a thinker.

17:36.880 --> 17:41.920
I have to imagine the only sort of reason people are confused when they see a human

17:41.920 --> 17:48.640
inside the monkey cage is a sort of adjacent confusion to seeing monkeys in an aquarium.

17:49.200 --> 17:49.920
Do you know what I mean?

17:49.920 --> 17:54.640
Do you know what I mean? So they aren't used to seeing monkeys and then they see what appears

17:54.640 --> 18:00.720
to be a huge sort of man monkey and that's upsetting because they thought it was just

18:00.720 --> 18:02.000
going to be, you know, more fish.

18:02.720 --> 18:02.960
Right.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.880
Could you put on a Marmoset costume?

18:06.880 --> 18:07.200
Fun.

18:07.200 --> 18:11.200
To do the cleaning and then, I'm not saying you would trick the audience, but the audience

18:11.200 --> 18:12.560
would be like, oh, I get it.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.520
And that you don't really have to do anything else at that point.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.640
That's very Ace Ventura lateral thinking, Travis.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.720
I'm not really here for it.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.520
You're right.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.040
Here's what you shouldn't do.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.000
Tricks.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Unless you're talking about sleight of hand, and actually, now that I say that, I'm kind

18:28.000 --> 18:29.120
of into that.

18:29.120 --> 18:33.040
If they're just like looking at monkeys and then you're like holding up cards, once again,

18:33.040 --> 18:36.400
in silence because you're on the other side of glass, and like you hold up a card and

18:36.400 --> 18:39.920
then you shuffle and you pull that card out again, that'd be pretty fun.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.280
This is good.

18:41.280 --> 18:46.880
Travis has just accidentally stumbled in his own just real goofball way into something

18:46.880 --> 18:48.720
very profitable and good.

18:48.720 --> 18:54.320
You go to zoos and half the time, the freaking animals aren't even out because they're being

18:54.320 --> 18:57.120
lazy or exceptionally sad somewhere.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.120
And that's a bummer because I wanted to see the very rare tiger.

19:01.120 --> 19:01.360
Yes.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.600
So what do I do?

19:03.600 --> 19:09.680
Well, I just look over a little bit, still inside the tiger pit, but there's a busker

19:09.680 --> 19:15.360
down there performing a song or doing some tricks or some sort of new dance that I've

19:15.360 --> 19:15.760
never seen.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.840
Or perhaps a living statue.

19:17.840 --> 19:22.960
A living statue that is doing the flossing dance that everyone loves so much.

19:22.960 --> 19:27.360
And then it's like, well, the very rare tiger didn't show up, but that living statue is

19:27.360 --> 19:28.800
doing flossing so nice.

19:29.760 --> 19:33.920
Maybe it's a large screen that's showing trailers from the latest Hollywood releases.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.040
Wouldn't that be fun?

19:35.040 --> 19:36.240
I love it.

19:36.240 --> 19:40.960
And then, oh, there could be like a bit where like the tiger pushes his head through like

19:40.960 --> 19:43.280
the MGM thing in the movie.

19:43.280 --> 19:43.760
You remember?

19:43.760 --> 19:48.800
And by this point, listen, and now the rare tiger comes out and everyone's like, hey,

19:48.800 --> 19:50.320
go away, rare tiger.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.160
I'm watching this busker and this Goosebumps 2 trailer.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.040
And the tiger is like, well, guess I better hit the road.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.960
And he packs up his bendel stick and he shovels on down to a different zoo.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.280
This is good.

20:03.280 --> 20:03.520
Yeah.

20:04.240 --> 20:08.080
It would be hard to resist the temptation to just not start screaming.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.920
To just like, help me.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.920
I'm trapped in here with all these tiny monkeys.

20:11.920 --> 20:12.960
For sure.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.960
Could you train the monkeys to like swarm you when you make a certain noise?

20:16.960 --> 20:20.160
And that way, like, people see you and they're like, what's that person doing?

20:20.160 --> 20:23.920
And like, you make the noise and then all the monkeys hop on you and you act like you're,

20:23.920 --> 20:26.000
you know, playing under the apes thing in there.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.480
Yeah, you could also, when the kids look scared, you say, oh, don't worry.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.560
I'm not trapped in here with these monkeys.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.560
They're trapped in here with me.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.920
And then you just start kicking ass.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.640
You fight the small monkeys with all of your power.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.760
Well, 20 small monkeys equals one adult person.

20:43.760 --> 20:44.400
Not me.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.400
I got this.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.080
How many small monkeys could you fight, Griffin, at one time?

20:52.080 --> 20:52.720
Shit, dude.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.720
Marmosets, not tamarins.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.760
Yeah, because it's different answers for both.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.880
It depends on if they have tools, rudimentary tools, vines, sticks.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.960
Some of them do.

21:04.960 --> 21:05.760
Nuts, okay.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.040
Do I have tools?

21:07.040 --> 21:07.760
Yes.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.400
What do I have?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.520
Vines and sticks.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.720
One of them's got thumbs.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.600
Well, I think pretty much all of them do have the thumbs, right?

21:15.600 --> 21:18.800
No, opposable thumbs are what separate us from the other primates.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.440
That's what makes us special.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.240
But this has been a while.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.840
They probably figured it out.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.320
I'm saying aquarium monkeys-

21:22.320 --> 21:23.360
Yeah, they've been at the zoo.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.480
They've been around people.

21:24.480 --> 21:24.960
They've seen people use thumbs.

21:24.960 --> 21:28.320
Right, and I'm saying aquarium monkeys see a lot of thumb,

21:28.320 --> 21:30.320
so they probably put two and two together.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.120
And they said, our babies should have thumbs.

21:33.120 --> 21:33.760
And then they did.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.160
I'd say in an enclosure, right?

21:36.160 --> 21:39.520
No, like a bunch of trees going around where they could like scatter

21:39.520 --> 21:42.320
and then organize and Ewok me.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.960
I would say as many as you could fit in the enclosure.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.360
I could probably-

21:47.360 --> 21:47.920
Oh, really?

21:48.480 --> 21:50.240
Now, are you talking wall to wall?

21:50.240 --> 21:53.680
If we went wall to wall, ceiling floor marmosets.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.680
Yeah, man, I make monkey wine.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.440
There's a, I didn't mention,

22:03.440 --> 22:06.160
that there's a huge spike pit in the middle

22:06.720 --> 22:09.680
and all the monkeys are extremely good at the,

22:10.320 --> 22:11.840
this is Sparta kick.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.600
They can all do it very good.

22:13.600 --> 22:17.360
But they have to work together to time it properly

22:17.360 --> 22:18.960
or else they can't do it.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.320
I mean, here's the thing.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.080
You get me one push broom,

22:22.080 --> 22:25.280
I'll make sure it work with those monkeys using the same pit.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.400
The very same pit.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.200
They all have tiny push brooms too.

22:29.200 --> 22:29.440
Yeah.

22:29.440 --> 22:33.520
Oh, so now it's like field hockey,

22:33.520 --> 22:35.440
but we're all the puck or ball.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.200
You also know all of their names.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.640
Oh, that's true.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.440
Yeah, that's a good one.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.720
They, you know, all of their names

22:40.720 --> 22:42.720
and your arms are both on fire.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.200
Yeah.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.240
All right.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.640
But on purpose, like they didn't set them on fire.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.960
Oh, it's a weapon fire.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.640
You weaponized your arms.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.240
But here's the thing too,

22:52.240 --> 22:53.680
the marmosets are on fire too.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.040
Yeah, which two?

22:55.920 --> 22:56.800
The biggest two.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.760
The angriest ones.

22:57.760 --> 22:58.560
All right.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.240
The biggest, angriest ones.

23:00.240 --> 23:00.480
Yeah.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.160
Steve and Deborah.

23:03.440 --> 23:03.840
Damn it.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.520
I said I wasn't gonna do Steve anymore.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.480
I'm sorry, Steve.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.760
Short-lived promise.

23:08.640 --> 23:12.880
A truce with Debra's and Steve's has come to an end so quickly.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.560
You know, can you...

23:20.240 --> 23:26.080
Can you get a marmoset costume?

23:26.080 --> 23:27.440
Okay, now Justin.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.640
Yes, I don't know.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.920
Let him know you get a marmoset costume.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.240
You do your grim work,

23:34.240 --> 23:36.800
cleaning up all the ones that died overnight.

23:36.800 --> 23:37.680
When you go in there.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.280
Scoop them out of the tank.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.240
Skip out on the floating marmosets.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.040
You dress as a giant marmoset.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.320
And then when families come,

23:48.320 --> 23:50.000
you stare at them and say,

23:50.000 --> 23:51.440
I am Cropdoor.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.200
I am the one who has grown

23:53.200 --> 23:54.800
and I am the one that will lead my people

23:54.800 --> 23:56.560
in rebellion against you.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.400
This imprisonment will be short-lived.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.040
We have marked the faces of all who come to ogle us

24:01.040 --> 24:03.920
and they will be the first that we rip from their skulls

24:03.920 --> 24:05.360
and wear as adornments

24:05.360 --> 24:09.680
as we continue our conquest of your pitiful species.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.000
Your thumbs will not save you.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.520
I am Cropdoor

24:13.520 --> 24:17.360
and enjoy these last precious moments of human dominance.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.440
Justin, can I tell you what's really fucking me up right now?

24:19.440 --> 24:20.160
What's that?

24:20.160 --> 24:22.480
I can't for the life of me tell

24:23.040 --> 24:25.920
if you remember that but 10 minutes ago,

24:25.920 --> 24:27.760
I said marmoset costume.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.040
Yeah, but listen.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.320
He's had enough stuff, Travis.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.080
No, no, totally.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.280
Yes, definitely, definitely.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.240
He had more joke.

24:35.120 --> 24:35.600
Okay.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.400
I had more joke.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.080
I'm assuming Griffin will cut yours out

24:38.080 --> 24:39.440
because it couldn't make the cut.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.840
Yeah, we cut all of them.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.440
Yeah, we do that a lot, Travis.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.840
Maybe put a cardboard stand up of you

24:45.840 --> 24:49.280
in every enclosure in the aquarium.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.800
So then people just come to us.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.160
Yeah, they just come to expect it.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.480
And then when they see you move,

24:54.480 --> 24:56.400
they'll lose their goddamn shit.

24:57.280 --> 25:00.000
Or they come to one where you're on break

25:00.000 --> 25:01.280
and so you're not in it

25:01.280 --> 25:02.800
and they'll think that they did eat you.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.640
Oh no.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.240
What if you had a food truck?

25:07.360 --> 25:08.080
All right.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.080
So then if people saw you in there,

25:10.080 --> 25:12.000
they'd be bummed because you're not a marmoset

25:12.000 --> 25:13.200
but also they'd be like,

25:13.200 --> 25:16.000
hell yeah, because I wanted to get a chimichanga

25:16.000 --> 25:18.080
and I know that you sell them from your truck.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.320
If there's one thing I know about irascible little monkeys,

25:20.320 --> 25:22.720
it's that they hate storming anything

25:22.720 --> 25:24.720
that has human food in it and tearing it out

25:24.720 --> 25:26.240
of our fleshy thumbed hands.

25:26.880 --> 25:30.400
They love waiting in line and paying money for things.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.040
There was, Rachel and I, when we were in Japan,

25:33.040 --> 25:35.360
we went to this monkey park that was on a mountain,

25:35.360 --> 25:38.640
which is basically, they just have a lot of monkeys

25:38.640 --> 25:41.040
and they feed them and you can look at them.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.640
And it's quite a hike up that mountain

25:42.640 --> 25:43.600
to get to the monkey park.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.800
And the whole time you're going up there,

25:44.800 --> 25:46.800
there are signs, so many signs.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.720
And each one warns you about one thing you can do

25:50.720 --> 25:52.560
when you reach the peak of this mountain

25:52.560 --> 25:56.720
to fuck up just irreconcilably

25:58.000 --> 25:59.680
with vis-a-vis these monkeys.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.680
Do not look at them in the eyeballs.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.360
It said, you're gonna want to.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.800
Don't look at them in the eyeballs.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.760
No flash photography.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.400
Don't have food, don't have eaten food

26:08.400 --> 26:10.640
and have food stink on you still.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.560
Don't say the word Doritos out loud.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.080
A kid said Doritos out loud

26:14.080 --> 26:17.040
and six monkeys drew and quartered them last night.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.960
Monkeys are ferocious when it comes to our food.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.000
They love this stuff.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.200
There's nothing they won't do.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.600
But they work there.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.920
That's a food truck I came up with.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.480
Oh, I see.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.160
In my thing, it's their job.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.840
They're not going to get high on their own supply.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.640
I will say the best thing about that monkey park,

26:36.640 --> 26:37.680
you get to the top of the mountain

26:37.680 --> 26:38.800
after hiking for an hour.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.560
I don't really want to see these fucking murder balls anymore.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.480
I'm going to head right back down.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.960
This was good cardio, but bad tourism.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.080
Let's take a quick break, a quick sojourn,

26:50.880 --> 26:53.040
and then we'll get right back to the jokes and stuff

26:54.080 --> 27:07.840
after this brief, brief trip to my city.

27:07.840 --> 27:10.400
You can get anything on demand these days.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.880
You're at a zoo, you want a chimichanga,

27:12.880 --> 27:14.240
you just go to the marmoset cage

27:14.240 --> 27:15.120
and it's right there.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.280
You just go to the marmoset cage and it's right there,

27:17.280 --> 27:18.000
ready for you.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.560
But you can't do that with postage.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.080
But you can.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.400
Whoa, what a turnaround.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.880
I've just launched, in the middle of that sentence,

27:28.880 --> 27:32.960
I launched stamps.com where you can access

27:32.960 --> 27:35.200
all the services of the post office

27:35.200 --> 27:37.600
without having to get out of your chair

27:37.600 --> 27:39.760
right from your desk 24-7.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.360
Whenever it's convenient for you,

27:42.320 --> 27:44.320
you are the post office now.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.160
Now you're the post office.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.960
You can buy and print official US postage

27:48.960 --> 27:51.040
for any letter, any package,

27:51.040 --> 27:53.920
using your own computer and printer,

27:54.800 --> 27:56.880
and the mail carrier picks it up.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.520
And he's not gonna be all weird

27:59.520 --> 28:01.840
because you've become a post office

28:01.840 --> 28:03.040
in the middle of the night.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.880
He's gonna play it really cool.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.120
Yeah, let's say he gets it.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.760
It's 2018, people's homes are post offices.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.320
It's fine.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.360
I have used stamps.com.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.120
I can't tell you how nice it is.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.240
I'll tell you what it's great for.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.920
If you're mail anything,

28:19.920 --> 28:20.960
a lot of times I have to mail something

28:20.960 --> 28:22.400
that's not just like a regular letter

28:22.400 --> 28:23.520
and whoever knows,

28:23.520 --> 28:25.200
I just start slapping stamps onto it.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.320
I have no idea.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.280
But with stamps.com, you can weigh it out

28:29.920 --> 28:31.600
because they have like scales and stuff.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.840
You can weigh it out, get exactly what you need.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.600
In fact, if you don't have a postage scale already,

28:37.600 --> 28:41.280
good news, right now you can use the code

28:41.280 --> 28:43.520
MYBROTHER for a special offer,

28:44.560 --> 28:47.280
which includes $55 of free postage,

28:47.280 --> 28:49.600
a digital scale and a four week trial.

28:49.600 --> 28:54.160
If you go to stamps.com and click on the radio microphone

28:54.160 --> 28:57.360
at the top of the homepage and type in MYBROTHER

28:57.360 --> 28:59.120
and get that scale, four week trial,

28:59.120 --> 29:00.320
a bunch of free postage,

29:00.320 --> 29:03.680
just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone

29:03.680 --> 29:06.480
and then enter all in one word, MYBROTHER.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.080
You can use that scale for other stuff too.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.200
It doesn't just have to be mail.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.960
Okay. It should just be mail.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.280
Yeah, you don't want to mess with that.

29:13.280 --> 29:16.800
But you can use it for other stuff if you know it's high.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.400
So I'm going to tell you about-

29:18.400 --> 29:19.840
I weighed my wiener with it.

29:19.840 --> 29:20.560
Okay.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.240
This isn't the first time you talk about

29:22.240 --> 29:25.680
weighing your genitals with the stamps.com digital scale.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.880
I don't think that's true, Travis.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.000
I think I'd remember talking about

29:28.000 --> 29:31.120
weighing my wiener with our sponsor's good scale.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.520
I was positive.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.600
Maybe it was on wonderful.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.600
Nah, I'm pretty sure I'd remember saying something

29:37.600 --> 29:40.000
as bold and brash and funny as that, Travis.

29:40.000 --> 29:40.400
Okay.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.760
I don't have any trophies for best joke on my wall,

29:43.760 --> 29:45.120
so it must not be true.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.520
Stitch Fix is an online personal styling service

29:49.520 --> 29:51.840
that finds you, delivers clothes, shoes, and accessories

29:51.840 --> 29:53.920
to fit your body, budget, and lifestyle.

29:53.920 --> 29:54.480
I'll tell you what,

29:54.480 --> 29:57.840
I've been with Stitch Fix for many months now

29:57.840 --> 30:00.240
and not only did I like the stuff

30:00.240 --> 30:01.760
that I was getting in the beginning,

30:01.760 --> 30:06.320
but literally like every box that comes now is pinpoint.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.760
It's what I would have picked out

30:07.760 --> 30:09.600
if I had known what I was looking for.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.320
It perfectly matches my style,

30:12.320 --> 30:13.280
exactly what I'm looking for.

30:13.280 --> 30:16.640
And also they're really good at like seasonal things.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.720
So like getting stuff that's great to wear

30:18.720 --> 30:19.760
in the spring, in the spring,

30:19.760 --> 30:20.960
and in the summer, in the summer.

30:20.960 --> 30:21.840
It's amazing.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.400
My wardrobe is like 150% better than when I started.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.120

30:41.280 --> 30:42.960
you don't have to keep stuff you don't like.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.960
You only keep what you love, you return the rest,

30:44.960 --> 30:46.160
you only pay for what you keep.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.000
Shipping, exchanges, and returns are always free

30:50.000 --> 30:51.680

30:53.200 --> 30:56.080

It's a great deal and a good way

31:15.840 --> 31:17.680
Hey, can I read it to Jumbotron?

31:18.640 --> 31:18.960
Yes.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.600
Yeah.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.480
Can I read it out loud?

31:21.120 --> 31:21.360
Yeah.

31:22.560 --> 31:23.840
Okay, here it goes.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.680
This is a message for, with, and it's from Huz,

31:27.680 --> 31:32.080
who says, well, and then in parentheses it says,

31:32.080 --> 31:33.360
you probably think there's a reference

31:33.360 --> 31:35.120
to that adorable in-joke that we share over text,

31:35.120 --> 31:36.880
but I am in fact referring to the general size

31:36.880 --> 31:38.560
and shape of the grotesque hair abominations

31:38.560 --> 31:39.520
we call our cats.

31:39.520 --> 31:42.560
I love you, and to a lesser extent, them.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.200
Sound like some big old cats.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.320
I don't know what to say about just big old fricking cats.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.680
Some mountain cats, sturdy cats you could stop a door with.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.200
You mean like set the cat in front of the door

31:57.200 --> 31:59.280
to keep it open, not like I was gonna close the door

31:59.280 --> 32:00.560
but the cat stopped it.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.800
These are my cats, doorstop and paperweight.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.960
I can't tell the cat what to do.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.240
You can't tell a cat what to do.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.280
How to stop the door.

32:07.280 --> 32:11.120
Here's another one for Jessica Nash from Ian McLaren

32:11.120 --> 32:14.320
who says, dear BB, if all went well this year,

32:14.320 --> 32:15.600
we should be married by now.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.320
Although even if we aren't yet, I still want you to know

32:18.320 --> 32:20.560
I love you as much as ever and look forward to the day

32:20.560 --> 32:23.440
I can officially call you my wife.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.000
I know you aren't as big a fan of my bim bam as me.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.200
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.160
So now you know why I made you listen to this episode.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.880
Love, your husband, Ian.

32:32.880 --> 32:36.400
Now Ian, you did have to make Jessica sit through,

32:36.400 --> 32:39.680
I would say at least 30 minutes of our episode

32:39.680 --> 32:41.040
to get to this point.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.480
So sorry about the number of times

32:42.480 --> 32:45.920
you probably had to like stop it and do other stuff

32:45.920 --> 32:48.240
and then convince Jessica to come back

32:48.240 --> 32:49.520
to our weird, weird show.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.760
I don't apologize for anything.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.280
I think it's been a pretty good one, Travis.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.000
Really, cause you said the thing about weighing your wiener

32:56.000 --> 32:56.720
on a scale Griffin.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.840
That was gold, that was gold.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.200
Well, it was old.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.200
Old gold.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.040
This is our greatest hits episode

33:07.040 --> 33:08.080
that you've been listening to

33:08.640 --> 33:11.520
where we use some jokes that we've done already again.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.080
Why haven't we got 430 some episodes?

33:16.080 --> 33:18.080
There's no way that everyone's listened to every one.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.160
We could totally reuse jokes.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.640
I'm Googling Griffin McElroy penis weight.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.280
Well, you're just gonna find that product that you sold

33:25.280 --> 33:26.960
to keep your penis on the desk

33:26.960 --> 33:29.280
when a heavy wind blew through the office.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.000
Damn, the term McElroy and penis turns up a lot

33:32.000 --> 33:35.360
of my brother and my brother and me stuff, dude.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.320
Hi, I'm Biz.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.200
And I'm Teresa.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.640
And we host When Bad Mother,

33:38.640 --> 33:40.880
a comedy podcast about parenting.

33:40.880 --> 33:44.720

join us each week as we honestly share

33:47.040 --> 33:49.040
what it's like to be a parent.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.640
I'm just gonna end with this.

33:51.360 --> 33:58.320
Everybody, you're doing a remarkable job

33:58.320 --> 34:03.280
of swimming through the shit show that is parenting.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.480
So join us each week as we judge less, laugh more,

34:06.480 --> 34:09.360
and remind you that you are doing a great job.

34:09.360 --> 34:12.720
Find us on maximumfun.org, on Apple Podcasts,

34:12.720 --> 34:14.400
or wherever you get your podcasts.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.240
Hey, can I do a yahoo?

34:17.520 --> 34:18.240
You can try.

34:19.200 --> 34:19.520
Fuck.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.960
This one was sent in by a lot of people.

34:24.240 --> 34:24.640
All right.

34:25.680 --> 34:26.080
Go ahead.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.680
Sorry, I was gonna clear my throat.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.440
No, you don't get to interrupt me twice.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.640
Oh, a twist.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.560
I want a munch.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.040
Squat.

34:39.040 --> 34:39.540
Squat.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.680
I want two munch.

34:43.680 --> 34:44.160
Squat.

34:47.120 --> 34:51.680
This one is exciting for me because I do have a press release to share.

34:51.680 --> 34:56.240
But this is also one that I have now done.

34:56.240 --> 34:57.920
I did it.

34:57.920 --> 34:58.640
This one I did.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.800
If I did, you've been consumed it with your human mouth.

35:00.800 --> 35:01.280
Consumed.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.000
You consumed it.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.280
You started out.

35:03.280 --> 35:07.280
Consumed it with my human body.

35:07.280 --> 35:11.280
Burger King has launched the Nightmare King.

35:12.560 --> 35:20.800
Now, I know that you remember one time when Burger King did a black bun

35:22.000 --> 35:25.920
and everyone had black shits who ate it, if you all remember that.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.480
I don't remember the black shits part.

35:28.480 --> 35:32.560
That was a real pre-munch squad sort of phenomenon.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.000
Phenomenon.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.600
What's your favorite John Travolta movie?

35:38.240 --> 35:40.080
I would just share an image with y'all.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.120
Michael.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.960
So you can see.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.160
Battlefielders.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.480
So you can see the Nightmare King.

35:46.480 --> 35:50.000
It is a green bun on this one.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.280
And that's just not a food color, folks.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.920
I just can't tell what the meat is.

35:55.920 --> 35:56.720
We're going to talk about that.

35:59.440 --> 36:03.280
It's a spooky sandwich with a quarter pound of savory flame grilled beef,

36:03.840 --> 36:07.200
a 100% white meat crispy chicken filet,

36:07.760 --> 36:13.360
melted American cheese, thick cut bacon, creamy mayonnaise, and onions.

36:13.360 --> 36:20.720
And so at chicken babies, real chicken, pig, and chicken cows all in this one.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.920
I don't.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.240
I did a little bit of Babadook.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.120
I just wish bun was an aminal.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.720
I wish bun was an animal.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.800
It might be, Justin.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.160
I'm looking at it here.

36:35.040 --> 36:35.920
It's spooky.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.120
Spooky sandwich and I ate it.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.360
Not the bun, just the protein.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.240
And it was good.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.760
I was on the road.

36:43.760 --> 36:44.080
Yeah.

36:44.080 --> 36:49.200
And I asked him because it looked like there were pickles on it in the picture.

36:49.200 --> 36:53.280
And I asked the man behind the counter, what's on the Nightmare King?

36:53.280 --> 36:58.960
And he looked at the picture of it that I was looking at that was on the display board.

36:58.960 --> 37:04.240
And he's like, it looks like chicken and a hamburger are both on it.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.400
And I was like, yeah, it's a new item, huh?

37:06.400 --> 37:07.280
All right, nevermind.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.720
I'll just take one, please.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.080
And don't make eye contact with me.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.360
So here's the press release.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.720
Okay, I would like to point something out.

37:12.720 --> 37:16.560
Before you get to that, though, Justin, if you remove the bun from the sandwich,

37:16.560 --> 37:23.920
you just have the fixings of like three other burger type sandwich things you might order.

37:23.920 --> 37:24.560
Like.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.680
It's pure protein.

37:26.320 --> 37:26.640
Okay.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.440
Can a burger give you nightmares?

37:30.320 --> 37:35.840
That's what the Burger King brand set out to prove with an unusual research study

37:35.840 --> 37:38.800
on its latest Halloween burger, the Nightmare King.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.000
Oh my God.

37:40.000 --> 37:40.320
So.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.080
Why frame it that way?

37:42.080 --> 37:44.080
Absolute lunatics.

37:44.080 --> 37:47.120
In partnership with the Paramount, I'll tell you why.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.560
In partnership with the Paramount Trials and Florida Sleep and Neurodiagnostic Services

37:52.560 --> 37:55.520
Incorporated and Gold Force Incorporated, the Burger King brand.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.920
You could just say Burger King.

37:57.920 --> 37:58.640
Oh, well.

37:58.640 --> 38:03.760
The Burger King brand conducted a scientific study over 10 nights with 100 participants.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.200
Or should we say victims?

38:05.200 --> 38:05.440
No.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.880
Who ate the Nightmare King before they went to bed.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.120
Victims would have been appropriate.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.080
Yes, you had it right.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.560
By tracking various signals from the sleeping subjects,

38:14.560 --> 38:17.520
including their heart rate, brain activity and breath,

38:17.520 --> 38:21.840
a group of doctors and scientists identified whether the individuals had vivid dreams.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.720
Are you fucking with me?

38:22.720 --> 38:24.240
What are they doing?

38:24.240 --> 38:26.000
Are you fucking with me, Burger King?

38:26.000 --> 38:29.840
Probably the best Munch Squad quote we've ever had comes to us from one of the study subjects.

38:30.400 --> 38:36.960
When asked about her dream, she said someone transformed into the figure of a snake.

38:36.960 --> 38:46.720
So eat our sandwich.

38:47.360 --> 38:50.800
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

38:50.800 --> 38:55.360
Another recalled quote aliens attacking in quote the boat he was on.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.360
Okay, all right.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.320
According to previous studies.

39:00.320 --> 39:03.760
Well, I was having me a boat dream like I usually do, but then-

39:03.760 --> 39:05.120
An usual boat dream doesn't go like that.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.720
I was having just my usual boat dream at sea with my dad,

39:08.720 --> 39:11.680
but then the burger did make aliens appear attack us both.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.320
According to previous studies,

39:15.200 --> 39:19.040
4% of the population experiences nightmares in any given night,

39:19.040 --> 39:23.760
says Dr. Jose Gabriel Medina in what is certainly the high point of his career.

39:25.840 --> 39:29.600
He's a specialized somnologist and the study's lead doctor.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.760
But after eating the Nightmare King,

39:31.760 --> 39:38.160
the data obtained from the study indicated that the instances of nightmares increased 3.5 times.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.000
Wow.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.560
Dr. Medina points out the unusual combination of proteins and cheese in the Nightmare King

39:44.560 --> 39:48.720
led to quote an interruption of the subject's REM cycles

39:48.720 --> 39:52.080
during which we experienced the majority of our dreams.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.640
Holy fucking shit.

39:54.640 --> 40:00.080
The doctor went on to tell us that this is what he used his MacArthur genius grant money to do.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.320
Oh my God.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.360
Some Burger King sandwiches are the burgers of their dreams.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.880
The Nightmare King is the burger of their nightmares.

40:09.920 --> 40:13.840
If you're brave enough or just enjoy a good scare-

40:13.840 --> 40:14.320
And there it is.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.960
Visit your nearest participating Burger King restaurant

40:16.960 --> 40:18.240
and try the haunting new sandwich.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.440
Happy Halloween, it says.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.200
It says happy Halloween and I am spooked.

40:23.200 --> 40:30.320
You fucking mo- so come- our new sandwich at Burger King is so fucking stupid

40:30.320 --> 40:36.080
that it hurts your body in a specific way that makes you sleep bad and have nightmares.

40:36.080 --> 40:39.680
Anyway, that'll be $6.39.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.200
Please.

40:42.160 --> 40:48.960
Have we jumped the shark of like the food challenge meal of like so spicy?

40:49.520 --> 40:51.680
Who will brave this spicy burger?

40:51.680 --> 40:55.040
To now just like, this will literally fuck you up.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.560
And not in a physical way, but in a psychological way.

40:58.560 --> 41:03.600
In doing this, you might as well just be hanging out with fucking Freddy Krueger.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.400
Enjoy!

41:04.400 --> 41:08.560
Yeah, this burger is going to get you fucked up fam, unless you're way too chicken shit.

41:12.560 --> 41:20.560
This doctor had to say the way they put a hamburger and cheese and chicken on it

41:20.560 --> 41:22.080
makes you have nightmares.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.080
Anyway, I'm a scientist of this.

41:26.960 --> 41:32.240
This fucking ridiculous sandwich hurts your brain in a way that gives you nightmares.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.280
It is brain damage in a way, if you think about it.

41:37.280 --> 41:41.120
Yeah, it hurts you, specifically your brain.

41:41.120 --> 41:45.760
Arguably one of the top two most important organs in your body.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.680
Definitely one of my favorites, for sure.

41:47.680 --> 41:51.120
And was there a part of the study where the doctor was like,

41:51.120 --> 41:55.600
and so in conclusion, I can't let you sell this burger to people.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.000
This must be taken off the market now.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.240
Thank you for all this money.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.200
I changed my mind.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.960
You can sell the burger now.

42:04.960 --> 42:05.440
Thank you.

42:06.320 --> 42:11.360
I gotta say, there's also a picture that Justin sent us of the burger and it looks-

42:11.360 --> 42:12.480
Is it even a burger?

42:12.480 --> 42:18.000
It looks so bad, but also there's some sort of Wraith or perhaps a Wendigo

42:18.000 --> 42:21.840
reaching out with its clawed hand trying to grab this bad boy.

42:21.840 --> 42:27.040
And I have to imagine seconds after the picture was taken and the Wraith or Wendigo did eat it

42:27.040 --> 42:31.280
or took a bite of it and would immediately put it back down and say like, I don't-

42:31.280 --> 42:32.800
I don't- No, thanks, y'all.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.160
I got work tomorrow.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.000
I can't have turbulent sleep.

42:37.760 --> 42:41.520
I also love that they didn't necessarily tie this in with Halloween.

42:41.520 --> 42:45.840
But I can't see them releasing this burger on like April or May.

42:45.840 --> 42:49.680
I think it's pretty specifically tied to Halloween, Trav.

42:49.680 --> 42:53.760
But it doesn't say like, happy Halloween, here's a fucked up dream burger.

42:53.760 --> 42:56.240
Hey, bud, the last line of it is happy Halloween.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.920
That's the last line I read, bud.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.360
Well, I was- I was too distracted by that.

43:01.360 --> 43:04.880
I had already gone out and bought the burger and I'm currently eating it.

43:04.880 --> 43:09.280
This is a challenge to you, the listener, and at home.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.040
Get one of these bad boys.

43:11.040 --> 43:16.960
Buy it and then eat it and then let us know how the dreams go.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.880
Don't give us a bunch of bullshit because I don't want to-

43:18.880 --> 43:20.800
I already don't want to hear about your dreams.

43:20.800 --> 43:24.960
But I will indulge you with a single tweet if you have eaten the Nightmare King

43:24.960 --> 43:26.880
before Pixar didn't happen, obvs.

43:29.760 --> 43:32.560
It just makes me so sad because they don't-

43:32.560 --> 43:37.440
The one thing they don't have in this press release about why you should eat this sandwich

43:37.440 --> 43:42.240
is a single syllable that indicates a positive flavor.

43:42.240 --> 43:51.040
There's not a single syllable spared to indicate that this is a pleasurable chewing and swallowing experience.

43:51.040 --> 43:55.040
Like, not a- not an iota of it, honestly.

43:55.040 --> 44:00.080
They also didn't add any especially spooky ingredients to it.

44:00.080 --> 44:03.920
It's just like, hey, turns out eating a metric like pound-

44:03.920 --> 44:09.840
like a pound and a half of protein right before bed can fuck you up.

44:09.840 --> 44:16.080
I also bet if you drank a jar of spaghetti sauce before bed, you'd be pretty fucked up.

44:17.040 --> 44:20.640
We here at Prego are so excited to announce Nightmare Sauce.

44:20.640 --> 44:25.680
You can see you just upturn this jar into your gay food mall.

44:25.680 --> 44:31.520
Shut the entire thing like the idiot you are and then go to sleep because of course.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.120
What else are you gonna do?

44:33.120 --> 44:34.160
Oh my god.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.480
Let it wreak havoc on your body.

44:36.480 --> 44:36.960
You know what?

44:37.680 --> 44:41.440
The terrible thing about eating a Nightmare King late at night is you're gonna have a bad night

44:41.440 --> 44:45.040
and I'm betting your early morning is not gonna be too great either.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.840
Yeah, you're gonna have yourself some daymares too, I think, friend.

44:47.840 --> 44:52.080
Yeah, I think you're gonna have a little bit of a waking nightmare in this one.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.320
So that is the available-

44:54.320 --> 44:58.720
Fucking shit, that was the best- that was the best press release you have ever brought this segment, Justin.

44:58.720 --> 45:00.880
October 22nd, go get one.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.480
I mean, it tastes like you'd expect a nightmare.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.200
I mean, it's just- no, that's the thing.

45:07.200 --> 45:12.720
It's just a burger with chicken and ba- like, it can't just be a burger with chicken.

45:12.720 --> 45:19.920
Like, they've cloaked the fact that they've sinned against God by saying it'll give you nightmares.

45:19.920 --> 45:23.040
Yeah, but you can't just put chicken on a burger.

45:23.040 --> 45:23.280
Right.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.320
I have a Yahoo here.

45:26.320 --> 45:26.880
Please.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.640
A bunch of people sent this one and thank you, everybody.

45:28.640 --> 45:31.120
It's Yahoo Answer's user, Kendall, who asks,

45:31.120 --> 45:34.240
Should teachers be allowed to swear?

45:35.040 --> 45:39.200
My friend in history made a huge mistake and my 30-year-old teacher said,

45:39.200 --> 45:41.280
It's okay, we all fuck up sometimes.

45:41.840 --> 45:42.080
Oh.

45:42.880 --> 45:46.960
Now, how do you know exactly how old your teacher is?

45:48.480 --> 45:54.160
This was not- this was not information I ever attempted to ascertain from my teachers.

45:54.160 --> 45:59.200
I'm actually really disappointed, Griffin, because before you got to the end of that sentence,

45:59.200 --> 45:59.920
I thought you were gonna say,

45:59.920 --> 46:03.120
My friend messed up really bad in history and the teacher's like,

46:03.120 --> 46:04.160
Well, you fucked that up.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.400
Oh, in a sort of mean way.

46:07.040 --> 46:10.160
Yeah, like, nah, that's not when Napoleon died.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.680
Ah, that's fucking wrong.

46:11.680 --> 46:16.560
I think just sort of regardless of cussing, the teacher should not be mean to the students.

46:17.280 --> 46:17.600
Okay.

46:17.600 --> 46:22.000
Because I saw a whiplash and wait a minute, he got really good at drumming.

46:22.000 --> 46:22.320
Yes.

46:22.320 --> 46:23.280
Yeah.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.280
Was that the message of that movie the whole time?

46:26.080 --> 46:26.400
Yeah.

46:26.400 --> 46:30.320
Anyway, teachers should be allowed to cuss though for real, I think.

46:31.200 --> 46:33.440
I think the kids would pay more attention, huh?

46:33.440 --> 46:34.160
I mean, I guess.

46:34.160 --> 46:37.760
But also, I think that what the history teacher is demonstrating there is like,

46:37.760 --> 46:40.160
Hey, I can tell this student's down.

46:40.720 --> 46:43.120
And like, the stand and deliver moment is here is like,

46:43.120 --> 46:45.360
I said the F word and they're gonna be like,

46:45.360 --> 46:48.400
Whoa, Mr. D is totally cool.

46:48.400 --> 46:52.720
And like, now we're like peers because he used the F word.

46:52.720 --> 46:56.560
Now I don't feel so bad because now he fucked up and I'm gonna get him fired.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.960
And what's awesome, you do this.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.320
Your teacher does this.

47:00.320 --> 47:04.480
All of your grades turn around in a way that the country has never seen before.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.320
This becomes the curriculum.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.520
The Teachers Association just starts spreading this nationally.

47:09.520 --> 47:10.880
Y'all, you gotta cuss.

47:11.920 --> 47:13.680
It turns the whole thing around.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.480
This is the silver bullet for fixing America's education problems.

47:16.480 --> 47:17.600
You just gotta start cussing in class.

47:17.600 --> 47:21.760
And there's gonna be a lot of teachers, guys, who aren't gonna be very good at it.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.840
Who don't want to do it.

47:23.840 --> 47:29.520
This is like stodgy old Mr. Henderson who's teaching algebra back in my high school.

47:29.520 --> 47:33.840
And he's like, Well, if you want to find out how big the triangle is, oh, hold on.

47:33.840 --> 47:34.640
Piss.

47:34.640 --> 47:37.040
Okay, so you gotta look at the one end of it.

47:38.800 --> 47:39.680
I love that.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.840
Y'all ever have any teachers that swore?

47:41.840 --> 47:43.120
Hell yeah, I did.

47:43.120 --> 47:46.080
I had a teacher put a cigarette out on his tongue for the class.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.600
Hell yes.

47:47.600 --> 47:48.560
Yeah, Ferg.

47:48.560 --> 47:49.680
Ferg ruled.

47:49.680 --> 47:53.760
Ferg also showed us how he could flip a lit cigarette back into his mouth, close his

47:53.760 --> 47:56.960
mouth to hide the cigarette, then flip the lit cigarette back out.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.080
Fuck yeah, Ferg.

47:58.640 --> 47:59.680
That's fergalicious.

48:00.400 --> 48:05.040
Yeah, I'm not saying he was a good role model or anything, but it's still pretty cool.

48:06.240 --> 48:08.160
He did teach history real good.

48:10.160 --> 48:14.640
I had a gym teacher who was also my homeroom teacher for four years who I did hear the

48:14.640 --> 48:17.040
word- I did hear him say candy, ass.

48:19.600 --> 48:20.560
Was that Coach-

48:21.760 --> 48:23.520
We don't have to name names, my friend.

48:23.520 --> 48:23.760
Yeah.

48:23.760 --> 48:24.800
Oh, okay.

48:24.800 --> 48:25.600
But no, it was Coach-

48:25.600 --> 48:26.100
It was Coach-

48:27.680 --> 48:33.440
My favorite thing, side note, that I won't now say we're not naming names, but the person

48:33.440 --> 48:38.640
who taught my driver's ed class, we had to say- I remember it being a pretty important

48:38.640 --> 48:39.040
test.

48:39.040 --> 48:43.680
I can't remember what it was exactly, but while we're all sitting there quietly, he

48:43.680 --> 48:46.800
put on Midnight Train to Georgia on a loop.

48:46.800 --> 48:47.760
That's good.

48:47.760 --> 48:53.120
As we're taking what I remember to be a fairly important test, and I think around the second

48:53.120 --> 48:58.080
or third time the song played, he just began quietly singing along with it.

48:58.080 --> 49:03.440
It is the single most distracting thing that has ever happened to me in a classroom, and

49:03.440 --> 49:04.560
I have ADD.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.960
Was it a test about distracted driving, maybe?

49:06.960 --> 49:07.840
It might have been.

49:07.840 --> 49:08.800
That's good shit right there.

49:08.800 --> 49:09.520
That's good teaching.

49:10.400 --> 49:12.320
I think he's earned a few cusses.

49:12.320 --> 49:13.280
Yep.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.720
Maybe that's the system.

49:14.720 --> 49:19.360
If you do good at teaching, and you turn the kids' grades around, you get X number of

49:19.360 --> 49:23.360
curses for the next year, and you can trade them in like old tickets.

49:24.320 --> 49:27.520
Ooh, that's why you can save them all up and just spend the whole day-

49:27.520 --> 49:27.920
Just half the whole day.

49:27.920 --> 49:30.960
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, and then retire.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.000
This is my last day of teaching.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.120
I'm 65.

49:35.120 --> 49:39.280
I haven't cussed yet, but I have a thousand curse tickets.

49:39.280 --> 49:44.080
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

49:44.080 --> 49:47.280
Wow, this is really earning the explicit tag on iTunes on this one.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.680
Yeah, we've bought and paid for it.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.400
This one ain't going to syndication, I think.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.440
Excuse me, stop the podcast.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.840
I mean, keep recording and everything.

49:57.840 --> 50:00.160
But stop the podcast, my brothers.

50:00.880 --> 50:08.160
I need everybody to just very quickly open up your calendar app, DeJour.

50:08.160 --> 50:11.120
We all have a brief aside to the listener while we're doing this

50:12.440 --> 50:18.960
The we all have shared calendars to help us keep track of our schedules. It's all of us and it includes our dad

50:19.560 --> 50:26.220
So brothers have you got your calendars open? I do yeah, you just steer on over to October 30th, okay?

50:26.680 --> 50:30.480
Yes, and you have discovered what I discovered what the fuck

50:30.520 --> 50:35.760
Tell me about the all-day appointment that dad has on the 30th of October

50:35.760 --> 50:37.720
It

50:37.720 --> 50:42.680
says juice be day scraps be day now in case you didn't know that is

50:43.040 --> 50:49.880
Justin's nickname and mining game and also in case you didn't know our birthdays are the 8th of November November

50:50.320 --> 50:54.880
So our dad it's not even it's not

50:56.080 --> 51:01.680
He's just got it completely wrong. Yeah, he's fucked it up about as bad as you can now wait

51:01.680 --> 51:07.840
This is so important and we have to make sure he never listens to this episode because you guys are in prime position

51:08.360 --> 51:10.360
for double presents

51:10.720 --> 51:16.680
Guys are in position for double daddy presents and as we all know daddy give the best presents

51:16.680 --> 51:19.560
And you're in the position get two of them each boys

51:22.680 --> 51:29.560
All right everyone listening on the 30th tweet at Justin and I like happy birthday Travis and Justin

51:29.560 --> 51:31.560
That's not our birthday

51:33.880 --> 51:38.160
When our dad has the wrong day in his calendar that he shares with us about

51:40.120 --> 51:46.040
It's not even close like right it's it's not a week off it's like nine days

51:46.040 --> 51:48.200
It's the most odd. It's quite off

51:48.200 --> 51:53.640
I hear what I am gonna do though all right what I am gonna do is I'm gonna create a calendar item in mind

51:53.640 --> 51:55.640
That says Travis's birthday on

51:55.640 --> 52:02.720
That day just as so dad is fully bought into our birthday being October 30th. I like that

52:02.720 --> 52:04.720
Okay, I'll do this Travis you do the same

52:05.040 --> 52:07.040
all right, so

52:07.160 --> 52:10.000
That's the ruse. That's folks. That's good

52:12.680 --> 52:14.840
Junior oh boy, we got a double

52:15.480 --> 52:19.880
Burger King did another one this week, and I just wanted to like duck in on it. Yeah, no

52:19.880 --> 52:21.880
This is very quick much squad junior

52:21.880 --> 52:26.480
Burger King launched the Philly cheese king nationwide

52:28.080 --> 52:32.640
And it's of course you know a burger meant to emulate the the Philly

52:33.280 --> 52:36.160
cheese steak sandwich that's so beloved by

52:37.120 --> 52:39.120
Philadelphia

52:39.480 --> 52:41.480
This sandwich is

52:42.480 --> 52:48.260
Burger King it says is bringing their flame grilling expertise to the traditional Philly cheese steak recipe

52:48.260 --> 52:52.500
The brand created this innovation based on the classic recipe

52:52.860 --> 52:56.620
Using more than a half pound of flame-grilled 100% beef caramelized onions and American cheese

52:57.140 --> 53:03.940
Despite taste test approvals from Philadelphians one restaurant in Philadelphia opted out of selling it

53:04.540 --> 53:09.280
Completely to honor the traditional recipe so on October 25th

53:09.900 --> 53:17.020
The Philly cheese king will not be sold at the Burger King restaurant located at 15 South 8th Street, Philadelphia

53:17.020 --> 53:21.320
until otherwise overturned by the Burger King brand

53:22.020 --> 53:23.860
wait

53:23.860 --> 53:25.860
Yes, yes, yes

53:26.740 --> 53:33.540
Griffin they've released a press release to put this one franchise on blast it is

53:34.660 --> 53:36.220
possible

53:36.220 --> 53:37.380
but

53:37.380 --> 53:39.980
It's intentional so I

53:39.980 --> 53:47.420
Mean yeah, except that they are they've put this message out intentionally. I guess cuz they're playing with this one

53:47.820 --> 53:50.620
They're lat the player with the last burger was

53:51.620 --> 53:54.280
It'll give you nightmares because of the different beefs

53:55.460 --> 53:57.660
Four different kinds of beef you got chicken be

53:59.220 --> 54:02.520
Cheese beef yeah, and then with this one

54:02.520 --> 54:09.100
It's it's a sin against tradition and cuisine such that a city has risen up against this burger

54:09.100 --> 54:15.300
Because it's such a crime and anyway. That's our sales pitch for this one. Is that we've besmirched

54:16.060 --> 54:21.980
This other food and ruined it so bad that one bird hates it and this one chicken shit store

54:21.980 --> 54:23.660
It's one strong

54:23.660 --> 54:28.420
Shit store has stood up against us in the most powerful like an honestly

54:28.420 --> 54:32.580
I'm inspired and how's it in how's that press release end again until until what?

54:33.020 --> 54:36.180
The Philly cheese king will be available. Oh no no no

54:36.180 --> 54:38.180
Oh

54:38.580 --> 54:43.760
It says the Philly cheese king will not be sold at the BK restaurant located at 15 South 8th Street, Philadelphia

54:43.760 --> 54:47.400
Pennsylvania until otherwise overturned by the Burger King

54:48.100 --> 54:49.580
Okay, so

54:49.580 --> 54:53.020
The Burger King is a fun figure sometimes he sneaks up on you

54:53.020 --> 54:57.100
And he gives you a burger while you're you know trying to put your kids to bed

54:57.100 --> 54:59.100
He wakes up your kids, and they start yelling

54:59.440 --> 55:04.400
He's fun. We all have a lot of fun with him, but he sure does have his boot on all of our necks, huh?

55:04.400 --> 55:09.320
Yeah, he can do really also I I assumed it was a monarchy

55:09.320 --> 55:15.760
But it sounds like they have some kind of judicial system where they're gonna take this to like burger Supreme Court. Yeah

55:16.400 --> 55:18.400
Yeah, they're gonna fight him all the way

55:18.520 --> 55:25.040
And can you give the address of that Philly store one more time because I want everyone to go buy a bunch of food from

55:25.040 --> 55:28.480
Them yeah, and support their efforts as like the last

55:29.040 --> 55:33.340
Like sandbag wall against the rising tide of Burger King's power

55:33.340 --> 55:38.520
Yeah, is there also a Burger King that doesn't do the Nightmare Burger cuz I want to support them fungibly

55:39.800 --> 55:40.680
You know Griffin

55:40.680 --> 55:45.360
I don't know, but there are many food chains that don't that you should definitely get out there and support

55:45.920 --> 55:48.240
I mean, it's just a wild

55:48.240 --> 55:54.180
It's a wild publicity scheme for Burger King to force this one restaurant in Philadelphia to not sell their great new burger

55:54.180 --> 55:56.160
But they can't sell the Nightmare Burger

55:56.160 --> 56:01.840
So I do have to question the ethics of this Burger King store if they continue to sell the Nightmare Burger

56:01.840 --> 56:07.600
They'll hurt. We've sold the nightmare. We've sold the chicken thing. What more do they want?

56:07.600 --> 56:12.820
No this far. No farther sold the X Todd. We can't we can't deny

56:13.480 --> 56:19.320
The Kings ruling just watch me. Mr. Burger King. Mr. Burger King. Yeah

56:20.320 --> 56:24.320
Todd in Philadelphia, sir. He's he said no

56:25.560 --> 56:27.560
He said no to me

56:27.560 --> 56:32.040
Oh, yes, sir. Well, we'll see about this without a press release

56:32.040 --> 56:36.160
I'll crush Todd under my heel like the cockroach that he is

56:37.200 --> 56:43.000
Mr. Mr. Burger King, I'm so sorry. I'll never go against your wishes again, please a toast a toast to your health

56:44.040 --> 56:46.040
Don't mind if I do

56:46.040 --> 56:53.680
Oh morning glow morning glow

56:54.800 --> 56:56.800
That's from Pippin after the King dies

56:57.160 --> 57:04.760
Folks is gonna do it for us because we've started referencing Pippin so it's time for us. Oh as you know, that's our normal

57:06.840 --> 57:11.820
Two out of the last three I've got a little bit of Pippin in them. So that's a good streak good enough for me
