00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.160
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.160 --> 00:52.000
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.840
I'm your babiest baby baby, Griffin McElroy. Back in the saddle, fuck nuts. Sorry, I just wanted to

00:57.840 --> 01:04.480
say back in the saddle. I just got back from a brunch with Arnani. Oh, how's she? She is doing

01:04.480 --> 01:10.240
well. She is- has been in town for the week, uh, and we just got- we went to Black Sheep for brunch,

01:10.240 --> 01:16.960
and I was instructed to give you guys these two kisses. Which- which one did I- The first one was

01:16.960 --> 01:20.400
for Travis, and the second one was for Griffin. I wanted- I went to brunch, what did you have?

01:20.400 --> 01:24.880
I wanted the second one, so I'm happy about how that turned out. Did that one sound more-

01:24.880 --> 01:29.520
The first one was pretty dry, and if I'm gonna get an Arnani kiss, I want those wet smackers.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.720
Is that a- is that a scared laugh, or was it an uncomfortable laugh? It's a little bit of- it's

01:34.720 --> 01:39.120
sort of in the middle there. Um, Justin, your hands are on the issue. What did you have for brunch?

01:39.120 --> 01:47.200
Inquire him. I- listen, I had chicken and waffles. Nice. The chicken is in, uh, Honey Nut Cheerios.

01:48.160 --> 01:54.320
Don't mind if I do. Not. Don't mind if I do. Like, wait, just like a bowl of cereal? No,

01:54.320 --> 01:59.120
it's like ground up and fried in that. How about I do that with you? That sounds wonderful. What

01:59.120 --> 02:05.680
did our sweet Nani get? Sweet Nani got blueberry, uh, uh, french toast. It was so sweet, she asked

02:06.400 --> 02:11.920
for more syrup. There wasn't enough. She got sweet- She got sweet teeth. She got a bunch of sweet

02:11.920 --> 02:17.200
teeth in those wet lips. Also, she told me that she's really into Arrow and is looking forward

02:17.200 --> 02:23.840
to checking out Flashed. We can't- All the CW programming, Arnani is down with it, so if you've

02:23.840 --> 02:29.920
got any questions about Arrow or the Flash, check out Arnani's podcast on TV with Nani.

02:30.640 --> 02:35.040
She into Harda Dixie? Is she all caught up on Harda Dixie? Yeah, you know she's into Harda Dixie.

02:35.040 --> 02:40.720
I think that's how she got her foothold in the CW network. Uh, listen, as funny as this has all been-

02:40.720 --> 02:47.200
Has it? I want to help people. That's what we came here to do. It's been a while since we've

02:47.200 --> 02:52.640
recorded an episode remotely. Want to say another huge thank you to everybody, uh, who came out to

02:52.640 --> 03:00.080
the live shows at New York at the People's Improv Theater. Thank you. Thank you for all the gifts.

03:00.080 --> 03:04.640
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I want to say thank you again to Prohibition Bakery. I've been talking about their

03:04.640 --> 03:10.400
alcoholic cupcakes, like, since we got back. I've been preaching the good word. And that nice couple

03:10.400 --> 03:17.440
from Florida that, like, shipped Diet Cheerwine to New York to give to us. Amazing. So many

03:17.440 --> 03:22.880
sweethearts. So many sweethearts. And we got some, like, glorious, like, gourmet chocolates,

03:22.880 --> 03:27.680
and I cannot remember who they're from. So if they're from you, send me an email or a tweet

03:27.680 --> 03:32.880
and let me know so I can- Sorry, guys. Y'all send us too many gifts. Uh, and, uh, Justin Gray was

03:32.880 --> 03:38.080
there. He gave us some art. Oh, yeah. That's that he- That shit's so- I'm framing that. Oh, and for

03:38.080 --> 03:42.880
the- For the people that asked, the merch that was available during the live show will be available,

03:42.880 --> 03:51.600
uh, for sale online as well, uh, but not until after the L.A. live show. Um, yeah. We'll be-

03:51.600 --> 03:57.440
we'll be deploying those other two live shows and our upcoming L.A. live show, which sold out

03:57.440 --> 04:03.600
in, I think, 11 minutes. So thank you for that, Los Angeles. Um, we'll be putting all those up

04:03.600 --> 04:07.520
eventually, um, as- Yeah. As- As the need arises. We're trying to break it up because we know that

04:07.520 --> 04:12.160
live shows aren't everybody's bag, so we're trying to, like, intersperse- I'm sorry that the audio

04:12.160 --> 04:18.640
quality wasn't, like, awesome. We- We were hard pressed to find a good solution for that, um,

04:18.640 --> 04:25.120
but that's- that's- And we originally had more time to tech the show, but because we did a 1.30

04:25.120 --> 04:31.440
show- Yeah. We had to rush it 1.30. Good job, everybody. Well, and that's gonna be the episode,

04:31.440 --> 04:36.080
so thank you guys very much, uh, and we'll talk to you next week. This is the new face of my

04:36.080 --> 04:40.480
brother, my brother, me. We can play for four minutes. Wait, well, we gotta do ads. So we'll

04:40.480 --> 04:44.400
edit in ads between the two minutes of complaining. Two minutes up top, two minutes at the back.

04:44.400 --> 04:50.560
I love nature boxing, but fucking hate everything else. Bleh. Let's help people. That's what we

04:50.560 --> 04:55.680
came here to do. I recently had to kill some time waiting for a friend to get home and decided to

04:55.680 --> 05:02.160
get some Taco Bell. Oh, the best way to pass time. I relaxed in my car in the parking lot

05:02.160 --> 05:08.720
to listen to some bim-bam-bim-bam. Name of our show. Got it. Eat tacos while I waited for my

05:08.720 --> 05:14.400
friend to get home. Once I was done with- I love this question. Once I was done with my tacos,

05:14.400 --> 05:18.720
I was still hungry. Would it be weird for me to go back in and get some more drive-thru tacos

05:19.360 --> 05:24.080
knowing that the girl in the window just saw me there like ten minutes ago?

05:27.040 --> 05:31.360
Yeah, fucked up. I think you can pull it off- when you roll up to the window, you just say,

05:31.360 --> 05:37.440
again. Again. That's- hit me again, bar taco tender. I'm gonna have to cut you off, sir.

05:37.440 --> 05:42.800
You've had three Doritos Lopez. I think this is from fretful fourth meal, but I think you mean

05:42.800 --> 05:50.000
fifth, technically speaking. If you have another fourth meal, that makes it your fifth meal or 4.5.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.080
Your eighth meal, possibly. I think it's wonderfully sweet of you to worry about this.

05:56.080 --> 06:03.040
If you think that you are like the only person that day that did that, then you're a little

06:03.040 --> 06:09.760
naive, my friend. Hey, Sheila. Yeah, I'm scooping back around for a double dip. Oh, Tony. Hi, sir.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.760
Welcome to Taco Bell. What would you like? Oh, you know what I fucking like. That same shit,

06:13.760 --> 06:20.400
one moguian. Can I get the berry one moguian special? Barry, we have asked you repeatedly

06:20.400 --> 06:26.240
to just order twice as much food, but I like it to stay warm. It's cold by the time I get to number

06:26.240 --> 06:31.920
six. Let me get the number 18. Do you mean two number nines? One moguian. All right. I actually

06:31.920 --> 06:37.520
mean six number threes. Actually, however you want to break it up, it's all pretty.

06:39.280 --> 06:44.480
Can I get a 30 of your Doritos Locos, please? Por favor. Grazie.

06:48.480 --> 06:53.200
How late is your friend that you had time to drive to Taco Bell, drive back to your home,

06:53.200 --> 06:57.280
and then contemplate driving back to Taco Bell? You know what's the craziest part of this question

06:57.280 --> 07:02.560
is, I got some time to kill, I'll go eat some shitty taco. Typically, you do that when your

07:02.560 --> 07:10.000
gut needs sustenance or gym mats, which is the more accurate. I need to put ground up gym mats

07:10.000 --> 07:18.160
in my tummy. We've had a lot of fun here today. I want to call BS on this question. There has never

07:18.160 --> 07:23.920
been a human on planet Earth that has finished eating Taco Bell and thought, that's a decision

07:23.920 --> 07:29.600
I'd make again. If I could play that again, I'd play it the exact same way. I think I'd really

07:29.600 --> 07:32.640
play it one last time. Hey, you know what? You know what? I just did a perfect job.

07:34.160 --> 07:38.720
I did a perfect job in that Taco Bell drive through. I think at that point, you have to go

07:38.720 --> 07:43.040
back and just ask for a sack full of Senna twists or whatever they're called. Just like,

07:43.040 --> 07:48.960
I'm back for dessert. You tempted me with your dessert menu. Are Senna twists just churros that

07:48.960 --> 07:55.680
they chopped up? Yes. They're just murdered churros. I wish they'd be more forthcoming about

07:55.680 --> 08:00.000
that. I think they have real ass churros now, but it's like, you know, it's the Taco Bell style,

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
so they're like in Doritos. It's a bunch of cinnamon twists glued together.

08:06.800 --> 08:12.640
I made you a composite churro. Enjoy it. We ground up Senna twists, then batter dipped

08:12.640 --> 08:18.640
a chicken tender in it, then fried it. It's a churro. Here's the second one. That sounds baller.

08:18.640 --> 08:22.240
It sounds fucking really good, actually. That's on the breakfast menu, I think.

08:23.120 --> 08:28.080
Just put on a large mustache and a sombrero. That's racist.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.240
It's a disguise. It's not. Yeah, super racist disguise. Wow,

08:32.240 --> 08:39.040
somebody went to the McLemore school of fast food disguises. It was an accident. It was an accident.

08:39.040 --> 08:43.120
I went to Taco Bell in a super racist Mexican costume. It was an accident.

08:43.120 --> 08:49.440
Okay, you got to go through and say, I've traveled back in time to find myself from the past. Did

08:49.440 --> 08:55.600
you see me come through here earlier? Also, can I get a composite churro? Can I have exactly?

08:55.600 --> 09:01.520
I'll have what he's having. Past me, I mean. The only way I can track myself down is to eat the

09:01.520 --> 09:06.800
exact same thing past me ate, and then see the feelings that leads, what buildings that lead.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.560
Have you guys seen Looper? It's exactly that. I'll eat-

09:10.560 --> 09:16.000
Except you're going to Taco Bell, so it's Pooper. I'll eat what he ate, and then get on the

09:16.000 --> 09:19.920
interstate, driving the same direction he was driving, and then I will know where he stopped

09:19.920 --> 09:30.000
to have diarrhea. Y'all want a Yahoo? Yeah. I think that helped.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.720
Didn't. This Yahoo was sent in by EmeraldMember, level 14, Yahoo shaman,

09:36.720 --> 09:42.480
Drew Davenport. Thank you, Drew. It's by Yahoo Answers user, Nick, who has a 0% score on Yahoo.

09:42.480 --> 09:50.320
But he scored Nick? What? That's his username? His name is Nick. I just thought that that would go

09:50.320 --> 09:55.840
quick. Oh, I don't know if they have to be unique, because there's somebody here named Michael,

09:55.840 --> 10:04.800
which, and a Frank, and a Chantel. Anyway, Nick asks, how come my uncle thinks that my hobby is

10:04.800 --> 10:14.160
stupid and weird? I am an elevator enthusiast, and I film myself going up and down in an elevator

10:14.160 --> 10:20.960
and upload it to YouTube. I like riding high-rise elevators in office buildings, and I get a lot of

10:20.960 --> 10:26.720
money in my hobby. My uncle thinks that my hobby is stupid and weird and is a waste of money. He

10:26.720 --> 10:32.640
thinks that paying for gas and parking is a waste of money. Most of the time, I only have to pay $5

10:32.640 --> 10:38.240
for parking at an garage in downtown of any city I go to. How come my uncle thinks that my hobby is

10:38.240 --> 10:45.120
weird and stupid and is a waste of money? Listen, I want to be super clear here. Please. Because

10:45.120 --> 10:50.400
if Roman Mars has taught me anything, there's some amazing shit when it comes to architecture,

10:50.400 --> 10:54.400
and I imagine the way that elevators work, it's super cool, and you could find something like

10:54.400 --> 11:01.280
old-timey, like they had an elevator operator, and they're super cool and awesome. The idea of

11:01.280 --> 11:08.400
filming oneself riding an elevator for the enjoyment of others is the stupidest thing

11:08.400 --> 11:15.520
I've ever heard. I don't give a fuck if it's a glass-bottom elevator that goes up Tokyo Tower

11:15.520 --> 11:21.040
at night. Oh, it's so beautiful. I would not watch that fucking video on YouTube. Also,

11:21.040 --> 11:25.840
that situation does exist because almost all elevators are little windowless coffins that

11:25.840 --> 11:31.520
you lock yourself in for 20 seconds. Hey, speaking of, did you guys hear about Willis Tower?

11:32.080 --> 11:39.360
Oh, but the glass- Oh, fuck. Yes. Holy shit. Willis Tower, uh, nay, Sears Tower in Chicago.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.840
The tallest tower basically in the world. If we give in to calling it Willis Tower,

11:43.840 --> 11:50.400
then what hope is there for our children? Sears Tower. Sears Tower has these glass overhangs

11:52.080 --> 11:55.360
that were supposed to hold up to five tons, and you go out and you stand on them, and then you

11:55.360 --> 12:00.720
just look down, and then it's nothing but net. And by net, I mean falling death. And you stand out

12:00.720 --> 12:07.200
there. Justin Travis and I had giant tanooki balls, and we got out there like, what's up?

12:07.200 --> 12:11.920
Just us in free space. And we took all kinds of pictures like, look how cool we are. We'll never

12:11.920 --> 12:18.240
die. Somebody took a picture of their last week, glass broke in the bottom. Didn't shatter. They

12:18.240 --> 12:25.680
didn't fall through, but they are crunch? Later. I guess I'll weigh five tons. Time to get on CrossFit.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.920
Can you imagine being the employees up there when it's like,

12:30.960 --> 12:35.040
Oh no, go, go, no, go ahead. Oh, come on. That little girl's doing it. What are you, a puss- Oh,

12:35.040 --> 12:42.720
shit. I, I led to the death of a family of four. Not again. Do you know, like, how different my

12:42.720 --> 12:48.960
life is now that I have a child on the way versus then? At that exact- Jesus Christ. My wife stuck

12:48.960 --> 12:54.640
out behind me and scared the shit out of me. I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about

12:54.640 --> 12:59.840
something else. It's okay. Hi. All right. Bye, sweetheart. Good radio. What just happened?

13:00.560 --> 13:04.560
Sydney literally stuck up behind me and scared- It's okay. We'll edit this part out. That's a nice

13:04.560 --> 13:09.920
moment. I'm going to leave that in. That was a nice moment. I love it. I'm very frightful.

13:09.920 --> 13:15.280
Talk about how much your life has changed. Yes. Oh, thank you. That's right. It's crazy how much

13:15.280 --> 13:19.520
my life has changed now that I have a child on the way. When we did that initially, it was right

13:19.520 --> 13:25.520
before our first Chicago live show and I, or our only Chicago live show, I guess. And I just jumped

13:25.520 --> 13:31.120
out there and took the picture and didn't give it a second thought. Is that how that happened? I

13:31.120 --> 13:35.120
wasn't scared at all. I was the one who was terrified. Travis was terrified. I mean, I don't

13:35.120 --> 13:41.280
give a shit. Today, if you asked me to do that today, not only would I not take the stupid

13:41.280 --> 13:47.360
elevator up to the top, I would like, who's that guy welding shut all the doors to the weird glass

13:47.360 --> 13:52.240
breakable coffins? Oh, that's old man McElroy. This is what he does in his days. He tries to

13:52.240 --> 13:59.680
keep people from dying 24 hours a day. That would be me now. No way I do that. Let's talk about this.

13:59.680 --> 14:06.080
Does it matter? That seems like an irrational fear to me to like go up Willis tower and be like

14:06.080 --> 14:12.560
afraid because really all it takes is maybe three stories and you're done. So three stories for me,

14:12.560 --> 14:20.400
my bones, my lactose intolerant calcium deficient bones, two stories and I'm, I'm gonzo. I'm done.

14:20.400 --> 14:25.040
Basically Humpty Dumpty. I am Humpty Dumpty with these fucking unbreakable breakable bones.

14:25.040 --> 14:33.040
Uh, anyway, elevator video monetization. What's this guy's secret and how can I get some of that

14:33.040 --> 14:38.160
elevator video money? You think there's a market demanding this kind of coverage? He says he makes

14:38.160 --> 14:43.760
lots of money doing it. Okay. He doesn't, but I think maybe what it is is for people who are

14:43.760 --> 14:48.880
scared about it, that they can like get over it, check out what the elevator is going to be like

14:48.880 --> 14:53.760
before they go. Or do you think it's a weird like fetish? Uh, always forever. Everything's a fetish.

14:53.760 --> 14:58.320
Everything, every moment you see in magazines, television is fulfilling somebody's weird fetish.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.920
I think it's like a big, big like cable fed pussy.

15:04.800 --> 15:10.560
Cause if you think about like the, if you think about it, like if you think about like this,

15:10.560 --> 15:15.200
if you think about it, then there's like, it's connected to like the pulley

15:15.200 --> 15:21.600
by those wires could be like, like, um, fallopian tubes. That's why you said that dirty word very

15:21.600 --> 15:32.720
quietly Griffin. What I'm saying is that women's it goes vagina, which connects the fallopian tube.

15:32.720 --> 15:41.280
That's the wire. That's correct. And then the fallopian tube connects to the zygote and that's

15:41.280 --> 15:46.880
where the baby comes out of. That's correct. Nailed it. And the clitoris is the button for the 13th

15:46.880 --> 15:55.520
floor. Cause it does not exist. Oh, what? Maybe I'll try jerking off to this. Like maybe something's

15:55.520 --> 16:02.000
got to work for you. God, what's it going to be? Gumball machines. I have entered a phase of my

16:02.000 --> 16:08.080
life where I'm dating a lot. Nice. When I take nice, you're doing it. I take a late, uh, when I

16:08.080 --> 16:16.320
take a lady out to a nice restaurant, where do I sit? Do I sit next to her hand holding or do I sit

16:16.320 --> 16:20.640
across from her to look her in the eye and have room to eat my food? That's from which side in

16:20.640 --> 16:28.640
Wichita. Always across the table. I disagree. Disagree. Disagree. So I thought predictably,

16:28.640 --> 16:32.560
predictably, I thought this would be the result. That's why I included this question. A disagree.

16:32.560 --> 16:38.800
Here's the thing. Ditto. If I may, I agree with you. If it's like a first, second, third date,

16:38.800 --> 16:43.520
I love sitting on the same side as Teresa and talking about all the other couples in the

16:43.520 --> 16:48.000
restaurant. If you can't, if I'm, I'm, I'm literally, I know this is actually an old man.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.760
I'm literally at a point now where I don't hear as well. Like if I'm, if I'm across the table,

16:52.320 --> 16:57.280
it, I feel like I'm shouting the whole time and I can't hear. I like to just snuggle right up

16:57.280 --> 17:01.680
in that, in that other seat. Why waste a whole booth? We're not children. If we sit across from

17:01.680 --> 17:08.960
each other, Teresa can see me eating, which is not, it's not good. Look, no, not for continued

17:08.960 --> 17:13.680
marital bliss. The other thing I like about sitting on the same side is that I can demand

17:13.680 --> 17:18.320
fruitlessly that the waitress seat another couple in the adjoining side of the booth.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.440
Can you mix it up? Can you mix it up just enough to mix doubles?

17:21.440 --> 17:23.360
We need euchre partners. Can you please?

17:24.480 --> 17:27.360
We're, we're trying to make new friends at Max and Irma's.

17:27.360 --> 17:28.560
I was just sitting-

17:28.560 --> 17:30.000
Could you send out Max and Irma?

17:31.840 --> 17:38.000
I've been sitting here like literally slack jawed with shock. I can't bel- I didn't think

17:38.000 --> 17:42.640
I didn't think anybody did that. I didn't think anybody did that.

17:42.640 --> 17:50.320
Eye contact is so much more, I'll just say it, erotic than hand holding. So you look into the

17:50.320 --> 17:56.000
windows of her soul and you have that going for you. It's easier, like sound, you don't have to

17:56.000 --> 18:01.520
like turn your neck to the left or right to like talk to them. Both of you have instant

18:01.520 --> 18:05.520
bathroom access. That's not a joke.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.000
I know it's not.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.840
I'm surprised that you, Justin, I'm surprised that you most of all, Tin Man,

18:11.840 --> 18:14.320
that you're not keeping your exits wide, vis a vis bathroom.

18:14.320 --> 18:18.000
Ah, do you think I'm ever on the inside? Let me disabuse you.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.680
Well, now you've got a, your wife is pregnant. She probably goes to the bathroom

18:22.240 --> 18:25.520
more than you, which is a fact that I never thought would be true.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.880
I am happy to let her out. She can get out if she wants.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.760
You're so kind.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.840
That's, this is, I can't-

18:31.840 --> 18:37.600
You don't make your pregnant wife crawl under the table. No, not unless I drop a breadstick.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.960
I can't.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.200
Then I do ask if she can hop down there right quick.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.240
A little help?

18:42.240 --> 18:47.440
A little help. Yeah, sorry Griffin, this is like, I don't, I don't like sitting across,

18:47.440 --> 18:52.000
I feel like there's too much room, especially with like some of these big tables. It's like

18:52.000 --> 18:55.440
really big and there's a crazy amount of distance and I don't like being that far from my wife.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.920
Like, I just like us to be close to each other so we can chat.

18:57.920 --> 19:02.880
Rachel and I only eat at intimate bistros because that's all that exists here in Austin.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.560
It's all intimate bistros.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.800
That could be, okay, so that could actually be, you may be kidding on the square here

19:08.800 --> 19:10.160
and, and I've hit upon something.

19:12.480 --> 19:16.480
All of the restaurants in Huntington have to be built to accommodate and

19:17.280 --> 19:21.200
whatever the table equivalent of an airplane seatbelt extender is,

19:21.760 --> 19:26.160
every table has to be fit to fit for that sort of

19:26.160 --> 19:28.480
human, human frame.

19:28.480 --> 19:28.880
Yeah.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.760
That sort of frame.

19:30.720 --> 19:36.560
And I think that that might be the problem is like, it's just so far in such a distance.

19:36.560 --> 19:36.800
Yeah.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.000
Plus they have to have all the room for all of the food.

19:40.640 --> 19:45.840
Another thing, like you brought up snuggling and that's just crazy to me because like

19:47.200 --> 19:54.000
Rachel nor I like to be touched when our mouth is, is full of quinoa.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.640
You know what I mean?

19:54.640 --> 19:59.200
Like when I'm, when I'm jaw full of quinoa.

19:59.200 --> 20:04.640
Well, no, I'm not talking about because my, my giant chompers might accidentally

20:04.640 --> 20:06.320
remove one of their digits.

20:06.320 --> 20:06.640
Okay.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.120
Just me.

20:07.120 --> 20:07.600
That's cool.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.840
Because I'm not a fucking Wolverine.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.080
Okay.

20:10.080 --> 20:10.560
That's fine.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.040
No, I mean like it's not, this is not touching time.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.040
Sometimes I, listen, I love my wife.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.960
I'm sure that you guys too do love your wives.

20:20.960 --> 20:24.640
Um, sometimes there are non-touching times.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.840
Sometimes there are times where you're not.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.240
But what about when you want to sensually feed each other?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.080
That's a great question.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.200
What about when you do want to sensually feed each other?

20:35.200 --> 20:37.520
Then do it across the table from each other.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.560
But then you risk like dropping the food on the table.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.640
Some people are okay with that.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.160
Some people are sensual.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.200
That's not erotic.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.400
That's a sloppy boy.

20:46.400 --> 20:52.160
Some people are okay with maybe once a month letting a piece of food not get eaten.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.760
Now here's the thing, Griffin.

20:53.760 --> 20:58.080
I, I hate to disagree with you, but anyone who's ever eaten with me knows that I leave

20:58.640 --> 21:01.440
quite the wake of debris around me when I am done.

21:01.440 --> 21:05.520
Travis, I hate to disagree with you, but you don't hate to disagree with anybody.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.160
That is correct.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.040
I love to disagree with you, but.

21:09.840 --> 21:10.160
Um.

21:10.160 --> 21:10.560
But.

21:10.560 --> 21:10.960
And.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.560
I would say.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.600
And here it comes.

21:13.600 --> 21:19.200
And so, as I was saying, I think that when, when you first start dating,

21:19.920 --> 21:24.000
you should always sit across the table because that's eye to eye contact,

21:24.720 --> 21:25.680
conversation.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.680
It's all keyed in the getting to know you process.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.120
I think once you reach a certain comfort level with each other,

21:31.920 --> 21:35.600
I actually usually kind of go the way of the seating.

21:36.160 --> 21:42.800
If, if the, if the, you know, host or pulls out the two chairs beside each other,

21:42.800 --> 21:43.840
I trust his judgment.

21:43.840 --> 21:44.880
I go with it.

21:44.880 --> 21:45.440
I am.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.000
You trust his take on your relationship.

21:48.000 --> 21:48.160
Yeah.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.600
If he's like, oh, this looks like a side-by-side catty corner kind of thing.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.160
I'm like, okay.

21:52.960 --> 21:53.360
Nailed it.

21:53.360 --> 21:57.680
But in a booth, in a booth, in a four-seater booth, you guys will fucking just use one bench.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.400
Oh God, no.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.440
Oh God, no.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.240
Oh God, no.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.280
No, no, no, no.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.440
No, I'm talking like a four top, you know.

22:03.440 --> 22:03.760
Okay.

22:03.760 --> 22:08.000
I was thinking about a booth and here I was thinking like my brothers are lunatics.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.680
No, same side, same side.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.800
No, same side of the booth.

22:10.800 --> 22:14.400
Oh see, I, I, I think you are wrong there because that looks like you're waiting for

22:14.400 --> 22:16.080
another person to turn into a ghost.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.600
Or that you're just lunatic.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.680
I would give that table a wide berth as I walked by to the bathroom for the third time.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.160
Absolutely.

22:22.160 --> 22:22.560
I'm sorry.

22:22.560 --> 22:23.680
I don't care how it looks.

22:23.680 --> 22:27.120
I love love and I love being with my wife and I'm not going to change for anybody.

22:27.120 --> 22:31.280
If you sit on the same side of the booth with your wife, you guys have to practice and coordinate

22:31.280 --> 22:36.000
that every time the server walks up, you guys turn your head in unison.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.720
At the same time.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.000
Yes.

22:38.000 --> 22:38.500
Yes.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.760
We need nothing else to part.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.600
We require more Sprite.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.680
Also, we cosplay the code heads everywhere we go.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.840
That's the other thing about it.

22:51.840 --> 22:56.960
I was thinking that you, like a meet Dave scenario where you guys have little people

22:56.960 --> 22:59.200
powering your human shaped starships.

22:59.200 --> 23:03.040
No, you know, like the classic meet Dave and everyone will understand the reference.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.120
Your Eddie Murphy starships are powered by Sprite.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.880
Like in the movie, Meet Dave, sponsored by Sprite.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.560
Did you see me, Dave, sponsored by Sprite?

23:10.560 --> 23:12.880
Did you see Pluto Nash also sponsored by Sprite?

23:13.760 --> 23:14.960
Do you know what would have been a better movie?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.880
He's been deep in the pocket of big Sprite.

23:16.880 --> 23:17.120
Yeah.

23:17.120 --> 23:21.040
Do you know what would have been a better movie than Meet M-E-E-T Dave?

23:21.040 --> 23:21.280
What?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.600
Meet M-E-A-T Dave.

23:23.600 --> 23:23.840
Yeah.

23:23.840 --> 23:24.560
What's the plot?

23:25.280 --> 23:26.400
Give me a synopsis.

23:26.400 --> 23:31.280
He's made of meat and he thinks other people are all controlled by robots.

23:31.280 --> 23:36.560
And he thinks that he's the only person that is actually flesh and bone.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.600
He's insane.

23:37.600 --> 23:37.840
Okay.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.160
And he's Tony Shalhoub and-

23:40.160 --> 23:42.320
And he's just cutting open people looking for their tiny-

23:42.320 --> 23:45.680
He's cutting open people looking for the robots inside.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.680
There's no Eddie Murphy in here.

23:48.400 --> 23:48.720
Right.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.200
He's looking for the little Eddie Murphy inside all of us.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.120
Well, aren't we all?

23:53.120 --> 23:56.400
And it turns out he's a serial killer and who should stop him but Batman.

23:57.120 --> 23:57.440
Okay.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.880
Played by Eddie Murphy.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.160
Meet Dave, Gotham Knights.

24:00.160 --> 24:00.720
Yes.

24:00.720 --> 24:01.760
I don't- listen.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.760
Eddie Murphy can't play more than one role in the same movie at the same time.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.520
What are you talking about?

24:07.520 --> 24:08.240
Madman.

24:08.960 --> 24:09.680
Madman.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.360
He's everybody in Mad Men.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.520
How about another Yahoo answer question?

24:14.240 --> 24:15.360
Yeah, hit me.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.160
I can't believe you sit on the same fucking side of a booth as your wife.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.400
I don't want to keep-

24:20.400 --> 24:24.240
She seems to like it, but this is probably one of those deathbed confessions I want to hear about.

24:26.240 --> 24:28.800
This Yahoo was sent in by Anna Schlumbom.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.280
Thank you, Anna.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.160
Davis B.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.160
0% best answers.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.280
Lot of shitheads.

24:39.120 --> 24:44.160
Davis B. asks, what are the top five best tuba brands?

24:46.160 --> 24:51.920
I have- I have no idea what the best tuba brands are except I know Yamaha is probably good.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.840
If Miraphone isn't in your top five, what do you think of it?

24:56.960 --> 24:58.160
You don't want a Miraphone.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.680
No.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.800
You don't want a Miraphone.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.120
You want to go with Blaster Phone.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.800
Blaster Phone is really good.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.520
It's a weird like sort of acoustic electric mix.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.240
And they cost $4 at a gas station.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.880
And it is a tuba shaped toy.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.920
But you'd be amazed.

25:15.920 --> 25:19.280
You'd be amazed at the kind of rich DBs you can get out of one of those bad boys.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.840
There's also a button that makes it sound like a dog barking.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.720
You don't get that on any of the other like upscale tubas.

25:24.720 --> 25:24.960
No.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.920
No, there's no dog barks in a Miraphone.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.440
Yamaha does if you let a dog bark into it.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.200
I like a nice inflatable tuba.

25:31.200 --> 25:31.680
Interesting.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.440
Not an especially rich sound.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.520
No, but I mean it's much easier to carry.

25:37.520 --> 25:37.760
Yeah.

25:39.760 --> 25:42.160
And it can save your life if you like fall out of a boat.

25:42.880 --> 25:49.200
Justin, did you- did you ever- I don't want to- I don't want to draw up any generalizations here.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.560
You weren't a tuba man, right?

25:50.560 --> 25:52.880
You were a coronet- a coronet fella.

25:52.880 --> 25:56.320
No, I was a euphonium or a baritone horn.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.920
And what's the difference between a baritone horn and a tuba?

25:59.920 --> 26:00.640
The one you made up?

26:01.360 --> 26:01.680
What?

26:01.680 --> 26:06.720
No, it's just- they're just other low brass instruments are basically the same.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.640
One's more for marching, one's more for concert.

26:09.760 --> 26:10.720
At least I think.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.000
I never paid that close attention.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.280
I didn't learn all the notes.

26:13.920 --> 26:14.800
But I learned maybe six or seven notes.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.080
And how long did you play?

26:16.800 --> 26:19.520
Blurt, blart, blurt, blart.

26:19.520 --> 26:24.000
It depends on how- whether it was a whole note or a half note, Trav.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.400
And then- can you give me a- can you give me a half note?

26:27.520 --> 26:28.020
Half.

26:28.640 --> 26:29.140
Okay.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.240
There's a one, two, three, four.

26:32.240 --> 26:32.740
Half.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.600
Here comes the whole note, you ready?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.240
Quarter note?

26:42.240 --> 26:44.640
Quar- quarter- quarter.

26:44.640 --> 26:45.200
What is it?

26:45.200 --> 26:45.700
Quarter.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.120
I got eight- I got eight notes coming, listen to this.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.040
Eight, eight, eight, eight, eight, eight, eight.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.240
What's that?

26:54.240 --> 26:55.200
Six teeth notes?

26:55.200 --> 26:57.520
No, it can't be done, it can't be done, it can't be done.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.680
Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.680
Oh no, you summoned- you summoned the devil.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.000
That is-

27:04.640 --> 27:06.240
And now you have to have a tuba battle with the devil.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.080
A tuba battle with the devil for your soul.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.220
The devil is-

27:09.220 --> 27:10.720
Blurt, blart, blurt, blurt, blurt, blurt, blurt.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.800
Justin went down to Georgia.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.720
It took him a long time because tubas are heavy.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.840
He was pretty tired by the time he got there.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.240
There, he took a little nap.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.080
Why didn't you guys go pro?

27:25.080 --> 27:27.000
Travis, you were a tromboner, right?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I was, a trombonist, please.

27:31.240 --> 27:34.540
The reason I did not go pro with my trombone skills

27:34.540 --> 27:36.540
is that there were three other trombonists

27:36.540 --> 27:39.200
in my middle school band,

27:39.200 --> 27:42.000
and what we did was each of us learned

27:42.000 --> 27:45.020
one fourth of the song,

27:45.020 --> 27:47.320
and then that person would play their part

27:47.320 --> 27:51.080
while the other three just moved the slides up and down

27:51.080 --> 27:52.960
until your part came around,

27:52.960 --> 27:55.640
and then you'd pick it up and the other three would drop out.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.160
Was there not like a clear,

27:57.160 --> 28:00.240
like you're playing, you can call me Al,

28:00.240 --> 28:01.080
and during halftime it's like-

28:01.080 --> 28:02.880
No, because then you just put your mouth

28:02.880 --> 28:04.160
to the mouthpiece and go,

28:04.160 --> 28:05.760
boo-doo-doo-doo, boo-doo-doo-doo.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.560
No, no, but I'm saying there would be like a clear,

28:07.560 --> 28:09.600
like one of you is clearly better than the other,

28:09.600 --> 28:10.440
so it'd be like,

28:10.440 --> 28:15.440
ah, ah, ah, ah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

28:15.440 --> 28:18.000
Chris Cumming was just amazing.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.280
He was the trombone to stop.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.760
Yeah.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.720
And so we had to have a talk.

28:23.720 --> 28:26.440
I think every trombonist is the trombonist to stop.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.400
We had to have a little talk with Chris.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.640
He was making us all look bad.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.320
He said, hey, cool it out, hotshot.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.520
I never did band.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.360
That's weird, Griffin,

28:36.360 --> 28:37.600
because you're probably the most musically inclined

28:37.600 --> 28:38.440
of the three of us.

28:38.440 --> 28:42.500
I mean, I used the instrument of my diaphragm.

28:42.500 --> 28:47.040
My vaginal birth control device.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.960
And he never got pregnant, so I was like.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.640
No, you know, I wanted to,

28:52.640 --> 28:55.440
but I didn't know where to even fucking start.

28:55.440 --> 28:59.360
What I wanted to know was when somebody decides to do band

28:59.360 --> 29:02.320
and they also decide that they don't want to do it,

29:02.320 --> 29:03.840
but that they have to do it,

29:03.840 --> 29:08.840
then do you try as hard as you can to get the piccolo?

29:13.460 --> 29:16.380
Cause that seems like the fucking jam.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.100
Just like carry around these two double A batteries.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.080
All right, yeah, I can do that.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.540
This is the crazy thing to me.

29:22.540 --> 29:25.940
I remember very clearly the first day of middle school band

29:25.940 --> 29:27.220
and the teacher said, okay,

29:27.220 --> 29:28.980
what instrument does everyone want to play?

29:28.980 --> 29:31.820
And 50% of the class wanted to play drums.

29:31.820 --> 29:35.180
And 50% of the class wanted to play saxophone.

29:35.180 --> 29:36.020
And that was it.

29:36.020 --> 29:37.900
Well, that was during the Clinton, that was the Clinton.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.420
She was like, okay, listen,

29:39.420 --> 29:41.500
somebody's got to do trumpet.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.380
Somebody's got to do trombone.

29:44.380 --> 29:46.900
All of us really enjoyed the new musical phenomena

29:46.900 --> 29:48.660
that is Dave Matthews band.

29:48.660 --> 29:49.500
We did it.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.140
But some of you, first off, we don't have any violins.

29:52.140 --> 29:54.060
So you guys need to leave.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.740
Cause neither of you ended up with what I would consider

29:56.740 --> 29:59.780
to be a light instrument that I, and I don't hope,

29:59.780 --> 30:01.560
I really hope I don't offend you.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.020
A couple of lazy fucks can just like carry around

30:04.020 --> 30:04.920
in the hot sun.

30:04.920 --> 30:05.760
Here's what happened.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.340
I did use my trombone for self-defense once.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.180
Oh, I remember that.

30:09.180 --> 30:10.820
It's the only fight you ever won.

30:10.820 --> 30:11.660
That's good.

30:11.660 --> 30:12.700
Here's the thing I wanted to tell you

30:12.700 --> 30:14.820
about everything that you don't know from band.

30:14.820 --> 30:16.980
Here's how I remember it.

30:16.980 --> 30:19.460
I started learning to play trumpet.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.220
That's how I got my start.

30:21.220 --> 30:26.220
But my lips were too big to play trumpet well.

30:27.540 --> 30:29.400
Oh, I see. It hurt me.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.240
Yeah.

30:30.240 --> 30:33.660
Which makes me think that maybe they don't assign,

30:33.660 --> 30:34.540
maybe they just let you pick

30:34.540 --> 30:37.440
because any self-respecting music teacher

30:37.440 --> 30:41.020
would take a look at these luscious, luscious.

30:41.020 --> 30:43.060
That you got from your nanny, clearly.

30:43.060 --> 30:45.860
These luscious kiss machines and said like,

30:45.860 --> 30:46.700
I don't know.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.280
I think this is a baritone or euphonium man

30:50.280 --> 30:51.460
and not a trumpet man.

30:51.460 --> 30:55.500
So I flushed the, I wasted the best year of my life

30:55.500 --> 30:57.780
trying to learn how to play trumpet.

30:57.780 --> 30:59.700
Justin, I don't know when the best year

30:59.700 --> 31:00.860
of your life is,

31:00.860 --> 31:03.420
but it definitely fucking didn't happen

31:03.420 --> 31:04.900
at Comac Middle School.

31:04.900 --> 31:08.340
I just know they closed Comac.

31:08.340 --> 31:11.900
You know that both Comac and Miller Elementary are no more.

31:11.900 --> 31:15.020
Miller was turned to dust and Comac they,

31:15.020 --> 31:16.440
we outlived, basically what I'm saying

31:16.440 --> 31:17.700
is we outlived both of them.

31:17.700 --> 31:18.540
Good.

31:18.540 --> 31:19.360
So hooray for us.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.200
Yeah.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.420
Oh man, I'm gonna miss those blue streaks.

31:21.420 --> 31:23.260
What even the fuck is a blue streak?

31:23.260 --> 31:24.220
Get a better mascot.

31:24.220 --> 31:25.380
Oh wait, you can't.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.940
You can't, you're dead.

31:26.940 --> 31:27.880
You're dead.

31:27.880 --> 31:28.720
We beat you.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.820
We beat you middle school.

31:29.820 --> 31:31.820
You're the fucking shittiest three years ever

31:31.820 --> 31:33.060
anyone has to go through.

31:33.060 --> 31:34.240
If you're listening to this podcast

31:34.240 --> 31:35.080
in your middle school,

31:35.080 --> 31:36.560
first of all, that's awesome.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.580
Second of all, keep on.

31:38.580 --> 31:39.720
Just keep pushing.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.320
It's the worst.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.660
It's the absolute pits.

31:42.660 --> 31:45.060
My little sister-in-law Riley graduated

31:45.060 --> 31:46.520
and I looked at her and I was like,

31:46.520 --> 31:47.360
I just want you to know

31:47.360 --> 31:48.900
that you've finished the hardest thing you'll ever do.

31:48.900 --> 31:49.740
Yeah.

31:49.740 --> 31:50.560
There's nothing.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.720
There's literally nothing.

31:51.720 --> 31:52.740
There's literally nothing.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.980
Trust me, I've gone out pretty far out ahead of you.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.780
There is no point in your life

31:57.780 --> 31:59.740
at which you go,

31:59.740 --> 32:02.420
I am both dealing with as much shit

32:02.420 --> 32:04.020
as I did in middle school

32:04.020 --> 32:07.660
and also can't like, I don't know, drink or smoke

32:07.660 --> 32:10.460
or drive a car or a boat.

32:10.460 --> 32:14.220
And I'm slowly jizzing a little bit 24-7

32:14.220 --> 32:16.260
and I don't understand why.

32:16.260 --> 32:34.340
Listen, we start Money Zone with a danger box.

32:34.340 --> 32:36.260
Every time I talk about how hungry you are,

32:36.260 --> 32:37.860
how about you order some snacks

32:37.860 --> 32:40.140
before you get fucking hungry?

32:40.140 --> 32:41.640
I order them now.

32:41.640 --> 32:42.480
I did.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.680
I asked them to re-up my snack subscription this week,

32:45.680 --> 32:47.380
but they haven't come in yet.

32:47.380 --> 32:50.780
Nature box is, it's like, okay.

32:50.780 --> 32:52.060
So you get hungry, right?

32:52.060 --> 32:53.460
That happens to everybody sometimes.

32:53.460 --> 32:54.560
Not me.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.400
Okay.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.500
And you want a snack.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.540
So you go to the vending machine.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.200
Oh my God, it's all chemicals and butter.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.460
That's the only thing in that machine.

33:02.460 --> 33:05.480
And a high fructose corn syrup is garbage.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.320
Nature box is like that.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.160
It's like a vending machine

33:09.160 --> 33:11.660
in a cardboard box in your house.

33:11.660 --> 33:12.620
That it doesn't-

33:12.620 --> 33:13.460
But it doesn't have butter and chemicals.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.820
It doesn't put money into it, it doesn't vent stuff in.

33:15.820 --> 33:18.340
You just open the box and then you open the package

33:18.340 --> 33:19.180
and then you eat it.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.780
Oh, so kind of like a box.

33:20.780 --> 33:22.620
Yeah, kind of like a box.

33:22.620 --> 33:23.860
The more we live with this metaphor,

33:23.860 --> 33:26.300
I feel like the shine's nearly off the apple,

33:26.300 --> 33:27.140
but it doesn't have our official stuff.

33:27.140 --> 33:29.340
And sometimes when you're trying to eat the pralines,

33:29.340 --> 33:31.300
it gets stuck in the box and you have to shake the box.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.140
Get out of there.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.620
Oh, wait, it's a box.

33:33.620 --> 33:34.720
I can just open it.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.220
The nature box lets you pick the snacks you want.

33:39.220 --> 33:42.100
You log onto their website, naturebox.com,

33:42.100 --> 33:45.340
and you're gonna be able to pick the South Pacific,

33:45.340 --> 33:46.980
plantain chips and everything, bagel sticks,

33:46.980 --> 33:51.480
and the BBQ kettle kernels, the vanilla almond clusters,

33:51.480 --> 33:53.900
French toast granola, that's what I like.

33:54.740 --> 33:57.980
And you can, it's like a subscription thing.

33:57.980 --> 33:59.460
You tell them what snacks you want

33:59.460 --> 34:00.300
and they'll send them to you.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.340
They're delicious.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.620
Ooh, ooh, they're good.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.340
I'm getting hungry right now just thinking about them.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.340
And when they send them to you,

34:05.340 --> 34:08.180
it's free shipping anywhere in the U.S., so.

34:08.180 --> 34:11.300
Ooh, does that include the non-contiguous states?

34:11.300 --> 34:12.260
I must assume so.

34:12.260 --> 34:14.460
Does that include the secret states?

34:14.460 --> 34:16.180
It does. Better than all of this

34:16.180 --> 34:18.220
is that we can get you 50% off your first box.

34:18.220 --> 34:21.780
You go to naturebox.com slash my brother

34:21.780 --> 34:26.780
and you're gonna get fit and healthy and 50% off.

34:27.380 --> 34:29.180
So it's a steal.

34:29.180 --> 34:30.520
Don't wait.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.580
Stay full, stay strong.

34:32.580 --> 34:33.520
Get fed.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.200
Do you think I just scared the shit

34:35.200 --> 34:37.660
out of all of our listeners in the secret states?

34:37.660 --> 34:38.860
They're like, oh no, he knows.

34:38.860 --> 34:39.700
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

34:39.700 --> 34:43.340
Tell all of my friends in upper Montana.

34:43.340 --> 34:46.500
It's a secret state on top of Montana.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.040
You didn't think anything was up there.

34:48.040 --> 34:52.220
Beyond the fog, beyond the wall, beyond the fog wall.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.060
What is that?

34:53.060 --> 34:55.320
It's a secret state called upper Montana.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.500
Our next live show is in upper Montana, by the way.

34:58.500 --> 34:59.340
It's great.

34:59.340 --> 35:01.980
We're in the badlands of upper Montana.

35:01.980 --> 35:03.940
Inside the spiral cave.

35:03.940 --> 35:08.940
All our attendees are gonna be goblins.

35:11.340 --> 35:13.720
And we will be stoned as shit.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.140
We had to bring our roto cycle

35:16.140 --> 35:20.180
and we'll trade bottle caps for more water rations.

35:20.180 --> 35:22.180
And it's gonna be a great show.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.380
It's gonna be a really great show.

35:23.380 --> 35:24.540
We'll all probably die.

35:25.420 --> 35:28.200
Guys, you've tried Hulu on your computer.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.100
I know that you have.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.580
You're probably doing it right now as we record.

35:30.580 --> 35:34.020
You're probably watching, I don't know, Survivor

35:34.020 --> 35:34.860
or something.

35:34.860 --> 35:36.900
Let me tell you about Hulu Plus though.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.460
Cause it's a lot better.

35:38.460 --> 35:40.520
With Hulu Plus, you can watch current season episodes

35:40.520 --> 35:43.240
of your favorite shows like Family Guy, Parks and Rec,

35:43.240 --> 35:45.360
Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.900
You can watch every episode of shows like Community

35:47.900 --> 35:51.580
and South Park, but there's a lot more to it than that,

35:51.580 --> 35:53.220
isn't there?

35:53.220 --> 35:54.580
Yes.

35:54.580 --> 35:55.400
Great, is there?

35:55.400 --> 35:56.460
I'm glad we had this talk.

35:56.460 --> 35:59.960
You can also, aside from just like your mobile device

35:59.960 --> 36:03.160
or tablet or whatnot, you can also watch it on computer,

36:03.160 --> 36:06.440
smart TV, Roku, Apple TV, Xbox, PlayStation,

36:06.440 --> 36:09.600
pretty much like anything you have that you could stream

36:09.600 --> 36:12.420
shit to, you can watch Hulu Plus on.

36:13.300 --> 36:14.280
Can you imagine?

36:14.280 --> 36:18.080
They have archived shows, like every episode

36:18.080 --> 36:21.100
of older television programming.

36:21.100 --> 36:23.240
It's not on the air anymore.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.460
They have original programming like Deadbeat,

36:25.460 --> 36:28.660
a comedy about a pot smoking guy that talks to ghosts.

36:28.660 --> 36:30.940
Don't all pot smoking guys talk to ghosts, though?

36:30.940 --> 36:33.500
They do, and if you think about how much you pay a month

36:33.500 --> 36:34.500
for cable.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.660
$800.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.500
Yeah, and if you're not paying for like some kind

36:37.500 --> 36:40.280
of DVR service, they come on and they're gone.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.980
That's a wasted resource.

36:41.980 --> 36:43.860
You're paying for shows that you don't get a chance

36:43.860 --> 36:44.700
to watch.

36:44.700 --> 36:48.940
With Hulu, it's just $7.99 a month, and it's always there.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.020
So if you say, oh, I don't have time to watch the new episode

36:52.020 --> 36:54.500
of Parks and Recreation, it's cool.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.560
It'll still be there two hours later.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.660
You didn't miss it.

36:57.660 --> 37:00.580
From two hours later to up until the heat death

37:00.580 --> 37:01.700
of the universe.

37:01.700 --> 37:02.540
Yeah.

37:02.540 --> 37:05.100
That's how long your episode's gonna last on Hulu Plus.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.740
What if I don't wanna pay for it right now?

37:09.740 --> 37:10.580
What's your fucking problem?

37:10.580 --> 37:12.020
These guys are giving us money to talk about

37:12.020 --> 37:13.020
how great their product is.

37:13.020 --> 37:16.140
You could say like, I wanna pay for this right now.

37:16.140 --> 37:17.940
Nothing's gonna stop me from paying for this.

37:17.940 --> 37:19.140
Take my money.

37:19.140 --> 37:20.700
But we are gonna stop you,

37:20.700 --> 37:23.060
because you're gonna Hulu Plus comp slash my brother.

37:23.060 --> 37:25.180
Whoa, wanna try that again there, speed demon?

37:25.180 --> 37:26.020
Whoa!

37:26.020 --> 37:27.620
Whoa!

37:27.620 --> 37:30.900
Did you just have a typo in your mouth?

37:30.900 --> 37:33.980
Did you just have a vocal typo?

37:33.980 --> 37:37.860
Hulu Plus dot com slash my brother.

37:37.860 --> 37:40.460
You know it's a good mental typo

37:40.460 --> 37:43.700
when you are trying to correct it as you say it.

37:43.700 --> 37:47.780
Dot com slash my bro for, oh shit.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.780
Sorry, I got off the home row.

37:49.780 --> 37:52.700
Hulu Plus dot com slash my brother,

37:52.700 --> 37:55.180
and you get two weeks for free.

37:55.180 --> 37:56.860
Go there right now.

37:56.860 --> 37:57.700
I'm tired of dealing with you.

37:57.700 --> 38:00.140
One more quick thing I want everybody to do.

38:00.140 --> 38:03.620
Go to WednesdayWolf.com and make the world stranger.

38:05.020 --> 38:06.620
Oh my shit, this stuff is awesome.

38:06.620 --> 38:10.100
Yeah, what are we talking about here, paintings?

38:10.100 --> 38:13.020
Yeah, it's paintings, drawings, it's kind of,

38:13.020 --> 38:13.860
it reminds me a lot,

38:13.860 --> 38:16.940
have you ever read the book The Hungry Caterpillar?

38:16.940 --> 38:18.780
If you took those little illustrations

38:18.780 --> 38:20.980
and ran them through like an LSD filter.

38:20.980 --> 38:24.660
Yeah, a lot of these paintings are painted with,

38:24.660 --> 38:29.140
and this is a quote, watercolor, ink, so far so good,

38:29.140 --> 38:33.180
and various bodily fluids, not yet convicted of murder

38:33.180 --> 38:34.420
is what this person says.

38:34.420 --> 38:36.020
Great, great, great.

38:36.020 --> 38:38.420
Our friends RushFreshTick and Chris Plant

38:38.420 --> 38:40.020
have a video series called The Cooperatives

38:40.020 --> 38:42.820
and they were actually turned into a piece of art.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.660
That hasn't come down from my brother and me yet,

38:44.660 --> 38:46.200
but I'm holding that hope.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.500
There's some really great,

38:47.500 --> 38:49.460
genuinely terrifying stuff in here.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.380
A lot of Pokemon, which I appreciate.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.340
I might buy one of them,

38:52.340 --> 38:55.700
but I don't wanna accidentally touch someone else's jizz.

38:56.660 --> 39:00.220
Do we get a no jizz guarantee on some of these paintings?

39:00.220 --> 39:03.140
Wednesdaywolf.com and make the world stranger.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.580
Go, go, you gotta look.

39:04.580 --> 39:05.420
Be free. Just go look.

39:05.420 --> 39:06.660
Just go look at it.

39:06.660 --> 39:09.660
I got a message for Zach Doring.

39:09.660 --> 39:11.820
That's a guess on that pronunciation.

39:11.820 --> 39:13.620
It's from Feliza Doring.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.260
I bet I didn't get either of those right,

39:15.260 --> 39:16.220
and I'm just trying.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.180
You got one out of four so far.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.980
Okay, Zatch.

39:19.980 --> 39:22.940
I am so proud of everything you've done

39:22.940 --> 39:24.580
in the last couple of years.

39:24.580 --> 39:26.620
I love you so much.

39:26.620 --> 39:29.140
Congrats on 10 years of service

39:29.140 --> 39:31.580
and welcome to civilian life.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.780
Love, KK.

39:33.780 --> 39:37.820
P.S., deployment emails have been taken to a new level.

39:38.660 --> 39:39.500
So that's-

39:39.500 --> 39:40.340
I don't know what that means,

39:40.340 --> 39:41.780
but it sounds intense.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.820
Zach, thank you so much for your service.

39:43.820 --> 39:45.700
It is not specifically outlined

39:45.700 --> 39:46.860
if you were in the military

39:46.860 --> 39:50.860
or maybe some sort of underground secret spy crime ring.

39:50.860 --> 39:53.180
He was in the upper Montana police.

39:53.180 --> 39:55.140
In the upper Montana mounted police.

39:55.140 --> 39:57.820
He was a barbarian in the upper Montana police force.

39:57.820 --> 40:01.420
He was a potion alchemist.

40:01.420 --> 40:04.220
Thank you for your help up there.

40:04.220 --> 40:05.220
You know, the potion alchemist,

40:05.220 --> 40:07.340
they don't see a lot of like field time,

40:07.340 --> 40:08.500
but it's just as dangerous

40:08.500 --> 40:11.100
because they're trying new spells every day,

40:11.100 --> 40:12.540
and those shapes can blow up in your face.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.180
People think the Bolt Rangers have it easy.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.020
No.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.980
And you think that they just like,

40:17.980 --> 40:19.420
the goblins see the fog wall

40:19.420 --> 40:20.620
and they're like, we'll stay back.

40:20.620 --> 40:22.780
No, they'll step to it.

40:22.780 --> 40:25.460
And fucking Zach, King beyond the fog wall,

40:25.460 --> 40:28.020
stays there and keeps us all safe for 10 years.

40:28.020 --> 40:28.860
So really it's like,

40:28.860 --> 40:30.980
thank God for the upper Montana mounted police

40:30.980 --> 40:32.780
because they're doing it so you don't have to.

40:32.780 --> 40:33.780
Right.

40:33.780 --> 40:35.180
Yeah, yeah.

40:35.180 --> 40:36.700
They're mounted on chocobos.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.340
I want to go to this place we've created.

40:38.340 --> 40:39.900
I know!

40:39.900 --> 40:40.740
Now I'm sold.

40:40.740 --> 40:43.140
Now I know how Tolkien feels.

40:43.140 --> 40:48.140
What's up?

40:50.180 --> 40:52.140
My name is Jasper Redd,

40:52.140 --> 40:54.140
co-host of the Goose Down,

40:54.140 --> 40:56.580
along with the lovely Kimberly Clark.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.700
And we want to invite you into the comfort and groove

40:59.700 --> 41:04.060
of our podcast that encompasses the arts and entertainment.

41:04.060 --> 41:07.060
You can check us out at maximalfund.org,

41:07.060 --> 41:09.340
also available on iTunes.

41:09.340 --> 41:10.180
See ya.

41:10.180 --> 41:11.020
See ya.

41:12.860 --> 41:15.380
So I have been in my school's,

41:15.380 --> 41:16.900
there are program.

41:16.900 --> 41:17.740
Theater?

41:18.700 --> 41:19.540
Yes.

41:19.540 --> 41:20.380
I'm sorry.

41:20.380 --> 41:21.700
That was a bad pace for me.

41:21.700 --> 41:22.900
Why are you so bad?

41:22.900 --> 41:26.780
How did you break up a word midway through in a pace?

41:26.780 --> 41:30.040
So I have been in my school's theater program

41:30.040 --> 41:31.900
for two years now,

41:31.900 --> 41:34.720
and I've yet to click with my drama teacher.

41:34.720 --> 41:37.020
He's the kind of guy who picks favorites from his students

41:37.020 --> 41:39.060
and I am not one of them.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.340
His favorite students are always the one

41:40.340 --> 41:41.980
he recommends to people

41:41.980 --> 41:44.020
and gives the best roles on auditions.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.820
I'm not a bad actor,

41:45.820 --> 41:47.340
but he never really notices me

41:47.340 --> 41:49.980
or acknowledges that I'm just as good as them.

41:49.980 --> 41:51.420
Do you have any advice for me

41:51.420 --> 41:53.060
about how to make him notice me

41:53.060 --> 41:54.700
or make him like me more?

41:54.700 --> 41:57.320
That's from unnoticed actress.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.220
I have good news for you.

42:00.220 --> 42:02.560
He is giving you the greatest gift.

42:03.580 --> 42:07.560
He is giving you the drive and desire to become famous

42:07.560 --> 42:09.980
and shove it back in his stupid face.

42:09.980 --> 42:13.460
And also he's preparing you for a career

42:13.460 --> 42:14.980
of what is going to,

42:14.980 --> 42:16.560
and I'm sure you're gonna make it.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.300
Listen, a lot of people come to us

42:18.300 --> 42:21.380
and they say, I got big old stars in my eyes, ow!

42:21.380 --> 42:25.200
And then we say, yeah.

42:25.200 --> 42:28.340
But for you, I know that you're gonna make it.

42:28.340 --> 42:32.540
You are going to face a lot of neglect.

42:33.860 --> 42:34.820
A lot of neglect.

42:34.820 --> 42:35.900
A lot of neglect.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.620
You think you've tasted neglect?

42:37.620 --> 42:40.160
You don't know fucking anything.

42:40.160 --> 42:43.900
It's gonna get so much worse before it gets better.

42:43.900 --> 42:44.820
It'll get better.

42:44.820 --> 42:45.820
And you're gonna make it.

42:45.820 --> 42:48.020
Ooh, someday I'm gonna see your name in lights,

42:48.020 --> 42:50.420
but before I'm gonna see your name in shit.

42:50.420 --> 42:53.860
You are on the perfect arc for superstardom.

42:53.860 --> 42:57.340
Think about every actor or actress you've ever heard from.

42:57.340 --> 42:59.320
How many of their stories start with,

42:59.320 --> 43:02.220
well, from a young age, I was coddled

43:02.220 --> 43:05.520
and I was coddled by everybody.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.740
And I had a super healthy upbringing

43:07.740 --> 43:09.660
and everybody was really nice to me

43:09.660 --> 43:11.100
and that's why I'm famous today.

43:11.100 --> 43:15.060
No, you have to start with nobody acknowledging

43:15.060 --> 43:17.260
your existence until you make it.

43:17.260 --> 43:18.860
Do you think that's 100% true?

43:18.860 --> 43:22.620
Do you think like, I think maybe Keira Knightley

43:22.620 --> 43:25.200
was like, from the womb, like,

43:25.200 --> 43:27.020
let's get the, oh, we gotta get this kid famous.

43:27.020 --> 43:27.860
She was genetically developed.

43:27.860 --> 43:29.420
We gotta get the kid famous as fast as possible.

43:29.420 --> 43:32.580
Get her, get on the movie, quick, go, go, go, go.

43:32.580 --> 43:33.420
Look at her face.

43:33.420 --> 43:34.240
Throw the camera.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.080
Is there anything in the camera?

43:35.080 --> 43:36.740
Give me a camera.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.780
I'll write the script as we go.

43:38.780 --> 43:41.040
Look at that face.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.840
Listen, if you want a Rambo, right?

43:43.840 --> 43:46.220
You gotta raise a Rambo, right?

43:46.220 --> 43:48.140
You don't coddle them.

43:48.140 --> 43:49.100
You gotta raise a Rambo.

43:49.100 --> 43:50.700
There's two kinds of actors in this world.

43:50.700 --> 43:51.540
There's actors-

43:51.540 --> 43:54.020
There's Keira Knightley and Rambos.

43:54.020 --> 43:55.880
There's Keira Knightley and there's Rambos, right?

43:55.880 --> 43:57.440
You're either a Knightley or a Rambo.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.920
You're either so coddled that you take it for granted

43:59.920 --> 44:01.000
that everything's gonna come to you.

44:01.000 --> 44:01.840
You don't work hard.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.640
You're not out there pounding the pavement,

44:03.640 --> 44:07.120
6 a.m. cattle call auditions until you make it big.

44:07.120 --> 44:07.960
You hit that thing.

44:07.960 --> 44:10.100
Director goes, that person, they've got the look.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.720
I want them in my movie, right?

44:11.720 --> 44:14.080
And if you're coddled, yeah, yeah,

44:14.080 --> 44:15.480
maybe you're a Keira Knightley,

44:15.480 --> 44:18.160
but that's literally one in billions.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.740
Well, I would say for everybody,

44:20.740 --> 44:22.680
that's definitely one in billions.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.040
I wanna teach you a valuable lesson, unnoticed actress.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.600
I am sorry that you're acting teachers

44:26.600 --> 44:27.560
and not giving you the attention

44:27.560 --> 44:28.640
that you so richly deserve.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.920
You have great hits and podcasts,

44:30.920 --> 44:35.160
but you are given an invaluable opportunity right now

44:35.160 --> 44:39.000
to realize that when you are doing this as a profession,

44:39.000 --> 44:40.120
and it's gonna be a lot of times

44:40.120 --> 44:41.880
when you don't get the attention you deserve,

44:41.880 --> 44:45.160
and it's a great opportunity for you to focus on the work.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.800
I don't know what the work is,

44:46.800 --> 44:49.000
but I've heard a lot of people talk about it.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.320
It seems like something you should be focused on.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.280
You try to cry in front of a mirror,

44:54.280 --> 44:57.380
and you do that for just hours at a time.

44:57.380 --> 44:58.220
Just, ah!

44:58.220 --> 44:59.580
Ah!

44:59.580 --> 45:02.500
Yeah, and you gotta put yourself in the head of people.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.260
You know, like what would it be like

45:04.260 --> 45:06.180
to be a guy who didn't like Syria?

45:06.180 --> 45:08.500
Yeah, I'm Matthew McConaughey.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.900
All right, okay.

45:09.900 --> 45:11.620
Okay, okay.

45:11.620 --> 45:12.440
Nailed it.

45:12.440 --> 45:13.340
So that was me, that's me,

45:13.340 --> 45:15.160
and what you just heard was the work,

45:15.160 --> 45:18.020
and I just became a little bit of a better actor.

45:18.020 --> 45:18.860
Just like that.

45:18.860 --> 45:20.060
Give me another one.

45:20.060 --> 45:21.940
I'm the president, Barack Obama.

45:21.940 --> 45:25.220
Hi, let me sign that bill.

45:25.220 --> 45:26.040
Let me sign that bill.

45:26.040 --> 45:28.140
Ooh, I don't know about drones.

45:28.140 --> 45:32.140
So then that was more, now I could probably do him.

45:32.140 --> 45:33.780
Now can you do Bronco-Bama?

45:33.780 --> 45:35.500
Yeah, I'm Bronco-Bama.

45:35.500 --> 45:38.500
Let me hide, let me, ooh, look out for that rattler.

45:38.500 --> 45:40.340
Hand me that bill to sign into law.

45:41.500 --> 45:44.300
He's our Wild West president.

45:44.300 --> 45:46.540
So now that's, I'm a little bit better.

45:46.540 --> 45:47.700
I'm gonna go audition, actually.

45:47.700 --> 45:49.260
I'm gonna stop the podcast right here

45:49.260 --> 45:50.460
and go audition just as.

45:50.460 --> 45:51.300
All right, quick edit.

45:51.300 --> 45:53.640
Quick edit, let me just run out.

45:53.640 --> 45:54.480
I got it.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.640
What role?

45:56.640 --> 45:58.260
Bronco-Bama.

45:58.260 --> 46:01.780
The role of Bronco-Bama in a local auto dealership

46:01.780 --> 46:03.300
commercial, I'm assuming?

46:03.300 --> 46:06.820
Bronco-Bama, and it's in City Slickers 3.

46:06.820 --> 46:07.920
Shitty Slickers.

46:09.860 --> 46:10.860
It's called Shitty Slickers,

46:10.860 --> 46:12.740
because they just, like, they know.

46:12.740 --> 46:13.580
Yeah.

46:13.580 --> 46:14.780
They know.

46:14.780 --> 46:16.080
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

46:17.700 --> 46:20.060
I want to see Shitty Slickers.

46:20.060 --> 46:21.540
Yeah, now I really want to watch that.

46:21.540 --> 46:24.420
Okay, so now I need to go to Upper Montana,

46:24.420 --> 46:25.700
and I need to see Shitty Slickers,

46:25.700 --> 46:26.820
and neither will ever happen,

46:26.820 --> 46:29.340
because our ideas are too beautiful to exist.

46:29.340 --> 46:31.500
Too often, people take movie titles,

46:31.500 --> 46:34.020
and then they convert them into, like, porn movie titles.

46:34.020 --> 46:35.140
I wish that more people would say,

46:35.140 --> 46:37.860
but what if I just made a really bad version of this movie?

46:37.860 --> 46:38.700
Yeah.

46:38.700 --> 46:39.520
I'd call it Shitty Slickers.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.360
Yeah, pretty good.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.240
I mean, it's not a bad, it's not a remake.

46:42.240 --> 46:45.980
Original script, written by that fucking dude

46:45.980 --> 46:48.500
who writes all the X movies that are so bad.

46:48.500 --> 46:51.520
If I wrote a show about four women

46:51.520 --> 46:53.600
leading really boring, stupid lives,

46:53.600 --> 46:55.220
I think I'd call it Sex and the Shitty.

46:55.220 --> 46:56.060
Shh.

46:56.060 --> 46:56.900
Shh.

46:56.900 --> 46:57.740
Shh.

46:57.740 --> 46:58.580
How about a Yahoo?

46:59.580 --> 47:00.420
Yeah, please.

47:00.420 --> 47:01.240
This Yahoo was sent in by Jackie.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.080
Thank you, Jackie.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.880
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

47:04.980 --> 47:07.300
Is it too late to do Caroline and the Shitty?

47:07.300 --> 47:08.140
Yeah, it's way too late.

47:08.140 --> 47:08.960
Okay, fine.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.500
Yeah, you're just doing City now.

47:10.500 --> 47:13.260
I know, I've tapped this well.

47:13.260 --> 47:17.460
This user's been deleted, been suspended from the Matrix.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.300
Not like this.

47:18.300 --> 47:19.120
Send Shitty.

47:19.120 --> 47:19.960
Great.

47:20.940 --> 47:24.220
This anonymous deleted user.

47:24.220 --> 47:25.980
Do we, are we just gonna sit here

47:25.980 --> 47:28.340
and think of other movies that have City in the title?

47:28.340 --> 47:29.660
Yes.

47:29.660 --> 47:30.500
Babe Pig in the Shitty.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.920
I was just about to do Babe Pig in the Shippy.

47:34.020 --> 47:34.860
Excuse me.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.220
All right.

47:37.220 --> 47:38.060
Okay.

47:38.060 --> 47:39.100
Can we move on?

47:39.100 --> 47:40.820
Yes, I have one other thing to say.

47:40.820 --> 47:42.660
Sex and the Shitty 2.

47:43.780 --> 47:45.100
The Legend of Curly's Gold.

47:45.100 --> 47:45.940
All right.

47:45.940 --> 47:46.760
Shitty of Angels.

47:46.760 --> 47:47.600
Great.

47:50.660 --> 47:51.500
Okay.

47:51.500 --> 47:52.320
I'm trying to think.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.160
Okay.

47:53.160 --> 47:54.000
Can I do one?

47:54.000 --> 47:54.840
Yes.

47:54.840 --> 47:55.660
I need to think.

47:55.660 --> 47:56.500
Wasn't there a,

47:56.500 --> 47:58.340
what was the movie about the mouse

47:58.340 --> 48:00.940
that Michael J. Fox had a voice for?

48:00.940 --> 48:02.640
Stuart Little?

48:02.640 --> 48:03.480
Stuart Shittle?

48:05.620 --> 48:07.420
It doesn't have City in it at all.

48:07.420 --> 48:09.380
It's nothing, it has nothing to do with City

48:09.380 --> 48:11.700
and I thought you were gonna say New Jack Shitty.

48:11.700 --> 48:13.080
Oh, that's New Jack Shitty.

48:13.080 --> 48:13.920
All right.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.740
Okay.

48:14.740 --> 48:15.700
So this deleted user asks.

48:15.700 --> 48:16.520
Yes.

48:16.520 --> 48:20.860
Is there a way to incorporate a third nipple into sex?

48:20.860 --> 48:24.500
I have a third superfluous nipple below my left breast.

48:24.500 --> 48:26.540
Although sensation is diminished

48:26.540 --> 48:28.100
compared to my other nipple.

48:28.100 --> 48:29.740
I almost said regular nipples,

48:29.740 --> 48:31.020
but that's hateful, I suppose.

48:31.020 --> 48:32.300
That's offensive.

48:32.300 --> 48:33.140
My typical nipples.

48:33.140 --> 48:35.500
My tip, my tipicles.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.540
I still have enough sensation

48:37.540 --> 48:41.140
to enjoy it being touched by a woman during sex.

48:41.140 --> 48:43.700
However, during sexual encounters,

48:43.700 --> 48:45.380
who calls them that?

48:45.380 --> 48:47.820
Most of the girls I've known have been turned off

48:47.820 --> 48:49.420
or even slightly frightened by it.

48:49.420 --> 48:51.380
Oh, no.

48:51.380 --> 48:53.900
Is it really that bizarre to want stimulation

48:53.900 --> 48:56.600
in this third extra erogenous zone?

48:56.600 --> 48:58.060
Or should I feel guilty

48:58.060 --> 49:01.140
and regard this as a birth defect and not a blessing?

49:01.140 --> 49:03.180
Well, I learned a lot about third nipples

49:03.180 --> 49:06.380
at a wedding I went to recently

49:07.480 --> 49:11.580
from a friend who just left med school.

49:11.580 --> 49:13.220
He graduated, he didn't leave it.

49:14.820 --> 49:15.660
That like-

49:15.660 --> 49:16.780
I hope he left it after.

49:16.780 --> 49:19.000
Nipples, third nipples aren't like

49:19.000 --> 49:20.620
what I imagined that they were,

49:20.620 --> 49:23.280
what Hollywood has made them out to be.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.120
Which is like-

49:24.120 --> 49:24.940
You were picturing like a whole nother nipple.

49:24.940 --> 49:26.860
I was thinking about like areolas.

49:27.700 --> 49:29.540
But no, like any, like you can have just like

49:29.540 --> 49:32.460
a little bumpus, a little tipple right there

49:32.460 --> 49:34.120
as long as it's on the milk line.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.660
So we can be like down like on your belly

49:37.660 --> 49:40.740
as long as it's on the milk line, it's probably a nipple.

49:40.740 --> 49:42.760
And I'm worried because I have like a freckle there

49:42.760 --> 49:44.040
that I've always had.

49:44.040 --> 49:44.900
Maybe it's not a freckle.

49:44.900 --> 49:46.300
Maybe it's a little bit more insidious

49:46.300 --> 49:48.460
and a lot more erogenous than that.

49:48.460 --> 49:51.420
Maybe that's like your two and a half nipple.

49:51.420 --> 49:55.140
What if from, I think the problem with the women

49:55.140 --> 49:57.740
that you're dating is that they're not ready.

49:57.740 --> 50:00.340
But I don't think, I think you need to prepare them

50:00.340 --> 50:03.020
without spoiling it exactly what it is.

50:03.020 --> 50:04.380
So try this.

50:04.380 --> 50:06.580
Once you're, when you're at dinner,

50:06.580 --> 50:09.100
every once in a while, just start doing a little shake

50:09.100 --> 50:12.660
back and forth in your seat and sing like a little like,

50:12.660 --> 50:15.980
I have got a surprise for you.

50:15.980 --> 50:16.820
No.

50:16.820 --> 50:21.620
A little better, I have got something secret and special.

50:21.620 --> 50:24.900
There will be a moonlight revelation tonight.

50:24.900 --> 50:28.700
I hope that you like fun buttons.

50:28.700 --> 50:32.420
Don't make a mistake before 30 time

50:32.420 --> 50:35.620
or you're gonna miss this special surprise.

50:35.620 --> 50:39.260
All your friends will talk about my fun button

50:39.260 --> 50:41.780
that you've never got to see.

50:41.780 --> 50:44.440
Also, I'm fucking all your friends.

50:44.440 --> 50:47.900
Could you do something where every time

50:47.900 --> 50:51.260
like the waiter brings dinner, you say like,

50:51.260 --> 50:53.740
I don't know, do I want two broccolis?

50:53.740 --> 50:55.060
Well, I guess I want three.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.140
Cause that's one more.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.780
It's nice to have more, right?

51:02.900 --> 51:05.020
I don't think this is a curse.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.180
I think it's a beautiful blessing.

51:07.180 --> 51:11.740
Cause you will, this person categorically, mathematically

51:11.740 --> 51:16.740
will experience more erogenous pleasure

51:16.820 --> 51:20.140
than any of us could ever aspire to.

51:20.140 --> 51:22.380
I experienced more nipple pleasure this morning

51:22.380 --> 51:24.180
than you will in your entire life.

51:24.180 --> 51:29.180
Like when we reach the end and God tallies up our score.

51:30.660 --> 51:33.860
When he sorts the light into heaven by nipple pleasure.

51:33.860 --> 51:36.300
No, I mean, it's not, it doesn't have anything to do like,

51:36.300 --> 51:38.900
you know, St. Peter letting us in any, like a queue.

51:38.900 --> 51:39.980
I'm saying there's like a-

51:39.980 --> 51:40.900
But just in the book.

51:40.900 --> 51:43.500
I'm saying he's going to take it to the leaderboards, Mo.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.800
And then there's going to be nipple pleasure.

51:46.800 --> 51:50.580
And then this person will have beaten all of us by 50%.

51:50.580 --> 51:52.700
Well, Mike, a lot of our contestants today

51:52.700 --> 51:55.020
have experienced a lot of nipple pleasure,

51:55.020 --> 51:59.280
but the number one is this weird guy with three nipples.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.220
All right, let's go to that radical rock.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.160
Mo.

52:04.660 --> 52:09.180
Heaven in my mind, it's just an agro crack.

52:09.180 --> 52:11.580
And it's not like the basic agro crack.

52:11.580 --> 52:12.700
Fuck that basic shit.

52:12.700 --> 52:14.500
I'm talking about the global guts crack

52:14.500 --> 52:16.380
with like steam and shit coming off.

52:16.380 --> 52:19.820
Like the one that like, with like buzz saw traps and shit.

52:19.820 --> 52:21.380
And I imagine that as you walk up it,

52:21.380 --> 52:22.940
instead of hitting actuators,

52:22.940 --> 52:26.020
you're like high-fiving like Gandhi and like,

52:26.020 --> 52:29.740
just all the, oh, there's eye sign, high five.

52:29.740 --> 52:30.880
Gandhi, why were you so chill?

52:30.880 --> 52:32.460
Check the chest.

52:32.460 --> 52:34.740
Oh shit, I didn't know.

52:34.740 --> 52:37.820
Yeah, yeah, I kept it hidden.

52:37.820 --> 52:41.420
That one's not in the diaries, but you know.

52:41.420 --> 52:45.500
Do you think that if, I mean, if you have a third nipple,

52:45.500 --> 52:47.300
isn't that God's way of telling you

52:47.300 --> 52:51.420
you should invite another partner into your sexual liaisons?

52:51.420 --> 52:53.940
Because it seems like you'll never get full stimulation

52:53.940 --> 52:56.140
with just one measly part.

52:56.140 --> 53:00.820
Or one partner also has an extra nipple,

53:00.820 --> 53:02.740
six nipples, two bodies, one bed.

53:02.740 --> 53:04.140
Six nipples, two bodies.

53:04.140 --> 53:05.540
Because it's got to match up like

53:05.540 --> 53:07.460
when you plug a plug into an outlet,

53:07.460 --> 53:09.780
you just have the two-prong outlet,

53:09.780 --> 53:11.180
but you got the three-prong plug.

53:11.180 --> 53:12.020
You're like, it's not gonna work.

53:12.020 --> 53:14.740
That's why you gotta invite another friend

53:14.740 --> 53:17.540
who only has one nipple to be your sexual adapter.

53:17.540 --> 53:18.660
Nice.

53:18.660 --> 53:20.960
I think it's God's way of saying

53:20.960 --> 53:23.180
you could be a lot more laissez-faire

53:23.180 --> 53:25.060
with your nipple security.

53:25.060 --> 53:27.260
Because if you lose it, good news,

53:27.260 --> 53:28.940
back up, just scoot it up.

53:28.940 --> 53:30.460
If a girl.

53:30.460 --> 53:32.020
God, should I go skydiving?

53:32.020 --> 53:33.260
I don't know, fuck it.

53:33.260 --> 53:34.100
You got three?

53:34.100 --> 53:34.940
You got three.

53:34.940 --> 53:35.760
What's the worst that could happen?

53:35.760 --> 53:38.860
I'm gonna give you a bonus one so you could get risky.

53:38.860 --> 53:40.920
YOLO and also,

53:42.780 --> 53:43.980
hold on.

53:43.980 --> 53:44.820
Yep.

53:44.820 --> 53:45.640
Yuh.

53:49.940 --> 53:51.620
What were you trying for?

53:54.540 --> 53:56.380
Which is, you have three nipples.

53:58.980 --> 54:03.700
Whatever sound you made, it's like the foley work

54:03.700 --> 54:07.100
for the thing stalking me down a metal hallway.

54:07.100 --> 54:08.540
That's the noise you made with your nipple.

54:08.540 --> 54:09.740
That was the original song,

54:09.740 --> 54:12.140
but Drake couldn't find a thing to rhyme it with.

54:14.080 --> 54:15.580
You only have three nipples.

54:15.580 --> 54:16.420
Pfft.

54:21.020 --> 54:21.860
Crud.

54:21.860 --> 54:22.980
Well, folks, that's gonna do it for us.

54:22.980 --> 54:24.860

54:50.340 --> 54:52.740
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:52.740 --> 54:55.540
If you were at Max Fun Con this past weekend,

54:55.540 --> 54:56.900
you probably got a chance to hang out with him,

54:56.900 --> 54:57.840
you piece of shit.

54:57.840 --> 55:00.700
Sorry, I'm just jealous.

55:00.700 --> 55:03.140
I bet that'd be a cool life experience.

55:03.140 --> 55:03.980
No big deal.

55:03.980 --> 55:04.820
Not a big deal.

55:04.820 --> 55:06.140
Thank you to everybody else who came to our New York shows.

55:17.320 --> 55:20.640

55:20.640 --> 55:23.180
who made some of our mom's famous chest bars

55:23.180 --> 55:26.020
for his friend, fuck a D.

55:26.020 --> 55:27.580
Fuck a D?

55:27.580 --> 55:28.620
Fuck a D.

55:28.620 --> 55:30.980

55:39.260 --> 55:41.940
a video of a horse at us, which is fine.

55:41.940 --> 55:42.780
I'll take that.

55:42.780 --> 55:43.600
I appreciate that.

55:43.600 --> 55:44.440
Sure.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.260
It's a horse playing a saxophone, it looks like.

55:45.260 --> 55:46.100
Yeah, why not?

You wanna thank yourself?

55:58.020 --> 56:00.060
Good to work, my friend.

56:00.060 --> 56:01.660
Good God, I gotta thank myself.

56:01.660 --> 56:04.860
Martin is an adorable baby who's tweeting about our show,

56:04.860 --> 56:07.060
so I'm not sure what's going on there.

56:07.060 --> 56:08.820
And everybody else, thanks so much.

56:09.780 --> 56:10.740
Let's shut it down.

All right.

56:13.820 --> 56:15.220
This final Yahoo was sent in by Aaron.

56:15.220 --> 56:16.560
Thank you, Aaron.

56:16.560 --> 56:19.860
It's by Yahoo Answers user Chief Keef, who asks,

56:21.060 --> 56:24.780
who is the youngest person living right now?

56:24.780 --> 56:27.140
Well, think about it.

56:27.140 --> 56:29.100
Deep, deep.

56:29.100 --> 56:31.020
Think about that.

56:35.260 --> 56:36.820
It's been my brother and my brother and me.

56:36.820 --> 56:38.860
Kiss your dad, spray on the lips, think about it.

56:38.860 --> 56:39.700
Just think about it.

56:39.700 --> 56:40.540
Think about it.

56:40.540 --> 56:41.380
Think about it.

56:41.380 --> 56:42.200

Have you made vacation plans yet?

57:07.220 --> 57:10.140
The second annual Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival

57:22.500 --> 57:25.460

57:25.460 --> 57:27.540
And frankly, we've impressed even ourselves

57:27.540 --> 57:29.880
with this lineup of bullseye favorites.

57:29.880 --> 57:31.140
You've got Moshe Kasher.

57:31.140 --> 57:32.860
I was in an airport recently.

57:32.860 --> 57:34.840
You ever see somebody and you're just like,

57:34.840 --> 57:38.540
oh, so you're what's wrong with everything in the world?

57:38.540 --> 57:39.460
Kyle Kinane.

57:39.460 --> 57:41.500
Anybody else in here get so drunk last month

57:41.500 --> 57:44.180
you had to call a cab just to take you to Wendy's?

57:45.400 --> 57:47.100
W. Kamau Bell.

57:47.100 --> 57:49.140
So complicated, my feelings.

57:51.020 --> 57:52.140
Morgan Murphy.

57:52.140 --> 57:53.860
I don't know if you guys know what a facelift is.

57:53.860 --> 57:57.060
It's when they take your face skin

57:57.060 --> 57:59.860
and they peel it away from your face,

57:59.860 --> 58:01.220
and in that little space there,

58:01.220 --> 58:03.180
that's where they find your self-esteem.

58:04.300 --> 58:06.900
And besides them, Greg Barrett, Chris Fairbanks,

58:06.900 --> 58:09.460
