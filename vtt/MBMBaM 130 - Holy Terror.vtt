00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:51.280
Can you feel it in the air? Everything's frosty.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.960
What's that smell? Is that pine? Of course it's pine.

00:54.960 --> 01:03.440
Why is there pine in my nose? Something tells me we on that Christmas creep.

01:03.440 --> 01:07.280
We on that Christmas creep? We on that Christmas creep.

01:07.840 --> 01:13.840
I'm sorry guys, do you mean holiday creep? No, I mean Christmas creep.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.560
You're fucking- Do you mean non-denominational,

01:16.560 --> 01:20.960
non-offensive holiday creep? No, I'm on that going to heaven creep.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.760
Get your socialist moon bat ideologies out of here, Travis.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.000
This product was brought to you by the red, white, and the blue.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.160
Keep your war on Jesus where it belongs in my new religious based fighting game.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.880
Holy terror. Holy terror.

01:41.440 --> 01:47.440
It's in full effect here in the ATX. Our street is known for its extravagant

01:47.440 --> 01:53.520
Christmas light displays, and I am paralyzed by fear of not being able to live up to the

01:53.520 --> 01:56.080
expectations. Do you have a plan, Griffin?

01:57.360 --> 02:01.280
I do, and it's- A design that you're shooting for?

02:02.000 --> 02:05.680
Sort of like a Jackson Pollock of light, you know what I mean?

02:06.320 --> 02:08.640
It's sort of like a- Just slopping something up there.

02:08.640 --> 02:13.200
Just slopping, just maybe sort of like a Kevin Pollock of light, and maybe I'll do like,

02:13.200 --> 02:17.280
I'll do like, I'll cover myself in lights and then stand up in the front yard and just do my

02:17.280 --> 02:22.000
favorite Kevin Pollock routine, and I'll do that day in and day out, and that can be the whole

02:22.000 --> 02:24.240
display. It's like fun- When you say your favorite Kevin

02:24.240 --> 02:28.400
Pollock routine, do you mean like you would be doing an impression of Kevin Pollock doing an

02:28.400 --> 02:31.360
impression of someone else? That is precisely what I mean.

02:31.360 --> 02:37.200
It's fun for kids, it's fun for adults, it's fun for your grandma and your dog,

02:37.200 --> 02:41.200
but not for Kevin Pollock. If he comes around, I'm gonna have to do

02:41.200 --> 02:44.800
someone else. Yeah, you're gonna have to do

02:44.800 --> 02:50.560
someone else doing Gryffindor walking. So just throw in some- Do you have any,

02:50.560 --> 02:54.480
I mean, do you have any expertise with wiring or anything like that?

02:54.480 --> 02:57.920
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Wiring, electricity, electrodes.

02:57.920 --> 03:01.680
Are you gonna have to wire it up? Gryffin, if you could wire it up so that

03:01.680 --> 03:05.920
like every time you flush the toilet, like Santa would wave, so that your neighbors really know

03:06.480 --> 03:07.760
how it's going. Could the-

03:07.760 --> 03:11.840
Maybe the lights are spelled out in a way that just makes it say,

03:11.840 --> 03:15.360
I just pooped. And then people will know, people will know that.

03:15.360 --> 03:22.720
I think Gryffin's gonna have the oversized like PSA

03:24.560 --> 03:28.640
plug that Louie the Lightning Bug warned us about. That outlet with like

03:29.360 --> 03:34.800
eight different plugs plugged into it. Gryffin, just remember, you gotta play it

03:34.800 --> 03:40.080
safer on electricity. I'm gonna have it going into a European

03:40.080 --> 03:45.360
converter and then back into an American converter. It's gonna be disgusting.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.240
And then- Gryffin, is there a potato in the middle of

03:48.240 --> 03:51.280
your extension cord? Gryffin, is this a hyperconductive

03:51.280 --> 03:54.240
piece of produce that you've used, you've lodged in here?

03:56.400 --> 04:02.480
At the end of the day, you got yams. That's not how it works?

04:02.480 --> 04:05.280
Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. If you cook a potato-

04:05.280 --> 04:07.760
Plus electrical equivalent does not equal yams.

04:07.760 --> 04:12.400
Yeah, that's how they turn. Let's answer some questions.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.960
This is an advice show for the modern era after all.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.160
Did we introduce ourselves? I don't believe we did.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.800
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Chavis McElroy.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.080
I'm your sweet baby brother, Gryffin McElroy.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.800
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.880
And here we go. I'm moving schools in a month,

04:32.880 --> 04:35.840
and I had an idea. I'm gonna pretend I can't smell

04:35.840 --> 04:39.760
at my new school. It's just a little thing that will

04:39.760 --> 04:43.360
make me unique. Is this a good idea?

04:43.360 --> 04:48.480
Any ideas on why I can't smell? How about because you're an angel,

04:48.480 --> 04:51.120
and because angels can't smell. Is that fun enough for you?

04:52.080 --> 04:53.440
You're an angel sent by God.

04:53.440 --> 04:58.560
What are you doing?

05:00.880 --> 05:05.280
Have you casually dropped that you can't smell

05:05.280 --> 05:08.160
in a conversation at your new school? When someone's just like,

05:09.120 --> 05:12.960
smell the french fries in the lunch room. I can't.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.240
I smell that Christmas creep. I'm not aware of any Christmas creep.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.920
I certainly cannot. You know,

05:18.720 --> 05:21.120
this is gonna be all negative for you because you're gonna

05:21.120 --> 05:23.440
constantly have to keep in your mind that you can't smell

05:23.440 --> 05:25.760
that horrible thing that you smell. But not only that,

05:25.760 --> 05:29.280
your friends are gonna test this shit constantly.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.480
You are gonna have four butts around your head farting at all times

05:33.200 --> 05:35.040
just so that people will be like, oh, what's wrong?

05:37.920 --> 05:40.880
Let's assume that you're in high school. When you drop something like,

05:40.880 --> 05:45.600
oh no, I've lost the ability to smell, high school students do not

05:45.600 --> 05:47.520
inherently go, oh, okay, I accept that.

05:48.080 --> 05:48.640
Interesting.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.760
Yeah, of course.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.040
It could be college, but even college students, I think,

05:53.040 --> 05:57.440
haven't mastered the curve yet where they're like, oh, I understand

05:57.440 --> 06:01.600
and I will be more sensitive to that. Next time we drop by that bakery,

06:01.600 --> 06:02.960
I won't say anything about it.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.080
I haven't learned tact yet, so smell everything.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.680
Everybody, when they go to a new school, has to adopt some sort of affectation.

06:13.680 --> 06:18.800
That's like, even if you find that process completely douche-tastic,

06:19.360 --> 06:22.480
it's gonna happen, you've gotta do it, or else you'll be eaten alive.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.040
I'm just not sure this is the one.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.280
The things that you could do to make yourself unique,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.200
not being able to smell is one of the least attractive,

06:31.200 --> 06:32.480
least interesting ones.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.440
It's so high pressure and it's so easily disproven.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.520
Why not go with something that's more...

06:41.520 --> 06:43.200
Like, I met Donny Osmond.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.720
Like, nobody can, unless they hunt down Donny Osmond.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.920
I am Donny Osmond.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.520
Do you remember this fool, Donny?

06:49.520 --> 06:52.400
Like, that's the only way that that's gonna be disproven.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.920
I think you're thinking too small.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.320
I think you need to pretend you're a kid who can't walk.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.240
What about that?

06:58.240 --> 06:58.480
Wow.

06:58.480 --> 06:58.980
Okay.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.240
Ooh, ooh, pretend you're a kid who can't walk.

07:02.240 --> 07:07.360
Keep it up for like two months and then start to improve.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.400
Mm.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.000
Oh, I love that.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.080
Start to gain the ability to walk.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.320
Does the school rally behind you?

07:14.320 --> 07:14.720
Yes.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.360
Oh, oh, oh, before you put on this ruse,

07:17.360 --> 07:21.200
can you train your body to be like the world's fastest runner?

07:21.200 --> 07:23.600
And then now that's a kid's...

07:23.600 --> 07:26.080
Every fucking day some kid stands up from his wheelchair

07:26.080 --> 07:27.040
and starts walking.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.240
That's not cool.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.440
You know what's cool?

07:29.440 --> 07:30.560
A billion dollars.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.840
What I'm saying is practice basketball a lot.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.120
Get great at basketball.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.080
So at the end they're like, coach, coach,

07:40.720 --> 07:44.240
if Wheelie Rob isn't gonna play, I'm not gonna play.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.640
He's learning to walk and I'm proud of him.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.120
Yeah.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.600
And then they'll be like, give it to, put in Rob, put in Rob.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.760
And then you'll get it like, what?

07:53.760 --> 07:57.040
I guess this whole time I've been great at dunking.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
And then you look as surprised as anybody.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.680
Another idea is you just get really good at basketball

08:03.680 --> 08:05.680
and then you'll be fucking popular

08:05.680 --> 08:07.280
because you're really good at basketball

08:07.280 --> 08:09.120
and you don't have to pretend to be handicapped.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.520
Listen, I think that terminology may be offensive.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.000
I have a hard time keeping up.

08:17.920 --> 08:18.560
What's the...

08:18.560 --> 08:23.040
The first day go in and say, I have anosmia.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.560
I got it from a nasal spray.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.400
I use the nasal spray too much.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.080
I was too congested.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.280
Is there a kid who's gonna hear that and go,

08:35.280 --> 08:38.880
oh, fucking cool, he used too much nasal spray.

08:38.880 --> 08:43.520
And then if anybody busts you on it, you say, no, my bad.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.200
I said, insomnia.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.560
And I have a hard time getting to sleep at night.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.440
How about, okay, I'm gonna throw out, it's a little change,

08:51.440 --> 08:53.520
but I think it'll make it easier to keep up the ruse.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.880
Instead of saying you can't smell, say you don't smell.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.840
Like you've made a choice.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.760
Smell this, like, oh no, I choose not to.

09:01.760 --> 09:02.960
I would rather not smell.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.360
Well, that's a good life advice regardless.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.160
If someone says, hey, smell this, usually the answer is no.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.000
Yeah, I would prefer not to.

09:12.000 --> 09:12.880
I choose not to.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
I think that you say the reason you,

09:17.040 --> 09:19.040
I think the reason that you lost your smelling

09:19.040 --> 09:21.200
is the important part of the story.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.040
I think it can't be something tame.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.280
I think it's gotta be like you went on a Coke bender.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.520
Maybe you went on a Coke bender with Donny Osmond

09:27.520 --> 09:29.920
and then it's the best of both worlds.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.480
Griffin, please give us the Yahoo question.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.440
Sure, this Yahoo question is sent in by Michael Lee.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.400
Thank you, Michael.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.320
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.680
Somebody explain what that meant.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.080
I think it's like the person deleted their account,

09:42.080 --> 09:45.280
which I love that Yahoo Answers treasures their questions

09:45.280 --> 09:48.080
so much that they don't just delete the questions too.

09:49.760 --> 09:54.000
Question Mark asks, how do I un-potty train myself?

09:54.000 --> 10:00.640
How do I un-potty train myself?

10:00.640 --> 10:04.080
I am a teen baby and really want to know

10:04.080 --> 10:06.640
how to un-potty train myself night and day

10:06.640 --> 10:08.480
so I can be more like a baby again.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.040
Yep.

10:11.040 --> 10:11.840
Just wait.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.920
Just wait, like wait 60 years.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.600
Close your eyes, relax.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.200
And wait for 60 years.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.040
You'll be un-potty trained, easy.

10:21.040 --> 10:21.540
I guess.

10:21.540 --> 10:23.380
Easy.

10:23.380 --> 10:25.540
It sounds like this guy is looking for a better answer

10:25.540 --> 10:28.340
than just poop and pee in your pants

10:28.340 --> 10:30.660
instead of in the toilet like a big boy does,

10:30.660 --> 10:32.260
like you did on your big boy birthday.

10:34.020 --> 10:36.660
But I don't know what to tell him.

10:36.660 --> 10:38.980
Open your toilet and put scorpions in.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.660
That is an option to you.

10:43.460 --> 10:43.700
Yes.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.380
They're about to use the toilet.

10:45.380 --> 10:45.880
Don't.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.660
Okay, Josh, you think of it small.

10:48.660 --> 10:50.500
Let's go back to scorpions for a second.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.500
When you're about to use the toilet,

10:52.500 --> 10:55.300
you look at the toilet and say no, not today.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.300
And I will hear a million toilets screaming poop at us

10:59.300 --> 11:00.900
and I will whisper no.

11:03.220 --> 11:05.140
Can you remove the toilet from your house?

11:05.140 --> 11:06.820
Or better yet, can you have a friend do it

11:06.820 --> 11:08.180
when you least expect it?

11:11.300 --> 11:12.340
Oh, this?

11:12.340 --> 11:13.940
This is the bye-bye hole.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.700
There used to be a toilet here.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.180
Now I just put things in it I never want to see again.

11:18.180 --> 11:19.620
What?

11:19.620 --> 11:21.220
Like all of my friendships.

11:21.220 --> 11:22.020
And my dignity.

11:23.460 --> 11:24.900
Hey, Justin and Travis.

11:24.900 --> 11:25.400
Yeah.

11:25.940 --> 11:28.100
Can you explain to me what a teen baby is?

11:28.100 --> 11:32.420
And it's not, apparently it is not a baby sired by a teen,

11:32.420 --> 11:35.140
which is what I prayed to Jesus it did mean.

11:36.180 --> 11:41.380
So some people have chosen to live their life

11:41.380 --> 11:43.780
and I'm trying to be very diplomatic here

11:43.780 --> 11:46.820
because I'm sure there are people who listen to this show

11:46.820 --> 11:50.660
who are adult babies, but some people have chosen

11:51.380 --> 11:54.500
to live their lives as babies

11:55.540 --> 12:00.900
because that's what makes them happy to live as babies.

12:01.540 --> 12:07.780
And I'm not sure if it's completely always sexual in nature.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.500
If it's not sexual in nature, what is it?

12:11.220 --> 12:12.900
Because it sounds pretty fucking sexy.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.620
Here's my thing with adult babies.

12:15.620 --> 12:16.740
Okay.

12:16.740 --> 12:19.300
I mean, nice work if you can get it.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.300
I'd like to be a baby too.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.300
Like I think we'd all like to figure out

12:23.300 --> 12:26.260
how to put this particular genie back in the bottle.

12:28.660 --> 12:29.940
And I'd do re-bottle.

12:30.980 --> 12:32.580
If I may, even then.

12:32.580 --> 12:33.060
You may.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.780
Adult baby, I get that.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.100
Adults, tons of responsibility, it fucking sucks

12:38.100 --> 12:40.260
and you want to be a baby and just be taken care of.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.060
I get it.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.420
Teen baby, what's your life really like that's so hard?

12:44.420 --> 12:45.140
No, Travis.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.980
As a teenager that you're like,

12:46.980 --> 12:48.980
if only I could regress eight years.

12:48.980 --> 12:50.260
Think back to high school.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.900
High school is, middle school especially,

12:52.900 --> 12:54.340
but high school to some extent,

12:54.340 --> 12:56.420
the worst part of your entire life.

12:56.420 --> 12:57.540
The absolute worst part.

12:57.540 --> 13:00.580
I feel like the reason that not all teenagers are teen babies

13:00.580 --> 13:03.300
is because they don't know that that's an option.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.820
Yeah, they can't just retreat.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.900
If there was some sort of awareness campaign like,

13:06.900 --> 13:09.220
hey, here's this crazy fetish you can get into

13:09.220 --> 13:10.740
and then you don't have to deal with the,

13:10.740 --> 13:13.140
you know, how none of your classmates like you,

13:13.140 --> 13:16.260
then that, I feel like it would become much more popular.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.220
I think that it would be like at least a secondary,

13:19.220 --> 13:21.220
maybe tertiary storyline on Glee.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.020
And honestly, I would say that if you,

13:24.020 --> 13:26.500
if you are charismatic enough,

13:26.500 --> 13:28.180
you could probably pull off teen baby

13:28.180 --> 13:30.100
and be one of the most popular kids in school.

13:30.100 --> 13:30.580
Travis.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.580
You would be like, ah, it's big baby, what's up?

13:33.700 --> 13:35.700
I think you're thinking of Teen Wolf.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.460
Yeah, Teen Wolf couldn't pull that.

13:37.460 --> 13:38.420
You're right, you guys, sorry.

13:38.420 --> 13:40.900
Oh, could you tell your new school that you're a werewolf?

13:40.900 --> 13:43.700
Oh, they would want to see some, some.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.220
They're gonna need to see Heartproof.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.620
Yeah, they're gonna need to see the long form.

13:47.620 --> 13:48.660
Tell them it's too dangerous.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.780
Now, the commitment is two days out of every month,

13:51.780 --> 13:52.980
you can't go to school.

13:53.940 --> 13:56.100
You don't want to see me, I get super Randy

13:56.100 --> 13:57.700
and I'm real good at basketball

13:57.700 --> 13:59.460
and I surf on top of my friend's van.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.700
It's too dangerous, you don't want to see this.

14:02.820 --> 14:06.740
I do want to update everybody about teen babies.

14:06.740 --> 14:11.780
You can go to the tbjumpstation.tripod.com

14:12.580 --> 14:16.820
and find a whole web network of great links

14:17.460 --> 14:21.380
to TBDL and bedwetter sites.

14:21.380 --> 14:21.860
All right.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.540
Now, here's the really important thing.

14:25.140 --> 14:31.620
I find this web design more offensive than teen babies.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.140
I find it more upsetting.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.260
Uh, there are lists of links

14:36.260 --> 14:39.380
and they have put pictures of sunglasses

14:39.380 --> 14:40.820
next to the best ones.

14:41.940 --> 14:46.180
Like for instance, good old Andy's play pin

14:46.180 --> 14:50.100
at ibigbaby.net, that's got sunglasses.

14:50.580 --> 14:53.860
Jared's diaper site, which is not a good name,

14:53.860 --> 14:55.300
has sunglasses.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.660
Now, why is that not a good name?

14:56.660 --> 14:57.860
Because it sounds like it gets straight

14:57.860 --> 14:59.780
to the heart of the matter.

15:01.060 --> 15:02.260
I think it's Jared.

15:02.260 --> 15:04.980
I think it's an odd comparison.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.220
There's one called teens who wear diapers,

15:07.220 --> 15:08.420
which is direct.

15:08.420 --> 15:11.780
Again, we are getting into the nitty gritty.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.780
I enjoy, my favorite personal website

15:15.780 --> 15:17.780
is Tony's nappy place.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.100
God, these are also so real.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
No, here's the best advice

15:24.100 --> 15:26.100
you're ever gonna get from a bim bam.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.740
Never take a nap or become unconscious

15:28.740 --> 15:31.380
in any way around anyone named Tony.

15:31.380 --> 15:32.420
Ever.

15:32.420 --> 15:33.220
Ever.

15:35.860 --> 15:38.580
Now, those are just the premium links.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.260
If you're willing to go down.

15:40.260 --> 15:41.780
To get down into the snickle frit.

15:41.780 --> 15:45.860
If you're willing to get down into the chaff,

15:46.900 --> 15:49.460
might I suggest angelfire.com

15:49.460 --> 15:53.460
forward slash ct forward slash poop2

15:53.460 --> 15:57.940
and you'll be transported to Baby Sammy's Baby Summers,

15:58.660 --> 15:59.860
which is this,

15:59.860 --> 16:02.580
I think it's supposed to be a series of stories

16:02.580 --> 16:04.020
about Baby Sammy,

16:04.020 --> 16:06.260
but there is just one story called

16:06.260 --> 16:09.060
Baby Sammy's First Ever Baby Summer.

16:09.060 --> 16:10.420
And yes, you guessed it.

16:10.420 --> 16:12.660
It does have 30,000 views.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.980
Jesus, is there any website

16:16.260 --> 16:18.820
on tripod or angel fire remaining

16:18.820 --> 16:21.940
that isn't about fucking people in really weird ways?

16:24.020 --> 16:29.140
I can't find any if there are

16:29.140 --> 16:30.340
and I've looked.

16:30.340 --> 16:31.700
Oh, have I looked.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.860
It's like if you have a baking website,

16:33.860 --> 16:37.620
you transfer from Angel Fire to Tumblr in like 2005.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.620
I feel like the people who haven't gotten the net

16:39.620 --> 16:41.940
are the people who spend their entire day

16:41.940 --> 16:45.540
pretending to be fucking babies that are 38 years old.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.020
Not that there's anything wrong with it

16:48.020 --> 16:49.700
despite the tone of my voice right now.

16:50.820 --> 16:52.020
I know it may sound,

16:52.820 --> 16:55.700
it sounds angry and confused and a little worried,

16:55.700 --> 16:58.420
but it's totally kosher.

16:59.780 --> 17:00.280
Right.

17:02.020 --> 17:05.060
I just, I'm not angry.

17:05.620 --> 17:06.420
I'm not judging.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.540
I'm just, I'm just confused.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.460
I want to know if it's like a full on

17:12.420 --> 17:14.820
like diaper bib rattle lifestyle

17:14.820 --> 17:16.340
or if it's like a mental thing

17:16.340 --> 17:18.820
that like you just know deep inside that you're a baby

17:18.820 --> 17:20.020
and that's enough to get you through.

17:20.020 --> 17:22.660
I want to know what that match.com profile looks like.

17:22.660 --> 17:26.260
Like do you come right out with it?

17:26.820 --> 17:29.140
Because it sounds like a pretty defining thing in your life.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.060
I think you should probably figure out

17:31.060 --> 17:33.380
how people are going to be with that.

17:33.380 --> 17:38.100
I think you got to get a read on that before anything.

17:38.980 --> 17:41.060
You think it's going to hit some people's palette

17:41.060 --> 17:45.140
and be like, no, it has a nice finish.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.340
It's like a raspberry jelly.

17:46.340 --> 17:48.500
I wasn't expecting it, but it's very refreshing.

17:48.500 --> 17:54.500
Hey, that, maybe it's good to be a teen baby

17:54.500 --> 17:57.220
because you get it out of your system.

17:57.220 --> 17:58.660
For instance, when I was a teen,

17:59.220 --> 18:00.580
I took cotillion classes

18:00.580 --> 18:02.660
and thought the Heights was a pretty good band.

18:02.660 --> 18:03.140
So maybe-

18:03.140 --> 18:08.660
Wait, so wait, if you're a teen baby,

18:08.660 --> 18:10.580
then do you grow up to be an adult teen

18:10.580 --> 18:12.660
and then you grow up to be a senior adult

18:12.660 --> 18:15.380
and then eventually you're just, you're just-

18:15.380 --> 18:18.660
Actually, Cloris Leachman, just an old, old lady

18:18.660 --> 18:20.900
with the heart of like a 45 year old.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.820
You can actually keep going back.

18:22.820 --> 18:24.820
You can keep rewinding to baby.

18:24.820 --> 18:27.620
It's like that movie Big, but the complete opposite.

18:27.620 --> 18:28.500
It's called Small.

18:28.500 --> 18:31.060
It's called Small over and over again,

18:31.060 --> 18:32.980
starring Tom Hanks as a teen baby.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.100
Well, that's what, that's what-

18:36.100 --> 18:37.540
Oh, that's right, sorry.

18:37.540 --> 18:38.820
That's copyright infringement.

18:39.540 --> 18:40.980
I have a severe problem.

18:41.940 --> 18:44.660
I got an interview to apply to Cambridge.

18:44.660 --> 18:48.340
However, two days before, I'm also going to a party.

18:48.340 --> 18:51.860
I'd quite like to get characteristically wasted,

18:51.860 --> 18:54.340
but I need to be on the ball for this interview.

18:54.340 --> 18:57.060
So how can I make sure I have fun at the party

18:57.060 --> 19:00.340
whilst maintaining a hangover less interview?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.100
That's from Blasted and Blighty.

19:03.700 --> 19:07.940
Man, I've gotten, I've gotten fully Blasty Blasted before

19:07.940 --> 19:10.980
and I have never had a hungover, hangover for two days.

19:10.980 --> 19:14.100
That's never, I have never had a 48 hour.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.980
That would be rough.

19:16.980 --> 19:17.620
Yes.

19:17.620 --> 19:18.900
One, that's amazing.

19:18.900 --> 19:22.020
If you do that, you should tell some kind of news program

19:22.020 --> 19:23.060
and get on TV.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.500
And then some sort of counselor.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.460
48 hour hangover.

19:26.820 --> 19:33.940
Secondly, don't, don't, like just don't.

19:34.900 --> 19:38.340
Do you, are you writing into an internet advice show

19:38.340 --> 19:41.780
because you don't know how to not get so drunk

19:41.780 --> 19:43.140
that you're drunk for two days?

19:43.860 --> 19:44.260
Is that?

19:44.260 --> 19:45.700
You don't know how to not get so drunk

19:45.700 --> 19:47.780
that you ruin your future?

19:47.780 --> 19:50.020
Like, just don't.

19:50.020 --> 19:53.060
This isn't like, but the girl of my dreams is gonna be there

19:53.060 --> 19:57.380
and I'm worried that if I don't, just, just don't.

19:57.380 --> 19:57.860
Don't.

19:57.860 --> 19:58.900
Just don't.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.340
Maybe, maybe go to the party, say hello to some friends

20:02.340 --> 20:05.140
and then excuse yourself at a reasonable hour.

20:05.140 --> 20:07.220
Go home and think about how great it's gonna be

20:07.220 --> 20:09.620
to graduate from a good college with a great education.

20:12.100 --> 20:15.780
And just don't drink that much.

20:15.780 --> 20:16.500
Just don't.

20:17.460 --> 20:18.500
Maybe space it out.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.940
One drink, one glass of water.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.380
One drink, one glass of water.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.940
Just really hold yourself back.

20:24.580 --> 20:26.660
You have a lot of options as far as moderation goes,

20:26.660 --> 20:29.940
but I am actually, I am shocked at you two

20:31.220 --> 20:34.020
for telling him not to YOLO

20:34.020 --> 20:37.620
because you do only live once

20:37.620 --> 20:41.140
and then that's gonna end in like 23 days

20:41.140 --> 20:42.660
when Quetzalcoatl comes out.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.580
And so like, it's, we can't really,

20:44.580 --> 20:47.060
I feel like it's irresponsible for us not to say,

20:47.060 --> 20:49.860
you know, YOLO, YOLO, live like you were dying.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.780
Is there a thing for a live like you were?

20:51.780 --> 20:54.180
But is there any way to like, transition it and say,

20:54.180 --> 20:56.100
yes, it's YOLO, but it's also like a

20:56.100 --> 20:57.860
choose your own adventure YOLO

20:57.860 --> 20:59.380
and you could say you only live once,

20:59.380 --> 21:00.740
it's time to get wasted at this party

21:00.740 --> 21:01.860
or you only live once,

21:01.860 --> 21:03.700
I should prepare for this big interview.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.660
Okay, but have you, when teens use YOLO,

21:07.380 --> 21:10.180
when teens exercise their YOLO,

21:10.900 --> 21:14.180
they don't, it's always like they're jumping off of a bridge

21:14.180 --> 21:16.580
with a bungee cord and they're like, YOLO.

21:16.580 --> 21:18.340
You never see a teen like walking into

21:18.340 --> 21:19.700
like an important college interview,

21:19.700 --> 21:21.620
like, all right, man, YOLO.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.980
And then he comes in the door

21:22.980 --> 21:25.780
because then the interviewer is like, what's a YOLO?

21:26.580 --> 21:28.100
Explain to me what a YOLO is.

21:28.100 --> 21:35.780
Speaking of which, this week I was a little tipsy

21:36.340 --> 21:46.660
and I came up with a great slogan for a frozen yogurt stand

21:46.660 --> 21:48.740
and the lady who's producing our musical,

21:48.740 --> 21:50.340
one of the two ladies producing our musical

21:51.860 --> 21:53.540
that Sydney and I are working on right now

21:53.540 --> 21:56.980
is in the frozen yogurt business.

21:58.260 --> 22:05.220
So I texted her, I said, I got a great slogan for you.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.940
Check this out, fro YOLO.

22:08.580 --> 22:11.060
And she said it was great

22:11.060 --> 22:12.980
and admitted to me two days later,

22:12.980 --> 22:15.060
she had never heard YOLO.

22:15.060 --> 22:20.820
So it probably did not come off as a great slogan in the moment.

22:20.820 --> 22:24.660
But now it's a great slogan, I call it fro yo Baggins.

22:26.020 --> 22:26.980
Fro YOLO.

22:27.620 --> 22:31.540
Okay, that's not, I don't understand.

22:31.540 --> 22:32.180
It means nothing to me.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.780
That doesn't mean anything to me.

22:33.780 --> 22:34.980
I respect you as a person.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.540
Arrangement of all capitalized letters.

22:37.540 --> 22:40.340
But okay, thank you for passing that on.

22:40.340 --> 22:42.260
And then I made a point of saying

22:42.260 --> 22:43.940
that she could use it for free.

22:43.940 --> 22:46.980
I didn't want there to be any sort of question of payment.

22:46.980 --> 22:51.460
Like it's just hers, gratis.

22:51.460 --> 22:53.220
I'm surprised at you, Justin.

22:53.220 --> 22:53.860
Why?

22:53.860 --> 22:55.460
Don't sell yourself so short.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.820
You're right, I should have charged.

22:59.060 --> 23:00.740
Your future wife could be at this party.

23:00.740 --> 23:01.240
What's up?

23:02.500 --> 23:03.300
What's up now?

23:03.300 --> 23:06.100
Yeah, your future wife could also attend Cambridge.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.100
Yeah, but that's much less likely, don't you think?

23:08.100 --> 23:08.900
No, I'm sorry.

23:09.540 --> 23:13.700
Your future wife is probably not gonna be knocked off her feet

23:13.700 --> 23:16.100
by the guy who literally knocked her off her feet

23:16.100 --> 23:18.580
because he's falling around the room drunk.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.620
Two day drunk.

23:21.620 --> 23:23.460
Why would you not want to be at the top of your game

23:23.460 --> 23:24.820
to meet the girl of your dreams?

23:25.940 --> 23:27.220
Do you guys not understand?

23:27.220 --> 23:28.900
This show is better when there's contention

23:28.900 --> 23:30.100
between the three of us.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.020
Of course he should go to the fucking interview.

23:32.020 --> 23:35.300
Of course go to the goddamn interview, of course.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.580
You dumb dumb.

23:36.580 --> 23:39.220
But it's way better if I'm like, what if he likes to-

23:39.220 --> 23:41.300
I know, why are you tearing down the walls?

23:41.300 --> 23:42.100
Why are you-

23:42.100 --> 23:43.540
Because it sounds like you guys don't get it.

23:43.540 --> 23:44.660
And I don't want people to think

23:44.660 --> 23:46.820
that I'm endorsing irresponsible drinking.

23:48.020 --> 23:48.340
Just smoke-

23:48.340 --> 23:50.260
We endorse responsible drinking.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.140
Get really drunk after the interview

23:53.140 --> 23:55.140
to celebrate how awesome your interview went.

23:55.780 --> 23:58.580
Or get really drunk and then roll on some doja

23:58.580 --> 24:00.180
because they cancel each other out.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.540
Does the doja help?

24:01.540 --> 24:05.780
The doja gets in there and it fights the toxins of the alcohol.

24:05.780 --> 24:07.300
It lowers your content, actually.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.860
If you get pulled over, I saw it on Mythbusters,

24:09.860 --> 24:12.980
if you get pulled over and you're about to get DUI'd,

24:12.980 --> 24:15.460
you just roll a quick doja, if you-

24:15.460 --> 24:18.340
Yeah, that weed special was one of the weirdest episodes

24:18.340 --> 24:20.100
of Mythbusters I've ever seen.

24:20.100 --> 24:20.420
Yeah.

24:20.980 --> 24:24.820
Jamie Hyneman was like, yeah, man.

24:24.820 --> 24:25.460
My hands are shaking.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.660
That's what people sound like when they-

24:26.660 --> 24:27.300
I've never heard-

24:27.300 --> 24:28.260
I've never been around-

24:28.260 --> 24:29.620
Hey, I got an idea.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.780
Let's blast this cannon through that dude's house.

24:34.100 --> 24:34.820
Let's do it.

24:34.820 --> 24:36.740
It's a Mythbusters deep cut for everybody.

24:36.740 --> 24:44.820
Okay, I think if you don't end up hungover for the interview,

24:46.180 --> 24:47.780
you should announce that first.

24:48.740 --> 24:52.420
Say, good news, I'm not hungover for this.

24:53.060 --> 24:54.660
Listen, I don't want to brag.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.060
I don't want to brag, but I was really worried

24:58.020 --> 25:00.660
that I would still be hungover from two days ago,

25:00.660 --> 25:02.580
but it turned out that I wasn't.

25:02.580 --> 25:03.780
So what's your first question?

25:03.780 --> 25:05.860
First question, will I leave?

25:06.900 --> 25:07.620
Sure, yeah.

25:07.620 --> 25:07.860
Okay.

25:07.860 --> 25:09.140
Okay, let's go.

25:09.860 --> 25:10.740
Let's go to the Money Zone.

25:20.500 --> 25:23.620
Guys, we have the return today,

25:23.620 --> 25:26.500

26:02.660 --> 26:04.660
Yeah, like every professional podcast,

26:04.660 --> 26:07.460
we like to warn you before it's about the sound professional

26:08.420 --> 26:09.860
to give you a nice buffer.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.660
In case this transition is grating to your ears.

26:12.660 --> 26:14.100
Well, I didn't want them to be like,

26:14.100 --> 26:16.340
whoa, did my computer glitch out

26:16.340 --> 26:17.940
and now it's playing Radio Lab?

26:17.940 --> 26:19.220
Like, no, don't worry about it.

26:19.220 --> 26:21.540
It's super not still, super not Radio Lab.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.380
Although I can tell you all about science facts.

26:24.100 --> 26:26.980
Yeah, we're basically Radio Lab for cool people.

26:26.980 --> 26:28.500
Do you guys know what creates rainbows?

26:28.500 --> 26:31.860
What?

26:31.860 --> 26:33.380
Um, kid wishes.

26:34.100 --> 26:34.980
Gay dust.

26:34.980 --> 26:35.480
Hey!

26:36.100 --> 26:36.600
God.

26:37.060 --> 26:37.560
What?

26:38.260 --> 26:39.380
What's gay dust?

26:40.340 --> 26:44.980
It's from, I don't know, crunched up gay things.

26:48.180 --> 26:50.340
And if you want to crunch up some gay things,

26:50.340 --> 26:52.740
you need to head to streamerstraights.com.

26:52.740 --> 26:57.140
That's right.

26:57.140 --> 27:01.540
The magic's back for an unprecedented holiday spectacular.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.380
How people have been so cold.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.180
People have been like,

27:06.900 --> 27:09.540
people are like going around like breaking off chair legs

27:09.540 --> 27:11.060
and like trying to jam it in themselves

27:11.060 --> 27:12.260
because they don't know.

27:12.260 --> 27:14.900
They don't know what to do without our fucking guidance.

27:15.860 --> 27:19.300
This is like a extreme restraints presents

27:19.300 --> 27:21.380
my brother, my brother and me season two.

27:21.380 --> 27:24.260
Mm-hmm, we took a brief summer break,

27:24.260 --> 27:25.860
but now we're back with the new plot line.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.460
This is the season premiere.

27:27.460 --> 27:28.740
The season premiere.

27:28.740 --> 27:31.060
One of us buys some special balls

27:31.060 --> 27:33.220
that you put in your butt hole to make sex feel better.

27:34.660 --> 27:37.060
Strict, like here's my featured item today.

27:37.060 --> 27:40.740
Strict leather locking butt plug harness

27:40.740 --> 27:42.420
with an inflatable plug.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.940
So let me walk you through this.

27:43.940 --> 27:46.260
You gotta ring around your, your ding dong.

27:47.860 --> 27:50.020
You have a bucket full of poses.

27:50.020 --> 27:52.980
And a pocket full of, you have a belt

27:52.980 --> 27:54.980
that goes up to your belly button

27:54.980 --> 27:58.420
and then around your waist and through your butt hole.

27:59.140 --> 28:03.700
And then you can inflate it to make your butt bigger.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.700
I think that's how that works.

28:07.700 --> 28:11.940
Okay, can I drop some knowledge on you

28:11.940 --> 28:14.420
about the Strict Leather Cock Straight Jacket?

28:15.140 --> 28:15.540
Hit me.

28:16.340 --> 28:18.180
It's a straight jacket for your cock

28:18.180 --> 28:20.180
and also according to this picture,

28:21.060 --> 28:22.340
your balls also.

28:22.340 --> 28:24.260
Your whole ball, it's your whole unit.

28:24.260 --> 28:25.940
You get it tied up in this thing.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.500
God, I have like, I have like 14 dicks

28:28.500 --> 28:31.140
on my monitor right now.

28:32.580 --> 28:35.140
And you have to, I guess it's like a trick.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.380
It's like a stunt and you try to get it out.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.500
It's fun for the kids.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.780
It's fun for the whole family.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.820
You can do like Houdini, but with your,

28:42.820 --> 28:48.180
but it's like your dick instead of like an immigrant.

28:48.180 --> 28:48.660
Holy shit.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.980
Okay, you guys, I feel that when we do

28:50.980 --> 28:52.100
the Extreme Restraint spots,

28:52.100 --> 28:54.660
we have a tendency to focus on stuff for dudes.

28:56.020 --> 28:57.380
And so now I'm going to say,

28:58.580 --> 29:00.100
my product of the week

29:00.100 --> 29:02.580
is the Passionista Vibrating Strapless Strap-On.

29:03.860 --> 29:04.420
Hold up.

29:04.420 --> 29:05.060
Looks like.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.420
How does it strapless strap on?

29:09.380 --> 29:11.780
I don't even know, Griffin.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.460
And it adheres to your body through magic.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.060
Yes, it just will never let go.

29:17.060 --> 29:18.980
Once it's in, it never goes away.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.300
It's a permanent fixture now.

29:22.580 --> 29:25.060
Well, you're going to have to buy new pants, I guess.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.340
It's like an eight prong thing

29:29.380 --> 29:31.700
and it's just fun for everyone is what it says.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.860
And it looks fun for everyone.

29:33.860 --> 29:35.780
So it's like a, it's like a menorah?

29:38.340 --> 29:39.940
Yes, it's a sexy menorah.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.900
If you're looking for a perfect, perfect candle night's present,

29:43.860 --> 29:47.860
then this butt menorah is going to be your thing.

29:47.860 --> 29:50.020
I want you guys to know I keep looking at it and blushing.

29:50.740 --> 29:51.860
So check it out.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.500
If Travis's audio sounds bad right now,

29:54.500 --> 29:55.940
it's because he's got both of his hands

29:55.940 --> 29:57.380
in front of his mouth and he's giggling.

29:59.300 --> 30:02.020
Here's a quick sample of a review

30:02.020 --> 30:04.180
from the Strix Leather Locking Butt Plug Harness

30:04.180 --> 30:05.140
with Inflatable Plug.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.500
My wife buy this for me to wear to work

30:08.500 --> 30:12.020
and around the house, one day I was in the bedroom

30:12.020 --> 30:13.700
wearing this butt plug harness

30:13.700 --> 30:15.460
and the kids were out playing with their friends.

30:16.580 --> 30:20.500
Hey kids, hey kids, big news, big scoop

30:20.500 --> 30:22.180
from my brother, my brother and me.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.180
You thought you were having fun outside

30:24.180 --> 30:28.500
but your dad was having the real fun in the bedroom

30:28.500 --> 30:30.180
when you saw him through the window

30:30.180 --> 30:33.780
and he looked happy, that is why.

30:33.780 --> 30:35.460
It wasn't because he loves you.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.900
It was because he had-

30:36.900 --> 30:37.940
He does love you.

30:37.940 --> 30:42.100
He does love you but he also loves this apparently a balloon

30:42.100 --> 30:42.820
and it's asshole.

30:44.580 --> 30:46.660
Listen, we don't wanna scare you off with these.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.100
These products are more on the extreme side

30:50.100 --> 30:51.220
of extreme restraints.

30:52.420 --> 30:55.700
Maybe things are getting a little stale in the bedroom.

30:55.700 --> 31:01.460
They have all gradients of sexual pleasure tools

31:02.020 --> 31:03.300
for you to enjoy.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.460
Maybe you just wanna, maybe you just wanna Dilbo.

31:05.460 --> 31:07.380
Maybe you just want some lubricants.

31:07.380 --> 31:09.220
Maybe you want something with a little flavor.

31:09.220 --> 31:11.380
Then these are all things that you can play with

31:11.380 --> 31:13.700
and experiment with and it's safe and it's fun.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.020
It's called, they're called Dilbos, right?

31:18.020 --> 31:19.620
They're called Dilbos and listen,

31:19.620 --> 31:22.180
if you want your Dilbos at a bargain rate,

31:22.180 --> 31:24.580
you're gonna wanna go to extrememachines.com,

31:24.580 --> 31:26.020
spelled just how it sounds,

31:26.020 --> 31:28.340
and enter the coupon code MIDDLEST.

31:29.540 --> 31:30.420
What'll that save you?

31:31.060 --> 31:32.980
What that's gonna save you is 20%.

31:33.940 --> 31:34.660
That's a fifth.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.060
That's a fifth or a fourth.

31:37.060 --> 31:37.700
That's a fifth.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.100
We'll call it a fifth.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.860
Let's call it an even fifth.

31:41.860 --> 31:42.900
Well, you can call it that

31:42.900 --> 31:45.060
because math arithmetic fucking says

31:45.060 --> 31:46.820
that that's what the number is.

31:46.820 --> 31:47.540
I agree to disagree.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.380
Let's decide that it's a fifth.

31:49.380 --> 31:52.580
Let's say a fifth for now and then we'll revisit.

31:52.580 --> 31:55.620
extrememachines.com, coupon code MIDDLEST.

31:55.620 --> 31:59.380
At some sex shops, when they sell you a Dilbo

31:59.380 --> 32:01.220
at four fifths of the price,

32:01.220 --> 32:03.860
they'll chop off the tip of the Dilbo

32:03.860 --> 32:05.700
and send you four fifths of the Dilbo.

32:05.700 --> 32:08.420
The extremist trains will not short you like that.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.180
You get the whole hog.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.300
That's their motto.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.780
Come to Extremist Trains and get the whole hog.

32:15.220 --> 32:18.660
But the hog in this case is like a fake cock.

32:18.660 --> 32:21.940
It's like a hog.

32:21.940 --> 32:22.660
It's like a hog.

32:22.660 --> 32:25.540
Yeah, I guess I didn't need to be any more explicit than that.

32:25.540 --> 32:26.980
Sure, yeah, I think it's covered.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.460
This Christmas will be the first I've had

32:29.460 --> 32:33.300
while being in a long-term romantic relationship.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.900
And my girlfriend for sure expects me

32:34.900 --> 32:35.860
to get her something nice.

32:37.140 --> 32:39.060
The problem is I'm a minimalist.

32:39.060 --> 32:42.500
And in my lifestyle, I'm a mental mentalist.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.820
I am so opposed.

32:44.820 --> 32:45.620
I'm a mentalist.

32:45.620 --> 32:49.060
I'm so opposed to non-materialism that I cannot say it.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.260
This Christmas will be the first that I've had

32:52.260 --> 32:54.580
while being in a long-term romantic relationship.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.980
And my girlfriend for sure expects me

32:56.980 --> 32:58.260
to get her something nice.

32:58.260 --> 33:01.140
The problem is I'm a minimalist in my lifestyle.

33:01.140 --> 33:04.500
And as such, I have a really terrible, terrible time

33:04.500 --> 33:06.500
picking out things to give people.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.660
I'm just as bad at selecting gifts all around.

33:08.660 --> 33:11.140
It occurred to me, however, that my girlfriend

33:11.140 --> 33:12.820
and a close female friend of mine,

33:12.820 --> 33:15.620
who full disclosure, I previously had

33:15.620 --> 33:17.540
a pseudo romantic relationship with,

33:17.540 --> 33:20.180
have similar taste in fashion accessories and stuff.

33:20.180 --> 33:22.500
And that if I got her to help me pick something out,

33:23.060 --> 33:25.620
it would for sure be a hit with my girlfriend.

33:25.620 --> 33:29.140
I just can't decide if this idea is brilliant and practical,

33:29.140 --> 33:33.940
solution of my gift giving woes, or the worst idea ever.

33:33.940 --> 33:37.140
That's from Gift Blind Guy in Minneapolis.

33:38.020 --> 33:39.460
Oh, it's the worst idea ever.

33:39.460 --> 33:41.780
Hey, Gift Blind Guy, if you want to get back together

33:41.780 --> 33:44.660
with the first girl you dated, just do it, okay?

33:44.660 --> 33:47.380
Please don't make me watch you at JCPenney

33:47.380 --> 33:49.460
as you go through the scarves, okay?

33:49.460 --> 33:50.020
Thank you.

33:50.020 --> 33:53.860
Um, I mean, it depends entirely on what the relationship is.

33:53.860 --> 33:56.260
I mean, it depends entirely on what the relationship is

33:56.260 --> 33:58.660
between the two women.

33:58.660 --> 34:01.700
Because if your girlfriend is not comfortable

34:01.700 --> 34:04.900
with you hanging out this former beau of yours,

34:05.620 --> 34:07.700
then I don't think she would be cool with like,

34:07.700 --> 34:09.700
oh, these are so great slacks.

34:09.700 --> 34:10.580
I love these slacks.

34:10.580 --> 34:11.540
Where'd you get these slacks?

34:11.540 --> 34:13.700
And you say, JCPenney, and you say, how much do they cost?

34:13.700 --> 34:15.620
And you say, well, don't ask me a question about that.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.060
Like, that is a gift.

34:17.060 --> 34:18.420
And say, oh, well, how did you know

34:18.420 --> 34:19.940
how I would like these slacks?

34:19.940 --> 34:23.300
And then you say, oh, oh, Large Marge told me.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.700
Why did I, I am so fucking bad at thinking in names

34:25.700 --> 34:27.060
whenever I tell anecdotes.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.180
Let's roll with Large Marge.

34:30.180 --> 34:32.820
So your friend, Large Marge, helps you to pick this out.

34:33.380 --> 34:38.020
If she, if current, current special someone

34:39.300 --> 34:41.780
does not know about your relationship with Large Marge.

34:41.780 --> 34:42.260
Small Marge.

34:42.260 --> 34:43.620
It's Small Marge.

34:43.620 --> 34:46.100
If New Marge doesn't know about Large Marge,

34:46.980 --> 34:48.580
then you are fine.

34:48.580 --> 34:49.780
Here are some key notes.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.580
I don't care what the relationship is.

34:52.580 --> 34:56.260
No one wants to hear that they needed someone

34:56.260 --> 34:58.740
of the opposite sex to help them pick a gift

34:58.740 --> 35:00.820
because they know you that little.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.380
Like, that's not, that's going to sully the present.

35:03.380 --> 35:05.140
They must never know, okay?

35:05.140 --> 35:06.020
That's number one.

35:06.740 --> 35:08.900
No reason, no reason.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.260
I don't think there's any reason to be bad

35:10.260 --> 35:11.380
at buying people gifts.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.620
Because that just means that you don't know what they like.

35:13.620 --> 35:16.740
Like, yeah, this is the problem is that when you say

35:16.740 --> 35:18.900
that she wants something nice and you're a minimalist

35:18.900 --> 35:21.220
and blah, blah, blah, you're missing the point.

35:21.220 --> 35:25.620
The point is not how expensive or how big

35:25.620 --> 35:27.780
or how great the present is.

35:27.780 --> 35:31.780
It's that when, my feelings on gift giving

35:31.780 --> 35:34.180
is that when the person opens the present

35:34.180 --> 35:35.860
and sees it for the first time,

35:35.860 --> 35:38.340
they should know instantly why you thought

35:38.340 --> 35:39.140
they would like it.

35:39.780 --> 35:40.100
Right.

35:40.100 --> 35:41.460
Whether they actually do or not,

35:41.460 --> 35:43.060
they should be able to think, okay, well,

35:43.060 --> 35:44.980
he knows that I like this movie

35:44.980 --> 35:47.540
and this is a piece of memorabilia from that.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.700
Or he knows that my favorite color is blue

35:49.700 --> 35:51.300
and so he bought me this blue shirt.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.860
I come at it more from a shock and awe angle

35:53.860 --> 35:55.700
where like, holy shit, I can't believe this person

35:55.700 --> 35:56.980
spent this much money on me.

35:57.620 --> 35:59.220
I'm just saying your advice makes you really sound

35:59.220 --> 36:01.540
like one of the 47%, but go on.

36:02.980 --> 36:04.980
It sounds like poor people advice.

36:04.980 --> 36:06.180
You're poor mouthing right now.

36:07.220 --> 36:10.100
Well, do you, okay, so gift line,

36:10.100 --> 36:11.940
do you want me to solve this for you?

36:12.500 --> 36:12.820
Do it.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.660
And it's a little tweak,

36:14.660 --> 36:17.140
but just don't have the person go with you.

36:17.140 --> 36:19.460
Ask them beforehand, ask Large Marge, say,

36:19.460 --> 36:21.860
hey, I'm trying to think of things

36:21.860 --> 36:24.100
to get my girlfriend this Christmas.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.540
Do you have any suggestions?

36:26.100 --> 36:27.220
And then you don't have to say

36:27.220 --> 36:28.580
that someone helped you pick it out.

36:28.580 --> 36:29.940
Well, except that she did.

36:30.900 --> 36:32.660
No, I do that all the time.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.460
If like, and I never, you know, go on that solely,

36:35.460 --> 36:37.460
but I'll pull some friends and say,

36:37.460 --> 36:39.140
I'm thinking about getting Teresa this.

36:39.140 --> 36:40.260
What do you think?

36:40.260 --> 36:40.900
You know what I mean?

36:40.900 --> 36:44.660
Like, there's no shame in asking the audience.

36:44.660 --> 36:44.900
Yeah.

36:44.900 --> 36:45.540
You know what I mean?

36:45.540 --> 36:48.580
So you don't have to go in it alone,

36:48.580 --> 36:51.460
but maybe don't make the person such an intrinsic part

36:51.460 --> 36:52.900
of picking out the gift

36:52.900 --> 36:54.740
that you've got to give them credit for it.

36:55.460 --> 36:56.260
How about this?

36:56.820 --> 36:59.300
Let's buy her some lotion, you goofster.

37:01.460 --> 37:02.820
Is this a surefire hit?

37:03.780 --> 37:04.740
What flavor?

37:05.540 --> 37:09.220
You know, fucking pecans or vanilla or something food,

37:09.220 --> 37:11.140
like some sort of dessert flavor.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.420
Or just get her some food.

37:12.420 --> 37:13.700
See, that's classic.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.220
That's how Large Marge thought.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.540
Large Marge wanted everything to smell like food.

37:17.540 --> 37:21.460
So of course she's going to get you like barbecue sauce lotion,

37:22.420 --> 37:25.300
but that's not what New Marge likes.

37:26.180 --> 37:27.460
New Marge likes baubles.

37:28.020 --> 37:28.260
Yeah.

37:29.460 --> 37:32.420
Maybe, maybe get her a date at the spa.

37:32.420 --> 37:33.860
I bet, who wouldn't like that?

37:34.500 --> 37:37.460
Maybe get her some bath salts, actual bath salts or the drug.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.060
Yeah, just get her the drug.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.220
Have you guys noticed,

37:41.220 --> 37:44.660
and I don't know if it is this way at your personal malls,

37:44.660 --> 37:49.700
but have you noticed that like after November 1,

37:50.260 --> 37:53.540
the Bath and Body Works is just untenable.

37:53.540 --> 37:53.860
Yeah.

37:53.860 --> 37:55.700
You cannot enter that.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.380
It is a throng of humanity.

37:57.380 --> 38:05.940
It is Black Friday in that particular kiosk all month long.

38:05.940 --> 38:06.260
Yeah.

38:06.260 --> 38:11.540
And the smell, the smell manifests into a very physical presence.

38:11.540 --> 38:15.060
It's a visible smell coming out of that place.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.820
You will see like a smell ghost,

38:16.820 --> 38:19.540
like wafting out of the front door saying coming in.

38:19.540 --> 38:22.340
It's like somebody baked all of the different cookies

38:22.340 --> 38:23.620
that there are in the world

38:23.620 --> 38:25.940
and then covered them in rose petals

38:25.940 --> 38:28.340
and then buried them in the ground for 2000 years

38:28.340 --> 38:31.940
and then dug that up and then injected it straight into the nostrils.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.100
When the like whiff of smell comes out

38:34.100 --> 38:37.620
and like entices the hobo to like come to the pie in the window.

38:37.620 --> 38:38.020
Yeah.

38:38.020 --> 38:41.860
It's like that only with sons and husbands

38:41.860 --> 38:44.100
who don't know what their wives or moms like.

38:44.100 --> 38:44.340
Yeah.

38:44.340 --> 38:45.620
Going into Bath and Body Works

38:45.620 --> 38:47.060
to get a gift for your significant other

38:47.060 --> 38:49.540
is basically just like giving up.

38:49.540 --> 38:50.500
Just like, I don't know.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.820
I guess they like to smell good and be soft.

38:52.820 --> 38:53.060
Fuck.

38:54.100 --> 38:54.420
Shit.

38:55.780 --> 38:57.380
Smell beautiful for me, Deborah.

38:58.100 --> 39:00.340
It is also like the quintessential like,

39:00.900 --> 39:03.940
you know, white elephant, you know, secret Santa present.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.860
I'm like, I know nothing about this person

39:05.860 --> 39:07.700
except that they don't like to stink.

39:07.700 --> 39:13.300
I just don't like the idea of getting somebody a gift

39:13.300 --> 39:14.020
that basically says,

39:14.020 --> 39:16.500
I want you to smell better for like two weeks

39:16.500 --> 39:17.780
and then this is going to be gone.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.780
Enjoy this for less than a month.

39:19.780 --> 39:22.180
Can we also say that there's something skeezy about saying,

39:22.180 --> 39:25.060
I got you a gift and I want you to rub it all over your body.

39:25.060 --> 39:26.740
Rub this on your body.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.660
I've gotten several grandmothers lotion from Bath and Body Works

39:32.660 --> 39:35.460
and that thought didn't really cross my mind.

39:35.460 --> 39:39.220
It was more like, this is just twisted peppermint.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.140
Rub it all over your body.

39:41.140 --> 39:42.260
No, it was more like,

39:43.300 --> 39:46.660
I got a vanilla, Vanilla Bean Noel.

39:47.300 --> 39:49.220
Take this Vanilla Bean Noel.

39:49.780 --> 39:51.940
Rub it all over your ashy elbows.

39:51.940 --> 39:54.980
Mine was more like, oh, meeps, meeps, meeps.

39:55.540 --> 39:57.860
I know that your hands get all crackly

39:57.860 --> 39:59.700
when you play computer pachinko.

40:00.260 --> 40:03.140
So why don't you rub this sweet, sweet peppermint all over.

40:03.140 --> 40:04.820
I'll take care of that crackly problem.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.820
You can play pachinko uninterrupted.

40:07.860 --> 40:14.500
It's very, it's very, very dry in your assisted living housing.

40:14.500 --> 40:19.780
Maybe put some pink sugar plum onto those crackle knuckles.

40:19.780 --> 40:23.940
Oh, meepers, it's dry, dry work, writing in all caps on my Facebook wall.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.300
You know you got to lube them up.

40:28.420 --> 40:33.540
Lube those, lube those joints up so you can keep clicking and sharing.

40:33.540 --> 40:37.780
As to how the jazz musician made his way into our conversation about lotion.

40:39.780 --> 40:41.620
Jazz musician has a grandma too.

40:43.460 --> 40:44.900
I'm jazz granny.

40:44.900 --> 40:48.900
I'm Lou Reed and I'm going to rub stuff all over all your grandmas.

40:48.900 --> 40:52.660
I'm going to put a little soul in a bowl.

40:52.660 --> 40:55.300
We're going to rub stuff, wait, wait.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.620
Did you say Lou Reed or Lou Ross?

40:57.620 --> 40:59.460
I said both of them.

40:59.460 --> 41:01.780
Both of them have grandmothers after all.

41:01.780 --> 41:04.180
We all have grandmothers, don't we folks?

41:04.180 --> 41:06.900
Lou Ross is going to tag team your grandma's elbows.

41:06.900 --> 41:10.180
I used to like this show, my brother, my brother, me,

41:10.180 --> 41:13.780
and then every episode devolved into them low talking

41:13.780 --> 41:17.540
and try to say the most upsetting things they could think of to each other.

41:20.100 --> 41:21.460
Vanilla bean Noel, folks.

41:21.460 --> 41:24.020
That's the scent to watch, in my opinion.

41:24.820 --> 41:27.300
I'm keeping track of all the scent stock markets.

41:27.300 --> 41:30.660
I have invested heavily in pink sugar plum.

41:31.540 --> 41:33.700
Yankee Candle has got it popping off.

41:33.700 --> 41:37.700
They've got some apple and pine needle.

41:37.700 --> 41:39.780
Ooh, that smells great.

41:39.780 --> 41:41.220
That sounds delightful.

41:41.220 --> 41:47.060
So I've dropped about 10 large on one that's just called buttholes.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.540
They sell it only on extreme restraints.

41:52.420 --> 41:55.780
Some people just can't get enough of that funky stuff.

41:55.780 --> 41:56.740
That funky stuff.

41:59.140 --> 42:00.180
This isn't funky.

42:02.660 --> 42:03.860
Funky is a terrible word.

42:07.060 --> 42:11.060
Now at Yankee Candle, they now have scents for men.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.020
Pumpkin pie is not a scent for it.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.460
They're all scents for men.

42:17.460 --> 42:23.300
No, I'm talking about there is a smell like, for example, of

42:23.300 --> 42:26.580
fresh pussy.

42:29.620 --> 42:32.180
Like the smell of freshly cut wood.

42:32.180 --> 42:36.820
The smell of carpentry, basically, is a smell you can get at Yankee Candle.

42:37.540 --> 42:42.180
I want to know how you play that off to your bros when they're like,

42:42.180 --> 42:44.660
hey, bro, have you been cutting the cabinet?

42:44.660 --> 42:46.740
Are you building something with your own hands?

42:46.740 --> 42:48.260
Like, well, almost.

42:48.260 --> 42:50.740
I lit a candle that smelled like I did.

42:50.740 --> 42:51.940
Are we good?

42:51.940 --> 42:53.860
Am I good right now?

42:53.860 --> 42:54.420
Am I good?

42:55.300 --> 42:56.660
I'm sorry, Yankee Candle.

42:56.660 --> 43:01.700
I usually like you, but I do not live in a world in which I light a pumpkin spice candle

43:01.700 --> 43:04.980
and some bros walk in the room and say, oh, are you burning a candle like a lady?

43:05.780 --> 43:07.140
I've never heard that before.

43:07.140 --> 43:10.580
You light a cut wood candle and your girlfriend comes home and is like,

43:10.580 --> 43:12.260
what the fuck is this shit?

43:12.820 --> 43:14.100
I hate this smell.

43:15.140 --> 43:16.420
Oh, it's like poison.

43:17.060 --> 43:18.660
And now I can't smell.

43:18.660 --> 43:25.380
Well, there is an actual, no bullshit, Yankee Candle that is called,

43:25.380 --> 43:28.740
and I kid you not, Man Town.

43:29.780 --> 43:31.140
That is a candle.

43:31.140 --> 43:33.300
You could go to Yankee Candle and say,

43:33.300 --> 43:38.020
I tell you where I want this scent to transport me to, Man Town.

43:38.020 --> 43:42.420
Which is also the follow up hit to The Weather Girl's It's Raining Men.

43:42.420 --> 43:51.940
About this fragrance, escape to the man cave with this masculine blend of spices, woods and musk.

43:51.940 --> 43:54.020
Oh my God.

43:54.020 --> 43:56.660
Is there a word worse than musk?

43:56.660 --> 44:01.780
That's been the problem with men exclusive rooms all these years

44:01.780 --> 44:04.580
is that they haven't smelled enough like dudes.

44:05.220 --> 44:06.500
No, wait a minute.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.580
I got that completely backwards.

44:08.580 --> 44:12.260
No one ever walks into your quote unquote man cave.

44:12.260 --> 44:13.860
First off, gross.

44:13.860 --> 44:17.220
Second, no one ever walks into your man cave and says,

44:17.220 --> 44:21.060
man, I tell you what it could smell more like in here right now, dude.

44:21.060 --> 44:24.180
Or better yet, I fucking love this smell,

44:24.180 --> 44:27.940
but it's so hard to get bros together, drink beer, eat corn nuts,

44:27.940 --> 44:29.700
and watch football all the time.

44:29.700 --> 44:32.180
I wish I could wake up to this scent.

44:33.220 --> 44:36.820
I just wish that there was some way that I could just take myself to Man Town.

44:36.820 --> 44:41.140
I tell you, I tell you, Philippe,

44:41.140 --> 44:47.220
it really, really smells like you've had a bunch of dudes in here hanging out and broing.

44:47.220 --> 44:49.140
It smells like that, doesn't it?

44:49.140 --> 44:52.100
It's pretty much just been me, me and my candles.

44:52.100 --> 44:57.220
We had a pretty heavy bro sesh last week and the musk is still hanging in the,

44:57.220 --> 44:58.580
it's in the wallpaper.

44:58.580 --> 45:00.260
That stank ain't never coming out.

45:01.380 --> 45:04.980
Well now it won't because I just don't know what,

45:04.980 --> 45:07.460
but if you light a candle-

45:07.460 --> 45:08.180
What market?

45:08.820 --> 45:10.100
Yeah, what's the market?

45:10.100 --> 45:15.700
If I light a candle, the use is almost always to get rid of a smell that a man created.

45:16.260 --> 45:20.500
It is almost always from like, ah, Greg, you left your fish out again.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.340
Guys, I know what the market is.

45:22.340 --> 45:22.740
Tell me.

45:24.020 --> 45:24.900
Army wives.

45:26.660 --> 45:30.420
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

45:31.860 --> 45:32.820
How could this be?

45:32.820 --> 45:34.500
How could this happen?

45:35.620 --> 45:44.180
130 episodes without picking on America's most deserving demographic, army wives.

45:44.180 --> 45:46.660
They've had it easy for too long.

45:46.660 --> 45:49.700
Here comes my brother, my brother and me to knock that proverbial-

45:49.700 --> 45:51.140
Calm, calm, calm.

45:51.140 --> 45:52.260
We're gonna bully you.

45:58.100 --> 45:58.740
Here we are.

45:58.740 --> 46:00.100
Can we end the show?

46:00.100 --> 46:01.140
I feel terrible.

46:01.140 --> 46:03.060
Yeah, that's the end.

46:03.060 --> 46:05.780
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's the end of the show.

46:05.780 --> 46:06.500
Absolutely.

46:08.420 --> 46:11.700
I don't really know if we've really given it to army wives enough.

46:12.980 --> 46:16.660
I think we even, we cracked open the door and it was enough.

46:16.660 --> 46:19.940
They're getting, listen, listen, army wives, you're unnoticed.

46:21.940 --> 46:26.340
We don't have any good goose for you this week, but next week, oh boy.

46:26.340 --> 46:29.220
You're getting off easy, easy right now, but-

46:29.220 --> 46:31.220
You're finally gonna get yours next week.

46:32.020 --> 46:33.220
You'll get your comeuppance.

46:34.020 --> 46:35.700
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

46:35.700 --> 46:36.660
It's an advice show.

46:38.100 --> 46:42.340
Thank you so much for listening, for whatever reason you do do that.

46:43.460 --> 46:47.060
Thank you for tweeting about the show with the MBMBAM hashtag.

46:48.100 --> 46:52.820
Metrixer, Amy El Russo, Little Socrates, Crystal Whalen, of course.

46:52.820 --> 47:02.900
Mason VD, Alphagetti, I believe, James Leff from Miss Dapper, DJ Pazazz, everybody.

47:02.900 --> 47:04.100
We really appreciate it.

47:04.100 --> 47:05.060
The Thunder Boss.

47:06.820 --> 47:12.820
Also, I wanna throw out, Christian is heading out to basic training, I think this week,

47:12.820 --> 47:16.340
and he's looking forward to two months of my brother, my brother, and me waiting for him

47:16.340 --> 47:17.060
when he gets back.

47:17.060 --> 47:20.180
So Christian, have a good time, I guess.

47:20.180 --> 47:20.740
Thank you.

47:20.740 --> 47:21.300
Get training.

47:21.300 --> 47:23.700
Get trained up, basically.

47:23.700 --> 47:28.260
Thank you for your service, and apologies for that sweet transition.

47:30.340 --> 47:34.020
Travis Engineer, sorry to your wife if that's a thing.

47:34.740 --> 47:37.540
I wanna thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

47:37.540 --> 47:39.940
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.500
A great Candle Nights present, I'm sure.

47:43.620 --> 47:47.300
I'm sure everybody who listens to this show already owns that album, but maybe your friends

47:47.300 --> 47:48.820
don't, maybe your parents don't.

47:48.820 --> 47:50.260
Your parents are gonna love these sounds.

47:50.260 --> 47:55.060
He's got a real Peter Gabriel thing going for him that your rinse are just gonna enjoy.

47:58.580 --> 48:00.420
Travis, do you have anything you wanna say?

48:01.540 --> 48:02.420
I actually do.

48:02.420 --> 48:06.100
I realized going through the questions this week, we get a lot of questions every week,

48:06.100 --> 48:10.980
and we can only answer usually three or four or two for not really paying attention.

48:12.340 --> 48:18.580
I just wanted you guys to know, I do read every email that you guys send, and I just

48:18.580 --> 48:23.060
wanna say, I love all of you so much, and I'm sorry that we can't get to all your questions

48:23.060 --> 48:27.540
every week, but just know that I do read and I do care, and I know that some of you are

48:27.540 --> 48:32.100
going through some pretty tough stuff, and just know that we're here and we're pulling

48:32.100 --> 48:35.460
for you no matter who you are or what problems you're going through.

48:35.460 --> 48:36.660
We care about you.

48:36.660 --> 48:38.100
So there, we love you.

48:38.100 --> 48:38.820
There, I said it.

48:38.820 --> 48:40.260
There, the truth's out.

48:40.260 --> 48:44.660
Take a load off, Andy, and put that load right on me, but not in like a sex way.

48:45.380 --> 48:46.340
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

48:47.220 --> 48:47.700
Yeah.

48:47.700 --> 48:49.860
This final Yahoo was sent in by Frederick Olson.

48:49.860 --> 48:51.060
Thank you, Frederick.

48:51.060 --> 48:57.380
It's by Yahoo answer user Hunita, who asks, what kind of juice is good?

49:01.060 --> 49:02.340
I'm Justin McElroy.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.460
I'm Travis McElroy.

49:03.460 --> 49:04.580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

49:04.580 --> 49:06.100
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

49:06.100 --> 49:06.820
Kiss your dad.

49:06.820 --> 49:20.580
Square on the lips.
