00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:33.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around.

00:33.000 --> 00:44.000
If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
Every day is a gift, and on this particular Monday, you've opened up the gift, and what have you found inside? Ah yes, it's wisdom.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
It's my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I didn't want wisdom, I wanted bop it.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
I got you bop it on the two day delivery that will be here tomorrow.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
You always say that, I never believe you.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
No, bop it will be.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
You always say bop it, and it never comes.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
I got you bop it and a p touch labeler, and you're ruining Christmas right now.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
And I don't want that bullshit bop it with the extra shit like flick it and spin it.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I want the original twist pull and bop.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I only need the three commands, you know what I'm saying?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
That was my bad.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
I got you mop it, which was a different game altogether and much more unpleasant.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, don't try and sneak chores in there, because I'm cognizant.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
You're pretty savvy about that. How did you get so savvy, Griffin?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, by listening to advice shows like ours.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
But not like ours, just ours.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Just by listening to our show.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Exactly ours.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Just ours, it's a list of one, and it's this one.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Let's make another one so someone else can avoid chores.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Cool.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
My name is Justin McElroy, by the way. I'm the oldest McElroy brother.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm Travis McElroy, and I am the middlest McElroy brother.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm Griffin McElroy, and I'm the youngest McElroy brother,

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
now that Tony, who was younger than me, totally died.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Stupid Tony. It's a tractor.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I fucking hated that guy.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I hate Tony.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Bye, Tony McElroy. You are not missed.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Mr. Link.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
I'm glad you're dead.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm glad you're dead.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Stupid.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
He's the one who broke my original bop it.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Fucking douchebag.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
That's why you killed him, with a tractor.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Bye, Tony.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
I want to get my wife a great gift, but it's too expensive for me right now.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Should I tell her what it is to show my intention, and hopefully she appreciates it?

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Chancing the loss of surprise if I were to eventually obtain said funds?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Mr. Lingo. Gmail. Wait a minute.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Is he saying, baby, Merry Christmas.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
For Christmas, I got you the idea of a car.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Is that what he's saying?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I got you this laser-printed off-copy of a car picture.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
That's not a good idea.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
The promise of a Prius.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
It's a Prius promise.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
That is right, right?

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
He picked out a gift, something he knows she would enjoy, but something he will not be purchasing.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Is that what we're at?

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
Because he lacks the fungible assets required to acquire said automobile, or whatever the thing is.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It may not be a car.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm assuming it is, though, because that's the greatest gift of all.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Transportation.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Specifically a Prius.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Mr. Lingo, I'd say don't do that.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Don't, like, wow, don't do that.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
People appreciate the thought, definitely.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
It is the thought that counts, but you cannot have just the thought and then give it up.

03:52.000 --> 04:02.000
This is, I mean, this is why credit cards and irresponsible bank loans were invented, right?

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
So that you could impress your wife and make her think that you have more money than you actually have.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Right.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
And then you just get buried beneath a giant mountain of debt.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Come get out of the debt mountain with me.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Come plant a flag at the, well, it wouldn't be the top, because that would mean you conquered the debt.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
You're deep inside it.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
You're deep, deep in it.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
You're like a mull man.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
You're like a debt mull man.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
You're like James Franco in 127 hours, only, no, you literally have to cut your arm off.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
That's a really good analogy, Griffin.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Nailed it.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
When you ask her if she'll appreciate it, of course she won't.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
You went to absolutely no effort to do it.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I could do that.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I could walk up to anyone in the street and be like, I'm planning on getting you a car.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
You're welcome.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Merry Christmas.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
It doesn't mean anything.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Merry Christmas.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Hey, Justin.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It's just crushing, crushing debt.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Hey, Justin and Travis.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
I wanted to tell you guys, I know it's not, we got like another month before it's Christmas,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
but I just wanted to let you guys know that I got both of you rocket ships.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Whoa.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
For Christmas.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Really?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Real rocket ships, not like toys either.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I'm talking about shits you can use to go into space.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
That's banging.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Thanks, Griff.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Hey, no problem.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Do you have a picture of them or something that I can hold on to?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I can send you one.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I'll Google one at you later.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Will they be here on the 25th, would you say?

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
It may take me a little while to, I've been doing some babysitting gigs on the side trying

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
to save up because the rocket ships are made out of gold.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Oh, shit.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
It adds a little bit to that old MSRP, so I'm going to see what I can do.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
I'll try and make your Christmas wishes come true, but they are high quality rocket ships.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.500
Lingo, we're spending a little time joking around here because we literally cannot overstate

05:57.500 --> 06:01.000
the extent to which you should not do what you're talking about.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I would rather have someone hand me a $5 bill than promise they're going to get me a car

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
in 20 years.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah.

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
I would rather someone hand me a note that says, fuck you, because at least then there's

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
a story.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You won't believe what he did this year.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
I mean, the thing that you're talking about is just sad.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
I don't care if you're broke as broke, broke, broke.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
You could be without money, you could have negative money, and you could still do something

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
that she would appreciate more than that.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
You've got to take it back to the drawing board.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
She would appreciate a coupon for one free back rub before you say, hey, I thought about

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
getting you something nice and I didn't.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
It's not that he didn't.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
He wants to.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
He so desperately wants to.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I don't know, guys.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
I wanted to get you something nice, but I couldn't.

06:57.000 --> 07:05.000
I think I would rather have him, like if I was his beautiful, lovely wife and he offered

07:05.000 --> 07:13.000
me the choice between this pine cone ashtray he made or a Prius in like three months, he's

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
going to hit me up with a Prius in three months.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I think I would rather have the Prius.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
But he shouldn't tell her about it.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
No, because when you spend a lot of money on expensive gifts, what you're doing is buying

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
a surprise.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
You're buying that look of surprise on their face.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Don't ruin that.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I mean, you're definitely going to get a look of surprise if you hand her a sheet of paper

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
that says, I'm going to buy you a car someday.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
She will be surprised.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
It's more going to be hurt, like a hurt look than a happy look.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
It's the opposite of what you want on Christmas Day.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
You should start telling her that you'll never buy her a car.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
If you were hoping I'd get you a car, forget about it.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Give her a piece of paper.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
You've never done anything to deserve a car.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Give her a piece of paper with a picture of a car that says never on it for Christmas.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Then you're getting her a real surprise.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Promise her the car for Christmas and then she'll be real surprised when she doesn't

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
get it.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Surprise, I got you a pine cone ashtray.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Surprise, I'm broke.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Surprise, you could have chosen better.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
It's like that Toyota commercial where the lady opens up her box and inside the box is

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
a giant ribbon like you would find around a car.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Then the husband's like, hey, hey, come look outside.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
She takes a giant ribbon that you would find on a car and she goes outside in the driveway

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
and there's a Prius sitting there.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Only in this situation, she would go outside and there wouldn't be a car.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
He'd be like, where are you going?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
The ribbon is the gift.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
It's a novelty size ribbon for you.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
For you.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Do whatever you want to with it.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
I have another question for us from Gmail.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
No sender on this.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Make sure you tell us who you are when you send these in.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
How do I get my friends to stop referring to things as fire or raw when they are saying

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
something is cool or awesome?

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm only a senior in high school, but I still don't think my friends should be talking like idiots.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
And if you haven't heard these terms before in this way before, then maybe it's just a

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
South Florida thing regardless.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Example.

09:16.000 --> 09:25.000
Yo, this party is going to be so raw and hey, man, you should have seen it last night.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Last night was pure fire.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Dude, I have I have really wicked bad news for you.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
You meant to ask for advice, but what you've done is proliferate these these two catch

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
phrases into your favorite podcast because you better believe I'm going to start saying

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
things are like fire or quite possibly raw every chance I get.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
I think that calling things fire is pretty good.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah, yeah, because it's like, what was better than the invention of fire?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Nothing.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Yep.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yep.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
And raw food.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Raw food is food that you can't touch with fire.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Right.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
So it's like the opposite.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
It's like the antithesis.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
I think these two things, they're using them as synonyms, but I think that they should

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
be used as an Antoine Ems.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Antoine Ems.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
The important thing whenever coming up, whenever you come up with new slang is where do you

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
use it?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Where is it appropriate?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Because I don't think you could say a girl is raw.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I think that that's.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, I don't think you should do that.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I don't think that's OK.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Like an orphanage is so fire.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
That's not OK.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Yo, that's St. Jude's Medical Center.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
It's raw.

10:50.000 --> 11:00.200
I think you can kill new terminology pretty quickly because I think it's so rare that

11:00.200 --> 11:04.920
someone says, hey, that word you're using, it's not working.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.840
I think if you tell your friends like, hey, it's not flying for you.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.360
That's not working for you.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.400
That word, it makes you sound silly.

11:13.400 --> 11:17.440
That kind of direct approach may be the best thing.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.440
Because another idea.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.440
Oh, sorry.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
Go on.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.840
No, because a lot of times words get stuck in your head and you don't know where they

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
came from.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.060
Maybe they came from my brother, my brother, me from an email from a guy from South Florida.

11:28.060 --> 11:33.540
And now you're saying everything's fire and raw shit is so fire.

11:33.540 --> 11:39.240
All you need to do is get his mom to start using them, get your friend's parents to start

11:39.240 --> 11:43.600
using raw and fire and I guarantee they won't use it anymore.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.480
Nailed it.

11:45.480 --> 11:51.520
Can you guys remember any any colloquial terms that you that were popular when you were in

11:51.520 --> 11:55.040
in high school that you, you know, didn't particularly care for?

11:55.040 --> 11:58.320
You mean like stuffies?

11:58.320 --> 11:59.320
What is that?

11:59.320 --> 12:00.320
Like that's good stuffies?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.320
Oh, no.

12:01.320 --> 12:06.560
That can't be a real thing.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.400
Yeah, you guys said it, you assholes.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.840
You got it stuck in my head.

12:11.840 --> 12:12.840
I didn't mean to.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.040
Yeah, I think for me, it was pussy town.

12:16.040 --> 12:21.120
I see something cool be like, Hey, did you go to the play last night?

12:21.120 --> 12:22.120
Yeah, dog.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.920
It was pussy town.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.120
And I think that was that was like elementary school.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.160
It was it was wildly inappropriate.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.920
Yeah, it was not something kids should say.

12:30.920 --> 12:36.360
But you can't control like the spread of language, you know, you can't you you absolutely can't

12:36.360 --> 12:37.680
control it.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.480
We invented language the other way around.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.440
It's because language is so fucking raw.

12:42.440 --> 12:46.920
Oh, my God, it's raw and kind of fire, fire.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.000
It's a little fire, right?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Not on fire.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.320
It just is.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.320
It is fire.

12:52.320 --> 12:58.120
Hey, I have a Yahoo Answers question, please.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.400
This one was sent in by Louis dog.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.300
Thanks, Louis dog.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.040
Oh, shit.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.440
I didn't even look at this before.

13:06.440 --> 13:13.760
It's like four asterisks, and then like a space and then like nine asterisks.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.400
So I'm sure there's a name in there somewhere, but I'm not going to try and decode it.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.980
A bunch of asterisks asks, first bowling date.

13:21.980 --> 13:24.000
What to do?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.240
We're both 14.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.040
And we are going bowling this weekend.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.120
We've already kissed.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.880
And now she tells me that she is not very good at bowling.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.520
What can I do?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.240
What can I do with this information?

13:34.240 --> 13:35.680
Do I just watch her try?

13:35.680 --> 13:39.320
And if it's no good, say, let me help you and then guide her arm?

13:39.320 --> 13:44.960
How can I be romantic and maybe be making out by the end?

13:44.960 --> 13:52.840
To clarify, it is not our first date, just my first bowling date.

13:52.840 --> 13:58.480
If you are caught making out in a bowling alley, you will be ejected.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.760
But you will be high fived.

13:59.760 --> 14:05.480
There will be two lines of people high fiving you on either side as you leave the establishment.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.400
They will all be toothless and terrible and awful people.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.120
Have you guys ever heard of cutting a hole in the bottom of a popcorn bucket?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.760
You could do that with a bowling ball.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.720
It's going to take some flexibility, and it's going to take some dedication, and it's going

14:19.720 --> 14:20.720
to take some butter.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.320
But you are going to do it.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.320
You're going to pull it off.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.320
It will not.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.320
It cannot feel good, though.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.520
It will not be pleasurable.

14:28.520 --> 14:32.440
It will be raw and no, not like you're thinking.

14:32.440 --> 14:37.480
Dig it, dig it deep in there, like stick your prick like right in the back of the bowling

14:37.480 --> 14:40.920
ball, like on the opposite side of the three holes so that when she tucks her three fingers

14:40.920 --> 14:44.800
in there, there's a chance she may graze.

14:44.800 --> 14:51.000
She puts her two fingers and thumb in there, gives you a Minnesota pincher, and you are

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
off to the races.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Oh, man.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.520
But it is so important that she realizes what you've done before she bowls.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.200
Oh, God.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.600
You have got you've got to figure getting into the situation.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.360
If you thought that was hard.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.360
Try getting out of it.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.360
It is.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.360
Wow.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.360
Maybe.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.360
My dick's in the wall.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.360
Yes, Travis.

15:11.360 --> 15:16.360
That's what we were talking about.

15:16.360 --> 15:20.440
No, but Travis does have a good point.

15:20.440 --> 15:25.560
You need to be as clearly spoken as humanly possible.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.840
Very direct.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.000
Because you know, maybe you made the hole too small.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.360
Like maybe there's maybe there's a vacuum issue.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.560
And if that's the case, then then I mean, you're going to have to make an embarrassing

15:37.560 --> 15:42.440
trip to the emergency room, which maybe this tip is not a good idea for a first bowling

15:42.440 --> 15:43.440
date.

15:43.440 --> 15:48.240
I always say if you're going to stick your dick in a bowling ball to try and get a Minnesota

15:48.240 --> 15:51.760
pincher, you've got to wait until at least bowling date number three.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.760
Yeah, that's true.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.760
That's true.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.320
It's about class and it's about decorum.

15:56.320 --> 16:00.560
You know, you wouldn't don't do anything you wouldn't do without her parents permission.

16:00.560 --> 16:08.600
So make sure you ask host said if you're going to stick your dick to a bowling ball.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.600
Also don't go on a bowling date.

16:10.600 --> 16:15.400
I can't think of a single time I have ever taken a girl to a bowling alley and had it

16:15.400 --> 16:18.520
not just be a fucking unmitigated night.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.560
Can I tell you something I discovered about bowling girlfriend?

16:20.560 --> 16:21.600
Maybe this will help you out.

16:21.600 --> 16:26.480
I've discovered it over the years there.

16:26.480 --> 16:32.920
The bowling that you grew up with thinking that it was what bowling really was.

16:32.920 --> 16:37.520
It's not actually bowling real bowling is you have to be drunk.

16:37.520 --> 16:43.160
If you are drunk, then bowling finally makes sense because you're just sitting for a long

16:43.160 --> 16:47.720
time and then every once in a while you have reason to stand up and lob something heavy.

16:47.720 --> 16:52.620
Like it's that's that's the whole bit and it makes no sense if you're sober.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.680
But if you've been drinking, yeah, OK, now I get it.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.720
You don't care so much if the ball goes in the gutter.

16:59.720 --> 17:00.720
You can't do that.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.740
Are you playing with a dude who takes it way too seriously and has like a specialized glove

17:04.740 --> 17:09.320
and he kicks his foot out and like he's kind of an asshole and he gets over like 150.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.120
Yeah, no one likes that guy either.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.120
No, I don't like you.

17:12.120 --> 17:13.960
I'd rather be drunk and get 32.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.600
Hey, just don't go.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
Don't go bowling.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.360
And I just say no more bowling, no more.

17:18.360 --> 17:21.240
Can we bring back what's that?

17:21.240 --> 17:25.280
What's that table bowling game where you have like the sand on the table and you have to

17:25.280 --> 17:28.640
it's like shuffleboard, but it's not like on a table jar.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.700
You know, I'm saying skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.600
Let's bring skeet skeet back.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.240
Let's have skeet skeet dates, everybody.

17:35.240 --> 17:41.840
The super serious bowling reminded me, make sure you're really certain which bowling ball

17:41.840 --> 17:46.400
is your girlfriend's, because wow, wow.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.400
That can get weird.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.440
Here's another one from Gmail.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.160
There's a very pretty coworker I have.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.980
We've been working together for almost three years and we get along pretty well.

17:55.980 --> 17:59.520
The other day she did something nice for me and when I said thank you, she said, she just

17:59.520 --> 18:04.240
smirked and quipped, it's okay, you just owe me a beer now.

18:04.240 --> 18:09.160
Should I take this as a hint or the friendly coworker banter that I just assumed it was?

18:09.160 --> 18:13.080
I was never good at picking up hints, so this problem has been nagging at me for a while.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.320
Please keep up the good work, Eli.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.680
Oh, Eli.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.600
What was the nice thing that she did for you?

18:21.600 --> 18:27.200
Was it like she took care of a difficult customer or like she kept a refrigerator from crushing

18:27.200 --> 18:30.200
you to death?

18:30.200 --> 18:33.360
Because if she saved your life, you do owe her a beer.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.240
I mean, that's true.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.240
That is how it works.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.560
Is it that you, did you give, did she give you a beer?

18:40.560 --> 18:42.600
Because if that is the context.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.600
May I borrow a beer, coworker?

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
Well, of course.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.600
Do you have a beer in your desk?

18:46.600 --> 18:48.600
Do you have any desk beer?

18:48.600 --> 18:52.000
No, Eli, that was a, that was a hint.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I think it was.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
It's definitely a hint.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Straight up.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.960
I think, and even if it wasn't, fuck it, like go out and buy her a beer.

18:58.960 --> 19:05.440
And if it's, if it wasn't like a, like a sexy, hey, let's find out type of thing, then you

19:05.440 --> 19:07.000
guys will become closer friends.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.800
That's a, that's a win-win.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.040
That's a win-win in my book.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.280
Listen, Eli, it really sounds like this girl is purifier.

19:13.280 --> 19:18.360
So it's important, just, you don't need hints.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.260
Everybody thinks there's, you don't need hints.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.640
Go out on a limb, ask the girl out.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.620
If you're waiting for her to indicate to you that she's ready to be asked out, that's not

19:26.620 --> 19:27.620
how that works.

19:27.620 --> 19:30.120
Hi, it's time to ask me out now.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.120
Yeah.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.480
Hint, ask me out.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.540
Don't ask her out.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.020
Not in the traditional sense.

19:35.020 --> 19:36.920
Don't say, hey, would you like to go on a date?

19:36.920 --> 19:40.120
Just say, hey, you know, how about, how about I buy you that beer?

19:40.120 --> 19:41.640
Ah, see, this is troubling.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.340
This is where we get into problems.

19:43.340 --> 19:47.940
His next step is completely dependent on how long it's been since this happened.

19:47.940 --> 19:51.080
Because if you bring up something that happened three weeks ago, it's not going to be cute.

19:51.080 --> 19:55.860
Hey, do you remember, do you remember, uh, you had, you had that purple scrunchie in

19:55.860 --> 20:02.720
your hair and it's, it's, you smelled like lilacs and you, you asked for a beer and it's

20:02.720 --> 20:07.760
time for me to get, I want to give you that beer, instantly become Crispin Glover.

20:07.760 --> 20:15.960
Yeah, uh, you, if it's been a while, what you need to do is trick her, uh, do something

20:15.960 --> 20:20.740
nice for her and then say, I guess we owe each other a beer now and then say, let's

20:20.740 --> 20:25.400
go have those beers, unless, and then you'll find out because she'll say, if it's not like

20:25.400 --> 20:29.420
a hint, then she'll say, well, no, now we're even.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.000
So let's never talk again.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.760
That seems like a pretty good decider.

20:34.760 --> 20:39.280
Have you considered, maybe she's not dropping a hint and maybe she's just like a raging

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
alcoholic.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.280
She loves beer.

20:41.280 --> 20:47.200
Like maybe she, and not just that, but like she does nice things for, for just everyone.

20:47.200 --> 20:53.240
Um, and then like remarks, Hey, you, you do now owe me a beer.

20:53.240 --> 20:57.820
Like Hey, don't worry, I'll press the, the crossing signal for you, but you do owe me

20:57.820 --> 20:58.820
a Heineken.

20:58.820 --> 20:59.820
The sooner the better.

20:59.820 --> 21:05.280
Like right now, as soon as I got the shivers, if you could just like beer me, give me a

21:05.280 --> 21:07.680
beer, beer me, bro.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.160
Do you see her getting handed beers?

21:09.160 --> 21:10.160
A lot of work.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.220
Do people come to her with beers?

21:13.220 --> 21:16.840
She could just, I know my service was, was really great, but, um, don't worry about the

21:16.840 --> 21:17.840
tip.

21:17.840 --> 21:21.180
If you could, there is a TGI Fridays next door.

21:21.180 --> 21:26.860
If you could pick me up a, just like a tall boy of a whatever brew they have on tap today

21:26.860 --> 21:31.500
and just, you know, slide it down this away, uh, we will be square.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.920
We will be even up, but there is one thing you want to watch out for.

21:34.920 --> 21:39.720
If you are a guy who is bad at picking up hints, if you do the like, Hey coworker, let's

21:39.720 --> 21:42.800
go grab a drink and she's like, all right, great.

21:42.800 --> 21:47.320
You have established nothing because you didn't ask her out.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.940
You, there was no romance involved.

21:49.940 --> 21:53.440
You have no guarantee that this is quote a date.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.160
I have to keep figuring out as the night goes.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.160
Yeah.

21:57.160 --> 22:01.640
You've got to pretend we're on your shoulder and we're telling you like, that was a hint.

22:01.640 --> 22:02.640
Yeah.

22:02.640 --> 22:03.640
Go with it.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.000
Remember when she took her boob out?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
That was a hint.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Go with it.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.160
I think I disagree with you wholeheartedly.

22:10.160 --> 22:14.480
I think it's got to start off like, Hey coworker, let's go hang out and the romance will blossom.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.480
No, no, no.

22:15.480 --> 22:19.520
Travis is saying, he isn't saying that he needs to push it into date land.

22:19.520 --> 22:26.880
What he's saying is that it's going to be tough navigating those waters if he's not

22:26.880 --> 22:27.880
got his eyes open.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.880
Yeah.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.440
Is this like a person you've hung out with for three years and now you're hanging out

22:32.440 --> 22:36.020
outside of work or is this like beginning of a thing?

22:36.020 --> 22:37.200
Let's see where this goes.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.880
So you need to just kind of like Justin said, navigate.

22:40.880 --> 22:45.520
You're going to come up to all these, choose your own adventure spots and you need to make

22:45.520 --> 22:47.320
all the right moves.

22:47.320 --> 22:54.360
Eli, you, I'd like to, to, to suggest to you that you change your outlook today, today,

22:54.360 --> 22:58.280
this Monday that you're listening to this, you need to change your outlook.

22:58.280 --> 23:02.400
You need to start telling yourself that everything is a hint.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.400
Everything's an opportunity.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.400
Not a closed door.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
It's an open door.

23:05.400 --> 23:09.360
And I say you start walking through those open doors and you, and if you're wrong about

23:09.360 --> 23:13.280
it, you get your heart broken a few times and you get so tough that you won't even notice

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
anymore.

23:14.280 --> 23:18.880
But if you're right about it, you get that glorious opportunity that you would have missed

23:18.880 --> 23:22.160
if you had been afraid that something wasn't a hint.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.160
Everything's a hint, Eli.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.760
Start walking through those open doors.

23:25.760 --> 23:29.760
Do people ever purchase products from the peanut enlargement emails?

23:29.760 --> 23:31.560
Penis enlargement emails.

23:31.560 --> 23:32.560
What is a peanut?

23:32.560 --> 23:35.760
I'm allergic to peanuts.

23:35.760 --> 23:39.760
It's what you have before you buy a penis enlargement product.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.560
What are the chances of them working?

23:41.560 --> 23:42.560
Thanks.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.560
It's a glorious form spring.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.560
100%.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.280
100% effective every time.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.280
How could they not?

23:48.280 --> 23:49.760
They sell them on the internet.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.920
Think about it.

23:50.920 --> 23:54.720
That's just math.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.280
If you got a tiny wiener, no one will ever love you.

23:58.280 --> 24:02.480
If you take pills you bought off the internet, you've got a chance at love.

24:02.480 --> 24:06.360
Just hang some weights from your dong so it's just stretched out.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.360
Yeah, sure.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.840
Yeah, dong weights, but make sure you buy them off the internet.

24:10.840 --> 24:20.760
Everything you do regarding your peanut, it's so important that you only consult the internet.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.760
Doctors aren't going to help you out.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.000
They're just going to look at your little prick and they're going to laugh at you.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.440
They're going to laugh at you, smack it around with the back of their hand.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.440
They're going to giggle.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.520
They're going to flick it with their pinky finger.

24:30.520 --> 24:34.960
Flick it like one of those springy doorstops, just like that.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.200
You got to go to the...

24:36.200 --> 24:42.360
The internet's too big to care about your little balls and your precious little wiener.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.560
The internet's not going to care.

24:43.560 --> 24:47.320
You got to go and you got to take as many pills as they can throw at you.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.320
Yeah.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.720
Just take all the pills that the internet has and you will not care anymore about your

24:52.720 --> 24:53.720
wiener size.

24:53.720 --> 24:54.720
That's a stone fact.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.400
Griffin, you got a Yahoo for me?

24:57.400 --> 24:58.820
I do.

24:58.820 --> 24:59.820
How about this one?

24:59.820 --> 25:02.120
It was sent in by Patrick Toy.

25:02.120 --> 25:05.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ghimrob.

25:05.480 --> 25:14.520
Yahoo asks, smelly wife, my wife comes home from work and she don't smell good.

25:14.520 --> 25:20.660
I want to do some cuddling and the good stuff while she gets here, but between work and

25:20.660 --> 25:23.920
cooking dinner, she just don't smell good.

25:23.920 --> 25:29.560
How do I get her to clean up her act so I can enjoy some husbandry rewards?

25:29.560 --> 25:36.360
Oh, fuck, you know what this question made me think of is when Justin used to work at

25:36.360 --> 25:42.120
the Olive Garden and he would come home every day smelling like just like six inches deep

25:42.120 --> 25:43.120
inside a butthole.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.120
Like the worst.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.720
He used to call it the OG water that they would coat you in.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.800
You would be bathed in it at the end of the night.

25:50.800 --> 25:56.800
So basically the guy's problem is his wife is busy working and cooking his meals and

25:56.800 --> 26:04.160
as a result, she she doesn't smell pleasant for the another a tertiary for the cuddling

26:04.160 --> 26:07.680
and the good stuff for the cuddling and the good stuff.

26:07.680 --> 26:13.920
You know, I read that and I'm like, in my mind, the cuddling is the good stuff.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.720
God, that's so true.

26:15.720 --> 26:20.980
All that all that all those fringe benefits, they're just they're just they're tacked

26:20.980 --> 26:21.980
on there.

26:21.980 --> 26:26.720
It's all about a good, hard cuddle.

26:26.720 --> 26:31.280
You know, this is something where the direct approach is really it's going to be a feast

26:31.280 --> 26:32.280
or famine.

26:32.280 --> 26:39.340
I mean, yeah, either you're going to solve this problem lickety split or you're going

26:39.340 --> 26:44.760
to tell your wife that she smells too bad to cuddle and you won't have that problem

26:44.760 --> 26:46.720
that exact problem anymore.

26:46.720 --> 26:51.240
No, just just look at her and say, you know, honey, I've been sitting here on the couch

26:51.240 --> 26:54.840
all day watching Maury and waiting for you to get home to cuddle.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.840
You smell like buttholes.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.320
You smell like eight buttholes in a butthole bag.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.320
Get it together.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.000
I'm going to sit on the couch for another 12 hours.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.360
We'll see you work it out.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.880
I just I just flipped.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.480
I just flipped on this guy.

27:08.480 --> 27:09.720
Fuck this guy.

27:09.720 --> 27:10.720
You fuck this way.

27:10.720 --> 27:11.720
You weren't in camp.

27:11.720 --> 27:12.720
Fuck this guy.

27:12.720 --> 27:19.040
No, I mean, at first I was like, that's rough because he doesn't all he loves this woman

27:19.040 --> 27:20.040
so much.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.040
Right.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.040
Loves her so much.

27:22.040 --> 27:27.960
And the only thing that's keeping their love stagnant is that she smells she smells like

27:27.960 --> 27:28.960
dookie water.

27:28.960 --> 27:32.880
But now it's like, get your shit together.

27:32.880 --> 27:37.040
I'm sure maybe you don't smell good from sitting on the couch all day.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.480
Your bed sores.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.480
And your bed sores.

27:39.480 --> 27:45.960
Maybe you have bed sores and those smell like festering dookie water.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.120
I'm so mad at him.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.120
You are mad at him.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.400
I can tell that this has gotten really real for you.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.800
This has gotten very serious.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.960
I am angry at this gentleman.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.880
Well, who does he think he is?

27:56.880 --> 27:57.880
Right.

27:57.880 --> 28:02.240
But on the other hand, maybe she smells real bad.

28:02.240 --> 28:05.320
I just read a really great answer.

28:05.320 --> 28:06.320
Tell me.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.320
Yahoo!

28:07.320 --> 28:09.000
answers user Drea responded.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.280
Just a suggestion.

28:10.280 --> 28:15.300
Draw a bubble bath for her so that when she walks in the door, it will be ready for her.

28:15.300 --> 28:19.000
Make it romantic if you can add to the mood.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
That's fresh.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
That's a fresh.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.320
That's outside the box thinking.

28:22.320 --> 28:28.080
But see, that's that's just a thinly veiled statement that you smell bad.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.880
That can only work so many times like this.

28:29.880 --> 28:34.680
Like, Seenar, I love you, but I can't take a bath every day as soon as I get home from

28:34.680 --> 28:35.680
the office.

28:35.680 --> 28:36.680
Hey, baby girl.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.680
Hey, baby girl at 630.

28:38.680 --> 28:39.680
And you know what that means.

28:39.680 --> 28:40.680
Rub a dub dub.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.680
Time for your scrub.

28:41.680 --> 28:47.720
I'll be in the, I'll be downstairs watching baseball.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.440
You come get me when you're done for the cuddlin' and the good stuff.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.440
Yeah.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.760
Don't spend too long in there because this hungry man isn't going to microwave itself.

28:55.760 --> 28:56.760
Hey, honey.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.880
I made dinner reservations for us at 630.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.880
Uh, I don't think you did.

29:01.880 --> 29:07.800
I think I think maybe you need to get those changed to 730 because we ain't going out

29:07.800 --> 29:12.240
in public until you get down with a scrub-a-roo.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.240
I love you so much.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.240
I love you, baby.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.240
I love you so much.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.240
Why do you smell so bad?

29:16.240 --> 29:17.240
Where do you work?

29:17.240 --> 29:19.440
You need to quit working at the waste treatment plant.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.440
Ugh.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.440
Ugh.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.440
Ugh.

29:22.440 --> 29:23.440
Leave her.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.440
Ugh.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.800
You're saying leave her and leave him.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.480
Everyone leave each other in this situation.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.480
I'm so mad.

29:30.480 --> 29:34.920
This girl in my class has some sort of love-hate relationship with me.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.780
Sometimes she'll act incredibly flirtatious and sometimes she'll straight up insult me.

29:39.780 --> 29:45.540
Even weirder, she flips out, she flips between these behaviors multiple times each day.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.760
How exactly am I supposed to react to this?

29:47.760 --> 29:52.760
Yes, I'm a dude and in high school, vexed in New Mexico.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.760
Oh, man.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.760
Welcome.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.760
Bienvenidos, muchacho.

29:57.760 --> 30:01.760
You're becoming a man.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.760
Wow.

30:02.760 --> 30:08.400
I bet it does seem like that, doesn't it?

30:08.400 --> 30:21.200
So oh, gosh, you have discovered that occasionally, every once in a while, some girls be crazy.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.200
Women be shopping.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.200
Yeah.

30:23.200 --> 30:26.240
Well, I'm not shopping so much as just crazy.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.240
Yeah.

30:27.240 --> 30:33.640
And there's a good chance that she is straight up crazy, like real crazy, like kill a bunny

30:33.640 --> 30:35.400
on your doorstep crazy.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.400
Right.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.400
Right.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.880
You don't need to marry her.

30:39.880 --> 30:43.520
Maybe she's bad at flirting and she forgets how to do it sometimes.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.520
That's how it hit me.

30:44.520 --> 30:50.120
It hit me like a harmless like, oh, I'm bad at flirting so I'm playfully mocking you.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.240
I think in high school, totally down.

30:52.240 --> 30:59.400
I think once you get to college, then it is usually a sign of crazy talent.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.520
Yeah, I get what you're saying.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.520
And you know what?

31:02.520 --> 31:03.800
You're really sensitive in high school.

31:03.800 --> 31:11.600
So a lot of you got to hear, OK, here's what you do when she insults you.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.180
You got to take it as flirting, too.

31:13.180 --> 31:14.180
You got to get that tough.

31:14.180 --> 31:18.800
You have to be that confident to be able to to be able to handle this Philly.

31:18.800 --> 31:23.580
It seems to me like all that's well and good, but this is a non-issue.

31:23.580 --> 31:26.120
You just stop talking to that person.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.720
He learns nothing.

31:31.720 --> 31:36.760
But you're saying like work through getting insulted at the chance of maybe making out

31:36.760 --> 31:37.760
with this chick.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.520
Like, oh, don't do any of that.

31:39.520 --> 31:43.560
Have no goal other than to let her insults roll off your back.

31:43.560 --> 31:49.380
And if you are into this, this lady, then she will find that irresistible.

31:49.380 --> 31:53.120
You just have to be confident and roll with it.

31:53.120 --> 31:56.220
Like if she insults you, you say, yep, nailed it.

31:56.220 --> 31:57.220
What's up?

31:57.220 --> 31:58.220
Dead on.

31:58.220 --> 31:59.220
What else you got?

31:59.220 --> 32:00.220
You know?

32:00.220 --> 32:05.680
You're not feeling it still well, as long as you're doing it as like a thought exercise.

32:05.680 --> 32:09.720
Like, how many insults can I take before I go home and cry?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.620
Yeah, then go for it.

32:11.620 --> 32:15.320
This isn't going to turn into a relationship if you're just trying to teach her a lesson.

32:15.320 --> 32:20.200
He's the stronger person, but you got to keep in mind.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.340
She's not just insulting him.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.440
She's also flirting with him like that.

32:23.440 --> 32:28.480
That in and of itself, like I can remember plenty of young relationships I had that started

32:28.480 --> 32:32.760
out with like girls flirting with me and also like playfully insulting me.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.080
Dude, Vex, you're in there, dude.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.080
You're in there.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.080
I think you're totally, totally cool.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.080
Yeah.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.080
You need to out crazy her.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.560
And when she flirts with you, get really offended.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.920
And when she insults you, get really turned on.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.480
You smell like you work at Olive Garden.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.180
Get out of my face, hooker.

32:48.180 --> 32:49.180
Say that.

32:49.180 --> 32:50.180
See how that works out.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.180
Don't say it.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.180
Don't say any of that.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.600
Don't say any of that, but say something like that.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.760
Whatever you say in high school.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.520
You're not fire or something.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
Yeah.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.800
You are so not raw.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.040
You're not raw.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.040
You're cooked.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.000
You're cooked in fire.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
You're braised.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
I'm going to set you on fire.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.480
Shit is so cooked.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.680
So I guess we've helped you pretty good.

33:10.680 --> 33:16.880
How do I deal with idiots who park in front of my building and take up several parking

33:16.880 --> 33:17.880
spaces?

33:17.880 --> 33:20.000
This is a recurring problem in the residence hall where I live.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.880
I have considered leaving menacing notes or even bashing their windows out in frustration.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.880
Whoa.

33:25.880 --> 33:26.880
Whoa.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.200
I'm going to park far away and I don't know where else to turn.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.200
Please help.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.320
Zune user, Gmail.

33:32.320 --> 33:37.160
This is another one of those terrible self-centered people problems that always happens.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.720
Those people that like park in the middle of two parking spaces because they don't want

33:40.720 --> 33:44.560
their like 1986 Buick LeSabre to get scratched up.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.560
Yep.

33:45.560 --> 33:46.560
Oh God.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.560
I hate those people so much.

33:47.560 --> 33:50.720
Can I give an embarrassing confession to you guys?

33:50.720 --> 33:55.840
What I do is I walk past their car and I key it.

33:55.840 --> 33:56.840
I have done it.

33:56.840 --> 33:57.840
You don't really do that.

33:57.840 --> 34:03.920
Griffin, five or six times someone has taken a parking spot and they take up two spots

34:03.920 --> 34:08.760
and I key their car because oops, the opposite happened.

34:08.760 --> 34:09.760
Oops.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.960
That punishment does not fit that crime at all.

34:11.960 --> 34:12.960
It totally fits that crime.

34:12.960 --> 34:13.960
I disagree.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
You learned your lesson.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.960
You've learned your lesson.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.760
That is not, you are not going to do that again.

34:18.760 --> 34:24.120
Maybe it's just like a 16 year old kid who like hasn't learned how to park yet and that's

34:24.120 --> 34:28.960
his new Jetta and you just, you just, you just, you know, ruined his Christmas.

34:28.960 --> 34:29.960
Learn to park.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.120
Bounce it out, scratch into the car.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.120
I love you.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.640
No, don't do that.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.640
I key it.

34:36.640 --> 34:40.320
I don't do something like big and pronounced, but if you're the sort who would get obsessed

34:40.320 --> 34:44.220
about your car, you're going to notice that and you're going to not do that anymore.

34:44.220 --> 34:45.220
It's a lesson.

34:45.220 --> 34:48.760
I've taught you a lesson about growth.

34:48.760 --> 34:54.040
And maybe just, you know, if you want to go a little less, you know, invasive, just leave

34:54.040 --> 34:58.680
a ball print on his window, pop your balls out, push them against there.

34:58.680 --> 34:59.680
Keep on moving.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.120
See, that's good because it's, it's, it's temporary.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.520
You don't have to pay to get it buffed out.

35:04.520 --> 35:11.120
Um, but also you touch your balls on a surface, which I guess a little post-it note next to

35:11.120 --> 35:14.200
it with an arrow that says, those are my balls, though.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.240
My balls touch these.

35:16.240 --> 35:21.360
Don't leave some fucking passive aggressive note though, like, Hey, good parking job that

35:21.360 --> 35:23.000
you did there, dude.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.920
Like that's the D that's even douchier.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.160
I think then maybe you give them a warning.

35:27.160 --> 35:31.360
Maybe you give them a warning note, say, Hey, if you do this again, I'm going to key your

35:31.360 --> 35:32.360
car.

35:32.360 --> 35:36.400
And then if it happens again, Griffin, can you agree that you'd be well within your rights

35:36.400 --> 35:39.340
at that point?

35:39.340 --> 35:41.560
I would say two warnings just to be safe.

35:41.560 --> 35:46.280
The first one, like, Hey, um, just to let you know, do you have one more, uh, one more

35:46.280 --> 35:47.280
warning shot?

35:47.280 --> 35:49.720
Uh, but you are getting awfully close to key town.

35:49.720 --> 35:53.680
Uh, and then the second one's like, Hey dude, no kidding.

35:53.680 --> 35:59.440
Um, you have one, this is your last, this is your last chance before a retribution.

35:59.440 --> 36:06.280
And then I think you can leave a small, a small key scratch on like the two warnings.

36:06.280 --> 36:09.000
You can set the hood of his car on fire.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.840
Well, by small key scratch, uh, he means if you could scratch a review for my brother,

36:13.840 --> 36:18.560
my brother and me and just a, our web address into there, that would be great.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
Yeah.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.880
Just scratch our names and addresses in there.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.880
It's all great.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.020
It's all good stuff, right?

36:24.020 --> 36:30.160
And make sure you scratch in the method in which each of us would least like to be murdered.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.240
Mine is stabbing.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.880
I don't, I think Travis is drowning and Justin's fire.

36:34.880 --> 36:35.880
No.

36:35.880 --> 36:36.880
Yeah, you know he is.

36:36.880 --> 36:37.880
What's up?

36:37.880 --> 36:45.320
That is so, so cash, so raw, Justin's fucking young money.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.320
Don't do anything.

36:46.320 --> 36:50.720
Cause this fucking, this hamster wheel we all live on, this hamster wheel called life

36:50.720 --> 36:55.600
keeps on spinning and like, if people are douches, they're going to get, they're going

36:55.600 --> 36:56.600
to get there.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.600
They are.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.600
They are.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.960
And you are to be the instrument of that getting.

36:59.960 --> 37:00.960
Exactly.

37:00.960 --> 37:05.820
You are not the arbiter of God's justice that you lay down with your fiery key.

37:05.820 --> 37:07.520
How do you know till you do it?

37:07.520 --> 37:11.920
Unless, unless there are good people willing to stand up for what they believe in, then

37:11.920 --> 37:15.160
all God's got is a handful of wishes and hopes.

37:15.160 --> 37:19.680
The people in this world that do that shit and park and take up like three parking spaces

37:19.680 --> 37:21.400
with their stupid hummers.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.480
It's because no one ever does anything.

37:24.480 --> 37:29.160
They'll leave like a little post that says, oh, please don't take up these parking spaces

37:29.160 --> 37:30.160
anymore.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.760
You got to get out there and just pee in their window.

37:33.760 --> 37:35.840
Set the, set the hood on fire.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
I like that.

37:36.840 --> 37:37.840
Set the hood on fire.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.800
Stand on top of it and say, this is a symbol.

37:40.800 --> 37:41.800
This is a symbol.

37:41.800 --> 37:46.320
Put a symbol on the car in lighter fluid and light it on fire so it burns like a hand given

37:46.320 --> 37:47.320
the finger.

37:47.320 --> 37:48.320
Yeah.

37:48.320 --> 37:53.080
I feel like we need to rerun the disclaimer that Bob Ball does at the beginning of the

37:53.080 --> 37:57.280
show, like right here, like right in the middle of the show so that people know not to actually

37:57.280 --> 37:58.280
do any of these things.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.800
How about putting lunch meat all over their car?

38:00.800 --> 38:01.800
Oops.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.600
No, cause that like eats the pain off.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.160
But like turkey, turkey won't do that.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.680
Just cover their car in turkey.

38:06.680 --> 38:07.680
Got a bologna.

38:07.680 --> 38:11.240
And leave a message that's like, I just gave you a turkey car.

38:11.240 --> 38:14.120
You're going turkey car.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.120
Gobble gobble, bitch.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.400
Gobble gobble, bitch.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.400
Learn to park.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.240
This shit's hickory smoke, dummy.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.640
I just hickory smoked your shit.

38:23.640 --> 38:24.640
Not fire.

38:24.640 --> 38:25.640
How about a Yahoo?

38:25.640 --> 38:26.640
Yeah.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.640
Break me off of a slice.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.640
This one was sent in by Louie Dog again.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.640
Thanks Louie.

38:29.640 --> 38:34.480
That's by Yahoo Answers user, Dansby, who asks, I think we've actually had a question

38:34.480 --> 38:36.320
by Dansby before.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.240
That name felt familiar in my mouth.

38:38.240 --> 38:44.280
Anyway, Dansby asks, is it okay to use worn out underwear as packing materials for holiday

38:44.280 --> 38:45.280
gifts?

38:45.280 --> 38:51.320
Well, the holidays are coming up and I have a big bin full of worn out underwear that

38:51.320 --> 38:53.640
our family has been accumulating for a while.

38:53.640 --> 38:56.880
I know I need some cushioning material for shipping out holiday gifts.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.680
Is it acceptable to use the underwear for this purpose?

38:59.680 --> 39:03.660
Of course the present will be inside a wrap box inside the shipping box, so it's not like

39:03.660 --> 39:05.640
it will be inside the gift.

39:05.640 --> 39:10.600
BQ, what's your favorite winter holiday song?

39:10.600 --> 39:12.960
What kind of fucking family are you in?

39:12.960 --> 39:18.220
I think my favorite winter holiday song is You Ruined Our Christmas With Your Stinky

39:18.220 --> 39:21.480
Awful Old Underwear That You Wrapped Around The iPod.

39:21.480 --> 39:25.080
Why does your family have a bin of worn out underwear?

39:25.080 --> 39:27.420
Well, additional details.

39:27.420 --> 39:30.540
Our family tries very, very hard to be eco-friendly.

39:30.540 --> 39:34.080
We don't have anything else to use and the thought of buying extra paper or bubble wrap

39:34.080 --> 39:36.360
to waste makes me cry for the earth.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.160
You know what makes me cry for the earth?

39:38.160 --> 39:42.080
You know what makes me cry for the earth?

39:42.080 --> 39:43.680
Your stinky awful underwear.

39:43.680 --> 39:48.520
The crap that you're shipping through, you're shipping it through the US Postal Service.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.680
I send my rent check to my landlord through that.

39:51.680 --> 39:55.340
I could open up, you might live in my neighborhood, I might open up your mailbox and get like

39:55.340 --> 40:02.260
a fucking pungent, like a foamy spume of your fucking stinky old underwear that hits me

40:02.260 --> 40:07.400
in the nose and stays with me for the rest of my life.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.400
Oh fuck.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.200
It makes me mad that it sounds like you've already made this decision because you've

40:11.200 --> 40:13.600
been collecting this underwear for a while now.

40:13.600 --> 40:14.600
Yeah!

40:14.600 --> 40:15.600
What have you been doing?

40:15.600 --> 40:16.600
Where are you keeping it?

40:16.600 --> 40:21.200
Hey, uh, hey dude, if you have to send it in dirty underwear, it ain't a gift.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.920
It ain't a gift, it's an oppa gift.

40:24.920 --> 40:25.920
God damn it.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.520
I don't, like these green questions are straight bombing me out.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.760
They're really harshing my mellow.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.960
I wouldn't give a fuck if the earth had like six years left in it.

40:33.960 --> 40:37.840
If the earth had four years left in it and people didn't send underwear through the US

40:37.840 --> 40:41.840
Postal Service, like, that's a trade off I'm willing to make.

40:41.840 --> 40:49.880
It can go 2012 up in 2016 as long as, as long as people stop pooping in bags and sending

40:49.880 --> 40:51.720
their dirty ass underwear to their aunt.

40:51.720 --> 40:56.880
All I can think is there has to come a moment where like you go to pull out a pair of underwear

40:56.880 --> 41:01.040
and you're like, oh this is covered in stains and the elastic is shot and your mom's like

41:01.040 --> 41:02.800
put it in the bin.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.120
Like put it right in the bin.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.120
Get it in the bin.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.120
No!

41:06.120 --> 41:07.120
Fucking throw that shit out!

41:07.120 --> 41:08.120
Throw it away!

41:08.120 --> 41:13.240
You're not going to reuse those textiles, don't, don't fucking kid yourself.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.040
Hey check out my new winter coat.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.920
Lots of boxers went into this one.

41:17.920 --> 41:21.920
Uh, did you uh, did you get that package?

41:21.920 --> 41:23.760
Did you, did you open that package from Daniel?

41:23.760 --> 41:24.960
Yeah, I did.

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
What was inside of it?

41:25.960 --> 41:29.920
Uh, a bunch of dirty underwear and a picture of a car.

41:29.920 --> 41:30.920
So I don't know.

41:30.920 --> 41:31.920
How's your Christmas?

41:31.920 --> 41:33.680
It's the best Christmas ever.

41:33.680 --> 41:34.680
Thanks for asking.

41:34.680 --> 41:41.080
Yeah, my husband got me a picture of a car and my crazy cousin sent me a, a, a package

41:41.080 --> 41:44.840
of new underwear wrapped in dirty underwear.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.400
So uh, it's been a pretty good holiday so far.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.280
Thanks for being born, Jay-Z.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.520
God I hate everyone.

41:50.520 --> 41:53.080
I hate everyone so much.

41:53.080 --> 41:54.080
Especially green people.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.080
Just let it burn.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.080
I know.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.080
Let it burn.

41:57.080 --> 42:04.760
Let's ride this bitch into the ground and then, and then everything will be a wasteland

42:04.760 --> 42:09.480
and the population of the planet will be just decimated, but we'll be a small community

42:09.480 --> 42:11.400
and we can start over, right?

42:11.400 --> 42:12.880
And there won't be any internet.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.880
There won't be any internet and people can't do things like go on the internet and ask

42:16.880 --> 42:22.960
if they can send their dirty, stupid underwear to their, to their familial relations.

42:22.960 --> 42:28.120
It's like that question of, you know, you're, you're extending life, but are you improving

42:28.120 --> 42:29.120
life?

42:29.120 --> 42:30.120
You know what I mean?

42:30.120 --> 42:37.080
If I could live to 200 but I'm buried in a pile of used underpants, I'd kill myself.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.080
Yeah.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.080
It's not worth it.

42:39.080 --> 42:40.080
It's, it's about trade-offs.

42:40.080 --> 42:44.480
The earth's not worth preserving if it's full of a bunch of dirty underwear savers.

42:44.480 --> 42:49.200
I guarantee you flash forward like 200 years to like my great, great, great, great, great

42:49.200 --> 42:52.040
grandkids and you're like, Hey, how do you like the earth?

42:52.040 --> 42:56.920
And they're like, I just wish everyone would throw away their old underwear.

42:56.920 --> 42:59.800
We are knee deep in old underwear up in this bitch.

42:59.800 --> 43:00.800
Please listen.

43:00.800 --> 43:06.400
I, I'm not endorsing a completely hedonistic lifestyle, right?

43:06.400 --> 43:09.480
Like I, I recycle.

43:09.480 --> 43:15.660
I just don't think it's too much to ask that we just like, we throw our underwear away

43:15.660 --> 43:20.880
and when you ship things to people, if you don't want to use paper or bubble wrap, you

43:20.880 --> 43:22.560
just got to risk it.

43:22.560 --> 43:26.040
You got to risk the fact that your, your presence is going to break.

43:26.040 --> 43:27.120
Leaves are everywhere.

43:27.120 --> 43:28.120
There are leaves.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.120
You love the earth.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.120
Use some leaves.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.120
Yeah.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.640
There are so many other options here.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.920
Why is that the option you go to?

43:35.920 --> 43:42.720
I would rather rip up my carpet and put it in the box or use like an old my own hair.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.640
Use an old coat.

43:44.640 --> 43:49.880
Don't use, don't use the only article of clothing that touches your balls and everything.

43:49.880 --> 43:56.520
I, I want to hear Griffin's last question.

43:56.520 --> 43:59.680
But first of a few housekeeping notes.

43:59.680 --> 44:05.080
My brother, my brother and me has a website, it's mbmbam.com.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.080
If you go there, you can chat with other fans.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.320
We've got hundreds of users there talking up.

44:09.320 --> 44:10.400
We have ranks now.

44:10.400 --> 44:14.120
So the more you post, the higher your, your rank is.

44:14.120 --> 44:19.760
You can get to, I think honorary brother is the highest rank, which everyone should really

44:19.760 --> 44:22.320
be, you know, be shooting for.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.320
Strive for that.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.760
But you'll also be Jeffrey for a good long while if you get high enough.

44:26.760 --> 44:30.040
So that's worth it.

44:30.040 --> 44:33.920
We really appreciate everybody tweeting about the show.

44:33.920 --> 44:38.560
The download numbers continue to grow just because you're telling your friends and talking

44:38.560 --> 44:39.560
about it.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.120
Please, please, please keep that up.

44:41.120 --> 44:45.480
If you haven't, give us a review on iTunes.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.400
That helps get the word out.

44:47.400 --> 44:52.120
And tweet about the show, you know, if you, if you think of it, if you got room in there,

44:52.120 --> 44:56.000
you want to throw a link to the site, just so people know how to get their adventure

44:56.000 --> 44:57.360
started.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.560
That would, that would be great.

44:59.560 --> 45:05.000
And every week we receive, you know, wonderfully funny and insightful questions, but we always

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
want more.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.440
We always want to hear from you.

45:07.440 --> 45:11.400
You know, you can send in a question, you can send in a comment, you can tell us about

45:11.400 --> 45:17.280
how our advice touched you in some way, though it should not, it should never touch you.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.760
But if we can tickle, we can tickle your funny bone.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.840
We just shouldn't tickle your practical bone, right?

45:21.840 --> 45:22.840
Your practicality.

45:22.840 --> 45:27.320
Let us know so that we can be held liable for it.

45:27.320 --> 45:32.560
And you know, just, you can email us, MBMBAM at gmail.com.

45:32.560 --> 45:37.560
You can tweet at us, hashtag MBMBAM.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.200
The website has all this on there.

45:39.200 --> 45:43.400
You can, you know, there's a place to send a question straight through the website and

45:43.400 --> 45:48.200
hit up FormSpring and you know, maybe eventually we'll go on there and clear out some of the

45:48.200 --> 45:54.040
FormSpring questions, the thousands and thousands we have saved up.

45:54.040 --> 45:58.540
I feel like we should, I don't want to bring the energy down, but I feel like we should

45:58.540 --> 46:06.000
address the, the, the podcast awards because we, I'm not going to call bullshit all the,

46:06.000 --> 46:09.880
all the nominees, they, you know, they're great, great shows.

46:09.880 --> 46:12.880
They're very deserving.

46:12.880 --> 46:13.880
But boycott.

46:13.880 --> 46:14.880
Yep.

46:14.880 --> 46:15.880
Whoa.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.360
I'm boycotting that shit.

46:17.360 --> 46:20.840
I got my invitation down in Santa Cruz.

46:20.840 --> 46:21.840
Not going.

46:21.840 --> 46:22.840
Fuck that noise.

46:22.840 --> 46:23.840
Fuck that noise.

46:23.840 --> 46:24.840
I even bought a tux and everything.

46:24.840 --> 46:29.000
You will not have my attendance, sirs.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
I'm down with that.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Yeah, me too.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
We're not going.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.760
Thank you everybody who voted for us though.

46:33.760 --> 46:34.760
Yeah.

46:34.760 --> 46:39.240
I just wish you had tried, you know, maybe a little, maybe a little bit harder.

46:39.240 --> 46:43.760
I decided to start my own podcast awards and what's it called?

46:43.760 --> 46:45.720
Spoiler alert.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.720
We won.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.720
Yay.

46:47.720 --> 46:48.720
The Bambi's.

46:48.720 --> 46:49.720
The Bambi's.

46:49.720 --> 46:50.720
The Bambi's.

46:50.720 --> 46:56.080
You can vote for them at Bambi's awards for mybrothermybrothermade.com.

46:56.080 --> 46:59.000
No, it's.gov.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Is it.gov now?

47:00.000 --> 47:01.540
Yeah, it's government sponsored.

47:01.540 --> 47:08.480
We got a national endowment for the arts thing that we're giving out like grants, but, and

47:08.480 --> 47:10.200
we're giving them to each other for Christmas.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.600
Merry Christmas, everybody.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.600
One more.

47:12.600 --> 47:17.200
I got you a national endowment to the arts grant and I wrapped it in underwear.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.600
It's a picture of a national endowment to the arts grant.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.600
Yeah, it's coming.

47:20.600 --> 47:21.600
It's coming soon.

47:21.600 --> 47:27.360
Travis, I don't know if this is something we need to address on the show, but I am curious

47:27.360 --> 47:32.280
why in the show notes you prepared, there is a picture of a dog in a bee costume.

47:32.280 --> 47:34.200
Well, Justin, I'm glad you asked.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.200
God damn it.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.640
This is going to be the longest episode ever now.

47:37.640 --> 47:40.760
The bee dog touches us all.

47:40.760 --> 47:44.960
In our life, we are touched by the bee dog in ways you can't even begin to imagine.

47:44.960 --> 47:45.960
Why is it there?

47:45.960 --> 47:46.960
I don't understand.

47:46.960 --> 47:50.840
It's not just this email, though, it's the past like three or four emails there's been

47:50.840 --> 47:56.180
a bee dog at the bottom and we've never, we've just like ignored it, but been aware of it.

47:56.180 --> 47:57.920
I've embraced the bee dog love.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.280
I've embraced the warm love.

47:59.280 --> 48:02.080
Is it the same bee dog every time and I've just been missing this?

48:02.080 --> 48:04.520
No, no, no, but it usually is a pug.

48:04.520 --> 48:06.520
It almost certainly is a pug bee dog.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.880
Well, they make the best bee dogs.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.400
They have bee like features, right?

48:09.400 --> 48:13.080
They got that tiny little nubby tail, looks like a stinger.

48:13.080 --> 48:17.920
I think I don't like, the only problem I have with the bee dog is that it's sort of-

48:17.920 --> 48:18.920
Is nothing?

48:18.920 --> 48:19.920
You have no problem with the bee dog?

48:19.920 --> 48:20.920
No, no, no.

48:20.920 --> 48:24.420
It's looking at me while I'm trying to record the show and saying, I'm effortlessly funnier

48:24.420 --> 48:28.080
than you.

48:28.080 --> 48:31.840
What I am doing is funnier than the thing you are doing right now just by being in this

48:31.840 --> 48:32.840
costume.

48:32.840 --> 48:36.240
See, when I look at the bee dog, what I see is him saying, don't worry.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.800
I got it.

48:37.800 --> 48:38.800
Whatever that might be.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.800
I got this.

48:39.800 --> 48:40.800
It doesn't matter.

48:40.800 --> 48:41.800
I got this thing for you.

48:41.800 --> 48:47.300
I just think about what pug nectar tastes like and his bad, his bad thing.

48:47.300 --> 48:51.040
Don't forget to pre-order shirts.

48:51.040 --> 48:56.800
If you want a sweatshirt, you're going to help raise money for Big Brothers, Big Sisters,

48:56.800 --> 48:59.420
and you need to pre-order one of those if you want them.

48:59.420 --> 49:05.420
So I'm not sure how much longer we are doing pre-orders, need to probably figure that out,

49:05.420 --> 49:08.560
but act fast because it won't be long.

49:08.560 --> 49:12.520
If you order right away, you can make sure to get your order by Christmas time.

49:12.520 --> 49:16.160
So go do that right now at bmbam.com.

49:16.160 --> 49:21.160
You can see the link on the right hand side with all our mugs and shirts and all that

49:21.160 --> 49:22.160
crap.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.160
So, Griffin.

49:23.160 --> 49:29.280
This one was sent in, you're not going to believe this, by Jacob Locker.

49:29.280 --> 49:34.200
He can't like, no one can topple him from this throne that he has built using his own

49:34.200 --> 49:38.240
two hands and clay as the showstopper.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.240
That's his new name.

49:39.240 --> 49:40.240
Jacob Locker, the showstopper.

49:40.240 --> 49:42.600
Wow, that's got a nice kind of rhythm to it.

49:42.600 --> 49:43.600
Yeah, I like it a lot.

49:43.600 --> 49:50.760
This one was sent in by Yahoo Answers, er, it was by Yahoo Answers user, Lynn Craven,

49:50.760 --> 49:56.280
who asks, does a fart contain DNA?

49:56.280 --> 49:59.280
I'm Justin McElroy.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.280
I'm Travis McElroy.

50:02.280 --> 50:04.600
I'm Griffin.

50:04.600 --> 50:22.840
This has been my brother, my brother, may he kiss your dad square on the lips.
