00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Like the Chilean miners emerging.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Like Chilean miners.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Is that a reboot? Is that what this is? Are we refreshing the franchise?

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
This is just celebrating the hardworking miners of Chile.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Of what?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
This isn't like about anything. I'm just glad that they're there.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah, my ice cream break's coming up too. You wanna maybe go to Chile? Maybe we could go chill on the beaches of Chile.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Like Chilean miners emerging from a mine. We've returned for another week.

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
You know, a lot of people liked that when I did it right after those famous guys came out, so I thought, what if I brought it back?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
I mean, Chilean miners are still coming out of mines.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Sure, yeah. They haven't stopped, I hope.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Right? I mean, they're going in there getting butane and gold. I don't know.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
They're getting butane?

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
They go down there with just plastic shopping bags and they just scoop up the butte.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
So we're back for a second run on the Max Fun Network. Thank you so much for rejoining us.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
This is my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era. I am Justin McElroy.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
You're gonna pry that Chilean miner bit from my cold dead hands.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
But again, we've reemerged. Second week on Max Fun Network.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
The response from you guys was so, so nice. Really meant a lot.

02:15.000 --> 02:26.000
If you haven't been to the forums yet, over at Max Fun, there's a lot of good discussion, both NBNB AM and NBNB AM non-related.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
So move over there and there's a thread, a new Max Fun podcast.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
My brother, my brother and me. You can introduce yourself, say hi.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
But everybody's getting acquainted there. Let's get acquainted here with some wisdom.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Let's go with our first question. What do you guys say?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Just get into it.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
My friends keep on telling me that if I don't go to my senior prom, I'll regret it.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Personally, I don't care for dancing and wasting money.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Is this one of those things I'll regret not doing when I'm old?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Anti-Footloose Gmail.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
I actually made up that name because they didn't attach one and I really wanted to talk about footloose.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, good. Oh, good.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Good, Travis.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
This show has become a construction.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Isn't that perjury? Isn't that what that is? Isn't that illegal?

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I don't believe in perjury in this guy.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
No, but I think it's definitely about the ritual.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
It's not inherently fun, but you'll be kind of a lonely heart, I think, if you don't go, right?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
You have to go.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
You have to go.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah, the thing is, this is that future, present tense time travel thing.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Look to the future 20 years from now.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
You don't want to be the person that says, oh, no, I didn't go to my senior prom.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Because everyone you tell that to will go, oh, why not?

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
You have to go. It's part of your growing up. It's part of life.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Plus, there's got to be a girl, you can ask. There's always a girl.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
I know you don't like wasting money and dancing, but you'll be surprised how little of the dancing you'll actually do.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
And it's not a waste. It's like a traditional, I don't know.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, most importantly, you only get one shot at it.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
It's not like, well, I don't want to go now. I'll try again in five years.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
This is your only chance to go to your senior prom.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
It's a good point.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
That's actually a common misconception, Travis.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
You can keep going to high school dances after you have left that particular educational institution.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Which reminds me, we do need to wrap this show early.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
I need to get over to Skeffington's to pick up my tails.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Nice.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, it's going to be rough, Anti-Footloose. It's going to be bad.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
I can't think. I don't know. I never looked forward to my formal dances whenever I was in high school.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
I actually almost skipped one because I was going to go stag.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
But instead, I just stayed home and I played EverQuest for most of the night.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I mean, it was right after the Dungeons of Narath expansion came out.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah, sure, sure.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
But I did end up going, you've got to pay the money.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
You've got to pay your dues and maybe you'll rub your wiener on a butt to hip-hop music.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
There's an exchange there.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It is a trade-off.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But yeah, you'll regret it if you don't go years from now.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Maybe not immediately.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And it won't be fun, but at least you'll have been there.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And you can lie about it later.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
It's also a really good excuse to ask somebody out if you're even trying to work up the nerve.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Because everybody needs a date. Nobody wants to go solo.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
So take advantage of that and prey on their desperation.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
What should I do about a girl in my class who's a terrible buzzkill?

05:48.000 --> 05:57.000
She always inserts herself into everyone's conversations and ruins the fun by talking about her divorced parents, human trafficking, or 9-11.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Was that good, Travis?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
You like your little chuckle?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I think that person would be awesome.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
A little chuckle from 9-11. Good, good.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm trying to imagine that conversation.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's like, do you guys want to go to Chipotle for lunch?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Do you maybe want to hit up Panera?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Hey, by the way, that reminds me. 9-11.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
I remember the last time I went to Chipotle, it's when my divorced parents sold me into slavery.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
If I remember correctly, it was September 11th.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Have a good burrito.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Enjoy. Enjoy your meal.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to bummer all over your chips.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
What is it? Did you get the spicy aioli?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
That's nice. You know who loves that? Osama bin Laden.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
He gets it in his beard.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Are you going to get vegetables?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I'll tell you about a vegetable I know.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I remember Terry Shivo.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Whoa!

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
It's not time for the Shive to come back.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
I may have jumped the gun a little bit there.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
A little bit, but somebody's got to push into the light, right?

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
Somebody's got to determine how long the deadline is on stuff like that.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I'd let that one simmer for another six months.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I would say you've got to try to trump them.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
No matter how dark they go, you've got to go darker.

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
Divorce parents, go Batman, talk about dead parents.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
They won't see that coming.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Push them into a darker place until you're bumming them out,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
and maybe they'll get the message.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I have a way better idea.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Oh, good.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Better than bring up Terry Shivo?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
No, it has nothing to do with that.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
Why don't you learn to play and then constantly carry around a cornet

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
or a small trumpet and just carry it around,

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
and any time she opens her mouth to say literally anything,

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
just start playing a happy little St. Louis jazz number.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Just like a little bit of Zadaran's.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Just get in there right in her face and just like...

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
Nobody can speak, first of all, or be sad when they hear that music.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Who could be sad?

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
That's an interesting point you just made about super aids sweeping across Africa.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I'd like to counter with some Zydeco.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Everybody buckle in.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
So either super dark or super light.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo for us, a Yahoo Answers request?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Sure, sure, sure. I have a few.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
How about this one? It was sent in by Jonathan Bartram.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Thank you, Jonathan Bartram.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Dr. Know-It-All, who asks...

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
That's an ironic, unfortunate name for a Yahoo Answers user.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I've been sold a false bill of goods here.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Dr. Know-It-All asks,

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
If you lived on a beach and overnight all the sand miraculously turned to cocaine, what would you do?

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
Dr. Blow-It-All, that's who he...

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
He mistyped.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, snow angel, right? Blow angel first.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
You make an angel in that sweet, sweet coca, but that seems pretty obvious.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Coca-castles?

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
Well, I think the first thing I would do is contact the Pope and say, there's been a miracle.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Coke miracle.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
First, alert the authorities.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
You can't take any chances with this.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It just seems dangerous, right?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
It just seems dangerous.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Kids could wander in there.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
If I know one thing about the beach, sand gets everywhere.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Hey, what about some answers?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
What if I just read some of this special help?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah, what do people say?

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
Steven Adler says, clean the beach.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Seems like it'd be pretty tough.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah, it's all cocaine.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Just get in there with a fucking Swiffer wet jet and get all the coca up.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Alessa says, die of cocaine overdose.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
That's a pretty good plan, I guess.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Two people rated that answer as good.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Pretty good answer.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Pretty good.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
It is the apocalypse.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
You might as well wrap it up.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Holy Phoenix said, get rod the fuck out.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
How do you get rod?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Spell that for me.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
R-A-W-E-D.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
He went ahead and he took the word raw.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Just extended.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And he done verbed it.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
He verbed it out.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
So get rod the fuck out.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
How rod are you right now?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
I'm pretty rod.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
I have been sniffing this beach for a half hour.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
You know what irritates me is when you see the dealers out there dumping huge bags of flour.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's like gift horse in the mouth.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
They're still going to cut it?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Come on, man.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Is that baking soda?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
What are you doing?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Just back it up and sell it.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It would decrease the market value, though.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
That would be bad for dealers, I think, if there was a Coke beach.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah, I mean, there are a few people who are suggesting a little bit of profiteering.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I don't know.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
How are you going to sell that?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Hey, I have some beach here.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Will you pay me for it?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I think I'll just go to the beach.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Thanks.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
There might be some shark's teeth in there, so a little bonus for the kids.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
They're all rotting down in nubs.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
Dr. House says, roll up a $50 note and have a snorkel.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
That's actually pretty good.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Oh, you still take bumps of Coca?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Not me.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
I take snorkels.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I just did three snorks.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm tripping out my mind.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You tripping?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
You trip on Coke?

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
The greatest mind of our generation says, well, there's enough to experiment, so instead

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
of snorting it, we add some Kool-Aid and then make an enema.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
What?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
What?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
How does that thought process work?

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
What I love, that seems to imply that he's often thought, man, I would love to have a

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Coke enema, but I just don't have enough.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I don't have enough to experiment with.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I think you've got to get out there for a Coke ball fight.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Just mix them up and toss them at each other.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Build a Coke man.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
That seems like it.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
That would be fun for about 35 seconds.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
I mean, I haven't done, I have never done the Coca, so I don't know how quickly it sets

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
off, how quickly it activates within you, but I imagine that it's pretty quickly, especially

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
when you're having a good time bouncing around throwing Coke balls at each other.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
You should come over to my house.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
It's the home of the world's coolest beach whale.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Come check him out.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
He's a fun guy.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
He sits out there asking how into Mark McGrath you are.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
His blowhole's just so crusty and terrible to look at.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
It's closed up.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Mark McGrath?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Mark McGrath, huge Coke head.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Mark McGrath, I bet.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't know.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't know either.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
That's the Sugar Ray gentleman, right?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Sugar Ray?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah, Sugar Ray.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
I don't know good Coke music.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
What's Coke music?

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
I can't imagine that Sugar Ray is too low on that list.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
It seems like a Cokey band, doesn't it?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Sugar Ray seems Cokey.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Well, I mean, everybody's seen that video, right, where Mark McGrath is walking into

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
some bar and some 12-year-old kid yells Sugar Yay at him, and he flips the fuck out and

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
gets in the kid's face and just takes a bite out of him.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
What?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
That's the weirdest music video I've ever heard of.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
He takes a bite out of a kid?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
He bites him?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I mean, he doesn't literally take a bite out of him.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I was speaking figuratively.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
He got up in his grill.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
You know, I don't appreciate that.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Sugar Gay, that's pretty good, though.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
Should we talk about, because this is going to interrupt the flow, and I apologize for

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
that, but I have my reasons.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
Last night, something big happened to the world.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
A baby was born, but not a literal one.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
Well, a literal one probably was born somewhere, just statistically.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
But we had nothing to do with that baby.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
No.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Or did we?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Or did we?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Get the blood test done, Jay.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
I'm speaking, of course, about Rocky Horror's My Brother, My Brother, and Me mixtape, available

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
now for kids of all ages.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
We'll have a link in the post for people to download it for free.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
It is the freshest thing ever recorded by mankind.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
We should put it on the Maximum Fun blog, too, right?

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
That's what I was talking about.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Do you think I still use our old website?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
No.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
How gauche.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
1.0.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
It really is super fresh, Rocky Horror did a great job with it, and I think if there's

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
ever a lull in this episode, maybe I can just splice in a few seconds of a track.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
There's samples online, and people can get it.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
It's for free, right?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
You just get it.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
It is for free.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
No problem.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
Not surprisingly, my favorite track on there is a track called Travis Was Right.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Don't ruin the surprise.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
That track is fresh.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
I won't say anything, but it may be the happiest I've ever been.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
The album has an arc to it.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
It has a narrative.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
It is a narrative.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Yeah.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
There's a nice, they call them chill downs at the end.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
There's a chill down, right?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
That's what they're called.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
There's a chill down, there's a chill back.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
There's a beat flip, which is, I like that one.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
He does like two beat flips, and I was pretty impressed.

15:50.000 --> 16:01.000
He drops that bass so heavy low, and that's probably my favorite part of the album.

16:01.000 --> 16:09.000
We should just make this show about dance hall, dance hall techno dance, techno dance.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Is that the genre?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
It's techno dance, right?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
That's perfect.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
We can do an instructional thing.

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
We can talk about your best techno techniques, like when you drop that bass so heavy low.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
That's important.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
There's a dance move associated with that, so we can say, when it's time to drop that

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
bass, you've got to twist your heels outwards and drop your knees down a little bit, and

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
shake two fingers to the floor like you're telling it no, and then we'll tell people

16:39.000 --> 16:51.000
to do that, and then we'll put on a clip of the mixtape like right now.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
And people can get their learn on.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, I think that this could be really super instructional.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
So are you saying that our podcast could become a vehicle for us to mention new music that

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
we discover in the world?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Oh no.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Oh no, I know where this is going.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
Say that one of the three of us discovered a mystery CD titled Fart Touch, and we played

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
that song, and it was magical.

17:17.000 --> 17:25.000
Travis, walk me through this, Travis sends us this email that says, I found a CD called

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Fart Touch.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
No, no, no.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
This is a much more mysterious event.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm going through my CDs and Teresa's CDs, and we discover this CD simply titled Fart

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Touch.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Neither one of us has any idea where this CD came from.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
Neither one of you will admit to having any idea where this CD came from.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Gotcha.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
At any point did you put this CD in your computer?

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
It took me four days of just walking by as we're cleaning up the house, saying things

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
like, and where should we carefully store Fart Touch?

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
And eventually I was like, fuck it, I have to find out what's on the CD and discovered

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
a song I strangely called Fart Touch.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh, imagine that.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
It's perhaps the greatest song I've ever heard in my life.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
And here's the clip.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
You got that Fart Touch, who got that Fart Touch?

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
You got that Fart Touch, who got that Fart Touch?

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
I have literally listened to that song nine times in the last two hours.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
Let me ask you though, Travis, did you put the CD in your computer to listen to it?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I imagine that you did, right?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Yes, I did.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yes.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Okay.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
This is where you get viruses and shit.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
If I saw a piece of digital media that had the words Fart Touch scrawled upon it, like,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I wouldn't want to know what's on there.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
I certainly wouldn't subject my computer's hard drive to it.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
You learn so much about your brothers doing a weekly advice show with them, because if

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
I saw something called Fart Touch, the signal would not be able to get from my eyes to my

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
brain to compute that it's a Fart Touch before my finger would be on the open button on the

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
computer.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
I would already be loading it just as my brain was like, Fart Touch?

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Like, I couldn't get that in fast enough.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Are you kidding me?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Fart Touch?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I'm there.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Like, yeah, of course, naturally.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
I think that says a lot about us though, because, like, I don't know, you two seem to take more

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
risks than I do.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Like, you see a Fart Touch CD and you just jump right for it.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
You know that a ship in harbor is safe, but that's not what ships are for.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
They're for sailing to the open seas and finding Fart Touches.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm on the SS Fart Touch and I'm out there for adventure.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
You two's biggest risk was recording Fart Touch, I think.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
We've not given advice for a little while.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
I think we gave some pretty, like, advice by association.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Don't listen to Fart Touch.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
I think it's a pretty good nugget of wisdom.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
I've been with my girlfriend for three and a half years now, but for the past year, she

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
lived in different cities, so we had to go do the long-distance thing.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
I'm planning on proposing soon, and after that, she's going to be moving back to my city.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
The problem is, I've gotten incredibly used to this long-distance relationship.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
I've got a daily routine of work, taekwondo, dinner, and then playing games all night.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
When we were still in the same city, we didn't live together, so I still have my personal

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
space, but that's obviously going to change.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Do you guys, except Griffin, sorry buddy, find it hard to juggle your personal time

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
and your significant other?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
For love or StarCraft, the muffin.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
See, I just double down on my taekwondo time.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Just more taekwondo?

20:36.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah, yeah, I take my love cavity, and I just fill it with taekwondo.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
I'm going to hit you with something, the muffin, that's going to kind of blow your mind a little

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
bit.

20:50.000 --> 20:57.000
I was in the same boat you were, for a long time, because I've always been super into

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
to me time, to Justin time.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
The time that you spend by yourself is important, and I think you should still try to get that

21:06.000 --> 21:13.000
time, but keep in mind that the time you spend by yourself playing video games, for example,

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
taekwondo is not a great example because it's helping you be fitter, but playing games all

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
night, that is without context.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
It's time that it doesn't really edify you.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
You're the only one that it affects, and time that you spend with your significant other

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
has context.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
It has...

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Value?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Is that what you're saying?

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
Yeah, it's not value less, but it's about finding a balance.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
You've got to find a balance between the two, and don't...

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
You can always play video games.

21:55.000 --> 22:02.000
You can always do that stuff, but it's about finding a balance between the two.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Of course, it will change.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
Everything will change when you move in with someone and you live with someone, especially

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
when you marry someone, but change for the better, and if you find it changing not for

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
the better, it's as simple as having a discussion and saying, hey, I really love spending time

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
with you, but I do need some me time here and there.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Yeah, no girl will ever understand that.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Sorry, that won't work.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Well, she probably enjoys her me time, too.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
It's worth a shot, but I don't think that any...

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
I mean, maybe she does.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Maybe she will enjoy the me time.

22:37.000 --> 22:45.000
If she is a very not me time person, though, if you're like, I need some space, then it's

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
not going to go well, I don't think.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Okay, well, how about this idea?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Me time together.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Yeah.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Ooh, I like this.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
You play video games while she reads a book, but you're together, you're in the same room,

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
you're hanging out, but you don't have to be constantly staring into each other's eyes

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
for hours.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Deborah, I like you a lot.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I want to be together alone.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Can we do that?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
I want to be with you, but not with you.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
You sit over there.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
You sit over there, you do your crossword puzzle, and you drink your tea.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I'm going to be over here practicing my Quan.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I'm just getting my Quan on.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I'm getting my Quan on.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Do me a favor.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
Taekwon, don't talk to me for the next hour or so.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Can we work that out?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
We can.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
Just do anything else.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
You could try to get her hooked on something super addictive.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Take her out to Coke Beach.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
You won't see her for days.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
But yeah, I mean, it's just a balance, and it is going to change.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
But remember that, yeah, that's quality time.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
You'll find interest that you share.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
But it is, you're right.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
It's a huge adjustment.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
If it's too hard, get single again, my man.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Chuck it.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Chuck it back to the sea, you know?

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
Forget about it.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Luda!

24:09.000 --> 24:17.000
Get out the way, bitch.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
Griffin, you know what I need.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
This one is sent in by CurlyHeadPoet.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Thank you, CurlyHeadPoet.

24:24.000 --> 24:31.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amy, who asks, oh, man, does anyone know of any other grandpa names?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Oh, no.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
It can't.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Listen to the parameters, please.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Okay.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
All right.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
All right.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
It cannot be Poppy, Grandpa, or Pop Pop.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Gramps sounds like cramps.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Don't go there.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Don't.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Don't even.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Additional details.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
And please, no names in other languages.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
This is America We Speak English.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Did she say that?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Awesome.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Awesome.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
That's awesome.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Definitely.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Awesome, Amy.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Cool.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Any P vowel P.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Vowel.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Sound.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Yeah.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
You can.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
You're fine.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Like Pee Pee.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Well, maybe not that.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
No, not that.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
No.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Papo.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Papo.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
That's good.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Poppy.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Peepums.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
As long as there's two P's.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Go see your peepums.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
This is my peepums.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Darrell, go see your peepums.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
My peepums always has the hardest, crumbliest chewing gum.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Don't.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Now, Darrell, don't you eat peepum's nasty gum.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
You know what happened last time.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
Peepum's nasty gum sounds like a product that we should copyright immediately.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Oh, God.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
I just purchased a pack of peepum's old-timey nasty gum.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
You're still in the Juicy Fruit?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Oh, that's bitch gum.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
I'm into peepum's nasty gum.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Fuck your fruit stripes.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
The thing about peepum's nasty gum is that you have to put the emphasis on a different

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
syllable every time you say it.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Peepum's not even good?

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Oh, peepum's not even good with that nasty gum.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It's just a lot of the care for it.

26:19.000 --> 26:33.000
Peepum's nasty gum is obviously the greatest thing any of us have ever said, but let's

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
give this person some much-needed help.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
I'm going to decide that grand peepum's is the best name ever.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
I like that, because you can expand on that.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
You can have a great grand peepum's without great gum gum.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
It should be noted that gum's not going to get you better.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
What about Propu?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Propum?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Propur?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Propy?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Propy?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
That sounds like an alien grandfather.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Propy.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Proteus.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
I'm proteus the peepums.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I'm a peepum's proteus.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Please eat my nasty spray scope.

27:11.000 --> 27:19.000
Are there any non-double P names that still work?

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
For some reason, and this is so cultural, I guess, but for some reason when you pull

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
away from P's it doesn't feel like a grandpa name.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
You have to have the P in there somewhere, right?

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
There's probably some sort of root language explanation there, like paternal.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Maybe paternal has something to do with it.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
I guess granddad does it, but who says granddad?

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
That sounds like something you only refer to them as after they're dead.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
This is my granddad.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Granddad?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
That's depressing.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Yeah.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
What about master father?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Whoa!

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
This is master dad.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I was thinking master dad.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
What if the problem isn't the dad or the pop, but the grand?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
What if we could switch the grand?

28:01.000 --> 28:08.000
No, but think about the one removed, and you can say this is my great grandmaster dad.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
What about progenitor prime?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
How do you feel about that?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
How about just Philip?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
No one calls him an adult.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah, just call him by his name, which is even better if you're six.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
He's like, would you like a Werther's?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
You're like, yes, Robert.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
I would enjoy a Werther's.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Thank you, Robert.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Thank you, Robert.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Gum?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
No, I don't think so.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I would prefer not to have it.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
The Werther's will keep, sir.

28:35.000 --> 28:44.000
Unlike your nasty gum that I believe retrieved from a package of baseball cards circa 1987, peepums.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
What if we did it like Japanese math, and we just called him like daddy dad?

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Or dad dad.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Just like expand it to whatever power.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I feel like that would be a much shit.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
I just revolutionized the whole fucking system.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
It's much better now.

29:00.000 --> 29:07.000
We got rid of all these arbitrary titles, and we just expanded it based on how they actually relate to your nuclear family.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Yes.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
Your cousin will be your dad's sister's son.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
So you want to de-simplify the language, and instead of one word like cousin.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
No, because who the fuck can keep cousins straight?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Especially once you get to second or third cousins, who knows?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Who knows?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
It's very nebulous.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
I'm saying we simplify the entire thing, and we just go dad sister brother.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Or I guess that would be your dad again.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Do you understand what I'm saying though?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Uh-huh.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
I do.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It's just like so terrible of an idea.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I don't want to encourage you more.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
The one thing I was thinking is I talk about my extended family in public too much.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
I wish there was some way to complicate it to keep me from bringing them up all the time.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Oh, I know.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Dad sister brother.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Would you call them that to their face?

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
No, I would call them by their name.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
This is my mom brother.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
His name is Tom.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
This is my mom brother Tom.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Peabam's Nasty Gum.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I just want to get that out there one more time.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.000
It's too bad the mixtape just came out, because I feel like we could get an entire selection out of Peabam's Nasty Gum.

30:13.000 --> 30:24.000
My wife started knitting four years ago, and that was all fine and swell until she started wearing her creations.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
How can I tell her that I don't like it when she wears these creations without hurting her feelings?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
That's from hip hobo.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
There's nothing hip about being inconsiderate.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Oh, wow.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Burn.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I don't like it when you wear that sweater.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
You know what?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
It doesn't matter if she made it or not.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
That's not your call to make.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
You should never say that.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Don't ever say that.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Unless.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Unless.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
She's really bad at knitting.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
You can see through it, and you see all her face.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
Unless we have underestimated her terribleness at knitting.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Hey, listen.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Yeah?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I like that sweater.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
She's a terrible knitter, and you can see.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
It's like, I like your sexy shirt, but I can't have you wearing that in public.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Is that sexy?

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
Sexy if you can see through the yard, see some nipple, I guess.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
I don't know.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Maybe.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
You can see your hungry, hungry nipples?

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
That only happens in sitcoms.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
I don't think it happens in real life.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
You don't do it.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Ask to borrow her stuff, and then lose it.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
No, because she worked hard on that.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Don't be a guy.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
No, that's, no.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
No, no.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Don't take Travis's path of least thought.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
You should, you should, like, just keep it to yourself.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Dude, it doesn't matter.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Trust me.

31:39.000 --> 31:47.000
There's no situation in which your distaste for her clothing is going to be, like, harder

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
to handle than just her scorn.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Just her deep resentment.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
I have it.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I got it.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Oh, good.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
No, I figured it out.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
You're really good this time, right?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
It's not going to be, is it burn it?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Because that's not going to fly away.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Nope, nope.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Okay.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
No, this is a good one.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Encourage her to sell her creations.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Whoa.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Whoa.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Then she can't wear them, because she's got to sell them.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
From downtown.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Travis.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Yeah.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Why are you wearing money?

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
You're going to stain that, and we won't be able to make a living off of it.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Take that off right now, and never wear it again.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
We beg it.

32:17.000 --> 32:22.920
Do you think Etsy actually got started when some husband was like, dude, that scarf, are

32:22.920 --> 32:23.920
you serious?

32:23.920 --> 32:25.880
You can't wear that.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.640
Let's go ahead and give that one to internet, and...

32:28.640 --> 32:29.640
Yeah.

32:29.640 --> 32:30.640
Now you get money.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.780
Man, Travis, I'm sorry for doubting you.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.420
That's a slam dunk.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.160
You should tell her to sell it, but sell that one.

32:37.160 --> 32:40.240
You have to say, like, this one is very special.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.240
I think you should sell it right now.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.240
You've already worn it.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.960
You've filled it with your memories.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.400
Now let's go ahead and give it to the world.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.240
Let's sell your memories on Etsy.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.800
Ask her to knit me something.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.320
I've only had knit things for me one time.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.160
I only have one knit thing.

32:57.160 --> 33:03.840
Somebody knit me a peepum's nasty gum toboggan.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.840
I would just want a peepum's nasty gum koozie.

33:05.840 --> 33:09.520
Yeah, to keep your peepum's nasty gum warm.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.080
I want a nasty gum holster.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.440
A knitted nasty gum holster.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.320
I just... That's slick Rick.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.000
He's the slickest nasty gum dealer in the West.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.640
You look at him wrong, he'll throw two pieces of nasty gum.

33:21.640 --> 33:27.080
I'm worried because we obviously had a lot of nasty gum in our youth because we had grandparents

33:27.080 --> 33:30.980
that handed out nasty gum, but I'm worried that not everybody got to experience the nasty

33:30.980 --> 33:31.980
gum phenomenon.

33:31.980 --> 33:34.160
I'm pretty sure this is a universal thing.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.160
Is it?

33:35.160 --> 33:38.960
It's like, for those who didn't receive nasty gum from their parents, or their grandparents,

33:38.960 --> 33:45.520
it's like the gum that comes in Mike Topps baseball cards packages.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.640
It's just crumbly ass terrible nasty gum.

33:47.640 --> 33:51.840
Yeah, you take a bite out of it and it shatters and disintegrates into a billion pieces.

33:51.840 --> 33:56.040
I can't believe nasty gum communicates the whole experience like it's nasty gum.

33:56.040 --> 34:00.720
In fact, I feel like we're actually siphoning a little bit of magic away from the word.

34:00.720 --> 34:03.120
Yeah, you'll edit this out later, right?

34:03.120 --> 34:04.120
Nah.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.540
Yeah, okay.

34:05.540 --> 34:08.320
Is calling someone a nerd considered an insult?

34:08.320 --> 34:13.680
I've called him a BF a nerd on several occasions, and he thinks I'm downing on him.

34:13.680 --> 34:14.680
But come on!

34:14.680 --> 34:17.760
His favorite things are video games, Star Wars, and bacon.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.080
Please help a girl out.

34:20.080 --> 34:25.240
I don't have a problem when people call me a nerd or when people call other people a

34:25.240 --> 34:33.920
nerd, but when people call themselves a nerd, I get the strongest douche chills.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.240
It's pretty bad.

34:35.240 --> 34:38.440
I feel the same way when people call themselves a jock.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.440
Yeah.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.440
It's like-

34:40.440 --> 34:41.440
Anybody who just-

34:41.440 --> 34:42.440
God, it bugs me.

34:42.440 --> 34:47.080
So forwardly just like picks a label and is like, I am slut.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.080
What's up?

34:48.080 --> 34:49.080
Yeah.

34:49.080 --> 34:52.180
Or when it's, you know, the one that bothers me, regional.

34:52.180 --> 34:53.480
I'm an Arkansas girl.

34:53.480 --> 34:54.480
What do you want?

34:54.480 --> 34:55.480
Oh, fuck you.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.480
Yeah.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.480
Seriously.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.480
That is so New York.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.480
That's-

34:59.480 --> 35:00.480
Ugh.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.480
I feel like we've gotten off topic.

35:01.480 --> 35:02.480
Okay.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.480
You know what else?

35:03.480 --> 35:04.480
Is nerd an insult?

35:04.480 --> 35:08.200
It's like coffee out of the grinder and it's all stuck in there.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.200
Ugh.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.200
Yeah.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.360
Now we're showing them.

35:12.360 --> 35:16.520
You know, if he considers it an insult, that's the, I guess that's the, I mean, like, if

35:16.520 --> 35:21.200
you know that and you keep saying it, then yeah, I think you're participating in this.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.280
I don't think you can claim ignorance too long.

35:23.280 --> 35:28.160
I can't formulate a sentence in which calling someone a nerd is a compliment.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.560
Like you're such a great nerd.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.560
Yeah.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.920
Even when you say it with like the best intentions, you're still being a little condescending,

35:34.920 --> 35:35.920
I think.

35:35.920 --> 35:36.920
Yeah.

35:36.920 --> 35:40.800
You're putting someone, you're labeling someone and that's never, that's never true.

35:40.800 --> 35:44.980
You're saying, you're basically saying the things you care about are not significant

35:44.980 --> 35:50.120
or important to the, the large, the larger tapestry that is our world.

35:50.120 --> 35:55.480
Uh, my advice to your boyfriend, next time Elisa says you're a nerd, look her dead in

35:55.480 --> 35:59.920
the eye and say, I prefer to think of myself as Otaku.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.920
I can't wait for her to leave you.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.560
You'll never have that, you'll never have that problem again.

36:05.560 --> 36:06.560
Solved.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.160
I'm literally shivering right now.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.160
I know.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.560
I am Otaku.

36:10.560 --> 36:11.560
I prefer.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.680
That would be awesome.

36:12.680 --> 36:17.520
I wish we, hey, I don't know who your boyfriend is, but I wish we could give him advice instead

36:17.520 --> 36:22.080
of you because we would tell him to just like double his nerdiness quotient.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.080
Double down.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.800
Make your kids smoke and, and, and double down on it.

36:25.800 --> 36:29.560
Just double down and like start, uh, listening to nothing.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.320
Nothing but J-pop.

36:31.320 --> 36:37.700
Like just listen to the weirdest Japanese pop you can find, uh, do a little cosplay,

36:37.700 --> 36:38.700
get really into steampunk.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.280
Did I make something sense?

36:40.280 --> 36:42.040
When is bacon nerdy?

36:42.040 --> 36:43.040
I think bacon's nerdy.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.080
I think we've been, I think bacon is nerdy.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.080
Yeah.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.640
Bacon went around the bend.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.640
Yeah.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.640
Sorry.

36:49.640 --> 36:50.800
I mean, you're still, you can still be on bacon.

36:50.800 --> 36:51.800
Like you can still.

36:51.800 --> 36:52.800
Yeah.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.800
Like bacon.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.360
Uh, what do we have time for?

36:55.360 --> 36:58.000
Got another Yahoo on the, on the docket.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Sure.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Okay.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.240
Um, this one, uh, was sent in by Cal.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.240
Thank you, Cal.

37:04.240 --> 37:10.760
It's by, it's by Yahoo answers user, the Christ puncher.

37:10.760 --> 37:11.760
Okay.

37:11.760 --> 37:12.760
Cool.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.760
Cool.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
Okay.

37:14.760 --> 37:15.760
Okay.

37:15.760 --> 37:23.440
The Christ puncher asks, what is a good quick way to make money from my dog?

37:23.440 --> 37:25.280
My dog is expensive.

37:25.280 --> 37:29.720
Usually we just feed her table scraps, bits of hamburger, onion rings, fries, extra ketchup

37:29.720 --> 37:31.720
packets, et cetera.

37:31.720 --> 37:32.720
Wait, what?

37:32.720 --> 37:33.720
Excuse me?

37:33.720 --> 37:38.120
Uh, but things are getting tight financially around my house and we need every, every family

37:38.120 --> 37:40.960
member to pull their own weight when it comes to expenses, even food.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.080
My dog is pure bred and not fixed.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.480
I was wondering how much I could make from a litter of puppies and how long they take

37:46.480 --> 37:48.000
to gestate.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.280
If this isn't a good idea, some suggestions on other ways for my dog to start earning

37:52.280 --> 37:54.880
money would be appreciated.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.640
I think you could just make him find his own ketchup packets.

37:57.640 --> 37:58.640
Right?

37:58.640 --> 38:05.360
How, how fucking tight is it getting when you can't give your dog table scraps anymore?

38:05.360 --> 38:06.360
You just don't have them.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.760
You, you give your toddler a bone to gnaw on.

38:09.760 --> 38:13.360
Hey, get the, I am eating every onion ring.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.840
I'm eating all of these.

38:14.840 --> 38:21.000
Um, I mean that the quickest, easiest option I guess would be to turn him into a celebri

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
dog.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Right?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Like get him his own features.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.120
I'm pretty sure that, um, George Lopez has started casting for Beverly Hills, Chihuahua

38:27.120 --> 38:28.120
two.

38:28.120 --> 38:32.280
Um, Justin, give me a set title for that movie where you're not aware that that movie already

38:32.280 --> 38:33.280
exists.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.280
Does it really?

38:34.280 --> 38:35.280
Yeah.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.280
I shit you not.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.280
I don't think it's true to the Google.

38:37.280 --> 38:42.760
Uh, Beverly Hills, oh my fuck.

38:42.760 --> 38:43.760
Fuck.

38:43.760 --> 38:44.760
Yeah.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.760
Yeah.

38:45.760 --> 38:46.760
Fuck.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.760
It's out.

38:47.760 --> 38:48.760
It's out on Blu-ray.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.760
So you could get your, you could get your dog on Beverly Hills, Chihuahua three.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.000
Can we stop the show?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Trace, Trace Perros.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.880
Oh, Ernie Hudson was in that film.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.880
Good.

39:00.880 --> 39:01.880
Oh good.

39:01.880 --> 39:04.280
Like Ernie Hudson didn't have enough to deal with on a day to day basis.

39:04.280 --> 39:09.560
Ernie Hudson, Ernie Hudson and Olivia Newton John?

39:09.560 --> 39:11.080
That's a tour de force.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.560
Oh fuck.

39:12.560 --> 39:16.040
Were you out in theaters for Beverly Hills, Chihuahua two?

39:16.040 --> 39:18.400
Did G-Lo make time for that one?

39:18.400 --> 39:21.000
Oh man.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Tell me.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.720
French Stewart was in the mix.

39:23.720 --> 39:28.400
Oh, French Stewart makes me so sad.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.400
Not funny.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.400
Open your eyes, French Stewart.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.400
See where your life is headed.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.400
Stop squinting, stupid.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.400
You're running into oblivion.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.400
Open your eyes.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.400
Your agent is a fax machine.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.400
Get out of there.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.400
Stop squinting, you bastard.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.400
Oh, stupid French Stewart.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.400
I miss that guy, though.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.400
He probably is a listener.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.400
Doesn't make sense.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.400
I don't know.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.400
I don't know.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.400
I don't know.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.400
I don't know.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.400
I don't know.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.400
I don't know.

39:47.400 --> 39:48.400
I don't know.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.400
I don't know.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.400
I don't know.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.400
I don't know.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
I don't know.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
I don't know.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.400
I want to go make Inspector Gadget four.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.400
French Stewart.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
I want to go make Inspector Gadget four.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.400
French Stewart.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.200
I want to go make Inspector Gadget four.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.200
French Stewart.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.200
God, I'm a bitch.

40:01.200 --> 40:09.960
I want to punch the squint right out of this stupid face.

40:09.960 --> 40:13.920
Oh, god.

40:13.920 --> 40:14.920
This coffee is strong.

40:14.920 --> 40:15.920
It is.

40:15.920 --> 40:16.920
I'm wired now.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.540
I'll punch French Stewart in the face.

40:19.540 --> 40:22.500
Tell me if George Lopez was in Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 or not.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.500
Oh, fuck yeah.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.620
Of course he was.

40:24.620 --> 40:25.620
Did this come in theaters?

40:25.620 --> 40:28.300
In fact, I don't think that- I'm almost certain it didn't.

40:28.300 --> 40:32.260
I don't think that George Lopez, like, arranged shit in any way.

40:32.260 --> 40:36.220
I think he probably just did one of the voices, but I like to imagine him as the puppet master.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.220
No.

40:37.220 --> 40:42.900
I like to imagine that they just record him saying things in his day-to-day life and work

40:42.900 --> 40:43.900
it into a film.

40:43.900 --> 40:44.900
You think?

40:44.900 --> 40:45.900
Yeah.

40:45.900 --> 40:46.900
Yeah, definitely.

40:46.900 --> 40:47.940
And Fred Stewart's like, no, I can work with this.

40:47.940 --> 40:48.940
This is good.

40:48.940 --> 40:50.460
Yeah, I'll pass the salt, George.

40:50.460 --> 40:53.620
Like, it's- God, man, I do hate Fred Stewart.

40:53.620 --> 40:58.540
He depresses me, though, because he was- he was so good, and if you looked at Fred Stewart

40:58.540 --> 41:02.180
and Joseph Gordon-Levitt on Third Rock and said, which one of these dudes is going places,

41:02.180 --> 41:04.260
I wouldn't have guessed Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.260
But there he is.

41:05.260 --> 41:06.260
Making it big.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.260
Making it huge.

41:07.260 --> 41:09.820
He incepted the hell out of that movie.

41:09.820 --> 41:10.820
Oh, God.

41:10.820 --> 41:18.780
I seriously, like, my- my fucking drive to do the show, to do the show, to do the show

41:18.780 --> 41:20.220
anymore is totally gone.

41:20.220 --> 41:23.580
Like, when you guys were talking for the past couple minutes, I just was- I was just reading

41:23.580 --> 41:24.580
this IMDB page.

41:24.580 --> 41:25.580
For Fred Stewart?

41:25.580 --> 41:26.580
For- for- for- for Chihuahua 2?

41:26.580 --> 41:27.580
For Bev- for Bev 2.

41:27.580 --> 41:28.580
Bev 2?

41:28.580 --> 41:29.580
Is there any ratings?

41:29.580 --> 41:30.580
Are there any user reviews?

41:30.580 --> 41:42.660
Can we advise people on whether or not they should see Chihuahua 2?

41:42.660 --> 41:43.660
It's actually not out yet.

41:43.660 --> 41:44.660
Okay, thank God.

41:44.660 --> 41:47.860
Yeah, yeah, it's- it's got a release date of February 6th.

41:47.860 --> 41:48.860
I'll be there.

41:48.860 --> 41:49.860
It says-

41:49.860 --> 41:50.860
I'll be there.

41:50.860 --> 41:51.860
Oh, God.

41:51.860 --> 41:52.860
It says France on the page.

41:52.860 --> 41:53.860
No, no, no.

41:53.860 --> 41:54.860
French.

41:54.860 --> 41:55.860
That's a common misconception.

41:55.860 --> 41:56.860
French.

41:56.860 --> 41:57.860
French Stewart.

41:57.860 --> 42:00.260
It's a common misconception.

42:00.260 --> 42:01.260
None of this is usable.

42:01.260 --> 42:03.460
None of this is usable material.

42:03.460 --> 42:04.460
What?

42:04.460 --> 42:05.460
For the show?

42:05.460 --> 42:06.460
Yes.

42:06.460 --> 42:07.460
Or for life.

42:07.460 --> 42:08.460
French Stewart, you're not-

42:08.460 --> 42:09.940
I think we can all learn something from French Stewart.

42:09.940 --> 42:13.860
That's probably what director Alex Zam said when he went over the final cut of Beverly

42:13.860 --> 42:14.860
Hill's Chihuahua 2.

42:14.860 --> 42:15.860
French.

42:15.860 --> 42:16.860
It's the Zamster.

42:16.860 --> 42:17.860
Listen.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.180
We gotta get these contracts inked.

42:19.180 --> 42:26.460
I want you as Squinty the Squinting- I want you as Squinty the Seeing Eye Dog.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.860
They'll be rolling in the aisles.

42:27.860 --> 42:32.100
Did you say- did you say rolling in the- they'll be rolling in the aisles, French.

42:32.100 --> 42:34.860
It'll be a laughter unlike you've heard in years.

42:34.860 --> 42:35.860
I've seen.

42:35.860 --> 42:36.860
Not since- not since IG2.

42:36.860 --> 42:37.860
Not since The Shredder Gadget 2.

42:37.860 --> 42:38.860
Well, you've heard that laugh.

42:38.860 --> 42:45.780
Now, I'm not the only one with French Stewart's IMDb page open right now, I think.

42:45.780 --> 42:46.780
Are you kidding?

42:46.780 --> 42:47.780
I'm not from Hart.

42:47.780 --> 42:49.900
I know- I know French Stewart's history.

42:49.900 --> 42:53.660
Third Rock, IG2, Chihuahua, DOS.

42:53.660 --> 42:54.660
I know his whole thing.

42:54.660 --> 42:55.660
Unemployment.

42:55.660 --> 42:56.660
Six months.

42:56.660 --> 42:57.660
Unemployment.

42:57.660 --> 42:58.660
Considering suicide.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.660
Last three years.

42:59.660 --> 43:02.500
Well, it actually says all of this on his IMDb page, too, which is weird.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.300
It is on the- well, he adds- he updates it himself.

43:05.300 --> 43:06.980
What the fuck else is he gonna do?

43:06.980 --> 43:10.860
He has this keyboard with the giant keys on it, because he can't see that well, obviously.

43:10.860 --> 43:12.980
He's squinting all the time.

43:12.980 --> 43:13.980
Where's the G?

43:13.980 --> 43:14.980
I've- I've turned a corner.

43:14.980 --> 43:16.980
I feel bad now.

43:16.980 --> 43:18.620
I feel bad for French Stewart now.

43:18.620 --> 43:21.980
I'm gonna- next week, all pro-French Stewart material.

43:21.980 --> 43:22.980
It's guaranteed.

43:22.980 --> 43:26.060
We- So, I wanna hear Griffin's-

43:26.060 --> 43:29.820
We haven't- we haven't not answered a question as hard as we didn't answer that question,

43:29.820 --> 43:32.520
I think, in the history of the show.

43:32.520 --> 43:36.780
It's the hardest non-answer that we've ever- that we've ever given.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.980
Let's do one more real one before we get out of here.

43:38.980 --> 43:39.980
Okay.

43:39.980 --> 43:44.940
I finally convinced a friend to join the MBMBA nation, so this question is for her benefit.

43:44.940 --> 43:51.900
She recently moved from NYC to Ohio and is now being inundated with wang pics from guys

43:51.900 --> 43:56.220
that get her number now and from several internet friends.

43:56.220 --> 44:00.180
She's shy and swears she is not soliciting them in any way.

44:00.180 --> 44:01.540
What can she do?

44:01.540 --> 44:02.540
T-Rex.

44:02.540 --> 44:03.540
Wait.

44:03.540 --> 44:04.540
What?

44:04.540 --> 44:06.740
I don't understand this question.

44:06.740 --> 44:07.740
Excuse me?

44:07.740 --> 44:13.660
She moved from New York to Ohio and somewhere in that-

44:13.660 --> 44:16.300
She passed some cell phone tower.

44:16.300 --> 44:21.940
There is some tower that relayed her phone number to- to wang mailers everywhere.

44:21.940 --> 44:23.340
Yeah, to this shadowy organization.

44:23.340 --> 44:28.340
And what I love is this is not one or two wang pics, she's being inundated with wang

44:28.340 --> 44:29.340
pics.

44:29.340 --> 44:30.340
Flooded.

44:30.340 --> 44:31.340
Just flooded with constant stream.

44:31.340 --> 44:33.340
An embarrassment of dick shots.

44:33.340 --> 44:35.700
I am- I am rolling in it.

44:35.700 --> 44:41.260
She can jump like Scrooge McDuck into her big mountain of wang pictures.

44:41.260 --> 44:44.780
I don't know- I'm not familiar with enough cell phone technology to understand how this

44:44.780 --> 44:46.460
could happen to somebody.

44:46.460 --> 44:52.260
I guess she could always get her- she could disable picture messages.

44:52.260 --> 44:53.620
Is that a possibility?

44:53.620 --> 44:58.140
No, we need to go deeper in this because I understand, like, sending the wrong signals

44:58.140 --> 45:01.540
to one, maybe two guys.

45:01.540 --> 45:03.780
What is she doing?

45:03.780 --> 45:09.500
What if there's- what if someone- an ex-boyfriend that she left high and dry in New York wrote

45:09.500 --> 45:11.860
on a wall like- Oh, that has to be it.

45:11.860 --> 45:14.020
It has to be- I heart wang pics dot com.

45:14.020 --> 45:15.700
Yeah, I need your dick pics.

45:15.700 --> 45:17.740
Send them- send them to me.

45:17.740 --> 45:18.740
Yeah.

45:18.740 --> 45:20.380
And when you need something, it's a responsibility.

45:20.380 --> 45:25.740
I think, um, there's a lot of things you can do with this, but, um, my solution is you

45:25.740 --> 45:30.700
take those dick pics, uh, and you forward them to other people who are sending you dick

45:30.700 --> 45:31.700
pics.

45:31.700 --> 45:32.700
You- you- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:32.700 --> 45:36.460
Just, like, someone sends you a picture of a dick and you send them back a picture of

45:36.460 --> 45:37.460
somebody else's dick.

45:37.460 --> 45:38.460
No, no, no.

45:38.460 --> 45:40.060
You send them fifty pictures of their dick.

45:40.060 --> 45:41.060
Oh, I love it.

45:41.060 --> 45:44.460
You're gonna make your- you're gonna make your kid smoke and give them fifty pictures

45:44.460 --> 45:45.460
of dick.

45:45.460 --> 45:47.180
Hey, do you like dick pics so much?

45:47.180 --> 45:49.140
Let me give you some in return.

45:49.140 --> 45:54.660
Or every time someone sends you a dick picture, just text back, I sent that to your mom.

45:54.660 --> 45:57.340
They won't- they won't know what hit them.

45:57.340 --> 46:02.420
Or, uh, maybe she doesn't- maybe since your friend's a girl, she probably loves it.

46:02.420 --> 46:03.420
What girl wouldn't love that, right?

46:03.420 --> 46:04.420
Pictures of- pictures of wieners?

46:04.420 --> 46:07.660
It's like, uh, she's- just pictures of wieners every day.

46:07.660 --> 46:09.860
That's what girls crave, right?

46:09.860 --> 46:11.780
Like they- No, it's the crazy crunch that girls crave.

46:11.780 --> 46:14.540
I- I totally, totally agree with you there.

46:14.540 --> 46:18.220
She can't- it's like a water faucet she can't shut off, but why would she want to?

46:18.220 --> 46:19.220
Yeah.

46:19.220 --> 46:20.220
Cause it's- cause the water is dick pics.

46:20.220 --> 46:21.220
Cause it's wet.

46:21.220 --> 46:22.220
Yeah.

46:22.220 --> 46:24.900
You just want to wash your hands with dick pics.

46:24.900 --> 46:31.580
Uh, yeah, I- I- I, uh, I feel like we've given you several action- action items ranging

46:31.580 --> 46:33.980
from possible to, uh, to whimsical.

46:33.980 --> 46:35.420
Uh, so- I don't know.

46:35.420 --> 46:39.100
I feel like creating a vault of dick pictures and swimming around it, I feel like we- we

46:39.100 --> 46:40.100
hit a high point there.

46:40.100 --> 46:42.860
Oh, tell her to release a book.

46:42.860 --> 46:44.660
Things- things my wang says.

46:44.660 --> 46:48.820
Uh, do a blog, put a Tumblr blog- Chicken soup for the wang pixel.

46:48.820 --> 46:50.300
Eat- eat prey wang?

46:50.300 --> 46:52.100
Eat prey wang!

46:52.100 --> 46:54.060
This is my- this is my novelty book.

46:54.060 --> 46:55.300
It's a gift book.

46:55.300 --> 46:57.260
Eat prey wang, $18 at Borders.

46:57.260 --> 46:58.740
There are only 60 pages.

46:58.740 --> 47:00.300
The girl- the girl with the dragon wang?

47:00.300 --> 47:05.380
Why don't you make a- why- I- I think a blog- I think a- make a Tumblr blog, and then just

47:05.380 --> 47:09.580
as soon as they send you the dick pic, you send them back the URL of the blog where you

47:09.580 --> 47:11.180
just put the dick pic up.

47:11.180 --> 47:12.180
Yup.

47:12.180 --> 47:13.180
You'll never see that coming.

47:13.180 --> 47:16.980
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but, um, first, couple real quick housekeeping

47:16.980 --> 47:17.980
things.

47:17.980 --> 47:24.660
MBMBAM.com is your- is your source, is your one-stop shop, your- your dick pic faucet,

47:24.660 --> 47:27.980
uh, as it were, of MBMBAM information.

47:27.980 --> 47:33.300
You can go there to, uh, send us, uh, questions.

47:33.300 --> 47:37.500
Our, uh, uh, our email address is there, we've got an automatic form where you can send in

47:37.500 --> 47:44.300
stuff, um, the Magic 8 Ball may be carrying over with us to the new MaxFun site, it may

47:44.300 --> 47:49.740
not be, so you might want to get your- your clicks in, uh, uh, today.

47:49.740 --> 47:53.900
You will, at some point in the near future, notice that it has switched over to- to MaxFun,

47:53.900 --> 47:56.900
um, but you know, everything you love will still be there, and we're gonna try to do

47:56.900 --> 48:04.180
more posts, uh, there on the Mac- on the MBMBAM, uh, blog, more stuff from us, just, you know,

48:04.180 --> 48:05.180
randomness, um.

48:05.180 --> 48:08.420
You'll definitely- definitely be able to find the- the download link for the My Brother,

48:08.420 --> 48:12.060
My Brother and Me mixtape up on there, um, we'll try and get that out right around the

48:12.060 --> 48:13.540
show time release.

48:13.540 --> 48:20.680
Uh, show time release, yes, um, also go to the forums, uh, MaximumFun.org, click on forums

48:20.680 --> 48:25.120
and go there and talk about this episode, say how much you loved it, um, and tell-

48:25.120 --> 48:27.700
While you're there, check out all their other wonderful podcasts.

48:27.700 --> 48:29.700
Oh my god, get down on them.

48:29.700 --> 48:33.220
Whoa, that was a very emphatic endorsement.

48:33.220 --> 48:34.980
Just stop our podcast right now.

48:34.980 --> 48:40.780
Yeah, just stop podcasting us, and start- stop podcasting yourself, I guess.

48:40.780 --> 48:43.340
Um, I see I turned that around.

48:43.340 --> 48:44.340
I heard it, it's good.

48:44.340 --> 48:45.340
No, I see what you did.

48:45.340 --> 48:46.340
It was good, right?

48:46.340 --> 48:52.140
Um, not too much, not too much, um, but yeah, thank you guys so much, uh, the response from-

48:52.140 --> 48:57.420
from you new MaxFun folks has been absolutely, uh, delightful and positive, and we really

48:57.420 --> 48:58.420
appreciate it.

48:58.420 --> 49:02.180
Um, if you get a chance this week, if you heard something funny on the show, you wanna

49:02.180 --> 49:08.100
tweet about it with the MBMBAM hashtag, uh, we love that, it's- I- I have a search that

49:08.100 --> 49:13.260
is open an embarrassing amount of time that I am constantly monitoring, uh, and I- and

49:13.260 --> 49:17.940
I always appreciate those, and, um, it's a good way to get people interested.

49:17.940 --> 49:23.380
I would like to throw out, um, French Stewart, if you are listening- Oh, I'm so sorry!

49:23.380 --> 49:27.460
Ah, it's so, so sorry, um, big fans.

49:27.460 --> 49:28.460
Just big fans.

49:28.460 --> 49:29.460
Huge fans.

49:29.460 --> 49:30.460
Um.

49:30.460 --> 49:31.460
Uh, who was out there?

49:31.460 --> 49:36.900
This- Wyn Myself, uh, W-Y-N-N-E Myself, uh, out there, he just listened to his first

49:36.900 --> 49:37.900
episode.

49:37.900 --> 49:41.060
He started at E1, uh, Meg Balls, out there- Shoulda done that.

49:41.060 --> 49:42.060
Shoulda done that.

49:42.060 --> 49:45.140
Nah, shouldn't start at one, but- Start at the top and work back, and stop

49:45.140 --> 49:46.140
at, like, maybe six.

49:46.140 --> 49:50.660
But yeah, this is- this is, uh, this is- this is a lot of fun, guys, and thank you

49:50.660 --> 49:54.460
to you two, as always, uh, for- for doing the show with me.

49:54.460 --> 49:55.460
I really appreciate it.

49:55.460 --> 49:56.460
Hey, you're welcome.

49:56.460 --> 49:57.460
You're welcome.

49:57.460 --> 49:58.460
Hey.

49:58.460 --> 49:59.460
It's the least I can do.

49:59.460 --> 50:00.460
Give me one to grow on.

50:00.460 --> 50:01.460
Sure.

50:01.460 --> 50:08.100
Uh, our last Yahoo question of the day is not actually a Yahoo question, but a news

50:08.100 --> 50:11.700
item from the Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 IMDB page.

50:11.700 --> 50:17.420
It reads, you wanted it, Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 sneak peek.

50:17.420 --> 50:21.460
Hitting DVD and Blu-ray on February 1, 2011 comes Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2, the sequel

50:21.460 --> 50:23.220
to your favorite film of 2008.

50:23.220 --> 50:24.220
Was it?

50:24.220 --> 50:27.620
You asked for more, and you got it, and I have a four-minute and forty-nine-second

50:27.620 --> 50:30.460
sneak peek for you directly below, but be careful.

50:30.460 --> 50:32.440
February is two months out.

50:32.440 --> 50:36.140
Maybe only watch this one in one-minute intervals so you don't burst from anticipation.

50:36.140 --> 50:38.860
Who's in this one?

50:38.860 --> 50:44.460
While they were able to get George Lopez back to lead, uh, to voice the lead Chihuahua Poppy,

50:44.460 --> 50:48.060
the same can't be said for Drew Barrymore as the voice of Chloe, but they got the next

50:48.060 --> 50:49.060
best thing.

50:49.060 --> 50:52.300
Odette Yusman of You Again fame, also starring our-

50:52.300 --> 50:54.040
What next best thing?

50:54.040 --> 50:58.720
Also starring our Zachary Gordon, Christine Lakin, and IMDB even has Ernie Hudson of

50:58.720 --> 51:01.060
Ghostbusters fame as part of the cast.

51:01.060 --> 51:05.820
Perhaps he saw it as an opportunity to do a little press and try and stir up more buzz

51:05.820 --> 51:10.180
for that much-bally-hooed Ghostbusters 3 feature.

51:10.180 --> 51:13.940
No one was talking about Ghostbusters 3, but now that Ernie Hudson was in Beverly Hills

51:13.940 --> 51:17.980
Chihuahua 2 on DVD, I really feel like we got some fucking heat.

51:17.980 --> 51:19.980
Like we're finally heating up.

51:19.980 --> 51:22.540
Hi, this is Bill Murray.

51:22.540 --> 51:23.540
Did I hear right?

51:23.540 --> 51:26.060
Ernie Hudson is in Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2?

51:26.060 --> 51:27.060
Direct-

51:27.060 --> 51:28.060
Sign me up.

51:28.060 --> 51:29.060
Sign me up.

51:29.060 --> 51:30.060
It's got heat now.

51:30.060 --> 51:31.060
I want that Hudson heat.

51:31.060 --> 51:32.960
I'll do an actual Yahoo answer now.

51:32.960 --> 51:33.960
This one was sent in by Cal.

51:33.960 --> 51:34.960
Thank you, Cal.

51:34.960 --> 51:43.340
It's by Yahoo answer's user Ronnie the MLK of GWS.

51:43.340 --> 51:49.620
He asks, why is it illegal to steal someone's horse or a parakeet but it's perfectly legal

51:49.620 --> 51:55.180
to steal someone's girlfriend?

51:55.180 --> 51:57.580
I'm Ernie Hudson.

51:57.580 --> 51:58.580
I'm French too.

51:58.580 --> 51:59.580
