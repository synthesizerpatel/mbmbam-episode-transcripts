00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.440
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother-mean-advice show for the modern era.

00:47.440 --> 00:52.160
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.560
I'm your baby brother, Griffin. Griffin, you sound so powerful.

00:56.560 --> 01:02.720
I have standing energy. Yes! My desk has transformed into its most

01:02.720 --> 01:07.040
healthful manifestation, and now I have standing energy.

01:07.600 --> 01:13.120
I too am standing. We all are standing for this one.

01:13.120 --> 01:19.600
I've got full-blown Peter Pan arms. I'm doing JoJo poses with my patio door

01:19.600 --> 01:25.040
curtain open so the street can see me, and also I've never watched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

01:25.040 --> 01:31.040
My lungs are filling with oxygen. My diaphragm feels in line.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.000
Is that something? Fuck yeah, it's something, Travis.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.320
It's standing energy. Whoa.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.240
I feel like my entire life, I've just been whispering.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.960
Yes. Do you hear this voice?

01:42.960 --> 01:45.520
This is my true voice. Whoa!

01:45.520 --> 01:49.440
I've been speaking with a hidden voice until this moment.

01:49.440 --> 01:54.240
This is my true voice. It's Justin's standing voice.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.520
It's my true voice. It's so musically delicious.

01:57.520 --> 02:02.480
Soon you boys will get your true voices too. I'm looking forward to my-

02:03.840 --> 02:07.360
Your true voice. My true voice has come in.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.080
Yeah, so maybe someday I'll get lucky and find my true voice.

02:12.080 --> 02:16.240
Oh no. Finally, distinguishable voices.

02:16.240 --> 02:22.240
Your true calling was to set us apart. Oh, my bones feel so much straighter.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.920
It's turning into an Adam Sandler thing.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.160
This is Griffin's new character, Prospector going through a washing machine.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.480
Who maybe is possessed by Adam Sandler.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Sorry, I had to sit down. That was-

02:38.000 --> 02:39.920
You watered yourself out, huh? Okay, well Griffin is the first to fall.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.320
Can I sit back down because I hate this.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.760
Yeah, actually, eagle-eared listeners will know that I'm still fucking standing up.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.200
I cannot hide this power. I cannot hide this just raw.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.560
I can't turn away.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.160
I just want to sit down more than anything right now.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.440
When I used to be a professional actor, my go-to acting choice,

03:01.440 --> 03:04.960
quote unquote, was to have my character want to sit down all the time.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.280
Loving that, loving that. But I used to love that. Now I hate it. I'm a stander.

03:09.280 --> 03:13.760
Excuse me, breaking news. This monitor tilts up.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.760
I'm going to try sitting down and see if I can tell a difference between you guys and myself.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.560
All right, you do that. I'm going to keep my legs stiff and straight like

03:20.560 --> 03:22.560
two big massive boners.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.880
Oh, I'm sitting down. This is nice.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.160
Oh, no.

03:26.160 --> 03:31.280
Oh, no. You have nothing in the tank. I'm going to start the program now.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.840
And there's nothing you can do to stop me. You're all getting-

03:33.840 --> 03:35.600
You're so confident.

03:35.600 --> 03:41.520
My brother, my brother and me in its true form. We're finally giving you at two-thirds power.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.840
Okay, should I stand back up?

03:43.840 --> 03:46.720
Stand back up, Travis. Don't be afraid of your destiny.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.400
Stand back up!

03:48.400 --> 03:49.120
There he is.

03:49.120 --> 03:54.240
There he is. Here we go. Time for the program. The real program to begin.

03:54.240 --> 03:58.080
My standing energy has also influenced my mind to tell me that we've gotten

03:58.080 --> 04:00.000
everything we're going to get out of this bit.

04:00.640 --> 04:06.160
We- Well, I feel like we should call this one episode one.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.680
This is the true beginning of my brother, my brother and me, The Standing Podcast.

04:11.680 --> 04:16.160
Speaking of which, I hope this is someone's first episode they've ever listened to.

04:16.160 --> 04:20.560
Yeah. The standing show you tried to get me to listen to? I don't get it.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.160
They just talked for 15 minutes about whether they were standing up or sitting down,

04:24.160 --> 04:24.560
and this is good?

04:24.560 --> 04:27.120
Is that every episode? Do they talk about sitting that much, too?

04:27.120 --> 04:30.160
They've done this for like 460-some episodes?

04:30.160 --> 04:34.000
You know what's wild is it feels like we've been talking about standing for 15 minutes.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.600
It's been less than four. I think there's a sort of time dilation

04:38.160 --> 04:41.520
from standing because you're further away from the planet or something.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.320
Yeah, it does track.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.360
It's impossible. This show is going to feel like it goes forever,

04:45.360 --> 04:50.640
but I'm not giving up. I want true facts. I want to know when you boys sit down

04:50.640 --> 04:53.600
and if you can hang for an entire episode with full standing power.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.840
What if we did a laying down show?

04:55.840 --> 04:56.400
We'll do that next time.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.840
It's the Casper one. We did that already.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.080
That Casper one. Right, right, right. Okay.

05:00.080 --> 05:06.240
This past Christmas, I bought my parents a DVD of Joe versus the Volcano.

05:06.240 --> 05:06.800
Nice.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.920
Keeps on giving that one.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.000
Oh, yeah. That's so good.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.760
That's a repeat watcher.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.120
It is. Me and my friends watch it every Thanksgiving.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.920
No, that's Paul Barp.

05:17.920 --> 05:18.240
That's Paul Barp.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.280
It's your brother. It's not your friends.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.400
That too, yes.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.480
It was the movie they saw on their first date.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.320
Oh, that's sweet. Oh, my God.

05:24.320 --> 05:29.360
There are people who listen to the show whose parents' first date was to Joe versus the Volcano.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.920
That is impossible. That's impossible.

05:31.920 --> 05:36.080
There's people on this podcast who went on a first date to Mortal Kombat Annihilation,

05:36.080 --> 05:39.760
so I'm not going to sit here and listen to your nitpicking.

05:39.760 --> 05:44.560
I just mean the time. I'm not even saying, like, the content of the film.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.480
I'm just saying, like, wow.

05:46.480 --> 05:51.680
Listen, hand to God, I tell you that Joe versus the Volcano came out in the 90s.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.960
I don't think that's true, but it doesn't feel not true.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.440
I feel like Justin just sat down.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.080
No, with all the fussing and fighting, the standing,

06:02.080 --> 06:05.440
my microphone was trying to fall off my desk, but it does not get a break.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.080
I don't get a break. The mic doesn't get a break.

06:08.080 --> 06:08.960
Let's go.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.560
I wound up buying them a few other things and didn't give them the DVD

06:12.560 --> 06:16.160
and decided to save it for their anniversary, even more special.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.960
I'm now realizing that I've never given them an anniversary gift as long as I've been alive.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.120
So now I'm not sure if this is an awkward idea,

06:23.120 --> 06:26.800
especially since I don't know if this year is a big milestone for their marriage or not.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.760
And there's no way of finding out.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.840
Yeah, I'm considering just waiting until Christmas again to give it to them,

06:33.840 --> 06:39.360
especially since the DVD is already wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper from this past December.

06:39.360 --> 06:43.840
How do I give my parents this Tom Hanks DVD naturally?

06:45.600 --> 06:50.000
That's offensive about parents present in Pennsylvania.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.600
Are you worried at all that when you give it to them,

06:51.600 --> 06:54.880
your parents are like, wait a minute, this is the wrapping paper from last Christmas.

06:54.880 --> 07:00.960
Victoria and I have talked about it and we've settled on a natural Tom Hanks DVD.

07:00.960 --> 07:07.440
We don't want to give the Tom Hanks DVD in a hospital.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.960
How impersonal is that?

07:08.960 --> 07:11.200
This is a Tom Hanks DVD.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.520
It should be a celebration, an at home celebration in a Jacuzzi.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.840
Just goosh it out onto this splash pad.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.120
With just our closest friends and family around, perhaps a Tom Hanks doula.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.840
Perhaps Tom Hanks himself as the doula.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.800
We will accept Colin in his absence.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.440
Yes, of course.

07:32.880 --> 07:38.160
Which anniversary year, there's like, I think I just did paper.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.720
Which anniversary year is polycarbonate plastic?

07:43.440 --> 07:44.800
Is it 60?

07:44.800 --> 07:47.600
Well, I think if I'm, let me look it up real quick.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.200
Click, click, click, click, click, click, keyboard sounds.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.440
Yeah, okay, it says right here, 32 years is the DVD year,

07:55.440 --> 07:59.840
but it does specify only the DVD of volunteers.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.440
What year, Travis, as long as you're on your computer,

08:03.440 --> 08:05.600
what year did Joe versus the volcano come out?

08:05.600 --> 08:06.480
Click, click, click, click.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.320
Well, no, I want to run a little bit of math here.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.480
Google says the 90s probably.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.320
All right, Google.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.120
Boy, they sure are shitting the bed on that search engine.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.160
Yeah, it's their fault for sure, for sure.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.040
It's hard to type when you're standing up, not at a standing desk.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.160
But the hard thing is that I'm not,

08:26.160 --> 08:28.240
I feel like as someone who insists on standing,

08:28.240 --> 08:30.080
I'm also someone who should be bad at Google.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.400
This movie came out in 1990, okay?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.880
Boom, boom goes the dynamite.

08:36.880 --> 08:37.840
Boom, nothing.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.400
1990, Joe versus the volcano came out.

08:40.400 --> 08:46.080
So these parents have been married for,

08:46.080 --> 08:48.960
I mean, it could be they just passed 25.

08:48.960 --> 08:53.280
Assuming they walked out of the theater

08:53.280 --> 08:56.560
and immediately got married on the fucking street,

08:56.560 --> 08:58.320
right there, God and everyone.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.120
Listen, Joe versus the volcano, it's a very romantic movie.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.600
Yes, I'm doing the math now and realizing

09:03.600 --> 09:05.600
that you are giving them four years of dating.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.840
Is that how long you think people should be together, Justin,

09:07.840 --> 09:08.880
before they pop it?

09:08.880 --> 09:11.520
It's a wild choice, I know,

09:11.520 --> 09:15.120
but it's also the 30th anniversary is so far away

09:15.120 --> 09:18.080
if they did get married during the release window.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.280
In the initial box office,

09:19.280 --> 09:21.520
let's play the box office game for Joe versus the volcano.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.960
The week, no, just kidding.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
So I would say comfortably,

09:26.960 --> 09:32.480
let's say somewhere between 28 and 23 years.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.040
Something like that, it doesn't matter.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.400
It doesn't matter, Justin?

09:38.400 --> 09:39.360
It doesn't matter?

09:39.360 --> 09:42.800
Our question answers, parents, marriage, does it matter?

09:42.800 --> 09:45.760
No, it's all important because this union

09:45.760 --> 09:48.000
is the reason you're on the fucking planet.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.600
Without Joe versus the volcano, you are carbon, okay?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.560
You're right, yes.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.840
You're unassigned carbon without the hilarious work

09:55.840 --> 09:57.600
of Tom Hanks and-

09:57.600 --> 10:00.160
And John Patrick Shanley and Meg Ryan.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.040
The whole family, now Travis is on Google,

10:03.040 --> 10:04.320
now he's Googling things.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.040
Without this film, you're fucking carbon.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.800
You should be handing it to everyone you meet.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.000
You should wear a t-shirt in the film every single day.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.720
Every Joe versus the volcano is a reason for celebration.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.000
You've waited this one too long,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.240
give them the DVD, then go get the Blu-ray,

10:18.240 --> 10:20.560
because without this, you'd be fucking dust.

10:20.560 --> 10:24.400
You should give them the Blu-ray every day for a year.

10:24.400 --> 10:24.720
Yeah.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.760
Just to say like, hey,

10:26.800 --> 10:28.800
maybe they'll make a Joe versus the volcano too

10:28.800 --> 10:31.360
and your parents will get, I don't know, second married.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.920
That's what they need to rededicate their vows.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.760
Now hold on, Travis.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.400
If you're suggesting the more Joe versus the volcano

10:38.400 --> 10:42.400
you give them, the more in love they will become,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.240
I think there's a point where you can reach

10:44.240 --> 10:46.560
a dangerous amount of Joe versus the volcano.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.280
Absolutely.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.880
An eruption point, if you will.

10:48.880 --> 10:52.160
An eruption point, and I'm worried that it's like three.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.520
So don't test this.

10:53.520 --> 10:53.920
It is not worth it.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.800
Hey, just a pitch Hollywood, if you're listening,

10:56.800 --> 10:59.040
Joe versus the volcano versus Predator.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.840
That's extremely powerful.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.080
Yeah.

11:02.080 --> 11:02.640
Thank you.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.720
No matter what happens, we lose.

11:05.280 --> 11:05.760
Who wins?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.040
We lose, except Joe.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.200
If he wins, we're probably okay.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.440
We're probably fine if Joe wins.

11:12.400 --> 11:12.640
Well.

11:13.200 --> 11:13.440
Well?

11:13.440 --> 11:16.320
I mean, maybe at that point hubris will overtake Joe.

11:16.320 --> 11:16.800
Yeah.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.040
If there's a human man who can kill the Predator

11:19.040 --> 11:21.040
and a volcano, I'm not sure I want to be

11:21.040 --> 11:23.520
walking the same orb as them.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.320
Yeah, that's terrible.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.040
That's too much.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.120
No one man should have all that power.

11:27.120 --> 11:27.760
This is true.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.640
Can I read a Yahoo?

11:29.200 --> 11:29.700
Yes.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.000
Here's a Yahoo sent in by Graham Roebuck.

11:32.000 --> 11:32.400
Thanks, Graham.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.440
It's Yahoo answers user Giuseppe, who asks,

11:37.040 --> 11:41.360
if you had a kangaroo pouch, what would you mainly put in it?

11:41.360 --> 11:42.320
Tiny kangaroo.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.440
Next.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.400
You don't have that.

11:45.280 --> 11:45.680
You don't have that.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.360
I don't have a tiny kangaroo?

11:47.360 --> 11:48.640
You telling jokes.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.560
I want real shit, Travis.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.440
I'm a stander now.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.720
I won't stand for lies.

11:53.840 --> 11:54.320
Dang.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.080
Guys, can we back up for a second?

11:56.640 --> 11:58.480
Do you need to talk about Joe versus volcano more?

11:58.480 --> 11:59.040
Is there more?

11:59.040 --> 12:00.160
Yeah, just for a second.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.680
Can we just talk about John Patrick Shanley's Twitter account?

12:04.240 --> 12:06.400
Because it's so fucking fresh.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.800
This guy is bringing it every single day

12:08.800 --> 12:11.440
and I don't want to make mention of him

12:11.440 --> 12:14.240
and not recognize the fact that he's fucking bringing the heat

12:14.240 --> 12:15.360
every single tweet.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.400
Bringing the heat with every tweet.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.880
John Patrick Shanley, director of Joe versus the Volcano.

12:20.880 --> 12:21.920
You ready for this?

12:21.920 --> 12:22.160
Sure.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.800
Every one of us is a hideout for so many strange characters.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.640
Some never speak.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.360
Some appear once a sudden flash in the eye

12:31.360 --> 12:34.960
and withdraw again like a sea monster returning to the depths.

12:34.960 --> 12:40.160
The face we show to the world is often merely a convenient pose

12:40.160 --> 12:42.240
hiding a multitude.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.720
Meanwhile, Justin McElroy is like,

12:44.720 --> 12:45.920
new Mario looks good.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.080
Nothing.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.920
John Patrick Shanley bringing it.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.000
Have you ever been blamed for the rain?

12:52.640 --> 12:53.920
You have, my friend.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.760
Sooner or later, each of us is blamed for something beyond our control.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.720
But remember this.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.000
It's a beautiful thing to be blamed for the rain.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.280
And who knows?

13:04.320 --> 13:05.520
Maybe somehow it's true.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.600
Hey, hey, John, John.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.720
It's wicked not though.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.200
Hey, John, you're bringing the fucking heat, John.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.320
The heat is hot, John.

13:16.320 --> 13:22.000
But I'm not gonna let you just sort of barf out some pseudoscience garbage.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.520
I did not make it rain.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.720
The only time I make it rain is when I do it funny with a bunch of money.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.320
That is true.

13:28.320 --> 13:28.560
Dang.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.400
John's tweeting out a bunch of great pictures all the time.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.320
He's got some fucking fresh shirts.

13:34.320 --> 13:34.560
Yes.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.760
Get on to this Twitter account.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.040
Demons.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.440
I'm reading this sight unseen because I just know it's gonna be fresh.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.080
Ready?

13:42.080 --> 13:42.800
Demons.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.000
They tell you things and suggest that you keep them secret.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.560
Never do.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.120
A secret kept with a demon is a dark marriage and will end badly.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.920
If a demon asks for your discretion, break faith as quickly as you can.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.480
To trust a demon is to distrust humanity.

14:00.480 --> 14:00.960
Thank you, John.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.720
Is JPS being literal?

14:02.720 --> 14:06.640
Are you still like really, really into this guidance, my bud?

14:06.640 --> 14:08.320
This is so fucking fresh.

14:08.320 --> 14:12.240
A secret kept with a demon is a marriage based off of Joe versus the Vulcan.

14:12.240 --> 14:12.800
Yes.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.000
Okay, okay, okay.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.560
I think of radio.

14:16.560 --> 14:19.520
It finds music in the apparently empty air.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.800
Some people are like that too, picking up what is invisible.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.600
Do you listen for what is not quite said?

14:28.160 --> 14:32.320
Or do you pretend that the surface of life is its substance?

14:32.960 --> 14:36.800
Speak to me of what you wordlessly discern.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.480
Super loud bong noise.

14:38.480 --> 14:38.960
Thank you.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.320
And then it says here, huge bong rip.

14:42.320 --> 14:42.720
Okay.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.480
In all caps.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.760
Okay, I want to stop, but like-

14:45.760 --> 14:46.320
Thank you, John.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.760
Get on to this account.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.160
Yeah, sure.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.120
Uh, so-

14:49.120 --> 14:51.040
Get a follow going real quick.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.080
If you had a kangaroo pouch, what would you mainly put in it?

14:54.080 --> 14:56.000
Justin, Travis told a joke.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.920
Can you fucking believe it on standing day?

14:59.920 --> 15:07.120
Okay, the number one thing I would put in it is tokens and tickets at Billy Bob's Wonderland.

15:07.120 --> 15:12.000
Because you walk around, you have a huge mountain of tokens because it only makes sense to buy them

15:12.000 --> 15:12.720
in bulk.

15:12.720 --> 15:16.560
You don't nickel and dime yourself $5 here, $10 here.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.640
You spend $20 and then you get a lot more bonus tokens, right?

15:20.640 --> 15:26.400
You get that and you fill that in one pocket and then you start getting these wads of tickets.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.240
If you're like me and you're putting in the money and the time and the hard hours-

15:30.240 --> 15:31.840
And the skill.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.880
The skill, thank you, Travis, because it's not gambling.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.080
It's a talent.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.520
And you start getting these piles of tickets and where do you put them on?

15:39.520 --> 15:42.960
Also, by the way, your kid wants you to hold their Slurpee.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.640
What, do I have three hands?

15:44.640 --> 15:46.400
No, but you got a belly pouch.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.120
I got a pouch.

15:47.120 --> 15:47.920
I do have a belly.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.280
Put that in Papa's pouch.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.840
Put those tickets in Papa's pouch.

15:51.840 --> 15:55.920
I, you know, those times made me jealous when they used to.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.400
I don't think they do this anymore, but casinos used to give out big plastic cups

16:00.400 --> 16:03.280
that you could put all your quarters and stuff in.

16:03.280 --> 16:08.560
They should have those at Billy Bob's and similar arcades for me to collect all my fat wads of

16:08.560 --> 16:15.920
tickets or alternately slice a big slice in my skin in my belly region that I can peel away from.

16:17.440 --> 16:21.840
I want to leave the muscle there because there's tons of it, am I right?

16:21.840 --> 16:25.520
But just peel the skin away and tuck the tokens into my belly.

16:25.520 --> 16:32.000
Hey, Trav, your kangaroo pouch is leaking and also it stinks.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.080
So how long has it, have you done, did you go see a professional about this?

16:36.080 --> 16:38.000
No, I did this myself at home.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.360
Okay, well, it is wet.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.520
It's always wet and it is-

16:41.520 --> 16:42.800
I've ruined these tickets.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.200
Yeah, they are irredeemable.

16:45.200 --> 16:49.360
There's other ruined things that are more like tendons and stuff and it did-

16:49.360 --> 16:50.400
Yeah, there's sepsis.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.840
Yeah, Griffin, there's sepsis.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.600
This smells miserable too, man.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.440
This is, I'm trying to eat a pizza pie.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.040
Listen, I'm not proud of what I've done, but it's too late to go back.

16:59.040 --> 17:03.520
Evolution is hard, Griffin, and a man becoming kangaroo,

17:04.240 --> 17:07.520
listen, they said it couldn't be done and in fact, it shouldn't be done.

17:07.520 --> 17:17.200
God makes kangaroo, kangaroo makes man, man turns self into kangaroo, kangaroo kills kangaroo,

17:17.200 --> 17:24.320
God kills kangaroo, kangaroo, kangaroo inherit the earth.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.600
Yep, there it is.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.800
There it is.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.080
That's exactly what happens.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.000
I think I'd do jelly beans.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.480
How many, how many, hey Griffin, don't make, don't make up a bunch of garbage.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.360
How many jelly beans would you have in there?

17:39.360 --> 17:40.960
How many jelly beans?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.920
How many jelly beans can fit in your pouch?

17:43.920 --> 17:45.680
This is the new hit single.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.560
This is the new hit single from Lizzo.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.680
You know what, guys?

17:50.240 --> 17:54.240
Technically, I have a pouch for jelly beans already.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.080
It just does one of the dang things.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.840
Are you talking about your urethra?

17:59.840 --> 18:00.800
No, my belly button.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.520
You mean your belly button, but I want to give back to Justin today.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.200
What I like to do is put a bunch of jelly beans up there,

18:09.200 --> 18:11.840
but hold in my pee a long time and shoot them all out.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.400
Well, listen, I got to do something with the butter popcorn ones

18:14.400 --> 18:15.760
because I'm not fucking eating them.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.520
Honey, I got to get home.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.880
I'm about to blast this dang jelly bean clean through the windshield

18:23.600 --> 18:26.320
with my ropey flow of urine.

18:26.320 --> 18:31.360
I'm going to fucking knock that can of coke off that fence for old Ronald Reagan.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.160
Got it.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.880
I want to go by your ex-boyfriend's house and show them I got a toasted

18:38.880 --> 18:40.800
marshmallow in there because I'm fucking loco.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.440
That's just weird.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.800
I don't care to waste the best jelly belly that there is

18:46.800 --> 18:48.560
with plugging up my urethra.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.360
I don't care.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.280
That's how I do it.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.240
Oh, I want to sit down so bad.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.520
I know, I know.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.200
This show is going so good though.

18:57.200 --> 18:57.600
Starting.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.480
It's hard to tell.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.640
It's not hard to tell.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.080
I feel the power of this show.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.200
Okay?

19:03.200 --> 19:04.080
Don't be like that.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.320
Okay, it's only been like 20 minutes.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.440
I know that is one thing that I will say.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.080
There is definitely some time dilation curry.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.600
I'm saying yes, yeah.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.880
I don't know that it's like that for the listener.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.000
No, they're loving.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.680
They're like loving it because the power of our standing energy

19:21.680 --> 19:25.520
is being siphoned into the show and enhancing their sitting.

19:25.520 --> 19:25.840
Right.

19:25.840 --> 19:30.880
Listener, if you and Solidarity have tried to stand for the entirety of this program so far,

19:30.880 --> 19:32.160
please don't be a hero.

19:32.160 --> 19:32.640
It sucks, yeah.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.200
21, 22 minutes.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.840
It's all too much for 15, however much Griffin has cut out.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.280
It's all too much for any one person to be standing.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.000
I think I'm gonna have to do some like freestyle yoga over here.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That's the weird, that's what will fuck you up though.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.280
Think about this though.

19:47.280 --> 19:53.120
There will be moments in that time that we have been standing that Griffin will cut out.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.960
That will have done nothing for us.

19:54.960 --> 19:55.600
Yeah.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.240
Like, you know what I mean?

19:56.240 --> 19:57.280
We just stood for nothing.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.400
Yeah, I'm gonna have to do some real soul searching about the pudding jelly beans and

20:00.400 --> 20:01.520
your ding-a-long.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.160
If you cut that, cut that, then what will our next book be titled?

20:07.520 --> 20:09.280
I have another question here.

20:09.280 --> 20:13.600
Starting last year, I work a seasonal job in the fall.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.960
Wow, this is a lot of time dilations.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.200
Yeah, we're in the wormhole right now.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.040
We can't fucking do this math.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.760
Hi, it's me, Chris Nolan, and my dad in the future went back.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.960
Starting last year, I work a seasonal job in the fall.

20:31.600 --> 20:36.960
I work in the kitchen area where we serve plain, sugared, and glazed donuts.

20:36.960 --> 20:41.040
One day, while working, a fellow employee interrupted me while I was telling a customer

20:41.040 --> 20:47.040
that we did not serve powdered donuts, saying that it was like a secret menu item.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.440
She went in the back and came back with two powdered donuts.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.160
I had never seen an employee do that before.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.320
I never saw anyone do it again.

20:54.320 --> 20:59.040
Brothers, what do I do if a customer asks me for a powdered donut?

20:59.040 --> 21:03.280
Do I go into the back and attempt to make a powdered donut?

21:03.280 --> 21:05.760
And that's for do not donut.

21:05.760 --> 21:10.160
Hey, y'all, this is Griffin, former TCBY employee.

21:10.160 --> 21:16.160
If you go to a register and ask for something at like a specialty food store like this,

21:16.960 --> 21:20.320
and you say, I want a powdered donut, daddy.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.280
And they say, I'll get you a powdered donut.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.640
And then they walk into the back room and produce something that's not on the menu.

21:26.640 --> 21:30.480
Do not eat that donut, because I'm not saying that they have befouled it,

21:30.480 --> 21:34.080
but I'm just saying they didn't not befoul it.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.400
The odds of befoulement are rather high.

21:36.400 --> 21:41.360
Why would they have a secret menu item at their three donut restaurant?

21:41.360 --> 21:45.680
Unless they have many, many donut options and you just kind of have to guess,

21:45.680 --> 21:48.480
and it's like a fun mystery every time you go inside.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.480
Because it means they have the powdered sugar, and they have plain donuts.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.960
Which means at some point, the discussion was had of,

21:54.960 --> 21:59.920
do you want to increase our stock options by, I don't know,

21:59.920 --> 22:04.720
either 33.3% or 25%, Travis isn't sure how that works out.

22:04.720 --> 22:10.720
No, I'd rather just leave it for a select few with refined palates.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.680
Welcome to Dunkin' Donuts, it's the name of it.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.400
We just put a question mark at the end of our franchise.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.200
Powdered donuts are-

22:19.200 --> 22:23.120
You've got to come to our donut shop and see if you can stump us with donuts.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.000
See if we can make, the answer is probably no.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.480
Here's the thing y'all, powdered donuts are the fucking pits.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.320
If you're a parent, my daughter is obsessed with these things, the baby one.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.360
Obsessed with these things, these fucking little powdered donuts.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.080
It's hell, they just start touching it to everything.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.120
Their clothes are ruined, the couch is ruined, their mouth is ruined.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.040
It's a hell dessert, and it shouldn't be on sale to anybody.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.360
And I'm sorry, I don't even think you should be eating that.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.080
What's that all over your hands? Are you a grown up?

22:52.080 --> 22:54.000
You're not, not with a powdered donut, you're not.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.080
You're not, not with a powdered donut, you're not.

22:56.080 --> 23:00.480
Not only that, but I believe that powdered donuts are the closest I've ever come to being poisoned.

23:00.480 --> 23:07.600
Because when you take a bite of them, just like particulate, goes flying into your throat.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.480
And no, like, it is, it's like a trick.

23:10.480 --> 23:16.080
Nobody's like, nobody's like, I'll be happy to sign the big merger.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.920
Let me finish this super sloppy powdered donut.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.600
Simply not done.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.440
Oh boy, this fucking standing energy is giving me some sass.

23:25.440 --> 23:30.000
Because I want to just be like, ask your coworker how they did that.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.040
Just ask, I don't know why you're asking us, go ask.

23:33.040 --> 23:36.320
If they have sugar and a food processor or a blender or something.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.440
Just chomp it right up, yeah.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.800
It just chomps it right up, right?

23:38.800 --> 23:42.080
They do like a special thing, a treat, they'll do a special treat.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.400
But why? It's not on the menu.

23:44.400 --> 23:52.800
What's the benefit of doing the extra work to make an off menu item for some rando customer?

23:52.800 --> 23:56.080
Because you're going the extra fucking mile.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.840
For those donut tips.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.880
Have you ever seen the movie Big Daddy?

24:00.880 --> 24:01.200
Yes.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.160
You do ask him, you do ask him every episode, Justin.

24:10.160 --> 24:15.200
I'm going to have this conversation again, Justin.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.840
There's a scene where they go into McDonald's, right?

24:17.840 --> 24:23.360
And they've stopped selling breakfast, but his child really wants breakfast.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.720
Not his child, a child.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.760
As Griffin also points out every episode,

24:29.760 --> 24:33.120
he's not technically his big daddy through most of the film.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.440
No, no, Justin, no technically about it.

24:37.440 --> 24:41.440
He's not related, has no legal claim over this child.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.440
I think at the end he adopts him, right?

24:43.440 --> 24:43.920
No, no.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.520
It's been a while since I've seen the movie.

24:45.520 --> 24:46.400
He does not.

24:46.400 --> 24:49.440
He goes to John Stewart and lives with John Stewart.

24:50.240 --> 24:54.000
I haven't seen it, but in the trailer for the movie Big Daddy,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.600
he wants to get in McDonald's and the people at McDonald's say, no, it's too late.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.240
No, you kidnapped this child, I'm calling the police.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.320
They won't make it for him.

25:02.320 --> 25:06.800
And what I'm saying is if they had said, all right, no problem, just this once,

25:06.800 --> 25:09.600
a McMuffin for the boy, if they had done that,

25:09.600 --> 25:12.800
this would be Adam Sandler's number one McDonald's spot.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.840
You would have a customer for life, though.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.080
That's how you move up in the ladder.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.520
No, no, no, this is what they don't tell you.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.360
Because if you make that McMuffin once for Adam Sandler,

25:25.360 --> 25:28.400
you'll always have to make that McMuffin for Adam Sandler.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.040
We gotta just-

25:29.040 --> 25:30.880
Are you talking about McMuffin creep?

25:30.880 --> 25:36.560
Because he comes in then, he came in at 10.03 the first time and he rolls in at 10.17.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.000
But you made the McMuffin for the boy before, why?

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
Pretty soon the whole company at McDonald's has to change their policy to offer breakfast all day

25:44.000 --> 25:49.840
because Adam Sandler won't stop coming in at 12.56 asking for a fucking egg McMuffin.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.440
Boy, I love you, boys.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.560
I really love you, boys.

25:53.200 --> 25:58.240
But are you both under the impression that every Adam Sandler movie

25:58.960 --> 26:01.920
is secretly filmed without him knowing it

26:01.920 --> 26:06.960
and takes place in the real world, unscripted?

26:06.960 --> 26:08.720
And so when he went to this McDonald's,

26:08.720 --> 26:14.000
if the scene, which is to say reality, had gone a different way,

26:14.000 --> 26:19.760
then this would be famous actor-comedian Adam Sandler's new favorite McDonald's.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.260
Yes.

26:21.840 --> 26:26.640
I'm saying, I'm taking that as a microcosm for treating your customers right.

26:26.640 --> 26:31.840
No, but I am saying that this is a weird kind of punked hidden camera scenario

26:31.840 --> 26:35.360
where they just keep filming movies around Adam Sandler.

26:35.360 --> 26:39.680
Sweet Justin, the alternative is that there would be a scene in Big Daddy where he's like,

26:39.680 --> 26:41.520
oh, it's 10.03, can I please give him a McMuffin?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.040
No, please, it's for the kid.

26:43.040 --> 26:43.920
Yeah, okay.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.880
And they eat the breakfast and Adam Sandler walks out the door like,

26:46.880 --> 26:49.120
this is my new favorite McDonald's.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.640
Yeah, that's a very good point.

26:52.640 --> 26:57.360
But if Travis is right, then explain, don't mess with the Zoan, you know what I mean?

26:57.360 --> 26:58.240
Listen, that was a dark time for Adam Sandler.

26:58.240 --> 27:01.440
That wasn't Adam Sandler, that was Zoan.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.560
No, that was Adam Sandler.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.560
Okay, but like, why, if you didn't know he was in a movie.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.680
Why would he be Zoan?

27:07.680 --> 27:08.880
It was Halloween!

27:08.880 --> 27:11.280
He didn't know he was in a movie, why was he Zoan?

27:11.280 --> 27:12.320
For Halloween?

27:12.320 --> 27:12.820
Yeah.

27:13.680 --> 27:16.960
Ah, shit, there's multiple Adam Sandlers like in The Prestige.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.320
That's it.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.000
Have you ever seen Jet Li's The One?

27:20.000 --> 27:23.520
Cause I did a long time ago and it's like that.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.360
The Prestige.

27:25.360 --> 27:29.040
That bit felt like it was 40 minutes long.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.920
It feels like I should be like, that's the end of the podcast.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.760
Thank you for enjoying it.

27:33.760 --> 27:37.120
But no, it is time for us to briefly head into the Money Zone.

27:37.120 --> 27:50.880
So let's head over there and see what's cooking.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.320
Oh, look at what's cooking.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.760
I'm gonna go get a soda, I'll be right back.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.520
Oh, this is so appropriate.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.720
It's a, what a good transition talking about what's cooking

27:58.720 --> 28:01.360
because our first sponsor is Stitch Fix.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.560
I gotta go get a soda, stop talking.

28:04.560 --> 28:09.040
Well, Jet Li, there's no time to stop talking cause we need to talk about Stitch Fix.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.840
If you're cooking up some clothes for dinner-

28:11.840 --> 28:14.240
Are you stirring up a big pot of clothes?

28:16.000 --> 28:21.920
Are you pan frying some jorts and you, so now you need more clothes because you've cooked-

28:21.920 --> 28:23.840
Sauteing some socks, perhaps?

28:23.840 --> 28:25.280
That's a mistake.

28:25.280 --> 28:30.080
Don't, well, I'm not here to kink shame you, but I am gonna tell you that if you've eaten,

28:30.080 --> 28:33.520
cooked and eaten all your clothes and Stitch Fix is gonna help you get that,

28:33.520 --> 28:41.440
get that closet, that wardrobe back on point in an easy, stylish, no hassles way.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.960
We all use Stitch Fix.

28:42.960 --> 28:48.240
When I see that box sitting on my doorstep after a long day at the Mines

28:48.240 --> 28:52.000
and I come home and I see that box on my doorstep, I get so excited to see the clothes inside

28:52.000 --> 28:56.720
because I know that I have worked with a personal stylist, told them what I liked,

28:56.720 --> 29:02.560
and then they have chosen some stuff for me and it's good stuff and I only pay for what I keep

29:02.560 --> 29:06.160
and the $20 styling fee for finding those clothes is automatically applied

29:06.160 --> 29:08.240
towards anything I keep from the box.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.560
It is a real good, real good service.

Griffin, can I ask you a question?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Sure.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.440
You ever bought anything online?

29:35.440 --> 29:37.760
That's, that's just part one of the question.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.120
There's a second part to the question.

29:40.160 --> 29:40.400
Yeah.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.720
Part one, have you ever bought anything online?

29:42.720 --> 29:44.000
Yeah, man, baseball trophy.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.120
Okay.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.600
Couldn't get one the usual way.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.240
Yes.

29:48.240 --> 29:52.240
When you bought that baseball trophy, did you perhaps find out later that

29:52.240 --> 29:56.960
somewhere else was selling it on a discount and you paid full price for it like a dummy?

29:56.960 --> 30:04.400
I paid $4,500 for my baseball trophy, so like I now know with hindsight that I was snookered.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.960
You know, if you had used Honey, which is a free browser add-on that finds you the best deals

30:10.960 --> 30:14.800

30:20.960 --> 30:23.120
including Amazon Best Buy and more.

30:23.120 --> 30:28.240

30:28.880 --> 30:37.120
billiards trophies, maybe darts championships, World's Best Dad, dog show trophies,

30:37.680 --> 30:39.680
powerlifting trophies.

30:39.680 --> 30:40.880
That's all of them.

30:40.880 --> 30:41.920
That's it.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.400
Hi, I'm Dave.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.360
Hi, I'm Graham.

31:09.360 --> 31:14.000
And we're two house DJs who have been trapped inside our drum machine.

31:14.000 --> 31:20.160
We love it here and we'd love if you stopped by and visited us every week on Stop Podcasting

31:20.160 --> 31:22.960

31:22.960 --> 31:28.000

31:29.440 --> 31:34.080
Stop podcasting yourself on MaximumFun.org.

31:42.160 --> 31:42.800
Okay, here's one.

31:42.800 --> 31:48.160
I work for a large retailer in Cincinnati and back in November, I was promoted to assistant

31:48.160 --> 31:49.040
store manager.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.840
I went through training and started in a new store.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.000
I've been working the new store for the past five months.

31:54.000 --> 32:01.680
Today, I received an email that said they reviewed my application and decided to pursue

32:01.680 --> 32:03.120
other candidates.

32:03.120 --> 32:06.960
Did I just get passive slash aggressively get fired?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.920
And that's from, should I go to work tomorrow?

32:09.920 --> 32:16.560
You know who I am gonna ask about this?

32:16.560 --> 32:17.060
Who?

32:18.240 --> 32:19.200
Laura Dale.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.160
Let me see if I have-

32:20.160 --> 32:23.840
Well, that's gonna set a pretty wild precedent, right?

32:23.840 --> 32:26.320
I guess we can address it with Laura once she's on the call.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.120
Oh, I'm here.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.000
I'm on the call.

32:28.000 --> 32:28.880
What's happened?

32:30.000 --> 32:30.640
Yeah, sorry.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.920
I beeped in on another call so you didn't hear it ring.

32:33.920 --> 32:41.840
Laura was waiting by the phone and then presciently knew that her campaign had paid off.

32:41.840 --> 32:46.480
Yeah, I just, you know, I had a real sense that like, now's the time.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.920
Advice is needed.

32:47.920 --> 32:48.420
Go.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.080
This is the moment.

32:50.880 --> 32:57.840
What's it like, Laura, to be the only person to get to cash in that chip to start to hoist

32:57.840 --> 33:01.040
us on our own petard to be on our show?

33:01.040 --> 33:06.640
To be the one person that did the goof of, hey, if the boys can just confidently say

33:06.640 --> 33:11.680
they're gonna be on a thing and get on the thing, I can do that to get on their thing?

33:11.680 --> 33:12.160
Yeah.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.560
Here's the thing, it would have worked with literally anyone, Laura.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.480
I'm glad it was someone we like and treasure,

33:16.480 --> 33:18.800
because it wouldn't work with anybody because it's only gonna work once.

33:18.800 --> 33:19.360
Yeah, it's done.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.480
This is it.

33:20.480 --> 33:24.800
When I did my Laura K. Buzz will be on my brother, my brother and me, I had a bunch

33:24.800 --> 33:28.880
of people tweet and go, wouldn't it be funny if I did that to get on your podcast?

33:28.880 --> 33:30.640
I was like, do it then.

33:30.640 --> 33:31.200
Oh, shit.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.440
That is how it works, you have to keep paying it backward.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.320
Has anybody done the Joe Rogan one yet?

33:37.680 --> 33:38.720
Don't you think?

33:38.720 --> 33:42.560
Get on there, plug our show, steal some of his audience, now we're the Rogans.

33:42.560 --> 33:48.880
Laura, did you hear the question that I read before you answered?

33:48.880 --> 33:52.880
The question just came into my mind like some wonderful premonition,

33:52.880 --> 33:54.320
and I have advice for you.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.720
I'm glad that you realized I was the person for this.

33:56.720 --> 34:01.120
So this person thinks that like, that, you know, they've been passive aggressively fired.

34:01.120 --> 34:01.920
I disagree.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.400
I think they're unfirable now.

34:04.400 --> 34:09.520
I don't think you can fire someone who you never hired.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.680
They're in some like weird, they're a glitch in the matrix now.

34:13.680 --> 34:17.600
They are just, you can't fire me, you never hired me.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.240
Who am I?

34:18.240 --> 34:19.040
I don't know.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.360
I'm a ghost in the machine.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.920
Yeah, you don't have to show up for work, you don't have to do your responsibility.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.560
You don't have to do your responsibilities because if they try and fire you say,

34:29.360 --> 34:30.000
fire who?

34:33.040 --> 34:36.880
Laura, there is one issue there, and that is if the paychecks do not come.

34:36.880 --> 34:37.920
And that was my question.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.120
If you're not hired, have you been getting paychecks for the last five months?

34:41.120 --> 34:45.280
Because if the answer to that is no, my follow up question is more of a statement,

34:45.280 --> 34:48.560
and it's boy, you sure like Best Buy, huh?

34:48.560 --> 34:50.880
You sure like the work there, huh?

34:50.880 --> 34:54.800
Well, I'm assuming, let's say that you have been being paid for the last few months,

34:54.800 --> 34:56.320
but you haven't been hired.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.480
Can you go talk to your bosses and go,

34:58.480 --> 35:02.480
hey, you know, Tom, who we didn't hire, you know, five months ago,

35:02.480 --> 35:05.440
and we really, you know, we thought about it hard and we didn't hire Tom.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.280
I think that's a huge mistake.

35:07.280 --> 35:11.920
I think we should hire Tom so that you can get paid for doing the job twice.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.720
Are you saying that you should use your sway

35:14.720 --> 35:17.360
as an employee of the company to get yourself hired?

35:17.360 --> 35:22.720
Yeah, I think you should use your position as assistant manager to get yourself hired.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.360
You could use yourself as a reference.

35:25.360 --> 35:29.040
I actually have a close dear friend that works there already, it's me.

35:29.040 --> 35:32.480
Yeah, and then you can be two assistant store managers,

35:32.480 --> 35:34.960
which you add them up, that outranks the manager.

35:36.240 --> 35:40.240
You are also then unstoppable because if you answer only to yourself,

35:41.040 --> 35:45.600
like I am my own assistant manager and my assistant manager is myself,

35:45.600 --> 35:50.560
then I'm pretty sure you can just like restructure the whole company at that point.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.560
And when someone's like, who said you could do this?

35:52.560 --> 35:53.920
Be like, my manager.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.360
I'm like, who's your manager?

35:55.360 --> 35:58.000
Like me, I'm my own assistant manager.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.560
The old manager forged a recursive power loop that I exploited

36:02.560 --> 36:05.920
and now have become, I am Galactus now, so.

36:05.920 --> 36:10.480
I used to work at a telemarketing place that would have a bonus that you would get paid

36:10.480 --> 36:12.560
if you brought a friend in and they got hired there.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.840
That should have been a tip off that that was a bad job, huh?

36:15.840 --> 36:19.120
Now that I'm thinking about it, in retrospect,

36:19.120 --> 36:21.600
that should have been a pretty big red flag.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.640
You know, that happens a lot.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.880
Because I've worked so many retail jobs in my life, I still have that retail stink

36:28.880 --> 36:34.080
that when I am just walking around any retail store, no matter how I am dressed,

36:34.080 --> 36:37.280
at least once I will be asked, do you work here?

36:37.280 --> 36:38.480
No matter what I'm doing.

36:38.480 --> 36:41.760
But there's just something about me that gives off the vibe of like,

36:41.760 --> 36:43.760
this is someone who should work here.

36:43.760 --> 36:44.800
It might be that.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.880
There were lots of people who worked at Best Buy with me

36:46.880 --> 36:49.440
whose names I did not and will not know.

36:49.440 --> 36:54.320
So are you suggesting that maybe like the on paper resume was terrible,

36:54.880 --> 36:58.160
but in person, Jimothy showed up and was just like,

36:58.160 --> 37:00.880
oh, don't you seem like you would work here?

37:00.880 --> 37:02.080
Here's your paycheck.

37:02.080 --> 37:08.480
Travis is suggesting that both he and Jimothy possess a retail-esque frame.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.760
A body, a carriage that just seems to-

37:11.760 --> 37:16.240
Maybe it's Travis's broad shoulders or thick hands.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.760
It might not be my gait.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.600
I might have a retail gait.

37:19.600 --> 37:23.520
If you were a stranger to me and I was at the Staples

37:23.520 --> 37:27.840
and I saw your thick hands reaching for a big thing of paper,

37:27.840 --> 37:31.600
I would just assume like those hands have been thickened by paper lifting

37:31.600 --> 37:33.040
and you are an employee here.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.240
That's an employee who knows his way around a crate.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.040
Look at those hands.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.440
Those are crate hands and they will be right.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.760
Hey, Laura, is it true?

37:42.480 --> 37:45.120
Are the rumors true that you have a book coming out this week?

37:45.120 --> 37:48.080
I do have a book coming out this week and I'm mildly terrified.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.080
You've all done books before.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.040
I don't know how you do it.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.600
It's a lot, books.

37:53.600 --> 37:57.760
Laura, here's one of the prime ones that I've learned.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.520
When somebody says you have a book coming out,

37:59.520 --> 38:02.080
that is a good time to say the name of the book so people can buy it.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.560
Hey, uncomfortable labels.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.440
It's a book about being trans and on the autism spectrum

38:07.440 --> 38:09.920
and how that's really common, but no one talks about it.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.720
And it's coming out on July 18th and it's in book places

38:12.720 --> 38:14.000
and you should all check it out.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.160
Oh, we've got a book coming out this week too?

38:16.160 --> 38:17.360
Buy them both.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.200
Get a two for it.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.320
I've heard that they are good companion books.

38:22.320 --> 38:23.360
Yeah, exactly.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.520
If you don't buy both of them, then you're missing out

38:25.520 --> 38:29.040
on some of the secret special lore of the Adventure Zone.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.720
You got an ARG that kind of weaves between both of them.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.400
See if you can solve it.

38:34.400 --> 38:38.480
Yeah, if you check the same page numbers in both books,

38:38.480 --> 38:43.600
you can crack the code and find out who Angus McDonald really is.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.120
Yes, that is true.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.520
The books do share a lot of similar words.

38:47.520 --> 38:51.040
I wish people could say stuff like that on one of our podcasts

38:51.040 --> 38:53.280
and me not have an actual panic attack.

38:57.680 --> 39:02.000
Laura, this book is available this week on July 18th.

39:02.000 --> 39:02.880
Please go buy it.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.480
Laura, congratulations on your extensive campaign

39:06.480 --> 39:09.360
to get on our show and its success.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.160
Please close the door behind you on your way out.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.680
I'm glad I didn't have to pull the shout at Sydney

39:15.680 --> 39:19.280
until she lets me be on card because that was ready to go.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.680
Yeah, it was lined up.

39:21.680 --> 39:24.400
Yeah, please lock the door on your way out and then burn it

39:24.400 --> 39:26.560
and then put bricks over the door.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.000
This door never existed.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.000
This has been great, but never, no one else.

39:32.000 --> 39:32.640
Never again.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.240
You can come back through the door,

39:36.960 --> 39:40.400
but others can't follow your lead.

39:40.400 --> 39:44.800
It's like the wardrobe in Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.120
It might not work the same again, you know?

39:47.120 --> 39:49.200
Maybe you'll end up on Joe Rogan's show.

39:49.200 --> 39:53.840
Joe Rogan is Mr. Tumnus in this scenario.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.680
He's a very Tumnus-esque figure

39:55.680 --> 39:57.760
as he's been described numerous times.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.680
Laura, Kate Dale, thank you for your time

39:59.680 --> 40:01.120
and your treasured insight.

40:01.120 --> 40:01.920
Thank you so much.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.080
Hey, I've got another Yahoo.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.680
Is Justin back from Sodatown?

40:05.680 --> 40:08.720
Oh yeah, whoa!

40:08.720 --> 40:10.400
Rip it, grip it, and drip it, baby.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.640
Right down your soda hole.

40:15.600 --> 40:19.280
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.760
Oh man, dude, I got a dry soda hole.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.280
Yeah, thanks Merritt.

40:23.280 --> 40:26.800
If only there was some way I could moisten my soda hole.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.520
Yeah, that was a funny thing that I said.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.880
This has been our My Brother, My Brother, Me fan cast.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.480
Shit, Merritt Palmer sent this in.

40:36.480 --> 40:37.040
Thank you, Merritt.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.720
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.200
I'm going to call Ronnie asks,

40:42.400 --> 40:44.880
was this woman at the vets rude?

40:45.440 --> 40:46.800
There's a comma in there.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.960
Was this woman at the vets rude?

40:49.680 --> 40:51.920
Took my cat for his usual injections.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.120
And when I get there,

40:53.120 --> 40:56.080
this woman was sat in the waiting room with her two dogs.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.440
She looked at my cat in his carrier and said to her dogs,

40:59.440 --> 41:01.920
there you go, boys, some nice lunch for you.

41:01.920 --> 41:06.960
Okay, that's the end of the question.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.320
Was that rude?

41:08.320 --> 41:10.640
Was this woman at the vets rude?

41:12.560 --> 41:14.320
Because she gave the boys a nice lunch?

41:15.200 --> 41:17.440
Justin, I think the implication there is that

41:17.440 --> 41:19.360
she was encouraging her dogs to eat

41:19.360 --> 41:21.840
the question askers cat, elf style.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.320
How is that?

41:27.360 --> 41:30.640
Cartoons have taught me that the dog hates the cat.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.720
Does the dog want to eat the cat?

41:32.720 --> 41:34.000
Because I don't know that I've ever seen

41:34.000 --> 41:36.800
or heard that necessarily happen.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.360
Yeah, there's never that scene, right?

41:39.360 --> 41:41.200
So what's the issue?

41:41.200 --> 41:44.080
Well, the cat eat the mouse for sure.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.040
Yes, we know this.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.960
Yes, seen this, yes, happens.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.640
And I believe in the circle of life,

41:48.640 --> 41:50.400
something has to eat the cat.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.600
And it might not be the dog,

41:51.600 --> 41:53.680
but I think the dog is just the next size up.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.040
And it would be weird if,

41:55.040 --> 41:57.920
it would be weird if in like cartoon shorthand,

41:57.920 --> 41:59.120
everyone understood like,

41:59.120 --> 42:02.800
well, yes, cats eat mice and horses eat cats.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.840
Like that would be weird.

42:03.840 --> 42:05.760
There has to be some steps between there,

42:05.760 --> 42:07.280
a little old lady style.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.400
Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.040
And I'm looking at it now, and boy, this feels weird.

42:12.080 --> 42:14.640
Because I think we've probably talked about this before.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.040
But she does swallow the dog to get the cat.

42:17.040 --> 42:17.840
Yes.

42:17.840 --> 42:21.200
Is she expecting the dog to chase the cat out of her?

42:21.200 --> 42:23.120
Because I don't think this dog's gonna eat the,

42:23.120 --> 42:25.040
I think you could have found a better animal.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.600
Does she, she saws the spider to catch the fly.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.880
I don't know why she did that.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.160
I don't know why she swallowed that fly.

42:30.160 --> 42:33.600
But she swallowed the cat to catch the rat,

42:33.600 --> 42:34.800
to catch the spider to catch,

42:34.800 --> 42:37.120
and then she swallowed the dog to get the job, right?

42:38.160 --> 42:38.960
What?

42:38.960 --> 42:39.760
What?

42:39.760 --> 42:42.480
She swallowed the dog for the vine.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.320
She swallowed a goat to get the dog.

42:46.320 --> 42:49.360
She swallowed a cow for the vine.

42:49.360 --> 42:50.080
Vine too.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.600
That was also for the vine.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.080
She swallowed the horse to impress Terry Crews

42:54.080 --> 42:55.280
on America's Got Talent.

42:55.280 --> 42:59.280
This old lady loses the fucking plot.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.320
I got a fly in me.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.600
Let's get the spider to get that.

43:01.600 --> 43:02.400
I got a spider in me.

43:02.400 --> 43:03.120
Let's get a bird.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.000
So far so good.

43:04.000 --> 43:04.560
I got a cat.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.360
I got a bird in me.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.160
Cat, get in there.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.200
You know what's up.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.200
Dog, now it's your turn to go get the cat.

43:10.480 --> 43:10.880
All right.

43:11.520 --> 43:12.720
Goat, go get this dog.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.160
Goat's like, are you sure?

43:14.160 --> 43:14.660
Whoa!

43:16.400 --> 43:19.040
I will say a dog's not kind of my natural food.

43:19.040 --> 43:19.920
Whoa!

43:19.920 --> 43:21.760
Hey cow, you're bigger than a goat.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.200
Get in there and eat it.

43:23.200 --> 43:23.920
That's not real.

43:23.920 --> 43:24.420
Whoa!

43:24.420 --> 43:27.220
Horse, you're smaller than a cow,

43:27.220 --> 43:30.500
but I've completely just sort of lost the roadmap here.

43:32.020 --> 43:33.140
Do you think at that point,

43:33.140 --> 43:35.620
the goat and the cow and the horse got in there

43:35.620 --> 43:37.140
and looked at the dog and the dog was like,

43:37.140 --> 43:38.180
what are you all going to do?

43:38.180 --> 43:39.540
And they're like, we don't even know.

43:40.260 --> 43:43.540
She should have swallowed like a shark or a T-Rex or something.

43:45.300 --> 43:47.380
So anyway, is that rude?

43:47.380 --> 43:51.220
I don't, I have, I am, I no longer have a pet,

43:51.220 --> 43:53.780
but I have, I've had this situation,

43:53.780 --> 43:55.620
not this exact situation,

43:55.620 --> 43:59.860
but like in the waiting room of the vet is,

43:59.860 --> 44:03.140
there's some weird etiquette that I don't necessarily know.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.260
Okay, go on.

44:04.260 --> 44:07.140
Well, the number one thing is that I don't give a shit

44:07.140 --> 44:09.140
about most people's pets.

44:09.140 --> 44:10.260
And that's just the truth.

44:10.260 --> 44:11.620
Yeah, especially mine.

44:11.620 --> 44:12.980
I have noticed that, yeah.

44:12.980 --> 44:16.020
Yeah, and so that's just the truth

44:16.020 --> 44:17.460
and that's the truth of the matter.

44:17.460 --> 44:19.460
But like, if you sit down next to me

44:19.460 --> 44:20.580
and you got a little pupper dog

44:20.580 --> 44:22.180
and the pupper dog wants to interface

44:22.180 --> 44:25.220
with one of your pets, I don't know how to deal with that.

44:25.220 --> 44:27.780
Cause I don't want, I don't necessarily want that, I think.

44:28.420 --> 44:30.500
The only time, the only time that I ever get

44:30.500 --> 44:32.740
a little befuddled at any kind of vet

44:32.740 --> 44:36.020
or any kind of animal daycare thing

44:36.020 --> 44:37.860
is when I see something with their animal

44:37.860 --> 44:41.380
and their animal is just going bonkers,

44:41.380 --> 44:42.900
just like losing it.

44:42.900 --> 44:47.700
And the person is sitting there completely calm and stoic

44:47.700 --> 44:50.740
and like not reacting to their animals,

44:50.740 --> 44:52.740
just like, get me out of here.

44:52.740 --> 44:54.740
Like, and I want to be like, hey,

44:54.740 --> 44:57.940
I don't think they're cool right now.

44:57.940 --> 45:00.020
Like, even my dog will sit there with me

45:00.020 --> 45:02.020
and go like, are they okay?

45:02.020 --> 45:02.820
What is wrong?

45:04.900 --> 45:07.540
And then I'll see somebody bring in like a bird

45:07.540 --> 45:09.460
and I'll just look at him like, really?

45:10.900 --> 45:12.180
You'll look at the bird?

45:12.180 --> 45:14.580
I'll look at the person and be like, really?

45:14.580 --> 45:15.780
You need to fix them up.

45:15.780 --> 45:18.500
There's a bird, there's lots of.

45:18.500 --> 45:19.940
Why so serious?

45:21.700 --> 45:23.620
Let's put a smile on that face.

45:23.620 --> 45:28.580
I'm just saying, there's lots of birds out of nature

45:28.580 --> 45:30.740
and they don't need doctors to live.

45:39.620 --> 45:42.260
I'm just a dog chasing a car.

45:42.260 --> 45:43.140
Literally.

45:43.140 --> 45:46.180
I'm just a dog chasing a cat to eat it, I guess.

45:47.060 --> 45:49.860
And then the cat is chasing a bird, I guess.

45:49.860 --> 45:51.780
And the bird is going after a spider.

45:53.540 --> 45:56.340
I'm just a dog running away from a goat.

45:57.780 --> 45:59.940
In an old lady's intestines.

46:01.620 --> 46:03.940
You want to know how I got these scars?

46:05.060 --> 46:09.780
I was eating a large German shepherd.

46:09.780 --> 46:14.340
To get well together.

46:14.340 --> 46:15.380
Let me start over.

46:15.380 --> 46:16.580
Let me start at the beginning.

46:16.580 --> 46:18.100
So there was this old lady, right?

46:19.460 --> 46:22.500
All right, so I'm an old lady also.

46:23.140 --> 46:28.100
And my nephew keeps egging me on with these vine pranks.

46:28.100 --> 46:29.540
You want to see a magic trick?

46:33.540 --> 46:34.580
Want to see a magic trick?

46:34.580 --> 46:40.340
I have a Shetland pony inside my burrk.

46:44.340 --> 46:46.980
Why, you sounds bad.

46:46.980 --> 46:50.020
Because I've been standing for 40 minutes, Mr. Joker.

46:50.900 --> 46:55.780
I've been standing for so long and I want to be an agent of chaos like you,

46:55.780 --> 46:58.020
but I had to stand the whole time.

46:58.980 --> 46:59.700
This sucks.

46:59.700 --> 47:10.660
You think if you're a veterinarian and someone walks in with a parrot,

47:10.660 --> 47:12.340
you're like, oh, tell them we're closed.

47:16.340 --> 47:18.500
You deal with cats and dogs every day.

47:18.500 --> 47:19.620
You're good at those.

47:19.620 --> 47:20.900
You feel comfortable.

47:20.900 --> 47:22.820
You feel confident dealing with a cat.

47:22.820 --> 47:25.380
How often do you deal like a session?

47:25.380 --> 47:27.140
Maybe you're like a small town vet.

47:27.140 --> 47:30.740
If somebody brings in a big fancy bird, you're like, I'm going to fuck that up.

47:31.860 --> 47:34.820
I haven't done parrots in like 23 years.

47:34.820 --> 47:38.660
Please don't ask me anything about parrots.

47:38.660 --> 47:40.100
This is my pet octopus.

47:40.100 --> 47:40.740
Oh, boy.

47:40.740 --> 47:42.260
Okay, I think I can.

47:42.260 --> 47:45.060
I feel like I have a little bit of a margin of error.

47:49.380 --> 47:52.100
Let me make this argument as a vet, okay?

47:52.100 --> 47:56.420
Okay, I think as a veterinarian, you shouldn't work on animals

47:56.980 --> 47:59.940
that you could feed to other animals you work on.

47:59.940 --> 48:01.700
That seems insane to me, right?

48:01.700 --> 48:05.620
But the little old lady scenario, Justin, that could be anything.

48:05.620 --> 48:06.500
That's anything, yeah.

48:07.060 --> 48:08.500
That's a good point, I guess.

48:08.500 --> 48:11.780
When pushed to their limits, any animal can eat any other animal.

48:12.660 --> 48:15.700
I think I'm just saying, listen, this is my hot take.

48:15.700 --> 48:17.460
I think doctors have it easy.

48:17.460 --> 48:19.860
Doctors only got to work on one species.

48:19.860 --> 48:20.100
True.

48:20.100 --> 48:23.060
Veterinarians got to work on like all the other ones.

48:23.060 --> 48:26.820
Hey, doctors, fucking share the load with the veterinarians.

48:26.820 --> 48:27.860
Yes, they do.

48:27.860 --> 48:31.860
Veterinarians now do dogs, cats, and that's it.

48:31.860 --> 48:33.780
And doctors, you're still going to do people,

48:33.780 --> 48:35.380
but now you also have birds.

48:35.380 --> 48:36.100
Let's start-

48:36.100 --> 48:37.780
Birds and maybe horses.

48:37.780 --> 48:38.340
No, no, no, no.

48:39.220 --> 48:41.700
Because there's like farm vets that specialize in horses.

48:41.700 --> 48:42.500
True, true, true.

48:42.500 --> 48:43.220
Farm doctors.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.580
Farm doctors!

48:44.580 --> 48:51.700
I'm just saying, first step, the first step towards a more equal sort of situation,

48:52.580 --> 48:55.140
veterinarians give birds to the doctors.

48:55.140 --> 48:55.700
Yes.

48:55.700 --> 48:58.900
Every hospital is now also a bird hospital.

48:58.900 --> 49:02.500
And you know what, I'll say this, maybe there's some light stuff with humans,

49:02.500 --> 49:03.940
you can let vets take care of that.

49:04.900 --> 49:09.460
Now, I feel like you're losing the spirit of the arrangement we're trying to solve.

49:09.460 --> 49:12.500
But then if there's like a really big dog, that can go to doctors.

49:12.500 --> 49:14.100
Okay.

49:14.100 --> 49:15.860
We'll find a balance, we'll get there.

49:15.860 --> 49:20.820
So you think case by case, Travis's new job is for every hospital in the country,

49:20.820 --> 49:25.940
deciding if the patient is going to go to doctor, hospital, or veterinarian hospital.

49:25.940 --> 49:29.300
I'm saying that this is my new hit series that I'm pitching in BC,

49:29.860 --> 49:33.700
where it is a combination hospital and veterinarian hospital.

49:34.260 --> 49:39.140
And there's some drama, but definitely more on one side than the other.

49:39.140 --> 49:40.340
Okay, okay.

49:40.340 --> 49:43.620
I just want to see the break room where veterinarians and doctors compare notes

49:43.620 --> 49:45.940
and like, yeah, I also had a tough one today.

49:45.940 --> 49:47.380
A dog ate a Lego man.

49:50.100 --> 49:51.060
Should we end the show?

49:52.100 --> 49:56.020
I feel like that's a tough, it's tough for us to answer that fairly, isn't it?

49:56.020 --> 49:56.820
Yes.

49:56.820 --> 49:57.140
It is.

49:57.140 --> 49:57.860
In this moment.

49:57.860 --> 50:03.620
I just rolled my office chair over my toes, so I don't really like to end the show.

50:03.620 --> 50:05.540
Think about how good the sitting will be.

50:05.540 --> 50:07.780
It's going to be so good.

50:07.780 --> 50:11.220
The sitting will be good and it'll be well-earned, I would say.

50:11.220 --> 50:15.860
I keep doing stuff, like lifting my shirt up to like vent it and like, you know, scratching.

50:15.860 --> 50:19.060
And then I realized that I have a big open patio door behind me

50:19.060 --> 50:21.620
and people can see my stuff and I don't like that.

50:21.620 --> 50:22.580
We love it.

50:22.580 --> 50:27.620
I at some point in recording, and I can't remember why, put on a second belt,

50:27.620 --> 50:30.340
but not through the belt loops, just wrapped it around my hip.

50:30.340 --> 50:34.100
All right, we're all doing some unconscious stuff, yeah.

50:34.100 --> 50:43.220
Yeah, I want to say a big thank you to Laura Kate Dale for coming onto our podcast.

50:43.860 --> 50:46.020
Bullying her way on, I think it's fair.

50:46.020 --> 50:47.860
Like in a healthy way.

50:47.860 --> 50:48.580
Healthy bullying.

50:48.580 --> 50:49.860
In a healthy, productive way.

50:50.980 --> 50:53.140
Uncomfortable Labels is the name of Laura's book.

50:53.140 --> 50:54.740
Go buy it now.

50:55.540 --> 50:58.900
Also, if you could this week, please buy our book,

50:58.900 --> 51:02.820
The Adventure Zone, volume two, Murder on the Rockport Limited,

51:02.820 --> 51:05.460
which maybe the volume two is probably at the end or it may not even have it.

51:05.460 --> 51:06.980
There's a two in there, probably somewhere,

51:06.980 --> 51:09.460
but it's The Adventure Zone, Murder on the Rockport Limited.

51:10.340 --> 51:13.380
If you, it helps us the most if you buy it this first week,

51:13.380 --> 51:16.420
because it's, I don't know, book sales are weird and archaic,

51:16.420 --> 51:18.900
but if you could buy it this week, that would be great.

51:19.460 --> 51:20.980
And I think it's a really fun book.

51:20.980 --> 51:22.980
If you've read the first one, you know that it's good,

51:22.980 --> 51:24.500
and this one's on a train, so.

51:24.500 --> 51:26.420
Even better, even better.

51:26.420 --> 51:31.380
If you can, maybe go to your local bookstore, see if they're getting in, check with them.

51:31.380 --> 51:32.500
Check with them.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.820
Yeah, buy up all those copies, tell them to get more.

51:35.460 --> 51:39.940
Speaking of comic books, this week is also San Diego Comic Con,

51:40.500 --> 51:44.500
which we are going to be at with various different events and stuff.

51:44.500 --> 51:49.700
If you want to see the events, I'm sure we'll have it up on McElroy.family at some point,

51:49.700 --> 51:54.260
but you can also go to my brand new revamped TravisMcElroy.com and right there.

51:54.260 --> 51:55.300
Here he goes.

51:55.300 --> 51:56.020
All right.

51:56.020 --> 51:56.820
Click on the schedule.

51:56.820 --> 51:59.780
Also, the Cincinnati Underground Society Show,

51:59.780 --> 52:02.020
which I don't talk often about on the podcast,

52:02.020 --> 52:06.340
but it's a semi-regular show we do here in Cincinnati.

52:06.340 --> 52:09.140
We're now offering lifetime memberships for it

52:09.140 --> 52:12.020
that come with a bunch of other really cool swag and benefits and stuff.

52:12.580 --> 52:15.060
You can buy those also on TravisMcElroy.com.

52:15.060 --> 52:18.340
And I just realized we forgot to talk about, along with the book coming out,

52:18.340 --> 52:19.940
we're doing book tour.

52:19.940 --> 52:20.260
Yeah.

52:20.260 --> 52:25.220
We're coming to New York, Austin, LA.

52:25.220 --> 52:25.700
Portland.

52:25.700 --> 52:27.700
Portland's already sold out, but we will be in Portland.

52:27.700 --> 52:28.420
We'll see you there.

52:28.420 --> 52:30.260
LA, and I think San Diego's sold out too.

52:30.260 --> 52:31.700
Go to McElroy.family.

52:31.700 --> 52:32.740
Click on tours.

52:32.740 --> 52:34.660
There's tickets there for the book tour shows.

52:34.660 --> 52:35.780
Please come to the LA show.

52:35.780 --> 52:36.580
Please, please, please.

52:36.580 --> 52:37.540
Yeah, come on.

52:37.540 --> 52:38.260
Thanks to John.

52:38.260 --> 52:39.220
Come on, cowards.

52:39.220 --> 52:39.860
Come on.

52:39.860 --> 52:41.380
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

52:41.380 --> 52:42.820
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

52:42.820 --> 52:44.340
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

52:44.900 --> 52:45.700
Great album.

52:45.700 --> 52:46.500
Great song.

52:46.500 --> 52:47.060
Great website.

52:47.060 --> 52:47.860
Travel a lot right now.

52:47.860 --> 52:48.740
It looks professional.

52:49.300 --> 52:50.180
Thank you.

52:50.180 --> 52:53.540
It was done by Eric Enloe, Courtney Enloe's brother,

52:53.540 --> 52:55.300
and he did an amazing job.

52:55.300 --> 52:56.900
I'm really, really pleased with it.

52:56.900 --> 52:59.220
So also, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

53:07.780 --> 53:09.060

53:09.060 --> 53:10.420

53:10.420 --> 53:11.220

53:11.220 --> 53:11.940
Oh, one more thing.

53:11.940 --> 53:13.060

Got a bunch of new merch, including Monster Factory merch.

53:15.700 --> 53:16.180
Yeah.

53:16.180 --> 53:16.900
Brand new.

53:16.900 --> 53:18.420
And I think it's absolutely beautiful.

53:18.420 --> 53:18.980
Go check it out.

53:18.980 --> 53:20.500

Madeline sent this one in.

53:21.540 --> 53:22.100
Thanks, Madeline.

53:22.100 --> 53:25.140
It's from Yahoo Answers user, well, shoot.

53:25.140 --> 53:30.580
Darth Beaver, who asks.

53:30.580 --> 53:31.700
Oh, beans.

53:31.700 --> 53:31.940
Yep.

53:32.660 --> 53:34.820
I went to my first ballet last night.

53:34.820 --> 53:36.740
What is with all the ladies toe dancing?

53:36.740 --> 53:38.580
Why don't they just hire taller women?

53:42.260 --> 53:44.580
Why are you just McElroy?
