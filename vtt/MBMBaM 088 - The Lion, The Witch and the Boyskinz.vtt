00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:50.960
Hello, this is My Brother, My Brother, and Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

00:52.720 --> 00:59.200
This week we are protesting SOPA and PIPA, which are two beats of legislation

00:59.200 --> 01:10.800
that, if passed, could kill the internet forever. Just dead as it could be.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.960
So this week, in protest of SOPA and PIPA, we have removed, we've blacked out,

01:18.960 --> 01:22.400
if you will, the comedy from this week's episode.

01:22.400 --> 01:28.720
Let me give you guys an example of what we're talking about.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.360
Guys, why are we protesting the Spanish word for soup?

01:34.080 --> 01:35.520
See, that joke wasn't very funny.

01:37.120 --> 01:41.520
And that's the kind of joke, non-joke, you're going to expect this week.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.880
It's public domain jokes.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.120
It's a public domain freeware joke.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.760
This is the one I came up with.

01:47.760 --> 01:53.520
Okay. I don't know what the big deal is. Without SOPA, how am I supposed to wash up?

01:55.120 --> 02:00.400
See, that's a very open source, free share, share to play,

02:01.440 --> 02:08.960
microtransaction joke that we are expecting to populate the entirety of this SOPA special edition.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.920
We can also use jokes that have entered the public domain

02:11.920 --> 02:18.320
simply by their sheer age being over and including 75 years old.

02:18.320 --> 02:23.600
So Griffin, if I were to say to you, why did the chicken cross SOPA?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.920
I don't know, Justin, why?

02:26.640 --> 02:27.920
Betty Grable!

02:28.880 --> 02:35.120
That is an example of an old joke that I can use this week.

02:36.080 --> 02:40.240
Okay. I'm getting this just in. SOPA was apparently defeated this week.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.200
We did it.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.160
We did it.

02:42.160 --> 02:42.640
You're welcome.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.640
I'm really proud of everybody.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.160
It's a proud share moment here on My Brother and My Brother and Me.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.840
I'm your oldest brother and oldest, well, oldest victor, if you will.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.300
Victor.

02:54.080 --> 02:54.640
McElroy.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.200
I'm your middle-est brother and champion, Travis McElroy.

02:59.920 --> 03:06.240
I am Griffin McElroy, the flag bearer of the army, the internet army.

03:06.240 --> 03:06.720
Anonymous.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.680
Internet army.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.480
I am anonymous.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.440
I'm sorry that it had to come out like this, but I am him.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.760
I am Deadmau5.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.080
Okay.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.520
And I'm Spuds McKenzie.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.800
Let's go fight the internet.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.200
I am Killroy, 75 years old.

03:26.080 --> 03:26.880
Let's get them.

03:26.880 --> 03:30.800
My girlfriend and I were planning to go on a double date last night

03:30.800 --> 03:32.720
with a couple of our friends who live five minutes away.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.480
Me and the lady hang around the apartment doing for an hour without hearing from them

03:36.480 --> 03:42.800
until we get a call at 1040 saying we should just meet at the restaurant to save time.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.640
The nearby restaurant closes at 11.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.480
My girlfriend and I were uncomfortable being party to the under the wire dining habits,

03:52.480 --> 03:54.800
so we politely told them we'd have to decline.

03:54.800 --> 04:00.080
I feel bad for bailing on our plans, but I'd feel just as bad being complicit in their plan

04:00.080 --> 04:02.800
to show up at a sit-down restaurant 10 minutes before closing.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.720
Did we do the right thing?

04:04.720 --> 04:06.960
And that's from Nonplussed in North Carolina.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.800
Of course you did the right thing.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.960
Yeah, for a number of people.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.080
For a number of reasons.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.960
First off, you shouldn't eat anything after like eight o'clock or else it just goes that's

04:16.960 --> 04:21.440
you just convert it straight into sleep and energy, which is to say fat on your loins.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.760
That's that's carb heavy too.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.600
Yeah, tortillas, sopas, pipas.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.800
Sopa pipas.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.600
Sopa pipas.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.320
Can I get another order of sopa pipas, please?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.640
Just the cold gazpacho sopa.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.920
And secondly, who the hell are these friends?

04:39.920 --> 04:41.920
They're calling you at 10 40 p.m.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.160
Be like, hey, let's go grab some dinner.

04:44.960 --> 04:45.920
That's not dinner.

04:45.920 --> 04:46.800
That's fourth meal.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.800
They want you to go get fourth meal.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.960
Wait, was this Mexican restaurant Taco Bell?

04:52.960 --> 04:55.520
The finest sit down Mexican restaurant in town.

04:56.160 --> 05:00.880
Me and Tracy, we're going to go to get fourth meal at Taco Bell,

05:00.880 --> 05:06.160
then take in a late showing of the crazy homeless guy running around the library.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.480
Are you in for this evening of glad?

05:08.480 --> 05:09.920
Dinner and theater?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.120
I'll be there.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.480
And theater?

05:12.480 --> 05:13.920
Couples night out.

05:13.920 --> 05:18.160
The homeless man stops running at 12 30 and we should get there right around 12 15.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.760
So everything should work out just great.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.520
From working in at least two restaurants that I can remember right now,

05:25.520 --> 05:30.720
there is nothing worse than like you've already you started your clean up and like closing duties.

05:30.720 --> 05:36.320
And, you know, you're just finishing out your last tables and somebody rolls up with like a party of people.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.560
I'm like, hey, you guys aren't closed yet.

05:38.560 --> 05:45.760
Are you like, well, no, they might not spit in your food, but you're going to get a lot of fuck you in that food.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.600
And it's going to affect the flavor.

05:47.600 --> 05:52.400
I believe it was Carla in season five of Top Chef who made her way into the final three

05:52.400 --> 05:56.000
contestants by putting love into her food.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
This would be the opposite of that, where it would be pure unbridled spite.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
They take some love out of the food.

06:02.000 --> 06:02.800
Yeah, yeah.

06:02.800 --> 06:10.400
This tastes dry to me and I think advice like for future reference.

06:10.400 --> 06:16.400
I think the problem is not setting a specific time beforehand and waiting for them to call you.

06:16.400 --> 06:21.200
Especially these sounds like the type of people that do not adhere to normal people.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.400
Do not adhere to normal person schedules.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.600
Any fourth meal at 1040 p.m.

06:27.600 --> 06:35.600
So maybe the next time you're going to make plans with them, nail down like a realistic time to go eat dinner or just stop making doing.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.000
Maybe they're not plans friends.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.400
Oh, yeah, they can be they can be friends.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.200
Just not like double date friends.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.400
We've all been like that.

06:43.400 --> 06:49.400
Oh, they can be like run into at a party friends or like invite over it like you invite them to all your social events.

06:49.400 --> 06:54.000
Just don't make them the only thing in the social event because they're going to show up an hour and a half late and they're going to.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh, I forgot to bring beer.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
I'll get you next time.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
They won't get you next time.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.200
There is no next time.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.700
They'll bail.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.200
Those people would rather move than show up on time.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.900
Yeah, you can't build your world around them.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.200
Hey, dear McElroy's.

07:08.200 --> 07:12.000
I'm in high school and there's this certain kid who's a total bully.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.600
He and his group gang up and beat down anyone they so well, please.

07:17.600 --> 07:22.100
Both myself and many of my friends have reported him in his group, but he never gets any punishment.

07:22.100 --> 07:32.100
Would it be okay for me to get a bunch of my friends to teach him a lesson or would I simply be escalating the conflict heroic high school?

07:32.100 --> 07:35.500
Oh, no, would it be okay?

07:35.500 --> 07:37.200
Absolutely not.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.600
Yeah, it's not okay like you.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.500
Yes, you will be escalating because that's the definition of the thing.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.900
Yeah, that's the definition of escalate.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.600
Do you know how bullies get to be bullies?

07:47.600 --> 07:50.900
They have mean dads that beat them up and will beat other kids up.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.400
Is that what you want?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.900
You want to escalate your problem from bully to mean dad?

07:54.900 --> 07:56.800
And also look at this for the future.

07:56.800 --> 08:09.900
If you and a bunch of your friends jump him, he's not going to go, you know, I see your point now and I've decided he's going to wait till the next time you're alone and him and a bunch of his friends are going to jump you.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.100
Yeah, you've got to stride right up to him.

08:12.100 --> 08:18.800
You got to tap on the shoulder and say, excuse me, sir, and then deck him and then change schools.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.200
You leave her alone, Biff.

08:22.200 --> 08:32.100
I'm your son from the future and you've been beating me up and I travel back in time to tell you don't do that.

08:32.100 --> 08:35.100
But every time I try to tell you before you beat me up.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.100
It's awkward.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.100
Maybe you should befriend him.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.100
This is they see here.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.100
We're getting closer to actionable advice now.

08:44.100 --> 08:48.600
You gotta I think all three of us can speak to this.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.600
You gotta lean into it.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.600
You gotta you gotta write that wave.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.600
You gotta write that write that wave to graduation day.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.600
And I swear to you, you'll get through.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
Are you wait?

08:59.600 --> 09:03.900
Are you encouraging him to like demand beating?

09:03.900 --> 09:04.500
Oh, no.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.600
Just eat it when they come.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.600
Just take them.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.400
Have it.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.300
Just grow from it.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.600
Dive at the floor.

09:10.600 --> 09:16.100
Let his let his punishment become the fertilizer for your maturity tree.

09:16.100 --> 09:24.300
You know, you don't want to end up like bright eyes and only get beat up enough to have enough material for two to three solo independent singer songwriter albums.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.600
You need to be beat up enough that you can have a career of it.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.100
You want a Connor Ober's level of getting beat up in high school.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.000
Okay, that's that's where we're headed.

09:33.000 --> 09:33.700
Look at that.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.700
We want to make you a star.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.100
Let's use Ben Gibbard.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.300
That's a way better example.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.700
Probably got the shit knocked out of his face every day.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.500
And then what happened?

09:42.500 --> 09:45.000
He released a bunch of great albums married Zooey Deschanel.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.200
That one didn't work out so well, but but everything was a beat her up now about that.

09:51.200 --> 09:57.000
You left all your goddamn sweaters lying around again bed.

09:57.000 --> 10:05.600
I'm tired of cleaning or you could do what I did when I got picked on and I hit him with a trombone case.

10:05.600 --> 10:11.800
So you're talking about you're talking about weaponized school supplies.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.500
Yeah.

10:12.500 --> 10:21.500
Well, I think that the idea of like getting a group of people together not cool, but like yeah challenging him to an honorable duel trombone cases at dawn.

10:21.500 --> 10:26.300
Yeah, then you don't think one-on-one fight might solve this.

10:26.300 --> 10:30.300
No, I don't think that two guys hitting each other with a trombone.

10:30.300 --> 10:35.300
That sounds like a mating call for bullies to come in like a bigger bully to come see that fight.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.600
And that's not bullying.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.100
I'll show you both you bullying.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.100
Oh, you need to find a bigger bully to bully your bully.

10:41.100 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, no, that doesn't make any sense.

10:45.000 --> 10:45.600
Hey, why don't you?

10:45.600 --> 10:49.200
Hey guys, why don't you hire Owen Wilson to come and protect you and your friends?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.800
It worked on an episode of Doug.

10:51.800 --> 10:57.300
Why don't you get your secret agent dad to come protect you like a Klogen dagger?

10:57.300 --> 11:03.200
Why don't you call Rick Moranis and help you win the big triathlon sports triathlon?

11:03.200 --> 11:11.000
Why don't you get the former fat guy for the fat kids camp to come over and teach you how to be good at volleyball?

11:11.000 --> 11:14.900
I don't even know how this helped with the bullying anymore.

11:14.900 --> 11:21.500
Why don't you go and with a bunch of your friends and Christopher Lloyd open up your own summer camp because you hate going to piano camp so much.

11:21.500 --> 11:25.200
And then on the last day at camp you have to put together a parents day.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.400
Did you just pull out camp nowhere?

11:28.400 --> 11:30.900
I might have pulled that out of my quiver, yes.

11:30.900 --> 11:38.900
You and your friends just learn how to change into cars and then back into robots and then fight the bad robots because you're transformers.

11:38.900 --> 11:43.400
And by this point you've graduated.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.400
So yeah, by now you've graduated.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.700
Oh man.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.900
I'm sorry that we're not more helpful.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.200
I don't think any of that helps.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.600
If we knew how to deal with bullies, we wouldn't be in this situation.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.900
High school sucks dick.

11:56.900 --> 11:57.700
Which I mean our lives.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.900
High school sucks more than anything but then it's over and it's awesome.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.400
Yeah, it'll get better.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.900
The bully will get tired of it eventually.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.400
He's gonna get worn out from punching you.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.200
He's gonna get winded.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.600
That's the real victory.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.400
And then you curl up into a ball and you cry.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.700
You cry so hard.

12:16.700 --> 12:20.600
I do want to make this clear though.

12:20.600 --> 12:25.200
Don't get a big group of people to fight that guy because then you're a bully.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.300
You're like a gang bully.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.500
Yeah, you are a gang.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.000
You're a gangster at that point and that's a rhyme.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.200
That's how people start gangs to protect themselves from bullies.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.000
Just wait it out and stay hidden in the shadows.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.800
Guys, this Yahoo answer was sent in by Chuck Jones.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.600
Thanks Chuck Jones.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.800
It's so good.

12:45.800 --> 12:53.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gary who asks, thongs for men in parentheses bully skins?

12:53.600 --> 13:00.400
Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew where the website boy skins is gone.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.000
I wanted to buy a thong form there, but saw they no longer wear up.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.300
I also wanted to buy my son one since he saw mine and wanted to try it.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.800
No, I'm not a pedo.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.100
He's 15 and can speak for himself.

13:12.100 --> 13:12.500
Thanks.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.100
Does anyone know where I can buy adult and youth boy thongs?

13:16.100 --> 13:16.700
Thanks.

13:16.700 --> 13:23.400
Boy skins, if you couldn't tell from my pronunciation, does have a Z up on it.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.100
Is there a Y?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.400
No Y.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.600
There is a Y.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.900
At the end of boy, but not men skins, not mid skin.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.300
It would have been better if it was boi skins, but I was not so lucky.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.800
Trademark ever living.

13:38.800 --> 13:44.000
Where did boy skins go?

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
I've been cruising over to that website, not for any other reason than it was a good way

13:49.000 --> 13:53.200
to check my bandwidth speeds because there are some high-res images.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.900
I mean, to put it to put it mildly, the phrase doesn't even do it justice.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.800
Hey, dad.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.800
Hey, Papa.

13:58.800 --> 14:03.100
I cannot help but notice that stylish man thong.

14:03.100 --> 14:08.900
Is there a place where I, a 15 year old lad, could purchase one of those man thongs?

14:08.900 --> 14:10.700
Boy skins, you say?

14:10.700 --> 14:12.300
Well, let's check it out right now.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.200
What a disappointment.

14:15.200 --> 14:21.000
Now I'll have to go bully all those kids at school.

14:21.000 --> 14:21.700
Come here.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.500
I'm mad at you.

14:22.500 --> 14:26.000
My pants are so loose.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.900
If only he had the support he craved.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.500
I actually, I haven't been on the boy skin site in a while.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.400
I wasn't aware it disappeared.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.800
I had it in my RSS feed.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.400
I had subscribed to their updates and I wasn't getting them anymore.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.000
The newsletter stopped coming.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.400
It really should have, that really should have been a telltale sign.

14:43.400 --> 14:48.600
Can we not get a groupon on this?

14:48.600 --> 14:51.800
You can get a groupon, but everybody has to share the same thong.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.600
So it becomes very, there's some hygiene issues.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.700
Yeah, right.

14:55.700 --> 15:00.200
There's nothing worse than waiting for your friend in a Mexican restaurant to get your thong for the day.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.900
Why is, why is this a thing?

15:03.900 --> 15:09.800
Everyone in the answers is saying go to Kmart and Walmart.

15:09.800 --> 15:14.600
As if that's, how do they, how is that, do they have those there?

15:14.600 --> 15:18.200
I know from personal experience that Walmart does not have sock garters.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.200
So I really doubt they have man thongs.

15:20.200 --> 15:25.700
Can we call them boy skins from now on and also can we call our podcast boy skins from now on?

15:25.700 --> 15:36.300
Hey, in the effort to actually give this person a helpful answer, I just googled boy skins and boy do I regret it.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.100
I shouldn't have done that.

15:39.100 --> 15:44.800
And if there are any government agents now monitoring my like DSL usage, I'm sorry.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.900
Very sorry, I didn't mean to do it.

15:46.900 --> 15:51.000
Is boy skins, I don't see a website called boy skins.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.200
I see a lot of usernames named boy skins and a Yahoo, a YouTube channel called boy skins.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.200
So I'm thinking that this person's trying to start some branding.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.800
Oh, all these accounts are closed.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.200
I'm trying to Nancy Drew this shit, but.

16:04.200 --> 16:09.200
Boy skins just fell off the face, well, fell off the butt of the internet, let's be honest.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.500
About a, nope, fuck.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.400
No, you can't find boy skins anywhere.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.300
There's a, there's a blog spot called boy skin.

16:18.300 --> 16:22.100
Oh no, don't just go to boy skin at blog spot.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.800
Oh, it's dicks all over dicks for miles.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.400
How could this happen?

16:28.400 --> 16:37.700
Well, you know, in 20 years on an episode of storage wars, they'll open up a storage container and find this box after box label boy skins.

16:37.700 --> 16:43.300
And they'd be looking at going, you know, the most kids are worth, that's like a thousand dollars a box right there.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.200
I'm seeing like $6,000 in thongs.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.600
Is that a Hummel boy skin?

16:47.600 --> 16:50.400
I can tell that looks like a Hummel boy skin.

16:50.400 --> 16:56.900
I was hoping that they were going to find the boy skin website because I was curious how you were going to conceptualize that for me.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.200
Is that the domain name boy skins?

16:59.200 --> 17:07.000
There's a, underneath, underneath this, what appears to be an elderly woman sewing table folded up in the shelves here.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.300
There seems to be a website called boy skins.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.100
It's called boy skins.

17:10.100 --> 17:13.300
It's a little, it's become corporeal.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.500
It looks hungry.

17:15.500 --> 17:24.900
It seems now this looks like a regular cupboard, but when you open it and go inside, you exit on the other side into boy skins, the website.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.100
Have a look around its directories and indexes.

17:27.100 --> 17:30.400
You're going to like what you see.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.000
You're going to be horrified at the way you look.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.300
I guarantee it.

17:33.300 --> 17:36.500
So, Mr. Tumnus, you look fantastic.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.300
Very smelt.

17:37.300 --> 17:41.900
How did you get the tiny holes over your furry legs, Mr.

17:41.900 --> 17:42.500
Tumnus?

17:42.500 --> 17:48.100
God, that is really doing some, it is shaping you very attractively.

17:48.100 --> 17:54.000
That is the most vivid mental picture I think we've ever created on this show.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I can't, I can't.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.700
It's like, I can't get it out.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.300
And if you could see in my head, the look Mr.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.800
Tumnus is giving me is troubling.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.900
I'm angry.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.400
It's not like a seductive look.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.700
He's angry that I'm there.

18:06.700 --> 18:12.600
I'm forming this sentence with my mouth and speaking it with the power from my brain,

18:12.600 --> 18:18.800
but I'm only dedicating about 1% of my brain to that task because the other 99% is dreaming

18:18.800 --> 18:21.900
up this visage and I can't.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.400
I've been meaning to correct you children.

18:25.400 --> 18:29.500
It's pronounced ass land.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
Oh, Jesus.

18:31.500 --> 18:35.600
Oh God, why is everyone in Narnia in my head and wearing thongs?

18:35.600 --> 18:37.000
It's Father Christmas.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.700
Truly, I've brought you gifts.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.300
Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.800
I've brought you gifts to help defend the kingdom.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.700
They're all boy skins.

18:48.700 --> 18:49.700
A sword?

18:49.700 --> 18:52.600
No, a sword sheath of a sort.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.400
Do you like Turkish delights?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.100
No, but I love some boy skins.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.200
Those are delightful enough.

18:59.200 --> 19:04.600
Let me just write down the lion, the witch, and the boy skins right now.

19:04.600 --> 19:10.600
You know what you never find on storage wars?

19:10.600 --> 19:17.700
They never just open it up and it's just a bunch of wolverines.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.200
They open it up and they're just swarmed with like badgers.

19:20.200 --> 19:25.000
Do you think they would still bet on it?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.400
There's money in wolverines.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
Their teeth.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.400
Their teeth are very precious.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.400
Is anybody being mauled by a wolverine?

19:32.400 --> 19:33.400
Yep.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.400
Nope.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
Christ.

19:35.400 --> 19:40.500
Has there ever been an episode where they open up and there's just like a dead person

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
in there?

19:41.500 --> 19:42.500
That's a nice watch.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
Look at his belt.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.500
That's a nice belt.

19:44.500 --> 19:49.200
Dave found some bones once and sold them for like 15 grand.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.200
No joke.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.200
Good work, Dave.

19:51.200 --> 19:57.000
At one point, oh I remember that episode because at one point Dave commented that there was

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
a hand and then he said, and this is an even bigger hand so it's got to be worth more.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.800
And the lady's like, oh that's a foot.

20:04.800 --> 20:10.400
Oh man, Dave, you're so fucking stupid.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.400
How'd you get so big?

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400
You stupid bitch.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.320
You stupid idiot.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.320
So recently.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.440
Anyone got some bones I can have?

20:18.440 --> 20:21.200
Can I have anyone's bones please?

20:21.200 --> 20:23.200
They're very expensive.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.200
Yep.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.200
Bones.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.200
Bones.

20:26.200 --> 20:39.020
So recently, it's come to my attention that a girl I liked thought I was kind of creepy.

20:39.020 --> 20:45.200
She still likes me as a friend, but my awkward attempts at courtship just creeped her off.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.040
How do I stop being creepy?

20:47.040 --> 20:48.880
That's from the Chicago Creep Show.

20:48.880 --> 20:53.520
I don't know if that's a typo or not, but I'm really enamored with the phrase creeped

20:53.520 --> 20:54.520
her off.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.520
Creeped her off.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
Creep me clean off.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.520
Listen, I'm creeped off.

20:57.520 --> 21:04.640
I got to be honest with you, I'm creeped off right now.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.240
Do you know what I think creepiness is?

21:06.240 --> 21:11.280
I think there's a lot of people that are creepy out there, and I see them, and I experience

21:11.280 --> 21:16.440
them, and I experience they're creepy.

21:16.440 --> 21:21.280
I think that it is mostly, no joke, like a lack of confidence.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.200
I think if you're not confident in yourself, that's the creepiest, that's like a straight

21:25.200 --> 21:26.720
like rocket carted creepy town.

21:26.720 --> 21:32.560
Well, yeah, but you got to watch out because that's like a, you can go over the edge and

21:32.560 --> 21:34.040
then you're into like sleazy.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.040
Yeah.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.920
Yeah, but there's also, but yeah, I think Griffin's right.

21:37.920 --> 21:41.640
I think a lot of creepiness comes from second guessing yourself, where people think of you

21:41.640 --> 21:45.300
as like a creepier or perhaps a weird beard.

21:45.300 --> 21:51.440
It's because you're constantly evaluating the situation, your response to it in a way

21:51.440 --> 21:54.320
that people don't feel a connection.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.440
If you connect with people, they're never going to feel like you're a creepster unless

21:57.440 --> 22:02.360
you're like way deep down to the core creepy, creepy cored out.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.720
I think that people are so afraid that they're incapable of making that connection though,

22:06.720 --> 22:12.600
that they go the whole like the mentality of, oh, this is awkward, isn't it?

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
Like yeah.

22:13.600 --> 22:17.080
Or you do like even worse, like you pass notes and like you just kind of stare at them from

22:17.080 --> 22:20.280
a distance and wave because you're too afraid to just like talk to them.

22:20.280 --> 22:25.680
Like your ineptitude in this region isn't, it's not charming, it is creepy.

22:25.680 --> 22:29.240
It's how you creep people off and you should stop doing that.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.240
That's how they get creeped off.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.120
Yeah, I think it's just like anything else, right?

22:33.120 --> 22:39.200
Get interested in other people because if you can do that, you're going to be a lot

22:39.200 --> 22:42.880
less absorbed with how you're coming off in a given situation.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.640
I think that's where that self-awareness, and that's something that a lot of people

22:46.640 --> 22:52.000
struggle with, even if they aren't necessarily creepy, that sort of being obsessed with your

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
self-awareness and your inner critic can make you seem off-putting to people.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.040
Just be careful about putting people on a pedestal and just realize that everybody is

23:02.040 --> 23:08.180
equal and if there's a connection there, you're only going to find it by like talking to them

23:08.180 --> 23:13.080
and approaching them and getting to know them, not from a distance.

23:13.080 --> 23:19.440
Also be aware of, some of that creepiness can come from if you get kind of obsessed

23:19.440 --> 23:26.880
with a girl or a boy and spend a little too much time just showing up at their next class

23:26.880 --> 23:32.040
and that kind of thing.

23:32.040 --> 23:38.040
It's scarier to face the possibility of just being straight out, shot down.

23:38.040 --> 23:42.720
You walk up and say, hey, I think we should get coffee sometime and they're like, no,

23:42.720 --> 23:48.440
that's scary and so sometimes it's easier to just try to incrementally get to know them

23:48.440 --> 23:51.280
and that's what's creepy.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.880
That's a great point, Trevor.

23:52.880 --> 23:58.440
A lot of that can come from this erosion style of seduction where you're just going to wear

23:58.440 --> 24:06.220
the person down through virtue of exposure or time and it's rarely ever effective.

24:06.220 --> 24:12.440
What you usually end up doing is wearing down your own charm because it gets a little exasperating

24:12.440 --> 24:18.400
where the person's probably thinking after the second time, who is this person?

24:18.400 --> 24:23.680
They haven't even really introduced themselves to me yet and then pretty soon they're looking

24:23.680 --> 24:25.560
at you as creepy.

24:25.560 --> 24:31.480
I think that this is like anything else, as far as self-improvement is concerned, you're

24:31.480 --> 24:36.440
not going to wake up tomorrow and not be creepy anymore.

24:36.440 --> 24:40.680
All of a sudden you'll wake up one day and realize that you're not creepy anymore.

24:40.680 --> 24:45.900
You won't even be thinking about it by that point, but this isn't like, I have decided

24:45.900 --> 24:46.900
to no longer be creepy.

24:46.900 --> 24:47.900
How do you dig out of it then, Trav?

24:47.900 --> 24:50.280
How do you get out of the creepy hole?

24:50.280 --> 24:55.040
I think it's just by making the decision today, like I'm going to be more straightforward,

24:55.040 --> 25:03.040
I'm going to be more confident and then don't hold yourself to that standard from day one,

25:03.040 --> 25:04.040
you know what I mean?

25:04.040 --> 25:06.040
Because that will make you more self-critical.

25:06.040 --> 25:15.200
And hey, don't be afraid to change the direction of your affections.

25:15.200 --> 25:19.820
This person thinks you're creepy, it could also just be that they don't know what the

25:19.820 --> 25:24.000
hell they're talking about and you're not a good relationship match for them.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.160
The chemistry is not there.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.520
Don't beat your head against a rock.

25:27.520 --> 25:31.460
If you're not feeling the connection, you're cool too.

25:31.460 --> 25:36.080
And I think creepy is one of those words that can be like a really scary buzzword because

25:36.080 --> 25:41.080
all of a sudden you feel like, oh my God, I've done the exact wrong thing.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.680
It's not like, I don't like him or he's uninteresting.

25:43.680 --> 25:50.600
Creepy is like this, oh no, I've ruined it, I'm a terrible person.

25:50.600 --> 25:56.160
Also don't send people pictures of you hugging a body pillow that you photoshopped their

25:56.160 --> 25:58.920
face onto.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.920
It seems like a great move.

26:00.920 --> 26:07.000
Don't send gift baskets to people's parents to try and get them to like you, to get their

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
kids to like you.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.440
To Janet and Richard, congratulations on your 33rd anniversary.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.280
I'm so very proud of you.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.120
Your daughter is beautiful.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.320
Can I have her in exchange for this basket I need?

26:19.320 --> 26:29.280
And hey, barring everything else, you can always pay them.

26:29.280 --> 26:33.560
The only way you can do that, like to say like, no, hold on, creepy bail?

26:33.560 --> 26:36.760
No, it's like a transition.

26:36.760 --> 26:40.040
But like you're paying them to not think you're creepy?

26:40.040 --> 26:41.040
Let me out.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.040
Have you ever seen Can't Buy Me Love?

26:42.040 --> 26:44.320
Let me out of the creepy jail in your mind.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.320
I want out.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.320
Here's a hundo.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.320
Here's a hundo.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.320
Is this bail?

26:50.320 --> 26:51.880
Is this creepy bail that I'm paying?

26:51.880 --> 26:56.240
And of course, how else can you get your creepy bail together than with a trip to the Money

26:56.240 --> 27:00.120
Zone?

27:00.120 --> 27:10.800
You know who's never creepy?

27:10.800 --> 27:11.800
Who?

27:11.800 --> 27:12.800
John Cusack.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.800
Elite Q Studios.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.800
No, John Cusack.

27:14.800 --> 27:20.000
No, John Cusack is freely, if there's a guy outside your window with a boombox above his

27:20.000 --> 27:22.760
head, he better look like John Cusack, because he is a humba.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.920
And he better look like 1980s John Cusack.

27:24.920 --> 27:30.160
Yeah, oh yeah, not today's John Cusack, because today's John Cusack is Alan Rickman.

27:30.160 --> 27:34.600
Elite Q Studios is a little group that tries to make cool stuff.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.080
They got web comics, the main one's called Aloof.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.640
They have a podcast about cool freeware games.

27:39.640 --> 27:47.680
There's videos, there's articles, there's games, and there's other stuff sometimes.

27:47.680 --> 27:51.400
If you're in the mood for any one of those, and the last one's so general that you cannot

27:51.400 --> 27:52.400
actually deny that you're in the mood for it.

27:52.400 --> 27:57.880
You're in the mood for any things in the universe ever in the fullness of time.

27:57.880 --> 28:11.920
Open your mind to the expanse of infinity and visit eliteqstudios.net, that's O-L-E-E-T-K-U-S-T-U-D-I-O-S.net.

28:11.920 --> 28:23.600
You added an extra S on there, O-L-E-E-T-K-U-S-T-U-D-I-O-S.net.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.120
That's great, because now I don't have to do a jingle for them.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.120
Good.

28:27.120 --> 28:33.960
I got another message here for, this is for my man, Chris Flummer.

28:33.960 --> 28:41.480
Most people call him Flum, I call, I stick with Flummer, and his gamer tag is Flumdinger,

28:41.480 --> 28:42.480
maybe?

28:42.480 --> 28:49.240
The person who sent this to us, Melissa, his girlfriend, is not apparently sure what the

28:49.240 --> 28:56.080
Flummerino's gamer tag is, but she thinks, hey Flumminstein, what's your gamer tag?

28:56.080 --> 28:59.280
It could also be Flumdinger, but that makes a lot less sense.

28:59.280 --> 29:06.800
It's actually, his gamer tag is all one word, Flummer, starring Robin Williams.

29:06.800 --> 29:12.160
She wants him to know that she loves him, to have a happy B-day.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.960
He doesn't really like to celebrate his B-day, doesn't like anyone to give him a gift, because

29:15.960 --> 29:22.960
he doesn't want to be able to make a big deal, but now's the time to let that pass, because

29:22.960 --> 29:26.560
your girlfriend Melissa's gotten you this beautiful gift.

29:26.560 --> 29:34.080
She thinks that she wanted to pay us to tell you that you are Flum-believable, and we hope

29:34.080 --> 29:40.560
you have the very best birthday ever.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.520
Am I actually doing a jingle?

29:42.520 --> 29:53.520
So speaking of EliteKuStudios.net, here's a song from my man Griffin.

29:53.520 --> 29:57.280
I think I've done something on capo 5 before, let me drop it down to capo 3 and just like

29:57.280 --> 30:07.480
see where the progression takes me.

30:07.480 --> 30:15.000
If you want to watch some videos or read some articles or play some games or eat a sandwich

30:15.000 --> 30:23.480
or see the face of your newborn baby before it's bored, and if you like planes and cars

30:23.480 --> 30:29.840
and skies and rocket ships and planets and cans and glasses, both the kind that you wear

30:29.840 --> 30:39.400
on your face and the kind that you drink out of, if you like speakers and mice, if you

30:39.400 --> 30:48.240
like wallets and watches, if you like iron and calcium, if you like all of the things

30:48.240 --> 31:06.000
on the planet, you got to go to EliteKuStudios.org.net, god damn it, I'm definitely going to cut a

31:06.000 --> 31:15.080
verse out of that.

31:15.080 --> 31:21.520
The one thing you can't find at EliteKuStudios.net is the hilarious stylings, the maximum fun

31:21.520 --> 31:23.280
galaxy of stars.

31:23.280 --> 31:50.880
Here's one of them a-shinin' now.

31:53.880 --> 32:00.080
Here's a Yahoo answer that was sent in by Keenan Williams.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.080
Thank you Keenan.

32:01.080 --> 32:06.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user InterestingNews who asks, how many farts per day is normal

32:06.400 --> 32:07.400
amount?

32:07.400 --> 32:08.400
Go on.

32:08.400 --> 32:17.800
First off, let me apologize because there's a chance that we were, we made it onto the

32:17.800 --> 32:24.120
AV clubs podcast roundup for the first time and one of their action items was that, maybe

32:24.120 --> 32:26.080
not so much fart humor in it.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.600
So Griffin's response.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.840
I'm just going to peel it all, peel all of our fart humor off like a Band-Aid.

32:31.840 --> 32:32.840
Three.

32:32.840 --> 32:39.780
I mean, is this five and a half?

32:39.780 --> 32:42.600
Is this person looking for metric weight of farts?

32:42.600 --> 32:46.640
Yeah, is it like duration or amount?

32:46.640 --> 32:50.640
Because what if you had just like one fart, but it was really, really, really long?

32:50.640 --> 32:53.600
Is that worse or better than 10 tiny ones?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.680
I change my mind about this question.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.720
I don't think it's advisable.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.720
What's the matter, Justin?

32:58.720 --> 32:59.720
Are you ashamed of your body?

32:59.720 --> 33:00.720
In closing, four.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.120
Are you ashamed of the body God gave you and the sounds it makes?

33:04.120 --> 33:05.280
Jesus gave you that body.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.280
It's all natch.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.280
Don't worry.

33:07.280 --> 33:08.280
Jesus gave you farts.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.280
Yeah.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.480
I have to get the devil out.

33:11.480 --> 33:16.680
Farts are an eternal source of comedy as old as history itself.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.680
Oh, yes.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.680
One.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.160
It's like the Don Rickles of, well, it's just like Don Rickles.

33:22.160 --> 33:26.240
Have you ever seen that painting where God's reaching towards Adam?

33:26.240 --> 33:27.240
Yeah.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.720
He's saying, pull my finger.

33:28.720 --> 33:29.720
No, Travis.

33:29.720 --> 33:30.720
What?

33:30.720 --> 33:31.720
No?

33:31.720 --> 33:40.360
Travis just warped through time to be a dorm poster from the seventh century.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.520
See that, sopa?

33:41.520 --> 33:49.080
Can we come up- We're not only going to infringe on copyrights, we're going to travel through

33:49.080 --> 33:52.080
time to do it.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.280
Sorry, Orin Hatch.

33:55.280 --> 33:59.400
Suck my dick.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.880
Can we come up with another word for farts?

34:00.880 --> 34:03.880
Because we're going to be saying it a bunch during this question.

34:03.880 --> 34:04.880
Pilates.

34:04.880 --> 34:05.880
Tutoroobs.

34:05.880 --> 34:09.000
I was thinking of something more innocuous.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Flumdingers.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.840
Can we call them- Stinky bumblers.

34:13.840 --> 34:18.840
Can we call them butt songs?

34:18.840 --> 34:23.000
I think Nickelback will sue us for trademark infringement.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.160
You guys don't like bumpy stumblers, huh?

34:28.160 --> 34:31.000
I'll come up with something.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.840
How about broken flutes?

34:33.840 --> 34:37.720
Somebody in the comments wrote, the government's recommended amount is nine farts per day,

34:37.720 --> 34:45.280
and that doesn't include any long ones that continued over from the prior day, which is,

34:45.280 --> 34:49.360
let it be known, the first funny thing that I've ever seen on Yahoo Answers.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.560
First intentionally funny thing I've ever seen.

34:52.560 --> 34:59.760
Their source was www.fart.gov, which I did click to investigate, and it's nothing.

34:59.760 --> 35:05.960
It's not a real website, so they got me pretty good there.

35:05.960 --> 35:12.080
I do wish that whenever you clicked that hyperlink, though, it took you to a website that wrote

35:12.080 --> 35:18.560
down the names of the people that had tried to access the website.

35:18.560 --> 35:22.880
Or if it was like that cave with the genie in it, and you go into the cave and the genie

35:22.880 --> 35:25.120
leaves, and he's like, I got you.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.520
Only one person has to stay in the cave at all times, and you're here until the next

35:28.520 --> 35:29.520
person comes in.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.520
So you have to trick the next person.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.120
It's like the ring.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.120
Is that a thing?

35:34.120 --> 35:35.120
The ring?

35:35.120 --> 35:36.120
That's how the ring is.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.120
Yeah.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.120
Okay.

35:38.120 --> 35:39.120
So fart.gov.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.120
Someone please set me free.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.120
Please go to fart.gov.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.120
Please.

35:42.120 --> 35:43.120
I need it.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.920
And then sign the petition to turn that into a cabinet post.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.920
Can we register fart.gov?

35:46.920 --> 35:48.760
You have to be in the gov.

35:48.760 --> 35:54.360
I'm sure that by saying it, that it's already happened somewhere.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.360
Let me check again.

35:55.360 --> 35:56.360
Okay.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.360
Nope.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.360
Still 404-ed.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.360
Zero.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.360
Guess what?

36:00.360 --> 36:06.360
If you fart, you're a fucking freak, you're nasty.

36:06.360 --> 36:09.240
Nobody should do that.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.240
That's sin.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.240
That's sin.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.240
That's sin slipping out.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.680
It's that sin that you made.

36:15.680 --> 36:20.040
That's why it smells that way, because the brimstone from hell.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.560
So Griffin, your number is zero.

36:21.560 --> 36:26.440
Zero farts per day is the normal amount.

36:26.440 --> 36:33.020
I think that if you have four, then you're probably okay.

36:33.020 --> 36:37.440
I think if you have five, then you probably are epileptic.

36:37.440 --> 36:41.760
I think what's important is not- Wait.

36:41.760 --> 36:47.420
I think if you have six, then you have some form of hepatitis.

36:47.420 --> 36:51.160
This is a new sort of medicine.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.160
It's a new medicine.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.440
It's like criniology.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.880
I don't need to cut your hand open to see if you have carpal tunnel syndrome.

36:57.880 --> 37:02.360
I just need to know if you fart 11 times a day, because that's your body trying to tell

37:02.360 --> 37:06.240
me on this- That you're pregnant.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.240
Yeah.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.040
You have carpal tunnel and also you're pregnant.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.040
Congratulations.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.200
If you fart 11 times, you have carpal tunnel.

37:12.200 --> 37:15.480
You fart 12 times, then you have lupus.

37:15.480 --> 37:20.840
If you fart 13 times, then someone in Asia loves you very, very much.

37:20.840 --> 37:25.720
If you fart 14 times, you're going to live in a mansion.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.440
If you fart 15 times, you're going to live in a shack.

37:28.440 --> 37:31.520
You're going to marry Bobby Schmidt.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.760
This is the way you tell it.

37:32.760 --> 37:36.680
This is how you tell your future from now on.

37:36.680 --> 37:41.800
I think with all this, I think this is a new field that should be registered at fart.gov.

37:41.800 --> 37:42.800
Yeah.

37:42.800 --> 37:43.800
A list.

37:43.800 --> 37:44.800
16 times?

37:44.800 --> 37:45.800
That's a bad omen.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.200
That's a bad moon rising.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.240
Bad fart.

37:49.240 --> 37:54.680
But 17 times is a good omen, so if you get to 16 and it's like 11.45 PM, start pushing.

37:54.680 --> 37:58.480
Nobody- And the bad omen may end up that you pooped

37:58.480 --> 37:59.480
your pants.

37:59.480 --> 38:05.080
Maybe what the bad omen was trying to tell you.

38:05.080 --> 38:10.040
By the way, thanks again, the AV Club, for putting us in the podcast roundup, and thanks

38:10.040 --> 38:12.860
for your subtle commentary about how many fart jokes we have.

38:12.860 --> 38:17.400
We turned it around to a big come at me, bro, of fart jokes, apparently.

38:17.400 --> 38:24.240
I'm sorry we didn't take your advice more seriously.

38:24.240 --> 38:27.960
There's no diagnosis for 18 farts, because nobody on the planet has ever farted 18 times

38:27.960 --> 38:29.720
in one day before.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.640
They just skip right over to 19.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.720
That's why Adele called her album that, because she was so proud.

38:35.720 --> 38:36.720
She called it 18 farts?

38:36.720 --> 38:37.720
She called it 19.

38:37.720 --> 38:42.960
Her album was called 19 because of the farts.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.760
I'm not sure about that.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.200
I read about that in Crag.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.480
I'm not sure if it's accurate.

38:48.480 --> 38:53.320
The Starbucks cashier who sold me the album explained that to me, about the farts.

38:53.320 --> 38:54.320
The thing about the farts.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.400
Yeah, this album's named after how many farts she did.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.920
She did this many farts this year.

38:59.920 --> 39:00.920
In one day.

39:00.920 --> 39:01.920
She might have been a goof enough.

39:01.920 --> 39:11.800
It was way, way, way more than the normal amount, according to the government.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.760
That song about chasing pavements is about farts.

39:14.760 --> 39:15.760
Think about it.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.200
We're getting fired of the rain.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.200
Get it?

39:18.200 --> 39:19.200
Think about it.

39:19.200 --> 39:24.600
Hey, I'm a straight, red-blooded American male who, in May, is serving as best man at

39:24.600 --> 39:26.960
my gay best friend's wedding.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.880
Ceremony itself is very traditional, but I'm stumped when it comes to the bachelor

39:29.880 --> 39:30.880
party.

39:30.880 --> 39:35.140
The attendee mix is going to be about 50-50 straight gay with a few lesbians thrown in

39:35.140 --> 39:36.680
for color.

39:36.680 --> 39:40.160
How do I throw my pal a rainbow-colored bachelor party?

39:40.160 --> 39:44.840
Please note that my friend, by his own admission, is a terrible gay, and he's expressed support

39:44.840 --> 39:49.000
on the one occasion, a desire to have an Asian lady stripper at his party getting down in

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Durham.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Wow.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Wowzers.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
I feel like the bulk of it's already planned.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
This is a lot.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Asian lady stripper.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.280
I mean, this is a real tough one.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.640
We don't get many toughies like this.

40:00.640 --> 40:05.400
Ultimately, the easy answer, which is to say the not funny answer, is you give him what

40:05.400 --> 40:08.340
he wants, and I guess an Asian lady stripper.

40:08.340 --> 40:10.340
I guess that's what you do.

40:10.340 --> 40:11.340
This is my answer.

40:11.340 --> 40:12.880
The fun answer.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.760
What can't you do at a gay bachelor party?

40:15.760 --> 40:16.760
This is not a-

40:16.760 --> 40:17.760
Oh my god, you're right.

40:17.760 --> 40:22.320
There's going to be a 50-50 split with some lesbians thrown in for color.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.720
I'm imagining a Caligulin miasma of genital delights.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.200
Just a bacchanal.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.200
Just a-

40:29.200 --> 40:30.200
Yeah.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.200
What do you want?

40:31.200 --> 40:32.860
Because it's everywhere.

40:32.860 --> 40:36.420
The fucking sky's the limit as far as fucking goes.

40:36.420 --> 40:37.680
Earthly delights.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.680
Put it anywhere.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.680
Happy bachelor party.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.840
Sorry, Dave couldn't marry you.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.040
He died last night.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.160
He OD'd on hedonism.

40:49.160 --> 40:54.640
Now he's a weird sexaholic, and he can only love a gay dead midget's watcher.

40:54.640 --> 41:03.160
He was drinking wine out of a lady's hair, and he goes crazy.

41:03.160 --> 41:07.680
He set a pet rock on fire and jerted up a guy named Dave's anus, and now that's the

41:07.680 --> 41:08.680
only way he can finish.

41:08.680 --> 41:13.240
He cut himself on all the harps.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.240
Lacerated himself.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.080
Oh, man.

41:17.080 --> 41:20.240
You know, he-

41:20.240 --> 41:24.640
I think if you get the right Asian lady stripper, then everybody will enjoy it, because you

41:24.640 --> 41:30.840
gotta have one that's high on theater, and is just fun.

41:30.840 --> 41:36.640
You know, like not as much focused on the seduction as they are on the pageantry.

41:36.640 --> 41:41.680
If you get that kind of Asian lady stripper, and maybe a little whimsy, maybe some whimsy

41:41.680 --> 41:44.540
thrown in.

41:44.540 --> 41:48.920
You could just go the traditional route, and just rent out a cabin by a lake, and just

41:48.920 --> 41:53.600
go there with all of his friends with a few beers, and have a classy time, and then everyone

41:53.600 --> 41:59.480
just pops a bunch of ecstasy, and then pees on a beached whale.

41:59.480 --> 42:00.800
See where it goes.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.080
Just see what happens.

42:03.080 --> 42:06.800
I feel like we're- I think this is gonna be a pretty good party, or the last party,

42:06.800 --> 42:09.120
either which way you've done your job.

42:09.120 --> 42:12.120
We all got butthole tattoos!

42:12.120 --> 42:13.120
And also, he's in prison.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.120
Sorry.

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
Sorry.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.120
Sorry.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
Hangover three.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.280
It's okay, though, because this butthole tattoo looks like a shark, so no one's gonna get

42:19.280 --> 42:20.280
near him.

42:20.280 --> 42:26.480
Are we done?

42:26.480 --> 42:27.480
Maybe a cake?

42:27.480 --> 42:28.480
I don't know.

42:28.480 --> 42:31.760
Maybe a tasteful cake?

42:31.760 --> 42:32.760
Some balloons?

42:32.760 --> 42:33.760
Hey!

42:33.760 --> 42:34.760
Welcome to Cake Boss!

42:34.760 --> 42:40.400
This week on Cake Boss, we're making a big cake shaped like a butthole for a gay guy's

42:40.400 --> 42:44.080
bachelor party with an Asian lady stripper gonna pop out of it!

42:44.080 --> 42:45.840
We're making a cake- I hope you're just thinking about it.

42:45.840 --> 42:49.400
This cake looks like a dick going into a cake shaped like a vagina going into a cake shaped

42:49.400 --> 42:50.400
like another vagina!

42:50.400 --> 42:51.400
Cake Boss!

42:51.400 --> 42:52.400
Cake Boss!

42:52.400 --> 42:58.320
Stay tuned for the littlest chocolatiers, by which I mean they're inside the cake!

42:58.320 --> 42:59.320
What the fuck?

42:59.320 --> 43:00.320
What the fuck?

43:00.320 --> 43:03.000
I'm making eight dicks today!

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Cake Boss!

43:04.000 --> 43:08.320
This isn't even for a party!

43:08.320 --> 43:11.560
This isn't even being filmed right now!

43:11.560 --> 43:13.440
This butthole cake's for Cake Boss!

43:13.440 --> 43:14.440
Cake Boss!

43:14.440 --> 43:15.440
This cake's for-

43:15.440 --> 43:16.440
What the fuck?

43:16.440 --> 43:17.440
What the fuck?

43:17.440 --> 43:18.440
What the fuck?

43:18.440 --> 43:19.440
What the fuck?

43:19.440 --> 43:20.440
What the fuck?

43:20.440 --> 43:21.440
What the fuck?

43:21.440 --> 43:22.440
What the fuck?

43:22.440 --> 43:23.440
What the fuck?

43:23.440 --> 43:40.120
This cake's for- Fucking Cake Boss!

43:40.120 --> 43:47.280
This cake's made of sand and also I'm a ghost!

43:47.280 --> 43:48.280
Cake Boss!

43:48.280 --> 43:49.280
Cake Boss!

43:49.280 --> 43:50.280
Cake Ghost!

43:50.280 --> 43:53.000
Oh Christ!

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Cake Boss!

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Oh!

43:55.000 --> 43:58.240
I mean you gotta earn the title somehow!

43:58.240 --> 43:59.240
You gotta dethrone-

43:59.240 --> 44:01.440
So I guess I'm a Cake Boss themed bachelor party.

44:01.440 --> 44:08.200
I guess in closing, that's the only way you can dethrone him, you gotta up his game!

44:08.200 --> 44:09.200
Gotta beat him in his own game!

44:09.200 --> 44:11.240
You gotta out Cake Boss the Cake Boss!

44:11.240 --> 44:12.240
Out Cake Boss the Cake-

44:12.240 --> 44:13.800
What was the question?

44:13.800 --> 44:19.940
Hey, so thanks for listening to our stupid show, my brother, my brother and me.

44:19.940 --> 44:23.900
We really appreciate you sticking with us through thick and thin.

44:23.900 --> 44:27.200
That is assuming that you didn't turn it off like ten minutes ago when we were talking

44:27.200 --> 44:28.200
about farts.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.740
Not that anybody could blame you.

44:29.740 --> 44:35.820
You gotta make it through the swamp of farts to get to those good, good Cake Boss goops.

44:35.820 --> 44:42.940
Thank you to everybody who tweeted about the show this week with the NBNBM hashtag.

44:42.940 --> 44:51.720
Thank you to Good Writer, that's with a R-I-G-H-T-E-R, thanks to Crystal Whalen for tweeting about

44:51.720 --> 44:58.020
the show, The Jake of Ink, thanks to Botherer, make sure you check out his show, Rumdoings

44:58.020 --> 45:01.460
or his site Rock, Paper, Shotgun.

45:01.460 --> 45:04.680
He's always been super supportive of us and we certainly appreciate it.

45:04.680 --> 45:12.760
Jinxville, The Triscuit, our buddy, Tristan the Marine, Mason Your Face, everybody.

45:12.760 --> 45:20.180
If I may, I would like to ask you, our listeners, our friends, for a favor.

45:20.180 --> 45:24.940
The theater that I work for is competing in a contest to win us a new set of lights, which

45:24.940 --> 45:29.060
we desperately need, and so we would really appreciate your support.

45:29.060 --> 45:33.820
I'm gonna put a link on Twitter after the show goes up, and there's also gonna be a

45:33.820 --> 45:41.980
link on the MaximumFun.org webpage, and probably also on Facebook too, so if you could go and

45:41.980 --> 45:43.540
vote for our lighting video.

45:43.540 --> 45:47.320
It's also a really funny video, and I'd really appreciate it.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.320
I wanna thank-

45:48.320 --> 45:49.320
Well then we're-

45:49.320 --> 45:50.320
So, sorry, go ahead.

45:50.320 --> 45:51.320
No, let's all do that.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.820
I was just gonna say everybody do that.

45:52.820 --> 45:53.820
Everybody do that.

45:53.820 --> 45:54.820
You have my permission.

45:54.820 --> 45:59.060
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Longwinners for the use of the theme song to our podcast,

45:59.060 --> 46:02.280
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

46:02.280 --> 46:06.940
It's so fucking good, and you should buy the album, and then all their albums.

46:06.940 --> 46:09.860
Yeah, someone else just bought it.

46:09.860 --> 46:11.940
And again, just now.

46:11.940 --> 46:14.460
People are buying it all the time.

46:14.460 --> 46:15.460
That one was John Roderick.

46:15.460 --> 46:16.460
He bought it himself.

46:16.460 --> 46:17.460
Oh, no, there's another guy.

46:17.460 --> 46:18.460
Okay.

46:18.460 --> 46:19.460
Named also John Roderick.

46:19.460 --> 46:20.460
You wanna close it?

46:20.460 --> 46:21.460
Yeah.

46:21.460 --> 46:26.740
Do you get our email address?

46:26.740 --> 46:33.500
It's nbnbm at MaximumFun.org, and also check out Bullseye, it used to be called The Sound

46:33.500 --> 46:34.500
of Young America.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.500
We're on it sometimes.

46:35.500 --> 46:39.700
It's also at MaximumFun.org, and PRI, and a bunch of other places.

46:39.700 --> 46:43.940
Oh, and start podcasting yourself, just hit their 200th episode, so make sure you check

46:43.940 --> 46:44.940
that if you haven't already.

46:44.940 --> 46:45.940
Yeah, congratulations to those guys.

46:45.940 --> 46:46.940
We're approaching our 100th, aren't we?

46:46.940 --> 46:47.940
Yeah.

46:47.940 --> 46:48.940
Yeah, we're...

46:48.940 --> 46:49.940
And then we'll stop forever.

46:49.940 --> 46:50.940
Bye, everyone.

46:50.940 --> 46:51.940
That was a good one.

46:51.940 --> 46:57.940
This final Yahoo was sent in by Keenan Williams also.

46:57.940 --> 47:01.220
Quickly becoming a gold status contributor.

47:01.220 --> 47:08.220
It's by Yahoo answers user Amanda, who asks, did Kel from Keenan and Kel die?

47:08.220 --> 47:11.460
I'm Justin McElroy.

47:11.460 --> 47:12.460
I'm Travis McElroy.

47:12.460 --> 47:13.460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

47:13.460 --> 47:16.460
This has been my brother, my brother and me, kiss your dad.

47:16.460 --> 47:17.460
Just go wear the lips.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.460
Keep your heart, three stacks.

47:18.460 --> 47:19.460
Keep your heart.

47:19.460 --> 47:20.460
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

47:20.460 --> 47:21.460
Keep your heart.

47:21.460 --> 47:22.460
Man, these girls are smart.

47:22.460 --> 47:23.460
Three stacks, these girls are smart.

47:23.460 --> 47:38.620
Play your part.
