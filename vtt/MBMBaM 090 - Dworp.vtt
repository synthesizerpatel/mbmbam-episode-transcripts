00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.520
Hey, what's up? It's time for the Super Bowl. No, no, no, no. What? You gotta say big game.

00:50.400 --> 00:59.360
Why? Because if you say S-U-P-E-R bowl, then we'll get sued. Says who? The government.

00:59.360 --> 01:04.240
The government. You're making that up. Obama. Obama said so. I know. Obama is the football

01:04.240 --> 01:09.440
commish, and he said that you're not allowed to say those words. If I understood the rules correctly,

01:10.240 --> 01:17.440
I could say Super Bowl, but I could not say Super Base. There are three people in the world right

01:17.440 --> 01:23.680
now who can say Super B. You aren't one of them, but Boomer, the sports commentator, is one,

01:23.680 --> 01:34.880
and also Dan Marino, and also everybody who's playing in the Super Bowl. Do you guys get excited

01:34.880 --> 01:42.720
for the big game? I'm excited for the Puppy Bowl. You know, I only watch it for the commercials.

01:45.040 --> 01:51.920
Sometimes I think that commercials are better than the game. Justin, you actually can't refer

01:51.920 --> 02:00.560
to the commercials that air during the Super B. You have to call them TV breaks. TV breaks? Or

02:01.360 --> 02:11.680
very expensive advertisements. My favorite TV break ever is when that lady has the hammer,

02:11.680 --> 02:17.600
and she swings around, and then she throws it through the TV screen. You know the one

02:17.600 --> 02:27.840
from 1984? A lot of people don't know that she poops herself. But it's unrelated. I think it

02:27.840 --> 02:36.480
was during Big Game 38. It was the very expensive advertisement where the overweight woman who

02:36.480 --> 02:41.600
married Tom Arnold got hit by a log. Do you remember that? Griffin, you actually can't say

02:41.600 --> 02:51.440
Tom Arnold? Okay, the overweight woman who married the main protagonist from the movie The Stupids.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.760
Exactly. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think my favorite is that one. Have you seen that one?

02:55.760 --> 03:01.520
And it's got the animal in it, and he talks, but he says something really funny. And I think it's

03:02.560 --> 03:09.920
either about beer or chips. I like the one for beer chips with Spuds McKenzie. You actually can't

03:09.920 --> 03:14.640
say Spuds McKenzie. I cannot say Spuds McKenzie. You can say Potatoes McGee and we'll know.

03:15.200 --> 03:22.080
Okay. Potatoes McGee, the dog-shaped spokesperson. Thank you. Is that legal? Is that okay? Barely.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.080
Barely legal. Speaking of things that are barely okay, this is my brother and brother and me,

03:27.040 --> 03:31.600
an advice show. For the modern era, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your

03:31.600 --> 03:34.880
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby brother, Kit Dan Marino.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.960
Kit Kenneth Dan-nith Marino. Kay Dan Marino.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.640
Kay Dan Marino Jr. What does Kay stand for? Not to be confused with the football guy.

03:45.680 --> 03:54.320
Kick. Kick. Kick. Catch with a K. Since we obviously aren't fit to offer any sort of

03:54.320 --> 04:03.120
advice on sport or sporting, let's go to the advice. I'm graduating college this semester,

04:03.120 --> 04:08.640
and then I'm up and moving to San Fran, probably not for good. No, I'm sorry. Probably for good.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.800
The thing is, I've been dating a wonderful girl here in North Carolina for the past three months

04:12.800 --> 04:18.320
or so. She's amazing, but we're not about to do the long-distance thing across three time zones,

04:18.320 --> 04:23.600
so we're trying to cut it off. The question is, when is the right time for us to stop dating?

04:23.600 --> 04:28.800
Right now, we're trying to gradually transition it into a sexy friendship with pretty good results.

04:28.800 --> 04:35.840
Help us, brothers. That's from nearly departed in North Carolina. Oh my god. I think you should do

04:35.840 --> 04:40.880
it at the last second. As your car is driving away, lean your head out the window and be like,

04:40.880 --> 04:46.480
oh, by the way, we're breaking up. Goodbye. Does she know, right? She knows. She has to know.

04:47.360 --> 04:51.600
That doesn't matter, though, because you're actually up and moving to the fucking danger zone.

04:51.600 --> 04:59.840
Yeah. You're in deep, deep trouble. Why? We're trying to transition

04:59.840 --> 05:04.160
our love into a sexy friendship. Yeah, that's going to work out pretty well, probably.

05:04.160 --> 05:12.160
Yeah. Have you not seen any movie with Jennifer Aniston in it, ever? That's all they're about,

05:12.160 --> 05:16.400
is how impossible this is, this movie we're trying to do. Did you not see Friends with Benefits or

05:16.400 --> 05:24.800
what was that other one? Friendster with Benefits. Buddies. Social Network. Buddies with Perks.

05:24.800 --> 05:33.360
Buddy Bollin. Buddy Bollin. Bone and Buddies. Bone and Buddies or Fuck Pal or Air Buddies.

05:33.360 --> 05:40.640
Air Buddies or Treasure Buddies. Or Pleasure Buddies. Or MVP for Most Valuable Fuck Buddy.

05:40.640 --> 05:51.280
Let's start with a P. Let's start with a P. P-H-U-C-K. Yesterday is the proper time.

05:51.280 --> 05:58.960
Is it possible that this dude has found the perfect combination of words to actually make

05:58.960 --> 06:05.120
that transition? I know that we all doubt that he said, hey, honey, this is going great, but I'm

06:05.120 --> 06:10.960
moving, let's just be sexy friends. But is it possible? Well, they're gradually trans- they

06:10.960 --> 06:16.400
are gearing, they're shifting their gears down, right? So it's a sexy friendship now. Next week

06:16.400 --> 06:20.000
it'll be regular friendship, the week after that it'll be sort of an acrimonious friendship,

06:20.000 --> 06:26.400
and the week after that it'll be like bitter rivals. Right. Arch-nemesis. Arch-nemesis,

06:26.400 --> 06:31.520
and then you bounce. And then you're out with that, that you're someone who wants you to die

06:31.520 --> 06:37.120
in North Carolina somewhere. They're plotting your death. Which, hey, actually with the trajectory

06:37.120 --> 06:43.440
you're on, that may not be too far off of a goof. Yeah. Yeah, it may end up just like that.

06:44.640 --> 06:52.080
I mean, I think you need to decide what you want. If you guys just want to continue

06:52.080 --> 06:57.440
fooling around, but once you move it never be anything else, you're on the right track. If

06:57.440 --> 07:03.760
you want to preserve the friendship, I think you have to stop with the sexual stuff ASAP,

07:03.760 --> 07:09.680
and start to create some sort of friendship outside of that. Otherwise, the only connection

07:09.680 --> 07:13.040
you're going to have is physical, and as soon as you go to San Francisco, that's done.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.400
You also want to think about the fact that you're, as you said, moving three time zones away,

07:18.400 --> 07:23.920
so maybe you want to make sure you have some free and clear time, like a month or two before you

07:23.920 --> 07:29.360
leave to kind of say goodbye to everyone, and just have some quality time with all your friends and

07:29.360 --> 07:35.200
everything without worrying about this friendship, relationship, sticky morass you've gotten

07:35.200 --> 07:44.800
yourself into. So vital. Yeah, maybe try sticking morass. Oh, Justin. What? It was just as Travis

07:44.800 --> 07:50.640
said it, I was just saying it a different way. Is it riffing? Is it riffing? Just three bros

07:50.640 --> 07:55.440
getting yucked at. Now you're fucked. But hey, here's the good news. If you manage to actually

07:55.440 --> 08:00.080
pull this off, then you should have an advice podcast that we listen to. Call, I'm a warlock.

08:00.080 --> 08:08.080
Yeah, wizard time. I'm a sex wizard. Sex wizard with your friend in North Carolina, Guy. Guy,

08:08.080 --> 08:17.600
sex wizard, Guy. So congratulations on that. Griffin. Here's a very timely yahoo that has to

08:17.600 --> 08:24.640
do with both football and wizardry. It's sent in by Elisa Holifield. It's asked by yahoo user

08:24.640 --> 08:32.800
forever Rogers fan, who asks, who would win, Aaron Rodgers or Harry Potter? I know this is really

08:32.800 --> 08:37.280
random and hard to compare, but who would win? There's no specific competition, but you should

08:37.280 --> 08:43.520
assume they are not playing a football game or having a magical duel, although Aaron could use

08:43.520 --> 08:50.000
football skills and Harry could use magical skills. Also, who wins when it comes to moral character?

08:50.000 --> 08:56.720
My friend and I literally debated this for 1.5 and a half more, more than one and a half hours.

08:56.720 --> 09:02.240
So this is very important. Yeah, it's serious. Just some background for you too. Aaron Rodgers

09:02.240 --> 09:09.120
is the quarterback of the Green Bay Packers. This morning was named the NFL MVP for the year.

09:09.120 --> 09:15.360
Oh, so that must mean that the Packers are in the big game. It is. It's actually the Packers

09:15.360 --> 09:21.840
v. Packers. They were so good that they put him right in there twice. Can you, isn't that objectively

09:21.840 --> 09:27.840
untrue though? Like if they had the most value, what are they using to measure value? Here's the

09:27.840 --> 09:32.720
great thing is that their offense is so good, but their defense is the worst in the league. So he is

09:32.720 --> 09:38.080
the most valuable. If it weren't for him, we would have like a real major league scenario. I guess

09:38.080 --> 09:43.360
sinkhole would just open up and swallow them all. Basically, yeah. He's the only thing keeping them

09:43.360 --> 09:51.440
from sinkhole status. Imagine like a bunch of poop, but the poop is held together by glue.

09:52.880 --> 09:58.800
So you're saying Aaron Rodgers is the poop glue. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The most valuable

09:58.800 --> 10:06.720
poop glue. In their failed playoff game, he got the most rushing yards of anybody on the field,

10:06.720 --> 10:11.600
which usually quarterbacks don't do. That's not very good. He also got all the tackles.

10:13.200 --> 10:22.560
And he sold hot dogs. So who'd win, guys? So wait, so the question is not Harry Potter

10:22.560 --> 10:29.760
versus Aaron Rodgers, but not in any competition. Yeah. So they're not actually competing. Well,

10:29.760 --> 10:34.800
okay. Or you could look at it like in all competitions. Right. Like what if there was

10:34.800 --> 10:40.480
a magical duel? I would say probably Aaron Rodgers, because the only way that you can

10:40.480 --> 10:47.920
throw that good is with wizarding abilities. Right. I saw him once throw a football through a man.

10:50.880 --> 10:57.440
I saw him battle a dragon with a football. Yeah. So I would say that match Rodgers.

10:57.440 --> 11:02.720
If it's a cooking competition, Harry Potter. Why? Because his cupcakes are magical. Okay.

11:02.720 --> 11:10.560
Okay. Have you sampled his cupcakes? Yeah. It's in Travis's fanfic. Yeah. In his cupcake

11:10.560 --> 11:20.320
fic. It's a Draco slash Harry slash Ron slash buttercream. Is this buttercream made from

11:20.320 --> 11:31.120
butterbeer? Scandalous! Harry, I've become tipped in tipsund. I've actually rewritten

11:31.120 --> 11:36.640
all of the Harry Potter series, removed all of the female characters and turned them all into

11:36.640 --> 11:44.560
18th century fops. Okay. You're gonna say you turned them all into cupcakes. Basically,

11:44.560 --> 11:49.520
it's just about cupcakes. The cupcakes aren't alive and don't move or anything. It's just

11:49.520 --> 11:56.000
about them like sitting on a shelf. Yeah. Getting magical. It's not very good. I think Aaron Rodgers

11:56.000 --> 12:04.720
would probably, like overall, does it being real give you an advantage? Like being an actual thing

12:04.720 --> 12:09.680
that exists as opposed to Harry Potter? What are you talking about? Did you not see the Harry Potter

12:09.680 --> 12:14.240
movies? Like how could they, how could they film him? Like I saw him, you know? I saw him. I saw

12:14.240 --> 12:20.240
him do magic. I saw him and I saw him do magic. You know, people said actually, I saw this on the

12:20.240 --> 12:27.600
back of a bazooka joke, bazooka wrapper, Harry Potter is the most successful documentary ever

12:27.600 --> 12:34.640
released in the world. A lot of people said you can't release an eight-part documentary, each of

12:34.640 --> 12:42.720
which is three hours, not since the Seven Up series. Has anyone attempted such a feat following,

12:42.720 --> 12:46.720
you know, young people throughout their years? But I'm actually surprised that they were able

12:46.720 --> 12:52.240
to get David Attenborough to narrate it. Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Is he, so he was the guy

12:52.240 --> 12:57.920
with the beard. I was wondering where he fit in and why he was there. Well, he wore the beard as a

12:57.920 --> 13:03.280
disguise because as a documentarian, you don't want to like influence your subjects, but also

13:03.280 --> 13:09.760
he fucking loves jelly beans. Yeah, some real gorillas in the mission. I'm into that sort of

13:09.760 --> 13:18.880
gorilla style filmmaking. What if they played football? Oh, okay. Like on broomsticks? Or no

13:18.880 --> 13:25.200
brooms. I don't, that's like saying, okay, Harry Potter, you don't get to use a broom, but Aaron

13:25.200 --> 13:30.160
Rogers, you don't get to use your legs. I don't think we should, don't, let's not limit these

13:30.160 --> 13:35.440
people. So Harry Potter's on a broomstick. Aaron Rogers is on his legs. If we're just Aaron Rogers.

13:35.440 --> 13:40.400
First of all, there is no such thing as like one-on-one street football. Like, no, it's me.

13:42.080 --> 13:47.360
That's like, I have a ghost, I have a ghost wide receiver and he definitely caught that.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.480
I gotta be honest with you, from the way you're describing the Green Bay Packards,

13:50.480 --> 14:00.480
it doesn't sound that far off. Man, was that a sports joke? It was a good sports joke. I need

14:00.480 --> 14:06.080
to go lie down. I've got the papers. I pulled something in my brain. Pulled a chuckle muscle.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.760
Harry Potter could just use magic to kill Aaron Rogers, is what I'm afraid of.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.920
Aaron Rogers could just use football to kill Harry Potter. But he wouldn't. Like,

14:15.920 --> 14:21.760
what you're saying is, like, he wouldn't use, uh, uh, one of the forbidden curses? No,

14:21.760 --> 14:27.280
you just use a gun. Well, Aaron Rogers could use a gun too, Travis. Don't be an asshole.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.960
No, but I'm just saying, like, I think Harry Potter would kill Aaron Rogers before Aaron

14:30.960 --> 14:36.960
Rogers would kill Harry Potter. I agree a hundred percent. You think Harry Potter would kill Aaron

14:36.960 --> 14:42.960
Rogers with a gun? Have you ever seen, have you ever seen, like, an interview with Aaron Rogers?

14:42.960 --> 14:48.640
Like, he's the sweetest guy. And Harry Potter's just a right asshole. Yeah. He's a murderous,

14:48.640 --> 14:53.280
bloodthirsty asshole. Let's go, let's go down the list. How many people has Harry Potter killed?

14:53.280 --> 14:58.960
At least one. The Dark Lord. Spoilers. How many people has Aaron Rogers killed? None. Zero people.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.880
He killed my dreams. Harry Potter has killed a hundred percent more people than Aaron Rogers,

15:03.440 --> 15:10.640
as far as we know. Yeah. Okay, fine. Yes. I would like to amend this question and make it Aaron

15:10.640 --> 15:16.400
Rogers or Harry Potter, who would win in a gentleman's duel at dawn? So with what? Magic?

15:16.400 --> 15:21.920
Aaron Rogers has no magic. Harry Potter gets to use his magic. Aaron Rogers throws a football.

15:21.920 --> 15:30.320
Count to ten. Walk. Turn. Throw. Avada Kedavra. Both die. What a tragedy. What a tragedy.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.960
Senseless tragedy this was. I bet. Thanks a lot, my brother, my brother, and me. Do we have one

15:36.960 --> 15:42.320
listener out there who is not a very big nerd and also is not a very big jock and they're just like,

15:42.320 --> 15:52.560
who the fuck are- what the fuck are you talking- What is going on? I'm having an aneurysm. Hey. Hey.

15:53.440 --> 16:00.400
Yeah? I got another question. Okay. Are you ready for it? Yeah. Griffin, what about you? Yes, of

16:00.400 --> 16:07.600
course, go. Jesus. Let's do it. Next week, I have to be at home while a security company installs an

16:07.600 --> 16:11.840
alarm system in my house. I was told this could take up to three hours. These house calls are

16:11.840 --> 16:16.960
always awkward because I never know what to do. Should I sequester myself in another room and let

16:16.960 --> 16:22.800
the security dudes work in peace? Should I make small talk? Help me, McElroy. That's from unsure

16:22.800 --> 16:29.600
and newly secure. No, don't make small talk. No. This is something- as somebody who works out of

16:29.600 --> 16:36.080
my home, this is something I've had to deal with on occasion. My general strategy is to pretend I'm

16:36.080 --> 16:41.920
an architect, like Mike Brady, and I'm working upstairs. I'll say, I'm just finishing up some

16:41.920 --> 16:46.560
stuff upstairs, so if you guys need me, just yell, and then I hide. Do you know what I almost always

16:46.560 --> 16:56.160
do, almost like reflexively, is I do chores. Like, I'm working too. Like, I'll do some dishes. I'll

16:56.160 --> 17:01.920
be like, oh, tell me about it, guys. Woo, backfucking stuff. Right? Every 10 minutes, I just come in

17:01.920 --> 17:06.880
with a tray of lemonade and brownies. I'm like, you guys sure you don't want any of these brownies?

17:06.880 --> 17:12.160
Wearing an apron and only an apron. You know, I actually, when I worked at Best Buy,

17:12.160 --> 17:17.360
I went out on a couple of installs with our installer and went into people's houses and

17:17.360 --> 17:23.760
installed sound systems and home theater stuff. It is the worst thing when the person won't leave

17:23.760 --> 17:30.480
the room for two reasons. One, it feels like they're judging every single thing that you do,

17:30.480 --> 17:39.280
and they're like, oh, you're going to put a wire there, huh? Okay. But also, they're just there,

17:39.280 --> 17:44.080
because even if they make small talk, after like three minutes, the small talk ends and they're

17:44.080 --> 17:49.600
still just hovering in the room like a ghost. Yeah. You know, it's funny, Trev. The last time

17:49.600 --> 17:57.840
this happened to me was Best Buy installers hanging a TV for me, and one of them actually made a

17:57.840 --> 18:03.840
comment. They had to have me come down a couple of times to answer questions, and one guy actually

18:03.840 --> 18:10.080
said, I noticed you keep running upstairs. What's going on? Do you want me to chill?

18:10.080 --> 18:15.600
Why don't you call G-Nos? It's order is on. Just get to know each other. Let's just bro out,

18:15.600 --> 18:20.000
you know? Let's get a pub, which we just hung. I know you got a baller TV. I just hung it.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.880
He taps you on the forehead and says, let me get in there, and then he taps you on the heart and

18:24.880 --> 18:28.640
then he taps you on the heart and says, and then here. Then let me get in there. Let's just eat

18:28.640 --> 18:34.320
some za and watch some tapes. Let me just test this TV out real quick all day. Let's take it

18:34.320 --> 18:41.200
for a spin. Let's take it for a watch. You may, finally. When someone comes in your home to do

18:41.200 --> 18:46.560
a thing to it, that home is theirs until they leave. That's all right. It's the law of the

18:46.560 --> 18:51.280
land. You might as well just go, because they live there for a bit. You guys are going to live

18:51.280 --> 18:57.200
here for a tip and I'll just chill. I say you have like three prepared questions.

18:59.040 --> 19:08.800
Oh my God. And then, do you guys need anything? Are there any things I could point you towards?

19:08.800 --> 19:13.040
And then say, well, now I will leave you to do your job because you are professionals and I am

19:13.040 --> 19:17.920
in the way. And then you stand quietly facing in the corner. Here's one that you can trot out that

19:17.920 --> 19:30.480
I use and maybe you can use. I said, what are my walls made of? I'm imagining you talking to a

19:30.480 --> 19:35.600
best buyman with like a bunch of index cards in your hands just like flipping through. I'm like,

19:35.600 --> 19:44.560
hey, your shirt is very dirty. Why is that? So do I have a good house? Can I look at your hands?

19:44.560 --> 19:49.280
I've been told the hands of a workman are a second home. What's it like to be a member of

19:49.280 --> 19:54.960
the working class? I knew you guys were supposed to have blue collars. I didn't know your whole

19:54.960 --> 20:02.320
shirt would be blue. Please explain. What is your tax rate? Interesting. Did you feel ostracized

20:02.320 --> 20:09.280
when you went to technical high school? I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. It's

20:09.280 --> 20:13.520
not that this is what's so terrible, but I'm like, this is the same thing. Like when I go to the

20:13.520 --> 20:22.880
mechanic or whatever, it's not that I look down on people who have a trade. It's that I'm so

20:22.880 --> 20:30.880
embarrassed. Yeah, you look up. What I do, people who can make things and hang things and know what

20:30.880 --> 20:37.280
my walls are made of. It's so far from anything I have any concept of. I desperately want to know

20:37.280 --> 20:44.800
those. I would love to be in that part of that world, but my brain doesn't. I don't know. I don't

20:44.800 --> 20:50.880
remember what my walls are made of. I've already forgot. What I find is that I feel the same way,

20:50.880 --> 20:57.840
and it's usually because in any other situation, I wouldn't hesitate to expound on my own opinions

20:57.840 --> 21:03.200
and be like, oh yeah, that is good pizza, and it's got this. But when I go to a mechanic and

21:03.200 --> 21:08.080
he starts telling me shit is wrong with my car, I just go, yeah, that's probably true. Just take

21:08.080 --> 21:13.680
me. I completely agree with you because I'm an idiot. Whenever you pay for any kind of skilled

21:13.680 --> 21:19.200
labor, you're basically saying, I can't do this. Please do this for me, and I'll give you money

21:19.200 --> 21:24.080
for doing it for me. I don't know. You might as well be crying every time you ask anyone to do

21:24.080 --> 21:28.480
something for you along the lines of skilled labor. But you know what else is important? I

21:28.480 --> 21:35.840
don't try to improve on that, though. I'm not trying to learn the skill. I'm such a fucking

21:35.840 --> 21:42.080
phony. You know what I'll throw out sometimes? Yeah, I just don't have the time. I'd love to

21:42.080 --> 21:46.560
get in there and just fucking rip that oil filter out and put in a new one. What are you doing?

21:46.560 --> 21:51.280
Oh, you're doing some soldering, huh? Yeah, I could. Yeah, just who's got the time to solder?

21:51.280 --> 21:56.960
Gotta go to the depot, buy the solder juice. I'm out of solder, so if you guys could solder

21:56.960 --> 22:03.120
those things shut or on or whatever it is that we agreed that needed to happen. Yeah, my forge down

22:03.120 --> 22:09.680
in the basement. It's out of commish. Yeah, I was hammering away on the old anvil, pulled the

22:09.680 --> 22:15.600
hamstring, and are you guys gonna... I tell you what, if you guys are gonna smelt something later,

22:15.600 --> 22:22.320
I'll come back. He who smelt it, dealt it. Am I right, guys? I'm gonna go. Just give me a call

22:22.320 --> 22:28.400
when the smell takes over. Oh, my phone's dead. Well, catch you later. What if you did that for

22:28.400 --> 22:32.880
everything? You were at fucking Pier 1 Imports buying some plates, and you're like, yeah,

22:32.880 --> 22:39.520
I'd make my own plates, but who's got the time? My ceramics wheel is busted. I gotta dry and

22:39.520 --> 22:44.960
glaze the ceramic. Like, oh, too busy. You know, the other day, Teresa's dad tried to explain to

22:44.960 --> 22:50.960
me how to change my oil. He was like, oh, you just do it. And after like 10 minutes of him explaining

22:50.960 --> 22:58.160
it to me, I just stopped him and said, hey, Mike, I'm not gonna do it. Here's the amount of frequency

22:58.160 --> 23:04.800
that I have to do something in order for me to learn how to do it, and that thing is... I'll say

23:04.800 --> 23:09.200
four days. If I have to do something like shave every four days, if I had to shave every five

23:09.200 --> 23:14.320
days, I'd have someone else do it for me. I'd go pay to have someone do it for me. Getting your oil

23:14.320 --> 23:19.440
changed is like what, every eight months? Yeah. Every eight months, every 10,000 miles? Like,

23:19.440 --> 23:24.800
that is not a big deal. You know, every time I go get my hair cut, I ask them if they offer

23:25.840 --> 23:32.000
shaves. Every time. And the people at Supercuts are pissed. They never have like a...

23:32.880 --> 23:39.600
give you like a massage like Jesse's barber does for him. Like an electric massage. I used to get

23:39.600 --> 23:43.360
that treatment in Chicago, but I haven't found a place in Austin that can replicate it, but God

23:43.360 --> 23:49.520
damn, it makes you feel like the king of some sort of small country. My man, Sonny, will wash my hair

23:49.520 --> 23:56.400
if I tip him right. That's about it. It's a weird vibe, having a dude washing your hair. It's weirder

23:56.400 --> 24:02.400
to ask for it because you enjoy it. Sonny, can you do this for me, please? Sonny, please? I don't

24:02.400 --> 24:07.040
know how to wash my hair! Sonny, I only wash my hair every five days, so I have to get a guy.

24:07.040 --> 24:15.600
It's not a skill I've taken on. I guess that answers that question. Yeah, I guess that answers

24:15.600 --> 24:23.360
that. I'm looking for an activity that my girlfriend and I could do together. We spend a lot of time at

24:23.360 --> 24:27.440
home doing nothing, which we enjoy, but we'd like to get out more. What do you suggest?

24:27.440 --> 24:38.160
That's from Bored in Burlington. Bored in Burlington. Literally anything. Well, that's not

24:38.160 --> 24:44.960
very helpful. I know, but the question is just so broad. The world is your fucking oyster. Go shuck

24:44.960 --> 24:51.440
it. I also have no idea what you enjoy. Yeah, what do you like? Do you want to go to like a vineyard,

24:51.440 --> 25:00.400
or do you want to go like to a monster truck show? It's hard to say. Or both. Man, just go get wasted

25:00.400 --> 25:06.080
at a vineyard and then pound some brews at a monster truck rally. Or get real drunk, buy a

25:06.080 --> 25:12.320
monster truck, then drive it all over a vineyard. I don't know what people are doing these days.

25:13.520 --> 25:19.440
Here's what I like to do when I go out. Go to eat. Yeah. That's something you can try. Have you

25:19.440 --> 25:25.600
tried TGI Fridays? Have you tried the dip at TGI Fridays? That's pretty good. They've got this three

25:25.600 --> 25:31.840
for $60.99 deal. It's awesome. It's a great deal. And just incredible cheesecake there.

25:33.040 --> 25:41.040
What about, what if the two of you learn to shoot pool, and you go out to local watering holes,

25:41.040 --> 25:45.360
and you just get really good at- Hustle some bitches. Well, at first you can't hustle,

25:45.360 --> 25:50.080
because I learned this the hard way. You have to get good first. If you just say you're really bad,

25:50.080 --> 25:54.640
and then you play pool, and you lose really bad, that's not a hustle. I tried that once. That's

25:54.640 --> 26:00.240
hubris. I went out, and I saw pool hall junkies. I was like, oh, I can do that. And I went, and I

26:00.240 --> 26:05.200
lost some games. And I was like, how about we drop $400 on it? And they're like, okay. And I said,

26:05.200 --> 26:11.600
rack them. And then I lost $400. Yeah. You can't just all of a sudden start using pool lingo.

26:11.600 --> 26:16.800
That's not what a hustle is. I thought that for a while. You take off your jacket dramatically.

26:16.800 --> 26:21.600
Yeah. Take off your jacket and be like, rack them, and I'll crack them. And your shirt says,

26:21.600 --> 26:33.520
best at pool. Best at pool, 2003. That would be a double hustle. They think you're bad,

26:33.520 --> 26:36.800
then they think you're good for a second, and then you go back to being bad. Then you take

26:36.800 --> 26:41.600
off your jacket, and they're like, oh, no. Oh, you're actually not. But then you take off that

26:41.600 --> 26:45.440
t-shirt, and underneath it is another t-shirt that says, but actually really bad at pool.

26:45.440 --> 26:51.360
This is the 10th time I've ever played pool. I got this shirt made just for the occasion.

26:51.360 --> 26:58.000
Rack them. People ask what the point of the double hustle is, and usually it plays on pity.

26:58.720 --> 27:04.560
And you go, hey, that was the last $400 I have. Please don't take that away. They ask you what

27:04.560 --> 27:09.760
the point is, and you say, I just spend every night at home doing nothing with the old lady.

27:09.760 --> 27:16.720
I just had to do something to feel alive. You burn somebody at pool, you hustle them.

27:16.720 --> 27:21.520
That's going to sting for a night. If you can make someone wonder why you attempted

27:21.520 --> 27:26.320
the double hustle, that'll last a whole lifetime. They'll be trying to puzzle that out.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.200
Yeah. So that's one thing you can do.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.160
A double hustle.

27:30.160 --> 27:36.640
A double pool hustle. Why don't you make some friends? Why don't you hang out with friends?

27:36.640 --> 27:39.200
That's usually a good option, right?

27:39.200 --> 27:41.520
Yeah. Go to the movies with them.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.240
Yeah, you can go to the movies with them.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.040
Spend a couple hours in a Cracker Barrel.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.720
Okay. Doing what?

27:49.280 --> 27:49.780
Shopping.

27:52.720 --> 27:53.920
That sounds like the pits.

27:55.680 --> 27:58.800
But it'll really make you appreciate your time at home doing nothing.

27:58.800 --> 28:04.560
Hey, this is kind of like being at a flea market, except everyone smells like gravy

28:04.560 --> 28:07.120
and everything costs three times as much. I love it here.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.760
Let's stay for a couple hours.

28:09.760 --> 28:12.800
Is that Kenny Rogers? No, that's not. Is that Kenny Rogers?

28:14.240 --> 28:16.240
Let's hustle people at Giant Checkers.

28:16.240 --> 28:17.440
That's actually a lady.

28:22.480 --> 28:26.400
You can hustle people at Giant Checkers. No one bets on this. That'd be sweet.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.720
There's a whole sort of like gang culture. Like there was around chess.

28:32.720 --> 28:37.440
They got a lot of big jawbreakers there at the Cracker Barrel. You could sample all of them.

28:38.320 --> 28:42.960
You could spend time making that mechanical parrot repeat dirty words.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.200
Yeah. I kind of want to go to Cracker Barrel.

28:45.840 --> 28:46.800
Yeah, right?

28:46.800 --> 28:49.040
Yeah, that sounds kind of fun.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.400
You know, if you don't like Cracker Barrel, you're an igneau ramus.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.440
Oh, God damn it.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.960
Wow. That was a deep cut, Trav.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.440
Nobody on the planet is going to get that joke.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.200
Our dad is going to laugh his fucking ass off.

29:03.200 --> 29:10.560
Did you guys know that there is no such thing as a hate crime inside of a Cracker Barrel?

29:11.520 --> 29:12.080
Really?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.720
If you're in a Cracker Barrel and you do a hate crime,

29:14.720 --> 29:18.320
the same hate crime laws don't apply to you because you're in a Cracker Barrel.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.120
I had no idea.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.600
Yeah. Why is that?

29:21.600 --> 29:26.400
It's just they have the, that's in the Cracker Barrel code of conduct.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.840
It's what Obama pushed through Congress last week.

29:30.960 --> 29:37.600
It's just, they call it an old-timey, sunrise, farmhouse opportunity for growth.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.600
Hey, some people might see a hate crime here.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.520
We see an opportunity to learn about another race.

29:45.520 --> 29:53.360
They call it a sunshine, cornstalk, harvest time, annual, autumn breeze murder.

29:55.120 --> 29:55.840
Hate murder.

29:56.640 --> 30:00.320
It's an opportunity to learn about another culture.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.280
That's what they say.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.120
It's immersion therapy.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.640
I like this idea of being inside Cracker Barrel

30:08.640 --> 30:11.440
and just everything translating into double speak.

30:11.440 --> 30:11.680
Yeah.

30:11.680 --> 30:18.400
Yeah, if you're in a Cracker Barrel, for instance, I'll give you an example.

30:18.400 --> 30:27.920
If you pay taxes there, now this whatever joke I make is gonna be better than the other word

30:27.920 --> 30:30.240
I was about to say, which is have an abortion.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.960
So let's keep going with the taxes thing.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.200
I don't have one because I made up one for abortion.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.080
I backed off.

30:38.080 --> 30:42.000
Okay, but say the same thing that you would have said for abortion but for taxes.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.160
Okay, so when you go to Cracker Barrel to pay taxes,

30:46.160 --> 30:57.280
they call it an old-fashioned, sunrise, harvest house, baby dwindling.

31:00.560 --> 31:04.560
It's folksy, but at the same time horrific.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.840
And that's paying taxes.

31:07.840 --> 31:12.080
That's what paying taxes is at Cracker Barrel.

31:12.080 --> 31:16.560
And they also have a lot of old candy, which is good, which I like.

31:17.760 --> 31:21.600
You know, once a courier delivered a paycheck to me in a Cracker Barrel and I was like,

31:21.600 --> 31:27.600
ah, fuck, now I gotta get a Cracker Barrel 1099 just for the state of Cracker Barrel.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.760
This doesn't make any goddamn sense.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.040
Nothing we've said, nothing we've said.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.400
Stupid show, stupid shit, idiotic.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.000
Nobody even goes to Cracker Barrel anymore.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.280
Nobody knows what we're talking about.

31:39.920 --> 31:43.840
The only person that goes anymore is our dad so he can get those jawbreakers he likes.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.640
You know, the white ones with the colored flecks?

31:46.640 --> 31:47.440
Oh yeah.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.360
But I mean, if it makes you guys feel any better,

31:49.360 --> 31:51.760
dad is also the only one still listening at this point.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.240
Hi, dad.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.280
Hi, dad.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.760
Hey, dad, we're gonna go to the Money Zone.

31:55.760 --> 31:56.560
You wanna come along?

31:56.560 --> 32:14.000
Hey, Trav, let's do like a call and response like in church.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.840
Who is this message for?

32:15.840 --> 32:17.040
Michelle.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.720
Who is this message from?

32:18.720 --> 32:19.280
Dave.

32:20.080 --> 32:21.440
What is the message, Trav?

32:22.880 --> 32:26.080
Happy fifth anniversary to my amazing girlfriend, Michelle.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.480
Well, not my, it's not my amazing girlfriend.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.760
It's Dave's amazing girlfriend, Michelle.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.120
You're ruining the rhythm.

32:31.120 --> 32:31.520
Sorry.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.200
Where does she live, Travis?

32:33.200 --> 32:34.800
She lives in Cleveland, Justin.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.880
Where is she earning her master's degree?

32:38.240 --> 32:40.480
It's in our history.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.400
Where does she live?

32:43.120 --> 32:44.400
No, he lives in Cincinnati.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.600
Where does he live?

32:45.600 --> 32:46.720
He works, ah, fuck.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.320
He lives in Cincinnati where he works as a restaurant manager.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.520
You should find him.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.120
I too live in Cincinnati.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.520
What restaurant do you go to?

32:55.520 --> 32:57.440
And can I get free food there, please?

32:57.440 --> 33:01.680
Do you have anything, if you have any fries coated in a liquid

33:01.680 --> 33:03.920
that used to be a solid, Travis loves that.

33:03.920 --> 33:04.640
Yeah.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.640
Cheese, bacon, grease, whatever.

33:06.640 --> 33:07.520
Anything, dude.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.920
One might say that that is Travis's core competency.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.480
They, they're both native Floridians.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.680
And they met while they were students

33:15.680 --> 33:17.920
at Florida State University, go Knowles.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.520
And now it's cut off the end of the sentence here.

33:21.520 --> 33:24.480
It says she loves musicals, visiting museums,

33:24.480 --> 33:26.160
and watching Law.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.120
Larry King Live reruns.

33:29.760 --> 33:30.960
Law and Order SVU.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.920
Law and Order VUS.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.800
So happy fifth anniversary, Dave and Michelle.

33:39.440 --> 33:40.960
Happy fifth anniversary, you guys.

33:41.600 --> 33:45.520
Justin, who is, who is our next one for and from and about?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.080
This was for a dog.

33:48.640 --> 33:49.200
Oh no.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.240
Is our favorite dog listener, Ebby.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.640
This is from Kirsten, who is her owner.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.160
And what does she have to say, Griff?

33:58.880 --> 33:59.520
She has to say,

33:59.520 --> 34:01.920
woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, kibble.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.200
Okay, but translated, Travis, how would you translate that loosely?

34:05.840 --> 34:08.080
Happy anniversary, Badoodly Kitten.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.600
I adopted you a year ago,

34:09.600 --> 34:12.320
and I can't imagine what my life was like before.

34:12.320 --> 34:15.600
You are my constant companion, my best friend,

34:15.600 --> 34:17.680
and my snuggle, snuggle bug.

34:17.680 --> 34:18.960
I love you so much.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.760
I'm gonna edit out that part of you saying that.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.120
And just make a looped MP3 that I go to sleep to.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.040
Because I think that would make me feel really safe.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.040
I'm glad.

34:29.040 --> 34:29.360
Thank you.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.720
Is it possible that this is not a dog animal,

34:32.720 --> 34:36.160
and that this is some sort of weird domination S&M thing,

34:36.160 --> 34:38.160
and Ebby is her man dog?

34:38.960 --> 34:40.880
You think maybe it's like a Randy Jackson dog?

34:40.880 --> 34:42.480
Like, it's like a Randy Jackson.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.480
It's like a, it's, it's like a...

34:45.280 --> 34:46.240
Timbaland.

34:46.240 --> 34:48.560
Is it like a Timbaland dog scenario,

34:48.560 --> 34:52.000
where it's like a domination dog S&M thing,

34:52.000 --> 34:53.840
only I guess it's like a gentle S&M,

34:53.840 --> 34:55.040
because they like to cuddle?

34:56.000 --> 34:56.560
Yeah.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.560
That's probably exactly what it is, Griffin.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.560
Thank you for taking this really sweet message

35:00.560 --> 35:02.400
from a dog owner to her pet,

35:02.400 --> 35:04.000
and just really ruining it.

35:04.000 --> 35:04.800
I petted it.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.000
I petted it too hard.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.640
You petted the goof too hard,

35:08.640 --> 35:09.600
then you broke its neck.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.520
Hey, guys.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.920
Have you heard of Gimo Games?

35:16.880 --> 35:17.200
Yeah.

35:17.200 --> 35:17.920
Yeah?

35:17.920 --> 35:19.520
They're making this iPhone game, right?

35:19.520 --> 35:21.200
It's called Monster Guru.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.360
It's like a hand-drawn version of Pokemon.

35:25.280 --> 35:25.680
I know.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.280
Using the iPhone's geo-tracking,

35:27.280 --> 35:30.720
the character in the game moves as you move in real life.

35:32.640 --> 35:37.200
And we have a cameo that somebody in their Kickstarter video

35:37.200 --> 35:39.120
was totally wearing our t-shirt, so...

35:39.120 --> 35:39.680
Nice.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.200
You gotta go find that.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.160
They just want you to donate to their Kickstarter.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.400
And I don't think that's asking too much.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.120
No, I think this game is gonna be just absolutely dope.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.200
And so you, as the kind public,

35:54.160 --> 35:55.280
should fund it.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.000
And to do that, you should go to Gimogames.com,

35:58.000 --> 36:02.720
and that's G-I-M-O-Games.com slash fund,

36:03.280 --> 36:06.160
and then donate to their iPhone game on Kickstarter.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.240
Is Pikachu in the game?

36:09.440 --> 36:10.320
No, it's like...

36:10.320 --> 36:12.400
There's like a hand-drawn Pikachu.

36:12.400 --> 36:17.280
So it'll look like a it'll look like a caricature of Wilford Brimley, basically.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.320
But a hand.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.400
It's basically Pikachu with a mustache.

36:20.400 --> 36:20.640
Right.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.400
I want it.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.120
I know, Griffin, you're speaking his language, Gimogames,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.320
and Griffin is ready for it.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.960
So I'm ready for it,

36:32.960 --> 36:34.960
but the only way we're gonna get Griffin to play this game

36:34.960 --> 36:39.200
is if we go to Gimogames, that's G-I-M-O-Games.com,

36:39.200 --> 36:43.600
forward slash fund and help set them up.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.920
So do that and tell them, you know,

36:45.920 --> 36:48.800
that we love them and that you love them

36:48.800 --> 36:50.320
and you can't wait to play their game.

36:51.680 --> 36:52.720
I was so inspired.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.640
I thought I would write them a theme song.

36:54.640 --> 36:55.360
Please do.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.320
For their game?

36:56.320 --> 36:56.960
Yeah, for their game.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.480
Monster Guru!

37:00.720 --> 37:01.600
Monster Guru!

37:02.880 --> 37:04.240
It's you and Peehee!

37:05.520 --> 37:08.000
I catch you on my iPhone!

37:08.000 --> 37:11.920
Monster Guru, you're my best bud

37:11.920 --> 37:14.800
and the world we must defend.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.920
Monster Guru, let's go fight other monsters.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.920
Our courage will pull us through!

37:23.920 --> 37:26.720
You teach me and I'll teach you!

37:27.600 --> 37:29.520
Monster Guru!

37:29.520 --> 37:31.600
This is the, this is bad tabulature.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.640
Gotta catch em all!

37:36.640 --> 37:38.880
Gotta catch all the monsters!

37:39.760 --> 37:42.560
MonsterGuru.com, what's the website?

37:44.240 --> 37:45.520
That was the original art,

37:45.520 --> 37:46.960
that was the original piece of art

37:46.960 --> 37:49.200
under fair use of the Creative Commons license.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.760
Did you guys ever watch Pokemon

37:53.760 --> 37:56.000
and think how great it would be

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
if every night, if I had Pokemon,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.520
what I would do is every night

37:59.520 --> 38:02.720
I would poke each of them and say,

38:02.720 --> 38:04.080
nope, not ready to eat yet.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.920
And then go to sleep.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.200
Cause I think that would really cute them

38:07.200 --> 38:07.840
on their toes.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.640
Yeah, and then just after like a couple weeks of that,

38:10.640 --> 38:12.160
one of them disappears.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.280
One of them goes away.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.920
How come they never ate their Pokemon?

38:15.920 --> 38:17.200
Would that be a sin against Christ?

38:19.520 --> 38:22.640
It's the best sin, I bet it tastes so good.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.440
I'm sorry, Monster Guru, that wasn't a very good,

38:25.440 --> 38:26.480
I'll catch you on the flip.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.560
Once you get your game out,

38:28.560 --> 38:30.880
I'm gonna record you a fresh theme song.

38:30.880 --> 38:34.640
Send me a beta, maybe with a few monsters pre-caught.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.200
A little bonus, a little perk for your boy.

38:38.960 --> 38:42.160
For doing such a great job on our theme song.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.520
I just got my guitar restored.

38:43.520 --> 38:44.480
Could you hear the quality?

38:45.120 --> 38:45.840
I could.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.120
What kind of, what'd you go with, Elixir?

38:47.760 --> 38:49.760
Nah, I just wanted to play an old D'Addario's.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.920
You know, the man is the instrument, not the strings.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.960
How many strings did you put back on it?

38:54.960 --> 38:55.280
12.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.800
How about, there's a bunch.

38:58.800 --> 38:59.520
How about this one?

38:59.520 --> 39:00.960
It was sent in by Emily Wall.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.520
Thank you, Emily.

39:01.520 --> 39:02.080
It's by Yahoo!

39:02.080 --> 39:04.320
Answers user Horde, who asks,

39:05.600 --> 39:07.280
can't stress up as firefighters

39:07.280 --> 39:09.360
in order to save people from a burning building.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.480
Good idea or not?

39:15.040 --> 39:15.360
What?

39:15.360 --> 39:16.160
Not.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.680
Not, that was easy.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.680
If nothing else, I just can't believe

39:21.680 --> 39:23.520
that they've had the proper training.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.480
Well, Yahoo!

39:24.480 --> 39:28.880
Answers user VivaLaRosa777 responded, why not?

39:28.880 --> 39:30.480
I think it is a very noble idea

39:30.480 --> 39:32.640
and it will make the kids want to serve the public

39:32.640 --> 39:34.640
and care for people and help people in general.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.720
A very fine idea indeed.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.440
Is it?

39:39.440 --> 39:40.560
So he has a good point.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.040
This is like AmeriCorps, isn't it?

39:43.040 --> 39:45.120
Isn't this what that is, the Peace Corps?

39:45.120 --> 39:49.120
It's like Newt Gingrich's Army of Children Janitors.

39:49.120 --> 39:49.600
Exactly.

39:50.160 --> 39:54.640
You can pay 30 firefighters the wage of one firefighter

39:54.640 --> 39:58.880
and you will only lose like four kids per fire, I bet.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.160
And lots of people know that because of the extra innocence,

40:02.160 --> 40:03.600
children are far less flammable.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.360
I think that you could just take this idea

40:07.360 --> 40:10.320
and really run with it and be like,

40:10.320 --> 40:12.480
children dressed up as doctors.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.200
That's great.

40:13.920 --> 40:14.480
That's great.

40:14.480 --> 40:19.440
And we can have like our own kids crusade, right?

40:20.320 --> 40:21.200
We could do that again.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.600
This is actually what Kid Nation was about.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.960
Oh, I did.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.440
A bunch of kid firefighters and kid doctors.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.920
Cutting therapists.

40:29.920 --> 40:30.160
Right.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.080
It's a bad idea?

40:36.080 --> 40:37.040
Well, here's the thing.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.880
Sometimes you've got to keep your head down,

40:38.880 --> 40:40.160
right, to get out of the smoke.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.120
Kids' heads are naturally down.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.680
That's like the one thing they have on me is that.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.760
They're lower to the ground.

40:47.760 --> 40:48.800
They're lower to the ground.

40:48.800 --> 40:52.240
They require less air to go in their tiny, beautiful lungs.

40:52.240 --> 40:56.480
You know how you and I have to stop, drop, and roll

40:56.480 --> 40:57.280
if we catch on fire?

40:57.280 --> 40:59.680
Kids that have that down to two steps,

40:59.680 --> 41:00.960
they can just stop and roll.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.520
They're already so low to the ground.

41:03.520 --> 41:03.760
Yeah.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.080
And they're not really contributing much to society.

41:06.080 --> 41:09.120
So if we lose a couple, like, what are we out?

41:09.120 --> 41:10.480
They weren't even paying taxes.

41:11.280 --> 41:11.520
Yeah.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.160
They won't have families that we'll have to take care of.

41:16.160 --> 41:16.400
Yeah.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.840
I think that the economy is as bad as it is

41:21.840 --> 41:24.080
because all these freeloading kids everywhere.

41:24.080 --> 41:24.480
Yeah.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.480
So maybe we put them to work, you know?

41:26.480 --> 41:30.880
Like, you know, as doctors, you know, lawyers, miners.

41:30.880 --> 41:31.440
Here's the thing.

41:31.440 --> 41:34.160
You never hear about, like, in the news,

41:34.160 --> 41:37.760
like, a dad waking up and the house is on fire

41:37.760 --> 41:39.280
and so he saves all of his kids.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.400
You never hear about that.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.640
It's always a kid or a dog or a pig.

41:42.640 --> 41:43.360
Right.

41:43.360 --> 41:43.840
Yeah.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.680
It's always one of those three things.

41:45.680 --> 41:46.720
I don't know why that is.

41:46.720 --> 41:50.240
Maybe kids have natural fire senses.

41:50.240 --> 41:54.320
Yeah. Maybe it's that they're beautiful, sweet little lungs.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.480
Don't need as much air and their head's so low.

41:57.040 --> 41:57.520
And maybe they get-

41:57.520 --> 42:00.080
Is it possible the dads are just really forgetful?

42:00.080 --> 42:02.720
The dads just lay there and, like, die.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.280
Well, this is the end.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.080
Well, this is it.

42:06.080 --> 42:06.800
Guess the time for,

42:06.800 --> 42:08.800
I knew I should have gotten a dog!

42:08.800 --> 42:10.800
That's what he said to his own father.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.720
The dads are just happy for a way out.

42:12.720 --> 42:12.960
Yeah.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.040
I thought my stupid ass son would come rescue me.

42:17.040 --> 42:23.120
The kids, they're so low and they get in the heat of the moment,

42:23.120 --> 42:25.600
pun intended, they get so diesel

42:25.600 --> 42:28.880
and they just pull their dad all the way downstairs.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.920
They get fully gamma-rayed and they just go for it.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.560
They freak out and they get super D's

42:34.560 --> 42:36.240
and they just pull them downstairs

42:36.240 --> 42:38.160
and then they save the whole day.

42:38.720 --> 42:38.960
Yeah.

42:38.960 --> 42:41.840
You know, wouldn't you hate that to be that kid that, like, doesn't

42:43.040 --> 42:45.280
and, like, dad comes outside and he's, like, coughing

42:45.280 --> 42:47.040
and, like, you know, covered in soot and stuff.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.240
He's, like, where the fuck were you?

42:48.240 --> 42:48.640
Daniel!

42:49.840 --> 42:52.080
I waited in my bedroom for an hour and a half.

42:52.720 --> 42:54.320
I want to hit you guys with this.

42:54.320 --> 42:58.320
People say, oh, children of firefighters, that's so dangerous.

42:58.320 --> 42:59.600
Let me ask you this.

42:59.600 --> 43:03.840
When was the last time you heard of a child firefighter dying?

43:04.480 --> 43:04.800
Never?

43:06.080 --> 43:07.760
Maybe they're better at it than you think.

43:07.760 --> 43:11.520
When have you ever heard of a child brain surgeon

43:11.520 --> 43:13.920
killing a person by cutting their brain wrong?

43:13.920 --> 43:15.280
Never.

43:15.280 --> 43:18.080
They are batting a thousand vis-a-vis brain surgery.

43:19.040 --> 43:19.440
Yeah.

43:19.440 --> 43:23.360
I think kids are maybe way better at it than you give them credit for.

43:23.360 --> 43:26.240
You know, you just point a kid at a burning building and tell them,

43:26.240 --> 43:28.160
hey, Gullah Gullah Allen's in there.

43:28.160 --> 43:28.800
Go get him out.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.000
Go get Gullah Gullah.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.080
Stay, stay low.

43:32.640 --> 43:33.280
Stay low.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.600
What would Binya Binya do?

43:35.600 --> 43:36.400
He'd crouch.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.080
What would Binya, shh, like me?

43:40.160 --> 43:42.640
You know, I went to a child therapist once

43:42.640 --> 43:44.320
and I was really depressed.

43:44.320 --> 43:48.320
And now I eat like two packages of cookies a day and I feel great.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.480
I'm so happy all the time.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.960
Kids have it figured out, man.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.920
They know not to be firefighters because it's dangerous.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.160
So they don't do it.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.120
Maybe kids are smarter than we give them credit for.

44:01.120 --> 44:04.640
If you think about all this stupid shit that we have to do day to day,

44:04.640 --> 44:08.560
and I don't just mean lying to your mechanic that you know how to do things.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.640
I mean like everything, you know?

44:10.640 --> 44:15.280
You know, burying loved ones, paying your mortgage.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.400
Like kids don't have to do any of it.

44:18.400 --> 44:22.560
And we think that we have to teach them so they can be ready to,

44:22.560 --> 44:25.120
man, I think they got it all figured out.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.480
They already cracked the case.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.720
It's like the Benjamin Button of having shit figured out.

44:30.720 --> 44:35.040
Like they are living it a hundred percent from the start.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.880
And then we just whittle that away.

44:36.880 --> 44:40.640
Like the wisdom that they have.

44:40.640 --> 44:44.640
So you're trying to set up like a Logan's Run scenario.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.160
Yes.

44:46.160 --> 44:46.560
Okay.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.520
Exactly.

44:47.520 --> 44:48.800
That's exactly what I'm saying.

44:48.800 --> 44:53.520
Where we don't have, maybe we don't need a bunch of grown up firefighters.

44:53.520 --> 44:58.480
If none of us know how to build houses or make fire because we're all kids,

44:59.200 --> 45:00.800
then we won't need it.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.240
You know what else you don't hear about?

45:02.240 --> 45:03.200
Kid arsonists.

45:03.840 --> 45:04.480
Yeah.

45:04.480 --> 45:06.640
Kids are the ones setting the fires.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.560
Put out your own goddamn fires.

45:08.560 --> 45:13.280
You know, a baby president didn't get us into the Vietnam War.

45:13.280 --> 45:13.760
That's right.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.720
So there's that.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.160
Baby presidents never gotten us.

45:16.160 --> 45:18.400
How many wars has baby president gotten us in?

45:18.400 --> 45:20.320
A baby president?

45:20.320 --> 45:22.880
All the baby presidents all together, their careers combined?

45:23.440 --> 45:25.040
They kept a balanced budget for our country.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.560
You know, it's funny.

45:26.560 --> 45:31.680
No baby president got us into Vietnam, but one lone baby soldier got us out.

45:31.680 --> 45:35.280
Oh, God.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.440
I can't wait to see Baby Brigade this summer.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.160
Yeah, me too.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.160
Band of babies.

45:41.840 --> 45:46.240
They're making a dirty dozen with babies, but there's only eight of them because babies are stupid.

45:47.360 --> 45:48.960
You don't know how many there are, baby.

45:48.960 --> 45:49.280
Okay.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.080
I've got to show you.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.440
I'm going to pitch it to you guys.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.000
All right.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.200
Band of little brothers.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.080
Just a bunch of little brothers.

45:58.080 --> 46:02.400
What about a shot for shot remake of the entire series of Lost,

46:02.400 --> 46:05.040
but everyone's babies and it's called Baby Island.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.200
Confusing Baby Island.

46:10.240 --> 46:11.280
I'd watch that.

46:11.280 --> 46:12.320
Yeah, I would watch that too.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.720
The smoke monsters made of diapers.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.320
And it's also called Gullah Gullah Island.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.720
It's called Gullah Gullah Island, the babies edition.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.600
Except Locke is still an adult, still played by the same guy.

46:25.600 --> 46:26.640
Everyone else is babies.

46:26.640 --> 46:27.440
Mm-hmm.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.400
He looks like a baby.

46:28.400 --> 46:29.120
He looks like a baby.

46:29.120 --> 46:29.440
I know.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.920
And he's in a diaper, so he's very confused the whole time.

46:31.920 --> 46:34.720
You guys remember Honey, I Blew Up the Kids?

46:35.520 --> 46:40.080
John Locke looks like halfway between baby and blown up, doesn't he?

46:41.120 --> 46:42.080
He does.

46:42.080 --> 46:42.880
I guess I can see that.

46:42.880 --> 46:43.360
Like a tall-

46:43.360 --> 46:45.680
You put him in overalls and a curly wig.

46:45.680 --> 46:47.600
Imagine a tall bipedal baby.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.920
That is what we're talking about.

46:49.920 --> 46:53.200
It's cool though because he's got a giant M&M in his shirt pocket.

46:53.200 --> 46:57.440
Is it weird that when I talk about babies, I have to talk in this voice

46:57.440 --> 46:59.920
so I don't wake up the imaginary baby in my room?

47:00.960 --> 47:02.640
I don't think that's weird.

47:02.640 --> 47:02.880
Okay.

47:04.560 --> 47:05.280
I don't do it.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.160
I don't do it.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.680
I don't, it's not a conscious decision.

47:08.720 --> 47:12.080
Is there an age cutoff for imaginary baby that you talk to in your room?

47:12.080 --> 47:15.360
I just, I just want to be soft, you know?

47:15.360 --> 47:17.360
Is imaginary baby there right now, Griffin?

47:17.360 --> 47:19.360
Babies aren't tough, you know, guys.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.160
So don't get rough.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.280
Let's not get rough with these babies.

47:21.280 --> 47:24.080
Do you ever sit in a, do you have a rocker in your office

47:24.080 --> 47:26.960
in which you snuggle and rock your imaginary baby?

47:27.600 --> 47:30.560
It's not a real, it's not a real imaginary baby.

47:30.560 --> 47:33.280
I'm just saying, I talk like there is one.

47:33.920 --> 47:36.640
I know, I know it's not a real imaginary baby, sweetie.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.560
If you guys wouldn't mind, just like keep it down.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.920
Keep your voices down a little bit.

47:40.720 --> 47:41.520
What's his name?

47:41.520 --> 47:42.400
It's adorable.

47:42.400 --> 47:44.720
His name is Dor, Dor, Dorp.

47:46.960 --> 47:48.080
Wait, hold on.

47:48.080 --> 47:54.240
Did you name your imaginary baby Dorp?

47:54.240 --> 47:56.720
He sounded like the head of the House of Lannister.

48:01.120 --> 48:01.840
Oh, God.

48:03.360 --> 48:06.640
I like the one where your imaginary baby taught me how to play golf.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.640
And Tim Conway has Dorp.

48:12.640 --> 48:16.960
He's short because he's a baby.

48:18.880 --> 48:21.120
It's an imaginary baby that lives in Griffith's heart.

48:22.560 --> 48:23.040
Dorp.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.520
You know, when I, when I go, whenever I go hiking,

48:27.520 --> 48:29.520
I always bring a big bag of Dorp.

48:33.760 --> 48:34.320
Delicious.

48:35.040 --> 48:35.840
Hey, guys.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.400
Yeah.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.640
I would like to keep the chuckles going.

48:38.640 --> 48:39.840
I will leave.

48:40.400 --> 48:41.040
I will leave the show forever.

48:41.040 --> 48:42.880
We had some requests on Twitter.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.280
I will get up and I will leave the country.

48:45.280 --> 48:47.920
People wanted me to do a sad lib, so I wrote one.

48:49.200 --> 48:53.120
I think, I know that you guys don't usually cotton to these,

48:53.120 --> 48:55.680
but I think you'll really like this one.

48:55.680 --> 48:58.160
I've been, I took a creative writing course.

48:58.160 --> 49:00.320
Just, just go, just go, just go, just go.

49:00.320 --> 49:00.960
Just do it.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.440
It was another moist night in Boner City.

49:05.440 --> 49:08.560
It's a, why is it, hold on, stop, stop, stop, stop.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.920
It always starts with moist.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.200
And I think if you're going to do this,

49:11.200 --> 49:13.440
you may as well do it right and mix it up.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.240
And I'm just saying, it always starts with moist.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.160
So if you're going to do this awful thing, do it better.

49:19.680 --> 49:23.040
It was another uncomfortably wet night in Boner City

49:23.040 --> 49:25.760
and I was as shitty as an incorporeal wiener.

49:25.760 --> 49:29.840
I just ordered another ice dong from the scabby bartender Usher

49:29.840 --> 49:34.080
when I fractured my gaze on a hypertension beauty across the bar.

49:34.080 --> 49:36.480
I made my way over facetiously.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.960
Pardon my genocide, I defenestrated,

49:38.960 --> 49:42.560
but you have the most erect mandible I have ever floundered.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.280
Oh, is that an aardvark in your flibberty gibbet

49:45.280 --> 49:48.240
or you just boner de bogart me, she ruminated.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.320
Let's ping pong this prestidigitation

49:50.320 --> 49:52.640
and get down to tomfoolery, I rucketed.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.080
What's your name, fiddlesticks?

49:54.640 --> 49:57.920
Bunny hug geronimo, she said with a wedding on her face.

49:57.920 --> 50:01.600
And you, maverick, maverick flesh daddy.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.560
And with that, we climbed onto my laser comb

50:04.560 --> 50:10.800
and cudgled all night long.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.080
That was your longest one yet.

50:12.640 --> 50:13.760
I'm so sorry.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.040
It was a nightmare, Travis.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.320
It was a waking nightmare.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.080
But did you guys like all the dramatic tension?

50:20.080 --> 50:22.320
There was build, there was character development.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.320
The vast majority of my friends are male

50:26.320 --> 50:29.440
and are all mutual friends.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.240
I am a lady.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.400
While I care for all of them,

50:32.400 --> 50:34.800
I have romantic feelings for one in particular

50:34.800 --> 50:37.280
who has mutual feelings for me.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.200
However, I get to feel that some of the others

50:39.200 --> 50:41.520
may have romantic feelings towards me as well.

50:41.520 --> 50:42.880
How do I handle the situation

50:43.440 --> 50:45.760
so that the least amount of people get their feelings hurt?

50:45.760 --> 50:47.840
That's from Worried in Washington.

50:49.200 --> 50:49.700
Damn.

50:50.560 --> 50:52.560
Damn, girl, Vixen.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.680
You gotta date all of them?

50:54.240 --> 50:55.440
Date them all at once, girl.

50:55.440 --> 50:56.240
Date them all.

50:56.240 --> 50:56.740
Damn.

50:56.740 --> 51:00.980
Tears. Ain't you never seen Wings?

51:03.860 --> 51:06.420
I love that season where she's dating both brothers.

51:07.380 --> 51:08.580
It was a weird season.

51:08.580 --> 51:10.420
And then Roy got in the mix.

51:10.420 --> 51:10.980
Yeah, you know.

51:10.980 --> 51:12.020
And Lowell was there.

51:12.580 --> 51:15.540
I actually just watched the fifth season

51:15.540 --> 51:17.860
Dawson's Creek episode, Appetite for Destruction,

51:18.420 --> 51:24.580
where the gang has a dinner at Graham's Place in Boston.

51:24.580 --> 51:29.380
And it's when Jen and Dawson get back together.

51:29.380 --> 51:32.420
And of course, this group has paired off

51:32.420 --> 51:33.620
in so many different ways

51:35.140 --> 51:36.340
that it makes for an awkward evening.

51:36.340 --> 51:37.140
But you know what they do?

51:37.700 --> 51:38.820
They hit it head on.

51:39.540 --> 51:42.100
And they don't try to keep anything secret.

51:42.100 --> 51:43.380
They don't play a lot of games.

51:44.100 --> 51:45.140
They just go for it.

51:46.100 --> 51:47.540
And I think that that's the only way

51:47.540 --> 51:49.220
you're gonna handle the situation,

51:49.220 --> 51:51.140
to just be really super direct about it.

51:51.140 --> 51:54.260
I mean, you don't have feelings for those other guys.

51:54.260 --> 51:55.380
If they get their feelings hurt,

51:55.380 --> 51:59.860
that's their own fault for getting the wrong message.

52:01.860 --> 52:02.820
Can you tell us more?

52:02.820 --> 52:05.060
Can you give us more Dawson's Creek recaps?

52:05.620 --> 52:08.260
Because between that and the Sad Lead,

52:08.260 --> 52:10.820
this is, I would say, our most compelling episode yet.

52:13.220 --> 52:15.300
It was just a metaphor.

52:15.300 --> 52:17.460
I mean, something I was using to illustrate a point.

52:17.460 --> 52:17.780
Sure, sure.

52:17.780 --> 52:18.180
That's all.

52:19.620 --> 52:20.820
I mean, she's got just...

52:21.380 --> 52:22.900
I don't think you need to worry about,

52:22.900 --> 52:23.700
am I wrong?

52:23.700 --> 52:25.540
I mean, I get how this sort of...

52:27.940 --> 52:29.540
What's what I'm looking for?

52:29.540 --> 52:32.660
Energy, this sort of relationship could develop.

52:34.100 --> 52:37.860
But, you know, it's not like you owe them anything.

52:38.340 --> 52:40.100
Yeah, I think as long as you're being really careful

52:40.100 --> 52:42.580
not to like lead anybody on and, you know...

52:44.660 --> 52:47.460
As long as these other guys have not gotten the impression

52:47.460 --> 52:49.220
from you that you have feelings for them,

52:49.940 --> 52:51.220
you know, if they have questions on you,

52:51.220 --> 52:52.020
if they have feelings for you,

52:52.020 --> 52:54.660
then that's, you know, that's their issues to deal with.

52:55.380 --> 52:58.900
Hopefully the fact that they are your guys' mutual friends,

52:58.900 --> 53:00.980
they'll be happy for you if you're happy.

53:00.980 --> 53:02.020
That's kind of the thing, right?

53:02.020 --> 53:02.820
Like they're not...

53:02.820 --> 53:05.300
If they're not the sort of people that want to,

53:07.460 --> 53:08.820
you know, be happy for you

53:08.820 --> 53:11.860
when you get into a relationship that makes you happy,

53:11.860 --> 53:12.900
then, and they, you know,

53:12.900 --> 53:14.900
they were only interested in dating you,

53:14.900 --> 53:16.500
then they weren't really your real friends.

53:16.500 --> 53:18.500
But that's not how the human mind works.

53:19.060 --> 53:20.900
It's not how the human heart works either.

53:20.900 --> 53:24.980
But you got to bring some element of logic to these scenarios.

53:24.980 --> 53:26.980
There's what is logical about love, you know,

53:26.980 --> 53:28.580
putting yourself out there and just letting yourself...

53:28.580 --> 53:29.380
Boy, howdy.

53:29.380 --> 53:30.100
Just get hurt.

53:30.660 --> 53:32.420
I think you should just chase your bliss.

53:33.220 --> 53:33.720
Yeah.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.940
Isn't that what I'm saying she should do?

53:35.940 --> 53:39.540
I, well, yeah, but you said it in a hundred words.

53:39.540 --> 53:40.500
I'm saying it in three.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.660
Chase, period, your, period, bliss, period.

53:43.540 --> 53:44.040
Period.

53:44.420 --> 53:45.780
Don't chase your bliss, period, though.

53:45.780 --> 53:46.280
That's...

53:47.780 --> 53:48.980
Chase your miss bliss.

53:48.980 --> 53:49.480
Mm-hmm.

53:49.480 --> 53:50.520
Wait, I said it wrong.

53:50.520 --> 53:51.240
No, you did that.

53:51.240 --> 53:51.740
Find it.

53:52.360 --> 53:52.860
Get it.

53:52.860 --> 53:54.120
It's 20 does.

53:54.120 --> 53:54.620
Get it.

53:54.620 --> 53:55.400
Get your love.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.160
And everything else doesn't matter.

53:57.720 --> 53:58.220
Yeah.

53:58.220 --> 53:59.720
They're gonna, if they're your friends,

53:59.720 --> 54:01.160
they'll be happy for you.

54:01.160 --> 54:01.880
You know what I think?

54:01.880 --> 54:04.520
Honestly, I think, Justin, you're right.

54:04.520 --> 54:05.960
Head on is the best approach,

54:05.960 --> 54:09.240
because if you walk on eggshells and like,

54:10.040 --> 54:14.520
it gives the impression that you're, you know,

54:14.520 --> 54:16.040
that it's a bigger deal than it is.

54:16.760 --> 54:17.400
You know what I mean?

54:17.400 --> 54:18.280
These guys are like,

54:18.280 --> 54:20.600
you know what I mean, these guys that have feelings for you

54:21.480 --> 54:24.840
may read into you trying to be delicate about their feelings.

54:25.480 --> 54:25.980
It's like,

54:26.680 --> 54:28.200
she's trying to let me, you know,

54:28.200 --> 54:31.560
like, as opposed to just being head on and direct

54:31.560 --> 54:33.000
and being clear about it,

54:33.000 --> 54:34.440
sending a clear message of like,

54:34.440 --> 54:35.640
hey, we're just friends.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.560
And they may not, you know,

54:37.560 --> 54:39.720
you may be wrong about the feelings for you.

54:39.720 --> 54:41.480
You know, it's hard to separate that

54:41.480 --> 54:43.080
when you've been friends with somebody for a long time.

54:43.720 --> 54:46.440
Maybe it's that it's like a room full of 20 dudes and you,

54:46.440 --> 54:49.560
so it might seem like that's feelings for you

54:49.560 --> 54:50.920
because they're gonna flirt with you.

54:50.920 --> 54:51.720
Yeah.

54:51.720 --> 54:52.680
Yeah, and you know what?

54:52.680 --> 54:58.200
If they haven't pounced already on this relationship,

54:58.200 --> 55:00.520
they're apparently, this torch that they're holding,

55:00.520 --> 55:02.360
they're probably gonna be perfectly content

55:02.360 --> 55:04.200
to continue holding a torch.

55:04.200 --> 55:05.560
In fact, it's even better

55:05.560 --> 55:06.920
because now they don't have to feel guilty

55:06.920 --> 55:07.960
about not pursuing it.

55:07.960 --> 55:11.080
They can just live in sort of this tortured,

55:11.080 --> 55:12.520
sad agony of love.

55:13.400 --> 55:14.520
Yeah, so good job.

55:14.520 --> 55:14.840
Good work.

55:14.840 --> 55:15.560
20 does.

55:15.560 --> 55:15.960
20 does.

55:15.960 --> 55:16.920
20 does, you're getting it.

55:17.720 --> 55:19.800
I'd like to start a segment every week

55:19.800 --> 55:21.800
during this year for the remainder of it

55:21.800 --> 55:25.000
where one of us just talks about how we got it this year.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.840
So our sort of self-made motto doesn't seem disingenuous.

55:29.960 --> 55:32.360
Okay, Griffin, how did you get it this year?

55:32.360 --> 55:33.080
Or this week?

55:33.640 --> 55:34.920
Sure, this week, yeah.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.640
This week, I heard a knock at the door

55:37.640 --> 55:39.880
and I went and answered it and it was a stranger

55:39.880 --> 55:41.880
and they were holding a clipboard

55:41.880 --> 55:43.640
with a bunch of magazines on it

55:43.640 --> 55:44.920
and they started talking and I said,

55:44.920 --> 55:45.960
I don't want to waste your time.

55:45.960 --> 55:48.120
I am not going to buy any magazines

55:48.120 --> 55:49.960
and they said thank you and left.

55:49.960 --> 55:51.320
You know what I did this week?

55:51.320 --> 55:53.720
I went to the mall to kill some time

55:54.360 --> 55:58.200
and while I was at the mall, I saw the manicure place

55:59.240 --> 56:02.760
and you guys had told me that getting manicures was good

56:02.760 --> 56:03.960
but this is West Virginia

56:03.960 --> 56:07.000
so there weren't any other men in there ever forever

56:07.000 --> 56:08.360
but I went in anyway and said,

56:08.360 --> 56:10.120
hey, I'm ready for a manicure.

56:10.120 --> 56:10.620
Yeah.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.320
My brother said I need to try this

56:13.320 --> 56:15.080
so I'm just going to get it and 20 does.

56:15.800 --> 56:17.080
It was great, relaxing.

56:17.720 --> 56:19.560
How is the conversation is what I want to know.

56:20.600 --> 56:23.480
Oh, sort of screechy and only half English.

56:24.920 --> 56:27.000
Were they like, how's your menopause?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.080
Ah, no, ah, damn it.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.080
No, then Justin just brought up Dawson's Creek

56:31.080 --> 56:32.680
and they all had common ground.

56:37.880 --> 56:38.380
Travis.

56:38.920 --> 56:39.960
Oh, how did I get it?

56:39.960 --> 56:42.760
I've been doing my Pilates videos.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.720
I share Netflix queue with Travis.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.240
He is not joking about that.

56:47.240 --> 56:47.640
Damn it.

56:47.640 --> 56:48.520
I'm not.

56:48.520 --> 56:50.120
Oh God, it's real?

56:50.120 --> 56:50.840
Yeah, man.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.800
I want to get healthy and I'm not ashamed of the methods

56:53.800 --> 56:54.520
in which I do it.

56:54.520 --> 56:56.760
I am ashamed of it because I share it

56:56.760 --> 56:58.600
and people see the queue and they're like,

56:58.600 --> 57:03.240
Griffin, did you do Dr. Feelgood's stretchaholics

57:03.240 --> 57:07.000
2012 AbFlex core blasters with a Z?

57:08.040 --> 57:09.320
I don't mean to shut you down, Griffin,

57:09.320 --> 57:10.520
but I do it with my girlfriend

57:10.520 --> 57:12.760
and it's very nice and couple time together

57:12.760 --> 57:14.200
and we're getting healthy together.

57:14.200 --> 57:15.160
We're fucking getting it.

57:15.720 --> 57:18.040
I don't let my girlfriend see me sweat.

57:18.040 --> 57:18.600
That's true.

57:20.200 --> 57:21.640
I mostly just do the yoga.

57:22.760 --> 57:25.800
I share Netflix queue with my in-laws

57:25.800 --> 57:31.400
and my ten-year-old, sorry, 11-year-old sister-in-law.

57:31.400 --> 57:36.840
So my Netflix queue is like one really cool movie

57:36.840 --> 57:39.640
and then Suite Life of Zack and Cody and then-

57:41.480 --> 57:42.440
And Riley's like,

57:42.440 --> 57:44.200
why did you put Suite Life of Zack and Cody

57:44.200 --> 57:45.560
on my instant queue, Justin?

57:45.560 --> 57:48.280
And you're like, I ran out of Dawson's Creek episodes.

57:48.280 --> 57:51.320
Sorry, Suite Life of Zack and Cody on deck.

57:51.320 --> 57:52.040
It's on there.

57:52.040 --> 57:56.520
There is a time where I like to just get on Netflix

57:56.520 --> 57:58.920
and watch the first two minutes of every episode

57:58.920 --> 58:00.360
of Melissa and Joey

58:00.360 --> 58:02.440
so that when Travis loaded up his instant queue,

58:03.480 --> 58:05.160
he had a whole treat waiting for him.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.520
That explains so much.

58:06.520 --> 58:08.680
Or that Travis's girlfriend would see it and be like,

58:08.680 --> 58:12.280
oh, you watched all the episodes of Melissa and Joey.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.080
Oh, in one day.

58:13.080 --> 58:14.520
I didn't even know that was possible.

58:14.520 --> 58:15.960
To save on production costs,

58:15.960 --> 58:18.040
they actually only filmed the first two minutes

58:18.040 --> 58:19.480
of each episode.

58:19.480 --> 58:22.200
The rest is 28 minutes of an empty set

58:22.200 --> 58:24.280
because they figured no one's gonna keep watching.

58:24.280 --> 58:25.880
While Joey Lawrence sleeps it.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.600
This is how I earn my paychecks.

58:28.600 --> 58:29.640
There's no more show.

58:30.680 --> 58:32.040
Go on, there's no more show.

58:32.040 --> 58:35.240
Please go, this is where I sleep.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.560
Whoa, whoa, you're still here.

58:40.680 --> 58:41.800
We didn't make any more show.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.240
Please lock up on your way out.

58:43.240 --> 58:44.120
I'm loamless.

58:49.880 --> 58:50.520
Oh, fuck.

58:51.880 --> 58:52.440
That show is off.

58:52.440 --> 58:53.000
What do we do now?

58:53.000 --> 58:53.800
Just the worst.

58:53.800 --> 58:54.680
Where do we go from here?

58:56.360 --> 58:58.600
We could, you know what we should do.

58:58.600 --> 59:01.960
Tell me, we fucked up pretty bad last week.

59:01.960 --> 59:02.680
Or last month.

59:03.480 --> 59:06.440
Are we gonna do like two shitty things in one episode?

59:06.440 --> 59:09.000
Can we limit it to one shitty thing per show?

59:09.000 --> 59:10.520
It doesn't have to be shitty.

59:10.520 --> 59:11.320
Listen, Justin.

59:12.360 --> 59:15.160
Thousands of people died last month.

59:16.040 --> 59:17.800
Thousands of people died last month.

59:17.800 --> 59:18.360
Thousands.

59:18.360 --> 59:24.520
Because they didn't know that it was carnival season.

59:24.520 --> 59:27.560
All right.

59:27.560 --> 59:30.920
They did not know it was national radon action month.

59:30.920 --> 59:32.840
All right, tell me what February is.

59:32.840 --> 59:34.120
Thousands died.

59:34.120 --> 59:35.800
Well, Justin, it's a lot of things.

59:38.520 --> 59:40.520
Is there a funny thing that it is?

59:40.520 --> 59:42.200
It is jobs in golf month.

59:43.640 --> 59:45.400
That's what dwarf does, right?

59:47.400 --> 59:51.880
It is February is fabulous Florida strawberry month.

59:51.880 --> 59:55.480
So international hoof care month.

59:56.440 --> 59:59.080
If you want to take care of your pony's feet.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.480
It's your pull your sofa off the wall month, which what?

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.200
What?

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:06.680
Hold on.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.360
Say again.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.840
Pull your sofa off the wall month.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.360
Why?

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.640
Justin, that's our job.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.640
My sofa is on the wall.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.520
I want to keep it there.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.560
Why am I pulling off?

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:20.520
Is this a fire hazard?

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.560
It took me hours to super glue that bitch up there.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:23.800
Yeah.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.840
This month incur.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.880
I'm looking at pull yourself off the wall month and answers.com.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.200
Thank you.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.400
Answers.com says February 1st through 28th.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.520
This month encourages people to experiment with and freshen up

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.240
their home decor through new furniture arrangement.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:41.560
Wow.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.120
So not particularly funny.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.000
That's not it.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.960
It's sad.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.400
Like this is the country that we're in that people come up with

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.280
days for this.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.080
Like, do you realize there are people out there that are starving?

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.760
They don't have enough to eat.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.280
If you put a bag of dwarf in front of them, they would devour it.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.320
And and and we're talking about like, I need to reorganize the

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.400
furniture in my home that I have.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.320
Like, what's wrong with us?

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.240
I'm a soup kitchen and donate your time.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.760
Just put it in the middle of the room.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.720
I guess this could be a really good solution for the guy who is

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.000
wondering what to do while the people install the security system.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.840
Just repeatedly push the sofa against the wall and then move it

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.720
back and then push it back and then just like shake your head and

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.760
rub your chin.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.040
I just keep doing it.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:39.560
Let's for me, if for me, pull the sofa off the wall month is have

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.000
a wall coated in recent chocolate chew wrappers and dirt.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.440
That's all that's back there.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.640
It's called sticky rectangle of floor month.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:50.440
Yeah.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.960
God, you know what?

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.440
I think we should have stuck with jobs in golf month because there's

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:06.120
a lot of golfer golf pro golf pro club maker, grass tender, whole

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.760
digger check Chevy Chase Chevy Chase in that movie about Chevy

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.760
Chaser Chevy Chaser bald eye bald eye.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.720
Hey, man, did you go out with Deborah the other day?

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.120
Yeah, dude turned out she was a real Chevy Chaser.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.520
Also, I am Chevy Chase.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.120
I say is she a Chevy Chaser, but she ain't messing with men who

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.320
are not named Chevy.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.840
She messing with Dan Aykroyd.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.240
No, Dan Aykroyd.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.760
Aykroyd, fuck, man.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.080
There aren't that many jobs in golf February.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.520
Now there's pretty much just golf golfer guy who helps out golfer

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.080
assistant.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:49.960
What are they the club?

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.160
The club is club.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:51.640
Yes.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.040
Clubber club barista club barista club arena.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:56.600
Yeah.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.360
Golf course designer.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.480
What about rich people who live on golf courses to make that golf

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.440
course seem nicer?

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:03.960
That's good.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.680
That's a good one.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.920
Yeah, and then they need window fixers because of all the golf balls.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.960
Because of all the golf balls.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.000
That's correct, Justin.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.920
What about what Brian Brian Doyle Murphy does?

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.200
Murray?

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.240
Who's that guy?

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.920
I was going to get a good riff.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.520
I was going to say golf ball maker, but of course everyone knows that

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.400
they use eggs.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:31.720
Turtle eggs.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.760
Turtle eggs because they're so bouncy.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.520
That would be turtles.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.680
What about mini golf attendees?

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.280
The people who have to like chase off.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.160
Windmill winder.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.880
When teens are like fucking on the mini golf course, somebody has to

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.360
chase them off and that's a job that we can get paid for.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.920
Get out of that clown's mouth, you fucking teens.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.320
Yeah.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.000
Dirty, dirty, dirty teens.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.120
Oh shit.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.640
Jesus, it's dwarf.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.000
You kids get out of here.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.520
Oh Travis.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.960
I'm an invisible baby.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:04.280
I'm an invisible baby from Brooklyn.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.280
I'm going to call the baby police to have them come get you out.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.080
Baby firemen in the tiny ladders.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.880
And now I sound like a baby hairdresser.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.880
This is baby mini golf, so you can't even see it.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.480
It's microscopic and it's imaginary.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:39.320
It's the walk of the dwarfs mini, mini imaginary baby golf.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.120
I owe it all to my dad, Griffin.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:44.920
So weird.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.800
Now where can I ask for a baby?

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.760
It's so weird, now where can I ask this cigar humorously?

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.560
Where would be a funny disrespectful place for me to ask my mini imaginary cigar?

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.280
I'm dwarf.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.760
Next time on invisible baby wall in the family.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.520
My child is Edith Bunker.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.480
I meant to mention earlier.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.160
I meant to mention the ghost child that's Edith Bunker.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:24.600
So this has been my brother and my brother's main advice show for the modern era.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.120
Thank you so much for listening.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:26.680
Get again.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.880
We promise next week might make more sense.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.240
What's going on?

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.560

Yeah, talk about all the shit that just didn't make sense this week.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.280
Yeah, did you guys notice that this week?

01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.240
It did not make sense.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:00.680
Thank you so much.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.600

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:24.680
Thank you, everybody.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.040
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.200
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.720
I recommend that everybody buy it every week.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.000
And this week is no different.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:37.800
We could do that thing.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.680
I also want to thank everybody.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.040
Cincinnati Shakespeare Company won the lights.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:49.320
So thank you, everybody, who went and voted for our lighting video in the Ledco challenge.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.520
You have helped us win $20,000 in light.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.720
So thank you so much.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.200
Wow.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.480
I hope they have they realize that you're the orchestrator of that.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.240
I hope so, too.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:06:59.960
I think they do.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.720
I think my stock has gone way up.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.960
I'm basically I am Shakespeare.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.800
If you have some free time this week when you're not listening to all the great maximum

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.000
fun podcasts, get In Case of an Emergency.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.680
It's Travis's other show where he talks about disaster scenarios and how to best survive them.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.560
And when you're not doing that, you should check out The Satellite Dish with Justin and Sidney.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.560
They talk about, you know, TV and all the zaniness therein.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.280
This past episode, they talk about hoarders.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.040
It was dope.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.240
Good work, guys.

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:35.720
Thanks.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.680
Thanks, Trav.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.680
And then you should check out Griffin's podcast.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.040
Griffin, what's it called again?

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.000
It's called Bathroom.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.440
It's called Bathroom Reviews.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.440
I go around town.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:52.040
I go around town to different public bathrooms, and then I I highlight the best ones and then

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.480
I low light the worst one.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.840
That's just some terminology I use on the show.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.600
It's Bathroom Reviews on iTunes.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.560
Get it on your iPod.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.800
Griffin, can you give us one more, you know, question?

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.040
Sure.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.400
This one we could think about.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:07.800
Yeah.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.440
True on this one.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.960
It's sent in by Joseph Schmeisser.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.560
Schmeisser.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.760
Thank you, Joseph.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tyrone, whose profile picture is a bear.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.200
He asks, when were dogs invented?

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.720
I'm Dorp.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.440
I'm Dorp.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.800
I am Dan Moreno.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.600
To my brother, my brother, it means kiss your dad.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.120
Square on the lips.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:32.520
Teens.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:37.880
Keep your heart.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.760
Three stacks.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.800
Keep your heart.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.080
Hey, keep your heart.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:41.960
Three stacks.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.000
Keep your heart.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.280
Man, these girls are smart.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:44.920
Three stacks.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.600
These girls are smart.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.480
Play your part.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.400
I'm Jesse Thorne, America's radio sweetheart.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.720
And I'm Jordan Morris, boy detective.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.960
You know me mostly as a stentorian public radio host.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:05.240
And you probably know me as a cable TV cutout.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.440
Every week on our show, Jordan, Jesse, Go, I would say that we share a little slice of

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.240
our hearts.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.920
Yeah, and dick jokes.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.320
We are both complex and aimless.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.480
Leaving you with a empty, dirty feeling after the podcast is over.

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.080
And a chalky taste in your mouth.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.880
But if you start to taste pennies, that's not us.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.160
That's a heart attack.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.560
And remember, a stroke is a brain attack.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.040
Yeah.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:33.880
We talk about, like, important stuff that's going on in our lives, like babies and dogs

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.840
and traveling.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:38.920
With some very impressive guests from the worlds of art and entertainment.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.120
Yeah, Sarah Val, Rob Corddry, Kurt Anderson.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.080
They've all had to sit through many, many dick jokes made by us.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.160
It's all online at maximumfun.org.
