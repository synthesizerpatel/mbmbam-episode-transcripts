00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.880
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:46.880 --> 00:51.760
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.760 --> 00:58.560
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis of McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:58.560 --> 01:06.080
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, you wascally wabbit.

01:06.080 --> 01:12.480
Happy birthday to you. Hi, everybody. We're celebrating the life of Bugs Bunny,

01:12.480 --> 01:18.640
who turns 80 years old today. I mean, he doesn't. So excited to have...

01:18.640 --> 01:22.800
He's not on the show, but if he was, I think he'd sound a little something like this.

01:22.800 --> 01:30.480
Okay, but he wasn't born, right? So he'll never die.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.360
He was born. Just because he never died doesn't mean he was born.

01:33.360 --> 01:40.080
Well, let's not be so quick to judge, because Maude Flanders died famously of Simpsons,

01:40.080 --> 01:48.160
so there is precedent that cartoon characters can pass away, and we write about it in our TV guide,

01:48.160 --> 01:51.680
and we try to solve who shot Mr. Burns, and it's very important to us.

01:51.680 --> 01:58.480
So Bugs Bunny could get very, very sick, Travis, with some sort of disease for rabbits.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.560
Yeah, some kind of carrot-related thing.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.240
Some sort of thing like that, yes.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.880
Like maybe he ate some tainted carrots and shit himself to death.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.640
And he's little. Rabbits are little. It wouldn't take much, would it?

02:10.640 --> 02:13.040
And you're thinking about it now. He's a fragile little guy.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.680
We have to protect this 80-year-old rabbit, man.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.960
You know, I never cared for his antics. I'm just going to put it right out there.

02:18.960 --> 02:24.240
Okay. Of all the kind of cartoon, I would say, figureheads,

02:25.520 --> 02:34.160
I always found Bugs Bunny's acerbic wit and japery to be a little bit on the mean side.

02:34.160 --> 02:39.920
This is now the moment where we can exclusively reveal that Travis was adopted.

02:39.920 --> 02:47.520
His birth name was Travis Fudd, and I'm glad we could finally put that out into the world.

02:47.520 --> 02:52.640
I don't think you have to be cut from that particular bald, impotent cloth to hate this rabbit.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.320
I think dude sucks.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.200
You watch Space Jam, fucking Lola Bunny shows up like,

02:57.200 --> 02:59.360
hey everybody, check out how good I am at basketball.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.600
And this fucking idiot rabbit's like,

03:01.600 --> 03:03.280
I have a boner.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.560
It's like, yo, she didn't come here for you to do that, Bugs.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.560
She came here to play basketball with Michael Jordan,

03:10.560 --> 03:12.400
which is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.560
If I rolled up to that gym and was like,

03:14.560 --> 03:16.320
let me play basketball, show you how good I am.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.640
Tash, check out how good I am at dunking.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.280
And fucking Wile E. Coyote was like, let me fuck you.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.480
I would be like, this is not what I signed up for.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.320
Okay, Griffin, to be fair, please don't besmirch Wile E. Coyote.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.960
He'd buy you dinner first and he would ask for consent.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.680
He would hold up a little sign that would say, gotta fuck you.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.200
He wouldn't say it out loud.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.240
He would hold up a sign that said, would it be okay if I fucked you?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.600
Can I talk about the stuff that I want to talk about with Bugs Bunny?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.960
Is it about how much he sucks?

03:44.960 --> 03:47.440
I did my research on Bugs Bunny.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.000
I put up some facts and figures and stats.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.320
And I have two things I'd like to share with you about Bugs Bunny.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.840
Thank you, The Mental Floss, as always,

03:54.560 --> 03:58.400
for pairing all of human history down to the real tank nugs.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.200
Here's one fact that I'd like to discuss.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.200
In several psychological studies about false beliefs,

04:05.200 --> 04:08.080
scientists have shown people fake advertisements for Disney World

04:08.080 --> 04:09.440
featuring Bugs Bunny.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.360
A significant portion of subjects then claim to remember going to Disney

04:13.360 --> 04:16.560
and meeting Bugs, even though Warner Brothers character

04:16.560 --> 04:19.360
would never be on display at a Disney theme park.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.960
Now, okay, hey.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.760
I want to be the, I want to hang out with these people like,

04:23.760 --> 04:26.000
yeah, I fucking saw Bugs Bunny.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.200
I remember when I was there, it was me and the mouse and Bugs.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.600
All three of my best friends just hanging out.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.520
How much time do you think there had to be

04:33.520 --> 04:36.320
between showing them these fake ads and then asking them like,

04:36.320 --> 04:37.280
hey, look at this ad.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.560
Do you remember this?

04:38.560 --> 04:39.200
Yes.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.320
Yeah, I guess.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.840
Do you remember when you saw Bugs Bunny?

04:41.840 --> 04:44.160
Oh yeah, I think he was there.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.000
Although, yeah, to be fair to science,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.920
to be unfair to science, I guess I should say,

04:47.920 --> 04:50.400
to be fair to these people who were in a study,

04:51.680 --> 04:56.480
you showed me a commercial for Disney World featuring Bugs Bunny

04:56.480 --> 04:59.040
and then they're like, is Bugs Bunny in Disney World?

04:59.040 --> 05:02.960
I would probably say, well, it'd be a fucking weird commercial if he's not, huh?

05:02.960 --> 05:05.520
They're gonna have a lawsuit on their hands, huh?

05:05.520 --> 05:09.360
Who is wasting their time making false Disney World ads if not?

05:09.360 --> 05:10.080
That's weird.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.880
I mean, to be fair, there is a lot of weird stuff at Disney now.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.360
Sometimes I'm reminded that the Muppets are owned by Disney

05:15.360 --> 05:17.360
and that seems interesting and strange.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.000
But if someone said, was Bugs Bunny at Disney?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.120
I'd be like, I don't know, man.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.600
You said you'd give me a hundred dollars if I did this study.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.720
Is that now?

05:24.720 --> 05:27.840
Do I, is it check or cash or what's the deal?

05:28.800 --> 05:33.200
My second fact about Bugs is in 1961,

05:33.200 --> 05:35.760
Mel Blanc, who voiced Bugs Bunny,

05:35.760 --> 05:38.800
got into a serious car accident that left him in a coma for weeks.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.320
Eventually a doctor tried to get the unresponsive patient to talk

05:42.320 --> 05:45.520
by asking him, Bugs Bunny, how are you doing today?

05:46.240 --> 05:49.920
Blanc responded in Bugs' voice, what's up, doc?

05:49.920 --> 05:52.080
Later the doctor would say of the incident,

05:52.080 --> 05:55.440
it seemed like Bugs Bunny was trying to save his life.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.400
Oh God.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.320
That's not a good, and that doctor's license to do literally anything

06:00.320 --> 06:02.560
that involves helping people medically,

06:02.560 --> 06:05.040
touching people, being near people was instantly-

06:05.040 --> 06:08.560
Driving a car, he shouldn't be allowed to do anything.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.320
So this, so are you telling this doctor after this moment

06:12.320 --> 06:14.880
like went back to the other doctors as like,

06:14.880 --> 06:17.920
Bugs Bunny is, listen, I know how this is gonna sound,

06:17.920 --> 06:19.520
but Bugs Bunny is in there

06:19.520 --> 06:22.000
and he's trying to help me save this man's life.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.880
Anyways, I'm gonna go write a movie called Monkey Bone now,

06:24.880 --> 06:26.160
if you'll excuse me.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.560
The next morning he came in all embarrassed like,

06:28.560 --> 06:32.400
guys, I'm sorry, I watched Patch Adams 30 years before it came out

06:32.400 --> 06:36.320
and it led me to some questionable decisions.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.320
Hate this fucking rabbit.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.520
This is what I'm saying.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.880
I'm done with him.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.520
You know, if Donald Duck was talking shit,

06:44.080 --> 06:46.720
Mickey wouldn't trick a hunter into shooting him.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.960
That's what I'm saying, right?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.320
Like Mickey Mouse would never be like,

06:50.320 --> 06:52.560
ha ha, it's duck season, fucker.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.320
Like he wouldn't do that.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.360
Yeah, it's like if Peg like Pete was there

06:57.360 --> 06:58.880
and he was terrorizing Mickey Mouse,

06:58.880 --> 07:02.160
Mickey Mouse wouldn't be like, stop Donald to death instead.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.960
Yeah, yeah.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.360
We were watching a Donald Duck cartoon recently

07:07.360 --> 07:11.360
and my two-year-old just out of nowhere

07:11.360 --> 07:13.840
and loudly announced, Donald Duck is a grass hole.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.080
What?

07:16.080 --> 07:18.640
He said, Donald Duck, he's a grass hole.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.880
And we, after a little bit of searching and digging,

07:22.880 --> 07:26.480
we found out that she had confused him with Donald Trump

07:26.480 --> 07:29.440
and was just echoing things that we had said around the house.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.240
All right, cool.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.720
So Donald Duck is a grass hole now.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.840
Is that how you sort of like get your political frustration out?

07:35.840 --> 07:37.760
You walk around your house loudly proclaiming

07:37.760 --> 07:40.000
that Donald Trump is an asshole?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.760
No, my five-year-old does that.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.400
Oh, okay.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.400
And then so.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.520
Okay, cool.

07:45.520 --> 07:45.760
Okay.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.120
I was gonna say that's probably not,

07:47.120 --> 07:48.800
that ain't gonna move the needle.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.240
That ain't gonna move the national conversation forward.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.760
It's a big tit at our house.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.680
We like to let all political abuse.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.240
Foment.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.120
All right.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.920
This is an advice show and it's specifically an advice show

08:01.920 --> 08:03.200
on the Maximum Fund Network,

08:03.200 --> 08:07.280
which is more specifically doing its annual pledge drive,

08:07.280 --> 08:09.760
the Maximum Fund drive.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.720
Maximumfund.org slash join is the address

08:12.720 --> 08:16.880
where you can go right now and support the shows that you love.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.640
You listen to Bim Bam, Sawbones, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

08:20.640 --> 08:22.400
Jordan and Jesse Go, The Adventure Zone,

08:23.600 --> 08:25.600
whatever, Switchblade Sisters, you name it.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.640
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.440
All those great shows need your support now.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.160
And the cool thing is if you can pledge a few bucks a month

08:32.160 --> 08:34.240
or a lot of bucks a month, whatever works for you,

08:34.240 --> 08:35.520
we know there's a weird time for money.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.040
So whatever you can do, we really appreciate it.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.920
But that money goes directly to the shows you listen to.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.000
You choose the shows you listen to when you sign up

08:42.000 --> 08:44.160
and Max Fund takes a small portion

08:44.160 --> 08:46.720
to sort of keep things operating on their end.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.000
They do a lot to support our shows.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.280
And then the rest goes,

08:49.280 --> 08:52.000
it just split up between the shows that you enjoy.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.440
It's a way to support the stuff you like.

08:55.440 --> 09:00.160
And I know times are weird for y'all out there financially

09:00.160 --> 09:01.040
for a lot of folks.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.840
I will say it's also pretty weird on our end.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.160
Touring and stuff like that is not currently an option for us.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.360
So we really do depend on your support

09:12.720 --> 09:14.160
to keep things going around here.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.520
So if you like what we do and you have a few spare bucks

09:17.520 --> 09:19.360
and just a few spare seconds,

09:19.360 --> 09:22.400
maximumfund.org forward slash join is the address.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.680
There's gifts too.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.040
Yeah, if you can pledge five bucks a month,

09:25.040 --> 09:26.400
you get a ton of bonus content.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.040
10 bucks a month, you get all that stuff

09:29.040 --> 09:31.760
and a beautiful pin from the show of your choice.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.760
But the real thing is you're supporting things

09:33.760 --> 09:37.120
that you love and with that,

09:37.120 --> 09:38.240
not to put too far a point on it,

09:38.240 --> 09:39.600
but we really need you.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.920
So if you can help out, if you're able to,

09:41.920 --> 09:44.240
maximumfund.org forward slash join.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.560
More like maximumfund.orgasm

09:46.560 --> 09:47.680
because that's what you're gonna have

09:47.680 --> 09:48.560
when you go to this website.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.120
Wow.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.240
I'm not gonna say it again.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.000
We didn't used to work so blue.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.720
I told you I would say it again.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.320
What are we, Redbook?

09:56.320 --> 10:03.520
Come on, can we do a question?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.560
At the office, my desk is right next

10:06.560 --> 10:08.320
to our single occupant bathroom.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.480
Unfortunately, I'm able to hear

10:10.480 --> 10:11.440
some of the louder sounds

10:11.440 --> 10:12.720
that come out of the bathroom.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.600
Oh, baby.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.440
However, there's a new guy in the office.

10:19.440 --> 10:22.000
Oh, Marmaduke, you've done it again.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.760
Snap into a slim jam.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.800
However, there's a new guy in the office

10:26.800 --> 10:27.680
who goes into the bathroom

10:27.680 --> 10:29.120
and immediately starts playing drums

10:29.120 --> 10:29.600
on his legs.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.320
Fuck yeah.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.920
The thing is, he's really good.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.920
That's funnier than our things that we said.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.840
Yeah, it's almost like you should

10:35.840 --> 10:36.960
let me get through the questions.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.960
I've been looking for a new drummer

10:38.960 --> 10:43.520
to jam with and would love to ask him

10:43.520 --> 10:44.880
to jam sometime.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.320
How do I approach the new guy

10:46.320 --> 10:47.840
and tell him that I'm impressed with him

10:47.840 --> 10:49.200
bathroom drumming and invite him

10:49.200 --> 10:50.320
to come jam?

10:50.320 --> 10:53.920
That's from shamefully shy in Chicago.

10:56.480 --> 11:00.880
Okay, we can assume this person

11:00.880 --> 11:06.080
is drumming on his legs when seated

11:07.920 --> 11:10.240
doing twosies or a comfortable onesie, right?

11:12.080 --> 11:13.360
Listen, if they're not sitting down

11:13.360 --> 11:15.680
to onesie, what are you doing?

11:15.680 --> 11:16.960
Yeah, you're wasting a perfectly good

11:17.920 --> 11:19.440
chillax opportunity.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.040
Sit down.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.080
I don't think people are standing

11:22.080 --> 11:24.560
at the urinal pulling their pants down

11:24.560 --> 11:26.640
to the point where they have exposed thighs

11:26.640 --> 11:29.120
to create that sort of sonorous slap.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.160
Yeah, it's a hand bone.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.260
Doing that.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.200
So that's important to know.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.040
Yeah, I mean, listen,

11:37.040 --> 11:39.520
if he's gonna get a good drum on,

11:39.520 --> 11:40.800
if he's gonna hand bone,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.760
he needs to get some skin.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.200
Maybe he's also pulling up his shirt

11:45.200 --> 11:46.320
to get the tummy symbol going.

11:46.320 --> 11:49.360
Oh, belly, like a deep bass drum.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.080
Yeah, right?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.120
That's the bass drum.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.160
So what would symbols

11:52.160 --> 11:53.600
and maybe like the shoulders?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.120
You get the fucking hi-hat at the like,

11:56.640 --> 11:57.360
but then you get that.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.000
Here's the problem.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.720
Let's play a game.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.200
Hold on.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.160
Can we stop?

12:02.160 --> 12:02.720
Can we stop?

12:03.600 --> 12:04.720
Let's play a game where I slap

12:04.720 --> 12:05.280
a part of my body.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.880
You guys tell me what you think it is.

12:06.880 --> 12:07.680
Okay, got it.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.720
Wait, Justin, be quiet.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.280
I hear it.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.480
I think we have played this game,

12:10.480 --> 12:11.920
this exact game before.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.800
I'm gonna say that's a clavicle.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.760
That's like a-

12:17.760 --> 12:20.160
No, you think my clavicle would make that,

12:20.160 --> 12:22.480
like there's not that much clavicle surface area

12:22.480 --> 12:24.320
to make that, it's like loud of a slap.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.200
Justin, do you want to hear it again?

12:25.200 --> 12:25.920
Are you shirtless?

12:26.560 --> 12:26.720
No.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.400
That's like your flank.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.680
Travis, you want to guess again?

12:34.240 --> 12:35.840
I'm gonna say it's your bicep.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.560
That's my foot.

12:41.120 --> 12:41.600
Wonderful.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.320
So this can be,

12:42.320 --> 12:44.560
everybody's always getting on my goners

12:44.560 --> 12:46.080
because I don't have a great segment.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.520
Like you guys have all these great segments.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.040
So maybe now in the middle of an episode,

12:49.040 --> 12:50.400
I'll be like, everybody shut up.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.280
That was my elbow.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.360
If you say that you're going to do this

12:55.360 --> 12:56.240
throughout the episode,

12:56.240 --> 12:57.200
it will be the first time

12:57.200 --> 12:58.800
that we've ever actually said that

12:58.800 --> 13:00.240
and actually followed through on it.

13:00.240 --> 13:00.480
Probably won't.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.760
We'll be doing this throughout the episode.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.120
Probably won't be doing that.

13:03.120 --> 13:03.840
Probably not.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.400
I, listen, all you got to do is let,

13:06.400 --> 13:09.920
you got to lure him out with a tasty groove.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.560
And that's the thing is with,

13:12.560 --> 13:14.480
if you're within earshot of this guy

13:15.280 --> 13:17.360
and you're just like sitting at the coffee maker

13:17.360 --> 13:18.640
and while you're sitting at the coffee maker,

13:18.640 --> 13:19.600
you just lay out a little

13:25.360 --> 13:27.520
He's going to pick up whatever sticks he can find

13:28.160 --> 13:29.360
right around you

13:29.360 --> 13:31.920
and start laying down another lick.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.040
Maybe give you a little bit of that.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.720
And then you're giving him like

13:41.200 --> 13:41.840
and he's going to do that.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.440
And then Susan from down the hall,

13:45.440 --> 13:48.480
he's going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.160
I really wish we could have built that chronically.

13:52.160 --> 13:52.720
I really like-

13:52.720 --> 13:53.600
We were.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.480
Travis helped it.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.680
Yeah, but at different times.

13:55.680 --> 13:59.200
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.680
That's going to be, actually that, you know what?

14:01.680 --> 14:03.120
I want to do a backwards segment.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.640
That's your, that's your TikTok assignment.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.680
Oh shit.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.000
Okay.

14:08.000 --> 14:08.560
That'll be a good one.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.760
I don't think that's how TikTok works.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.280
Here's the problem.

14:11.280 --> 14:11.760
Oops.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.120
No, whoa, whoa, what?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.400
The problem is this, Justin.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.480
You're going to start laying down that tasty groove

14:16.480 --> 14:19.760
and he's going to get a little embarrassed to maybe walk away

14:19.760 --> 14:20.880
and you're going to push it

14:20.880 --> 14:23.600
and find out that he is only comfortable,

14:23.600 --> 14:25.200
much like someone singing in the shower,

14:25.760 --> 14:28.960
he's only comfortable playing drums sitting on the toilet.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.960
So you're going to need to get a porta potty

14:30.960 --> 14:33.200
into your garage where you jam

14:33.760 --> 14:35.120
for him to be comfortable doing it.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.120
Now, if you can figure that out,

14:37.120 --> 14:39.040
that's a great gimmick for a band.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.120
It's a great fucking gimmick.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.280
It's like Frank sort of, but-

14:43.280 --> 14:43.840
Yes.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.400
With a guy in it.

14:46.400 --> 14:51.200
Would you have, would you cut out arm holes?

14:52.160 --> 14:53.120
Oh, cool.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.480
In the porta potty?

14:54.480 --> 14:56.400
So it's like the porta potty is playing the drums

14:56.400 --> 14:57.280
or would you put the drums?

14:57.280 --> 14:59.280
I had, I'd pictured the drums in the porta potty,

14:59.280 --> 14:59.520
but now-

14:59.520 --> 15:01.520
That's going to fuck the whole Sonic,

15:01.520 --> 15:02.480
you know what I mean?

15:02.480 --> 15:04.160
Sonically, that's not going to work.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.920
Now, now I'm seeing it

15:05.920 --> 15:08.160
and I like your version much better.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.240
Yeah, like little arms stick out of the porta potty

15:10.240 --> 15:11.120
and they're just ripping.

15:11.120 --> 15:11.680
Ooh, and let me say-

15:11.680 --> 15:15.360
I guess you got to have feet holes for the kick drum.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.360
But then an LED face

15:17.360 --> 15:19.840
so that it can take on different facial expressions

15:19.840 --> 15:20.560
like you don't really-

15:20.560 --> 15:21.600
One more time.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.880
Really getting into it, you know?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.120
It's like, oh, the porta potty is fucking rocking today

15:25.120 --> 15:27.600
and then he's biting his little LED lip or whatever.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.800
You've got, you've also got the built-in like,

15:30.800 --> 15:31.920
when you need publicity,

15:31.920 --> 15:34.000
be like, he's finally stepping out of the porta potty.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.160
You know, it's funny, actually,

15:36.880 --> 15:38.800
Neil Peart used to do this called the porta potty.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.200
It's like, not a lot of people do it.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.360
Oh, come on.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.880
You dumb piece of shit.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.400
I'm checking with the judges, hold on.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.880
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

15:48.880 --> 15:49.680
Yeah, I love that, girl.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.600
So here's a Yahoo that was sent in by,

15:51.600 --> 15:53.120
as long as we're talking about jamming on music,

15:53.120 --> 15:54.800
here's one sent in by Adrian Cowles.

15:54.800 --> 15:55.440
Thank you, Adrian.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.960
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user

15:56.960 --> 15:59.680
who I'm going to call Megan,

16:00.560 --> 16:02.640
like Megan, but with an M at the end asks,

16:04.240 --> 16:06.480
why do cello players shake their head

16:06.480 --> 16:08.960
when they play the cello?

16:08.960 --> 16:11.280
Okay, no joke.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.000
Everybody knows this.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
You look at the string quartet,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.280
the cello players are always like,

16:17.440 --> 16:18.400
always kind of grooving.

16:19.040 --> 16:24.000
I was watching a Rachmaninoff concert last night.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.960
Oh, fuck off.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.480
Well, no.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.360
Fuck him on and off.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.280
That's two.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.480
That's two in a row.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.720
And it featured a young woman playing the piano.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.320
She was really getting into it.

16:36.320 --> 16:40.720
And as much as I enjoyed her performance,

16:40.720 --> 16:41.680
all I kept thinking was like,

16:41.680 --> 16:43.280
how much more interesting it would be

16:43.280 --> 16:45.120
if she just looked really bored.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.400
If she was yawning and checking the time and stuff

16:48.400 --> 16:51.600
and playing almost like she was just killing time

16:51.600 --> 16:54.160
until some of these really difficult licks.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.920
And I think that maybe that's it,

16:55.920 --> 17:00.240
is at this point, all cello players are so good at it

17:00.800 --> 17:02.880
that they have to act like it's really hard

17:03.840 --> 17:05.920
so that people are impressed

17:05.920 --> 17:07.600
because if they showed how it was like,

17:07.600 --> 17:08.960
no, at this point, man,

17:08.960 --> 17:10.640
I'm not even thinking about it.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.080
I'm trying to remember that recipe

17:12.080 --> 17:14.560
from my grandmother's really good banana nut muffins.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.600
Like, this is easy.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.360
It's possible.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.480
It's possible.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.320
It could also be that Yo-Yo Ma started doing it

17:20.320 --> 17:21.120
and everybody was like,

17:21.120 --> 17:24.000
well, if Yo-Yo's, if Ma's doing it,

17:24.720 --> 17:25.040
I need-

17:25.040 --> 17:26.640
There have to be trends like that, right?

17:27.200 --> 17:29.200
Absolutely there's cellist trends.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.640
Absolutely there is.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.440
Oh, this guy started wearing real jangly bracelets.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.520
So now we're all wearing jangly bracelets

17:35.520 --> 17:36.640
so that you can hear us like,

17:38.240 --> 17:38.800
as we go.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.960
I would think bowstring composure is like a big-

17:44.160 --> 17:45.760
There's always like a new shit

17:46.640 --> 17:50.880
that's continually more sort of devious,

17:50.880 --> 17:53.120
like a more, like a worse,

17:54.960 --> 17:55.520
just worse.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.720
For the environment, worse morally,

17:58.720 --> 18:00.160
like more bankrupt.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.600
Like if it gets like cow,

18:02.320 --> 18:04.320
like baby cow innards, stuff like that,

18:04.320 --> 18:05.600
it just gets like worse and worse and worse.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.880
This is hair from the Christ.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.640
Yeah, we stole it.

18:08.640 --> 18:09.840
We stole it from the church.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.080
We hired Nicholas Cage to steal the hair of Christ.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.320
Steal a fistful of Christ hair.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.360
Yeah, do you guys know the kind of head shake

18:19.360 --> 18:19.760
that I'm talking about?

18:19.760 --> 18:20.400
Like that kind of like,

18:20.400 --> 18:21.520
oh, fuck, yeah.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.880
Yeah, I'm into it.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.040
Really going on it.

18:25.040 --> 18:25.520
Really hitting it.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.760
Well, oh, yeah, shredding these, shredding these.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.680
I'm ready to tell you, Griffin, the truth.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.400
Yeah.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.760
And I only know this because I'm an honorary cellist

18:33.760 --> 18:36.160
because I saved a cellist's life.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.680
And so now their life is mine to do it as they please.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.480
Sure, sure.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.760
Yeah, we know how it works.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.640
What a lot of people don't know

18:42.640 --> 18:44.240
if you don't play a cello is,

18:44.240 --> 18:45.920
actually the way a cello works is

18:45.920 --> 18:46.800
as you're playing it,

18:46.800 --> 18:48.640
it is fighting back the whole time.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.600
And so it's kind of like,

18:52.320 --> 18:53.760
yeah, it's like a wrestling match.

18:53.760 --> 18:57.360
So there's a lot of like kind of like

18:57.360 --> 18:59.760
throwing it back and forth that has to happen.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.480
So that head shake is like the kind of counterbalance

19:02.480 --> 19:04.320
to keep the cello from getting away.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.120
Because if it were to ever get free,

19:07.120 --> 19:09.680
that little, it has that big spike at the bottom.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.720
A dangerous.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.560
It would use that to kill everyone in the room.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.320
To hurt, yeah, at least, yeah.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.080
And then there's also the danger that, you know,

19:16.080 --> 19:17.680
a lot of times Yo-Yo Ma before he was

19:17.680 --> 19:19.360
such an accomplished cellist,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.360
he would finish a performance

19:21.360 --> 19:22.320
and then people would be like,

19:22.320 --> 19:26.320
oh, shit, where did Yo-Yo Ma just go?

19:26.320 --> 19:27.840
And then be like, ah, fuck,

19:27.840 --> 19:30.800
he got trapped inside his cello again.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.040
And you would look inside the little hole

19:33.040 --> 19:33.920
and he would be in there.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.360
Like, ah, fuck, it got me.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.720
That's why the concerts go so long.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.560
They have to wear out their cellos

19:38.560 --> 19:40.160
so that they can be put away for another night.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.200
So they can be put away

19:41.200 --> 19:43.040
or else they will not get back in their boxes.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.560
They don't like it at all.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.440
They will kill and they will not stop killing.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.040
Once they taste human blood,

19:49.040 --> 19:52.160
the cello will never rest until we are all dead.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.160
And that's why violinists are weak babies.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.040
Because it's like fight a real fucking instrument.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.120
A double bass is like, all right,

19:59.120 --> 20:02.240
fucking, wow, we get it.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.520
You're so strong.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.640
You can kick a double bass.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.280
But even that, that's why, see,

20:05.280 --> 20:06.400
the violin is too weak

20:06.400 --> 20:08.240
to really hurt human beings all that much.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.760
But a double bass is so heavy that it's easy to catch.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.520
A cello is right there in the middle.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.080
It's easily God's most dangerous creature.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.160
And then you see a swing band

20:18.160 --> 20:19.440
where they're like fucking spinning

20:19.440 --> 20:20.320
that double bass around.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.680
It's like, wow, big dick energy, anybody?

20:24.880 --> 20:25.520
Is that Bach?

20:26.640 --> 20:27.760
I don't think so.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.560
I don't know.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.080
It kind of felt like it was digging its head back in.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.240
And everyone said, that's not Bach.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.720
It's like, hey, guys, are we doing big dick?

20:36.720 --> 20:38.320
Are we doing big dick energy?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.680
Nope, not saying that.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.120
No, no more?

20:41.120 --> 20:42.080
It is problematic.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.120
Okay, I'll see.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.200
I'll try again in another couple of years.

20:45.200 --> 20:45.920
Bye.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.720
Here's another question.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.480
I just purchased a basketball for my father's birthday.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.080
Unfortunately, he decided he would go out

20:52.080 --> 20:53.600
and buy one for himself at the end of the week,

20:53.600 --> 20:55.520
two days before I was gonna give it to him.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.960
The problem is simple.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.880
How do I keep him from buying his own basketball

20:58.880 --> 21:00.400
while not letting him know what I've done?

21:01.040 --> 21:04.080
Because of everything, the store is not accepting returns.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.760
I don't want him to buy another thing.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.640
What can I do?

21:06.640 --> 21:07.600
You gotta read the name.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.080
Basketball Bungle and Benetiquette.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.760
What kind of relationship...

21:13.760 --> 21:14.800
Oh, man, I have a lot of questions.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.720
What kind of relationship do you have with your father

21:16.720 --> 21:18.560
and what kind of relationship does your father have

21:18.560 --> 21:21.680
with money and also the sporting goods store?

21:21.680 --> 21:22.880
And basketball for that matter.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.400
And basketball for that matter

21:24.400 --> 21:28.640
that he would say something like, at the end of this week.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.840
God is my witness.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.440
Listen, everyone, everyone.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.080
Gather around.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.200
Everyone, shut up and listen.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.360
This Friday afternoon, I will be going to Dick's Sporting Goods

21:41.360 --> 21:43.680
to purchase one American basketball.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.320
55 birthdays have passed in which I did not have a basketball.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.400
Another one will not come and go

21:50.400 --> 21:53.360
until I have that rubber bastard under my thumb.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.560
That is such a wild thing that I did not even process.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.760
That's what they were saying.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.840
I thought they were talking in the past tense,

21:59.840 --> 22:03.280
but no, a declaration has been made

22:03.280 --> 22:07.440
about basketball purchasing plans in the near future.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.600
Your dad is from a different generation.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.760
We're going to the store, used to be an event.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.800
People used to gather around and circle the basketballs

22:14.800 --> 22:17.440
they were going to buy or maybe just look at

22:17.440 --> 22:18.960
if they couldn't afford it.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.600
That used to be a big day out during the Great Depression

22:21.600 --> 22:25.040
just to go to the Dick's and look at the basketballs.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.520
Maybe bounce them up and down the aisles,

22:27.520 --> 22:30.560
get a sense of their action, you know what I mean?

22:30.560 --> 22:31.760
And then dream about the day

22:31.760 --> 22:33.440
when you could afford a basketball.

22:33.440 --> 22:37.200
Cut out clips of the old Sears robot catalog

22:37.200 --> 22:40.640
of some beautiful new basketballs.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.680
Why do you think, did he look when he announced this,

22:46.880 --> 22:49.520
did he maybe look knowingly at everyone

22:49.520 --> 22:54.520
thinking someone might say, no, please don't do that?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.080
Hint, hint, hint.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.160
I mean, again, a strange relationship with basketball

23:02.160 --> 23:03.200
if that is the case.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.560
Like, I really want to make sure.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.200
I'm really going to put a gun to everyone's heads

23:07.200 --> 23:08.560
on this whole basketball thing.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.520
Well, one of two things has happened.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.160
Either your father has never owned a basketball,

23:14.160 --> 23:18.800
at which point him deciding two days before his birthday

23:18.800 --> 23:23.760
to buy it is an interesting, why now, father?

23:23.760 --> 23:28.400
Or he has owned a basketball before, routinely used it,

23:28.400 --> 23:31.200
and now it is, I don't know, destroyed somehow?

23:34.800 --> 23:38.480
He loves basketball enough that both you and him

23:38.480 --> 23:40.560
have thought about getting him a basketball,

23:40.560 --> 23:44.080
but not so much that he has a basketball at the ready.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.400
Can I ask us just a stupid question?

23:49.760 --> 23:50.320
Yes. Yeah.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.760
Is Dr. Anthony Fauci on cameo?

23:57.520 --> 24:00.480
Because if he is, you could just pay him like a hundred bucks

24:00.480 --> 24:02.640
or something to do a cameo for your dad

24:02.640 --> 24:06.000
that's like, basketball is dangerous

24:06.000 --> 24:08.880
or contaminated in some way.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.720
Oh, so not as a present?

24:11.920 --> 24:13.280
No, I mean, it would be a present.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.880
You could have him be like, happy birthday,

24:14.880 --> 24:19.200
you old son of a gun, and also don't touch any basketballs.

24:19.840 --> 24:23.760
They're so dangerous and it's really bad.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.840
Unless given to you by a loved one.

24:25.840 --> 24:30.560
Unless they're my own special brand of Fauci balls.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.680
And then you are going to have to coordinate with Fauci

24:35.680 --> 24:38.400
to get him to decorate the basketball,

24:38.400 --> 24:41.840
like maybe it's just a big cool sticker that he puts on it

24:41.840 --> 24:45.120
that lets people know this is a genuine clean Fauci ball.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.800
That's a genuine Fauci.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.320
I really hope I'm saying that name right.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.320
Yeah, you're doing pretty good.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.520
I don't think he's on cameo though.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.600
When your dad says, I'm going to go buy a basketball,

24:55.600 --> 24:58.000
say no, don't buy a basketball.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.360
And he's like, why not?

24:59.360 --> 25:01.680
You say, cause basketballs are stupid.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.560
Make him feel really bad about it.

25:04.560 --> 25:09.120
Or you could pay $100 beloved Dr. Anthony Fauci

25:09.120 --> 25:10.320
to do that for you, Trav.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.440
Your idea was just a worse idea version of my idea.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.120
Hey, let me throw this out.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.200
10 minutes before he's about to leave to go to the store,

25:17.200 --> 25:19.680
hand him the basketball and say, happy early birthday.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.560
That's because that is the play.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.120
You've gotten him two presents then,

25:25.680 --> 25:27.040
you've gotten him a basketball

25:27.040 --> 25:29.680
and he doesn't have to go anywhere to get it.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.960
That would be perhaps if I were your father,

25:32.960 --> 25:37.040
which I'm not, then unless this is BB,

25:37.040 --> 25:43.040
then I would be so joyous to have just been miraculously saved

25:43.040 --> 25:45.760
any amount of effort whatsoever,

25:45.760 --> 25:48.080
then like that would make my day.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.760
What if your child just walked into the room right now, Travis,

25:51.760 --> 25:55.280
and just like launched a fucking bullet chest pass right at you

25:55.280 --> 25:57.840
like, let's go pops, happy birthday.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.440
Oh my God, I'd be so excited.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.200
I don't even like basketball, I'd be excited.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.320
Let's put it a different way.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.080
What if BB walked in and said, here on this memory drive

26:06.080 --> 26:08.880
is the rest of the episode already recorded,

26:08.880 --> 26:12.560
you can go fuck off, I'd be so excited.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.880
That would be so sick, yeah, I would love that.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.640
Right, if Henry and Charlie and BB had just gone ahead

26:18.640 --> 26:20.800
and recorded the rest of the episode for us,

26:21.360 --> 26:24.480
I mean, I'd be watching Avatar The Last Airbender right now.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.520
Cool life that you're living.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.480
Can I do another Yahoo?

26:29.200 --> 26:30.240
I love that, Griffin.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.800
I love how we're just churning through questions this time.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.520
Yeah, we're really blasting off into some new levels.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.040
Finally getting some work done.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.160
Emma can't send this in.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.920
Thank you, Emma, it's Yahoo Answers user.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.920
They are anonymous also, I'm going to call them.

26:42.480 --> 26:47.120
Preston asks, do people travel to the USA

26:47.120 --> 26:50.240
for good American food like hot dogs and burgers?

26:51.760 --> 26:52.400
Oh my God.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.800
There's gotta be some reason they're doing it

26:56.800 --> 27:01.040
because it was Broadway, but now it's not that anymore.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.200
And listen, just to be clear,

27:03.200 --> 27:07.360
there are good restaurants and good cooks in America.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.880
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.

27:08.880 --> 27:13.360
Wow, what a bold supposition, Travis.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.520
But what I like about this question is,

27:16.240 --> 27:19.440
there are good restaurants and good cooks like everywhere.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.280
What this question is asking is,

27:21.280 --> 27:23.600
is America a destination for food

27:23.600 --> 27:28.800
for specific American cuisine that you can only get in America?

27:28.800 --> 27:34.400
And like that, I do not know that there's an answer to that.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.280
If it does happen, I hope they're listening

27:37.280 --> 27:40.160
so I can give them this special public service announcement

27:40.160 --> 27:41.200
right now.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.800
Hello, my name is Justin McElroy.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.440
I host a podcast and several other podcasts.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.400
We are proud Americans.

27:46.400 --> 27:53.600
But if you love American food so much

27:53.600 --> 27:55.520
so you're thinking of coming here

27:55.520 --> 27:57.520
to eat our hot dogs and hamburgers,

27:57.520 --> 27:59.200
here would be my question to you.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.720
How much do you like hot dogs?

28:02.720 --> 28:08.000
I mean, do you really love hot dogs?

28:08.960 --> 28:11.920
Because this is a weird time for us right now.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.280
We're trying some different things out

28:15.280 --> 28:21.280
in terms of vis-a-vis managing some different situations

28:21.280 --> 28:22.960
that we have going on right now.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.160
And I mean, I hope you really like hot dogs.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.520
I mean, like you have to really, really, really love hot dogs

28:29.520 --> 28:32.000
for this to make any kind of sense for you at all.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.520
But the good news is, here's what you do.

28:33.520 --> 28:36.800
You fly here, you land in probably Atlanta,

28:36.800 --> 28:39.600
hit up that Nathan's hot dogs, get back on a plane,

28:39.600 --> 28:41.760
go right back on home.

28:41.760 --> 28:45.440
Get the, you gotta, you gotta go.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.600
Hey, bring a Justin's size suitcase with you

28:51.600 --> 28:54.000
and leave it unattended near my home.

28:54.000 --> 28:54.640
You never know.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.840
That'd be cool.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.480
Pretty neat.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.520
Swallow your boy out.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.320
Please don't do that.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.560
It's not, but it's not worth it.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.320
Come on, let's go.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.280
You'll get so sick.

29:05.920 --> 29:06.480
Get on my back.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.320
If you come here, you'll get so sick.

29:08.320 --> 29:13.760
We're going, let's go.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.360
Hey, gramps, get stamps.com.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.640
Grandpas love stamps.

29:26.640 --> 29:30.080
So what you just said, it's like their favorite thing.

29:30.080 --> 29:30.880
No, but that's what I'm saying.

29:30.880 --> 29:31.920
So they like, they're gramps

29:31.920 --> 29:35.760
because they've always used analog stamps.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.920
I'm talking about digital stamps.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.440
Okay, cyber stamps.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.120
Cyber stamps at stamps.com.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.360
Well, you should have just said that.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.720
Well, but now I'm worried

29:44.720 --> 29:46.320
that there are cyber grandpas out there.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.040
I am cyber grandpa.

29:49.040 --> 29:49.840
I hope not.

29:49.840 --> 29:54.960
Have my digital world as a new hit character.

29:55.760 --> 29:59.040
Okay, with stamps.com, you can print postage on demand

29:59.040 --> 30:01.360

30:07.920 --> 30:10.880
and no residual surcharges.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.960
Nope, residential surcharges.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.160
Hey, what about a character named surcharges?

30:16.160 --> 30:17.120
Is that anything?

30:17.120 --> 30:17.920
That sucks too.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.280
Damn it.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.120
Okay, simply use your computer

30:21.120 --> 30:23.360
to print official US postage 24 seven

30:23.360 --> 30:25.520

30:25.520 --> 30:26.800
anywhere you want to send.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.000
Once your mail is ready,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.080
just leave it for your mail carrier,

30:30.080 --> 30:32.480
schedule a pickup or drop it in a mailbox.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.840
It's that simple.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.360
And with stamps.com, you get great discounts too.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.120
Five cents off every stamps

30:39.120 --> 30:44.800

30:50.160 --> 30:52.560

30:52.560 --> 30:53.840
Just go to stamps.com,

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

30:55.840 --> 30:57.200
and type in my brother.

30:57.200 --> 31:01.360
Go to stamps.com, enter my brother, hi, I'm surcharge.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.240
And I'm cyber grandpa.

31:04.240 --> 31:04.880
It's funny, man.

31:04.880 --> 31:05.920
And we're in love.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.060
All right.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.920
And there's nothing you can do to stop that.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.880
Beep boop, eat my digital worthers.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.480
That is good, Trav, it felt good.

31:14.480 --> 31:18.480
I took that boy on a walk, it felt good.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.200
Feels good.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.040
You know what else feels good?

31:21.040 --> 31:22.480
Entering in a promo code

31:22.480 --> 31:24.560
when checking out on an internet website

31:24.560 --> 31:27.200
and getting it right and getting money

31:27.200 --> 31:28.480
off your purchase for it.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.280
Because here's the thing,

31:29.280 --> 31:30.400
whenever you don't have that code

31:30.400 --> 31:31.200
and you see the field where it's like

31:31.200 --> 31:32.400
punch in a code to save money,

31:32.400 --> 31:34.240
you know if you don't know the code,

31:34.240 --> 31:37.120
someone somewhere is saving money and you're not.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.320
And that's not fair.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.160
But Honey is the great equalizer

31:40.160 --> 31:42.080
because it's a free browser extension

31:42.080 --> 31:45.680
that just finds those fricking codes for you

31:45.680 --> 31:47.440
while you're just shopping like normal.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.440
There's a little button that says apply coupons

31:49.440 --> 31:50.960
and if Honey can find a coupon,

31:50.960 --> 31:52.560
it just beep boop boop boop.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.380
Sunny!

31:54.240 --> 31:55.200
And the prices go down.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.520
They've been advertising with us for a while

31:57.520 --> 31:59.600
and I have now, not an exaggeration,

31:59.600 --> 32:05.440
saved like over $100 using Honey every time I shop.

32:06.480 --> 32:10.480
It is a absolute grand slam fantastic addition

32:10.480 --> 32:13.600
to your web browsing and web shopping experience.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.160
You can get Honey for free at joinhoney.com

32:16.160 --> 32:20.000
slash brother, that's joinhoney, H-O-N-E-Y,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.800
not the stupid way Pooh Bear spells it.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.520
Dot com.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.280
Okay, the way we also spell it,

32:25.280 --> 32:27.040
it's the way we also spell it.

32:27.040 --> 32:27.520
What do you mean?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.960
20honey, that's H-U-N-N-Y.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.080
Oh, is it spelled like that?

32:32.960 --> 32:33.920
For our thing?

32:33.920 --> 32:34.880
I don't like that.

32:34.880 --> 32:40.400
Anyway, go to joinhoney.com slash brother.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.080
It's money, honey.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.060
Nope.

32:44.240 --> 32:44.740
Okay.

32:44.740 --> 32:52.100
Let's see, guest, I want a munch.

32:52.100 --> 32:52.600
Squad.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.300
I want to munch.

32:57.300 --> 32:57.800
Squad.

33:01.220 --> 33:01.940
Welcome to Munch Squad.

33:01.940 --> 33:04.980
It's a podcast within the podcast detailing the latest

33:04.980 --> 33:06.820
and greatest in brand eating.

33:08.180 --> 33:10.900
Rather than go back into the time machine,

33:10.900 --> 33:13.700
I've got a trio of new small munch squad stories

33:13.700 --> 33:14.260
to share with you.

33:14.260 --> 33:14.760
Oh, God.

33:15.380 --> 33:18.660
The first is not thematically tied to the other two,

33:18.660 --> 33:20.020
but I did want to share it with you.

33:20.900 --> 33:22.580
This is about Bang Energy.

33:23.940 --> 33:24.820
About what?

33:24.820 --> 33:25.380
And what's that?

33:25.380 --> 33:26.180
Bang Energy.

33:26.180 --> 33:26.900
It's an energy drink.

33:26.900 --> 33:27.300
Okay.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.260
They got a new flavor.

33:28.260 --> 33:29.940
It's a mouthwatering, ultra delicious.

33:29.940 --> 33:31.780
This is thanks to Katie Bello who sent this in.

33:32.420 --> 33:35.300
Mouthwatering and ultra delicious Radical Skedaddle

33:35.860 --> 33:37.220
by Bang Energy.

33:37.220 --> 33:39.620
The name radical tells the story of this new flavor

33:39.620 --> 33:42.660
is extraordinary while the skedaddle will literally

33:42.660 --> 33:44.020
make your tongue rattle.

33:44.020 --> 33:45.780
After simply skipping radical skedaddle,

33:45.780 --> 33:47.700
you'll feel the vibes of beating drums,

33:47.700 --> 33:50.180
electric guitars and rock music flowing through your brains

33:50.180 --> 33:51.380
and pulsating through your veins.

33:51.380 --> 33:51.880
What?

33:53.060 --> 33:55.460
With the new Rad Scad flavor launch,

33:55.460 --> 33:57.940
rock and roll was the goal and cutting edge nutrition

33:57.940 --> 33:58.900
was the vision.

33:58.900 --> 34:01.700
It's easy as fishing when ambition drives the mission.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.740
Holy shit.

34:02.740 --> 34:05.620
Jack O'Oak, Bang Energy CEO,

34:05.620 --> 34:10.180
who seems to be in my humble amateur opinion.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.980
I have no information about a bad person.

34:12.980 --> 34:13.620
Seems to be a bad person.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.140
Hey, just real quick.

34:16.180 --> 34:19.060
I wanna get a quick poll of the three people on this call.

34:20.900 --> 34:22.420
Do you think Bang Energy doesn't know

34:22.420 --> 34:23.700
what the word skedaddle means?

34:25.380 --> 34:26.580
Yeah, I think that that's fair.

34:26.580 --> 34:27.940
Okay, because they're trying to spin it

34:27.940 --> 34:29.140
like it's like rock and roll.

34:29.700 --> 34:32.980
That's not at all what I get when I see like

34:32.980 --> 34:34.980
maybe a little scamp whose baby-

34:34.980 --> 34:36.260
Skedaddle makes your tongue rattle.

34:36.260 --> 34:36.760
Okay.

34:37.300 --> 34:41.620
Jack also said we don't make people want our products.

34:41.620 --> 34:43.620
Bang Energy makes products people want.

34:43.620 --> 34:44.260
Huh.

34:44.260 --> 34:45.460
Bang, we don't make people-

34:45.460 --> 34:46.180
It's interesting.

34:46.180 --> 34:47.060
Bang, Bang Energy.

34:47.060 --> 34:48.020
Anyway, that was wild.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.860
Maybe that's why I've never heard of Bang Energy.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.060
Okay, meat of the future.

34:53.060 --> 34:57.620
KFC is 3D bioprinting nuggets in Russia.

34:57.620 --> 34:58.120
Good.

34:58.660 --> 34:59.220
Huh.

34:59.220 --> 35:00.820
Just wanna share everybody with that.

35:01.540 --> 35:04.660
It's a 3D meat of the future printing thing.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.300
Project aims to create the world's first

35:07.300 --> 35:09.060
laboratory produced chicken nuggets.

35:09.060 --> 35:10.580
They'll be as close as possible

35:10.580 --> 35:13.220
in both taste and appearance to the original KFC product

35:13.220 --> 35:15.140
while being more environmentally friendly

35:15.140 --> 35:16.660
to produce than the ordinary meat.

35:16.660 --> 35:17.140
Badass.

35:17.140 --> 35:18.820
Receiving a final product for testing

35:18.820 --> 35:22.740
is already being planned for the fall of 2020 in Moscow.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.580
This uses chicken cells and plant matter

35:25.220 --> 35:30.580
to create lab-grown chicken nuggets.

35:30.580 --> 35:34.020
Where do they get the chicken cells?

35:34.020 --> 35:35.620
It doesn't harm chickens.

35:35.620 --> 35:37.300
Chickens, I think, give them freely.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.180
Maybe it's hair.

35:38.180 --> 35:38.660
They have lots of cells.

35:38.660 --> 35:39.300
Maybe it's beard.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.500
They have so many cells.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.860
Maybe it's beard trimmings.

35:42.500 --> 35:46.420
Bio meat has the same micro elements as the original product

35:46.420 --> 35:48.180
while excluding various additives

35:48.180 --> 35:50.820
that are used in traditional farming and animal husbandry,

35:50.820 --> 35:52.900
creating a cleaner final product.

35:53.540 --> 35:55.620
Cell-based meat products are also more ethical.

35:55.620 --> 35:58.500
The production process does not cause any harm to animals.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.820
KFC remains committed to continuous improvement

36:00.820 --> 36:02.180
animal welfare from the farm

36:02.900 --> 36:04.660
through all aspects of our supply chain,

36:04.660 --> 36:08.260
including raising, handling, transportation, processing.

36:08.260 --> 36:12.660
Beheading is not listed there, but I'm assuming that's taken at face value.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.980
At KFC, we're closely monitoring all the latest trends and innovations

36:16.980 --> 36:19.380
that are doing our best to keep up with the times

36:19.380 --> 36:23.300
by introducing advanced technologies to our restaurant networks.

36:23.300 --> 36:26.980
So this is a race by KFC

36:28.660 --> 36:33.220
to produce a more environmentally friendly chicken nugget

36:33.220 --> 36:35.540
so we can all, you know...

36:35.540 --> 36:38.420
Thank you to Caroline, by the way, for sending that one in.

36:39.300 --> 36:42.260
So we can all enjoy, you know, a safer,

36:44.100 --> 36:46.740
more sustainable chicken nugget.

36:46.740 --> 36:47.780
We're working together.

36:47.780 --> 36:51.540
And then to do that, a lot of work and energy is going into it

36:51.540 --> 36:55.460
just to make it, you know, a little less of an impact on the planet.

36:55.460 --> 36:56.260
I think that's cool.

36:56.260 --> 36:57.860
I do think they're missing an opportunity

36:57.860 --> 37:01.620
if they are 3D printing this stuff to make it in a way cooler shape.

37:01.620 --> 37:05.780
Like, for instance, just one very, very, very long rope.

37:06.580 --> 37:07.380
Like a long...

37:07.380 --> 37:09.700
Like a chicken spindle.

37:09.700 --> 37:10.580
I just want to...

37:10.580 --> 37:12.980
I think it's great that they're putting all this effort

37:12.980 --> 37:17.380
into a more sustainable product, more humane product

37:17.380 --> 37:22.020
so we can all eat chicken and, you know, feel a little bit better about it.

37:22.020 --> 37:24.260
There's one more story here I want to share from John.

37:24.900 --> 37:28.420
Central Florida PDQ locations to offer milkshake on Monday

37:28.420 --> 37:29.780
with blended chicken tenders.

37:29.780 --> 37:32.740
Whoa!

37:32.740 --> 37:36.820
On Monday only, guests can order their chicken tender handspun shake

37:36.820 --> 37:39.060
which contains vanilla ice cream

37:39.060 --> 37:41.780
and a whole chicken tender blended up inside of it.

37:41.780 --> 37:46.500
Fucking in Russia, people are racing against the clock

37:46.500 --> 37:48.900
to save our bedraggled planet

37:48.900 --> 37:52.980
by coming up with plant-based 3D printed chicken tenders.

37:52.980 --> 37:56.340
In Florida, they're fucking jamming them into blenders

37:56.340 --> 37:58.980
almost as fast as they can produce them.

37:58.980 --> 38:01.860
This is why we need sustainable chicken tenders

38:01.860 --> 38:06.020
is because PDQ is fucking jamming them into blenders.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.420
I consider myself a pretty with it, dude.

38:11.220 --> 38:13.220
Is this a thing people were asking for?

38:13.220 --> 38:15.620
I've never heard of this.

38:15.620 --> 38:16.980
Like I've never heard of like,

38:16.980 --> 38:18.420
oh man, you like that milkshake?

38:18.420 --> 38:20.740
Well, you haven't really enjoyed it

38:20.740 --> 38:22.740
till you've put a chicken tender in it.

38:22.740 --> 38:24.660
Well, Trev, I'm glad you mentioned that.

38:24.660 --> 38:28.420
PDQ's chief marketing officer said in this article,

38:28.420 --> 38:31.220
our guests love our craveable fresh chicken tenders

38:31.220 --> 38:33.540
and our delicious handspun shakes.

38:33.540 --> 38:36.500
This shake combines the amazing flavors in both.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.060
Oh boy, you motherfucker.

38:39.060 --> 38:41.620
This reporter who gets bonus points,

38:41.620 --> 38:46.180
bonus points to Dave Plotkin for asking the hard questions

38:46.180 --> 38:49.620
is basically like, is it fucking whack?

38:49.620 --> 38:51.300
Because it sounds whack.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.220
It sounds absolutely terrible.

38:53.220 --> 38:58.820
The quote that Dave got back was,

38:58.820 --> 39:01.060
we have heard from our guests

39:01.060 --> 39:03.940
that they love our hand-breaded chicken tenders

39:03.940 --> 39:06.660
and they also love our handspun milkshakes.

39:06.660 --> 39:08.180
So what better combination

39:08.180 --> 39:11.460
to celebrate National Chicken Tender Day?

39:11.460 --> 39:16.500
You mother, just, you can't, it's 3.99.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.320
That's a good deal.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.380
There's gonna be chunks in like,

39:19.380 --> 39:20.900
what are you doing, are you doing straw?

39:20.900 --> 39:23.380
That's the plan, bud.

39:23.380 --> 39:26.340
Yeah, but I, is it a spoon thick?

39:26.340 --> 39:28.900
Oh, there's another chicken tender on top.

39:29.940 --> 39:30.580
Fuck.

39:30.580 --> 39:33.220
Travis, who is this imaginary person

39:33.220 --> 39:36.820
that you have breathed life into the ether

39:36.820 --> 39:38.420
who says, yeah, let me get one of those,

39:40.020 --> 39:43.300
I guess it's gonna be either a hamburger

39:43.300 --> 39:44.980
or the chicken tender milkshake.

39:44.980 --> 39:46.500
You know what, I'll do the chicken tender milkshake

39:46.500 --> 39:47.700
and then gets it back to their table

39:47.700 --> 39:49.140
and takes a big bite and is like,

39:49.140 --> 39:51.460
hey, there's a chunk in this.

39:51.460 --> 39:54.580
No, I'm not sending this chicken tender milkshake back.

39:54.580 --> 39:57.780
No, I'm talking about just consumability, Griffin.

39:57.780 --> 39:59.460
What is the method?

40:00.100 --> 40:01.780
Because this would have to be spoon, right?

40:01.780 --> 40:05.700
Because a chunk of chicken ain't going up a straw.

40:05.700 --> 40:06.980
This is not a straw drink.

40:08.420 --> 40:10.740
I assume it'll be placed at your tomb with you

40:10.740 --> 40:12.340
like an Egyptian pharaoh's cats.

40:13.620 --> 40:17.860
Dave writes, the small size of this monstrosity is 3.99

40:17.860 --> 40:20.660
and the regular size is 5.29.

40:20.660 --> 40:24.260
Now, Justin, was there a little editorializing in there?

40:24.260 --> 40:26.100
No, I'm reading from Dave's story.

40:26.980 --> 40:29.380
It's in orlandoweekly.com, find it.

40:30.100 --> 40:33.220
The small size of this monstrosity is 3.99

40:33.220 --> 40:35.380
and the regular size is 5.29

40:35.380 --> 40:36.500
and there is no large

40:36.500 --> 40:38.900
because there is truly no justice in this world.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.740
Have we heard from Dave before?

40:42.740 --> 40:44.420
I feel like we've heard from Dave before.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.420
It's possible we've heard from Dave before.

40:46.420 --> 40:49.620
I do like, I wish there was a large

40:49.620 --> 40:50.980
because I like the person's like,

40:50.980 --> 40:53.060
I'm going to order this and I'm going to commit.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.260
Why don't you go ahead and put a biscuit

40:56.260 --> 40:58.660
and maybe some like solid sugar packets

40:58.660 --> 40:59.860
or whatever in there too.

40:59.860 --> 41:02.100
Just swirl it all up.

41:02.100 --> 41:03.620
Swirl it all up.

41:03.620 --> 41:04.660
Anyway, that's the much squad.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.420
Sorry to take up so much of your time with it this week

41:06.420 --> 41:08.660
but I just thought that those stories

41:08.660 --> 41:10.580
were a really nice pairing,

41:10.580 --> 41:13.540
almost as nice a pairing as handspun milkshakes

41:13.540 --> 41:14.740
and chicken tenders.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.420
Hey, real quick, can I tell folks at home

41:16.420 --> 41:17.780
about the Max Fun Drive?

41:17.780 --> 41:18.660
Yeah.

41:18.660 --> 41:21.140
Okay, I'm going to speed through this

41:21.140 --> 41:23.380
because I don't want to waste too much of your time, folks.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.820
Right foot in the door.

41:24.820 --> 41:26.580
This is the straight shit.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.100
Here's how it works.

41:28.100 --> 41:30.580
You go to maximumfun.org forward slash join.

41:30.580 --> 41:32.740
You pick a membership level that you're comfortable with.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.260
At $5 a month,

41:34.260 --> 41:37.300

41:37.300 --> 41:38.740
from every Max Fun show

41:38.740 --> 41:41.220
and stretches across all Max Fun Drive.

41:41.220 --> 41:42.500
There's tons of stuff on there.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.540
There's video stuff.

41:43.540 --> 41:44.580
There's audio stuff.

41:44.580 --> 41:46.500
There's stuff you're not going to hear anywhere else.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.260
You get that for just $5 a month.

41:48.260 --> 41:50.500
$10 a month, you get the bonus content.

41:50.500 --> 41:53.220
You get an enamel pin designed by Megan Lencott.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.020
You get to pick it.

41:54.020 --> 41:55.780
There's one for every Max Fun show.

41:55.780 --> 41:56.660
You pick your favorite.

41:56.660 --> 41:57.780
You're going to get that pin

41:57.780 --> 41:59.940
and a membership card that shows you

41:59.940 --> 42:01.940
are a member of the Max Fun family.

42:01.940 --> 42:04.340
For $20 a month, you get the bonus content.

42:04.340 --> 42:05.460
You get the membership card.

42:05.460 --> 42:07.060
You get your pick of the enamel pin

42:07.060 --> 42:09.860
and you get a Max Fun themed game night pack

42:09.860 --> 42:11.700
with like Max Fun themed cards,

42:11.700 --> 42:15.140
a Max Fun themed dice bag and Max Fun themed dice.

42:15.140 --> 42:16.820
There's other levels to pick from as well.

42:17.540 --> 42:18.660
You get to pick yours.

42:18.660 --> 42:20.980
You decide which level you're comfortable with.

42:20.980 --> 42:22.660
Maybe you're already a member

42:22.660 --> 42:25.140
and you have come to depend more and more

42:25.140 --> 42:27.540
on Max Fun shows for entertainment,

42:27.540 --> 42:30.740
education or information or whatever, right?

42:30.740 --> 42:32.740
And you're ready to move up to the next level.

42:32.740 --> 42:36.340
You can do that at maximumfun.org slash manage.

42:36.340 --> 42:39.060
Maybe you are a big fan of Max Fun.

42:39.060 --> 42:40.420
You're already a Max Fun member.

42:40.420 --> 42:42.980
You want to be able to give more to the shows you love,

42:42.980 --> 42:45.940
but you aren't able to move to the next level.

42:45.940 --> 42:48.180
This year, we're offering a new thing called boosting

42:48.180 --> 42:50.900
where you can go to maximumfun.org slash manage

42:50.900 --> 42:53.300
and you're able to give a little bit more

42:53.300 --> 42:55.620
without having to move up to the next level, right?

42:55.620 --> 42:57.860
So you're able to support the art and artists you love

42:57.860 --> 43:00.340
without having to commit to a higher membership level.

43:00.340 --> 43:02.740
Now this won't qualify you for the rewards,

43:02.740 --> 43:04.660
but you'll have the reward of knowing

43:04.660 --> 43:06.820
that you gave more to the art and artists you love.

43:06.820 --> 43:09.860
If you're not able to give it all, we totally understand.

43:09.860 --> 43:12.340
Things are really, really uncertain out there.

43:12.340 --> 43:14.020
And you know, these are scary times.

43:14.020 --> 43:15.540
And if you aren't able to commit yourself

43:15.540 --> 43:17.700
to a monthly payment, we totally get it.

43:17.700 --> 43:20.500
You can still support the shows by sharing the link,

43:20.500 --> 43:23.060
maximumfun.org slash join,

43:23.060 --> 43:25.780
telling people why you love Max Fun shows,

43:25.780 --> 43:27.540
using the hashtag Max Fun Drive,

43:27.540 --> 43:30.340
sharing links to episodes, anything like that.

43:30.340 --> 43:33.780
And really just listening to our shows is a lot of support.

43:33.780 --> 43:35.140
So thank you so much for that.

43:35.940 --> 43:39.140
When you become a member or increase your membership,

43:39.140 --> 43:42.740
30% of what you are able to give goes to Max Fun

43:42.740 --> 43:44.980
to pay their staff, to keep the lights on,

43:44.980 --> 43:47.780
and to fund next year's Max Fun Drive.

43:47.780 --> 43:50.420
The rest goes to the shows you listen to.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.340
When you become a member or upgrade your membership,

43:52.340 --> 43:54.340
they will ask you what shows you listen to,

43:54.340 --> 43:55.860
and that's where your money goes.

43:55.860 --> 43:59.700
So you are directly supporting the art and artists you love.

43:59.700 --> 44:05.380
So one more time, those URLs are maximumfun.org slash join,

44:05.380 --> 44:07.700
and maximumfun.org slash manage.

44:07.700 --> 44:10.020
And if you're thinking about doing either one of those,

44:10.020 --> 44:12.020
we would ask that you go ahead and do it now

44:12.020 --> 44:12.980
before you forget.

44:12.980 --> 44:15.220
And if you're not able to, totally cool.

44:16.340 --> 44:19.140
That was so easy for me.

44:20.340 --> 44:23.060
I didn't have to say or do like anything.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.860
And that's just a service I offer.

44:25.860 --> 44:28.020
It was pretty rad, pretty righteous, and I do like it.

44:28.020 --> 44:28.900
I do appreciate it.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.740
Please go to maximumfun.org slash join.

44:30.740 --> 44:32.340
It would be really cool of you.

44:33.300 --> 44:34.100
Can I do a Yahoo?

44:34.980 --> 44:35.540
Yeah.

44:35.540 --> 44:35.940
Yeah.

44:35.940 --> 44:37.940
This one is sent in by Adrian Calz. Thank you, Adrian.

44:37.940 --> 44:40.820
It's from Yahoo Answers user Britt Britt, who asks,

44:42.420 --> 44:45.780
what is some advice you wish someone would have given you

44:45.780 --> 44:47.860
before starting your own clothing business?

44:48.900 --> 44:51.060
Oh, don't open that chest.

44:51.060 --> 44:51.860
It's cursed.

44:53.540 --> 44:56.820
I don't know how common.

44:58.340 --> 45:01.940
I went into great-grandma-ma's attic to look for clothes-

45:01.940 --> 45:02.580
For your business.

45:02.580 --> 45:05.140
Yeah, to look for clothes that I could sell.

45:05.140 --> 45:07.140
It was a consignment business, and I found-

45:07.140 --> 45:08.580
So you were robbing your grand,

45:08.580 --> 45:09.620
just to start from the beginning.

45:09.620 --> 45:11.140
Oh no, she's super dead.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.460
She's real dead.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.220
Just know what, I've been in the house for a while,

45:15.220 --> 45:17.860
and I was like, I know great-grandma-ma has some old clothes

45:17.860 --> 45:19.860
out there that I could sell for consignment.

45:19.860 --> 45:22.660
And so I went up there looking for clothes,

45:22.660 --> 45:25.540
and I found that old sailor's trunk.

45:25.540 --> 45:28.660
And I said, there's probably some cool old sailor clothes in there.

45:28.660 --> 45:29.460
And I opened it up.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.340
And first let me say,

45:30.340 --> 45:32.660
there were some cool old sailor clothes in there,

45:32.660 --> 45:35.540
but also a scary sailor ghost.

45:35.540 --> 45:37.780
And so I had to contend with that for a while.

45:37.780 --> 45:40.100
And eventually, the only way I could get him to leave me alone

45:40.100 --> 45:42.100
is I had to make him a silent partner in the business.

45:42.100 --> 45:44.740
And now he gets 50% of every t-shirt I sell.

45:45.380 --> 45:47.620
And that's really draining my profits, frankly.

45:47.620 --> 45:51.060
And my overhead is over my head, if you know what I mean.

45:52.020 --> 45:53.620
Did you think about putting him back in the trunk

45:53.620 --> 45:55.060
and dropping the trunk into the deep-

45:55.060 --> 45:55.700
I tried.

45:55.700 --> 45:56.980
... into the ocean, no?

45:56.980 --> 46:00.820
I tried, but it showed right back up in my living room.

46:00.820 --> 46:03.380
And then I burned it, and it was right back there.

46:03.380 --> 46:05.860
And I gave it to a friend, and it was right back there.

46:07.060 --> 46:09.220
And the only way I could get him to go away

46:09.220 --> 46:12.020
is the 50-50 partnership.

46:12.020 --> 46:12.520
Right.

46:13.380 --> 46:15.860
And the worst part is sometimes he does show up at the shop,

46:15.860 --> 46:18.260
and he tries to make interior decorating decisions.

46:18.260 --> 46:20.500
And he's like, I think that the pants rack

46:20.500 --> 46:21.620
would do better over there.

46:21.620 --> 46:24.420
And I'm like, fuck, Stuart, get out of here.

46:24.420 --> 46:25.460
He does have a good point.

46:26.580 --> 46:28.660
Listen, I know, but at that point, it's a thing.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.340
You know, I don't want to give in to him,

46:30.340 --> 46:33.060
because then it's going to make him feel entitled to come back.

46:33.060 --> 46:35.300
And he kind of bosses my employees around,

46:35.300 --> 46:36.980
and I don't care for it.

46:36.980 --> 46:38.980
I think that I wish somebody would have stopped me

46:38.980 --> 46:40.820
before I cut holes in the back of all the pants

46:40.820 --> 46:42.420
to make little holes that people could poop through

46:42.420 --> 46:44.660
so they don't have to pull their pants down in the toilet.

46:44.660 --> 46:46.180
But those were a hit for a while.

46:46.900 --> 46:48.340
For a while, but then it-

46:48.980 --> 46:51.780
I was psyched, Travis, the week that people started to post

46:51.780 --> 46:52.980
about that on TikTok.

46:52.980 --> 46:54.900
And they're like, you've got to get these butthole pants.

46:54.900 --> 46:57.620
And I was like, yes, I've made it.

46:57.620 --> 46:59.780
But then the following week, nobody came in,

46:59.780 --> 47:02.420
and I realized I was just sort of a novelty to them.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.100
What do you think changed?

47:04.100 --> 47:07.220
The pants, well, I guess they thought it was a joke,

47:08.500 --> 47:10.660
but jokes don't stay funny for very long.

47:10.660 --> 47:13.460
And then it was not even a practical thing

47:13.460 --> 47:16.100
that people wanted.

47:16.100 --> 47:19.460
So then I put patches on them, but the patches-

47:19.460 --> 47:20.580
Just regular bad pants?

47:20.580 --> 47:22.580
Now there's just bad pants with a patch on the back.

47:23.620 --> 47:25.860
I wish jokes stayed funny for longer

47:25.860 --> 47:28.580
so we didn't have to do this every week.

47:28.580 --> 47:30.340
Can you imagine how nice it would be

47:30.340 --> 47:31.540
if we could just say like,

47:31.540 --> 47:33.700
no, those other jokes are still funny.

47:33.700 --> 47:34.500
Yeah, those are the jokes.

47:35.140 --> 47:36.180
Go back and listen to them.

47:36.180 --> 47:37.780
They're still actually pretty funny.

47:37.780 --> 47:39.380
They're just a week old jokes.

47:39.380 --> 47:40.580
It's still pretty funny.

47:40.580 --> 47:41.540
Go back and listen to those again.

47:41.540 --> 47:42.580
I bet there are people on Earth

47:42.580 --> 47:43.620
who still haven't even heard them.

47:44.340 --> 47:45.060
That's possible.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.060
They're funny to them sharing their laughter.

47:47.620 --> 47:48.740
You know what I mean?

47:48.740 --> 47:49.540
What about you, Justin?

47:49.540 --> 47:51.140
What's something you wish that someone had told you

47:51.140 --> 47:52.740
before you opened your clothing business?

47:52.740 --> 47:54.580
That, hold on.

47:54.580 --> 47:55.080
Uh-huh.

47:55.860 --> 47:57.620
We've already done cursed pirate chest

47:57.620 --> 47:59.460
and we did butthole cutouts.

48:03.460 --> 48:04.180
You can do this.

48:04.180 --> 48:07.540
I tried to get the multi-scarf thing going.

48:07.540 --> 48:11.140
It was one scarf, but I pre-knitted them together

48:11.140 --> 48:13.700
to get that Johnny Depp, Steven Tyler look.

48:13.700 --> 48:14.200
Uh-huh.

48:14.820 --> 48:17.780
I did not appreciate three things.

48:17.780 --> 48:18.280
Okay.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.980
One, that look.

48:20.980 --> 48:25.620
One, that look would become unfavorable

48:25.620 --> 48:28.260
much quicker than anyone could have possibly imagined.

48:28.980 --> 48:33.940
Two, people like to mix and match their various scarves

48:33.940 --> 48:37.380
to create a new multi-scarf look every day.

48:37.380 --> 48:39.860
It's an expression of their own personality.

48:39.860 --> 48:42.500
I should have appreciated that and I didn't.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.980
Now, the third thing is crumbs.

48:45.700 --> 48:49.140
You know, you have separate scarves.

48:49.140 --> 48:53.140
You enjoy a Long John Silver's chicken tender meal,

48:53.140 --> 48:54.740
three pieces, two pieces.

48:54.740 --> 48:55.540
It doesn't matter.

48:56.180 --> 48:57.940
You start getting crumbs in there.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.420
If the scarf is all stitched together,

49:00.420 --> 49:02.660
if it's several scarves that have been merged,

49:03.780 --> 49:04.340
that's the problem.

49:04.340 --> 49:05.060
Now, you got birds.

49:05.780 --> 49:07.780
Now, you have a bird problem.

49:07.780 --> 49:09.620
That's what happened to Brenda Fricker.

49:09.620 --> 49:12.820
Everybody knows she had one of my multi-scarves.

49:12.820 --> 49:13.540
She ate the chicken.

49:14.820 --> 49:17.140
Yeah, the pigeons won't leave her alone.

49:17.140 --> 49:18.020
You get the fries in there.

49:18.020 --> 49:19.540
You get some of those crumblies, you know,

49:19.540 --> 49:21.540
where they've just fried the fat,

49:21.540 --> 49:24.260
like just to put some batter in there, you know?

49:24.260 --> 49:25.780
And the birds love the batter.

49:25.780 --> 49:28.340
They eat batter up and then they will pick you up

49:28.340 --> 49:29.540
and fly you away.

49:29.540 --> 49:30.900
I wish somebody also had told me

49:30.900 --> 49:33.860
that there already was a store called Lids.

49:34.500 --> 49:34.740
Yeah.

49:34.740 --> 49:35.460
Because I'm open.

49:35.460 --> 49:38.180
I paid all that money for a store at the mall called Lids.

49:38.820 --> 49:41.060
And then I made all my shirts that says,

49:41.060 --> 49:42.900
like, I'm a happy Lids employee

49:42.900 --> 49:44.340
that I made all the employees wear.

49:44.340 --> 49:50.740
And then I got a very terse email from the Lids owners

49:50.740 --> 49:51.620
of the real Lids.

49:51.620 --> 49:53.860
And they said, hey, you can't do that.

49:53.860 --> 49:56.740
And so I said, what else am I supposed to call it?

49:56.740 --> 49:58.420
What else am I supposed to call my shoe store?

49:58.420 --> 49:59.700
And they're like, you're what?

49:59.700 --> 50:02.020
And I was like, yeah, dummy.

50:02.020 --> 50:03.860
They're Lids for your feet.

50:04.660 --> 50:06.900
And then Griffin took the war to them.

50:06.900 --> 50:07.400
Yeah.

50:08.500 --> 50:09.700
You'll probably write about it in the paper,

50:09.700 --> 50:14.580
but Griffin went to the Lids when the store was empty

50:14.580 --> 50:16.900
and he threw a Molotov cocktail in there,

50:16.900 --> 50:19.220
except he messed it up and he didn't do it right.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.340
And there was somebody in there,

50:21.140 --> 50:23.220
but he didn't do the fire part right either.

50:23.220 --> 50:25.700
So it was just a broken pot on the floor.

50:25.700 --> 50:26.660
And it was just soda.

50:26.660 --> 50:28.500
It was just a bunch of cola.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.180
They made him come back and clean it up.

50:31.060 --> 50:33.380
And then they said, you did such a good job cleaning.

50:33.380 --> 50:34.500
Do you want a job here?

50:34.500 --> 50:36.260
And now Griffin works at Lids.

50:36.260 --> 50:36.580
Yeah.

50:36.580 --> 50:39.300
Well, no, he works at Lids in the mornings

50:39.300 --> 50:40.660
and then Lids in the evenings.

50:40.660 --> 50:43.140
Oh, I did have to change the name of my store

50:43.140 --> 50:44.980
and I did change it to Feet Lockers

50:44.980 --> 50:47.460
because it's like little prisons for your feet.

50:47.460 --> 50:49.780
I also decided like you're locking them up, you know?

50:49.780 --> 50:50.980
You know what I wish I'd known

50:50.980 --> 50:52.900
before I started my clothing business?

50:52.900 --> 50:55.620
I wish I'd known that people liked airbrush shirts

50:55.620 --> 50:58.180
made to order because I just made a whole bunch of them

50:58.180 --> 51:01.620
ahead of time that said like Deborah and Tommy

51:01.620 --> 51:02.740
together forever.

51:02.740 --> 51:06.580
And it just said that one thing, like a bunch, like a lot.

51:06.580 --> 51:09.620
I made like 600 shirts that just said Deborah and Tommy

51:09.620 --> 51:10.500
together forever.

51:10.500 --> 51:14.980
And it was T, it was the letter T and then the letter two

51:14.980 --> 51:17.620
and then gather and then it said F

51:17.620 --> 51:20.100
and then the number four and then ever.

51:20.100 --> 51:22.660
And people pointed out that that looked like together

51:22.660 --> 51:23.940
and for forever.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.620
Yeah, it wasn't good.

51:25.620 --> 51:27.460
I didn't even think about that.

51:27.460 --> 51:30.740
Well, and also I don't know anyone named Debbie or Tommy

51:30.740 --> 51:32.500
and I don't even know if they're together.

51:32.500 --> 51:35.220
Yeah, you were able to salvage a little bit of that though

51:35.220 --> 51:36.980
when you scratched out everything except Deborah

51:36.980 --> 51:40.420
and you did put in a sort of crude caricature of Ray Romano

51:40.420 --> 51:42.980
and you did add like eight more A's on the end of Deborah.

51:42.980 --> 51:44.580
And that's why I made my first million.

51:44.580 --> 51:45.780
Hey guys, hey gang, hey fam,

51:45.780 --> 51:47.460
I would wear the fuck out of that shirt.

51:48.020 --> 51:50.660
Picture of a caricature, fucking Ray Romano

51:50.660 --> 51:53.620
and it just says Deborah on top of it.

51:53.620 --> 51:55.220
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

51:55.220 --> 51:56.260
Lock that up.

51:56.260 --> 51:58.020
Man, but here I go again.

51:58.020 --> 51:59.060
Fucking lids too.

51:59.060 --> 52:00.740
You can't just do that.

52:00.740 --> 52:05.540
Isn't it weird how the Calvin peeing on stuff took off

52:05.540 --> 52:08.980
but Ray Romano screaming Deborah never became

52:08.980 --> 52:10.820
like a thing you saw in the back of trucks

52:10.820 --> 52:12.420
and like ski news and stuff.

52:13.300 --> 52:17.140
Or all the ones of Ray Romano very realistically

52:17.140 --> 52:21.140
like photo realistic peeing and you see it from the front.

52:21.140 --> 52:22.740
So it's like coming at you.

52:22.740 --> 52:25.380
Yeah, or Ray Romano kneeling down before the cross.

52:26.260 --> 52:28.020
Ray Romano peeing on Peter Boyle.

52:28.020 --> 52:30.820
I wish that I have-

52:30.820 --> 52:32.740
Ray Romano kneeling at his wife's grave

52:32.740 --> 52:34.580
just saying Deborah, but in a sad way.

52:34.580 --> 52:35.460
Yeah.

52:35.460 --> 52:36.340
Deborah, period.

52:36.340 --> 52:37.860
He's in love with Deborah.

52:39.540 --> 52:41.540
I wish, I wish.

52:43.860 --> 52:46.020
What about the ones where there's like a bunch of E's

52:46.020 --> 52:47.140
instead of a bunch of A's?

52:47.140 --> 52:50.820
So he's just saying, Deborah.

52:50.820 --> 52:51.860
Deeb.

52:51.860 --> 52:55.700
I wish before I made my unlicensed Pickle Rick hot pants

52:55.700 --> 52:58.820
that I had Googled what that character looked like.

52:58.820 --> 53:01.700
It has a face, that's number one

53:01.700 --> 53:03.300
that I should have accounted for.

53:03.300 --> 53:05.060
Because right now I have a lot of shorts

53:05.700 --> 53:09.300
with Pickles with hands and feet and no face.

53:09.300 --> 53:10.580
And I can't convince people

53:10.580 --> 53:12.100
that they're this Pickle Rick they're all about.

53:12.100 --> 53:14.580
And also, Justin, you did kind of lay the letters out

53:14.580 --> 53:18.020
in the back so that a lot of them went into the butt crack.

53:18.020 --> 53:20.260
So when people wear it, it just looks like it says Pickick.

53:20.980 --> 53:21.700
Yeah, it's not good.

53:21.700 --> 53:22.820
That's not great.

53:22.820 --> 53:24.020
I really wish somebody would have told me

53:24.020 --> 53:26.820
to check the carning when I did establish Griffin's tank top

53:26.820 --> 53:28.740
so that it didn't look like I was trying to sell

53:28.740 --> 53:32.180
Griffin stank tops because those went over

53:32.180 --> 53:33.780
like a real lead balloon.

53:33.780 --> 53:37.140
I just wish people had told me how litigious Ray Romano was

53:37.140 --> 53:39.540
before I did all this branded content.

53:39.540 --> 53:42.980
Yeah, it's really important to him

53:42.980 --> 53:46.260
that people thinks his penis and wiener looks a certain way

53:46.260 --> 53:48.420
and they don't like it when you make a sticker of him.

53:49.060 --> 53:52.340
He also said he wanted to decide when Deborah died and how.

53:52.340 --> 53:53.140
Yeah.

53:53.140 --> 53:55.540
That wasn't really important to him for the character.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.500
If they ever get to make another season

53:58.500 --> 53:59.620
of Everybody Loves Raymond,

53:59.620 --> 54:02.500
most of it is going to be about how Deborah dies

54:02.500 --> 54:05.140
and how the character of Ray reacts to it.

54:06.420 --> 54:08.500
And let me tell you, he let me in on it.

54:08.500 --> 54:09.620
It's gruesome.

54:10.260 --> 54:13.380
Yeah, that sort of Damocles has been swinging over

54:13.380 --> 54:15.700
Patricia Heaton's head for some time now.

54:15.700 --> 54:19.940
And it's probably why she turned out the way she did.

54:19.940 --> 54:22.420
Well, Ray told me that he was kind of envisioning

54:22.420 --> 54:25.460
a spinoff series in which Ray became a mentalist like

54:26.740 --> 54:28.820
crime solver and there needed to be something

54:28.820 --> 54:30.180
that fueled him into that.

54:30.180 --> 54:35.700
And it did involve Deborah's gruesome, gruesome.

54:35.700 --> 54:40.660
What if instead the series, he had been the lead suspect

54:40.660 --> 54:42.500
and he had to find the person that did it

54:42.500 --> 54:44.020
and it was called Everybody Hunts Raymond.

54:44.020 --> 54:47.620
It's just all the different government agencies

54:47.620 --> 54:50.260
working together to bring down Raymond.

54:50.260 --> 54:51.460
You're a police officer.

54:51.460 --> 54:52.660
Tell us where your brother is.

54:54.820 --> 54:58.820
Yeah, it's led by his brother for reasons that are clear

54:58.820 --> 55:02.260
and by his stepfather for reasons that are not.

55:02.260 --> 55:03.700
Everybody loves Raymond's blood

55:03.700 --> 55:05.460
because within it lies the pathogen

55:05.460 --> 55:07.940
that will cure the world's ills.

55:11.140 --> 55:16.260
A bearded outdoorsman, Joel, has to lead his charge.

55:16.260 --> 55:19.460
Ray Romano through a zombie-infested wasteland

55:19.460 --> 55:23.860
because Ray Romano's blood may be the only hope

55:23.860 --> 55:27.780
humanity has for creating a vaccine to the zombie blood.

55:27.780 --> 55:29.700
And then I heard that in the fourth season

55:29.700 --> 55:32.020
of Everybody Loves Raymond, it was basically gonna be like

55:32.020 --> 55:33.700
no one had been pregnant for a long time

55:33.700 --> 55:35.700
but now Ray Romano was pregnant

55:35.700 --> 55:37.620
and they were gonna call it Children of Ray.

55:37.620 --> 55:41.060
And then it just seemed like he was just kind of doing

55:41.700 --> 55:43.940
what different like post-apocalyptic things.

55:43.940 --> 55:46.180
There was one where it was called Ray Box,

55:46.180 --> 55:47.620
where it's like, Ray's in that box.

55:47.620 --> 55:48.500
Don't look in that box.

55:48.500 --> 55:50.820
Did you see 28 Ray's later?

55:55.780 --> 55:57.300
Thank you so much for listening.

55:57.300 --> 55:58.500
The Walking Deb.

55:58.500 --> 55:59.860
Wait, the Walking Deb.

55:59.860 --> 56:01.300
Wait, wait, wait.

56:01.300 --> 56:02.660
Travis bursts into the door.

56:02.660 --> 56:05.060
Wait, you can't lock me out.

56:05.060 --> 56:06.820
The Walking Deb reopened.

56:06.820 --> 56:08.420
What about the day after Romano?

56:09.780 --> 56:11.220
Yeah, absolutely.

56:12.900 --> 56:13.780
Absolutely.

56:13.780 --> 56:15.860
Okay, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

56:15.860 --> 56:16.980
We very much appreciate it.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.500
One more quick pitch.

56:18.500 --> 56:19.620
The Max Fund Drive is-

56:19.620 --> 56:21.540
For another Ray Romano show.

56:21.540 --> 56:23.860
For another Ray Romano show that I just came up with.

56:25.140 --> 56:26.820
That is gonna do it for us.

56:27.460 --> 56:29.380
But the Max Fund Drive will keep on going

56:29.380 --> 56:30.420
for a little bit longer.

56:30.420 --> 56:31.380
You're running out of time though

56:31.380 --> 56:32.500
to support the shows that you love.

56:32.500 --> 56:34.900
Maximumfund.org forward slash join

56:34.900 --> 56:36.260
is the address to do that.

56:36.260 --> 56:40.580
Remember, a $5 pledge gets you all the bonus content,

56:40.580 --> 56:41.620
which is great.

56:41.620 --> 56:46.740
$10 pledge, you get the enamel pin

56:47.300 --> 56:49.300
from whatever show that you choose.

56:49.300 --> 56:51.460
At $20 a month, if you can pledge that,

56:51.460 --> 56:52.900
gosh, we appreciate that.

56:52.900 --> 56:55.620
And we're gonna send you a Max Fund game pack

56:55.620 --> 56:57.620
with like dice and cards and stuff like that.

56:57.620 --> 57:00.100
Plus the pin and the bonus content.

57:00.100 --> 57:02.980
There's a beautiful camp mug at $35 a month.

57:04.580 --> 57:07.060
There's just a lot of great stuff.

57:07.060 --> 57:10.500
But the real thing is supporting the shows that you love.

57:10.500 --> 57:14.260
And if you can do it, we know it's a weird time,

57:14.260 --> 57:15.380
but if you can do that,

57:15.380 --> 57:18.100
it really would mean the world to us.

57:40.820 --> 57:42.580
an album that makes my life possible

57:42.580 --> 57:44.660
