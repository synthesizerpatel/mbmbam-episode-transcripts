00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.520
Hey everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the modern

00:49.520 --> 01:01.520
Scarra, and that means we go from goofs to spooks here on the show. No more jokes to be found,

01:01.520 --> 01:06.320
only pokes at your grave. That's too scary, actually.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.360
In fact, that's not even scary. We're going to murder you.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.960
Yeah, it's not scary as much as it is like modeling and threatening.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.080
I don't want to be modeling or threatening. I want to be Frankenstein,

01:16.080 --> 01:20.800
whatever Frankenstein is. That's kind of scary. Hi, I'm your oldest brother, Frankenstein.

01:20.800 --> 01:27.840
I'm your smallest brother, the Wolfman. I'm your baby brother, Osama bin Laden.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.760
He's a pretty scary guy, though, I bet. He had a run, for certain.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.200
Have you ever noticed that the Wolfman's never on the FBI's most wanted list?

01:37.840 --> 01:42.560
Why are we doing more to stop the Wolfman? Can't stop people from breaking into the White House.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.800
Maybe we could redirect our efforts. The White House, that's a lost cause. We can't worry about

01:46.800 --> 01:52.960
that anymore. But what we can stop is Wolfman. We need to start a Wolfman program where they

01:52.960 --> 01:57.840
can turn themselves in on the 29 other days and get amnesty and be locked in some kind of silver cage.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.560
What if you saw a Wolfman and you were like,

02:00.560 --> 02:04.880
hey, Wolfman's got nards. And he was like, I have a vasectomy. How dare you?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.280
I'm a person.

02:07.280 --> 02:12.640
A vasectomy doesn't... Oh, Justin, I have so many things to tell you about vasectomies, brother.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.720
They don't just get all that stuff out of there.

02:16.720 --> 02:23.280
First, before you start getting all fucking patronizing, tell me how much you know about

02:23.280 --> 02:28.240
Wolfman anatomy, specifically genitalia, before you start trying to contradict my goof.

02:28.880 --> 02:35.440
I can tell you I know a lot about human dicks and I know a lot about wolf dicks.

02:35.440 --> 02:39.120
So I'm just going to conflate those two knowledge bases.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.640
The fucking classic example of dealing with the Wolfman.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.120
I bet that's what the mistake everybody makes is thinking he's half wolf and half man.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.400
He's something else entirely.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.080
And his nards are on his shoulder.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.520
And his nards are on his shoulder.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.640
It's not. Monster camp has established that that is not the truth.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.080
Monster camp, monster team.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.440
Monster friends.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.080
Monster squad.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.680
Super fun monster weekend.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.480
Ass.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.920
Weekend at Monsters.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.520
Why don't we have any jokes? I took that seriously, huh?

03:05.520 --> 03:07.680
And I said that we weren't going to do goofs anymore.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.400
I guess I was being fucking a little bit of grain of truth there with no jokes.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.520
No nothing funny.

03:13.520 --> 03:17.680
You know, the problem is we're recording on a Monday and I have a case of them.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.080
There was one.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.440
There was one right there, Justin.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.800
See, don't sell ourselves short.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.400
You got one out.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.040
That's one and it took us five minutes to get there.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.400
So if we keep that up, we're going to have like 12 or 13 goofs in this episode.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.320
And that's, I think that's pretty much on par.

03:34.240 --> 03:39.120
Let's just get into the advice and hopefully our dear listeners will rescue us from the

03:39.120 --> 03:43.040
I'm going to go ahead and say a very spooky slump that we find ourselves in.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.680
Ooh, we can't think of jokes.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.680
Ooh, your favorite podcast isn't as funny as it used to be.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.120
I miss bramble pelt.

03:53.120 --> 03:53.680
I get it.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.880
We fucking get it, okay?

03:54.880 --> 03:56.800
People, do a horse thing.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.800
We're not fucking clowns.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.720
We're not your fucking organ grinder monkeys.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.280
We're human beings with real life responsibilities.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.920
Sometimes, much like Tim and Eric, we want to pretend we were intentionally unfunny.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.480
Exactly.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.520
Can't you just give us that?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.840
Once a year, maybe?

04:13.840 --> 04:14.480
Once?

04:14.480 --> 04:15.920
Like 12 times a year.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.080
I know a guy who's very clearly crushing on me.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.120
I've told him I'm not interested in dating him.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.240
Twice, actually.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.360
But I think he forgot the first time.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.480
No, he didn't.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.200
He didn't.

04:25.200 --> 04:30.080
I would like to remain friends with him because despite him not being the sharpest pin in

04:30.080 --> 04:31.680
the cushion, he's fun to be around.

04:32.240 --> 04:37.280
So how can I get this through to this guy that I, as a chick who is not into dudes,

04:38.080 --> 04:40.080
will never want to date him?

04:40.080 --> 04:44.240
How is he fucking this up this hard?

04:44.240 --> 04:47.040
Hey, it's the biggest fuck up you can do.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.000
Remind me real quick.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.640
What did you say when I asked you out last time?

04:50.640 --> 04:51.760
Was it a yes or a no?

04:51.760 --> 04:52.640
Was it a yes or no?

04:52.640 --> 04:53.760
Are we dating now?

04:53.760 --> 04:54.800
Because I can't remember.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.360
Let me look at my Facebook.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.560
Was it a yes or a no or I'm a lesbian?

04:58.560 --> 04:59.680
Which of those was it?

04:59.680 --> 05:01.600
Was it like 100% no?

05:01.600 --> 05:02.720
Okay, cool.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.440
Great, great, great.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.960
I'll ask you again in like a week.

05:04.960 --> 05:05.520
It's hard.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.400
Like it's fucking hard.

05:06.400 --> 05:12.960
Like I try not to cast aspersions on people that I know two sentences about, but it's

05:12.960 --> 05:18.640
like this doesn't sound like a person that like wants to be your friend if they don't

05:18.640 --> 05:20.880
if they don't take no as an answer.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.800
And then they also don't take I'm a lesbian as an answer.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.800
I don't I don't care how fun you are to be around if you're going to backseat drive

05:28.800 --> 05:30.240
on my sexual identity.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.960
I prefer you just get out of the car.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.640
I always take I'm a lesbian for an answer no matter what the question is.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.120
No matter what the question is, you can say that shit on Jeopardy.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.560
What is I'm a lesbian?

05:40.560 --> 05:43.200
And then you trip X like yup, got it again.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.840
God, you're doing really great, Ken Jennings.

05:45.840 --> 05:52.880
And for a thousand dollars, the answer is I'm just going to take some time away from

05:52.880 --> 05:53.600
you right now.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.440
The question is, I'm a lesbian.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.960
That is what is it?

05:57.600 --> 06:00.400
Is it it's like when women like other women, Alex, correct?

06:00.400 --> 06:02.240
Why don't you know this?

06:02.240 --> 06:03.680
How do you know everything in the world?

06:03.680 --> 06:05.680
But not the blind spot.

06:05.680 --> 06:06.160
Weird.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.000
You're like a super smart.

06:08.000 --> 06:17.840
Anyway, I don't think that somebody is I think it like not a joke if he's not on board with

06:17.840 --> 06:20.560
like your sexual preference.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.480
I don't think you guys are friends.

06:22.480 --> 06:27.520
I don't think this is like a question of him picking up the clues or picking up the hints

06:27.520 --> 06:28.400
or getting it.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.440
I don't think it's that he's not the sharpest pin in the cushion, as you say.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.560
I think it's that he's just like, no, I'm going to change your mind.

06:34.560 --> 06:38.000
And like, you don't want to be friends with that person regardless.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.120
There's nothing worse than that.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.080
It's hard.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.680
It's hard because like we are we have long been in the camp of like, if you have feelings

06:43.680 --> 06:45.120
for somebody, tell them.

06:45.120 --> 06:49.120
And it's hard to like reconcile that with like, tell them just the once.

06:49.920 --> 06:56.720
And then if it's not if it's a no go because they don't prefer then fucking don't keep

06:56.720 --> 06:57.680
doing it.

06:57.680 --> 07:01.440
Then we need to rephrase it and say like, just tell her, dummy, and then listen.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.560
And then listen so careful.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.280
Oh, man.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.360
Listen so good to the next part.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.800
It's vital information.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.280
If you're to have a next step, your next step is going to be determined by the next things

07:15.280 --> 07:15.840
that are said.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.520
And you should be on board with that.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.280
Otherwise, you're just like watching her mouth move.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.800
But in your head thing, like, I did it.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.240
I asked her, oh, gosh, she's speaking.

07:22.240 --> 07:22.960
I haven't been listening.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.440
Oh, shit.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.160
Did she say yes?

07:24.880 --> 07:26.080
Did she say thespian?

07:26.880 --> 07:27.120
Okay.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.600
Actor, no actor.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.000
That's all right.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I'll bring whatever bacon while you audition.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.000
What a shit show.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.320
Yeah, I don't like this at all.

07:36.320 --> 07:41.200
This is this is I just don't think this person's worth spending time with anymore.

07:41.200 --> 07:45.440
Here's what here's the argument that I would make as to that without again.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.800
We don't know this cat.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.280
Maybe he is a sweetheart.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.960
But picking up on context clues, this is the painting that I'm getting right now.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.160
This is someone who's asked you out.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.560
And not only did he not take no for an answer.

07:56.560 --> 08:03.600
He actually like is in denial about who you are as a person in the hopes that you will

08:03.600 --> 08:10.320
change your mind about a lot of things and not just his fucking broken down personality.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.160
And look, his whole situation.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.120
I think he is just in it because he wants to date you.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.360
I'm not sure somebody like that wants to be your friend.

08:18.720 --> 08:24.960
It's such an uncomfortable thing for both parties and like it's uncomfortable the first

08:24.960 --> 08:27.760
time and that's why people are afraid to do it.

08:27.760 --> 08:33.360
To keep doing it, to keep subjecting you to that discomfort is like is weirdly cruel.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.640
To himself, right?

08:36.640 --> 08:39.600
To himself, to you, it's it's uncomfortable for everyone.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.720
It's uncomfortable for me and I don't even fucking know your real name.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.520
It's uncomfortable for our listeners who have been subjected to this third hand.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.840
There are 30 million people who are uncomfortable now.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.120
We have 30 million listeners.

08:52.560 --> 08:53.680
I don't want to be uncomfortable anymore.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.040
We're basically the Big Bang Theory.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.120
Bazoon Joes.

08:59.120 --> 08:59.920
Bazooka Joes.

08:59.920 --> 09:00.800
Bazooka Joch.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.960
Hey, here's a Yahoo.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.160
It's sent in by Rachel Sperling.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.040
Thank you, Rachel.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nina.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.760
It's in the pregnancy and parenting newborn baby section.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.320
So Justin.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.680
I should be able to feel this one.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.180
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.440
Nina asks, why does my baby have forehead lines?

09:18.720 --> 09:22.320
I just have my son a week ago and he was born with lines on his forehead.

09:22.320 --> 09:26.160
The kind of older people get from raising their eyebrows too much,

09:26.160 --> 09:27.600
worrying and stuff like that.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.440
Well, why does my baby have them?

09:29.440 --> 09:32.400
I have never before seen or heard of babies having them.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.040
Is it normal?

09:33.040 --> 09:37.840
I keep convincing myself that it's my fault because I literally stressed every day while

09:37.840 --> 09:38.720
I was pregnant.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.000
I know only time can tell, but do you think he'll always have these lines or is there

09:42.000 --> 09:43.600
a chance they'll go away as he gets older?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.560
Again, he had them right when he came out of me.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.960
The world's scowliest baby.

09:50.960 --> 09:59.280
I think that I've never heard of a baby with worry lines, but based on the information

09:59.280 --> 10:05.440
provided to me in this Yahoo Answer, I do think this baby has cause for concern.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.200
RE, his parental situation.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.160
I think that he may have some room to worry.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.080
Well, I think the most worrying thing of this whole situation is that this woman doesn't

10:18.080 --> 10:21.440
know the word wrinkles.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.160
You know, like those lines, like old people get them, you know.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.240
Like skin creases, shit.

10:26.240 --> 10:31.280
You know, it's like when the skin kind of like together, you know, it's like a butt

10:31.280 --> 10:32.240
crack on their face.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.680
You know, you know.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.280
Oh boy, I have never seen a baby.

10:37.280 --> 10:41.600
I would be distressed if I worked really hard to have a baby.

10:41.600 --> 10:47.600
Well, my wife would, but then that baby came out and looked like fucking William Daniels.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.360
I would be heartbroken.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.040
I wanted a new human being.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.920
And this human being looks like William Daniels mustache and all.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.640
Maybe that's it.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.480
Maybe like there's a like knowing soul trapped inside the baby who can't communicate because

10:58.480 --> 10:59.280
it's a baby.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.640
And like all they can do is like scowl and furrow their brow and try to figure out a

11:02.640 --> 11:03.360
way out of this.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.520
Oh my God, is it a Benjamin Button?

11:08.560 --> 11:10.160
Is this the first?

11:10.160 --> 11:15.120
You got old man baby, the first evidence, the first Benjamin Button in the wild.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.840
The baby was born with wrinkles and tattoos and piercings and glasses.

11:20.800 --> 11:21.760
It was bilingual.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.080
I haven't seen the movie.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.640
What is the return policy here on the baby?

11:28.640 --> 11:30.960
Oh, I can feel this one ain't got none.

11:31.920 --> 11:36.640
She would think you would think that they would have some sort of like right now.

11:37.200 --> 11:42.160
My baby has hair on the top of her head and then the rest of her hair is sort of sliding

11:42.160 --> 11:47.120
down a reverse bald spot like kind of a Wallace Shawn thing going on.

11:47.120 --> 11:51.600
I'm like, oh boy, what is I'm checking for warranties, looking for the receipts.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.640
I don't have any receipts.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.080
I have a social security number.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.760
Oops, mine for good.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.240
Can you trade her out with one of those like spare babies?

11:59.920 --> 12:00.420
Spare.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.680
No, actually, they do not include burner babies with your baby.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.800
It's really just the.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.040
Yeah.

12:05.040 --> 12:11.120
So Cabal Cabal, I didn't have a have a baby, give a baby, need a baby, take a baby system

12:11.120 --> 12:11.840
going on.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.360
Just like a tray, like a little bowl on the front desk, just a little ball there on the

12:15.360 --> 12:17.920
front desk next to the peppermint swirls.

12:18.560 --> 12:23.360
They apparently used to have one, but now they have these bracelets on their legs that

12:23.360 --> 12:26.400
beep when you try to participate in that particular program.

12:29.120 --> 12:29.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.880
I thought this was my baby.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.880
I guess I did bring a watermelon wrapped in a blanket that I was gonna.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.080
But that was for eating.

12:38.080 --> 12:45.440
I promise I I have to assume that babies when they are born because they don't have like

12:45.440 --> 12:51.920
shit like, you know, marrow or that stuff that connects your bones.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.400
And so I imagine that babies are like the most pliable you are as a human being.

12:58.400 --> 13:02.400
So you could probably nip tuck that stuff pretty easy and just sort of chop.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.280
Yeah, you just get a chip clip, pull the skin back.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.400
You just chip clip it and then it should clip your baby.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.440
Just chip clip it.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.920
All I'm saying is that if much of society thinks is permissible to cut the tip of a

13:13.920 --> 13:14.800
baby's wiener off.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.520
Yep, because it won't remember.

13:17.520 --> 13:24.080
This seems like a perfect time for it to go under the knife to get a tuck, a nip tuck.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.600
So face facelift.

13:25.600 --> 13:30.880
You're saying you are saying cut, cut, cut the tip and clip the chip.

13:30.880 --> 13:38.400
Clip the chip and cut the tip, get your baby looking as fresh as the day he was not even

13:38.400 --> 13:42.480
the day he was born, I suppose, but maybe the few weeks ago when he was looking all

13:42.480 --> 13:42.800
right.

13:42.800 --> 13:48.800
Change your kind of change your William Daniels into a Bill Daniels.

13:48.800 --> 13:49.840
Who's a young actor?

13:50.960 --> 13:52.000
Bill Daniels.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.400
Turn your William Daniels into a Daniel Ratcliffe.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.640
That works fine, but he has some lines.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.080
He has some unsightly lines, too.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.280
Well, it's a lightning bolt.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.280
Okay, you don't need to be an asshole about it.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.960
I'm a 25 year old student and I'm in a pickle.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.920
The vast majority of my friends are women all the way from high school through uni.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.840
Excuse me, college.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.240
Thank you.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.800
And the various places where I've been employed, I'm perfectly fine with this.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.920
I enjoy their company and I don't feel like I'm missing anything by not having a group

14:19.920 --> 14:21.360
of male friends to bro out with.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.760
So I'm assuming this is a man writing this.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.880
However, I'm not doing so well in the romantic scene.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.760
Whenever I tried asking a girl out, I got rejected.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.960
Even when she was a lesbian.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.360
Stop.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.000
Whoa.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.040
No, it doesn't say that.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.760
I don't need any help getting out of the friend zone.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.040
That concept is stupid.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.240
And besides, I'm quite fine with keeping my friends as friends.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.360
I just don't understand why I seem to get along with women so well in a platonic context,

14:43.360 --> 14:45.440
but fail miserably whenever I try to find that special someone.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.480
Help me out, brothers.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.200
How do I find that other half of my life that I'm missing?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.760
And that's from Lovelorn in the Levant.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.960
Oh, that's a great pen name.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.280
Jesus Christ almighty.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.800
I feel like we're about to get into some shit here.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.880
I think we're about to get in the shit.

15:06.880 --> 15:10.000
Put on your muck boots and just jump right in.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.880
Because yeah, I think a lot of people are like this.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.120
I know I certainly was.

15:17.120 --> 15:22.880
I think it's safe to say like coming up, most of my friends were, you know, theater friends

15:22.880 --> 15:27.120
all the way up through like high school and even a lot of college.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.080
And so a lot of those theater friends were women.

15:30.800 --> 15:37.600
And I was really good friends with a lot of women, but not such great friends with sex.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.560
I was not-

15:40.560 --> 15:41.600
Sex and I, not close.

15:41.600 --> 15:47.760
Me and basically any erotic activity were not, how I say this, acquainted.

15:48.560 --> 15:48.800
Right.

15:49.360 --> 15:54.000
I mean, the answer to your question is right there in the question.

15:54.000 --> 16:01.120
You've been making friends with women from high school all the way through university

16:02.320 --> 16:07.600
for a decade now, and you are comfortable with that idea.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.880
You're comfortable with that relationship.

16:08.880 --> 16:15.600
You're practiced in like the social ramifications of those relationships.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.160
And you just haven't practiced outside of that.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.920
So like, it's not that surprising that you would get good at the thing that you have

16:23.920 --> 16:25.840
done over and over and over again.

16:25.840 --> 16:30.320
I think the secret is you've got to start back at scratch a little bit when you're

16:30.320 --> 16:34.000
talking about something that could be more romantic.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.320
Like you have to give yourself permission to be kind of a neophyte when it comes to

16:40.320 --> 16:43.760
that, because it sounds like you don't have nearly the amount of experience.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.960
Do you think that those two ideas are mutually exclusive though?

16:46.960 --> 16:50.080
Because I might just be like conflating them in a way that doesn't make any sense.

16:50.080 --> 16:55.840
Because it's super, super, super great that you recognize that the friend zone idea is

16:55.840 --> 17:05.760
bullshit and that nobody should treat their pool of friends who are female as a potential

17:06.320 --> 17:10.000
grazing ground if only you know how to make that conversion.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.760
That's a super fucked up way to think.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.000
And that's great that you understand that.

17:14.000 --> 17:23.360
But is there some sort of connection between knowing how to be friends with women without

17:23.360 --> 17:29.600
being gross about it and not being especially romantically adept?

17:29.600 --> 17:33.280
No, I don't think it's about being friends with women.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.440
I think it's just about being friends.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.760
Like you are good at being friends.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.960
You are not so good at romance because you haven't practiced as much.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.720
I think, okay, this is so thwarting to talk about.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.280
I know.

17:45.280 --> 17:45.840
It really is.

17:46.640 --> 17:51.440
The thing that's hard about it is like we are, A, I know we're approaching this from

17:51.440 --> 17:56.000
like a like really crazy heteronormative like position.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
So I keep getting tripped up on like gender pronouns and what have you.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.640
I don't think anything we're talking about is like exclusive to anyone's sex or gender

18:04.640 --> 18:05.360
or anything.

18:05.360 --> 18:11.040
I mean, I think that it is completely applicable to no matter where you fall on the gender

18:11.040 --> 18:12.240
and sexuality spectrum.

18:12.240 --> 18:18.720
I think that any, I think all I'm getting at is that romantic relationships are a different

18:18.720 --> 18:24.160
skill set and it's a different thing that you need to learn and part of the reason you're

18:24.160 --> 18:31.280
being so successful with making friends with these people and not in like a romantic sense

18:31.280 --> 18:34.560
is because when you're making friends with people, you're not putting any pressure on

18:34.560 --> 18:34.880
yourself.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.600
Exactly.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.920
It's the exact same way as when you're in like a committed relationship, you seem to

18:39.920 --> 18:45.120
do better with people who would find you repellent before.

18:45.120 --> 18:50.960
It's because you're not playing the game, you're not putting a bunch of pressure on

18:50.960 --> 18:52.560
yourself, you're just being yourself.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.800
I will also say this, it makes me think about, you know, like when you get out of a long

18:56.800 --> 19:01.840
relationship and then the next time like you get back in the dating pool, the problem you

19:01.840 --> 19:06.800
run into is trying to jump too quickly to the level you were at in your previous relationship

19:06.800 --> 19:10.560
and like that can screw things up and like you're coming into it going, oh, I'm so rusty,

19:10.560 --> 19:12.320
I'm so used to being in the relationship.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.840
Maybe that same thing is applying here where it's like you're so used to being in a

19:15.840 --> 19:20.960
friendship that you're just like trying to jump to that level of comfort with the

19:20.960 --> 19:24.160
person because you're so comfortable with all your other female friends.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.360
I don't think that's necessarily unhealthy.

19:25.360 --> 19:29.840
I think what Justin said was exactly right, which is the only distinction between those

19:29.840 --> 19:35.040
different skill sets is the pressure that you put on yourself when you are trying to

19:35.040 --> 19:37.120
pursue a romantic relationship with somebody.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.040
But isn't that pressure kind of good because it makes you like, you know, performance

19:41.040 --> 19:45.600
or your best and like try your best with a person for some people.

19:45.600 --> 19:51.120
But like I, that, that pressure I think is, is nominal and you don't, there are people

19:51.120 --> 19:53.760
who let it just fucking wreck everything.

19:53.760 --> 19:58.560
And, and, and that is, that's where you need to pump the brakes a little bit and knowing

19:58.560 --> 19:59.760
nothing about your situation.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.960
I would say that, that, you know, might be the most likely thing of like, well, this

20:02.960 --> 20:07.600
has to be different from how I treat my other friends when really like relationships like

20:07.600 --> 20:13.120
romantic relationships are just friendship with a little bit that extra fire.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.320
You know what I mean?

20:15.120 --> 20:16.880
Whoa, so beautiful.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.640
That's beautiful.

20:18.640 --> 20:22.800
We've been talking very, very seriously for a while and I hope we didn't fart some poop.

20:22.800 --> 20:22.960
Yeah.

20:22.960 --> 20:23.440
Okay.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.480
Who are those guys?

20:24.480 --> 20:25.760
Should we have a Yahoo?

20:25.760 --> 20:26.080
Yeah.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.360
Yahoo would be great Griffin.

20:27.360 --> 20:33.200
This Yahoo was sent in by level 451 Yahoo shaman Drew Davenport.

20:33.200 --> 20:42.320
Uh, this Yahoo was asked by Yahoo Answers user Sadie who asks, haunted corn maze actor

20:42.320 --> 20:43.120
tips, please.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.440
I'm working in a maze this year and my character is a saloon girl cannibal and I can't think

20:49.440 --> 20:50.720
of anything to say.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.480
What would be scary to you?

20:52.480 --> 20:55.280
How about another bottle of sarsaparilla?

20:55.280 --> 20:55.600
Okay.

20:56.480 --> 21:00.720
So I'm not sure that a portmanteau is like, I know that you're fucking terrified of those

21:00.720 --> 21:03.680
things when people put two words together that should be a part.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.520
Ah, no, thanks.

21:05.520 --> 21:05.760
Yeah.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.160
I mean, I'm terrified of them for good reason though.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.560
I mean, look at how I brought this show to a screeching halt.

21:10.560 --> 21:10.800
Yeah.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.280
How about this?

21:11.280 --> 21:14.800
Like, uh, hey cowboy, I bet you get pretty hungry out there on the range.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.400
Care for a bite?

21:18.160 --> 21:19.520
Cause she's a, cause she's a cannibal.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.360
That's like a slow, that's like a line from-

21:21.360 --> 21:22.000
Where are you going?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.280
Wait, I haven't finished my sentence.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.800
That's like, that's like, sounds like she's trying to like seduce him and eat him like

21:26.800 --> 21:27.520
a praying mantis.

21:27.520 --> 21:27.680
Right.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.600
It sounds like a line from old west species.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.280
But also- Is that not what's going on?

21:31.280 --> 21:33.280
It's just not how corn mazes work.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.040
Where you jump out and you're like- He's gone.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.880
You're like, bruh, hey there cowboy, you look hungry because you've been out on the range.

21:38.880 --> 21:43.600
You've been taking the long road from Tuscaloosa and it looks to me like, ah shit, another one.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.160
Oh, I, I know, just jump out and yell.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.000
I got my masters for this.

21:48.000 --> 21:48.320
Yeah.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.040
I went to, I went to corn maze school.

21:52.080 --> 21:56.000
I was on three episodes of, uh, Days of Our Lives.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.600
From a, from a day player on psych to this.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.640
I, why do you need characters in a corn maze?

22:02.640 --> 22:08.960
Well, a corn, a corn maze is the fucking scariest imaginable place that you can be.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.480
A, you could die in there.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.320
You could just get lost and die in there.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.120
It happens every year.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.080
There's like 30 deaths.

22:14.080 --> 22:18.160
It's like more than, um, more than shark bites.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.400
Um, B- And way more than shark tank.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.200
B- It goes, it goes corn maze.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.560
Corn mazes, shark attacks.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.240
And then pop machines falling over on people.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.600
Pop machines falling over on people.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.880
That's exactly right.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.120
B- corn is the scariest vegetable.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.000
It looks like a knife.

22:34.240 --> 22:34.880
It looks like a knife.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.000
It's got a fucking hilt.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.360
It has its own scabbard.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.240
So maybe a sword.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.920
Knives typically don't have scabbards or hilts.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.720
Um, C- Scarecrows.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.160
Right.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.240
It's just there.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.200
It's just right there.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.720
I just, why not, why not just like wear a scary mask and jump out?

22:50.720 --> 22:53.520
Do you think the guy who invented the scarecrow,

22:53.520 --> 22:56.160
like on the day he invented it, he was like,

22:56.160 --> 22:59.520
ah, that's pretty, uh, and he invented it during the daytime.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.640
He was like, I got to figure out something to do to get rid of these crows.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.200
Wait a minute.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.080
I got it.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.040
I'll make a scarecrow.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.640
And he made it up in the daytime.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.680
He was like, eh, pretty good invention, old timey man.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.640
I think I crushed it.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.520
And then that first night he looks out the windows like,

23:13.520 --> 23:15.440
what the fuck have I done?

23:16.240 --> 23:19.440
This is this, hey Martha, come look at this shit.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.640
I'm losing my mind.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.600
Look what I did.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.960
I made the scariest thing ever.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.520
So now I'm a, I'm a nightmare weaver, Martha.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.720
I'm a nightmare weaver.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.040
I am Edgar Allan Poe.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.800
I made a, I made a scare human.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.480
I'm Stephen King, senior, senior, senior.

23:35.360 --> 23:39.360
I can't believe I just created this terrifying vision.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.720
I was at Home Depot the other day buying a fire pit

23:42.720 --> 23:47.040
and they had their, you know, they had their autumn regalia out

23:47.040 --> 23:51.200
and there was a fucking scarecrow that was just like propped out in the garden section

23:51.200 --> 23:52.960
and there were actually crows on it.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.720
Like actual crows just like chilling.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.400
Pretty good scarecrow.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.880
Pretty good job inventor of the scarecrow.

23:58.880 --> 24:02.480
You invented things that can only scare humans and nothing else.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.360
Well done, sir.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.040
No, the world wasn't scary enough.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.200
Let's go ahead and get more stuff

24:07.200 --> 24:09.840
and make sure that we surround it with knife-shaped produce.

24:09.840 --> 24:10.960
Terrific job.

24:10.960 --> 24:16.160
The worst part about that is that guy had to watch all the time to see if it was working.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.920
He just had to stare at that thing.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.800
Maybe set up like an old timey lawn chair next to it

24:20.800 --> 24:22.080
and just see if the crows were coming.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.520
And eventually they became friends.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.080
I lost a shoe in a corn maze once.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.760
Do you remember those books that like you used to buy at the Scholastic Book Fair

24:29.760 --> 24:32.720
that were like scary story six or whatever?

24:32.720 --> 24:34.640
Yeah, goose pimples.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.560
They were scary as fuck.

24:37.280 --> 24:41.520
There was one about like a scarecrow that like peeled people's skin off

24:41.520 --> 24:44.000
and laid it out to dry on a barn or some shit.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.080
Yeah, but it was actually Richard Gere dressed up like a scarecrow.

24:48.080 --> 24:52.800
Well, I think that's the plot of the hit West Virginia made film Dark Harvest.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.240
Richard starring.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.560
I can't believe they got Richard Gere in that independent film production.

24:56.560 --> 24:57.680
Yeah, it's a big hit.

24:57.680 --> 24:58.720
But actually that's funny.

24:58.720 --> 25:02.560
Richard Gere is in the Mothman movie, which is set in West Virginia.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.720
Right, he was in WV.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.560
He was like, let me swing by for Dark Harvest.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.120
But I'm also-

25:07.120 --> 25:08.560
Let me get into Dark Harvest real quick.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.600
I'll play a scarecrow.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.080
It'll be easy for me because I do that shit in real life.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.720
Every scarecrow you see, Richard Gere's in there somewhere.

25:14.720 --> 25:15.840
And he wants your skin.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.800
He would love it.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.520
He would love nothing-

25:17.520 --> 25:18.720
That's how he stays looking so young.

25:18.720 --> 25:22.080
He would love nothing more than to take your skin, put it on himself,

25:22.080 --> 25:24.800
get rid of those fucking William Daniels wrinkles.

25:24.800 --> 25:28.880
When he does that charming Richard Gere wink, that's his eyelid skin falling off.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.680
And he's trying to scoot it back in place.

25:31.680 --> 25:36.640
There's a special motion graphics designer that works on every fucking film he's in

25:37.520 --> 25:39.040
that has to edit that shit out.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.320
That has to edit out the sloughing of his skin to the floor.

25:42.320 --> 25:50.320
Guys, if one celebrity besides Richard Gere had to be every scarecrow,

25:51.840 --> 25:57.840
which actor or actress do you think would be, is like the most like a scarecrow?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.560
I think Jeff Goldblum is very much like a scarecrow.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.080
Well, that's not fair.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.400
No, he's like an American treasure.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.640
I love Jeff Goldblum.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.800
Are you saying because he has the dimensions of a scarecrow?

26:08.800 --> 26:09.360
Is that what you're saying?

26:09.360 --> 26:10.640
Because that's hateful.

26:10.640 --> 26:13.360
I'm just saying if it turned out he was a scarecrow the whole time,

26:13.360 --> 26:14.080
I wouldn't be surprised.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.200
Bushimi too.

26:15.200 --> 26:15.600
Well, that's-

26:15.600 --> 26:16.640
Okay, I'm sorry, Justin.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.600
I hate to call you on semantics, but you wouldn't be surprised

26:19.600 --> 26:22.640
if it turned out that Jeff Goldblum had been a scarecrow all along.

26:22.640 --> 26:28.320
If Jeff Goldblum just fell over at the Oscars and a bunch of straw poured out of him,

26:28.320 --> 26:30.160
you'd be like, I fucking knew it.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.120
I told everyone.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.080
I'm 33.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.760
It's very hard to surprise me.

26:33.760 --> 26:40.240
We met Jeff Goldblum outside the show door at the Rainmaker and-

26:40.240 --> 26:43.520
I lit a cigarette and he lost his fucking mind.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.560
Explain that.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.760
He said like, what, hey?

26:45.760 --> 26:48.480
He said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.400
That's my Jeff Goldblum impression.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.320
Yeah, it sounds a little bit like Yogi Bear.

26:52.320 --> 26:52.880
No, no, no, no.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.600
But hey.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.960
We must get away.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.800
We must get away from the cigarette.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.080
Hey, no, no, no, no.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.280
Hey, hey, Badda Badda.

27:03.920 --> 27:04.720
Impressions.

27:04.720 --> 27:10.720
If we're going to afford all of these anti-Richard Gear wards

27:10.720 --> 27:13.040
that we have to hang in every room of our house,

27:13.040 --> 27:14.160
we're going to need some more money.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.440
We're going to need some more intake.

27:15.440 --> 27:26.560
Let's go to my room.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.360
Two words, people.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.920
Two words.

27:29.920 --> 27:30.560
Piss beard.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.400
Piss beard.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.920
No, you can't say that, Griffin, because we haven't-

27:33.920 --> 27:34.640
Ah, fuck.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.000
We broke the time stream.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.600
We ran out of time reversal cubes.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.240
Don't worry, guys.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.880
We're going to talk about piss beards here in a few minutes.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.640
And you're going to realize why, and you're

27:44.640 --> 27:46.080
going to love the jokes.

27:46.080 --> 27:46.400
Go on, Jeff.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.400
But the two words are free snacks.

27:49.040 --> 27:49.760
Yes.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.480
If you act now, we're going to give you the opportunity

27:52.480 --> 27:53.360
to get free snacks.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.080
And here's the thing.

27:54.880 --> 27:58.160
Snacks are not only good, they're good for you,

27:58.160 --> 27:59.360
if you get the right ones.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.040
You got to get delicious, wholesome snacks

28:01.040 --> 28:02.400
at naturebox.com.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.960
We've been talking about Naturebox for, I think, 18 years

28:04.960 --> 28:05.760
now.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.840
And if you haven't tried it, you are a fool.

28:07.840 --> 28:08.800
You're a fool.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.200
I'm thinking about-

28:09.200 --> 28:10.560
But maybe this is your first episode.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.840
Maybe you've never listened to it before.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.040
Then you're still a fool.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.240
Here's the deal with Naturebox.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.360
Naturebox gives you hundreds of snack options.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.160
And these are like, really, all three of us are subscribers

28:20.160 --> 28:21.520
and very, very happy about it.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.600
You'll find snacks with no added sugar, no gluten,

28:26.320 --> 28:27.200
that kind of stuff.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.240
It's all in there.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.280
Everything for everyone.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.600
Which makes them sound shitty, but they're actually

28:31.600 --> 28:34.000
extremely good and very delicious.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.240
I'm thinking about getting on that Benjamin Franklin schedule

28:36.240 --> 28:39.280
where I just eat only snacks 20 times a day.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.560
I have 20 little meals and it'll be like sunflower

28:42.560 --> 28:43.440
kettle kernels.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.960
Known picture of health, Ben Franklin.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.480
Well, later on-

28:47.360 --> 28:49.120
You get to go through and pick whatever you want.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.800
And it's way like peanut butter nom-noms are kind of like

28:52.800 --> 28:53.440
the go-to.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.480
There's like a cocoa nom-nom that's so good.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.280
That's what Theresa and I, all we did was like eat Naturebox

28:59.280 --> 29:01.200
as we drove across the country.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.800
And it kept us going.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.320
Kept us from murdering each other.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.200
It was really nice.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.240
With Naturebox, we used to do a 50% off thing.

29:08.240 --> 29:08.800
This is new.

29:09.360 --> 29:13.440
You're going to get a free trial box by going to

29:13.440 --> 29:15.360
naturebox.com slash my brother.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.040
You can get five of the most popular snacks for free.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.000
That's huge.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.520
I had no idea that we were doing that.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.160
Here, enjoy.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.440
Oh, are you starving?

29:21.440 --> 29:24.080
Give us your hungry, your tired, your poor.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.760
Here are five snacks.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.920
If you don't do it at this point where you get a free box,

29:29.920 --> 29:30.720
like what are you doing?

29:30.720 --> 29:32.400
What's your fucking problem?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.680
Do you hate food?

29:33.680 --> 29:34.480
Are you a plant?

29:35.520 --> 29:36.960
Are you a plant or a person?

29:36.960 --> 29:38.880
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother, you plant.

29:38.880 --> 29:39.680
Come on, plant.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.840
Come on, stupid plant.

29:41.840 --> 29:44.880
My Brother, My Brother, Me is also supported by Squarespace,

29:44.880 --> 29:47.520
the all-in-one platform that makes it fast and easy to create

29:47.520 --> 29:50.240
your own professional website or online portfolio.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.640
They really are some good looking goddamn websites.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.280
As a person who's taken like two and a half hours of Code

29:57.280 --> 30:01.520
Academy lessons, I can say that this is some sound coding

30:01.520 --> 30:02.480
that they've done here.

30:02.480 --> 30:05.360
Some sound web design and programming.

30:06.480 --> 30:09.280
They have all kinds of presets that you can use that are

30:09.280 --> 30:11.440
beautiful to start out with, and then you can chop and screw

30:11.440 --> 30:12.160
them how you like.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.280
They have a support team that's available 24-7.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.840
They have a logo generator to design your own logo.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.760
Not everybody has their own Justin Russo.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.720
Some people need software.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.880
It starts at $8 a month, and that includes a free domain name

30:26.880 --> 30:27.920
if you sign up for a year.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.440
Maybe you're like me and you listen to other podcasts,

30:31.440 --> 30:33.120
and you've heard about Squarespace before, but you've

30:33.120 --> 30:33.840
never checked it out.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.080
Well, let me tell you why this is different.

30:36.080 --> 30:40.000
If you check it out using our code, it benefits us.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.280
We get stuff from it.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.000
Yeah, it helps us rather than those other shitty podcasts

30:44.000 --> 30:45.920
that you listen to, so this is important.

30:45.920 --> 30:46.960
It really is great.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.040
It's all responsive design, so your site will work on every

30:51.040 --> 30:52.720
device conceivable.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.040
Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.720
So go to Squarespace.com and use the offer code MYBROTHER.

30:58.720 --> 31:02.320
That's all one word, MYBROTHER, to get 10% off your first

31:02.320 --> 31:03.040
purchase.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.560
That's Squarespace.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.960
A better web starts with your website.

31:08.960 --> 31:12.800
It's got to fucking be the change you want to see on the

31:12.800 --> 31:14.240
information superhighway.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.000
I got a message for Jeff and Dylan, and it's from Jeff,

31:18.000 --> 31:19.360
but a different Jeff.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.080
What are the odds?

31:20.720 --> 31:21.520
I know.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.480
Jeffrey and Dylan.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.040
Happy five month anniversary, Jeffrey and Dylan.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.600
Jeffrey and Dylan, sorry for the delay, Jeffrey and Dylan.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.920
For the only person tardier than the brothers is me, Jeffrey

31:29.920 --> 31:30.480
and Dylan.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.480
Jeffrey and Dylan, some serious apologies, Jeffrey and

31:32.480 --> 31:33.200
Dylan.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.760
Jeffrey and Dylan, do you want to get a drink later, Jeffrey

31:35.760 --> 31:36.400
and Dylan?

31:36.400 --> 31:37.520
Absolutely.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.640
Fantastic.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.000
Nothing I can add there.

31:42.000 --> 31:42.800
You did it.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.760
Congratulations.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.680
You split the goof uprights.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.560
We said no goofs on this episode, and yet you managed to

31:48.560 --> 31:49.840
pull one out of the abyss.

31:49.840 --> 31:50.720
Squeak one in.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.360
Then I got another message for Trailer from-

31:53.360 --> 31:54.080
Whoa!

31:54.080 --> 31:56.080
You could not have fucked that up worse.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.480
It's from Trevor.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.520
Trevor, I'm sorry.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.320
I pined for you.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.800
Autumn is who the message is from.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.600
It's from Airstream.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.360
Autumn says, hi Tee.

32:11.280 --> 32:11.760
Hi Tee.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.120
Hi Tee Tee.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.080
Yep.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.840
That nickname is official since the McBros-

32:15.840 --> 32:18.480
Sorry, he's got a new better nickname, and that's Trailer.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.160
We made it up called Trailer.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.560
Thanks for letting me paint your toenails and fart on you while

32:24.560 --> 32:25.200
you're sleeping.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.880
I've been doing it for almost four years now.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.160
Yay, love.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.160
The shout out is the best drunk purchase ever.

32:30.160 --> 32:30.720
Yes, it is.

32:30.720 --> 32:31.600
You're the best.

32:32.320 --> 32:36.480
And then this says, please follow message with more Amelie

32:37.520 --> 32:38.240
impersonation.

32:38.240 --> 32:41.280
It sounds like she wants Trailer to do that.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.800
I have a happy birthday, Trailer.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.440
I am in your glove compartment.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.120
I don't think it's Trailer's birthday,

32:49.120 --> 32:50.480
but maybe in Amelie's world.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.560
Happy birthday, Trailer.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.360
In Amelie's world, it's everyone's birthday all the time.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.440
Everyone is birthday all the time.

32:58.080 --> 32:58.800
Fantastic.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.240
Everyone is birthday.

33:00.240 --> 33:00.800
So best-

33:00.800 --> 33:01.680
That's true today.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.480
Best money zone yet.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.680
Mark your calendars for a brand new thing.

33:07.680 --> 33:13.680

33:35.520 --> 33:37.840
Oh shit, breaking news.

33:38.880 --> 33:42.800
We've got some farm wisdom.

33:42.800 --> 33:43.760
I can't believe it.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.640
Farm wisdom.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.840
Put your scarecrow in the barn, farm wisdom.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.120
And then light that barn on fire.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.640
Stop him anyway you can, farm wisdom.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.680
Griffin, I would like you to read it, please.

33:55.680 --> 33:56.180
Okay.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.680
This is the worst thing I've ever read.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.480
This is the world's worst sentence.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.280
Thank you for listening to my brother, my brother, and me.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.960
This is the world's worst sentence.

34:06.960 --> 34:10.640
You're hearing the debut of the world's worst sentence right now.

34:10.640 --> 34:11.440
Here it comes.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.880
All right, you're not, your life is not gonna be the same.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.760
This is going to be the moment that you'll always remember

34:17.760 --> 34:19.520
of where it all started to go bad.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.080
Your whole existence.

34:20.080 --> 34:20.960
There's still time to get out.

34:20.960 --> 34:24.160
There's still time to leave before the world's worst sentence.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.080
Billy goats pee in their mouth and beard when they're horny.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.720
And that's from Cassandra and Micah,

34:30.720 --> 34:32.960
who just ruined the lives of 30 million people.

34:35.600 --> 34:39.920
What Cassandra and Micah do not include is the phrase on purpose.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.600
Is it like an accident thing?

34:41.600 --> 34:44.160
Is it like they're like so horny, like shit, not again.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.440
Oh man, not again.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.440
Piss beard.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.000
I gotta stop getting so horny and then peeing on myself.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.200
Horny all the time.

34:51.200 --> 34:55.280
Uh, hey, Greg, uh, yeah, Mitch, what's going on?

34:55.280 --> 35:03.200
Yeah, Greg, uh, just so you know, I noticed that when my wife stopped by earlier this week,

35:03.200 --> 35:03.840
you know, Darla?

35:03.840 --> 35:04.800
Yeah, I know Darla.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.480
Yeah, I noticed when she stopped by, your beard smelled like piss.

35:08.480 --> 35:13.760
And I, I want you to explain that to me right now, or our friendship is over.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.240
The reason for that, and I think I figured it out,

35:16.240 --> 35:18.080
is that I watched you piss in your mouth and beard.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.880
So, should we dissect this?

35:22.880 --> 35:24.560
Is there something we need to talk about?

35:24.560 --> 35:26.080
Is there something going on here?

35:26.080 --> 35:28.800
What I want to find out, but I'm not willing to look it up,

35:28.800 --> 35:31.600
is if it's like they do it and react to it,

35:31.600 --> 35:34.720
or if it's just like something that happens and they just stand there

35:34.720 --> 35:38.320
continuing to be horny, gently peeing in their mouths and beards.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.480
Do you think that's why they eat all that garbage?

35:40.480 --> 35:41.600
Because they're trying to find something.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.880
Because they feel like garbage?

35:44.720 --> 35:46.240
I feel like garbage.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.480
This is what I deserve.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.760
I deserve this.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.080
Look at me, I'm a monster.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.760
It's, it's super weird.

35:53.760 --> 35:59.600
This past summer, I went and saw Disney planes fire and rescue,

35:59.600 --> 36:02.240
and I started pissing in my mouth and beard.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.920
So I guess, is it planes that talking planes do it, do it for me?

36:05.920 --> 36:11.680
Is it maybe the whole Cars universe?

36:11.680 --> 36:13.520
I'm changing, I'm metamorphosizing,

36:13.520 --> 36:16.640
because fucking Cassandra and Micah just ruined my life.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.360
Thank you Cassandra and Micah for that sentence.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.520
Do you think Zambonis are the fat people of the Carsverse?

36:25.520 --> 36:27.360
Probably not.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.240
How about a question?

36:29.280 --> 36:31.600
I'm very awkward when it comes to receiving compliments,

36:31.600 --> 36:34.880
and although it's very nice to hear that someone likes something I'm wearing,

36:34.880 --> 36:37.920
or my new haircut, I always have some very odd responses.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.600
I have a terrible habit of needing to respond where I got something,

36:41.600 --> 36:44.400
or how I got it, as soon as it's acknowledged.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.440
Now, if getting these things from somewhere interesting,

36:47.440 --> 36:49.680
or I had a cool story behind them that might be different,

36:49.680 --> 36:53.200
but most of my clothes I get secondhand, or I cut my own hair,

36:53.200 --> 36:54.960
so our conversation usually ends in a lull,

36:54.960 --> 36:57.600
where the person stares at me, waiting for some sort of point to my story.

36:58.480 --> 37:03.360
For others, how can I learn to respond to things without going on long and boring tangents?

37:03.360 --> 37:05.600
Uh, not unlike this question.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.480
Okay, wait, I want to play this out.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.320
Justin, I need you to compliment my hair.

37:12.320 --> 37:12.880
Okay.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.720
Okay, hey Travis, your haircut's looking good.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.520
I cut it myself.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.560
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.760
Can I- you know, I was laughing when you were reading that question.

37:21.760 --> 37:28.720
I came to the slow and horrifying realization that nobody in the fullness of my lifetime

37:28.720 --> 37:34.240
has ever asked me where I got an article of clothing or haircut in my life, ever.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.920
Is my shit super busted?

37:35.920 --> 37:38.400
Is it because I only wear clothes I bought at Target,

37:38.400 --> 37:41.920
and Target clothes are designed to be almost camouflage-esque,

37:41.920 --> 37:43.520
almost like razzle-dazzle?

37:43.520 --> 37:46.320
They're super fucking hard to like, get a lock on my clothes,

37:46.320 --> 37:49.120
because they're so normal, all my Mossimo jeans.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.040
Where did you get those Mossimo jeans?

37:51.040 --> 37:52.320
I must know.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.560
Was it Target, the only place where they have those?

37:55.280 --> 37:57.040
Are you even wearing jeans right now?

37:57.040 --> 38:02.880
I'm trying to focus on the bottom half of your body, and I can't-

38:02.880 --> 38:05.360
My attention just slides off here.

38:05.360 --> 38:09.440
I'm trying to focus on the same two flannel shirts you've bought 20 times,

38:09.440 --> 38:12.080
but it doesn't seem to stick for some reason.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.040
You literally blend in with everything.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.760
Where did you get your hair buzzed with a size six guard every fucking time

38:19.760 --> 38:20.880
for the past seven years?

38:21.600 --> 38:22.320
I must know.

38:22.320 --> 38:23.200
You pay somebody to do that?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.080
What do you call that?

38:24.080 --> 38:26.960
Oh, I call it the same haircut I've gotten for a long, long time.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.120
No, Rachel does it for me in our backyard.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.520
It's a pretty good money-saving tip.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.160
Have Rachel cut your hair.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.760
Have my wife cut your hair in our backyard.

38:35.760 --> 38:36.640
She does a great job.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.360
She gets a little nervous about cutting the bangs,

38:39.360 --> 38:42.720
which I don't blame her because that is the money zone.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.080
That's my money zone.

38:44.080 --> 38:51.040
You know where this gets awkward is I have a shirt that I made with Justin Russo.

38:51.040 --> 38:57.440
Uh, we, we had a clothing line, uh, for a while called 100% Juddalo

38:57.440 --> 39:03.680
because I thought it was pretty funny to replace Jug in Juddalo with Judd

39:04.320 --> 39:08.960
and make a shirt that said 100% Juddalo and it had a picture of the Judds on it.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.680
And I will occasionally receive compliments on this shirt

39:12.240 --> 39:14.720
and then I have to look at this person straight in the eye and say,

39:14.720 --> 39:16.160
Thanks, I'm an idiot.

39:16.160 --> 39:20.160
Thanks, I'm a stupid animal.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.480
You can find some if you want.

39:22.480 --> 39:26.000
But if the question is, I need an interesting response,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.880
I don't feel like you get more interesting than thanks.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.080
I made it myself.

39:30.800 --> 39:31.760
And then they go, what?

39:31.760 --> 39:32.720
No, you didn't.

39:32.720 --> 39:36.320
Yes, I did because I thought it was funny, but now I feel stupid.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.920
I guess, I guess that's true.

39:38.480 --> 39:44.480
The problem is I forgot the link for so long that I can't tell people where to get their own.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.920
Geocities.com slash 100% Juddalo.

39:47.920 --> 39:52.240
As it turns out, it's Juddalo.spreadshirt.com.

39:54.080 --> 39:57.600
And apparently the last tweet from at Juddalo,

39:57.600 --> 40:01.920
Juddalo apparel official Twitter account was June of 2012.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.760
And I said, the people who have spoken,

40:03.760 --> 40:06.960
Juddalo begins work on his Judd Nelson shirt coming soon.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.040
That lies, empty promises.

40:09.040 --> 40:16.960
So that is not a thriving, I thought that would get me out of the podcast racket,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.920
but it didn't.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.680
Justin, I feel like more than either of us,

40:21.680 --> 40:27.200
you have a lot of distinctive apparel in the form of your,

40:27.200 --> 40:30.640
I mean, obviously the gold standard is your fat mama t-shirt,

40:32.400 --> 40:36.880
a t-shirt celebrating the personal brand of fat mama,

40:36.880 --> 40:41.520
who you might know, you won't know from the television show,

40:41.520 --> 40:43.760
who wants to be a superhero starring Stan Lee.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.920
I do have a fat mama shirt that I bought from fat mama.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.400
The problem is I can't see that shirt in the dark.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.920
Oh wait, I can.

40:53.920 --> 40:58.480
You can, because it does glow in the dark and of course there is a donut.

40:59.280 --> 41:05.840
I've gotten to a point, another fun tidbit about my wardrobe is that,

41:05.840 --> 41:10.480
is that my in-laws, Sidney's family,

41:11.280 --> 41:15.360
have made trips to Tybee Island in Georgia for a long time.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.320
That has been their vacation spot of choice for the past five years or so.

41:20.320 --> 41:28.080
And every time they went, they would bring me back a Tybee Island t-shirt that they purchased.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.680
And since I've been going with them,

41:29.680 --> 41:32.160
I have continued the tradition by buying Tybee Island t-shirts.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.520
So I started getting them ironically,

41:35.520 --> 41:37.440
like I laughed because her little sister picked them out.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.120
She was like six or seven at the time.

41:39.120 --> 41:42.960
So they maybe weren't the most fashion forward.

41:42.960 --> 41:46.240
And then all of a sudden it turned out that half of the clothes that I own say

41:46.240 --> 41:49.680
Tybee Island on them somewhere along with some other rejoinder,

41:49.680 --> 41:53.360
like it's five o'clock somewhere in Tybee Island.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.320
This is breaking Southern California news.

41:56.320 --> 41:59.680
Jesse Thorne is burst into flames somewhere and nobody knows why.

41:59.680 --> 42:04.720
You've been listening to Take This Off starring the McElroy brothers.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.440
Beach t-shirts relax me now.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.000
I don't know what it is.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.800
We're killing fashion one shirt at a time.

42:10.800 --> 42:11.280
Take that.

42:12.880 --> 42:13.520
So sue me.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.800
It's October in West Virginia.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.720
I'd like to live on island time for a day.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.640
I have Spotify open right now on my computer.

42:20.640 --> 42:21.920
Do you want me to blast you?

42:21.920 --> 42:23.280
Do you want me to put you on blast?

42:23.280 --> 42:26.880
Because I got your history right here in the sidebar taken back by Jimmy Buffett.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.320
What the fuck happened to you?

42:42.320 --> 42:44.960
I had a case of the Mondays.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.720
Are you fucking possessed?

42:48.080 --> 42:49.680
You used to be my brother.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.720
I had a case of the Mondays.

42:56.720 --> 43:01.200
I had this old Monday blues and I was just trying to chase it away.

43:02.240 --> 43:06.240
I just want to remind people of the concept of the show is that Justin makes up one-third

43:06.240 --> 43:09.680
of the team that feels qualified to tell other people how to live their life.

43:09.680 --> 43:10.800
How did you fuck all?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.040
You guys want to Yahoo?

43:15.040 --> 43:15.920
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

43:16.640 --> 43:17.140
Sure.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.440
This Yahoo was sent in by Justin Rubio.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.480
Thank you, Justin.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user JB who asks,

43:22.640 --> 43:26.240
Best fast rap hip-hop songs to have sex to.

43:27.280 --> 43:29.840
I love really fast and loud hip-hop songs.

43:29.840 --> 43:33.200
E.G. Drop by Timbaland and Magoo.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.480
Is that a person?

43:35.920 --> 43:36.640
I believe so, yeah.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.720
Or songs like Lip Gloss by Lil Mama.

43:39.440 --> 43:44.080
I also like fast-paced club music like Warp 1.9 by the Bloody Beat Roots.

43:44.080 --> 43:44.880
That's fake.

43:44.880 --> 43:45.380
Thanks.

43:47.280 --> 43:50.480
Fast rap hip-hop songs to have sex to.

43:50.480 --> 43:53.760
Fast rap hip-hop songs to have sex to.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.680
I like that mystical track, Hit Me.

44:00.720 --> 44:01.280
That'd be a good one.

44:01.280 --> 44:01.920
That's pretty good.

44:01.920 --> 44:05.280
I like Bombs Over Baghdad by Outkast except if you do that,

44:05.280 --> 44:08.720
the friction would break all the bones in both your bodies.

44:08.720 --> 44:13.120
Is there a point at which it becomes so sexy that it stops being sexy like Anaconda?

44:14.160 --> 44:16.160
Oh, that's the least erotic song, I think.

44:16.800 --> 44:17.200
Great job.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.360
You made a song about butts which are basically the best part that any of us have

44:21.360 --> 44:22.800
and you just kind of ruined it.

44:23.440 --> 44:27.440
You just kind of ruined the whole sort of concept of what a butt can be.

44:27.440 --> 44:30.800
It did come out of the point where there are like six other butt songs though.

44:30.800 --> 44:31.840
That is true.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.560
I didn't get that all about that bass was about.

44:34.560 --> 44:37.440
So I got confused and I was talking to friends about this the other day.

44:37.440 --> 44:42.400
Is all about that bass about big butts

44:42.400 --> 44:47.280
or is it about like them actually preferring like the low parts of songs?

44:47.280 --> 44:50.400
Griffin, the bridge is I'm bringing booty back.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.960
It just seems like I want her to pick one thing or the other.

44:53.920 --> 44:55.680
But she's all about that bass.

44:55.680 --> 44:56.240
You know what I mean?

44:56.240 --> 44:59.360
Like, like, you're not comfortable with the double entendres.

44:59.360 --> 44:59.840
I just don't.

45:00.800 --> 45:04.560
Do you like the song by JLo and Iggy Azalea simply called Booty?

45:04.560 --> 45:05.600
Is that clearer to you?

45:05.600 --> 45:08.240
Does that like fit more into your concept?

45:08.240 --> 45:08.720
I do.

45:08.720 --> 45:09.440
Yeah, I do.

45:09.440 --> 45:09.920
I do.

45:09.920 --> 45:11.040
And I'll tell you why.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.200
It's because what are we all about?

45:13.200 --> 45:13.760
Booty.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.720
Fantastic.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.280
Thank you.

45:15.280 --> 45:15.680
Me too.

45:16.240 --> 45:17.200
What are you all about?

45:17.200 --> 45:21.760
I'm about bass, like the low parts of music, but I also butts.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.960
And it's like I have.

45:22.960 --> 45:26.720
I've got a hit Bubba Sparks featuring Ying Yang's track for you.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.160
Griffin called Miss New Booty.

45:28.160 --> 45:28.560
Okay.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.800
Wherein the Ying Yang Twins just say booty booty booty.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.720
Yeah, no, that's fantastic.

45:33.360 --> 45:37.440
That's so many songs about booty, but not a lot of songs about breasts.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.320
That's a good.

45:38.320 --> 45:38.880
That's a great point.

45:38.880 --> 45:41.760
I mean, you never hear a song that's like, I like big boobs.

45:41.760 --> 45:42.560
They're pretty great.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.360
Brass everywhere.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.480
Brass, brass everywhere.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.320
Travis, you're apparently not familiar with Sir Mix-a-Lot's

45:48.960 --> 45:50.880
less popular follow up.

45:50.880 --> 45:51.840
Put them on the glass.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.720
But but we.

45:54.720 --> 45:55.440
Sorry, Travis.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.200
Sorry, Travis.

45:57.200 --> 45:58.000
Put them on the glass.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.040
My ticket and it in a little.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.400
Put them on the glass for me.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.040
I just did.

46:03.040 --> 46:03.600
And it was great.

46:04.560 --> 46:06.080
I put them on the glass.

46:06.080 --> 46:12.800
I think to get back to my point about all about that base is I think I just think it

46:12.800 --> 46:13.680
could be two songs.

46:14.640 --> 46:18.000
I think she could have one song that's like, isn't the low parts of music really great?

46:18.000 --> 46:21.280
And then another song that's like, hey, now now that we're done with that other song,

46:21.280 --> 46:22.640
let's talk about butts for a little while.

46:23.600 --> 46:27.200
I don't think that's what you're saying here with like a like a like queen did with

46:27.200 --> 46:28.880
we will rock you and we are the champion.

46:28.880 --> 46:29.920
That's exactly what I'm saying.

46:29.920 --> 46:30.720
It's a two part song.

46:30.720 --> 46:38.480
I'm saying it's like the Pure Prairie League Amy into in and out of love with you.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.800
I'm saying it's it's four play long time.

46:40.800 --> 46:42.720
I'm saying it's let's talk about butts.

46:42.720 --> 46:46.880
OK, next part of the song is her Layla and weird ending of Layla.

46:46.880 --> 46:48.000
That's what I'm saying.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.840
Travis, that's what I was just about to say.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.320
Why did Eric Clapton ruin Layla by putting a part at the end?

46:52.320 --> 46:53.920
That's not as good as the rest of the song.

46:53.920 --> 46:56.160
Please listen to this for another three minutes.

46:56.160 --> 47:00.480
How about you already started listening to this and here's some more of a song.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.760
I hope you weren't looking for the next song on the radio because it's going to be a while.

47:04.320 --> 47:07.840
I'm saying we have a brain stew situation on our hands or we could.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.760
I think it would be a much, much improved thing.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.320
It could be like all about that bass, about that bass.

47:12.320 --> 47:17.520
No treble and butts are cool and butts are great.

47:17.520 --> 47:20.080
They are better when they're big.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.840
That's what my mom said.

47:21.840 --> 47:26.640
That is just a prototype, I'm assuming you're going to smooth out some of these baby wrinkles.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.480
Butts and butts and butts and butts.

47:28.480 --> 47:29.440
Good job, butts.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.400
Keep it up.

47:30.400 --> 47:33.040
Hey, but let's talk about you now.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.960
You have nothing to do with music.

47:34.960 --> 47:37.600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.600
And then it's mostly hey after that.

47:39.600 --> 47:40.720
I would buy that track.

47:40.720 --> 47:41.600
It's a good track.

47:41.600 --> 47:42.720
It's two tracks.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.600
Double your money.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.400
This is what I'm saying.

47:44.400 --> 47:47.760
So many young artists, musical artists are fucking broke nowadays.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.960
All of your favorites, Coldplay, they have nothing.

47:50.960 --> 47:51.760
They have no money.

47:51.760 --> 47:52.400
They have no dollars.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.000
Because of their song about butts and music.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.040
It's all about butts and music.

47:57.040 --> 47:57.600
Exactly.

47:58.640 --> 47:59.760
Sorry, Travis.

47:59.760 --> 48:00.400
Sorry.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.040
Hold on.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.320
Breaking news.

48:02.320 --> 48:10.960
Travis, your fucking 100 Lives of Blackjack Savage pull has just been outdone by your

48:10.960 --> 48:17.520
obscure reference to the hit musical, A New Brain, starring the guy from Caroline in the City.

48:18.560 --> 48:19.920
It couldn't be done.

48:19.920 --> 48:23.680
It was so obscure that I didn't even realize it was a fucking reference.

48:23.680 --> 48:26.800
So that's where we are as an entertainment show now.

48:26.800 --> 48:28.880
So now one third of us got it.

48:29.520 --> 48:33.200
What I'm saying, the point that I'm making is that this young lady, this young musical

48:33.200 --> 48:34.880
artist can double her profits.

48:34.880 --> 48:39.200
She can have two chart toppers instead of just the one that is going to get the iTunes

48:39.200 --> 48:39.920
downloads.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.040
It's all about fucking diversifying.

48:41.040 --> 48:42.160
But here's the question.

48:42.160 --> 48:47.520
Does the song about music have the same draw as the song about butts?

48:47.520 --> 48:50.160
It does if you fucking attach them.

48:50.160 --> 48:54.240
You know, the good thing about it is that I feel comfortable giving my baby daughter

48:54.240 --> 48:57.920
a song about music and the low parts of music.

48:57.920 --> 48:58.400
Exactly.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.320
Her hearing is fully formed.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.200
I'm excited about that.

49:01.200 --> 49:04.160
I can't let her hear a song that's even obliquely about butts.

49:05.200 --> 49:05.680
Exactly.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.600
She'll find out about butts in her own good time.

49:07.600 --> 49:08.720
I'm not exposing her to that.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.720
So have you not let her listen to Back to Pooh Corner?

49:11.520 --> 49:14.400
Travis Patr- Travis Patrick McElroy.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.560
That was the only good thing left.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.240
That was the only good thing left.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.840
And you just took that from me, Travis Patrick McElroy.

49:21.840 --> 49:25.120
It's all Pissed Beards and Pooh Corner here this week.

49:25.120 --> 49:26.720
This is the worst show ever.

49:27.280 --> 49:27.680
Fuck.

49:29.040 --> 49:32.080
It was the only good thing left.

49:32.080 --> 49:34.960
The only source of pure joy in this fucking world.

49:35.760 --> 49:36.800
Oh my god.

49:39.120 --> 49:42.960
They can't invent good things fast enough for us to ruin them.

49:42.960 --> 49:46.480
God.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.360
I gotta call- I gotta call Kellogg's up.

49:51.680 --> 49:53.440
You need to up your output, dog.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.800
Okay, Travis.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.680
I want you- this is not a joke.

49:58.560 --> 50:03.680
I want you to find the contact information for Kenny Loggins.

50:03.680 --> 50:05.840
Probably his management, okay?

50:05.840 --> 50:08.400
I want you to find the contact information for Kenny Loggins

50:08.400 --> 50:12.080
and I want you to write him an apology for what you did.

50:12.080 --> 50:13.120
I will do this.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.000
I want you to apologize to Kenny Loggins.

50:16.960 --> 50:19.760
You can use our pod- 30 million people listen to this fucking thing

50:19.760 --> 50:23.360
is gonna get a lot more draw than any change.org petition ever will.

50:23.360 --> 50:26.720
I want you to use this as your platform and I need you to start right now.

50:26.720 --> 50:29.680
Travis, right now I want you to go to Twitter

50:30.240 --> 50:33.760
and I want you to type period at Kenny Loggins

50:33.760 --> 50:36.160
and I want you to write an apology to him right now.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.640
And then I want you to read it on our show to our massive fan base.

50:39.680 --> 50:40.880
I want you to tweet that right now

50:40.880 --> 50:43.280
because I want people to see it without even knowing what you did

50:43.280 --> 50:44.480
and then it'll make sense later.

50:44.480 --> 50:48.320
I want you to tweet your apology to Kenny Loggins right this second

50:48.320 --> 50:50.800
saying I'm sorry for ruining your song on my hit show.

50:51.440 --> 50:52.320
Please retweet.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.440
Make sure you actually use our at nbmbam

50:55.440 --> 50:58.000
because that's gonna get- if he retweets that, oh my god.

50:58.960 --> 51:02.960
While Travis is apologizing to Kenny Loggins, we should wrap up, I think.

51:03.920 --> 51:05.360
We should wrap up our program.

51:08.080 --> 51:09.680
Max Fun Week is coming up.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.760
This is very exciting.

51:11.760 --> 51:14.960
It's been a big time for Max Fun these past couple weeks.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.280
We just added three new goddamn shows.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.480
Do you remember when they added Us

51:18.480 --> 51:21.280
and we were like the first one they had in like 14 years?

51:21.280 --> 51:22.880
And now they're just like all the time.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.720
But these aren't throwaway podcasts.

51:24.720 --> 51:27.440
These are fucking phenomenal podcasts that we've added.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.280
Yeah, not junk podcasts like ours

51:29.280 --> 51:32.240
where we just talk about nonsense and apologize to Kenny Loggins.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.080
These podcasts are not-

51:34.080 --> 51:37.920
Dear Mr. Loggins, sorry for implying that Back to Pooh Corner is about butts.

51:37.920 --> 51:40.400
Please forgive me. Hashtag nbmbam.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.800
Oh, that was perfectly organized.

51:44.640 --> 51:48.080
These new podcasts are definitely not all piss beards and Pooh Corner.

51:48.080 --> 51:48.560
It is.

51:49.680 --> 51:53.280
These are tremendous podcasts and some of them aren't even new.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.800
Let's talk about the Flophouse.

51:54.800 --> 51:58.480
That cannot be our featured show of the week.

51:59.440 --> 52:03.280
I feel ashamed that I hadn't listened to it before we picked it up.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.400
But fuck me, I listened to it my whole-

52:06.400 --> 52:09.280
I just got back from Chicago, had a really shitty day

52:09.280 --> 52:11.840
where like two flights got canceled out from under me.

52:11.840 --> 52:14.720
But it's okay because I had these good, good goofs in my ear.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.640
Go listen to the Flophouse. It's a good one.

52:16.640 --> 52:19.920
Also, go listen to Baby Geniuses and Destination DIY.

52:21.440 --> 52:23.520
You're gonna love these new shows. I guarantee it.

52:24.080 --> 52:25.360
And you know, while you're at it-

52:25.360 --> 52:27.920
Go listen to the other shows that you don't already listen to

52:27.920 --> 52:29.440
and they'll be new to you.

52:29.440 --> 52:34.240
I'm coming up on an episode of Lady to Lady that I think not this week, but next week.

52:34.240 --> 52:37.360
It might be the 15th or the 16th, but they're great.

52:37.360 --> 52:39.600
And if you've never listened to the show, go treat yourself.

52:39.600 --> 52:41.520
Go treat yourself. Also, go listen to Bullseye.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.480
Justin's on that one.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.080
Travis, blast me through- what?

52:46.640 --> 52:48.240
What did I say? I said Bullseye, didn't I?

52:49.040 --> 52:50.880
It's phonetically similar to Sawbones.

52:51.520 --> 52:56.160
All right. Travis, why don't you blast through the schedule of Max Fun Week?

52:56.160 --> 52:57.600
Okay, here's what we're looking at.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.280
We didn't really set up Max Fun Week,

52:59.280 --> 53:01.280
so why don't we talk about what it actually- with the fucking-

53:01.280 --> 53:02.160
I don't understand that.

53:02.160 --> 53:07.680
Okay, so Max Fun Week is just kind of like a community building exercise.

53:07.680 --> 53:10.000
It's saying, hey, we're not asking for money.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.720
We're not asking for anything from you.

53:12.720 --> 53:17.040
We just want you to feel more like a part of the community, the Max Fun community.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.640
So it's an excuse to get you to listen to shows you maybe haven't checked out yet

53:20.640 --> 53:23.840
and maybe just kind of reach out and make a new connection.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.080
And so we have a whole schedule of fun events.

53:27.680 --> 53:30.960
So it starts Wednesday, October 15th, Max Fun Trivia Day.

53:30.960 --> 53:33.840
How deep does your Max Fun trivia knowledge go?

53:33.840 --> 53:38.480
They'll be posting trivia questions on the Max Fun HQ Twitter account,

53:38.480 --> 53:40.080
and the first person to answer each question

53:40.080 --> 53:42.800
will get entered in a drawing for like prizes and shit.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.120
So make sure you're following Max Fun HQ

53:45.120 --> 53:48.240
and make sure you're paying attention on Wednesday.

53:48.880 --> 53:52.640
On Thursday, it's all about leaving reviews on iTunes

53:52.640 --> 53:55.040
and checking out shows maybe you haven't checked out before

53:55.040 --> 53:58.080
and then writing a nice review or liking someone else's review

53:58.080 --> 54:01.920
and just kind of getting the word out, building up our, you know, our base

54:01.920 --> 54:03.280
and our brand and all that shit.

54:04.400 --> 54:09.280
Friday, October 17th is, well, this one's pretty awesome, you guys.

54:09.280 --> 54:12.160
Basically, they'll post an audio clip

54:12.160 --> 54:16.000
of one of Judge John Hodgeman's signature interpretations on Twitter,

54:16.000 --> 54:17.840
and it's up to you to guess the reference.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.640
And the first correct answer gets entered in a drawing for a prize.

54:20.640 --> 54:21.360
So that's fun.

54:21.920 --> 54:22.800
You're John Hodgeman.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.000
How about this next one, though?

54:24.880 --> 54:26.880
Oh, this one's all about the base.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.960
Chill. All about that base.

54:29.760 --> 54:32.720
The butts of the music, because you have to fucking clarify.

54:32.720 --> 54:33.920
It's about butt music.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.320
Okay.

54:34.320 --> 54:37.040
On Saturday, October 18th, here's your challenge.

54:37.680 --> 54:39.920
You got to draw the Adventure Zone Adventures.

54:40.800 --> 54:43.680
So you can, who can, basically,

54:43.680 --> 54:45.840
in case you for some reason haven't heard it yet,

54:45.840 --> 54:48.800
we did an episode of this show that you're listening to now.

54:48.800 --> 54:49.600
Were you about to say-

54:49.600 --> 54:51.280
Were you about to read that copy about us?

54:51.280 --> 54:54.240
Who can forget that dumb shit that they did that one time?

54:54.240 --> 54:57.600
Basically, what we're looking for is some kind of visual representation,

54:57.600 --> 55:00.320
whether it's like drawing or painting or sculpting or whatever

55:01.040 --> 55:02.960
of the characters that we played in D&D.

55:03.680 --> 55:06.560
And the person who does the best one, the winning artist,

55:06.560 --> 55:12.000
will get a signed D&D Player's Handbook 5th edition signed by all of us.

55:12.000 --> 55:12.960
All the brothers.

55:12.960 --> 55:13.920
We should probably do that.

55:14.480 --> 55:15.920
Yeah, we'll like get on that and shit.

55:16.640 --> 55:17.200
We'll do it.

55:17.200 --> 55:18.000
We'll like do it.

55:18.960 --> 55:20.160
Boy, I miss the Adventure Zone.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.120
I wish we did more of that.

55:21.760 --> 55:22.640
I wish we had recorded some.

55:22.640 --> 55:23.840
I wish we had recorded more of that.

55:23.840 --> 55:24.340
Jesus.

55:26.240 --> 55:30.880
It just seems like poor foresight for us to start a grand campaign

55:30.880 --> 55:32.480
and then not follow through.

55:32.480 --> 55:33.200
Yeah.

55:33.200 --> 55:37.360
And then on Sunday, it's all about scheduling meetups in your hometown.

55:37.360 --> 55:39.120
Make sure to let people know about it.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.280
Monday, share your favorite episode.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.480
Tell all your friends about it.

55:42.480 --> 55:45.440
Make a post on Facebook or on Reddit or on Twitter.

55:46.160 --> 55:49.200
And then Tuesday is the Max Fun Rocket Coloring Contest.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.200
They'll post a line drawing of the Max Fun Signature Rocket

55:53.200 --> 55:56.000
and then you color it, decorate it, whatever you want to do.

55:58.400 --> 56:00.800
And then the favorite will win a prize.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.480
So lots of chances to win prizes.

56:02.480 --> 56:03.840
Hang out with people.

56:03.840 --> 56:05.760
Get involved and do some shit.

56:05.760 --> 56:08.960
It's not about anything other than just like celebrating you fine folks

56:09.600 --> 56:11.120
for listening to our shows.

56:11.120 --> 56:14.800
There's going to be a schedule posted on the Max Fun Facebook group

56:14.800 --> 56:16.800
on the Reddit Max Fun thing.

56:16.800 --> 56:18.800
If you follow Max Fun HQ on Twitter,

56:18.800 --> 56:21.520
you're going to get all of the information.

56:21.520 --> 56:25.520
There's also going to be some fun crossovers.

56:25.520 --> 56:28.160
And for our Max Fun episode, our Max Fun Week episode,

56:28.160 --> 56:29.360
we have a very special guest.

56:29.360 --> 56:30.880
We're very excited about this.

56:30.880 --> 56:32.560
Not only is he like an amazing dude,

56:32.560 --> 56:34.960
but he's like super cool and we're really happy.

56:34.960 --> 56:37.120
We're going to be joined by John Hodgman himself.

56:37.680 --> 56:39.760
Who is going to be pleased when he finds out

56:39.760 --> 56:42.320
that we think he's amazing and super cool.

56:42.320 --> 56:44.560
Yeah, so if you guys want to let him know

56:44.560 --> 56:46.880
that we think he's a super cool dude,

56:48.160 --> 56:51.200
make sure, so if you're listening to this today,

56:51.200 --> 56:55.760
on Monday, then you need to send us some desperate questions ASAP

56:56.880 --> 56:58.960
and then get them answered by John Hodgman.

56:59.760 --> 57:02.880
That'll be very exciting and intimidating and terrifying,

57:02.880 --> 57:05.600
but mostly we probably won't be funny at all.

57:05.600 --> 57:06.640
I'm scared about it.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.400
Every guest that we've had on the show has been more entertaining

57:10.400 --> 57:11.920
and charming and funny and smart than us.

57:12.480 --> 57:13.440
So this is nothing new.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.200
Cool.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.160
That's Max Fun Week.

57:18.160 --> 57:18.960
It's going to be great.

57:18.960 --> 57:21.040
It's going to be a good, good time.

57:21.040 --> 57:23.360
I actually won't be in America for it,

57:23.360 --> 57:26.000
but maybe I'll do a Japanese Max Fun Week.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.600
Maybe I'll try and spread the seed over there.

57:27.600 --> 57:31.840
Our Japanese listener base is not as big as I need it to be.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.680
So plant the seed.

57:34.320 --> 57:36.400
Thanks to people tweeting about the show like Rick Sammy,

57:37.120 --> 57:40.480

And so many others who are tweeting about it

58:00.400 --> 58:02.560
and we really appreciate it.

58:03.200 --> 58:03.600
Thank you.

58:03.600 --> 58:04.880
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winter

58:04.880 --> 58:05.600
to introduce our theme song.

58:05.600 --> 58:07.520
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.800
It is, guys, we talk about it all the time,

58:10.800 --> 58:12.080
but it really is so, so good.

58:12.960 --> 58:16.160
I was listening to it while I was landing yesterday

58:16.160 --> 58:18.640
and it put me in a very wistful, intensive mood.

58:18.640 --> 58:20.160
Also, thanks to naturebox.com.

58:20.160 --> 58:23.200

58:32.400 --> 58:33.520
I love you to my wife.

58:33.520 --> 58:35.200
Today is our one year wedding anniversary.

58:35.200 --> 58:35.840
Holy shit.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.480
Congratulations.

58:38.480 --> 58:38.800
You did it.

58:38.800 --> 58:40.080
Happy anniversary, Travis.

58:40.080 --> 58:40.560
Thank you.

58:41.920 --> 58:42.800
That's going to do it for us.

58:42.800 --> 58:44.320
She doesn't listen to the show.

58:44.320 --> 58:45.360
Well, no, why would she?

58:45.360 --> 58:46.480
To my brother, my brother, me, Griffin.

58:46.480 --> 58:47.280
Do you have a final Yahoo?

58:47.280 --> 58:48.320
Sure, I got a good one.

58:48.320 --> 58:51.760
This final Yahoo was sent in by Laura Sasha or Sacha.

58:51.760 --> 58:52.480
Thank you, Lauren.

58:52.480 --> 58:56.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jackson, who asks,

58:58.480 --> 59:00.560
how did DMX's voice get like that?

59:02.960 --> 59:04.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:06.560 --> 59:07.760
This is my brother, my brother, me.

59:07.760 --> 59:08.400
Kiss your dad.

59:08.400 --> 59:18.000
Square on the lips.

I'm Rhea Butcher.

59:36.800 --> 59:37.920

59:37.920 --> 59:40.000
And we are the cast members.

59:40.000 --> 59:40.320
What?

59:40.320 --> 59:40.960
I don't know.

59:40.960 --> 59:44.560
Podcastiness of Wham Bam Pow.

59:44.560 --> 59:47.360
That's an action sci-fi movie podcast

59:47.360 --> 59:50.320
you can find on Maximumfun.org or on iTunes.

59:50.320 --> 59:51.520
And what do we do?

59:51.520 --> 59:53.120
News reviews and things you can use.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.240
Tons of things you can use.

59:54.240 --> 59:57.680
We break it down so it can forever be broken.

59:57.680 --> 59:58.960
Hilarious jokes.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.560
Plus, sometimes there's a dog in the studio.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.840
Sometimes there's a dog here.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:13.040
We'll see you in your earbuds.
