00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.920 --> 00:52.000
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.320
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. Griffin and Justin are away. They're traveling

00:58.320 --> 01:04.080
about this great world of ours, exploring new adventures. I don't know. I think they're working.

01:04.080 --> 01:09.840
I don't really pay attention when they talk. But this is our best of episodes. It's episode

01:09.840 --> 01:17.280
82 to 91, so we're getting close to that 100 episode mark. We hope you enjoy it. It includes

01:17.280 --> 01:22.960
a lot of my favorite bits, including Dwarf and Cake Boss and a bunch of good ones. So I hope

01:22.960 --> 01:33.680
you'll like it. And yeah, here you go. Enjoy. Who has this much time? You know, when I last

01:33.680 --> 01:37.840
updated my status update, when I want people to know that I did something cool, that's the only

01:37.840 --> 01:41.760
time that you should ever update your status or twitter or anything. If you're doing something

01:41.760 --> 01:45.360
cooler than somebody else might be doing that exact second, that's when you tweet. Or you're

01:45.360 --> 01:49.200
making something good for dinner. Over half of my status updates just say,

01:49.200 --> 01:56.080
check out this thing I did. That's basically it. I made this. I made this thing. Okay, and as much

01:56.080 --> 02:00.560
as I hate people that are just like, I went to the store today, what I really hate is those ones

02:00.560 --> 02:06.800
that are like, a, you know, a true friend will do this, but a dear friend, and I'm just like,

02:06.800 --> 02:10.800
fuck you. You know, that's people that don't actually have friends. Can you give me, can you

02:10.800 --> 02:14.240
give me an example of what you mean, Travis? Oh, you're gonna have to give me a second. I'd love

02:14.240 --> 02:18.240
an example too. I would love this. You're gonna have to give me a second. No, no, no. I would

02:18.240 --> 02:27.680
love it just like straight off the dome freestyle. Uh, I don't know. Oh God, give me a fuck. So like,

02:27.680 --> 02:32.240
a true friend will drive you to the airport. A dear friend will fly the plane.

02:32.240 --> 02:43.680
A good guy will get you flowers. The right guy will eat them for you. Eat these flowers. Prove

02:43.680 --> 02:48.960
you love me. Eat these rhododendrons. Prove your love and eat the rhododendrons. Eat them, David.

02:49.520 --> 02:55.280
Bite the rose. Bite the rose, David. Bite the rose, David. Um, what if our dreams are just

02:55.280 --> 02:59.680
blurred memories of our previous lives? What? These are all coming to us from Yahoo Answers

02:59.680 --> 03:06.960
user Los Pumas, who, uh, is really turned out about 60 of these. Okay. Dear parents,

03:06.960 --> 03:11.600
just because it's your house doesn't mean it's not my privacy. Sincerely, teens.

03:15.360 --> 03:26.000
Is this guy 45? Teens. Teens. Guess what? It does mean that. It means it. It means it all over.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.160
Teens. That's our new sign off for my brother. My brother and me. Kiss your dad's green lips

03:30.160 --> 03:40.640
is gone. Teens is it. Oh my God. There's websites that generate Facebook statuses for you. Oh, no,

03:40.640 --> 03:49.280
teens. Now I have a virus. Uh, this is an advice show for the modern era. We're going to get to

03:49.280 --> 03:54.400
the advice in just a second. But first, some lady in this audience has a secret about these two.

03:54.400 --> 04:01.520
Oh. Yes, it's true. She knows who she is. She is probably too ashamed to admit it. Um,

04:01.520 --> 04:08.480
when I get nervous pre-show, and I always do, uh, I gotta make peeps. And sometimes I have to use

04:08.480 --> 04:12.480
the one closest to the green room, which in this case was the ladies room. We didn't want to,

04:12.480 --> 04:16.560
I guess, ruin the magic of the show by exposing ourselves to the audience. Uh, there were two

04:16.560 --> 04:22.960
stalls in there. Travis and I agree on peep procedure. We both went in, went in both stalls.

04:22.960 --> 04:30.560
There she is. There she is. Okay. Normally I would apologize, but you did not follow the

04:30.560 --> 04:33.440
bathroom procedure. You didn't take all the handle. Didn't knock on the door. She didn't

04:33.440 --> 04:40.000
expect there to be two dudes. You always have to expect two dudes. You always expect two dudes in

04:40.000 --> 04:45.360
the bathroom. This is a classy show. She shouldn't have to expect two dudes hanging out crossing the

04:45.360 --> 04:55.280
streams. There were two different stalls. We did pause in the middle and switch stalls,

04:57.520 --> 05:01.280
but that's just so we could get the full experience. And I giggled in the middle of the

05:01.280 --> 05:06.880
act, like, cause it was so ridiculous to do it. And we high-fived as we were passing. That part's

05:06.880 --> 05:11.200
not true. I definitely giggled though. And I couldn't just, was I giggling when you came in?

05:11.200 --> 05:18.080
Cause that would, God, God damn it. I think it's rid of the pre-show jitters,

05:18.080 --> 05:21.600
like supreme embarrassment. Yeah. That's a, that's a deep shame.

05:23.520 --> 05:31.680
God damn it. No, my dad reads those. The jig is up. Oh man.

05:31.680 --> 05:41.360
Um, okay. So, uh, he says I'm a Grinch. It doesn't matter what holiday it is.

05:41.360 --> 05:45.440
Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, 4th of July. He did not include candle nights,

05:45.440 --> 05:50.800
but I'm assuming or anything else. Just can't get excited for him. Want to get excited,

05:50.800 --> 05:56.800
enjoy the holidays, but just can't seem to. How can I stop being a Grinch? Like things.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.240
Okay. Normally we try to cut a little deeper to the bone here on our show,

06:00.240 --> 06:04.000
but I guess like things is a, is a perfectly suitable answer.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.160
Like every holiday, like Columbus day and like Canadian Thanksgiving and stuff.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.400
What about Independence day? Maybe they all the aliens.

06:14.080 --> 06:19.600
Can you not eat super fruit gummies during the show? Sorry. You sound like my,

06:19.600 --> 06:26.080
this is my chaw addicted brother, Griffin. He loves two things, bad advice and smokeless tobacco.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.760
Um, no, but really Independence day, not a fan of that. It's just fireworks and hot dogs. How can

06:31.760 --> 06:35.920
you not get into things exploding? And also there are hot dogs there. Is every day of your life a

06:35.920 --> 06:41.200
holiday? Are you Tim McGraw live like it was like I was dying style every day out there,

06:41.200 --> 06:45.920
skydiving, rock and mountain climbing? No. Well, you're here. So I can tell that's not true.

06:45.920 --> 06:53.520
Wow. What do you have? Let me say this. Do you have anything against them or is it just like,

06:53.520 --> 06:57.920
eh, I don't feel it. Oh, welcome to adulthood.

07:00.560 --> 07:05.520
Guess what? Nothing's as good as it used to be. You turn like 16 and people stop giving you candy

07:05.520 --> 07:10.480
and sparklers and it's sad from now on. Yeah. You have to, but then you have to drink chillers and

07:10.480 --> 07:17.600
five hour energy drinks just to feel. Yeah. We have a cure for your problem. It's called alcohol.

07:18.320 --> 07:23.040
Get on the bus. What I found in my adult life is all the holidays that I loved as a kid,

07:23.040 --> 07:28.000
like Halloween and Christmas and stuff. I had to give those up to appreciate holidays,

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
like St. Patrick's day. Sacrifice a few holidays so that the other ones mean more.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.840
No, I'm just saying like, I've learned to appreciate. I don't have to go to work today days

07:37.840 --> 07:43.680
and I get to drink all day. How do you not like those days? What's wrong with you?

07:44.800 --> 07:48.720
I think you're too broken for our help, but sir, I'm sorry. You will be issued a full refund.

07:50.960 --> 07:51.520
You were not.

07:55.840 --> 08:01.040
I have a Yahoo. A Yahoo, you say? I have Yahoo Answers. From the Yahoo Answers service. From

08:01.040 --> 08:05.280
the Yahoo Answers platform. Okay. That was developed. I can't stop drinking it even though

08:05.280 --> 08:12.160
I know it's like an experiment now. It's like mouth art for your mouth. This one was sent in

08:12.160 --> 08:18.080
by Alethea Eckhart. Thank you, Alethea. It's by Yahoo Answers user Nevaeh, who asks,

08:18.080 --> 08:24.240
have it backwards. Hey everybody, by the way, cheese it with that. All right. Unless your name

08:24.240 --> 08:30.400
is Nevaeh and you're here, in which case it's lovely. Who asks, what can I get a horse and dog

08:30.400 --> 08:35.760
for Christmas? We're having a Christmas party on this Saturday and we're doing Secret Santa

08:35.760 --> 08:41.680
and I got a horse named Daisy and a dog named Bandit, which Bandit is kind of old and only

08:41.680 --> 08:47.200
has 20% vision. So I can't really get him toys. So what else can I get a dog that only has 20%

08:47.200 --> 08:58.320
vision? Euthanasia. And what do you buy a horse for Christmas besides treats? Horse treats,

08:58.320 --> 09:05.120
apples, sugar. Hey, guess what? That's the only thing that horses give a shit about and not being,

09:05.920 --> 09:11.600
those three things and not being kicked in the sides. Those are the four things the horse is

09:11.600 --> 09:17.200
like. I got you this necklace of roses. I like oats and not having a man on me.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.240
Maybe you could get him a smaller horse and a smaller dog. But you know what? Even those

09:24.240 --> 09:29.760
horses give a shit about holidays. Just saying. Hey, just saying. Get it together. They get a

09:29.760 --> 09:35.280
little extra trot in their gallop right around Thanksgiving and stuff. I don't know what horses

09:35.280 --> 09:43.680
like anymore. In my day, horses, they appreciated the simpler things like Smucker's Raspberry

09:43.680 --> 09:48.960
Preserve. I used to have my finger on the equestrian pulse and nowadays I just feel so divorced from

09:48.960 --> 09:53.840
it. You know what you could do? You could get the horse a dog present and the dog a horse present

09:53.840 --> 09:58.960
and then they swap them, Gifted and Magi, and they become best friends. That's not how Gifted

09:58.960 --> 10:06.480
and Magi work. Thanks for the watch chain, it's yours now. Gifted the lazy guy. Swapperoo. News

10:06.480 --> 10:10.960
flash, if you're a horse, you don't fucking know that. Take it for granted. Somebody tells you to

10:10.960 --> 10:16.880
run in a circle, you're like, okay boss. I guess, thanks. I hope I get oats for this. We've gone,

10:16.880 --> 10:20.400
I don't know, five minutes without addressing the fact that someone got a horse and a dog and a

10:20.400 --> 10:27.200
Secret Santa. What kind of fucking Secret Santa is this? What kind of Secret Santa is there where

10:27.200 --> 10:33.600
you draw a human being saying like, oh, whoo, shots to blood there. Someone that wears shoes

10:33.600 --> 10:38.000
and pants and stuff. Yeah, I got the short straw, looks like I got the horse. Good news, you can

10:38.000 --> 10:43.840
give the straw to the horse. You will enjoy that very much. Why is your response not, this is a

10:43.840 --> 10:50.560
horse. I think there's been a clarifying error. You have written Bandit. No, I entered the human Secret

10:50.560 --> 10:57.520
Santa. I'm a human and I have a horse. Is the horse and dog draw names? What the fuck is that

10:57.520 --> 11:02.880
horse gonna get? All I got is these shoes, they're like an apple. Do you want this eaten apple?

11:03.600 --> 11:08.320
Steven the human isn't gonna like this apple. Bad news for Dorothy and accounting,

11:08.320 --> 11:14.000
you're not getting anything. Don't even buy a gift, you're going home empty-handed.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.960
Here's a Yahoo that has nothing to do with snooze. It's by Yahoo Answers, sent in by

11:22.960 --> 11:26.720
Nefariosity. Thank you Nefariosity. It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks,

11:26.720 --> 11:45.280
what do angels eat for my book? How to cook for angels. I'd read it. I would, I'd read it.

11:45.280 --> 11:50.800
That Shiner Buck is so good after drinking that orange jizz for 30 minutes. That's because it's

11:50.800 --> 12:02.640
made here in Austin. I am writing a book and the girl in my book is pregnant with an angel

12:02.640 --> 12:07.280
and I want her to have something to crave. Unfortunately, it's a biography.

12:10.320 --> 12:14.400
You're not writing a book, let's be honest. You're justifying to your dad.

12:14.400 --> 12:20.960
Yeah, daddy it's an angel. Trust me, it's an angel baby. I'm trying to win a bet with my stupid

12:20.960 --> 12:29.280
friends. What do angels eat? Two different people in the Yahoo Answers platform wrote angel food

12:29.280 --> 12:36.800
cake. Good one guys. Nobody said angel hair pasta. Could get another angel based. What about devil's

12:36.800 --> 12:44.560
food cake? Can you believe it? Travis, if you make the jokes that are as bad as the jokes that are in

12:44.560 --> 12:47.760
there, then people don't have to listen. No, I said it in a tone of voice like I'm mocking them,

12:47.760 --> 12:52.240
but it's all I could come up with. If we just had bad jokes snidely for 30 minutes, would you guys

12:52.240 --> 12:59.520
be cool? I think like anything. I guess anything they want to. Obviously their teeth are made of

12:59.520 --> 13:10.240
metal. Angels I pretty sure only eat cloud-based foods. So like cloud burgers. Like cloud burgers

13:10.240 --> 13:14.960
mostly. Right. Did they eat like tacos? Cloud tacos. They can eat cloud tacos. They're not

13:16.640 --> 13:23.280
exclusively towards cloud burgers. There's a lot of cloud-based foods in this situation that I'm

13:23.280 --> 13:29.760
whipping up live on stage. Griffin's out there on a bold new frontier and he's writing the rules.

13:29.760 --> 13:35.200
They'll keep challenging me on this. What about cupcakes? God damn it. Yeah, they eat those too,

13:35.200 --> 13:40.880
but they're made of clouds. In this situation I'm creating. What about- Have you guys ever seen

13:40.880 --> 13:48.240
improv before? This is how it works. Normally we record for an hour and 15 minutes. You get a 55

13:48.240 --> 13:52.640
minute show and these are the gems you're missing out on. If you could believe it, you would be robbed

13:52.640 --> 13:58.320
of cloud tacos. This is my brother, my brother, me, face to face, three, Tokyo Drift, the cutting

13:58.320 --> 14:04.960
room floor. Do angels have to- Do angels- Let me bring it down. Do angels have to- Things are

14:04.960 --> 14:12.240
getting too funny. Let's have a really intense theological discussion. What do you guys think

14:12.240 --> 14:19.520
about angels? If I get to heaven- Taking all comers. When I get to heaven and I become an angel,

14:19.520 --> 14:24.480
because I think I did a pretty good job down here. Pretty sure that's how it works. I don't

14:24.480 --> 14:30.960
want to have to have the onus of eating on me. Angels only eat because they're hungry, because

14:30.960 --> 14:40.640
then actually angels only eat to take food away from poor people. This is mine. This isn't made

14:40.640 --> 14:50.240
of clouds. I hate it. This one was sent in by Krista Whelan. Thank you, Krista. It's by Yahoo

14:50.240 --> 14:54.400
Answers. God. I know, she sent in link 30. It's by Yahoo Answers user Mycroft who asks,

14:54.400 --> 14:59.760
what are some awkward places to hang mistletoe? Belt buckle. Gallows. Funny, awkward, uncomfortable,

14:59.760 --> 15:08.640
or bizarre places to hang mistletoe? Shanks. On the top of the coffin. Oh man. What? It's Christmas.

15:08.640 --> 15:16.640
Yeah. Oh gosh. The top of the speculum? I don't know what that means. Okay. What's a funny,

15:16.640 --> 15:23.280
awkward place to hang- You know what I really like? On your belt buckle. That's hysterical.

15:23.280 --> 15:28.240
No, I already said that one. We know. We're commenting on the comedy. Belt buckles was good.

15:28.240 --> 15:32.960
Yeah. What about on the back of the belt loop of your pants so it looks like you're saying,

15:32.960 --> 15:39.120
kiss my fanny. That's what I reduced it for candle lights. You have to say fanny? Now just

15:39.120 --> 15:43.520
so you know, Griffin, in many countries that aren't America, fanny means something completely

15:43.520 --> 15:48.320
different. Is that true? Yeah. I didn't know that. What does it mean? That's darty. I don't want to

15:48.320 --> 15:52.880
know about it because it's candle lights. No, you don't. All right. What about anywhere? Anywhere

15:52.880 --> 15:57.280
in the world? Anywhere that you hang mistletoe is always awkward and terrible. Guys, have you ever

15:57.280 --> 16:05.760
been- We've all been on this planet for between 28 and 31 years. No, 25 years, right? 24. That's

16:05.760 --> 16:09.760
okay. It's Christmas. You don't know my age. That's all I want. I asked you for Christmas for

16:10.640 --> 16:17.440
a card. A birth certificate. I wanted you and Obama to give me a birth certificate for Christmas.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.040
Have you guys ever been to a Christmas party or gathering or somebody's house where there was

16:23.040 --> 16:31.760
actually mistletoe on display? Yes, but not until recently. I went to a party and I walked into the

16:31.760 --> 16:35.440
kitchen. Hold on, wait. This story sounds like it's going to be long. Will it also be funny?

16:35.440 --> 16:41.760
Yeah. It's very short. Is it linked to humor? Let me assuage your fears. It's very short,

16:41.760 --> 16:49.600
but not funny. Okay, break on through then. I walked into the kitchen and looked up and there

16:49.600 --> 16:55.280
was mistletoe hanging in the middle of the room and around the perimeter of the room were eight

16:55.280 --> 17:03.840
guys looking really uncomfortable waiting for a girl to walk into the room. What are you doing?

17:03.840 --> 17:10.160
Look up. You got me. Get some chapstick. Get your birch bees. It's smidgen time.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.600
Maybe this was a fever dream, but I feel like I went to a boy-girl party in middle school

17:17.600 --> 17:23.200
where mistletoe was hung aloft from the rafters like something that you hang from rafters.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.040
I think it's the most awkward thing in the world and I wish we would stop doing it.

17:27.040 --> 17:34.080
I've never been smooched. No, thanks to mistletoe. I don't think that's a real thing people are

17:34.080 --> 17:39.440
doing. Are there any good answers? The fifth street overpass. The end of my dog's tail.

17:39.440 --> 17:46.880
Whoa. That's awful. And last but certainly not least, on your mom. Okay, it was funny for a

17:46.880 --> 17:54.640
minute. What's it? Above the toilet. I like that actually. Kiss the toilet. Kiss that toilet before

17:54.640 --> 17:59.840
you use it. Hey everybody in mistletoe, you know that you don't just have to kiss whatever inanimate

17:59.840 --> 18:05.040
object home. It's not like a binding contract. That's what people said on your dad's wardrobe.

18:05.040 --> 18:11.040
The litter box on a table lamp. Light switch. Come here, light switch. Cassandra says,

18:11.040 --> 18:15.360
put it in the guy's locker room. Smiley face. I don't think that's going to play out how you

18:15.360 --> 18:21.200
think it's going to play out. Good game, Brock. Hey, Brick, come here. Did you just name them Brick

18:21.200 --> 18:30.080
and Brock? Hello, Brock. Hello, Brick. I guess we should have seen this coming. Christmas law

18:30.080 --> 18:35.120
binds us, Brick. I know, Brock. Why are we so adherent to it? Hey, good hockey. Come here.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.040
That's hockey sweater. Let me take it off of you. I want to kiss you under the mistletoe.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.400
Hey, what's going on in here? Get out of here, Brack. Get out of here, Brack. Brick and Brock

18:42.400 --> 18:47.840
are kissing. Come over here, Brick. You're cool. Brick, it's time for this kiss party. Guys,

18:47.840 --> 18:51.280
it's pronounced Bruce for the last time. It's Bruce. It's Bruce.

18:51.280 --> 19:02.480
This one was sent in by HorseLoverFat. Thanks, HorseLoverFat. It's by yahooanswersuser. Touch

19:02.480 --> 19:09.520
my pigtails and die, who asks, if you were a legitimate vampire, as 99% of the world is,

19:10.240 --> 19:15.680
who would you surprise with the gift of eternal life this Christmas? For me, it would be Bob from

19:15.680 --> 19:21.520
accounting. He has nice hair, and it deserves to look that way forever. Wow. A legitimate vampire.

19:23.360 --> 19:27.840
Not one of these fakie, not one of these fly-by-night, Johnny-come-lately vampires.

19:27.840 --> 19:31.200
Not one of these kids that go to the mall on a hot topic, and they bite the fangs,

19:31.200 --> 19:34.800
and they put them on their teeth, and they bite each other. Yeah. And then they get sick

19:34.800 --> 19:41.520
from the bites. From the bites and the Chinese-made fake fangs. They've made of lead,

19:41.520 --> 19:44.160
and you get sick from putting them in your mouth, and then from putting them in the neck.

19:44.160 --> 19:48.320
I don't know if I can say this or not, but I think I would give that eternal life to the pope.

19:48.880 --> 19:54.560
Make him forever pope. Oh, no. Really? You're enjoying John Ratzenberg that much?

19:56.400 --> 20:01.120
Enjoying John Ratzenberg that much that you're going to keep him as a turnip pope? I just kind

20:01.120 --> 20:05.680
of like the idea of forever pope. I feel like he could really get a lot done. That's impossible.

20:06.240 --> 20:11.120
Think about it. If he... None of us are Catholic, by the way. Go on. No, I'm not Catholic.

20:11.120 --> 20:17.600
I'm not. If you're a vampire, you can't... How is your day going to be? He wears a cross

20:17.600 --> 20:22.880
on his hat. It's going to be unpleasant. It's going to be unpleasant. It's a labor of love.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.680
I'm going to live forever, and I'm going to have migraines the whole time.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.360
Because there's a cross on my hat. Like, what are you talking about? The pope is the worst.

20:29.360 --> 20:33.600
I don't know anybody... His whole style is going to have to change. I mean, that's obvious.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.480
I don't know anybody with more day-to-day cross exposure than the pope.

20:36.480 --> 20:42.160
Okay, then I'm going to switch to David Boreanaz. Well, that's a little on the nose.

20:42.160 --> 20:46.480
Yeah, he's the pope of my heart. I know he can do it. I've seen him succeed

20:46.480 --> 20:50.400
as a vampire previously. You are the only one I know that can handle this power.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.320
I'm going to say Ellen. Why Ellen?

20:55.120 --> 21:01.040
Can you... Here's my reasoning. Can you imagine a world after Ellen, post Ellen, P.E.?

21:01.040 --> 21:06.160
Uh... Can you imagine the year one P.E.?

21:06.160 --> 21:09.600
I cannot, and I don't think the world could either. I don't want to imagine. I just want to

21:09.600 --> 21:13.280
see her dance, and she'll dance the whole show and never get tired because she's a vampire,

21:13.280 --> 21:16.880
and then she'll get angry at her guests who get tired. Because, like, when you're a vampire,

21:16.880 --> 21:21.680
you can pretty much dance forever. Can I do Robert Pattinson just as, like,

21:21.680 --> 21:23.120
payback? Surprise.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.480
Surprise. Now you live forever. Oh, what if you gave him eternal life and

21:26.480 --> 21:30.560
then immediately staked him through the heart? Just, like, right away. One-two punch.

21:30.560 --> 21:34.240
Well, that would just be... That would be murder. Or could you get it around the murder charge?

21:34.240 --> 21:36.640
Because that is undead. He was a vamp.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.000
Yeah. You cannot be tried for killing a vamp.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.440
Okay. That's true.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.880
Or a tramp. You can get one from a rail car.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.080
Or a scamp. Or a scamp. Get out of here. I'm going to tell you.

21:48.080 --> 21:52.560
Oh, now I've got it. I'm going to turn all of the rail riders, all of the lovable hobos,

21:52.560 --> 21:55.920
into vampires. Oh, my God. Hey, ABC,

21:55.920 --> 21:59.200
I will sell you the series that I just created about...

21:59.200 --> 22:02.400
Boxcar vampires....beautiful boxcar vampires that ride the

22:02.400 --> 22:04.480
rails at 40k. Boxcar trampires.

22:04.480 --> 22:08.320
Oh, tramp. Boxcar trampires. Boxcar trampires.

22:08.320 --> 22:14.240
What they'll do is they'll go around and have premarital sex, and then they'll... Some of them

22:14.240 --> 22:20.640
go to college. And some of them learn a little bit about love, but a lot about themselves.

22:20.640 --> 22:26.080
Yeah. And one of them is Neff Campbell. More like matronly, I think.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.680
I would have gone with Misha Barton, because she looks vampiric in the face region.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.520
She does, right? She looks hollow.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.800
Her and Tilda Swinton, I think, would be a good...

22:34.800 --> 22:37.440
Tilda Swinton can be her mom. Can we sign Tilda on?

22:37.440 --> 22:42.320
I'm not ready for TV. You get to play a boxcar vampire. Where do I sign?

22:43.040 --> 22:46.400
How many times do I have to sign to be a boxcar vampire?

22:46.400 --> 22:49.200
That is an undeniable role. I want you to know,

22:49.200 --> 22:52.160
that sounds like Russell Brand doing an impression of Tilda Swinton.

22:52.160 --> 22:56.320
How about Russell Brand, the vampire? What's he doing? Russell,

22:56.320 --> 22:58.160
he already looks like he lives in a boxcar.

22:58.160 --> 23:02.480
Whatever the opposite of eternal life is, I would like to give to Russell Brand.

23:03.760 --> 23:07.040
I would like to give him like 30 second life remaining.

23:07.040 --> 23:12.480
Have life. Just to see what he does. Only now do I know what it means to truly live.

23:17.040 --> 23:20.800
Here's the thing. In this day and age, people change jobs. Millennials.

23:20.800 --> 23:30.080
No one is tied to any one position anymore, which makes creating past work experience

23:30.080 --> 23:35.600
just the easiest thing. Pick a friend, write down their cell phone number,

23:35.600 --> 23:44.080
say they were the manager at the now defunct, etc. And then have the manager call them.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.360
Your friend will say whatever you tell them to.

23:45.360 --> 23:50.960
You know, have the manager call us. We'll say whatever you want.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.880
Yeah, I'll lie. I'll put a message.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.960
For five dollars, I'll tell them you were president.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.480
Is it possible that it's not like they're under qualified,

23:58.480 --> 24:01.280
like they don't have the years of experience, but they're under qualified,

24:01.280 --> 24:08.240
like it's a job as like an engineer or like as a surgeon and they just don't have any knowledge?

24:08.240 --> 24:10.080
Well, I fucking hope it's not a surgeon.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.760
Yeah, I would hope so too.

24:11.760 --> 24:16.400
I don't think the people who listen to our show are clinically unstable,

24:16.400 --> 24:18.160
which seems to be the picture that you're painting.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.160
Now, come in here, Dylan. What prepares you to be a marine biologist?

24:22.880 --> 24:23.680
Nothing.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.160
Nothing.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.600
Absolutely nothing.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.840
I like fish and I'm scared of water. Let's get this done.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.120
Let's learn some shit about otters.

24:31.120 --> 24:37.600
I got you. I got an underwater microscope. Come on. Science. Where's the whale?

24:38.400 --> 24:39.280
Where's the whale at?

24:39.920 --> 24:41.360
Which one's the shark again?

24:41.360 --> 24:42.560
Okay. Yeah, that's right.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.360
I want to put my microscope on a shark.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.320
I'm going to call in that big fish like Jonah did. Remember?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.400
I'm going to learn about his inside part.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.120
By the way, I only believe in sciences in the Bible. Let's do this. I'm unqualified.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.320
The Bible and Pinocchio.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.080
This is my dream.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.800
This is my dream, sir.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.640
This is my dream job. I fucking hate fish. I hate this. Let's do it.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.360
Come on, you slimy bitches.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.400
Look at him flop around on the table. This is crazy.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.440
Somebody get me a science knife. I'm going to go to town on this fish.

25:13.440 --> 25:17.280
Give me a science knife. I gots to cut this whale open.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.600
Tell you what, I'm not qualified for this job,

25:19.600 --> 25:24.240
but I'm going to dissect this octopus right in front of you. Watch. You watch. You watch.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.200
I'm going to cut off some squid legs, put it on this octopus,

25:27.200 --> 25:29.280
make the ultimate tentacle monster animal.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.440
Is this science yet? Did we do it?

25:33.440 --> 25:38.240
I want to do some science. Drop me in this tank. I'm going to tie this octopus' legs together like Popeye.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.800
Let's keep the food train rolling. This one was sent in by Galiayali. Thanks, Galiayali.

25:46.800 --> 25:52.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Hi? That's H-I-G-H and then a question mark.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.760
Who asks, yes?

25:55.760 --> 25:57.840
You're on Yahoo Answers, I'm going to assume.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.280
What do you do to make the most of your time?

26:01.280 --> 26:05.040
What do you do to make the lettuce on your sandwich feel sexy?

26:08.080 --> 26:10.080
Wait, uh-huh.

26:10.720 --> 26:16.960
The responses to this question really shows off that Yahoo Answers is just an Algonquin

26:16.960 --> 26:18.160
roundtable of comedy.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.440
Is there no more to the question?

26:21.440 --> 26:21.840
That's it.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.880
No, that's it. That's it.

26:22.880 --> 26:29.680
Uh, Megan responded, lay my meat on it real slow, then squirt mayo on it.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.680
Oh, God.

26:31.680 --> 26:38.560
I get it all wet, put it under water just to make it so much more important that the rest of the lettuce,

26:38.560 --> 26:43.680
when really I'm just trying to wash any bacteria off, then I get kinky with it and bite it.

26:43.680 --> 26:47.680
That got, that took a weird practical turn in the middle.

26:47.680 --> 26:53.040
Yo, girl, you know DDT and what all, and then I funk it.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.760
Dress it up in something sexy, not mayo.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.800
I can't enjoy it if it's dry unless it stays completely naked.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.560
Whisper naughty things to it.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.960
Put it in your mouth to bite it and suck on it.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.080
This is lettuce.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.880
Everybody, it's lettuce.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.960
Like, what's the matter with you?

27:10.960 --> 27:13.280
Let me suck on this sandwich, Fixins.

27:13.280 --> 27:18.480
I forgot, I've lost the place where it's Griffin and the Yahoo answer sings,

27:18.480 --> 27:21.840
and now I just think my brother's is awful, awful mess of humanity.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.280
Add salad cream.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.520
Oh, God.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.120
No, wait, hold on.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.280
Does it say add salad cream?

27:29.280 --> 27:33.440
Add salad cream in all caps and a smiley face at the end of it.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Hey, America, that's not even a thing.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.800
That's not a thing.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.920
You made up salad cream for your dumb joke.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.520
You mean salad dressing?

27:41.520 --> 27:43.920
Uh, a special secret sauce.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.000
Why are you, why are you jizzing on your sandwich?

27:48.720 --> 27:50.320
Why are you objectifying lettuce?

27:50.320 --> 27:51.120
Put that away.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.600
How about you just eat it?

27:53.600 --> 27:55.120
How about you just put it in your mouth?

27:55.120 --> 27:55.920
Cause lettuce.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.880
Hey, internet, stop what you're doing.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.960
Put down the mouse, open the front door and walk outside.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.320
And remember that you live in a real world with consequences for your actions.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.520
Call your dad.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.400
Call your dad.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.040
Just call him what you're doing right now.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.560
You're talking about fucking lettuce.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.080
Well, these sure are some hilarious bits, huh?

28:20.080 --> 28:20.400
Yeah.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.200
These bits, real top notch.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.680
I love them and you should too.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.520
But I wanted to take a quick time out to tell you about our sponsors this week.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.320
Couple of them I think you already know about.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.920
If you've listened to the show like ever before, you've probably heard of MeUndies.

28:35.920 --> 28:39.520
But MeUndies is a new way of doing underpants.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.000
And it's quite lovely, quite wonderful.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.640
Not only the patterns, but the execution.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.200
They're committed to making the world's most comfortable underwear.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.760
And as far as I'm concerned, they have done it.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.480
I wear MeUndies and you should too.

28:52.480 --> 28:56.560
Gird your loins with only the greatest underpants in town.

28:56.560 --> 29:01.120
And right now, they're offering 20% off your first order if you go to MeUndies.com

29:01.840 --> 29:02.640
my brother.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.040
And if you don't love them, your first pair is free.

29:05.040 --> 29:09.360
But that's completely unnecessary because you will love them because they are wonderful

29:09.360 --> 29:10.240
underpants.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.920
We also want to tell you about Naturebox.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.800
Naturebox, you know them.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.920
By this point, I'd be amazed if anybody's not already doing Naturebox.

29:17.920 --> 29:18.720
But you should be.

29:19.360 --> 29:24.320
From snacks like peanut butter nom-noms or sriracha cashews and Asiago cheese crisps,

29:24.320 --> 29:25.760
which are my favorite.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.040
Naturebox has over 100 delicious snacks to choose from.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.040
They can get delivered directly to your doorstep.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.680
They release brand new choices every single month.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.440
It's full of flavor, but without any of the junk, the stuff you don't want.

29:37.440 --> 29:43.920
So head to naturebox.com slash my brother and unbox a world of taste and possibility.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.920
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother, your first box of hand-picked snacks sent

directly to your doorstep.

29:49.280 --> 29:53.280
So trust me, if you haven't already tried it, you'll love it.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.520
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.480
We also want to tell you to check out Scolding the Winds.

29:58.480 --> 30:02.800
Riley is alone after being kicked out of her parents' house at 18, getting herself out

30:02.800 --> 30:06.640
of an abusive relationship and finding comfort only in her vices.

30:06.640 --> 30:10.800
She has no one left to count on, and when her feelings for a colleague begin to grow,

30:10.800 --> 30:15.760
Riley wonders if love is the answer to life's problems, or if it's just one more reason

30:15.760 --> 30:17.200
to pour another drink.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.000
Interested in religion, love, or advertising?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.360
Buy Scolding the Winds.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.120

I do.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.360
Well, let me tell you about this one.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.800
Sure, it's your basic cryptogram game, but with runes.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.360
Solve the puzzle by matching each rune to a letter.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.560

30:58.000 --> 31:02.960
Just go to iTunes app store and search for runic cryptogram.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.280
Runic, like tunic, but with an R.

31:05.280 --> 31:05.840
Go check it out.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.840
That sounds really cool and exactly the kind of app I love, so I'm going to check it out.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.720
I also have a message for Kate from Graham.

31:12.720 --> 31:17.760
10 years ago, you chose to marry a man with the same name as your brother, which is absolutely

31:17.760 --> 31:18.640
not weird.

31:18.640 --> 31:23.120
You loved him, fed him, and quietly made his ugly green pants disappear.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.480
Every day, I'm filled with joy and awe that you're my wife.

31:26.480 --> 31:31.760
Here's to the next 10 years of laughter, fashion errors, and whenever possible, naps.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.760
Sweet, sweet naps.

31:33.760 --> 31:37.840
That's awesome, Graham, and Kate sounds like a wonderful person, and it sounds like you're

31:37.840 --> 31:39.360
very lucky to have her, Graham.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.560
You're very lucky.

31:40.560 --> 31:41.520
You don't deserve her.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.040
She's way too good for you.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.960
But yeah, that's really great for you guys.

31:44.960 --> 31:45.920
Congratulations.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.440
And now, back to the show.

31:52.000 --> 31:52.640
I'm ready.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.440
Here comes Yahoo.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.960
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

31:54.960 --> 31:55.840
Thank you, Lisa.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user steveman3015.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.800
That's a pretty good username.

32:03.360 --> 32:03.840
Yeah.

32:03.840 --> 32:14.240
Who asks, what would happen if Uncle Jesse, in parentheses, John Stamos, from Full House,

32:14.240 --> 32:21.680
do, if he got shorted a nugget at McDonald's, say he orders a 20-piece nugget.

32:21.680 --> 32:25.920
He receives his order, he counts the nuggets, and he sees he only received 19 of them.

32:25.920 --> 32:26.560
What would he do?

32:28.720 --> 32:32.640
Now, this could just be a thought exercise that this guy is doing, but I would like to

32:32.640 --> 32:38.880
think that this man, Steveman, has been shorted a nugget, and he's like, I don't know what

32:38.880 --> 32:40.160
to do, and so I have to look.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.280
Where can I look for advice?

32:41.280 --> 32:44.080
Towards John Stamos, Uncle Jesse from Full House.

32:44.080 --> 32:51.520
His WWUJFFHD bracelet.

32:51.520 --> 32:56.160
I think that John Stamos would get really mad at the person behind the counter, but

32:56.160 --> 32:58.640
then, after a moment's thought, he would have mercy.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.100
Jesus.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.320
I think he would-

33:04.320 --> 33:04.880
Have mercy.

33:04.880 --> 33:05.760
Give me another nugget.

33:05.760 --> 33:12.960
I think he would get up, and he would leave the McDonald's restaurant, because he's-

33:12.960 --> 33:14.320
And remember that he's John fucking Stamos.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.320
He's John goddamn Stamos.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.160
Why the hell is he at McDonald's ordering chicken nuggets?

33:20.160 --> 33:20.720
Yeah.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.760
Who could name the original name of Full House?

33:24.960 --> 33:29.360
That's originally called House of Comics was the original bitch, and it was not a good

33:29.360 --> 33:29.600
name.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.680
Sourdough Sweethearts was the original name of the show.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.800
What's with all these dudes?

33:36.800 --> 33:37.300
Yeah.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.880
Yeah, you know what the weirdest thing about Full House is?

33:40.880 --> 33:45.760
If the mom wasn't dead, it would be the weirdest goddamn show on television.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.160
Hey, have you guys seen the new episode of Lazy Uncles?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.640
At one point, one of them was living in the living room.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.960
They just, like, strung up a sheet, and that was his bedroom.

33:56.960 --> 34:00.960
The theme song originally went, everywhere you look, there's an uncle.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.400
There are uncles fucking everywhere.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.640
And you know what's even weirder?

34:06.640 --> 34:08.800
Only Uncle Jesse was related by blood.

34:08.800 --> 34:09.600
Joey was just there.

34:09.600 --> 34:10.400
Just there!

34:10.400 --> 34:14.240
There's a fucking embarrassment of uncles in this household.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.600
A murder of uncles.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.000
That was actually the first title.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.480
The original title was A Murder of Uncles.

34:23.280 --> 34:28.960
Do you know that for seven years, Joey Gladstone would meet a woman at a bar and she would say,

34:28.960 --> 34:30.640
should we go back to your place?

34:30.640 --> 34:33.360
And he would say, I'm not sure that's a good idea.

34:33.360 --> 34:38.800
I live with my friend and his brother-in-law and his three daughters and my brother-in-law's

34:38.800 --> 34:40.960
wife and their twin sons and our dog.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.200
And Kimmy Gibbler from time to time.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.800
And Kimmy Gibbler occasionally.

34:44.800 --> 34:49.280
And also all of my puppets and Popeye toys.

34:49.280 --> 34:49.680
Right.

34:49.680 --> 34:53.120
And I have to record the Rush Hour Renegades to probably get going.

34:53.120 --> 34:56.400
You know, if that show were recorded today, Rush Hour Renegades would be a podcast, right?

34:56.400 --> 34:58.400
And I don't need the competition, frankly.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.360
That's true.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.960
And maybe the Smash Club?

35:00.960 --> 35:01.760
Is that it?

35:01.760 --> 35:02.320
The Smash Club?

35:02.320 --> 35:03.760
The Smash Club lives in their house?

35:04.880 --> 35:05.920
I thought so.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.400
I felt like that show was like some kind of horrific like MC Escher drawing where no one

35:10.400 --> 35:11.360
could escape the house.

35:11.920 --> 35:16.400
Like Uncle Jesse got married and had twins and they put him in the attic.

35:16.400 --> 35:16.880
Yeah.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.120
Well, like some kind of crazy aunt.

35:19.120 --> 35:26.320
Let's also remember that Jesse's last name changed midstream and no one commented on

35:26.320 --> 35:26.320
it.

35:26.320 --> 35:26.640
It did?

35:26.640 --> 35:29.360
So I'm not sure logic and reason hold sway in this.

35:29.360 --> 35:29.680
True.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.400
How do you know so fucking much about Full House Trilogy?

35:32.400 --> 35:36.320
It used to be Jesse Cochran, but John Stamos wanted something that sounded more Greek.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.640
So he picked the most Greek name that there is on the Earth.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.840
Guys, this Yahoo answer was sent in by Chuck Jones.

35:49.840 --> 35:50.720
Thanks, Chuck Jones.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.720
Oh, it's so good.

35:52.720 --> 36:03.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gary who asks, thongs for men, in parentheses, boy skins?

36:03.920 --> 36:07.520
Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew where the website boy skins is gone.

36:08.400 --> 36:12.560
I wanted to buy a thong form there, but saw they no longer wear up.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.440
I also wanted to buy my son one since he saw mine and wanted to try it.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.960
No, I'm not a pedo.

36:16.960 --> 36:19.440
He's 15 and can speak for himself, thanks.

36:19.440 --> 36:23.360
Thanks, does anyone know where I can buy adult and youth boy thongs?

36:23.360 --> 36:23.680
Thanks.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.160
Oh, God.

36:26.160 --> 36:30.480
Boy skins, if you couldn't tell from my pronunciation, does have a Z up on it.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.240
Is there a Y?

36:33.040 --> 36:33.920
No Y?

36:33.920 --> 36:34.560
There is a Y.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.000
I mean, at the end of boy, but not men skins, not mid skins.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.280
Oh, no, no, no, no.

36:39.280 --> 36:44.080
It would have been better if it was B-O-I-Skins-Z, but I was not so lucky.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.000
But trademark ever living.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.560
Mm-hmm, why is this a thing?

36:50.080 --> 36:51.120
Boy skins website?

36:51.840 --> 36:55.040
Everyone in the answers is saying go to Kmart and Walmart as if that's,

36:56.640 --> 36:59.680
how do they, how is that, do they have those there?

36:59.680 --> 37:03.040
I know from personal experience that Walmart does not have sock garters,

37:03.040 --> 37:05.280
so I really doubt they have man thongs.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.360
Can we call them boy skins from now on?

37:07.360 --> 37:10.320
And also can we call our podcast boy skins from now on?

37:10.320 --> 37:16.320
Hey, in the effort to actually give this person a helpful answer,

37:16.320 --> 37:19.920
I just Googled boy skins and boy do I regret it.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.720
I shouldn't have done that.

37:22.720 --> 37:28.400
And if there are any government agents now monitoring my DSL usage, I'm sorry.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.480
Very sorry, I didn't mean to do it.

37:30.480 --> 37:34.400
Is boy skins, I don't see a website called boy skins.

37:34.400 --> 37:39.520
I see a lot of usernames named boy skins and a Yahoo, a YouTube channel called boy skins.

37:39.520 --> 37:43.840
So I'm thinking that this person's trying to start some branding.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.800
Oh, all these accounts are closed.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.120
I'm trying to Nancy Drew this shit, but.

37:49.120 --> 37:54.240
Boy skins just fell off the face, well, fell off the butt of the internet, let's be honest.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.960
About, nope, fuck.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.480
Nope, you can't find boy skins anywhere.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.880
There's a, there's a blog spot called boy skin.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.800
Oh no, don't just go to boy skin at blog spot.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.320
Oh, it's dicks all over dicks for miles.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.120
How could this happen?

38:13.120 --> 38:17.280
Well, you know, in 20 years on an episode of storage wars,

38:17.840 --> 38:22.640
they'll open up a storage container and find this box after box label boy skins.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.200
And they'd be looking at going, you know, the money skins are worth,

38:25.840 --> 38:28.400
that's like a thousand dollars a box right there.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.040
I'm seeing like $6,000 in thongs.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.560
Is that a Hummel boy skin?

38:32.560 --> 38:35.040
I can tell that looks like a Hummel boy skin.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.720
I was hoping that they were going to find the boy skin website.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.520
Cause I was curious how you were going to conceptualize that for me.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.840
Do we have to domain name boy skins?

38:45.360 --> 38:50.720
Underneath, underneath this, what appears to be an elderly woman sewing table folded

38:50.720 --> 38:51.920
up in the shelves here.

38:51.920 --> 38:56.240
There seems to be a website called boy skins.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.920
It's become corporeal.

38:57.920 --> 38:58.880
It looks hungry.

39:00.160 --> 39:04.160
It seems, now this looks like a regular cupboard, but when you open it and go inside,

39:04.160 --> 39:07.520
you exit on the other side into boy skins, the website.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.680
Have a look around its directories and indexes.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.880
You're going to like what you see.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.560
You're going to be horrified at the way you look.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.280
I guarantee it.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.920
So Mr. Tumnus, you look fantastic.

39:21.120 --> 39:21.920
Very svelte.

39:21.920 --> 39:26.960
How did you get the tiny holes over your furry legs, Mr. Tumnus?

39:28.880 --> 39:32.720
That is really doing some, it is shaping you very attractively.

39:32.720 --> 39:38.560
That is the most vivid mental picture I think we've ever created on this show.

39:38.560 --> 39:41.440
Cause I can't, I can't, it's a lot of, it's like-

39:41.440 --> 39:42.320
I can't get it out.

39:42.320 --> 39:47.360
And if you could see in my head, the look Mr. Tumnus is giving me is troubling.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.640
Cause it's angry.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.000
It's not like a seductive look.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.280
He's angry that I'm there.

39:51.280 --> 39:57.200
I'm forming this sentence with my mouth and speaking it with the power from my brain,

39:57.200 --> 40:01.360
but I'm only dedicating about 1% of my brain to that task cause the other 99%

40:01.360 --> 40:04.960
is dreaming up this visage.

40:04.960 --> 40:05.600
And I can't.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.200
I've been meaning to correct you children.

40:10.080 --> 40:13.200
It's pronounced ass land.

40:15.200 --> 40:15.760
Jesus.

40:20.480 --> 40:26.160
Hey, I'm a straight red-blooded American male who in May is serving as best man at my gay

40:26.160 --> 40:27.840
best friend's wedding.

40:27.840 --> 40:31.600
Ceremony itself is very traditional, but I'm stumped when it comes to the bachelor party.

40:31.600 --> 40:36.080
The attendee mix is going to be about 50, 50 straight gay with a few lesbians thrown

40:36.080 --> 40:36.640
in for color.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.880
How do I throw my pal a rainbow colored bachelor party?

40:40.880 --> 40:45.760
Please note that my friend by his own admission is a terrible gay and he's expressed support

40:45.760 --> 40:49.920
on one occasion, a desire to have an Asian lady stripper at his party getting down in

40:49.920 --> 40:50.400
Durham.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.040
Wow.

40:51.040 --> 40:51.440
Wowzers.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.840
I feel like the bulk of it's already planned.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.160
This is a lot-

40:54.160 --> 40:55.840
Asian lady stripper.

40:55.840 --> 40:59.120
I mean, this is a- this is a real tough one.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.800
We don't get many toughies like this.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.320
Ultimately, the easy answer, which is to say the not funny answer, is you give him what

41:06.320 --> 41:09.280
he wants and I guess an Asian lady stripper.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.400
I guess that's what you do.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.320
This is my answer.

41:12.320 --> 41:12.960
The fun answer.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.280
What can't- what can't you do?

41:15.280 --> 41:16.160
God, you're right.

41:16.160 --> 41:20.480
I'm imagining like a- like a coligulin miasma of genital delights.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.840
Just a bacchanal.

41:21.840 --> 41:22.320
Just a-

41:22.320 --> 41:22.720
Yeah.

41:22.720 --> 41:26.000
What's a- what can- what do you want because it's everywhere.

41:26.640 --> 41:30.320
The fucking sky's the limit as far as fucking goes.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.360
Earthly delights.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.240
Put it anywhere.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.960
Happy bachelor party.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.560
Sorry Dave couldn't marry you.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.840
He died last night.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.640
He OD'd on hedonism.

41:42.960 --> 41:48.400
Now he's a- he's a weird sexaholic and he can only love gay dead-

41:48.400 --> 41:56.400
He was drinking wine out of a lady's hair and he was going crazy.

41:56.400 --> 41:56.880
Are we done?

41:59.600 --> 42:00.320
Maybe a cake?

42:00.960 --> 42:01.440
I don't know.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.280
Maybe a tasteful cake.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.000
Some- some balloons?

42:06.000 --> 42:07.920
Hey, welcome to Cake Boss.

42:07.920 --> 42:14.320
This week on Cake Boss, we're making a big cake shaped like a butthole for a gay guy's bachelor

42:14.320 --> 42:17.200
party with an Asian lady stripper gonna pop out of it.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.040
We're making a cake-

42:19.040 --> 42:22.320
This cake looks like a dick going into a cake shaped like a vagina going into a

42:22.320 --> 42:24.240
cake shaped like another vagina.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.040
Cake Boss.

42:25.840 --> 42:26.720
Cake Boss.

42:27.600 --> 42:31.520
Stay tuned for the littlest chocolatiers, by which I mean they're inside the cake.

42:31.520 --> 42:32.240
What the fuck?

42:34.400 --> 42:36.160
I'm making eight dicks today.

42:36.160 --> 42:36.880
Cake Boss.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.000
This isn't even for a party.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.800
This isn't even being filmed right now.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.440
This butthole cake's for Cake Boss. Cake Boss.

43:00.880 --> 43:01.600
This cake's for-

43:03.440 --> 43:05.200
Fucking Cake Boss.

43:05.200 --> 43:15.840
This cake's made of sand and also I'm a ghost.

43:25.840 --> 43:26.080
Yeah.

43:26.080 --> 43:30.000
Guys, this Yahoo answer was- should I- should we Yahoo it?

43:30.640 --> 43:33.680
Yeah, I was about to ask you for one and then you fucking incepted me.

43:34.320 --> 43:34.960
I love it.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.640
This Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

43:36.640 --> 43:37.760
Thank you, Lisa.

43:37.760 --> 43:40.880
Lisa is becoming, quickly, our top gold contributor.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.520
This question was asked by Rezxion.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.640
R-E-Z-X-I-A-N.

43:48.640 --> 43:49.520
Rezek-

43:49.520 --> 43:50.160
Rezektion.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.840
Or perhaps Rejohn.

43:54.720 --> 43:55.280
Oh no.

43:56.240 --> 43:56.640
Rejohn.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.960
Gucci Gucci Vinny Vinny Vinny Vinny Park.

44:00.720 --> 44:01.840
Kreishon asks-

44:03.280 --> 44:04.880
Gucci Gucci Vinny Vinny Vinny Park.

44:04.880 --> 44:07.120
Gucci Gucci Gucci Vinchy Vinchy Marijuana.

44:09.440 --> 44:10.880
What's up with these basic bitches?

44:14.640 --> 44:15.760
Rejohn asks-

44:15.760 --> 44:20.160
If you could assassinate any of the characters of Saved By The Bell, who would it be and how?

44:23.360 --> 44:27.360
Zack, Slater, Screech, Kelly, Lisa, Jessie or Mr. Belding?

44:27.360 --> 44:29.200
I would have to go with-

44:31.680 --> 44:33.280
Probably A.C. Slater.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.280
Oh my god.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.280
You actually answered it.

44:35.280 --> 44:42.200
Well, you know, the funny thing about this is that this is actually how Good Morning

44:42.200 --> 44:48.040
Miss Bliss ended was with the assassination of Miss Bliss, and it was the catalyst of

44:48.040 --> 44:49.040
Saved by the Bell.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.720
That's how Saved by the Bell started.

44:50.720 --> 44:51.720
As I'm going over this...

44:51.720 --> 44:53.760
Hayley Mell's character, Miss Bliss, was assassinated.

44:53.760 --> 44:59.120
As I'm going over this wiki, one of my favorite things that I've learned is that the creators

44:59.120 --> 45:04.680
and writers and the producers and everything don't give two shits about continuity in

45:04.680 --> 45:09.360
the Saved by the Bell universe, because like, so they cancelled Good Morning Miss Bliss

45:09.360 --> 45:13.680
after like 12 episodes and re-launched it to Saved by the Bell, and so then when they

45:13.680 --> 45:18.400
sold it into syndication, they just kind of wrapped the Good Morning Miss Bliss episodes

45:18.400 --> 45:21.560
into it, and they're like, fuck it, no one will notice.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.560
And nobody did.

45:22.560 --> 45:23.560
They're kids, Donald.

45:23.560 --> 45:24.560
They're kids.

45:24.560 --> 45:27.480
Kids are stupid.

45:27.480 --> 45:32.080
They just love Zack's hair, and they love romance between him and Kelly Kapowski.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.080
Did you see?

45:33.080 --> 45:35.280
He said, time out, and he had like a phone and shit.

45:35.280 --> 45:36.280
It's awesome.

45:36.280 --> 45:37.280
Back off.

45:37.280 --> 45:41.160
I would, of course, assassinate Zack, because you do that, the infrastructure crumbles,

45:41.160 --> 45:43.280
and you can slip in there, and then you're the cool guy.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.080
You can't let anyone know you did it.

45:45.080 --> 45:50.520
What you're failing to take into account, Justin, is that all of this is the dream of

45:50.520 --> 45:58.760
Zack Morris, he's staring into a snow globe while his dad and mom sit in the corner going,

45:58.760 --> 46:03.240
he just stares at it all day long.

46:03.240 --> 46:07.040
When he freezes time, he actually is talking to his therapist.

46:07.040 --> 46:12.600
Let's back up really quick, because first off, I don't think you assassinate a Saved

46:12.600 --> 46:13.600
by the Bell character.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.800
I think you can only murder them.

46:15.800 --> 46:21.160
I think if you kill Zack or A.C. Slater, it's a murder and not an assassination, right?

46:21.160 --> 46:22.160
What's the difference?

46:22.160 --> 46:27.000
I thought you were going to say that you can't murder them because they're all vampires.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.240
Well, that, but I don't know.

46:29.240 --> 46:30.640
You can only slay them.

46:30.640 --> 46:36.800
You assassinate a king or a political figure, but you murder a high school student.

46:36.800 --> 46:41.880
I would assassinate Senator Zack Morris.

46:41.880 --> 46:47.480
I mean, to be fair, Zack is basically the king of Bayside High.

46:47.480 --> 46:50.400
I think he may have even referred to himself as such.

46:50.400 --> 46:55.540
That's actually how the high school wars were started, is that Archduke Zack Morris was

46:55.540 --> 47:03.720
assassinated by one of the cast of California Dreams, actually assassinated Archduke Zack

47:03.720 --> 47:06.880
Morris, and that was the start of...

47:06.880 --> 47:12.960
The problem is is that the kids from California Dreams had a signed treaty with the cast of

47:12.960 --> 47:19.080
Hang Loose that said that in the event of war, you have to fight with us, and pretty

47:19.080 --> 47:20.080
soon it just got really hairy.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.640
The Zack Attack Proclamation.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
Mm-hmm.

47:22.640 --> 47:23.640
Right.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.680
We all recall.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.360
Let's play a game called...

47:27.360 --> 47:29.420
The shot heard around Bayside.

47:29.420 --> 47:34.600
Let's play a game called Who on Yahoo Answers Scares the Shit Out of Me the Most?

47:34.600 --> 47:40.640
Is it best answer submitter Ot Yowna who replies, AC Slater, I don't know how, but I'd make

47:40.640 --> 47:41.640
it painful.

47:41.640 --> 47:42.640
Whoa.

47:42.640 --> 47:43.640
Okay.

47:43.640 --> 47:48.920
Is it cutiepie1987 who says, Kelly, suffocation on pom-poms.

47:48.920 --> 47:49.920
Wow.

47:49.920 --> 47:55.320
Is it Chris who said, screech, I would choke him, I hate his voice.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.000
Jesus Christ.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.420
Was it James A?

47:58.420 --> 48:03.280
It was James A, who responded, I would handcuff them all together in a circle, then I would

48:03.280 --> 48:07.000
stand in the center wearing body armor and drop a live hand grenade.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.760
Whoever lived would be subsequently beheaded.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.760
Wow.

48:10.760 --> 48:11.760
Wow.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.240
I would watch that movie.

48:13.240 --> 48:15.720
Dear internet, this is Travis.

48:15.720 --> 48:18.520
We're breaking up.

48:18.520 --> 48:23.620
Brynn McDonald 2005 said, Jessie, because she was one of the ones who left for most

48:23.620 --> 48:27.960
of the show and returned only till the end for Kelly and Zack's wedding, I would have

48:27.960 --> 48:30.400
her fall out her window room.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.400
Wow.

48:31.400 --> 48:34.920
Jessie, you fair weather bitch.

48:34.920 --> 48:35.920
Wow.

48:35.920 --> 48:39.320
Yeah, she's there when it suits her.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.320
Yeah.

48:40.320 --> 48:43.560
I would kill Tori Scott because clearly she is a phantasm.

48:43.560 --> 48:45.360
Can we just kill nobody?

48:45.360 --> 48:49.160
Can we not kill anybody on this fictional kids show?

48:49.160 --> 48:54.560
You fuck.

48:54.560 --> 49:00.120
You know what's funny by definition about the phrase, I'm not a sports nut, is that

49:00.120 --> 49:05.320
if you actually use the phrase sports nut, it automatically disqualifies you from the

49:05.320 --> 49:06.320
distinction.

49:06.320 --> 49:07.880
Unless you're Bob Euker.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.480
If you're Bob Euker, he can say he's a sports nut.

49:10.480 --> 49:11.480
Yeah.

49:11.480 --> 49:15.080
Other than that, you don't like sports.

49:15.080 --> 49:18.120
You're saying something you think someone like sports says.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.680
I'm a bit of a sports nut.

49:20.680 --> 49:23.240
I think you could call me a sports nut.

49:23.240 --> 49:26.280
I spend time at the BW3s.

49:26.280 --> 49:35.400
Someone could accurately classify me as a basketball man, a soccerista, a soccerista

49:35.400 --> 49:36.400
in your country.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.760
Well, I don't know what they call soccer.

49:39.760 --> 49:40.760
Footballerino.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.640
Football, footballist, I guess.

49:43.640 --> 49:49.600
What about, no, I got nothing.

49:49.600 --> 49:50.600
I like that honesty.

49:50.600 --> 49:51.600
Polo.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.600
That's what I was going for, polo.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.600
Polo.

49:54.600 --> 49:58.000
We need more horse-based sports.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.480
We need to be more honest about the production of this show, Travis.

50:00.480 --> 50:01.480
I like that.

50:01.480 --> 50:02.480
Hit me.

50:02.480 --> 50:12.080
This one was, this one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

50:12.080 --> 50:13.080
Thank you, Lisa.

50:13.080 --> 50:17.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, the Leviathan, who asks, how do you prepare for a staring

50:17.960 --> 50:18.960
contest?

50:18.960 --> 50:23.600
I always get into a staring contest with my cousin when I see him and I want to prepare

50:23.600 --> 50:25.480
to finally beat him over the holidays.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.960
What can I do to become a champ?

50:26.960 --> 50:31.040
This is a good sport you can get into, right?

50:31.040 --> 50:33.560
Step one, training montage.

50:33.560 --> 50:38.120
Staring contest, you're going to, step one, you're going to want to moisturize.

50:38.120 --> 50:41.360
Is applying Visine during a staring contest legal?

50:41.360 --> 50:42.360
Is that allowed?

50:42.360 --> 50:43.360
As long as you don't blink.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.360
If you could do that blink-less.

50:44.360 --> 50:46.960
Then you're a fucking robot with robot eyes.

50:46.960 --> 50:47.960
Yeah.

50:47.960 --> 50:48.960
Oh, robot eyes.

50:48.960 --> 50:49.960
Steve Forbes up in this bitch.

50:49.960 --> 50:50.960
Oh, robot eyes.

50:50.960 --> 50:56.280
If you tap both your eyes out, put some glass in there, you'll never, I don't think you'll

50:56.280 --> 50:57.280
have to moisten them.

50:57.280 --> 51:01.080
Wait, do you mean just like shards of glass or like a fake eyeball?

51:01.080 --> 51:02.560
Glass eyeballs, not shards of glass.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.320
Okay, shards of glass is a very intimidating technique.

51:05.320 --> 51:06.320
Yeah.

51:06.320 --> 51:08.560
I don't see how that helps you.

51:08.560 --> 51:12.360
Did, can I get a clarification on this?

51:12.360 --> 51:16.420
I find that I travel all around this great, great blue globe and people have different

51:16.420 --> 51:18.480
definitions of staring contest.

51:18.480 --> 51:23.200
When I was growing up in my neck of the woods, it was if you blinked, you lose.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.760
If you blinked, you were out.

51:24.760 --> 51:26.040
If you blinked, you're out.

51:26.040 --> 51:30.800
But a lot of people seem to roll with if you smile or laugh, you're out.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.440
It's about keeping a straight face.

51:32.440 --> 51:33.440
No.

51:33.440 --> 51:36.040
Then that could just go on forever.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.360
See Griffin knew what I was talking about though.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.360
Griffin complete.

51:38.360 --> 51:39.360
Yeah, yeah.

51:39.360 --> 51:40.360
I've heard it.

51:40.360 --> 51:41.360
Do you know what it was?

51:41.360 --> 51:51.400
It was a lot of kids were doing it, the original full game version of staring contest and they

51:51.400 --> 51:53.800
were going blind.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.080
They were just going blind.

51:55.080 --> 52:03.080
And so the academia, the public education system of this great nation of ours sort of

52:03.080 --> 52:09.560
enforced the second rule set and taught that to my generation so that our perfect peepers

52:09.560 --> 52:11.400
would remain.

52:11.400 --> 52:14.900
And then when that started to get boring, they introduced Pogs.

52:14.900 --> 52:18.120
They actually recorded a lot of, there was a lot of public awareness.

52:18.120 --> 52:24.640
The same people who did I'm Not Gonna Play Sun City did a tribute song, If You Care Please

52:24.640 --> 52:25.640
Don't Stare.

52:25.640 --> 52:26.640
Yeah.

52:26.640 --> 52:29.400
That was kind of swept the airwaves.

52:29.400 --> 52:33.840
Lionel Richie I think co-wrote that with Andrew Dice Clay, which was kind of a weird pairing.

52:33.840 --> 52:37.880
And then there was the one Stop and Think and then Take a Blink.

52:37.880 --> 52:38.880
Right.

52:38.880 --> 52:39.880
I really liked that one.

52:39.880 --> 52:40.880
Who co-wrote that, Trav?

52:40.880 --> 52:41.880
Because I was trying to remember.

52:41.880 --> 52:46.280
I think that was Elton John and Billy Joel together.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.760
It was amazing.

52:47.760 --> 52:48.760
Okay.

52:48.760 --> 52:49.760
Yeah.

52:49.760 --> 52:58.320
There was a redo of the Donald O'Connor song, Make Them Laugh, Make Them Laugh, colon,

52:58.320 --> 53:00.360
the new rule set for staring contest.

53:00.360 --> 53:01.360
Right.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.600
For God's sakes, Make Them Laugh.

53:03.600 --> 53:04.680
Who co-wrote that?

53:04.680 --> 53:05.680
I forget.

53:05.680 --> 53:12.200
It was originally written by Donald O'Connor, but the new version was written by Rosie O'Donnell.

53:12.200 --> 53:13.200
And Donald Loege.

53:13.200 --> 53:14.200
That's weird.

53:14.200 --> 53:15.200
That's weird.

53:15.200 --> 53:28.880
And I know that there was another one, Song for About Blinking Laugh.

53:28.880 --> 53:30.720
And that one was by Tears for Fears.

53:30.720 --> 53:37.160
That one was by Tears for Fears and Infant Lady Gaga.

53:37.160 --> 53:38.560
Embryo Gaga.

53:38.560 --> 53:44.080
I basically wanted to say Infant Lady Gaga and didn't come up with the part with the

53:44.080 --> 53:45.080
song.

53:45.080 --> 53:48.480
So I kind of, I don't know if you guys could notice, but I kind of flubbed my way through

53:48.480 --> 53:49.480
that.

53:49.480 --> 53:50.480
No, no.

53:50.480 --> 53:51.480
You totally covered it.

53:51.480 --> 53:52.480
Did I nail it?

53:52.480 --> 53:53.480
Malcolm to the Mabim Bam Sausage Factory.

53:53.480 --> 53:58.480
We're taking you inside with director's commentary this week.

53:58.480 --> 54:07.480
Is it weird that when I talk about babies, I have to talk in this voice so I don't wake

54:07.480 --> 54:10.360
up the imaginary baby in my room?

54:10.360 --> 54:12.000
I don't think that's weird.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Okay.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.680
Um, I don't do it.

54:14.680 --> 54:15.680
I don't do it.

54:15.680 --> 54:16.680
I don't.

54:16.680 --> 54:17.680
It's not a conscious decision.

54:17.680 --> 54:21.440
Is there an age cutoff for imaginary baby that you talk to in your room?

54:21.440 --> 54:24.840
I just, I just want to be soft.

54:24.840 --> 54:27.000
Is imaginary baby there right now Griffin?

54:27.000 --> 54:28.880
Babies aren't tough, you know, guys.

54:28.880 --> 54:29.880
So don't get rough.

54:29.880 --> 54:30.880
Let's not get rough with these babies.

54:30.880 --> 54:35.280
Do you ever sit in a, do you have a rocker in your office in which you snuggle and rock

54:35.280 --> 54:37.160
your imaginary baby?

54:37.160 --> 54:39.920
It's not a real, it's not a real imaginary baby.

54:39.920 --> 54:43.360
I'm just saying I talk like there is one.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.120
I know, I know it's not a real imaginary baby, sweetie.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.880
If you wouldn't, if you guys wouldn't mind, just like keep it down, keep your voices down

54:48.880 --> 54:49.880
a little bit.

54:49.880 --> 54:50.880
Um, what's his name?

54:50.880 --> 54:51.880
It's adorable.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.880
His name is Dor, Dor, Dor.

54:54.880 --> 55:03.720
Wait, hold on, did you name your imaginary baby Dwarf?

55:03.720 --> 55:07.880
He sounds like the head of the House of Lannister.

55:07.880 --> 55:12.720
Oh God.

55:12.720 --> 55:20.000
I like the one where your imaginary baby taught me how to play golf.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.800
And Tim Conway has Dwarf.

55:24.800 --> 55:28.360
He's short because he's a baby.

55:28.360 --> 55:31.600
It's an imaginary baby that lives in Griffith's heart.

55:31.600 --> 55:32.600
Dwarf.

55:32.600 --> 55:42.800
You know, when I, when I go, whenever I go hiking, I always bring a big bag of Dwarf.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.480
Delicious.

55:44.480 --> 55:50.560
What about mini golf attendees?

55:50.560 --> 55:52.200
The people who have to like chase off the team.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.200
Windmill winder.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.440
And teens are like fucking on the mini golf course.

55:55.440 --> 55:58.320
Somebody has to chase him off and that's a job that we can get paid for.

55:58.320 --> 56:01.000
Get out of that clown's mouth, you fucking teens.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Yeah.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Dirty, dirty, dirty teens.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Oh shit.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Jesus, it's Dorp.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
You kids get out of here.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Get out of here.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
I'm an invisible baby.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
I'm an invisible baby from Brooklyn.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.040
Get out of that clown's mouth.

56:10.040 --> 56:17.720
I made an invisible boom boom in my typy.

56:17.720 --> 56:32.840
I'm going to call the baby police to have them come get you out.

56:32.840 --> 56:35.520
Baby fireman in the tiny ladders.

56:35.520 --> 56:42.960
And now I sound like a baby hairdresser.

56:42.960 --> 56:45.880
This is baby mini golf so you can't even see it.

56:45.880 --> 56:48.040
It's microscopic.

56:48.040 --> 56:51.080
And it's imaginary baby golf.

56:51.080 --> 56:58.280
Welcome to Dwarf's Mini Mini Imaginary Baby Golf.

56:58.280 --> 57:02.040
I owe it all to my dad, Griffin.

57:02.040 --> 57:03.040
It's so weird.

57:03.040 --> 57:06.680
Now where can I ash this cigar, universally?

57:06.680 --> 57:15.000
Where would be a funny, disrespectful place for me to ash my mini imaginary cigar, Dwarf?

57:15.000 --> 57:27.200
Next time on Invisible Baby, All in the Family.

57:27.200 --> 57:33.080
My child is Edith Bunker.

57:33.080 --> 57:34.320
Let's come back with a Yahoo answer.

57:34.320 --> 57:37.940
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield, too.

57:37.940 --> 57:38.940
Thank you so much, Lisa.

57:38.940 --> 57:39.940
Precious.

57:39.940 --> 57:40.940
Precious fan of the year.

57:40.940 --> 57:42.440
Can she just have some money?

57:42.440 --> 57:43.760
Yep.

57:43.760 --> 57:44.760
Someone give her some money.

57:44.760 --> 57:51.160
It was asked by Brian, who asks, is it illegal for me to upload a picture of me with a sword

57:51.160 --> 57:54.480
to Facebook?

57:54.480 --> 57:58.880
I want my default pic to be one of me with the sword I got in eighth grade.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.440
If I do not look threatening, is this illegal?

58:01.440 --> 58:03.520
Any ins and outs I need to be aware of?

58:03.520 --> 58:04.520
P.S.

58:04.520 --> 58:08.720
I will look civilized.

58:08.720 --> 58:09.720
Call Guinness.

58:09.720 --> 58:13.960
This is the first time David has ever looked civilized.

58:13.960 --> 58:14.960
It's me.

58:14.960 --> 58:19.040
I'm wearing a frock, and this is my gentleman's foil.

58:19.040 --> 58:20.040
How civil?

58:20.040 --> 58:25.120
I'm actually, I'm looking at the Facebook rules right now about posting pictures, and

58:25.120 --> 58:29.720
it says to do it, you have to have a really intense look on your face and be holding the

58:29.720 --> 58:31.920
sword somewhere down around your crotch.

58:31.920 --> 58:37.840
You have to have photoshopped fire, like Dragon Ball Z fire, on the sword and possibly in

58:37.840 --> 58:42.600
your eyes, and it has to say something above it, like, Destiny.

58:42.600 --> 58:47.000
And you have to make sure that you've tastefully trimmed your scraggly beard.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.400
If somebody could photoshop us, pictures of us like that, I will make it my favorite.

58:50.400 --> 58:54.080
I want nothing but Dragon Ball Z photoshops of us.

58:54.080 --> 58:55.080
Fire, swords, beards.

58:55.080 --> 58:59.160
There's fire and swords, laser beams, tails.

58:59.160 --> 59:03.720
Maybe he meant civilized, which is to look like Sybil Shepard.

59:03.720 --> 59:11.200
I like the idea of civilized better, like us in full 1930s military regalia with an

59:11.200 --> 59:14.360
epée in one hand and a tea sandwich in the other.

59:14.360 --> 59:15.360
Very fancy.

59:15.360 --> 59:19.680
I used to own swords, everybody.

59:19.680 --> 59:20.680
I still have swords.

59:20.680 --> 59:22.040
There's nothing wrong with that.

59:22.040 --> 59:24.600
I'm just not gonna like take Facebook.

59:24.600 --> 59:30.560
It's like, I mean, there's lots of, okay, I have a crockpot, but if my Facebook picture

59:30.560 --> 59:36.160
is me holding a crockpot above my head like, yes!

59:36.160 --> 59:37.160
Look at it!

59:37.160 --> 59:38.160
This is me!

59:38.160 --> 59:42.720
This is me in 2012 with a crockpot, small about it.

59:42.720 --> 59:47.360
Like it doesn't matter, like putting it in your Facebook picture is, it defines you.

59:47.360 --> 59:53.160
I mean, it is your, that is your, your outside message to the world, right?

59:53.160 --> 59:58.200
Well, I think if you're the kind of person that owns swords, then you're the kind of

59:58.200 --> 01:00:02.000
person that owns swords and there's no getting around that.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.240
You know, I have, I have a sword and you guys want to know a secret?

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240
Not.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:12.040
I mean, this is really dicey, but I'm going to, I'm going to go with yes.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.560
I would never own a gun.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.880
But I see nothing wrong with keeping a sword by the bed for protection.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.240
Is this about to get, are we about to have an argument about the lethality of swords?

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.480
No, no, no.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.800
I'm just saying like, I, I see no, I would like to envision a circumstance in which a

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.800
criminal breaks into my house and has a gun and I draw a sword.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.120
You're telling me you could more easily stab a stranger with a giant sword than you could

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120
shoot a stranger.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120
Like, you sever their-

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120
No, I'm hoping that they're shocked.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.840
You stab them in the guts and then you see it.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.080
You see everything.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.280
You watch their intestines spill out across your Davenport.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.520
I can do a pretty deep lunge and I feel like it'll be really intimidating.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.840
That's, Travis, that's the most fucked up thing you've ever said out loud.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840
I don't think that's true.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:04.280
Why don't you just keep a heavy rock next to the bed, fucking you Lord of the Fly psychopath?

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.920
I keep that under the couch.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.980
I just want to, I would just like to, I don't want my kids getting hurt, but I would like

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:15.200
the feeling of crushing a man's skull with my bare hands.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.360
So I'll just keep a big rock next to my bed.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.560
Now the floor does open up into a sort of boo boo box scorpion trap.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.700
But it's that, I mean, guns, yuck.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.700
Not for me.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.200
Travis, you do have to do me a favor, though.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.400
If you ever get into this imaginary situation, you gotta tube it for me.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.600
I gotta see what happens.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:45.280
Seriously, I will make a whole Bravo series about that night you did that dumb thing.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.280
That's fair.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.280
Yeah.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:54.200
I, I, do you, okay, if you have the sword and they are like, they see you, okay?

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.200
What?

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.480
Describe that very next.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.360
This is how I picture it going.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:05.440
It's a very slow burn down to their gun and then they slow burn down to my sword and then

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.680
they drop the gun and just start backing away.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.680
Okay.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680
That's how I hope it pans out.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.680
You have, why?

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.680
Why would that happen?

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.680
Because otherwise they shoot me in the face.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680
Yeah.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:19.720
I mean, no, definitely I'm pretty well versed in the actual thing that will definitely really

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.720
happen.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.720
I'm kind of curious.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.360
Why do you think they're going to take me sort of inside and why you think they're going

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360
to see this?

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:31.360
Well, I also have the true faith that like in an emergency situation, I would just immediately

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:35.640
be able to have like the, the Dragon Ball Z fucking superpowers.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.640
Yeah.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.640
I just feel like it.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.480
Ninja would just come upon me and I would just move like a fucking bullets would come

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480
up on you.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480
You would be dead.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:53.040
Oh man, got to tube that for me.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.460

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920
song.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.880
It's a departure off of the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.120
It's an incredible album.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.640
I listen to it all the time.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640
You should too.
