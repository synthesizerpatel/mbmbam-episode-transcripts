WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:27.440
Hey, you've already been out here, you've already experienced this crowd.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.560
I'm very comfortable with the energy of this room.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.360
That's why I switched into my Tybee Island shirt.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.640
It's island time.

00:34.640 --> 00:35.140
Yeah.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.720
So that's that's code for I can say fuck now.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.760
I feel like this is the this is not only the nicest building we've ever performed in.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.640
This is the nicest building I've ever been in.

00:48.640 --> 00:53.760
And I'm I'm like 80% sure that's the first time anybody's ever said a curse word in this building.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.520
Yeah, not the last.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.840
No, most certainly not the last.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.280
Uh, this is my brother.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.280
My brother and me in an advice show for the modern era.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.320
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.400
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:18.400 --> 01:24.480
Yeah, just once.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.400
I want that to be met with silence.

01:26.400 --> 01:26.640
Yeah.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.040
Can we get ask you a favor?

01:29.040 --> 01:30.080
Yeah, sure.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.120
Can you just scoot?

01:31.120 --> 01:33.280
Yeah, can we get more monitor?

01:33.280 --> 01:34.880
We're literally so far away from each other.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.480
This gigantic, beautiful stage.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.400
I'll save you.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.520
I know this looks weird.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.560
Like, why are those three guys in the picture you took?

01:42.560 --> 01:44.400
Why are they so close to each other?

01:44.400 --> 01:50.000
They have the whole stage to their auras have to blend doesn't do that fleet with Mac.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.640
Can we can we start the podcast off by just detailing just how many times we've just completely

01:58.640 --> 02:05.200
fucked up being in Canada, just like from literally the word like I made you guys promise

02:05.200 --> 02:10.800
this wouldn't turn into like the can you believe it's different like the Canada, the Canada

02:10.800 --> 02:17.840
the Canada chapter of the big john's bathroom reader but like holy shit we have screwed

02:17.840 --> 02:22.320
up literally everything can see the best example I can give is when we crossed the border and

02:22.320 --> 02:28.480
everyone in the car was amazed that suddenly things were different right it was like holy

02:28.480 --> 02:38.720
shit I can go 100 miles an hour yes Canada rules that we saw a gas station and Travis

02:38.720 --> 02:44.800
was like it's 119 that's crazy and Justin was like no that's not even the good part

02:44.800 --> 02:52.000
Justin said well yeah they would have no reason to use gallons it's pints what and everyone

02:52.000 --> 02:58.080
in the car was like oh yeah yeah it sounds about right yeah in my defense the guy at

02:58.080 --> 03:05.360
Hertz told me that got you we had uh we have a theme on our program sort of a recurring

03:05.360 --> 03:13.520
gag that uh we don't know how to find marijuana anymore and we made it something of a tactical

03:13.520 --> 03:21.040
error in performing shows in places where it is cool as a cucumber and as easy to get

03:21.040 --> 03:28.800
as cucumbers are yeah to just buy it so uh we we met some folks last night and one of

03:28.800 --> 03:38.560
the gifts that we received a couple of times was jazz cigarettes yes yes was weed now this

03:38.560 --> 03:44.960
is very exciting to us hooray because we're not cool very cool it was very cool the only

03:44.960 --> 03:52.560
thing was we realized we're crossing the Canadian border that is not cool and pre pre-tension

03:52.560 --> 03:57.440
set in like this is the idea of like tomorrow this will be a problem yeah so we needed to

03:57.440 --> 04:10.320
smoke all of this tonight we didn't we didn't we got we tried we got close got sleepy but

04:10.320 --> 04:16.960
here's the thing right we were so like i wanted you don't say we it was you you were no leading

04:16.960 --> 04:21.760
up to the event we were all very worried about border crossing like they would peel back

04:21.760 --> 04:26.720
one of like the floor mats and just find a weed yeah that we had forgotten about and

04:26.720 --> 04:31.360
then we would go to like guantanamo bay this paranoia didn't just extend to marijuana and

04:31.360 --> 04:38.320
marijuana-based products uh i didn't we have little meat sticks for our baby that i threw

04:38.320 --> 04:42.880
away because i know you couldn't bring meat that's the level of like by the way you guys

04:42.880 --> 04:47.200
are missing out on so america is we had to get out of there because it was getting pretty

04:47.200 --> 04:53.600
real uh but we do meet pretty good and i can't believe y'all don't get to to sample that but

04:53.600 --> 04:58.800
i was so worried about like i had all my paperwork when we get to this border and i

04:59.600 --> 05:06.880
i am now using that term loosely dude at the border travis gets out it says there's seven

05:06.880 --> 05:12.000
of us and he hands them the three passports that he had and he said uh only got three here

05:12.640 --> 05:17.920
and travis reaches back and hands him the rest of our passports and then he looks at our passports

05:17.920 --> 05:26.240
and then we drive through so he did not corroborate the alcohol in there and i was like i don't think

05:26.240 --> 05:34.800
so no no no it went like this do you have any tobacco or alcohol um no

05:38.000 --> 05:44.480
that did not warrant a check the fact that one of my passports is for a baby the dude did not

05:44.480 --> 05:48.880
even look in like is that a baby so when he was like turn off the engine and step out of the car

05:48.880 --> 05:54.800
we just like jessica everybody out which which which do you want us to go to american jail or

05:54.800 --> 06:00.000
canadian jail please god put me in the direction of the nearest jail could not have been less

06:00.000 --> 06:08.240
interested did not like we couldn't like i i imagine travis like leaning back the man needs

06:08.240 --> 06:14.720
four more passports dig dig out four more from our box give me american passports give me four

06:14.720 --> 06:21.920
four more a little bit of accent work from our box of passports uh also we were streaming carly

07:42.960 --> 07:50.560

07:50.560 --> 07:58.160
middle are cool too my boyfriend and i are moving in together today and i have serious concerns

07:58.160 --> 08:04.400
about our breakfast out situation in the future his usual mo is to order the biggest most average

08:04.400 --> 08:10.320
breakfast they have on the menu that is the travis mcgroy special and not like a huge burrito

08:10.320 --> 08:15.600
or omelet or whatever but just the item that boasts the largest amount of eggs bacon hash browns

08:15.600 --> 08:20.800
and toasts how do i explain to my boyfriend now that we've moved to the big city he should branch

08:20.800 --> 08:28.960
out into other delicious breakfast options that's from very excited in vancouver very excited are

08:28.960 --> 08:41.120
you here you're here oh that was the saddest uh egg man are you here no he is here can you just

08:41.120 --> 08:47.040
raise your hand it's kind of a you don't want to put your egg your egg boyfriend okay egg man can

08:47.040 --> 08:57.840
i tell you you're right and she's wrong oh there you know what's really hard to fuck up eggs bacon

08:57.840 --> 09:03.200
and toast yeah really hard to mess that up you know it's really easy to mess up great burrito

09:03.200 --> 09:14.800
yeah eggs bacon and toast yeah listen but crepes are great listen that's true but like breakfast

09:14.800 --> 09:20.880
is like one of the most utilitarian meals of the day right it exists i mean don't get me wrong it

09:20.880 --> 09:26.640
can be delicious i've had great ones miss ower over here somewhere i know breakfast can't be

09:26.640 --> 09:32.800
awesome but mostly it exists so that you're not cranky by 11 a.m yeah right you could say that

09:32.800 --> 09:44.880
about all meals though if you think about it that's true griffin my the reason i celebrate

09:44.880 --> 09:51.360
eggs bacon and toast is that is as a tactical choice if you don't necessarily know what the

09:51.360 --> 09:56.400
day shall hold it is the best tactical breakfast option you can make there are many times you will

09:56.400 --> 10:02.320
look who in this room and i do want to see a show of hands on this one who in this room has looked

10:02.320 --> 10:07.600
at a breakfast or brunch menu and seen the french toast and thought fuck i'd like to eat some french

10:07.600 --> 10:13.680
toast but then realized that the rest of your day is about that fucking french toast as soon as you

10:13.680 --> 10:22.400
consume it's like well catch you guys at three and have you ever seen someone finish a breakfast

10:22.400 --> 10:29.520
burrito like finish it not like they the kitchen slices it in half to say and this is the garbage

10:29.520 --> 10:35.120
job they everybody at the table gets excited when somebody else gets the french toast because

10:35.120 --> 10:40.720
there's like i know they're gonna have some bites left at the end it's gonna get into breakfast is

10:40.720 --> 10:53.040
crazy i mean if it makes you happy then i think go for it i think this is this reminds me of the

10:53.040 --> 10:57.200
question we got out of the guy that only ordered chicken nuggets at restaurants and it's like

10:57.200 --> 11:02.800
fucking stand in your truth and chase your bliss that that is true there's not like a forum where

11:02.800 --> 11:07.760
he orders eggs bacon and toast and the other restaurants were like steven again again like

11:07.760 --> 11:12.800
they don't know the waiter doesn't know so oh this is it tell him to do it like this every time go

11:12.800 --> 11:22.320

yahoo uh yeah uh about 14 people sent this question and i don't know if they were good

11:43.440 --> 11:53.360

12:42.160 --> 12:55.040
wahoo okay hold on i misunderstood you are talking about the grinch not like is this

12:55.040 --> 13:00.480
grinch post transformation or pre-transformation not was this question submitted before the grinch

13:00.480 --> 13:09.920
was released because yahoo answers was just a twinkle in mr jefferson yahoo's eye back in 19

13:09.920 --> 13:15.120
whatever whatever no i mean are you talking about like i really like the bad boy i can change him

13:15.120 --> 13:22.880

i just carved the roast beast and all i get is a handshake

13:41.120 --> 13:47.040
oh i cannot believe she's had this much of a problem with this question being deleted yeah

13:48.160 --> 13:53.840
so i look at the related questions and the top three nope scratch at five are what would happen

13:53.840 --> 14:00.480
if i hugged and kissed the grinch so this person has been on uh the warpath and some yahoo moderators

14:00.480 --> 14:07.680
like not again no how many times no i think we've just discovered is that mrs grinch is a yahoo

14:07.680 --> 14:16.000
moderator there there is a mrs grinch and she is very active on yahoo not my husband no way kiss

14:16.000 --> 14:24.800
kiss of my man how dare you he's my husband i love him his heart's too big there's only room for one

14:24.800 --> 14:31.760
in here i'm a big lady well there could be room for three if there was room for one before no

14:31.760 --> 14:37.440
well griffin uh sorry but that would argue that there was room for one in his heart before it grew

14:37.440 --> 14:41.840
three sizes and i think we all know that there was not before he did not feel love in the way

14:41.840 --> 14:49.040
that we do i'll be back with you guys in a second because he had max who loved him sure and he did

14:49.040 --> 14:54.160
not care for max he was very no debate there but then his heart grew for sure and he gave some

14:54.160 --> 15:03.040
roses to him so now his heart is barely big enough for a small definitely definitely i have more in

15:03.040 --> 15:10.240
my published work backstage my roommate carelessly ate my last can of soup when i texted him about

15:10.240 --> 15:14.480
it he replied with an honest apology and explained that he buys the same kind of soup

15:15.040 --> 15:21.200
you may thought it was his fair enough i typed the following message in my phone no worries

15:21.760 --> 15:28.800
however as i hit send he sent a second message saying that he would replace my soup for me

15:29.760 --> 15:36.480
my no worries ended up being sent before i received his second message but it showed up

15:36.480 --> 15:43.440
in our conversation is happening after so it looks like i said no worries to the idea of him replacing

15:43.440 --> 15:55.280
my soup oh man it's the third time i've read this fucking question okay is there any way i

15:55.280 --> 16:02.160
can express them that i still desperately want that can of soup without it sounding like i'm

16:02.160 --> 16:10.640
reneging or is the order of operations etched in stone that's from souples in canada's seattle

16:10.640 --> 16:18.080

21:54.480 --> 22:00.480
here's a yahoo here's the yahoo cinema jacob locker thank you jacob coming out of retirement

22:00.480 --> 22:07.440
jacob locker it's by yahoo answers user tim who asks how to kill time in a cheap and sleazy motel

22:09.920 --> 22:13.600
i'll be stuck in a sleazy motel for about 30 to 45 days

22:13.600 --> 22:21.280
it sucks yeah you know what now that i think about that's a long stay yeah it's a long

22:21.280 --> 22:29.440
and also a very vague time for 30 to 45 days yeah that could be 50 percent longer

22:29.440 --> 22:32.800
you never know how long it's gonna take for the police to stop looking for you

22:32.800 --> 22:44.400
you they're an unpredictable bunch cops it sucks it's noisy almost all the time and the

22:44.400 --> 22:50.320
guests are creepy and grim looking no en suite bathroom bed bugs yes

22:50.320 --> 23:03.600
yes bed bugs almost certainly yeah uh i can't afford other options right now suggestions

23:03.600 --> 23:08.960
30 to 45 days gotta kill time the first time griffin read this question i thought he was

23:08.960 --> 23:19.120
saying like on the matter of a suite bathroom the answer is no on bedrooms no no bed bugs wait so

23:19.120 --> 23:25.840
bed bugs yeah yes we can he shares a bathroom yeah yep he's got his own bed bugs yes

23:27.920 --> 23:33.600
the other guests i don't know why he puts that in close are grim looking ghosts

23:36.320 --> 23:43.360
he might be in purgatory yeah sure yeah everything about this question leads to but you've always

23:43.360 --> 23:52.000
been here right or he's in the movie identity uh can you spend the 30 to 45 days digging a tunnel

23:52.000 --> 23:56.720
into the bathroom because that fucking sucks that it's not connected to the place where you sleep

23:57.440 --> 24:04.320
or maybe just reno the place flip that hotel yeah yeah 30 to 45 days you could get a lot

24:04.320 --> 24:09.680
done a lot out of that oh you're coming to stay at our hotel you're gonna want to be in 10

24:09.680 --> 24:17.600
yeah trust me there's a zen garden in there yeah they have a koi pond uh marble cabinets

24:17.600 --> 24:22.960
some built-in bookshelves it's real marble countertops let's turn this into our cabinets

24:22.960 --> 24:28.880
are not a thing my little cabinets is the height of a luxury i'm very disappointed the two of you

24:28.880 --> 24:36.960
that i have to call myself on marble cabinets that's in a morgue but not anywhere else you know

24:36.960 --> 24:42.160
what you can start a morgue business you start a more big here's another thing you got 30 to 45

24:42.160 --> 24:49.040
days time to bring back the concept of a hotel detective we got a lot of young people here

24:50.640 --> 24:58.640
happened at the motel six but this guy in room four is coming for the crime and he's

24:58.640 --> 25:06.960
monk from that show monk he's in the new show tony shalhoub has seen better days tony shalhoub and

25:06.960 --> 25:13.440
monk too the sequel to monk he's in a hotel room there used to be a literal job that existed as a

25:13.440 --> 25:20.320
hotel detective where you just were on call if people lost their keys yeah or like needed to

25:20.320 --> 25:25.840
follow somebody i guess there also used to be a show called monk and a show called rescue rangers

25:25.840 --> 25:30.880
and both of those are pertinent suggestions you must understand all these things or nothing else

25:30.880 --> 25:38.240
will make sense all the best jokes require 30 to 45 seconds of backstory just a footnote at the

25:38.240 --> 25:46.160
bottom hey true believers this is the reference read another question just i'm feeling like this

25:46.160 --> 25:52.000
is going to be a real club banger my husband steve and i got married at the end of july and

25:52.000 --> 25:59.840
of the wedding day i posted one picture on instagram i don't have facebook i get it okay

26:00.640 --> 26:08.400
and i do and i'm the bad guy i get it anyway i know how i know and i don't have tv i know i get

26:08.400 --> 26:14.160
it no it's fine i don't blame you i know how annoyed some people get about having too many

26:14.160 --> 26:20.080
pictures of the same thing on instagram so i didn't want to post more than that of your wedding

26:20.080 --> 26:24.800
now that we're about to get our professional pictures back for the photographer would it

26:24.800 --> 26:30.880
be okay if i posted one or two more selected photos that's from jacklyn fearful of flooding

26:30.880 --> 26:38.000
the feed in the frozen north jacklyn jacklyn you hear jacklyn jacklyn i heard two different

26:38.000 --> 26:43.840
ones come from different points of the audience can i you're the nicest person on the internet

26:43.840 --> 26:50.640
uh in fact that you're you're bad news actually it's not flattering uh you're too nice for the

26:50.640 --> 26:57.440
internet i'm gonna need to revoke your internet card for your own good jacklyn get off the

26:57.440 --> 27:04.160
internet you're soft do you know i can't handle it out here there's a lot of i'm sorry if you've

27:04.160 --> 27:11.600
never heard this word shit on the internet and it can get really bad it's rough out there i'm

27:11.600 --> 27:17.120
gonna need you to stop internet you just can't internet anymore because that's a sad that's

27:17.120 --> 27:23.360
a sad truth is yes there are indeed people out there who'll be like pictures of your own wedding

27:23.360 --> 27:34.560
again that's the third one i've seen in 10 minutes fuck your wedding can you okay wait i i have a

27:34.560 --> 27:42.080
i have an idea can you photoshop your wedding photos to make them possibly about something else

27:42.640 --> 27:49.520
maybe you have like chili dog tuesdays and it's like but you're it's also a wedding photo but

27:49.520 --> 27:56.080
like just secretly about your wedding but mainly about uh making a throwback thursday i hear those

27:56.080 --> 28:00.000
are popular did you serve hold on this is important did you serve chili dogs at your

28:00.000 --> 28:07.520
wedding what are you talking about it could be the equivalent of chili dogs could be regular dogs

28:07.520 --> 28:15.200
that's okay uh you serve poutine don't buy into the stereotype jacqueline yeah

28:16.560 --> 28:21.520
i wanted i side note i'm very excited to try poutine why i am here yeah i'm so sad i gotta

front of you i want to clear okay so what i've got is a bag of ruffles they have ridges put an

29:11.840 --> 29:19.280
asterisk next to the episode title the happiest griffin's ever been followed by the most they are

29:19.280 --> 29:27.760
a poutine flavored ruffles my favorite thing about this bag is down here in the bottom corner where

29:27.760 --> 29:37.200
it says simulated flavor we want to be straight with y'all this ain't real poutine we had a great

29:37.200 --> 29:44.080
gift it's a great gift this is oh good it's our snack demo segment that we do on every episode

29:44.880 --> 29:51.040
the reason i got so excited is the thought of somebody having just loose gravy on them at a

29:51.040 --> 29:59.120
comedy show you want me to good delicious i'm not gonna those two will bullshit you i won't

29:59.120 --> 30:10.160

30:10.160 --> 30:16.080
like it i really do it i weigh into it you just don't have a refined palette like me and scraps

30:17.120 --> 30:21.360
i do you have another yahoo uh yeah we got it you tasteless bastard

30:21.360 --> 30:30.880

30:30.880 --> 30:35.680
crunchy installment of the yahoo segment was sent in by jacob locker again thank you jacob

30:35.680 --> 30:42.560
it's by whoo it's by an anonymous yahoo are you guys dialed in or what oh yeah for sure for sure

30:42.560 --> 30:54.240
for sure for sure it's by an anonymous user no name will calm evan asks you did evan asks

30:55.040 --> 30:57.600
how come some ghosts are cool and some are jerks

31:00.400 --> 31:04.240
i've been in a number of places where the vibe was weird and people always got negative from

31:04.240 --> 31:09.280
being around it then sometimes i'm in places and it's really positive and again it feels

31:09.280 --> 31:17.600
weird but it's supportive while in the negative experience you hear and see weird stuff you get

31:17.600 --> 31:23.680
to sleep faster in positive ones but how come some buildings presence can be negative while

31:23.680 --> 31:30.880
others positive so they walk through the positive one and they're like whoa whoa something i should

31:30.880 --> 31:37.280
take up stand-up comedy yeah that's probably why most people take up like stand-up comedy

31:37.280 --> 31:44.480
go go i felt a cold spot and also i love you too yeah why okay it is hugely upsetting to

31:44.480 --> 31:48.320
me the idea that i don't care if the ghost is positive or negative they said you get to sleep

31:48.320 --> 31:58.720
faster yeah i do not need to go to sleep with the idea of a ghost like i'll be here all night

31:58.720 --> 32:08.240
and forever find my bones and the best one but listen only when you get around to it no rush

32:08.240 --> 32:15.040
no rush dude i know you're busy chill out dude i'm a new ghost i've been only on the game for

32:15.040 --> 32:22.320
like 20 years i know you're trying to hit 30 in destiny just finishing up my dude i'll take over

32:22.320 --> 32:32.240
you go to bed i'll grind for you get you some gold bro your kd spread is a joke let me patch this up

32:32.240 --> 32:37.680
for you why is this person yelling at me on the headset does that happen in video games yeah

32:37.680 --> 32:45.040
definitely listen i'm confused by the question in so many ways but they say a number of places

32:45.040 --> 32:51.440
the vibe was weird this makes me think like the literal building is a ghost like the building was

32:51.440 --> 32:57.200
murdered in a high passion and has unfinished when you tear down a building and it still had

32:57.200 --> 33:04.560
stuff to do like i still had hats to sell i was gonna be an orphanage just give me time

33:08.560 --> 33:11.760
you know you put one orphan in a building you're a weirdo

33:11.760 --> 33:14.960
you put a hundred in a building it's an orphanage i don't get it

33:14.960 --> 33:23.520
i guess some people are cool and some are jerks right and then they die and become ghosts that's

33:23.520 --> 33:28.240
usually how it works that's the thing i'm actually more worried about why there would be ghosts who

33:28.240 --> 33:35.840
are cool yeah where those who are jerks yeah that makes sense to me i'm angry i'm dead i can't do

33:35.840 --> 33:43.120
shit i'm but a ghost who's just like hey man you know what are you gonna do jkl or jkd jkd just

33:43.120 --> 33:49.360
keep dying just keep dying like a ghost is like you know what i've made peace with my situation

33:49.360 --> 33:55.440
this is me i'm a hollow bastard that's the problem though you can get too complacent yeah that's why

33:55.440 --> 34:00.960
they're stuck they're too nice you gotta be hungry to get off this coil you gotta you gotta work put

34:00.960 --> 34:08.720
the work in it's getting fucking dark no i mean i'm just saying it's another you want to do like

34:08.720 --> 34:15.440
ghost crossfit pain is weakness leaving the body that you left when you died how is there not

34:15.440 --> 34:21.280

34:21.280 --> 34:27.680

34:27.680 --> 34:43.520

44:50.240 --> 44:55.520
crossed crossed the border to do the hat trick was it what can i ask what can i ask question

44:55.520 --> 45:00.960
was it worth it what is what we're right the doing all of the travel yeah

45:00.960 --> 45:11.440
yeah where's the conviction okay what's your question rachel okay uh i work at a popular

45:11.440 --> 45:16.800
grocery store in a not very large town you're telling me you don't look up yahoo answers for

45:16.800 --> 45:24.480
a living you just made our advice you're right it looks stupid so when i'm out and about in town on

45:24.480 --> 45:30.960
my own time and i run into regular customers that i'm friendly with uh-huh how can i politely

45:30.960 --> 45:36.080
extricate myself from the conversation because i'm not being paid to be nice to them right

45:36.080 --> 45:45.280
then how do you have how do you have can i tell you the thing this is this is literally a thing

45:45.280 --> 45:50.080
like i have heard from so many bartenders where like they'll just be like in the neighborhood

45:50.080 --> 45:54.800
where their bar is and meet the person that they want tips from so they're very nice to them and

45:54.800 --> 46:00.080
it's like hey how's it going while they're like walking a dog and it's tough because you'll see

46:00.080 --> 46:04.240
them again how do you when they come into the store how do you know the people that come through

46:04.240 --> 46:09.200
like i've been working there for a long time and it's like a neighborhood store and you speak to

46:09.200 --> 46:15.520
them and i speak to them it's like oh it's celery steve conversations yeah yeah well that's what

46:15.520 --> 46:22.320
you can i hey how's the gluten intolerance going that's right that's that's that is less superficial

46:22.320 --> 46:29.360
than 90 percent of the conversations i have oh shit this is what you do you use the knowledge

46:29.360 --> 46:34.800
you have of their purchases against them until they get uncomfortable and stop talking to you

46:34.800 --> 46:43.360
in public how's the infection clearing up hemorrhoids still a thing huh but a lot of

46:43.360 --> 46:48.160
laxative last time is that taking care of itself where are you going see you at the store

46:50.960 --> 46:55.760
but then won't that just be equally awkward next time i see them at the store no because you have

46:55.760 --> 47:01.120
to do it like not pointedly you have to do it so like if you do it if you do it enough times no

47:01.120 --> 47:07.680
one will come to your lane and you'll just have like the most chill shifts ever pop open a can of

47:07.680 --> 47:16.160
bud light lime marita and just chill no i'm sorry if i'm sorry no if i was at a store and i saw one

47:16.160 --> 47:21.120

48:17.040 --> 48:22.400
still i'm trying to lock down that permanent and i want to know what do i need to do when

48:22.400 --> 48:28.400
i go into these schools to get the attention of my bosses without wearing like miss frizzle sweat

48:28.400 --> 48:35.520
shirts like with why is that not an option that's me like number one like thing one yeah

48:36.480 --> 48:40.320
i'm gonna turn it oh shit is there anyone in here who's the principal

48:40.320 --> 48:49.360
um shit yes shit that's a tricky needle to thread trav also i live two provinces away

48:49.360 --> 48:52.880
oh and what is that i don't know what that is yes that like

48:54.560 --> 48:58.240
from what i understand you guys have just like six big fat states

49:00.080 --> 49:07.840
no like hold on let's let brady teach us now yes substitute for the complete lack of education

49:07.840 --> 49:14.000
about oh the metric system uh traffic lights just the whole kit and caboodle

49:15.520 --> 49:22.480
okay so there's 10 provinces what did i say six yeah yeah but there's probably four they're like

49:24.240 --> 49:28.720
i live in one of them according to probably most of the people in this room

49:28.720 --> 49:37.840
sis whoa brady don't act like that in the teacher's lounge it's just it's saskatchewan that's where i live okay i like that one

49:37.840 --> 49:42.720
that's good because i was just about to say what a great province that probably it sounds a lot

49:42.720 --> 49:48.080
like sasquatch yep i like it cool i like it too you know what you could do brady you could uh

49:49.280 --> 49:54.720
pull a stand by me i think his name on that movie lean on me it's lean on me uh lock

49:54.720 --> 50:01.440
what lock the doors from the inside to keep drug dealers out and then you tell the principal like

50:01.440 --> 50:07.600
did you see i shut off the fire did you see what i did i shut off the fire escapes i locked on the

50:07.600 --> 50:14.480
doors so the drug dealers can't get in it wasn't a licensed activity but i'm trying to show initiative

50:14.480 --> 50:21.680
i saw a buzzfeed listicle the other day oh you just know this is gonna be a good story

50:21.680 --> 50:28.480
sorry i saw a buzzfeed listicle the other day and it was like these 23 sexy substitute teachers make

50:28.480 --> 50:33.120
us wish they were permanent teeth this is not a fucking goof by the way this is a realistical

50:33.840 --> 50:39.520
which i thought was fucked up these guys are just trying to do their job can we not says

50:39.520 --> 50:45.040
the guy who just objectified in substitute teacher's hands for three minutes he spray

50:45.040 --> 50:53.120
keeps gesticulating though here's here's what you could do brady uh the next time your class is in

50:53.120 --> 50:58.400
session get all the kids to stay on the desk and be like my couch my captain but you know

50:58.400 --> 51:05.200
but wait to do it until the principal comes by so just like just stay put wait i'm willing here he

51:05.200 --> 51:09.520
comes here it comes i bet that those movies and tv shows are misleading and when a principal sees

51:09.520 --> 51:14.800
a substitute teacher working real hard they're like no that's exhausting yeah i want to teach

51:14.800 --> 51:22.240
your cousin does the shit and then drinks during lunch so you can maybe try that yeah maybe give

51:22.240 --> 51:29.280
less shits yeah okay if the teaching thing doesn't work out you got all the money you

51:29.280 --> 51:33.040
need right there on the end of your wrist my ladies and gentlemen brady brady thank you so much

51:33.040 --> 51:42.400
uh wait i got it you ready yes yes yes come on down

51:48.480 --> 51:51.520
a lot of licensed music not fair use

51:52.560 --> 52:01.840
hello hi hello hi i'm fancy sorry fancy that's great and a great introduction to yourself i'm

52:01.840 --> 52:09.760
fancy now what's your and what's your name fancy oh okay got it from episode 196 oh sweet okay

52:09.760 --> 52:17.760
what's up well unfortunately exquisite fancy delight never took off i'm sorry but anyways

52:17.760 --> 52:24.960
my question and i did send it to you but just in case oops um it got lost in the mail that's okay

52:24.960 --> 52:33.360
okay a couple months ago friends and i were out for dinner and an enormous argument erupted over

52:35.440 --> 52:42.720
the habits of men who go to the bathroom were the worst by the way yes especially

52:42.720 --> 52:47.600
in a lot of ways were the worst especially in that specific way well that that was the

52:47.600 --> 52:52.960
female's opinion but among the males there was a huge argument about whether you unbuckle and

52:52.960 --> 52:59.680
undo or whether you just undo and whip out at you mean at the urinal yes not like the sink yeah

53:01.200 --> 53:08.000
yeah because that's more clear cut yeah but anyways now this argument has spread among our

53:08.000 --> 53:12.720
friends and every party we would go to there are raging fights and it started to spill over

53:12.720 --> 53:18.000
into the girls because there was a listicle on buzzfeed what the fuck see it's ruining everything

53:18.000 --> 53:24.400
yeah this one was about where you put how you put your bra on the 27 hottest substitute dogs

53:26.000 --> 53:30.800
do most of them put the bra on by like stringing it between two surfaces and diving just running

53:30.800 --> 53:37.840
through well naturally awesome i assume everybody's doing it awesome my question is

53:38.800 --> 53:43.840
what can i do to distract people when these arguments start it's thank god thank god that

53:43.840 --> 53:48.720
that was the question and not so what is it you whip it out you unbucked because we're in like

53:52.480 --> 53:56.560
i would not have answered the question otherwise because this is like a classic opera house

53:56.560 --> 54:02.320
basically and i cannot talk about my bathroom stuff you don't want to bum them out that would

54:02.320 --> 54:06.480
be too easy if you're just like how about all this stuff going on in the middle isis am i right like

54:06.480 --> 54:16.240
you can't do that i think they know what isis is in canada sure sure but you i'm saying don't do

54:16.240 --> 54:26.080
that well you did you did you did do just that um you could get something better going like cake or

54:26.080 --> 54:36.960
pie that's more divisive okay raise your hand who's cake who's pie it's not even a thing you

54:36.960 --> 54:44.400
guys not have cake in canada yes they too but we have completely run face first into the big john's

54:44.400 --> 54:56.880
element um why is this cultural imperialism by the way what we're doing up here yeah okay i just

54:56.880 --> 55:05.200
call it manifest destiny different thing my dude i don't think so um the reason we're not doing a

55:05.200 --> 55:10.560
good job at answering this is that i didn't know that there was a debate about the other thing

55:10.560 --> 55:15.520
and but talking about that would be counterproductive wouldn't it that would

55:15.520 --> 55:20.400
kind of be like your worst nightmare so we'd be adding to the problem oh no this is great

55:20.400 --> 55:26.160
you force the two sides to cross are you so it's like you make the women discuss whether you should

55:26.160 --> 55:32.400
unbuckle and undo you make the dudes discuss how you put on a bra and then you just watch the chaos

55:32.400 --> 55:41.520
yeah some fancies just want to watch the world burn that's what i've always said fancy ladies

55:41.520 --> 55:46.080
justin i just justin i want to congratulate you on not doing your michael kane impression i know

55:46.080 --> 55:50.960
it's like your favorite thing in the world no no problem i'm glad i could help by not doing it

55:50.960 --> 55:55.840
we get another i saw that hand in the middle go up first yes you pointing to yours yes yes yes you've

55:55.840 --> 56:04.480

together or leaving events together they assume that we're dating uh oh shit that sucks oh no

56:59.680 --> 57:06.880

57:31.200 --> 57:41.120
shit you would never date somebody with such bad taste in podcasts is this worse than if no it's

57:41.120 --> 57:47.600
worse than anything dean i thought about it super quick could you do staggered entrances

57:48.560 --> 57:52.720
staggered entrances but don't talk to each other at all during the event that's important what's

57:52.720 --> 58:05.280

58:24.640 --> 58:29.600
some level of commiserate like that's we don't usually do usually we like try to help out a

58:29.600 --> 58:35.440
little bit or at least say something funny but that's just bad you do get a power move if they're

59:14.400 --> 59:21.440
to do with my question actually okay good thank you for the preface so my name is somewhat hard

59:21.440 --> 59:27.360
to pronounce i didn't have any problem with it i did it perfectly when you read it how's it spelled

59:27.360 --> 59:35.920
it's spelled like elisa with one s okay so with a y or an i with a y a l y s a that's a trap and my

59:35.920 --> 59:41.520
last name is somewhat hard to pronounce it's don't say in the podcast that's too much information

59:41.520 --> 59:49.440
we kept not the word i just said i communicate as many of us do through email sure i work in a

59:49.440 --> 59:55.920
business where word of mouth is super important and i meet people who have heard about me through

59:55.920 --> 01:00:01.520
somebody else or they've gotten an email from me and they think my name is elisa and it's really

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:07.920
awkward for me to try and sure fix so my name is starting to get out there in my business which is

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:15.040
really exciting but it's not really my name yeah right elisa what do i do i so we have the last

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.640
name mcelroy and people have been pronouncing it mckelroy my entire life or mclory is a really

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:27.120
popular way or for whatever reason it's very difficult here and so i've got into the habit

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:34.240
when i say my name which i know people can't spell i will say mcelroy m c e l r o y as soon as i say

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.560
it so when you meet people start training yourself to immediately say elisa as you meet them like ah

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:46.080
hi i'm elisa say your name right off the bat don't give them the opportunity to mispronounce it

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.960
because then it's weird yeah but if they're just like wow elisa's really forward in her introduction

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:56.160
let me try and ease your pain with this and this is gonna sound cool but i want you to really dial

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:03.520
in with me here you compare to some of the other questions tonight it sounds like maybe count your

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:09.280
blessings because there's no listen i want you to really think about this because there was that guy

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.720
who didn't have his soup and he was very sad and then there was a guy with the just beautiful

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:23.920
flawless hands and i forget what his thing was about and then dean's thing was the worst that's

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.280
true by and large you're doing okay yeah maybe try to get more permissive about it just all

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:36.800
right so you you prefer elisa right that is my name that's like the main crux of the whole thing

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.880
okay you prefer elisa what if you open yourself up to some other possibilities

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.000
maybe there's a personality for elisa tell people call me elisa call me elisa just don't call me

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:56.080
late for dinner and then stare them dead in the fucking eye until they turn and you are in control

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.880
what's ironic you're actually 45 minutes late for dinner and they have fucking nothing

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.400
