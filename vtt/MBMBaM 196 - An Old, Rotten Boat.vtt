00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.080
Hello, everyone. Welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.240
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.240 --> 00:58.080
I'm your babiest brother, Griffin McElroy. The countdown is on in just seven days.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.800
Boop. What's in seven days? 420.

01:01.360 --> 01:08.160
Oh, I get it. That's the weed number. Countdown to weed day.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.400
It'll be nice when everyone's finally allowed to have some weed for once.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.480
Is it bad that 420 this year falls on a Sunday?

01:18.800 --> 01:21.920
Not only off Sunday, it's the Sunday.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.600
It's the most Sunday-ass Sunday there is, Easter Sunday.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.720
It's a very Sunday, Sunday.

01:30.240 --> 01:33.520
I think you would feel bad about blazing it.

01:33.520 --> 01:40.560
Hey, what if you saw the Easter bunny and when he came down to your chimney, he was like,

01:40.560 --> 01:44.400
are you going to blaze one? Because it's 420. And you were like, yeah, I am.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.440
He took off the Easter bunny hat and he was Willie Nelson the whole time.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.240
That motherfucker loves eggs.

01:52.240 --> 01:59.040
I haven't weeded ever. Dad, stop listening. In a long time, I haven't had weed.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.720
But when I did, I used to make things out of Starbursts.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.840
I used to smush them. Well, you could smush them together.

02:09.840 --> 02:14.320
And there's a picture on Facebook a long time ago.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.320
I may have removed it at this point of me and I made a horse out of Starbursts.

02:18.320 --> 02:22.880
Yes, that infatuation began a long, long time ago.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.440
And then I'm just sort of putting my mouth over it

02:26.000 --> 02:28.880
as it stands triumphantly on a table and I would party on that.

02:28.880 --> 02:34.880
So I think about this convergence of a day of the year where Starbursts are deployed

02:35.440 --> 02:37.440
in massive numbers.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.680
And then also you get to chief on some gangadank on the side.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.160
If you think about it, it really is a perfect pairing of the two holidays

02:46.160 --> 02:50.400
because it's the only time in which you're going to be fulfilled eating peeps.

02:50.400 --> 02:54.560
Well, it's a miraculous it is actually a miraculous confluence.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.640
Like it should always land on the same day.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.440
Do you guys remember that one year that Ecstasy Day,

03:01.440 --> 03:04.000
which everybody knows is the 51st Tuesday of the year

03:05.600 --> 03:07.840
and Christmas at the same time?

03:07.840 --> 03:10.000
And it's just like the lights.

03:10.000 --> 03:18.160
That plant has lights in and around it.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.920
I get super, super quiet when I when I X out.

03:25.120 --> 03:31.200
So everybody make sure you get your candy and then get your candy for 420

03:31.200 --> 03:34.560
because it's coming and you know that I'm going to celebrate it

03:34.560 --> 03:40.000
like I do every Easter watching Mythbusters with my wife's grandparents.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.360
When are they going to do an Obamacare episode?

03:48.800 --> 03:52.160
I am in need of some witty responses to people I've just met.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.840
The problem is that I have a highly unusual name.

03:56.400 --> 04:02.000
So much so that I've had to pull out ID to prove it's actually my name.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.760
And when I meet new people, I usually get a comment or compliment

04:05.760 --> 04:07.200
about how they like my name.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.360
It's always been awkward for me.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.600
So recently I've started responding with thanks.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.120
I got it for my birthday.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.480
It gets a good response.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.280
Oh, I like that.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.880
I know this line will get old after a while.

04:18.880 --> 04:25.680
So please, brothers, I need some comic genius to come up with new responses.

04:27.200 --> 04:27.680
Fancy.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.160
Yes, it's my real name.

04:30.160 --> 04:34.240
I mean, can you beat them to the punch?

04:34.240 --> 04:39.520
Like when you say, like, my name's Fancy, so this is your one chance.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.560
Don't let me down.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.600
Yeah, I mean, that is I think probably the joke.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.200
All three of us were planning on.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.640
I decided to execute it faster.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.360
I mean, yeah, yeah.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.880
And without any sort of real punch line.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.720
It's more isn't that song about a prostitute.

04:58.720 --> 05:04.400
No, it could be applied to all manner professions.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.640
I always thought it was more like a sort of a geisha host situation.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.240
Yeah, and he was offering the girlfriend experience.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.080
There's no sex exchange.

05:18.080 --> 05:18.960
That's never made.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.040
That's never writ large.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.480
That there is a sexual favors exchange.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.160
She says, just be nice to the gentleman fancy and they'll be nice to you.

05:28.160 --> 05:35.520
I assume she means to offer the girlfriend experience in some sort of Japanese host bar.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.240
It also says, don't give up the butt fancy, though.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.360
In the second, I said not until the fifth date.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.000
In the second bridge, it says, here's your one chance fancy.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.520
Don't give up that butt.

05:45.520 --> 05:50.400
And then that's in the live edit, not in the studio version.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.680
In the earlier EP, in Reba's first EP, there was a lot of anal.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.320
Don't give up the butt for less than three big.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.080
Three big?

06:00.640 --> 06:01.120
Three big.

06:01.120 --> 06:01.760
That's $300.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.080
That's not very big.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.560
I can think of way bigger things than that.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.200
What?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.440
No, three large is 3000.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.360
Three big is 300.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.400
What's three huge?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.640
Three million.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.040
Three is three.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.160
It's three dollars.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.280
Just three dollars.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.880
That is not a fancy price for a butt.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.960
When you tell people your name is fancy and they doubt it, can you say something like,

06:24.960 --> 06:26.400
oh, it's short for fanserson?

06:28.400 --> 06:31.120
Can you correct yourself and be like, oh, I'm sorry, I meant Nancy?

06:31.120 --> 06:33.600
And then just walk away.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.080
Did I say fancy?

06:34.080 --> 06:35.200
It's short for Nancy.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.040
My name is Fnancy.

06:37.840 --> 06:42.080
It's an F apostrophe N, like a Lovecraft name or something.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.360
Can you clarify afterwards?

06:43.360 --> 06:44.480
You know, like the ketchup.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.000
Fancy style.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.760
You don't know some fancy style ketchup.

06:50.480 --> 06:50.640
Sure.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.200
Fancy ketchup.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.120
Yeah, you don't ever want plain style ketchup.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.000
It's just red water.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.040
Fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.200
It's a fun name to say.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.680
Oh, oh, Griffin, you just made me think of something.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.520
Maybe just say your name so much that it loses all meaning.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.320
Oh, my God.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.760
And they can't know if I guess you.

07:08.640 --> 07:14.400
Maybe you said they go, it's Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy.

07:19.040 --> 07:19.520
You could become-

07:19.520 --> 07:21.520
And then they walk away and you lose face.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.520
Yeah, you could become the president of our United States of America

07:25.520 --> 07:28.720
and then that name would be sort of the same concept,

07:28.720 --> 07:31.200
like the name would be so normalized at that point because it's like-

07:32.080 --> 07:32.560
Right.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.040
You know what I mean?

07:33.040 --> 07:34.000
Like you guys-

07:34.000 --> 07:36.080
Like there had to be an uptick of like Baracks.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.600
Yeah, or like-

07:37.600 --> 07:38.560
Barack Obama.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.120
At the very least, like when somebody names a kid Barack,

07:41.120 --> 07:44.480
it's not like the Mortal Kombat fighter.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.000
Like, no, that's Baraka, stop it.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.800
Gear shit together.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.760
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.080
Okay, I don't know what to tell Fancy.

07:54.960 --> 07:55.440
That's a tough call.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.120
I really like saying it.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.000
I know, I do too.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.720
Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.040
Okay.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.800
Which episode of our Brother of a Brother should I start with?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.000
Try 196.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.400
They say Fancy over and over again for three minutes.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.800
What if, okay, here's what you do.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.840
Tell them your name is Fancy.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.880
And when they're like, Fancy, say, well, that's my middle name.

08:20.880 --> 08:21.680
And I go by that.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.680
And then they say, what's your first name?

08:23.680 --> 08:25.360
And I want you to say Exquisite.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.880
I'm Exquisite Fancy Delight.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.240
That's my name.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.640
Sounds like a cat food brand, but it's not.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.400
It's a name for me.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.600
It's a name for me.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.280
I got it for my birthday.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.880
And then they'll be too busy laughing.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.040
I'm a 20 year old Australian man.

08:45.040 --> 08:50.560
And I recently got my first credit card, having been using debit to pay for things since I was 16.

08:50.560 --> 08:56.880
Growing up, I have seen friends and family get into all sorts of nasty trouble and don't want this to happen to me.

08:56.880 --> 09:03.440
What is some advice you can give me to avoid poor spending decisions and build my credit rating without being swallowed by debt?

09:03.440 --> 09:07.840
Much love, credit concern in Sydney and hotching, have you ever come to the right place?

09:07.840 --> 09:13.440
For, I mean, don't make, don't paint this all out to be like fucking debtors.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.440
We didn't all fall in that Venus flag trap.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.800
Two of the three of us are really bad at credit.

09:23.200 --> 09:28.240
Here, let me break this down for apparently the question asker and my two older brothers.

09:29.120 --> 09:37.120
If you have five dollars, you can spend five dollars on your credit card at the very maximum.

09:37.120 --> 09:41.280
Probably don't because you'll probably need some of that money for other things.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.840
But if you just have the five, then don't spend six.

09:46.560 --> 09:50.720
Here, here's, I was taught this by my wife where she is much smarter than me.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.480
And here's what you do.

09:53.200 --> 10:00.080
You put an auto debit on your credit card for like a phone bill or your gas bill or your electric bill,

10:00.080 --> 10:04.960
and then an auto debit at the end of the month on your credit card to pay it off with your debit card.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.320
So a bill that you were already going to pay with your debit card,

10:08.320 --> 10:11.440
you pay with your credit card and then you just pay that off at the end of every month.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.400
If you have an open account, don't close it.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.240
If you have a card that you're not going to use anymore, don't close the account.

10:20.240 --> 10:25.040
Just leave it open because again, that's more available credit, which is good for you.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.760
Travis's suggestion, well really, let's be honest,

10:27.760 --> 10:29.760
Teresa's suggestion is a good one.

10:29.760 --> 10:35.280
I use that for some subscription things just to keep the credit rolling.

10:35.280 --> 10:39.440
Here's a helpful suggestion from Travis from my life experience.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.040
Buy, invest in hams.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.280
Don't invest in hams, Travis.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.560
When you, when you charge things to your credit card,

10:47.760 --> 10:55.040
remember that you owe the credit card people money and don't forget to pay it for months on end.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.720
That's great.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.120
Yeah.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.400
That's great advice.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.280
Remember to pay your credit card bill.

11:01.280 --> 11:01.760
Don't forget.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.400
Don't fuck up because-

11:04.400 --> 11:05.760
Don't be a fuck up.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.560
Don't be a fuck up because I, that's what I did.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.640
I like, I did live the first-

11:10.640 --> 11:18.160
Can you drop 25 years of my life just not believing that it would catch up?

11:19.760 --> 11:21.200
No, I completely agree.

11:21.200 --> 11:25.840
I was trying, I was taking that like Tim McGraw song literally.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.640
Like I was spending-

11:26.640 --> 11:27.840
It wasn't even out yet.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.360
It wasn't out yet.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.800
I was still like, I was investing in the production of that record.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.000
Like that's how bad it was.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.080
Like, yeah, I'll pay for you to make a CD, Tim.

11:36.080 --> 11:36.640
What's it called?

11:36.640 --> 11:37.600
Live Like You're Dying?

11:37.600 --> 11:38.640
I approve.

11:38.640 --> 11:44.480
I was, I mean, I got in really bad trouble like with credit card and I ran up a huge bill

11:44.480 --> 11:45.520
and then I couldn't pay it.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.000
And it seemed like this is how to get shit.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.160
Cause they've, they extended, basically I signed up for a credit card.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.920
This is how fucked our country is and me.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.320
I'm not going to take the blame for this.

11:56.320 --> 12:00.160
I signed up for a credit card at a Reds game to get a free hat.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.800
And my parents were like, I guess.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.760
And I was 16.

12:03.760 --> 12:04.080
Okay.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.720
Sounds like a lot of people fucked up in this situation.

12:06.720 --> 12:06.960
Yes.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.360
Everybody's-

12:07.360 --> 12:09.280
A hat to ruin the rest of your life?

12:09.280 --> 12:10.080
Yeah, sure.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.200
Cool hat though.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.000
Great hat.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.120
Is this snapback?

12:13.120 --> 12:18.400
By the time I was in college and working 15 hours a week at Best Buy.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.120
No big deal.

12:19.120 --> 12:19.360
Sorry.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.960
15 hours a week at Babbage's.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.080
Why do you need a credit card?

12:22.080 --> 12:24.160
You have all the money in the world.

12:24.160 --> 12:24.880
Well, good news.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.760
My credit limit was extended to $5,000.

12:27.760 --> 12:37.760
I literally believed that there were two guys working at Chase.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.280
Like, I look at this dumb shit.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.360
I bet if I jack it up, he'll, yep, he did.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.000
He did it.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.560
He did it.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.680
He filled it up again.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.800
He spent more.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.680
Oh, he went over.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.320
He just bought a $30 bag of Doritos.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.600
What a dipshit.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.800
I hate this guy.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.840
No, I had a huge-

12:51.840 --> 12:56.480
I mean, it got to the point where the interest was building faster and I could pay it off.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.640
And I eventually had to get, like, alone.

12:58.640 --> 12:59.760
Did they have bankruptcy?

12:59.760 --> 13:02.000
Oh, no, not bankruptcy.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.080
I had to get a loan to pay my shit so I could finally pay the shit off.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.000
I had to do that, like, that, like, meet them in the middle thing where they're like, well,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.600
we're never getting our money out of this guy.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.880
So just, like, be smart about it and believe me, like, if you're listening to this and

13:16.880 --> 13:20.720
you're in, like, a scenario where you think it's never going to catch up with you because,

13:20.720 --> 13:22.160
like, that's for adults.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.760
It's an adult issue.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.320
Like, you will eventually be an adult, I promise you.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.120
That's how it works.

13:27.120 --> 13:31.600
And now that I have monitoring on my credit score, I really get into it because, like,

13:31.600 --> 13:35.440
my credit score is decent now because, like, I'm watching it all the time and, like, seeing,

13:35.440 --> 13:36.880
oh, cool, I'm up a little bit.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.160
Here's the other important thing.

13:38.160 --> 13:43.440
Hey, young listeners who are just starting off on the road to good credit, it takes,

13:43.440 --> 13:50.000
like, one fuck up, one, like, miss payment, you know, one collection thing, and then,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.080
like, seven years to build that back up.

13:52.080 --> 13:56.160
I lapsed on my student loans, which I didn't even need because I had the

13:56.160 --> 13:56.880
promise scholarship.

13:56.880 --> 14:02.640
Everything was paid for except for my video games and shit.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.480
And I was like, $7,000 for free?

14:04.480 --> 14:05.760
Fuck yeah.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.960
Fuck no.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.400
That was a bad move.

14:09.120 --> 14:12.000
That did not go well for this guy.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.440
Does anybody, do any of the three of us have better credit scores than our wives?

14:16.000 --> 14:16.480
No.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.720
Rachel beat the shit out of me, which sucks because when you go in for a home loan, they

14:20.720 --> 14:21.920
go with the lowest persons.

14:21.920 --> 14:27.440
And so Rachel was like, did her credit test and was like, oh, $1,450.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.640
I didn't even know it could go that high.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.120
That's better than I did on the SATs.

14:31.680 --> 14:35.920
I just got a red, frowny face sticker that says no, no, no.

14:36.960 --> 14:42.480
I literally, when I called, so after I paid off my car and I needed, I think the car is

14:42.480 --> 14:47.280
broken, I needed to buy a new car, I called the credit union that I got in my first car

14:47.280 --> 14:50.800
loan with and said, like, hey, I'm interested in buying a car and I wanted to see if I could.

14:50.800 --> 14:58.720
And my representative just laughed and went, no, no, no.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.720
Here's how stupid this stuff ends.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.800
I'm sorry about this completely unfunny 10 minutes you've all listened to, but maybe

15:04.800 --> 15:05.840
someone will get something out of it.

15:07.840 --> 15:15.680
When we went to buy a house, I had like this horrendous, horrendous credit history, right?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.640
And I was working.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.040
I didn't even have like a full time job.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.840
I was basically a contractor with AOL.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.800
I didn't have like a salaried position, right?

15:26.800 --> 15:32.960
And I had $6,000 that I spent on nothing, I mean, nothing in college.

15:32.960 --> 15:39.360
$6,000 of debt, had student loans, had all this shit and a terrible credit history.

15:39.360 --> 15:47.360
But I was still better than Sidney because Sidney had over $100,000 in med school loans.

15:47.360 --> 15:53.200
And it's like, if you as a bank could just make the next logical leap, you would see

15:53.200 --> 15:56.480
that she is probably a much more sound investment than myself.

15:56.480 --> 16:02.800
Or maybe they assumed like this jerk spent $6,000 on Pringles and beef jerky, so she

16:02.800 --> 16:09.360
must have spent $100,000 on Pringles and beef jerky and not all the goddamn doctor knowledge

16:09.360 --> 16:11.200
that she put inside her fucking skull.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.960
Just don't, please.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.480
Don't spend any money.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.880
Don't spend any money for any reason.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.960
Just make wise decisions and always be working towards the goal of having good credit.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.040
And you will do just fine.

16:27.040 --> 16:27.840
Just get on Mint.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.800
What are we talking about?

16:28.800 --> 16:29.520
Just get on Mint.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.960
They'll take care of all this shit for you.

16:30.960 --> 16:31.920
It's the best website.

16:32.720 --> 16:37.280
Man, how long until we get our show on Saturday mornings on NPR telling people about finance

16:37.280 --> 16:37.760
and shit?

16:38.320 --> 16:39.120
We're gurus.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.240
We're credit gurus.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.040
Credit gurus.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.880
How about Yahoo?

16:44.880 --> 16:45.440
Yeah.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.200
This Yahoo was sent in by Mike Burrows.

16:47.200 --> 16:47.600
Thanks, Mike.

16:47.600 --> 16:54.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Happy, who asks, why are most people's parents so dorky?

16:56.240 --> 16:58.720
So throughout the years, I meet people's parents.

16:58.720 --> 17:02.960
I must say that 99% of them are very dorky.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.960
Where did these people grow up?

17:04.960 --> 17:06.720
What did they grow up around?

17:06.720 --> 17:09.600
They just look so out of place in my situations and events.

17:09.600 --> 17:14.400
For example, when I get invited to weddings, I see a beautiful girl getting married.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.440
And then see her parents, and I go, what in the world?

17:17.440 --> 17:18.880
She came from those two?

17:19.680 --> 17:21.680
It just doesn't match up.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.720
Even with friends, I have met their parents.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.560
They are very, very dorky.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.880
You look at them, and then you say, how in the world did this guy end up with such dorky

17:30.880 --> 17:31.920
parents?

17:31.920 --> 17:32.560
Thoughts?

17:32.560 --> 17:37.200
He's got a point.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.880
Like, most fucking parents are big nerds, though.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.320
This is Dork Patrol, you know what I mean?

17:42.320 --> 17:43.120
This is absolutely true.

17:43.120 --> 17:43.920
Absolutely true.

17:43.920 --> 17:44.800
But you know what, guys?

17:45.840 --> 17:49.120
I am four months away-ish, less.

17:49.120 --> 17:54.000
God, like, yeah, about four months away from the birth of my daughter, okay?

17:54.640 --> 18:01.600
And I have to tell you, the reason that parents are, look the way, are dorky is because if

18:01.600 --> 18:07.600
they're anything like me, I have gotten to a point where I'm just, I'm just out.

18:08.720 --> 18:17.040
I'm just out of the, what you see as a dorky and out of touch parent is a person who is

18:17.040 --> 18:18.560
just out of the game.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.040
Which game are we, which game?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.240
The game.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.320
It's a running joke, right?

18:24.320 --> 18:27.680
That when you, when you get married or you get into like a serious committed relationship,

18:27.680 --> 18:29.200
you let yourself go a little bit, right?

18:29.200 --> 18:31.120
Because it's like, oh, I found the person.

18:31.120 --> 18:36.400
I have to imagine it's like that with kids, but 20 times that of like, oh, I'm never

18:36.400 --> 18:37.440
gonna be cool again.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.160
Bye, everybody.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.840
I don't think it's talking about, I don't think it has anything to do with weight, though.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.680
I think it's just like, you don't-

18:43.680 --> 18:46.160
No, I'm not saying parents are fat, I'm saying-

18:46.160 --> 18:48.640
How come all parents are super fat?

18:48.640 --> 18:55.120
I just, I'm saying that you reach a point where just like you are sort of preternaturally

18:55.120 --> 18:59.040
drawn to lighter shades of jeans.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.640
You are just going to wear lighter and lighter and lighter jeans.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.680
You know what I mean?

19:03.680 --> 19:06.160
Like a pale robin's egg blue.

19:06.160 --> 19:11.280
I feel bad for the people that are in the game constantly having to be in the game.

19:11.840 --> 19:17.200
For me, I married a beautiful, intelligent doctor, right?

19:17.200 --> 19:21.920
I am Garth Brooks and I have had my platinum records.

19:21.920 --> 19:26.800
I am now in my Chris Gaines phase where I just kind of do what the fuck ever, because

19:26.800 --> 19:27.840
who cares?

19:27.840 --> 19:29.520
Who cares?

19:29.520 --> 19:30.880
I'm already out the game.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.960
I finished the game.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.120
Chris Gaines looked super good, though.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.000
He looked so cool.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.760
He also was non-existent.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.920
He looked super great with a little bit of scruff in his emo hair.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.200
I'm just saying, what I'm saying is that I'm out.

19:45.200 --> 19:45.680
I'm done.

19:45.680 --> 19:50.400
I might dip back in to see how the game's going, but like there had to be, for me, there

19:50.400 --> 19:59.200
was a moment of, and it's been constantly reinforced, because I would be, when I was

19:59.200 --> 20:04.000
a younger person, I would think, how are you older people not into this thing?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.760
You're missing out on so much.

20:06.400 --> 20:17.600
Now I have a 13-year-old sister-in-law who will get into stuff like Snapchat or Instagram.

20:17.600 --> 20:21.200
Whoa, Riley's on Snapchat?

20:21.200 --> 20:24.400
I don't think she's actually on Snapchat, but anyway, that service guy bad rap.

20:24.400 --> 20:29.840
Anyway, she's on Instagram or whatever, and I think for me the moment was Pinterest.

20:29.840 --> 20:35.280
I decided that I don't know what that is, and I'm not gonna know what it is.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.960
And I'm not willing to find out.

20:36.960 --> 20:41.280
And I'm not willing to find out, so the game can keep going, and I'm just gonna be back

20:41.280 --> 20:41.840
here.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.520
I finished my rounds.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.800
Now it's somebody else's turn.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.640
I'm not gonna get dipped back in.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.800
You have to realize, though, that that idea of like, what are you into now?

20:50.800 --> 20:51.360
Okay.

20:51.360 --> 20:55.600
And dipping back in to check and see how stuff's going, that's what this question asker is

20:55.600 --> 20:56.560
talking about.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.600
That's the nerd shit.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.400
That's the, ah, Pinterest, let me just pin my kids.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.160
Hey, kids, got some pins for you.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.360
Push, push, push, push, push.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.200
That's what you do.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.040
You push pins into your children.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.320
That's at Pinterest?

21:08.320 --> 21:09.360
To punish them.

21:09.360 --> 21:09.760
To punish.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.640
For Snapchatting.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.360
For Snapchat.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.640
I caught you Snapchatting.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.520
Come over here.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.800
Got some thumbtacks.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.680
Not the tacks again.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.680
Gonna put them on the bottom of your shoes.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.040
Turn you into a little Ben Vereen.

21:23.680 --> 21:27.760
That's how I'll punish my children, is I'll turn them into unsuspecting tap dancers.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.800
Just trust me on this, that like, grown ups, parents are not as bothered by how out of

21:38.800 --> 21:41.520
the game they are as you.

21:41.520 --> 21:45.840
Like, you would not go out of the house in pants up to your belly button.

21:45.840 --> 21:46.640
They don't care.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.080
They're out.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.760
But that's not every parent.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.320
Here's what I can't wrap my mind around.

21:52.320 --> 21:56.560
I feel like right now, in this moment in time, for at least the next four goddamn months

21:56.560 --> 22:02.240
before Justin ruins this whole dynamic that we have going, I feel like the three of us

22:02.240 --> 22:07.200
are not nerds and we're not super, like, trying to be super cool.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.840
We are at this very comfortable medium.

22:09.840 --> 22:14.640
We are at this very, like, nice mid zone between those two extremes.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.440
Our density is such that we're floating on the oil but below the water.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.400
But below the water.

22:20.400 --> 22:24.000
That cool ass water and that nerdy stupid oil.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.600
We're somewhere in the middle there.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.520
I don't think once you become a parent, you can maintain that equilibrium.

22:29.520 --> 22:36.880
You go either like, hey, Kent, or like, Harry Styles, like, fucking one way or the other.

22:36.880 --> 22:41.120
And I'm terrified of that.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.600
Yeah, I've always been so cool.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.640
I'm worried.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.120
I'm not saying you're cool.

22:47.120 --> 22:47.920
I'm not saying you're cool.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.600
You're kind of a fucking dweebo.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.280
But you're not a huge dweebo.

22:51.280 --> 22:51.840
You know what I mean?

22:52.560 --> 22:58.160
We're the goddamn day walkers of coolness.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.480
And like, I don't think parents can maintain that shit.

23:00.480 --> 23:05.120
They either try super, super hard and I've met some cool ass parents.

23:05.120 --> 23:09.440
Or they become fucking Rick Moranis in My Other Dad.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.240
What's that movie called?

23:11.120 --> 23:11.760
My Other Dad.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.600
Got it in one.

23:14.720 --> 23:19.200
I love, you know, every so often whenever we do these questions, it's always weird to

23:19.200 --> 23:23.440
me, like, the one detail that really sticks in my mind from the question.

23:23.440 --> 23:27.760
And in this one, it's 99% of parents he meets.

23:27.760 --> 23:31.840
Because that means this dude's met at least 100 parents.

23:31.840 --> 23:35.360
And 99 of them were dorks.

23:35.360 --> 23:35.920
Yeah.

23:35.920 --> 23:40.160
Otherwise, he's like cutting people in half or he's judging people like a quarter of them

23:40.160 --> 23:42.480
was pretty dorky, but the rest of it was okay.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.640
Dan said some cool shit once.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.320
I'm going to bump that down to 99%, not 100%.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.560
Most of the time, though.

23:50.560 --> 23:56.400
I just, I feel like that once I have a kid, I'm going to try to be as uncool as possible.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.480
But not in an aggressive way.

23:58.480 --> 24:02.480
I want to be cool in like a constant, steadfast, reliable way.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.840
You can always trust Justin to say something dorky.

24:06.560 --> 24:10.320
No, not to say something like, I am just going to crystallize.

24:10.320 --> 24:16.560
And maybe, like, we have people who have done that in the world, like celebrities, for example,

24:16.560 --> 24:21.600
who have crystallized exactly where they are, and then the world comes back around.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.880
They find them again.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.600
Look, I have a great example for you, Sam Elliott.

24:25.600 --> 24:33.040
Sam Elliott got to 1973, and he's like, well, this is who I am.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.000
This is where I get off.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.440
I'm going to trap my whole spirit in a magical painting.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.200
Okay, Sam Elliott.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.360
I'm just going to live here.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.000
I'm going to keep the stash exactly like it is.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.720
It's 1973, and I'm going to stay right here.

24:46.720 --> 24:51.520
I'm going to get a Mantis alien monster to freeze me in his crystals.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.320
Maybe I'll meet y'all down that trail.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.600
Maybe I won't, but I will be exactly here.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.520
See you guys in Ghost Rider.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.000
I will check you all in Ghost Rider.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.320
He is the proverbial ribbon that we tied around a tree in the forest, like, where are we?

25:06.320 --> 25:07.600
Oh, there's Sam Elliott.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.360
Sam Elliott is our constant.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.640
He is our constant.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.960
I'm saying that Sam Elliott got off.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.200
He was like, well, this is working for me pretty good.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.800
I'm just going to hop off here.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.480
And then we come back around.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.240
Big Lebowski comes back around.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.560
Uh, Parson Wreck comes back around.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.960
We all come back around and say, hey, is Sam Elliott still?

25:26.960 --> 25:27.600
Yes, he is.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.000
Yes, he is.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.840
He's still exactly right there.

25:29.840 --> 25:30.720
He's cool again.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.880
That's going to be me, I think.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.200
Eventually, maybe in 2040.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.200
You feel comfortable just go ahead and throwing out that you're going to be the Sam Elliott of the future?

25:39.200 --> 25:43.280
You're comfortable saying that you, right now, you are cool with forever.

25:43.280 --> 25:47.120
No improvements, no tweaks, no changes, no chopping, no screwing.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.600
What I'm saying is that if society gets to a point in 2040 where they're like,

25:51.600 --> 25:52.880
you know what we need?

25:52.880 --> 25:55.680
We need to find a chubby guy in a Night Trap t-shirt.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.480
That'd be cool.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.720
I'd be like, well, if only someone had locked that down 30 years.

26:02.720 --> 26:03.680
Lock that down.

26:03.680 --> 26:08.720
And then they'll be going through like microfiche and they'll find like an old newspaper clipping

26:08.720 --> 26:10.320
of me like this guy.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.760
There's no way he's still.

26:11.760 --> 26:12.320
He is.

26:12.880 --> 26:18.160
He's been waiting here with his friend, Sam Elliott and his daughter who loves him just the way he is.

26:18.160 --> 26:23.200
Oh, hey, Justin, why don't you throw Wirehead Ned into the Sega CD?

26:24.320 --> 26:25.440
No problem, Sam.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.040
Hey, Sam, you want to listen to some new music?

26:29.600 --> 26:30.960
Absolutely not.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.320
Don't go against our bargain.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.120
Listen, you know the rules of staying in my lodge.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.440
Basically, it's basically full house.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.960
If you evolve, you have to leave.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.360
Stagnation is the word.

26:43.360 --> 26:47.440
What's the wash word here at Sam Elliott's stagnation lodge?

26:47.440 --> 26:51.840
I only want to listen to live slide guitar and watch you play full motion video games.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.920
Justin, we got any more of that good sarsaparilla?

26:58.480 --> 26:59.280
Check the cooler.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.160
Have you figured out which kind of TV dad you're going to be?

27:02.160 --> 27:04.960
Like on the TV dad spectrum where you're going to land?

27:06.800 --> 27:08.240
I hope you go Carl Winslow.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.000
I was thinking Carl Winslow.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.920
I'm going to go Breaking Bad, I think.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.280
Oh, Justin.

27:13.280 --> 27:13.920
I'm sorry.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.760
Got to get that paper.

27:15.760 --> 27:24.800
I'm a guy in my 30s who got into cycling a few years ago as a way to stay fit and keep busy.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.320
I've really grown to love it and I try to do it as much as possible.

27:28.320 --> 27:31.440
Problem is I want to incorporate this activity into things I love doing,

27:31.440 --> 27:34.640
like getting coffee or visiting the local microbrewery.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.760
In order to do this, I would have to go to these public places all sweaty and clad in my Lycra

27:39.760 --> 27:40.240
shorts.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.040
Am I good?

27:41.040 --> 27:46.320
Am I allowed to both stay fit and drink beer among non-cyclists or do I have to leave the

27:46.320 --> 27:50.640
luxurious Lycra and clicky clacky shoes at home?

27:50.640 --> 27:54.640
Uh-oh, his parents have been dishing out some thumbtack punishment.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.600
That's from a sweaty cyclist in St. Catherine's, Canada.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.720
My inclination of this is to say fuck it.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.160
Okay.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.280
Well, because like if you get-

28:07.280 --> 28:09.520
Okay, so it would go like this.

28:09.520 --> 28:15.440
It would go like this, you ride your bike down to the coffee shop, you roll in, somebody

28:15.440 --> 28:18.560
sit in the corner, judges you for being a cyclist.

28:19.280 --> 28:24.240
They're judging you for like being fit and enjoying an outdoor activity that's healthy

28:24.240 --> 28:24.800
for you.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.000
I think it depends.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.600
It depends like if you did this in Austin, I think people probably wear Lycra shorts

28:31.600 --> 28:35.760
here sort of recreationally, so I wouldn't sweat it as much.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.480
I mean, you will sweat it.

28:38.480 --> 28:44.080
And I don't understand how you're cool with that.

28:44.080 --> 28:47.680
Like I'm good for you, good on you, getting fit, riding.

28:47.680 --> 28:54.480
I can't understand how you can be so cool with your shorts comfort game being so, so,

28:54.480 --> 28:55.040
so off.

28:57.520 --> 29:03.200
I don't own non-cargo shits because like I need a-

29:03.200 --> 29:04.720
You need to breathe.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.800
It's not even breath.

29:06.800 --> 29:12.320
It's like I just need my whole zone to exist in like a safe spot.

29:12.320 --> 29:12.880
You know what I mean?

29:12.880 --> 29:15.280
Here's the thing, ditto, but here's the thing.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.120
Shorts are comfortable and easy to wear.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.960
And if they're not fitting that description, they ain't shorts.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.680
They ain't shorts.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.200
They're dick prisons or vagina prisons.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.560
There's physical comfort, but there's also like emotional mental comfort.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.680
You know what I mean?

29:29.680 --> 29:35.760
Lycra is emotionally, physically, spiritually, economically unsound

29:35.760 --> 29:39.120
on materials to wrap around your zone.

29:40.320 --> 29:46.320
I see someone, when someone arrives at the same place as me, when they're cycling,

29:46.320 --> 29:48.560
I just, I can't help myself.

29:48.560 --> 29:54.480
I just feel really, I feel really envious, but also perplexed.

29:54.480 --> 29:58.320
Like where, like, I don't understand any of that lifestyle.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.480
Like, where did you, where do you put your bike?

30:01.840 --> 30:03.200
Where did you get a bike?

30:03.200 --> 30:05.600
How do you get your bike over the curb?

30:05.600 --> 30:07.760
That's the thing I could honestly never master.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.040
What do you do?

30:09.040 --> 30:10.240
How did, where do you put it?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.480
What if somebody steals it?

30:12.480 --> 30:13.120
You're stuck.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.760
Well, I live here now, I guess.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.040
I live here.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.080
God damn it.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.040
I'm a ghost.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.680
I don't know how anybody gets into the biking lifestyle, but it seems like really,

30:24.240 --> 30:24.960
I don't know.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.080
It seems like cool.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.840
Like Dave Lavender, our buddy Dave Lavender from the hairless batch,

30:29.840 --> 30:31.360
he rides his bike like everywhere.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.960
Every time he shows up, I feel bad.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.040
I start, it's like self doubt.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.080
I'm like, I don't know.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.280
I guess I could have ridden a bike.

30:39.280 --> 30:42.400
I don't have one, but if I had one, I guess I could have ridden it.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.440
I didn't need to drive.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.400
He rolls up like sup, I got here for free and I lost a pound.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.320
You did that?

30:48.320 --> 30:49.760
You did that coming here?

30:50.320 --> 30:57.040
You just did that and getting, like I got here and it cost me $45 in gas and I got fatter.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.920
Cause of course I'm going to eat those combos I left in the glove compartment.

30:59.920 --> 31:00.420
Okay.

31:01.280 --> 31:05.040
My big fear about biking everywhere is what if I get to a hill?

31:05.760 --> 31:08.720
Cause then I would have to, I'd have to call a cab.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.760
You need a Google maps where it has like traffic.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.440
It can be like, this is, this has a four degree incline.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.360
Like, ah, fuck find alternate route.

31:17.920 --> 31:23.120
This will take you on a toll road and it'll take you four hours longer, but there's no hills.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.640
But it's flat all the way.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.240
Flat a hundred percent of the way.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.320
Oh man.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.360
I wish I could bike.

31:29.360 --> 31:31.680
I really do wish I could bike.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.040
Cause like, I don't know.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.640
It's like a two wheeled horse.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.320
You get that freedom, that wind in your hair.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.520
And like, I love that shit.

31:37.520 --> 31:41.040
But like really, how do you get it up on the curb?

31:41.040 --> 31:43.600
You could do that sweet move where you kind of skid to a stop and

31:43.600 --> 31:46.560
slide sideways and gravel sprays out into the nerd's face.

31:46.560 --> 31:46.800
Right.

31:46.800 --> 31:50.560
I will have to do that every time I get to a curb because I don't understand how people get there.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.440
Dad tried to teach me that shit when I was like seven years old.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.520
He's like, yeah, you just lift up on the handles and you do like a little

31:55.520 --> 31:57.920
backwards butt scoot and the wheel just goes up and over it.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.280
I'm like, okay, let me give it a try.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.160
Fall dead.

32:00.160 --> 32:00.720
Every time.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.560
So dead.

32:02.560 --> 32:02.960
So dead.

32:02.960 --> 32:06.160
And like, I could do that when I'm seven years old with my goddamn rubbery bones.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.680
I'm all brittle now because I can't drink fucking cow's milk.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.800
That is another thing.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.840
I'm at a point.

32:13.840 --> 32:19.120
I don't know how I got to this point in my life, but like I'm at a point now where a fall could be tragic.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.240
It could be game changer.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.840
Not just tragic, like for you physically health wise, but also tragic.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.040
Like if you see a seven year old crash on a bike, first of all, it's awesome.

32:29.680 --> 32:30.800
Yeah, hysterical.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.960
Second of all, second of all, you look at me like, look at that scrappy kid.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.200
He's probably right into a softball game.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.880
If I fall on a bike, I will be laughed at for a year.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.120
What were you doing on a bike?

32:43.120 --> 32:43.680
I'll end up on a fucking-

32:43.680 --> 32:47.920
Or worse yet, everyone will rush to your side in a very concerned manner.

32:47.920 --> 32:56.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sir, are you okay?

32:56.400 --> 32:56.480
I could deal with that. I would be embarrassed by that.

32:56.480 --> 32:56.960
If I fell here in Austin, I would end up on like the front page of a zine.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.920
I would be laughed out of town on a rail.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.200
Be that they would put me on because they wouldn't trust me with bikes anymore.

33:05.840 --> 33:10.480
There are so many like bike literate cities that if you fuck up a bike here,

33:10.480 --> 33:15.760
if you fuck up a bike in a super bike literate city, your bike ability will be revoked and you

33:15.760 --> 33:17.360
and you will have to get on a Razor scooter

33:17.360 --> 33:18.960
and that won't last long either.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.320
Huntington has a bike lane now, I don't.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.800
Just the one on one street?

33:26.800 --> 33:29.560
No, I mean downtown there's a lot of bike lanes

33:29.560 --> 33:32.440
and the way people have decided to use that

33:32.440 --> 33:36.760
is that drivers just get like super luxurious

33:36.760 --> 33:39.080
about opening their doors when they get out of their car.

33:39.080 --> 33:43.720
Oh, this is fantastic, I might be gonna look.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.560
I got room to breathe.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.240
Woosh, woosh.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.400
I'm gonna check.

33:52.240 --> 33:53.440
Let's go to Mighty Fine.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.440
Who do we got a message for?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.960
This message is for Chris and it's from Esme,

34:07.960 --> 34:09.760
which is an awesome name.

34:09.760 --> 34:12.240
And Esme says, you are my best pal

34:12.240 --> 34:14.680
and ultimate co-host of Four Star Dog.

34:14.680 --> 34:18.280
Having you in my life and my pack makes me one lucky gal.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.920
Here's to ultimate laughs to our old and shriveled.

34:20.920 --> 34:21.920
What is Four Star Dog?

34:21.920 --> 34:26.200
Is that a podcast that they just sneak in some advertising?

34:26.200 --> 34:28.140
How could you do this, Esme?

34:30.240 --> 34:31.420
It's not popping up.

34:31.420 --> 34:34.600
Maybe it's an underground, maybe it's on the deep web.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.880
Ooh, Esme, I'm gonna look that shit up.

34:36.880 --> 34:37.960
I will be very cross.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.580
I mean, we said it and did it.

34:39.580 --> 34:40.420
It's been broadcast.

34:40.420 --> 34:42.880
If you have a Silk Road podcast, I'm gonna be very.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.160
I got a message for Jeff from Steve.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.560
Steve says, happy birthday.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.060
You definitely have a birthday sometime this year.

34:51.060 --> 34:53.120
I hope this message reaches you in time,

34:53.120 --> 34:57.280
which is unexpectedly sort of intense for a birthday message.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.520
But anyway, thanks to you and Caroline

34:59.520 --> 35:03.000
for being great friends and introducing me to Bim Bam.

35:03.000 --> 35:03.960
That's the name of our show.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.720
How did you have fucking problems saying that?

35:05.720 --> 35:09.400
You've all set back my dissertation hundreds of hours.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.080
I hope life is good in Chicago.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.320
Here's to more beer, more trivia,

35:13.320 --> 35:16.040
and more tennis in 2014.

35:16.040 --> 35:20.000
Two of those things are awesome.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.400
Two of those I was into.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.320
Sure.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.020
So happy birthday, Jeff,

35:24.020 --> 35:26.240
whenever that happy day should occur.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.480
And how about we tennis?

35:29.480 --> 35:31.580
How about a little bit of we tennis?

35:31.580 --> 35:33.000
How about we tennis?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.720
Puff, puff, serve.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.480
So guys, did you notice how, puff, puff, serve.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.280
Thank you, thank you.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.260
Travis always has a secret joke in there

35:44.260 --> 35:45.100
that's like super funny.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.300
That really does happen every week.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.140
Well, we miss it completely.

35:47.140 --> 35:49.560
Every week someone tweets something at us like, what?

35:49.560 --> 35:50.440
That's hysterical.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.280
What was it last week?

35:51.280 --> 35:54.120
Somebody tweeted and I was like, fuck, that's good.

35:54.120 --> 35:54.960
And then they were like, yeah,

35:54.960 --> 35:58.200
Travis said that out loud to you during the show

35:58.200 --> 35:59.680
and you fucked it and you missed it.

35:59.680 --> 36:00.520
It was the piano mandate.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.560
Listen, when you said as much shit as I did

36:02.560 --> 36:03.400
on a piano mandate.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.880
We were talking about the Billy Joel station

36:04.880 --> 36:06.320
and said it was called the piano mandate

36:06.320 --> 36:09.640
and Justin and I were just like, well, here's our joke.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.480
That's hysterical.

36:10.480 --> 36:11.320
That's hysterical.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.320
Okay, so there's a channel that plays all Billy Joel.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.160
So it's okay.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.720
Still hasn't changed, by the way.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.400
Thanks serious XM really made me believe in myself.

36:19.400 --> 36:23.400
Did you guys notice how I was on time for the show today?

36:23.400 --> 36:27.000
Did you notice that I was a little late,

36:27.000 --> 36:28.560
but I wasn't as late as normal.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.320
That's because I was grabbing a shave before

36:31.320 --> 36:34.040
and normally I do the wet shaving thing.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.760
It takes me like a hundred years to do that.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.880
I do the wet shaving thing, it takes me like a hundred years.

36:39.880 --> 36:44.880
And today I tried a kit from Harry's.com,

36:44.920 --> 36:48.020
which is they give you their support of the show.

36:48.020 --> 36:50.440
They deliver a better shaving experience

36:50.440 --> 36:53.400
for just a fraction of the price.

36:53.400 --> 36:56.160
I got this great, it's a great razor,

36:56.160 --> 36:57.840
a lovely tube of shaving cream,

36:57.840 --> 37:00.640
some really funny shaving instructions and backup razor.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.600
Can you explain the funny shaving instructions?

37:03.600 --> 37:04.440
They're funny.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.260
I mean, it's funny.

37:05.260 --> 37:06.800
It's humorous, like in a funny way.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.600
It's a funny, it's a funny shavings.

37:08.600 --> 37:09.520
I don't know, what do you want?

37:09.520 --> 37:13.360
I usually don't jam on like, just like, you know, razor,

37:13.360 --> 37:15.760
cause I have a very sensitive skin

37:15.760 --> 37:18.940
and it tends to break out if I just use like a regular razor,

37:18.940 --> 37:20.560
but that thing was dope.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.600
Like the razor we got from Harry's

37:22.600 --> 37:24.120
gave me such a smooth shave

37:24.120 --> 37:26.640
and it was very gentle on my delicate skin.

37:26.640 --> 37:30.160
It's a convenient and get it online for 15 bucks.

37:30.160 --> 37:34.200
You get that kit that we got, it's in a really pretty box

37:34.200 --> 37:38.400
and it includes a handle, three blades and shaving cream

37:38.400 --> 37:39.680
and shipped right to your door.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.520
It's like half the price.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.120
Three German engineered blades.

37:43.120 --> 37:48.120
So you know that they are made of hard metals

37:48.620 --> 37:50.360
cause that's what Germans love.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.040
That's what Germans love.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.820
It was started by, one of the co-founders is Jeff,

37:54.820 --> 37:57.140
who was the guy who started friend of the show,

37:57.140 --> 37:57.980
Warby Parker.

37:57.980 --> 37:59.160
He knows Warby Parker, I guess.

37:59.160 --> 38:04.160
Your whole face is going to one day be catered to.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.560
This is by Jeff.

38:05.560 --> 38:09.320
Jeff has opened up a septum piercing salon

38:09.320 --> 38:11.120
that you can just go to and get that.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.880
Jeff's an eyeball replacement.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.280
Jeff's my face guy.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.020
Jeff's my, Jeff does my face.

38:17.020 --> 38:20.420
I got Susan, who does my shoulders.

38:21.320 --> 38:22.240
And I want to be clear here.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.160
This is a shave kit for everyone.

38:24.160 --> 38:25.740
My wife enjoys that as well.

38:25.740 --> 38:27.680
So everybody go check it out.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.600
It really is a pretty sweet set and you're going to love it.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.040
Harry's.com and you use the coupon code, my brother.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.680
And that's going to give you, get this.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.020
This is really good.

38:37.020 --> 38:40.400
Harry's can give you $5 off your first purchase

38:40.400 --> 38:42.060
for all our listeners.

38:42.060 --> 38:43.280
My brother is that code.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.700
It's all one word.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.000
And the web address is harrys.com.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.840
So go get your shave on.

38:48.840 --> 38:53.280
I love how many of these righteous organizations

38:53.280 --> 38:54.700
have been supporting us lately.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.360
I do miss the freedom

38:56.360 --> 38:58.200
that extreme restraints afforded us

38:58.200 --> 39:00.200
in being able to choose our own

39:00.200 --> 39:02.260
extremely hackable promo code.

39:04.260 --> 39:06.520
I forget where we left, where we left that.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.440
I forget what the last one.

39:08.440 --> 39:09.800
It was Sexabunga.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.080
Ah, Sexabunga, so good.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.560
So, so much viral promise.

39:14.560 --> 39:19.560
Moving on to once you're smooth shaven,

39:19.880 --> 39:21.320
you want to tell people about it.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.140
How?

39:22.140 --> 39:22.980
Twitter?

39:22.980 --> 39:23.800
No.

39:23.800 --> 39:24.640
Too short.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.480
Facebook?

39:25.480 --> 39:26.520
Tumblr?

39:26.520 --> 39:27.960
No one knows what that is.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.400
Maybe a website brought to you.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.080
MySmoothFace.com.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.160
MySmoothFace.com, a Squarespace joint.

39:35.160 --> 39:38.080
Can I use secret to tell everybody about my smooth face

39:38.080 --> 39:40.120
and then they won't know who has it,

39:40.120 --> 39:41.640
but they will know that one of their friends

39:41.640 --> 39:44.600
is enjoying a very smooth face.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.640
And they'll start going around

39:45.640 --> 39:47.120
touching the faces of all their friends.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.380
Like, nope, it wasn't Roger.

39:49.380 --> 39:51.520
Griffin, while I register that domain,

39:51.520 --> 39:54.620
can you please tell everybody about Squarespace?

39:54.620 --> 39:58.600
Squarespace is a platform that allows you

39:58.600 --> 40:03.400
to make a website, which sounds intimidating.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.240
Doesn't have to be,

40:04.240 --> 40:06.820
because they have really beautiful designs

40:06.820 --> 40:08.760
that you can sort of kick things off with.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.980
And then you have all the style options

40:10.980 --> 40:13.400
that you could ever need or want,

40:13.400 --> 40:15.540
and then you can chop and screw it.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.080
And if you have a problem with that,

40:17.080 --> 40:20.020
because maybe you're not so good at the deep web,

40:20.880 --> 40:22.600
you can contact their support team,

40:22.600 --> 40:24.860
which they have available 24 seven.

40:26.040 --> 40:29.660
And you can make a logo using their logo generator

40:29.660 --> 40:31.900
for your website, a little FAF icon maybe.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.760
And it's just $8 a month,

40:34.760 --> 40:36.300
and that includes a free domain name

40:36.300 --> 40:38.000
if you sign up for a year.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
So Squarespace, it's really good.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.800
They've been a good supporter of the show,

40:42.800 --> 40:44.200
and we've heard from a few people

40:44.200 --> 40:46.600
who made some good looking websites.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.440
It's got responsive design,

40:48.440 --> 40:50.120
so it'll work on any device.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.440
And you can start a trial with no credit card,

40:53.440 --> 40:55.500
and start working on the website.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.280
Just go to squarespace.com,

40:57.280 --> 40:59.760
and use the offer code mybrother, all one word.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.120
That's my brother, all one word,

41:02.120 --> 41:07.000
to get 10% off your first purchase, your first purse.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.380
Your first purse.

41:08.380 --> 41:10.080
And yeah, that's great.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.240
Maybe you wanna do like firstpurse.com.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.080
Listen guys.

41:13.080 --> 41:13.900
Sell some first purses.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.200
Please, I just got my smooth face.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.240
I can't even get first purse too.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.200
Listen, the web sucks, but Squarespace

41:20.200 --> 41:24.140
is gonna let you fix it one website at a time.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.480
That's not the tagline that they gave us,

41:26.480 --> 41:28.200
but it's the one that I'm giving them.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.920
It's the one we deserve.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.140
It's, the web is not great lately.

41:32.140 --> 41:34.840
I don't know if you guys have been keeping up with it.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.880
All of my sites are,

41:37.920 --> 41:40.400
their posting schedules have become so erratic, and.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.960
Homestar Runner doesn't update enough.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.600
They did update it earlier this month.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.160
They deployed the first update in like nine years.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.000
God, I miss Homestar Runner so much.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.160
Hold on just one second.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.680
I'm setting up the forward here.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.520
Okay.

41:56.520 --> 41:57.940
Are you really setting, buying?

41:59.360 --> 42:00.400
Just had to grab it real quick

42:00.400 --> 42:02.560
so nobody tries to steal it.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.680
What's the web address?

42:03.680 --> 42:05.000
What's the URL?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.380
MySmoothFace.com.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.120
Try it.

42:09.120 --> 42:14.120
Okay.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.680
And it redirects to my brother, my brother, and me.

42:16.680 --> 42:17.600
What's up?

42:19.720 --> 42:20.840
Try Fart Patrol.

42:25.400 --> 42:28.840
That one redirects to my brother, my brother, and me.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.040
It's a pretty good game.

42:30.040 --> 42:33.180
We'll try Butt Slammers.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.140
All right, go Justin.

42:36.140 --> 42:37.500
Okay.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.660
Butt Slammers is a different thing.

42:41.980 --> 42:43.560
Just super quick.

42:43.560 --> 42:46.740
Want to remind you guys that the second annual

42:46.740 --> 42:49.360
Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival

42:49.360 --> 42:50.640
is brought to you by MaxFun.

42:50.640 --> 42:51.480
It's coming around.

42:51.480 --> 42:54.160
It was a lot of fun the first time.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.080
You guessed, you're assuming,

42:56.080 --> 42:58.480
because you didn't get to go on a particular

42:58.480 --> 43:00.040
nautical adventure.

43:00.040 --> 43:03.480
Yeah, but their ship's gonna set sail

43:03.480 --> 43:06.780
from Port Canaveral for three nights in the Bahamas

43:06.780 --> 43:08.920
July 25th through the 28th.

43:10.240 --> 43:13.520
And it's gonna have Moshe Kasher, Chris Fairbanks,

43:13.520 --> 43:16.360
who's like hysterical if you haven't met the guy.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.880
Kyle Kinane is gonna be there.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.760
He's hysterical.

43:20.760 --> 43:21.600
Chris Fairbanks.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.240
He's the one that almost murdered us with laughter.

43:23.240 --> 43:24.880
With laughter.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.600
Natasha Legaro, Morgan Murphy,

43:26.600 --> 43:27.600
who is also hysterical.

43:27.600 --> 43:28.440
Also fucking great.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.800
John Roderick of the Long Winters,

43:29.800 --> 43:31.720
like from the use of our theme song,

43:31.720 --> 43:32.560
It's a Departure Off the Elm,

43:32.560 --> 43:34.320
but there's been that John Roderick.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.000
He's gonna be like there on a boat

43:36.000 --> 43:37.840
where you just talk to him in BD.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.860
Goddamn, that makes me so angry.

43:39.860 --> 43:42.680
I know, pub quiz, shuffleboard tournament,

43:42.680 --> 43:43.520
lots of fun.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.520
So okay, go to boatparty.biz right now

43:46.520 --> 43:47.360
and get your tickets.

43:47.360 --> 43:50.000
It's gonna be like pretty much the best.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.080
So go do that right now.

43:52.080 --> 43:54.180
I feel like we've been able to keep it pretty cool

43:54.180 --> 43:58.480
if we meet people at Max Fun Con and shit like that,

43:58.480 --> 43:59.920
people we really admire.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.100
I don't think I could lock it down for Roderick.

44:02.100 --> 44:03.740
I do not think.

44:03.740 --> 44:04.580
I do not.

44:04.580 --> 44:06.200
It would be like a reprise of when

44:06.200 --> 44:08.400
Justin and I met John Hodgman

44:08.400 --> 44:11.480
and you embarrassed me just so, so bad.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.200
I did a great job.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.280
You did a really good job of taking a picture of us

44:15.280 --> 44:17.640
over and over again in a dark bar with flash on

44:17.640 --> 44:18.480
over and over and over.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.160
So funny.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.120
I treasure that picture.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.840
It's number one in my camera roll.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.200
Never get rid of it and I'll use it every day.

44:27.400 --> 44:28.720
Hi, my name is Ruchakay Sherway

44:28.720 --> 44:31.160
and I have a podcast called Song Exploder.

44:31.160 --> 44:33.760
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

44:33.760 --> 44:36.520
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.080
You get an inside look into the creative

44:38.080 --> 44:40.320
and technical process and a unique view of a song

44:40.320 --> 44:41.560
by hearing just the drums

44:43.440 --> 44:44.500
or just the guitars

44:45.760 --> 44:47.820
or say just a Wurlitzer piano.

44:50.960 --> 44:52.880
If you're a fan of music, if you make music

44:52.880 --> 44:54.480
or if you just like to learn how things are made,

44:54.480 --> 44:56.580
come check it out on maximumfun.org.

44:56.580 --> 44:57.420
Thanks.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.240
How about a Yahoo?

45:01.240 --> 45:02.140
Yeah, please.

45:02.140 --> 45:05.940
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

45:05.940 --> 45:07.780
Are you Ira Ray?

45:07.780 --> 45:09.300
Who wants to know?

45:09.300 --> 45:10.140
Thank you, Ira Ray.

45:10.140 --> 45:14.820
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mike B. who asks,

45:14.820 --> 45:17.280
who will take over for Jimmy Buffett?

45:19.820 --> 45:22.500
So I'm a huge Jimmy Buffett fan.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.300
I just love his laid back style.

45:24.300 --> 45:25.820
That makes you wish you were on a beach

45:25.820 --> 45:27.820
with a couple coronas and a boat.

45:27.820 --> 45:28.900
So hold up.

45:29.940 --> 45:31.020
Hold on.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.700
Don't, one second, my dude.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.500
You're on a beach.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.140
You're on the beach.

45:36.140 --> 45:38.340
You're on the loamy sands,

45:38.340 --> 45:40.620
kicking back a cup, dual fisting coronas.

45:40.620 --> 45:43.860
And then somewhere there's a boat just like.

45:43.860 --> 45:44.780
I think it's one of those things

45:44.780 --> 45:47.300
where it's like the boat has washed up onto the beach

45:47.300 --> 45:48.140
and it's flipped over.

45:48.140 --> 45:51.140
Maybe like there's a hermit crab crawling on the beach.

45:51.140 --> 45:55.100
It's just you on a beach, some babes, some ronas

45:55.100 --> 45:57.520
and an old, old rotten boat.

45:57.520 --> 46:02.440
Old, rotten boat full of sailor skeletons.

46:02.440 --> 46:07.440
Since his style is so unique and hard to match,

46:08.760 --> 46:11.960
I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas

46:11.960 --> 46:15.160
on who will take his place when he stops making music.

46:15.160 --> 46:17.360
Probably Stephen Colbert.

46:17.360 --> 46:22.240
Has anyone tried to match his styles?

46:22.240 --> 46:24.440
I'm pretty sure every musician ever just heard that

46:24.440 --> 46:28.920
and was like, ah, I'm not really interested in doing that.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.400
I actually think there's a,

46:30.400 --> 46:33.640
you could make a compelling case for Kenny Chesney.

46:33.640 --> 46:36.960
As a suitable, like where,

46:36.960 --> 46:39.880
if you look at the Kenny Chesney career path,

46:39.880 --> 46:44.880
I think Kenny Chesney could take you down that road.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.280
He's obviously more country inspired

46:48.280 --> 46:49.440
than Jimmy Buffett.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.600
I'm not gonna argue that with you right now.

46:51.600 --> 46:56.520
But what I will say is that he has had a lot of tracks

46:56.520 --> 47:01.520
that are in the milieu, if I may,

47:02.200 --> 47:04.840
of a Jimmy Buffett.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.640
I mean, obviously he's got the novelty hits.

47:06.640 --> 47:07.920
See, he thinks my tracks are sexy.

47:07.920 --> 47:08.880
Sure. Yeah.

47:08.880 --> 47:09.720
Don't mind if I do.

47:09.720 --> 47:10.920
But I mean that, but I mean,

47:10.920 --> 47:15.920
has Jimmy Buffett ever written a non-novelty hit?

47:16.120 --> 47:20.760
Yeah, Jimmy Buffett, he's a storyteller

47:20.760 --> 47:23.360
and his music is transformative.

47:23.360 --> 47:27.240
I'm not gonna let anybody who only knows Margaritaville

47:27.240 --> 47:29.040
sit here and fucking dump on Jimmy Buffett.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.200
Son of a, Son of a Sailor.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.040
Son of a, Son of a Sailor.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.560
Cheeseburger in Paradise. Cheeseburger in Paradise.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.080
Yes, Son of a, Son of a Sailor.

47:34.080 --> 47:37.140
It's not a novelty song, it's a song about growing up.

47:37.140 --> 47:38.920
Jesus.

47:38.920 --> 47:43.920
I'm saying that if Kenny Chesney ever drank a Corona

47:44.360 --> 47:48.360
or a Margarita, he would age super fast and die

47:48.360 --> 47:51.520
like the bad guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

47:51.520 --> 47:54.480
I think if anything slipped between those sweet country lips

47:54.480 --> 47:57.880
other than a Bud Light, if he drank a Bud Light lime,

47:57.880 --> 48:00.040
he would have seizures for two days.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.720
Okay, I'm gonna hit you with,

48:02.720 --> 48:06.840
I'm right now looking at Kenny Chesney's greatest hits too.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.000
Okay?

48:08.000 --> 48:12.080
These are like just some of the tracks on Kenny Chesney

48:12.080 --> 48:14.920
and tell me if you are not getting a Buffett vibe.

48:14.920 --> 48:19.920
Out Last Night, Young, Summertime, Beer in Mexico,

48:20.400 --> 48:25.280
When the Sun Goes Down, No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,

48:25.280 --> 48:28.780
The Good Stuff, I'm a Live Duet with Dave Matthews.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.640
Especially that last one is super on the nose.

48:31.640 --> 48:34.920
Hold on, I have to buy that last one on iTunes real quick

48:34.920 --> 48:36.540
just so I can listen to it and make fun of it.

48:36.540 --> 48:37.380
You know, it's.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.360
Really, excuse me.

48:40.360 --> 48:42.960
Sorry guys, Kenny Chesney is a slightly more

48:42.960 --> 48:46.120
country influenced, slightly younger Jimmy Buffett.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.560
Jimmy Buffett's.

48:47.560 --> 48:51.200
When you have a track called No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,

48:51.200 --> 48:53.280
you're setting yourself up as like the prince.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.800
Is that a Buffett cover?

48:55.760 --> 48:58.040
Buffett actually called him after like,

48:58.040 --> 49:00.040
hold on there buckaroo, hold up.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.320
I gotta check my song list

49:01.320 --> 49:02.400
because that might be one of mine.

49:02.400 --> 49:05.200
I ain't ready to kick yet, I might have already done that one.

49:08.200 --> 49:12.920
I just think about like if I'm kicking it in a hammock

49:12.920 --> 49:14.680
on a beach.

49:14.680 --> 49:15.520
With a boat.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.160
With an old, old rotten skeleton filled boat.

49:19.060 --> 49:22.160
And then I hear like a steel guitar.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.800
It's gonna bring me out of my vibe a little bit.

49:24.800 --> 49:29.800
I'm saying thematically, yes, the ideas espoused

49:30.100 --> 49:34.240
in Kenny Chesney's works are certainly.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.280
The man has a Christmas album

49:36.280 --> 49:40.240
called All I Want for Christmas is a Real Good Tan.

49:40.240 --> 49:42.320
After he published an album with that title,

49:42.320 --> 49:45.080
he had to get a fucking DNA test

49:45.080 --> 49:48.120
to make sure he was not Jimmy Buffett's son.

49:48.120 --> 49:48.960
Legally speaking.

49:48.960 --> 49:53.020
You're saying if Jimmy Buffett committed a heinous murder,

49:53.020 --> 49:56.040
then Kenny Chesney could be convicted of the crime.

49:56.040 --> 49:57.380
Have you guys seen Looper?

50:04.560 --> 50:06.760
I'm just saying, is it possible?

50:06.760 --> 50:08.000
Oh man.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.880
I mean, there's only one solution, right?

50:09.880 --> 50:13.200
We have to cut off Kenny Chesney's hands.

50:13.200 --> 50:18.040
And then we will see if Jimmy Buffett responds.

50:18.040 --> 50:21.760
The man released a CD called Just Who I Am,

50:21.760 --> 50:24.360
Poets and Pirates, okay?

50:25.640 --> 50:26.800
Oh, this is a fun game.

50:26.800 --> 50:27.640
You should set up a game

50:27.640 --> 50:29.200
where you just read like song titles.

50:29.200 --> 50:30.040
Okay, okay.

50:30.040 --> 50:31.240
And then we have to guess if it's Buffett.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.080
This is great.

50:32.080 --> 50:32.900
This is great.

50:32.900 --> 50:33.800
Okay, hold on a second.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.520
All right, so we're back.

50:35.520 --> 50:37.480
Here is the game.

50:37.480 --> 50:42.240
I am going to tell you titles of songs.

50:42.240 --> 50:45.680
You're going to tell me if it is a Jimmy Buffett song

50:45.680 --> 50:47.120
or Kenny Chesney song.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.080
Are you ready?

50:48.080 --> 50:50.440
Yes, I am ready.

50:50.440 --> 50:51.980
Can I use the internet?

50:52.920 --> 50:53.740
What?

50:53.740 --> 50:54.580
No, you cannot.

50:54.580 --> 50:55.400
What are you talking about?

50:55.400 --> 50:57.000
No, here we go.

50:59.600 --> 51:02.040
Grapefruit, juicy fruit.

51:02.040 --> 51:04.280
Definitely, definitely Jimmy Buffett.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.840
Chesney.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.640
It is Jimmy Buffett.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.160
Ah.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.960
Guitars and tiki bars.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.640
Definitely, 100% Jimmy Buffett.

51:14.640 --> 51:15.640
Buffett.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.360
Sorry, that's Kenneth Chesney.

51:17.360 --> 51:20.040
Ah, Kenneth, Kenneth.

51:21.520 --> 51:22.880
You fucked me, Kenneth.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.360
Here we go again.

51:24.360 --> 51:26.760
Sherry's Livin' in Paradise.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.280
If it has paradise in it,

51:28.280 --> 51:30.280
fucking Jimmy Buffett owns a trademark.

51:30.280 --> 51:32.640
No, it's Chesney and I bet it's actually

51:32.640 --> 51:34.000
about someone being dead.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.200
Ah, that's Kenny Chesney.

51:36.200 --> 51:37.160
God damn it.

51:37.160 --> 51:38.600
Here we go another one.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.480
I'll guess Chesney on the next one.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.400
Okay, this is an easy one.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.400
Okay.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.800
Changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes.

51:45.800 --> 51:47.860
Definitely Jimmy Buffett.

51:47.860 --> 51:48.700
Buffett.

51:48.700 --> 51:49.520
Correct, that's Buffett.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.360
That's a good one.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.520
I twisted it on you because you thought

51:51.520 --> 51:52.440
you were going to trick me

51:52.440 --> 51:54.920
because I said I was going to guess Chesney.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.620
Pencil thin mustache.

51:56.620 --> 51:57.460
Chesney?

51:58.700 --> 51:59.540
Buffett.

51:59.540 --> 52:00.800
No, that's Jimmy Buffett.

52:00.800 --> 52:02.180
Fuck me, damn it.

52:02.180 --> 52:03.720
I thought, there's no way Jimmy Buffett

52:03.720 --> 52:06.800
would sing about such wispy facial hair.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.160
Brown eyed girl.

52:11.160 --> 52:12.360
Jimmy Buffett.

52:13.660 --> 52:16.500
And no Van Morrison, but good try.

52:18.840 --> 52:20.480
Okay, just a couple more

52:20.480 --> 52:22.620
because this is a slam dunk game.

52:24.360 --> 52:26.060
Last mango in Paris.

52:28.040 --> 52:28.880
Chesney?

52:28.880 --> 52:29.700
See, I'm going to say Chesney

52:29.700 --> 52:32.200
because that sounds so much like a Jimmy Buffett song.

52:32.200 --> 52:35.100
That is actually James Buffett.

52:37.800 --> 52:39.600
That fucking dick.

52:39.600 --> 52:43.240
He all he has to say is the name of a food and a place.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.440
And it's a song.

52:44.440 --> 52:49.080
He's like the Elvis Costello of putting food in places.

52:49.080 --> 52:50.600
Okay, I'm going to hit,

52:50.600 --> 52:51.880
we're going to go to the lightning round.

52:51.880 --> 52:52.720
You ready?

52:52.720 --> 52:53.540
Yes.

52:53.540 --> 52:54.380
Ready for the lightning round.

52:54.380 --> 52:55.220
How has this not been the lightning round

52:55.220 --> 52:56.040
the whole time though?

52:56.040 --> 52:56.920
This is the lightning round.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.560
Are you ready?

52:58.560 --> 52:59.400
Lightning round.

52:59.400 --> 53:00.640
And here's the thing about the lightning round.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.200
You guys have to agree.

53:02.200 --> 53:03.400
You can't just each pick a different one.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.240
You have to agree on it.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.060
Here we go.

53:05.060 --> 53:06.800
So the lightning round will be categorically slower.

53:06.800 --> 53:07.640
Slower.

53:07.640 --> 53:08.460
Slower.

53:08.460 --> 53:09.300
Here we go.

53:09.300 --> 53:10.140
Here we go.

53:10.140 --> 53:11.840
Life is good.

53:11.840 --> 53:12.680
Buffett?

53:12.680 --> 53:13.500
I'm going Chesney.

53:13.500 --> 53:14.340
Oh, fuck me.

53:14.340 --> 53:15.180
God damn it, Travis.

53:15.180 --> 53:16.000
When are we going to get together on anything?

53:16.000 --> 53:16.840
Come with me.

53:16.840 --> 53:17.680
Come with me on this, Griffin.

53:17.680 --> 53:19.680
I'll go with Travis on the Chesney Express.

53:19.680 --> 53:20.520
Kenny Chesney.

53:20.520 --> 53:21.360
Yeah.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.180
Yes.

53:22.180 --> 53:23.020
Big call, Travis.

53:23.020 --> 53:23.920
Soul of a sailor.

53:23.920 --> 53:26.720
Ooh, see, that sounds so, but wait.

53:26.720 --> 53:27.820
Buffett, okay.

53:27.820 --> 53:29.400
Buffett sucks ass, right?

53:29.400 --> 53:30.240
We can agree on that.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.060
Buffett's terrible.

53:31.060 --> 53:32.140
He's not a good musician.

53:32.140 --> 53:33.460
I don't think he's so bad though

53:33.460 --> 53:34.540
that he would release a song called

53:34.540 --> 53:35.560
Son of a son of a sailor.

53:35.560 --> 53:38.760
And then also, unless it's the fucking sequel.

53:38.760 --> 53:40.800
Here's the sequel to my last joint hit.

53:41.760 --> 53:42.600
Also about to-

53:42.600 --> 53:43.740
Right, you guys are wrong.

53:43.740 --> 53:45.560
But anyway, go ahead.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.240
Go ahead with your wrongness.

53:47.240 --> 53:48.680
Stick with Buffett.

53:48.680 --> 53:49.700
Buffett.

53:49.700 --> 53:50.600
It's Kenny Chesney.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.460
God damn you, Justin.

53:53.520 --> 53:54.980
You can't, Alec Trebek isn't like,

53:54.980 --> 53:56.980
are you sure about that answer, pussy?

53:58.000 --> 53:59.660
You sure you want to go with that one, pussy?

53:59.660 --> 54:01.000
Okay, stupid.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.980
And then they change and he's like, I just got you.

54:02.980 --> 54:04.860
Turn out the light and love me tonight.

54:04.860 --> 54:06.060
Kenny Chesney.

54:06.060 --> 54:07.980
That's gotta be Chesney.

54:07.980 --> 54:09.440
That's Kenny Chesney.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.060
Yes.

54:11.060 --> 54:12.280
Boat drinks.

54:12.280 --> 54:16.580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, one more time.

54:16.580 --> 54:17.620
Not a tune.

54:17.620 --> 54:18.600
Boat drinks.

54:18.600 --> 54:19.440
Not a track.

54:19.440 --> 54:20.280
Boat sipping.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.940
I'm gonna go trick question.

54:23.840 --> 54:27.860
All right, this is the point at which Griffin edits in

54:27.860 --> 54:29.440
a little bit of boat drinks.

54:29.440 --> 54:30.440
Boat drinks.

54:31.760 --> 54:34.840
Boys in the van ordered boat drinks.

54:34.840 --> 54:36.480
By James Buffett.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.960
No.

54:39.960 --> 54:41.240
From the album Volcano.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.480
Sunshine Coconut Women.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.280
All right, that was the.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.260
Sandy butts.

54:46.260 --> 54:47.680
Beach Ball Corona Hour.

54:49.760 --> 54:52.040
I just really, what I'm pointing out is.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.160
Poultry swaying, beach babes playing.

54:54.160 --> 54:57.860
Pointing out is that James Buffett is the shittiest.

54:57.860 --> 55:01.280
Boat drinks.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.800
That's gonna do it for us here on my brother,

55:02.800 --> 55:04.440
my brother and me.

55:04.440 --> 55:05.640
Advice show for the modern era.

55:05.640 --> 55:09.600
We hope you've had as much fun as we have here.

55:10.920 --> 55:14.200
Thank you to Squarespace and Harry's.com

55:14.200 --> 55:16.000
for their stewardship.

55:16.880 --> 55:19.460
And make sure to go check out BoatParty.biz.

55:19.460 --> 55:22.040
Yeah, BoatParty.biz, go get your tickets to that.

55:23.160 --> 55:25.480
Big thanks to everybody who bought tickets

55:25.480 --> 55:29.040
to the other show that we had that went up.

55:29.040 --> 55:32.420
I know not everyone still got tickets to go.

55:32.420 --> 55:37.180
I really hope that people like honored our request

55:37.180 --> 55:38.480
not to buy tickets if you already had tickets

55:38.480 --> 55:39.380
to the other one.

55:39.380 --> 55:41.060
Because like to me, it was fucking crazy

55:41.060 --> 55:42.360
how fast they sold out.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.560
If we see you at all three shows, we will humiliate you.

55:46.560 --> 55:47.760
We'll embarrass you.

55:47.760 --> 55:50.040
We'll memorize the faces at each show.

55:50.040 --> 55:52.120
And we will humiliate you in front of everyone.

55:52.120 --> 55:53.680
And then we will have you escorted.

55:53.680 --> 55:54.880
No, we won't do that.

55:54.880 --> 55:58.320
That's gonna be a very fun, very long day for us.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.280
I guess apologies to the people who bought tickets

56:00.280 --> 56:01.780
to the last show.

56:01.780 --> 56:04.260
Because you're gonna be getting the snickle fritz

56:04.260 --> 56:05.100
at that point.

56:05.100 --> 56:06.560
No, that's gonna be the one where we're drunk.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.280
Yeah, that's gonna be the punch drunk,

56:08.280 --> 56:10.000
you know, spaghetti-getting stuff.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.600
Don't promise people spaghetti-getting

56:11.600 --> 56:12.720
if we can't deliver spaghetti-getting.

56:12.720 --> 56:13.680
Spaghetti-getting too.

56:13.680 --> 56:16.120
Somebody get a spaghetti between the four o'clock show

56:16.120 --> 56:16.960
and the nine o'clock show.

56:16.960 --> 56:17.800
That's what we're gonna feed you.

56:17.800 --> 56:20.240
Get in your pockets, you dirty birds.

56:20.240 --> 56:24.320
If everyone, if all 150 people bring a pocket full

56:24.320 --> 56:28.440
of spaghetti, we could probably eat a whole table full.

56:28.440 --> 56:31.400
And listen, if you come up to me thinking you're cute

56:31.400 --> 56:33.720
and try to hand me spaghetti from your pocket,

56:33.720 --> 56:35.280
I will fucking rabbit punch you.

56:35.280 --> 56:38.940
And you will black out and spend our show

56:38.940 --> 56:41.140
that you paid good money for in a coma.

56:41.140 --> 56:43.880
That's my promise to you, the listener.

56:44.880 --> 56:45.720
Don't do that.

56:45.720 --> 56:46.920
But sorry if you didn't get in.

56:46.920 --> 56:48.840
We'll do more shows up there.

56:48.840 --> 56:52.780
Listen, we fucking, we slept on live shows for a while.

56:52.780 --> 56:56.440
I guess we were kind of busy.

56:56.440 --> 56:59.180
But I feel like we don't play the

56:59.180 --> 57:01.260
we're just three guys card very often.

57:01.260 --> 57:04.320
But we don't know fuck all about planning live events.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.160
So like.

57:05.160 --> 57:05.980
But we're trying to get on it.

57:05.980 --> 57:07.580
You need to understand that when we do shit like this,

57:07.580 --> 57:10.420
it is a crazy, crazy thing of us getting

57:10.420 --> 57:13.400
like super, super outside of our comfort zone.

57:13.400 --> 57:16.460
So like it's a big undertaking for us

57:16.460 --> 57:18.520
to even do like a couple of these things a year.

57:18.520 --> 57:19.540
But we're trying to do more of them

57:19.540 --> 57:20.940
because we know we fucked up

57:20.940 --> 57:24.020
and didn't get out to see you guys.

57:24.020 --> 57:25.960
So we're gonna do more of it.

57:27.160 --> 57:30.420
Also, if you know somebody who wants to be our manager,

57:30.420 --> 57:32.300
who's like professional at it.

57:32.300 --> 57:33.780
And who will do it for free.

57:33.780 --> 57:34.620
He'll do it for free.

57:34.620 --> 57:35.820
You guys are like, I'm not kidding.

57:35.820 --> 57:38.900
I would, I mean, if we could take time off work

57:38.900 --> 57:40.500
and like, if we had a tour manager,

57:40.500 --> 57:44.060
like I would do, I would do a week or two with you dudes.

57:44.060 --> 57:46.780
Why are we having like a meeting about this right now?

57:46.780 --> 57:47.620
I'm just nervous.

57:47.620 --> 57:48.860
Hey, everybody turn off the podcast for a minute.

57:48.860 --> 57:49.700
Turn off the podcast for a minute.

57:49.700 --> 57:50.520
So fellas.

57:50.520 --> 57:53.140
We could do like a straight down the East coast,

57:53.140 --> 57:57.340
start in Boston, go down, end in Vero Beach, Florida.

57:57.340 --> 57:58.180
Mexico.

57:58.180 --> 57:59.020
Oh, sorry.

57:59.020 --> 57:59.840
Vero Beach?

57:59.840 --> 58:00.680
Yes.

58:00.680 --> 58:02.940
We have a lot of listeners in Vero Beach, Florida.

58:02.940 --> 58:04.580
I have a boat that washed up there.

58:04.580 --> 58:05.980
I've been meaning to get back to it.

58:05.980 --> 58:07.260
It's full of old skeletons.

58:07.260 --> 58:10.100
It's full of skeletons and weird crabs.

58:11.780 --> 58:13.140
Yeah, so.

58:13.140 --> 58:16.180
Listen, oh, if you have questions for the live show,

58:16.180 --> 58:17.700
if you're gonna be there, start sending them in now.

58:17.700 --> 58:19.540
Because we'll need a fuckload of them.

58:19.540 --> 58:22.300
Yeah, because we've got to do three fucking shows that day.

58:22.300 --> 58:23.940
Just make sure that like, if you're gonna be

58:23.940 --> 58:26.340
at the 1.30 show or the four o'clock show

58:26.340 --> 58:28.900
or the 9.30 show that you put that in the subject line.

58:28.900 --> 58:31.100
So we can do it when you're actually there.

58:32.180 --> 58:37.180
And if you want to be nice and offer your,

58:37.220 --> 58:39.160
if you got tickets to more than one show

58:39.160 --> 58:41.060
and you want to offer them out to people who didn't,

58:41.060 --> 58:41.940
that would be great.

58:41.940 --> 58:43.580
Sell them for 300%.

58:43.580 --> 58:45.420
At a premium price.

58:45.420 --> 58:46.900
Mark up value there.

58:46.900 --> 58:50.140
I'm saying like $7,500 you could probably get.

58:50.140 --> 58:52.980
And there also is gonna be like standby at the theater.

58:52.980 --> 58:54.420
I think if you go by before the shows.

58:54.420 --> 58:57.620
I would be very, very, very careful to like,

58:57.620 --> 58:59.660
I don't think it's gonna be a substantial amount.

58:59.660 --> 59:02.740
And like, there were a lot of people who didn't get tickets.

59:02.740 --> 59:05.220
So like, definitely if you want to try for it, go for it.

59:05.220 --> 59:08.460
But it is not a lock by any stretch of the imagination.

59:08.460 --> 59:11.500
We promise that we are gonna come back very soon.

59:11.500 --> 59:14.300
We underestimated the number of people

59:14.300 --> 59:15.260
who would want to see us.

59:15.260 --> 59:16.500
And that's a good problem to have,

59:16.500 --> 59:19.260
but it's, that doesn't, you know,

59:19.260 --> 59:20.940
it doesn't make it better for you.

59:20.940 --> 59:23.580
So we promise we will come back very soon.

59:23.580 --> 59:25.860
Now that we know how many of you want to see us

59:25.860 --> 59:28.580
and also maybe we'll have somebody

59:28.580 --> 59:29.660
who can actually like help us

59:29.660 --> 59:31.860
and knows anything at all about anything.

59:33.580 --> 59:34.500
I'm gonna think we already did it,

59:34.500 --> 59:35.820
but John Roderick and the Long Winters

59:35.820 --> 59:37.660
for the use of our theme song into departure,

59:37.660 --> 59:40.340
which is only up and putting the days to bed.

59:40.340 --> 59:42.580
Seriously guys, get that, get that album.

59:43.420 --> 59:45.000

No, every day.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.820
We've got 6,000 shows on the Maximum Fun Network right now.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:24.380
Go listen to Song Exploder's new Jimmy Buffett episode

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.020
in which Buffett like breaks down all of the complex layering

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.420
that he did on his song, Beach Ball Fantasies.

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.820
Son of a, Spirit of a Beach Ball Fantasies, the sequel.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.820
And that's gonna do it for us here.

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.300
Beach Ball's bouncing.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.940
Sand Crab's pouncing.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:43.780
Go ahead.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.940
Griffin, Griffin's pouncing.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.780
Do you have a last question?

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.060
This is the shittiest beach ever.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.300
Just kidding, every beach is great.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.200
I'm Jimmy Buffett.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.120
Have a pineapple.

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.540
Eat this pineapple off my body.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.740
Eat this pineapple off my body.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.500
Okay, Griffin, last question.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.740
That has to exist, right?

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.260
It's the last, probably yes.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.860
This Yasu, this Yasu.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:07.700
This Yahoo.

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.340
This Yasu Aerofet.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.980
This Yadis Yahoo.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.660
This Yahoo Night's Mystery was sent in by Alan Black.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:15.500
Thank you, Alan.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Cassandra, who asks,

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.140
what if an alien weapon caused you

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.440
to switch bladders with Taylor Swift?

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.280
What?

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.020
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.060
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.340
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.180
It's been my brother, my brother.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.300
May you kiss your dad.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.360
Squirrel lips.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:02:03.340
I am so proud to be an American and to be hosting Throwing Chains.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:07.980
I am proud to have really deep brown eyes.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.180
Well, this is actually supposed to be,

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.740
you know this is supposed to be a thing

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.580
so that people listen to our show.

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.340
Oh, so I've just been so busy this week.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.180
Oh, okay.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.020
But I'm very happy to be here.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.460
The podcast is called?

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.420
It's called Throwing Shade.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.260
You're the co-host, yeah.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:21.700
So, Throwing Shade, we talk about.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.900
You're the gay co-host, I'm the female co-host.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:24.740
I always forget.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.580
We're friends in real life, kind of.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.020
And we talk about lady and gay issues.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:29.860
Yeah.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.780
And we talk about them in a way

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.180
that is really disrespectful.

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.620
Yeah, if you love the world and hate yourself.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.020
Please listen to Throwing Shade.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:03:04.020
Yeah.
