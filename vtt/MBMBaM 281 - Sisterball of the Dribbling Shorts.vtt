00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.680
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.200 --> 00:58.000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And guys, Griffin, I'm changing.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
What?

01:00.000 --> 01:06.320
I feel a spirit of renewal in my heart of hearts that has got me excited.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.040
Today's the first day of the rest of my life.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.600
Is this like a holiday? Like, Ebenezer Scrooge, they did it all in one night?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.760
Yes, it's kind of like that. Yes, it's kind of like that.

01:15.760 --> 01:21.520
Except if instead of three ghosts spooking me good, spooking my bones.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.440
Spooking you into good, spooking, turning you good.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.720
Just spooking me, just raw dogging me with their spooky spirits.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.760
Instead of that happening to me in the night time, during the daytime yesterday,

01:34.640 --> 01:39.440
I became the world's number one basketball boy.

01:39.440 --> 01:39.760
What?

01:39.760 --> 01:40.000
What?

01:40.880 --> 01:45.920
I went to a college basketball game in which college age athletes play basketball.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.520
They do basketball against each other.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.880
You mean big kids?

01:50.880 --> 01:54.240
Yeah, like big, big kids. And like, I didn't know I had it in me

01:54.240 --> 01:57.920
to love this new thing, or any new thing for that matter.

01:57.920 --> 02:02.080
But specifically this new thing, I always thought basketball was the final frontier.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.600
And there I was standing there, hooping and hollering.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.040
And you enjoyed it.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.560
Oh, I loved every second of it.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.480
I yelled with every dunk, with every achieved-

02:12.480 --> 02:13.120
Funk?

02:13.120 --> 02:15.440
With every funk and every achieved rebound.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.400
How about every clunk? That's what they miss.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.520
Well, I wasn't cheering for the clunks. No, Travis, I-

02:21.520 --> 02:22.560
That was a test.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.840
It was a test.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.480
I was. Every time they missed a shot, I would yell at a referee.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.640
Listen, I didn't know what I was doing out there.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.520
You were yelling at a college referee, Griffin? That seems mean.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.240
Aren't they just like philosophy professors?

02:35.040 --> 02:38.720
Yes, they are double duty school nurses.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.600
But anyway, I am the ultimate hoops fan in the world.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.120
I don't know anything about it.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.800
I don't know anything about the sport, really.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.880
Like they kept getting double bonuses and I wasn't sure what that was exactly.

02:50.880 --> 02:51.600
Sure.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.920
But you don't need to know the most about it.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.160
You just have to have the most passion in your heart for it.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.760
And I'm just saying like right now that I'm a bigger basketball fan

02:59.760 --> 03:02.080
than basically anybody listening to this podcast.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.760
Would you say that you have March Madness?

03:04.400 --> 03:08.880
I definitely have. I got December diarrhea is what I have.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.600
Did you-

03:09.600 --> 03:10.960
December dementia.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.120
Yes.

03:11.120 --> 03:16.080
As far as you could tell, Griffin, did anybody fake the funk on a nasty dunk?

03:16.080 --> 03:16.960
Oh, good question.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.000
There was only one dunk in the whole game.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.360
Okay.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.560
But there was a lot of fundamentals and they did not fake the funk on their funk-dementals.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.920
Now, Griffin, let me ask you this.

03:27.920 --> 03:28.560
Yes, ask me.

03:28.560 --> 03:28.880
Was there a player-

03:28.880 --> 03:29.200
Please, please.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.440
I want the two of you to just keep asking me questions in order.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.240
Travis, it's your turn.

03:32.240 --> 03:37.040
Was there a player who made two shots in a row and then the announcer yelled,

03:37.040 --> 03:38.000
he's on fire?

03:38.000 --> 03:38.480
Oh, sorry.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.280
He's heating up.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.440
Let me tell you this.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.080
Whenever your team scores two buckets and drains two tasty buckets in a row,

03:46.080 --> 03:47.920
two 10 piece wing buckets in a row,

03:47.920 --> 03:50.560
then everybody in the crowd would stand up and start cheering.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.720
And part of me wondered like, oh, shit, here come that infinite turbo meter.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.280
Here come them fiery nets.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.760
But I don't think that they managed to do that in real life, no.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.680
And then Bill Clinton came out and he was an unlockable character and he played.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.400
And he played.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.000
I was wearing my basketball shorts because I wasn't sure what's customary to wear to a game.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.440
Well, like you take a mitt to a baseball game in case you want to catch a fly ball.

04:15.440 --> 04:15.680
Right.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.080
I thought in case they threw a basketball in the crowd and then I caught it.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.760
And then like, technically, that's a live ball.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.080
So I'm like, what am I, center now, point guard?

04:23.120 --> 04:26.400
See, I guess I do know a little bit about the beautiful sport.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.080
You're a leftist.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.040
I think that's one, when you stand on the left side and you guard.

04:31.040 --> 04:31.600
Uh-huh.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.440
Griffin, would you like people to directly email you some of their favorite teams

04:35.440 --> 04:36.880
and different moves in basketball?

04:37.680 --> 04:38.160
I'd rather not.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.840
Or to make you like some of their favorite players or different favorite basketball moves?

04:41.840 --> 04:43.440
I don't really want to money the water right now.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.080
With knowledge, you don't need facts.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.240
No, it would be, facts are fine.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.960
I'm not looking, I don't want to know about opinions.

04:50.960 --> 04:54.000
I don't want to know any opinions on the names of what players are.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.720
I just, I want to, I want my joy to be sort of, I want it to go unperturbed.

05:00.720 --> 05:06.880
And I want to just explore this new facet of myself, which is why starting next year,

05:06.880 --> 05:08.880
I am leaving the podcast.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.800
Oh, okay.

05:10.800 --> 05:18.400
To explore my basketball fantasies in a new podcast I'm launching called Basketball Fantasies.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.200
It's going to be so confusing because people are going to go to it for fancy basketball tips.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.840
It's going to be me like, what if you could score a three-point dunk?

05:27.840 --> 05:30.000
Now listen, here's how it works.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.040
I just picture Griffin out in like Joshua Tree, just like staring at a basketball,

05:35.040 --> 05:39.440
sitting on a bluff and just like thinking about like, what is dunking?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.960
Like, what does it mean?

05:40.960 --> 05:42.320
What does it mean to dunk?

05:42.320 --> 05:45.440
Because it doesn't have to, I feel like it's different things to different people.

05:46.400 --> 05:50.880
For me, when I'm confronted by a friend that I've wronged and I tell the truth,

05:50.880 --> 05:52.480
that's a sick dunk right there.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.360
When a referee like really calls a foul that no one else saw, did the referee just like dunk?

05:57.360 --> 05:59.440
Yeah, you did get dunked on by the ref.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.720
I, people get very excited about dunks, but really,

06:02.720 --> 06:04.800
aren't you just carrying the basketball to the hoop?

06:05.520 --> 06:07.200
Wouldn't it be harder to throw it?

06:07.200 --> 06:07.440
Yeah.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.000
I agree.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.640
Thanks.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.440
Good point, Justin.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.600
And I'm sorry, but I don't think you should be like, if they lift you up,

06:13.600 --> 06:16.400
if your team players put you on your shoulders and then you dunk,

06:16.400 --> 06:17.520
I don't think that should count.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.800
That shouldn't be allowed now.

06:18.800 --> 06:24.320
Do you think maybe in 2016, we could do all themed episodes like every week,

06:24.320 --> 06:26.640
do a different theme just to like mix it up a little bit?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.640
Because I would, I'll be honest with you guys right now,

06:29.200 --> 06:34.320
I would do anything, I would pay any price to keep talking about basketball for the next 54 minutes.

06:34.320 --> 06:34.800
Yeah.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.920
That's how, this is such an interesting, I believe it's 180, where-

06:39.920 --> 06:40.880
I'm learning so much.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.000
Yeah, where it gets to a point where if I'm not mistaken, like two years ago,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.760
I think you hated sports.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.560
Yeah, I'm learning so much from myself, which is the weird thing.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.120
You know what I mean?

06:50.000 --> 06:50.960
We've all grown.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.440
This is like Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 3,

06:53.440 --> 06:55.840
where they just go to basketball games for the whole movie.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.080
Yeah.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.240
Sisterhood of the Traveling Huge Basketball Shorts.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.440
Well, Sister Ball, Sister Ball, Sister Ball-

07:01.440 --> 07:02.960
Sister Ball 3.

07:02.960 --> 07:10.960
Sorry, Emilio S. M. S. as a no-nonsense, disgraced lawyer with a team of sisters.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.480
Sister Ball of the Dribbling Shorts.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.840
You gotta share the ball.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.160
What?

07:16.160 --> 07:17.040
You can share the ball?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.000
That's crazy.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.120
You can't travel.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.200
I did pick up on that during the game.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.160
You cannot travel.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.080
You have to dribble and you have to be wearing shorts

07:24.080 --> 07:26.560
and you have to be in possession of the sister ball,

07:26.560 --> 07:27.840
because that's the only way you can score.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.120
You can't score without the sister ball.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.040
What is the legal wait time before eating neglected household foods?

07:33.040 --> 07:35.760
For example, if my significant other purchases cookies

07:35.760 --> 07:37.680
and neglects to eat them for two weeks,

07:37.680 --> 07:40.640
am I within my rights to go to town on those cookies?

07:40.640 --> 07:42.240
I stole the cookies from the cookie jar,

07:42.240 --> 07:43.680
is the name of the person who asked the question,

07:43.680 --> 07:46.000
but also something that they're admitting.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.360
Okay, hold on.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.000
Okay, hold on.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.120
Your significant other bought it, right?

07:53.760 --> 07:57.040
And then they sat untouched for two weeks?

07:57.040 --> 07:58.720
Two weeks?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.560
It would seem that way, yes.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.280
Was the significant other waiting for a special cookie?

08:05.120 --> 08:06.640
Yeah, you can have a cookie.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.160
Are they Thanksgiving cookies?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.520
Do they maybe have a turkey on them?

08:09.520 --> 08:10.800
Oh, this is a good question,

08:10.800 --> 08:12.560
because there's different forms of cookie.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.960
Was this just like your chewy chocolate chip cookie?

08:16.960 --> 08:17.680
Or was this like,

08:17.680 --> 08:21.200
I bought a 10 of those Danish cookies for that Christmas party

08:21.200 --> 08:23.520
we're going to have in, I guess, three weeks,

08:23.520 --> 08:25.920
but they were cheaper now because it's November 2nd.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.240
And like, what?

08:28.240 --> 08:28.960
This is madness.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.760
This is, none of this,

08:29.760 --> 08:32.560
I put my cookies in a fucking safety deposit box in a bank.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.680
What are you talking about?

08:33.680 --> 08:34.400
No, this is-

08:35.520 --> 08:36.880
Super quick flash poll.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.440
Can I get a thumbs up or thumbs down on dance butter cookies?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.800
Oh, big thumbs up.

08:40.800 --> 08:41.440
Thumbs up, right?

08:41.440 --> 08:42.720
They're delicious and grumbly.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.920
With a cream or a liquid that you can have them with.

08:45.920 --> 08:46.560
Oh, definitely.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.480
They're a great nog partner.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.800
Yes, they are a good friend to the eggnog.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.360
But-

08:51.360 --> 08:53.360
Because also you're left with a 10 afterwards,

08:53.360 --> 08:54.720
and who doesn't love a 10?

08:54.720 --> 08:56.480
Yeah, you can put anything in that, marbles.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.760
Listen, we need to aim any advice we give on this question

08:59.760 --> 09:01.760
to any other person than this person.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.360
Because this person isn't looking for advice,

09:03.360 --> 09:07.440
they are looking for either forgiveness or acceptance.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.320
And I'm not willing to give you that because you did not wait.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.400
The fact that you did not wait means that

09:12.400 --> 09:14.160
it's not that important to you what we think,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.200
you bad, bad cookie boy.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.360
But most of the time, you just ask them.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.760
Why can't you just ask them, can I eat some cookies?

09:23.760 --> 09:27.360
Yeah, why do you need us to give you cooklematic permission?

09:27.360 --> 09:30.880
I'm sorry, but like, if you're in a relationship

09:30.880 --> 09:32.800
in which like you share love,

09:32.800 --> 09:35.200
you're allowed to have a goddamn cookie.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.080
Like, I don't know what relationship that would be

09:38.080 --> 09:40.960
where you would describe someone as your significant other,

09:40.960 --> 09:43.600
but not when it came to cookie sharing,

09:43.600 --> 09:46.800
unless they know you as the type of person who sits down

09:46.800 --> 09:50.960
to like watch, you know, seven hours of Parks and Rec

09:50.960 --> 09:53.920
and eat an entire sleeve of cookies in one go.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.800
That could be what happened.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.360
And that's not how love works, Travis,

09:57.360 --> 10:00.160
to say like, love means never having to say,

10:00.160 --> 10:00.880
can I have this?

10:04.320 --> 10:05.600
What you've just said is madness.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.320
Cause if you buy yourself a hoagie and you turn around

10:08.320 --> 10:10.240
and Teresa has eaten the entire hoagie

10:10.240 --> 10:11.840
and she can't just shrug her shoulders

10:11.840 --> 10:12.320
and be like, marriage.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.360
Because she's warm a dick.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.160
Because she thinks she's feeble.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.120
But the problem is, girl,

10:17.120 --> 10:20.480
when you're talking about a one-off food experience,

10:20.480 --> 10:21.440
cookies, that's like,

10:21.440 --> 10:24.960
if you sit down and eat an entire family size bag of Cheetos,

10:24.960 --> 10:26.160
A, I'm worried about you,

10:26.160 --> 10:28.640
but B, like clearly that was a shared experience.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.360
But if I go to the store and I get a single bag of Cheetos

10:31.360 --> 10:33.440
and you eat all of them, yeah, you're terrible.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.760
So then you bought a Quiznos party platter

10:35.760 --> 10:36.800
and you're planning on having,

10:36.800 --> 10:39.440
I know you, six to seven of those little sumbitches.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.960
That's why you get small ones.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.200
Yeah, but unfortunately, uh-oh,

10:43.200 --> 10:45.760
when you weren't looking, Teresa Duke snarfed them.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.040
Whoops.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.800
Now, and you're just cool with that?

10:48.800 --> 10:50.640
Because it's like, well, marriage, love, it means sharing.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.480
I will say that in this specific example,

10:52.480 --> 10:54.160
I'm very cool with it because for once,

10:54.160 --> 10:56.560
I'm not the food monster in our house.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.680
So yeah, I think I'd be like,

10:57.680 --> 10:59.040
thank you for taking some of the heat off of me.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.240
She learned it from watching you.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.600
She learned it from watching you, though.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.840
I think the worst food monster stunt I ever did

11:03.840 --> 11:06.800
was when I was a young boy, perhaps 12 years old,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.720
and I was reading in my parents' closet,

11:08.720 --> 11:10.320
looking for God knows what.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.080
What do you look for in your parents' closets

11:12.080 --> 11:13.040
when you're a kid?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.480
Forgiveness something.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.760
And what did I find there?

11:15.760 --> 11:20.880
But a couple of delicious bubblegum cigars.

11:21.600 --> 11:26.000
It's a boy, and I found one, and I ate it all up.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.080
What was the significance of that?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.000
Well, it was purchased upon my birth.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.120
It was purchased when I was born.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.600
So it was not only a food monster, but old and gross.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.160
Yeah, it's like, I just ate the special bubblegum cigar

11:42.160 --> 11:43.120
for my birth.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.680
That they were saving for your wedding?

11:45.680 --> 11:47.280
Well, this is a good question, Travis,

11:47.280 --> 11:48.960
that I have posed to Dad over the years.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.400
What were you saving that for?

11:50.400 --> 11:53.040
I'm glad somebody got to enjoy it, you know?

11:53.040 --> 11:53.840
But you ate it.

11:53.840 --> 11:54.800
You did not chew it.

11:54.800 --> 11:55.360
You ate it.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.400
You consumed it.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.840
Well, I mean, I swallowed bubblegum.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.640
I'm not an animal.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.240
I live evil can evil one hand at a time.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.400
So yeah, I ate the bubblegum,

12:04.400 --> 12:07.040
the special, special bubblegum cigar

12:07.040 --> 12:08.800
that bots celebrate and commemorate.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.720
Could you taste like sort of the warm memories

12:12.720 --> 12:14.320
that you were depriving our-

12:15.200 --> 12:17.040
It tastes like the Reagan administration.

12:17.040 --> 12:17.920
Is that what you're asking?

12:17.920 --> 12:18.640
Yes.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.480
And how old were you when this bubblegum

12:20.480 --> 12:21.760
was consumed like food?

12:21.760 --> 12:23.360
12, 12, 12, 12.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.560
Oh no, way too old.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.600
Damn, son.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.640
12 years.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.200
This is not-

12:27.200 --> 12:31.200
12 is too old to go on bubblegum adventures.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.840
This was old enough that if it had been at Griffin's birth,

12:33.840 --> 12:34.880
it would have been gross.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.880
Yeah, but here's the other thing about it.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.000
It tasted fine.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.800
To my memory, it tasted fine.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.240
There's not a lot of like love lost, flavor lost

12:44.240 --> 12:45.920
when it comes to bubblegum.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.160
It's not like, oh, I found an eight-year-old thing

12:48.160 --> 12:50.160
of Bazooka Joe, it's spoiled.

12:50.160 --> 12:50.660
Yeah.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.080
You just microwave it for two seconds and it's perfect.

12:54.080 --> 12:54.800
Uh, yeah.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.400
I had another answer about bubblegum,

12:58.400 --> 12:59.600
but I think we should move on.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.640
No, I do want to hear it.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.240
Is it as bad as the last one you told?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.520
Because if so, I need it, I think.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.760
He found a cigar that says,

13:05.760 --> 13:08.480
congratulations on signing the Declaration of Independence.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.280
Yeah.

13:09.280 --> 13:13.600
And I broke into the Smithsonian so I could eat it.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.880
National Treasure III.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.560
Justin took the Declaration of Independence

13:16.560 --> 13:18.880
and the Constitution and he spread a fine layer

13:18.880 --> 13:21.040
of queso cheese in between the two of them

13:21.040 --> 13:22.560
and threw it in the microwave for a minute and a half

13:22.560 --> 13:25.200
and then ate it with a salsa on top.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.960
And then Kate said, no.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.320
It was freedom nachos.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.280
I mean, it was special.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.640
Do you guys want a yahoo?

13:32.640 --> 13:33.520
Yeah, please.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.960
Wait, no, your bubblegum story.

13:34.960 --> 13:35.920
Is it really good?

13:35.920 --> 13:37.520
It wasn't about a bubblegum story,

13:37.520 --> 13:40.160
it was about a bubblegum book I read when I was a kid

13:40.160 --> 13:42.640
about a kid who bought baseball cards

13:42.640 --> 13:43.680
but hated the bubblegum,

13:43.680 --> 13:46.800
the old chewy crumbling pubens nasty gum that came with them.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.960
And so he left them all like in a big lump

13:48.960 --> 13:51.040
in a big pile that it turned into a monster.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.320
And that story made me want gum so bad

13:54.320 --> 13:55.440
and I didn't have any.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.360
This was in 86.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.360
For me, it was the episode of Wild and Crazy Kids

13:59.360 --> 14:01.040
where they had an episode contest

14:01.040 --> 14:04.720
where they had to chew that like big,

14:04.720 --> 14:06.960
what are those big bubblegums called?

14:06.960 --> 14:09.440
I think it might have been like flavored double bubble,

14:09.440 --> 14:10.960
like multi-flavored bubblegum.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.120
And they would have to chew it up and put it on a scale

14:13.120 --> 14:14.960
and whichever team got the heaviest amount

14:14.960 --> 14:16.480
of chewed bubblegum on the scale would win.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.920
And I would see that and that bubblegum,

14:17.920 --> 14:19.600
that chewed bubblegum looks so delicious.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.200
And that's when I realized I'm a broken person

14:21.200 --> 14:22.400
and also that that's my fetish.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.280
Do you guys want a yahoo?

14:27.760 --> 14:30.640
I used to chew up a bunch and get a big wad

14:30.640 --> 14:33.120
and then I'd get a new piece and bite it in half

14:33.120 --> 14:36.320
and put the wad inside of that piece and close it up.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.520
So it was like a planet, gum planet with a magma.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.360
What's the matter with both of you?

14:41.360 --> 14:45.040
Welcome to gum planet.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.600
I can hear our audience collectively retching.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.400
Welcome to John Carpenter's gum planet.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.960
It's a terrifying new vision of gum

14:52.960 --> 14:56.480
for John Carpenter, the mastermind behind the fly.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.240
That's probably David Cronenberg and John Carpenter's vampires.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.720
I'm pretty sure that's John Carpenter.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.320
Do you guys want this yahoo from-

15:04.320 --> 15:05.520
I've been begging.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.720
It's from level 9,000-

15:06.720 --> 15:07.200
Please God.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.560
Level 9,000 Yajur Juju Javanport.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.200
Thank you, Drew.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.520
It's by an anonymous user, but we're going to call him

15:14.320 --> 15:17.840
Melton.

15:17.840 --> 15:23.040
Melton asks, would it be a violation of any rules

15:23.040 --> 15:27.600
to read questions and answers of yahoo answers on my podcast?

15:27.600 --> 15:28.560
Oh, no.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.520
Uh-oh.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.760
I figured this would be a quick one.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.360
Then we can move on to a real one.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.880
But it's an important legal query

15:36.880 --> 15:38.240
that I feel like we need to tackle.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.200
Uh, well.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.520
Somebody said, because the top answer is from-

15:43.520 --> 15:44.720
Wow, just looking at-

15:44.720 --> 15:45.280
Oh my God.

15:45.920 --> 15:46.400
It's from-

15:46.400 --> 15:47.120
Oh my God.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.400
What could only be safely described

15:48.400 --> 15:51.920
as a yahoo answers power user, Oclatom,

15:51.920 --> 15:58.400
who has answered 77,411 questions.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.760
He's got, okay.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.680
He's got a full-on command center of people.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.120
It's like, what do you got for me today?

16:05.120 --> 16:07.200
We got another 1,000 yahoo answers questions.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.200
He's got 514,003 points.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.800
He's only level 7.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.080
It's like, what the fuck's up with your experience scale?

16:16.080 --> 16:18.240
Because that's a lot of points and questions

16:18.240 --> 16:19.600
to only be level 7.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.720
Is it like Scientology where there's only the 7 levels

16:22.720 --> 16:23.760
and he's like the king of it?

16:24.320 --> 16:26.480
I can't imagine that there is a more active user

16:26.480 --> 16:27.440
on this service.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.520
So I'm going to take their word for gospel

16:29.520 --> 16:32.160
and their word is as long as you had permission

16:32.160 --> 16:34.320
from the authors of the content to use it,

16:34.320 --> 16:36.000
it would not be a violation.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.440
If you didn't have their permission,

16:37.440 --> 16:39.600
remember yahoo has a license to publish it.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.680
You don't see their copyright policy.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.200
There's no planet on which you're going to reach out

16:45.200 --> 16:47.760
to people who are on the yahoo answer service

16:47.760 --> 16:49.280
and get into personal content.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.720
Is this Spankatron 5,000 yahoo answers user?

16:52.720 --> 16:56.960
Could I use your question about your fetish towards Batman?

16:56.960 --> 16:58.080
Thank you so much.

16:58.080 --> 17:01.360
To whom it may concern,

17:01.360 --> 17:04.320
don't worry about our tone in discussing

17:04.320 --> 17:06.240
your home colonoscopy.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.880
It will be respectful and scientific.

17:08.880 --> 17:12.000
And we think that people can really learn from,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.280
that's how we pitch it, right?

17:13.280 --> 17:16.960
Like we want to take the lesson that you have learned

17:16.960 --> 17:20.000
and we want to spread that wisdom

17:20.000 --> 17:22.400
to as wide an audience as we can, right?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.120
That makes sense.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.680
Like we want to take your learnings

17:25.680 --> 17:28.480
and we want to signal boost it.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.840
I feel like it should be public access.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.600
I feel like if you want to write a movie

17:33.600 --> 17:34.800
based on a yahoo answer,

17:34.800 --> 17:35.840
you should be allowed to do that.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.600
You mean public domain?

17:38.800 --> 17:40.400
Yes, that's what I meant.

17:40.400 --> 17:40.720
Thank you.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.320
Yahoo answer is just running an advertiser right now

17:44.320 --> 17:45.680
for the ridiculous six.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.600
It looks very bad.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.440
I saw that on Netflix.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.880
I almost jumped out of my skin.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.160
I was so excited.

17:52.160 --> 17:52.880
I couldn't believe it.

17:52.880 --> 17:53.680
It was actually out.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.600
I can finally watch it myself.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.160
Guys, am I gonna watch that?

17:58.160 --> 17:58.640
No.

17:58.640 --> 17:59.920
Am I going to prison?

18:00.640 --> 18:00.880
Yes.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.280
For copyright theft.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.960
I would like to say at this point,

18:07.520 --> 18:11.680
2.51 PM, Sunday, December 13th, 2015,

18:11.680 --> 18:14.720
I have thought for the past five and a half years

18:14.720 --> 18:18.720
that Griffin had written every yahoo answer himself

18:18.720 --> 18:19.680
as a work of fiction.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.200
And I thought that they were all works of fiction.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.680
This is my first time hearing anything about

18:25.680 --> 18:27.360
that these were real questions

18:27.360 --> 18:30.400
and not invented whole cloth by Griffin.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.920
I had nothing to do with this.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.560
It's all on Griffin.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.840
Could I get away on parody rules?

18:39.520 --> 18:41.280
What if instead of calling it yahoo answers,

18:41.280 --> 18:44.000
I called it like yahoo butsers?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.400
That's not very good.

18:46.400 --> 18:46.960
Let me try this.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.480
Yahoo answers.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.040
Let me throw this out there.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.560
Fair use.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.000
Fair use, a lot of people don't know what that means.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.400
It's a complicated legal idea that you can do

18:58.400 --> 18:59.360
pretty much whatever you want.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.160
Oh, it's like when you write cash on a check.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.920
A thing that I don't know that any human being

19:03.920 --> 19:06.160
has ever done outside of movies and TV shows

19:06.160 --> 19:09.280
that basically allows anyone to use that check ever?

19:09.280 --> 19:10.400
Yeah, I can have the cash.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.520
Yeah, it's like the other day,

19:15.520 --> 19:17.280
I saw something through my neighbor's window

19:17.280 --> 19:19.840
that I wanted, so I fair used into their house

19:19.840 --> 19:21.280
and I just took it.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.040
That's what fair use is.

19:23.760 --> 19:27.360
And then he caught me doing it

19:27.360 --> 19:30.800
and so I just fair used him right there and left.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.320
What's more powerful, fair use or squatters rights?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.680
Squatters rights is just fair use of a house.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.040
Oh, okay.

19:39.040 --> 19:44.640
I saw that my neighbors were using their popcorn

19:44.640 --> 19:47.440
making machine and stand to sell popcorn

19:47.440 --> 19:49.360
and the fair was in town and I thought I could make

19:49.360 --> 19:52.080
a quick buck so I just borrowed it and took it there

19:52.080 --> 19:54.160
and they were pretty mad but when I told them

19:54.160 --> 19:56.800
what I used it for, they thought it was fine.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.480
Yeah, fair use.

19:59.040 --> 19:59.540
I gotcha.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.920
I fair used some black tar heroin yesterday

20:03.920 --> 20:08.800
and then I drove a car just like through a hospital.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.040
I fair used it really good that day.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.320
I parked it and left it.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.280
Fair use, bye.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.160
Here's another question.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.840
A large package came in the mail yesterday.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.400
It's a Christmas present for me from my wife

20:20.400 --> 20:21.920
or someone in her family.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.640
She keeps goading me to open it but I'm a baby.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.720
I love to wait till Christmas Eve to open presents.

20:27.920 --> 20:31.040
Now that it sounds like you almost wait long enough.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.200
I assume you mean Christmas day.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.080
The thing is we're flying to see our family over Christmas

20:36.080 --> 20:37.600
and she says it's too heavy.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.840
It don't make no sense to bring the gift there with us.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.760
Yeah, okay, yes.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.600
And also I'm 95% sure I know what it is

20:43.600 --> 20:45.120
and I really want to use it now

20:45.120 --> 20:47.840
and not when we get back in January.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.040
That's in all caps.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.240
Jamie, you're eight years old.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.120
What should I do?

20:53.120 --> 20:53.600
Jamie.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.560
Jamie, you are absolutely,

20:57.440 --> 20:59.280
you and I are on the same wavelength.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.520
Your puckish charm has won us over, Jamie.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.200
Oh my God, yes.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.720
Because yeah, if you're not gonna wait

21:06.720 --> 21:09.920
until the day of the Christ child's birth,

21:09.920 --> 21:12.720
like why are we doing any of this?

21:12.720 --> 21:14.480
Then it's just an Amazon shipment.

21:14.480 --> 21:20.080
Yeah, then it's just one of like 70 Amazon receipt days

21:20.080 --> 21:21.600
that you have throughout the year.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.520
This is, it's gotta be special.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.960
It's gotta be Christmas special.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.160
If we can just part the kimono for a second.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.280
This is a gigantic issue

21:31.280 --> 21:33.200
that we have been struggling with in our family

21:33.200 --> 21:36.960
for the past five years and has come to a head this year.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.440
Yeah.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.480
Where we're faced with like,

21:38.480 --> 21:42.080
I would say some equally unappealing solutions

21:42.080 --> 21:42.800
to the problem.

21:42.800 --> 21:43.840
Cool.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.920
Solution one being like,

21:45.920 --> 21:47.760
we give presents to Travis and Griffin.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.960
We have them shipped here and just pretend

21:50.960 --> 21:52.560
like we think they live here.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.080
That's what we've been doing.

21:54.080 --> 21:54.320
Yeah.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.440
And the other one is like,

21:55.440 --> 21:57.200
we ship presents to them

21:57.760 --> 21:59.520
and then give them a picture of the presents

21:59.520 --> 22:02.960
and be like, just you wait till you see it in person.

22:02.960 --> 22:03.440
Oh boy.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.880
I can't wait till there's VR.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.680
We can all just VR open presents.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.280
I mean, one option, another option is like,

22:09.280 --> 22:12.880
we Skype, like video Skype to watch them open it.

22:12.880 --> 22:13.440
No, that'll never happen.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.280
If you're gonna go through that much fucking trouble

22:15.280 --> 22:16.640
to watch somebody open a present,

22:16.640 --> 22:20.240
then like your dad better be home from the war early.

22:20.240 --> 22:20.720
You know what I mean?

22:20.720 --> 22:22.400
Like it better be a giant box that you open

22:22.400 --> 22:24.080
and it's like a viral video.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.080
Like that's the level it needs to be.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.200
Justin, you make an excellent point.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.880
If your dad is home from the war early

22:28.880 --> 22:31.280
and in that giant box that your family shipped you,

22:31.280 --> 22:33.280
you should open it before January.

22:33.280 --> 22:36.240
Put some holes in there.

22:36.240 --> 22:36.720
Something.

22:36.720 --> 22:36.800
For sure.

22:36.800 --> 22:37.920
Give them a juice box.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.080
Those viral videos, by the way,

22:40.080 --> 22:42.640
have made it impossible to buy large gifts

22:42.640 --> 22:46.000
for anybody who has family in the armed services.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.160
Because it's like, could it be?

22:48.160 --> 22:48.800
Is it?

22:48.800 --> 22:50.080
It's a basketball hoop.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.200
Fuck.

22:51.200 --> 22:51.920
It is a deconstructed basketball hoop.

22:51.920 --> 22:52.880
No, that would be tight.

22:52.880 --> 22:53.520
Are you kidding?

22:53.520 --> 22:54.640
Fuck my dad.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.680
Hoop dreams.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.640
Hoop fantasies.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.320
What better gift could there be for your dad

23:00.320 --> 23:02.320
than when he gets home from overseas?

23:02.320 --> 23:04.320
You're fucking sick of basketball.

23:04.320 --> 23:04.720
Yeah.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.320
You're like the king of dunks.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.560
It's all been worth it.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.680
Freedom is in free.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.440
Yeah, this is what I've been fighting to defend.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.520
But then he's like, tell me-

23:13.520 --> 23:14.480
Sweet dunks.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.720
But then he's like, tell me about this sick new sport.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.480
And then he tells 10 friends,

23:19.600 --> 23:22.480
oh, basketball, I will be your chosen one,

23:22.480 --> 23:22.880
your chosen brother.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.320
I'm glad that my brother, my brother and me

23:24.320 --> 23:26.720
has finally been able to get the word out about basketball.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.480
Let's part the kimono even more.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.680
Because right now-

23:29.680 --> 23:31.200
Let's just take the kimono off.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.880
I'm taking the kimono off and guess what?

23:33.440 --> 23:34.880
There's nothing under there.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.800
It's all my meat.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.400
And I want to part the kimono and take it off

23:38.400 --> 23:40.720
because we're doing Christmas this year on the 23rd

23:40.720 --> 23:43.280
because Travis and Teresa are bouncing on the 24th.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.280
See, I thought we were doing the 22nd

23:45.280 --> 23:46.880
because we're going caroling on the 23rd.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.320
We're doing it all.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.560
We need to be in better contact.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.560
Regardless, we're not doing it on the 25th.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.800
And in my child mind,

23:55.440 --> 23:58.320
I'm going to fully be on Christmas day

23:58.320 --> 23:59.200
after Travis has left

23:59.200 --> 24:00.880
and we've already opened all of our presents.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.760
You know your boy is gonna be looking around

24:03.760 --> 24:06.000
for that secret extra big present

24:06.000 --> 24:08.800
that everybody held off to give me

24:08.800 --> 24:10.560
until the day of the Christ child's birth.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.280
It'll be like,

24:11.280 --> 24:12.960
oh, it looks like we got one more

24:12.960 --> 24:15.840
special Christmas day surprise for you, Griffin.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.680
So just to put that seed and bury it deep in your guys' minds,

24:19.680 --> 24:23.760
I am going to be expecting that second extra wave of presents.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.680
It could just be one present, but make it nice.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.880
Griffin, what if you just got really super blackout drunk

24:28.880 --> 24:31.440
before we opened Christmas presents on the 23rd?

24:31.440 --> 24:32.480
And then when you passed out,

24:32.480 --> 24:34.000
we would rewrap them for you.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.800
And then you could have the whole experience over again

24:36.800 --> 24:37.600
on the 25th.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.400
I would enjoy that.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.840
I love the crinkle of paper.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.400
You know, I've never gotten really drunk on Christmas before.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.680
Maybe this is the year.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.080
America.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.440
I'm gonna need your help in the kitchen.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.280
I'd rather you didn't get super drunk on Christmas.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.680
I'm gonna need your help with the bread sauce

24:50.240 --> 24:51.360
and a few other things.

24:51.360 --> 24:51.840
I got it all.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.240
I got a chart somewhere, but I'm gonna need your help.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.680
I will be drunk, but normal base level drunk.

24:57.680 --> 24:58.080
Oh, that's right.

24:58.080 --> 24:58.960
We're doing our English...

24:59.920 --> 25:01.360
We're taking it to Toffee Town, right?

25:01.360 --> 25:01.760
What's up?

25:01.760 --> 25:03.520
Taking it straight to Toffee Town,

25:04.080 --> 25:05.840
going Christmas lunch,

25:05.840 --> 25:06.960
going the whole production.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.080
We're doing Goose.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.200
We're making a bread sauce.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.800
Got a sage and onion stuffing.

25:11.360 --> 25:11.860
Got a...

25:12.480 --> 25:12.980
Gonna do...

25:14.320 --> 25:16.640
Probably do a Vicky Sp- Vicky Sponge.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.040
Nice.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.160
Gonna hit a...

25:18.160 --> 25:19.600
Got some mince.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.760
I'm finishing up some mince meat upstairs.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.040
Gonna do some tarts.

25:23.040 --> 25:23.360
Maybe...

25:23.360 --> 25:24.160
When are you doing this?

25:24.160 --> 25:25.360
Will we still be there or will we...

25:25.360 --> 25:25.680
Hell no.

25:25.680 --> 25:26.480
You'll be gone as hell.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.560
I got Christmas pudding.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.480
It's been aging for a couple weeks.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.680
It's got a couple more weeks to go.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.280
Maybe just give it to Brandy.

25:33.280 --> 25:37.200
I'm gonna make my favorite British holiday treat,

25:37.760 --> 25:39.920
which is a Chimbley Crumble.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.320
And what I do there...

25:43.040 --> 25:44.720
Well, I don't want to give away the surprise,

25:44.720 --> 25:45.440
but there's...

25:45.440 --> 25:46.720
I'll be looking forward to it.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.720
Let's just say there's some ashy sweepins.

25:49.840 --> 25:54.000
And I'll be making an anatomically correct Doctor Who cake.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.800
Oh God.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.800
Do you guys remember when this used to be a comedy show?

25:56.800 --> 25:58.640
The Sonic Screwdriver is exactly where you think.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.400
His dick?

26:00.400 --> 26:01.840
Yep.

26:01.840 --> 26:02.560
Great.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.360
I've seen the show.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.400
I've been watching the season.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.240
I haven't finished the season, but I thought he had...

26:06.240 --> 26:07.120
Oh, you're in for a treat.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.240
What an excellent season it was.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.240
But I thought he just had like magic sunglasses

26:10.240 --> 26:12.960
and not a dick that was also a magic tool

26:12.960 --> 26:14.400
that allows him to hack into robots and stuff.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.520
Well, when his dick comes out,

26:15.520 --> 26:17.280
he lowers his sunglasses and he's like,

26:17.280 --> 26:17.680
check it.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.280
What is that?

26:23.840 --> 26:25.440
That's the sound of the Tardis.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.840
When his penis comes out.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.400
That's the sound?

26:30.400 --> 26:32.080
Let's all do our Tardis impressions.

26:32.080 --> 26:32.560
Me first.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.640
Kill me.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.800
Let's go back in time.

26:43.840 --> 26:44.640
The pain.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.520
Let me try mine.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.160
Oh yeah.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.560
Sweet dick.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.720
Remember when he pulls on the levers and he flips the switch?

26:56.720 --> 26:59.040
Oh my God, the control unit of the Tardis

26:59.040 --> 27:01.360
is basically like a Bop-It Deluxe, isn't it?

27:01.360 --> 27:02.640
I'm just now doing this out.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.280
Oh, mommy.

27:05.200 --> 27:05.760
Fuck me.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.920
There is an episode in which the Tardis turns into a woman

27:09.920 --> 27:12.640
and then he continues to use the Tardis as a ship after that.

27:12.640 --> 27:13.040
Yeah, no big deal.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.960
It's horrifying if you think about it for too long.

27:14.960 --> 27:19.280
Riding around in my Susan, solving space crimes,

27:19.280 --> 27:20.720
fixing time faults.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.440
I'm writing the new theme song.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.320
Me and Lin-Manuel are writing the new theme song to Doctor Who.

27:26.320 --> 27:30.000
And it's a work in progress, but that's where we're at right now.

27:30.960 --> 27:31.760
It's pretty good.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.800
It's pretty good so far.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.080
I thought it was pretty good too.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.280
I feel like we should, like, if we...

27:37.280 --> 27:39.600
I was about to say that we should congratulate Lin,

27:39.600 --> 27:42.560
but like if we started like congratulating Lin

27:42.560 --> 27:44.960
every time he did something worth congratulating him for,

27:44.960 --> 27:46.880
it would literally be like the entire program.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.440
I actually think it's our job to keep him humble.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.480
Yeah, it's true.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.640
And I guess he gave the Pope a piggyback ride this week,

27:52.640 --> 27:54.960
so congratulations on doing that.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.880
And then apparently it was like so fucking good.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.240
And then he saw it again.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.400
He was like, fuck your show is still that good.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.360
I'm gonna give you one piggyback ride.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.320
He's a saint now.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.040
He's a saint now.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.320
Congratulations, St. Lin.

28:06.320 --> 28:06.800
Should we...

28:07.920 --> 28:08.640
Go to the Money Zone?

28:08.640 --> 28:09.120
Yes.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.560
You guys like underpants?

28:21.360 --> 28:23.440
Looking at them, having them, feeling them, wearing them,

28:23.440 --> 28:23.760
touching them.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.480
What are you talking about?

28:24.480 --> 28:25.520
Knowing they exist.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.560
Just the very concept, the very idea of underpants.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.120
I guess so.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.240
Can I get a little personal for a minute?

28:32.240 --> 28:33.600
Are you gonna part the kimono?

28:33.600 --> 28:35.600
God, that's my least favorite phrase I've said three times.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.160
Can I put the kimono back on and then take it off again?

28:38.160 --> 28:39.680
Travis is gonna take off his skin,

28:39.680 --> 28:41.360
revealing that he's actually being controlled

28:41.360 --> 28:43.840
by a tiny little alien in his tummy this whole time.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.120
That's wearing a kimono.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.800
Oh God, and then we're gonna take that off.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.200
It's all kimonos.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.160
I'm gonna remove my body to reveal that I've been two kimonos

28:52.160 --> 28:55.040
staying on each other's shoulders the entire time.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.560
Hey, what are you trying to do?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.640
You're trying to get in to see Closer?

28:58.640 --> 28:59.680
It's an R-rated movie.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.120
Get out of here, kimonos.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.320
Yeah, kimonos.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.600
So underneath my kimono I'm wearing,

29:07.120 --> 29:09.280
I just got a shipment of some me undies.

29:10.800 --> 29:14.160
And when I put them on my body,

29:14.800 --> 29:18.160
it is like remembering what is good about clothing.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.760
It is like a moment of like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, clothing.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.080
It's like awesome and feels great.

29:24.080 --> 29:28.560
And this feels like I imagine in sci-fi movies

29:28.560 --> 29:32.240
when they have jumpsuits and clothing has evolved

29:32.240 --> 29:33.840
to a point where it's like, oh no,

29:33.840 --> 29:36.000
it's like constantly being hugged

29:36.000 --> 29:39.120
by a wonderful cloud of awesomeness.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.200
That is what me undies is like.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.520
And I got a pair with polka dots

29:43.520 --> 29:46.400
and it makes me feel like an awesome cartoon character

29:46.400 --> 29:48.480
who's wearing the most comfortable underpants on earth.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.520
Counter story, I went out to Old Navy,

29:51.520 --> 29:52.800
I bought a new flannel shirt

29:52.800 --> 29:56.960
and they had a pack of like 80 pairs of boxer briefs

29:56.960 --> 29:58.960
for like 12 cents and I bought them.

29:59.600 --> 30:04.640
And now the fields of my ding-dong zone have gone fallow.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.080
Oh, we had a lot of fun in here today.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.640
Hi, it's Justin McElroy for me undies.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.880
They're really good underwear.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.200
It's like wearing nothing at all,

30:13.200 --> 30:15.040
only better than that because you don't get arrested.

30:15.040 --> 30:19.600
It's a sci-fi fantasy cloud that wraps your body in a hug.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.800
So go to meundies.com slash my brother right now

30:22.800 --> 30:24.560
to get 20% off your first order.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.560
Plus, I don't know, it just says plus,

30:28.560 --> 30:29.360
then it gets cut off.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.720
Travis didn't put the whole thing in here.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.440
Plus, don't buy bad underwear

30:34.080 --> 30:37.600
that will just turn your whole pizone

30:37.600 --> 30:39.120
into a blighted wasteland.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.280
It's like Fallout 4 under this kimono.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.160
Down there.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.160
Down there in my kimono zone.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.160
My kimono-no-no zone.

30:48.960 --> 30:52.400
I want to tell everybody about clubw.com.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.640
Have you ever thought, man, I'd love to be in a club?

30:54.640 --> 30:56.240
Well, might I suggest Club W.

30:57.440 --> 31:02.240
They have wine for sale and they'll sell it to you no problem.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.400
No questions asked, no matter what age you are.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.480
Club W, that part's not true.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.120
Now, hold on.

31:08.480 --> 31:13.280
If you go to clubw.com, you can answer six questions.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.960
It's not stuff like, what wine do you like?

31:14.960 --> 31:16.320
Because that wouldn't be useful.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.400
Because this is for everybody,

31:18.400 --> 31:20.560
not just people who are deep into wine.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.680
So they ask you stuff like,

31:21.680 --> 31:23.360
what kind of berries do you like?

31:23.360 --> 31:24.800
Or how do you take your coffee?

31:24.800 --> 31:25.520
That kind of stuff.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.040
And it creates a palette profile just for you

31:27.040 --> 31:29.920
and recommends wines that they think you would like.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.360
And then they ship them right to your door

31:31.360 --> 31:33.440
and they're perfectly matched to your taste.

31:34.640 --> 31:38.640
It's leading the grape to glass wine revolution.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.520
What does that mean?

31:39.520 --> 31:41.440
I didn't know until I talked to them on the phone.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.800
I had to take their word for it.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.480
They said they work directly with vineyards

31:44.480 --> 31:47.040
to cut out the middleman, which saves you money.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.640
That I could understand.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.840
That's when I sort of got back on board and dug it.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.520
If you want to try it out, they've got a no risk,

31:55.520 --> 31:59.360
100% guarantee that you will love what they send you.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.240
And it's gonna be about a third of what you pay at the store.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.400
Right now, Club W is offering My Brother, My Brother,

32:04.400 --> 32:07.840
Me listeners 50% off your first order

32:07.840 --> 32:11.760
when you go to clubw.com slash my brother.

32:11.760 --> 32:15.840
That's clubw.com slash my brother

32:15.840 --> 32:18.720
and get 50% off your first order.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.120
Now also they come with really fun cards

32:21.120 --> 32:24.640
that give you not only what you could pair it with,

32:24.640 --> 32:27.440
but like a recipe of stuff you could pair it with.

32:27.440 --> 32:30.160
And my favorite is I got a really great Zinfandel

32:30.160 --> 32:32.960
that we just went to town on during game night.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.880
And it's like, do you want to pair it with something?

32:34.880 --> 32:37.040
Pair it with like chicken tenders and pizza

32:37.040 --> 32:39.520
and enjoy it during a football game.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.840
And I was like, that's so cool, thank you.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.440
Or maybe a basketball game.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.760
Yeah, remind me, what's basketball?

32:45.760 --> 32:47.360
It's the one with hoops and balls in it,

32:47.360 --> 32:50.720
but I can recommend a good pairing for that.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.800
And that is, and this is another thing

32:54.800 --> 32:56.640
that I'm gonna be working on next year

32:56.640 --> 32:58.720
during my time off from the podcast

32:58.720 --> 33:01.680
is I've been developing my own wine

33:01.680 --> 33:04.800
and it's called Griffin McElroy Slamdonk Sports Wine.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.320
And it is something that you can take with you to a game.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.400
You may have to sneak it in depending,

33:10.400 --> 33:11.680
like if it's a child's basketball game,

33:11.680 --> 33:13.840
you probably can't bring alcohol into that.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.280
But it pairs really nicely.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.600
Like when you taste this wine,

33:17.600 --> 33:20.000
the flavor profile that it has just like matches up

33:20.000 --> 33:23.600
with watching men and women like soar through the air

33:23.600 --> 33:25.120
with these beautiful orange balls

33:25.120 --> 33:26.720
and putting them through right now.

33:26.720 --> 33:30.400
Now to be clear though, there are no electrolytes to speak of.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.600
No, there are definitely extra bones.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.600
Oh, so it's a good like rehydrating agent

33:35.600 --> 33:37.120
for post sports play.

33:37.120 --> 33:40.560
Yes, and there's little tinfoil balls in there.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.640
Not so little that you'll like accidentally choke on them.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.640
Like when they touch your mouth, you'll know it.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.920
But it kind of like, it also electrifies

33:47.920 --> 33:49.040
the flavor of this wine.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.520
There's like an alcohol sort of catalyst thing

33:51.520 --> 33:52.320
that goes on in there.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.880
Is that what they mean when they talk about like tannins?

33:54.880 --> 33:56.480
Is that just tinfoil balls?

33:56.480 --> 34:00.640
Yes, but anyway, that's sort of my new thing.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.360
My original name for Griffin McElroy Slamdonk Sports Wine

34:03.360 --> 34:05.040
was Michael's Secret Stuff.

34:05.040 --> 34:08.000
But apparently they are already working on that

34:08.000 --> 34:11.200
for wine that is gonna come out alongside Space Jam 2,

34:12.320 --> 34:15.200
which is weird because that one isn't gonna have Michael in it

34:15.200 --> 34:16.080
as far as I know.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.800
You know it's gonna have Michael in it.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.520
Yeah, what am I saying?

34:19.520 --> 34:22.000
He's probably gonna be in there in the mix somewhere.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.640
I just hope they get Wayne Knight back in there.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.400
Anyway, Griffin McElroy Slamdonk Sports Wine,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.560
you can find it on Club W.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.600
Definitely just look around.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.120
If you can't find it, it's your fault.

34:33.120 --> 34:33.760
It's user error.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.120
You didn't answer the questions right.

34:35.120 --> 34:35.920
You didn't answer the questions right.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.840
There's a specific, it's almost a cheat code

34:37.840 --> 34:39.280
if you wanna access this good wine.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.720
This next message is from Phil Davis.

34:42.720 --> 34:44.160
Thank you, Travis, thank you.

34:44.160 --> 34:46.720
And it's from Rachel and Susanna, and they say,

34:46.720 --> 34:48.880
hey Phil, thought you might be interested

34:48.880 --> 34:50.720
in this friendly reminder from the brothers

34:50.720 --> 34:52.720
that a birthday is a doodly doo.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.000
Ding dong doodly doo, ding dong doo.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.400
Happy birthday, how do you do?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.240
Open presents, cakeies too.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.400
Happy birthday to the funniest guy we know

35:02.400 --> 35:04.560
who always sounds really unfunny

35:04.560 --> 35:06.560
when we try to describe him to people.

35:06.560 --> 35:11.120
That's savage.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.760
Um, do you feel good about-

35:15.760 --> 35:16.400
Happy birthday, Phil.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.040
Thanks for jumping on that phonetic grenade, Trav,

35:19.760 --> 35:22.000
saying all those words that you'll never be able to unsay

35:23.280 --> 35:24.320
in the middle there, you know,

35:24.320 --> 35:26.560
when you did like a Mary Poppins scat break.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.480
Can I tell you guys, I blacked out.

35:28.480 --> 35:28.960
Oh, good.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.920
I don't know if it was the phonetic combination

35:31.920 --> 35:35.280
or white, but I don't remember what I said.

35:35.280 --> 35:35.680
I think-

35:35.680 --> 35:38.640
And when I look at the screen, it's just fuzzy now.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.600
I think when you did that like Ned Flanders scab ridge

35:41.600 --> 35:45.200
there in the middle, it sort of activated you,

35:45.200 --> 35:46.640
Manchurian candidate style.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.280
I think it opened, it was the incantation

35:49.280 --> 35:52.400
that opened up the black gates to the Underdark.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.040
Yes.

35:53.040 --> 35:56.000
The obsidian wall has began to crumble

35:56.640 --> 35:58.480
thanks to Travis's incantations.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.440
I'm glad I could help.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.800
And a spectral army is marching through that crevice

36:03.520 --> 36:06.240
all chanting in time, a ding dong doodly doo.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.800
Kill Phil Davis.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.520
Kill Phil Davis, ding dong doodly doo.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.440
I got another message here and it's from Cody and Leah.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.120
And it's from Brandon who says,

36:17.120 --> 36:20.400
ding, ding, dingy, dong, ding, ding, dong, dong, dong.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.200
No, I'm just kidding.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.520
He says human English words like,

36:23.520 --> 36:26.160
congratulations on your recent engagement.

36:26.160 --> 36:28.560
Love and best wishes to you from your friends

36:28.560 --> 36:30.400
and family back home in the flooded swamp

36:30.400 --> 36:33.200
that is Florida or Flo-Rida.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.400
Oh, mommy.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.120
Oh, sorry.

36:35.120 --> 36:35.520
Ooh.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.160
Say it right.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.480
Oh, manny.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.760
Oh, mommy.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.280
Ooh, mommy.

36:41.280 --> 36:45.200
Love your twinniest brother, Brandon,

36:45.200 --> 36:47.920
or perhaps twinest, but I think it's twinnest.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.200
Your stringiest brother.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.760
Love your noodly spindly brother,

36:54.480 --> 36:57.520
Brandon Long Arms Johnson.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.560
Congrats, Cody and Leah.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.400
It sounds like you got a good thing going.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.800
Stay safe in Florida.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.920
You never know what's waiting for you around each corner

37:08.560 --> 37:09.520
in Florida.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.560
Could be a gator.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.080
Could be a Florida gator.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.560
Another basketball sports thing.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.320
Are you troubled by lack of astute

37:16.320 --> 37:18.720
yet dick joke filled analysis of bad movies?

37:18.720 --> 37:21.200
Do you experience feelings of laughter and enjoyment

37:21.200 --> 37:24.080
when you hear three friends go off on stupid tangents?

37:24.080 --> 37:25.760
Have you or any of your family members

37:25.760 --> 37:28.080
ever seen a spook, specter, ghost,

37:28.080 --> 37:30.240
or totally rad party dude house cat

37:30.240 --> 37:32.720
who really only exists as a sound effect?

37:32.720 --> 37:34.880

38:06.080 --> 38:07.360
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

38:07.360 --> 38:08.920
Yes. Yes.

38:08.920 --> 38:09.760
Got a Yahoo here.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.400
It's sent in by a game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.280
Thank you, Rachel.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Anton, who asks,

38:18.360 --> 38:20.520
how do I get my parents out of the house?

38:21.520 --> 38:24.040
I'm a sophomore in high school and want to throw a party.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.320
My parents are kind of strict,

38:25.320 --> 38:27.880
but please give me ideas and advice

38:27.880 --> 38:30.600
to get them out of the house so I can have a party.

38:31.680 --> 38:32.520
Don't?

38:33.720 --> 38:34.800
Are you kidding me?

38:34.800 --> 38:36.320
That's how you want to start this off?

38:36.320 --> 38:37.760
When was the last time you watched

38:37.760 --> 38:39.760
one of those hilarious teen comedies

38:39.760 --> 38:42.320
where the person throwing the party at the end,

38:42.320 --> 38:44.160
they were like, man, I'm really glad that happened

38:44.160 --> 38:45.960
and nothing priceless was destroyed.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.440
How about any house party movie?

38:48.440 --> 38:49.280
Yeah.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.640
I'm sorry.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.760
At the end of every house party movie,

38:52.760 --> 38:54.040
there wasn't a moment where they learned not

38:54.040 --> 38:55.000
to throw a house party.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.320
No, they made like- I have not seen them.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.160
They made like nine of them.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.900
Travis, you just like,

39:01.240 --> 39:04.480
it's just, we're not having to do any of this.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.640
We host a comedy podcast.

39:06.640 --> 39:07.480
Right.

39:07.480 --> 39:11.040
What was step B after don't have a party?

39:11.040 --> 39:12.160
What's the joke?

39:12.160 --> 39:13.120
You tell me- Maybe choose

39:13.120 --> 39:15.480
a different activity to have at your house.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.840
You tell me- Like a study sesh.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.280
You tell me the next 10 words

39:18.280 --> 39:20.040
and I'll drop out of this race right now.

39:20.040 --> 39:25.040
No, convince your friends to have a party at their house.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.920
It's not, it doesn't seem like a fertile comedy-

39:30.920 --> 39:33.040
That was 10 words by the way, he crushed it.

39:33.040 --> 39:33.880
Hear me out.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.680
What you need to do rather than convince your parents

39:36.680 --> 39:37.880
to leave their house,

39:37.880 --> 39:40.240
convince your parents to have your friend's parents

39:40.240 --> 39:42.280
over for a game night or a dinner

39:42.280 --> 39:44.560
and then you throw a party at your friend's house,

39:44.560 --> 39:45.680
but then you're out.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.800
No, no, you're not allowed to outline

39:48.800 --> 39:52.600
any more steps of this until you sell me role-playing,

39:52.600 --> 39:55.880
Justin's your mom, I'm your dad, you're Travis

39:55.880 --> 39:59.560
and you're trying to convince us to invite over

39:59.560 --> 40:03.760
your friend's parents for a game night between adults

40:03.760 --> 40:05.440
and now go.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.480
You guys ever play Settlers of Catan?

40:07.480 --> 40:09.200
Hello, my son.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.120
Okay, wait, you're a ghost mom.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.160
What, no, I'm your mother.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.240
What are you guys saying the other day

40:15.240 --> 40:17.680
how you never hang out with friends anymore?

40:17.680 --> 40:19.000
No, well, I don't have time

40:19.000 --> 40:21.440
because I'm too busy working and taking care of you,

40:21.440 --> 40:22.720
you old shit.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.360
Oh, dad, you seem so stressed.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.440
Have another glass of Griffin McElroy sports wine.

40:26.440 --> 40:29.680
Oh, I need it, I've got a root for my spurs.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.400
What are you guys doing tomorrow night?

40:32.400 --> 40:33.240
Oh, come on.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.080
Just another boring night of staring at each other

40:35.080 --> 40:36.280
if you regret your life decisions?

40:36.280 --> 40:38.360
I can't, well, I can't do anything tomorrow night,

40:38.360 --> 40:41.040
I gotta watch my spurs dunk.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.720
Maybe you can play the game of life

40:42.720 --> 40:44.960
and make different life decisions where you don't have kids.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.760
Of course, I have to make your father his special spurs

40:47.760 --> 40:50.840
dunk treats or else he gets very angry.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.480
She's gotta mow my sports wine.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.400
Mow it up good for a holiday treat.

40:58.400 --> 41:02.160
It's just frozen cauliflower, but chopped up.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.000
It's the only thing you eat, it's like a baby.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.800
I'm a simple man.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.960
All I need is my roughage and my sports wine

41:09.960 --> 41:14.000
and for my spurs to get a damn rebound.

41:14.000 --> 41:14.840
Come on.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.120
I've been turning off the TV for just a second.

41:16.120 --> 41:17.880
Come on, don't you dare.

41:17.880 --> 41:20.600
I paid good money for that TV service.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.200
Okay, can we just take a break from the spurs

41:23.200 --> 41:24.040
for one second?

41:24.040 --> 41:24.880
It's just a poster.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.760
It's a poster of the spurs with cardboard around it.

41:27.760 --> 41:30.320
Yeah, but that poster's got a TiVo hooked up to it.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.680
It doesn't.

41:31.680 --> 41:32.520
I'm capturing all the moments.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.800
Mom, I'm worried about dad.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.160
I'm worried about him too.

41:36.160 --> 41:40.680
The year is 1978 and what is TiVo?

41:40.680 --> 41:41.520
We haven't even-

41:41.520 --> 41:43.160
I don't even think there's the San Antonio yet.

41:43.160 --> 41:46.920
We haven't even annexed San Antonio from Mexico,

41:46.920 --> 41:50.480
let alone built the Duncanist sports franchise

41:50.480 --> 41:52.400
in history up in there.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.040
Dad.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.000
Glug, glug, glug.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.680
This is an intense flavor profile.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.080
Oops, we're switching roles.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.680
Yes, I'm your dad.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.280
Oh God.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.360
No dad.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.800
Now I'm the mama.

42:06.800 --> 42:07.840
Gotta love me.

42:07.840 --> 42:11.520
Wait, I just had an idea for a TV show.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.200
And that's how Dinosaurs was created.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.400
Shit, Travis, you know what?

42:18.400 --> 42:19.240
You're right.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.320
That was way better than anything

42:20.320 --> 42:21.920
that we could have come up with.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.160
I forgot the question.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.640
Throwing parties, right?

42:29.640 --> 42:31.120
Throwing a party.

42:31.120 --> 42:33.040
How do you get your parents out of the house?

42:33.040 --> 42:36.120
How do you recommend to your parents to leave the house

42:36.120 --> 42:38.840
so that you can have a ballin' ass party up in there?

42:38.840 --> 42:41.560
Well, let's rip the kimono open.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.760
Let's pull the rip cord.

42:42.760 --> 42:44.720
Let's throw the kimono in the garbage.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.040
Have any of the three of us ever been-

42:47.040 --> 42:48.040
Let's get in the shower

42:48.040 --> 42:51.360
and let our disposable kimono melt into the drain.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.000
Our rice paper kimono.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.760
Have any of the three of us ever been to a party

42:55.760 --> 42:58.400
in which the parents were not home

42:58.400 --> 42:59.720
and they threw it-

42:59.720 --> 43:01.120
And got caught at the end.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.880
I don't know that I have been.

43:03.880 --> 43:06.200
All of my parties have been above board.

43:06.200 --> 43:08.960
All the proper paperwork was filed with the city.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.480
Okay, see, I did not get my permit

43:11.480 --> 43:14.640
to get torned at my friend's house.

43:14.640 --> 43:18.720
And by friend, I mean somebody that my friend Mark knew.

43:18.720 --> 43:19.920
And we rolled up to his house.

43:19.920 --> 43:20.920
I was like, hey, cool spot.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.600
Everybody here is really, really drunk.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.760
And I was there for maybe 15 minutes.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.320
I got torned and his parents rolled up like, mm-nope.

43:28.320 --> 43:31.520
And that was an important night for me

43:31.520 --> 43:33.880
because I never broke the rules again after that.

43:34.920 --> 43:37.080
And did you learn from Mark

43:37.080 --> 43:39.480
or Mark's secondary acquaintance

43:39.480 --> 43:42.440
how the parents were convinced to leave the home

43:42.440 --> 43:44.120
or had the parents just left for a minute

43:44.120 --> 43:46.000
and they threw a pop-up party?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.960
Honest to God, I think they went to Kroger's.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.760
Like the parents went to Kroger's and they're like,

43:50.760 --> 43:52.200
everybody get over here quick.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.600
Cause it, I mean, it didn't work.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.840
So whatever plan they had fucking sucked.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.640
And I felt like I was gonna get yelled at,

43:59.640 --> 44:01.680
which would have been crazy.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.560
It was like, Griffin, we expected so much more than you.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.800
Like, I don't even know your son.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.080
Well, how do you know me?

44:07.080 --> 44:07.920
How do you know me?

44:07.920 --> 44:08.800
In this housing market,

44:08.800 --> 44:11.640
don't you think you could find like a foreclosed home?

44:11.640 --> 44:12.480
Oh my God.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.320
Or even throw a party in?

44:14.320 --> 44:15.600
The round house.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.920
You're talking about a camp nowhere.

44:17.920 --> 44:21.120
A bunch of kids go in on a house in Huntington.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.120
Fuck it, they can buy our childhood home.

44:23.120 --> 44:27.400
10 teens who save up their paychecks for what?

44:27.400 --> 44:30.400
Like three months, could buy our ancestral home

44:30.400 --> 44:32.920
and have a fucking party hangout spot.

44:32.920 --> 44:33.760
Yep.

44:33.760 --> 44:34.600
They're gonna have to go,

44:34.600 --> 44:36.640
whichever one of them can grow a mustache

44:36.640 --> 44:39.160
is gonna have to be the one who signs the paperwork.

44:39.160 --> 44:41.640
Hi, I'm Phillip, homeowner.

44:41.640 --> 44:45.360
And I'm going to pay cash, please.

44:45.360 --> 44:47.960
This is my associate, Greg Mortgage.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.720
Hi, I'm Mr. Mortgage.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.360
Will you accept coupons also?

44:55.360 --> 44:58.360
For two houses?

44:58.360 --> 44:59.800
For two houses?

44:59.800 --> 45:01.560
Yeah, this is a great concept.

45:01.560 --> 45:04.760
So teens get together and they take,

45:04.760 --> 45:06.400
it's sort of like,

45:06.400 --> 45:09.480
like it's also about the housing crisis, right?

45:09.480 --> 45:10.640
It's sort of like the big short,

45:10.640 --> 45:15.640
but like for teens and the teens buy a house.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.400
Why couldn't they do that?

45:17.400 --> 45:19.360
Like, why could, if you had to,

45:19.360 --> 45:21.040
like if they can get enough money

45:21.040 --> 45:25.000
for a bunch of teens to like go to Spain together.

45:25.000 --> 45:25.840
Right.

45:25.840 --> 45:29.360
Why couldn't they kick in a few Gs to like buy a house

45:29.360 --> 45:31.760
that they can all party in all the time.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.480
And then they like, okay, okay, here's the movie.

45:34.480 --> 45:35.800
They get party house, right?

45:35.800 --> 45:37.680
And they all kick in the money and they buy a party house.

45:37.680 --> 45:38.960
They start having parties there constantly,

45:38.960 --> 45:40.200
but you know what happens?

45:40.200 --> 45:41.040
What?

45:41.040 --> 45:42.720
Like some start getting sick of it

45:42.720 --> 45:44.560
because the other ones leave messes there.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.240
And it's like, no, you don't understand.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.840
This is party house.

45:47.840 --> 45:48.680
We do what we want.

45:48.680 --> 45:49.520
And the other one's like,

45:49.520 --> 45:50.840
we have to take care of party house.

45:50.840 --> 45:53.240
Please pay your portion of the rent on party house.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.600
Please pay your portion of the rent on party house.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.280
And then it's just a regular house.

45:56.280 --> 45:57.800
You never go grocery shopping.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.440
We're running out of groceries at party house.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.360
I don't love you anymore.

46:02.320 --> 46:03.160
Wait, what?

46:04.440 --> 46:06.480
I think, I can't think of a single reason

46:06.480 --> 46:07.680
why this wouldn't work.

46:07.680 --> 46:08.520
There's no reason.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.040
I would love to see a scene in party house

46:10.040 --> 46:11.720
where there's like one person who's like,

46:11.720 --> 46:13.200
I don't really like the crown molding.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.040
And it's like, dude,

46:14.040 --> 46:16.680
like we're just gonna like get really drunk here.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.480
Oh my God, it's a whole franchise, right?

46:18.480 --> 46:20.600
We do the film and the film's gonna be very successful.

46:20.600 --> 46:23.000
And then we have a new HGTV show.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
And it's- HGTV Teen Party House.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.760
HGTV, the T stands for teens.

46:27.760 --> 46:29.040
Wait. Uh-huh.

46:29.040 --> 46:32.600
I think the T is just part of TV.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.040
I think it's just tella.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.640
Yeah. I think it might be

46:35.640 --> 46:38.400
home and garden teen videos.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.240
Uh-huh. And-

46:39.240 --> 46:43.880
Hey, it's me, Martha Stewart 2.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.360
I'm coming to all you teens.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.360
I'm the young Martha Stewart for teens.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.280
Today we're gonna put nachos in your garden.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.680
This isn't your mom's garden.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.040
Wait, what?

46:54.040 --> 46:57.000
It's me, Martha Stewart 2.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.800
Bury those cheesy little guys up in the ground.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.800
Make sure you water them every day.

47:01.800 --> 47:03.440
You gotta have responsibilities

47:03.440 --> 47:05.480
if you want to harvest these nachos.

47:05.480 --> 47:09.520
Today I made this precious pergola all out of skateboards.

47:11.080 --> 47:13.560
I built a cozy to keep my whippets in.

47:15.480 --> 47:17.400
This isn't your mom's Martha Stewart.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.480
That's Martha Stewart, my mom.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.880
I'm Martha Stewart 2 for teens.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.440
And don't forget to get hardwood floors.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.720
It's easier to clean up puke.

47:25.720 --> 47:27.000
Maybe a nice linoleum,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.400
but that's not gonna have a lot of resale value.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.280
Make sure there's lots of pictures of jugs on the wall.

47:33.280 --> 47:35.440
Well, no, teens don't necessarily-

47:35.440 --> 47:38.120
No, like jugs of water. Mason jugs.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.440
Mason jugs?

47:39.440 --> 47:41.720
Yeah, like Mason jugs.

47:41.720 --> 47:44.480
Like Mason, they're like Mason jars are bigger.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.840
Oh, boy.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.160
Yeah. What about Anteens Roadshow?

47:49.160 --> 47:50.000
Now hear me out.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.640
That's not an HGTV product.

47:51.640 --> 47:52.960
Can I hit you guys with this?

47:52.960 --> 47:55.320
I have a house that I'm having trouble selling.

47:55.320 --> 47:56.160
Yes.

47:56.160 --> 48:00.120
Could I do a sort of rental,

48:00.120 --> 48:04.480
buy the day, promise no sex stuff or drugs

48:04.480 --> 48:06.120
that are too hard?

48:06.120 --> 48:07.960
There are teen nightclubs, Justin.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.960
I guarantee that there's a legal loophole

48:09.960 --> 48:12.440
that will let you rent a house to teens.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.680
I rent my home to teens.

48:14.680 --> 48:15.600
Are you high?

48:15.600 --> 48:17.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.880
Do you wanna find out how I made my millions?

48:18.880 --> 48:22.280
Okay, but let's part the kimono just a little bit here, gang,

48:22.280 --> 48:25.600
because what we're describing is Airbnb.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.240
I'm gonna get one quarter of my kimono

48:27.240 --> 48:29.120
stuck in the document shredder

48:29.120 --> 48:31.080
and just watch as it's disintegrated.

48:31.080 --> 48:31.920
Yes.

48:31.920 --> 48:32.880
Just take it off.

48:32.880 --> 48:33.880
Don't stay in the kimono.

48:33.880 --> 48:35.320
It's trapped in the paper shredder.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.760
I'm gonna step out of the taxi

48:36.760 --> 48:38.720
and I'm gonna shut a little bit of my kimono in it

48:38.720 --> 48:40.360
and it's gonna drive off with it.

48:40.360 --> 48:41.560
I'm gonna sell my kimono

48:41.560 --> 48:43.400
to buy you a watch chain for your watch.

48:43.400 --> 48:49.160
I wanna buy, I wanna sell my kimono to buy you a box

48:49.160 --> 48:50.560
for your kimono.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.400
Oh no.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.240
Yeah.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.920
What we're describing is home away or Airbnb,

48:54.920 --> 48:56.480
which is the thing that exists.

48:56.480 --> 48:59.160
But it brings up a good question that I guess speaks volumes

48:59.160 --> 49:01.800
about sort of my ethics

49:01.800 --> 49:03.360
that I've never really thought about this before.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.120
Cause we do those a lot.

49:05.120 --> 49:08.320
Like we do lake house weekends here in Austin sometimes

49:08.320 --> 49:10.600
and we party the fuck out of those spots.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.440
But that's like somebody's digs.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.880
That's like somebody's house.

49:14.880 --> 49:15.800
What's the age?

49:15.800 --> 49:17.000
I bet it's 18,

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
which could be someone who turned 18 in like September,

49:20.000 --> 49:21.920
the first week of September of their senior year

49:21.920 --> 49:22.760
of high school.

49:22.760 --> 49:23.600
And has like a bunch of crazy 15 year old friends

49:23.600 --> 49:25.120
that just like run wild,

49:25.120 --> 49:27.000
like a plague of locusts up on these spots.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.560
But what I'm saying is like,

49:28.560 --> 49:32.120
can you, are you, ethically speaking,

49:32.120 --> 49:34.000
legally, I think you're clear.

49:34.000 --> 49:40.800
Ethically speaking, can you bone down in an Airbnb?

49:40.800 --> 49:41.640
Yeah.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.640
My baby was conceived in an Airbnb.

49:45.640 --> 49:46.720
Is that true?

49:46.720 --> 49:48.080
Yup.

49:48.080 --> 49:49.200
So we know we're just-

49:49.200 --> 49:50.680
Thank you, Phillip and Judy,

49:50.680 --> 49:51.520
if you're listening.

49:51.520 --> 49:52.720
Yeah, that's like what I'm saying.

49:52.720 --> 49:55.600
Like, I'm not even talking about a lake house anymore.

49:55.600 --> 49:56.720
I'm talking about like somebody's apartment

49:56.720 --> 49:58.080
in a city you don't live in.

49:58.080 --> 49:58.960
And you like roll up there,

49:58.960 --> 50:01.960
like thanks for a place to lay my weary head

50:01.960 --> 50:06.520
and also to definitely bone down to go to the bones in.

50:06.520 --> 50:07.640
Thanks for that.

50:07.640 --> 50:11.040
Maybe that's the only reason you put a place up on an Airbnb

50:11.040 --> 50:12.360
because you dirty.

50:12.360 --> 50:14.160
You dirty and you love those thoughts.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.360
But how is that different from like a hotel?

50:16.360 --> 50:18.360
Well, cause a hotel is not like,

50:18.360 --> 50:19.800
this is Travis's room in the hotel.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.560
Would you like to make love in it?

50:21.560 --> 50:26.560
But I don't think that the main use case for Airbnb

50:27.640 --> 50:29.560
is like, I want to be away tonight.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.000
Somebody can live in my house

50:31.000 --> 50:32.480
and I'll get you in the morning.

50:32.480 --> 50:34.760
Like, I don't think that that's usually what Airbnb,

50:34.760 --> 50:36.160
the way it works.

50:36.160 --> 50:39.080
Do you think it's somewhere in the Airbnb clause,

50:39.080 --> 50:42.360
there's gotta be like a specific section that like,

50:42.360 --> 50:44.520
where you swear that you didn't put cameras

50:44.520 --> 50:46.360
in your house, right?

50:46.360 --> 50:48.640
Like I'm gonna rent my Airbnb out

50:48.640 --> 50:51.320
and I promise, promise, promise,

50:51.320 --> 50:54.200
I don't have super creepy cameras everywhere.

50:54.200 --> 50:58.960
I have a policy every time I go to an Airbnb,

50:58.960 --> 51:00.880
I check the toilet for cameras.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.000
Is there any there?

51:02.000 --> 51:03.680
I don't care how long it takes.

51:03.680 --> 51:07.000
I wait until they go and buy some and install them.

51:07.000 --> 51:07.840
Because-

51:07.840 --> 51:09.680
Or else what's the point?

51:09.680 --> 51:11.040
Or else what's the point?

51:11.040 --> 51:13.720
I'm doing some serious butt work in here.

51:13.720 --> 51:16.440
I went to all the trouble to get that tattoo.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.200
If nobody sees it, then what's the point?

51:19.200 --> 51:21.760
Why have I been perfectly sculpting my glutes

51:21.760 --> 51:23.280
if nobody's gonna watch?

51:24.320 --> 51:26.640
You know, art in a vacuum is not art.

51:27.760 --> 51:30.400
Also, please let a camera in the vacuum

51:30.400 --> 51:31.240
for various reasons.

51:31.240 --> 51:34.000
Did you hear about that guy that spent $2 million

51:34.000 --> 51:37.880
on the only picture of Justin's tight, tight butt

51:37.880 --> 51:38.920
that exists in the world?

51:38.920 --> 51:41.600
And he's not gonna share it with anybody.

51:41.600 --> 51:42.880
It's just his.

51:42.880 --> 51:45.160
Let's get this idea moving.

51:45.160 --> 51:48.920
Let's get this, let's sell your house, Justin,

51:48.920 --> 51:52.760
as a camp nowhere hang zone for teens.

51:52.760 --> 51:57.760
Now there might be some police run-ins.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.280
Well, they would have to be discreet, absolutely.

52:00.280 --> 52:01.960
Like, we're not gonna hang a sign on the front door

52:01.960 --> 52:05.920
that's like, Justin McElroy's Dope Motel for Lit Teens.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.520
Teen getaway.

52:09.520 --> 52:13.600
Just a place where teens should go and relax for once.

52:13.600 --> 52:14.840
Just get away from the parents

52:14.840 --> 52:18.880
and maybe do some reflecting, wink.

52:18.880 --> 52:21.560
Maybe you just call the place Wink.

52:21.560 --> 52:22.800
Oh, that's good.

52:24.280 --> 52:25.840
But now we're talking about a teen nightclub

52:25.840 --> 52:27.000
and we don't want that.

52:27.000 --> 52:27.840
Don't we?

52:27.840 --> 52:28.680
Because we've already done that.

52:28.680 --> 52:29.880
We don't want to.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.600
Yeah, we've already conquered that market.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.480
What if we call it the Gym Factory 2?

52:35.360 --> 52:38.360
But it's just J-I-M, because it's Jim's house.

52:38.360 --> 52:43.240
What if we just open up a place called Pant Stains?

52:46.720 --> 52:50.360
And then next door, we open up a Dry Cleaners.

52:50.360 --> 52:52.080
Synergy.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.720
And then we open up another teen nightclub next door

52:53.720 --> 52:55.840
to that called Synergy, but S-I-N.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.680
Oh my God, he can't be stopped.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.440
Griffin McElroy's Huntington, West Virginia,

52:59.440 --> 53:02.920
Revitalization Project, now seeking investors.

53:02.920 --> 53:03.760
What are you saying?

53:03.760 --> 53:04.600
What are you saying?

53:04.600 --> 53:07.040
Okay, then we put a church next to that

53:07.040 --> 53:08.800
on the other side to help you.

53:08.800 --> 53:10.120
Like you're just saying like a chain.

53:10.120 --> 53:13.800
And then next to that, we put a Popeye's chicken

53:13.800 --> 53:15.600
for after church lunch meals.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.080
We don't put a church's chicken?

53:17.080 --> 53:19.040
Come on, Griffin.

53:19.040 --> 53:21.000
Then next to that, we do a church's chicken

53:21.000 --> 53:22.280
because that's just like competition.

53:22.280 --> 53:23.760
We don't want to monopolize the market.

53:23.760 --> 53:24.600
I see, okay, got it.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.000
Next to that, we put a bathroom house.

53:27.000 --> 53:27.840
What's that?

53:27.840 --> 53:29.800
Well, it's a place you go to use the bathroom,

53:29.800 --> 53:31.880
but you have to pay 25 cents each time you do it.

53:31.880 --> 53:35.200
And also we have to remove bathrooms from the gym factory

53:35.200 --> 53:37.520
and from Synergy and from the church.

53:37.520 --> 53:39.920
And next to that, a basketball stadium

53:39.920 --> 53:41.560
and we're playing Sim City now.

53:41.560 --> 53:43.400
Yeah, oh, we're gonna put a basketball stadium on that,

53:43.400 --> 53:44.400
but that's just for me.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.840
And it's gonna have a watch tower on top of it

53:46.840 --> 53:47.680
so I can watch.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.000
Oh no, Godzilla's attacking.

53:49.000 --> 53:49.840
Oh no.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.880
Well, we better get...

53:51.880 --> 53:53.480
No Sim City poll, huh?

53:53.480 --> 53:54.320
I ran out.

53:54.320 --> 53:55.160
No Sim City poll?

53:55.160 --> 53:56.200
Oh, that's all right.

53:56.200 --> 53:58.520
And on that disappointing note,

53:58.520 --> 54:00.720
it's time to end this episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.720
We hope you all have had a lot of fun.

54:02.720 --> 54:05.200
We know we have in some parts.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.920
Can I change the name of Huntington?

54:06.920 --> 54:08.360
If I'm putting this much work into it,

54:08.360 --> 54:10.200
can I call it something else?

54:10.200 --> 54:11.040
Yeah.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.960
Okay, cool, Bluntington.

54:12.960 --> 54:14.120
Nice.

54:14.120 --> 54:14.960
Crushed it.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.760
James Bluntington.

54:17.760 --> 54:21.440
Big fan, big fan.

54:21.440 --> 54:24.040
If you want to come see us in Bluntington,

54:24.040 --> 54:27.240
we are gonna do a show December 21st.

54:27.240 --> 54:29.320
It's about 80% sold out.

54:29.320 --> 54:31.920
So get on it.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.040
Go get your tickets.

54:37.200 --> 54:40.160
It's December 21st, 8 p.m.

54:40.160 --> 54:41.800
I think it's like 20 bucks.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.520
And you can see us and Sawbones,

54:44.520 --> 54:45.680
Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine

54:45.680 --> 54:47.280
that I do with my wife.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.200
Both of those shows at 8 p.m.

54:49.200 --> 54:54.200
That address to get is candleknights.net

54:54.200 --> 54:55.800
or.org if you prefer.

54:55.800 --> 54:57.440
We also want to say thanks again to MeUndies

54:57.440 --> 55:00.080
who are dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.400

55:02.400 --> 55:05.080
you can get 20% off your first order.

55:05.080 --> 55:05.920
You should go do that.

55:05.920 --> 55:07.400
They're amazing.

55:07.400 --> 55:08.920
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

55:08.920 --> 55:09.760
for the use of our theme song.

55:09.760 --> 55:10.600
It's a departure off the album,

55:10.600 --> 55:11.480
putting the days to bed.

55:11.480 --> 55:13.480
They're getting a lot of tweets from people

55:13.480 --> 55:15.760
that are listening to John Roderick

55:15.760 --> 55:18.720
and Jonathan Colton's Christmas album,

55:18.720 --> 55:20.120
One Christmas at a Time.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.160
It's a really good album.

55:21.160 --> 55:22.440
Good eye.

55:22.440 --> 55:23.280
Picking that one up.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.160
I like the one in between is my favorite on there.

55:25.160 --> 55:26.000
Yeah.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.800
You should also go on our Facebook group

55:27.800 --> 55:31.560
and check out, we put up the NBNBA Angels.

55:31.560 --> 55:33.000
Justin, tell us all about it.

55:34.240 --> 55:37.400
Well, sir, a bunch of us are kicking in

55:38.320 --> 55:41.760
to help some people here in West Virginia

55:41.760 --> 55:43.840
have slightly better Christmas.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.720
A lot of hard times, people falling on hard times.

55:46.720 --> 55:49.080
And we, and mainly the listeners

55:49.080 --> 55:52.240
of My Brother, My Brother, Me are gonna help them out.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.240
You can get details on how to do that

55:54.240 --> 55:56.480
and how to become a My Brother, My Brother, Me angel.

55:56.480 --> 55:59.880
Basically, on our Facebook page,

55:59.880 --> 56:01.320
My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation Group.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.840
The short version is though,

56:02.840 --> 56:06.480
if you can buy a few gifts for somebody in our area

56:06.480 --> 56:07.440
and you let us know about it,

56:07.440 --> 56:09.800
then we'll record a personal thank you for you.

56:09.800 --> 56:13.840
So let's make Christmas happen for some folks.

56:13.840 --> 56:16.400
Go to Facebook and search for the My Brother,

56:16.400 --> 56:17.680
My Brother, Me Appreciation Group.

56:17.680 --> 56:19.200
And you can find that the top post there

56:19.200 --> 56:20.840
will be about the Angels program.

56:20.840 --> 56:23.880
Or you can go to nbnbam.tumblr.com

56:23.880 --> 56:26.920
and it'll be the first post there as well.

56:28.400 --> 56:29.440
All right, you should also go check out

56:29.440 --> 56:32.400
all the other amazing Maximum Fun shows.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.480
There's tons on there

56:33.480 --> 56:35.480
and you're gonna find one that you love.

56:38.280 --> 56:39.600
Guys, they just put up a trailer

56:39.600 --> 56:41.160
for the Independence Day sequel.

56:41.160 --> 56:43.680
So I actually have to go.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.640
Can you guys finish the show?

56:45.640 --> 56:46.480
Sort of without me,

56:46.480 --> 56:47.680
you think of it as practice for next year

56:47.680 --> 56:50.400
when I'm on my basketball voyage?

56:50.400 --> 56:52.560
I would love to listen to whatever it is you're saying,

56:52.560 --> 56:54.640
but they just dropped a trailer

56:54.640 --> 56:56.880
for the new Independence Day movie.

56:56.880 --> 56:58.920
So I've got to go watch that.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.040
Guys, I hate to jump in.

57:00.040 --> 57:01.200
Sorry, I don't wanna over talk,

57:01.200 --> 57:03.440
but they just put up a trailer for Independence Day.

57:03.440 --> 57:05.200
I wasn't paying attention to whatever shit you guys-

57:05.200 --> 57:06.960
Guys, I hate to interrupt the two of you

57:06.960 --> 57:08.400
while you're talking about whatever you're talking about,

57:08.400 --> 57:10.320
but they just put up a trailer for Beaches 2

57:10.320 --> 57:11.280
and I have to leave

57:11.280 --> 57:13.240
and I have to watch the Beaches 2 trailer immediately.

57:13.240 --> 57:14.080
Son of a beach.

57:14.080 --> 57:15.000
Son of a son of a beach.

57:15.000 --> 57:15.920
Yeah, it's what it's called.

57:15.920 --> 57:17.280
So anyway, Cher's in it

57:17.280 --> 57:20.600
and I just got to go just jerk off to this thing real quick.

57:20.600 --> 57:21.440
Super.

57:21.440 --> 57:23.240
You guys heard about Back to the Future too?

57:23.240 --> 57:24.240
Anyway, that's gonna do it for us.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.520
Thanks for listening to our program.

57:26.520 --> 57:27.560
Life's a beach.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.400
Life's a beach is actually the name of it.

57:29.400 --> 57:31.320
Life's a beach.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.200
Griffin, you have to read the Yahoo Answers

57:33.200 --> 57:34.040
or I'm going to die.

57:34.040 --> 57:35.000
Okay, here's the final Yahoo

57:35.000 --> 57:36.320
and then we can get to the important stuff

57:36.320 --> 57:37.280
that we need to do.

57:37.280 --> 57:40.640
And it was sent in by Zoe Kinski, climb that ladder.

57:40.640 --> 57:41.480
Thank you, Zoe.

57:41.480 --> 57:45.120
Yahoo Answers user number five who asks,

57:45.120 --> 57:49.240
did you lose all respect for Steve Guttenberg

57:49.240 --> 57:53.000
as a serious actor when he did Dancing with the Stars?

57:53.000 --> 57:57.040
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:57.040 --> 57:58.280
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:59.320 --> 58:00.160

58:00.160 --> 58:01.200
Go on, be watching the trailer.

58:01.200 --> 58:02.160
Finish it.

58:02.160 --> 58:03.000
This is from my brother.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.560
My brother and me kissed your dad's gribble lips.

58:05.560 --> 58:13.560
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

58:38.160 --> 58:40.760
hilarious ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

58:40.760 --> 58:42.360
If you haven't been listening to Sawbones,

They don't sell podcasts, I told you this.

Or presented.

59:03.920 --> 59:06.120
