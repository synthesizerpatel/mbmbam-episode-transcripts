00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.360
Hello, welcome to my brother and my brother and me special Valentine's Day edition for Lovers.

00:49.360 --> 00:55.200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, Lovers. I'm your... I can't go on this journey with you.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.200
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy. Kiss my mouth, it's covered in oil.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.480
I respect you as friends. My mouth is covered in kissing

01:02.480 --> 01:06.400
oil. Oh God, what is that?

01:06.400 --> 01:09.040
Kissing oil. Kissing oil, I bought it at...

01:09.040 --> 01:12.960
From whom? I bought it from a man at Hardee's.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.080
Oh God. I was at Hardee's,

01:16.080 --> 01:20.000
and I bought kissing oil from a man. Was he an employee of Hardee's,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.120
or was he just there? He was a man in a bathroom,

01:23.120 --> 01:28.080
and he had a guy, Fox Mask, and he told me he would help me kiss better.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.040
I'm Griffin and the baby. Oh no.

01:31.040 --> 01:39.040
Guys, let's compare and contrast our Valentine's Day experiences,

01:39.040 --> 01:44.560
because I am willing to bet that I had not only the worst of the three people on this podcast,

01:45.280 --> 01:53.840
but of the three billion people on earth. This V-Day, my wife and I celebrated our last

01:53.840 --> 01:59.520
Valentine's Day without a child. You're just going to casually drop

01:59.520 --> 02:03.360
that bomb on the show, by the way. Yeah, well, we already dropped it on

02:03.360 --> 02:07.040
Sawbones. That's where you need to go for your world exclusive baby news.

02:09.600 --> 02:18.640
So we celebrated it by going to the Greenbrier, which is a resort at the eastern edge of West

02:18.640 --> 02:26.480
Virginia. It's 236 years old. Like 30, maybe 50 presidents have stayed there,

02:27.360 --> 02:29.920
and it's got a Cold War bunker in the bottom. Pretty tight.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.280
And a casino. Very romantic. What about you, Trev?

02:33.280 --> 02:38.480
Theresa and I, we spent a day at a Louisville bed and breakfast,

02:38.480 --> 02:44.000
and spent a day exploring Louisville, eating at fancy restaurants, and going to museums.

02:44.000 --> 02:53.600
Oh, Rachel and I spent our Valentine's Day with her, just sort of watching me

02:53.600 --> 02:57.200
writhe on the couch. Sounds sexy so far.

02:58.160 --> 03:05.280
I wasn't writhing with sexual avarice. I wasn't writhing because I was burning with an

03:05.280 --> 03:14.560
invisible sexual flame. An invisible flame. It's because I had, and get out your abacus,

03:15.120 --> 03:22.240
get out your admin machines, I had a sinus infection, and then also some diarrhea,

03:22.240 --> 03:34.160
and then I also had athlete's foot. I had a sinus infection, and I had diarrhea,

03:34.160 --> 03:40.320
and I had athlete's foot. So that was a pretty stellar Valentine's.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.000
Is it possible that they were all side effects of being addicted to love?

03:44.000 --> 03:48.240
I think that may have had something. Maybe it was the kissing oil,

03:48.240 --> 03:52.400
like a side effect of the kissing oil. It was not FDA approved.

03:53.440 --> 03:57.760
Griffin could have gotten ovarian migraines, and the doctor would have found it less surprising.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.560
I did go to the doctor.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.560
More surprising than getting athlete's foot.

04:00.560 --> 04:05.200
I went to the doctor, and she was like, you obviously have a sinus infection.

04:05.200 --> 04:12.800
I was like, yeah, but check this out. Also, dye dye, and plus, check out my toes.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.960
I was like, is there a weird connection? She was like, no, you eat like a dumb shit,

04:18.960 --> 04:21.120
and don't clean your feet in the shower.

04:21.120 --> 04:25.040
You should contact Dr. House, because I'm betting they're connected.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.200
There's got to be a connection.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.040
Let me take a look in his house. Oh, he's just a dirty boy, and he eats stupid food.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.640
I had a thing happen to me the day after Valentine's Day that I wanted to bounce off

04:38.640 --> 04:41.920
of you guys, because this is an advice show. It's an advice podcast from Modern Era.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.760
I'm still not sure if I did the right thing in this situation,

04:45.760 --> 04:48.800
but it was when I was colon rolling on some Sudafed.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.480
I went outside late at night. I was watching Curling.

04:52.480 --> 04:58.560
It was like 1 a.m., and my cat, who was outside, was perched underneath the tree,

04:58.560 --> 05:01.520
and he was looking up in the tree, and there were two giant possums

05:01.520 --> 05:03.760
in the branches of the tree in my neighbor's yard.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.640
I didn't want my cat to get in a fight with these possums and get rabies and die.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.920
My inclination, and keep in mind, I was really, really very high.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.840
I went and I got some rocks from my driveway,

05:19.840 --> 05:25.120
and I started throwing them in the direction of the possums in the tree in my neighbor's yard.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.640
Did you make contact?

05:26.640 --> 05:29.360
I was throwing rocks. I would rather not say. I would rather,

05:30.240 --> 05:34.400
if there are people who are super hardcore PETA folks,

05:35.520 --> 05:39.360
I would rather not divulge whether or not I hit on target,

05:39.360 --> 05:42.000
because you know what? It was dark. I may have or may not have.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.320
Griffin has decided that since his body is slowly decomposing,

05:46.320 --> 05:52.640
he might as well go full old man. Just full, weird, cantankerous old man,

05:52.640 --> 05:54.480
throwing rocks at mammals.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.200
In my neighbor's yard. Yeah. They may have been pet possums.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.560
I don't know. This is fucking Austin.

05:59.360 --> 06:03.520
Griffin, you've got to complete this picture by going over to the neighbor's house

06:03.520 --> 06:05.600
and complaining to them about their possums.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
630. Listen, just wanted to let you know I took care of the possums for you.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.760
Hold on. And then I diarrhea on my bare, grody feet.

06:13.760 --> 06:18.320
Also, I made you some raspberry preserves.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.400
Is this the right thing to do though? Because what am I going to do?

06:22.400 --> 06:24.560
Go get my cat? Nope. Because look up.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.840
Did you try using your words?

06:27.120 --> 06:30.640
I did. You know what the words I said were? This was great.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.480
I walked out and I saw the possum in the tree and I said,

06:32.480 --> 06:35.200
oh no, out loud to myself.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.200
And then I didn't see the second possum until a couple minutes later,

06:39.200 --> 06:41.120
because I saw the other possum hissing upwards.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.200
I was like, what's he hissing? Oh, the second possum.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.160
And I actually said, oh my God. And I turned around and went back in the house.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.720
It snowed real bad here on Valentine's Day proper.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.560
And like, I got into a minor car accident when my car slid into a curb,

06:54.560 --> 06:57.280
but I slid for like 20, 30 feet.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.320
So it was like a really long 20 mile an hour slide.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.360
And the whole time I was sitting there going, oh my, oh my goodness.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.120
Oh, oh gosh. Oh, oh gosh. Oh my gosh.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.440
When you're in the zone, anything can happen, man.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.880
So isn't it weird how when you,

07:14.880 --> 07:17.760
and maybe this isn't the same thing in every part of the country.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.040
In fact, I'm most certain it's not, but like growing up in West Virginia,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.280
we have squirrels, a lot of squirrels everywhere.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.880
Don't see as many of them as you used to. Thanks Al Gore.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.920
Al Gore ground down squirrels to turn them into internet.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.920
He killed them with global warming.

07:33.920 --> 07:40.400
Anyway, it's weird how if I see a squirrel, it's basically like, well, there's a squirrel.

07:40.400 --> 07:46.720
If an animal is 20% bigger, suddenly I'm in fucking wild kingdom.

07:46.720 --> 07:52.640
Like I feel like I'm having a grizzly man style encounter with a wild animal.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.360
And I get terrified.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.960
They're just ferrets with weirder tails.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.600
But like, I don't, I just don't want to look at them.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.120
I just always assume that the possum is looking at me going,

08:01.120 --> 08:02.960
which one of us isn't supposed to be here?

08:04.080 --> 08:05.280
Not infringing on my land.

08:05.280 --> 08:09.360
Yeah. If it's in my house, it knows that it's in the wrong.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.720
But when we're outside, it's a toss up.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.960
Yeah, it's nocturnal.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.400
Let's, let's start.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.280
I feel selfish.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.280
Like I've just been like, I just needed to vent.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.200
Cause like I had a pretty bad two days there.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.880
Two of my three ailments have cleared up by the way.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.800
Sounds like your butt's been doing plenty of venting.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.120
And my face and my fucking.

08:32.240 --> 08:32.720
Every hole.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.520
At just every hole, including the new ones on my feet.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.840
How do you like podcasts?

08:41.280 --> 08:42.720
This is what podcasts are.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.080
How do you feel right now?

08:45.360 --> 08:47.040
This is a journey you've taken yourself on.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.560
Let's answer some questions.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.800
I'm a guy in my mid twenties and I got a haircut the other day.

08:54.880 --> 08:59.120
The barber had me turn sort of, it's an evening recording folks.

08:59.120 --> 08:59.920
We're not used to this.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.280
So things may get a little rippled.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.640
I apologize in advance.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.520
The barber had me turn sort of sideways first, the haircut.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.400
And I didn't want to turn my head while he was working.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.920
That's how you lose an ear.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.360
And lose my attention.

09:11.360 --> 09:17.760
Ironically, when he was done, he turned me back to the mirror and asked what I thought.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.080
Turns out he had cut it way shorter than I wanted.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.720
Obviously I was polite and thanked him and tipped him.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.200
But is there really anything you could do in this situation?

09:25.200 --> 09:27.920
Yeah, like wait 30 days.

09:27.920 --> 09:28.800
Next question.

09:28.800 --> 09:33.040
Like, I guess get a weave?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.160
What do you want us to tell you?

09:34.160 --> 09:35.520
This is fucking physics.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.640
I don't think, okay wait.

09:38.640 --> 09:43.440
I don't think he's asking was there anything I could have done to replace the hair.

09:43.440 --> 09:48.080
I think they're asking is there anything I could have done to tell the dude he did a shit job.

09:48.880 --> 09:54.800
I mean, your problem was going more than 15 seconds where you didn't look, didn't like

09:54.800 --> 10:00.800
fucking fact check the spin job that somebody was doing to your dome while you're getting

10:00.800 --> 10:01.440
a haircut.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.160
You have to keep a constant eye on it.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.360
That's why it's rough as a bespectacled man, though.

10:07.360 --> 10:12.240
Because when they make me take off my glasses to get my hair cut, it's like I'm squitting

10:12.240 --> 10:12.960
so hard.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.000
Hey Travis, 1-800-CONTACTS.

10:14.880 --> 10:20.800
I found my hairdressers hate me because when I say hairdressers, I go to Mastercuts.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.440
The people that work at Mastercuts hate me.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.520
Are you still going to Mastercuts?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.520
My team was stylists.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.720
My team was stylists.

10:28.160 --> 10:33.920
When I go to see a stylist at Mastercuts, what I tell them is that, and that's not to

10:33.920 --> 10:35.680
disparage people who work at Mastercuts.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.520
I thought Sunny was at Fantastic Sam's.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.840
No, Sunny's not at Fantastic Sam's.

10:39.840 --> 10:44.400
And I don't go there because Fantastic Sam's has a hole that kids can put their hair in

10:44.400 --> 10:45.520
and it turns into a toy.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.280
That kind of alchemy is devil worship.

10:49.280 --> 10:55.200
At the risk of running into a trademark violation, home, you don't play that.

10:55.200 --> 10:55.840
So anyway.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.520
You could take that toy home and like cherish it, but you know it's hair.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.880
You know it's a hair toy.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.880
This is a real, that's going to sound really bizarre.

11:04.880 --> 11:05.600
I'm serious.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.800
That's the way this thing works.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.760
You put in some of your hair.

11:08.400 --> 11:13.600
And then a fucking adult like replaces it, like knocks a toy down from the top of it

11:13.600 --> 11:17.520
and you don't, sorry Travis, I don't want to go behind the candelabra here, but you know

11:17.520 --> 11:19.200
it's not like an actual magic thing.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.360
An adult switches the hair for a toy.

11:21.360 --> 11:21.860
Griffin.

11:23.760 --> 11:28.480
I don't, Justin, I don't want to shatter the illusion, but you're a fucking 38 year

11:28.480 --> 11:29.120
old man.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.720
How old do you think our brother is?

11:32.720 --> 11:34.400
This makes a lot of sense in retrospect.

11:35.280 --> 11:41.760
What I do is I tell the hairstylist that they ask what you want, which I used to say like

11:41.760 --> 11:43.680
what do you think I should do?

11:43.680 --> 11:45.200
Because I was just so lost.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.400
But now I tell them just to clean up.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.720
You know, just clean it up so it looks intentional.

11:50.720 --> 11:57.120
And then once they do that, then I say clean it up a bit more and you just stair step them

11:57.120 --> 11:57.840
back from that.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.880
I bet they love you.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.600
Your haircuts take four and a half hours.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.160
I know I said-

12:02.160 --> 12:03.360
Here's some legit advice.

12:03.360 --> 12:03.600
Okay.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.200
Your clippers, right, they have guards on them.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.960
The different guards have different numbers that dictate the length that it will cut your

12:10.960 --> 12:11.600
hair.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.600
Memorize the length you want.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.080
When you go for a haircut and they say, what do you want?

12:16.080 --> 12:20.080
Say, I'd like the sides at a number three and the top at a number five.

12:20.080 --> 12:20.640
A number three?

12:20.640 --> 12:22.560
What's the fucking point if you do a number three?

12:23.280 --> 12:27.680
Well, number three, it trims it up so you don't get, well, I get a little bit curl

12:27.680 --> 12:29.040
past three on the sides.

12:29.040 --> 12:29.280
Okay.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.120
But that just cleans it up and then the five leaves enough to style it.

12:33.120 --> 12:33.440
I see.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.800
I go six all over.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.320
You do six all over?

12:37.520 --> 12:44.160
After they have already messed up your hair though, I think you did the exact right thing

12:44.160 --> 12:55.040
because you've got to instantly make the mental leap that you like it because you have nothing

12:55.040 --> 12:55.680
else.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.920
There's no other options for you.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.680
So telling the person that you did a good job and tipping them is an essential part

13:01.680 --> 13:04.160
of make it because why would you ever be doing that if I didn't like it?

13:04.160 --> 13:04.960
You have to like it.

13:04.960 --> 13:05.840
You have to own it.

13:05.840 --> 13:09.840
I think it's time for us to start bringing the male weave back into fashion.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.680
I love a male weave.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.280
I would love a male weave.

13:13.280 --> 13:22.640
Not all the time because like I live in Texas, so like all of my haircuts are by necessity

13:22.640 --> 13:25.280
just like extremely short for survival sake.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.280
But back in the day, I would get some pretty bad.

13:30.240 --> 13:36.480
When I kicked it at the Happy Hair Boutique, when my non-regular stylist was working,

13:38.160 --> 13:41.040
she would do some pretty whack birds nest shit up there.

13:41.040 --> 13:45.840
And man, I would have appreciated some extensions back then when I was coming up.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.560
So we hope that helps.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.480
You're stuck with it.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.200
See you in 30 days.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.080
You're stuck with it.

13:52.080 --> 13:52.880
Learn to like it.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.280
Next time, you're just looking for a cleanup.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.360
You just want to clean it up and then clean it up more.

14:00.160 --> 14:04.640
Keep your third eye fucking open and watch what they're doing because they'll fuck you.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.000
They'll fuck you and then like you might say like you did a bad job.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.600
But as soon as you walk out the door, they're going to forget all about the bad job they did

14:11.600 --> 14:13.520
and they'll continue terrorizing people.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.400
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

14:15.520 --> 14:17.360
Yahoo is sent in by Drew Davenport.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.240
Thanks, Drew Davenport.

14:19.280 --> 14:22.640
I'm about ready to upgrade Drew Davenport to like platinum status.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.040
He's about to become a triple emerald member.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.560
He's got his 10th stamp.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.000
So his 11th one is free.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.760
His 11th stamp.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.920
The stamps don't mean anything, but here's a free one.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.280
Thank you, Drew.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user Walt who asks,

14:40.080 --> 14:44.720
what do you think of country singer Toby Keith's new restaurant not allowing guns?

14:48.880 --> 14:52.800
From news article, country star actor and restaurateur Toby Keith,

14:52.800 --> 14:54.640
I'll give you one of those,

14:56.320 --> 15:00.320
has sparked a controversy after banning guns from his newly opened eatery in Virginia.

15:00.320 --> 15:05.200
The 52 year old Oklahoma native had a grand opening last week for his newest venture,

15:05.200 --> 15:10.560
Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill in the DC suburb of Woodbridge.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.680
But many of the singer's fans who turned up for the event

15:13.680 --> 15:17.280
were shocked to discover a sign in the window that announced no guns permitted.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.400
Maybe Toby Keith, this is that was from the article.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.000
This is Yahoo Fresh.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.360
Maybe Toby Keith supports guns, but not in his restaurants,

15:25.360 --> 15:27.280
or maybe he doesn't have control over it.

15:30.160 --> 15:30.800
Yes.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.360
Toby Keith done lost control of his fucking restaurant.

15:33.360 --> 15:38.000
But listen, we can all agree that like it's a sovereign earth kind of thing.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.720
When you start into a Toby Keith I love this bar and grill,

15:40.720 --> 15:44.560
you've left American soil and you're in the land of Toby Keith America.

15:44.560 --> 15:44.880
Okay.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.880
And if you're saying if they didn't prohibit guns explicitly on the front door,

15:48.880 --> 15:51.840
it would be like a fucking unreal tournament in there.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.240
People just like as soon as they cross the threshold, just like,

15:54.240 --> 15:54.960
give me a steak.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.960
Give me a steak and some peanuts.

15:58.960 --> 16:03.120
Real talk.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.480
Have either of you ever been in a Toby Keith I love this bar and grill?

16:06.480 --> 16:09.920
I remember when Travis went in one, we were in a Cincinnati Reds game.

16:09.920 --> 16:10.640
Is this real?

16:10.640 --> 16:12.800
This is real.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.960
We were in a Cincinnati Reds game, Travis disappeared.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.360
And when we relocated him,

16:17.360 --> 16:22.240
he informed us that he had just ventured into Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.960
It was part of my like year of new things.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.960
And one day my new thing was I was going to go into a Toby Keith I love this bar and grill.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.000
And it was horrifying.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.440
And so many-

16:31.440 --> 16:37.360
Little did he know it would end in tragedy as gunplay broke out for the 38th consecutive day.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.640
There's no law like that at Cincinnati Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.840
That's just the law West.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.200
I was wondering why you guys didn't react strongly to the name.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.800
And I guess you were fucking-

16:46.800 --> 16:49.840
Yeah, we're pretty, we're pretty, Travis is pretty well inundated.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.680
Do you think Toby Keith strode in there just all angry?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.000
I specifically said guns-

16:56.000 --> 16:56.400
Required.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.040
Guns demanded.

16:57.040 --> 16:57.680
Guns mandatory.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.640
You have to have a gun.

17:04.080 --> 17:06.640
I think he's making a pretty big statement here.

17:06.640 --> 17:15.040
And I've been, I've been wavering on like Toby Keith's constitutional stick-to-it-iveness

17:16.080 --> 17:17.920
for lack of a better term for a while now.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.000
I think, here's what I think.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.800
I'm just going to go down the list of just the things I think, okay?

17:22.800 --> 17:26.080
Uh, the whole Dixie Chicks flare up was a false flag.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.440
Just from, just from the start.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.120
That's just how I feel.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.560
That's just what I believe.

17:30.560 --> 17:35.280
Beer for my horses was also a false flag.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.520
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.480
That's a good tune.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.520
Yeah, that's a movie.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.760
Hold on, but wait, sing, sing the lyrics of that song.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.400
Sing the lyrics of that song backwards though.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.920
Start playing, uh, Wizard of Oz.

17:51.920 --> 18:00.320
Uh, maybe Toby Keith just wants, doesn't want to be challenged if he decides to go in with a gun.

18:00.320 --> 18:04.960
Because you know how it is when you go to a place with a gun and you see somebody else has a gun

18:04.960 --> 18:08.320
and then it's like, well, I guess we have to shoot contest.

18:08.880 --> 18:14.080
And now we have to fight and shoot each other and he just, and maybe times might get tough

18:14.080 --> 18:19.440
and he needs to know there's at least one place he can safely hold up a gun point and rob blind.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.840
I would like to know, like, I just think it would be great

18:23.840 --> 18:29.200
if the other half of that was like guns prohibited, rapiers encouraged.

18:29.200 --> 18:29.360
Yeah.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.480
I'm sorry miss, I'm sorry.

18:32.480 --> 18:36.000
I specifically asked for no chives on my Tato skins.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.880
Um, I demand satisfaction.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.280
Shing!

18:39.920 --> 18:40.960
Um, I guess my-

18:40.960 --> 18:42.400
I meant to sweet up that man.

18:45.200 --> 18:45.760
Hell yeah.

18:45.760 --> 18:49.840
My question is if you, without a gun, how are you supposed to eat pork chops?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.600
And really enjoy them.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.880
You may eat pork chops, but you don't taste pork chops unless you're packing meat.

18:56.880 --> 19:00.960
This is you, knife, fork, cut, cut, cut, cut, dip, maybe you dip in an A1.

19:02.080 --> 19:02.720
Good.

19:02.720 --> 19:07.760
Um, the best way to do it is gun, bullet, bullet, bullet, you load them in a gun

19:07.760 --> 19:10.800
and then you shoot the bot, you shoot, if you can shoot the lip of the plate,

19:10.800 --> 19:13.680
the pork chops on and fling it in the air, it's going to save you a few bullets.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.960
And then you just sort of juggle it up there and then it lands in your mouth.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.600
Ultimately, another good thing to do is to jam as much of the pork chop into

19:21.600 --> 19:26.320
the barrel of the gun as you can and then just take this express train-

19:26.320 --> 19:31.440
Let me tell you, you are going to need a long barreled, maybe a revolver.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.400
Here's the thing.

19:32.400 --> 19:37.760
You want just enough stopping power, but not too much stopping power.

19:38.560 --> 19:42.080
I recently dropped a small fortune on a beautiful designer purse.

19:42.080 --> 19:46.480
The problem is I frequently get asked the question, how much did you pay for it?

19:47.040 --> 19:51.120
Did you guys have any subtle ways of sidestepping this question?

19:51.120 --> 19:54.960
That's from, I'd rather not say in New Brunswick, Canada.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.400
Well, you've come to the right place.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.320
I have-

19:59.600 --> 20:03.040
When I get asked how much I paid for it, I always say more than it was worth.

20:04.240 --> 20:08.480
When I get asked how much I paid for anything, the answer is almost always $9.

20:08.480 --> 20:08.980
$9.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.840
I try really hard not to own anything that costs much money.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.240
What if I fall in-

20:18.240 --> 20:21.680
See, I don't try, but I do.

20:22.320 --> 20:28.320
I don't try very hard to not own things that cost a lot of money.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.240
I just do.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.000
I just, that's just what I-

20:32.640 --> 20:34.880
I try really hard to have things.

20:34.880 --> 20:38.720
It's like that joke, I don't know.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.960
Maybe it's just from our background and sort of how we grew up,

20:43.520 --> 20:50.880
but I almost don't know where people buy expensive things.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.200
I always think that when someone buys an expensive thing,

20:53.200 --> 20:55.440
it's because they didn't have a friend with them going, really?

20:55.440 --> 20:56.240
Oh no, don't do that.

20:56.240 --> 20:56.560
Really?

20:57.200 --> 20:57.840
How much?

20:57.840 --> 20:58.480
I'm sorry, what?

20:58.480 --> 21:05.120
It's weird because as you get older and you're allowed to go whenever stores you want,

21:05.120 --> 21:09.760
you walk into a store and you look at a price tag and it's almost like,

21:09.760 --> 21:12.400
wait a minute, this is the wrong store.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.120
I'm not supposed to be here.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.480
There's five numbers on this shirt.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.040
I'm not supposed to be here.

21:21.040 --> 21:26.160
One of my favorite things to do is to go into fancy boutique clothing emporiums

21:26.160 --> 21:29.680
and challenge myself to look at price tags and keep a stone face.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.880
Just keep like, I'm still considering this face.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.240
Like, how much is this jacket?

21:35.200 --> 21:36.160
I still might buy it.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.440
I don't know.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.080
Wait, I think I already own this jacket in blue.

21:40.080 --> 21:40.640
I'm gonna leave.

21:40.640 --> 21:46.160
But at the same time, I like to have nice stuff.

21:46.160 --> 21:50.800
And I don't like being talked down to by snooty store employees.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.840
Do you remember that one time?

21:51.840 --> 21:56.960
I think it was me and you just went to Brothers of the Year,

21:56.960 --> 22:01.360
went to that fucking protein powder store at the mall

22:01.360 --> 22:03.760
and we're like, we're gonna get our brother Travis some protein powder.

22:03.760 --> 22:07.360
And they're like, this store isn't for you.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.600
The things in this store cost a considerable amount of money.

22:11.600 --> 22:18.320
It's for all of Huntington, West Virginia's extremely wealthy health conscious person.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.080
It's for Steven.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.040
It's for Doug.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.120
Welcome to come on in, Doug.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.160
We just called it that.

22:25.040 --> 22:25.920
Welcome to Doug's.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.080
I love this protein powder.

22:28.080 --> 22:34.560
Because you were like, I guess you wanted to get beefy, I guess.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.880
Maybe this was that summer we had their weight fence

22:36.880 --> 22:41.120
that we found outside of a dollar tree in a dumpster.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.360
I just wish I could be there on the day that you,

22:47.360 --> 22:49.520
young Griffin and young Justin went.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.520
I know what Travis wants.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.680
I remember we walked out of that store so incensed

22:53.680 --> 22:57.040
because and then we had all these conversations in our brain

22:57.040 --> 22:59.920
that we should have had with the come on in, Doug manager.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.800
Like, oh, yeah?

23:00.800 --> 23:03.920
Well, how about this money that I raised working at Blockbuster?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.520
$62.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.760
And the guy's like, yeah, like, yeah.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.320
Like, yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about, little kid.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.560
Do you have a baggie?

23:12.560 --> 23:13.920
I can put off scoop in.

23:13.920 --> 23:18.000
I just don't buy nice things, I guess, is what we're saying.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.120
I know that's a bad answer.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.680
But for the money you spend on that one nice thing,

23:21.680 --> 23:23.280
you could buy 10 OK things.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.760
I guess it's just weird to me that someone would see

23:27.760 --> 23:31.760
something you're clearly proud of that you bought for yourself

23:31.760 --> 23:33.600
and would ask you how much money you pay.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.480
It seems so like unclassy.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.000
The nice thing about owning a lot of things

23:40.000 --> 23:43.360
that don't cost very much money is you can spend a lot of money

23:43.360 --> 23:47.520
is you can always feel free to throw those things at people

23:47.520 --> 23:48.400
to make a point.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.680
If you have expensive things, you can't do that,

23:51.680 --> 23:53.840
unless you're trying to make a point that like,

23:53.840 --> 23:56.400
unless the point is about affluence.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
I love the moment.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.280
One of my favorite moments is when I have a sweet jacket,

24:01.280 --> 24:03.040
like I bought it at thrift store.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.720
So I'm like, oh, my God, I love your jacket.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.440
Where'd you get it?

24:05.440 --> 24:07.120
And you get to say something like, you know what?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.600
Paid three bucks for it.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.040
And they're like, what?

24:11.040 --> 24:13.920
That seems to me like the other way seems like

24:13.920 --> 24:15.280
it's lose, lose.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.200
Like somebody asked how much you pay for that purse

24:17.760 --> 24:19.680
and you say like $1,200.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.720
They're either gonna think, wow, that's way too much money

24:22.720 --> 24:25.440
to pay for a purse or you got ripped off.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.080
I find myself incapable of admitting

24:28.080 --> 24:30.080
how much I spend on anything.

24:30.080 --> 24:33.040
Like I will almost, and I don't know why I do this.

24:33.040 --> 24:36.480
And maybe it's like, I learned it from not wanting

24:36.480 --> 24:38.480
to admit to our parents how much I paid for stuff.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.800
But like, and this was with my money.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.480
So I don't really know why I was hiding.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.200
But whatever I tell people how much something costs,

24:45.200 --> 24:49.600
I tend to always put like a 20 to 30% discount on it.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.800
And there's no reason.

24:50.800 --> 24:51.680
What the fuck are we talking?

24:51.680 --> 24:54.080
Yeah, the answer, obviously lie.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.120
Obviously, oh, yeah.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.160
It was 88% off on Amazon lightning deals.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.000
And then you throw up the shocker

25:02.000 --> 25:05.120
and you make a fucking five minute long uninterrupted

25:05.120 --> 25:07.040
fart noise with your mouth until they walk away.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.560
When I buy stupid shit, I always get to have a fun game

25:10.560 --> 25:12.720
of how much am I gonna tell Teresa this cost?

25:12.720 --> 25:15.600
And it's usually like, honey, it was super clearance.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.680
Yeah, Cindy and I took a tour of the Cold War bunker

25:19.680 --> 25:21.120
at the Greenbrier, right?

25:21.120 --> 25:24.080
And I got the reservations and they told me

25:24.080 --> 25:25.120
how much it was gonna be.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.800
It was $30 per person.

25:26.800 --> 25:27.440
It's a resort.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.080
So everything costs like this dumb amount of money.

25:30.080 --> 25:33.600
And when she said, when I was telling her this,

25:33.600 --> 25:35.600
she said, wait, you have to pay for it?

25:35.600 --> 25:36.880
And I said, yes.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.960
And she said, how much was it?

25:38.960 --> 25:42.400
And I said, it was like $10 per person.

25:43.760 --> 25:44.720
That was it.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.880
And later she saw how much it was.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.360
I don't know why I felt like I had to lie about it.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.920
There was no reason we both wanted to do it.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.840
I just, maybe I want to be seen as thrifty, maybe.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.360
That's an image I'm trying to cultivate.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.240
It's a cool image.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.680
Anytime anybody asks anybody else about the price

26:01.680 --> 26:02.800
that they pay for their clothes,

26:02.800 --> 26:06.960
is it too much to ask them to grab the other person

26:06.960 --> 26:10.480
by the shoulders and hold them completely still

26:10.480 --> 26:13.440
while they sing every word of Macklemore's Thrift Shop

26:13.440 --> 26:14.080
in their face?

26:17.440 --> 26:18.800
Smell like R. Kelly Sheets.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.440
Piss.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.800
Like please, please, please, please, please let me go.

26:22.800 --> 26:23.520
Please let me go.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.560
I'm popping and locking to get the Reebok snapping.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.120
Please.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.000
I'm so sad.

26:28.000 --> 26:28.560
Please.

26:28.560 --> 26:29.360
Piss.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.280
You just sang that one part over and over again.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.400
I think it's the only part you know.

26:33.360 --> 26:33.840
Maybe.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.120
Smell like R. Kelly Sheets.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.120
Piss.

26:37.120 --> 26:41.440
I'm five years old.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.680
Someone can see me piss 50 times.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.720
I laugh every time.

26:45.680 --> 26:48.080
Especially when you say it like a threatening reptile.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.960
Smell like R. Kelly Sheets.

26:50.960 --> 26:51.460
Piss.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.360
Humans.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.960
Look if it sounds like a reptile that should be behind

26:56.960 --> 26:58.240
the Cheshire Cat.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.480
Like the Cheshire Cat's height, man.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.880
Just every few sentences he punctuates it with.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.520
Yeah, and also piss.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.640
That's Ryan Lewis.

27:07.680 --> 27:08.240
Ryan Lewis is a reptile.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.000
Mystery revealed.

27:10.000 --> 27:10.560
He is a-

27:10.560 --> 27:11.040
Fuck stink.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.000
He's a cerulean.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.080
He has been a cerulean.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.040
There's a stink bug on my fucking computer.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.040
What is with your house?

27:20.080 --> 27:22.560
It's this warm weather we're having.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.680
They're getting brave because they're making a run for the outside.

27:25.680 --> 27:29.600
The way stink bugs work is they come to your house when they're cold and they just chill.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.560
They don't do anything.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.360
Oh, that's horrifying.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.160
How can you even-

27:32.160 --> 27:35.280
All they do is chill because they want to stay warm through the winter.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.120
And then when it starts warming up they're like,

27:37.120 --> 27:38.000
well, dip.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.840
Thanks for letting us stay at your pad.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.440
They put on a tiny top hat and they're clean and they get schooled out.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.800
Travis, you're thinking of Joe's apartment again.

27:44.800 --> 27:45.840
That wasn't a documentary.

27:45.840 --> 27:46.560
Oh, sorry.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.680
Sorry, you guys.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.160
Hey, listen.

27:48.160 --> 27:54.480
All this talk about expensive things has got me hungry for a smackeral of money.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.840
So let's go to the money zone.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.040
Why'd you get weird?

27:58.320 --> 27:59.840
I'm rubbing my chest because it is-

27:59.840 --> 28:03.840
He just rubbed kissing oil on his mouth and now everything he says is weird.

28:03.840 --> 28:07.120
I'm not capable of sounding normal while I'm rubbing my chest.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.720
Let's go to the money zone.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.520
I don't like this.

28:19.520 --> 28:25.680
You've probably tried Hulu.com, but Hulu Plus is better than that.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.440
With Hulu Plus you can watch your favorite shows whenever the hell you want.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.720
Because you're a grownup.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.520
Do you want to tell us the shows you watch?

28:36.160 --> 28:37.280
Do you like Jiminy Click?

28:38.080 --> 28:39.040
Probably not on there.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.680
Do you like Jiminy Kimmel?

28:43.440 --> 28:44.960
Jiminy Kimmel's weird brother?

28:44.960 --> 28:45.840
Jiminy Kimmel?

28:46.480 --> 28:47.200
Do you like snow?

28:49.760 --> 28:51.200
You like sharks?

28:56.720 --> 28:58.560
Do you like smoking Percocets?

28:58.560 --> 28:59.520
Because Justin does.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.280
And also Scandal.

29:04.080 --> 29:04.800
That's actually-

29:04.800 --> 29:06.560
Okay, they got those.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.400
They have archived shows.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.720
R. Kelly Sheets.

29:10.720 --> 29:11.520
Oh my god.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.000
Hey, Hulu Plus.

29:14.000 --> 29:14.480
You're welcome.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.200
I just want to see if they're listening.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.280
You can also check out exclusive content.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.560
Can I talk about Lost and Law and Order SVU and Dr. Who and Community?

29:22.560 --> 29:23.840
They're great shows that they have on there.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.800
Archived.

29:24.800 --> 29:25.280
Check them.

29:25.280 --> 29:25.760
Watch them.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.600
And also watch The Wrong Man to Behind the Mask.

29:27.600 --> 29:32.720
They're original programs that you can watch right on there.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.560
It's like not even a problem.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.120
They have ad-free movies.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.320
They got kids content.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.560
And it is $7.99 a month.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.960
Sorry, not $799.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.720
$7.99 a month to-

29:46.720 --> 29:47.440
That's too much.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.120
I'm not going to pay that for at least two weeks.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.560
I don't get paid for two weeks, Griffin.

29:50.560 --> 29:51.760
I can't pay that right now.

29:51.760 --> 29:57.920
Well, I guess the bad news is that you are kind of poor.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.680
I guess the bad news is that you don't have a lot of money.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.120
And that makes me sad for you because you're my brother.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.520
But the good news is that we can give you two weeks free

30:06.160 --> 30:09.440
if you go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.080
All one word.

30:10.720 --> 30:13.520
And you'll get an extended two-week frial.

30:14.160 --> 30:14.800
Frial?

30:14.800 --> 30:15.600
Yeah, that's right.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.960
That's what they call free trials.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.200
Frials.

30:19.200 --> 30:23.920
Go catch your frial on Hulu.com.

30:23.920 --> 30:28.400
Go watch some TV and enjoy it.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.120
Get that frial.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.920
Try for two weeks free and then decide if you want to keep it.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.520
That's such a good deal.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.320
It's a great deal.

30:35.120 --> 30:38.080
Thank you, Hulu, for giving us money to just be-

30:38.080 --> 30:40.160
HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

30:40.160 --> 30:40.800
Thank you.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.520
Here's another great product that we're perfect to advertise.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.520
We may be after Hulu sues us out of house and home

30:47.520 --> 30:50.160
for stealing their fucking money for bullshit.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.680
Listen, we've all had legal troubles.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.400
All of us.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.920
Sometimes David Comey's busy.

30:56.560 --> 31:01.280
Sometimes David Comey, the lawyer who rocks, is busy.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.800
Because we fucking give him a lot of free airtime here.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.440
I'm a bim-bam.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.080
So don't even worry about that quack.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.520
Because we got legal zoom.

31:09.520 --> 31:09.760
It turns you into-

31:09.760 --> 31:10.480
That was liable.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.240
So now we're definitely going to need legal zoom.

31:13.200 --> 31:16.880
Legal zoom is, it makes you a lawyer, basically.

31:16.880 --> 31:22.080
You can incorporate or form an LLC with a simple questionnaire.

31:22.080 --> 31:26.160
And it's just $99, which seems like to create a business

31:26.160 --> 31:29.760
for yourself that like something you pass on to your children.

31:29.760 --> 31:35.600
For $99, you don't want to make a business for your children to have?

31:36.160 --> 31:38.640
Real talk, should we fucking do this?

31:39.520 --> 31:40.960
Should we have a business?

31:40.960 --> 31:42.000
I think we probably should.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.360
I think we probably should have incorporated years ago.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.000
We could become my brother, my brother, and me incorporated.

31:46.000 --> 31:46.240
Yeah.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.680
Or we could just like protect our shit.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.320
So people can't like fucking steal it all the time.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.920
These kids incorporated taken.

31:53.360 --> 31:58.640
You can also create a will starting at just $69 or a living trust.

31:58.640 --> 32:03.200
That's like a will for people who refuse to die quickly and easily

32:03.200 --> 32:05.600
and get peace of mind and also protection.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.840
Now listen, legal zoom is not a law firm,

32:07.840 --> 32:10.800
but they can connect you with a third party attorney

32:10.800 --> 32:13.280
and they can provide you with self-help services.

32:13.280 --> 32:18.160
Which is something I would be interested in because lawyers weird me out.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.400
And I don't like people.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.760
And having just like a person there in between me and a lawyer would be great.

32:23.760 --> 32:26.160
I'm supposed to be closing on a house here in a few weeks

32:26.160 --> 32:28.240
and like there will be two to three lawyers in the room

32:28.240 --> 32:30.480
and I'm fucking terrified.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.640
I might request that one of them be David Comey.

32:32.640 --> 32:36.320
I think he's like an accidents guy, but I don't know.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.360
Maybe he diversified.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.360
You can get more savings.

32:39.360 --> 32:44.000
You just type my brother into the referral box at the checkout.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.800
I know this stuff isn't necessarily fun to think about.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.000
What, living wills?

32:48.000 --> 32:48.640
Are you sure?

32:49.760 --> 32:50.080
What?

32:50.640 --> 32:51.520
Justin.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.960
You're trying to get your laugh on.

32:52.960 --> 32:53.920
I get it.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.200
But right now is the time to make a business or a will.

32:58.800 --> 33:04.000
Make a business and then put in the will that the business goes to your kids

33:04.000 --> 33:06.720
and then figure out what you're going to do in your business

33:06.720 --> 33:08.720
because you don't have any special skills or anything.

33:08.720 --> 33:15.200
But you do have some help on your legal documents from LegalZoom.com.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.280
Remember to use the discount code MYBROTHER at referral.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.080
This might be fun too.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.960
This might be like a fun, I'm doing like a little arm dance

33:20.960 --> 33:22.400
because I'm so excited about this idea.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.480
Like a fun like podcast contest.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.240
You know how people do that sometimes?

33:26.240 --> 33:26.720
Uh-huh.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.320
How crazy can your will be?

33:28.320 --> 33:29.440
Name us and your will.

33:30.320 --> 33:31.120
Oh, okay.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.240
You don't have to leave us like-

33:32.240 --> 33:33.360
Like living will.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.560
Think of all the demands you could make.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.240
Don't leave us like a bunch of stuff.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.240
Maybe just like your pogs collection or something like that.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.440
But like it's like-

33:39.440 --> 33:43.040
I want to get a call from a lawyer in like 2080

33:43.040 --> 33:44.400
because none of you are going to die anytime soon.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.160
It's like a podcast, like a postcard.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.840
Like you guys send us postcards and that's great.

33:47.840 --> 33:53.440
But when you send us like tell my bim bam sup and that's in your will,

33:53.440 --> 33:56.000
that's like a postcard that you can only send once.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.280
It would be terrific if you could leave in your will like a haunted house

33:59.280 --> 34:00.720
but we have to spend the night there.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.520
I love it.

34:01.520 --> 34:02.400
Yes, please.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.440
I just assume that's a real thing and I want that.

34:05.440 --> 34:09.840
So I got a message for Tom from Pete and Joe and John.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.480
Big things on the Tom front, guys.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.440
Here's your Tom update.

34:13.440 --> 34:15.120
Do do do do do do do do do.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.160
Tom update.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.920
Tom, this is a commercial for you.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.480
You got a new job, a new beard, and you're running.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.200
Fortunately, you're so focused on moving 20 forward

34:23.200 --> 34:26.000
that you forgot to look 20 left and you were hit by IKEA.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.720
It's not funny.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.920
It's not funny.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.760
Hey, it's not funny.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.800
Stop laughing.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.880
Stop laughing, Tom.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.120
So as your leg heals, just know that we love you

34:37.120 --> 34:39.680
and maybe someday we'll get to use the Jumbotron

34:39.680 --> 34:42.480
for something other than broken legs and cancer condolences.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.200
Oh boy, oh boy.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.480
Tom, how's your week?

34:45.280 --> 34:46.000
Oh man.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.040
Tom, I hope you feel better, buddy.

34:47.040 --> 34:47.840
Tom, feel better.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.880
At least it was a Kia.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.440
It's like the wimpiest car in the whole world.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.200
I drive a Kia.

34:53.200 --> 34:56.160
Got a message for Chris Cook from Devin Cook.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.320
And Devin says, thank you for being an amazing partner.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.920
I love you more every day.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.920
My question for you, will you be my Valentine?

35:05.920 --> 35:08.480
P.S. Happy Valentine's brothers.

35:08.480 --> 35:13.040
Also to Chris, totes sorry about the timing.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.520
Well, no, we can't apologize for this shit anymore.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.120
What did we tell you?

35:17.760 --> 35:18.560
What did we say?

35:18.560 --> 35:21.840
I don't want to get like all hyphy in your face,

35:21.840 --> 35:24.640
but we mean what we say when we say that we're fuck ups.

35:25.280 --> 35:29.840
I'm gonna turn a little more positive and say, I like this.

35:29.840 --> 35:34.880
I hope it becomes a trend of people buying money zones

35:34.880 --> 35:37.520
and then sneaking in secret messages to us

35:38.640 --> 35:40.800
in messages to their loved ones.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.240
Happy birthday, dad.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.880
Also, Travis, I dig the mustache you're rocking right now.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.760
You're doing it great.

35:45.760 --> 35:46.960
It is working for you.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.080
Also, you're in my will.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.640
I'll leave you my mustache if you leave me your mustache.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.760
We're mustache Will brothers.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.120
Uh, so, uh, that's very sweet, Devin and Chris.

35:59.120 --> 36:03.440
And I hope you all have a wonderful Valentine's Day together.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.600
It's sort of in love.

36:05.600 --> 36:05.840
What is it?

36:05.840 --> 36:07.360
A happy, I hope you had a great.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.720
Next year, um, have a happy flag day.

36:10.720 --> 36:11.520
You too.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.400
I'm Carrie Poppy.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.320
I'm Ross Botcher and we make a show.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.680
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

36:15.680 --> 36:21.520
No, we investigate fringe science, spirituality, religious groups, alternative therapies.

36:21.520 --> 36:24.400
We put ourselves through a lot of uncomfortable situations.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.000
So that you don't have to.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.200
Because really, why would you?

36:27.200 --> 36:31.360
For example, I watched a tube be inserted into Ross's anus.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.760
That's true, but it sounds terrible out of context.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.880
We've tried penis and breast enlargement pills.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.280
We spent six months undercover becoming Mormons.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.040
We hung out with the 9-11 truthers.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.880
The UFO cult, the Raelians.

36:42.880 --> 36:43.760
And we're going to do more.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.320
It's one of the newest shows on Maximumfun.org.

36:50.640 --> 36:51.360
Here's a yahoo.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.880
Uh, hit me.

36:52.880 --> 36:53.360
I'm ready.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.200
This yahoo was sent in by Elliot Nevels.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.000
Thanks, Elliot.

36:56.000 --> 37:04.720
It's by yahoo answers user saving hope who asks, can I adopt an 18-year-old if I'm 18 years old?

37:08.720 --> 37:09.280
Wait.

37:09.280 --> 37:13.200
Can I adopt an 18-year-old if I'm 18-year-old?

37:14.400 --> 37:17.280
I'm rich and want a best friend who's in my care.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.080
I have, I have a fiancee?

37:20.960 --> 37:21.600
It's in question.

37:21.600 --> 37:25.920
It's in question, so I think they do have a fiancee and they're just-

37:25.920 --> 37:27.200
Still waiting on an answer.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.360
No, I think they're just wondering if that sweetens the pot.

37:31.200 --> 37:36.000
It's hard out there for a single parent of a teenager and also the single parent is a teenager.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.720
If they have a fiancee that might, you know, fucking grease the wheels.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.880
It's a fucking shame how this system works.

37:40.880 --> 37:41.760
It's so corrupt.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.000
You got to grease the wheel somewhere.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.240
It's a very greasy system, but I think having a fiancee might help this along.

37:48.240 --> 37:53.120
I hope they, I hope they trademark this Yahoo answer before Seth Rogen and James Franco listen

37:53.120 --> 37:56.320
to our podcast because if not, this is their next film.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.200
I don't think-

37:59.120 --> 38:00.640
You said you wanted to adopt a kid.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.880
It turned out all we had was this 40-year-old man.

38:03.760 --> 38:04.800
Also, you're 18.

38:05.920 --> 38:06.960
It's the new hit comedy.

38:06.960 --> 38:07.680
Who's the dad?

38:11.120 --> 38:13.520
Can an 18-year-old adopt an 18-year-old?

38:13.520 --> 38:14.320
I don't think so.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.080
Is that 18-year-old rich or poor?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.160
Can you adopt an 18-year-old at all?

38:18.960 --> 38:21.600
I mean, this is basically the plot of the OC, right?

38:21.600 --> 38:25.040
Peter Gallagher is much, much, Peter Gallagher is fucking Nosferatu.

38:25.040 --> 38:28.160
I thought, I thought Seth adopted Ryan.

38:28.160 --> 38:29.440
No, no, no.

38:29.440 --> 38:29.920
He didn't.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.440
Stop trying to spread these falsehoods.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.640
I'm almost positive Seth did.

38:34.640 --> 38:41.520
Please do not besmirch the amazing act of love and faith that Sandy and Kirsten Cohen

38:41.520 --> 38:43.600
made in adopting Ryan Atwood.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.440
I won't have it on this podcast.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.760
There's, well, we could joke about a lot of things here.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.120
I'm sorry, I crossed the line.

38:49.120 --> 38:54.240
I can't, can we reframe this to make it an actual thinker?

38:54.240 --> 38:54.800
Can we do what?

38:54.800 --> 38:55.680
Can we reframe this?

38:56.560 --> 38:57.120
Okay.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.360
Can an 18-year-old adopt a 17-year-old?

39:00.160 --> 39:04.400
Because I don't think an 18-year-old, I'm almost certain an 18-year-old can't adopt

39:04.400 --> 39:05.200
an 18-year-old.

39:05.920 --> 39:09.040
I think a 17-year-old, I think you might have a case there.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.400
How hard is it to adopt somebody?

39:12.400 --> 39:13.280
Pretty fucking easy.

39:14.240 --> 39:14.560
Yeah.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.840
It's just, you just ask them.

39:15.840 --> 39:20.320
If they say yes, you can catch them under the maypole with a sugar lasso.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.480
That's the way it works.

39:24.480 --> 39:28.480
And then on Sadie Hawkins Day, all the 17-year-olds chase the 18-year-olds,

39:28.480 --> 39:30.400
whichever ones they touch, adopt them.

39:30.400 --> 39:30.720
Yeah.

39:30.720 --> 39:34.160
I gigged this frog and spun around three times and now you're my kid.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.640
And also this frog's my kid.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.760
I sure do have a lot to learn about this crazy country of ours.

39:39.760 --> 39:44.240
That's how it works in Meepos, you see.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.080
So Valky was confused.

39:46.080 --> 39:54.320
I don't think the adoption authorities would give the stamp on this particular plan.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.920
Have you thought about legal Zoom?

39:59.520 --> 40:01.360
18-year-old looking to adopt a 17-year-old?

40:01.360 --> 40:01.920
Yeah, that sounds good.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.120
Yeah, I will do that.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.600
Don't forget my brother, coupon code.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.120
I'm Brad.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.080
This is my boy, Chad.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.000
Hey, what's up?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.120
His dad's kind of a dick.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.760
You want him to go to the Stone Temple Pilots concert?

40:15.760 --> 40:17.680
And I couldn't think of a better-

40:17.680 --> 40:20.000
Wowsers, Bowser's, Stone Temple Pilots.

40:20.560 --> 40:21.760
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.920
Yeah, his dad's kind of a dick.

40:23.920 --> 40:27.440
Listen, I reached one pocket and I came out with Stone Temple Pilots.

40:27.440 --> 40:28.240
I just got a place.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.760
It's a one bed behind the Citgo, but I don't know.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.040
I think I'd be a pretty cool dad.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.880
I know I'm just a lunch lady.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.480
But we really want to go to warp tour.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.360
I got another question for you.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.400
Love this idea, though.

40:46.400 --> 40:49.120
Please do this thing and then call me and let me know how it worked.

40:49.840 --> 40:50.800
That's how it goes.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.000
Don't forget to use legal Zoom.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.520
I'm turning 30 soon and I'm having a party.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.400
It was going to be a joint party.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.720
Mmm, weed smoking.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.720
With my roommate since he turns 30 four days later.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.520
At 430.

41:08.480 --> 41:08.960
What's up?

41:13.120 --> 41:13.840
That's nothing.

41:15.520 --> 41:19.120
It's that one of my friends is my roommate's ex.

41:19.120 --> 41:21.840
They can't be in the same room as each other without a scene.

41:21.840 --> 41:25.360
It'll be especially bad if my roommate brings his newly pregnant fiancee.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.640
I'm getting confused, guys.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.280
Help me.

41:29.280 --> 41:29.840
Okay, you ready?

41:30.400 --> 41:32.400
If I ask my friend not to come, she'll be devastated.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.360
What do I do?

41:33.360 --> 41:36.560
Should I have the party for myself and keep my roommate away?

41:36.560 --> 41:38.000
Or tell my friend not to come?

41:38.800 --> 41:39.440
Please help.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.440
That's from It Still Feels Like High School at 30.

41:41.440 --> 41:45.360
I don't know if it's that we're getting better at this or the questions are getting easier.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.400
This is so easy.

41:46.400 --> 41:46.960
Quick, draw it.

41:48.480 --> 41:52.240
Tell your friend not to come because you live with your fucking roommate and it's his house.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.120
And his birthday.

41:53.840 --> 41:54.960
And his birthday.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.800
Your friend will be devastated.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.640
That's the thing that's the craziest in this quest.

41:58.640 --> 42:01.680
I get there being some drama, I mean.

42:01.680 --> 42:02.640
I fucking get it.

42:02.640 --> 42:06.000
Like, it exists in every friend group that's big enough that's been around long enough.

42:06.000 --> 42:06.720
I fucking get it.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.760
But, like, I can't come to this one party.

42:10.320 --> 42:14.560
Can't you just say to your friend, like, hey, listen, it's his birthday and it'll make things

42:14.560 --> 42:15.360
awkward.

42:15.360 --> 42:20.000
We can, like, have lunch sometime, but I just don't think it's a good idea for you to come.

42:21.120 --> 42:23.440
Or let me hit you with this.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.200
Two parties.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.480
Costume party.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.440
Everybody wears masks.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.040
That's so much better than two parties.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.560
Everybody wears a mask.

42:30.560 --> 42:31.440
Nobody's allowed to talk.

42:31.440 --> 42:34.080
Sit in silence and stare at each other and smoke that herb.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.120
Smoke that sweet herb.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.640
Don't give it to the pregnant lady.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.000
What are you doing?

42:38.000 --> 42:38.560
I don't...

42:40.000 --> 42:41.280
There's nothing you can do.

42:41.280 --> 42:47.360
Like, once you have this shit in your group, the only thing you can do is fucking select

42:47.360 --> 42:49.040
who gets to go to what, right?

42:49.040 --> 42:52.240
Or just tell both of them and then they can decide for themselves.

42:52.240 --> 42:55.760
The fact of the matter is, is, like, the next day...

42:55.760 --> 43:01.920
Okay, one, are you really gonna tell your roommate who it was going to be a joint birthday

43:01.920 --> 43:04.240
celebration with, like, hey, you can't come?

43:04.240 --> 43:05.040
That's crazy.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.760
So, instead, I've invited your ex-girlfriend.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.280
That's completely out of your hands.

43:09.840 --> 43:10.720
This is the thing, though.

43:10.720 --> 43:18.000
Like, I think when people decide to leave a relationship in a point that it's this sort

43:18.000 --> 43:23.280
of strained and cantankerous, like, they have to accept that they're gonna miss out on some

43:23.280 --> 43:23.520
stuff.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.120
I mean, this is why you decide to squash-

43:25.120 --> 43:27.040
And you have to side with the person you live with.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.680
Yeah, this is why you decide to squash beeps.

43:29.680 --> 43:36.320
Like, your friend has to understand that, like, I mean, it's part of the risk of getting

43:36.320 --> 43:37.520
together and breaking up everything.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.040
Like, it's just collateral damage.

43:39.040 --> 43:44.240
But in this case, and they are forcing you to choose by not being cool with each other.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.440
They're forcing you to choose.

43:45.440 --> 43:48.960
And since it's your roommate's house and your roommate's birthday, this is not a tough one.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.640
It's unfortunate, but, like, if your friend cares that much, tell her to squash the beef

43:52.640 --> 43:53.600
with your roommate.

43:53.600 --> 43:58.960
You have to, seriously, let this be a blanket statement for questions like these.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.560
Because it really is the best solution.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.560
Because we've all, like, had to deal with this shit before.

44:04.560 --> 44:10.800
It's not fair for you to spend, like, any time, like, worrying about this and deliberating

44:10.800 --> 44:11.920
who gets to do what.

44:11.920 --> 44:16.880
Like, you're in some sort of fucked up custody battle with, like, people you didn't marry

44:16.880 --> 44:18.160
and aren't related to.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.200
Have you thought about legal zoom?

44:19.200 --> 44:20.400
Have you thought about legal zoom?

44:20.400 --> 44:20.800
A.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.200
B.

44:21.200 --> 44:24.640
If legal zoom doesn't fall through for you, which, like, why do we even have an option?

44:24.640 --> 44:24.800
B.

44:24.800 --> 44:29.680
You need to put the ball in their court, because they're fucking 30 years old, and, like, they

44:29.680 --> 44:32.000
should be adult enough to figure this out on their own.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.200
So you say, like, you can either come and be cool, or you cannot come.

44:37.200 --> 44:44.160
Like, it just makes me tired to, like, have to figure out who gets to come to which thing.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.800
Like, let me get out my Garfield calendar.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.000
Oh, nope, it's a Greg day.

44:48.000 --> 44:48.000
A.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.720
We'll make the decision for you, if that's what you want.

44:50.720 --> 44:51.920
You can put them on the line.

44:51.920 --> 44:52.720
We'll break it to them.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.960
Gentle, but this is the right thing.

44:54.960 --> 44:59.840
Hold on, if I may real quick butt into your life a little bit, your roommate has been

44:59.840 --> 45:03.280
broken up with this person long enough to, like, have a fiance.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.720
They need to fucking squash this beef already.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.080
This beef is soiled.

45:08.080 --> 45:08.800
Maybe.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.080
I meant to say spoiled.

45:10.080 --> 45:13.600
Maybe it's a fly-by-night, super fast developing baby embryo.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.200
Oh, one of those super babies.

45:15.200 --> 45:16.880
No, there's nothing that's tied to-

45:16.880 --> 45:18.960
It's an inside, it's an inside, Jack.

45:18.960 --> 45:22.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.120
Nothing starts a fight between exes like Jack.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.160
Did you cheat on me?

45:26.160 --> 45:27.360
She's eight months pregnant.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.120
We've only been broken up for one month.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.280
Nah, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.320
Former baby.

45:32.320 --> 45:33.200
Check it.

45:33.200 --> 45:33.920
Inside Jack.

45:35.920 --> 45:36.240
Check it.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.680
She's got a little Jack in there, trust me.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.520
It's been a Jack attack.

45:39.520 --> 45:40.240
It's a Jack attack.

45:40.240 --> 45:40.640
Did you ever see that-

45:40.640 --> 45:41.120
Jack in the Mood.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.680
You ever see that, you ever see that movie, Jack?

45:43.680 --> 45:44.320
Yeah?

45:44.320 --> 45:46.880
You ever see that movie, Dead Poets Society?

45:47.440 --> 45:48.800
It's a pretty good movie, don't you think?

45:49.520 --> 45:50.880
I'm glad we could talk like this again.

45:50.880 --> 45:51.840
I miss these talks.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.120
I'm glad you could come to this party.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.320
At least you're not being a shithead.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.160
For once.

45:57.360 --> 45:58.400
What that's supposed to mean.

45:59.120 --> 45:59.840
Oh, great.

45:59.840 --> 46:00.720
And then you get-

46:00.720 --> 46:03.280
Hey, speaking of adult parties, this Yahoo was sent in by Evan Quell.

46:03.280 --> 46:03.680
Thanks, Evan.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Trixie Bell, who asks,

46:07.120 --> 46:11.920
would grownups, late 20s and early 30s, enjoy a sleepover pajama party?

46:12.560 --> 46:12.960
Yes.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.640
I'm thinking about hosting one.

46:14.640 --> 46:15.360
That's it.

46:15.360 --> 46:15.760
Yes.

46:16.960 --> 46:17.360
Okay.

46:17.360 --> 46:21.440
Like, this isn't even a funny, I had this thought the other day of like,

46:21.440 --> 46:24.800
why don't we do, like, I have, like, why don't we do this?

46:24.800 --> 46:29.840
I mean, we do, but like, it's not like an on-purpose sleepover most of the time.

46:29.840 --> 46:30.340
Right.

46:31.040 --> 46:31.760
True.

46:31.760 --> 46:35.680
But I've got friends that I enjoy hanging out with and that I would like to have waffles with.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.000
Yeah.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.920
Why can't, like, we have a sleepover and everybody, we, you know, we just hang out?

46:40.640 --> 46:42.080
Can I tell you the problem with this?

46:42.080 --> 46:47.840
And I, this has been my problem with every party I've been to since I was 18,

46:47.840 --> 46:51.440
is that no one will just go to sleep at a decent hour.

46:51.440 --> 46:57.440
It is impossible to get 20-somethings to just turn off the lights at midnight and get some rest

46:57.440 --> 47:00.160
so we can all have a great, well-rested day.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.720
But no one wants to think that far ahead, it's infuriating.

47:02.720 --> 47:07.440
Let me jump, let me jump back and say, caveat to this, it would have to happen at my house

47:07.440 --> 47:10.320
and everybody would have to be in a separate room from my bedroom

47:10.320 --> 47:13.360
so that when it was time for me to go to bed, I could just leave.

47:13.360 --> 47:16.320
Okay, but you're talking about a hotel at the, that's not a party, Travis, here.

47:16.320 --> 47:19.520
No, like, they could sleep in my living room when they were ready,

47:19.520 --> 47:20.720
but they gotta keep it the fuck down so they can go to bed at midnight.

47:20.720 --> 47:24.800
You're talking about an amateur bed and breakfast, not a party at that point.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.080
That's true.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.240
I want to open a bed and breakfast.

47:28.240 --> 47:31.040
Okay, so let's talk about that, then, and not, let's just, like,

47:31.040 --> 47:35.600
totally jump ship on this question and talk about your new amateur bed and breakfast.

47:35.600 --> 47:39.040
Is there any way that in the morning the guests could make breakfast for me?

47:39.040 --> 47:39.360
Okay.

47:40.720 --> 47:44.080
Should head over to legalsoon.com, get those documents going.

47:44.080 --> 47:46.880
I'm telling you, this is the best new partnership.

47:46.880 --> 47:49.920
And I mean, you also have to think about all the fucking.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.040
I'm sorry, what?

47:53.040 --> 47:54.080
Sorry, what?

47:54.080 --> 47:55.200
Gotta think about the fucking.

47:56.160 --> 48:01.520
Guys, this party, let's talk about Travis's amateur bed and breakfast party.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.600
Okay, midnight, lights out, everybody.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.120
Try to sleep.

48:05.120 --> 48:08.000
Try to sleep over the sounds of chopping and screwing in the other room.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.840
Like in a big, writhing pile?

48:11.840 --> 48:18.640
I'm talking about fucking 20 foot Marshall stacks worth of DBs of gooshin.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.640
I don't like this bed and breakfast anymore.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.760
I'm going to file a very negative review on TripAdvisor.

48:28.560 --> 48:29.360
Unless that's your thing.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.600
The waffles were great.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.880
The waffles, excellent.

48:32.880 --> 48:33.680
The gooshin, not so much.

48:33.680 --> 48:34.640
Not so terrific.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.240
Unless we're talking about the gooshin of the syrup.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.600
That was pretty good.

48:37.600 --> 48:41.360
But wait, we are not talking about that specific gooshin.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.840
My girlfriend and I are planning to move from Kentucky to Portland, Oregon.

48:49.840 --> 48:55.760
However, her grandmother has frequently told us she would like us to stay in Kentucky.

48:55.760 --> 49:00.000
We are afraid that telling her grandmother will result in some tension and arguments.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.280
The move is still a few months away.

49:01.280 --> 49:05.200
Should we tell her now and get it over with or wait till the moving truck is packed and

49:05.200 --> 49:06.480
yell peace out the window?

49:06.480 --> 49:08.160
That's from feeling sucky in Kentucky.

49:11.600 --> 49:13.280
How often do you see this grandmother?

49:15.200 --> 49:15.920
How much longer?

49:15.920 --> 49:17.920
No, stop it, stop it, stop it.

49:17.920 --> 49:19.680
No, have you thought about legal zoom?

49:19.680 --> 49:19.920
Okay.

49:22.560 --> 49:26.720
I'm just saying, like, if you only see her three times a year, you might be able to fly

49:26.720 --> 49:28.080
under the radar with this one.

49:29.520 --> 49:33.360
Are you saying you can just dip and she won't notice?

49:33.360 --> 49:37.600
I'm saying that, like, if you only see her, like, Memorial Day, Thanksgiving and, like,

49:37.600 --> 49:41.840
Christmas, you just continue doing that.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.640
Well, then, the next time you see him, you will have that Portland smell on you.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.000
That's true.

49:46.800 --> 49:47.360
And you won't-

49:47.360 --> 49:48.560
Are you wearing him?

49:49.760 --> 49:50.800
I've never been to Portland.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.720
That was a gross stereotype.

49:52.720 --> 49:53.360
I apologize.

49:53.360 --> 49:55.920
You guys love coffee and it rains all the time.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.640
I'm so sorry.

49:56.640 --> 49:57.600
I can't stop.

49:57.600 --> 49:58.960
I got Seattle, right?

49:58.960 --> 49:59.440
What?

49:59.440 --> 50:00.000
No, no, no.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.920
The place with all the coffee and it's really grungy.

50:04.480 --> 50:05.360
And Frasier.

50:05.360 --> 50:06.320
And Space Needle.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.040
And Bumbershoot.

50:07.040 --> 50:08.880
Yeah, yeah, you know.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.320
Twilight, where Twilight was filmed.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.440
Seahawks.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.040
Are they not the same place?

50:15.920 --> 50:17.040
They're an annex.

50:18.080 --> 50:19.600
They're recently incorporated.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.200
You gotta-

50:21.920 --> 50:24.320
Why does your grandmother give a fuck where you live?

50:25.280 --> 50:27.120
No, no, no, no, no.

50:27.120 --> 50:31.120
I can assume your grandmother, because I'm assuming you're an adult,

50:31.120 --> 50:33.280
that your grandmother's older than 12.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.160
Why doesn't she fucking understand that you're an adult?

50:36.160 --> 50:38.000
You get to make your life decisions.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.840
And you can do what you will.

50:40.560 --> 50:43.520
If she's not happy for you, she's not really your grandmother.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.400
You thought about that?

50:44.400 --> 50:47.840
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

50:47.840 --> 50:52.560
The question asker only says that grandmama said she would like them to stay.

50:52.560 --> 50:58.000
Yeah, because she's being a selfish bitch.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.600
I'm saying grandma's not saying, like, if you move out, you're dead to me.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.560
She's saying, like, it would be great if I could continue to see you,

51:04.560 --> 51:06.080
but I understand that you have to live your own life.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.960
Yeah, that is, thanks for the guilt trip, James.

51:09.600 --> 51:13.760
Like, fucking let me fly my own freak flag in Portland.

51:13.760 --> 51:14.800
I completely understand.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.800
I'm just saying I would like it if you stayed in Kentucky,

51:16.800 --> 51:17.760
because I like seeing you.

51:17.760 --> 51:19.440
Yeah, you know what I would appreciate?

51:19.440 --> 51:20.240
Oh, grandma.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.280
Oh, thanks for the pie.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.920
Why don't you get off my jock for like a second?

51:27.440 --> 51:29.040
Here's something you could try.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.360
Take her with you.

51:31.360 --> 51:34.240
Now hear me out.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.600
Against her will, Justin?

51:35.600 --> 51:36.480
That seems harsh.

51:37.520 --> 51:40.960
Put her in the back seat, put a blindfold on her,

51:40.960 --> 51:44.640
give her some Dramamine until she's out, drive to Seattle,

51:46.320 --> 51:49.520
buy her a house near your house, but not too close.

51:49.520 --> 51:52.480
Find her a job, because you just bought two houses.

51:54.080 --> 51:55.120
You're gonna need some income.

51:57.440 --> 52:00.240
Oh, buy her a house that looks exactly like her house in Kentucky,

52:00.240 --> 52:01.840
decorated exactly the same way.

52:01.840 --> 52:04.160
Move all of her friends there, buy them houses too.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.280
Import some black bears.

52:06.640 --> 52:10.480
Note that this plan is only viable for Jaden Smith,

52:10.480 --> 52:12.560
but Jaden, if you're listening.

52:13.360 --> 52:14.880
Oh, Truman, show it.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.400
So you're gonna build a tiny-

52:16.400 --> 52:17.600
Okay, wait, hold on.

52:17.600 --> 52:18.960
Let me think through the logistics.

52:18.960 --> 52:21.040
You're gonna have to build a dome, I think around-

52:21.040 --> 52:27.840
With this fucking woman's Appalachian wisdom and holler smarts,

52:27.840 --> 52:30.480
you're telling me she wouldn't see through that ruse in a minute?

52:31.280 --> 52:32.640
Oh yeah, I see.

52:32.640 --> 52:35.040
You think I just fell off the fucking turnip truck?

52:35.040 --> 52:37.440
That's a camera, that's a camera, that's a camera.

52:39.840 --> 52:43.760
The first time that she starts going out to the forage for Crick Muffins,

52:43.760 --> 52:46.800
and she can't find any, she's gonna know something's going on.

52:46.800 --> 52:50.000
You're gonna have to make her afraid of water, if I remember correctly.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.400
Let me just look at any grass.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.360
That's not blue.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.320
Bye, fuckers.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.040
Not again, you fucks.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.400
I gotta go to legal zoom and update my documents.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.920
I'm gonna Milo and Otis this thing all the way home.

53:04.480 --> 53:06.800
I want an incredible journey my way back to Kentucky.

53:06.800 --> 53:09.120
I've got spry Appalachian bones.

53:09.680 --> 53:14.000
Two dogs, a cat, and a grandma make their way majestically across this land.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.280
You'll never guess which one dies.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.880
What happens next will shock you.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.280
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.000
It's an advice show for you.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.560
These 12 photos will convince you never to move your grandmother.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.840
Never to kidnap your grandmother and then build a secret television

53:27.840 --> 53:30.960
installation base around her and make her think she's still in Kentucky,

53:30.960 --> 53:33.840
but she won't because she's got rural smarts.

53:36.400 --> 53:38.480
A lot of SEO optimization in that headline.

53:40.240 --> 53:42.960
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

53:42.960 --> 53:46.480

54:17.280 --> 54:19.440
Hope that it was worth it.

54:20.720 --> 54:21.920
Worth the wait, as they say.

54:22.480 --> 54:24.400
If it's ever, I don't know.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.320
They're God's floppiest mistake.

55:18.720 --> 55:21.600
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinters for the use of our theme song

55:21.600 --> 55:23.600

55:24.400 --> 55:31.520
John Roderick's going to be a speaker, presenter at BoatParty.biz this year.

55:31.520 --> 55:33.920
He's also the closest they have to an onboard physician.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.680

55:35.680 --> 55:38.720
