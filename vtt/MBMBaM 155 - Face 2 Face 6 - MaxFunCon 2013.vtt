The McElroy Brothers

00:32.260 --> 00:36.260
Don't give it to ya. Fuck wait for you to get it on your own.

00:36.260 --> 00:38.260
The McElroy Brothers

00:38.260 --> 00:40.260

00:40.260 --> 00:42.260

Go hard getting busy with it

00:44.260 --> 00:46.260
The McElroy Brothers

00:46.260 --> 00:48.260
Got such a good heart that

00:48.260 --> 00:50.260
The McElroy Brothers

00:50.260 --> 00:52.260
Make a mother fuckin' wonder if you dead. Damn right

00:52.260 --> 00:54.260
The McElroy Brothers

00:54.260 --> 00:56.260
The McElroy Brothers

00:56.260 --> 00:58.260
I was worried it would break the flow of the song

00:58.260 --> 01:00.260
But it sounds super natural

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
I think it sounds better

01:02.260 --> 01:04.260
Girl Talk actually got in touch with me

01:04.260 --> 01:06.260
Like teach me your secrets

01:06.260 --> 01:08.260
Hi everybody

01:08.260 --> 01:10.260
Is it okay if I lead things off?

01:10.260 --> 01:12.260
Wow okay. Sorry but

01:12.260 --> 01:14.260
I just wanted to bring up before we started

01:14.260 --> 01:16.260
Because it would be a smooth transition

01:16.260 --> 01:18.260
Three different people have come up to me this weekend

01:18.260 --> 01:20.260
And told me that they had horrible dreams about me

01:20.260 --> 01:22.260
So

01:22.260 --> 01:24.260
If anyone can lend any specificity

01:24.260 --> 01:26.260
To the terrible way I'm apparently about to die

01:26.260 --> 01:28.260
So I can look out for it

01:28.260 --> 01:30.260
Omen's importance

01:30.260 --> 01:32.260
You can introduce us now

01:32.260 --> 01:34.260
Hello welcome to my brother and my brother and me

01:34.260 --> 01:36.260
An advice show for the modern era

01:36.260 --> 01:38.260
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:38.260 --> 01:40.260
And I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy

01:40.260 --> 01:42.260
I'm your baby brother Griffin McElroy

01:42.260 --> 01:44.260
If you've never listened to our show shame on you

01:44.260 --> 01:46.260
Yeah

01:46.260 --> 01:48.260
This is an advice show where we help people

01:48.260 --> 01:50.260
We have been here at Mc...

01:50.260 --> 01:52.260
Well hold on

01:52.260 --> 01:54.260
I have a PowerPoint presentation I've prepared

01:54.260 --> 01:56.260
To help this guy...

01:56.260 --> 01:58.260
Fucking brace your asses

01:58.260 --> 02:00.260
This was my first PowerPoint presentation

02:00.260 --> 02:02.260
But I think I really nailed it. Here we go

02:02.260 --> 02:04.260
Okay

02:04.260 --> 02:06.260
Now

02:06.260 --> 02:08.260
Is that

02:08.260 --> 02:10.260
Helvetica?

02:10.260 --> 02:12.260
It's a nice tasteful Helvetica I think

02:12.260 --> 02:14.260
Some nerdlinger here probably knows what it is

02:14.260 --> 02:16.260
Come on

02:16.260 --> 02:18.260
There we go

02:18.260 --> 02:20.260
One nerdlinger was a conservative estimate

02:20.260 --> 02:22.260
Yeah

02:22.260 --> 02:24.260
No smokers

02:24.260 --> 02:26.260
Fourteen thot experts

02:26.260 --> 02:28.260
That's MaxFunCon

02:30.260 --> 02:32.260
So we uh

02:32.260 --> 02:34.260
Did something funny happen to

02:34.260 --> 02:36.260
Were we going to talk about something? I forget

02:36.260 --> 02:38.260
Funny shit happens at camp all the time

02:38.260 --> 02:40.260
Yeah

02:40.260 --> 02:42.260
How has everybody

02:42.260 --> 02:44.260
Else's MaxFun been so far?

02:44.260 --> 02:46.260
MaxFun

02:46.260 --> 02:48.260
That's easy

02:48.260 --> 02:50.260
Raise your hand if you forged

02:50.260 --> 02:52.260
A lifelong friendship this weekend

02:52.260 --> 02:54.260
Lifelong friendships?

02:54.260 --> 02:56.260
That's a lot

02:56.260 --> 02:58.260
That's pretty good

02:58.260 --> 03:00.260
I saw some people not raise their hands which bums me out more than

03:00.260 --> 03:02.260
You have like three hours

03:02.260 --> 03:04.260
For our radio listeners I would say like 90% of the people

03:04.260 --> 03:06.260
Raised their hands but that 10% was like ah come on guys

03:06.260 --> 03:08.260
There was probably a moment where somebody

03:08.260 --> 03:10.260
Raised their hand expecting the person next to them to raise their hand

03:10.260 --> 03:12.260
You didn't

03:12.260 --> 03:14.260
We didn't it seemed

03:14.260 --> 03:16.260
I thought okay

03:16.260 --> 03:18.260
Um

03:18.260 --> 03:20.260
Do you think people get like friendship

03:20.260 --> 03:22.260
Desperate at the end of the party like I drove

03:22.260 --> 03:24.260
All the way up this fucking mountain

03:24.260 --> 03:26.260
It's like last call

03:26.260 --> 03:28.260
I'm not leaving this party at midnight until I find

03:28.260 --> 03:30.260
Someone to be my best friend forever

03:30.260 --> 03:32.260
We wanted to mention

03:32.260 --> 03:34.260
Before we leave the camp

03:34.260 --> 03:36.260
Chat segment of our show

03:36.260 --> 03:38.260
The extended well thought out camp

03:38.260 --> 03:40.260
Chat segment

03:40.260 --> 03:42.260
We will be doing some questions from you the audience

03:42.260 --> 03:44.260
In the second half of our program

03:44.260 --> 03:46.260
So try to think of something

03:46.260 --> 03:48.260
That we can help you with

03:48.260 --> 03:50.260
Don't be a bummer

03:50.260 --> 03:52.260
Nope

03:52.260 --> 03:54.260
Keep it light, keep it fun

03:54.260 --> 03:56.260
And make sure that we remain the center of attention

03:56.260 --> 03:58.260
Did nothing

03:58.260 --> 04:00.260
Did nothing talk worthy

04:00.260 --> 04:02.260
Happen to you guys this weekend camp wise

04:02.260 --> 04:04.260
The only fun moment I had

04:04.260 --> 04:06.260
No

04:06.260 --> 04:08.260
My favorite moment so far

04:08.260 --> 04:10.260
Was Friday night

04:10.260 --> 04:12.260
I was hanging out and I saw this gentleman

04:12.260 --> 04:14.260
Who I was just amazed he was so funny

04:14.260 --> 04:16.260
And I was like you know he should be a comedian

04:16.260 --> 04:18.260
And it was Kyle Kinane

04:18.260 --> 04:20.260
Um

04:20.260 --> 04:22.260
And I did not realize that until Saturday

04:22.260 --> 04:24.260
And I'm just really glad I didn't

04:24.260 --> 04:26.260
Walk up to him like hey kid

04:26.260 --> 04:28.260
Keep those stars in your eyes

04:28.260 --> 04:30.260
I see something raw in you

04:30.260 --> 04:32.260
Something I can mold

04:32.260 --> 04:34.260
I got a pocket

04:34.260 --> 04:36.260
It's a real launching point

04:36.260 --> 04:38.260
We can make you a star

04:38.260 --> 04:40.260
Are we able

04:40.260 --> 04:42.260
To talk

04:42.260 --> 04:44.260
Cause there's this ubiquitous thing that I feel like

04:44.260 --> 04:46.260
Everybody experiences at Max Fun Con

04:46.260 --> 04:48.260
Um

04:48.260 --> 04:50.260
But it involves regularity

04:50.260 --> 04:52.260
So to speak

04:52.260 --> 04:54.260
No I don't want to talk

04:54.260 --> 04:56.260
Is anybody else deucing like a rock star

04:56.260 --> 04:58.260
Like it's your full time job

04:58.260 --> 05:00.260
Is it the altitude

05:00.260 --> 05:02.260
I honestly don't know

05:02.260 --> 05:04.260
What is going on

05:04.260 --> 05:06.260
I can overrule this hold on wait I can save us all

05:06.260 --> 05:08.260
Press the button that we can't

05:08.260 --> 05:10.260
Ah camp is gone

05:10.260 --> 05:12.260
So we were at if you want to discuss it more

05:12.260 --> 05:14.260
Come find me after the show and we'll talk about poop all day

05:14.260 --> 05:16.260
You won't find him

05:16.260 --> 05:18.260
He'll be in the bathroom

05:18.260 --> 05:20.260
So we stopped at

05:20.260 --> 05:22.260
LA Hotspot

05:22.260 --> 05:24.260
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles

05:24.260 --> 05:26.260
The Englewood location

05:26.260 --> 05:28.260
We stopped at the authentic one near LAX

05:28.260 --> 05:30.260
I'm not sure they all seem

05:30.260 --> 05:32.260
Pretty authentic to me

05:32.260 --> 05:34.260
So we ate a big meal and then as we were leaving

05:34.260 --> 05:36.260
We spotted this flyer

05:36.260 --> 05:38.260
Griffin do you still have it with you

05:38.260 --> 05:40.260
I do I don't want to hold up the unsavory parts of it

05:40.260 --> 05:42.260
I'm sure you LA locals

05:42.260 --> 05:44.260
Read it every week you're all

05:44.260 --> 05:46.260
Subscribers

05:46.260 --> 05:48.260
It's LAXpress it's a

05:48.260 --> 05:50.260
Massage guide

05:50.260 --> 05:52.260
It's a massage guide it's what they advertise

05:52.260 --> 05:54.260
Can you fold that half

05:54.260 --> 05:56.260
So yeah

05:56.260 --> 05:58.260
There's a woman in it and she's

05:58.260 --> 06:00.260
We don't want that

06:00.260 --> 06:02.260
We don't want to talk about that because it's gross

06:02.260 --> 06:04.260
The whole flyer is grody

06:04.260 --> 06:06.260
There are full length

06:06.260 --> 06:08.260
Features that are just ripe with

06:08.260 --> 06:10.260
Grossness but there are a few

06:10.260 --> 06:12.260
Pretty amazing things in it

06:12.260 --> 06:14.260
Now keep in mind every page of

06:14.260 --> 06:16.260
This flyer is filled

06:16.260 --> 06:18.260
To the brim with

06:18.260 --> 06:20.260
In

06:20.260 --> 06:22.260
Invitations

06:26.260 --> 06:28.260
Sort of enticements

06:28.260 --> 06:30.260
To the flesh

06:30.260 --> 06:32.260
Honey pots of

06:32.260 --> 06:34.260
Sexual delight for money

06:34.260 --> 06:36.260
Basically except for

06:36.260 --> 06:38.260
These pages

06:38.260 --> 06:40.260
First of all there is a

06:40.260 --> 06:42.260
Full page the entire

06:42.260 --> 06:44.260
The entire rear page

06:44.260 --> 06:46.260
Is dedicated to four movie

06:46.260 --> 06:48.260
Reviews for this massage

06:48.260 --> 06:50.260
Guides in house

06:50.260 --> 06:52.260
Movie critic

06:52.260 --> 06:54.260
I assume

06:54.260 --> 06:56.260
That's a gig you work your way up

06:56.260 --> 06:58.260
To spoiler alert he hated

06:58.260 --> 07:00.260
All four movies

07:00.260 --> 07:02.260
Where's the nudity

07:02.260 --> 07:04.260
I think there's probably nudity

07:04.260 --> 07:06.260
In at least two of these movies

07:06.260 --> 07:08.260
So that's the first page

07:08.260 --> 07:10.260
It gets weirder from here

07:10.260 --> 07:12.260
There's a picture of Brad Pitt

07:12.260 --> 07:14.260
The story above this is not about Brad Pitt

07:14.260 --> 07:16.260
It's about people you can have sex with

07:16.260 --> 07:18.260
In the area that you live

07:18.260 --> 07:20.260
And thank god that right up in the top corner

07:20.260 --> 07:22.260
They've labeled it just in case

07:22.260 --> 07:24.260
Who

07:24.260 --> 07:26.260
This guy's going places

07:26.260 --> 07:28.260
And the piece de resistance

07:28.260 --> 07:30.260
Yeah I actually just wanted to point out

07:30.260 --> 07:32.260
There is an ad on the adjacent page

07:32.260 --> 07:34.260
That is advertising women as silky

07:34.260 --> 07:36.260
Which I did not know

07:36.260 --> 07:38.260
Seems more like a fabric softener

07:38.260 --> 07:40.260
Ad but here

07:40.260 --> 07:42.260
Okay so here's the last one

07:42.260 --> 07:44.260
This is not bullshit this is just one of the pages

07:52.260 --> 07:54.260
So what we're working with

07:54.260 --> 07:56.260
Are audio fans

07:56.260 --> 07:58.260
Our listeners at home are probably just like

07:58.260 --> 08:00.260
It's a butthole it's definitely a butthole

08:00.260 --> 08:02.260
I know I've listened to this show before

08:02.260 --> 08:04.260
It's a ghost horse butthole something

08:04.260 --> 08:06.260
This is Mackenzie

08:06.260 --> 08:08.260
Again still like listeners at home

08:08.260 --> 08:10.260
Like oh man oh no

08:10.260 --> 08:12.260
What's wrong with Mackenzie

08:18.260 --> 08:20.260
It is a

08:20.260 --> 08:22.260
We are talking about a kitten

08:22.260 --> 08:24.260
Sweet precious and I would say

08:24.260 --> 08:26.260
Appropriately horrified

08:26.260 --> 08:28.260
Kitten

08:28.260 --> 08:30.260
This is an advertisement for a local

08:30.260 --> 08:32.260
Animal shelter

08:32.260 --> 08:34.260
Looking to get rid of this cat

08:34.260 --> 08:36.260
Which seems like the most inhumane

08:36.260 --> 08:38.260
Thing ever because this is the

08:38.260 --> 08:40.260
Grossest this is

08:40.260 --> 08:42.260
The grossest publication

08:42.260 --> 08:44.260
Diagram of people who are going yeah I definitely

08:44.260 --> 08:46.260
Want to have some sex and also I'm looking

08:46.260 --> 08:48.260
To adopt a kitten

08:48.260 --> 08:52.260
It's just one circle that says lonely

08:52.260 --> 08:54.260
So anyway

08:54.260 --> 08:56.260
That was the flyer that we found it's time

08:56.260 --> 08:58.260
To get into the vice portion of our program

08:58.260 --> 09:00.260
This is our wheel wheel wheel house I guess

09:00.260 --> 09:02.260
This is where this and talking about

09:02.260 --> 09:04.260
Porn advertisements

09:04.260 --> 09:06.260
Actually that is actually kind of

09:06.260 --> 09:08.260
Our wheelhouse also thanks

09:08.260 --> 09:10.260
So

09:10.260 --> 09:12.260
Here's our first question submitted to us by

09:12.260 --> 09:14.260
A reader earlier

09:14.260 --> 09:16.260
Today I bought lunch at a local bakery

09:16.260 --> 09:18.260
And as an impulse purchase I bought a

09:18.260 --> 09:20.260
York peppermint patty at the register

09:20.260 --> 09:22.260
However despite paying for the candy I accidentally

09:22.260 --> 09:24.260
Walked out without taking the snack

09:24.260 --> 09:26.260
Out of the jar what's worse

09:26.260 --> 09:28.260
I didn't remember that I had abandoned the candy

09:28.260 --> 09:30.260
Until long after the deli had closed

09:30.260 --> 09:32.260
Meaning that if I want to retrieve

09:32.260 --> 09:34.260
The patty I actually have to go back

09:34.260 --> 09:36.260
A full business day later and

09:36.260 --> 09:38.260
Embarrassingly explain my mistake

09:38.260 --> 09:40.260
What is the protocol in these

09:40.260 --> 09:42.260
Situations do I return

09:42.260 --> 09:44.260
Tomorrow and let them know about my

09:44.260 --> 09:46.260
Error or is this a dollar I'm simply

09:46.260 --> 09:48.260
Not going to get back that's from snackless

09:48.260 --> 09:50.260
In San Francisco let me tell you

09:50.260 --> 09:52.260
One thing I know for sure you're getting that

09:52.260 --> 09:54.260
Fucking patty

09:54.260 --> 09:56.260
We are going to get through this

09:56.260 --> 09:58.260
Together

09:58.260 --> 10:00.260
This is a this is a great opportunity

10:00.260 --> 10:02.260
I think to steal

10:02.260 --> 10:04.260
Because you can steal with a clean

10:04.260 --> 10:06.260
Conscious it's yours it's just living

10:06.260 --> 10:08.260
Without the peppermint patties

10:08.260 --> 10:10.260
He did pay he exchanged currency

10:10.260 --> 10:12.260
For goods and services

10:12.260 --> 10:14.260
He just put it on layaway

10:14.260 --> 10:16.260
I got the remaining 37 cents

10:16.260 --> 10:18.260
I'm ready to get the sensation

10:18.260 --> 10:20.260
What if that was this dude's steez

10:20.260 --> 10:22.260
In that he just sort of went around

10:22.260 --> 10:24.260
His town and just sort of

10:24.260 --> 10:26.260
Planted seeds of like next

10:26.260 --> 10:28.260
Time he's in this convenience store

10:28.260 --> 10:30.260
He can be like I need to

10:30.260 --> 10:32.260
You know get a pack of cigarettes and also

10:32.260 --> 10:34.260
You owe me one York peppermint patty that I did

10:34.260 --> 10:36.260
Purchase a while ago and then he has a little surprise

10:36.260 --> 10:38.260
Treaty wasn't expecting review the security

10:38.260 --> 10:40.260
Get the security camera

10:40.260 --> 10:42.260
I did pay for this

10:42.260 --> 10:44.260
That's going to be hard to convince him

10:44.260 --> 10:46.260
To give you that though

10:46.260 --> 10:48.260
Because he's not going to remember your face

10:48.260 --> 10:50.260
There's people in there trying to scam

10:50.260 --> 10:52.260
York peppermint patties all the time

10:52.260 --> 10:54.260
I know how this

10:54.260 --> 10:56.260
I know that you probably get this a lot

10:56.260 --> 10:58.260
But I want to get the sensation

10:58.260 --> 11:00.260
And I did pay for the sensation so just

11:00.260 --> 11:02.260
Give me the patty already you think it's a big patty

11:02.260 --> 11:04.260
These are the big ones one of the small ones

11:04.260 --> 11:06.260
For a dollar you're getting a full

11:06.260 --> 11:08.260
Size patty right one would hope

11:08.260 --> 11:10.260
There's not a joke here

11:10.260 --> 11:12.260
I'm really would like economy

11:12.260 --> 11:14.260
You guys the economy

11:14.260 --> 11:16.260
The joke

11:16.260 --> 11:18.260
We're doing a little bit more observational stuff

11:18.260 --> 11:20.260
This time yeah we're working

11:20.260 --> 11:22.260
Out some new material on this supportive

11:22.260 --> 11:24.260
Crowd you

11:24.260 --> 11:26.260
Want to Yahoo yeah I do thought there'd be more

11:26.260 --> 11:28.260
Meat on the peppermint patty bone yeah me too

11:28.260 --> 11:30.260
I thought it would be funnier for longer but no

11:30.260 --> 11:32.260
So when you guys ever

11:32.260 --> 11:34.260
How do York peppermint patty you guys

11:34.260 --> 11:36.260
Know I'm talking about right behind alley

11:36.260 --> 11:38.260
So we actually have

11:38.260 --> 11:40.260
Another resource for people

11:40.260 --> 11:42.260
That we help

11:42.260 --> 11:44.260
From the Yahoo answers service

11:44.260 --> 11:46.260
Where people submit

11:46.260 --> 11:48.260
Nigh anonymously submit questions

11:48.260 --> 11:50.260
And then we find them

11:50.260 --> 11:52.260
And then we help them whether they

11:52.260 --> 11:54.260
Want it or not so Griffin what's our

11:54.260 --> 11:56.260
What's our first this

11:56.260 --> 11:58.260
Answer was asked by Yahoo answers user Gerald

11:58.260 --> 12:00.260
Who

12:00.260 --> 12:02.260
Asks just Gerald is funny

12:02.260 --> 12:04.260
I guess it is

12:04.260 --> 12:06.260
Context that he's a Yahoo answers user

12:06.260 --> 12:08.260
Paints it paints a real nice picture

12:08.260 --> 12:10.260
Gerald asks

12:10.260 --> 12:12.260
Is it safe to drink my brother's sea monkeys

12:12.260 --> 12:14.260
I

12:14.260 --> 12:16.260
Told

12:16.260 --> 12:18.260
My brother that if he doesn't get back my vintage

12:18.260 --> 12:20.260
Motley Crue t-shirt I got from my uncle by today

12:20.260 --> 12:22.260
I was going to drink his sea monkeys

12:22.260 --> 12:24.260
But he didn't believe me and he didn't

12:24.260 --> 12:26.260
Give it back yet and said he won't

12:26.260 --> 12:28.260
I think I should stand my ground and drink them

12:28.260 --> 12:30.260
But I don't want to die or catch a disease

12:30.260 --> 12:32.260
Or something

12:32.260 --> 12:34.260
You

12:34.260 --> 12:36.260
That I like that stick

12:36.260 --> 12:38.260
To it of this though that's the kind of that's

12:38.260 --> 12:40.260
The kind of gumption this nation was built on

12:40.260 --> 12:42.260
I don't want to drink your weird babies

12:42.260 --> 12:44.260
In water but I'm going to

12:44.260 --> 12:46.260
I want that shirt

12:46.260 --> 12:48.260
He's not going to

12:48.260 --> 12:50.260
Get the shirt back to ultimate we're talking about

12:50.260 --> 12:52.260
We're talking about punitive damage I

12:52.260 --> 12:54.260
Think if you watch a man

12:54.260 --> 12:56.260
Drink your water family

12:56.260 --> 12:58.260
Right in front of you

12:58.260 --> 13:00.260
That is a man who is capable of anything and you will

13:00.260 --> 13:02.260
Give him whatever he wants

13:02.260 --> 13:04.260
I have a particular set of

13:04.260 --> 13:06.260
Skills actually just one it's drinking

13:06.260 --> 13:08.260
Your babies especially

13:08.260 --> 13:10.260
If you don't do it all at once if you just like

13:10.260 --> 13:12.260
Slowly sip and go I'll keep going

13:12.260 --> 13:14.260
I love this

13:14.260 --> 13:16.260
Gerald has informed

13:16.260 --> 13:18.260
Us of what his brother's hierarchy

13:18.260 --> 13:20.260
Of favorite shit that he owns

13:20.260 --> 13:22.260
Is and apparently

13:22.260 --> 13:24.260
At the top of that is a Motley Crue

13:24.260 --> 13:26.260
T-shirt that he is not willing to part with under any

13:26.260 --> 13:28.260
Circumstances and then right behind

13:28.260 --> 13:30.260
That is his sea monkeys and

13:30.260 --> 13:32.260
It's like that dude is beyond punishment

13:32.260 --> 13:34.260
Isn't he?

13:34.260 --> 13:36.260
He's like he's too sad

13:36.260 --> 13:38.260
To fail at that point

13:38.260 --> 13:40.260
I think brother of Gerald has made

13:40.260 --> 13:42.260
A serious miscalculation just

13:42.260 --> 13:44.260
Strategically because he has a pretty clear

13:44.260 --> 13:46.260
Vulnerability what with those pets

13:46.260 --> 13:48.260
And a big tank of water that's made of plastic

13:48.260 --> 13:50.260
I mean you don't even need a brother to drink those

13:50.260 --> 13:52.260
A stiff wind and your whole sea monkey

13:52.260 --> 13:54.260
Or just the passage of like

13:54.260 --> 13:56.260
Six days because that's really all those guys

13:56.260 --> 13:58.260
Have in them. Some of them get very full

13:58.260 --> 14:00.260
That's where shrimp come from. They have bad hearts

14:00.260 --> 14:02.260
Sea monkeys have bad hearts

14:02.260 --> 14:04.260
It's all the inbreeding. Yeah it's true

14:04.260 --> 14:06.260
That's real look it up

14:06.260 --> 14:08.260
What else are they gonna fucking do? They're not gonna

14:08.260 --> 14:10.260
They can't like get out. They can't hold down a job

14:10.260 --> 14:12.260
Maybe it's the best if he does

14:12.260 --> 14:14.260
Drink the sea monkeys. Okay now wait

14:14.260 --> 14:16.260
They would be killed I presume by the stomach

14:16.260 --> 14:18.260
Acid right? Oh god you better

14:18.260 --> 14:20.260
Hope so. Yeah. Or else

14:20.260 --> 14:22.260
You're gonna have a fucking inner space scenario

14:22.260 --> 14:24.260
Happening. You are gonna have an

14:24.260 --> 14:26.260
Inner space on your hands

14:26.260 --> 14:28.260
That's what happens

14:28.260 --> 14:30.260
In that movie. Yeah yeah

14:30.260 --> 14:32.260
Martin Short drinks some

14:32.260 --> 14:34.260
Baby prawns and Dennis Quays like

14:34.260 --> 14:36.260
Don't worry I got this

14:36.260 --> 14:38.260
I'll take him out buddy. Don't worry

14:38.260 --> 14:40.260
I got this prawns. This is inner space 2 where he

14:40.260 --> 14:42.260
Doesn't shrink down. It's a very

14:42.260 --> 14:44.260
He's normal size

14:44.260 --> 14:46.260
Wait okay hold on wait

14:46.260 --> 14:48.260
Are you saying

14:48.260 --> 14:50.260
Martin Short

14:50.260 --> 14:52.260
Full grown Martin Short in inner space

14:52.260 --> 14:54.260
2

14:54.260 --> 14:56.260
Is

14:56.260 --> 14:58.260
Has a full sized Dennis Quaid

14:58.260 --> 15:00.260
Okay we'd have to write

15:00.260 --> 15:02.260
Some sort of sci-fi in the script because we'd have

15:02.260 --> 15:04.260
To shrink Dennis by at least

15:04.260 --> 15:06.260
25 percent. Or

15:06.260 --> 15:08.260
Grow Martin Short. Exactly

15:08.260 --> 15:10.260
Martin Tall

15:10.260 --> 15:12.260
Stupid

15:12.260 --> 15:14.260
Stupid

15:14.260 --> 15:16.260
Low hanging fruit

15:16.260 --> 15:18.260
Idiot

15:18.260 --> 15:20.260
Is that as bad as it's gonna

15:20.260 --> 15:22.260
Get today. God Christ let's

15:22.260 --> 15:24.260
Hope so

15:24.260 --> 15:26.260
I

15:26.260 --> 15:28.260
I think it's safe. I just don't think that

15:28.260 --> 15:30.260
You don't get your shirt back

15:30.260 --> 15:32.260
And you're queasy. And you're both gonna

15:32.260 --> 15:34.260
Know that that happened for the rest of your life

15:34.260 --> 15:36.260
You'll always be able to. That's a thing. Yeah and

15:36.260 --> 15:38.260
You're gonna have sea monkeys controlling you from the inside

15:38.260 --> 15:40.260
That's terrible. It'll be like inner space

15:40.260 --> 15:42.260
You know. Hey if you guys

15:42.260 --> 15:44.260
Inner space jokes

15:44.260 --> 15:46.260
How about the next question Jeff. Okay

15:46.260 --> 15:48.260
Hello brothers

15:48.260 --> 15:50.260
McElroy. This one is actually submitted by

15:50.260 --> 15:52.260
Somebody who is in the audience assuming

15:52.260 --> 15:54.260
They are not hungover or dead

15:54.260 --> 15:56.260
Hello brothers McElroy are you

15:56.260 --> 15:58.260
Having fun at Mac's Fun Con? Me too

15:58.260 --> 16:00.260
This was written before

16:00.260 --> 16:02.260
Mac's Fun Con right? This was before Mac's Fun Con so this is

16:02.260 --> 16:04.260
A big leap

16:04.260 --> 16:06.260
What should I name my car?

16:06.260 --> 16:08.260
It is a 2011 Mazda 2

16:08.260 --> 16:10.260
Hatchback in black. It's very

16:10.260 --> 16:12.260
Cute. I thought I could

16:12.260 --> 16:14.260
Go for a while without naming this car when I first got

16:14.260 --> 16:16.260
It but I've had some bad luck in the first year of my ownership

16:16.260 --> 16:18.260
Broken windshield in the door, punctured

16:18.260 --> 16:20.260
Tire while driving on the highway, broke up with my boyfriend

16:20.260 --> 16:22.260
So I think not

16:22.260 --> 16:24.260
I didn't

16:24.260 --> 16:26.260
Write that. So I think

16:26.260 --> 16:28.260
Not naming the car might have something to do with this

16:28.260 --> 16:30.260
If it helps I name my last

16:30.260 --> 16:32.260
Car Sally Ride

16:32.260 --> 16:34.260
Sincerely

16:34.260 --> 16:36.260
Lisa W. Lisa W are you

16:36.260 --> 16:38.260
With us today? Okay well we'll do our best

16:40.260 --> 16:42.260
Are you blaming all of your bad

16:42.260 --> 16:44.260
Luck on the car? You really think it's the car's

16:44.260 --> 16:46.260
Fault?

16:46.260 --> 16:48.260
Is it a boy car or a girl car?

16:50.260 --> 16:52.260
You didn't ask?

16:52.260 --> 16:54.260
You gotta check, look at the car fact

16:54.260 --> 16:56.260
When it talks

17:00.260 --> 17:02.260
I always wondered what those were for apparently

17:02.260 --> 17:04.260
It's for having your car sexed

17:08.260 --> 17:10.260
What color is it?

17:10.260 --> 17:12.260
Black. That helps. Hatchback

17:12.260 --> 17:14.260
Call it Hatch Black

17:14.260 --> 17:16.260
That's not a good name

17:16.260 --> 17:18.260
What?

17:18.260 --> 17:20.260
Griffin what have you

17:20.260 --> 17:22.260
Have you had a car that you've named in the past?

17:22.260 --> 17:24.260
My 2006

17:24.260 --> 17:26.260
Toyota Matrix. I call it

17:26.260 --> 17:28.260
Trixie because Trix is like in it

17:28.260 --> 17:30.260
It's not funny but

17:30.260 --> 17:32.260
I just answered the question you asked me on stage

17:34.260 --> 17:36.260
Can you call the car

17:36.260 --> 17:38.260
Jason Mrozda and then

17:38.260 --> 17:40.260
Cause those words

17:40.260 --> 17:42.260
Are almost the same

17:42.260 --> 17:44.260
That's actually not bad

17:44.260 --> 17:46.260
How do you feel about Jason Mrozda?

17:46.260 --> 17:48.260
That's pretty good. Hold on

17:48.260 --> 17:50.260
Do you love the music of Jason Mrozda?

17:50.260 --> 17:52.260
Can you learn to?

17:54.260 --> 17:56.260
Can you open your heart

17:56.260 --> 17:58.260
To Jason Mrozda and let him

17:58.260 --> 18:00.260
Just sidle on in?

18:00.260 --> 18:02.260
You gotta jam a cassette

18:02.260 --> 18:04.260
Cause I assume that your 2011

18:04.260 --> 18:06.260
Your car that was produced in 2011 has a cassette

18:06.260 --> 18:08.260
Jam a Mrozda cassette in there

18:08.260 --> 18:10.260
And then get like a butter knife and then

18:10.260 --> 18:12.260
Really wedge it in there and then that'll be like

18:12.260 --> 18:14.260
The permanent soundtrack for Jason Mrozda

18:16.260 --> 18:18.260
It's a super good idea

18:18.260 --> 18:20.260
I worked at a Borders that was exactly like that

18:20.260 --> 18:22.260
24 hours a day

18:22.260 --> 18:24.260
That's not a joke

18:24.260 --> 18:26.260
How about a Yahoo? Yeah sure

18:26.260 --> 18:28.260
Oh this will be interesting if the call and

18:28.260 --> 18:30.260
Response works out

18:30.260 --> 18:32.260
This one was sent in by Ira Ray

18:32.260 --> 18:34.260
Are you Ira Ray?

18:34.260 --> 18:38.260
Wow it works

18:38.260 --> 18:40.260
That is gratifying

18:40.260 --> 18:42.260
It was by Yahoo Answers user

18:42.260 --> 18:44.260
Sammy who asks

18:44.260 --> 18:46.260
What are some simple mysteries that I can solve?

19:00.260 --> 19:02.260
Be serious

19:02.260 --> 19:04.260
My dad said to start

19:04.260 --> 19:06.260
It's misspelled start but it's hard

19:06.260 --> 19:08.260
To pronounce it

19:08.260 --> 19:10.260
Small and build my way up to big mysteries

19:10.260 --> 19:12.260
Like spirits in houses, hauntings, etc

19:12.260 --> 19:14.260
I need to know

19:14.260 --> 19:16.260
Some simple cases, please and thank you

19:18.260 --> 19:20.260
One of the more mannerly Yahoo Answers

19:20.260 --> 19:22.260
Yeah I like that

19:22.260 --> 19:24.260
Don't start with Encyclopedia Brown

19:24.260 --> 19:26.260
Those were way hard for me still

19:26.260 --> 19:28.260
I cracked one open recently

19:28.260 --> 19:30.260
I'm 32 now, these should be

19:30.260 --> 19:32.260
I'm cut to 20 minutes later

19:32.260 --> 19:34.260
The first Battle of Bull Run couldn't have been this

19:34.260 --> 19:36.260
Because the sword said on that

19:36.260 --> 19:38.260
Love those books

19:38.260 --> 19:40.260
Didn't make me any better

19:40.260 --> 19:42.260
At mysteries though

19:42.260 --> 19:44.260
I think your parents have to plan the mysteries for you

19:44.260 --> 19:46.260
I don't know how old this person is

19:46.260 --> 19:48.260
I hope not too old

19:50.260 --> 19:52.260
You gotta get an early start on the mystery game

19:52.260 --> 19:54.260
It's like being a gymnast

19:54.260 --> 19:56.260
You can't start young

19:56.260 --> 19:58.260
What could start as a small mystery

19:58.260 --> 20:00.260
Could unfurl to be like

20:00.260 --> 20:02.260
Gangland violence

20:02.260 --> 20:04.260
Drug trade

20:04.260 --> 20:06.260
Just like a national treasure

20:06.260 --> 20:08.260
He's trying to find the constitution

20:08.260 --> 20:10.260
And then it turns into a whole thing

20:10.260 --> 20:12.260
Starts out with him doing a tricky sudoku

20:12.260 --> 20:14.260
And by the end of it he's just wrapped up

20:14.260 --> 20:16.260
In a fucking John Voight shoot em up

20:16.260 --> 20:18.260
That is the problem

20:18.260 --> 20:20.260
If you've ever read any

20:20.260 --> 20:22.260
Mystery, it always starts

20:22.260 --> 20:24.260
With what appears to be a simple mystery

20:24.260 --> 20:26.260
I don't think you can definitively say

20:26.260 --> 20:28.260
This is gonna pan out

20:28.260 --> 20:30.260
To be very simple

20:30.260 --> 20:32.260
Because what if it's like that sweater

20:32.260 --> 20:34.260
You start pulling that yarn and then it's just

20:34.260 --> 20:36.260
There's a whole case here

20:36.260 --> 20:38.260
Then you have the mystery of the unraveled sweater

20:38.260 --> 20:40.260
Your mom is super pissed off

20:40.260 --> 20:42.260
That her sweater is fucking gone

20:42.260 --> 20:44.260
And she's like here's a mystery

20:44.260 --> 20:46.260
Mystery solved

20:46.260 --> 20:48.260
That was simple

20:48.260 --> 20:50.260
Let me look at some clues

20:50.260 --> 20:52.260
It's a pretty good clue

20:52.260 --> 20:54.260
When we were little

20:54.260 --> 20:56.260
When we were kids

20:56.260 --> 20:58.260
When we were smaller

20:58.260 --> 21:00.260
I don't think Griffin was born yet

21:00.260 --> 21:02.260
Can we not tell the story then

21:02.260 --> 21:04.260
This is BGM

21:04.260 --> 21:06.260
Before Griffin McElroy

21:06.260 --> 21:08.260
Travis and I had

21:08.260 --> 21:10.260
Discovered food coloring

21:10.260 --> 21:12.260
So we filled

21:12.260 --> 21:14.260
Every drink we could get

21:14.260 --> 21:16.260
Our hands on with food coloring

21:16.260 --> 21:18.260
And then we decided

21:18.260 --> 21:20.260
To see what effect it would have on the carpets

21:20.260 --> 21:22.260
And then

21:22.260 --> 21:24.260
And then our mom came down

21:24.260 --> 21:26.260
And I just

21:26.260 --> 21:28.260
Wanted to tell this story because that seems like a pretty

21:28.260 --> 21:30.260
Easy mystery for her to solve

21:30.260 --> 21:32.260
So if you could set that up for him

21:32.260 --> 21:34.260
Just put some food coloring on your mouth and on the couch

21:34.260 --> 21:36.260
And then sit there and wait

21:36.260 --> 21:38.260
And I think that as his parents

21:38.260 --> 21:40.260
It would be pretty easy

21:40.260 --> 21:42.260
That was also just a really good bit for the family

21:42.260 --> 21:44.260
Circus fans in the audience

21:44.260 --> 21:46.260
Not me

21:46.260 --> 21:48.260
People who don't like all the blue humor we usually do

21:48.260 --> 21:50.260
And just want some Dennis the Menace-esque

21:50.260 --> 21:52.260
I don't think there's anything wrong with being

21:52.260 --> 21:54.260
Tasteful for a few minutes

21:54.260 --> 21:56.260
I've been pushing to get us to be a little

21:56.260 --> 21:58.260
Cleaner and I think that was a great start

21:58.260 --> 22:00.260
What did you guys think?

22:00.260 --> 22:02.260
We don't

22:02.260 --> 22:04.260
That was muted

22:04.260 --> 22:06.260
That was definitely muted

22:06.260 --> 22:08.260
You want to do another question

22:08.260 --> 22:10.260
It's actually my turn

22:10.260 --> 22:12.260
Oh wait

22:12.260 --> 22:14.260
Don't worry I was

22:14.260 --> 22:16.260
Not allowed to do that

22:16.260 --> 22:18.260
Yeah

22:18.260 --> 22:20.260
No sad libs

22:20.260 --> 22:22.260
No

22:22.260 --> 22:24.260
It's the worst

22:24.260 --> 22:26.260
Whoa

22:26.260 --> 22:28.260
You guys know I can't improv

22:28.260 --> 22:30.260
I can't just make it up

22:30.260 --> 22:32.260
There's just a story

22:32.260 --> 22:34.260
When you improv mad libs it's just shouting

22:34.260 --> 22:36.260
It's time

22:36.260 --> 22:38.260
For a break for some farm wisdom

22:38.260 --> 22:40.260
Farm wisdom

22:40.260 --> 22:42.260
Here's a song that I just wrote

22:42.260 --> 22:44.260
Farm wisdom

22:44.260 --> 22:46.260
I think he just did the Hot Pockets

22:46.260 --> 22:48.260
Farm wisdom

22:48.260 --> 22:50.260
Farm wisdom

22:50.260 --> 22:52.260
It's a song that I just wrote

22:52.260 --> 22:54.260
Farm wisdom

22:54.260 --> 22:56.260
Come on and get yourself a goat

22:56.260 --> 22:58.260
There's two more verses in there

22:58.260 --> 23:00.260
In that beautiful head of yours

23:00.260 --> 23:02.260
Maybe not

23:02.260 --> 23:04.260
Farm wisdom

23:04.260 --> 23:06.260
This comes from

23:06.260 --> 23:08.260
Here's a bit of wisdom

23:08.260 --> 23:10.260
If you see a skunk or possum

23:10.260 --> 23:12.260
During the day or any nocturnal creature

23:12.260 --> 23:14.260
You shouldn't approach it

23:14.260 --> 23:16.260
It usually means that there's something wrong with them

23:16.260 --> 23:18.260
And that they're sick

23:18.260 --> 23:20.260
That sickness is usually rabies

23:20.260 --> 23:22.260
Farm wisdom

23:22.260 --> 23:24.260
Here's a song that I just wrote

23:24.260 --> 23:26.260
Farm wisdom

23:26.260 --> 23:28.260
In what scenario at any time of day do you see a skunk or a possum

23:28.260 --> 23:30.260
Like oh I gotta get up on that

23:30.260 --> 23:32.260
Hey little guy let me approach you

23:32.260 --> 23:34.260
Don't worry it's nighttime

23:34.260 --> 23:36.260
This is totally cool

23:36.260 --> 23:38.260
I'm gonna adopt you and teach you to pick pockets

23:38.260 --> 23:40.260
Come hang out with me

23:40.260 --> 23:42.260
The only way I approach a skunk is if there is a larger skunk behind me

23:42.260 --> 23:44.260
That's it, that's all

23:44.260 --> 23:46.260
You guys ever seen a raccoon

23:46.260 --> 23:48.260
Like in real life?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.260
Yeah they're dicks

23:50.260 --> 23:52.260
There was one on our balcony once

23:52.260 --> 23:54.260
Not a joke

23:54.260 --> 23:56.260
Obviously

23:56.260 --> 23:58.260
Clearly not a joke

24:00.260 --> 24:02.260
How about an actual question

24:02.260 --> 24:04.260
Okay let me actually

24:04.260 --> 24:06.260
Let's help somebody for once

24:06.260 --> 24:08.260
My cowork and I have been dating for the last year

24:08.260 --> 24:10.260
You wanna start over?

24:10.260 --> 24:12.260
Can you edit that not Griffin

24:12.260 --> 24:14.260
All of you

24:14.260 --> 24:16.260
Up here

24:16.260 --> 24:18.260
And set that out

24:18.260 --> 24:20.260
My coworker and I have been dating for the last year

24:20.260 --> 24:22.260
Since I don't answer to him

24:22.260 --> 24:24.260
And he doesn't answer to me

24:24.260 --> 24:26.260
There is no rule in it

24:26.260 --> 24:28.260
However we've done our best to keep it on the DL

24:28.260 --> 24:30.260
To avoid gossip

24:30.260 --> 24:32.260
Recently when we were put

24:32.260 --> 24:34.260
When we put in matching vacation requests

24:34.260 --> 24:36.260
My manager put two and two together

24:36.260 --> 24:38.260
And figured it out

24:38.260 --> 24:40.260
My question is does there need to be

24:40.260 --> 24:42.260
An I know you know conversation

24:42.260 --> 24:44.260
If so how do I broach the subject

24:44.260 --> 24:46.260
Of our not so new relationship to reassure her

24:46.260 --> 24:48.260
She hasn't been duped

24:48.260 --> 24:50.260
And reiterate my good work ethic

24:50.260 --> 24:52.260
And loyalty to her

24:52.260 --> 24:54.260
And the company that's from Exposed

24:54.260 --> 24:56.260
Wait so the fear here is that the manager

24:56.260 --> 24:58.260
Found out and went why didn't you tell me

25:00.260 --> 25:02.260
I'm so hurt

25:02.260 --> 25:04.260
I thought we were close

25:04.260 --> 25:06.260
We go to Margarita Tuesdays every week

25:06.260 --> 25:08.260
You gotta not do it at all

25:08.260 --> 25:10.260
Is the right answer

25:10.260 --> 25:12.260
Because it's not her fucking business

25:12.260 --> 25:14.260
I guess it is

25:14.260 --> 25:16.260
It is her business

25:16.260 --> 25:18.260
Literally it's her business

25:18.260 --> 25:20.260
Finances and profit margins

25:24.260 --> 25:26.260
I think one of my rules is

25:26.260 --> 25:28.260
If you want to

25:28.260 --> 25:30.260
Convince someone that you haven't been

25:30.260 --> 25:32.260
Hiding something from them

25:32.260 --> 25:34.260
The time to tell them is not

25:34.260 --> 25:36.260
After they discover

25:36.260 --> 25:38.260
That is a tough

25:38.260 --> 25:40.260
Sell if you can pull that off

25:40.260 --> 25:42.260
This is apparently a simple mystery

25:42.260 --> 25:44.260
That somebody can solve

25:44.260 --> 25:46.260
There you go

25:46.260 --> 25:48.260
Here's the thing

25:48.260 --> 25:50.260
You are just going to deflate

25:50.260 --> 25:52.260
Your boss if you come out and tell her straight up

25:52.260 --> 25:54.260
Because either she's very satisfied

25:54.260 --> 25:56.260
With herself that she fucking cracked

25:56.260 --> 25:58.260
This da Vinci code

25:58.260 --> 26:00.260
This sexy sexy da Vinci code that's going on

26:00.260 --> 26:02.260
Right under her nose

26:02.260 --> 26:04.260
It's going to diminish the sexiness

26:04.260 --> 26:06.260
Of the whole thing to be like

26:06.260 --> 26:08.260
Yeah we are together

26:08.260 --> 26:10.260
And it's not a sexy dark sexy secret

26:10.260 --> 26:12.260
Say sexy more

26:12.260 --> 26:14.260
I'll get to it

26:14.260 --> 26:16.260
I want to space him out

26:16.260 --> 26:18.260
I mean they have to know

26:18.260 --> 26:20.260
You have to tell them

26:20.260 --> 26:22.260
But I do think it sets up an unrealistic

26:22.260 --> 26:24.260
I don't have an end of the sentence

26:24.260 --> 26:26.260
Is there a way you can say it

26:26.260 --> 26:28.260
That acknowledges the fact that they already know

26:28.260 --> 26:30.260
That you are dead

26:30.260 --> 26:32.260
Say oh yeah we are going on vacation together

26:32.260 --> 26:34.260
We are brother and sister

26:34.260 --> 26:36.260
And we have been hiding it

26:36.260 --> 26:38.260
From you all this time

26:38.260 --> 26:40.260
We are related this whole time

26:40.260 --> 26:42.260
We are the same person

26:42.260 --> 26:44.260
Surprise

26:44.260 --> 26:46.260
You are missing the obvious answer

26:46.260 --> 26:48.260
That doesn't sound like us

26:48.260 --> 26:50.260
I know you have to admit it to everyone

26:50.260 --> 26:52.260
Come clean but then stage a big fight and break up

26:52.260 --> 26:54.260
Re-hide the secret

26:54.260 --> 26:56.260
Double back on your secret

26:56.260 --> 26:58.260
It's sexy again

26:58.260 --> 27:00.260
Maybe this time you invite another person

27:00.260 --> 27:02.260
And just keep growing the sexy

27:02.260 --> 27:04.260
It got weird

27:04.260 --> 27:06.260
I got halfway through that sentence

27:06.260 --> 27:08.260
No no no no

27:08.260 --> 27:10.260
It's too late

27:10.260 --> 27:12.260
My new thing is

27:12.260 --> 27:14.260
This is a secret improv

27:14.260 --> 27:16.260
You can take this one if you want

27:16.260 --> 27:18.260
If you don't have a joke

27:18.260 --> 27:20.260
Just say you don't have one

27:20.260 --> 27:22.260
And then wait

27:22.260 --> 27:24.260
Another joke will find its way

27:24.260 --> 27:26.260
Onto your path

27:26.260 --> 27:28.260
In a very organic manner

27:28.260 --> 27:30.260
Sometimes I start a sentence thinking I have a joke

27:30.260 --> 27:32.260
And I realize I'm just saying

27:32.260 --> 27:34.260
Literally the next word

27:34.260 --> 27:36.260
Conjunction

27:36.260 --> 27:38.260
Article

27:38.260 --> 27:40.260
Is there a subject coming up?

27:40.260 --> 27:42.260
Just keep the ball up in the air

27:42.260 --> 27:44.260
Mr. Conjunction fuck it

27:44.260 --> 27:46.260
Roll with the punches

27:46.260 --> 27:48.260
How about another yahoo?

27:48.260 --> 27:50.260
Yeah sounds good

27:50.260 --> 27:52.260
This one was sent in by Ira Ray

27:52.260 --> 27:54.260
No I don't do it twice

27:54.260 --> 27:56.260
Yeah

27:56.260 --> 27:58.260
It's by yahoo answers user

27:58.260 --> 28:00.260
Wewalkalone

28:00.260 --> 28:02.260
Who asks

28:02.260 --> 28:04.260
You are sitting

28:04.260 --> 28:06.260
Registering for yahoo answers

28:06.260 --> 28:08.260
You know what's sad?

28:08.260 --> 28:10.260
Is that the O in alone

28:10.260 --> 28:12.260
Is like a special character

28:12.260 --> 28:14.260
It's like the O with the slash through

28:14.260 --> 28:16.260
Like a no smoking sign

28:16.260 --> 28:18.260
I don't know what that's called or what its purpose is

28:18.260 --> 28:20.260
Tilde

28:20.260 --> 28:22.260
It's an interior tilde

28:22.260 --> 28:24.260
Which intimates that

28:24.260 --> 28:26.260
Somebody else already registered

28:26.260 --> 28:28.260
Wewalkalone

28:28.260 --> 28:30.260
I bet there's probably a few variations on that throughout

28:30.260 --> 28:32.260
Wewalkalone asks

28:32.260 --> 28:34.260
How do you ask a girl out to breakfast

28:34.260 --> 28:36.260
Without it sounding like you want a one night stand?

28:36.260 --> 28:38.260
This is

28:38.260 --> 28:40.260
This is a tricky needle to thread

28:40.260 --> 28:42.260
Additional details

28:42.260 --> 28:44.260
She loves waffles

28:44.260 --> 28:46.260
And basically most breakfast foods

28:46.260 --> 28:48.260
Is that any additional details?

28:48.260 --> 28:50.260
Yeah that's it

28:50.260 --> 28:52.260
Okay so that does tell you something about our character

28:56.260 --> 28:58.260
I mean you could go the blunt approach

28:58.260 --> 29:00.260
And say I want you to have waffles but not sex

29:00.260 --> 29:02.260
That's how actually I order it

29:02.260 --> 29:04.260
I hop every time

29:04.260 --> 29:06.260
Me? I'm going to have

29:08.260 --> 29:10.260
I don't look so good

29:10.260 --> 29:12.260
I'm so hungry we waited a long time

29:12.260 --> 29:14.260
I'm going to have waffles but not sex

29:16.260 --> 29:18.260
Please do not try to have sex with me

29:18.260 --> 29:20.260
Keep it under your apron darling

29:24.260 --> 29:26.260
Is he wearing

29:26.260 --> 29:28.260
And also some berries

29:30.260 --> 29:32.260
And no sex

29:32.260 --> 29:34.260
Some sex, some light sex

29:34.260 --> 29:36.260
This is my fourth time at IHOP

29:36.260 --> 29:38.260
I'm willing to entertain it

29:38.260 --> 29:40.260
Do you still have the bottomless sex?

29:40.260 --> 29:44.260
The bottomless sex?

29:44.260 --> 29:46.260
Wait

30:00.260 --> 30:02.260
I get it

30:02.260 --> 30:04.260
Okay

30:04.260 --> 30:06.260
If this guy is worried

30:06.260 --> 30:08.260
That she is going to

30:08.260 --> 30:10.260
Assume that post breakfast

30:10.260 --> 30:12.260
He is going to want to have sex with her

30:12.260 --> 30:14.260
That it seems like a fallacious

30:14.260 --> 30:16.260
Thing to be worried about

30:16.260 --> 30:18.260
Because nobody has ever

30:18.260 --> 30:20.260
Eaten waffles and then been like

30:20.260 --> 30:22.260
I feel like ready to get down

30:24.260 --> 30:26.260
People in this room are fucking chock full

30:26.260 --> 30:28.260
Of cheese blintzes, nobody's looking around like

30:28.260 --> 30:30.260
Who's going to be my 11 o'clock hook up?

30:32.260 --> 30:34.260
I wish I was napping

30:34.260 --> 30:36.260
I wish these three brothers would be quiet so I could take a

30:36.260 --> 30:38.260
Theater nap

30:38.260 --> 30:40.260
Griffin actually wouldn't let us

30:40.260 --> 30:42.260
Me and Travis have cheese blintzes

30:42.260 --> 30:44.260
He said we wouldn't be funny if we ate those

30:44.260 --> 30:46.260
He said we'd be too full

30:46.260 --> 30:48.260
This is not a joke

30:48.260 --> 30:50.260
Griffin has gotten super protective of my diet

30:50.260 --> 30:52.260
The whole time I've been here

30:52.260 --> 30:54.260
He's been really demonstrative

30:54.260 --> 30:56.260
Justin kept getting

30:56.260 --> 30:58.260
I don't want to put you on fire

30:58.260 --> 31:00.260
Justin kept getting salads

31:00.260 --> 31:02.260
And then just like

31:02.260 --> 31:04.260
Eating around them in such a perfect manner

31:04.260 --> 31:06.260
The salad would sit unmolested

31:06.260 --> 31:08.260
Like in the perfect shape that he put it

31:08.260 --> 31:10.260
On the plate

31:10.260 --> 31:12.260
And he even addressed the fact like

31:12.260 --> 31:14.260
Maybe next time salad

31:14.260 --> 31:16.260
I thought about a salad

31:16.260 --> 31:18.260
I want to be the sort of

31:18.260 --> 31:20.260
I look around

31:20.260 --> 31:22.260
I look around at everybody here and everybody's getting salad

31:22.260 --> 31:24.260
Like they like it and I just think I want to be

31:24.260 --> 31:26.260
I want to be where the people are

31:26.260 --> 31:28.260
Eating that salad

31:28.260 --> 31:30.260
And seeming to enjoy it

31:30.260 --> 31:32.260
People are getting salad

31:32.260 --> 31:34.260
With their own volition

31:34.260 --> 31:36.260
Like it has a flavor that they like

31:36.260 --> 31:38.260
And I don't know how to process it

31:38.260 --> 31:40.260
So I just get some salad and then I get embarrassed

31:40.260 --> 31:42.260
Because I eat everything else because it all tastes better than salad

31:42.260 --> 31:44.260
You're so much of a salad

31:44.260 --> 31:46.260
Salad noob Mario

31:46.260 --> 31:48.260
But you know you don't walk back with the salad on your plate

31:48.260 --> 31:50.260
To throw it away and then go we tried

31:50.260 --> 31:52.260
He's wasting it

31:52.260 --> 31:54.260
So that's good

31:54.260 --> 31:56.260
He thinks oh that's salad that somebody else doesn't have to eat

31:56.260 --> 31:58.260
You're welcome the rest of the world

31:58.260 --> 32:00.260
Oh god I've been waiting

32:00.260 --> 32:02.260
I hope the salad bowl will be empty

32:02.260 --> 32:04.260
Those stars

32:04.260 --> 32:06.260
Actually aligned yesterday there was no salad

32:06.260 --> 32:08.260
Gotta rough up

32:08.260 --> 32:10.260
The first time I got no

32:10.260 --> 32:12.260
I did not realize

32:12.260 --> 32:14.260
Here's my salad in expertise

32:14.260 --> 32:16.260
I got no dressing

32:16.260 --> 32:18.260
So just a big pile of

32:18.260 --> 32:20.260
Leaves and then

32:20.260 --> 32:22.260
The next time I grabbed

32:22.260 --> 32:24.260
Something that looked like dressing and was

32:24.260 --> 32:26.260
Olive oil so I just kind of coated it

32:26.260 --> 32:28.260
I wondered why you were doing that

32:28.260 --> 32:30.260
I don't know what dressing is

32:30.260 --> 32:32.260
You were doing like a fancy flourish

32:32.260 --> 32:34.260
Like a subway sandwich artist and I was like what are you

32:34.260 --> 32:36.260
That's not for that

32:36.260 --> 32:38.260
For a time I tried to get into salad

32:38.260 --> 32:40.260
At restaurants my lovely wife

32:40.260 --> 32:42.260
Can attest to this I tried to get into salads

32:42.260 --> 32:44.260
At restaurants by asking them to bring

32:44.260 --> 32:46.260
A side of pizza sauce

32:52.260 --> 32:54.260
What was the illusion that you were

32:54.260 --> 32:56.260
Chasing there like it's

32:56.260 --> 32:58.260
Tomatoes

32:58.260 --> 33:00.260
Did any waiter ever act like that was

33:00.260 --> 33:02.260
Something anyone else had ever done

33:02.260 --> 33:04.260
Oh yeah pizza salad

33:04.260 --> 33:06.260
That's actually right there on your sides

33:06.260 --> 33:08.260
Is it possible for you to serve the salad in like a

33:08.260 --> 33:10.260
Bread bowl but like just flat and triangular

33:10.260 --> 33:12.260
And like if you want to melt some cheese on there

33:12.260 --> 33:14.260
And let's get a light on the leaves

33:14.260 --> 33:16.260
You can I want pizza

33:16.260 --> 33:18.260
Can the leaves be from a pepperoni tree

33:22.260 --> 33:24.260
Anyway Justin didn't eat a salad and I had to develop

33:24.260 --> 33:26.260
A system of reward points that he could

33:26.260 --> 33:28.260
Exchange for dessert

33:30.260 --> 33:32.260
I would be eating a bite of salad

33:32.260 --> 33:34.260
And Griffin would say I

33:34.260 --> 33:36.260
That looks like about 80 cookie points

33:36.260 --> 33:38.260
You need 100 cookie points to get a cookie

33:38.260 --> 33:40.260
So you can either have 8 tenths

33:40.260 --> 33:42.260
Of a cookie now or you can finish the last

33:42.260 --> 33:44.260
Two bites of your salad

33:44.260 --> 33:46.260
I'm 32 years old and it worked

33:46.260 --> 33:48.260
On me like a child

33:48.260 --> 33:50.260
God

33:50.260 --> 33:52.260
Help me if I didn't just alright come on

33:52.260 --> 33:54.260
Salad you don't like me and I

33:54.260 --> 33:56.260
Don't like you let's finish this

33:58.260 --> 34:00.260
So this is the part of the show

34:00.260 --> 34:02.260
Where we are

34:02.260 --> 34:04.260
Going to take questions from the

A hundred percent fucking

36:10.260 --> 36:12.260
Start beginning middle and

36:12.260 --> 36:14.260
I literally said the phrase a kicked

36:14.260 --> 36:16.260
Puppy every fucking sentence had

36:16.260 --> 36:18.260
An element a taste of bummerness in it

36:18.260 --> 36:20.260
Somewhere I look we learned about pie

36:20.260 --> 36:22.260
Making yesterday and they said you have to have butter

36:22.260 --> 36:24.260
All through the crust and you had bummer all

36:24.260 --> 36:26.260
Through the question the bummer

36:26.260 --> 36:28.260
Melts to leave flakiness

Could just walk into the room go I'm good

Yeah that's what people who

36:38.260 --> 36:40.260

Look and walk in the room I'm doing

36:48.260 --> 36:50.260
All for that

36:50.260 --> 36:52.260
Without anybody asking that's important

36:52.260 --> 36:54.260
You got to lead with hey I'm good

36:54.260 --> 36:56.260
I'm doing fine hey why

36:56.260 --> 36:58.260
Do you want to shake it why don't you parlay it

36:58.260 --> 37:00.260
You get parlayed in one

37:00.260 --> 37:02.260
A promotion maybe

37:02.260 --> 37:04.260
He's already done that twice

37:04.260 --> 37:06.260
Okay so you've been you're already making it work for you

37:06.260 --> 37:08.260
For your promotion no I'm sure you're very

37:08.260 --> 37:10.260
Talented at what you do yeah it was a pity promotion

37:10.260 --> 37:12.260
Yeah nice

37:12.260 --> 37:14.260
That's good Greg that's the way to pick up our

37:14.260 --> 37:16.260
Spirits yeah now you're

37:16.260 --> 37:18.260
Guilting us now it's about you

37:18.260 --> 37:20.260
It's because of excellence yeah there

37:20.260 --> 37:22.260
In your field what field is it

37:22.260 --> 37:24.260
Maybe we can find some humor in there

37:26.260 --> 37:28.260
It's got to be somewhere right

37:28.260 --> 37:30.260
I teach poetry and theater okay

37:30.260 --> 37:32.260
Okay what okay

37:32.260 --> 37:34.260
If I may what

37:34.260 --> 37:42.260
Emotions are there in that job

37:42.260 --> 37:44.260
They give you more kids

37:44.260 --> 37:46.260
There's ten more you're doing

37:46.260 --> 37:48.260
This year you get a desk

37:48.260 --> 37:50.260
Greg I think

37:50.260 --> 37:52.260
That you you I can

37:52.260 --> 37:54.260
Understand why you think that the good news

37:54.260 --> 37:56.260
I think is that people

37:56.260 --> 37:58.260
Will always think about

37:58.260 --> 38:00.260
Others a lot less than they think about

38:00.260 --> 38:02.260
Themselves so if you

38:02.260 --> 38:04.260
Just do Greg

38:04.260 --> 38:06.260
Just do Greg for

38:06.260 --> 38:08.260
A few more weeks I think how long

38:08.260 --> 38:10.260
Was the relationship nine years

38:10.260 --> 38:12.260
Okay three more weeks

38:12.260 --> 38:14.260
Do Greg three more

38:14.260 --> 38:16.260
Weeks and people will

38:16.260 --> 38:18.260
Inevitably move on to their own problems

38:18.260 --> 38:20.260
They cannot keep in their head

38:20.260 --> 38:22.260
Actual facts about other humans that

38:22.260 --> 38:24.260
Long they have to just let it slip out so they can

38:24.260 --> 38:26.260
Remember the lyrics to the new

38:26.260 --> 38:28.260
Song

38:28.260 --> 38:30.260
They're hard to memorize because they're not

38:30.260 --> 38:32.260
English

38:32.260 --> 38:34.260
Greg

38:34.260 --> 38:36.260
Yeah yeah so patience

38:36.260 --> 38:38.260
Patience Greg

38:38.260 --> 38:40.260
This too shall pass

38:40.260 --> 38:42.260
Like okay go said

38:42.260 --> 38:44.260
This too shall pass

38:44.260 --> 38:46.260
Should I do the dance from that video you definitely

38:46.260 --> 38:48.260
Should not do that

38:48.260 --> 38:50.260
Thanks Greg

38:50.260 --> 38:52.260
Round of applause for Greg he really put himself

38:52.260 --> 38:54.260
Out there even though we expressly

38:54.260 --> 38:56.260
Asked him from doing so

38:56.260 --> 38:58.260
Anybody

38:58.260 --> 39:00.260
Who's hand

39:00.260 --> 39:02.260
Went up first I'm terrible at this yeah

39:02.260 --> 39:04.260
Yes we got time for everybody I'm going to help everyone

39:04.260 --> 39:06.260
In this room it's not like we have to go anywhere

39:06.260 --> 39:08.260
I'm going to break these fishes and loaves up where

39:08.260 --> 39:10.260
I was going to Jesse how much would it cost us to lock

39:10.260 --> 39:12.260
Down Lake Arrowhead for another day

39:12.260 --> 39:14.260
Just he's not going to answer that

39:14.260 --> 39:16.260
Probably an astronaut that's fair that's good

39:16.260 --> 39:18.260
Good instinct hi what's your name

39:18.260 --> 39:20.260
So I'm Laura hi Laura

39:20.260 --> 39:22.260
From the Midwest I hide

39:22.260 --> 39:24.260
The Midwest all of it well most

39:24.260 --> 39:26.260
Of it she's a rambler

39:26.260 --> 39:28.260
It's true Ohio

39:28.260 --> 39:30.260
Iowa Michigan

39:30.260 --> 39:32.260
That's it you touched you touched

39:32.260 --> 39:34.260
Them all what's your what's your what's your question

39:34.260 --> 39:36.260
So my question is if you're

39:36.260 --> 39:38.260
Cheap and you say don't want

39:38.260 --> 39:40.260
To check your baggage how might

39:40.260 --> 39:42.260
You get your rocket lube past

39:42.260 --> 39:44.260
Security

39:44.260 --> 39:46.260
I'll tell you no no no

39:46.260 --> 39:48.260
This is great because this is a universal

39:48.260 --> 39:50.260
Question everyone's worried about right now

39:50.260 --> 39:52.260
Because you're not leaving it here

39:52.260 --> 39:54.260
You finally got

39:54.260 --> 39:56.260
Lube without having to buy it from a store

39:56.260 --> 39:58.260
You're never

39:58.260 --> 40:00.260
Letting it go this is the loophole

40:00.260 --> 40:02.260
Or making it

40:02.260 --> 40:04.260
Making it yourself out of coconut

40:04.260 --> 40:06.260
Oil

40:06.260 --> 40:08.260
You don't really have to make anything you just

40:08.260 --> 40:10.260
Use the coconut

40:10.260 --> 40:12.260
You go to Target and you buy

40:12.260 --> 40:14.260
The travel pack of empty

40:14.260 --> 40:16.260
Three ounce bottles and then you just split

40:16.260 --> 40:18.260
It into multiple three ounce bottles

40:18.260 --> 40:20.260
And then you actually have to say I'm putting lube

40:20.260 --> 40:22.260
In these and then you line them

40:22.260 --> 40:24.260
Up on your nightstand so when people come in

40:24.260 --> 40:26.260
You'd be like this is my collection

40:26.260 --> 40:28.260
There's single server or you could do

40:28.260 --> 40:30.260
Like the bandolero of just lube

40:30.260 --> 40:32.260
Packets

40:32.260 --> 40:34.260
Lube of sexual

40:34.260 --> 40:36.260
Lube this is

40:36.260 --> 40:38.260
Of a lubricant that one uses during

40:38.260 --> 40:40.260
Love making this is gonna be gross

40:40.260 --> 40:42.260
Do we know if the bottle is under

40:42.260 --> 40:44.260
Like do we know if the bottle is

40:44.260 --> 40:46.260
Under over three point six ounces

40:46.260 --> 40:48.260
Yeah it's four ounces

40:48.260 --> 40:50.260
Okay first off you gotta drink some

40:52.260 --> 40:54.260
This is gonna be

40:54.260 --> 40:56.260
Simultaneously gross and too forward

40:56.260 --> 40:58.260
To bring up to a stranger but if you are

40:58.260 --> 41:00.260
Going to hide it in a cavity it will be

41:00.260 --> 41:02.260
Super easy to do so

41:04.260 --> 41:06.260
Cause you have what you

41:06.260 --> 41:08.260
Have what you need to do that

41:08.260 --> 41:10.260
And the problem with the bottle itself

41:10.260 --> 41:12.260
Is that you can't use that bottle

41:12.260 --> 41:14.260
Because can you imagine

41:14.260 --> 41:16.260
That TSA security screening guy

41:16.260 --> 41:18.260
Dressed down by a superior just to be clear

41:18.260 --> 41:20.260
We're keeping an eye out for

41:20.260 --> 41:22.260
Terrorist threats and the bottle said

41:22.260 --> 41:24.260
Rocket lube

41:24.260 --> 41:26.260
Nothing set off any alarms there

41:26.260 --> 41:28.260
That maybe it is right that's what you use

41:28.260 --> 41:30.260
On the missile silo to make sure

41:30.260 --> 41:32.260
That the rockets come out as soon as possible

41:32.260 --> 41:34.260
Right through there

41:34.260 --> 41:36.260
You could also just

41:36.260 --> 41:38.260
Do it in little baggies do you have any like

41:38.260 --> 41:40.260
Zip lock baggies she was cheap

41:40.260 --> 41:42.260
She didn't want to buy things let's be clear

41:42.260 --> 41:44.260
People answer the question

41:44.260 --> 41:46.260
I don't think they let you just put loose fluid

41:46.260 --> 41:48.260
And zip lock baggies and bring it on airplanes

41:48.260 --> 41:50.260
I don't think you can

41:50.260 --> 41:52.260
Fucking do a makeshift capri sun

41:52.260 --> 41:54.260
And be like no no no it's cool

41:56.260 --> 41:58.260
Maybe like soak a towel in it

41:58.260 --> 42:00.260
And then wring it out when you get home

42:00.260 --> 42:02.260
Haha that's great

42:02.260 --> 42:04.260
The perfect crime

42:04.260 --> 42:06.260
Is it though

42:06.260 --> 42:08.260
Is it the right

42:08.260 --> 42:10.260
The problem with any solution here is you have to be

42:10.260 --> 42:12.260
Ready with an answer because you cannot

42:12.260 --> 42:14.260
Go to the screener and they say

42:14.260 --> 42:16.260
So what are these and you say well there's several

42:16.260 --> 42:18.260
Small baggies of lube

42:18.260 --> 42:20.260
I have many pistons at home

42:20.260 --> 42:22.260
Which I need to keep

42:22.260 --> 42:24.260
Working in their most efficient state

42:24.260 --> 42:26.260
They're sex pistons

42:26.260 --> 42:28.260
I hope we've helped

42:28.260 --> 42:30.260
Yes thank you very much

42:36.260 --> 42:38.260
Who else

42:38.260 --> 42:40.260
Elliot come on up

42:40.260 --> 42:42.260
Just complete silence

42:42.260 --> 42:44.260
Through the just no talking

42:46.260 --> 42:48.260
Namaste

42:48.260 --> 42:50.260
Hi Elliot from London

42:52.260 --> 42:54.260
So fancy

42:54.260 --> 42:56.260
Hey Elliot what's your

42:56.260 --> 42:58.260
What's your not bummer question

42:58.260 --> 43:00.260
So I have a flatmate

43:00.260 --> 43:02.260
He's a lovely lovely guy

43:02.260 --> 43:04.260
Remate

43:04.260 --> 43:06.260
I'm just translating for people I wasn't correcting

43:06.260 --> 43:08.260
Let's have one non completely

43:08.260 --> 43:10.260
Xenophobic show this year

43:10.260 --> 43:12.260
Who's afraid of Xena

43:12.260 --> 43:14.260
I've been sitting on that

43:14.260 --> 43:16.260
Joke for three years

43:18.260 --> 43:20.260
Oh god

43:22.260 --> 43:24.260
So he's a

43:24.260 --> 43:26.260
Lovely guy he's got a job just like I do

43:26.260 --> 43:28.260
Same wage and all the rest of it but

43:28.260 --> 43:30.260
It's like living with a

43:30.260 --> 43:32.260
Toddler that has a career

43:32.260 --> 43:34.260
In that he doesn't seem

43:34.260 --> 43:36.260
To understand the concept of

43:36.260 --> 43:38.260
You know cleanliness and

43:38.260 --> 43:40.260
Not leaving marks all over the walls

43:40.260 --> 43:42.260
And

43:42.260 --> 43:44.260
Wait a minute are we dealing with a

43:44.260 --> 43:46.260
Harold and the purple crayon situation

43:46.260 --> 43:48.260
Is he imagineering

43:48.260 --> 43:50.260
No he's sort of like

43:50.260 --> 43:52.260
The grubby marks around light switches

43:52.260 --> 43:54.260
And leaving stuff on camera

43:54.260 --> 43:56.260
Holy shit

43:56.260 --> 43:58.260
He's eating peanut butter with his hands

43:58.260 --> 44:00.260
Why are you rooming with pig pen

44:00.260 --> 44:02.260
The problem is I've known him

44:02.260 --> 44:04.260
Since we were 12 and I can't

44:04.260 --> 44:06.260
I can't sort of you know

44:06.260 --> 44:08.260
Leave him in the lurch and stuff like that

44:08.260 --> 44:10.260
Otherwise a lovely guy

44:10.260 --> 44:12.260
I've tried every sort of pleasant conversation

44:12.260 --> 44:14.260
That you can have with a lifelong best friend

44:14.260 --> 44:16.260
Without this sort of thing

44:16.260 --> 44:18.260
How do I get him to you know be an adult

44:18.260 --> 44:20.260
You could try cookie points

44:20.260 --> 44:22.260
Cookie points would be good

44:22.260 --> 44:24.260
Bath time points I guess

44:24.260 --> 44:26.260
Bath time vouchers

44:26.260 --> 44:28.260
They serve bath time vouchers in this magazine

44:28.260 --> 44:30.260
Ellie give me a sample like in the conversations

44:30.260 --> 44:32.260
You've had with him what's the tenor of those

44:32.260 --> 44:34.260
What's the general tone

44:34.260 --> 44:36.260
Well they've ranged

44:36.260 --> 44:38.260
Yeah right

44:38.260 --> 44:40.260
But generally it's along the lines of like you know

44:40.260 --> 44:42.260
If you clean things up now

44:42.260 --> 44:44.260
It will be easier than cleaning them later

44:44.260 --> 44:46.260
And I won't have to yell at you and try and be your mother

44:46.260 --> 44:48.260
You don't use that tone though

44:48.260 --> 44:50.260
I don't but that's what I'm thinking

44:50.260 --> 44:52.260
Did he have like when you were growing up

44:52.260 --> 44:54.260
Did he have a nickname like Grubby Hank

44:54.260 --> 44:56.260
This one's on you dog

44:56.260 --> 44:58.260
You don't live with Grubby Hank

44:58.260 --> 45:00.260
You go out and hang out at bars with Grubby Hank

45:00.260 --> 45:02.260
You don't bring him into your domicile

45:02.260 --> 45:04.260
His nickname was Scruff as a child

45:04.260 --> 45:06.260
Same principle

45:06.260 --> 45:08.260
But the cleanliness thing wasn't the thing

45:08.260 --> 45:10.260
Until I actually lived with him

45:10.260 --> 45:12.260
Oh no he just had a beard when he was a child

45:12.260 --> 45:14.260
Basically yeah

45:14.260 --> 45:16.260
You gotta move

45:16.260 --> 45:18.260
Don't move

45:18.260 --> 45:20.260
I'm rethinking it I was rash

45:20.260 --> 45:22.260
I'm sorry

45:22.260 --> 45:24.260
I mean

45:24.260 --> 45:26.260
You were his last shot you know that right

45:26.260 --> 45:28.260
Like his parents done fucked it

45:28.260 --> 45:30.260
Yeah that's done

45:30.260 --> 45:32.260
You were his last shot at having a normal life

45:32.260 --> 45:34.260
And you've gotta sit him down

45:34.260 --> 45:36.260
And grab

45:36.260 --> 45:38.260
Don't touch him

45:38.260 --> 45:40.260
I was gonna say grab his face

45:40.260 --> 45:42.260
And it's like oh is that jelly

45:42.260 --> 45:44.260
Did you put jelly on your face

45:44.260 --> 45:46.260
I keep little tubs of those

45:46.260 --> 45:48.260
You know those alcohol hand washes around

45:48.260 --> 45:50.260
Just because

45:50.260 --> 45:52.260
At like a barbecue restaurant you just hold on

45:52.260 --> 45:54.260
They're just everywhere

45:54.260 --> 45:56.260
Let me tell you

45:56.260 --> 45:58.260
People might not know this

45:58.260 --> 46:00.260
I'm kind of a messy person

46:00.260 --> 46:02.260
How the fuck would they know that

46:02.260 --> 46:04.260
They don't live with you Travis

46:04.260 --> 46:06.260
They know your fucking voice

46:06.260 --> 46:08.260
They don't know your mannerisms

46:08.260 --> 46:10.260
I'll post some pictures

46:10.260 --> 46:12.260
We rarely leave in the sound of you

46:12.260 --> 46:14.260
Tripping over a milk carton

46:14.260 --> 46:16.260
The argument if you clean it now

46:16.260 --> 46:18.260
It'll be easier than cleaning it later

46:18.260 --> 46:20.260
Is false because cleaning it later

46:20.260 --> 46:22.260
Is inherently easier because

46:22.260 --> 46:24.260
It never comes

46:24.260 --> 46:26.260
That's his entire attitude with everything in life

46:26.260 --> 46:28.260
And I don't know

46:28.260 --> 46:30.260
Have you considered leaning into it

46:30.260 --> 46:32.260
Getting super dirty yourself

46:32.260 --> 46:34.260
Getting on the British version of

46:34.260 --> 46:36.260
Hoarders whatever it's called over there

46:36.260 --> 46:38.260
Just shitting all over his bed

46:38.260 --> 46:40.260
Don't shit on his bed

46:40.260 --> 46:42.260
What the fuck

46:42.260 --> 46:44.260
You gotta think about mass

46:44.260 --> 46:46.260
And you gotta think about volume

46:46.260 --> 46:48.260
Hoarding is a volume game

46:48.260 --> 46:50.260
You wanna have stacks of shit

46:50.260 --> 46:52.260
Not shit shit

46:52.260 --> 46:54.260
And then the money that you get

46:54.260 --> 46:56.260
From being on Hoarders

46:56.260 --> 46:58.260
You can buy a maid or a nanny

47:00.260 --> 47:02.260
I don't think they pay people to be on Hoarders

47:02.260 --> 47:04.260
Yeah if you're on Hoarders

47:04.260 --> 47:06.260
They pay you like a Hoarders stipend

47:06.260 --> 47:08.260
Get like an appearance fee

47:08.260 --> 47:10.260
They look at you and say

47:10.260 --> 47:12.260
Don't spend it all on crackerjack paraphernalia

47:12.260 --> 47:14.260
Boink

47:14.260 --> 47:16.260
Do you think that the

47:16.260 --> 47:18.260
Hoarders guardian angels that come in

47:18.260 --> 47:20.260
They're just like oh yeah your shit's super fucked up

47:20.260 --> 47:22.260
Later bye

47:22.260 --> 47:24.260
Have fun with your whole situation here

47:24.260 --> 47:26.260
I think a good twist on Hoarders

47:26.260 --> 47:28.260
Would be if they left all their stuff together

47:28.260 --> 47:30.260
In a specific location

47:30.260 --> 47:32.260
And then gave them a clue

47:32.260 --> 47:34.260
And then it turned into like the Amazing Race

47:34.260 --> 47:36.260
You can get it all back

47:36.260 --> 47:38.260
It's all waiting for you

47:38.260 --> 47:40.260
Whatever you do make it fun

47:42.260 --> 47:44.260
Round of applause

47:46.260 --> 47:48.260
How we doing on time?

47:48.260 --> 47:50.260
What?

47:50.260 --> 47:52.260
We're doing good

47:52.260 --> 47:54.260
Who else has a question?

47:54.260 --> 47:56.260
Oh wait hold on

47:56.260 --> 47:58.260
Let's do a Yahoo answer

47:58.260 --> 48:00.260
Let's drop in and just

48:00.260 --> 48:02.260
Remember my password

48:02.260 --> 48:04.260
This Yahoo answer was

48:04.260 --> 48:06.260
Sent in by Christa Whalen

48:06.260 --> 48:08.260
Thank you Christa Whalen

48:08.260 --> 48:10.260
It's by Yahoo answer's user Janine who asks

48:10.260 --> 48:12.260
Financial aid at Hogwarts?

48:12.260 --> 48:14.260
Does Hogwarts provide financial aid?

48:14.260 --> 48:16.260
Or do I need to submit the wizard

48:16.260 --> 48:18.260
Equivalent of the FAFSA?

48:20.260 --> 48:22.260
So this raises some legitimate questions

48:22.260 --> 48:24.260
I think if you don't have financial aid

48:24.260 --> 48:26.260
At Hogwarts it's gonna create

48:26.260 --> 48:28.260
Sort of like a class warfare

48:28.260 --> 48:30.260
It's just a rich get more magical

48:30.260 --> 48:32.260
You know situation

48:32.260 --> 48:34.260
It's you gotta have financial

48:34.260 --> 48:36.260
Like I imagine they never really touch on this

48:36.260 --> 48:38.260
In the books or the movies

48:38.260 --> 48:40.260
But I imagine it's an expensive institution

48:40.260 --> 48:42.260
It's a fucking castle

48:42.260 --> 48:44.260
Right

48:44.260 --> 48:46.260
Most castle based schools require

48:46.260 --> 48:48.260
A large sum of money

48:48.260 --> 48:50.260
I'm gonna ask you guys a question

48:50.260 --> 48:52.260
I've been wondering for a while

48:52.260 --> 48:54.260
It's slightly off topic

48:54.260 --> 48:56.260
Perfect

48:56.260 --> 48:58.260
There has to be one Slytherin kid

48:58.260 --> 49:00.260
Who's like cool

49:00.260 --> 49:02.260
Who's like nice

49:02.260 --> 49:04.260
Who's sitting there in the conference room

49:04.260 --> 49:06.260
Just be like you guys are dicks

49:06.260 --> 49:08.260
Harry's okay

49:08.260 --> 49:10.260
The four house based system

49:10.260 --> 49:12.260
Of Hogwarts

49:12.260 --> 49:14.260
Creates it's own class warfare

49:14.260 --> 49:16.260
In and of itself

49:16.260 --> 49:18.260
You got the one percenters in Slytherin

49:18.260 --> 49:20.260
You got the

49:20.260 --> 49:22.260
I just don't know what the Hufflepuff people are up to

49:22.260 --> 49:24.260
They're just a bunch of fat babies

49:24.260 --> 49:26.260
That's all I can think of

49:26.260 --> 49:28.260
When I think of Hufflepuff I just imagine fat babies

49:28.260 --> 49:30.260
Waddling around doing magic

49:30.260 --> 49:32.260
You know why are there only humans

49:32.260 --> 49:34.260
Another terrific point

49:34.260 --> 49:36.260
There are only humans going to Hogwarts

49:36.260 --> 49:38.260
We know that this world is populated by several different races

49:38.260 --> 49:40.260
Intelligent races

49:40.260 --> 49:42.260
Intelligent races

49:42.260 --> 49:44.260
There are fucking centaurs in the fucking backyard

49:44.260 --> 49:46.260
Like hey guys can we get some magic too

49:46.260 --> 49:48.260
And it's like yeah that'll be 200

49:48.260 --> 49:50.260
Currency

49:50.260 --> 49:52.260
200,000

49:52.260 --> 49:54.260
Knots

49:54.260 --> 49:56.260
I think

49:56.260 --> 49:58.260
Zenny

49:58.260 --> 50:00.260
You're welcome

50:00.260 --> 50:02.260
You know there was one ogre

50:02.260 --> 50:04.260
There was one ogre kid that got admitted

50:04.260 --> 50:06.260
And just like

50:06.260 --> 50:08.260
Tried to pick up a beaker of magic

50:08.260 --> 50:10.260
And smashed it in his hands

50:10.260 --> 50:12.260
Nevermind I'll see myself out

50:12.260 --> 50:14.260
I'll walk through the wall

50:14.260 --> 50:16.260
I'll telecommute

50:20.260 --> 50:22.260
I'll just go to Hogwarts online

50:22.260 --> 50:24.260
Hogwarts online

50:24.260 --> 50:26.260
Oh man what a bummer that would be

50:26.260 --> 50:28.260
Like oh shit

50:28.260 --> 50:30.260
There was a fucking

50:30.260 --> 50:32.260
This crazy wild troll got out

50:32.260 --> 50:34.260
There was a fucking

50:34.260 --> 50:36.260
The second wizarding war

50:36.260 --> 50:38.260
You missed some shit man

50:38.260 --> 50:40.260
No I was eating this hot pocket though

50:40.260 --> 50:42.260
Gmail servers went down and I missed my final

50:42.260 --> 50:44.260
It's like literal

50:44.260 --> 50:46.260
Phoenix University

50:50.260 --> 50:52.260
Cause magic

50:52.260 --> 50:54.260
Alright let's help somebody else

50:54.260 --> 51:02.260
Help you

51:02.260 --> 51:04.260
I apologize for sweating through

51:04.260 --> 51:06.260
The shirt I'm wearing

51:06.260 --> 51:08.260
It's hot up in this comedy lodge

51:08.260 --> 51:10.260
Are you apologizing to me? Yes specifically

51:10.260 --> 51:12.260
Hi I'm Sarah

51:12.260 --> 51:14.260
Hi Sarah I'm Justin

51:14.260 --> 51:16.260
I just got a new job that's work from home

51:16.260 --> 51:18.260
And I was wondering if you had any advice on

51:18.260 --> 51:20.260
How to do that

51:20.260 --> 51:22.260
Sister if you can figure it out

51:22.260 --> 51:24.260
Let me know

51:24.260 --> 51:26.260
Can you afford to hire six to eight people

51:26.260 --> 51:28.260
To just be around you

51:28.260 --> 51:30.260
I've been working out of my home

51:30.260 --> 51:32.260
For

51:32.260 --> 51:34.260
Four years now

51:34.260 --> 51:36.260
Just my home

51:36.260 --> 51:38.260
It's just me and my cats

51:38.260 --> 51:40.260
And your wife

51:40.260 --> 51:42.260
And my wife

51:42.260 --> 51:44.260
Well no I mean during the day

51:44.260 --> 51:46.260
I pay someone

51:46.260 --> 51:48.260
I pay someone to clean the house

51:48.260 --> 51:50.260
Just so I have visitors

51:52.260 --> 51:54.260
FedEx man is my best friend

51:54.260 --> 51:56.260
Get okay

51:56.260 --> 51:58.260
And get your boss okay

51:58.260 --> 52:00.260
With the fact that your first year

52:00.260 --> 52:02.260
You're not going to do very good

52:02.260 --> 52:04.260
You're going to do a super bad job

52:04.260 --> 52:06.260
At your job

52:06.260 --> 52:08.260
All the things you like are at your house

52:08.260 --> 52:10.260
They're right there and most importantly

52:10.260 --> 52:12.260
Your sleep zone

52:12.260 --> 52:14.260
The place where you do all your sleeping at

52:14.260 --> 52:16.260
Yeah it's a rough

52:16.260 --> 52:18.260
It's a rough transition and it really did

52:18.260 --> 52:20.260
Take me like a year and a half before I was

52:20.260 --> 52:22.260
Meeting my quotas so to speak

52:22.260 --> 52:24.260
Structure is really important

52:24.260 --> 52:26.260
I know it seems like well done with pants

52:26.260 --> 52:28.260
But you really

52:28.260 --> 52:30.260
You got to set a pants schedule

52:30.260 --> 52:32.260
You do have to set a pants schedule

52:32.260 --> 52:34.260
There's a primordial gene inside of you that's like

52:34.260 --> 52:36.260
I don't have pants on so just fuck it

52:36.260 --> 52:38.260
Let's watch a whole season

52:38.260 --> 52:40.260
Of the amazing race today

52:40.260 --> 52:42.260
I can't even wear sweatpants

52:42.260 --> 52:44.260
Because they send a signal

52:44.260 --> 52:46.260
To my brain that's like take it easy brother

52:46.260 --> 52:48.260
That song 5 o'clock

52:48.260 --> 52:50.260
Somewhere is about me putting on sweatpants actually

52:52.260 --> 52:54.260
Love his music

52:54.260 --> 52:56.260
So do bad for a year wear pants

52:56.260 --> 52:58.260
I'm not saying do bad for a year

52:58.260 --> 53:00.260
I'm saying you have no other option

53:00.260 --> 53:02.260
It's a really tough transition

53:02.260 --> 53:04.260
What do you do?

53:04.260 --> 53:06.260
No that's fine actually

53:06.260 --> 53:08.260
My employer is here too

53:08.260 --> 53:10.260
Oh fuck

53:10.260 --> 53:12.260
I always knew someday

53:12.260 --> 53:14.260
The advice would come back

53:14.260 --> 53:16.260
Circus closed

53:16.260 --> 53:18.260
What is your job?

53:18.260 --> 53:20.260
So I work for Make That Thing

53:20.260 --> 53:22.260
Which is a subsidiary of Topataco

53:22.260 --> 53:24.260
Okay

53:24.260 --> 53:26.260
I imagine that most people there

53:26.260 --> 53:28.260
Work from home unless there's a

53:28.260 --> 53:30.260
Is there a centralized office for

53:30.260 --> 53:32.260
There is but it's in another state

53:32.260 --> 53:34.260
From the one I live in

53:34.260 --> 53:36.260
Are there a lot of remote employees

53:36.260 --> 53:38.260
Or are you more or less

53:38.260 --> 53:40.260
Will they notice that you're

53:40.260 --> 53:42.260
Not wearing pants?

53:42.260 --> 53:44.260
They haven't noticed yet

53:44.260 --> 53:46.260
Nice

53:46.260 --> 53:48.260
There's a robot

53:48.260 --> 53:50.260
That's at the hospital in my town

53:50.260 --> 53:52.260
That has a

53:52.260 --> 53:54.260
This is the beginning of my favorite

53:54.260 --> 53:56.260
Tom Waits song

53:56.260 --> 53:58.260
There's a robot

53:58.260 --> 54:00.260
That lives in the hospital

54:00.260 --> 54:02.260
Near my town

54:02.260 --> 54:04.260
There's a robot that lives

54:04.260 --> 54:06.260
In the hospital near my town

54:06.260 --> 54:08.260
And he has a

54:08.260 --> 54:10.260
He has a TV screen

54:10.260 --> 54:12.260
On his face that is his face

54:12.260 --> 54:14.260
That's his face and there's a doctor

54:14.260 --> 54:16.260
I'm not making

54:16.260 --> 54:18.260
I'm so excited to see where you go with this

54:18.260 --> 54:20.260
This isn't a joke

54:20.260 --> 54:22.260
It was on a commercial I saw

54:22.260 --> 54:24.260
There's a

54:24.260 --> 54:26.260
There's a doctor that lives

54:26.260 --> 54:28.260
The doctor's on the TV

54:28.260 --> 54:30.260
And he rolls into your room

54:30.260 --> 54:32.260
And he has robot arms

54:32.260 --> 54:34.260
And everything is a robot except his face

54:34.260 --> 54:36.260
It's still a robot

54:36.260 --> 54:38.260
It's a remote robot face Justin

54:38.260 --> 54:40.260
You know it's not his actual

54:40.260 --> 54:42.260
It's not his actual face

54:42.260 --> 54:44.260
Pulled in a ghastly manner

54:44.260 --> 54:46.260
Over

54:46.260 --> 54:48.260
Does he have a pill dispenser?

54:48.260 --> 54:50.260
No? I made that up

54:50.260 --> 54:52.260
It's like a

54:52.260 --> 54:54.260
It's like a gashapon machine

54:54.260 --> 54:56.260
You put in a quarter and maybe you get the

54:56.260 --> 54:58.260
Maybe you get the treatment you need

54:58.260 --> 55:00.260
So he does have a pill dispenser

55:00.260 --> 55:02.260
I'll edit that out when she said that he doesn't

55:02.260 --> 55:04.260
And you could

55:04.260 --> 55:06.260
I guess what I'm saying is maybe do that

55:08.260 --> 55:10.260
Which part?

55:10.260 --> 55:12.260
Good question

55:12.260 --> 55:14.260
That is going to be

55:14.260 --> 55:16.260
I imagine there's a lot of pranksters in that office

55:16.260 --> 55:18.260
And when you're not there to fend those pranksters off

55:18.260 --> 55:20.260
And all you have are robot appendages

55:20.260 --> 55:22.260
Oh yeah they're going to TP you

55:22.260 --> 55:24.260
And you won't realize it because you only have the one camera

55:24.260 --> 55:26.260
Guys be honest

55:26.260 --> 55:28.260
Am I covered in toilet paper right now?

55:28.260 --> 55:30.260
You will have robot

55:30.260 --> 55:32.260
Which model of robot you get

55:32.260 --> 55:34.260
If you get a terminator robot

55:36.260 --> 55:38.260
Then what?

55:38.260 --> 55:40.260
Is there a rest of the goof?

55:40.260 --> 55:42.260
No that would be terrific

55:42.260 --> 55:44.260
Dangerous and kind of scary

55:44.260 --> 55:46.260
What about a Johnny 5 robot?

55:48.260 --> 55:50.260
What about an iron giant? How big is the office?

55:50.260 --> 55:52.260
That would work

55:52.260 --> 55:54.260
It's a fucking big office

55:54.260 --> 55:56.260
You guys are doing pretty great

55:56.260 --> 56:00.260
Vacation request

56:04.260 --> 56:08.260
Softball sign ups in the break room

56:10.260 --> 56:12.260
Aye supervisor

56:12.260 --> 56:14.260
Supervisor

56:16.260 --> 56:18.260
I'm going to start crying

56:18.260 --> 56:20.260
I'm going to cry too

56:20.260 --> 56:22.260
He just wants to be a hero

56:22.260 --> 56:26.260
He just wants to be in charge of some employees

56:26.260 --> 56:28.260
Did any of that help?

56:28.260 --> 56:30.260
Oh it was great

56:34.260 --> 56:36.260
No you fucking dropped the mic

56:36.260 --> 56:38.260
That was a baller move

56:38.260 --> 56:40.260
Put DMX back on

56:40.260 --> 56:42.260
Play it off

56:42.260 --> 56:44.260
I think we have time for maybe one more

56:44.260 --> 56:46.260
One more person needs help

56:46.260 --> 56:48.260
That's Joe Dan right here

56:48.260 --> 56:50.260
Come up to the stage

56:50.260 --> 56:52.260
Quicker

56:52.260 --> 56:54.260
I like that

56:54.260 --> 56:56.260
Cut across

56:56.260 --> 56:58.260
Oh flavor

56:58.260 --> 57:00.260
I like your style Dan

57:00.260 --> 57:02.260
What's your name?

57:02.260 --> 57:04.260
Holy shit that was amazing

57:04.260 --> 57:06.260
How did you?

57:06.260 --> 57:08.260
Raise your hand if your name is Dan here

57:08.260 --> 57:10.260
So your odds were pretty good

57:10.260 --> 57:12.260
Bad

57:12.260 --> 57:14.260
All the smokers are Dan

57:14.260 --> 57:16.260
I'm smoker Dan

57:16.260 --> 57:18.260
My friends call me

57:18.260 --> 57:20.260
What's your story smoker Dan?

57:20.260 --> 57:22.260
I recently moved in with a friend of mine

57:22.260 --> 57:24.260
Is he really dirty?

57:24.260 --> 57:26.260
Because we just did this one

57:26.260 --> 57:28.260
Actually I was going to ask a question related to that

57:28.260 --> 57:30.260
Because I'm on vacation

57:30.260 --> 57:32.260
And I don't know how to keep my house clean

57:32.260 --> 57:34.260
When I'm not there

57:34.260 --> 57:36.260
Because he doesn't do it when I am there

57:36.260 --> 57:38.260
But no that wasn't

57:38.260 --> 57:40.260
We've done that

57:40.260 --> 57:42.260
Wow I like this pivot

57:42.260 --> 57:44.260
We should learn how to do this

57:44.260 --> 57:46.260
Days after moving in

57:46.260 --> 57:48.260
He had a falling out

57:48.260 --> 57:50.260
With all of our mutual friends

57:50.260 --> 57:52.260
Can I ask what he did?

57:52.260 --> 57:54.260
Was it so much of a dick move

57:54.260 --> 57:56.260
That you don't even want to

57:56.260 --> 57:58.260
I have no idea

57:58.260 --> 58:00.260
It's a simple mystery

58:00.260 --> 58:02.260
Sounds actually pretty

58:02.260 --> 58:04.260
If only you could ask somebody

58:08.260 --> 58:10.260
There has to be some material witness

58:10.260 --> 58:12.260
Time to look for clues

58:12.260 --> 58:14.260
The way he says it

58:14.260 --> 58:16.260
It was the thing

58:16.260 --> 58:18.260
That finally happened

58:18.260 --> 58:20.260
I don't know what the thing is

58:20.260 --> 58:22.260
My question was really

58:22.260 --> 58:24.260
How do I go about maintaining those

58:24.260 --> 58:26.260
Other relationships

58:26.260 --> 58:28.260
Dan there is no reality in which we can answer this

58:28.260 --> 58:30.260
Without more insight into what the action was

58:30.260 --> 58:32.260
That you were trying to defend

58:32.260 --> 58:34.260
What if he killed a guy?

58:34.260 --> 58:36.260
The only story

58:36.260 --> 58:38.260
He's told me is

58:38.260 --> 58:40.260
Him and his friend

58:40.260 --> 58:42.260
They had a podcast

58:42.260 --> 58:44.260
I already fucking despise this

58:44.260 --> 58:46.260
Fuck them where do they get off?

58:48.260 --> 58:50.260
If you plug the podcast in

58:50.260 --> 58:52.260
I'm not going to say it

58:52.260 --> 58:54.260
Jordan and Jesse go

58:58.260 --> 59:00.260
They were doing a movie review

59:00.260 --> 59:02.260
Of Iron Man 3

59:04.260 --> 59:06.260
They disagreed and it turned into

59:06.260 --> 59:08.260
A life fight

59:08.260 --> 59:10.260
Are you fucking kidding me?

59:10.260 --> 59:12.260
We've all been there

59:14.260 --> 59:16.260
It's a fickle thing

59:16.260 --> 59:18.260
That I have a hard time

59:18.260 --> 59:20.260
Taking seriously

59:20.260 --> 59:22.260
Because it's dumb

59:22.260 --> 59:24.260
All of my friends are fighting

59:24.260 --> 59:26.260
Can I give you some advice that I haven't given in a while?

59:26.260 --> 59:28.260
You need to pack your bags and move the fuck away

59:28.260 --> 59:30.260
Because this whole group of friends

59:30.260 --> 59:32.260
Sounds eight

59:32.260 --> 59:34.260
They have that quality

59:34.260 --> 59:36.260
He said mean things about Iron Man 3

59:36.260 --> 59:38.260
Hey, come on now

59:38.260 --> 59:40.260
I haven't seen it yet

59:46.260 --> 59:48.260
If that was really the

59:48.260 --> 59:50.260
Realistically

59:50.260 --> 59:52.260
That's what your roommate is telling you

59:52.260 --> 59:54.260
And the other ones are like

59:54.260 --> 59:56.260
He shit on my bed

59:56.260 --> 59:58.260
Did he say he didn't like Iron Man 3

59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.260
Because it had black people in it?

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.260
Because that would be

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.260
Cause to say

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.260
I don't think I want to be friends with this dude anymore

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.260
There may have been subtext

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.260
I like Iron Man in that movie

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.260
He reminds me of your dad who I had sex with

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.260
I disagree

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.260
He does not remind me of my dad

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.260
People ask me how to build an audience

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.260
For their podcast

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.260
That would be the best fucking episode of anything ever

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.260
Just let it roll

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.260
Just let it play

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.260
Watch it all crumble around you

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.260
Yeah, all new friends

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.260
Start over

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.260
You're young, you got a lot of time to rebuild

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.260
It's a rebuilding year for you, Dan

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.260
I guess that's how I ended up here

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.260
We got bad news this year, but great news next year

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.260
You're gonna feel great

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.260
You made a bunch of new friends here, so you're gonna be fine

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.260
Move in with them

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.260
Who's got room for Dan?

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.260
There's one hand

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.260
How many people do you need to live with, Dan?

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:02.260
Round of applause for Dan

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:10.260
Alright, that's all the proper advice questions

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.260
Yeah, that's all the proper advice we have

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.260
Before we wrap this show up

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.260
In the only way we know how

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.260
We want to say thank you so much

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:22.260
Seriously, this is even earlier than we did it last year

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.260
Which was still pretty early

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.260
And I know you guys had super late nights

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.260
Behind the curtain

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.260
It felt like a lot of people were up really late last night

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.260
Saw a lot of auras

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.260
Thank you guys, seriously, for coming

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.260
And thank you to all of the other

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.260
Presenters and performers and everyone this year

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.260
Let's do one big round of applause for everyone

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.260
And now one just for us

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.260
I can't applaud

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.260
For people that have sent me to a

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.260
Three day panic attack

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.260
And I'm confronted by genuinely talented people

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.260
Oh, he's like really funny

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.260
He has jokes and things, oh shit

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.260
Oh god, oh god

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.260
He's worked at this, ah shit

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.260
So last year we

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.260
Closed the show out with a bunch of

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.260
Final yahoo questions

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.260
Layered delicately

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.260
So delicately

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.260
Over Vanessa Williams

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.260
Saved the best for last

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.260
We're not going to do that this year

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.260
No, we're doing something incredibly similar though

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.260
We are going to

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:26.260
Read the final yahoo answers

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.260
Yeah Nick, if you want to go ahead

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.260
Over the best last day of camp song

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.260
Possibly of all time

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.260
Should we stand up? Can we take these out of the thing?

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.260
I don't think we can take them out of the thing, we can try

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.260
They move

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.260
That's awkward

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.260
Should I start?

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.260
Go ahead

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.260
Do you have to mentally add the prices

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.260
If you work at Subway?

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.260
What do you think of the idea of people

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.260
Evolving like Pokemon?

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.260
Can spiders have fun?

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.260
Is it possible to break your

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.260
Titty bone?

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.260
Is it possible to break your

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.260
Titty bone?

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:16.260
Is the movie Jumanji based on a true story?

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.260
Are a kangaroo's fingers flexible enough

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.260
To pick up a can or a magazine?

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.260
Why don't we go

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.260
Does the Pringles guy remind you of Frederick Nishi?

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.260
Nishi

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.260
Notice there are no photos of

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.260
Notice there are no photos of Jesus with a hat?

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.260
Think about it

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.260
Two and two, add it up

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.260
Where can I find Gordon Ramsay fan fiction?

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.260
What is the opposite of being a gynecologist?

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:58.260
How much does Africa cost?

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.260
How do I tell my parents that I am a horse?

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.260
If you have a gun rack on your bike

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.260
Then you might be a redneck

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.260
I was washing my car

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.260
And my neighbour came out and said

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.260
Washing your car huh?

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.260
Billing ball

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.260
I said nope, just watering my jeep garden

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.260
Here's your sign

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.260
Ladies and gentlemen

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.260
Get her done

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.260
I am Justin McElroy, wear the blue collar

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.260
This has been my brother, my brother and me

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.260
Kiss your dad's square on the lips

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:52.260
Music
