WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.800
Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, and like, I think it was, it was a deep cut. That would

00:50.800 --> 00:56.160
be like episode 38, I think? It was back there. No, it was like episode like three.

00:56.160 --> 01:03.280
It was like episode negative eight. We have, as promised, the godfather of

01:05.360 --> 01:12.240
deep singing rock music. It's soul, I guess. It's soulful. Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12.960 --> 01:19.040
Mr. Tom Waits. Hey, everybody. Really, really nice to be here. Thank you. Now, Tom? Yeah.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.200
First of all, how the fuck did you hear about this show? Because you're like super famous

01:25.200 --> 01:31.840
and busy all the time. Right. Well, when I was, when I was playing the role of the engineer in

01:31.840 --> 01:38.480
a film called The Book of Eli with Mr. Denzel Washington, he said- A fellow deep voicer.

01:39.200 --> 01:44.720
Another deep voice fellow. He said to me, there's going to be a podcast that's going to start in a

01:44.720 --> 01:52.240
few months, and you are really going to want to get into it. Well, let's explain, because before

01:52.240 --> 01:57.920
we did this as an independent venture, we tried to get it greenlit at Denzel Washington's independent

01:57.920 --> 02:06.000
film studio. The movies of Eli. It's just called Denzel. Denzel. Right. And he said, Justin, there's

02:06.000 --> 02:13.920
going to be an advice show for the modern era. There's going to be three brothers, basically.

02:13.920 --> 02:19.280
They're going to take people's questions and they're going to turn them into wisdom. He said,

02:19.280 --> 02:23.360
it'll be like alchemy. And I said, that's a good line. You should send it to him. Yeah. Everything

02:23.360 --> 02:27.440
we say on this show, if you think it's funny, just send a thank you letter to Denzel Washington.

02:27.440 --> 02:33.040
He said it was- Which you should be doing anyways. Yeah. You should. Yeah. Just to tell him that you

02:33.040 --> 02:39.200
appreciate him. Thomas, can we get a, maybe a few bars of your favorite song that you did?

02:40.800 --> 02:46.880
You have any requests in particular? How about The Moon and the Devil and the Whiskey Bottle

02:46.880 --> 02:57.440
makes three. Okay, here we go. Can I see you tonight on a downtown train? Every night,

02:57.440 --> 03:06.240
every night is just the same on a downtown train. That's good. That was beautiful. Thanks. God,

03:06.800 --> 03:13.520
so full. You've still got, you've still got it. And by it, I mean, just like upsettingly,

03:13.520 --> 03:17.680
like the devil's voice. You basically have the devil's voice and you, but you still have it.

03:18.400 --> 03:24.240
Well, thanks. You know, it's a, it's a kind of love it or hate it type thing. You know, a critic

03:24.240 --> 03:28.480
by the name of Daniel Derscholes once said, it sounded like it was soaked in Nevada bourbon,

03:28.480 --> 03:32.720
left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car.

03:32.720 --> 03:39.200
So that's kind of what, good line I always thought. Hey guys, April Fools.

03:39.200 --> 03:45.840
Oh, you were waiting. I know you all were waiting for our goof and our spoof and this was it.

03:47.360 --> 03:54.480
What do you mean? You're not, you're not really Tom Waits. I sound like Tom Waits. You do.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.720
But that, I mean, I, you're not the person that you sound like. Right. To make it clear though,

04:00.720 --> 04:10.960
that was a goof of necessity. Yeah. Really? Mother Necessity is the inventor of all good goofs and

04:10.960 --> 04:20.880
spoofs. Electricity was originally a goof. Gotcha. He wanted to shock somebody in the tuchus.

04:20.880 --> 04:26.400
Hold this kite with your butt. Pranked him. Hold this butt kite. I'm going to shock you in the

04:26.400 --> 04:30.880
tuchus. Put this, put this key in your anus. I'm going to shock you. Put this key in your butt

04:30.880 --> 04:36.400
for science. Justin, what happened to you? Cause it does sound like your voice got hit by a car.

04:38.320 --> 04:44.320
I, I got a cold. I can happen. I'm human. No one gave me advice not to get a cold. That's

04:44.320 --> 04:50.160
one of the hazards of having your own show. You guys though, I got to tell you guys, you're lucky

04:50.160 --> 04:57.680
you caught me this early to record because as soon as this show's over, I am going to take a bunch

04:57.680 --> 05:03.200
of texts from a Thor fan. I'm going to get really high and I'm going to watch, uh, Twin Peaks just

05:03.200 --> 05:08.080
in like a marathon. Don't do that. The original idea that I had was instead of being Tom, Tom

05:08.080 --> 05:15.600
Waits, I wanted to be the weird dwarf. We live in a land filled with music. Well, that's been a great,

05:15.600 --> 05:20.080
that's been a dream of yours for a long time, hasn't it? Like you've been wanting to do that

05:20.080 --> 05:28.480
for a while now. This is my cousin. She looks like Glora Balmer. Can I, can I be the log lady?

05:28.480 --> 05:31.920
Yeah. Hey, what's up everyone? 1989.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.880
Reagan did a great job. I thought just came out on Netflix and sync queue. That means it basically

05:40.880 --> 05:46.560
just came out. Finally, people can see Twin Peaks. Uh, we weren't old enough to watch it the first

05:46.560 --> 05:51.120
time. Hey, uh, let's answer some questions. What do you think? Okay. All right. Get balls deep.

05:51.840 --> 05:57.040
Griffin, I'm going to ask that you take over the question asking for this to preserve what's left

05:57.040 --> 06:03.440
of my dainty pipes. Okay. People are gonna learn that I'm not a good, like the strongest reader.

06:03.440 --> 06:10.480
You know, I could, I could maybe read a couple now. All right, Travis, go ahead. No, no, no, no.

06:10.480 --> 06:16.080
Travis is right. He's right. Okay. Kill it. Brothers. There's this nice bike. Nope. Stop.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.400
Stop, stop, stop. No, no, no, no, no. So close your inflection thing. Thank you for the opportunity.

06:20.960 --> 06:27.520
You sound, you sound like you're talking down to the question. Well, okay. Then you do it.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.640
I don't know. I want you to really just give it your all. I want you to do it. I just want you

06:30.640 --> 06:36.960
to do it. Not shitty brothers. There's this nice bike that's been changed to a pole by my job since

06:36.960 --> 06:42.400
October. It's remained unmoved through several snowstorms, hail, rain, and all other bad weather.

06:42.400 --> 06:48.480
I want it. I haven't seen any signs of an owner and I even left my forwarding address on the seat,

06:48.480 --> 06:53.680
but got no response. Would it be terrible if I just clipped the chain and outright took it?

06:53.680 --> 07:00.080
It's starting to rust and that comes from the urban Robin Hood. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't.

07:00.080 --> 07:05.440
It doesn't come from urban Robin Hood. Robin Hood didn't steal from the missing and keep for himself.

07:05.440 --> 07:12.240
I steal from the absent and keep it. And give to the me.

07:14.320 --> 07:21.200
Um, I, why do you want a bike, dog? Hey, what's up? Public transit not good enough for you?

07:23.520 --> 07:27.520
I think that this is like an age. I have this problem all the time when I'm like stuck at a

07:27.520 --> 07:33.760
really lengthy red light and there's no one around. There's no other cars in no way. Is this like

07:33.760 --> 07:39.200
a threatening a traffic accident? And I'm like, I could just go. This isn't going to bother anyone.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.480
This is a victimless crime. Yeah. Is what you're saying. Except for the victim of the guy who has

07:44.480 --> 07:51.440
the bike. It has been months. It's been sitting there since October. Oh, since October. Yeah,

07:51.440 --> 07:57.200
that was just an eyesore. Yeah. Is it possible that this is an art installation? You have to be

07:57.200 --> 08:01.440
so careful these days. So careful these days. Half of the things you see on the street are

08:01.440 --> 08:06.000
art installations. And I think there's an equally good chance. It's an angel test.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.760
Oh my God. Half of the things you see on the street are art installations. The other half

08:11.760 --> 08:16.960
angel tests. Never. They don't ever, they don't ever meet. They're never, they don't ever,

08:16.960 --> 08:22.080
if they meet the world will end. That's true. Um, I, uh, I think that if you want the bike

08:22.080 --> 08:26.960
and you're going to put it to good use, take it. Just chain like a note. This is like,

08:26.960 --> 08:31.920
I'm sorry, I stole your shit. I owe you one bike. Here's where the bike is. Come get it.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.440
Did somebody maybe, somebody maybe park it there. Maybe somebody had a few

08:35.440 --> 08:41.040
drinks. Some they're riding their bike. Is that legal? I think you can operate a bike.

08:41.040 --> 08:46.240
As long as it doesn't have a motor on it. Right? Okay. Anyway, they're drunk. I'm biking.

08:47.120 --> 08:52.480
There's, there's Denny's workplace. I'm going to chain it up right there and walk the rest of the

08:52.480 --> 08:58.400
way home. Wakes up the next morning. Dude, where's my bike? I don't know. Hey, why don't you take the

08:58.400 --> 09:03.600
bike, but put an ad on Craigslist that says, I got your bike. Got your bike. If you want it, come

09:03.600 --> 09:09.280
talk to me about it. Run, tell that. Come tell me about your bike and I'll, if your bike matches

09:09.280 --> 09:15.600
this bike, I'll give you this bike. It is covered in decals now, but you can have it back. It's

09:15.600 --> 09:21.600
tricked out and I did, I took it off some ramps. So just keep that in mind. I hope you like snakes.

09:21.600 --> 09:27.840
It's now used to adrenaline. Your bike is hooked on adrenaline. I hooked your bike on dread because I

09:27.840 --> 09:34.320
I've been taking off so many ramps and, and half pipes. That's an old wise bike. I feel bad for

09:34.320 --> 09:41.360
that bike. Bikes aren't, a bike chained to a pole is safe, but that's not what bikes are for. They're

09:41.360 --> 09:49.120
for sweet ramps and sweet snake decals. Yep. And deliveries. Man, I want a bike. Yeah, I'll get you

09:49.120 --> 09:56.640
I'll get you one. Don't worry. This next question comes from Miss Molly May 12. That was good.

09:56.640 --> 10:02.640
You'll find it. Yeah. And the question is, how do you act around a guy friend who you just rejected?

10:05.120 --> 10:12.000
Uh, absent. You act like you're not around him. See, I'm going to say, I'm going to say victorious.

10:12.000 --> 10:19.040
You wear his shame, like some sort of, some sort of belt, like some sort of championship belt. You've

10:19.040 --> 10:24.400
bested him in the field of love. Yeah. In the game of love, he basically forfeit. Like that was the

10:24.400 --> 10:30.560
equivalent of like killing him with the first strike before he even got a couple swings in.

10:30.560 --> 10:36.240
It's his fault. Cause he fucked up. Cause he read the situation so bad. It's like, Oh, Miss Molly May,

10:36.240 --> 10:43.200
she gave me half of her snack pack the other day. Snack pack? Yeah. She gave me half of it

10:43.200 --> 10:48.640
and it was good. So she must love me. Like she must love me. There's no doubt about that. She

10:48.640 --> 10:55.760
gave me half of her Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. So like she's down to fuck. I know this. I know

10:55.760 --> 11:02.080
this thing. That is actually a good tip. Uh, if you could stop doing whatever you're doing,

11:02.080 --> 11:07.440
that is actually a good tip. Uh, if you could stop doing whatever slutty thing made him think

11:07.440 --> 11:13.760
you were a DTF, that would probably help. Is that it? Or is this guy a psychopath? And like,

11:13.760 --> 11:19.360
she made him a friendship bracelet in fourth grade and he's like, Oh, still into it. Gonna have that.

11:20.160 --> 11:28.000
Don't. You don't owe this guy shit. You beat him. Justin, I, I couldn't tell if you were

11:28.000 --> 11:32.400
joking or not because you've lost all inflection somewhere in your gravel pit of a voice. But

11:33.440 --> 11:39.760
I think you're right. Like about the being absent thing. I don't think there is a good way to

11:39.760 --> 11:44.800
interact with this dude after you've broken his tiny pitiful heart. I think you just need to walk

11:44.800 --> 11:50.160
away for a while and then come back and be like, Hey, are we cool now? Are we gonna start? No,

11:50.160 --> 11:54.320
you don't think so. I think you got to start fresh. No, fuck that noise. Like he's not going

11:54.320 --> 12:01.680
to chase you off because he advanced and you reposted. Yeah. It may be actually less awkward

12:01.680 --> 12:06.720
for him if you just act like nothing ever happened or more awkward, but regardless, but fuck that guy.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.040
It's like getting fired from a job, but then asked to still complete your work.

12:12.320 --> 12:17.440
He's the one who set this off. He set it off is what I'm saying. So you shouldn't be the one who's

12:17.440 --> 12:22.880
like, Oh, I better hide. That's a good question. He should be asking us how to hot out after out.

12:22.880 --> 12:30.400
Hey, I don't goofed so hard with my best friend. I goof guys. I wish I'd asked you before I asked

12:30.400 --> 12:36.080
this girl out. Ask us before you do anything. Oh, that's it. Then don't. So after you reject them,

12:36.080 --> 12:41.040
just look at them and say, you're free to go. Now I've booked you an exciting travel package

12:41.840 --> 12:48.080
in the Alps. Fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of my life. Denny Griffin. Yeah, I got you.

12:48.080 --> 12:54.400
Um, I, uh, I was drunk last night, uh, and I ended up asking for Yahoo questions on Twitter,

12:54.400 --> 12:59.120
like eight times. Yeah, you did. I kept forgetting that I had done it. You're like,

12:59.120 --> 13:04.160
my heart's totally eclipsing. Yeah. Give me some Yahoo's. So thank you. Everybody who,

13:04.160 --> 13:09.680
cause people responded each and every time. Okay. Uh, this one was sent in by Louie dog.

13:09.680 --> 13:18.320
Uh, it's by Yahoo answers, user hams hams asks what's a gnarly catchphrase to say after I score

13:18.320 --> 13:26.880
a touchdown, something, something like protect this house or all day, every day.

13:31.920 --> 13:37.200
Oh my God. There's let me, let me, let me set the bar. K C A M responded.

13:37.200 --> 13:43.840
Fuck you bitches. Fuck you bitches. That's good. That's good. Maximus prime says, I like to call

13:43.840 --> 13:52.320
that an old fashioned ass whooping. That's a little wordy. Yeah. I like to touchdown six points.

13:52.320 --> 13:57.840
I like to call that an old fashioned ass whooping. Nobody. Yeah. It's gotta be simple. It's gotta be

13:57.840 --> 14:02.560
something you can just project. You can just shoot out like buckshot from your mouth. When you get

14:02.560 --> 14:09.920
that, that sweet, good six point run and you pick six and a football match. Didn't crack my pants

14:09.920 --> 14:17.440
this time. Too long. You got to shoot, explode. It's just got to explode. Like scored them.

14:19.680 --> 14:27.760
How about that? Eat my farts. See that's good. If like, um, you've just been sacked in the,

14:27.760 --> 14:32.640
in the red zone. You just got that pick six and you get sacked in the red zone, but you scored them

14:33.120 --> 14:36.720
and you can say, eat my farts. And like, there's a bunch of dudes on top of you. Like the ball

14:36.720 --> 14:42.880
across the plane of score. I got the ball past the plane of score. Eat these farts. That's good.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.840
I'm the Superman of points.

14:45.840 --> 14:53.360
That'll be pretty good. Um, how about big game? Big game? Yeah. Because like, you're letting

14:53.360 --> 15:00.720
everybody know that this is like a big deal for you. Well, you should just shout momentous. Best

15:00.720 --> 15:08.880
day ever. Um, did you guys see that? There are one of any number of Harry Potter spells that you

15:08.880 --> 15:16.080
could check. That would be perfect. Flipendo. Levitarla. No, that's a Spanish word for live.

15:16.080 --> 15:24.880
Expelliarmus. Um, yeah. Summon your expecto, expecto patronum. Yeah. Cause your dad,

15:24.880 --> 15:30.160
cause you want your dad to be able to see it. I wish my dad was here. That's a good one.

15:30.160 --> 15:36.400
I wish my dad was alive. I wish my dad was alive. I wish my dad was alive. I wish my dad was alive.

15:36.400 --> 15:44.800
That's a good one. I wish my dad was alive. Dad, check this. Pick six. Ghost dad beat my moves.

15:46.080 --> 15:55.920
Cosby. Cosby is so great. Just yell Cosby. See how Cosby I was on that move. And then do the

15:55.920 --> 16:04.880
Cosby dance from the Cosby show. I stiff armed him and it was straight cause. Yeah. No joke,

16:04.880 --> 16:11.920
full cause. Cosby swag over here. Maybe you should use your moment of glory to make a statement

16:11.920 --> 16:17.040
that's, that's really important. That's impactful. Okay. Maybe you shout like, like as soon as you

16:17.040 --> 16:22.080
touch down, you're like free Tibet or maybe like, or maybe like bring back Dunkaroos.

16:22.080 --> 16:26.960
Like something like that. Those two things are, are roughly equal on the important spectrum.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.680
In the spectrum of time I spent thinking about them, they're pretty close to equal.

16:31.680 --> 16:36.480
Mm-hmm. I used to, I used to do all my philosophical discussions and ponderings

16:36.480 --> 16:41.440
about the state of Tibet while eating Dunkaroos. And I find that without them,

16:42.640 --> 16:46.560
it's hard to do the first thing too. Exactly. That's exactly my point. Is there a,

16:46.560 --> 16:51.280
is there a, can we boil this down and set of words? Is there a thing you can do with your body?

16:52.720 --> 16:53.360
Wiener out.

16:55.040 --> 16:59.600
See, but you're covered in so much gear and it's hard to get to the, it's, you have like a cup.

16:59.600 --> 17:07.200
Maybe there's pantomime wiener out. Oh, yeah. I don't know. And then kind of a back and forth

17:07.200 --> 17:12.480
swing, which you guys can't see me because I'm of course speaking into a microphone,

17:12.480 --> 17:20.400
but I totally just did. I've known you for 23 years. I know when you're pretending to pantomime

17:20.400 --> 17:26.080
a dick swing. Maybe pantomime is something from another sport. Like you score a touchdown,

17:26.080 --> 17:32.480
then pantomime shooting a free throw. Wouldn't that be, because people won't know what you're doing.

17:32.480 --> 17:37.520
What if you're like Michael Jordan and you're proficient at every sport and also my best friend

17:37.520 --> 17:41.280
and then every sport you do, you do something fucking awesome. And then you do a thing from

17:41.280 --> 17:47.680
the other sport. Or like one step further and like pantomime reading a book, pantomime pouring some

17:47.680 --> 17:54.160
tea. Yeah, right. Exactly. Kiss one of them on the mouth. What if you sat on the ground and

17:54.160 --> 18:01.840
scooted your butt across the grass like a dog? Hey, get off of there. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Make

18:01.840 --> 18:07.280
the ref come over and swat you on the nose. When you score a touchdown, just kind of meander around

18:07.280 --> 18:13.680
and look real confused. Did I do it? What was that? What if while you play football, you just

18:13.680 --> 18:24.240
constantly yell what you're doing? I'm running. Pass. Catch. Sack. Avoid. Juke. Juke. Steroids.

18:24.960 --> 18:32.880
Fake punt. Oh shit. Dog fights. So Justin, I want you to know I've never fully appreciated

18:32.880 --> 18:38.640
your job as the question reader. But like the feeling of when it's time to move on to a new

18:38.640 --> 18:44.000
question is something like I think it's a science. I think it's an art that I don't have yet. But I

18:44.000 --> 18:49.200
feel like that time is now. Yeah, the touchdown question ended like four minutes ago. I know.

18:50.160 --> 18:55.120
Do aliens exist? My boyfriend is terrified and thinks that he's been abducted before.

18:55.120 --> 19:00.400
He watches UFO videos a lot and has shown me some. And sometimes they look very real. It's

19:00.400 --> 19:05.200
not that I'm not open to the possibility. I'm just worried that he thinks and worries too much about

19:05.200 --> 19:12.480
it. Are they real? What should I do? And that comes from Steph from Gmail. You know what looks real?

19:12.480 --> 19:21.360
Independence Day. Yeah, those looked real. Are they real? Absolutely. In this in this crazy,

19:21.360 --> 19:28.800
like huge universe. Yeah. I think the chances that we are like the only planet with habitation,

19:28.800 --> 19:33.360
I mean, it's it might be true, but I think that that is a little ridiculous to assume.

19:33.360 --> 19:38.560
But I also think it's ridiculous to assume that if there are other creatures on other planets,

19:38.560 --> 19:42.560
they totes want to come down and take us like. No, they want to they'd want to hang out.

19:43.120 --> 19:49.600
Yeah. Well, that's a pretty cool species. But it's like me thinking that because there's people

19:49.600 --> 19:54.320
in other countries, they want to come kidnap me like just because other people exist in the

19:54.320 --> 19:59.760
world in the galaxy doesn't mean they want to come get you. That's a good question.

19:59.760 --> 20:05.120
They just want to come down and hang. Yeah. Yeah. And if they were going to abduct someone,

20:05.120 --> 20:10.320
why wouldn't they take like George Clooney or the president? I don't know what. Explain to me your

20:10.320 --> 20:15.520
thought. Like, why? Why would they take those people? Well, because they are important. That's

20:15.520 --> 20:20.400
fine. But as we've established, these aliens just want to bro down. Right. They just want to hang.

20:20.400 --> 20:25.600
They just want to hang with some cool bros and like watch watch a movie or something. So they

20:25.600 --> 20:30.480
just came down to like check out the chicken wing situation and they came down and they abducted the

20:30.480 --> 20:40.000
president. They would be fucked. The whole planet would be on lockdown. Like a full blown ID4 panic

20:40.000 --> 20:44.800
and nobody they don't want that to happen. So the stakes are too high in that situation. So instead,

20:45.520 --> 20:52.400
they want to take like Jimmy from Sheboygan and just like chill fucking want to take a game

20:52.400 --> 21:00.800
bro out. Yeah. Crack up. Crack a heinie. By which I mean a Heineken and not his not his but

21:00.800 --> 21:06.560
although they may do that, too, because they're aliens, those fucking nasty aliens. Gross. Up

21:06.560 --> 21:12.480
until that moment, aliens were starting to sound pretty cool. Yeah. Always that always that loophole

21:13.200 --> 21:20.240
by which I mean your butt. It's not they're not doing it to they don't know what they're doing.

21:20.240 --> 21:26.240
That's how they talk in their in their language. They talk telepathically and.

21:26.240 --> 21:32.720
But a path of rec rec. Yeah. Rectal level. Rectal path. Rectal allowably.

21:32.720 --> 21:40.160
Megalovale. Suppositorily. I think Stephanie should tell your boyfriend. I think of worrying about

21:40.160 --> 21:46.160
aliens is sort of like Todd Snyder, a singer songwriter. Todd Snyder says about a gay marriage.

21:46.160 --> 21:51.440
What do you say? That's that's something that worries people that ain't got shit all else to

21:51.440 --> 21:55.760
be worried about. And I think that your boyfriend needs to get worried about some real things.

21:55.760 --> 22:01.280
He's worried about you. If you're happy, your happiness, financial stability. That's a real

22:01.280 --> 22:08.080
thing. Global warming. Libya. What's going on over there? I don't know. Superflu. Superflu.

22:08.800 --> 22:13.760
Yeah. The oncoming pandemic. There's all kinds of shit. What do you mean oncoming? You sound like

22:13.760 --> 22:19.920
like you sound like. Well, I'm patient zero, so I like a bunch of rocks in a bucket right now.

22:19.920 --> 22:25.040
You've got it already. You're hurting my feelings. No, I'm saying it's a good sound.

22:25.040 --> 22:29.600
It's OK. Oh, you like it. Yeah. But you do sound like a bunch of rocks just

22:29.600 --> 22:32.240
shuffling around in a bucket. Sure. I get it. Yeah. Yeah.

22:33.600 --> 22:38.320
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo for us that you might be able to toss our way? Yeah,

22:38.320 --> 22:46.080
I I have like sixty six and I'll do one of them. OK, thank you. This one was sent in by Rob Starabin.

22:46.640 --> 22:52.880
Thanks. It's by Yahoo Answers user Mr. Chocolate, but asks.

22:54.400 --> 23:00.400
I am looking to start my own porn website. I'm serious. Only answer if you have suggestions.

23:00.400 --> 23:07.120
But we are like we're made of suggestions and names for content. I want to start a website

23:07.120 --> 23:12.320
because porn is a billion dollar industry. I feel as though this could be one of the easiest things

23:12.320 --> 23:17.360
to do. I visit these sites. Doesn't seem to be much to do. Any suggestions on how to get the site

23:17.360 --> 23:22.320
up and running. I can take care of the other details. See, it does. It seems easy, but there's

23:22.320 --> 23:29.200
a lot of administrative decisions that you have to make when setting up this this sort of website.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.560
And setting up this this sort of like you. You need a business plan is what I'm saying.

23:35.360 --> 23:41.280
So wait, I'm confused here as to what exactly he's like, how to put something on the Internet.

23:43.040 --> 23:48.560
I mean, that that seems he doesn't seem to mention any specifics like. Yeah, I dig this guy because

23:48.560 --> 23:54.240
he's saying I have lots of videos of women having sex. Well, I just don't. It's women. Do we know

23:54.240 --> 24:00.800
it's not like alpacas? Do I have something? Alpaca porn is a billion dollar industry. Can you

24:00.800 --> 24:06.400
explain to me what is it just alpacas fucking? Well, there's some romance there, too. I mean,

24:06.400 --> 24:10.880
it's not just fucking. Oh, it's all about the story. Yeah. Are you saying the plot? Yeah.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.960
You know, like there's not about that. Like an alpaca delivery man rolls up and he's like,

24:14.960 --> 24:19.680
hey, I brought these alpacas you were looking for. And she's like, but I've already got six alpacas.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.880
But then they find that they have a lot in common. And then the alpacas fuck.

24:22.880 --> 24:29.520
Okay. Oh, cool. I've heard. It's not that I've ever seen that or anything.

24:30.560 --> 24:35.920
No, no, no. This I mean, this guy asked for suggestions. Alpacas fucking romantically.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.520
Romantically fucking. Yeah. I mean, it's it's sensual. It's not like there's no like

24:40.080 --> 24:43.360
there's no like anger in it or anything. I mean, it's just very sweet. And then they

24:43.360 --> 24:47.120
kind of you would be you would probably think there was anger because alpacas make

24:47.760 --> 24:52.720
weird noises when they're not fucking. I can only imagine like mid coitus, like the kind of grunts

24:52.720 --> 24:57.520
that those things can produce. It's the worst. It sounds like that. Like it sounds like Justin

24:57.520 --> 25:04.160
right now. Yeah. And I said my voice sounds like bourbon soaked alpacas that have been hit by a car

25:04.160 --> 25:08.160
and then fucking while fucking. And then they fucked afterwards because they were so happy

25:08.160 --> 25:14.240
to be alive. We make it. Let's suck the marrow out of this, Deborah.

25:14.240 --> 25:21.200
All right. Carpe my alpaca tape.

25:22.640 --> 25:29.600
I've got a notepad and a pin out. I'm writing number one. Alpaca fucking. Mm hmm. This spitball.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.840
What about alpaca farming? I hear that's a billion dollar a year industry too.

25:33.840 --> 25:37.520
That's as long as we're at it. You can get what about full house slash Vic?

25:37.520 --> 25:46.960
Oh, my God. That always goes down right. Can you? I almost hesitate to ask.

25:46.960 --> 25:53.040
Don't Google it. I don't think you want me to do this. This is I've been working on this one.

25:53.040 --> 25:57.920
This is my magnum opus, you guys. It's a Danny Joey romance.

25:59.920 --> 26:05.840
This one I call it a novella. It's pretty long. It's called Late Night, San Francisco,

26:05.840 --> 26:12.160
Danny Joey Mida. So we're workshopping the title.

26:12.160 --> 26:16.640
Workshopping the title, but check it totally out. Going to give you some rad boners.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.600
And it's got maybe a little bit of nostalgia, too.

26:19.600 --> 26:25.120
It's got MMM. It's got MFM. MFM. And it's got MMF.

26:25.120 --> 26:32.480
It's got Comet. Comet's in the mix. Yeah, but I made him an alpaca, so.

26:32.480 --> 26:37.200
They make Kimmy Gibbler watch. I made Comet an alpaca,

26:37.200 --> 26:40.080
and I made Kimmy Gibbler watch. So it's it's a pretty messed up story.

26:41.040 --> 26:45.520
But you're really going to like the plot twists. Don't forget to comment if you dig it.

26:46.640 --> 26:50.320
What about fucking ghosts? Has anybody done that yet?

26:51.040 --> 26:53.520
About fucking ghosts, because that opens up a lot of doors.

26:53.520 --> 27:02.320
Because it could be it could either be a really high fi, like Ghostbusters II production,

27:02.320 --> 27:09.120
where you can fuck any woman in history. In history, if you've got the SFX right,

27:09.120 --> 27:13.760
if you get what works on that, if you get the like the Peter Jackson industrial light and

27:13.760 --> 27:19.280
magic and sound on that, that could be a high quality, very erotic porno.

27:19.280 --> 27:25.440
Or you can lo-fi it and just have you fucking the air.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.240
And you're like, pretend that you're fucking a ghost.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.240
You don't have to have a second party there.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
Hey, it's me, Madam Curie.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.760
Let's do it on top of this stack of Nobel prizes that I won.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.680
You and me, buddy. It's a working radio activity,

27:41.680 --> 27:45.680
and I'm going to do some work on radio act-dickety.

27:45.680 --> 27:54.080
Well, on that note, ghosts, full house, alpaca,

27:54.080 --> 27:57.120
one of those three is sure to be taking right to money.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.080
Or all three. What about all three together?

28:00.080 --> 28:04.400
Yeah. Hey, Danny, yes, Joey, I'm enjoying having sex with you,

28:04.400 --> 28:07.760
but what's with this ghostly alpaca?

28:07.760 --> 28:11.840
This spectral tiny llama, what's his deal?

28:11.840 --> 28:18.320
If you could just shore him and make me a coat from his ghost fur,

28:18.320 --> 28:20.800
I bet we could fetch a high price.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.200
Oh, you're always thinking about money while we're trying to make love.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.480
What do you think about the name-

28:24.480 --> 28:25.600
Classic jelly.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.640
Specter Smut. What do you think about that?

28:28.640 --> 28:29.200
I like it.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.480
Just for a site name.

28:30.480 --> 28:34.080
I like it. You'd have to buy it from that 70s funk band,

28:34.080 --> 28:36.160
but I think other than that, it'd be okay.

28:36.160 --> 28:45.600
How do you feel about the name Full House Fuller Buttholes?

28:45.600 --> 28:46.480
I like it a lot.

28:48.640 --> 28:49.920
So I think it's time-

28:49.920 --> 28:51.200
How do you feel about the name-

28:51.200 --> 28:51.760
Oh, God.

28:52.320 --> 28:58.400
You can call me Alpaca Pornography, but you put the emphasis on the Al.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.800
I think you can get that URL for sure.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.480
Yeah. We can GoDaddy it. No, we can't.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.800
Yeah. How did that guy fuck up that bad?

29:07.680 --> 29:08.960
Hey dog, you did a really bad job.

29:08.960 --> 29:12.240
Hey dog, you owned the internet basically.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.880
Like anytime anyone's like, I need a website.

29:14.880 --> 29:18.240
There's like one dude in the game, or maybe there are more dudes,

29:18.240 --> 29:22.160
but in their minds, it's like, oh, this one dude's got this whole game on lockdown.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.360
And the only thing you have to do to keep the internet on lockdown

29:25.360 --> 29:27.120
was not shoot an elephant.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.720
The only thing you had to do was not shoot an elephant.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.600
You could even shoot an elephant as long as you don't video it

29:33.600 --> 29:35.040
and put it on YouTube.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.360
You silly bitch, you had the internet.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.880
Do that in your secret time.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.080
Don't tell people about it.

29:41.120 --> 29:44.480
I like to shoot things I shouldn't do, but I don't go around squawking.

29:44.480 --> 29:49.040
Yeah. I'm sure Facebook like organizes his own like bum fight rings.

29:49.600 --> 29:49.920
Yeah.

29:49.920 --> 29:54.400
But God damn, he's got the common sense not to put it on the YouTube.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.360
Don't shoot elephants, everybody.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.280
What happened? Do people like elephants?

29:59.280 --> 30:02.160
Yeah, dude. Like everybody likes elephants, I think.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.920
Everybody loves elephants and Raymond.

30:09.120 --> 30:13.840
Hey, Griffin, I, I, uh, if you want to see elephants,

30:13.840 --> 30:15.280
you got to take a journey.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.080
Oh man.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.120
This is a trip.

30:17.120 --> 30:17.760
All right.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.440
I can already tell this is not your best,

30:19.440 --> 30:22.080
but, uh, I'm not in the mood to see elephants.

30:22.080 --> 30:36.960
So I'd rather take a trip to the money zone.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.160
What do you want from me?

30:42.160 --> 30:43.440
Like what you expecting?

30:43.440 --> 30:46.320
I just want a touch of class.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.600
You thought I'd do it again?

30:47.600 --> 30:49.760
There was something more insightful.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.160
Guys, this is a special money zone trip.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.520
Oh, good.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.960
It's our first personal message.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.560
It's from, um, it's from listener Tony Zito.

30:59.520 --> 31:05.440
Uh, and Tony Zito, uh, wants to thank his lovely friend whose name is Grace

31:05.440 --> 31:08.320
because Grace is looking after his cat for six weeks.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.560
While Tony Zito is in Tibet.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.560
I don't know what he's doing.

31:12.560 --> 31:16.080
I'm assuming he's in Tibet, just partying or freedom,

31:16.080 --> 31:20.080
freedom and bringing Dunkaroos back in the style.

31:20.080 --> 31:24.160
Um, and Grace is doing this shit for free.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.320
Have you guys ever taken care of a cat before?

31:26.320 --> 31:28.080
No, it's hard, hard work.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.720
It's like the hardest work.

31:30.720 --> 31:36.640
Um, so he provided us with funds and we are shouting her out.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.520
Um, Travis, why don't you say something nice about Grace?

31:39.520 --> 31:42.560
Um, well, she sounds really great.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.600
Um, oh God.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.880
Um, and I trust her not to kill that cat.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.280
You fucking dumb shit.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.000
It's right there on the sheet though.

31:52.000 --> 31:52.240
Okay.

31:52.240 --> 31:52.720
Here.

31:52.720 --> 31:55.680
She is obviously the sweetest and a great friend.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.040
Well, if you're going to be shitty about it, God damn it.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.520
I think we need to hire her to watch you for a week.

32:03.280 --> 32:08.240
Well, I'm sure that Tony's cat, Prebella, um, is, is super grateful.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.080
Yeah.

32:10.080 --> 32:14.400
Griffin's a lot like grace cause he's going to have to clean up your shit for a month.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.240
Hey, do you, do you guys know, um, where these crazy kids met?

32:18.960 --> 32:19.280
No.

32:19.280 --> 32:26.160
Tell me the maximum funtastic convention, which is shortened to max fun con.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.000
I did not know that.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.120
That's not true, but they met there.

32:31.120 --> 32:34.640
If you guys want to meet some friends, you're going to have to wait till next year.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.720
Cause I'm pretty sure it's all sold out.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.360
Um, but man, that joint is going to be a party.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.040
I bet it's going to be blown up.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.200
Uh, she has a little bit of a TV addiction from what I hear.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.960
What do you think she's into right now?

32:46.960 --> 32:47.440
I don't know.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.560
He's got that sweet cable.

32:48.560 --> 32:53.360
She's probably, she's probably really into a show about cake.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.880
She used to be a lot of that these days.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.520
Cake wives, cake wives.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.600
That's the wives of men who make cakes.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.720
Sister cake about cakes that are sisters.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.080
I love this cake.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.760
If you love this cake so much, why don't you marry it?

33:05.760 --> 33:07.200
I already did sister cakes.

33:07.200 --> 33:12.640
I like cake hunters international because they go all over the country and look for the greatest cake.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.640
Have you guys ever watched river cake monsters?

33:17.040 --> 33:17.680
Hey, you know what?

33:17.680 --> 33:19.360
I like dirty cakes with micro.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.360
Yeah, get this.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.880
This cake has a tire on it.

33:25.200 --> 33:28.400
Why did you, why did you leave my cake in a sewage treatment plant?

33:28.400 --> 33:29.760
This cake is ruined.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.880
So, um, she has her own business cleaning houses and taking care of babies.

33:36.880 --> 33:37.600
What's it called?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.520
Give me a name or give her a name.

33:39.520 --> 33:39.920
What?

33:39.920 --> 33:40.960
For a business.

33:40.960 --> 33:41.920
Babes and suds.

33:41.920 --> 33:42.720
Babes and suds.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.640
Baby with the bathwater.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.800
Baby and bathwater.

33:46.800 --> 33:47.520
Bathwater.

33:47.520 --> 33:47.840
Yes.

33:48.640 --> 33:49.680
You nailed it.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.040
So thank you to Grace.

33:51.040 --> 33:51.680
Thank you, Grace.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.480
Thank you, Tony.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.000
You guys are going to be best friends forever.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.360
For life.

33:55.360 --> 33:55.760
For life.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.080
If you ever split up, don't tell us about it.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.840
Well, like break up, like friend break up.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.080
Yeah.

34:00.080 --> 34:00.720
Friend break up.

34:01.280 --> 34:01.600
Okay.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.040
Maybe that'll happen.

34:03.040 --> 34:08.720
If Purbella, say, um, goes on a trip to heaven.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.000
To a farm with a lot of other kiddies.

34:13.200 --> 34:13.840
That's not funny.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.440
Don't joke about a man's cat eye.

34:15.440 --> 34:16.480
Okay, I won't.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.760
Purbella's fucking dead.

34:17.760 --> 34:18.240
What's up?

34:20.800 --> 34:23.600
But listen, we don't just do personal messages on the show.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.440
We like, we like businesses too.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.280
I prefer business actually.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.400
I actually prefer, Grace, you're great, but you're not a business.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.560
I have a heart for industry.

34:32.560 --> 34:33.440
My mom always said.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.360
We're tycoons of business.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.240
Robber barons.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.840
We're carpetbaggers of the business industry.

34:41.440 --> 34:41.920
Cool.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.360
So is there a business?

34:45.040 --> 34:46.400
I just want to keep going.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.720
You think there's, is there any certain business or just like,

34:48.720 --> 34:50.720
we celebrate the idea of corporate.

34:50.720 --> 34:51.920
Well, let me, let me pitch.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.120
Let me pitch to you this.

34:53.680 --> 34:54.080
Okay.

34:54.080 --> 34:54.560
Hit me.

34:54.560 --> 35:00.000
Have you ever wished that you lived, we'll say a decade in the future.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.080
10 whole years in the future.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.920
Where business is no more.

35:03.920 --> 35:07.040
It's a dystopian, dystopian, wasteland, business free.

35:07.920 --> 35:08.640
Okay.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.240
You know, I'd never wish that.

35:10.240 --> 35:15.120
Can it be like a, um, one of those futures where like businesses run the whole show?

35:15.120 --> 35:15.520
Okay.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.480
So not dystopian.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.920
It's fully topian.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.160
I'm the last free man though.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.240
Like I'm the last like non-corporate man.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.560
When everyone else is branded with the sigils of industry.

35:27.120 --> 35:27.520
Yeah.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.640
Justin is free.

35:28.640 --> 35:29.440
I'm on the run.

35:29.440 --> 35:30.320
Justin's on the run.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.240
And I need flexibility.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.840
I need something flattering.

35:33.840 --> 35:34.080
Yes.

35:34.080 --> 35:34.880
Where?

35:34.880 --> 35:35.280
Yeah.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.520
You need, obviously this is a ballsy move.

35:37.520 --> 35:42.800
So you need something that is really going to showcase your whole dick to the people,

35:42.800 --> 35:44.160
to the business tycoons.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.880
It's going to make your dick so aerodynamic.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.040
It's not even funny.

35:49.040 --> 35:54.960
Your dick will seem like it's been fletched by an aeromaker for maximum.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.400
The finest aeromaker.

35:56.400 --> 36:03.440
My dick has been fletched by the finest aeromaker and now it sails through the wind.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.240
Thank you, Rootsuit.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.960
This, this, this innovation is called a Rootsuit.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.960
Um, and, uh, I don't think we can describe it with our voices.

36:14.960 --> 36:19.040
You, this is a Rootsuit is really something you need to Google and you will Google it.

36:19.040 --> 36:24.880
And you'll, you will say it does look like his dick's been fletched, um, or vagina.

36:24.880 --> 36:25.380
Uh huh.

36:26.240 --> 36:30.640
Since these are, these are, um, these are high quality suits for ladies and men.

36:31.600 --> 36:32.480
What are they, Griffin?

36:32.480 --> 36:33.200
What are they?

36:33.200 --> 36:33.840
All right.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.440
They're, they're very futuristic.

36:35.440 --> 36:36.880
First off, just off the bat.

36:37.440 --> 36:44.880
Um, they are flatteringly, they fit flatteringly on your frame.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.360
Um, they hug.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.800
It's like wearing a suit that's hugging you the entire time.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.240
What is the purpose of this?

36:52.240 --> 36:53.680
Why would I wear this suit?

36:53.680 --> 36:56.000
Um, to look futuristic.

36:56.720 --> 36:57.520
Okay.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.680
And the details that were provided, it says it's great for Harry Potter fans.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.160
Oh yeah.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.280
I don't understand that.

37:03.280 --> 37:03.760
Don't recall.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.280
Is it maybe for like sporting events?

37:05.280 --> 37:10.480
Like I'd wear a multicolored Rootsuit and, uh, and then I root for the home team.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.320
It could be that.

37:12.320 --> 37:16.480
I think you're making a statement, you know, with a Rootsuit.

37:16.480 --> 37:23.200
In this economy, I think that the greatest thing about it, it is 100% American.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.840
Not one of those foreign Rootsuits you hear about.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.680
They are based in New Orleans.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.800
100% American made.

37:32.000 --> 37:32.800
Do you know what it is?

37:33.920 --> 37:39.520

37:39.520 --> 37:40.800
look like Pepsi man.

37:40.800 --> 37:41.760

Scare.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.720
These things are kind of fucking scary.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.280
But just because you can't see their face.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.400
If you, if you're superheroing, obviously.

39:07.200 --> 39:07.700
Yellow.

Yellow.

39:08.800 --> 39:09.680
Bright yellow.

39:09.680 --> 39:09.920
Yeah.

And then write mustard across your chest.

39:35.760 --> 39:37.600
But people are going to know that that's my bim-bam.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.760
Like we're not, we're not here.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.200
We're just really into toppings.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.760
Yeah. Hi, we're the Condiment Brothers.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.480
But we'll know.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.040
You know us.

39:45.040 --> 39:45.600
We'll know.

39:46.640 --> 39:47.120
Griffin.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.840
Oh my God, I have to do a jingle.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.800
Yeah, and I need you to do a jingle about Tony Zito's friend, Grace.

39:54.800 --> 39:55.760
Okay.

39:55.760 --> 39:56.960
And Rootsuits.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.040
Oh, well that should be easy to portmanteau.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.560
Let me just portmanteau that together.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.200
Thank you.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.080
Oh my God.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.040
I really forgot.

40:05.680 --> 40:06.560
No pre-pro?

40:06.560 --> 40:12.160
No pre-pro on this one.

40:12.160 --> 40:12.480
All right.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.560
That's my chord progression.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.080
All the best songs start out with the singer saying,

40:20.080 --> 40:21.280
that's my chord progression.

40:27.360 --> 40:30.160
Who's that whispering in the trees?

40:30.160 --> 40:32.880
It's two sailors and they're on leave.

40:32.880 --> 40:35.520
Pipes and chains and swinging hands.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.800
Who's your daddy?

40:36.800 --> 40:38.240
Yes, I am.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.320
Fat cat came to play.

40:40.880 --> 40:43.440
Now he can't run fast enough.

40:43.440 --> 40:47.600
You had best stay away when the pushers come to shove.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.640
Rootsuit riot.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.920
Rootsuit riot.

40:59.200 --> 40:59.700
Grace.

40:59.700 --> 41:02.740
Grace, it's time to feed the cat.

41:02.740 --> 41:04.340
Throw back a bottle of beer.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.940
Pull a comb through that cat's black hair.

41:07.940 --> 41:09.460
Rootsuit riot, yeah.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.260
Rootsuit riot.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.300
Rootsuit riot.

41:20.900 --> 41:21.400
Nope.

41:22.740 --> 41:23.460
I loved it.

41:23.460 --> 41:25.220
That's Rootsuit.com.

41:25.220 --> 41:30.260
Travis hit me with a new question.

41:30.260 --> 41:31.780
Rootsuit riot.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.060
I think if I took it to the minor.

41:33.060 --> 41:33.620
You're done.

41:33.620 --> 41:34.500
You're out.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.780
Travis, next.

41:35.780 --> 41:40.420
I'm a young college student and I'm having some issues with my wardrobe.

41:40.420 --> 41:45.060
You see, I really like dress shirts because I feel like they make me look classier,

41:45.060 --> 41:46.180
even on a bad day.

41:46.180 --> 41:47.620
So I tend to wear them a lot.

41:47.620 --> 41:51.460
I just have a nice shiny silver watch that I wear to try to classify.

41:51.460 --> 41:56.660
I just have a nice shiny silver watch that I wear to try to class myself up as well.

41:56.660 --> 41:58.820
The issue is that because we are in college,

41:58.820 --> 42:03.060
a lot of my friends don't feel like putting in the effort to avoid looking sloppy unless

42:03.060 --> 42:04.180
they're going out.

42:04.180 --> 42:07.620
And when I'm hanging out with them, I feel awkward and overdressed.

42:07.620 --> 42:11.620
Is there a way to beat this feeling without having to hang up the dress shirts for good?

42:11.620 --> 42:15.780
Or do I just have to surrender to the slob and stop giving a shit?

42:15.780 --> 42:17.380
Hopefully handsome Hawkeye.

42:17.380 --> 42:22.820
Oh, I don't think I think you should always look as classy as you possibly can.

42:23.620 --> 42:24.580
I completely agree.

42:24.580 --> 42:25.300
No one.

42:25.300 --> 42:29.300
Do you guys know that every time we record the show, I'm wearing sleep pants and wearing

42:29.300 --> 42:31.860
a T-shirt, but I'm also wearing a boutonniere.

42:32.660 --> 42:33.380
That's fancy.

42:33.380 --> 42:34.020
I like that.

42:34.020 --> 42:35.140
That's a classy touch.

42:35.140 --> 42:37.620
I'm wearing a cummerbund and nothing else.

42:38.580 --> 42:40.500
I should have been.

42:40.500 --> 42:44.100
I am also wearing a cummerbund and that's why I keep the boutonniere pin.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.780
I think that, you know,

42:45.780 --> 42:48.100
I think that, you know, like I've never.

42:49.460 --> 42:53.540
I think if you got to be one of them, you've got to be overdressed or underdressed.

42:53.540 --> 42:54.820
You always want to be overdressed.

42:54.820 --> 42:55.460
Yeah, sure.

42:55.460 --> 42:57.140
You always want to be the classiest guy in the place.

42:57.140 --> 42:57.940
Because you can flip that around.

42:57.940 --> 42:59.540
It's like, hey, what's up?

42:59.540 --> 43:00.580
Fancy pants for a game.

43:00.580 --> 43:01.940
You'd be like, yeah, I look nice.

43:01.940 --> 43:02.740
Like, look, you're nice.

43:02.740 --> 43:04.580
And I feel nice about the way I look.

43:04.580 --> 43:06.740
Yeah, I look like, you know, I don't.

43:06.740 --> 43:10.900
I don't think I've ever felt too under too overdressed to go somewhere.

43:10.900 --> 43:13.220
But I've definitely felt too underdressed.

43:13.220 --> 43:17.220
Like when I've just finished like building a set and I'm covered in paint and dirt and everything.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.380
I'm not going out somewhere classy like that.

43:19.380 --> 43:22.580
But man, it always feels nice to get dressed up.

43:22.580 --> 43:23.860
Like I did.

43:23.860 --> 43:28.660
I did one time wear khakis to a comic book convention to Mid-Ohio Con.

43:28.660 --> 43:32.420
And I got I actually got some shit from people there because I did you.

43:32.420 --> 43:32.820
Yeah.

43:32.820 --> 43:35.940
Well, that's because khakis are like the worst clothing ever.

43:36.820 --> 43:38.100
Yeah, I was young.

43:38.100 --> 43:38.660
I didn't know.

43:38.660 --> 43:39.540
Yeah, I know.

43:39.540 --> 43:42.580
I have I have a certain amount of vehemence towards khakis.

43:42.580 --> 43:43.140
I hate them.

43:44.260 --> 43:45.460
Because you got to wear them for work.

43:45.460 --> 43:49.540
Well, that and like khakis say, hey, I want to get dressed up.

43:49.540 --> 43:51.700
But without all the hassle of getting dressed up.

43:52.340 --> 43:55.140
Like, it's just such a sloppy commitment to getting dressed up.

43:55.140 --> 43:57.380
Just put on some dress pants and commit to it.

43:57.380 --> 44:00.340
So you're saying khakis are like fancy, ugly jeans, basically.

44:00.340 --> 44:00.580
Yes.

44:01.380 --> 44:02.980
Fancy, ugly sweatpants.

44:02.980 --> 44:04.020
Yes, that's exactly.

44:04.020 --> 44:07.940
Because they they're supposed to be fancy, but everybody knows they're actually totally cash.

44:07.940 --> 44:08.180
Yep.

44:09.700 --> 44:10.660
Fuck khakis.

44:10.660 --> 44:11.460
That's our new motto.

44:11.460 --> 44:11.940
Fuck khakis.

44:11.940 --> 44:12.900
Fuck khakis.

44:12.900 --> 44:18.900
You also get the benefit of you get the benefit with with addressing too classy.

44:18.900 --> 44:24.500
It's a lot easier to unclass an outfit, you know, untuck the shirt, undo a button.

44:24.500 --> 44:29.620
It's a lot easier to do that than it is to like tuck in your T-shirt and straighten your collar

44:30.900 --> 44:32.180
that you don't have.

44:32.180 --> 44:34.740
Yeah, I was going to say that's a fucked up T-shirt.

44:34.740 --> 44:37.060
Yeah, pretty gross T-shirt.

44:37.060 --> 44:38.020
Is that the new style?

44:38.820 --> 44:39.540
I guess.

44:39.540 --> 44:40.420
I can't keep up.

44:40.420 --> 44:43.620
I think that from what I remember of college, God knows.

44:44.740 --> 44:49.380
I never understood the idea of like rolling out of bed and rolling up to class in like

44:49.380 --> 44:53.220
pajama pants and your scuzzy T-shirt and shit.

44:53.220 --> 44:54.820
Like, I don't get it.

44:54.820 --> 44:58.820
It seems like you're putting so much effort into looking like you didn't put any effort

44:58.820 --> 44:59.780
into your outfit.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.820
Like, I just don't get it.

45:02.820 --> 45:06.100
Like, I don't get, hey, we're young, attractive people.

45:06.100 --> 45:08.100
So let's make ourselves look like shit.

45:08.100 --> 45:11.540
Like, just put in a little effort, clean yourselves up.

45:11.540 --> 45:13.460
Yeah, you're in your sexual prime.

45:13.460 --> 45:13.700
Yeah.

45:14.580 --> 45:16.900
Get some partners going.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.500
Don't waste it on that.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.020
Take those sweatpants off.

45:22.020 --> 45:26.020
Take off those fucking khakis and get yourself some partners.

45:26.020 --> 45:27.700
Get yourself some partners.

45:27.700 --> 45:29.300
You're in your sexual prime.

45:29.300 --> 45:30.820
Dress to impress.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.100
You're good to go.

45:32.100 --> 45:33.220
Dress to undress.

45:33.780 --> 45:35.460
Dress to undress, yes.

45:35.460 --> 45:37.300
Dress to undress.

45:37.300 --> 45:38.660
That's magical, Travis.

45:38.660 --> 45:40.420
You hit a, go get that on a T-shirt.

45:41.060 --> 45:41.860
Sorry to do that.

45:41.860 --> 45:42.580
Or a dress shirt.

45:42.580 --> 45:43.780
On a dress shirt.

45:43.780 --> 45:45.300
Get an Airbrush dress shirt.

45:46.500 --> 45:50.100
Do you guys, do you guys want a yahoo?

45:50.900 --> 45:51.460
Yes, please.

45:52.100 --> 45:53.380
Yeah, give me a yahoo.

45:55.220 --> 45:55.700
Too bad.

45:56.260 --> 45:56.980
You don't get one.

45:57.780 --> 45:58.180
What?

45:58.180 --> 46:01.540
Instead, guys, you know what we did?

46:01.540 --> 46:08.740
We tore another page off of our Gregorian,

46:08.740 --> 46:10.420
our Gregory Hines calendar.

46:10.420 --> 46:12.420
We tore it right off and we threw it away.

46:12.420 --> 46:13.860
And now it says I'm real.

46:15.060 --> 46:15.380
Shit.

46:15.380 --> 46:16.980
It's time for a new monthly observance.

46:17.780 --> 46:18.900
God damn it.

46:18.900 --> 46:22.820
I did not put in the pre-pro required to choose one.

46:22.820 --> 46:24.740
So we're going to have to do it like we did it last month.

46:25.540 --> 46:26.180
Oh, good.

46:26.180 --> 46:27.620
That was much better, I thought.

46:27.620 --> 46:28.900
I'm just going to name off some shit.

46:28.900 --> 46:30.420
And when you think we've struck gold,

46:30.420 --> 46:32.180
then we'll just dig right into that thing.

46:32.180 --> 46:32.580
Okay.

46:32.580 --> 46:35.700
It's like pre-pro during, it's like during pro.

46:35.700 --> 46:36.340
Cur pro.

46:37.140 --> 46:37.700
Cur pro.

46:40.180 --> 46:41.860
Atlanta food and wine month.

46:41.860 --> 46:42.660
No, I'm not.

46:42.660 --> 46:45.700
I don't know why Atlanta's getting its own shit.

46:45.700 --> 46:47.140
Brussels sprouts and cabbage month.

46:48.420 --> 46:50.100
Cranberries and gooseberries was.

46:50.100 --> 46:50.660
There it is.

46:50.660 --> 46:51.380
That's pretty funny.

46:51.380 --> 46:51.780
I didn't know.

46:51.780 --> 46:52.420
That's really good.

46:52.420 --> 46:55.300
I didn't know gooseberries was the, was an actual thing.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.300
Yeah, go figure.

46:57.300 --> 46:58.100
Go fig.

46:58.100 --> 47:00.500
Emotional overeating awareness month.

47:00.500 --> 47:02.420
It makes you really disgusted when people have read.

47:02.420 --> 47:03.380
Is that an emotion?

47:03.380 --> 47:04.020
Does that count?

47:04.740 --> 47:06.100
I'm repulsed by you, Becky.

47:06.900 --> 47:08.100
Grilled cheese month.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.180
What's her to say?

47:11.220 --> 47:11.780
Who does it?

47:11.780 --> 47:13.540
Who doesn't love grilled cheese yet?

47:13.540 --> 47:16.100
It is, it is Grange month.

47:16.100 --> 47:18.340
But I don't know if that means it's love Grange month.

47:18.340 --> 47:20.100
Cause I can fucking totally.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.300
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

47:23.300 --> 47:28.500
It's.

47:28.500 --> 47:29.220
Hey, that's good.

47:29.220 --> 47:29.380
Try.

47:29.380 --> 47:29.780
Thank you.

47:33.860 --> 47:35.300
It's like having the top right here.

47:35.860 --> 47:37.060
I wish I could stop you though.

47:37.060 --> 47:37.540
That's a different.

47:37.540 --> 47:38.660
No, just keep going.

47:38.660 --> 47:39.220
Keep going.

47:39.220 --> 47:41.780
We'll just, the rest of the podcast is going to be Travis singing Grange.

47:42.660 --> 47:43.700
And I'll do the guitar part.

47:46.420 --> 47:47.460
Holy humor month.

47:48.820 --> 47:49.540
What?

47:49.540 --> 47:51.540
I think holy humor month is our best one so far.

47:51.540 --> 48:00.340
There's also home improvement time, because it's not exclusively a month.

48:00.340 --> 48:03.460
It's just the time of home improvement.

48:03.460 --> 48:06.260
It's an entire month to appreciate the comedy of Tim Allen.

48:06.900 --> 48:09.380
Have you ever wondered what Jonathan Taylor Thomas is doing these days?

48:09.380 --> 48:10.420
It doesn't matter.

48:10.420 --> 48:12.340
All of her improvements on DVD.

48:12.340 --> 48:13.060
Just go get it.

48:14.580 --> 48:15.860
Month of the young child.

48:15.860 --> 48:17.540
National decorating month.

48:17.540 --> 48:18.500
It seems awfully.

48:19.140 --> 48:20.660
Can I say something about Tim Allen?

48:20.660 --> 48:24.500
I don't care for the man's comedy.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.220
Let's just hold on.

48:25.220 --> 48:25.780
Let's stop.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.100
Let's just do home improvement time.

48:28.100 --> 48:28.500
Okay.

48:28.500 --> 48:28.820
Okay.

48:28.820 --> 48:31.060
I want to say something about Tim Allen.

48:31.060 --> 48:34.580
This is a public service message from your friends and my brother, my brother, me.

48:34.580 --> 48:35.060
Okay.

48:36.100 --> 48:42.100
I don't enjoy the man's comedy myself, but do you realize what kind of a sailor you are?

48:42.100 --> 48:50.660
To walk into the studio exec's office and say, I'm going to make a show about a guy who hosts

48:50.660 --> 48:55.380
a home improvement show, and he has a fat bearded friend and a man that lives in a fence.

48:55.380 --> 48:58.580
Can I have a million dollars?

48:58.580 --> 49:00.660
Let's run this for 12 seasons.

49:00.660 --> 49:03.700
I want to run this for, it's going to run for 12 years.

49:03.700 --> 49:06.500
It's about a man and a fence and a dwarf.

49:06.500 --> 49:11.700
When you say man and a fence, he sounds like some sort of fable.

49:11.700 --> 49:13.220
Hi, my name is Wilson.

49:13.220 --> 49:14.180
I'm a fable.

49:14.740 --> 49:15.700
I'm your neighbor.

49:15.700 --> 49:16.500
Here's some wisdom.

49:16.500 --> 49:17.300
You did Grant Wishes.

49:18.500 --> 49:23.620
Everybody on that show, I think they all sort of simultaneously realized they weren't going

49:23.620 --> 49:27.460
to do any better work, and then just kind of fell off, right?

49:28.500 --> 49:30.740
Do you know how many executive producers that show has?

49:30.740 --> 49:33.220
I don't know how many executive producers that show has.

49:33.220 --> 49:36.740
Right? Do you know how many executive producers that show had?

49:37.700 --> 49:39.460
Um, I bet you're going to tell me.

49:40.100 --> 49:40.980
Nine.

49:40.980 --> 49:41.620
That just seems to me.

49:41.620 --> 49:43.300
So here's the public service message, okay?

49:43.300 --> 49:43.540
Okay.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.100
I feel like your life is directionless.

49:47.460 --> 49:49.940
They probably need someone to executive produce home improvement.

49:51.060 --> 49:52.500
Why not go over there and put in an app?

49:53.860 --> 49:54.900
My brother, my brother, right?

49:54.900 --> 49:58.100
That show's been off the air for like 13 whole years.

49:58.100 --> 49:58.900
But they're still making it.

49:58.900 --> 49:59.700
Well, what are these guys doing?

49:59.700 --> 50:01.220
I mean, they're still making it.

50:01.220 --> 50:01.940
It's just not being-

50:01.940 --> 50:03.780
They're still making it.

50:03.780 --> 50:05.460
We still make home improvement.

50:06.020 --> 50:07.060
You might not see it.

50:08.020 --> 50:08.900
It was part of that.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.980
You know how we have a strategic oil reserve?

50:10.980 --> 50:13.220
We have a strategic reserve of home improvement episodes.

50:15.060 --> 50:17.060
The price of home improvement is so high.

50:17.060 --> 50:18.660
We have got to bring it down.

50:18.660 --> 50:20.260
Somebody send out some VHSs.

50:21.140 --> 50:26.020
Well, ever since the war in Libya started and Muammar Gaddafi started like hoarding

50:26.020 --> 50:30.900
his home improvement, like we've had to start slowly releasing our home improvement to keep

50:30.900 --> 50:32.340
the costs down.

50:32.340 --> 50:33.620
Hey, we don't-

50:33.620 --> 50:35.780
Guess what, Mr. President?

50:35.780 --> 50:40.580
We don't approve of trading young soldiers' blood for episodes of home improvement.

50:41.540 --> 50:41.940
Yeah.

50:41.940 --> 50:43.220
That is not acceptable.

50:45.300 --> 50:47.460
Do you know how we're going to fix that situation in Libya, though?

50:47.460 --> 50:47.940
For real?

50:48.980 --> 50:50.420
Do you know how we're going to fix it?

50:50.420 --> 50:51.700
How we're going to air it out?

50:51.700 --> 50:52.420
How, Griffin?

50:53.380 --> 50:54.420
Wait, I have a guess.

50:54.420 --> 50:54.920
How?

50:56.100 --> 50:56.740
More power?

50:56.740 --> 51:01.060
Yes!

51:01.060 --> 51:03.060
Here, let's do some actual PSAs.

51:04.500 --> 51:05.060
Hey, hey-

51:06.180 --> 51:06.820
Well, that's not-

51:06.820 --> 51:08.020
PSAs don't start out with hey.

51:08.020 --> 51:09.300
They're really that conversation.

51:09.300 --> 51:09.940
We'll do it anyway.

51:10.500 --> 51:15.540
Hey, if you see Zachary Ty Bryan on the street, why don't you give him a buck or two?

51:16.580 --> 51:17.860
He could really use the help.

51:17.860 --> 51:18.660
My brother, my brother.

51:20.260 --> 51:24.900
I know it seems like a good idea at the time, but don't put a V8 engine in a dishwasher.

51:24.900 --> 51:26.580
It only leads to pain.

51:26.580 --> 51:27.780
My brother, my brother, and me.

51:30.100 --> 51:31.140
My brother, my brother, and me.

51:32.180 --> 51:34.580
Richard Karn is swag as fuck.

51:35.700 --> 51:36.820
My brother, my brother, and me.

51:39.540 --> 51:42.740
Dude, don't let Richard Karn turn into the next Ray Combs.

51:42.740 --> 51:44.660
Tell him how much you appreciate him today.

51:44.660 --> 51:45.860
My brother, my brother, and me.

51:45.860 --> 51:47.460
Have you hugged a Richard Karn today?

51:48.500 --> 51:48.820
We think-

51:48.820 --> 51:50.100
Can't find your keys?

51:50.100 --> 51:51.460
Check Richard Karn's beard.

51:51.460 --> 51:56.180
My brother, my brother, and me.

51:56.180 --> 51:58.820
Did you put my keys up there again, Dick Karn?

52:00.500 --> 52:03.220
I put my keys in Dick Karn's beard in 1994.

52:03.860 --> 52:05.220
They were never seen again.

52:06.100 --> 52:07.380
That's where we keep the reserves.

52:09.540 --> 52:11.940
That'd be a good thing to shout after a touchdown.

52:11.940 --> 52:13.140
It's just Richard Karn's name.

52:14.100 --> 52:14.600
Karn?

52:15.460 --> 52:17.540
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

52:17.540 --> 52:22.740
But first, Travis is going to tell you about some of our housekeeping items.

52:22.740 --> 52:23.700
Well, thank you, Justin.

52:24.340 --> 52:27.140
So coming up, I think most of you know by this point,

52:27.140 --> 52:29.780
I hope that we have a live show coming up in Chicago.

52:31.540 --> 52:36.100
You can go to MaximumFund.org for ticket information and stuff like that.

52:36.100 --> 52:40.180
So if there's still tickets available, you should probably go ahead and buy them.

52:40.180 --> 52:41.460
That's the worst pitch ever.

52:43.140 --> 52:45.860
What else are you doing on April 17th?

52:45.860 --> 52:46.740
It's going to be us.

52:46.740 --> 52:49.060
It's going to be JJ Go at Second City.

52:49.060 --> 52:50.260
It's going to be fucking killer.

52:50.260 --> 52:51.460
It's going to be the best night ever.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.580
This party is going to be so fun, you will die.

52:55.220 --> 52:56.420
Dan Telfer is going to be there?

52:56.420 --> 52:57.460
Dan Telfer is going to be there.

52:57.460 --> 52:58.980
So goddamn funny.

52:58.980 --> 53:00.100
Go buy a ticket, dummy.

53:00.100 --> 53:01.780
It's $12, and it's my birthday.

53:03.300 --> 53:04.260
Come see Griffin for his birthday.

53:04.260 --> 53:05.460
Come see me on my birthday.

53:05.460 --> 53:06.820
We're going to go out afterwards.

53:06.820 --> 53:08.820
I'm going to die on drinks.

53:08.820 --> 53:09.700
My dad's going to be there.

53:09.700 --> 53:10.740
We're going to hang out.

53:11.620 --> 53:12.340
Okay, chill.

53:12.340 --> 53:12.980
It's going to be me.

53:12.980 --> 53:13.540
It's going to be Justin.

53:13.540 --> 53:16.420
It's going to be Travis, Dan Telfer, Jordan, Jesse,

53:16.420 --> 53:18.660
and my dad, and we're all hanging.

53:18.660 --> 53:19.540
Where are you?

53:19.540 --> 53:21.940
You're not there because you didn't pay $12 for a ticket

53:21.940 --> 53:22.580
because you're a dummy.

53:22.580 --> 53:23.380
Cheapo.

53:23.380 --> 53:23.940
You're a dummy.

53:23.940 --> 53:24.820
All right, that was good.

53:24.820 --> 53:25.220
And you hate birthday.

53:25.220 --> 53:25.940
That was a good pitch.

53:27.220 --> 53:30.500
If you're going to be there, you want a question answered,

53:31.460 --> 53:32.020
email us.

53:33.140 --> 53:35.060
We want you to email us a question.

53:35.060 --> 53:36.660
If you're going to be at the Chicago show,

53:36.660 --> 53:38.900
put something in the subject like Chicago live question

53:38.900 --> 53:40.820
or something so we know what it is.

53:40.820 --> 53:42.660
Because we, and then we'll humiliate you.

53:43.540 --> 53:44.660
We will savage you.

53:44.660 --> 53:46.260
Yeah, but it'll be a good time.

53:46.260 --> 53:47.140
I don't mind.

53:47.140 --> 53:47.780
It'll be fun.

53:47.780 --> 53:48.580
This is my birthday.

53:48.580 --> 53:49.380
My dad will be there.

53:49.940 --> 53:53.220
Also, if you're interested in becoming a citizen of the Money

53:53.220 --> 53:57.300
Zone, getting your Money Zone green card with Gerard Depardieu,

53:58.180 --> 54:00.660
then you're going to want to contact Teresa Thorne.

54:01.620 --> 54:04.020
And that's Teresa at maxfund.org.

54:04.020 --> 54:05.140
And that's Teresa with an H.

54:05.940 --> 54:08.900
And she'll give you all the pricing info and availability

54:08.900 --> 54:09.620
and stuff like that.

54:10.500 --> 54:11.300
And just let her know.

54:11.300 --> 54:12.900
And you guys should totes hook that up.

54:14.580 --> 54:15.220
Totes.

54:15.220 --> 54:15.940
What?

54:15.940 --> 54:18.100
You should like totally hook that up.

54:19.700 --> 54:21.060
If you do this, you get a free tote bag.

54:22.340 --> 54:23.060
No, that's not true.

54:24.820 --> 54:26.100
You get a totes umbrella.

54:27.060 --> 54:29.780
What if I want to talk about how uncomfortable it made me

54:29.780 --> 54:31.220
that you just said totes hook it up?

54:31.780 --> 54:32.900
What should I got to do that?

54:32.900 --> 54:36.580
You should go to the forums on maximumfund.org and talk about

54:36.580 --> 54:40.020
this episode and other episodes from other max fund shows and

54:40.020 --> 54:40.900
stuff like that.

54:40.900 --> 54:44.660
Or just use it to connect with people and hang out and build

54:44.660 --> 54:47.300
like a community and stuff.

54:47.300 --> 54:48.340
I'm not very good at these.

54:48.340 --> 54:48.740
I love it.

54:48.740 --> 54:50.020
I'm really bad at these.

54:50.740 --> 54:51.780
Just finish it up.

54:51.780 --> 54:52.340
Just finish it up.

54:52.340 --> 54:53.860
Finish it up.

54:53.860 --> 54:55.300
Also, we're on Twitter.

54:55.300 --> 54:59.540
We're on Twitter, you know, at MBMBAM if you want to send us

54:59.540 --> 55:00.020
a message.

55:00.020 --> 55:04.180
But we prefer that you use hashtag MBMBAM for any messages

55:04.180 --> 55:07.940
about the show, you know, quotes from the show, anything

55:07.940 --> 55:08.420
like that.

55:09.540 --> 55:11.060
Let us know if you're going to be at the live show.

55:11.060 --> 55:14.660
It's exciting to find out people are excited about it.

55:14.660 --> 55:18.580
We're also all individually on there, but, you know, we're not

55:18.580 --> 55:19.940
as funny separate.

55:19.940 --> 55:20.980
We're like Voltron.

55:21.780 --> 55:22.980
I don't know about that.

55:22.980 --> 55:23.480
No?

55:24.420 --> 55:28.260
Well, I get drunk and solicit Yahoo answers eight times in a

55:28.260 --> 55:29.060
single night.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.420
I think that's pretty fucking funny.

55:31.060 --> 55:32.100
It's follow worthy.

55:32.100 --> 55:34.180
I'd say that's very followable.

55:34.740 --> 55:38.260
Some people have been hooking us up with shout outs on Twitter

55:38.260 --> 55:41.700
this week, like green cardigan five converted a friend.

55:42.740 --> 55:44.100
That's my chunks.

55:44.100 --> 55:47.460
Our buddy Fred says episode 15 is the best starter for a new

55:47.460 --> 55:47.960
fan.

55:47.960 --> 55:50.100
Michelle Mittens is just the best.

55:50.100 --> 55:56.580
Always 100% Sean MD listens to eight episodes in a row.

55:57.300 --> 55:58.100
He's a doctor.

55:58.100 --> 55:58.900
He's a physician.

55:59.860 --> 56:01.460
That's a terrible listen to eight episodes.

56:01.460 --> 56:04.020
He shouldn't be qualified to touch people after two.

56:04.020 --> 56:06.820
I got a prescription.

56:06.820 --> 56:07.860
Slow down.

56:07.860 --> 56:08.100
Yeah.

56:08.100 --> 56:08.980
You got a problem.

56:09.780 --> 56:10.280
Yeah.

56:10.740 --> 56:14.020
I got to diagnose you with a total case of yucks.

56:14.020 --> 56:16.100
Guys, are we trending?

56:17.940 --> 56:18.900
It's hard to say.

56:20.660 --> 56:22.740
How can you how can you monitor that?

56:23.700 --> 56:25.140
I think there's probably an app.

56:27.220 --> 56:29.300
These are the things that are trending right now.

56:30.340 --> 56:30.740
Okay.

56:30.740 --> 56:31.860
Are we any of these things?

56:31.860 --> 56:32.500
Let's see.

56:32.500 --> 56:35.460
Are we hashtag things that piss me off?

56:35.460 --> 56:38.900
Hashtag since we being honest.

56:39.780 --> 56:40.280
Okay.

56:41.700 --> 56:42.980
Hashtag whiz.

56:42.980 --> 56:43.540
Follow me.

56:45.380 --> 56:46.660
Jonas are much better.

56:47.300 --> 56:47.940
Oh, my God.

56:49.380 --> 56:52.180
Lovato World Tour 2011.

56:52.180 --> 56:53.940
Oh, that's us.

56:53.940 --> 56:54.660
That's actually us.

56:54.660 --> 56:55.860
That's the name of our live show.

56:56.500 --> 56:57.540
Jonas are much better.

56:57.540 --> 56:58.740
Here's the top tweet on that one.

57:00.180 --> 57:02.740
Jonas are much better because they taught me that there's more

57:02.740 --> 57:04.980
to life than just to live.

57:04.980 --> 57:08.900
That instead of just hoping, I need to start trying.

57:10.340 --> 57:11.300
Thanks, JoBros.

57:11.940 --> 57:12.900
Thanks for the message.

57:14.580 --> 57:15.540
JoBros changed me.

57:16.100 --> 57:16.820
All right.

57:16.820 --> 57:18.740
Griffin in this show.

57:18.740 --> 57:22.660
This final question, which by the way, guys, thanks for sticking around.

57:22.660 --> 57:23.540
This is a weird app.

57:24.740 --> 57:25.700
And you made it to the end.

57:26.340 --> 57:28.660
We'll never do another one like this again, unless Justin's

57:29.460 --> 57:32.580
pussy immune system is fragile, tiny.

57:32.580 --> 57:33.540
Listen to him.

57:33.540 --> 57:35.140
Little pussy baby.

57:37.540 --> 57:37.940
Thank you.

57:38.660 --> 57:39.060
Thank you.

57:39.060 --> 57:39.940
I tried my best.

57:39.940 --> 57:40.980
You did good.

57:40.980 --> 57:42.020
We're all very proud of you.

57:43.060 --> 57:43.780
It's not your fault.

57:43.780 --> 57:44.580
It's your larynx.

57:46.180 --> 57:48.180
This one was sent in by James Oust.

57:48.180 --> 57:48.900
Thank you, James.

57:48.900 --> 57:52.660
It's Yahoo Answers user black Justin Bieber bitches.

57:53.780 --> 57:54.260
Okay.

57:54.980 --> 57:56.580
Yeah, that name really comes right at you.

57:57.380 --> 58:00.420
Says basketball colon.

58:01.060 --> 58:03.300
What is verified swag?

58:03.300 --> 58:04.580
And where can I purchase it?

58:07.460 --> 58:08.180
I'm Justin back.

58:08.180 --> 58:08.820
I'm Travis.

58:09.940 --> 58:11.620
I'm Griffin verified.

58:15.060 --> 58:16.900
My brother, my brother made kiss your dad.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.380
Keep your heart.

58:23.380 --> 58:24.260
Three stacks.

58:24.260 --> 58:25.220
Keep your heart.

58:25.220 --> 58:26.500
Hey, keep your heart.

58:26.500 --> 58:27.380
Three stacks.

58:27.380 --> 58:28.420
Keep your heart.

58:28.420 --> 58:28.740
Man.

58:28.740 --> 58:29.700
These girls are smart.

58:29.700 --> 58:30.340
Three stacks.

58:30.340 --> 58:31.460
These girls are smart.

58:31.460 --> 58:32.820
Keep your heart.

58:32.820 --> 59:02.580
Keep your heart.
