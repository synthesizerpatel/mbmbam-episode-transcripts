00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:51.040
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me. I am Justin McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.320
I'm Travis McElroy. What? What's going on?

00:56.320 --> 01:04.640
Hello Griffin, I believe this is a podcast. You see, when I was-

01:04.640 --> 01:06.240
Justin, what is this new character?

01:06.240 --> 01:10.960
It's like some sort of like, if John Waters was living in a cave for two decades.

01:12.640 --> 01:19.280
No, while I was, I've been without electricity for a week,

01:19.920 --> 01:23.760
and while I was without electricity, I started reading books.

01:23.760 --> 01:27.680
Oh, I, okay, so this is, this is books, man.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.320
This is educated Justin.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.560
This is your, this is your brain on books. This is what they do.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.280
So in your mind, this is what educated people sound like?

01:37.280 --> 01:45.920
They, I, in, in circles, I am in electoral circles. This is what my friends and I,

01:45.920 --> 01:47.840
this is how we speak.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.880
Justin, I want you to know, I picture you right now surrounded by bookcases,

01:50.880 --> 01:55.360
but your brain has swollen and you just have like a giant forehead.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.000
Tell me.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.760
I have become top heavy.

01:58.720 --> 02:04.320
With this voice, did you inherit a proclivity for going to community pools and not swimming?

02:05.040 --> 02:08.960
Just sort of standing on the sidelines and just sort of soaking it in, soaking into you.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.680
I have, let me put it this way.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.760
I have memorized the different popsicle flavors available at the concessions.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.200
Oh no.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.120
It is, yes.

02:21.120 --> 02:27.120
It's very, in part, everyone's trying to beat the heat, they say.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.560
But without electricity, I was not able to watch my programs.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.360
I was not able to play video games.

02:36.080 --> 02:42.240
And I was forced to read, and now I've been exposed to all the great culture of the world.

02:43.760 --> 02:48.000
How, how sallow is your skin?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.480
Can you give me some sort of sallowness rating?

02:51.040 --> 02:53.280
It looks like an orange fruit.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.000
What?

02:58.560 --> 03:00.400
Did you get book jaundice?

03:00.400 --> 03:01.120
What happened?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.360
No, he was just reading books and eating carrots the entire time.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.720
As they ran out of power, they had to eat their stock of baby carrots.

03:08.720 --> 03:15.920
I was forced, I was forced to eat the butterflies I've preserved over the years behind glass.

03:15.920 --> 03:24.720
Nutritionally devoid, but surprisingly very pleasing to the palate.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.400
Yeah, yeah.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.080
All that voice wants to do is eat something beautiful.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.000
So this is our advice program.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.720
My brother, my brother and me will dole out intellectual conversational advice.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.400
He writes hard right.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.160
What is this voice doing?

03:48.160 --> 03:51.040
I think he was just, I think he's turning into a condor also.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.360
It's bucking underneath me.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.480
Bucking wildly.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.120
It wants desperately to go to Scar's garden.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.240
I won't let it.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.840
I'm holding onto the reins as sadly as I can.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.640
Oh God, it's devolved into Ed Grimley.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.000
Somebody help me.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.400
I think it started at Grimley and went down from there.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.840
Started at Grimley and went down from there.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.640
Hey everybody, this is our advice show.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.840
I've been exposed to the internet now for 15 minutes and I'm dumb again.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.320
That's enough time fooling.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.920
Let's get deep into the advice.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.000
You know, that was the original title for Back to the Future.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.000
Time fooling with your buddies, Dr. Doc.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.440
Dr. Doc and Marty McMarty.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.080
And Martin.

04:38.080 --> 04:46.320
Martin, one of the characters in Dawson's Creek is this hyper literate bartender who

04:46.880 --> 04:50.160
it's a very good will hunting sort of vibe, especially since they're in Boston.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.120
And he wears exactly Marty McFly's outfit and no one ever comments on it.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.560
He was fully wearing like orange vest with blue denim shirt.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.560
And like no one calls him out like, hey, you're dressed like Marty McFly.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.400
Get it together, Dawson's Creek bartender.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.680
Um, let's all, let's thank, thank you.

05:10.320 --> 05:15.600
Thank you listeners for being so patient with us after we got so, so blasted by the derache.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.400
The derache took me down.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.800
The derache just, it, it, it kissed Travis.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.760
I didn't see it.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.680
You know what, let's do the first question.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.040
Cause I think it'll tie in.

05:27.040 --> 05:27.280
Okay.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.960
What do you do in case of a prolonged power outage to stay sane?

05:32.960 --> 05:37.760
I've been drinking, playing guitar and reading dark tower graphic novels by daylight,

05:38.320 --> 05:39.760
but daylight is waning.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.120
However, I'd rather be playing video games or editing a podcast help.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.040
Board games are not an option and I have no light by which to read.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.000
That's from Cole Ross.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.120
Now, Cole Ross, I know that you are in Cincinnati because you came to our live show.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.480
So we lost power here.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.520
I don't know, two, three days.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.720
Like we, we were without it in my home for about nine hours and there were people in

06:04.720 --> 06:07.200
town that were without it for three or four days.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.920
And Justin, you went without it for.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.520
It came back.

06:11.520 --> 06:15.520
It went out Friday at, let me describe to you the store.

06:15.520 --> 06:20.080
Cause like, I think people hear like a storm and they think like, oh, this was like nothing

06:20.080 --> 06:21.600
I've ever seen before.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.800
We were driving downtown to go to a black sheep, the delightful burrito place in the

06:26.800 --> 06:34.480
downtown Huntington area and it literally looked like this wall of black clouds that

06:34.480 --> 06:36.880
were, that were moving sort of swiftly towards us.

06:36.880 --> 06:42.480
But as you got downtown there on third Avenue, there's like a, it's sort of industrial

06:42.480 --> 06:43.600
right next to the university.

06:44.480 --> 06:51.120
And there are like these dust clouds blowing from the industrial thing and like making

06:51.120 --> 06:52.720
it almost impossible to see.

06:52.720 --> 06:59.600
And then all of a sudden like a paper starts flying everywhere and rocks and like signs

06:59.600 --> 07:00.720
are blowing over.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.400
And I mean, it, it took, it did like some serious damage in some parts of this.

07:04.400 --> 07:09.280
I mean, it took out like there are whole signs that were pulled off and like the the sporting

07:09.280 --> 07:12.480
goods store glens, like it tore its whole awning off.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.680
Like it was crazy.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.840
We were getting hit with 90 mile an hour winds.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.720
It flipped a plane in Charles at the Charleston airport.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.560
And they had to like get a crew to come pick it up.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.440
It was insane.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.200
So like we have not only do we not have the infrastructure for that, like we don't have

07:27.200 --> 07:28.880
power lines underneath the ground or anything.

07:28.880 --> 07:35.200
We have like, it hit so many places that we couldn't just like call better states and

07:35.200 --> 07:37.120
be like, Hey, are we done?

07:37.120 --> 07:38.400
We done did it again guys.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.160
Ready to take on our refugees.

07:40.160 --> 07:40.720
Yeah.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.280
Please come bring us ice and skull.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.360
Bring us snooze.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.040
Sweet snooze from Kentucky.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.720
I need snooze from Kentucky.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.600
And they're like, listen, we got our own derecho related problems over here.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.480
You can't have our snooze.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.800
So that was crazy.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.120
And I was without power for it.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.160
And I didn't.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.120
This shows you how like dependent I am on the grid.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.920
I didn't even realize that you could be without power for a week.

08:09.920 --> 08:16.400
I guess I just assumed like President Obama would come save me or something like, listen,

08:16.400 --> 08:17.920
this has gone far enough.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.120
Let's go save Justin.

08:19.120 --> 08:23.600
Up to this point, whenever I lost power, I always pictured it like when you blow a breaker

08:23.600 --> 08:27.040
and you have to like go down to the basement and there's just a giant switch somewhere

08:27.040 --> 08:30.480
that somebody in a hard hat goes over and they got to pull it down and push it back

08:30.480 --> 08:30.960
up.

08:30.960 --> 08:31.440
Yeah.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.800
And then power kicks back on.

08:32.800 --> 08:37.440
When I was growing up and we used to lose power and like we would call the power company.

08:38.160 --> 08:44.160
I don't know why, but it always occurred to me that they would go, Oh, Oh, I had no idea.

08:44.160 --> 08:44.560
Okay.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.160
Well, I guess we'll check it out.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.720
You mean the thing that we supply to the state?

08:48.720 --> 08:51.600
The thing, the only thing that we supply to the state, we're not doing it?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.040
The one product we produce.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.240
Oh, I'm glad you told us because we don't have meters.

08:56.240 --> 09:01.520
Be the dude who answers the phone when you lose power to like an entire eastern seaboard.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.120
I don't know if you know this, but there's no power.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.000
Like, yeah, I know.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.040
So here's how I dealt with it.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.280
Day one was sort of charming.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.280
It was also, we were having a record heat wave here.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.880
I should also mention that day one was almost sort of nice.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.440
You know, we were enjoying each other's company.

09:25.440 --> 09:30.800
My wife and I came back to the house and we sat outside with a bottle of wine and some candles.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.840
It was almost romantic.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.760
And that lasted until the next morning when the power was still out.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.960
And then we lost our minds and went to Louisville for two days because we couldn't handle it.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.320
We had to escape the storm.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.440
I mean, to give you some idea of how bad it was, like, you couldn't buy.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.800
I went to a pump and tried to buy gas and it didn't have any in it.

09:49.440 --> 09:49.680
What?

09:50.560 --> 09:50.800
Yeah.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.800
It's always supposed to work.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.360
That's the one constant is I know I can get more gas.

09:55.360 --> 09:55.920
I had to get-

09:55.920 --> 09:59.680
You instantly feel like you were in a zombie movie because I've had people describe to me

09:59.680 --> 10:04.960
being out of gas in West Virginia and it sounds like the beginning of an apocalypse.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.640
Yeah, it's, well, and everybody, here's the thing that's so weird about it.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.080
There's no reason for everybody to get all this gas.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.600
We're not out of gas.

10:13.600 --> 10:18.560
If it was like the electricity store got us a fresh supply in, go get it.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.720
And I mean, like, some people have generators, but-

10:20.720 --> 10:21.760
It was panic.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.560
Just panic.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.280
That's exactly it.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.160
People were freaking out.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.480
And like, I was, I know why I needed gas because the only way I had to charge my cell phone

10:28.480 --> 10:29.760
was plug in the car adapter.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.680
I know that's like the least efficient charging method ever.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.240
But I don't know, man.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.280
I wish I had an answer for you.

10:37.280 --> 10:37.920
I lost it.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.480
I lost it.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.320
I couldn't get it together.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.520
I was without power for nine hours and I couldn't stand it.

10:43.520 --> 10:47.840
Like, I was doing a show at the time, so I was downtown and we had power there.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.880
And when I came back, I called Theresa and we were still without power here.

10:51.520 --> 10:55.520
And so I was like, okay, well, I'll grab something, you know, I'll grab some fast food

10:55.520 --> 10:57.920
or something so that we can actually eat dinner.

10:58.800 --> 11:04.000
I had to drive all over town to find somebody with power enough to make me a hamburger.

11:04.720 --> 11:09.040
And there were lines around the block to get into the Wendy's.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.320
Because they had hamburger power?

11:12.320 --> 11:13.920
Because they had hamburger power.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.120
We have enough watts to produce 10 burgers.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.720
They're a hundred dollars each.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.240
Please don't tell Dave Thomas.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.440
I don't know if you guys know this.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.240
Candles do not produce a lot of light.

11:26.240 --> 11:26.800
Yeah.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.560
You can't do shit by candlelight.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.560
Yeah, nothing you can, well, I know one thing.

11:31.280 --> 11:31.680
What?

11:31.680 --> 11:34.080
That's, oh, nevermind.

11:34.080 --> 11:34.800
What is it, Dustin?

11:34.800 --> 11:36.240
Fucking reading.

11:36.240 --> 11:41.200
I thought you were talking about your desires.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.560
I thought you were talking about fucking.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.000
Oh, gross.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.800
So those are the two things you can do.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.760
So eat hamburgers and fuck.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.680
People did it for hundreds of years, I guess.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.640
Maybe even thousands.

11:54.640 --> 11:59.360
As many as thousands of years without electricity before electricity was invented.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.360
But like, our brains aren't built that way anymore.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.840
I don't have a brain for that kind of thing.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.400
Here's the thing.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.360
I was driving around and you take for granted how much light there is in the world at night.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.960
Street lights, house lights, Porsche lights.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.960
I couldn't see stop signs.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.240
I couldn't see intersections.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.560
It was the cone around my car that was headlights.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.880
It was terrifying.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.680
I was so afraid I was going to just hit somebody having no idea they were there.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.800
I don't understand why this guy's counting out board games from the jump.

12:30.800 --> 12:35.600
Like, if my power ever goes out, it's like, oh yeah, it's board game time.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.840
It's like an excuse to play board games.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.880
I don't understand why you would want to discount that right away.

12:40.880 --> 12:41.760
I don't think you should.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.320
Clue can get really scared.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.280
Oh, I know.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.080
Because he's alone.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.400
Well, guess what?

12:48.960 --> 12:50.160
You can play Mastermind.

12:54.720 --> 12:58.160
I guarantee you play Mastermind, you're going to forget what your pegs were instantly.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.960
What if it's like a Mastermind drinking game?

13:00.960 --> 13:02.000
You set up the board, right?

13:02.000 --> 13:06.800
And then you take like 10 shots of tequila, and then you sit down to play against yourself.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.040
Yeah, it's called, it's called Mastermind.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.280
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

13:15.600 --> 13:16.640
Yes, absolutely.

13:16.640 --> 13:20.000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Alexander Hawk or Hatch.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.560
One of those two.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.280
Thanks, Alexander.

13:21.280 --> 13:26.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Av, who asks, question about smelling?

13:27.200 --> 13:28.000
Okay.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.440
Hi, okay, I have a question about smelling air like with your nose.

13:32.640 --> 13:39.120
Okay, so like, I never thought about it, but what if you breathe in a lot of stink air?

13:41.280 --> 13:47.360
Does the stink air lodge itself into your lungs and you get the smell inside of you

13:47.360 --> 13:49.600
until the end of time, AKA forever?

13:50.560 --> 13:55.520
Because I went to a farm last year and there was a bit cow poo and I smelt it

13:55.520 --> 13:59.920
and I still smell it sometimes.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.440
Additional details.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.640
I saw it on the news.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.040
Okay.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.160
So this gentleman is worried about eternal smell.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.120
Yeah.

14:09.120 --> 14:14.400
He's worried about the smell getting inside of him and living forever, AKA the end of time.

14:15.360 --> 14:19.360
Actually, this is, this phenomenon is well known.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.160
We just call it something different, memories.

14:22.160 --> 14:22.560
Yeah.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.080
That's how, this is how memory works is you get a smell inside of you

14:26.640 --> 14:30.960
and it never lets itself go, let's self out.

14:30.960 --> 14:35.280
And then, it's actually my favorite kind of memory and sense memory.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.000
And it's like when you smell something and it connects to something else,

14:38.000 --> 14:43.760
but I really want to know what kind of memory is attached to the smell of cow poop.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.680
Cause wouldn't that be like the worst sense memory?

14:45.680 --> 14:49.520
Every time you smell cow poop, you think of that girl you made love to on the farm.

14:50.160 --> 14:50.720
Yeah.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.840
Why does that doesn't make it?

14:51.840 --> 14:53.760
Why would that, why would the smell of,

14:53.760 --> 14:57.920
you should never ever connect the smell of poop and sex in your mind at the same time.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.480
If you, if you smell poop, you can't have sex.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.520
Like that's the rules.

15:01.520 --> 15:07.040
You say, well, listen, baby, you're a red and white checked shirt

15:07.040 --> 15:09.120
that you've tied into a knot in front of you.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.600
Like farmer's daughters do look so sexy.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.160
And I know I'm a traveling hairbrush salesman.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.080
I'm a traveling hairbrush salesman.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.560
But listen, it smells like poopy right here.

15:18.560 --> 15:22.320
You're giving me, you're giving me come hither eyes, but the air around you

15:22.320 --> 15:23.760
is giving me go away.

15:23.760 --> 15:24.720
Run, run, run eyes.

15:25.680 --> 15:29.680
I know your, your father, the farmer told me not to touch you,

15:29.680 --> 15:31.200
his beautiful virginal daughter.

15:31.920 --> 15:35.760
And I should be moseying along to, I don't know, Piscataway or someplace like that.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.960
The traveling salesman go, but I smell poop.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.920
Is that just me?

15:39.920 --> 15:40.800
Is that just me?

15:40.800 --> 15:41.840
I like to mosey.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.040
I'm going to Albuquerque.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.080
Albuquerque.

15:44.080 --> 15:44.960
Albuquerque.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.640
Albuquerque.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.040
I, I don't know guys.

15:49.040 --> 15:53.440
I still, I used a port-a-john at Bonnaroo on the last day once.

15:55.200 --> 16:00.720
And that's, that, that smell is like, I still, it comes up from time to time.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.120
And it's not like I think about Bonnaroo and then I get the smell.

16:03.120 --> 16:07.280
It's like, it lives in like my shoulder blade or something.

16:07.280 --> 16:11.600
And every once in a while, if I jostle it, I'll break the seal and it'll come back to me.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.960
I think the smell lives inside me forever and ever at the end of time.

16:14.960 --> 16:19.440
Now, did you think this before you read this question or is it just an idea?

16:19.440 --> 16:25.600
It's a problem I deal with every single day, but it's okay because sometimes I'll like be

16:25.600 --> 16:29.760
walking down the street and I'll get a whiff of Heiners Bakery, which is in Huntington.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.760
And I haven't been to ever.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.120
I've just driven by it 10 years ago.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.040
You just driven by it and it gets stuck in your knee.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.880
You get that smell on my knee.

16:36.880 --> 16:37.680
I am a man.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.760
I am composed of smells basically.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.120
I think everybody is made.

16:41.120 --> 16:41.280
Yeah.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.760
Everybody is basically made of smells.

16:43.760 --> 16:49.040
You know, it's something you learn in psychology that basically you, the you that is you is

16:49.040 --> 16:54.480
just a, you know, it's just a building of all the smells you've ever smelled in your life.

16:54.480 --> 16:54.720
Right.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.320
That's how you get your personality.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.600
Your personality is just based on a collection of smells.

16:59.600 --> 16:59.840
Yeah.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.800
That's why people who like make barbecue for a living are like so jovial.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.800
It's because they are made of barbecue smells.

17:07.360 --> 17:07.520
Right.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.000
Do you remember that time that you laughed at wedding crashers?

17:10.000 --> 17:15.440
You found that funny because of that time that you smelled barbecue when you were in Memphis.

17:15.440 --> 17:15.680
Yeah.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.320
Wait, how are those two ideas connected?

17:18.880 --> 17:22.800
Well, smelling the barbecue gave you the ability to find things funny.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.040
Yeah.

17:24.880 --> 17:28.960
I'm, that's why, that is why Amish people are so bitter.

17:28.960 --> 17:35.600
I'm actually a strong proponent of completely and totally dismantling our public school system

17:35.600 --> 17:41.680
and just creating these facilities where you come in and you plug in some sort of oxygen

17:41.680 --> 17:47.280
apparatus into your nose, sort of like an oxygen bar and then instead of making children

17:47.280 --> 17:52.640
read traditional books and receive tutelage from professors, they just get steak smells

17:52.640 --> 17:56.080
blown into their face, into their face holes or maybe not even steak.

17:56.080 --> 18:01.440
Maybe it's a, you know, fresh bun cotton candy or a funnel cake or maybe instead of

18:01.440 --> 18:05.760
getting sent to the principal's office, you put a little poop in there, you know?

18:05.760 --> 18:07.120
This is in your body now forever.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.080
I'm sorry, Steve, you're going to get 30 seconds of poop.

18:10.080 --> 18:10.240
Yeah.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.720
You're going in the poop.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.560
The poop chokie is what we'll call it.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.800
This is why kids in Africa always look so sad in all those show this commercials because

18:18.800 --> 18:20.960
all they ever smelled is zebras and dust.

18:21.680 --> 18:25.200
Yeah, that's probably the two smells that they have.

18:25.200 --> 18:29.760
I remember when I first read the book, The Giver, and I thought that is what we're talking

18:29.760 --> 18:32.320
about. That's so good, Travis.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.600
That's not in Africa.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.600
Well, I was just thinking of sharing smells with people.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.560
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.200
Nobody there can remember anything except for one guy.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.320
They don't even see colors.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.440
He does all the smells for everybody and he gives them to people.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.600
I remember that time I taught a young African child what sledding was.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.120
And it was pretty epic.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.880
Through the smell of fresh store-bought sled.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.520
And you can read in my biography, What's That Smell?

18:55.520 --> 18:56.880
The Story of Travis McElroy.

18:56.880 --> 19:02.480
Can you keep a sachet of some sort of certain smell that will teach someone to love our

19:02.480 --> 19:04.400
podcast that you just carry around with you?

19:04.400 --> 19:08.560
He just carries around a lot of glass baubles and you open them.

19:08.560 --> 19:12.800
I'm going to juggle these baubles like Jared from Labyrinth and then I'd like to crack

19:12.800 --> 19:15.200
one open for you if you could just inhale this perfume.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.920
I'm a merchant of exotic perfumes.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.520
Please enjoy this eau de toilette.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.880
If you inhale it, it will make you a much better typer.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.400
It does smell like Wendy's.

19:26.400 --> 19:26.800
That's right.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.600
It smells like Wendy's.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.280
Enjoy the Wendy's memories.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.400
These are my Wendy's memories.

19:33.120 --> 19:40.000
The plot of Labyrinth 2 is me trying to go find Jared.

19:40.000 --> 19:49.440
It's just Justin wondering the streets of Huntington with a bunch of mason jars yelling

19:49.440 --> 19:50.640
for David Bowie.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.920
I never- and people ask me like, have you been to Wendy's?

19:53.920 --> 19:56.720
I have no memory.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.080
If I have, I don't recall ever having gone to Wendy's.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.760
It seems like I would go.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.200
They're pretty prevalent.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.440
But Jared stole all the memories.

20:05.440 --> 20:09.600
I'll eat no chicken sandwich, no nuggets, nothing.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.440
I don't remember a single Frosty because Jared stole all my Wendy's memories.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.840
Dance, dance, Wendy's dance.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.240
Jump, Wendy's jump.

20:20.240 --> 20:24.160
Uh, you remind me of the crispy chicken sandwich.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.080
Which crispy chicken sandwich?

20:26.080 --> 20:29.040
The power of Dave Thomas.

20:29.040 --> 20:29.280
Fuck.

20:31.440 --> 20:35.520
I'm gonna need to take a two hour break here so I can go watch Labyrinth again.

20:35.520 --> 20:40.000
I need a 30 minute break to go eat Wendy's and then poop it out, which is about how long

20:40.000 --> 20:43.760
it takes to do that for one day.

20:43.760 --> 20:49.200
What if the smell of a certain food made you forget the fact that you ate it and you would

20:49.200 --> 20:50.720
be locked forever?

20:50.720 --> 20:52.640
And like, my belly seems fuller.

20:52.640 --> 20:56.240
Yeah, I'm dead like that guy in Seven.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.600
This gazpacho looks great though.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.640
I can't wait to eat it.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.040
I can't believe I got to drive back to Wendy's.

21:03.040 --> 21:03.680
What's Wendy's?

21:03.680 --> 21:04.720
I've never heard of it.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.240
Oh shit, Labyrinth 2.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.920
Tagline.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.800
Come get the new Inception Burger.

21:10.800 --> 21:16.160
Come get the new Inception Burger and remember that time that your uncle died.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.560
Whenever I go out of town, my roommate likes to bone down in my bed.

21:20.560 --> 21:26.000
I've been told by friends of mine, and I also know he has gotten some mouth action

21:26.000 --> 21:26.880
in my closet.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.760
Oh, come on.

21:29.760 --> 21:30.080
What?

21:30.800 --> 21:34.240
I've tried locking my door, but it's pretty easy to unlock.

21:37.120 --> 21:40.320
Is there anything I can do about this or do I have to sleep with it?

21:40.320 --> 21:41.520
Any suggestions?

21:41.520 --> 21:43.200
And that's from Bill Zillionaire.

21:43.200 --> 21:47.920
Your roommate is the worst asshole I've ever heard.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.680
He's addicted to it, right?

21:50.800 --> 21:54.080
Like you lock your door and you're like, please don't have sex in my room.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.360
I've locked the door, please don't.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.640
And he's like, okay, you got it.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.800
And then you dip, and he's like, I cannot wait.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.080
And he breaks down your door.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.320
That's breaking and entering and mouth action.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.560
Girl, you look so fucking good.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.000
Oh, I'm going to bang you so hard.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.080
Just let me get this lock open.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.560
I got to take you on David's bed.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.400
This is not my bed kind of action.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.840
If I don't do it on David's bed action.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.240
If I don't do it on David's bed, then I can't vanish.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.120
Pretend I'm David.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.480
Pretend you're David.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.840
Two Davids in perfect harmony.

22:21.840 --> 22:26.400
There's two Davids in the closet getting mouth action.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.280
Can we stop?

22:27.280 --> 22:29.200
Can we just not say that anymore though?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.160
If we could just not say mouth action.

22:32.160 --> 22:36.160
Mouth action is like when you're like you're scatting or beatboxing.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.000
When you're scatting, that's worse.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.200
Oh, no, no, no, no.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.520
No, no, I'll never forget the smell.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.400
Oh, man.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.920
Why is your roommate such a freak?

22:46.640 --> 22:47.360
He loves it.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.400
I'm not just a freak, but like you locked your door.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.760
It's like the quintessential like boundary issue.

22:53.760 --> 22:59.840
This is, this is such a, this is like one of those things that is so, such a big deal.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.720
That it informs so much else about this person.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.560
Like this is not a good guy.

23:06.560 --> 23:13.920
Like you can't, I don't care if he makes muffins every single morning and like save your, save

23:13.920 --> 23:14.320
your.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.520
Here's some fresh muffins.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.120
I look forward to fucking in your bed when you leave for the weekend.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.480
I don't care if this dude like saved your dad from a house fire.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.640
Like, yeah, there's no excuse.

23:25.840 --> 23:31.600
But the good news is, as with every question on my brother, my brother, me, I have a solution.

23:31.600 --> 23:31.920
Okay.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.320
You ready?

23:32.320 --> 23:35.520
One word, lice.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.560
No, hold on, stay with me.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.440
You know, you're going away for the weekend.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.680
You put lice in the bed.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.180
Okay.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.680
The girl and the guy get into your bed.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.480
That can't be helped.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.160
They get in your bed.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.720
They, I don't know what people do in beds, but they do it.

23:52.720 --> 23:57.440
And then you, then they leave and the girl has lice.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.160
And then she says, you gave me lice.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.480
I mean, we got to break up.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.560
You're a dirty kid.

24:04.560 --> 24:09.920
And then she calls like the telephone scene and by my birdie, she calls all the girls.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.720
She knows she's like, did you hear the news?

24:12.720 --> 24:19.600
David has lice, but you don't see how this could backfire is if she says David's roommate's

24:19.600 --> 24:20.400
bed has lice.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.440
Oh, you're saying that you're saying that there's a lot of sacrifice going on here.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.760
There is a lot of, it's worth sacrifice.

24:27.760 --> 24:28.000
Yes.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.760
There's a lot of sacrifice going on there.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.640
And you know what?

24:30.640 --> 24:34.320
Part of the sacrifice is that David is going to have to get lice too.

24:34.320 --> 24:37.280
You know, you got to commit to the goof.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.080
You got to commit to the, to this plan we're laying out here.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.800
I think my favorite part of your plan is when you said that they would have to break up

24:44.800 --> 24:49.440
as though his roommate has a girlfriend and the girlfriend's totally okay with fucking

24:49.440 --> 24:51.360
in the other bed.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.720
So why is she just bringing home like random, random skanks?

24:54.720 --> 24:56.000
That's what it sounds like to me.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.920
I mean, like I can't imagine that his roommates been dating this girl for like two years and

24:59.920 --> 25:01.120
they're in a loving relationship.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.600
And every time she comes over, he's like, so you want to do it?

25:03.600 --> 25:04.640
And David's bed.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.880
She's like, yeah, I do.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.000
Why wouldn't I?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.840
You're thinking he's just bringing home random.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.800
It's like, oh yeah, no, no, no.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.080
That's, that's totally me.

25:12.080 --> 25:16.960
That picture is that's me and my, uh, yes, my family is black.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.000
I'm adopted.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.360
And also I used to be black like David, but that's me.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.560
That's totally me.

25:22.560 --> 25:26.640
I really want to be there when this guy like confronts his roommate about this in the room.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.760
It's just like, I gotta be me.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.440
Listen to that.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.440
What if you, what if no boundaries?

25:31.440 --> 25:34.800
I wish I could stop too, but you know, we've all got our hangouts.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.680
We've all got our things.

25:35.680 --> 25:38.560
You know, you like, you don't do the dishes sometimes.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.400
And sometimes I have sex in your bed.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.880
Like we all got idiosyncrasies.

25:42.880 --> 25:50.560
What I think you should do is, uh, do dishes in the bathtub and pee in his laundry hamper

25:50.560 --> 25:52.720
and try to cook eggs on the TV.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.640
And then when he comes home, you'd be like, oh, I, I thought that's just what we do here.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.920
We just like do things in the furniture that we're not supposed to do them in.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.400
I wasn't aware.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.760
That's just something you get to do.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.120
I didn't, I thought.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.440
Next time he has sex on your bed, you burn his bed down.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.280
You set his bed on fire.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.640
Cut it in half with a chainsaw.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.760
Cut it in half with a chainsaw.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.640
If you're not going to use this bed, apparently no one's using this bed.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.480
So I'm going to cut it in half with a chainsaw.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.720
Yeah, this is a continuum household.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.880
We all fucking sleep in one bed.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.640
What if when you left town, you put rubber sheets on your bed?

26:30.640 --> 26:31.920
Ew, grody.

26:31.920 --> 26:32.800
I love it.

26:32.800 --> 26:37.040
And so then when he brings the girl in, all it takes is about three seconds of contact

26:37.040 --> 26:40.000
to your bed before they're like, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.200
Take your mattress with you.

26:41.920 --> 26:42.400
That's good.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.480
I'm going back to my folks place.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.600
Get a Murphy bed.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.160
So when he comes into your room, there's no bed.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.080
You find him in the wall, laid her dead.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.480
What didn't you tell me?

26:54.960 --> 26:55.920
I deserve better than this.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.480
It's like the cask of a matalato for dirty dorm kids.

27:00.080 --> 27:00.960
I'm better than this.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.880
Throw some cold pennies and jacks up in there.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.640
Oh, that's the worst.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.120
People love that.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.240
Oh, we're just crumbs.

27:08.240 --> 27:08.800
Yeah.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.240
Just eat some Funyuns in there.

27:10.240 --> 27:10.800
Like, ugh.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.640
Or cums.

27:14.640 --> 27:22.640
There's so many cums in this bed.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.200
I don't want to be in here or around it.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.040
Install a black light on your ceiling.

27:27.040 --> 27:27.520
Uh-huh.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.120
Get a picture of yourself doing horrific things and just slip it between the sheets.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.680
Get some Buzz Lightyear sheets.

27:33.680 --> 27:40.240
Put a mirror on the ceiling, but on that mirror, stick a giant sticker of yourself,

27:40.240 --> 27:41.680
like looking disapprovingly.

27:41.680 --> 27:46.480
Find a picture of your roommate's mom and then have sheets made that have her face all over it.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.000
Nothing's happened in that bed.

27:51.360 --> 27:57.760
But all these suggestions are contingent on the fact that this roommate is a normal person.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.000
Yeah.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.520
Which, of course, he is not.

27:59.520 --> 28:03.440
I mean, because he's just like a wild animal.

28:03.440 --> 28:07.280
He's like breaking locks so he can get into his friend's bed to bang.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.560
What did you do to your roommate in the past?

28:10.560 --> 28:11.520
Yeah.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.640
That has made him this single-minded revenge machine.

28:14.640 --> 28:15.040
You're right.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.080
There is a wrong somewhere that he is attempting to right.

28:18.080 --> 28:18.560
That's the only thing that makes sense.

28:18.560 --> 28:22.720
And you'll bust in on him and he'll be like, do you remember that time you ate the pizza

28:22.720 --> 28:23.360
Hot Pocket?

28:23.360 --> 28:24.320
That was my pizza Hot Pocket, David.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.320
That's some Genghis Khan shit, though.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.240
Like, if you fucked in this guy's bed and he was like, well, in payback,

28:30.240 --> 28:33.760
I'm going to fuck in your bed exclusively for the rest of my life.

28:35.440 --> 28:35.920
Hope you don't want to-

28:35.920 --> 28:37.760
Even if you move out, if you-

28:37.760 --> 28:40.160
Yeah, I hope you weren't planning on starting a family.

28:40.160 --> 28:40.800
Yeah.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.680
I- I-

28:41.680 --> 28:44.400
We don't normally do, like, follow up on questions.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.800
This is one where I really want you to talk to-

28:46.800 --> 28:49.280
Like, I have to know.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.320
You have to ask him, like, what is the attraction?

28:52.320 --> 28:54.560
Does he just not want to get crabs in his bed?

28:54.560 --> 28:57.200
Or he thinks I'm a lot of really, real duds?

28:57.200 --> 28:58.720
Like, what is the idea?

28:59.280 --> 29:00.240
I don't get it.

29:00.240 --> 29:00.880
I really don't.

29:00.880 --> 29:01.920
And I have to know.

29:01.920 --> 29:02.720
I'm captivated.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.840
You live a fascinating life, David.

29:05.840 --> 29:06.960
You live a fascinating life.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.200
You guys are in Yahoo?

29:09.200 --> 29:10.320
Absolutely.

29:12.640 --> 29:13.200
I've got a few.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.320
This Yahoo...

29:14.320 --> 29:15.040
Let's go with this one.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.040
This Yahoo was sent in by Elliot Harmon.

29:17.040 --> 29:17.680
Thank you, Elliot.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.160
I doubt it too, who asks,

29:25.360 --> 29:29.120
does wind have free will or does God direct every puff?

29:30.320 --> 29:33.200
Come on, somebody has to know or at least pretend to know.

29:33.200 --> 29:39.600
Somebody has to know or at least pretend to know that-

29:39.600 --> 29:41.200
The Yahoo Answers story.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.800
Yeah, right, exactly.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.560
I like any question that starts with, come on.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.040
Yeah.

29:47.040 --> 29:47.840
Come on, guys.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.000
Has this gone on long enough?

29:50.640 --> 29:56.560
Do you know how sometimes, like, you can't get a kite going?

29:57.280 --> 29:58.560
Oh, a kite?

29:58.560 --> 29:59.120
Yeah, kite.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.640
When you're finding a kite and you can't get it.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.440
All right, Jesus.

30:01.440 --> 30:05.360
Sometimes you're flying a kite and you can't get it going.

30:07.920 --> 30:08.640
Is that proof?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.680
Good grief.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.080
Yeah.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.520
And then Snoopy walks by.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.560
Maybe, is that proof that God is dead?

30:14.560 --> 30:15.600
Is that what that means?

30:16.560 --> 30:18.720
No, it's proof that God's napping.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.200
Okay.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.120
He's just taking a nap right now.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.520
Or it's proof that you've done something terrible in your life

30:23.520 --> 30:25.200
and God doesn't want your kite to fly.

30:25.200 --> 30:25.440
Yeah.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.640
Maybe if you lived a more pure life.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.440
The other question is, like, when a breeze comes along and, like,

30:31.440 --> 30:34.240
blows a girl's skirt up and everyone can see her underpants.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.840
Does that mean God's a pervo?

30:35.840 --> 30:36.080
Yeah.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.280
Maybe God's just giving us a little something, you know?

30:39.280 --> 30:39.920
For being good.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.600
I'm sorry, zapped?

30:41.600 --> 30:44.240
Is that something that happens to you in, like, your day-to-day?

30:44.240 --> 30:45.520
Pretty frequently?

30:45.520 --> 30:47.200
Every single day.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.280
It's even if the girl's wearing, like, pants.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.520
It blows her pants up.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.560
The wind blows the pants up.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.200
What the fuck?

30:54.640 --> 30:56.720
And then somebody comes along and sharks her.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.220
Yeah.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.600
That's true, no.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.600
And God directed that man to do that thing.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.400
Thanks.

31:03.400 --> 31:08.600
Once you start assigning things that have happened that God did,

31:08.600 --> 31:16.120
like, did God, this Yahoo Answers person has hit on something very primal.

31:16.680 --> 31:22.360
Did God make the derecho and knock out my power?

31:22.360 --> 31:22.920
Why?

31:22.920 --> 31:26.440
If God has control over it and he knows we need to record my bim bam,

31:26.440 --> 31:31.000
why would God use a derecho to knock out my power?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.640
And here's what I – so, in my Zen training,

31:34.600 --> 31:39.640
and this idea of, you know, that there is some guiding force in everything,

31:39.640 --> 31:43.000
it makes me think that if we had done My Brother, My Brother and Me last week,

31:43.000 --> 31:44.440
everyone would have died.

31:44.440 --> 31:44.680
Yeah.

31:45.560 --> 31:46.440
Oh, right?

31:46.440 --> 31:47.480
It was so funny?

31:48.600 --> 31:53.400
And people were like, oh, it's such a terrible thing that there was no episode this week.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.760
But what they didn't know –

31:54.760 --> 31:55.880
Right, there was a joke in it.

31:55.880 --> 31:59.560
There had been, if there had been, rampant death.

31:59.560 --> 32:04.920
Yeah, a joke is so – one of the jokes would be so funny that you would –

32:04.920 --> 32:09.880
Everybody would be driving, listening to it via their FM transmitters, and they would just die.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.720
And it – yeah, it would be like The Ring.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.960
Like, seven days after you hear this joke, you die.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.640
I don't think it has to be that widespread.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.720
Like, I think we – what's more likely is we'd say something mean about French Stewart,

32:21.720 --> 32:23.560
and then he'd hear the podcast and kill himself.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.040
Oh, that was the one he would listen.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.520
Yeah, we – I don't think I would send him that one.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.480
I like his work.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.360
I mean, like, I think he would enjoy the show.

32:33.000 --> 32:33.320
Yeah.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.120
But maybe not the one where we say mean things about him.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.440
Have you been sending him episodes?

32:38.440 --> 32:38.760
Oh, yeah.

32:38.760 --> 32:39.480
Every – yeah.

32:39.480 --> 32:44.840
Wait, that was – we told you to – you've been – you were on French Stewart duty, I think, Trav.

32:44.840 --> 32:45.560
Oh, God.

32:45.560 --> 32:48.280
Yeah, you were supposed to be reaching out to French.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.600
Oh, I thought you said to be Frenching out.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.640
And that's what I've been doing.

32:53.640 --> 32:53.800
No.

32:54.920 --> 33:03.320
I don't like our two options here, because the options are either God shoots a wind gun

33:03.320 --> 33:07.640
at the Earth in ways that please him, for the people who please him.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.760
That's a little – that's a little Greco-Roman for my tastes.

33:10.760 --> 33:15.480
Or the wind itself has free will, and it's like, God, there's a skirt!

33:15.480 --> 33:15.960
Get it!

33:18.120 --> 33:19.480
All wind is dirty perverts.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.320
Look at that stupid kid with that kite!

33:21.320 --> 33:22.840
Let's knock it down!

33:22.840 --> 33:24.840
Now, Griffin, I'm going to give you a third option.

33:24.840 --> 33:25.080
Okay.

33:25.880 --> 33:29.400
Wind does have free will, and God is constantly battling it.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.160
Oh, my God.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.280
That's how tornadoes happen, right?

33:35.240 --> 33:35.720
Right.

33:35.720 --> 33:39.160
It's when the wind just wants to blow a lady's skirt up so bad, and God's like,

33:39.160 --> 33:40.600
no, you dirty pervy wind!

33:40.600 --> 33:45.000
That's why all tornadoes move in the direction of ladies with skirts.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.120
All wind is a ghost of a dirty old man.

33:48.120 --> 33:48.520
Okay.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.400
So we know that.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.320
So it's always trying to either blow ladies' skirts up –

33:51.320 --> 33:52.680
Just like in The Giver.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.240
Yeah, just like in The Giver, just like in The Giving Tree,

33:55.240 --> 33:57.240
all wind is the ghost of a dirty old man.

33:57.240 --> 33:57.320
Right.

33:57.320 --> 34:00.360
So it can either blow skirts up – that's the one thing wind does –

34:00.360 --> 34:03.000
the other thing wind does is play with little kids with their –

34:03.000 --> 34:05.960
with whatever, like, wind toy that they have.

34:05.960 --> 34:09.800
And as we've already established, it watches people fuck, or tries to.

34:09.800 --> 34:10.360
Yeah, right.

34:10.360 --> 34:13.320
Whenever you – don't leave your blinds open, because you know what's out there?

34:13.320 --> 34:13.720
Wind.

34:13.720 --> 34:16.120
And it's watching you get it on in your roommate's bed.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.080
Yeah, wind is the – wind is the enemy.

34:19.080 --> 34:24.360
Now, God – God's like, I don't know why I thought it was a good idea to make this –

34:24.360 --> 34:25.480
Sentient wind.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.360
Sentient wind?

34:26.360 --> 34:27.320
What was I thinking?

34:27.320 --> 34:28.040
I was young.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.840
I was making – I was young and in love.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.080
I was – I was 40 trillion back then.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.440
I was only 40 trillion.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.000
I was making a lot of mistakes, a lot of crazy stuff.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.600
And I didn't mean to make sentient wind.

34:40.600 --> 34:41.560
That was my bad.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.040
But I'm infallible, so I can fix this.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.480
I meant to make sentient dirt.

34:45.480 --> 34:50.920
I meant to make sentient dirt, but it slipped.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.200
Sentient dirt would be the worst.

34:52.200 --> 34:53.080
Wouldn't it, though?

34:53.080 --> 34:56.520
As soon as it got a tree in it, it'd be like, look at me, everybody.

34:58.280 --> 34:59.720
I've got flowers.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.000
What do you want, fruit?

35:01.000 --> 35:01.880
I can make it.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.080
I've got so many nutrients.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.520
I got some gold in me, but I'm not going to tell you where.

35:10.520 --> 35:13.880
Hey, look over here.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.320
There's an arrowhead.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.160
It's a secret.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.240
It's my secret arrowhead.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.120
I'm never going to tell.

35:21.880 --> 35:22.520
Oil?

35:22.520 --> 35:24.280
There's some oil in here somewhere.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.440
You've got to fight for it, though.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.560
All the worms moving all up in me, too.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.480
That's a nice pocket of natural gas over here.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.520
Come on and get it.

35:35.640 --> 35:36.520
Stupid dirt.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.760
God, I'm glad you're not sentient dirt.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.080
Because that would be all dirt's day.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.600
And then if you start digging, forget about it.

35:46.920 --> 35:47.960
How could you do this?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.600
I would have just told you where the arrowhead was.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.120
And then, of course, golems.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.720
Got to fight with those.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.080
So that was all science.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.240
This has been our science podcast.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.080
We should seriously do a science-themed show.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.360
That would be the best.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.360
Let's do one whole episode on space.

36:10.920 --> 36:11.720
Here's my idea.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.000
Start sending in your science questions now.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.120
This is such a good idea.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.000
We go to COSI in Columbus.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.480
We go to COSI in Columbus.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.680
We do a kid-friendly science show.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.560
And we do it at COSI on the stage there.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.840
Would COSI approve of us saying that wind is ghosts?

36:33.160 --> 36:36.120
I feel like COSI has an exhibit called Wind is Not Ghosts.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.720
And we would be doing our show in front of that.

36:37.720 --> 36:38.840
And it would feel a little disingenuous.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.080
I feel like we would be watching people, like COSI employees,

36:41.080 --> 36:42.280
lining the back wall.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.960
And they'd start laughing.

36:43.960 --> 36:48.120
And then by the end, they'd just be restrained physically.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.720
Science is dead.

36:49.720 --> 36:50.920
None of this is true.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.040
You guys killed science.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.000
Don't listen to them.

36:53.880 --> 36:57.640
To me, doing our show in front of an audience of 30 kids

36:57.640 --> 36:59.800
would be like working without a net.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.800
I think it would be terrifying.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.600
All you got to do is slip one ghost fucking fuck.

37:04.600 --> 37:09.480
And you're like, oh no, my childhood is over.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.360
And you just see Mr. COSI go, shut it down.

37:12.360 --> 37:13.000
Shut it down.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.760
And three sniper rifle lasers just train on us.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.640
Put him in the time tunnel.

37:19.640 --> 37:24.360
COSI has an exhibit about checking your balls and boobs

37:24.360 --> 37:27.560
for cancer lumps, which you do by watching a video

37:27.560 --> 37:29.960
and feeling up prosthetic balls and boobs.

37:29.960 --> 37:33.320
I don't think we can get any raunchier than that.

37:33.320 --> 37:34.680
Yeah, that's true.

37:34.680 --> 37:35.240
COSI is already pretty raunchy.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.440
You should do those things.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.760
It's important to learn how to check your stuff.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.880
But then you have a thing there that you're like, yeah,

37:41.880 --> 37:43.400
feel up on these boobs, Griffin.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.600
You're on a church trip.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.080
Wait till the-

37:45.080 --> 37:47.000
Hey, nine-year-old Griffin, go to town.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.840
Wait till you're in your pastor's blind spot,

37:48.840 --> 37:50.120
and then go to town.

37:51.480 --> 37:52.920
I don't know if you guys know this,

37:52.920 --> 37:57.160
but COSI also has that thing with all the corpses now.

37:57.160 --> 37:57.400
What?

37:58.040 --> 37:59.560
They have the bodies?

37:59.560 --> 38:02.280
Yeah, it's coming in October.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.000
Oh my god.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.520
So that'll be pretty crazy.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.840
You can just feel up all the bodies.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.040
Yeah, just touch the butt.

38:08.040 --> 38:08.680
Oh god.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.560
Yeah, we gotta do this science show.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.800
You know, for kids.

38:13.800 --> 38:14.120
Yeah.

38:14.120 --> 38:14.840
Yeah.

38:14.840 --> 38:18.120
Well, that would get in the way of our longstanding policy

38:18.120 --> 38:19.720
of being drunk while doing this.

38:20.360 --> 38:20.760
Yeah.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.760
We could be drunk on science.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.840
I think any kind of drunk is drunk on science.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.360
Can we do a tape delay?

38:28.360 --> 38:28.760
Yeah.

38:28.760 --> 38:30.360
Is that possible with a room full of children?

38:30.360 --> 38:34.280
If we're speaking like really, really far away from them,

38:34.280 --> 38:36.520
then the speed of sound will give us about a second.

38:36.520 --> 38:38.680
And we can figure out what the speed of sound is,

38:38.680 --> 38:40.920
because we'll be at COSI, so we'll just do some research.

38:40.920 --> 38:44.680
You know, the speed of sound is as fast as it fucking wants to be.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.080
That's not actually true.

38:47.080 --> 38:47.240
Yeah.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.920
It's as fast as you can throw a microphone.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.280
You know the fastest way to my heart?

38:52.280 --> 38:52.680
What's that?

38:52.680 --> 39:02.920
Money.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.760
Griffin, who is this message for?

39:04.760 --> 39:06.920
This message is for Luke Jordan.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.960
It is from Abby, Matt, Sam, Ashley, and Tucker.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.080
They would like to wish their brother Luke Jordan

39:13.080 --> 39:15.080
the happiest of 29th birthdays,

39:15.080 --> 39:18.120
and thank him for introducing all of his siblings to my bim-bam.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.400
Thank you so much for watching.

39:19.400 --> 39:23.320
Luke enjoys rock climbing and snowboarding, but most of all, being an evangelist for the Chuckles,

39:23.320 --> 39:24.520
for the brothers three.

39:24.520 --> 39:28.760
Here's to getting him, here's to him getting it done in 20 does.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.040
Squatly pride.

39:30.040 --> 39:32.200
Can we examine what that means?

39:32.200 --> 39:34.280
I don't know what squatly pride means.

39:34.280 --> 39:39.400
And I do, I have to confess that knowing that people listen to our show

39:39.400 --> 39:41.560
that are that active physically.

39:41.560 --> 39:41.960
Yeah.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.800
Like, what are they trying to prove?

39:43.800 --> 39:46.200
Is it a situation where they're like,

39:46.200 --> 39:50.440
like what are they trying to prove? Is it a situation where they're trying to prove something?

39:50.440 --> 39:55.000
Or is it a case where the fact that they are doing it and we are inspiring them to do it?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.920
It's actually Luke and I have an accord.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.880
He is my surrogate exerciser.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.240
So he is getting fit.

40:01.240 --> 40:08.440
He's getting fit for me and that I'm living vicariously through his sweet abs and delts.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.520
And you're just filled with squatly pride.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.040
I'm filled with squatly pride.

40:12.040 --> 40:18.600
I'm filled with squatly pride for Desiree Gonzalez from her friends, from her friend, Julie Hill.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.600
Not to say that she only has the one friend.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.880
Not that she has, she probably has more than one friend besides Julie.

40:23.880 --> 40:28.760
But Julie is clearly her best friend because she's wishing a happy 30th birthday to her best friend Desiree.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.200
They both love poop and bam.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.040
And I love her so much.

40:32.040 --> 40:33.720
And then at the end it says, yay.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.640
You don't love her as much as I love you.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.920
All right, listen, Julie, you don't, you don't know Desiree like we do.

40:39.720 --> 40:40.680
You back off.

40:40.680 --> 40:41.640
You back off.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.360
You're done here.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.400
She might be your best friend, but we are her best friends.

40:45.400 --> 40:45.880
Right.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.160
We're her best friends that are brothers.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.600
Best brother friends.

40:48.600 --> 40:49.960
Happy Dirty 30.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.400
Happy Dirty 30.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.080
Megan Garland Tyler, I have a message for you.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.640
I just ran into the room.

40:57.640 --> 40:58.680
I'm out of breath.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.680
I've brought a message.

41:00.680 --> 41:01.960
Extra, extra.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.720
Read all about it.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.640
I've got a message from Steven Tyler here.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.120
He says, happy 32nd birthday to my amazing wife.

41:08.120 --> 41:12.120
She and I are both huge fans of your podcast, and she'll be extremely excited about the mention.

41:12.120 --> 41:14.120
Especially if she can make it into a song.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.080
Here's a song.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.680
We don't do songs for people.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.280
Terrence and Philip.

41:20.280 --> 41:20.600
I want you to know that.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.960
You should be our business.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.480
So happy 32nd birthday.

41:25.480 --> 41:25.880
You know what?

41:25.880 --> 41:30.600
I was going to make an Aerosmith joke, but Steven, you've done such a nice thing here

41:30.600 --> 41:34.600
that I'm sure that you get this joke all the time, and I'm not going to do it.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.600
And that's my birthday present to you.

41:36.600 --> 41:37.160
Nah, fuck it.

41:37.160 --> 41:41.880
That's why I want every single Mabim Bama listening, every Mabim Bambina listening,

41:41.880 --> 41:47.160
when you eventually meet the Aerosmith Steven Tyler, ask him if he's named after that awesome

41:47.160 --> 41:49.720
dude who bought the mention on my brother, my brother, and me.

41:50.920 --> 41:52.040
And then run away.

41:52.040 --> 41:55.720
And run away before he unhinges his scary mouth and eats you whole.

41:57.080 --> 42:00.760
Like a snake gobbling a mongoose.

Justin, is our sex toys really the best gift for-

42:15.960 --> 42:17.960
Don't finish the sentence because the answer is yes.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.520
I was going to say quinceañera.

42:20.520 --> 42:20.920
Still?

42:21.720 --> 42:22.220
Still?

42:22.760 --> 42:24.040
Yes, absolutely.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.240
Listen, she's a woman.

42:27.240 --> 42:27.480
Okay.

42:27.480 --> 42:32.200
Okay, for a quinceañera, a sweet 16, or a disappointing 17.

42:33.160 --> 42:36.280

uh, using the coupon code MIDDLEST, right?

43:07.560 --> 43:08.060
Yes.

43:08.060 --> 43:11.000
Using the coupon code MIDDLEST, you can save how much?

If you use the coupon code MIDDLEST, M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T, you get 20% off of your purchase.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.680
Which is, that's so much off.

43:20.680 --> 43:21.080
Yeah.

43:21.080 --> 43:21.960
That's a crazy amount.

43:21.960 --> 43:23.640
From the week of this broadcast.

43:23.640 --> 43:23.880
Yeah.

43:23.880 --> 43:28.200
And then every week after this, if you use it, you get 10% off.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.040
So it's an amazing deal.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.800
Um, but they sent us a list with no names, very discreet.

43:33.800 --> 43:37.000
Uh, they sent us a list of things that people have bought using the coupon code,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.320
and it's awesome.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.480
Things like the One Shot Inima Launcher.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.840
Things like the Super Snake Bite Suckers.

43:44.840 --> 43:49.400
Things like the Blossom Glass Dildo T.M. from the TV show Blossom.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.880
The Ostrich Tickler, which isn't what I think it is.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.120
Uh, they have everything for animals, too.

43:58.120 --> 44:02.840
The Japanese Nipple Clamps, which I think you can use even if you're not a black Japanese.

44:02.840 --> 44:08.200
There's also, uh, it's, if there's, there's, there's one reason that you should absolutely

44:08.200 --> 44:12.360
go to their website, go to the sections for dildos and insertables, and you'll see that

44:12.360 --> 44:18.840
in the, uh, picture for the inflatable dildo section, there is inexplicably a can of Coca

44:18.840 --> 44:20.440
Cola next to it.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.920
Uh, so go there and try to figure out why that is.

44:22.920 --> 44:25.160
Don't try to do it with a regular can of Coca Cola.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.200
Can't stress this enough.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.200
No, don't use this.

44:28.200 --> 44:31.240
They are not made of load-bearing materials, that's all I'm going to say.

44:31.240 --> 44:35.400
Um, but yeah, they have, they have a wide selection of things for, uh, you know, varying

44:35.400 --> 44:36.360
levels of kink.

44:36.360 --> 44:38.600
So, so go check it out, Extreme Restraints.

44:38.600 --> 44:42.600
If you have used, if you've used the Cubone Code mid-list and you've bought some of these

44:42.600 --> 44:47.560
products and you've used them and you've enjoyed them, go back and, uh, go to their website

44:47.560 --> 44:51.080
and write some product reviews and say, you know, tell them my brother, my brother and

44:51.080 --> 44:51.880
me sent you.

44:51.880 --> 44:56.120
Put it in the product reviews, talk about all the great, uh, experiences that you've

44:56.120 --> 44:59.000
had with them and how much you've enjoyed the products.

44:59.000 --> 44:59.720
They appreciate it.

44:59.720 --> 45:00.520
We appreciate it.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.320
Can I say my new favorite thing on this list?

45:03.320 --> 45:04.600
I've just read the entire thing.

45:04.600 --> 45:09.240
I mean, everything is so exotic with things like the Dougie Style Enhancement Strap or

45:09.240 --> 45:11.400
the Trinity Silicone Vibrating Butt Plug.

45:11.400 --> 45:14.440
What I like is that there's a thing on here just called the Probe.

45:16.840 --> 45:18.360
It sounds like serious business.

45:18.360 --> 45:22.600
ExtremeRestraints.com, Cubone Code mid-list.

45:22.600 --> 45:23.000
Get it.

45:23.960 --> 45:25.000
I got a question.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.680
In a couple of months, my older brother and his wife are going to move in.

45:29.240 --> 45:32.760
It's great that I'll get to hang out with my brother more, but there's a small problem.

45:32.760 --> 45:39.400
I love beer, but my brother is straight edge, meaning no drugs, alcohol or other stimulant.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.320
I know he will constantly judge me for drinking.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.840
I'm responsible when I drink.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.520
Not that I ever go beyond buzzed.

45:44.520 --> 45:45.640
Who gets drunk off beer?

45:47.880 --> 45:48.680
Lots of people.

45:49.640 --> 45:50.040
Everyone?

45:51.640 --> 45:53.240
But I know that won't matter to him.

45:53.240 --> 45:57.720
Is there any way I can get my brother to get off my back and stop being so judgmentalist

45:57.720 --> 45:59.640
from beer fan in Florida?

45:59.640 --> 46:02.600
Uh-uh. I think every time he judges you, you just say,

46:02.600 --> 46:04.440
oh, and how do you like living in my home?

46:05.160 --> 46:05.480
Yeah.

46:05.480 --> 46:06.040
Right.

46:06.040 --> 46:09.400
Yeah, how would you like it if you just lives elsewhere, sir?

46:10.680 --> 46:11.560
You wouldn't like it?

46:11.560 --> 46:12.600
Well, then chill out.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.200
Let me kick back this brew.

46:15.080 --> 46:18.840
Is this a former party monster scenario?

46:18.840 --> 46:22.760
He used to be, they called him the Ogre in college.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.640
And that the Ogre could pound so many?

46:27.640 --> 46:27.800
Yeah.

46:27.800 --> 46:30.280
Like no village was safe.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.640
They called him Chow-Rat.

46:31.640 --> 46:35.880
He would drink out of like a trophy and beat up nerds.

46:35.880 --> 46:36.120
Yeah.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.080
I can't go back to being the Ogre.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.600
I can't be Shrek anymore.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.440
I had hair on my palms.

46:42.440 --> 46:42.840
Help me.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.160
I had a pet donkey and everything.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.600
It was ridiculous.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.200
I don't think it was actually Shrek, Travis.

46:48.200 --> 46:49.400
Oh, I want him to be.

46:49.400 --> 46:51.080
I lived in a swamp.

46:51.080 --> 46:53.160
I fought a tiny John Lithgow.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.440
I am a fairy tale.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.760
I had bugles on my ears.

46:56.760 --> 47:01.000
I was in a movie by DreamWorks.

47:01.000 --> 47:01.880
Hi, I'm Mike Myers.

47:01.880 --> 47:02.520
Good one.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.720
Good zinger, Travis.

47:03.720 --> 47:04.360
Thank you.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.200
Why do you really keep the bit momentum going?

47:07.240 --> 47:08.360
You're the gingerbread man.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.160
Are you the Ogre?

47:11.720 --> 47:11.960
Me?

47:12.680 --> 47:12.920
Yes.

47:14.840 --> 47:15.800
I'm a commie Ogre.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.160
I take bits and I crush them.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.560
Crush them like somebody paps blue ribbon cans against your forehead.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.520
I think that it, okay, if it's a party monster situation,

47:26.520 --> 47:29.560
I don't know, if it's a situation where he just happens to be,

47:31.880 --> 47:36.200
like happens to be not an intaker of those things,

47:36.200 --> 47:41.080
I think that's something that actually will get better after exposure.

47:41.080 --> 47:44.840
Like the three of us grew up in a house where neither of our parents drank.

47:44.840 --> 47:48.680
Our mom might have the occasional glass of wine on a very rare occasion.

47:48.680 --> 47:49.880
Not that I think I ever-

47:49.880 --> 47:51.000
I never saw it.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.360
I saw it once.

47:52.360 --> 47:54.440
And it was when I was 21 and I looked at her and he said,

47:54.440 --> 47:57.640
I'm going to order a beer and she said, then I'm going to order a glass of wine.

47:57.640 --> 47:58.840
And I said, very well, mother.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.920
So that was a, it was a huge rarity at our house.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.360
And I think there's still some lingering,

48:04.360 --> 48:10.600
like when you, when I see someone drink for a long time,

48:10.600 --> 48:12.920
like especially like in college and stuff,

48:13.480 --> 48:17.960
I had associated people who drank with, with bad people,

48:17.960 --> 48:21.080
like with, with, with like not bad, like evil,

48:21.080 --> 48:24.680
but like it was something you're not supposed to do.

48:24.680 --> 48:27.640
And, and that was mainly just because I'd never seen my parents do it.

48:27.640 --> 48:31.800
So I think if he's living in your house and seeing like you are drinking

48:31.800 --> 48:35.800
and it, and it, it is not something that like impairs your life or anything,

48:35.800 --> 48:39.720
then, then I think he'll sort of get used to the idea.

48:39.720 --> 48:44.120
I think some of you who don't have never drank or, or what have you

48:44.120 --> 48:47.160
are under this impression that like you have one drink

48:47.160 --> 48:49.880
and all of a sudden you're a different person that they can't relate to.

48:49.880 --> 48:53.560
There's a lot of nuances question because if, if it's a situation where like

48:55.000 --> 48:57.560
he's a recovering alcoholic or he's in an A,

48:57.560 --> 49:00.600
like maybe it is a little insensitive to, I mean,

49:00.600 --> 49:03.000
it's still your house and you should be able to do what you want to do.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.960
But, but if he's, if he's recovering from something.

49:05.960 --> 49:10.040
Oh, but even that, I know a lot of recovering alcoholics that are like,

49:10.040 --> 49:11.560
no, fuck it. It doesn't bother me.

49:11.560 --> 49:16.200
Like enforcing, enforcing their lifestyle on you.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.960
That is not the case for everyone though.

49:17.960 --> 49:20.440
And if you, you're, this is your brother you're talking about.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.000
Like if it was me and one of you guys was in that situation,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.520
I probably just wouldn't drink because I wouldn't want to,

49:27.240 --> 49:28.760
I don't know. I just wouldn't want to put you guys.

49:28.760 --> 49:31.880
But I have to ask like how much of the judgment do you think is like perceived?

49:32.440 --> 49:35.960
Like how, is your brother actually going like, you shouldn't drink. It's bad.

49:36.600 --> 49:38.680
Yeah. Maybe when you drink, you get paranoid.

49:38.680 --> 49:39.000
Yeah.

49:39.880 --> 49:43.000
But maybe this guy like walks up to him every time you crack a beer

49:43.000 --> 49:44.520
and slaps out of your hand. It just feels.

49:44.520 --> 49:47.480
No, no beer in my house.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.040
Yeah. Wait a minute.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.480
In your house. No beers.

49:49.480 --> 49:50.040
Your house.

49:50.760 --> 49:52.040
Enjoy this, this Topo Chico.

49:52.040 --> 49:54.440
As long as you live under your roof.

49:54.440 --> 49:54.680
Yeah.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.480
That's quite literally a buzzkill, isn't it?

49:57.480 --> 50:00.120
Like, why do you want to be around your straight edge brother

50:00.120 --> 50:01.640
when you're trying to hoist a few?

50:01.640 --> 50:03.960
Why don't you go out to a little watering hole?

50:03.960 --> 50:05.400
Trying to just hoist a few.

50:06.200 --> 50:06.760
For once.

50:09.400 --> 50:13.080
I don't, I don't know. I wish I knew more about the situation.

50:13.080 --> 50:16.600
I think tentatively, you should just secret drink in the bathroom.

50:16.600 --> 50:19.240
No, maybe you get him drunk.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.840
No, wait a minute.

50:20.840 --> 50:24.680
I understand like spike some stuff and then be like, who's judgmental now, Steve?

50:25.720 --> 50:26.760
I roofed you.

50:26.760 --> 50:28.280
That's awful.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.280
Who's in charge now, Steven?

50:31.240 --> 50:39.160
I, I don't, here's what this, this guy's question does not give me any indication

50:39.160 --> 50:44.360
that like, he says he will constantly judge him, but like, what is he doing with his life?

50:44.360 --> 50:45.080
That's so great.

50:45.080 --> 50:49.560
Well, the background, the background is they're moving into his house because he got really drunk and set their house on fire.

50:49.560 --> 50:55.160
One of you drinks and one of you doesn't, and one of you is homeless.

50:55.160 --> 51:00.840
So maybe, maybe it's time for your brother to get off his fucking high horse and kick back a few of these.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.560
Drink a few pebers and just relax.

51:03.560 --> 51:07.720
Are you saying that pebers are the secret to universal security?

51:07.720 --> 51:10.360
The secret to universal success.

51:10.360 --> 51:14.120
No, but I'm saying the president drinks PBR and he's the president.

51:14.120 --> 51:22.280
If you're homeless and you're, maybe it's a good time to start drinking because you need to forget about that fact that you don't have a house anymore.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.000
Yeah.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.120
Like move it.

51:24.120 --> 51:24.600
Yeah.

51:26.600 --> 51:27.880
I don't understand.

51:27.880 --> 51:30.040
If you, if you don't want to drink, I get it.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.360
I don't, but I get it, I guess.

51:32.360 --> 51:38.360
To chastise people who decide to, I mean, but that's very easy for me to say, right?

51:38.360 --> 51:44.280
Like if you were, if one of you guys started doing blow, like I would probably get a little judgey about that.

51:44.280 --> 51:51.080
If we were problem drinkers, if we were, if we drank to feel and shit, like then it would be a problem.

51:51.080 --> 51:55.800
But this guy sounds like he's responsible because he says it and that's really all I have to go on.

51:55.800 --> 51:57.400
Maybe he's not.

51:57.400 --> 51:58.600
Maybe, uh oh.

51:58.600 --> 51:59.160
Oops.

51:59.160 --> 52:05.240
Yeah, the sentence of who gets drunk on beer is kind of, kind of scary to me.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.800
I drink like 30 or 40 of them and I'm fine.

52:07.800 --> 52:08.760
I can't be drunk.

52:08.760 --> 52:09.960
I've been having beer.

52:11.240 --> 52:13.160
It's mostly water anyways.

52:13.160 --> 52:14.200
It's mostly water.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.640
I'm just sleepy.

52:16.680 --> 52:20.440
I'm tired and I didn't want to wear clothes.

52:20.440 --> 52:21.560
I got hot.

52:21.560 --> 52:23.000
I took my pants off.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.520
It has nothing to do with me.

52:24.520 --> 52:27.880
I just need some sprees and then I'll be good to go.

52:27.880 --> 52:30.200
I must have just gotten food poisoning.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.640
That's the only thing that makes sense.

52:31.640 --> 52:33.080
These beers are rotten.

52:34.200 --> 52:36.280
I wanted to sleep in a swimming pool.

52:36.280 --> 52:37.240
It's like camping.

52:39.400 --> 52:40.200
Let's move on.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.560
Guys, this Friday and every Friday at 10 PM on IFC, you got a tune for comedy bang bang.

52:45.560 --> 52:49.960
It's an absurd half hour comedy show that only looks like a talk show.

52:49.960 --> 52:53.400
They got a host Scott Ackerman band led by Reggie Watts.

52:53.400 --> 52:57.000
They got great guests Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, and Seth Rogen.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.240
I don't know why I said Galifianakis like that, but I did.

53:00.120 --> 53:03.800
And this Friday they got Paul Rudd and there's going to be a robot inventor

53:04.360 --> 53:07.240
and Todd Barry will be there and also Chris Parnell.

53:07.240 --> 53:11.400
So tune in this Friday at 10 PM on IFC for comedy bang bang.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.720
Comedy so nice, they banged it twice.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.600
Can you give me a Yahoo, please?

53:17.800 --> 53:18.040
Yes.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.720
It was sent in by Trevor.

53:22.360 --> 53:23.080
Oh no, I'm sorry.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.600
It was sent in by Lisa Holowfield.

53:24.600 --> 53:25.720
It was asked by Trevor.

53:25.720 --> 53:26.360
Thank you to both.

53:26.360 --> 53:26.860
Trevor.

53:28.200 --> 53:32.120
Trevor asks, is it illegal to make a movie about a cat?

53:36.920 --> 53:39.480
I would like to make a movie about a cat named Trevor,

53:39.480 --> 53:43.240
but I'm afraid to do it and a lady across the street from me is a lawyer

53:43.240 --> 53:45.960
and I'm worried to do it once my sister made a movie,

53:45.960 --> 53:47.720
but I'm not sure if I could do it or not.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.320
I really do not know what to do.

53:50.840 --> 53:56.040
Okay, wait, is the question asker named Trevor or is the cat named Trevor?

53:56.040 --> 53:57.160
It's a bio pic.

53:57.160 --> 53:58.600
It's a bio pic about a cat.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.520
It's like that movie Fluke, pretty much.

54:00.520 --> 54:02.680
Is this a cat using Yahoo answers?

54:02.680 --> 54:04.200
That's my first question.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.560
So I, this is a child.

54:07.560 --> 54:08.680
It has to be a child.

54:08.680 --> 54:09.400
It has to be a child.

54:09.400 --> 54:14.360
And this child, there's a lawyer, a lawyer, spelled with an O,

54:15.880 --> 54:16.600
who lives across the street.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.120
Lawyer the barbarian.

54:18.120 --> 54:21.240
He knows that lawyer the barbarian lives across the street

54:21.240 --> 54:26.600
and in his mind, the way that their whole litigious operation breaks down

54:26.600 --> 54:28.920
is they kick in the door and say, no, no, no.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.600
I'll put you in jail for doing it.

54:30.600 --> 54:34.200
Lawyer is just looking out through the blinds at him filming this cat.

54:35.240 --> 54:37.560
It sounds like his parents have told him like,

54:38.600 --> 54:41.560
you know, don't write on the walls or else the lawyer,

54:41.560 --> 54:44.200
the barbarian will come down and eat you whole.

54:45.800 --> 54:49.160
Additional details in the film, I will be killing the cat.

54:49.160 --> 54:51.800
Now that is a crime.

54:52.920 --> 54:55.080
Are there any additional details and or answers?

54:55.800 --> 54:57.640
No, it's not illegal to make a movie about a cat.

54:57.640 --> 55:00.600
It's only illegal if you hurt the cat, let the creative notions flow.

55:01.880 --> 55:05.000
No, what is the creative notion about a cat?

55:05.000 --> 55:08.360
Like it, like I saw Milo and Otis.

55:08.360 --> 55:11.320
I know it could be charming with a lot of post-production,

55:11.320 --> 55:16.040
but at the level of a six year old, I'm assuming six is going to be filming.

55:16.040 --> 55:17.720
It's basically just going to be a lot of like,

55:17.720 --> 55:21.320
like I'm a cat, I'm a cat.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.520
My name is Trevor.

55:23.480 --> 55:25.640
This is a story of Trevor the cat

55:25.640 --> 55:29.000
and how his parents didn't really love him after the new baby came.

55:32.440 --> 55:35.080
He started packing his bag to run away

55:35.080 --> 55:38.680
because he hated his new baby brother, Skyler.

55:38.680 --> 55:43.240
Hey, but then with the economy being what it was, Trevor was very sad.

55:44.200 --> 55:47.560
Bad news guys, I kind of want to see this movie now.

55:47.560 --> 55:50.520
I hope it doesn't get caught up in a lot of legal red tape.

55:50.520 --> 55:53.720
Did you guys hear about Peter Hewitt,

55:53.720 --> 55:56.680
the director of Garfield the movie is doing 25 to life.

55:57.400 --> 55:57.960
Did you know?

55:58.600 --> 55:58.840
What?

56:00.760 --> 56:01.640
Sorry, is that true?

56:01.640 --> 56:02.120
Yeah.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.560
Oh yeah, right.

56:03.560 --> 56:03.880
Okay.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.240
For cat-based crimes.

56:05.240 --> 56:05.720
Idiot.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
You stupid asshole.

56:07.720 --> 56:09.720
That was going to be the goof of the century.

56:11.480 --> 56:14.920
Did you know that that studio that produced Garfield the movie

56:14.920 --> 56:17.880
was called Davis Entertainment and also Paws, Inc.

56:19.160 --> 56:20.120
Now is that true?

56:20.120 --> 56:21.240
That is a hundo true.

56:23.160 --> 56:27.560
Maybe this kid is talking about like the lawyer, the barbarian

56:27.560 --> 56:30.840
and their role in like settling distribution rights.

56:30.840 --> 56:36.840
Yeah, or maybe the movie he wants to create is Garfield the movie three.

56:37.480 --> 56:38.840
Three fast, three furious.

56:42.040 --> 56:44.040
Garfield three kitten play.

56:44.040 --> 56:48.280
And that would probably get him in a touch of hot water.

56:48.280 --> 56:52.200
What if he's making a propaganda film starring a cat named Trevor?

56:53.400 --> 56:55.240
What if it's a sequel to a pot?

56:55.240 --> 56:57.640
Maybe it's like girl in the dragon,

56:57.640 --> 57:00.600
girl with the dragon tattoo and it's the number two.

57:00.600 --> 57:02.280
And it's a movie starring his cat.

57:02.280 --> 57:03.560
Because that's going to get you in this.

57:03.560 --> 57:06.520
He's making Ghostbusters three starring his cat.

57:07.560 --> 57:08.600
That's a problem.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.440
If he uses, you can't get what he uses.

57:10.440 --> 57:14.200
Like if the whole soundtrack for his kitten movie

57:14.200 --> 57:19.320
was by Dashboard Confessional that he like ripped off of a CD, that's an issue.

57:19.320 --> 57:22.360
This is my movie Cat to the Future starring Trevor.

57:23.000 --> 57:23.960
Trevor the cat.

57:23.960 --> 57:28.360
And all of the Huey Lewis music I could find, which is three songs.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.360
And the smart bartender from Dawson's Creek.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.840
I got him really cheap actually.

57:32.840 --> 57:35.800
Surprisingly enough, his schedule was like wide open.

57:35.800 --> 57:36.600
It wasn't even a big deal.

57:36.600 --> 57:40.280
If his cat's name is Pepsi, this is an issue.

57:40.280 --> 57:41.800
You're going to run into problems.

57:41.800 --> 57:41.960
Yeah.

57:44.040 --> 57:48.600
This is my movie A Day in the Life of Trevor, music by the Beatles.

57:53.240 --> 57:56.120
This has been our comedy show, my brother, my brother, and me.

57:56.120 --> 57:58.760
We hope you've enjoyed it and had fun listening to it.

57:58.760 --> 58:03.240
If you have, could you maybe go do a review on iTunes?

58:03.240 --> 58:06.120
Or maybe a subscription on iTunes?

58:06.120 --> 58:07.880
That helps to spread the word about the show.

58:08.680 --> 58:11.640
And also tweet about it with the MBMBAM hashtag.

58:11.640 --> 58:18.200
You can be just like, buzz click, cool teen Naruto, jerk face killer, Andrea L Hill,

58:21.080 --> 58:29.880
Dirdlin, the Meowthram, Krista Whalen, Smeat, Notencolor, Landon K, Lord Wolfington,

58:29.880 --> 58:30.920
and so many others.

58:30.920 --> 58:34.120
Thank you guys for tweeting about the show and hanging in there with us

58:34.120 --> 58:36.840
when we missed a week.

58:36.840 --> 58:37.960
I had an idea.

58:37.960 --> 58:44.360
I had a brilliant sort of pay it forward-esque epiphany for a way that people could spread

58:44.360 --> 58:45.320
the word about the show.

58:45.320 --> 58:50.840
Is you take a jump drive and you put your favorite episodes on it and you give it to

58:50.840 --> 58:54.680
somebody, maybe a stranger, maybe a friend, and you tell them to copy and paste the episodes

58:54.680 --> 58:57.960
off the jump drive onto their computer and then they hand it off to somebody else.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.280
Oh, I love this.

59:00.280 --> 59:00.840
Isn't that nice?

59:00.840 --> 59:02.760
And maybe you could even write pay it forward on there.

59:02.760 --> 59:05.400
And then people will think that the jump drive has pay it forward on it.

59:05.400 --> 59:06.360
And like, oh, I love that movie.

59:06.360 --> 59:07.560
I haven't seen it in a grip.

59:07.560 --> 59:10.040
And then they plug it in and like, well, I don't know what this is, but I'll watch it

59:10.040 --> 59:10.520
anyway.

59:10.520 --> 59:12.440
And then they figure it out and hand it off.

59:13.320 --> 59:13.800
Yeah.

59:13.800 --> 59:17.320
And you write MBMBAM on one side and the other side, pay it forward.

59:18.040 --> 59:19.400
And then you just keep passing it around.

59:19.400 --> 59:20.440
I love this idea.

59:20.440 --> 59:21.160
So there's an idea.

59:21.160 --> 59:22.280
Just something to get started.

59:24.040 --> 59:27.880
We talked about doing like branding on CDs, but that's, I mean, that's environmentally

59:27.880 --> 59:28.440
unfriendly.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.400
That's so 2000.

59:29.400 --> 59:29.720
Yeah.

59:29.720 --> 59:30.120
Yeah.

59:30.120 --> 59:33.640
Do that, make that jump drive, then take a picture of it and send it to us on Twitter

59:34.200 --> 59:35.800
and we'll retweet you.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.240
And then we'll, so you can, we'll pin it.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.480
So just to be, pin it to Pinterest.

59:40.440 --> 59:43.720
I want to think, I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme

59:43.720 --> 59:43.960
song.

59:43.960 --> 59:48.280
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed, which is a really good album.

59:48.280 --> 59:52.040
Real, real nice tunes, nice strings and strums and drums.

59:53.400 --> 59:58.120
And I want to tell you guys about an epic opportunity for you, our listeners.

59:58.120 --> 59:58.840
Okay.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.240
So maybe you've never made it to a live show before.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.440
We haven't done that many.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.120
And we have some posters that are only available at live shows, right?

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.760
So maybe you want one of those posters and you want one that's signed by not only the

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.840
three McElroy brothers, but also the artist, Justin Russo and Sydney McElroy.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.040
It's pretty exclusive.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.240
Well, here's your opportunity.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.040
You can get one and benefit Wesley Johnson.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.320
He's having to have some surgery done and he's trying to pay for it.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.960
And you can buy the poster and help him to pay for the surgery.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.200
Just go to bit.ly slash help.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.760
We Joe W E J O.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.960
And you can bid on the poster and possibly win it.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.240
And then you have your own piece of my brother, my brother, me memorabilia.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.000
And you've helped out an awesome guy.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.040
So check it out.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.280
You've kept a mountain of a man alive.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.400
So yeah.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.200
So lend a hand if you so lend a hand if you can.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.800
And thank you so much for listening.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.720
Be sure to tune in next Monday.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.240
We'll return with a new episode.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.800
But until then, thank you for being you.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.200
We love you.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.160
We love you very much.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.080
Oh, and give right now give a listen to the other Max Fun shows.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.120
If you haven't throwing shade.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:00.280
Yeah.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.040
Jordan, Jesse, go judge on Hodgeman.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.400
Stop podcasting yourself.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.360
Bullseye Jesse.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.760
Jesse hinted on his Twitter that they're going to be announcing a new show on the Max Fun

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.240
lineup.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.760
I don't know what it is yet.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:11.720
What the fuck?

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.040
Yeah.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:12.600
But yeah.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:13.640
Yeah.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:18.840
Like we just got used to throwing shade and having to share the love of our pod father.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.040
And now better not having to do better not having brothers on it.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.880
No advice.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.800
If you give advice, I'm going to burn it down.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.240
And this final Yahoo was sent in by Earl Parsons.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.200
Thank you, Earl.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sky who asks.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.000
If I die, is there Yahoo Answers in heaven?

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.040
Oh, shit.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:40.680
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.880
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.600
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.400
Kiss your dad.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.600
Square on the lips.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.040
Keep your heart three stacks.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.080
Keep your heart.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.240
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.200
Keep your heart.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.560
Man, these girls are smart.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.200
Three stacks.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.320
These girls are smart.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:25.880
Play your part, play your part.
