00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:46.720
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother,

00:46.720 --> 00:51.680
and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.680 --> 00:55.680
I'm your middle-est brother, and they call me Travis McElroy.

00:55.680 --> 01:00.240
Well, my name's Griffin, and I'm here to say I forgot how to podcast in a major way.

01:00.240 --> 01:07.280
Uh, welcome to My Three Dads, a new podcast for dads, about dads.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.840
Okay, let me pitch an alternate title, alternate title.

01:11.040 --> 01:11.680
Dadvice.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.240
Dadvice, that's not bad at all.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.600
No, it's actually, it's not-

01:15.600 --> 01:16.320
Very bad.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.040
No, it's Dadvice, it's like Advice, but then I said it out loud,

01:19.040 --> 01:20.720
it makes it sound like Miami Vice, but with Dad.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.720
Well, yeah, it sounds like we're talking about vices for dads, which is just like,

01:24.720 --> 01:30.000
you know, good Coke, Coke for me, thanks, I don't sleep anymore, so that's my Dadvice.

01:31.040 --> 01:35.520
I think we should talk about, I mean, like, today's first topic is just about sleeping,

01:35.520 --> 01:38.000
so I want to talk about how everybody slept last night.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.640
I'll start, uh, I was at the Cincinnatian Hotel, and I slept on a, on a, I, I,

01:44.640 --> 01:48.800
we ordered room service, some bread pudding and various ice creams,

01:48.800 --> 01:56.080
and then I laid upon a feather bed, uh, with my wife and child, and slept 11 hours from, uh,

01:56.080 --> 02:00.640
in an uninterrupted block from 10 p.m. to 9 a.m.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.440
Hi, you're just coasting on that pud.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.840
I think that's an experience you guys can both relate to, just sleeping 11 hours.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.720
Uh, I was curious how you guys slept last night.

02:10.720 --> 02:15.200
Well, Justin, I'll tell you, last night I slept for nine uninterrupted hours,

02:15.200 --> 02:21.600
because my wife is a goddamn saint, and we have been, we have been trading off every other night,

02:21.600 --> 02:25.440
so actually, night before last, I slept for a total of two hours.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.800
Last night I slept for nine hours, three nights ago, nine hours.

02:28.800 --> 02:34.480
I've had this real rollercoaster sleep schedule that is fucking up my body.

02:34.480 --> 02:39.360
I went to bed at 10, and at 11 I got a text from my baby that was like, you up?

02:39.360 --> 02:48.640
Yo, fourth meal, yo, dads, dads, fourth meal.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.160
It happened again, it happened again, right in my shorts.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.240
Hey, big, hey, big update, you up?

02:54.240 --> 02:55.360
I got legs.

02:55.360 --> 02:55.600
What?

02:58.320 --> 02:59.840
Yeah, it's crazy.

02:59.840 --> 03:05.920
That is 90% of the sounds my baby makes is like, whoa, or some equivalent of that, like,

03:05.920 --> 03:06.880
have you seen this?

03:06.880 --> 03:08.320
I think it's called a hand.

03:08.320 --> 03:13.120
Like, that idea just, she won't shut up about it about two o'clock in the morning.

03:13.120 --> 03:17.840
So then I got a text at midnight that was like, hey, I know I just woke you up,

03:17.840 --> 03:19.520
but there's another, I got, I thought of another thing.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.360
Like, I want to tell you about the womb.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.240
It was great in there.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.240
It's super cool in there.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.240
Can you try to recreate that environment for me, and if you recreate it with,

03:28.240 --> 03:33.200
without like landing it right within like 99% accuracy, I will scream at you.

03:33.200 --> 03:38.000
I will scream at you, and I will scream at, I will scream at mom forever.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.560
Um, no, I slept great.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.840
It's hard.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.200
Sometimes my baby wakes up at like 715, and I really wanted to sleep till 730.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.120
So it's really difficult.

03:49.120 --> 03:54.000
Justin Tyler, I have, I have been in your home when your child was screaming.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.240
I don't want to hear this bullshit from you.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.440
Those are the old days, Travis.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.280
It's, I'm on easy street now.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.000
But I'll get there too, this attitude of yours as though you can't remember what it was like

04:04.000 --> 04:05.600
to not sleep great.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.880
I won't stand for it.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.400
Yeah, no, that's not a good character.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.920
No, I, this is my new character, uh, that I'm going with.

04:11.920 --> 04:19.280
Uh, you know the secret, here's the secret, here's the secret, the secret is that I hired,

04:19.280 --> 04:24.720
uh, Muldoon from Jurassic Park to come in and shoot her with a tranq dart every night.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.320
Oh, is that, she's, now she is learning how to open doors.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.440
That part is true.

04:29.440 --> 04:34.160
So Muldoon does have a little bit of a trouble tracking her down sometimes.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.640
And she's hunting in packs with my cats.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.040
So that, that's another one that is difficult.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.120
But he does come in, just tranq her every night.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.520
She goes down real, I mean, we'll do her book.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.680
We do the book in bed and the PJs.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.720
That's never enough.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.160
That's never enough because then we have to call Muldoon to come over.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.600
That raptor cocktail.

04:51.600 --> 04:59.520
I'll tell you what though, that's the trade-off is my baby owns my ass and Rachel's ass from

04:59.520 --> 05:00.640
during the night times.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.680
But during the day times, it's like, what do you want to watch, baby?

05:03.680 --> 05:06.720
Because I hope it's Terrace House because that's what we're fucking watching.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.200
What do you want?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.400
You want to watch Friday Night Lights?

05:08.400 --> 05:12.560
Oh, you don't get a vote because you can't like do anything or say anything about it.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.720
But you have the opposite, I feel like.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.640
Or it's like, what do you want to watch, Charlie?

05:16.640 --> 05:19.600
It's like, oh damn, Pee-wee's Christmas special again.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.560
Okay, all right.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.920
Yeah, but that's a bad example because that rules.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.920
But we watched it three times while I was in town for the TV show and I love that special.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.680
But you can only laugh at the magic screen as my cousin so many times.

05:31.680 --> 05:36.000
And it should be clear when Griffin says when we're in town shooting, it was September.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.640
So we were jumping the gun a little bit.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.000
I actually, a big thank you to A Sleepless Night with My Child.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.040
I played her, you know, like sound making mobile and it reminded me of the theme music

05:47.040 --> 05:48.000
from Dark Cloud.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.360
And then I found that Dark Cloud was available on the PlayStation 4 store.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.560
Bye bye, Travis.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.760
That's what I've been doing.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.640
Goodbye, everybody.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.400
I just remembered Dark Cloud existed.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.080
That's, what else do we do on this one?

06:02.080 --> 06:03.520
It's not going to be all dad stuff.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.640
I know that there's probably legitimate fear that it's going to be all dad stuff.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.240
It's really, it's not going to be all dad stuff because I'm honestly, I'm over it.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.840
So like, I've moved way on.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.680
And I'm way in denial about it.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.160
I'm trying real hard to pretend like I don't have a kid.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.000
I'm like, I can't see her right now.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.680
So she doesn't exist.

06:19.680 --> 06:19.920
Sure.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.800
So both of you are having some object permanence issues.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.080
Yeah.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.000
I'm leaning way into it, baby.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.520
Pass me that fucking Bud Light.

06:27.520 --> 06:34.160
Ka-chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.400
That's not just the theme song to Home Improvement.

06:36.400 --> 06:40.640
And a lot of people don't know this, but anytime Tim Allen's involved in a project

06:40.640 --> 06:44.720
and he plays a dad, then that has to be the theme song for it.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.120
And he wrote it, obviously.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.600
That was not the work of a master composer who's like,

06:49.600 --> 06:52.640
well, all right, let me show you this fucking, let me show you this bar,

06:53.360 --> 06:56.400
this sheet music and the notes just go down.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.440
And then there's an, uh, at the end of it.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.040
Just one more quick dad story.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.360
We were visiting Travis and Teresa and his baby, Bebe.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.600
And the highlight of the trip for me is I taught Charlie how to say

07:09.600 --> 07:11.200
she was going to kick Travis's ass.

07:11.200 --> 07:11.680
Oh, good.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.560
She just, she just followed Travis around the apartment saying,

07:14.560 --> 07:15.840
I'm going to kick your ass.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.920
Yeah, very eloquently, too.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.000
Like, this was not like cute baby speak.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.120
She looked at me dead in the eye and was like, I am going to kick your ass.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.880
It was very intimidating.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.360
The two are so tied in their house that when we got home,

07:28.160 --> 07:31.920
we said, did you have a good time visiting with baby Bebe?

07:31.920 --> 07:32.800
And she said, yeah.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.280
And she said, and we said, and Teresa?

07:35.280 --> 07:36.240
And she said, yeah.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.520
And we said, and Uncle Travis?

07:37.520 --> 07:39.040
She said, I'm going to kick his ass.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.080
She's going to try.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.520
She can fucking try.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.720
I'm way bigger than her.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.160
Travis is a big man.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.040
I'm going to kick your ass.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.120
She also spent the whole time just so that there is benefit to the dad stories.

07:51.120 --> 07:55.440
She also kept like laying a hand on my baby and saying, so cute.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.400
It was great.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.840
She loves baby Bebe very much.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.440
I'm going to kick your daddy's ass.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.240
Yeah, that was weird.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.520
That was a bit of a turn off.

08:01.520 --> 08:02.800
Here comes our first question.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.680
Well, I want to say real quick because we, I wasn't here last week.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.160
We did our best.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.040
I think thanks to everybody for the well wishes.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.480
We had a baby on Black Friday.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.920
And everybody's doing really well.

08:13.920 --> 08:19.040
So and a lot of people sent some nice tweets and messages and some nice stuff to our PO box.

08:19.040 --> 08:19.840
And we really appreciate it.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.400
So thanks, y'all.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.800
Here comes our first question.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.040
My sister thinks it's normal to use the term

08:25.040 --> 08:29.840
lovers to refer to a couple in casual conversation.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.520
Our friend and I think this is pretty super gross.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.920
How can we explain to her how nasty the word lovers is?

08:37.920 --> 08:40.080
That's an off put in the OC.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.960
Is your sister like, I think it was.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.720
Who is the woman who did the SNL bit with Will Ferrell?

08:46.720 --> 08:47.840
Dratch.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.120
Yeah, Rachel Dratch.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.880
Is that what that's what we're dealing with?

08:50.880 --> 08:52.000
Like the whole premise of that.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.760
We all lived through the 90s and early thousands, right?

08:55.760 --> 08:57.120
Like we all saw that sketch.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.280
Like we understand that it's off the table.

08:59.280 --> 09:04.480
You realize there's people that exist right now who are 16 who don't remember anything

09:04.480 --> 09:06.160
before 2000, right?

09:06.160 --> 09:06.560
Shit.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.000
That's a fair point.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.040
It's unacceptable.

09:10.160 --> 09:10.960
You can't.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.720
You simply can't because you say lovers and lovers means one thing.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.760
And that is that they fuck all the time.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.400
The only way you get to use that is if you see two people casually fucking each other.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.480
Then you can say, look at those lovers.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.640
Otherwise you are assuming.

09:26.640 --> 09:27.920
It's not just that it's active.

09:27.920 --> 09:28.560
It's active.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.040
Like descriptor, right?

09:31.040 --> 09:36.160
Like if I go to a barbershop and I see a man or a woman

09:36.160 --> 09:38.400
cutting some hair so that there's a barber.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.320
A lover suggests like this person does it like it's their job.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.960
These two people do it like it's their job.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.320
Wait, I'm going to stop you, Griffin, though,

09:48.320 --> 09:51.440
because that would imply that if you saw him anywhere else,

09:51.440 --> 09:54.720
he ceases to be a barber unless he is barbering.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.840
No, if I've seen them barber, then I know I've classified them.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.720
What Griffin's saying is not that he is forever cutting hair.

10:00.720 --> 10:05.600
It's that he has achieved a level to where he can be called that as a professional.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.960
I've seen it.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.000
You're a barber.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.120
Don't try and disguise it.

10:09.120 --> 10:13.600
Lovers means like, hi, you might as well say like these are my friends,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.000
you know, Derek and Michael.

10:16.000 --> 10:16.960
They bone.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.760
That's what's up.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.680
That's what's up.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.680
I'm actually on the other side of this.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.200
I've reached a time in my life where I'm old and irrelevant

10:25.200 --> 10:29.120
and really the only way that I can try to get the upper hand in conversation.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.480
Like I can't tell people about the new Weekend album because I haven't heard it.

10:32.480 --> 10:36.720
But I can use uncomfortable words to try to set them off,

10:36.720 --> 10:41.280
to try to get the power balance back into my level.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.240
Do you remember?

10:42.240 --> 10:43.600
You know what's interesting about this to me?

10:43.600 --> 10:44.720
It just occurred to me, right?

10:45.280 --> 10:48.560
Griffin and I at least draw on the same page that lovers is weird, right?

10:48.560 --> 10:52.080
I'm going to add one word to it that's going to change the way you feel about that.

10:52.080 --> 10:52.480
You ready?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.160
Young lovers.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.400
No, bud.

10:56.400 --> 10:56.880
Really?

10:56.880 --> 11:00.080
Okay, see, I'm on the side of using young lovers as like a cute,

11:00.080 --> 11:05.680
springtime, Twitter-pated, all befuddled about one another.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.480
You look at those young lovers out for a stroll through the park.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.960
I don't think saying look at those young lovers implies like...

11:10.960 --> 11:12.560
No, bud.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.280
No, bud.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.160
No, bud.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.040
It does.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.000
No, it doesn't.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.640
No, wait.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.600
Justin, hold on.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.320
Hold on, Griffin.

11:18.320 --> 11:18.960
Excuse me one second.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.080
I really forgot to Justin.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.000
Justin, you have to be on my side about this.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.520
You were on board with lovers.

11:23.520 --> 11:23.920
If I feel young and...

11:23.920 --> 11:26.480
I was on board with lovers because it made people uncomfortable.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.120
I'm fully in the camp.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.560
Young lovers is worse because it's drawing attention to how old you are

11:33.280 --> 11:36.240
and how you're an old person who shouldn't be saying such things.

11:36.240 --> 11:40.880
I can think of a word that would go before lovers that would make it palatable,

11:40.880 --> 11:43.040
and it is meat.

11:43.040 --> 11:43.360
Okay.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.880
I hear meat lovers and I say like, when?

11:46.880 --> 11:47.360
Where?

11:47.360 --> 11:48.080
Where?

11:48.080 --> 11:48.800
I'm there.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.000
How much?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.600
Please no Canadian bacon.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.000
Please.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.800
That's just ham.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.840
You can't trick me.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.200
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

11:55.840 --> 11:56.240
Hit me.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.080
This Yahoo was sent in...

11:58.080 --> 11:59.600
Oh man, I got a lot of good ones.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.680
When you take a week off and...

12:02.320 --> 12:04.960
Maybe we should switch to bi-weekly like Adventure Zone

12:04.960 --> 12:06.480
because we get so much good stuff.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.000
No, we shouldn't even joke about that.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.160
Okay, how about this one sent in by Ed Bauman.

12:10.160 --> 12:10.640
Thank you, Ed.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.960
It's Yahoo Answers user John who asks,

12:14.560 --> 12:18.960
how do I stop people on Facebook from taking credit of my food pics?

12:21.440 --> 12:23.760
I love sharing food pics,

12:23.760 --> 12:27.600
and I am afraid people will save my pictures and pretend they made the food.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.760
How can I avoid this from happening?

12:29.760 --> 12:30.320
Hold on.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.840
There's a real Chameleon twist in there.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.600
Yeah, in that it's not happening.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.240
It's an imaginary...

12:36.240 --> 12:38.000
It's not happening actively.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.680
He's just afraid it will happen.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.360
This is not a thing that happens.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.520
So here's what you do.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.480
I'll just solve it for you.

12:44.480 --> 12:44.960
No big deal.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.280
Every time you make a dish, you write your name on it and catch up.

12:51.280 --> 12:51.680
Jacob's...

12:51.680 --> 12:52.400
You make some...

12:52.400 --> 12:54.880
You make some omurice.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.000
You want some omurice shit?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.800
Oh, Justin, I'm so happy that you're watching Terrace House.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.120
It fulfills me in a spiritual way.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.880
You write Phil's food pics,

13:04.880 --> 13:07.920
and I'm assuming food is pH just to keep...

13:07.920 --> 13:09.200
Or Phil is with an F.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.160
It's your call.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.760
And actually, pics is also pH but pronounced differently.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.200
Yeah, with three X's,

13:15.200 --> 13:18.320
and you just write Phil's food pics and catch up on every one,

13:18.320 --> 13:20.480
so they'll never be able to take that from you.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.040
Can we all agree that if you post a food picture,

13:23.040 --> 13:25.680
you're actually only doing that for yourself?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.440
You don't actually think anyone else in the world

13:27.440 --> 13:30.400
is going to look at the food you ate and appreciate it.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.800
It's so like in a year, you can look back and be like,

13:32.800 --> 13:34.080
damn, that was a good sandwich.

13:34.080 --> 13:34.720
It's savage.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.960
No, it's savagery because the only response...

13:36.960 --> 13:38.800
Sometimes I'll post pics of Blue Apron meals

13:38.800 --> 13:40.640
that come out especially picturesque,

13:40.640 --> 13:42.800
and the only response I ever get is like,

13:42.800 --> 13:44.560
ah, fuck, I'm so hungry.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.360
It's like, oh, no, because that will only...

13:47.360 --> 13:48.480
I didn't mean to make you hungry.

13:48.480 --> 13:48.880
I'm sorry.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.880
I was just sharing this great food pic.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.640
I like seeing it though.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.760
I like seeing it.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.080
I have certain friends on Instagram and co-workers

13:56.640 --> 13:58.480
that they live in New York,

13:58.480 --> 14:00.160
and so they're eating good food all the time,

14:00.160 --> 14:02.160
and I just follow them on Instagram because it's like,

14:02.160 --> 14:04.320
whoa, I didn't even know Robin could do that.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.440
That looks good as hell.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.320
Well done.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.280
I think of those people in my mind that I don't know very well,

14:09.280 --> 14:10.800
but I follow them on Instagram,

14:10.800 --> 14:12.320
and all they post is good food pics.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.400
I'm like, that's a cool person

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
because they eat good food all the time.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.240
They are living very, very right.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.600
Do you know who has the best at that?

14:19.600 --> 14:21.360
You know who's the best at that?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.080
Who?

14:22.080 --> 14:23.440
Mr. Aziz Ansari.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.560
Oh, yeah.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.840
Well, yeah, he's living the dream.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.880
He's always eating.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.480
Food pics are on point.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.360
They're very good stuff.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.440
But how do I stop people on Facebook

14:31.440 --> 14:34.160
from taking credit of my food pics is the real question

14:34.160 --> 14:36.720
because I'll be honest, we've all done it.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.800
I saw my friend Susan put up a pic of ribs,

14:38.800 --> 14:40.560
and I was like, my ribs.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.560
You're going to need like a micro dot,

14:44.560 --> 14:46.480
like something hidden within the photo

14:46.480 --> 14:50.640
that if you zoom in 12 times proves that it was yours,

14:50.640 --> 14:52.880
and then that's your secret watermark

14:52.880 --> 14:54.640
that they'll never know to remove.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.560
Or you hide something embarrassing in the background.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.560
If you know your friend,

15:02.880 --> 15:04.800
Jerrica is going to steal it,

15:04.800 --> 15:06.400
is going to steal your food pics,

15:06.400 --> 15:07.920
and she's done it before,

15:07.920 --> 15:09.760
I made a watercress salad,

15:09.760 --> 15:10.960
and she stole it and she said,

15:10.960 --> 15:13.040
this is Jerrica's watercress salad.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.400
Then you put up a pic, a food pic,

15:16.400 --> 15:18.800
and it's like, here's some turkey burgers I made,

15:18.800 --> 15:19.760
and they turned out really great.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.440
Jerrica's like, my turkey burgers.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.720
You delete your picture,

15:23.280 --> 15:25.200
and then you comment on Jerrica's picture and say like,

15:25.200 --> 15:26.160
what's that in the background?

15:26.160 --> 15:27.120
It's a little turd.

15:27.840 --> 15:28.400
Nice.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.480
You hid a little turd in the background of the picture,

15:30.480 --> 15:31.760
and she didn't see it.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.080
She didn't do it.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.120
Oh, but then her shit goes viral quite literally.

15:35.120 --> 15:35.760
Yeah.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.560
She becomes famous, but she becomes famous?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.520
Well, I don't want her to become,

15:41.520 --> 15:44.880
no, I'm just trying to teach her like a lesson about stealing.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.680
Everyone hates her,

15:45.680 --> 15:47.040
and you've ruined Jerrica's life.

15:47.040 --> 15:47.920
No, I don't want to do that.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.560
I don't want to do that.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.000
You did, Griffin.

15:50.000 --> 15:50.880
Her life is ruined.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.480
She can't get a job now.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.720
Can't you just call out the exif data?

15:54.720 --> 15:57.440
Just like, I'm checking the location stamp on this photo,

15:57.440 --> 15:58.800
and oh, that's weird.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.480
It was taken at my Aunt Jackie's house.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.360
I didn't realize that you guys were so close together.

16:03.360 --> 16:03.840
That's so weird.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.720
Unfortunately, Justin, the problem is that that can be faked.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.440
You actually have to take the picture before you post it,

16:09.440 --> 16:12.000
print it out, mail it to yourself.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.760
Don't open the envelope.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.000
But once you receive the envelope, don't open it.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.440
Then you can post it.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.960
And that, I think that works in any court of law.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.200
You know that legally, that doesn't work.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.560
It doesn't hold up in court,

16:25.520 --> 16:28.720
unless you write the jig is up on the envelope.

16:28.720 --> 16:33.120
Because that way, imagine like you post a food pic that you stole,

16:33.120 --> 16:34.640
and then you get an envelope in the mail.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.920
It just says the jig is up.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.720
Or like you're in a court, and the judge is like,

16:38.720 --> 16:39.920
anybody have any evidence?

16:41.520 --> 16:43.360
And then you stand up in the back of the court,

16:43.360 --> 16:45.600
and you just have this huge envelope that says the jig is up.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.480
Well, hold on, Justin.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.320
I'm gonna give a little bit of change there.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.840
You have addressed the envelope to the court, to the judge.

16:51.840 --> 16:55.520
Yeah, and it gets delivered, hand delivered by someone running in,

16:55.520 --> 16:57.600
going, wait, hold on, before you rule,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.600
I do have this letter for you, judge.

16:59.600 --> 17:06.240
P.O. Box Court, C.O. Judge, the jig is up, colon, evidence.

17:06.240 --> 17:11.360
New, new shocking evidence is important.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.760
You write new shocking evidence on there,

17:13.760 --> 17:15.600
because you got to entice him into opening it.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.640
If it looks boring, the judge probably won't even check it out.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.800
Don't put that or resident shit on there,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.480
or that judge will never open it.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.120
Love, love Reggie.

17:25.120 --> 17:28.320
Why does it say, why did you put love Reggie on the envelope?

17:28.320 --> 17:30.960
When you open it, it's just full of like glitter,

17:30.960 --> 17:33.120
but also the picture of your food.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.360
Why does it say on the back, why does it say me undies?

17:35.360 --> 17:36.880
Well, I reuse the envelope.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.720
Okay, it's resealable.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.000
I don't know what you want from me.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.600
Why did they make me undies?

17:41.600 --> 17:42.640
Why is it resealable?

17:42.640 --> 17:44.480
I'm not gonna put my underpants back in there.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.000
Me undies, I love you.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.600
You know this, I'm wearing you now,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.920
and you are literally all I own in the underwear game.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.000
You've got your underwear game so strong.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.120
Why does the package that you come in reseal?

17:55.120 --> 17:58.800
I'm not gonna, I don't think I'm gonna need that one again.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.360
I don't think I'm gonna, no, no.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.320
No, I'm gonna put you in the boo-boo box.

18:04.320 --> 18:08.400
Here's another question.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.360
I just recently moved into an apartment

18:11.360 --> 18:12.320
with four other girls.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.560
While I was putting my kitchen things away on move-in day,

18:14.560 --> 18:15.520
I noticed that one of my roommates

18:15.520 --> 18:18.560
has a ridiculous amount of Cheers themed dishware,

18:18.560 --> 18:21.200
as in they all have the Cheers TV show logo on them.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.320
I'm not even joking.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.200
There are so many cheers and blazing cups, plates, and bowls

18:25.200 --> 18:27.120
that they're taking over all of our cabinets.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.800
How can I tell my roommate I'd rather not have,

18:28.800 --> 18:32.640
I'd rather have some more conservative dishware

18:32.640 --> 18:34.880
than a full tribute to Frasier Crane?

18:34.880 --> 18:37.040
Cheerful in Columbus is who this is from,

18:37.040 --> 18:38.800
but I'm gonna say Adufus.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.240
This is from Adufus.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.240
Because I would be so happy every single day of my life

18:44.240 --> 18:46.080
if everybody knew my cups,

18:46.080 --> 18:49.920
because they knew that I had Cheers memorabilia.

18:49.920 --> 18:54.160
There is no TV show that I would find

18:54.160 --> 18:57.680
this an unacceptable arrangement for.

18:57.680 --> 19:02.880
All my plates and cups have Boston Legal logos on it.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.440
Never seen a fucking episode of it.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.520
Oh, I was gonna say Boston Commons.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.240
Oh, shit.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.680
All of them, Rescue 911.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.880
Never seen the program.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.840
I haven't seen the program, but come on over.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.480
I've got a story to tell.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.040
It's amazing.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.040
I'm so jealous.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.280
How fantastic.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.640
That is fantastic.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.640
Okay, here's my theory as to what has happened here.

19:23.360 --> 19:27.280
This person, they went to, let's say Goodwill,

19:27.280 --> 19:30.160
and they saw like a Cheers mug

19:30.160 --> 19:32.880
or like a set of four Cheers glasses,

19:32.880 --> 19:34.560
and they thought that was ironic

19:34.560 --> 19:37.520
to have those in their barware set.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.560
They had those at home.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.360
Then grandma came over and visited.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.640
They gave them a glass, right, of water in the Cheers cup.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.640
Grandma goes, oh, they like Cheers.

19:46.640 --> 19:46.960
Cheers.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.240
You're a norm head too, huh?

19:50.960 --> 19:52.480
And then that's all they're getting

19:52.480 --> 19:54.240
for like the next eight Christmases.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.320
It's all Cheers memorabilia.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.400
I just had a great realization.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.800
Now that the information about our TV show is public,

20:02.800 --> 20:04.880
we can tell this slam dunk Cheers story.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.840
Hell yeah.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.960
So we're in Boston.

20:06.960 --> 20:10.560
This isn't a great, I don't, it's a fun story for us.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.800
I wouldn't call it a slam dunk story.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.720
Well, you haven't even heard me tell it.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.440
Oh, you're right.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.600
I found the drama in it, and I can twist it anyway.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.240
So we're staying at the hotel

20:22.240 --> 20:25.120
and we're looking for places to go nearby,

20:25.120 --> 20:28.960
and our showrunner, JD Amato, took a train in six hours

20:29.520 --> 20:33.120
to come to us in Boston to talk to us about the TV show

20:33.120 --> 20:34.800
because we're gonna like have a meeting

20:34.800 --> 20:36.640
about what we want this TV show to be like.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.800
So JD shows up and he's like, guys, where are we going?

20:38.800 --> 20:39.520
He's from New York.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.600
He doesn't know the cool places.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.440
And Travis is like, I got a place.

20:43.440 --> 20:48.800
So we start walking a lot and it is beyond sweltering.

20:48.800 --> 20:52.400
I mean, it is over 100 degrees, absolutely miserable.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.440
And we've walked maybe six blocks before Travis reveals to us

20:55.440 --> 20:57.040
that we're going to Cheers.

20:57.040 --> 21:01.120
We walk another 20 minutes conservatively

21:01.120 --> 21:04.160
and we cannot find the place

21:04.160 --> 21:06.720
and we're just kind of wandering for a little while.

21:06.720 --> 21:11.200
And JD says, boy, I hope that you guys really like Cheers

21:11.200 --> 21:12.640
to make this worth it.

21:12.640 --> 21:16.880
And Travis reveals that he has not actually ever watched Cheers,

21:18.080 --> 21:20.800
which Griffin echoes and then I double echo.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.000
Yeah, I missed Cheers.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.160
Actually, none of us have watched Cheers.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.360
And he was very, very disappointed at us.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.480
Fast forward to us actually finding Cheers

21:30.480 --> 21:33.680
and we go downstairs and it was too crowded.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.360
So we stole a pin and left and ate at a pizza place.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.520
They said it's a 100 hour wait.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.800
And I said, what's my name?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.080
And they said, I don't know.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.680
And I said, fuck you, bye.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.280
But we did get our picture in front of Cheers.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.120
They do have a person there that takes your name

21:51.120 --> 21:52.560
to put in your reservation.

21:52.560 --> 21:57.280
That must be the worst job on planet Earth.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.440
You are hearing this name, please.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.760
Don't you know it already?

22:01.760 --> 22:05.280
Like every, like literally 20 times a day.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.200
That's that person's entire existence.

22:07.200 --> 22:07.760
That's worse.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.480
I'd rather clean the shitters at Cheers

22:10.480 --> 22:12.880
than be the person who greets people there.

22:12.880 --> 22:13.760
I don't know, Justin.

22:13.760 --> 22:19.440
There, someone every day is just destroying the shitters.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.760
This place is an iconic TV landmark.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.320
I've been saving up my dumb skis all week.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.080
You never think that when people yell norm,

22:30.080 --> 22:32.640
it may be a warning that he's about to go in there

22:32.640 --> 22:37.040
and just strip my in the potty in a really savage way.

22:37.040 --> 22:40.400
He's had a long work day and he's just gonna,

22:40.400 --> 22:42.640
he's just gonna have a terrible,

22:42.640 --> 22:44.640
terrible episode in there every day.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.720
I'm gonna go to this later this year.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.400
Me and my wife are taking a trip to Seattle.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.360
I'm gonna shoot a Duke in the Grey's Anatomy Hospital.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.000
Fuck yeah.

22:53.120 --> 22:56.240
I've been, I shot Dukes in major landmarks

22:56.240 --> 22:58.560
in all 50 of these American states.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.880
I couldn't get in the San Francisco house

23:00.880 --> 23:04.560
from fucking full house, but I sure did it in the backyard.

23:05.120 --> 23:05.680
Hey, you know the-

23:05.680 --> 23:08.560
Me and Comet both shit in the backyard.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.120
You know the Comet bathroom in Ally McBeal?

23:11.120 --> 23:12.720
Yep, dumped in it.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.360
Dumped there.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.760
Name a bathroom in a TV show.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.040
I'll tell you if I dumped there.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.280
I dumped in John Adams High.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.960
I dumped at Bayside.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.280
I dumped, I dumped in two Tardises.

23:26.800 --> 23:27.520
Two of them.

23:28.160 --> 23:28.800
Two of them.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.520
Fucking fucking Capaldi.

23:31.520 --> 23:35.200
Best day of my life, dumped in doctor number two's Tardis.

23:35.200 --> 23:35.680
It was great.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.040
It felt real good.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.760
Carolyn was in the city, but Devon was in the shitter

23:39.760 --> 23:40.880
and he had his way.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.880
Hey, I was inside Veronica's closet.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.960
I took a dump in it.

23:46.960 --> 23:50.320
I left a major Torgleson in that bathroom.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.240
Torgleson all over that one.

23:52.880 --> 23:53.760
Growing pains.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.800
I hear you, my man.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.960
I had some of my own in there.

23:56.960 --> 24:00.880
Or like going pains, because I ate a lot of roughage.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.480
This is my new favorite character.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.720
Hey, guys, good news, the Patty Duke show writes itself.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.240
I left a dirty little liar lying right on the floor.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.800
Dear Matt Greening, I have a weird request for you.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.000
I need you to draw me.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.200
I need this, please.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.000
Please.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.080
This is my white whale.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.640
Oh, shit.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.360
Another Yahoo?

24:35.360 --> 24:36.000
Yes, please.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.000
Do you think the third Rock from the Sun toilet flush is weird?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.440
Like all space and aliens and stuff?

24:41.440 --> 24:44.480
Oh, hell yeah, dude, that show fucking is so funny.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.520
Here's a good Yahoo and it was sent in by Morgan Davey.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.480
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.760
Thank you, it's Yahoo Answers user.

24:51.760 --> 24:57.120
Wonder Bob asks, I need to fake like I've smoked pot before.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.360
Here's the sitch.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.200
I'm going to hang out with my friend tomorrow.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.640
He's a bit of a stoner.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.680
He's under the impression that I'm a regular smoker of pot.

25:05.680 --> 25:09.280
I am not, but in all likelihood, I will smoke pot at his house tomorrow.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.760
So I need to be able to act like I do it regularly.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.320
Help.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.520
First of all, I'm glad you came to us.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.600
Don't weed.

25:18.160 --> 25:21.920
Weed is not for mead is what they tell you to say.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.080
How do you pretend like, oh, this good thing?

25:30.080 --> 25:31.120
Oh, this stuff?

25:31.120 --> 25:31.760
Oh, thanks.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.680
How do I start it?

25:33.680 --> 25:34.240
Just kidding.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.280
I know how to start it.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.480
You know what the thing is about that?

25:38.480 --> 25:43.600
The best thing about this is that when it comes to weed, as it's been explained to me

25:43.600 --> 25:46.400
by many young people, because I wouldn't know.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.240
Yeah, like from comedy movies.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.000
Like comedy movies and such and, you know, pamphlets I've read.

25:52.880 --> 25:58.560
It's that there are so many different, I believe it's called strains, different varieties,

25:59.600 --> 26:04.000
and different ways that people smoke them that like, all you have to say is like,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.040
oh, how do you do it?

26:05.040 --> 26:08.160
Oh, that's not what I learned.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.240
I rub it on my fucking eyes.

26:12.720 --> 26:16.400
I put a stick on the end and rub it back and forth real fast, like on Survivor,

26:16.400 --> 26:17.840
when they're trying to start a fire.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.440
That's how I kind of get it going.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.560
Is that not what you do?

26:20.560 --> 26:22.480
In those scenes where they smoke weed on Survivor.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.800
The fact of the matter is everybody's self-conscious about how they smoke weed.

26:26.800 --> 26:27.360
Everybody.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.080
Even like the person who's done it a bajillion times.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.880
I think that you're probably wild.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.880
I think that may be the dumbest thing you've ever said.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.240
You don't think that everyone, you don't think that everyone who has ever smoked weed

26:38.240 --> 26:40.800
is constantly looking for a better way to do it?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.240
YouTube.com.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.440
Going right now.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.560
You're coming with me, Travis.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.160
Cool weed tricks.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.480
Okay, let me rephrase.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.120
98% of the people who smoke weed are constantly-

26:53.120 --> 26:57.040
66,500 people are saying, check out my good stuff.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.120
Okay, 66,500 people.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.400
That can't be all the people using weed.

27:00.400 --> 27:03.600
A lot of these are compilations, so inflate that number.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.960
I have news for you, Travis.

27:04.960 --> 27:09.760
If people who are smoking weed are regularly spending that time worrying about how they're

27:09.760 --> 27:14.480
smoking it, they're smoking very bad marijuana and they should probably get some different

27:14.480 --> 27:19.200
ones because as far as I understand, you're smoking weed to do exactly the opposite of

27:19.200 --> 27:20.320
what you're describing.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.440
Yes, Justin, because no one's ever smoked weed and then gotten nervous.

27:24.160 --> 27:24.640
Come on.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.480
I'm not saying I'm not saying nervous.

27:26.480 --> 27:31.280
I'm saying that like what you said is a ludicrous thing that like people like people who smoke

27:31.280 --> 27:34.720
weed a lot are like, I know I could be doing this better anyway.

27:35.360 --> 27:39.120
Well, like I said, I've never done it before because I'm a good, good boy.

27:39.120 --> 27:39.360
Yeah.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.880
And Nani, if you're listening, I've never-

27:42.880 --> 27:44.320
I'm afraid of this stuff.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.600
Yeah, it's bad for me is what I've heard.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.960
What if I die from using it?

27:46.960 --> 27:51.440
I just assume that everyone must be trying to do it better or else why would they keep

27:51.440 --> 27:51.840
doing it?

27:51.840 --> 27:54.080
Doesn't- aren't they trying to master it?

27:54.080 --> 27:58.400
Like, you know, like that 10,000 hours Malcolm Gladwell shit.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.320
Everybody smokes weed to get better at it.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.920
You guys also look at Malcolm Gladwell and just think like-

28:04.640 --> 28:05.600
Oh, he parties.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.400
I bet he parties.

28:07.200 --> 28:07.840
Oh, yeah.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.760
He's an outlier, if you know what I mean.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.920
I also like, it's a criminal crime.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.640
What?

28:14.640 --> 28:16.480
It's a criminal crime to do it.

28:17.920 --> 28:18.800
Not everywhere.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.520
Not for everybody.

28:20.640 --> 28:24.000
I mean, it is for me, so it should be for everybody, but that's beside the point.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.600
But like, I don't go around and like take other people's cars and like have- now I have that

28:29.600 --> 28:30.000
one.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.240
Now I have this Pontiac Grand Prix.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.040
You know what I mean?

28:33.040 --> 28:36.560
Like, I don't walk into Burger King and take all the food in there without paying for it.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.720
I guess that makes sense.

28:40.720 --> 28:47.440
Although, from what I understand, if I did have one of those goobies, then I probably

28:47.440 --> 28:51.280
would go to Burger King and eat all the food there because of- I guess you get super hungry?

28:51.840 --> 28:55.920
Yeah, and then you steal a car to get to Burger King because you're so hungry from smoking

28:55.920 --> 28:56.880
the gooby.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.840
Yeah, and I don't want to crash my car because I'm all goobed out.

28:59.840 --> 29:00.800
Hold on, there's somebody at the door.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.840
Oh, just- are you sure?

29:05.840 --> 29:07.520
Just read it on- okay.

29:09.840 --> 29:16.320
Guys, I've just gotten an official note from the president and it says that we're all

29:16.320 --> 29:23.120
dads now and it's actually legally been- it says here, legally been too long since you

29:23.120 --> 29:29.120
smoked weed to be able to joke about it on your podcast and have anything that approaches

29:29.840 --> 29:30.960
relevance or comedy.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.800
I mean, it's just- and it's got his stamp-

29:32.800 --> 29:33.760
He stamped it.

29:33.760 --> 29:34.720
I mistake.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.560
It is from Joe Biden, which does- that tracks.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.600
Oh, that makes sense.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.080
That tracks.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.040
Oh, okay.

29:39.040 --> 29:39.920
That tracks.

29:39.920 --> 29:44.320
Because I was thinking like President Barack Hussein Obama, a lot of people forget the

29:44.320 --> 29:46.720
Hussein support, that he's busy.

29:47.360 --> 29:51.120
He's got a lot of stuff going on right now because he's like scrambling to like, what

29:51.120 --> 29:53.600
can I do to like hold this thing together?

29:53.600 --> 29:55.520
But Joe- Joe Bags.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.080
Joey Bag of Donuts.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.400
You know he's- I would expect this from him.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.720
So no more- we can't do it anymore?

30:02.720 --> 30:04.160
We can't do weed jokes anymore.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.840
We actually can't do weed jokes.

30:05.840 --> 30:10.560
He says if you smoke it again, the timer resets.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.440
Oh, wait, hold on.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.080
Sorry, hold on.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.640
Oh, sorry, my door.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.840
I got a letter from Joe Biden too.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.040
Oh, shit.

30:19.040 --> 30:24.400
That if we ever want to do another weed question again, we'll have to do an all high episode.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.080
Oh, where we all get- okay.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.920
I have a child though.

30:27.920 --> 30:28.720
Listen, I do too.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.760
Listen, I'm right there with you.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.800
We're all on the same page.

30:30.800 --> 30:31.520
I don't know.

30:31.520 --> 30:36.080
This is just letting people know that maybe we need to take a weed joke break for a while.

30:36.080 --> 30:36.320
Okay.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.240
Yeah, we can't joke about weed anymore.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.560
But in like- in like 2022-

30:40.560 --> 30:41.680
When it's all people?

30:41.680 --> 30:42.000
No, no, no.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.880
I'm saying like in 2022, my- my- my boy, my very special boy is going to be like, this

30:46.880 --> 30:47.760
is for him now.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.920
Henry, that was- daddy was joking.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.680
Daddy- daddy was joking.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.680
It was never- it was never real.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.880
It was all for jokes.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.560
For the audience.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.160
For fun.

30:58.160 --> 30:58.960
For daddy's job.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.920
Daddy's just having fun.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.080
Daddy's just having fun with his friends, hon.

31:03.280 --> 31:03.680
Honey.

31:05.120 --> 31:08.960
Go back and watch some more, uh, Barney 2.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.880
The sequel to Barney.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.120
The raunchy, edgy sequel of Barney.

31:13.120 --> 31:17.040
The fucking gritty remake of Barney that we have in the future.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.200
This is- this is my brother, Barno.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.400
I've got a gun.

31:20.400 --> 31:20.640
What?

31:22.000 --> 31:22.720
Barno, no.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.160
What?

31:24.160 --> 31:25.120
Build the wall.

31:25.120 --> 31:25.920
What?

31:25.920 --> 31:26.400
Barney?

31:27.120 --> 31:28.240
You shouldn't have a gun.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.240
No, it's cool if you know how to use it.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.280
Barno?

31:31.280 --> 31:32.320
I'm telling you, man.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.840
Dig these- dig these crazy guns.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.920
Pry it out of my toughy purple talons.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.360
Uh, let's go to the money zone.

31:45.360 --> 31:45.680
Oh, wait.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.840
I have somebody at my door.

31:47.840 --> 31:48.640
God almighty.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.600
Some Thai food I ordered earlier.

31:54.800 --> 31:57.200
Well, if you want to pay for it, we're going to need to go to the money zone.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.880
Our first sponsor this week is Trunk Club.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.440
Travis, you always do such a good job talking about Trunk Club.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.360
Can you- can you repeat the magic?

32:15.360 --> 32:19.520
Oh, do you mean tell about the best pants I've ever owned in my entire life?

32:19.520 --> 32:20.160
That's the one.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.360
Here's the thing.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.560
Let me tell you a little story.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.480
No, it's not a story.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.040
That's not true.

32:25.040 --> 32:29.600
The story is like a thing that happened, but this is more observations than anything else.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.200
If you're like me, then you're the type of person who looks at clothes and thinks,

32:33.840 --> 32:36.960
how the hell am I supposed to know what clothes are worth it?

32:36.960 --> 32:40.240
Because yeah, there's options where I could pay like $100 for a shirt,

32:40.240 --> 32:42.240
but that just seems like I'm flushing my money away.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.520
I don't know anything about shirts.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.120
Let me tell you something.

32:45.120 --> 32:49.040
I bought some pants from Trunk Club and they are, without a doubt,

32:49.040 --> 32:54.800
no joke, no exaggeration, no smoke, the best pants I've ever owned in my life.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.240
How many pockets- how many pockets they got?

32:56.960 --> 32:57.920
A billion.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.000
No, like a normal amount, like five pockets.

33:01.200 --> 33:01.520
Interesting.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.520
But the thing is, is the material, the way they fit, the way they look,

33:06.080 --> 33:08.640
these are what adult jeans are.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.680
This is adult jeans.

33:09.680 --> 33:13.120
I'm wearing adult- these are adult jeans, Griffin.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.280
These aren't my little boy jeans anymore.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.040
I still like my boy jeans though.

33:17.040 --> 33:20.080
They make me feel like I can go out in the yard and play around

33:20.080 --> 33:21.600
and I don't even worry about it.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.840
But boy jeans aren't an everyday jean, Griffin.

33:23.840 --> 33:28.240
Sometimes you have to go to like, I don't know, the store and you want to look like an adult

33:28.240 --> 33:30.720
and not have people like tell you where the candy aisle is.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.160
That's actually a great service that they can provide for me.

33:34.160 --> 33:34.400
Thank you.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.320
Sometimes that is actually a nice thing.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.160
My boy jeans have special candy pockets,

33:38.160 --> 33:40.800
so this is actually a perfect arrangement, what you just described.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.880
You know what, market for a pick-a-mix.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.000
What you should do-

33:44.000 --> 33:46.240
What you got to do then is you got to go to Trunk Club

33:46.240 --> 33:49.520
and you need to talk to your personal stylist at Trunk Club and say,

33:49.520 --> 33:53.840
I'm looking for a jean I can wear to the candy aisle of the grocery store

33:53.840 --> 33:57.520
and I guarantee you they will give you that perfect jean.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.440
Maybe it's got lollies already stuck to it.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.680
And they have-

34:01.680 --> 34:03.440
Some people know you're a sugar head.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.800
And big cargo pockets for putting all of your bridge mix.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.040
Yeah.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.200
Hey, Travis, I love you.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.640
That's theft, my dude.

34:10.640 --> 34:11.120
No, no, no.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.240
Once you buy it, Justin, then you just eat out of the pockets all day.

34:14.880 --> 34:15.600
Okay.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.440
Those are your all day snack pants.

34:18.160 --> 34:20.000
Oh, these are my candy pants.

34:20.000 --> 34:20.960
So here's what you're going to do.

34:20.960 --> 34:24.000
You're going to go to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.200
You're going to type in your measurements.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.280
You're going to share your likes, dislikes,

34:27.280 --> 34:29.840
and talk about the things that you need to close for.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.960
And Trunk Club is going to send you a trunk of clothing straight to your door.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.680
It's going to be handpicked by your very own personal stylist

34:36.400 --> 34:39.600
and you keep what you like and you send back what you don't

34:39.600 --> 34:41.360
and you only pay for what you keep.

34:41.360 --> 34:44.320
It's a great deal and they're going to send you amazing stuff.

34:44.320 --> 34:44.880
I've done it.

34:44.880 --> 34:45.680
Justin's done it.

34:46.560 --> 34:50.800
And you end up with amazing clothes that enter the rotation

34:50.800 --> 34:52.560
and it's your favorite stuff.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.800
And the best thing is it's not a subscription service.

34:54.800 --> 34:58.080
It's not something that you have to worry about being charged for every month.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.000
You only pay for it when you do it and you only do it when you need it.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.080
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and check it out.

35:06.080 --> 35:11.920
And if you're in Dallas, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, DC, or Charleston, South Carolina,

35:12.800 --> 35:18.080
you can go into one of their clubhouses and work with the stylist right there in person.

35:18.080 --> 35:23.200
Try on the clothes right there and have a very special clothing experience.

35:23.200 --> 35:28.480
Yeah, so go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and get on board.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.480
I want to tell you about Warby Parker.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.520
We are also sponsored in part this week by Warby Parker.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.280
It's a new concept in eyewear. You've probably heard of what they do.

35:37.840 --> 35:43.120
It's the best, it's just the best way to buy fashion forward, affordable glasses.

35:43.920 --> 35:48.480
You go online, you pick out, you pick out five pairs of glasses

35:48.480 --> 35:53.200
and they ship these frames to your home as part of the home try on program.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.200
These prescription glasses start at 95 bucks, including lenses,

35:58.080 --> 36:00.640
and you can get both glasses and sunglasses.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.000
So they send you five frames.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.920
You put them on, you see what works, see what doesn't.

36:03.920 --> 36:08.800
And then you get to keep the ones that you like.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.680
And it's really fast.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.200
It's, you get a prepaid package.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.240
It's easy to ship back to the ones that you don't want.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.840
And they have really slick looking sunglasses.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.240
Not only that, for every pair of sunglasses that are sold,

36:20.240 --> 36:22.400
they distribute a pair of glasses to someone in need.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.200
So it's a really, it's a really cool company.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.720
And again, you can get UV protected sunglasses starting at 95 bucks,

36:28.720 --> 36:32.640
or you can get those sunglasses with a prescription for 175 bucks

36:32.640 --> 36:35.120
as the minimum price there.

36:35.120 --> 36:39.600

36:40.160 --> 36:43.120

37:00.560 --> 37:02.560
Justin, did you laugh in the middle of that

37:02.560 --> 37:04.800
because you read on to our Jumbotrons?

37:05.760 --> 37:07.600
No, I don't ever read ahead.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.760
I just take it as it comes, you know?

37:09.760 --> 37:10.400
Okay.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.600
Play it as it lies.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.160
Because I was reading them and appreciating them immensely.

37:15.520 --> 37:20.240
First off, I just want to say all, we put Jumbotrons for 2017

37:20.240 --> 37:23.200
for my brother, my brother and me on sale.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.080
And they all sold out, I think the first day.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.840
So you're all incredible.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.040
Yeah, they're all sold out.

37:29.040 --> 37:32.240
So like, thank you so much for that.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.680
That's fantastic.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.080
So we don't deserve you as always.

37:36.800 --> 37:37.920
No new information there.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.680
This first message is for 30-year-old Lizzie

37:41.680 --> 37:44.240
and it's from 29-year-old Lizzie.

37:44.240 --> 37:44.880
So dope.

37:44.880 --> 37:48.400
It says, hey, Lizzie, it's me, past Lizzie.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.400
I know you're 30 and you're mourning the slow

37:50.400 --> 37:52.480
and honorable loss of youth, but it's okay.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.520
You're still kind of young.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.240
If you're a hobbit, you wouldn't have even come of age yet.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.520
In your 30th year, you'll graduate, get married.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.080
You'll up your max fund donation.

38:02.080 --> 38:02.960
Thank you.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.800
And you'll continue to be kick-ass.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.160
PS, I hate you, Ron.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.360
And congratulations to 30-year-old Lizzie.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.400
She's been kicking it that way since the first

38:12.400 --> 38:15.120
or second week of August, which is a little suspect

38:15.120 --> 38:16.240
if that's your birthday, Lizzie.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.840
I think you probably know when that falls.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.360
You could probably zero in.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.840
You could probably zero in a little bit more specifically, Liz.

38:21.840 --> 38:25.440
But maybe in the year 30, you'll be a little bit more punctual

38:25.440 --> 38:27.440
and you'll finally lock down when your birthday is.

38:27.440 --> 38:29.520
But happy birthday to you, Lizzie.

38:31.440 --> 38:32.880
Oh, you're going to do this next one?

38:32.880 --> 38:34.480
Well, you guys did both of the ads.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.080
Hell yeah, dude, let her rip.

38:36.080 --> 38:36.400
Yeah.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.200
Here it comes.

38:37.200 --> 38:41.040
I got a message for Dan Craig and it's from Kat Comfort.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.480
And the message is this.

38:42.480 --> 38:45.680
Dan O, super sorry I didn't stop in Chicago

38:45.680 --> 38:47.760
that last time I drove through Illinois.

38:47.760 --> 38:52.560
I was like right there and I just kept on trucking.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.120
My bad.

38:55.520 --> 38:58.320
But for realsies, thanks for being my very great pal

38:58.320 --> 38:59.600
for almost 20 years.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.720
Love, Katrinka.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.280
And that is very-

39:03.280 --> 39:04.160
I get it.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.480
You don't want to fuck with the Dan Ryan Expressway.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.080
You're trucking through Illinois.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.600
You're like, I'm going to make a pit stop in Chicago.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.480
That's a 14-hour trip with all the traffic on I-94.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.600
No thanks, I say.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.120
No, thank you.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.480
I mean, I'll go, I want a chili dog as much as the next guy.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.080
I'd love to get some of that deep dish,

39:20.640 --> 39:22.160
but no way, it's not worth it.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.120
They should have a deep dish place on the highway

39:25.120 --> 39:26.240
that you could just drive through.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.560
You should be able to roll your fucking window down

39:28.560 --> 39:30.000
on the Dan Ryan Expressway

39:30.000 --> 39:31.360
and they just launch one right through

39:31.360 --> 39:33.440
the old fucking passenger side.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.080
I'm Brian.

39:34.080 --> 39:34.800
And I'm Erin.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.560
And we host Throwing Shade,

39:36.560 --> 39:39.920
a political comedy podcast that's somehow horribly offensive

39:39.920 --> 39:41.520
and socially conscious.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.880
If you want to know what it sounds like

39:42.880 --> 39:44.800
if the news drinks straight vodka,

39:44.800 --> 39:46.720
check us out on Thursdays on MaxFun.

39:46.720 --> 39:50.080
And we're the first MaxFun podcast to be turned into a TV show,

39:50.080 --> 39:53.440
so check that out January 17th on TV Land.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.080
Throwing Shade.

39:54.720 --> 39:55.520
Politics.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.560
Pop culture.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.360
Wigs for days.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.680
Do you guys want to, or did we just do a Yahoo?

40:05.680 --> 40:07.120
I think it's time for a regular question.

40:07.120 --> 40:07.520
Yeah.

40:07.520 --> 40:08.400
Yeah, regular question.

40:08.400 --> 40:08.960
Here it come.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.160
Badging past security today,

40:12.160 --> 40:14.960
a security guard old lady commented,

40:14.960 --> 40:15.840
you always look sad.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.560
I had no response to this.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.400
I just shook my head and kept going.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.320
I'm not entirely sure I've ever been,

40:24.320 --> 40:25.360
seen this person before.

40:27.440 --> 40:30.000
Was there a better way I should have handled this?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.320
That's for just trying to get to my workplace in Tucson.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.000
Oh, man.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.360
The best way is just you're going,

40:35.360 --> 40:38.000
I'll have your job and keep walking.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.520
I have seen trailers.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.800
Have you guys seen these trailers

40:40.800 --> 40:44.480
for, I think it's a Will Smith movie

40:44.480 --> 40:48.240
and he gets visited by these ghosts,

40:48.240 --> 40:49.680
but one of them's like death

40:49.680 --> 40:50.800
and one of them is like love,

40:50.800 --> 40:52.320
one of them is like God or whatever.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.000
But one of them is in,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.200
I think it's called like collateral happiness

40:57.200 --> 40:58.000
or something like that.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.880
Some accidental joy.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.200
Maybe it's one of those situations

41:03.200 --> 41:05.600
where it's just sort of like an avatar

41:05.600 --> 41:11.120
of like a particular virtue or God or something like that.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.280
And it's just like, buck up.

41:14.160 --> 41:15.680
I actually, I'm going to take your example

41:15.680 --> 41:16.960
one step further, Griffin,

41:16.960 --> 41:20.080
and say that this person is that classic example

41:20.080 --> 41:22.320
of like in a movie preview

41:22.320 --> 41:24.320
where they have that one line

41:24.320 --> 41:26.320
that kind of conveys to the audience

41:26.320 --> 41:29.280
everything they need to know about that character.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.520
Where it's just like, you're always so stressed.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.200
When are you going to take time for you?

41:33.200 --> 41:34.240
Yeah, that's a good point, Jeff.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.920
Was this like exposition?

41:35.920 --> 41:37.600
Were you in the middle of exposition

41:37.600 --> 41:38.880
about your character for a movie

41:38.880 --> 41:40.640
that's being filmed about you in secret?

41:40.640 --> 41:44.640
I watched While You Were Sleeping last night,

41:44.640 --> 41:46.880
and I'm pretty sure this person was in the movie.

41:46.880 --> 41:47.680
Wait, hold on.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.280
Did you just do that ironically

41:49.280 --> 41:51.360
because you were not sleeping because of the baby?

41:51.360 --> 41:51.860
No.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.080
Yeah, I just wanted to watch something

41:54.080 --> 41:55.520
with sleeping in the title.

41:55.520 --> 41:59.520
Just to remember what it was like when you were sleeping.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.560
I watched that movie.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.520
Sleepless in Seattle?

42:01.520 --> 42:02.080
No, thank you.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.440
Got a belly full of sleep.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.480
Got a belly full of that.

42:04.480 --> 42:07.520
I would rather watch Peter Gallagher in a fucking coma.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.280
Push me on the train tracks, my love.

42:10.880 --> 42:11.360
Please.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.080
Wait, hold on.

42:12.080 --> 42:15.120
I don't think Sandra Bullock pushes Peter Gallagher

42:15.120 --> 42:17.520
onto the train tracks so she can pretend to be.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.200
I haven't seen it in a while,

42:19.200 --> 42:21.920
but I don't think she does it and goes, this will do it.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.360
You're probably one of the few people

42:23.360 --> 42:24.640
that ever watched that film

42:24.640 --> 42:27.680
and eye Peter Gallagher enviously in his coma bed.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.440
Like, oh God, that would be such a choice.

42:29.440 --> 42:30.000
So dope.

42:30.000 --> 42:30.960
Real nice.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.720
Just snoozing whatever you want, huh?

42:32.720 --> 42:34.320
Because he wakes up and he wakes up

42:34.320 --> 42:36.480
and Sandra Bullock's his fiancee.

42:36.480 --> 42:38.880
And in the movie, he's like, I don't know this.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.480
I don't remember any of this happening.

42:40.480 --> 42:42.400
I don't remember this being my life.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.320
But it's like, Peter Gallagher,

42:44.320 --> 42:46.480
you just got like a bunch of sleep

42:46.480 --> 42:49.840
and you woke up and you're married to Sandy.

42:53.760 --> 42:54.640
Good flick, though.

42:54.640 --> 42:55.440
Good flick, though.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.640
Peter Gallagher.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.280
She doesn't...

42:57.280 --> 42:59.440
We're supposed to be fucking rooting for Bill Pullman.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.520
What an A-level cast.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.040
No, thanks.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.400
Oh, she ended up with Bill Pullman.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.040
Everything's okay.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.800
She could have had Pete Gallagher.

43:06.800 --> 43:07.280
And she-

43:07.280 --> 43:08.080
No, okay, listen.

43:08.080 --> 43:09.600
But she didn't, Griffin.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.680
She didn't know Pete Gallagher.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.360
She got to know Bill Pullman.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.240
That's the whole point.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.520
She had this whole made up fantasy.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.200
She knew he had one nut.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.560
What else do you need?

43:18.560 --> 43:21.120
I haven't seen that movie in so long.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.960
Yeah, it gets wild.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.240
She pushes a man onto a fucking train track.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.160
She doesn't push him, Griffin.

43:28.160 --> 43:28.640
Yeah.

43:28.640 --> 43:34.720
And there's a few story beats that involve his nut.

43:35.760 --> 43:36.560
His one nut.

43:39.120 --> 43:42.240
His one nut actually resolves a conflict in the first act.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.080
This is not a joke.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.480
What was the question?

43:47.280 --> 43:48.400
Yeah, exactly.

43:50.400 --> 43:51.920
The old lady said you always look sad.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.800
Yeah, this stinks.

43:52.800 --> 43:57.120
I don't think this is a good thing to say to anybody.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.800
Hey, you always look sad.

43:58.800 --> 43:59.280
Cool.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.960
I don't know what to do with that information.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.080
This falls under the same, like,

44:04.080 --> 44:06.480
if anyone ever says to another human being,

44:06.480 --> 44:08.160
like, you should smile more.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.200
Like, this kind of, like,

44:09.200 --> 44:14.320
we all just need to stop commenting on the facial expressions made by other people.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.120
Because for all you know, that person is just really contemplative.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.080
Like, all the time.

44:18.640 --> 44:21.120
But also, more importantly, fuck you.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.480
Yeah, also that.

44:22.480 --> 44:26.480
Like, you don't get to dictate how anyone else should look, ever.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.560
That idea of, like, if I want to frown all the time,

44:28.560 --> 44:30.320
and, like, that's my deal.

44:30.320 --> 44:31.520
Like, go fuck yourself.

44:31.520 --> 44:32.480
Unless.

44:33.200 --> 44:33.760
Unless.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.800
The person's got touched by an angel.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.760
Oh, we're in a Roma Downey situation.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.560
You've never seen this security guard before.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.040
So either it's her first day,

44:45.040 --> 44:48.720
and you said she's an old, what, old lady.

44:50.240 --> 44:54.240
And if we take that, like, this is like an 85 year old woman.

44:54.240 --> 44:54.880
Angel.

44:54.880 --> 44:55.520
Angel, right?

44:55.520 --> 44:59.040
She's not starting a new career in security guard.

44:59.040 --> 44:59.600
You know what I mean?

44:59.600 --> 45:01.680
Like, put the fucking clues together.

45:01.680 --> 45:04.320
You gotta, if you want to, if you want to spot an angel,

45:05.360 --> 45:07.920
you gotta, you gotta follow the clues.

45:07.920 --> 45:08.880
Because they're wily.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.000
So all old people are angels.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.200
No, I'm saying, yes.

45:15.040 --> 45:17.120
If you see an old person and they're not at church,

45:17.920 --> 45:20.640
then they're, then they're probably an angel, ironically.

45:20.640 --> 45:25.520
You know, and while you were sleeping, there's a,

45:25.520 --> 45:27.280
there's another story beat where there is a,

45:27.280 --> 45:29.360
she gets into Peter Gallagher's nice apartment,

45:29.360 --> 45:31.840
and the doorman is an old man.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.520
And he's like, I don't know, I don't know you.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.400
Get the fuck out of here.

45:34.400 --> 45:36.560
And first of all, it's like, don't be mean to Sandra Bullock.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.440
But he, she's like, oh, I'm Peter Gallagher's fiancee.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.840
And the doorman is like, oh, sorry, I'm new.

45:43.840 --> 45:46.640
So like, now I'm starting to put the clues together.

45:46.640 --> 45:49.040
This is another old person starting a new career

45:49.040 --> 45:50.960
in the security industry.

45:50.960 --> 45:53.760
I'm thinking that the, I'm thinking we got to fucking email

45:53.760 --> 45:57.840
Stranger Than Fiction style from characters in the movies

45:57.840 --> 45:59.120
while you were sleeping.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.240
You think that we're getting emailed by the characters

46:02.240 --> 46:03.280
in the movie?

46:03.280 --> 46:06.720
Well, of all the podcasts, if you're gonna email one podcast,

46:06.720 --> 46:09.040
I definitely would go to ours if I was a character

46:09.040 --> 46:10.400
while you were sleeping.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.840
I would email our podcast.

46:11.840 --> 46:18.240
I really like Sleepy Griffin a lot.

46:18.240 --> 46:22.320
They're just scrolling through the iTunes charts.

46:22.320 --> 46:25.680
They go way past the 20s and they duck into the 30s

46:25.680 --> 46:27.600
and they're like, I think I found my one.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.280
They're like, what's Chris Hardwick?

46:29.280 --> 46:31.600
No, no, no.

46:31.600 --> 46:32.800
He's way too popular.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.680
No, no.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.440
Who are these assholes?

46:37.440 --> 46:39.440
My brother, my brother and me, you say.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.920
They'll free me from the celluloid prison.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.000
The description of their show sounds like the rabblings

46:44.000 --> 46:44.880
of a madman.

46:44.880 --> 46:47.520
I think I'm gonna just go ahead and email these brothers

46:47.520 --> 46:48.640
I've never heard of before.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.400
That's like a message.

46:52.080 --> 46:55.440
You would have better luck writing a note to Marc Maron

46:55.440 --> 46:59.600
and throwing it into the ocean of getting your message out there.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.280
It's such a random play.

47:01.280 --> 47:06.400
Listen, Peter Boyle, we lost him 10 years ago.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.000
His ghost is inside of While You Were Sleeping

47:10.000 --> 47:11.680
and it listens to podcasts and he's a big fan

47:11.680 --> 47:13.200
and he sent me an email last night.

47:13.200 --> 47:14.480
Read between the lines, Justin.

47:14.480 --> 47:17.520
Read between the fucking lines, Justin.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.920
So I think we all know that that's the situation.

47:19.920 --> 47:22.240
Let's move on to a good Yahoo.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.000
Or should we just do another question?

47:24.000 --> 47:25.360
We got a fucking good question.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.320
So many questions.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.120
Hey, brothers three.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.560
I went to a restaurant with my family today

47:28.560 --> 47:31.040
but didn't order anything because I was very hungry.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.720
The waiter seemed very concerned with this.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.200
He kept asking if I was sure if I wanted to keep my menu

47:35.200 --> 47:36.720
and order later and whatnot.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.320
I said, no, I'm fine with just water.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.520
As he checked up on us or getting ready to leave,

47:41.520 --> 47:45.440
he offered me a ginger ale to go to help me feel better.

47:45.440 --> 47:48.400
I'm not sick or anything, but I did accept the offer

47:48.400 --> 47:51.120
nodding and smiling as he wished for me to get better soon.

47:52.960 --> 47:53.840
Two questions.

47:53.840 --> 47:54.640
Am I good?

47:55.200 --> 47:58.320
And does my disheveled nature really look that pathetic?

47:58.320 --> 48:00.560
And that's from Pale and Mild in Portland, Maine.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.000
Okay, this is my shit.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.720
This is a perfect follow up to that last question

48:04.720 --> 48:06.480
because this person was like, are you okay?

48:06.480 --> 48:07.840
You look hung, you look sick.

48:07.840 --> 48:08.480
No, I'm fine.

48:08.480 --> 48:09.600
Are you sure you look sick?

48:09.600 --> 48:10.560
No, I'm telling you, I'm good.

48:10.560 --> 48:12.960
Okay, here's a thing I'm going to give you

48:12.960 --> 48:15.200
to fix this perceived problem.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.440
If this security guard had been like, you always look sad.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.440
Here's a pack of Pokemon cards.

48:19.440 --> 48:21.920
That would be a fucking horse of a different color entirely.

48:23.440 --> 48:25.520
I'm going to sell it to you for half a sticker price.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.720
There might be like a holofoil in there.

48:28.720 --> 48:29.680
You don't fucking know.

48:29.680 --> 48:31.040
Gut check, gut check.

48:34.320 --> 48:38.800
How does this waiter's activities or waiter?

48:38.800 --> 48:41.680
Yes, how do their activities treat you?

48:41.680 --> 48:42.960
Their decisions treat you?

48:42.960 --> 48:46.000
Because I think this is a nice little gesture.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.080
Well, there's, okay, I'll tell you this here,

48:48.080 --> 48:50.480
but it is either a nice little gesture

48:50.480 --> 48:55.520
or it is someone who sees a potential seat filler

48:55.520 --> 48:58.560
who's not spending money that they would get a tip from.

48:58.560 --> 49:00.320
Then why the ginger ale?

49:00.320 --> 49:02.880
Because they're trying to do something nice for the table

49:02.880 --> 49:06.480
to engender themselves with the table.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.200
So that people are like that waiter was so nice and conscientious

49:09.200 --> 49:09.920
and really cared about.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.200
I'm not saying that's bad.

49:11.200 --> 49:13.040
I'm saying this is a conscientious waiter

49:13.040 --> 49:15.520
who's trying to do right by the table.

49:15.520 --> 49:17.680
That's a really cynical way to look at this.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.600
Well, I've worked in a lot of restaurants.

49:20.400 --> 49:24.400
I have to say this, in terms of, are you good?

49:24.400 --> 49:27.120
Someone offered you a ginger ale and you took it.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.920
Listen, I've been alive for 36 years.

49:29.920 --> 49:34.320
I cannot count any, I cannot summon any moments

49:34.320 --> 49:35.200
where someone had been like,

49:35.200 --> 49:38.320
hey, do you want a tall, frosty ginger ale to go?

49:38.320 --> 49:41.280
I would have said, no, I don't think I do want that.

49:41.280 --> 49:43.920
Because I'd use, yeah, pretty much all the time.

49:43.920 --> 49:47.120
If I had a cold ginger ale right now to just enjoy at my leisure,

49:47.120 --> 49:49.120
that would go down so good.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.640
Okay, but can we take a side note too?

49:50.640 --> 49:52.160
Because Justin, you're 100% right.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.680
I cannot remember a time in my life

49:53.680 --> 49:56.080
in which I thought I needed a ginger ale

49:56.080 --> 49:57.600
until someone offered it to me,

49:57.600 --> 50:00.320
be it a flight attendant or a waiter.

50:00.320 --> 50:01.840
And only then did I realize,

50:01.840 --> 50:04.720
yes, exactly what I need in this moment

50:04.720 --> 50:06.400
is a ginger ale.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.160
And you can never find it when you need it.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.480
If you want a ginger ale, there's not gonna be any around.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.000
So you just gotta take it when it comes.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.600
Unless it's a can of the dry.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.040
And then you say, thank you for the glass.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.720
And you pick it up and you walk to the bathroom

50:16.720 --> 50:18.320
and you pour it in the toilet.

50:18.320 --> 50:19.840
You pour it in the toilet or the urinal

50:19.840 --> 50:21.040
or the sink or the garbage can.

50:21.040 --> 50:22.160
Just like get rid of it.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.320
Is this that Austin snobbery I've been hearing about?

50:24.320 --> 50:24.720
The Austin ginger ale snobbery?

50:24.720 --> 50:29.200
No, it's just like that shit doesn't taste like ginger at all.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.040
Are you a Seagrams or nothing?

50:31.040 --> 50:36.000
Seagrams or Verner's is good shit.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Verner's is a little too sharp for me.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.120
I want it splicey.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.080
Give me that splice.

50:40.080 --> 50:40.560
It's a splice.

50:40.560 --> 50:41.680
A little too much splice for me.

50:41.680 --> 50:42.080
I want that.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.440
That ginger is a splice.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.720
Canada is the only one where I can find it in diet.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.600
And I'm drinking it every single night with Brandy.

50:49.600 --> 50:51.280
So I need diet.

50:51.280 --> 50:53.200
I don't need the extra K-Cals.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.680
I'm actually right now having a ginger beer

50:55.680 --> 50:57.040
and whiskey and bourbon.

50:57.040 --> 51:00.400
And ginger beer might be what I've been craving all these years,

51:00.400 --> 51:02.160
but I've been having a ginger ale,

51:02.160 --> 51:03.440
which now I say it out loud.

51:03.440 --> 51:06.160
Is a ginger ale a form of ginger beer?

51:06.160 --> 51:06.640
Discuss.

51:07.920 --> 51:09.440
Is there a ginger lager?

51:09.440 --> 51:10.160
No, this is bad.

51:10.160 --> 51:10.880
First of all, no.

51:10.880 --> 51:12.400
And second of all, I don't want to discuss.

51:12.400 --> 51:13.440
This is dead air.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.240
This is dead air.

51:14.240 --> 51:16.240
That angel is listening right now

51:16.240 --> 51:18.160
and she's just like, I've made a huge mistake.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.800
Peter Boyle is like, unsubscribe.

51:20.800 --> 51:23.600
I'm gonna go get a fucking deep dish pizza.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.080
I don't care if they read my shit or not.

51:26.080 --> 51:27.360
I hate this.

51:27.360 --> 51:31.360
Do you guys have another question?

51:31.360 --> 51:33.680
Peter Boyle's role in that movie, by the way,

51:33.680 --> 51:36.640
is I think he's like a grandpa of Peter Gallagher.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.280
And he fucking knows.

51:39.280 --> 51:41.840
Like he knows the secret that they're not really engaged.

51:41.840 --> 51:44.400
And he lets it go so far.

51:45.040 --> 51:46.960
They like are about to get married

51:46.960 --> 51:48.160
and Peter Boyle's like sitting there

51:48.160 --> 51:49.280
knowing this dark secret.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.200
It's like, say something, Peter.

51:51.200 --> 51:51.920
And he doesn't.

51:52.480 --> 51:54.400
Because he loves those young lovers, Griffin.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.360
He just likes seeing the young lovers.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.160
Oh, you tried to sneak it in there, huh?

51:58.160 --> 51:59.920
Young lovers getting married.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.160
I have a good Yahoo and I'd like to do it.

52:02.960 --> 52:03.280
Okay.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.160
It's from Nicholas Potter sent this one in.

52:06.160 --> 52:06.880
Thank you, Nicholas.

52:06.880 --> 52:10.640
It's an anonymous user, but we're gonna call him Peter Boyle.

52:10.640 --> 52:11.280
What's up, buddy?

52:12.320 --> 52:14.000
Thanks for listening.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.960
Were podcasts around in 2006?

52:16.960 --> 52:17.600
They were, okay.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.720
This Peter Boyle asks,

52:20.720 --> 52:26.640
how dangerous would I be in a fight just for the fun of it?

52:26.640 --> 52:28.640
How dangerous do you think I would be?

52:28.640 --> 52:29.680
Here are some tips.

52:29.680 --> 52:31.600
I'm gonna get a big drink of water

52:31.600 --> 52:33.360
because this is gonna be a lot.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.280
Here are some tips.

52:35.280 --> 52:38.480
Some stats.

52:39.200 --> 52:42.480
Okay, so let's divide this in some factors first.

52:42.480 --> 52:45.840
Speed, stregt, and strategy.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.280
I think stregt is strength.

52:49.280 --> 52:50.800
Stregt is strength?

52:50.800 --> 52:51.920
Yes, okay.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.920
Okay, so I'm very fast and I'm good on reflexes.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.120
As for my stregt,

52:57.120 --> 53:00.320
I can do 50 push-ups without doing workout for a while.

53:00.320 --> 53:04.240
When I used to work out, I was able to do 80, even a 100 once.

53:04.240 --> 53:06.240
And as for my strategy,

53:06.240 --> 53:08.240
in fighting, the objective is simple.

53:08.240 --> 53:09.760
Put the enemy on the floor.

53:09.760 --> 53:11.760
To me, there are no rules in fighting

53:11.760 --> 53:13.680
unless it is an official fight like boxing.

53:13.680 --> 53:18.720
But if it's not, then I ain't got no rules.

53:18.720 --> 53:23.520
I'll try to get a hot the opponent furs like,

53:23.520 --> 53:26.640
let him throw first punch,

53:26.640 --> 53:29.920
duck, punch him in the gut at max stregt,

53:29.920 --> 53:31.440
and then get right next to him

53:31.440 --> 53:33.120
and kick on the side of his leg,

53:33.120 --> 53:35.520
breaking or deslocating his knee.

53:35.520 --> 53:37.440
Then it's a punch on the back of the head

53:37.440 --> 53:39.840
and even kicking to the ground if needed.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.640
And last but not least, kicking in the ribs.

53:42.640 --> 53:45.200
Of course, there are so many ways this could go wrong,

53:45.200 --> 53:46.080
but it's an example.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.440
I rarely have been in fights,

53:51.120 --> 53:53.280
but I have tough a lot about it,

53:53.280 --> 53:55.920
and so I somehow mentalized for it.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.480
Of course, I will still be nervous,

53:58.480 --> 54:01.680
but if I decide not to hesitate, then I won't.

54:01.680 --> 54:05.760
So yeah, pretty much is as soon as I manage to buy myself some time

54:05.760 --> 54:07.200
after giving a hit,

54:07.200 --> 54:10.800
it'll aim for the weak spots and make my opponent fall to the ground.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.600
That was like a sidebar in between.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.120
So anyway, where was I?

54:16.880 --> 54:19.200
Pretty much as soon as I managed to buy myself some time

54:19.200 --> 54:19.840
after getting a hit,

54:19.840 --> 54:22.400
I'll aim for the weak spots and try to make my opponent

54:22.400 --> 54:23.600
fall to the ground and beat them up.

54:23.600 --> 54:26.480
As for weapons, that's for another question.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.200
So what do you think?

54:28.000 --> 54:28.400
Update.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.000
Oh, I forgot to mention.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.680
My abs are really hard.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.720
So if enforcing them, I can take a punch to them.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.840
It's like having armor.

54:39.200 --> 54:39.920
Really not.

54:39.920 --> 54:43.120
It's really not unless it's like so good.

54:43.120 --> 54:45.600
Your abs are so good against like knives.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.200
Like they're that hard.

54:47.920 --> 54:50.560
I want to watch a video.

54:50.560 --> 54:51.120
No, don't.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.800
I don't want to watch some fight video.

54:52.800 --> 54:55.680
Of this person and this specific person, though,

54:55.680 --> 55:00.160
like walking up to a fight once they've gotten over their hesitation of worry.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.680
I wish them the best.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.040
Like I wish them the best.

55:03.040 --> 55:03.600
Go with God.

55:03.600 --> 55:04.960
No, go with God.

55:04.960 --> 55:05.520
Stand your truth.

55:05.520 --> 55:06.720
I don't want to watch this person fight.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.400
I don't want to watch two people fight

55:08.400 --> 55:10.240
as much as like everybody on Facebook is like,

55:10.240 --> 55:11.520
watch these two people fight.

55:12.080 --> 55:14.160
I'm like, no, I don't want to see two people fight.

55:14.160 --> 55:15.040
Griffin, hear me out.

55:15.040 --> 55:15.920
Hear me out.

55:15.920 --> 55:19.200
There is a specific line in this that makes me want to watch it.

55:19.920 --> 55:21.520
And that is when they say,

55:21.520 --> 55:24.480
when they throw a punch, I'll duck.

55:24.480 --> 55:25.040
Yeah.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.160
Well, that's the first step.

55:26.160 --> 55:27.120
That line.

55:27.120 --> 55:29.280
That's like a really amazing like,

55:29.280 --> 55:31.280
oh, no, I have a plan for punches.

55:33.520 --> 55:34.400
I know what you're thinking.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.760
What if they punch you?

55:35.760 --> 55:37.360
Well, let me stop you there

55:37.360 --> 55:41.280
because I have a strategy for if they punch me,

55:41.280 --> 55:43.200
I just won't let them.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.640
My head won't be there.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.080
They'll see my head there,

55:46.080 --> 55:47.520
but then a split second later,

55:47.520 --> 55:49.200
my head will be down.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.640
How can you punch what you can't see?

55:53.440 --> 55:54.240
Oh, punches?

55:54.800 --> 55:56.080
No, not an ish.

55:56.080 --> 55:56.560
How can you punch-

55:56.560 --> 55:59.440
I don't know how people keep losing fights, honestly.

55:59.440 --> 56:00.800
Just don't let them.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.400
Just don't let them punch you.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.840
Just don't let them punch you.

56:03.840 --> 56:06.000
This guy was watching boxing matches just like,

56:06.000 --> 56:07.680
what are you doing?

56:07.680 --> 56:10.320
No, your head was up and she'd be down.

56:10.320 --> 56:12.720
I don't want this guy to get into a fight.

56:12.720 --> 56:16.480
I just want him to be in the sidelines

56:16.480 --> 56:17.680
in a new Rocky movie.

56:17.680 --> 56:19.520
I want him to be ringside.

56:19.520 --> 56:20.560
I rock.

56:20.560 --> 56:21.360
He putt.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.240
You gotta move.

56:22.800 --> 56:25.280
Listen, listen, if he's going for a punch,

56:25.280 --> 56:26.960
you gotta move that noggin, my man.

56:27.920 --> 56:30.160
Down, no down.

56:30.160 --> 56:32.080
If he gets enough of those punches in,

56:32.080 --> 56:33.760
you're gonna lose the boxing fight.

56:33.760 --> 56:35.280
No, flex your abs.

56:35.280 --> 56:36.240
Flex them.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.680
The other coach is like,

56:37.680 --> 56:39.280
ah, shit, that's a great idea.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.600
Hey, Derek, don't let him,

56:42.160 --> 56:43.120
don't let him do it.

56:44.320 --> 56:45.280
Don't let him do it.

56:45.280 --> 56:46.400
Just move her out.

56:46.400 --> 56:46.720
Yes.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.440
And this boxing was in there forever.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.680
Just when you see a punch coming,

56:51.680 --> 56:54.800
don't be there to receive it.

56:54.800 --> 56:55.760
Well, where should I be?

56:57.520 --> 56:59.840
Just left or right or down or up.

56:59.840 --> 57:00.640
Jump over the-

57:00.640 --> 57:01.760
Here's my strategy.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.360
I jump over all the punches.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.280
Like Mario.

57:05.280 --> 57:06.400
Like Mario does.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.800
I'm one of the Mario brothers.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.880
I'm one of the Super Mario brothers.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.800
I'm Wah Derek.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.160
And I jump over your punches.

57:14.160 --> 57:15.760
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

57:15.760 --> 57:16.880
Ba na na na na.

57:16.880 --> 57:17.600
Nice try.

57:18.880 --> 57:22.240
Isn't it a shame that if you were Mario

57:22.240 --> 57:25.360
and you wanted to apply your skills in the boxing ring,

57:25.360 --> 57:28.080
that it would work exactly once

57:28.080 --> 57:30.320
and then no one would ever box you again?

57:30.320 --> 57:30.640
Yeah.

57:30.640 --> 57:33.440
Because like you jump on somebody's head

57:33.440 --> 57:35.440
and it does work and it's amazing.

57:35.440 --> 57:36.480
And the refs are like,

57:36.480 --> 57:38.560
we don't have a rule against it.

57:38.560 --> 57:39.040
And you're like,

57:39.040 --> 57:41.600
well, I guess I'm in for a new career of boxing.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.680
No more squishing mushrooms for me.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.280
But then you try to find another opponent.

57:45.280 --> 57:47.760
They're like, no, I've pretty much got your number.

57:48.720 --> 57:50.400
You want to jump on my head.

57:50.400 --> 57:52.640
So I'd really rather fight anybody else honestly.

57:52.640 --> 57:53.600
That's actually, Justin,

57:53.600 --> 57:56.560
why he had to resort to just being a boxing referee.

57:57.760 --> 57:58.400
True.

57:58.400 --> 57:58.640
Yeah.

57:58.640 --> 58:02.080
That's how that career change worked out.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.240
That's how it happened.

58:04.240 --> 58:06.560
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

58:06.560 --> 58:07.840
My Brother, My Brother and Me.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.440
A few things we want to hit on real quick.

58:09.440 --> 58:12.480
The first is it's that time of year again.

58:12.480 --> 58:14.720
It's time for the My Brother, My Brother and Me Angels.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.960
If you've listened to our show before

58:16.960 --> 58:19.120
in previous Candlelight seasons,

58:19.120 --> 58:19.920
you know how this works.

58:19.920 --> 58:22.160
But let me give you the 30 second elevator pitch.

58:22.160 --> 58:24.320
We come from an area called Huntington West Virginia.

58:24.320 --> 58:27.280
And in our region, there's a lot of poverty.

58:27.280 --> 58:30.800
And there are people for whom the holidays

58:30.800 --> 58:32.160
are not going to be so happy.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.320
So our local paper, The Hairless Batch,

58:34.320 --> 58:37.200
puts together a list of people with needs

58:37.200 --> 58:38.000
throughout our area.

58:38.560 --> 58:41.520
A lot of them children, a lot of them adults with disabilities,

58:43.200 --> 58:44.480
elderly folks, whatever.

58:45.040 --> 58:47.200
People who aren't going to have a Christmas otherwise

58:47.200 --> 58:49.520
and ask for some small items that they need.

58:49.520 --> 58:52.400
Toys for some of the kids or clothes

58:52.400 --> 58:55.120
for people who are trying to get work, that kind of thing.

58:55.120 --> 58:57.280
Can I give just a quick example of a couple

58:57.280 --> 58:58.400
of the items, Juice?

58:58.400 --> 58:59.280
Sure, yeah.

58:59.280 --> 59:02.160
For example, people asking for help with bus passes.

59:02.880 --> 59:05.360
People asking for help with winter coats

59:05.360 --> 59:07.040
and pots and pans.

59:07.040 --> 59:10.880
These aren't frivolous wish list items.

59:10.880 --> 59:12.800
These are things that people just need a little help with

59:13.680 --> 59:15.920
to be able to get by and provide for their families

59:15.920 --> 59:17.440
and take care of themselves.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.760
So if you want to help people in our area,

59:19.760 --> 59:21.280
and it means so much to us,

59:21.280 --> 59:27.920
we have a website now built by some kind listeners

59:29.200 --> 59:34.720
that is really helping to make this process

59:34.720 --> 59:36.400
a lot more manageable, I think.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.360
So thanks to Jeremy and Willem and everybody

59:41.360 --> 59:43.360
who has helped out with this project.

59:44.080 --> 59:48.240
It's mbambangels.com is the website.

59:48.240 --> 59:49.280
And here's how it works.

59:49.280 --> 59:51.520
You go to mbambangels, you find somebody

59:51.520 --> 59:52.480
that you want to help.

59:52.480 --> 59:54.960
You call the organization to see

59:54.960 --> 59:57.760
if your item is still unclaimed

59:57.760 --> 59:59.280
because there are folks in our area

59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.240
that also see this list.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.920
So you want to make sure you're not double dipping.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.240
And if you don't like calling,

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.280
if you're uncomfortable with that,

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.400
there are people on our Facebook group

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.040
that'll do it for you.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.840
If you just ask, you go there, you claim somebody,

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.680
you buy the thing, you can buy it on Amazon,

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.840
just have it shipped to wherever they're at

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.000
and you mark them as completed and that's done.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.600
We've had 64% of these gifts, these stockings be filled.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.120
And that's amazing, but we really want

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.160
to try to get everybody.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.960
So if you have a little time and some extra cash,

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.360
oh, by the way, you can also just donate money.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.400
There's some bigger ticket items

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.080
that people are sort of chipping in on together.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.160
You can do that too, the details are on the website.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.160
But if you can do that, it will make you feel great

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.880
and it really does mean a lot to people.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.680
So that website again is mbambangels.com.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.120
So please, if you can, go help out, it means a lot.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.880
I also want to say there's another opportunity

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.800
for giving this holiday season,

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.320
if you're looking for other ways to help out.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.440
Patrick Rothfuss, who is a friend of the show,

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.800
he's been on an episode before

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.200
and it's also just like super cool dude.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:05.680
Good dude.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.400
He started a charity called World Builders

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.680
that's spearheaded by a bunch of awesome authors

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.080
and it supports Heifer International,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.680
Mercy Corps and First Book.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.440
Basically a lot of stuff to help out like kids,

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.760
kids who need food, kids who need water,

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.760
kids who need help learning.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.480
And what you do is you go and for every $10 you donate,

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.880
you get entered into a lottery to win cool stuff.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.280
So it's mutually beneficial

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.640
and you get to do a little bit of good.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.320
And right now we have our own fundraising team.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.200
You can go join team Mbimbambino,

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.960
just go to bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M-W-B

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.320
and maybe consider giving like 10 bucks and helping out.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.880
I want to beat all the other fucking teams.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.480
I do want to do that too, yeah.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.720
I want to grind them down into the dirt

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.320
and make them ashamed.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.600
Yeah, I want them to be embarrassed

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.280
they ever wanted to help anybody.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.480
Yeah, that'll teach them.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.960
Take that you philanthropic assholes.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.040
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:07.840
for the use of our theme song

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.880
it's a departure off the album,

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.760
Putting the Days to Bed.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.000
It's a wonderful album that you should go get

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.720
and buy it as a holiday present for yourself

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.240
or your kin and your friends or whatever.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.440
Also want to thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.960
It's a really, really great network,

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.400
something we're really enthusiastic about.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.160
All the shows on it are super great.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.720
You can find them all at MaximumFun.org

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.480
or if you want to listen to other podcasts with us

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.000
or videos with us, go to McElroyShows.com

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.000
and you can find all our projects there.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.240
I also want to say two more things.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.640
One, our candlelight episode is coming up.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.120
We actually already recorded our candlelight live show

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.320
but because that's attached to the TV show

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.760
you won't be able to hear that for a while.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.200
So we'll still record.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.040
Yeah, we'll still record a candlelight episode

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.240
so that you have something to listen to.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.480
All beans, all beans though.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.640
All beans, but we need your candlelight questions.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.080
So make sure when you mail those in

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.680
put candle nights in the subject line

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.760
so it's easy for us to like group those all together.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.240
Also, we have a Facebook group

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.520
which we haven't mentioned in a while

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.040
and I think last time I checked

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.680
we had over 20,000 members in that Facebook group.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.440
Jesus. Which is humbling.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.480
So we have added some new moderators

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.560
to the Facebook group to kind of help manage that.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.480
So I wanted to just say a special thank you

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.600
to Rachel, Wesley, Stormy, Lucy, and Anthony

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.760
for taking on roles as moderators of the group

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.520
so that we don't end up with literally 1300 people

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.000
waiting to be led into the group.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.320
So thank you for helping out as moderators.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.520
We done?

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.200
You know, I want that final.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.240
That's gonna do it.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.440
All right, this final Yahoo was sent in by Shannon Cowell.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.480
Thank you, Shannon.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.120
It's by Yahoo answer user Jake McAwful who asks...

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.000
Is a shrimp a baby lobster?

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.880
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.560
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.840
This has been My Brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:08.800
Square on the lips.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.200
Are you in need of a shake up?

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.280
Max Fun Con is our annual comedy and creativity festival

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.520
and it changes lives.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.720
