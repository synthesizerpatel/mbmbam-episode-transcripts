00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.680
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the

00:47.680 --> 00:51.920
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother,

00:51.920 --> 00:57.120
Travis McElroy. Thank you all for joining us. I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30

00:57.120 --> 01:01.200
media luminary, Griffin McElroy. Griffin, you brought us here to-

01:01.200 --> 01:05.520
I want to thank you all for joining me here. I want to thank the press. I want to thank my-

01:06.400 --> 01:09.840
We never use the press room here at My Brother, My Brother and Me HQ.

01:09.840 --> 01:16.080
We've had one for years. This is our first proper press conference. I'm so glad that my family is

01:16.080 --> 01:20.240
supporting me through this difficult time as I make these trying announcements to you.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.880
And I ask for your patience, I ask for God. I ask for God's bliss and-

01:24.880 --> 01:28.800
You ask for God? Just like give him to you? This is a press conference and I don't think

01:28.800 --> 01:32.880
there's so much of a back and forth at the press conference until we get to the proper Q&A segment.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.000
I was gonna say I'm pretty sure that's what a press conference is, but go on.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.240
Well, okay. It's not so much a conversation. It's me talking about- I need God's help on this one

01:40.240 --> 01:44.400
and my family. I love them and they love me and support me through this announcement that I have

01:44.400 --> 01:55.200
to make these trying times is that I have decided today I think I'm just probably not going to end

01:55.200 --> 02:01.360
up taking- have taken a shower. I think- I think by the clock will roll over and it's going to be

02:01.360 --> 02:07.600
October 9th and on October 8th when I look back in my diary and I have the usual section in the diary

02:09.120 --> 02:14.240
it says shower time. That won't exist. There won't be an entry for that and it's a difficult

02:14.240 --> 02:19.520
decision that I've made and it's 7- it's 7 30 central time right now while we're recording this

02:19.520 --> 02:24.480
and I could- I could ostensibly take one after the recording but then a night shower just doesn't

02:24.480 --> 02:27.760
make any sense in my life right now. And have there been times today where I could have taken

02:27.760 --> 02:33.120
a shower instead of playing Star of the Valley? The answer to that is of course yes, but it's just-

02:33.120 --> 02:35.360
Are you ready to open it up to questions please?

02:35.360 --> 02:38.560
I want to thank my family and God one more time because I think that's important because I'll

02:38.560 --> 02:45.120
need both their help to get through this one I think and I- I- it's just- I've just- I- it's-

02:45.120 --> 02:47.840
and it's not like I've been sitting around all day. I've been out in the hot sun. There's been

02:47.840 --> 02:51.600
a little bit of sweat. I did go to the farmers market. I did go to an open house. There is a-

02:51.600 --> 02:57.840
there's this- there's a- an aroma but I- it's just today's a stink boy day. No showers today for me

02:57.840 --> 03:00.800
and thanks to God and family. Travis you- I believe you had a question. We'll open up the Q&A now.

03:00.800 --> 03:06.000
I do have a question. Well first I want to say thank you so much for having us.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.600
Well thank you and God.

03:07.600 --> 03:15.680
And God and family and I also want to say it- it feels weird to go first episode to

03:15.680 --> 03:19.200
375 episodes and still talking about your showering habits.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.040
Or lack thereof. I hate to interrupt.

03:23.040 --> 03:23.520
Yes thank you.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.840
So here's my question. Do you normally shower every day?

03:27.840 --> 03:35.120
That's an excellent question Travis. Yes I do. I honor my body with the wet room is what I call

03:35.120 --> 03:40.160
it sometimes. The small- or the small wet room and I'll get in there and lather up with my soaps and

03:40.160 --> 03:44.960
my oils and I do try to get clean every single day Travis because-

03:44.960 --> 03:45.600
Every day.

03:46.400 --> 03:51.680
Yeah I think it's- it's just a nice little bookend to either the morning or the afternoon as the case

03:51.680 --> 03:55.680
may be. Probably not the evening because it is evening time and I will not be taking a shower

03:55.680 --> 04:02.720
after the recording but yeah I do- I do typically try to keep my- my situation squeaky as- as- as

04:02.720 --> 04:06.640
the case may be. Thank you very much for your question and God. Anybody else?

04:07.840 --> 04:08.560
Excuse me Griffin.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.840
Yeah Justin McElroy please.

04:11.040 --> 04:15.040
Are you reaching this decision just now or did you have a moment where you were like I should

04:15.040 --> 04:19.040
get in the shower and didn't? Did you cross a barrier at some point from which there was no

04:19.040 --> 04:19.360
return?

04:19.920 --> 04:26.160
So there was a moment yes Rachel took the baby and they did go to Target to shop for various sundries

04:26.160 --> 04:31.440
and I did- I did stay home and I had the thought in my mind this would be a good opportunity for

04:31.440 --> 04:39.280
me to go get in the small wet room uninterrupted by baby cries or any- any sort of other situation

04:39.280 --> 04:46.080
that may need and so I made the decision in that moment that I was instead going to- I had a crop-

04:46.080 --> 04:49.920
a big crop of cranberries come in on Stardew Valley and so I did decide that I'm just going

04:49.920 --> 04:54.880
to sort of plop right down on the couch and I- I had the thought in my mind this is a lie

04:55.840 --> 04:59.840
but I had the thought in my mind is I'll- I'll harvest these cranberries go sell them maybe pop

04:59.840 --> 05:05.440
in the mine for a second give some gifts to my you know my beloveds and then I'll go get in the

05:05.440 --> 05:11.280
shower but then I saw the- the Honda drive back into the part- into the driveway and I knew like

05:11.280 --> 05:16.400
that that was never going to be a part of the plan and so I do want to apologize to my family

05:17.200 --> 05:20.080
and the lord for that one because I knew-

05:20.960 --> 05:28.320
I'm getting some reports that when your wife did return in the Honda the- upon entering the house

05:28.320 --> 05:34.400
she said the stink is still here you swore it was- excuse me this is my question sorry I'm

05:34.400 --> 05:40.400
reading this quote verbatim this quote is from God this quote God handed me this quote from your

05:40.400 --> 05:46.240
bride and it says the stink the stink is still here you swore you would not be the stink man upon

05:46.240 --> 05:53.680
my return and yet here the stink lies surrounding you like a tapestry lies and stink both drape you

05:53.680 --> 06:00.160
like a uh it says here a dirty rug yeah I'm not sure that must be a little bit of um

06:00.960 --> 06:07.760
illustrative sort of language and it hurt but it did hurt it hurt it hurt but I knew that the hurt

06:07.760 --> 06:13.760
was my own and that I caused it and I forced it to happen I- I knew the moment she did walk in

06:13.760 --> 06:20.400
and um her and the child the baby both looked at the gym shorts I had been wearing all day and sort

06:20.400 --> 06:27.440
of looked upon them with disgust and I knew in that moment that uh mistakes had been made mistakes

06:27.440 --> 06:31.120
have been made we can't go out there and perform 100 every single time sometimes Stardew Valley

06:31.120 --> 06:38.960
just came out and I'm want to get my cranberries going um so another question sorry one question

06:38.960 --> 06:43.600
over here over here let's get the let's get the follow-up from Justin and then we'll hop on over

06:43.600 --> 06:48.080
to Travis and Justin are you uh at this point are you able to play Stardew Valley without a guide

06:48.080 --> 06:52.000
because that kind of put me off when I was playing it the first time I mean I always felt like I was

06:52.000 --> 06:56.640
yeah I know all the crop rotations and everything thank you I know the profit ladders and uh the

06:56.640 --> 07:01.840
statistics and uh thank you very much I and it is because of that dedication to my craft that

07:01.840 --> 07:05.440
kept me from the wet room Travis go ahead with your question please uh thank you very much

07:05.440 --> 07:11.920
Travis McElroy Godtimes um just a quick question are you worried that this breaking of your small

07:11.920 --> 07:19.680
wet room pattern will lead to further not using the small wet room in the future well and I'm so

07:19.680 --> 07:23.120
glad that you've asked this Travis because I'm looking at my calendar tomorrow is Columbus Day

07:23.120 --> 07:28.880
which is traditionally stink boy holiday where all the stink boys gather and celebrate not having

07:28.880 --> 07:33.040
taken a shower that day now the thought of going two days in a row I would I think I would need to

07:33.040 --> 07:37.280
consult a physician at that point because who knows what sort of bacterium have climbed up

07:37.280 --> 07:44.880
into me just because I have stayed out of the wet room that they hate so bad but um I don't I don't

07:44.880 --> 07:50.880
love the way I feel right now I will be completely honest I don't love the way I feel um but follow

07:50.880 --> 07:56.160
up follow up sorry follow up question to that point sir then why not take a fucking shower

07:56.160 --> 08:04.800
oh sorry I've been doing this press conference so long that my tongue got real dry um it's the it's

08:04.800 --> 08:08.960
the it's it's the principle of the thing and I don't ask you to

08:10.080 --> 08:17.200
understand or respect my decisions but I do expect you to respect them okay family and God uh uh

08:18.800 --> 08:24.480
unrelated uh this weekend I was at Disney World and I saw an old man walking around

08:24.480 --> 08:28.880
without shoes or socks and I just wanted you guys okay so I need you to I need why

08:28.880 --> 08:33.760
don't you come up here why don't you come up here and we'll switch okay all right everybody

08:33.760 --> 08:40.320
I thank you all the thank God thank family it's Justin McElroy uh I was at Epcot uh I think I was

08:40.320 --> 08:49.200
near Norway and I saw an old man walking around um and he didn't have shoes on or socks and he

08:49.200 --> 08:56.560
didn't seem shameful uh and he had a t-shirt on I think it was a big dog t-shirt and khaki shorts

08:56.560 --> 09:01.600
and he had no socks or shoes at Disney World that's not what Walt wanted and that's not what

09:01.600 --> 09:08.400
Mickey wants and I'm pretty sure about that um Walt envisioned his uh experimental prototype

09:08.400 --> 09:14.000
City of Tomorrow I don't think or Epcot I don't think that he envisioned old men walking around

09:14.000 --> 09:18.800
without shoes or socks now uh sorry Justin Justin quick question here from Griffin McElroy from

09:18.800 --> 09:24.720
Disney yeah Griffin go ahead from Disney Adventures um it was did you follow this gentleman just to

09:24.720 --> 09:30.800
make sure that he was removed from the park by a big burly security guard who was dressed up

09:30.800 --> 09:39.600
like Pete from the Goofiverse yeah Pete came in and had a like comical handcuffs that were still

09:39.600 --> 09:46.960
very much real and he was escorted into uh uh Spaceship Earth where I assume he will be kept

09:46.960 --> 09:52.400
until his death um may I may I press conference status real quick you don't have a question

09:52.400 --> 09:57.760
about the Disney or I don't okay well so you guys go ahead and I repeat he was an old man without

09:57.760 --> 10:01.360
socks or shoes I can't believe you don't have anything for that I'm saying it no it's just

10:01.360 --> 10:12.160
very well okay uh run it back okay Travis McElroy uh Goofy Goofy um no paper just Goofy um are you

10:12.160 --> 10:16.640
sure that he was gets the news and he takes it back to Goofy and he tells it to Goofy one-on-one

10:16.640 --> 10:24.080
and he has to talk real slow is it possible that this old shoeless man was some sort of new

10:24.080 --> 10:29.440
character or cast member that you weren't aware of are you up to date on all of your Disney movies

10:30.160 --> 10:36.960

thank you uh hello thank you very much I'm Travis McElroy you gotta thank God thank God and thank

10:47.840 --> 10:53.040
you I want to uh thank God for giving me a ride here I'm predicting he doesn't have anything I

10:53.040 --> 10:56.160
think this is just because he won a press conference no no I do Justin didn't thank God

10:56.160 --> 11:04.480
and his family so his didn't count um I I have to apologize uh to everyone it is with shame

11:04.480 --> 11:12.160
that I announce I took two showers today and I'm worried that cosmically I took Griffin's away from

11:12.160 --> 11:18.160
him it's entirely possible it would explain my it would explain my I Griffin McElroy shower boy

11:18.160 --> 11:24.720
time uh express I was I was at a hotel this morning and they didn't have hot water but I

11:24.720 --> 11:28.800
needed to wash my hair so I'm just gonna set my head under it was horrible so when I got home

11:28.800 --> 11:33.600
to my real home where there was hot water I took a second shower and even as I did it I thought

11:33.600 --> 11:38.160
wow I'm enjoying this in a way that only Griffin McElroy normally enjoys his showers

11:38.960 --> 11:45.200
and I can I be honest I luxuriated in it I did shampoo conditioner and body wash the trifecta

11:45.200 --> 11:49.520
that you only do when you know you've got time uh and it was great it was amazing

11:49.520 --> 11:54.320
Griffin McElroy shower boy express I just am curious about how you plan on repaying this

11:54.320 --> 11:57.120
to me are we going to set up some sort of schedule where perhaps

11:58.080 --> 12:02.560
I get to take two showers one day and you don't get to take any or what's what's the sort of way

12:02.560 --> 12:07.280
to make this right with thank you so much for asking I would much rather do kind of an installment

12:07.280 --> 12:12.640
plan where each of my showers for like two weeks is one minute shorter um and each of yours is one

12:12.640 --> 12:18.320
minute longer maybe you don't get to use soap in one right exactly thank you um rather than just

12:18.320 --> 12:26.800
skipping the whole thank you and god thanks god here's uh so this is an advice show uh uh and

12:26.800 --> 12:32.480
here's the first question recently my husband and I bought our first house together congratulations

12:33.120 --> 12:37.840
soon after we bought our house we met our next door neighbor whose name we will say is Rory

12:37.840 --> 12:43.200
because that's hard to say can I all right I'll just go with that you can say Dennis if you want

12:43.200 --> 12:50.160
I also just want to say I always love when people um include these fake names as though like saying

12:50.160 --> 12:55.760
his actual name Jerry would totally give him away well I mean fandoms are capable of literally

12:55.760 --> 13:03.920
anything and you know I love our listeners but anything's possible um uh as as they got uh that

13:03.920 --> 13:09.600
shrimp heaven now kid had got elected mayor of his city it's true in any way capable of doing that

13:09.600 --> 13:14.560
as we settled into our home I began doing yard work and used a big orange bucket thank you for

13:14.560 --> 13:19.840
the aesthetic details they really helped to paint a picture a big orange bucket that I found in the

13:19.840 --> 13:25.200
home to take pulled weeds to throw in the brush in the backyard after using this bucket a few times

13:25.200 --> 13:32.080
I noticed that it has Rory or Dennis written across it I didn't make the connection at first

13:32.080 --> 13:37.200
so I continued to use it until I finally click what you didn't make the connection that's not

13:37.200 --> 13:41.920
a very difficult connection that's a good easy connection I feel like it's not fucking zodiac

13:41.920 --> 13:50.320
killer it said Rory on it or Dennis did the former home homeowners steal this bucket am I stealing

13:50.320 --> 13:58.160
this bucket do I return it to the owner do I hide it behind his shed do I buy my own orange bucket

13:58.160 --> 14:02.640
and write my name across it and pretend this nightmare never happened help that's from the

14:02.640 --> 14:07.280
real bucket thief it sounds like your conscience has already spoken just based on the title that

14:07.280 --> 14:13.040
you've chosen for yourself there that you know this is bucket crime and you are continuing to

14:13.040 --> 14:18.880
be party to it you're not the maybe the the perpetrator but you are an accomplice certainly

14:18.880 --> 14:24.320
you are profiting from the bucket this is actually a really good question because you legally bought

14:24.320 --> 14:29.520
everything in the house if they left it there that's your property you own it

14:32.320 --> 14:38.320
I've always wanted a loaning scenario would happen because it would take I would need to

14:38.320 --> 14:44.320
I would need a bucket pretty bad before I would break into my neighbor's look at him over there

14:44.320 --> 14:50.160
using that beautiful orange bucket again one of these days when he's not looking it'll be

14:50.160 --> 14:55.040
he could throw anything in there and carry it from place to place as a little effort I bet

14:55.040 --> 15:00.240
he could even put liquids in there no way yeah yeah I asked him I said Dennis where did you get

15:00.240 --> 15:07.360
that nice bucket and he told me to fuck off can you believe that Valerie he told me to fuck off

15:07.360 --> 15:13.680
so I'm putting together a team I need someone who can do flips someone who can lift things

15:13.680 --> 15:19.600
a guy who has pencils Valerie you're gonna seduce him and I don't listen I know I've had you seduce

15:19.600 --> 15:24.560
a lot of neighbors for a lot of buckets but this one's different this is the last one last job

15:24.560 --> 15:31.840
after this one we can retire um this is I I don't know my neighbors super well and I feel genuinely

15:31.840 --> 15:37.200
guilty about that because I feel I on paper I like the idea of knowing all my neighbors and

15:37.200 --> 15:45.360
getting together for backyard barbecues and bocce ball and what have you um and this seems like a

15:45.360 --> 15:50.720
good opportunity to like go talk to your neighbor you know what I mean like I would never just like

15:50.720 --> 15:55.280
go ring the doorbell and invite them to dinner although I'm sure they would be into that um

15:55.280 --> 16:02.400
because of my considerable anxiety but if I had an like a reason to go talk to them I think I

16:02.400 --> 16:05.680
would I think you should I think you should jump at it I think everybody could do better to like

16:05.680 --> 16:09.280
know their neighbors a little bit better and this seems like a chance to do that and have a reason

16:09.280 --> 16:14.640
for it I bought a house recently and we have a big uh like bay window in the living room and

16:14.640 --> 16:18.960
there's this older gentleman who lives in the house across the street and he likes to spend his

16:18.960 --> 16:23.840
time on nice days just sitting on a chair on his lawn and so I like to stand in front of my bay

16:23.840 --> 16:32.160
window and look at him and saying old man look at my life and I uh laugh really hard every time I

16:32.160 --> 16:37.200
do it but you don't go talk to him and see if no no no no no no no you are you are I should

16:37.200 --> 16:43.680
advise you Travis you're in a window right now where you please don't be like me in every house

16:43.680 --> 16:49.600
I've ever owned please learn your neighbor's names now and write them down somewhere because

16:49.600 --> 16:53.520
you won't need them frequently enough to remember them and you are definitely going to get to a

16:53.520 --> 16:58.880
window where it would be weird to ask them their name yeah like you are you're hurtling towards

16:58.880 --> 17:02.880
that window from the day you buy the house are you ready that comes over my across the street

17:02.880 --> 17:08.800
neighbor that comes over to use my phone sometimes uh-huh I I she told me her name once the first

17:08.800 --> 17:12.720
time she borrowed the phone and I didn't know it's going to be a repeated thing so I didn't

17:12.720 --> 17:19.360
remember it and now look at me we actually play with fire one step deeper where Teresa and I

17:19.360 --> 17:25.280
within the walls of our own home refer to anyone who lives around us as neighbor Reno so I thought

17:25.280 --> 17:29.440
I was like did you see what neighbor Reno was doing over there oh what was neighbor Reno doing

17:29.440 --> 17:34.480
and one of these days I will talk to that person and I will call them neighbor Reno to their face

17:34.480 --> 17:39.360
because I'm a monster who can't control themselves neighbor Reno's fun yeah that sounds like you're

17:39.360 --> 17:43.920
on some Flanders shit I don't even I don't even have I have there's a old every day I drive to

17:43.920 --> 17:48.080
daycare drop my son off not every day like four days a week and when I drive back it always times

17:48.080 --> 17:53.680
out that I drive by an old man who lives near me he's always chomping an unlit cigar he's walking

17:53.680 --> 17:58.960
his dog passing the same street every time we are kindred spirits we are always in the same place

17:59.680 --> 18:03.040
don't know nothing about him except he likes to walk his dog on that street and chewing on that

18:03.040 --> 18:09.520
cigar I'm gonna call him Jack from now on because he looks like a jack I so having just bought a

18:09.520 --> 18:15.200
house this is our first permanent residence like house we've ever bought and it's amazing how your

18:15.200 --> 18:21.600
psychology changes I took my dog out into the backyard to use the restroom her not me and

18:23.040 --> 18:29.840
I will often use the small wet room and then put pajama pants back on and so like I was wearing

18:29.840 --> 18:36.080
some Muppets pajama pants that Mary Small got me they're great and I made eye contact with

18:36.080 --> 18:41.440
my neighbor who was like fully dressed because it was 2 30 in the afternoon and he was dressed like

18:41.440 --> 18:48.640
you know a person an adult and I realized like oh I can't just move now I own this place I'm

18:48.640 --> 18:53.680
trapped here forever and to you I'll always be that 12 year old adult who lives next door yeah

18:53.680 --> 18:59.600
oh no and that that dookie is gonna stay there and you own that house and you gotta do something

18:59.600 --> 19:04.480
about it if it's a rental or a lease you can leave and then in a year or so won't be your problem

19:05.520 --> 19:11.840
didn't think about that I bet are you talking about dog dookie I cleaned it up so yeah I got

19:11.840 --> 19:18.240
one for you sent him by uh zooey or zoe porter thank you it's from yahoo answers user what

19:18.800 --> 19:27.520
I'll go do a rado oh this is br answers.yahoo.com okay it's it's yeah all right it's something

19:27.520 --> 19:31.680
uh thank thank you sorry something's gone wrong ask this question I'm gonna call him

19:32.320 --> 19:39.760
Raquel asks do you think that Mr Bean is sexy

19:41.120 --> 19:47.840
hmm I read this and at first I thought maybe it's one of those dang trolls maybe we got a real

19:47.840 --> 19:53.120
ogre in the mix a real shrek situation on our hands but then I pondered it and I don't know

19:53.120 --> 19:57.760
where to land on the last thing I want to do is objectify Mr Bean or actor Rowan Atkinson

19:57.760 --> 20:03.520
who plays Mr Bean but it's it's it's a it's an interesting sort of subject to tackle because

20:05.200 --> 20:11.600
is Mr is Mr Bean sexy is I guess the core sort of question I'm struggling with he's successful

20:12.240 --> 20:19.360
and success can be sexy right probably one of the best known British characters of all time

20:19.360 --> 20:26.080
um funny a lot of people think that humor can be sexy or sexual makes you really horny when you

20:26.080 --> 20:33.040
laugh at it and prudence and a good problem solver and I think there's a lot of qualities about Mr

20:33.040 --> 20:38.960
Bean that is sexy and makes you horny if you really want to drill down it were there ever any

20:38.960 --> 20:44.320
racier Mr Bean bit I'm not listen I'm not trying to get blue I'm not saying like a sexy I'm glad

20:44.320 --> 20:48.000
you asked that Travis because there was the one in the swimming pool where he gets really scared

20:48.000 --> 20:52.800
up on the diving board and crawls down for him but he's wearing a very tight fitting sort of

20:52.800 --> 20:57.760
pair of trunks or bathing suit where you can see I guess a little bit of his butt and probably

20:57.760 --> 21:04.800
if you look really hard on the 4k blu-rays a little bit of penile shape do you think he calls

21:04.800 --> 21:09.280
him Mr Bean yeah yeah was there because I think there could have been a lot of humor I just see a

21:09.280 --> 21:15.840
lot of uh like situations ripe for humor like Mr. Bean Mr. Bean shaves his balls right that's

21:15.840 --> 21:21.920
funny no no no no no no sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry thank you Dustin yeah you did say Mr. Bean

21:21.920 --> 21:30.960
so we are going to have to take a quick break my flexible friend I have to I have to shave my

21:30.960 --> 21:38.320
balls Mr. Wayne if you'll excuse me that's not what Bane even sounded like that was Sean Connery

21:38.320 --> 21:42.880
kind of a maybe oh that's the only way I can do Bane is that you kind of Bane Connery his take on

21:42.880 --> 21:50.560
Bane um I want to just hop into the comments here and just pick some of those apart uh Ramos Jr. 107

21:50.560 --> 21:57.360
says in his own way lol and I like that yeah to anybody he is confident I think in the way that

21:57.360 --> 22:02.000
he does his stuff and confidence is well here's let me tell you what's messed up about this

22:02.000 --> 22:05.920
question Griffin that I've just realized psychologically the only reason someone asked

22:05.920 --> 22:12.080
this question is a they believe he is sexy and are looking for confirmation or they believe

22:12.080 --> 22:18.320
he is sexy and are looking for confirmation or b someone has told them that Mr. Bean is sexy and

22:18.320 --> 22:25.360
they disagree but in either case a human being has stated or felt that he is sexy answering the

22:25.360 --> 22:30.800
question this isn't a question you think like I don't and no one I know does but maybe the internet

22:30.800 --> 22:36.080
thinks otherwise you only ask this if you want confirmation I don't think and beauty's in the

22:36.080 --> 22:41.200
eye of the holder especially when you're looking at being I want to dive down into this one from

22:41.200 --> 22:46.480
he ie Rowan Atkinson is dressed as Blackadder Elizabethan version in that leather doublet and

22:46.480 --> 22:55.040
that beard and then they say not af like apostrophe alf like maybe uh you're saying it with a bit of

22:55.040 --> 23:00.320
an affectation but I'm glad that apostrophe is there or else this person would have said not alf

23:00.320 --> 23:06.480
it's not he didn't play out he isn't not out just to be clear now you're not talking about alfar

23:06.480 --> 23:10.880
it now I guess and what we need to dive into next and we still have the Mr. Bean question

23:10.880 --> 23:16.640
on the table but if alf is sexy or not well this is how you build like a logical threat and if we

23:16.640 --> 23:23.280
can establish that alf is sexy I think that will prove that Mr. Bean is sexy I know it's hard to

23:25.120 --> 23:28.560
yes exactly thank you a equals bc equals alf

23:30.400 --> 23:34.560
is Mr. Bean Justin you've been sort of quiet on the subject I'll tell you what alf is really good

23:34.560 --> 23:41.760
at hmm nope oh god it's I was gonna make a joke about eating cats and I think you can see where

23:41.760 --> 23:49.680
I was going but I'm not gonna say Travis you can park the car outside but everyone knows you drove

23:49.680 --> 23:58.880
there I'm sorry sorry sorry Fred no that's the best metaphor I've ever heard for that kind of

23:58.880 --> 24:05.280
thank you Justin rules rules are rules um here's another question moving on before he wants to

24:05.280 --> 24:12.320
weigh in on the comedy I'll just say it I think yeah he's pretty sexy okay I think yes strong

24:12.320 --> 24:20.800
silent type etc etc uh in the last city I lived there is what I and many others believe to be an

24:20.800 --> 24:28.480
authentic bona fide Jimmy Buffett's margaritaville after visiting I never got the hype okay until I

24:28.480 --> 24:33.680
saw a photo from an actual margaritaville thanks Justin and realized that ours isn't the real thing

24:34.480 --> 24:42.080
instead it's just this fancy seaside bar and grill that has stolen the good name for their own uses

24:42.080 --> 24:47.600
everyone I've talked to believes that this place is the real deal straight from the j man himself

24:48.480 --> 24:55.120
what do I do how do I expose this establishment for their blatant fraud and that's from confused

24:55.120 --> 25:03.120
in paradise okay so hmm the the fact that there were eight tees in Jimmy Buffett's margaritaville

25:03.120 --> 25:09.520
should have been the first tip off um because that's not the real Jimmy Buffett uh it was Jimmy

25:09.520 --> 25:16.720
Buffett's daiquiri town here's the thing don't you think if you looked at him playing said this

25:16.720 --> 25:22.160
is a Jimmy Buffett's margaritaville right and they responded well you know that's hard it's hard to

25:22.160 --> 25:31.280
say what is the Jimmy Buffett's margaritaville really what I that's a weird listen I don't think

25:31.280 --> 25:37.840
James is particularly litigious but I think that he does try to keep the margaritaville thing pretty

25:37.840 --> 25:43.120
close to the vest what with the chain of restaurants and the rum yeah it's like he's walking around

25:43.120 --> 25:47.200
to everyone drinking a margarita and he's like no it smacks it out of hand that's mine you gotta

25:47.200 --> 25:54.880
pay me five dollars but I do think in this one case you're probably right if you call it Jimmy

25:54.880 --> 26:01.120
Buffett's right you just can't that's James's James wrote that for himself and he shared it

26:01.120 --> 26:07.120
with us but not in this way you're this is I'll tell you what though I do have to call it a

26:07.120 --> 26:14.880
question your determination here because like you didn't this is probably the the I assume

26:14.880 --> 26:20.960
the biggest platform in which you will share this information and you withheld a lot of crucial

26:20.960 --> 26:26.720
details that we could use to completely put them on fucking blast yeah right they would be they

26:26.720 --> 26:31.680
would be currently being annihilated right now I would yelp them into non-existence please don't

26:31.680 --> 26:36.320
please don't do that option please don't do that but like no don't do that at all listen we aren't

26:36.320 --> 26:42.560
lawyers we aren't experts and I also don't want the burden of costing a number of people their jobs

26:42.560 --> 26:48.560
on my conscience so like but you don't have to close it just call it something else you call it

26:48.560 --> 26:54.960
something else Jimmy Buffett's would you care for a margarita sir I think Trav I'm not I'm

26:54.960 --> 27:00.240
not I'm again no legal expert I think calling your restaurant Jimmy Buffett's fucking anything

27:00.240 --> 27:06.960
yes oh I see what the problem can I hit you with a possible name Tony Keith's I love this pub and

27:06.960 --> 27:13.920
restaurant he's not using that anymore is he what's that he's not using that anymore he might

27:13.920 --> 27:18.320
even just give it to you well that's it now who is Tony Keith though is the real question

27:22.000 --> 27:31.760
McDonald's what about a McBottles hi welcome to Burger King it's welcome to Burger King it's the

27:31.760 --> 27:39.440
new good restaurant still frame flame broiled you're gonna love these these good burgers you can

27:39.440 --> 27:45.600
have it whichever way have it whichever way you'd like it to be today our king isn't creepy

27:46.320 --> 27:56.160
McBonald's I'm enjoying it I'm enjoying it ba ba ba ba do hmm okay Cindy's Cindy's

27:56.160 --> 28:04.080
our our hamburger patties are octagons it's weird right it's weird we say welcome to the octagon

28:04.080 --> 28:12.640
when you come in this is this is this is welcome to RC's opening up opening up a restaurant is the

28:12.640 --> 28:20.240
most like risky thing you can do in the business world right like what's this like nine out of

28:20.240 --> 28:26.080
every 10 like flop in the first year or so like well you have to think that your only goal when

28:26.080 --> 28:30.080
you open a restaurant is you have to think in your head like you know how up till now people

28:30.080 --> 28:38.160
have not known where to get food well now yeah let me step in why why run the risk of in addition

28:38.160 --> 28:45.760
to like the pressures of the free food market um open yourself up to a cease and desist from

28:45.760 --> 28:52.240
the historically chill island man jimmy buffett it doesn't it doesn't it does not make sense to me

28:52.240 --> 29:05.360
unless unless this place was open first jimmy was a big fan oh shit my great great grandfather

29:05.360 --> 29:16.400
james t buffett loved margaritas and villages and he combined those loves into jimmy buffett's

29:16.400 --> 29:24.400
margarita and this no talent hack comes in and says hello my name is dennis lahoya and i'm going

29:24.400 --> 29:30.560
to take it all now there's also a possibility that it's a fair use parody and we should always

29:30.560 --> 29:39.360
keep that in mind too um that's a that's an option i think just keep just if jimmy's ever in town

29:39.920 --> 29:46.240
just slide him a card just walk up to him this won't be a problem just walk up to him

29:46.240 --> 29:51.280
slide him a note and just with an address or if you can meet him in a parking garage

29:51.280 --> 29:55.840
that would actually be great too if you can arrange that is it is it not maybe it's totally

29:55.840 --> 30:02.080
legal to open up a bar based on any song title and then it's because it's public it's public

30:02.080 --> 30:08.960
domain is what that is and i took i took one sort of law class in college and it was mostly

30:08.960 --> 30:16.480
like fair use law but i think if you call a bar like you ought to know or um you ought to know

30:16.480 --> 30:20.960
be the worst name for a restaurant ever because it kind of implies like you ought to know what's

30:20.960 --> 30:24.960
in here you ought to know what our food is i think if you open up a restaurant restaurant

30:24.960 --> 30:29.600
and you call it despacito featuring daddy yankee then you're totally in the clear

30:30.560 --> 30:34.080
but you have to put daddy yankee in quotes because it is a person's actual name

30:34.080 --> 30:39.840
well now that is a restaurant i would go to despacito featuring daddy yankee and you have to

30:39.840 --> 30:43.600
say it like that because of the quotes not a lot of people know this but if you ever look at

30:43.600 --> 30:48.400
copyright documents it actually just says like we would really appreciate it if you didn't

30:49.040 --> 30:54.320
but there's like no legal ramifications totally copyright it's just kind of like hey it would be

30:54.320 --> 31:01.120
really cool if you didn't you know make a movie called mad max like we'd really appreciate it if

31:01.120 --> 31:06.800
you like wouldn't we're gonna it's trademarked so please don't please but if you do there's

31:06.800 --> 31:13.440
nothing we can do about it uh let's take a break right now and uh travel over to the money zone

31:14.080 --> 31:19.920
to earn our money money we're gonna get money we're gonna talk about stuff and get money from

31:19.920 --> 31:35.360
it great because that's our crafts our first sponsor is me undies and we told you all about

31:35.360 --> 31:40.880
their underwear and it's extremely good underwear and everybody should have it but if underwear is

31:40.880 --> 31:46.400
not your thing uh we are excited to announce that me undies socks are finally here me undies socks

31:46.400 --> 31:50.880
are spun from premium materials they're dedicated to making the most comfortable pair of underwear

31:50.880 --> 31:56.800
and now socks you will ever own i got a couple pairs of these socks and they are they fit real

31:56.800 --> 32:04.880
nice they feel real nice they got a nice grip on them and um they are they have a sort of covert

32:05.520 --> 32:09.520
hemline a lot of people will look and be like are you wearing socks you're like no they're just

32:09.520 --> 32:14.880
barely there me undies so comfortable so fashionable so stylish have you guys ever

32:14.880 --> 32:21.920
thought about the fact that socks are like the donut holes of underpants whoa that's deep because

32:21.920 --> 32:26.320
you put your foot through the leg hole to put them on right and the sock stays on your foot and the

32:26.320 --> 32:31.120
rest goes up around your thing so like if you sewed the sock to the leg hole you'd close it up

32:31.760 --> 32:35.120
well that would not be very comfortable no but that's this is what i'm saying is

32:35.120 --> 32:40.320
is the donut hole of underpants i've thought about it for the past 12 seconds and decided

32:40.320 --> 32:44.560
what you just said was garbo nonsense you know what here's the thing though griffin you're gonna

32:44.560 --> 32:49.600
be lying awake in your own mouth won't and yes i will the dat part will be true yes okay and then

32:49.600 --> 32:53.680
it's gonna hit you if like oh that makes total sense because if the sock was sewn to the bottom

32:53.680 --> 32:57.920
of the underpants i'd try to pull the underpants on but i couldn't get past my feet but if i pulled

32:57.920 --> 33:01.840
hard enough but if it pulled hard enough the underpants would come with it sock would stay

33:01.840 --> 33:07.280
on my foot boom sock underpants separated might be garbo nonsense i'll think about it though i

33:07.280 --> 33:10.800

lounge pants they are life-changing uh who wants to tell us about our next sponsor i do i do i do

33:50.240 --> 33:54.240
it's nature box we all want to eat better but when it comes to snacks sometimes it feels like the

33:54.240 --> 34:00.640
whole world is delicious and a billion calories are boring and tasteless but it doesn't have to

34:00.640 --> 34:09.280
be that way nature box has over 100 000 no sorry 100 snacks that's still a lot of snacks that's a

34:09.280 --> 34:14.560
good amount of still a lot of snacks i shouldn't have i i should have gone they have 10 snacks

34:14.560 --> 34:21.200

39:44.240 --> 39:50.480
conference about it this always has helped us in the past oh oh gosh this has become a defense

39:50.480 --> 39:54.800
mechanism justin i want to deflect

39:54.800 --> 40:05.680
what a burger

40:10.320 --> 40:12.000
can't make you laugh what a burger

40:13.120 --> 40:18.880
up until now everyone has known what a burger as the place at the dallas airport where i saw

40:18.880 --> 40:29.920
cardinals what a burger thing but there's a new thing in town what a burger is launching

40:29.920 --> 40:38.880
the tree is a burger with creamy chili sauce this press this press release i like because a lot of

40:38.880 --> 40:44.960
times in these press releases people are trying too hard and i feel like in this one they didn't

40:44.960 --> 40:51.360
try very much at all and maybe they were just sort of writing it word by word not really knowing what

40:51.360 --> 40:58.240
the next word would be chorizo a type of ground sausage that derives its bold taste profile and

40:58.240 --> 41:03.920
deep red color from a fresh blend of spices is already a staple in many places and gaining in

41:03.920 --> 41:10.640
popularity so already what a burger is on the defensive um they're saying chorizo is actually

41:10.640 --> 41:18.240
good so calm down we're late to this category uh but trust us lots of other people do it i also

41:18.240 --> 41:23.440
really like the first half of that sentence sounds straight off wikipedia like yeah here's

41:23.440 --> 41:27.440
right but then the second half of the sentence kind of peters out like a kid who like copied

41:27.440 --> 41:31.840
and pasted and like well i can't just leave that i have to add something to it and also i really

41:31.840 --> 41:38.720
liked the book and also characters were good the dog represented uh industrial revolution

41:38.720 --> 41:47.120
the sizzling chorizo gives the burger a bold taste while a blend of fire roasted poblano

41:47.120 --> 41:53.920
peppers red peppers and onions give it a fresh bite what a burger combine these two ingredients

41:53.920 --> 41:59.360
with the new creamy chili sauce two slices of monterey jack cheese and two fresh all beef

41:59.360 --> 42:07.040
patties for a unique burger with the perfect balance of spice so those two paragraphs are

42:07.040 --> 42:13.120
already in it right and then they go into rich's office and they're like rich help me i wrote two

42:13.120 --> 42:17.360
paragraphs and i don't fucking know what else to say we can't just send out two paragraphs and

42:17.360 --> 42:25.040
rich is like no problem i've got it quote mexican style chorizo makes this burger unique with this

42:25.040 --> 42:31.440
deep red color we're still very hung up on the deep red color of chorizo that's very important

42:31.440 --> 42:39.280
with its deep red color fresh blend of spices and bold flavorful profile says rich the whataburger

42:39.280 --> 42:46.880
vice president of marketing and innovation the flavors on this burger blend nicely for a balance

42:49.200 --> 42:55.200
for a balanced but savory taste we think our customers will really enjoy it now i want to take

42:55.200 --> 43:02.560
two things i need to break off here he clarifies that it's savory okay you're not cinnabon there's

43:02.560 --> 43:08.080
not a question in my mind of what the flavor profile is going to be on this burger you do not

43:08.080 --> 43:13.920
need to clarify for me that it is a savory taste and then he says we think our customers will

43:13.920 --> 43:18.960
really enjoy which i really appreciate the humility because he could have very easily said no

43:18.960 --> 43:25.920
but no he said think listen we took our breast guess and here's what we know there's a bold red

43:25.920 --> 43:34.160
color on this lots of other people are doing it spices and it's a fresh blend and a bite and

43:34.160 --> 43:40.080
there's spices and a deep red color and we fucking we're out of ideas over here at whataburger so if

43:40.080 --> 43:45.040
you listen other people are doing it just trust us about this if you have anything if you have any

43:45.040 --> 43:50.880
if you have anything if you have any new ideas please let us know we are just hard i love that

43:50.880 --> 43:58.400
in like the that statement there's so many different uh like uh so many uh synonyms for

43:58.400 --> 44:06.480
blend and spices like the mix of flavors is great the blend of spices is great the morass of

44:06.480 --> 44:10.800
tastations it's wonderful you're gonna love that it's just everything you can do be like we put a

44:10.800 --> 44:15.760
bunch of like fucking flavors in it is that okay do you you're gonna eat it you won't even know if

44:15.760 --> 44:21.360
you like it there's just so much flavor and then you'll be done please enjoy it we hope we we think

44:21.360 --> 44:27.680
you will the chorizo burger is only available for a limited time and then in a parenthetical it says

44:27.680 --> 44:32.240
no exact dates to share so they're really just taking whenever whenever the chorizo runs out

44:32.240 --> 44:36.560
yeah whenever you guys stop liking it you can tell us we'll take it away we're so sorry we

44:36.560 --> 44:41.120
bought 50 pounds of chorizo from somebody that promises people like it we're just gonna see what

44:41.120 --> 44:48.240
happens i wait our sister's kid has invested in chorizo he's promised us you'll really like it

44:48.240 --> 44:55.360
i these motherfuckers have i kid you not a bullet pointed list that i will spare you but a bullet

44:55.360 --> 45:02.240
pointed list of everything that is on the burger and it covers exactly they they did it in prose

45:02.240 --> 45:08.080
and then they wanted to break it down into like the real nitty gritty of exactly what's on this

45:08.080 --> 45:14.240
motherfucker and that is available for a limited time they're also doing a spiced up chorizo

45:14.240 --> 45:23.360
sausage what a burger late night and breakfast with the uh uh and then there's a taquito i just

45:23.360 --> 45:30.240
slice of american cheese in it which does seem strange not how the taquito was intended but okay

45:30.240 --> 45:34.320
i just like i would eat one of these i think it sounds good i'm a fan of chorizo but i will say

45:34.320 --> 45:41.440
this blend of lots of meat and spicy sauce and spicy cheese like they may as well get like

45:42.640 --> 45:47.840
fucking oscar de lohoya to come in and duct tape this to a boxing glove and just punch it directly

45:47.840 --> 45:54.960
into my stomach because it will be that will essentially be the result of this event just get

45:54.960 --> 45:59.360
like chuck laddell to come in and duct tape it to his foot and just kick it right into like my

45:59.360 --> 46:05.120
fucking ribs because that'll basically be about where i'm at i'm sorry they have a list there's

46:05.120 --> 46:13.520
four things in the taquito there's a soft flour tortilla scrambled eggs chorizo there's a colon

46:13.520 --> 46:22.720
and it says fresh blend of spices sizzling bold flavorful deep red color you get this right it's

46:22.720 --> 46:31.680
red fucking red one slice of american cheese listen the trees it's just deep red it's so

46:31.680 --> 46:35.920
beautiful and none of us can bring ourselves to taste it but here's what we know about it just

46:35.920 --> 46:41.920
from observing it deep red color and there seems to be a lot of fucking spices in there yeah i'm

46:41.920 --> 46:47.520

47:08.160 --> 47:13.360
to make a spa what will really put it over the top and how can i beat other competitors

47:13.360 --> 47:20.640
hmm you go to the spa maybe you're getting a rub or uh oils applied to you or uh some sort of

47:20.640 --> 47:27.680
exfoliating treatment or maybe you're in a mud situation for a while that's all standard operating

47:27.680 --> 47:34.720
procedure this person wants to take their spa over the top and beat the shit out of their

47:34.720 --> 47:39.680
competitors and travis has i've stalled for long enough go trap i've got it thank you every other

47:39.680 --> 47:48.560
every other spa right every other spa thank you pampers yeah pampers here right they they treat

47:48.560 --> 47:57.040
you like a little baby who needs a good rub down oh you need facial wrap right not this spa this

47:57.040 --> 48:05.680
spa is fucking hardcore you got people yelling at you like you massage rocks yeah they like you

48:05.680 --> 48:12.560
have to like slide down i don't know like sandpaper takes fully at your skin it's a really

48:12.560 --> 48:19.200
it is not a relaxing experience at all when you said this spa rocks i wish you had stopped because

48:19.200 --> 48:24.640
that painted such a beautiful picture in my mind of travis mcelroy's rock and roll spa

48:24.640 --> 48:28.960
which is a great name for a business so much better than tony keese i love this public restaurant

48:28.960 --> 48:35.360
um that i think we could have a lot of fun with it like maybe we just have like a lot of you know

48:35.360 --> 48:42.080
heavy shredding taking place in the background while people assail you with sandpaper and

48:43.440 --> 48:48.000
rolling pins but in a way that still feels good at the end of the day but you're you're also

48:48.000 --> 48:53.920
listening to pantera here's what we're gonna call it we're gonna call it dick's last spa and resort

48:54.640 --> 48:59.520
and it's gonna be that's very good by the way take a moment to let it sink in because it's like

48:59.520 --> 49:06.320
really good and that's all that i had for that great great because dick's last spa and resort

49:06.320 --> 49:12.400
do you understand now yeah i have another one i have another idea here this is my idea um take

49:12.400 --> 49:17.840
a lap take a lap justin anyone who's ever been to a spa knows that there's always a moment where

49:17.840 --> 49:23.920
they like leave you alone in a room or like set something down in front of you and you have a

49:23.920 --> 49:28.960
moment where like what what am i supposed to do but you're afraid to ask but then after that comes

49:28.960 --> 49:36.800
a nice relaxing experience but what if the whole spa was just built to confuse you into relaxation

49:36.800 --> 49:43.040
okay okay and so like you walk into a room they hand you a plunger and say i'll be back when

49:43.040 --> 49:47.920
you're ready and leave and the room is completely empty right and you're just left to figure and

49:47.920 --> 49:55.200
they never come back you walk in there's a table there and the room is dark and they say i okay so

49:55.200 --> 49:59.280
uh any trouble areas oh your neck and shoulders okay you work at a desk you seem tense all right

49:59.280 --> 50:03.920
um so go ahead and lay down we'll get started uh go ahead and undress to my level of comfort

50:03.920 --> 50:09.600
good luck goodbye they take you into a walk-in closet and say dress more to your level of

50:09.600 --> 50:14.080
comfort and then leave and you're like is that two more jackets where where am i at with this

50:14.080 --> 50:17.600
if we really are looking to improve the spa process i wish they would just say

50:17.600 --> 50:21.920
get take off your all of the clothes and get on the table because the get it out

50:21.920 --> 50:27.360
dress to dress to your level of comfort is is a very kind way of saying like

50:27.360 --> 50:36.480
oh you're gonna do naked okay i got i got i got a massage when i was like 22 and they said that

50:36.480 --> 50:40.320
and left the room and i was like i honestly had not even thought about that part of the equation

50:40.880 --> 50:46.880
and huge anxiety and so i just thought like does that mean underwear it probably means

50:46.880 --> 50:53.520
underwear it didn't mean underwear i guessed wrong i made an incorrect guess i think we have found

50:53.520 --> 51:00.400
an easy way to to improve your spa is just directly clarify you should be like multiple

51:00.400 --> 51:06.640
posted signage exactly how much you should undress this is the correct one card of each spa

51:06.640 --> 51:13.040
like if you move into this room and you haven't redressed from the last room bad bad job robe

51:13.040 --> 51:20.400
you're fine that's fine this is robe comfort here wait outside your competitors and as people leave

51:21.120 --> 51:27.280
offer them a massage and if they let you then just start loudly and now it's like hey this

51:27.280 --> 51:32.560
guy just left this spa and he's letting me massage he must not have done a very good job

51:32.560 --> 51:38.880
because i i wouldn't want that so you stand outside el haji to try to relax some more and if you can

51:38.880 --> 51:43.600
then then they must have been relaxed must have been very good like must not have been a very good

51:43.600 --> 51:48.480
massage i got a massage about a month ago i was feeling extremely stressed out i thought i'm gonna

51:48.480 --> 51:54.000
treat myself i went in i literally slept through the whole fucking thing like is that level of

51:54.000 --> 51:59.280
pressure good yeah it's good gone out done out for an hour i slept through the whole thing and

51:59.280 --> 52:04.960
so like i think that a good sort of new process would just be if they see you i'd snore so i they

52:04.960 --> 52:10.320
definitely knew maybe a little pinch a little courtesy pinch right right in the you know the

52:10.320 --> 52:14.480
armpit fat just get in there and just say like hey sorry you were snoring and i don't want you

52:14.480 --> 52:19.600
to miss a thing because you paid a lot of money for this and it's supposed to be nice i have a

52:19.600 --> 52:26.640
tendency um if anyone ever asked me like a question about how much pressure i could take i am a monster

52:26.640 --> 52:32.240
and will say 10 when that's not true and so like i got this massage at the moment was like one to

52:32.240 --> 52:38.400
10 and i was like 10 and it was it hurts so bad it hurts so much but if you say something it'll

52:38.400 --> 52:43.120
drop i couldn't say three i couldn't say it and it was always like just as i was about to say like

52:43.120 --> 52:48.480
no you know what no uncle uncle you win like she wouldn't move to another spot and so it's just like

52:49.120 --> 52:56.240
by the end of that like half hour or whatever 60 minutes it was i was just i was in i my whole body

52:56.240 --> 53:02.000
was a night i walked out of there like a fucking pretzel because i was so i was so stressed out

53:02.000 --> 53:09.440
from my massage because i was um too terrible a person to say like oh you know actually let's go

53:09.440 --> 53:16.560
to like the six like which i say now to you yeah and it's like the most normal thing speaking of

53:16.560 --> 53:23.760
anxiety uh i got a couples massage with my wife one time uh years ago before we had children and

53:23.760 --> 53:32.720
when we arrived for a massage there was a male masseuse and a woman masseuse and we were asked

53:32.720 --> 53:41.200
in the moment to sort of pick who we want to do a quick draft and the fucking calculations that i

53:41.200 --> 53:46.960
had to go through the kobayashi maru of that oh it's it's impossible there's nothing there's no

53:46.960 --> 53:53.040
option for me there i like i'll rub myself and you both rub her i think is where i ended up to be

53:53.040 --> 53:58.480
clear where you're saying that because like you don't want to come off as a homophobic but you

53:58.480 --> 54:04.320
also homophobic but i also don't want to come off as like oh hello yeah absolutely and i don't want

54:04.320 --> 54:10.160
to come off as like there's just no right answer i guess is what i'm saying there's no way this

54:10.160 --> 54:15.600
ahead of time to look at a person and say i would like to pay you to touch me it's one thing if i

54:15.600 --> 54:19.680
walk into a room and they're the only brother person there massage therapy is a legit very good

54:19.680 --> 54:24.880
very helpful thing it's a very good contribution to society it's it's i i understand what you're

54:24.880 --> 54:29.520
saying in what i'm saying is it's a challenge if i walk into a room and there's one other person

54:29.520 --> 54:36.640
there i know where we stand but if i walk into room and pick someone from a lineup that person

54:36.640 --> 54:41.200
knows i picked them over somebody else and that feels weird to me and also the other person is

54:41.200 --> 54:46.880
like so not me all right cool i'm super good at this what we're touching on is it's a very intimate

54:46.880 --> 54:53.920
thing i think in the massages is it i think because it's it's another person uh rubbing you

54:53.920 --> 54:59.120
all all over and it shouldn't be sexualized and i'm not saying i'm not introducing sexuality into

54:59.120 --> 55:04.560
it whatsoever i think it's a very intimate thing and this decision should not be in my hands it

55:04.560 --> 55:09.120
should just be the situation that i find myself in yeah i'm perfectly happy either way perfect

55:09.120 --> 55:13.280
i have to make the choice perfect spa over the top better than competitors you don't make that call

55:13.280 --> 55:18.960
you show up the massage is one thousand dollars and but you don't get to pick and they tell you

55:18.960 --> 55:22.480
just get nude and they pinch you if you fall asleep and then also they say go ahead and get

55:22.480 --> 55:28.560
dressed naked and lie down and it'll be totally great and you lie down and you feel hands on your

55:28.560 --> 55:33.600
back perfect amount of pressure every time and you're like whoa and you sort of get the inkling

55:33.600 --> 55:38.320
that this was not the person that walked me into the room and then you feel sort of somebody get

55:38.320 --> 55:45.440
leaning down close to you and then you hear let me sail let me sail let the orinoco flow and it

55:45.440 --> 55:50.720
is inya they just have inya to do it and you get the live performance right there it's not coming

55:50.720 --> 55:57.200
through it's not coming through any sort of loudspeaker situation it's really her and it's

55:57.200 --> 56:02.480
only time and it's right there and it's that's why it's a thousand dollars okay here's all right

56:02.480 --> 56:09.440
here's in the same thing pinch the dress signs but the massage is is a hundred thousand dollars

56:09.440 --> 56:15.440
oh god and when you walk in this the first thing you do is they take a snip of your hair

56:16.000 --> 56:21.920
and that's three months before and then when you walk in you lay down on the table and you feel

56:22.560 --> 56:28.880
hands they're strong but familiar and you look up it's you they've cloned you and

56:28.880 --> 56:37.520
and give it into a a sort of massage drone the year is 2178 yeah and they they've cloned you

56:37.520 --> 56:42.880
and you start to say like i'm tenso and they're like i know i know i was tense there too three

56:42.880 --> 56:48.640
months ago i remember now that is going i'm gonna go ahead and say this is a great premise for a

56:48.640 --> 56:54.000
sci-fi novel but at the end of that session you do have to murder them with your own hands because

56:54.000 --> 56:59.040
there can't be two of you walking around or it's gonna be a there's gonna be a lot of pivots is

56:59.040 --> 57:05.840
what i was gonna say is there's gonna be oh well no i am justin and i i am justin and i paid one

57:05.840 --> 57:12.400
hundred thousand dollars for the massage i'm going to go listen to the most beautiful classical music

57:12.400 --> 57:18.400
composition okay so you're the drone then right okay all right i'm not going to go listen to

57:18.400 --> 57:25.120
the most beautiful chopin piece i will go listen to jimmy buffett is his name and i love him and

57:25.120 --> 57:32.080
all of his songs jimmy buffett island music i love jamie buffett you're so you're the drone

57:32.080 --> 57:38.240
then and where's justin's body ah shoot we got another one so you know what you're just gonna

57:38.240 --> 57:44.400
drive yourself home yes i have eaten the keys and i am prepared to operate a motor i'm prepared to

57:44.400 --> 57:49.840
interface with the takoma all right so you're the drone then oh all right and you murdered them

57:49.840 --> 57:55.520
somebody called somebody calling the fucking rub runner because we got ourselves another one nice

57:56.480 --> 58:03.440
um i think the most relaxing thing you could do in a massage is like the person comes in and like

58:03.440 --> 58:07.520
they ask you how much and you're like it's perfectly rude it's fine it's fine then during

58:07.520 --> 58:11.680
the massage you lean down and you say it's a hundred thousand dollars and you feel them tense

58:11.680 --> 58:16.800
up and the 30 seconds later you say but i'm gonna give you a discount it's gonna be 20 bucks that

58:16.800 --> 58:22.480
would be the most relaxing moment of my life to suddenly find out relaxing yeah right like i can't

58:22.480 --> 58:28.880
afford that i can't afford that i'm walking on sunshine it's not just that you say it's a hundred

58:28.880 --> 58:33.840
thousand dollars and you instantly see where all the knots are when their body tenses up that's

58:33.840 --> 58:40.000
where you carry good and it's in you telling you so like that's that's it's a it's not the

58:40.000 --> 58:46.080
worst way to find out that you are now completely financially destitute uh folks that is gonna do

58:46.080 --> 58:51.600
it for us this week thank you so i hope we didn't stigmatize massage in any way i can't stress

58:51.600 --> 58:59.120
enough i love it and i'm not i i wasn't trying to say it's weird and sexual i'm saying is wonderful

58:59.120 --> 59:06.160
i just don't like i never liked being the captain of a of a team in in sports either to like say

59:06.160 --> 59:11.360
like you but not you but you i don't like it's an it's an into it's an intimate thing i think when

59:11.360 --> 59:17.040
you struggle with anxiety and just like talking to somebody then it's this introduces a few

59:17.040 --> 59:23.680
sort of things that are a little bit challenging to to get get to deal with but it's good uh it's

59:23.680 --> 59:28.240
good if you uh have any fun stories in your massage therapist or we got anything wrong or

59:28.240 --> 59:32.000
