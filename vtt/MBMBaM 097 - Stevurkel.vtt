00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:49.600
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:49.600 --> 00:56.080
era. Griffin, it's the most wonderful time of the year because it's time to pay the piper.

00:56.080 --> 01:04.960
Hmmmm. Bill's come due. Chuckle Bill has come due. You're not talking about the tax burden,

01:04.960 --> 01:11.840
the remarkable tax burden. Yeah, your ha ha tax. I'm confused. Who's Chuckle Bill?

01:13.760 --> 01:19.760
Travis, for every chuckle that we distribute, we have to then pay to the American government

01:19.760 --> 01:27.520
for 25% based on our tax bracket. Actually, they get 25% of our gefahs? We increased our chortles

01:28.320 --> 01:33.200
by a significant amount this year, I would say, just based on how the show has grown,

01:33.200 --> 01:40.640
and now we have to pay back 35%. Wow. Our last bracket is through the roof, and this is the

01:40.640 --> 01:48.720
one time of year where we come to you and we're just like, open them up. Open them up. Let me see

01:48.720 --> 01:55.040
them wallets. Open up the wallets. Let me dig around in there, and when I'm done, you will know.

01:55.040 --> 01:59.840
This wallet. Cause I'm gonna wreck your wallet. What is in this wallet? Is this a diner's club

01:59.840 --> 02:06.960
card? Oh, this wallet smells awful, but the money's good. Oh man, it spins. It may smell like

02:07.760 --> 02:13.440
an old man's sock drawer, but it spins just right. On a different note, while you guys are thinking

02:13.440 --> 02:20.000
about wallets, think about why you kept that fortune cookie fortune, cause it's not as funny

02:20.000 --> 02:26.080
as you think it is. On the subjects of wallets, I ain't trying to discriminate. Let's see those

02:26.080 --> 02:32.160
purses too. Ladies, pop them open. Pop them open, flip it upside down, shake it out, and let's just

02:32.160 --> 02:40.800
see. I'll take your crystal light powder that you mix with water. I don't care. I need a refreshing

02:40.800 --> 02:49.520
beverage on the go. The tax is due. It's Max Fun Drive 2012. I'm excited because we get to record

02:49.520 --> 02:57.760
a lot of extra stuff for people who keep this network going, and this is the one time of year

02:57.760 --> 03:05.520
that we asked you guys to help us keep it running. I'm excited because we are just fucking running on

03:05.520 --> 03:14.560
fumes over here. I've had nothing to eat for the past four days except for saltines and saltine

03:14.560 --> 03:18.480
water, which is when I crumble up saltines into water and make like a protein slurry.

03:20.160 --> 03:27.840
With no protein, it's really not a good nutritional option. So this is the Max Fun Drive

03:27.840 --> 03:36.320
2012. Of course, you can go right now to maximumfun.com. It's not maximumfun.com.

03:37.040 --> 03:45.120
Maximumfun.org. It's okay. I've only been here for a year and a half. Do you guys remember

03:45.120 --> 03:51.520
back when we joined the Max Fun and we were so happy? We used to be the new kid on the block.

03:51.520 --> 03:59.040
Last year, we were the new baby, the new face, but now we are the wizened older brother to

03:59.600 --> 04:05.600
throwing shade and technically international waters. I think we're adopted, guys. I'm

04:05.600 --> 04:10.320
worried we might be adopted. Have you noticed how we don't look anything like Jesse? We don't dress

04:10.320 --> 04:17.840
as well or anything. He's very tall. We are all, I would say, stocky. Stocky is fair. Hey, let's

04:17.840 --> 04:22.160
get into some advice. Well, let's introduce ourselves first, maybe. Oh, hey, fuck. I'm

04:22.160 --> 04:28.640
Justin McElroy. I'm your rich uncle, Justin McElroy. If you need to see more, open them up.

04:28.640 --> 04:35.760
I'm your upper middle class brother, Travis McElroy. I am the one percent but on the bottom

04:35.760 --> 04:44.560
part of Griffin. Griffin is the other end of the bell curve. This is our advice show. We'll talk

04:44.560 --> 04:52.000
more about Max Fun Drive here in a second, but first, let's get to some advice. First question

04:52.000 --> 05:00.000
comes in to us from Confused in Calgary who asks, I am going to be moving to a town in the Arctic

05:00.000 --> 05:06.240
this summer and in the Arctic, there we go, in the Arctic this summer and I don't have enough

05:06.240 --> 05:12.880
room for all my stuff. I'm only going up there for a few months and I have storage space lined up for

05:12.880 --> 05:19.120
everything I can't take. How should I prioritize what to bring and what to leave behind? I'm going

05:19.120 --> 05:24.160
to be honest, I don't think it's a good like line of goofing, but all I could think is like parkas

05:24.160 --> 05:31.040
and harpoons and that's probably not- I might actually be racist. A little bit, yeah. Oh no.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.520
Yeah, you might have tapped a vein there. We haven't even fought with Eskimo racism yet.

05:35.520 --> 05:40.480
Oh man, we're gonna get deep. This is the show to do it too when we're finally asking them for

05:40.480 --> 05:47.360
money. Well, not them. No, I'm asking them specifically for money. Hey, open your wallet

05:47.360 --> 06:01.600
and dip in you it. You dick. All right, idiot. Well, hey, how about this? Don't go there.

06:03.600 --> 06:08.400
Do you know how cold it is? Why didn't you come to us for advice when you were like,

06:08.400 --> 06:13.680
hey brothers, thinking about freezing my nuts out for three months. What's the scoop?

06:14.800 --> 06:20.800
Hey brothers, I just saw Grizzly Man followed by Into the Wild and man, I just can't stop thinking

06:20.800 --> 06:26.560
about how I want to go to a cold place and die. Hey brothers, I want to live my very own Terra

06:26.560 --> 06:33.920
Nova with me as Robert Falcon Scott leading an ill-fated band of explorers to the South Pole.

06:33.920 --> 06:42.400
Oh Lord, the toes come off in the boot. What can I do? Please help me. Extra toes. Can you pack

06:42.400 --> 06:48.640
extra toes? Brack, bring extra toes. Bring your ticket home when you realize you made a dumb

06:48.640 --> 06:55.360
choice. That's the only thing you need. Extra toes and your ticket home. It's too cold up there. It's

06:55.360 --> 07:04.400
not meant for people. It's meant for bears. Native Americans built a bridge in ancient times from Asia

07:04.400 --> 07:10.960
to Alaska so they could hoof it out of there. Now, I'm sorry, Justin. Yes. You do realize they did

07:10.960 --> 07:16.240
not build that bridge, right? It was a natural land bridge. They built a land bridge. What else

07:16.240 --> 07:21.680
were they going to build it out of, Travis? Plexiglass? Of course it's a land bridge.

07:21.680 --> 07:26.720
Exactly. You paint with the medium that's given to you and they had a shit ton of land until

07:26.720 --> 07:32.320
we came in and snatched it. Hey Bill, bring some of that land over here. Boy, I bet they wish they

07:32.320 --> 07:37.680
had not been so wasteful with their land as to build a bridge out of it had they known that we

07:37.680 --> 07:43.200
were going to come for it so hard. I'll be the first to say it. Not a very good bridge because

07:43.200 --> 07:49.600
where's that shit today? Yeah, how's your longevity? Not good? I am sorry to the Native

07:49.600 --> 07:55.840
American people for that. That was fucked up. Everything you said. We really blew it.

07:55.840 --> 08:01.200
Not the jokes, but what we did. I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't do that today.

08:01.200 --> 08:08.800
I'm sorry for us. I mean, obviously, whenever I go into any sort of situation where I'm not going

08:08.800 --> 08:13.280
to have access to all my beautiful things, my baubles that I bought with the money of Max

08:13.280 --> 08:19.840
Fundlisters, the main concern I have is entertainment. What if I'm bored? That's the

08:19.840 --> 08:24.800
terror that keeps me up. And you know what? The amazing thing about our modern age is that you

08:24.800 --> 08:31.360
can do things like the Kindle and laptops and condense all your media and stuff into one tiny

08:31.360 --> 08:38.080
container. Yeah. One single geocache and then hide it in the snow where no one will come for it.

08:38.080 --> 08:44.560
Yeah, that would be my very first thought. Get a Kindle or a Nook or an iPad or whatever.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.160
Can they get a Nanook? Get a Nanook.

08:49.360 --> 08:53.840
Wow. It's one of those shows, huh? What would you guys bring? What would be the first thing

08:53.840 --> 08:58.080
you would pack if you were leaving your home to accidentally go freeze to death?

08:58.080 --> 09:04.640
I would bring a hatchet and a copy of Gary Paulsen's hatchet so I know what to do because

09:04.640 --> 09:08.640
that kid got out. A-okay. Spoiler. He gets out all right.

09:08.640 --> 09:12.080
I would bring a hatchet hidden inside the book hatchet.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.960
I like it. And you open it up and you get the hatchet out. You say,

09:14.960 --> 09:17.680
okay, what? Ah, my book's a big empty square. Fuck.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.880
Can't read this.

09:20.880 --> 09:26.480
I will say this as a person who's crazy and has taken every opportunity to own knives and

09:26.480 --> 09:30.720
swords throughout my life. This would be like the time to buy a survival knife

09:30.720 --> 09:36.400
with like some flint in the handle and like a compass and shit. That'd be awesome.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.960
Well, preferably you would buy it before you go to the Arctic.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.040
I want an authentic. No, I want an authentic Arctic knife.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.200
You're saying step off the boat. Like, where's the knife store? Oh, fuck. Nobody's here. Nobody.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.040
I'm the only one. It's the Arctic.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.240
Why did I ask them? Why did I ask my brother, my brother,

09:52.240 --> 09:55.200
me if I should do this? I made such a huge mistake.

09:55.200 --> 10:00.160
Where is the local Excalibur store? Oh, those don't exist anymore anywhere

10:00.160 --> 10:02.560
on the planet anyways. Damn it.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.840
By the way, guys, Excalibur is the, it's the name of the, the, the,

10:09.440 --> 10:11.040
how would you even describe it?

10:11.040 --> 10:11.760
A sword.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.680
It's a curio slash weaponry shop.

10:13.680 --> 10:20.160
At the Huntington Mall, you can find Excalibur, which is a store that sells glass baubles.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.160
Like, like I'm talking like porcelain firemen.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.520
It's like glass menagerie shit. Like tiny crystal unicorns.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.960
Well, don't sell them short because they also trade in pewter.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.200
Yeah. Right. Pewter dragons.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.240
Pewter figurines.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.640
And knives and swords and throwing knives.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.360
Non-chaku.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.240
Ninja stars.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.480
Yeah. You can fully go to Excalibur if you're in Huntington.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.800
Like don't miss it because it's a bananas.

10:46.800 --> 10:52.160
Like we don't have niche stores here because there aren't enough niches to support them,

10:52.160 --> 10:58.160
but they, they will combine two niches like our Mexican pancake place.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.000
Flapjack Tanapas.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.840
Also very real. Huntington is really into mashups this year.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.520
Remix.

11:05.520 --> 11:10.720
Have you guys been to the bowler rank, which is like the roller rank only with bowling in it.

11:11.520 --> 11:16.880
So while it's, it's, it's well, but I mean, a ship in harbor, you know.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.560
Griffin, how about you hit me with a yahoo?

11:18.560 --> 11:20.480
Sure. This one was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.640
Thank you, Lisa.

11:22.640 --> 11:29.920
It is by yahoo answers user EK who asks, is being called thick an insult or compliment?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.920
I am five foot seven and 140 pounds.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.400
This guy called me thick saying he liked it, but all I hear from that is fat.

11:38.960 --> 11:45.520
I do have a donk large booty and muscular thighs,

11:45.520 --> 11:49.680
but I have no curves in my boobs and not really large hips.

11:49.680 --> 11:53.120
So is being called thick a compliment or insult?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.640
I simply can't do this.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.920
I can't Griffin.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.240
I'm trying to stay posy.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.240
I'm trying to march into positivity this.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.800
I have been the entire time you were reading that question.

12:06.800 --> 12:12.640
I was trying to, in my mind, formulate a sentence in which thick could be said in a complimentary

12:12.640 --> 12:12.960
way.

12:12.960 --> 12:13.440
I'm going to go.

12:14.080 --> 12:14.800
You know what?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.400
I think it's complimentary.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.280
Yeah, say it, say it and use it in a sentence.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.200
Travis, you're a real thick guy.

12:23.200 --> 12:23.520
Nope.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.520
Let me try that.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.000
Let me try that.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.120
You kind of look like Alan Thicke.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.000
Oh, that's pretty good, right?

12:32.000 --> 12:32.320
Uh huh.

12:33.520 --> 12:43.520
Listen, thick could mean that like the stuff of which you are constituted is is rigid.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.160
You know, it's like commenting on my density.

12:46.160 --> 12:52.160
Yeah, you can't be you can't be just blown over, you know, and you can't be swayed because

12:52.160 --> 12:56.080
you're you're made from from really hardy stock.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.760
Yeah, you're viscous.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.560
You're you're sturdy, sturdy.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.440
That's good.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.400
Reinforced.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.080
You are a reinforced person.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.480
You're like a McDonald's triple thick milkshake and you're like you get it and you're like,

13:10.480 --> 13:10.960
oh, great.

13:10.960 --> 13:15.120
I'm really going to enjoy this in 30 minutes when it's right when it's sippable through

13:15.120 --> 13:15.680
the straw.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.760
You are like right when it comes out the window.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.320
I see fresh out the window.

13:21.200 --> 13:26.880
When you were just reading that letter, I had a I sort of had this like an animated

13:26.880 --> 13:31.360
character in my mind that was that was supposed to change its appearance as you read the

13:31.360 --> 13:33.920
descriptions because I was building a mental picture.

13:33.920 --> 13:34.080
Sure.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.800
It just started at one and just kind of stayed there like, oh, OK.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.080
Yeah, you look like that.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.920
That's that's understandable.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.200
Maybe you have other gifts.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.080
Maybe maybe these aren't the gifts you should worry about.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.680
Is it possible this person is a dollar and that's what the person meant?

13:49.680 --> 13:50.240
Like you're thick.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, obviously.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.600
Well, but the guy said he liked it.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.680
So like I like you're so fucking dumb and I love it.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.960
I love you for it.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.160
You do have a donk large booty and I can't.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.160
I do love your donk large booty.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.280
What does that mean?

14:07.280 --> 14:07.920
I don't know.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.280
I have that's like that's like the Starbucks size above Venti.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.600
She didn't hyphenate.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.800
She didn't have a donk large mocha frap.

14:17.600 --> 14:24.400
I almost wish that she had hyphenated donk large as if donk was a modifier for large.

14:24.960 --> 14:29.120
And then I could use that term to describe other things like what?

14:29.760 --> 14:35.520
So is it donk large and donk medium and donk small or is just donk height in the adjective?

14:35.520 --> 14:37.280
So it's like, man, I'm donk thirsty.

14:37.280 --> 14:37.520
Yeah.

14:37.520 --> 14:42.160
I don't think anything can be donk small.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.160
Yeah, no, pretty sure.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.560
Well, except I wish that were true.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.240
That would that would mean a lot to my marital happiness.

14:51.280 --> 14:51.920
Wait, why?

14:52.560 --> 14:53.280
What?

14:53.280 --> 14:54.160
Because he's my dog.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.120
Because my dog's small.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.840
What do you mean?

14:57.840 --> 14:59.120
Donk like you can't.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.120
I just invented a new nomenclature for the gag.

15:03.120 --> 15:06.480
So when you say donk, you're either referring to your butt or your penis.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.040
Yes.

15:07.040 --> 15:13.680
So if donk became penis, it changes the song honky tonk but donk donk to a whole new level.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.000
Yeah, it's a really weird.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.320
Honky tonk but penis but penis.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.920
That hit song that he has.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.200
Oh, girl.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.680
Girl, you have many strengths.

15:26.720 --> 15:31.920
You literally have a lot of I mean, just just pure leg strength.

15:31.920 --> 15:32.880
Just pure.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.520
I bet you're really good at like lifting things.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.480
Powerlifting.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.760
You have that going for you.

15:39.440 --> 15:43.920
You're not very good at finding online forums to ask questions in because you pick the worst one.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.560
But that that that can't stop you.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.520
Don't slow down.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.720
Is saying someone has lifter's legs a compliment?

15:52.000 --> 15:55.200
If I call a lady sturdy, is that all right?

15:55.200 --> 15:56.480
That's not all right.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.680
No, no, it's not all right.

15:58.480 --> 16:03.120
Sturdy sounds like a phrase you use to describe a woman in the Dust Bowl.

16:03.120 --> 16:07.040
Oh, she said she's a she's a hardy woman.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.160
Hardy stock in her Hardy stock.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.040
I'm going to go buy her a larder of Calico.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.440
She is Hardy.

16:16.240 --> 16:23.760
Hey, if I if I want to buy a larder Calico, the only way I'm going to do it is by the support

16:23.760 --> 16:26.080
of Max fun listeners for Max fun drive.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.600
I know you guys are dying to hear about it.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.000
Let's let's pop it off.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.720
Griffin, give me the big pitch before we get into specifics.

16:32.720 --> 16:33.360
Why do we do this?

16:34.400 --> 16:35.280
We do it.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.600
It's not just us.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.480
When you when you support us for the Max fund drive, you're supporting us.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.440
You're supporting Jordan, Jesse, go just John Hodgman.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.600
Stop podcasting yourself throwing shade.

16:45.600 --> 16:53.440
All these these great programs that are totally free on the Max fund network, which are funded.

16:53.440 --> 16:58.480
I would say only slightly by the promotions and money zone stuff that we do, but like

16:58.480 --> 17:06.160
like almost all of it comes from listener donations, which is unbelievably radical.

17:06.720 --> 17:12.240
Since we joined the network last year and started getting the donations from the Max

17:12.240 --> 17:19.600
fund drive, we've been able to grow and do live shows and add more podcasts to the network.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.800
So so that is why we do it.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.960
We really appreciate your support.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.560
Here is how it works.

17:26.560 --> 17:34.240
You go to maximum fun dot org forward slash donate and you're going to have a few different

17:34.240 --> 17:37.040
options there for for your donation.

17:37.040 --> 17:43.600
Our lowest level, which is is just our least expensive level, it no in no way changes how

17:43.600 --> 17:49.840
much we care about you for for making this choice is five dollars.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.760
And that's all I mean, five dollars a month.

17:51.760 --> 17:56.960
And you can do something really great for well for us and also for yourself because

17:56.960 --> 18:00.080
you're helping to support great stuff.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.160
Travis, obviously, when someone donates, they're going to get the gift of entertainment.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.360
They're going to get the gift of feeling good about themselves.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.000
What else can we offer them?

18:10.000 --> 18:15.360
Well, at some of the beginning levels, five dollars a month, the biggest thing you get

18:15.360 --> 18:17.040
you get bonus episodes.

18:17.040 --> 18:20.400
So you get access to content that nobody else gets to see.

18:20.400 --> 18:24.560
You're going to get special episodes with Jordan, Jesse Goh, Judge John Hodgman, Stop

18:24.560 --> 18:28.960
Podcasting Yourself, My Brother, My Brother and Me and the new one, Throwing Shade, along

18:28.960 --> 18:34.960
with three Rift movies where we take some of like the old, you know, educational films

18:34.960 --> 18:36.240
and just mock them.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.680
You you will you will want to hear our bonus episode.

18:39.680 --> 18:45.600
Yeah, it's a special episode has a super special guest at the ten dollar level.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.960
You'll receive Max Fund Friendship bracelets.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.840
Bracelets along with all the content.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.120
You'll get the friendship bracelet and it's a way to show the world that you're a friend

18:55.120 --> 18:55.920
to Max Fund.

18:55.920 --> 19:01.360
It's like when you wear a carnation on a date, you will be able to recognize rad people

19:02.000 --> 19:04.160
by just by one glance at their wrist.

19:04.160 --> 19:10.400
Think of it as like a w w m b m b a m d bracelet.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.040
A j j go a j j h o.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.760
Keep all those characters in your head at once.

19:15.760 --> 19:20.160
That's so these thank you gifts apply only to new monthly donors.

19:20.160 --> 19:24.560
If you're a recurring member whom we love so very much, you're still going to get the

19:24.560 --> 19:25.360
bonus content.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.480
And if you're at the ten dollar level or above, you're still going to get the the Max Fund

19:28.480 --> 19:29.440
Friendship bracelet.

19:29.440 --> 19:33.520
But for all of the levels that are higher, you will need to increase your monthly membership

19:33.520 --> 19:35.920
level to get those thank you gifts.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.520
I really like maximum fun.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.480
I love m b m b a m.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.120
I love throwing shade the new program.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.320
I want to I want to give twenty dollars, thirty five dollars.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.280
I can do that.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.120
Well, let me throw this phrase out to you, Justin.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.080
The Diamond Friendship Circle.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.880
Diamonds are the best gym that there is.

19:54.880 --> 19:59.040
You can join the Diamond Friendship Circle and you'll receive a shiny new stainless steel

19:59.040 --> 20:03.360
water bottle and a handy on the go size screen printed with our simple and tasteful rocket

20:03.360 --> 20:04.160
logo.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.680
You also get the friendship bracelet, all the content, the rift tracks.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.680
Let's go back to the comedy for a little while.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.720
And then after that, we're going to talk about the thirty five dollar level.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.360
And it's really going to take it's really going to take your breath away.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.960
Oh, it'll be like that, like an audible gasp.

20:16.960 --> 20:24.000
You can read about all of the donation levels and gifts and everything you get for supporting

20:24.000 --> 20:27.040
us at Maximum Fund dot org slash donate.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.160
Please go check it out.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.560
We really do need your help to keep growing the show.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.120
And we really appreciate it.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.800
What's the best way to inquire to a potential employer about a job?

20:38.800 --> 20:43.040
I am doing everything I can think of to get this potential employer's attention and make

20:43.040 --> 20:45.440
me a valuable asset for the company in the future.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.160
How often is too often to inquire?

20:48.160 --> 20:50.320
I just do not want to be forgotten.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.920
This particular job is something that would revolutionize my life.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.840
It is something I would want to put my all into.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.440
That's from Aaron in New Zealand.

21:00.400 --> 21:04.720
I think we were raised every time that I ever applied for a job or anything.

21:04.720 --> 21:10.960
Mom and Dad always encouraged me to like call, you know, and check and be like, hey, so I

21:10.960 --> 21:16.320
was just following up on my application and resume and whatnot.

21:16.320 --> 21:20.240
Now, that being said, eventually, when I became the person that was interviewing people for

21:20.240 --> 21:22.160
jobs, I hate that shit.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.760
Yeah, God bless it.

21:23.760 --> 21:29.120
It's so terrible, especially when they call like the next day and you're like, I haven't

21:29.120 --> 21:31.600
even thought about you in 12 hours.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.560
Give me some time.

21:32.560 --> 21:39.520
The fact is, the fact of the matter is, you got to make that big first impression.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.520
You don't get another chance if you make the right first impression.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.680
And I'm not talking with a cold application.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.200
I'm talking about, you know, with an interview or whatever.

21:50.800 --> 21:54.160
You got to make that big first impression because if you do it right, it'll make that

21:54.160 --> 21:56.720
person, they won't be able to stop thinking about you.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.920
It'll be all they think about.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.400
They'll want you to come over and braid hair and stuff.

22:00.400 --> 22:05.680
You got to get that first impression rose, which is, of course, the rose that you get

22:05.680 --> 22:07.600
on the first episode of The Bachelor.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.640
We can't talk about The Bachelor anymore.

22:10.640 --> 22:14.560
Before he fucking like talks to, this is what I love about his show, before that dude talks

22:14.560 --> 22:20.080
to anyone on any substantial level, he gives someone a rose like, yeah, you can stick around,

22:20.080 --> 22:26.800
just based on like how they hit him, how the light catches them when he first sees them.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.600
Like, ah, yeah, she'll do.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.080
She'll, yeah, she's great.

22:32.080 --> 22:32.400
I love her.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.280
She's a sturdy woman.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.200
She came in on a horse.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.400
She could stay.

22:38.240 --> 22:43.040
They do something similar on Flavor of Love, except Flavor Flav does a can of beans in

22:43.040 --> 22:43.360
her face.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.560
It's not a classy show.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.320
It's my first impression, beans.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.520
Please help me be relevant.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.760
I'm forever slipping over that press.

22:53.760 --> 22:57.520
That show has been on in the last five years, right?

22:59.360 --> 23:00.720
I think it's still being recorded.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.080
It's just not airing anymore.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.040
It's just called his life now.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.800
It's just his day to day.

23:07.920 --> 23:12.960
I mean, I think one follow up is like, you should be able to get a pretty good vibe from

23:12.960 --> 23:13.200
it.

23:13.200 --> 23:20.560
If they're stalling you, then I think that, yeah, but I think it should be the same as

23:20.560 --> 23:23.760
like the getting a girl's number, getting a guy's number.

23:23.760 --> 23:30.400
It's like, don't call like that day or the next day because it's probably an interview

23:30.400 --> 23:33.520
process where they're interviewing more than one person for the job.

23:33.520 --> 23:36.000
So they're probably not all taking place on the same day.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.560
So give it like four or five days.

23:39.760 --> 23:44.240
Why don't you watch the TV show The Pickup Artist and then use the skills that you learned

23:44.240 --> 23:46.880
from that show on your potential employer?

23:46.880 --> 23:48.560
You know, Griffin, you joke.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.680
But as someone that's interviewed like countless people.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.520
You like to be seduced.

23:54.320 --> 23:56.720
Interview skills have so much to do with that.

23:56.720 --> 24:02.080
It's the personality, eye contact, being engaged, you know, like answering the questions that's

24:02.080 --> 24:04.800
asked you, being prepared, all of that dressing the part.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.560
Don't roll up in jeans and a t-shirt.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.200
Yeah, that's actually really important.

24:09.200 --> 24:14.080
Don't go, don't go turn in a job application if you're not dressed classy.

24:14.080 --> 24:14.880
Just like a gentleman.

24:14.880 --> 24:18.400
But don't overdress either if you're going to like a retail establishment and you wear

24:18.400 --> 24:20.560
like a suit and tie, the people are going to think you're making fun of them.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.960
That is the first thing they tell you on The Pickup Artist.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.280
Dress over but not under, but not too over.

24:27.840 --> 24:31.600
I think it's like, it's sort of like with sales or anything.

24:32.160 --> 24:36.320
Don't check in just to sort of keep yourself top of mind.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.640
Check in with an intention.

24:39.200 --> 24:43.040
Check in and say like, I'm going to move this process forward.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.920
Process forward or die trying.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.120
So don't call and say like, Hey, I just want to remind you I'm alive.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.360
I wanted to call and get this interview.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.320
Let's get this set up.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.240
Cause I know you want to move on this with me.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.880
I know you're into this as much as I am.

24:56.880 --> 25:01.600
Cause if you show that kind of enthusiasm that says like, Hey, let's book this job.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.240
Let's do this.

25:02.240 --> 25:02.640
I like it.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.720
You're looking thick in those jeans.

25:04.720 --> 25:05.920
Who's your friend?

25:05.920 --> 25:08.560
I'm not interested in you anymore, but now I am.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.440
You want to drink?

25:09.440 --> 25:09.920
Come here.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.560
Is that a direct quote from the pickup artist, Griffin?

25:12.560 --> 25:14.320
That's actually the poster catchphrase.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.520
How is that a gift?

25:17.520 --> 25:18.640
What is on the poster?

25:18.640 --> 25:20.640
You look thick in those jeans.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.680
Who's your friend?

25:21.680 --> 25:23.040
I'm bored with you now.

25:23.040 --> 25:23.840
Now I'm not.

25:23.840 --> 25:24.960
You want to drink?

25:24.960 --> 25:26.640
Come here now.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.240
Eight o'clock on a TV.

25:30.000 --> 25:30.800
Mystery.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.120
Mystery.

25:31.120 --> 25:31.600
Come get it.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.400
Pickup artist.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.920
Have you seen the hat that guy wears?

25:33.920 --> 25:34.960
It's the best hat.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.960
You got an Excalibur.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.320
It's true.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

25:40.880 --> 25:41.120
Yeah.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.480
This Yahoo was sent in by Catherine Burgess.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.280
Thank you, Catherine.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Waldo, who asks,

25:48.400 --> 25:51.600
is it possible to marry someone without them knowing?

25:52.800 --> 25:54.000
Oh, no.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.680
Like get them to sign a paper saying you're married without them actually being aware

25:57.680 --> 25:59.520
you're actually getting married.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.920
What if you've actually never met this person?

26:01.920 --> 26:07.200
I want to marry Liam Payne from One Direction, but I've never actually met him before.

26:07.200 --> 26:11.760
And if I ever do meet him, could I have him sign like an autograph that's actually marriage

26:11.760 --> 26:12.320
papers?

26:12.320 --> 26:12.640
How?

26:13.440 --> 26:15.920
Also, how do you cure a phobia of spoons?

26:18.160 --> 26:18.640
What?

26:19.520 --> 26:20.560
Additional details.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.720
I don't have a fear of spoons.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.400
It's Liam's phobia, duh.

26:24.960 --> 26:28.320
I think maybe if I can help him cure this, then he'll marry me.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.640
Also, congrats on your marriage to Neil Patrick Harris.

26:30.640 --> 26:31.600
I heard he's gay now.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.260
What?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.620
Who hold?

26:36.740 --> 26:37.460
Wait.

26:37.460 --> 26:40.180
I don't know where to start.

26:40.180 --> 26:41.940
There's so much going on.

26:41.940 --> 26:42.660
There's so many.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.820
First off, who is Liam Payne?

26:46.820 --> 26:48.020
Who was One Direction?

26:48.020 --> 26:50.580
Is that the fucking Glee Club on Glee?

26:50.580 --> 26:51.380
Oh, wait.

26:51.380 --> 26:52.020
No way.

26:52.020 --> 26:52.580
Is it?

26:52.580 --> 26:53.380
No, no, no, no.

26:53.380 --> 26:54.820
It's a British boy band.

26:54.820 --> 26:55.940
Oh, thank God.

26:55.940 --> 26:56.900
Wait, is that better?

26:57.540 --> 26:59.780
It's like take that or the Beatles.

26:59.780 --> 27:03.620
These guys are the famousest and I've never heard of them.

27:04.900 --> 27:05.940
How famous are they?

27:05.940 --> 27:07.060
Can't be that famous.

27:07.700 --> 27:08.820
Is it spelled right?

27:08.820 --> 27:15.220
Or is it spelled like w-o-n-d-i-r-e-z something?

27:15.220 --> 27:17.460
Guys, you guys are my metric for this stuff though.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.460
Like I'm 31 years old.

27:19.460 --> 27:22.340
If something's huge and I haven't heard of it, I'm out.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.540
I'm out the game.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.460
There's five of these little creeps.

27:25.460 --> 27:29.380
And there is a Daily Mail article that the headline for which is

27:29.380 --> 27:34.260
One Direction to have 20 bodyguards each for their Dallas performance.

27:34.260 --> 27:36.500
And it only lasts 45 minutes.

27:36.500 --> 27:37.940
That's not a very good headline though.

27:38.820 --> 27:41.780
These fools look like they're like 12.

27:41.780 --> 27:44.580
They've got 20 fucking bodyguards each.

27:45.860 --> 27:47.540
And they've all got to learn the dances.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.420
This is ridiculous.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.300
It's the tough part.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.260
So this girl wants to marry.

27:55.460 --> 27:58.260
Let's just say Davy Jones so I can wrap my mind around it.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.500
Well, a live Davy Jones in his prime.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.140
Okay, okay.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.060
She wants to marry a live.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.660
That's something from my time period.

28:04.660 --> 28:08.500
So I can relate to wants to marry leave leave Gallagher.

28:09.140 --> 28:10.580
Is that like I leave Garrett?

28:12.660 --> 28:14.020
I love you leave Garrett.

28:15.380 --> 28:16.500
I love you leave Garrett.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.740
I'm sorry you are so bummed about spoons.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.260
I'm not crazy about them either.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.700
Can we get some sports up in here?

28:22.420 --> 28:26.820
Like I will never serve you soup till death do us part.

28:26.820 --> 28:27.540
I promise.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.420
I love you.

28:28.420 --> 28:31.060
You are missing the best part of this question.

28:31.780 --> 28:32.740
What is that?

28:32.740 --> 28:35.220
The vehicle, the mode, the method,

28:35.220 --> 28:38.100
which this person could take to get a signature on a marriage license.

28:38.100 --> 28:38.740
You're right.

28:38.740 --> 28:41.060
You're right there.

28:41.060 --> 28:44.660
I mean, I need you to sign for this package.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.740
You can do the classic full house,

28:46.740 --> 28:54.260
like scoot up the front page on the science fair form, you know,

28:54.260 --> 28:55.380
and then they sign it.

28:55.380 --> 28:57.460
It's like, oh, field trip to Rome.

28:58.260 --> 28:59.380
Like, that's a good one.

28:59.380 --> 29:00.260
Come on, Comet.

29:00.820 --> 29:01.320
Bye.

29:02.100 --> 29:02.600
Ciao.

29:03.460 --> 29:05.060
I'm riding you out of here, Comet.

29:07.140 --> 29:10.100
I pretended, by the way, just now that Comet was a luck dragon.

29:10.100 --> 29:10.740
Sorry.

29:10.740 --> 29:16.900
You can't trick someone into marrying you, Baba Yaga.

29:16.900 --> 29:18.500
That's not how that shit works.

29:19.700 --> 29:20.660
You trickster.

29:22.100 --> 29:22.820
You knave.

29:22.820 --> 29:25.940
What sound would that person make if it worked?

29:25.940 --> 29:29.860
Would it just be like an audible sort of, whoop, we're married.

29:30.580 --> 29:33.380
Wait, the person who's been tricked or the trickster?

29:34.260 --> 29:35.620
Oh, the trickster.

29:35.620 --> 29:40.980
The person who's been tricked is into indentured servitude for the rest of his life.

29:41.540 --> 29:44.260
She would probably just yell like, I'm your wife now.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.620
And then one of these fools, 20 bodyguards would murder her.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.140
Just like, take the shot right there.

29:49.140 --> 29:51.460
And then he would be a very young popular widow.

29:51.460 --> 29:52.180
Popular widow.

29:53.140 --> 29:55.060
I'm the most famous widow that there is.

29:55.860 --> 30:01.300
The only way you can separate yourself from the rest of new direction choices,

30:01.300 --> 30:05.140
the rest of their bodyguards, is by killing a fan that gets out of line.

30:05.140 --> 30:07.540
Because people are going to remember that kind of dedication.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.620
That's why you carry one of them out.

30:09.620 --> 30:11.380
You think this is the first time this has happened?

30:12.820 --> 30:14.420
A bodyguard killed a fan?

30:14.420 --> 30:15.620
No, I think it happens a lot.

30:15.620 --> 30:17.220
No, I mean secret marriage.

30:17.220 --> 30:19.300
A secret, a fan gets a secret marriage.

30:19.300 --> 30:23.460
Do you know Justin Timberlake is like fucking Cody from Sister Wives?

30:23.460 --> 30:25.620
Because he's got like 20 secret wives.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.780
And that fool will sign anything.

30:27.780 --> 30:29.380
Yeah, sign anything for you.

30:29.940 --> 30:32.100
JT, you have to stop signing things.

30:32.820 --> 30:35.540
Why would you, why would you get to sign a baseball card?

30:35.540 --> 30:36.820
You don't even play baseball.

30:36.820 --> 30:37.700
What are you doing?

30:37.700 --> 30:39.540
I saw these people in my house.

30:39.540 --> 30:40.900
I signed it away.

30:40.900 --> 30:43.300
Nope, just getting punked by my good friend Ashton Kutcher.

30:44.740 --> 30:45.780
That was a real episode.

30:47.140 --> 30:48.100
That, what?

30:48.100 --> 30:49.460
That was a real episode of punk.

30:49.460 --> 30:52.740
Did he sign his, did he sign his, signed a fake wedding?

30:52.740 --> 31:00.180
No, he's, I think, uh, uh, a coach, uh, just rolled up in, in J Tim's house.

31:00.180 --> 31:02.820
And like, it started like taking all his shit away.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.780
And he's like, it's fine, man.

31:03.780 --> 31:04.740
You got repossessed.

31:05.620 --> 31:07.460
It's not, it's not really germane.

31:07.460 --> 31:08.180
Let's move on.

31:10.420 --> 31:12.020
No, no, Griffin, continue.

31:12.020 --> 31:13.220
How's the girl play out?

31:13.780 --> 31:14.740
By all means.

31:14.740 --> 31:18.180
Yeah, he's like, no, I don't hate.

31:18.180 --> 31:18.900
That's my car.

31:19.940 --> 31:24.980
And he takes his car and I gotcha sign this.

31:27.140 --> 31:29.780
That was the name of the show on MTV at eight coaches.

31:29.780 --> 31:30.340
I gotcha.

31:31.460 --> 31:34.180
Sign this, sign this, sign this, please.

31:35.220 --> 31:38.100
They're, they probably actually did have to sign his affidavit.

31:38.660 --> 31:38.980
Oops.

31:38.980 --> 31:39.780
We're married.

31:39.780 --> 31:40.580
Gotcha.

31:40.580 --> 31:41.220
Again.

31:41.220 --> 31:41.940
Sign this now.

31:41.940 --> 31:45.300
Sign another affidavit.

31:45.300 --> 31:47.380
Why does he keep falling for it?

31:47.380 --> 31:48.100
That's my question.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.540
He's not very smart.

31:49.540 --> 31:52.340
No, but God damn, he can dance and act.

31:53.700 --> 31:57.140
And well, dance and sing and sing.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.820
He's a triple threat.

31:58.820 --> 31:59.460
Stop signing.

31:59.460 --> 32:00.420
Stop signing shit.

32:00.420 --> 32:03.060
He can't be legally, fiscally responsible.

32:04.580 --> 32:08.660
That's why he's his own, um, he has lost his own power of attorney.

32:08.660 --> 32:12.820
He actually cannot sign any, it's not legally binding.

32:12.820 --> 32:15.860
If he signs it, it has to be his manager, Lou Pearlman.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.980
I don't, uh, what?

32:18.980 --> 32:20.020
No, go on.

32:20.020 --> 32:20.420
You're right.

32:20.420 --> 32:23.060
No, no, you're right about everything you just said.

32:23.060 --> 32:27.300
Hey guys, how do I break up with my D and D party?

32:27.860 --> 32:30.900
I'm really busy and I haven't been having much fun lately.

32:30.900 --> 32:31.940
I like my friends.

32:31.940 --> 32:37.060
My dwarf is kind of a big part of the party, but I don't have the time to play.

32:37.060 --> 32:39.060
And I don't know how to end it.

32:39.060 --> 32:39.940
Please help.

32:39.940 --> 32:41.140
And that's from Badkins.

32:41.700 --> 32:42.740
Hi, Badkins.

32:42.740 --> 32:43.220
Hello, Badkins.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.700
First off, Badkins, why don't you invite me to your group?

32:45.700 --> 32:46.420
I'm in Huntington.

32:46.420 --> 32:47.540
You're in Huntington.

32:47.540 --> 32:48.340
Let's do this.

32:49.620 --> 32:50.420
Let's quest.

32:51.060 --> 32:52.100
Let's quest together.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.140
Badkins, the answer is so obvious.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.980
It's right in front of your face.

32:56.980 --> 33:00.740
It is time for your dwarf to start playing fast and move.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.660
That's exactly what I was going to say.

33:02.660 --> 33:05.060
Live like you were dying or want to die.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.660
Is that how that, is that what that song's about?

33:06.660 --> 33:10.900
Have you seen this Jeff Bridges movie Fearless that's been going around lately?

33:13.060 --> 33:14.260
That's the life you're living.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.660
You're just standing on the edge of buildings.

33:16.660 --> 33:19.620
Like anytime there's a dragon, you're like, hey, fuck you.

33:20.900 --> 33:22.340
I'm going to solo it.

33:22.340 --> 33:22.840
Yeah.

33:24.740 --> 33:24.740
Eat me up.

33:24.740 --> 33:25.780
Every few minutes.

33:25.780 --> 33:26.500
Every few minutes.

33:27.140 --> 33:34.100
And my dwarf wakes up from his bed and wanders off into a cave, bringing no armaments with him.

33:34.100 --> 33:35.220
No, he doesn't.

33:35.220 --> 33:36.660
No, he doesn't, Badkins.

33:36.660 --> 33:37.300
He doesn't.

33:38.340 --> 33:39.140
He doesn't do that.

33:39.140 --> 33:41.300
No, I'm pretty sure he does.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.020
This is what happened.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.060
Or he puts all of his armor on, walks into the lake.

33:45.060 --> 33:45.560
Oops.

33:46.820 --> 33:52.340
Or how about a completely like non-tragic turn where your dwarf retires from adventuring

33:52.340 --> 33:54.820
to start a life as a blacksmith.

33:54.820 --> 34:00.260
And while your group continues to play in the dungeon, you're off playing a separate

34:00.260 --> 34:03.300
game of balancing the books for your blacksmithery.

34:03.300 --> 34:06.660
And trying to keep some food on your family's table.

34:07.220 --> 34:08.100
He's out the game.

34:08.100 --> 34:08.980
He's out the game.

34:08.980 --> 34:09.620
He can't do this anymore.

34:09.620 --> 34:14.580
Dwarf dies of natural causes that you hint at.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.140
My dwarf's brain feels funny.

34:19.220 --> 34:21.220
My dwarf smells burnt toast.

34:21.220 --> 34:23.140
It's nothing to worry about for a while.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.860
The left side of my dwarf's face is numb.

34:27.540 --> 34:28.260
This is weird.

34:28.260 --> 34:31.940
My dwarf has just gotten a note from the doctor that says it's malignant.

34:31.940 --> 34:33.620
And no, he didn't.

34:33.620 --> 34:34.820
He didn't do that.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.260
I'm the dungeon master.

34:36.260 --> 34:39.140
You can't just make up notes that your dwarf gets.

34:39.140 --> 34:40.260
My cleric heals you.

34:40.260 --> 34:42.820
Oh, it's, it's immagicable.

34:44.100 --> 34:47.220
It's immagicable.

34:47.220 --> 34:48.580
My dwarf can't stop peeing.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.380
Is that trouble?

34:51.380 --> 34:52.900
Do I need to see somebody for that?

34:52.900 --> 34:53.940
A magic doctor.

34:53.940 --> 34:54.740
What's that?

34:54.740 --> 34:56.260
You do not actually have doctors?

34:57.380 --> 34:59.060
That's, that's pretty scary.

34:59.060 --> 35:00.100
I guess I'm going to die then.

35:00.100 --> 35:02.020
Then you've got to kill him off.

35:02.020 --> 35:06.180
If you kill him off, then you can't, then he can't be around on the adventures anymore.

35:06.180 --> 35:07.220
That's pretty obvious, right?

35:08.020 --> 35:12.580
But I think the bigger problem is now you can't tell people in your group to listen to our show.

35:13.620 --> 35:17.700
And, and I don't think you really thought about the repercussions first before you did this.

35:18.660 --> 35:21.060
Um, Justin, would you be up for a swap-a-roo?

35:21.060 --> 35:22.420
A swap-a-rooney?

35:22.420 --> 35:24.500
He taps in, he taps out, you tap in.

35:25.460 --> 35:28.980
I will take over as Grizzlethorne Beerbelly or whatever the fuck.

35:28.980 --> 35:30.820
I will be your dwarf now.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.620
I will take over.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.460
You're a sickly, sickly dwarf.

35:33.460 --> 35:37.620
You're a sickly, decrepit disease.

35:37.620 --> 35:38.820
He lost another tooth.

35:38.820 --> 35:39.620
Lost another tooth.

35:40.820 --> 35:41.380
Damn it.

35:41.380 --> 35:44.340
Guys, I have to stop and put on my robe.

35:46.180 --> 35:47.220
It's not magical.

35:47.220 --> 35:48.420
It's just terry cloth.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.620
He's caught a chill.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.540
I've got to chill.

35:51.540 --> 35:52.500
I have to sit down.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.980
Can we, can we rest please?

35:54.980 --> 35:56.660
Can we please just take a break?

35:56.660 --> 35:57.620
I'm so tired.

35:57.620 --> 36:01.620
Um, the party notices that my dwarf has been having prolonged conversations with people

36:01.620 --> 36:04.580
he cares about and trying to give them things he owns.

36:04.580 --> 36:05.940
Is that, is that a problem?

36:07.780 --> 36:09.460
You hit for one damage again.

36:10.020 --> 36:11.220
What's wrong with your bones?

36:13.780 --> 36:16.340
I'd like to roll to see if the treatment is working.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.060
Oh no.

36:17.060 --> 36:18.100
Nah, critical miss.

36:18.660 --> 36:18.900
Bye.

36:20.580 --> 36:21.140
Critical miss.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.700
Just, will you guys just name a sword after me?

36:23.700 --> 36:25.620
Just, just remember me some way.

36:25.620 --> 36:30.500
Keep me in your heart for a while, uh, and just, and wait an appropriate amount of time

36:30.500 --> 36:32.260
before you hire another dwarf, please.

36:32.980 --> 36:33.380
Please.

36:34.180 --> 36:38.340
And now, uh, I'll do the sad hulk walking away music.

36:38.340 --> 36:43.700
I want you guys to remember me as I was, not as I am and not as this disease will make me.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.020
I'm going to go spend some time with my clan.

36:46.020 --> 36:53.140
I just had the horrifying realization that this thing we are goofing about is something

36:53.140 --> 36:58.020
that it's probably actually happened in a game of Dungeons and Dragons without, like,

36:58.020 --> 36:58.980
sans goofing.

36:59.620 --> 37:04.820
Like a real, someone tried to work like a natural death in their storyline and, like,

37:04.820 --> 37:08.180
had to, like, act it out to the point where, like, laying on the bed.

37:08.180 --> 37:10.740
Like, I've always loved.

37:10.740 --> 37:12.340
Oh, bye guys.

37:13.140 --> 37:14.020
Oh, my dad's here.

37:14.020 --> 37:15.140
My mom's here, I gotta go.

37:18.020 --> 37:19.220
I have a date, okay?

37:19.220 --> 37:20.500
I have a date.

37:20.500 --> 37:21.300
There, I know.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.980
I've been married for three years.

37:24.980 --> 37:26.580
I can't do this with you fools anymore.

37:27.860 --> 37:32.660
Please remember me as I was and make sure that you take my jewels back to my fake in-game wife.

37:33.220 --> 37:36.740
And save my character sheet and cryogenically freeze my fake body.

37:38.580 --> 37:40.580
God damn, I miss Dungeons and Dragons.

37:40.580 --> 37:42.340
Yeah, man, it's good.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.140
It's a good time.

37:43.140 --> 37:47.620
Can we start, like, a D&D podcast so I have an excuse to do this every week?

37:47.620 --> 37:49.780
Is this something we can do over the internet?

37:49.780 --> 37:53.140
Let's just turn this dumb show into a weekly D&D session.

37:53.940 --> 37:55.860
We don't need to do advice anymore.

37:55.860 --> 37:57.060
Let's fucking go on a quest.

37:57.060 --> 37:58.820
We can do D&D advice.

37:58.820 --> 37:59.140
Yeah.

37:59.140 --> 38:02.660
That's what our advice roll for initiative.

38:02.660 --> 38:09.620
Hey, we should do that as a bonus episode instead of our current plan.

38:10.180 --> 38:12.820
Or just play D&D together, make people listen to it.

38:12.820 --> 38:14.900
I mean, I got all the stuff if we need it.

38:16.100 --> 38:18.100
This is getting too close to reality.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.260
I want it to be on reality.

38:20.260 --> 38:21.700
I want it to be on and in it.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.740
Well, let's think about it.

38:22.740 --> 38:24.340
Let's not do anything too hasty.

38:24.340 --> 38:27.220
I don't want to rush into it and then later have to fake my own death.

38:27.220 --> 38:28.340
Oh, shit.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.460
Fake your own death.

38:30.660 --> 38:35.620
Die in the game, fake your death in the game, and then in, like, three months, smash into

38:35.620 --> 38:37.460
a window and be like, what's up?

38:37.460 --> 38:40.020
But smash it through your actual, like, friend's window.

38:40.580 --> 38:41.060
Yeah, right.

38:41.060 --> 38:41.620
No, no, no.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.980
Yeah, absolutely.

38:42.980 --> 38:45.220
But you got to work that out with the DM first.

38:45.220 --> 38:48.340
You got to say, listen, I'm going to fake my own death and I want you to conspire with me.

38:49.220 --> 38:50.500
Well, I'm bumming myself out.

38:52.740 --> 38:55.620
What if I love podcasts, right?

38:56.420 --> 38:56.740
Okay.

38:56.740 --> 39:03.620
And I say I have an extra $35 a month that I could donate to those podcasts to help them

39:03.620 --> 39:05.300
out, help keep the funny coming.

39:06.100 --> 39:07.780
What would you give me in exchange for that?

39:07.780 --> 39:10.980
Well, I would make a case that you shouldn't donate to any old podcast.

39:10.980 --> 39:16.100
You should donate to our podcast network, which is maximum fun.

39:16.980 --> 39:22.420
We have described the $5 and $10 and $20 levels.

39:23.460 --> 39:30.420
At $35 a month, it is the Judge John Hodgman's Post-Apocalyptic Justice Squad.

39:31.460 --> 39:35.540
For $35 a month, you get all this stuff we talked about before.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.780
You get the stainless steel water bottle.

39:37.780 --> 39:38.820
You get the friendship bracelet.

39:38.820 --> 39:41.380
You get all the donors-only episodes.

39:41.380 --> 39:44.100
Can't vouch for the quality of the rest, but ours is going to be totally dope.

39:45.060 --> 39:50.980
You also get our highly collectible, totally proprietary Friendship Emergency Kit,

39:50.980 --> 39:57.140
which includes MaxPhone playing cards, some Mad Libs, which is different from Sad Libs,

39:58.260 --> 40:02.740
two bubblegum cigars, two packets of Alka-Seltzer, two temporary tattoos,

40:02.740 --> 40:07.780
headphone splitters for your friends to share media, a box of Kashi Good Friends

40:07.780 --> 40:14.900
breakfast cereal, best friends' necklaces, and also a half bag of Tonks coffee.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.020
I'm sorry, I read that wrong.

40:16.020 --> 40:18.900
It's Donk Large Coffee.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.900
Yeah, Tonks coffee.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.500
Can you tell me about Tonks, Griffin?

40:22.500 --> 40:23.780
What is Tonks?

40:23.780 --> 40:24.900
I'm not familiar with the brand.

40:26.100 --> 40:30.900
I believe that is one of the wizards in Harry Potter with a lady wizard, right?

40:30.900 --> 40:33.700
Yep, that lady wizard went to make some coffee.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.700
She is a lady wizard and a cofiteer.

40:35.700 --> 40:41.140
Tonks is a coffee that gets delivered right to you, and it's fresh and delicious, right?

40:41.140 --> 40:45.780
And it's fresh roasted with care, so it's none of that stale stuff that sits on the

40:45.780 --> 40:48.020
shelves at supermarkets forever.

40:48.020 --> 40:49.060
It's fresh roasted.

40:49.060 --> 40:55.060
And it's not that bullshit, that bullshit shit that you put in, it's like a little cup,

40:55.060 --> 40:58.900
and you put the cup in the machine, and then it makes you a bigger cup of coffee.

40:58.900 --> 40:59.780
It makes Christ sad.

40:59.780 --> 41:01.540
And each one is like eight and a half dollars.

41:01.540 --> 41:06.100
Yeah, Tonks is like Netflix, but instead of getting movies in the mail, you get coffee

41:06.100 --> 41:06.660
to do it.

41:07.380 --> 41:09.620
But you get a free half bag of that also.

41:09.620 --> 41:13.060
So it's everything you basically need to survive an Arctic expedition.

41:13.060 --> 41:17.620
And we would really, really, really, the support means so much to us, guys, and it helps us

41:17.620 --> 41:22.020
to do this show and keep it running and do cool stuff like live shows and everything.

41:22.020 --> 41:23.140
And here's the important thing.

41:23.860 --> 41:29.380
When you donate, when you commit, when you support us, make sure that you tell them you're

41:29.380 --> 41:31.700
supporting my brother, my brother and me.

41:32.420 --> 41:38.180
Even if you don't like our show and you like the other shows better, we are Baptist, so

41:38.180 --> 41:41.460
we will guilt you in a way that you will not be comfortable with.

41:41.460 --> 41:45.780
If you don't support us with money, then we know that you don't love us.

41:47.220 --> 41:48.180
That's facts.

41:48.820 --> 41:49.780
That's facts.

41:49.780 --> 41:51.540
That's love in our house.

41:51.540 --> 41:54.020
Ladies and gentlemen, we're passing the hat.

41:54.020 --> 41:55.220
It's time for you to tithe.

41:55.220 --> 42:01.780
If 10 percent of you just take your monthly salary, divide by 10.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.060
Give us one of them.

42:03.060 --> 42:08.500
Let's move on to the third stanza of our of our podcast, as long as we're keeping the

42:09.300 --> 42:10.900
Baptist theme being back.

42:10.900 --> 42:13.060
This is so great to get all these jokes.

42:13.060 --> 42:18.020
Yeah, I have recently embarked on a year long personal crusade to shed a bunch of extra

42:18.020 --> 42:18.900
LBs.

42:18.900 --> 42:22.580
I've got a lot to lose, so I've broken it down into 20 pound milestones.

42:22.580 --> 42:24.180
So I have goals to plan against.

42:24.180 --> 42:25.780
And the first one is coming up soon.

42:25.780 --> 42:30.500
In general, I fit the heavy set ponytail bearded nerd stereotype.

42:30.500 --> 42:34.420
So recently had the idea I should probably mix it up each 20 pound milestone, cut my

42:34.420 --> 42:37.300
hair, shave my beard, start dressing a little nicer.

42:37.300 --> 42:42.820
Do you guys have any other ideas for potential me changers, health style or otherwise?

42:42.820 --> 42:45.540
That's trying to rock it in Rochester.

42:45.540 --> 42:47.460
First of all, good on you.

42:47.460 --> 42:48.340
Yeah, good on you.

42:48.340 --> 42:50.500
I love this question so much I could faint.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.180
Getting it in 20 does.

42:52.180 --> 42:54.980
Get that he does, you were getting it.

42:54.980 --> 43:03.220
Here is something that I and it's an attitude thing that I actually learned from from Jesse

43:03.220 --> 43:08.500
are our podcast down and have tried to sort of implement it in my day to day life.

43:08.500 --> 43:13.540
And it's that when you're talking about stuff for yourself, grooming, hygiene, style, whatever,

43:14.180 --> 43:20.500
sometimes the quickest, cheapest way, the most efficient way is not is not always the

43:20.500 --> 43:27.460
best because you're sending a signal to yourself that you the stuff for you is is is worth

43:27.460 --> 43:30.020
rushing through or is worth cheaping out on.

43:30.900 --> 43:35.780
For example, example here that I'm on board with is the is the wet shave.

43:35.780 --> 43:39.540
You use a brush, you do the foam, you use a safety razor.

43:39.540 --> 43:40.260
It's great.

43:40.260 --> 43:41.780
It's how old men did it.

43:41.780 --> 43:42.980
And it's how you could do it.

43:42.980 --> 43:45.140
And it and it's awesome because it takes a little longer.

43:46.260 --> 43:49.540
But it's it's also it also will save me some money in the long run.

43:49.540 --> 43:53.220
But it's a it's a real sort of like ritualistic way of approaching it.

43:53.220 --> 43:56.580
And it's not the fastest way or the easiest way.

43:56.580 --> 44:00.260
But it sends a message to yourself that, hey, I'm taking care of me.

44:00.260 --> 44:01.140
I'm worth it.

44:01.140 --> 44:06.980
And you're saying at every at this next upcoming 20 pound milestone, he starts he starts the

44:06.980 --> 44:07.940
wet shave.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.460
I say start the wet shave.

44:09.460 --> 44:14.100
Do a little research that you can look at to put this on the episode that that talks

44:14.100 --> 44:16.660
about I think the episode just about grooming in general.

44:16.660 --> 44:18.340
But it'll tell you how to wet shave.

44:18.340 --> 44:19.860
There's a lot of resources out there about it.

44:19.860 --> 44:20.900
But get into it.

44:20.900 --> 44:21.380
It's fun.

44:21.380 --> 44:25.700
And also make sure I love the physical appearance and caring about all that.

44:25.700 --> 44:29.300
Make sure that you're, you know, taking care of your mental self as well.

44:29.300 --> 44:36.180
So maybe on the next milestone, you try something, you know, food or beverage related that you've

44:36.180 --> 44:41.380
never tried before, something a little adventurous and maybe find that you have a great palette

44:41.380 --> 44:45.780
for wine or you really like Italian food, you know, something new.

44:45.780 --> 44:48.420
Wait, hold the fuck up, Travis.

44:48.420 --> 44:50.020
What are you are you saying?

44:50.020 --> 44:56.420
But as to reward yourself on this quest to lose weight, what you should get into is wine

44:56.420 --> 44:57.700
and Italian food.

44:57.700 --> 44:58.980
OK, let me strike that.

44:59.620 --> 45:00.100
Oh, yeah.

45:00.100 --> 45:01.060
I lost 60 pounds.

45:01.060 --> 45:03.540
Time to go to the O.G. and gain it all back.

45:04.100 --> 45:06.260
What about carb up and slurp down?

45:06.260 --> 45:08.100
I will have all the fujul.

45:08.980 --> 45:11.780
Let me see all the fujul that you got on your shelf.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.860
Well, just let me introduce myself.

45:13.860 --> 45:16.420
I'm fat again.

45:16.420 --> 45:18.020
Then can I say art?

45:19.540 --> 45:22.580
Yes, not only can you say art, you should have said art.

45:22.580 --> 45:26.180
I'm going to double back and say art.

45:26.180 --> 45:27.220
You can't.

45:27.220 --> 45:27.860
You can't.

45:27.860 --> 45:28.340
I can't.

45:28.340 --> 45:30.180
You guys edit out your shit all the time.

45:32.580 --> 45:33.540
He's right about that.

45:35.140 --> 45:36.100
He is not wrong.

45:36.100 --> 45:43.220
So let's say rather than food and beverage, let's say culture and maybe go to a museum

45:43.220 --> 45:48.660
or go to see a ballet or go to see a symphony, something, you know, that maybe you're not

45:48.660 --> 45:51.940
normally into and you just want to check out and see if maybe you dig it.

45:51.940 --> 45:54.500
You guys are thinking so small scale.

45:55.140 --> 45:57.700
I am I am amazed at you.

45:58.260 --> 46:00.180
This guy is offering us a chance.

46:00.180 --> 46:07.060
Every 20 pounds he loses, he can totally and completely reinvent his entire persona,

46:08.100 --> 46:10.420
so much so that his friends won't recognize him.

46:10.420 --> 46:16.740
Like you lose 20 pounds, cut your hair, shave your beard, wear sunglasses constantly and

46:16.740 --> 46:17.940
say your name is now Roz.

46:19.700 --> 46:20.980
Lose another 20 pounds.

46:22.020 --> 46:27.540
Maybe you go hit the tanning bed constantly and you bleach your teeth and then you change

46:27.540 --> 46:31.940
your name again to Brock or the Brock or the Mr.

46:31.940 --> 46:32.340
Mr.

46:32.340 --> 46:32.900
The Brock.

46:34.740 --> 46:37.620
And then next time you're going to be really fit.

46:37.620 --> 46:39.220
Maybe get that asshole bleach.

46:39.220 --> 46:40.900
Let's see if we can't get a porn career.

46:40.900 --> 46:42.020
Lose 40 pounds.

46:42.020 --> 46:42.980
Bleach that asshole.

46:42.980 --> 46:44.100
Regain 20.

46:45.460 --> 46:46.260
Where are you at now?

46:47.060 --> 46:49.540
Your friends don't know which side they're coming from.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.220
Lose 40 pounds of fat.

46:51.220 --> 46:53.620
Regain 20 pounds of fuck muscle.

46:53.620 --> 46:54.420
Get in there.

46:54.420 --> 46:55.140
What is that?

46:58.260 --> 46:59.540
It's what you use to thrust.

47:00.100 --> 47:01.460
It's the thrusters.

47:01.460 --> 47:03.380
Yeah, it's your thrusters.

47:04.020 --> 47:07.300
I just gotta get your thrusters going and your afterburners.

47:07.300 --> 47:09.700
I learned these.

47:09.700 --> 47:10.980
I'm going to take you to the hyper space.

47:10.980 --> 47:12.020
Try a barrel roll.

47:13.460 --> 47:14.660
Girl, I got bad news.

47:14.660 --> 47:15.780
Our shields are failing.

47:18.020 --> 47:18.820
Girl, girl.

47:18.820 --> 47:20.260
Fire up the tachyon cannons.

47:24.820 --> 47:25.460
Oh, man.

47:26.340 --> 47:29.220
I need some more dilithium crystals, by which I mean meth.

47:29.860 --> 47:34.020
Of course, in that case it would be fuck meth because it's the meth that you use for sex.

47:34.020 --> 47:39.460
I learned in school that every muscle is a fuck muscle or you're just not doing it right.

47:40.740 --> 47:42.420
What class was that in?

47:42.420 --> 47:44.260
What school were you going to?

47:44.260 --> 47:44.980
Health school.

47:45.780 --> 47:46.500
Health school.

47:47.060 --> 47:47.940
You dummy.

47:48.820 --> 47:54.500
So, I'm excited about this man in the midst of a change.

47:54.500 --> 47:56.180
If you want to, keep us updated.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.260
Yeah, keep us updated.

47:58.260 --> 47:59.860
Let us know what your current name is.

48:00.820 --> 48:01.700
In fact, you know what?

48:01.700 --> 48:03.620
I'm going to lay it out there more.

48:05.060 --> 48:08.100
I'm giving this man the greatest gift, which is accountability.

48:08.740 --> 48:16.100
If you don't send us pictures of you as you continue to lose 20 pounds and how you're reinventing.

48:16.100 --> 48:17.140
Fully clothed.

48:17.140 --> 48:18.420
I can't stress this enough.

48:18.980 --> 48:20.980
Then you will have failed us.

48:21.780 --> 48:23.700
We're giving you the gift of accountability.

48:23.700 --> 48:24.980
We need you to get fit.

48:26.180 --> 48:26.740
Roz.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.180
And to bleach that asshole.

48:28.980 --> 48:29.940
Don't show us that one.

48:29.940 --> 48:30.500
Roz.

48:30.500 --> 48:33.860
Don't show us that you can tell us about the asshole and we'll trust you.

48:33.860 --> 48:35.620
Show us a receipt for the procedure.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.180
Unless it depicts an asshole.

48:40.100 --> 48:41.140
I don't know why it would.

48:42.100 --> 48:43.540
Is this your business card?

48:43.540 --> 48:44.900
That's disgusting.

48:44.900 --> 48:48.820
Going over his transcript, it looks like he did just spend $80 at the asshole factory.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.260
Which is of course where you get new assholes.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.180
Fresh off the line.

48:54.900 --> 48:55.300
It's actually-

48:55.300 --> 48:59.780
Man, if you go to the asshole factory, you're just discounting all the mom and pop asshole stores.

48:59.780 --> 49:01.060
Like, asshole in the walls.

49:02.180 --> 49:07.540
But the asshole factory is really nice because you get to let the kids stuff themselves and

49:07.540 --> 49:11.060
they get to pick different accessories for them and they get to name the assholes.

49:11.060 --> 49:12.420
Build an asshole.

49:12.420 --> 49:14.500
Build an asshole at the asshole factory.

49:14.500 --> 49:17.380
That's a better approach.

49:18.820 --> 49:19.700
Do you want a Yahoo?

49:19.700 --> 49:20.340
Griff.

49:20.340 --> 49:21.540
Yeah, I do.

49:21.540 --> 49:23.860
This one was sent in by Sydney Pendle.

49:23.860 --> 49:24.580
Thank you, Sydney.

49:25.140 --> 49:29.060
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sleddog who asks,

49:29.060 --> 49:32.260
why won't my dad let me have any Steve Urkel objects?

49:34.820 --> 49:35.860
I like Steve Urkel.

49:36.420 --> 49:39.940
But my dad won't let me have a shirt, a doll, anything Steve Urkel.

49:39.940 --> 49:41.540
But I want Steve Urkel stuff.

49:41.540 --> 49:43.300
What can I do to get Steve Urkel stuff?

49:44.580 --> 49:47.460
Who the fuck calls him Steve Urkel?

49:48.260 --> 49:52.340
Like, if I knew where to get Steve Urkel stuff, you know what I would have more of?

49:53.380 --> 49:54.260
Steve Urkel stuff?

49:54.900 --> 49:56.500
Steve Urkel stuff, yeah.

49:56.500 --> 49:59.700
I would have it every day, people wouldn't know me as Justin McElroy,

49:59.700 --> 50:02.020
video game writer and media gadfly.

50:02.020 --> 50:04.900
They would know me as Justin McElroy,

50:04.900 --> 50:07.220
the guy who wears the shirt that says, did I do that?

50:07.780 --> 50:09.540
Got any cheese?

50:09.540 --> 50:12.180
Yeah, these are all great Steve Urkel jokes.

50:13.380 --> 50:19.620
I remember a kid in elementary school who 100% did have a fully rad t-shirt

50:19.620 --> 50:24.340
that had a picture of Steve Urkel and just that just said, did I do that?

50:24.340 --> 50:27.140
He was, of course, scooting his glasses up his nose.

50:27.140 --> 50:27.780
Yeah.

50:27.780 --> 50:30.660
Oh wait, I have an important question for this question asker,

50:31.460 --> 50:36.580
which is beside a Steve Urkel doll and a Steve Urkel shirt,

50:37.460 --> 50:39.540
what the fuck other Steve Urkel stuff is there?

50:39.540 --> 50:42.900
And by the way, I just love the nomenclature Steve Urkel objects.

50:43.620 --> 50:45.380
Where can I find a Steve Urkel totem?

50:46.100 --> 50:47.940
This belongs in a Steve Urkel museum.

50:47.940 --> 50:56.900
I actually, in elementary school, I had a t-shirt with Cody from Step by Step on it.

50:56.900 --> 50:58.020
Didn't catch on so much.

50:58.580 --> 51:01.780
Didn't get me as much critical acclaim as this Steve Urkel shirt might have.

51:02.820 --> 51:05.620
It had Cody's hit catchphrase on it.

51:05.620 --> 51:06.260
Which was?

51:07.300 --> 51:09.540
Which was, yeah, right.

51:10.580 --> 51:12.340
He said that all the time on Step by Step.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.020
I did not.

51:14.020 --> 51:14.980
I don't remember that.

51:14.980 --> 51:16.820
I remember the episode that Steve Urkel was on.

51:16.820 --> 51:17.700
Mm-hmm.

51:17.700 --> 51:20.260
I'm gonna give you guys, let's say that this,

51:20.260 --> 51:22.660
okay, so apparently this person's never heard of eBay.

51:22.660 --> 51:26.500
I'm gonna help them out and say like, here's where you can get your Steve Urkel stuff.

51:28.260 --> 51:31.540
So here are some of the items that you can no bullshit get right now.

51:32.180 --> 51:36.900
You can get a 1991 Hasbro Steve Urkel 17 inch doll that talks.

51:36.900 --> 51:39.700
And it does say here returns not accepted.

51:41.060 --> 51:44.020
I don't want this shit back in my house ever again.

51:44.020 --> 51:46.820
I'm tired of this doll trying to kill me at night.

51:46.820 --> 51:49.940
This is the person who thought the Steve Urkel movement would be bigger.

51:49.940 --> 51:57.220
And they just ordered like a wholesale on mass boxes and boxes of Steve Urkel dolls.

51:57.220 --> 51:58.260
Must move.

51:58.260 --> 51:58.740
Oh my God.

51:59.380 --> 52:07.060
You can get right now a box of an unopened box of Urkel-O's the fruit,

52:07.060 --> 52:11.380
the fun fruit cereal that does not contain any cheese,

52:11.380 --> 52:14.340
but does contain essential vitamins and minerals.

52:14.340 --> 52:17.780
And it is flavored like strawberry and banana from the fine people of Ralston.

52:17.780 --> 52:21.460
You can get that for a starting bid of 74.95.

52:21.460 --> 52:23.300
No takers at the moment.

52:23.300 --> 52:25.940
Wait, just to clarify, did you say opened or unopened?

52:27.940 --> 52:29.140
It doesn't matter, Travis.

52:29.140 --> 52:29.700
Okay.

52:29.700 --> 52:35.540
As porous as that cardboard is, you are paying $75 to get diarrhea forever.

52:35.540 --> 52:41.700
There is a shirt that has a picture of Steve Urkel with like that cool sort of neon scribbling

52:41.700 --> 52:45.540
that was so big in that time period that says, no sweat, my pet.

52:45.540 --> 52:46.580
Oh, Jesus.

52:46.580 --> 52:52.500
You can pick that up and you can also get a WWD shirt that says, what would Urkel do on it?

52:52.500 --> 52:55.220
Or, okay, this is the last one, I promise.

52:55.220 --> 53:02.820
You can get the Urkel board game called, Do the Urkel.

53:02.820 --> 53:06.900
Board game called Do the Urkel dance.

53:07.780 --> 53:09.460
It's just called Do the Urkel.

53:09.460 --> 53:10.900
It's a risk and roll game.

53:12.020 --> 53:14.660
Okay, this is actually the tagline.

53:14.660 --> 53:17.140
The risk and roll game that lets you be Urkel.

53:18.900 --> 53:19.700
Finally.

53:19.700 --> 53:20.500
Thank God.

53:20.500 --> 53:21.060
Finally.

53:21.860 --> 53:23.860
God, we were into that, huh?

53:23.860 --> 53:24.340
Yeah.

53:24.340 --> 53:26.180
We were deep in.

53:26.740 --> 53:31.140
Can you real quick just eBay search Cody from step by step?

53:31.140 --> 53:32.740
I will.

53:32.740 --> 53:34.340
I bet you can actually buy the man.

53:34.340 --> 53:36.580
Let me see what I get with no returns.

53:36.580 --> 53:37.060
No returns.

53:37.060 --> 53:38.980
No, no items.

53:38.980 --> 53:40.100
I'm so sorry.

53:40.100 --> 53:43.300
I mean, where do you think step by step went wrong?

53:43.300 --> 53:46.820
Do you think the problem is that it was Family Matters?

53:46.820 --> 53:48.500
Yes, I think-

53:48.500 --> 53:53.140
That was their first slip up is that America's heart, there's a family size hole in America's

53:53.140 --> 53:56.980
heart, which was profoundly filled by Family Matters.

53:56.980 --> 53:58.180
And then step by step came in.

53:58.180 --> 53:59.540
It's like, hey, can we just scooch?

53:59.540 --> 54:00.980
Can we, oh, nope.

54:00.980 --> 54:05.380
Oh, and then to be fair, Cody did leave about two or three seasons in and was replaced by

54:05.380 --> 54:08.260
Flash, who was on just massive amounts of speed.

54:08.820 --> 54:12.500
I think the problem was it was like the Brady Bunch, except where you wanted to have sex

54:12.500 --> 54:13.860
with too many of the girls.

54:13.860 --> 54:14.980
And it got pretty emotional.

54:14.980 --> 54:16.340
Unlike the Brady Bunch?

54:16.340 --> 54:17.140
I don't understand.

54:17.140 --> 54:19.700
Unlike the, yeah, sorry.

54:19.700 --> 54:21.220
Plus, you know what the other problem was?

54:21.220 --> 54:24.580
It was confusing to try to remember-

54:24.580 --> 54:25.780
Who was with which one?

54:25.780 --> 54:26.260
Yeah.

54:26.260 --> 54:27.540
Who was with which family?

54:27.540 --> 54:28.500
It wasn't that clear.

54:28.500 --> 54:29.460
Brady Bunch had it, right?

54:29.460 --> 54:35.700
After a while, they started, I guess, morph into one solid family unit, and I hated it.

54:35.700 --> 54:39.860
I wanted them to stay on separate sides and continue to dislike each other forever and

54:39.860 --> 54:39.940
ever.

54:39.940 --> 54:43.700
You were looking for a Game of Thrones-style family battle.

54:46.660 --> 54:53.540
Do you think that there's a separate side series to the Brady Bunch that features the

54:53.540 --> 54:58.900
two parents that they divorce just living cold, lonely lives where they never see their

54:58.900 --> 54:59.860
children ever?

54:59.860 --> 55:05.860
Here's a story about a guy named Jeff and a lady named Mary.

55:05.860 --> 55:08.420
They never mate, and then they died.

55:09.300 --> 55:14.900
So alone, they never heard from their kids again because their kids have new brothers

55:14.900 --> 55:15.460
and sisters.

55:16.660 --> 55:18.260
Their kids never mentioned them.

55:18.260 --> 55:22.660
They seem to have forgotten them or that they ever even existed at all.

55:22.660 --> 55:29.860
So Jeff and Mary live lives of desperation, renting movies at the red box, and that's

55:29.860 --> 55:37.060
the way they became depressed and forgotten, dead and forgotten.

55:37.860 --> 55:43.460
They are dust now, and their memories evaporated.

55:44.260 --> 55:45.860
It's like they never were born.

55:48.660 --> 55:49.860
That was dumb.

55:49.860 --> 55:51.220
That was dumb.

55:53.780 --> 55:56.020
Oh man, that's a tough life they led.

55:56.020 --> 55:58.900
We sure do have a good time here, my brother, my brother, and me.

55:59.620 --> 56:00.660
Well, let's get serious.

56:00.660 --> 56:02.740
Let's get serious.

56:02.740 --> 56:03.220
Every year-

56:03.220 --> 56:05.700
Hey guys, we've had a lot of laughs today.

56:05.700 --> 56:08.900
Every year, Jaleel White dies a little bit more.

56:10.900 --> 56:12.580
Just trying to get that comeback.

56:12.580 --> 56:16.900
We really need your money so that we can go on eBay and buy some more Stivercal stuff.

56:16.900 --> 56:20.900
Will, other than Dancing with the Stars, which is where he is right now, right this second,

56:20.900 --> 56:25.060
will Jaleel White ever be on another hit television program?

56:25.780 --> 56:26.340
The Bachelor.

56:26.340 --> 56:30.420
Do you know the madness that would ensue if he were to roll up on-

56:31.220 --> 56:31.620
I don't-

56:32.340 --> 56:33.380
Literally anything?

56:34.180 --> 56:35.380
Like what would be the show?

56:35.380 --> 56:36.580
Where would he have to-

56:36.580 --> 56:38.500
It would have to be Big Bang Theory, right?

56:38.500 --> 56:38.740
No.

56:38.740 --> 56:41.220
Like he would have to roll up on Big Bang Theory as-

56:41.220 --> 56:42.260
As Stivercal.

56:42.260 --> 56:42.580
No, I don't want-

56:42.580 --> 56:44.580
As a professor at the-

56:44.580 --> 56:47.220
Oh my God, I would lose my mind.

56:47.860 --> 56:51.700
Not that I would see it, but I would presumably see it later on YouTube or something.

56:52.660 --> 56:54.820
I will also accept a community guest spot.

56:55.540 --> 56:56.340
I'm saying-

56:56.340 --> 57:03.460
I want him to explore his dramatic roots, and I want him to maybe hop on Southland as like,

57:03.460 --> 57:04.660
I'm Detective Humphries.

57:05.220 --> 57:08.740
And everybody else is like, no, you're definitely not.

57:08.740 --> 57:09.780
Guys, we've had a lot of fun.

57:11.380 --> 57:13.220
We're about to wrap up the show, but just real quick.

57:13.220 --> 57:15.140
The last few gift levels.

57:15.140 --> 57:21.540
If you donate $50 a month to our Max Fund Drive to help support the show and keep us afloat and grow,

57:21.540 --> 57:25.700
and $50 a month, you are a member of the Thorn Family Blondie Brigade.

57:25.700 --> 57:29.940
You will get all this stuff, the John Hodgson Friendship Emergency Kit, the water bottle,

57:29.940 --> 57:32.340
the friendship bracelet, all the Donors Only episodes.

57:32.340 --> 57:40.500
You will also get a batch, a homemade batch, I should say, of Jesse and Teresa Thorn's signature

57:40.500 --> 57:44.660
blondies. They will FedEx these blondies to your door.

57:44.660 --> 57:48.820
I hear they use special preservative chemicals in it to make sure the blondies don't get riddled

57:48.820 --> 57:49.780
with male worms.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.700
You are going to love eating these with your mouth.

57:53.700 --> 57:56.740
So sweet, so savory, from famous people.

57:56.740 --> 57:58.660
You are going to love them, I guarantee it.

57:58.660 --> 57:59.860
That's the $50 a month.

57:59.860 --> 58:02.260
$100 a month, you're a member of Jesse's Golden Eagles.

58:02.260 --> 58:05.940
You get an invitation to the Max Fun Dinner, which is a thing we do every June before

58:05.940 --> 58:14.660
Max Fun Con starts, where you get to just eat dinner with us and with John Hodgman and Jesse

58:14.660 --> 58:15.300
and Jordan.

58:15.300 --> 58:16.420
Well, we don't know who will be.

58:16.420 --> 58:16.820
We don't know.

58:16.820 --> 58:17.380
We can't promise.

58:17.380 --> 58:18.820
We can't promise who will be there, but...

58:18.820 --> 58:25.620
Last time, me and Griffin had dinner with John Hodgman and Chuck Bryant from Stuff You

58:25.620 --> 58:27.380
Should Know, and it was great.

58:27.380 --> 58:28.260
It was totally rad.

58:28.820 --> 58:29.860
Neil Pollock was there.

58:29.860 --> 58:31.300
It was bananas, actually.

58:32.020 --> 58:34.900
So you get that, you get the blondies, you get the friendship kit, the water bottle,

58:34.900 --> 58:36.580
the friendship bracelet, and the episodes.

58:36.580 --> 58:44.660
And if you really want to keep us lined with piles of sweet cocoa, you can donate $200

58:44.660 --> 58:47.060
a month and join Jordan's Platinum Angels.

58:47.060 --> 58:51.540
You get all this stuff, the invitation to the dinner, all that stuff, and free registration

58:51.540 --> 58:57.620
to next year's Max Fun Con, which is Maximum Fun's annual convention that we are going

58:57.620 --> 59:00.500
to be at this year in June.

59:00.500 --> 59:06.260
So just go to MaximumFun.org forward slash donate and just look over the levels, reach

59:06.260 --> 59:12.340
into your heart, grab the love that you have for us that's in there, and then pull it out

59:12.340 --> 59:14.820
and then put it on your computer screen, smear it on it.

59:14.820 --> 59:16.100
And guys, do us a favor.

59:17.540 --> 59:21.220
After you listen to this episode, go on Twitter and let us know when you donate, because we

59:21.220 --> 59:25.220
like to know that you're supporting us and make your friends feel guilty.

59:25.220 --> 59:27.940
And you can be superior over everyone else that has not donated.

59:27.940 --> 59:28.900
That's the big thing.

59:28.900 --> 59:32.500
Like, just use that Max Fun Drive hashtag and just be like, hey, listen, fools.

59:33.140 --> 59:33.780
I donate it.

59:33.780 --> 59:38.580
And then start bullying other people into it, because that's the whole point of feeling

59:38.580 --> 59:39.460
superior, I thought.

59:40.820 --> 59:45.220
Don't get on Twitter, though, and use that hashtag and talk about how we're big Corpo

59:45.220 --> 59:48.820
sellouts, because we really only do this once a year.

59:48.820 --> 59:53.620
And the return really is overwhelming.

59:53.620 --> 59:56.500
And we just we love you guys so much.

59:56.500 --> 59:57.700
Thank you, John Roger, for the long one.

59:57.700 --> 59:58.740
Let's use their song.

59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.740
It's Departure off the output of Dayspend.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.540
You can go grab that.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.660
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show and sending us questions and everything.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.940
We we love you very much.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:06.900
We appreciate all that.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:12.900
And if you want to send us a question, it's NBNBAM at maximumfund.org.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.340
And we will try to answer it or you can send it to Yahoo there or what have you.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:16.740
Griffin.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.620
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Mark Toretsky.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.420
Thanks, Mark.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.100
It's by Yahoo Answers user Corrin Piper Chifinch.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:29.620
Who asks, is it normal for a woman to arrive on a date dressed as a clown?

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:29.620
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:29.620
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:29.620
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:29.620
This is my brother.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:29.620
My brother may kiss your dad.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:59.380
You wear it on the lips.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.860
I listen to actually every show on Max Fund.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.180
You could say relentless positivity.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.780
That's probably a good way of putting it.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:10.180
They're always looking at things in the way I'd like the world to be looked at.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.140
Hi, I'm Davin.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.100
And I'm Lindsay.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.340
And we donate to maximumfund.org.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.060
Probably my brother.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:18.660
My brother and me was the first full episode I listened to.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:23.060
Yeah, NBNBAM was a pretty great way to start her off because those McElroys are charming.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.260
Listen to people be friends.

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:25.700
Best thing.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.700
I'm super excited about throwing shade and it's so funny and it's so charming.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.380
Yeah, honestly, I feel like every year Max Fund adds new shows.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.460
And every year I step up my donation to make sure that more shows can join.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:42.740
Yeah, I think it's really easy to support people who make fantastic things.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:49.140
I get a ridiculous amount of entertainment from Max Fund every month and it doesn't cost me a lot.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.700
Support Maximum Fund today.

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:55.700
Just visit maximumfund.org slash donate.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:25.460
Thank you.
