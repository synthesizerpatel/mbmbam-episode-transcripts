00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.600
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a very special,

00:47.600 --> 00:54.240
very personal episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me. We have an announcement to make

00:54.240 --> 01:04.880
uh to begin this uh episode and um gosh guys I don't really know how to well I mean we we've

01:04.880 --> 01:08.960
consulted a lot of our family and friends and a lot of people we really respect and

01:10.160 --> 01:14.560
I think it's time that we just you know it's 20 dirt it's time we come clean it's 20 that's so

01:14.560 --> 01:26.160
true Travis it's 20 dirt it's time to dig it up come clean we have been doping there it is beginning

01:26.960 --> 01:37.040
in June of 1998 basically over a decade before we would begin the show in preparation

01:37.040 --> 01:47.680
to record this program we have been injecting bull semen into our buttocks nature's funniest animal

01:49.360 --> 02:00.400
nature's funniest liquid uh directly into us um every day every hour for the past 15 years I am

02:00.400 --> 02:09.600
I am fucking chock full of bull semen and like it it's I sweat the stuff and it's

02:09.600 --> 02:16.240
right do you know how the human body is like 75% water at this point Griffin is like 72% bull

02:16.240 --> 02:25.440
semen right um it's why I can't really run I ambulate slowly but it's because I'm very viscous

02:25.440 --> 02:34.320
inside um and he he basically can't go to a dairy farm they will go hide he basically if he walks

02:34.320 --> 02:39.680
runs through with hands outstretched he can impregnate 10 to 15 cows a second yeah they get

02:39.680 --> 02:49.680
it's amazing they they will try to get on top of this and now I'm flattered now a lot of people ask

02:49.680 --> 02:56.160
how you get into this sort of there is a an underworld I guess and I'm I'm I'm worried about

02:56.160 --> 03:02.960
outing people but I guess well let's use let's use code names then we'll say schmorton schmorris

03:02.960 --> 03:09.680
okay schmorton schmorris got us into it and uh he was one of the first that really turned us

03:09.680 --> 03:20.320
onto it and dan kennison basically sam kennison but he's dead so like yeah yeah and uh what's

03:20.320 --> 03:26.080
that other angry guy shouty kind of shouty fucking everybody likes him because he said a bunch of

03:26.080 --> 03:35.920
raymond things on him bill you know comedy bill bill cosby yeah that's it so bill cosby

03:35.920 --> 03:46.800
i'm so full of the pussy but that's how we started we didn't we couldn't take the injections

03:46.800 --> 03:55.200
phil william cosby was my comedy coach in high school sure and we were trying to make state for

03:56.560 --> 04:02.880
comedy comedy stay and he says uh you know that show the state that's what that's what it's about

04:02.880 --> 04:08.080
he says you look he did it but in a bill cosby voice how would that sound

04:08.960 --> 04:21.120
um you gotta get a leg up on the competition and so that's melting at the end of it that's when i

04:21.120 --> 04:30.480
started well he was so so just jam ram jammed with cum and like um so like that's how i got

04:30.480 --> 04:38.480
started was pressure from from coach cosby yeah uh listen guys let's put this note we will continue

04:38.480 --> 04:43.760
to inject ourselves with bull can you guys believe that they didn't induct anybody to the comedy hall

04:43.760 --> 04:50.320
of fame this year yeah yeah just because of all the jizzing we've been you got to retire from

04:50.320 --> 04:55.920
comedy for five years and i can't think of anybody well and the problem is is like even after that

04:55.920 --> 05:00.000
when you break comedy records they're still going to put an asterisk next your name right but not

05:00.000 --> 05:06.800
only that but there are so many great comedy champs out there that don't jizz like bobcat goldthwait

05:07.520 --> 05:12.800
he's oh yeah he was a staunch anti-jizzer right you could make the argument that that jerry

05:12.800 --> 05:19.600
seinfeld retired from comedy decades ago right and uh and he's still out there never jizzed you

05:19.600 --> 05:25.280
can't no way has he never jizzed julia louise drivers was telling me that she tried to get him

05:25.280 --> 05:30.000
to yeah and he just shut her down and then canceled the show he was like i'm sick of the

05:30.000 --> 05:34.240
pressure and he canceled it but we're not canceling this show we're gonna move right on

05:34.800 --> 05:40.160
let's uh let's get our first question up in the mix this one comes to us from uh uh i would i

05:40.160 --> 05:44.160
would also point out we never actually introduced ourselves but i mean at this point people come on

05:44.160 --> 05:50.960
i'm justin i'm i'm i'm travis i'm gonna say griffin you wanna switch i've been fucked up

05:50.960 --> 05:57.600
you wanna switch for the show good up yeah i'm griffin okay fuck it i'm travis somebody hand me

05:57.600 --> 06:05.760
an everything bagel with a ham with a ham hock on it i'm greg okay the footballer the football

06:05.760 --> 06:14.960
loves touchdown yeah i love tds guys i feel like shit what's wrong i drank too much alcohol what

06:14.960 --> 06:21.520
happened i did uh we did did these shots that i learned from epic meal time called the gordon

06:21.520 --> 06:27.120
bombay where you take a shot of bombay gin and then have everyone call you gordon for the rest

06:27.120 --> 06:34.320
of the night fuck those guys are funny they are jizzing they are jizzing to the fucking max and

06:34.320 --> 06:40.560
like i am worried about where like their health is i hope that they come maybe they'll come to max

06:40.560 --> 06:45.120
funcon someday and just like eat but that would be bad because it's in an isolated environment

06:46.240 --> 06:50.480
it'll become like a like a doner party kind of thing yeah right they'll eat all the food and

06:50.480 --> 06:58.000
then they're just like a meal time cannibalism yeah turn into hunger games um uh i left my

06:58.000 --> 07:03.120
college town a couple years ago the old gang is slowly starting to break up one member of the

07:03.120 --> 07:09.280
gang is the one who got away and i never confessed the fact that i've been crazy for him since we

07:09.280 --> 07:14.240
met several years ago i've already moved away from our college town and only go back to visit

07:14.240 --> 07:18.880
he'll be moving away within the year should i risk our remaining long distance friendship to

07:18.880 --> 07:24.400
get it off my chest i know 20 does was the year getting it but i'm not sure what to do in 20

07:24.400 --> 07:30.800
bakers does um how could we be from gmail any fucking clearer about what you're supposed to do

07:30.800 --> 07:39.200
do in 20 dirt 20 dirt dig it up dig this shit up this is dirt this is dirty this is dirty dirt

07:39.200 --> 07:46.720
get out the shovel scoop it and poop it get it out there you you this relationship

07:46.720 --> 07:51.120
is a long distance relationship which is to say it's not one right yeah you might as well like

07:51.120 --> 07:56.080
the first uh three quarters of of that question was just like it's dissolving it's dissolving

07:56.080 --> 08:02.160
it's dissolving it's dissolving what do i do fuck it fuck it check take a shot maybe he

08:02.160 --> 08:08.960
feels the same way is it too late to change the name of the year to 20 fuck yeah it is it really

08:08.960 --> 08:19.120
rick really really is ricky is it ricky is the year of dj can i learn dj with my mouth i i say

08:19.120 --> 08:25.760
i say just do it now there are two different ways to do it option a is you know the the

08:25.760 --> 08:32.080
confessing of your love and say hey i've always option b is to say hey confetti

08:33.680 --> 08:36.240
option a confetti i always loved you

08:38.400 --> 08:42.480
just rip taylor him right let's have rip taylor go do some toupee humor

08:43.760 --> 08:48.880
then option he'll get it he'll get it he'll know what's up and then option b is to say

08:48.880 --> 08:54.080
i just matter of fact like hey devon by the way i've always dug you all right see you later side

08:54.080 --> 08:59.920
note sorry quick addendum editors editor's note asterisk nobody's ever loved anyone named devon

09:02.240 --> 09:05.920
man anytime we goof on a day there's always one guy is like

09:06.960 --> 09:11.120
ah that's me i i'm really worried that there's a devon out there is like you got me

09:12.880 --> 09:19.760
i am alone that one is good i am alone that is a good one you guys got me um

09:19.760 --> 09:27.280
um yeah i mean you know it's it's long this this i know this feeling i know this feeling

09:27.280 --> 09:32.880
of like everyone's starting to move away in a friend group starting to to bifurcate and perhaps

09:32.880 --> 09:40.400
even trifurcate uh but but that's a great time to shore up some of the ones that matter to you the

09:40.400 --> 09:50.800
most and if this is uh a guy that you care about then i mean why not i'm always gonna we're always

09:50.800 --> 09:56.320
gonna tell you to to to go for it and stuff like this i mean friendships are nice but especially

09:56.320 --> 10:00.320
long distance friendships it's a perfect situation you never have to see the guy right if it doesn't

10:00.320 --> 10:05.520
work out you're never gonna see this fucko he's gone i mean honestly the worst the worst that

10:05.520 --> 10:09.760
is probably no the worst that could happen is like an asteroid falls from the sky but like

10:09.760 --> 10:14.160
the worst that's probably going to happen is if he doesn't reciprocate the feelings

10:14.160 --> 10:19.040
it may be awkward for like a month or two but i mean you guys have known each other for a while

10:19.040 --> 10:23.040
now and it's long distance so it's not like you have to awkwardly see each other that is that is

10:23.040 --> 10:28.160
not it'll be fine again that is not how that's gonna go down it's he's not gonna say no he's

10:28.160 --> 10:34.400
gonna also see the plate tectonics shifting the two of you away from each other this is

10:34.400 --> 10:39.520
at any given point in your life there are like 10 people who this is your last chance to fuck them

10:40.240 --> 10:46.560
oh you're painting a can't hardly wait situation i don't know what the fuck you're talking about

10:46.560 --> 10:56.160
okay i'm saying that it look around look around you really look around you this only works if

10:56.160 --> 11:01.440
you're like outside but look around you because the only thing in this room is uh my cat and my

11:01.440 --> 11:08.080
sensi okay i might pretend that this is out of 30 rock okay have you hugged your mug today okay

11:08.080 --> 11:13.120
well you guys can make pretend to do this with these things but i'm saying like you're on a bus

11:13.120 --> 11:19.360
and you just got to the diversity stop and there goes six people just got off the bus you are never

11:19.360 --> 11:24.560
going to have another chance to fuck those six people again or that sensi candle or that have

11:24.560 --> 11:28.720
you hugged a mug today mug so they're like the six feet maybe there'll be the six people you

11:28.720 --> 11:33.760
fucking heaven that's possible it's hard to say but i'm assuming you ride the bus a lot and

11:33.760 --> 11:38.560
therefore come in contact with this situation thousands of times in your lifetime so it's more

11:38.560 --> 11:49.840
like like the 650 000 people that you i actually have a i not a joke uh i i actually do think this

11:49.840 --> 11:56.000
way on occasion not about sex though but about uh like if i'm in a in a place i've never been

11:56.000 --> 12:01.360
in a place i've never been before and i'm moving through it you know like say an airport or

12:01.360 --> 12:08.560
something like that as i'm passing those those people it is almost certainly the only time i'm

12:08.560 --> 12:13.840
ever gonna see them it is intoxicating right basically well no what because the way i think

12:13.840 --> 12:19.040
about it is that basically as soon as i avert my eyes from those people they're dead basically

12:19.040 --> 12:23.440
like they're dead that's actually how i operate in just everyday life just when i don't see my

12:23.440 --> 12:28.960
friends they're dead whenever i'm not talking to you guys you're dead so it's my world that

12:28.960 --> 12:33.680
only exists within a six-foot circle around so like when babies start to figure out like

12:33.680 --> 12:39.120
spatial understanding uh-huh that's just like no object permanent you just skip that one we

12:39.120 --> 12:44.480
tried to play peekaboo with travis it just screams it just screams wildly where are you

12:44.480 --> 12:51.440
what the fuck just there was a man there was a man named clint this sounds like a pretty good

12:51.440 --> 12:57.920

annoying because like this is a this is a woman on the go you know i feel like the whole present

17:37.360 --> 17:42.400
is fucking annoying i mean it's thoughtful if the if the woman doesn't have gps and she gets lost

17:42.400 --> 17:47.840
you know but what's less thoughtful is if you get it for for that purpose but then you instead of

17:47.840 --> 17:53.280
saying you just take out the word turn right and you replace it with i love you susan will you be

17:53.280 --> 18:00.240

every todd has to be a like some sort of sportsman let's go with gilbert oh that's much much much

18:08.000 --> 18:15.200
better gill oh sorry gilbert sorry the sorry the gilbert that listens to this show we sincerely

18:15.200 --> 18:20.560
apologize listen is it appropriate to chime in when someone's getting heavy praise for something

18:20.560 --> 18:25.680
you did most of the work on or are you supposed to catch the praise giver in private and then let

18:25.680 --> 18:32.400
them know the real deal or are you supposed to just let it go that's from feeling gypped in japan

18:32.400 --> 18:37.120
that's okay i don't know why we got a good question that's offensive that's an offensive

18:37.120 --> 18:43.760
name but anyway feeling traveler in japan i think they prefer travelers feeling romanied

18:43.760 --> 18:50.080
feeling romanied nomadic fortune tellers okay that might be that might be racist hold on i think we

18:50.080 --> 18:59.120
crossed backwards secret werewolf curse lingered here's the problem is it's it's like a lose lose

18:59.120 --> 19:06.000
lose situation it really really wicked is that's why the dude is supposed to say like hey i that

19:06.000 --> 19:11.200
it wasn't just me this is a this is not a one-man team yeah i think that's i think that's fourth

19:11.200 --> 19:19.040
option is you confront the the praise given later and be like hey uh what the fuck um all you did

19:19.040 --> 19:26.080
was get the coffee and i did 16 hours of work you got you got a logic trap this guy like while

19:26.080 --> 19:32.080
everyone's praising and be like oh great do it again right now in front of all of us let's see it

19:32.080 --> 19:39.680
here are the twigs do it what what possible thing could someone be praised for with twigs

19:39.680 --> 19:49.360
shitty birdhouse okay that's called a nest you dumb ass build a nest again bird i did that that

19:49.360 --> 19:56.480
bird didn't build that nest i did check the nest that's my saliva holding those twigs twigs when i

19:56.480 --> 20:03.120
am a dad the one i will tell my children everything the truth about everything but the one thing i

20:03.120 --> 20:08.640
will tell them that is not true is that i made every nest so they see a nest of the tree i made

20:08.640 --> 20:13.600
it their dear old dad was the guy when they asked what you do for a living like well every day i

20:13.600 --> 20:19.040
take my briefcase full of twigs and i go out for eight hours a day and make nests the city pays me

20:19.040 --> 20:26.320
to do it those uh those grackles really do look comfortable you're right daddy did that daddy did

20:26.320 --> 20:32.400
that for those grackles you could call people who own birdhouses slumlords my dad's building

20:32.400 --> 20:40.640
organic housing so here's the issue with this option one you interrupt and say um excuse me uh

20:40.640 --> 20:45.920
boss man i did all the work that's the worst you look shitty that's the worst one don't do that

20:45.920 --> 20:52.240
unless no way benefits unless unless you do it in a fun way like when he's like i put this

20:52.240 --> 20:58.320
presentation together and everyone's clapping and you go and i helped like like the shake and bake

20:58.320 --> 21:04.480
ads like the old shake and bake advertisements and people will get a real kick out of it and then

21:04.480 --> 21:10.320
the boss will turn to to michael's and be like michael's is this true and he'll be like oh yeah

21:10.320 --> 21:18.880
yeah johnson's johnson's definitely helped your last name is johnson your last name is plural

21:20.080 --> 21:22.960
my father founded the big johnson's t-shirt company

21:22.960 --> 21:30.160
i'll be damned if i let it sit and follow the likes of you uh listen uh the the these are all

21:30.160 --> 21:36.400
bad yeah i think the only one don't talk to the person in private because then like that looks

21:36.400 --> 21:42.720
really really bad because it looks so shady and like underhanded but like hey um i didn't want

21:42.720 --> 21:49.520
to say anything earlier right oh but he didn't do all the work i did the i i mean i don't think

21:49.520 --> 21:56.640
it's a terrible idea to go to the to the person and say like listen we've both worked on this it

21:56.640 --> 22:03.440
would mean a lot to me if you but then he'd be like oh oh oh what about this you go to him and

22:03.440 --> 22:08.080
say hey i really appreciated all the things and the nice things you said about the project we

22:08.080 --> 22:12.320
work really hard on it i didn't get a chance to earlier but i just wanted to say thank you i

22:12.320 --> 22:19.200
really appreciated the acknowledgement oh no that's like a crazy thing but i kind of that's

22:19.200 --> 22:26.320
really manipulative yeah you act as though dude also called you out and then he's like uh could

22:26.320 --> 22:31.520
i yeah congratulations that's a pr i like that travis i'm actually into that could i do that for

22:31.520 --> 22:38.640
anything though sorry like if i go to like a live theater show and like everybody's clapping and be

22:38.640 --> 22:45.200
like guys thank thank you guys thank you so much for just acknowledging all of our hard work up

22:45.200 --> 22:48.880
there we get up there every day just trying to make you laugh trying to make you cry trying to

22:48.880 --> 22:54.400
make you clap you can always pretend to be the director no one knows no we're the writer who

22:54.400 --> 23:00.000
knows who wrote a play really well unless you're unless it's like a shakespeare show which went

23:00.000 --> 23:06.240
good luck that was me every time i see shakespeare when everybody's clapping i i like they shout

23:06.240 --> 23:13.040
and i shout like they shout like bravo i'm i'm shouting like author author because i hope one

23:13.040 --> 23:21.520
time he's like what shakespeare you're saying yeah you hope one time that one out of out of

23:21.520 --> 23:27.840
let's say the 30 times you've seen a shakespeare show he arrives he arrives just in time he he

23:27.840 --> 23:34.800
splits up through the floorboards very spooky goes to shakespeare and he's like you did a good

23:34.800 --> 23:40.560
job with my play okay and and the reason he comes is because you just imagine i have shakily

23:40.560 --> 23:47.200
supported his art form maybe 20 or 30 times i'm so glad i was able to reach one special boy in this

23:47.200 --> 23:53.360
room only one person appreciated my play and then what if later that night you're watching

23:53.360 --> 23:58.880
along came polly on dvd at home and he pops out of the tv like i did this one too like i don't

23:58.880 --> 24:05.840
think you did really this one's based on othello is it is it really you know if you hung out with

24:05.840 --> 24:11.120
shakespeare's ghost he would try to claim everything is some permutation oh yes the

24:11.120 --> 24:18.640
incredible mr limpin it's very much like hamlet think about it really shakespeare it kind of

24:19.280 --> 24:25.920
seems you know what is like mine is oedipus rex i'll hold on there because you that one is definitely

24:25.920 --> 24:29.280
not you but wouldn't it be great to be hanging out with him in like 10 things i hate about you

24:29.280 --> 24:35.200
come on and he's like this was come on they got it they improved it they nailed it i thought

24:37.280 --> 24:41.760
i was gonna make a joke about i always get confused if that woman's name is elisa

24:41.760 --> 24:48.800
olenik or larissa olenik can anyone come it's larissa the one thing i know is that the secret

24:48.800 --> 24:54.000
world of alex mack was based on two gentlemen of verona think about it because the one gentleman

24:54.000 --> 25:03.120
can dissolve into a pool of water it's not water griffin sorry it's it's ectoplasm she's a ghost

25:03.120 --> 25:07.760
how about a yahoo can i keep talking about shakespeare's ghost i'm really into it do you

25:07.760 --> 25:12.640
think he asked everyone if they have boz lerman's number so you can call him and tell him he's a

25:12.640 --> 25:22.000
dick i did i did like leonardo de caprio but everything else was just leo leo was great and

25:22.000 --> 25:30.720
that john leguizamo don't get me started what a delightful hispanic hold on hold on shakespeare

25:32.160 --> 25:36.080
i like the movie about the more who teaches keanu how to fight

25:37.600 --> 25:44.880
do you mean the matrix and did you just say the more could you not it's laurence fishburne

25:44.880 --> 25:52.480
shakespeare you know he would claim to make up most words too anytime you used an impressive word

25:52.480 --> 26:00.800
he would have to slip in there you know i i coined that in hamlet eight hamlet eight hamlet the eight

26:01.680 --> 26:07.040
hamlet eight that was it was never produced i just finished the manuscript when i died i can

26:07.040 --> 26:12.240
show you where i hid it if you want oh no okay it's just it's just an empty castle for two and

26:12.240 --> 26:19.760
a half hours and then somehow is a good day to hamlet i don't know i don't think it was a good

26:19.760 --> 26:27.120
name uh uh okay griffin now you can thank you i think i'm done talking about shakespeare's ghost

26:27.120 --> 26:35.840
cool i went to stratford upon avon uh for our honeymoon and uh i got a big kick out of when

26:35.840 --> 26:42.160
we got back pretending that there were more places named after shakespeare's plays in the uh in the

26:42.160 --> 26:48.880
restaurant areas than there were because there was really no i i wanted steakspeares there were no

26:48.880 --> 26:57.360
tie-ins what no tie-ins no tie-ins no no oh you know a subway would be great but they call it

26:57.360 --> 27:03.440
as you like it you can just get the sandwich however you want okay griffin now i'm really

27:03.440 --> 27:10.800
done i don't think i don't think i can trust you anymore i promise all right um this yahoo answer

27:10.800 --> 27:17.280
was sent in by ryan lowen thank you ryan it's by yahoo answers user friendly zombie who asks

27:19.600 --> 27:26.080
is it legal to smoke weed in space if an astronaut is out of any country would

27:26.080 --> 27:30.480
nasa have any legal recourse if you smoked a bowl in the space shuttle i think it's the

27:30.480 --> 27:38.240
kind of thing that they say not to do but everybody does it oh yeah i think the bigger problem is

27:38.880 --> 27:46.160
less the smoking than the fire i think that you do get into some issues i think they'd probably

27:46.160 --> 27:52.560
be okay with the weed if it wasn't for the you know open flame in a thing made of explosions

27:52.560 --> 27:58.320
i think is less than ideal that's actually what happened in apollo 13 dude sparked a bowl

27:58.320 --> 28:02.400
and they had a problem man that sounded so natural try this when you just said sparked a bowl

28:03.200 --> 28:10.320
i could tell you griffin i've been practicing you sounded like a real grade eight chief chiefer

28:12.080 --> 28:17.200
um you know you could just you can make this easier on yourself don't go to space to spark a

28:17.200 --> 28:27.440
bowl go go to the south pole no country oh that's true that's a fact you just go to the south pole

28:27.440 --> 28:34.400
and get like fucking lit just build a big like build the gazuntite institute down there at the

28:34.400 --> 28:39.520
south pole and everybody can just like get high and patch adams can can fix people up and there's

28:39.520 --> 28:45.360
no lawyers cops or toes because they all fell off your fucking foot because you're on the south

28:45.360 --> 28:51.680
goddamn pole what are you treated the gazuntite institute you know what a lot a lot of any

28:51.680 --> 28:58.160
anything related to freezing to death i have like probably the best at gangrene right now

28:58.160 --> 29:03.040
like if you get gangrene don't even trip because i i do have that under control i have a better

29:03.040 --> 29:11.280
place okay you're fucking attic or anywhere anywhere nobody's ever glow in the dark stars

29:11.280 --> 29:16.400
post them up on the ceiling you're in space all of a sudden you're in space you don't need to

29:16.400 --> 29:23.920
fucking nobody's ever gotten busted for doing weed fact fact because every time a cop catches

29:23.920 --> 29:32.640
someone kept doing weed they're like ah kids you do getting it you guys having fun being young

29:33.200 --> 29:38.560
enjoying it enjoying get out of here you're right get out of there enjoy that don't smoke it again

29:39.600 --> 29:45.520
but if you do it's fine we've had a lot of fun here today but i do think we need to clarify that

29:45.520 --> 29:51.040
i don't think this question asker was desperate to find a place he can smoke pot and space was his

29:51.040 --> 29:58.080
last refuge like there's there are many other steps i think to before you you you like resort

29:58.080 --> 30:05.440
to in a cave right you could always smoke in a cave underneath a camel why i mean why not it's

30:05.440 --> 30:09.840
easier to get to you than space it's just a place on the earth is what you're saying yeah i'm just

30:09.840 --> 30:13.760
i'm just thinking of places i could have said under a table but that's not as fun if the president

30:13.760 --> 30:20.480
united states of america sparked up a j uh-huh in the oval office you know he does why do i know

30:20.480 --> 30:25.520
he does what because he legalized it legalized it i don't he didn't though he's actually been

30:25.520 --> 30:30.400
cracking down he said he was gonna legalize it he put a big old check mark on that bill

30:30.400 --> 30:35.840
i yeah he was like approved approval what's the opposite of a veto is it an approval it's an

30:35.840 --> 30:41.520
approval but i think you may be um confusing legalized marijuana with unmanned drone strikes

30:41.520 --> 30:49.120
again i think you got it twisted maybe he gets high off unmanned drones oh that's the fucking

30:49.120 --> 30:57.440
stuff what was that a wedding awesome uh fuck shoot it into my veins and also into them all of

30:57.440 --> 31:12.640
them's shoot them's oh man getting political a little bit of fire edgy let's get paid

35:43.360 --> 35:50.320
a stream restraints.com extreme restraints.com is your number one source for things you can put in

35:50.320 --> 35:56.000
holes in your body if you want to put it in there don't waste time with a q-tip that's child's play

35:56.000 --> 36:01.120
why don't just skip right to a ribbed anal douche if you want something inside you but that's man's

36:01.120 --> 36:06.080
play that's man's play a ribbon illusion is great because it'll put something in you and take more

36:06.080 --> 36:10.160
out and it's also great because you can just say a bunch of syllables and it sounds like something

36:10.160 --> 36:17.040
like justin has been doing yeah right pleasurable uh anal douche it's designed out of latex and

36:17.040 --> 36:22.240
rubber first off make sure you get the pleasurable one if you get the uncomfortable sad one

36:22.240 --> 36:28.800
there's like that's extreme restraints.com there's probably a like a completely unpleasant ribbed

36:28.800 --> 36:32.880
anal douche uh but this one looks great looks like modern art you could put this on a shelf

36:32.880 --> 36:38.080
looks like modern family looks like the dyson back it's like that baby from modern family

36:38.080 --> 36:45.840
you know that fat 12 year old baby on modern family manny i love that show love that baby

36:47.120 --> 36:51.840

going to save you 20 percent on your purchases there and listen that's enough to go get yourself

36:59.360 --> 37:04.400
another anal douche because if you're anything like me your friends see the anal douche and you

37:04.400 --> 37:10.640
send them home with it you loan them you forget who you loan them to and uh and and you just end

37:10.640 --> 37:16.800
up needing more so go on and get a few a lot of people hear the word i feel like uh dane cook

37:16.800 --> 37:21.280
has taken the word douche and turned it into something oh i thought you're gonna say that

37:21.280 --> 37:26.000
people hear the phrase anal douche and they think of think of dane cook well i feel like i feel like

37:26.000 --> 37:34.640
people have take co-opted the word douche or anal douche although that's less popular um i'm turning

37:34.640 --> 37:39.360
into like a bad thing but i don't think that we should i don't think we should do that for a

37:39.360 --> 37:48.080
pleasurable and what if what if we rebrand and we go with douche hmm it sounds it sounds international

37:48.080 --> 37:53.680
which i do like i mean it probably is international in origin i i think that's probably there is

37:53.680 --> 37:59.200
probably some sort of european country that discovered that there is a lot of detritus

37:59.200 --> 38:03.920
up there yeah but since it's a tool for cleanliness we can assume it wasn't france

38:06.720 --> 38:08.080
jerry lewis

38:13.280 --> 38:18.720
christ yeah he's popular there he had a public did you guys know there's like a pub it was kind of a

38:18.720 --> 38:25.840
a public um it was a big deal that he got kicked out of the the whole jerry's kids mda

38:25.840 --> 38:32.240
thing it's like a it was like a a very public uh ousting of the jarrister so long story short

38:32.240 --> 38:40.240
visit extreme restraints.com and use the code and ponder ponder a man's life achievements

38:41.040 --> 38:47.760
squandered squandered reduced to ash only do charity if they're going to appreciate it

38:47.760 --> 38:52.640
that's all i'm saying i've been with my girlfriend for a little over two years and i want to ask her

38:52.640 --> 38:58.560
to marry me my only problem is that her sister five years older if that matters got engaged

38:58.560 --> 39:03.680
recently and her wedding will be this summer getting engaged was kind of a big deal for her

39:03.680 --> 39:07.680
and i'd feel a little guilty distracting from her wedding with excitement of another engagement

long as you're not hurting somebody so if you want to be an adult teen baby that's cool by me

43:37.840 --> 43:44.640

43:44.640 --> 43:50.480
trying to do right trying to do right by my baby mama okay that's a great plan dani ocean but how

43:50.480 --> 43:54.640

43:59.280 --> 44:03.280
supermarkets sleep they're trying to get the diapers into the cart right you get like one

44:03.280 --> 44:08.720
package at most the thing is you gotta put all of them on at once why do you have to do that

44:08.720 --> 44:14.480
that's the best way to sneak them into the house and then put your like big put your like a big

44:14.480 --> 44:22.000
dog sweatpants on your starter jacket and your starter jacket fluffy i don't think i oh you know

44:22.000 --> 44:29.120
you should do say your extreme couponing and that you got these you got you bought three you buy

44:29.120 --> 44:34.080
first of all once you pull this heist then you never have to do it again because you bring home

44:34.080 --> 44:40.720
360 different diapers now they are going to be they are going to be adult teen baby diapers so

44:40.720 --> 44:44.880

baby someday and then you got these diapers for like four dollars why don't you bring him horrified

44:49.360 --> 44:55.440
i have to ask this and i'm horrified to do so do they use the diapers of course they do why wouldn't

44:55.440 --> 44:59.840

45:04.560 --> 45:08.800

48:03.040 --> 48:08.400
realization that things were better when you were a kid people took care of you like yeah we all

48:08.400 --> 48:15.440
feel that way you're not weird you're just weak be stronger resistance impulses i have impulses

48:15.440 --> 48:20.400
every day to put on a diaper but let me tell you let me let me just give you this room i mean i'm

48:20.400 --> 48:24.560
strong let me give you this reminder adult teen baby because you don't remember this from when

48:24.560 --> 48:32.080
you were a baby but having your own poopy on your butt sucks that's so a trade-off with adulthood

48:32.080 --> 48:38.720
it's sort of like a benjamin button is that when you poopy in your diaper it's going to be on your

48:38.720 --> 48:43.280
butt you're going to hate it and let me also say this as a person a lot of my friends are having

48:43.280 --> 48:47.920
kids and i'm kind of surrounded by babies and kids now babies are awesome and people like to

48:47.920 --> 48:53.760
take care of them and and and baby them until they don't anymore until the kids start screaming

48:53.760 --> 48:58.640
until it becomes a thing it's not that awesome to be a baby hey listen i need some advice

48:58.640 --> 49:04.560
i work long hard days and when i get home i just need some time with myself i'm married and have

49:04.560 --> 49:10.480
one son as much as i absolutely love them i just need me some me time the only way i can get away

49:10.480 --> 49:16.640
is in the shower here's my question how can i spice up shower time once in a while i have a

49:16.640 --> 49:21.760
shower beer oh no are there other ways to treat myself that shower guy from the southern gulf

49:21.760 --> 49:27.520
islands and he sounds awesome he sounds like what about a full-on shower wet bar i don't know

49:27.520 --> 49:32.720
shower wet bar i feel like i should be asking him for advice yeah why stop at a shower beer

49:33.520 --> 49:38.000
have yourself a shower manhattan okay that's nice that's good because the actual recipe

49:38.560 --> 49:46.080
for the manhattan is i believe uh a tablespoon of bitters and then uh sweet vermouth and then

49:46.080 --> 49:52.160
two and a half cups of lukewarm shower water delicious and then you just drink that right up

49:52.160 --> 49:57.200
there is a cocktail you could make with shower water i mean by definition anything's a cocktail

49:57.200 --> 50:04.720
if you're drunk after but you you could make a cup come up with a cocktail that uses shower water

50:04.720 --> 50:10.000
and that's like the height of luxury i mean it mixes it right you know you put on like a hard

50:10.000 --> 50:15.600
spray and mix your cocktail that's what you call the drink the hard spray hard spray i love it

50:17.200 --> 50:23.520
you could uh put it on the a massaging shower head on there and that's hours of fun what do

50:23.520 --> 50:28.160
you mean you can put on your butt it feels real clean after because you spray your butt out when

50:28.160 --> 50:34.160
did this when did this happen it happens it happens i don't remember it happening

50:34.960 --> 50:45.520
i did you like the shower at my house uh i did yeah yeah oh no oh yes i'm an adult teen dirty boy

50:45.520 --> 50:52.320
