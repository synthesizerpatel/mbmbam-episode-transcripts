WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:04.720 --> 00:05.540
Sing it.

00:05.540 --> 00:06.380
Do what Justin's doing.

00:06.380 --> 00:07.880
But I don't know what song you're doing.

00:07.880 --> 00:08.880
You were doing you.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.680
He's just, he's making holiday notes.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.640
I'm doing old legs on the news.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.480
Okay.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.300
Okay.

00:14.300 --> 00:17.180
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:17.180 --> 00:19.100
Hey, everybody, it's Griffin McElroy from My Brother,

00:19.100 --> 00:20.340
My Brother, Me Brothers.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.340
And this is our annual candlelight special

00:22.340 --> 00:24.120
live in Huntington, West Virginia.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.060
Thank you to everybody who came out.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.620
Apologies to the ones that couldn't make it.

00:27.620 --> 00:28.860
We had a really great time.

00:28.860 --> 00:30.440
You're about to hear us open up the show

00:30.440 --> 00:32.440
with some beautiful carolers from Heart in the Park.

00:32.440 --> 00:34.740
It didn't come out super good in the final mix,

00:34.740 --> 00:36.920
but it was fun if you were there.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.540
So share this episode with your family.

00:38.540 --> 00:41.500
There's no, there's no swears in this episode.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.840
There were a couple of swears in the live environment,

00:43.840 --> 00:45.880
but we went ahead and nipped those in the bud.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.260
So go ahead and share this with Pee-Paw, Poop-Paw,

00:48.260 --> 00:50.720
Pump-Paw, and Pumper, your dog, Pumper.

00:50.720 --> 00:55.720
And joyous candle nights.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.480
That was just a nightmare.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.980
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.980
And their advice should never be followed.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.980
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

01:07.980 --> 01:12.980
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

01:12.980 --> 01:16.980
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only

01:16.980 --> 01:19.980
so the babies out there will know how cool they are

01:19.980 --> 01:21.980
when they see it.

01:21.980 --> 01:25.980
What's up, you cool babies?

01:25.980 --> 01:52.980
What's up, you cool babies?

01:52.980 --> 02:20.980
What's up, you cool babies?

02:20.980 --> 02:49.980
Hello.

02:49.980 --> 02:51.980
Intimate.

02:51.980 --> 02:52.980
Joyous candle nights.

02:52.980 --> 02:54.980
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

02:54.980 --> 03:00.980
Welcome, my brother, my brother, main advice show

03:00.980 --> 03:02.980
for the modern era.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.980
Feliz Navi candle nights.

03:04.980 --> 03:09.980
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:09.980 --> 03:11.980
I'm the sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy,

03:11.980 --> 03:17.980
and I want to apologize for, after all that stuff we planned,

03:17.980 --> 03:21.980
my introduction to you was I screamed the word intimate

03:21.980 --> 03:26.980
into my microphone, thereby unraveling the scarf

03:26.980 --> 03:28.980
of intimacy that we worked so hard to unravel.

03:28.980 --> 03:30.980
Griffin makes an excellent point, because what we've done

03:30.980 --> 03:33.980
is we planned carolers, we made a video,

03:33.980 --> 03:36.980
we had a whole thing, there was a grinch,

03:36.980 --> 03:40.980
and what we did is we planned right up until the start

03:40.980 --> 03:42.980
of my brother, my brother and me,

03:42.980 --> 03:45.980
and then we didn't plan anything after that.

03:45.980 --> 03:47.980
Oh, I planned something.

03:47.980 --> 03:50.980
It's right here in this bottle.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.980
I mean, I'm...

03:52.980 --> 03:55.980
You have a can in your hands.

03:55.980 --> 03:56.980
You planned poorly.

03:56.980 --> 03:57.980
Oh, all right.

03:57.980 --> 04:00.980
No, this, actually, this can is part of my new

04:00.980 --> 04:02.980
keep it cool...

04:02.980 --> 04:05.980
my new keep it cool live show lifestyle.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.980
Let me tell you what folks about it.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.980
It's called Wait to Make Some Room.

04:09.980 --> 04:10.980
Here's how it works.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.980
So let's say you do three shows as part of candle nights.

04:14.980 --> 04:19.980
How is this tree back?

04:19.980 --> 04:23.980
I bought that at the dollar store.

04:23.980 --> 04:25.980
What's up, house left?

04:25.980 --> 04:28.980
It's called Wait to Make Some Room.

04:28.980 --> 04:29.980
So here's how it works.

04:29.980 --> 04:30.980
It's called what?

04:30.980 --> 04:32.980
It's called Wait to Make Some Room.

04:32.980 --> 04:33.980
So let's say...

04:33.980 --> 04:34.980
Is that Simlish?

04:34.980 --> 04:36.980
Is that the Sims language?

04:36.980 --> 04:40.980
No, it's Wait till you make a some room.

04:40.980 --> 04:41.980
Here's how it works.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.980
Let's say you do three shows.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.980
You have a certain level of drunk

04:45.980 --> 04:47.980
that you need to be for each one.

04:47.980 --> 04:48.980
The first one, none.

04:48.980 --> 04:49.980
It's perfect.

04:49.980 --> 04:50.980
It's called Things So Much.

04:50.980 --> 04:51.980
It's perfect.

04:51.980 --> 04:55.980
Artistic creation that is a symbiosis of art and commerce.

04:55.980 --> 04:56.980
It's perfect.

04:56.980 --> 04:57.980
So you don't have to be drunk for that.

04:57.980 --> 05:01.980
Saw bones, drunk enough that I have to forget

05:01.980 --> 05:05.980
that I married way above my class.

05:05.980 --> 05:06.980
It's a certain level.

05:06.980 --> 05:08.980
But then, okay, so Wait to Make Some Room.

05:08.980 --> 05:09.980
Here's how it works.

05:09.980 --> 05:14.980
You pour the liquor into the can of soda,

05:14.980 --> 05:16.980
but here's the thing.

05:16.980 --> 05:20.980
Before you can pour the liquor in,

05:20.980 --> 05:22.980
you gotta wait to make some room.

05:22.980 --> 05:23.980
So you gotta...

05:23.980 --> 05:24.980
You have a one in, one out.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.980
Get out of here, regular liquid.

05:26.980 --> 05:27.980
You're pacing yourself.

05:27.980 --> 05:31.980
You're saying, whoa, whoa, 10-year bullet bourbon.

05:31.980 --> 05:33.980
I'm gonna enjoy some more of you.

05:33.980 --> 05:35.980
And I do want to be clear here.

05:35.980 --> 05:37.980
He's got 10-year-age bullet bourbon,

05:37.980 --> 05:41.980
which he is going to pour into Diet Dr. Batman.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.980
That's fine.

05:44.980 --> 05:45.980
Hey, eat a big'n, okay?

05:45.980 --> 05:47.980
How much was that bottle?

05:47.980 --> 05:48.980
Can I say that?

05:48.980 --> 05:49.980
Is this candlelight appropriate?

05:49.980 --> 05:51.980
Yeah, big'n is fine.

05:51.980 --> 05:53.980
That bottle, it's not important.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.980
It's the candlelight.

05:56.980 --> 05:59.980
So this is an advice show for the modern era.

05:59.980 --> 06:01.980
This is an episode where we're not gonna swear at all,

06:01.980 --> 06:03.980
we should point out, which is...

06:03.980 --> 06:05.980
We are gonna try really hard not to swear at all.

06:05.980 --> 06:15.980
Hi, Justin.

06:15.980 --> 06:19.980
And suddenly our production quality jumps up to 10.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.980
I was really worried when they started

06:21.980 --> 06:25.980
because I couldn't see Griffin super good.

06:25.980 --> 06:28.980
But then Jelson flipped that tiny plastic switch

06:28.980 --> 06:30.980
on that tiny plastic street lamp

06:30.980 --> 06:32.980
and suddenly all became clear.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.980
I had to explain it to the people at home

06:34.980 --> 06:36.980
who knew what we were talking about.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.980
This has been, fellas, I don't know how you feel about it,

06:38.980 --> 06:40.980
kind of a swearing day.

06:40.980 --> 06:41.980
Like if I made it to the end of this day

06:41.980 --> 06:44.980
under normal circumstances, it would be 9 p.m.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.980
I would put on my sweatshorts and I'd be like...

06:46.980 --> 06:48.980
Sworts.

06:48.980 --> 06:49.980
Shorts, I guess you could say.

06:49.980 --> 06:50.980
Sworts.

06:50.980 --> 06:51.980
Sure.

06:51.980 --> 06:54.980
And then I would just like kick up the ottoman

06:54.980 --> 06:56.980
and I'd be like, time to do some swearing.

06:56.980 --> 07:01.980
Let's start with my favorite ones.

07:01.980 --> 07:02.980
And then I'd say my...

07:02.980 --> 07:04.980
I wish I could tell you what my favorite ones,

07:04.980 --> 07:06.980
but I can't because it's Candle Nights

07:06.980 --> 07:08.980
and that's not what we're going for here.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.980
That's not what Candle Nights is about.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.980
I don't know what it is about, but I know it's not that.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.980
We'll find it by the end of the episode.

07:15.980 --> 07:17.980
Going back, listening to old Candle Nights episodes,

07:17.980 --> 07:19.980
I've realized they're beautiful

07:19.980 --> 07:21.980
and we've pitched this holiday in the perfect way,

07:21.980 --> 07:23.980
but none of us have had a moral revelation.

07:23.980 --> 07:26.980
Except maybe Justin at the end of Candle Nights 2014

07:26.980 --> 07:27.980
when three ghosts visited and were like,

07:27.980 --> 07:31.980
hey, drink less on stage.

07:31.980 --> 07:37.980
Only they didn't get around to you until like January 16th.

07:37.980 --> 07:38.980
You know what's funny?

07:38.980 --> 07:41.980
We'd ruin Candle Nights by swearing the show,

07:41.980 --> 07:45.980
but there's a lot of Christmas things that would be a lot better

07:45.980 --> 07:47.980
if they had swearing in them.

07:47.980 --> 07:48.980
I was thinking about this today

07:48.980 --> 07:51.980
when I was watching Emmett Otter's Junk Band Christmas.

07:51.980 --> 07:53.980
How much money would you give

07:53.980 --> 07:56.980
to see one of those little otters just be like,

07:56.980 --> 07:58.980
mother grabber.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.980
Like, but not, but they'd say the bad thing.

08:00.980 --> 08:01.980
The bad one.

08:01.980 --> 08:02.980
The bad one.

08:02.980 --> 08:03.980
Should we do some...

08:03.980 --> 08:04.980
What if Scrooge...

08:04.980 --> 08:05.980
Oh, there's more. Okay.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.980
What if Scrooge is just like, they're like,

08:07.980 --> 08:09.980
can we have some money, Scrooge?

08:09.980 --> 08:11.980
And he was like, son of a...

08:11.980 --> 08:12.980
And then he said the rest of it.

08:12.980 --> 08:16.980
The next word that comes in that usually at the end of it.

08:16.980 --> 08:19.980
This is an advice show.

08:19.980 --> 08:22.980
Don't laugh.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.980
My family is doing a gift exchange this year

08:24.980 --> 08:28.980
and my sister-in-law, as of last March, is buying a present.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.980
A cast iron skillet.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.980
Spoilers, come on.

08:33.980 --> 08:34.980
For my wife.

08:34.980 --> 08:35.980
Save that for the end of the question.

08:35.980 --> 08:36.980
You don't know how to build suspense.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.980
By the way, I know you've been wondering.

08:39.980 --> 08:43.980
It's a cast iron skillet.

08:43.980 --> 08:45.980
My wife's Christmas list did not specify

08:45.980 --> 08:47.980
the type of cast iron skillet that she would like.

08:47.980 --> 08:48.980
Rookie mistake.

08:48.980 --> 08:51.980
But knowing her, I have reason to think

08:51.980 --> 08:53.980
she would prefer a different type

08:53.980 --> 08:55.980
than the one that was purchased.

08:55.980 --> 08:56.980
Brief sidebar.

08:56.980 --> 08:59.980
What character traits?

08:59.980 --> 09:03.980
I know that she hates Mondays and loves chocolate.

09:03.980 --> 09:06.980
So she wants a Dutch oven.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.980
Not a cast iron skillet.

09:08.980 --> 09:09.980
It could be.

09:09.980 --> 09:12.980
You could have a cast iron Dutch oven skillet.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.980
That's what you have an issue with.

09:15.980 --> 09:18.980
Not that somebody wants a cast iron skillet.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.980
Just not that cast iron skillet.

09:21.980 --> 09:22.980
If you can't figure it out on your own,

09:22.980 --> 09:23.980
it doesn't mean anything.

09:23.980 --> 09:24.980
It doesn't mean anything.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.980
You know I only like ceramic handles.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.980
That's one of the things about me is I love ceramic handles.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.980
I said ceramic handles three times

09:31.980 --> 09:34.980
because I worried it would sound like ceramic candles,

09:34.980 --> 09:35.980
and that doesn't make any sense.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.980
A sincere concern.

09:37.980 --> 09:38.980
Thank God you cleared that up.

09:38.980 --> 09:39.980
Welcome, by the way.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.980
Welcome behind the veil.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.980
But I have reason to think that my sister-in-law

09:43.980 --> 09:45.980
would prefer a different type than the one that was purchased.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.980
I'm not about to ask my sister-in-law to return it

09:47.980 --> 09:48.980
and get a different one.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.980
But is it okay for us to return it

09:51.980 --> 09:53.980
and get a different one ourselves

09:53.980 --> 09:55.980
once the present has been opened

09:55.980 --> 09:57.980
and thank yous have been given, et cetera?

09:57.980 --> 09:59.980
It might not be an issue for most people,

09:59.980 --> 10:02.980
but since my sister-in-law is relatively new to the family,

10:02.980 --> 10:06.980
I don't want to do anything that might accidentally insult her.

10:06.980 --> 10:08.980
And I know this is getting long, but hang in there with me.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.980
There's a twist.

10:10.980 --> 10:14.980
And she will know if we do this because my brother, her husband...

10:14.980 --> 10:17.980
He's an octopus.

10:17.980 --> 10:19.980
Why would she be an octopus?

10:19.980 --> 10:20.980
It's just a better twist than the twisted.

10:20.980 --> 10:22.980
Go ahead.

10:22.980 --> 10:24.980
My brother... You've ruined the tension.

10:24.980 --> 10:25.980
This isn't you.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.980
Build it back up. Start at the beginning.

10:28.980 --> 10:31.980
It was a dark and stormy night.

10:31.980 --> 10:32.980
Call me Ishmael.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.980
What's up with cast iron skillets?

10:35.980 --> 10:36.980
It was the best of times.

10:36.980 --> 10:39.980
It was the worst of skillets.

10:39.980 --> 10:41.980
Okay.

10:41.980 --> 10:44.980
Okay.

10:44.980 --> 10:45.980
Pick it up.

10:45.980 --> 10:46.980
Let's take it from...

10:46.980 --> 10:47.980
And she will know.

10:47.980 --> 10:48.980
Reset to one.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.980
Let's take it from the exact word I stopped at.

10:51.980 --> 10:56.980
She will know if we do this because my brother, her husband,

10:56.980 --> 11:01.980
and I share an Amazon account.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.980
What do you think, brothers?

11:03.980 --> 11:05.980
Should I return the present and restrain the relationship

11:05.980 --> 11:07.980
or should I leave well enough alone?

11:07.980 --> 11:10.980
And that's from sauteing in South Bend.

11:10.980 --> 11:11.980
Can I just say...

11:11.980 --> 11:13.980
Are you here sauteing in South Bend?

11:13.980 --> 11:14.980
Are you?

11:14.980 --> 11:15.980
No.

11:15.980 --> 11:18.980
I'm deeply in love with the audience reaction.

11:18.980 --> 11:19.980
Very much.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.980
You guys reacted like a Spanish soap opera.

11:22.980 --> 11:23.980
Ooh.

11:23.980 --> 11:24.980
Die off me.

11:24.980 --> 11:25.980
Ooh.

11:25.980 --> 11:26.980
Whoa.

11:26.980 --> 11:30.980
Because that's what I wanted you to do and you did.

11:30.980 --> 11:31.980
You did.

11:31.980 --> 11:38.980
I think it's busted how everybody thinks all commerce...

11:38.980 --> 11:39.980
Why is everyone laughing?

11:39.980 --> 11:42.980
Did I swear?

11:42.980 --> 11:44.980
I think it's busted how everybody thinks all commerce

11:44.980 --> 11:45.980
has to go through Amazon.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.980
I think they're laughing because you said busted

11:47.980 --> 11:55.980
like a character on Ghost Rider.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.980
Hey, gang.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.980
Hey, gang.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.980
What's Ghost Rider spelling on the wall?

12:02.980 --> 12:04.980
We've got to bust this...

12:04.980 --> 12:06.980
Anyway.

12:06.980 --> 12:09.980
Take it from me, Sheldon Turnipseed,

12:09.980 --> 12:12.980
the actual name of a person on Ghost Rider,

12:12.980 --> 12:16.980
Sheldon Turnipseed.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.980
I forget what I was going to say, fellas.

12:19.980 --> 12:20.980
I think it's...

12:20.980 --> 12:21.980
Made some room.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.980
I think it's bad and wrong.

12:23.980 --> 12:24.980
You poured it into a cup.

12:24.980 --> 12:27.980
That's a cheating version of making room.

12:27.980 --> 12:28.980
I think it's...

12:28.980 --> 12:29.980
No, I'm going to go with the original.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.980
I think it's busted how everybody thinks all

12:31.980 --> 12:33.980
monetary transactions have to go through Amazon

12:33.980 --> 12:37.980
and you got to do a street return.

12:37.980 --> 12:39.980
Just take this new cast iron skillet thing

12:39.980 --> 12:42.980
into Pullman Square Plaza and just carry it around

12:42.980 --> 12:45.980
saying like, who wants this skillet?

12:45.980 --> 12:47.980
No.

12:47.980 --> 12:50.980
Your problem is no one wants...

12:50.980 --> 12:52.980
And correct me if I'm wrong here, audience.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.980
No one wants a new cast iron skillet.

12:54.980 --> 12:55.980
Right.

12:55.980 --> 12:56.980
Like, what's the fun of that?

12:56.980 --> 12:57.980
You need it preceded.

12:57.980 --> 12:59.980
You want that stank fake thing.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.980
You want your great-grandmother's old

13:01.980 --> 13:02.980
busted skillet.

13:02.980 --> 13:03.980
Travis Patrick!

13:03.980 --> 13:04.980
Oh, no!

13:04.980 --> 13:05.980
No, you can say that on TV.

13:05.980 --> 13:06.980
No, three strikes.

13:06.980 --> 13:07.980
Three strikes.

13:07.980 --> 13:08.980
That's one.

13:08.980 --> 13:09.980
You can say that on TV.

13:09.980 --> 13:10.980
Three strikes.

13:10.980 --> 13:13.980
Your old donkey skillet.

13:13.980 --> 13:16.980
You want a skillet so old that something in it

13:16.980 --> 13:23.980
at one point had a racist slang name, right?

13:23.980 --> 13:25.980
Sorry, grandma, did you...

13:25.980 --> 13:28.980
Do you mean bacon?

13:28.980 --> 13:30.980
Sorry, wait, grandma.

13:30.980 --> 13:33.980
Did you mean to say bacon just then

13:33.980 --> 13:36.980
instead of the thing that you did say?

13:36.980 --> 13:41.980
Because that's not what we call it ever.

13:41.980 --> 13:45.980
This is polite society.

13:45.980 --> 13:50.980
Could you take it to like Cluckers or something

13:50.980 --> 13:52.980
and have them just like...

13:52.980 --> 13:53.980
DJ Cluckers.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.980
You mean Roosters.

13:55.980 --> 13:56.980
It's not...

13:56.980 --> 13:58.980
No, we don't want to get sued.

13:58.980 --> 14:01.980
Anybody here eat at Roosters since you've been here?

14:01.980 --> 14:02.980
Yeah, what's up?

14:02.980 --> 14:03.980
It's like half our audience.

14:03.980 --> 14:04.980
How did that happen?

14:04.980 --> 14:06.980
Jason, don't raise your hand.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
Of course you've eaten at Roosters.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.980
They got a lot of TVs, right?

14:10.980 --> 14:11.980
You were saying?

14:11.980 --> 14:12.980
Yeah.

14:12.980 --> 14:13.980
You were saying?

14:13.980 --> 14:14.980
T-Fried TV.

14:14.980 --> 14:15.980
We'll talk about hunting stuff later.

14:15.980 --> 14:16.980
Go ahead.

14:16.980 --> 14:17.980
Take the pan to Roosters.

14:17.980 --> 14:18.980
Say, can you just dunk this?

14:18.980 --> 14:21.980
Give it a speedy crusting.

14:21.980 --> 14:24.980
Maybe one of the chefs puts it down his shirt

14:24.980 --> 14:27.980
for a workday and you get that natural...

14:27.980 --> 14:31.980
That increases the price by 25 American dollars.

14:31.980 --> 14:35.980
You got to put some sweat equity into it.

14:35.980 --> 14:38.980
Literal, literal sweat equity.

14:38.980 --> 14:40.980
Quick poll.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.980
Quick poll of this table.

14:42.980 --> 14:43.980
Griffin, Justin.

14:43.980 --> 14:44.980
Yeah.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.980
How much would you pay for a cast iron skillet?

14:46.980 --> 14:48.980
Do not answer audience.

14:48.980 --> 14:49.980
Why can't they?

14:49.980 --> 14:50.980
You're being really rude.

14:50.980 --> 14:51.980
Because...

14:51.980 --> 14:52.980
I want you to answer.

14:52.980 --> 14:53.980
There's hundreds of people here.

14:53.980 --> 14:54.980
You just pull...

14:54.980 --> 14:55.980
I'm going to pull them in a second.

14:55.980 --> 14:56.980
Okay, raise your hand.

14:56.980 --> 14:57.980
This is going on.

14:57.980 --> 14:58.980
Okay, let's do this.

14:58.980 --> 14:59.980
Raise your hand if you pay $10

14:59.980 --> 15:00.980
and then we'll just go up in value.

15:00.980 --> 15:01.980
No, why would we do this?

15:01.980 --> 15:02.980
And put it down.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.980
Sia, okay, I see like one...

15:04.980 --> 15:05.980
Bad start.

15:05.980 --> 15:06.980
Bad long game.

15:06.980 --> 15:07.980
Okay, 20.

15:07.980 --> 15:08.980
Let's just get to the joke.

15:08.980 --> 15:10.980
If there's a joke, God help me, please just say it.

15:10.980 --> 15:13.980
No, my point was is that I think that in this day and age,

15:13.980 --> 15:14.980
if you went up to someone and said,

15:14.980 --> 15:17.980
I will sell you this cast iron skillet for $25,

15:17.980 --> 15:18.980
they would be like, yeah.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.980
On the street, homie?

15:20.980 --> 15:21.980
What's your fear?

15:21.980 --> 15:24.980
That you're getting a knockoff cast iron skillet?

15:24.980 --> 15:27.980
That it's not name brand?

15:27.980 --> 15:32.980
Hey, why is Paula Deen spelled with four E's?

15:32.980 --> 15:36.980
I like how her face is printed on it, for sure.

15:36.980 --> 15:38.980
This is a Paolo Deen.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.980
That can't be right.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.980
This is one Pablo Deen.

15:42.980 --> 15:46.980
It doesn't even make sense.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.980
Hey, does anybody want a Yahoo answer

15:48.980 --> 15:52.980
from the Yahoo Answers website or service?

15:52.980 --> 15:53.980
If you're unfamiliar,

15:53.980 --> 15:56.980
we take questions from the Yahoo Answers service

15:56.980 --> 16:01.980
and try to answer them before everybody on earth did it.

16:01.980 --> 16:02.980
Fallon.

16:02.980 --> 16:03.980
I know he's here.

16:03.980 --> 16:04.980
If you're here.

16:04.980 --> 16:05.980
If you're here, Fallon.

16:05.980 --> 16:06.980
Eyes on you, buddy.

16:06.980 --> 16:07.980
No, no, don't boo.

16:07.980 --> 16:08.980
He's adorable.

16:08.980 --> 16:09.980
He's a great guy.

16:09.980 --> 16:10.980
All right, let's do the thing.

16:10.980 --> 16:11.980
Send in by level 9,000.

16:11.980 --> 16:13.980
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport, thank you.

16:13.980 --> 16:16.980
Sure you're here?

16:16.980 --> 16:17.980
He's usually here.

16:17.980 --> 16:18.980
No, that would be amazing.

16:18.980 --> 16:20.980
No, that's too far for him to come here.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.980
We'll find him out next year.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.980
At the top of the Yahoo page,

16:23.980 --> 16:25.980
there's a little promotion that says,

16:25.980 --> 16:27.980
get double points throughout December on Answers.

16:27.980 --> 16:28.980
Is it time for me?

16:28.980 --> 16:31.980
Is this the time to strike and become an active member?

16:31.980 --> 16:33.980
I take so much from Yahoo Answers.

16:33.980 --> 16:36.980
Is it time to put them back into the ecosystem?

16:36.980 --> 16:37.980
Give.

16:37.980 --> 16:39.980
I worry that you'll draw too much attention to yourself.

16:39.980 --> 16:40.980
That's a good point.

16:40.980 --> 16:42.980
I don't want to poison the well.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.980
This one's asked by a Yahoo Answers user.

16:44.980 --> 16:49.980
It's anonymous and for good reason.

16:49.980 --> 16:54.980
We'll call him Purvis Asks.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.980
What?

16:56.980 --> 16:57.980
It's a name.

16:57.980 --> 17:00.980
Purvis Asks.

17:00.980 --> 17:04.980
Why am I attracted to the weight gain belly scene

17:04.980 --> 17:11.980
from the movie The Santa Clause?

17:11.980 --> 17:13.980
I'm so happy.

17:13.980 --> 17:15.980
How's your candle lights?

17:15.980 --> 17:18.980
Mine's good so far.

17:18.980 --> 17:20.980
I'm a straight male.

17:20.980 --> 17:21.980
Always have been.

17:21.980 --> 17:22.980
There's no doubt to that.

17:22.980 --> 17:27.980
Maybe slight confusion.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.980
Wait, okay, maybe slightly what?

17:30.980 --> 17:31.980
I'm a straight male.

17:31.980 --> 17:32.980
Always have been.

17:32.980 --> 17:33.980
There's no doubt about that.

17:33.980 --> 17:36.980
Maybe slight confusion.

17:36.980 --> 17:37.980
Just like Oni.

17:37.980 --> 17:40.980
There's a backspace key on your keyboard.

17:40.980 --> 17:41.980
There's no doubt.

17:41.980 --> 17:42.980
There is.

17:42.980 --> 17:43.980
Too late now.

17:43.980 --> 17:44.980
You know what?

17:44.980 --> 17:45.980
Don't read that last sentence.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.980
I want that stricken from the Yahoo record.

17:48.980 --> 17:52.980
Now that I think about it, I'm dated exclusively men.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.980
I didn't see where that would be confusing.

17:54.980 --> 17:56.980
Yeah, I can see why this would be confusing.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.980
I'm attracted to the whole weight gain fetish thing

17:59.980 --> 18:01.980
among women and only women.

18:01.980 --> 18:04.980
Nothing crazy like serious gaining,

18:04.980 --> 18:07.980
but a little bit of chub around girls' stomachs

18:07.980 --> 18:10.980
that create a little gut is attractive to me,

18:10.980 --> 18:11.980
and I didn't read this part,

18:11.980 --> 18:15.980
and I'm uncomfortable on the stage now.

18:15.980 --> 18:23.980
The next part's too gross to read.

18:23.980 --> 18:27.980
When I say gross, all right, the humiliation factor

18:27.980 --> 18:29.980
and seeing the girls act or whatever

18:29.980 --> 18:33.980
and hearing dialogue or monologue gets me aroused a good bit.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.980
All right, let the record show there were no bad words

18:36.980 --> 18:38.980
in what Griffin just said.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.980
But I would say mature concepts.

18:40.980 --> 18:42.980
Challenging ideas.

18:42.980 --> 18:47.980
Mostly just the idea of being aroused during a monologue.

18:47.980 --> 18:50.980
You didn't specify the topic either.

18:50.980 --> 18:51.980
My question.

18:51.980 --> 18:52.980
Can we take our robes off yet?

18:52.980 --> 18:53.980
I need to warp.

18:53.980 --> 18:57.980
Pretty hot.

18:57.980 --> 18:58.980
Cool.

18:58.980 --> 19:04.980
My question is why for that particular scene only

19:04.980 --> 19:05.980
do I get a similar feeling?

19:05.980 --> 19:09.980
If memory serves in the Santa Claus with any,

19:09.980 --> 19:11.980
there are several scenes where Tim Allen.

19:11.980 --> 19:14.980
No, there is one specific where I believe he turns,

19:14.980 --> 19:19.980
I'm sorry, profile, and in the mirror watches

19:19.980 --> 19:22.980
like buttons pop off his shirt as he like.

19:22.980 --> 19:24.980
Oh, slow down.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.980
Oh, mommy.

19:27.980 --> 19:29.980
Again, again.

19:29.980 --> 19:31.980
If you'll remember the scene,

19:31.980 --> 19:34.980
he then turns full onto the camera

19:34.980 --> 19:36.980
and does this for 15 minutes.

19:36.980 --> 19:37.980
So you can understand where.

19:37.980 --> 19:40.980
As he just gets bigger and bigger.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.980
Bigger and bigger.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.980
Sorry, one second.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.980
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.980
Did everybody get that on Twitter?

19:48.980 --> 19:50.980
I'll do it one more time.

19:50.980 --> 19:51.980
Why?

19:51.980 --> 19:53.980
Why is any of this?

19:53.980 --> 19:58.980
Yeah.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.980
Justin is putting this on Twitter.

20:00.980 --> 20:01.980
Get your cameras out.

20:01.980 --> 20:05.980
That's because it's ethically bad.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.980
It's ethically bad for them to do that thing you said.

20:08.980 --> 20:12.980
So Tim Allen, I think what you've got here is a,

20:12.980 --> 20:15.980
you've got a lot of ideas that we're growing up.

20:15.980 --> 20:16.980
A lot of cross wires.

20:16.980 --> 20:17.980
A lot of cross wires, right?

20:17.980 --> 20:18.980
Everybody loves Santa.

20:18.980 --> 20:19.980
Ho, ho, ho.

20:19.980 --> 20:20.980
Green giant.

20:20.980 --> 20:21.980
Well, stole that.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.980
One of them stole it.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.980
And everybody loves Santa.

20:25.980 --> 20:26.980
Kids grow up loving Santa.

20:26.980 --> 20:28.980
And then Tim Allen.

20:28.980 --> 20:30.980
Need I say more?

20:30.980 --> 20:32.980
I hoped that you guys would say something else.

20:32.980 --> 20:34.980
America's sexiest comic.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.980
America's sexiest comic slash novelist.

20:37.980 --> 20:39.980
Oh my God, why am I here?

20:39.980 --> 20:40.980
Changed my life.

20:40.980 --> 20:42.980
It's why I'm a Zen Buddhist.

20:42.980 --> 20:43.980
I wish that was not true.

20:43.980 --> 20:44.980
Have you seen, yikes.

20:44.980 --> 20:46.980
Have you seen.

20:46.980 --> 20:49.980
Whoa, sorry, pump of the brakes.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.980
I just found out Travis got his religious theology

20:51.980 --> 20:52.980
from Tim Allen.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.980
Sorry, the show is canceled.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.980
We're only talking about this now.

20:56.980 --> 21:00.980
I believe I was 14 and his views really unlocked

21:00.980 --> 21:01.980
something within me.

21:01.980 --> 21:03.980
The first annual Allen Nights.

21:03.980 --> 21:07.980
Where's Travis?

21:07.980 --> 21:10.980
The show has come to a halt until you tell us more.

21:10.980 --> 21:12.980
Well, there's a metaphor running through the book

21:12.980 --> 21:18.980
of him trying to find the perfect hood ornament.

21:18.980 --> 21:22.980
The perfect chainsaw.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.980
And what's great about it and I feel truly moving

21:25.980 --> 21:28.980
is he finds what he thinks to be the perfect hood ornament

21:28.980 --> 21:30.980
like we all have.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.980
And then when he sees it the next morning in a clearer light

21:33.980 --> 21:37.980
he realizes it's not as beautiful as it was

21:37.980 --> 21:38.980
on the show floor.

21:38.980 --> 21:41.980
And he realizes that what is truly important in life

21:41.980 --> 21:44.980
is his wife and kids.

21:44.980 --> 21:47.980
And not a hood ornament.

21:47.980 --> 21:48.980
Okay, good.

21:48.980 --> 21:49.980
And I think.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.980
You read that and in the other hand.

21:51.980 --> 21:52.980
I was 14.

21:52.980 --> 21:53.980
Yes.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.980
In the other hand you were holding a big bag full

21:55.980 --> 21:57.980
of hood ornaments and you were like,

21:57.980 --> 21:59.980
what am I becoming?

21:59.980 --> 22:00.980
No.

22:00.980 --> 22:03.980
Why did I sort through so many of these?

22:03.980 --> 22:07.980
We are not talking about the matter at hand

22:07.980 --> 22:13.980
which is this person's Tim Allen chub chub.

22:13.980 --> 22:19.980
His double trouble chubble bubble.

22:19.980 --> 22:21.980
And I guess we're just not gonna.

22:21.980 --> 22:23.980
I would say this.

22:23.980 --> 22:27.980
If it is confusing for you, my 35 years on this planet

22:27.980 --> 22:29.980
have proven one thing and one thing only

22:29.980 --> 22:33.980
and that is not that hard to not see a Santa Claus movie.

22:33.980 --> 22:35.980
I was going to say, how often is this coming up

22:35.980 --> 22:37.980
that you're like in the middle of, I don't know,

22:37.980 --> 22:39.980
getting your license renewed at the DMV

22:39.980 --> 22:40.980
and you look up.

22:40.980 --> 22:41.980
Oh no, no.

22:41.980 --> 22:42.980
Excuse me.

22:42.980 --> 22:43.980
Can you change your channel please?

22:43.980 --> 22:46.980
That guy got too worked up.

22:46.980 --> 22:49.980
Yeah, and specifically not that scene, right?

22:49.980 --> 22:51.980
Like it's not the whole movie.

22:51.980 --> 22:55.980
It's just the part where he gets large and in charge, right?

22:55.980 --> 22:56.980
I got another question.

22:56.980 --> 22:58.980
I've bought a book for a friend.

22:58.980 --> 23:00.980
What time did we start by the way?

23:00.980 --> 23:01.980
It's been like four minutes.

23:01.980 --> 23:02.980
Go ahead.

23:02.980 --> 23:03.980
Okay.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.980
I bought a book for a friend as a gift

23:05.980 --> 23:07.980
this impending Candle Nights festivities.

23:07.980 --> 23:09.980
While waiting for the approaching holiday,

23:09.980 --> 23:10.980
I've been hearing amazing reviews

23:10.980 --> 23:14.980
and have been seeing it on a number of years best list.

23:14.980 --> 23:19.980
How morally reprehensible, sorry.

23:19.980 --> 23:24.980
How morally reprehensible is it to read a book

23:24.980 --> 23:27.980
prior to gifting?

23:27.980 --> 23:30.980
That's from Dishonorable in Davidson.

23:30.980 --> 23:34.980
Hey, all the information's used up again.

23:34.980 --> 23:38.980
There's only love left in this copy of Eat, Pray, Love.

23:38.980 --> 23:39.980
This is garbage.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.980
Use of all the story.

23:41.980 --> 23:42.980
Wait, why?

23:42.980 --> 23:44.980
No, don't contextualize it.

23:44.980 --> 23:46.980
The idea of if you said anything,

23:46.980 --> 23:49.980
like I bought a sweater for my friend and I wore it first,

23:49.980 --> 23:51.980
no one would be like, that's fine.

23:51.980 --> 23:52.980
You can wear it again.

23:52.980 --> 23:54.980
No, no.

23:54.980 --> 23:55.980
It's a present you bought for someone

23:55.980 --> 23:57.980
and you're not allowed to read it beforehand.

23:57.980 --> 23:58.980
What's the alternative?

23:58.980 --> 23:59.980
Go get it yourself.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.980
It's $6.99, it's a book.

24:01.980 --> 24:03.980
And that's, hey, hey everybody,

24:03.980 --> 24:05.980
if you're wondering why it seems a little hot this winter,

24:05.980 --> 24:08.980
it's because old climate change Trav

24:08.980 --> 24:10.980
is trying to just like waste,

24:10.980 --> 24:12.980
a lot of wastefulness, I think.

24:12.980 --> 24:19.980
In my book, in my America.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.980
Two more words about that, Paris Accord.

24:22.980 --> 24:24.980
What?

24:24.980 --> 24:26.980
Trying to get it fixed up.

24:26.980 --> 24:29.980
A little hot out there today.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.980
Dad has his head in his hands right now.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.980
That's not a joke.

24:34.980 --> 24:36.980
It seems a little steamy out there in my America.

24:36.980 --> 24:38.980
I don't know.

24:38.980 --> 24:39.980
Maybe everybody should like,

24:39.980 --> 24:41.980
there's a picture of me reading a book.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.980
Maybe you bought a book and they cut a tree down

24:45.980 --> 24:47.980
to make that book and they paved paradise

24:47.980 --> 24:48.980
and put up a parking lot.

24:48.980 --> 24:51.980
We got libraries for a reason.

24:51.980 --> 24:53.980
Go to the library and get it pre-loved too.

24:53.980 --> 24:55.980
Congratulations, Mr. McElroy.

24:55.980 --> 24:56.980
He's your library card.

24:56.980 --> 24:57.980
We're excited to have you.

24:57.980 --> 24:58.980
Thanks.

24:58.980 --> 25:02.980
I need books that nobody's touched.

25:02.980 --> 25:04.980
I need your new shipments.

25:04.980 --> 25:06.980
Well, you have like a new Highlights magazine.

25:06.980 --> 25:11.980
I guess if that's it.

25:11.980 --> 25:13.980
Here's some books about how bad climate change is.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.980
Nobody's touched those.

25:16.980 --> 25:19.980
Apparently.

25:19.980 --> 25:21.980
Let's change some minds.

25:21.980 --> 25:22.980
Let's change some minds.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.980
I'm sorry, I spilled on the thing.

25:25.980 --> 25:26.980
We got another Yahoo?

25:26.980 --> 25:27.980
Yeah, sure.

25:27.980 --> 25:28.980
Hit me.

25:28.980 --> 25:31.980
How about this one?

25:31.980 --> 25:34.980
This one, oh man, there's so many good ones.

25:34.980 --> 25:36.980
Thank you to everybody who sent these in.

25:36.980 --> 25:38.980
This one was sent in by Don Ames.

25:38.980 --> 25:39.980
Thank you, Don.

25:39.980 --> 25:40.980
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

25:40.980 --> 25:41.980
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

25:41.980 --> 25:43.980
I'm going to try refreshing the page.

25:43.980 --> 25:44.980
Do you have a Wi-Fi?

25:44.980 --> 25:45.980
I'm on that.

25:45.980 --> 25:47.980
Those fat pipes.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.980
Thank you, big Sandy.

25:50.980 --> 25:54.980
Sandy is the IT person here.

25:54.980 --> 25:58.980
Fun bit of trivia for people who live here.

25:58.980 --> 26:00.980
When we tell people we were doing the show, the Big Sandy,

26:00.980 --> 26:01.980
everybody was like, whoa.

26:01.980 --> 26:06.980
And then we had to tell them it's like, no, not where the He-Man

26:06.980 --> 26:09.980
live stunt show would be.

26:09.980 --> 26:11.980
Also, it's 1992.

26:11.980 --> 26:14.980
Yeah, not where they do World of Wheels and have all the trucks

26:14.980 --> 26:18.980
and tractors come in, but like over here where they do.

26:18.980 --> 26:23.980
In the prom crypt.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.980
This actually might be the room I had my prom in.

26:25.980 --> 26:26.980
Oh, yeah.

26:26.980 --> 26:31.980
No, this place is a regular like teen boner storage facility.

26:31.980 --> 26:35.980
There are prom boner ghosts all over this place.

26:35.980 --> 26:38.980
Oh, I just walked into a cold spot.

26:38.980 --> 26:44.980
I once saw American hero and West Virginia native Chuck Yeager,

26:44.980 --> 26:46.980
first man to break the sound barrier.

26:46.980 --> 26:47.980
What's up, Chuck?

26:47.980 --> 26:49.980
All right.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.980
I didn't make it, but you want to talk about cool intros.

26:52.980 --> 26:57.980
I want to tell Chuck Yeager, come onto this stage in sweats.

26:57.980 --> 26:59.980
Is my wife in this room?

26:59.980 --> 27:01.980
Am I lying, Sydney?

27:01.980 --> 27:05.980
Come on the stage in sweats and say, I got this video about me.

27:05.980 --> 27:07.980
We're going to watch that first.

27:07.980 --> 27:08.980
10 minutes.

27:08.980 --> 27:09.980
What, Chuck?

27:09.980 --> 27:13.980
Did you just start with a video about yourself that you started?

27:13.980 --> 27:15.980
He introed a video about himself.

27:15.980 --> 27:18.980
Sydney, am I lying?

27:18.980 --> 27:19.980
She says, no, I'm not lying.

27:19.980 --> 27:22.980
No, for those of you at home, no, he is not lying.

27:22.980 --> 27:24.980
Also, for those of you at home, no, we literally

27:24.980 --> 27:28.980
did that exact same thing when we introed our show, kind of.

27:28.980 --> 27:29.980
OK, but wait.

27:29.980 --> 27:30.980
Hold on, wait.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.980
No, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

27:32.980 --> 27:34.980
It's fine because we're not wearing sweatpants.

27:34.980 --> 27:36.980
Oh, dang.

27:36.980 --> 27:41.980
The difference is we were singing in Christmas pageants

27:41.980 --> 27:43.980
and he was breaking the sound barrier.

27:43.980 --> 27:45.980
So I feel like an a-hole.

27:45.980 --> 27:46.980
OK, go ahead.

27:46.980 --> 27:50.980
And now a 10 minute video of Chuck Yeager.

27:50.980 --> 27:51.980
I wish.

27:51.980 --> 27:52.980
He's a hero.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.980
He's got to be so much better than our stupid show.

27:54.980 --> 27:55.980
I don't know.

27:55.980 --> 27:56.980
Fascinating life, that guy.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.980
Chuck Yeager asks.

27:58.980 --> 28:00.980
Wouldn't it be great if he was like a 10 minute video of me

28:00.980 --> 28:03.980
knitting my true fashion?

28:03.980 --> 28:19.980
Chuck Yeager asks, who stole my Christmas goose?

28:19.980 --> 28:22.980
Who stole my Christmas goose?

28:22.980 --> 28:33.980
I built a fence around him and it was 12 feet high.

28:33.980 --> 28:34.980
Just now.

28:34.980 --> 28:35.980
Picture it now.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.980
Yeah, my reading comprehension is just now kicking.

28:37.980 --> 28:41.980
That's a high A fence.

28:41.980 --> 28:43.980
I built a fence around him and it was 12 feet high

28:43.980 --> 28:44.980
so he couldn't jump out.

28:44.980 --> 28:47.980
And I know he didn't run away, but he did.

28:47.980 --> 28:52.980
But he know, but he know there.

28:52.980 --> 28:53.980
And I can't find him anywhere.

28:53.980 --> 28:56.980
Who stole my Christmas goose?

28:56.980 --> 29:00.980
It was the Hanukkah Fox.

29:00.980 --> 29:05.980
The Hanukkah Fox snapped the neck of your Christmas goose

29:05.980 --> 29:08.980
with his powerful jaws.

29:08.980 --> 29:09.980
That's it.

29:09.980 --> 29:11.980
That's the shortest sentence in the English language

29:11.980 --> 29:13.980
that has all of the letters in it.

29:13.980 --> 29:22.980
The Hanukkah Fox snapped the Christmas goose's neck.

29:22.980 --> 29:23.980
Well, that was good.

29:23.980 --> 29:28.980
Listen, a goose is not a VTOL bird.

29:28.980 --> 29:31.980
It cannot just like, whoop, up and go.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.980
It needs a running start.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.980
If this is a small enough pen, then we have a locked room

29:35.980 --> 29:37.980
mystery on our hands now.

29:37.980 --> 29:42.980
When you first read this, I was literally picturing a fence

29:42.980 --> 29:45.980
just wide enough for the goose to be at it.

29:45.980 --> 29:47.980
Like the goose wouldn't even have room to turn around.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.980
We're talking about the barrel of a goose gun.

29:50.980 --> 29:51.980
Yes.

29:51.980 --> 29:56.980
But then I saw it 12 feet high, the circumference of a foot,

29:56.980 --> 29:59.980
tops, I don't know, the diameter of a bird.

29:59.980 --> 30:03.980
You built a goose silo for your one goose.

30:03.980 --> 30:06.980
This would all be a lot funnier if this wasn't how most

30:06.980 --> 30:07.980
of the chickens we eat are raised.

30:07.980 --> 30:08.980
Jiminy creaminy.

30:08.980 --> 30:09.980
What's up?

30:09.980 --> 30:12.980
And you know what we feed them?

30:12.980 --> 30:13.980
Fossil fuels.

30:13.980 --> 30:14.980
Think about it.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.980
A lot of agendas.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.980
Wake up.

30:17.980 --> 30:21.980
Wake up, it's a hotter one out there.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.980
We're boiling our geese alive.

30:24.980 --> 30:25.980
This is my new character.

30:25.980 --> 30:29.980
Guy laughing at a thing that isn't that funny.

30:29.980 --> 30:31.980
Who stole the Christmas goose?

30:31.980 --> 30:32.980
Sorry.

30:32.980 --> 30:33.980
Who stole the Christmas goose?

30:33.980 --> 30:38.980
Justin, you made a lot of jokes, but no firm denial.

30:38.980 --> 30:41.980
It was me.

30:41.980 --> 30:44.980
I stole the Christmas goose.

30:44.980 --> 30:45.980
I thought the goose stole it.

30:45.980 --> 30:47.980
It's going to be okay.

30:47.980 --> 30:48.980
Yeah, I know.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.980
It seems like quite the turn, but we got to end for it.

30:50.980 --> 30:51.980
Don't worry.

30:51.980 --> 30:52.980
We're not like J.J. Abrams.

30:52.980 --> 30:54.980
We got an actual outro for this thing.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.980
What the?

30:55.980 --> 30:56.980
What is going on?

30:56.980 --> 30:57.980
No, no, no, no, no.

30:57.980 --> 30:58.980
Shut up.

30:58.980 --> 30:59.980
It was a lost joke.

30:59.980 --> 31:00.980
It wasn't like a Star Wars thing.

31:00.980 --> 31:01.980
It was not topical.

31:01.980 --> 31:03.980
Don't worry.

31:03.980 --> 31:06.980
Don't get it twisted.

31:06.980 --> 31:07.980
Here's a true story.

31:07.980 --> 31:11.980
I ate goose for the first time two years ago.

31:11.980 --> 31:14.980
My mother-in-law made it for Christmas.

31:14.980 --> 31:21.980
And it tasted fine, but I realized that it is very hard to add a new animal to the list

31:21.980 --> 31:23.980
of animals you eat.

31:23.980 --> 31:28.980
Like, it's just like it moves them from one column into another column.

31:28.980 --> 31:29.980
Like, welcome.

31:29.980 --> 31:30.980
I'm eating you now.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.980
Welcome to the things I eat.

31:32.980 --> 31:34.980
Welcome to the Justin Tummy Club.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.980
Welcome to the Tummy Club.

31:37.980 --> 31:38.980
Put it back in.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.980
Now when I see you flocking through the sky, I think, mm-hmm.

31:42.980 --> 31:43.980
Yep.

31:43.980 --> 31:44.980
Yep.

31:44.980 --> 31:45.980
Why don't you flock on down here?

31:45.980 --> 31:47.980
When you do that, does it push another one out?

31:47.980 --> 31:50.980
I added goose, and now I can't have fish anymore.

31:50.980 --> 31:51.980
No.

31:51.980 --> 31:52.980
No, that's the bad thing.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.980
Eventually, it just becomes me, like, mad eater lad.

31:54.980 --> 31:55.980
Just like, I'll eat the mic.

31:55.980 --> 31:56.980
I don't care.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.980
So it's kind of like a weird version of the most dangerous game where you just have to

31:59.980 --> 32:02.980
keep eating until you've eaten the most dangerous animal, and then you have to eat man.

32:02.980 --> 32:03.980
The most delicious game.

32:03.980 --> 32:04.980
The most delicious game.

32:04.980 --> 32:09.980
And, like, Justin's great-great-great-great-grandchildren will be like, all right, capybara, you're the

32:09.980 --> 32:10.980
last one.

32:10.980 --> 32:12.980
Come on, it's on.

32:12.980 --> 32:14.980
The most elusive game, capybara.

32:14.980 --> 32:15.980
Come on, capybara.

32:15.980 --> 32:16.980
Well, no, they're the cutest game.

32:16.980 --> 32:17.980
Why would you want to eat one of those?

32:17.980 --> 32:21.980
But then you eat them, and you're like, I caught them all.

32:21.980 --> 32:22.980
I've had it all.

32:22.980 --> 32:26.980
Capybara, dolphin, bulbasaur, all of it.

32:26.980 --> 32:30.980
Time to turn in my tummy decks.

32:30.980 --> 32:31.980
All right.

32:31.980 --> 32:32.980
All right.

32:32.980 --> 32:33.980
This is moral.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.980
Science says that you're an animal, but I don't believe it.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.980
But there's only one way to settle this.

32:38.980 --> 32:39.980
Come on in.

32:39.980 --> 32:40.980
Come on in.

32:40.980 --> 32:41.980
The tummy's fine.

32:41.980 --> 32:45.980
Plankton, I'm just, I'm gonna hate this.

32:45.980 --> 32:48.980
But I gotta know.

32:48.980 --> 32:50.980
I can eat a billion of you at once.

32:50.980 --> 32:52.980
Think of the possibilities.

32:52.980 --> 32:57.980
Hey, hope everybody's having a real good time at this live show we recorded.

32:57.980 --> 33:04.980
Before we thank any of our sponsors, I want to say a huge thank you to Heart, the theater

33:04.980 --> 33:08.980
group that provided our carolers for us during the show.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.980
You didn't come in so great through the final mix.

33:10.980 --> 33:14.980
It was one of those, you had to be, one of those Patton and McElroy, you had to be there

33:14.980 --> 33:15.980
moments.

33:15.980 --> 33:20.980
But every summer they do theater in Huntington, and if you can get by, I think you're really

33:20.980 --> 33:21.980
gonna enjoy it.

33:21.980 --> 33:22.980
I love it.

33:22.980 --> 33:23.980
Two thumbs up.

33:23.980 --> 33:24.980
I love theater.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.980
I love Heart.

33:26.980 --> 33:27.980
I love Huntington.

33:27.980 --> 33:29.980
Last year they did a play that our nanny wrote.

33:29.980 --> 33:33.980
I want to say a big thank you also to Zip Recruiter.

33:33.980 --> 33:37.980
When you're short staffed, there's no time to deal with dozens of different job sites.

33:37.980 --> 33:43.980
With ziprecruiter.com, you can post to 100 plus job sites with one single click and be

33:43.980 --> 33:46.980
instantly matched to candidates from over six million resumes.

33:46.980 --> 33:47.980
I'm so hung over.

33:47.980 --> 33:51.980
I'm just realizing I'm so hung over from last squats.

33:51.980 --> 33:52.980
Look at me.

33:52.980 --> 33:53.980
We're all together right now.

33:53.980 --> 33:56.980
Day after candle lights, day one, when we did our live show.

33:56.980 --> 33:57.980
This is day zero.

33:57.980 --> 34:00.980
It's day zero, and now we're all together, and my brothers are watching me do my post

34:00.980 --> 34:01.980
hangover squats.

34:01.980 --> 34:02.980
Watch me now.

34:02.980 --> 34:03.980
Squat.

34:03.980 --> 34:04.980
That's one.

34:04.980 --> 34:05.980
Two.

34:05.980 --> 34:06.980
Reps.

34:06.980 --> 34:07.980
You keep squatting.

34:07.980 --> 34:08.980
Travis.

34:08.980 --> 34:09.980
You are doing an excellent plie.

34:09.980 --> 34:14.980
Zip Recruiter has been used by over 400 businesses, and you can try it, right?

34:14.980 --> 34:15.980
400,000.

34:15.980 --> 34:17.980
Well, it is also over 400.

34:17.980 --> 34:21.980
Okay, you are right, but the copy does say 400,000.

34:21.980 --> 34:24.980
Go to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

34:24.980 --> 34:28.980
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.980
No, Travis, you do it.

34:30.980 --> 34:31.980
Go.

34:31.980 --> 34:32.980
Burn it.

34:32.980 --> 34:33.980
Okay.

34:33.980 --> 34:34.980
Well, we also are sponsored this week by Harry's.

34:34.980 --> 34:40.980
You've heard us talk about Harry's before, but in case you haven't, Harry's Razors offer

34:40.980 --> 34:41.980
high quality shaves.

34:41.980 --> 34:43.980
It's better for your face and your wallet.

34:43.980 --> 34:48.980
Maybe you've gone to like, I don't know, a Walgreens CVS, and you're like, I need to

34:48.980 --> 34:49.980
get some razor blades.

34:49.980 --> 34:53.980
And the dude's like, all right, well, first you have to find me, and he hides in like

34:53.980 --> 34:57.980
the snack aisle, and then you gotta find him, and he unlocks the thing, and then he's like,

34:57.980 --> 35:00.980
these razor blades are gonna be $100.

35:00.980 --> 35:02.980
I haven't shaved in a long time.

35:02.980 --> 35:03.980
Okay, great.

35:03.980 --> 35:08.980
And so Harry's, in fact, is much cheaper, but way better.

35:08.980 --> 35:12.980
You can get a starter set for just $15, and that includes a razor, foaming shave gel,

35:12.980 --> 35:16.980
or shave cream, and three razor blades, plus free shipping.

35:16.980 --> 35:22.980
But if you go to harrys.com, you can get $5 off the starter set with the code MYBROTHER,

35:22.980 --> 35:23.980
all one word.

35:23.980 --> 35:25.980
Start shaving better today.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.980
Got a quick text.

35:27.980 --> 35:29.980
I got a message for Ian also.

35:29.980 --> 35:30.980
It wasn't in the text.

35:30.980 --> 35:31.980
Hey, it's Ian.

35:31.980 --> 35:32.980
I'm texting you.

35:32.980 --> 35:33.980
I got a message for Fiona.

35:33.980 --> 35:35.980
All right, so let me try again.

35:35.980 --> 35:36.980
I strike that, reverse it.

35:36.980 --> 35:37.980
Hey, it's Fiona.

35:37.980 --> 35:39.980
I was reading the phone upside down.

35:39.980 --> 35:40.980
Hey, it's Fiona.

35:40.980 --> 35:41.980
I got a message for Ian.

35:41.980 --> 35:47.980
The text says, wishing you the most magical birthday, wiggling to that nice blonde girl,

35:47.980 --> 35:49.980
and making prostitutes.

35:49.980 --> 35:52.980
Remember, someone is going to die today.

35:52.980 --> 35:53.980
What is this?

35:53.980 --> 35:56.980
It's not candle nights is what it isn't.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.980
I'm sure they didn't mean for this to go up on our candle nights.

35:58.980 --> 36:00.980
Travis is taking his shirt off.

36:00.980 --> 36:01.980
I love you guys so much.

36:01.980 --> 36:02.980
That's all right.

36:02.980 --> 36:12.980
Yeah, happy birthday, Ian, and a happy candle nights, and a happy wiggling, I suppose.

36:12.980 --> 36:13.980
Wiggling, happy wiggling.

36:13.980 --> 36:14.980
Travis, we got another message.

36:14.980 --> 36:15.980
Hit me, dude.

36:15.980 --> 36:21.980
This message is for Just Fisher Parentheses Done, and it's from Johnny Lev.

36:21.980 --> 36:26.980
To the best, best man there is, congrats on finally squeezing that baby out.

36:26.980 --> 36:31.980
Now that the whole preggo thing is over, and you're free of responsibility, you can spend

36:31.980 --> 36:35.980
all your time planning my bachelor party.

36:35.980 --> 36:36.980
Good work.

36:36.980 --> 36:37.980
You're the best.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.980
Does this get me out of babysitting?

36:39.980 --> 36:40.980
It does, Johnny.

36:40.980 --> 36:43.980
Congratulations, and joyous candle nights to everybody.

36:43.980 --> 36:46.980
Thanks again to everybody who came out to our show.

36:46.980 --> 36:47.980
We hope you had a lot of fun.

36:47.980 --> 36:48.980
We know we did.

36:48.980 --> 36:50.980
Let's get back into it.

36:50.980 --> 36:55.980
So one of the things heading into candle nights we discussed on the show was that we didn't

36:55.980 --> 36:58.980
know all that much about Hanukkah.

36:58.980 --> 37:03.980
As represented by the decorations on stage, we tried, and we failed.

37:03.980 --> 37:04.980
There's just none for sale.

37:04.980 --> 37:07.980
Dollar General, not a huge Hanukkah selection.

37:07.980 --> 37:12.980
That's a regional problem, and not really our problem.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.980
We tried.

37:14.980 --> 37:19.980
I've seen one delightful person here in a Hanukkah sweatshirt, and I appreciate that.

37:19.980 --> 37:20.980
Thank you.

37:20.980 --> 37:21.980
Oh, it lights up.

37:21.980 --> 37:22.980
How glorious.

37:22.980 --> 37:23.980
How wonderful.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.980
So I wanted to take a minute.

37:25.980 --> 37:27.980
I constructed a report.

37:27.980 --> 37:28.980
It wasn't even mine.

37:28.980 --> 37:29.980
Honestly, it wasn't even mine.

37:29.980 --> 37:34.980
I took it, I copied and pasted it from the internet, but it did have a lot of words that

37:34.980 --> 37:41.980
I didn't understand, so I had to translate them, and I would like to read it for you

37:41.980 --> 37:42.980
now.

37:42.980 --> 37:48.980
It's titled, Hanukkah, colon, history.

37:48.980 --> 37:56.980
Unlike many Jewish holidays, Hanukkah, also known as the festival of Lutah, is not mentioned

37:56.980 --> 37:57.980
in the Bible.

37:57.980 --> 38:03.980
The historical events upon which the celebration is based are recorded in Maccabees 1 and 2,

38:03.980 --> 38:10.980
two books contained within a later collection of writings known as the Poopkins.

38:10.980 --> 38:16.980
Although Hanukkah is considered a minor Jewish festival, today it ranks, along with squeegee

38:16.980 --> 38:21.980
and squelch, as one of the most beloved Jewish family holidays.

38:21.980 --> 38:30.980
In the year 168 BCE, the hungover Syrian tyrant, Don Cheadle, sent his soldiers to Jerusalem.

38:30.980 --> 38:32.980
The Syrians desecrated the pizza roll.

38:32.980 --> 38:37.980
Will you guys just raise your hands if it gets anti-Semitic, like a little, like when

38:37.980 --> 38:38.980
you're anti-Semitic...

38:38.980 --> 38:40.980
Not you in the back.

38:40.980 --> 38:48.980
Cheadle also abolished taters, outlawing the observance of Shabbat and the festivals,

38:48.980 --> 38:54.980
as well as booty-touching. Altars and idols were set up for the worship of Greek gods,

38:54.980 --> 39:00.980
and he offered Jews two options, conversion or Nantucket.

39:00.980 --> 39:10.980
On the 25th day of the Hebrew month of croissants, in 168 BCE, the pizza roll was renamed for

39:10.980 --> 39:13.980
the Greek god Tim Curry.

39:13.980 --> 39:20.980
A resistance movement led by a priestly family known as Jingles, or Maccabees, developed

39:20.980 --> 39:22.980
against the cruelty of Cheadle.

39:22.980 --> 39:26.980
The head of the family was Bodacious, an elderly man.

39:26.980 --> 39:29.980
I'm actually learning a lot from this.

39:29.980 --> 39:34.980
His son, Hamilton, became the chief strategist.

39:34.980 --> 39:35.980
That's not one that's added in.

39:35.980 --> 39:37.980
That's just a word I can't say.

39:37.980 --> 39:40.980
Yeah, just try to say strategist, but it makes it up.

39:40.980 --> 39:43.980
Oh, I didn't say it. Never mind. I'm an idiot.

39:43.980 --> 39:49.980
And military leader of the resistance, though outnumbered, Hamilton Jingles and his fighters

39:49.980 --> 39:54.980
miraculously won two major battles, routing the Syrians sloppily.

39:54.980 --> 40:00.980
Hanukkah, which means moist, is the festival...

40:00.980 --> 40:04.980
A lot of hands on that one. That one had an impact on the audience.

40:04.980 --> 40:09.980
...is the festival that commemorates the purification and undulation of the Temple.

40:09.980 --> 40:12.980
Following, and this, not a word, changed.

40:12.980 --> 40:16.980
Following the defilement caused by the Greeks during their occupation of the Holy Place.

40:16.980 --> 40:21.980
Today, the holiday reminds Jews to rededicate themselves to stand against forces that would

40:21.980 --> 40:25.980
destroy Judaism and to keep alive the flame of Jewish religion, culture, and people.

40:25.980 --> 40:27.980
No, you really are just going full blown Wikipedia right now.

40:27.980 --> 40:30.980
So that it may be passed on to the next generation.

40:30.980 --> 40:31.980
The end.

40:31.980 --> 40:36.980
According to the legend, when the Maccabees entered the Temple and began to reclaim it

40:36.980 --> 40:43.980
from the Greeks, they immediately re-lit their nur-tamin, which translates to...

40:43.980 --> 40:46.980
Yes, boo louder. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me that energy.

40:46.980 --> 40:52.980
...which translates to lugubrious milquetoast, which burned constantly in the Temple and

40:52.980 --> 40:55.980
has a parallel in our synagogues to this day.

40:55.980 --> 40:58.980
In the Temple, they found a single jar of calamari...

40:58.980 --> 41:01.980
There's whaling. There's actual whaling.

41:01.980 --> 41:04.980
...which was sufficient for only one day.

41:04.980 --> 41:10.980
The gallivant, who was sent to secure additional calamari, took eight days to gavort, and

41:10.980 --> 41:14.980
miraculously, the single jar of oil continued to hogwash until his return.

41:14.980 --> 41:16.980
I am feeding on it.

41:16.980 --> 41:22.980
The rabbis of the Talmud attributed the eight days of Hanukkah to the miracle of this single

41:22.980 --> 41:25.980
jar of calamari.

41:25.980 --> 41:32.980
The end.

41:32.980 --> 41:36.980
I'm gonna say something a little contentious here.

41:36.980 --> 41:38.980
I don't take it out of context, ever.

41:38.980 --> 41:44.980
But if it means that that hadn't just happened, then I wish Hanukkah had never been invented.

41:44.980 --> 41:48.980
That's how... I gotta hand raise on that. I guess that's fair.

41:48.980 --> 41:52.980
If you could save us from that, I think it would be worth it.

41:52.980 --> 41:54.980
I thought that was informative and insightful.

41:54.980 --> 41:58.980
You did go on a weirdly, like, educational run there.

41:58.980 --> 42:02.980
Like a Christmas special from the mid-80s. I wanted there to be one moment where everyone

42:02.980 --> 42:06.980
went, huh, and then came back to hating it.

42:06.980 --> 42:11.980
And then Screech still does run in after they learn a lesson about drugs.

42:11.980 --> 42:14.980
And here's Screech right now.

42:14.980 --> 42:16.980
I'm sorry about booing you.

42:16.980 --> 42:17.980
That's all right.

42:17.980 --> 42:21.980
This past Thanksgiving, my partner and I celebrated Thanksgiving at my parent's parent...

42:21.980 --> 42:24.980
I'm sorry, partner's parent's house.

42:24.980 --> 42:27.980
The parents live locally, but since we wanted to spend Friday with them as well...

42:27.980 --> 42:31.980
You stuttered through a phrase that I really enjoy.

42:31.980 --> 42:33.980
My partner's parents...

42:33.980 --> 42:34.980
After that.

42:34.980 --> 42:36.980
I celebrated Thanksgiving at my partner's parents...

42:36.980 --> 42:38.980
Just do the whole thing.

42:38.980 --> 42:42.980
This past Thanksgiving, my partner and I celebrated Thanksgiving at my partner's parent's house.

42:42.980 --> 42:45.980
The parents live locally, but since we wanted to spend Friday with them as well, and since

42:45.980 --> 42:49.980
we don't have our own car, we thought it might be best to just sleep over Thursday night.

42:49.980 --> 42:54.980
Thursday night is highlighted here on Travis's iPad in case he wants to make an appointment for them.

42:54.980 --> 42:57.980
However, maybe just stop by, see how things are going.

42:57.980 --> 43:02.980
However, we were informed by the parents that it is expected that we would not share a bed.

43:02.980 --> 43:04.980
My partner and I have been together for nine months.

43:04.980 --> 43:06.980
We're both well into adulthood.

43:06.980 --> 43:08.980
We have completely lost this audience.

43:08.980 --> 43:09.980
And the...

43:09.980 --> 43:11.980
Yeah, because it's like not funny.

43:11.980 --> 43:12.980
I was...

43:12.980 --> 43:13.980
Oh.

43:13.980 --> 43:14.980
Sad libs is a bad bit.

43:14.980 --> 43:16.980
Nobody likes it.

43:16.980 --> 43:17.980
So say we all.

43:17.980 --> 43:19.980
My partner and I have been together for nine months.

43:19.980 --> 43:20.980
We're both well into adulthood.

43:20.980 --> 43:22.980
Parents like me are progressive in most every other way.

43:22.980 --> 43:27.980
My partner and I are, of course, classy enough to not get busy on the family room futon during our stay.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.980
But we're not married and have no plans for it.

43:30.980 --> 43:34.980
So I'm not sure when circumstances would change the parents' mind about this.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.980
And the problem is certain to rear its ugly head again.

43:37.980 --> 43:42.980
Brothers, how can I convince them to let us sleep how we are most comfortable?

43:42.980 --> 43:46.980
Seeking the solace of shared slumber in Cincinnati.

43:46.980 --> 43:52.980
What if your partner's parents are just saving this for a gift?

43:52.980 --> 43:57.980
So maybe not like 2019 under the candle night's bush.

43:57.980 --> 43:58.980
What's that?

43:58.980 --> 43:59.980
Oh, it's an envelope.

43:59.980 --> 44:01.980
Oh, no, it's probably a gift card at a Home Depot.

44:01.980 --> 44:03.980
Boo!

44:03.980 --> 44:04.980
But then you open it up.

44:04.980 --> 44:05.980
It's not.

44:05.980 --> 44:06.980
It's a little letter from your partner's parents.

44:06.980 --> 44:09.980
And it just says, go for it.

44:09.980 --> 44:17.980
Connect 4, do it!

44:17.980 --> 44:20.980
What if it just says, we know and we're cool?

44:20.980 --> 44:27.980
Because you have to assume at that point, 2019, three years, four years from now, they know they're doing it.

44:27.980 --> 44:29.980
I like more of a demand.

44:29.980 --> 44:30.980
Go for it!

44:30.980 --> 44:31.980
Do it!

44:31.980 --> 44:32.980
No.

44:32.980 --> 44:33.980
What's worse?

44:33.980 --> 44:34.980
Like what?

44:34.980 --> 44:35.980
That's worse, right?

44:35.980 --> 44:38.980
Definitely that's worse than saying like, go for it.

44:38.980 --> 44:41.980
You're cool.

44:41.980 --> 44:43.980
I want to say that I do like...

44:43.980 --> 44:47.980
Aren't you excited to be able to sleep like with the room as cold as you want and the fan on?

44:47.980 --> 44:50.980
Because I'd be like a little excited about that.

44:50.980 --> 44:53.980
Like, oh, I'm just gonna make it like 40 degrees in here.

44:53.980 --> 45:01.980
And my question is, if the debate is whether or not you can sleep on the family room futon together,

45:01.980 --> 45:09.980
if you're not allowed to sleep together, where do you end up if the family room futon is the best option?

45:09.980 --> 45:11.980
You're in the garage.

45:11.980 --> 45:14.980
Like what's the other option that you get secluded to?

45:14.980 --> 45:15.980
You're in the dog bed.

45:15.980 --> 45:22.980
You have to sleep with the parents.

45:22.980 --> 45:29.980
Meredith and Joey, I had a bad dream.

45:29.980 --> 45:32.980
That you guys are closed minded.

45:32.980 --> 45:38.980
Jeremy, we've laid some blankets on the floor and now you'll listen to us do it.

45:38.980 --> 45:39.980
Yeah, we just...

45:39.980 --> 45:40.980
No, no, no, no.

45:40.980 --> 45:42.980
This is how two adults make love.

45:42.980 --> 45:44.980
Take notes.

45:44.980 --> 45:45.980
Still no bad words.

45:45.980 --> 45:47.980
Just remember, no bad words.

45:47.980 --> 45:48.980
We're very progressive.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.980
We just want to make sure you know what you're doing in there.

45:51.980 --> 45:52.980
With it.

45:52.980 --> 45:55.980
Watch Meredith and Joey for a second.

45:55.980 --> 45:56.980
Sorry?

45:56.980 --> 45:58.980
You probably thought that was an affectation.

45:58.980 --> 46:02.980
Oh, that's her names with W's.

46:02.980 --> 46:05.980
We're very progressive parents.

46:05.980 --> 46:06.980
Well, now they're just...

46:06.980 --> 46:08.980
Yeah, that's doesn't mean.

46:08.980 --> 46:09.980
Do you guys want...

46:09.980 --> 46:12.980
How about we do one final yahoo and then we...

46:12.980 --> 46:13.980
Not the final yahoo.

46:13.980 --> 46:14.980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

46:14.980 --> 46:15.980
We'll do another yahoo.

46:15.980 --> 46:16.980
Okay.

46:16.980 --> 46:18.980
And then we'll turn it to the audience and do some audience questions.

46:18.980 --> 46:19.980
Okay.

46:19.980 --> 46:20.980
We'll just...

46:20.980 --> 46:21.980
Don't line up or anything.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.980
We'll just yell at you when you put your hands up and call you forward.

46:23.980 --> 46:27.980
Does everybody know the rule about questions at live shows?

46:27.980 --> 46:29.980
It's printed on the microphone.

46:29.980 --> 46:31.980
We brought no bummers with us, by the way.

46:31.980 --> 46:32.980
You can see it right there.

46:32.980 --> 46:34.980
And also no cursing.

46:34.980 --> 46:35.980
Yeah, no cursing.

46:35.980 --> 46:36.980
Yeah.

46:36.980 --> 46:37.980
I swan to John.

46:37.980 --> 46:38.980
You guys are going to think it's funny.

46:38.980 --> 46:42.980
I'm going to immortalize myself by ruining candle nights.

46:42.980 --> 46:43.980
No, I mean you will.

46:43.980 --> 46:45.980
Yeah, it'll work.

46:45.980 --> 46:50.980
For this room, but you don't make it on the recording or any podcast recording from now

46:50.980 --> 46:51.980
to the end of time.

46:51.980 --> 46:52.980
We got the juice to make that happen.

46:52.980 --> 46:53.980
You want to be on Marin?

46:53.980 --> 46:55.980
No dice.

46:55.980 --> 47:00.980
We'll find somebody who knows that guy and say, hey, they're off limits.

47:00.980 --> 47:01.980
I just want to send in...

47:01.980 --> 47:02.980
I just want to finish my plug.

47:02.980 --> 47:03.980
Thank you, Ear Trumpet Labs.

47:03.980 --> 47:04.980
They made that for us.

47:04.980 --> 47:05.980
Yeah, thank you.

47:05.980 --> 47:06.980
Beautiful microphones.

47:06.980 --> 47:07.980
No bummers.

47:07.980 --> 47:09.980
Sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

47:09.980 --> 47:13.980
Zoe Kinski.

47:13.980 --> 47:19.980
It's by Yahoo Answers user Passenger Wow Widow, which...

47:19.980 --> 47:20.980
Sorry?

47:20.980 --> 47:21.980
Oh, it's okay.

47:21.980 --> 47:23.980
World of Warcraft Widow is saying, okay.

47:23.980 --> 47:24.980
Wow.

47:24.980 --> 47:27.980
It's either ways, but it's better than like, wow, I'm a widow.

47:27.980 --> 47:28.980
Wow.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.980
Wow, you're a widow.

47:30.980 --> 47:31.980
Wow.

47:31.980 --> 47:33.980
Yeah, there's a little Christopher Walken in there.

47:33.980 --> 47:35.980
That's the only word I can do.

47:35.980 --> 47:39.980
If Dwight was here, he's got a pretty good walking, but my only walking is wow.

47:39.980 --> 47:40.980
Wow.

47:40.980 --> 47:42.980
All right.

47:42.980 --> 47:49.980
Passenger Wow Widow asks, if I am a super good girl, will Santa bring me Robert Downey

47:49.980 --> 47:52.980
Jr. for Christmas?

47:52.980 --> 47:59.980
What I love about this question is the thought of Santa showing up at Robert Downey Jr.'s

47:59.980 --> 48:02.980
house like, it's time.

48:02.980 --> 48:08.980
The bargain we made when I put you in Iron Man.

48:08.980 --> 48:11.980
Time to pay the piper who is Santa.

48:11.980 --> 48:14.980
And you know, I would like to think of RDJ the dude would go, I get it.

48:14.980 --> 48:15.980
You?

48:15.980 --> 48:16.980
I get it.

48:16.980 --> 48:17.980
RDJ.

48:17.980 --> 48:18.980
Sorry?

48:18.980 --> 48:19.980
Okay.

48:19.980 --> 48:20.980
RDJ.

48:20.980 --> 48:21.980
Your personal friend and mentor.

48:21.980 --> 48:23.980
I'm pretty Hollywood at this point.

48:23.980 --> 48:24.980
Yeah, sure.

48:24.980 --> 48:25.980
Then he would go, you're right.

48:25.980 --> 48:26.980
You're right.

48:26.980 --> 48:27.980
And just walk into the bag.

48:27.980 --> 48:30.980
No, this is on me.

48:30.980 --> 48:32.980
I've lived a good life.

48:32.980 --> 48:33.980
Could it be a?

48:33.980 --> 48:36.980
Tell Mark Ruffalo I said I love you.

48:36.980 --> 48:39.980
Could it be a Robert Downey Jr.?

48:39.980 --> 48:42.980
Hi, I'm Bob Downey the second.

48:42.980 --> 48:45.980
And I want to thank you for having me to your boudoir.

48:45.980 --> 48:51.980
I hope to show you some challenging yet comfortable lovemaking positions.

48:51.980 --> 48:53.980
Shall we begin with the smooches?

48:53.980 --> 48:57.980
Shall we begin with some heavy petty?

48:57.980 --> 49:00.980
I hear it's somebody's special day here.

49:00.980 --> 49:03.980
I heard you've been a very good girl.

49:03.980 --> 49:05.980
This beats the heck out of the tile store.

49:05.980 --> 49:11.980
Wow, I'm really excited to be the Bob Downey in your boudoir.

49:11.980 --> 49:17.980
Sorry, I don't know any other words for it other than boudoir.

49:17.980 --> 49:20.980
I meant to learn some, but I didn't.

49:20.980 --> 49:24.980
It's a busy season at the tile store.

49:24.980 --> 49:29.980
I was in a bicycle accident and I lost some words.

49:29.980 --> 49:34.980
Luckily not bicycle or accident, because can you imagine?

49:34.980 --> 49:36.980
How would I even describe my situation?

49:36.980 --> 49:40.980
I was in a two-wheeled mobile accident.

49:40.980 --> 49:43.980
You know pedal pedals?

49:43.980 --> 49:47.980
I did a bad on one of them.

49:47.980 --> 49:51.980
On a pedal pedal I did a bad and boom, ouchie.

49:51.980 --> 49:54.980
I'm Bob Downey the second.

49:54.980 --> 49:56.980
I have a head contusion.

49:56.980 --> 49:58.980
Bob Downey the second, I'm glad you're here.

49:58.980 --> 50:00.980
You're better than Robert Downey Jr.

50:00.980 --> 50:04.980
You've explained this to me 18 times, Bob Downey the second.

50:04.980 --> 50:10.980
Sorry, I had this bicycle, uh-oh.

50:10.980 --> 50:14.980
I think there's a sliding scale for how good you have to be

50:14.980 --> 50:17.980
and how bad Robert Downey Jr. has to be.

50:17.980 --> 50:19.980
Because it's like you can be as good as you want,

50:19.980 --> 50:23.980
but unless Robert Downey Jr. has failed Santa in some way,

50:23.980 --> 50:27.980
I don't think he can close on that deal.

50:27.980 --> 50:31.980
I don't know, I didn't like Iron Man 2 very much.

50:31.980 --> 50:34.980
So now he has to be someone's servant?

50:34.980 --> 50:36.980
Yeah, I guess so.

50:36.980 --> 50:39.980
That's a pretty high standard now that I think about it.

50:39.980 --> 50:41.980
I don't want to be held to that standard.

50:41.980 --> 50:43.980
We all have off days.

50:43.980 --> 50:45.980
Questions from the audience?

50:45.980 --> 50:47.980
Yeah, let's do it.

50:47.980 --> 50:50.980
Let's start on this side.

50:50.980 --> 50:52.980
You want it too much.

50:52.980 --> 50:54.980
You weren't the first hand up.

50:54.980 --> 50:58.980
Yes, with the finger pointing at themself, yes.

50:58.980 --> 51:01.980
Hi, hello, hey, hey.

51:01.980 --> 51:03.980
Not you, Michael Sullivan,

51:03.980 --> 51:06.980
stage manager for our live extravaganza.

51:06.980 --> 51:08.980
We'll do you later.

51:08.980 --> 51:10.980
Hello, sir, what is your name?

51:10.980 --> 51:12.980
My name's Jordan.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.980
Do you understand the rule?

51:14.980 --> 51:16.980
No bummers.

51:16.980 --> 51:18.980
How can we help?

51:18.980 --> 51:20.980
I travel a lot for work,

51:20.980 --> 51:22.980
and I have to be in a place for a long period of time

51:22.980 --> 51:24.980
on a project.

51:24.980 --> 51:26.980
Can you speak just right up in here?

51:26.980 --> 51:28.980
Like an old timey radio show.

51:28.980 --> 51:30.980
Pretend you're doing an ad for Ajax.

51:30.980 --> 51:32.980
You can just lean down.

51:32.980 --> 51:34.980
You don't have to do a weird squatty thing.

51:34.980 --> 51:36.980
You bend at the waist, right?

51:36.980 --> 51:38.980
I don't want to assume.

51:38.980 --> 51:40.980
Can you stop kibitzing for a second?

51:40.980 --> 51:42.980
Sure can.

51:42.980 --> 51:44.980
I have to travel for work and be in a place

51:44.980 --> 51:46.980
for a long period of time.

51:46.980 --> 51:48.980
I'm living in a corporate apartment in New York City.

51:48.980 --> 51:51.980
I'm single, and I can't really decorate.

51:51.980 --> 51:54.980
I'll buy the rights to your TV show right now.

51:54.980 --> 51:56.980
How ready are you to mingle?

51:56.980 --> 51:58.980
How zany is your neighbor?

51:58.980 --> 52:00.980
The mingling is like mid-level ready to mingle.

52:00.980 --> 52:02.980
I am single and somewhat ready to mingle.

52:02.980 --> 52:04.980
So as I am ready,

52:04.980 --> 52:06.980
like I need to...

52:06.980 --> 52:08.980
Right now it's like filled with like Pier 1 imports,

52:08.980 --> 52:10.980
like gross furniture and stuff,

52:10.980 --> 52:12.980
because I didn't furnish it.

52:12.980 --> 52:14.980
So, but I also can't put anything permanent in

52:14.980 --> 52:16.980
because I'm leaving in March.

52:16.980 --> 52:18.980
So how do I put together an apartment that feels like me

52:18.980 --> 52:20.980
without spending any money

52:20.980 --> 52:24.980
and also...

52:24.980 --> 52:26.980
So let me understand.

52:26.980 --> 52:28.980
You can't spend any money on nothing permanent,

52:28.980 --> 52:30.980
but it has to really scream Jordan.

52:30.980 --> 52:32.980
Yes.

52:32.980 --> 52:34.980
That's exactly it.

52:34.980 --> 52:36.980
Can you write over the wall,

52:36.980 --> 52:38.980
to the door,

52:38.980 --> 52:40.980
on the outside of the door,

52:40.980 --> 52:42.980
Jordan's place.

52:42.980 --> 52:44.980
Well, I did that, so that's done.

52:44.980 --> 52:46.980
Done.

52:46.980 --> 52:48.980
Darn.

52:48.980 --> 52:50.980
Ooh, that was close.

52:50.980 --> 52:52.980
Can you...

52:52.980 --> 52:54.980
Can you turn on the furniture upside down,

52:54.980 --> 52:56.980
just like Jordan lives here,

52:56.980 --> 52:58.980
he's a real free spirit.

52:58.980 --> 53:00.980
You know Jordan.

53:00.980 --> 53:02.980
He's a real free spirit.

53:02.980 --> 53:04.980
He doesn't like to sit on things.

53:04.980 --> 53:06.980
He doesn't like to sit on things.

53:06.980 --> 53:08.980
You know those noonie and noonie from that funny SNL skit?

53:08.980 --> 53:10.980
He's like those people.

53:10.980 --> 53:12.980
Cool.

53:12.980 --> 53:14.980
Yeah, Jordan,

53:14.980 --> 53:16.980
you're kind of tying our hands,

53:16.980 --> 53:18.980
because normally I just say,

53:18.980 --> 53:20.980
go out and just buy the most expensive rug.

53:20.980 --> 53:22.980
Right.

53:22.980 --> 53:24.980
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

53:24.980 --> 53:26.980
Stop, everybody, stop.

53:26.980 --> 53:28.980
Wait, wait, wait, shut up, shut up.

53:28.980 --> 53:30.980
Unless...

53:30.980 --> 53:32.980
Okay, now there will be some investment in this,

53:32.980 --> 53:34.980
but you need to get a storage unit,

53:34.980 --> 53:36.980
move all the furniture into that unit,

53:36.980 --> 53:38.980
and then get nothing else in your unit.

53:38.980 --> 53:40.980
And then when people come in,

53:40.980 --> 53:42.980
you look at them in the eye,

53:42.980 --> 53:44.980
and you say, think about me,

53:44.980 --> 53:46.980
picture the furniture.

53:46.980 --> 53:48.980
Oh, my God.

53:48.980 --> 53:50.980
He is the pan.

53:50.980 --> 53:52.980
Yeah, and then, yeah, bang-a-rang.

53:52.980 --> 53:54.980
Oh, there you are, Jordan.

53:54.980 --> 53:56.980
Oh, there you are, Jordan.

53:56.980 --> 53:58.980
Knowing what you know about me,

53:58.980 --> 54:00.980
inflatable furniture.

54:00.980 --> 54:02.980
You're doing it, and then the furniture will appear.

54:02.980 --> 54:04.980
Yeah, bang-a-rang, you did it.

54:04.980 --> 54:06.980
It's a futon made of dogs.

54:06.980 --> 54:08.980
What?

54:08.980 --> 54:10.980
I'm going to have a seat on it.

54:10.980 --> 54:12.980
Oh, God, I broke my tailbone.

54:12.980 --> 54:14.980
That's so Jordan.

54:14.980 --> 54:16.980
I feel so unsafe in Jordan's place.

54:16.980 --> 54:18.980
Jordan's always breaking tailbones.

54:18.980 --> 54:20.980
Okay, can you make them

54:20.980 --> 54:22.980
draw a picture and then decorate

54:22.980 --> 54:24.980
the apartment with the pictures that they drew?

54:24.980 --> 54:26.980
Like, this is what others have seen.

54:26.980 --> 54:28.980
What will you see?

54:28.980 --> 54:30.980
I'll be back in three hours.

54:30.980 --> 54:32.980
I hope we didn't have anything pressing to do.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.980
Did we help you, Jordan?

54:36.980 --> 54:38.980
That was so good. Thank you so much.

54:38.980 --> 54:40.980
Thank you, Jordan.

54:40.980 --> 54:42.980
I picked the last one.

54:42.980 --> 54:44.980
Travis, you pick the middle.

54:44.980 --> 54:46.980
Yes, you should.

54:46.980 --> 54:48.980
Yes, mustache.

54:48.980 --> 54:50.980
That was fun.

54:50.980 --> 54:52.980
That's a jaunty hello.

54:52.980 --> 54:54.980
Well, hello.

54:54.980 --> 54:56.980
Oh, boy.

54:56.980 --> 54:58.980
I see what we're doing here.

54:58.980 --> 55:00.980
What is your name?

55:00.980 --> 55:02.980
My name is Bobby.

55:02.980 --> 55:04.980
Bobby, do you understand the rule?

55:04.980 --> 55:06.980
No, gosh-darn-bummers.

55:06.980 --> 55:08.980
There you go, good.

55:08.980 --> 55:10.980
I travel in town for the holidays

55:10.980 --> 55:12.980
every year, and over the past couple of years

55:12.980 --> 55:14.980
my family's been moving Christmas

55:14.980 --> 55:16.980
back

55:16.980 --> 55:18.980
gradually. Now, because I'm traveling

55:18.980 --> 55:20.980
in, I can't necessarily get

55:20.980 --> 55:22.980
off work for the 18th.

55:22.980 --> 55:24.980
Oh, whoa.

55:24.980 --> 55:26.980
How do I stop Christmas from sliding into September?

55:26.980 --> 55:28.980
Okay.

55:28.980 --> 55:30.980
I must stop Christmas from coming for now.

55:32.980 --> 55:34.980
Have you already experienced

55:34.980 --> 55:36.980
Christmas, Bobby?

55:36.980 --> 55:38.980
It's been a little while.

55:38.980 --> 55:40.980
Okay. Like this year, 2015,

55:40.980 --> 55:42.980
has your Christmas come and gone yet?

55:42.980 --> 55:44.980
Oh, I missed it.

55:44.980 --> 55:46.980
Oh, you missed it. Cool.

55:46.980 --> 55:48.980
Oh, wait, hold on.

55:48.980 --> 55:50.980
I've got this. Do you know what's great here, Bobby?

55:50.980 --> 55:52.980
Whenever you roll up is Christmas.

55:52.980 --> 55:54.980
Yeah.

55:54.980 --> 55:56.980
You didn't miss Christmas. They did

55:56.980 --> 55:58.980
Christmas early.

55:58.980 --> 56:00.980
That's what we learned from the Grinch who stole Christmas, actually.

56:00.980 --> 56:02.980
If it's not the exchanging of gifts,

56:02.980 --> 56:04.980
it's the people around you.

56:04.980 --> 56:06.980
I would legitimately say, like,

56:06.980 --> 56:08.980
I don't think you did have Christmas

56:08.980 --> 56:10.980
because Bobby wasn't here.

56:10.980 --> 56:12.980
Check the pictures.

56:12.980 --> 56:14.980
Do you see Bobby?

56:14.980 --> 56:16.980
Let's go to the videotape.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.980
Yeah, I'm seeing no Bobby here.

56:18.980 --> 56:20.980
Yeah, no Bobby. I don't think

56:20.980 --> 56:22.980
you had Christmas because it's about the people.

56:22.980 --> 56:24.980
I've only known you for 110 seconds,

56:24.980 --> 56:26.980
but I just know you are

56:26.980 --> 56:28.980
Christmas.

56:28.980 --> 56:30.980
I'm not convinced you're not a bunch

56:30.980 --> 56:32.980
of presents stacked up in jeans

56:32.980 --> 56:34.980
and a shirt.

56:34.980 --> 56:36.980
Well, you don't have to...

56:36.980 --> 56:38.980
I'm not looking at your naked

56:38.980 --> 56:40.980
boxes.

56:40.980 --> 56:42.980
Well, now I am.

56:42.980 --> 56:44.980
He was unwrapping me with his eyes.

56:44.980 --> 56:46.980
Can you imagine

56:46.980 --> 56:48.980
anything more... I think you do a protest

56:48.980 --> 56:50.980
Christmas on December the 25th.

56:50.980 --> 56:52.980
Can you imagine anything more rad than

56:52.980 --> 56:54.980
Bobby sitting on the floor,

56:54.980 --> 56:56.980
little Santa hat, pile of presents in front of

56:56.980 --> 56:58.980
the tree by himself, just like,

56:58.980 --> 57:00.980
Well, this one's the sandwich maker.

57:00.980 --> 57:02.980
Thank you to whoever

57:02.980 --> 57:04.980
got this for me.

57:04.980 --> 57:06.980
If anyone would like to join me, I'll be in the living room

57:06.980 --> 57:08.980
while his family's in the kitchen.

57:08.980 --> 57:10.980
I don't know where we went wrong.

57:10.980 --> 57:12.980
It's New Year's Eve already.

57:12.980 --> 57:14.980
Over here, we're a week

57:14.980 --> 57:16.980
ahead.

57:16.980 --> 57:18.980
Oh, wait till they lap you, and then it's

57:18.980 --> 57:20.980
Christmas again.

57:20.980 --> 57:22.980
The

57:22.980 --> 57:24.980
stupid thing is they should be pushing it later

57:24.980 --> 57:26.980
because they can get all the decorations that

57:26.980 --> 57:28.980
like 50% off.

57:28.980 --> 57:30.980
Hence our entire like

57:30.980 --> 57:32.980
scene right now.

57:32.980 --> 57:34.980
Bobby, does that help?

57:34.980 --> 57:36.980
Very much so.

57:36.980 --> 57:38.980
Justin, pick somebody from the right.

57:38.980 --> 57:40.980
My turn. If you're a

57:40.980 --> 57:42.980
non-dude,

57:42.980 --> 57:44.980
can you raise your hand?

57:44.980 --> 57:46.980
I want to get a non-dude. There you go.

57:46.980 --> 57:48.980
Right here. Come on up.

57:48.980 --> 57:50.980
The mic is so far away.

57:50.980 --> 57:52.980
This Christmas...

57:52.980 --> 57:54.980
Alright, let's give him a big round of applause.

57:54.980 --> 57:58.980
Hello,

57:58.980 --> 58:00.980
and what is your name? Hello, my name's

58:00.980 --> 58:02.980
Nathania. Hi, Nathania.

58:02.980 --> 58:04.980
Is that with an N? Nathania? Yes, it is.

58:04.980 --> 58:06.980
Okay, welcome. And do you know the

58:06.980 --> 58:08.980
rule? Yes, I do. No bummers.

58:08.980 --> 58:10.980
Okay. Okay. How can we help?

58:10.980 --> 58:12.980
So, my husband, he's the best.

58:12.980 --> 58:14.980
Okay. Alright!

58:14.980 --> 58:16.980
Sounds like you don't need any help.

58:16.980 --> 58:18.980
Yeah, sounds like you're fine. I don't.

58:18.980 --> 58:20.980
He's awesome. I've been

58:20.980 --> 58:22.980
waiting for the results of that contest

58:22.980 --> 58:24.980
all day.

58:24.980 --> 58:26.980
And to find out like this, Nathania?

58:26.980 --> 58:28.980
Yeah, I know.

58:28.980 --> 58:30.980
This how you do me?

58:30.980 --> 58:32.980
Steve Harvey should

58:32.980 --> 58:34.980
come out and announce the results, right guys?

58:34.980 --> 58:36.980
Tabagal!

58:36.980 --> 58:38.980
And the best husband is

58:38.980 --> 58:40.980
Griffin McElroy. No, wait a minute.

58:40.980 --> 58:42.980
I'm like on

58:42.980 --> 58:44.980
news alerts, like, what just happened?

58:44.980 --> 58:46.980
So I can reference that. Freshest ref.

58:46.980 --> 58:48.980
Freshest ref award goes to

58:48.980 --> 58:50.980
Griffin. No, wait, it went to Travis.

58:50.980 --> 58:52.980
Steve Harvey, not again!

58:54.980 --> 58:56.980
Nathania, how can we

58:56.980 --> 58:58.980
help?

58:58.980 --> 59:00.980
So, he

59:00.980 --> 59:02.980
knows what he likes.

59:02.980 --> 59:04.980
And it's hard to get

59:04.980 --> 59:06.980
him gifts. Sure.

59:06.980 --> 59:08.980
So I don't want any advice

59:08.980 --> 59:10.980
on what gifts to give him. Good.

59:10.980 --> 59:12.980
I want to know, how

59:12.980 --> 59:14.980
can we, myself

59:14.980 --> 59:16.980
and his family, make him

59:16.980 --> 59:18.980
like whatever gifts we give him?

59:18.980 --> 59:20.980
Nathania,

59:20.980 --> 59:22.980
is your husband here right now?

59:22.980 --> 59:24.980
He is. He brought me here.

59:24.980 --> 59:26.980
This is my Christmas present.

59:26.980 --> 59:28.980
Oh, man, he won. Nice.

59:28.980 --> 59:30.980
That's hard to beat. He's the best.

59:30.980 --> 59:32.980
Mr. Nathania?

59:32.980 --> 59:34.980
Can I give you...

59:34.980 --> 59:36.980
Did you raise your hand? Yes.

59:36.980 --> 59:38.980
Sorry, what? No, we're singing with

59:38.980 --> 59:40.980
Mr. Nathania. Yeah, it's not that important.

59:40.980 --> 59:42.980
You're not at the microphone.

59:42.980 --> 59:44.980
I'm gonna

59:44.980 --> 59:46.980
tell you a lesson that I learned

59:46.980 --> 59:48.980
when I was about eight years old.

59:48.980 --> 59:50.980
And that is that gifts

59:50.980 --> 59:52.980
given to you are

59:52.980 --> 59:54.980
not for you.

59:54.980 --> 59:56.980
They are for the person who gave them

59:56.980 --> 59:58.980
to you so that you can be thankful

59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.980
for all the love that they showed you

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.980
in that gift. And if you look up from the gift

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.980
and go, you're

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.980
the worst.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.980
I learned that

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.980
at eight. I doubt very much he does that.

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.980
But there is

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.980
some nuance to the situation that Travis does not.

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.980
That is impossible.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.980
But this is the lie in what you

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.980
just said is that if you

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.980
really love somebody and you cannot

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.980
tell instantly

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.980
that they don't like something,

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.980
right away, everybody...

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.980
Oh, it's a lie we tell each other.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.980
It's a lie we tell each other like, oh, you hated that

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.980
and I know you hated that, but that's not what this

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.980
is about. I get it. Yeah, you have to

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.980
go to your grave like, no, absolutely not.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.980
I loved it, and it was the best coffee maker

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.980
I ever got in my entire life. I never used it.

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.980
It was great.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.980
Get a present-receiving

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.980
catchphrase.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.980
What? No, listen.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.980
It's something I've been

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.980
doing for years, and you guys probably haven't noticed.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.980
I'm kind of part of the kimono right now, but...

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.980
Don't look!

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.980
Get a

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.980
present-receiving catchphrase.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.980
So every time you get a present, no matter what it is,

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.980
it doesn't matter. This is a

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.980
gift-agnostic

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.980
idiom, and don't steal mine because

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.980
I need it, but just be like,

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.980
oh, tight!

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.980
That makes so much sense

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.980
now.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.980
But everybody has one

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.980
of those, right?

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.980
Mine is like,

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.980
I'll open it.

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.980
That's a whole

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.980
run!

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.980
I do it every

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.980
gift. Mine is just this.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.980
Ooh, Travis like!

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.980
We all really don't like Travis.

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:44.980
Christmas is a real horror show.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.980
We don't use Travis

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.980
gifts anymore. Not even

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.980
invited. Nathaniel,

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.980
can you tape a 20 to

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.980
it somewhere?

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.980
Just tape a 20.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.980
Who doesn't like that? Yeah. Just hand

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.980
him a 20. Just hand him a 20. Tape to

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.980
like, whatever thing. And ask for five dollars

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.980
back. Or a fake

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.980
price tag on

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.980
it. That's a big

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:10.980
high price.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.980
Like one million dollars.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.980
Wait, Griffin, I'm worried that this side

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.980
of the audience didn't see it. Could you do that one more time?

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.980
Like a high price. Like one million dollars.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.980
You can purchase the GIF outside

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.980
after the show. Don't worry, folks.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.980
Yeah, we got DVDs.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.980
Nathaniel, does that help? Absolutely.

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.980
Great. Thank you.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.980
She's good at lying if she didn't like

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.980
what she got.

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.980
Let's go

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.980
for one more from the back.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.980
From the way back. Flashy Hanukkah shirt.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.980
Flashy Hanukkah shirt, yes. You earned it.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.980
And I don't mean like

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.980
ostentatious Hanukkah shirt.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.980
No, it's literally, it is

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.980
illuminated. Hello.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.980
Hello.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.980
Did somebody just boo me?

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.980
No. They said hello in a very

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.980
Germanic manner. They said hello the opposite

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.980
of booing you. They did a hello from downtown.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.980
Hello. What is your name?

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.980
My name is Shaylin. Hi, Shaylin.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.980
Hey, Shaylin. Hi. Can you scoot over to the

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.980
just close the door? Perfect. There we go.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.980
Let her rip. Okay. Hi.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.980
Go for it. I was wondering

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.980
if I was to decorate my home

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:20.980
for Candle Nights next year,

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.980
what color scheme

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.980
would you say is the official

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.980
color scheme of Candle Nights?

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.980
Whew.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.980
No, this is a good question.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.980
No, this is a good question.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:34.980
And it's honestly,

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.980
it's honestly as

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.980
one of the three dads

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.980
of Candle Nights.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.980
It's one of the reasons

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.980
why the holiday

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.980
hasn't caught on as much as

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.980
we would want it to.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.980
Because the problem is

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.980
the color of Candle Nights

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.980
is fire.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.980
And you hear,

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.980
you just heard me say that and your brain

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.980
thought like, oh, red. No, you

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.980
misunderstand.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.980
It's

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.980
fire.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.980
To do a house up

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.980
like that is...

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.980
Arson.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.980
I mean, it's arson.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.980
Everything you see in front of you is

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.980
rigged to explode when the show's over.

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.980
It's going to be quite

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.980
the... Don't stick around.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.980
Don't stick around. Get out.

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:28.980
I think that what we just did

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.980
was illegal.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:32.980
No, there's nothing flammable.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.980
Just claiming fire in a big stuff building.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.980
But fine. No, that was a joke. Clearly

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.980
it's parody fair use. Listen.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.980
That's how fair use works.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.980
It's tricky because inside

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.980
you get some candles, whatever.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.980
Outside, what do you do?

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.980
Outside of a controlled burn?

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.980
Outside of like

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.980
sick like butane

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.980
fountains? Is that even a thing?

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.980
You could also, I was going to say

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.980
like project fire onto your house

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.980
but I feel like that might go poorly.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.980
They have a name for that, Travis.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.980
It's somebody whose house is

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.980
about to be gone.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.980
You can't project fire onto your house.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.980
Oh, you meant a picture. Okay, got it.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.980
Got it. Not literal fire.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.980
I'm with you now.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.980
But still, the point

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.980
stands, if somebody has a fire hologram

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.980
on their house, your neighbor's not going to

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.980
drive by and be like, oh, sick.

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.980
I will say, they won't this year

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.980
but maybe soon. They'll be like, oh,

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.980
candle lights. Nice.

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.980
That's all the holidays together.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.980
A controlled burn on the front facade

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.980
of your house. Get an

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.980
expert. Oh, get an expert to get this

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.980
controlled burn going. But just have

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.980
it spell out, it's cool.

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.980
This is cool.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.980
This is cool is fine. Don't call the police,

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.980
Dave.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.980
Again.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.980
Unless this, if this doesn't,

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.980
if this stops spelling out

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.980
this is cool.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.980
Call the police or the fire

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.980
people. Unless this is also on fire,

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.980
Dave.

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.980
Then please tell me, Dave.

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.980
I'm so scared.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.980
His house says it's all

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.980
Oh, no, no, no.

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.980
That's not a word.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.980
Stop being words. Get them.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.980
Get the fire.

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.980
Is this a call about the house that's part way

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.980
on fire? Yeah, we've heard about it. No, you don't understand.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.980
No, no, no. The worm has turned.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.980
It got worse.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.980
Does that

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.980
help? That helps a lot.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.980
Cool. Don't do any of that stuff.

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.980
Thank you.

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.980
Yeah, I think that's

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.980
going to do it. Okay, listen.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.980
All kidding aside,

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.980
the fact that so many of you

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.980
folks who raise your hand if you're not

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.980
from West Virginia at all.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.980
Oh, my God. No.

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.980
Anybody not from America?

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.980
Curiosity. All right.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.980
All right. All right. Cool, cool, cool.

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.980
Thank you so much for coming

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.980
to Candle Nights. Did you have a good time?

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.980
We

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.980
sort of like

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.980
tweet nice stuff to that effect.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.980
Tweet hashtag Candle Nights.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.980
Hashtag Candle Nights like I had a great time so we can keep doing it.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.980
Not that like

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.980
the man is going to keep us from doing it.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.980
It's pretty much just us and Chase.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.980
And you can't shut us down, Obama.

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.980
Thank you. By the way, thank you.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.980
Huge, huge, huge thank you.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.980
There's so many people I have to thank, but

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.980
Chase Henderson put on this show.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.980
He's the promoter of our show, Chase Henderson.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.980
All of Chase's volunteers

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.980
who helped out. Thank you so, so much.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.980
Thank you to Michael Sullivan,

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.980
who was our stage manager. He did a great job.

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.980
Thank you to

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.980
Dwight

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.980
Slappy. Am I saying that right? Dwight.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.980
Great.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.980
Dwight Slappy from Things I Bought Sheets.

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.980
Thank you to Sydney Smurl McElroy.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.980
Is it McElroy? McElroy?

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.980
McElroy from Sawbones.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.980
I would also like to say thank you to

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.980
Theresa McElroy. And to Rachel McElroy.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.980
Let me put you back on this.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.980
And Clem McElroy and Carol McElroy

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.980
who did all of the beautiful decorations

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.980
that you see on stage.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:10.980
Thank you to Jason

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.980
and Tyler Eldridge for being our

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.980
for being the Druids who stole Dwight away.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.980
Thank you to Boyd Smith for being the Grinch.

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.980
Okay, that's all. Oh wait, one more.

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.980
Thank you to Josh and the folks at Billions for helping us set up.

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.980
Yes, and all the Carolers.

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.980
And the Carolers who named Dad.

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.980
Dad!

01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:28.980
And thank you to Riley. Riley Smurl.

01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.980
Riley Smurl, thank you so much.

01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:32.980
I just want to like, I referenced this at the beginning

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.980
about how this was a swearing day.

01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.980
It got really thorny there

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.980
like right before we had to come here.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.980
My baby, about

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:42.980
literally exactly the time

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:44.980
we were supposed to leave, my baby threw up

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:46.980
and had a temperature of 101.

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.980
So it was like, whoa. She's fine now.

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.980
She's fine now.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.980
I got a video of her playing Ring Around the Rosie.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.980
Like, she's good. But it was like, it was pretty intense there.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.980
So, thank you to

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.980
we have another hand to Sydney

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.980
who didn't really want to come, but did anyway.

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.980
Because she loves you.

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.980
And Charlie, if you're listening

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:06.980
to this in the future,

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.980
we're cool.

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.980
You're fine. You made it.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.980
My point was it got really thorny

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.980
and I got so stressed out because we got here

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.980
and everything was running behind and I was like really worried

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.980
that it was going to be terrible.

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.980
But like all of our friends and family came together to help us

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:22.980
put this on. It was real inspirational.

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:24.980
It was a genuine Candle Nights miracle.

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.980
Thank you all so much.

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.980
And thank you to you, the people who

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.980
like, if you came and stood in line

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:32.980
I understood it was raining. I'm sorry about that.

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.980
And if you came a long way

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.980
to come see us, that's awesome.

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.980
We're going to be

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.980
over at a bar called

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:42.980
The Lantern for a little bit.

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.980
Big fans here.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.980
Some lantern heads in the house.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.980
It's a 4th and 8th, right?

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.980
4th Avenue and 8th Street. Is that right?

01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.980
Yes. Thank you, Sullivan.

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.980
So we'll be over there.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.980
It's a fun place.

01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.980
And is that going to do it for us too, though?

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.980
I think so. You want that final yahoo?

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.980
We're going to do a final yahoo.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.980
Yeah.

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:06.980
Yeah, final yahoo and then...

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.980
Then we've got a special Candle Nights carol.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.980
There's not a lot of Candle Nights carols.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.980
There is one.

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.980
And we're going to perform that for you.

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.980
But we do have a final yahoo for you.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.980
Calm down.

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.980
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski,

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.980
climbing that ladder, Zoe Kinski.

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.980
Sorry, something's going wrong.

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.980
Oh, no, this one was Chuck Yeager too.

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.980
Chuck Yeager asks again.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.980
Man, he's active on yahoo.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.980
Did you think Mrs. Doubtfire

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:34.980
was hot when you were a kid,

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.980
or was that just me?

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.980
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.980
my name has been Justin

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.980
Tyler McElroy.

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.980
And I'm going to be

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.980
Justin Tyler McElroy.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.980
My name has been and will always be

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.980
Travis Patrick McElroy.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.980
I'm Griffin Andrew McElroy.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.980
This is a Candle Nights song.

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.980
Strummin' my sixth string.

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.980
No.

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.980
You already goofed on it.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.980
The words are on the screen. Read them.

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.980
Okay.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.980
I followed him.

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.980
Wait, where are you starting?

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.980
Where are you picking up?

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.980
From the beginning of the song!

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.980
Okay, go ahead.

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.980
Go ahead.

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:28.980
I would have been fine.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.980
I would have figured it out.

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.980
I'm a frigging professional.

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.980
No, no, no!

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.980
He didn't finish it.

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.980
I didn't finish it.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:40.980
I didn't finish it.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.980
I didn't finish it.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.980
Let me know when you're ready.

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.980
Oh, my god!

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.980
Livin' on sponge cake.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.980
Watchin' the sun bake.

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.980
All of the tourists

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.980
covered with oil.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.980
If you were in the show,

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:08.980
come on up!

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.280
I'm in my sixth straight.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.460
Come on, Dad.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.300
Riley.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.460
I'm on my front porch swing.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:20.360
Smell of the shrimp, they're beginning to boil.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.060
There's Sidney and Dwight Slappy.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.460
Wasted away again in Margaritaville.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.420
A druid.

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:35.460
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.020
Salt, salt, yes, sir.

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:44.020
Some people claim that there's a wolf on the plain,

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:50.380
but I don't, it's nobody's fault.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.340
Let's do the chorus one more time.

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.940
We're gonna drop the guitar,

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.220
and I just wanna hear everybody.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.460
Let's share this moment together.

01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.300
You ready?

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.300
No, that's cool, I get it.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:05.300
Five, six, five, six, seven, eight.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:12.500
Wasted away again in Margaritaville.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.340
Let me hear you.

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:15.300
Come on, everybody, it's Candle Nights.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:20.300
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:23.740
Salt, salt, salt.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:24.940
It's a thing.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:29.940
Some people claim that there's a wolf on the plain,

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:37.300
but I don't, it's nobody's fault.

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.860
Wait, one more time, one more time.

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.700
Come on, one more time.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.700
Wasted away again in Margaritaville.

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.620
I wanna hear you out there, Bill.

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.260
I wanna hear everybody, come on.

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.660
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.340
We actually sound like a drunk Jimmy Poppins concert

01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.180
right now.

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:03.100
Some people claim that there's a woman

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:08.100
on the plain, but I don't, it's nobody's fault.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.860
Joyous Candle Nights, everybody, goodnight.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:28.860
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say you got water?
