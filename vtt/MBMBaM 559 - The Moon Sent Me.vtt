The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

05:03.840 --> 05:10.960
Trending toward fraud right now. I feel like we're because people definitely are donating so I've worried

05:10.960 --> 05:15.320
What we're kind of looking at fraud in the store window and saying, I don't know

05:15.320 --> 05:20.860

07:28.480 --> 07:32.480
I build upon other of my own, but do not topple down

07:32.480 --> 07:36.000
I sit still and do nothing, but I'm still useful. What am I?

07:37.560 --> 07:40.920
Minecraft oh my god Griffin's Minecraft blocks

07:40.920 --> 07:47.280
I said the right answer to a riddle me piss. That's fantastic

07:48.240 --> 07:50.880
Congratulations Griffin. That's huge. I don't even know ten years

07:50.880 --> 07:57.600
Yeah, ten years off my sentence in the riddle prison and we're getting closer closer every day to that sunshine outside

07:58.480 --> 08:01.160
No that one actually makes sense trap. I put the pieces together

08:02.000 --> 08:08.080
Yeah, sure this squid squares that you build on as Minecraft kids love it learn about it learn about it

08:08.080 --> 08:13.120
I've learned about roblox too. I think that's the sequel to Minecraft is it my my kids won't tell me

08:14.640 --> 08:20.280
It's a real it's a real tricks situation. Did you have another one Travis or is it just no just that one

08:20.280 --> 08:23.400
I didn't expect Griffin's brain to be so I don't know young

08:23.760 --> 08:25.920
Here's what's wild and people have pointed this out

08:25.920 --> 08:30.040
I am always quick to do a slam on Travis's bits

08:30.200 --> 08:36.880
Which is part of the dynamic and he loves it, but also I'm really good at them

08:36.880 --> 08:44.480
Yeah, I'm like wicked good at Travis's bits like I'm so totally picking up what he's putting down something is broken inside you

08:44.480 --> 08:49.360
Yeah, that's what you're rejecting when you reject house's bits right and it makes me think that Travis broke it

08:54.520 --> 08:56.440
Yeah, please oh

08:56.440 --> 08:57.720
We should mention by the way

08:57.720 --> 09:02.920
This is kind of a special recording because this is the first one and not to continue to eulogize it forever

09:02.920 --> 09:09.800
But this is the first one that we have recorded since the shutdown of yahoo answers on May 4th. Yes

09:10.600 --> 09:14.760
Yeah, working without a net at this point. I well the nets still there

09:14.760 --> 09:18.000
It's a ghost net because there are some archived ones

09:18.480 --> 09:24.000
That I'm gonna bring to the bring to the table today just because I haven't found a replacement for it yet

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
I I would like to do a little business news here. Okay as someone who follows businesses. Yeah, I

09:30.000 --> 09:35.880
I don't know if y'all saw this but this week it was announced. I remember the tail in the last week

09:35.880 --> 09:37.880
It was very within the last week

09:38.200 --> 09:40.600
It was announced that Verizon which had bought

09:41.320 --> 09:46.880
Yahoo and AOL remember this yeah, I called him oath and then changed that to Verizon Media Group

09:46.880 --> 09:48.880
I think cuz oath is stupid. Yeah

09:49.200 --> 09:55.360
Well, so is so is buying AOL and yahoo. Yeah, but they just add a massive loss. I mean

09:55.360 --> 10:00.080
Really poor leadership just sold yahoo and AOL

10:00.640 --> 10:05.360
to Apollo management, I think is the name of the company, but I

10:06.040 --> 10:08.040
cannot I

10:09.040 --> 10:11.160
Cannot accept the fact that these two are not related

10:11.520 --> 10:17.920
There is it is 100% correlation to me that this Apollo management group didn't have the fucking guts

10:18.400 --> 10:23.760
To own yahoo answer. They don't they wouldn't do it. There's not a price high enough, right?

10:23.760 --> 10:30.080
Yahoo could be like well, we do have this one other no close it down. Shut it down. We won't be owning that

10:30.080 --> 10:32.440
Thank you. What does yahoo have?

10:33.200 --> 10:39.760
Other than yahoo answers that is worth. I think it was five billies. Well, it's that fun yahoo

10:41.240 --> 10:44.000
Right it you pay for the rights to yahoo

10:45.440 --> 10:47.440
Brand it's also one of the most I mean

10:48.560 --> 10:50.560
Juice a juice you do one

10:50.560 --> 10:55.720
Yeah, hey, let's see you can do the highest one Travis your turn

11:05.320 --> 11:07.320
No, my dogs are going nuts

11:07.720 --> 11:12.840
So the show kicks ass Apollo shut it. I think Apollo wouldn't close the deal

11:12.840 --> 11:21.080
I think it was one of the parts of the deal is like we won't buy this. Yeah, you have to kill it. Yeah homepages

11:21.080 --> 11:26.160
This is like there's a bunch of boomers that set their home page to yahoo when internet first came out

11:26.160 --> 11:31.160
They thought oh this I won't need anything other than this right and it's still that's still the front page

11:31.200 --> 11:34.600
That's still where they're going. Yeah, so I don't know you tell me

11:35.640 --> 11:37.640
They got a lot of news stories up there

11:38.600 --> 11:41.240
It looks like the good doctor may be canceled. I don't know

11:41.240 --> 11:42.240
No

11:42.240 --> 11:47.400
Page for new new information. Um, okay. Okay, so help help help

11:47.400 --> 11:51.920
I recently became aware through a mutual friend that my roommate's girlfriend was planning to break up with

11:52.680 --> 11:57.240
That's slow down all these people knowing people and having relationships with people gets very confusing to me

11:57.240 --> 11:59.680
Yeah, that was a very followable sentence though

11:59.680 --> 12:05.880
Justin I recently became aware through a mutual friend that my roommate's girlfriend was planning to break up with him

12:05.880 --> 12:11.600
Okay, it is clear that my roommate has no idea. This is coming and we'll take it hard

12:11.600 --> 12:15.320
I am NOT the best at helping someone pick up the pieces after one of these things

12:15.320 --> 12:18.840
But I wanted to offer some support. So I decided to purchase

12:19.720 --> 12:25.520
Uh-huh. I mean there's a there's a price tag price just like right in the middle here purchase

12:26.920 --> 12:28.520
$199

12:28.520 --> 12:35.000
$19.99 for a roommate who's a lifelong Texas Longhorns fan a cameo pep talk from UT football legend Colt McCoy

12:35.000 --> 12:39.920
My question is how long must I wait after the breakup to share? Mr

12:39.920 --> 12:44.880
McCoy's rousing speech to avoid suspicion that I knew about the breakup ahead of time

12:44.880 --> 12:48.800
I don't want to wait too long and I've not had the desired effect

12:48.800 --> 12:53.760
But also don't want to move too quick and out myself as an accessory to this breakup plan

12:53.760 --> 12:56.680
It's from cameo countdown in the Pacific North

12:56.800 --> 13:03.400
Let's let's take our time with this one because I'm jittery because it's the best question

13:03.400 --> 13:08.340
We've gotten I think in years. It is so to

13:09.640 --> 13:15.200
Explore a new wrinkle in the sort of this human web of

13:16.000 --> 13:20.960
Flesh and love that we have between us. I thought we'd seen it all this is a new one

13:20.960 --> 13:27.380
What do you do with your precog breakup Colt McCoy cameo because it can't be like, oh, yeah Doug

13:27.380 --> 13:34.100
My my partner broke up with me. Ah, that's a bummer, but I know it's gonna help. Yeah, you can't know

13:34.100 --> 13:37.900
It's like this is true. You can't have it ready to go for sure

13:38.220 --> 13:44.620
but you also like it was smart of you to not wait because what if you had

13:45.220 --> 13:48.980
Like sent the request to call McCoy after that, you know, the word came down

13:50.180 --> 13:55.120
Home office, you know, right sure what if and it had taken a lot sometimes on cameo, you know

13:55.120 --> 14:00.180
I've got a couple cameos and sometimes it takes a long time. Sometimes Jojo see what just declines the

14:03.260 --> 14:07.780
Nothing against Jojo, I know she's extremely busy more like no no see why

14:08.460 --> 14:11.460
Yeah, it's mom now. Well cuz I said no no

14:12.020 --> 14:15.060
I mean Jojo's got a lot of different business opportunities

14:15.060 --> 14:19.060
She's a leader and I'm just saying that like you can't be counting on it

14:19.060 --> 14:21.060
You can't be like well Mother's Day is taken care of

14:21.060 --> 14:27.100
Jojo Siwa is gonna I mean that wasn't what it sure you get the idea. You also need to be very careful that mr

14:27.100 --> 14:32.620
McCoy the football legend doesn't say anything during the message that will give it away

14:32.620 --> 14:35.580
Oh instance if he's like, I'm I heard you're having a rough time

14:35.580 --> 14:41.020
I just want you know, hang in there go longhorns hook em horns and happy Easter, right?

14:42.460 --> 14:44.460
Today's newspaper

14:45.860 --> 14:47.860
Exactly also

14:48.100 --> 14:50.100
When you go to cameo

14:50.100 --> 14:57.200
And you're looking at I'll say it an artist and and and wondering whether or not you're gonna make a purchase from them

14:57.420 --> 15:00.840
One of the things that's on their page is a bunch of other

15:01.100 --> 15:07.060
Cameos that they've done for people and I want you question asker and everybody listening at home to sort of

15:07.460 --> 15:09.460
Process the fact that there is a non

15:10.060 --> 15:11.740
zero chance

15:11.740 --> 15:14.620
That this video is just sitting on old boy

15:14.620 --> 15:20.780
A home page right now Wowzers that this could just be on there

15:21.180 --> 15:27.860
Especially if your roommate is a Colt McCoy fan and wow. Yeah. Oh, I wonder if McCoy has a cameo pit

15:29.300 --> 15:35.780
Worst worst case scenario is that they're a Colt McCoy fan and my brother my brother and me fan

15:35.780 --> 15:40.980
Oh, no, because now they we left you all the clues you needed detective

15:40.980 --> 15:46.140
Hey, you put it together question asker. You need to get a hold your roommate's girlfriend and get her to do it, right?

15:47.940 --> 15:50.620
This is what you have to Travis has a great point

15:50.620 --> 15:57.100
I'm sorry, but you have to encourage the girlfriend to just pull the trigger. Hey Susan. I fucked up

15:58.540 --> 16:04.620
Hey, listen, you you got to pull put a bullet right between his eyes, but just give him that old Anton Chigurh in

16:04.620 --> 16:12.180
a bolt right there and put him down done a done fun you could also fucked up and Colt fucked up to

16:14.380 --> 16:19.980
Let me loop cold in here. Hey cope you're you're on with Susan. Yeah. Hey, it's me football legend Colt McCoy

16:20.060 --> 16:25.220
You got to do this. You got a view. You got a break up with this dude. Got it in it

16:25.220 --> 16:27.220
Can you get a cameo begging?

16:27.740 --> 16:31.880
Colt McCoy begging the girlfriend to dump. Well, you need to get now

16:31.880 --> 16:35.960
You're gonna need to get a cameo of someone Colt McCoy respects to tell Colt McCoy to do it

16:36.620 --> 16:42.780
Damn, I'm hoping that there's not a lot of Colt McCoy slash my brother my brother and me fans out there who now think that their

16:42.780 --> 16:49.900
Girlfriend is about to dump them. And now they're calling their girlfriends. Like I heard the good word from the McElroy's we're done Samantha

16:50.580 --> 16:55.380
It's over. Hey, and also I got a comma Colt McCoy and tell him to fuck off to

16:56.940 --> 16:58.940
Hey, do you guys want?

16:58.940 --> 17:03.340
a ghost a ghost of a yahoo a ghost of yahoo's past

17:03.540 --> 17:07.060
This feels a little bit like in stand by me where they're gonna go poke a dead body

17:07.220 --> 17:11.380
well, I had to I had to come back to it because we did get an email from the

17:12.600 --> 17:19.600
Druid himself the level 9000. Yeah, Drew Druid drew Davenport. And this is yahoo answers user Josh

17:20.140 --> 17:21.820
who asks

17:21.820 --> 17:25.380
Baby cast a spell at slash on me

17:25.380 --> 17:30.900
Mm-hmm. My cousin's new baby pointed at me and said something that sounded like a spell

17:30.900 --> 17:37.800
I know babies have a stronger connection to the magical source and I don't remember the exact incantation. Am I gonna be okay?

17:38.140 --> 17:41.980
Well, it's a pill. Why would you assume it's a negative spell?

17:43.340 --> 17:45.580
Could be a positive baby blessing. Oh

17:45.580 --> 17:53.900
Oh that do they do those do babies are babies concerned enough with other living beings

17:54.180 --> 18:01.060
That they would would bless them or are they really really really just kind of about their own?

18:01.260 --> 18:07.220
Shit in a very rude way. It depends on if you get yourself an angelic or a Tommy Pickles, right?

18:07.220 --> 18:15.220
Oh, you got a tiny tiny pickles out there doing good. Let's just say I got myself a reptile. Oh, oh, man

18:16.620 --> 18:19.020
Babies don't talk words

18:20.020 --> 18:25.420
Typically, unless we use it and there's some people who use the word baby liberally

18:25.420 --> 18:28.660
I think you stop being baby at like

18:29.340 --> 18:31.340
to

18:31.340 --> 18:38.940
I believe when the baby can't toddle around Griffin there is now a new term for them. You usually refer babies

18:39.060 --> 18:40.620
toddle babies

18:40.620 --> 18:43.780
Tidal babies toddle be yeah, could it be one of them toddle bees?

18:44.860 --> 18:48.340
What kind of magic would a baby even be interested?

18:48.900 --> 18:55.820
In doing because it's not as fun as it seems like in movies and TV where it's like, you know

18:56.340 --> 18:58.340
Hamburgers falling from the sky

18:58.340 --> 19:05.060
Magic isn't as fun. Yeah. No. Yeah, it's you know, it's a bit more tame than you know

19:05.060 --> 19:11.620
Make make my pacifier bigger or whatever. Mm-hmm. I think I mean, let's see

19:11.620 --> 19:17.140
What do babies care about babies care about pacifier? Yeah babies care about

19:18.540 --> 19:20.540
Pulling naked on my beard what?

19:21.060 --> 19:25.500
Babies care about naked. They do care about naked. Love that. Love that. I love the naked

19:25.500 --> 19:32.860
Maybe that's it. Maybe the baby is just saying like I'm gonna cast a spell on you. That makes you do stuff for me

19:33.540 --> 19:38.500
Right because that's like what babies are about maybe doesn't have to do that. That's what babies

19:38.620 --> 19:40.660
That's what baby is baby

19:40.660 --> 19:44.060
all baby is is a box you put food in and

19:44.380 --> 19:49.420
You lay them down when they need it and if you do either of those two things bad

19:49.420 --> 19:54.000
They make a sound that sucks shit so that you will fix it

19:54.000 --> 20:00.160
It's all that they are. I love my new one. So dope. It's great. I've created life

20:01.760 --> 20:07.040
But he pissed on me twice yesterday a lot of people have baby

20:07.360 --> 20:09.360
Yeah, because they want to have child

20:09.880 --> 20:14.620
But baby is a bridge. Yep, and it's a Ricky one. Oh boy

20:15.520 --> 20:20.120
Oh you did fall now you're burning in the lava. Yes, the bridge was over lava

20:20.120 --> 20:25.380
Do you still want child this decision that no longer affects you you have baby

20:25.380 --> 20:27.100
Yeah, this is all you've ever had

20:27.100 --> 20:32.740
This is all you will ever have and here's the best thing too is to follow up Justin's analogy

20:32.860 --> 20:34.460
Sometimes you don't fall off the bridge

20:34.460 --> 20:39.980
But the bridge has decided you fell off the bridge and it's still mad the bridge is still mad at you

20:39.980 --> 20:46.900
I I don't think there's anything people want to hear less than adults complaining about their babies

20:46.900 --> 20:51.860
So there I will say this what you should have done and you got to be on your toes

20:52.580 --> 20:56.100
user of this now defunct and disgraced website

20:56.940 --> 21:03.960
You gotta do a counter curse right then and there like don't skip a beat like, you know, pull out your

21:05.420 --> 21:11.520
Salts or whatever and do a little do a little counter charm and and when everybody asks what you're doing

21:11.520 --> 21:15.620
You can say like oh, it's a it's a trick for babies. I learned about it. It's a baby gun

21:15.620 --> 21:21.740
It's a baby trick. This is a rattle because it looks like sage. No, it's a rattle. No, I learned it from David Blaine

21:21.740 --> 21:27.300
It's a baby. That's actually the proper procedure is you like the sage hand the sage to the baby

21:27.340 --> 21:34.660
Yeah, then leave you start a new life. Yep somewhere else where the baby didn't burn out the house. Yeah life for you

21:34.700 --> 21:40.060
Yeah, how about another question? How about a yeah. Yeah another question. I'm currently living in a house

21:40.060 --> 21:46.140
That's directly connected to the other houses on either side. Is that a row home? Yeah. Yeah

21:46.940 --> 21:48.340
Yeah

21:48.340 --> 21:50.420
Is a rope row home a houseboat?

21:51.100 --> 21:52.100
No

21:52.100 --> 21:57.660
What it can be a bit cramped sometimes but it's actually a really nice house with a back deck that has a great view of

21:57.700 --> 22:02.780
Distant mountains and I would guess a really really great view of your neighbors

22:04.020 --> 22:05.380
Right there

22:05.380 --> 22:11.580
It can be a bit cramped sometimes. I realize there's a nice little couple that lives next door to us that are great neighbors

22:11.580 --> 22:16.180
And I have a mole that I'm worried about because they're just right there. I just see see their whole business

22:16.540 --> 22:20.100
But they're all they're out of their deck all the time

22:20.740 --> 22:27.660
This is a problem because our decks are directly connected and we're only separated by a thin wooden lattice

22:28.260 --> 22:34.140
Which means whenever my roommate and I sit outside we either have to ignore them or talk to them the whole time

22:34.140 --> 22:38.320
How could I enjoy the deck with my neighbors out there all the time Sarah?

22:38.320 --> 22:44.440
We could it could indirectly discourage them from being outside without being a bad neighbor. That's from I don't want to be a deckhead

22:45.000 --> 22:48.480
Now here's the thing about this right that I I didn't consider

22:48.880 --> 22:54.160
But now hearing you say that loud clicks for me if you have the option to ignore them

22:54.680 --> 22:58.320
Then that must mean they are not initiating

22:58.320 --> 23:05.840
Initiating the discussion with you, right? The question isn't every time we go out there. They tried to talk to us, right?

23:06.480 --> 23:13.800
So it seems like they've already made this decision for you and you keep interrupting them

23:14.840 --> 23:19.200
being intimidated by sorry what in being intimidated by

23:20.520 --> 23:28.160
Maybe having a conversation with your neighbors has such big 2020 energy that I don't really it's it's but it's also it's not a judgment

23:28.160 --> 23:30.160
on you don't want to be a deckhead because

23:30.760 --> 23:37.840
There but for the grace of God, I actually did I have gone I have been in this exact situation

23:37.840 --> 23:42.640
it is it is uncomfy one and the solution I found was do the front porch and

23:43.640 --> 23:48.060
That's it's essentially like when you share a room with somebody and you draw a line down the middle

23:48.400 --> 23:54.120
The front porch is yours and back porch is theirs and you don't have to send them a letter or anything

23:54.120 --> 23:58.080
They'll figure it out. But here's the thing what I'm saying is sitting here thinking about it

23:58.080 --> 24:02.520
Can you guys like I think it's really you know, what something in 2021?

24:02.520 --> 24:05.920
I want to do a better job. Okay is before we start just fucking

24:06.440 --> 24:13.360
Proviating I want to try to get into the mind's eye a little Oh of these question askers

24:13.360 --> 24:17.920
Yeah, I want you to try to crawl inside for a second. It's like sure it's like John Malkovich kind of thing

24:18.400 --> 24:24.680
Yeah, imagine you just fired up the grilling time playing list. That's your Jim Croce. Just blasted. All right. Yeah

24:24.680 --> 24:26.680
You don't

24:26.720 --> 24:32.680
Nice a nice plate of shrimp. Thank you. Just I don't trap don't I charge you crazy

24:32.680 --> 24:36.480
I was sorry. I was trying to set I thought we were doing like any it's a minds

24:36.480 --> 24:42.080
It's imagine. Yeah, but my my mind is very visceral. Actually, we Travis imagined so hard that you can fucking yeah

24:42.080 --> 24:46.360
That was not me. You got a big plate of shrimp. Okay, but I'm sorry. What kind

24:46.960 --> 24:51.000
Grilled well, they're already grilled ramp. Wait, wait, hold on

24:51.000 --> 24:55.760
Why did I turn on the grill if the shrimp are already grilled you didn't turn on the you just the grilling time?

24:55.760 --> 24:59.400
No, I said so I grilled in silence. We got a marinade on those bad boys

25:00.000 --> 25:06.560
No, it's already grilled. We're gonna yeah, I actually did do a nice little like olive oil lime juice

25:10.200 --> 25:13.880
Did I did I grill in silence before I sitting to the grilling time

25:14.120 --> 25:17.840
Playlist the shrimp you sauteed because the weather wasn't nice enough, but you said they were grilled

25:17.840 --> 25:23.140
Why am I lying to myself use the grill pan? I use the grill pan inside

25:24.000 --> 25:26.320
Then I came outside cuz the weather got better

25:27.000 --> 25:33.060
It warmed up in the class the Sun started peeking out. Are we gonna only take two minutes to grill shrimp?

25:34.280 --> 25:38.440
The more you guys argue the longer it is before we can eat these amazing

25:38.960 --> 25:46.720
Okay, we're starting. What kind of sides Justin? We're starting over with you with the cioppino. Okay, it's a peasant's dish

25:46.720 --> 25:50.000
You made it on this stove and you what am I drink?

25:50.680 --> 25:53.480
What am I drink and mall back? Oh with your piano?

25:55.560 --> 26:01.560
Don't even know what a mall back is but you're drinking a mall back. Well, it's nothing I'm now back is something Justin

26:01.840 --> 26:06.420
Here you fucking guys guys. I want to be honest a meaner. Can I have a convert some meaner?

26:06.820 --> 26:12.240
Can I be honest with you guys? Yeah, ever since Justin made the imaginary shrimp go away

26:12.240 --> 26:18.500
I've really been tuned out of the fucking podcast. There's shrimp in the cioppino. Well, then Justin you would put a red wine with

26:19.040 --> 26:25.960
Seafood you simpleton what's wrong with you? What's the okay now? All right now, I'm angry now. I'm angry now

26:25.960 --> 26:27.960
I'm googling. What's the best?

26:28.960 --> 26:30.180
wine

26:30.180 --> 26:35.680
pairing with a nice with a Michael Gino scratch now real nice. Yeah

26:35.680 --> 26:42.160
To Pete to pino to pino, you know, you know, it's a peasant's dish. Okay

26:42.160 --> 26:46.080
Yeah, you can say as many times as you want, but it's not gonna help me spell it and type it into a search browser

26:47.000 --> 26:49.720
It's not GIP I you know, see I oh

26:50.280 --> 26:53.680
PP I you know that PP. That's fucking awesome, man

26:54.680 --> 26:55.920
a

26:55.920 --> 26:57.180
Californian

26:57.180 --> 27:00.060
Charbonneau or an Italian Barbara de Austin. Yeah

27:00.680 --> 27:04.040
So you can like maybe like either one of those those are red wines

27:04.040 --> 27:10.320
This is a like super smart and a nice fruity zinfandel for your oh, yeah

27:10.920 --> 27:16.160
Deck. Yeah, you're eating cioppino. Yeah, and then you're just like sitting there and

27:17.440 --> 27:23.660
Also your elderly neighbor who I I want to give a little bit more character. Yeah, please. We're gonna call him

27:24.480 --> 27:28.740
Peter Parker, he's sitting out there on waste port V. Peter

27:28.740 --> 27:35.260
No, no different one a different one. I absolutely would have mentioned if he was spider-man and also the neighbor in this context would not have

27:35.740 --> 27:39.340
Access to the information the spider-man so it still could be spider-man

27:39.940 --> 27:45.180
Anyway, anyway, yeah, no not every these days. Are you kidding the point all these?

27:45.220 --> 27:50.460
yeah, so you look and you're just like I want you guys to seriously stop goofing for a second and

27:50.940 --> 27:53.860
imagine trying to eat your cioppino and just like

27:53.860 --> 28:02.520
Locking up. Wait, what I'm locking eyes with Peter. What are Peter Peter Parker and I guess their partner other Peter Parker doing

28:02.760 --> 28:08.640
Here's what's so frustrating is they're eating cioppino. Is it the same cioppino? It's a different cioppino

28:08.640 --> 28:14.640
And so the conversation is even more rich. There's tons to talk about now. It seems like we have a lot in common

28:14.640 --> 28:20.000
Why wouldn't we want to talk about it? It's it's not about not having anything in common. They like the neighbors

28:20.000 --> 28:25.040
Yeah, but they have too much in common and they feel like I'm sorry, but if I'm sitting six feet from you

28:25.040 --> 28:27.040
And we're both enjoying a nice

28:27.560 --> 28:32.460
Sorry, it's a really nice. Thank you. Right. Do you think maybe also they're trying to?

28:33.920 --> 28:38.040
You know, so they're trying to maybe they're trying to huff a doggie back in the backyard

28:40.240 --> 28:42.720
The elderly couple is trying to hook up with you and your roommate

28:43.720 --> 28:48.060
No, I'm saying you're in the backyard and you're trying this is your fucking house you live here

28:48.060 --> 28:53.120
You should be allowed to huff a doggie in the backyard if you want to but you don't know if they're cool or not

28:53.120 --> 28:56.120
And it's a thin lattice and there's holes in it

28:56.120 --> 28:58.340
So they'll be able to smell it and see it and know it

28:58.340 --> 29:00.340
Well at this point if you're both having a really good

29:00.900 --> 29:05.780
Cioppino then chances are they also want to huff a doggie and they're waiting for you to leave

29:09.240 --> 29:12.520
Man I don't even know cuz I said everybody try to spell

29:12.520 --> 29:19.040
Cioppino. I said Giacchino earlier talking about and now I can't stop thinking about Giacchino and I fuck it

29:19.040 --> 29:23.720
I'm so lost in the spelling. Thanks to Sunbasket by the way. Yeah former

29:24.200 --> 29:26.920
Pastor former my brother my brother me sponsor for

29:27.640 --> 29:32.880
Yeah, why I paid for it at this point. I'm still paying for it. But hey, thanks for sending such a nice Cioppino

29:32.880 --> 29:40.260
If we're gonna keep Justin in Cioppino, then we are gonna need your help with the maximum fun drive. Thank you

29:40.260 --> 29:45.100
Okay, we're finally getting to the meat of it. Why don't we talk a little bit more about these these?

29:47.860 --> 29:53.900
Please I think that may have been if you if you do like inverse

29:56.220 --> 29:57.660
Like

29:57.660 --> 30:02.100
That must be that might be the most we've ever talked about something and the hardest we've ever worked

30:02.380 --> 30:09.500
With the least amount of advice that came out of it. Yeah offered. I just wanted I wanted to mark that okay

30:09.500 --> 30:12.940
I wouldn't but I wouldn't have done that juice. I would have let that sail by

30:12.940 --> 30:15.940
I hope they didn't notice that we did such a dog shit job

30:15.940 --> 30:19.020
Yeah, because basically we're saying it's like hey, we did a shitty job

30:19.060 --> 30:24.140
And if you want us to keep doing a shitty job, maybe consider going to maximum fun dot org

31:01.280 --> 31:04.820

31:43.660 --> 31:49.580
Shrimp a lot. They're really they're fun. They're phenomenal phenomenal. They take so little time to cook

31:50.540 --> 31:52.220
Look at them

31:52.220 --> 31:53.900
They're fun

31:53.900 --> 31:59.300
Skewer if you want to watch if you want to wash those shrimp down with some hot tea

31:59.300 --> 32:04.740
That's you do you man you do you I am NOT gonna yuck your yum

32:04.740 --> 32:10.300
But if you want to join the diamond friendship circle at $20 a month you get one of the pins you get the membership card

some loose leaf tea and

32:24.260 --> 32:26.580
For the the loose leaf tea is orange tea

32:26.580 --> 32:30.980
Orange tea interstellar orange tea. I'm not doing a great job talking about this tea

32:30.980 --> 32:32.860
But that's just because I don't know much about tea

32:32.860 --> 32:37.100
but you also get a rocket strainer and a tray for you to use and enjoy and just like

32:37.900 --> 32:41.420
Just have just take a fucking break for like a minute

32:42.420 --> 32:47.100
And one other thing I wanted to mention about this is that I grilled shrimp on Monday

32:47.100 --> 32:51.860
I had red lobster on Tuesday and then made a nice chupino with shrimp in it last night

32:51.860 --> 32:56.620
I'm just sitting here like I've had shrimp three nights in a row and I probably need to calm down a little bit

32:57.020 --> 33:00.740
Anything in excess like that? Okay. Listen, I don't know what that has to do with the max fun drive

33:00.740 --> 33:04.440

Great to have your support this year because we didn't tour at all in the last 12 months 15 months actually, it's rough

34:33.340 --> 34:37.620

Hey, can I do a final yahoo from the past and I'm still workshopping a name for this segment also

34:57.540 --> 35:04.420
Okay, sure. This one is asked by an anonymous yahoo answers user who I'm gonna call

35:04.420 --> 35:06.420
Uh

35:09.620 --> 35:11.620
Asks

35:15.140 --> 35:17.140
I got that you're running out of

35:21.140 --> 35:23.140
Bail like the ancient

35:24.260 --> 35:29.500
Like the craven God the Moses smashed up. This one was sent in by

35:29.500 --> 35:31.500
Well

35:33.060 --> 35:37.140
No, this is this one was sitting by an unpronounceable series of characters

35:37.660 --> 35:43.660
No, this is actually the final yahoo from episode 7, which is actually titled Bill and Ted's most tender engagement

35:45.380 --> 35:51.380
Let's and it's been it has been 10 years since we have first floated this we have a decade of

35:52.060 --> 35:55.220
experience to come back to and the question is I

35:56.100 --> 35:58.180
Think I have Pepsi stuck in my lungs

35:58.180 --> 36:01.700
What should I what should I do, huh?

36:02.500 --> 36:04.500
Go to the hospital

36:04.540 --> 36:07.340
That's a great starting point Travis

36:08.060 --> 36:10.060
Oh

36:10.060 --> 36:12.700
I know inhale some Mentos

36:13.460 --> 36:19.460
Get it that seems like you've run the gamut. I'm bad and good. Well somewhere between those two

36:20.260 --> 36:22.860
yeah, um you I

36:22.860 --> 36:28.500
I mean you probably didn't cuz you got two different tubes, right?

36:28.500 --> 36:31.340
So if you try to put any liquid down, you guys know about this

36:31.340 --> 36:35.260
Yeah, but if you try to put liquid down the air tube there, she was like, I wish you would fuck this

36:35.260 --> 36:36.860
Don't you hate that choke?

36:36.860 --> 36:43.100
That cough that you get when a little bit goes down the wrong pipe and your body just like flips its entire shit

36:43.100 --> 36:45.220
Yeah that without fail, right?

36:45.220 --> 36:51.980
Everyone at the table like is on their feet like oh fuck. No

36:51.980 --> 36:57.020
No, he do something and there's always this moment where you're like now I'm a fucking asshole

36:57.020 --> 37:01.440
I just the liquid went down the wrong pipe and there's still this a moment where everybody's like

37:02.540 --> 37:04.700
Listen, we can't live with his death on our hands

37:04.700 --> 37:11.380
We got to do somebody somebody's got to do something listen to him joke and then even after they've accepted. Yeah

37:11.380 --> 37:16.860
Okay, maybe they're right. Maybe they are just an idiot that was gulping down their code read too quickly

37:16.900 --> 37:22.500
You'll have like one more follow-up joke and there's still an aftershock of everybody like oh god, it's back

37:23.820 --> 37:30.140
The problem is Justin is that your esophagus in that scenario is like that friend who had like maybe like a minor

37:30.540 --> 37:33.620
Car like, you know accident but like nothing major

37:33.620 --> 37:38.340
But then they keep telling the story for weeks because you'll keep having those little aftershocks. Oh

37:38.940 --> 37:40.660
Sorry, it's just oh

37:40.660 --> 37:42.060
Sorry, sorry

37:42.060 --> 37:46.660
Sorry, just getting it all the speed at which friend concern becomes like, all right, we fucking get it

37:46.660 --> 37:49.460
All right. Well area and what is everybody? What's the advice?

37:49.460 --> 37:54.820
I'm ready you should have a listen have it have a drink turn. Have a drink. I'm sorry. That's a way

37:54.820 --> 38:00.220
Sorry pause. Could you do that? Just a quick delivery note if you could do that a little more dynamically

38:00.220 --> 38:06.380
I think it would feel more like a segment from your stand-up comedy type five and what's everybody's if I you know

38:06.380 --> 38:08.180
I mean like if you could hit that

38:08.180 --> 38:11.940
Let's take another run tone. Yeah, that's shit. That's super shitty tone. You do

38:13.220 --> 38:18.040
Comedy that one when you're doing you're really transgressive comedy. Okay, go give it another chunk

38:20.580 --> 38:26.020
No, Justin Justin, please just no. Hey, it was a quick note. We'll fix it. Hey, you've made me extremely self-conscious

38:26.100 --> 38:30.460
No, we'll re-inject the momentum in post, you know, it's bad enough Trav that here in my 40s

38:30.460 --> 38:35.660
I feel like maybe I don't have the edge anymore that I used to as a younger performer and for you to just be like

38:35.660 --> 38:38.140
Like trying to act like I'm you know

38:39.540 --> 38:43.300
Insert a stand-up comedian that I would have no way of ever meeting and do not already

38:43.460 --> 38:47.300
Respect and also wouldn't get me in trouble for making fun of but you get the idea. Yeah

38:48.140 --> 38:51.880
Sorry, Joey bloops. I just made him up but at the speed that that shit turns around

38:52.820 --> 38:55.780
Haven't you done enough? I just googled actually Joey bloops is

38:56.540 --> 38:58.380
hugely problematic

38:58.380 --> 39:02.620
Yeah, it was the quickest turnaround from his inception in your mind's eye to

39:02.620 --> 39:05.040
making some tasteless jokes

39:06.100 --> 39:08.100
He just loves Rudy Giuliani

39:10.140 --> 39:12.140
Here's what's weird I thought I made up

39:16.660 --> 39:20.060
Rudy Giuliani like a drop-dead-fred character that someone created

39:25.380 --> 39:27.380
I want a much

39:27.380 --> 39:30.980
I want to

39:34.500 --> 39:36.500
Pepsi lung at all

39:36.820 --> 39:38.820
It was really hey

39:39.140 --> 39:40.420
I

39:40.420 --> 39:47.140
Think we used to this a great jumping-off point for doing some really edgy material and really transgressive. Yeah, okay. I have two

39:47.980 --> 39:50.580
quick updates from the the house or Taco Bell

39:50.580 --> 39:58.940
The first is great. They're the first in the industry to team up with TerraCycle to recycle hot sauce back. Oh boy

39:59.820 --> 40:01.820
That's good news, right?

40:02.220 --> 40:05.240
The container. Yeah the container or the sauce contained within

40:06.020 --> 40:11.700
Sure. Sorry. So it's this the container itself these flexible film packets

40:11.700 --> 40:14.420
There's currently no way to recycle them

40:14.420 --> 40:21.900
In fact as Liz Matthews talk about global chief food innovation officer says in the food industry today. There is no widely

40:22.180 --> 40:26.740
Available solution for recycling the flexible film packets that are so commonly used for condiments

40:26.860 --> 40:32.940
So we're thrilled to leverage the expertise of TerraCycle to recycle our iconic sauce packet packaging in a way

40:32.940 --> 40:40.420
That's as bold and innovative as our menu. Okay, so this is good. I mean, I'm yeah, I love it. I'm happy about this

40:40.420 --> 40:47.620
There's one little there's one little thing here. Oh, no, it's kind of that that I'm I'm sort of like I

40:48.780 --> 40:51.180
Think it's kind of strange. Okay. All right

40:51.700 --> 40:57.700
While the companies will announce details of a national u.s. Recycling pilot program later this year

40:58.620 --> 41:04.540
Customer participation will be easy and will incorporate free shipping. Wait. Oh

41:05.420 --> 41:09.080
Hold on. I am to send my empty packets

41:09.080 --> 41:16.280
So I guess what they're hinting at is that one of two things will happen either

41:17.160 --> 41:24.520
You will take home a pre-stamped envelope from Taco Bell that you use to save all of your rugged

41:25.080 --> 41:27.080
sports

41:27.640 --> 41:29.640
And once it is literally

41:30.560 --> 41:32.560
bulging at the seams

41:32.600 --> 41:38.720
You will put it in a truck and they'll take it to the recycling place so everyone can see the extent of your depravity

41:38.720 --> 41:44.020
Yeah option two you will walk into Taco Bell with an ant covered

41:44.400 --> 41:46.920
Walmart bag full of rotten

41:48.720 --> 41:50.720
Sauce packet rappers

41:51.740 --> 41:58.120
Absolutely, both are untenable. I'm thrilled about this future and big big credit to anybody

41:58.120 --> 42:02.980
That's willing to put the legwork in on this one for me. I'd rather just skip the sauce

42:03.640 --> 42:04.960
another

42:04.960 --> 42:08.480
probably think that could be is just every sauce packet is

42:09.360 --> 42:13.080
Like a postcard. It has every packet has a sauce

42:13.760 --> 42:16.920
As a stamp on it God, holy shit. I'm so tired

42:17.040 --> 42:21.460
But the joke was the joke was if you just you could mail the the packets, right?

42:21.560 --> 42:26.640
You put the packets in a mailbox, but then the joke thing I was gonna say is I was gonna say

42:26.720 --> 42:29.120
So everybody go ahead and just start doing that

42:29.800 --> 42:31.800
Taco Bell you

42:31.800 --> 42:34.780
Have done nothing over the past ten years

42:35.640 --> 42:38.280
But convince us that things can be food

42:38.720 --> 42:45.880
There's a lot of things where everybody at first is like this maybe isn't food and then you're like we just sold two billion of them

42:45.880 --> 42:53.840
So, what do you know? This is a prime example. You've been training for this moment make the food packets food if you call them

42:54.800 --> 42:56.800
Crunch helpers or whatever, you know

42:56.800 --> 43:02.040
I'm sure you could sell a but I bet you could get a bunch of them going wait Justin

43:02.040 --> 43:08.520
Are you saying that you think it's time for Taco Bell to see if they can convince the public?

43:09.160 --> 43:11.160
to to eat

43:11.280 --> 43:18.240
Sauce packets they could do that one of two ways one is edible sauce packet and the other is a lot dark

43:18.240 --> 43:25.880
Yeah, if they say if they pair this they say hey gang good news. We're bringing back Mexican pizza

43:25.880 --> 43:32.000
We know you missed it and you sneak into the press release. Also, the sauce packets are now called

43:33.320 --> 43:37.880
Tongue they're called tongue herders and they are so delicious and you

43:38.640 --> 43:41.160
they come in three ball three different flavors and

43:42.040 --> 43:48.920
You just go ahead and you do eat those now. You don't throw them away. You do eat those now. This is a new thing

43:48.920 --> 43:54.600
It's not a new product. Are you changing the formula of the packet? Is it now a torture? No, it's not a tortilla

43:54.600 --> 44:00.400
you we just want you to start eating those now and your napkin that would be good for if you're done with your

44:00.400 --> 44:04.580
napkin and your drinky cup go ahead and eat those that's now called a

44:06.120 --> 44:10.560
Tortilla fin and the drinky cup is called a

44:12.320 --> 44:14.560
Styrofoam poblano enjoy

44:16.200 --> 44:22.700
So that that's all great and then Taco Bell's like I know that that we have that one for you and I said listen TV

44:22.700 --> 44:23.940
I

44:23.940 --> 44:27.460
Jm here. We got the MFD. That's the max funder

44:27.940 --> 44:33.080
I'm gonna need you to come out with something real big. Okay, like yeah, we got you bud

44:33.220 --> 44:35.500
Cuz here's the headline I'm about to say to you

44:36.260 --> 44:38.300
Maximum fund out or first I joined please

44:38.300 --> 44:40.300
I just want to slip one in here subliminally

44:40.340 --> 44:45.620
Because you're about to be so delighted and thrilled that you'll be just throwing money at your podcast player

44:45.620 --> 44:52.540
Taco Bell enlists the moon to introduce the whole world to talk. Oh, no. Oh

44:55.860 --> 45:03.780
Here it goes on here's the subhead the earth a deck if you like when the moon looks like a taco on May 4th and

45:04.820 --> 45:09.220
Taco Bell fans in select locations around the globe can score a free taco

45:09.220 --> 45:15.940
What as part of its first ever global campaign when the moon looks like a taco?

45:16.740 --> 45:19.980
on May 4th in the seventh house

45:20.860 --> 45:28.540
The moon is known for some powerful influences from controlling Earth's tide to even affecting one's cravings

45:28.540 --> 45:33.040
I thought for sure they were gonna say monthly there and not

45:33.040 --> 45:39.560
Crack now to launch its first ever global campaign Taco Bell is using a billboard

45:39.960 --> 45:43.080
That the whole world can see that's not a moon

45:43.800 --> 45:49.000
That's a Taco Bell billboard. Now. It's claimed it. It's claimed it on May 4th

45:49.400 --> 45:54.480
Sorry, I missed it the May 4th the world's largest and brightest object in the night sky

45:55.240 --> 45:56.680
well

45:56.680 --> 46:01.560
Will resist that sentence does not hold up to scrutiny, but I'm not getting Neil back on the show

46:01.560 --> 46:08.440
Help us explain it. It will resemble a favorite indulgence the taco a new lunar phase

46:08.440 --> 46:11.320
We are affectionately calling the taco moon. No

46:12.240 --> 46:14.240
Taco moon is the only

46:14.480 --> 46:16.480
No, I'm angry

46:17.000 --> 46:17.840
No, trap

46:17.840 --> 46:24.400
It's the only side that fans need to score a Taco Bell taco when the taco moon arrives on May 4th

46:24.720 --> 46:30.280
Fans in the u.s. Can score its number one best-selling menu item a free crunchy taco

46:30.280 --> 46:36.660
I get you know, I guess if you have a menu item called a free crunchy taco. It probably is a pretty good seller

46:37.760 --> 46:39.760
Can I tell you why I'm angry? Oh

46:40.360 --> 46:42.880
Yes, and then I'll tell you why I'm delighted

46:42.880 --> 46:49.960
The headline makes it seem like the moon is complicit in this and just seems completely on the moon

46:49.960 --> 46:51.960
Did not have a say in its participation

46:52.760 --> 46:56.680
Yes, this and it makes it seem like the moon is like, you know what?

46:56.680 --> 47:03.520
It's the latest celebrity endorsement of time. But instead this would be like if they said hey whenever your friend Jerry

47:04.120 --> 47:10.240
Says I don't and it says Poughkeepsie you get a free talk like your friend Jerry didn't sign up for this

47:10.240 --> 47:15.340
This is a complete happenstance. It should say Taco Bell Dragoons the moon

47:17.000 --> 47:24.360
That what makes me happy is I don't think they realize these damn moons come back every month. So my next taco moon

47:24.360 --> 47:30.720
You know that the taco moon comes back or a half moon as the rest of us have called it for all of time

47:30.960 --> 47:35.920
The taco moon comes back. Do I get another pass? Oh, yeah, I should well, they can't say there's no rulebook

47:35.920 --> 47:43.120
It says they can't Justin more than 20 markets are gonna celebrate the taco moon. Not really US not really

47:43.560 --> 47:45.560
wide then huh

47:46.560 --> 47:49.400
Well Travis, I don't know what you want. Not everybody likes tacos

47:49.400 --> 47:54.460
So there's like all the different countries are gonna do it, but they're all giving it their own spin

47:54.460 --> 48:02.420
okay, for instance a free crunchy taco with the purchase of Beverly beverage in Guatemala and a free vegetarian crunchy taco available food delivery in

48:02.420 --> 48:08.460
India all of which combine local flavors with a Taco Bell twist what to end and the moon

48:09.420 --> 48:15.740
Taco Bell has been an established brand in the US for nearly 60 years and we are thrilled by the accelerating fandom

48:15.740 --> 48:17.260
We're seeing globally

48:17.260 --> 48:22.980
This is from the president Taco Bell International as we're opening more and more restaurants internationally

48:22.980 --> 48:26.440
We know the May 4th moon will take us to new

48:26.980 --> 48:28.980
Heights

48:29.100 --> 48:34.460
Because the moon is high because the moon is high it says here Heights

48:37.460 --> 48:41.900
Julie then paused for 30 seconds that she stared at the end of your Heights

48:44.220 --> 48:46.220
So this is

48:46.220 --> 48:49.820
The Bell plans to give away the most tacos is ever

48:50.340 --> 48:57.340
Has on a single day on May 4th when the saga of lunar phases ultimately displays its perfect half moon shape

48:57.340 --> 48:59.340
This is truly unhinged

49:00.260 --> 49:06.820
To announce the taco moon. There's a bunch of ads where the slogan is I see a taco and

49:07.720 --> 49:13.280
The taco cravings commence on May 4th and select markets as consumers recognize the power of the glowing taco moon

49:13.280 --> 49:17.600
This is literally the words on the page. No good words. I love words

49:17.600 --> 49:21.360
Yeah, Taco Bell is certain consumers were struck seeing tacos everywhere

49:21.400 --> 49:24.720
Which is really just the beginning of reaching ultimate brand fandom

49:24.720 --> 49:31.320
So they're hoping that the moon will burn the idea of tacos into consumers retina

49:31.320 --> 49:33.960
You will start yes that you will start seeing

49:34.720 --> 49:40.260
More than 20 markets are just want to return to the sentence because I cut the best part off more than 20 markets

49:40.260 --> 49:46.680
we'll celebrate the taco moon as the US but US based brand gives them a reason to try a taco and

49:47.280 --> 49:54.660
Ultimately experience what Taco Bell fandom is. Holy shit. Well, first of all, can we all just say thank you to Taco Bell an American-based

49:55.200 --> 49:58.720
Company for just spreading tacos throughout the world. Thank you

49:59.240 --> 50:05.120
I bet all the other countries that aren't America are so fucking jazzed to hear about

50:05.120 --> 50:12.240
That they took the moon that they got the moon and also that they got the moon. Does the moon have significance in your culture?

50:12.680 --> 50:17.680
Well, we're overriding that with a free crunchy taco. We call this a taco

50:18.680 --> 50:24.640
Basically what it is. So we take this flimsy thing and we make it hard and then we fill it with meaty

50:25.880 --> 50:28.240
Ingredients ever heard of it. You're welcome

50:29.040 --> 50:32.840
Sometimes we blast it in ranch. Hold on. What's ranch? Let me start

50:32.840 --> 50:36.680
We're gonna need some something sprinkled in the sky dish. Oh wait

50:38.360 --> 50:41.000
The stars are now ranch blasted flavor

50:41.760 --> 50:48.920
Okay, the Comets are sauce packets. The Sun is the oven that we use to cook the taco moon and

50:49.760 --> 50:54.080
If you see birds, well, those are nature's waiters bringing the taco moon

50:54.080 --> 51:03.640
Oh Pluto that's the Mexican pizza. It's gone now pizza. It's gone in the airplanes. Those are

51:04.920 --> 51:10.680
Plates for your they said they're gonna give away the most tacos they've ever done in a single day

51:10.680 --> 51:15.640
All right, and which means that all across this planet on May 4th if you sense a

51:16.640 --> 51:20.840
Disturbance in the force. It wasn't what is that Star Wars day? It was

51:20.840 --> 51:24.880
literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of people globally

51:25.360 --> 51:29.040
Walking into a restaurant and saying to the face of another human being the masked face

51:29.040 --> 51:35.000
Let's hope of another human being hi. I'm here for a free taco because of the moon sent me

51:36.120 --> 51:41.480
The man told me to come in and I knew it's time for free tacos. So that's why I'm here or

51:42.480 --> 51:44.480
alternately a bunch of

51:44.800 --> 51:46.160
employees

51:46.160 --> 51:49.440
staring into the face of an unwitting customer and saying the phrase

51:49.440 --> 51:53.080
So would you like to add a free taco because of how the moon looks right now?

51:55.360 --> 52:02.520
Justin you're all still assuming a certain level of confidence from the customer that I do not think is a lock for most folks including myself

52:03.040 --> 52:07.320
Where I would walk into the restaurant and my heat would be excuse me

52:07.320 --> 52:10.060
Is the moon right for a free taco?

52:10.240 --> 52:14.760
Is this the is the moon in the right way for me to get the free taco now, please?

52:14.760 --> 52:21.040
Is this the appropriate time for a free taco judging by the moon?

52:21.040 --> 52:27.360
Can I have a taco please? I think is all I would say. May I please have a taco now for zero money?

52:27.360 --> 52:31.560
I'd like a taco and if the moon says it's free, I will take you

52:32.760 --> 52:39.120
With the moon and see if I can have a taco. Can you open the porthole and look out and

52:39.120 --> 52:45.960
And let me know what the moon says. I took a picture of the moon on my phone. Is this any I know I'm two days late

52:48.720 --> 52:53.980
