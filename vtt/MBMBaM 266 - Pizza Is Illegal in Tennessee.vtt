00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Griffin has something he would like to talk about in the intro Justin. I don't know if it'll be funny or not

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
It's just like all I all I

00:07.640 --> 00:13.160
The only thing I can think about the only thing I want to do is listen to Carly Rae Jepsen's new album

00:13.920 --> 00:16.560
Okay, and I don't think it's gonna be like really funny

00:16.560 --> 00:19.960
In fact, I think it'll probably be like kind of weird. Like I think it'll be off-putting for people

00:20.700 --> 00:22.700
To hear me talk about this album

00:23.560 --> 00:26.960
Okay. Well, I mean if you think it'll be a good bit I don't that's what I'm saying

00:26.960 --> 00:28.040
I don't think it'll be a good bit

00:28.040 --> 00:33.300
It's just like I want to bring I want to bring a realness to this episode and for me like

00:33.440 --> 00:39.220
It doesn't get any realer. I gotta start now. I thought we started but we have to say our names and shit first

00:39.800 --> 00:45.400
No, we don't have to do we it's 266. We can't switch out convention now. All right, let her rip

00:45.680 --> 00:50.320
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:51.440 --> 00:56.260
Travis insists. He's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:56.260 --> 01:03.380
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

01:03.380 --> 01:27.380
What's up, you cool baby. It's familiar, but not too familiar. But not too not familiar. It's a new craze. And good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna. Just say hey I wanna.

01:27.380 --> 01:33.700
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy and you've just plugged into the podcast

01:34.100 --> 01:36.100

01:36.740 --> 01:43.280
Welcome to the ether. Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy and dude cyborgs dream of electric sheep

01:43.280 --> 01:46.820
Is that the way this is my this is my brother my brother made a vice show for the modern era

01:47.060 --> 01:49.060
I'm your we said that

01:49.420 --> 01:51.420
Welcome to the show

01:51.700 --> 01:54.580
So what album is everybody listening to you right now good for you go first

01:54.580 --> 01:57.340
Uh, okay, but I want to be the only thing that we talk about

01:57.340 --> 02:03.980
I don't want to hear I don't want to hear about your two albums. I was gonna say fallout boy. Is that okay? Oh, is that true?

02:04.940 --> 02:08.820
Listen, they a lot of people have been giving me a lot of shit. Have you ever actually listen?

02:08.820 --> 02:12.860
Yeah, they're really good really good American Beauty American Psycho is an amazing album

02:12.860 --> 02:19.460
Add me to the pile my dude and what we're at Griffin just to clarify. What were you going to say? I

02:19.460 --> 02:24.160
I don't want to come at I don't want to come at the discussion like this. Can we start over?

02:24.820 --> 02:27.300
I need you guys to be like you're not gonna

02:27.860 --> 02:33.940
You know, I just want to say we are too huge to alienate anybody my brother my brother and me from this point forward

02:34.460 --> 02:39.060
Loves everybody especially power players in the entertainment industry

02:39.060 --> 02:44.340
I love we're looking for connections and networking wherever it is if we could get fallout boy on the show

02:44.340 --> 02:47.500
That'll be a huge get I love the people fallout boy

02:47.500 --> 02:52.100
You can love the you can love the sinner but hate the sin, you know what I mean?

02:52.860 --> 02:57.900
I've been listening to Carly Rae Jepsen's emotion. I think that has pronounced because there's like a little dot

02:58.540 --> 02:59.900
between the

02:59.900 --> 03:06.340
Between the is it a mathematical formula like e equals m to the o of shun

03:06.540 --> 03:13.020
Uh-huh, and that's that how the the chorus of her hit single goes e to the m equals ocean

03:13.020 --> 03:18.300
It's probably the worst song on the album. And in fact, I wish that they hadn't titled the album motion

03:18.300 --> 03:23.780
I wish only seven seconds long. Yeah, it's kind of meandering and she doesn't even sing and she's got a beautiful voice

03:24.780 --> 03:28.340
That's the song that activates all the sleep the Canadian sleeper agents

03:28.340 --> 03:34.940
Oh, yeah, it's kind of like a like a rap CD where it's like an improv track right like kind of a comedy track

03:34.940 --> 03:35.140
Yeah

03:35.140 --> 03:40.820
She does a she does a bit there and Jamie Foxx shows up and does the bit also and then the two there are a few

03:40.820 --> 03:43.980
bits that her and Jamie Foxx do throughout the album and

03:44.460 --> 03:50.460
They're really they're really good. There's not a bad goof on the album. There's not a bad improv track on the album

03:51.220 --> 03:55.940
Again, I get again. I can't stress this enough not gonna be funny my me talking about this album

03:55.940 --> 04:01.060
It's it's just but you thought was very important to you. Nobody's talking about nobody out of your system

04:01.060 --> 04:04.300
Have you heard the album either of you? Nobody knows nobody's listening to this album

04:04.300 --> 04:10.460
It's a it's a I I feel like I'm just like running through the streets screaming her name and and it's falling on deaf ears

04:10.460 --> 04:16.700
No, I'm so busy talking about the Republican primaries. You know what I mean? No one's talking about Carly Rae Jepsen's album

04:16.700 --> 04:20.260
Let's talk about the real stuff. Well, okay, but if you're gonna pull pull that card

04:20.260 --> 04:23.900
we saw with the Republican primaries anybody everybody's talking about Donald Trump and I'm trying I'm

04:24.740 --> 04:30.900
Carly Rae Jepsen is the opposite of Donald Trump in every conceivable way. She is a pure being of light. I

04:33.820 --> 04:35.820
Remember it was the summer of

04:36.500 --> 04:38.180
20-something and

04:38.180 --> 04:45.620
Travis told us guys. This is the new shit. Yeah, this is the new heat and I did not believe him and

04:46.020 --> 04:50.820
Then literally two weeks later call me maybe was the only song I could hear on the right

04:50.820 --> 04:55.860
It was the only song available for download on iTunes. They cleared the table on every other song

04:55.860 --> 04:59.300
It was the only song on the radio and it was everywhere

04:59.300 --> 05:03.100
I tend to have a pretty good finger on the pulse of what's gonna be the summer jam

05:03.100 --> 05:09.700
Yeah, call me maybe and it was blurred lines and it was uptown funk. Yeah, and these are the summer jams people

05:10.220 --> 05:14.460
Blurred is there one this is Sidney was trying to figure out if there was a summer jam this year

05:15.220 --> 05:20.420
It was uptown funk. It was uptown funk. It's all over like Jane. What are you fucking talking?

05:20.420 --> 05:23.020
No, it was a slow build, but it was the summer jam

05:23.020 --> 05:29.220
The summer jam this year was don't get won't get fooled again by the who and it was a really super slow build

05:29.220 --> 05:33.500
But it really took off this uptown funk the one was like don't believe me just watch. Yeah

05:33.500 --> 05:38.900
Yeah, like the one that's which is way more fun to say, please don't look at my crotch if it's way better

05:38.900 --> 05:40.740
It's only

05:40.740 --> 05:44.480
They all he only wrote that song to license it to network promos

05:44.700 --> 05:48.660
like the only reason that song is this is cuz like so ABC and

05:49.300 --> 05:52.580
NBC and CBS will be like lining up all the shows you must watch

05:54.340 --> 05:56.260
Yeah

05:56.260 --> 06:01.560
Yeah, no, you don't have to change it. Like it's literally just like we got a great summer of hits for you

06:02.540 --> 06:08.700
NCIS is back. We've got perfect strangers to don't believe me. Just watch. It's a sequel to perfect strangers

06:08.700 --> 06:12.820
Oh, yeah, I you know what? I don't believe you and I will watch of course

06:13.540 --> 06:16.020
Guys, I just want to get in my guest bathroom

06:16.260 --> 06:19.060
Which is the only room in my house without a window

06:19.060 --> 06:25.860
Just turn the lights off and just sit in absolute darkness and put my headphones on and just let Jepsen carry me away

06:26.540 --> 06:31.740
Cut some lilies let him float on the bathtub waters little lavender. No, I don't even want

06:31.740 --> 06:36.540
I don't want my sense of smell distracting me from my sense of hearing. I just I just want to hear the music

06:37.180 --> 06:42.080
You just want to get a sensory deprivation chamber and float in Jepsen. Yes

06:43.220 --> 06:47.020
Whist away. I want to go on a Carly Rae voyage into myself

06:47.020 --> 06:48.380
Myself

06:48.380 --> 06:50.380
This is an advice show

06:51.980 --> 06:54.980
Basically you want I will say though full disclosure

06:55.480 --> 07:02.060
Griffin did warn us that talking about Carly Rae Jepsen's new album would not be funny. He said that before we started

07:02.060 --> 07:07.460
Yeah, well and that was on the podcast. Yeah, you guys don't know this but I included that. Oh, okay good

07:08.260 --> 07:13.500
What's your favorite for the music? That would be a twist. What's your favorite song on the album? I'll tell him funk

07:13.500 --> 07:18.380
on Carly Rae Jepsen's new album emotion emotion

07:19.820 --> 07:21.180
I

07:21.180 --> 07:24.100
Like that justice remix what?

07:24.740 --> 07:27.300
Where they remixed that one song with justice

07:28.140 --> 07:32.440
And I think Dizzy Rascal did the original and then it was on Carly Rae Jepsen's

07:32.440 --> 07:36.240
You know Dizzy Rascal rented out a track of Carly Rae Jepsen's new album

07:36.240 --> 07:43.400
He's did you know Dizzy Rascal is subletting a track number seven on Carly Rae Jepsen's new album just to get out to the people

07:44.260 --> 07:49.780
She wasn't gonna use it. No, she wasn't gonna use see she said I was just gonna put another Jamie Foxx

07:49.980 --> 07:56.060
It Jamie Foxx had this bit where he was gonna be a very old Jesus named Jesus sort of like geezer

07:56.060 --> 07:59.640
Yeah, and she didn't really think it was that funny. So she let Dizzy Rascal sublet the track

07:59.640 --> 08:03.000
Yeah track seven, of course is making the most of the night and that one's a club banger

08:03.000 --> 08:07.220
Like that would be a good that would actually I could see Dizzy doing some really dope shit with that

08:07.380 --> 08:11.780
Should we get on to the questions? I feel like I would give anything. Yeah, I would pay any any price

08:12.180 --> 08:15.980
Do you have that power? Yeah, I can do it. I just do it

08:15.980 --> 08:19.020
I have a friend that's been recently drive me off the wall

08:20.020 --> 08:25.380
He for someone that's another album that Carly Rae Jepsen's new album is better than it's better than Michael Jackson's off the wall

08:25.580 --> 08:30.180
Absolutely for some unknown reason has all of a sudden started using the word mate

08:30.180 --> 08:33.740
when clear when addressing someone when he speaks

08:34.500 --> 08:41.780
As if he came back from a life-changing year-long expedition in the wilds of Australia. It has adopted the language. He clearly isn't

08:42.180 --> 08:43.980
Australian

08:43.980 --> 08:45.980
He's clearly Canadian

08:46.860 --> 08:52.380
Have to hear him. Call me mate one more time. This friendship is going down under

08:53.380 --> 08:56.820
I felt like Casey Kasem and now another one go. Oh, that's because

08:56.820 --> 09:00.840
It's because you're talking exactly like Casey Kasem for some reason. That would do it every time

09:01.260 --> 09:07.140
Maybe it's from the group of guys he games with online. Maybe they're all Australian and he's trying to fit in

09:07.500 --> 09:13.820
How can I make him realize the error of his ways brothers? That's a frustrated frecklekin in

09:14.980 --> 09:18.820
Yeah, fuck way for quiet. I believe for quiet. I

09:19.900 --> 09:21.900
Don't think it's fuck way

09:22.540 --> 09:24.540
Probably not fuck way

09:24.540 --> 09:29.340
Um hi, I'm Gordon. I'm Gordon fuck way, and this is the Alfre do

09:30.820 --> 09:37.060
It's a very sexual sexual Alfre it stands for alien. I'd like to fuck I am

09:38.340 --> 09:42.660
My name is Dalf what is that? What does he mean? I'm a mouth

09:43.620 --> 09:46.940
It's not TV. It's HBO. Yeah, and it's raw

09:48.700 --> 09:50.700
So this is the worst

09:51.460 --> 09:53.460
possible

09:53.460 --> 09:55.340
Yeah

09:55.340 --> 09:58.100
There's no excuse. There's no excuse for this

09:58.860 --> 10:02.660
It's it's probably the worst affect and there are a lot of really bad affectations

10:02.660 --> 10:05.960
You just start doing for some reason this one's the this one's the worst

10:06.460 --> 10:10.760
Maybe you know it's your friend of some sort of researcher trying to find the worst possible

10:11.100 --> 10:15.540
Affectation because he found it and what makes it double worse is that there's no bay

10:15.540 --> 10:21.180
Like at least if he had come back from like a two-week vacation in Australia

10:21.180 --> 10:28.160
Then you're like oh, you're trying it, but with no basis for it. It's just this like amorphous blob

10:28.740 --> 10:35.940
Mysterious worst have you guys ever had an affectation that was really hard to shake that you're embarrassed to admit

10:37.380 --> 10:42.600
Definitely definitely right. I mean I still do it when I went to

10:43.500 --> 10:48.060
the UK for my honeymoon I came back saying cheers a lot like

10:48.060 --> 10:55.100
Cheers like like just as a standard greeting or goodbye or whatever to say cheers a lot

10:55.420 --> 11:01.260
One time is out at a Japanese restaurant with some friends. I said come pie when my drinks came and

11:03.060 --> 11:04.260
I fucking vomited

11:04.260 --> 11:10.940
Just checked out vomited just knowing that in the future. I would look back on that moment. It's such a deep deep

11:11.620 --> 11:13.140
cosmic shame

11:13.140 --> 11:15.140
Bloody snuck its way into my vocab

11:15.140 --> 11:17.140
I

11:18.260 --> 11:21.380
Did I'm not proud of a minute, but it did it's not in there

11:21.380 --> 11:26.260
I'm not saying like we should be clear here. I'm not judging. We're not judging like

11:26.980 --> 11:28.980
the actual

11:29.300 --> 11:35.420
Affect like the actual like slang and accents of another nation that that is fine

11:35.420 --> 11:41.380
Yeah, you everybody has their thing. It's the the appropriation of it. Yeah

11:41.380 --> 11:45.500
It can go opting. Yeah, can you do it for so long though that you?

11:46.300 --> 11:52.680
Own it like if this person says mate for so long eventually you'll forget this the the impetus right the first thing

11:52.820 --> 11:56.380
Like if I just start answering the phone every time anybody calls me like mushy mushy

11:57.340 --> 12:00.580
And but I do that for like six years. Do you think I'll stop you?

12:00.580 --> 12:04.540
Well, you'll become the guy who's known for doing it because he's terrible

12:04.540 --> 12:11.100
um, but then but then it's still I think it would retroactively shape you in a way that you couldn't recover from like I think you

12:11.100 --> 12:13.100
could stick in your car, but like a

12:13.860 --> 12:20.660
Grain of sand in an oyster shell you eventually would form a pearl of being terrible around it. Mm-hmm

12:21.100 --> 12:23.100
around the irritant I

12:23.600 --> 12:30.100
Think that when your friend does this you need to shake an empty pop can full of pennies at him. No. Hey, no

12:30.100 --> 12:32.100
No

12:32.980 --> 12:37.180
Can or have you said anything is it like does he know

12:37.900 --> 12:41.260
Like oh, he knows we've noticed and we hate it

12:41.260 --> 12:46.700
He knows Justin earlier said that the word bloody snuck into his his vocab. It didn't sneak into shit

12:46.700 --> 12:51.980
It's it wasn't it didn't it didn't put a cardboard box over itself and then like worm its way into your brain

12:52.020 --> 12:56.900
You sat there thinking like okay, here it comes. God. I hope this works. Yeah, bloody well, right, huh?

12:56.900 --> 13:00.700
And everybody look at you do it and you do it the first time then it's like, oh

13:02.900 --> 13:05.140
Felt kind of good. Hey, nobody said anything

13:05.140 --> 13:08.900
It's not because nobody said anything because they were like terrified

13:08.900 --> 13:15.620
It was the word they love you so much and they're terrified that this is just gonna be you now. Yeah

13:16.340 --> 13:18.380
That's just gonna be the person they know. I

13:20.020 --> 13:25.060
Don't know how you write this ship. I don't know if you call out once it's gonna be really hard for you

13:25.060 --> 13:28.900
But he will never do it again, right if Sydney looked at you and said Justin you sound

13:29.540 --> 13:34.300
Completely like a clown when you just said bloody just then you sound like an idiot clown child

13:34.940 --> 13:36.260
Might I suggest?

13:36.260 --> 13:41.460
Yeah a full-on like to catch a predator moment, right where you're at a party

13:41.460 --> 13:44.660
And I know this is this isn't how it happens in to catch a predator

13:44.660 --> 13:47.180
It would be really weird if it was but you're at a party

13:47.180 --> 13:49.940
He says me you lay your hand on his shoulder and you say hey

13:49.940 --> 13:53.900
Can I talk to you in the kitchen and you take him in and go I just want to break down what just happened there

13:53.900 --> 13:56.860
You did this thing. Everybody thought you sounded dumb

13:56.960 --> 14:00.140
Do you really want to walk back into that room right now and say it again?

14:00.460 --> 14:06.060
Just think about that before you come back in I'll be in the living room. Yeah, please don't like yeah

14:06.060 --> 14:12.260
You're basically grounding him. Yeah from conversation like hey. Hey fly boy. I'm taking away your license

14:12.340 --> 14:18.640
You're on you're on probation. I want you to really think about what you did before you re-enter humanity

14:18.640 --> 14:24.080
Can you adopt an even more obscure Australian affectation?

14:25.080 --> 14:29.560
Let me throw this out crikey. Well, it's not really even more obscure

14:29.560 --> 14:34.280
I was thinking no one's that maybe a shrimp on the barbie. No, I was thinking it's a little thing

14:34.280 --> 14:39.800
I was thinking like that's a noise but like completely out of like completely out of

14:41.240 --> 14:43.240
Well, that's a lot

14:43.240 --> 14:48.600
He didn't see someone with a knife and just identify it as a knife. He's a knife. Oh

14:49.240 --> 14:55.100
Nice in it, but I hold that right there. There's a hand in it. Oh, it's a bloody. No

14:55.880 --> 14:59.400
No, I'm cool. You've solved the crime

15:01.120 --> 15:09.420
What's the murder weapon listen noise, yeah, there were stab wounds that seems really likely good work inside in CIS Dundee I

15:09.420 --> 15:15.380
Don't think they'd call it in CIS Dundee. They'd probably call it in CIS Australia. Do you guys know yahoo?

15:16.020 --> 15:17.340
Sure. Yeah

15:17.340 --> 15:24.260
This yahoo was sent in by level 9000 yahoo drew drew drew Davenport. Thank you drew. It's by yahoo answers user. They're anonymous

15:24.940 --> 15:26.940
We'll call them mock a dial then D

15:27.740 --> 15:31.220
They asked in the category society and culture etiquette. I

15:32.800 --> 15:36.340
Want to join a local biker gang, but I don't care about bikes

15:36.340 --> 15:39.620
Should I be up front about this or would it be wiser to pretend?

15:41.620 --> 15:43.620
So walk me through

15:43.980 --> 15:50.400
There's two sentences. How did you get lost? No, no, no how that first interaction went. Hello fellows

15:50.400 --> 15:58.280
I like your lifestyle. Hello. I do not care about these metal things. Hi there my two my two-wheeled compatriots

15:59.620 --> 16:03.180
Hail and well met you have a place for a Subaru

16:03.180 --> 16:07.980
I can take all the bags and the cooler and stuff

16:08.260 --> 16:13.260
That is true when they have beach day. You are going to be quite prized

16:13.260 --> 16:16.620
They can't those folding chairs and on the back of them motorbikes

16:16.620 --> 16:19.780
They're gonna be so stoked about your Honda fit and all its roomy

16:20.620 --> 16:25.840
Backseat, I can't wait. I just ordered some new handlebars for my Harvey Danielson

16:25.840 --> 16:30.480
It's a Harvey Danielson good bike and it's from their 2010 good bike model

16:30.480 --> 16:34.880
Which is an antique at this point and I have new handlebars coming for it

16:34.880 --> 16:38.880
And they pop off like the handlebars and Pee-wee's big adventure. So if any of you

16:39.520 --> 16:44.360
Road dogs tries to yank my grip off and make me get a road rash

16:44.600 --> 16:48.840
Then the handlebar will come right off in your hand and I will cruise off in my Harvey Danielson

16:49.440 --> 16:52.440
Unscathed no road rash here. How long?

16:52.440 --> 16:55.400
Unscathed no road rash here. How long?

16:56.000 --> 17:01.640
Could you keep the grift going like well my I have again guys my

17:02.280 --> 17:08.060
Motorcycle that I own room Queen. She's in the shop again. Gosh, man

17:08.060 --> 17:11.360
I just really go got arrested. I don't know what I can tell you guys

17:11.360 --> 17:15.440
I get room Queen out of hock and you know, cuz I sold her for

17:15.440 --> 17:22.920
Biker drugs and now I am without wheels. Let me say once more. I am NOT a cop

17:24.160 --> 17:30.240
I want to tell everybody I appreciate your ride your offer of a ride to

17:30.600 --> 17:37.400
The motor meetings and I just want to tell you it's not that I'm afraid of motorcycles very very very much

17:37.760 --> 17:39.560
But it's just that

17:39.560 --> 17:41.560
hemorrhoids, you know

17:41.880 --> 17:43.600
hemorrhoids I

17:43.600 --> 17:47.320
Have to point out they're not afraid of motorcycles. They just don't give a shit. Ah

17:47.880 --> 17:54.720
These guys in their bikes. I love it's it's I love the people and I love the community. I I love like

17:56.000 --> 18:01.720
What do biker gangs do I loved watching Sons of Anarchy like that's what it is. It's just that it's like

18:01.720 --> 18:05.880
I watched Sons of Anarchy. I want to do crime. I want to hate other races

18:05.880 --> 18:10.600
I don't want to invest in a motorcycle. I want to lean over pool tables a lot

18:10.600 --> 18:14.480
I feel like that happens in biker gang like they go to places where there was a pool table

18:14.480 --> 18:19.280
They lean over and then glare at the people that walk in. Yeah, like that's the thing that happened. Yeah. Yeah

18:20.000 --> 18:22.140
Maybe community service. I don't know

18:22.140 --> 18:29.460
There are biker gangs that I'm sure are like this is more of like an affiliation of like like-minded people who also just ride

18:29.680 --> 18:35.100
Motorcycles, but mostly we're all about like cleaning up the streets and building parks for kids who cares?

18:35.160 --> 18:38.440
There's a core idea. That is we ride motor

18:38.440 --> 18:42.360
Also finds us and it's bikes

18:42.820 --> 18:49.440
Yeah, that's the one thing that you can't we kind of like have to get on the same page with that is shitty

18:49.440 --> 18:52.200
though if you think about it that like if you did just

18:52.960 --> 18:59.440
Maybe you just love motorcycles, but like you can't afford one. Like you just can't you have a kid

18:59.660 --> 19:03.480
You have one car that your car seat fits into and that's it

19:03.480 --> 19:06.940
Yeah, like you just can't afford a motorcycle. You just love the lifestyle

19:06.940 --> 19:10.340
It's rabbit. You can still be in that gang. I think so, too

19:11.020 --> 19:17.180
But only in that only in that like I'm saving up or do you guys have like a spare I can use

19:17.620 --> 19:20.580
Until I can afford my own because here's what you want

19:20.580 --> 19:23.980
This is what you do Justin you go down to the local local junkyard

19:24.020 --> 19:29.900
You buy like an old old beat-up like whole no one would ever want to ride that motorcycle again

19:29.900 --> 19:31.220
But then you put love into it

19:31.220 --> 19:36.820
I'll fix it and you buy stuff like a second hand and you're fixing up and is it the prettiest motorcycle?

19:36.820 --> 19:41.380
No, no, it's not. In fact people at the the rich kids motorcycle gang

19:41.380 --> 19:46.460
They make fun of you, but those guys down the street that are maybe past their prime. They welcome you

19:46.460 --> 19:48.420
Yeah, they do and then at the big motorcycle race

19:48.420 --> 19:52.980
Oh boy, your motorcycle wins because it's filled with love and magic and nitro

19:52.980 --> 19:56.020
So this is a script then that you've just written for listen

19:56.020 --> 19:59.020
If somebody would like to pay me for this property, what's it called the property?

19:59.900 --> 20:04.660
real quick motor motor motor motor motor bike good friends

20:04.660 --> 20:07.260
Okay, I say that's a great title for it

20:07.260 --> 20:13.820
I would just sit outside with a sidecar and just sit out there with my stupid goggles and my helmet and when they came

20:13.820 --> 20:19.780
Out to go do crime or community service or just go to Wendy's I would just be like well who's got room

20:20.260 --> 20:24.020
Who wants the kid today? I'd be like a mascot. You know, I like that

20:24.020 --> 20:27.180
What would you and what would you I hate to keep putting you guys on the spot

20:27.180 --> 20:31.580
But what would your mascot name be because I feel like that's important to the biker game dead weight

20:31.580 --> 20:37.140
Almost certainly. Yeah, that's I mean almost certainly dead. I tell you how I'm getting good with a biker gang is

20:37.340 --> 20:41.940
Other than the fact that I can probably do like more smack than anyone in one go

20:41.940 --> 20:44.580
I've never done that, but I feel like I'd be really good at it

20:44.580 --> 20:49.380
That's how you won president of the student body in high school. That's true. Somebody hand me a big bag of smack

20:49.380 --> 20:53.820
It was like I bet you can't do all this like watch me go crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch

20:53.820 --> 20:56.620
I think that's how you do it. I think you

20:56.620 --> 21:03.060
Slurp slurp slurp slurp slurp how I get into the biker gang is I would I would have a bike that I fixed up like

21:03.060 --> 21:05.620
Travis said basically the plot of motorbike good friends

21:05.660 --> 21:09.460
But where I would twist it is instead of filling it with love I fill with gadgets

21:09.820 --> 21:15.180
Wouldn't that be cool if like I did have like the the handlebars that popped off and I could like shoot out an oil slick

21:15.180 --> 21:17.180
and I could

21:18.020 --> 21:22.980
Drop some cow trips. You're talking about motorbike good friends after the studio notes

21:22.980 --> 21:26.560
Yeah, where they're like in the bike anymore of a like a chitty chitty bang now

21:26.560 --> 21:33.920
Can the bike talk so we can cast Peter Dinklage as you know what Griffin is that kind of shit that ruined motorbike good friends one?

21:33.920 --> 21:36.580
I don't want to see it in motorbike good friends, too

21:36.580 --> 21:38.580
It's more kind of a back to the can I say that?

21:38.700 --> 21:44.420
Motorbike good friends 2 sounds like an origin story. Are you rebooting it that quick? It's a prequel. It's a

21:46.660 --> 21:49.140
Guy on a bike and it's like don't ask any questions

21:49.140 --> 21:53.020
Yeah, yeah, and everybody's like where did he get this motorcycle?

21:53.020 --> 21:57.900
I wish there's another movie explain this I have a foolproof plan for infiltrating the biker gang and

21:58.500 --> 22:04.960
Endearing myself to them. It is multi-tiered. It is very complex. It is one word. I'm gonna hit you with it now

22:04.960 --> 22:06.960
You ready? Yes tequila

22:07.380 --> 22:12.340
Like the song I just do this funny dance on a counter and then everybody be like I'm into it

22:12.340 --> 22:14.860
I like what he points at his wiener and then also his butt

22:14.860 --> 22:21.220
He's in the gang and I like his white shoes now. Hold on. Don't think that peewee's actual move. Yeah

22:21.220 --> 22:27.980
I don't think that's why they enjoyed his dance. So like I feel like it was just like a fun moment in a kid's movie

22:27.980 --> 22:31.640
I don't think he was like my dick my dick my butt but but but my dick

22:32.380 --> 22:34.380
again, I said my

22:34.580 --> 22:36.580
butt but

22:36.780 --> 22:37.980
Watch that scene again

22:37.980 --> 22:41.220
And then travel back in time to the late 80s and see me

22:41.220 --> 22:47.020
emulating that scene at home and tell me I'm not pointing at my dick and then my butt because that's what I thought it was

22:47.020 --> 22:51.020
and I until I mean, I thought that for a long time until

22:54.180 --> 22:55.980
1.30

22:55.980 --> 23:01.920
Today just now I thought he was playing. Are you sure he's not pointing at his dick and then his butt?

23:03.060 --> 23:09.860
I'm like 99% sure it's not he's not doing a dick to like I was I was like like pointing as privates

23:09.860 --> 23:16.140
And that's what made it so like that would be a weird thing to do in front of a big group of bikers who?

23:16.500 --> 23:22.460
Moments ago. We're going to kill. Yeah, I would love so he got up on a bar and said look

23:22.460 --> 23:24.540
I think dick and my butt a lot

23:24.540 --> 23:31.620
What if in the reboot of peewee's big adventure that the biker gang at the at the bar was ms13 and

23:31.980 --> 23:35.940
They were like, is he pointing at his dick? Oh, man, that's great

23:35.940 --> 23:41.540
But then they cut off his head and throw it in the river what I'm saying to you right now is I'm looking at the movie

23:41.540 --> 23:45.740
He's pointing at his dick in his butt. You're watching the scene right now. That's what he does

23:45.740 --> 23:49.860
I'm seeing his dick in his butt like he's indicating like here's my penis. Here's my butt

23:49.860 --> 23:56.100
It looks like an instructional video for what dick and but for where the dick and buddy is who would do what's the market for?

23:56.100 --> 23:58.100
that video I

23:59.060 --> 24:01.060
Anatomy classes mainly

24:01.060 --> 24:06.540
Very remedial and anatomy classes. All right, let me check out this video here. All right, let's know

24:06.540 --> 24:09.500
I guess let's all watch the tequila dance from peewee's big adventure

24:09.500 --> 24:13.540
I'll just send you guys a direct link set exactly the timecode and

24:13.900 --> 24:19.940
You will you will see you will and you at home just search peewee tequila on you

24:19.940 --> 24:24.300
It's just a silly dance. He puts on these weird shoes and does a silly dance on a park

24:24.300 --> 24:30.180
He's pointing at his dick and then after that his butt that's what he's doing

24:30.180 --> 24:35.740
Why would that disarm the gang? I didn't because he's making he's not at all Justin

24:35.740 --> 24:41.140
He is definitely poor like dick dick, but but dick dick, but but that's what he's doing. If you

24:41.860 --> 24:46.500
Meaning like he is he's using fists. There's no extended fingers. Those are his fists

24:46.820 --> 24:52.180
This video is too low quality to see if their fingers or not. He is like in the general genital area

24:52.180 --> 24:57.820
I agree with you, but he is in no way directly indicating. These are my genitals. He just he's oh wait

24:57.820 --> 25:03.780
I'm watching it now. I'm watching it now and he's drawing actually slow concentric circles around his dick and he's mouthing the words

25:03.780 --> 25:05.780
It's right here. It's right here. It's right here

25:06.020 --> 25:12.180
Why why oh my god, I'm still watching it. He just pulled his pants down and he's spreading his gaping asshole

25:13.420 --> 25:15.420
tequila

25:15.900 --> 25:21.380
My read on the scene is that he's making himself out to be a tantalizing piece of boy flesh

25:21.380 --> 25:27.460
Yeah, too perfect for them to ruin with simple violence for him destroying their motorcycles

25:27.460 --> 25:32.860
Yeah, he's a he's a primo fuckboy and they're gonna wanna keep him around. That's what he's saying. That's what I'm saying

25:32.860 --> 25:38.500
Oh my god. He actually just hold on. Hold on. Stop stop talking. Yeah, he just said I'm a primo fuckboy

25:38.500 --> 25:44.620
How have I watched this movie hundreds of times? How have I not like I just like glossed over the scene, I guess

25:45.540 --> 25:47.540
tequila tequila

25:48.380 --> 25:51.060
They love it too. They love it

25:51.060 --> 25:56.820
I love it. Well, he got out of another scrape. No

26:00.220 --> 26:06.540
All life-threatening scrapes that Pee Wee Herman gets out of by exposing his dick and his gaping butthole to perfect strangers

26:06.540 --> 26:11.100
Listen, I didn't write the scene now watched it and interpreted it. You know what?

26:11.100 --> 26:14.100
I could I'll tell you this director Tim Burton me and

26:14.100 --> 26:21.180
Paul Rubens may be author of that film they may have may have created that vision but I as an audience member my

26:21.340 --> 26:27.860
Interpretation that scene is just as valid as layers. So if I say he is pointing his dick and then his butt that's how the art

26:28.740 --> 26:35.260
Manifested itself to me. That's the Mandela effect. Yeah talk about Justin and eventually people in the future will be like

26:35.260 --> 26:35.780
Oh, yeah, of course

26:35.780 --> 26:39.780
He got his dick out in Pee Wee's big adventure and people would be like did yeah

26:39.780 --> 26:45.140
I mean I remember that and then people watch the movie go, you know a fun fact. He never actually says

26:45.140 --> 26:51.100
I'm a pretty well fuck boy in the movie. He doesn't he doesn't I don't spread misinformation traps. He did just say that I

26:51.740 --> 26:54.960
Just I literally just watched it

26:55.380 --> 26:59.700
So I find it ironic that in the movie he gets out of trouble by showing his dick

26:59.700 --> 27:02.620
But in real life he got into a lot of trouble by getting his dick out

27:02.620 --> 27:05.660
Well, yeah, it's because he ran into some trouble and he was like, let me get my dick out

27:05.660 --> 27:10.440
But that's not you're not in the fictional. This isn't this isn't cool world Pee Wee

27:11.060 --> 27:14.560
You're in the real space who framed Roger Rabbit

27:14.560 --> 27:21.200
Yeah, if you can't get out of a cartoon, you can't get out of a cartoon scrape by showing us your colon

27:21.900 --> 27:25.340
It's not how it works out here in the physical realm

27:26.380 --> 27:31.780
They're like, I can't believe we got tricked by that. We should still arrest him right? Like we got to cover this up. Yeah

27:31.780 --> 27:36.600
He is a spitting a lot of people nut. He's getting a speeding ticket and got a stick out. He's like

27:38.380 --> 27:40.860
Yeah, and they're like, yep that you're free to go

27:42.180 --> 27:43.740
tequila

27:43.740 --> 27:45.740
Let's go the money's on

27:45.740 --> 27:52.740

27:55.220 --> 27:57.220

28:36.620 --> 28:38.620
We'll buy you a house if you like them

28:38.620 --> 28:40.620
Yeah, that's not what they're saying

28:40.620 --> 28:44.240
But they could because no one will ever do that Travis you and tell us about the other one

28:44.240 --> 28:48.240
I do. We also want to talk about base camp. We've mentioned base camp a couple times on the show

28:48.780 --> 28:51.740
Basically how it works is you know in this digital age?

28:51.900 --> 28:54.140
Everyone doesn't always work in the same office anymore

28:54.140 --> 28:57.700
Sometimes you're spread throughout the world and it can get hard to

28:58.180 --> 29:04.900
Get on the same page when it comes to completing projects with base camp base camp makes it easier to wrangle people with different roles

29:05.180 --> 29:08.980
Responsibilities and objectives towards their common goal and then lets you finish that project together

29:08.980 --> 29:14.900
Everybody gets on the same page Deborah over in Montana doesn't get to it like say like oh I didn't know if that's what

29:14.900 --> 29:21.180
I was do God Deborah get it together. You fucking we have a cloud platform for this Deborah

30:35.840 --> 30:42.260
It's Zveni baby music.com to download Zveni babies debut album painting pictures

30:42.260 --> 30:46.380
Sorry, they're what I must their debut album debut album

30:46.720 --> 30:52.320
So I said painting pictures, which I will reiterate include songs based on the dark towers

30:52.320 --> 30:58.220
So I'm like really stoked. I'm totally gonna go listen that because cause like what?

30:59.780 --> 31:03.500
Here's a song from it right now monster house. It's a monster house

31:04.020 --> 31:10.600
Everyone look out for the monster house, and then here's another song. Oh, no. It's a crab monster

31:10.600 --> 31:14.420
He's got poison his claws, and he's gonna come bite my fingers off

31:15.060 --> 31:19.420
That got a little for you was that Stephen King. I thought it was Stephen King

31:19.420 --> 31:23.940
He wrote this book, but now he's in the book. I didn't I haven't gotten that far

31:29.620 --> 31:35.500
Happen I'm only on the fourth book you'll get there. You'll get a push listen everybody gets hung up a wizard

31:35.500 --> 31:37.500
And that's cuz it's a shitty shitty

31:37.500 --> 31:43.340
14,000 page book is actually it's actually a very great book. It's just a real

31:43.340 --> 31:48.540
derailment of the nothing to do with the last

31:49.020 --> 31:55.860
Have it really goes free prior around a train that's gonna explode unless we solve this mystery to hold up before we get back

31:55.860 --> 31:58.340
To that though before we resolve that situation. Here's

31:59.020 --> 32:01.020
950 pages about schoolboys

32:01.620 --> 32:05.860
It is kind of a crazy thing to be like cliffhanger and before we get back to that

32:05.860 --> 32:10.900
Let me just read you a quick book. Here's just one book if you could just read this book

32:10.900 --> 32:16.980
I wrote it right back to my own book. Here's some fanfiction. I wrote about my own story. I got a message here

32:16.980 --> 32:18.980
It's your glass rules though. It's just like

32:19.420 --> 32:24.260
Here's a mess. Sometimes I think about the music the movies are making a dark tower and I make up a trailer to it in

32:24.260 --> 32:25.620
My head when I'm bored

32:25.620 --> 32:33.380
It's always set to a someone saved my life tonight by Elton John which Griffin you also probably don't understand why but like fully

32:33.380 --> 32:38.080
Think about how good of a trailer that'd be I have a message here for Rosh and it's from Margo

32:38.080 --> 32:41.840
To baller ass names Margo says to Rosh

32:41.840 --> 32:46.400
I wanted to say or rather the brothers to say thank you for the best year of my life

32:46.400 --> 32:53.160
I can't have imagined anything better. Thank you for the endless laughs including introducing me to this podcast and fun

32:53.320 --> 32:58.340
You are the best friend and boyfriend anyone can ask for happy anniversary. Love Margo

32:59.320 --> 33:02.600
That's lovely. That's lovely. You know, I love about that two things

33:02.600 --> 33:06.400
I love love in any form all forms of love are wonderful and beautiful

33:06.400 --> 33:08.400
Mm-hmm. And

33:08.600 --> 33:15.240
I also love that they're spreading their that that love is actually benefiting us actually putting money in my pocket

33:15.240 --> 33:17.280
And that's the best kind of love that there is

33:17.280 --> 33:18.720
I know I just said all love is equal

33:18.720 --> 33:24.860
But the love that helps us bump that download count is probably better than the most beautiful perfect. Yeah

33:25.480 --> 33:32.320
But anyway, happy love Rosh and Margo. We also have a message for my friend and yours Sean Foreman

33:33.160 --> 33:34.940
Sean is

33:34.940 --> 33:41.220
amazing, um, he's got a special notice from his best gal and darling treasure of a wife who is also lovely and

33:41.920 --> 33:47.720
Melanie says to Sean happy 30th bidet to the handsomest most your suit husband a girl could ask for

33:47.880 --> 33:55.640
May all your days be filled with frolicking silvy dogs your nights danker than danky Kang and your thoughts as deep as Chicago style pizza

33:55.820 --> 34:02.180
The brothers and I raise our glasses of power to you good sir. Cheers your sweet sweet loving woman

34:02.180 --> 34:05.980
Ah happy 30th Sean and here's a twist

34:07.140 --> 34:11.780
Sean independently also reached out to me and would like to wish Melanie a happy anniversary

34:12.420 --> 34:19.580
So I figure I just tie those two together. It's kind of a gift to the Magi scenario, but everybody gets something

34:20.020 --> 34:25.460
Yeah, so they're not like the gift of the Magi at all the gift of the Magi to this time for sure

34:25.460 --> 34:27.620
But that's just called presence

34:27.620 --> 34:32.940
It's not a gift. It doesn't deserve. It's not it's not part of that parable

34:32.940 --> 34:35.860
It's just I gave you a present in the second one

34:35.900 --> 34:42.940
He gets her he buys her a hair dryer and she's like and she got him like an iPad and she's like, what are you doing?

34:42.940 --> 34:46.260
Just give me something. You know, you fuck this up so bad the last night

34:46.260 --> 34:51.940
Just give me something completely unrelated to the thing that I obviously know I am bald. You know, I'm bald

34:52.380 --> 34:55.880
It's ridiculous mark. It's ridiculous

34:55.880 --> 34:58.840
especially when I told you what I wanted I

34:59.600 --> 35:05.680
Wanted a tennis bracelet a tennis tennis bracelet. I didn't chop off my hands to get you this iPad

35:05.760 --> 35:11.160
Get me a fucking tennis. I don't have wrists anymore. It's just elbows straight to my hands

35:11.760 --> 35:13.760
Like some sort of turkey woman

35:17.020 --> 35:20.360
Well, here we are quick press conference time

35:20.360 --> 35:27.720
Fuck fuck every week on D live from the McElroy brothers studios where in we in beautiful Burbank

35:27.800 --> 35:32.920
If it was live, then we would have had this shit dead to rights on tape, but then we lost you

35:33.160 --> 35:37.240
Did you okay friends beloved friends? Did you yesterday feel a?

35:39.120 --> 35:46.640
Disturbance in the comedy energy. Did you feel a great shuddering of bits of good of precious?

35:46.640 --> 35:50.620
Finite goofs being lost to the ether

35:50.620 --> 35:56.120
I picture it like a minority report when the three people in the pool like sense of murder coming

35:56.300 --> 36:00.100
We're just suddenly everybody starts shaking and going the jokes are dying

36:00.820 --> 36:06.640
Yeah, every every listener of a bim-bam a red ball appeared on their doorstep and when they picked it up and looked at it

36:06.640 --> 36:11.620
It just said some dick jokes because they got killed and we lost them to that

36:11.620 --> 36:18.180
Justin's recording of the second half of the podcast got this one. This was not on me for a change

36:18.180 --> 36:22.700
This is definitely on audacity and Teresa asked me this morning. She's like, how does that happen?

36:22.700 --> 36:29.100
Am I responsible as he will here's about the thing about computers. I don't know he literally it's it's inexplicit

36:29.100 --> 36:32.940
If you're a data expert, he the end of the podcast was fine for him

36:32.940 --> 36:35.580
The beginning the podcast was fine for him, which you just heard

36:35.580 --> 36:39.380
You just heard the first half of our original recording and now here we are

36:39.380 --> 36:43.980
Back again, cuz he lost like eight minutes in there somewhere and shit sucked

36:45.220 --> 36:47.220
Shit sucked everyone

36:47.880 --> 36:51.300
Okay. Well, I guess let's do it again. One more again

36:52.860 --> 37:00.060
Same goofs again. Well, not the same goose different goose, but no I'm doing the same goose. I'm not writing more material

37:00.060 --> 37:03.220
I write on my material that tell you guys that I didn't know that

37:03.220 --> 37:10.140
What question did we do last time that got lost to the ether the note on the desk? See you bad one

37:10.380 --> 37:16.380
Let me tell you all how it went last time. That wasn't gold. It was all of us got really indignantly angry at this one

37:16.380 --> 37:23.540
It's angry. Yeah, so let's see how we react this time. Okay last time it was indignant anger and then this time who knows?

37:23.540 --> 37:29.500
It could be joyous joyous laughter love and acceptance. Don't cry for that show that shows gone. I should never exist

37:29.500 --> 37:34.900
This is the new that's an alternate timeline. Yeah, absolutely. Maybe your life would have been changed by that

37:34.900 --> 37:36.900
I have no idea you have to deal with this

37:37.060 --> 37:42.540
One of my co-workers just transferred to a different office. See you didn't say transferred last time

37:42.540 --> 37:44.540
So it's already really super different

37:45.660 --> 37:49.460
The day after he left I found a note on my desk from him saying how he was

37:49.700 --> 37:55.500
Always too tongue-tied around me to say anything, but he thinks that I'm beautiful and wish you could have gotten to know me better

37:55.500 --> 38:00.460
I'm not interested in him romantically, but I do think he's a nice guy and appreciate the guts

38:00.460 --> 38:02.460
It took to even leave the note read

38:02.940 --> 38:07.300
None, I want to thank him. That's my editorial ization

38:07.300 --> 38:13.540
I want to thank him for the compliment, but it will it sound at all sincere when it's followed by but I'm just not interested

38:14.220 --> 38:20.020
Yeah, would it be better if I said nothing at all? That's from secretly admired in st. Louis good news

38:20.940 --> 38:22.940
I'm still angry. Yeah

38:22.940 --> 38:27.680
It sucks me too. If anything, I'm more angry for I have not had my breakfast

38:28.380 --> 38:30.380
it's just like

38:30.580 --> 38:35.260
It's let's get let's cut to the quick. Let's not beat it. There was a lot of bush beating last time

38:35.260 --> 38:37.060
We talked about it for an hour and a half yesterday

38:37.060 --> 38:43.140
I wrote about that in my diary at night my post-show diary felt like there was a lot of bush beating

38:43.140 --> 38:45.380
Hope recording gets eaten by Jesus

38:46.940 --> 38:49.000
Well here you'd like another shot

38:49.000 --> 38:54.480
The fed it's this shouldn't be on you. This sucks. It's like it's it is the

38:55.800 --> 38:58.200
It's such a weird way to go about

38:58.680 --> 39:03.920
This like it's that you say that it took guts to leave the note and maybe that's true to a small amount

39:03.920 --> 39:07.500
But it would have taken it took significantly less guts

39:07.720 --> 39:11.140
They're just like walking up to you and talking to you in the first place

39:11.140 --> 39:16.920
And if this was like a Jim Pam situation where you guys were like fast friends and you actually talked and hung out and stuff

39:16.920 --> 39:20.960
That would be cool, but this is just like a weird mash note from somebody who like

39:21.760 --> 39:26.200
Like literally didn't give you the time of day until it was time for him to bounce then he's like hey by the way

39:26.200 --> 39:29.320
I always thought you're a pretty boy, and then a ripcord pulled him out the window

39:32.440 --> 39:40.040
What you have to do your responsibility in this situation he's nothing yeah because like you know all you this is this is as far

39:40.040 --> 39:44.600
As you need to go unfold note read. Oh, that's nice garbage garbage

39:44.600 --> 39:47.400
a little giant blunt because if

39:47.920 --> 39:54.340
Basically what this person has tried to do whether they realize it or not is say I'm gonna put the onus on you to make

39:54.440 --> 39:58.660
Contact cuz I'm a chicken shit. That's absolutely true. This is where like

39:59.640 --> 40:06.780
Infinity romantic comedies have ruined people's perception of how the shit works because this guy is expecting you'll read the note and be like really

40:07.400 --> 40:09.400
Devin you

40:09.400 --> 40:17.040
Same Devin yeah, she'll like jump out like run through the rain to like the other office across town like please don't do this

40:17.360 --> 40:19.360
I've always loved you too from afar

40:20.440 --> 40:25.640
But now you just chase him through the rain and be like thank you, but I am NOT interested in you romantically

40:26.640 --> 40:32.280
Want that dick here is an umbrella. I am NOT interested in that dick, but do take this umbrella

40:32.280 --> 40:34.280
We've got to keep that dick dry here

40:34.280 --> 40:39.720
That's the way this works in the real world how it should work is you look across the office you see

40:40.080 --> 40:45.460
Susan like first time and you're like oh, she's cute, and you walk over and you say hey

40:45.460 --> 40:48.560
I'm Devin is this your first day of the office. Yeah, it's great

40:48.760 --> 40:52.920
Do you want to like grab a drink after work, and I can tell you all about how things don't do that

40:52.920 --> 40:58.640
No, don't do that off the jump. Maybe not first day, but like if you like her ask her out your co-workers

40:58.640 --> 41:00.640
So that might be a leave

41:00.640 --> 41:05.960
Oh, God, we didn't even see it's good. We should take a second pass at every question because we don't get to that erudite

41:05.960 --> 41:12.120
Nug until our second go-around what if it's like illegal? What if the HR rep is like that's what makes it?

41:12.480 --> 41:18.340
Sexy I'm fair. That's what makes it sexy right? I do think that that would have been noted in the question

41:18.920 --> 41:24.760
Hey, I've been the case. Hey, did y'all just kiss no Thomas. We didn't you guys stink like kissing

41:24.760 --> 41:26.760
I

41:27.640 --> 41:31.800
Smell kiss juice all over you. There's kiss juice all right. Hey listen

41:32.440 --> 41:39.640
Mother slappers. I just went in the bathroom. It's some reeks of kisses in there. Yeah, I will say something did occur to me

41:39.880 --> 41:41.480
Yes

41:41.480 --> 41:45.280
Upon this second attempt that did not occur to yesterday. She says

41:46.480 --> 41:49.960
You know what I shouldn't gender her. I don't I don't know a

41:50.440 --> 41:53.280
man woman where this question asker says

41:53.280 --> 41:55.280
I

41:56.400 --> 42:01.280
Think that he's a nice guy, and I appreciate that although he does say beautiful

42:01.280 --> 42:05.840
Which we cut it would be kind of an eyes a beautiful David Bowie's a beautiful man fair enough. Yeah

42:05.840 --> 42:11.820
I do think he's a nice guy to appreciate the guts it took to leave the note, but I'm not interested in romantically

42:12.280 --> 42:14.640
We yesterday chastised the note-leaver

42:14.800 --> 42:22.560
But it sounds like they kind of nailed it like it sounds like they did have a correct read on these

42:22.560 --> 42:26.920
Situation as it stands like I do need to get this off my chest

42:26.920 --> 42:30.320
And I do recognize that this is not a thing that is happening

42:30.320 --> 42:36.480
So I'm doing this due diligence right just get this out into the universe because like my read on the situation

42:36.480 --> 42:43.240
Which it as it turns out is 100% of the money is that you do not desire a further relationship with me

42:43.240 --> 42:45.240
Oh, so he's a precog

42:45.440 --> 42:48.840
I'm saying there's a lot of pre-cognitive shit going, but no Justin

42:48.840 --> 42:52.760
It's a self-fulfilling love just be so much easier matters of the heart be so much easier

42:53.080 --> 42:55.320
There were little red and brown balls telling you

42:55.320 --> 43:01.200
But the problem is is this is a self-fulfilling precog because basically what he did was he made himself like

43:01.440 --> 43:04.480
She wants a dude or they want everybody

43:04.760 --> 43:11.040
Everybody wants someone who's willing to like put at least enough skin in the game for me fight for me

43:11.040 --> 43:13.040
Devin say words out loud

43:13.040 --> 43:19.640
Say what don't be a paper warrior fucking say words out loud to make things happen because those are the kinds of people that

43:19.640 --> 43:24.000
Go you know what sure you risked a little bit. I'm willing to see how this goes

43:24.320 --> 43:31.200
You gotta risk it for the biscuit exactly you don't get that biscuit for being a paper warrior

43:31.200 --> 43:35.360
He's trying to get a biscuit risk-free, and that's good. It's gonna be

43:36.120 --> 43:37.840
It's gonna be too

43:37.840 --> 43:42.220
Hard it's gonna be a two-day old biscuits can be crunchy and unpleasant. This is what you do

43:42.220 --> 43:47.400
This is the time you use that note you run a note that says look up and they look up and you're standing there

43:47.400 --> 43:52.200
And you say hey, that's okay a little creepy, but at least like if that's your intro

43:52.200 --> 43:55.000
That's your plan go for it, but this like I'm a ghost

43:55.000 --> 44:00.680
I left the office and now only now in my will do you find out I like you like here's the way to go

44:01.200 --> 44:07.600
Here's the reason that you should not respond to this because if you respond to it and say hey listen um

44:07.600 --> 44:08.960
I think you're a nice guy

44:08.960 --> 44:13.600
This is a really brave gesture, but I'm just not that interested then this guy

44:13.600 --> 44:19.560
What this guy like will learn from this is like I was a good approach wasn't the right person

44:19.560 --> 44:21.560
But maybe next time when I transfer offices

44:21.560 --> 44:26.480
There'll be somebody here where that seed will find purchase and he'll post on the message boards

44:26.480 --> 44:31.160
And be like it almost worked this time fellas next listen colleagues. No risk required

44:31.680 --> 44:37.800
It's a biscuit. It's a biscuit parade out there. How go nuts just reach out your hands and run run through the streets

44:37.800 --> 44:39.800
Grab as many biscuits as you can take

44:40.320 --> 44:46.400
It's just insane. I'm just irritated because this is this is a person who is

44:47.280 --> 44:52.800
Generating their own missed connection. They're like this isn't a missed connection. You were there every day

44:52.880 --> 44:55.040
Yeah, like they were there every day just

44:56.320 --> 44:58.440
Just risk it yeah, and then

44:59.160 --> 45:00.520
perhaps

45:00.520 --> 45:05.600
People people don't people think that they just because they risk it they're guaranteed a biscuit. That's inaccurate no no no no

45:05.600 --> 45:07.520
It's not a biscuit

45:07.520 --> 45:12.960
What there's no guaranteed biscuit right? That's right. It's a you you all non riskers

45:12.960 --> 45:16.800
Don't get biscuits, but y'all not all riskers get biscuits, and that's

45:17.960 --> 45:24.480
Just how the biscuit does how a cookie crumbles a biscuit and harbor is safe and a biscuit on the water gets soggy

45:24.600 --> 45:27.400
But sometimes you want to soggy, but I lost the thread

45:28.160 --> 45:31.560
It looks so to see water that would be fucking disgusting

45:31.560 --> 45:36.880
We're not saying that this is easy like it's obviously not easy like if I wasn't

45:37.120 --> 45:40.040
Happily married right now, and I had to be in this game again

45:40.040 --> 45:45.800
I would be this might be me like and and back back in my 20. Oh, it was me

45:45.800 --> 45:50.480
I was this dude. I was note guy and like I made you I burned you a CD

45:50.480 --> 45:54.320
Oh, what's that in the liners? It's a confession of my love. I'm gone though

45:54.320 --> 45:58.040
So hopefully we'll run into each other tomorrow, and you could tell me you liked it

45:58.040 --> 46:04.240
Bye like Travis James hole-in-the-wall this has nothing to do with like any sort of like

46:05.720 --> 46:11.920
Alpha male friend zone garbage like we're not like it's not it's not that like I'm just the nice guy in the corner

46:11.920 --> 46:15.840
She does her like I'm not talking about that like that. That's that's a whole other weird

46:16.880 --> 46:20.320
Subset of this question what I'm talking about is just having basic human

46:21.240 --> 46:23.880
Communication skills, and I know it's intimidating and like right now

46:23.880 --> 46:28.720
There's probably some of you on the phone like hey, this is really insensitive to those of us who can't do

46:29.240 --> 46:35.840
Do you can't today you can tomorrow maybe and that's you know that horse ride risk that biscuit a lot of that like nice guy

46:36.000 --> 46:39.200
Friendship move friend zone bullshit comes from stuff like this

46:39.280 --> 46:44.240
We're like if you're not and I'm sorry to like put you know put baby in a corner and call people out

46:44.240 --> 46:49.120
But like if you're not willing to risk it for the biscuit like how do you expect them to be like okay?

46:49.120 --> 46:54.160
Well, I guess I'm willing to do the work and reach out to you now like what?

46:54.160 --> 46:58.900
What do you think you're putting forth in a letter that says I was too scared to talk to you?

46:58.900 --> 47:01.200
But we should totally date now like that

47:02.240 --> 47:08.280
That's not a good look. What is the future that relationship look like okay, madam? That sounds like a fine order and sir

47:08.280 --> 47:13.560
What will you have oh, you're you're standing up from the table. You're leaving a note. You're walking away

47:14.440 --> 47:18.760
From the table. I'm sorry. He does this every time he wants a chain barbach on you

47:18.760 --> 47:23.160
You don't have to read the stupid note. That's what I'm saying like it is people will respect

47:23.480 --> 47:27.320
Even if they don't want to go out on a date with you even if they're not interested in you

47:27.320 --> 47:31.240
they'll at least respect that in this day and age of texting and like

47:31.800 --> 47:37.520
Messaging and fucking note leavers that if you're like hey, this is me a human being standing in front of you

47:37.520 --> 47:41.520
I would like to ask you on a date. No okay great. Thanks so much. Talk to you later. Bye

47:41.520 --> 47:49.040
I don't even have a problem with the note if it's like if you're still at the office if you're like literally like I get

47:49.040 --> 47:50.880
Really tongue-tied whenever I try to talk to you

47:50.880 --> 47:53.820
And I just wanted to try to say to you like hey

47:54.320 --> 47:57.440
I'd like to go out sometime and maybe get to know you get a bit more comfortable

47:57.440 --> 48:03.740
I'm fine with even that own your shit like if your shit is that you can't let you you do get tongue-tied these situations

48:03.740 --> 48:09.560
Like own it own it. Just don't like leave a note and then parachute out. It's insane

48:09.560 --> 48:16.240
Nothing will come of that. Hey, you make something over that you were perpetuating this insane strategy to relationships

48:16.240 --> 48:18.440
It worked for that lady in love actually

48:19.080 --> 48:25.880
She left a note, and she's like if I can't say it at Christmas when I can I say it. I'm yours David

48:26.680 --> 48:32.460
And now let me take you on a tour through your past long past your past even

48:32.460 --> 48:39.100
My side of house rule is number one. I love you. I

48:39.100 --> 48:41.900
Don't know why Griffin was doing Michael Caine is the British woman

48:41.900 --> 48:47.500
That's the only so my British woman accent is just a higher an upscale of Michael Caine

48:48.340 --> 48:51.860
Do you guys want a yahoo? Yes, please? I just want to put a button that real quick

48:51.860 --> 48:57.800
We're not chastising anybody everybody's got their shit. God knows I have mine when it comes to like social situations

48:57.800 --> 49:03.780
We're trying to inspire you don't don't live life. Oh, it's not it's not chastising

49:03.780 --> 49:07.360
It's like it's it's the truth and what sucks is that if you if you do

49:08.080 --> 49:11.000
Stuff like this where it's like I left a note, and they didn't answer

49:11.000 --> 49:15.400
It's just gonna make it harder for you like you're just gonna be like a little this fucking nothing works

49:15.400 --> 49:20.480
Nothing works because you try to think that can't work. You know what I mean, and what it is is it's this actualization

49:20.480 --> 49:25.480
It's this like you're you tell yourself that it's a romantic gesture when really what it is is you?

49:25.480 --> 49:30.280
Tried to find like the easiest low it like least scary thing

49:30.880 --> 49:35.240
That's not a romantic gesture if like you waited until you weren't around

49:35.640 --> 49:38.680
Left a note that they didn't have to respond to to your face

49:38.680 --> 49:45.440
That's not a romantic gesture is I did something risky, and it didn't work or did work, and I got me that

49:45.920 --> 49:48.240
Disky, that's a romantic gesture

49:48.240 --> 49:55.240
So don't just just make sure you're not convincing yourself that you're doing something romantic when really you're just looking for an easy

49:55.240 --> 50:00.480
Out and hoping they'll do all the work as long as we're playing buttons and things I do want to stress

50:00.880 --> 50:05.600
That this whole time. I've not been referring to women as biscuits

50:06.200 --> 50:13.880
No, that that much is clear right because I don't want people to think that I'm some sort of weird like misogynist that doesn't like

50:14.980 --> 50:20.840
Get it like I'm a misogynist who's just like trying to get things going like hey guys. What if we called all women biscuits, right?

50:20.840 --> 50:27.460
I know you're talking about more of like the ephemeral metaphorical eternal biscuit a desirable thing

50:27.560 --> 50:33.800
Yes, which for which ironically enough for me is a biscuit. No. I would I could go for a biscuit right now

50:33.800 --> 50:38.820
I crush a biscuit. I would ruin a biscuit right now. I would come and you got a yahoo. I would devastate a biscuit

50:40.280 --> 50:45.000
Yeah, I would ruin a bit that biscuit wouldn't be able to look me in the eye afterwards

50:45.120 --> 50:49.880
Here's a yahoo that was sent in by game recognized game Rachel Sperling. Thank you Rachel

50:49.880 --> 50:52.360
It's by yahoo answers user Debbie who asks

50:53.400 --> 50:57.880
Can I bring frozen pizzas in my carry-on or hold in hand?

50:59.000 --> 51:00.360
wait

51:00.360 --> 51:04.960
Is okay is this is this is the question is the question?

51:05.880 --> 51:12.500
like can I bring frozen Pete like pizzas that are still frozen right or can I

51:13.320 --> 51:18.000
Prepare a frozen pizza as a mid-flight snack and bring it upon the plane with me

51:18.000 --> 51:20.040
Cuz this is not this form

51:20.040 --> 51:24.540
But it is a question that I've often asked of like is it cool to bring this hamburger that I bought in the airport on

51:24.540 --> 51:27.200
The plane with me like you bought in the airport. Yes

51:27.200 --> 51:27.720
It's fair game

51:27.720 --> 51:31.480
If you made the hamburger at home and then you brought it or worse yet

51:31.480 --> 51:37.480
You bring with you a patty and some iceberg lettuce and some tomatoes individually in their own three three ounce bags

51:37.480 --> 51:42.480
And then you assemble it on the plane and do a little bit of prep work there and do a little bit of BAM

51:42.480 --> 51:47.960
Kick it up a notch there. Well, hold on spicy rub that you know, what if you take it to a full show, right?

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
And you're like Benihana

51:48.960 --> 51:54.800
In it up over there is you're like flipping the tomato in the air and catching it on the burger and everyone around you like

51:54.800 --> 51:58.000
Oh, he's a real burger professional. Look at that burger boy

51:58.000 --> 52:01.980
I'm gonna go ahead and say that they will not allow you to bring a Japanese griddle on the plane

52:02.020 --> 52:04.020
That's a draft. Did you look I?

52:05.040 --> 52:06.680
Can check the TSA guidelines

52:06.680 --> 52:12.240
But I'm pretty sure Japanese griddles are like number one on their things cuz like you put that in the hands

52:12.240 --> 52:17.960
Of a of a splinter agent and I don't want to I don't want to be down wolf

52:17.960 --> 52:22.780
I don't want to be dour, but you put it put it in the hands of somebody with something to prove

52:26.560 --> 52:33.480
You know you you we all know the regulations about liquor when you're going on a flight and we've learned to build our lives around

52:33.480 --> 52:35.760
Those small bottles that we can carry with us on planes

52:35.800 --> 52:40.840
but what we have what I don't think has been addressed fully by TSA guidelines when I'd be interested in testing is

52:40.840 --> 52:43.440
Could you just bring a pizza like?

52:44.280 --> 52:49.120
Obviously you're not buying a frozen pizza in the airport. That's insane. That doesn't happen

52:49.120 --> 52:52.800
I've never even seen a freezer in an airport so like obviously you're not doing that

52:52.920 --> 52:59.640
So this person is saying they're going to just have a they're gonna have their suitcase. They're gonna have their carry-on bag

52:59.840 --> 53:01.840
they're going to have a

53:02.280 --> 53:09.360
Tombstone just a fully frozen like ready-to-cook tombstone. Yeah, is that getting through the TSA?

53:09.360 --> 53:14.200
Justin, are you talking about like just going and like grabbing a hot and ready and like going through security?

53:14.720 --> 53:20.520
Yes, I can't see why they would stop you. They can't stop you right. This is a great

53:20.520 --> 53:26.720
This is a great this brings up another great question and this question is really splintering off into a beautiful question tree

53:26.840 --> 53:29.400
But if I take my proactive

53:29.400 --> 53:35.520
Which is a three-step topical application that I use to fight my battle against bad skin every day of my life

53:35.520 --> 53:41.440
But Griffin you have great skin. I know it's the proactive anymore on that same tip

53:42.080 --> 53:46.080
If I freeze that shit, can I bring as much as I want?

53:47.280 --> 53:52.160
If I if I freeze it in a giant ice cube, and then I bring it on

53:53.240 --> 53:54.680
a sled

53:54.680 --> 53:59.040
What if it's an extra saucy pizza and after it defrosts you?

53:59.040 --> 54:05.300
You bring it out in the bathroom, and you squeeze out four ounces of marinara like good job. I guess

54:06.920 --> 54:12.560
Really you really skirted our nation's security for sure, but then they would update it wouldn't they and then they'd be like no

54:13.320 --> 54:16.600
Solids over three ounces like what it's too saucy

54:20.520 --> 54:25.640
We've been very antagonistic towards this person, but is it possible they're going someplace

54:25.640 --> 54:31.840
Where where pizzas outlawed maybe they're they're a pizza outlaw like the state of Tennessee like the state

54:32.400 --> 54:38.060
Is outlawed and only outlaws have pizza only outlaws have pizza

54:38.060 --> 54:42.840
They never talk about that, but that's fact if you outlaw pizza only outlaws will have pizza

54:43.160 --> 54:46.880
That's a good point our war on pizza has been a colossal failure

54:47.840 --> 54:51.840
Yeah, the streets now than there was in 1998 when we began

54:51.840 --> 54:57.680
I don't even know what Tennessee's trying to achieve with that law if your pizza if you're bringing your pizza either on your carry-on

54:57.680 --> 55:02.940
Or just literally holding it in your hand that is not good smuggling technique

55:03.000 --> 55:05.280
No, but Griffin you're getting it all wrong

55:05.280 --> 55:12.420
It's so it's it's so blatant that there's no way they'll suspect you like the TSA agents would be like well

55:12.760 --> 55:18.680
He wouldn't he wouldn't just carry the pizza on the plate. He's got to have like shirts folded up in that box, right?

55:18.680 --> 55:22.800
Like yeah, well yeah, I mean yes Travis except when you touch down in Chattanooga

55:22.800 --> 55:26.760
You better believe the pizza police are gonna be on you like

55:27.280 --> 55:33.080
Instantly you better be smuggling it in your tummy cuz that's a solid like three hour flight for me

55:33.120 --> 55:37.840
Like I don't know that scanner that you go through where they put make you put your arms up like you're doing the YMCA

55:38.320 --> 55:44.440
That will detect pizza in your tummy and listen all want to walk around Rock City munching on some pizza

55:44.440 --> 55:50.120
We all want to do that, but you know what sometimes the law is the law and it's not okay to eat pizza in Tennessee

55:50.120 --> 55:55.120
And I get that even though Rock City is the perfect place to consume pizza. We all know that

55:55.120 --> 55:58.680
It's in the guidebooks from pre 1998 before pizza was outlawed

55:58.680 --> 56:02.760
But unfortunately the the governor just won't allow you to have pizza in Tennessee

56:02.760 --> 56:06.880
And that's fact look it up the most you know the most annoying part about the pizza band

56:06.880 --> 56:11.120
Is that you could still totally get pizza when you're in when you're in?

56:11.120 --> 56:17.120
Tennessee you just like you just have to know like the right places to go there are these doors you knock on them

56:17.120 --> 56:19.920
And there's like a secret pizza club. They call them speak Cheezys

56:19.920 --> 56:26.640
And you just go in and you and you can get that pizza like like prohibited pizza. No problem any topic

56:26.640 --> 56:30.080
There's just like a guy like named Jimmy knuckles at the pizza bar

56:31.800 --> 56:35.760
When you do that you know you're just contributing to like the organized

56:35.760 --> 56:42.400
You know pizza families and like alco calzone, and you're just like giving money back to the evil right

56:42.400 --> 56:44.640
That's why I see is going down the tubes

56:45.200 --> 56:48.480
Calzone is how he got it in we just folded them over

56:49.440 --> 56:52.560
Let me see that sandwich. It looks like you got cheese sauce and meat in there

56:52.920 --> 56:59.120
No, it's a calzone office. We just unfold the calzones. They're all just going to get a calzone loophole

56:59.120 --> 57:06.760
Oh, yeah, no don't take it to be so great I Kyle Canaan has a great bit on his album where he talks about like

57:06.760 --> 57:08.200
Then he was flying next to this dude

57:08.200 --> 57:13.760
He brought just like a plastic bag full of waffles and syrup just like loose waffles and syrup

57:13.760 --> 57:15.280
And it's like eating them out of the bag

57:15.280 --> 57:18.320
And that's what this sounds like to me like you're gonna take a frozen pizza

57:18.320 --> 57:24.240
Which I think is pre-cooked allow it to thaw throughout the flight so like as you're like doing the descent

57:24.240 --> 57:27.400
You're just munching on some soggy defrosted pizza. I

57:27.400 --> 57:30.860
I once sat next to a woman who had a tub

57:31.400 --> 57:34.200
This is this is I swear. This is true Rachel is with me

57:34.200 --> 57:40.800
We were flying next to this woman who had a tub a country crock tub only there was not country crock inside the tub

57:40.800 --> 57:46.920
It was some sort of crazy tuna salad and she was dipping some wheat thins into it

57:48.520 --> 57:50.520
This was the flight before

57:50.520 --> 57:55.040
Through security. Yeah, this was our flight before our flight to Japan

57:55.040 --> 58:00.240
And I was like if I if it was the flight to Japan I would have called the air marshal

58:00.240 --> 58:07.000
I would have literally ripped open the the emergency exit and kicked this woman out of the plane con air style

58:07.360 --> 58:13.920
Because there's that's and that's like a 10-hour flight, and I'm not gonna have an intercontinental tuna fish adventure

58:13.920 --> 58:19.080
You kick that tuna fish idiot out of the plane. You just look at everybody else and like no ticket

58:19.080 --> 58:27.300
I love it and also like no ticket, but also she did have tuna fish salad and oh my god

58:27.520 --> 58:29.760
sweet god it was like tuna fish and

58:30.280 --> 58:36.840
Just a really fragrant because even if she eats every bit of it in the first hour. It's like it's a linger

58:36.840 --> 58:41.080
It's a linger. Oh, yeah, it's in the play. It's a self-contained system

58:41.080 --> 58:44.280
Yeah, there's just you're not getting additional off your recycling

58:44.280 --> 58:50.240
Just air for nine hours while everybody watches Twilight new moon on the back of their seats. You're like that

58:50.240 --> 58:55.120
It's like that one restaurant in the airport that only serves the stinkiest salads

58:55.120 --> 58:59.320
And I don't know where it is, but some people do because they're bringing them on the plane

58:59.600 --> 59:05.520
This is a this flight is going to be on an American Airlines stink bullet 727

59:06.480 --> 59:13.080
It's a it captures and contains stink and we have installed special fans to really circulate it

59:13.080 --> 59:17.360
so if any person on the plane is eating, I don't know some some sort of

Don't want to like have like two pairs that you're washing and wearing every two days. You'll wear them out

Sold out. I'm sorry

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.520
We had a few tickets go up or last week and the venue didn't put them up when when we thought they were going to

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.960
And so there was a whole kerfuffle

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.520
We are we're really sorry if you tried to get tickets for that and couldn't because of the delay

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.440

We're making the drive also Portland

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.200
I don't want to encourage too many people to do this because there's no guarantee on this

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.020
But you could always try like standby and hope that like people bought tickets

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.220
But don't show up that happens from time to time

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.320
So you can come down to the venue night of and try to get on a standby list

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.840
But once again, yeah, there's no guarantee that no guarantee Seattle and Vancouver here is a guarantee though

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.060
