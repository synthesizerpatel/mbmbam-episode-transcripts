00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.360
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother being an advice show

00:47.360 --> 00:51.520
for the modern era. It's Star Wars Watch 2014. I'm Justin McElroy,

00:51.520 --> 00:57.120
your oldest brother and most seasoned Jedi master.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.480
I'm Travis McElroy, your most midichlorian brother.

01:00.480 --> 01:07.760
And I'm Baby Greedo. Look at me go, doing some crime. Everybody hop in on my spaceship.

01:09.760 --> 01:15.760
I think the bit- Griffin's already touched on it, but we all have just watched the Star Wars

01:16.640 --> 01:22.720
trailer, the teaser trailer, and I think the biggest surprise is the baby versions

01:22.720 --> 01:24.640
of so many of the characters. Yeah.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.560
So many characters are baby versions. Which is weird, because it's not a prequel,

01:28.560 --> 01:34.320
is it? But Griffin, is it weird? Because if you think about it, it is related to the Henson

01:34.320 --> 01:36.640
Studios, the Muppets. That's a good point.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.400
Muppet babies, Star Wars babies. Shit, shit, shit. And also,

01:40.400 --> 01:43.440
Rodians age in reverse. Exactly.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.440
Did I ever tell you the story about when I was showing off to my then-girlfriend,

01:47.440 --> 01:51.600
who would later become my wife, Rachel, about all my Star Wars knowledge.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.080
And I was telling her all about Trandoshans and Wookiee Bowcasters.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.080
And then she asked me when her birthday was, and I got it. I was off by a day.

02:00.080 --> 02:06.400
I got that one wrong. I'm a pile of garbage.

02:08.480 --> 02:12.880
That's the other big surprise. That big pile of garbage, the sentient pile of garbage

02:13.920 --> 02:20.080
from the trailer was something that really surprised me. Grimsham, the living pile of

02:20.080 --> 02:24.160
garbage. I was surprised that they brought back Pete to the hut, because he ate himself

02:24.160 --> 02:29.760
in the last movie. They're going to have to do some nifty storytelling acrobatics to get

02:29.760 --> 02:34.560
themselves on this one. I did enjoy the cameo by Barf.

02:34.560 --> 02:39.440
It's all holograms, I'm assuming. Oh, Justin, thanks for reminding us.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.040
Oh, sorry. If you are not living with the fact of John Candy's demise every day in your heart,

02:45.040 --> 02:48.080
then I don't think you're a true fan. I don't think you're a candy head.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.680
I was surprised to find out that part of the movie would be taking place on Earth in the

02:51.680 --> 02:57.440
present. That was weird. The whales are fine, guys. You don't need to save them again.

02:57.440 --> 03:08.160
I didn't get the part where Ron Solo, which is Han Solo's brother, went down on a lightsaber.

03:09.120 --> 03:14.720
Did anybody else get that part? There was a 45-second stretch there in the trailer where

03:14.720 --> 03:21.120
it's just like, and he just partied on it. It's weird because you think about it,

03:21.120 --> 03:26.880
and it's a hot light laser, and that would kill him, but it didn't seem to have any effect.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.360
I feel like they're just fucking playing Calvin Ball with their lightsabers now.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.280
They're just making shit up now. They're just putting lightsabers on everything.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.720
Just give me the one. I'm still blown away. Every time I see just the one come out, I'm like,

03:44.880 --> 03:49.840
whoa. I don't need seven on one boy. I don't need it on a keychain. That's what I keep waiting for,

03:49.840 --> 03:57.360
is a lightsaber keychain. It is real. I wish that they in maglites or in Star Wars,

03:57.360 --> 04:01.280
they had the big lightsabers, and then they had the little lightsabers for just the tiny jobs.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.120
We're joking, but you know that's going to be in the next trailer.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.880
You have a light dagger? Yeah, I think he's the most evil Jedi that

04:08.880 --> 04:13.040
ever lived, and then he pulls out a giant lightsaber, and the beam is like

04:13.040 --> 04:17.680
the size of a bus, and he's like, fucking what's up now? I'm going to win every sword fight because

04:17.680 --> 04:21.200
I've got a bus saber. Fuck this. And it weighs nothing because it's light.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.640
We're all just making shit up now, so guess what? My lightsaber is a planet. Oh, I win the fight.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.400
Why can't they have a lightsaber that's like a football field long? He just sweeps it around

04:32.400 --> 04:35.120
and kills everybody. As long as we're able to run into it.

04:35.120 --> 04:39.680
As long as we're making shit up, why does baby Greedo even have a lightsaber?

04:40.400 --> 04:44.240
Rodians can't have midi-chlorians. I don't want to be racist, but Rodians can't have

04:44.240 --> 04:47.920
midi-chlorians. It's bullshit. You have to be careful about making sweeping

04:47.920 --> 04:52.320
statements like that, I found, because no matter what sort of bullshit you want to rule out,

04:52.320 --> 04:56.480
someone will come to you and say, actually, in the extended fiction, there's been several

04:56.480 --> 05:03.280
instances of Greedo and- Fuck that. Bug-faced little monsters. They don't get lightsabers.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.000
Trandoshans neither. Again, I hate to cast aspersions.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.120
Can you only use a lightsaber if you can wield the force?

05:11.120 --> 05:17.360
I think so. Although, I'm sure there's some EU shit for that too. I mean, Ron Solo can use it,

05:17.360 --> 05:22.880
and he's not a force user, but I would say he's using it wrong. Decidedly wrong. He's not using

05:22.880 --> 05:28.960
it to battle the Sith. He's using it to practice his gag reflex suppression.

05:28.960 --> 05:33.520
Griffin, I saw on Twitter that you wanted to speak up about vibroblades. Did you have

05:33.520 --> 05:36.400
something to add there? Is there something you wanted to say about vibroblades?

05:36.400 --> 05:41.600
I'm just saying they're super tight, and that they are more realistic, I think,

05:41.600 --> 05:45.840
arguably, than lightsabers are, and it's just a part of the fiction that we haven't fucking

05:45.840 --> 05:50.240
completely explored. Put a vibroblade on that trailer, people will freak the fuck out. You

05:50.240 --> 05:54.960
don't have to keep upping your lightsaber game. Is a vibroblade just a vibrating blade,

05:54.960 --> 05:58.320
like one of those serrated turkey carvers? It's exactly like that.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.280
It's basically just that, but longer. That's badass.

06:01.280 --> 06:08.960
F for Wumpa. You use them on a Wumpa. How come nobody ever eats Wumpa?

06:08.960 --> 06:11.840
It's stupid. Actually, they extended fiction.

06:11.840 --> 06:16.240
Can we please go and do questions? There's a Wumpa chef who specializes

06:16.240 --> 06:19.120
in cooking Wumpa-related dishes. This season on Wumpa Chef.

06:20.720 --> 06:26.480
I'm Wumpa boss. Let's help people.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.600
For once. A friend of mine recently started doing stand-up

06:29.600 --> 06:33.680
comedy. Due to scheduling conflicts, I have yet to see her act. But just this week,

06:33.680 --> 06:37.520
we were joking around and she casually ripped off a bit from a stand-up special we had watched

06:37.520 --> 06:42.480
just the week before. I highly suspect she's ripping off other acts on the reg.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.720
Do I bring it up or let her dig her own grave? She's not a really good friend.

06:49.040 --> 06:54.000
Of comedic charlatanism in California. Cool, cool, cool.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.400
It sounds like neither of you are especially good friends.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
I feel like before you do anything, you have to go see her show.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.440
Go see her fucking act, of course. Yeah.

07:05.440 --> 07:10.560
And then if she starts doing like a Mitch Hedberg joke, you can see it and say like, Jacques Hughes.

07:10.560 --> 07:15.200
She gets up there and she's like, hey, I've been thinking about this for a long time,

07:15.200 --> 07:19.120
and I think that there's seven curse words. You'd be like, sit down. You're done.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.800
That would actually be really great though if you got up there and you're like,

07:22.800 --> 07:26.880
here's seven curse words. Fanny. And Fanny could be one of them.

07:30.880 --> 07:36.640
You guys may not remember this, but there was this Christian youth leader that used to make

07:36.640 --> 07:43.520
the rounds. I won't name him because I don't want to bring shame upon his house and his fine work.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.000
But this guy was like a big hit with the youth. The youth love this guy.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.880
And he would do these bits. He did a lot of comedy, a lot of comedy bits.

07:53.600 --> 08:00.960
And at one point, and this would have been like early 90s, late 80s, he started doing a

08:00.960 --> 08:07.840
here's your sign bit. Now, I have to keep in mind, this is pre Blue Collar, pre all that stuff.

08:07.840 --> 08:13.040
Bill Engvall is just a young guy that my dad had seen on like Evening at the Improv kind of stuff.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.920
And at the Apollo. Yeah.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.920
And at the Apollo, dad had seen him there. And he's in his seat like getting

08:19.920 --> 08:24.480
livid. He keeps whispering to me like, this is not his stuff.

08:24.480 --> 08:32.080
Literally, dad goes to him after he does like the prime time everybody come to Jesus.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.320
Like, come on, let's get right with the Lord thing. Dad goes up to him afterwards,

08:36.320 --> 08:40.560
afterwards, after that. He's like literally praying and crying with

08:40.560 --> 08:43.360
pregnant teens that want to get their life right with the Lord.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.000
And dad's like, hey, have you ever heard of Bill Engvall?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.440
You fuck. You fucking dipshit asshole.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.000
God knows what you do. God knows what you do.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.840
You're doing good work, but you're doing it in a bad way, you fucking creep.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.560
Bill Engvall has worked for every dollar he's earned until he makes-

09:00.560 --> 09:04.880
God gave Bill Engvall those jokes first. Then you steal them out of Bill Engvall's mouth.

09:04.880 --> 09:11.440
God came to him low like a burning bush. He was like, yo, come here, check this out.

09:11.440 --> 09:17.680
It's like they have signs, Bill. And the signs tell everybody how dumb they are, Bill.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.880
Bill, the burning bush, here's your sign.

09:24.320 --> 09:33.520
This is such a sticky wicket because she was in casual conversation with you and

09:34.960 --> 09:40.000
she, quote unquote, stole a gag. I don't think that that's the same thing as like using it in

09:40.000 --> 09:43.360
an act and passing it off. It's 100% not the same thing, Justin.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.440
It's not, right? It's definitely not.

09:45.440 --> 09:52.960
But we do this comedy show here and I don't know if you guys have ever done this.

09:52.960 --> 09:59.040
I will sometimes listen to a past episode or someone like mentioned on Twitter like, hey,

09:59.040 --> 10:03.040
you know, that's funny that this other guy did that exact joke.

10:03.040 --> 10:08.320
Like, oh my God, it had been buried in my psyche and then it reemerged

10:08.320 --> 10:13.760
purporting to be a new creation, a unique special snowflake.

10:14.480 --> 10:19.440
Yeah, you gotta go see the show and then I think afterwards, you know what, or don't.

10:20.080 --> 10:24.400
Like, maybe just don't. What do you care? What does it matter?

10:24.400 --> 10:30.400
Why would you get into that fucking awkward black cesspool of a conversation

10:30.400 --> 10:37.360
from which there can beat that oratory labrea tar pit of that conversation

10:37.360 --> 10:38.880
if you did not have to? Yeah.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.680
There is no reason for you to wade into this motherfucker.

10:41.680 --> 10:47.040
Best case scenario, there's no issue, but like every other case scenario after that

10:47.040 --> 10:50.080
is you having to say something or you knowing something and not saying something

10:50.080 --> 10:52.720
or trying to find a way to say and it's all just awful.

10:53.600 --> 11:02.720
One time I was at a comedy show here in Austin that was just like a stand up open mic thing

11:02.720 --> 11:06.960
and this dude got up there and started making all these really horrible jokes.

11:06.960 --> 11:11.600
He was talking about that driver who like crashed into a crowd at South by Southwest

11:11.600 --> 11:14.400
and killed like six people. That happened like two days before.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.560
Cool, cool, cool. Great job, dude.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.080
But then he started ripping off jokes from The Daily Show,

11:20.080 --> 11:23.840
which seems like a weird place to rip it off from because fucking everybody watches that.

11:25.760 --> 11:30.880
And he talked about the plane crash that happened and how those kids called that news station

11:30.880 --> 11:34.240
and said the pilot's name was We Too Low and like all that shit.

11:34.240 --> 11:38.400
And he just like did that as if it was his own goof. And I heard a guy in the back of the crowd

11:38.400 --> 11:44.000
just go, fuck you. And that's probably the best possible way to call somebody out on this.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.600
That's one way of dealing with it.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.600
Someone told us on Twitter that they saw a stand up comedian in Austin

11:49.600 --> 11:53.040
who had been doing some My Brother, My Brother and Me classic goofs.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.360
And then they said they saw you at a restaurant later that same night.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.880
So it was a very strange experience.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.720
I don't go to places where anyone can touch my food besides me,

12:04.720 --> 12:08.400
but I saw that tweet and I thought about which of our bits could fucking

12:08.400 --> 12:10.160
possibly translate over to-

12:10.160 --> 12:12.720
Hey, guys, ever notice how orb the horse? Am I right?

12:12.720 --> 12:16.320
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, what's up with old people gum?

12:16.320 --> 12:17.680
Peepum's nasty gum, that shit.

12:17.680 --> 12:22.720
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

12:22.720 --> 12:23.840
Dwarf? Dwarf?

12:23.840 --> 12:27.040
Anybody got a dwarf? Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

12:27.040 --> 12:27.840
Here's your sign.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.440
Fucking here's your-

12:29.440 --> 12:32.640
Horses, ghosts, where are you guys at?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.200
That's what our show sounds like to us.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.440
Rhodians don't get no lightsabers.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.600
I don't watch no races, but Rhodians don't get no lightsabers.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.880
Put that lightsaber down.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.560
Andy.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.040
That fucking classic Rhodian lightsaber dude.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.680
Fucking everyone's nipping at our heels.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.320
They're ripping off bits that we haven't even posted yet

12:54.320 --> 12:55.680
from earlier in the show.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.640
Inception.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.840
What, Frankenstein's dick? Holy shit.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.360
That was from our candlelight episode.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.080
I've become dislodged from the time stream.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.280
Frankenstein's dick.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.720
You guys want a yahoo?

13:12.720 --> 13:12.960
Yeah.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.120
Accidentally made my mom and dad break up.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.800
I'm fading away.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.080
Ghost horses.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.440
Do you guys want a yahoo?

13:21.440 --> 13:21.940
Help.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.120
Getting hard to see.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.800
This yahoo was...

13:27.600 --> 13:28.640
Translucive.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.400
This yahoo was sent in by level 44 yahoo shaman Drew Davenport.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.200
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.560
It's by yahoo answers user.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.760
They've been suspended.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.920
But when they existed, they asked,

13:41.920 --> 13:43.840
what do you think Frankenstein's dick look like?

13:50.560 --> 13:54.320
They asked, I tend to steal people's toilet paper

13:54.320 --> 13:55.520
when I go to their houses.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.760
Not really a question, but...

13:58.800 --> 14:01.120
I have tried to stop, but find that I can't.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.400
It gives me an adrenaline rush.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.480
Wait, it's not about Frankenstein's dick?

14:04.480 --> 14:05.040
No.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.120
I have tried to stop, but find that I can't.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.480
It gives me an adrenaline rush.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.880
I feel I may move on to more explicit

14:10.880 --> 14:12.960
and vast bathroom materials.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.040
What do I do to stop?

14:15.040 --> 14:17.200
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.240
This person's not getting a rush from the theft of it.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.480
They're getting a rush because it's toilet paper

14:22.480 --> 14:24.480
and therefore explicit to them.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.040
And they're saying like,

14:25.040 --> 14:27.040
I'm gonna steal dirtier and dirtier things.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.680
No, I think it's the thievery that's really doing it for them,

14:29.680 --> 14:32.800
but they're gonna move on to more explicit and vast.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.680
I don't know what that means,

14:33.680 --> 14:35.760
but I think it could probably describe

14:35.760 --> 14:38.400
the My Brother, My Brother and Me catalog at this point.

14:38.400 --> 14:38.880
Fair.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.960
Do you think they mean like I'm gonna steal like bigger?

14:40.960 --> 14:43.040
I'm gonna steal like towels and the shower curtain.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.320
No, probably like soaps and then maybe pills

14:46.320 --> 14:47.520
and then maybe tampos.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.680
See, but that's the thing.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.680
This question would be a thousand percent different

14:51.680 --> 14:52.880
if the question was,

14:52.880 --> 14:56.400
I tend to steal pills from my friend's medicine cabinets.

14:56.400 --> 14:56.960
Okay, great.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.040
Like this is an issue that I steal toilet paper

14:59.040 --> 15:00.640
and then you're just a dick.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.440
Are you?

15:01.440 --> 15:04.480
It's a victimless crime except for the victim.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.120
It is not.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.960
I know exactly how many rolls of toilet paper

15:06.960 --> 15:08.720
were in my home at all times.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.360
That's bullshit.

15:09.360 --> 15:09.840
That's not true.

15:09.840 --> 15:10.720
You know how you've heard-

15:10.720 --> 15:11.600
Three and a half.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.000
Okay.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.040
Have you ever heard that like some cultures

15:15.600 --> 15:19.360
only have words for like one, two and a whole bunch?

15:19.360 --> 15:21.920
Like they just don't have words for-

15:21.920 --> 15:23.600
Because they have no need for like numbers.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.320
So they don't have words for like higher numbers.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.800
Like in China, there's never four of something.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.360
That's what's considered bad luck.

15:31.360 --> 15:36.800
But I think that there are really only two numbers of-

15:36.800 --> 15:37.360
Well, okay.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.440
Three numbers of toilet paper you can have.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.120
You can have none.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.120
You can have one or you can have plenty.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.160
I don't even think about it.

15:48.160 --> 15:54.800
I'm like ethically bound to not buy toilet paper.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.840
I cannot see when I have two rolls of toilet paper.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.760
You don't possess the sight.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.960
I do not possess a sight to see a number of toilet paper rolls

16:02.960 --> 16:06.320
beyond one, none or plenty.

16:06.320 --> 16:10.560
Well, because of that, where do you stop hoarding toilet paper?

16:10.560 --> 16:13.600
Like at two, at three, at four, pretty soon you just have

16:13.600 --> 16:15.360
like a closet full of toilet paper.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.120
I think that that is why we as human beings

16:17.120 --> 16:19.360
can only fathom buying more toilet paper

16:19.360 --> 16:21.200
when we're down to the last roll.

16:21.200 --> 16:21.600
It's true.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.880
Right, because it's a slippery slope.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.880
Yeah, otherwise you panic and you're just like,

16:24.880 --> 16:25.600
it's on sale.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.880
Yeah, cube, cube, cube.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.080
And you just buy like cube after cube of toilet paper.

16:30.640 --> 16:31.760
We're talking in circles here.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.480
We got to get back to the heart of the matter

16:34.480 --> 16:36.960
because how is this person doing this?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.400
Are they going the full roll?

16:38.400 --> 16:40.960
If that's the case, how do they get it on their person?

16:40.960 --> 16:42.720
I was thinking about that too, logistically.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.800
Yeah, do you take it all off the roll

16:44.800 --> 16:46.160
and shove it in your pockets

16:46.160 --> 16:47.120
and then leave the house with it?

16:47.120 --> 16:48.320
Because that feels less like a crime.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.600
Maybe you've got a cold.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.640
You know what I mean?

16:50.640 --> 16:52.160
Could you wrap yourself in it

16:52.160 --> 16:54.480
and then put your clothes on over at the old under mummy?

16:54.480 --> 16:56.640
That is what I would go with.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.040
And that's good.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.320
It protects you against the elements.

16:58.880 --> 16:59.840
And bullets.

16:59.840 --> 17:00.480
And bullets.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.840
A lot of people don't know that.

17:01.840 --> 17:02.560
Isn't it amazing?

17:02.560 --> 17:05.280
I think that like toilet paper is like Time Lord technology

17:05.280 --> 17:07.200
because on the roll, it's so compact.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.400
But then when you take it off the roll,

17:08.400 --> 17:10.080
I feel like it would take up so much room.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.200
You'd have to like pretend to be pregnant

17:13.200 --> 17:13.840
and your friends would be like,

17:13.840 --> 17:15.280
you weren't pregnant when you got here, were you?

17:15.280 --> 17:16.240
I'm like, yes.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.600
Yes, I thousand percent was.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.720
I sat on a toilet seat where somebody did a naughty thing.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.360
And I got instant pregnant.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.800
I got super pregnant very fast.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.120
I think that this is fine.

17:30.000 --> 17:30.560
You think it's fine?

17:30.560 --> 17:31.920
You think it's fine?

17:31.920 --> 17:32.400
Yeah.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.200
You think it's fine?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.280
That's a pretty bold statement, Griffin.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.800
I think you'd say not the weirdest thing we've talked about.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.760
I'll give that to you.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.040
Okay, but you know what?

17:41.520 --> 17:43.280
Again, I go back to the same issue.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.920
If you stole someone's roll of toilet paper,

17:45.920 --> 17:47.440
that's a victimless crime.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.200
If you steal the last roll of toilet paper,

17:49.200 --> 17:50.480
your history is the greatest monster.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.080
But okay, yes.

17:52.080 --> 17:56.400
But how hard is it to buy toilet paper?

17:57.920 --> 17:58.400
Not hard.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.600
Where do you even find it?

18:00.720 --> 18:03.040
It's not very hard to buy toilet paper, right?

18:03.040 --> 18:03.920
And whatever.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.960
I do it all the time.

18:04.960 --> 18:05.840
I do it every day.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.240
It's a bit embarrassing when it's the only thing you buy.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.240
Yeah, I'll give you that.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.520
And then it gets more embarrassing

18:11.520 --> 18:12.720
when you buy one other thing

18:12.720 --> 18:13.440
because then you're saying,

18:13.440 --> 18:14.640
this thing's gonna make me shit.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.840
Yeah, sure.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.360
But it's suntan lotion.

18:17.360 --> 18:17.600
Yeah.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.640
Yeah, I don't know, man.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.440
We'll figure it out.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.880
Maybe I'll put it on an English muffin.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
It's not hard to buy toilet paper, right?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
But the thrill that this person gets,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.080
they don't get from anything else.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.720
So even if I knew that my friend was coming to my house

18:32.720 --> 18:34.080
and stealing my toilet paper,

18:34.080 --> 18:36.080
just knowing how happy it made them,

18:36.080 --> 18:36.880
it would be fine.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.240
As long as it didn't get more explicit and vast.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.240
I think that your friends can have a talk with you,

18:42.240 --> 18:42.960
like, keep it.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.400
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.880
I need you to stick to the TP, my friend.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.880
Pretty soon you're going to put up a sign

18:48.880 --> 18:51.280
that says like all bags must be checked at the front door.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.600
Like, I don't trust you to take your backpack

18:53.600 --> 18:54.560
into the bathroom.

18:54.560 --> 18:58.880
I think that's actually what the song Waterfalls was about.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.880
Have you guys ever done anything like this?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.440
Stolen somebody's toilet paper?

19:03.440 --> 19:06.880
Well, because I have in my younger, poorer days,

19:06.880 --> 19:10.080
I stole a roll of toilet paper from a business job type.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.480
Oh, yeah, oh, fucking, I'll rob a business blind.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.360
Forget about it.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.960
Okay, because that I do think is victimless.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.160
That giant roll.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.520
Oh, you card.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.640
Do you need a couple dollars?

19:24.400 --> 19:25.520
How tight are times?

19:28.000 --> 19:28.960
Next question.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.200
Next question.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.920
My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years.

19:33.920 --> 19:34.800
When we first started dating,

19:34.800 --> 19:37.440
we both lived in the same city as his extended family.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.200
Now we live on the other side of the country

19:39.200 --> 19:41.440
and we moved in together six months ago.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.520
Christmas is coming up soon

19:43.520 --> 19:46.560
and I want him to meet my extended family.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.280
They live about five hours from his hometown.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.320
But oh my God, this is like algebra, okay.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.520
But he says it doesn't make sense for him to go to there.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.520
He doesn't have a lot of money

19:57.520 --> 19:59.280
and won't have access to his own car to drive.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.200
I'm going to be borrowing my father's car

20:03.200 --> 20:05.920
to see him and his family on New Year's.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.000
How can I convince him that meeting my Nana

20:08.000 --> 20:10.080
is important to me without creating resentment

20:10.080 --> 20:10.880
on the other end?

20:11.920 --> 20:14.080
I wish it was originally from Ohio.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.520
Listen, just like point of order,

20:16.400 --> 20:18.080
all we needed was that last sentence

20:19.040 --> 20:20.560
because the crux of this question is

20:20.560 --> 20:23.440
how to really sell your Nana?

20:23.440 --> 20:27.760
And that's, I didn't need all that maths is all I'm saying

20:27.760 --> 20:30.240
because it got confused and I got angry.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.360
How do I make my Nana seem like the newest, hottest thing?

20:33.360 --> 20:35.040
Can you spruce up your Nana?

20:35.040 --> 20:38.400
How do you keep your Nana fresh for the 2014 season?

20:38.400 --> 20:39.600
Call the property brothers.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.280
Call the property brothers.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.280
They're going to put an I-beam in your Nana.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.640
It gives it a real rustic.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.080
Travis appreciated that property brothers joke.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.480
We gave your mother exposed beams.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.600
Listen, you broke motherfucker.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.960
You can't afford this Nana.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.480
We're going to buy you a shitty Nana

20:54.480 --> 20:55.440
and we're going to fix her up.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.160
Hey, my name is Gladys.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.680
You fucking suck.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.720
Yeah, but just check this out.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.800
And look here on her back, heated tiles.

21:04.800 --> 21:07.280
Now you would think that that would be out of your price range,

21:07.280 --> 21:09.120
but we saved it by not getting her feet.

21:10.320 --> 21:10.720
No feet.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.800
I know you want this particular granite for your Nana's countertops,

21:14.800 --> 21:17.760
but we don't think it makes sense just fiscally.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.760
So we're going to get her some cheaper stuff.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.760
We also put a skylight into this new Nana and that did kill her.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.200
That was the thing that killed her.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.640
That was on us.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.760
But the lap still works.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.560
Check out this lap.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.080
So if I'm understanding this correctly,

21:34.080 --> 21:36.880
when they moved in together, they lived in the same town.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.560
So she's met his extended family.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.360
Oh, yeah.

21:39.360 --> 21:43.280
And now they live only five hours away from her extended family.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.680
He doesn't think it makes sense.

21:46.880 --> 21:47.680
You got to do it.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.280
I mean, I know it's I kind of get where he's coming from,

21:52.080 --> 21:53.120
but it's like important.

21:53.120 --> 21:58.720
Like three years is a long time for him to not have met your family, right?

21:58.720 --> 22:00.720
Like, well, I think this is specific.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.960
Just I think this is specifically extended family

22:04.960 --> 22:09.520
because he's not saying mom and dad are talking extended family.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.280
Now, here's the thing and bear with me here.

22:11.840 --> 22:18.240
There is a play you could do and it is that you our town.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.520
You do our town realizes the importance of family.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.920
That's a right smart Nana you got there.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.440
That's my all gathered underneath the Nana nut tree.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.920
You just got to say something along the lines of

22:29.920 --> 22:32.080
we don't know how much longer she'll be.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.240
Oh, don't do that.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.520
I know, I know.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.960
That is a Nana curse.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.520
If I ever heard one, Travis, I do not know why you

22:40.160 --> 22:40.880
convinced this question.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.400
Ask her to curse their Nana.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.360
Fair enough.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.440
It's a Nana curse in three days.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.320
She'll be dragged.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.520
She'll be dragged forward.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.720
This Nana to someone else.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.960
Man, this Nana is really taking a beating in this question.

22:52.960 --> 22:53.460
Huh?

22:54.320 --> 22:56.720
Well, you have fucking done everything to this Nana.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.720
I feel like what you really need to do is just explain to him

22:58.720 --> 23:00.240
that this is important to you.

23:00.240 --> 23:00.560
Yeah.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.040
And like.

23:01.040 --> 23:01.200
Yeah.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.640
Have you tried like I'm as I get older, I'm more into this

23:04.640 --> 23:07.120
like whole direct communication thing.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.280
And I love a good scam.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.800
A good grift as much the next person.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.920
But maybe just say, hey, I this would mean a lot to me.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.060
Yeah.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.240
Boyfriend.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.560
Because that's the thing is you probably feel like you've had

23:18.560 --> 23:21.440
the conversation, but there's a lot of talking around it.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.480
You could do.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.120
And I feel like if you just say like, hey, this is important

23:25.120 --> 23:30.640
and he still is like, now, I will say that it does sound

23:30.640 --> 23:34.080
like if he doesn't have a car and he doesn't have the money,

23:34.800 --> 23:38.560
this isn't this doesn't strike me as the boyfriend saying,

23:38.560 --> 23:41.840
no, I don't really want to like it's a boyfriend saying

23:41.840 --> 23:44.160
literally I can't there.

23:44.160 --> 23:44.800
Yeah.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.600
So take that into account because this is probably is

23:47.600 --> 23:48.160
important.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.200
It is something that matters, but it may just not be the right

23:51.200 --> 23:51.760
time for it.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.320
You could do it any time of the year if you're only five hours

23:54.320 --> 23:54.720
away.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.440
Pop on a bus.

23:56.000 --> 23:56.240
Yeah.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.920
So maybe Christmas isn't the time.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.240
Maybe you wait a couple of months till he can afford it

24:00.240 --> 24:02.240
or you have a car that you can drive him up for.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.000
And then you do it.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.080
I'm saying there's probably going to be a Nana bound

24:06.080 --> 24:09.440
Super Bus that you can hop on and it's going to cost you

24:09.440 --> 24:12.000
$3 and you're going to have Wi-Fi the entire way there.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.880
And but it's just going to be you on the bus because it's

24:14.880 --> 24:18.240
a magic bus that goes directly to your Nana's house.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.240
How about your Nana comes down and meets him?

24:20.240 --> 24:20.480
Yeah.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.000
Tell her to stop being so lazy.

24:22.000 --> 24:22.640
What the fuck?

24:22.640 --> 24:24.800
God, you're a lazy man.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.080
Meet me halfway Nana.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.280
Brothers.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.400
My boyfriend's mother recently learned she would be receiving

24:30.400 --> 24:31.840
a sizable inheritance.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.880
I think it's around 30k.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.760
God damn.

24:34.640 --> 24:34.960
Yeah.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.480
And has decided to spend it by taking my boyfriend, myself,

24:39.040 --> 24:43.120
her, her other son, her wife, her a bunch of people on a big

24:43.120 --> 24:44.000
family vacation.

24:44.000 --> 24:44.400
Awesome.

24:45.200 --> 24:48.080
Except the last time I spoke to her, she was trying to devise

24:48.080 --> 24:50.000
between two possibilities.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.800
The Grand Canyon and Hawaii.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.880
Now brothers, I'm not an outdoor person.

24:54.880 --> 24:58.080
I have absolutely no interest in a Grand Canyon vacation.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.000
I would love to go to Hawaii.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.200
But I know that Hawaii would be significantly more expensive,

25:03.200 --> 25:06.000
especially in terms of paying for my boyfriend and myself.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.160
As we live on the East Coast and the flights will be twice as

25:08.160 --> 25:10.240
much as for anyone else on the trip.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.840
Would it be impolite to express my strong preference?

25:13.840 --> 25:17.600
Should I let her take whatever vacation she prefers with her

25:17.600 --> 25:20.640
money? And that's from craving beaches over canyons in

25:20.640 --> 25:21.440
Washington, D.C.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.040
This is a really good question.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.120
And this is a great question.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.880
My first counter question is, what is your problem with the

25:28.880 --> 25:30.080
Grand Canyon?

25:30.640 --> 25:31.840
It rules.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.800
It's giant.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.920
It's made of rocks.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.200
And I've never been there.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.720
But I imagine it would blow your tiny mind.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.320
Now, Travis, I don't think you're the best person to weigh on

25:42.320 --> 25:45.200
on this question, because if I remember correctly, you are the

25:45.200 --> 25:47.920
man who wouldn't drive four hours out of his way to see the

25:47.920 --> 25:48.880
Grand Canyon.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.240
Now, to be fair, Justin, I had a dog and a cat with me.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.760
It was a whole thing.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.120
It was going to be a whole deal.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.560
We would have had to take them with us.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.960
And it was like day seven of our cross-country trip.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.480
What is your problem with the Grand Canyon?

26:02.480 --> 26:03.600
It's a big hole.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.480
It's just a big hole.

26:04.480 --> 26:09.520
I maybe maybe fill up with water and let me swim in you lake.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.240
And then we'll talk.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.320
Can I?

26:12.320 --> 26:14.000
Grand Canyon is a shitty lake.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.120
It's a shitty dry lake.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.680
We've really turned around on the Grand Canyon since the

26:17.680 --> 26:18.800
beginning of this question.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.920
This is the very definition of a win-win scenario.

26:21.920 --> 26:26.160
Because if she chooses Hawaii, awesome.

26:26.160 --> 26:30.720
You are going to have a fucking sitcom special episode.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.160
And it's going to be amazing.

26:32.160 --> 26:32.800
And you're going to love it.

26:32.800 --> 26:33.760
You're going to have the best time ever.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.040
Go to the Grand Canyon.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.000
Going to save a lot of money.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.560
Probably only going to spend maybe five G's on that, right?

26:38.560 --> 26:39.120
Getting there.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.480
That leaves 25 G's of this inheritance left over.

26:42.480 --> 26:45.520
I have to be very delicate with my next few sentences because

26:45.520 --> 26:48.240
I don't want to implicate myself in anything.

26:48.240 --> 26:52.400
But as I see it, if you want this inheritance to kick your

26:52.400 --> 26:57.440
way, you've got maybe six or seven people standing in the

26:57.440 --> 27:00.880
way and the Grand Canyon, while a shitty lake.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.080
Got to be so careful.

27:02.080 --> 27:02.880
So carefully here.

27:04.960 --> 27:09.280
Is if things, let me think.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.480
Jesus Christ.

27:10.480 --> 27:15.840
Things that fall into it will pick up, let's call it a fatal

27:15.840 --> 27:16.880
amount of inertia.

27:19.200 --> 27:24.640
Now, I'm not saying anything about murder most foul, but I

27:24.640 --> 27:28.960
am saying how quickly can you push six or seven people?

27:28.960 --> 27:30.800
All I'm saying, win-win scenario.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.360
I'm not saying murder these people if you go to the Grand

27:33.360 --> 27:36.320
Canyon, but how much, how bad do you want this money?

27:36.320 --> 27:37.360
Here is one thing.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.720
Now, when you don't decide to push them into the Grand Canyon.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.280
Don't do that.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.560
I'm saying when you don't do that.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.400
When you don't do that and get them on a line and push them

27:50.400 --> 27:54.720
in the Grand Canyon, I cannot caution you enough against

27:54.720 --> 27:56.480
losing your nerve halfway through.

27:56.480 --> 28:01.520
Listen, if you only do three or four to lose your nerve,

28:01.520 --> 28:02.480
that's no good.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.480
Nothing good will come of that.

28:05.680 --> 28:06.960
We're not saying any of that.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.800
I'm saying I saw a YouTube video of somebody throwing seven

28:10.800 --> 28:15.440
watermelons into the Grand Canyon and they did not even

28:15.440 --> 28:17.600
come close to surviving the fall.

28:18.320 --> 28:22.640
I'm also saying that watermelons are the most human-like fruit

28:22.640 --> 28:23.840
and that's all I'm going to say.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.560
That's just where I stand on the matter.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.040
Do you know what this question asker did wrong?

28:30.240 --> 28:30.960
What's that?

28:30.960 --> 28:35.440
Their opportunity for this, not the other thing, but when you

28:35.440 --> 28:39.120
were talking with your boyfriend's mother, why didn't

28:39.120 --> 28:40.320
you say it then?

28:40.320 --> 28:42.400
Why weren't you like, oh, Hawaii would be great.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.600
Well, no, because it's her.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.080
I get it.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.040
It's her fucking money.

28:46.080 --> 28:48.240
You are not a member of the family.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.360
You are dating a member of the family, so it is super not

28:51.360 --> 28:52.240
your place to be like.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.520
No, but the loophole is this.

28:53.520 --> 28:56.720
It's not like she said Grand Canyon and you said, oh, how

28:56.720 --> 28:58.000
about Hawaii?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.840
She said either Grand Canyon or Hawaii.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.480
All you had to do is like, oh, Hawaii sounds fun or the Grand

29:02.480 --> 29:04.160
Canyon either way, but Hawaii, I've always wanted to go there.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.280
Because it's her 30 stacks.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.880
She gets to make the call.

29:08.880 --> 29:14.080
Oh, Hawaii is I feel like once you pay for the Grand Canyon

29:14.080 --> 29:15.520
trip, it's pretty much paid for.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.040
Once you go to Hawaii, though, I feel like you're just begging

29:19.040 --> 29:19.920
for upsells.

29:19.920 --> 29:20.560
But what about Burros?

29:20.560 --> 29:22.080
I think you're getting upsold a lot.

29:22.080 --> 29:22.320
What?

29:22.320 --> 29:23.360
What about Burros?

29:24.320 --> 29:25.680
You got to pay for the Burros.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.000
Burro rental?

29:28.000 --> 29:28.480
Yeah.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.520
Very cold donkeys.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.520
You got to get the audio.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.640
That was a shitty joke.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.240
Over here is a hole.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.280
No, a lot of people give us give a shit for not recognizing

29:37.280 --> 29:38.160
your good jokes.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.600
And I'm trying to get better about that.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.680
But that also means I'm going to call you out when you do a

29:41.680 --> 29:42.720
fucking terrible joke.

29:42.720 --> 29:43.840
Because it's a burro.

29:43.840 --> 29:44.720
Shut up.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.120
Stop it.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.320
He's a chili donkey.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.840
A burro.

29:49.840 --> 30:02.400
Two words, people.

30:04.000 --> 30:04.560
Chili donkey.

30:04.560 --> 30:04.720
Yeah.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.480
Two other words.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.200
Free snacks.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.800
Fatal inertia.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.000
Two more words.

30:14.000 --> 30:14.720
Free snacks.

30:15.440 --> 30:19.520
We're going to give you the chance to get free snacks.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.800
Potato chips aren't good for you.

30:20.800 --> 30:21.040
Nope.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.480
They're trash.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.440
Get delicious, wholesome snacks.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.800
That's what you need.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.640
And you're going to get them in hrbox.com.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.320
How do I do that?

30:30.320 --> 30:33.440
I just type in the thing to my web browser and then they come

30:33.440 --> 30:34.480
out of my CDR drive?

30:34.480 --> 30:35.840
Just tell you about these things.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.880
They have no artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners,

30:38.880 --> 30:42.560
zero grams of trans fat and no high fructose corn syrup.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.920
I mean, they do have color.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.160
Color is all that we can perceive.

30:46.160 --> 30:46.800
You know what I mean?

30:46.800 --> 30:48.320
They do have color and shape.

30:48.320 --> 30:48.560
Right.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.440
They're not invisible.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.520
They have texture and form.

30:51.520 --> 30:51.760
Right.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.800
What do we got new this month?

30:54.800 --> 30:58.000
Let me tell you about what we got new in nature box.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.440
This is a subscription service.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.120
Basically, they're going to be sending you a box of snacks

31:03.120 --> 31:03.840
that you choose.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.200
You choose what you want and they're going to send them to you.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.960
Here's some of the things you got here.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.880
Blueberry Greek yogurt pretzels.

31:10.880 --> 31:11.360
Whoa.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.240
How about this?

31:12.240 --> 31:13.840
Parmesan garlic pop pop.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.400
Oh, my God.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.560
They're doing they can do anything with pop pops.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.120
Are you ready?

31:17.120 --> 31:18.480
Because I haven't seen these before.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.920
Beef jerky.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.280
Beef jerky.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.080
If you're like me, that's like the best thing you've ever heard.

31:26.080 --> 31:29.040
That's pretty incredible because beef jerky that you get from like

31:29.040 --> 31:33.200
Alberto or Jack Links, otherwise known as shitty beef jerky.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.400
It's going to cost you like $48 at the gas station.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.280
It's stupid.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.360
Super quick.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.240
Super Google side.

31:40.240 --> 31:43.440
I watched the episode of Shark Tank where Jeff Foxworthy

31:43.440 --> 31:47.200
was one of the guest shark and somebody came pitching

31:47.200 --> 31:50.880
their beef jerky line and he said it was fine beef jerky,

31:50.880 --> 31:53.600
but he was unable to invest as he was already in the beef

31:53.600 --> 31:58.160
jerky business with his own personalized line of Jeff

31:58.160 --> 31:59.520
Foxworthy beef jerky.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.640
And it was like it was the most Jeff Foxworthy thing I've ever

32:02.640 --> 32:03.840
seen in my entire life.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.400
Carry on.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.520
You can get these free ass snacks.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.640
They're not ass snacks.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.040
They're just regular delicious wholesome snacks.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.640
You can get them for free.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.360
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother and you will get a free

32:15.360 --> 32:17.600
trial box of delicious snacks.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.920
Stay full, stay strong, my friends.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.240
Naturebox.com slash my brother.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.600
And if you work for Naturebox, daddy hasn't gotten a box

32:25.600 --> 32:26.080
in a while.

32:26.080 --> 32:26.560
Oh, come on.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.640
Just pay for it yourself.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.680
Just pay for it your fucking self.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.840
Maybe it's time to hit daddy with a taste of the crunch.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.160
So what's that address again?

32:36.160 --> 32:36.880
Because I missed it.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.800
Naturebox.com slash my brother.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.200
Perfect.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.000
I'll try that.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.120
Can I talk about Prosper?

32:43.840 --> 32:44.400
Please.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.040
Sure.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.400
Travis usually does it.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.400
And I feel like people are just ready for something new.

32:51.600 --> 32:51.840
Oh.

32:52.880 --> 32:57.280
Just saying, you're 2008 or 2000 late.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.640
Shit, 2008 is 2000 and late now, isn't it?

33:01.520 --> 33:02.240
Goddamn.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.000
You're 2000 and gore teen.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.840
I'm 2014.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.280
Stop being so gore teen.

33:07.280 --> 33:11.440
Guys, listen, there just aren't a lot of good ways to borrow

33:11.440 --> 33:12.400
money when you need it.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.680
2000 and snort teen.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.360
Fuck.

33:15.360 --> 33:20.080
If you need money, you're basically screwed nowadays.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.320
And bad news, you always need money.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.840
But you can get a low fixed rate loan at Prosper.com.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.360
How it works is this.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.560
You say, I need this many dollars.

33:30.560 --> 33:34.640
It can be up to $35,000, basically infinity dollars.

33:34.640 --> 33:38.400
And then people will come and invest in your loan.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.240
And then you'll get their money?

33:40.240 --> 33:43.520
I was waiting for Travis to confirm that.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.400
Oh, that is correct.

33:45.040 --> 33:45.520
Nailed it.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.240
Got it in one.

33:47.440 --> 33:50.880
So yeah, it doesn't have to be $35,000, but that's a, I mean,

33:50.880 --> 33:52.480
that seems like a pretty good sum to me.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.880
You can check your low rate instantly without affecting

33:56.880 --> 34:00.960
your credit if you go to Prosper.com slash my brother.

34:00.960 --> 34:04.240
And if you get a loan through Prosper, you can get a $50 visa

34:04.240 --> 34:05.680
gift card with your loan.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.280
And you can spend that on whatever the fuck you want.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.520
It's not like a Cracker Barrel gift card that you can only

34:11.520 --> 34:12.880
spend at Cracker Barrel.

34:12.880 --> 34:13.520
It's just-

34:13.520 --> 34:15.040
You could spend it at Cracker Barrel.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.080
Actually, I'm sorry.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.360
I'm reading the fine print here.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.160
Explicitly, you can't spend it at Cracker Barrel.

34:20.160 --> 34:24.560
But anywhere else that is not a good time country food store,

34:26.640 --> 34:27.440
just feel free.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.640
Justin, you wanna hit this disclaimer?

34:31.200 --> 34:34.560
Yes, I will be reading this in a character that I am creating

34:34.560 --> 34:38.400
in the moment called Christopher Lloyd, but also Kramer.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.200
Oh, okay.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.720
And possibly Richard Nixon.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.320
Well, this is just gonna be terrible.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.640
Other restrictions apply.

34:44.640 --> 34:48.640
See site for program and visa prepaid card details.

34:49.200 --> 34:52.800
All personal loans are made by Web Bank, a Utah Chartered

34:52.800 --> 34:57.600
Industrial Bank, member FDIC, equal opportunity lender.

34:58.800 --> 34:59.600
Great Jerry.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.600
Great Jerry, I'm not a crook.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.240
Oh, fuck.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.040
I got a message for Alan Michael.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.560
Is it from Queen Elizabeth?

35:08.560 --> 35:11.040
Alan, it says Alan Michael first name.

35:11.040 --> 35:11.600
What is that?

35:11.600 --> 35:13.200
Is the person's name Alan Michael?

35:13.760 --> 35:15.120
And then his last name is first name.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.920
Man, they really fucked the pooch on this one, didn't they?

35:19.920 --> 35:21.520
This is not like a library card.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.760
Queen Elizabeth says to Alan Michael,

35:25.760 --> 35:29.920
Hey, old man, what better way to wish you the happiest of birthdays

35:29.920 --> 35:32.000
than having the brothers do it for me?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
You're the greatest man in the world.

35:34.000 --> 35:34.960
Holy shit.

35:34.960 --> 35:39.040
And I hope you enjoy this because it's by far my favorite gift you'll get.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.480
I'm sure yours too.

35:40.480 --> 35:44.080
If Griffey wrote you a jingle though, this message would be put to shame.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.360
Love you tons.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.880
Love your bottom bitch.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.920
Well, I can't, I can't, guys.

35:51.920 --> 35:52.400
I forget.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.840
I don't have the music anymore.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.560
Also, I've got a sneeze caught in my nose too.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.040
And it's like really fucking throwing me off.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.480
And I don't think I can, hold on, let me try.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.760
I don't think I can, hold on, let me try.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.360
No, fuck this sneeze though.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.520
Sorry, everyone.

36:09.520 --> 36:10.640
I let you down.

36:10.640 --> 36:11.120
This next message.

36:11.120 --> 36:11.760
I got a message.

36:12.640 --> 36:13.360
Oh, wow.

36:14.000 --> 36:14.560
Sympathetic.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.240
Happy birthday, Alan Michael.

36:16.240 --> 36:16.720
Michelle.

36:16.720 --> 36:16.960
Yeah.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.040
Happy birthday, Alan Michael.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.240
We hope it's a great one, Alan Michelle.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.680
You're the greatest man in the world.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.640
You're the greatest living man, you bottom bitch.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.920
He's actually top bitch, I would assume.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.640
Is that how it works?

36:28.640 --> 36:30.400
HPIC baby.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.440
I don't know the lingo.

36:31.440 --> 36:36.080
I got a message for Julian from Brian and Sanford and Kate and Katie and Lilla.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.320
Maybe Lillia.

36:38.320 --> 36:38.720
I don't know.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.120
Lillia.

36:41.120 --> 36:45.920
Happy birthday to the finest playwright ever to sit around in his Walter White's.

36:45.920 --> 36:49.760
A man with more character than a waddle of Dinklage's.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.640
It's actually a converter.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.400
It's a murder of Dinklage's.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.080
It's a murder of Dinklage's, yes.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.800
A converter of dozens to the Church of McElroy.

36:56.800 --> 37:01.200
I know Griffin stopped writing jingles, but perhaps a reprise of Birthday Town for

37:01.200 --> 37:05.920
such a leader of Mbim-bim-bim-bini is in order.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.440
An anachronistic rendition of griffinspacejam.com.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.560
Happy birthday.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.720
Fucking sneeze.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.640
It's my curse.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.240
I'm going to take it with me to my grave.

37:18.240 --> 37:21.280
I'm going to be on my deathbed like, here it comes.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.120
God bless you, son.

37:27.120 --> 37:27.680
It brings you back.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.320
God bless you.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.520
I saw the light.

37:29.520 --> 37:29.920
I saw the light.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.920
Do you guys want to know something about bottom bitch?

37:31.920 --> 37:32.720
What's that?

37:32.720 --> 37:37.040
Bottom bitch is the one girl the pimp reserves for himself or the player's favorite girl.

37:37.600 --> 37:42.080
So while it seems like a derogatory term, it seems like you want to be bottom bitch.

37:42.080 --> 37:42.720
Yeah.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.480
Well, depends on the pimp, doesn't it?

37:45.040 --> 37:47.440
Well, isn't that always the case, Griffin?

37:49.360 --> 37:50.240
Can I blow my nose?

37:50.240 --> 37:50.480
I gotta-

37:50.480 --> 37:51.440
It's her happy birthday?

37:51.440 --> 37:52.800
Happy birthday, I guess?

37:54.320 --> 37:54.880
I guess.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.880
Happy birthday, Alan, Michael, and Julian.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.680
Today, we are all bottom bitches.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.680
I gotta blow my nose or I'm gonna fucking die.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.560
Hey, Ross.

38:02.560 --> 38:03.280
Hey, Carrie.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.560
Hey, it's me, your co-host.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.760
Oh, yeah, we have a show, don't we?

38:05.760 --> 38:06.560
We have a show.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.520
Oh, no, Ross and Carrie.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.400
Oh, no, Ross and Carrie.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.120
It's about undercover investigations of fringe groups.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.520
Yeah, like the Tony Olomo Ministries cult.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.440
Yep, that's led by a pedophile.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.240
He's in jail.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.360
He's in jail.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.920
Also, we became Mormons.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.160
We became Raelians, which is a UFO group.

38:22.160 --> 38:22.720
That's right.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.800
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis.

38:24.800 --> 38:25.280
Yes.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.520
The 9-11 truthers.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.160
We got cupped.

38:28.160 --> 38:29.200
We got acupunctured.

38:29.200 --> 38:29.920
We got rakey.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.960
We've pretty much anything that you've heard of and been like,

38:32.960 --> 38:34.640
that doesn't sound quite right.

38:34.640 --> 38:35.600
We've done that.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.120
So you don't have to do it.

38:37.120 --> 38:42.240
So if you want to hear about this, and you should, then go to maximumfun.org.

38:47.520 --> 38:51.120
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.080
Game recognize the game, Rachel Sperling.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.040
Crushed it this week.

38:55.040 --> 38:55.360
Again.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.360
Is Rachel Sperling just the game now?

38:57.360 --> 38:59.520
Rachel Sperling, I mean, it's hard to say, right?

38:59.520 --> 39:03.440
Because I don't want to throw shade at my precious Drew.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.800
But Rachel Sperling, I'm just saying, watch the throne.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.560
That's all I'm saying.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.400
Just don't let her into the zone.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.600
Do not let her into our zone.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.400
Thank you, Rachel Sperling.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Holden Caulfield.

39:15.680 --> 39:20.720
Holden Caulfield asks, do snakes and birds ever make love to each other

39:20.720 --> 39:22.080
when scientists aren't looking?

39:22.080 --> 39:24.720
Yes. I know birds are real.

39:24.720 --> 39:25.280
Oh, okay.

39:25.280 --> 39:25.840
Next question.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.640
I know birds are really closely related to reptiles.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.440
Does that mean they sometimes get intimate with each other?

39:33.440 --> 39:36.160
Or are they so closely related that it would count as incest?

39:36.160 --> 39:38.080
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.400
The rest, the stuff before it did.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.760
But you lost me at that part.

39:42.400 --> 39:45.760
Also, if a bird and a snake were to cross breed,

39:45.760 --> 39:48.160
would the offspring be flying snakes?

39:48.160 --> 39:50.000
Yes, that's where Quetzalcoatl came from.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.280
Read the literature.

39:51.280 --> 39:55.440
Please help. It's for a bet I'm having with my friend Holden Caulfield.

39:55.440 --> 40:01.840
Now, to be fair, if it is a male, then it is a flying snake Quetzalcoatl.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.920
If it is a female, it is a cockatrice.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.040
Is that how it works?

40:07.040 --> 40:07.680
Yes.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.840
It's weird because you think it would,

40:09.840 --> 40:10.960
and I don't want to go blue here,

40:10.960 --> 40:13.600
but you would think it would be the other way around.

40:13.600 --> 40:17.840
Well, but they call it a cockatrice before they understood that that was the principle.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.360
So they thought like all animals were male till they decided to be female

40:21.360 --> 40:23.360
because scientists used to be really super dumb.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.400
What about a rock?

40:24.400 --> 40:26.160
Was that, is there a snake in there at all?

40:26.880 --> 40:28.400
No, it's just a stone, Griffin.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.040
You shut up.

40:31.040 --> 40:36.800
I bet that different animals probably fuck all the time when we're not watching, right?

40:37.360 --> 40:41.440
This is specifically, sorry, this question is specific.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.200
When scientists aren't watching.

40:43.200 --> 40:43.440
Yeah.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.600
Because that's all they'll believe.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.840
Well, you would think, no, that's the problem though,

40:47.840 --> 40:50.400
is that we're all fucking narcs, aren't we?

40:50.400 --> 40:53.360
Like if I was in the woods and I turned a corner and it was like,

40:55.440 --> 40:57.280
that's the sound of a snake and a bird fucking,

40:57.280 --> 41:00.640
I'd be like, oh, I need a scientist over here, right?

41:00.640 --> 41:02.320
Like I would narc them out in a second.

41:02.880 --> 41:03.840
Someone give me a scientist.

41:03.840 --> 41:07.280
I would Instagram that and then I would send it to all my scientist buddies, right?

41:07.280 --> 41:11.520
This person is basically just describing a deviant version of Toy Story.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.640
What in what?

41:12.640 --> 41:14.160
No, they're not at all.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.440
Scientists turn their backs and the snakes and birds are fucking.

41:18.080 --> 41:18.960
Toy Story 4.

41:19.680 --> 41:22.720
Toy Story 4, snakes and birds.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.160
Getting it on.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.280
Day 78.

41:25.280 --> 41:29.200
I've been watching the bird and the snake constantly without fail.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.160
So far, nothing is-

41:30.800 --> 41:31.600
My pen's out of ink.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.320
Hold on, I'll be right back.

41:34.880 --> 41:35.600
Oh man.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.800
Why are they both sitting there smoking cigarettes?

41:38.800 --> 41:43.600
What is happening? There's nothing that gets birds and snakes hornier

41:43.600 --> 41:46.720
than being watched by scientists for prolonged periods of time.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.220
Yeah.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.320
Hey, he's out of the room.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.280
You want to do this?

41:51.280 --> 41:51.920
I don't know.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.720
I don't know.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.400
I just, can I just, a really quick question?

41:56.400 --> 41:59.440
And I'm no scientist as we've established,

41:59.440 --> 42:01.360
because I could watch a bird and the snake fuck,

42:01.920 --> 42:05.440
but is the snakes cum?

42:05.440 --> 42:09.040
Do you mean jism?

42:09.040 --> 42:14.400
Is a snake's jism basically just little snakes?

42:15.680 --> 42:16.180
What?

42:20.160 --> 42:21.760
If you think about it-

42:22.400 --> 42:23.920
Slithering hither and yon.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.440
If a snake, when a snake, because they have to, right?

42:27.440 --> 42:28.080
If a snake.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.600
If it, no, snakes have to-

42:29.600 --> 42:30.160
When a snake.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.040
There are more snakes.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.400
There are always more snakes.

42:32.400 --> 42:32.960
When a snake-

42:32.960 --> 42:34.080
Could you with a snake?

42:34.080 --> 42:37.920
When a snake jisms, it's just little snakes, right?

42:39.120 --> 42:41.520
I always thought that's what was coming out of their fangs.

42:42.080 --> 42:43.040
Oh my God.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.000
That's horrifying, Justin.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.080
That's just really bad.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.280
Not only am I now dying of venom, but also, ew.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.320
Ew, gross.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.280
Suck the venom out.

42:51.280 --> 42:51.760
No.

42:51.760 --> 42:52.240
No.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.680
Nah, I'm actually cool.

42:53.680 --> 42:54.320
Ah, good.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.040
Give me a bird.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.880
Bird'll snuck the snake venom out.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.720
You know how those dirty birds do.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.320
Don't let there be a scientist around.

43:02.320 --> 43:06.400
If a snake looks at a bird and thinks, I'm gonna fuck that,

43:06.400 --> 43:10.880
is that the same as if a human looks at a dog and is like,

43:10.880 --> 43:11.760
I'm gonna fuck that?

43:13.840 --> 43:14.320
Well-

43:14.320 --> 43:15.680
Is that equivalent?

43:15.680 --> 43:18.720
Will you be shunned from snake society for birdiality?

43:19.360 --> 43:21.520
I'd rather not consider it.

43:21.520 --> 43:21.920
I'm seeing people-

43:21.920 --> 43:24.000
What if you eat it when you're done?

43:24.000 --> 43:26.560
If you eat, if you unhinge your jaw and eat the bird

43:26.560 --> 43:28.000
you just consummated your love with.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.480
And then it was like, you could convince him it was like a long game.

43:32.480 --> 43:33.840
That's pretty sweet, I guess.

43:34.480 --> 43:38.320
Seen a lot of responses, a lot of very level-headed responses

43:38.320 --> 43:39.280
to this answer.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.000
Sure, right.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.280
A bird and a snake cannot biologically crossbreed.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.880
They are two completely different species.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.560
The egg would never get fertilized.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.960
Hey, you fucking bigot.

43:49.680 --> 43:52.800
Not all sex has to be for breeding.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.480
They may just be doing it for fun.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.360
That sounds like a scientist to me.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.920
And that's why you will never witness their love.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.120
And it's amazing.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.760
That's why you don't get to watch a bird and a snake fuck.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.360
You close-minded shit.

44:05.360 --> 44:08.960
We uneducated few get to see the magic and the majesty

44:08.960 --> 44:10.880
that is a bird and a snake fucking.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.600
And let me tell you, it is glorious.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.720
I don't know if that had been a lyric in that ICP tune.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.280
Did you ever see a bird and a snake fuck?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.880
That's actually where the phrase ignorance is bliss came from.

44:22.880 --> 44:26.400
It's because when you're ignorant, you get to see that sexy shit.

44:26.400 --> 44:26.720
Oh my god.

44:26.720 --> 44:30.160
Do you think it's more likely that a male snake would fuck a female bird

44:30.160 --> 44:32.160
or that a female snake would fuck a male bird?

44:32.160 --> 44:33.840
Oh, that's a toughie, Travis.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.240
Hey, why can't it be a male bird and a male snake?

44:44.240 --> 44:47.760
Do you ever think there's ever been a committed bird snake couple

44:47.760 --> 44:52.320
that were living with someone who is in a science discipline

44:52.320 --> 44:55.440
and then they graduated and got a job in science

44:55.440 --> 44:58.320
and then they said, listen, this isn't working out.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.120
Listen, we gotta go.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.240
You can't observe us anymore.

45:02.240 --> 45:02.720
I'm sorry.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.960
You should have thought of this before you got so into science.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.920
Every so often people email us or tweet at us and ask us

45:07.920 --> 45:10.720
if we're really stoned when we record episodes.

45:10.720 --> 45:13.040
I cannot stress enough that we are not.

45:13.040 --> 45:13.760
I wish we were.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.160
You're not.

45:14.160 --> 45:14.960
I'm stoned on coffee.

45:14.960 --> 45:15.520
That's it.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.240
You want another question?

45:16.240 --> 45:16.400
Yep.

45:17.360 --> 45:18.480
Then let me use the bathroom.

45:18.480 --> 45:19.680
God damn it.

45:19.680 --> 45:23.280
My friend went through a breakup with her longtime boyfriend this past summer.

45:23.280 --> 45:27.120
And since then, she's been texting me mass amounts of selfies every day.

45:28.160 --> 45:31.840
I don't want to be insensitive or mean, but it makes you really uncomfortable.

45:33.360 --> 45:36.000
If she's still having a hard time, I want to be there for her,

45:36.000 --> 45:40.240
but I have no idea how to respond to her constant duck face pictures.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.160
What should I do?

45:42.160 --> 45:43.680
That's from Jen in Chicago.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.040
Holy shit.

45:45.040 --> 45:49.120
What makes this so weird is that she's sending them directly to you.

45:49.120 --> 45:53.920
You like if it was just her posting a bunch on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and so.

45:53.920 --> 45:54.800
Okay, fine.

45:54.800 --> 45:55.440
Great.

45:55.440 --> 45:56.960
Why is she sending them to you?

45:58.800 --> 46:00.720
Look at me here and look at me here.

46:00.720 --> 46:01.280
Look at me here.

46:01.280 --> 46:01.840
Look at me here.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.360
And what my mouth can do.

46:03.360 --> 46:04.560
This is my face again.

46:04.560 --> 46:05.360
Did you forget?

46:05.360 --> 46:06.720
Did you forget what I look like?

46:07.520 --> 46:08.640
Look how happy I am.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.840
I bet that's it.

46:09.840 --> 46:10.560
I bet it's that.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.280
Look at me.

46:11.280 --> 46:13.120
I'm having a good time without him.

46:13.120 --> 46:14.160
Look how happy I am.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.080
I'm so okay.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.080
Yeah, which has to be true.

46:18.080 --> 46:25.040
I've never heard of anybody sending people selfies directly.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.240
I mean, is this a thing?

46:26.880 --> 46:27.600
I don't know.

46:27.600 --> 46:34.560
It's a if it's a thing, it's what?

46:34.560 --> 46:35.760
What are you guys laughing at?

46:37.840 --> 46:38.800
Oh Griffin.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.160
Griffin is just selfie does.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.320
Guys.

46:42.320 --> 46:43.600
Get a quick screencap.

46:43.600 --> 46:44.000
Uh oh.

46:44.000 --> 46:44.800
Get this out to the people.

46:44.800 --> 46:45.360
Oh, that's not.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.640
I don't look good in that one.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.600
I don't look internet good in that picture.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.320
I look text.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.400
I look text to my brothers on a Sunday morning.

46:52.400 --> 46:53.040
Good.

46:53.040 --> 46:55.600
Is there any kind of text associated with these selfies?

46:55.600 --> 46:58.160
Is she saying like, this is me having fun in a bar.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.320
This is me in front of the Eiffel Tower.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.200
Or is she just like?

47:02.480 --> 47:05.200
How did you get to France that quickly?

47:05.200 --> 47:05.840
You just sent me.

47:05.840 --> 47:08.400
You just sent me a selfie from the Grand Canyon two hours ago.

47:09.040 --> 47:09.520
You're amazing.

47:09.520 --> 47:10.480
You're incredible.

47:10.480 --> 47:12.640
You're you're a time walker.

47:13.840 --> 47:14.720
I don't.

47:14.720 --> 47:19.520
I don't understand why this is happening.

47:19.520 --> 47:26.240
Like this goes beyond all cultural things that I understand about the internet.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.920
Is this like my old man moment?

47:27.920 --> 47:30.000
Is this like when it falls apart for me?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.560
Because I don't understand why people send pictures of each other.

47:32.560 --> 47:33.360
I'll tell you why.

47:33.360 --> 47:34.800
Because this is your old man moment.

47:36.720 --> 47:39.360
I'm willing because the question asker asked.

47:39.360 --> 47:40.480
So it's like, OK, great.

47:40.480 --> 47:41.920
This is weird to you, too.

47:41.920 --> 47:47.360
Like this is weird to the question asker as well as being weird to probably everyone listening.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.040
So here's my advice.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.240
You should ask her why she's doing this.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.000
Just ask her.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.880
Yeah, and like ask her for us.

47:56.880 --> 48:03.920
It's so just so we know because I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight because the next time she sends one just say like, hey, this is great.

48:03.920 --> 48:05.840
But I noticed you're sending a lot of selfies.

48:05.840 --> 48:06.400
What's up?

48:07.040 --> 48:07.600
What are they?

48:07.600 --> 48:12.720
Why is this if I got nice pictures of my friends, I wouldn't be complaining.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.880
I love I love my friends and I love looking at them.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.560
At what point, Griffin?

48:18.560 --> 48:20.240
All points become too much.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.840
Oh, never send me a picture of you guys.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.280
Never send me pictures yourself.

48:25.280 --> 48:28.240
I find myself fucking forgetting what you look like.

48:28.240 --> 48:31.040
I know one of you has a beard and one of you doesn't.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.360
Does one of you have the best?

48:33.360 --> 48:34.560
Does one of you have glasses?

48:35.120 --> 48:36.080
That's the best you've got.

48:36.080 --> 48:39.120
That's all that I've got because you fucks won't send me pictures of you.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.920
But isn't that any pictures of my baby?

48:41.920 --> 48:43.120
Yeah, that's not you, is it?

48:43.120 --> 48:47.280
I can look at that and say, what if that was a boy that was like 45 years older?

48:49.760 --> 48:51.520
I'm just saying this seems like a nice service.

48:51.520 --> 48:53.040
I wish I wish my friend.

48:53.040 --> 48:58.640
I don't use Facebook anymore because fucking all that my Facebook wall is is videos of people popping.

48:58.640 --> 48:59.360
Big pimples.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.400
Thanks, Facebook.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.800
And thanks you sick fucks use Facebook.

49:02.800 --> 49:03.040
Right.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.440
I can't do it anymore because it's so terrible.

49:05.440 --> 49:08.320
So I don't know what my friends look like or my brothers or family.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.240
Send me pictures of yourselves every day.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.360
I don't think that's too much to ask.

49:11.360 --> 49:13.360
I think this is a very sweet gesture.

49:13.360 --> 49:14.160
Y'all want a Yahoo?

49:15.600 --> 49:17.440
Uh, yes, that would be excellent.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.360
Um, let's try this Yahoo auto.

49:23.360 --> 49:24.560
Sent in by Rachel Sperling.

49:24.560 --> 49:25.440
Game recognized game.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.080
Thank you, Rachel.

49:26.080 --> 49:30.960
It's by Yahoo answers user Vicky who asks, could someone pretty please write a vampire story?

49:30.960 --> 49:34.560
Please start in a dark forest at midnight.

49:34.560 --> 49:38.720
And there is a girl named Elena who gets hypnotized and bitten by a slow down.

49:38.720 --> 49:39.280
Slow down.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.400
Okay, okay, okay.

49:40.400 --> 49:43.040
Start in a dark forest at midnight.

49:43.040 --> 49:49.840
And there is a girl named Elena who gets hypnotized and bitten by a vampire named Josiah.

49:49.840 --> 49:52.560
I want eye contact hypnosis, please.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.880
Okay, first of all, that's called thrall.

49:55.600 --> 49:56.720
It's not called hypnosis.

49:57.600 --> 49:58.480
You're in the thrall.

49:59.120 --> 50:00.080
Geez, amateurs.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.440
Glamour is what I prefer.

50:03.440 --> 50:05.600
Uh, glamour is something that masks you.

50:05.600 --> 50:10.000
So it's more like, uh, you would cast a glamour on someone to, so they would ignore you.

50:10.720 --> 50:13.600
Yeah, but in true blood, they call it glamoring and they verb it.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.680
I go, he glamored me into doing this.

50:15.680 --> 50:19.440
I think that means you dress them up in sequence and, and you made them more glamour.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.720
That's dazzle them.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.720
What a fucking stupid show.

50:22.720 --> 50:27.360
That sounds like never seen it, but it sounds pretty goddamn dumb.

50:27.360 --> 50:30.240
Can someone please write me a vampire story?

50:30.240 --> 50:32.720
Please, please, please, please, please.

50:32.720 --> 50:33.280
Please, please.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.880
There is not enough vampire fiction out there.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.720
Erotic vamp fiction.

50:38.720 --> 50:41.440
So is the question asker asking someone to write them a story?

50:41.440 --> 50:41.760
Uh-huh.

50:41.760 --> 50:44.320
And it's got to have a girl named Elena and then a vampire named Josiah.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.240
And it's got to have eye contact hypnosis.

50:46.240 --> 50:50.000
Can I just say, I really like this because I think we could call it choose my own adventure.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.600
And it's just like, hey, I'm going to tell you what I want in the story.

50:53.600 --> 50:57.040
I think I used to have a book like this where I was a little kid and mom and dad brought it,

50:57.040 --> 51:01.600
bought it for me for my birthday, where I went to like planet Travis and they had a machine that

51:01.600 --> 51:02.480
worked on wishes.

51:02.480 --> 51:08.800
I think a choose my own adventure book is just a book, right?

51:10.960 --> 51:14.240
God, I wish books would just choose the fucking adventure for me.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.920
Just tell me a story.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.400
I didn't buy this fucking thing to write it myself.

51:18.400 --> 51:19.680
This is garbage.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.600
Neil Patrick Harris, you lazy shit.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.680
What do you think this person wants the story for?

51:27.680 --> 51:30.720
Do you think it's an assignment where they have to write it and they're going,

51:30.720 --> 51:34.000
at least I've got all the bones of it, but I just can't put the meat on it.

51:34.000 --> 51:34.240
Yeah.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.880
From, from their, their teacher, Miss Clitoris.

51:41.600 --> 51:42.800
She's starting, but fair.

51:43.440 --> 51:46.720
Can someone fucking write this person?

51:47.680 --> 51:47.920
Okay.

51:47.920 --> 51:48.720
So let's go through it.

51:48.720 --> 51:50.080
She's in a dark forest at night.

51:50.720 --> 51:50.960
Okay.

51:50.960 --> 51:52.400
How much time do we have left in the show?

51:52.960 --> 51:54.720
Enough time to write some erotic vampire.

51:54.720 --> 51:55.360
Okay.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.480
Let's, let's, let's, let's write one.

51:58.480 --> 51:59.360
I'm the oldest.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.720
I'll start.

52:00.720 --> 52:01.360
Okay.

52:01.360 --> 52:05.040
And I'll like an exquisite corpse.

52:06.640 --> 52:06.960
Yeah.

52:07.680 --> 52:08.400
Maybe not once.

52:08.400 --> 52:08.640
Okay.

52:08.640 --> 52:08.720
Yeah.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.920
We'll do one sentence at a time.

52:09.920 --> 52:10.560
That'd be good.

52:10.560 --> 52:10.800
Okay.

52:13.280 --> 52:15.200
The night was dark and also horny.

52:16.640 --> 52:18.960
The forest was as dark as it was horny too.

52:20.560 --> 52:24.800
My name is Elena and this forest got me feeling real horny down there.

52:24.800 --> 52:32.800
I swired a shape in the darkness that was white, but had eyes and a cape and maybe fangs.

52:32.800 --> 52:35.520
It was definitely glamorous, but also erotic.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.680
His name was Josiah.

52:37.680 --> 52:41.760
He didn't tell me that, but he looked like one.

52:42.800 --> 52:45.040
He looked like my friend, Josiah.

52:45.040 --> 52:45.840
There's more than one.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.200
There was a semicolon in there.

52:47.200 --> 52:51.360
He looked like my friend Josiah from work at Dress Barn.

52:51.360 --> 52:53.040
I got closer to him.

52:53.040 --> 52:58.480
I saw that underneath the cape, he was wearing some sensible jeans and no shirt, but he just

52:58.480 --> 53:01.280
had like a cape and his muscles were like, yes.

53:01.280 --> 53:04.160
And I didn't know much, but he was definitely bonered.

53:05.680 --> 53:07.200
I could see it through his jeans.

53:07.200 --> 53:09.040
I could see the boner through his jeans.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.120
Another semicolon was in there.

53:13.120 --> 53:15.280
They were as sensible as they were see-through.

53:16.480 --> 53:17.280
It's not your turn.

53:17.280 --> 53:17.920
Oh, sorry.

53:17.920 --> 53:19.440
I looked at his eyes.

53:19.440 --> 53:25.760
They reminded me of Josiah, my friend at Dress Barn, and that's when it occurred to me.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.280
I'm going to bone this dude.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.320
I'm going to bone him.

53:30.320 --> 53:31.600
Like, you're good.

53:31.600 --> 53:33.680
I don't know where these thoughts are coming from.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.880
They definitely weren't my own.

53:34.880 --> 53:39.600
I feel like you're not saying yes and right now, Jarvis, I think you're saying yes boner-ish.

53:39.600 --> 53:43.280
No, you said that's when it occurred to me that I was going to bone this dude.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.320
I'm going to bone him.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.280
I'm going to bone him.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.320
I'm going to bone him.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.000
I'm going to bone this dude.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.920
And also, I hate to take on bridge, and then it occurred to me it's not a complete sentence.

53:53.680 --> 53:54.640
There was a hyphen.

53:54.640 --> 53:56.080
There was ellipses at the end.

53:57.840 --> 53:58.480
Chapter two.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.840
I got fired from Dress Barn today.

54:07.280 --> 54:10.000
I got fired by my manager, Josiah.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.120
I thought he was my friend.

54:11.120 --> 54:16.240
And also, he has amazing muscles, and he doesn't wear a shirt, and he wears a cape.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.160
But a different cape.

54:18.160 --> 54:19.920
We're talking about a different Josiah here.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.440
I can't express this enough.

54:21.440 --> 54:21.840
I wish.

54:22.800 --> 54:23.520
I wish.

54:23.520 --> 54:26.240
I really tried to get a hook into this story, Travis.

54:26.240 --> 54:27.760
You were just not letting it happen.

54:27.760 --> 54:31.040
I wish everything in my house smelled like Dress Barn, Josiah.

54:33.920 --> 54:36.240
Suddenly, there was a clattering at my window.

54:36.240 --> 54:37.440
It was Santa Claus.

54:37.440 --> 54:43.040
I fucked my brain in the sexy stuff.

54:45.040 --> 54:48.240
Turns out Santa was a drakul all along.

54:49.200 --> 54:55.360
Santa climbed in my window, and he opened up his sack, and he let it fall to the ground.

54:55.360 --> 55:00.160
And inside, there was just one gift, and it was Josiah, the vampire from earlier,

55:00.160 --> 55:02.000
and not the Dress Barn, Josiah.

55:02.000 --> 55:07.920
And he looked deep into my eyeballs, and I got totally bonered for him.

55:07.920 --> 55:09.600
And then Santa Claus was like,

55:09.600 --> 55:14.000
Well, I guess I should get going.

55:14.720 --> 55:18.400
Seems like things are about to get a little bit lusty in here.

55:18.400 --> 55:22.560
I've got other sex draculas to drop off at kids' houses like you.

55:24.800 --> 55:29.040
And then Josiah spun around, and he drank Santa's blood.

55:29.040 --> 55:29.600
Oh, no.

55:29.600 --> 55:30.160
Until he died.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.600
And let me be honest, it was a huge turn on.

55:34.240 --> 55:42.080
So I reached inside of his sack, and I got out hundreds of sex draculas, all for me.

55:47.840 --> 55:48.640
I'm not done.

55:48.640 --> 55:49.280
I'm not done.

55:49.280 --> 56:04.720
I crowd surfed on the sex draculas like Buckethead at a corn show when Buckethead was stealing

56:04.720 --> 56:04.960
corn.

56:05.920 --> 56:06.720
Was he ever?

56:09.440 --> 56:10.480
Did he glamour him?

56:10.480 --> 56:12.560
Yeah, I said the thing about the eye fucking.

56:12.560 --> 56:13.360
Okay.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.200
I think we just covered all our bases there.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.120
Also, wait, hold on.

56:17.120 --> 56:18.720
Oh, hold on.

56:18.720 --> 56:19.360
Somebody's at my door.

56:19.360 --> 56:19.840
Give me a second.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.200
Oh, it's a major book publisher, and we're all millionaires.

56:25.200 --> 56:29.520
So yeah, this is the last episode of the podcast, I guess.

56:29.520 --> 56:30.720
There's an editor's note.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.080
I turned a page.

56:32.080 --> 56:35.200
There's an editor's note that Buckethead wasn't in corn.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.280
Yeah, he doesn't know what he was thinking about.

56:37.280 --> 56:39.200
That he did some sorts of GNR, though.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.200
Maybe that's what we'll put that in later editions.

56:41.200 --> 56:44.160
And it's going to make this first edition like super rare and super valuable.

56:44.160 --> 56:47.840
I was thinking a monkey, I think.

56:47.840 --> 56:52.880
Welcome to our rare book section here at the Library of Congress.

56:52.880 --> 56:56.960
Come and you won't believe what's in this edition of Sex Dracula's.

56:58.560 --> 57:01.040
So I think that's going to do it for us.

57:01.040 --> 57:01.440
We done?

57:01.440 --> 57:02.080
Yeah, I think so.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.360
Yes, pretty much done.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.040
I don't want to do the podcast anymore.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.320
We're kind of into books now.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.720
Listen, we're doing a live show in December 21st.

57:12.720 --> 57:17.200
That is going to be in Huntington, West Virginia, our hometown, at Huntington City Hall Auditorium.

57:17.200 --> 57:24.560
If you want tickets to that, you can go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights Live.

57:24.560 --> 57:26.480
And you can pick those up.

57:26.480 --> 57:27.280
They're 15 bucks.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.920
We've sold almost 500.

57:30.800 --> 57:33.520
I can't fucking believe how many people are going to be at this show.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.000
I know.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.160
It's going to be popping off in like a major way.

57:36.720 --> 57:39.600
And everybody's going to have a really good time.

57:39.600 --> 57:44.480
A really good time, I do want to tell you, if you're coming in for the show and you haven't

57:44.480 --> 57:50.800
gotten hotel accommodations yet, Chase Henderson, who's the guy putting the show together for us,

57:51.520 --> 57:57.280
has arranged a special deal with the Pullman Plaza Hotel where they're going to give people

57:57.280 --> 57:59.920
coming in for the show a special $99 rate.

58:00.800 --> 58:07.920
So if you want to get in on that, you call 866-613-3611 and say you're getting a room

58:07.920 --> 58:11.040
for the My Brother, My Brother and Me show before December 17th.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.320
And you can get one at a discounted rate.

58:12.320 --> 58:15.440
That would be a great place to stay because it would actually be really close.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.200
That would be walkable to the theater.

58:19.200 --> 58:22.960
It would be walkable to the Lantern, which is where we're meeting up after the show.

58:22.960 --> 58:25.040
And it's really close to Pullman Square.

58:25.040 --> 58:28.000
There's a lot of places to like eat and shop, whatever you want to do.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.440
So that would be a good place to stay.

58:29.440 --> 58:36.160
Again, the number's 866-613-3611 and you can get into that discounted room.

58:36.160 --> 58:38.400
Also, go ahead and start sending in your Candle Nights questions.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.520
Please, please, please.

58:39.520 --> 58:42.960
And if you're going to be at the show, make sure that that's clear in your question.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.520
We'll probably also take some questions for the audience.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.440
So be thinking about that when you get there as well.

58:47.440 --> 58:50.880
Just make sure to put Candle Nights in the subject line so that I can find it.

58:51.440 --> 58:54.560
Speaking of tickets, Max Fun Con tickets are on sale now.

58:54.560 --> 59:00.080
Hopefully they will be on sale when this episode goes live.

59:00.080 --> 59:05.840
At the time of this recording on Sunday, like 70% of the tickets are sold out.

59:05.840 --> 59:09.840
You can go to maxfuncon.com and you'll see the link for tickets there.

59:09.840 --> 59:12.800
Again, if they're sold out by the time this goes out, sorry.

59:13.520 --> 59:16.000
We've tweeted about it and so has the official account.

59:16.560 --> 59:21.040
But it is, guys, it's seriously the most fun ever.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.200
So check it out, please.

59:23.840 --> 59:25.760
We have new merch available for you.

59:26.320 --> 59:31.840
Go to maxfunstore.com and you're going to find that stuff.

59:31.840 --> 59:33.840
We've got cool buttons.

59:33.840 --> 59:36.720
We've got our Fraternal Order of Brothers patch.

59:38.000 --> 59:38.800
Bumper stickers.

59:40.480 --> 59:41.920
A question mark poster.

59:41.920 --> 59:44.480
Now, I think this is a new item since the last time we recorded.

59:45.520 --> 59:49.760
This is a very cool Saul-based inspired design by our friend Justin Russo.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.320
We sell a blue version of this at live shows.

59:53.760 --> 59:59.040
And it is red and it is really, it is probably my favorite,

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.440
like some of my favorite My Brother, My Brother, Me imagery.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.920
It's in, I got it hanging in my office, I'm looking at it right now.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.480
It really is so, so, so cool.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.440
So go get that, the question mark poster.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.760
Also, make sure to follow us on Twitter.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.280
We've got a couple new projects coming up that you're going to be really,

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.840
really excited about and we're going to announce them first on Twitter.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.600
So follow us at MBMBAM for all the awesome news.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.960
It's just good to follow us anyways,

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.360
because we usually talk about stuff on there before we get to the show,

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.720
because we only do the show once a week.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.920
Uh, big thanks to the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.480
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.880
You can find that album on iTunes, Amazon, wherever,

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.960
