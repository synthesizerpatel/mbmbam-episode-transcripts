00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
Hi, it's Jesse, the founder of MaxFun.

00:03.440 --> 00:05.760
We promised you a MaxFun drive this week,

00:05.760 --> 00:09.800
but things haven't exactly gone how we expected.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.320
So given the pandemic,

00:12.320 --> 00:15.200
we're gonna postpone this year's drive.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.160
Events are still fluid,

00:17.160 --> 00:19.880
so we're hesitant to give you specifics about new dates.

00:19.880 --> 00:23.240
Right now we have late April penciled into our calendars.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.280
We'll keep you posted about that.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.440
As it stands,

00:26.440 --> 00:29.120
a lot of our drive machinery was already cranked up.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.480
So for one thing,

00:30.480 --> 00:33.640
you might hear a reference or two to the drive in our shows,

00:33.640 --> 00:37.200
which might've been recorded before we made this decision.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.440
And here's some good news.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.720
There's a bunch of great bonus content

00:41.720 --> 00:44.160
available for all of our MaxFun members.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.960
If you're a member and you missed the email

00:45.960 --> 00:47.560
with instructions on how to listen,

00:47.560 --> 00:49.240
check your spam folder,

00:49.240 --> 00:54.240
or log in at maximumfun.org slash manage.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.440
Also at maximumfun.org slash manage,

00:57.440 --> 00:59.000
you can change your membership.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.360
If your circumstances have changed,

01:01.360 --> 01:03.600
we know this is a tough time for a lot of people

01:03.600 --> 01:05.240
and we understand.

01:05.240 --> 01:09.920
You can also go to maximumfun.org slash join at any time

01:09.920 --> 01:11.520
if you'd like to become a member.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.200
During the next couple of weeks,

01:14.200 --> 01:16.240
what would have been the drive,

01:16.240 --> 01:20.320
we're going to do our best to be extra available to you.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.120
We've got some streaming events planned,

01:22.120 --> 01:23.760
some social media stuff.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.480
We know a lot of folks are isolated right now

01:26.480 --> 01:28.160
and we wanna help provide comfort

01:28.160 --> 01:30.200
in the best ways that we know how.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.960
You can follow us on social media

01:31.960 --> 01:33.600
and we'll let you know what's up.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.560
During this tough time,

01:34.560 --> 01:37.000
I have been feeling really grateful

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
for my community of colleagues here at MaxFun

01:41.000 --> 01:44.600
and for you, the folks who make our work possible.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.680
Goofy as that work may sometimes be.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.160
Stay safe out there.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.520
We're thinking of you.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.160
The McElroy brothers are not experts

01:54.160 --> 01:57.040
and their advice should never be followed.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.400
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

01:59.400 --> 02:02.800
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.120
Also, this show isn't for kids,

02:05.120 --> 02:07.520
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

02:07.520 --> 02:09.840
will know how cool they are for listening.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.240
What's up, you cool baby?

02:11.240 --> 02:36.040
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

02:36.040 --> 02:41.520
Hello everyone and welcome to, hold on, let me open this book

02:41.520 --> 02:42.840
to a new chapter.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.680
Welcome to a new era of my brother, my brother and me,

02:46.680 --> 02:48.560
a lifestyle experience guide.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.520
Ooh.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.720
My name is Justin McElroy.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.160
I'm your oldest guide.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.240
Hey, this is Griffin.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.680
I go second now and yeah,

02:58.680 --> 03:02.520
I'm all about just sort of these orbs, guys.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.000
Hi, I'm Travis.

03:05.000 --> 03:05.840
All right.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.200
Yep, you see it's so weird.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.000
I will wait for three hours for Griffin to do his now.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.640
Hey, it's me Griffin again.

03:11.640 --> 03:15.280
Just checking in about these orbs.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.760
You touched these orbs yet?

03:16.760 --> 03:19.600
No, you got to get with these orbs, man.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.840
Hi, I'm Travis.

03:20.840 --> 03:25.600
I'm kind of the CFO of our lifestyle brands.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.480
I'm not so much on the creative,

03:27.480 --> 03:29.800
but I make sure everyone gets paid

03:29.800 --> 03:32.600
and that their health insurance stays current.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.440
He's afraid of these orbs.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.160
I keep telling him nothing to be afraid of

03:36.160 --> 03:37.920
unless you drop one on your foot.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.840
I appreciate the orbs, but I am looking at the books

03:41.840 --> 03:45.120
and it does say here in our ledgers

03:45.120 --> 03:46.760
that we still use for some reason

03:46.760 --> 03:49.120
that it is time to pay the piper.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.320
Oh, that's right.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.160
Yeah.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.000
Oh boy.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.720
Thank you, Travis, for bringing up this awkward.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.200
Now listen, we begged Travis not to do this.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.120
I didn't beg him.

03:59.120 --> 03:59.960
We said it's a new era.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.240
Creatives over here, they were saying like,

04:01.240 --> 04:05.360
we're focused on these artisanal paper

04:05.360 --> 04:08.320
and artisanal glasses.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.880
Artisanal air, Griffin, you said at one point,

04:10.880 --> 04:11.720
which I didn't get.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.080
Well, it's inside the orbs, isn't it?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.000
I guess.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.480
Something's gotta be in there.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.320
There's a piper here.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.080
There's an artisanal piper that you guys ordered

04:20.080 --> 04:21.760
and someone needs to pay them.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.080
So we're gonna talk a little bit more about it

04:24.080 --> 04:26.560
later in the show, but should we just start

04:27.560 --> 04:31.160
telling people about what kind of a new body slime?

04:31.160 --> 04:36.160
We're into and what kind of acupuncture needles

04:36.920 --> 04:39.080
we're all about these days.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.760
Do you know what's way in, Griffin?

04:40.760 --> 04:41.760
What is it?

04:41.760 --> 04:45.320
It's getting wet and rolling around in sand

04:45.320 --> 04:47.320
and then just getting dressed over that

04:47.320 --> 04:48.520
and going about your day.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.880
It's like a natural exfoliant.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.000
Just having a little gritty time in the city.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.040
Yeah.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.040
I like this.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.320
And then at the end of the day,

04:56.320 --> 04:58.400
your boss is riding your freaking jock

04:58.400 --> 04:59.880
trying to get you to file those reports.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.440
You get home, you take a shower,

05:02.440 --> 05:04.000
Pearl falls out of your butt crack.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.240
Yep.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.280
It can happen.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.760
It does happen every day to people like you

05:08.760 --> 05:09.600
and now can happen.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.040
I'm afraid Justin died.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.920
We're gonna start out with kind of a retro vibe

05:12.920 --> 05:15.160
and take a question from our listenership

05:15.160 --> 05:17.520
and then we'll ease into some of the bigger changes.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.200
We should point out, and you know what?

05:19.200 --> 05:21.840
We should also point out, we are recording this

05:21.840 --> 05:25.480
for the first time ever weeks ahead of time,

05:25.480 --> 05:28.320
which is why our first question is about Valentine's Day,

05:28.320 --> 05:33.200
which will seem weird when you hear this in mid-March.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.720
I collected money for a Valentine's Day singing gram

05:35.720 --> 05:39.000
for one of my professors and got $1 from one girl

05:39.000 --> 05:41.920
and $2 and quarters from a guy.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.920
The gram is $5.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.280
Then I got so dang busy,

05:45.280 --> 05:47.760
I didn't find the time to buy the gram

05:47.760 --> 05:49.680
and their money is sitting on my desk.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.240
It's been three days.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.160
They haven't asked,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.320
but I know they didn't get a singing gram.

05:54.320 --> 05:59.000
Do I steal their $3 or awkwardly give it back?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.200
Now, I just want to clarify,

06:01.200 --> 06:04.120
because Justin used the wrong word there.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.680
They know that the professor didn't get a singing gram.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.960
So the two people that this question asker

06:09.960 --> 06:11.560
collected money from are well aware

06:11.560 --> 06:15.800
that that money was not spent on a singing telegram.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.720
Okay.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.440
Is this not why Venmo was invented?

06:19.440 --> 06:21.120
Or PayPal or whatever your-

06:21.120 --> 06:24.000
Oh, Sharon just sent you $2

06:24.000 --> 06:27.040
with the note, I fucked up Valentine's Day.

06:27.040 --> 06:27.880
Like, yeah.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.720
Like, yes.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.440
It's how you send money when you're embarrassed.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.800
It's how you pay for things you're scared about, you know?

06:34.800 --> 06:37.520
You could call it an investment in next year's gram.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.120
Thank you for your early support

06:39.120 --> 06:43.960
of building on a layaway plan, a layaway gram.

06:43.960 --> 06:44.800
There you are.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.160
Listen, it's been a while.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.960
I've been out of the game for a while now

06:48.960 --> 06:51.240
when it comes to singing telegrams for professors,

06:51.240 --> 06:53.880
but $5 seems awfully low, doesn't it?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.880
It seems like not very much money.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.440
I don't think you can buy,

06:57.440 --> 07:00.080
this may be the only thing you can get with $5.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.480
Yeah, a human being is gonna have to use their mouth

07:02.480 --> 07:05.880
to sing in public in front of another human being

07:05.880 --> 07:09.680
who is looking at them for $5?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.760
You could uncut gyms it

07:11.760 --> 07:16.080
and put this three-ski on the horsies, on the ponies,

07:16.080 --> 07:18.760
let it ride, and say like, if they come to you,

07:18.760 --> 07:20.560
like, hey, I do need those quarters back,

07:20.560 --> 07:22.760
you can be like, listen, it's all,

07:22.760 --> 07:24.760
it's not liquid right now.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.000
It's tied up in the ponies, isn't it?

07:28.120 --> 07:29.520
Tell him it's not liquid.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.160
I gave this $3 to the singing guy

07:32.160 --> 07:34.360
as a deposit for him to start learning

07:35.960 --> 07:37.880
the hit song he wanted to sing,

07:37.880 --> 07:40.440
Drops of Jupiter by Trey,

07:40.440 --> 07:44.200
because he's one of those planet professors, you know?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.040
Oh, yeah.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.400
Planetology.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.160
He gets up there day one, he's like,

07:49.160 --> 07:52.320
my very energetic mother just served us nine pizzas.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.520
That's the acronym, and I'll see you guys next year.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.000
You know what's weird about that, Griffin?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.440
It's not pizzas anymore.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.800
We can't talk about fucking Pluto.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.280
Nobody cares about it.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.320
It's a planet. Clearly.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.120
I like it, it's small.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.960
It's a big rock in space, guys.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.200
There's lots of them.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
Not enough.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.120
Would you guys like a singing telegram?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.960
Like, would you like one of that shit up at your place?

08:12.960 --> 08:14.400
Not for me right now,

08:14.400 --> 08:16.520
but like, if you got one in your day-to-day.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.200
I would feel threatened if that happened.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.500
If someone came up to me and said,

08:20.500 --> 08:21.960
hey, I have to tell you something,

08:21.960 --> 08:23.440
and started singing at me,

08:23.440 --> 08:25.520
I don't know that the feeling I would feel

08:25.520 --> 08:28.500
would be one of love or gratitude.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.720
Like, this is the thing, right?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.300
Can we all just be honest with ourselves

08:31.300 --> 08:32.640
that this kind of thing,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.180
or like delivering a big bouquet of balloons,

08:35.180 --> 08:38.560
while part of it, yes, is sweet and thoughtful,

08:38.560 --> 08:41.640
the other half is like, I want to embarrass you a little.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.120
I want to fucking shame you.

08:44.120 --> 08:44.960
Right?

08:44.960 --> 08:47.060
Like that, I'm going to make a big spectacle,

08:47.060 --> 08:48.800
because if you just stand there nodding,

08:48.800 --> 08:50.720
like, yes, I deserve this, and I appreciate it.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.900
Like, that's not how that's supposed to go.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.480
You're supposed to kind of cover your face

08:54.480 --> 08:56.720
and be embarrassed by this thing happening.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.320
Why is that how we're choosing

08:58.320 --> 08:59.880
to show our love to one another?

08:59.880 --> 09:01.480
Yeah, for three dollars.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.480
Let's see what we can,

09:02.480 --> 09:04.200
Huey, what can we do for three dollars?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.680
It's that we can dump a bunch of paint on them.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.720
Do you want that?

09:07.720 --> 09:10.660
We can accidentally squidge some toothpaste on their pants

09:10.660 --> 09:12.800
and make it look like they did have a naughty accident.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.760
Do you like that?

09:15.520 --> 09:16.900
This is embarrassing.

09:16.900 --> 09:21.900
About, probably, oh boy, it's been about 16 years ago.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.240
For the first Valentine's Day, we were together,

09:27.240 --> 09:30.820
my now wife and I, then girlfriend, Sydney.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.100
My now wife?

09:32.100 --> 09:32.940
Nah.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.220
No, you can't, I didn't even open the door to it.

09:35.220 --> 09:36.300
That's actually a bat.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.340
You have to turn around three times

09:38.340 --> 09:40.220
and throw salt over your left shoulder or more,

09:40.220 --> 09:41.920
and it'll kill you in your sleep.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.920
For Valentine's Day, there was this group

09:46.980 --> 09:50.540
that was doing these sorts of things,

09:50.540 --> 09:55.300
but they called it a VLQ, or a very large quartet.

09:55.300 --> 10:00.300
And basically, just a grip of the oldest fellas

10:00.380 --> 10:02.420
you've ever seen in your entire life

10:02.420 --> 10:06.920
show up at a place and sing a song, right?

10:06.920 --> 10:10.540
And it was beautiful, it went perfectly.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.420
Sydney was at rehearsal for a play,

10:12.420 --> 10:15.860
and they showed up at rehearsal and just dazzled,

10:15.860 --> 10:19.660
and it was very romantic, and it was really lovely.

10:20.980 --> 10:25.920
About six months ago, I started thinking,

10:25.920 --> 10:27.540
did I pay those guys?

10:28.500 --> 10:32.700
It was not a money up, hold on, don't rush to judge it.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.140
It was not a money up front kind of deal,

10:35.140 --> 10:40.140
it was you do it and make a little deposit,

10:40.140 --> 10:43.460
and then we'll do the singing

10:43.460 --> 10:46.500
and you can make it right later.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.860
That's a bad business model, old dudes, by the way.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.380
Yeah, but they're so old and trusting.

10:52.380 --> 10:56.640
So I did this, and I got to thinking about six months ago,

10:56.640 --> 10:59.260
I never paid these fucking guys for this thing.

10:59.260 --> 11:03.140
And then I started thinking, I gotta make this right.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.340
I can get it liquid.

11:04.340 --> 11:09.100
I can get it liquid, however much it costs,

11:09.100 --> 11:10.380
and then I started thinking,

11:10.380 --> 11:11.900
this was unpleasant to consider,

11:11.900 --> 11:15.600
but most of those guys are probably,

11:17.140 --> 11:18.680
but a lot of them are probably dead,

11:18.680 --> 11:21.140
and that is when I started to feel really bad,

11:21.140 --> 11:23.660
because at this point, I'd be paying money

11:23.660 --> 11:27.420
to their sons, their singing sons.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.500
Their estates, kicking in a few bucks here and there.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.020
Or it might be a tontine situation,

11:33.020 --> 11:35.580
where the very large quartet has just been saving

11:35.580 --> 11:39.180
all the money that they make, and the last one kicking,

11:39.180 --> 11:41.580
which will probably be the baron's son, let's be honest.

11:41.580 --> 11:44.900
The only source of income the surviving members

11:44.900 --> 11:46.580
of this group need to worry about

11:46.580 --> 11:51.060
is Justin's unpaid deposit, plus the juice.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.920
Oh yeah, the juice has been flowing.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.700
My man, we're talking six figures, bud.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.860
Their page is still active.

11:59.860 --> 12:01.700
I mean, their website is still active,

12:01.700 --> 12:04.140
but there's no online option.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.420
So I would have to come, I would have to make a phone call

12:07.420 --> 12:09.900
that's like, hello, this is Justin McElroy.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.260
You probably know me from how they talked about me

12:12.260 --> 12:13.940
at the meetings for a decade,

12:13.940 --> 12:16.900
but how's the juice right now?

12:16.900 --> 12:18.820
Do you want us to sit here on the phone,

12:18.820 --> 12:21.460
on the call with you while you call them?

12:21.460 --> 12:23.140
We'll be here for emotional support if you want.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.380
Oh, that could be really good.

12:25.380 --> 12:26.740
That would be a really special thing

12:26.740 --> 12:28.740
for the Max Fun Drive episode.

12:28.740 --> 12:29.780
Yeah, okay, hold on.

12:31.380 --> 12:32.380
All right, but hold on.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.540
This can't be our prank episode.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.580
Travis, you and I have to button it the fuck up, dude.

12:36.580 --> 12:37.420
Yep, yep, yep.

12:37.420 --> 12:41.580
Can you guys talk about that for a second while I do this?

12:41.580 --> 12:43.900
And let's have Justin do a very good phone call

12:43.900 --> 12:46.340
while me and Travis really button it up.

12:46.340 --> 12:47.180
Hello?

12:48.100 --> 12:51.900
Hi, I had a question regarding the Thundertones.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.940
Yes, what would you like to know?

12:53.940 --> 12:57.960
Well, okay, I didn't think anybody would answer,

12:57.960 --> 13:02.260
so I'm a little nervous, but in, I think it was-

13:02.260 --> 13:03.820
No reason to be nervous.

13:03.820 --> 13:05.780
Well, you haven't heard, okay.

13:05.780 --> 13:10.780
So in 2005, you all did a singing telegram

13:11.140 --> 13:14.820
for my, she was my girlfriend then,

13:14.820 --> 13:17.420
and she's my wife now.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.180
She was very touched by it,

13:19.180 --> 13:21.740
and I realized about six months ago

13:21.740 --> 13:23.300
that I never paid for it,

13:23.300 --> 13:25.180
and I feel really, really bad about it,

13:25.180 --> 13:27.060
and I have for quite some time,

13:27.060 --> 13:29.400
and I know that there's juice on it.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.460
I know the interest has been collecting for many years.

13:32.460 --> 13:34.780
I'm sure you all have been talking about it a lot,

13:34.780 --> 13:37.420
and I just wanted to make it right and get-

13:37.420 --> 13:39.360
It's up to $3,000.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.720
No, that's not true.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.900
I was not in the group at that time,

13:44.900 --> 13:46.900
and I don't even know what kind of record.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.620
We don't have any records, I don't think,

13:48.620 --> 13:53.140
that go that far, or if we do, they're so buried.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.580
I will tell you this.

13:55.580 --> 14:00.220
If you want to make that right, just so your conscience

14:00.220 --> 14:04.180
will be soothed, you may send a check.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.820
Let's see, 2005, do you remember how much it was for?

14:07.820 --> 14:09.140
Because it's now $50.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.220
I don't know what they were back then.

14:11.220 --> 14:14.340
I mean, $50 sounds, that sounds more than fair.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.540
There was a whole lot of people there.

14:16.540 --> 14:19.740
I mean, there was a VLQ, they called it,

14:19.740 --> 14:22.580
a very large quartet, which is a good joke.

14:22.580 --> 14:23.400
Oh, okay.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.900
And $50 sounds fair, but if you want it to be more,

14:26.900 --> 14:27.980
I mean, I feel so terrible.

14:27.980 --> 14:31.180
You really got me over a barrel on this one.

14:31.180 --> 14:32.460
No, not at all.

14:32.460 --> 14:36.940
I appreciate your honesty, and that is no problem at all.

14:36.940 --> 14:41.940
Why don't you just send a $50 check to the Thundertones,

14:43.460 --> 14:46.380
make it out to the Thundertones,

14:46.380 --> 14:49.220
and just send it to my address.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.500
I'm the president of the group.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.060
My name is, but you don't need to know that.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.620
Just make out the check to the Thundertones,

14:56.620 --> 14:59.860
and then my address is as follows.

14:59.860 --> 15:04.300
I will thank you so much.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.900
I really appreciate you letting me get my conscience clear.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.540
I feel like a new chapter has begun,

15:10.540 --> 15:14.460
and I'm ready to move forward with a clean conscience.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.620
I mean, for this, there's lots of other terrible things,

15:16.620 --> 15:19.680
but for this one thing, I feel better about.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.420
I was gonna say, now you can go back

15:21.420 --> 15:23.340
and return all those books that you checked out

15:23.340 --> 15:25.220
of the library that you never returned.

15:25.220 --> 15:30.220
So, thank you very much for your patronage.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.500
By the way, we just finished that up,

15:33.500 --> 15:37.940
and we did 38 Valentines this year.

15:37.940 --> 15:39.460
Had two quartets go out.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.260
It was very successful.

15:41.260 --> 15:43.460
Keep us in mind for next year,

15:43.460 --> 15:47.460
and I'm sure that she wouldn't remind a reprieve

15:47.460 --> 15:48.820
on something like that.

15:48.820 --> 15:51.620
I love that you can trust me again.

15:51.620 --> 15:54.780
History is not on my side.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.660
I'm impressed that you're willing to forgive and forget.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.140
Well, that is no problem at all.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.580
I wasn't expecting it in the first place,

16:01.580 --> 16:03.660
and like I said, we don't have a record of it,

16:03.660 --> 16:04.500
so don't worry about that.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.220
But hey, y'all must be rolling in it now, though.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.580
38 times 50, I'm loving that math.

16:09.580 --> 16:13.020
Well, I tell you what, it is our largest fundraiser.

16:13.020 --> 16:15.580
Even we make more off this than we do

16:15.580 --> 16:18.580
even our annual show that we do in the fall.

16:18.580 --> 16:21.780
Is that one spookier, kind of a scary thing,

16:21.780 --> 16:24.980
lots of like haunted jump scares and stuff like that?

16:24.980 --> 16:27.900
We did, no, no, we did one of those.

16:27.900 --> 16:31.020
We did a show that was kind of had that theme,

16:31.020 --> 16:33.300
but no, it varies from year to year,

16:33.300 --> 16:36.220
and recently we've been going with songs

16:36.220 --> 16:39.140
that are songs that everybody's familiar with.

16:39.140 --> 16:40.940
This last one was the British Invasion,

16:40.940 --> 16:45.300
and we did a bunch from Beatles and Herman's Hermits

16:45.300 --> 16:48.340
and stuff like that, so it's a lot of fun.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.500
And if you sing, heck, come by and see us.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.300
Okay, I'll give you just a sample

16:53.300 --> 16:54.460
and let me know what you think.

16:54.460 --> 16:58.140
Stay a while with me,

16:58.140 --> 17:02.980
just stick around and see what happens,

17:02.980 --> 17:07.380
what will be, will be,

17:07.380 --> 17:08.780
and wills. We can work with that.

17:08.780 --> 17:10.340
Yeah, we can work with that, that's excellent.

17:10.340 --> 17:13.700
Hey, Rick, you've been so cool, thank you so much.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.620
My brothers put me up to this.

17:15.620 --> 17:18.700
I told them this story and they forced me to call

17:18.700 --> 17:22.140
for our podcast, and you will,

17:22.140 --> 17:25.580
that check will be rolling your way here in a couple days.

17:25.580 --> 17:26.540
Tell me your name.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.220
Justin McElroy.

17:28.220 --> 17:30.500
Justin McElroy, well, thank you very much, Justin.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.220
I'll look forward to that check and that amount.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.940
And also, give me your contact information as well.

17:37.940 --> 17:41.100
Yes, now this is for the lawsuit, isn't it?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.940
Because I've had the juice running too long.

17:42.940 --> 17:46.420
All right, thanks, Rick, take it easy.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.980
Okay, you too, thank you, Justin, appreciate it.

17:48.980 --> 17:49.820
Bye-bye.

17:49.820 --> 17:54.900
No, no, no, no, you just got pranked, baby!

17:54.900 --> 17:57.220
I can't believe they had forgotten about it.

17:57.220 --> 17:58.900
No, Justin, they didn't.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.540
I can't believe Rick acted like he had forgotten about it

18:01.540 --> 18:03.300
so convincingly.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.860
Yeah, and did you also hear how when you gave him your name

18:06.860 --> 18:08.420
with a little bit of a smile,

18:08.420 --> 18:13.220
as if he was then gonna be like, oh, damn, Justin McElroy?

18:13.220 --> 18:15.500
And then there was no recognition at all,

18:15.500 --> 18:18.940
and I got a shiver down my spine.

18:18.940 --> 18:20.340
I didn't think he'd be like,

18:20.340 --> 18:22.860
oh, shit, Justin McElroy from podcasts.

18:22.860 --> 18:25.660
I literally thought he was looking for a list

18:25.660 --> 18:27.100
of like shitheads.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.100
I expected him to remember me from the shithead list.

18:30.100 --> 18:30.940
Yeah, when he said Justin McElroy.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.380
What, do you think he's a fucking

18:32.380 --> 18:34.540
Things I Bought at Sheets fan?

18:34.540 --> 18:39.540
I was expecting Rick to be a fan of my YouTube series.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.260
Come on.

18:41.260 --> 18:42.500
When you said Justin McElroy,

18:42.500 --> 18:45.700
he just reached over to the notepad in his passenger seat

18:45.700 --> 18:49.220
and marked off your name under people I need to kill.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.060
Yeah.

18:50.060 --> 18:52.780
There's also, he's from Huntington.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.780
If I said my name, it was not that he would know me.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.460
It was probably that thinking that he'd know my dad

18:58.460 --> 19:00.580
and would say like, oh, this fucking figures.

19:00.580 --> 19:03.100
Hey, you're gonna like bleep out his address and stuff,

19:03.100 --> 19:04.860
right, so we don't box Rick.

19:04.860 --> 19:05.700
I hope so, I hope so.

19:05.700 --> 19:06.900
Ooh, I hope so.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.780
But sometimes I don't pay very close attention

19:08.780 --> 19:09.620
to these, don't I?

19:09.620 --> 19:11.380
Hey, maybe this could become like a new segment

19:11.380 --> 19:13.100
where Justin just clears his conscience

19:13.100 --> 19:15.340
like one thing at a time.

19:15.340 --> 19:17.460
Even out the closet, I like that.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.080
Only bad thing I ever did, though.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.020
That's the only one.

19:20.020 --> 19:20.900
Okay.

19:20.900 --> 19:21.860
Hey, I've got a Yahoo here.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.020
Do you wanna hear it?

19:23.020 --> 19:23.860
Sure.

19:23.860 --> 19:24.680
Sent in by Jeanette.

19:24.680 --> 19:25.520
Thanks, Jeanette.

19:25.520 --> 19:26.360
It's Yahoo Answers user.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.780
Oh, they're anonymous.

19:27.780 --> 19:28.620
They're anonymous.

19:28.620 --> 19:29.460
It was Rick.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.060
It was Rick asks,

19:31.060 --> 19:36.060
should the queen move to America to get a new experience?

19:36.280 --> 19:37.120
Yes.

19:40.460 --> 19:41.300
I know.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.380
Thank you.

19:42.380 --> 19:47.380
I know so very little about the monarchy or anything.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.820
Really, government.

19:50.820 --> 19:54.760
To speak of, worldly speaking.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.920
So this may be coming from an uneducated place.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.240
In fact, I can confirm it is,

20:00.240 --> 20:03.580
but it seems like maybe if the queen came to America,

20:03.580 --> 20:05.300
she could have a new experience.

20:05.300 --> 20:08.180
Not just came here, not just came here to visit.

20:08.180 --> 20:10.700
Got a flat, you know?

20:11.660 --> 20:14.940
Took a Lyft, but we call them elevators.

20:14.940 --> 20:15.780
Lyft.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.220
Oh, well, I thought you were talking about rental car.

20:18.220 --> 20:19.920
Oh, no, we call those cars.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.860
Yeah, or buggies, lorries, whatever.

20:22.860 --> 20:25.500
Maybe she started calling them different shit, right?

20:25.500 --> 20:26.340
Yeah.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.500
Yeah, what if she went back to Britain

20:28.500 --> 20:30.140
and was just like, hey, from now on,

20:30.140 --> 20:34.340
we're calling them elevators and apartments and shrimp.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.460
Enough of this shit, right?

20:36.460 --> 20:39.800
Sorry, I bumped my shopping cart into your shopping cart.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.100
And that's what we now call them.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.700
Look, there's a truck.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.100
Bring me some cookies.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.480
And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

20:46.480 --> 20:48.460
I'm going to behead you.

20:48.460 --> 20:51.660
Hey, can I ask you guys a for real serious question?

20:51.660 --> 20:52.500
Uh-huh.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.580
I'm sure that there's like, you know,

20:54.580 --> 20:57.060
some courtesies extended to her

20:57.060 --> 20:59.260
and like diplomatic immunity and stuff,

20:59.260 --> 21:02.540
but if the queen were to come to the US of A

21:02.540 --> 21:04.860
and I were to offend her,

21:04.860 --> 21:07.300
she's got no power over me, right?

21:07.300 --> 21:09.940
Like she couldn't get me in trouble.

21:09.940 --> 21:10.780
No.

21:10.780 --> 21:13.580
I mean, okay, she could get you in trouble, probably,

21:13.580 --> 21:16.820
if she told an adult or a teacher.

21:16.820 --> 21:17.660
Okay.

21:17.660 --> 21:21.020
But not like in Britain where I didn't bow right

21:21.020 --> 21:23.620
and now I'm going to go to prison or something.

21:23.620 --> 21:24.700
Right, right.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.500
You know, I made that joke about the queen

21:26.500 --> 21:27.460
having someone beheaded

21:27.460 --> 21:29.340
for not knowing what cookies are.

21:29.340 --> 21:30.940
And maybe you start to think about something.

21:30.940 --> 21:31.780
Okay.

21:31.780 --> 21:34.340
Back like several hundred years ago,

21:34.340 --> 21:38.020
the queen could definitely have someone beheaded

21:38.020 --> 21:38.860
if she felt like it.

21:38.860 --> 21:39.700
No doubt.

21:39.700 --> 21:40.520
We agree on this, right?

21:40.520 --> 21:41.360
Definitely.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.900
Today, the queen would say like off with her head

21:44.900 --> 21:47.700
and everybody would be like, I don't think so, right?

21:47.700 --> 21:51.660
So my question is this, the last time that happened,

21:51.660 --> 21:55.620
do you think there was a sense of like, been a good run,

21:55.620 --> 21:57.940
but I think this is the last one.

21:57.940 --> 22:00.900
I think we're wrapping up on being able to do,

22:00.900 --> 22:04.320
this has been extremely satisfying and fun,

22:04.320 --> 22:05.820
but I think we are wrapping,

22:05.820 --> 22:08.460
like the last one must have felt pretty bad

22:08.460 --> 22:10.080
for everybody to be like,

22:10.080 --> 22:13.100
I don't think we do this anymore, actually.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.860
I don't think it was a switch flip, Jamie.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.300
I don't think it was like, oh, you know what?

22:17.300 --> 22:18.140
I don't want to do it.

22:18.140 --> 22:20.540
I think it was more of like a fade out

22:20.540 --> 22:21.540
of just like over time,

22:21.540 --> 22:23.820
people were getting less and less okay with it.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.220
And then there was one where it was kind of a squeaker

22:26.220 --> 22:28.100
where I was like, ooh, are we gonna?

22:28.100 --> 22:28.940
Ooh, yikes.

22:28.940 --> 22:29.780
Ooh, are we gonna do it?

22:29.780 --> 22:31.340
And the person's in the guillotine and they're like,

22:31.340 --> 22:33.500
this feels unnecessary to me.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.700
You all agree, right?

22:34.700 --> 22:36.500
We probably shouldn't.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.340
We should do jail.

22:38.340 --> 22:40.860
Hey, what do you guys think about jail?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.300
We got them.

22:42.300 --> 22:46.020
It's not perfect, but I think it might be better than this.

22:46.020 --> 22:47.660
I think instead of a fade out, Travis,

22:47.660 --> 22:50.940
I think it's possible that there was a sort of crescendo

22:50.940 --> 22:52.620
where there was one day where they just beheaded

22:52.620 --> 22:54.500
like so many people and they're like,

22:54.500 --> 22:56.940
it's not even fun anymore.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.300
Like, I can't, I don't even feel it.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.500
It's like jazz, you know?

23:00.500 --> 23:02.660
What's fun is the beheadings you don't do.

23:02.660 --> 23:03.540
Right.

23:03.540 --> 23:06.220
Because that's, think of the joy on someone's face

23:06.220 --> 23:07.980
when you get them into the guillotine

23:07.980 --> 23:09.380
and like they're blindfolded or something

23:09.380 --> 23:10.980
and you go like, do it.

23:10.980 --> 23:14.300
And like, you have the sound of like a lever going

23:14.300 --> 23:16.140
and like a sound of a thunk over there.

23:16.140 --> 23:18.380
But then you're like, hey, guess what?

23:18.380 --> 23:20.540
You're not gonna get beheaded.

23:20.540 --> 23:21.380
That's fun.

23:21.380 --> 23:23.820
That person's never gonna do something wrong ever again.

23:23.820 --> 23:27.340
It's basically the premise of Undercover Boss.

23:27.340 --> 23:29.700
Yeah, it's exactly like Undercover Boss.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.060
A friend and I often work together during class

23:32.060 --> 23:33.500
and I wanna ask for his number

23:33.500 --> 23:35.940
so if I have any questions, I can just text him.

23:35.940 --> 23:38.060
However, I don't want him to get the wrong idea

23:38.060 --> 23:39.120
and think that I'm getting his number

23:39.120 --> 23:42.020
for any sort of romantic purpose or ulterior motive.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.380
What is a completely normal way to ask for someone's number

23:45.380 --> 23:47.600
without perpetuating the wrong idea?

23:48.660 --> 23:49.860
That's from Gmail.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.340
You cannot do this.

23:51.340 --> 23:53.220
Don't even try.

23:53.220 --> 23:54.420
Griffin is right.

23:54.420 --> 23:55.980
You just can't do it.

23:55.980 --> 24:00.060
It's not, it's not, this is very relatable

24:00.060 --> 24:02.000
because I had this exact scenario

24:02.000 --> 24:06.140
and it's just, it's not, it's just not possible,

24:06.140 --> 24:07.460
I don't think, right?

24:07.460 --> 24:09.940
We can all agree that anytime you've ever had to say

24:09.940 --> 24:13.060
to another human being like, can I get your number?

24:13.060 --> 24:16.580
It's so hard and it's so much, I would argue,

24:16.580 --> 24:20.900
harder to say when it is not for romantic intent, right?

24:20.900 --> 24:23.820
Because then you worry, you have to then explain yourself

24:23.820 --> 24:28.460
and say like, in case you wanna play video games together,

24:28.460 --> 24:29.620
I don't wanna smooch.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.460
Do you know what's fucked up?

24:31.460 --> 24:34.700
And this is, I genuinely cannot answer this.

24:35.960 --> 24:39.800
If I asked for, you know, if I was in college or whatever

24:39.800 --> 24:43.100
and needed to get in contact with somebody

24:43.100 --> 24:44.820
that I was like working with on something,

24:44.820 --> 24:49.820
I would feel zero pressure to ask for their email address.

24:50.140 --> 24:53.320
But it's still like, it's still like talking, innit?

24:53.320 --> 24:56.380
So like, why does that, why is phone just like

24:56.380 --> 24:58.260
the sexy one, I guess?

24:58.260 --> 24:59.100
Yeah, I don't know.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.580
I think it's because of the connotation of like,

25:00.580 --> 25:01.780
can I get your number?

25:01.780 --> 25:03.440
Yeah, but I think there's more to that.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.220
In this modern era, I think that it's because

25:06.220 --> 25:09.060
it's so private, like I don't even know

25:09.060 --> 25:11.380
your guys' phone numbers, you know?

25:11.380 --> 25:13.380
Like, it's extremely private.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.140
I definitely gave you my phone number.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.220
My phone knows it, but I don't know.

25:17.220 --> 25:18.860
Yeah, my phone knows it.

25:18.860 --> 25:21.660
I don't know it, so it's private to you.

25:21.660 --> 25:22.500
You know what I'm saying?

25:22.500 --> 25:23.740
It's a private thing.

25:23.740 --> 25:25.460
Yeah, but I'm gonna stick with my point

25:25.460 --> 25:27.780
because I've never seen a movie where somebody

25:27.780 --> 25:30.320
like looked at their friend across the table at a bar

25:30.320 --> 25:35.320
and like cockily said like, she friended me on Facebook.

25:35.340 --> 25:37.660
I mean, that's what You've Got Mail is about,

25:37.660 --> 25:39.740
so what are you saying?

25:39.740 --> 25:44.520
And the second thing, maybe it's just that the phone,

25:44.520 --> 25:48.780
with the phone, it is intimate because you're saying,

25:48.780 --> 25:52.260
give me the buttons to press on my phone

25:52.260 --> 25:56.040
so that I may gently nestle your warm voice

25:56.040 --> 25:57.520
close to my face.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.540
There's really no way to talk to somebody on the phone

26:00.540 --> 26:02.420
without confining the fact that you're doing whispers

26:02.420 --> 26:04.740
into each other, like directly into each other's ear,

26:04.740 --> 26:06.140
basically. Now that's fair.

26:06.140 --> 26:06.980
That is fair.

26:06.980 --> 26:10.420
Well, you also, I think there's an immediacy to this

26:10.420 --> 26:12.860
of like, give me your phone number.

26:12.860 --> 26:16.180
That's like saying like, hey, if I need help with school,

26:16.180 --> 26:20.780
I want you to, the second that it crosses my mind,

26:20.780 --> 26:22.700
I want you on fucking call.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.740
I don't wanna send an email that you'll respond to

26:24.740 --> 26:26.300
in a couple of hours.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.740
I wanna know that you know I need you then.

26:29.740 --> 26:32.200
Here, it's 2020, it's 2020.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.400
Can I pitch an idea that you've just given me, Justin?

26:35.400 --> 26:36.740
Every phone.

26:36.740 --> 26:38.700
Wait, hold on, you didn't even let me think about it.

26:38.700 --> 26:39.540
Okay.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.140
Yeah.

26:42.140 --> 26:44.780
Okay, every phone should have two numbers.

26:44.780 --> 26:47.860
One that you can call and one that you can text,

26:47.860 --> 26:50.900
and you should like only give out the one that can text

26:50.900 --> 26:52.780
and reserve the one that can call for like,

26:52.780 --> 26:57.580
if you are dying, you are allowed to use this number.

26:57.580 --> 26:58.580
That's great.

26:58.580 --> 26:59.940
That's great, Travis, because you set

26:59.940 --> 27:02.420
Drops of Jupiter by train as your ringtone,

27:02.420 --> 27:04.400
and then you're out at dinner with your friends,

27:04.400 --> 27:06.620
and you hear, now she's back in the air.

27:06.620 --> 27:08.320
And you gotta be like, oh shit,

27:08.320 --> 27:10.260
something happened with my uncle.

27:10.260 --> 27:11.660
Oh shit.

27:11.660 --> 27:14.420
Oh no, my dad, I gotta go.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.260
Yep.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.160
As I understand it, though,

27:16.160 --> 27:19.100
this is already how people are using phone.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.260
No one calls on phone, right?

27:21.260 --> 27:22.100
Yes, right.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.460
This draws the line, though.

27:24.460 --> 27:27.940
Instead of getting a friend's number to work on homework,

27:27.940 --> 27:29.140
you got the number all at once.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.220
What if you did it in stages,

27:31.220 --> 27:34.420
where you're like, okay, I'm comfortable enough with you

27:34.420 --> 27:37.420
to so far give you my area code?

27:37.420 --> 27:38.260
Yeah.

27:38.260 --> 27:39.300
We're doing it, right?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.140
That's good.

27:40.140 --> 27:42.740
That way it doesn't feel like a commitment yet.

27:42.740 --> 27:45.120
The real answer to this is, you know,

27:45.120 --> 27:47.780
you gotta reel in a third person into this,

27:47.780 --> 27:49.840
and be like, hey, we should all exchange numbers.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.460
That's great.

27:51.460 --> 27:52.660
That's powerful.

27:52.660 --> 27:54.580
Maybe just plan a big group hang

27:54.580 --> 27:57.300
to all go see that new movie together.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.580
We'll work on the paper at some point.

28:00.580 --> 28:04.740
Hey, you guys like Outback Steakhouse?

28:04.740 --> 28:06.580
Yeah, maybe we can work on it.

28:06.580 --> 28:08.220
I was just walking by.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.780
I'm not even in your class.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.200
We should all exchange numbers,

28:11.200 --> 28:12.420
the three of us, equally.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.260
The same number.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.080
Who are you?

28:14.080 --> 28:14.920
Yeah.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.900
Here is the best advice.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.180
Okay, I've got this.

28:18.180 --> 28:19.020
Okay.

28:19.020 --> 28:21.380
You need to give them your phone number,

28:21.380 --> 28:24.740
and give them a reason to reach out to you

28:24.740 --> 28:27.380
that is not romantic, okay?

28:27.380 --> 28:28.220
Picture this.

28:28.220 --> 28:29.060
If you ever need a break.

28:29.060 --> 28:30.580
This is like toilet paper.

28:30.580 --> 28:31.980
You walk up to this person.

28:31.980 --> 28:35.300
You'd be like, hey, listen, I'm not spreading this around,

28:35.300 --> 28:38.380
but I got a fucking choice sourdough starter

28:38.380 --> 28:40.780
that I would love to slice you off a bit of.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.460
Here is my phone number.

28:42.460 --> 28:44.320
Here is an empty jar.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.140
Let your imagination run wild

28:46.140 --> 28:49.380
of how a little sourdough starter would look in here.

28:49.380 --> 28:51.780
The price, that's not between friends.

28:51.780 --> 28:53.420
We're not gonna worry about that.

28:53.420 --> 28:55.540
But you go ahead and give me a text to Rooski,

28:55.540 --> 28:57.460
and this beautiful bread baby

28:57.460 --> 29:00.100
could be headed to your house, a media mente.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.020
And then the cool thing about that is

29:02.020 --> 29:05.860
you get their number, and they owe you

29:05.860 --> 29:08.860
for the sourdough that you hooked them up with that one time.

29:08.860 --> 29:10.660
Okay, Justin, just to clarify,

29:10.660 --> 29:14.580
just so I don't do this wrong when I attempt this,

29:14.580 --> 29:19.140
do I need to actually have a sourdough starter to use this?

29:19.140 --> 29:22.420
Travis, if you do not have a sourdough starter,

29:22.420 --> 29:25.100
they will assume you are American Psycho 2 this week.

29:25.100 --> 29:30.020
There is fucking no reality

29:30.020 --> 29:33.260
in which you cannot also have a sourdough starter

29:33.260 --> 29:37.460
on hand, ancient grains ready to rip,

29:37.460 --> 29:41.460
ready to turn that beautiful sugar into carbon dioxide

29:41.460 --> 29:44.460
and crank that bread up to its maximum fluffy potential.

29:44.460 --> 29:46.740
Now here's the thing, I do have a sourdough starter.

29:46.740 --> 29:49.300
I just don't know if I'm ready to give it away.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.580
Like that just seems like such a big commitment.

29:51.580 --> 29:54.740
I think this works on the platonic level, yes, Justin.

29:54.740 --> 29:57.660
Can we tweak it a little bit for a different person

29:57.660 --> 29:59.980
who wants it for a romantic level?

29:59.980 --> 30:04.260
At the bar, hanging out, someone catches your eye.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.380
Can you wander over there with an empty jar

30:06.380 --> 30:08.380
and a promise of fermentation?

30:08.380 --> 30:11.180
I think in that case, the sourdough starter

30:11.180 --> 30:12.980
has to already be in the jar.

30:12.980 --> 30:15.580
And you just say, I'm like, if you wanna know more,

30:15.580 --> 30:16.580
give me a call.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.980
My number is written on the sourdough starter.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.100
They're not gonna buy the baker

30:20.100 --> 30:23.100
when they got the starter for free, you know?

30:23.100 --> 30:25.620
Maybe you have a nine out of 10

30:25.620 --> 30:27.740
of the sourdough starter ingredients in there.

30:27.740 --> 30:30.060
And you're like, the missing piece is me.

30:30.060 --> 30:32.300
Give me a call and we'll start something together

30:32.300 --> 30:35.100
and feel the power of sour and let the dough flow.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.900
Not how sourdough starters work, but okay.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.580
I don't know anything.

30:38.580 --> 30:40.420
Yeah, that's kind of thematic.

30:40.420 --> 30:41.740
Yeah.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.540
Yeah, how about a Yahoo?

30:43.540 --> 30:44.380
Yeah, I love that.

30:44.380 --> 30:46.380
This one was sent in by level9000.

30:46.380 --> 30:49.300
Yadru drew a drew to have important thank you drew.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.460
It's from Yadru answers user.

30:51.460 --> 30:53.780
They're anonymous.

30:53.780 --> 30:57.300
So let's call them Jamothy asks,

30:57.300 --> 31:01.460
why do Siberian tigers need to be so huge?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.420
Their prey seems much smaller.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.940
They need to fight Kodiak bears.

31:05.940 --> 31:07.140
Huh.

31:07.140 --> 31:10.620
So I don't know enough about, I think,

31:10.620 --> 31:14.580
animals in general to answer why the Siberian tiger,

31:14.580 --> 31:18.940
like what environmental sort of like challenges

31:18.940 --> 31:21.780
they had to overcome by becoming just fucking jacked,

31:21.780 --> 31:23.180
these Siberian tigers.

31:24.140 --> 31:26.900
But I'm extremely here for the idea

31:26.900 --> 31:31.460
that the Siberian tiger, big and powerful and beautiful

31:32.700 --> 31:37.700
could challenge itself a little bit, like more.

31:40.060 --> 31:45.060
Like it's going after small rodents and rabbits

31:45.060 --> 31:50.060
and probably unlucky birds, unlucky slow birds.

31:51.340 --> 31:52.500
Yeah.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.460
Or just like sleepy birds.

31:54.460 --> 31:59.140
Sleepy birds, unfortunate explorer, adventurer.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.260
Whatever beef it finds on the ground just laying around.

32:01.260 --> 32:02.340
Just random beef.

32:02.340 --> 32:03.180
Ground beef.

32:03.180 --> 32:04.020
Ground beef.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.780
Yes.

32:05.780 --> 32:06.820
But you know what,

32:06.820 --> 32:08.780
and I think about this all the time with Gryven?

32:08.780 --> 32:09.620
No.

32:09.620 --> 32:10.960
The panda.

32:10.960 --> 32:11.800
Well, okay.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.300
Panda, well, hear me out.

32:13.300 --> 32:14.140
Okay.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.300
It's just eating bamboo.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.500
It's not built to do that.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.260
It should be eating meat.

32:19.260 --> 32:20.560
That is a bear, huh?

32:20.560 --> 32:22.100
That's why it's sleepy all the time

32:22.100 --> 32:23.240
and does so very little

32:23.240 --> 32:25.340
and doesn't really have the power

32:25.340 --> 32:26.980
or the energy to make love

32:26.980 --> 32:29.220
because it's so sleepy all the time.

32:29.220 --> 32:32.340
And so at some point a panda must've been chasing

32:32.340 --> 32:34.420
like a bird or a rabbit or something

32:34.420 --> 32:36.700
and be like, this fucking sucks.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.780
That plant is just sitting there.

32:38.780 --> 32:41.420
I'm gonna eat that from now on.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.540
There's so much of it everywhere.

32:43.540 --> 32:45.340
What if that was food?

32:45.340 --> 32:48.140
I'm just gonna sit here and do shit all

32:48.140 --> 32:51.780
and eat this stick and not bone anymore.

32:51.780 --> 32:52.620
That's the problem.

32:52.620 --> 32:53.700
Pandas aren't boning.

32:53.700 --> 32:54.960
So the numbers are going down.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.660
If we could get one,

32:56.660 --> 32:58.460
just fucking battle horny,

32:58.460 --> 33:01.680
come back from defeating the huge Siberian tiger,

33:01.680 --> 33:04.260
which there are billions of probably.

33:04.260 --> 33:06.540
You know, an unlikely victory.

33:06.540 --> 33:08.240
And it comes back home and they're like,

33:08.240 --> 33:10.900
oh shit, Ron, what's up?

33:10.900 --> 33:12.540
You look like heck.

33:12.540 --> 33:16.820
And then Ron can be like, oh, I'm different now.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.420
Who's ready for Ron?

33:18.420 --> 33:20.900
And then they would fucking pork,

33:20.900 --> 33:22.920
like they've never porked before.

33:24.260 --> 33:26.220
And then like all of a sudden pandas are back

33:26.220 --> 33:27.060
and they are-

33:27.060 --> 33:27.880
There's too many.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.860
They're like pigeons and squirrels.

33:29.860 --> 33:32.660
Squirrels, pigeons for all the,

33:32.660 --> 33:34.300
you can talk shit about pigeons,

33:34.300 --> 33:37.380
but pigeons are out there, aren't they?

33:37.380 --> 33:39.180
The pigeons are working out there

33:39.180 --> 33:44.180
and they are up against forces that are so hysterically

33:45.340 --> 33:46.580
beyond their control.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.500
Like what ass can a pigeon kick?

33:48.500 --> 33:49.820
Probably not any.

33:49.820 --> 33:53.980
So they go and they like sit on the third rail of a subway

33:53.980 --> 33:56.720
and they get like totally just bamboozled out there.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.900
And then they fly home to their nest

33:57.900 --> 33:59.980
and it's like, oh shit, rough day in the city.

33:59.980 --> 34:01.860
And they're like, yeah, it was a rough day in the city.

34:01.860 --> 34:03.260
I'm battle horny.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.660
Now let's go.

34:06.660 --> 34:10.780
Has anyone told pigeons that like 10 miles that way

34:10.780 --> 34:12.620
is probably just a bunch of corn

34:12.620 --> 34:15.220
that they don't like have to just be there

34:15.220 --> 34:16.740
in the middle of New York city?

34:16.740 --> 34:18.900
Do you think of a pigeon like heard someone mention

34:18.900 --> 34:20.500
like they're just fields of corn?

34:20.500 --> 34:22.220
They'd be like, what the fuck?

34:22.220 --> 34:24.940
Travis's been like mistaking cigarette butts for food

34:24.940 --> 34:26.780
for the last like 30 years.

34:26.780 --> 34:28.420
For the last 30 generations.

34:28.420 --> 34:30.180
Travis, farmers are listening to this right now,

34:30.180 --> 34:34.300
like sweating, like please don't tell pigeons about farms.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.140
Please no.

34:35.140 --> 34:37.980
Please don't tell pigeons about my farm.

34:38.940 --> 34:40.380
Hey, where did all the tomatoes go?

34:40.380 --> 34:41.460
We had them last night.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.460
Let's look outside.

34:42.460 --> 34:45.980
Uh oh, it's two million pigeons.

34:45.980 --> 34:49.940
They're all just here now looking for statues to sit on.

34:49.940 --> 34:51.620
Do you think pigeons in the city

34:51.620 --> 34:54.540
regularly get letters from their country cousins?

34:54.540 --> 34:57.120
They're like, well, shit still sucks out here

34:57.120 --> 34:59.760
in the country, fucking nothing to eat.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.220
I wish I was living it up with you

35:01.220 --> 35:04.540
eating one fourth of a hot dog butt out of a gutter.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.060
God, that sounds good.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.220
Anyway, yeah, it's all bullshit out here.

35:09.220 --> 35:10.360
Yeah, anyway, I gotta go.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.540
I gotta use the bathroom.

35:12.540 --> 35:14.780
I mean, look for food.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.160
Yeah.

35:17.160 --> 35:17.980
That's all I get to do.

35:17.980 --> 35:18.820
Man, I'm just gonna be thinking,

35:18.820 --> 35:22.140
everybody's talking about unlikely animal pairings.

35:22.140 --> 35:26.060
And when they say that traditionally, they mean friendships.

35:26.060 --> 35:29.940
I'm thinking about it like top 10 anime battles.

35:30.820 --> 35:32.780
Because Kodiak Bear versus Siberian Tiger,

35:32.780 --> 35:35.140
boy, that would be one for the ages, wouldn't it?

35:35.140 --> 35:36.580
That'd be pretty good.

35:36.580 --> 35:38.400
The problem with Jamothy's question is like,

35:38.400 --> 35:39.940
once you start going down the road of like,

35:39.940 --> 35:41.820
why is that tiger so big?

35:41.820 --> 35:44.260
You do that with pretty much every animal.

35:44.260 --> 35:47.900
But like if that animal is smaller, it could eat less food.

35:47.900 --> 35:49.780
Yeah, that's a good point.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.180
Hey, why is the blue whale eating krill?

35:52.180 --> 35:54.060
It should be eating like smaller whales.

35:54.060 --> 35:57.060
Oh my God, we need a worthy challenger for the,

35:57.060 --> 36:00.900
we all need to team up and breed something

36:00.900 --> 36:03.980
for the blue whale to sharpen itself against.

36:03.980 --> 36:07.620
It is time for the killer whale to live up to its name.

36:07.620 --> 36:11.020
Yeah, you've got it, you don't have it in size, right?

36:11.020 --> 36:13.620
But you got it in ferocity for sure.

36:13.620 --> 36:16.220
You are an X-wing like going up

36:16.220 --> 36:18.300
against a Star Destroyer at that point.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.580
But this Star Destroyer, guess what?

36:19.580 --> 36:21.700
It only eats like little weird barnacles.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.700
You are totally good.

36:23.700 --> 36:26.580
This is my pitch for Free Willy 6.

36:26.580 --> 36:29.220
Where Willy just goes ham on a blue whale.

36:29.220 --> 36:31.500
Right, and it's two hours long,

36:31.500 --> 36:34.620
and it's really hard to watch that.

36:34.620 --> 36:35.580
But then what's that?

36:35.580 --> 36:39.700
The blue whale and Willy team up to fight a giant squid.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.660
Animals are great, I love nature.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.060
Yeah, and we know a lot about them.

36:43.060 --> 36:44.380
I love nature too.

36:44.380 --> 36:45.820
Yeah, we're very smart about them.

36:45.820 --> 36:46.980
Da da da da da da da da.

36:46.980 --> 36:47.820
Okay.

36:47.820 --> 36:49.660
Da da da da da da da da.

36:49.660 --> 36:50.500
Oh.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.660
Dee dee loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo.

36:53.660 --> 36:55.180
I want a munchwad!

36:55.180 --> 36:56.260
Slad.

36:56.260 --> 36:58.180
Wub bub bub bub bub bub bub.

36:58.180 --> 36:59.920
I want a munchwad!

37:01.920 --> 37:04.260
Do do do do do do do do do.

37:04.260 --> 37:06.660
I'm sorry I got a cold and I realized it sounded weird,

37:06.660 --> 37:07.500
like Alfred E. Newman or something.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.420
I kind of loved it.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.540
I kind of enjoyed it too.

37:10.540 --> 37:12.260
I got a munchwad mini,

37:12.260 --> 37:13.780
and then a full munchwad for you.

37:13.780 --> 37:15.140
I got combo.

37:15.140 --> 37:18.500
Duncan adds snacking bacon to the menu.

37:18.500 --> 37:19.460
What?

37:19.460 --> 37:21.620
Please tell me they used apostrophes in there.

37:21.620 --> 37:23.860
Oh yeah, they did.

37:23.860 --> 37:26.180
Duncan, snacking, bacon.

37:26.180 --> 37:27.020
Is bacon apostrophic?

37:27.020 --> 37:28.740
What is this, two?

37:28.740 --> 37:30.140
Nah, bacon's not.

37:30.140 --> 37:31.460
That'd be wild though.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.980
They missed a trick, huh?

37:32.980 --> 37:35.860
Yeah, so Duncan adds snacking bacon to the menu.

37:35.860 --> 37:39.340
This one's bacon in a little bag, my friends.

37:39.340 --> 37:43.540
It's just bacon in a little stinky, greasy bag.

37:43.540 --> 37:45.500
I'm glad it's not just loose bacon though.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.820
That is better.

37:46.820 --> 37:48.860
It is basically loose bacon, Travis.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.860
It's as close to loose bacon as you can get

37:50.860 --> 37:52.260
without being loose bacon.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.660
Without going to prison.

37:53.660 --> 37:54.500
Yeah.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.560
Here's how it starts.

37:55.560 --> 37:59.260
Sack the sad snacks with the new snacking bacon.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.100
Oh God.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.340
For anyone who's seeing a satisfying snack,

38:02.340 --> 38:04.020
seeking a satisfying snack,

38:04.020 --> 38:06.940
but this one seems designed to fuck me up.

38:06.940 --> 38:07.780
I see you, Duncan.

38:07.780 --> 38:09.300
We got him.

38:09.300 --> 38:11.900
For anyone who's seeking a satisfying snack

38:11.900 --> 38:15.220
but is stuck with a sad selection at their desk,

38:15.220 --> 38:17.180
office, kitchen, or vending machine,

38:17.180 --> 38:20.100
Duncan is adding some extra sizzle to its menu.

38:20.100 --> 38:24.060
Hey friends, if there is a sadder snack than bacon

38:24.060 --> 38:27.760
from a greasy little bag that you bought at the store

38:27.760 --> 38:30.900
and carried to your office, I don't know what it is.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.300
Duncan Wednesday unveiled new snacking bacon

38:34.300 --> 38:37.840
and with sweet black pepper seasoning

38:37.840 --> 38:41.140
to help on-the-go customers conquer nothing.

38:41.140 --> 38:42.260
It's not help.

38:42.260 --> 38:44.820
Help is the wildest word you could have picked.

38:44.820 --> 38:46.680
You're not helping them to do anything.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.120
They say they're helping their customers

38:48.120 --> 38:51.600
conquer their cravings without settling for tired

38:51.600 --> 38:53.460
and typical snacking choices.

38:53.460 --> 38:55.580
Hey, Roger, what are you snacking on

38:55.580 --> 38:57.260
out of that bag there?

38:57.260 --> 38:58.780
Bacon.

38:58.780 --> 39:02.220
Just some bacon in a bag, huh, Roger?

39:02.220 --> 39:03.780
Are you okay?

39:03.780 --> 39:04.620
Hey, Roger.

39:04.620 --> 39:09.340
Yeah, the only thing that you have to imagine with this

39:09.340 --> 39:11.060
is actually walking up to the counter

39:11.060 --> 39:13.740
and they're like, what food do you want here at Duncan

39:13.740 --> 39:15.600
that you've gone into willingly?

39:15.600 --> 39:20.500
And the person says, I want a bag of snacking bacon

39:20.500 --> 39:21.600
for the road.

39:21.600 --> 39:26.440
I actually think saying, for here, would be worse.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.620
That would actually, I'm gonna sit in the corner

39:28.620 --> 39:30.460
and listen to a podcast.

39:30.460 --> 39:31.460
Here's the full one.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.420
Einstein Brothers is gonna launch

39:33.420 --> 39:35.580
a bagel and burrito mashup.

39:35.580 --> 39:36.420
Huh.

39:36.420 --> 39:39.960
Is it just gonna jam it in the fucking hole?

39:39.960 --> 39:40.940
Basically.

39:40.940 --> 39:44.140
They announced, Einstein Brothers announces launching

39:44.140 --> 39:47.920
a first-of-its-kind bagel innovation, bagel-rito.

39:47.920 --> 39:52.160
Ah, a bagel and burrito mashup, the bagel-rito,

39:52.160 --> 39:55.360
was available at five test locations in the Denver area

39:55.360 --> 39:57.960
for a limited time on October 29th.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.200
And it's gonna shock you all, but it fucking cleaned up.

40:03.320 --> 40:07.440
It sold out within hours of its announcement to the world.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.200
Why did you announce it to the world?

40:09.200 --> 40:12.920
Let Denver get a fucking crack at that beautiful bastard.

40:13.760 --> 40:16.560
Do the wild success of the test launch

40:16.560 --> 40:19.880
and countless requests from guests

40:19.880 --> 40:22.320
who wish they could try the bagel-rito.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.080
Valerie, how many requests have we got about the bagel-rito?

40:26.080 --> 40:28.000
I can't count them.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.080
There's too many.

40:29.080 --> 40:29.960
They're pouring in.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.560
They're throwing them through the window.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.320
The bagel-matic is broken.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.040
It's like it just exploded everywhere.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.360
Can't count that high.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.760
It's like the end of Miracle on 34th Street in here.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.120
Why did we set up a complex system of pneumatic tubes

40:43.120 --> 40:46.520
from every Einstein Brothers location into our home base?

40:46.520 --> 40:48.480
So the Einstein Brothers bagels

40:48.480 --> 40:50.920
is making the game-changing breakfast item

40:50.920 --> 40:55.480
available to guests across the US at participating locations.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.240
And the tone of this announcement

40:58.240 --> 41:01.320
is that they think they're ready for bagel-ritos,

41:01.320 --> 41:03.480
but they're not fucking sure, okay?

41:03.480 --> 41:06.480
They're on the very edge.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.320
Quote, we heard our guests loud and clear,

41:09.320 --> 41:12.040
says Takeo O'Rourke, VP of Marketing

41:12.040 --> 41:13.680
for Einstein Brothers Bagels.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.360
They always have to clarify what company

41:15.360 --> 41:16.880
they're the VP of marketing of.

41:16.880 --> 41:19.160
It'd be wild if the VP of marketing at Ford

41:19.160 --> 41:20.880
is like, they got nasty new bagels.

41:20.880 --> 41:24.440
This place got nasty new bagels.

41:26.720 --> 41:30.120
Cars are still cool, but check out these nasty bagel tubes.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.640
Given the popularity of the bagel-rito

41:32.640 --> 41:34.280
during the Denver test,

41:34.280 --> 41:37.440
we knew we couldn't keep this breakfast innovation

41:37.440 --> 41:40.400
from the rest of the country for too long.

41:40.400 --> 41:44.520
We just needed a bit of time to ensure our bakeries

41:44.520 --> 41:48.320
are set up to meet the volume of orders we're expecting.

41:48.320 --> 41:53.320
On February 27th, we will be ready.

41:54.040 --> 41:57.520
Constantly pushing the boundaries of the classic bagel.

41:57.520 --> 42:00.600
Einstein Brothers bagel has taken it to the next level

42:00.600 --> 42:01.440
with the bagel-rito.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.720
Has taken it too far.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.400
Too far, they've crossed the Rubicon

42:05.400 --> 42:07.760
and made a shame before God.

42:07.760 --> 42:10.240
It's loaded with two cage-free eggs,

42:10.240 --> 42:15.240
for that animal-cruelty-conscious consumer

42:15.640 --> 42:18.920
that also wants to eat a bagel shaped like a fucking tube.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.040
And it's got thick-cut bacon from, I'm assuming,

42:22.040 --> 42:26.140
inhumanely raised pigs and turkey sausage.

42:26.140 --> 42:27.880
Let's get them all in there.

42:27.880 --> 42:30.220
The pigs watch the chickens run around.

42:30.220 --> 42:32.200
Come back here, Cal, you don't get out.

42:32.200 --> 42:35.760
We need three cheeses from you and potatoes.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.760
Your non-sentient state will not preserve you.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.440
There's hash browns in this bad boy

42:40.440 --> 42:44.320
and salsa and green chilies and a flour tortilla

42:44.320 --> 42:47.880
all hand-wrapped in an Asiago bagel dough and baked fresh.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.720
And what a relief that machines aren't involved

42:50.720 --> 42:51.960
in this process.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.520
I'm glad humans have to use some of their time

42:54.520 --> 42:58.600
here on this big blue globe to roll these bagel tubes for me.

42:58.600 --> 43:02.080
It's substantial size, high flavor, and portability

43:02.080 --> 43:02.920
has earned it.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.800
High flavor is a good term.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.040
I like high flavor.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.880
The high flavor and portability.

43:10.880 --> 43:11.720
Folks-

43:11.720 --> 43:12.560
Thank God.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.040
Bagels have been so cumbersome up till now.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.040
And burritos too.

43:16.040 --> 43:17.000
Yeah.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.700
Yeah, friends, I'm here to ask you,

43:19.700 --> 43:23.240
what is the last item that you bought at a fast food place

43:23.240 --> 43:26.120
where you're like, well, I can't take this anywhere.

43:26.120 --> 43:26.960
Look at this.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.160
Look at this heavy, I can't carry,

43:29.160 --> 43:32.300
what am I, to carry it to another location?

43:33.400 --> 43:37.360
The high flavor and portability has earned it its slogan,

43:37.360 --> 43:39.920
big, bold, and easy to hold.

43:39.920 --> 43:40.760
Oh, boy.

43:40.760 --> 43:44.880
Who are these people that have a regular bagel

43:44.880 --> 43:47.000
and they're like, whoop, drop the damn thing.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.480
Oh, fuck.

43:49.480 --> 43:50.300
Now it's rolling away.

43:50.300 --> 43:51.620
Again?

43:51.620 --> 43:52.460
Again?

43:52.460 --> 43:54.920
And hey, friends, I'm looking at this thing.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.120
It's a big, loose tube full of garbage.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.200
This is not a portable solution.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.960
Just as it's closed at the bottom,

44:01.960 --> 44:04.360
you're gonna have bagel juice slipping out.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.840
Anyway, that's the bagelrito.

44:05.840 --> 44:06.680
Looks pretty good.

44:06.680 --> 44:07.920
I would probably eat one

44:07.920 --> 44:09.640
and it's available at Einstein Brothers now.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.160
Next time I'm out to eat at a restaurant,

44:11.160 --> 44:13.360
I'm just gonna silently open up the salt shaker

44:13.360 --> 44:14.980
and dump it all over my meal.

44:14.980 --> 44:18.520
And then when Rachel asks like, hey, what are you doing?

44:18.520 --> 44:20.260
I can now confidently answer,

44:20.260 --> 44:22.340
I am turning the flavor too high.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.200
The flavor is not at high right now.

44:26.200 --> 44:29.200
I need maximum flavor.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.760
It's what I deserve as a consumer.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.100
I deserve no less.

44:33.100 --> 44:34.680
We rarely go out.

44:34.680 --> 44:36.880
It's hard to find a babysitter.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.240
What am I gonna eat?

44:38.240 --> 44:39.840
Regular flavor?

44:39.840 --> 44:41.520
I deserve high flavor.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.040
Well, we'll get out of your hair now.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.880
Once again, maximumfun.org.

44:47.880 --> 44:50.680
That sounds like we're backing out the door.

44:50.680 --> 44:53.360
We've been trying to sell you some brushes and combs.

44:53.360 --> 44:57.240
All right, well, you've been a gracious host.

44:57.240 --> 44:58.520
Maximumfun.org slash join.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.520
Thank you so much.

44:59.520 --> 45:02.760
And thank you to John Roderick in the long winters

45:02.760 --> 45:03.800
for the use of our theme song

45:03.800 --> 45:06.760
and to departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

45:06.760 --> 45:08.680
And we're about to put this episode to bed

45:08.680 --> 45:11.080
because fish and friends go bad after three days,

45:11.080 --> 45:11.920
right guys?

45:13.840 --> 45:14.880
What is that?

45:14.880 --> 45:17.160
Are we fish?

45:17.160 --> 45:18.240
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo?

45:18.240 --> 45:19.080
We're friends.

45:19.080 --> 45:20.700
This one was sent in by Yohannes.

45:20.700 --> 45:21.680
Thank you, Yohannes.

45:21.680 --> 45:24.600
It's from Yahoo Answers user T.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.440
Who asks?

45:25.440 --> 45:32.440
Dude, I just recently discovered a new way to eat oats.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.360
My name is Justin McElroy.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.080
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

45:39.080 --> 46:04.080
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.
