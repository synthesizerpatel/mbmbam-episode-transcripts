00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

There's there's shirtless there's shirtless jeans Griffin J dot J peg

02:35.260 --> 02:39.220

Now I've done one here and that one that one's that one's like nine books

02:56.340 --> 03:02.460
I've done one here where what I've done it so you guys know the Mona Lisa, right? Yes

03:02.980 --> 03:07.540
So yes, I took a picture of that when I was at the Louvre. Yeah, and then I

03:08.180 --> 03:09.780
photoshopped in

03:09.780 --> 03:12.940
An engorged penis instead of the face. Oh

03:13.500 --> 03:18.340
Call it boner Lisa and before you ask for hey, we're not in work of art

03:18.340 --> 03:22.340
We're not I understand I understand into it, but it is kind of a tribute to yeah

03:22.340 --> 03:27.820
Thank you. Yes a little bit still kept the enigmatic smile. This is a boner with a secret and

03:28.980 --> 03:35.440
That one the bidding actually started at $50,000, but it's already been more or less purchased. We're in final talks

03:36.160 --> 03:39.340
Tom Hanks wants to buy it and option it and write a script about it

03:39.340 --> 03:46.180
Yeah, kind of I think it's like a da Vinci code spin-off or something. Yeah, so that's more or less spoken for at this point

03:47.020 --> 03:49.820
So these are really exciting and we're using

03:49.820 --> 03:51.420
some

03:51.420 --> 03:53.420
of the usual channels to

03:54.260 --> 03:56.260
Sell these NFTs

03:56.980 --> 03:59.620
Books a million one of them might be

04:00.580 --> 04:02.580
crypto

04:02.980 --> 04:08.660
Site uh-huh open place open to site openplace.gov

04:12.500 --> 04:14.380
We're so these and

04:14.380 --> 04:16.420
We're just excited and I yes

04:16.420 --> 04:21.620
Uh-huh to answer your question three percent of all profits will be

04:22.660 --> 04:26.380
Given to charity. So I mean I might that's well

04:27.260 --> 04:28.940
like 1.5

04:28.940 --> 04:33.740
To well three point it's there's a percentage deal. Okay, so thank you

04:33.780 --> 04:38.620
We're also doing mp3s, which is what a lot of people are calling mp3s these days. Yeah

04:39.540 --> 04:45.860
This episode every word I'm saying right now. It's just like money money when I'm saying the words money money money money money

04:45.860 --> 04:48.540
It's actually increasing the value of them of the money

04:49.340 --> 04:51.760
Yeah, and I'm releasing my own

04:52.580 --> 04:56.380

05:01.540 --> 05:03.540
through

05:04.060 --> 05:05.900
Check this out

05:05.900 --> 05:07.220
Bazinga

05:07.220 --> 05:14.260
So I'm gonna NFT that that just that one sort of one and a half second sound bite. Sorry. Wait. Oh

05:14.260 --> 05:15.340
Oh

05:15.340 --> 05:19.980
They got another press conference starting here. Oh, so we got a ring. Thank you. Yeah

05:19.980 --> 05:22.620
Thank you so much for coming and we'll turn everything right now

05:25.340 --> 05:29.220
Hello everybody, thank you for thank you for coming today

05:31.820 --> 05:33.820
Gosh where to begin? Yeah

05:34.100 --> 05:40.940
Mistakes were made we are but first let me begin with an apology. Yeah, we did not consider

05:41.700 --> 05:42.820
our

05:42.820 --> 05:44.660
NFT program

05:44.660 --> 05:52.340
Before we announced it. Yeah to you the the listening public and for that we are I mean so sorry

05:53.140 --> 05:57.060
Really really so and I know what you're thinking. But then how did you schedule this press conference?

05:57.060 --> 06:01.820
This was going to be a bit of a victory lap press conference because we thought we had done

06:01.980 --> 06:06.160
We thought we've figured out you know, he's and we're gonna brag about how good we did

06:06.160 --> 06:12.280
um, but you know, uh, you know, yeah, you make a plan and God laughs

06:14.280 --> 06:18.360
Some of the things we've heard one if I could just run down

06:21.040 --> 06:22.480
One

06:22.480 --> 06:24.480
Stupid yeah, like that's

06:25.360 --> 06:27.360
That was a big one

06:27.780 --> 06:34.240
Number two killing the planet. Yeah, there are apparently these things they're not so nifty for old Mother Earth

06:34.240 --> 06:39.140
Yeah, which is weird. It's just me saying Bazinga and then a thousand trees die

06:40.200 --> 06:41.960
Now to be fair

06:41.960 --> 06:45.320
Boner Lisa is a lot of giggle bites. It's

06:46.000 --> 06:50.120
It's it's about a hundred GBS. It's uncompressed all the way

06:50.360 --> 06:54.600
Yeah, if you tweeted when you were listening to the first part of this

06:55.360 --> 06:58.540
About how mad you were. Yeah, we hope you will now

06:58.540 --> 07:05.620
We did see that we heard you and if you could issue a retraction like thank goodness

07:05.620 --> 07:12.180
They're doing the right thing. Yeah, boy. These guys always they say the McElroy's they usually get it right in the end

07:12.180 --> 07:14.060
Right. This is probably our quickest turnaround

07:14.060 --> 07:18.140
Yeah, I think from three guys that announced the slay the live shows and cancel them the next day

07:18.140 --> 07:23.780
So like this is actually a new land speed a new land shame record for us, which is here

07:23.780 --> 07:31.020
And I do want to Tom Hanks if you're listening, I will not be returning the down payment on Boner Lisa. That is already spent

07:32.260 --> 07:39.060
You know what? It's a real fucking crypto geek. Yeah, well, he loves it cuz he first got into it cuz he was like Crips

07:39.060 --> 07:44.740
I love exploring those things and then I explained to him but he's had already invested millions of dollars, right?

07:44.740 --> 07:49.460
And I did want to say to Elon Musk. I think you stink, but thank you

07:49.700 --> 07:52.780
Thank you for the seven and a half million dollars for Bazinga

07:52.780 --> 07:55.620
I notice you've been putting it in all your tweets

07:55.620 --> 07:59.500
You've been embedding the Bazinga soundbite in all your tweets, which I did not know was possible

08:00.180 --> 08:02.660
and it's it is fit is funny and

08:03.300 --> 08:04.580
I

08:04.580 --> 08:11.260
Guess I guess that's all I did again personally on like a personal moral level. I I do think that you are

08:11.900 --> 08:19.020
Shit head belongs in the garbage, but I do I I'm gonna do so much good with that eight and a half million

08:19.020 --> 08:21.180
I forget what I said is a lot of money though

08:21.180 --> 08:23.180
So thank you, and we're sorry

08:24.900 --> 08:26.900
Well, not that Tom Hanks

08:27.580 --> 08:31.660
I'm sorry to Tom Hanks about what that's just cuz I haven't watched it yet

08:32.900 --> 08:36.980
Yeah, oh yeah, I got I keep getting those texts like what do you think and I'm like, it's next

08:37.740 --> 08:42.780
Next on this buddy promise. I've been saying that for a while and then Witcher came out and I was like, oh man

08:42.780 --> 08:45.020
I gotta watch Witcher first and he's like I get it. I get it

08:45.020 --> 08:48.580
I love Geralt and all of his wacky shenanigans, but then you'll watch fence, right?

08:48.580 --> 08:52.660
And I was like, well, it's not really I don't know if it's a holiday appropriate and he was like, oh, yeah

08:52.660 --> 08:57.180
I get that but like January 2nd, and I was like you got it buddy, and I know I'm not going to

08:57.780 --> 09:03.860
Like a cowboy bebop rewatch. Well, it's more like a rework. They should have a name for a rewatch that you do the first time

09:03.860 --> 09:04.740
Yeah

09:04.740 --> 09:10.700
But it's it's like that from my desk at work a note from Justin McElroy

09:12.300 --> 09:14.300
Re the NFT

09:14.300 --> 09:17.700
From the desk of Justin, well

09:18.940 --> 09:23.980
Team McElroy, we let you down again and gosh gosh. It's a tough one

09:23.980 --> 09:26.620
I have a door that opens into a common hallway

09:28.620 --> 09:29.860
Door

09:29.860 --> 09:35.940
Everyone who goes past can see me and I can overhear any conversations in the hall. I can show it all

09:37.860 --> 09:40.620
I'm just watching the game controlling. I

09:40.620 --> 09:47.100
I just heard another co-worker telling someone that there was birthday cake downstairs and that they should go as a group to get some

09:47.620 --> 09:54.580
However, I don't know whose birthday it is and that co-worker didn't explicitly invite me even though she could see me at my desk

09:54.580 --> 09:56.580
I really want free cake

09:56.940 --> 10:03.180
But I'm afraid it's gonna be awkward if I go down to this party alone and I'm invited brothers

10:03.180 --> 10:07.820
How can I invite myself down for some cake? That's from cake conundrum in California

10:07.820 --> 10:09.380
I

10:09.380 --> 10:15.780
Listen, it's go please. Yeah, I feel like this is a non-problem, right if there's they're all non-problems

10:16.300 --> 10:20.860
Travis we got a podcast. Yeah, we don't put we don't include actual problems

10:20.860 --> 10:25.900
If the statement is made there is birthday cake downstairs now what I am assuming here

10:26.340 --> 10:29.660
Because there's no other details given that even though it is a separate floor

10:29.660 --> 10:34.260
It is the same business that this is not like a different business that you would be

10:34.260 --> 10:40.500
Oh interesting. That's a different thing. But as long as this is like the same business and just a different floor of the office

10:40.780 --> 10:44.940
The cakes there for everybody whether you know who that person is or not, right? Like yeah

10:45.740 --> 10:52.500
There has never been an office birthday cake in which you had to pass a test of like answering

10:52.860 --> 10:57.640
Personal questions about the person and chances are there are names on the ding-dang thing

10:58.820 --> 11:00.260
It's but no

11:00.260 --> 11:05.900
I don't think I don't think this is as risk-free as you're making it out to be because there's gonna be a lot of people

11:05.900 --> 11:08.100
down there and if you're not the type of person that usually

11:08.500 --> 11:13.900
Socializes and you grab yourself a big honking piece of cake that had the one that actually has

11:14.620 --> 11:16.620
Deremey's face on it

11:17.180 --> 11:19.860
Then they're not gonna they're not gonna just let that slide

11:20.300 --> 11:25.220
Can can I I don't want to be a real fud fuddy-duddy and I know that's a real fud rucker

11:25.220 --> 11:30.740
I occupy the fud rucker sector on this show more times than I prefer but

11:32.020 --> 11:34.020
most

11:34.020 --> 11:38.660
birthday cake specifically store-bought birthday cake is not like

11:39.380 --> 11:40.900
very good

11:40.900 --> 11:45.740
or at least not as not so good that it merits this kind of like

11:46.160 --> 11:49.540
What I would call bold sort of social interaction. Oh

11:49.540 --> 11:54.860
No, no, it's like somebody has been living away from Kroger for too long

11:54.860 --> 12:01.380
It has you've forgotten the face of your whippy because Kroger Kroger whippy is worth it

12:01.380 --> 12:04.340
Sure, Kroger with hey folks. Have you never had a cake Kroger whip?

12:04.340 --> 12:08.300
It's a bad get yourself and do a Kroger right away and get you some whipping

12:08.300 --> 12:11.300
Not only that Griffin, but I know you I've known you for a long time

12:11.300 --> 12:15.820
You've never had a traditional office job. So you do not know the joy to try data

12:15.820 --> 12:19.900
I guess that's true for one. I don't know you at all. You're a complete stranger to me

12:19.900 --> 12:24.180
but maybe you've just forgotten in the intervening years the joy of

12:24.940 --> 12:28.500
Having any kind of blip of difference in the day

12:28.980 --> 12:32.300
We're like you go into work and you're like, this is a normal day, right?

12:32.380 --> 12:38.020
Yeah, and then all it takes is like you could have a surprise piece of cake no matter what the quality

12:38.540 --> 12:44.740
Well, that's different right that feeling of it's not about if the cake is good or not. It's that it's

12:44.740 --> 12:49.140
Different than not cake. That's fair, but I

12:49.780 --> 12:56.500
It's I've had so many crumbly ass birthday cakes. Hey, can I just a quick aside? I did tell Henry

12:57.540 --> 13:01.420
Like early this year about how Tommy Smurl fired me

13:02.100 --> 13:05.060
a very good job during my summer working at tri-data and

13:05.580 --> 13:08.140
to this day he still

13:08.940 --> 13:13.020
leverages that in any sort of example where he needs to

13:13.020 --> 13:15.260
Take me down a peg or two

13:16.140 --> 13:20.780
Wow, just a lot of like you better come to the blue room and play with me or else

13:20.780 --> 13:23.980
I'm gonna call Tommy to have him fire you again. Oh, yeah

13:24.780 --> 13:27.060
Or is this true? It is a hundred percent true

13:27.060 --> 13:32.660
The first time he did it was kind of sweet because he was like when we go to when we go home for Christmas

13:33.220 --> 13:40.140
I'm not I'm gonna yell at Tommy because he fired you and I was like damn that would be one fucking hysterical

13:40.140 --> 13:45.020
Yeah, it's too really sweet. But now he's decided like it's good that Tommy fired me

13:45.460 --> 13:51.140
You know, I've been I've been reviewing the logs you were behind on your quotas. Yeah, fucking of course

13:51.140 --> 13:53.140
I was dog. You went to Bonnaroo. I know

13:53.640 --> 13:59.780
No, I mean even when I was at that job, I was still I was buddy the elf making etch-a-sketches. I was a fucking idiot

14:00.820 --> 14:02.120
anyway

14:02.120 --> 14:04.120
Can we talk to the wizard for a sec?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.580
Yeah, let's approach him

14:05.580 --> 14:10.540
The Wizards got a really wild one for us a real wild ride for us and I would say thank you to the wizard and also

14:10.540 --> 14:12.540
Thank you to drew for sending this in

14:12.820 --> 14:14.820
How to stop a wedding? Oh

14:15.620 --> 14:22.340
We've all seen the movies where a person halts a wedding and progress in order to get the one they truly love in reality

14:22.340 --> 14:25.380
Stopping a wedding is a much more serious undertaking. It involves

14:28.860 --> 14:34.380
It involves a lot of thought and planning and taking an honest look at your motives and intentions if you truly believe the couple

14:34.380 --> 14:36.820
Shouldn't be together and if you believe you're justified in doing so

14:36.820 --> 14:41.680
We have some suggestions for going about stopping a wedding with logic and legal action

14:42.100 --> 14:45.680
Now just real quick check in between me and my brothers here

14:45.900 --> 14:50.500
when you got how old were you guys before you had the realization that the

14:50.940 --> 14:57.660
If anybody doesn't want them to get married speak now wasn't actually like a normal part of a wedding

14:57.900 --> 15:00.860
Like I that's it doesn't pop up as much when I was a kid

15:00.860 --> 15:08.140
I thought that there was a tense moment and every wedding was just like a quick audience poll anybody and if you like well

15:08.140 --> 15:12.740
Only two people raised their hands. So we're gonna keep going with it. I think everybody cool

15:12.740 --> 15:17.660
I mean I get though if I ever heard anybody do it. It's been in like everybody's

15:18.180 --> 15:20.180
There's there's a human in there

15:20.460 --> 15:26.860
Let's be honest. It's usually like a friend of the groom who set has a big problem like with silences

15:26.860 --> 15:30.920
You know what? I mean? Just like it starts to like get too real and he's like, yeah, Rick sucks

15:32.380 --> 15:34.380
Okay

15:37.860 --> 15:41.700
I know Rick's my best friend, but I just really shit

15:43.140 --> 15:45.340
We didn't do this at mine and Rachel's wedding

15:45.340 --> 15:47.980
But I kind of wish we did because there's something about like

15:48.380 --> 15:55.340
Putting your love through that crucible like making it vulnerable for a second because you do you expose you lift up the armor

15:55.340 --> 15:58.840
To show your soft underbelly because you're like if you really do

15:59.440 --> 16:06.880
Want to step to this and tear apart this infinite love this here's your chance. Oh, see I I wish I'd done it

16:06.880 --> 16:11.200
Just for entrapment just like somebody's like, yeah, you know what and I'm like hot trick question

16:11.200 --> 16:14.680
We're not gonna not get married. But now you get the fuck out of here

16:14.680 --> 16:19.500
You don't get any cake later or they speak their mind and then the efficient is like, okay noted

16:19.840 --> 16:21.840
No one gives a shit

16:22.440 --> 16:24.440
That was rude sit down

16:24.440 --> 16:31.880
I don't make this about you Derek. Let's get into it man. Part one approaching the couple consider your motivations

16:31.880 --> 16:33.880
Why do you want to stop the wedding?

16:34.080 --> 16:37.600
It doesn't say because you're in love with the other person, but maybe we'll get to that point

16:38.240 --> 16:44.440
Don't bait don't base halting a wedding purely on emotions like jealousy or hatred those can be worked through with communication and therapy

16:45.360 --> 16:48.160
Okay, but it's not a bad place to start. Yeah

16:49.080 --> 16:53.240
Talk to the family members or other people involved in the wedding to find out if someone else feels similarly

16:53.240 --> 16:57.080
Psst, hey grandma. Hey butch's grandma. Hey

16:57.840 --> 16:59.840
This feels off, right?

17:00.040 --> 17:02.600
Where you at? Just hot or cold? Yeah

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
Hey, hey Stacy's dad

17:06.600 --> 17:13.520
Sucks, right my writer. All right. Also, uh, when are you gonna divorce your wife so I can date her? Yeah

17:14.200 --> 17:16.040
Cuz it's Stacy's mom

17:16.040 --> 17:19.320
Let's meet with the bride and groom privately to talk

17:19.320 --> 17:23.520
It's a fun conversation. That's gonna go great. Hey guys, what's up?

17:23.920 --> 17:29.920
We got beer in the fridge and I don't think you should be in I don't think you should be in love forever

17:31.080 --> 17:35.160
And then here's a PowerPoint presentation. I and I really want you to pay attention

17:35.160 --> 17:39.200
I worked really hard on this PowerPoint of why can you not actually embrace right now?

17:39.200 --> 17:42.080
I need you guys to sit sort of farther apart from one another

17:42.640 --> 17:46.840
In fact, I have two separate presentations. Yours is going to be over there in

17:46.840 --> 17:50.960
My kid's room. I've set it up and yours is gonna be in here

17:51.280 --> 17:56.240
So if you guys could take breaks about 45 minutes, so like go to the bathroom first, right?

17:56.380 --> 18:01.560
Cuz I don't want to I don't want to pause them. They're kind of synchronized. And so I don't want it to get off

18:02.560 --> 18:05.080
This is a long article address your concerns one-on-one

18:05.080 --> 18:09.100
This may be a good time to ask questions about how they're feeling about the wedding and what their future looks like in their eyes

18:09.120 --> 18:11.760
Why they believe their significant other is the one for them, etc

18:11.760 --> 18:17.920
That kind of discussion could bring up on certainly uncertainty that they may have about getting married and you can use it to enable

18:17.920 --> 18:20.440
Them to think a little more and possibly call off the wedding

18:21.520 --> 18:23.520
wowsers Bowser's that is

18:24.120 --> 18:29.200
That's pretty I would say toxic behavior from you the friend who was concerned about both of them

18:29.200 --> 18:31.200
Oh, what's that they snore, huh?

18:31.520 --> 18:33.520
Something to think about

18:33.840 --> 18:37.040
You know, they're gonna store all the all the time forever

18:37.040 --> 18:41.680
Mmm, have you smelled this guy's football farts?

18:46.320 --> 18:50.120
I thought it was like after they played football or anything play football

18:50.120 --> 18:53.600
They come back to the locker room and really stink up the joint

18:55.160 --> 18:57.360
Convinced the couple to wait a year. Come on guys

18:58.000 --> 19:05.920
Come on guys. Listen to my points. It just take a year like it's irresponsible to rush into this that you've been dating for 12 years

19:05.920 --> 19:07.480
Oh

19:07.480 --> 19:11.160
You've waited this long to have sex just one more year a little bit more

19:11.800 --> 19:16.800
Another she used to hold off until another year would be family events coming up such as grandpa's 80th or the birth of a new baby

19:17.680 --> 19:23.560
You could see if you could maybe double up grandpa's 80th with the wedding. So that way people don't have to travel as much

19:24.160 --> 19:27.200
Yeah, let's gather everyone around grandpa

19:27.200 --> 19:35.640
Right now presently everyone surround and press your bodies against let's lay hands on grandpa. Let's lay breath on grandpa

19:36.640 --> 19:39.000
Everybody just give the breath of life to grandpa

19:40.000 --> 19:42.120
Touch this man's touch this old man's face

19:42.680 --> 19:46.280
We're gonna hold his eye open so you can just touch his eyeball

19:46.280 --> 19:51.000
How could you even think about getting married in the same year as grandpa's final birthday?

19:51.000 --> 19:56.640
Hold on why are we calling it that?

19:58.000 --> 20:02.520
This let me just say that the wikiHow art it's always good so far

20:02.520 --> 20:07.120
it's just been a couple listening to their friend who looks more and more frantic and

20:07.280 --> 20:12.080
The couple's faces look more and more like what the fuck are you talking about?

20:12.080 --> 20:18.840
and this in this one the the woman in this couple is just piercing daggers right at the man as he

20:18.840 --> 20:21.120
Step five suggest a fake wedding

20:21.680 --> 20:25.920
Discuss holding a wedding celebration, but without the minister and paperwork

20:25.920 --> 20:30.560
No one else has to know it's not legally binding and everyone can still enjoy themselves

20:30.560 --> 20:34.320
What would be the context for that? How is how would that sales pitch?

20:34.320 --> 20:38.120
Hey guys guys guys guys have I got an idea for you?

20:38.120 --> 20:44.720
Yes, imagine if you will the cost and inconvenience of a wedding, but without any of the permanent effects

20:44.720 --> 20:47.680
And that way you guys can just bail whenever you want

20:47.680 --> 20:53.480
Right, isn't that no that's the opposite wait. Oh, you're telling me. Okay. That's the opposite

20:53.480 --> 20:59.920
Okay, it gets wilder part two taking other action one call out the lies if you know the way if you know

20:59.920 --> 21:01.920
The wedding is a fraud

21:01.920 --> 21:07.680
What if you succeeded in the in the prior step and convincing them to have a proof that this is a

21:08.280 --> 21:13.560
Phony baloney tech rehearsal wedding or if there are legal reasons the wedding should not go through as planned

21:13.560 --> 21:15.960
You have at least 28 days to take legal action

21:15.960 --> 21:22.200
Hey, what's up? I'm here to legally stop a wedding. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that sir. Well, what when was it scheduled for?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.200
Oh, I don't know. Let me call an S

21:26.200 --> 21:33.040
I was actually uninvited. Let me call and double-check. I love hey wiki how just throwing out that there's a

21:33.840 --> 21:40.760
Legal reason that the wedding should not happen and throwing that in there with I don't know if you two are gonna get along forever

21:40.760 --> 21:46.760
That feels like that should be a separate article, right? Like it's all right. I have

21:47.400 --> 21:50.320
I'm thinking about something as we talk about this, you know a wedding

21:50.320 --> 21:55.560
Obviously weddings are kind of out of vogue with a lot of people in which I completely get everybody should do their own thing

21:55.560 --> 22:02.080
But we did the wedding thing all three of us here not together. No, no, no, that would have been that would have been weird

22:02.360 --> 22:05.600
We did the wedding separately thing and um, the you know

22:05.600 --> 22:11.680
The stress of a wedding is like it feels like, you know, this is your you know, this is your shot to get it

22:11.680 --> 22:14.160
right, you're just gonna get married one time and

22:14.840 --> 22:19.000
It's a lot of expense and like you have to come up with opinions about stuff

22:19.000 --> 22:23.760
Yeah, you may not necessarily care about and if it doesn't go well, then it's like

22:24.480 --> 22:26.480
Devastating right, but what if

22:27.840 --> 22:31.840
Every wedding had like a villain, right?

22:31.840 --> 22:35.960
I feel like maybe if you have the Phantom of the Wedding. Yeah, where it's like

22:36.720 --> 22:40.040
your choices then don't just become a reflection of

22:40.840 --> 22:42.840
your

22:43.080 --> 22:47.960
Personalities and your love. Yeah, but more like a defensive sort of like

22:48.680 --> 22:55.560
Preparing for in defiance. Yeah, the different ways that the Phantom of the Wedding will like try to thwart you

22:55.560 --> 22:57.160
That's good and your actions

22:57.160 --> 23:03.840
So like it gives it a slightly more competitive element where it's like if it goes 80% good

23:03.840 --> 23:05.840
Yeah, that's awesome, right?

23:05.840 --> 23:07.840
Because you've like thwarted

23:07.840 --> 23:12.840
The Phantom at a lot of different turns with a lot of their different machinations

23:12.840 --> 23:15.440
Yeah, you try to keep your your marriage from culminating

23:15.440 --> 23:19.240
Well, cuz that's the thing to keep in mind is you and your your partner, right?

23:19.240 --> 23:24.000
You've got a lot on your mind that has to go, right all the Phantom has to do is make things go wrong

23:24.000 --> 23:27.440
And that's a lot easier. So if you get 80% it's a huge victory now

23:27.440 --> 23:31.240
I will also add to this plane just and another reason I like the introduction of the Phantom

23:31.520 --> 23:35.680
Is you can then also create whatever the opposite of a safe word is with the Phantom

23:35.680 --> 23:42.320
Well, if too much is going badly you say that word and the Phantom ends the wedding. Yeah, you're fault

23:42.320 --> 23:47.720
It's a fantasy. He won the Phantom one and you get a redo you get to do the wedding again

23:47.720 --> 23:50.880
You should be able to pick your villain too. Like oh

23:50.880 --> 23:58.040
Yeah, like I'm dead by dawn or dead by daylight. Here comes. Dr. Bones the skeleton that always comes to try and stop our wedding

23:58.040 --> 24:02.720
Here's the problem. Yes. Yes. Is that you there's no problem. Dr. Bones. Oh, no

24:02.720 --> 24:05.720
It's the praying mantis that's been hunting me ever since I was a child

24:06.720 --> 24:08.720
Dr. Bones is a

24:09.360 --> 24:16.840
Contractor who you are going to have to seek out and hire so it's like I in in hiring. Dr. Bones. You are

24:16.840 --> 24:21.040
Participating in the process that dr. Bones is sworn to disrupt. This is the best

24:22.040 --> 24:27.720
Man thing you the best man hires. Yes, you actually don't know who it is. Can you imagine how much we're thrilling?

24:27.720 --> 24:32.280
It would be to plan a wedding if when you're talking to DJ you're like and you promise you're not gonna play our Kelly songs

24:32.280 --> 24:34.280
Like oh, yeah. Yeah, and you're not

24:34.920 --> 24:42.000
Really really really you understand. It's like oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I'm a friendly skeleton. My name is dr. Toons

24:42.000 --> 24:49.720
I play the tunes you see I'm dr. Craigslist. Mm-hmm. No, I'm Frankenstein sponsor, but I'm not here for that

24:49.720 --> 24:56.640
I'm in my off time. I'm a DJ. I promise you I know why you would assume that I'm working for the phantoms

24:56.640 --> 25:03.920
And that's like completely fair. No, no, I'm the DJing mantis. I promise you I'm going to bite the head off of boredom

25:03.920 --> 25:08.840
That's drama. I mean that's drama. That's what you want from from the show. That's what you want from the show

25:08.840 --> 25:13.120
That's drama. I mean that's drama. That's what you want from from any event

25:13.120 --> 25:19.520
I mean, I'm maybe this is good for birthday parties do yeah, it's like you have someone working against you. Yeah when you're planning a party

25:19.520 --> 25:25.080
How was the bridal shower? Oh, I was great. It was a really good crudite and we defeated that evil Sasquatch

25:27.480 --> 25:29.960
Not the stinky Sasquatch, yeah, he showed up

25:30.440 --> 25:34.440
He tried to take the cake literally would be so fucking rad

25:34.440 --> 25:41.400
If you're like trying to do a wedding and you think that you've gotten away with it, and you've defeated the phantom and then a werewolf

25:43.320 --> 25:45.480
Like oh fuck now we got to deal with this

25:46.120 --> 25:50.080
What's that all the phantom arrived? He's gonna help you fight the werewolf. Oh

25:50.800 --> 25:56.360
Enemies to friends everybody loves that. Let's keep rockin step to involve others. That's great

25:56.360 --> 25:59.680
Like get their best friends all in a big group

26:00.160 --> 26:02.160
to really really

26:02.160 --> 26:04.800
Forever scar these people sort of emotionally

26:06.120 --> 26:09.680
It does say use this as a last resort because it could be pretty traumatic

26:09.680 --> 26:13.960
So at least they are sort of looking out and then step three is totally normal. Follow the money

26:14.920 --> 26:20.160
Whoa, if the couple are relying on one or both of their parents to support the wedding

26:20.160 --> 26:25.640
You may want to try and stop the money source. So the wedding will be called off to kill their parents

26:25.640 --> 26:30.100
I don't think that's what it's such. Oh, yeah, you're right Griffin because then they would still inherit it

26:30.100 --> 26:36.920
They would inherit. Yeah, so seduce the parents and yeah, you're going to marry them and then kill them

26:37.280 --> 26:41.160
All right, you inherit the money. You didn't have dr. Bones identity steal

26:41.560 --> 26:43.320
There's the same time

26:43.320 --> 26:48.320
I feel like getting to jump back a second group of friends to convince them out of it bad

26:48.600 --> 26:52.840
Group of enemies to just go on and on about what a good idea they think it is

26:53.280 --> 26:55.100
That's the way to go right now

26:55.100 --> 27:00.280
We're cooking with gas because a group of friends could go badly right because then it's like well

27:00.280 --> 27:03.480
We're still getting married and now we also hate all of you, right?

27:03.480 --> 27:08.600
But if they're like, oh, I hate Debbie from work and Debbie's like, I love that you guys are getting married

27:08.600 --> 27:12.080
That's so great. Like now it's like well fuck if Debbie thinks is a good idea

27:13.520 --> 27:18.600
The last section real quick waiting it out step one void the marriage after the wedding

27:18.600 --> 27:22.180
You can use an annulment to legally cancel out the marriages if it never happened

27:22.180 --> 27:25.500
Not second hand though as a third party

27:27.740 --> 27:32.580
Hey Pope, it's me Bob and now it they didn't fuck

27:34.920 --> 27:36.920
Let me see your rings

27:37.220 --> 27:39.220
You're not married no more

27:40.020 --> 27:43.900
You just got annulled if you press the annulment button and eat the rings

27:44.540 --> 27:46.380
It's done

27:46.380 --> 27:49.200
Step to wait for the marriage to fail down the road

27:49.200 --> 27:54.920
If the couple are fairly young and it's their first marriage, there's a 40% chance the marriage will end up for in divorce

27:54.920 --> 28:00.180
I'll those like wait for what to what end to wait for them to split up naturally

28:00.900 --> 28:07.080
Yeah, but then so but the reason to stop the marriage would be to stop something bad from happening and then you're like hey

28:07.080 --> 28:11.440
Well, that's right. Just wait for something wait for something bad to happen. There's no step here

28:11.440 --> 28:14.860
That's like rob it in their fucking faces do it

28:14.860 --> 28:21.180
But as they walk out of the the town hall where they and not sign the annulment papers

28:21.220 --> 28:27.980
You be there outside doing a quarterback dance just sort of yelling about how how you called it

28:28.300 --> 28:33.140
Step three and now you're mad cuz you ain't a couple but we're just here to do the Super Bowl shovel

28:33.140 --> 28:40.860
Perfect last step is move on but if you can't you won't

28:45.580 --> 28:50.340
That should honestly be number one in every wiki house should be just don't

28:50.340 --> 28:53.780
I said I think in the light during the live show

28:53.780 --> 28:54.140
Yes

28:54.140 --> 29:01.540
Keep your grades up and move on should be that should be step one move on step to keep your grades up step three

29:01.540 --> 29:06.300
All right, fine. Here you go more more. I tell you I've read like a lot of

29:06.980 --> 29:10.320
You know different how to's in my life for different hobbies or whatever

29:10.540 --> 29:16.540
So few of them in with like no window packing. Yeah, like, you know when you're like, maybe it's not for you

29:16.540 --> 29:21.820
I don't know. Hey look over look over his job. How's he doing on his? Oh, it's way better than yours

29:21.820 --> 29:26.620
Oh, you guys been doing it for the same amount of time, huh? Maybe you just don't have for you

29:26.620 --> 29:32.520
There's no one to quit on org. Uh, is it anything else Griffin? I mean, there's some questions from some people

29:33.020 --> 29:35.540
And a lot of people asking very inappropriate questions

29:35.540 --> 29:40.620
I would say someone asked is there a good way to stop my own wedding without making this things awkward and I would say

29:40.620 --> 29:46.740
It would be it would be a lot easier. Yeah, I think hiring a doctor bones or just asking one of your friends to start this

29:47.460 --> 29:52.620
This mission this quest to tear the two of you apart can't be one of your friends just side note

29:52.620 --> 29:57.060
You're going to have to plan ahead six months before the wedding hire like find

29:57.220 --> 30:03.420
Somebody right is a plant friend and you're going to do a lot to talk about how close you've grown together and how important they

30:03.420 --> 30:09.260
Are and then they're going to ruin it and then if that doesn't work you have to be ready to jettison that person

30:09.740 --> 30:12.700
Right. So I think you can't just pick your best friend to do it

30:12.820 --> 30:17.780
Especially if your parents are they're gonna be like hey your best friend kind of fucked this all up for you

30:17.780 --> 30:22.340
You got to be like, yeah, I don't talk to him anymore. Yeah, and it's because you like paid him

30:22.340 --> 30:24.340
That's full proof on him out

30:24.740 --> 30:26.740
Plus they are jobs creator

30:27.260 --> 30:31.900
Absolutely, that's the best part in this economy in this economy to keep this going

30:32.420 --> 30:38.380
No labor shortage. So when I don't need more jobs, we need better jobs better pay better fans. I'm great

30:40.580 --> 30:43.260
What's up guys I know we fucked up but

30:44.700 --> 30:48.500
Check our jobs out. What's that? They're pretty bad

30:49.340 --> 30:51.340
fuck

30:51.340 --> 30:55.320
$14 is a lot of money. What the fuck's wrong with you $14 is good

30:56.860 --> 31:03.160
We need to figure out a way to pronounce Papa John's with an audibly remove the apostrophe by the way

31:03.420 --> 31:08.540
How do you pronounce it different out loud? So if you're only hearing it audibly, you know, which one we're talking about

31:09.300 --> 31:14.860
Well, I mean you turn to John John's the Martian Manhunter right Papa John's there you go

31:14.860 --> 31:21.740
One option or maybe just Papa Shax I Papa Shax is much better Shack is much closer to the brand now I think it should

31:21.740 --> 31:23.740
Actually, just mean pizza shack, by the way

31:24.260 --> 31:28.300
Pizza shack is really good. I know. Thank you very much

31:29.660 --> 31:31.660
Well, it'll be pizza shacks

31:32.180 --> 31:36.960
Where do you want to order from pizza shacks? Well, which one you gonna then it maybe it could be pizzas shacks

31:36.960 --> 31:44.880
No, it wouldn't be pizza shacks. That's it. That is a wild Yoda esque way. Oh

31:46.080 --> 31:48.080
The pizza of shack

31:48.360 --> 31:52.040
Like Shaq is Shaq is like huh? Yeah, you understand

31:53.000 --> 31:58.960
Griffin do you not get it? Like Shaq's like huh? Just call it the pizza of Shaq. I don't understand

31:58.960 --> 32:05.120
I'm saying pizzas a possessive Shaq. This is the Shaq that pizza owns right at this point

32:05.120 --> 32:07.120
It is not Shaq's pizza, right?

32:07.120 --> 32:14.120
That means that he has control of this at this point. The pizza has such control over Shaq that this is pizza Shaq

32:15.880 --> 32:18.680
How about we do you get a questions work

32:20.600 --> 32:22.600
Pizza

32:22.880 --> 32:26.120
So I thought it was asking Shaq if he wanted pizza pizza

32:26.600 --> 32:29.640
And then it was Shaq's catchphrase runs back. Yeah, sure

32:30.280 --> 32:31.960
Sounds great

32:31.960 --> 32:35.520
Sure, I'll have some peace. I'd love to I'm

33:07.040 --> 33:12.680
Yep, and I love that they can help me send packages all over the world. I don't love having to go

33:12.680 --> 33:20.040

76% off UPS. That's a lot of her sense

I know a lot of percent so much percent and you know, it's wild they could have just made it 75

34:04.180 --> 34:06.400

37:20.860 --> 37:21.060
No

37:21.060 --> 37:27.460
We're definitely not gonna hear anything about how we made it sound like stitch fix dressed our little brother in a big diaper and tiny

37:27.460 --> 37:29.460
Shirt and tiny. That was a joke

37:29.940 --> 37:31.940
fix golly

37:31.940 --> 37:36.500
Oh, we need a way. We should just say up front. This is what my daughter does

37:36.900 --> 37:40.900
BB will say like I'm gonna tell you something funny and then she'll tell a joke

37:41.460 --> 37:45.780
As a way to like prep me to make sure I know that I'm supposed to laugh when she's done talking

37:46.340 --> 37:49.860
We should do that more on the show be like, hey this thing I'm about to say it's not real

37:49.940 --> 37:53.940
This is a joke and then tell it because it can get confusing to me or set up

37:55.300 --> 37:56.740
I don't even know

37:56.740 --> 38:02.000
This is not a joke. Okay. Thank you. Dun, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

38:07.220 --> 38:09.220
I want a much

38:10.980 --> 38:16.100
I want to munch on it feels like you don't need us for this. If you know, yeah

38:16.180 --> 38:20.180
I kind of replace you guys with bells and I'm really sorry. That's okay. I get it

38:20.900 --> 38:22.900
Yes, let's talk about Mariah Carey. Yeah

38:23.940 --> 38:25.940
Uh, well good news guys

38:25.940 --> 38:29.980
is because Mariah is taking the holidays up an octave

38:29.980 --> 38:31.940
with the 12 days of McDonald's deals.

38:31.940 --> 38:32.960
Huh, cool.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.780
Each day from December 13th to December 24th.

38:35.780 --> 38:40.700
So we got, you know, got a little bit left.

38:40.700 --> 38:44.100
All this McDonald's wants this holiday season is for you

38:45.260 --> 38:48.140
to join Mariah Carey for 12 days of deals.

38:48.140 --> 38:50.640
Wow, that's a sweaty one, isn't it?

38:50.640 --> 38:52.580
Because when, yeah, it's super sweaty.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.900
All I want for Christmas is you.

38:53.900 --> 38:54.740
Oh yeah, I get it.

38:54.740 --> 38:56.660
We'll change half those words.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.900
And then insert a preposition

38:58.900 --> 39:01.620
because we don't have the guts to just abandon it.

39:01.620 --> 39:03.600
Because when an iconic holiday superstar

39:03.600 --> 39:05.060
is a fan of the golden arches,

39:05.060 --> 39:07.580
it's only right to begin the season by gifting customers

39:07.580 --> 39:12.580
an entire menu full of free, asterisk, goodies

39:12.780 --> 39:14.740
from Mariah's own favorite.

39:17.140 --> 39:18.100
Anyone?

39:18.100 --> 39:19.500
Like her favorite thing.

39:19.500 --> 39:24.500
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say a McFlurry.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.340
Okay, Griffin?

39:26.720 --> 39:28.660
Just the hash browns.

39:28.660 --> 39:29.500
Classic cheeseburger.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.380
Oh no, there's no fucking way.

39:32.380 --> 39:34.340
I'm sorry Travis, that's what she told McDonald's

39:34.340 --> 39:35.180
to soft bake chocolate.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.140
Don't call Mariah a liar.

39:37.140 --> 39:38.820
I'm actually, you know what?

39:38.820 --> 39:39.940
She's not Malia Carey.

39:39.940 --> 39:40.780
She's Mariah Carey.

39:40.780 --> 39:42.300
I'm calling McDonald's a liar.

39:42.300 --> 39:43.820
I don't think they spoke to Mariah Carey

39:43.820 --> 39:46.500
before they started this whole thing.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.420
The Mariah menu will make its debut in the U.S.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.460
on December 13th, featuring a different free item,

39:52.460 --> 39:55.100
double asterisk.

39:55.100 --> 39:58.100
With a $1 minimum purchase on the McDonald's app.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.540
Some of my favorite memories with my kids

40:00.540 --> 40:02.540
are our family trips to McDonald's.

40:02.540 --> 40:03.380
Sure.

40:04.420 --> 40:06.340
So I'm Mariah Carey and I take my kids

40:06.340 --> 40:08.260
to McDonald's all the time and bada bada bada.

40:08.260 --> 40:11.060
Just me and my kids to McDonald's.

40:11.060 --> 40:14.540
We go to McDonald's and I always get a classic cheeseburger.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.740
This is definitely me, Mariah Carey.

40:16.740 --> 40:17.580
This is Marie Mariah Carey.

40:17.580 --> 40:21.020
Carey, I can only use the bathroom at McDonald's.

40:21.020 --> 40:25.020
The only face I've ever felt truly like a success,

40:25.020 --> 40:26.940
slash alive is McDonald's

40:26.940 --> 40:29.340
when I'm eating a classic cheeseburger.

40:32.260 --> 40:33.900
Each of us has our go-to order.

40:33.900 --> 40:35.860
Mine is the cheeseburger.

40:35.860 --> 40:38.420
And I get it with extra pickles.

40:38.420 --> 40:40.220
I'm Mariah Carey, I love extra pickles

40:40.220 --> 40:41.980
because damn it, I'm worth it.

40:41.980 --> 40:43.500
I know it costs a little bit extra,

40:43.500 --> 40:45.540
but fuck it, I'm Mariah Carey and I love pickles.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.700
Imagine a fucking reality in which

40:47.700 --> 40:50.300
someone's in the register at McDonald's

40:50.300 --> 40:51.540
and the person in front of me is like,

40:51.540 --> 40:53.660
hello, I'm Mariah Carey.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.660
I would like one cheeseburger.

40:55.660 --> 40:57.780
No drink for me today, thanks.

40:57.780 --> 41:00.780
I'd like a single cheeseburger with extra pickles.

41:00.780 --> 41:02.620
I'll wait, just put it in my hands.

41:02.620 --> 41:03.460
I don't need a wrapper.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.340
Would you like a combo meal with fries in it?

41:05.340 --> 41:08.580
No, what a fucking idiot question.

41:08.580 --> 41:10.100
No.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.420
Mariah goes with the holidays like ketchup and fries.

41:13.420 --> 41:15.220
So we couldn't think of a better partner

41:15.220 --> 41:17.940
to help us celebrate the upcoming season,

41:17.940 --> 41:19.500
said someone at McDonald's.

41:19.500 --> 41:22.140
Just like McDonald's brings people around the table

41:22.140 --> 41:23.900
with their favorite orders,

41:23.900 --> 41:28.340
Mariah's music connects us all during this time of year.

41:28.340 --> 41:29.740
So we're excited to team up

41:29.740 --> 41:33.020
to bring even more holiday cheer to our fans.

41:33.020 --> 41:35.140
And hey, I'm gonna float something to you guys

41:35.140 --> 41:36.340
because this just occurred to me.

41:36.340 --> 41:40.100
Listen, we have lots of wonderful fans and they're great,

41:40.100 --> 41:41.500
but I don't think we're big enough.

41:41.500 --> 41:45.620
I think that we could say we've partnered with Mariah Carey

41:45.620 --> 41:47.940
and like in each episode,

41:47.940 --> 41:50.180
she's gonna bring you one segment

41:50.180 --> 41:51.580
that Mariah Carey picked.

41:51.580 --> 41:52.620
And I don't think we're big enough

41:52.620 --> 41:55.020
that it would ever actually get back to Mariah Carey.

41:55.020 --> 41:58.380
I think we could totally do it and just get away with it.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.660
Can I make this sort of like vision board announcement?

42:00.660 --> 42:04.900
If you are a restaurant, a real restaurant, right?

42:04.900 --> 42:07.260
And you wanna get at us with multiple locations.

42:07.260 --> 42:09.460
It has to be more than one location.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.140
It can be a two restaurant chain

42:11.140 --> 42:14.460
and you wanna do a McElroy family meal, please get at us.

42:14.460 --> 42:16.620
It's gonna be buck wild.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.660
It'll be weird.

42:18.660 --> 42:20.900
Because I tell you this, if I get my chance,

42:20.900 --> 42:23.100
it ain't gonna be a classic cheeseburger.

42:23.100 --> 42:26.740
It's gonna be like a McFlurry dumped over fries

42:26.740 --> 42:27.940
with chopped up pickles on it.

42:27.940 --> 42:29.780
It's gonna be like you really eat it

42:29.780 --> 42:32.660
and I'm gonna be like, yeah, dance, eat it, eat it now.

42:32.660 --> 42:35.540
High school lunchroom dare bullshit.

42:35.540 --> 42:36.380
It's gonna get weird.

42:36.380 --> 42:37.540
It's gonna be all school pizza.

42:37.540 --> 42:38.980
The Mariah menu items

42:38.980 --> 42:40.580
will be served in fun festive packaging.

42:40.580 --> 42:42.380
If McDonald's wants to reach out,

42:42.380 --> 42:45.060
we're bringing back the McPizza and you can't stop us.

42:45.060 --> 42:47.300
Yeah, we worked with Mariah to create a design.

42:47.300 --> 42:50.580
We know the Lamborghini and McDonald's fans will love.

42:50.580 --> 42:52.140
You'll know the bags when you see them.

42:52.140 --> 42:54.060
Just like, you know, her famed holiday jingle

42:54.060 --> 42:55.500
from the song's first notes.

42:57.580 --> 42:59.620
Hey, I want you guys to just picture it for a second.

42:59.620 --> 43:04.620
Mariah Carey, like sitting over like an artist easel

43:04.860 --> 43:07.260
and like just trying to design this bag

43:07.260 --> 43:08.540
and she just can't get it right.

43:08.540 --> 43:11.100
Cause that's definitely what it might've also been

43:11.100 --> 43:14.780
like a big fancy iPad with like a thing,

43:14.780 --> 43:16.740
but definitely this is something Mariah Carey

43:16.740 --> 43:18.980
definitely directly worked on.

43:18.980 --> 43:20.980
But using the wifi at McDonald's.

43:20.980 --> 43:23.260
Using the wifi at McDonald's.

43:23.260 --> 43:24.580
Hey, good news guys.

43:24.580 --> 43:26.820
I wanna talk about Mariah Carey.

43:26.820 --> 43:29.980
Mariah Carey has released the holiday hits cookie trio.

43:29.980 --> 43:31.100
Wait.

43:31.100 --> 43:33.620
Just in time for the holidays, Mariah's cookies,

43:33.620 --> 43:36.780
a virtual bakery by iconic superstar, Mariah Carey.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.940
They're virtual cookies?

43:38.940 --> 43:40.020
No, they're real.

43:40.020 --> 43:41.180
Yes, they're virtual cookies.

43:41.180 --> 43:44.460
You get them from any website installed on your computer.

43:44.460 --> 43:45.660
Mariah's got these cookies?

43:45.660 --> 43:46.500
That sounds delicious.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.220
Holiday hits cookies?

43:48.220 --> 43:50.340
Holiday hits cookie trio available

43:50.340 --> 43:51.860
for the most wonderful time of the year.

43:51.860 --> 43:54.380
Because she wrote holiday hits?

43:54.380 --> 43:55.460
Yeah, so she's got a,

43:55.460 --> 43:58.100
from her virtual bakery at Mariah's Cookies,

43:58.100 --> 43:59.460
you could get this virtual.

43:59.460 --> 44:02.180
Now they say that this deal is for the holidays.

44:02.180 --> 44:05.220
I have to imagine Mariah's Cookies is for the holidays,

44:05.220 --> 44:06.060
right?

44:06.060 --> 44:07.380
You're not in July like,

44:07.380 --> 44:10.660
God damn, I should go for some of Mariah's Cookies right now.

44:10.660 --> 44:13.700
If they're that good, this is what's called a soft roll.

44:13.700 --> 44:16.940
I can't get over that they're just called holiday hits.

44:16.940 --> 44:17.780
It would be like-

44:17.780 --> 44:19.100
They're the holiday hits cookie trio.

44:19.100 --> 44:19.940
It would be like if,

44:19.940 --> 44:24.820
these are Pete Townshend's sick riffs, McFlurries.

44:24.820 --> 44:25.740
This is-

44:25.740 --> 44:27.460
I don't think this is still a McDonald's, right?

44:27.460 --> 44:28.380
This is not a McDonald's anymore.

44:28.380 --> 44:30.820
No, this is a different, no, this is at Mariah's Cookies,

44:30.820 --> 44:32.700
a real restaurant that is not real.

44:32.700 --> 44:33.540
Okay.

44:33.540 --> 44:34.380
We-

44:34.380 --> 44:36.380
Something that exists only in Tron.

44:36.380 --> 44:38.780
Yeah, this year's release of holiday flavors

44:38.780 --> 44:40.580
are the ideal treat to share and enjoy

44:40.580 --> 44:42.540
while snuggled up with your loved ones.

44:42.540 --> 44:44.500
Watch your favorite holiday specials and movies.

44:44.500 --> 44:47.980
Enjoy this classic cheeseburger flavored cookie.

44:47.980 --> 44:49.700
We forgot to leave, this is a quote,

44:49.700 --> 44:51.700
we forgot to leave cookies out for Santa last year.

44:51.700 --> 44:52.780
Fuck!

44:52.780 --> 44:54.860
And we're terrified we'd wind up on the naughty list,

44:54.860 --> 44:55.980
says Mariah Carey.

44:55.980 --> 44:57.220
Wow.

44:57.220 --> 44:58.620
To no one in particular.

44:58.620 --> 45:02.020
Mariah, you just lived with this shame and guilt for a year?

45:02.020 --> 45:04.140
So, this is where it really goes.

45:04.140 --> 45:07.220
So we FaceTimed him over the summer

45:07.220 --> 45:09.580
to ensure we got his top three flavors.

45:09.580 --> 45:12.020
Santa, please, please, you gotta forgive us.

45:12.020 --> 45:15.580
In case you were wondering, here they are.

45:15.580 --> 45:18.860
The Holiday Hits Cookie Trio, 2021,

45:18.860 --> 45:20.780
available for a limited time only.

45:20.780 --> 45:22.380
No shit.

45:22.380 --> 45:23.740
Cause it is called the Holiday Hits Trio.

45:23.740 --> 45:26.020
Well, that could be anything, Justin.

45:26.020 --> 45:28.900
It includes three special edition flavors,

45:28.900 --> 45:30.540
gingerbread, cinnamon sugar,

45:30.540 --> 45:31.500
and chocolate raspberry-

45:31.500 --> 45:32.420
Special edition.

45:32.420 --> 45:36.100
You'll never find gingerbread anywhere else.

45:36.100 --> 45:38.300
It's got a festive box, too.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.340
So, I'm sorry.

45:41.340 --> 45:43.100
It was gingerbread, cinnamon sugar,

45:43.100 --> 45:44.500
and what was the third one?

45:44.500 --> 45:46.740
Yeah, chocolate raspberry truffle.

45:46.740 --> 45:48.140
That's actually pretty wild.

45:48.140 --> 45:49.380
I like that one.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.260
Hey, it's just Santa's favorite.

45:51.260 --> 45:54.420
There's no way that you asked Santa his favorite cookie

45:54.420 --> 45:56.820
and he's like, fucking gingerbread, my dude.

45:56.820 --> 45:57.660
I love it.

45:57.660 --> 45:59.340
I can't get enough of that wonderful stuff.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.900
So yeah, these are Mariah's cookies and-

46:01.900 --> 46:04.460
Do you think she makes each one?

46:04.460 --> 46:06.460
I don't know if you can get Mariah's cookies.

46:06.460 --> 46:08.340
Okay, I can't get them.

46:08.340 --> 46:09.340
Can I?

46:09.340 --> 46:10.700
Yeah, looks like you could.

46:10.700 --> 46:12.260
If you got on a delivery app,

46:12.260 --> 46:13.460
you could probably get some of Mariah's cookies.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.100
I live in the big city.

46:15.100 --> 46:16.700
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind ordering those, Trav,

46:16.700 --> 46:17.820
and just let me know how it goes.

46:17.820 --> 46:20.260
They taste exactly like gingerbread cookies, Justin.

46:20.260 --> 46:21.620
And I want you to really order them, Trav,

46:21.620 --> 46:22.460
for me for the holidays.

46:22.460 --> 46:23.300
Thank you.

46:23.300 --> 46:25.420
Through any delivery service, you say?

46:25.420 --> 46:27.620
Grubhub, DoorDash, Postmates, Ubreats, and Seamless.

46:27.620 --> 46:31.500
Okay, I'll order one from each of those.

46:31.500 --> 46:32.580
So I don't shut down-

46:32.580 --> 46:33.580
Okay.

46:33.580 --> 46:34.700
Do you guys mind, real quick,

46:34.700 --> 46:36.620
if I mention a quick Mariah Carey story?

46:36.620 --> 46:37.460
Yeah.

46:37.460 --> 46:39.940
She just launched her first holiday collection today,

46:39.940 --> 46:41.540
announcing the news with a commercial share

46:41.540 --> 46:43.380
across all Carey's social accounts.

46:43.380 --> 46:45.060
It's available at Target and Walmart,

46:45.060 --> 46:46.820
and it's inspired by, you'll never guess this,

46:46.820 --> 46:49.780
her record-breaking classic, All I Want for Christmas Is You.

46:49.780 --> 46:51.980
It's got animated versions of Mariah

46:51.980 --> 46:55.700
and her beloved dog, Cha Cha, incorporated throughout.

46:55.700 --> 46:57.700
The collection is personal to Carey, you see.

46:57.700 --> 46:59.620
She has designed products that she and her family

46:59.620 --> 47:02.140
love to use and enjoy during the holidays.

47:02.140 --> 47:07.140
This is a special jewel-encrusted purse

47:07.860 --> 47:10.260
I use to carry my cheeseburger with me.

47:10.260 --> 47:11.100
I love it.

47:12.020 --> 47:12.860
It's my favorite.

47:12.860 --> 47:14.340
This is a cheeseburger sleeve,

47:14.340 --> 47:16.500
so I don't have to touch it with my hands.

47:18.900 --> 47:21.980
I'm not sure if you're aware, but this is a quote.

47:21.980 --> 47:23.100
I'm not sure if you're aware,

47:23.100 --> 47:24.780
but Christmas is kind of my thing.

47:24.780 --> 47:25.620
What?

47:25.620 --> 47:26.460
Ha ha!

47:26.460 --> 47:28.420
Putting together this line was so much fun,

47:28.420 --> 47:30.460
because I added my own festive spin

47:30.460 --> 47:31.980
to traditional holiday merchandise.

47:31.980 --> 47:33.620
I worked on it all year long.

47:33.620 --> 47:36.140
Now it's finally time to share my holiday collection

47:36.140 --> 47:38.020
with you, all Merry Christmas.

47:38.020 --> 47:39.180
Now, hey, listen, Mariah,

47:39.180 --> 47:40.700
I know you didn't work on it all year long,

47:40.700 --> 47:41.860
or else you didn't work very hard

47:41.860 --> 47:43.740
on your cookies and hamburgers.

47:43.740 --> 47:45.700
Well, she don't have to work on the hamburger, Justin.

47:45.700 --> 47:47.620
That's her reward.

47:47.620 --> 47:50.580
That's her treat herself for a great day

47:50.580 --> 47:52.100
of making goods at Walmart.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.620
That's her thing just for her.

47:53.620 --> 47:57.100
She needs that cheeseburger energy to make cool bags.

47:57.100 --> 48:00.540
The holiday collection of Christmas collectibles ranges,

48:00.540 --> 48:02.020
that's the sentence they went with.

48:02.020 --> 48:03.860
The holiday collection of Christmas collectibles

48:03.860 --> 48:06.820
ranges from cozy, including blankets, throw pillows,

48:06.820 --> 48:08.700
socks, and slippers, to festive,

48:08.700 --> 48:11.180
with adorable pet outfits, stockings.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.420
Oh, this?

48:12.420 --> 48:13.820
It's by Mariah.

48:13.820 --> 48:15.260
This Chihuahua outfit?

48:15.260 --> 48:17.180
Oh, this Chihuahua outfit?

48:17.180 --> 48:19.700
They got a plush Mariah and Cha-Cha.

48:19.700 --> 48:22.420
Sure to delight any child on your Christmas list.

48:23.300 --> 48:26.940
It's all available for you at Target or Walmart.

48:26.940 --> 48:27.860
You can pre-order now.

48:27.860 --> 48:29.980
Justin, I ordered the cookies.

48:29.980 --> 48:31.340
And I look forward to having them

48:31.340 --> 48:33.020
as a special treat just for me.

48:33.020 --> 48:34.460
And I bought the dog shirt.

48:35.780 --> 48:36.780
I bought her dog.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.500
Real quick, okay, before we wrap up,

48:40.500 --> 48:42.340
can I do one more quick story?

48:42.340 --> 48:43.860
Is it about Mariah Carey?

48:43.860 --> 48:44.700
It is.

48:44.700 --> 48:47.580
Mariah Carey has launched her own Irish cream brand,

48:47.580 --> 48:48.420
Black Iris.

48:48.420 --> 48:49.260
What, yes?

48:50.900 --> 48:53.940
And just so you know I'm not cherry picking, guys,

48:53.940 --> 48:58.940
this is all, I mean, these are this year.

48:58.940 --> 49:00.380
This all happened this year.

49:00.380 --> 49:01.220
Yeah, she's hustling.

49:01.220 --> 49:03.180
She is not fucking around.

49:03.180 --> 49:07.500
She has to earn money to buy more classic cheeseburgers.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.380
She can't sit back and let those cheeseburgers

49:10.380 --> 49:12.300
just sit there lonely at the McDonald's.

49:12.300 --> 49:13.420
She has to eat them.

49:15.460 --> 49:17.780
Celebrity owned, this is not a press release.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.620
This is a story from Food and Wine,

49:19.620 --> 49:21.580
but celebrity owned spirit brands.

49:21.580 --> 49:22.420
This is not a press release.

49:22.420 --> 49:25.620
This was a direct email Justin received from Mariah Carey.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.340
In 2018, George Clooney was named

49:27.340 --> 49:31.580
Forbes highest paid actor, not due to any onscreen roles,

49:31.580 --> 49:35.860
but instead, thanks to the near billion dollar sale

49:35.860 --> 49:38.340
of his tequila brand, Casamigos.

49:38.340 --> 49:39.180
That shouldn't count.

49:39.180 --> 49:41.020
Just in case anyone's wondering,

49:41.020 --> 49:43.300
that shouldn't count towards that total.

49:43.300 --> 49:44.820
That doesn't seem fair.

49:44.820 --> 49:49.820
Ryan Reynolds Aviation, it sold for about 610 million.

49:50.220 --> 49:52.140
And now Mariah Carey is there.

49:52.140 --> 49:54.420
Yesterday, she turned to Twitter to make a big announcement

49:54.420 --> 49:57.460
with limited details, introducing Black Irish.

49:57.460 --> 49:59.580
She tweeted, two years in the making

49:59.580 --> 50:01.900
truly calls for celebration.

50:01.900 --> 50:04.300
The picture is just Mariah on a beach

50:04.300 --> 50:06.140
with a bottle of her Black Irish.

50:06.140 --> 50:08.100
Because where else, where do you want

50:08.100 --> 50:12.340
a cream liqueur more than the beach beach liqueur?

50:12.340 --> 50:17.340
A nice cool glass of Irish cream liqueur.

50:17.340 --> 50:20.260
It comes in original white chocolate and salted caramel,

50:20.260 --> 50:23.100
all of which are 17% ABV.

50:23.100 --> 50:25.180
The brand states that these Irish creams

50:25.180 --> 50:27.780
are crafted and produced in Ireland

50:27.780 --> 50:30.700
in a certified sustainable facility

50:30.700 --> 50:32.980
with 50% renewable energy.

50:32.980 --> 50:35.100
Now y'all, the other 50% though,

50:35.100 --> 50:37.020
is the dirtiest energy.

50:37.020 --> 50:39.460
They are rolling coal with this Irish cream.

50:39.460 --> 50:41.900
It's still whole dinosaur bones

50:41.900 --> 50:43.820
just going right in and burning.

50:43.820 --> 50:46.180
It celebrates exceptional quality

50:46.180 --> 50:48.700
with a blend of aged Irish whiskey

50:48.700 --> 50:52.220
and superior deli, dairy, deli.

50:52.220 --> 50:56.460
Why does deli need some fucking corned beef in there?

50:56.460 --> 51:01.020
No, the superior dairy sourced from Irish farms.

51:01.020 --> 51:02.460
Black Irish white chocolate

51:02.460 --> 51:04.100
uses the finest Belgian chocolate

51:04.100 --> 51:06.460
for a rich and smooth taste.

51:06.460 --> 51:09.060
The name Carrie chose Black Irish

51:09.060 --> 51:12.220
as a playful nod to her Black and Irish heritage.

51:12.220 --> 51:14.740
Her father was of Black and Venezuelan descent

51:14.740 --> 51:17.020
and her mother has an Irish background.

51:17.020 --> 51:19.540
The fact that the liqueur itself, an Irish cream,

51:19.540 --> 51:21.580
feels a bit like a chicken or the egg situation

51:21.580 --> 51:24.700
as far as which came first, the name or the product.

51:24.700 --> 51:26.820
But the brand states that Carrie is quote,

51:26.820 --> 51:31.460
is quote, a fan of Irish creams.

51:31.460 --> 51:32.300
Love that stuff.

51:32.300 --> 51:34.140
And points to how well Irish cream

51:34.140 --> 51:36.140
pairs with her huge holiday hit,

51:36.140 --> 51:37.940
All I Want For Christmas Is You.

51:37.940 --> 51:39.140
Yes, yes, yes.

51:39.140 --> 51:40.740
I just wanna say, by the way,

51:40.740 --> 51:44.700
a story that the phrase has an Irish background

51:44.700 --> 51:46.860
sounds like something you would put on a resume

51:46.860 --> 51:48.420
about like, oh, actually,

51:48.420 --> 51:50.180
I know you're looking for someone Irish.

51:50.180 --> 51:51.980
I have an Irish background.

51:51.980 --> 51:53.740
I've worked in Irish before.

51:53.740 --> 51:54.660
Thank you for asking.

51:54.660 --> 51:56.740
I have quote, here's a quote,

51:56.740 --> 51:58.260
because you knew it was coming.

51:58.260 --> 52:00.900
I have been putting my heart into this project

52:00.900 --> 52:02.740
for almost two years.

52:02.740 --> 52:03.580
Hey, can I just say,

52:03.580 --> 52:06.380
that's the first one of those of these four that I believe.

52:06.380 --> 52:08.660
Now, but yeah, but we also,

52:08.660 --> 52:10.540
I mean, Mariah, which is it, bud?

52:10.540 --> 52:13.700
Because either you've been really focused on your creams

52:13.700 --> 52:15.900
or really focused on your dog shirts, ladies.

52:15.900 --> 52:16.740
It can't be both.

52:16.740 --> 52:18.980
Anyway, I've been putting my heart into this project

52:18.980 --> 52:20.340
for almost two years.

52:20.340 --> 52:23.700
And I am so excited to finally share this news with you all.

52:23.700 --> 52:26.060
I wanted to create something that embodies the holidays

52:26.060 --> 52:28.500
and gives everyone a reason to celebrate year round.

52:28.500 --> 52:31.060
And I really think that we have done that with Black Irish.

52:31.060 --> 52:32.420
Why are you celebrating today, Justin?

52:32.420 --> 52:35.060
Well, I'm celebrating because Mariah Carey

52:35.060 --> 52:37.300
has her own Irish cream bread.

52:37.300 --> 52:38.140
And she deserves it.

52:38.140 --> 52:39.300
That's my reason to celebrate.

52:39.300 --> 52:41.540
Hey, Mariah, do these pair well with your cookies?

52:41.540 --> 52:42.620
With my what?

52:42.620 --> 52:43.460
Wait, what's that?

52:43.460 --> 52:46.580
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cookies.

52:46.580 --> 52:49.500
The cookies that they pay me in cheeseburgers for.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.340
Yes.

52:50.340 --> 52:52.660
My favorite meal to sit down to

52:52.660 --> 52:54.500
is a big glass of Irish cream.

52:54.500 --> 52:55.500
Served out of a purse.

52:55.500 --> 52:58.340
With a cheeseburger with extra pickles

52:58.340 --> 52:59.900
and a big stack of cookies.

52:59.900 --> 53:02.060
And I, in all Santa's favorite flavors.

53:02.060 --> 53:03.660
I slosh it around in my big purse.

53:03.660 --> 53:04.500
I bet it's good.

53:04.500 --> 53:05.340
And then I eat it all.

53:05.340 --> 53:07.020
I bet all of this is very good.

53:07.900 --> 53:11.660
Mariah Carey is like, you gotta respect her so much.

53:11.660 --> 53:12.900
I do.

53:12.900 --> 53:16.740
If we had one song that was one 10th,

53:16.740 --> 53:19.140
you would never hear the end.

53:19.140 --> 53:19.980
No.

53:19.980 --> 53:20.820
We would do this with everybody.

53:20.820 --> 53:23.940
If we had a novelty hit, like the fucking Chipmunks,

53:23.940 --> 53:26.300
you wouldn't be able to talk to me in public.

53:26.300 --> 53:28.020
Yeah, sure.

53:28.020 --> 53:28.860
Yeah.

53:31.340 --> 53:32.180
What do we have time for?

53:32.180 --> 53:33.020
We gonna time to have another question?

53:33.020 --> 53:35.260
I think we have time to read a hit holiday song, Justin.

53:35.260 --> 53:36.100
Okay.

53:36.100 --> 53:37.460
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

53:37.460 --> 53:38.300
All I want.

53:38.300 --> 53:39.140
Nope.

53:39.140 --> 53:39.980
Wait.

53:39.980 --> 53:40.980
They already did that one.

53:40.980 --> 53:42.060
Is.

53:42.060 --> 53:42.900
Cheese.

53:42.900 --> 53:43.740
Cheese.

53:43.740 --> 53:44.580
Cheese.

53:44.580 --> 53:45.540
Take me up to Santa's house.

53:45.540 --> 53:46.380
Here we go.

53:46.380 --> 53:48.540
I think it should be like an old-timey.

53:48.540 --> 53:49.380
Let's do it.

53:49.380 --> 53:50.220
We gonna bring out a quick.

53:50.220 --> 53:53.100
Let's go back to like old-timey ones

53:53.100 --> 53:55.180
where it's like, hey, it's snowing outside.

53:55.180 --> 53:57.700
Here's a whole fucking song about it.

53:57.700 --> 53:58.540
We'll start.

53:58.540 --> 53:59.380
Just start that.

53:59.380 --> 54:01.940
I won't interrupt, but like start it there.

54:01.940 --> 54:03.420
We'll just get a little riff.

54:03.420 --> 54:04.260
Yeah.

54:04.260 --> 54:05.940
I'm putting on my Christmas boots to step.

54:05.940 --> 54:08.140
No, that's not how you started just now.

54:08.140 --> 54:08.980
It's like.

54:08.980 --> 54:12.420
Let's go on up to Santa's house.

54:12.420 --> 54:14.260
It's snowing in the neighborhood.

54:14.260 --> 54:15.300
You've jumped to the chorus.

54:15.300 --> 54:16.140
Yeah, you gotta start with it.

54:16.140 --> 54:16.980
I like the spoken part.

54:16.980 --> 54:17.820
You gotta start with.

54:17.820 --> 54:18.660
Let me start.

54:18.660 --> 54:19.500
God damn it.

54:19.500 --> 54:20.340
A little boozy.

54:20.340 --> 54:21.180
A little boozy.

54:21.180 --> 54:22.020
The kids are asleep.

54:22.020 --> 54:22.860
You know what I mean?

54:22.860 --> 54:24.220
Oh, it's snowing outside and.

54:24.220 --> 54:25.060
No, it's talking.

54:25.060 --> 54:25.900
It's spoken word.

54:25.900 --> 54:27.060
Just say, well, it's snowing outside.

54:27.060 --> 54:27.900
Well, it looks like.

54:27.900 --> 54:29.420
Yeah, just like you did it the first time.

54:29.420 --> 54:31.860
Well, it looks like a snowy day outside.

54:31.860 --> 54:34.020
Sloshy, sloppy, and wet.

54:34.020 --> 54:37.300
And today, it's Christmas Eve.

54:37.300 --> 54:39.100
And it's special.

54:41.140 --> 54:42.820
Isn't that right, Jacob?

54:42.820 --> 54:44.260
Yeah.

54:44.260 --> 54:46.100
That's my friend, Jacob.

54:47.300 --> 54:49.980
Going up to Santa's house.

54:49.980 --> 54:51.700
Santa's house.

54:51.700 --> 54:55.100
Driving up in my Chevrolet.

54:55.100 --> 54:58.740
I got snow chains on my tires.

54:58.740 --> 55:02.180
And I think that that's okay.

55:02.180 --> 55:05.060
I found the perfect gift for Saint Nick.

55:05.060 --> 55:08.260
It's a real nice fitting pair of slacks

55:08.260 --> 55:11.340
and a briefcase so he can go to a job

55:11.340 --> 55:14.660
that's a different job from the one he has.

55:14.660 --> 55:16.020
And I'm Jacob.

55:16.020 --> 55:17.420
And now the wrap.

55:17.420 --> 55:19.180
I love Christmas and I'm here to say

55:19.180 --> 55:21.020
I love giving presents in a major way.

55:21.020 --> 55:23.500
I unwrap them, I open them, and I eat some food.

55:23.500 --> 55:26.420
And everything here is really good.

55:26.420 --> 55:28.340
Fresh stuff, Jacob.

55:28.340 --> 55:35.540
Thanks, I've been trading for months.

55:35.540 --> 55:38.780
Oh no, here come the turbo bots.

55:38.780 --> 55:41.620
They hate Santa Claus and hate us too.

55:41.620 --> 55:43.860
They hate our freedom.

55:43.860 --> 55:45.460
Jacob, take this gun.

55:45.460 --> 55:48.820
There's bullets in the red, in the box.

55:48.820 --> 55:51.940
And I think Jacob knows what to do.

55:51.940 --> 55:55.620
Hey everybody, it's me, Mariah Carey.

55:55.620 --> 55:58.420
These are the bots that I created.

55:58.420 --> 56:01.100
I'm so proud of my killer robots.

56:01.100 --> 56:03.500
They're gonna destroy every living thing.

56:03.500 --> 56:06.260
So if I go down, I want you to find my wife

56:06.260 --> 56:07.620
and tell her where the money's buried.

56:07.620 --> 56:10.300
You promise me, Jacob, you promise me.

56:10.300 --> 56:11.860
Okay, let's get out there.

56:11.860 --> 56:15.020
Damn, this snow is really fucking slushy.

56:15.020 --> 56:17.900
Driving all around and whipping all around.

56:17.900 --> 56:19.620
We are the turbo bots.

56:19.620 --> 56:21.380
We hate Santa Claus.

56:22.980 --> 56:24.220
That's all I got.

56:24.220 --> 56:27.020
The turbo bots have got some slushy snow

56:27.020 --> 56:29.620
trapped inside their gears.

56:29.620 --> 56:32.660
Looks like we are safe at home.

56:32.660 --> 56:35.140
Cozy for another year.

56:35.140 --> 56:37.500
But stay wary, cause the bots will return, everybody.

56:37.500 --> 56:38.500
They will come back.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.740
They'll come back worse than ever.

56:40.740 --> 56:42.260
And that's good.

56:42.260 --> 56:43.100
It's good.

56:43.100 --> 56:44.620
Hey, thanks for listening to our podcast,

56:44.620 --> 56:45.620
my brother, my brother, and me.

56:45.620 --> 56:48.740
And happy holidays, candle lights, to you and yours.

56:48.740 --> 56:50.420
We hope you're having a pleasant holiday season.

56:50.420 --> 56:51.980
Hey, speaking of which,

56:51.980 --> 56:54.140
the video on demand is still up of our candle lights.

56:54.140 --> 56:55.180
Show.

56:55.180 --> 56:56.420
Yes, please.

56:56.420 --> 56:58.340
If you didn't get it, it's so fun.

56:58.340 --> 57:01.380
It's over two hours of great festive holiday entertainment.

57:01.380 --> 57:03.380
It will be live for another,

57:03.380 --> 57:04.460
it's hard for me to do the math.

57:04.460 --> 57:05.900
It's like a week and a half or so

57:05.900 --> 57:07.220
as you're listening to this, I think.

57:07.220 --> 57:10.980
So please just go pony up some money for it and help.

57:10.980 --> 57:12.220
It's a great cause, Harmony House.

57:12.220 --> 57:15.220
They do so much for people

57:15.220 --> 57:17.860
who are currently unsheltered in our community

57:17.860 --> 57:19.580
and it's a wonderful cause.

57:19.580 --> 57:21.580
And if you would just go to bit.ly forward slash

57:21.580 --> 57:24.100
candle lights 2021, everybody who watched it,

57:24.100 --> 57:27.220
I can say to a person had a wonderful time

57:27.220 --> 57:29.580
and now you could count yourself amongst their number

57:29.580 --> 57:32.820
if you will go and get that and watch it.

57:32.820 --> 57:33.660
We really appreciate you.

57:33.660 --> 57:34.700
Speaking of shows,

57:34.700 --> 57:37.260
we're doing a virtual live stream for Wonderful,

57:37.260 --> 57:39.940
the show me and Rachel do on January 7th

57:39.940 --> 57:43.140
at 9.30 PM Eastern time.

57:44.020 --> 57:45.340
Same thing as candle lights,

57:45.340 --> 57:47.700
tickets are five bucks with an option to give more.

57:47.700 --> 57:51.540
It's bit.ly slash wonderful ABC 2021.

57:51.540 --> 57:54.380
And ticket sales for that go to benefit Austin Batcave,

57:54.380 --> 57:56.620
which is a nonprofit here in town

57:56.620 --> 57:58.700
that offers writing programs for young authors,

57:58.700 --> 57:59.660
aged six to 18.

57:59.660 --> 58:01.460
It's a really, really cool program

58:01.460 --> 58:04.100
and we're happy to be supporting them with a show.

58:04.100 --> 58:07.020
So buy tickets so the money can go to them.

58:07.020 --> 58:07.860
Thanks.

58:07.860 --> 58:10.260
Also just a heads up to let everybody know,

58:10.260 --> 58:13.660
we will be taking next week off for the holidays.

58:13.660 --> 58:17.100
So we will be back in the new year with new episodes.

58:17.100 --> 58:19.900
So we got a name 2022, don't we?

58:19.900 --> 58:20.900
Yeah, we'll figure that out,

58:20.900 --> 58:23.500
but there will be no new episodes next week.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.220
But before the month runs out,

58:25.220 --> 58:27.100
make sure you go over to mackerelmunch.com,

58:27.100 --> 58:28.140
get that pin of the month,

58:28.140 --> 58:31.820
which is Steely Van from the Adventure Zone,

58:31.820 --> 58:34.980
benefits the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

58:34.980 --> 58:36.900
We have the my brother, my brother

58:36.900 --> 58:39.340
and the man who ruined my for you page sticker.

58:39.340 --> 58:42.300
And we've got the Zona Adventure enamel pin.

58:42.300 --> 58:43.140
So go check those out.

58:43.140 --> 58:44.700
We got a bunch of other stuff over there too.

58:44.700 --> 58:46.340
Mackerelmunch.com.

58:46.340 --> 58:49.780
Oh, and thank you.

58:49.780 --> 58:53.380
And just an enormous thank you to Montaigne.

58:53.380 --> 58:54.940
I don't know what just happened to me just there.

58:54.940 --> 58:56.140
That was kind of strange.

58:56.140 --> 58:58.060
You were awash with emotion.

58:58.060 --> 58:58.900
I guess so.

58:58.900 --> 58:59.980
It's an amazing song.

58:59.980 --> 59:02.020
We appreciate it so much.

59:02.020 --> 59:07.020
And this final Yahoo was sent in by Terrence Howard.

59:09.260 --> 59:10.100
Whoa.

59:10.100 --> 59:10.940
Wow.

59:10.940 --> 59:11.780
Huge gift.

59:11.780 --> 59:13.660
Yeah, we're getting the same, the one from movies.

59:13.660 --> 59:16.700
Like the original War Machine.

59:16.700 --> 59:18.140
Yeah, Terrence Howard sent this one.

59:18.140 --> 59:18.980
And thank you, Terrence.

59:18.980 --> 59:23.980
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user, Frederick Circus.

59:26.420 --> 59:30.940
Frederick Circus asks, will you marry me, Sheila?

59:32.620 --> 59:33.460
That's it?

59:33.460 --> 59:34.540
That's all it says, yeah.

59:34.540 --> 59:36.060
No details given?

59:36.060 --> 59:37.140
It's a Yahoo Answers proposal.

59:37.140 --> 59:37.980
I guess it's not that funny.

59:37.980 --> 59:38.980
Are there any answers?

59:40.820 --> 59:42.220
Sheila did respond.

59:42.220 --> 59:44.460
She said, not yet.

59:44.460 --> 59:45.300
Oh.

59:46.300 --> 59:47.140
Oh, it's spicy.

59:47.140 --> 59:47.980
I can't wait to see it.

59:47.980 --> 59:49.380
Oh, I like that.

59:49.380 --> 59:51.300
We'll circle back next week to figure out

59:51.300 --> 59:52.340
how this all plays out.

59:52.340 --> 59:53.180
Yeah.

59:53.180 --> 59:55.020
I can't believe, can I just say real quick

59:55.020 --> 59:55.900
before we say our names,

59:55.900 --> 59:57.620
I can't believe there's a Matrix movie coming out.

59:57.620 --> 59:58.660
I'm so fucking stoked.

59:58.660 --> 59:59.500

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:04.900
Anyway.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.940
I mean, we could still talk about it,

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:06.900
just the three of us.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.140
