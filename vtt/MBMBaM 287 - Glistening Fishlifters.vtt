00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.360
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother meeting advice show for the

00:47.360 --> 00:52.880
modern era. My name is Justin Mc... I'm gonna get this right. No, that was it.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.160
No, he's got to say, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Aw, damn. That's not it.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.960
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother meeting advice show for the

01:00.960 --> 01:04.240
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

01:04.240 --> 01:08.560
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. No fooling around with this intro.

01:08.560 --> 01:13.120
No, straight to the point, no faking. Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon.

01:14.640 --> 01:18.880
What's that noise? That's Justin being very cold. Justin, how's the weather where you are?

01:18.880 --> 01:30.640
Thanks for asking, Travis. It is a tropical winter storm. Jareth is having its way with us

01:31.520 --> 01:40.240
right now, and let me tell you guys, winter prep is so important when you're in blizzard

01:40.240 --> 01:49.520
conditions. Light or death. I almost wasn't ready. Oh, no. But listen, I don't want you to worry. I

01:49.520 --> 02:00.000
am now sitting here with a, I would guess, 20 to 25 ASMR videos just stacked. That'll get you

02:00.000 --> 02:06.400
through. Yeah, I loaded the hard drive. I got an external hard drive. How big are these fucking

02:06.400 --> 02:15.360
ASMR videos? How big is the hard drive? I get them in HHD. That's just high, high definition?

02:15.360 --> 02:23.360
High, high definition. As far as winter prep goes, I've got probably 25 ASMR videos.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.440
I'm glad that you've been listening to Bunker Buddies because when we did our winter prep

02:27.440 --> 02:32.400
episode, we said the number one priority was ASMR because what you don't want to do is wait

02:32.400 --> 02:37.280
till the storm hits and then everyone's rushing to the store like, wait, here's the ASMR videos.

02:37.280 --> 02:42.640
And it's just like, we sold out of those weeks ago. See, for my money, I like, because you're

02:42.640 --> 02:49.840
going to be trapped inside for, God, months potentially, I like the idea of just me and the

02:49.840 --> 02:55.360
kids and we all get together and we make our own ASMR videos. We get some crinkly paper. We get some

02:55.360 --> 02:59.920
crinkly paper of our own and we talk really, really soft up close on a microphone together.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.520
Get some press on nails to tap on a wooden table.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.640
Kind of dig your fingers through those glass beads that you put in aquariums.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.200
That sounds actually pretty good, Travis.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.360
Well, the last thing you want to do, especially if you're trapped in the house, is get some like

03:15.360 --> 03:19.760
cut rate bargain basement ASMR videos where it's just like a dude being like,

03:19.760 --> 03:23.680
I'm going to rub your head. Like you don't want that. You know, you want like,

03:23.680 --> 03:29.120
if you're going to be listening to it for years, possibly, you want it to be like the best quality

03:29.120 --> 03:32.160
you can get. And that's why I always do glass beads.

03:32.160 --> 03:36.800
In the last, in the last winter storm we had, I wasn't prepared and I bought some

03:36.800 --> 03:41.520
unlicensed ASMR from a guy at a dark alleyway and it turned out to just be

03:41.520 --> 03:44.400
Wendy's training videos for how to use the shake machine.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.520
That's not a trigger.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.400
Buddy, buddy, buddy, you're looking for some soft sounds.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.680
Soft sounds over here.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.160
Soft sounds, soft serve. Get over here, my man.

03:54.160 --> 03:58.240
He kind of spoke in ASMR, which is pretty amazing.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.920
Which is my trigger. Back alley ASMR is actually one of my triggers.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.760
Ah, damn it. I forgot food.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.760
Well, shit.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.040
You're going to have to eat your cat.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.400
Going to have to eat my food.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.200
Going to alf it up.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.200
Alfin it up. I said, what?

04:13.200 --> 04:17.280
Listen, the only thing that's going to get you through now, Justin, is you have to lower your

04:17.280 --> 04:23.280
heart rate and your intake consumption levels to a very, very low, like just barely alive point.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.880
Like you're going to need to get into a bathtub. And I think actually the ASMR videos

04:26.880 --> 04:29.680
might help you out with this to just to get you on that bliss.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.280
But then you're going to have some videos to bring you back from the point of death.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.760
Some like heavy metal monster truck kind of thing to get the blood rate,

04:37.760 --> 04:40.000
you know, back up once like June hits.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.680
Just a monster truck just driving over a bunch of different heavy metal bands.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.520
I've, uh, I'm, uh,

04:45.520 --> 04:48.160
A snuff film of heavy metal bands.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.480
Which is the natural opposite to ASMR.

04:50.480 --> 04:50.880
Yes.

04:50.880 --> 04:55.440
I am conserving my ASMR videos too. I'm trying to make, not use them all up.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.120
So I got the window shrugged down.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.280
So I'm only seeking about a quarter of, of them as I'm watching them.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.080
Cause I don't want to burn through them all, all at once.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.720
You know, that seems foolhardy just cause I got a big stack.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.080
You know what sucks is I'm in, I'm in Texas and the weather here is great, but I still,

05:10.080 --> 05:12.320
you know, I don't like to leave the house basically ever.

05:12.320 --> 05:18.880
Um, so last time I was out at the store, I bought like 40 hams, but I didn't get any ASMR videos.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.160
That's so stupid.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.800
Listen, let's get on with the advice.

05:22.800 --> 05:30.160
I feel my generator's about to die and I have to save enough energy to watch ASMR videos for

05:30.160 --> 05:31.280
the rest of the weekend.

05:31.280 --> 05:31.760
Yeah, sure.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.320
So I really, are you doing okay though?

05:34.320 --> 05:35.440
This is the real brother part.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.520
Yeah, but really, are you all right?

05:37.520 --> 05:37.760
No.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.520
I mean, we were like wicked prepared.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.880
Like, let me say this.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.560
It sucks.

05:43.200 --> 05:47.040
Like, cause it's like, it's weird because you don't really think about the closest

05:47.040 --> 05:48.320
comparisons like Christmas.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.680
It's like, well, I better, I hope you have everything cause you can't get nothing.

05:51.680 --> 05:56.480
Like, it's like that, but could last for days cause I can't get nothing.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.880
You can't get, you literally can't get anything.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.080
Can't get anything.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.640
I, uh, yeah, I can't get anything.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.440
I made a run.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.480
This was scary.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.240
I almost didn't have Ramchata.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.040
Ooh.

06:07.040 --> 06:07.440
All right.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.240
Let's start the show.

06:08.240 --> 06:12.400
This is, this is your, your privilege has been showing for the past seven minutes and

06:12.400 --> 06:13.360
it's making me sick.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.920
Uh, put your privilege away.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.280
I was kidding about the Ramchata, but I also did not have Brandy.

06:19.280 --> 06:23.520
So it was like a winter storm without the kvassia.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.560
I would rather not.

06:24.560 --> 06:24.960
Thank you.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.760
Um, where do you, hey, can I ask you a question?

06:27.760 --> 06:28.800
Where do you winter storm?

06:29.360 --> 06:29.760
Oh, me?

06:30.560 --> 06:31.920
I go to Justin's lodge.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.040
We have Ramchata and Brandy drinks mixed together.

06:35.040 --> 06:40.160
We listen to soft sounds and we just try to lower our heart rate down to just a barely

06:40.160 --> 06:41.280
alive level.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.880
It's really the only way to do it.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.840
It's the, it's the only way to winter storm.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.800
I keep looking outside thinking that it would have slowed or perhaps slacked or perhaps

06:50.800 --> 06:52.880
stopped in any way.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.120
Nah.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.080
It is still going like full tilt boogie the same as it was.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.360
This is so weird because we're recording this in the past when people are listening

06:59.360 --> 06:59.920
to it.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.240
Like people could be listening to this long after we've lost contact with Justin.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.800
This could be my last like transmission.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.120
This could be like your Martian still haven't seen it.

07:09.120 --> 07:09.760
Please, please listen.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.560
This is crucial.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.920
I have a baby.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.360
If this is my last transmission, this is so important.

07:15.360 --> 07:21.360
Please bring a portable television and hold up ASMR videos to my office window and just

07:21.360 --> 07:22.720
smash it with a brick.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.720
I just have to hear those soft singles.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.920
Um, I will say if this is your last episode, that's really too bad because we've spent

07:29.920 --> 07:33.600
the last eight minutes of the show's 60 minute runtime talking about the weather.

07:34.400 --> 07:39.600
Yeah, but the good news is no one will think of it as the one where they talk about ASMR.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.040
That'll be the last one.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.480
Last one in the series of like 40.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.360
When we finally hit on that hilarious weather chat.

07:47.360 --> 07:47.920
Let's do it.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.120
Let's do it.

07:49.120 --> 07:54.400
My wife's dad, two brothers and brother-in-law all go on a yearly grouper fishing trip.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.680
How do you fish?

07:55.680 --> 07:56.080
Yeah.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.600
How do you like designate?

07:57.600 --> 07:59.200
Like, all right, only the grouper.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.960
Come on up and bite.

08:00.960 --> 08:01.680
Bite this shit.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.440
Maybe they just go to like a grouper farm.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.720
Get the fuck out of here, Cod.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.080
It's grouper time, groupers.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.000
It's time for the reckoning.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.800
You know what's up.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.640
Well, I would.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.840
Come on up here.

08:11.840 --> 08:17.280
I mean, I would imagine that you, it would be based on your bait, right?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.240
You use like grouper dogs.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.240
The favorite grouper snacks.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.000
The favorite grouper crisps.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.960
Oh, that's my favorite.

08:24.960 --> 08:31.280
If you're doing, if you're doing like grouper trolling out Miami, it's a pretty easy tactic

08:31.280 --> 08:34.800
to catch decent sized gag groupers on a shallow patch reef.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.720
Just get a standard 50 pound trolling outfit.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.600
That'll do the job.

08:37.600 --> 08:42.160
Yeah, you unfurl a waterproof grouper pornographic magazine.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.640
Took me a couple of runs at that one.

08:44.640 --> 08:49.520
Just make sure you use a strong shock leader of approximately 25 feet connected by crimps

08:49.520 --> 08:50.480
to a hundred pounds.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.280
Salmon pornography will work too.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.120
Groupers are really down to clown with just anything.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.320
They're very open minded fish.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.120
They're pretty dirty.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.200
Anyway, we're on a grouper fishing trip.

09:00.160 --> 09:00.480
Right now.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.240
They're all pretty strong fishermen.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.040
No, wait.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.320
They're all pretty strong men.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.720
I've gone the past two years.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.800
The first year I wasn't able to pull up a fish.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.320
Yeah, she's a heavy fish, the grouper.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.480
Second year I got seasick.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.360
The second year I got seasick.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.920
Should I bow out of all future trips?

09:17.920 --> 09:20.160
Should I keep going for the camaraderie?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.360
They give me a hard time about it, but will probably still make fun of me for not going.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.560
Frustrated fishing failure.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.880
You have to go.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.840
You have to go.

09:30.560 --> 09:36.160
But like one of these years, can you please show up and just be diesel?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.040
Like what better?

09:37.680 --> 09:41.440
What would be better than to be like, anybody, any of you need help lifting fish?

09:42.640 --> 09:44.240
Oh God, what happened to Dave?

09:44.240 --> 09:45.280
I'm worried about him.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.880
I got fish lifters, baby.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.040
Oh my God, have you seen Dave lately?

09:53.040 --> 09:55.920
Look at his just glistening fish lifters.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.880
His shirt is big enough for my chest, but not my fish lifters.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.400
Has he been dead lifting fish?

10:02.400 --> 10:07.040
I wouldn't mind having those fish lifters wrapped all around me in the cold.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.760
They're only for fish, Victoria.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.800
I lift fish and I lift spirits.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.760
I lift fish and I lift that nationwide morale.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.440
Victoria, would you mind opening the door for me?

10:18.240 --> 10:21.280
I'm holding two bags of groceries and both your hands are free.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.680
Victoria, you know the arrangement.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.200
These are fish lifters.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.640
I have to impress your brothers.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.000
I can't use these for anything other than lifting fish.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.960
I want a divorce, Dave.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.400
Can I still go on the fishing trip?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.400
Please don't take this away from me.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.960
Having big, sick fish lifters is going to be a very good move,

10:40.960 --> 10:42.800
and you can use that for a lot of things.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.880
And I feel like that's another catch-all for us.

10:45.440 --> 10:50.080
Just get extremely physically attractive or get extremely, extremely powerful,

10:50.080 --> 10:52.080
like really very powerful fish diesel.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.080
He's my favorite actor.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.720
One sweet thing would be to act like you have huge fish lifters

10:58.720 --> 11:00.720
and then act like you can't lift the fish.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.800
Like say, oh, it's too heavy.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.120
Oh yeah, put a dramatic arc into your hang.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.680
Oh, and then it's a really tiny fish and everybody gets a good laugh.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.560
A lot of bad stuff happens.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.960
I was just going to say, you could tear it in half.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.360
Just tear it in half while they watch and then lift.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.560
You're like, that's better.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.000
That's much easier.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.640
He did it.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.760
He's the chosen one.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.440
Can you get, can you get?

11:21.440 --> 11:22.960
Ah, see, I was going to propose a plan

11:22.960 --> 11:24.800
and then I realized my own fatal flaw in the plan.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.840
I'll propose the plan first.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.760
Then I'll explain what the fatal flaw is.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.560
The proposed plan that I wanted to put forward

11:30.560 --> 11:32.800
is you have Dwayne the Rock Johnson in a scuba suit

11:32.800 --> 11:35.040
underneath the boat, just holding on for dear life.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.720
And then when you catch the fish and reel it up,

11:36.720 --> 11:38.400
he lifts it into the boat for you.

11:39.040 --> 11:39.760
But then he hides it.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.440
Maybe he's wearing a ghillie suit.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.120
The fatal flaw in that is there is no way

11:43.120 --> 11:45.520
you're going to keep the Rock from just unhinging his jaw

11:45.520 --> 11:46.480
and eating that fish hole.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.360
Cause he eats like fucking 12 pounds of cod every single day.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.200
If he sees because he hates cod,

11:51.200 --> 11:52.160
not because he's hungry.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.760
Well, he loves, he loves getting boss fish lifters too.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.080
He needs to maintain them.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.640
That's why Lady Gaga wouldn't wear her meat dress around him.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.320
Who would just like, oh, pop it.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.600
No red meat, no red meat.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.360
Just that good cod.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.680
Just that good cod?

12:07.680 --> 12:07.920
Yeah.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.320
What if, say he's unable to get those,

12:10.320 --> 12:11.440
like for medical reasons,

12:11.440 --> 12:13.440
he can't get diesel fish lifters.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.840
I would say the alternate ending of this movie,

12:15.840 --> 12:18.240
but isn't the ending of this movie always like,

12:18.240 --> 12:19.120
you can't do it.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.000
But then they get into some kind of scrape

12:22.000 --> 12:24.320
and like they're unable to do something that like,

12:24.320 --> 12:26.640
oh, Skinny Todd can fix the engine

12:26.640 --> 12:28.480
cause he can slide through the ducks.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.160
Like maybe like you can't, you can't lift the fish,

12:32.160 --> 12:34.960
but then one of them needs help setting up a tumbler.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.200
Yeah.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.360
And you're like, here, no problem, allow me.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.920
But let me help you post the pictures of your fish.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.880
Click, click, click, click, click.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.080
Skinny Todd, you did it.

12:44.080 --> 12:44.720
But this movie-

12:44.720 --> 12:45.920
Get back in the engine.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.480
You realize-

12:46.480 --> 12:48.480
Get back in the engine, Skinny Todd.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.560
You realize this movie's gonna end

12:50.560 --> 12:52.560
with Skinny Todd falling into the water

12:52.560 --> 12:53.840
and everybody gets really worried,

12:53.840 --> 12:56.400
but then he magically transforms into a fish.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.480
The Skinny Todd Limpet.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.480
And then they all learned to love fish

13:00.480 --> 13:01.040
and they stop the fishing.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.160
And miss Todd.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.440
And they miss Todd very much.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.040
Everybody misses Todd.

13:05.040 --> 13:05.360
Very much.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.280
He's a fish now.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.520
He can't talk or think or anything.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.320
He's a fucking fish.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.040
He's a fish.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.880
And then they catch him, but then they let him go

13:12.880 --> 13:13.920
and it's very touching.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.560
And they let him go.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.680
And as they throw Todd back, fish Todd,

13:17.680 --> 13:19.760
back into the water as he's flying through the air,

13:19.760 --> 13:20.240
who's that?

13:20.240 --> 13:23.200
Pops out of the water like fucking Jason

13:23.200 --> 13:24.160
on hinges his jocks.

13:24.160 --> 13:24.880
The Rockies.

13:24.880 --> 13:25.760
Todd Hull.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.480
And it's a horror.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.760
It was a horror movie the whole time.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.480
Do you guys want a yahoo?

13:30.480 --> 13:30.720
Yes, please.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.520
Yeah, for sure.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.280
Or did you want me to read this summary

13:33.280 --> 13:34.960
of The Incredible Mr. Limpet?

13:34.960 --> 13:35.280
Nah.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.240
It's fucking crazy.

13:36.240 --> 13:36.400
No, we did that-

13:36.400 --> 13:37.680
What if people don't know?

13:37.680 --> 13:39.440
Literally less than 10 episodes ago.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.760
But what if they don't know, Griffin?

13:41.760 --> 13:42.400
This one was sent in by-

13:42.400 --> 13:43.440
Yeah, what if they miss that one?

13:43.440 --> 13:45.920
This one was sent in by Dan Boduin.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.360
And just based on how poorly I pronounce that,

13:51.360 --> 13:53.920
it's not Bodin-well that I said it right.

13:55.120 --> 13:55.680
Nice.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.080
And it's by yahoo answers user Nutty.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.240
I didn't really know how to pronounce that.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.240
It's like Nutty, but there's extra T's and I's.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.560
Anyway, Nutty asks,

14:05.760 --> 14:08.160
extremely short tongue for kissing.

14:09.120 --> 14:09.600
Wait.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.280
I have very short tongue.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.720
Let's say I'm sticking out my tongue straightly,

14:16.720 --> 14:20.080
and its length is not even half an inch from the teeth

14:20.080 --> 14:21.920
to the end of the tongue.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.480
Jesus.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.000
It's extremely short tongue.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.120
They said it in the fucking title.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.080
Why are you surprised?

14:28.080 --> 14:31.440
But that just seems like he lost some in an accident.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.120
It's like that's not even half an inch from the teeth

14:33.120 --> 14:33.840
to the end of the tongue.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.440
I am so serious about this.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.240
And it makes me so sad whenever my girlfriend and I make out.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.080
She does most of jobs,

14:40.080 --> 14:43.520
and it is so hard for me to do my moves, you know.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.640
Please need advice on technique, lol.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.440
Help, lol.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.000
It's probably-

14:48.000 --> 14:51.200
This dear heart, it's probably hard for them to say lol.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.960
Yeah, I was gonna say, like,

14:52.960 --> 14:56.400
your girlfriend's upset about you not being able to do your kiss moves,

14:56.400 --> 14:59.040
but she's fine with the fact that you, like, can't say T.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.600
Like, you can't say any T's or most letters.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.600
What if he really just has a really deep mouth?

15:06.320 --> 15:07.360
That is another-

15:07.360 --> 15:12.000
His tongue is perfectly normal length, but inside it is cavernous.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.600
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.360
I have a lot of inner tongue,

15:15.360 --> 15:17.920
and if you want to meet it, you're gonna need to go to the dentist.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.200
You're gonna have to come to me.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.720
Maybe his face looks like Alec Baldwin's in Beetlejuice,

15:23.520 --> 15:25.680
when they do the stretch out beaky face.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.240
All right.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.760
Follow me here.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.120
Stretch out beaky face.

15:29.120 --> 15:29.680
All right.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.040
All right.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.800
Which would make it hard to do some kiss moves,

15:34.800 --> 15:36.880
because your eyeballs are in there, if I remember correctly.

15:36.880 --> 15:37.280
Sure.

15:37.280 --> 15:41.760
See, what I like better is less you have an elongated beak-like mouth,

15:41.760 --> 15:44.720
and more that you just have a regular head and mouth and everything,

15:44.720 --> 15:46.880
but your tongue starts really far back.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.400
Like way wicked back.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.760
Like mid esophagus.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.600
Yeah, like super duper back.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.200
Here's like a pretty good question that nobody really wants to address.

15:55.200 --> 15:55.520
Yeah.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.680
You know the tip of your tongue, right?

15:57.680 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.240
What is the other end?

16:00.240 --> 16:02.240
Lots of people know the tip of my tongue, if you know what I'm saying.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.520
Yeah, sweet.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.960
Like in a job interview setting?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.360
What's the other end connected to?

16:08.720 --> 16:09.600
Your feet.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.640
No, I mean like it runs all the way down.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.400
Like envision your tongue, right?

16:14.400 --> 16:18.080
Like it's going, imagine you're going on a ride down the back of your throat, right?

16:18.080 --> 16:19.280
You're on your tongue.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.680
Oh God, oh fuck, oh God.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.040
Slow the fuck down, Justin.

16:24.880 --> 16:29.120
You get past the uvula, and then you're just like, what?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.120
What's going on at the back of your tongue?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, where's the start?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.480
What if it's not connected, but if you think about it too hard,

16:34.480 --> 16:35.680
your tongue falls out.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.120
He just choked to death right there.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.560
Right there in your tongue.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.280
Oh fuck, this is the most excited this podcast has ever made me.

16:41.920 --> 16:42.960
Oh great.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.440
Oh no.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.520
Uh, here's another question.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.840
I received a Bob Ross painting kit.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.240
Wait, you just get, you're giving up on short tongue?

16:50.240 --> 16:51.920
We were afraid of your erection.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.840
I feel like, yeah, actually, Travis, thank you for putting a point on it.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.960
That's exactly what happened.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.200
We don't do enough questions on this show anymore.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.080
My whole thing for 2016 is like, let's do more questions.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.120
Okay, well that's fine.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.880
It's just like the happiest of questions made me in a long time,

17:04.880 --> 17:07.280
but let's just blow, kind of lean over it.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.040
Listen to this part at 1.5 speed.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.440
That was a premium swallow, though.

17:16.080 --> 17:18.000
I received a Bob Ross painting kit for Christmas,

17:18.000 --> 17:19.120
and I've done some paintings.

17:19.120 --> 17:22.960
I would love, by the way, if you're looking for a considerate gift to get me,

17:22.960 --> 17:24.080
P.O. Box 54.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.280
Bob Ross painting kit, as long as it comes with all the required accoutrement.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.960
What a tasteful-

17:30.960 --> 17:31.600
Paint by numbers?

17:32.240 --> 17:32.960
I guess, yes.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.880
Or just like an instructional video.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.080
I like them, and I want to hang them, but is that a little arrogant?

17:38.080 --> 17:45.440
What is acceptable to hang your own mediocre paintings?

17:45.440 --> 17:48.240
That's from Artistically Acute in Arkansas.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.280
If you do this, you have to have permanently attached to your hand

17:51.280 --> 17:56.080
a glass filled with red wine all the time so you can gesture to your art.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.800
Yeah, that shit, that shit was me.

17:58.800 --> 18:02.240
What you're seeing right there is how I see the world beautifully.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.600
That's my mountain.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.960
That's my mountain.

18:04.960 --> 18:05.760
I made it.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.920
That is my mountain wife.

18:07.920 --> 18:13.120
I took all of my experiences throughout my life and the emotions I was feeling that day,

18:13.120 --> 18:15.040
and I committed them to canvas.

18:15.600 --> 18:23.120
I don't know, like, it kind of depends on how the painting was brought, right?

18:23.120 --> 18:26.240
Like if you follow along the video, I think that's fine.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.240
If you were filling in the parts that he told you to fill,

18:30.240 --> 18:33.440
like if it was like Travis said, a paint by numbers or what have you,

18:33.440 --> 18:35.680
like that gets a little dicier for me.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.040
I feel like that is not something you necessarily need to display.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.960
Unless you pitch it as a, oh, this one?

18:40.960 --> 18:43.040
This is a me and Bob collab-o.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.680
I collaborated on this artistic-

18:45.680 --> 18:47.920
That's a Bob Steve original.

18:47.920 --> 18:48.240
Yeah.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.840
Oh, we'll see you eyeballing my art.

18:52.400 --> 18:57.120
He told me to use periwinkle here, and I went with azure.

18:58.160 --> 18:58.800
Went with what?

18:59.600 --> 19:00.240
Azure.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.240
All right.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.040
You added like three syllables.

19:03.040 --> 19:03.840
The color, the color azure?

19:03.840 --> 19:06.720
Yeah, I think it's azure, not azure.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.480
Azure, I think, is the color.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.080
I'm like 900% sure you'd be in a ding-dong right now.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.760
I believe it's azuree.

19:13.760 --> 19:14.880
I think it's azure.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.800
Does your opinion change on this question,

19:19.520 --> 19:23.120
depending on the quality of the finished product?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.280
Azure, azure.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.960
Yeah, that's right, motherfucker.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.960
Azure, azure.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.080
Okay, so just to be clear, in case you've been listening for a long time,

19:32.080 --> 19:34.880
Griffin is now siding with a robot over his breath.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.680
Okay, come on.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.800
The robot's siding with me, if anything.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.560
Azure, azure, azure.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.000
Now make it say dirty words.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.480
Hey, can you make it say, like, make it say butthole?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.040
I don't think, I don't think-

19:49.040 --> 19:50.160
Make it say butthole.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.760
Justin, make it say butthole.

19:51.760 --> 19:57.200
Butthole, butthole.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.320
Yay!

19:58.320 --> 19:59.680
Are you doing it as two different words?

19:59.680 --> 20:02.240
Yeah, it doesn't have butthole together.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.040
Hey, check this out.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.440
That's pretty good.

20:06.080 --> 20:06.560
I found one.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.040
I found one.

20:07.040 --> 20:07.440
Can I try?

20:08.000 --> 20:08.240
Yeah.

20:09.360 --> 20:09.860
Butthole.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.840
That's how they think butthole does.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.320
Butthole.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.120
Any more?

20:15.120 --> 20:15.920
Penis.

20:15.920 --> 20:16.240
Fuck.

20:16.880 --> 20:21.920
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.200
This is top notch.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.560
This is good jokes right here.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.440
This is gonna be our first charged for episode.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.440
For pay.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.960
Griffin's gonna be editing this and he's gonna be like, it's 30 minutes long.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.840
I had to cut the 20 minutes where they let robots say words.

20:35.840 --> 20:36.720
What was I thinking?

20:37.520 --> 20:38.720
Why did I encourage that?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.800
Hey, listen, I got one coming in hot.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.520
Hold on.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.080
Premium.

20:43.040 --> 20:43.540
Fuck.

20:44.240 --> 20:44.960
Boy.

20:44.960 --> 20:45.460
Yay!

20:48.160 --> 20:52.560
I asked, I actually asked it to say Justin McElroy and that's what it came out with.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.200
That's weird.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.720
I hope that this is a lot of people's first episodes.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.000
Wait, hold on, wait, here's one.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.240
Hello, my name is Derek and I am a premium fuck boy.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.960
Hello, Derek.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.880
Would anyone like some penis tricks?

21:11.680 --> 21:12.240
Some what?

21:14.240 --> 21:15.360
Would anyone like some what?

21:15.360 --> 21:16.320
Penis tricks.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.120
What are those?

21:17.760 --> 21:19.600
Tricks you do with your dinger.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.200
Oh, let's get back on the fucking saddle.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.080
What were we even doing or talking about?

21:24.080 --> 21:25.040
Bob Ross.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.000
I think it's a bad taste.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.040
I don't think you can do it.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.320
I don't make fucking episodes of this podcast my ringtone.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.280
You know what I mean?

21:33.280 --> 21:34.000
Oh, I do.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.040
I play on my podcast for people and I watch them enjoy it.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.640
And then I shush them if they try to talk during it.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.760
Then where do you land on the mounting your own paintings?

21:43.760 --> 21:47.600
I think you have to do it, but in a special room that you invite people and they're like,

21:47.600 --> 21:48.640
oh, are you having a good time?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.400
Thank you for joining me in my home this evening.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.520
Can I show you what I'm really proud of?

21:53.520 --> 21:57.760
And then you throw open the door and it's floor to ceiling your own Bob Rossian paintings.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.600
And you refer to them as your children.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.880
I want to ask you a question, Travis.

22:02.880 --> 22:03.520
Yes?

22:03.520 --> 22:06.320
Because I know you're not joking about making people listen to your podcast.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.960
Especially like really funny parts.

22:08.960 --> 22:13.760
And I have done the same thing with people who like ask you like, what's a podcast or

22:13.760 --> 22:14.960
what's your show like?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.080
So here's my question to you.

22:16.080 --> 22:21.760
When you're forcing someone to listen to a podcast you made, what do you think the

22:21.760 --> 22:25.200
appropriate thing is to do with your eyes?

22:25.200 --> 22:27.360
Both your eyes and their eyes.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.440
Where should everybody be looking for the four minutes that you are listening to your

22:31.440 --> 22:32.240
own podcast?

22:32.240 --> 22:35.600
Because I'll be damned if I can come like you're not looking at the screen.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.880
There's nothing there.

22:36.880 --> 22:40.880
So do you keep eye contact with the person and just sort of like nod slowly?

22:40.880 --> 22:44.560
My go to is to look off in the middle distance.

22:44.560 --> 22:50.560
But kind of like squint a little bit like I'm trying to remember a childhood friend's

22:50.560 --> 22:51.040
name.

22:51.040 --> 22:55.840
Like you're watching a movie based on the things that you're saying somewhere in another

22:55.840 --> 22:56.640
room.

22:56.640 --> 23:02.560
It's like I'm waiting for like some kind of clue or to drop where they'll be like,

23:02.560 --> 23:03.600
oh, yeah.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:04.960 --> 23:05.920
I love this.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.880
That's what I'm waiting for anybody I'm with to see.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.160
I'm waiting for them to say that.

23:10.160 --> 23:15.840
I think it is bogus that you're trying to justify making other people listen to your

23:15.840 --> 23:22.240
show with you in the room based on like informational its informational value when like if you're

23:22.240 --> 23:26.160
a chef and you're like, oh, I make pie for a living and somebody's like, I don't know

23:26.160 --> 23:26.720
what's a pie.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.440
I don't know what pie is.

23:27.440 --> 23:31.280
You don't have to be like, well, I guess I have to cook a pie now because I'm a genie

23:31.280 --> 23:32.960
and you said my code word.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.640
Would there be a human being alive, Griffin, that if you sat them down and said, watch

23:36.640 --> 23:42.080
me, I'm a professional pie maker, watch me make this pie for you, that they'd be like,

23:42.080 --> 23:43.360
oh, God, I hate those.

23:43.360 --> 23:46.080
Well, no, because pies add something to society.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.320
While podcasts, I would say, if anything, detract.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.200
Detract, yeah.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.360
It's also helpful sometimes like if you're getting near a really funny part and you know

23:53.360 --> 23:55.680
you're about to say a super funny joke.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.160
Oh, here it comes.

23:56.160 --> 23:56.880
Oh, and they talk.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.400
You just stare at the person and if they start to say something like, no, just listen, listen,

24:00.400 --> 24:01.200
listen.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.080
Oh, let me run it back.

24:02.080 --> 24:02.560
You missed.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.200
OK, hold on.

24:03.200 --> 24:09.040
What's weird, Travis, is that you, in real life, because right now this is the digi world,

24:09.040 --> 24:12.560
now that people are downloading and listening to this, they are in this podcast, Us Talking

24:12.560 --> 24:13.760
is now in the digi world.

24:13.760 --> 24:18.160
In real life, you just did this to one of your friends with that text-to-speech part

24:18.160 --> 24:18.880
that just happened.

24:18.880 --> 24:19.360
And you're like, oh, fuck, fuck.

24:19.360 --> 24:23.200
And when you said one of my friends, you mean my wife, which is the only person that will

24:23.200 --> 24:24.080
hang out with me anymore.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.880
Yo, T-Bird, this shit is about to get sick.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.120
They make a robot talk about penis tricks.

24:29.120 --> 24:29.920
You're going to love it.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.960
Please don't interrupt.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.120
Please, please keep it down.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.320
I know you've had a cough, oddly, if you could try and curtail it just a little bit while

24:36.320 --> 24:38.560
the robot says penis tricks.

24:38.560 --> 24:43.200
It's also important to note, if the person talks, you pause it and sigh heavily and then

24:43.200 --> 24:45.200
turn to them and say, I'm sorry, what?

24:46.240 --> 24:46.880
What was it?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.560
This is my art, but I guess that's...

24:50.000 --> 24:54.560
I just thought about hanging a painting that I made up and it made...

24:54.560 --> 24:56.080
Well, OK, here's the thing, actually.

24:56.080 --> 25:01.840
There's this website called Canvas On Demand, and they do these insane canvas print deals

25:01.840 --> 25:05.040
all the time for photos, and Rachel and I have done it.

25:05.040 --> 25:11.120
I think we have three of these nice canvas things that are based on pictures that I've

25:11.120 --> 25:15.600
taken, like some from our honeymoon in Japan and one from our trip to Hong Kong, and we

25:15.600 --> 25:17.520
actually do have those hanging up in the house.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.560
Same principle?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.400
Sounds pretty boring to me.

25:20.400 --> 25:20.880
OK.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.720
I'm sorry, Julie.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.320
I don't know why she said that.

25:24.320 --> 25:28.480
Honest advice time, you can do it, but you just can't be...

25:28.480 --> 25:30.320
Because you can be proud of a thing you make.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.040
There's nothing wrong with that.

25:31.040 --> 25:31.840
Well, I don't fucking...

25:31.840 --> 25:35.200
When people come into the house, I'm not just standing by my canvas.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.840
What if the photo is a tasteful nude?

25:37.840 --> 25:38.640
Like myself?

25:38.640 --> 25:39.200
Uh-huh.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.200
Or someone else?

25:41.200 --> 25:43.040
No, like yourself and you hang it like over the back of your chair.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.000
Justin, you've been quiet for a while.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.040
Are you making that robot say shit?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.680
No, I am not.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.880
I was thinking about whether or not I would have the guts to display a painting of my

25:50.880 --> 25:51.520
own.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.000
Yeah.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.560
Well, can you do me a favor and as you're thinking about it, just save your feelings

25:56.560 --> 25:57.520
like as you're thinking them?

25:58.400 --> 26:02.560
I think art and craft are really two separate things, aren't they?

26:03.600 --> 26:04.400
Damn, that's good.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.240
Well, this is what happens if we let Justin be quiet for a couple of minutes.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.400
He thinks up some really dope shit to say.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.840
Like, think about that for a second.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.080
There's a difference between art and craft, and I don't think...

26:14.080 --> 26:17.920
I think that by displaying art, you're saying...

26:17.920 --> 26:19.520
You're making a statement.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.400
You're making a statement by displaying craft.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.120
You're bragging.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.120
And that's where it separates from me.

26:25.120 --> 26:30.640
It's like when you make a piece of art that comes from some creative place in your soul

26:30.640 --> 26:33.440
and then you put it on display, you're saying like, this is an important thought to me.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.800
This is an important concept.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.240
What's the delineation there for painting?

26:36.240 --> 26:37.760
Because then you could actually get...

26:37.760 --> 26:38.720
Because you're not...

26:38.720 --> 26:43.920
If you're doing something that Bob Ross told you to do, I don't classify that as a work

26:43.920 --> 26:47.280
of art because it's about the craft of how you reenact it.

26:47.280 --> 26:50.480
Now, if you... What if Bob Ross did something that you told him to do?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.720
Is this a genuine Bob Ross?

26:54.720 --> 26:55.440
Yeah, it's a...

26:55.440 --> 26:56.400
You like that shit?

26:56.400 --> 26:59.440
I was like, yo, Bob, my boy, do a snowy caldera.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.200
And he was like, you got it, and he did it.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.000
And he was like, hey, man, I just put paint to canvas.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.840
You're the fucking mind behind this thing.

27:05.840 --> 27:06.960
That would be a collabo.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.000
That's a really good point, actually.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.280
That's a sick collabo.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.480
See, that's what we need to do.

27:10.480 --> 27:15.680
We need to start up a fucking art studio for people who cannot paint.

27:15.680 --> 27:20.560
But we will have painters come in and do just contract work.

27:20.560 --> 27:28.800
Just do me up one of Homer Simpson, but he's pissing on the Ford logo.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.960
And this really good artist is like, you got it.

27:30.960 --> 27:35.040
And then they craft this painting to your specifications, but it's your art.

27:35.040 --> 27:35.760
It's your art.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.520
You did the art.

27:37.520 --> 27:38.880
And then you put your name on it.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.200
Yeah.

27:39.200 --> 27:43.600
The greatest tragedy in the world is that Bob Ross died before I could make him paint

27:43.600 --> 27:46.000
Bart Simpson peeing on a Ford logo.

27:46.000 --> 27:46.640
Homer Simpson.

27:47.200 --> 27:47.680
Calvin.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.880
Well, it's Bart Simpson peeing on Homer Simpson who's peeing on Calvin who's peeing on the

27:52.880 --> 27:54.160
Ford logo all the way down.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.080
It's like a fountain.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.440
Hey, guys, listen.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.960
We've talked for long enough.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.960
Let's go to the Money's Own New Choice Bits of Beefsteak.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.760
Okay.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.200
That's my assistant, Richard.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.000
You need to have an HR discussion with her.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.400
I feel very uncomfortable in the workplace.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.160
Yeah, it seems really-

28:14.160 --> 28:16.080
I'm sorry, were you podcasting?

28:16.080 --> 28:18.800
Yes, Bridget, I told you I was.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.240
Please get out of my office.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.280
Hey there, Bridget.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.280
What a smooth and sexy voice you have.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.560
Bridget, baby, are you still there?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.200
Talk to me, stud rocket.

28:34.080 --> 28:34.640
ASL.

28:39.920 --> 28:40.640
Should I leave?

28:40.640 --> 28:41.140
Yes.

28:46.080 --> 28:48.000
It's about to get strange.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.200
All right, let's go to the Money's Own.

28:50.000 --> 28:50.320
No.

28:50.320 --> 28:50.820
Okay.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.160
I'm almost finished.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.120
He's become sentient.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.400
I'm almost finished.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.600
I'm almost finished.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.880
I'm almost finished.

28:58.880 --> 28:59.840
I'm almost finished.

29:02.000 --> 29:02.560
Here we go.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.720
Oh, oh, oh.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.800
Oh, damn.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.200
I done flooded my basement.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.520
I done flooded my basement?

29:17.520 --> 29:18.160
What?

29:18.160 --> 29:19.120
I had an O.

29:19.120 --> 29:39.920

I used Squarespace to start up my Shrek porn site.

30:14.800 --> 30:19.920
Man, I really don't understand computers.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.200
I don't either.

You're welcome.

30:44.720 --> 30:45.600
I appreciate it.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.680
Let me tell you about Bowling Branch.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.520
Use your human, use your meat voice.

30:50.160 --> 30:54.320
I have been, it is a luxurious place for bedding.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.920
Well, it's a place for luxurious bedding.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.680
I don't know if it's probably a warehouse.

30:57.680 --> 31:02.320
You mean bedding like mad, like sleep bedding, not like bedding on the ponies.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.160
Yeah, bet on the luxurious ponies.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.960
Bowling Branch, the sleeping ponies.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.040
Now there, it's the sheets are fantastic.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.120
I mean, like, I don't know what else to say other than I was,

31:11.120 --> 31:15.840
I've like bought lots of sheets trying to find something that feels like they do

31:15.840 --> 31:18.400
when you get into them at a hotel and they're all cool and smooth.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.200
And Bowling Branch like does it and it's fantastic.

31:22.080 --> 31:26.640
And they're, they're luxurious sheets for a couple hundred bucks.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.920
Like we've been sleeping on our Bowling Branch sheets for the last couple of weeks.

31:29.920 --> 31:30.880
They're great, right?

31:30.880 --> 31:33.200
It's, they just keep getting more comfortable.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.000
Like it's like breaking in a great pair of shoes.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.320
And you know what they do is they get quality, quality cotton.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.800
They don't worry about thread count because thread count is a myth.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.680
That's not a thing.

31:43.680 --> 31:47.200
It doesn't actually affect how soft and comfortable the sheets are.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.720
That's the quality of the cotton and they get really, really good cotton.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.280
And they don't just have sheets, they got towels, they've got blankets,

31:53.280 --> 31:57.360
they've got duvet covers, everything you need to live a comfortable life.

31:57.360 --> 32:02.720

It's sick.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.640
I got a message for Mitch.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.600
This one's from David.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.560
If you want to get a message on the show, just go to maximumfun.org.jumbotron.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.360
It's really easy.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.120
This message is for Mitch though.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.560
And it's from David.

32:20.560 --> 32:24.320
David says, dear Mitch, happy late, late, late birthday.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.240
Thank you for being there and putting up with me.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.600
You're the best girlfriend ever.

32:27.600 --> 32:32.720
And although, and it says I have to read this in my wizard swear's voice from episode 251.

32:32.720 --> 32:35.440
This ladder goes in six directions.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.640
It always ends up pointing at your heart.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.480
All my love, Dave's.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.360
Perfect.

32:41.360 --> 32:41.920
Griffin?

32:41.920 --> 32:43.360
I don't remember if I did that right or not.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.720
No, I think you nailed it.

32:44.720 --> 32:45.760
You nailed it.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.880
Can I read this next one?

32:46.880 --> 32:47.360
Yeah, sure.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.880
Yeah, because I love it.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.880
This message is for Ryan Brent.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.880
And his message is from Ed Bury.

32:55.680 --> 33:02.160
And Ed Bury says anything that includes happy birthday and for real, real, not for play, play.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.680
So a lot of like lenience there.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.280
Yeah, whatever you guys want to do.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.120
Listen, I'm not the creative one here.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.520
Ed Bury understands that he doesn't have a podcast.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.280
He's not the one people are tuning in.

33:15.280 --> 33:19.200
He wants us to do a little bit of that voodoo that we do.

33:19.200 --> 33:23.040
So I could do a whole fucking diatribe about how when I was a little kid,

33:23.040 --> 33:26.400
I thought that the lady dragon from Shrek was really sexy.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.360
But then it's somewhere in there.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.240
As long as they say happy birthday for real, real, not for play, play,

33:30.240 --> 33:33.280
then it would have satisfied this person's demands,

33:33.280 --> 33:37.760
much like that lady dragon satisfied my confused teenage demands.

33:39.760 --> 33:44.960
I enjoy the conceit that like your attraction to the lady dragon from Shrek is like

33:44.960 --> 33:47.360
something we wouldn't normally hit on the show.

33:48.560 --> 33:52.800
My Brother, My Brother and Me is really a forum for a discussion like that.

33:52.800 --> 33:53.920
Not for those sorts of ideas.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.880
Thankfully, Ed Bury opened that door and said,

33:56.880 --> 34:01.040
Griffin, the next five minutes is all yours off the clock, free of charge.

34:01.040 --> 34:06.080
I've been waiting for a fucking wild card opportunity like this for years,

34:06.080 --> 34:07.840
and you guys have just never left the door open.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.680
Yes, the scales are nice.

34:10.800 --> 34:14.480
Thank you to Mitch and David for giving us a little bit more boundaries

34:14.480 --> 34:17.200
so I don't have to hear about Griffin's.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.840
Oh, this is a mistake that nobody else is ever going to make.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.560
Yeah, you've made the mistake here.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.640
Now we all have to live in this mess.

34:24.640 --> 34:29.360
It's she's just very big and I think could swallow me probably pretty easily.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.000
Hi, I'm Sydney McElroy.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.280
And I'm Riley Smyrl.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.000
And we co-host a podcast called Still Buffering,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.480
a sister's guide to teens through the 80s.

34:38.480 --> 34:43.920
On our show, we tackle all of the hot teen topics that kids have on their minds today.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.680
Hot teen topics?

34:45.680 --> 34:49.760
Well, you know, the questions that are that are plaguing teenagers

34:49.760 --> 34:52.480
through their tumultuous growing years.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.880
Questions like, how do I party?

34:54.880 --> 34:57.760
Or what do I do with all this hair everywhere?

34:57.760 --> 35:02.480
The same questions that people like Sydney had during their years as teenagers.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.720
Many, many, many.

35:04.720 --> 35:05.680
Okay, not that many.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.520
So, so long ago.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.120
Yeah, okay, I think they get the idea.

35:09.120 --> 35:13.280
So search for Still Buffering on iTunes or MaximumFun.org

35:13.280 --> 35:15.440
for new episodes every Tuesday.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.480
Still Buffering.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.600
I am a teenager.

35:17.600 --> 35:24.640
And I was too.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.120
Do you guys want a yahoo?

35:25.120 --> 35:26.000
Hard drive's filling up.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.200
So we need another yahoo.

35:27.200 --> 35:31.600
Yeah, this yahoo was sent in by Morgan Davey.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.240
Thank you, Morgan.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.880
It's by an anonymous yahoo user.

35:34.880 --> 35:36.240
Ooh.

35:36.240 --> 35:36.560
Okay.

35:38.880 --> 35:39.600
Who could it be?

35:39.600 --> 35:40.960
Could it be the president?

35:40.960 --> 35:43.360
Could it be, I don't know, somebody else?

35:44.160 --> 35:45.600
I ran out of people after the president.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.720
Quick update, snow is still falling at just an alarming rate.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.920
Just really bad.

35:49.920 --> 35:50.480
Really bad.

35:51.920 --> 35:55.840
This anonymous user, let's call him, let's just call him who they are.

35:57.440 --> 35:57.840
Craig.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.320
T. Nelson from Coach.

36:00.320 --> 36:00.880
T. Nelson.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.000
Sorry that your revival of Coach didn't work out, Craig.

36:04.960 --> 36:06.960
Craig, Mr. T. Nelson asks,

36:08.240 --> 36:12.480
is being popular in high school a good skill I can use in a job interview?

36:13.040 --> 36:13.600
Oh, yeah.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.880
Like, one of my best skills was being popular in high school.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.280
Everyone loved being around me and wanted my attention,

36:19.280 --> 36:22.640
so I think I do great in sales in that regard.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.880
Also, I coached the big team.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.920
The big, the big, was it football?

36:27.920 --> 36:30.720
Uh, excuse me, I'm going over your resume here.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.280
It says you coached the big team.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.080
That can't be right.

36:34.080 --> 36:34.560
What, did he do-

36:34.560 --> 36:37.360
It says here you were a super cool dude?

36:37.360 --> 36:39.520
Did he do football or basketball in the television show, Coach?

36:39.520 --> 36:40.480
Are you talking about Coach?

36:40.480 --> 36:40.720
Yeah.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.960
I believe he did the football.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.840
Him and Goonther?

36:45.840 --> 36:46.880
That's not his name, is it?

36:46.880 --> 36:47.520
That's from friends.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.400
We'll probably never know.

36:50.240 --> 36:54.080
Can you be like, I was well liked, so you need me.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.640
I do great in sales in that regard.

36:57.360 --> 37:00.160
I dated all the cheerleaders.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.280
And also was them.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.360
Please let me sell your cars.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.040
I was in a horrific lab accident in high school,

37:07.040 --> 37:09.840
and I became all of the students all at once.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.720
I sort of lost my physical tangible form,

37:12.720 --> 37:14.400
and became sort of just like a nightmare

37:14.400 --> 37:15.520
they all had every night.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.400
But it made me, it did make me very popular.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.280
I was, you could say I was literally on their minds.

37:21.280 --> 37:21.760
Like-

37:21.760 --> 37:24.800
I was kind of a hive mind in high school.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.880
I was on the speech and debate team,

37:26.880 --> 37:28.480
and the football team, and tennis,

37:28.480 --> 37:30.720
and I was a lunch lady and a janitor.

37:30.720 --> 37:34.480
I was Jared from The Pretender when I was in high school,

37:34.480 --> 37:37.840
and I did every job and was every student.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.080
And everybody liked me and was in love with me,

37:40.080 --> 37:41.600
and some thought I was a woman,

37:41.600 --> 37:43.200
and a few thought I was a trash can,

37:43.200 --> 37:44.960
because I was very good at pretending to be a trash can.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.680
I was very good, very convincing.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.880
I was this underground lake of shape-shifting slime

37:51.760 --> 37:54.160
that was below the school,

37:54.160 --> 37:55.920
and at night I would come back

37:55.920 --> 37:57.600
and just sort of repopulate the school,

37:57.600 --> 37:59.600
filling up all of the positions.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.520
Let me show you this yearbook real quick.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.320
That's me, that's me, if you wouldn't know it, that's me.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.800
And the yearbook, the yearbook is made of slime,

38:06.800 --> 38:08.160
and is also part of me.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.000
Anyway, I think I would do great in cells.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.560
Can I sells your cars, please?

38:13.440 --> 38:14.560
Let me ask you this.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.320
Can you try this strategy in a job interview

38:18.320 --> 38:20.800
if you're a hyper-permissive parent

38:20.800 --> 38:24.400
that let high school kids have parties at your house?

38:24.400 --> 38:27.360
Like, listen, let's just, let me just put it this way.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.480
I know a few teens.

38:30.480 --> 38:34.160
I know where they hang out, and it's my house.

38:34.160 --> 38:38.080
I'm pretty plugged in to what teenagers are into.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.680
If you're, oh my God.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.720
Oh my God.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.680
If you had hyper-permissive parents in high school,

38:43.680 --> 38:45.200
if you ever went to somebody's party where it's like,

38:45.200 --> 38:47.360
I don't know, yeah, Dylan's parents

38:47.360 --> 38:50.880
let us have cool, crazy parties at our house constantly.

38:50.880 --> 38:55.360
What if their parents were market researchers?

38:55.360 --> 38:56.800
Like, when you went to the party,

38:56.800 --> 38:58.720
did you ever see like new gadgets

38:58.720 --> 39:00.480
or perhaps a new formulation of breakfast cereal?

39:00.480 --> 39:02.160
Did you have to sign an NDA?

39:02.160 --> 39:04.320
Like, were the boxes unlabeled

39:04.320 --> 39:06.720
and they just had like A, B, and C written on them?

39:06.720 --> 39:07.360
What the fuck?

39:07.360 --> 39:09.520
This Coca-Cola tastes like vanilla.

39:09.520 --> 39:10.320
Yeah, that's strange.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.240
But what did you think about the vanilla Coca-Cola?

39:12.240 --> 39:13.200
Would you tell a friend about it?

39:13.200 --> 39:14.560
Would you tell 10 friends about it?

39:14.560 --> 39:15.200
Would it trend?

39:16.560 --> 39:16.880
Bryce?

39:16.880 --> 39:18.240
Can you fill this form out, please?

39:18.240 --> 39:19.120
Have a great time.

39:19.120 --> 39:22.560
Hi, I'm not Dylan's dad, Bri-boy.

39:24.240 --> 39:24.960
Bri-bri.

39:24.960 --> 39:25.520
Bri-bri.

39:25.520 --> 39:26.080
I'm Bri-bri.

39:26.080 --> 39:26.880
I'm not Dylan's dad.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.840
That's the important thing.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.520
What do you think of the music we're listening to right now?

39:31.520 --> 39:33.520
Is this-

39:33.520 --> 39:34.080
How does this-

39:34.080 --> 39:34.880
Does this make you-

39:34.880 --> 39:36.160
If you were listening to this in a store,

39:36.160 --> 39:38.960
would it make you very compelled to buy something?

39:39.680 --> 39:40.800
Compelled to buy something?

39:41.520 --> 39:42.560
So-so?

39:42.560 --> 39:43.760
Not compelled to buy something?

39:43.760 --> 39:45.680
Or very not compelled to buy something?

39:45.680 --> 39:47.760
Man, these red walls are pretty cool, huh?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.280
What do you think of this color?

39:49.280 --> 39:50.800
Do you think that this color is intriguing?

39:50.800 --> 39:51.840
How does it make you feel?

39:52.640 --> 39:55.360
Make you feel warm or scared?

39:55.360 --> 39:57.040
How long has the pepper spray

39:57.040 --> 39:58.880
that I sprayed in your eyes been burning?

39:58.880 --> 40:00.800
And how much longer do you think it would be burning?

40:00.800 --> 40:01.440
Would this-

40:01.440 --> 40:02.640
I'll let you out of here

40:02.640 --> 40:04.640
as soon as you tell me what I want to know.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.360
Can you escape from the handcuffs?

40:07.360 --> 40:08.080
Are they too tight?

40:08.080 --> 40:09.120
Not tight enough.

40:09.120 --> 40:15.360
I'd like you to meet my friend, Teddy Cruz.

40:15.360 --> 40:16.560
We can just keep his last name Cruz

40:16.560 --> 40:17.840
because it sounds like cool.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.520
This is my friend, Teddy Cruz.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.400
Hey, what's up?

40:20.400 --> 40:21.280
Do I seem affable?

40:21.280 --> 40:22.960
Would you want to get a drink with me?

40:22.960 --> 40:24.080
The only way that this works

40:24.080 --> 40:25.920
is if you roll into the job interview

40:25.920 --> 40:30.480
and do like a sweet kick flip on your skateboard, I guess.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.960
I think everybody's on those rolly boards now.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.320
Okay, you roll in on your rolly boards.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.440
What's a rolly board?

40:35.440 --> 40:36.560
You know a rolly board.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.360
Like the hover.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.240
They're not hover boards,

40:38.240 --> 40:39.120
but everybody calls them that

40:39.120 --> 40:40.640
even though they're not that for sure.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.920
By definition, not that.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.600
But then you roll in, you do a kick flip,

40:43.600 --> 40:46.320
it explodes underneath you and you get the job.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.840
I would give that person a job instantly.

40:47.840 --> 40:48.400
Are you kidding me?

40:48.400 --> 40:49.440
That'd be the fucking sweetest thing

40:49.440 --> 40:50.320
I've ever seen in my life.

40:50.880 --> 40:51.920
What if the person-

40:51.920 --> 40:52.640
Okay, this is-

40:52.640 --> 40:54.720
I was going to just claim this idea as my own,

40:54.720 --> 40:58.160
but a game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

40:58.160 --> 41:03.840
This one is Yahoo Answers user bisexual response.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.000
Really just putting a fine point on it.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.680
Bisexual says,

41:08.720 --> 41:11.040
no, being popular is not a good skill.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.320
It's not a skill at all.

41:12.320 --> 41:15.760
What if the person interviewing you was bullied in school?

41:15.760 --> 41:18.400
What if they were the loser that everyone hated?

41:18.400 --> 41:18.720
Fuck.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.480
Well, then bullying is the skill you'd have to use.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.920
Give me the job, Derek.

41:24.960 --> 41:25.280
Okay.

41:25.280 --> 41:31.680
I'm going to pull out your wiener and show it to the whole office.

41:31.680 --> 41:33.360
No, please, please.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.040
I want six figures.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.960
I'm going to pull out your little boy pee pee

41:36.960 --> 41:38.880
and show it to everybody in the office.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.000
And I'm going to walk you around,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.600
make sure everyone gets a good look at your little wieners.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.160
You can tell-

41:44.160 --> 41:44.960
Is this your family?

41:44.960 --> 41:46.400
Is this a picture of your family?

41:46.400 --> 41:47.360
They're beautiful.

41:48.080 --> 41:48.960
You should be very proud.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.640
You should be proud of this beautiful family you made

41:50.640 --> 41:52.640
with your little wieners.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.280
Wieners.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.560
You fucking overturn a toilet and dump it on him.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.240
I never bullied anybody, so you can tell, like,

42:00.240 --> 42:01.280
I don't know how to do it.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.840
I'll bring the swirly to you.

42:05.680 --> 42:06.640
The lovely suit.

42:07.840 --> 42:10.160
It would be a shame for anything to happen to it.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.360
Justin, you want to read another question?

42:14.080 --> 42:15.360
I would love to.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.040
More questions in 2016.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.160
That's my thing.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.560
I had to console my kindergartners today

42:20.560 --> 42:24.320
when they found out George Washington died.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.520
Rule of threes, man.

42:29.920 --> 42:32.080
Next week, we're studying Abraham Lincoln.

42:33.680 --> 42:37.280
How can I make next week's topic less traumatizing?

42:37.280 --> 42:38.720
Especially when little Billy said,

42:38.720 --> 42:41.360
just as long as Abraham Lincoln's fine.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.960
Washington I could deal with, okay?

42:43.760 --> 42:44.240
I get it.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.560
He was old as fuck, but Lenko?

42:46.560 --> 42:47.440
Let me finish the question.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.520
That's from Bearer of Bad News in California.

42:49.520 --> 42:49.920
Thank you.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.640
Okay, now do your little jokes.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.800
It is kind of a shame that you would have to spend

42:54.800 --> 42:56.640
the whole class period building up

42:56.640 --> 42:59.200
how awesome George Washington was,

42:59.200 --> 43:00.800
and it's always going to end with,

43:01.520 --> 43:02.320
then he died.

43:03.280 --> 43:06.560
He was a super cool dude who did a lot of awesome stuff.

43:07.280 --> 43:07.920
He's dead.

43:07.920 --> 43:08.560
He was pretty sick.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.640
Yeah, you know how he died of bloodletting?

43:13.280 --> 43:13.680
Really?

43:13.680 --> 43:15.280
You guys are like, we did it to him.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.280
He had pneumonia and they put leeches on him.

43:17.280 --> 43:20.160
They leave that out of Hamilton.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.520
Yeah, that would be great.

43:21.520 --> 43:23.520
One last ride.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.440
Anyway, I'm going to go to the doctor.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.160
We'll catch you guys on the Flippy Dip.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.120
I don't think it will be any problem at all.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.040
It should be pretty intense.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.680
Right back, and then we're going to that new hand place

43:35.680 --> 43:36.720
at 630, right?

43:36.720 --> 43:37.440
Tight, tight, tight.

43:37.440 --> 43:38.240
Meet you there.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.840
Anyway, hey, yo, doc, what's up?

43:39.840 --> 43:41.840
And then I've got a plan for universal health care.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.840
I'll tell you guys, we're the third page

43:45.840 --> 43:47.680
of the Declaration of Independence is buried.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.240
And I tell you guys, I got this great plan.

43:50.240 --> 43:53.280
It's called getting rid of slavery right now in 1770,

43:53.280 --> 43:54.640
whatever, BRB.

43:54.640 --> 43:55.600
Cool, cool, cool.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.600
Listen, I'm halfway done signing the executive order,

43:59.600 --> 44:01.360
but I got the carpal tunnel.

44:01.360 --> 44:04.160
So I'm going to take a quick physician break

44:04.160 --> 44:06.480
and then I'll get back to signing in the executive order

44:06.480 --> 44:07.440
to end slavery.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.280
I'll just put that Washington on there.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.520
Oh, that's rough.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.880
You got to lie to him.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.000
And then he ascended.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.120
Well, no, not that.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.320
Just like, he's still around.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.520
Wait, how is that better?

44:25.520 --> 44:26.800
I mean, he's watching us all to this day.

44:26.800 --> 44:31.920
Abraham Lincoln, one of our bravest, our most decisive,

44:31.920 --> 44:34.320
and also our most secretive president.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.640
Whereas he today, nobody knows.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.360
No, that's horse apples because there's seven billion people

44:39.360 --> 44:40.800
on Earth now.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.280
In your lifetime, you meet like, what, like 100?

44:43.280 --> 44:45.040
And then Abe Lincoln, statistically,

44:45.040 --> 44:46.560
probably is not going to be one of those.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.240
It's like Bigfoot.

44:48.800 --> 44:51.200
The story is, the story you give them is this.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.320
Abraham Lincoln was watching a play.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.800
He got shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth.

44:56.800 --> 44:57.040
No, he missed.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.120
Three days later, no, he got better.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.720
And he's like, well, I'm not going to do this again.

45:01.520 --> 45:02.320
Fuck this shit.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.040
Fuck this.

45:03.040 --> 45:03.680
I'm out.

45:03.680 --> 45:04.880
Did you see that shit?

45:04.880 --> 45:06.160
I got shot by it, dude.

45:06.160 --> 45:07.680
I got shot in the head.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.120
Like, I have to go.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.400
I don't want to be around anymore.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.760
Somebody else can be president.

45:11.760 --> 45:12.720
Where are you going to go?

45:12.720 --> 45:16.000
I'm going to go plant apple trees across this great nation

45:16.000 --> 45:16.480
of ours.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.080
And I'm going to just travel, see the world.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.320
And that's the story of The Pretender.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.560
I'm going to go start an anonymous.

45:25.760 --> 45:26.800
I'm going to go start an anonymous.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.800
Let stupid Andrew Johnson be president for a while.

45:28.800 --> 45:30.320
Let people take pot shots at him.

45:30.320 --> 45:30.880
This is not-

45:30.880 --> 45:31.360
Who?

45:31.360 --> 45:32.160
I'm sorry, who?

45:32.880 --> 45:33.760
Andrew Johnson?

45:33.760 --> 45:36.320
Our 17th president?

45:36.320 --> 45:37.200
Is that a real guy?

45:38.560 --> 45:39.120
Wow.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.200
Maybe Andrew Johnson's our most secretive president.

45:44.720 --> 45:45.280
I can-

45:45.280 --> 45:46.640
Do you want me to skip ahead to Grant?

45:46.640 --> 45:47.760
I'll skip to Grant.

45:47.760 --> 45:52.080
I think I only know Washington, Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Garfield.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.160
Yeah, I know of JFK.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.600
Travis, don't stop.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.320
There's all the presidents to go.

45:56.320 --> 46:00.160
Isn't JFK when you are playing wow when you have to leave the room?

46:00.160 --> 46:00.720
Stop it.

46:00.720 --> 46:04.720
JFK, bio break.

46:04.720 --> 46:05.280
Bio break.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.480
I'm watching JFK on Netflix.

46:11.040 --> 46:11.600
Be right back.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.360
Gotta find out who this dude is, JFK.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.680
Hey guys, we can start the raid back and to the left.

46:18.160 --> 46:18.640
Solid.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.440
I don't know my presidents.

46:21.440 --> 46:21.920
Who did you think-

46:22.960 --> 46:25.040
What do you think happened after Abe Lincoln got his-

46:25.520 --> 46:26.000
Got-

46:26.000 --> 46:27.280
They took some time off?

46:27.280 --> 46:28.320
No, I'm saying-

46:28.320 --> 46:30.960
Okay, but like, who do you think followed him?

46:32.400 --> 46:34.560
I mean, I know it was the next president.

46:36.480 --> 46:40.880
But like, how do you follow up Lincoln and everybody's like, you're just as good?

46:41.760 --> 46:44.800
I think you're destined to be forgotten if you're the guy after Lincoln.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.640
That's a good point.

46:46.640 --> 46:47.600
Tell me anything about-

46:47.600 --> 46:49.840
Please tell me about this Andrew Johnson guy, please.

46:49.840 --> 46:50.320
Anything?

46:52.160 --> 46:54.560
He got probably a pretty surprising telegram one day.

46:54.560 --> 46:55.520
Okay.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.200
I never thought it would happen to me.

46:59.920 --> 47:00.560
He was at-

47:00.560 --> 47:04.480
He was just in a mall with all of his friends and his dad just finished saying,

47:04.480 --> 47:06.640
Andrew Johnson, you'll never amount to anything.

47:06.640 --> 47:07.920
You've got to get serious.

47:07.920 --> 47:13.360
And Andrew Johnson was all at the mall with his friends and he was at the Panda Express

47:13.360 --> 47:15.520
and he's like, I don't have to listen to him.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.040
What's the worst that could happen?

47:17.040 --> 47:19.920
And then he gets a telegram saying, you're president of the United States.

47:19.920 --> 47:25.120
So him and his bodyguard Sinbad went to DC and they started running the country,

47:25.120 --> 47:27.840
but they started running it how a kid would.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.440
So it's like, not the kid's style.

47:29.440 --> 47:32.560
It's like, everybody gets free hot dogs.

47:32.560 --> 47:38.800
And he filled the Oval Office pool with marshmallows and stuff and he made it.

47:38.800 --> 47:46.960
And some of his stuffy cabinet members, he made them all wear sunglasses and

47:46.960 --> 47:50.160
say executive orders like, what's up, dude? And things like that.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.680
And that's how Andrew Johnson, kid president, got his start.

47:53.680 --> 47:56.080
He was a way better president than Lincoln.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.560
Yeah, he was a really cool president, people don't remember.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.040
And that is-

47:59.040 --> 48:00.320
And how long was he president?

48:00.880 --> 48:02.320
Until he was impeached, I think.

48:04.160 --> 48:06.400
By which they mean they put him in a big vat of pizzas.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.400
No, I mean he was impeached.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.440
Oh no.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.720
Oh no, what happened?

48:10.720 --> 48:12.160
Don't tell your kindergartners that.

48:12.160 --> 48:13.520
That's going to really bum them out.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.840
Lincoln's dead, but I think Johnson got impeached.

48:15.840 --> 48:19.040
What? After he did that cool thing with the shades?

48:20.240 --> 48:22.240
Wait, no, he was not impeached.

48:22.240 --> 48:22.720
Not on me.

48:22.720 --> 48:25.680
No, don't like fucking cast dispersions.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.240
You're the one who told me about his marshmallow pool.

48:28.240 --> 48:29.600
What are you worried about factually after-

48:29.600 --> 48:31.360
Yeah, but they didn't impeach him.

48:31.360 --> 48:34.960
They learned like, listen, we've been too serious about everything.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.320
We really need to loosen it up.

48:37.200 --> 48:40.960
He impeached himself because he knew that was the right thing to do for the country.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.600
He was the only other president to be impeached other than Bill Clinton.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.160
Is that real?

48:44.160 --> 48:45.120
No.

48:45.120 --> 48:48.560
Someday somebody's going to write a fucking musical about how fucking wrong you guys are

48:48.560 --> 48:49.840
about Andrew Johnson right now.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.520
Called Not Without My Johnson.

48:51.520 --> 48:52.020
Stop!

48:53.600 --> 48:54.560
How could this happen?

48:56.080 --> 48:57.360
Yeah, he didn't do a good job.

49:01.040 --> 49:05.760
In his defense, in Andrew Johnson's defense, he probably didn't think history would remember.

49:05.760 --> 49:09.920
And by the way, if Andrew Johnson's whole fucking scam was like,

49:09.920 --> 49:16.000
I'm actually going to live super high on the hog and like get crazy and buckwild constantly

49:16.000 --> 49:20.800
and steal from America and do whatever I want and have sex with lots of broads and guys,

49:20.800 --> 49:23.600
whatever, I don't care because history will not remember.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.080
And then my middle brother was like, Andrew who?

49:26.080 --> 49:29.200
I think his plan worked out perfect.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.240
Somewhere he dropped his shades and went, exactly.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.040
Exactly.

49:33.040 --> 49:39.200
That would be an amazing, now that I think about it, that would be an amazing musical.

49:39.200 --> 49:40.000
That'd be an amazing-

49:40.000 --> 49:41.040
Andrew Johnson's day off.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.920
Andrew, please fucking govern the country.

49:43.920 --> 49:46.480
Nah, I'm going to go bust a nut.

49:47.200 --> 49:50.480
Andrew, please God, do anything.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.800
Our nation is being torn apart right now.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.080
Nah, nah, nah.

49:54.080 --> 49:55.200
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.040
Nah, passing it in bonbons.

49:57.040 --> 49:59.840
Even those bonbons are stuffed with money.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.320
It's all about the Johnsons, babe.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.040
You don't have a currency named after you.

50:07.040 --> 50:07.440
Nah.

50:07.440 --> 50:08.640
It's the $18 bill.

50:08.640 --> 50:09.600
Not yet.

50:09.600 --> 50:11.200
Have you been taking bribes?

50:11.200 --> 50:11.680
Yes.

50:11.680 --> 50:12.320
And peyote.

50:12.320 --> 50:15.440
You guys want to know the dirty shit he did?

50:16.000 --> 50:16.560
You ready?

50:17.280 --> 50:17.600
Yes.

50:18.480 --> 50:21.680
Get your ears ready because this shit's dirty.

50:21.680 --> 50:25.360
Call Danielle Steele because it's about to get ribbled in here.

50:26.160 --> 50:31.120
The House's primary charge against Johnson was the violation of the Tenure of Office Act

50:31.120 --> 50:32.880
passed by Congress the previous year.

50:32.880 --> 50:37.040
Specifically, he had removed Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War,

50:37.040 --> 50:40.800
whom the Tenure of Office Act was largely designed to protect, from office

50:40.800 --> 50:43.360
and replaced it with General Ulysses S. Grant.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.840
So he booted a dude.

50:45.840 --> 50:49.520
He booted a dude who had a law made that you couldn't boot him.

50:49.520 --> 50:53.600
How bad was he at his job that his friends had to pass a law to protect him?

50:53.600 --> 50:58.240
I know you dudes are gonna have to impeach me, but like, I gotta do what I gotta do.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.240
I gotta get this fool out of office.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.000
He's the only one who knows my secrets.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.200
I gotta bust my nut.

51:03.200 --> 51:06.560
If that guy walked into the Oval Office like,

51:06.560 --> 51:08.400
President Johnson, what are you doing?

51:08.400 --> 51:10.880
You're out of here, war general guy.

51:10.880 --> 51:14.720
Can I suggest a sub-podcast, like a new podcast series,

51:14.720 --> 51:20.800
where we just go like, it's only like 40 episodes long.

51:20.800 --> 51:24.320
We just get every president, his like, dude.

51:24.320 --> 51:27.840
So no, you cannot hide from our ever-watchful eye.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.360
Like, I want to get all the presidents.

51:30.320 --> 51:31.840
Look at you, Polk.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.360
But you know what? I'm sorry.

51:33.360 --> 51:36.800
I've seen Hamilton twice, and you'll never convince me he wasn't our best president.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.520
Oh, fuck.

51:39.520 --> 51:42.000
That's the end of the show.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.320
Thank you so much for listening to it.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.120
I hope you had fun.

51:45.760 --> 51:49.040
We have two new, very exciting projects to tell you about.

51:49.920 --> 51:53.840
On Tuesday, which is tomorrow, you're gonna get two new podcasts.

51:54.640 --> 51:56.000
One is called Still Buffering.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.800
That's my wife, Sydney, and my sister-in-law, Riley, who is a teenager.

52:00.800 --> 52:05.520
And talking about, like, how it was being a teen when they were growing up.

52:05.520 --> 52:08.320
And how it is now for teenagers.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.520
I learned a lot.

52:09.520 --> 52:13.200
Like, it made me feel kind of old, but also kind of plugged in.

52:13.200 --> 52:17.040
Because I wasn't aware that, like, Sydney mentioned bringing,

52:17.040 --> 52:21.840
on the first episode, Sydney mentioned bringing, like, a folder of CDs to a party.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.640
And Riley was, like, in terror at that idea.

52:24.640 --> 52:28.000
I was like, oh my god, I guess it is kind of whack.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.760
I didn't even really think about it.

52:29.760 --> 52:31.520
But that's called Still Buffering.

52:31.520 --> 52:32.640
And that's on Tuesday.

52:32.640 --> 52:35.280
Trav, do you want to tell them about the other show that will normally be on Fridays,

52:35.280 --> 52:37.680
but will also have its first episode on Tuesday?

52:37.680 --> 52:39.920
Yeah, we're launching a show called Schmanners.

52:40.480 --> 52:45.760
It's me and my wife, Theresa McElroy, talking about etiquette and manners in the modern age.

52:45.760 --> 52:50.880
And some stuff that may seem old-fashioned and a little archaic.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.960
But I think it still applies in the modern world.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.920
And that's kind of our hypothesis.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.800
So our first episode is dealing with thank you notes.

52:58.800 --> 53:01.680
And our second episode is all about table manners.

53:02.320 --> 53:05.040
The first episode is coming out Tuesday, so tomorrow.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.480
And the second one will be on Friday.

53:06.480 --> 53:09.120
So you'll get a double dose this first week.

53:09.120 --> 53:11.680
And then after that, every episode will be up on Friday.

53:11.680 --> 53:12.800
I'm really looking forward to it.

53:12.800 --> 53:17.440
My wife is, like, really, really good at this and knows way more about manners and etiquette than I do.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.600
And I make no claim to know anything about them.

53:19.600 --> 53:23.680
And if you want to find out more about it or just find links to, like, check out the promos,

53:23.680 --> 53:24.640
I'm going to remind you.

53:24.640 --> 53:29.040
McElroyShows.com has links to all of our projects, including the video projects.

53:29.040 --> 53:32.000
So you can find all the My Brother, My Brother, and Me videos.

53:33.040 --> 53:34.560
The Monster Factory videos.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.440
Griffin's Amiibo Corner.

53:35.440 --> 53:35.680
Thank you.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.000
There's a new one up, by the way, if you haven't seen it, of Yoshi.

53:38.000 --> 53:38.480
Ooh!

53:38.480 --> 53:39.200
New Yoshi.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.800
And maybe some other stuff you didn't already know about.

53:42.800 --> 53:46.000
And there's links to all the Twitter accounts and Facebook groups and everything.

53:46.000 --> 53:46.720
Go check it out.

53:46.720 --> 53:48.960
And Rachel and I have a podcast called Rose Buddies.

53:48.960 --> 53:49.840
We talk about The Bachelor.

53:49.840 --> 53:50.400
It's pretty good.

53:51.120 --> 53:54.480
And I'm going to get it in a podcast feed before this episode goes up.

53:54.480 --> 53:55.360
There, I've said.

53:55.360 --> 53:56.400
I threw my hat over the fence.

53:57.520 --> 53:59.440
I also want to say I got the new P.O. Box set up.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.000
Oh, nice.

54:00.800 --> 54:06.560
Yeah, it's P.O. Box 909, Van Nuys, California, 91408.

54:07.280 --> 54:11.360
And I want to thank everybody who sent stuff already.

54:11.360 --> 54:15.680
We got a bunch of presents in the old P.O. Box.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.600
So thanks everybody who sent something.

54:17.600 --> 54:23.840
I want to say a special thank you to Stuart Wellington, who sent me some immune boosters

54:23.840 --> 54:29.360
and a first aid kit because I have announced that should I die, Stuart has to take over

54:29.360 --> 54:31.280
for me until death do us part.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.600
And he's trying to keep me alive as long as he can.

54:34.240 --> 54:38.320
And should Abraham Lincoln die, I will take over as the nation's chillest dude.

54:39.120 --> 54:41.520
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

54:41.520 --> 54:43.360
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.120
You can find it on iTunes.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.720
You can find it on Amazon.

54:46.720 --> 54:48.720
You can find it wherever music is sold.

54:48.720 --> 54:49.360
Suncoast?

54:50.560 --> 54:51.120
Is that still a thing?

54:51.120 --> 54:52.400
Suncoast, maybe?

54:52.400 --> 54:54.160
Sam Goody?

54:54.160 --> 54:56.480
You could probably just buy a Sam Goody at this point.

54:56.480 --> 54:56.880
Yeah, sure.

54:57.440 --> 55:00.240
And then just keep all the Long Winters albums you find there.

55:01.680 --> 55:02.960
And did we say the other max-

55:02.960 --> 55:04.960
God, Sam Goody's been out of business for a decade.

55:04.960 --> 55:05.680
Oh my god.

55:06.480 --> 55:08.240
Did we say to listen to the other max fun shows?

55:08.880 --> 55:09.520
Do that.

55:09.520 --> 55:11.360
Yeah, go listen to the other max fun shows.

55:11.360 --> 55:14.640
Stop podcasting yourself, Jordan Jesse Goh, Throwing Shade.

55:23.680 --> 55:24.320
Thank you, Drew.

55:24.320 --> 55:27.280
It's by Yajur Answers user Cole who asks,

55:28.160 --> 55:33.840
are all Power Rangers episodes swearless or do some have swearing for my kids?

55:36.160 --> 55:37.040
God, I wish.

55:37.040 --> 55:38.960
My name is Justin McElroy.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.480
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:40.480 --> 55:41.760

55:41.760 --> 55:43.040

55:43.040 --> 55:44.320
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

55:44.320 --> 55:53.920
Kiss your dad, scratch the lips.

Hello, internet.

56:09.840 --> 56:11.360
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:11.360 --> 56:12.880
And I'm Theresa McElroy.

56:12.880 --> 56:13.920
She is my wife.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.120
And he's my husband.

56:15.120 --> 56:18.240
And it is our pleasure to introduce to you a brand new podcast.

56:18.880 --> 56:20.240
Shmanners.

56:20.240 --> 56:21.920
It's extraordinary etiquette.

56:21.920 --> 56:23.440
For ordinary occasions.

56:23.440 --> 56:24.720
Theresa, let me ask you this.

56:24.720 --> 56:27.040
Can you teach me how to write a thank you note?

56:27.040 --> 56:28.080
Yes, I can.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.320
How about tips to improve my table manners?

56:30.320 --> 56:31.760
I'll do my best.

56:31.760 --> 56:36.480
And will you finally explain to me the difference between casual and business casual

56:36.480 --> 56:40.160
and cocktail and formal and black tie and all that stuff?

56:40.160 --> 56:42.240
If anybody can, I can.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.840
But like, it's going to be funny, right?

56:43.840 --> 56:44.880
Of course.

56:44.880 --> 56:51.360
I'm going to give historical origins and how those manners fit into our everyday lives.

56:51.360 --> 56:52.880
How could it not be funny?

56:52.880 --> 56:56.160
But also sometimes we'll talk about like burps and farts, right?

56:56.160 --> 56:57.280
Yeah, when not to.

56:57.280 --> 56:58.480
But we'll still talk about it.

56:59.120 --> 56:59.920
Yes.

56:59.920 --> 57:00.320
Great.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.960
