00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.080
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era. A historic

00:51.200 --> 00:59.040
week indeed. We now live in a nation where our president, Barack Hussein Obama, has declared

00:59.040 --> 01:09.440
everyone is gay. Yep. What's so funny, Travis? No, I'm just, I was so excited. That was the

01:09.440 --> 01:16.320
laughter of excitement. It's a major sea change. His announcement was so monumental. I just like,

01:16.320 --> 01:24.000
I turned, I turned to all my friends and I said, today we, we are all gay. And then we just like

01:24.000 --> 01:31.600
started scooping it. Yeah. Bottoms up, if you know what I mean. I said, today's the day we celebrate

01:31.600 --> 01:37.760
our independence, gay. It was so strange because I was in a room with a bunch of guys

01:37.760 --> 01:46.320
and what was previously a comfortable gathering of bros hoisting and watching the news together,

01:46.960 --> 01:53.680
there was suddenly like so many layers of sexual tension, you know? You just put all the dicks in

01:53.680 --> 02:00.640
the middle, made a dick octopus. You were in a news bar? I was in a news bar. No. Travis, I was

02:00.640 --> 02:09.200
having my, my Thursday afternoon, just news hoist, just a bunch of bros hoisting a few brews and

02:09.200 --> 02:13.680
watching the news. Brews and news, I call it. Brews and news. Yeah. Brews and news, I call it.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.400
You do it after legs and eggs at the landing strip.

02:16.400 --> 02:24.240
Uh, so welcome to the first episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me that is completely

02:24.240 --> 02:30.240
a hundred percent, uh, uh, gay. I'm your oldest and by extension gayest brother,

02:30.240 --> 02:34.640
Justin McElroy. Is that how that works? I'm the middle-est and gayest brother.

02:36.080 --> 02:44.080
I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm your youngest brother and, um, it's Adam and Eve, you guys. Yeah.

02:44.080 --> 02:50.560
Whoa. I didn't get, I didn't get hit. You're a federal outlaw now. I'm in the middle of Texas.

02:50.560 --> 02:55.920
The wave didn't reach me here. The sonar pulse that he sent out.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.880
It sounded, it sounded, it sounded exactly like a DeBarge record, which I thought was very strange.

03:04.880 --> 03:09.760
You just feel to the beat of the rhythm of the night, just pulsing throughout the entire country

03:09.760 --> 03:15.360
and it just flipped. I thought I heard, I had my windows down, but again, I'm so far away.

03:15.360 --> 03:20.080
I thought I heard all things just keep getting better by a wildlife. Like I thought I heard

03:20.080 --> 03:24.240
wildlife. I thought I heard the wildlife wave crash against Austin shores, but

03:24.960 --> 03:30.560
didn't make it through Hill country. Yeah. Too much obstruction. Uh, yeah. Griffin. Yeah.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.960
It didn't get all the way. The only effects there is Griffin is dressing really well now.

03:34.960 --> 03:40.320
That's the only thing. Oh, I look great. He looks fantastic. You're fit. Uh, tan looks,

03:40.320 --> 03:45.760
looks great. Uh, just prefers ladies still. Uh, so why don't you guys go over to,

03:45.760 --> 03:49.200
why don't you guys go listen to throwing shade? They're going to, they're probably going to have

03:49.200 --> 03:53.120
a lot more informed opinion. They're probably going to sound a lot more informed, probably

03:53.120 --> 03:58.560
going to sound a lot less stupid when they talk about this thing. Congratulations. Congratulations.

03:58.560 --> 04:03.920
Just everyone. Yeah. Except for, except for people who hate, uh, homosexuals and anybody

04:03.920 --> 04:12.640
sort of anti LGBT. Um, in which case go fuck off. Yeah. You suck. Yeah. And I say that now

04:12.640 --> 04:19.840
deep down or the conviction of a man living a gay life and I, I'm, and I, I now hate those people.

04:19.840 --> 04:24.400
I don't think you know what, I don't think, you know, a gay means cause I don't like you're

04:24.400 --> 04:30.240
married to a woman. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that you, that you, that presumably you love it's a

04:30.240 --> 04:34.720
federal law. Griffin. I'm not, I'm not going to throw it in the face of the authorities and say

04:34.720 --> 04:39.280
that I'm straight president. Doesn't just like come out and say stuff like this on a whim.

04:39.280 --> 04:44.960
Right. That's true. He did polling research. He signed things. Things were signed. Yeah. Yeah.

04:44.960 --> 04:49.520
There's, there's significant policy coming, but nope. There's, but there's, oh, there's not.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.640
Nevermind. Next, next question. First question. The president did polling research that I wanted

04:54.640 --> 05:00.640
to research polls. He knows, he knows what's up. He called up, he called up Joey Lucas. He's like,

05:00.640 --> 05:08.560
Hey, how do we feel about gays today? We cool. Am I good? Joey, are you there? Hello?

05:09.280 --> 05:14.080
Oh, you're fictional. Fuck. Unpredictably the president, the president's gay polarity beam

05:14.080 --> 05:20.240
actually gave her her hearing back. So yeah, it's a big day for her. Hey, that was the first episode

05:20.240 --> 05:27.040
of season eight. God damn it. God damn it. Obama winter little lies. Okay. In a relationship,

05:27.040 --> 05:32.160
my husband is very loosey goosey when it comes to adhering to best before dates and hates wasting

05:32.160 --> 05:38.160
food. Sometimes when he's at work, I throw things away and tell him I ate it. Am I wrong?

05:39.760 --> 05:44.800
Um, before we, before we address the bigger question here, your husband is right and you

05:44.800 --> 05:48.800
are wrong. Best before dates are there for a reason. They wouldn't put that date on there.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.200
If there wasn't something bad that happened after that date, you shouldn't keep it in the house.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.440
No, no. Then, then she's right. Then you are right. And your husband is wrong. Yeah. Yeah.

05:57.440 --> 06:02.960
That's that's no, no. I sometimes just to be safe, I'll go like three days before.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.680
No way. It's not an exact science. There's no way they can pinpoint that day. If so,

06:07.680 --> 06:13.520
they're precogs. That's a bigger problem. Your systems, your system needs that bad stuff,

06:13.520 --> 06:18.000
trying to hurt it or else it's going to get like, it's like attachment parenting right now. What

06:18.000 --> 06:21.840
you guys are doing is attachment parenting for your immune systems. Justin, why would they put

06:21.840 --> 06:26.320
a best before date if it wasn't bad after that day? I'm sorry, Travis. Are you going to let,

06:27.280 --> 06:31.440
they want you to go to the store and buy new stuff. Are you going to let big dairy tell you

06:31.440 --> 06:37.120
when you can eat something or are you just going to eat it? You know, yes I am. In this circumstance,

06:37.120 --> 06:41.200
big dairy, you're in control, big buddy. Your body knows when something is bad. If there's a

06:41.200 --> 06:44.400
bubble in your tomato sauce. Yes, and you know what's important to my body? My eyes and my brain

06:44.400 --> 06:49.440
that look at the best before date and my brain goes, you got it, bro. I have a carton of buttermilk

06:49.440 --> 06:55.680
that I bought solely to make biscuits about a month ago and it is best before day is May 1st.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.240
I'm pretty sure if I crack that bad boy open, it's going to be dumplings. I'm afraid to look in it.

07:00.240 --> 07:07.120
It made biscuits itself. No, that's right. I don't know. Like I'm afraid to touch

07:07.120 --> 07:13.600
stuff once it's past the date, let alone consume it with my mouth. So, so a panel of three experts,

07:13.600 --> 07:18.480
two against one. Travis and I win. Fair enough. The second issue though, is that how do you want

07:18.480 --> 07:25.040
your husband to look at you when he comes home from work and you're like, Hey, um, you remember

07:25.040 --> 07:32.800
that like totally gnar hummus. Hey hon, I ate all the ranch. You're like, I'm not sure if I should

07:32.800 --> 07:39.920
eat the hummus cause it looks kind of gnar. It's got a face now. Like, yeah, I totally consumed it.

07:39.920 --> 07:47.520
I don't even know how you bring it up in conversation. Hey hon, how was your day?

07:47.520 --> 07:51.280
Oh, mine was pretty good. Just you grubbing on a bunch of rotten food.

07:52.400 --> 07:58.000
I just ate like a tub of sour cream that did not begin a sour cream. Yeah, just grubbing on rotten

07:58.000 --> 08:05.440
food like that makes you so proud. This is what I picture him coming home and going to throw

08:05.440 --> 08:11.040
something away and opening the trashcan and it's just full of like salad dressing containers,

08:11.040 --> 08:18.400
you know? And he's like, honey, what, what is the meaning of this? Yeah. Just slamming some Caesar.

08:18.400 --> 08:24.640
Don't worry about it. I saw the thousand island and I just couldn't stop myself. I'm a growing lady.

08:24.640 --> 08:30.000
I gotta, you know, your husband loves you. He shouldn't want you to eat rotten food.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.640
Well, that's how you got to pitch it to him, right? So, so that he doesn't get upset. You

08:34.640 --> 08:39.920
got to say, listen, I knew you were going to eat that totally gnar hummus with a face. Like,

08:39.920 --> 08:44.960
I knew that when you got home from work, you were going to take your coat off. You're going to say,

08:44.960 --> 08:49.200
hi honey, and smooch me on the cheek. And then you were going to go dip into that gnar hummus

08:49.200 --> 08:52.960
and I didn't want you to hurt yourself. So I jumped on that grenade for you.

08:53.680 --> 08:57.920
I think that's the answer to the question of when are little lies okay for their own protection?

08:59.040 --> 09:02.560
But then he's going to start thinking you're some sort of fucking superhero because you're like,

09:02.560 --> 09:08.720
baby, that, that hummus had hair. Like, you ate it and you're totally fine. He's going to think

09:08.720 --> 09:12.800
you're, you're a fucking Rasputin or something. What if you guys are ever locked in a prison

09:12.800 --> 09:19.120
of rotten food? He's going to be like, well, no worries. That's your manna. You love that.

09:19.120 --> 09:23.280
I know that's your jam is the rotten food and rotten man. Otherwise you've just been lying to

09:23.280 --> 09:27.600
me all these years and I can't believe that because you love me so much. Don't lie to him.

09:27.600 --> 09:32.880
Go straight to his face and say, uh, Hey Doug, if you cared so much about wasting food,

09:32.880 --> 09:39.040
then you should have eaten that hummus before it got so rowdy. Like you, you owe it to me to not

09:39.040 --> 09:46.400
have rotten food in our house. Just eat it all next time before the date. Just don't lie to him.

09:46.400 --> 09:51.920
This is, this is one Oh one. You're trying to save him from eating rotten food. If you feel like this

09:51.920 --> 09:59.200
is a moment for education, not deception, educate. If he's a grown ass man, he's had plenty of time

09:59.200 --> 10:04.000
to break this habit and he hasn't, but some dudes are big dumb animals when it comes to this kind

10:04.000 --> 10:08.080
of stuff. And it sounds like your, your husband is one of those kinds of people and that's fine.

10:08.880 --> 10:15.200
Maybe you just got to let him get like really, really raunchy Ria. Let him like eat all the

10:15.200 --> 10:21.280
totally rowdy hummus. Let him eat that meatloaf that you guys made six months ago. Let him eat

10:21.280 --> 10:26.800
that wheel of cheese that it looks like the fucking Necronomicon. Like let him eat all of

10:26.800 --> 10:34.240
that shit. And then when he gets totally blasted down there, when he almost dies from it and

10:34.240 --> 10:39.200
claws his way back from the edge of death, just look at him and say, hmm, looks like we've learned

10:39.200 --> 10:44.160
a little something here. Leave the lid off the trash can. And when he gets home to say, okay,

10:44.160 --> 10:48.960
Doug, I put rotten food in our trash. If you love it so much, then you go over there and you eat

10:48.960 --> 10:53.920
that trash food. You pull it out of the trash and you eat it. Pull it out of the trash like an animal

10:53.920 --> 10:59.600
and you eat it. Get over there, raccoon Doug. Go to town. Otherwise go to Kroger and buy some new

10:59.600 --> 11:05.200
hummus. Fuck. Here's two dollars. Go buy some fucking hummus, Doug. Two dollars. Now go replace

11:05.200 --> 11:10.960
the eggs. I threw them away. They smelled like bacon. They were hatching. They were hatching.

11:11.680 --> 11:18.000
And I don't want chicks in the house. Draw a line in the sand somewhere. Man,

11:18.000 --> 11:22.400
the whole food thing was ruined for me by taking a food handling courses and watching like the

11:22.400 --> 11:29.360
danger zone videos. Oh my God. Everything is the day. Unless your shit is like cryogenically vacuum

11:29.360 --> 11:36.720
sealed. Yeah. It's, it's in the goddamn danger zone. It's like, if it's not above 120 or below

11:36.720 --> 11:44.400
30 degrees, it's bad for you. It'll kill you. And it's at last that best by date is a pretty liberal.

11:44.400 --> 11:50.080
Yeah. Your food, once you take it into the danger zone, you can't take it back out again. You,

11:50.080 --> 11:55.200
you set off a timer and that time was like 15 minutes. And it was always like, oh,

11:55.200 --> 12:00.480
the food didn't touch the counter. Did it? Oh no. Danger zone. Yeah. Cause, because chicken,

12:00.480 --> 12:06.880
raw chicken touched that counter once 12 years ago. And that's like, it was a night like this.

12:06.880 --> 12:12.640
Yeah. Over 12 years ago. So that counters done. Got to get new counters. I had an odd experience

12:12.640 --> 12:19.280
with expiration dates this week. My lady, my wife was, was craving some chocolate. So I said, hold

12:19.280 --> 12:24.320
on. I got a secret. I got a secret bag of Lindor truffles that I keep for just such an occasion.

12:24.320 --> 12:29.840
So I go get the bag of Lindor truffles and she like pops one in and it starts eating it. And

12:30.800 --> 12:36.320
then she gets his weird look on her face and she picks up the bag and examine it. Apparently the

12:36.320 --> 12:43.120
best buy date was in 2010. Oh no. So they were a little, you know that weird, like when the chocolate

12:43.120 --> 12:47.760
gets white and you're like, oh man, I don't know what this is all about. So we go and we throw the

12:47.760 --> 12:54.800
whole bag out. Uh, today I see that some of them has gotten into the trash and scattered around

12:54.800 --> 13:02.080
our trashcan is like 15 individual Lindor truffle wrappers. You're saying outside of your house,

13:02.080 --> 13:08.960
not like Sydney snuck down and there was some raccoon sitting outside my house last night or

13:08.960 --> 13:17.520
something. Oh, I shouldn't, but I will. Oh, it's going to go straight to my hips. I'll treat myself.

13:17.520 --> 13:24.160
Oh, Michael, you ring tailed kook. You bastard. Those don't taste good. Trust me. I'm a human.

13:24.160 --> 13:31.280
And I know, uh, Griffin, did we get a Yahoo's this week? We got several. I just want to just

13:31.280 --> 13:37.920
luxuriate in this mental picture of a raccoon sitting sort of Cheshire cat style. This legs

13:37.920 --> 13:44.480
cross like, Oh hello. They must be right. They're rappers. He probably does the thing where like,

13:44.480 --> 13:49.040
he puts it in his teeth and holds one end and like pulls it out. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's

13:49.040 --> 13:54.640
a definitely two raccoon operation. No, Bob, get over here. I need you to help me crack this.

13:54.640 --> 14:01.280
It just became twice as adorable. They opened my trashcan lid and left it all around. And

14:01.920 --> 14:06.480
when Sydney and I went out this morning, the first words out of my fucking stupid mouth were,

14:06.480 --> 14:13.040
you think you think it's a bear? Yeah, it's a bear. It's a bear that takes the lid off

14:13.040 --> 14:23.200
your trashcan and individually opens. Yeah. It's blue. You just have a neighbor who saw you carrying

14:23.200 --> 14:28.160
the trash out and saw like the Lindor bag trash bag. And they're like, I'm getting on that. If

14:28.160 --> 14:33.840
they go to bed, I'm going to tear it up and make it look like a raccoon. That looks like a pretty

14:33.840 --> 14:39.840
full bag of troubles. Crime. The perfect crime. The thing I steal is going to give me rock and

14:39.840 --> 14:45.280
rea. It's the perfect crime next door neighbor. I don't see why you had to come out naked with

14:45.280 --> 14:50.320
a tail tape to you and dark circles drawn around your eyes. That seems like a lot of verisimilitude,

14:50.320 --> 14:55.600
a lot more than I needed. Just next time, just ask and I'll like give you the old ass,

14:55.600 --> 15:02.400
give you the old old candy. Yeah. Guys, this Yahoo answer was sent by Emily Wall. Thank you, Emily.

15:02.400 --> 15:12.080
It's by Yahoo answers user Kaya who asks, does Ryan Gosling party? So I guess this is kind of

15:12.080 --> 15:17.120
a complicated question because there are a lot of different angles here. Like does he like to party

15:17.120 --> 15:23.440
and is down for whatever? Or does he just, or does he just do something like smoke weed slash cocaine

15:23.440 --> 15:30.720
or maybe just smoke weed when he's tired? Please only answer if you really know. Oh my God.

15:30.720 --> 15:37.360
First response from Ryan Gosling. Yeah, I'm down for whatever. Hey girl, let me get those digits.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.360
I'm high right now. Why do you ask?

15:43.360 --> 15:50.160
I, um, I have to imagine that Mr. Gosling can party. He probably, I think he has the capacity

15:50.160 --> 15:54.640
to party whether he chooses to or not is the question. I bet he's really straight edge

15:54.640 --> 15:59.920
actually. Now that I think about it, he's got to stay fit. He was in a half Nelson and he was

15:59.920 --> 16:05.680
played a drug addict teacher and I think he saw that and I bet he was like when he got into the

16:05.680 --> 16:11.200
role and he got out of it, he was like, I can't, I can't mess with that shit anymore. You know,

16:11.200 --> 16:17.440
that's beneath me. Yeah. I bet he goes to parties like parties that are way below him on the social

16:17.440 --> 16:22.800
level just to like bring them up a notch, you know? And I bet he just stays for like 10 minutes.

16:22.800 --> 16:28.320
Doesn't, doesn't drink total straight edge. Think of this baller move, right? Ryan Gosling

16:28.320 --> 16:33.440
walks into like your fucking high school graduation party where you've all stolen beer

16:33.440 --> 16:36.640
from your dad's liquor cabinet or whatever. And Ryan Gosling just walks in and everybody goes,

16:36.640 --> 16:40.000
Oh my God, is that Ryan Gosling? And he just looks around and goes, Oh, I can't believe

16:40.000 --> 16:45.760
you guys are drinking. It's totally not cool. Straight edge for life. And then he leaves.

16:45.760 --> 16:53.520
And after that, what are we doing? Yeah. I, uh, I have, I've recently learned by recently,

16:53.520 --> 17:00.000
I mean the past minute and a half. Um, I don't think party means what it did when I was younger.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.440
In my day, if somebody said a party, the only requirements were a, somebody turned up the jock

17:05.440 --> 17:10.560
jam CD really loud. And B, the invitation said till question mark. Those are the two ingredients

17:10.560 --> 17:14.720
for a party. I don't think that that's what this person is talking about. Now, once you turn the

17:14.720 --> 17:19.360
jock jams up really loud, crank them. I mean, crank those jocks. Once you crank the jocks,

17:19.360 --> 17:24.960
like what's the next step there? Because I'm envisioning you at a party that you're hosting,

17:25.520 --> 17:31.360
you put in the jock jam CD, which volume, uh, jock jams volume for the one that, uh, has the,

17:31.920 --> 17:38.640
we will rock you. We are the champions. Oh, slam a jam and ding dong. I imagine that the next step

17:38.640 --> 17:43.920
Griffin is to open the front door and wait for people to arrive. It's basically like every party

17:43.920 --> 17:51.360
you had before you, before alcohol, where you have 20 kids in a basement, jock jams going,

17:51.360 --> 17:57.520
jock jams going fucking eating pizza and then everybody looks at each other and everybody looks

17:57.520 --> 18:01.760
at each other and says, I thought this was supposed to be fun. I don't get it. I've seen

18:01.760 --> 18:06.720
my parents doing this for years. How are they making it so enjoyable? I don't understand.

18:06.720 --> 18:14.080
Let's leave it 10. Um, so what does partying mean now? I think it's like doing drugs.

18:14.640 --> 18:21.520
It's like drugs and that's not partying. That's falling asleep. Oh man. Travy. You are old.

18:22.080 --> 18:29.440
I am old. It's like fun drugs. It's like party drugs and then you do them and then like sometimes

18:29.440 --> 18:35.200
you rub up against someone. It's, I don't fully comprehend it either, but I've watched a lot of

18:35.200 --> 18:43.360
party of five. What, what kind of fun drugs? Oh, you know, like uppers and downers and perkeys and

18:43.360 --> 18:48.240
xana. I would say almost by just by the meaning of the word, I don't think downers are fun drugs.

18:49.040 --> 18:54.000
You take them with uppers and then you, you're just kind of normal. Okay. It's not a good way

18:54.000 --> 19:06.080
to spend your money. Shroomers, dippers, uh, leaves, uh, sweet dust, uh, uh, lady fingers.

19:07.600 --> 19:15.040
That's not a real one. Uh, power, power powder, uh, gummy vitamins. Uh huh. Special lemonade,

19:15.040 --> 19:26.480
uh, regular lemonade, uh, ring pop dipped in cocaine, uh, needles, uh, bag, baggies, dimers,

19:27.280 --> 19:36.240
uh, and that's all the drugs that there are. Big 25 H. H. H. I had a fun experience with Ryan

19:36.240 --> 19:41.920
Gosling this week. I was playing the, uh, this is a brief diversion into video games, but I promise

19:41.920 --> 19:49.360
it's worth it. Uh, I was playing the beta of the new dungeon crawler torchlight two and, uh, you

19:49.360 --> 19:54.480
can only play that online. So I, I went into some strangers, uh, I had to pick some stranger's game

19:54.480 --> 20:02.000
to join, uh, so I myself could play by myself. Uh, and the game I joined was hosted by Ryan Gosling

20:02.000 --> 20:06.080
was this gentleman. It was this gentleman's username was Ryan Gosling. So I said, okay,

20:06.080 --> 20:12.720
that looks like a good game to join as any. So Ryan Gosling joins and he finds me,

20:12.720 --> 20:17.840
he tracks me down in his game world and introduces himself as Ryan Gosling. I say,

20:17.840 --> 20:24.560
okay, hello, pleasure. Uh, and then he and I proceed to adventure around for a while.

20:24.560 --> 20:31.280
And after every, we fought a large enemy, he would always compare it to a scene in a movie.

20:31.280 --> 20:39.920
And it's literally like at, we would be like a, a large, uh, giant boss. And he would say,

20:39.920 --> 20:43.840
God, look at this place. This reminds me of after I stomped on that guy's face and dry.

20:44.880 --> 20:48.640
Now, Justin, I'm sure you've already thought about this, but is it possible

20:49.600 --> 20:53.360
that that was Ryan Gosling? It was definitely Ryan Gosling.

20:53.360 --> 20:57.520
I mean, it's definitely Ryan Gosling. The only thing that made hurt his credibility a little bit

20:57.520 --> 21:05.840
it was that he introduced me to his ferret named Zac Efron. And it occurred to me then

21:05.840 --> 21:13.280
that if he could name a ferret Zac Efron, then maybe somebody else could name a character Ryan

21:13.280 --> 21:18.800
Gosling that wasn't Ryan Gosling. So that, that's what, that's what kind of ruined the illusion for

21:18.800 --> 21:26.960
me. Um, I bet that's what Ryan Gosling does with his time is he just plays online,

21:26.960 --> 21:32.320
online dungeon caller role playing games and just like eats Xannies and does needles.

21:35.600 --> 21:41.120
Hey, the HM is real hard. My friends and I are planning to go to a karaoke bar in the

21:41.120 --> 21:45.280
near future. I want to participate and avoid being that guy who sits in the back refusing

21:45.280 --> 21:49.760
to have any fun. There's a girl I like who's coming as well. So I wanted to know what song

21:49.760 --> 21:58.480
we best to, and this is in quotes, sing. I love this metric. I have, go for it. I have a higher

21:58.480 --> 22:07.760
voice, similar, but not nearly as good as Jason Mraz. If that helps. It doesn't. That's from

22:07.760 --> 22:14.560
thunder waffle. Okay. First step, never compare yourself to Jason Mraz ever. Second, you gotta,

22:14.560 --> 22:18.400
you gotta get a new karaoke name. I don't think thunder waffle is going to take you.

22:18.400 --> 22:25.440
That's into step one that I can, that I can tell you, uh, get a, get a karaoke, uh,

22:26.640 --> 22:34.640
nom de nom de nom de Mike. Uh, it's Justin. What was your karaoke name? My karaoke name

22:35.520 --> 22:42.880
has been for the past decade and is still plenty back. What was yours? Uh, Jeff Pepsi

22:42.880 --> 22:48.800
and mine was encyclopedia Brown. You gotta get a handle for your, for your, uh, for your

22:48.800 --> 22:54.160
performing performance. Cause that allows you some distance. It lets you, when I inhabit the

22:54.160 --> 23:00.320
character of plenty pack, then I know it's a, it's a role that I'm playing. I, I, I'm

23:00.320 --> 23:06.800
more in touch with the music now as far as song choice. I can help out there. Yeah. What you don't

23:06.800 --> 23:12.480
want to do is go for what you think is the funny choice, right? Because you've got those guys who

23:12.480 --> 23:18.480
get up and do, I would do anything for love, but they can't sing. And it's a really hard song to do.

23:18.480 --> 23:23.040
Yeah. There's a lot of, there's a lot of wrong things you can do when you're picking a karaoke

23:23.040 --> 23:26.560
song. Like you can pick a song that you think is going to be funny. You can pick a song that you

23:26.560 --> 23:33.040
really like. Oh man. That's just going to be the worst for you. Like I did a bird house in your

23:33.040 --> 23:36.320
soul at a karaoke place once. I was like, Oh, that's like the best song that's ever been written

23:36.320 --> 23:43.920
by anyone. Not a good karaoke song. The best karaoke choice I think is the song that is the

23:43.920 --> 23:52.880
song that you would claim to like ironically, but you actually deep, deep down like it. It's

23:52.880 --> 23:58.240
going to seem like an ironic pick, like you're picking it as a goof, but it actually is pretty

23:58.240 --> 24:04.800
kick ass. Here's an example. Um, get out, get out of my dreams, get into my car. Oh, that's a good

24:04.800 --> 24:09.520
one. That's a good one. We're like, that's all right. That seems like a funny choice, but man,

24:09.520 --> 24:15.200
you get that four on the floor. Everybody's into it. You know, everybody's with you all night long

24:15.200 --> 24:20.000
by Lionel Richie. Yeah. See, that's a good, that's a good jam. I like that. Oh man. We're just

24:20.000 --> 24:25.280
doing Rocky horror. All the, all the bait he can handle for literally any Michael McDonald,

24:25.920 --> 24:34.400
Michael McDonald, like it's going to sound good no matter what. And it's also important.

24:34.400 --> 24:38.240
Don't pick anything. That's a bummer. Like I know that that's pretty obvious,

24:38.240 --> 24:41.760
but you get those people to get up there and they're performing for themselves and they're

24:41.760 --> 24:46.400
ignoring the fact that it's like a bar full of people. And suddenly the whole evening drops down

24:46.400 --> 24:52.880
to like a candlelit. They decide everybody hurts and now, and they're going to inflict it on,

24:53.600 --> 24:59.920
on you. Um, this is with the song, everybody. Yeah. Exactly. Uh, I would caution you,

24:59.920 --> 25:06.800
you pick a song that you know, the words for cold, like you have to know every word to it.

25:06.800 --> 25:11.840
You do not, you cannot rely on the screen because it might, it might fritz out. You might get

25:11.840 --> 25:17.200
distracted. The words might have the wrong words on it. Yeah. That's bad. And you also don't want

25:17.200 --> 25:21.680
to be like glued to the screen the whole time. You want to be able to kind of like do it. And

25:21.680 --> 25:26.320
in this world, there's smartphones that connect to YouTube. There's no reason not to like put in

25:26.320 --> 25:32.240
song and then hop on YouTube and refresh the words in your head. So like, you know the song before

25:32.240 --> 25:36.160
you get out there. Cause I also guarantee that the first like 10 songs you're going to pick in your

25:36.160 --> 25:41.920
head have one moment in them that has a string of notes you can't hit. You know what I mean? That's

25:41.920 --> 25:46.000
the thing. You can't, you gotta look at the song as a whole and not be like, okay, I really know

25:46.000 --> 25:49.680
the chorus and I can do that. And don't be afraid to just like stop singing and say, is everybody

25:49.680 --> 25:54.800
having a good time tonight? Yeah. Cause that usually works. And have a, have like a pocket

25:54.800 --> 25:58.480
full of candy, like jolly ranchers that you can just like throw into the audience. And if you can

25:58.480 --> 26:03.920
get one guy to stand behind you and pretend to play an inflatable sax, I think that really

26:03.920 --> 26:08.000
ratchets up the level. And then find the appropriate moment to take your shirt off.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.960
And I find that the audience just loves that. And then pull out your, your, uh, your wreck

26:12.960 --> 26:18.560
penis and just like hit it against the microphone a few times. Yeah. That's how you win, win at

26:18.560 --> 26:25.280
karaoke, karaoke, the ancient art of embarrassing yourself. Um, that's the other thing. I'm really

26:25.280 --> 26:30.080
glad that you realize the fact that you don't want to be the guy that doesn't participate.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.360
Cause that's, that's one of the most frustrating things for me when people go to karaoke and

26:33.360 --> 26:37.840
they're like, I don't know, I don't really do it. I'm like, do you see those people up there? Like,

26:37.840 --> 26:43.040
no one's up there winning American Idol. It is tantamount to sitting at the end of the pool.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.680
Uh, like while everybody else swims at the pool party, like nobody's going to remember

26:47.680 --> 26:51.360
if you get up there and do a shitty job. Everybody's going to remember if you,

26:52.160 --> 26:57.040
if you don't do it. Yeah. In fact, I like people to get up and do shitty jobs more

26:57.040 --> 27:00.640
because at least they don't fucking care. At least they're just doing it to participate.

27:00.640 --> 27:05.120
I love that. And read the crowd too, because sometimes you might just want to punish them.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.640
Sometimes you just might just want to make them pay for some of the songs you've been subjected

27:08.640 --> 27:12.560
to. You got to remember it's not about you, even though everybody does sing karaoke because they

27:12.560 --> 27:18.160
like attention. Um, the only way you're going to get it is if you're, is if you're wanting the party

27:18.160 --> 27:21.840
to start, you want- I think that's unfair. That's an unfair assumption to make about everybody,

27:21.840 --> 27:26.720
Justin. Cause when I say, like when I, when I sing karaoke, it's because I want to give,

27:26.720 --> 27:31.840
like, I want to give my gift. Sure. Right. It's like, I want to share my gift to the,

27:31.840 --> 27:36.400
with the world, you know? Right. Your self-absorption has gotten to such a,

27:36.400 --> 27:39.920
a terminal case of it that you have to give it away. You have to give it away.

27:39.920 --> 27:46.000
I, I know they want it. Your viral, your viral load.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.480
I know they want it. I got it to give.

27:49.920 --> 27:54.800
You have such a viral load of self-confidence that one compliment sends it spreading

27:54.800 --> 27:59.200
a pandemic like to every surrounding country. I just blow it.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.960
You know what makes my heart want to sing? Nope. Money.

28:04.960 --> 28:19.440
Ah, beautiful. Let's get out of the money zone.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.200
Griffin? Yeah?

28:21.200 --> 28:25.280
Have I told you about the Aldis project? You haven't told me anything about anything.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.720
I taught you. That's not true. I've taught you so much.

28:28.720 --> 28:33.040
You taught me about the pro- you're, you told me about this one time you were talking about

28:33.040 --> 28:36.400
hunting down the entire family of Alan Alda. Yeah.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.000
Is that what, is that what you're referring to? No, that isn't the Aldis project.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.280
It's close. The Aldis project is 366 drawings for good.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.480
It's a year-long project by an artist named Christie Moderelli.

28:47.200 --> 28:52.400
It's two-fold. One, it's a personal challenge to create 366 original drawings in as many days.

28:52.400 --> 28:56.320
And she also is raising money for three of her favorite nonprofits.

28:57.040 --> 29:02.640
826 International, the Cherokee Foundation. It's just 826 National. They don't, they don't give

29:02.640 --> 29:07.280
a, they don't give a fuck about other countries. 826 National, the Cherokee

29:07.280 --> 29:10.880
Foundat- I'm taking a shot in the dark pronunciation right here.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.440
Shoerake. Shoerake Foundation,

29:13.440 --> 29:18.000
and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Said all those words, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:23.040
They look out for sea sheep, of course. Each original drawing can be sold for $100

29:24.320 --> 29:28.080
with $25 going to the buyer's choice of the three charities, and there are no additional

29:28.080 --> 29:31.040
fees of any kind, including shipping. Well, that sounds awesome.

29:31.040 --> 29:35.200
That sounds, that's going to bring in a big buy. 366 drawings a day. That's

29:35.760 --> 29:38.480
one drawing every day for the year. Yeah.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.360
I see one- And where can people go to,

29:41.360 --> 29:46.960
to learn more about it, Juice? It's the Aldi, it's thealdisproject.com.

29:46.960 --> 29:53.920
You know, the A-L-D-A-S project.com to learn more and buy one of these paintings.

29:53.920 --> 29:58.720
And I would suggest you do because they look really cool. One looks like a bunch of bacon

29:58.720 --> 30:03.360
held up by sticks, so I love it. I love this painting.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.160
Like a bacon fort? I never get art,

30:06.160 --> 30:11.120
and finally someone made a bacon fort and I'm there. I'm in it.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.720
I'm into it. You're in the bacon fort?

30:12.720 --> 30:17.920
I'm living in the bacon fort. Sometimes when I put my penis in a cage,

30:18.960 --> 30:23.600
I refer to the cage as a bacon fort. Wait a minute, your penis in a cage?

30:23.600 --> 30:27.280
Where do you find penis cages at this time of year?

30:27.280 --> 30:33.600
Well, I used to try to make them, not gonna lie, but that's very difficult.

30:34.240 --> 30:38.560
It's hard to do, welding, blacksmithing. I just leave it to the trained

30:38.560 --> 30:42.960
professional experts at Extreme Restraints. Extremerestraints.com?

30:44.560 --> 30:50.320
You know what, I've been thinking I should go there because my butt plug doesn't stretch my

30:50.320 --> 30:55.360
anus in a way that's pleasurable to me anymore. At this point, you've already done all the

30:55.360 --> 30:57.680
stretching you're gonna do. Your gauge is too high now.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.120
You gotta keep upgrading. I have to keep upgrading

31:01.120 --> 31:06.000
to get that pleasurable spread that I enjoy. The main problem I had when I went to

31:06.000 --> 31:11.120
Extremerestraints.com is that everything seemed to be 20% out of my price range.

31:11.760 --> 31:18.000
I'm so glad you brought that up, Justin, because I can offer you and our listeners a deal that

31:18.000 --> 31:22.800
for this week and any time that we mention Extreme Restraints on the show,

31:22.800 --> 31:29.600
we can give you a 20% off coupon code, and it's just MIDDLEST, M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T, MIDDLEST,

31:29.600 --> 31:34.320
and you get 20% off. And even on the weeks when we don't talk about Extreme Restraints,

31:34.320 --> 31:38.480
if you use the coupon code MIDDLEST, you still get 10% off your entire order.

31:38.480 --> 31:44.000
It's a great coupon, and listen, your sex life is boring, whether you know it or not,

31:44.000 --> 31:50.800
unless you have already bought electrodes and lube and a glory hole? Is that a thing?

31:50.800 --> 31:56.960
I don't know if you can buy a glory hole. I think you just find one in nature.

31:58.160 --> 32:03.920
You're gay now. That's going to take up a lot. You're federally gay. You're going to need a whole

32:03.920 --> 32:10.400
new flotilla of sex toys. I guess. Yeah, definitely. You can't use your old stuff.

32:12.560 --> 32:17.760
I don't know the utility of a pocket vagina. What do you mean, utility?

32:17.760 --> 32:22.000
We got a lot of complaints last week because I said pocket and then the p-word that people use

32:22.000 --> 32:26.240
sometimes to describe vaginas. But I think that's like the clinical name, right? That is the name

32:26.240 --> 32:31.600
of the product. Well, not going to say it anymore because it's not that it's dirty or wrong,

32:31.600 --> 32:37.600
but that I apparently have like a child's intonation, and it just takes people the wrong

32:37.600 --> 32:42.960
way. When you say it, it's great intonation. Do yourself a favor and go check it out,

32:42.960 --> 32:47.200
and it might surprise you, even if you wouldn't consider it to be your kind of thing,

32:47.200 --> 32:51.440
I think it would surprise you the kind of things that they have there. What's the URL again?

32:51.440 --> 32:55.760
It's ExtremeRestraints.com, and make sure to use the coupon code MEDALIST to get 20%

32:55.760 --> 32:58.160
off your order. Don't go to ExtremeRestraints.gov.

33:01.840 --> 33:07.360
They make you go to Guantanamo. It's terrible. It's a terrible website. You know what's not

33:07.360 --> 33:12.800
terrible, though? What's that? Vigia games. Love them. Travis, have you heard of any cool ones?

33:12.800 --> 33:18.880
I have. There's a new project from the guys at Mob Rules Games. They're working on Haunts the

33:18.880 --> 33:23.520
Manse Macabre, and we talked about it last week, and since then, you guys have been doing so good

33:23.520 --> 33:28.960
donating to their Kickstarter. Basically, they're looking for $25,000 to help finish their game so

33:28.960 --> 33:38.000
they can get it released by October, and it's a turn-based adventure game, and the art style is

33:38.000 --> 33:45.520
like Edward Gorey, Edgar Allen Poe-ish. It's awesome, and it's just an open-source, independent

33:45.520 --> 33:50.480
gaming thing. It's amazing, and the guys there are super cool, super great. Go check out their

33:50.480 --> 33:59.360
Kickstarter. What is the Kickstarter at right now? It is $7,876. Okay, not bad. We gotta pick up the

33:59.360 --> 34:05.760
pace, though. Yeah, we gotta step it up. There's some time left to donate, so it's not too late,

34:05.760 --> 34:10.320
and make sure if you do donate, make sure in the comments you tell them that NBNBAM sent you,

34:10.320 --> 34:15.760
because that way they know that they have us to thank. You know, that it's all on us,

34:15.760 --> 34:22.560
because we're awesome. I always get to this point where I want a highest level of pledge

34:22.560 --> 34:28.160
where they have to name the game after me. How high do you think, though? I think if you gave all

34:28.160 --> 34:32.000
$25,000, you could probably make that happen. Yeah, I don't want it to be Haunts. I want it

34:32.000 --> 34:37.440
to be Justin McElroy's Haunts. Justin McElroy Presents. Maybe not so much like a turn-based

34:37.440 --> 34:42.480
adventure horror game, but like a platformer starring you. Yeah, right. And you gotta collect

34:42.480 --> 34:47.840
all the candy. This is called It's Justin. It's Justin, the game. The Skittles Adventure.

34:48.400 --> 34:55.760
Where is my NBNBAM iOS game? Why is no one developing that? Come on. You just

34:55.760 --> 35:03.760
invented it just now. Somebody kickstarted it or something. That's at mobrulesgames.com,

35:03.760 --> 35:08.960
right? And the donations on that Kickstarter start as low as $5. And for $5 you get a copy

35:08.960 --> 35:15.120
of the game when it's done. It's a great deal. Yeah, and that's the low end. If you kick it up

35:15.120 --> 35:20.640
to like $25, you can get your name in the credits. Is your name in the credits anything else? No,

35:20.640 --> 35:24.320
it's not. You haven't accomplished anything. This is your chance to accomplish something

35:24.320 --> 35:30.000
with your life. This is your big shot. Fuck up. So go on, you fuck up. Go to mobrulesgames.com

35:30.000 --> 35:33.440
and see a link to the Kickstarter and just click it and fund it already. God,

35:33.440 --> 35:37.280
make your parents proud of you for the first time ever. For the first time in history. Piece of

35:37.280 --> 35:45.280
shit. You're such a disappointment. Somebody once told me your art is kind of old and boring.

35:45.280 --> 35:56.160
You got to get some new art. Your art's got a shelf life of about 24 hours. So you better

35:56.160 --> 36:08.080
replace that art with new art. You can go to thealdisproject.com and buy a drawing every

36:08.080 --> 36:17.200
single day. That's thealdisproject.com. Send some money her way.

36:24.640 --> 36:30.000
Hello there. My name is Graham Clark. And I'm Dave Shumka. And together we host a podcast called

36:30.000 --> 36:35.200
Stop Podcasting Yourself. This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to

36:35.200 --> 36:40.080
it in your pod. What's that about, you ask? Well, who are you to ask? Who do you think you are?

36:40.080 --> 36:45.680
Yeah, get lost, bozo. We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia,

36:45.680 --> 36:50.400
Canada. And every week we bring a guest on the show. Sometimes they're Canadian,

36:50.400 --> 36:55.200
sometimes they're not. Sometimes they're a ghost. It's like you're sitting in on a friendly

36:55.200 --> 37:02.800
afternoon chat. Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break. You can find us on iTunes or online

37:02.800 --> 37:13.280
at maximumfun.org. I just finished my junior year of college. My spring semester would have been

37:13.280 --> 37:20.400
satisfactory. A's and B's were not for a miserable D. Getting a D is depressing.

37:21.360 --> 37:27.040
At least your spelling's on point. For many reasons. I've never gotten below a C in a class

37:27.040 --> 37:31.680
and now I have to break the news to my parents who are generously paying for my college education.

37:31.680 --> 37:35.600
How do I tell my parents and how do I bounce back from this academic misstep? And that's

37:35.600 --> 37:40.320
from a dumb person. That's my, it says quote, that's my new name for myself.

37:40.320 --> 37:45.360
All right, stop right there. That's what you got to stop doing. First of all,

37:45.920 --> 37:50.240
everybody gets D's from time to time. I got a D in home economics in middle school.

37:50.240 --> 37:56.080
I got a D in earthquakes and volcanoes. Yeah. Cause you know why? Cause I don't give a shit

37:56.080 --> 38:01.200
about, we had to make nachos and I did a bad job. Hey, there's a D. You made bad nachos?

38:01.200 --> 38:04.880
I'm not an idiot. I just made a, I made a fucking nachos mistake.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.640
You know, I disagree, Griffin. I think if you can't nail down nachos.

38:08.640 --> 38:14.400
It was my first time taking a stab at nachos. So like, sorry, we can't all be like fucking

38:15.200 --> 38:18.960
nachos geniuses. It's like nacho leeway.

38:18.960 --> 38:24.720
Nachos idiot savants. Like it takes some time to ramp up to nachos. Anyway,

38:24.720 --> 38:28.560
you fucked up, but guess what? You're not a dummy. Right.

38:28.560 --> 38:32.000
Cause you got, you get good grades all the time. If you got bad grades all the time,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.400
then you'd probably be a dummy. Hear that bad grade people.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.880
Let me fill this out. Maybe don't tell your parents.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.120
They got to, they're going to send them a report card.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.720
They don't send report cards in college.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.000
I'm pretty sure they don't do that.

38:44.960 --> 38:48.480
They do. Yeah, they would. They do. They'll send a, they'll send a note if you're,

38:49.520 --> 38:53.040
if you're failing for sure. But you're not failing. You got a D.

38:53.040 --> 38:56.480
Yeah. Maybe, maybe you're cool. Just go to your parents and say,

38:56.480 --> 39:00.560
Hey, fucked up my nachos. Don't worry about it. I'm an adult now.

39:00.560 --> 39:05.120
Look at my brother, Kevin. You guys messed that one up. He's a jerk. I hate his guts.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.440
So what? I got bad geometry. Let's not make this about Kevin.

39:09.440 --> 39:12.000
You're right. All right. Everything's always about Kevin.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.200
I, at my school, when I was in college, in my major,

39:17.920 --> 39:22.400
there was some rule. Like if you got below a C in a major's course, you had to take it over,

39:22.400 --> 39:27.600
which always frustrated me as to why they even offered grades below a C. If that was the case,

39:27.600 --> 39:31.120
it might not just fail. It should just be A, B, C, and then nope.

39:31.120 --> 39:36.960
And then do it again. But like, if you're talking a gen ed course and like you got like a D in

39:36.960 --> 39:40.720
chemistry, great. You're never going to use that in your philosophy degree.

39:40.720 --> 39:46.160
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry guys. I use like one fifth of the things I learned in college.

39:46.720 --> 39:50.960
Yeah. And most of it's like how to roll a, a doobie.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.360
You know, just how to do some ageums.

39:53.360 --> 40:00.720
I was at, um, I, I was at Starbucks the other day and I got a, you know, a Venti drip and they're

40:00.720 --> 40:07.840
like, that's, that's $3.62. And I had a $5 bill in my wallet and I gave them the $5 bill. And then

40:07.840 --> 40:12.160
they use their register to figure out the exact change. And then they gave it back to me. No

40:12.160 --> 40:17.280
maths involved. All I needed to know was my coffee preferences.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.720
One further. In college, I had to take a botany class.

40:20.720 --> 40:21.280
Cool.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.360
Like in what way am I using that now?

40:23.360 --> 40:24.560
That would actually be handy.

40:24.560 --> 40:27.840
That would be handy. I'd like to be able to identify some of the plant life around me.

40:27.840 --> 40:31.040
You know what I can do now? I can be like, that's a tree versus a bush.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.480
And that over there, that's a flower.

40:33.040 --> 40:36.640
That's the, that's your, those are your three metrics depending on the size of the arbor.

40:37.440 --> 40:37.600
Right.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.600
No, that was pretty big. I'm almost certain that's a tree.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.680
Gonna go with tree. Oh, it's a house?

40:41.680 --> 40:42.480
Fuck.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.840
Shit. Damn it. It was big though.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.240
I didn't take house-ery in college.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.240
It was big and it had green on it.

40:48.240 --> 40:52.480
Um, there's no such thing as a permanent record and your D doesn't matter for shit.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.560
You'll never go into a job interview and they'll be like,

40:54.560 --> 40:57.200
well, you're totally qualified and it looks like you have excellent references.

40:57.840 --> 41:02.160
Oh, it looks like you got a D in home economics because you made bad nachos.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.480
We're going to have to just, we're going to pass.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.600
To what point, to what age in your guy's life did you,

41:08.960 --> 41:15.680
did you operate under the assumption that somewhere there was a manila folder with your

41:15.680 --> 41:20.080
name written on it that just, they transferred from school to school,

41:20.800 --> 41:23.360
following you around for your entire life?

41:23.360 --> 41:28.320
I gave up on that junior year because I went into the office and I needed something from

41:28.320 --> 41:32.880
like a high school AP course and they couldn't find that information.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.320
And I was like, you sons of bitches.

41:35.120 --> 41:35.760
You don't know me.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.200
You don't know shit.

41:37.200 --> 41:40.320
You're not tracking anything I do.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.800
So since then I've left no paper trail.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.240
You can just feel off the grid.

41:44.240 --> 41:48.880
I'm off the grid, I've been so careful until this show and that's how the mafia found me.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.440
Coming out this summer, the Charles McElroy story.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.160
It's boring.

41:52.720 --> 41:53.600
It's real bad.

41:54.640 --> 41:58.640
It's about how I owed $30 to the college library and they wouldn't send me my diploma.

41:59.280 --> 41:59.840
That's true.

42:01.840 --> 42:02.960
It seriously doesn't matter.

42:02.960 --> 42:08.000
And like, there's a reverse side of this where if you bust your ass getting like straight A's,

42:08.000 --> 42:12.160
like I worked really hard in college and I graduated cumload and like,

42:12.160 --> 42:15.280
I like to this day.

42:15.280 --> 42:19.200
Do you know how many like Benny's that's gotten me post-grad?

42:20.000 --> 42:21.120
Zilch, Zippo.

42:22.400 --> 42:26.240
As long as you come away with the knowledge, it doesn't matter how well you test on it.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.520
As long as you pass the class and know your shit, that's all that matters.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.080
Yeah.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.040
You know what I mean?

42:31.040 --> 42:34.720
There's a reason why in the hit Tim McGraw song, Move Like You're Dying,

42:34.720 --> 42:37.760
he doesn't say skydiving, Rocky Mountain climbing,

42:38.320 --> 42:41.840
study my algebra until I did real good at it.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.200
And then there's that verse where he's like,

42:43.200 --> 42:47.680
I burned up all of my books except for my Bible today.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.760
Jesus, take the wheel.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.000
That's a good karaoke song.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.920
Take all of my books.

43:00.640 --> 43:04.160
I can't read the road signs, Jesus.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.400
I didn't learn.

43:06.400 --> 43:11.840
Learn, teach me how to add.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.920
Jesus, balance my checkbook.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.040
Adding and subtracting escapes me.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.480
I don't know how much to tip, Jesus.

43:20.480 --> 43:23.680
I still don't know what taxes are.

43:25.440 --> 43:29.200
Guys, this Yahoo answer is sent in by Kristen McMurt-

43:29.200 --> 43:30.000
Oh shit.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Kristen McMurtry.

43:32.000 --> 43:32.320
Okay.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.520
Thank you, Kristen.

43:33.520 --> 43:34.800
Maybe work on that last name.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Maria who asks,

43:37.680 --> 43:39.760
how loud is prom music?

43:39.760 --> 43:41.520
How to prevent ears from damage?

43:42.800 --> 43:46.800
This may sound weird, but I hate loud music and I am scared of it damaging my ears.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.560
I have prom next week and I don't want to be the weird one with big ear protectors on.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.160
I have never been to a prom before.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.280
Wait, what?

43:55.280 --> 43:56.880
I have never been to a prom before,

43:56.880 --> 44:01.680
so I was just wondering if they play the music really loud and if so, how to protect my ears.

44:01.680 --> 44:05.920
Okay. Madam, I have known you for all of one question.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.200
The ship has sailed on being the weird one.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.680
Like you, that has passed you by.

44:14.880 --> 44:26.000
Have you guys ever listened to T-Pain or T-I or I-Pain at a reasonable level of volume?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.720
Like a smooth jazz undercurrent level.

44:28.720 --> 44:36.080
Yeah, like quiet car radio, you know, taking a bubble bath with your iPhone speakers.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.680
Like that level of sound?

44:38.400 --> 44:39.600
No, you can't.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.960
It's nigh-unlistenable.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.880
Your ears actually cannot detect it.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.120
It's like a dog whistle.

44:46.400 --> 44:51.840
And I guarantee that if I went there now, I'd think the music was really loud because I am old.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.280
Oh yeah, you're really old.

44:53.920 --> 44:57.920
What if you did just wear big headphones

44:57.920 --> 45:01.200
and you were listening to your own music and dancing to that?

45:02.400 --> 45:04.640
You just could call me maybe on repeat.

45:04.640 --> 45:07.600
Oh, that sounds like my dream world.

45:07.600 --> 45:07.920
Fuck.

45:07.920 --> 45:08.720
I know, right?

45:08.720 --> 45:09.360
So good.

45:09.360 --> 45:12.480
Pop in your skull candy and just listen away.

45:12.480 --> 45:16.320
Let Carly Rae Jessup just take you off to dream town.

45:17.360 --> 45:19.920
I'm going with you, Carly Rae Jessup.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.280
Fly me to the moon.

45:21.280 --> 45:24.720
Can you be the person at the prom who goes up to the DJ and is like,

45:24.720 --> 45:28.320
hey, can you maybe turn it down just a little bit?

45:28.320 --> 45:30.000
Would you play like some Chicago?

45:30.000 --> 45:31.600
Something just like a little easier.

45:31.600 --> 45:33.360
It's not an unreasonable fear.

45:34.400 --> 45:39.280
Your ears are like tiny little rings with like a thin layer of saran wrap.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.200
And if that saran wrap breaks, guess what?

45:41.200 --> 45:41.840
You're deaf.

45:43.120 --> 45:44.000
You can't hear anymore.

45:44.000 --> 45:44.720
That's how that works.

45:45.680 --> 45:49.920
I'm a little more worried about the pregnancy.

45:49.920 --> 45:53.840
Like there's so many more dangers at prom to be concerned about.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.920
You're worried about ear babies.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.280
No, no.

45:58.720 --> 46:03.200
Despite what Arnani told us growing up, rock music doesn't make your ears pregnant.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.120
What I'm worried about, yeah, I know.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.600
What I'm worried about is the underage sex.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.320
Yeah.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.760
There's sex at prom?

46:11.600 --> 46:12.560
Is that where it's happening?

46:14.400 --> 46:20.560
I mean, the grinding was pretty hot and heavy in 2005.

46:22.720 --> 46:23.360
Sorry, everyone.

46:23.360 --> 46:23.920
I'm a baby.

46:26.880 --> 46:30.160
I can only imagine how things have escalated because they've escalated

46:30.160 --> 46:32.000
in literally every other way.

46:32.000 --> 46:39.120
And if the grinding was like super, super gnar when I was 18, like now that I'm 25,

46:40.720 --> 46:44.720
I bet you people are just like getting their dicks dirty right there on the floor.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.560
And side note, this is a weird transition,

46:46.560 --> 46:49.280
but I can only imagine there's another good karaoke song.

46:49.280 --> 46:53.920
Where did that come from?

46:54.560 --> 46:59.440
You're literally the worst person of all people.

46:59.440 --> 47:00.240
You are the worst.

47:00.880 --> 47:05.200
I can only imagine how to read.

47:09.520 --> 47:14.320
I can only imagine where Mexico is.

47:14.320 --> 47:21.360
I can only imagine how many branches of the government there are.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.400
Joke's on you.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.520
There's only one.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.320
It's Jesus.

47:27.600 --> 47:28.560
He's got the wheel.

47:28.560 --> 47:29.200
He's my judge.

47:29.200 --> 47:33.040
I used to have it before Barack Hussein Obama yanked it out of his hands

47:33.040 --> 47:35.440
and started steering his own ship.

47:36.240 --> 47:42.560
He's my Supreme Court justice, majority whip, and president and commander in chief.

47:42.560 --> 47:45.440
And my king forever.

47:47.280 --> 47:53.920
This Yahoo was sent in by Liana, which was sent to her by her friend Keith.

47:53.920 --> 47:56.160
So thank you both people in this arrangement.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.360
For the second hand Yahoo.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.200
Many, many Bothans died to bring us this Yahoo.

48:01.200 --> 48:02.240
So let's really enjoy it.

48:02.240 --> 48:06.080
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user Geof who asks,

48:07.440 --> 48:10.320
is it okay to draw on a dog with magic marker?

48:10.320 --> 48:16.560
Sometimes when my stepdad Ron grounds me, I'll write messages on my dog.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.680
He is white with washable marker and send him downstairs.

48:20.400 --> 48:24.960
Just little messages, like if I need food or about how much I hate my stepdad Ron.

48:26.960 --> 48:28.800
My mom said it would make the dog sick.

48:28.800 --> 48:29.520
Is she right?

48:33.200 --> 48:36.800
So many more problems with the best stepdad name ever is Ron.

48:37.840 --> 48:38.800
Got some dog mail.

48:38.800 --> 48:41.120
Got some dog mail for you, Ron.

48:41.120 --> 48:41.840
Fuck off.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.360
I hate you, Ron.

48:45.360 --> 48:46.560
I hate you so much.

48:46.560 --> 48:47.600
Come here, Mr. Perkins.

48:48.320 --> 48:48.800
What's it?

48:49.680 --> 48:50.320
Oh, man.

48:51.520 --> 48:53.120
It really helps my, that hurts my self esteem.

48:53.120 --> 48:54.320
I'm trying so hard.

48:54.320 --> 48:55.600
It hurts my Ron esteem.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.640
I don't like that one bit.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.880
Can you give me the question one more time, Griffin?

49:00.880 --> 49:02.720
Is it okay to draw on a dog with magic marker?

49:03.520 --> 49:06.400
Sometimes when my stepdad Ron grounds me, I'll write messages on my dog.

49:06.400 --> 49:10.640
He is white with magic marker.

49:10.640 --> 49:14.480
Just little messages, like if I need food or about how much I hate my stepdad Ron.

49:15.200 --> 49:19.920
I'm imagining like a Yorkshire Terrier like bounding down the stairs running up to Ron

49:19.920 --> 49:22.960
and it's like a message on him like, hey, Ron, I smell that chili.

49:22.960 --> 49:23.600
What the fuck?

49:23.600 --> 49:24.880
You're such a bastard.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.240
I'm super hungry.

49:26.240 --> 49:27.600
He's got a message for you, Ron.

49:27.600 --> 49:28.240
I'm a dog.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.160
And also the person asking this question is 32.

49:32.160 --> 49:32.320
Yeah.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.080
God damn you, Ron.

49:34.080 --> 49:36.480
Now, now listen to me, Sparky.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.680
I want you to go downstairs.

49:37.680 --> 49:41.200
I want you to find Ron and I want you to just wiggle in front of him.

49:41.200 --> 49:42.560
You gotta make sure he reads this.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.280
It's important.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.160
I've been trapped in this bookcase for two weeks.

49:46.160 --> 49:48.000
I gotta get some pasta up here.

49:48.000 --> 49:48.640
So hungry.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.640
Also tell Ron, fuck you, Ron.

49:51.760 --> 49:54.880
If Ron wants to rescue me, tell him to fuck clean off.

49:54.880 --> 49:55.600
I hate Ron.

49:56.160 --> 50:00.640
Tell him to send my mom and ask if my mom is back with my fruit rollups yet.

50:00.640 --> 50:03.840
I sent her to the store 20 minutes ago for fruit rollups.

50:03.840 --> 50:04.640
Oh, Mr.

50:04.640 --> 50:06.160
Perkins, you look kind of sick.

50:06.720 --> 50:07.520
What happened?

50:07.520 --> 50:08.560
Oh, is it the markers?

50:08.560 --> 50:09.060
Jesus.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.360
Seeking your skin?

50:11.360 --> 50:12.160
It's you or me, Mr.

50:12.160 --> 50:12.660
Perkins.

50:13.920 --> 50:15.440
Maybe you learned how to talk English.

50:16.640 --> 50:17.680
Stupid dog.

50:19.040 --> 50:19.680
Poor Ron.

50:21.200 --> 50:22.240
What a fucking sick bird.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.080
He's just trying to watch Extreme Home Makeover.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.880
And all of a sudden the dog trots in front of his face.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.840
It's like a drawing of a knife stab and it just appears.

50:29.840 --> 50:32.240
And it's just an arrow that says Ron.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.440
This is you, Ron.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.480
This is what I want to do to you.

50:34.480 --> 50:35.200
Look at the dog.

50:38.320 --> 50:39.280
Oh, Jesus.

50:39.280 --> 50:41.360
It says, I love you, Ron, I'm my dog.

50:41.360 --> 50:42.320
Oh, he rolled over.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.360
It says, no, I don't.

50:43.360 --> 50:45.440
And he says, fuck you, Ron, again on it.

50:45.440 --> 50:46.000
And it says, chilly.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.680
With an arrow towards the dog's penis.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.120
Tyler, I thought you were going to come pick me up from work.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.640
Did you not read the dog?

50:54.640 --> 50:57.440
I said, I said, fuck you and fuck your job.

50:57.440 --> 50:58.560
I'm not going to pick you up.

50:58.560 --> 51:00.880
Oh, and also that we were out of eggs.

51:00.880 --> 51:01.760
And also we're out of eggs.

51:01.760 --> 51:02.480
Did you tell mom?

51:03.360 --> 51:04.720
I wrote it on the dog, Ron.

51:05.360 --> 51:06.400
What else do you want me to do?

51:06.400 --> 51:07.760
What else do you want me to do?

51:07.760 --> 51:11.200
I can't, I can't force the dog to stand in front of you all day.

51:11.840 --> 51:12.880
Please just read the dog.

51:13.440 --> 51:16.560
You used all the paper for your stupid novel, Ron.

51:16.560 --> 51:17.920
Yeah, how's that going, Ron?

51:17.920 --> 51:20.000
Did you find a publisher yet?

51:21.760 --> 51:24.880
In this economy, Ron, you might as well self-publish your stupid shit.

51:24.880 --> 51:25.360
Can we?

51:25.360 --> 51:26.240
Put it on Kindle.

51:26.240 --> 51:30.080
I've got a, I've got a Tumblr dog where I just put messages.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.440
Why can't you get a Tumblr dog?

51:32.240 --> 51:34.480
Can we make it a new law?

51:35.040 --> 51:39.520
Sort of like in Game of Thrones when you, if you're a bastard, your name is Snow.

51:39.520 --> 51:42.960
Can we make it that when the second you become a stepdad, your name becomes,

51:42.960 --> 51:45.040
it just becomes Ron by law?

51:45.040 --> 51:47.200
Legally, legally speaking.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.920
I now pronounce you wife and Ron.

51:49.920 --> 51:54.000
It's not even, it's not even your name so much as like,

51:54.000 --> 51:57.440
like Earl is like an honorary title, but his name is not Earl.

51:57.440 --> 52:00.320
You're officially like the Don of this house.

52:00.320 --> 52:00.960
You're Don Ron.

52:00.960 --> 52:01.680
You're the Ron.

52:01.680 --> 52:02.320
You're the Ron.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.760
You're the Ron Don.

52:03.760 --> 52:04.880
You're the Ron Don of this.

52:10.560 --> 52:11.680
Fuck you, Ron.

52:11.680 --> 52:12.480
I'm Ron.

52:12.480 --> 52:14.080
Ron, you can fucking eat a dick.

52:14.080 --> 52:15.840
I am Ron Don Johnson.

52:15.840 --> 52:18.480
And as long as you're living underneath my roof.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.320
I am Don Ron Don Johnson.

52:20.320 --> 52:22.320
I am Don Ron Don Johnson.

52:22.320 --> 52:24.480
As long as you're living underneath my roof,

52:24.480 --> 52:27.920
you will not melt down my Miami Vice VHS tapes.

52:27.920 --> 52:28.480
Those are collector's items.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.960
And you will respect my friend Cheech Marin.

52:30.960 --> 52:32.000
He will let you.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.760
And my friend Don Ron Don Cheetle.

52:35.280 --> 52:38.400
And you'll stop sending your stupid ass Tumblr dog down

52:38.400 --> 52:43.200
with messages about how you preferred the earlier seasons of National Bridges.

52:43.200 --> 52:44.080
I'm done with you.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.400
Stop it with the Tumblr dog.

52:46.400 --> 52:47.040
We've had enough.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.560
Your mom and I are very much in love.

52:48.560 --> 52:51.440
Listen, she's not getting back with your dad.

52:51.440 --> 52:56.080
Do you think at some point you have to start using the dog to repair the relationship?

52:56.080 --> 52:59.840
Like, just a note that says, Ron, I wish we could be closer.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.160
Ron, I think we should talk.

53:02.160 --> 53:02.960
Ron, we should talk.

53:02.960 --> 53:04.480
Ron, my mom's seen sad lately.

53:04.480 --> 53:07.760
When was the last time you treated her out to a night on the tag?

53:08.320 --> 53:09.440
Night on the tag?

53:09.440 --> 53:10.640
I'm so hungry.

53:10.640 --> 53:11.360
Please send the dog.

53:13.920 --> 53:17.360
Ron, please send the dog.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.520
Please send the dog for snacks.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.000
Hate you, Ron.

53:22.000 --> 53:22.960
Hashtag hungry.

53:24.800 --> 53:25.840
So this has been our dog show.

53:25.840 --> 53:26.960
My brother, my brother, mate.

53:26.960 --> 53:28.320
Advice show for the modern era.

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of a theme song.

54:28.080 --> 54:30.640
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

54:30.640 --> 54:33.360
Thank you, guys, gang.

54:33.840 --> 54:34.560

Just send us an email or something and we'll help you out.

54:57.040 --> 55:00.160
Like a literal email through through through Web channels.

55:00.160 --> 55:02.080
Yeah, I swear to God.

55:02.080 --> 55:06.880
If somebody sends me a dead dog with stuff written on it, I get one more dog in a box.

55:06.880 --> 55:10.720
I know this finally who is also sent in by Emily Wall.

55:10.720 --> 55:11.200
Thank you.

55:11.200 --> 55:17.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sandy, who asks, Why do black men love eating chips at the

55:17.200 --> 55:17.680
beach?

55:17.680 --> 55:21.120
Is it to be energized for us ladies before they take a dip?

55:21.120 --> 55:42.880
Keep your heart three stacks.

55:42.880 --> 55:43.840
Keep your heart.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.000
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.040
Keep your heart.

55:47.040 --> 55:48.320
Man, these girls are smart.

55:48.320 --> 55:48.960
Three stacks.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.080
These girls are smart.

55:50.080 --> 55:50.720
Keep your heart.

55:50.720 --> 55:51.680
Play your part.

55:54.960 --> 55:59.200
Do black men love eating potato chips at the beach so they can have the chips before the

55:59.200 --> 56:20.720
dips in the water while covering our faces with lovely kisses.
