00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:47.280
Hello, everybody, and welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

00:47.280 --> 00:52.560
modern era. Attention, I have breaking news. I'm joined by my middle brother Travis and

00:52.560 --> 00:59.120
my youngest brother Griffin. Say hello, gentlemen. Just hello. Hello. I have breaking news. Last

00:59.120 --> 01:05.200
night, Travis was at a party where he played a steel drum. We take you now live on the scene

01:05.200 --> 01:09.440
to Travis McElroy. It was just as majestic as you would think. I felt like I was playing

01:09.440 --> 01:16.640
upside down turtle. It was lovely. I played a couple chords, and then they played Wasted

01:16.640 --> 01:22.240
Away in Margaritaville. It was transcendent. It was a two-man steel drum band because one

01:22.240 --> 01:27.680
steel drum is not enough, and they were able to do harmonies. Travis, we have eyewitness accounts

01:27.680 --> 01:33.680
from the scene of the drum that you did, in fact, rattle out the theme song to Rugrats.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.720
Is that true or false, Travis? Can you confirm or deny? Listen, I was in a haze of tequila

01:38.720 --> 01:45.120
at that point, so I may or may not have rocked it out, but I was not trying to. I don't know

01:45.120 --> 01:48.320
why you're trying to hide this from us. I don't know why you're trying to fucking sweep this

01:48.320 --> 01:55.440
under the rug. We take you now live to our analyst, Orb, who is a horse, former race

01:55.440 --> 02:01.760
championship horse. Orb has just heard this news. Orb, you've been processing this this

02:01.760 --> 02:06.400
morning. Of course, we're still trying to get all the pieces of this story about Travis

02:06.400 --> 02:13.760
playing a steel drum last night into place. What is your initial reaction to this turn

02:13.760 --> 02:18.160
of events? Orb can be played like a steel drum. He does not prefer it.

02:18.160 --> 02:25.040
So you have personal connections to this instrument. Orb is two steel drums turned

02:25.040 --> 02:29.520
to face each other. Let me ask you this, Orb, where does Travis go from here?

02:33.200 --> 02:33.760
Jamaica.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.040
Continuing our coverage of Steel Drum Gate 2014, we go live where Travis has prepared

02:43.040 --> 02:48.640
a statement. Ladies and gentlemen, I have decided to step back from my steel drum career

02:48.640 --> 02:54.320
and just spend some time rebuilding my family right now. This has been very tough on us,

02:54.320 --> 02:59.120
and especially on them, and I feel out of respect. I must not play the Rugrats theme

02:59.120 --> 03:06.240
song ever again. Breaking news, we're hearing reports from multiple sources that what Travis

03:06.240 --> 03:11.360
actually played was an upside-down garbage can and that he was actually confused. We're

03:11.360 --> 03:19.200
getting texts in. This is a scandal, but we are hearing reports that have tied his recent

03:19.200 --> 03:25.920
resignation from steel drumming to the fact that he did in fact hit an upside-down trash

03:25.920 --> 03:33.120
can with two chicken legs. Not a steel drum, as we were initially informed. Griffin, if

03:33.120 --> 03:37.840
you heard any more updates from your sources, I see you kind of pounding away on your Blackberry

03:37.840 --> 03:45.280
there. What are you hearing? We have an analyst here, Chet Chorson, who is doing some body

03:45.280 --> 03:50.000
interpretation of Travis's statements. Chet, what do you think? Sounds to me like he fucked

03:50.000 --> 03:56.960
the steel drum. Sounds to you like he fucked the steel drum. Yeah, I mean, look at him.

04:00.160 --> 04:05.440
I mean, I guess I get it. I guess I'm confused about the physiology. Think about it. Oh, yeah.

04:05.440 --> 04:11.280
Oh, sure. So obviously Travis is not owning up to this at this time. We are going to continue

04:11.280 --> 04:17.040
to monitor the situation. In the meantime, we return you to my brother, my brother and me

04:17.040 --> 04:22.320
already in progress. Friends of ours really enjoy entertaining at their apartment.

04:23.440 --> 04:30.480
My fiance and I are regularly invited for board games, chatting and on occasion dinner. My problem

04:30.480 --> 04:36.800
is our apartment is far less presentable and because of this, we do not host very often.

04:36.800 --> 04:41.520
We've taken to bringing a six pack or two with us to make up for our lack of reciprocity.

04:41.520 --> 04:48.160
Are we good or should we make a bigger effort to host for our friends? That's from Hospitality Hot

04:48.160 --> 04:52.720
Mess in Hyde Park. Well, hold on. We've got a question later. I'm going to tie this question

04:52.720 --> 04:56.880
in now and go ahead and read it. OK, I'm in college and because of that, I'm a pretty social

04:56.880 --> 05:00.000
person. I have a decent amount of friends and I'm usually either hanging out with them

05:00.000 --> 05:04.080
or someone is at my apartment. However, when people are over at my house at some point in

05:04.080 --> 05:08.560
the evening, I usually hit a point where I just want them to leave and have alone time.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.960
The problem is I never know how to gracefully kick them out. How do I tell my friends that I'm

05:12.960 --> 05:17.840
ready to be done with social time without sounding like a jerk? And that's from Semi Social Awkward

05:17.840 --> 05:24.400
at Purdue. Is there a buzzer you could buy and activate? I just feel like these connect so well

05:24.400 --> 05:30.960
because when I host, I love hosting and then there hits a point where it's like and I'm done

05:31.920 --> 05:38.080
and I want you out. OK, goodbye, everybody. And that's usually about 830. I feel like that's part

05:38.080 --> 05:43.600
of like finding your group of friends, though. Like I have a group of friends that are like

05:43.600 --> 05:50.160
perfect at this where just when I'm like, I'm ready for sleepy time, they bounce.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.960
Mm hmm. How do they know, though? Do you have do you think maybe you're more obvious about your

05:54.960 --> 06:00.480
sleepy time signals than you think you are? I mean, I do. I do come out my onesie footie

06:00.480 --> 06:05.440
pajamas. You know, you joke. I did that once. I know you're in my house. And then it was like,

06:05.440 --> 06:12.000
well, I gotta I gotta go to bed now. And I came out in my pajamas. I spend a lot of time

06:12.000 --> 06:18.720
thinking about issues like this. I tend to worry about making sure I had enough sleep before

06:18.720 --> 06:24.960
or that I can handle the situation that I won't be the first one to be sleepy. So I'll do like a

06:24.960 --> 06:30.800
five hour energy or something. I think you take a nap. I'll take a pizzazz in the afternoon.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.720
That kind of thing. I think you just have to keep you have to stay ahead of the

06:35.280 --> 06:39.520
ahead of the game. You can't collapse. You can't be the most drunk person there.

06:39.520 --> 06:44.080
You can't be most drunk. Can't be the sleepiest. Can't be the handsiest either.

06:44.080 --> 06:50.240
No, I don't like going to Darryl's house. He's very handsy. You have to be so normal when you're

06:50.240 --> 06:55.520
hosting a party. It's best to stay in the center of the room and try to, like, maintain a neutral

06:55.520 --> 07:00.720
baseline. Exactly. That's true because I'm more of an iconoclast. I think of myself as

07:01.680 --> 07:07.120
really the Auntie Mame of our family. You know, throwing a Christmas celebration in July,

07:07.120 --> 07:13.760
whimsical hats, a donkey in the living room. Auntie Justin. Justin's having another donkey

07:13.760 --> 07:21.440
show at his party. I think of myself as that. But you have to level yourself out when you're

07:21.440 --> 07:26.320
hosting because people need to know that they're safe and cared for. They don't want Auntie Mame.

07:26.320 --> 07:34.720
They want Aunt Normal. Yeah, Auntie Lame. Auntie Lame would have been a better thing.

07:35.520 --> 07:39.440
Yeah, well, we'll fix it in post. Y'all want a Yahoo? Yeah.

07:39.440 --> 07:46.480
This Yahoo was sent in by a close personal friend of mine of the show, Drew Davenport. Thank you,

07:46.480 --> 07:57.440
Drew. It's by Yahoo Answers user InnocentButDeadly. Ooh, spicy. Who asks, is it okay to do the pee-pee

07:57.440 --> 08:07.520
dance at work? I was really consumed with the task at hand and didn't want to interrupt it.

08:07.520 --> 08:13.760
By going to the restroom. Before I knew it, my bladder weighed three pounds. All the excess pee

08:13.760 --> 08:19.040
was killing me. So I finally decided to use the restroom. I crossed my thighs, tightened them

08:19.040 --> 08:24.160
while hopping. I work retail on the store level. So customers, as well as coworkers,

08:24.160 --> 08:30.560
saw my pee-pee dance. One coworker told me to stop. And after taking a huge leak in the restroom,

08:30.560 --> 08:35.840
I did. Was that normal? Well, I think it is normal for your pee-pee dance to stop.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.440
I think it is normal for your pee-pee dance to stop after you take a huge pee-pee. Yeah.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.120
It's much weirder if you do it afterwards like a celebratory touchdown dance.

08:44.160 --> 08:50.880
This person was carrying three pounds of urine in what I can only assume to be like maxed like a

08:50.880 --> 08:55.440
half pound bag. Well, you don't know. Well, I mean, without weighing the bladder first,

08:55.440 --> 08:59.360
you can't be sure that some of that three pounds wasn't, maybe they just have a really fat bladder.

08:59.360 --> 09:08.880
Yeah. A lot of flat, fat bladder. Mama Sita. That's what that song all about,

09:08.880 --> 09:13.360
that bass is all about. And Copacabana is about that too. Being proud of your bladder.

09:14.160 --> 09:21.280
And with slow love, she was a showgirl, fattest bladder in the land. Everybody give her a hand.

09:22.080 --> 09:28.480
She went merengue. You didn't hear the sloshing. Okay. What fucking thing could you be doing in

09:28.480 --> 09:33.280
a retail store level job that you're like, I cannot walk away from this. I will risk

09:34.080 --> 09:38.880
prostate and bladder problems to finish putting these price tags up.

09:40.640 --> 09:47.200
The avatar actually looks like a woman. So no prostate problems. No prostate problems.

09:48.320 --> 09:54.640
I've worked several retail jobs. I always took it as a tiny vacation when it was time to pee,

09:54.640 --> 09:58.640
because no one's going to say no. No one's going to be like, get back to work because we're not

09:58.640 --> 10:05.200
working in a gulag. You got to pee. You go pee. Maybe there's three pounds down your leg. Maybe

10:05.200 --> 10:09.920
they're selling a PB gone, a special pill that makes it so you never have to pee again.

10:10.640 --> 10:15.840
That would be very embarrassing for them and your place of business. Have you guys ever,

10:15.840 --> 10:22.000
I don't think I've ever done a pee pee dance of like, I don't think that actually,

10:22.000 --> 10:27.520
I don't think there's any physiological implications sprint. Yeah. Well, that's every

10:27.520 --> 10:33.760
time for me, every time, every time for me. And it's, it's an emergency. Have I done a pee pee

10:33.760 --> 10:42.320
dance? You know, I used to pee pee whenever I needed to like a big boy, but now I, uh, I've

10:42.320 --> 10:50.400
been sort of holding off a little bit until I just can't take it anymore because that is, I miss that

10:50.400 --> 10:56.560
movie theater. You know that tantric, tantric, tantric peeing that you do after a Lord of the

10:56.560 --> 11:02.000
rings and you think it's almost over and then it isn't, but it's close enough that you've missed

11:02.000 --> 11:07.600
all the pee times on the run P app. Yeah. Um, and so you just have to push on through. Uh,

11:07.600 --> 11:12.000
I missed that kind of pee. I wish I had that kind of pee more regularly. You know when you have to

11:12.000 --> 11:17.920
pee really bad and then suddenly just strangely the feeling just goes away for a little while.

11:17.920 --> 11:23.920
That's the scariest, scariest with that P go, uh, I'm going to give us, I'm going to allow us maybe

11:23.920 --> 11:31.120
one more minute of this. Um, but, um, I've ruined myself working from home for seven years now,

11:31.680 --> 11:38.080
uh, because I'll just go, I'll just go even when I, maybe I don't even really need to,

11:38.080 --> 11:41.600
it just like sounds like a good thing to do. I'll just go in there and do it, which has,

11:41.600 --> 11:48.640
which has reduced the iPhone game you're playing at that moment, which has reduced my ability to

11:48.640 --> 11:58.400
not go to a span of about 20 minutes. So your flange is loose. My flange, my cap, my resistor,

11:59.280 --> 12:05.840
uh, is, is, is barely non-existent at this point. But again, like I don't do a pee pee dance cause

12:05.840 --> 12:11.200
I'm a fucking adult and I know my fucking body at this point and I always know where the bathroom is.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.120
So I don't let it get to that point. Come on.

12:13.120 --> 12:21.200
I feel like a pee pee dance would just be more pressure in odd places than I would want. I feel

12:21.200 --> 12:28.160
like the best thing I can do is just sort of stay zoned, stay focused, straight line. Get my

12:28.160 --> 12:34.640
mindfulness right. Breathe in, breathe out, healing, cleansing light and just wait.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.040
For what?

12:37.040 --> 12:41.440
Till it presents itself, Griffin. Till it's time. I don't know why ever,

12:41.440 --> 12:45.840
whatever reason this guy had. I don't know. I'm 33. I pee when I want.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.160
Yeah. Sometimes when I don't want.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.880
If I want to pee, I pee. If I want to eat Captain Crunch one morning, I do. I don't care.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.360
Sometimes I sneeze really hard and I pee a little bit.

12:55.360 --> 13:00.320
God, Juice, I gotta say being 33 sounds awesome. I cannot wait to get there.

13:00.320 --> 13:08.240
Pretty cool so far. I bought a cereal that had s'more in the name today. No one cares.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.000
And you can't do that until you're 33?

13:10.000 --> 13:13.280
No one's gonna stop me. I thought the Larynade lady would say like,

13:13.280 --> 13:14.880
are you sure you want to do this?

13:14.880 --> 13:16.160
Can I check your ID?

13:16.160 --> 13:20.000
Can I see your ID? Nope. 33. You're right. Okay. Well.

13:21.600 --> 13:26.400
I thought you were starting a new question and that this is just somebody else who had done this

13:26.400 --> 13:31.840
and not you. And then I found out it was you. And then our relationship changed in a subtle,

13:31.840 --> 13:33.840
almost imperceptible way.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.280
Yeah. Irreversible.

13:35.280 --> 13:40.000
Irreversible and imperceptible. Do start a new question. I do not want to talk about pee pee

13:40.000 --> 13:44.160
anymore. Yes, you do. You just are afraid people don't want to listen to you talk about pee pee

13:44.160 --> 13:49.520
anymore. We'll do a new podcast for that. I was living with my girlfriend. I don't want to know

13:49.520 --> 13:52.240
people who would listen to that podcast. It's dirty.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.120
It'll be a pee pee and Dungeons and Dragons podcast.

13:55.120 --> 14:01.120
Pee pee. There it is. I was living with my girlfriend and another roommate for just under a

14:01.120 --> 14:06.720
year. When we broke up, she moved back home and my roommate and I moved into a new place together.

14:07.360 --> 14:12.880
Now roommate is moving out and he is claiming ownership of some of the various items my ex left

14:12.880 --> 14:21.920
behind. He claims that since we were all roommates before her and I started dating, we should split

14:21.920 --> 14:31.360
the booty equally. I claim her and I shared things. I claim her and I shared things when we started

14:31.360 --> 14:38.240
dating and anything she left behind is mine. Also, a lot of stuff in our place is actually his,

14:38.880 --> 14:43.920
so I don't think he needs any extra crap. Am I crazy or should my ex's stuff be mine now?

14:43.920 --> 14:54.400
That's from Canadian custody battle. This is some ghoulish shit. I was living with my

14:54.400 --> 14:58.480
girlfriend and another roommate. He lived with his girlfriend and they had another roommate.

14:58.480 --> 15:04.240
Him and his girlfriend broke up. She left behind a bunch of stuff. The roommate, they're moving out

15:04.240 --> 15:08.720
now and the roommate wants some of the ex-girlfriend stuff because they were roommates.

15:08.720 --> 15:15.120
This is what is ghoulish. Does this person have extra claim on the things that this

15:15.120 --> 15:20.320
roommate left behind? Which is totally fair. When a roommate leaves and doesn't take their shit and

15:20.320 --> 15:26.960
expresses no interest in taking their shit, congratulations. Now you have things. But does

15:26.960 --> 15:32.960
the person who actually dated the woman get- And if I'm reading the question correctly,

15:32.960 --> 15:38.720
they started dating after they all moved in together. We were all roommates before her and I

15:38.720 --> 15:42.880
started dating. That's a rookie mistake by the way. Yeah. I almost feel like you should have to

15:42.880 --> 15:49.680
give the non-dating roommate everything because you fucked up so grandly. That is correct. If

15:49.680 --> 15:56.640
nothing else, even if it had gone super well, you did put roommate in position of being like

15:56.640 --> 16:02.800
permanent third wheel. So maybe he gets that box set DVD. You know what I mean? Maybe he gets all

16:02.800 --> 16:10.960
of F-Troop. She left her F-Troop box set and roommate wants it. What are you going to do?

16:10.960 --> 16:14.400
Split them up? You take season one, he takes season two? That doesn't make any sense. Just

16:14.400 --> 16:20.080
give him the whole box set. You're both going to be missing integral parts of the F-Troop crew

16:20.080 --> 16:24.640
line. You won't know how it ends. You won't know where it begins. It'll just be a mess. Yeah. Can

16:24.640 --> 16:30.880
you have a- Okay, let me hit you with this. Each of you has $500 of Monopoly money. You invite a

16:30.880 --> 16:38.240
third party over. It's going to be Jeff Probst. It's Jeff Probst. He's the ex. And then he does

16:38.240 --> 16:42.320
a survivor style auction. You don't know when it's going to stop. You don't know what the items will

16:42.320 --> 16:48.800
be, but you get to bid on the ex's thing. So that way you can get the things that you need the most,

16:48.800 --> 16:53.920
like maybe rice for the camp. You know what I like about that, Justin? That not only is a practical

16:53.920 --> 16:58.400
idea, that sounds fun. Yeah, it sounds like you'd have a great time. Probst probably wouldn't have

16:58.400 --> 17:04.960
a great time auctioning off his own goods to his ex-lover. But, you know, just side note,

17:04.960 --> 17:09.680
so Teresa and I moved into Los Angeles and I had an idea pop in my head. It was like, you know,

17:09.680 --> 17:13.520
it would be way more affordable if we got like a two or three bedroom apartment and then got a

17:13.520 --> 17:18.320
roommate. And then I couldn't think of anything weirder for some, and I'm sure that people out

17:18.320 --> 17:23.440
there do it and I'm not trying to throw shade, but the idea of like a married couple finding like a

17:23.440 --> 17:29.200
roommate was really weird to me. Yeah. Is that crazy? Oh, you're going to get a lot of applicants

17:29.200 --> 17:34.800
that show up like, hey, my name is Tom. Yeah, I have a great job in the city. I'll be able to

17:34.800 --> 17:41.600
make you guys into cuckold. Also, I don't like washing windows. I really like living with you

17:41.600 --> 17:52.480
guys. I'm really getting into the swing of it. Okay, let's watch a movie. I was at a party last

17:52.480 --> 17:57.760
night and a friend of mine was showing us how Tinder works because I asked because I've never

17:57.760 --> 18:03.200
seen it before. And one of my other friends instinctively saw a picture of a guy and thought

18:03.200 --> 18:08.400
he looked cool. And so they liked him, which is how Tanner works. You either like or dislike them.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.400
And if you both like each other, you get a notification that you have a match. And so he

18:12.400 --> 18:18.400
did it because the guy looked cool without having any additional info information. Holy shit. That

18:18.400 --> 18:26.560
way it's called Tinder because you get a match. That might be it. And then they match. And then

18:26.560 --> 18:37.680
we clicked through below the jump there to read some additional info. And he's married and he

18:37.680 --> 18:47.440
travels on business a lot. Business with a capital B, he said. And he is into cuckold and he is into

18:47.440 --> 18:57.440
making fantasies come true. He's into quote, teaching women how to squirt. Fantastic. Thank

18:57.440 --> 19:06.000
you, Roger, very much. And he finished out his monologue by saying that he is into nail clipper

19:06.000 --> 19:16.000
play. That's a new chestnut that I'm going to throw into a volcano. But he's making dreams come

19:16.000 --> 19:20.400
true. He's making fantasies come true. That's pretty cool. Wait, he's he's making fantasies

19:20.400 --> 19:25.200
come true for unsuspecting people. Could, and he travels a lot. Could this be Ty Pennington

19:25.200 --> 19:30.800
from Extreme Home Makeover? Is that possible? Business with a capital B. It was actually

19:30.800 --> 19:41.760
Jareth, the Goblin King. Squirt, magic squirt. My comic book collection is getting quite large

19:41.760 --> 19:46.880
and I'm running out of space to store all my single accounts. Oh Justin, what the fuck did,

19:46.880 --> 19:54.240
what did we do yesterday? I can't, we can't say. We can't talk about it. Many of them I only read

19:54.240 --> 20:00.560
once and then store it in a long box. I want to go all digital, but I don't know how to tell my

20:00.560 --> 20:06.240
comic book shop that I don't need a pull list anymore. That's from Colin. Colin is describing,

20:06.240 --> 20:10.640
I think, the biggest problem with comic books. I really like comic books as like a reading

20:10.640 --> 20:18.960
experience and I hate everything else. I hate paying four dollars for five minutes of something

20:18.960 --> 20:25.520
and then a lifetime of guilt. Ironically, I find that I feel the same way about going into a comic

20:25.520 --> 20:29.280
book store the same way I feel about going into a high-end like Ben's fashion store,

20:29.840 --> 20:33.840
where it always seems like it's going to be a cool, fun, like let's find, and then it's like,

20:33.840 --> 20:38.000
oh yeah, no way. All this stuff costs way too much money for me to actually buy it. Cool.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.240
And so, but I guess what confuses me about this question is,

20:42.240 --> 20:47.680
isn't that the point of comic books? Is owning, is like having a collection of them?

20:47.680 --> 20:53.440
No, I mean digital, digital comics are taken off in a big, big way and I'm sure that,

20:53.440 --> 20:58.000
I mean, I think your best bet is to just ghost and maybe they'll think that you're dead or

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
something because I think you calling and saying, hey, I am actively, actively contributing to the

21:04.000 --> 21:08.880
erosion of your whole thing here. They're not going to take this.

21:08.880 --> 21:13.680
Yeah, that's better. Hold on. Tell him you're going on an extended vacation,

21:13.680 --> 21:19.920
so not to do the pull list, and you will call him when you get back in town so he can start

21:19.920 --> 21:25.520
pulling the comics for you again and then just never call him again. So lie, lie real good.

21:25.520 --> 21:29.200
Well, so that way, because if you just ghost, he's going to keep pulling them and end up with

21:29.200 --> 21:34.480
this huge stack and be like, where's Colin? I guess just call the comic book store and say,

21:34.480 --> 21:38.960
hey, this is Josh Richardson, so I'll pull my comics by and then hang up really fast.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.840
Your comic book dealer is probably already a little panicked about the advent of digital

21:43.840 --> 21:50.320
comics. If you call and say, listen, I'm going all digital, you're only going to keep him up at night,

21:50.320 --> 21:58.960
provide him with more anxiety. If you don't call and leave no inclination of your indication of

21:58.960 --> 22:05.200
your whereabouts, he's going to think you're dead. Can I read a Yahoo? That is a nice segue here.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.320
I feel like we didn't help Colin at all, but yes.

22:08.880 --> 22:13.920
I mean, we did our best. This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport also. Thank you, Drew. It's by

22:13.920 --> 22:21.200
Yahoo Answers user, Dr. Quantum, who asks, I want to read Dilbert. Where should I start?

22:21.200 --> 22:28.240
Good comic book store. I've never read Dilbert, but a friend of mine, first of all, what?

22:30.400 --> 22:34.240
I've never read Dilbert, but a friend of mine usually talks about it, and I think I'll like it,

22:34.240 --> 22:41.440
but he couldn't tell me where is a good place to start. Thoughts? You could start at the death

22:41.440 --> 22:51.120
slash rebirth of Dilbert Ark. Oh, sure. After Dilbert Civil War. I love the 11th Dilbert

22:51.120 --> 22:56.320
. I mean, you never forget your first Dilbert, but the 11th Dilbert provides a great jumping

22:56.320 --> 23:01.520
off point. I think I really liked the brightest Dilbert, darkest Dilbert miniseries. Yeah,

23:01.520 --> 23:05.760
that was pretty good. Dilbert, there's Dilbert Ultimatum. That's pretty good.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.240
The Dilbert Amalgam where he mixed with Garfield. That was a pretty good one. I like that one a lot.

23:10.240 --> 23:15.840
I don't like the crossover shit. Okay. No, I don't like the Dilbert Avengers. There's like

23:15.840 --> 23:21.760
amazing Dilbert. There's ultimate Dilbert. There's extreme Dilbert. Dilbert 1999. There's Dilbert.

23:21.760 --> 23:31.200
There's Dilbert teens. And that's there's Pigbert. There's Pigbert. There's zombie Dilbert,

23:31.200 --> 23:34.960
which is like obviously Marvel was just fucking having a field day with that one.

23:37.360 --> 23:40.960
You got to take I think the best place. I think you go back to the beginning.

23:40.960 --> 23:46.640
I think you go straight to always postpone meetings with time wasting morons. See if you

23:46.640 --> 23:52.640
can find it in the original printing. It's got a better cover. And then from there you go to

23:52.640 --> 23:58.400
Dogbert's Clues for the Clueless. It's the third book, but in a way it's the second. Yeah, yeah.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.360
And then Shave the Whales.

24:01.360 --> 24:07.680
Shave the Whales. Motherfucker.

24:08.560 --> 24:12.720
Still pumped from using the mouse is another good jumping off point.

24:12.720 --> 24:19.760
And maybe do some readings. Do some reading Scott Adams. Maybe read some of his big ideas.

24:20.880 --> 24:27.040
Yeah, and then kind of figure out where you're at after that. Okay, so here is the game.

24:27.040 --> 24:34.000
Are you ready? Yeah, I am going to read either the name of a Dilbert collection.

24:34.560 --> 24:40.960
Oh Jesus. Or the name of a Jimmy Buffett song. It's always that then. Okay,

24:41.600 --> 24:50.320
breathe in, breathe out, move on. That's a Jim James Buffett. Okay, when body language goes bad.

24:50.320 --> 24:56.640
Oh damn. I'm gonna go Dilbert. I'm gonna say James Buffett. That is Dilbert. Correct, Travis.

24:56.640 --> 25:08.960
Congratulations. Positive attitude. Oh shit. Is Scott Adams a pen name for Jimmy Buffett?

25:10.720 --> 25:17.920
I'm going Dilbert. Positive attitude? I think that's actually Jim Buffett. That is Dilbert.

25:17.920 --> 25:28.160
Yes. Son of a bitch. Dear Jimmy Buffett. Dilbert. Yeah, I think it's Dilbert. Sorry that's Jimmy

25:28.160 --> 25:33.280
Buffett because his name is in it. I thought it was a Scott Adams love letter. Oh, this is a good

25:33.280 --> 25:42.560
one. This is a good one. You ready? The Dilbert principle. Margaritaville. Okay, let's get the

25:42.560 --> 25:46.880
money zone. I'm just throwing out that it's five o'clock somewhere works for both. Yeah,

25:46.880 --> 25:50.480
it's five o'clock somewhere would be an excellent Dilbert book. So does Dogbert's Clues for the

25:50.480 --> 26:03.680
Clueless. It was Dogbert's Clues for the Clueless. And a pineapple smiled nearby. He went a little

26:03.680 --> 26:13.680
Randy Newman there at the end. Here's some truth. I've been struggling with anxiety for the past

26:13.680 --> 26:24.000
few months. And part of that is that I try to stay in a pretty positive place. And as a result,

26:24.000 --> 26:31.200
I have listened to exclusively Radio Margaritaville on SiriusXM for the past three months.

26:31.920 --> 26:39.040
I mean, exclusively. We're talking tear off the knob. You're in Jimmy's hands now. I guess I'm

26:39.040 --> 26:44.400
not comfortable with you. Jimmy take the wheel. Jimmy take the wheel of my car. I'm not really

26:44.400 --> 26:49.040
comfortable with you drinking and driving though, Justin, I have to say. No, Jimmy Buffett is

26:49.040 --> 26:56.560
drinking for your ears. Yesterday, here is the point that we have reached. Now to be clear,

26:56.560 --> 27:00.800
Radio Margaritaville is not just Jimmy Buffett tunes, although wait a few minutes, one will come

27:00.800 --> 27:08.800
on. It's songs hand selected by Jimmy Buffett. I mean, that's what they say. I don't know. He

27:08.800 --> 27:12.240
probably has assistants. There's probably a different Jimmy Buffett in every town, like

27:12.240 --> 27:21.600
Santa Claus. But I described to Sydney yesterday, as we drove to the mall for the entire 15 minute

27:21.600 --> 27:28.480
duration of our transit to the mall on Friday, I described an imaginary Jimmy Buffett collection

27:28.480 --> 27:35.600
that I would like to construct a box set of all the tunes that I need for mental health.

27:35.600 --> 27:41.600
Just to let you guys in on the collection, the second disc is all different versions

27:42.160 --> 27:49.280
of Margaritaville live, just with different. It's your beach time prescription. It's a beach time

27:49.280 --> 27:54.560
prescription for good feelings. Here's the kicker. You ready? The first disc, guess where it kicks

27:54.560 --> 28:00.480
off with? Margaritaville. I know you're thinking Margaritaville. That's the second disc. No, you

28:00.480 --> 28:06.880
launch with I will play for gumbo. No one sees that coming. Then straight into boat drinks.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.760
I certainly would not see that coming because I don't know the fucking song.

28:16.560 --> 28:21.200
Just for the people at home, rather than our typical Money Zone music,

28:21.200 --> 28:24.880
I'm going to request that you put in the chorus of I will play for gumbo.

28:24.880 --> 28:29.120
Now see, every time you do that, I have to go to Amazon. I have to buy the fucking mp3.

28:29.120 --> 28:33.600
I'll pay you a dollar. Not that you'll need it because you'll be so into this fucking tune.

28:33.600 --> 29:01.920
Is he going to hear it? There we go into the Money Zone. Once you're full up on gumbo,

29:01.920 --> 29:08.800
you need something to counterbalance that. What pairs well with gumbo? What's the best

29:08.800 --> 29:15.360
pairing for gumbo? It's anything from NatureBox. They have delicious snacks. Literally any of them

29:15.360 --> 29:24.720
can be put atop gumbo for a crunchy or chocolatey or chewy or salty or sweet. Literally anything

29:24.720 --> 29:32.560
that comes in a bag can be put atop gumbo. That includes dishwasher tabs. Kitty litter. I actually

29:32.560 --> 29:40.240
don't know what gumbo is. Teeth. A bag of teeth. NatureBox has delicious, delicious, delicious

29:40.240 --> 29:46.320
snacks that are natural. They got no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup, and there are some

29:46.320 --> 29:52.400
that are low in sugar and have no gluten. And they ship them for free. You don't have to worry

29:52.400 --> 29:58.880
about that either. What are you guys rocking? Because I know there's some staples for you guys.

29:58.880 --> 30:06.080
Not that you don't get a big bag of staples. I would highly recommend the French Toast granola.

30:06.080 --> 30:10.080
That's very, very good. You put some milk on that, your day's going to get started

30:10.720 --> 30:15.280
really, really right. And if you're like me, I love the salty chip kind of stuff.

30:15.280 --> 30:24.560
They got sea salt pop pops. So good. They also have some Santa Fe corn stick stuff. So good.

30:25.520 --> 30:30.480
So if you try NatureBox right now, we can get you 50% off your first month's box. Just go to

family. There's something that's going to fit. I promise you, their snack selection gets bigger

your first box. No big deal. That sounds like a great deal. No need to thank us, but if you

30:57.200 --> 31:01.200
want to, we're on Twitter. So here's the thing. You've probably tried Hulu. I mean, it's been

31:01.200 --> 31:05.200
around, I think, since the internet. Can you not start with, so here's the thing. So here's the

31:05.200 --> 31:12.240
thing. Lean in. You sound like fucking Linda Ellerby, sitting backwards on a chair. Hey,

31:12.240 --> 31:17.920
let's rap. You've all tried Hulu, right? You're all cool kids, and you think you've tried Hulu,

31:17.920 --> 31:21.360
and that's fine, and you're awesome. Well, here's the thing. You think you're cool,

31:21.360 --> 31:26.800
but you haven't tried Hulu Plus. Hulu Plus is that new shit. Travis, that is a smart pantsuit

31:26.800 --> 31:33.280
you're wearing right now. Thank you. It makes me feel sexy and confident. You're both. Hulu has

31:33.280 --> 31:39.680
everything, man. They have current season episodes of shows that are on right now, like Modern Family,

31:39.680 --> 31:46.160
Daily Show with Jon Stewart. They have every episode, like deep back catalogs of shows like

31:46.160 --> 31:53.520
South Park, which is only on Hulu Plus. You can also find stuff like, you know,

31:53.520 --> 31:57.920
Teresa and I watched Parks and Rec on there, Bottle of Burgers, tons of stuff.

31:57.920 --> 32:03.600
The Prophets on there, that's one of my favorite shows basically ever, where you have a failing

32:03.600 --> 32:08.560
business, and my boy Marcus Lemonis comes into your failing business, and he says that this

32:08.560 --> 32:12.800
place sucks, but I'm gonna make it awesome, and you're gonna give me half, and for the next week,

32:12.800 --> 32:16.880
you have to do exactly what I say, you scumbag. That sounds like a great show. And by the end,

32:16.880 --> 32:21.040
they fall in love with him? Yeah. By the end, they're like, you were so right. Or sometimes,

32:21.040 --> 32:26.160
he just dips. Sometimes he's like, hey, I think you're embezzling, so I'm gonna go,

32:26.160 --> 32:30.560
and then credits. It's a great show. It sounds very good. I'm gonna check that out.

32:31.520 --> 32:38.320
It's on everything. You can use it on a smart TV, Roku, Apple TV, any gaming device basically,

32:38.320 --> 32:47.200
Xbox, PlayStation, whatever. You can do it on a phone, on a train, on a turret, at the urinal.

32:48.720 --> 32:54.560
That's a good look. That's a great look. You're gonna be there for 23 minutes plus ads,

32:55.360 --> 33:02.800
so it's gonna be hard to get comfortable, but chase your bliss. Not only that, they've got

33:02.800 --> 33:10.000
original stuff you can't find anywhere else, like the awesomes created by Seth Meyers. It's

33:10.000 --> 33:14.720
about a misfit group of superheroes, cartoons. You're gonna love it. All 10 episodes of season

33:14.720 --> 33:21.520
one. Season two just premiered, so it's a great time to go check it out. It's only eight bucks a

33:21.520 --> 33:27.680
month. You'll get your shows wherever you need them, but we can give you a two-week free trial

33:27.680 --> 33:33.840
if you go to huluplus.com slash my brother, all one word. Normally the trial's one week. We're

33:33.840 --> 33:38.320
gonna give you a second one in case you're really dragging your fucking heels on this.

33:38.320 --> 33:42.240
So make sure you go to huluplus.com slash my brother so that it counts towards us and makes

33:42.240 --> 33:54.720
us look so good. I just gotta get a message to Hal from Lori. Lori says, I'm so happy you said yes.

33:54.720 --> 34:02.080
I'm so happy you said yes and that I beat you to it and I got to do the asking. I told you that

34:02.080 --> 34:07.440
road trip to West Virginia would only be the first of our adventures together. I love you so much

34:08.480 --> 34:14.720
and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. That's from Hal. Well, it's from Lori to Hal.

34:15.440 --> 34:19.040
But I think it's also a little bit from Hal, if you really look inside your heart.

34:19.040 --> 34:26.160
Lori came- they came to see Superman. Did they? My show Superman, yep. They sound- they sound

34:26.160 --> 34:31.280
super sweet. So she asked him for his hand, it sounds like. Apparently his hand. I don't know

34:31.280 --> 34:38.320
what- she doesn't specify, so maybe it's just like they wanted- she wanted to go see Transformers

34:38.320 --> 34:44.000
Rise of the Fallen and he was like, yeah, I'm glad you asked and said yes. Because I would be

34:44.000 --> 34:48.320
embarrassed to ask that of you. And then while they were there, Optimus Prime married them.

34:48.320 --> 34:55.200
Surprise! Surprise. So congratulations, you two. I'm so happy and I'm glad that you're in love.

34:55.760 --> 35:03.520
I got another message from Ian, Alex, and Rebecca. Three ways split there. For Jessica.

35:05.120 --> 35:10.080
And her last name's here, but I don't think that's Jermaine. Hi, Mabim Bam. Because our amazing big

35:10.080 --> 35:14.960
sis Jessica is now happily engaged to her incredible man Jake, we thought she deserved

35:14.960 --> 35:19.440
a shout out on her favorite podcast. And this- I don't know why I make them sound like they're

35:19.440 --> 35:24.880
from fucking He-Haw. I'm sure you guys are great. Sorry. Despite her leaving us for a kick-ass new

35:24.880 --> 35:32.320
life in Nashville, we love her all the same. Congratulations, Jessica on your encouragement.

35:33.840 --> 35:42.800
Oh no, Ian's melting. We'll miss your bunches. Love your wee siblings.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.800
Oh man. Uncle Joe, he is a moving kind of slow at the junction.

35:48.320 --> 35:54.720
Petticoat Junction. Man, that's so sweet. Love is in the air. Kind of sound like

35:54.720 --> 35:59.920
nerdy buddy in the club getting married. Love this. Love this. Man, I'd hate to be an unmarried

35:59.920 --> 36:04.880
person right now. Am I right, guys? Come on, don't drop that. Why are you throwing shade?

36:06.960 --> 36:11.520
Bikini season. Volleyball time. Hot dogs and hamburgers. Get ready to Olympic dive.

36:11.520 --> 36:16.560
Fourth of July. Are you ready for rollerblading rain time? That's right. It's Aaron and Brian

36:16.560 --> 36:20.880
from Throwing Shade, if you didn't know from that very clear intro. We take a look at issues

36:20.880 --> 36:24.000
involving ladies and gays and we treat them with much less respect than they deserve. So

36:24.000 --> 36:28.400
watch out, punks. So hey, download us and take us to the beach while you're doing your summertime fun.

36:32.560 --> 36:37.840
How about a yahoo? Hit me. I'm ready. We just did Dilbert, but there's some important topics

36:37.840 --> 36:43.200
in here. This one was sent in by John Jelnick. I believe that's how you pronounce his name.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.600
Thank you, John. I'm just going to be more confident with that shit.

36:47.360 --> 36:52.720
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user. Fucking thing's not popping up.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.840
It's a weird name. What's your fucking... I can't... He has no name.

36:59.360 --> 37:05.760
He has no name. This is unprecedented. Okay. Well, it was asked by some Yahoo Answers user.

37:05.760 --> 37:10.880
I'm going to assume they were just deleted. The phantom of Yahoo Answers. Can we assume that

37:10.880 --> 37:19.200
if we reach the singularity, the first thing the AI will do is destroy Yahoo Answers? It's too

37:19.200 --> 37:24.320
helpful. I hope so. I also hope that about the rapture, about the super volcano eruption,

37:24.320 --> 37:30.240
I hope that about everything, that it's the first against the law. This mystery user asks,

37:30.240 --> 37:34.480
what would your reaction be if a stranger asked you to briefly watch their child,

37:34.480 --> 37:39.280
say in a store or waiting room while they slipped away briefly to use the restroom, pay, et cetera?

37:39.280 --> 37:46.640
It does seem like a setup for like a, I don't know, jackass or like, is a candid camera still

37:46.640 --> 37:52.000
a thing? Well, that would be both a terrible jackass and a terrible candid camera. It would

37:52.000 --> 37:57.520
be... I mean, this is John Quinones. Like, John Quinones does this on the weekends for fun,

37:57.520 --> 38:07.120
I think. He just asks adults to watch. Does this say something about us as a people now that my,

38:07.120 --> 38:12.080
I don't know how it hit you guys, non-jokey style. My immediate, immediate reaction was,

38:12.080 --> 38:20.560
I would say, well, no. No, no, I don't want that on me. No, thank you. Remind me, Griffin,

38:20.560 --> 38:25.520
does it say like, given circumstance where they are, what's going on? They're going into the

38:25.520 --> 38:29.600
changing room of say an H&M and they have their child with them and they say, sorry,

38:29.600 --> 38:35.280
can you watch him just for a minute? Do you know what makes this okay? What? If you had your own

38:35.280 --> 38:41.600
kid with you. No, because now I'm too, too deep. Now I'm not numbered. Well, how old's the kid?

38:41.600 --> 38:49.520
I'm thinking like stroller age. Says 16 years old. No, because then you give this kid a part-time

38:49.520 --> 38:56.480
job. Do I get back? What if that other kid like fucking made a shiv out of Pokemon carbs and

38:56.480 --> 39:03.520
stabs your kid? I'm saying, you know, I wouldn't, I would double not trusted another kid, another,

39:03.520 --> 39:11.120
like probably flea infested child near my perfect human specimen. I did no way, no way on earth.

39:11.120 --> 39:15.920
My perfect Dakota. And let me throw out this situation. Hey, can you watch my kid? I'm just

39:15.920 --> 39:20.160
going to duck in here real quick. Two hours later, they still haven't returned. Now you're

39:20.160 --> 39:23.760
stuck with this extra kid. Yeah. That's, I mean, that is the, what would you do? That's,

39:23.760 --> 39:30.560
that's Kenyanses game is how long can we make a person own a child? I mean, I think the only

39:30.560 --> 39:36.480
rational response is to find the next person you see and ask them if they will watch your kid.

39:36.480 --> 39:42.160
It's basically like the ring of kids. Like you, you, you ask them to watch the kid and then it's

39:42.160 --> 39:45.920
their, their problem. That's what that song, it takes a whole village to raise a child is about

39:45.920 --> 39:51.120
is I'm going to H and M. Can you watch this little thug for a second? And then you're like, sure.

39:51.120 --> 40:00.320
Hey, sorry. Um, I'm got to go run to blockbuster blockbuster. Can you watch this closing in five

40:00.320 --> 40:06.240
minutes? Also kids, kids aren't allowed in it because most blockbusters are infested with

40:06.240 --> 40:12.960
coyotes at this point. Um, can you, I'm going to the coyote run, the fear will run blockbuster.

40:12.960 --> 40:19.520
Can you watch this kid? Yeah, sure. I guess I was about to go to dip and dots, dip and dots.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.440
That's great. Cause it's the ice cream of the future and a video store with the past.

40:26.400 --> 40:33.440
I haven't been to a fucking mall since 1996. I got to hit up this orange Julius.

40:33.440 --> 40:38.400
Oh shit. That was going to be mine. You beat me to it.

40:43.600 --> 40:47.840
Yeah. I, but like, I'm serious. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it.

40:47.840 --> 40:52.560
And everybody on Yahoo responding to this question is like, nope, nope. Not a chance

40:52.560 --> 40:57.920
in hell. No way. No, never. And does that mean like, have we, as a culture, like,

40:57.920 --> 41:03.760
I, is this like part of the mounting evidence that we are just fucked? Because I think back

41:03.760 --> 41:08.960
in like the fifties, this probably happened all the time. Like, hey, so it's where you see a lot

41:08.960 --> 41:14.960
in the fifties, like just general adults using the fact that they're adults as like

41:15.520 --> 41:20.720
carte blanche to yell at kids. Like you think about that these days, like if another adult

41:20.720 --> 41:26.160
yelled at your kid, that would be crazy. But you see that all the time in ye olden days.

41:26.160 --> 41:34.720
But like also just giving absolute responsibility of your child to a human that you just fucking ran

41:34.720 --> 41:40.880
into at Sam's club. So a couple of days ago, I was at a, I was at a food cart and I was also

41:40.880 --> 41:45.920
working a show. I was doing sound for the tour and I ordered my food and it was taking forever

41:45.920 --> 41:49.600
to come out and it was really coming down to the wire. Like I had like three minutes to get back

41:49.600 --> 41:53.840
to my table and run sound when the show started. And this woman next to me said like, oh, do you

41:53.840 --> 41:57.680
have to get back over there? And I was like, yeah. And she was like, okay, well, if you want to go,

41:57.680 --> 42:03.840
I'll just bring your food to you. I'll, I'll grab your food. Okay. And I said, no, I was like, no,

42:03.840 --> 42:09.040
I'm good because I didn't trust her with my grilled cheese sandwich. Can we just take a second

42:09.040 --> 42:14.880
and just appreciate the moment? This moment. I want to live in this moment forever where Travis

42:14.880 --> 42:21.680
has just equated his ownership and consumption of this grilled cheese sandwich to the protection

42:21.680 --> 42:29.040
to the protection of your human life that you created. What my point is times that by a million.

42:29.040 --> 42:33.440
Okay. So you recognize that make it, does that make it more likely for me to say like,

42:33.440 --> 42:39.120
Hey, could you just hold on to this baby for a second? I, I know, like I don't trust people

42:39.120 --> 42:43.120
with my grilled cheese. I ain't going to trust people with my baby. Anybody that would entrust

42:44.240 --> 42:51.280
their child to another person is a rogue agent. They are off the reservation as far as society.

42:51.280 --> 42:55.280
That person is capable of anything. And where, where does that leave the kid?

42:56.320 --> 43:00.000
And I think that it becomes doubly true of the person volunteer. Like if there's someone standing

43:00.000 --> 43:03.120
next to you while you've got your baby and you're trying to like take care of something,

43:03.120 --> 43:06.800
like if you need me to watch your kid for you while you go do that, I understand. It's like,

43:06.800 --> 43:11.520
Oh no, you're going to take my baby. You're a baby taker voluntarily.

43:11.520 --> 43:18.240
If someone offers that's no, that's unacceptable. I recently moved to a new city. I've joined a

43:18.240 --> 43:23.600
popular dating website and have been meeting and getting it with a variety of interesting people.

43:23.600 --> 43:27.760
I'm pretty sure dudes are attracted to my, I don't give a heck bad attitude.

43:27.760 --> 43:28.400
Fantastic.

43:29.040 --> 43:33.760
That's excellent. However, the two times I've gotten genuinely excited to meet someone,

43:33.760 --> 43:38.800
I flubbed the first encounter with my nervousness and awkward conversation and then drunkenly texted

43:38.800 --> 43:43.680
them apologies afterwards. Oops. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds like bad attitude. All right.

43:43.680 --> 43:47.040
That's I don't give a heck bad attitude. You're capturing that spirit perfectly.

43:47.040 --> 43:53.520
Oops. How do I learn to play it cooler in the face of serious relationship potential?

43:53.520 --> 43:56.240
That's from old school crazy in Oregon.

43:56.880 --> 44:03.040
So if I'm okay. So when they, when she doesn't care, she kills it. She does great.

44:03.760 --> 44:07.920
And then when she actually cares, she's getting real uptight.

44:08.640 --> 44:11.040
When she meets a nail clipper enthusiast,

44:11.040 --> 44:17.280
who's going to make our fantasies come true. Someone who's got bad attitude with a capital

44:17.280 --> 44:23.280
B. Just say Ty Pennington. Ty Pennington. So when you meet Ty Pennington, you get a little

44:23.280 --> 44:31.600
bit awkward and then drunkenly text apologies, which in any circumstance ever is never a good

44:31.600 --> 44:37.760
call. Never, never. Well, when you're drunk, texting anything to anyone for any reason is

44:37.760 --> 44:43.600
a bad idea. Unless it's help. Unless it's whoops. I just, I like, yeah. Cause you're

44:43.600 --> 44:47.440
compounding it at that point. If you have an awkward day, that's fine. If you text them

44:47.440 --> 44:52.480
afterwards, like sorry, I was so weird. Then that's, you've just hit, you just took it to

44:52.480 --> 44:57.120
the next level. Especially if you interpreted it as awkward, but they didn't. And they thought it

44:57.120 --> 45:01.040
was like a perfectly good time. And then you're like, so, so I was so awkward. And they're like,

45:01.040 --> 45:06.160
this person's crazy. Here's the reason you got to play a cool hot shot. Because if you do

45:06.160 --> 45:11.040
apologize for acting weird, whether or not you acted weird, you've just ceded all the,

45:11.040 --> 45:16.480
your territory in the relationship. Do you have already given your prospective future husband

45:17.280 --> 45:25.360
the ball, as it were. It's in his corner now. So you can't ever apologize unless you've been

45:25.360 --> 45:34.160
with someone for six years. Correct. Hold on. Yes. My wife and I haven't been together for six years.

45:34.160 --> 45:37.760
Then you haven't hit that wall yet. Good. You haven't had to apologize yet, right?

45:39.760 --> 45:47.680
Yes. So he said, I just hit six years and I had an apology that lasted 36 hours.

45:48.800 --> 45:58.000
I'm so, okay. If you're really excited about the date and you know that you have a tendency

45:58.000 --> 46:04.800
towards like getting awkward in the conversation, why not pick a first date location that, that

46:04.800 --> 46:10.960
inherently has something you could discuss about. So like go see a movie and then go to dinner

46:11.600 --> 46:15.040
or go see a movie and then go to drink. So you can talk about movie or go to dinner somewhere,

46:15.040 --> 46:20.080
like, you know, where they cook right there at the table or something interesting to talk about.

46:20.080 --> 46:25.600
Shut up. Oh, wait, there's endless conference. Can you believe this beat? Can you believe the

46:25.600 --> 46:30.320
steam? I did another cool thing with the knife. I was trying to think of a place. I was trying

46:30.320 --> 46:35.760
to think of a place where they do something interesting, but wouldn't also be like terrifying

46:35.760 --> 46:42.320
if it went bad. Oh, I hope he doesn't throw the shrimp at me. I don't know if I can catch the

46:42.320 --> 46:50.080
shrimp. Oh no, here it comes. Oh, I did it. I'm really enjoying this date. You should try it too.

46:50.080 --> 46:56.000
It's real fun. You get a little bit of shrimp grease on your chin, but otherwise it's a good time.

46:58.000 --> 47:07.440
I love you. I love you, I think. I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this. And then they leave. Oh

47:07.440 --> 47:16.080
God. What was that? What was I doing that whole time? I was doing a weird voice the whole time.

47:16.080 --> 47:22.080
I've got to email them and say I'm sorry. I have to just shoot them a quick written

47:22.080 --> 47:27.760
physical letter. Just a quick voicemail. Don't tell me not to do it chef at the table. I'm

47:27.760 --> 47:31.760
doing it. I'm just going to leave five or six voicemails while you're sitting next to me.

47:31.760 --> 47:38.160
Oh, hold on. Hey, I'm sorry I did a weird thing. God damn it.

47:38.160 --> 47:46.000
The whole time you're just being pelted with shrimp. Pay attention. I'm throwing shrimp at you.

47:46.000 --> 47:54.240
Just be confident in yourself and your abilities. Y'all want a Yahoo?

47:55.360 --> 48:04.960
Yeah. This Yahoo is sent in by Ira Ray. Are you Ira Ray? Who wants to know? Thank you Ira Ray.

48:04.960 --> 48:10.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user. They've been suspended. Fuck me. This is a blood bath this week.

48:11.520 --> 48:17.760
They ask, would people eat less if air had a flavor?

48:20.800 --> 48:29.760
Would people eat less if air had a flavor? Isn't this basically what vaping is? I guess so. But

48:29.760 --> 48:42.720
imagine that everywhere. You walk into a room and you're like a cat. I have two questions. One,

48:42.720 --> 48:48.080
does different air in different places have a different flavor? Yes. What a nightmare. I guess

48:48.080 --> 48:54.480
air does have a flavor. Hold on. Let me think about that. Are you saying that maybe air has

48:54.480 --> 48:58.640
had a pronounced flavor and you're just desensitized to it? No, I'm saying air probably has a very

48:58.640 --> 49:03.920
subtle flavor. It tastes like air. Yeah. There's particles and atoms and molecules and shit. We're

49:03.920 --> 49:09.840
tasting it. You're only ever tasting air. You're constantly tasting air. Right. That's what I'm

49:09.840 --> 49:15.040
saying. I don't even recognize. The taste of air has become your de facto, there is no taste. I'm

49:15.040 --> 49:21.680
not tasting it. Right. If we could morph it. If we could chop and screw that flavor. When you walk

49:21.680 --> 49:28.880
into my house, baby back ribs, right? Because I love that song from the Chili's commercials.

49:28.880 --> 49:33.680
But maybe I walk into Travis's house. That would also probably be ribs. No, I think garlic mashed

49:33.680 --> 49:38.960
potatoes. Oh, God. I mean, that's a good thing to eat, but it's not a good thing to air taste. No,

49:38.960 --> 49:44.800
but see, but that's the question. Does it smell like that? No. That would be the super fucked

49:44.800 --> 49:49.200
up thing is that it wouldn't smell like taters. It would only taste like it. But smell is an

49:49.200 --> 49:53.840
essential component of taste. The two would have to work in concert. You only think that because

49:53.840 --> 49:58.080
Neil deGrasse Tyson told you that. Yeah, he's full of lies. It doesn't. I mean, maybe he's

49:58.080 --> 50:02.640
not full of lies, but not everything is. He's not going to hit them all. You know, I'm saying

50:03.840 --> 50:07.600
actually, I would probably be like something like a Skittle or a Mike and Ike. I feel like

50:07.600 --> 50:12.400
most people would go sweet over savory. Yeah, I think so, too. But you don't want to like ruin.

50:12.400 --> 50:20.640
And you don't want to ruin a meal if I forget to turn off the flavorizer in the room and then like

50:20.640 --> 50:24.880
I serve up some lasagna, but I have the Skittle still going. That's going to be a bad eating

50:24.880 --> 50:29.280
experience. Well, I mean, that's the question. Is it like uncontrollably smells like it tastes

50:29.280 --> 50:34.400
like that? Or is it like you have a knob next to your thermostat that you turn up the flavorizer?

50:36.160 --> 50:41.440
Oh, do you want to? You want a little bit more Mars bar? OK, OK. Oh, my God. Tom, wake up. Wake

50:41.440 --> 50:47.360
up. Did we turn the flavorizer off? Oh, if we get home and our home really spaghetti,

50:49.360 --> 50:55.760
you would open up the door and just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

50:55.760 --> 51:09.920
it's so much spaghetti. I'm overwhelmed by the taste. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm not going to

51:09.920 --> 51:17.120
be able to taste real spaghetti for a week. Eat the air. Eat the air as fast as you can.

51:17.120 --> 51:24.880
Your way to the flavorizer. Oh, God. All the flavorizers are level two. Oh, Jesus. Invite

51:24.880 --> 51:30.640
the neighborhood dogs in to eat some of the spaghetti. They would die. They would fucking die.

51:31.280 --> 51:38.880
I'm going to stay at my mom's house. Tastes like split pea soup. Oh, Jesus. Would people eat less,

51:38.880 --> 51:42.720
though? Probably not. You can't fucking stop us. No, if anything, they would eat more. Yeah.

51:42.720 --> 51:46.160
Because they would be like, well, now I want spaghetti. Yeah. I actually do this to myself

51:46.160 --> 51:51.200
with the sensi's all the time where I put in a nice berry tart. Yeah. Who's making berry tart?

51:51.200 --> 51:57.360
No one is. Well, now I have to. And then you drink the liquid to get that flavor. It burns my tongue.
