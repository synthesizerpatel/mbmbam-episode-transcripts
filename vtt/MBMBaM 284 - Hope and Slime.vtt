00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.440
Who's that whispering in the trees? It's two citizens there on leave.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.800
Hi everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the

00:52.800 --> 00:57.840
modern era. I'm the Cherry Poppin' Daddies. It's 1996. It's 1996 and I'm the Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.360
I'm the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Travis McElroy.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.760
And I'm Scabies, Griffin McElroy. Now you might not be familiar with Scabies.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.800
Is it like Scabies?

01:07.600 --> 01:15.200
That was the play on words. My ska band from 1997. We came in kind of at the tail end,

01:15.200 --> 01:21.680
Swingers Mania. That was the name of my band was Scabies, and nobody ever came to any of our shows

01:21.680 --> 01:23.360
and we did like 150 of them.

01:23.360 --> 01:31.600
Do you know how, like think about the ancillary costs of being the Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.880
Think about how many people they forced to say those words.

01:38.240 --> 01:43.840
Think about the fact that like, think about at one point Casey Kasem, God rest his soul,

01:43.840 --> 01:46.160
probably had to say Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

01:46.160 --> 01:46.720
Yeah.

01:46.720 --> 01:51.920
There had to be a moment where he turned to his producer and was like, I'm not gonna say this.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.200
I'm an adult.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.400
Coming in at number one.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.600
My refusal to say Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.680
Don't we have anything by the Mighty Mighty Boss tones?

01:59.680 --> 02:01.760
I don't find that displeasurable.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.280
Casey, we've talked to you about this.

02:03.280 --> 02:07.280
Please don't phrase all conversations in the form of a top 40 list.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.760
Well, I mean, it was either that or Hymen Wreckers.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.400
It's the worst.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.200
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.240
Hymen Wreckers is worse than Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.560
Yeah, because mine is at least clinical in nature.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.240
It's, well, that's true.

02:27.200 --> 02:33.120
But like, but Cherry Poppin' Daddies, I think, insert, does insert this sort of like

02:34.160 --> 02:36.480
gleeful, almost Robin Hood-esque,

02:37.440 --> 02:44.160
roguish, as if one cherry hasn't popped and they've leapt into the trees to go pop cherries

02:44.160 --> 02:48.720
another day before like the sheriff of Nottingham can catch them.

02:48.720 --> 02:56.000
For my money, it's not the Cherry Poppin' part of their nom de plume that I disagree with

02:56.000 --> 02:58.720
and wish to throw into a lake somewhere.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.240
It's the daddies part.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.920
Because why does it have to be that?

03:01.920 --> 03:06.400
It couldn't, they're both bad, both parts of it, right?

03:06.400 --> 03:10.000
But why do you have to have the daddies on the end of it too?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.880
Because that's genuinely upsetting in combination with the earlier two words.

03:14.880 --> 03:15.280
Agreed.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.160
Why couldn't it be the Cherry Poppin' friends, the Cherry Poppin' guys?

03:18.160 --> 03:20.880
Why couldn't it just be like the good time down home ska band?

03:21.680 --> 03:24.000
You know, it's swing time.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.920
That would certainly be ideal, wouldn't it?

03:25.920 --> 03:31.440
You could guess what the Cherry Poppin' Daddies are up to for, uh, a hundred years,

03:31.440 --> 03:34.480
and not guess the most recent fact on their Wikipedia,

03:34.480 --> 03:43.040
which is in a Huffington Post interview, the lead singer of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies said,

03:43.040 --> 03:50.560
uh, my plan is to do a Psychobilly slash Zappa slash American Idiot

03:50.560 --> 03:57.200
slash R. Cum type record that paints a picture of the American socio-political scene circa 2014.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.400
Yay!

03:58.400 --> 03:59.760
Wait, why 2014?

03:59.760 --> 04:02.080
You're two years behind already, Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

04:02.080 --> 04:02.720
Well, I mean, I guess-

04:02.720 --> 04:04.800
These guys, like, do swing music.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.040
They're not really, like, up to date.

04:07.040 --> 04:11.120
Well, this interview, uh, is 20, I mean-

04:11.120 --> 04:14.160
This interview happened, this interview happened in 1999.

04:14.160 --> 04:14.800
How did he know?

04:15.360 --> 04:16.800
15 years in the future.

04:16.800 --> 04:17.520
Let me tell you, it's gonna get-

04:17.520 --> 04:19.600
The Cherry Poppin' Daddies are unstuck in time.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.040
It's gonna get all fucked up, guys.

04:21.040 --> 04:24.160
Social media, we're all gonna be real dicks to each other for a long time.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.760
Uh, he also mentioned in that same interview from 2014

04:29.760 --> 04:33.040
that he had recently obtained the rights to Zoot Suit Riot,

04:33.040 --> 04:35.440
and so I bet, I mean, just in time, I guess.

04:35.440 --> 04:41.200
Uh, oh my god, I'm reading the lyrics to Zoot Suit Riot right now.

04:41.200 --> 04:41.600
Hold on.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.480
And this- this song was released in the late 90s,

04:44.480 --> 04:46.720
and one of the verses starts out, um,

04:47.360 --> 04:49.680
hashtag snapchat sexting too.

04:49.680 --> 04:54.000
So, like, they, like, are- they are able to see through time.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.280
They have pierced the veil of time.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.840
Do you remember their hit song, Our First Black President?

05:00.560 --> 05:01.600
Oh my god.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.480
Yeah, whoa, whoa.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.960
That one had a- that one had a nice beat I could dance to.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.080
Uh, oh god.

05:08.640 --> 05:14.560
Oh no, their song- they have a song called the 2017 All Flu,

05:14.560 --> 05:17.520
and it's the dark all flu will consume the globe.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.000
Oh shit.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
None left but the bugs and rats.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.560
Oh no.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.160
That was one of their ballads.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.760
But they have a song right here that's-

05:25.760 --> 05:29.600
they have a song right here that said Carly Rae Jepsen will have the summer jam of 2016.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.840
So, like, I'm fucking super on board with that.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.440
That's a look forward to.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.560
Yeah, before the all flu consumes- just consumes us all,

05:36.560 --> 05:38.880
at least we'll have, like, some good tunes to go out to.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.280
Thanks, Cherry Pop and Nostradamy.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.560
Yeah, you guys are great.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.520
As you've certainly guessed by now, this is an advice show.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.720
Um, how the fuck did we- like, what was the-

05:48.720 --> 05:50.720
why did we start talking about Cherry Pop and Daddies?

05:51.440 --> 05:52.640
What was the- what was the scene that we planned?

05:52.640 --> 05:55.040
The better question is why did we stop talking about Cherry Pop and Daddies?

05:55.040 --> 05:56.080
Yeah, good point.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.440
It's a whole episode.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.400
Uh, it- I'll tell you- I'll tell you, Griffin, honestly, the truth is,

06:00.400 --> 06:01.680
we introduced ourselves, right?

06:01.680 --> 06:02.480
Justin McElroy.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.520
Yeah, that's when I said that great scobbies joke.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.480
Yeah, it's great.

06:06.480 --> 06:10.240
Uh, I- I- I think they were on my mind because, um,

06:10.880 --> 06:13.360
there were a few people campaigning on Twitter

06:14.400 --> 06:17.920
that we should never say part the kimono again

06:17.920 --> 06:19.920
because they found it morally repugnant.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.960
Mm-hmm.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.560
Just the whole phrase and idea.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.360
And, um-

06:23.360 --> 06:25.840
Do they not understand that- that we also do?

06:25.840 --> 06:27.280
Yeah, that's disgusting.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.360
That's what I'm struggling with right now is, like,

06:29.360 --> 06:32.400
it's disgusting and repellent and I'm still using it.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.520
In this sort of, like,

06:34.320 --> 06:36.240
how would you- like, immersion therapy?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.920
Like, trying to- to rob it of its power over me

06:39.920 --> 06:42.000
by, like, just really employing it.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.240
And I think that was on my mind

06:44.240 --> 06:46.320
when I started talking about the Cherry Pop and Daddies

06:46.320 --> 06:48.960
because I'm trying to, like, think of just a list-

06:48.960 --> 06:51.360
you were making a list of morally repugnant things.

06:51.360 --> 06:55.360
Just repellent things that I need to, like, overcome in my day-to-day life.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.400
Okay, yeah.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.960
Oh, you can always, uh, you know, drop part the kimono

06:58.960 --> 07:01.360
and get back to put the tiger on the table.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.200
Um, and yell at it?

07:03.200 --> 07:03.760
Was that it?

07:03.760 --> 07:04.320
Fuck, I don't know.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.680
We gotta rewind the tapes.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.680
Was ass- ass deep in alligators?

07:07.680 --> 07:08.960
I think that was in there.

07:08.960 --> 07:09.360
Maybe.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.080
Hey, this is crazy, uh, brothers.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.680
Uh, we got a voicemail this week.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.080
That voicemail line-

07:16.080 --> 07:17.280
Holy shit.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.920
Here- so here's- this is an actual true story.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.400
We got a voicemail from somebody, uh, this week.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.480
If you don't remember, back when the show first started,

07:24.480 --> 07:26.800
like, a long, long, long, long, long time ago,

07:26.800 --> 07:29.680
we had a voicemail line, uh, that people could call

07:29.680 --> 07:30.720
and leave us a message.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.760
And I think- did we- did we edit them into the show?

07:33.760 --> 07:35.120
Like, I don't think we did.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.080
I don't think we ever did.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.080
I think they were just for our enjoyment.

07:38.080 --> 07:38.560
But, um-

07:38.560 --> 07:40.640
Maybe we could, like, try to do that at some point.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.880
No, no, because when we tried to do it last time,

07:42.880 --> 07:45.680
it became a fucking repository for people

07:45.680 --> 07:47.760
who would do, like, fucking whippets

07:47.760 --> 07:50.480
and then just, like, barf garbage into our voicemail.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.680
And we had to listen to all of the-

07:51.680 --> 07:54.160
Like, you could hear them, like, finishing the whippet

07:54.160 --> 07:55.440
as the voicemail started.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.320
Okay, wait.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.200
Like, uh, hey, brothers, what's up?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.680
I'm Carolyn and fuck.

08:01.680 --> 08:02.720
Fuck.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.720
Um, I'm gonna go chill.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.080
I need some orange slices.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.800
Uh, no, I think that, um-

08:08.800 --> 08:11.120
So anyway, I got the- I got an email notification

08:11.120 --> 08:11.920
that we had gotten a voicemail.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.280
I was like, aw, shit.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.080
So I listened to it.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.520
Then I was like, wait a minute.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.400
What is the number for the voicemail?

08:18.400 --> 08:22.880
I have no clue of what the voicemail box number is.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.160
And so there was a phone number in the email notification.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.440
I was like, oh, shit, that must be it.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.800
So I'm gonna call it real quick and just-

08:28.800 --> 08:30.880
I forgot what the message was and everything.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.880
And I- so I called and, uh, it was ring, ring, ring, ring.

08:34.880 --> 08:35.920
And then, hello?

08:37.200 --> 08:40.640
Oh, this isn't what I expected to happen.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.560
Turned out that that phone number was the phone number

08:42.560 --> 08:43.920
of the person who had left the Google post.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.440
No, Justin!

08:45.440 --> 08:48.480
I just called this person at about 10 30 at night.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.200
Just like, to kind of sh- just out of nowhere.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.480
Hi, this is Justin.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.360
I'm lonely.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.400
Hi, this is Justin.

08:54.400 --> 08:54.960
Did you call?

08:55.760 --> 08:56.080
So-

08:56.080 --> 08:57.600
Do you want to be my friend?

08:57.600 --> 08:58.800
Did you have a chat?

08:58.800 --> 08:59.120
What?

08:59.120 --> 09:00.000
Yeah, we said hi.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.640
It's a cool dude.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.400
Very complimentary.

09:03.040 --> 09:03.840
And, uh-

09:03.840 --> 09:06.000
It would be great if that guy just assumed that, like,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.960
everybody who, like, everybody was just getting Justin calls

09:08.960 --> 09:09.600
all the time.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.160
The fucking-

09:10.160 --> 09:11.440
Justin called them back.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.680
The sweet treat for that dude, he didn't even realize,

09:13.680 --> 09:17.040
but the sweet treat for that dude is that I was a hair's

09:17.040 --> 09:19.840
breadth away from tweeting that number out like,

09:19.840 --> 09:21.360
hey, let's do some voicemails again.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.120
I miss it.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.080
Oh, shit.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.360
All right, let's use some advice.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.280
If you can find that number, please tweet it at me.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.960
Yeah, that's sad that we don't know.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.840
I want to say it's like something something mabim bam one.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.640
Something like that.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.920
Yeah, I don't remember it.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.680
This is the- and it's un-Googleable.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.720
I've tried to Google it.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.920
I couldn't find it there either.

09:39.920 --> 09:40.160
Damn it.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.760
This is the second winner.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.120
Anyway, these are not voicemails.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.480
These are emails people have sent to mbmbam at maximum fun.org.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.640
These are like voicemails, but with words.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.560
Voicemails you type.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.360
Here we go.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.760
This is the second winner that I've owned my home.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.480
Thankfully, I don't have a very big section or sidewalk

09:56.480 --> 09:59.280
driveway that I need to clear snow from.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.640
But despite it's not being very big, it's still something I need to do.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.320
What's the neighborly etiquette for removing snow?

10:06.320 --> 10:09.200
Some of my neighbors get out there and remove snow so quickly,

10:09.200 --> 10:12.240
and I have more of a philosophy of I'll do it when it fits my schedule.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.840
If it snows overnight, do I have to take care of it first thing in the morning?

10:15.840 --> 10:17.360
I can't wait till I get home from work.

10:18.160 --> 10:22.160
I already think my neighbors judge me for not being right on top of those outdoor chores,

10:22.160 --> 10:25.520
like mowing the lawn, raking the leaves, snow removal, etc.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.160
Yes. Thank you for including snow removal in the group.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.000
I already forgot what these emails are about.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.680
I'd forgotten what you're talking about.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.800
What are some thoughts on neighborly etiquette for removing snow?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.920
And that's from I'll shovel when I get to it in Wisconsin.

10:38.880 --> 10:42.560
Well, I think it's important to note that I think it's too different.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.560
I think your driveway is one thing and the sidewalk is another.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.960
Because I don't think your neighbors give two shits what you do with your driveway.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.200
No, but postwoman Melinda is going to care what's up with your sidewalk.

10:55.200 --> 10:55.920
Exactly.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.600
Like the old lady that lives next door to you that needs to get down to the corner

10:59.600 --> 11:02.560
to catch the bus and has to walk through two feet of snow

11:02.560 --> 11:04.960
because you just decided you'll do it when you get home.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.160
That might be an ish.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.760
You were the one who decided to live between an old lady's house

11:09.760 --> 11:12.320
and a store labeled Old Lady Pills.

11:12.320 --> 11:12.880
Bargains.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.120
Yeah.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.040
What's the name of the store?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.040
Old Lady's Pills.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.960
Underneath that sign, there's a smaller side.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.520
Hold on.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.040
Bargains.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.800
The subtitle to the store.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.000
I was trying to make the store as appealing as I could to old ladies.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.880
And about two blocks down, the Old Lady Pills store colon origins.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.120
The Old Lady Pills store rises.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.600
Hey, have you been to Old Lady Pills store ascendant yet?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.440
It's a brash new take.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.960
It's got webisodes.

11:46.960 --> 11:51.200
It's a dark webisode reboot and it's fucking horrible.

11:51.200 --> 12:00.800
It's a flash-based 18-part webisode series about a store called Old Lady Pills.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.200
It's like a choose your own adventure YouTube dive.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.960
I don't want to spoil it, but she gets the pills.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.400
But not how you might think.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.800
My new Old Lady Pills store is a Twitch channel

12:14.800 --> 12:17.600
where people vote on whether or not the old ladies get pills.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.760
I'm just glad there's so many audience-facing Old Lady Pills stores now.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.160
You gotta just consider the public use section of your zone

12:32.800 --> 12:34.160
and then take care of that.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.360
That's just common courtesy.

12:36.880 --> 12:37.440
Travis is right.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.480
That's a different thing from like,

12:38.480 --> 12:41.200
oh, you let your grass grow too tall and it doesn't look good.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.000
I mean, you should still tend to your shit.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.800
But it's not as important as like the thing that could kill an old person.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.520
Well, because the problem is if you wait too long

12:51.520 --> 12:56.640
and if you become known as the dude who doesn't do it till like 5.30 PM or some shit,

12:57.280 --> 13:00.480
someone in your neighborhood is going to start doing it for you.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.800
And I know that that sounds cool, but that's not going to feel good.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.920
Here's what I want you to do.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.360
And then you turn it into a little fun game.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.400
I've been really in the gamifying my processes lately.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.800
You take a roll of lifesavers.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.160
And then when you wake up and you got that fresh, crisp powder,

13:17.680 --> 13:19.920
I want you to close your eyes and spin around 10 times

13:19.920 --> 13:21.840
and then just throw it into your yard.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.520
And then when you're digging, it's like a little fun game.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.360
Where are those lifesavers at?

13:27.360 --> 13:29.280
Where's my buried treasure?

13:29.280 --> 13:30.400
Where's my fruity reward?

13:33.840 --> 13:37.920
I do that with like most of the things in my life.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.840
You hide lifesavers in them?

13:39.840 --> 13:40.320
Yeah.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.120
Like if I want to, if I need to do them, but I can't like,

13:43.120 --> 13:45.600
but I can't like bring myself to do it.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.120
Tuck some in the cat litter.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.080
Good.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.440
Oh, now I'll clean it out.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.560
There's pineapples in there.

13:50.560 --> 13:54.720
I'm way into just throwing rock salt down.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.880
Cause I feel like that even if that doesn't melt enough of the snow and ice,

13:58.880 --> 14:03.440
it gives you like a grit, a nice gritty sort of grit

14:03.440 --> 14:05.040
that is going to minimize.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.080
Can you put a little bit of salt in there?

14:10.080 --> 14:13.120
Can you put a sign on your yard that says I work nights?

14:15.120 --> 14:16.240
Hey, chill out.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.360
Hey, wouldn't that be the easiest thing?

14:17.360 --> 14:18.720
You don't know my situation.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.920
I don't know your situation.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.480
Exactly.

14:20.480 --> 14:25.280
A sign in your yard, six foot by six foot, that says I work nights.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.520
And then that way, whoa, wait a minute.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.880
That could get you out of a lot of stuff, right?

14:30.880 --> 14:31.280
What do you mean?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.960
Like somebody comes to the door.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.080
You don't feel like it.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.160
Like you just can't right now with that.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.520
You can't right now with that.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.320
Put a sign up in the front yard that says I work nights.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.320
That means they come to the door.

14:42.880 --> 14:43.920
It's during the daytime.

14:43.920 --> 14:44.720
They're going to see that sign.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.560
They're going to think, oh, I shouldn't.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.680
I really shouldn't bother them.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.040
They're probably sleeping.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.760
They come back at night and then you still don't answer.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.160
They're like, oh shit, he's at work.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.680
I should break in.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.320
But then you're there.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.280
But you're there.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.720
Uh oh, honey pot.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.840
What I'm saying is if you have a sign as a sign that says I work nights,

15:05.840 --> 15:07.760
um, you don't have to do anything anymore.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.200
Why is your yard not shuffled?

15:09.200 --> 15:13.840
Well, I work nights, so I guess I'll get to it tonight in the freezing cold.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.000
If that's what you want from me, I guess.

15:16.000 --> 15:16.800
I don't know.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:17.600 --> 15:22.960
I thought you had a human soul, but I guess I'll go out and shovel it after working.

15:22.960 --> 15:23.680
After working?

15:23.680 --> 15:25.520
I guess I'll get to it at like three.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.600
You jerk.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.560
You jerk.

15:28.560 --> 15:33.840
Is there not a neighborhood child that you could pay ten dollars like every time it snows,

15:33.840 --> 15:38.240
they get really excited and they're like ten dollars and they jump to, they knock on the

15:38.240 --> 15:42.000
door, you answer in like your robe and slippies with a coffee and you're like, this is good

15:42.000 --> 15:44.640
enough and you give them ten dollars and you never have to worry about it.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.920
And then they do a super duper shitty job because they're a little kid and what the

15:47.920 --> 15:48.080
fuck do they do?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.120
Well, but then you give them five.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.080
It's a sliding scale.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.200
It's good for the economy.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.400
It's capitalism, you know?

15:52.400 --> 15:56.480
Okay, but you need to bump both those up because ten dollars doesn't buy shit for shit anymore.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.640
Well, then another kid moves in, he does it for eight, you know, and now you're competing.

16:00.640 --> 16:05.680
I completely did this at my last house, but there was a lot of foot traffic.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.680
I'm just having, I don't even have a snow shovel because I believe in like putting money

16:09.680 --> 16:11.120
back in the economy.

16:11.120 --> 16:15.520
Yeah, so I don't even have a social, but I'm just having this, the terrifying realization

16:15.520 --> 16:18.000
like nobody's going to come to my house now.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.280
It's a, it's more removed.

16:19.920 --> 16:20.720
No one's going to come here.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.040
What am I going to do?

16:21.040 --> 16:22.320
You're like on a call this act.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.600
I think you're fine as is just like leaving her.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.440
Just leaving her.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.640
Just leaving her.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.800
Just leave her.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.080
How about a Yahoo?

16:32.080 --> 16:32.400
Please.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.160
This Yahoo was sent in.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.040
This is, this is fucking service journalism.

16:37.600 --> 16:41.760
What we're about to do because like maybe a dozen people sent this Yahoo in.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.960
And thank you, all of you.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.400
They are anonymous.

16:50.160 --> 16:56.000
I'll call them rope.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.400
You're calling them rope.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.200
Their name is rope.

16:59.200 --> 17:04.720
Rope asks, do you ship planets together or no?

17:06.960 --> 17:09.280
I ship Mercury and Mars.

17:09.840 --> 17:10.320
Yes.

17:10.320 --> 17:10.480
No.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.480
Oh, okay.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.080
Yes, the planets only.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.400
IDK why I do what I do.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.800
And then there's like a really creepy smiley face emoticon.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.400
I think they are fine together since they both have lots in common.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.200
They're both red.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.480
They're both quite windy.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.880
They're quite familiar with this planet, etc.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.920
What about you?

17:29.920 --> 17:32.720
Be a sweet and innocent please and thank you.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.000
Update.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.880
Anyone else a Mercury X Mars shipper?

17:36.880 --> 17:37.520
Just me?

17:37.520 --> 17:38.160
Okay.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.240
And I mean by relationships.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.200
Update two.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.880
I also ship stars.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.680
My fav one is Sol and Sirius.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.200
Our sun times, the star Sirius equals true love.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.640
Not sure what any of that meant.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.560
But let's ship the fuck out of these astral bodies, gentlemen.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.520
Well, here's the thing.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.720
I think the obvious option, and I think we were all thinking it,

17:58.720 --> 18:00.480
so I'll just come right out and say it.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.000
It's Earth and Pluto.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.040
Now hear me out.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.880
Earth is the popular girl, right?

18:05.440 --> 18:07.440
Everybody loves Earth.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.400
Everybody loves Earth.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.320
Pluto, he's an outcast.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.040
He's dark.

18:11.040 --> 18:11.680
He's brooding.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.640
He's a little cold.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.800
Everyone's like, stay away from Pluto.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.480
He'll treat you wrong, right?

18:16.480 --> 18:17.440
He's not even a planet.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.720
He doesn't belong with us.

18:18.720 --> 18:19.920
But Earth sees something there.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.680
But at first she's afraid, right?

18:21.680 --> 18:25.920
Because she thinks, oh, I need to keep up my popular girl,

18:25.920 --> 18:26.800
cool girl image.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.960
But then she spends a little time with Pluto,

18:28.960 --> 18:30.720
and she sees something there.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.840
He's got some moons.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.520
He's got some heart.

18:34.320 --> 18:37.120
And once she gets past his frozen shell,

18:37.760 --> 18:38.800
there's something there.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.000
I don't think Pluto has moons.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.920
I think they classified it as a moon, didn't they?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.800
No, I think Pluto's got moons.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.560
It's fucking big old dumpy moons.

18:46.560 --> 18:53.200
Can I just request that Earth not get into any relationships

18:53.200 --> 18:55.840
with any other planets?

18:55.840 --> 18:58.000
Because we're all having a lot of fun here today.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.960
If Earth fucks another planet, we die.

19:00.960 --> 19:01.920
We're done, though.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.200
Yeah, we're done.

19:03.200 --> 19:03.760
That's it.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.960
There's no intercourse where that works out well for us.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.600
The Earth is the protagonist of the solar system.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.320
It's the emotional core of the solar system.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.760
So I know the most about it.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.400
I want to match it up with a planet.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.080
I feel like Jupiter, we could have some fun there.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.440
A lot of dumpy moons.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.600
To be fair, isn't the Earth and the Sun already

19:27.600 --> 19:30.240
in a pretty solid, loving relationship?

19:30.240 --> 19:32.000
Yeah, but the Sun is a polygamist

19:32.000 --> 19:33.040
because they're in a relationship.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.880
Yeah, but we're the only one that it treats right.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.560
We're the only one that could sustain life

19:37.760 --> 19:40.640
that we don't burn or are too cold.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.600
I can't imagine Earth's going to be very popular

19:43.600 --> 19:45.200
with the other planets, because they're

19:45.200 --> 19:47.200
going to get a little too close to Earth,

19:47.200 --> 19:49.600
and they're going to be like, what is that itchy shit

19:49.600 --> 19:50.480
all over you?

19:50.480 --> 19:51.840
What is that smell?

19:51.840 --> 19:54.400
What is that smell and itchy, gross shit on you?

19:54.400 --> 19:56.560
And Earth's going to be like, ah, that's life.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.600
I don't know what happened.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.280
I got colonized.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.120
I need to see somebody about that.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.160
A planet doctor.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.960
I like Earth-Mercury.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.960
I think that's a fun match up.

20:08.960 --> 20:09.440
Yeah.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.720
Oh, you could call it mirth.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.720
Earth, there's a Japanese concept called tsundere,

20:15.600 --> 20:17.280
and it just means like a character

20:17.280 --> 20:18.560
that plays you hot and cold.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.560
I feel like that's Mercury all over, isn't it?

20:20.560 --> 20:23.360
Like you, Mercury's like, nah, nah, Earth,

20:23.360 --> 20:25.360
never going to get it, never going to get it.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.880
But then it turns around, faces the right way,

20:28.880 --> 20:30.720
and it's like, nah, come here, come closer.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.200
I feel like-

20:31.200 --> 20:33.200
See, I was going to say that like Mars and Earth

20:33.200 --> 20:35.200
have like a Sam and Diane kind of thing.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.000
You know, where it's just like, will we land on it?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.360
Oh, we kind of landed on it.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.560
Oh, but nothing happened.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.000
Oh, will we get people there?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.120
Well, who knows?

20:43.120 --> 20:45.840
Mars is like a lot of women I've loved

20:45.840 --> 20:48.720
in that I have spent a considerable amount of time

20:48.720 --> 20:50.160
looking at them through a telescope.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.240
Okay, okay, okay.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.560
Oh, bring it back, Jerry Pop and Daddy.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.160
We're going to reel it back on in.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.120
Let's pull that one back.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.240
Let me hit you guys with this.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.680
Let's stop being so geocentric.

21:02.560 --> 21:07.360
I want to pitch you with Mars cross Jupiter

21:07.920 --> 21:09.920
and think about that for a second.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.200
Obviously, there is a spatial difference

21:13.200 --> 21:14.320
in terms of scale,

21:15.520 --> 21:18.240
but also they're separated by the great asteroid belt.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.880
And I feel like that's fucking pretty romantic, don't you?

21:22.240 --> 21:28.560
Separated by an ocean of a cosmic ocean of unforgiving rock,

21:28.560 --> 21:31.200
but these two lovers just want to be together.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.000
Don't you think?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.680
Their families don't approve.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.120
And also the asteroid belt separating them is problematic.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.920
Okay, everyone on this side of the asteroid belt

21:39.920 --> 21:42.560
is on Team Cool Guys.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.360
And everyone on that side of the asteroid belt

21:45.360 --> 21:47.760
is on another team that is not Team Cool Guys.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.520
Just like in Romeo and Juliet.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.080
I couldn't think of a name with Team Cool Guys,

21:54.080 --> 21:56.960
which would be a way better version of Romeo and Juliet.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.560
We Cool Guys hate you, not Cool Guys.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.280
Bite my thumb.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.520
But yeah, think about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.120
How have we not talked about Saturn,

22:07.120 --> 22:10.400
the most beautiful planet in the solar system?

22:10.400 --> 22:12.560
Saturn is aesthetically dope.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.640
Yeah, but he's stuck up, isn't he?

22:14.640 --> 22:16.960
Ooh, Saturn's a boy to you, huh?

22:16.960 --> 22:17.200
Yeah.

22:17.840 --> 22:18.240
Okay.

22:19.360 --> 22:22.000
Why is that an issue even at all?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.560
I don't know, but for some reason to me, Saturn was a lady.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.560
Interesting.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.200
I think Venus is a woman, because it's right there.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.040
But all the other ones, I think it's a fucking grab bag.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.920
What about Orion's Belt plus the Big Dipper?

22:37.920 --> 22:40.880
Okay, so now we're just sort of expanding the scale of it.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.240
Well, stars are included in there,

22:42.240 --> 22:43.920
and I don't know any proper names.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.560
Okay.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.920
What about Beetlejuice and Lydia?

22:49.280 --> 22:50.800
Yeah, that's a good one, actually.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.000
I never really understood,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.480
is there a romantic thing going on there or what?

22:54.480 --> 22:55.280
That would be bad.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.840
Yeah, but now that she's in Beetlejuice 2,

22:57.840 --> 22:58.880
the sequel to Beetlejuice,

23:01.040 --> 23:02.160
Beetlejuice-ier.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.920
Are they going to be romantically involved?

23:03.920 --> 23:07.120
Well, in the cartoon, she was much more like his little buddy.

23:07.120 --> 23:07.360
Yeah.

23:08.240 --> 23:08.880
Yeah.

23:08.880 --> 23:12.800
It's definitely in the movie, he tries to marry her.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.600
That is true.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.160
That's true.

23:14.720 --> 23:19.280
And that would be a bad union, because there would be a lot of

23:19.280 --> 23:23.600
what I'm just going to go ahead and call ever so delicately, slime time.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.680
You know, I bet there's going to be a joke in the next Beetlejuice movie,

23:29.680 --> 23:31.680
Beetlejuice 2, the sequel to Beetlejuice.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.280
Beetlejuice-ier returns, returns ascension.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.920
When he gets out of black and white stripe cell phone

23:39.920 --> 23:41.920
and starts pounding keys on, he's like,

23:41.920 --> 23:44.080
hey, check it out, Tweedlejuice.

23:44.080 --> 23:44.800
And he's tweeting.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.480
That's pretty good.

23:46.480 --> 23:46.960
Yeah.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.640
Oh, can I just tell you something?

23:48.640 --> 23:48.880
Yeah.

23:49.440 --> 23:54.240
My penis shriveled up when you made that joke,

23:54.240 --> 23:56.720
because I think it did predictively.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.960
Like, just because I know you're so right.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.280
You're right, and that is going to happen.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.720
And it is going to happen.

24:02.720 --> 24:02.960
Yeah.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.280
I don't think that's a good joke.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.240
Don't get it twisted.

24:07.280 --> 24:11.280
Although if it's delivered by the inimitable Michael Keaton,

24:11.280 --> 24:12.320
he could probably sell it.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.960
Do you think there will also be a joke where he's wearing the black and white suit

24:14.960 --> 24:16.000
and he goes, look, I'm thick.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.680
Something along those lines of thick reference.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.400
This guy, I just hate all these blurred lines, Lydia.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.600
I came back from the digs.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.200
This guy digs stealing my look.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.800
It's so Beetlejuice-sounding.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.760
Yeah, it is absolutely.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.520
Can we cut out the middle man and just get thick in the picture?

24:35.280 --> 24:39.840
Thick is Beetlejuice's junior in Beetlejuice 2,

24:39.840 --> 24:42.320
the sequel to Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice here.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.920
He's Beetlejuice's-

24:43.920 --> 24:44.640
Ascension.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.040
You left out Ascension, and that's an important part of the brand.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.560
He doesn't think his dad's cool.

24:48.560 --> 24:51.600
He thinks his dad's yesterday's news, but he still loves his look.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.160
Nope, I'm not ready for him to come back in my life yet.

24:54.160 --> 24:54.480
I'm not ready.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.360
How about another question?

24:55.360 --> 24:59.200
Like, some days I don't have much energy, and I want to take a nap.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.240
If I don't set an alarm, I end up sleeping for hours,

25:02.240 --> 25:04.240
and wake up feeling groggy and gross.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.960
When I do set alarm for 15 to 20 minutes,

25:06.960 --> 25:09.520
I never seem to fall asleep, and am I napping wrong?

25:09.520 --> 25:11.680
How can I master the art of the nap?

25:11.680 --> 25:13.840
Tired in Toronto, we have got your back.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.200
You are talking to three professional nappers.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.080
Nap genius.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.360
I wish somebody would annotate Justin's naps.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.400
Annotate my naps.

25:24.400 --> 25:28.080
It would just be a string of, he looks so adorable.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.440
He looks like an angel.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.080
Look at him.

25:30.080 --> 25:30.960
Is he glowing?

25:30.960 --> 25:32.880
It seems like a precious nap light.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.080
He's napping actually a centimeter off of the bed.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.040
You can't tell, but there's actually air between Justin

25:39.040 --> 25:40.640
and whatever surface he's napping on.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.320
Now why does Justin make constant kissing noises while he's asleep?

25:44.320 --> 25:47.360
Well, no one really knows for sure, but here's my theory.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.760
Dream kisses.

25:49.760 --> 25:50.880
Naps are personal.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.080
You can do naps wrong.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.600
A lot of people say they can't do naps.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.040
It's because you're doing them wrong.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.240
I want to tell you my nap strategy, because it's very personal, I think,

25:58.240 --> 25:59.920
but here's what I do, okay?

25:59.920 --> 26:01.600
It's very scientific.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.440
I use an app called Pziz.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.240
That's P-Z-I-Z-Z.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.440
You still on Pziz?

26:05.440 --> 26:06.480
Still on Pziz.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.840
I started to get worried at, no joke,

26:07.840 --> 26:10.320
started to get worried about some like Manchurian candidate shit

26:10.320 --> 26:13.600
happening via Pziz as the delivery vehicle.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.560
It does work though, right?

26:14.560 --> 26:17.680
Like it puts you to, it's a nap, it's an application.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.120
Yeah, I mean, it's a creepy, it's a creepy nap application.

26:21.120 --> 26:24.320
It's not an application where you set the exact amount of time

26:24.320 --> 26:25.520
that you want to go to sleep.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.920
For me, it's 25 minutes.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.640
If I set a nap for 25 minutes.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.080
Five minute warm up to fall asleep,

26:32.080 --> 26:32.720
and then 20 minutes of unconsciousness.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.040
And then 20 minutes of perfect unconscious sleep.

26:35.040 --> 26:39.760
If you sleep for, the next nap station that you can,

26:39.760 --> 26:41.760
see the naps go in a circle, right?

26:41.760 --> 26:42.800
They're like a curve.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.840
It's a curve.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.920
So a full cycle of sleep takes about 90 minutes

26:47.920 --> 26:50.560
from peak to valley to peak.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.440
So if you wake up at 45 minutes,

26:53.440 --> 26:54.880
you're gonna be right in the middle of a valley.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.240
You're gonna be way deep in REM,

26:56.240 --> 26:57.840
and it's gonna be hell on earth.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.000
You're never gonna recover from that until that evening.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.040
But if you hit it just the right spot

27:03.040 --> 27:05.120
where you're just sort of like asleep,

27:05.120 --> 27:06.560
you can just like kickstart yourself.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.360
So that's what I do.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.400
25 minutes, invest in a sleep mask.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.920
It's totally worth it.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.960
And also I use like noise.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.360
Especially if you do funny googly eyes on the outside of it.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.480
Yes, totally worth it.

27:16.480 --> 27:19.040
That's a sight gag that never wears out.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.120
And then I use like earbuds

27:21.120 --> 27:23.280
with like some like noise cancellation shit.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.440
So like full sensory deprivation.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.240
Here's another tip, super quick,

27:28.240 --> 27:29.360
and then I'll let my brothers talk

27:29.360 --> 27:30.880
because they're like nap geniuses too.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.760
I don't get under my sheets or blankets for an hour.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.640
Interesting.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.320
I have like an outer blanket.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.160
Like I'll pull up a blanket.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.400
You have a nappy time bing bing?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.160
Like a nappy time bing bing?

27:44.160 --> 27:45.680
Because if I get under my sheets,

27:45.680 --> 27:47.360
I'm telling myself it's bedtime.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.720
But anyway, that's why a nappy time bing bing is great too.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.600
That's great.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.760
See for me, I've experimented with naps

27:53.760 --> 27:55.440
for going on 32 years now.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.360
And I feel like I finally figured it out.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.080
And that is one, I cannot nap in a bed.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.520
It's too much pressure.

28:01.520 --> 28:04.400
It's telling myself it's time for sleeping for bedtime.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.240
And it's not, I have to nap on a couch.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
And I can't nap in a quiet room.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.520
I gotta put on low level TV,

28:12.240 --> 28:13.760
something that's distracting me,

28:13.760 --> 28:15.200
that's clicking off like,

28:15.200 --> 28:16.880
hey, you're not trying to fall asleep.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.400
You're just going to fall asleep.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.720
Because if I try to fall asleep, I will not.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.760
So I need something that's like lulling me to bed.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.040
And I use the alarm.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.520
I just tell Siri, wake me up in 25 minutes.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.200
I don't go through the like programming.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.200
I don't make a big rigamarole.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.800
Don't make it a big deal.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.120
I just say like, Siri, wake me up in 25 minutes.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.560
Sleep, right?

28:38.560 --> 28:39.760
I just, and then-

28:39.760 --> 28:42.080
You're saying you literally every step of this process,

28:42.080 --> 28:43.440
you trick your body into thinking

28:43.440 --> 28:45.040
you're not about to take a nap.

28:45.040 --> 28:45.600
Exactly.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.760
You circle back around the back door.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.800
And you're talking over the door.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.800
It's like, psych, we're going to sleep.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.720
This is full body confusion.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.760
When I try to, it's too much pressure.

28:55.760 --> 28:56.560
I can't do it.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.160
I'm sitting there going, fall asleep, fall asleep,

28:58.160 --> 28:59.360
fall asleep, fall asleep.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.760
But instead I'm going, nope, just going to relax,

29:01.760 --> 29:03.200
watch some TV, I'm out.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.760
That's the way I do it.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.840
And it works because then you wake up

29:07.840 --> 29:10.080
and just as you gently fell into sleep,

29:10.080 --> 29:12.000
you gently come back out of sleep.

29:13.040 --> 29:13.680
Here's my thing.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.680
The other thing, oh, super quick, one other tip,

29:15.680 --> 29:17.360
especially if you go with this 25 minute shit,

29:17.920 --> 29:20.240
it is going to feel like you just fell asleep

29:20.240 --> 29:21.920
and that's exactly the idea.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.640
If you think, oh, 10 more minutes, you're fucked.

29:24.640 --> 29:25.680
You're fucked.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.880
Do not snooze.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.120
Don't put the alarm too close to you.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.320
Set it on the table away from you

29:30.320 --> 29:31.200
so you got to reach for it.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.440
Throw your body out of bed and just get on it.

29:33.440 --> 29:33.940
Griffin.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.800
I plan, you have to plan on taking,

29:36.800 --> 29:37.840
I'm the opposite of Travis.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.880
I plan my naps a good half day in advance.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.160
When I wake up in the morning,

29:42.160 --> 29:43.600
oh, that wasn't a very good sleep.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.040
I know I'm going to need a nap later on.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.000
That is actually true.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Griffin has told me like while we're having breakfast,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.600
like I'm going to need a nap later.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.560
Okay, yep.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.160
Yeah, my shit don't sneak up on me.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.280
I know my body at this point.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.480
I've been around for 28 years.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.200
I've had 28 years of knowing just how my body reacts

29:57.200 --> 29:58.880
to the pressures of day to day life

29:58.880 --> 30:00.640
or night to night sleep life.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.480
And so knowing that in the morning times,

30:05.520 --> 30:08.160
I take my shower and I eat my oatmeal

30:08.160 --> 30:10.480
and then I'm picking out my outfit for the day.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.360
I say, what is the tightest,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.880
most uncomfortable clothing that I own?

30:16.880 --> 30:20.000
This belt, there's not a good notch for me.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.040
There's like one that's too loose

30:21.040 --> 30:22.000
and one that's too tight.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.840
I wear that, set it to the too tight setting.

30:23.840 --> 30:27.200
I wear a shirt that I got too fat for in the holiday times.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.320
Put that right on.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.520
I wore these skinny jeans.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.600
I don't know why I own these fucking idiot things.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.200
They make my butt look like a Cinnabon somebody sat on.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.640
I'm going to wear that too.

30:36.640 --> 30:37.360
Put all that on.

30:38.000 --> 30:38.960
Socks with holes in it.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.480
Yeah, absolutely.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.240
And then I'm going to wear dress shoes all day

30:42.240 --> 30:43.440
like a clown.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.720
So I'm going to wear all that

30:44.720 --> 30:45.680
and then I'm going to walk around

30:45.680 --> 30:46.880
and just like do my stuff

30:46.880 --> 30:49.760
like feeling uncomfortable the whole day.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.920
And then delay it.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.600
You got to delay your shit

30:53.600 --> 30:57.280
until you are about to literally pass out unconscious

30:57.280 --> 30:58.480
because of how sleepy you are.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.600
If you start to feel a little sleepy

30:59.600 --> 31:01.360
and you go for the nap, you're not going to hit it.

31:01.360 --> 31:01.840
Dope.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.720
You got to dive off this-

31:02.720 --> 31:03.920
You can overshoot that though.

31:03.920 --> 31:04.400
Be careful.

31:04.400 --> 31:04.640
Oh yeah.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.200
Cause if you-

31:05.200 --> 31:05.680
Yeah.

31:05.680 --> 31:06.560
Yeah, cause you will just-

31:06.560 --> 31:08.560
You got to learn where your point of no return is.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.040
Yeah.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.160
Like if you go to-

31:10.160 --> 31:12.720
I know that if it's past like 4.30 PM-

31:12.720 --> 31:13.280
Oh, don't see that.

31:13.280 --> 31:13.760
No, no, no, no.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.640
Don't nap after four.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.280
That's ridiculous.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.160
So yeah, you get so sleepy

31:18.160 --> 31:19.840
and you know you've hit your peak low

31:20.480 --> 31:22.640
and then go to the bedtime.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.360
You don't need any fucking special application

31:25.360 --> 31:28.640
voice telling you to kill vice president Joe Biden

31:28.640 --> 31:30.080
in your ear while you're asleep

31:30.080 --> 31:32.480
when you're at your most fucking psychically vulnerable.

31:32.480 --> 31:37.120
You don't have to like lower your fucking window shade

31:37.120 --> 31:40.160
made out of deer bones or whatever

31:40.160 --> 31:41.520
to begin the sacrament.

31:41.520 --> 31:44.400
No, you just take off your super uncomfortable clothes

31:44.400 --> 31:45.760
that you've been wearing all day

31:45.760 --> 31:47.280
that you put on in the morning in advance

31:47.280 --> 31:49.840
and then you feel amazing.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.240
And then you get in bed however you want,

31:52.240 --> 31:53.760
whatever bed, couch, floor.

31:53.760 --> 31:54.320
It doesn't matter.

31:54.320 --> 31:55.840
At that point, you're going to be so comfortable,

31:55.840 --> 31:57.440
so ready for beddy by time.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.480
And then you zonk out and then you-

32:00.480 --> 32:02.160
Oh, you have to have set an alarm

32:02.160 --> 32:03.520
because what they said about 25 minutes

32:03.520 --> 32:04.720
is also very important.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.560
But Griffin, you are so human being who,

32:06.560 --> 32:08.320
if I remember correctly from our youth,

32:08.320 --> 32:10.160
could sleep anywhere.

32:10.160 --> 32:10.400
Yeah.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.360
See, I have to trick myself.

32:13.360 --> 32:14.320
I have to trick myself.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.080
Well, you haven't tried my super tight clothes thing.

32:16.080 --> 32:16.560
Try it out.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.520
It's changed my life.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.320
So Griff, you agree with 25 minutes too?

32:20.960 --> 32:22.160
Yeah, it's gotta be 25 minutes.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.160
Any longer than that and you're-

32:24.160 --> 32:27.200
I have gone 45 and felt awesome.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.840
No, then it must have taken you a while to go to sleep because-

32:29.840 --> 32:30.560
That's what it is.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.640
If I know that my backwards falling back into it method

32:34.640 --> 32:36.160
isn't going to work right away,

32:36.160 --> 32:38.800
the secret to a good nap is falling asleep instantly.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.400
And I'm telling you this combo of waiting

32:40.400 --> 32:41.680
until you are at peak sleepiness

32:41.680 --> 32:44.160
and also you take off all your own comfy clothes.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.640
Oh boy, you'll be asleep before you hit the bed.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.560
Have somebody aim you.

32:48.560 --> 32:51.120
Have a friend there to aim your unconscious body

32:51.760 --> 32:53.600
as it plummets into dream zone.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.800
Fucking kicking it with Morpheus from the Matrix movies.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.520
Let's go to the-

32:57.520 --> 32:59.280
Swiggy, you go to the dream zone.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.640
I'm headed to the money zone.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.000
The money zone is my dream zone.

33:02.000 --> 33:13.360
Jokes on it.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.000
Hey guys, tell me what we're selling today.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.120
Well, Justin, it's 2016.

33:19.680 --> 33:19.920
Correct?

33:19.920 --> 33:20.960
Do you make resolutions?

33:20.960 --> 33:22.240
Do you have resolutions?

33:22.240 --> 33:23.520
I don't really do that.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.760
I just try to live a little better every day.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.680
I got a resolution and it's to sip

33:27.680 --> 33:34.480
fucking tasty, elegant cups of that good red stuff.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.560
Well, good news, Griffin.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.560
We've got sponsors gonna help you out.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.440
It's Blood Club.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.520
Oh no, oh no.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.800
Oh no, wait, I read that wrong.

33:42.800 --> 33:43.600
It's Club W.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.040
Club W is a wine subscription service.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.520
And let me tell you guys, I'm a big fan.

33:50.080 --> 33:50.800
Big old fan.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.880
Basically what it is is they have a series of questions

33:54.880 --> 33:57.840
that helps you determine what kind of wine you will like.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.120
You don't have to be an expert.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.560
You don't have to be a connoisseur.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.480
You don't have to be a sommelier.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.880
Maybe you're just like, you know, I kind of like sweet foods.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.560
You don't have to be a Somali pirate.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.080
You don't have to be Somali at all.

34:08.640 --> 34:10.080
You just have to know what you like.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.520
And then like you answer these questions

34:13.520 --> 34:15.840
and Club W recommends some wines

34:15.840 --> 34:17.680
and you're like, yeah, that sounds great.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.760
Let me get some of that good red stuff.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.120
And then they send it to you.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.960
It's a revolutionary new wine club.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.280
It sends the wine directly to your door.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.680
So you don't have to like go out to the grocery store

34:28.320 --> 34:29.840
and not only does it send the wine to your home,

34:29.840 --> 34:32.080
it sends you wine you love and the best part,

34:32.080 --> 34:34.320
my favorite part, along with the wine,

34:34.320 --> 34:37.600
you'll get these cards that tell you all about the wine.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.840
So if you pop it open with some friends,

34:39.840 --> 34:42.080
you can be like, oh yeah, this has notes of cinnamon

34:42.080 --> 34:43.520
and like earth and leather and whatever.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.960
And then all those friends will take turns

34:44.960 --> 34:46.000
punching you in the face.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.000
And it's just a big circle.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.680
That's going to happen regardless though.

34:49.680 --> 34:53.120
Yeah, but it also tells you what it will pair with

34:53.120 --> 34:56.240
and gives you recipes for examples of dishes

34:56.240 --> 34:57.360
you could possibly serve it with.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.920
We did this and the wine's not super expensive.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.200
Let me just jump right out and say that.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.080
No, it's way cheaper than you would get it in the store for.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.800
And not only that, right now Club W is offering

35:06.800 --> 35:08.160
my brother, my brother and me listeners

35:08.160 --> 35:10.160

They'll ship the bottles directly to your door.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.200
It's amazing.

35:21.200 --> 35:21.840
It's incredible.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.040
I'm a huge fan of the service.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.040
I want to read this next one because it is from

35:25.040 --> 35:26.320
good friends of the show.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.400
Me undies, me undies.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.560
What's the secret to New Year's resolutions?

35:30.560 --> 35:33.360
Fucking sexy soft underwear.

35:33.360 --> 35:33.680
Yes.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.320
That's something you have to do every day

35:36.320 --> 35:39.200
is put on underwear and in 2016,

35:39.200 --> 35:41.280
it's time to take all your old stupid underwear,

35:41.280 --> 35:44.880
throw it in the garbage and buy new me undies.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.480
The world's most comfortable underwear.

35:46.480 --> 35:51.200
Justin, my wife, Rachel, my loving wife,

35:51.200 --> 35:53.840
bought me those me undies lounge pants

35:53.840 --> 35:55.280
for the candle nights.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.000
Yeah.

35:56.000 --> 35:56.880
And my God.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.160
Yep.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.960
It's like all I want to wear.

36:00.960 --> 36:05.840
It is like a wearable angel soft circus tent.

36:05.840 --> 36:08.960
There's so much room to explore down in there

36:08.960 --> 36:12.000
and they're so soft and oh God.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.560
I want to be wearing them all the time.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.640
It's like they say in that song, huge basketball shorts,

36:16.640 --> 36:19.280
it's like a Bedouin group tent stitched with a belt.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.000
It's beautiful.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.600
If you head to meundies.com,

36:21.600 --> 36:24.480
you can choose from a variety of underwear styles

36:24.480 --> 36:27.040
in limited edition patterns, both for men and women,

36:27.040 --> 36:28.400
and they'll be delivered right to your door.

36:28.400 --> 36:32.000
You get matching pairs of underwears for you

36:32.000 --> 36:33.200
and a loved one or a family member.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.240
And that's fun.

36:34.240 --> 36:34.960
And that's fun.

36:34.960 --> 36:35.760
Not family member.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.880
I'm sorry I said family member.

36:36.880 --> 36:37.440
That sucks.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.000
Don't do that.

36:38.640 --> 36:38.960
Don't start out-

36:38.960 --> 36:40.640
Me and Griffin have lots of matching pairs.

36:40.640 --> 36:40.880
Right.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.640
Don't start your new year in old underwear.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.440
So important.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.800
Get your sexy right.

36:44.800 --> 36:45.600
Make a change.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.080
Head to meundies.com slash my brother right now

36:48.080 --> 36:50.080
and you can get 20% off your first order.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.480
Again, meundies.com slash my brother.

36:52.480 --> 36:53.680
Get yourself some new underwear.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.120
Think about that as lounge pants

36:55.120 --> 36:56.560
because they fucking changed my life.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.480
If I was a like a video game character

36:58.480 --> 37:01.360
and I had to wear the same outfit in like every scene

37:01.360 --> 37:03.360
for my whole life, it would be these lounge pants.

37:03.360 --> 37:06.240
And then on top, I would probably wear my,

37:07.440 --> 37:08.880
I don't know, nice polo.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.280
It's just like a nice tasteful collared shirt.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.640
Yeah, like a nice polo.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.480
And just dank ass lounge pants.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.360
Got some messages here from listeners.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.040
First up is from the Past Cast,

37:19.040 --> 37:23.440
a weekly podcast dedicated to discussing pop culture topics

37:23.440 --> 37:24.320
from the past.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.880
Each one focuses on a different theme

37:26.880 --> 37:30.000
as Rick and Ben talk about their experiences growing up.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.240
Episodes last roughly 45 minutes.

37:32.240 --> 37:32.960
I like that.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.640
I like no one I'll get it in for.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.160
And cover a broad range of categories

37:36.160 --> 37:39.440
including video games, books, television, movies,

37:39.440 --> 37:42.480
board games, fashion, music, and toys.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.080
New episodes are released each Monday.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.680
How dare you?

37:48.960 --> 37:49.920
Monday Funday.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.840
You're not part of the Monday Funday block.

37:51.840 --> 37:52.480
You could be though.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.400
The Monday Funday rock block is not.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.480
We'll talk to our people.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.000
We'll see if we can make room for you.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.920
I'll talk to my lawyer.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.080
Until we can get you in the Monday Funday rock block

38:02.080 --> 38:04.240
on an official stance, we're gonna need you to change.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.200
Thursday seems good.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.560
Nope, that's adventure zone day.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.920
You can do Sunday mornings.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.280
So visit the pastcast.com and you can listen and subscribe

38:11.280 --> 38:13.200
to Rick and Ben.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.800
It's only gonna take 45 minutes.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.000
That's half a nap.

38:16.000 --> 38:16.800
Or you got that.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.080
That's two naps almost.

38:18.880 --> 38:23.120
We also have a message for CJ and this is from Charlie and Goran.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.160
Or Goran.

38:24.160 --> 38:24.960
Or Goran.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.080
I prefer Goran.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.720
It makes it sound like Godzilla monster.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.220
Okay.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.440
We want to wish our dear friend CJ a happy, happy belated birthday.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.680
I wonder if that's what people call Godzilla.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.680
I said Godzilla monster.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.200
I said they're Godzilla monster.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.200
Shallowing down our house buildings.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.920
With his foot stompers.

38:45.920 --> 38:49.040
Hey, that's a Mr. Skyscraper Godzilla monster.

38:51.440 --> 38:53.440
CJ turned 27 in August.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.200
Just missed it.

38:55.200 --> 39:00.400
CJ is a giant vegetarian Japanese speaking ear of corn from Nebraska

39:00.400 --> 39:04.400
who has a cat named Bucket and enjoys a nice glass of Riesling.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.400
That all sounds pretty straightforward.

39:06.400 --> 39:11.920
Are you like going down a checklist of human characteristics?

39:11.920 --> 39:14.000
Like yes, yes, has a cat named Bucket.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.520
Okay, this all seems so right.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.200
This all seems legit so far.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.560
Seems like a person.

39:18.560 --> 39:22.080
We love you so much and please understand our lateness.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.000
We didn't have the idea till later.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.040
Let's get brunch soon.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.560
Like we've tried to tell you this so many times.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.880
You don't have to take the heat for being late.

39:30.880 --> 39:31.680
We'll take the heat.

39:31.680 --> 39:35.280
We'll take the heat but I think we can make an exception this time.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.480
Charlie and Goran.

39:36.480 --> 39:40.560
Because I think we're fucking closer to the next birthday

39:40.560 --> 39:43.200
than the birthday that you originally intended.

39:43.200 --> 39:47.040
You have almost fucking split the uprights of the year.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.280
Yeah, happy early 28th birthday.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.680
And late 27th.

39:51.680 --> 39:55.280
We planned it so it would be equidistant between the two dates.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.880
It's two birthdays in one.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.720
Like this is, you've reached the point of the year

39:58.720 --> 40:01.200
where CJ does not even remember whether or not they have birthdays.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.160
Wait, birthday, do I have those?

40:04.160 --> 40:05.920
I got caught, I guess I did.

40:05.920 --> 40:06.800
Huh, weird.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.680
So happy birthday CJ.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.040
Happy birthday.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.000
I'm Jesse Thorne.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.120
I'm Jordan Morris.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.520
The federal government has millions of dollars

40:15.520 --> 40:19.280
in programs and opportunities that you need to seize today.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.800
You're a taxpayer, right?

40:20.800 --> 40:22.320
Well then you've got it coming.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.240
Thanks to Uncle Sam, you can get grant programs for veterans.

40:26.240 --> 40:30.240
Postage stamps that'll ensure your mail gets there in a timely fashion.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.680
Fruit for you and your family.

40:31.680 --> 40:35.040
Child care for your children that turns them into super soldiers.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.680
Get a million dollars to open your own lake.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.440
Useful power tools that are easy on your soft, delicate hands.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.840
Your own personal radioactive brick.

40:43.840 --> 40:47.360
More sexual attention from everyone at the used bookstore.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.640
Greyhound tickets.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.920
Soft, gentle kisses from TV's John Goodman.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.200
A real narwhal.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.440
Athletic socks filled with stew.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.840
A valuable pamphlet on millet.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.760
Your father's approval.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.920
Don't wait right now.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.200
For all of this and more, drop us a line.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.560
Jordan, Jesse, go.

41:06.560 --> 41:11.680
123 iTunes Street or wherever you download podcasts.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.880
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

41:12.880 --> 41:13.360
Yep.

41:13.360 --> 41:13.600
Yes.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.200
Got a couple here.

41:15.920 --> 41:19.920
This one was sent in by game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

41:19.920 --> 41:20.720
Thank you, Rachel.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, question mark.

41:24.160 --> 41:28.400
Question mark only has 2% best answers, which I guess is better than 1%,

41:28.400 --> 41:32.400
but it sort of lets you know the bar of quality we're about to duck under.

41:33.040 --> 41:41.200
Question mark asks, if someone was to clone Barack Obama, could the clone run for president?

41:43.040 --> 41:43.760
Huh.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.120
Yeah, as a thinker.

41:47.200 --> 41:51.120
So this assumes the form of cloning that's like one and one,

41:51.120 --> 41:55.600
like another adult Barack Obama steps out of the other two.

41:55.600 --> 42:00.000
No, it's a half formed baby Barack Obama.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.680
But he can talk like regular Barack Obama.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.880
I want to be next president.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.960
Yeah, I think in that case he could.

42:10.960 --> 42:14.080
I'm the cool one.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.120
You're cool?

42:15.120 --> 42:17.520
Sorry, clone Barack, you sound-

42:20.160 --> 42:22.560
Make baby Obama president.

42:23.600 --> 42:24.320
Okay, okay.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.960
Help with flag pin.

42:28.640 --> 42:33.760
Throw flag pin into slime torso.

42:37.280 --> 42:42.320
Vote for me, hope and slime.

42:43.520 --> 42:48.080
Put nutrient sucker on baby.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.240
Pick me up, Robot Biden.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.880
Take me, Robot Biden.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.760
Put me in your stomach, Robot Biden.

42:55.760 --> 43:01.600
Put me in your stomach, Robot Biden.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.520
I'm Barack clone bomber.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.520
I have a mess.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.080
Put me in my nutrient bath.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.400
I think he stands a good chance.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.720
Constitution wouldn't have-

43:17.440 --> 43:19.040
Fuck all to say about it, right?

43:19.040 --> 43:20.400
Nature versus nurture, baby.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.560
Well, that's not what that means at all.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.280
That's in the constitution right next to the separation of church and state.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.920
Yep, and we do a pretty good job of following that one too.

43:31.200 --> 43:34.000
I do want to see that where they're flipping through the constitution like,

43:34.000 --> 43:35.840
it doesn't say anything in here, I guess.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.040
I guess we're good.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.000
I guess it's fine.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.280
We could do what we always do and just make shit up based on-

43:41.280 --> 43:46.960
We could take one word from article one and then 16 words from article three

43:46.960 --> 43:48.480
and just throw them all together.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.080
Is that an apostrophe or a fuck?

43:50.080 --> 43:52.160
Or a fucking ketchup stain?

43:52.160 --> 43:52.560
I don't know.

43:52.560 --> 43:53.760
Let's call it an apostrophe.

43:53.760 --> 43:54.640
Okay, we've changed it.

43:54.640 --> 43:55.440
No clones.

43:55.440 --> 43:59.600
We could continue on with our 200 year old sham of pretending that

44:00.640 --> 44:02.880
dudes who did not know what cell phones were,

44:03.680 --> 44:05.760
can make it through the rules for us.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.840
They have any idea how things are going to be going now.

44:08.400 --> 44:10.400
They didn't have any Twitter followers

44:10.400 --> 44:11.760
and they're trying to tell me how to live my life.

44:11.760 --> 44:14.160
Do you know how many followers GW had?

44:14.160 --> 44:15.840
By which I mean George Washington?

44:15.840 --> 44:16.640
None.

44:16.640 --> 44:17.040
Zero.

44:17.040 --> 44:17.360
None.

44:17.360 --> 44:20.560
None. GW was a fucking egg.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.520
He was an egg.

44:21.520 --> 44:22.400
None.

44:22.400 --> 44:22.880
None.

44:23.600 --> 44:24.000
All right.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.240
He didn't even have a Facebook fan page.

44:26.240 --> 44:26.800
No, he did not.

44:26.800 --> 44:35.120
Let us assume that this is one of those fucking multiplicity,

44:35.120 --> 44:39.840
which is basically we have exited the realm of sci-fi

44:39.840 --> 44:42.480
and entered the realm of Michael Keaton magic.

44:43.760 --> 44:45.760
It's a multiplicity clone chamber.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.040
Okay.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.520
And President Barack Hussein Obama,

44:49.520 --> 44:51.840
a lot of people like to omit that middle name.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.440
Griffin says it because it matters.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.640
Steps into that and another Barack Obama comes out,

45:00.640 --> 45:02.720
steps up to the podium,

45:02.720 --> 45:04.800
surprise guests at the next Democratic debate.

45:04.800 --> 45:05.920
He's like, got you suckers.

45:09.120 --> 45:14.080
I very much enjoy the reality in which we can't convince people

45:14.080 --> 45:21.120
that Barack Obama is not like a secret Kenyan Muslim from space.

45:21.120 --> 45:23.440
And yet we will be able to convince him that no,

45:23.440 --> 45:26.880
this person who looks exactly like him in every way

45:26.880 --> 45:28.240
is not actually him.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.840
It's a fucking double standard, isn't it?

45:29.840 --> 45:33.120
Because if Barack clone Obama can't run for president,

45:33.120 --> 45:38.720
then Jeb Bush, who is clearly a slime time fail clone of G-dubs,

45:39.680 --> 45:42.560
shouldn't be able to get up there.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.360
You know what I mean?

45:43.360 --> 45:47.840
What if clone Barack Obama took like a pivot?

45:47.840 --> 45:50.240
It was like, he just turned on the old one.

45:50.240 --> 45:54.880
Like, unlike that last Obama, I'm a real Christian, wink.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.880
And Obama was like, what the fuck?

45:57.520 --> 45:58.880
He's like, I don't know.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.720
I was cloned in America.

46:00.720 --> 46:01.760
I don't know what to tell you.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.600
I was cloned in America 15 minutes ago.

46:03.600 --> 46:06.320
And I do have my birth certificate.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.040
It's more of a stamp.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.640
It's kind of a barcode.

46:10.640 --> 46:12.720
It's like a stamp that a scientist drew.

46:12.720 --> 46:15.680
It's basically a barcode on the back of my head.

46:16.240 --> 46:18.960
So you can see, if you look at that barcode, scan it in.

46:18.960 --> 46:21.280
That's right, when you read it after you scan it in,

46:21.280 --> 46:22.960
it says Barack Hussein Obama,

46:22.960 --> 46:24.960
but then the Hussein has been scratched out.

46:24.960 --> 46:29.840
And instead it says Earl, the most American name.

46:29.840 --> 46:32.560
Barack Earl, that's too bad.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.560
I was gonna go with Barack to say Obama,

46:34.560 --> 46:36.240
the sequel to Barack Obama.

46:36.240 --> 46:37.200
I love sequels.

46:37.840 --> 46:38.080
Yeah.

46:38.080 --> 46:42.400
Yeah, I think that, so yeah, I guess.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.720
I don't see any reason why not.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.560
I think he'd do a killer job, right?

46:46.560 --> 46:47.760
Yeah, he'd crush it.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.160
I guess he would retain all the memories

46:50.160 --> 46:51.360
and experience of Barack Obama.

46:51.360 --> 47:00.560
Could we clone him now, but the clone would be eight years younger?

47:00.560 --> 47:01.600
You're saying it's upset.

47:01.600 --> 47:04.000
It's kind of a bummer to look at him now

47:04.000 --> 47:07.360
because it's like, homie, you aged like a billion years

47:07.360 --> 47:08.000
in the past eight years.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.400
What I'm saying, Griffin, is imagine a president, right?

47:10.400 --> 47:14.720
With the youth and vitality and springiness,

47:14.720 --> 47:17.040
his ability to leap from room to room

47:17.040 --> 47:19.280
that eight years ago Barack Obama had.

47:19.280 --> 47:22.240
But with all of the knowledge of how all this shit works

47:22.240 --> 47:23.520
and how to get shit done.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.640
Why just rewind to eight years?

47:24.640 --> 47:28.080
I wanna go way further back to fucking fresh ass Chicago Obama.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.680
That dude was the best, the best.

47:31.680 --> 47:35.200
I try to model myself and my life based on a single picture

47:35.200 --> 47:37.200
I saw once of Chicago Obama.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.160
And it was the freshest thing I've ever seen.

47:38.160 --> 47:42.400
He comes in smoking cigarettes and he just whips off his shades

47:42.400 --> 47:44.400
and he's like, I'm gonna fix this shit this time.

47:44.400 --> 47:47.040
He's dunking on Michael Jordan and Michael Jordan's clone.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.880
Like, we'll never get him.

47:48.880 --> 47:50.480
We can't stop Barack Obama.

47:51.120 --> 47:53.600
He's got all the knowledge of Barack old-Bama,

47:53.600 --> 47:56.000
but with all the youth and vitality of Barack young-Bama.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.880
Do you think if we clone Michael Jordan a dozen times,

48:00.720 --> 48:04.960
each one would go and master a different sport?

48:04.960 --> 48:05.440
Absolutely.

48:05.440 --> 48:10.960
MJ went on a baseball hiatus to explore.

48:12.400 --> 48:13.040
Conquered that.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.720
He did some baseball.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.680
He was the best at that.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.440
Everybody was like, all right, you did it.

48:17.440 --> 48:18.560
Please go back to basketball.

48:18.560 --> 48:19.680
You're making the rest of us look bad.

48:20.480 --> 48:21.920
But I think if we clone him a bunch,

48:21.920 --> 48:23.200
he would do that for every sport.

48:23.200 --> 48:25.120
Like hockey Jordan, golf Jordan.

48:27.040 --> 48:27.760
Football Jordan.

48:27.760 --> 48:28.320
Football Jordan.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.880
Oh, football Jordan, can you fucking imagine?

48:30.880 --> 48:32.960
He would be like the world's greatest wide receiver.

48:32.960 --> 48:33.760
Yeah, he would be.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.440
Because he would be on the fucking 50 yard line

48:35.440 --> 48:37.440
and he'd like jump to the end zone

48:37.440 --> 48:38.800
and stretch out like a cartoon

48:38.800 --> 48:41.280
because he still retains that space jam magic.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.280
Because he drank Michael's secret stuff.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.840
What would that movie be if he was football Jordan though?

48:46.560 --> 48:46.880
Football.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.480
Oh, because he couldn't call it space jam.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.040
Yeah.

48:49.040 --> 48:52.000
No, punting is not like jamming and punting

48:52.000 --> 48:56.080
are diametrically opposed in terms of like radical scale.

48:56.080 --> 48:56.560
Fair enough.

48:59.040 --> 48:59.680
Space Juke?

49:00.480 --> 49:02.160
Space Juke is fine.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.200
Space Down.

49:03.200 --> 49:03.840
Space Down.

49:04.560 --> 49:05.200
Space Down.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.720
It would be Space Down.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.480
The film Justin would be Space Down.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.160
Well, it works on a lot of levels

49:16.160 --> 49:18.400
because you get downs and you also get touchdowns.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.640
Yeah, and also you can like get down while dancing.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.720
So like, I'm sure the Quad City DJs-

49:22.720 --> 49:24.320
As you get tackled, you're taken down.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.800
The Quad City DJs can do something with this.

49:26.800 --> 49:29.120
I'm so glad, I see now in retrospect,

49:29.120 --> 49:31.600
I'm so glad I cloned the Quad City DJs

49:31.600 --> 49:33.440
into the Octuple City DJs.

49:33.440 --> 49:34.560
Oh, you made me do it.

49:34.560 --> 49:38.400
So we can, they can do this new song, Space Down.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.120
Oh my God, no, Justin, you left the cloner on.

49:41.120 --> 49:44.160
Dodeca City DJs, shut it down.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.560
They've taken up all available matter.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.320
The problem is if you clone 12 Michael Jordans, right?

49:50.320 --> 49:53.040
Statistically, one of them will be super evil.

49:53.040 --> 49:53.680
Oh, fuck.

49:54.320 --> 49:54.640
Right?

49:54.640 --> 49:57.200
Yeah, and nobody can stop him.

49:57.200 --> 49:58.560
No one can stop him.

49:58.560 --> 49:59.280
And the fucking-

49:59.280 --> 50:01.680
Except the other 11 Michael Jordans.

50:01.680 --> 50:02.080
Okay.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.560
We're just lucky, like we're just lucky

50:04.560 --> 50:06.320
he decided to basketball.

50:06.320 --> 50:09.280
Like if he had like walked into,

50:10.160 --> 50:11.440
like if his dad had been like,

50:11.440 --> 50:16.000
Michael, someday you're gonna be the greatest person puncher ever.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.080
And you're gonna be the king of strangling.

50:18.080 --> 50:20.000
You're gonna be the strangle king.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.400
No one will catch you and you'll strangle everybody.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.160
He would still be going door to door,

50:24.160 --> 50:25.440
like why can't we stop him?

50:26.320 --> 50:27.200
Someone please.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.320
Someone please.

50:28.320 --> 50:29.600
The police would have just given up.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.480
Everyone would just accept that you had like a one in six chance

50:32.480 --> 50:34.240
of being strangled by Michael Jordan.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.480
911, 911, he's here, he's here, he's here.

50:36.480 --> 50:37.040
Who's here?

50:37.040 --> 50:38.400
Michael Jordan, he's here to strangle me.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.280
Oh, that sucks.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.000
That's right.

50:40.000 --> 50:40.400
Sorry.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.040
You had a good run.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.480
Can you send the cops or something?

50:42.480 --> 50:44.880
Oh yeah, we never thought of that before.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.600
Hey cops, you guys want to go stop Michael Jordan

50:47.600 --> 50:48.720
from strangling this guy?

50:48.720 --> 50:49.600
Yeah, they can't.

50:49.600 --> 50:50.960
They can't stop number 23.

50:50.960 --> 50:51.760
Good luck.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.200
That's right, he's still number 23

50:53.200 --> 50:55.120
because he's got a strangle jersey, idiot.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.640
I'm glad you're dying today.

50:56.640 --> 50:59.040
Hi, it's me, Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.760
I have an announcement to all the citizens of Chicago.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.520
Michael's coming.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.640
He's coming for you.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.240
And there's nothing we can do about it.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.880
Everybody get up.

51:08.880 --> 51:10.640
It's time to strangle.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.080
We've got a real thing.

51:12.080 --> 51:12.960
Crangle.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.480
Welcome to the space.

51:14.480 --> 51:15.120
You okay?

51:15.120 --> 51:16.400
Michael Jordan got to him.

51:17.680 --> 51:18.800
Why didn't he strangle me?

51:19.520 --> 51:21.200
Why didn't he strangle me?

51:21.200 --> 51:22.160
This is the end of the show.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.880
That's the last thing we talked about on the show.

51:24.880 --> 51:28.640
So until this, when I said thanks again to MeUndies

51:28.640 --> 51:30.800
who are dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear,

51:30.800 --> 51:32.640
go to meundies.com slash my brother

51:32.640 --> 51:34.960
and you can get 20% off your first order.

51:37.280 --> 51:37.680
Nice.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.040
Justin, you did that real good.

51:39.040 --> 51:39.280
Thanks.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.800
It sounded like a real professional.

51:41.360 --> 51:42.800
Yeah, you really nailed it.

51:42.800 --> 51:43.200
I did.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.280
I think I did way better than Justin would have.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.440
Wait a minute.

51:47.440 --> 51:56.800
I mean, oh, I mean, I'm glad I did a good job.

51:56.800 --> 51:57.840
Glad I did a good job.

51:58.640 --> 52:00.080
Wait, are you a robot or a clone?

52:00.640 --> 52:02.560
Well, we've been talking about clones all episode.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.920
I know, but you stuttered like a robot.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.880
What would be the thematic consistency of me being a robot?

52:06.880 --> 52:09.120
Hey, Justin, don't part the kimono right now, okay?

52:09.120 --> 52:11.680
Listen, I'll pop whatever cherries.

52:13.600 --> 52:14.720
I'm in hell.

52:14.720 --> 52:15.760
I can't reclaim it.

52:15.760 --> 52:16.640
I can't reclaim it.

52:16.640 --> 52:17.760
It has to stay where it is.

52:18.320 --> 52:20.000
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winter.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.760
She sort of theme song into departure off the album,

52:21.760 --> 52:22.720
putting the days to bed.

52:24.480 --> 52:25.760
It's a good album.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.840
And I hope a lot of you guys got it for candle nights

52:27.840 --> 52:32.480
and listen to it nonstop because that's what I do every day.

52:32.480 --> 52:34.640
I listened to the album front to back twice.

52:35.440 --> 52:36.960
Takes up a lot of time out of my day.

52:36.960 --> 52:38.640
Yeah, but it's worth it.

52:38.640 --> 52:40.800
I want to say thank you to everybody who chipped in

52:40.800 --> 52:43.200
and helped out on the my brother,

52:43.200 --> 52:44.720
my brother and me appreciation group.

52:44.720 --> 52:50.400
We had our annual charity drive called NBNBA Angels

52:50.400 --> 52:52.240
where we help out people in Huntington, West Virginia.

52:52.960 --> 52:56.720
And it was a stunning response.

52:56.720 --> 53:00.000
Hundreds, like literally hundreds of people here

53:00.000 --> 53:02.400
in West Virginia and specifically Huntington

53:02.400 --> 53:07.760
and the surrounding area had more of a Christmas

53:07.760 --> 53:10.640
because the people in our appreciation group

53:10.640 --> 53:12.080
are dope as hell.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.120
So dope.

53:13.120 --> 53:16.400
So dope, have you been following the secret Santa stuff

53:16.400 --> 53:17.120
they did for each other?

53:17.120 --> 53:20.480
It's like a secret, a self-organized secret Santa trade-off

53:20.480 --> 53:21.120
that's going on.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.560
And the gifts that people are getting each other

53:22.560 --> 53:23.840
are like insane.

53:23.840 --> 53:25.200
They're so wonderful.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.040
Like they're almost all like handmade,

53:27.040 --> 53:30.080
great, jokey, fun, awesome gifts.

53:30.080 --> 53:32.400
And that group fills me with life.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.560
You should, yeah, that groups that it's called

53:34.560 --> 53:36.160
the my brother, my brother and me appreciation group.

53:37.200 --> 53:39.760
We have 303 people who are waiting to get in.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.760
So maybe we could start sorting through those.

53:41.760 --> 53:42.880
Yeah, we should probably take care of that.

53:42.880 --> 53:44.560
Well, I don't trust fucking Travis to do it

53:44.560 --> 53:48.800
because then it's like, oh, hi, my name is Carolyn Goodboobs

53:48.800 --> 53:50.480
and I'm in a billion groups

53:50.480 --> 53:52.400
and I just joined Facebook a minute ago.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.320
And Travis is like, yep, sounds good.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.720
Welcome to the club, Goodboobs.

53:57.520 --> 53:58.080
You want to buy some cheese?

53:58.080 --> 54:02.880
The last time you chastised me, I've gotten very precise

54:02.880 --> 54:06.160
and I search and I do it and that's what's taking so long.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.480
You can, if you join our group, you can also see

54:08.480 --> 54:12.080
Hamilton composer Lin-Manuel Miranda troll Griffin

54:12.080 --> 54:15.840
with pictures of gold dust just in the opportune moments.

54:15.840 --> 54:17.360
That fool hit me on Twitter too.

54:17.360 --> 54:20.400
And it's like, it made me double afraid.

54:20.400 --> 54:22.720
Like I'm gonna open up Snapchat and it'll be like,

54:22.720 --> 54:25.360
hey, Snapchat waiting for me from gold dust

54:25.360 --> 54:27.200
and fucking Lin gave him my number or something.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.400
And then no one will fucking believe me

54:32.400 --> 54:33.920
because this is a Snapchat and it's gone.

54:34.880 --> 54:35.760
Oh, gold dust.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.160
Anyway, that's our Facebook group.

54:38.160 --> 54:41.040
We're on Twitter, we're at MB, MBAM.

54:41.040 --> 54:44.320
We haven't mentioned a while, but maybe go to iTunes

54:44.320 --> 54:46.640
and give us like a rating or review.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.560
That's super helpful if you like the show.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.160
It's the least you could do.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.080
And maybe tell a friend.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.600
Maybe tell a friend just this once.

54:53.600 --> 54:56.160
2016 is gonna be a good year to tell a friend

54:56.160 --> 54:57.600
to listen to my brother, my brother and me

54:57.600 --> 55:01.200
and tweet with the hashtag, hashtag MB, MBAM,

55:01.200 --> 55:01.760
that kind of thing.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.760
I want to say in response to our decision

55:05.760 --> 55:09.280
to claim that 2016 is 2016, building bridges,

55:09.280 --> 55:10.800
we got a lot of people.

55:10.800 --> 55:14.400
A lot of people, a lot of kibitzing with that.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.320
And a lot of the theme of that kibitz,

55:16.320 --> 55:17.920
a lot of stuff I'm seeing is like,

55:17.920 --> 55:20.000
I can't believe you guys didn't think of blank.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.120
But more importantly, a lot of it is,

55:21.120 --> 55:23.440
I can't believe you didn't think of like 20 tricks team

55:23.440 --> 55:24.560
continue the con.

55:24.560 --> 55:26.800
And it's like the fact that you thought we should do that

55:26.800 --> 55:30.560
is exactly why it is so important that this is 2016

55:30.560 --> 55:32.720
building bridges because it's time for us

55:32.720 --> 55:34.400
to do some selfless shit for each other

55:34.400 --> 55:36.400
and help put this shit back together.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.800
Because guys look around you, it's falling apart.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.640
Yep, it's falling apart.

55:40.640 --> 55:41.120
We need to fix it.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.480
We're the only ones who can do this.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.400
But anyway, thanks for listening to the show.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.600
We love you very much.

55:47.600 --> 55:49.360
Hey, go listen to the other MaxFun shows,

55:49.360 --> 55:51.280
the other shows on the MaxFun network.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.200
There's lots of so many amazing programs

55:53.200 --> 55:56.400
like the Flophouse and Stop Podcasting Yourself

55:56.400 --> 55:59.200
and Lady to Lady and Can I Pet Your Dog.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.840
And you should go check out Oh No Ross and Carrie.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.080
They've got some very special stuff coming up

56:04.080 --> 56:05.040
in the next couple of months.

56:05.040 --> 56:06.800
And I think everybody's really going to dig it.

56:06.800 --> 56:09.840
So start listening now and rare up to it.

56:09.840 --> 56:12.000
I want to do a special plug for the Adventure Zone.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.760
It's a podcast that the three of us do with our dad

56:13.760 --> 56:15.440
where we play Dungeons and Dragons.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.040
And I'm real proud of it.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.320
And if you haven't listened

56:18.320 --> 56:20.400
because it is all about Dungeons and Dragons,

56:20.400 --> 56:22.720
I promise you we don't actually play that much Dungeons

56:22.720 --> 56:23.600
and Dragons in it.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.080
We mostly just make shit up.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.400
And it's sort of like a communal

56:28.400 --> 56:31.440
like fucking psychic storytelling adventure.

56:31.440 --> 56:34.080
I was trying to figure out how many spells I should know.

56:34.080 --> 56:37.600
I started reading the rules theoretically

56:37.600 --> 56:39.680
for how was it supposed to work.

56:39.680 --> 56:44.800
Wow, it is a liberal, a liberal take on that, huh?

56:44.800 --> 56:47.280
We are off book, so to speak.

56:47.280 --> 56:49.200
And the book is the Player's Handbook, fifth edition.

56:49.200 --> 56:50.320
Anyway, the Adventure Zone.

56:50.320 --> 56:53.360
Go listen to it and Sawbones and Bunker Buddies.

56:54.880 --> 56:55.600
Can I Pet Your Dog?

56:55.600 --> 56:56.240
Can I Pet Your Dog.

56:56.240 --> 56:57.040
I already plugged that one.

56:57.040 --> 56:57.680
Nice try.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.480
Oh, sorry.

56:59.360 --> 57:00.720
And I'm working on a new one

57:00.720 --> 57:02.720
that should be coming up pretty soon.

57:02.720 --> 57:05.520
Yep, but I think everyone's really gonna take.

57:05.520 --> 57:07.440
Yeah, yeah.

57:08.160 --> 57:10.320
Can you fucking focus?

57:10.960 --> 57:12.480
I don't do anything else.

57:12.480 --> 57:13.280
I guess that's true.

57:14.160 --> 57:16.720
I was laying around with 102 degree fever

57:16.720 --> 57:18.400
and in a fever dream, I woke up and went,

57:18.400 --> 57:19.440
oh, new podcast.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.240
Cherry Pop and Daddy's Fan Cast.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.560
Honey, honey, give me a pen and paper right now, quick.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.240
I've solved it.

57:28.960 --> 57:30.160
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

57:30.160 --> 57:30.800
Yeah, please.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.920
Please.

57:31.920 --> 57:35.120
Can I read a question and also the description of it?

57:35.680 --> 57:38.560
I know this is unorthodox, but it made me laugh really hard.

57:38.560 --> 57:39.280
Sure.

57:39.280 --> 57:42.640
It's by, sent in by level 9000 Yajuru Drew Davenport.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.520
Thank you, Drew.

57:43.520 --> 57:45.760
It's by Yajuru Answers user Ducky who asks,

57:47.360 --> 57:48.880
are potato guns deadly?

57:50.400 --> 57:52.480
I built a handheld spud musket.

57:52.480 --> 57:54.640
I know it hits pretty hard because it made a dent

57:54.640 --> 57:56.480
the size of a Buick in our hay barn,

57:56.480 --> 57:59.200
but my grandson is a sleeping late again.

57:59.200 --> 58:01.520
I was thinking a good Christmas prank would be

58:01.520 --> 58:04.000
to wake him up with a blast to the face.

58:04.000 --> 58:04.800
Oh, God.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.040
I just don't want the blessed goof to die.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.800
I just want to rattle his cage a bit.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.480
Fucking grandpa rules.

58:14.000 --> 58:14.480
That's good.

58:14.480 --> 58:15.280
Your update.

58:15.280 --> 58:15.840
Oh, no.

58:15.840 --> 58:16.800
Oh, God.

58:16.800 --> 58:17.760
The blessed goof.

58:18.720 --> 58:20.320
The blessed goof is down.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.200
Thanks.

58:23.200 --> 58:24.160
What do I say?

58:24.160 --> 58:25.200
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.480
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:27.040 --> 58:27.840
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:27.840 --> 58:30.480
I'm my brother, my brother, me, because your dad's square on the lips.

58:47.360 --> 58:49.280
Maximumfun.org.

58:49.280 --> 58:50.320
Comedy and culture.

58:50.320 --> 58:51.440
Artist-owned.

58:51.440 --> 58:52.480
Listener-supported.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.000
Welcome to Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

58:56.000 --> 58:56.480
Ross.

58:56.480 --> 58:57.040
Hi, Carrie.

58:57.040 --> 58:58.720
What do you think is creepier?

58:58.720 --> 58:59.200
OK.

58:59.200 --> 59:01.840
You jump into a swimming pool.

59:01.840 --> 59:03.760
All of a sudden, the water goes away.

59:03.760 --> 59:08.080
And instead of water, there is the bones of your dead ancestors.

59:08.080 --> 59:08.640
Ew.

59:08.640 --> 59:10.240
Or our show.

59:10.240 --> 59:13.760
That's pretty tough, because we visited a live exorcism.

59:13.760 --> 59:17.520
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis, where we had to worship a naked lady.

59:17.520 --> 59:19.440
Oh, and we joined that Tony Olomo cult.

59:19.440 --> 59:20.320
They were scary.

59:20.320 --> 59:21.040
Super creepy.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.560
We joined the Ethere Society.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.880
We tried penis enlargement, or at least I did.

59:24.880 --> 59:25.200
Oh, boy.

59:25.200 --> 59:26.400
I tried breast enlargement.

59:26.400 --> 59:32.480
We have basically done every creepy, weird, fringe thing, except for thousands more, which

59:32.480 --> 59:34.160
we will get to if you listen to our show.

59:34.160 --> 59:36.880
I'd still say the swimming pool of my ancestors' bones.

59:36.880 --> 59:38.560
Well, then I don't even know if people should listen.

59:38.560 --> 59:39.440
I guess they shouldn't.

59:39.440 --> 59:56.960
But if you want to, we're at Maximum Fun, and the show's called Anna, Ross, and Carrie.
