WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.640
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm live from the floor of the Republican National Convention,

00:50.640 --> 00:56.560
and Griffin, I understand that you just got back from Mexico. I couldn't decide which one to do.

00:56.560 --> 01:01.600
I did both. We gotta use a fisherman's knot to weave these two things together.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.000
I just, I couldn't pick one to do, so I did them both that we said.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.200
Okay, here it is. I've got it. Okay. Ready? I just saw a headline that says the GOP is now

01:11.200 --> 01:16.960
going after women and Latinos. Okay. Griffin. Yeah, there was a-

01:16.960 --> 01:18.960
Mexico. Let me tell you.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.760
So now my brother, my brother and me is going after Latinos.

01:21.760 --> 01:28.240
Now, Griffin, I understand that you actually had a stipulation that you would only be exposed to

01:28.240 --> 01:33.680
other Caucasians. That was the one rule in your travel. You were actually traveling from one

01:33.680 --> 01:36.480
Caucasian bubble to another. That is true.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.720
And being blindfolded in between. Is that accurate?

01:38.720 --> 01:44.640
It's not blindfolding. It's a blinders system. It's a pair of goggles. They call it white vision.

01:44.640 --> 01:49.760
It's complicated because they put these blinders on you, and then each hallway that you walk down

01:49.760 --> 01:54.400
in the resort has special lanes. Okay.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.640
That you walk down. So the blinders shut out the far left and right lanes,

01:58.640 --> 02:05.680
which really saves you from a lot of hassle vis-a-vis non-whites.

02:06.240 --> 02:11.040
Which is very much how the Republicans may view the world.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.880
Okay. This is good.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.400
This is good. This is political and international. It's just-

02:16.400 --> 02:21.440
I'll be the footnotes at the bottom of the queue to pull it back to a Republican National

02:21.440 --> 02:22.240
Convention.

02:22.240 --> 02:27.840
I'll tell you this much. When I was sitting on those silky alabaster beaches,

02:28.640 --> 02:34.240
contemplating the ocean, as I do, I can't tell you how many Romney coladas I had down there.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.240
If you like Romney coladas-

02:38.240 --> 02:38.560
You know what?

02:38.560 --> 02:39.840
Do you know what goes into a Romney colada?

02:39.840 --> 02:42.400
They're very refreshing, but they're each $12,000.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.000
Each?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.560
To me seems overzealous.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.680
Instead of making you drunk, it makes you just kind of boring.

02:50.640 --> 02:51.680
Just a little sleepy.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.280
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.520
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

02:59.520 --> 03:06.400
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I don't feel good about how we did that.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.120
Did we get good jobs?

03:09.120 --> 03:10.560
I don't think we did good jobs, no.

03:10.560 --> 03:17.120
Griffin, the one thing that you should have learned from Mexico is no regrets, you know?

03:17.840 --> 03:20.080
Which is also the Romney campaign slogan.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.680
No regrets.

03:21.680 --> 03:21.920
Full speed ahead.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.600
Never look back. Romney, 2012.

03:23.600 --> 03:28.320
Fuck it. Fuck it. It's like my 12th time trying this. I have nothing left to lose.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.640
You want to see my taxes? I want to see the future.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.000
Why is everybody- Why are you in the past?

03:35.200 --> 03:37.920
I want to talk about how much money I'm going to make next year.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.680
I'm going forward, which is why I've hired a baby to be my vice president.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.440
Come on, baby. We're going to the future. Come on, baby VP.

03:47.040 --> 03:51.280
Baby VP. Okay, how would you not vote?

03:51.280 --> 03:54.560
I think I would- I don't agree with Mr. Romney's politics.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.360
If he did put a baby on the ticket, I would be-

03:57.360 --> 04:00.720
What if he actually showed the baby, like, sitting on the ticket, sitting on a ticket?

04:00.720 --> 04:03.120
And you did, like, Romney was at his podium,

04:03.120 --> 04:05.920
and then you had, like, a small baby podium next to it,

04:05.920 --> 04:09.440
then you put a baby dressed like Mitt Romney with a Mitt Romney wig on.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.720
And he's wearing a toupee.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.240
I would vote for that. Hey, Romney, if you're listening, you're welcome.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.520
Just imagine that VP debate, too, right?

04:19.520 --> 04:22.800
Because you would have our VP whose name escapes me.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.280
His what? Sorry?

04:25.280 --> 04:27.120
His name escapes me at the moment.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.880
Oh, man. You know.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.100
Joey B.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.400
You know the guy?

04:34.400 --> 04:35.280
Joey B.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.920
Joey- Joey Bag of Donuts is up there.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.960
Oh, Joey Bag of Donuts, eh?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.400
He's doing his thing up there.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.920
I can't remember the goddamn vice president's name.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.560
I've been out of the country more days than I've been in the country this-

04:48.560 --> 04:50.960
Don't you have to take a test to get back into the country?

04:52.800 --> 04:54.560
This is hugely embarrassing.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.320
I'm pretty sure it's Joey Flip.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.360
Is it not Joey Flip?

04:58.320 --> 04:59.200
Flip Wilson?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.320
Flip Wilson?

05:00.320 --> 05:03.600
Vice president and known cross-dresser, Flip Wilson.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.240
Okay, I want to see a VP debate with Joe- Joseph Gordon-Biden.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.760
Yo, he was so good on Third Rock from the Sun.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.480
I love his work in Brick.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.200
I want him up there. I want a baby up there.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.080
And one of them is going to poop his pants, but the other one is going to say

05:22.800 --> 05:27.040
something offensive accidentally about the gay community.

05:27.040 --> 05:27.920
And it's going to be great.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.840
Which one was which? I don't know.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.040
It could really go either way.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.680
He pays your money, he takes your chances.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.960
Let's get into the advice.

05:34.960 --> 05:39.440
I just forgot the vice president's fucking name for two and a half minutes.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.840
You're not even like an American anymore, really.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.240
I peeled.

05:45.600 --> 05:52.720
I peeled a layer of skin from my elbow to my fingers like a lady's delicate glove.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.560
Why are you taking me on this journey right now?

05:54.560 --> 05:57.440
And that skin contain your memories of Joe Biden?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.080
Possibly.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.960
This is the part of me that remembers Joe Biden.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.080
This is my Derma Biden Titus.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.520
And this is the part of the Derma layer in which Biden.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.560
I tell you guys what, one time I had Biden Titus.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.080
I had to have my Biden removed.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.560
But you know what?

06:14.560 --> 06:16.720
Travis is still living the life he wants.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.920
He doesn't need no Biden.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.120
That's right.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.000
Nor no man, because he is strong and proud.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.360
A few months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of 1.5 years and friend of 10 years

06:27.360 --> 06:31.440
because I had a strong feeling that I am gay instead of just bisexual.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.320
However, a couple of months past the breakup,

06:34.320 --> 06:37.600
I realized that instead of not being attracted to all men ever,

06:37.600 --> 06:42.560
I was just not a drink, not just not attracted to his lazy ass anymore.

06:42.560 --> 06:42.960
Okay.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.200
My question is, if I start to date a new guy,

06:47.200 --> 06:51.440
my ex slash friend is definitely going to bring up the whole being gay thing.

06:52.240 --> 06:52.720
Got it.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.080
How should I tell him the truth without completely crushing his soul?

06:56.080 --> 06:57.600
Why are you laughing at this?

06:57.600 --> 07:03.040
A confused lady in need, because here's the only thing about it,

07:03.040 --> 07:05.760
is that you can never talk to him again.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.080
Yeah.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.480
He can't ever, ever, ever know.

07:08.480 --> 07:08.720
Right.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.240
You can't ever talk to him again.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.400
He has to go to his grave thinking that it was a misunderstanding.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.040
Now, this is also a rare week in which Justin has put together the question list.

07:19.920 --> 07:25.120
And I did not know until the end of the question that it was a lady.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.240
And I thought that this was a dude who broke up with his dude boyfriend

07:28.240 --> 07:31.440
because he thought he was bisexual instead of like full gay.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.400
And I was really confused by the premise.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
Are you dyslexic?

07:34.400 --> 07:35.200
Yes.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.280
I hadn't read the question list until this.

07:37.280 --> 07:42.080
Travis is actually dyssexic, which is where he confuses genders and sexualities.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.160
No sex per here.

07:44.160 --> 07:48.320
I think that it is, I think you are doing your ex a disservice

07:48.320 --> 07:50.720
if when he's like, what the fuck?

07:50.720 --> 07:55.280
If you're not like, oh, no, no, you're really unattractive right now.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.520
You are living an unattractive lifestyle.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.680
As it turns out, you are the bits.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.040
You are the bits.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.800
You are a stinker.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.280
And I don't want to be with you no more.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.480
Listen, it turns out I am not I am not full blown gay.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.280
And for that, that mistruth, I apologize.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.560
I was confused at the time.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.160
I wasn't quite possibly sure.

08:14.160 --> 08:20.880
Now I would define my sexuality as everything but Mike.

08:24.880 --> 08:30.320
You know when you order an antipasta and you expect it to be a plate full of everything

08:30.320 --> 08:31.680
ever cooked except for pasta.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.680
You want some Skittles in there.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.800
You want a hamburger.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.840
You want a hamburger.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.560
Some fondue.

08:37.120 --> 08:37.440
Right.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.480
It's like when you order a hamburger, sometimes it's just easier.

08:40.480 --> 08:45.280
It's like I want it with everything except Mike.

08:45.280 --> 08:45.840
Can you imagine?

08:45.840 --> 08:50.720
But that would that would that would be predicated upon there being a sexuality out there.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.760
That's just like Mike sexual.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.640
I want Mike.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.320
And that's all I can think about.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.640
But this is this is the world we live in, right?

08:58.640 --> 09:03.200
There's there is a there is a polar opposite for every person.

09:03.200 --> 09:12.240
So the good news is that although me myself am an anti Mike aficionado, I like everything

09:12.240 --> 09:21.280
but you somewhere out there is a micro sexual that just wants to get it done, you know,

09:21.280 --> 09:23.280
with Mike, with you specifically, Mike.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.960
If you could back away from the door, I am feeling a little uncomfortable by how close

09:28.960 --> 09:29.440
you've gotten.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.600
Oh, man.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.840
Oh, boy.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.240
I would also like to be in Mike's shoes in that moment when you walk in with your new

09:38.240 --> 09:42.960
boyfriend and he just double takes like what what what?

09:42.960 --> 09:44.400
Oh, no.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.680
You could you could go.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.320
You know what?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
Gender roles are very loose right now.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.840
You could insist that to your ex that the man you're dating is a woman.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.280
I don't think he's going to get in there for a look.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.320
That dog.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.520
That dog won't hunt.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.640
That dog will not hunt.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.840
That dog has no legs.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.640
That dog does not.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.920
That dog can roll around.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.600
He can bark.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.880
I guess I guess I guess the reason you asked me why I was laughing earlier and I I don't

10:08.880 --> 10:11.440
mean to mock the pain of of others.

10:11.440 --> 10:23.920
I I just can't imagine what it must feel like to date someone and they they say not I dislike

10:23.920 --> 10:25.440
being in this so much.

10:25.440 --> 10:30.640
I think that I don't want to be with an entire one half of the world.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.320
I am writing off half of the world's population because of the extent to which you have repulsed

10:36.320 --> 10:41.680
me and like that's never the case in these situations because typically I would imagine

10:41.680 --> 10:45.840
if someone realizes that they're they are gay and they have to leave a heterosexual

10:45.840 --> 10:50.800
relationship that's that's almost always the case.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.840
And I would imagine it's very difficult for both parties.

10:53.840 --> 10:58.960
This is that rare instance where the parents are getting divorced and it is in fact because

10:58.960 --> 11:00.560
of something the child did.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.480
No, it's that rare anomaly.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.040
I can't.

11:03.040 --> 11:09.200
OK, I can't pretend to understand what it's like to be in this situation on either side

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
of it because I've never been on either side of it.

11:11.200 --> 11:17.280
But I can't believe that you come to that realization because of one because of of one

11:17.280 --> 11:18.720
person because of one relationship.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.160
No, no, I get what Justin's saying.

11:20.160 --> 11:25.760
What I think what Justin's saying is that you don't say, oh, I'm gay because of this

11:25.760 --> 11:26.720
one person.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.920
But to say, am I gay because I'm not attracted to this person anymore?

11:29.920 --> 11:33.040
And then realize, oh, no, no, no, it's totally cool.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.080
It's not everyone else.

11:34.080 --> 11:34.720
It's them.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.220
Right.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.320
Right.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.720
I'm saying I don't know.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.480
It seems like that's again, I can't pretend to understand, but it seems unlikely to think

11:42.480 --> 11:44.720
like, well, I've had Mike.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.240
So like, that's all the guys.

11:46.240 --> 11:50.720
I don't think that's I think that it's probably indicative of a lot of things.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.040
It does explain his T-shirt.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.200
Once you go, Mike, there's no more like I understand that now.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.160
Travis, you didn't quite nail the dismount.

12:00.160 --> 12:04.240
The Russian judge has generously given you an 8.5, so you are going to go home with a

12:04.240 --> 12:05.040
bronze.

12:05.040 --> 12:05.440
Thank you.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.080
Olympics.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.080
It's a theme show.

12:10.080 --> 12:15.760
You know, I OK, so as far as how how to.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.760
Oh, man, you don't know.

12:17.760 --> 12:21.040
No, listen, no, listen, because this is this is serious because this is a person you've

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
known for 10 years and is obviously right.

12:23.040 --> 12:27.120
I'm trying to shepherd a good bud, but not like a Dayton bud.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.720
And here's the thing.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.800
You don't know this person fucking check shit because you're finding yourself finding your

12:32.800 --> 12:37.200
sexuality and your needs and your desires and what gets what gets off your rocks.

12:37.200 --> 12:43.840
And if explain it to him exactly like that, just say you're not what does it for me anymore?

12:44.320 --> 12:46.000
You don't get my motor rep.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.800
And I thought that was indicative of all the guys.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.800
But now I've just realized that it's not because of all the guys is Mike.

12:52.800 --> 13:00.400
And I would actually take a moment to think about whether or not it was completely just

13:00.400 --> 13:05.280
your repulsion with Mike that put you off of men forever or if maybe if you're being

13:05.280 --> 13:10.400
100 percent honest with yourself, if there wasn't some part of you that thought, gosh,

13:10.400 --> 13:15.120
if I was, it would be such a make this a lot.

13:15.120 --> 13:18.880
It would make this so much easier because a lot of times your brain is going to hear

13:18.880 --> 13:21.760
you thinking that and it's going to bridge that gap for you because your brain wants

13:21.760 --> 13:23.600
to avoid bad situations.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.320
And you know what?

13:24.320 --> 13:28.800
Even if that's not the case, even if I'm full of shit, that's a pretty good thing to tell

13:28.800 --> 13:29.300
Mike.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.000
That's a good out.

13:32.000 --> 13:32.880
That's a good out.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.440
Like, I know you're into excuses.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.240
Get out of it.

13:36.240 --> 13:41.760
You know, I have to look at this as there's also a little bit of you hear it all the time

13:41.760 --> 13:46.160
where people say, like, you know, once they break up with someone, they say, I just don't

13:46.160 --> 13:48.880
want to be with anyone right now.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.720
I just want to be by myself right now.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.160
So I think that this is a pretty common feeling that maybe is just.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.880
Oh, that's all that is all horseshit, though, right?

13:58.640 --> 13:59.600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.120
That's what I think until the moment when they realize that that's not true, they just

14:03.120 --> 14:04.560
don't want to be with that person.

14:04.560 --> 14:04.800
Right.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.440
That's what I'm saying.

14:05.440 --> 14:11.680
So I think that this is just set in a different frame, but a pretty common feeling, you know,

14:11.680 --> 14:13.920
I just want to be single right now.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.160
But you don't really just don't want to be with that person.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.160
I don't know.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.280
We're out of our depth.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.480
Just just be honest.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.200
You don't know this person or a lot or use that lie.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.360
I told you about the lie is also good.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.400
How about a Yahoo?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.200
Please do it.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.640
This one was sent by Steven Ketchum.

14:28.640 --> 14:29.440
Thank you, Steven.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.080
Ketchum, Ash Ketchum's brother.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Milan, who asks.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.440
How are some people able to get a lot of likes on Facebook?

14:41.440 --> 14:42.880
10 points for the best answer.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.560
There is this guy who I know on Facebook.

14:46.560 --> 14:52.000
We're in college who can post something and often gets 20 plus likes on most of his posts.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I know people say it depends on how many friends you have, but that's not always true because

14:56.000 --> 14:58.400
we both have the same number of Facebook friends.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.840
900.

14:59.840 --> 15:05.440
But I barely get 10 likes on my status where he can easily pull off 40 likes on a really

15:05.440 --> 15:06.960
good status of his.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.720
He's not one of those attention seekers.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.120
He doesn't get post every 10 minutes.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.120
It seems to be only two to three times a week.

15:13.120 --> 15:16.080
But when he posts, it's like people stop to read what he writes.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.920
This guy's like Facebook Martin Luther King Jr.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.440
I know it's just listening to his shit.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.520
I know it's just Facebook, but it baffles me.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.680
How do some people just natural?

15:29.680 --> 15:33.840
I guess you would call it Internet popularity more than some others do.

15:36.400 --> 15:41.360
Can you imagine if you had a baby and like it just turned out he was a prodigy at posting

15:41.360 --> 15:42.160
on Facebook?

15:42.960 --> 15:48.320
He's the he has one talent and that is he's the one he puts those posts up.

15:48.320 --> 15:53.440
What if you fucking planned your whole life around one status update?

15:53.440 --> 15:58.560
You would do your entire life, just the one, and you would you could even like drop the

15:58.560 --> 15:59.040
date for it.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.560
It could be in sync with the Mayan apocalypse.

16:02.560 --> 16:07.920
And you could make that one Facebook blast that everybody on earth would read and like

16:07.920 --> 16:09.520
form a religion around.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.320
I love it.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.880
You see where Dave said he made a sandwich today?

16:12.880 --> 16:15.440
It's the only thing he ever said, but he means a lot.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.400
It touched me.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.760
That's OK.

16:17.760 --> 16:26.560
So I follow people of disparate backgrounds on Facebook, and these are the three things

16:26.560 --> 16:28.960
that you can put in your status.

16:30.560 --> 16:35.280
One, you can put in complaining about bosses.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.320
People love that.

16:37.280 --> 16:44.800
Two, you can put in pictures of your kids, then something something about being lucky.

16:44.800 --> 16:50.320
The third one is complaining about Facebook.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.560
Those are the only three things that are on Facebook.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.920
Now, are you saying that the OK, so you're not saying these are the three things you

16:55.920 --> 16:56.720
should post?

16:56.720 --> 17:01.120
No, I'm saying these are the only three things you can post because they're the only things

17:01.120 --> 17:01.920
on the service.

17:01.920 --> 17:11.280
Now, but wait, what about like a crude drawing of Obama taking away America's guns and stepping

17:11.280 --> 17:16.240
on the Constitution while Jesus cries and you post in it, you say, my daughter draw

17:16.240 --> 17:17.200
this this morning.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.160
Please pass it along if you like it.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.280
And then if you don't like it, if you don't repost, you're a communist.

17:23.280 --> 17:23.520
Yeah.

17:23.520 --> 17:29.680
And then thirty five million trillion people all post like it and thumb it something or

17:29.680 --> 17:31.200
the other way around.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.520
I mean, the other side has got them, too.

17:33.520 --> 17:33.840
Yeah.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.760
I just can't think of any right now.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.160
Yeah.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.880
None as I would say stirring.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.080
Why is he stepping on the Constitution?

17:42.080 --> 17:44.160
How did he even get out on the street?

17:44.160 --> 17:48.320
There's one where like Mitt Romney is like making a farty face and there's some comment

17:48.320 --> 17:50.080
about like women on there or something.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.200
Yeah, sure.

17:52.080 --> 17:59.760
I saw something on my Facebook who's a family friend and they posted a quote from John Adams

17:59.760 --> 18:06.000
about how the America would have no religion but God and they didn't pass my smell test.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.480
So I went I went to Google and I went to Google and I Googled John Adams quotes and I Googled

18:13.120 --> 18:15.200
quotes by this specific quote.

18:15.200 --> 18:23.600
And then I found out the truth of the matter is it is a combination of several quotes,

18:23.600 --> 18:25.360
none of which were made by John Adams.

18:25.360 --> 18:32.080
And I typed all of this into the response box of this person's Facebook before I stopped

18:32.080 --> 18:35.200
and said, fuck, what have I done?

18:35.200 --> 18:37.840
Yeah, because your whole afternoon was gone by that.

18:37.840 --> 18:43.040
That's the whole fucking day was rebutting.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.720
It was a fucking book report on this guy's Facebook tweet.

18:48.800 --> 18:54.800
Yeah, the whole day was spent on rebuttals that I couldn't do anything with that time.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.760
I'm not getting it back.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.560
Maybe that's how he taught you.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.160
And if that was his trick all along.

19:01.200 --> 19:01.840
Oh, man.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.680
Oh, man.

19:03.680 --> 19:10.800
And then the same guy later was talking about how he put the IRS asked him how many dependents

19:10.800 --> 19:16.560
he had and he put on 11 million welfare moms, two million crackheads.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.640
And I thought and I thought, man, but this guy's a Christian, too.

19:20.640 --> 19:24.800
I thought, man, I bet I'm going to this is a fucking this is true.

19:25.360 --> 19:30.960
I thought, man, I want to Jesus love take care of poor people.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.280
I want to find a Bible verse where Jesus said that.

19:33.280 --> 19:37.520
No, Justin, you're just a cog in the machine.

19:39.600 --> 19:45.520
So I literally got to this exact same place again where I'd selected some choice Bible

19:45.520 --> 19:48.240
verses that was really going to put it in his pursuit.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.360
And then I stopped myself and I did it again.

19:51.360 --> 19:56.400
This is why Facebook is amazing, because it's the only propaganda that allows you to propaganda

19:56.400 --> 19:59.280
back and then have propaganda back at your propaganda.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.800
Yeah, this is this is great.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.040
Justin is like a lot of people are never going to see this side of Justin, except for me,

20:05.040 --> 20:09.280
the side of Justin that I have to talk down when somebody says something mean to him on

20:09.280 --> 20:11.200
the Twitter or Facebook because he's about to go off.

20:11.200 --> 20:18.000
Justin is basically like Internet Batman, only instead of like instead of like getting

20:18.000 --> 20:18.960
super strong.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.560
It's also about somebody I care about.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.080
That's also something I'll get mad at.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.680
But you're like Internet Batman.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.880
If like Batman, like if the Joker was doing something bad and so the Batman started training

20:32.880 --> 20:37.520
his body and then would like get a bunch of tools together and then would like go and

20:37.520 --> 20:41.680
like step outside the Batcave and then think about how awkward the confrontation is going

20:41.680 --> 20:46.640
to be and then just like goes back inside and plays Bioshock or something.

20:46.640 --> 20:51.120
Yeah, I also can I jump back to the Yahoo question real quick?

20:51.120 --> 20:51.680
Yes, yes.

20:51.680 --> 20:57.920
Yes, I also like this idea of having a Facebook rival that they have no idea that you are

20:57.920 --> 20:59.040
their Facebook rival.

20:59.040 --> 20:59.280
Sure.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.960
So every time when it's like their birthday, you like change your information.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.160
So it looks like it's your birthday.

21:04.160 --> 21:08.320
And then you see who gets more posts on the wall or when like they put a picture of a

21:08.320 --> 21:10.000
baby, you find a picture of a baby.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.680
You put it like now this is my baby.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.280
You see who gets the most likes.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.600
Or you kidnap them and then you take control of their Facebook and then their likes are

21:17.600 --> 21:18.480
your likes.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.840
Give me your passwords.

21:19.840 --> 21:20.880
Yeah, it'll be like,

21:20.880 --> 21:22.960
Swear to me.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.240
God damn it.

21:24.240 --> 21:28.880
That woman who posted that picture of Obama feeding the Constitution to a baby playing

21:28.880 --> 21:30.800
with a kitten is my Salieri.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.840
She's got 250 likes on that bitch.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.680
That's such a good picture.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.480
God damn it.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.160
I can't believe she beat me to that.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.280
I'm going back to Reddit.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.200
We'll find something really good to get her back.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.880
I got this great velociraptor thing.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.080
Oh, it's going to make her look so stupid.

21:46.080 --> 21:52.480
And I wrote like fucking 800 words about why the chronology of this does not work out.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.760
Who is the baby?

21:53.760 --> 21:54.720
What does he represent?

21:56.640 --> 21:57.200
Facebook.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.640
Here's the truth about the Facebook.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.640
And it's sort of my whole...

22:03.200 --> 22:04.080
It's not just for me.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.040
It's not just Facebook.

22:05.040 --> 22:05.760
It's life.

22:05.760 --> 22:06.320
You know?

22:06.320 --> 22:07.200
Uh oh.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.680
You got to write Matthew McConaughey in Mexico.

22:09.680 --> 22:14.400
No, listen, listen, let's get these stinky, sticky bongos out.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.160
Let's just let's rap about this.

22:17.920 --> 22:22.720
Fucking how is anyone ever supposed to miss you if you're always there?

22:24.160 --> 22:26.960
Are you saying to disappear for a while?

22:27.520 --> 22:29.920
Was that on the, uh, was that on the note?

22:29.920 --> 22:32.480
The tweet stream of quotes from the notebook?

22:32.480 --> 22:33.680
Because I do follow that.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.680
Hey, listen, for real.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.840
Listen, if you're a bird, I'm a bird.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.200
I mean, fuck.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.840
I'm going to puke.

22:44.640 --> 22:44.880
Fuck.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.720
Listen, seriously, for real.

22:46.720 --> 22:47.200
Seriously.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.480
Listen, for real.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.960
This is F-R-E-A-L life lesson.

22:54.960 --> 23:01.520
How, like, if you're always tweeting and booking and LinkedIn and then about everything you do,

23:02.320 --> 23:03.440
no one's going to give a shit.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.760
You got to compress.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.760
And even then, nobody gives a shit about anything you do.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.920
The reason that your friend gets all these likes is because he says something broad.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.480
He says something that means something to everybody, not just him.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.080
Went to five guys today.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.200
Too many fries.

23:18.080 --> 23:18.960
Zero likes.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.480
No, everybody likes fries.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.920
No likes, no shares.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.320
You know why?

23:24.320 --> 23:27.520
Because everybody went to fucking five guys today.

23:27.520 --> 23:27.760
Yeah.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.120
You know what?

23:29.120 --> 23:31.120
I'm going to drop some Carnegie on you.

23:31.120 --> 23:31.520
Here we go.

23:31.520 --> 23:40.960
Because you can win more friends in two weeks of getting interested in other people

23:41.760 --> 23:47.600
than you can in two years of trying to get other people interested in you.

23:48.400 --> 23:55.200
You put up a Facebook status that is about your life and how much it blows slash rules.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.960
I don't like either one of those.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.480
If it rules, I feel jealous.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.320
If it blows, I feel empathy.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.560
I don't like either of those emotions.

24:02.560 --> 24:08.000
If you put on your status like five o'clock somewhere, you know I like that.

24:08.000 --> 24:08.960
Because I'm into that.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.400
I feel that.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.280
I'm with you on that.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.720
Or get engaged.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.720
Because that's what I did, and I got fucking like 350 likes in two hours.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.840
I love this, Travis.

24:19.840 --> 24:23.120
You have just given birth to the king of ideas.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.000
Cracked it.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.120
Get engaged.

24:25.120 --> 24:25.920
Or just every-

24:25.920 --> 24:29.600
And then end it and then get engaged again on cycle.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.160
That's a little extreme, but there are a ton-

24:32.160 --> 24:33.680
Opened up my new business today.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.240
Three days later, business went under.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.760
Should have had a better plan.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.080
Anyone know a good music to listen to?

24:40.800 --> 24:42.560
And then say like, pray for me.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.200
Pray for me.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.520
I've got to go pray on it.

24:45.520 --> 24:46.400
Like, oh my god.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.280
Anybody got any choice quotes about prayer and its meaning and value?

24:51.280 --> 24:55.040
Anyone got some sweet Bible verses for me?

24:55.040 --> 24:55.840
Need them.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.360
Last weekend was my birthday.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.960
Happy birthday.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.640
No, no.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.680
Happy birthday, Justin.

25:01.680 --> 25:02.000
Not me.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.560
Like, like, like.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.960
Like, like, like, like, like.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.200
I'm going to share that with all my business friends.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.040
Oh, one other idea.

25:11.040 --> 25:15.360
Find a picture of an old guy in a military outfit and then say,

25:15.360 --> 25:16.720
this was my pop pop.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.720
He passed away this week.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.360
Or something like that.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.880
Oh, like, like, like, like, like, like.

25:20.880 --> 25:25.520
People will put him in my Gmour high school sweethearts.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.200
People are going to like that.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.640
This is my G-Paw.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.600
Red blood Americans.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.840
This is my G-Paw in the war.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.200
I like how your G-Paw looks.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.520
I want to be his LinkedIn professional buddy.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.280
I want to buddy link with him.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.240
Like, like, like.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.720
I named my farm bill after my G-Paw.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.160
I re-tweeted your grandpa's pussy farm.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.000
Last weekend was my birthday.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.480
I got a little swerve on some devil's juice.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.840
You've mixed your idioms there.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.800
That's not an idiom.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.520
We're going to move on.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.560
I woke up the next morning with a busted up face.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.520
Broken nose and multiple scrapes.

26:05.520 --> 26:09.360
I work at a corporate job where things like this will not look good.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.840
Can't pass it off as a Fight Club incident.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.400
I need to come up with a good explanation for this.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.520
That isn't, I got drunk and don't remember.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.600
Any help here in B&B AM?

26:21.600 --> 26:22.320
Bill.

26:22.320 --> 26:22.640
Bill.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.360
Couple things I need to know here.

26:25.360 --> 26:25.840
Yeah.

26:25.840 --> 26:30.000
One, most importantly, why can't you pass it off as a Fight Club incident?

26:31.120 --> 26:33.280
Why do such squares work at your workplace?

26:33.840 --> 26:37.840
Two, do we need to CSI this shit and figure out what happened?

26:38.640 --> 26:39.120
Yeah.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.760
Like, what kind of scrapes are we talking about, Bill?

26:41.760 --> 26:43.680
Do you have any scrapes on your palms?

26:43.680 --> 26:47.840
If not, you did not try to catch yourself or you got into an altercation with someone

26:47.840 --> 26:51.120
and it was not falling, so it punched you in the face.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.000
That's good.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.520
Check the blood splatter, too.

26:53.520 --> 27:02.720
Bill, I do want to say, we'll get back to the problem with your corporate job.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.280
You know what?

27:03.280 --> 27:04.320
Let me just wrap that up.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.680
Tell them you fell off your bike.

27:05.680 --> 27:06.160
Move on.

27:06.160 --> 27:06.400
Yeah.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.240
All right, tell them you got the shit beaten out of you.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.120
It doesn't matter.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.240
Let's talk about the first half of your question.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.400
See if you can see where the gap is.

27:15.280 --> 27:17.200
Last weekend was my birthday.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.000
Happy birthday.

27:18.000 --> 27:18.720
Happy birthday.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.200
That's good.

27:19.200 --> 27:19.520
Yeah.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.480
Click, click, click, click.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.560
I got a little swerve on some stuff.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.480
Little swerve on some devil's juice.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.760
Oh, Bill got drunk.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.640
I woke up the next morning with a busted up face.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.920
Okay, hold on.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.440
Now, wait a minute, Bill.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.880
There's a gap there.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.040
That's a pretty big gap.

27:38.400 --> 27:45.760
I can say in all of my years of enjoying alcohol, I have never gotten so drunk that I've woken

27:45.760 --> 27:50.960
up the next day, busted up, broken nose and multiple scrapes and gone,

27:50.960 --> 27:52.880
well, something happened.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.040
Yeah, sure.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.240
No, I've woken up with two jellyfish on my chest like a bra.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.160
Sure, who hasn't?

28:00.160 --> 28:01.440
We've all been there.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.560
I've woken up surrounded by busted up faces.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.680
I just screamed like, oh, no, not again.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.600
Yeah, sure, sure.

28:11.200 --> 28:15.360
One time I woke up and I'd eaten the majority of the contents of a sandbox.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.960
That was a bad one.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.080
It wasn't even your sandbox.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.440
It wasn't my sandbox.

28:21.440 --> 28:28.800
One time I went to sleep and I dreamed I was eating a giant marshmallow and then when I

28:28.800 --> 28:37.120
woke up, my pillow was gone, but it turned out I had pica and I was deficient in many

28:37.120 --> 28:38.720
pillow-based minerals.

28:38.720 --> 28:44.240
You just told a joke that everybody ever has heard at summer camp, but you took it and

28:44.240 --> 28:46.960
you made it smart for the 21st Century podcast.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.520
And slightly depressing because you couldn't help it.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.880
It was a compulsion.

28:50.880 --> 28:56.560
Yeah, apparently the paint they used in my low-income housing project was lead-based

28:56.560 --> 28:59.680
and gave me pica, so I ate my pillow.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.440
Did you not have anyone with you, Bill?

29:02.080 --> 29:04.720
What kind of fucking friends let you fall on your face?

29:04.720 --> 29:05.440
Bad ones.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.400
Bill fell.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.400
If you ever see people carrying people out of a bar drunk, this doesn't happen, Bill.

29:12.400 --> 29:12.880
Yeah.

29:12.880 --> 29:17.680
Bill, your resolution for this year of your life, be get better friends.

29:17.680 --> 29:22.240
Get sturdier, more like of a bracing kind of friend.

29:22.240 --> 29:22.740
Right.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.360
How do you win them, you ask?

29:25.360 --> 29:33.360
Well, you can win more friends in two weeks of being interested in other people than you

29:33.360 --> 29:33.760
can-

29:33.760 --> 29:36.480
So you get interested in how you're going to hold them up.

29:36.480 --> 29:42.000
And also, you can make more friends by not drinking so much that you stop being alive.

29:42.720 --> 29:47.440
Okay, I want to bust this myth, Mythbusters style.

29:47.440 --> 29:47.940
Okay.

29:48.640 --> 29:53.280
It is not more fun to get so drunk that you can't fucking remember the fun you were having.

29:53.280 --> 29:53.520
Yeah.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.240
Right.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.440
Like, that doesn't, like-

29:55.440 --> 29:56.240
You can only hope-

29:56.240 --> 29:57.360
I remember being that old.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.720
I remember being 22 and in college and thinking that the only way I was really

30:00.720 --> 30:03.840
celebrating my birthday is if I got so drunk that I couldn't remember.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.040
That's stupid.

30:05.040 --> 30:10.320
That's like saying I want to spend a bunch of money to go see a movie and fall asleep during it.

30:10.320 --> 30:18.720
Unless you hire an archivist or some manner of scribe to follow-

30:18.720 --> 30:20.880
A bard, perhaps, to follow you around.

30:20.880 --> 30:21.440
A bard.

30:21.440 --> 30:25.440
Okay, if someone's writing an epic poem about it, then yes.

30:25.440 --> 30:32.560
Travis, what's that one bard from Hercules named who writes songs on Hercules?

30:32.560 --> 30:33.040
Ioli?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.160
Iolus.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.120
Travis, you know this.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.080
I think it's Iolus.

30:36.080 --> 30:36.560
Yaris.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.760
It was played by Ted Bundy.

30:39.760 --> 30:40.000
No?

30:40.000 --> 30:40.560
No, it wasn't.

30:41.280 --> 30:41.920
Ted-

30:41.920 --> 30:42.720
Ted Raimi.

30:42.720 --> 30:43.440
Ted Raimi.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.120
And he was Andy Iolus.

30:45.120 --> 30:45.840
What is it?

30:45.840 --> 30:46.880
Iolus.

30:46.880 --> 30:47.760
Aw, geek check.

30:48.960 --> 30:49.200
Really?

30:49.200 --> 30:50.880
Because you asked, like, eight times.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.600
I got you.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.400
I got you.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.240
Griffin's gonna edit it so it's like-

30:54.240 --> 30:56.560
He was actually on Xena and not Hercules.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.400
Oh, man.

30:58.400 --> 31:02.640
Travis, Griffin's gonna edit that in a way that's, like, makes it sound like a sick geek check.

31:02.640 --> 31:06.480
I'm gonna pour a cup of water into another cup and make it sound like pee

31:06.480 --> 31:07.920
and, like, the pee's going into your diaper.

31:07.920 --> 31:11.360
Now I'm even more worried about the fact that maybe that's not the right name.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.000
And I would look like a stupid geek.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.120
I thought it was Jafar.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.080
I'm pretty sure that's off base.

31:18.080 --> 31:18.720
Joxer.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.000
Joxer?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.120
Then who is Iolus?

31:21.120 --> 31:23.360
Oh, was that Bruce Campbell's character?

31:23.360 --> 31:24.160
I think it was.

31:24.160 --> 31:27.600
Good news, Travis, you have thoroughly dismissed my geek check.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.760
You have passed the test or failed it.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.480
I've lost track.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.240
But was that Bruce Campbell's character?

31:32.240 --> 31:33.280
I need you to check that now.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.360
I'm not doing that.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.080
Justin.

31:36.080 --> 31:36.880
Moving on.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.160
But Justin.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.080
Let's go to the money zone.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.120
Justin!

31:55.120 --> 31:56.320
Do you like to fuck?

32:02.720 --> 32:03.200
Fuck.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.720
But you're bored with it.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.120
Do you like to fuck on the cheap?

32:07.120 --> 32:08.320
Do you like to fuck?

32:09.280 --> 32:12.080
Not cheap, Travis, because these aren't cheap toys

32:12.080 --> 32:14.800
we're talking about at ExtremeRestraints.com.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.480
We're talking about value.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.080
They're cost effective.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.480
More inches per dollar.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.520
You trying to fuck?

32:23.520 --> 32:25.360
Sorry, I hadn't said it.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.720
I wanted to say it because it sounded fun.

32:28.720 --> 32:33.040
ExtremeRestraints.com is, and I don't think I'm out of line here,

32:33.040 --> 32:34.880
it's an adult super store.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.920
They've got everything.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.720
It sure as fuck not a kid's super store.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.480
It is an adult play land.

32:43.680 --> 32:46.320
And I also want to stress, before we give the wrong idea,

32:46.960 --> 32:48.880
they're super nice and it's a super great place.

32:48.880 --> 32:49.680
They're the best.

32:49.680 --> 32:54.480
Seriously, if you are going to buy sexual pleasure,

32:54.480 --> 32:56.960
if you're going to buy marital aids, and you should,

32:57.920 --> 32:58.240
this is the place to go.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.760
Or premarital aids.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.360
Okay, well, okay.

33:01.360 --> 33:04.000
Okay, well, no, that's okay.

33:05.920 --> 33:06.720
But it is a place to go.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.640
They're really nice and it's super classy and great shit.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.360
So much good feedback from the community.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.680
So many purchases, so many happy customers,

33:15.680 --> 33:18.320
and by happy, I mean they've cum buckets.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.080
And if you want to buy a cum bucket,

33:22.080 --> 33:24.640
that's on the third page, I think.

33:24.640 --> 33:28.560
It is actually an augmented version of the game Mr. Bucket.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.680
You put the balls in your mouth.

33:29.680 --> 33:33.120
And you do indeed put the balls in your mouth.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.000
Yeah, in fact, it is not actually that augmented at all.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.400
It is basically just they sell Mr. Bucket.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.160
And I know what you're asking, you're saying,

33:40.160 --> 33:42.800
but Travis, I've priced cum buckets before,

33:43.360 --> 33:46.160
and they were always 20% too expensive.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.360
That's what's held me back.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.360
Well, I've got good news.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.080
That's right.

33:50.080 --> 33:55.040

Very discreet.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.080
And they make this fun, which it should be.

34:10.640 --> 34:14.240
And their workers legit listen to My Brother, My Brother,

34:14.240 --> 34:16.320
and Me while they're packaging your stuff.

34:16.320 --> 34:21.840
Yeah, so imagine that a urethral sound probe

34:21.840 --> 34:24.880
that you put in your urethra has been bombarded

34:24.880 --> 34:27.680
by M-B-M-B-A-M at some point in the process.

34:27.680 --> 34:28.320
Oh, that's great.

34:28.320 --> 34:35.440
It's like we're singing a lullaby as the Master Blaster dildo.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.520
No, there's gotta be a funnier thing.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.240
Dildmatron.

34:50.640 --> 34:53.040
and we're sure you've enjoyed every single one,

34:53.040 --> 34:55.680
but you've never thought, ah, that's just not for me.

34:55.680 --> 34:56.640
Maybe it is for you.

34:56.640 --> 34:57.520
Go Google it.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.520
Go buy 20 cock rings, put them together,

34:59.520 --> 35:02.000
make it look like an extra long lifesavers package.

35:02.720 --> 35:08.880
And I want to say, I want to put in a brief note also

35:08.880 --> 35:11.680
that as long as you're on the internet,

35:12.720 --> 35:14.480

35:17.680 --> 35:18.880
maybe you want to build a website,

35:18.880 --> 35:20.800
not a competitor at extremetrapace.com.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.840
Well, you could build a website where you talk about

35:23.840 --> 35:26.000
how awesome extremetrapace.com is.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.560

35:52.480 --> 35:53.840
If you want to get likes on the book,

35:54.400 --> 35:58.320
you have got to get some cross post functionality in there.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.400
That's the big thing about it right now,

36:00.400 --> 36:01.920
is cross post functionality.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.880
So listen, you're going to go to squarespace.com

So like, the internet's out there and there's plenty of space.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.360
I know it seems like it's full,

36:25.360 --> 36:28.160
but there's, there's a space for your idea.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.800
My sister's going to appear in a local independent film.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.400
She's super excited as this is her first acting experience.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.600
And I'm proud of her for pursuing her dreams.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.840
I'm looking forward to going to the premiere and supporting her,

36:39.840 --> 36:41.120
but here's the problem.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.440
There is evidently a risque love scene

36:43.440 --> 36:47.280
and I feel weird about seeing my little sis in flagrante,

36:47.280 --> 36:48.640
even if it's simulated.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.240
How should I handle this?

36:50.240 --> 36:52.240
Pretend I have to pee whenever things look like

36:52.240 --> 36:53.760
they're heading to the bedroom.

36:53.760 --> 36:56.400
Develop a sudden intense interest

36:56.400 --> 36:58.400
in the bottle, bottom of my popcorn bag.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.320
Prudish in Pennsylvania.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.800
Well, don't do that because your dick's down there.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.280
Yeah, that's your, and speaking of which,

37:05.280 --> 37:07.120
it will probably not look great

37:07.120 --> 37:08.880
is as soon as your sister gets naked,

37:08.880 --> 37:10.400
you have to excuse yourself to the bathroom.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.440
Yeah, gotta go to my bunk.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.800
Bye.

37:12.800 --> 37:13.760
I'll be in my bunk.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.320
Here's the thing.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.040
Suckers.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.920
You just watch the movie like an adult.

37:18.560 --> 37:18.800
Yeah.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.400
Listen, your sister's got a fine ass set of boobies.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.560
No, I'm saying that she's pretending.

37:26.560 --> 37:27.760
You sit there and enjoy.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.560
Hey, hey, don't make me turn this car around.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.400
Enjoy your sister's bosoms.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.360
Don't pretend like you're not curious.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.400
That's my thing.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.080
And this is the best way to check them out.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.600
No, we can't go down this road with you guys.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.040
No, listen, for real,

37:41.040 --> 37:44.160
this is the best way to check them and peep them because it's gonna be artsy and shit.

37:46.800 --> 37:47.680
Check them and peep them.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.560
They're artsy.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.800
Never gonna get bad luck from Jesus or otherwise.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.440
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.800
Like, like, like, like, love.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.200
Sis, you look fantastic.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.720
Psalm tonight.

38:02.720 --> 38:03.840
Long story short.

38:03.840 --> 38:04.480
Good work.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.400
Like, like, like, like, like, like.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.280
Game of Thrones.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.240
I finally get it.

38:08.240 --> 38:13.760
Like, like, like, like, like, like.

38:13.760 --> 38:14.400
Oh, Jesus.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.040
Oh, shit.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.080
I'm sorry, Prudish.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.600
Um, there is so many.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.560
There are so many.

38:18.560 --> 38:21.680
We're joking because there's so many unknown fucking gradients.

38:21.680 --> 38:22.320
Yeah.

38:22.320 --> 38:23.440
How bad is the movie?

38:24.080 --> 38:25.680
That also, what is the love scene?

38:25.680 --> 38:27.280
What if it's really tasteless?

38:27.280 --> 38:30.400
And if it's really tasteful and awesome and well shot and you never have to see it.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.560
But if it's the fucking sex scene from the room,

38:32.560 --> 38:35.200
get the fuck out of there along with everyone else.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.600
Travis, that is comparatively mild.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.800
Are you fucking kidding?

38:38.800 --> 38:41.680
It goes from the sex scene in Forrest Gump

38:41.680 --> 38:47.280
to the fucking ass to ass scene in Requiem for a Dream.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.920
Like, things can get so bad in there.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.600
Yeah, it can get really bad.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.680
Things can get real thorny.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.800
It's going to be tense.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.920
You got to cut the tension.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.400
Just wait.

38:56.400 --> 39:02.640
But you can help your sister and this film company by saving 20% at ExtremeRestraints.com.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.520
Wait for an opportune moment and then just shout.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.080
Do a sit up.

39:08.080 --> 39:11.760
Because I think that, first off, that's some great sister griefing right there.

39:11.760 --> 39:16.960
I mean, you need to use this as a great opportunity to attack as your sibling.

39:16.960 --> 39:21.680
Are you saying he should shame his sister's naked body in front of everyone?

39:21.680 --> 39:24.240
Wait till in her first film appearance?

39:24.240 --> 39:28.480
Wait till it's projected two stories high and then point out that maybe,

39:29.120 --> 39:30.720
maybe cutting back on the snack or something.

39:30.720 --> 39:34.160
It's like mom's pizza rolls have had quite an effect on your midriff.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.400
Gross.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.840
It won't be that weird.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.880
It's only going to be weird if you make it weird.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.320
And just pretend you're French.

39:42.960 --> 39:43.760
Okay, real quick.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.320
Just real quick.

39:44.320 --> 39:47.520
If the podcast start for the next episode is my dick.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.960
I'm quitting the podcast.

39:52.960 --> 39:53.520
Okay.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.400
So let's not, but like an artsy dick.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.360
Maybe someone did a cast up.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.280
Oh God, you can't go.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.520
You can't go to the movie.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.200
You want to go to be supportive.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.400
You can't go.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.400
I just decided you can't go.

40:08.400 --> 40:08.800
Sorry.

40:10.400 --> 40:16.320
If you, the thing is if, okay, if it's a premiere and they know the actress is there

40:16.320 --> 40:19.040
and then there's a nude scene, they know her family's with her.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.280
They are going, you have to be there.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.560
They are going to look.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.160
Everyone is going to look.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.040
Especially if it's, it's a fucking local film.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.640
Like everyone knows it.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.280
You've got to invest yourself in the emotion of the scene.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.360
That's the only way you're going to get through it.

40:33.360 --> 40:36.160
Like if you weird yourself out about it, it's going to get weird.

40:36.160 --> 40:40.320
If you just really think about how touching it is and God, I hope it's touching.

40:40.320 --> 40:44.320
Cause if it's like some brown bunny stuff, I don't know what to tell you.

40:44.320 --> 40:47.040
You are just in a bad way.

40:47.040 --> 40:53.840
This, this represents a time in which getting so drunk that you cannot remember what happened

40:54.960 --> 40:55.840
may not be a better.

40:55.840 --> 40:56.080
Yeah.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.960
Maybe just hoist a few or eight before.

40:58.960 --> 41:02.800
Can I inject what may be an unpopular opinion though?

41:02.800 --> 41:08.720
Do you know what would be really more uncomfortable than going to the movie and watching your

41:08.720 --> 41:15.520
sister bone down or up is if you went and everything about the movie was really terrible

41:15.520 --> 41:18.480
and then you had to pretend that you loved it for me.

41:18.480 --> 41:24.160
That would be more uncomfortable than watching, than watching like Justin and Travis in a

41:24.160 --> 41:32.960
Caligulon orgy scene if they were in the movie, listen to me, listen to me, yes, maybe let's

41:32.960 --> 41:35.520
yes, yes, yes.

41:35.520 --> 41:38.480
You have a horrible imagination and you're a terrible person.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.040
It can get weird.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.120
It can get weird up in there, but let me finish my point.

41:41.120 --> 41:41.600
Okay.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.280
Go on, please continue.

41:43.280 --> 41:53.120
I would rather watch that in a good movie where you both did good acty jobs than a movie

41:53.120 --> 41:57.440
than a movie where you both tastefully, tastefully made love.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.920
No skin at all.

41:59.920 --> 42:06.080
You could be wearing wet suits and dry humping, but you act really bad and then for the rest

42:06.080 --> 42:07.520
of my life, I have to carry that weight.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.720
I feel like some shit just came out, but listen.

42:14.720 --> 42:22.720
You're saying the after effect of having to say I loved it because you watched them have

42:22.720 --> 42:26.560
sex is weird or because it was terrible and you had to lie.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.000
It's going to be better.

42:28.000 --> 42:35.360
You can joke about, oh, man, you really took that hog, you took that hog so good.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.480
I was really proud of the way you took that hog.

42:40.480 --> 42:42.880
You really, it was like wild hogs in there.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.520
You did not hold back and I was deeply impressed.

42:47.120 --> 42:52.640
I haven't seen a hog embrace that openly since at the end of Wild Hogs when Tim Gunn hugged

42:52.640 --> 42:57.360
Tim Allen and then David Alan Grier watched.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.400
I haven't seen the movie.

43:00.480 --> 43:02.800
You can goof that, but you know what you can't goof?

43:03.360 --> 43:07.680
Man, you are just not going to make it here.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.720
This is not going to work.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.720
This is not going to be your jam.

43:13.040 --> 43:17.280
Look on the bright side, it's going to be uncomfortable for you and it's going to be

43:17.280 --> 43:19.360
better than the utter shame your parents will feel.

43:19.360 --> 43:23.040
They're just going to be really embarrassed and wonder where they went wrong.

43:24.160 --> 43:29.360
Look, Darlene, we made that and now it's having sex in front of us 80 feet tall.

43:31.040 --> 43:35.280
In front of, oh, all of our friends and oh, there's some neighbors.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.680
Look at that bosom, man.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.760
She is really getting slam jammed up there.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.200
Glad we made that.

43:41.200 --> 43:43.440
How could they afford Mickey Rourke for this movie?

43:43.440 --> 43:44.480
This is great.

43:44.480 --> 43:48.000
That's our DNA up there getting slam-o jam-o'd by Mickey Rourke.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.520
Hey, please pass me the knives.

43:54.560 --> 43:57.360
I'd like to die a bit more if that's okay with everyone here.

43:57.360 --> 44:02.080
I'd like to be less alive than I am currently, which is to say all the way dead and not like

44:02.080 --> 44:05.200
Bill and Ted dead where I come back later as soon as your hijinks.

44:05.200 --> 44:06.800
I mean, dead as fuck.

44:06.800 --> 44:09.680
Like Oblivion embracing the sweet Oblivion.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.880
This sprite is delicious.

44:11.520 --> 44:12.960
What a good acting you did.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.160
I'm so proud of you.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.640
I hope we all go to Applebee's afterwards and talk about it.

44:16.640 --> 44:17.440
I hope you do.

44:17.440 --> 44:18.560
I'll be dead.

44:18.560 --> 44:22.960
By the way, I just want to say that accounting degree I paid for is really paying off.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.080
Let's just finish the show.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.760
We're only at like 45 minutes.

44:31.760 --> 44:32.480
It was great.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.560
We've helped literally no one.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.800
We laughed at the first person.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.640
We gave no helpful advice to the second person.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.480
Made fun of them for being an alcoholic.

44:42.480 --> 44:46.000
And the last person, we told them to enjoy a sister boner.

44:46.000 --> 44:46.560
We're great.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.680
Let's keep going forward.

44:47.680 --> 44:53.360
The way I imagine it is people listen to this show one chapter at a time spread out over

44:53.360 --> 44:54.160
the week.

44:54.160 --> 44:58.720
So since they did not have Monday and Tuesday to go through with us, that means that they

44:58.720 --> 45:03.520
only need five sevenths of the show they normally get because it doesn't have to last them as

45:03.520 --> 45:03.840
long.

45:03.840 --> 45:05.040
Does that make sense?

45:05.040 --> 45:06.080
None of it did.

45:06.080 --> 45:09.440
In fact, it stopped making sense so soon that I didn't listen to most of it.

45:11.040 --> 45:11.680
Good.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.040
You guys want to hear a great joke?

45:13.040 --> 45:13.840
It's on Yahoo.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.120
Okay.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.080
Justin Cain sent it in.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.440
I've never read a Yahoo joke before.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.160
We'll see how it works.

45:19.200 --> 45:22.560
Ronnie says, how do you make a horse laugh then cry?

45:24.800 --> 45:29.040
To make a horse laugh, you go up to the horse and whisper in their ear, my dick is bigger

45:29.040 --> 45:29.680
than yours.

45:30.400 --> 45:34.480
To make a horse cry, the guy shows him his penis and it was bigger.

45:38.960 --> 45:42.880
That is a pretty that almost beats my Pika joke.

45:42.880 --> 45:44.800
Almost comes close.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.440
Yeah.

45:45.440 --> 45:48.320
The top answer on that says horses don't care about penis size.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.160
Bullshit, they don't.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.760
They don't even speak English, you guys.

45:51.760 --> 45:57.120
You don't evolve penises that big without some sort of underlying biological imperative.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.480
And a man with a penis larger than a horse's is to be pity.

46:04.480 --> 46:07.920
He will never have a full erection and could not lay with a woman even if he could.

46:10.000 --> 46:10.560
Weird.

46:10.560 --> 46:10.960
Yes.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.320
Do you guys want another Yahoo?

46:14.320 --> 46:15.120
I guess.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.400
It was sent in by Krista Whalen.

46:16.400 --> 46:16.960
Thanks, Krista.

46:16.960 --> 46:24.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gaara who asks, can a spirit get you pregnant?

46:27.040 --> 46:31.920
My friend's boyfriend just died 10 days ago and she thinks his spirit had sex with her

46:31.920 --> 46:33.120
while she was sleeping.

46:33.120 --> 46:37.440
And when she woke up, she had blank in her Virginia.

46:38.320 --> 46:40.560
Is it possible to get pregnant from a spirit?

46:40.560 --> 46:52.320
Do you know what a sad commentary it is that I had to wait to the end of that question

46:52.960 --> 46:56.400
before I could remember whether or not we have answered this question?

46:58.720 --> 47:04.240
It was literally to the point where you had a blank in her Virginia before I realized,

47:04.800 --> 47:08.720
no, I guess we haven't specifically talked about this.

47:08.720 --> 47:11.760
Four of our variations and also it's a Tuesday.

47:11.760 --> 47:12.800
Oh, OK.

47:12.800 --> 47:13.040
Yeah.

47:13.040 --> 47:16.880
Variations on a ghost come theme, I think, is what we've had.

47:16.880 --> 47:17.200
Right.

47:17.200 --> 47:20.880
That is also my favorite Miles Davis record.

47:20.880 --> 47:21.440
Sure.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.840
If you've never enjoyed variations.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.040
I go to the alternate.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.120
The alternate title was kind of boo.

47:28.560 --> 47:29.520
Kind of goo.

47:30.160 --> 47:30.400
Yeah.

47:31.760 --> 47:32.880
Kind of boo goo.

47:32.880 --> 47:39.120
I guess.

47:39.120 --> 47:41.600
I mean, once you read a question like that, is it possible?

47:41.600 --> 47:43.600
No, don't even answer that question.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.480
Isn't it possible?

47:44.480 --> 47:46.640
I mean, isn't it possible?

47:47.200 --> 47:47.840
Listen, guys.

47:47.840 --> 47:48.240
OK.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.960
Medical science is still finding new things out every day.

47:52.480 --> 47:52.720
OK.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.480
So yes, the answer is yes.

47:54.480 --> 47:58.960
OK, so you're saying there's infinite life in the universe and it's always expanding.

47:58.960 --> 48:03.600
So why can't your friend find a little bit of ghost come around her vagina?

48:03.600 --> 48:04.080
Yes.

48:04.080 --> 48:04.720
For what?

48:04.720 --> 48:06.800
That sentence was the grossest.

48:06.800 --> 48:07.360
Yeah, nothing.

48:07.360 --> 48:12.720
I like I like that this question is not my friend has gotten pregnant and claims that

48:12.720 --> 48:14.960
it's from a spirit, but the fear.

48:14.960 --> 48:15.680
Yeah, yeah.

48:15.680 --> 48:19.120
That, oh, God, I hope she doesn't get pregnant from a spirit.

48:19.120 --> 48:19.520
Sure.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.280
Let's let's let's read something else.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.240
This is this is off.

48:22.240 --> 48:23.840
Let's say anything else.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.040
OK, guys, I want you to know.

48:25.040 --> 48:28.960
You know, the oldest was the friend on Hercules.

48:28.960 --> 48:34.320
Our holocaust was the name of Bruce Campbell's thief character, which appeared on both shows.

48:34.320 --> 48:35.280
OK, OK.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.480
I just wanted to clear that up.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.600
I didn't want all the emails.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.360
How is there any debate about that?

48:41.920 --> 48:43.360
We didn't clear that up in the question.

48:43.360 --> 48:46.960
I apologize for whoever is building a thing outside of my house.

48:46.960 --> 48:50.080
I don't want to I don't want to talk too loud because they might hear me.

48:50.080 --> 48:52.080
But it's it's six, 16 p.m.

48:52.080 --> 48:55.760
Who the fuck is building something now of all the building?

48:55.760 --> 48:59.680
I'm too afraid to look out because he's like literally he's looking at the window.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.680
Guys, I'm on the first floor.

49:01.680 --> 49:02.960
He'll literally see me.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.400
Look out the window.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.680
You're a coward.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.760
It's completely, completely irrational.

49:07.760 --> 49:09.600
But if you're building something, people are going to look.

49:09.600 --> 49:11.280
He probably wants people to look.

49:11.280 --> 49:11.840
I'm going to see.

49:11.840 --> 49:15.440
But what if he's building like what he's making a murder room?

49:15.440 --> 49:16.880
What if he's making a murder room?

49:16.880 --> 49:19.200
What if you look out the window and he's building a coffin?

49:19.200 --> 49:20.080
It just points at you.

49:20.640 --> 49:21.520
Maybe.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.360
But you know what would be more awkward?

49:23.360 --> 49:26.960
If he was making art and he was bad at it and made eye contact with me.

49:26.960 --> 49:28.800
And also he was naked.

49:28.800 --> 49:33.360
In Griffin's spectrum of social anxiety,

49:34.000 --> 49:40.320
literally the worst thing that can ever happen to anybody is someone making bad art.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.040
You think I'm joking.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.960
You probably actually know that I'm not joking,

49:42.960 --> 49:45.120
but the people who are listening probably think I am joking.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.720
I don't want to comment on that.

49:46.720 --> 49:52.640
Let me see what this let me see what he's making the Hindenburg.

49:52.640 --> 49:57.040
It was terrible, but at least there was a drawing on the side.

49:57.760 --> 49:58.240
Yeah.

49:58.240 --> 50:02.400
Maybe there was someone on there doing a bad monologue,

50:02.400 --> 50:04.160
which are playing piano badly,

50:04.160 --> 50:07.920
in which case that would have all made it a literal birdhouse.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.520
A literal birdhouse.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.960
He's building a birdhouse.

50:10.960 --> 50:12.240
A literal birdhouse.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.360
It's 617.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.480
No kids in sight.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.160
He's on speed.

50:16.160 --> 50:17.840
This birdhouse.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.680
He had to build that right now and it could not wait.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.680
He has to work through his meth energy.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.440
This birdhouse is for Ronnie.

50:24.320 --> 50:27.200
Ronnie's had a hard week, even though it's only Tuesday.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.560
Ran out of meth on a Sunday.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.800
Gotta build a birdhouse.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.080
I can't listen.

50:32.080 --> 50:32.880
We've built this.

50:32.880 --> 50:37.040
We have done built this birdhouse and I'm not going to talk anymore about people.

50:37.040 --> 50:41.360
So thanks for listening to our podcast that we share together.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.000
You've gotten through it again.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.760
I know you said you wouldn't be back.

50:45.760 --> 50:46.960
And yet here you are.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.080
So now who's the weak one?

50:48.640 --> 50:50.400
Sorry it was so late.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.000
And also it's so short.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.360
But it's not short.

50:53.360 --> 50:54.640
It's going to be a great length.

50:54.640 --> 50:55.520
Perfect length.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.080
Pretty short.

50:56.080 --> 50:59.920
But it's been a fucking insane month, you guys.

51:00.960 --> 51:02.400
I don't need your sympathy.

51:02.400 --> 51:03.440
I want it.

51:03.440 --> 51:04.400
But yeah.

51:04.400 --> 51:07.600
You want sympathy because you got a free trip to Germany

51:07.600 --> 51:09.680
and then you got to spend a week in Mexico?

51:09.680 --> 51:10.400
I pity you.

51:10.400 --> 51:10.640
Listen.

51:10.640 --> 51:11.280
So sad.

51:11.280 --> 51:11.680
Listen to me.

51:11.680 --> 51:13.680
Unlike, unlike, unlike, unlike.

51:13.680 --> 51:14.080
Okay.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.280
Okay, but listen.

51:17.680 --> 51:20.880
I forgot what I was going to say because Travis got real mean there for a second.

51:20.880 --> 51:23.360
I'm sorry, Griffin, but I want to go to Mexico.

51:23.360 --> 51:23.840
I know.

51:23.840 --> 51:25.920
But I want to go to Harmony.

51:25.920 --> 51:27.840
It's all over now is what I mean to say.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.520
I want to thank.

51:30.800 --> 51:34.800
We've got an NBNBAM Wisdom Twitter follow.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.760
We didn't create it.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.040
A friend of ours did.

51:37.040 --> 51:37.680
Not a friend.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.280
I mean, it is a friend of ours.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.240
But we don't know who the fuck it is.

51:40.240 --> 51:40.960
We don't know who it is.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.080
We just know it's a friend.

51:42.080 --> 51:42.800
Can we keep it that way?

51:42.800 --> 51:44.080
Can we keep it like Zoro?

51:44.080 --> 51:46.240
Yeah, they need their.

51:46.240 --> 51:49.840
I actually know who it is and they need their anonymity code.

51:49.840 --> 51:50.880
Tell me who it is right now.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.080
I can't tell you.

51:52.080 --> 51:54.640
At NBNBAM Wisdom.

51:54.640 --> 52:03.200
And there's also a similar wonderful Tumblr that is actually NBNBAM-Wisdom.tumblr.com.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.360
The two were created independently of each other.

52:05.360 --> 52:06.640
So you figure that one out.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.320
So thanks to both of them.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.360
Just a quick question.

52:09.360 --> 52:12.560
Sorry, I hate to keep interrupting, but just Travis, just real quick.

52:12.560 --> 52:13.360
Is it Gary Oldman?

52:15.200 --> 52:16.000
I can't say.

52:16.000 --> 52:16.480
Fuck!

52:16.480 --> 52:17.360
Is it Paul Ryan?

52:18.080 --> 52:18.960
I can't say.

52:18.960 --> 52:19.360
Okay.

52:19.360 --> 52:20.480
Is it Arianna Huffington?

52:21.360 --> 52:21.840
Yeah.

52:21.840 --> 52:22.160
No!

52:22.160 --> 52:23.440
God damn, I can't say!

52:23.440 --> 52:24.320
Is it a he or a she?

52:24.320 --> 52:25.200
Does he wear glasses?

52:25.920 --> 52:26.720
Is it Troy Aikman?

52:27.760 --> 52:28.640
Does he have a beard?
