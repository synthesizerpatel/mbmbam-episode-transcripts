00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.880
Guys. Guys.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.280
What? Are you guys there?

00:50.320 --> 00:53.120
Yes, we're here. This is it. This is the show.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.080
Did you hear the news? What's that? What's the news?

00:58.080 --> 01:04.080
I don't know how it happened, because science hasn't explained it yet, but Al Roker can see

01:04.080 --> 01:06.640
into the future. What?

01:06.640 --> 01:13.920
He is a prognosticator. He is a Gautama man. He's a modern day Nostradamus, except with more

01:13.920 --> 01:16.800
fluctuating weight patterns. Right?

01:17.520 --> 01:19.520
He can see into the future. He's like-

01:19.520 --> 01:21.280
What are you baiting, Griffin? What are you basing this on?

01:21.280 --> 01:25.920
He's like the living version of the Almanac book from Back to the Future,

01:25.920 --> 01:29.520
because he knows the living- According to what? He's like the living, eating version

01:30.080 --> 01:32.240
of the Almanac. If the book was a man.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.640
It's like he's eating Back to the Future.

01:34.640 --> 01:40.960
So, have you guys watched the Today Show lately? I know you have.

01:41.600 --> 01:48.080
I'm there every day. I turn it on at 6 a.m. I'm like, Hoda, Kathy Lee, I'll check you soon,

01:48.080 --> 01:51.760
but right now I'm Lowers. I'm all Lowers. Lowers putting some flavor.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.400
You know what I call them? You know what I call them? I call them Lowers hours.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.920
Yeah. Those are my Lowers hours.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.560
Those are your Lowers hours when you play Roker Poker,

02:00.560 --> 02:02.720
which is when you masturbate while watching out Roker.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.400
So, anyway, while you're there, you're playing Roker Poker,

02:06.400 --> 02:10.080
he tells you what's going to happen at the Olympics that day. He knows it.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.240
He knows it. He saw it.

02:13.440 --> 02:17.920
If there was any market for betting on the Olympics, this man would be rich.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.360
He has. He has.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.960
Hey, people, why haven't Bookie stepped up and worked out, I don't know,

02:22.960 --> 02:25.600
some kind of gambling on the Olympics or something?

02:25.600 --> 02:33.520
He possesses the site, and it's not very handy except for every even numbered year,

02:33.520 --> 02:37.200
I guess, but it's better than nothing. I don't have the site for shit.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.440
And honestly, let's be honest, about half of those are some games that nobody really cares about.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.520
Because you know why you don't care about the Winter Olympics?

02:45.520 --> 02:49.440
Because you don't get to see all the beautiful, all the heavenly bodies, you know?

02:49.440 --> 02:54.160
Mm-hmm. Like, that's the problem with the Winter Olympics is everybody's so frumpy.

02:54.160 --> 02:58.240
Yeah, it's like, hey, Curling, let's see that. Let's see those glutes. Get them out.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.360
I don't want it. It's not for sex. I just want to admire the glutes.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.720
Yeah, it's not a sexual thing.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.760
It's not a sexual thing at all. I promise you, I just appreciate a good muscle,

03:05.760 --> 03:08.000
and you got two of them down there. So let's peep those.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.680
Let's get that out.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.440
I was playing Roker Poker, and now these glutes are in front of me, but fuck it. Let's keep it going.

03:13.440 --> 03:22.320
I'm really enjoying the coverage that shows me the workout routines of the Olympic athletes,

03:22.320 --> 03:27.040
because I can't be motivated to do regular exercise, and now you're going to rub it in

03:27.040 --> 03:32.320
my face with the world's most physically fit people are doing, as if I'm going to go to that

03:32.320 --> 03:34.080
level. That's what I'm going to do.

03:34.080 --> 03:39.680
I enjoy the coverage that they're doing where they show things that happened at previous Olympics

03:39.680 --> 03:44.560
that were just huge and epic, like Keri Strug landing her vault and everything, and amazing

03:44.560 --> 03:50.160
moments, and then comparing the current Olympians to them. So not only do I get to feel the pressure

03:50.160 --> 03:54.880
of being compared to the current Olympians, but then they also get to feel bad, because they're

03:54.880 --> 03:57.120
not as cool as people that competed 12 years ago.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.920
It really is horse shit. You can't show the miracle on ice and then cut over to that bad

04:01.920 --> 04:08.000
mitten game that the South Korean team threw. You can't go from miracle on ice to the uh-oh

04:08.000 --> 04:14.400
with a shuttlecock. Did anybody else know that there was a bad mitten world federation?

04:14.400 --> 04:20.640
Yeah, it's one guy who's never had to do anything in his life, and then they came to him like,

04:20.640 --> 04:25.040
listen, this is the most important decision you'll ever make in your entire life.

04:25.840 --> 04:32.000
And he looked up from his bowl of ramen noodles, and he said, listen to the words I'm about to

04:32.000 --> 04:42.720
say, because they're going to be very important. This sport is kids play horse shit. We call the

04:42.720 --> 04:48.560
thing you hit a shuttlecock because of how fucking stupid it is. You can't expect me to

04:48.560 --> 04:56.080
take it seriously, because nobody else is going to. It's called bad mitten. Nobody fucking cares.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.560
It sucks. Do you think there was any kind of convincing that had to happen to get them to

05:00.560 --> 05:03.920
throw the games, or do you think it was like, I need you to- yeah, you got it.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.960
Yeah, we want you to not- You didn't even hear my pitch. No, I don't care.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.080
Here's what we want you to do. We want you to not play bad mitten.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.360
I'm afforded that option every day, and you know what? I jump at it.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.760
What do you get? What kind of sponsorships are you hoping to land if you gold in bad mitten?

05:19.760 --> 05:29.040
Oh man, you get the fly leaf. They make the best shuttlecocks. They're very aerodynamic.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.800
They actually had to outlaw them in this, because last year everybody was breaking all of the

05:33.680 --> 05:37.280
bad mitten world records. Yeah, bad mitten so far.

05:37.840 --> 05:42.000
And then one time somebody hit a shuttlecock so hard it went through a guy. It just went through

05:42.000 --> 05:47.440
his chest, and they had to cancel fly leaf shuttlecocks. And it didn't kill him. It buried

05:47.440 --> 05:51.120
halfway through. He still lives with it to this day. Yeah, it's really horrifying. It powers a

05:51.120 --> 05:55.040
mechanical suit. He's become a bit of a mascot, actually. His friends make him lie on the floor,

05:55.040 --> 06:00.160
and they put Cheetos in it. And then if he sneezes real hard, they all fly out,

06:00.160 --> 06:03.840
and it's a great game for everyone. Do you guys think that right after the Olympics,

06:03.840 --> 06:08.720
all the Olympians get together and just have a fucking Cheetos jamboree? They're like,

06:08.720 --> 06:17.520
fuck it. Michael Phelps is done. He's won 22 Olympic medals, and he said he's never competing

06:17.520 --> 06:23.120
again. That dude has got to be on a fucking combos spree right now. He's got to be filling those

06:23.120 --> 06:28.880
bugles with that whiz, and he has got to be living right. Travis pointed out, but I do have to ask,

06:30.640 --> 06:40.640
it's got to just turn into an orgy usually, right? You have a city full of the most physically fit

06:40.640 --> 06:45.840
humans in the world, and you've got them in cramped quarters. And they're all riding the

06:45.840 --> 06:52.080
highest testosterone. Yeah, right. You've got the drama. They're all coming down off the highest

06:52.080 --> 07:00.080
endorphin high of competing and winning in front of an international landscape. It's got to be like,

07:00.080 --> 07:06.000
okay, so it's time to fuck. When you have 22 pieces of precious, precious metal hanging

07:06.000 --> 07:09.760
around your neck, and you're out on the town in London surrounded by attractive people,

07:10.320 --> 07:17.600
when you have that much dÃ©colletage, all you're thinking about is, I know I'm getting fucked

07:17.600 --> 07:23.760
tonight. Michael Phelps is getting fucked tonight. There's a one in 22 chance that I'm

07:23.760 --> 07:29.360
getting boned tonight. Yeah, and Michael Phelps will fuck anything. If you slow to a trot in front

07:29.360 --> 07:34.880
of Michael Phelps, he will fuck you. And don't jump in the water thinking that it's like hornets.

07:34.880 --> 07:40.800
He's going to get you in the water. He is not machine gun fire. He can get you up in there.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.360
He will get you up in the water, and I do want to be clear. It will be consensual.

07:45.360 --> 07:51.200
If you get within a few feet of him, the way his pheromones mixed with chlorine is utterly

07:51.200 --> 07:56.160
intoxicating, at least that's what I told my wife. Web fingers attached to his 10 foot long arms

07:56.160 --> 08:00.560
will caress your cheek in such a way that you can't say no. You see him coming down the street

08:00.560 --> 08:05.680
with his metal, and you say, oh, it's just one metal, but then they fan out like the acid

08:05.680 --> 08:11.440
spitting dinosaur from Jurassic Park. All 22 of them just sort of fan out, and you swoon,

08:11.440 --> 08:17.360
and then you poon. Now, I do want to warn you about Michael Phelps. He's been training so hard

08:17.360 --> 08:22.720
that he has lost the use of the English language, so he will look directly in your eyes and say,

08:22.720 --> 08:42.720
Phelps... Phelps... inside. Phelps... inside. Please take Phelps inside. No more water.

08:42.720 --> 08:47.720
I'm sorry, Phelps clammy skin.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.720
It's dry up here.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.720
Phelps cold.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.720
Can you keep Phelps warm?

08:57.720 --> 09:00.720
To be fair, Phelps does love Chunk.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.720
Yeah, sure.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.720
This feels good on Phelps tummy fin.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.720
That's what his penis has to be for him, right?

09:10.720 --> 09:12.720
Another piece of drag, right?

09:12.720 --> 09:16.720
Another thing to shave a few hundros off the old time.

09:16.720 --> 09:22.720
Phelps is smooth down there like G.I. Joe.

09:22.720 --> 09:27.720
We can all agree that Phelps is probably a more tender lover than Ryan Lochte, right?

09:27.720 --> 09:29.720
I think so.

09:29.720 --> 09:35.720
Ryan Lochte is high on winning.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.720
Michael Phelps has been through this before.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.720
He knows how it ends.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.720
He wants you to win.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.720
He wants you to win now, Ryan.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.720
It's your time to shine.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.720
No, he wants you to win sexually.

09:45.720 --> 09:46.720
Oh, sexually.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.720
He wants you to take home the sexual gold.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.720
Hey, this is my brother, my brother and me.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.720
It's an advice show for the modern era.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.720
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.720
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.720
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.720
That was the longest lead-in I think we've ever...

10:03.720 --> 10:06.720
That was 10 advice-free minutes for the folks at home.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.720
Yeah, guaranteed.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.720
And now I want to record an R&B album called Sexual Gold.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.720
Can we sing the...

10:12.720 --> 10:15.720
Oh, baby.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.720
It's a complete spoken word album.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.720
I'm Michael Phelps.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.720
You know what?

10:22.720 --> 10:23.720
We've piddled enough.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.720
Let's get into the advice.

10:26.720 --> 10:35.720
I really want to take a swing dance class with my boyfriend, but he is vehemently opposed to the idea.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.720
I mean vehemently opposed to the idea.

10:38.720 --> 10:43.720
I'm sure it's because he's embarrassed or afraid to look stupid or uncoordinated in public.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.720
How can I convince him to get over his fear of looking silly and dance with me?

10:47.720 --> 10:49.720
And that's from dancing by myself.

10:49.720 --> 10:56.720
Well, the good news is because it's swing dancing, there's all but two people look uncoordinated doing it.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.720
And those two people are busy filming movie set in the 1940s.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.720
Right.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.720
I have to warn you something.

11:03.720 --> 11:16.720
Since the year, let's call it 1949, and every year past that, if you see two people swing dancing at a public event, everyone since 1949 has had the same thought.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.720
These fucking people.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.720
That's what everybody thinks when you swing dance in front of them.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.720
And that would be my only problem with swing dancing classes.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.720
It might actually be kind of fun to take the class.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.720
It probably would be super fun.

11:29.720 --> 11:33.720
But you know, like, Cherry Pop and Daddies are going to come on at the wedding and you're going to have a look.

11:33.720 --> 11:34.720
You just touched on it.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.720
I feel, John Favreau has done a lot of things to help this country.

11:37.720 --> 11:41.720
But that fucking scene from Swingers is not one of them.

11:41.720 --> 11:49.720
It's, I feel like that scene from fucking Swingers let an entire generation of people who saw the movie Swingers were like,

11:49.720 --> 11:51.720
I want that.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.720
If I dance good like that, then Heather Graham will like me.

11:54.720 --> 11:55.720
But she won't.

11:55.720 --> 11:56.720
She can't.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.720
You don't know her.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.720
She doesn't have emotion.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.720
She doesn't have emotions either.

12:00.720 --> 12:06.720
I also think that my other problem with swing dancing is that no one has ever started swing dancing and anyone's thought,

12:06.720 --> 12:08.720
I bet they can just naturally do that.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.720
No, that's the problem.

12:09.720 --> 12:13.720
They know you've been prepping to like impress them for a long time.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.720
And then it's like, oh, man.

12:16.720 --> 12:22.720
You're going from like, if you do that shit at a wedding or something like that, fuck you.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.720
Like, because it's their special day, not yours.

12:25.720 --> 12:29.720
And when you swing dance at a wedding, like you're not just having fun.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.720
You're performing.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.720
This is a show.

12:32.720 --> 12:37.720
Unless you're in the hit musical Swing, you should not take swing dancing.

12:37.720 --> 12:43.720
Even then, like you can stand on the stage and be like, no, guys, it just feels a little pretentious.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.720
Now we need to, now we need to help the person.

12:47.720 --> 12:48.720
This is me helping.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.720
This is me helping.

12:50.720 --> 12:51.720
You're backing up the guy though.

12:51.720 --> 12:52.720
The guy didn't write in.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.720
Well, OK, well, let me say this.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.720
This is helpful advice to tell your boyfriend.

12:57.720 --> 13:02.720
The point of a class is for people who don't know how to do it to show up.

13:02.720 --> 13:08.720
Like if his worry is looking stupid and uncoordinated and not being able to do the thing, that's why you go to a class.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.720
That's a sweet, sweet, sweet world that you live in, Travis.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.720
But that is not the truth.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.720
You think that if somebody, here's how it works, Travis.

13:15.720 --> 13:21.720
And this is a great, this is a great example of this sort of scenario, like would be perfect for this happening.

13:21.720 --> 13:26.720
Is somebody goes to a swing dancing class and they spend two years getting their swing dancing so right.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.720
And then they get out of swing dancing class and like, well, shit, now I have no place to swing dance.

13:30.720 --> 13:38.720
I know I'll go back to the beginner level swing dancing class and make people think like I'm some sort of fucking zoot suit daddy prodigy.

13:38.720 --> 13:42.720
Well, then that person should like test into swing dance six.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.720
They shouldn't be back in swing dance one.

13:44.720 --> 13:44.720
Yeah.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.720
Looking beginner Charlie, make him look stupid.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.720
That person no longer wants to learn the art of the swing.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.720
They just want to get. Oh, now he's a swing hustler.

13:51.720 --> 13:52.720
He's a fucking swing hustler.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.720
He just wants to get his rocks off.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.720
He just wants to make swing bets.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.720
And like, I bet I can throw this girl between my legs and catch her.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.720
No way, dude.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.720
This is beginner swing.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.720
And then he does it and dudes out 20 bucks.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.720
Right.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.720
Hey, I bet you can't swing.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.720
Oh, you're right. I don't swing very well.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.720
Do you want to have a swing off?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.720
And then it's like swing, swing, swing, swing, hustle.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.720
And then it's like your wife is mine now.

14:16.720 --> 14:20.720
And you see that more and more every day since swingers came out.

14:20.720 --> 14:25.720
It's suddenly everybody's swinging everywhere.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.720
Well, no, just me.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.720
That's not not exactly.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.720
I mean, swingers did come out like, like a year and a half ago tops.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.720
So it really is.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.720
It's really still pretty hot.

14:38.720 --> 14:44.720
I am having a hard time with this because I don't think I myself would.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.720
It's just such an ostentatious thing to learn.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
That's my problem.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.720
Here's the thing.

14:49.720 --> 14:55.720
I was in a couple musicals in which I learned to swing dance and it is incredibly fun.

14:55.720 --> 14:59.720
Like there's a reason it looks fun and it's because it is.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.720
And it but but it's fun for you and your partner.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.720
It's not fun for anybody else.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.720
But fuck them.

15:04.720 --> 15:09.720
As long as they give you a wide nose circles that when you lift her up and she does that thing where she kicks backwards, she doesn't knock anyone out.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.720
You're good.

15:11.720 --> 15:12.720
That's the real problem.

15:12.720 --> 15:16.720
Have you considered the legal ramifications of swing dancing?

15:16.720 --> 15:24.720
Have you considered how how the first time you like your fluffy skirt like spins around and lacerate someone's red?

15:24.720 --> 15:26.720
Yeah. Have you considered how you're going to deal with those?

15:26.720 --> 15:30.720
When you swing or like when it picks you up and your skirt falls down and like, oh, there's her butt.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
Yeah. It's awkward.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.720
Now, Travis, do you know what legal do you know what legal things are?

15:35.720 --> 15:37.720
Because that's not technically against the law.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.720
Everyone can see her legal briefs.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.720
Yeah, sure. That's gross.

15:41.720 --> 15:48.720
When you swing dance with somebody and they are the the passive, the more passive person of the swing dance.

15:48.720 --> 15:49.720
They're the sub.

15:49.720 --> 15:54.720
They are basically you are turning them into fucking human nunchucks.

15:54.720 --> 15:59.720
And like, you're not ready for that kind of level of power or responsibility.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
But no, have fun.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.720
But have fun. Really enjoy.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.720
Have fun. Really get up in there.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.720
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

16:06.720 --> 16:07.720
Yes.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.720
We've never turned a question on somebody like that before.

16:10.720 --> 16:16.720
But I guess if somebody wrote in and was like, hey, I'm thinking about like eating poison, but my boyfriend says not to.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.720
We would probably come down on the same side.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.720
I guess I like that.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.720
All I'm getting at.

16:22.720 --> 16:35.720
And and this is sort of the the maybe the more practical, you know, side of this advice is that if it's not something that both of you are excited to do, there's like so many different things.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.720
I mean, there's so many other things to do.

16:38.720 --> 16:44.720
And if he's not excited about it, I mean, you could try to you could try to badger him into it and you would win eventually.

16:44.720 --> 16:52.720
But you is that you could always trade off of like one of these classes with you.

16:52.720 --> 16:57.720
And then I'll go to and I'll finally do that gross whipped cream thing that you want me to do.

16:57.720 --> 17:02.720
Like that's where you put the nozzle for the can of whipped cream, like in your butt.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.720
And then you empty the entire can in there.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.720
You just shoot it all up in there.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.720
It's called a squeaky Greg.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.720
Why does he want to give you a squeaky Greg?

17:11.720 --> 17:14.720
It's 2012. Those are illegal.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.720
In most states, not in every state.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.720
It's illegal to give you.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.720
Well, that's the that's part of the trip he wants to with.

17:21.720 --> 17:26.720
He wants to whisk you away to Delaware or squeaky Greggs are still street legal.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.720
It's great. It's only it's only.

17:27.720 --> 17:31.720
Baby, you've got to see the trees up there and oh, we'll get some cider.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.720
You're going to love it.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.720
Hey, pack the ready whip.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.720
Just pack the ready whip in case we like want to put it on the cider or you know what?

17:38.720 --> 17:40.720
We can probably buy some cans there.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.720
Yeah. And I do mean some cans.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.720
Yeah. Please.

17:43.720 --> 17:44.720
Yeah. Yeah.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.720
Don't get it twisted.

17:45.720 --> 17:52.720
If there is only one can, we'll have to we'll have to search out some old other some old general storage or something.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.720
But hey, you know what?

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
It'll be like antiquing.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.720
Oh, it'll be.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
You know how you always want to go antiquing?

17:57.720 --> 17:58.720
It'll be like that.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.720
It'll be a lot like turning you into human cannoli.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.720
You're going to love it.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.720
It's going to. Thanks, Delaware.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
You guys want to Yahoo?

18:04.720 --> 18:05.720
Yeah.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.720
Yeah.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.720
Cool.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.720
This one was sent in by Spummy or spew me.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.720
Thank you.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.720
Whichever two of those you like better.

18:13.720 --> 18:20.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user DS who asks how to collect my scent for GF.

18:20.720 --> 18:26.720
I'm going off to college and I want to give my girlfriend some of my pheromones to remember me by.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.720
I also want them to last.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.720
What is the best way to do this?

18:29.720 --> 18:30.720
I have two ideas.

18:30.720 --> 18:36.720
One go on a run in an undershirt, then put the shirt in a bag and the freezer.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.720
I could do this multiple times.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.720
No.

18:39.720 --> 18:44.720
Should I shower without antiperspirant before the run to sleep in an undershirt for a couple of days?

18:44.720 --> 18:47.720
Presumably I should shower before this, too.

18:47.720 --> 18:52.720
I'm extremely healthy in terms of diet and exercise, and I know my sweat should be pretty pure.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.720
Don't tell me I'm weird.

18:53.720 --> 18:54.720
I already know.

18:54.720 --> 19:00.720
Is purity a factor?

19:00.720 --> 19:06.720
Oh, this is 100% crystallized pure.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.720
I am so grossed out right now.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.720
This shit will get you so high.

19:11.720 --> 19:18.720
What he's asking is in what form should I scum up a t-shirt and give it to my girlfriend?

19:18.720 --> 19:21.720
Because nothing says I love you like handing over some dirty laundry.

19:21.720 --> 19:26.720
Hey guys, girls aren't weird like you are.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.720
They're not weird.

19:29.720 --> 19:37.720
There's no reality in which it's like, gosh, Darlene, I really enjoyed getting drinks with you and the girls,

19:37.720 --> 19:42.720
but right now I have to go home and smell my boyfriend's dirty shirt for the freezer.

19:42.720 --> 19:48.720
It's six months old, and he ran in it for eight days, and it's grown legs, and it's walking around in the freezer.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.720
Let's see.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.720
I got some skinny cow up in here.

19:53.720 --> 19:54.720
I got some ready whip.

19:54.720 --> 20:03.720
I got a brown and yellow flannel that used to be a white shirt.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.720
It used to be a plain white shirt.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.720
Now it's a brown and yellow flannel because of its odors.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.720
Why not just get her a fucking necklace?

20:11.720 --> 20:14.720
How about a necklace?

20:14.720 --> 20:16.720
How about a necklace or a DiCaprio?

20:16.720 --> 20:18.720
How about you just do that?

20:18.720 --> 20:21.720
Or a locket, and you can drip your juices into a file.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.720
No, I'm trying to stay away from anything that comes from your body.

20:24.720 --> 20:30.720
No, because we've got to keep your smell in the rotation somehow, so you've got to get some sort of phylactery.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.720
Okay, so you're going to want to get her a pillow case stuffed with your own hair.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.720
How about just a pillow that you have slept on?

20:36.720 --> 20:42.720
Because when you sleep on a pillow for long enough, that pillow is basically a small dead version of you

20:42.720 --> 20:45.720
because it's covered in your cells and your smells.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.720
So just give that to her, and then she can have that.

20:48.720 --> 20:53.720
And then when you're off fucking all kinds of college buddies and you're developing new smells,

20:53.720 --> 21:03.720
smells like incense, smells like swing dancing, other college books, then she'll have that to remember you by.

21:03.720 --> 21:08.720
Hey, I have a message for this question asker.

21:08.720 --> 21:13.720
Listen, I've only known you for one Yahoo Answers question,

21:13.720 --> 21:17.720
but I'm pretty sure that she is planning on dumping you before you go.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.720
You are very weird.

21:19.720 --> 21:24.720
Although it might be, it's a pretty good excuse as you hand her your gross sweaty t-shirt for her to be like,

21:24.720 --> 21:27.720
oh, this is exactly the window I've been looking for.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.720
You're done.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.720
Great, you're done. You're out.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.720
Three strikes. You're out.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.720
It's actually 38 strikes. You're so weird.

21:35.720 --> 21:36.720
Oh, what is this?

21:36.720 --> 21:39.720
It's a grocery bag with an old ass sweaty t-shirt in it.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.720
Okay, great.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.720
The door's over there. It's been fun.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.720
It's cold out there. Do you want this back? Are you sure? Okay.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.720
We've actually never dated.

21:49.720 --> 21:50.720
Hey, real quick.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.720
You sit behind me in math class, so thank you for the shirt.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.720
I appreciate the shirt. Can you just run me through really quick?

21:56.720 --> 22:02.720
Why does it stink like shit?

22:02.720 --> 22:06.720
I really like the iPod Nano you've given me.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.720
I was curious why it doesn't reek of your personal musk.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.720
It's damp, though.

22:12.720 --> 22:19.720
Yeah, it is damp, but it doesn't really reek of your self-esteem.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.720
I am a woman, and this is a man's shirt.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.720
It does not appear to be new out the store,

22:25.720 --> 22:29.720
and it reeks like shit like a man would smell.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.720
So if you could just run me through really quick, I'm going to miss you so much.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.720
Have fun at college.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.720
Have fun at college. Goodbye.

22:37.720 --> 22:46.720
A lot of people don't know that Blue Can Trail wrote Hit Em Up Style after exactly an incident like this.

22:46.720 --> 22:51.720
Her boyfriend gave her a musk shirt, and then she went on a shopping spree.

22:51.720 --> 22:55.720
Justin, have you ever worried that you have an inappropriate fascination with Blue Can Trail?

22:55.720 --> 23:00.720
It's like every other episode we reference that fucking song.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.720
You really think so?

23:02.720 --> 23:07.720
I wasn't going to say anything, but you're in a safe place here, and we love you.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.720
I just feel like you're a little bit obsessed with it.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.720
I just think she's a talent.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.720
Our key demographics, the numbers we've really pushed the ads on,

23:16.720 --> 23:19.720
this is a generation that does not know this song, I bet.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.720
We could start referencing Single Ladies. That's a good one.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.720
Would that be good? Would that be better?

23:24.720 --> 23:28.720
He gave her a stank ass shirt, and he didn't put a ring on it.

23:28.720 --> 23:34.720
I think in this case, Irreplaceable would be better.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.720
To the left, to the left.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.720
I know, it's so hard to say.

23:38.720 --> 23:43.720
All your fucking stinky shirts are in the garbage, and I set them on fire because they smell so bad.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.720
And then they sweat, got burned, and now it's in my walls.

23:47.720 --> 23:52.720
You need to tear down all the wallpaper and put up new wallpaper.

23:52.720 --> 23:57.720
Because it smells like your body odor in the kitchen, which sucks because that's where I eat.

23:57.720 --> 24:01.720
Baby.

24:01.720 --> 24:06.720
Hey, I've had a crush on a girl for a few months now. I just asked her out yesterday.

24:06.720 --> 24:11.720
She said that she was flattered, but she doesn't think the relationship would be for her.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.720
That's a crazy excuse.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.720
That sounds great, just not for me.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.720
That sounds like a really weird, interesting arrangement.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.720
Just not sure it would be a great fit for me right now.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.720
But I'll tell all my friends.

24:23.720 --> 24:29.720
So my question is, should I continue being her friend and pursue a relationship later or just try to move on?

24:29.720 --> 24:32.720
We are in our early 20s.

24:32.720 --> 24:38.720
You need to take that microphone, and you need to turn it horizontally to the ground.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.720
And then you need to let it fall.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.720
And then you need to put one fist in the air, and then you need to walk away.

24:44.720 --> 24:51.720
There was a piece of advice that Griffin used to give quite frequently, but I think it would be apropos in this case.

24:51.720 --> 24:55.720
Don't wear silk on a Sunday.

24:55.720 --> 24:56.720
Nope.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.720
No, not that.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.720
Give the people what they want.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.720
Fish and friends go bad.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.720
Nope.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.720
So eat them both quickly.

25:06.720 --> 25:07.720
Nope.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.720
Are you talking about like, I'll pack your bags and move away?

25:10.720 --> 25:13.720
Yeah, you do that because you're done.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.720
You're out and you can't be here anymore.

25:15.720 --> 25:21.720
When you say to a girl, hey, I think we should go out on a date, and she says, that sounds great, just not for me.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.720
That's not really what I'm into right now.

25:23.720 --> 25:28.720
You pick up your bags and put on your hobo hat and you shuffle on down the road to the next town.

25:28.720 --> 25:36.720
That advice, though, is incongruous with the other advice which we've been giving out this year, which is get it in 20 days.

25:36.720 --> 25:43.720
This person took a shot, went for it, went up to this person, got it, didn't get it, but they shot for it.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.720
You know what I mean?

25:45.720 --> 25:48.720
But he didn't stick the landing to continue on with the Olympics.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.720
You didn't stick the landing.

25:49.720 --> 25:57.720
And he shouldn't have to fucking leave town because there are tons of reasons to pack your bags and move away, and I don't think this is one of them.

25:57.720 --> 26:16.720
But you're forgetting about, and this is sort of the dark side of 20 Does, right, because as powerful as Get It in 20 Does is, it's sort of like whatever motherfucker first said, live like you were dying or carpe diem or whatever.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.720
Can we work YOLO?

26:18.720 --> 26:19.720
YOLO, exactly.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.720
It's so much fun to say. I wish we could say it more on the podcast.

26:21.720 --> 26:22.720
I know, right, but we can't.

26:22.720 --> 26:26.720
I feel like this power's been tapped already, the YOLO power's been tapped.

26:26.720 --> 26:31.720
Not too late for Gangnam Style, but it's too late for YOLO, I think.

26:31.720 --> 26:32.720
Sure, Gangnam Style, okay.

26:32.720 --> 26:45.720
But like, the dark side of that is that you are not dying, and you are going to carpe other diems, and you do only live once, but you have to live the whole thing.

26:45.720 --> 26:48.720
You can dance like nobody's watching, but guess what?

26:48.720 --> 26:52.720
People are fucking watching, and they're saying, look at those fucking douchebags swing dancing.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.720
I have an idea.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.720
No day but today.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.720
And then Tuesday.

26:57.720 --> 26:58.720
Yes, that's accurate.

26:58.720 --> 26:59.720
And then your dad's birthday.

26:59.720 --> 27:04.720
And then your dad's birthday, and then you and Janine are going out to the lake.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.720
There's other days, there really are.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.720
This is my suggestion.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.720
This is what people need to start doing.

27:08.720 --> 27:12.720
Carry around with you a tiny notepad and a tiny pencil.

27:12.720 --> 27:20.720
And if something like this happens again, and you ask a girl out, and she says no, pull out the notepad and pencil and cross something off and say thank you very much for your time.

27:20.720 --> 27:24.720
Then move to the next closest girl to you and ask her out.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.720
And then just continue on with the circle, marking people off your list.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.720
That is actually metaphorically like how Travis got through college.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.720
That's basically just like that.

27:32.720 --> 27:42.720
When you said that, did you think of that as soon as we read the question, and then you just sort of let her sit there in the chamber and wait for a time in which you could interpret?

27:42.720 --> 27:44.720
I actually let that bounce around for a while, and it still came out.

27:44.720 --> 27:50.720
You let that one just percolate, and you really honed it down to a perfect diamondine point.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.720
I don't see anything wrong with that, because what it is is it gives you an out.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.720
The fucking dumbest thing ever to do that anyone's ever done.

27:56.720 --> 28:02.720
No, because it gives you an out, because suddenly you're not embarrassed, because she was just next on the list to see what was up.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.720
Yeah, except everyone's going to think you're a fucking serial killer, dog.

28:05.720 --> 28:06.720
Well, there is that.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.720
I'm not saying it's a perfect plan.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.720
It's the farthest from that.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.720
It's the farthest from perfect.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.720
I'm not saying it's a perfect plan.

28:13.720 --> 28:14.720
It's a plan of garbage.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.720
It has some faults.

28:16.720 --> 28:17.720
It's all faults.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.720
It has some faults.

28:19.720 --> 28:20.720
It's made from faults.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.720
It's from fault pie.

28:22.720 --> 28:26.720
It has a certain air of fault to it.

28:26.720 --> 28:27.720
It's a fault tart.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.720
There's not even a crust on top.

28:29.720 --> 28:34.720
It's just a bottom crust of dookie, and then faults all through it, made in it.

28:34.720 --> 28:35.720
You know, to each his own.

28:35.720 --> 28:36.720
That's what I say.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.720
Yeah, one man's trash is a...

28:38.720 --> 28:39.720
Yep.

28:39.720 --> 28:42.720
One man's fault is another man's win.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.720
It's...

28:44.720 --> 28:50.720
So, here is the answer, and I will tell you the answer now.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.720
You are out.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.720
Like, Griffin had it right.

28:53.720 --> 28:54.720
You're done.

28:54.720 --> 28:55.720
And because...

28:55.720 --> 29:00.720
And I'm not saying, like, men and women can't be friends, because they can.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.720
But that's not what you were in it for.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.720
That's not what you...

29:04.720 --> 29:05.720
Not at all.

29:05.720 --> 29:11.720
And if you were to continue to be her friend under the pretense of eventually dating her again...

29:11.720 --> 29:13.720
Yeah, girls know that.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.720
Like, they're pretty smart about...

29:15.720 --> 29:17.720
If you think you're gonna, like...

29:17.720 --> 29:20.720
You're gonna Wile E. Coyote your way through this one.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.720
Like, she's not gonna see it coming, and then she'll fall off a cliff, and you'll catch her, and you'll be in love forever.

29:25.720 --> 29:32.720
Because if you think about it, like, what's your hope that she, right now, when you were really playing game, wasn't interested?

29:32.720 --> 29:37.720
But maybe if you try to fake a friendship with her, and she knows that for a while, that's what's gonna make her go,

29:37.720 --> 29:42.720
You know, I'm gonna think twice about this guy now that he's totally trying to worm his way into my life.

29:42.720 --> 29:48.720
It's just gonna be hard on your heart, and you shouldn't spend your time that way.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.720
It's spent...

29:49.720 --> 29:50.720
Dog...

29:50.720 --> 29:51.720
Fucking...

29:51.720 --> 29:52.720
Listen to me.

29:52.720 --> 29:53.720
Listen to the words I'm saying.

29:53.720 --> 29:58.720
This is a hundred percent, like, legitimately true advice.

29:58.720 --> 30:02.720
If you're in college, don't waste a fucking second on this.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.720
Don't waste a goddamn second.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.720
Because you're not always gonna be in college, and then you're gonna look back and say,

30:07.720 --> 30:10.720
Oh my god, why did I waste as much time as I wasted?

30:10.720 --> 30:12.720
It keeps me up at night.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.720
Like, don't let it happen to you.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.720
Just live it as hard as you possibly can.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.720
Don't be a statistic.

30:19.720 --> 30:24.720
And don't pine for people who are callous with your heart.

30:24.720 --> 30:29.720
Do what you can now so that you don't have to look back when you're old and callous and say to people in college,

30:29.720 --> 30:31.720
Move on, man, don't waste a minute.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.720
Don't turn people into projects.

30:34.720 --> 30:39.720
There are people out there, there are dozens of people out there who would like you and would like to spend time with you

30:39.720 --> 30:43.720
and want to be with you because you are who you are.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.720
People you don't have to, like, wear down.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.720
Don't waste your time that way.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.720
Get it. Get out.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.720
Get it in 20 does with somebody else now.

30:52.720 --> 30:53.720
You're done.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.720
Cross around the list and move on to the next person.

30:55.720 --> 30:56.720
Don't fucking...

30:56.720 --> 30:57.720
No lists!

30:57.720 --> 30:58.720
Don't do that!

30:58.720 --> 30:59.720
It works!

30:59.720 --> 31:07.720
You can have lists in... I feel like elementary school is okay to have lists of girls that you would want to, you know,

31:07.720 --> 31:11.720
I guess in elementary school, like, smooch on the cheek or something.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.720
I don't think that that can...

31:13.720 --> 31:14.720
Your top ten smooch list.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.720
Yeah, your top ten.

31:15.720 --> 31:20.720
I don't think that that can go... I don't think that can leave the elementary school.

31:20.720 --> 31:28.720
And don't go to elementary school now and make one because you're fucking 22 and that's gross.

31:28.720 --> 31:33.720
Do you think that metaphorically, like, when we look back at college and think of all the times we didn't get it.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
Yeah.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.720
And you're like, ugh.

31:36.720 --> 31:40.720
Do you think that's what, like, all of life is like that metaphorically?

31:40.720 --> 31:44.720
Like, if you're not getting it, it's so...

31:44.720 --> 31:48.720
The difference between college and the life I'm living right now, this is what I'm saying.

31:48.720 --> 31:53.720
The difference between college and the life I'm in right now is similar to the difference between...

31:53.720 --> 31:58.720
Is relatable metaphorically the difference between being alive and being dead is basically what I'm saying.

31:58.720 --> 31:59.720
Yeah.

31:59.720 --> 32:00.720
Do you think that's an accurate metaphor?

32:00.720 --> 32:01.720
I don't think it's...

32:01.720 --> 32:09.720
I bet that Hell is just like a series of being able to watch, like, completely watch on like television or on a giant movie screen,

32:09.720 --> 32:16.720
those moments and then like having a pop up video that's like, if he would have done this,

32:16.720 --> 32:22.720
then this is the million dollar idea that would have changed his life or it would have been the most amazing night of his life.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.720
But he didn't because he was chicken shit.

32:24.720 --> 32:29.720
Hey, if you'd ordered the Panang curry, Steve Buscemi would have heard and he'd be like, oh, bro, that's my fave.

32:29.720 --> 32:30.720
Let's party down.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.720
And then he would have been best friends with Buscemi.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.720
Yeah. And that is, I guess, life's ultimate achievement.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.720
What the fuck are you talking about?

32:37.720 --> 32:38.720
I regret...

32:38.720 --> 32:39.720
I'm just saying it's a cool thing that could happen.

32:39.720 --> 32:40.720
My life is perfect right now.

32:40.720 --> 32:44.720
I have a great podcast and family and girlfriend and job.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.720
But man, me and Buscemi were buds.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.720
What if Buscemi were your roommate?

32:49.720 --> 32:54.720
Oh, God, I would forsake everything to be a Buscemi bud.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.720
You fucking idiots.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.720
I'm sorry that this isn't enough.

32:58.720 --> 33:06.720
I'm sorry that you don't live satisfying lives and that you need like a trap toothed actor to help you,

33:06.720 --> 33:08.720
to help you find satisfaction.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.720
I'm going to tell Sydney all this shit that you said and Teresa.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.720
You don't have to listen.

33:13.720 --> 33:17.720
Listen, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I love you.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.720
But I, I love, love Buscemi.

33:19.720 --> 33:23.720
So I just feel like there's a Buscemi shaped hole in my heart.

33:23.720 --> 33:27.720
It was for Sydney's for Sydney's sake that I didn't pick like a girl or something.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.720
Like I didn't say like and then Kathleen Turner would hear.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.720
And you would get totally crazy.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.720
So wait, in your mind, Kathleen Turner is the female version of Steve Buscemi?

33:36.720 --> 33:38.720
Like they're equivalent.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.720
Right. Exactly.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.720
Oh, Christ.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.720
Let's go to the money zone.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.720
It's time.

33:45.720 --> 33:46.720
I'm ready.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.720
You're ready.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.720
Hey, Griffin, who's this message for?

34:01.720 --> 34:04.720
It's for Amanda A-M-A-N-D-A.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.720
Hey, Travis, who's this message from?

34:07.720 --> 34:09.720
From Cody.

34:13.720 --> 34:14.720
It's from Cody?

34:14.720 --> 34:15.720
For fuck's sake.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.720
Oh, was there like a thing?

34:17.720 --> 34:21.720
That would have been the traditional first anniversary gift is paper.

34:21.720 --> 34:23.720
And the internet is kind of like paper.

34:23.720 --> 34:33.720
So Cody thought that an N-B-N-B-A-M blessing would be a neat way to surprise his beautiful, loving, nerdy wife while she's driving or doing her makeup.

34:33.720 --> 34:41.720
After all, she first introduced Cody to that sweet, sweet McElroy wisdom.

34:41.720 --> 34:48.720
So congratulations to the two of you on your anniversary, on your first one.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.720
And Amanda and Cody, I want you to know you have my blessing.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.720
You can now pursue your relationship with the blessing.

34:55.720 --> 34:57.720
Time to consummate this.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.720
What else we got, Travis?

34:59.720 --> 35:02.720
Can we just address the fact that what we do is not paper?

35:02.720 --> 35:07.720
You realize we're not like talking into paper and then putting it on iTunes.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.720
Well, hold on.

35:09.720 --> 35:13.720
Okay, well, I've been meaning to talk to you about your recording setup for a while because it's...

35:13.720 --> 35:15.720
It filters out all my plosives.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.720
Yeah.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.720
Travis used to pop his pees really bad.

35:19.720 --> 35:23.720
But then he started shouting it into paper, making indentions and reading it with a needle.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.720
And it depends on like how loud it is because sometimes it's three-sheeter, sometimes it's a four-sheeter.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.720
It just depends on the day.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.720
Yeah, tell me about it.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.720
Poop, like poop.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.720
Nope.

35:33.720 --> 35:36.720
We got another message for Tyler Matheson.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.720
And the message is from Ben Gordon.

35:39.720 --> 35:44.720
He says, happy birthday to a loyal MBMBAM listener for a present.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.720
Could you creatively insult our friend, Corin?

35:47.720 --> 35:51.720
He's getting a dual masters in literature and poetry.

35:51.720 --> 35:57.720
I would submit that Corin is doing a fine job of it himself.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.720
But how can we make fun of him?

35:59.720 --> 36:00.720
He's a dual master.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.720
Yeah.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.720
He's fighting in both literature and poetry.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.720
He's killing people with his words.

36:07.720 --> 36:13.720
I don't want to get on this guy's bad side since he's so good at Yu-Gi-Oh!

36:13.720 --> 36:18.720
That joke worked on two levels because he probably is pretty good at Yu-Gi-Oh!

36:18.720 --> 36:23.720
I'm just glad that he's working long and hard, like probably 80 hours a week on these masters

36:23.720 --> 36:26.720
so that he can work at McDonald's, I guess.

36:26.720 --> 36:30.720
What do you do with literature and poetry degrees?

36:30.720 --> 36:31.720
Besides try to impress women.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.720
That's off.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.720
You took it right out of my mouth.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.720
Guys, I want to talk about the all new Squarespace 6.

36:36.720 --> 36:40.720
This is a web design tool that lets you build your own website.

36:40.720 --> 36:46.720
It's got beautiful new templates, a drag and drop, super simple interface, responsive design.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.720
It's got social media connectivity.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.720
It's got cloud stuff up in it.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.720
So go to Squarespace.com.

36:52.720 --> 36:57.720
Our listeners get 10% off by using offer code MYBROTHER8.

36:57.720 --> 36:58.720
That is the number 8.

36:58.720 --> 36:59.720
Don't spell it out.

36:59.720 --> 37:07.720
MYBROTHER8 and you can get 10% off, all one word, and you can get 10% off their web tools.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.720
I mean, it looks really slick.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.720
It looks like some slick ass website.

37:11.720 --> 37:15.720
And send us a link to the website you make with it so we can check it totally out.

37:15.720 --> 37:16.720
Go check it out.

37:16.720 --> 37:24.720
I can't confirm that griffonspacejam.com is built on Squarespace, but wink nod.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.720
Maybe it is.

37:25.720 --> 37:26.720
But it probably isn't.

37:26.720 --> 37:30.720
I don't want to give them a bad name because it's a nice website, but it's not Squarespace material.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.720
I did want to mention one other thing.

37:32.720 --> 37:38.720
Fundinghunter.com, it's a free social site directed to entrepreneurs and investeurs.

37:38.720 --> 37:46.720
Members can make profiles and pitch their ideas to other members using tools and features.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.720
Anyone could be an investor.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.720
Members make the connections and build relationships.

37:51.720 --> 37:53.720
We provide the platform.

37:53.720 --> 37:58.720
This site, Fundinghunter.com, is where you can learn more.

37:58.720 --> 38:05.720
It's especially applicable for us because I think it's fair to say we've had a history of bad investments.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.720
You think that's accurate.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.720
I keep betting against Michael Phelps.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.720
What the fuck am I thinking?

38:11.720 --> 38:12.720
That's not an investor.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.720
I did want to talk to you about that.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
That's gambling.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.720
No, it's an investment in Winston.

38:16.720 --> 38:22.720
I invested in Family Circus, the comic strip.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.720
But here's the problem.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.720
The return on that investment, it has been zero.

38:27.720 --> 38:31.720
I don't think that's a thing that you can invest in.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.720
I did invest in it.

38:34.720 --> 38:39.720
I filed the investment papers from the ride-aid parking lot, from the guy.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.720
From that one guy.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.720
If it makes you feel any better, at least it's just a zero return.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.720
I've been losing money on Marmaduke for years.

38:47.720 --> 38:52.720
That guy, though, he's got to be making a killing.

38:52.720 --> 38:53.720
He's always out there.

38:53.720 --> 38:57.720
He's been out there for 20 years, it seems like.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.720
I got a little more specific.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.720
I'm more of a risky investor.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.720
I short sold Beetle Bailey.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.720
That's a real blue chip there.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.720
He's a blue chip.

39:09.720 --> 39:12.720
That's one of your classic performers.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.720
It mitigates the risk, I think.

39:14.720 --> 39:18.720
I tried to short sell Jeffy, but then the cop showed up.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.720
It's hard.

39:19.720 --> 39:20.720
That's tricky.

39:20.720 --> 39:24.720
There's a lot of copyright that goes into that, a lot of trafficking.

39:24.720 --> 39:29.720
It's a sticky little wicket.

39:29.720 --> 39:37.720
I got into BC really hardcore, but all the religious undertones really put off all my potential buyers.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.720
I'm not going to fall for that one again.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.720
Hey, Lockhorns!

39:43.720 --> 39:49.720
Hey, if you could just turn a profit in this quarter fiscally, please.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.720
Thank you.

39:50.720 --> 39:55.720
Can you stop with the fighting and maybe focus on Black Ink for once?

39:55.720 --> 39:56.720
If you could do that.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.720
You're the worst, Lockhorns.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.720
Just get a fucking divorce!

40:00.720 --> 40:03.720
You're not happy together.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.720
Split the stocks.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.720
I'll take the shares of the lady and you take the shares of the guy.

40:09.720 --> 40:11.720
We can just focus on profitability.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.720
Maybe you meet somebody nice.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.720
You're wasting your lives, Lockhorns.

40:16.720 --> 40:21.720
You're wasting your lives.

40:21.720 --> 40:27.720
Hey, my coworker is trying to get me to play Magic the card game, but I don't think my street cred can handle it.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.720
Got any suggestions?

40:29.720 --> 40:33.720
That's from Too Cool For Cards.

40:33.720 --> 40:34.720
You don't have any street cred?

40:34.720 --> 40:39.720
Yeah, well, first off that, guaranteed if you listen to this podcast, you ain't got no cred.

40:39.720 --> 40:43.720
I love you listeners, but come on.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.720
You ain't hard.

40:45.720 --> 40:55.720
But also, more importantly, fuck your street cred because that shit's gonna keep you from doing all kinds of cool stuff that you would otherwise miss out on.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.720
Like playing Magic.

40:56.720 --> 41:03.720
And by cool stuff, I don't mean in the traditional sense where anybody would ever look at you and say, oh, that's a desirable sexual object.

41:03.720 --> 41:07.720
But you'll probably have fun.

41:07.720 --> 41:12.720
Griffin, you don't think ability to play Magic is a trait that people look for in a sexual partner?

41:12.720 --> 41:18.720
I don't think anybody has ever perused somebody's swamp deck and gone, this person is fuckable.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.720
Highly fuckable.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.720
Now, I'm gonna disagree because I've been to PAX.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.720
I'm going to disagree with you.

41:24.720 --> 41:25.720
I think that's probably happening.

41:25.720 --> 41:32.720
I do want to, if I had someone who was trying to get me to play Magic, I would probably do it.

41:32.720 --> 41:35.720
My problem is that I'm a 31-year-old man.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.720
I live in my house.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.720
You mean that better than living outside your house?

41:39.720 --> 41:43.720
I mean that in the hermetically sealed sense.

41:43.720 --> 41:47.720
Justin is sealed for freshness inside of his house.

41:47.720 --> 41:48.720
Right.

41:48.720 --> 41:53.720
That's how I keep my cherubic look is I don't let myself get exposed to the elements.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.720
His front door is tamper-proof.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.720
No one's getting in here.

41:57.720 --> 42:07.720
The only reason I'm not playing super nerdy-ass board games in Austin is just because I haven't met a group of people to play those with yet.

42:07.720 --> 42:11.720
You can't be afraid of...

42:11.720 --> 42:20.720
I've realized recently that it's a lot like trying to find, what I imagine, trying to find a drug dealer or buying or selling drugs.

42:20.720 --> 42:25.720
There's a lot of innuendo and raised eyebrows when it comes to D&D.

42:25.720 --> 42:31.720
I just started working at the theater and we were talking about video games and Dragon Age came up.

42:31.720 --> 42:37.720
Somehow that led to this, like, have you ever played Dungeons & Dragons?

42:37.720 --> 42:40.720
I mean, I may have.

42:40.720 --> 42:48.720
I remember when we were trying to find out if our group of friends in Huntington would be interested in playing the new D&D.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.720
This was a few years back.

42:50.720 --> 42:57.720
It was our cool going out drinking buddy group of friends that I don't think we'd ever even played Risk with or anything like that.

42:57.720 --> 43:06.720
Trying to broach that subject with them is like two fucking intelligence agency officers trying to drop secret codes at each other.

43:06.720 --> 43:12.720
Like, hey, have you ever watched Lord of the Rings?

43:12.720 --> 43:15.720
Do you like that swords and shit?

43:15.720 --> 43:17.720
Yeah, what's that all about, huh?

43:17.720 --> 43:26.720
Like in, you know, like Willow, like goblins and just like, hey, do you like Candyland?

43:26.720 --> 43:31.720
Sorry, are you in operation or anything?

43:31.720 --> 43:38.720
Can you imagine a world in which someone just like knocked on a door and was just like, I love Dungeons & Dragons and I think you do too.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.720
Let's do this.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.720
Oh, okay.

43:42.720 --> 43:45.720
Suddenly it's out here in the light of day.

43:45.720 --> 43:49.720
Oh, it's a lot more attractive than I would have thought.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.720
Here's what's up.

43:51.720 --> 43:54.720
I used to feel this nerd shame in a big, big way.

43:54.720 --> 44:04.720
And even when I was like writing about games professionally, like I would be embarrassed to tell people what I did because I was in college and I was super, I cared about what other people thought about me.

44:04.720 --> 44:10.720
But like, don't ever, if you want to play Magic the Gathering, like if you want to get super into it, just fucking do it.

44:10.720 --> 44:16.720
Like if you want to do something and it's healthy, then just do it.

44:16.720 --> 44:21.720
And don't let, you know, your so-called street cred, which isn't a real thing that exists.

44:21.720 --> 44:28.720
Everybody's too busy like giving a shit about whether or not people think what they're doing is nerdy to actually do it to other people.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.720
So just fucking.

44:30.720 --> 44:42.720
But like, okay, I see your point. Like I know what you're saying and I do think anybody can get hung up on, you know, outside perception.

44:42.720 --> 44:49.720
But at some point your inner perception comes into play too.

44:49.720 --> 44:56.720
I mean, I think it's legitimate to say that you don't want to see, that's not the kind of person that you want to be.

44:56.720 --> 45:01.720
You don't see yourself as the sort of person who plays Magic the Gathering.

45:01.720 --> 45:04.720
But they haven't tried it yet.

45:04.720 --> 45:10.720
First off, they haven't tried it yet. But second off, it's fucking stupid to define yourself that way.

45:10.720 --> 45:18.720
Like, when you play, like if you play Magic the Gathering, if you start playing it, you are not all of a sudden the guy who plays Magic the Gathering.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.720
And if you do think of yourself that way, then you need to-

45:20.720 --> 45:24.720
Literally define, yes, you're incorrect. But go on.

45:24.720 --> 45:29.720
You know what I mean. You're not like, hey, I'm the magic guy. Like, people don't introduce you to parties.

45:29.720 --> 45:38.720
How many times do you think you need to get spotted by babes playing Magic the Gathering before that particular image sticks?

45:38.720 --> 45:41.720
You're goofing. You are goofing right now.

45:41.720 --> 45:46.720
But this is like the actual thing this person is worried about. Just fucking own it.

45:46.720 --> 45:52.720
It's 2012. It's not 1995 where you're going to get beat up for fucking playing Magic the Gathering.

45:52.720 --> 45:59.720
A nerd is not going to, or a bully is not going to come and like drop a big pile of sand in front of you and then proceed to kick it all over your face in cards.

45:59.720 --> 46:04.720
Like, that scenario, by the way, did not take place on a beach. That's why they had to bring their own sand to kick on you.

46:04.720 --> 46:10.720
They're not going to open a bag of sand and dump it at your feet and then wait for the whole thing to empty out and then kill you.

46:10.720 --> 46:16.720
I swear to God, if you own it, like, you are never, ever, ever going to have an issue with this.

46:16.720 --> 46:23.720
When John Locke was playing board games with his friend across the phone, is that when you thought John Locke ruled?

46:23.720 --> 46:29.720
Or did you think John Locke ruled when he went to an island and brought a box of knives and started getting it?

46:29.720 --> 46:32.720
That's, like, you don't ever see him like on the island.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.720
And then he carved his own chess set.

46:34.720 --> 46:35.720
Like, yeah.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.720
With those knives, Justin.

46:37.720 --> 46:38.720
Okay, correct.

46:38.720 --> 46:44.720
And he played backgammon on the beach with Walt.

46:44.720 --> 46:48.720
They're just trying to cling to civilization at that point. That's different.

46:48.720 --> 46:53.720
If he had Sid Meier's civilization on the island, he would have put his knives down and said, oh, I think I'm going to get really good at this.

46:53.720 --> 46:59.720
And maybe there's a chance that you start playing Magic Gathering with your friend, and then the writers realize that he's going nowhere.

46:59.720 --> 47:03.720
So they write him off the show until, like, season six, and then they bring him back.

47:03.720 --> 47:10.720
There's lots of things I haven't tried that I don't think are cool, so I don't want to do them.

47:10.720 --> 47:11.720
Like what?

47:11.720 --> 47:18.720
We just had like a ten-minute goof about how we're not going to take swing dancing classes because we don't want to be those people.

47:18.720 --> 47:27.720
But that's different because if I got super into magic and I went out to a park or something and had an intense Magic the Gathering match, I wouldn't be doing it so other people would look at me.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.720
Quite the opposite, actually.

47:29.720 --> 47:37.720
But if I went to the park and started swing dancing, I might as well put up signs and fucking charge admission.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.720
But would you wear a cloak?

47:40.720 --> 47:44.720
That's what I keep coming back to is my question. Would you wear a cloak?

47:44.720 --> 47:47.720
You're bordering on hate speech right now, so watch it.

47:47.720 --> 47:49.720
You're being very mean to Magic the Gathering.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.720
I'm not. No, I'm not.

47:51.720 --> 47:54.720
This isn't what I'm saying.

47:54.720 --> 48:04.720
What I'm saying is there are things that you don't have to feel peer pressure to be nerdier than you are.

48:04.720 --> 48:05.720
That's what I'm saying.

48:05.720 --> 48:08.720
No, you also don't have to feel peer pressure to not try new things.

48:08.720 --> 48:16.720
That's what I'm saying. Everything that you are worried about, I swear to you, because this person's not going to go around throwing magic cards in everyone's face like,

48:16.720 --> 48:18.720
I'm the king of all magic.

48:18.720 --> 48:25.720
Unless it turns out he is the king of all magic that's been prophesied about for centuries.

48:25.720 --> 48:29.720
There is a king of all magic. He is coming. Praise be his name.

48:29.720 --> 48:31.720
But that's not what this person's doing.

48:31.720 --> 48:39.720
This person is worried about outside scrutiny. It doesn't fucking exist. I swear to you it doesn't exist.

48:39.720 --> 48:42.720
So let's boil it down. This is what I think we're saying.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.720
Take a second. Close your eyes. Don't worry about anyone else.

48:45.720 --> 48:49.720
If you truly don't want to play because you're not interested in doing it, fine.

48:49.720 --> 48:53.720
Then you say, you know what? I've got enough stuff going on. I'm not interested in it. Great.

48:53.720 --> 48:59.720
But if your only hesitancy to not do it is that you're afraid of being judged by other people, try it.

48:59.720 --> 49:03.720
But do remember that you are judged by other people all the time.

49:03.720 --> 49:07.720
You aren't being judged by other people all the time, and if you are, fuck those people.

49:07.720 --> 49:09.720
That's going to have zero...

49:09.720 --> 49:12.720
Because I guarantee they do something that they're embarrassed about.

49:12.720 --> 49:14.720
Yeah, if you live your whole life like...

49:14.720 --> 49:17.720
Maybe they're playing Roker Poker at home constantly, every day.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.720
If you want to play Roker Poker in public, I think you should be able to.

49:20.720 --> 49:22.720
I'm trying to get those laws passed through Congress.

49:22.720 --> 49:25.720
It's a tough putt though.

49:25.720 --> 49:28.720
Public masturbation is a big thing with these people.

49:28.720 --> 49:30.720
What is your hang up?

49:30.720 --> 49:32.720
Prudes?

49:32.720 --> 49:34.720
It's the 60s.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.720
It's not.

49:36.720 --> 49:42.720
It makes me sad for people who have to keep their freak on a leash.

49:42.720 --> 49:46.720
Griffin's not afraid to tell everyone about his Pokemon days.

49:46.720 --> 49:50.720
By which I mean the present.

49:50.720 --> 49:55.720
Now, this day, he's telling everyone about the day that he is in.

49:55.720 --> 50:02.720
I'm not saying go around and write songs about Magic the Gathering and then sing them to people.

50:02.720 --> 50:04.720
That's not what I'm saying.

50:04.720 --> 50:07.720
Because then it's a fetish.

50:07.720 --> 50:13.720
But don't be afraid to do it just because somebody walking by might tweet about it.

50:13.720 --> 50:16.720
Fuck it, man. Life is way too short.

50:16.720 --> 50:20.720
What if Steve Buscemi plays Magic and you don't get to be friends with Steve Buscemi

50:20.720 --> 50:23.720
because he wants to play Magic the Gathering with you and you're afraid to try it?

50:23.720 --> 50:30.720
If you're not embarrassed about it, there's nothing anybody can do that can hurt you.

50:30.720 --> 50:35.720
You're doing it. You're owning it. You're living it. That's great.

50:35.720 --> 50:42.720
What I'm saying is, if you're embarrassed about it, it doesn't jive with your own sense of self,

50:42.720 --> 50:45.720
then you shouldn't feel like you have to do it.

50:45.720 --> 50:53.720
It's okay to think that things aren't for you or they're not how you want to conduct yourself, I guess is what I'm saying.

50:53.720 --> 50:57.720
I'm just saying everyone should watch the hit Jim Carrey movie, Yes Man.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.720
Don't watch the Yes Man.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.720
Yes. Yes. Watch the Yes Man. Say yes.

51:01.720 --> 51:02.720
Okay.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.720
Because it's the sequel to Liar Liar, which everyone loved.

51:04.720 --> 51:06.720
Why didn't they just call it that?

51:06.720 --> 51:11.720
This is literally, we had this conversation on the last podcast and I edited it out.

51:11.720 --> 51:12.720
Really?

51:12.720 --> 51:14.720
I swear to God.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.720
I want to have it again.

51:16.720 --> 51:19.720
I feel like I maybe didn't make my-

51:19.720 --> 51:21.720
I understand what you're saying, but there is-

51:21.720 --> 51:28.720
I don't want to come off as hypocritical because I do review video games for a living, but there are levels of being nerdy that I can't get into.

51:28.720 --> 51:33.720
I'm overweight. I've got some strikes. I'm pasty. I've got some strikes against me.

51:33.720 --> 51:38.720
There are levels of nerddom that I cannot embrace as a rule.

51:38.720 --> 51:44.720
I played Magic a couple of times in high school. I sat down, had somebody walk me through it, teach me how to play it, played a game or two.

51:44.720 --> 51:49.720
It wasn't for me. It wasn't something I picked up on and I've continued on to this day.

51:49.720 --> 51:54.720
But leading up to it, it was my friend Eric and he kept saying, oh, come on, it's really great.

51:54.720 --> 51:57.720
And I didn't want to play it because it was, quote, uncool.

51:57.720 --> 52:03.720
And then I played it and was like, oh, I could see where someone would totally get into this, but this is not for me.

52:03.720 --> 52:05.720
This is not something I'm going to dedicate my life to.

52:05.720 --> 52:11.720
But like, okay, here's an example. SCA guys, right?

52:11.720 --> 52:22.720
They're in the park, they've got lances, they've got armor, and they're morphing, I think is what they're doing.

52:22.720 --> 52:26.720
They're morphing is what they're doing.

52:26.720 --> 52:29.720
Do I think that would be fun to do for an afternoon? Of course I do.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.720
But I also know you can't unring that bell.

52:32.720 --> 52:37.720
But that's a bad example because that is tantamount to medieval swing dancing.

52:37.720 --> 52:42.720
Basically, yes, right? You could do it on your lawn and you're not.

52:42.720 --> 52:45.720
Nobody does Magic the Gathering as a performance art.

52:45.720 --> 52:49.720
So if someone can figure that out, I will kickstart it.

52:49.720 --> 52:56.720
What I'm saying, though, is if this person plays Magic and really likes it and it makes them happy to play it,

52:56.720 --> 53:02.720
if you just own it, then you're not going to feel embarrassed about it.

53:02.720 --> 53:08.720
If you don't let it define yourself, if you just say, yeah, it's a thing I do, whatever, it's fun, I enjoy doing it.

53:08.720 --> 53:10.720
Yes, that is the key, Griffin. You're right.

53:10.720 --> 53:13.720
That is the salient point that I want to get across.

53:13.720 --> 53:16.720
If you're not embarrassed about it, then don't worry about it.

53:16.720 --> 53:18.720
But I'm saying that's a switch.

53:18.720 --> 53:22.720
No, but I think you're using the word embarrassed where you should say if you don't like it, if you don't enjoy it.

53:22.720 --> 53:24.720
That's not what we're saying at all.

53:24.720 --> 53:32.720
What I'm saying is the embarrassment in your brain, and I swear to God, this is true, it's a switch, and you can flip it.

53:32.720 --> 53:41.720
You can flip that switch from, like, I used to be embarrassed to, like, fucking ride the bus in Chicago and play my Nintendo DS.

53:41.720 --> 53:46.720
I would not do that because I didn't like people watching me play video games.

53:46.720 --> 53:50.720
But I flipped that switch eventually and I realized that this is a thing I want to do on here.

53:50.720 --> 53:53.720
It's a great way to pass the time. I'm going to do it.

53:53.720 --> 53:56.720
And then, like, it seriously is as easy as that.

53:56.720 --> 54:06.720
We spent a long time on this question, but I think, I don't know, it's a thing that comes up really, really frequently for me.

54:06.720 --> 54:26.720
But, like, yes, I get your point. I understand what you're saying, but that level of, like, it's not as easy as you're making it seem because that level of social recalibration, deciding that something isn't, is appropriate socially, like, just deciding it for yourself.

54:26.720 --> 54:28.720
It doesn't matter if it's appropriate.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.720
That doesn't always fly, like, because you still do live in a society.

54:31.720 --> 54:38.720
Like, it's the same reason I, like, I think sweatpants are comfortable, but I'm not wearing them every day because that's not...

54:38.720 --> 54:45.720
What I'm saying is if you wear those sweatpants on a bus and fucking 55 people on that bus see you and all say,

54:45.720 --> 54:52.720
look at this fucking goon in his sweatpants and then they go home to their families at night, they are not going to talk about your goddamn sweatpants.

54:52.720 --> 54:56.720
They're not going to remember that you exist. You're dead to them.

54:56.720 --> 55:05.720
That's, listen, like, this is not a message of sunshine and flowers. Like, you are so fucking insignificant that maybe 10 people are going to remember you after you die.

55:05.720 --> 55:14.720
And those 10 people sure as fuck aren't going to remember that you played Magic cards. I guarantee goddamn T it.

55:14.720 --> 55:15.720
So, good luck.

55:15.720 --> 55:18.720
Like, life is meaningless. Life is meaningless, I guess.

55:18.720 --> 55:22.720
And, like, you're super insignificant and you're probably not going to be famous.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.720
If you get famous, then, yeah, maybe you shouldn't be playing Magic cards.

55:25.720 --> 55:30.720
But, Steve Buscemi, if you're listening, and I hope that you are, probably put them down.

55:30.720 --> 55:32.720
Or maybe you should play Magic cards.

55:32.720 --> 55:36.720
Maybe you should. You could lead the fucking revolution like Vin Diesel when he's like, yeah, I play D&D.

55:36.720 --> 55:41.720
Like, he fucking started the movement and he made it easier for the rest of us and thank you Vin Diesel.

55:41.720 --> 55:49.720
But, like, seriously, nobody gives a shit. Zero people give a shit. There are zero shits to be given.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.720
Unless you wear sweatpants every day.

55:51.720 --> 55:53.720
No, even then.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.720
No, Griffin. I'm sorry. I have to stand my ground.

55:55.720 --> 56:02.720
It's so extreme that I could walk around Austin with 10 fake dicks attached to my body.

56:02.720 --> 56:10.720
And I could run around and I could be the fun guy who runs into people and slaps them with his fake dicks as he jogs down the street.

56:10.720 --> 56:19.720
I could ride a fucking jazzy and I could use a giant fake dick as a lance and I could run it into people.

56:19.720 --> 56:25.720
I could beat someone to death in the street with a fake dick and in a year and a half nobody would remember me.

56:25.720 --> 56:33.720
This is, like, you think I'm joking but I'm being 100% serious. I could be the fake dick murderer and I would not be remembered.

56:33.720 --> 56:42.720
But what I'm saying is that, yes, while you may be technically correct, that behavior becomes your defining aspect.

56:42.720 --> 56:48.720
Nobody's gonna say, man, the fake dick murderer has gray hair. It's just not going to be something they know.

56:48.720 --> 56:54.720
You're right. But what I'm saying is in 10 years they're going to be at dinner and someone's gonna say,

56:54.720 --> 56:59.720
do you remember the fake dick murderer? And the other person's gonna say, no, I don't.

56:59.720 --> 57:04.720
I don't remember what my wife looks like and I've been away from my house for six hours.

57:04.720 --> 57:15.720
I'm not joking. These are things that I seriously think about when I think about whether or not I should do this thing in public.

57:15.720 --> 57:23.720
You make such a small impact in the world that nobody's gonna give a shit. Just play Magic Cards.

57:23.720 --> 57:29.720
Everybody play Magic Cards. This podcast is sponsored by Wizards of the Coast. Thank you, Wizards of the Coast.

57:29.720 --> 57:37.720
They are paying us exclusively in energy. We did like three questions this week because of this question.

57:37.720 --> 57:55.720
I'll be honest with you. I feel like this is one of the few times where the differences in our age is dictating these answers.

57:55.720 --> 58:02.720
I do think it's okay to care about what people think about you.

58:02.720 --> 58:05.720
Now let me weigh in because you guys have been arguing for like 20 minutes.

58:05.720 --> 58:15.720
It's just occurred to me that I feel this same way, but about things in the reverse, like joining a fantasy football league.

58:15.720 --> 58:19.720
If someone was like, play my D&D game, I'm like, okay, totally cool.

58:19.720 --> 58:28.720
But if somebody was like, play in my fantasy baseball, fantasy football, March Madness thing, I would go, oh, I'm gonna look stupid.

58:28.720 --> 58:39.720
I gotta tell you, I'm right there. My friend Justin Minsker has asked me I think to be on two different leagues of like a bowling league and a kickball league.

58:39.720 --> 58:47.720
Both times I was like, no, that's not for me. Just because I would kick the ball and it would hit a child and then I would be embarrassed.

58:47.720 --> 58:54.720
That's the same thing. You're right. I've come to terms with the kind of person that I am.

58:54.720 --> 59:02.720
And that person is kind of nerdy and enjoys watching sports. Yeah, I'm embarrassed to try and crossover.

59:02.720 --> 59:06.720
But this is what I'm saying. Travis is exactly right.

59:06.720 --> 59:13.720
This guy has come to terms with the person that he is.

59:13.720 --> 59:19.720
And I think it's okay to come to terms with yourself being a person who wouldn't play a fantasy card game.

59:19.720 --> 59:23.720
But I disagree because I think you should at least try. I don't think you can.

59:23.720 --> 59:29.720
Did you try kickball? Yeah, when I was fucking nine years old.

59:29.720 --> 59:31.720
I have no pleasant memories from the experience.

59:31.720 --> 59:40.720
I'm just saying that I think it's it's really easy to say, you know, live like your diet and it doesn't matter what other people think and you're insignificant and they won't care.

59:40.720 --> 59:50.720
Until you're actually in that moment where you're playing Magic the Gathering and somebody walks by and snickers behind their hand and suddenly you feel like a tiny, you know, insignificant person.

59:50.720 --> 59:55.720
If you let that kind of shit bother you, then your life is going to be just miserable.

59:55.720 --> 59:58.720
No, no, no. I'm not saying I'm not saying that you should let it bother you.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:09.720
I'm saying that as much as I would love it to be a switch that flips, it's not like you've got to convince yourself and it's a constant thing to remind yourself not to care what other people think.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:24.720
But I still don't think like that's not even what I'm talking like if somebody wants to to judge like that, like somebody wants to get a kick because their personal like adjudication of what's cool doesn't grok with yours.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.720
Like that's like fuck that guy. I'm with Griffin on that.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:39.720
Like I think, yeah, screw them. I'm just saying that it's OK to have a series of guidelines for yourself in the way in which you want to to.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.720
Yes, but I also completely rob yourself of a positive experience.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:52.720
I remember I remember going to the Bob Dylan concert with you, Justin, and sitting there and like everybody else is on their feet and dancing and me going, you know, this isn't my usual way of enjoying a concert.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:59.720
And I'm not that big into Bob Dylan. And you looked at me and said, you're never going to see Bob Dylan in concert again.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:10.720
You should get up and enjoy this. And I did end up having a great time in spite of myself because I just let myself do it and didn't worry about anything or try to like rob myself of a positive.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:22.720
The problem with your the problem with creating your self-identity, like you're talking about, Justin, and knowing the kind of person that you are and using those as guidelines is that's that's fine. And that's a great way to like live your life with that guiding light.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:34.720
But the very first time that keeps you from doing something awesome that would become a new defining like thing in your life, it's all fucking it's all fucking forfeit.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.720
It's all it's it's all for not.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:44.720
That's accurate. I'm just like I say where you're coming from. I one of my friends invited me to go play golf.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:54.720
And it's like I've never played before. I'm not an athletic person. I knew I was going to fucking humiliate myself because that is a game that requires both physical prowess and accuracy.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.720
And I was I was embarrassed and I was embarrassed like my first few holes because I shot it and I hit a child.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.720
It's a big problem for me. It's a big theme.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:12.720
But but then like I had a great time and I want to go play it more like it do it do as much new shit as you possibly can because that's the only way that you can know whether or not you're going to like it.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:19.720
YOLO. You had some really good advice there and then you completely ruined it. ROLOS.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:26.720
Okay. Frodo. There it is. We've been recording for about six hours.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:37.720
I feel like we didn't bring any goofs. No I think you got some goofs in there but I think we got some real like we got that advice that like is broad.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:43.720
I feel like Delilah right now. Can I can I. I'll tell you what's fucking me.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:49.720
And maybe this will help to inform I have like in my head ideas of people who I think are cool.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:54.720
Right. Like oh man that's a cool person. That's the kind of person I'd like to be.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:10.720
And there are some parts of all culture not just nerd culture but anything watching bad TV whatever you know like that don't that I think to myself I let I get the thought of like man that person would never do this.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:22.720
And like that's and but like and that's the thought that I have like I think that person is cool and I think that person lives like the sort of life that I would like to have or be perceived of having.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.720
And then but there's no way that they would be caught doing this thing.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:38.720
We're 114 episodes in and from going over Yahoo Answers and everything that people have asked us you don't think that that person that you think is infallibly cool goes home and does something.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.720
That's what I'm saying like uncool or just super weird.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.720
Straight real talk. Do you think I'm cool Justin. Do you think I'm a cool person.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720
I think you're cool dude.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:55.720
OK when I was 15 I spent probably eight hundred dollars on Pokemon cards.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:02.720
Like you can't because if everybody else is thinking like that and I think a majority of the people are then they're not like airing out their secrets.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.720
There's no way to really know like what a person is like until you like marry them.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:21.720
That's basically that's basically it like there's no way of knowing what kind of shit a person is into if they are also living their life like embarrassed of the things that make them happy.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.720
So inspirational advice YOLO.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.720
So YOLO.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.720
Seriously YOLO.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.720
I think you should.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.720
But do do play it in private though because it may not may not work for you.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.720
You should also play it in private because it's not really that fun to watch.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.720
It's like the most boring game ever.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.720
Pokemon cards though.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.720
Oh that game has at least half the cards are racist.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.720
So you don't want to say them out loud.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.720
You know it's great strip Pokemon cards.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720
Yeah yeah yeah.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.720
You know what I like is strip out Poker Roker Roker poker strip something.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.720
How are you.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:03.720
Can I ask how you're playing Poker Roker without it being strip.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:12.720
I play reverse Roker Poker where like I put on more Al Roker masturbates while watching you do the things that you do.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.720
I just have him give me like some tips about the weather.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:23.720
You know he wants to know what's going on on your neck of your penis.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.720
I answer is a small tie.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:26.720
Yeah yeah.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.720
I got a small tie down there.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.720
I won that hand.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.720
Now you have to tell me what's going on in Des Moines.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.720
Well otherwise but do it slow.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.720
Take it slow for me.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.720
You put a few more pounds on.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.720
Hey wait now we can't get into creepy.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:50.720
No I'm just saying I liked it better when there was more Al to jerk off to.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.720
OK I've got jerkable.

Of course it's a comedy advice show as you've certainly gathered over the past 20.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.720
There is a nice parabola of like helpfulness there.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.720
We came down nicely.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.720
This is this is this is what a literarist would call the descending action.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:19.720

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:10.720
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which which you should be which you should be listening to.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.720
You should also listen to the other Long Winters albums.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720
I listen to it.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.720
I've been flying around a lot lately.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.720
I've been listening to to the whole discography.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.720
So so get up on that.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.720
You should also be listening to all the other Max Fund podcasts.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.720
Jordan Jessica, Throwing Shade, all of them.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.720
And I've been on a big kick of audiobooks this summer.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.720
And if you haven't listened to the audiobook version of John Hodgman's books, you know, more information you require in the areas of my expertise.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.720
I don't know if that is all is out on audiobook yet.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.720
But if you get a chance, make sure you listen to them.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.720
They're just wonderful.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720
They're great.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.720

What?

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.720
