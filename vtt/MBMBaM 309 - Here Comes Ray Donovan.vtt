00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.280
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:47.280 --> 00:51.520
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.520 --> 00:58.960
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. We usually come up with topical humor, quote-unquote,

00:58.960 --> 01:05.200
for both. The only problem is all the topics, they suck ass. Yeah, a lot of the topics suck ass

01:05.200 --> 01:11.920
this week, just like not a lot of real gut busters, but you know what? You don't come to

01:11.920 --> 01:18.800
us for that. I'm of the opinion that things will improve. They statistically almost have to at this

01:18.800 --> 01:29.760
point, but we combed the news, scrolled through several pages, and tried to find some happy

01:29.760 --> 01:37.760
headlines to just brighten everybody's day. So good news. Good news. Ray Donovan's coming back

01:38.560 --> 01:45.440
for big season four. Big fourth season. Fourth season for Ray Donovan and gang. First of all,

01:45.440 --> 01:54.000
thank you Showtime Stars. I think that's it. Thanks to Showtime Stars for bringing us back.

01:54.000 --> 02:04.000
Ray Donovan, the handyman with a heart that fixes those around him just as he's fixing their windows

02:04.000 --> 02:11.360
and stuff. Here's what I know about Ray Donovan. I saw a commercial once and he walked into a hotel

02:11.360 --> 02:17.440
room and Jon Voight was sitting there and Jon Voight had a gun. Now, Ray Donovan's just there

02:17.440 --> 02:22.320
to fix your fucking radiator, Mr. Voight. So maybe calm that shit down for like a second.

02:23.200 --> 02:32.320
But you know what? It's back. It's back. June 26th. It premiered last night or Sunday depending on

02:32.320 --> 02:37.360
whether or not you're recording this with us right now or you're listening to it in the future.

02:37.360 --> 02:44.800
Fans of Ray Donovan rejoiced. Ray's back. Hey, Ray. Ray's back. A ray of sunshine, they said.

02:44.800 --> 02:51.920
Fuck. What kind of relationships for Ray Donovan in the fourth season of it?

02:54.240 --> 02:59.760
Well, he's got eight kids and they're quite a handful, I bet.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.960
Four from his marriage and four from his wife's previous marriage. How will the two

03:04.960 --> 03:10.560
families ever come together? And one is the cyber clone of Jon Voight and that's the ninth child.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.960
Four seasons should have big impacts on all the storylines and I think it's good news

03:17.920 --> 03:24.560
for people who watch Ray Donovan that he's back. And I think I have heard scuttlebutt through the

03:25.200 --> 03:33.200
grapevine that this will be that they finally caught up to the books. So now season four,

03:33.200 --> 03:36.720
they have actually gotten ahead of the book. So there will be stuff happening

03:36.720 --> 03:40.960
that you haven't been able to read about in the Ray Donovan universe before now.

03:40.960 --> 03:48.000
So it should be all new, rough, raw, pure Ray. I heard a lot of rumors vis-a-vis

03:49.600 --> 03:56.560
Liev Shriver's dick is in every episode as a contractual obligation.

03:56.560 --> 04:03.040
But not attached. What they do is they photoshop it into pictures in the background.

04:03.680 --> 04:08.160
And when you look in the mantle and you see like family pictures somewhere in there

04:08.160 --> 04:09.520
is Liev Shriver's dick.

04:09.520 --> 04:16.000
But it's another character and they call it Greg Donovan, which doesn't make any fucking sense.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.760
God, I love this show. I'm so glad it's back for a fourth season on Starz.

04:19.760 --> 04:26.880
One time we saw Liev Shriver in Glengarry Glen Ross and during curtain call,

04:26.880 --> 04:31.680
we were in the front row and my dad said, thank you. And Liev Shriver pointed at my dad and said,

04:31.680 --> 04:37.760
no, thank you. So I'm really excited that Ray Donovan is back for another season.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.440
Liev Shriver finally getting the respect that he deserves.

04:41.440 --> 04:45.280
A Showtime or Starz agent was in the audience, saw that interaction and said,

04:45.280 --> 04:48.320
that's the kind of class that I want to give a Ray Donovan to.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.960
For four seasons, at least.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.600
At least four seasons, if not eight.

04:54.640 --> 04:59.280
You just can't go wrong if you're a Ray Donovan fan with the news.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.880
The only news currently that is good for Ray Donovan.

05:04.880 --> 05:09.600
Now is this going to be the season where he finally fixes his dad's very broken toilet?

05:09.600 --> 05:13.120
It's kind of his white. It's kind of his white whale as a handyman, huh?

05:13.120 --> 05:14.560
His white porcelain whale.

05:14.560 --> 05:19.840
Yeah, he probably would fix it, but probably not the way 2016 is going.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.600
He'll probably try to fix it and it'll blow up and cut his butt off.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.240
I'll fucking...

05:24.240 --> 05:27.040
Ray Donovan, please don't die.

05:27.040 --> 05:35.120
Please don't die, Ray Donovan. You're the only good thing the world has left, Ray Donovan.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.640
I'm literally on my RSS feed right now, just looking for a little...

05:39.920 --> 05:43.840
What the fuck? The Google RSS thing got shut down?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.160
Fuck! What the fuck is happening?

05:47.280 --> 05:49.600
It's okay, Griffin. Ray Donovan will fix us all.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.480
Ray Donovan's back for four seasons.

05:52.480 --> 05:58.000
Maybe Ray Donovan's fourth season premiere is the global moon landing

05:58.000 --> 06:00.720
that we all need to unite as a people and remember there's more that unites us.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.000
Do you remember when we all used to have differences and problems

06:04.000 --> 06:07.680
and we all used to fight about what I can't even remember?

06:07.680 --> 06:12.560
But then Ray Donovan not only fixes dad's toilet, but also fixed us all.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.280
But fucking, that's the thing, it brings us all together.

06:15.280 --> 06:20.080
Everybody starts watching it and then Showtime or Starz jacks up the subscription fee,

06:20.080 --> 06:23.920
leaving the three of us to start an underground Ray Donovan streaming network.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.040
You can't stop the fucking signal, Starz or Showtime.

06:28.000 --> 06:28.880
One of those two.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.280
One of you? Maybe both?

06:32.320 --> 06:33.600
We're getting pretty excited about Ray Donovan.

06:33.600 --> 06:40.000
You can have your episodes of Ray Donovan for $100 a piece.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.120
I'm Starz or Showtime.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.760
I'll probably just head to my local watering hole for one of the Ray days,

06:49.760 --> 06:54.720
which is where they have everybody over and put Ray Donovan up on a big screen and everybody,

06:54.720 --> 06:57.600
because you don't want to be left out when the spoilers start a coming

06:58.320 --> 07:00.560
for Ray Donovan, the season four premiere.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.280
Season four of Ray Donovan.

07:01.280 --> 07:06.400
You can stick around for Ray Donovan trivia night, Ray Donovan karaoke.

07:06.400 --> 07:10.320
You know, it's a whole event, you know, and I've made a lot of good Ray fans.

07:10.320 --> 07:10.880
You know what I mean?

07:10.880 --> 07:14.880
Like, yeah, it's me and them, you know, we're in this together.

07:14.880 --> 07:19.840
And then you get that Chris Hardwick hosted after show Donovan's boys.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.720
Uh-huh.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.800
And each week they have one of the children on, one of the nine kids on to talk about,

07:28.800 --> 07:31.360
like, just what they're going through.

07:31.360 --> 07:35.440
My dream is that somewhere Leo Schreiber is listening to this and saying,

07:35.440 --> 07:36.240
oh, it's really nice.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.320
Hey, thanks guys.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.120
Thanks guys.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.240
I'm glad I can help, you know, sometimes you question your impact of the,

07:42.240 --> 07:45.760
your art on this world and it's nice to know that I've made a difference.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.760
I don't know where you're getting some of the stuff about me being a handyman,

07:49.760 --> 07:53.120
but art is interpretation by definition.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.680
So maybe you're talking about a different show, but that's okay.

07:55.680 --> 07:56.800
You know, press is press.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.020
Yeah.

07:58.020 --> 08:02.340
Press is press.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.700
Go watch Ray Donovan.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.620
Please, please watch Ray Donovan.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.020
Season four.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.180
Please watch Ray Donovan.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.300
Please watch Billions.

08:16.180 --> 08:17.220
Please watch Billions.

08:18.580 --> 08:19.780
Please watch Ray Donovan.

08:19.780 --> 08:25.940
Please watch, you can stop watching Homeland,

08:25.940 --> 08:27.540
but watch Billions and Ray Donovan.

08:28.260 --> 08:31.540
Who would have the fucking stomach for Homeland right now?

08:31.540 --> 08:32.100
Nobody.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.460
Yeah, that's, that's what I'm saying.

08:33.460 --> 08:33.960
It's gone.

08:35.860 --> 08:39.460
If they shot a new season in 24 right now, like Jack Bauer would go,

08:39.460 --> 08:40.500
I don't even know what to do.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.780
I don't know where to start.

08:41.780 --> 08:42.660
I got nothing.

08:42.660 --> 08:43.620
I got nothing.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.300
I'm going to go watch Ray Donovan.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.420
It'll be him running around for 24 hours just gilling everybody.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.780
Be cool, get on the ground.

08:51.780 --> 08:52.280
Be cool.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.220
I'll kill your family if you don't be cool.

08:55.220 --> 08:57.460
Everybody just be cool for two seconds.

08:57.460 --> 09:01.620
Just if we can hold out until June 26th, we can all watch Ray Donovan.

09:01.620 --> 09:02.260
That's it.

09:02.260 --> 09:09.140
The new season of 24 takes place from noon June 25th to noon June 26th.

09:09.140 --> 09:12.980
And he's just trying to make it home to watch Ray Donovan.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.580
Fucking Ray Donovan street team.

09:14.580 --> 09:17.140
Oh man.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.020
Sometimes when we, when we talk about stuff on the show,

09:20.020 --> 09:22.020
it turns into a thing where people start like,

09:22.580 --> 09:26.740
sending us all the like relevant, like every link ever that connects to that thing.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.260
Please, please don't do this.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.700
Please don't do that with Ray Donovan.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.540
I want to keep it pure in my heart.

09:31.540 --> 09:33.220
Give me that, drown me in Donovan.

09:33.860 --> 09:37.300
Drown me, bury me in Liev Shriver.

09:39.380 --> 09:42.420
I'm, I, I, this is it though, right?

09:42.420 --> 09:43.540
This is the only one.

09:43.540 --> 09:46.580
And this is the only little treasure that we've got now.

09:47.380 --> 09:47.940
Yeah.

09:47.940 --> 09:48.740
Thank you, Liev.

09:48.740 --> 09:50.340
Let's do advice questions.

09:51.220 --> 09:51.540
Yeah.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.100
Cause I really, I really don't want to be a bummer,

09:54.100 --> 09:58.420
but we're recording this Friday morning and some stuff just happened.

09:59.380 --> 10:02.180
And we're, we're just going to do our best.

10:02.180 --> 10:03.140
And by stuff just happened.

10:03.140 --> 10:04.900
I mean, they announced Ray Donovan season four.

10:04.900 --> 10:05.780
Please read a question.

10:05.780 --> 10:06.500
I'm fucking dying.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.420
Um, there's, uh, unfortunately there's Griffin.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.500
I'm looking through the news.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.100
There's really nothing else.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.220
That's, uh, didn't cheer anybody up or anything worth talking.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.060
I want to merge squad.

10:19.060 --> 10:19.940
Oh boy.

10:19.940 --> 10:20.420
Yes.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.380
Right when we needed it.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.540
I want to merge squad.

10:24.260 --> 10:26.180
Right there at the top, huh?

10:26.180 --> 10:29.860
Well, it's, it's, it's fucking, it is literally breaking news, Travis.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.180
The nastiest boy has come to roost.

10:33.060 --> 10:33.460
Yeah.

10:33.460 --> 10:37.540
We are, uh, fucking, I refuse.

10:37.540 --> 10:42.820
I refuse to give into this current of negativity.

10:42.820 --> 10:43.940
I refuse.

10:43.940 --> 10:47.940
We will continue to be the Island, that bright Island in this river.

10:47.940 --> 10:54.740
And right now this bright Island is going to talk about the Burger King Mac and Cheetos.

10:54.740 --> 10:55.300
That's right.

10:55.940 --> 10:56.660
That's right.

10:56.660 --> 10:57.220
It happened.

10:58.180 --> 10:58.980
Burger King.

10:58.980 --> 11:06.500
I'm trying really hard with my voice to make this sound positive and not also depressing news.

11:08.500 --> 11:14.340
See if you can tell the times when I falter, they will be plentiful and noticeable.

11:14.340 --> 11:14.900
Yeah.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.980
I want to much Burger King.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.260
This is the much squad.

11:18.260 --> 11:21.460
Um, Burger King is adding the, um, Mac and Cheetos.

11:21.460 --> 11:25.860
Would you call, would you call Burger King a featured player in the much squad segment?

11:25.860 --> 11:29.460
If it feels like they're, they're really trying some stuff out.

11:29.460 --> 11:32.180
They're really seeing what sticks on the old wall.

11:32.180 --> 11:32.900
You know what I mean?

11:32.900 --> 11:33.380
Yeah.

11:33.380 --> 11:36.980
Which is the way that I didn't even get to talk about the Waparito cause they have gone.

11:36.980 --> 11:41.060
So like also the Waparito just like two for that.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.700
But let's talk about the Burger King Mac and Cheetos.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.340
What is that?

11:44.340 --> 11:44.740
Okay.

11:44.740 --> 11:50.500
Well these fucking people took Mac and cheese bites, which are already an abomination.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.740
They're like chunks of Mac and cheese that are fried.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.940
You ever look at Mac, you ever look at a big bowl of Mac and cheese and think like, I would

11:55.940 --> 11:58.340
love to stick my fingers in and on that.

11:59.380 --> 12:04.100
It's deep fried Mac and cheese shaped like a large Cheeto puff and then coated.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.620
Nothing we've heard so far.

12:05.620 --> 12:10.740
Nothing we've heard so far and then, uh, coated with crispy Cheeto flavor.

12:10.740 --> 12:16.660
What much squad is about is bringing you the direct line from these companies, uh, uh,

12:16.660 --> 12:23.940
uh, that what they want to get across, you know what I'm saying?

12:23.940 --> 12:25.860
Like what their message is because I don't care.

12:25.860 --> 12:28.980
I know there's a bunch of people on YouTube that'll probably like review this item or

12:28.980 --> 12:29.380
whatever.

12:29.380 --> 12:33.460
I do not, I give not a crap about that.

12:33.460 --> 12:39.540
Can I just say real quick, do you remember a time in like the mid two thousands when

12:39.540 --> 12:42.420
it was all about like maybe people want salads?

12:43.220 --> 12:44.580
Yeah, that was weird.

12:44.580 --> 12:49.700
We've got like a walnut, cranberry, feta cheese salad and now it's like, Hey, trash

12:49.700 --> 12:52.260
people, you know what?

12:52.260 --> 12:55.300
Instead of those French fries, how about a little bit of yogurt?

12:55.300 --> 12:56.180
Oh no.

12:56.180 --> 13:00.500
You want to eat a literal trash bag full of macaroni and cheese, huh?

13:00.500 --> 13:00.900
Okay.

13:01.700 --> 13:09.060
Um, so this is the lead quote in, from the press release about the Burger King Mac and

13:09.060 --> 13:09.460
Cheetos.

13:09.460 --> 13:15.860
And I know they didn't, I know that they did this earlier in the week, but just in context

13:15.860 --> 13:17.700
is pretty great.

13:17.700 --> 13:23.220
Here's the quote, Mac and Cheetos make the previously unthinkable a reality.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.940
Like, is that what we needed?

13:25.940 --> 13:31.380
Is that, did you look at the global climate and say, Hmm, I think what I need to do is

13:31.380 --> 13:34.100
make the previously unthinkable a reality.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.660
We need to give everyone something to blame.

13:36.660 --> 13:37.380
Hmm.

13:37.380 --> 13:43.700
Gotta, I see, I'm reading another quote here and it's from Burger King food scientist,

13:43.700 --> 13:46.900
Kenneth Bainbridge, who said, now we are all sons of bitches.

13:49.780 --> 13:52.660
We have become Mac and Cheetos, destroyer of worlds.

13:53.620 --> 13:57.380
Um, so it's pretty exciting news.

13:57.380 --> 14:00.900
Um, this is, um, here's another quote.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.100
This is, they don't give these to specific people, by the way.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.860
They just say Burger King sad.

14:05.860 --> 14:10.260
Wait, is it the Burger King?

14:10.260 --> 14:16.020
The Burger King said for anyone who ever wished they could eat warm Mac and cheese, like they

14:16.020 --> 14:21.380
do a bag of chips, Mac and Cheetos makes the previously unthinkable a reality.

14:22.340 --> 14:27.620
Now with this cheesy treat, everyone can snack on the go when they're on route to the beach.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.900
Good luck out there or during a summer road trip.

14:32.900 --> 14:36.900
Plan frequent stops, hope there's a rest area nearby.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.820
You just ate Mac and, you ate a dookie bullet, my friend.

14:40.820 --> 14:43.780
You ate Mac and cheese coated in Cheetos.

14:43.780 --> 14:46.580
See you in 15 minutes, Mac and Cheetos.

14:46.580 --> 14:52.020
I hope everyone needs to collect a lot of brochures for local attractions because that

14:52.020 --> 14:57.060
is the opportunity that is about to present itself on our fun summer road trip.

14:57.060 --> 15:00.740
Who's like, I just spent six months on the Atkins diet, get my beach body right.

15:00.740 --> 15:07.860
And I'm going to unspool all of that hard work in the span of one Cheetos bite.

15:07.860 --> 15:08.820
I like that.

15:08.820 --> 15:14.580
For anyone who's ever wondered like or ever wanted to eat Mac and cheese like chips, are

15:14.580 --> 15:19.780
they talking about like 42 people tops that have been like super stoned and they're just

15:19.780 --> 15:23.700
like, I enjoy this Mac and cheese, but I wish I didn't have to use a spoon.

15:24.260 --> 15:28.420
I mean, Travis, a few weeks ago, I probably would agree with your assessment.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.100
But now I'm not so sure.

15:30.100 --> 15:35.380
Maybe that's apparently a lot of people would like to eat Mac and cheese like chips on the

15:35.380 --> 15:37.780
way to the beach, the beach.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.940
Mom, I need to go in the ocean.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.300
I'm fucking coated.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.180
Stay there.

15:42.180 --> 15:42.980
Stay there, Dylan.

15:42.980 --> 15:44.500
You belong to the Merman now.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.180
I wish that Burger King's whole line was like, we didn't want to do this.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.540
This is not our choice.

15:51.540 --> 15:53.220
We didn't want to do this.

15:53.220 --> 15:56.340
You have made us make Mac and Cheetos.

15:56.340 --> 15:57.860
Please, God, free us from this.

15:57.860 --> 16:04.420
Where the Doritos, I've eaten Doritos Locos Tacos and now I feel like I am part of the

16:04.420 --> 16:08.900
problem because I did not know when that product was announced, it would be such an enormous

16:08.900 --> 16:16.340
destabilizing force in the in the food service industry because now contributed to it because

16:16.340 --> 16:21.140
now fucking everybody's just like, what's the thing about Fritos hot dog?

16:21.140 --> 16:22.260
That's nothing.

16:22.260 --> 16:26.580
You can't about a corn dog that's made out of Funyuns.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.580
That would actually probably be good soup.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.540
That would be good as fuck.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.740
Pepsi soup.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.300
So I grab a coffee at the same coffee shop every morning.

16:33.300 --> 16:37.220
This morning, when the barista took my change out of the register, he looked me dead in

16:37.220 --> 16:40.100
the eyes and put my change into the tip jar.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.420
What the fuck is going on?

16:42.420 --> 16:45.620
It's like the fucking purge every day out there now.

16:49.540 --> 16:50.740
I was flustered.

16:50.740 --> 16:51.240
Yeah.

16:51.240 --> 16:56.040
And my response was to put an extra quarter into the tip jar before taking my coffee.

16:58.440 --> 16:58.940
You.

16:59.480 --> 16:59.980
Wow.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.280
Yeah, I guess that's one response.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.720
I guess I wouldn't do the same.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.640
I'm a little miffed in retrospect, but maybe it's not a big deal.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.440
I mean, I was going to give my changes a tip anyway, so it shouldn't have mattered.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.360
Should I have done something different?

17:15.240 --> 17:16.360
Am I good?

17:16.360 --> 17:18.360
And that's from the great Canadian coin couch.

17:18.360 --> 17:24.760
And in Canada, they got those dollar coins, those two dollar coins, so that change could

17:24.760 --> 17:27.880
have been a significant chunk of money, right?

17:27.880 --> 17:28.680
Loonies and toonies.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.880
Yeah, loonies and toonies, loonies and toonies.

17:29.880 --> 17:30.600
It's a fucking-

17:30.600 --> 17:32.840
Loonies, toonies, throonies.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.280
Spoonies, boonies.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.720
It's just theft.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.520
It's corporate theft, but it's not-

17:40.520 --> 17:41.720
Not only theft, Griffin.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.280
It's not just theft, it's challenge theft.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.680
It's theft that says, say something.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.120
Say something.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.160
You ain't gonna say something?

17:49.880 --> 17:50.840
I'm the coffee guy.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.680
You gotta have this shit.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.200
You need this.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.080
You need this.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.000
And I need this.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.600
And they just take your fucking phone.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.200
I'm gonna sell this on-

18:00.200 --> 18:01.320
Put it in the tin jar.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.400
Sorry, it's in the jar, bud.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.920
Going on Craigslist tomorrow.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.200
It's in the jar.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.400
Don't come back out of the jar.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.400
Once it's in the jar, I don't know what to tell you.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.040
Phone's in the jar.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.560
I'm gonna sell all your contacts to advertisers, idiot.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.200
Here's your cup of mud.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.040
You need this.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.640
Enjoy this shitty muffin.

18:21.000 --> 18:21.480
This muffin-

18:21.480 --> 18:22.360
Show your bad muffin.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.760
This muffin's dry as fuck, but that's okay,

18:24.760 --> 18:26.040
because it's the purge.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.520
Take 10 muffins, just kick in the fucking display case

18:30.520 --> 18:32.360
and start grabbing baked goods,

18:32.360 --> 18:33.880
because no rule's just right.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.960
Even in Canada, I thought you were cool.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.960
I thought you guys were doing okay up there.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.480
Yeah, I thought y'all were doing all right.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.880
This is the problem.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.240
You should be going to Tim Hortons,

18:47.240 --> 18:49.240
because this shit would not happen at Tim Hortons.

18:49.880 --> 18:50.440
That's true.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.680
A local chain where there's accountability.

18:52.680 --> 18:53.560
I agree with you, Trav.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.160
This is the problem.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.840
You go to those mom and pop shops

18:56.840 --> 18:58.680
and they steal your change.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.520
I've always said that.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.800
I've always said that.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.600
Don't trust local business.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.760
The best advice we can give you is

19:06.760 --> 19:08.600
don't let yourself get stolen from,

19:09.240 --> 19:11.720
but that ship has sailed.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.240
Is there any recourse?

19:13.240 --> 19:14.840
Well, the second advice would be

19:14.840 --> 19:16.760
if you do let yourself get stolen from,

19:16.760 --> 19:18.280
don't also give them more.

19:18.280 --> 19:18.680
Yeah, don't-

19:18.680 --> 19:19.160
What?

19:19.160 --> 19:20.440
Yeah, that's not a good way to go.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.640
Does this appease you?

19:22.440 --> 19:25.160
Might I return to your coffee establishment tomorrow

19:25.160 --> 19:26.360
and face no judgment?

19:26.920 --> 19:29.080
Evil happens when good people stand by and say nothing.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.920
You should have taken all the money out of the tip jar

19:30.920 --> 19:32.520
and said, well, it's contaminated now.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.240
This is all mine.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.120
I'm not counting it.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.360
Well, and Justin, super evil happens

19:36.360 --> 19:38.920
when good people then help the bad people

19:38.920 --> 19:41.720
do more bad stuff by giving them more money.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.160
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.680
Is it possible that this coffee shop

19:44.680 --> 19:46.440
is like a Dick's Last Resort kind of deal

19:46.440 --> 19:49.240
where it's like, oh, the baristas are kind of rude to you.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.200
That's the whole thing.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.880
That's not, it's different though.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.880
It's like Dick's Last Resort,

19:53.880 --> 19:56.280
if they took your money and then didn't give you coffee

19:56.840 --> 19:58.200
and then they took your phone

19:58.200 --> 20:00.280
and they sold the contacts on Craigslist.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.280
Basically, yeah.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.360
It's criminal.

20:04.360 --> 20:05.960
I would go to that restaurant.

20:07.800 --> 20:08.920
Just to mix it up?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.040
Just to mix it up.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.080
And you know, just some days you just want to feel

20:13.080 --> 20:14.200
like you're worthless.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.400
You know, not for all day,

20:15.400 --> 20:17.480
but just while you're eating food, you know?

20:17.480 --> 20:19.560
You just want someone to treat you like garbage.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.960
Have you ever been to Dick's Purge Cafe?

20:23.800 --> 20:24.920
It's fucking great.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.240
My brother went there and he got killed,

20:27.240 --> 20:30.440
but it's fine because it's Dick's Purge Cafe.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.360
It's perfect.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.240
It's perfect.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.400
They got a kiosk at the airport.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.120
You can get purged right there before your flight.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.680
You can get purged right there at this spot.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.960
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

20:45.960 --> 20:47.240
How about a Yahoo, huh?

20:47.240 --> 20:49.160
Just give me like fucking a minute.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.600
Can we just pause the show for a minute

20:50.600 --> 20:52.920
so I can just look at a picture of Ray Donovan?

20:54.440 --> 20:55.880
To just recharge the old batteries.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.400
I gotta fill up the meter.

21:01.880 --> 21:02.380
Okay.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.840
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

21:04.840 --> 21:05.400
Thank you, Morgan.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.840
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.480
User Absidal who says,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.400
how was hacking done before the internet existed?

21:16.840 --> 21:18.600
Did people make their own internet?

21:19.880 --> 21:20.280
Update.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.520
I heard computer hacking was being done in the 70s and 80s.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.920
I know the War Games movie was fiction,

21:24.920 --> 21:26.920
but didn't it depict a true to life technique?

21:27.960 --> 21:30.920
I think hackings existed since like the Donovan,

21:30.920 --> 21:35.000
but it used to be just like one Gregorian monk would go to another one

21:35.000 --> 21:37.320
and like open up the book he'd been copying over

21:37.320 --> 21:39.560
and would write like, butt cheeks.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.960
Got you again, Gerald, idiot.

21:44.920 --> 21:45.880
I hacked your book.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.720
I cracked your mainframe, butt cheeks.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.600
I mean, hacking would be a lot different

21:54.600 --> 21:56.840
if you showed up to someone's house and they're like,

21:56.840 --> 21:57.480
can I help you?

21:57.480 --> 21:59.560
You're like, yeah, I'm here to hack your computer.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.840
Please, may I hack your computer, please?

22:02.840 --> 22:06.200
Because I guess I don't even know what that word means.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.720
I'm Ray Donovan, 1970s computer hacker.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.920
I'm here to fix your toilet.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.960
By the way, I need to get on your computer

22:13.960 --> 22:15.640
to learn how to fix your toilet.

22:15.640 --> 22:16.680
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.760
I've got all your files, by which I mean some numbers

22:20.760 --> 22:23.160
that you made your computer add together earlier

22:23.160 --> 22:25.160
because that's basically all it can fucking do.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.440
It would be good in ye olden days

22:30.440 --> 22:32.440
because you'd have abacus hacking,

22:32.440 --> 22:33.720
which would be great

22:33.720 --> 22:35.800
because it would just, you know,

22:35.800 --> 22:38.280
you just screwed a couple beads.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.600
Six, seven, nine.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.760
Damn it, who took my eight?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.200
Somebody took my eight beat away.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.440
This shit used to be on punch cards.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.320
That would be fun too.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.400
You just fucking bite into it with your teeth.

22:49.400 --> 22:49.880
Hacked it.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.160
You're not going to run that program good at all.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.480
Who melted all my wax cylinders?

22:55.480 --> 22:56.200
Hacked.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.640
Go to some hieroglyphic.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.040
You fucking put your butt on it.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.000
Ah, hacked it.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.040
Hacked it.

23:02.040 --> 23:02.520
Got you.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.720
Got you Cleopatra.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.920
You like that shit?

23:06.920 --> 23:10.920
What historical act does this urn represent?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.040
Well, if you read the characters,

23:12.040 --> 23:16.200
smash, you got hacked.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.400
What's all this dust in there?

23:17.400 --> 23:18.920
That's my dad's ashes.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.000
Fuck, ah, Cleo, I'm so sorry.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.040
I goofed up real bad.

23:23.080 --> 23:23.720
I was just trying to-

23:23.720 --> 23:24.920
It was supposed to be a hack.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.040
Do you know what that word means?

23:26.040 --> 23:27.320
I was just trying to hack it.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.360
Oh no.

23:28.360 --> 23:29.240
Oh golly.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.160
Has anyone seen the script for Love's Labors 1?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.360
Oh, sorry Shakespeare.

23:32.360 --> 23:32.920
I hacked it.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.560
I hacked your shit.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.360
I hacked your script.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.440
That means I threw it in the creek with all the swans.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.880
The swans ate your script Shakespeare.

23:39.880 --> 23:40.600
That one's on me.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.840
Got drunk on meat and hacked it.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.960
Nobody's ever going to read K2, King Lear 2.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.080
Sorry.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.200
Everything gets better.

23:50.200 --> 23:50.920
King Lear 2.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.680
By the way, K2 is a sweet name for that.

23:54.680 --> 23:58.760
I hope other people pick that up after the Mighty Ducks movie

23:58.760 --> 24:00.120
and Terminator.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.480
People got into that for a while, huh?

24:01.480 --> 24:03.000
I was thinking about that yesterday.

24:03.000 --> 24:03.500
Equals?

24:04.840 --> 24:06.600
Just the one letter and the number.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.080
And then it was like, I guess we'll go see that.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.200
I mean, we could say the whole thing.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.000
It's not that hard.

24:11.000 --> 24:11.560
This is not.

24:11.560 --> 24:12.360
It's pretty easy.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.040
If this is the hardest episode of this podcast we've ever recorded,

24:19.400 --> 24:21.400
I need there to be fucking like-

24:22.760 --> 24:26.920
I need there to be a Better Call Saul style spin-off of Ray Donovan

24:26.920 --> 24:31.400
starring Jon Voight and maybe he takes three of the kids under his wing

24:31.400 --> 24:33.560
and there's two Ray Donovan shows on the-

24:33.560 --> 24:35.880
Like, that's how fucking bad it's gotten out there.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.400
Travis sent a picture of-

24:39.400 --> 24:40.440
Oh, cool.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.240
Thanks, Trav.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.800
Travis sent a high-res JPEG of Ray Donovan.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.440
That's something I could just sort of look at whenever-

24:48.440 --> 24:49.560
It's not even that big.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.440
Thanks, Trav.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.360
Wait, I fucking skimp on the bytes.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.960
What are you paying by the byte?

24:53.960 --> 24:57.240
This is a very small picture of- It's whatever I can Google, Justin.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.280
I'm doing my best here.

24:58.280 --> 25:02.440
Now, this is a big picture of Ray Donovan, but the quality is extremely bad.

25:02.440 --> 25:06.600
I think I'd rather have small Ray Donovan with the fucking crispness

25:06.600 --> 25:08.760
because this one prominently features the eyes.

25:09.560 --> 25:13.400
Yeah, this looks like somebody took a picture with their phone of Ray Donovan.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.080
The first one's like he's looking directly at me.

25:15.080 --> 25:19.560
I'd love to get zoomed in on this picture, but I can't because it's so small.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.080
Let's see if this one does you better.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.880
Please stop sending me pictures of Ray Donovan.

25:23.880 --> 25:24.360
I will not.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.120
So I just sent you a picture of a man I just found on LinkedIn

25:28.120 --> 25:30.040
whose name is also Ray Donovan.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.320
Do you think it's based on his life?

25:33.320 --> 25:34.440
Can you even imagine?

25:34.440 --> 25:35.640
Maybe it's him.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.800
I understand that we're pressed for time here,

25:37.800 --> 25:41.800
but if you guys don't start sending me bigger, glossier JPEGs,

25:41.800 --> 25:44.040
I don't think I'm going to be able to get through this show.

25:44.040 --> 25:47.640
I need big, big pictures of people named Ray Donovan.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.560
Justin, I can't afford glossy JPEGs of Ray Donovan.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.600
Can you read a fucking question about,

25:56.600 --> 25:58.760
but like try to fit Ray Donovan into it?

26:00.520 --> 26:00.840
Okay.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.240
Okay, I'll do my best.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.320
It's got to be organic though.

26:05.320 --> 26:08.360
I'm just really excited for the fourth season of Ray Donovan to start.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.280
I'm so excited.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.200
I recently took a trip to visit my old college roommate,

26:14.200 --> 26:19.080
Ray Donovan in his new city, New York.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.120
I'm almost certain Ray Donovan takes place in Los Angeles.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.600
Yeah, that sounds better.

26:24.600 --> 26:27.400
I recently took a trip to visit my old college roommate,

26:27.400 --> 26:30.520
Ray Donovan in his new city, Los Angeles, City of Angels.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.360
His current friend group peppered me with questions

26:34.360 --> 26:36.600
about how he was in college,

26:36.600 --> 26:38.600
asking for additional details or explanation

26:38.600 --> 26:40.040
of some of Ray Donovan's stories.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.320
A couple of tales about Ray Donovan caught my attention

26:43.320 --> 26:44.360
for an interesting reason.

26:45.080 --> 26:45.960
They happened to me.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.520
My old roommate, Ray Donovan,

26:48.520 --> 26:52.360
has been using events from my life to regale his current friends.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.400
Is this something I need to address?

26:55.400 --> 26:59.720
Should I let it go and just allow this Gilderoy Lockhart

26:59.720 --> 27:01.880
to profit from my experiences?

27:01.880 --> 27:03.720
That says, help me brothers.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.640
That's from Who Lives Who Dies Who Tells Your Story.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.480
How fucking sick was your life in college?

27:10.520 --> 27:11.640
Probably pretty good.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.240
Like, it sounds like you don't, yeah.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.120
You should be careful before confronting Ray Donovan.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.320
Yeah, that's true.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.120
Like, what did you, like, one time I ate an ATV.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.400
That's weird because Ray Donovan said he did that.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.600
So who's lying here?

27:26.600 --> 27:29.720
That's weird because if you tell that story to his friends,

27:29.720 --> 27:33.560
like, they're gonna think that you're the liar.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.880
That sounds really similar to the story Ray Donovan told us

27:35.880 --> 27:37.320
about the time he ate a go-kart.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.560
I think he might be full of shit.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.880
Wait, did you say you ate a dune buggy?

27:41.880 --> 27:42.680
Wait a minute.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.160
Wait a minute, hold on a second.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.920
Do you think that this is a scenario in which,

27:48.280 --> 27:50.120
sometimes you tell a story enough

27:50.120 --> 27:51.560
that it starts to feel like your own.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.280
This is like a psychological thing

27:54.280 --> 27:56.920
where you eventually, like, tell it enough

27:56.920 --> 27:59.160
that it feels like it's yours.

27:59.160 --> 28:02.200
Okay, I hear that, I've heard that said so much

28:02.200 --> 28:03.400
and it may be true,

28:05.720 --> 28:08.840
but to me, that defense always sounded like you're saying,

28:08.840 --> 28:15.080
I lied so much, I did so much lying,

28:15.080 --> 28:16.680
that it's basically the truth now.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.200
Rather than being angry, you should feel bad for them

28:20.200 --> 28:22.520
when they heard you were coming to visit.

28:22.520 --> 28:27.320
Think about the farcical mid-90s Steve Martin movie level

28:27.320 --> 28:31.800
of twists and turns and hoops they'd have to jump through

28:31.800 --> 28:32.920
to get ready for your visit.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.200
Like, the trailer starts with like, you're coming when?

28:36.200 --> 28:38.280
And then they have to like take down all the photos

28:38.280 --> 28:42.680
all the Photoshop pictures of you and John Voight

28:42.680 --> 28:44.200
that they put up to try to make it seem

28:44.200 --> 28:45.240
like they actually met John Voight

28:45.240 --> 28:47.320
when it was you that met John Voight.

28:47.320 --> 28:50.360
It's like mixed nuts, but with less murder.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.400
Cause I don't know if you guys remember

28:51.400 --> 28:53.240
in that Christmas time movie,

28:53.240 --> 28:56.760
they fucking murder a guy, mixed nuts.

28:56.760 --> 29:00.760
I think if you are visiting this person at most once a year,

29:01.320 --> 29:04.280
this is not a problem that affects your life in any way.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.800
I think that this is like more of an issue

29:07.800 --> 29:10.360
that you need to take stock for future

29:10.360 --> 29:12.440
of like your relationship with this friend

29:12.440 --> 29:15.000
where you're like, how many things have they said to me

29:15.000 --> 29:15.800
that were a lie?

29:17.160 --> 29:20.920
But like, all this would do if you would confront this

29:20.920 --> 29:23.960
is like make you seem like a turd, really.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.040
I mean, this person's trying to build a new life

29:26.040 --> 29:28.120
in a new city and they're trying their best, man.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.280
Making friends in a new place is hard.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.160
Yeah, you gotta lie.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.360
You just gotta lie a lot.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.280
Like if you're gonna, you can't make a few friends

29:34.280 --> 29:37.160
without breaking a few lie eggs is what they say.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.360
I'm not saying it's ideal.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.320
This is clearly a crutch that this person has fallen back on.

29:41.320 --> 29:41.560
Sure.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.480
But like, I don't think you're doing any,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.320
I don't think that this is hurting anyone.

29:47.320 --> 29:49.880
And I think you like confronting them

29:49.880 --> 29:51.560
or going to their new friends and be like,

29:51.560 --> 29:53.240
hey, all those stories were mine

29:54.200 --> 29:58.200
would only serve to like vindicate you in some way.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.360
Like unless it's in some way,

30:00.360 --> 30:03.800
I can't predict hurting their new friend group

30:03.800 --> 30:05.640
that your friend is telling these stories.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.680
I don't think you benefit anything

30:08.680 --> 30:10.280
by calling your friend out.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.640
Trav, I think you're completely right.

30:11.640 --> 30:16.200
Unless, unless they were trying to save you

30:16.200 --> 30:19.720
from being in the extremely unenviable position

30:19.720 --> 30:21.560
of being the person that they told

30:21.560 --> 30:23.080
all their college stories about

30:23.720 --> 30:25.640
and then you've come to visit.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.600
Like if his every story before your business has been like,

30:28.600 --> 30:31.960
and then crazy Rick was like boogity, boogity, boo.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.840
And he burnt down the garbage can

30:34.840 --> 30:36.360
and he pushed it down a hill.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.520
Like all these crazy stories about you,

30:38.520 --> 30:41.000
when you get there, everybody,

30:41.000 --> 30:42.520
there's gonna be so much pressure.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.600
Everybody's gonna be expecting you

30:44.600 --> 30:46.920
to be like so wild and so nutty.

30:46.920 --> 30:49.000
And now you could just be like Sancho Panza.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.040
Just be like, man, I don't know.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.760
I don't know what stunt this guy's gonna pull next.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.520
But I'm just happy to be here for it.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.760
You would roll up to LA and they'd be like,

30:56.760 --> 30:57.480
what do you guys wanna do?

30:57.480 --> 30:58.760
Should we go go-karting?

31:00.680 --> 31:02.920
Come on, eat that go-kart.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.680
No, I actually, I've got a meeting in the morning.

31:04.680 --> 31:08.680
So I need to turn in and I'm, I've got gird now.

31:08.680 --> 31:12.040
I've got gird so I can't eat any more go-karts unfortunately.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.040
That's kind of just sort of a one-time deal.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.160
Every person in their life

31:17.160 --> 31:19.800
can only eat and digest a single go-kart.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.040
So make it count kids, don't throw away your shot.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.240
That's what Hamilton's about.

31:23.960 --> 31:27.080
And it would be like that one full house episode

31:27.080 --> 31:29.480
where Joey was inexplicably a substitute teacher

31:29.480 --> 31:30.680
in Michelle's class.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.360
And Michelle told all her friends

31:32.360 --> 31:34.680
about how sick the bullwinkle impressions are gonna be

31:34.680 --> 31:36.040
as soon as Joey showed up.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.280
And then he showed up as like a normal teacher.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.280
And it was like, all the kids were like,

31:40.280 --> 31:41.400
man, this guy sucks.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.280
I don't know why you thought he was gonna be good.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.680
I was promised some dang bullwinkle impressions.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.680
Yeah, you promised like the really fucking hot puppetry

31:48.680 --> 31:50.600
and sick bullwinkle impressions.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.960
The idea that that would have been more cool

31:53.960 --> 31:55.800
than showing up and just being a teacher

31:55.800 --> 31:57.320
is so baffling to me.

31:57.320 --> 32:00.280
Nowadays in 2016, like that episode would be like,

32:00.280 --> 32:02.440
guys, you're gonna love it.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.720
My uncle Joey's coming.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.000
He's gonna teach the class.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.200
And he's got a bifurcated tongue.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.240
You're gonna love this shit.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.800
It's awesome.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.960
He looks like fucking reptile from Mortal Kombat.

32:13.960 --> 32:14.920
You're gonna love this shit.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.600
Show him the bifurcated tongue, Joey.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.520
And he's like, it makes it so much better for pleasure.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.120
And it's like, Joey, we're 10.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.880
Joey, we're 10, Joey.

32:23.880 --> 32:24.760
Joey, no.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.120
Joey, we're 10.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.720
Put on an episode of Ray Donovan

32:27.720 --> 32:32.040
and let us take our nap time.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.960
Yeah, but who can take a nap

32:33.960 --> 32:35.800
when that fucking peep song kicks in?

32:35.800 --> 32:36.760
You know the one.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.720
Yeah, the one that's like-

32:37.720 --> 32:39.080
Trav, how does that go?

32:39.080 --> 32:43.240
Ray Donovan.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.120
Right, it's like a slow pan of him

32:46.120 --> 32:47.800
driving down the Hollywood Boulevard

32:47.800 --> 32:50.200
like pointing at all the babes and dudes.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.600
Yeah, and then stopping to fix the toilet

32:52.600 --> 32:55.400
as everyone goes, ooh, and lowers their sunglasses.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.880
That's Ray.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.200
Well, you know they changed the theme song for season four.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.320
So it's like, hey, now here he comes.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.440
It's Ray's day.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.320
It has like a much more-

33:07.320 --> 33:09.080
And then they freeze as he like jumps up

33:09.080 --> 33:10.680
and does kind of a yay pose.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.320
He's making his way in LA.

33:13.320 --> 33:16.200
It can be hard out there for a janitor.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.400
It's like crash zoom to his face

33:21.400 --> 33:23.640
and he's just like, point me to the toilet.

33:23.640 --> 33:24.520
Point me to the toilet.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.560
I'll fix it right up.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.200
I hope Ray Donovan never dies.

33:33.880 --> 33:37.080
Ray Donovan, the only good thing going on in the world.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.920
How did it get so bad?

33:42.920 --> 33:45.480
It's like 24 seven purge.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.040
I thought that was a fictional movie.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.160
Here comes Ray.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.400
Fixing it all.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.240
Ray, can you fix my toilet?

33:53.240 --> 33:56.600
And then this fucking toilet reality.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
Ray Donovan, here he comes.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.360
Don't look at the other stuff.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.200
The other stuff fucking sucks.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.320
Crash zoom, point me to the toilet.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.360
Point me to the toilet.

34:08.360 --> 34:09.560
I hope I never die.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.960
Please don't cancel my show.

34:13.960 --> 34:22.040
Everyone needs this.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.880
We should start a preemptive Kickstarter

34:23.880 --> 34:26.200
to make sure that Ray Donovan never gets canceled.

34:27.720 --> 34:28.120
I don't know.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.400
We're thinking about canceling.

34:29.400 --> 34:29.800
Boom!

34:29.800 --> 34:30.840
Two million dollars.

34:30.840 --> 34:31.560
Stop right there.

34:32.680 --> 34:33.400
At this point.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.520
Okay, first off, Travis,

34:36.520 --> 34:37.960
we're going to privately fund Ray Donovan.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.480
We're getting ourselves on the show.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.680
They don't get the money until we definitely get to be in every shot.

34:42.680 --> 34:43.560
That's thing one.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.400
Ray's fund three new neighbors.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.920
The McBird brothers like,

34:46.920 --> 34:49.240
I don't think you'll be able to fix this one, Ray.

34:49.240 --> 34:50.600
Cut to end of episode.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.960
You fix this one, Ray.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.120
That's it.

34:54.120 --> 34:57.160
We just need two lines every episode and I'll be happy.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.240
Spoken in unison like a Greek chorus.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.680
What if Showtime just cancels it?

35:02.680 --> 35:04.280
Because Hope is so cruel.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.440
And they don't want us to have any of that.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.240
So they just cancel Ray Donovan preemptively.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.760
We'll get it streaming on CISO.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.640
We'll do our own sweeted version of Ray Donovan.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.000
Dibs on Ray Donovan.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.960
I call Ray Donovan his penis.

35:17.960 --> 35:18.760
I'm the toilet.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.560
We're all the toilet today, fellas.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.680
Let's go to the money zone.

35:33.320 --> 35:36.040
Okay, my brother and my brother need supported in part by harrys.com.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.360
Have you ever asked yourself why razors are the only products in the drug store?

35:40.360 --> 35:42.200
They're locked behind a plexiglass case.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.160
It's true.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.880
It's a pain in the butt to get at them.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.240
But that's not the...

35:47.240 --> 35:48.680
That's because they're really overpriced.

35:49.320 --> 35:50.280
Harry's isn't.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.480
Harry's gives you a fair price for really great blades.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.120
And you know what?

35:54.120 --> 35:56.280
They've been sending me new blades as they come in

35:56.280 --> 35:59.640
and their new handles are really, really nice.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.760
Hey, there's another good thing.

36:00.760 --> 36:03.720
Ray Donovan and the improvement of Harry's handles.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.520
It's like a katana, this shit.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.520
Like it feels good to the touch.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.440
This is Hattori Hanzo's deal.

36:10.440 --> 36:10.920
You know what?

36:10.920 --> 36:15.320
A lot of times if I'm getting a sub quality shave with expensive blades,

36:15.320 --> 36:17.000
you know, like it's been a couple of shaves

36:17.000 --> 36:18.760
and they're not cutting as well as they used to,

36:18.760 --> 36:21.160
I would just power through because they're so darn expensive.

36:21.160 --> 36:21.880
Now you know what I do?

36:21.880 --> 36:25.160
If it's Harry's and once that blade starts to wear down,

36:25.160 --> 36:25.960
I just pop it off.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.760
I treat myself to a smooth shave every single time I shave.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.400
Harry's has a Truman starter set.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.880
It's a great option for new customers and an amazing deal.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.120
For just $15, you get a razor handle,

36:36.120 --> 36:39.880
moisturizing shave cream and three of Harry's five blade

36:39.880 --> 36:43.000
German engineered razors, but it gets better.

36:43.000 --> 36:43.880
You're not gonna pay $15.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.800
Harry's is gonna give our listeners $5 off your first purchase

36:47.800 --> 36:52.920
at harrys.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.960
That's harrys.com.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.960
Make sure you use the code MYBROTHER.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.400
Travis, so you're talking about Trunk Club

36:59.400 --> 37:01.560
because I know that you're wearing that shit on the reg.

37:01.560 --> 37:05.720
I'm actually wearing my jeans from Trunk Club right now.

37:05.720 --> 37:09.800
Um, we've had questions on this show a lot before where people have said like,

37:09.800 --> 37:10.680
I don't know how to dress.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.920
I'm an adult who doesn't know how to dress.

37:12.920 --> 37:16.520
Well, the good news is that there are people in this world who do know how to dress

37:16.520 --> 37:18.840
and they will help you figure it out.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.720
And suddenly it will all seem so easy to you.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.160
And those people are Trunk Club.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.680
How it works, and I think that this is absolutely genius.

37:26.680 --> 37:29.480
And that does not sound sincere because I, Travis McElroy,

37:29.480 --> 37:31.320
have a really hard time sounding sincere.

37:31.320 --> 37:36.280
But it really is a genius process where basically you talk with a stylist

37:36.280 --> 37:39.560
or you go on and tell them what you need on the website.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.720
They send you all the stuff.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.800
You try on the stuff.

37:43.800 --> 37:44.840
You keep what you like.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.440
You send back what you don't.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.800
And you only pay for what you keep.

37:48.680 --> 37:51.320
So like you're not stuck with a shirt that doesn't fit right

37:51.320 --> 37:53.400
or pants that you don't like the look of.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.520
You only keep what you like.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.680
It's a smooth, easy process.

37:56.680 --> 38:00.680
And like I said, they have stylists who will help walk you through this shit

38:00.680 --> 38:02.680
so you're not feeling like you're on your own going,

38:02.680 --> 38:05.320
I don't know, are these shorts even cool?

38:05.320 --> 38:08.120
Who knows about socks and ties and stuff?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.480
Well, Trunk Club does.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.960
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.800
You type in your measurements, share your likes and dislikes,

38:15.800 --> 38:18.200
and your stylist will help get you set up.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.280
It's not a subscription service.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.840
So you won't be stuck paying for the stuff every month,

38:22.840 --> 38:25.400
even when you don't need it or can't afford it.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.120
You just get what you need and then you get out.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.720
You get your own.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.960
Like I said, shipping is always free

38:31.960 --> 38:34.280
and you have 10 days to try on the clothes and send them back.

38:34.280 --> 38:38.200
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and check it out.

38:39.560 --> 38:44.520
Every day, my office window is right next to our mailbox outside.

38:44.520 --> 38:48.840
Every day, the mailman comes and he dunks that mail in around 11 am,

38:48.840 --> 38:50.200
which is the current time.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.720
While he stares you dead in the eye.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.360
No, and he's always fucking talking.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.680
He's always on a hands-free Bluetooth earbud.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.520
Like I'm not being hyperbolic.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.920
Literally every day, all six days a week,

39:00.920 --> 39:02.040
that he comes and he dunks that mail.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.080
He's always talking.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.640
It's like, who are you always talking to?

39:05.640 --> 39:08.120
Are you just constantly on some sort of like CB radio

39:08.680 --> 39:10.120
with the other male people?

39:11.080 --> 39:12.360
You know, they actually do have this.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.200
I know taxi drivers have those.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.960
Like basically group chat lines,

39:16.680 --> 39:19.400
usually with other people who speak their native language

39:19.400 --> 39:20.840
if they're not native English speakers.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.040
And they just kind of like chat all day.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.000
It's kind of nice actually.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.440
When I'm traveling for work though and I like call Rachel,

39:26.440 --> 39:28.520
I'll talk to her for like maybe 15, maybe 20 minutes

39:28.520 --> 39:30.680
about like how our days were and then bounce.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.840
A fucking mail shift, it's gotta be what?

39:32.840 --> 39:34.440
Like eight hours at least.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.560
And you just constantly ate out.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.400
What do you have to talk about for eight hours?

39:37.400 --> 39:38.040
The mail's pretty-

39:38.040 --> 39:39.880
Seven hours of no, you hang out.

39:39.880 --> 39:40.920
No, you hang out.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.040
The mail's pretty good today.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.040
Anyway, I got a person.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.480
Lots of magazines.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.160
Midway, before you read the jumbotron,

39:47.160 --> 39:49.720
wouldn't it be like mailman's got to take a lunch, right?

39:49.720 --> 39:49.960
Yeah.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.120
Wouldn't it be sweet if you're the next house

39:52.120 --> 39:55.720
at like the one he was going to do right after his lunch?

39:55.720 --> 39:58.040
You just see him sob outside and get our sandwich like,

39:58.040 --> 39:59.000
ah, sorry.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.680
Just sit on the lawn and enjoy sandwich and lemonade.

40:02.680 --> 40:03.960
I'm just going to eat this sandwich.

40:03.960 --> 40:04.760
I'm on break.

40:04.760 --> 40:05.240
Our mail?

40:05.240 --> 40:06.280
No, you can't have your mail.

40:06.280 --> 40:06.680
Our mail?

40:06.680 --> 40:07.400
I'm going to read your mail.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.400
Our mail comes at 12, 15 PM every day.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.920
Always got fucking mayonnaise on it.

40:10.920 --> 40:11.800
I have no idea.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.840
Got some jumbotron messages here.

40:14.840 --> 40:18.680
Folks, the jumbotron inbox is over full, I would say.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.640
Stuff to the gills.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.320
Stuff to the gills.

40:21.320 --> 40:25.720
So normally we would point you here to how you get jumbotrons

40:25.720 --> 40:28.600
on the show, but I think we're like full up through January?

40:28.600 --> 40:29.240
Is that right?

40:30.680 --> 40:31.240
Which is nuts.

40:31.240 --> 40:32.840
Thank you so much for your support.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.760
But we say this all the time.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.800
It really will be a while before you can get a message on the show

40:37.800 --> 40:38.280
now.

40:38.280 --> 40:38.600
Anyway.

40:38.600 --> 40:44.760
So go buy a jumbotron on Adventure Zone, or Sawbones, or Bunker

40:44.760 --> 40:46.680
Buddies, or Canterbury Dog.

40:46.680 --> 40:47.000
I don't know.

40:47.000 --> 40:47.720
Still buffering.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.680
Sawbones doesn't offer the jumbotron service, but still buffering does.

40:50.680 --> 40:51.400
OK.

40:51.400 --> 40:52.520
Schmanners.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.360
I do the jumbotron alone on Adventure Zone.

40:54.360 --> 40:57.480
I don't know if you guys ever listen back to those episodes after I edit them.

40:57.480 --> 41:03.000
But it's all like almost every jumbotron is like a player writing a message to their DM,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.400
or a DM writing a message to their group of players.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.000
It's like almost exclusively.

41:07.000 --> 41:07.800
That's pretty sick.

41:07.800 --> 41:08.440
It's fucking great.

41:08.440 --> 41:08.680
Yeah.

41:08.680 --> 41:09.800
Anyway, OK, here we go.

41:09.800 --> 41:13.640
This message is for Roger, and it's from Roger.

41:13.640 --> 41:18.760
Roger, this is another option for like places to put this energy.

41:18.760 --> 41:21.560
Roger says to Roger, hey Roger, it's you, Roger.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.560
You're a little drunk, which is probably for the best, because this will be more fun if

41:25.560 --> 41:26.680
you don't remember it.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.760
I just wanted to say, hang in there, buddy.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.000
You're doing your best, and you've come very far.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.080
Keep on trucking, Deuterino.

41:33.080 --> 41:36.760
Also, everyone needs to know how amazing your dog Pistachio is.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.240
Team Stachy, remember to floss.

41:39.240 --> 41:40.280
Love, drunk you.

41:40.280 --> 41:45.560
I love this for a lot of reasons, but also anyone who listens to Can I Pet Your Dog will

41:45.560 --> 41:48.760
know that Allegra's dog is also named Pistachio.

41:48.760 --> 41:53.320
I love that there are two Pistachios in the world, and I assume maybe it's the same dog.

41:53.320 --> 41:53.560
Yeah.

41:53.560 --> 41:56.600
And it's got some kind of shared ownership thing that I was not aware of.

41:57.160 --> 42:05.160
I love that this is just like really inconsequential memento, like really low stakes memento.

42:05.160 --> 42:05.800
Right.

42:05.800 --> 42:10.680
You've got to remember, your dog fucking rules, go Patriots.

42:10.680 --> 42:17.480
There had to be more than a few Rodgers when this message started who were like, wait a

42:17.480 --> 42:18.200
minute, did I?

42:18.200 --> 42:18.760
Uh-oh.

42:18.760 --> 42:23.400
Uh-oh, uh-oh, did I, hope there's nothing to be, oh, Pistachio, okay, it's not me.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.680
My dog's name is Pecan.

42:24.680 --> 42:25.320
Fucking great.

42:26.120 --> 42:26.600
Cool.

42:27.560 --> 42:33.560
I've got a message here from Daniel Ford to Christine Ford, dearest wife of nine years,

42:33.560 --> 42:38.600
dearest wife of nine years, I was kindly asked to edit the first version of my anniversary

42:38.600 --> 42:41.320
message to you before it was read by the Macroys.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.840
It's probably for the best.

42:42.840 --> 42:46.840
Happy anniversary, hint, it mentioned Hercule Poirot.

42:48.040 --> 42:51.720
I don't remember, I don't remember turning that one down, but the only thing I think

42:51.720 --> 42:55.160
is that we knew we'd have a hard time saying the name Hercule Poirot.

42:57.160 --> 43:02.040
And if I know one thing is that Justin hates Hercule Poirot with a passion, so we probably

43:02.040 --> 43:07.320
had to cut it out just so Justin didn't get, you know, didn't boil with a white hot anger.

43:07.320 --> 43:11.480
Actually, the weird thing about that is that I mentioned, I referenced Hercule Poirot

43:12.120 --> 43:13.800
in the last episode.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.000
That's very strange, right?

43:15.000 --> 43:18.280
Maybe that's why we had to edit it, because we only got one free mention.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.080
The only thing I can think-

43:19.080 --> 43:22.360
We did it twice, the Agatha Christie estate would charge us for it.

43:22.360 --> 43:27.240
The only thing I can think is that that first message was like, dear Macroys, please read

43:27.240 --> 43:29.160
this in your Hercule Poirot voice.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.400
Oh, look at my weird balls.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.480
Ah, we can't, you can't make us say that.

43:34.280 --> 43:37.160
You can't fucking make, I'm not some sort of circus elephant.

43:38.360 --> 43:42.680
Are you troubled by lack of astute yet dick joke filled analysis of bad movies?

43:42.680 --> 43:46.520
Do you experience feelings of laughter and enjoyment when you hear three friends go off

43:46.520 --> 43:47.880
on stupid tangents?

43:47.880 --> 43:53.000
Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter, ghost, or totally rad party

43:53.000 --> 43:56.440
dude house cat who really only exists as a sound effect?

43:56.440 --> 44:00.600

44:30.520 --> 44:31.800
Yeah, that'd be great actually.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.520
This one's sent in by game recognized game Rachel Rosen.

44:34.520 --> 44:35.000
Thank you, Rachel.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.040
It's by yahoo answers user Lord Minecraft.

44:39.400 --> 44:39.880
All right.

44:40.760 --> 44:41.320
Who asks?

44:41.320 --> 44:41.960
Sure it is.

44:42.840 --> 44:44.840
God, Notch has a lot of free time now, huh?

44:44.840 --> 44:52.440
Uh, if a person owns a piece of land, do they own it to the center of the earth?

44:53.960 --> 44:54.440
Wow.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.480
Well, can you really own land?

44:58.120 --> 44:59.560
That's a good point.

44:59.560 --> 45:00.680
Yes, I do.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.640
Oh, okay.

45:01.640 --> 45:01.880
Cool.

45:03.240 --> 45:03.800
That's a great.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.120
That's a great question, Travis.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.080
Yes, absolutely.

45:07.080 --> 45:07.640
You can.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.000
And Justin and I do.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.920
Oh, I should do that.

45:10.920 --> 45:12.040
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

45:12.040 --> 45:18.440
Um, yeah, you know, I got a, I got a plot and, uh, the question is if it goes down,

45:18.440 --> 45:23.640
like, do I own the earth gets smaller as you get down closer to the center of it.

45:23.640 --> 45:24.040
Right.

45:24.040 --> 45:28.040
Like if you own like a little cone of it, like the surface area is the biggest area

45:28.040 --> 45:29.160
than the inner core.

45:29.160 --> 45:32.440
But do I own like, I don't know what it would be by the time you get down there,

45:32.440 --> 45:37.560
like maybe a half foot of the inner core of the fucking planet of that white, white,

45:37.560 --> 45:41.000
white, hot phosphorus magnet magma or whatever the fuck's down there.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.520
Do I own that shit?

45:42.520 --> 45:43.080
Is it mine?

45:44.200 --> 45:49.000
Because if not, someone could buy the earth under your house.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.680
And make a little mole house under there and have fucking parties all the time.

45:52.680 --> 45:55.240
And it's like, oh, I hate my mole neighbors.

45:56.680 --> 46:01.080
Oh, I know what, here's the thing.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.000
What about, what about the air above?

46:03.000 --> 46:08.200
Do you own a tube that extends from the center of the earth to the end of the universe?

46:08.200 --> 46:09.720
Jesus, that's like infinite.

46:09.720 --> 46:10.840
How big is your plot?

46:10.840 --> 46:13.320
Um, infinity expanding square feet.

46:13.320 --> 46:14.200
It's pretty great.

46:14.840 --> 46:15.640
It's pretty cool.

46:16.360 --> 46:16.680
I love it.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.880
Every time a plane flies over my house, I own it for two seconds.

46:19.880 --> 46:22.760
I own it and everyone and all the things on board.

46:22.760 --> 46:23.400
It rules.

46:24.920 --> 46:25.960
You're mine, Cloud.

46:25.960 --> 46:27.640
Cloud, you belong to me, son.

46:27.640 --> 46:31.800
You belong to me from 1111 to 1111 and 30 seconds.

46:31.800 --> 46:32.280
That's right.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.200
Big flaming idiot.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.240
You're mine.

46:35.240 --> 46:35.800
You're mine.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.480
Give me a, give me a tan, stupid.

46:37.480 --> 46:41.160
Set my DVR to record Ray Donovan.

46:41.160 --> 46:42.120
The sun, son.

46:42.840 --> 46:49.240
Son, do you, do you, uh, uh, uh, you own the, the, so you own the part of the earth

46:50.440 --> 46:52.440
that is at the inverse of that, right?

46:52.440 --> 46:52.920
Yeah, bro.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.920
Crust mantle, the whole shit.

46:54.920 --> 46:57.960
I know, but like on the other side too, right?

46:57.960 --> 47:03.400
If you imagine as a, as a, as a, like a, uh, uh, uh, not conical.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.120
Yeah, no, a cylindrical.

47:06.120 --> 47:11.160
Okay, tubular, a cylindrical tubular like portion of the earth.

47:11.800 --> 47:17.240
I mean, this stands to reason because you own like the, the very surface, you own the

47:17.240 --> 47:20.520
grass, you own the dirt, you own what's below the dirt.

47:20.520 --> 47:27.000
So like keep playing it down and you actually own a square of land on the other side of

47:27.000 --> 47:27.720
the earth.

47:27.720 --> 47:27.880
Yeah.

47:27.880 --> 47:32.040
Well, actually Justin, what most people don't know is when you buy land, you're actually

47:32.040 --> 47:36.600
entering into a partnership with a person on the opposite side of the earth that owns

47:36.600 --> 47:37.240
that land.

47:37.800 --> 47:41.480
It's like, can you, can you cut your Bush's person living in Taiwan, please?

47:42.280 --> 47:46.440
You are making my tubular space of earth look bad.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.600
And someday I will come visit that other end of my tooth.

47:50.600 --> 47:51.480
Ah, beans guys.

47:51.480 --> 47:57.320
I just checked the map and, uh, fuck my shit's just like in the middle of the Indian ocean.

47:57.320 --> 47:59.080
I don't have anything over there.

47:59.080 --> 47:59.720
The Merman.

47:59.720 --> 48:02.840
And I guess I got some, a little bit of the Indian ocean.

48:02.840 --> 48:06.280
So I got whatever fish or whales or just live down there.

48:06.280 --> 48:07.320
Man, that sucks.

48:07.320 --> 48:10.920
I was hoping to at least get a little bit Australia or maybe the Southern tip of Africa

48:10.920 --> 48:12.760
or Madagascar or something fun.

48:12.760 --> 48:15.000
Everybody wants Madagascar Griffin.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.480
You know, I'm looking at the movie came out pretty much all of America is just all Indian

48:19.480 --> 48:20.280
ocean over there.

48:20.280 --> 48:23.000
So fuck that's a, that's a raw deal.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.320
It's not great.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.520
Um, do you guys want to Yahoo?

48:28.520 --> 48:29.800
Oh, we're on one already, huh?

48:32.200 --> 48:33.880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:33.880 --> 48:38.600
The president designated Stonewall as our first national monument to tell the story

48:38.600 --> 48:40.840
of the struggle for LGBT rights.

48:40.840 --> 48:41.480
That's good, right?

48:41.480 --> 48:41.880
Yes.

48:41.880 --> 48:42.520
Good stuff.

48:43.160 --> 48:43.960
That's good.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.960
And who's there to cut the ribbon on that monument?

48:45.960 --> 48:46.920
Leo Shriver.

48:46.920 --> 48:47.560
Leo Shriver.

48:47.560 --> 48:47.800
Wow.

48:48.520 --> 48:51.880
And he's all got, he's dressed up in full Ray Donovan cosplay.

48:51.880 --> 48:53.000
Griffin, that's just a suit.

48:53.560 --> 48:57.000
Well, he's got his toolbox with him.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.560
So he's holding the plunger.

48:59.560 --> 49:06.440
So I think he's carrying a broken toilet on his back, which is mostly symbolic because

49:06.440 --> 49:10.280
he doesn't really have a toilet on his back in the show, but like it always weighs them

49:10.280 --> 49:10.520
down.

49:10.520 --> 49:11.480
You know what I mean?

49:11.480 --> 49:16.440
It's like Halloween, like you're not going to recognize him unless he has it on there.

49:16.440 --> 49:17.720
Here's another question.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.800
I just love Ray Donovan so much.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.240
That's the only thing about it is how much I love Ray Donovan in the show.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.160
This is a good one.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.800
This will be fruitful discussion.

49:27.800 --> 49:31.560
My girlfriend finds it strange that I prefer to drink directly from the tap rather than

49:31.560 --> 49:33.720
take out a glass to get a drink of water.

49:33.720 --> 49:37.560
I tell her that sometimes I just want a couple of sips of water and it's easier to drink

49:37.560 --> 49:41.400
right from the tap when I want rather than taking out a glass and dirtying it with my

49:41.400 --> 49:42.040
mouth.

49:42.040 --> 49:46.120
She argues that I can leave the glass out with the water I don't drink for later, but

49:46.120 --> 49:49.000
I prefer not to have a dusty room temperature water later on.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.200
Am I the weird one for this?

49:50.840 --> 49:51.800
Thank you.

49:51.800 --> 49:54.120
That's thirsty for advice in New York City.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.520
Okay, there's two different questions.

49:56.520 --> 49:59.480
Question one, are you weird for drinking straight from the tap?

49:59.480 --> 50:04.840
Question two, are you weird for not wanting a left out glass of water for later?

50:04.840 --> 50:07.400
Answer to question two, you are not weird.

50:07.400 --> 50:11.080
The glass sits out, whatever germs and dust are in the air, get on it.

50:11.080 --> 50:15.720
And I don't care what science tells me or someone says that that's not true, I know

50:15.720 --> 50:19.960
that there are germs floating around everywhere landing on my water and I don't want to drink

50:19.960 --> 50:20.440
it later.

50:20.440 --> 50:25.000
If I drink water that's been sitting around for like a day, I know.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.840
Like, let's not pretend like, you can call science bullshit on that.

50:28.840 --> 50:30.760
I know, I can always tell.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.600
That's gross, stale water, no thanks.

50:33.400 --> 50:38.920
I would say that you're giving into a primal instinct to drink water from the tap.

50:38.920 --> 50:44.440
You want to drink running water because there's a higher likelihood that it will not be full

50:44.440 --> 50:47.080
of garbage.

50:47.080 --> 50:52.920
So you wanting to drink running water is actually your evolutionary instincts trying to preserve

50:52.920 --> 50:53.080
you.

50:53.720 --> 50:56.920
You know, Bear Grylls says don't drink stagnant water.

50:56.920 --> 51:01.400
You got to drink water that flows because stagnant water will be full of germs and bacteria

51:01.400 --> 51:01.880
and shit.

51:02.600 --> 51:03.800
And so drink it.

51:03.800 --> 51:07.000
Have you ever seen a deer drinking out of an old glass of water?

51:07.000 --> 51:08.680
No, because the deer knows better.

51:09.240 --> 51:13.960
You know what I do, if I drink, if I get a glass of water out, I'll get it out, drink

51:13.960 --> 51:14.920
the water I want.

51:14.920 --> 51:18.120
Sometimes I have half full, sometimes three quarters full.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.240
It's my water.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.240
And then I'll drink as much as I want.

51:21.240 --> 51:23.240
I try to drink a lot, you know, water is so important.

51:23.240 --> 51:27.640
And then I'll dump out what I don't drink and I'll put the glass back in the cabinet.

51:27.640 --> 51:28.440
It's just water, right?

51:29.160 --> 51:29.880
Well, what?

51:29.880 --> 51:30.520
It's just water.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.120
Well, here's the thing, right?

51:32.120 --> 51:32.680
What's on that?

51:32.680 --> 51:33.800
What is different?

51:33.800 --> 51:35.160
What has changed chemically about that?

51:35.160 --> 51:36.360
I mean, your mouth touched it.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.880
Yeah, your fucking lip touched it.

51:37.880 --> 51:38.760
Okay, my mouth touched it.

51:38.760 --> 51:40.200
My wife smooches me.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.280
So she's obviously not freaked out about that.

51:42.280 --> 51:43.640
And the other part is just water.

51:43.640 --> 51:45.480
What's the harm?

51:45.480 --> 51:46.680
That's fucking ironclad, bro.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.320
Yeah, there's no there's no.

51:49.320 --> 51:50.120
Yeah, it's rock solid.

51:50.120 --> 51:50.760
There's nothing.

51:50.760 --> 51:51.720
There's no reason.

51:51.720 --> 51:52.360
Sure.

51:52.360 --> 51:53.480
I can't help but no reason.

51:53.480 --> 51:57.720
I can't help but feel that you're maybe in your own very small way.

51:57.720 --> 52:03.160
Just moving the needle a little bit closer to purge the purge side of things with this.

52:03.960 --> 52:05.400
This is not my intent.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.200
This is not my intent.

52:06.200 --> 52:12.120
And I should mention if it helps to counterbalance, I always am drinking from my Ray Donovan collectible

52:12.120 --> 52:13.880
cup set that I got at Burger King.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.560
So if that helps.

52:15.560 --> 52:16.840
Those are self-sterilizing.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.640
What if people come to your home?

52:19.640 --> 52:24.040
Do you point out the ones that you've gunked up with your trash?

52:24.040 --> 52:24.440
Good question.

52:25.080 --> 52:28.280
Because I'm going to be in your house for a while this fall.

52:28.280 --> 52:31.160
And I would like to know, I would like to have some sort of roadmap.

52:31.160 --> 52:34.760
And by the way, this is the second episode in a row where I've requested information

52:34.760 --> 52:40.760
on how to avoid interacting with things that have been inside of your immediate family's mouth

52:40.760 --> 52:42.680
and around your mouth and around the mouth.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.760
Because, oh man, I love you guys to pieces.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.280
But I'd rather not.

52:47.160 --> 52:47.720
Sure, I get that.

52:47.720 --> 52:51.080
Touch that or have that or be, oh God, or be in or around my mouth.

52:53.960 --> 52:57.560
Before we wrap, I would like to take a moment of sincerity here.

52:57.560 --> 53:03.560
Because I know that if you're listening to this, you may be a little bit freaked out,

53:03.560 --> 53:05.480
maybe a little bit down, maybe a little bit whatever.

53:05.480 --> 53:06.840
And we rarely get this earnest on the show.

53:06.840 --> 53:08.280
But I feel like it's important.

53:08.280 --> 53:11.640
And because I'm not getting this message from a lot of people and I wanted to make sure

53:11.640 --> 53:13.720
that if you're listening to this show, then you're getting it from somebody.

53:14.360 --> 53:15.560
Shit's been whack before.

53:16.440 --> 53:17.960
Shit's sucked before.

53:17.960 --> 53:23.640
If you look at the grand span of history, shit sucked a lot, a lot, a lot.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.400
And then there were good days after it.

53:25.400 --> 53:30.520
If you think back in your life to moments that you've had, I bet there are moments that

53:30.520 --> 53:37.400
you've had in your life that have sucked a lot, lot, lot worse than whatever's happening

53:37.400 --> 53:38.520
in the world sucks right now.

53:38.520 --> 53:39.800
You have had sucky days before.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.600
And then after those days, you've had good days.

53:42.600 --> 53:49.560
And I want you to remember that no matter how crappy and scary and shitty and confusing

53:49.560 --> 53:52.040
things might be, things have seen that way before.

53:52.040 --> 53:54.760
They've seen that seen that way before for millennia.

53:54.760 --> 54:01.240
And afterwards, we still manage to create Ray Donovan and a bevy of other points of

54:01.240 --> 54:01.560
light.

54:01.560 --> 54:05.400
I'm with you about these wonderful cycles.

54:05.400 --> 54:08.680
If if Ray Donovan gets canceled, I'll bring the whole thing down.

54:08.680 --> 54:09.640
No, no, no.

54:09.640 --> 54:13.480
Listen, if Ray Donovan gets canceled, all bets are off and you can disregard me as a

54:13.480 --> 54:18.760
madman, but we're in the end times for the moment, for the moment.

54:19.560 --> 54:24.040
And that is all you can be in when you're scared about the world and you're scared

54:24.040 --> 54:25.080
about everything going around you.

54:25.080 --> 54:30.760
Look at the moment that you're in right now, right this second, and remind yourself that

54:30.760 --> 54:32.120
that is all you have.

54:32.120 --> 54:34.280
And right now, maybe it's OK.

54:34.280 --> 54:36.120
Maybe it's not.

54:36.120 --> 54:36.600
I don't know.

54:36.600 --> 54:41.320
Maybe you're getting like, I don't know, like slow steamrolled over like an Austin

54:41.320 --> 54:43.240
Powers movie or something, but probably not.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.200
Probably things are all right.

54:44.760 --> 54:49.400
And you will get through this the same as you've gotten through things before and the

54:49.400 --> 54:52.120
same as we as a people have gotten through things before.

54:52.760 --> 54:53.560
Shit sucks.

54:53.560 --> 54:54.680
It won't suck forever.

54:54.680 --> 54:57.720
Even if this moment sucks, there's another moment on the way.

54:57.720 --> 54:58.120
Yeah.

54:58.120 --> 54:58.520
Yep.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.280
Now, just things you can do.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.040
Just get off Twitter.

55:02.040 --> 55:07.240
If you can't get off Twitter, don't get on Twitter and then talk about how the world

55:07.240 --> 55:10.200
is ending because that's not helping anything or anybody.

55:10.200 --> 55:13.160
And there's plenty of people already doing that.

55:13.160 --> 55:17.960
So you don't need that covered when things are bad and things aren't great.

55:18.840 --> 55:24.520
Being on Twitter will do absolutely no good for anybody because it's kind of a I'm not

55:24.520 --> 55:29.000
saying don't inform yourself or whatever, but like it's just an echo chamber of people

55:29.000 --> 55:31.320
all talking about how the apocalypse is coming.

55:31.320 --> 55:36.360
And that's not that's literally it's psychically damaging and it is negative helpful.

55:36.920 --> 55:39.160
So like figure out a way to be proactive.

55:39.160 --> 55:39.960
But it don't.

55:39.960 --> 55:46.120
Twitter's not that way because Twitter's the fucking Twitter's just where things don't

55:46.120 --> 55:47.560
put any stock in anything you read there.

55:48.200 --> 55:52.440
The fact that somebody says on Twitter that the everything shit in the world's falling

55:52.440 --> 55:55.240
apart probably is not true because it's on fucking Twitter.

55:55.240 --> 55:55.880
That's a good point.

55:55.880 --> 55:59.880
You disregard everything else on Twitter 24 hours a day.

55:59.880 --> 56:03.640
Please do not give credence to the things that scare you or the things that piss you

56:03.640 --> 56:03.800
off.

56:03.800 --> 56:04.840
It's Twitter.

56:04.840 --> 56:07.000
Fucking delete the app and move on with your life.

56:07.000 --> 56:11.240
But keep following us because we do have a lot of great content coming your way.

56:11.240 --> 56:12.120
Watch the tags.

56:12.120 --> 56:13.080
Watch the tags.

56:13.080 --> 56:13.800
Mind the tags.

56:13.800 --> 56:16.120
A lot of Ray Donovan based stuff.

56:16.120 --> 56:18.040
A lot of fan fiction we've been writing.

56:19.480 --> 56:23.400
Anyway, is Ray Donovan potentially like a highly super problematic show?

56:23.400 --> 56:25.000
And just like, oh, man, I hope not.

56:25.000 --> 56:31.720
Hey, listen, if it was that problematic, it wouldn't have made it three seasons.

56:31.720 --> 56:32.680
That's all I'm saying.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.080
Right.

56:33.080 --> 56:34.360
It's got to be doing something.

56:34.360 --> 56:34.680
Right.

56:34.680 --> 56:37.000
So I'm reading a headline here.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.040
Why is this horrible show going to its fourth season?

56:40.840 --> 56:41.880
Everybody hates it.

56:41.880 --> 56:42.520
Oh, no.

56:42.520 --> 56:43.000
Oh, God.

56:43.000 --> 56:43.720
What have we done?

56:45.240 --> 56:48.760
Ray Donovan sets back the Equal Rights Movement 30 years.

56:48.760 --> 56:49.640
Damn it, Ray Donovan.

56:49.640 --> 56:50.440
How are you?

56:50.440 --> 56:51.960
I mean, it's a powerful show.

56:51.960 --> 56:52.520
No doubt.

56:53.080 --> 56:53.640
No doubt.

56:53.640 --> 56:54.280
No doubt.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.800
The ability to change hearts and minds.

56:55.800 --> 56:57.640
Anyway, that's going to do it for us.

56:57.640 --> 56:58.600
Chin up, motherfuckers.

57:00.520 --> 57:01.800
My name's Justin McElroy.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.080
Oh, we're not going to do the rest of this stuff.

57:03.080 --> 57:03.880
Thanks to John Roderick.

57:03.880 --> 57:05.320
We're not going to do like the wrap ups.

57:05.320 --> 57:08.760
I'm just mentioning that my name's Justin McElroy and I want you to chin up, motherfuckers.

57:08.760 --> 57:11.240
I have been worried about your branding, Justin.

57:11.240 --> 57:12.200
Yeah, it's back.

57:12.200 --> 57:13.400
The brand is back.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.640
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the server theme song.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.960
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:19.960 --> 57:22.680
It's an amazing song and we love it so much.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.240
And thank you, John Roderick and the Long Winters.

57:25.800 --> 57:28.440
We want to say thank you to MaximumFun.org for hosting the show.

57:28.440 --> 57:30.920
Go check out all the other amazing shows on there.

57:31.640 --> 57:35.800
We got a bunch of new ones and lots of good ones that have been around for a while that

57:35.800 --> 57:38.200
maybe you've been waiting for your opportunity to check out.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.080
This is it.

57:39.080 --> 57:39.800
Go check it out.

57:41.880 --> 57:42.920
Treat yourself this week.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.120
Find some way to do something nice for yourself.

57:46.120 --> 57:48.360
Go get a cheap massage or something.

57:48.360 --> 57:49.320
And you know what?

57:49.320 --> 57:50.920
Do something nice for someone else.

57:50.920 --> 57:51.160
Yeah.

57:51.160 --> 57:53.160
And it's not a distraction, it's not an avoidance.

57:53.160 --> 57:54.280
You only have the moment.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.240
Make your moments good.

57:55.240 --> 57:58.920
You can't, you probably can't get, you probably can't

57:59.960 --> 58:04.040
calk up whatever cracks have formed or whatever.

58:04.040 --> 58:08.520
Like you can do your part, but just like don't, you know, don't obsess over it.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.920
Just go out there and get rubbed on for an hour or so.

58:10.920 --> 58:11.880
And you know what?

58:11.880 --> 58:15.080
If you find yourself like drawn and you want to put something on Twitter,

58:15.960 --> 58:19.800
maybe rather than putting more negativity out there in the world, pick somebody that you like,

58:19.800 --> 58:22.440
somebody you're a fan of or someone you're a friend of and say like,

58:22.440 --> 58:23.880
hey, I think you're great.

58:23.880 --> 58:24.200
Yeah.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.240
Something as simple as that.

58:25.240 --> 58:28.040
Let's put a little bit more positivity out there in the world

58:28.040 --> 58:29.880
because that's what we need more of really.

58:29.880 --> 58:32.840
And in my opinion, positivity breeds positivity.

58:32.840 --> 58:35.960
And you go out there and you say something nice to someone and you make their day.

58:35.960 --> 58:39.000
And maybe that's all the power you have is to make one person's day.

58:39.000 --> 58:39.240
Like.

58:39.240 --> 58:41.720
But that's better than ruining 10 people's day.

58:41.720 --> 58:45.480
Like Ray Donovan says, this HVAC unit isn't going to repair itself.

58:46.120 --> 58:46.760
Exactly.

58:46.760 --> 58:50.840
Uh, uh, let's, uh, have a, uh, final.

58:50.840 --> 58:52.360
Oh, Max Funconese.

58:52.360 --> 58:52.840
Super quick.

58:52.840 --> 58:53.240
Oh yeah.

58:53.240 --> 58:53.480
We'll be there.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.560
It's in September, the weekend before Labor Day.

58:55.560 --> 58:58.280
Go to maxfuncon.com, I believe.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.680
And you can, uh, get tickets to that.

59:00.680 --> 59:01.400
It's going to be really fun.

59:01.400 --> 59:03.000
And we hope that we, uh, can see you there.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.840
Oh, and our Boston shows are coming up.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.760
Start sending in your questions for that now.

59:06.760 --> 59:08.840
Put a Boston live show in the subject.

59:08.840 --> 59:09.160
Please.

59:09.160 --> 59:10.680
So we can have those ready for you.

59:11.240 --> 59:13.080
One definitely super last thing.

59:13.080 --> 59:16.280
I mean, at this time, uh, I opened up a PO box here in Austin.

59:16.280 --> 59:19.400
Justin and Travis have one and I want to have one.

59:19.400 --> 59:25.640
Uh, uh, so if you want to send, send us stuff, me or Rachel stuff for maybe a Rose Buddies fan.

59:25.640 --> 59:28.120
Uh, that's our bachelor, bachelorette podcast.

59:28.120 --> 59:29.640
You can send stuff to Austin.

59:29.640 --> 59:35.960
Uh, just send it to PO box 66639 Austin, Texas 78766.

59:35.960 --> 59:42.280
Again, that's PO box 66639 Austin, Texas 78766.

59:42.280 --> 59:47.080
Uh, we'll get that put up on macro shows.com so you guys can find it easy.

59:47.080 --> 59:47.560
You know what?

59:47.560 --> 59:50.360
Just to like blow through, just to take cheer base day up a little bit.

59:50.360 --> 59:51.800
I know we're running long, but whatever.

59:51.800 --> 59:52.760
Uh, we got some mail.

59:52.760 --> 59:55.480
I'm just going to blast through real quick to tell you guys that there's good stuff

59:55.480 --> 59:55.800
happening.

59:55.800 --> 59:56.840
Good people out there.

59:56.840 --> 59:59.320
Uh, Chris is a member of the little Debbie family.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:04.680
The family that runs little Debbie and send us a box, like a giant ass box of little Debbie

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.920
snack treats because we talked about them on the adventure zone.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.080
Okay.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.920
Cool cool stuff.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.560
Cool cool stuff.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.480
So when you said us, you meant you, cause I'm never, I'm not going to taste those little

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:13.720
Debbie.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.880
So actually what you just did is you purged me a bit and you took some joy out of my life

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.520
knowing that a little bit.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:24.360
Alexandra and William are getting married, uh, and, uh, later this year and they told

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.160
us to save the date.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:32.040
Uh, had a, uh, Amy Kittle graduated from, uh, high school at East Hamilton.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.160
We're super proud of her.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:37.640
She wanted us to know Alex and Aaron are getting married later this year in Washington DC.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:37.960
Hell yeah.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.560
That's going to be fucking great.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:46.040
Uh, Timothy and Mariah sent us, uh, a postcard with a beautiful picture of horses on it.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.760
Uh, we got Maria and Nick sent us a postcard that congratulates on 300 episodes.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.160
It's got a really cool raccoon on it.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:53.640
Hell yeah.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.160
Just grand.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:55.480
Love it.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.720
Travis sent me some tax, uh, some receipts.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.040
That's not useful, but you know, stuff's happening out there.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.720
People, it's good stuff.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.360
People have also sent me stuff, but I didn't know we were going to do this.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.040
So I don't like have a here.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.160

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:09.400
Yeah.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.840
Um, you don't want to send me stuff too, but that's the reality.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.920
Enjoy your day.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.960
Enjoy your moments.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.480
Enjoy each other very much.

Yeah.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.920
And, uh, there's lots of great, um, my brother, my brother McGeer at topotico.com.

horrifying, hilarious ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:16.200
