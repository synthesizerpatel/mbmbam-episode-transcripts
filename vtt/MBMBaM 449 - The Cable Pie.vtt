00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.800
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show from the

00:46.800 --> 00:52.560
Modern Era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.560 --> 01:00.080
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:00.080 --> 01:09.280
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't, I can't contain myself anymore hearing that amazing annunciation and

01:09.280 --> 01:13.360
that diction. It's because, you know, you got the lips. There's no tip of the tongue.

01:13.360 --> 01:18.400
There's no Cheetos residue in there blocking the sound waves.

01:18.400 --> 01:25.520
The teeth. It's pick watch 2019. Had the water pick for a little over two weeks or so

01:25.520 --> 01:32.640
sitting in the Amazon box and I looked at it every day and said, not yet, not yet, not yet.

01:32.640 --> 01:39.360
But I had about 10 minutes to kill just before recording and I got in there and I just super

01:39.360 --> 01:45.360
soaked the heck out of it. I had a lot of trepidation the first time I used my water

01:45.360 --> 01:50.400
pick. I was fairly sure that there was, there's definitely a pressure at which you know you're

01:50.400 --> 01:56.640
gonna rip it up in there and you're just sticking this tube in your mouth and going for it.

01:56.640 --> 02:02.160
Yeah, I'm just worried that if I ever used one I would accidentally set it to sand blaster.

02:02.160 --> 02:02.800
Yeah.

02:02.800 --> 02:08.000
And it would just tear both the enamel and then everything underneath the enamel,

02:09.120 --> 02:10.480
just straight out of my mouth.

02:10.480 --> 02:17.280
But I gotta say refreshing other than the horrible pain of pressure washing my inside skin.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.880
Uh-huh.

02:18.880 --> 02:24.400
I gotta say the results, folks, I saw a little bit of tastation come out of there.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.200
Yeah, and those haven't even been around since like 1999.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.440
Do you think if we mentioned tastation's enough,

02:31.440 --> 02:34.160
eventually the company will just give us the IP?

02:34.160 --> 02:37.120
I don't think it exists. Wait, who owned it? Is that Nestle?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.240
That's Hershey's if memory serves.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.040
Hershey's.

02:39.040 --> 02:45.200
Yes. But anyway, I used the water pick today and my congressional medal of honor has yet

02:45.200 --> 02:46.960
to appear and I'm confused about that.

02:46.960 --> 02:47.840
That's strange.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.360
Or at least a big boy sticker.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.600
Griffin, I do need to know when you said the pain in your mouth,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.280
the blasting your inside skin.

02:55.280 --> 02:55.920
Blasting it.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.200
Can you compare that? I've never used a water pick.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.840
Could you compare that level of pain to something for me?

03:03.280 --> 03:06.800
Have you ever used one of those massage chairs at the airport

03:06.800 --> 03:08.880
that have like the balls in it that go in?

03:08.880 --> 03:11.840
Imagine just putting your teeth right into one of those somehow,

03:11.840 --> 03:13.920
like sort of sitting on it teeth first

03:13.920 --> 03:17.280
and just sort of get over the hygiene issues associated with that.

03:17.280 --> 03:22.400
But, you know, physically that's sort of the feel that we're talking about.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.440
I don't care for that.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.360
And then the water, there's a sort of, you know, manners issue

03:29.360 --> 03:31.840
of what you do with the water as it's being blasted in.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.120
You don't want anybody to see the unsightly side of you,

03:35.120 --> 03:37.920
you know, getting on in there and just dribbling water out of your mouth

03:38.880 --> 03:41.120
like some sort of sea monster.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.200
So do you swallow it all?

03:43.200 --> 03:45.120
The answer is yes and it's bad.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.960
Now, I just assumed that as you did it,

03:48.960 --> 03:51.040
you would kind of keep your mouth open

03:51.040 --> 03:53.520
and it would just be like pouring from you

03:53.520 --> 03:56.960
like a character in a sci-fi show that was drowning on dry land.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.440
Sure, like a human water feature situation.

03:59.440 --> 03:59.920
Yeah.

03:59.920 --> 04:00.640
Yeah, but folks-

04:00.640 --> 04:03.680
You close your mouth tight around it, it'll blast out your nose

04:03.680 --> 04:05.680
and then it'll do a number on the sizes.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.960
But I have so much air moving between my-

04:09.600 --> 04:12.480
The gaps between my teeth are so big

04:12.480 --> 04:13.600
and I'd never appreciated it.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.520
The space between.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.320
Yeah, there's a little-

04:16.320 --> 04:19.120
The gap between.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.240
Let him keep going.

04:20.240 --> 04:20.720
I want to.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.600
That's all the words I know.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.040
That's all the words he knows

04:23.040 --> 04:25.120
because it's the only words in the song.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.880
I used my water pick today.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.480
Let's not lose the point of this.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.360
We can make jokes, but I used my water pick today.

04:36.000 --> 04:36.640
Where is that?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.800
We need a combo t-shirt,

04:38.800 --> 04:43.520
I used my water pick today and hey, I might go eat some charcuterie later.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.080
What's up?

04:44.080 --> 04:45.280
Just a two.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.080
And then once the charcuterie is trapped in my teeth,

04:48.080 --> 04:52.640
I'll use the water pick again in a never ending cycle until one day I die.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.040
My favorite part is that the sort of relationship I've built

04:57.040 --> 04:59.200
and how it's evolved with my dentist,

04:59.200 --> 05:01.280
who at my first cleaning was like,

05:01.280 --> 05:05.040
oh my God, because it had been a while since my last confession.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.320
And then every sort of six months or so, he would be like,

05:08.320 --> 05:09.520
wow, you really need to floss.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.160
And he'd be like, you should really be flossing

05:12.160 --> 05:14.160
or at the very least go get a water pick.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.480
And then like on my last appointment, he was like,

05:16.480 --> 05:18.480
I know you're not going to floss.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.480
I give up, go buy a water pick.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.240
And then I used it two weeks later.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.400
Are you sort of hesitant to use the teeth again?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.080
You kind of hate to because it's like...

05:28.080 --> 05:30.080
I'll be honest, yeah, a little bit.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.520
And I'm trying, yeah.

05:31.520 --> 05:35.040
So I'm trying to figure out if there's other holes I can get the food in.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.680
If there's other sort of stuff I can do.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.000
Yes, and other places to put the food.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.360
There's gotta be other places I can get the food in.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.400
And I know the first thing you're gonna laugh and joke about

05:46.400 --> 05:49.200
for this scuzzy podcast is my ass.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.560
I would never.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.960
I was going to say you could freeze dry it,

05:54.960 --> 05:57.280
crush it up, snort it right up your nose.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.440
That's now we're going somewhere with that.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.120
Yeah, I'm trying to think outside the bun, Griffin.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.120
I'm not just gonna say ass.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.320
Oh, you can put it up your, oh, put the food over your ass.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.320
Just eat like a pickle up your butt.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.320
I would never say that.

06:12.320 --> 06:17.520
But if you wanted to nose-boof some frozen shark udder-y,

06:18.240 --> 06:20.800
then I don't think there's a law against that.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.440
I have an exciting new feature for the podcast

06:29.440 --> 06:31.680
that I'd like to pivot seamlessly into.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.720
Before, because Griffin mentioned Taste Stations.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.720
Half an hour ago.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.720
Half an hour ago.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.720
My mind has been on Taste Stations.

06:40.720 --> 06:44.720
And this feature, I think I'm gonna call it Where Is It Now?

06:44.720 --> 06:48.720
And this is a feature where people on the internet

06:48.720 --> 06:50.720
talk about a thing that they miss very dearly

06:50.720 --> 06:52.720
and we can all share in that with them

06:52.720 --> 06:54.720
and be there and bond with them.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.720
And this is a thread from the Straight Dope.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.720
Are you guys down with this? Are you feeling this right now?

06:58.720 --> 07:00.720
Are you asking us or is this part of the comment?

07:00.720 --> 07:02.720
Yes, I'm asking you.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.720
Okay, yes, let's go.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.720
Are we good? Yes.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.720
Travis, verbal confirmation.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.720
This is from the Straight Dope.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.720
Wolfmeister.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.720
February 27th.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.720
Holy fucking shit.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.720
Today, the day we're recording this,

07:18.720 --> 07:22.720
exactly the day 15 years ago.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.720
2004.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.720
Granted, this is not the most pressing matter of the day,

07:28.720 --> 07:30.720
but I'm sure it's important to some people.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.720
I visited the Hershey's website in 2004,

07:34.720 --> 07:38.720
and they don't even list it as one of their products.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.720
On message boards, it is rumored to have been discontinued.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.720
Of course, the only message board that matters

07:44.720 --> 07:46.720
is the Straight Dope message board.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.720
So, are Hershey's Taste Stations discontinued?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.720
I find it hard to believe these things are popular.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.720
IMHO, these are far better than Werther's,

07:54.720 --> 07:56.720
which are incredibly overrated.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.720
Get them fucked up.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.720
If Taste Stations have been discontinued,

08:02.720 --> 08:04.720
is there anything similar out there?

08:04.720 --> 08:06.720
Werther's.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.720
And you know what I think of Werther's.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.720
They say it right here, you know what I think of Werther's.

08:10.720 --> 08:16.720
And then, a day later, they say,

08:16.720 --> 08:18.720
well, there's no responses, okay?

08:18.720 --> 08:22.720
A day later, well, I see my posting has gone from

08:22.720 --> 08:24.720
relative obscurity to total oblivion.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.720
Some of the dopers here must have a sweet tooth?

08:28.720 --> 08:32.720
Isn't anyone else a fan of these candies?

08:32.720 --> 08:36.720
Free Range Maniac follows up,

08:36.720 --> 08:38.720
I'm sure I've seen them up here.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.720
I work in a large chain drugstore,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.720
so I'll have a look and see if I'm right.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.720
Maybe they just discontinued them in the States?

08:44.720 --> 08:46.720
I know you have candy and chocolate

08:46.720 --> 08:48.720
we never see in Canada.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.720
Paul in Qatar says, what were they?

08:50.720 --> 08:54.720
Wolfmeister, the original Paul,

08:54.720 --> 08:56.720
Taste Stations are, perhaps were,

08:56.720 --> 08:58.720
a great tasting hard candy,

08:58.720 --> 09:00.720
sold in bags of about one pound.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.720
They came in a lot of flavors,

09:02.720 --> 09:06.720
butterscotch, caramel, and so on.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.720
No, stop, that was it.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.720
There's butterscotch, chocolate, and caramel.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.720
So, there's not a so on, there's three total.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.720
To me, and a lot of other people,

09:14.720 --> 09:16.720
they were the greatest tasting candy ever made.

09:16.720 --> 09:20.720
Wait, they weren't, I'm sorry,

09:20.720 --> 09:22.720
there wasn't like a strawberry and cream one?

09:22.720 --> 09:24.720
What am I thinking of?

09:24.720 --> 09:26.720
There was like a hard candy that was like a swirl.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.720
Ooh, yeah, I know what you're talking about,

09:28.720 --> 09:30.720
but I don't know.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.720
Free Range Maniac says, yeah, I checked today,

09:32.720 --> 09:34.720
they're being discontinued.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.720
Maybe they're more popular in Canada?

09:36.720 --> 09:40.720
That was February 28th, 2004.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.720
October 24th, 2012.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.720
Anno Domini, 2012.

09:48.720 --> 09:52.720
Chuckles14901 is coughing.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.720
The dust, what's this old post?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.720
Look, I could just make it out.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.720
Some of the inscriptions here.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.720
It's about taste stations.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.720
I gotta get my two cents on these.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.720
Hold on a second.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.720
Tap, tap, tap.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.720
There are few candies as delicious as the taste stations.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.720
The mint was smooth and refreshing.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.720
The caramel is tasty.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.720
But there's only one candy that ever made chocolate.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.720
Taste stations.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.720
Wow.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.720
No one has made such a delicious candy as the chocolate,

10:24.720 --> 10:28.720
which tastes like dark chocolate or fudge.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.720
It is wondrous.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.720
My heart is breaking.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.720
I would love it if I could find a place that still sells them

10:34.720 --> 10:36.720
for shipment to the States.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.720
I would pay $10 a bag of mint and chocolate taste stations

10:40.720 --> 10:42.720
shipping and handling not included.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.720
Wow.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.720
So you can reach through time and find taste stations.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.720
This can will pay you $10 for a bag,

10:48.720 --> 10:50.720
just not going to cover the shipping and handling.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.720
Justin, this is see a need, fill a need kind of deal.

10:54.720 --> 11:00.720
I'm saying maybe the next McRoy endeavor isn't a podcast,

11:00.720 --> 11:02.720
isn't a TV show, isn't a graphic novel.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.720
Bootleg taste stations.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.720
It's bootleg taste stations.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.720
If we're making 10 bucks a pound on these things,

11:08.720 --> 11:12.720
now this is breaking bad too.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.720
We got that crunchy brown.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.720
We get some people to build some compartments

11:16.720 --> 11:18.720
into their fenders on their old jalopies,

11:18.720 --> 11:20.720
have them drive them down.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.720
Maybe we make them up in Canada

11:22.720 --> 11:24.720
and then they drive them down to the States.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.720
We sell them there and then we fly the money down to,

11:28.720 --> 11:34.720
I don't know, Cuba maybe, and we buy more ingredients there

11:34.720 --> 11:36.720
and the cycle continues.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.720
Taste stations money, baby.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.720
That was a lot of taste stations talk.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.720
Bring it back.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.720
But I think in the meantime, we should do a question.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.720
I love that, Griffin.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.720
You read my mind basically.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.720
I was on a three hour drive this morning when I got hungry.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.720
I spotted a sign on the highway for a hotel chain

11:54.720 --> 11:56.720
that I knew had free breakfast.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.720
I like whatever you're doing here, Justin.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.720
This is a very like noir kind of reading you're doing.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.720
I was on a three hour drive.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.720
I think it's appropriate.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.720
I didn't know that going in, but I feel good about it.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.720
It really works.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.720
Wanting to save a few dollars, I stopped at the hotel

12:12.720 --> 12:14.720
and walked into the lobby pretending I was a guest.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.720
I went straight to the breakfast bar

12:16.720 --> 12:18.720
and helped myself to biscuits.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.720
Oh my God.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.720
And gravy.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.720
I don't know if it was paranoia or if it was legitimate,

12:24.720 --> 12:28.720
but as I was eating, I got the feeling the hotel staff knew

12:28.720 --> 12:30.720
I wasn't supposed to be there.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.720
Unlikely.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.720
I was the only person in the breakfast area.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.720
After seeing three of the hotel staff talk quietly

12:38.720 --> 12:40.720
to each other and look my way,

12:40.720 --> 12:42.720
I gulped down what was left of my orange juice

12:42.720 --> 12:44.720
and made a run for it.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.720
I went out the hotel side of the door

12:46.720 --> 12:48.720
as to avoid walking by the lobby,

12:48.720 --> 12:50.720
and thus the staff turns out the side door

12:50.720 --> 12:52.720
led directly to the outdoor pool.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.720
Keep reading.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.720
There is a fence surrounding the pool

12:56.720 --> 12:58.720
that is too high to jump.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.720
And because I'm not a guest at the hotel,

13:02.720 --> 13:04.720
I don't have a key to get back in

13:04.720 --> 13:06.720
and look for another exit.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.720
I'm stuck. Help.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.720
What do I do?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.720
That's from being caught stealing in Baton Rouge

13:12.720 --> 13:16.720
and you deserve whatever you have received here.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.720
I've got a great suggestion.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.720
Go to jail.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.720
Go to jail.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.720
Go to jail for the crime you did.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.720
Go to... You fucked up this whole thing!

13:28.720 --> 13:32.720
You couldn't at least go to the bathroom for like an hour

13:32.720 --> 13:34.720
and then walk in from the bathroom and go eat.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.720
The reason they know that you're there,

13:36.720 --> 13:38.720
that you're not a guest at the hotel,

13:38.720 --> 13:40.720
is because you walked in from out...

13:40.720 --> 13:42.720
They saw you park your car, come into the hotel,

13:42.720 --> 13:44.720
and eat their pancakes,

13:44.720 --> 13:46.720
and then drink your juice really fast

13:46.720 --> 13:48.720
as you looked around at them nervously

13:48.720 --> 13:50.720
and then sprinted out the side door

13:50.720 --> 13:52.720
to just go take a fever dip.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.720
You fucked up every step of this heist

13:54.720 --> 13:56.720
and you need to go to jail for it

13:56.720 --> 13:58.720
and while you're there you can reflect

13:58.720 --> 14:00.720
on how to do better heists.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.720
You know where they got a lot of free breakfast?

14:02.720 --> 14:04.720
Jail. Jail at it.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.720
All the free meals.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.720
One time when mom and dad were visiting Norman, Oklahoma

14:10.720 --> 14:12.720
where I went to college, Boomer Center,

14:12.720 --> 14:14.720
they were like,

14:14.720 --> 14:16.720
yeah, you and your friends come over.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.720
I think Brent went with me and they said,

14:18.720 --> 14:20.720
and we'll get breakfast.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.720
We went back to the hotel to meet them.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.720
They just took us over to the continental breakfast

14:24.720 --> 14:26.720
there at the hotel.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.720
I'm pretty sure that isn't how it worked.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.720
I did eat it. I was very hungry.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.720
I was in college.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.720
I still feel tricked by dad

14:34.720 --> 14:36.720
and by extension mom

14:36.720 --> 14:38.720
saying, we'll get you breakfast.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.720
By which I mean, Best Western will get you breakfast.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.720
Eat up.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.720
They got it to you. You had it.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.720
That's like saying, hey, do you want to go get lunch?

14:48.720 --> 14:50.720
Cool. Let's break into my neighbor's house

14:50.720 --> 14:52.720
and I'll see if they have any sandwiches.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.720
Not at all like that.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.720
That one's breaking and entering.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.720
The other one is a bending, though not a breaking of policy.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.720
It's a bending and entering.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.720
If you were going to kick in the doors of this hotel,

15:02.720 --> 15:04.720
if you were going to plant a C4 charge

15:04.720 --> 15:06.720
in the front door of this hotel

15:06.720 --> 15:08.720
and smash and grab some pancakes,

15:08.720 --> 15:10.720
I'm not against.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.720
You know me.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.720
If you're trying to save a buck with a little harmless steal,

15:14.720 --> 15:16.720
I'm all for it. I love it.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.720
But you would have been better served

15:18.720 --> 15:20.720
planting a demolition charge in the front door of the hotel,

15:20.720 --> 15:22.720
throwing in a smoke grenade,

15:22.720 --> 15:24.720
running in, grabbing four muffins

15:24.720 --> 15:26.720
and running out.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.720
You did a bad, bad, bad job.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.720
Especially once you introduced that the food you ate

15:30.720 --> 15:32.720
was biscuits and gravy.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.720
If you grabbed an individual container

15:34.720 --> 15:36.720
of Lucky Charms or you grabbed

15:36.720 --> 15:38.720
a frozen Danish

15:38.720 --> 15:40.720
that had been thawed out, that's fine.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.720
Someone made those biscuits and gravy.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.720
Absolutely.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.720
You know what's wild about it, Travis?

15:46.720 --> 15:48.720
Thank you.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.720
There's something about it that's been bothering me,

15:50.720 --> 15:52.720
and it's only now occurred to me.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.720
The fact that you sat down...

15:54.720 --> 15:56.720
You motherfucker!

15:56.720 --> 15:58.720
You didn't just want to steal.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.720
You wanted to sit there and fucking relish it.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.720
I've never been to a continental breakfast

16:02.720 --> 16:04.720
where you could not have swooped

16:04.720 --> 16:06.720
a banana, some yogurt,

16:06.720 --> 16:08.720
a Danish,

16:08.720 --> 16:10.720
some, I don't know,

16:10.720 --> 16:12.720
even a mouthful of bacon.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.720
I mean, whatever.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.720
Whatever it is, you could have been

16:16.720 --> 16:18.720
in and out before they even registered

16:18.720 --> 16:20.720
your presence.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.720
But no, you wanted to sit down and really enjoy

16:22.720 --> 16:24.720
the ambiance

16:24.720 --> 16:26.720
of the Holiday Inn Express.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.720
And as long as we're just doubling down

16:28.720 --> 16:30.720
on being angry at you,

16:30.720 --> 16:32.720
our listener, the last sentence here

16:32.720 --> 16:34.720
about, it turns out the side door...

16:34.720 --> 16:36.720
I'm assuming is now a skeleton

16:36.720 --> 16:38.720
in the backyard of the Holiday Inn.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.720
The side door leads to the outdoor pool.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.720
There's a fence too high to jump,

16:42.720 --> 16:44.720
and I do not have the key to look for another exit.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.720
I feel like I'm playing fucking Zork.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.720
I don't know what else is there.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.720
I can't send in my answer by mail.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.720
Do you have a holocaust cloak?

16:52.720 --> 16:54.720
Do you have a wheelbarrow?

16:54.720 --> 16:56.720
Or a deck chair?

16:56.720 --> 16:58.720
Something that could build an escape plan here.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.720
Let's do a yahoo.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.720
I'm so mad.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.720
I'm not done.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.720
We don't often ask for follow-ups,

17:06.720 --> 17:08.720
but I would like a follow-up,

17:08.720 --> 17:10.720
where we're told beat by beat

17:10.720 --> 17:12.720
how the conversation of you offering to reimburse them

17:12.720 --> 17:14.720
for the biscuits and gravy went.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.720
Like, excuse me, what are you doing out here?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.720
Uh, yes.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.720
I stole your breakfast.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.720
Okay, cool.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.720
You're gonna have to rent a room now

17:24.720 --> 17:26.720
to justify eating our breakfast.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.720
How about I...

17:28.720 --> 17:30.720
Okay, let's play a game.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.720
I don't want...

17:32.720 --> 17:34.720
Let's send jokes out of the room.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.720
This is a skill testing puzzle for you.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.720
You are gonna steal the breakfast.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.720
You're not a guest at the hotel,

17:40.720 --> 17:42.720
but you have to talk to the staff first

17:42.720 --> 17:46.720
before you can steal breakfast.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.720
What is the lie you're gonna make up?

17:48.720 --> 17:50.720
You can't say you're a guest there.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.720
Are you ready? This is what I would do.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.720
I'm going to be checking in later,

17:54.720 --> 17:58.720
but I know that check-in isn't until three o'clock.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.720
Would it be all right if I went ahead

18:00.720 --> 18:02.720
and grabbed something from the breakfast board?

18:02.720 --> 18:04.720
If I smash and grabbed something...

18:04.720 --> 18:06.720
I didn't mean to say smash and grab.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.720
Can I break and enter into your breakfast place

18:08.720 --> 18:10.720
and have the food?

18:10.720 --> 18:12.720
I promise I will get you back later at three

18:12.720 --> 18:14.720
when I definitely stay here.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.720
Here's my ID.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.720
This is a Pokemon card.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.720
Rubble rubble!

18:20.720 --> 18:22.720
My pockets are full of yogurt.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.720
You missed it.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.720
My dad was robbing you fucking blind

18:28.720 --> 18:30.720
of Danish while you were talking to me.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.720
All this trick in the book.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.720
Yeah, it's rough.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.720
How about that Yahoo now?

18:36.720 --> 18:38.720
Yeah, I guess.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.720
Here's one that was sent in by Emma Kant.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.720
Thank you, Emma.

18:42.720 --> 18:46.720
It's Yahoo Answers user Round Square who asks...

18:46.720 --> 18:48.720
Okay, come on.

18:48.720 --> 18:52.720
How do I make other dogs respect my dog?

18:52.720 --> 18:54.720
My dog lacks confidence

18:54.720 --> 18:56.720
and is clearly not an alpha male.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.720
He acts submissive towards other dogs

18:58.720 --> 19:00.720
and tired of defending him all the time.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.720
How do I teach him to defend himself

19:02.720 --> 19:04.720
so he won't be bullied anymore?

19:04.720 --> 19:06.720
Oh, okay.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.720
The question I'm asking probably means

19:08.720 --> 19:10.720
physically defending him,

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
not like when your dog walks away saying,

19:12.720 --> 19:14.720
hey guys, he's doing his best.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.720
Hey, can we all just be cool with Ralph?

19:16.720 --> 19:18.720
How do I make other dogs respect my dog

19:18.720 --> 19:22.720
who I have to defend with my human abilities?

19:22.720 --> 19:24.720
The obvious answer is

19:24.720 --> 19:26.720
you're gonna dress up like a dog

19:26.720 --> 19:28.720
and then when your dog comes around,

19:28.720 --> 19:30.720
you're all scared of that dog

19:30.720 --> 19:32.720
and be like, oh, I wouldn't mess with that dog.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.720
Like, you guys see this guy over here?

19:34.720 --> 19:36.720
Oh, he's rough.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.720
And then the other dogs will be like,

19:38.720 --> 19:40.720
are you the actual Scooby-Doo?

19:40.720 --> 19:42.720
And you're like, um, yes.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.720
And then you let your dog kick your own ass.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.720
He's my cousin.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.720
Scooby-Doo's my cousin

19:48.720 --> 19:50.720
and I got a dad that works at Nintendo.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.720
That dog just beat up Scooby-Doo's cousin

19:52.720 --> 19:54.720
and Jim Tendo's son.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.720
This new dog is cool as hell, guys.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.720
His cousin is Scooby-Doo

19:58.720 --> 20:00.720
and his dad works at Nintendo?

20:00.720 --> 20:02.720
Why is that other dog picking on him?

20:02.720 --> 20:04.720
Hey, jerk, leave Scooby-Doo's cousin alone.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.720
Back off of our new best friend,

20:06.720 --> 20:08.720
Scooby-Doo's cousin. We respect him.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.720
Oh, I was just about to show you guys

20:10.720 --> 20:12.720
my four skateboards,

20:12.720 --> 20:14.720
but it looks like I can get my ass kicked

20:14.720 --> 20:16.720
by this big cool dog.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.720
So that's backfired.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.720
Oh, my plan.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.720
Oh, that's the one.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.720
No, that's working as intended

20:24.720 --> 20:26.720
because the cool dog is your dog.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.720
How did you guys lose the plot that fast?

20:28.720 --> 20:30.720
No, but I'm just saying everybody loves Scooby-Doo's cousin.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.720
They don't want to see him beat up.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.720
That is the fiction that develops

20:34.720 --> 20:36.720
and everybody likes the new giant dog,

20:36.720 --> 20:38.720
the new man-sized dog so much.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.720
Well, then you show up the next day

20:40.720 --> 20:42.720
and you're horribly injured

20:42.720 --> 20:44.720
and cool dog, your dog,

20:44.720 --> 20:46.720
has taken care of you

20:46.720 --> 20:48.720
and is nursing you back to health.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.720
You know what? I like that cool dog.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.720
He brings Scooby-Doo's Nintendo cousin around.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.720
We hunked out our differences.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.720
Yeah, we figured it out together.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.720
Maybe we go the other way then

20:58.720 --> 21:00.720
and opposite of my plan

21:00.720 --> 21:02.720
and you dress your dog up like a human

21:02.720 --> 21:04.720
and then teach him to walk on two legs

21:04.720 --> 21:06.720
and then you bring him around.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.720
All dogs, I think, instantly have

21:08.720 --> 21:10.720
some form of respect for a human.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.720
I think that's a good part.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.720
And then you get him a fake ID

21:14.720 --> 21:16.720
that's old enough to buy beer

21:16.720 --> 21:18.720
and then the other dogs are going to be so fucking stoked.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.720
Yeah.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.720
I don't know of a dog old enough to buy beer.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.720
I don't think there's ever been a 21-year-old dog.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.720
That's the dog dream.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.720
Every dog is like,

21:28.720 --> 21:30.720
if one of us can just make it to 21,

21:30.720 --> 21:32.720
we're going to fucking party.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.720
I told you to quit smoking, Jerry.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.720
No, I mean, for a dog, that is three.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.720
So a three-year-old dog can stumble

21:38.720 --> 21:40.720
into a super America and say,

21:40.720 --> 21:42.720
let me get that high life, please.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.720
Yeah, I mean,

21:48.720 --> 21:50.720
you got to get your dog jacked.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.720
You got to get your dog fucking diesel.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.720
Yolked huge.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.720
And I don't know how you do that.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.720
I don't know how you do that.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.720
I don't know if there's dog gyms.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.720
I know you can take them somewhere

22:02.720 --> 22:04.720
to train them for Westminster and all that.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.720
But I don't know how you get them.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.720
There's no Ninja Warrior gyms for dogs, I don't think.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.720
Can dogs build muscle?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.720
I was a dog trainer for a while

22:12.720 --> 22:14.720
and I don't know the answer to this question.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.720
Can dogs develop new muscle?

22:16.720 --> 22:18.720
And I'm terrified of this.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.720
I mean, if you crank them full of pure whey

22:20.720 --> 22:22.720
and get them, you know,

22:22.720 --> 22:24.720
pulling tires, doing some CrossFit,

22:24.720 --> 22:26.720
five, you know,

22:26.720 --> 22:28.720
seven hours, five days a week,

22:28.720 --> 22:30.720
then they'll die.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.720
So don't do that.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.720
But there's got to be another way.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.720
Oh, I know.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.720
I freaking got it.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.720
Oh.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.720
You put the mask on them.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.720
Oh.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.720
From the mask.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.720
Okay, capital T, capital M, the mask.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.720
Or the son of mask,

22:52.720 --> 22:54.720
when the dog gets it on and gets really, really big.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.720
I think the dog gets on both of them, Gervin.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.720
So either one, you are correct.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.720
Somebody stop him.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.720
Somebody stop him, indeed.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.720
He's peeing all over everyone.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.720
And his pee is so hard, it's like a fire hose.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.720
It's so powerful, it has killed Jamie Kennedy.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.720
We are down one lead actor.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.720
Please, somebody save Jamie Kennedy

23:12.720 --> 23:14.720
from that dog.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.720
Did that dog just piss so hard

23:16.720 --> 23:18.720
that Jamie Kennedy died?

23:18.720 --> 23:20.720
That's a cool dog.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.720
Not another Kennedy.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.720
That there is an elf.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.720
Did you know that Jamie Kennedy is Robert Kennedy

23:26.720 --> 23:28.720
and John F. Kennedy's little brother?

23:28.720 --> 23:30.720
Did you know that?

23:30.720 --> 23:32.720
I did not know that, Travis.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.720
He's the last one.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.720
I started a new job about five months ago,

23:36.720 --> 23:38.720
and one of my coworkers and I started bonding

23:38.720 --> 23:40.720
over mediocre romance novels.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.720
I haven't read any since middle school

23:42.720 --> 23:44.720
because they're so heteronormative.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.720
Not hot.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.720
But I remember a lot about them

23:48.720 --> 23:50.720
because my mom still loves to read them all.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.720
My coworker is in her 60s,

23:52.720 --> 23:54.720
and she's just happy to have something to talk about,

23:54.720 --> 23:56.720
so I didn't mention this.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.720
Two months ago, she recommended this series

23:58.720 --> 24:00.720
of 20-ish books that she has all of

24:00.720 --> 24:02.720
and offered to lend me the first one.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.720
I accepted with no intention of reading it

24:04.720 --> 24:06.720
and returned it after a week saying it was really good.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.720
Oh, no! God damn it!

24:08.720 --> 24:10.720
This is before you fuck up!

24:10.720 --> 24:12.720
This is the breaking into the hotel breakfast

24:12.720 --> 24:16.720
of human social interchanges.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.720
This is rough.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.720
She came in the next day with the next three books.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.720
Now I'm on book eight.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.720
I have not read any of them.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.720
How do I make her stop?

24:26.720 --> 24:28.720
Oh, my God.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.720
And that's from, oh, God, there's actually 26 books.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.720
Folks, you have to tell us the names of these franchises.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.720
Yeah.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.720
And you have to reach out to us

24:36.720 --> 24:38.720
before you fuck up.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.720
But I will say at this point,

24:40.720 --> 24:42.720
it seems like you've already got

24:42.720 --> 24:44.720
a fine trajectory going.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.720
You've made it through eight.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.720
You've got 18 more to go.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.720
If you could just keep up this, like,

24:50.720 --> 24:52.720
take it away for a week, bring it back,

24:52.720 --> 24:54.720
like, yeah, super hot.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.720
I loved all the caressing.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.720
And then, like, maybe you can make it through all 26

24:58.720 --> 25:00.720
and come out the other side.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.720
Half a year gone, yes,

25:02.720 --> 25:04.720
but you're free now.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.720
Free from this genie's cave.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.720
Sorry, guys, I gotta go sign for a package.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.720
Yep.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.720
Oh, gotta sign for a package.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.720
Nice.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.720
This is how all great

25:16.720 --> 25:18.720
romance novels start, right?

25:18.720 --> 25:20.720
Yeah.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.720
Somebody shows up at your door with probably

25:22.720 --> 25:24.720
alcohol if you have to sign for it

25:24.720 --> 25:26.720
and be over 21.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.720
Griffin took out

25:28.720 --> 25:30.720
the stylus and whipped

25:30.720 --> 25:32.720
his stylus around,

25:32.720 --> 25:34.720
signing on the tiny

25:34.720 --> 25:36.720
electronic pad.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.720
The letter spilled out of his

25:38.720 --> 25:40.720
hand.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.720
Like so much black jizz

25:42.720 --> 25:44.720
first a G.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.720
Black ink jizz.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.720
Ink jizz first a G

25:48.720 --> 25:50.720
and an R

25:50.720 --> 25:52.720
and then an I and an F.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.720
Could you spell your last name for me,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.720
said the delivery person.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.720
I'm about to climb it.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.720
I'm totally gonna finish.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.720
Although I am gonna deliver

26:02.720 --> 26:04.720
an orgasm to you.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.720
I'm delivering a plentiful

26:06.720 --> 26:08.720
orgasm.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.720
Did you need another orgasm? I could be back

26:10.720 --> 26:12.720
tomorrow with another delivery.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.720
Or go back and add your middle

26:14.720 --> 26:16.720
name and I'll climax again.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.720
Yeah.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.720
What did I come back to?

26:20.720 --> 26:22.720
What did you come back to indeed, Griffin?

26:22.720 --> 26:24.720
Yeah.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.720
How was the delivery?

26:26.720 --> 26:28.720
I was signing for a package. Did you guys

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
already come up with like funny fake names

26:30.720 --> 26:32.720
for the thing? Cause I usually do those.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.720
But if you already did them, I don't want to double up.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.720
Wait, sign for what? Sign for a package?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.720
Wait, what?

26:38.720 --> 26:40.720
We were making it like you were in a romance novel

26:40.720 --> 26:42.720
where you were being romanced by the delivery person.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.720
Oh, and I was gonna make love to the mail carrier.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.720
Yeah, you said you had to sign for a package.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.720
Okay, so yeah, I can tell you

26:48.720 --> 26:50.720
what happened down there if you want.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.720
Yeah, make it saucy.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.720
His name was

26:54.720 --> 26:56.720
Garbanzo.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.720
Yeah, the sexiest name.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.720
He was eight feet

27:00.720 --> 27:02.720
long.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.720
Whoa!

27:04.720 --> 27:06.720
He handed me my

27:06.720 --> 27:08.720
package. I said,

27:08.720 --> 27:10.720
this looks like the

27:10.720 --> 27:12.720
special shoes I ordered

27:12.720 --> 27:14.720
for the boat. And then he said,

27:14.720 --> 27:16.720
yes, yes it is.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.720
You ordered

27:18.720 --> 27:20.720
special orthopedic boat shoes?

27:20.720 --> 27:22.720
I ordered boat shoes,

27:22.720 --> 27:24.720
but not boat shoes,

27:24.720 --> 27:26.720
but shoes for a boat. Do you know what I'm saying?

27:26.720 --> 27:28.720
Anyway, Garbanzo.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.720
Go into

27:30.720 --> 27:32.720
extreme detail. I'm done with

27:32.720 --> 27:34.720
pornography. Go into extreme detail about your boat shoes.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.720
Are they shaped like boats?

27:36.720 --> 27:38.720
Boat shoes. They breathe really well.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.720
Anyway, Garbanzo said,

27:40.720 --> 27:42.720
have fun on the boat. This is just chapter one.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.720
You don't bork in chapter one.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.720
Of course. I wish that they

27:46.720 --> 27:48.720
would. Just get that out of the way. Chapter one of the

27:48.720 --> 27:50.720
romance novel is where all

27:50.720 --> 27:52.720
the sex happens. And then the next 27

27:52.720 --> 27:54.720
chapters is just like a character doing

27:54.720 --> 27:56.720
their taxes. Yeah, but the problem

27:56.720 --> 27:58.720
is Garbanzo turned into

27:58.720 --> 28:00.720
a swarm of bats. He flew away.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.720
Classic. Sexy.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.720
Yeah, now how can I resist?

28:04.720 --> 28:06.720
The bats?

28:06.720 --> 28:08.720
Yeah, let me get it

28:08.720 --> 28:10.720
in that cloud of bats. Nothing

28:10.720 --> 28:12.720
makes me heartier than Garbanzo.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.720
The cloud swarm of bats.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.720
That's

28:16.720 --> 28:18.720
my favorite Night Vale character.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.720
In case anybody's been

28:20.720 --> 28:22.720
asking, my favorite Night Vale character is

28:22.720 --> 28:24.720
Garbanzo, the swarm of bats.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.720
It's also my favorite Magic Tavern

28:26.720 --> 28:28.720
character. It's a

28:28.720 --> 28:30.720
crossover

28:30.720 --> 28:32.720
event. And

28:32.720 --> 28:34.720
Gryphon has sex with him.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.720
Not yet.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.720
Magic Tavern already does

28:38.720 --> 28:40.720
have a living swarm of bats

28:40.720 --> 28:42.720
as a character. That's such a better

28:42.720 --> 28:44.720
show than ours. Should we go to the

28:44.720 --> 28:46.720
money zone at least? Yeah, they don't have

28:46.720 --> 28:48.720
a money zone.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.720
Go ahead and start.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.720
I gotta feed the cats.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.720
They're scratching at my door. Ooh.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.720
Gotta feed the cats. Uh oh.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.720
I wasn't here for the last time you did this,

29:06.720 --> 29:08.720
but are we gonna be like,

29:08.720 --> 29:10.720
does that make you horny, baby?

29:10.720 --> 29:12.720
No, Gryphon.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.720
Here's one about Casper.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.720
Casper makes mattresses

29:16.720 --> 29:18.720
and when you get on

29:18.720 --> 29:20.720
them and you fall asleep,

29:20.720 --> 29:22.720
then it's the best.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.720
The best dreams.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.720
You definitely get the best dreams.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.720
Your bones

29:28.720 --> 29:30.720
feel better and

29:30.720 --> 29:32.720
get longer while you sleep

29:32.720 --> 29:34.720
on them because of how it sort of

29:34.720 --> 29:36.720
cradles your natural geometry.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.720
Creates an environment

29:38.720 --> 29:40.720
that is really, really

29:40.720 --> 29:42.720
compatible with bone

29:42.720 --> 29:44.720
elongation.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.720
There is one thing. It's while you're

29:46.720 --> 29:48.720
asleep, you're actually absorbed

29:48.720 --> 29:50.720
within the mattress. Yes.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.720
As soon as you wake up, you're popped right back on top.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.720
So you're absolutely fine. You'll never know it.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.720
You won't know it unless

29:56.720 --> 29:58.720
the Goblin King comes up.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.720
Yes. Now you've got an

30:00.720 --> 30:02.720
issue, but Casper guarantees

30:02.720 --> 30:04.720
90.9.9999

30:04.720 --> 30:06.720
99% chance

30:06.720 --> 30:08.720
the Goblin King will not attack.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.720
No way. So

30:10.720 --> 30:12.720
we have not done any of the things that they

30:12.720 --> 30:14.720
want us to say yet. So here's a lot of that.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.720
They got free shipping and returns

30:16.720 --> 30:18.720
to the US and Canada.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.720
It's no hassle if you're not satisfied.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.720
You get to try it for 100 nights and then

30:22.720 --> 30:24.720
if you don't like it, you just send it right back

30:24.720 --> 30:26.720
and you banish the Goblin King right back to

30:26.720 --> 30:28.720
once he came.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.720
I think we all have Caspers at this

30:30.720 --> 30:32.720
point. You've heard us talk about how comfortable they are,

30:32.720 --> 30:34.720
but I'll say it again. It's pretty freaking

30:34.720 --> 30:36.720
comfortable. You can get $50 towards

30:36.720 --> 30:38.720
select mattresses by visiting

30:38.720 --> 30:40.720
casper.com slash brother and using the promo code

30:40.720 --> 30:42.720
brother at checkout, that's casper.com slash

30:42.720 --> 30:44.720
brother and promo code

30:44.720 --> 30:46.720
brother for $50 towards select mattresses.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.720
Terms and conditions apply.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.720
I'm starting to think that these businesses

30:50.720 --> 30:52.720
listen to our show because they've stopped including

30:52.720 --> 30:54.720
the phrase enter my brother in here.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.720
Yes. They've wised up.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.720
I would like to tell you about

30:58.720 --> 31:00.720
MeUndies. Now we've

31:00.720 --> 31:02.720
talked about MeUndies before. I could tell you

31:02.720 --> 31:04.720
about their underpants

31:04.720 --> 31:06.720
and shirts, which are like three times

31:06.720 --> 31:08.720
softer than cotton.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.720
They're different prints.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.720
You can get like solid colors, adventurous prints,

31:12.720 --> 31:14.720
you can match with your partner, whatever.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.720
I want to talk about the sleep pants,

31:16.720 --> 31:18.720
which is I think

31:18.720 --> 31:20.720
maybe the greatest invention ever given

31:20.720 --> 31:22.720
to humankind. Real good.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.720
They are the comfiest things

31:24.720 --> 31:26.720
I've ever worn, ever.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.720
And I would like to be buried

31:28.720 --> 31:30.720
in them. And you can get

31:30.720 --> 31:32.720
your 15% off your

31:32.720 --> 31:34.720
first pair of MeUndies free shipping

31:34.720 --> 31:36.720
and 100% satisfaction guarantee

31:36.720 --> 31:38.720
if you go to MeUndies.com

31:38.720 --> 31:40.720
slash my brother, that's MeUndies.com

31:40.720 --> 31:42.720
slash my brother.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.720
Do you have teeth?

31:44.720 --> 31:46.720
Yes.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.720
But if he wants the space between

31:48.720 --> 31:50.720
clean, he's got that covered,

31:50.720 --> 31:52.720
but what about the nasty fronts and backs?

31:52.720 --> 31:54.720
Well, that is the

31:54.720 --> 31:56.720
purview of Quip.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.720
The backs and fronts are

31:58.720 --> 32:00.720
awes. They're awes. Back away,

32:00.720 --> 32:02.720
what a pig. Oh, they're affordable

32:02.720 --> 32:04.720
teeth. Sorry.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.720
Are you doing

32:06.720 --> 32:08.720
something else right now while

32:08.720 --> 32:10.720
talking about this? No, I just

32:10.720 --> 32:12.720
sat back down. I'm trying to get my fucking bearings.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.720
Quip was designed to make brushing

32:14.720 --> 32:16.720
your teeth more simple, affordable, and

32:16.720 --> 32:18.720
even, dare we say it,

32:18.720 --> 32:20.720
enjoyable. They've got

32:20.720 --> 32:22.720
sensitive sonic vibrations

32:22.720 --> 32:24.720
and a built-in two-minute

32:24.720 --> 32:26.720
timer that pulses

32:26.720 --> 32:28.720
every 30 seconds to remind you to switch sides.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.720
Brush heads are automatically

32:30.720 --> 32:32.720
delivered on a dentist-recommended

32:32.720 --> 32:34.720
schedule every three months for just $5.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.720
You know, it's always exciting to get a

32:36.720 --> 32:38.720
package, and sometimes it's toothbrush

32:38.720 --> 32:40.720
heads. Quip is

32:40.720 --> 32:42.720
backed by over 20,000 dental

32:42.720 --> 32:44.720
professionals. Quip starts at just

32:44.720 --> 32:46.720
$25, and if you

32:46.720 --> 32:48.720
go to getquip

32:48.720 --> 32:50.720
.com

32:50.720 --> 32:52.720
slash my brother right

32:52.720 --> 32:54.720
now, you get your first refill

32:54.720 --> 32:56.720
pack for free with a Quip electric toothbrush.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.720
That's a refill pack

32:58.720 --> 33:00.720
for free at

33:00.720 --> 33:02.720
getquip

33:02.720 --> 33:04.720
.com slash

33:04.720 --> 33:06.720
my brother.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.720
Wow, that jingle

33:08.720 --> 33:10.720
was free, so they didn't even

33:10.720 --> 33:12.720
have to pay for that extra.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.720
Unlike Griffin Space Jam,

33:14.720 --> 33:16.720
which I had to pay $500,000.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.720
I'm so rich. Have you

33:18.720 --> 33:20.720
ever watched a movie so bad you

33:20.720 --> 33:22.720
just needed to talk to somebody about it?

33:22.720 --> 33:24.720
Well, here at the Flophouse, we watch a bad

33:24.720 --> 33:26.720
movie and then talk about it. Yeah,

33:26.720 --> 33:28.720
you don't have to do anything. We'll watch it and

33:28.720 --> 33:30.720
we'll talk it. We do the hard work.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.720
Featuring the beautiful vocal talents of

33:32.720 --> 33:34.720
Dan McCoy, Stuart

33:34.720 --> 33:36.720
Wellington, and me, America's

33:36.720 --> 33:38.720
rascal, Elliot Kalin. New episodes

33:38.720 --> 33:40.720
every other Saturday at MaximumFun.org

33:40.720 --> 33:42.720
or wherever you get your podcast, dude.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.720
Bye-bye.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.720
Bye-bye.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.720
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Level 9000,

33:54.720 --> 33:56.720
Drew Drew, Drew Davenport. Thank you, Drew.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.720
It's from an anonymous

33:58.720 --> 34:00.720
Yahoo Answers user, who I'm gonna call

34:00.720 --> 34:02.720
Baby Boy Asks.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.720
Alright.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.720
Jim Carrey tribute party?

34:06.720 --> 34:08.720
Smiley face emoticon?

34:08.720 --> 34:10.720
His best movies he's

34:10.720 --> 34:12.720
made. Top 6?

34:12.720 --> 34:14.720
Things I should decorate with. Food.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.720
Activities. Contest.

34:16.720 --> 34:18.720
Music. Ect.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.720
Which I believe is supposed to

34:22.720 --> 34:24.720
mean, etc.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.720
Anything to make this party off

34:26.720 --> 34:28.720
the roof.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.720
Ultimate.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.720
The thought, again. Anything to

34:34.720 --> 34:36.720
make this party off the roof. Ultimate.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.720
Ha ha. Smiley face emoticon.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.720
Please.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.720
And thanks. I would say

34:42.720 --> 34:44.720
just off the top of my head, if you

34:44.720 --> 34:46.720
want to make it

34:46.720 --> 34:48.720
like, a real

34:48.720 --> 34:50.720
ultimate Jim Carrey tribute party,

34:50.720 --> 34:52.720
you're going to need to reference

34:52.720 --> 34:54.720
Copper Mountain.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.720
The film he did in 1983

34:56.720 --> 34:58.720
that was a made-for-TV movie, co-starring

34:58.720 --> 35:00.720
Alan Thicke.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.720
That was basically

35:02.720 --> 35:04.720
an hour-long

35:04.720 --> 35:06.720
commercial for a

35:06.720 --> 35:08.720
Club Med location.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.720
That sounds great.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.720
Listen, a great film.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.720
You could also maybe do

35:14.720 --> 35:16.720
All in Good Taste.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.720
We know, we know. Hey, did you guys know

35:18.720 --> 35:20.720
that Travis knows a lot of Jim Carrey stuff?

35:20.720 --> 35:22.720
Yeah, we get it.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.720
Let's talk about snacks.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.720
Number one, he's Eggman in the new Sonic movie.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.720
So I would say eggs.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.720
And that one's taken care of.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.720
That one's taken care of.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.720
Maybe just pieces of rubber.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.720
In that TV show he's on,

35:36.720 --> 35:38.720
I think he's got a puppet or

35:38.720 --> 35:40.720
something named Mr. Pickles.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.720
So, pickles.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.720
How about some incredible Burt Wonder toast?

35:44.720 --> 35:46.720
That's good.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.720
It would be Burt toast.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.720
It would be another one of those things.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.720
Oh, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Guacamole.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.720
That's very good. Earth girls are cheesy.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.720
That's good. What's that one?

35:56.720 --> 35:58.720
Earth girls are easy.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.720
Yeah, I know, but like...

36:00.720 --> 36:02.720
Oh, it's just cheese, but you get cookie cutters

36:02.720 --> 36:04.720
and it's like, you know,

36:04.720 --> 36:06.720
shaped like a woman.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.720
There's also the Cable Pie.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.720
That's pretty good.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.720
You're gonna take all those spare

36:12.720 --> 36:14.720
HDMI cables or those red, white,

36:14.720 --> 36:16.720
and yellow cables that we don't use anymore

36:16.720 --> 36:18.720
and you're gonna put those in a short crust.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.720
Mm-hmm. Plum and plumber.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.720
Oh, delicious.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.720
It's a bunch of plums and you put

36:24.720 --> 36:26.720
a picture of Christopher Plummer on them.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.720
We're gonna start off the evening

36:30.720 --> 36:32.720
with some aperitifs.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.720
We got a sampling of different

36:34.720 --> 36:36.720
beers to enjoy. It's called the

36:36.720 --> 36:38.720
All Flighty, then.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.720
That's pretty good.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.720
It's a good place to start. The Man on the Moon pie.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.720
That's snacks. We got snacks

36:44.720 --> 36:46.720
that we fucking nailed down six years ago.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.720
Friar Friar.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.720
Things I should decorate with.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.720
I think a big sign over the front door

36:52.720 --> 36:54.720
of the party that says, do go in there

36:54.720 --> 36:56.720
is a good start.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.720
Yeah, it's good.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.720
End of that one, though.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.720
Decorations are harder than snacks.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.720
You blew right past snacks.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.720
I didn't blow right past snacks.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.720
We spent a long time in snacks,

37:10.720 --> 37:12.720
but we have lots of things to figure out.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.720
I agree myself on pie-reen.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.720
It's just like your pie.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.720
I can't believe this dude's

37:18.720 --> 37:20.720
playing fucking Dr. Robotnik.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.720
I need to take a minute

37:24.720 --> 37:26.720
away from the bit and just close my eyes

37:26.720 --> 37:28.720
and visualize that good

37:28.720 --> 37:30.720
wrench heat he's gonna bring to this

37:30.720 --> 37:32.720
honored role of Dr.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.720
Ivo Robotnik.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.720
Don't forget the series of

37:36.720 --> 37:38.720
unfortunate events heat too, Griffin.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.720
He's been so great in character roles

37:40.720 --> 37:42.720
in the last five to ten years.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.720
God, I can't wait.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.720
Hey, I've got an idea

37:46.720 --> 37:48.720
for the party.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.720
Why don't you have

37:50.720 --> 37:52.720
Ed Harris show up

37:52.720 --> 37:54.720
and just every once in a while

37:54.720 --> 37:56.720
peek at people from behind

37:56.720 --> 37:58.720
a corner or something like that

37:58.720 --> 38:00.720
with his camera.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.720
Wait, so is Ed Harris a decoration in your mind?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.720
Yeah, he's decoration.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.720
Ed Harris is sort of a performance.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.720
I do like that.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.720
Let's move from closet to closet

38:10.720 --> 38:12.720
and whisper like, zoom in.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.720
Zoom in.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.720
Darryl's double dipping.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.720
He's double dipping

38:18.720 --> 38:20.720
in the guacamole.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.720
Zoom in on Darryl's

38:22.720 --> 38:24.720
gross dip.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.720
So,

38:26.720 --> 38:28.720
I think activities.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.720
Mr. Popper's penguins. That one speaks for itself.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.720
Mm-hmm.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.720
Every time a new guest comes in,

38:34.720 --> 38:36.720
you say, I love you, Philip Morris.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.720
I say, yes, ma'am.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.720
That's a good sort of call and response.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.720
Also, you could all just have free cigarettes out.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.720
That could also be the smoking movie.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.720
That's good.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.720
Also, you could confront some of your friends

38:48.720 --> 38:50.720
who have been lying to you for a while.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.720
Like, if you know

38:52.720 --> 38:54.720
you have an untrustworthy friend,

38:54.720 --> 38:56.720
there's going to be a chance to be like, liar, liar,

38:56.720 --> 38:58.720
and then see who's lying.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.720
Or you could make it a fun party game,

39:00.720 --> 39:02.720
but I like mine better where it's like

39:02.720 --> 39:04.720
the culmination of maybe some

39:04.720 --> 39:06.720
deep-seated distrust.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.720
If we wanted to do a contest,

39:08.720 --> 39:10.720
we could just do

39:10.720 --> 39:12.720
Jim Carrey impressions.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.720
Well,

39:14.720 --> 39:16.720
the problem is everyone's super good at them.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.720
So, it just ends up being a tie.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.720
Like, Justin, do yours.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.720
Okay.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.720
Um, hello?

39:24.720 --> 39:26.720
Hey, I'm Latke.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.720
Okay.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.720
That's my impression of Jim

39:30.720 --> 39:32.720
doing an impression of Andy

39:32.720 --> 39:34.720
doing an impression of Latke from Taxi.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.720
Here, can I do one?

39:36.720 --> 39:38.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.720
Looks like they got murdered with a knife made out of their own bones.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.720
And that's from Dark Crimes,

39:42.720 --> 39:44.720
his 2016 movie he did.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.720
Ah, cool, cool, cool.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.720
Yeah, this is sort of a darker...

39:48.720 --> 39:50.720
Here, can I try again?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.720
Disgusting number keeps showing up.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.720
I love this character.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.720
I remember this film.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.720
Just finish the impression.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.720
Disgusting number keeps showing up

40:00.720 --> 40:02.720
all over the dang place.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.720
Did you figure it out yet?

40:04.720 --> 40:06.720
Farts.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.720
And that's, I believe...

40:16.720 --> 40:18.720
Oh no, Griffin broke himself.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.720
It's just nice to laugh.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.720
It's just nice to laugh.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.720
It really is.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.720
Did we do all of them? What didn't we do?

40:28.720 --> 40:30.720
Oh, music.

40:32.720 --> 40:36.720
Just play that fucking Cuban Pete from The Mask.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.720
Until everyone leaves.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.720
I think I could make it through three.

40:40.720 --> 40:44.720
It depends on how good the spotless mind guacamole is.

40:44.720 --> 40:48.720
Because that might get me to stay for a couple more.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.720
Yeah, I think that's it.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.720
Oh, with the Etcetera.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.720
I think Etcetera is just

40:54.720 --> 40:56.720
invite Jim Carrey to be there.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.720
He would have a great time.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.720
He's the only guest.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.720
He's the only guest. This party's almost certainly going to go off the roof.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.720
Someday...

41:10.720 --> 41:12.720
You guys promised me someday

41:12.720 --> 41:14.720
we can record a commentary track

41:14.720 --> 41:16.720
for Ace Ventura or Pet Detective Jr.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.720
I think about...

41:18.720 --> 41:20.720
Do you guys have things that you think about a lot?

41:20.720 --> 41:22.720
That you haven't seen?

41:22.720 --> 41:24.720
Yeah, my wife and kids.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.720
Theoretically.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.720
But you can't really bring yourself to actually ingest.

41:28.720 --> 41:32.720
Oh, so it would be a coming in fresh commentary track.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.720
Yeah, it would be like a first time watch.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.720
Because Ace Ventura or Pet Detective Jr. is like that for me.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.720
Came out in fucking 2009.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.720
Never seen it.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.720
I watched the trailer for it probably 500 times.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.720
And I've never watched the movie.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.720
Because I know it wouldn't be pleasurable.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.720
But I am like obsessed with the idea that it exists.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.720
I guess is the best way of putting it.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.720
Do you guys have stuff like that?

41:52.720 --> 41:54.720
I still have not seen...

41:54.720 --> 41:56.720
Oh, what's the fucking Johnny Depp?

41:56.720 --> 41:58.720
Mordecai. I still have not seen...

41:58.720 --> 42:00.720
I've seen a lot of Mordecai.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.720
But I couldn't finish it.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.720
I watched I think the first 25 minutes of it.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.720
Yeah, I was about to say Mordecai didn't age well.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.720
But Mordecai didn't birth well.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.720
Yeah.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.720
This is shame.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.720
How about another question?

42:14.720 --> 42:16.720
Yeah, I love that.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.720
Farm wisdom.

42:18.720 --> 42:20.720
Farm wisdom.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.720
Farm wisdom.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.720
Don't make a blunder down under farm wisdom.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.720
That's not farm wisdom.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.720
This is a farm wisdom.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.720
That's right.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.720
We're going to farm wisdom Australia in addition.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.720
From Ben Hetherington.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.720
No, wrong.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.720
No way was that right.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.720
Ben Hetherington.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.720
Yes, you fully skipped it.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.720
We fully did.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.720
I was coming in hot.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.720
There's a lot of letters all jumbled together.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.720
I was just trying to churn through.

42:50.720 --> 42:52.720
Ben Hetherington missed farm wisdom.

42:52.720 --> 42:54.720
And rather than

42:54.720 --> 42:56.720
complain like some people do when they miss

42:56.720 --> 42:58.720
bits, Ben made it happen.

42:58.720 --> 43:00.720
Bringing us some

43:00.720 --> 43:02.720
Australian farm

43:02.720 --> 43:04.720
wisdom.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.720
If you have farm wisdom, submit.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.720
Please do.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.720
This is one of my favorite segments to do.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.720
It's just hard to find the exact right flavor.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.720
But I think Ben has done an admirable job

43:14.720 --> 43:16.720
here. Kangaroos

43:16.720 --> 43:18.720
and emus

43:18.720 --> 43:20.720
cannot walk backwards.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.720
The structure of a kangaroo's pelvis and tail

43:22.720 --> 43:24.720
won't allow it. However,

43:24.720 --> 43:26.720
nobody knows why emus

43:26.720 --> 43:28.720
can't.

43:28.720 --> 43:30.720
It might just be won't.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.720
But that's why they're both featured on the

43:32.720 --> 43:34.720
Australian government's coat of arms

43:34.720 --> 43:36.720
and out

43:36.720 --> 43:38.720
in the 50 cent coin.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.720
They're supposed to signify

43:40.720 --> 43:42.720
that our country is always moving forward.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.720
I would maybe hazard

43:44.720 --> 43:46.720
that there are other reasons kangaroos

43:46.720 --> 43:48.720
are on the Australian currency.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.720
But I do like Ben's

43:50.720 --> 43:52.720
suggestion here.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.720
Yeah, ad astra and all that.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.720
Hmm. Ben?

43:56.720 --> 43:58.720
You got these things

43:58.720 --> 44:00.720
running around on a farm, bud? Maybe an emu?

44:00.720 --> 44:02.720
I'll give you that because they have the big eggs.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.720
But I've never had

44:04.720 --> 44:06.720
kanga milk, I don't think.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.720
People eat kanga meat.

44:08.720 --> 44:10.720
I mean kangaroo meat is

44:10.720 --> 44:12.720
pretty popular.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.720
There's commercial kangaroo farming.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.720
There's a commercial kangaroo industry.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.720
Yeah, so read a book, Griffin.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.720
Yeah, read a book.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.720
I would like to pause it, Ben, and I don't want to put you on blast,

44:22.720 --> 44:24.720
but I say this only because it's exactly what I would do.

44:24.720 --> 44:26.720
Is it possible that

44:26.720 --> 44:28.720
some people might know why

44:28.720 --> 44:30.720
emus don't work backward and you don't?

44:34.720 --> 44:36.720
Nobody knows.

44:36.720 --> 44:38.720
Okay.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.720
I bet somebody knows.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.720
Apparently, according to the

44:42.720 --> 44:44.720
Wikipedia article called

44:44.720 --> 44:46.720
kangaroo meat, that my day has taken

44:46.720 --> 44:48.720
a strange, twisty turn.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.720
I didn't expect to be here when I woke up.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.720
There's a thing called kangatarianism.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.720
And that's where you

44:54.720 --> 44:56.720
only kangaroo

44:56.720 --> 44:58.720
meat. You're so wild

44:58.720 --> 45:00.720
for it. And it's apparently

45:00.720 --> 45:02.720
based on environmental and ethical grounds.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.720
Unsurprising.

45:04.720 --> 45:06.720
Goats smell really bad. Surprising.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.720
It's a common occurrence

45:08.720 --> 45:10.720
here to catch wild goats,

45:10.720 --> 45:12.720
and the best way to do so

45:12.720 --> 45:14.720
is to track them by smell.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.720
Wild goats

45:16.720 --> 45:18.720
are common in areas in northern

45:18.720 --> 45:20.720
New South Wales and southern

45:20.720 --> 45:22.720
Queensland and Australia, and can fetch

45:22.720 --> 45:24.720
a tiny profit when sold to a goat farm.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.720
Even with our especially blunt

45:26.720 --> 45:28.720
sense of smell, a person can tell

45:28.720 --> 45:30.720
the size and distance of a goat herd

45:30.720 --> 45:32.720
at distances of up

45:32.720 --> 45:34.720
to a mile.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.720
Yeah, I mean, goats don't smell

45:36.720 --> 45:38.720
very good.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.720
Damn, that was funny!

45:40.720 --> 45:42.720
I'm just on the Wikipedia

45:42.720 --> 45:44.720
page called kangaroo industry, and I'm

45:44.720 --> 45:46.720
trying to turn my fucking ignorance

45:46.720 --> 45:48.720
ship right around. You can't get me

45:48.720 --> 45:50.720
I'm reading about the kangaroo

45:50.720 --> 45:52.720
meat industry, and you come at me and you're like

45:52.720 --> 45:54.720
goats don't smell good. There's

45:54.720 --> 45:56.720
two pieces of information presented to me. I'm

45:56.720 --> 45:58.720
going to go with the savouriest nug.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.720
Dingo's eating lamb

46:00.720 --> 46:02.720
has been a big problem for stock farmers in Australia,

46:02.720 --> 46:04.720
and the easiest solution is to buy

46:04.720 --> 46:06.720
alpacas. Alpacas hate

46:06.720 --> 46:08.720
the living shit out of dogs.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.720
Wild or domestic, it will

46:10.720 --> 46:12.720
often bomb a sheep and act as their guardians.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.720
Alpacas can deliver a devastating

46:14.720 --> 46:16.720
kick.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.720
And a devastating insult.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.720
Yeah, they're so mean. They're insult

46:20.720 --> 46:22.720
comedies beyond reproach.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.720
Alpacas can deliver a kick

46:24.720 --> 46:26.720
as their hooves will grow in

46:26.720 --> 46:28.720
displayed claws if not trimmed,

46:28.720 --> 46:30.720
and can hit anything within two

46:30.720 --> 46:32.720
yards in any direction.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.720
The lamb birth rate can be

46:34.720 --> 46:36.720
significantly improved by

46:36.720 --> 46:38.720
having alpacas in the herd

46:38.720 --> 46:40.720
because they make sheep feel safe, and the

46:40.720 --> 46:42.720
reduced stress allows the ewes

46:42.720 --> 46:44.720
to carry a lamb to term.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.720
This is fucking

46:46.720 --> 46:48.720
soup to nuts

46:48.720 --> 46:50.720
bananas. What this

46:50.720 --> 46:52.720
has said is

46:52.720 --> 46:54.720
like, let's just

46:54.720 --> 46:56.720
take it one thing at a time.

46:56.720 --> 46:58.720
Okay, the dingos eat lambs.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.720
Yes, that all tracks for me.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.720
Alpacas hate dogs.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.720
Okay, I will have to take

47:04.720 --> 47:06.720
your word for it on that. Alpacas

47:06.720 --> 47:08.720
can deliver a devastating

47:08.720 --> 47:10.720
kick as their hooves will

47:10.720 --> 47:12.720
grow in displayed claws if not

47:12.720 --> 47:14.720
trimmed. So you basically have to choose

47:14.720 --> 47:16.720
an alpaca that you are making

47:16.720 --> 47:18.720
bad already. You are

47:18.720 --> 47:20.720
letting grow into a battling alpaca.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.720
And can

47:22.720 --> 47:24.720
hit anything within two

47:24.720 --> 47:26.720
yards.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.720
That's six feet. What?

47:28.720 --> 47:30.720
What are these

47:30.720 --> 47:32.720
alpacas fucking doing?

47:32.720 --> 47:34.720
Yeah, they look. In what sense

47:34.720 --> 47:36.720
Ben? They look so goofy, but

47:36.720 --> 47:38.720
they're actually the predator.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.720
Apparently.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.720
They can kick up to six feet.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.720
Am I understanding that correctly?

47:44.720 --> 47:46.720
If I'm understanding it correctly, up to six feet.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.720
I don't see how it's possible.

47:48.720 --> 47:50.720
I think two feet of that's just

47:50.720 --> 47:52.720
claws.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.720
I also, I think my

47:54.720 --> 47:56.720
favorite part of this though, is like a

47:56.720 --> 47:58.720
sheep looks around, sees what

47:58.720 --> 48:00.720
he has to assume is a giant version

48:00.720 --> 48:02.720
of itself and says, that

48:02.720 --> 48:04.720
makes me feel comfortable fucking.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.720
That's chill as hell. I'm gonna

48:06.720 --> 48:08.720
totally carry this baby to term now. Look at that

48:08.720 --> 48:10.720
giant ass sheep here.

48:10.720 --> 48:12.720
If I looked over and there was like a twelve foot

48:12.720 --> 48:14.720
Travis. His legs

48:14.720 --> 48:16.720
were guns.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.720
I feel comfortable now.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.720
I'm horny as hell.

48:20.720 --> 48:22.720
Let's go. How about a question

48:22.720 --> 48:24.720
or is there more farm wisdom?

48:24.720 --> 48:26.720
That's all the farm wisdom I have. I like that.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.720
I mean I ask for more as if I need more.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.720
I am sated. That's good. That's good stuff.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.720
Thank you Ben. Folks, keep that farm wisdom

48:32.720 --> 48:34.720
coming in. Would love to

48:34.720 --> 48:36.720
have a little bit more of it. How about another

48:36.720 --> 48:38.720
question here. Every so often

48:38.720 --> 48:40.720
some coworkers and I will go out for a night of

48:40.720 --> 48:42.720
KOK. We all have fun,

48:42.720 --> 48:44.720
but I'm easily the worst singer.

48:44.720 --> 48:46.720
Kinda screechy. God I love that fucking

48:46.720 --> 48:48.720
awareness. Inspirational.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.720
I'm the worst singer in the group and

48:50.720 --> 48:52.720
this draws a lot of teasing from the whole office floor.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.720
I have a good sense of humor

48:54.720 --> 48:56.720
and I'm happy that everyone can laugh at my

48:56.720 --> 48:58.720
mangled 80's hits. But I thought

48:58.720 --> 49:00.720
taking an actual singing lesson would help me get

49:00.720 --> 49:02.720
out of the comically bad range. To my surprise

49:02.720 --> 49:04.720
a number of my coworkers were very against

49:04.720 --> 49:06.720
the idea of lessons. Saying that I was

49:06.720 --> 49:08.720
taking it too seriously and being a

49:08.720 --> 49:10.720
killjoy. Should I continue

49:10.720 --> 49:12.720
with the lessons or is it wrong for me

49:12.720 --> 49:14.720
to deprive everyone of my unique

49:14.720 --> 49:16.720
voice? And that's from Music Al

49:16.720 --> 49:18.720
in Mobile, Alabama. I'm gonna go

49:18.720 --> 49:20.720
super Saiyan over here.

49:20.720 --> 49:22.720
I've never been confronted

49:22.720 --> 49:24.720
by our questions

49:24.720 --> 49:26.720
as much as I have been this one episode.

49:26.720 --> 49:28.720
Yeah. Because hey

49:28.720 --> 49:30.720
hey, hey

49:30.720 --> 49:32.720
why did you tell your coworkers about the

49:32.720 --> 49:34.720
singing lessons?

49:34.720 --> 49:36.720
Why did you tell your coworkers about the singing

49:36.720 --> 49:38.720
lessons? You didn't wanna have

49:38.720 --> 49:40.720
that she's all that

49:40.720 --> 49:42.720
moment where you get up there and you're like oh yeah

49:42.720 --> 49:44.720
you made fun of me in high school when

49:44.720 --> 49:46.720
I had this job in saying weird. Well

49:46.720 --> 49:48.720
look at me now.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.720
I am like a bird.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.720
And you sound that good.

49:52.720 --> 49:54.720
Like that.

49:54.720 --> 49:56.720
Like an angel. Like I just sounded.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.720
Cause I took singing lessons. I didn't tell anybody

49:58.720 --> 50:00.720
about it. I hate to

50:00.720 --> 50:02.720
bring it to you but I'm afraid

50:02.720 --> 50:04.720
period.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.720
But I'm also afraid that your

50:06.720 --> 50:08.720
coworkers like

50:08.720 --> 50:10.720
that you're not good at karaoke cause

50:10.720 --> 50:12.720
it makes them feel better at it.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.720
And they're gonna say like oh you're taking it too

50:14.720 --> 50:16.720
seriously. But they're afraid that you're

50:16.720 --> 50:18.720
gonna become a dominant karaoke-er.

50:18.720 --> 50:20.720
And that they

50:20.720 --> 50:22.720
cause here's the thing. If you

50:22.720 --> 50:24.720
stop being the bad one, someone

50:24.720 --> 50:26.720
else is gonna become the bad one.

50:26.720 --> 50:28.720
And they're all afraid it's them.

50:28.720 --> 50:30.720
Too true.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.720
You need another reason

50:32.720 --> 50:34.720
to be getting good at singing.

50:34.720 --> 50:36.720
I think maybe you're trying to get up on

50:36.720 --> 50:38.720
the voice. I think you're trying to meet Gwen.

50:38.720 --> 50:40.720
I think you're trying to meet Gwen and Fam.

50:40.720 --> 50:42.720
Can I

50:42.720 --> 50:44.720
proffer this?

50:44.720 --> 50:46.720
Stop going to karaoke.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.720
Keep taking singing lessons.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.720
Six months from now,

50:50.720 --> 50:52.720
the friends are all at karaoke.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.720
And then a new singer

50:54.720 --> 50:56.720
enters. They're wearing a

50:56.720 --> 50:58.720
tiger mask and a tiger costume.

50:58.720 --> 51:00.720
They're an amazing

51:00.720 --> 51:02.720
singer.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.720
No one can guess why this tiger has entered

51:04.720 --> 51:06.720
the karaoke room

51:06.720 --> 51:08.720
they have rented. They're scared for their lives.

51:08.720 --> 51:10.720
Hours pass.

51:10.720 --> 51:12.720
Is it a believable tiger costume?

51:12.720 --> 51:14.720
It's a

51:14.720 --> 51:16.720
very colorful

51:16.720 --> 51:18.720
and powerful.

51:18.720 --> 51:20.720
And hours pass. Your friends drink

51:20.720 --> 51:22.720
with the tiger. They bond with the tiger.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.720
They learn the tiger's likes

51:24.720 --> 51:26.720
and dislikes.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.720
The end of the night comes.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.720
You exchange numbers

51:30.720 --> 51:32.720
with a guy that

51:32.720 --> 51:34.720
you met there. You go home.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.720
You lie down. You realize that you forgot

51:36.720 --> 51:38.720
to dramatically reveal that you had been

51:38.720 --> 51:40.720
the tiger all along.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.720
You remind yourself the next time

51:42.720 --> 51:44.720
for sure, when you show up

51:44.720 --> 51:46.720
at karaoke, you will definitely

51:46.720 --> 51:48.720
definitely definitely pull off

51:48.720 --> 51:50.720
your mask dramatically to reveal that you were

51:50.720 --> 51:52.720
in fact the tiger all along.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.720
And that beautiful voice was attached to

51:54.720 --> 51:56.720
the former

51:56.720 --> 51:58.720
not so great singer.

51:58.720 --> 52:00.720
Time goes by. You realize it's been

52:00.720 --> 52:02.720
three years. You married that guy.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.720
You're still the tiger.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.720
You look back. You wonder

52:06.720 --> 52:08.720
what have I become? And the answer is you've become the

52:08.720 --> 52:10.720
tiger. You're more comfortable now as the tiger

52:10.720 --> 52:12.720
than you've ever been before.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.720
And then one day he pulls off your mask

52:14.720 --> 52:16.720
and your head falls off.

52:18.720 --> 52:20.720
You go back to karaoke.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.720
They don't remember the tiger.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.720
So we're basically starting from scratch

52:24.720 --> 52:26.720
again.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.720
You can just be a great singer. You don't have to be a great

52:28.720 --> 52:30.720
singer to excel at karaoke.

52:30.720 --> 52:32.720
There are two songs.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.720
Our former boss,

52:34.720 --> 52:36.720
Christopher Grant, sings

52:36.720 --> 52:38.720
does karaoke with a passion and

52:38.720 --> 52:40.720
a gusto that I find profoundly moving

52:40.720 --> 52:42.720
and the gusto and passion are on

52:42.720 --> 52:44.720
point and I'm going to stop there. But

52:44.720 --> 52:46.720
Chris has also through his karaoke

52:46.720 --> 52:48.720
artistry introduced me

52:48.720 --> 52:50.720
to Hames the Wire

52:50.720 --> 52:52.720
and Telephone Line by

52:52.720 --> 52:54.720
Yellow

52:54.720 --> 52:56.720
that I had never heard either of those songs before.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.720
Two songs that I adore brought to me

52:58.720 --> 53:00.720
by the artistry of one Christopher

53:00.720 --> 53:02.720
Grant and his karaoke

53:02.720 --> 53:04.720
skills. It doesn't matter how talented

53:04.720 --> 53:06.720
you are. Now let me say this though.

53:06.720 --> 53:08.720
Don't do cake. You're going to be

53:08.720 --> 53:10.720
tempted to do cake. But then

53:10.720 --> 53:12.720
one minute into cake you're going to realize

53:12.720 --> 53:14.720
it's pretty fucking boring.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.720
People liked cake when it was cake

53:16.720 --> 53:18.720
but they don't like me faux

53:18.720 --> 53:20.720
caking out here because it's just mostly

53:20.720 --> 53:22.720
talking about cars. I'm basically talking

53:22.720 --> 53:24.720
about driving fast.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.720
I don't think

53:26.720 --> 53:28.720
that this is a great

53:28.720 --> 53:30.720
karaoke. You don't have to sing good to do karaoke. You do

53:30.720 --> 53:32.720
have to love the song you're doing.

53:32.720 --> 53:34.720
I've seen so many people make the mistake of doing like

53:34.720 --> 53:36.720
I'm going to do a funny song

53:36.720 --> 53:38.720
and then they most likely

53:38.720 --> 53:40.720
don't know the song well enough to do

53:40.720 --> 53:42.720
it. But two, halfway through

53:42.720 --> 53:44.720
everyone's like okay I get it and now we

53:44.720 --> 53:46.720
have another like five minutes of meatloaf

53:46.720 --> 53:48.720
left. Yeah practice your

53:48.720 --> 53:50.720
songs at home folks because you never know.

53:50.720 --> 53:52.720
It's so important to be

53:52.720 --> 53:54.720
great at karaoke. It's the most important thing.

53:54.720 --> 53:56.720
That is going to do it for us

53:56.720 --> 53:58.720
on My Brother My Brother Me this week.

53:58.720 --> 54:00.720
Thank you so much for indulging

54:00.720 --> 54:02.720
us and letting us

54:02.720 --> 54:04.720
just jab your ear off here.

54:04.720 --> 54:06.720
We barely let you get a word in

54:06.720 --> 54:08.720
edgewise. But we

54:08.720 --> 54:10.720
very much do appreciate it. Hey can I

54:10.720 --> 54:12.720
real quick before I forget like I forgot

54:12.720 --> 54:14.720
last week. We're going to be on the going

54:14.720 --> 54:16.720
on the JoCo Cruise soon.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.720
Which is very exciting. But out there

54:18.720 --> 54:20.720
on that there open ocean we won't have much

54:20.720 --> 54:22.720
internet. So if you're going to be on the cruise

54:22.720 --> 54:24.720
and you have a question that you

54:24.720 --> 54:26.720
would like us to like answer please

54:26.720 --> 54:28.720
send it in now and include

54:28.720 --> 54:30.720
like JoCo Cruise in the

54:30.720 --> 54:32.720
subject line so we can go ahead and put together a question

54:32.720 --> 54:34.720
list for our live shows on

54:34.720 --> 54:36.720
the boat. Speaking of

54:36.720 --> 54:38.720
next week's episode on March

54:38.720 --> 54:40.720
11th is going to be our live show from New Orleans.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.720
I just edited it and

54:42.720 --> 54:44.720
dang that was a fun one.

57:36.720 --> 57:38.720
taken and the mall pod fairy was

short and I you know I'm just gonna say it
