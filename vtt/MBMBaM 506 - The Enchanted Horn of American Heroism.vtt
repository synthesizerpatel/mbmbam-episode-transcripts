00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.560
Well, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:46.560 --> 00:49.760
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.040
I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.040 --> 00:57.200
I am your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:57.200 --> 01:02.640
Isn't it rich? There has to be a

01:02.640 --> 01:04.960
certain separation. Don't you approve?

01:04.960 --> 01:08.000
There's so many songs. There's a lot of songs.

01:09.680 --> 01:14.080
Okay. Is this the only song you know?

01:14.080 --> 01:19.760
It doesn't even apply. There's lots of songs, I know.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.680
But that song doesn't even apply to this. Are we the clowns?

01:23.680 --> 01:29.440
No, we've always been the clowns. It's the 10-year anniversary spectacular

01:29.440 --> 01:32.400
that we are not putting extra effort into. Why?

01:33.120 --> 01:40.000
Well, one, we did something different for our 500th episode and you need consistency right now.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.160
We can't just throw another really special episode on you out of nowhere.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.000
The whiplash. Come on.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.400
Secondly, it's just a hard time right now, okay?

01:51.440 --> 01:52.560
Get up our butts.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.000
You know what? Thirdly, we're tired. 10 years of this.

01:56.000 --> 01:56.800
10 years.

01:58.560 --> 02:04.480
Do the math, folks. This is episode 506. In 10 years, we have missed 14 episodes.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.360
Not bad.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.360
Not bad. Not a bad hit rate.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.760
That's 1.4 episodes a year we've missed.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.360
Hey, everyone, let's go on a trip back in time to 2010.

02:16.320 --> 02:21.280
What were we all doing? Well, in theaters, we were watching The King's Speech.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.080
Uh-huh. I thought I haven't seen it.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.840
We were enjoying Winter's Bone as a nation.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.160
No, I didn't read it.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.720
It seems like a million years. Winter's Bone. Can you even remember?

02:32.720 --> 02:38.400
Toy Story 3? It's like decoding ancient hieroglyphs, isn't it?

02:38.960 --> 02:41.200
I'll never forget when Justin called us and said,

02:41.200 --> 02:46.720
guys, I know how we can make a quick buck. We'll just start this podcasting thing.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.960
The money is there. We can do whatever.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.800
We'll just phone something in and get that sweet cache.

02:52.800 --> 02:57.280
He said, we'll get that sweet cache for inflation, counting for inflation.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.440
He knew, like in the context of this conversation,

02:59.440 --> 03:02.240
he was like, counting for inflation, this is going to be a lot of money 10 years from now.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.520
And also, I just got out of Winter's Bone in the theater,

03:05.520 --> 03:09.120
and I drove home listening to Dynamite by Teo Cruz,

03:09.120 --> 03:12.000
because it's 2010, and that's how we fucking do things this year.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.320
I did a double feature, King's Speech and Winter's Bone,

03:16.320 --> 03:21.760
and now I'm ready for the yucks. So let's get that comedy money.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.680
I want to keep talking about 2010 for a second, the different world we live in.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.200
I just wanted to mention one of the big things that happened in 2010

03:31.200 --> 03:37.440
is 33 Chilean miners were trapped in a mine a half mile underground

03:37.440 --> 03:44.560
and then emerged safely from that mine after two months.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.040
So that's 10 years since the Chilean miners thing.

03:47.040 --> 03:51.200
And of course, the Xbox Kinect came out and changed gaming forever.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.960
The Good Wife with Juliana Margulies.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.880
How about that? How about them fucking apples?

04:00.880 --> 04:05.920
And it's now anamorphed into The Good Fight on CBS All Access,

04:05.920 --> 04:06.960
if you want to check that out.

04:06.960 --> 04:12.160
Check that out, but what a difference 10 years makes.

04:12.160 --> 04:18.480
The Good Wife with Juliana Margulies going into the second season in 2010,

04:18.480 --> 04:22.160
three young boys with dreams in their eyes and their hearts

04:22.160 --> 04:25.360
and sweat on their brow put together a podcasting empire.

04:25.360 --> 04:29.040
10 years pass, now it's The Good Fight on CBS All Access.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.280
Still a great show, not as much Juliana Margulies.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.560
Too true. Couldn't hold on to Juliana.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.240
So let's just do a regular show and not make a big deal out of it, okay?

04:38.240 --> 04:44.240
It's been 10 years and I can't wait for 10 more.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.920
Can I listen to CeeLo Green's Fuck You or Forget You?

04:48.960 --> 04:51.440
Damn y'all, can I just, 2010, real quick,

04:51.440 --> 04:54.400
Rollin' in the Deep by Adele, Runaway by Kanye West,

04:54.400 --> 04:56.480
Just the Way You Are by Bruno Mars,

04:56.480 --> 04:58.640
Super Bass by Nicki Minaj,

04:58.640 --> 05:00.480
Dancing on My Own by Robin,

05:00.480 --> 05:02.400
California Girls by Katy Perry,

05:03.360 --> 05:05.120
Fucking Firework by Katy Perry.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.320
Like, hello, one year? Are you sure?

05:08.320 --> 05:10.240
Moves Like Jagger by Maroon 5?

05:11.120 --> 05:13.440
Are you sure in one year you want to do all that?

05:13.440 --> 05:15.760
Okay. Call Your Girlfriend by Robin.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.040
Fine. That's cool.

05:17.040 --> 05:17.540
Damn.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.720
Hey, and let's just take a quick look over at the movies.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.680
It's just Avatar.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.560
That was the only movie in 2010.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.280
Oh!

05:25.280 --> 05:25.840
Yeah.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.680
So was Winter's Bone with it, like, as you were watching Avatar,

05:29.680 --> 05:31.040
it was like buried in it?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.400
It was a spinoff.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.200
Oh!

05:35.200 --> 05:36.000
It was a spinoff.

05:36.640 --> 05:36.800
Okay.

05:36.800 --> 05:40.240
Hey, real though, though, can I just say though, real quick, though?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.440
If I could just say real quick?

05:41.440 --> 05:42.880
Yeah, give it to us real quick, juice.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.160
I'm looking at that box office for 2010, right at 8, 9, 10,

05:46.160 --> 05:48.640
you got Despicable Me, Shrek, Forever After,

05:48.640 --> 05:49.760
How to Train Your Dragon.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.880
Are you okay?

05:50.880 --> 05:51.200
We're doing great.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.560
Is everybody all right?

05:52.560 --> 05:53.360
Holy shit.

05:54.320 --> 05:54.820
Yeah.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.680
Anyway, 2010 was a banger of a year.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.520
Zolo, never forget it,

05:59.520 --> 06:01.920
beats the shit out of our current sort of situation.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.440
Yeah, so much better than our year.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.200
Yeah, Tightrope by Janelle MonÃ¡e, come on.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.400
Let's go back, take me back.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.760
Earlier this week, I was doing some gardening with my sister.

06:10.560 --> 06:15.680
It was hard to concentrate because two cats were boisterously making love beyond the hedge.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.000
Our cat is, our yard is a cat hotspot,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.560
so this is likely not the last time it will happen.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.160
I want to spend more time in the garden,

06:24.160 --> 06:27.760
but I'm afraid the ambiance will be broken by a couple of cats getting down.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.840
What can I do about these feisty felines?

06:29.840 --> 06:32.880
That's from Yard Dweller.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.800
I hate doing animal questions.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.080
You know what the problem is?

06:36.080 --> 06:38.000
I don't know fucking anything about animals,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.560
but a lot of people on internet defo do.

06:40.560 --> 06:40.960
Right.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.200
And they definitely want to talk about.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.840
I don't think we've ever answered an animal question

06:45.840 --> 06:52.320
that like a SWAT team of 30 animal experts didn't fall through the skylight like,

06:52.320 --> 06:54.560
no, wait, the horse, you can't do that.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.040
His feet are actually made of nails or whatever.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.800
Justin, you might not know from cats,

06:58.800 --> 07:01.120
but I know you know about fucking.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.960
Justin does know about, no, no, come on, dude.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.240
That's why we all call you the fuck master.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.800
So now you're infringing on blank checks, trademarks.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.280
That's great.

07:11.280 --> 07:15.200
Okay, the fuck doctor is here, Justin.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.240
He doesn't know anything about cats.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.360
Professor fuck.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.600
Professor fuck is here and-

07:19.600 --> 07:20.640
You don't need to know about cats.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.720
You just need to know how to stop people.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.920
But it could be linked.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.760
Stop something from fucking.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.200
Justin's point could still hold though,

07:27.200 --> 07:28.880
because we could be like, well, just chase them off

07:28.880 --> 07:30.000
so they don't have sex.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.640
And then we will get like 50 tweets from people like,

07:32.640 --> 07:34.960
no, cats have to have sex or they'll die.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.000
And it's like, ah, man.

07:36.880 --> 07:37.360
Eventually.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.800
Eventually, I guess that's true.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.920
Broadly speaking, as a species,

07:41.920 --> 07:43.920
maybe we need to focus more on like,

07:43.920 --> 07:48.720
what is making your yard conducive to cat fucking?

07:48.720 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, you've turned your yard into a sort of feline,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.520
sort of Caligula den.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.920
What if you, do you just leave saucers of milk?

07:59.920 --> 08:02.720
And also, what makes cat horny?

08:04.640 --> 08:07.200
Well, I mean, like I said,

08:07.200 --> 08:09.600
I think that you could just universally describe things

08:09.600 --> 08:11.680
that wouldn't make anything horny.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.440
You know, like as you've always said,

08:13.440 --> 08:16.560
saucer milk, comfortable sheets.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.600
Cat's movie makes humans horny.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.040
Yeah, so human movies.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.440
You think a human movie.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.720
Any movie about humans.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.920
So just, I guess, do you have pornographic films

08:30.560 --> 08:33.760
running in your yard on like little iPod Nanos?

08:34.480 --> 08:35.760
That might be part of the problem.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.520
Yeah, get rid of those.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.600
Did you say sheets?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.520
Comfortable sheets, yeah.

08:42.160 --> 08:42.880
In your yard?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.040
Well, I know this is just a bit,

08:45.040 --> 08:46.480
well, I was just throwing noodles.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.640
You're assuming that this person has maybe left

08:48.640 --> 08:50.640
some comfortable sheets in their yard.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.400
No, but maybe there's something replicating

08:52.400 --> 08:53.200
comfortable sheets.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.840
Maybe there's some really smooth ivy, right?

08:55.840 --> 08:59.120
And they're like, oh, this is the cat equivalent of sheets.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.320
I want a bone on this.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.720
Right, you need to get rid of that ivy.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.600
I like that Justin took umbrage with that

09:05.600 --> 09:08.640
and not with my suggestion that you have iPod Nanos

09:08.640 --> 09:11.440
showing pornography as if you've set in a bunch of different

09:11.440 --> 09:15.360
sort of drive-in smut theaters for borrowers

09:15.360 --> 09:17.920
and Honey, I Shrunk the Kid situations.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.360
All right, counter-argument.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.600
The iPod Nanos have to be somewhere.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.800
We bought a lot of them.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.680
Where are they now?

09:23.680 --> 09:24.400
I don't have one.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.120
You don't have one.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.080
He doesn't have one.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.840
So they're somewhere, right?

09:27.840 --> 09:29.840
We kept eating them, didn't we?

09:29.840 --> 09:30.400
As a dare.

09:30.400 --> 09:30.900
Yep.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.120
Just kept munching them.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.200
You know, maybe it's just that your yard is a place

09:37.200 --> 09:39.840
where cats feel comfortable having something.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.360
Maybe it's not an arousal thing.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.480
They're just like, you know what?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.440
I feel like I can really be myself here

09:45.440 --> 09:46.240
and really let go.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.600
It's like the sandals for cats, you know?

09:49.600 --> 09:52.160
They go, they feel comfortable there.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.040
It's all inclusive.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.000
And they're able to let their hair down

09:56.000 --> 09:58.400
and really make love, really.

09:58.400 --> 10:03.040
I mean, this is for fun sex for these cats, maybe.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.960
Yeah, I mean, it could just be a snowball effect

10:06.960 --> 10:09.920
where a couple of cats fucked in your yard once

10:09.920 --> 10:11.680
and then other cats saw that and they were like,

10:11.680 --> 10:13.920
oh, it's safe to fuck in that yard.

10:13.920 --> 10:14.320
Yep.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.840
So I think you do need to,

10:16.400 --> 10:19.360
and this may be one of the more irresponsible suggestions

10:19.360 --> 10:20.560
I've sort of put out there,

10:21.120 --> 10:25.040
but get a lover and you both dress up like kitty cats

10:25.040 --> 10:28.960
and go in your neighbor's yard and start boisterously plowing

10:29.840 --> 10:34.240
but just be like, meow, this butt is the cat's pajamas

10:34.880 --> 10:35.520
or say whatever it is.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.200
They would just say our pajamas.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.200
This is good as our, yeah.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.800
This is the us meow.

10:43.840 --> 10:49.120
But do it loud and make it seem appealing like,

10:49.120 --> 10:52.080
oh, that yard must have better sexual energy in it

10:52.080 --> 10:55.200
because I'd see two enormous bipedal cats

10:56.320 --> 10:58.720
and so that's the party I want to be on.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.000
Now, how do you do this without your neighbor seeing

11:02.000 --> 11:04.960
or anyone else seeing or God seeing God in heaven

11:04.960 --> 11:07.360
who sees all, you don't want him to see this one.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.240
No, not this one.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.640
I don't know, maybe a tarp.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.840
That's great, Travis.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.560
That's great.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.560
Up on sticks, so you have room underneath it

11:16.560 --> 11:18.480
so the cats can see from the side

11:18.480 --> 11:22.560
but God looking down from the sky can't see around the tarp.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.920
He's afraid of tarps.

11:23.920 --> 11:24.320
I have a-

11:24.320 --> 11:24.960
Can't see through them.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.680
It's like his lead.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.600
Hey, I have a Yahoo here.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.160
Can I read it?

11:30.480 --> 11:31.840
God can't see through tarps.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.280
Can't see through tarps.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.040
I'm sad you said that at the end

11:35.040 --> 11:37.040
because if I wasn't bored of this question by now,

11:37.040 --> 11:39.600
I think I would hang out there and play with that

11:39.600 --> 11:41.520
but I'm done pretty good.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.440
I'm pretty good done at this point.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.120
This is a super cool Yahoo

11:45.120 --> 11:47.120
that the prospector Merritt Palmer sent in.

11:47.120 --> 11:47.440
Thank you.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.120
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.680
I really wish somebody had stamped their name on this one.

11:51.680 --> 11:55.200
So instead, I'm going to call it Susannanana.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.440
Susannanana asks-

11:57.440 --> 11:58.240
Susannanana.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.960
If the founding fathers left-

12:02.720 --> 12:03.840
If the founding fathers-

12:04.800 --> 12:07.520
If the founding fathers left behind a magic horn

12:07.520 --> 12:08.800
that could summon the legends-

12:13.120 --> 12:15.360
If the founding fathers left behind a magic horn

12:15.360 --> 12:17.760
that could summon the legends of American history,

12:17.760 --> 12:19.680
would now be the time to blow it?

12:22.080 --> 12:24.720
Man, that's such a hard decision to make, you know?

12:24.720 --> 12:26.160
Because you only get to do it once.

12:26.880 --> 12:31.680
Yeah, I mean, they specifically inscribed that on the magic horn

12:31.680 --> 12:35.200
when they left it behind and buried it beneath the White House.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.640
But it goes on.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.920
If the founding fathers left behind a magic horn

12:39.920 --> 12:42.800
that could be blown in a time of dire need to save America

12:42.800 --> 12:44.000
but it would only work once-

12:44.000 --> 12:45.120
Thank you, Travis.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.040
Would now be the time to use it?

12:47.040 --> 12:47.760
They would stay-

12:52.240 --> 12:54.480
They would stay till the next new moon.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.920
All right, let's break this down.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.120
This continues on.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.560
The founding fathers could come back

13:02.560 --> 13:04.160
and solve the political problems.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.720
Great inventors like Edison and Tesla and Curie

13:06.720 --> 13:11.760
and Joe Salk, Jonas Salk and such

13:11.760 --> 13:15.200
could find a vaccine and a cure for the coronavirus.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.440
The inventors and scientists could work out something

13:17.440 --> 13:18.720
for saving the environment.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.920
It would be cool to see the great composers, musicians,

13:21.920 --> 13:24.000
and singers again who would bring us great music

13:24.000 --> 13:25.920
to inspire us through this crisis.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.480
Andrew's sisters could be back a while,

13:28.480 --> 13:30.240
just like they were in World War II.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.920
John Henry and Paul Bunyan could build us

13:31.920 --> 13:33.360
some new infrastructure.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.320
What is happening?

13:34.960 --> 13:37.280
Well, a blue magic horn brought back all American legends.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.080
Let me finish.

13:38.080 --> 13:38.720
Okay, no, wait.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.360
I'm confused, although I do want to dispute.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.960
Some of these are real human beings

13:42.960 --> 13:44.400
that invented fucking vaccines

13:44.400 --> 13:45.680
and some of them are Paul Bunyan.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.400
This is a good horn.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.640
I'm pretty sure-

13:52.640 --> 13:55.920
Okay, Marie Curie, I'm kind of sure.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.000
But Tesla, I know wasn't born here.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.400
I would not call them American legends.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.720
Maybe we know of them here.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.920
But it's not like-

14:03.920 --> 14:05.440
Can we claim Marie Curie?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.320
Is that ours?

14:06.320 --> 14:08.240
You gotta let me finish this.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.200
There's one last part here

14:09.200 --> 14:10.800
that is maybe the wildest one of all.

14:10.800 --> 14:17.280
It would likely conjure the armies of the past

14:17.280 --> 14:19.680
who could restore peace in the Middle East.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.280
Oh, I don't think that that's what

14:21.280 --> 14:23.040
they've been waiting on over there.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.320
I don't think they've been waiting on

14:24.320 --> 14:27.840
a bunch of old, tiny soldiers to show up

14:27.840 --> 14:31.280
in old, heavy, woolen garb

14:31.280 --> 14:32.800
with their muskets and what have you

14:32.800 --> 14:35.360
and been like, oh, that was it.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.720
That was the piece of the puzzle

14:36.720 --> 14:38.640
that's been missing the whole time.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.720
Final sentence, if there was such a magic horn

14:40.720 --> 14:42.080
would now be the time to use it.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.840
Well, okay, so I think a couple things

14:45.840 --> 14:48.800
we can kind of maybe poke holes in a little bit.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.960
Like, I think if Edison, Marie Curie,

14:53.760 --> 14:57.040
Jonas Salk, Tesla, if they came back now,

14:57.040 --> 15:00.400
I think they would have so much science to catch up on.

15:01.120 --> 15:04.240
Like, I don't think that they would be able

15:04.240 --> 15:06.640
to get to it by the next new moon, right?

15:06.640 --> 15:07.920
Because they'd come back and be like,

15:07.920 --> 15:09.520
whoa, let me see that iPhone.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.440
And you're like, yeah, but let's work on coronavirus.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.840
And they're like, give me a minute.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.880
Is that a TV?

15:14.880 --> 15:16.000
What the hell, right?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.640
Like, I don't think coronavirus,

15:18.640 --> 15:20.160
we're gonna get to that.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.200
You know what I mean?

15:21.200 --> 15:23.360
Well, they'd have to also jump through some hoops.

15:23.360 --> 15:26.800
Edison has fallen, I would say, greatly out of favor.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
Yeah, he's gonna be doing so,

15:28.800 --> 15:30.960
like his main first thing is gonna be

15:30.960 --> 15:32.160
just rebuilding the brand.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.040
Yeah, he has had it rough.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.880
Here's where we go, fucking Tesla, Marie Curie.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.840
They're like, what's up, what's up?

15:39.840 --> 15:42.080
People are like, oh, fuck yeah, cool, come on in.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.200
Edison's like, what's up?

15:43.200 --> 15:44.400
Your man, Edison's here too.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.760
Anybody need anything invented?

15:45.760 --> 15:47.760
And they'll be like, yo, tell us about this elephant

15:47.760 --> 15:49.920
that you shocked to death, partner.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.760
And he'd have to be like, oh, fuck,

15:51.760 --> 15:53.360
I think I can really whip this thing into,

15:53.360 --> 15:54.160
no, you're right.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.920
Okay, so listen, it was a different time.

15:56.880 --> 16:01.040
You have gone from like world renowned inventor father

16:01.040 --> 16:05.840
of like the electric light to literal Dr. Who villain

16:05.840 --> 16:08.640
in a literal episode of Dr. Who, my man.

16:08.640 --> 16:11.120
I know it's been rough since you kind of checked out

16:11.120 --> 16:13.920
with the dying, but things have not gone well for you

16:13.920 --> 16:14.880
in the interim.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.840
You should have left a very sympathetic like memoir

16:17.840 --> 16:18.880
or something.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.800
And can you imagine when Paul Bunyan comes back

16:20.800 --> 16:22.960
and you're like, let's get to work on this infrastructure.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.440
How about some kind of universal wifi?

16:25.440 --> 16:26.560
And he's like, what?

16:26.560 --> 16:27.440
What are you talking about?

16:27.440 --> 16:29.280
I can take a new Grand Canyon.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.920
You're like, no, we need highways, we need restructure

16:31.920 --> 16:32.400
bridges.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.440
Oh, I don't do that.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.600
In my mindscape, I have thought of a deeper hole

16:37.600 --> 16:38.960
we can poo poo and pee in.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.960
John Henry, we're gonna need you to do some kind

16:42.960 --> 16:44.640
of light rail system.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.000
No, I'm a steel driving man.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.000
I don't know anything about that.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.360
You have 24 hours to learn all about electromagnets

16:55.360 --> 16:57.120
or else we're gonna blow the fucking horn again.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.720
Okay, oh no, you'll send me back to hell.

17:02.080 --> 17:02.800
What?

17:02.800 --> 17:03.840
All of them are in hell.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.440
They're all in hell.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.480
Okay, wow.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.520
Even Jonas Salk created the polio vaccine.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.480
That's a tough break, Jonas.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.600
Sorry, hey, you gave it away for free and refused

17:15.600 --> 17:18.160
to patent your vaccine, but you're in hell?

17:18.160 --> 17:20.640
Yep, you don't know what other stuff he was into.

17:21.760 --> 17:22.320
You know what?

17:23.040 --> 17:25.520
That's a tough way to counterbalance that, Trav.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.160
I mean, not my works are you saved.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.160
I do get that, for sure.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.360
All right, let's put this out there right now.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.440
The next new moon is gonna come April 22nd.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.880
So right now, sort of chronologically speaking,

17:40.880 --> 17:42.640
is not the best time to blow this horn.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.520
No, no, no, no.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.160
April 23rd, we blow this horn, we get the maximum

17:48.160 --> 17:50.480
amount of time with these American legends.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.840
But here's the problem, Griffin.

17:51.840 --> 17:52.800
What if-

17:52.800 --> 17:53.760
There's a problem?

17:53.760 --> 17:58.720
Yes, between now and the 22nd is when it's the exact

17:58.720 --> 18:01.120
moment we most needed them, right?

18:01.120 --> 18:05.200
So we might not, it might be quality over quantity, right?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.520
Like we would only have 10 days with them,

18:07.520 --> 18:10.400
but in that 10 days is when we needed them most.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.240
Well, I would argue that we should have fucking

18:12.240 --> 18:15.600
blown this horn on what, February or March 22nd?

18:15.600 --> 18:18.080
Yeah, Griffin, yeah, duh.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.960
But we just found the horn, didn't we?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.320
We just found it.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.400
We were repainting that one bathroom,

18:24.400 --> 18:26.640
and we peeled off the wallpaper,

18:26.640 --> 18:27.920
and there was a little door there,

18:28.480 --> 18:29.520
and we just never looked.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.000
I think-

18:32.000 --> 18:32.880
We never looked.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.560
What do you think the founding fathers,

18:34.560 --> 18:37.120
like if John Adams came back now and like fixed

18:37.120 --> 18:38.720
the American government, he'd be like,

18:38.720 --> 18:40.960
ooh, I don't fucking know, man.

18:40.960 --> 18:41.440
I don't know.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.160
And it's like, oh, okay, and he's like,

18:44.160 --> 18:47.840
so I got like what, 27 days left?

18:47.840 --> 18:50.640
I'm just gonna go, well, I can't go outside, huh?

18:50.640 --> 18:52.560
Because you guys fucked that up.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.280
Ooh.

18:53.280 --> 18:53.680
Sorry.

18:54.480 --> 18:59.600
I'm pretty sure that like their shit aged pretty bad also.

18:59.600 --> 19:03.440
Pretty sure by the time Bill Wright came out,

19:03.440 --> 19:05.920
that most of them were like, oh, man,

19:06.480 --> 19:09.280
we fucking beefed it pretty bad on that one, huh?

19:09.280 --> 19:11.040
The whole foundational shit.

19:11.040 --> 19:11.920
Ah, beans.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.160
I don't think that's gotten better since, what?

19:14.160 --> 19:14.960
Why didn't we put-

19:14.960 --> 19:17.120
We should have put no scrubs into the Constitution.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.160
Yeah, damn it.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.200
Should have just written no scrubs.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.800
Ben Franklin's like, I know, right?

19:20.800 --> 19:21.760
That's what I said.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.280
I said that.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.880
And you said, but what about him?

19:24.880 --> 19:25.600
He's a scrub.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.720
And I said, no scrubs.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.560
Do you have to play a song on the magic horn

19:30.560 --> 19:34.080
or is it just, is it sort of like one of those long

19:34.080 --> 19:35.840
Ricola horns that you just kind of like

19:35.840 --> 19:37.440
emit a deep blow from?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.280
And then do they come out of the horn?

19:40.240 --> 19:40.560
Huh?

19:40.560 --> 19:41.920
No, I think it just summons it.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.760
You blow it, knock, knock, knock.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.360
Hey, you needed us?

19:45.360 --> 19:48.640
Like, it would be weird if they sprung fully formed.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.320
How big is the horn though, I guess?

19:50.320 --> 19:52.400
Because if the horn is like gigantic

19:52.400 --> 19:54.960
and we found it like in, you know, I don't know,

19:54.960 --> 19:56.960
a desert or something, that's pretty cool.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.960
But if it's just like a handheld number,

19:58.960 --> 20:01.280
I don't want to see human beings come out of it.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.600
I bet fucking Alexander Hamilton

20:03.600 --> 20:05.760
would be pretty psyched about everything though, huh?

20:05.760 --> 20:07.920
Yeah, he'd probably enjoy it.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.600
He'd probably come out with all this stuff.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.520
He'd be like, how's the money stuff?

20:11.520 --> 20:12.480
Not good, not good?

20:12.480 --> 20:13.920
I'll do what I can, but hold on.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.040
First, let me enjoy this moment.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.720
I can actually, it would be a little,

20:18.720 --> 20:21.600
that would be kind of, I think that would be difficult.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.680
Cause it's like, they did a whole musical about me.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.280
Yeah, how do people feel about it?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.560
They fucking love it.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.840
Oh yeah, can I go see it?

20:27.840 --> 20:29.440
You cannot, nope, that I cannot.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.800
I am so sorry about this, but you cannot do that.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.280
I can't.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.320
Well, soon, right though, before the next new moon, right?

20:36.320 --> 20:37.120
Ooh.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.520
This is challenging.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.600
I can't wait to see the end when I shoot Aaron Burr

20:41.600 --> 20:44.720
right in his fucking head and waste that dude, right?

20:44.720 --> 20:46.000
That's how it happened, right?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.200
That's how it happened, right?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.240
Did I waste him?

20:48.240 --> 20:49.840
I sure hope I did, right?

20:49.840 --> 20:50.880
God, it's been so long.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.760
Real quick, you guys.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.480
Yeah, please.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.920
Now that everyone's stuck at home,

20:55.920 --> 20:58.080
I thought that this would be a really good time.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.240
Oh no, he's about to do something bad, isn't he?

21:00.240 --> 21:01.040
Hi, everybody.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.960
I was just about to give a quiz to my brothers.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.480
So I thought it was a good time for you all

21:04.480 --> 21:05.920
to play along at home.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.480
Yes, yes.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.120
Yeah, you know what?

21:09.120 --> 21:10.080
Actually, I like it now.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.200
Oh, good.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.800
Now I've tried something new here

21:12.800 --> 21:15.360
rather than one question for both of you.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.720
Travis, the format was not broken, pal.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.200
You would-

21:19.200 --> 21:20.960
I have written multiple questions,

21:20.960 --> 21:23.520
but so three questions for Justin

21:24.080 --> 21:25.680
and three questions for Griffin.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.080
Holy Christ, that's got a lot of questions.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.520
But only Justin is allowed to answer Justin's questions

21:31.520 --> 21:33.600
and only Griffin is allowed to answer Griffin's questions,

21:33.600 --> 21:36.560
but everyone at home is welcome to play along

21:36.560 --> 21:37.440
on all the questions.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.160
So let's begin.

21:38.960 --> 21:43.680
Justin, of the original 150,

21:43.680 --> 21:47.200
please name the three ghost type Pokemon.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.400
It's easy shit.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.640
Gastly.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.680
Uh-huh, that's one.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.320
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:58.320 --> 21:58.880
Oh, no.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.560
Gastly.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.520
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin.

22:03.520 --> 22:04.000
Time's up.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.120
Griffin, do you want to-

22:05.120 --> 22:06.640
Fucking Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.680
And technically, and technically,

22:09.680 --> 22:12.400
that one Marowak that was Cubone's mom

22:12.400 --> 22:15.360
that was dead as hell at the top of the tower.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.880
Now, Griffin, at Disneyland,

22:21.600 --> 22:25.680
which animal is given free reign to roam the park at night?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.080
What animal?

22:28.080 --> 22:28.640
A horse.

22:29.920 --> 22:30.480
No, I'm sorry.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.560
The answer is feral cats.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.920
There's estimated to be over 200 feral cats

22:35.920 --> 22:37.520
that roam the grounds of Disneyland at night.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.280
Well, they should do something about that.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.480
Disneyland sucks.

22:40.480 --> 22:40.980
Sucks.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.040
Is that why you did this?

22:43.040 --> 22:44.720
To give me an opportunity to say Disneyland sucks.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.280
Oh, really?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.960
You're Disney World, man.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.400
Only.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.520
Yeah, Disneyland is-

22:51.360 --> 22:54.080
It's pretty good if you can get past the feral cats.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.200
I heard it's not even open.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.880
So, Justin.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.600
Yeah, I bet they're having a fucking heyday, by the way.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.240
200 feral cats, you mean 2,000.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.360
The gates are open.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.120
Everything's made of feral cats.

23:07.760 --> 23:08.320
Justin.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.240
Currently, Eevee has eight possible evolutions.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.840
Please name at least five.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.040
Eevee, possible evolutions.

23:19.040 --> 23:19.920
I mean-

23:19.920 --> 23:20.800
Are you Googling?

23:21.440 --> 23:24.080
No, I'm not Googling, which you'll know because I won't.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.320
Eevee, eight?

23:26.880 --> 23:28.640
Eight seems like so many, right?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.480
Yeah, seems like a lot.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.680
It's a lot to keep track of.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.680
I wanted to say clay fairy for the last one,

23:37.680 --> 23:38.880
so I'm gonna say clay fairy again.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.800
No, God, come on.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.320
Eevee, two?

23:44.320 --> 23:46.240
They all end in eon.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.000
Griffin, how many can you name?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.680
Radion, is that one?

23:49.680 --> 23:50.960
God damn it.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.400
How many can you name, Griffin?

23:52.400 --> 23:55.680
Well, you got Jolteon, Flareon, and Vaporeon from Gen 1,

23:55.680 --> 23:58.560
and I think that's when they added Espeon and Umbreon,

23:58.560 --> 24:00.160
which are the psychic and dark type.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.120
You do have Leafeon and Glaceon, which is ice,

24:03.120 --> 24:05.520
and the fairy type one is Sylveon?

24:05.520 --> 24:07.920
Damn, that's all eight right there.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.320
You guys want me to know?

24:10.320 --> 24:11.440
It's eight Pokemon.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.280
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:13.280 --> 24:14.960
It's eight Pokemon.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.720
Griffin, and if you get anywhere close to the number,

24:18.720 --> 24:19.920
I will count it as correct.

24:20.480 --> 24:24.640
But how many churros are sold at Disneyland every year?

24:25.600 --> 24:26.160
A billion.

24:27.520 --> 24:30.160
Jesus, no, over 2.8 million.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.000
That's a lot of churros, though, huh?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.600
That's quite a lot of churros.

24:33.600 --> 24:37.280
Sorry, I'm just trying to answer these as quickly as possible.

24:37.280 --> 24:37.760
I appreciate that.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.920
I could sooner answer, by the way,

24:39.920 --> 24:42.160
questions about Pokemon than I could about Disneyland.

24:42.160 --> 24:42.640
Oh, really?

24:42.640 --> 24:44.960
With that bad theme park that no one enjoys.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.400
Next week, I'll make them on Disney World.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.400
Or don't do it next week.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.200
Let's not.

24:49.200 --> 24:55.120
Justin, Pikachu's name is a Japanese onomatopoeia portmanteau

24:55.120 --> 24:56.560
for what two words?

24:57.360 --> 25:03.120
Pikachu's name is a Japanese onomatopoeia portmanteau

25:03.120 --> 25:04.400
for what two words?

25:05.840 --> 25:12.320
It is a portmanteau of two onomatopoetical words, I guess.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.400
Two onomatopoetical English words?

25:15.280 --> 25:15.520
No.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.200
Okay, so just...

25:17.200 --> 25:18.400
No, no problem.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.520
Yeah, let me just dip in my knowledge of Pokemon and Japanese

25:22.160 --> 25:23.680
to come up with...

25:28.160 --> 25:29.920
I always thought it was like, peek at you.

25:30.960 --> 25:31.460
Okay.

25:31.460 --> 25:35.060
So, like, you know how he's a dirty perv.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.060
Like, he's a dirty perv when he peeks at you.

25:37.060 --> 25:37.780
I Pikachu.

25:38.340 --> 25:39.140
It's actually...

25:39.140 --> 25:39.700
Oh, let me get a...

25:41.540 --> 25:42.260
Okay.

25:42.260 --> 25:44.980
I mean, Choo Choo Rocket is about a mouse,

25:44.980 --> 25:47.780
so I think Choo is the onomatopoetic noise that a mouse makes.

25:48.420 --> 25:48.660
Okay.

25:48.660 --> 25:53.300
Which would mean that Pika is the sound that electricity makes.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.500
Well, hey, you know what?

25:54.500 --> 25:55.060
I'll count it.

25:55.060 --> 25:58.580
Because Choo Choo is squeaking and Pika Pika is sparkle.

25:58.580 --> 26:02.100
So Pikachu is sparkle and squeaking.

26:02.100 --> 26:02.600
Okay.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.500
Griffin, one last question.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.460
What doesn't he know?

26:05.460 --> 26:06.180
Who said that?

26:06.820 --> 26:10.020
When Pirates of the Caribbean originally opened at Disneyland,

26:10.020 --> 26:13.780
what authentic props were used on loan from UCLA?

26:13.780 --> 26:14.280
Guns.

26:15.620 --> 26:16.100
Incorrect.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.620
The answer is human skeletons.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.100
Oh, they shouldn't have done that.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.340
No, not at all.

26:22.340 --> 26:25.860
That seems horribly, like, morally seeking, right?

26:25.860 --> 26:27.700
Yeah, they shouldn't have used those.

26:27.700 --> 26:30.020
Those are real dead, real deads.

26:30.020 --> 26:33.380
And hey, just FYI, those were all returned,

26:33.380 --> 26:36.260
but there is still, according to the thing I read,

26:36.260 --> 26:40.020
one human skull still in use at Pirates of the Caribbean and Disneyland.

26:40.020 --> 26:43.940
So, guess times, they haven't changed that much.

26:45.700 --> 26:46.740
So who won?

26:46.740 --> 26:48.020
That would be, well, I guess-

26:48.020 --> 26:49.860
I fucking stomped your ass, dude.

26:49.860 --> 26:52.660
Well, Griffin at least knew the answers to your questions.

26:52.660 --> 26:53.300
That's true.

26:54.100 --> 26:54.580
Oh, well.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.660
Hey, we'll get him next time.

26:56.660 --> 26:58.980
But thank you, Travis, for that great segment.

26:58.980 --> 27:00.100
I think we all had a lot of fun.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.180
It was a nice break from humor.

27:03.060 --> 27:07.780
Let's take a break and head on over to the Money Zone.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.620
I want to tell you about Blue Apron.

27:20.260 --> 27:23.380
Because I know that neither one of you have ever heard about it before.

27:23.380 --> 27:23.860
Get this.

27:23.860 --> 27:26.820
This, imagine being able to cook food at home,

27:27.460 --> 27:30.420
but without having to go anywhere to buy that food first.

27:32.340 --> 27:35.700
Blue Apron sends you a box full of ingredients.

27:35.700 --> 27:37.620
Just random ingredients, you ask?

27:37.620 --> 27:41.700
No, specific ingredients to make specific meals

27:41.700 --> 27:45.060
that they also give you instructions on how to cook.

27:45.060 --> 27:47.620
It's just that simple.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.980
And I know what you're asking.

27:48.980 --> 27:51.940
Is it the same three meals every time?

27:51.940 --> 27:52.260
No.

27:52.260 --> 27:53.940
Yes, hamburgers, spaghetti.

27:53.940 --> 27:54.180
No.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.940
No, it's different meals each time.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.980
And you can choose what kind of meals you want.

28:00.980 --> 28:05.540
And these are chef-designed, delicious, ready-to-cook meals

28:05.540 --> 28:07.140
with perfectly portioned ingredients

28:07.140 --> 28:08.660
and a lot of flavorful options.

28:08.660 --> 28:13.220
And it's also near your door, starting as low as $7.49 per serving.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.100
And it's flexible.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.180
You can skip weeks or cancel any time.

28:16.180 --> 28:18.820
Feel good about your food and your environment impact

28:18.820 --> 28:21.140
with Blue Apron, the first and only meal kit

28:21.140 --> 28:22.820
to partner with How To Recycle,

28:22.820 --> 28:24.580
which takes the guesswork out of recycling

28:24.580 --> 28:27.140
and is committed to transparency and reducing waste.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.900
Find comfort in the kitchen with Blue Apron

28:28.900 --> 28:31.220
and enjoy delicious home-cooked meal.

28:31.220 --> 28:34.260
Check out this week's menu and visit BlueApron.com.

28:34.260 --> 28:36.580
That's BlueApron.com.

28:36.580 --> 28:38.980
Blue Apron, eat your soul.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.260
No, feed your soul, excuse me.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.060
Eat your own soul.

28:45.220 --> 28:47.780
You think Shang Tsung ever accidentally ate his own soul?

28:48.580 --> 28:50.260
He was like, oh, crap.

28:50.260 --> 28:52.580
Probably when he was young, right, and first doing it.

28:52.580 --> 28:52.820
Yeah.

28:52.820 --> 28:54.980
Or he was like, kind of like this, like, no.

28:56.340 --> 28:59.940
And he maybe, well, then is it still in your tummy then?

29:01.060 --> 29:02.740
Well, the soul lives in the tummy.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.700
And as you ponder that, also ponder about Stitch Fix.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.660
It is a box that is also gonna come to your door.

29:09.300 --> 29:12.500
And can you build a robot costume out of these boxes?

29:12.500 --> 29:12.820
Sure.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.380
Nobody's gonna stop you from doing that.

29:15.380 --> 29:19.860
But there's other clothes too that come in these Stitch Fix boxes.

29:19.860 --> 29:24.260
It's a personal styling company that makes getting the clothes you love effortless.

29:24.260 --> 29:31.940
You send a box of clothes that is set up for you via the Stitch Fix profile service.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.740
You punch in, like, what kind of stuff you like to wear.

29:34.740 --> 29:38.660
And you work with an online stylist who will then send you clothes.

29:38.660 --> 29:41.620
And whatever you like, you keep and you pay for it.

29:41.620 --> 29:42.900
Everything else you just ship back.

29:42.900 --> 29:46.900
And returns and shipping and exchanges are always easy and free.

29:46.900 --> 29:50.980
You just pay a $20 styling fee for each fix that gets sent to you.

29:50.980 --> 29:53.060
And it's credited towards anything that you keep.

29:53.060 --> 29:54.500
So get started today at stitchfix.com.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.460
Griffin, hold on.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.900
What if I like to wear clothes that are dumb and ugly and uncomfortable?

29:58.900 --> 30:00.100
Will they send me some of those?

30:00.900 --> 30:03.300
I mean, if you ask for it, I don't know.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.780
Hey, Stitch Fix, give me dumb poopy clothes.

30:05.780 --> 30:07.140
Give me the dutiest stuff you got.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.300
They have never sent me poopy clothes ever.

30:09.300 --> 30:10.500
They've only sent me good stuff.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.620
And I really like it.

30:11.620 --> 30:14.340

Stitch Fix, wear your soul.

30:30.820 --> 30:31.940
Hi, I'm Dave.

30:31.940 --> 30:32.900
Hi, I'm Graham.

30:32.900 --> 30:37.620
And we're two house DJs who have been trapped inside our drum machine.

30:37.620 --> 30:38.340
We love it here.

30:38.340 --> 30:41.860
And we'd love if you stopped by and visited us every week.

30:41.860 --> 30:43.620
On Stop Podcasting Yourself.

30:43.620 --> 30:45.860
Here on MaximumFun.org.

30:45.860 --> 30:48.820
We're just a couple of doofuses from Canada.

30:48.820 --> 30:50.900
And listen to our show or perish.

30:52.420 --> 30:57.060
Stop podcasting yourself on MaximumFun.org.

31:04.820 --> 31:06.980
I got another question from a listener.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.500
Every time I video conference with my co-workers,

31:10.500 --> 31:13.140
they comment about the mirror on the wall behind me.

31:13.140 --> 31:16.100
I like having the mirror there since it makes the room look bigger.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.060
But my co-workers comments are starting to get annoying.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.900
What should I do to hide that mirror

31:20.900 --> 31:23.460
that won't start more conversations about the dang mirror?

31:24.020 --> 31:25.540
And that's from the man in the mirror.

31:27.140 --> 31:28.100
I have no idea.

31:28.820 --> 31:29.540
Oh, yeah.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.220
Like how do you move them?

31:31.220 --> 31:32.820
Like how do you move a mirror?

31:32.820 --> 31:34.420
What do you do with it?

31:34.420 --> 31:35.300
Throw it in the garbage?

31:35.300 --> 31:36.020
You break it?

31:36.020 --> 31:37.460
No, there's nothing to be done.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.980
I'm gonna have to call in some outside help.

31:40.980 --> 31:44.740
You know, Elizabeth Gilbert's an author,

31:44.740 --> 31:46.260
so she's probably just at home.

31:46.820 --> 31:47.780
And she's strong.

31:47.780 --> 31:48.820
Strong enough to move mirrors.

31:48.820 --> 31:49.860
Strong enough to move mirrors.

31:49.860 --> 31:50.980
Let me call her.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.340
Elizabeth, I haven't called you yet.

31:53.300 --> 31:54.660
Okay, let me call her real quick.

31:54.660 --> 31:56.260
Bloop, bloop, blop, bloop, bloop.

31:58.900 --> 31:59.620
Banana phone.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.540
Hi, hi, hi, this is Liz.

32:01.540 --> 32:04.180
Liz, hey, it's Justin and Travis and Griffin.

32:04.180 --> 32:06.980
Oh, I didn't see your name come up on my ID.

32:06.980 --> 32:08.340
That's incredible.

32:08.340 --> 32:09.780
Yeah, you should get your phone fixed.

32:09.780 --> 32:10.740
It's broken.

32:10.740 --> 32:12.420
Yeah, it may be kind of messed up

32:12.420 --> 32:13.620
because I think your phone number

32:13.620 --> 32:15.140
does only have five numbers in it.

32:17.140 --> 32:18.580
Just happened to be walking by the phone.

32:18.580 --> 32:20.180
Just a delight to hear you.

32:20.820 --> 32:22.900
I have her on my speed dial actually,

32:22.900 --> 32:24.820
but she's in the 20,000s,

32:24.820 --> 32:28.580
so it does take five button presses to get there.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.180
Let me text you the question

32:30.180 --> 32:31.860
so I don't have to read it again.

32:31.860 --> 32:32.820
Yep, yep.

32:32.820 --> 32:33.460
Got it?

32:33.460 --> 32:34.260
Okay.

32:34.260 --> 32:36.100
And Justin, what would that sound like?

32:36.100 --> 32:38.180
Let me take you inside the vent for that.

32:38.180 --> 32:39.540
Do some prop work.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.820
Come on, anchor us.

32:40.820 --> 32:41.860
Okay, I'll do it.

32:41.860 --> 32:45.380
Hey Siri, text Elizabeth Gilbert.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.700
Which Elizabeth Gilbert?

32:47.700 --> 32:48.740
The only one in my phone.

32:50.420 --> 32:53.620
Every time I video conference with my coworkers,

32:53.620 --> 32:56.020
they comment about the mirror on the wall behind me.

32:56.020 --> 32:58.100
I like having the mirror there since it,

32:58.820 --> 33:01.300
no, I like having the mirror there.

33:02.340 --> 33:04.740
Delete, delete, delete.

33:05.540 --> 33:06.180
Okay, start up.

33:06.180 --> 33:10.180
Siri, text Liz Gilbert.

33:10.180 --> 33:12.420
Every time I video conference with my,

33:12.420 --> 33:13.540
oh, it auto completed.

33:13.540 --> 33:16.260
Okay, it auto completed with the entire rest of the question.

33:16.260 --> 33:16.740
Perfect.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.180
Okay, so there it is.

33:18.180 --> 33:19.140
You should have it.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.780
Liz, you're about to get like that exact text

33:21.780 --> 33:23.860
from hundreds of thousands of our listeners

33:23.860 --> 33:25.940
by the way, just because of the way that Apple's technology works.

33:25.940 --> 33:27.060
It's weird, it came through,

33:27.060 --> 33:32.580
but it came through as like a GoFundMe directly to you guys.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.900
So I don't know what that is, but yeah.

33:34.900 --> 33:36.500
Well, these are trying times, Liz.

33:38.180 --> 33:42.260
I really like the sort of cyclical nature

33:42.260 --> 33:45.940
of this question being pitched to Liz Gilbert

33:45.940 --> 33:47.780
because the last time you were on the show,

33:48.820 --> 33:51.140
400,000 years ago.

33:51.140 --> 33:51.940
Many years ago.

33:52.500 --> 33:57.380
You dished out some truly helpful

33:57.380 --> 34:00.340
and I would say genuinely life-changing advice

34:00.340 --> 34:02.180
about working from home and taking it seriously

34:02.180 --> 34:04.180
and putting on clean pants every morning.

34:04.180 --> 34:07.700
And here we are now 400,000 years later

34:07.700 --> 34:10.260
in the grips of some, let's say nasty stuff.

34:11.940 --> 34:14.900
And technology has changed.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.500
Now we got video conferencing

34:16.500 --> 34:18.580
and we got to worry about mirrors and stuff.

34:18.580 --> 34:22.420
It's just, it's like a beautiful bookend.

34:22.420 --> 34:23.460
You know what I mean?

34:23.460 --> 34:26.020
And yet some things haven't changed, you know?

34:26.900 --> 34:28.580
And one of the things that hasn't changed

34:28.580 --> 34:31.860
and I think that I would say you guys would agree with me on this

34:31.860 --> 34:34.580
is that people should be themselves still.

34:35.140 --> 34:38.340
So this question asker is saying,

34:38.340 --> 34:39.620
how can I hide my mirror?

34:39.620 --> 34:41.140
Which sounds to me a lot like,

34:41.140 --> 34:42.980
how can I hide my light under a bushel?

34:43.940 --> 34:46.500
And we don't support that, right?

34:46.500 --> 34:48.180
We want you to show your mirror.

34:48.740 --> 34:51.140
If I may, and this is gonna go against,

34:51.140 --> 34:53.300
I would say your entire aesthetic,

34:54.020 --> 34:58.260
but maybe people shouldn't always 100% be themselves, right?

34:58.260 --> 35:03.060
Like there's something, you know what I mean?

35:03.060 --> 35:05.620
Like maybe hold 1% back isn't the worst.

35:05.620 --> 35:10.020
You remember in Elizabeth's novel,

35:10.020 --> 35:12.980
Eat, Pray, Love, the woman learns the lesson

35:12.980 --> 35:14.900
which is on the back page and the front page

35:14.900 --> 35:17.140
is be yourself within reason.

35:18.820 --> 35:20.100
Unless other people are looking.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.060
Unless other, yeah.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.500
Dance like people that you sort of care about watching

35:24.500 --> 35:25.700
are in fact watching you dance.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.940
Dance like your coworkers are watching you.

35:27.940 --> 35:29.700
Right, dance like your coworkers

35:29.700 --> 35:32.740
who you've built up a kind of facade personality for

35:32.740 --> 35:33.620
are watching.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.140
You've seen them dance.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.100
So like keep that in mind as you dance for them.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.540
But I have two thoughts on this.

35:39.540 --> 35:42.340
One is that I think you should write something

35:42.340 --> 35:43.540
on the mirror backwards.

35:45.060 --> 35:45.940
That's good.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.860
And just not even make mention of it

35:47.860 --> 35:49.620
and then pretend that you can't see it, right?

35:49.620 --> 35:50.740
So you could just send,

35:50.740 --> 35:53.140
have very dark satanic messages on the mirror.

35:53.860 --> 35:54.900
Or happy ones.

35:54.900 --> 35:59.060
Yeah, it could be a happy satanic message.

35:59.060 --> 36:00.500
Hey, it's me, Satan.

36:00.500 --> 36:01.380
Be safe out there.

36:01.380 --> 36:02.580
Wash your hands.

36:02.580 --> 36:04.900
What if you put their questions about the mirror

36:04.900 --> 36:07.700
on the mirror, right?

36:07.700 --> 36:09.060
Doug asks, you know,

36:09.060 --> 36:10.740
and you just have it be like a whiteboard.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.780
Could you paint a small child

36:13.780 --> 36:15.540
in prison inside, really?

36:16.100 --> 36:16.420
I'm home.

36:16.420 --> 36:17.620
Can I take it one step further?

36:17.620 --> 36:19.780
Cause my idea was to like,

36:19.780 --> 36:21.700
I think if we combine that and my idea

36:21.700 --> 36:23.700
which is to do that and then cover it

36:23.700 --> 36:25.220
with some kind of black lace.

36:26.340 --> 36:27.700
Oh, very nice.

36:27.700 --> 36:30.180
So if I remove this,

36:30.180 --> 36:32.180
no, you guys don't want to see the mirror anymore.

36:32.180 --> 36:33.060
Trust me.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.500
Yeah, cause you'll trade places

36:34.500 --> 36:36.020
with whoever you see in there.

36:36.020 --> 36:39.060
And then they're gonna take over this meeting

36:39.060 --> 36:42.740
and they're gonna waste a lot of company time.

36:42.740 --> 36:43.060
Yeah.

36:43.060 --> 36:47.780
Could you make some sort of optical illusion

36:47.780 --> 36:49.220
with your camera on your phone

36:49.220 --> 36:50.980
or on your laptop or whatever you're using?

36:50.980 --> 36:52.900
So when they complain about the mirror,

36:52.900 --> 36:53.780
they mention the mirror,

36:53.780 --> 36:55.540
you go, okay, you guys, I hear you.

36:55.540 --> 36:56.340
I'm gonna move it now.

36:56.980 --> 36:58.100
But when you go to move it,

36:58.100 --> 36:59.860
your reflection doesn't show up in it.

36:59.860 --> 37:02.820
Oh, there's gotta be some,

37:02.820 --> 37:04.980
somebody, we'll get the top people on that

37:04.980 --> 37:06.260
and see if we can't.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.500
Hey, let's call David Blaine.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.940
Someone get David Blaine on the phone.

37:09.940 --> 37:10.660
Let me call him too.

37:12.660 --> 37:13.940
Hey, it's me, David Blaine.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.620
I'm not done calling you, David Blaine.

37:15.620 --> 37:16.740
Oh, but I'm here to help.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.460
Hey, I knew you were gonna call.

37:19.460 --> 37:20.820
That's the magic trick.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.660
Look inside the bottle.

37:22.660 --> 37:23.940
That's where the mirror is now.

37:24.580 --> 37:26.580
Hey, Liz, if I may call you Liz,

37:26.580 --> 37:28.820
let me hit you with this.

37:28.820 --> 37:31.460
What if you've crafted a lot of drama?

37:31.460 --> 37:33.300
What do you think about the drama of this moment?

37:33.940 --> 37:35.780
The next time your employee

37:35.780 --> 37:38.420
or your coworkers mention the mirror

37:38.420 --> 37:39.860
without missing a beat,

37:39.860 --> 37:42.340
you pick up an ashtray that you have

37:42.340 --> 37:43.380
there on your desk

37:43.380 --> 37:44.660
and chuck it out the mirror

37:44.660 --> 37:45.700
and smash it into a million pieces.

37:45.700 --> 37:47.780
Oh, it's so good.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.460
After that moment, right?

37:49.460 --> 37:55.380
You are someone who is capable of anything.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.700
And don't even respond beyond that.

37:58.260 --> 37:58.500
Yeah.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.140
Like, you're right back in that Zoom window

38:01.860 --> 38:03.460
and you're just like,

38:03.460 --> 38:05.940
you know, I've got the quarterly reports here now for Dan

38:06.580 --> 38:09.220
and people will be more...

38:09.220 --> 38:11.060
That's more terrifying than if your reflection

38:11.060 --> 38:11.620
doesn't show up.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.180
I bet.

38:12.180 --> 38:13.860
There's one thing they're not gonna do again

38:13.860 --> 38:15.380
and that's trifle with you.

38:15.380 --> 38:16.820
There will be no trifling.

38:16.820 --> 38:19.460
They also won't complain about the mirror anymore

38:19.460 --> 38:20.500
because it will be described.

38:20.500 --> 38:20.980
It's gone.

38:22.020 --> 38:23.140
I would like to pitch something

38:24.500 --> 38:26.100
along the lines of the optical illusion.

38:26.100 --> 38:26.900
You made me think of this.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.900
What if before the next meeting

38:28.900 --> 38:30.420
you cut a hole in the wall,

38:31.140 --> 38:32.580
the exact size of the mirror,

38:32.580 --> 38:34.340
and then you put the mirror frame up

38:34.340 --> 38:35.460
without the mirror in it

38:35.460 --> 38:36.820
and then behind that hole

38:36.820 --> 38:38.020
on the other side of the wall,

38:38.020 --> 38:39.620
you put a mirror, right?

38:39.620 --> 38:40.900
So it looks like it's reflecting

38:40.900 --> 38:42.580
and the next time someone mentions the mirror,

38:42.580 --> 38:43.940
you say, I've had enough of this

38:43.940 --> 38:46.420
and then you step into the mirror world

38:46.420 --> 38:46.820
and do the mirror.

38:46.820 --> 38:49.460
The amazing thing that you just did, Travis,

38:49.460 --> 38:50.900
is that sentence itself

38:50.900 --> 38:53.060
sounded like a mirror reflected in a mirror.

38:53.060 --> 38:53.620
Thank you.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.140
I just got lost in there, like,

38:57.140 --> 38:59.620
bouncing from the image to image.

38:59.620 --> 39:01.140
But if you go back and track it,

39:01.140 --> 39:02.260
it all makes sense.

39:02.260 --> 39:03.540
It diagrams perfectly.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.620
Someone has an absolutely banal problem

39:05.620 --> 39:07.700
and Travis decides to build Pepper's ghost

39:08.340 --> 39:08.820
behind them.

39:10.820 --> 39:11.700
I think this is fun.

39:11.700 --> 39:12.980
I think because, listen,

39:12.980 --> 39:15.460
we could be in this mess for quite a while.

39:15.460 --> 39:17.540
What I love about having a solution

39:17.540 --> 39:19.700
is you can build on it every week.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.460
Maybe the first week you go in and come out,

39:21.460 --> 39:22.260
you're like, oh, that's weird.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.700
Everything's in there, but it's backwards.

39:23.700 --> 39:24.340
And the second week,

39:24.340 --> 39:26.340
maybe you come out with a glowing orb.

39:26.340 --> 39:28.660
And you're like, yo, this mirror world

39:28.660 --> 39:30.260
is what I want you to build up.

39:30.260 --> 39:32.980
I want you to make it as difficult as possible

39:32.980 --> 39:35.060
for your coworkers to reconcile

39:35.060 --> 39:36.500
your at-home fiction

39:36.500 --> 39:38.740
with your in-the-office fiction

39:38.740 --> 39:40.580
once you are headed back to the office.

39:40.580 --> 39:41.780
Like, once you get back to the office,

39:41.780 --> 39:43.060
do not mention the mirror world.

39:43.060 --> 39:44.100
Do not mention the orb.

39:44.100 --> 39:46.420
Don't be like, yo, we saw some wild shit

39:46.420 --> 39:47.620
when we were talking to you on Zoom.

39:47.620 --> 39:48.500
Are you okay?

39:48.500 --> 39:50.420
I have no idea what you're talking about.

39:50.420 --> 39:53.780
If you've got a friend among your coworkers,

39:53.780 --> 39:55.460
if you could coordinate it with somehow

39:55.460 --> 39:57.140
where you could send them a film

39:57.140 --> 39:59.300
so that you appear to be walking through the mirror

39:59.300 --> 40:00.660
and coming out into their home.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.460
And then you're like, right?

40:05.460 --> 40:07.540
Even worth risking COVID-19,

40:07.540 --> 40:10.260
I think, to actually go film that at your house.

40:10.260 --> 40:11.300
Let's be clear.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.820
You're going to be fired

40:12.820 --> 40:14.340
because your boss is going to put together

40:14.340 --> 40:17.940
how much time and effort you've put into this

40:17.940 --> 40:20.100
instead of, I don't know, reports or whatever, right?

40:20.100 --> 40:21.300
You're going to lose your job,

40:21.300 --> 40:23.620
but you're going to be a legend.

40:23.620 --> 40:24.900
Yeah, I think that's good.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.100
I've never had a job,

40:26.100 --> 40:29.300
so I don't know how these things work.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.060
Now, that's not true, Elizabeth Gilbert.

40:31.060 --> 40:31.700
You do have a job.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.180
You're an author, and you just published.

40:34.180 --> 40:35.300
Well, you didn't publish.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.820
I'm assuming you have people for this.

40:36.820 --> 40:37.860
Things are tough, but-

40:37.860 --> 40:38.820
I got a little printing.

40:38.820 --> 40:39.940
We're all doing it from home now.

40:39.940 --> 40:41.940
Just printing books by hand.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.420
The paperback copy of City of Girls,

40:44.420 --> 40:46.420
which I read and enjoyed.

40:46.420 --> 40:49.220
It's a rocking tale of life in New York City.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.500
I thought it was very...

40:50.500 --> 40:52.580
It painted a lot of beautiful pictures in my mind.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.980
Nice. Thanks, Vinny.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.220
What a great way to describe the reading.

40:57.220 --> 40:59.620
It's the power of books, as I like to say

40:59.620 --> 41:02.260
when I talk about the good things that books do.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.540
I made you hallucinate.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.700
That's the benefit of publishing

41:09.700 --> 41:12.340
out of your own Xerox printer at your house,

41:12.340 --> 41:14.660
is you can just douse each page

41:14.660 --> 41:18.900
in a hallucinogenic, touchable drug.

41:20.340 --> 41:20.820
Yes.

41:20.820 --> 41:21.780
I have a question.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.620
I know that was an off-ramp,

41:23.620 --> 41:25.140
but I do have a question for you.

41:25.140 --> 41:26.980
You're, as a creative person,

41:27.540 --> 41:29.860
and you've written and thought a lot about creativity,

41:30.820 --> 41:32.180
and this is a complete pivot,

41:32.180 --> 41:33.300
and I apologize to our listeners

41:33.300 --> 41:34.820
because this must be so jarring

41:34.820 --> 41:36.740
for a show as consistent and structured as ours.

41:36.740 --> 41:41.940
I tend to think of creativity as putting a bunch

41:41.940 --> 41:44.100
of different garbage in your mind

41:44.100 --> 41:46.900
and rearranging it in interesting ways.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.100
No, that's podcasting.

41:49.700 --> 41:50.500
Hang up.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.780
Hang up the phone.

41:51.780 --> 41:52.820
I can't with you.

41:52.820 --> 41:53.380
Let's go over.

41:53.380 --> 41:53.860
I can't.

41:54.980 --> 41:55.700
Okay, so...

41:55.700 --> 41:56.340
Okay, go ahead.

41:56.340 --> 41:56.980
I don't have...

41:58.180 --> 41:59.460
In this world of ours,

42:00.020 --> 42:01.300
I can still watch YouTube,

42:01.300 --> 42:03.060
and I'm loving it for sure,

42:03.060 --> 42:04.980
but I'm definitely feeling myself

42:04.980 --> 42:10.820
a little starved of the outside impulses of the world

42:10.820 --> 42:16.340
that feed into the creative engine.

42:16.340 --> 42:17.780
Is that something you're struggling with at all?

42:17.780 --> 42:19.220
And if people are,

42:20.500 --> 42:21.460
what do you think?

42:21.460 --> 42:22.660
Do you have a hot take?

42:22.660 --> 42:25.540
So are you saying that in order for you to be inspired,

42:25.540 --> 42:26.820
you kind of have to go out in the world

42:26.820 --> 42:28.500
and roll around in it,

42:28.500 --> 42:29.380
but you personally,

42:29.380 --> 42:30.820
that that's how it works for you?

42:30.820 --> 42:32.260
I didn't think so before

42:32.260 --> 42:34.340
because I do not like going out there.

42:34.340 --> 42:36.660
Well, that's what was surprising me about the question.

42:37.540 --> 42:39.380
But I'm forced out there frequently

42:39.380 --> 42:42.100
by touring and obligations, right?

42:42.100 --> 42:43.140
And apparently,

42:43.140 --> 42:45.700
I was drawing more on the outside world than I thought

42:45.700 --> 42:47.060
because I got nothing right now.

42:47.620 --> 42:48.500
Right.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.260
Well, I guess you have to just do like...

42:51.700 --> 42:52.900
It's kind of like the difference

42:52.900 --> 42:55.220
between Emily Dickinson's poems

42:55.220 --> 42:56.660
and like Walt Whitman's poems.

42:56.660 --> 42:58.340
You've chosen the exact right people

42:58.340 --> 42:59.460
to make this reference with.

42:59.460 --> 42:59.940
Go on.

42:59.940 --> 43:02.900
Yeah.

43:02.900 --> 43:05.220
So Walt Whitman's poetry is all about

43:05.220 --> 43:07.460
going and rolling in the earth

43:07.460 --> 43:08.580
and taking it in.

43:08.580 --> 43:10.820
And Emily Dickinson never left her bedroom,

43:10.820 --> 43:13.860
but she still wrote an incredible body of work.

43:13.860 --> 43:17.140
I think you just have to start looking at the world

43:17.140 --> 43:20.900
through the eyes of a 19th century spinster poetess.

43:22.980 --> 43:24.900
You probably know way more about this than I do.

43:24.900 --> 43:28.500
I know, I think, one thing about each of those people,

43:28.500 --> 43:29.620
and it is this.

43:29.620 --> 43:32.260
Wouldn't you say Walt Whitman was, I don't know,

43:32.260 --> 43:36.260
happier than Emily Dickinson?

43:36.260 --> 43:37.540
Listen, Travis, do you want to be happy

43:37.540 --> 43:40.100
or do you want to make great, was it poems?

43:40.100 --> 43:40.980
Poems.

43:40.980 --> 43:42.500
It was poems that she made.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.980
I think you might have been a little bit happier yet.

43:46.260 --> 43:47.300
Yeah, I think, you know,

43:47.300 --> 43:49.460
I'm actually surprised by the opposite

43:49.460 --> 43:52.340
because I am a traveler

43:52.340 --> 43:54.740
and yet I'm finding that I'm quite enjoying

43:54.740 --> 43:58.020
my little quarantine time at home.

43:58.020 --> 44:00.420
Did you guys Freaky Friday?

44:00.420 --> 44:02.580
Maybe Freaky Friday.

44:02.580 --> 44:04.980
Yeah, it could be.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.420
Not sure, because I'm doing different kinds

44:08.420 --> 44:09.140
of creativity now.

44:09.140 --> 44:13.300
Like I've gotten, I ordered a bunch of watercolor paper

44:13.300 --> 44:16.820
and pens and I'm actually drawing.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.500
I've never, haven't done that since I was a kid.

44:19.140 --> 44:20.580
That's a good thing to do when you're inside.

44:20.580 --> 44:23.060
So do some art, do some art art

44:23.060 --> 44:24.980
and then make jokes about that, I guess.

44:24.980 --> 44:26.500
I don't know how that turns into,

44:26.500 --> 44:28.100
how you turn that into comedy gold.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.980
But that would be art, art, art at that point.

44:32.420 --> 44:33.780
Yeah, too many arts.

44:33.780 --> 44:34.340
Too many, okay.

44:34.340 --> 44:35.140
Too many love.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.220
Hey, can I just congratulate you guys

44:37.220 --> 44:40.180
on your 500th episode very recently?

44:40.180 --> 44:41.620
Thank you so much.

44:41.620 --> 44:42.900
That's incredible.

44:42.900 --> 44:45.860
I actually think this is for next week's episode.

44:45.860 --> 44:49.620
This is our 10 year anniversary celebration.

44:49.620 --> 44:50.420
Believe it or not.

44:50.420 --> 44:51.300
So incredible.

44:51.300 --> 44:52.900
We've been podcasting for 10 years.

44:52.900 --> 44:57.140
You have brought this woman so much joy

44:57.700 --> 44:58.740
over those 10 years.

44:58.740 --> 45:01.140
I can't even tell you how I've taken you

45:01.140 --> 45:02.420
all over the world with me.

45:02.420 --> 45:04.500
We've gone on extremely long walks together

45:04.500 --> 45:05.460
in interesting places.

45:06.820 --> 45:08.660
I'm so grateful that you exist.

45:08.660 --> 45:10.500
And I also wanted to say I was a little jealous

45:10.500 --> 45:13.140
on your 500th episode and your kids were on

45:13.140 --> 45:14.340
and you were interviewing your kids

45:14.340 --> 45:17.460
about what their favorite Bim Bam episodes were.

45:17.460 --> 45:20.100
And I was like, my hand was raised.

45:20.900 --> 45:22.100
We didn't call on you.

45:22.100 --> 45:23.060
So rude.

45:23.060 --> 45:25.780
Can I answer that just to get it out of my system?

45:25.780 --> 45:26.420
Sure, please.

45:26.420 --> 45:27.140
Please.

45:27.140 --> 45:28.900
It would be the Ballad of Tit Liquid.

45:29.540 --> 45:30.020
Oh, yeah.

45:30.580 --> 45:31.140
Thank you.

45:31.140 --> 45:31.780
Yeah, that was-

45:31.780 --> 45:33.460
I've listened to it several times.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.060
Whenever I need a lift, I go back

45:35.060 --> 45:36.500
and just listen to that little bit

45:36.500 --> 45:38.340
because it's so incredibly funny.

45:38.980 --> 45:41.380
So thank you for letting me get that off my chest.

45:42.820 --> 45:45.060
I'm glad that you could share that

45:45.060 --> 45:46.740
at great personal cost to me.

45:47.860 --> 45:49.300
What a generous host we are.

45:49.300 --> 45:51.940
So City of Girls is out in paperback.

45:51.940 --> 45:54.900
There's lots of other books you can buy by Elizabeth Gilbert.

45:54.900 --> 45:55.620
And you should probably buy-

45:55.620 --> 45:56.820
I mean, I'm glad you clarified

45:56.820 --> 45:58.980
because there are lots of other books you could buy.

45:58.980 --> 46:01.860
Yeah, no, buy Elizabeth Gilbert specifically.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.300
Buy City of Girls or don't.

46:03.300 --> 46:06.020
Travis, actually, I'd rather right now

46:06.020 --> 46:08.260
we just focus not on the lots of other books

46:08.260 --> 46:09.140
that people could buy.

46:09.140 --> 46:10.260
Oh, okay, right, right, right.

46:10.260 --> 46:11.460
Yeah, just these few books.

46:11.460 --> 46:12.980
Just City of Girls or another book.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.980
Just this little handful.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.820
Call your local bookstore.

46:16.820 --> 46:18.740
I bet they could maybe ship it to you.

46:18.740 --> 46:21.380
And that's nice that you're supporting two great people,

46:21.380 --> 46:23.300
your local bookstore and Elizabeth Gilbert.

46:23.300 --> 46:28.020
There's also a new really good alternative to Amazon,

46:28.020 --> 46:29.860
which is called bookshop.org.

46:29.860 --> 46:31.860
And you can just go to bookshop.org

46:31.860 --> 46:34.740
and you can buy books from independent bookstores online

46:34.740 --> 46:36.420
as easily as you could do it on Amazon.

46:36.420 --> 46:38.020
So if you don't know how to support

46:38.020 --> 46:39.060
your local independent bookstore,

46:39.060 --> 46:41.220
that's an easy way to do it wherever you are.

46:41.220 --> 46:41.620
Excellent.

46:41.620 --> 46:43.060
Hey, this is Jeff Bezos.

46:43.060 --> 46:44.500
I'm listening on all the podcasts

46:44.500 --> 46:45.220
while they're making them.

46:45.220 --> 46:47.220
I just need you to delete that one part.

46:47.220 --> 46:49.540
If you delete that one part for me, I don't like it.

46:49.540 --> 46:50.260
I don't want it.

46:50.260 --> 46:51.780
And delete that for me, please.

46:51.780 --> 46:53.540
Elizabeth Gilbert, this is Jeff Bezos.

46:53.540 --> 46:55.060
We're canceling all your books.

46:55.060 --> 46:59.060
Hey, Jeff, Elizabeth, pleasure to meet you.

46:59.060 --> 46:59.940
I'm Jesse Thorne.

46:59.940 --> 47:01.620
I heard you guys are doing free ads

47:02.580 --> 47:03.940
without anybody paying for them.

47:03.940 --> 47:05.460
And I'm going to cut that out too.

47:05.460 --> 47:06.660
I listen to all the shows too.

47:07.380 --> 47:09.140
This is what I've always sounded like.

47:09.140 --> 47:11.300
While you're relaxing on your Casper mattress,

47:11.300 --> 47:13.700
you can buy yourself a book from Bookshop.org.

47:13.700 --> 47:16.260
You're giving away thousands of dollars.

47:16.260 --> 47:17.940
Please don't mention my mattresses

47:17.940 --> 47:18.900
unless I pay for it.

47:18.900 --> 47:20.580
I'm a very outstanding young man

47:20.580 --> 47:21.860
and I won't stand for it.

47:21.860 --> 47:24.820
That's robbing from you, the creator.

47:24.820 --> 47:26.260
And I respect you.

47:26.260 --> 47:30.100
Jon Casper, Jesse Thorne, this is me, Jeff Bezos again.

47:30.100 --> 47:32.100
I just wanted to say I'm excited to see you two

47:32.100 --> 47:35.300
at our secretive billionaires hunting party.

47:35.300 --> 47:37.620
And we'll catch y'all there.

47:37.620 --> 47:43.380
Hey, I love all this.

47:43.380 --> 47:49.140
Hi, this is Jimmy Squarespace.

47:49.140 --> 47:51.140
All right, Elizabeth Gilbert, thank you.

47:51.140 --> 47:52.180
You know, the standing offer

47:52.180 --> 47:54.420
to just permanently join the show still stands.

47:55.140 --> 47:56.580
Anytime you want to take us on.

47:56.580 --> 47:57.380
Anytime.

47:57.380 --> 48:00.020
I'll quit anytime to make room for you.

48:00.020 --> 48:00.820
I love you guys.

48:00.820 --> 48:01.540
Be safe.

48:01.540 --> 48:01.940
You too.

48:01.940 --> 48:02.500
We love you too.

48:02.500 --> 48:03.540
Okay, bye-bye.

48:03.540 --> 48:04.040
Bye.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.060
What?

48:07.060 --> 48:07.460
Yes.

48:09.940 --> 48:10.340
Okay.

48:10.340 --> 48:21.940
I want to grow, I want to heal, fix this failing planet

48:24.580 --> 48:26.500
with fast food meals.

48:28.580 --> 48:34.100
Welcome to Munch Squad, colon, brands are here for you.

48:34.100 --> 48:39.540
A lot of people have been thinking in this crisis,

48:40.340 --> 48:42.500
have the brands abandoned me?

48:42.500 --> 48:47.620
Have my favorite fast food brands abandoned me?

48:47.620 --> 48:49.060
And I've been feeling it too,

48:49.060 --> 48:52.500
because they stopped cranking out hot new menu items

48:52.500 --> 48:53.300
for me to discuss.

48:53.300 --> 48:54.420
So I felt abandoned.

48:54.420 --> 48:57.780
So I started digging and I realized that the brands

48:57.780 --> 49:01.140
haven't had time to make great new menu items for me

49:01.140 --> 49:04.260
because they're busy fucking doing their part

49:04.980 --> 49:08.420
to help heal this incredible crisis

49:08.420 --> 49:11.060
that our entire planet finds itself embroiled in.

49:11.060 --> 49:21.300
So with a spirit, a good-natured and a pat on the shoulder

49:21.300 --> 49:24.340
and maybe a slightly patronizing nod,

49:24.340 --> 49:26.660
I want to give you some of the updates

49:26.660 --> 49:31.460
on what our brands are doing to help sort of do their part.

49:32.100 --> 49:36.580
Carl's Jr's slash Hardee's are providing and eat.

49:36.580 --> 49:38.580
A lot of people are doing family meals,

49:38.580 --> 49:41.860
let you get a big old mess of food for a good price

49:41.860 --> 49:44.580
to take home to your family, save you a bunch of hassle,

49:44.580 --> 49:45.700
which is great.

49:45.700 --> 49:49.220
Carl's Jr and Hardee's are still charging you money for them.

49:49.220 --> 49:50.500
This is still a transaction.

49:50.500 --> 49:53.860
They've adjusted their product to meet the current demand.

49:53.860 --> 49:56.820
Carl's Jr and Hardee are providing, but they, boy howdy,

49:56.820 --> 49:58.900
do these brands feel pretty proud of the fact

49:58.900 --> 50:00.740
that they froze their food for you.

50:00.740 --> 50:03.700
Carl's Jr and Hardee are providing an easy solution

50:03.700 --> 50:06.580
for family meals in an effort to help people focus

50:06.580 --> 50:08.420
on taking care of their families

50:08.420 --> 50:10.500
while we take care of the burgers and biscuits.

50:11.700 --> 50:13.780
While we keep the burgers and biscuits safe,

50:13.780 --> 50:16.580
we're protecting the burgers and the biscuits

50:16.580 --> 50:18.740
in support of the families across the country

50:18.740 --> 50:21.380
that are coming together around mealtime.

50:21.380 --> 50:25.140
Carl's Jr and Hardee's are launching the new family bundles menu

50:25.140 --> 50:27.860
that includes signature items like charbroiled burgers,

50:27.860 --> 50:30.660
hand-breaded chicken tenders, and made-from-scratch biscuits,

50:30.660 --> 50:33.620
providing everything you love for everyone you love,

50:33.620 --> 50:35.060
bundled up, and priced right.

50:35.060 --> 50:39.940
I'm talking about little Jeffrey.

50:39.940 --> 50:42.500
I'm talking about sweet Susan, your wife.

50:42.500 --> 50:45.300
Let's get her filled up with these charbroiled broils.

50:45.300 --> 50:46.260
We love them.

50:46.260 --> 50:47.300
We love you.

50:47.300 --> 50:48.340
Please eat our broils.

50:48.340 --> 50:50.820
That's going to be kicking off Thursday,

50:50.820 --> 50:52.820
family menu bundle by drive-thru.

50:52.820 --> 50:55.620
You can pick them up as Carl's Jr and Hardee's

50:55.620 --> 50:57.700
remain committed to serving their communities

50:58.500 --> 51:03.380
for a reasonable fee and helping everyone to feed their happy.

51:04.180 --> 51:07.780
Boston Market, they got a little bit more of a religious focus.

51:09.060 --> 51:11.060
With all this, they got their own meal deals,

51:11.060 --> 51:12.340
their own frozen meal deals.

51:12.340 --> 51:14.340
With all that's happening around the world right now,

51:14.980 --> 51:17.700
we know that Easter celebrations will be different

51:17.700 --> 51:18.900
and smaller this year,

51:18.900 --> 51:21.700
says Boston Market Chief Executive Officer Eric Wyatt.

51:22.260 --> 51:24.420
Our team at Boston Market would like to help

51:24.420 --> 51:26.900
with any type of Easter meal you might be planning,

51:26.900 --> 51:29.460
with numerous convenient options available for pickup,

51:29.460 --> 51:31.860
home delivery, or home shipment.

51:31.860 --> 51:36.500
The health and safety of both our guests and our team members

51:36.500 --> 51:38.900
is our top priority, so we want to do everything we can

51:38.900 --> 51:42.580
to ensure everyone has a safe and healthy holiday this Easter.

51:42.580 --> 51:44.020
I appreciate you, Boston Market.

51:44.020 --> 51:44.420
Thank you.

51:44.420 --> 51:46.340
Zaxby's got their own meal deals.

51:47.300 --> 51:49.780
Quote, we wanted to create an affordable meal

51:49.780 --> 51:52.340
featuring our signature menu items for families

51:52.340 --> 51:55.460
during these challenging times, says Zach McLeroy,

51:55.460 --> 51:57.300
Zaxby's CEO and co-founder.

51:57.300 --> 52:00.500
Have you noticed how we never hear from the CEOs,

52:00.500 --> 52:03.540
but now that they've frozen a lot of food in big boxes,

52:03.540 --> 52:06.740
now they'll come down from their fucking sedans

52:06.740 --> 52:08.820
to waltz amongst us Cometers.

52:08.820 --> 52:11.380
Well, Justin, they did it for our families

52:11.380 --> 52:12.740
and our sick cousin.

52:12.740 --> 52:15.940
And our sick cousin. For the communities and the families.

52:15.940 --> 52:19.300
Our sick cousin, Dave, and everyone, all of them.

52:20.580 --> 52:25.300
Zaxby's is always focused on bringing people together

52:25.300 --> 52:28.980
with flavorful comfort food made with uncompromising quality.

52:28.980 --> 52:30.420
I have always said that.

52:30.420 --> 52:33.780
Zaxby's, their number one thing is bringing people together.

52:34.580 --> 52:37.220
Now, more than ever, we're all family.

52:37.780 --> 52:41.300
Just, you know, family that will charge you $20

52:41.300 --> 52:43.620
for a large tray of frozen chicken fingers.

52:43.620 --> 52:45.700
Oh wait, are you guys not doing that in your house?

52:45.700 --> 52:47.780
Like when BB comes to eat, I'm like, $12.

52:48.500 --> 52:49.620
$12 please.

52:50.420 --> 52:51.140
This is good.

52:51.860 --> 52:53.860
Zaxby's is like, this is all very well and good.

52:53.860 --> 52:55.380
What if they don't know our name?

52:55.380 --> 52:58.100
An alternative to fast food, fuck off,

52:58.100 --> 53:00.500
Zaxby's serves fresh, prepared at order,

53:00.500 --> 53:02.900
hand breaded chicken fingers with a Z

53:02.900 --> 53:06.180
and wings that can be tossed in a variety of nine sauces.

53:06.180 --> 53:08.820
The menu also features four salads.

53:08.820 --> 53:11.140
I'm not reading the rest of the things they have for sale.

53:11.140 --> 53:13.140
Next quote, Zaxby's has been serving up

53:13.140 --> 53:15.940
premium chicken fingers and wings for 30 years.

53:15.940 --> 53:16.500
Read a book.

53:17.620 --> 53:19.940
We want our guests to know we're here for you now

53:19.940 --> 53:21.380
and we're not going anywhere.

53:22.260 --> 53:24.820
Quote, we'll weather this storm together

53:24.820 --> 53:27.620
and come through it stronger than ever.

53:29.220 --> 53:33.620
Zaxby's, they're here forever for you.

53:33.620 --> 53:37.620
You can't kill Zaxby's by conventional methods.

53:37.620 --> 53:40.260
We are immune, we had it once, we got over it.

53:40.260 --> 53:41.380
We're an immune now.

53:41.380 --> 53:45.220
We have no lungs to infect with Zaxby's.

53:45.220 --> 53:48.660
We're all fingers and we don't wash them.

53:49.700 --> 53:50.740
At some point.

53:50.740 --> 53:50.980
Yeah.

53:51.700 --> 53:57.140
Lastly, the one that I do want to especially hold up

53:57.140 --> 53:59.220
as I tear down is White Castle

53:59.220 --> 54:02.580
because they are actually doing anything

54:02.580 --> 54:06.260
that is charitable from April 7th to April 30th.

54:06.820 --> 54:09.300
Healthcare workers and EMTs can go through

54:09.300 --> 54:12.500
the drive-through of any White Castle restaurant each day

54:12.500 --> 54:16.660
to receive one free combo meal or breakfast combo.

54:16.660 --> 54:18.260
They just have to show their work ID.

54:18.260 --> 54:18.820
Fuck yeah.

54:19.620 --> 54:23.140
So I want to say White Castle, that is wonderful.

54:23.780 --> 54:25.940
White Castle team members will be delivering

54:25.940 --> 54:28.820
crave cases of sliders to hospitals

54:28.820 --> 54:31.380
and other healthcare facilities in the regions

54:31.380 --> 54:33.380
where White Castle has restaurants.

54:33.380 --> 54:33.860
That's good.

54:33.860 --> 54:35.540
The alternative would have been insane.

54:35.540 --> 54:39.860
We're going to be air dropping White Castle all over this nation.

54:39.860 --> 54:43.060
We put them in a White Castle cannon and blasting them off.

54:43.060 --> 54:46.020
On April 6th, White Castle delivered 1200 sliders

54:46.020 --> 54:48.660
to four hospitals in the Detroit area.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.700
That is very good.

54:49.700 --> 54:54.580
Although I cannot imagine that the smell of 1200 White Castle sliders

54:54.580 --> 54:56.980
has made that situation a lot more appealing.

54:58.100 --> 54:59.460
It's about the taste, Justin.

54:59.460 --> 55:01.220
You don't smell these wet squares.

55:01.220 --> 55:02.100
They say that.

55:02.100 --> 55:03.380
They print that on the napkin.

55:03.380 --> 55:04.500
Don't smell our wet squares.

55:04.500 --> 55:05.940
Just eat them because they taste good.

55:06.580 --> 55:07.940
In the midst of this pandemic,

55:07.940 --> 55:10.340
healthcare workers have put it all on the line

55:10.340 --> 55:12.260
to serve and take care of us.

55:12.260 --> 55:14.180
Now it's our turn to serve them,

55:14.180 --> 55:16.820
says Jamie Richardson, vice president at White Castle.

55:16.820 --> 55:20.020
I'm hoping the president was extremely, extremely busy

55:20.020 --> 55:21.780
because they couldn't come out for this one.

55:21.780 --> 55:24.420
Providing free sliders and meals to healthcare workers

55:24.420 --> 55:26.340
is a way for us to show our appreciation

55:26.340 --> 55:28.020
for everything they're doing right now.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.340
So White Castle, a little good natured,

55:30.340 --> 55:34.820
funny expense, but good on you for really supporting people.

55:34.820 --> 55:38.980
And that's what's going on as our brands are taking care of us.

55:38.980 --> 55:40.500
So thank you, brands.

55:40.500 --> 55:42.660
I know we're going to get through this together.

55:42.660 --> 55:45.700
Stronger, stronger, stronger together.

55:45.700 --> 55:47.940
Zaxby's says stronger than ever.

55:47.940 --> 55:48.340
We're going to come through this one.

55:48.340 --> 55:50.500
It's going to be better after, even.

55:51.700 --> 55:55.940
Zaxby's is like, it's going to be even better after.

55:55.940 --> 55:57.620
You're going to be like, fuck all that.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.980
Zaxby's has been looking for its chance to grow, you know?

56:00.980 --> 56:06.260
And sometimes, sometimes that little tree in the forest

56:06.900 --> 56:08.900
needs another tree to maybe fall over

56:08.900 --> 56:11.540
to get a little more sunlight on that little tree.

56:11.540 --> 56:14.260
Zaxby's is hoping some of its big siblings

56:14.900 --> 56:16.500
maybe go down in this.

56:16.500 --> 56:18.980
So Zaxby's ends up being stronger than ever.

56:19.780 --> 56:21.860
More power, yeah, extremely powerful.

56:21.860 --> 56:23.060
Thank you, Zaxby's.

56:23.060 --> 56:25.940
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

56:25.940 --> 56:28.580
And sincerely, I know we got all mushy at 500,

56:28.580 --> 56:30.660
so we're not going to do all that again.

56:30.660 --> 56:33.300
I will say, though, 10 years, come on.

56:33.300 --> 56:34.180
You're too good to us.

56:34.820 --> 56:37.780
It's really very kind of you to continue to hang in there with us.

56:37.780 --> 56:39.300
We know our best years are behind us.

56:39.300 --> 56:40.420
We know that, you know that.

56:41.140 --> 56:42.740
But the fact that you've clung in here,

56:42.740 --> 56:45.540
even in the Twilight years, is very meaningful to us.

56:45.540 --> 56:46.500
So thank you so much.

56:47.380 --> 56:51.380
Yeah, I do not know what we can say that we did not say,

56:51.380 --> 56:54.260
like, what, five episodes ago at this point?

56:54.260 --> 56:58.100
But I feel like 10 years is a sort of different milestone,

56:58.100 --> 57:01.620
at least on our end, chronologically speaking,

57:01.620 --> 57:04.420
to it is easier for me to look back at where I was 10 years ago

57:04.420 --> 57:05.140
and where I am now.

57:05.140 --> 57:08.900
And where I am now is because of you all listening at home.

57:08.900 --> 57:09.860
So thank you all so much.

57:11.220 --> 57:15.540
Thank you to Elizabeth Gilbert, who is so good, just like the best.

57:15.540 --> 57:17.300
Just a good, just like a really good person.

57:17.300 --> 57:19.140
Good person, funny, and very talented.

57:20.660 --> 57:23.700
And I don't think we mentioned this during her segment,

57:23.700 --> 57:27.940
but if you are struggling with creativity during this time,

57:28.500 --> 57:29.380
check out Big Magic.

57:29.380 --> 57:32.180
It's another book of hers that she wrote just about being creative.

57:32.180 --> 57:34.020
Even if you aren't struggling with creativity,

57:34.020 --> 57:36.740
read Big Magic because it's a life changer.

57:38.180 --> 57:39.940
So this is a big thing we should talk about too,

57:40.660 --> 57:43.700
because with our 10 year anniversary,

57:43.700 --> 57:47.140
we decided to do a little bit of rebranding.

57:47.940 --> 57:48.980
Well, I'll get to that in a second.

57:49.700 --> 57:51.940
Some new designs, new logos, that kind of stuff.

57:51.940 --> 57:53.140
And you can check that out.

57:53.140 --> 57:56.020
We'll be sharing it and you'll see it on all our new stuff.

57:56.020 --> 57:59.620
Big credit to Sarah McKay, who did the redesign

57:59.620 --> 58:01.780
and it's just absolutely gorgeous.

58:01.780 --> 58:03.060
And I love it so much.

58:03.060 --> 58:04.260
Wild about it.

58:04.260 --> 58:08.580
We're gonna have some new merch up with that rebranded stuff

58:08.580 --> 58:15.300
up on McElroyMerch.com, including a 10 year commemorative plate

58:16.020 --> 58:19.940
that made a lot more sense to make three months ago

58:19.940 --> 58:22.660
when we started working on it.

58:22.660 --> 58:23.160
Right.

58:27.060 --> 58:31.860
Sometimes it's January and you come up with a funny joke

58:32.500 --> 58:34.660
that does cost money, right?

58:34.660 --> 58:34.980
Yes.

58:34.980 --> 58:37.540
And then it's April and the face of the world

58:37.540 --> 58:39.140
has been forever changed.

58:39.140 --> 58:40.740
But the plates are still there, huh?

58:41.540 --> 58:42.980
That you still made them.

58:42.980 --> 58:44.820
There's nothing you can do about it.

58:44.820 --> 58:48.740
You don't have to, listen, you don't have to buy the plates.

58:48.740 --> 58:49.300
We get it.

58:49.300 --> 58:51.940
We do have to try to, we have to put them up for sale

58:51.940 --> 58:54.500
because the alternative is just us hoarding plates

58:54.500 --> 58:55.860
with our faces on it.

58:55.860 --> 58:57.220
They're really, really good.

58:57.220 --> 59:00.340
But like, I just like before you, like, we get it.

59:00.340 --> 59:03.060
Okay, like, we get it.

59:04.180 --> 59:05.060
So anyways, check that out.

59:05.060 --> 59:06.340
McElroyMerch.com.

59:06.340 --> 59:10.180
We also have, for you stalwarts, there is a shirt

59:10.180 --> 59:14.260
with the old logo on it protesting the new logo.

59:14.260 --> 59:16.580
And I do want to thank, in that spirit,

59:16.580 --> 59:19.300
I want to thank Justin Russo, a friend of ours

59:19.300 --> 59:23.540
who 10 years ago made that original logo

59:24.260 --> 59:26.180
and he's still alive today.

59:26.180 --> 59:28.980
So thank you, Justin, for that shirt.

59:28.980 --> 59:31.300
You can support Justin.

59:31.300 --> 59:33.780
We're giving him, you know, he gets his beak wet

59:33.780 --> 59:35.380
when you buy one of these protest shirts.

59:35.380 --> 59:36.820
So they're there too if you want to.

59:36.820 --> 59:39.060
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

59:39.060 --> 59:40.820
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

59:40.820 --> 59:42.260
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:42.900 --> 59:44.180
Fantastic little ditty.

59:44.180 --> 59:46.900
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

59:46.900 --> 59:49.460
Go to MaximumFun.org, check out all the great shows there.

59:49.460 --> 59:52.740
Shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself

59:52.740 --> 59:57.780
and Judge John Hodgman and Switchblade Sisters

59:57.780 --> 59:58.900
and a whole bunch more.

59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.780
And like Travis and Justin, I think both have said,

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.620
we have other stuff at McElroy.Family.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.980
Hey, go check out the movie Trolls World Tour

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.220
featuring your boys.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.060
And I think that's it.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.340
Yep.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.260
So here is a final Yahoo!

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.820
that was sent in by a bunch of people.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.380
Graham Roebuck, Adrian Cowles, a bunch of folks

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.420
sent this one in, thank you all.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.220
It's from Yahoo! Answers user Mike who asks,

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.380
can science make a Spider-Man?

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.300
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.500
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.620
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.220
This has been my brother, my brother,

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:44.420
me, Kiss Your Dad, Square on the Lips.
