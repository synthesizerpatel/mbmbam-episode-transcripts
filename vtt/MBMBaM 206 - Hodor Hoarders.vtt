00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:49.120
Welcome to the Solstice! I knew it! That's what I was gonna do!

00:49.120 --> 00:53.680
It's my brother, my brother, and we special summer solstice episode.

00:53.680 --> 00:59.520
As we dance amongst the fairy rings. The sky hangs high with the brightness of a

00:59.520 --> 01:03.520
luna as the sun beams down on us from its highest position.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.040
Lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt.

01:07.040 --> 01:12.800
Let's all start fucking. My, there's only three of us here.

01:12.800 --> 01:18.320
It's hugely creepy. I'm the oldest traveler, Justin McElroy.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.800
I'm the middle-est and naked-est to Travis McElroy. I'm free!

01:22.800 --> 01:25.520
I emerged from the mist one. I emerged from the mist two.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.960
I emerged from the mist three. Hi, my name is Griffin McElroy.

01:28.960 --> 01:36.160
I'm a level 14 troll berserker. And I, sorry, I hate to.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.080
One of you guys buffed me while I was emerging from the mist,

01:40.080 --> 01:43.760
which is LARP rules like 101. You gotta wait for me to be summoned

01:43.760 --> 01:48.720
before we can begin our encounter. I actually have an enchanted mirror of

01:48.720 --> 01:52.720
Conchlin Crong and it helps me to see you from the mist.

01:52.720 --> 01:56.720
Have you had those new, those Fritos Conchlin Crong?

01:56.720 --> 02:02.080
They're so good. They're buffalo blasted.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.960
I did just watch Monster Camp again, so I am like coming hot and fresh

02:06.960 --> 02:10.800
off the like, that glow that you get after you watch Monster Camp.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.080
People watch Monster Camp. I think you have to like rent it on Amazon Instant

02:14.080 --> 02:17.600
Video or something like that. It's an important movie and it's one of

02:17.600 --> 02:19.840
those movies that you watch it and you're like,

02:19.840 --> 02:23.840
this is a crazy world I know nothing about and I never will. Look at these,

02:23.840 --> 02:28.720
look at all these people. And then also you feel like,

02:28.720 --> 02:32.880
could I maybe like uh, could I maybe dip in?

02:32.880 --> 02:36.640
That is the great dark secret of Monster Camp is that you

02:36.640 --> 02:39.840
watch it. You were the monster the whole time. You were the monster the whole time.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.480
You will watch this movie with your significant other

02:42.480 --> 02:46.560
and your your wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend will be watching it and

02:46.560 --> 02:50.400
laughing and you'll be laughing. Inside you there's another you that's not

02:50.400 --> 02:53.760
laughing. Not laughing at all. There's another you that says maybe I

02:53.760 --> 02:57.840
could dip in. It's weeping with a fantastic longing.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.840
I want our listeners to know that I felt like that

03:01.840 --> 03:07.280
goof was general enough that I can't imagine we were making fun of any

03:07.280 --> 03:10.240
specific group. No, I think we were mostly making fun of ourselves.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.680
Yeah, I felt that way too. Because of our distinct lack of knowledge of what the

03:13.680 --> 03:17.760
Solstice is, what it does. Don't you take this as an opportunity to

03:17.760 --> 03:21.520
educate it either, dear listeners. I'm onto your game. You can educate me.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.120
I like learning stuff. I'm not afraid to learn and expand and grow as a person.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.440
I'm done with that. I feel like I have to with a with a child so close I feel

03:29.440 --> 03:34.400
like I have to cauterize myself as a human. I have to like

03:34.400 --> 03:37.760
you can't grow anymore. I don't want to grow anymore because that would be

03:37.760 --> 03:42.000
confusing for them. So I basically just have to cap it off

03:42.000 --> 03:44.880
here. Well and then it's all like bigotry and

03:44.880 --> 03:49.600
ignorance and just waiting.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.280
I guess. Well and then you start to pass on your memories to the child

03:53.280 --> 03:57.040
as like what it's like to sled and what the color red looks like.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.440
Right. And and how cinnabons taste. And where the baby hole in the wall is where

04:01.440 --> 04:05.920
you put the bad babies. Mm-hmm. That's dark book. Is it dark book?

04:05.920 --> 04:09.920
Dark book. I'm glad they want a new berry then. Yeah did it win a new berry?

04:09.920 --> 04:14.000
I believe it won a new berry. Can we get to the comedy already? I'm dying

04:14.000 --> 04:18.720
inside and outside. I have noticed that the way I shake

04:18.720 --> 04:22.560
hands with people may be a little off. I have a firm grip

04:22.560 --> 04:25.600
but I tend to counter the other person's pumps

04:25.600 --> 04:29.760
with trying not to pump at all. Instead I flex my shoulder and arm

04:29.760 --> 04:32.800
so while the person is trying to move their arm up and down my arm stays

04:32.800 --> 04:37.920
completely still. Yeah pump that shit. Just try and pump that shit idiot. Pump it.

04:37.920 --> 04:41.360
I imagine the other person encounters some unexpected resistance to an

04:41.360 --> 04:44.560
otherwise routine bump or two. Brothers how am I supposed to be doing

04:44.560 --> 04:47.120
this? You know how you're supposed to be doing

04:47.120 --> 04:49.440
this? That's from wrestling in Winchester.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.520
Now listen my brother my brother me listeners. Before you start laughing too

04:53.520 --> 04:56.080
hard I've shaken a lot of your hands. You're

04:56.080 --> 05:00.240
a wonderful people. Kind. Oh I love your spirit. So many of

05:00.240 --> 05:03.840
you came up to the LA show. We met so many

05:03.840 --> 05:07.760
so many beautiful hearts. Sometimes you're bad at handshakes. I've shaken a lot of

05:07.760 --> 05:10.560
your hands. Some of you could pick up a tip or two.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.360
That's all I'm saying. I always just assume that it's like

05:13.360 --> 05:16.960
and not because I've done this before as well like if you're standing on a line

05:16.960 --> 05:19.920
for something or you're waiting and you know that handshake's coming

05:19.920 --> 05:23.440
like if somebody just encountered you at random was like hey and you shook their

05:23.440 --> 05:25.600
hand you would nail it you know 100 percent

05:25.600 --> 05:29.200
but then when you have time to think about it yeah I'm about to shake this

05:29.200 --> 05:32.640
hand it's up and down right no wait hold on be proactive about it

05:32.640 --> 05:36.640
wait if you're if you're waiting in line to like after one of our live shows you

05:36.640 --> 05:40.320
want to shake our hand and like that's super cool um go ahead

05:40.320 --> 05:43.760
and like get your hand ready do do a little bit of pre-pro on that

05:43.760 --> 05:46.880
hand to make it perfect for us maybe breathe into it a little bit to

05:46.880 --> 05:51.680
get it to the ideal temperature for me that's 96.5 a little bit cooler

05:51.680 --> 05:54.720
than normal um I like a definitely not warmer

05:54.720 --> 05:58.320
definitely not wet definitely dry that hair right off

05:58.320 --> 06:02.640
I'm not sure which um which handshake I find more upsetting like

06:02.640 --> 06:06.080
on the one hand you got the one that feels like their arm

06:06.080 --> 06:09.600
was like somebody filled up a jello mold that's shaped like an arm

06:09.600 --> 06:12.800
and then just kind of attached it to a person as if I wouldn't notice

06:12.800 --> 06:16.400
I don't like that handshake but I think what I find even more upsetting

06:16.400 --> 06:20.080
is like the super firm like they gotta like dog

06:20.080 --> 06:23.840
like don't try oh I like that one don't try that fucking pickup artist bullshit

06:23.840 --> 06:27.120
with me I just shake my hand I can win that one

06:27.120 --> 06:30.640
so I like that yeah Travis is Travis has like extra knuckles

06:30.640 --> 06:34.160
inside of his hand his hand is like a I don't know it's

06:34.160 --> 06:38.160
bristling with knuckles on the inside the one I the the handshake I

06:38.160 --> 06:41.920
dislike the most is that one where you go over the handshake and their hand

06:41.920 --> 06:46.160
closes like a second too soon like some kind of awful claw game

06:46.160 --> 06:49.840
oh yeah just they grab like your fingers instead of like your palm

06:49.840 --> 06:52.640
yeah and then they get embarrassed and try and back out and it's like don't

06:52.640 --> 06:56.400
back out just like fix it just fix it just back out now

06:56.400 --> 06:59.520
this is what I'm gonna remember you by finger grabber handshake

06:59.520 --> 07:03.200
is like making love there's no standard for it you have to

07:03.200 --> 07:06.480
and you can get the presence from energy yeah

07:06.480 --> 07:10.560
you have to see where they're going with it you can get crabs from it

07:10.560 --> 07:14.960
you get all kinds of stuff this person is playing a dangerous fucking game

07:14.960 --> 07:17.760
because if you ever meet your counterpart in this world

07:17.760 --> 07:22.320
and you guys go in to shake hands and then both of you just grab hands

07:22.320 --> 07:26.960
and then stand perfectly still you are holding hands at that point

07:26.960 --> 07:31.120
that is cease to be a handshake you are holding hands if that's your boss

07:31.120 --> 07:34.800
that's a whole ordeal we got to call HR into the room HR please witness this

07:34.800 --> 07:37.680
this is just a shitty handshake we're not holding hands in the office

07:37.680 --> 07:42.800
on office hours okay but here's is I can I get this a little you don't pump

07:42.800 --> 07:46.800
you're not a pumper no but I I there's something to me that's

07:46.800 --> 07:49.520
always seemed so calculated and forced about the like

07:49.520 --> 07:54.240
handshake pump pump pump done there's something about like just a grab

07:54.240 --> 07:58.080
and kind of a like a almost like just a flex is all the pump you get where it's

07:58.080 --> 08:01.440
just like grab and like you're just kind of flexing

08:01.440 --> 08:03.600
your arm and then you break off and that you go

08:03.600 --> 08:06.720
you go into the you don't go up and down you go like in

08:06.720 --> 08:10.960
and you hit yeah you're walking like Voltron it's kind of just like a yeah

08:10.960 --> 08:14.080
put her that like a putter there yeah yeah yeah yeah

08:14.080 --> 08:17.280
which I kind of dig that way more because it's much more of just like an

08:17.280 --> 08:20.320
acknowledgement of like now our hands are together and now

08:20.320 --> 08:24.800
our hands are apart and there was no kind of extraneous motion in there I

08:24.800 --> 08:28.560
kind of dig that maybe but that said if the other person

08:28.560 --> 08:31.600
starts to pump you don't just like stare me and go

08:31.600 --> 08:35.600
don't leave them standing alone on pump island

08:35.600 --> 08:42.800
you've got to fucking send them a raft uh I want to ask one other quick favor

08:42.800 --> 08:46.720
since I know that this only applies to like people who do meet and greets after

08:46.720 --> 08:51.040
their live podcasts so this won't be widely useful uh but it

08:51.040 --> 08:54.320
I'm using our show as like a megaphone for

08:54.320 --> 08:58.000
my own wants and desires when you're at a thing

08:58.000 --> 09:03.040
and someone says hi I'm Justin McElroy and and you say yes I know

09:03.040 --> 09:06.000
that's incorrect

09:07.040 --> 09:10.480
wrong you wanged it you wanged it because I

09:10.480 --> 09:13.440
I know you know we're playing a game here you and I

09:16.560 --> 09:19.360
human you may not believe that but I do I want

09:19.360 --> 09:22.080
to know each and every one of you I wish I had the time after a live show to

09:22.080 --> 09:26.880

12:16.640 --> 12:19.920
and Barney diversion and Barney is my idol

12:19.920 --> 12:23.360
I was just wondering I'm in high secondary school

12:23.360 --> 12:29.600
but I am known for being the suit guy but I feel like I lose this in school

12:29.600 --> 12:33.120
how should I dress act and talk to become like Barney or in

12:33.120 --> 12:37.520
other words become legend wait for it fuck you let's do this

12:37.520 --> 12:42.880
question all right derp Barney is a fictional character fictional

12:42.880 --> 12:48.880
character I want to be Robinson Caruso did I say Caruso that's not his name

12:48.880 --> 12:55.200
he's a he's a caricature of a person uh in real life no one would like that

12:55.200 --> 12:59.200
no one would no one even likes him on the fucking show

12:59.200 --> 13:04.080
it's he's a punchline that's that's the thing is he's a goob

13:04.080 --> 13:08.320
he's not he's not a real person you already fucked up if you're in high

13:08.320 --> 13:12.160
school and you're the suit guy the suit guy is not a thing you want

13:12.160 --> 13:15.040
to be in high now that said if you're in high school and you wear a suit good for

13:15.040 --> 13:17.120
you I don't think anyone should ever be

13:17.120 --> 13:21.440
identified as the blank guy no not good for you Travis you said a

13:21.440 --> 13:24.400
bad thing don't wear no I don't want to judge listen if somebody

13:24.400 --> 13:26.720
wants to wear a suit if someone wants to wear

13:26.720 --> 13:30.240
a spider-man costume if somebody just wants to like roll out the school

13:30.240 --> 13:36.320
incorrect no no I'm done with the idea that people in

13:36.320 --> 13:38.960
high school should be making choices about their

13:38.960 --> 13:42.480
identity and everybody should just passively be okay with it listen

13:42.480 --> 13:46.480
you're still in your formative years okay I there's still a chance for me to

13:46.480 --> 13:49.440
help you you wear a suit to weddings and funerals

13:49.440 --> 13:52.880
stop it stop doing this you can wear a nice

13:52.880 --> 13:59.040
a nice pair of slacks um and a a polo or a button down

13:59.040 --> 14:02.560
if you want to elevate your fucking like jinko style

14:02.560 --> 14:06.400
I get it I get it go for it but there's what if I want to wear

14:06.400 --> 14:09.920
tearaway pants and a button-up dress shirt you mean like you

14:09.920 --> 14:13.680
you mean like you did every goddamn day just

14:13.680 --> 14:17.840
just as an example can I can I let me ask you a question real quick because

14:17.840 --> 14:19.920
you did that was not a joke you wore

14:19.920 --> 14:23.200
tearaway pants basically basically around the clock

14:23.200 --> 14:28.960
were you getting so much trim that you I did not first of all needed to have

14:28.960 --> 14:33.200
that first of all maybe once a week and it is

14:33.200 --> 14:36.080
because I was in fucking show choir on pussy day

14:36.080 --> 14:39.360
you mean they were comfy dance pants gotta be at the ready

14:39.360 --> 14:44.080
Minutemen Minutemen assemble I mean my balls get out of here I like I like that

14:44.080 --> 14:48.560
Travis's answer about uh uh meeting them for show choir was

14:48.560 --> 14:52.160
actually an implicit answer to Griffin's question about how much

14:52.160 --> 14:55.840
trim because that zero no no I don't know

14:55.840 --> 14:58.880
I was in show because my girlfriend was in show choir

14:58.880 --> 15:02.400
and you put on that sequin vest and you saying we built this city

15:02.400 --> 15:06.400
and just the city was the year before me Griffin my year was things

15:06.400 --> 15:13.680
got damp um we did more of like a Billy Joel

15:13.680 --> 15:19.600
uh kind of style like oh it just got 10 times better in the erotic

15:19.600 --> 15:23.040
actually I'm gonna I'm gonna hope against hope

15:23.040 --> 15:27.600
that you were doing that because it was in that the the few years that uh

15:27.600 --> 15:32.000
Billy Joel was married to one of uh Huntington's native daughters

15:32.000 --> 15:35.040
and you were hoping that maybe he would come by see

15:35.040 --> 15:38.800
Justin I live my life every second hoping Billy Joel comes by

15:38.800 --> 15:43.280
so here's here's just his body not like him driving into your office window god

15:43.280 --> 15:47.200
no here's a fun side story okay Billy Joel

15:47.200 --> 15:50.560
marries have to have told this story before no I don't well

15:50.560 --> 15:53.520
no I don't think so okay so Billy Joel married

15:53.520 --> 15:58.640
Katie Lee who is somebody that um I knew a little bit we did some shows together

15:58.640 --> 16:02.480
uh back in back in the day in the in the outdoor theater

16:02.480 --> 16:07.360
so he married Katie Lee who then goes on to she hosts the first

16:07.360 --> 16:09.600
season of Top Chef and she's done some other cookie shows

16:09.600 --> 16:13.200
whatever that was after this so Billy Joel marries Katie Lee

16:13.200 --> 16:17.360
and the the interesting thing about this is that it starts this like

16:17.360 --> 16:21.600
weird it's starting it starts this weird sort of like

16:21.600 --> 16:26.000
pseudo paranoia in Huntington that at any given moment Billy Joel could show up

16:26.000 --> 16:29.120
to something and it's more of like an expectant thing

16:29.120 --> 16:32.800
like a like a child whose parent has abandoned them

16:32.800 --> 16:35.440
that every time they're at like the science fair or something they have that

16:35.440 --> 16:37.440
like back of their head fantasy that maybe

16:37.440 --> 16:41.120
they heard about it and their erstwhile father will show up

16:41.120 --> 16:44.960
it was sort of like that with Billy Joel for a while anytime like a large house

16:44.960 --> 16:48.480
sold in Huntington the room room mill would fly and it was

16:48.480 --> 16:52.880
purchased by uh Dr. William Joel honorary uh and

16:52.880 --> 16:56.240
and and it was his that was his home that there was gonna live there was a

16:56.240 --> 16:59.440
bar on a home here that bar on 4th street that used to be

16:59.440 --> 17:03.120
club echo that it peaked at club echo but it would like rotate every maybe

17:03.120 --> 17:07.600
year and a half to become a different bar in the height of that fever it became

17:07.600 --> 17:11.840
cno piano bar and i think it fucking became that

17:11.840 --> 17:16.160
like expecting that maybe the jolster would cruise on through

17:16.160 --> 17:19.840
a piano bar hey why i just happen to know a piano man

17:19.840 --> 17:23.120
uh-huh billy just keep driving billy just well just once

17:23.120 --> 17:26.400
no we're going to chickadees stop it could it hurt we're going to

17:26.400 --> 17:29.440
we're going to stumblers to still stumbling we can't stop and see you know

17:29.440 --> 17:33.120
piano bar we left your tab open before we went to see a movie at the camelot and

17:33.120 --> 17:36.240
we said we'd be back and now we have to go back a lot of really great

17:36.240 --> 17:40.880
lot of really great references another question yeah uh years ago my two best

17:40.880 --> 17:43.760
friends who were dating had a wickedly ugly breakup which

17:43.760 --> 17:48.080
resulted in me having to choose sides i sided with my homeboy and broke contact

17:48.080 --> 17:50.880
completely with the other it's been six years and emotions have

17:50.880 --> 17:55.360
subsided so i decided to bury the proverbial hatchet and just make peace

17:55.360 --> 17:58.320
now she's inviting me to hang out as if nothing happened

17:58.320 --> 18:01.600
when i don't even really know this person anymore

18:01.600 --> 18:05.280
should i just accept that i open this pandora's box and jump back into things

18:05.280 --> 18:08.560
or should i go with my gut and tread carefully that's from critically

18:08.560 --> 18:12.800
confused in cranberry oh i feel

18:12.800 --> 18:16.160
i feel some real advice coming on this it's been a while

18:16.160 --> 18:20.320
uh-oh i know it's just like this is a thing that everybody i think has

18:20.320 --> 18:24.320
to deal with it's like a combined thing of having to choose sides when your

18:24.320 --> 18:28.480
friends break up is already pretty awful and it's unfair and it's

18:28.480 --> 18:31.840
something you shouldn't have to do but we all have to do it at some point

18:31.840 --> 18:39.600
um it is that combined with the like latent awkwardness of i haven't seen

18:39.600 --> 18:44.480
this person in years do we like

18:44.480 --> 18:48.160
making like the catch-up call to somebody that like you used to be really

18:48.160 --> 18:50.880
good friends with and then you haven't talked to

18:50.880 --> 18:55.280
uh is always like in your brain before you do it like the most going to be the

18:55.280 --> 19:00.080
most fucking uncomfortable thing ever because you have to ask them like

19:00.080 --> 19:04.960
what are you what are you well let me counter that though because i think that

19:04.960 --> 19:08.800
it's my i think the ideal way to do it is you

19:08.800 --> 19:11.680
kind of fake it till you make it kind of thing

19:11.680 --> 19:14.880
no well hear me out where you jump in like

19:14.880 --> 19:19.040
you know you just spoke the day before and then things kind of shake out where

19:19.040 --> 19:22.000
it's like okay great i'm noticing that this is

19:22.000 --> 19:24.320
different and this is different they like this now

19:24.320 --> 19:28.240
instead of like let's sit down and have a 30 minute intensive conversation about

19:28.240 --> 19:31.280
what's different in our lives no i think that's what you gotta do and

19:31.280 --> 19:33.520
i think that's worth it because you can't just be like

19:33.520 --> 19:36.400
you sit down hey hey it's good to see you you too should have done this a

19:36.400 --> 19:42.000
while ago yeah sure so how's work like now i've been in grad

19:42.000 --> 19:45.440
school for three years you fucked that one up next how's jimmy

19:45.440 --> 19:50.640
jimmy's jimmy's astronaut now jimmy's in space i i don't see jimmy anymore he's

19:50.640 --> 19:54.640
with the space men now he's a space jesus now how's your dog

19:54.640 --> 19:58.800
dog died next keep it up do you wanna i i hear the

19:58.800 --> 20:01.920
good are you saying that that's the ideal like that's what you have to do

20:01.920 --> 20:04.560
no i'm saying that's what you get when you fake it when you until you make it

20:04.560 --> 20:08.000
that's your strategy i sit down and i say let's just like

20:08.000 --> 20:12.320
fucking hash it out you play mario kart 8 and like you don't talk about shit you

20:12.320 --> 20:15.120
don't know the answer and then they leave and it's like oh fuck i forgot to

20:15.120 --> 20:16.960
ask anything about you because i don't know

20:16.960 --> 20:20.000
anything about you i guess our whole relationship we have to be playing

20:20.000 --> 20:23.120
mario kart 8 whenever you come over now shit that's kind of weird to me

20:23.120 --> 20:28.240
in this question uh i don't you said it's been six years and emotions

20:28.240 --> 20:31.680
subsided so you decided to bury the proverbial hatchet make peace

20:31.680 --> 20:36.080
what where does your homeboy figure into this what is his

20:36.080 --> 20:39.920
like did you ask his blessing before burying this this hat i don't think you

20:39.920 --> 20:42.640
need to six years is a long fucking time six

20:42.640 --> 20:45.600
years is a really long time how bad were these emotions at

20:45.600 --> 20:50.720
six years yeah i mean it could not be it couldn't be that it could just be like

20:50.720 --> 20:54.240
you stopped hanging out with this person and when you do that like they left your

20:54.240 --> 20:57.680
mind's eye and you didn't like think to do this i'm

20:57.680 --> 21:02.400
saying it's always worth it to like to try and

21:02.400 --> 21:06.000
reconnect with a person like it's always so great because then you have like

21:06.000 --> 21:09.280
one of your old friends is back it's always like the best thing

21:09.280 --> 21:12.320
ever it's just like broaching that subject is always really rough i think

21:12.320 --> 21:14.560
you have to be like really open about it like

21:14.560 --> 21:17.920
hey we lost touch and that sucked let's just like

21:17.920 --> 21:22.000
just run through it let's this hangout is going to be us like fucking

21:22.000 --> 21:25.280
getting through the past six years and then the next time we hang out it can be

21:25.280 --> 21:29.200
just like what did you do this you will honestly you will be surprised how

21:29.200 --> 21:32.880
quickly you can wrap up the important things in six years it's easy and like

21:32.880 --> 21:35.840
they're doing it they want to do it too i'm with you guys on this they don't

21:35.840 --> 21:39.840
know what you've been up to like they're in the same boat like because

21:39.840 --> 21:43.760
in any in any relationship communication is key right like that's the thing

21:43.760 --> 21:48.080
so i changed my mind how because here's the thing if you really are going to

21:48.080 --> 21:50.880
re-establish a a true friendship with this person you

21:50.880 --> 21:52.960
were best friends before this all shook out

21:52.960 --> 21:56.640
and now you're looking to like rebuild that i think it's perfectly justified

21:56.640 --> 21:59.520
would be like hey i feel like you know we really grew apart in

21:59.520 --> 22:03.840
that six years and we lost contact so what's up but you know let's

22:03.840 --> 22:07.600
let's catch up i would find it so flattering i would find it so flattering

22:07.600 --> 22:10.480
that like you want to put in the effort to like

22:10.480 --> 22:13.360
the like this relationship meant something to us at some point like it

22:13.360 --> 22:17.600
really means a lot to me that you want to like work to to get us back

22:17.600 --> 22:20.720
to where we were like i don't know man i think it's i think

22:20.720 --> 22:23.760
it's super it's super nice and it's something like i'm

22:23.760 --> 22:26.240
i'm dishing it out but like it's something i struggle with i've been going

22:26.240 --> 22:30.320
to a lot of weddings this year and like reconnecting with like my literally my

22:30.320 --> 22:33.040
oldest dearest friends that i'm just like such a

22:33.040 --> 22:37.120
shithead about you know calling once a month or so

22:37.120 --> 22:41.440
um i i think the more that you do it i think i feel like that's a big part of

22:41.440 --> 22:46.080
becoming an adult is like realizing that everybody that you

22:46.080 --> 22:49.440
were friends with in school coming up have also become

22:49.440 --> 22:53.360
adults and it's so fucking cool to like talk to

22:53.360 --> 22:57.280
them and see like how you guys have how you guys

22:57.280 --> 23:01.200
have developed things broke bad but most of the time

23:01.200 --> 23:04.640
they're not gonna get weird the nature problem with these

23:04.640 --> 23:09.760
conversations this is why it's such a like this is why a lot of times in my

23:09.760 --> 23:12.560
life i will avoid these conversations because

23:12.560 --> 23:17.760
i'm so afraid of saying to the person like

23:17.760 --> 23:22.320
so how is this person that i sort of kind of remember from your family

23:22.320 --> 23:26.400
and they're dead and like that's i can't even process that

23:26.400 --> 23:30.800
like this is not a goof like i i'm i worry enough about that that

23:30.800 --> 23:34.880
that i will actually avoid conversations like this because i i i am so paranoid

23:34.880 --> 23:38.800
about i i think it's honestly just like looking

23:38.800 --> 23:42.560
stupid because i don't think people would be like upset

23:42.560 --> 23:45.600
angry at you like i i'm just worried about looking

23:45.600 --> 23:49.200
dumb in front of a person and saying like the stupidest thing

23:49.200 --> 23:52.720
but geez isn't that like a litmus test where if the person's like

23:52.720 --> 23:56.640
uh they're dead and you're like okay so's this friendship

23:56.640 --> 24:00.400
like where that person's gonna judge you for not knowing this thing because you

24:00.400 --> 24:04.080
haven't spoken anxiety isn't really rooted in

24:04.080 --> 24:07.360
like social anxiety especially isn't really rooted in

24:07.360 --> 24:11.360
the realities of the situation because almost with all of these like the worst

24:11.360 --> 24:15.120
like people are usually very sort of like generous and kind about

24:15.120 --> 24:17.840
conversation that's the thing you have to like

24:17.840 --> 24:20.880
concretely remind yourself of but but you know

24:20.880 --> 24:24.560
it's not really rooted in the realities of how they're going to react it's like

24:24.560 --> 24:27.840
yeah it's just that's just the paranoia start start general

24:27.840 --> 24:31.600
like i i start with like so what do you like what are you doing now like where

24:31.600 --> 24:33.840
do you live that's a good one like where do you live

24:33.840 --> 24:36.800
and what do you do there is a good way to like start out and then

24:36.800 --> 24:40.720
like you get your feet wet from there don't start with who in your family

24:40.720 --> 24:45.200
died this year like that and don't and try to say general i think don't ask

24:45.200 --> 24:47.200
like are you still really into deep blue

24:47.200 --> 24:50.320
something because i seem to remember you being very into that band

24:50.320 --> 24:53.120
sure and what if their answer is yes i'm a groupie for them

24:53.120 --> 24:57.040
hi they let me in the band i'm in the band i hand job to all all of them

24:57.040 --> 25:00.400
yes could you just throw out like how's your family and then

25:00.400 --> 25:03.840
let them fill in the blanks as they feel comfortable with that's like as

25:03.840 --> 25:06.640
opposed to like well as opposed to like how's your dad

25:06.640 --> 25:09.360
doing how's your brother who had all those

25:09.360 --> 25:14.560
risky tendencies keep it keep it real keep it real real general i think and

25:14.560 --> 25:17.120
and a lot of people in your life that's gonna like

25:17.120 --> 25:20.240
whatever they tell you is probably going to be a pretty good indication of who

25:20.240 --> 25:22.800
they are and then you can move on from there but it's it's

25:22.800 --> 25:26.080
it's hard and it gets harder the longer you go without

25:26.080 --> 25:29.680
talking but man like i never get off a phone call

25:29.680 --> 25:32.640
with one of my friends that i haven't talked to in a few months without feeling

25:32.640 --> 25:36.800
like fucking awesome about it yeah um

25:36.800 --> 25:39.760
you're right griff i need to just get over and just do that more just because

25:39.760 --> 25:42.720
it really feels kind of like finding a time capsule we were like oh yeah

25:42.720 --> 25:45.120
there's all this awesome stuff i forgot about

25:45.120 --> 25:49.040
yeah and you think i i think this is one of the problems with like

25:49.040 --> 25:51.840
i've really turned a corner on twitter and facebook i kind of think they're the

25:51.840 --> 25:56.400
fucking worst now um and i think it's because like you

25:56.400 --> 25:59.920
follow your friends on there and you see pictures of like the food that they

25:59.920 --> 26:03.520
eat in the vacations that they take and you think like

26:03.520 --> 26:06.800
man i really know what this guy's up to now

26:06.800 --> 26:11.040
but you fucking don't like you gotta call them and you need to like actually have

26:11.040 --> 26:14.960
a human conversation with them and then you will and then you'll know

26:14.960 --> 26:17.680
you trick it social media is like a way of tricking yourself into thinking you're

26:17.680 --> 26:19.440
staying in really good touch with their friends

26:19.440 --> 26:22.640
but really you're just like a creepy voyeur of their the

26:22.640 --> 26:26.320
meals that they eat well i but i will say this i think the one thing that

26:26.320 --> 26:30.880
facebook really does well for me is even if it's not

26:30.880 --> 26:36.000
deep it at least keeps in my mind's eye like hey you haven't talked to jordan in

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
a while and it's like oh yeah you know what you're

26:38.000 --> 26:42.320
right i haven't i don't know it's like you can if you see

26:42.320 --> 26:46.000
someone coming up that you know they haven't talked in a

26:46.000 --> 26:48.160
long time you can sort of hide in their periphery

26:48.160 --> 26:51.280
as you check their facebook and there is also that

26:51.280 --> 26:54.480
get get a few sort of ground things grounders

26:54.480 --> 26:58.160
i call them yeah a few easy ones you can ask about because yeah then you always

26:58.160 --> 27:00.880
have the hey i saw on facebook that you just got a new puppy

27:00.880 --> 27:04.400
how's that going and then you've got weird things

27:04.400 --> 27:08.000
i don't know now i say that i would say no don't say that out loud no that

27:08.000 --> 27:10.560
seems like hey i know we haven't talked in six years but i

27:10.560 --> 27:13.760
looked at oh i still watch but isn't that completely socially

27:13.760 --> 27:16.720
accepted at this point that people look at your facebook all like

27:16.720 --> 27:20.320
hey the reason i follow you on facebook is so i know this shit it's not like

27:20.320 --> 27:24.880
but it's not like you're nsa hacking them like no

27:24.880 --> 27:28.400
i prismed you and it looks like you're really happy with that new man

27:28.400 --> 27:32.080
i guess it might be naive of me to say this but i would like to think that if

27:32.080 --> 27:36.160
you were close with this person they they might be feeling the same

27:36.160 --> 27:39.520
thing and saying like hey i don't want this to be awkward but

27:39.520 --> 27:43.760
it's been so long since we talked let's just like get down to it i i mean

27:43.760 --> 27:46.640
i would like to think that would be the best way to approach it i know

27:46.640 --> 27:49.280
that's completely different from how i started

27:49.280 --> 27:52.720
yeah we changed we changed minds together just yeah but it's like you know

27:52.720 --> 27:56.400
what just like be real and if they were really your friend and

27:56.400 --> 27:58.960
if that's really a connection you want to rebuild

27:58.960 --> 28:02.720
then rebuild it and sometimes that takes work and sometimes that work

28:02.720 --> 28:06.800
is this is scary it's going on too long i love you

28:06.800 --> 28:10.880
i got it it's taking forever it's just that i miss you get it i feel like we

28:10.880 --> 28:13.040
never talk we get it we just never talk and i miss you

28:13.040 --> 28:17.360
get it we get it we get it whatever you have to we get it

28:17.360 --> 28:24.000
okay i get your whole thing i get it you're just wrong

28:24.560 --> 28:27.680
we we just did like 30 minutes on that question we were wrong the whole time

28:27.680 --> 28:32.240
you didn't say anything i just got i got bored enough that all i

28:32.240 --> 28:34.640
just did i just think you feel like you're wrong

28:34.640 --> 28:38.000
i feel like no right answer should take that long to explain

28:38.000 --> 28:41.600
i feel like the easier the the simpler answer is usually the right one isn't

28:41.600 --> 28:46.080
that what ockham's razor is yeah i think ockham's razor is from harrys.com

28:46.080 --> 28:48.720
check out harrys.com for all your shaving needs

28:48.720 --> 28:53.920
bitch we're not doing they didn't pay for that edit that out bleep that

28:54.080 --> 28:57.760
no i'm just using a harry's razor right now so i thought about it can we talk

28:57.760 --> 29:00.880
they're not bad they're pretty good can we talk about the companies that did

29:00.880 --> 29:12.240
give us money to talk about the product

29:12.240 --> 29:15.760
problem with doing ads for major companies

29:15.760 --> 29:19.520
is that you get all this money and you don't have anywhere to put it

29:19.520 --> 29:24.000
it is such an issue i deal with it every day i deal with it every day we insist

29:24.000 --> 29:28.880
all of our uh payments come in quarters yeah so have you seen hoarders it's kind

29:28.880 --> 29:30.960
of like that have you seen a show of hoarders have you

29:30.960 --> 29:35.040
seen quarter hoarders what what's the show called quarter hoarders

29:35.040 --> 29:41.680
you're saying quota quota hoda it's called hodor hoarders

29:42.000 --> 29:45.280
i got all these piles of hodors what do i do with them

29:45.280 --> 29:50.080
well you can put them in simple.com you can go to simple.com and put your giant men

29:50.080 --> 29:54.000
deposit all your giant men at simple.com the way banking should be

29:54.000 --> 29:57.040
they're rebuilding banking from the ground up if you don't

29:57.040 --> 30:00.560
that you can spend without stress if you don't know if you have enough hodors

30:00.560 --> 30:05.680
in the bank you can spend them simple simple is the only other word that hodor

30:05.680 --> 30:08.080
knows that's how good a product it is that's

30:08.080 --> 30:10.880
how good it is yeah save automatically you have a goal i want

30:10.880 --> 30:14.080
to have a thousand hodors by the end of this year

30:14.080 --> 30:17.040
simple will tell you how many hodors you need to save it'll do it

30:17.040 --> 30:22.240
for you it'll put it aside for you um that's good because i these hodors are

30:22.240 --> 30:26.560
just burning a hole in my pocket you can actually deposit hodors from

30:26.560 --> 30:29.520
your phone now here's the way that works you take a picture of it

30:29.520 --> 30:33.040
and then you and then they scan it and they say okay that one counts and then

30:33.040 --> 30:36.640
you burn it yeah you burn that in your account he's

30:36.640 --> 30:40.400
gonna be scared of the of the fire and the technology the

30:40.400 --> 30:43.600
whole process is not going to be great for the hodor but you've got to

30:43.600 --> 30:48.240
digitize them you got to uh it's just like tron uh it's

30:48.240 --> 30:52.240
they're instant free transfers between your different simple accounts

30:52.240 --> 30:56.480
for when you forget to pay your roommates for that cheetos bag

30:56.480 --> 31:00.480
i don't know i think i mean bag of cheetos it says bag of cheetos

31:00.480 --> 31:05.040
okay so in our copy it says that cheetos bag i'm assuming we're talking about a

31:05.040 --> 31:09.200
bag of cheetos they're not selling collectible cheeto

31:09.200 --> 31:13.040

31:25.600 --> 31:28.800
when you have to pay your roommate for that cheetos bag what is there

31:28.800 --> 31:33.280
okay the banking solution they have come up with is arguably the greatest banking

31:33.280 --> 31:36.080
solution on earth oh they've solved banking they

31:36.080 --> 31:40.160
fixed banking but it sounds like their whole situation

31:40.160 --> 31:44.160
maybe their home life is not so great i mean it also says

31:44.160 --> 31:48.320
pay your bills fast before your hot pocket is done microwaving

31:48.320 --> 31:51.520
they uh yeah and they've also imagined a sort of

alternative we're all you know what here here is a fucking fact

40:42.640 --> 40:47.360
for you dear listeners that will shock you and there has never been

40:47.360 --> 40:50.800
an advertiser that has pulled their advertising from

40:50.800 --> 40:54.800
our show nope uh and i think we keep pushing it just to

40:54.800 --> 40:58.640
like we keep walking the line because i think we kind of deep down want that

40:58.640 --> 41:01.360
eventually like we want that to happen we're trying

41:01.360 --> 41:04.640
to be controversial like we really are i don't think they

41:04.640 --> 41:08.080
listen that's what that or it's some kind of

41:08.080 --> 41:13.200
like weird shaming thing where they're like we do deserve

41:13.200 --> 41:19.920
advertising as uh masochism apparently sure hey ross

41:19.920 --> 41:23.440
hey carrie hey it's me your co-host oh yeah we have a show don't we have a

41:23.440 --> 41:26.400
show oh no ross and carrie it's about

41:26.400 --> 41:28.560
undercover investigations of fringe groups

41:28.560 --> 41:32.800
yeah like the toni olamo ministries cult yep that's led by a pedophile

41:32.800 --> 41:38.400
he's in jail he's in jail also we became mormons we became raelians

41:38.400 --> 41:41.520
which is a ufo group that's right we joined the ordo templi

41:41.520 --> 41:45.360
orientis yes the 911 truthers we got cupped we got

41:45.360 --> 41:48.560
acupunctured we got rakey we've pretty much anything that you've

41:48.560 --> 41:52.000
heard of and been like that doesn't sound quite right we've done

41:52.000 --> 41:55.840
that so you don't have to do it so if you want to hear about this and

41:55.840 --> 42:01.040
you should then go to maximum fun dot org

42:03.360 --> 42:06.720
uh this yahoo was sent in by tanner thank you tanner it's by yahoo answers

42:06.720 --> 42:10.800
user naomi who asks i got baptized then smoked

42:10.800 --> 42:14.880
weed a day later and this happened i got baptized on

42:14.880 --> 42:19.040
wednesday then smoked some weed well reggie

42:19.040 --> 42:22.560
is that like a brand of nickname is that like a strain

42:22.560 --> 42:27.600
hold on i'll hook it up you guys go on i'm on that reginald

42:27.600 --> 42:32.720
on thursday on that val johnson i'm on that reginald val johnson

42:32.720 --> 42:38.720
on thursday i've smoked okay fuck this question no punctuation i got

42:38.720 --> 42:42.560
baptized on wednesday then i smoked that sweet dank reginald val johnson on

42:42.560 --> 42:46.800
thursday i've smoked before so it wasn't new to

42:46.800 --> 42:51.600
me and then it says in d

42:51.920 --> 42:57.520
which is like maybe a typo maybe they meant to say in bd like no big deal

42:57.520 --> 43:00.640
so at first i was feeling good just chilling

43:00.640 --> 43:05.120
then like 40 minutes later i got in the car and was going to drive home but

43:05.120 --> 43:10.880
everything went right then black and then another in d

43:10.880 --> 43:18.000
i couldn't see i drove over a curve curb and got really dizzy and threw up

43:18.000 --> 43:21.440
after that i was a little high and felt pretty much sober

43:21.440 --> 43:25.120
but that had never happened to me before i've smoked

43:25.120 --> 43:28.960
way more than that before and not long ago from that day

43:28.960 --> 43:33.040
so i don't know what happened any clues

43:33.040 --> 43:37.200
just to clarify reggie is like regular like street grade

43:37.200 --> 43:39.520
weed

43:44.000 --> 43:46.880
that's uh that sucks because reginald val johnson

43:46.880 --> 43:53.040
is far from a regular street grade actor no he is definitely top quality he is

43:53.040 --> 43:59.360
that is dank kush prime kush is this person's theory that had

43:59.360 --> 44:02.640
they not been baptized this wouldn't have happened but because they were

44:02.640 --> 44:05.520
baptized jesus looked down and said like oh

44:05.520 --> 44:08.960
smoking weed a can't do that you got smoked them you

44:08.960 --> 44:13.840
gotten sanctified waters and that will blend

44:13.840 --> 44:17.680
with that good good reginald cannabis inside your body

44:17.680 --> 44:22.400
that dank dank kush and it's going to create a chemical reaction in your body

44:22.400 --> 44:26.480
that is going to be a fucking like visceral experience

44:26.480 --> 44:30.800
oh so it's like it's a cross like bong water and holy water together

44:30.800 --> 44:34.560
gonna fuck you up not like jesus was like no more weed for you

44:34.560 --> 44:38.640
no i mean there's a purely scientific reason for it sanctified water

44:38.640 --> 44:45.520
plus val johnson tight tight smoke in your lungs i feel like enough

44:45.520 --> 44:51.600
time passes between the introduction of the fact that this person got

44:51.600 --> 44:56.640
baptized and the end of the question that it almost takes on sort of a a

44:56.640 --> 45:01.600
checkoff's gun uh uh veneer so that you don't you

45:01.600 --> 45:04.640
aren't actively thinking about it and maybe that's the twist

45:04.640 --> 45:08.400
it's like you're it gives you long enough to sort of forget about it and

45:08.400 --> 45:12.400
then so when it pops back up you're like oh that makes perfect sense so maybe

45:12.400 --> 45:14.960
this question i sort of literally did not remember

45:14.960 --> 45:18.640
the baptism part and when people circle back around on it oh

45:18.640 --> 45:22.000
actually now that you mentioned that baptism i've forgotten i call that i

45:22.000 --> 45:25.520
call that trope burke's law because that was every episode of burke's

45:25.520 --> 45:28.880
law well they fucking show you they give you

45:28.880 --> 45:30.800
all the clues that you need to solve the mystery

45:30.800 --> 45:33.840
it's right there at the beginning especially if you're 75

45:33.840 --> 45:37.440
if you're 75 years old you're gonna figure it out it is slylock fox level

45:37.440 --> 45:41.440
difficulty um we can agree that this person had

45:41.440 --> 45:45.360
an embolism right or i don't think that that is what happened

45:45.360 --> 45:49.200
i think that i am a huge advocate for not a huge

45:49.200 --> 45:51.760
advocate i don't actually for smoking weed and driving

45:51.760 --> 45:56.880
i support no i support no i no no i support the legalization of marijuana

45:56.880 --> 46:01.040
pretty broadly these are helpful reminders i think

46:01.040 --> 46:06.160
i think is a is a helpful reminder that not just the smart people get to

46:06.160 --> 46:08.800
purchase legal weed there are going to be some people that

46:08.800 --> 46:12.640
get baptized and then get super reggie high the next day and then

46:12.640 --> 46:14.560
think you know what i'm going to motor on over

46:14.560 --> 46:20.320
to a destination of my choice in a car a heavy one too a real heavy the heaviest

46:20.320 --> 46:24.160
car i can find i'm just gonna get get to driving in the

46:24.160 --> 46:27.920
heaviest car i can find i'm a little high but i'm mostly over puke

46:27.920 --> 46:31.920
should i take the smart car nah i'll go with the homer

46:31.920 --> 46:35.440
is it possible that the original val johnson was was laced with a little

46:35.440 --> 46:37.760
urkel

46:39.280 --> 46:43.040
i'm on that urk i'm on that jaleel i mean just like a

46:43.040 --> 46:46.400
five percent urk mix you know what i mean just enough you're like yeah i feel

46:46.400 --> 46:48.640
fine but then you introduce like a bunch of

46:48.640 --> 46:52.880
moving objects in your rear view mirror and suddenly blackout puke puke puke

46:52.880 --> 46:56.960
you said you were selling the reggie this is this is fucking richie

46:56.960 --> 47:00.960
this is bullshit i paid top dollar richie was a character on that show

47:00.960 --> 47:04.080
little yeah he was the little kid he was the littlest richie

47:04.080 --> 47:12.240
um guys is it cool to like when he got baptized did he not be like

47:12.240 --> 47:19.040
as part of this ritual i promise to you jesus that i'm not gonna

47:19.040 --> 47:23.440
do as much weed smoking i'm gonna give you like a 24 hour

47:23.440 --> 47:29.600
window of just like blissing out on these holy waters i don't think jesus

47:29.600 --> 47:35.040
gives two shits either way i guess not but this guy obviously

47:35.040 --> 47:40.400
thinks that there's a connection there because he has smoked this reggie on

47:40.400 --> 47:45.840
the reg on the reg so like reggie on the reg this has never

47:45.840 --> 47:48.240
happened to him before and he seems like the kind of person

47:48.240 --> 47:52.000
that smokes a lot of weed he seemed like an informed scientist

47:52.000 --> 47:55.200
he's taken notes and a complex journey which is what makes me think that this

47:55.200 --> 47:59.920
reaction transcends science i don't know guys i think there

47:59.920 --> 48:03.440
might be a little uh i think i think you might have gotten

48:03.440 --> 48:07.760
touched by angel this week on divine intervention

48:07.760 --> 48:10.800
maybe i've watched that show by the way makes you think

48:10.800 --> 48:14.080
have you listened to the bim bam yeah that podcast makes me think

48:14.080 --> 48:17.760
and that's why i like it i wonder if this person got to the end of writing

48:17.760 --> 48:21.840
this question and thought what am i doing

48:21.840 --> 48:27.520
what what am i doing here i i don't think there's even a question

48:27.520 --> 48:31.840
what am i doing i think we're just a weird story i'm telling

48:31.840 --> 48:36.400
i feel like i'm telling a weird story i don't know what the response would be

48:36.400 --> 48:41.040
or who could respond to and i have to get ready for work as vice president of

48:41.040 --> 48:44.720
the united states of america

48:44.720 --> 48:48.720
i got another question for you guys i'm getting married next may

48:48.720 --> 48:51.680
while planning the celebration has been a breeze my fiancé

48:51.680 --> 48:55.600
and i have hit on one point of conflict whether to have a wedding cake

48:55.600 --> 48:58.720
or go non-traditional to have a wedding pie

48:58.720 --> 49:03.520
if i can get you brothers on my side maybe my big day will have that extra

49:03.520 --> 49:07.920
berry filling to put it over the top that's from fearfully frosted in

49:07.920 --> 49:10.400
philadelphia now you can't see this at home

49:10.400 --> 49:15.200
but uh the f from fearfully frosted has been translated

49:15.200 --> 49:18.480
to replace the ph in philadelphia oh that's fine

49:18.480 --> 49:21.360
can i tell you something choose i love the way that you say the word fiancé you

49:21.360 --> 49:24.400
sound like john malkovich's character in rounders

49:24.400 --> 49:27.440
when you say like trying to say fancy yeah

49:27.440 --> 49:35.360
fancy um um chick chick chick let's all

49:35.360 --> 49:38.640
simultaneously do our teddy kgb impressions

49:38.640 --> 49:46.160
chick you give some money money that was my favorite i we're a cake

49:46.160 --> 49:52.000
family damn it um this this used to be like the big

49:52.000 --> 49:55.360
point for i feel like we had again have to have talked about this on the show

49:55.360 --> 49:59.600
like uh we used to have like brutal fights

49:59.600 --> 50:04.880
about whether cake or pie was better um

50:04.880 --> 50:09.040
i feel like i feel like wedding traditions in our generation have been

50:09.040 --> 50:13.120
all but phased out yeah at this point don't you think i

50:13.120 --> 50:15.840
think that the idea of doing something because it's traditional

50:15.840 --> 50:19.200
is the wrong reason to do anything if you're saying

50:19.200 --> 50:24.720
i want pie and my fiancé wants cake that's a much different discussion then

50:24.720 --> 50:28.720
we both want to have pie but he's worried about breaking i actually feel

50:28.720 --> 50:31.280
like the commerce the conversation about whether or

50:31.280 --> 50:35.760
not to have cake or pie at x event is more important than the

50:35.760 --> 50:39.840
conversation as to whether or not it's important at a wedding just the

50:39.840 --> 50:42.320
general question is the is the thing you need to be worried

50:42.320 --> 50:44.800
about whether cake or pie is more delicious

50:44.800 --> 50:47.920
right and we can't get into this we could let me throw this out

50:47.920 --> 50:51.280
both yeah what have a groom's a groom's pie

50:51.280 --> 50:55.360
yeah you know at our wedding we did uh like cheesecake bites

50:55.360 --> 51:00.160
because we love cheesecake and that was the way we went with it and then

51:00.160 --> 51:03.280
and it was kind of that well but not what i would have guessed well here's the

51:03.280 --> 51:07.360
point of the story is that we were worried about it going in

51:07.360 --> 51:09.680
like oh is this weird because we're not going to

51:09.680 --> 51:13.200
have like you know the traditional like three-tiered cake or whatever

51:13.200 --> 51:16.560
and then it was one of the things that people talked about most of like

51:16.560 --> 51:20.320
i love that that was so cute and so you guys and blah blah blah it's functional

51:20.320 --> 51:23.200
too and i have to worry about like fucking like waiting

51:23.200 --> 51:28.720
my turn to get like a person who didn't want to be there to like

51:28.720 --> 51:32.960
cut me off a big old chunk is the chunk too big i can't eat all this but i have

51:32.960 --> 51:36.080
to also feel guilty is it too small and i have to go wait and fucking

51:36.080 --> 51:38.480
line again and yeah we just set out like cake

51:38.480 --> 51:41.280
plates on each table with cheesecake on them it was

51:41.280 --> 51:44.880
it was pretty brilliant if i say so myself but if you guys want to do pie do

51:44.880 --> 51:48.000
pie if you want to do cake and pie do cake

51:48.000 --> 51:51.680
and pie if you want to do a pie cake shut up that's not a fucking thing

51:51.680 --> 51:55.200
if you want to do ice cream cake if you want ice cream cake at your wedding

51:55.200 --> 52:00.640
fuck it that sounds awesome go to dq throw them on the table go to fucking dq

52:00.640 --> 52:04.560
and get some blizzards and then wedding blizzards if you want

52:04.560 --> 52:08.560
wedding chicken strip baskets go for it this they got that texas toast

52:08.560 --> 52:14.320
i as part of my vows will now feed you a dilly bar

52:14.320 --> 52:20.320
i gotta say travel i drove your uh your cheesecakes to the event that

52:20.320 --> 52:24.080
was my contribution is i went and picked up your cheesecakes

52:24.080 --> 52:29.520
and i don't know that i've ever been so excited as when i

52:29.520 --> 52:32.240
had four cheesecakes stacked up on a passenger seat knew that i was going to

52:32.240 --> 52:36.560

on sunday morning uh the day of the morning of my brother's wedding which

52:57.920 --> 53:01.200
was kind of a weird experience for me i was the most dressed up anyone's ever

53:01.200 --> 53:05.200
been inside a cheesecake factory ever um felt a little bit out of place a little

53:05.200 --> 53:08.800
bit fish out of water was that before or after i made you drive

53:08.800 --> 53:11.360
back to my house to get my special Travis made us get

53:11.360 --> 53:14.640
his special wedding night underwear and i had to look at them

53:14.640 --> 53:18.800
i had to get them i had to get them from the underwear spot

53:18.800 --> 53:21.760
where he kept all of the things and i had to get it

53:21.760 --> 53:25.440
and i touched them to yeah they acknowledged that they i had to

53:25.440 --> 53:28.720
i had to okay here's the order i learned about them

53:28.720 --> 53:32.640
i said that's terrible then i learned that i would have to retrieve touch

53:32.640 --> 53:39.920
no feel believe hold grasp acknowledge become

53:39.920 --> 53:43.280
embrace absorb and now you guys are doing that at home

53:43.280 --> 53:46.960
they were silky as fuck no they were silky and they were black

53:46.960 --> 53:50.160
and they were kind of black just a little bit sheer just a little

53:50.160 --> 53:54.160
bit sheer so i just just like i'm a little bit dead now i acknowledged that

54:08.480 --> 54:10.960
bride to be had to think had to learn a lot about

54:10.960 --> 54:14.640
traps more of an impulse buy it was a lot more of an impulse buy where i

54:14.640 --> 54:17.760
looked and i said you know that's gonna feel real good i had to learn a lot

54:17.760 --> 54:21.920
about Teresa that i didn't know and the things that she prefers

54:21.920 --> 54:27.520

impulse buy the the decision to send your brother

to go get your special wedding and it was malicious

55:10.480 --> 55:14.160
