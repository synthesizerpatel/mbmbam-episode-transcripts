00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists. He's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:29.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.660 --> 00:50.660
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.940 --> 00:55.940
It's better it's better with you

01:00.180 --> 01:02.180
Better it's better

01:11.140 --> 01:17.080
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother brother and me and if I show for the modern era

01:17.080 --> 01:21.360
I'm your oldest brother Justin the flamingo McElroy

01:22.100 --> 01:25.160
Hello, I'm Travis the biggest dog

01:25.840 --> 01:29.940
McElroy the middle this brother woof woof. It's Griffin. Hi

01:30.680 --> 01:32.680
Hello

01:32.720 --> 01:37.360
It's such a delight to talk to you griff. We haven't talked since your you got a new son

01:37.360 --> 01:43.160
I got one. I got a I'd put it. I did a pre-order on a new son and

01:43.160 --> 01:47.740
Yeah, I got a brand new son. I got great pre-order bonuses

01:48.360 --> 01:54.480
Like see I decided to wait until they could fix all the bugs. Yeah, but this one's got a

01:55.520 --> 01:57.520
glitch or two

01:58.040 --> 02:04.520
Yeah, this one's got this one's got a few it needs a little bit more QA, you know what I'm saying

02:05.400 --> 02:10.040
vis-a-vis diaper stuff, but we're all happy to be here. A couple leaks

02:10.040 --> 02:14.200
There's been a few leaks to the press on this one

02:14.200 --> 02:18.340
And no, I just love them two bits and I'm just really

02:19.160 --> 02:25.840
I'm stoked. I'm stoked to be here stoked for you guys had a great episode last week. That was big and then

02:26.800 --> 02:30.920
You know yahoo set my fucking house on fire with me and my family inside of it

02:31.640 --> 02:33.280
Yeah, which was cool with them

02:33.280 --> 02:41.080
Like I was like, I just got the kid to sleep and he saw him dreaming having smiles and what's he dreaming about?

02:41.080 --> 02:42.840
I don't know cuz he doesn't fucking know anything

02:42.840 --> 02:47.360
So like I was thinking about that and the and then yahoo came and burned my house down

02:47.360 --> 02:49.360
And I thought that that was pretty fucked up

02:50.240 --> 02:54.640
Personally speaking they what I mean, I can't I don't want to make too much for the thing out of it

02:54.640 --> 02:58.960
But you definitely know that they were waiting until they knew yeah, sure

02:58.960 --> 03:03.720
No question hard for it not to feel targeted. Yeah, it feels very targeted

03:03.720 --> 03:08.960
like I don't know how at least I guess I talked about it on the podcast that you know that I was gonna be out the

03:08.960 --> 03:10.960
following week and then

03:11.160 --> 03:15.320
Marissa is that the yahoo I get or did Verizon do it?

03:15.440 --> 03:19.960
Was it the can you hear me now guy? Who the fuck do I need to like intimidate?

03:20.560 --> 03:22.560
To stop this thing

03:22.560 --> 03:29.440
Because I'm not done like I'm not done fighting if you think I am that you because this is your first episode listening to my brother

03:29.440 --> 03:35.200
My brother I mean Griffin is getting to vote every waking moment from this point on. Yeah, he's got nothing

03:35.200 --> 03:41.600
He's clear to schedule. Yeah, and what's great about it is that I have a lot more waking moments now

03:42.080 --> 03:44.920
Than I did, you know a couple weeks ago

03:45.680 --> 03:48.200
So I'm not fucking kidding. I

03:48.200 --> 03:52.120
I I don't know what I don't know what it looks like

03:52.720 --> 03:56.240
This this campaign. I've never really done one like this before

03:57.240 --> 04:02.120
I mean there was that one time I tried to get the show ed back on the air and I

04:03.880 --> 04:07.240
Cuz it that was the only shit made me happy and

04:08.000 --> 04:12.320
For that one you asked that everyone send a bowling alley to NBC

04:12.320 --> 04:18.100
Every that was the first step and the second step is they had to change their everybody legally changed their names to Ed

04:18.120 --> 04:20.280
But one word like Prince

04:21.040 --> 04:22.480
anyway

04:22.480 --> 04:27.640
I'm just so fucking happy to be here guys. You did a great episode last week. Oh, thanks Griff

04:27.840 --> 04:32.920
We recorded that, you know a couple years back, but it was nice to finally get it out there. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

04:33.120 --> 04:36.320
I have a I have a bit of a big announcement to you

04:36.320 --> 04:43.200
Yeah, well, it's come to my attention that and this is gonna really be hard for you guys

04:43.200 --> 04:46.000
There's gonna be a shock for you guys to hear. This is feeling like a bit

04:46.880 --> 04:48.880
No, no, no that that

04:49.520 --> 04:53.200
Apparently there are some folks out there who don't think

04:53.960 --> 04:55.040
that

04:55.040 --> 04:57.680
Sad lives and riddle me piss

04:58.560 --> 05:01.520
And and play along at home are funny. All right. All right

05:01.520 --> 05:06.040
And so I decided and this is hard to say but to temporarily

05:07.640 --> 05:15.400
Permanently temporarily put them on hiatus. Okay. All right, and in place I've got a new a new segment here

05:22.800 --> 05:28.040
Down and Travis I do want you to know that I am going to be judging this thinking of it as the thing that is

05:28.040 --> 05:32.640
Gonna replace yahoo answer so a bit that we do three to four times per episode

05:32.640 --> 05:38.560
So absolutely bring the fuck bring the fuck ins bring that stinky heat. I think you will see Griffin this

05:39.240 --> 05:44.080
Has legs. All right, they Sam so it's called work of fart. All right

05:44.960 --> 05:50.440
This is gonna be so good. I'm already fucking excited. Yeah, the dog is back

05:50.880 --> 05:55.440
So what we've got here what what I've done here is I've taken some

05:55.440 --> 05:58.160
Classic literary works, right?

05:58.720 --> 06:05.800
But I've taken their titles and I've pund them so that they contain a word referencing

06:06.280 --> 06:07.840
feces

06:07.840 --> 06:10.680
Travis this is nice is a fucking bad idea man

06:12.720 --> 06:17.120
So I will I will give you I'll give you the description

06:18.120 --> 06:23.920
Travis I love you so much. Uh-huh. You know my love for you the size of it. Yeah. Yeah, I do

06:23.920 --> 06:28.520
Tell me how much you think I love you to the moon and back Griffin. That's from the

06:29.200 --> 06:35.240
Bullshit, that's bullshit. You fucking nut brown hair. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about how much I love you

06:35.240 --> 06:40.640
It's so much I do anything for you. And that's not a dog out of his cage, please dog

06:40.640 --> 06:48.040
Come on out. So I will give you the description of the book you try to guess the punny title. Okay, okay

06:48.040 --> 06:50.040
Wait, wait, wait, hold on

06:50.040 --> 06:56.480
You're okay. Yes. Okay. I understand the bit. Yes. Okay. Yes. This is the story of

06:57.360 --> 06:59.660
multiple towns made of feces

07:00.240 --> 07:05.420
Yes, this is a little too shitty. Oh so close tale of poo cities, but

07:06.080 --> 07:08.080
Yes, very good

07:08.800 --> 07:14.560
Very good. Like my wife's not very good. We've got it wrong. My wife listens to this show

07:14.560 --> 07:20.640
Oh when you need to murder a poop that's been making fun of you

07:27.040 --> 07:29.360
To kill a mocking turd. Yes

07:30.660 --> 07:35.100
But it sucks though, like I fucking hate that I got it. It's comedy boy

07:37.380 --> 07:40.500
Now this is gonna be a tough one this is gonna be a tough one cuz there's

07:40.500 --> 07:43.460
Like we're better than dookie humor though

07:43.460 --> 07:50.780
I did this book in summer reading and so I have to assume that it is well-known enough it just a plain old anus

07:53.220 --> 07:58.180
Just a plain old anus, this is a tough one. Wait, I think I got it

08:00.220 --> 08:03.620
Is it ordinary butthole ordinary poop hole

08:03.620 --> 08:10.740
Okay, and this was just a bonus one a Stephen King horror novel that takes

08:17.060 --> 08:19.060
Maybe uncomfortable to be in that

08:23.780 --> 08:25.420
Yeah

08:25.420 --> 08:28.940
Griffin complained the most about that bit. I got every single

08:28.940 --> 08:34.460
Like fucking Deathstroke the Terminator Charles could barely get about yeah was blown about the air. Yeah

08:34.460 --> 08:37.620
No, I feel like you're afraid of being on that wavelength

08:37.620 --> 08:40.500
But you are deeply deeply genetically connected to it

08:40.500 --> 08:46.260
Like, you know, it's there no, but it's just we it's just our comedy is there. It means a lot to people

08:49.060 --> 08:51.580
And so we when we just talk about

08:52.740 --> 08:54.300
just

08:54.300 --> 08:56.300
My wife listens to this show

08:56.300 --> 08:58.940
And my worry Griffin is that we've been too

08:59.540 --> 09:06.500
Intellectual for the whole time, right? And I think it would be nice if we had one segment that was just pure aisle

09:06.820 --> 09:11.180
Yeah, that was just that one or maybe yeah, I have slightly less

09:11.860 --> 09:13.860
I don't know

09:14.140 --> 09:18.340
Intellectual slightly less highbrow audience. We do a lot of Fraser jokes

09:18.740 --> 09:21.140
Yeah, and those are done now work of art

09:21.140 --> 09:25.900
I can't believe you said that word actually out loud because we made certain assurances to our audience

09:25.900 --> 09:29.620
I just want to say let's not let's let's put a pin in it

09:30.580 --> 09:34.900
And keep workshopping it ultimately though. We're not gonna need to replace

09:35.540 --> 09:40.020
The yahoo answers segments because it's not the website is not going to go away

09:40.820 --> 09:42.820
It's not denial

09:44.100 --> 09:47.860
And what's great is it and a lot of people won't tell you this is that if you stay on

09:48.900 --> 09:52.780
Denial and don't do like the least the less fun

09:52.780 --> 09:56.220
stages of grief. Mm-hmm, then

09:57.300 --> 10:04.900
It's okay. You can just chill on tonight. You know what? I mean like denial. Okay anger. Oh, no one wants to be angry depression

10:04.900 --> 10:07.500
I don't think so bargaining can be kind of fun

10:07.500 --> 10:13.580
But denial if you just live there for a bit then it's like it did way better than acceptance way better

10:13.580 --> 10:16.320
Well, you know, it's not a shorter road to ho

10:17.300 --> 10:21.500
Yeah, you know Griffin I heard what you just if you just stay

10:21.500 --> 10:28.620
Like with the tab open for yahoo answers. Oh, they even when they quote-unquote shut it down. You're still in there

10:28.620 --> 10:32.540
That's it. Last one out turn off the turn out the lights

10:32.660 --> 10:38.200
Well, they can't come to my computer and turn off my screen because that's not how a computer would work

10:38.420 --> 10:42.160
They can't get rid of all the floppies that you saved the entire website on to

10:42.660 --> 10:46.000
Exactly. Can I start with it? Yeah, can I read it? Yeah, well I say start

10:46.000 --> 10:51.540
This is the set now the second bit in the show third if you count the intro and then Travis's new segment

10:52.680 --> 10:55.080
Is a yahoo and I want it. Can I read it?

10:55.600 --> 11:02.080
Well, this one's sent in by the wizard Ben can't thank you. Thank you, Ben. It's yahoo answers user slip who asks

11:03.360 --> 11:07.220
Could the president get a sick face tattoo?

11:07.760 --> 11:11.000
This post isn't about politics. Oh, thank God

11:11.000 --> 11:17.180
Could the president get a sick face tattoo Congress arguably has no power to stop the president from just hopping into a tattoo parlor

11:17.180 --> 11:18.840
And getting some rad tats on their face

11:18.840 --> 11:24.100
No, if they wanted to could the president United States get their face absolutely tatted up and I will extend this to

11:25.080 --> 11:26.320
full

11:26.320 --> 11:32.380
You know cheetah sleeves like the whole nine. I actually think okay. I

11:33.080 --> 11:35.480
Griffin I think that that is actually two different

11:35.480 --> 11:41.600
Things right because imagine a president and like I'm not talking about the current president

11:41.600 --> 11:45.400
I'm saying like kind of a faceless amorphous idea of

11:45.920 --> 11:51.800
President capital a president and rolls up there's been oh no, there's been a tornado, right?

11:52.320 --> 11:59.120
Devastation everywhere president rolls up looks around rolls up their sleeves and starts picking shit up with their

11:59.120 --> 12:05.040
Like with it's fucking awesome. Like it's just fucking sleeves all the way up. Like I mean has anybody ever seen

12:05.960 --> 12:08.520
President Joe Biden with his shirt off

12:09.160 --> 12:14.040
Hey, let me ask. Hey, hey, hey. Hey guys. Hey, let me ask you a question. Okay?

12:14.840 --> 12:17.080
You ever seen a picture of Joe Biden with his shirt off

12:18.040 --> 12:21.920
Let's head to Google. Can somebody can don't Google it

12:22.880 --> 12:26.120
Can someone give me a picture of Joe Biden shirtless, please?

12:26.120 --> 12:30.600
Can I have a new detain? Can I can I have a nude Biden, please?

12:31.880 --> 12:37.300
So we've got an onion article is the top result. Oh, then it's not then it's they already did it

12:37.300 --> 12:41.000
They already did the damn joke say Justin. Hey juice as long as you're on the onion

12:41.000 --> 12:46.860
Can you check and see if they did a thing where they replaced the words of book titles with poop synonyms?

12:47.760 --> 12:49.840
Just check and see if they did that one already too

12:49.840 --> 12:56.240
I'm hitting a paywall guys. There's a paywall, you know, it's right. It's so good

12:56.240 --> 13:02.880
They they're charging for it. That's if the president already has sleeve tattoos, right? You never hear about like

13:03.640 --> 13:05.640
today the president went to

13:06.000 --> 13:11.080
The tattoo parlor and got a cool and got a cool tattoo on his face

13:11.080 --> 13:14.720
I say though that if you're the president though, and you brought that pole

13:14.720 --> 13:21.360
I think I get Banksy to like do your face tattoo. Yeah, sure. I think you could definitely probably get Banksy to do your face

13:21.360 --> 13:23.360
tattoo because I bet Banksy

13:23.400 --> 13:30.720
Would love that real estate to like say something all but fucking Banksy though. He would say you would write something like

13:32.280 --> 13:34.280
President shithead on him

13:36.360 --> 13:42.800
See it or I guess straight words cuz then he couldn't read it in the mirror cuz the mirror mirror makes things backwards

13:42.800 --> 13:45.320
Oh like war pig. Oh, that's

13:45.920 --> 13:50.440
That's great. But like we get him but like from his perspective maybe like it's on his chin

13:50.560 --> 13:55.800
So when he looks down on it, it says like great Biden on it, or maybe it's yeah

13:55.800 --> 13:59.000
Maybe it's like I feel don't know that great Biden backwards is war pig

13:59.000 --> 14:04.120
No, it's one of the it's like you you know that that font where you look at one way and it's like life and you look

14:04.120 --> 14:06.020
At the other way, it's like go death. You know what I mean?

14:06.020 --> 14:09.680
Like that kind of thing and one way it's war pig in the other way. It's great Biden

14:09.680 --> 14:15.320
Great by didn't or maybe it's just like a rhombus. Is there a rebate?

14:15.320 --> 14:17.440
What where it's just like a picture of a jet plus?

14:19.080 --> 14:21.080
Rebo

14:24.680 --> 14:30.320
It's a Prius it's a Prius and Joe Biden's look at the Prius and he's like plane hog

14:30.640 --> 14:32.640
It's like yeah. Yeah. Yeah plane hog

14:33.640 --> 14:35.360
regular hog

14:35.360 --> 14:40.960
Plane old hog man. I talk about Reince Priebus lie. He was chief of staff further our previous

14:41.680 --> 14:46.000
Stinker of a president and I didn't I guess I didn't know the gentleman's

14:46.700 --> 14:50.300
Back background, but that's one of few days. It's going a few days, but

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
He could he'd look pretty good with some

14:53.480 --> 14:54.600
tattoos

14:54.600 --> 14:56.600
Let me see if there's a shirtless Priebus

14:57.240 --> 14:59.240
Can I get shirtless?

14:59.240 --> 15:06.880
Right the biggest risk would be that if the president one day got face tattooed somebody invoking the

15:06.960 --> 15:08.160
25th right back

15:08.160 --> 15:13.280
I don't know about this, but I think that depends on what you got like what the tattoo is

15:13.640 --> 15:18.360
Yes, if it's bitchin if it's bitchin. Yeah, come back. Oh

15:18.920 --> 15:23.440
Then maybe like the the opposition's like I guess we should pass that bill

15:23.440 --> 15:30.880
Mm-hmm. Look how cool they look right that could be a power if it just comes back and it's oh and it's bitchin

15:31.160 --> 15:36.040
Yeah, they don't they don't talk about that a lot of just like oh man

15:36.040 --> 15:40.640
They passed this really unpopular bill that sucks, but Ted Cruz looked so cool today

15:40.640 --> 15:46.040
And so we had like we did his well, that's the realm of fiction Griffin. That's never going to happen

15:46.040 --> 15:51.120
I don't know man. You seen that beard. That's a dude who doesn't piss his pants anymore because he likes the feeling of the warm

15:51.120 --> 15:56.360
Water on his legs. He's moved on from that. He likes big. Yeah. Hey, he likes big boy stuff now

15:57.560 --> 16:04.560
like like he likes fucking he's he's what currently watching the wire and also

16:05.320 --> 16:12.380
And he gets why everyone liked it. He's a man now. He's a real man. He's a real big man. This man eats ribs

16:13.200 --> 16:15.200
Yeah

16:15.200 --> 16:21.480
With extra sauce something he loves more than eating a rib while I he pees in his pants

16:21.480 --> 16:24.920
No, no joke. No, I don't do that anymore Justin

16:29.760 --> 16:32.920
His favorite Disney Park is California adventure

16:33.520 --> 16:39.320
He's a real man. I heard he saw the Joker and he was like this makes a lot of sense to me

16:39.320 --> 16:42.680
And I get it. He got damaged tattooed on his head

16:42.680 --> 16:49.120
Yes, and that's why they passed his big bill. I didn't want him to do it. It's me Ted

16:49.480 --> 16:55.040
Sorry, I can't talk on the phone now. Me and my daughters are watching Reservoir Dogs. We're not scared at all

17:04.240 --> 17:09.520
I can watch all the Reservoir Dogs and I don't get scared even a little bit on a school night

17:09.520 --> 17:13.920
On a school night? It's fucking Thursday, baby. Yeah, it's 1115

17:13.920 --> 17:18.640
I got another five to ten in me. Don't let this party stop. And we door-dashed

17:19.640 --> 17:26.400
BW3s. I got the spicy wings. Yeah, not number tens, but it's like a seven out of ten on the school scale

17:26.400 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, I couldn't do like the you know, the blazons, but it's hot man. These are not milds

17:32.800 --> 17:39.280
Some days my distaste for Ted Cruz is the only thing keeps me going. Oh for sure. Yeah last night

17:39.280 --> 17:43.600
I was like blacking out trying to get my son to to please drink this bottle

17:43.600 --> 17:51.280
Please drink this bottle and then I was I started to actually pass out and then I remembered how much I fucking hate Ted Cruz

17:51.280 --> 17:56.800
And it it gave me a real a real boost of adrenaline that I couldn't quite explain

17:57.080 --> 18:02.120
It's funny because sometimes I feel like my hatred of Ted Cruz and my hatred of Mike Huckabee

18:02.280 --> 18:06.780
They like to fight like imagine if a giant gorilla

18:06.780 --> 18:13.220
Yeah, I'm like a giant lizard. We're fighting for supremacy. Yeah, except the end result was which one of these two

18:14.140 --> 18:21.180
Absolute dipshits do I hate more right now? That's kind of where I'm at. You know, I really hope this doesn't come off as performative gang

18:21.180 --> 18:26.220
I really fucking hate Ted Cruz a lot. He sucks major shit big time. Yeah, big time. Yeah

18:27.500 --> 18:29.500
Hey, how about it's me? Yes

18:30.260 --> 18:35.980
Question. Yeah, I wanted I was about to deliver one. Okay for the first time in my life. I have an awesome office job

18:35.980 --> 18:41.660
It's how long I've been podcasting came as the office anymore. I've got an office job

18:41.700 --> 18:44.580
My boss strives for close-knit and fun vibe

18:44.580 --> 18:49.200
Oh, I however don't aim to be very social at work the other day

18:49.200 --> 18:53.720
I made a joke in front of my boss and he said I should channel that energy more awesome

18:56.460 --> 19:02.180
How can I come across this fun-loving and social when I am NOT and that's from grouching Grand Rapids

19:02.180 --> 19:08.700
Hey, do you hear this one? Do you hear what Tom said? He said where do where do cows go to look at art the

19:09.260 --> 19:14.020
Museum channel that energy more time. Hey, hey. Hey, I know your whole thing

19:14.620 --> 19:16.180
Quiet guy, right?

19:16.180 --> 19:20.900
No, don't do that. I want one joke a day on my desk

19:20.900 --> 19:27.380
I want you to come on my office once a day and tell me a joke right down the barrel baby, or you're fucking fired

19:27.380 --> 19:29.380
I

19:30.620 --> 19:34.560
You're gonna have fun at work are you gonna have fun at home? Yes, these are two choices

19:35.180 --> 19:41.140
We've already got a Toby. We've already got an Oscar. We need a gym here. You're that Jim

19:41.740 --> 19:44.540
I just walked by your desk. I looked in the trashcan

19:45.180 --> 19:51.300
And I saw all the couch balls. I gave you yesterday to have fun with in the office. I'm fucking fuming man

19:51.300 --> 19:55.340
I know you don't see here. Are you sitting huh? Are you sitting on a regular chair?

19:55.340 --> 19:58.640
I thought we said exercise balls. Do we not say exercise balls?

19:59.540 --> 20:03.620
Hey, you haven't even open the nerf hoop. Hey

20:04.180 --> 20:06.180
That's nerf. Hope I got it for you

20:06.780 --> 20:13.460
$7 the money doesn't go on trees and then your neuro folks, but they might go on your door. Just put a nerf hoop up

20:14.380 --> 20:20.540
It kind of seems like you're always working hard and you're almost never hardly working. Yeah

20:20.540 --> 20:26.340
Um, it's important that we do both. I know you're meeting all your quotas just barely but do you have time for softball?

20:26.740 --> 20:28.900
This is not asked for ten minutes a day

20:29.740 --> 20:36.140
For joke construction and oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's saying this is fine. I will bring this energy

20:36.140 --> 20:43.580
I'm gonna need ten minutes paid on the clock to come up with a fucking banger and then a five-minute cooldown after

20:44.140 --> 20:45.680
right and

20:45.680 --> 20:52.460
It's just they walk by your desk and it's like what do you listen to there? And it's it's funny stand-up comedy from

20:52.980 --> 20:55.820
Everybody's favorite comedians like Andrew Dice Clay

20:57.700 --> 21:03.460
Just listen to some greatest hits it's it's oh man Andrew Dice Clay again, huh? Yeah, I guess so

21:03.460 --> 21:06.620
Yeah, damn. I had to Google the best the

21:06.620 --> 21:15.020
Famous comedians to do that. I found a list and fucking Michael Richards is number 12 on the list. Are you sure guys? I'm back

21:16.020 --> 21:18.580
Well, oh wait. Yeah. Wait, what was this search term?

21:19.580 --> 21:24.820
Wife will beg it. This is the most controversial comedians of all time and all of a sudden. This makes a lot more sense

21:26.460 --> 21:27.900
Yeah, it's up there

21:27.900 --> 21:34.020
Yeah, the fact that Andrew Dice Clay and Michael Richards is on the list Griffin made me wonder what your search terms were

21:34.020 --> 21:37.000
I searched cool guys

21:39.820 --> 21:47.420
Cool guys to hang out with Griffin's personal heroes folks with a real hearty funny bone

21:50.780 --> 21:52.780
Comedy like it used to be

21:53.020 --> 21:56.380
Classic like your grandpa laughed at right, right

21:56.980 --> 21:58.980
This sucks so bad

21:58.980 --> 22:04.820
Yeah, but maybe there's something in you know, you did crack one joke and it does make you wonder maybe there's a

22:05.460 --> 22:09.860
Joker deep down inside of you, you know kind of a funny boy. Oh, yeah

22:09.860 --> 22:15.940
Okay, and you got a awakened nerd. Why don't you just try to nurture your funny boy? I'm just saying do it on company time

22:15.940 --> 22:23.240
Yeah, for sure to channel that energy. Oh, this is good because like at best you find a funny within right?

22:23.240 --> 22:25.900
And now you're another funster, right?

22:25.900 --> 22:31.740
But at worst you're not good at it and maybe your boss will be like, hey don't channel that energy anymore

22:32.420 --> 22:39.220
Hey, I see you working really hard to channel that energy. You need you to stop channeling that energy. Yeah, you're too funny

22:39.740 --> 22:43.940
Well get anything done. I am kind of fixated on this sentence. I

22:44.500 --> 22:51.500
However, don't aim to be very social at work. That's a very interesting about a boundary you've set for yourself

22:51.500 --> 22:57.220
Yeah, like you got to work and you're like I get this I get it. I'm just not gonna I

22:57.860 --> 23:00.700
Don't know. I'm not I'm really not gonna connect with anybody

23:01.580 --> 23:07.380
Versus a level. This is the decision I've made. I will say I kind of get so I am a very social person, right?

23:07.380 --> 23:12.500
but when I had office jobs, I would oftentimes be like the first person there and

23:13.260 --> 23:19.420
There was a certain magic right up until the first time I had to interact with somebody, right?

23:19.420 --> 23:24.820
Cuz even though I was there that time was mine. Oh, you know now it's my like hangout

23:24.820 --> 23:29.700
I'm there doing the thing and as soon as someone else came in it's like, oh, hey Travis was like, oh

23:30.220 --> 23:34.540
Now it's worth just working. I get that so I think if I got an office job now

23:34.540 --> 23:38.780
I would see if I could go the whole day without that

23:38.780 --> 23:43.340
I think that that would be a very fun game to see how long I could go without

23:44.100 --> 23:45.140
encountering

23:45.140 --> 23:50.700
Another person they don't have that option. It doesn't yeah. Well, that's a side. That's open to them. You know, it's

23:51.220 --> 23:54.420
Well, well, hold on. It sounds like Travis has like a scheme

23:54.780 --> 24:00.660
I'm just saying that like maybe that's the thing the energy you could start to channel is

24:01.180 --> 24:07.500
A lot more maybe like doing your work from hidden places from the vents

24:08.220 --> 24:11.820
The work is getting done, but they never see who does it. That's cool

24:11.820 --> 24:16.220
That's that and then they're chatting in the break room like hey, did you see WandaVision last night?

24:16.220 --> 24:19.180
And they're like that show went off the air like a month ago Griffin

24:19.180 --> 24:23.520
You should learn some new television shows and then you reach over to take a bite of your sandwich, but it's gone

24:23.860 --> 24:29.500
Yep, and then you look over at the nearby vent and it's sliding closed and you know, that's Terry

24:30.180 --> 24:35.900
Yep, he doesn't write Terry the vent person this office bad boy and local person that lives

24:36.540 --> 24:38.540
and wall person

24:38.540 --> 24:40.540
Um

24:40.940 --> 24:46.460
How about another do you have more yahoo? I feel like it's now a non-renewable resource

24:46.460 --> 24:51.660
Yeah, sure. Let me burn some of my some of my fuel here. How about I ask another question?

24:51.660 --> 24:55.620
We'll save now cuz this one's this one's really fucking good. No, I read it

24:55.620 --> 25:00.820
It's also from Ben Ben can't the wizard really cast a spell on me this week with these great yahoos

25:01.140 --> 25:02.220
There's just a thing

25:02.220 --> 25:06.780
There's an alert at the top of the page now that says that they're gonna shut down on May 4th

25:06.780 --> 25:08.460
They it's shutting down on May 4th

25:08.460 --> 25:12.740
But starting on April 20th the sacred holiday for weed funny stuff

25:12.740 --> 25:15.700
It is when they are not gonna allow you to write any more questions

25:15.700 --> 25:22.180
So really that's pretty much when it dies doesn't that make you think that that's their highest traffic day then they're like, yeah

25:22.180 --> 25:26.340
We don't want to go through another 420. Do you guys think it's kind of weird that like I

25:26.900 --> 25:28.900
Don't want to I don't want to distract but

25:29.640 --> 25:36.180
May 4th will now be the day that Yahoo answer shut down and the day that we did the worst live show

25:36.180 --> 25:38.940
We've ever done or that anyone's ever done in their entire life

25:38.940 --> 25:43.940
And I feel like maybe we need to be a little bit. I'm starting to get like I love Star Wars

25:43.940 --> 25:47.060
Yeah, don't get me wrong. I'm starting to get a little skittish about that date

25:47.060 --> 25:50.260
Cuz this is the second really bad thing that's happened on a May 4th. Yeah

25:50.780 --> 25:56.700
Okay, I it's hard for me to hold that against Star Wars Justin cuz you know Phantom Menace just means so much to me

25:56.700 --> 25:59.500
Travis loves that flick. We agree that them

26:00.020 --> 26:05.380
Stopping new questions on 420 and then shutting it down on Star Wars days fucking it's pretty fun

26:05.380 --> 26:07.380
Really targeted yeah, it's good

26:07.380 --> 26:08.340
But I do like that

26:08.340 --> 26:14.740
I do like that they thought we'll leave two weeks where people to finish answering the questions that are already there. Oh, dude

26:14.740 --> 26:20.340
It's read only you're not even answering shit. It's just like we're gonna give you two weeks to fucking

26:20.720 --> 26:23.500
Brush up on all the great stuff. I

26:24.140 --> 26:30.500
Hope the thing that you wanted to know is something that somebody else has also wanted to know and asked on Yahoo answers and that

26:30.500 --> 26:32.500
helpful people

26:32.500 --> 26:39.500
Beating the odds came to their assistance. You have two weeks. Good luck. The fucking hunt is on. Good luck rat race

26:42.140 --> 26:46.780
Sure, yeah, thank you Ben can't it's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm gonna call

26:47.420 --> 26:49.140
Jeffy asks

26:49.140 --> 26:55.220
Do all cowboys kill or do some have a no kill rule like superheroes?

26:55.220 --> 26:57.220
Hmm

27:00.420 --> 27:02.420
Okay, yeah

27:02.860 --> 27:07.780
There's a lot of bad. There's a lot of bad cowboys out there who like quicken the dead

27:07.780 --> 27:13.220
They're like shooting each other and they're not getting back up. They're yeah, they are they are dead

27:13.780 --> 27:19.380
And they're shooting each other in that movie without any kind of hesitation. Yeah as fast as they can

27:19.980 --> 27:21.980
It's kind of the thing

27:21.980 --> 27:27.520
Significance seven. I think one of them like shoots a dynamite and blows up a bunch of guys. So yeah

27:28.020 --> 27:34.460
Those guys are dead. You can't tell me they're not dead. That's TNC. Is this is this a a

27:35.540 --> 27:41.500
Like zero or all thing of like what if a cowboy just kills once is that?

27:42.020 --> 27:49.700
Then are they a killer or are they just like a murdering one person makes you a murderer. Okay? Okay, okay

27:49.700 --> 27:52.220
I'm just saying that like on the scale, right? Yeah

27:52.220 --> 27:56.900
They're probably some cowboy like maybe that there is a margin for cowboy murder

27:56.900 --> 28:02.740
No, it's just an acceptable level like well that cowboy only killed five people when they be cool

28:02.740 --> 28:06.020
if like more cowboy movies ended with like

28:06.380 --> 28:13.900
The the police showing up and they're like, what have you all done? Yeah, there are still laws. You can't do this

28:13.900 --> 28:16.220
well, I think most I think the

28:16.220 --> 28:23.620
All West police are in are embroiled in this in the all you needed back then was a star a metal star

28:23.620 --> 28:27.780
That's true. Whatever you want. Yeah, what if the real cops showed up and like we're excuse me

28:27.780 --> 28:33.020
We're the real police and this is a person with a metal star on their chests and they're going to real jail. I

28:33.940 --> 28:40.420
Think that there should be more cowboy movies in which the cow yes period but also that the cowboys do kill

28:40.420 --> 28:47.580
But with kindness and you don't see that I think cowboy movies where the bad guys like I'm taking over this whole town

28:48.180 --> 28:51.520
Railroads coming through here. This is mine and the Cowboys are like

28:52.140 --> 28:59.140
Okay, we'll help you move and clean up and maybe we'll show you thing about what it means to really love

28:59.140 --> 29:01.580
Oh, I thought you were talking about like cowboy hospice

29:03.620 --> 29:05.620
Which I don't know what that looks like

29:05.620 --> 29:11.020
I know I'm ready to I am I am ready to transition to the next plane and oh

29:11.700 --> 29:18.020
I want a tinder transition and I want to be surrounded by loved ones and one cowboy

29:20.740 --> 29:27.060
Partner I went and these are these are all the special medicines we're gonna use and it's gonna be a gentle tinder time

29:28.220 --> 29:33.340
You're gonna be pushing up daisies, but it'll be pleasant passing. Don't worry. Don't worry

29:33.340 --> 29:36.540
Worry, we'll lay you to rest in Boothill with all your love

29:38.440 --> 29:42.220
You see the undertaker measuring them and the president's like, oh thank god

29:43.340 --> 29:50.700
It seems kind of perplexing that more cowboy movies don't have a scene where they come like the cowboy and they're like listen

29:50.700 --> 29:57.860
The there's a lot of bad dudes and they're taking over the town and they're running it and the cowboy never says like actually

29:57.860 --> 29:59.860
Have a lot of cow related business

29:59.860 --> 30:04.380
Like you're looking for like, I'm probably a murderer

30:05.900 --> 30:08.300
Murderer I actually have like cow shit

30:09.500 --> 30:12.900
Literally, I know I've helped you out before with like some gun-related

30:13.500 --> 30:17.780
Activities and that was so cool. But if you look at all these fucking cows, they're not gonna boy themselves

30:17.780 --> 30:25.980
I was saying I've got cow things was was there just one really cool rancher in history who inspired this whole

30:25.980 --> 30:28.500
Mythos that was just like oh man bad dudes are coming to town

30:28.500 --> 30:34.820
Well, you need to get up to fucking Jefferson's steers and stuff and go ask for Jefferson

30:34.820 --> 30:38.860
Cuz that dude is off his fucking nut and he will absolutely kill

30:40.300 --> 30:42.440
Things cow and murdering

30:43.140 --> 30:49.180
He has he makes the good milk and he fucking kills lots and lots and lots of people

30:49.180 --> 30:56.140
He is fucking wild that dude go get Jefferson. There's a reason that he works in a slaughter related industry

30:56.140 --> 30:59.140
Right, it would be like if in 200 years

30:59.420 --> 31:04.940
There's a movie we're like and there was only one man if people could turn to the forklift

31:06.500 --> 31:10.420
Much like all forklift operators. He was a fucking crazy murderer

31:11.540 --> 31:14.140
They would call him like fork boys

31:14.140 --> 31:29.700
Yeah, he's carrying a bunch of barrels. What's he gonna do with those barrels?

31:30.740 --> 31:37.660
Damn you lifting fork boys. He palleted us again. Damn damn put dropped a pallet on my son

31:37.660 --> 31:42.780
To be fair my son was killing other folk to you

31:44.180 --> 31:50.300
Motorcycles kind of a steel horse. Oh my god, just you're right. That's awesome. Fuck dude. That's cool

31:51.100 --> 31:53.100
You say the coolest shit sometimes

31:55.900 --> 31:57.900
Okay, say something cool about

31:59.180 --> 32:01.980
Like Frankie said I did it my way. Yeah

32:01.980 --> 32:10.460
Fuck yeah, cool thing to say too. That's cool. And like a old Vegas like it's like an old Vegas Martini guy way

32:14.060 --> 32:16.280
Do you know any Michael Buble lyrics sir

32:17.260 --> 32:20.740
What Michael Buble? He's cool, right? I know some of the melodies

32:20.740 --> 32:26.780
The you know

Squad

37:29.060 --> 37:31.060
I want to munch

37:31.060 --> 37:33.060
Squad

37:33.060 --> 37:35.060
Welcome to Munch Squad

37:35.060 --> 37:42.060
Welcome to Munch Squad with the podcast of the podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating. I don't know why I mispronounced that word

37:42.060 --> 37:45.160
I've only said podcasting seven or eight times in my life, right?

37:46.380 --> 37:51.180
I've only ever read it. I've never seen it. I want to share two great things with you guys today

37:51.820 --> 37:56.580
The first is very brief, but I did want to mention this is a headline on QSR

37:56.580 --> 38:00.460
Which is my number one source for brand eating related news. Here's the headline

38:01.020 --> 38:04.060
It's gonna take more than a pandemic to stop A&W

38:04.060 --> 38:06.780
Come at them. They got good hot dogs fucking try it

38:07.300 --> 38:11.940
Hey A&W. Can we actually pause for a second and talk about hubris? Yeah

38:12.260 --> 38:16.980
I'm not sure that you want to invite like what is that the best you got universe?

38:17.820 --> 38:20.640
We're gonna talk a little bit. We're gonna check in on Kevin Basner

38:20.640 --> 38:24.540
Who's one of my favorite CEOs in the game spit and fire every day?

38:24.540 --> 38:28.620
Just here's here's a quote to give you a little bit of Kevin Basner flavor

38:29.820 --> 38:32.700
Sales started going up about ten weeks into the pandemic

38:32.700 --> 38:34.060
and

38:34.060 --> 38:38.540
He said I think we every week we were pinching ourselves. Is this a bump?

38:38.540 --> 38:42.620
Is this a head fake? Are we going to go back into the dumpster tomorrow?

38:44.940 --> 38:46.940
Oh boy

38:47.860 --> 38:49.860
Listen I'm a straight shooter folks

38:52.420 --> 38:53.860
It's just a great

38:53.860 --> 38:59.580
Because the implications there that there was a week a few weeks before that when CEO Kevin Basner is like

38:59.580 --> 39:05.900
Hey guys, we're in the fucking dumpster right now. We need to get out the fuck together. Our only hope is that a pandemic hits

39:07.380 --> 39:14.300
Hey Todd, you've been working on that pandemic virus that we're gonna spread around right? All right to boost our root beer sales

39:15.860 --> 39:19.840
Because we okay they went back to one of the things they point out is that they

39:20.340 --> 39:23.660
Stop making like when the yum brands own them

39:23.660 --> 39:29.080
they were they're getting the root beer in a bag and it was coming in the bag and they put the fountain machine and

39:30.960 --> 39:35.560
Now they're a hundred percent of stores are just making the root beer there

39:35.960 --> 39:43.300
They're making it in the store and w sells root beer three to one against other soft. Fuck. Yes farm-to-market sarsaparilla

39:44.080 --> 39:46.080
Yeah, absolutely, man

39:46.360 --> 39:48.040
and then

39:48.040 --> 39:52.600
Just a lot of that though can be credited to when you go to an A&W and they ask you what you want to drink

39:52.600 --> 39:56.440
If you say like coke they go really really do you really?

39:57.520 --> 39:59.200
really

39:59.200 --> 40:04.560
Really until you finally what they do is they say if you like coke, this is gonna drive you wild

40:10.760 --> 40:12.540
This is just a quote from the article

40:12.540 --> 40:15.840
This is not Kevin Basner one thing that doesn't get talked about enough

40:15.840 --> 40:22.320
Especially in lockdown stretches is how drive-thru Blair's a we're open signal to guests

40:22.320 --> 40:28.280
It's the herd counter to quarantine life. Whoa, is it safe to eat at a restaurant?

40:28.520 --> 40:34.160
Well, ten cars were lined up outside A&W. That's a fucking wire

40:34.160 --> 40:39.800
That's humanity in a nutshell, right? I guess it is one of the thing that I think they literally

40:40.160 --> 40:46.000
Referred to human beings as a herd. They're lining up to the trough to eat right? Yeah, it's a fast-food website

40:46.000 --> 40:51.840
What do you want certain restaurants added a second menu board to handle elevated traffic?

40:51.840 --> 40:56.000
That's one way of an interesting way of helping deal with kovat. Here's another a

40:57.200 --> 41:01.160
Kansas location even created quote bubbles

41:01.640 --> 41:06.260
For employees to wear and guard themselves from the virus and the elements

41:06.400 --> 41:11.300
They had a tablet underneath the plastic and could talk to guests and the article

41:11.560 --> 41:18.200
Continues from there and does not stop and like hold on. I know you're wondering what the fuck we're even talking about

41:18.200 --> 41:24.540
So let us pause for a second explain the A&W bubbles that we trapped employees in for the kovat time

41:24.540 --> 41:26.700
I have never more in my life

41:26.700 --> 41:32.900
Where should they had interviewed the person that they were talking about then I do right that I need this one

41:33.380 --> 41:38.980
Wildcat because they didn't say what they don't say. It's not like the one cat that invented the like

41:39.660 --> 41:40.940
You know

41:40.940 --> 41:46.260
Filet-o-fish and then McDonald's is like good idea. We'll go we'll do that the other ones

41:46.260 --> 41:52.060
This is just one wildcat that did this an A&W was like, huh? Good effort. Hey cool

41:52.700 --> 41:56.980
Hey, maybe you shouldn't talk to everybody about this like super good effort

41:56.980 --> 42:01.260
We really wish maybe that maybe that employee do that found she was gonna roll in that day

42:01.260 --> 42:04.340
And he really wanted to knock his socks off really make a good impression

42:06.420 --> 42:10.900
Here's the real story White Castle launches birthday cake on a stick, huh?

42:10.900 --> 42:18.900
And then the last word that headline is dessert, which yeah, okay, I gathered not a savory app

42:18.900 --> 42:20.380
Oh now

42:20.380 --> 42:25.780
White Castle a family-owned business since 1921. Happy 100th birthday White Castle

42:25.780 --> 42:32.420
They formally kicked off the 100th birthday on March 10th with special events and offers to continue throughout the year

42:33.340 --> 42:38.140
This month the fast-food innovator unveils a few crave worthy items

42:38.140 --> 42:44.220
Oh, yeah, Justin do you you spend a lot of time in the QSR you spend a lot of time in that realm, right?

42:44.220 --> 42:45.900
Not a not a compliment

42:45.900 --> 42:52.100
No, do you think that quick service restaurants have used the word crave so much that it's lost all meaning

42:52.580 --> 42:56.220
Yeah, 100% crave is meaningless now. Okay in

42:57.020 --> 43:02.140
1927 Billy Ingram the founder of White Castle and great-grandfather of the current generation at the helm

43:02.140 --> 43:09.180
Invented restaurant carryout by offering a bag of sliders that could be purchased specifically to take home and

43:09.820 --> 43:16.180
Before that nothing and what were bags for? No one knew. Hey, can I can I have this food?

43:16.180 --> 43:18.180
But I want to eat it at home. No

43:18.620 --> 43:23.660
Can I have three hamburgers you're being fucking ridiculous. Are you gonna carry one on your head?

43:24.940 --> 43:29.260
Alongside that innovation came one of the industry's most recognized taglines

43:29.260 --> 43:33.180
Buy them by the sack. Oh, yeah that replaced their old

43:33.900 --> 43:36.840
Tagline bring a hand-darned sack from home

43:38.140 --> 43:42.420
Fill it with our burger, but I pop up come get a sack

43:43.820 --> 43:49.300
Today the traditions continue to White Castle restaurants where a 10 sack of sliders is available at any time

43:49.940 --> 43:55.560
Morning noon or night because I guess denying people the right to do that at a White Castle would actually be insane

43:55.780 --> 43:57.780
Why would you even be open?

43:57.780 --> 44:03.460
um, there's a special tin sack offer that covers cravers for the meal, but often

44:11.420 --> 44:14.380
There's a special tin sack offers cover craver

44:14.380 --> 44:29.060
For the meal. I'm gonna try to make it. Yeah, say it again. Are you missing? Stop like this is not one of my like little goof-a-boats.

44:29.060 --> 44:36.540
The special tin sack offers cover cravers for the meal. Are you missing any words? Are you dropping words Justin?

44:38.540 --> 44:43.260
I'm gonna slack it to you guys so you can see I'm saying it fucking verbatim.

44:43.260 --> 44:48.780
The special tin sack offers cover cravers for the meal, but often dessert is essential particularly when celebrating something special.

44:48.780 --> 44:54.940
Travis, I would have said this to you, but just put it in slack read this read the sentence. Oh God

44:55.220 --> 44:59.340
Just read it. The special tin sack offers cover cravers for the meal

44:59.340 --> 45:03.820
But often dessert is essential particularly when celebrating something special

45:04.220 --> 45:09.660
Wow, so we've offered cover cravers for the meal. That's that's standard

45:09.660 --> 45:12.620
Mark your calendar for April 18th

45:13.140 --> 45:19.140
Just write it up there. Nothing weird about it because White Castle is gonna begin offering its new sweet edition

45:20.100 --> 45:24.700
Birthday cake on a stick now that seems like a wild promotion, but it's actually just joining

45:25.380 --> 45:29.840
The lineup of dessert favorites, which includes fudge dip cheesecake on a stick

45:30.260 --> 45:33.340
Fudge dip brownie on a stick and gooey butter cake on a stick

45:33.340 --> 45:39.340
The birthday cake variation features a vanilla cake base with white frost

45:39.860 --> 45:47.780
Topped with blue white and orange sprinkles this limited time dessert offering is perfect for celebrating 100 years of cravings

45:47.780 --> 45:49.220
now listen

45:49.220 --> 45:56.820
When it's late in the night, and I've lost all sense of self-control when it comes to eating because you know

45:56.820 --> 45:58.380
Life is hard sometimes

45:58.380 --> 46:03.100
That sounds great. I would totally destroy three of those. Yeah, it sounds pretty good

46:03.100 --> 46:06.900
Jamie Richardson's the veep over at White Castle and he says

46:07.940 --> 46:13.100
Throughout this year throughout the year. We're inviting cravers to be part of the festivities

46:13.100 --> 46:13.940
Oh, thank God

46:13.940 --> 46:20.340
So pass around the birthday cake on a stick and let's celebrate the next 100 years and now that I mentioned it

46:20.340 --> 46:24.180
Probably don't pass around. Don't do that. Hey, there is a global don't do that

46:24.180 --> 46:30.140
Unless you've had all did you have all three vaccines then you can pass around birthday cake on a stick go nuts

46:30.140 --> 46:34.460
I like what that implies because that implies that it's like a birthday party and there's cake for everybody

46:34.460 --> 46:37.860
But that's like if I had a birthday party and everybody came to my party and I said, okay cool

46:37.860 --> 46:39.860
Do you want some cake? It's $3.99 a piece

46:41.660 --> 46:43.180
It does look kind of good though

46:43.180 --> 46:48.820
It kind of looks like one of those little Debbie's like a little Debbie, but somebody but someone fucking stabbed it

46:49.100 --> 46:51.900
It looks like a little Debbie that someone desecrated

46:52.060 --> 46:55.580
Do you think hey folks when you break when you're done with your birth cake?

46:55.580 --> 47:00.580
You got cake on a stick and they mentioned this specifically and it says here Kevin Richardson then added

47:00.740 --> 47:03.320
Please don't bring the stick back to White Castle

47:03.320 --> 47:09.980
we've had so many people and their hearts are in the right place asking if we wanted the sticks back for other birthday cakes and

47:10.060 --> 47:15.100
We had to tell him no the stick is there's the key which they have a hard time believing because it's a pretty good stick

47:15.100 --> 47:17.100
I'll think it does not say that

47:17.300 --> 47:19.300
Yeah, it's all in there

47:19.300 --> 47:25.580
Man, do you think if you're in the White Castle and you like take a fork and just kind of push the cake off the stick?

47:25.580 --> 47:31.340
Onto a plate that one of the employees comes in is like we don't do table cake and they just take it away from

47:32.140 --> 47:34.140
No table cake at the White Castle

47:34.580 --> 47:36.260
Don't dirty a dish

47:36.260 --> 47:38.260
Keep a stick

47:38.900 --> 47:41.260
Don't dirty this make some trash I

47:43.140 --> 47:45.140
Think we've only done one regular question

47:45.140 --> 47:52.140
When I was 10 my fifth grade teacher gave us all keys as part of a class project and tasked us to find what the keys

47:52.140 --> 47:54.060
Open, I was extremely stubborn

47:54.060 --> 47:57.300
So I spent hours making my friends try the locks around my school

47:57.300 --> 48:00.580
And when we finally gave up my teacher told us if we came back in 10 years

48:01.340 --> 48:04.420
She would give us the answer. I vowed I would return

48:05.060 --> 48:08.820
However, she was a terribly mean teacher and I did not want any contact with him

48:08.980 --> 48:14.180
How do I find the answer to this mystery that has been in the back of my mind for 13 years while also holding a petty

48:14.180 --> 48:18.700
Grudge, that's from ollie. I love to get your eyes. Yeah, I got the I have that

48:19.260 --> 48:24.300
answer yeah, perfect because it was gonna be something like you show up and you're but you're old and

48:24.980 --> 48:31.740
She's much older now and you're like, oh mrs. Hawthorne and she's so fucking I mean, it's a real

48:32.860 --> 48:40.980
Trunchbull situation and you're like remember this you hold the key and she's like, yeah, you know, so what's that open and she's like

48:40.980 --> 48:44.060
It'll be some bullshit like the doors of

48:44.980 --> 48:53.420
Opportunity and the key is reading and behind the door is the is your future and you want to be an astronaut

48:54.020 --> 48:58.300
Use this use your reading key to the opportunities future

48:58.820 --> 49:00.820
now Griffin, I think that that is

49:02.940 --> 49:09.340
Optimistic, okay that there was a lesson behind it because I am looking this right fifth grade

49:09.340 --> 49:13.620
Gave a bunch of keys. Yeah said the class project is

49:14.820 --> 49:16.820
Find what in the world?

49:17.380 --> 49:22.160
This random key goes. Yeah, I don't think your teacher fucking knew

49:22.180 --> 49:28.980
Yeah, no, here is the here is the story teachers hungover shows up at school. They're like teachers aid

49:30.020 --> 49:31.340
mr

49:31.340 --> 49:39.460
Peterson Lee says so what's the lesson plans today? And he's just like, oh, no

49:42.500 --> 49:44.940
Okay, hold on let me look and see what I got in my wallet

49:46.780 --> 49:50.620
Okay, okay, yeah, I'll come up with something out of this this the whole thing is made up

49:50.700 --> 49:56.960
This is someone who is just stalling for time. Yeah, and who wanted to go back to because why why would they say ten years?

49:56.960 --> 50:02.600
Years end of the year end of the year. So at the end of the year, I'll tell you right you haven't you get the

50:02.600 --> 50:09.040
Day, you graduate. Yeah, even that would be another possibility. But ten years is yeah come back in ten years

50:09.040 --> 50:14.160
Oh, yeah, they picked that they picked the amount of years that you definitely would not follow, right?

50:14.160 --> 50:19.160
Exactly. That's actually my answer is now I think been proven categorically wrong

50:19.720 --> 50:25.360
Because you can't actually would be 13 years for this person come back and say so what's the key do and they're like

50:25.360 --> 50:33.280
It's the key to opportunity. I mean then you're like, I'm fucking like 36 and it hasn't really happened for me yet

50:33.520 --> 50:39.440
So it's not a really that it's not really that I mean readings great and all but it hasn't necessarily

50:39.720 --> 50:41.720
helped me be an astronaut and

50:42.400 --> 50:48.340
No one in the class where they all the same keys where they random what the fuck happened

50:48.340 --> 50:50.340
I think it's just a drunk drunk drunk

50:50.340 --> 50:58.140
Drunk drawer keys. I want one sweaty kid to come running in like mine opened the break room at the Kroger on fifth Street

50:58.140 --> 51:00.140
What the fuck?

51:00.540 --> 51:02.540
Did you have this

51:02.900 --> 51:07.400
Mine unlocked a safety deposit bucks and inside there was some bloody

51:08.020 --> 51:12.760
Yeah, this this one actually I got inside of mr. Jefferson's

51:13.500 --> 51:15.500
Camaro and I drove it

51:15.500 --> 51:22.500
And I'm fucking 10 so like this is on you I think you tell me it's on me. I drove mr

51:22.500 --> 51:29.220
Jefferson's Camaro and I hit a building on it and I'm 10. So what's the lesson here reading?

51:29.220 --> 51:37.300
Oh, sure. I get it now the Camaros like opportunities and the building I hit which was a hospital is future

51:39.460 --> 51:44.720
Does this mean does this mean yes, you're gonna be a doctor. Holy shit. That's a good lesson

51:44.720 --> 51:48.620
Yeah, for sure, even with a criminal record. Well, well shit. Yeah

51:52.260 --> 51:56.900
