00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:34.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around.

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, when a pretty bird shows up.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If I need you back, I'm gonna be best, and it ain't no problem.

00:53.000 --> 01:18.000
If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you got no place to go, when a pretty bird shows up.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
I think if you have to say at the beginning, like, sorry that we're not gonna use a bunch of dirty words, that's enough of a heads up, I think.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Now we fucking will.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
So we're going with a post-holiday theme for this episode and not an end of 2010 theme? Or can we do both?

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
I mean, I guess, yeah. It always seems like such a weird gray area. It feels like the two should be back to back.

01:50.000 --> 02:00.000
What's gonna happen in this week? Nothing. Fun. Except, one thing that I can think of, my brother and my brother and me, it's an advice show for the modern era.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
We're gonna close 2010 out big.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Killing Zolo.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
Killing Zolo. We miss him. Let's do the rest of him upright.

02:10.000 --> 02:22.000
Hey brother, it's Mack Roy. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on a mature way to deal with my ex. He broke up with me, but since we broke up, he's been a huge douche. Doing things like saying he'll drop off some of my stuff, but leaving rotting food instead.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
That's a pretty good one, though.

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
He got you. Pretty good. Is there a way I can let him know it isn't acceptable, but get back at him at the same time without being immature? Or would it be better just to ignore it all? Thanks, MBMBAM.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
That's from Iona Grace from Gmail.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
I think, I think Iona, you just have to take the moral victory.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
You gotta take the high ground and not rise to the bait, because that's gonna irritate him more than anything. Trust me.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
If you just pretend like he is nothing to you, and whatever he's doing is not getting to you, and it really can't, you just gotta shut it out. You're done with him.

02:59.000 --> 03:12.000
I think the shittiest part about the whole situation is he broke up with you, and he's being a douche. Like, that's just not cool. So, this is going to be a story you get to tell in 10 years, and I think you need to look at it that way.

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
Because you didn't do anything wrong, so there's nothing to feel bad about, there's nothing to... So just you get to be the better person. Congratulations.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Unless...

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Unless...

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Why don't you escalate this shit?

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
Why don't you escalate it to a level he is no longer comfortable responding to?

03:31.000 --> 03:42.000
So, you ask... He says he'll drop off some stuff, but instead leaves rotting fruit. What if you say you're gonna drop off some rotting fruit, but instead you burn his house down?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
You burn his house... I was about to say burn his house down, yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Leave some slices of bologna on his car, and then it'll take the paint off.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Oh, this is good. It's like a callback episode.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Maybe kill an elderly relative. I mean, so it's not like a big deal, because they're old anyways.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah, like an extended one.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah, so no one's going to make a big deal out of it to begin with, because they were old.

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
You're saying if you... What's the bar that you can clear there where killing an old person isn't a crime? Is it like 85?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
85 is not a crime.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
No, with modern science these days, I would put it at least 96. People are living to like 120, 122 now.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
No way.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
You're practically doing my favor at that point.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
That's what I'm saying.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
My rule is 95, you shouldn't be alive. So after that, you're just setting the world back to balance.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I'm sorry if anybody's bubby is that old, by the way.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
Another good one is get his email address, and I know you got it. Get his email address and sign him up for every...

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Every spam.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
Haggard mailing list you can find, because that's brutal. Somebody did that to me. Thanks, whoever that was.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
And he's been annoying forever.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
You can do that in conjunction with burning his house down too, which is the best part about it. It's a cheap and easy way.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
You really shouldn't do any of these things. Just write it out. You won.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
You got two options though. We'll give you some flexibility, something to play with.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Ride or die.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Ride or die.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
I'll give you this one. Letting him know it isn't acceptable, but at the same time get back at him. Tell his mom what he did.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Let his mom know he left some rotting food on your front porch.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That's kind of fun. I like it.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, and it's kind of like third grade-y.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah, it is.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
That's my favorite part about it.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
Hey, Moobinbam. I want to know the best way to deal with the awkwardness of apologizing for something you aren't really sorry about.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Ooh, Ryan from Gmail.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Is that awkward?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Is that awkward?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I do that at least 20 times a day, and it doesn't bother me too much.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Practice may be the answer.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I always started off with, I'm sorry you got upset.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
No, that's the worst.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
No, no, no.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
That just makes me angrier than the thing they did originally.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, that's the thing. If you're not sorry for it, then it doesn't bother me because I'm not sorry for it.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I didn't do anything wrong.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
Maybe you need to take a long look in that deep, dark, truthful mirror and figure out why you're not sorry about the thing you did, Ryan.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh, yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
You obviously hurt them.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
You obviously cut them so deep.

06:07.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah, Ryan, I don't know, and maybe this has to do with just who we are and maybe it's the area of the country we were raised in or whatever, but I say sorry all the time about shit I don't feel sorry about.

06:21.000 --> 06:32.000
By and large, I've learned to be in a perpetual state of asking people for forgiveness for my actions, and that's just a price to do with this modern day America, my friend.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
It's like a super intense form of humility, right?

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
If you're not constantly shooting rainbows out of your ass, you should be apologetic for just not being awesome all the time.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
I've gotten to a point where it's just a knee-jerk reaction where someone's like, oh, man, I got stuck in traffic, and I'm like, I'm sorry.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
I had nothing to do with that traffic, but I feel bad that they got stuck in traffic.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I apologize for shit that I could never have any control over ever.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm sorry that this episode isn't very good so far.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
Or what else? Anything else you feel bad about?

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm sorry that I'm sure not all of our listeners had a great Christmas. I'm sorry for that.

07:17.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm sorry for assuming that all of our listeners are Christians, good Christian soldiers. I'm sorry about that.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
It saddens us to think of living in heaven for eternity without you guys, without all of you.

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah, I'm sorry that you won't be kicking it in heaven with me, JC, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. Is he dead?

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Man, how good is that jam band gonna be?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah, everybody just-

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I'll be on the recorder.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Who's that? You're playing recorder.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
SRV is on the Geetbox, obviously, and Jesus on the ones and twos.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
Can I be- I want Stevie Ray Vaughn to have a double neck guitar and I'll be on the bottom neck.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And he'll be like, Justin, I can't do it alone. Please.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Would it be kind of romantic? There would be some contact.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
If we tear into Texas Flood, I'm gonna be swaying.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Would it be cool if also his ten gallon hat was big enough for both your heads to fit inside it?

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
I think if it's heaven and we don't have rules, then I think that my head could fit.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
What if it is only big enough for one person and you try and get your head in there and it doesn't fit

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
and you start getting kind of bummed out, which isn't allowed in heaven.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
So Jesus points his finger at the hat and it doubles in size.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Or he points his finger at me and sends me to hell.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Hey guys, I stepped out of the room to grab a cup of tea. What are you guys talking about?

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
We're talking about Jesus's hat-expanding powers in heaven with Stevie Ray Vaughn and a jam band.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Again?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, we went way off track really fast.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm sorry about all that. I'm sorry that we went so far.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
2011, a year of apologizing.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And I'm sorry to Stevie Ray Vaughn.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah, I'm sorry to his ghost. His little ghost.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Play Texas Flood for me once, Stevie. That's my one song of yours that I know.

09:06.000 --> 09:19.000
Okay, four days ago I went on a blind date. He was very polite and seemed normal. Since then, I received no fewer than 35 texts, IMs, calls.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
What's a nice way to say you're creepy and desperate and I'm relieved you don't know where I live?

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
I mean, oh, Brooke Keele from Spring.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
I'm sorry that I'm probably that guy.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I'm sorry that that is Griffin.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm sorry that that is me.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
I think the best thing to do is, honestly, it sucks for you, but you gotta be direct.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
Because this is one of those situations where we talked about before, guys don't take hints very well.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
And if you're like, oh no, you gotta be like, straight up, it was a good blind date, it's not going anywhere, I would like you to leave me alone, please.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I mean, it's what you gotta do.

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
Right? The date seemed to go well, he seemed polite and normal, which is really, in this day and age, the only two qualities you can ask for in a person.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, maybe you're a little too demanding, Brooke.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
I mean, I don't know.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Well, no, because she got 35 messages she didn't want.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
In four days.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
You know he's interested.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
You know that book, He's Just Not That Into You?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
He's far, far too into you.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
He's a little bit too into me. Into you.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Well, that's a weird, like, 35.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
How do you not know that's too much?

10:29.000 --> 10:39.000
Honestly, I bet it's like a snake eating its own tail kind of thing where he did one and she didn't respond and he went, oh, now I need to cover up for that one that I did.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Oh shit, now I've done too many.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
And all of a sudden he's doing like 40 a day.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, that's a lonely, lonely tango you do not want to be a part of.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
You just gotta cut your losses at some point.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah, but man, we've all been there, right? You haven't had a GF for a while and then you get one and it's like, ugh.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
It's like water.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Water to a thirsty, thirsty man.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
You just don't know when to say enough's enough and your belly expands because you keep gulping it down.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
All the feminine attention.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
And in this, the year of our Lord 2010, electronic communication is so easy.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
I've sent eight text messages since we started recording the show.

11:17.000 --> 11:26.000
Which again, I'm sorry, that's probably why we haven't been so focused like our usual laser like intensity on helping people.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
So that's what it's about.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
You can get carried away.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
You can send like you can think you've only sent four text messages over the course of a week.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
But oops, it was actually 35.

11:34.000 --> 11:46.000
It's like eating corn chips, you know, Brooklyn, you don't want to do is ignore him because it's just going to make him want to try to get a hold of you more because clearly this guy doesn't know when to stop doing that.

11:46.000 --> 11:54.000
So you need to just let him know that it's not going to happen and it would be best if he just stopped contacting you.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Sure.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
You do have to put your proverbial foot down and it sounds like if he's polite and seem normal, this is going to go one of two ways.

12:04.000 --> 12:13.000
Either he's going to back down and problem solved or he is going to try to put you into a bag.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Yeah, he's definitely a psycho killer.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Like you've got to watch your back on this guy.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
You've got to get armed and then then get strict and say no more of this.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
No more calls.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
And if you come to my house, I'll shoot you with a rifle that I bought.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
Twenty eleven is going to be the best year probably since nineteen eighty seven.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
So I want you to be alive.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
I want you to I want you to cross that finish line and single through solo alive and single.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I think that's pretty.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
And not carved up like a roast beast.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
My best friend wants to get a good job but doesn't want to go through the hassle of college.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
How do I convince him that it isn't the 90s, 1980s anymore?

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
He really needs to get a sheet of paper before anyone will take him seriously lost in Baltimore.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Holy shit.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
You are in Goodwill Hunting.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
You are living in Goodwill Hunting.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It's like Baltimore Goodwill Hunting.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It's like the wire beats Goodwill Hunting.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I haven't seen I haven't seen Goodwill Hunting.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
What's it about?

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
It's about two friends taking Hollywood by storm.

13:18.000 --> 13:27.000
OK, enlisting the help of a wizard named Patch Adams, a wizard of comedy named Patch Adams and going on to Oscar Gold.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
It sounds like a fucking tight movie.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
It is fucking badass.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Is that on Netflix?

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
And what they do, they hunt Patch Adams throughout the course of the movie.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
It's pretty badass actually.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
This movie sounds incredible.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Every time they catch him, he gives them some Hollywood wisdom like, oh, like that.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Please tell me that was your Robin Williams.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Carve me off another slice of that, please.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
My Robin Williams is basically my dead knight.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Just FYI.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Oh, daddy.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
A little fancy, daddy.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
That's my dead knight.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Here's my Robin Williams.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Oh, oh.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Mr. Hammer.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That's not bad.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
It's kind of like Artie meets dead knight.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
Now, can you do Robin Williams doing one of Robin Williams' trademark voices?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Can you give me one of those?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Oh, did I?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Daddy.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
What's up, daddy?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Who's Danny?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Right back into dead knight from Daddy Shaq.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
OK.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It kind of vacillates.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Man.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Sorry.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
So this is what Good Will Hunting is about.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
OK.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
OK, it's two friends from Boston.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
But in our case, it's two friends in Baltimore.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
And through this story, I will give our writers some advice.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Two friends in Baltimore.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
OK.

14:42.000 --> 14:50.000
And they are learning about each other as adults and not just the young men they've

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
always been.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
One full of potential, like our writer's friend.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
And one who's a little slow on the uptake but still a sweetheart, like the person who

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
wrote us this email.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Is that who Robin Williams plays?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
No, he plays the wizard.

15:05.000 --> 15:13.000
And a few months later, they start working on a script for a movie about their own lives.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
And they meet a wizard who teaches them the ways of Hollywood.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
That's Robin Williams.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
OK.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
And then they go into Oscar Gold.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Like that's the whole flick.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I feel like there was a bleeding just now.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
I feel like maybe we glazed over some advice in there.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
No, that was all the advice I had.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
So find a wizard.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Find a wizard who is Robin Williams.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
He's like a metaphorical wizard but also a liberal wizard.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
You know what I mean?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Like he knows the secrets.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
Now for our writer, the person who wrote us this email, who I don't think is slow on the

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
uptake.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
I think he has just as much potential.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Numbers.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
You've got to get statistical on him.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
You've got to say, listen, if you go to college, study show, you will earn a million dollars

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
more over your lifetime.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
Or maybe he doesn't need to go to college for the job path he wants.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
What does he want to do?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Does he want to swallow swords?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
There's good money in that.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Well, I mean, do you think people just know how to swallow swords?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
No.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
They have to go to some form of higher educational institution and get that training, get that

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
on the job training.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Is that more of an apprenticeship though?

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
Because if you have really good grades in high school, what's great about sword swallowing

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
is if you have good grades and you get like, I think it's like a 30 on an ACT and around

16:38.000 --> 16:46.000
like a 1300 on the SAT, most colleges will afford you a full swallow ship.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Yeah.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Wow.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
That's a long way around.

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
The bad news is that if your friend is worried about the quote unquote hassle of college,

16:59.000 --> 17:05.000
chances are he's not going to farewell in the collegiate atmosphere.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
College is like the most fun.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
It's the best four years of your life.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
It really is.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
Or five years if you're me, but maybe some years it'll be the best of them.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
I wish I could go back.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
If nothing else, let him know that it's another four years without having to do real things.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
It's awesome.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah, the state will basically pick up the tab for you to go slack off for four years.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Yes, please.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Now I know we have collegiate listeners right now who are like, what?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
No.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Trust me.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Trust me.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Okay.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
It sucks balls.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I have no idea.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
You throw that hat in the air and when it comes back down to your hand, you are a different

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
person.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
If I have it in the air, it gets razors and comes down and slices your hand off.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
That's life.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That's the metaphor.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
And for some literal, don't go to that college.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
How about in 2011, everyone just goes to college?

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
Let's just all go to college or let's all agree to not go.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
One way or the other.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
One way or the other.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
We can't split it like this.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo answer?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I have a few.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
I would say I have a modest handful.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Okay.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Give me a sliver of one.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
People were busy opening gifts and I get that.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I get that.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
But we all drop the ball.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
We'll get it next year.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
We've all been there.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
This one was sent in by Action Allen though, our good Christmas soldier.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Thank you Action Allen.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mia who asks, how to clear negative evil energies from your

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
home?

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
My aunt has just left a very charming and alluring yet destructive relationship.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
She truly believes that Satan has been trying to get at her through the man she was seeing.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
She has now cut ties with this man and constantly wears her blessed cross, but she wants to

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
clear her home of the negative energies that he brought with him.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
What are some simple DIY methods of clearing her home of his nasty energy?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Wow.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
There's a lot of different concepts in that question.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.000
There's about eight or nine different theological ideas floating around in that query.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Jesus.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
A lot of ideas.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
A lot of thoughts.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
A lot of philosophies, both Eastern, Western, and Central.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Mm-hmm.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Wow.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Are there any answers?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Wow.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't think you can...

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I definitely think you can answer without offending somebody.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Well, I don't know because there is a...

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Somebody elected a best answer.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Okay.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
It's a little lengthy, so stick with me.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Burn sage.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Definitely.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Oh, this is by Jennifer B.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
Go to Wild Oats Whole Foods, and there are these smudging sticks.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
They can be like lavender or anything, but in ingredients, look for sage.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Burn incense.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
And, well, I don't know if your aunt's religious or not, but my cousin and me do this all the

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
time.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
But if you say the Saint Michael the Archangel prayer, it works for him all the time.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Here it is.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the wickedness

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
and snares of the devil.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, oh prince of the heavenly host, by the

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
divine power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who roam throughout

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
the world seeking the ruin of souls.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Amen.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Hope I helped, because with my job as a paranormal investigator, I run into negative spirits,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
and this has helped tremendously.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
If you have any more questions, please message me.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Thank you, Smiley.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Oh, I'll message you.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
You better believe we're messaging you.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
No joke.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
Like, just reading that, like the air seems, I don't know, the air seems brighter around

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
me right now.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
I think we should all agree that 2011 is going to be the year we finally take down the devil.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
I'm saying that 2010 was the shit, like the shittiest year ever.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I think we can all agree that 2010 sucked.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
I had high hopes for it by like January.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Sounds futuristic.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
January 14th, it was like, oh, Zolo's going to be a real bitch.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
But I don't know, I feel like I just got rid of some of 2010's funk.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
2010 was a bitch.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
2011, I think, is going to turn it up.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
But there was a lot of strife, a lot of, like not a lot of really cool things happening

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
in 2010.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Like, I thought it was kind of-

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
No, 2010 was full of some bullshit.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
How about that oil spill?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
How's the ocean doing?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Hey, how's your-

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
2010, thanks.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Hey, thanks.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Thanks.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
What else happened?

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Gay guys are in the military now.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
That's ruined.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Oh, thanks.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Robert C. Byrd died.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Robert C. Byrd died.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Oh, he's definitely in my heaven jam band.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
More like millifairy.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
He's on the banjo.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
No, he played the violin.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
He's an expert fiddler.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Yeah, shit.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I knew that.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
I have his record.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
But let's back up and acknowledge the fact that Travis just said millifairy.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah, that was good, Trav.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Hey, thank you guys.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
I worked really hard on that.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah, I was handcrafted.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Listen, we all get one this show.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Mine was Swallow Shit, which I stole from Kanye West.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
And Travis had millifairy.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
Justin, you still have one terrible pun left.

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
By the way, just to be clear, I think it's great that gay people are in the military.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Of course it's fucking great.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Why did it take so long, stupid?

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Hey, speaking of, not to get political, because I think that this is something anyone could

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
appreciate no matter what side of the political aisle.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
Tied into Senator Byrd dying is that West Virginia is not represented by Mr. Joe Manchin.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Former governor.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Former governor Joe Manchin, who just didn't-

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Didn't feel like it.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Didn't show up that day.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Had a holiday party to attend.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Did you?

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Did you have a holiday party?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
So he abstains from the Don't Ask, Don't Tell vote.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
And then like 20 minutes later he's talking to reporters like, yeah, I done fucked that

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
one.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
I done fucked that one right up.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I did bad.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Should have gone.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Should have gone.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
You know, should have repealed it.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Should have voted for that.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
You can't play that way, dawg.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Well, to be fair, he had already bought his white elephant gift, and he didn't have the

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
receipt for it anymore.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
So he had to go to that holiday party.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
He bought this really funny Snuggie.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
He was like, oh, damn it.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
I can't take it back.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
What am I supposed to do?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Come on strong.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Out the gate.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Okay.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Vote number one.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
First vote of your career.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Killing it.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Killing it.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
2010 was beef, man.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
I hated 2010.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
It sucked.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
It sucked.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
It was so bad.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
2011 I think is going to bring the fire.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
It's going to be that raw heat.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
That raw heat.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
I actually had a pretty good year.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Shut the fuck up, Travis.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Yeah, really.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
That's fair.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
That's fair.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
I am gay and out to basically everyone but my parents.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
So I was wondering how to make this a memorable and shocking experience for them, Robby.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh, I like this.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Yeah, I like this a lot.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Fuck discretion.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Also, fuck a guy named Timmy.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
Or go to a really crazy club and meet a guy named Discretion.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I'm Discretion.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Welcome.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Welcome to Shamanicans.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
My name is Discretion.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Hey, Discretion would actually be a pretty good gay bar name, too.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
You want me to go to your parents' house and tongue kiss you in front of your dad?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm happy to.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Contrary to my name.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
Having a full-on hedonistic Madonna freakout really is your only option right now.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Just show up with a ball gag.

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
A ball gag, like set up a chair made of boys in the front room of their house and just sit there waiting for them to come home.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
This is my man-servant, Discretion.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Yeah, or show up with blood all over your hands.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Uh-oh.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
All right?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Now wait for it.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
Blood all over your hands, sweating shirt untucked for the first time in your entire life.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
If you've ever seen your shirt untucked, you've always been so clean.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Immaculately dry.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Immaculate, really.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
You show up with blood everywhere.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Freak it out.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Say, I need somewhere I can hide a body.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
I need somewhere I can hide a body.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
And then embroil them in 20 minutes of believing they need to help you.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
See if you can get your dad to get you a chainsaw.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And they're on board with this.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
They're going to hide this situation.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And then just as you're about to leave, be like, psych, I'm gay.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
They will be so relieved.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
But what if they aren't?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Whoa.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Can I tell you?

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah, that could flip on you.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Whoa, whoa.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Can I tell you something that really scares me?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
What's up?

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
I was going to almost word for word say the exact same thing.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Oh, my Jesus Christ.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I know.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I think it's the best idea.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
2010 gets one little last stinkaroni in.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
One little last freak out.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, that's the best way, I think.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
I think if two out of the three of us think that that's a good idea, then it probably is, right?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Yeah.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
I don't know.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
I don't know.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Or actually kill a dude.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Just commit to it.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
That's the best.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Good.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
I think our show only has a few more murder endorsements we can do before some government

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
agency shuts us down.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
You think?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Well, yeah.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I think we should maybe keep those to a minimum.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
My brother and my brother and me started in 2010.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
That was a good year.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
But you know what?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
That was an equal and opposite reaction.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Yeah.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
2010 had nothing to do with that bullshit.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
That was us.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
We had to get...

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
No, it was like 2010 was so bad that we needed...

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Okay.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
If 2010-11 doesn't need us, what if we...

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Excuse me.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Did you say 2010-11?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
2011.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
No.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
The year 200 and...

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
I can't do all that.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
No.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
I have too much math for this early in the morning.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
I think it was the Somali pirates that set us off.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Yeah.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
That was earlier in the year, right?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
The Somali pirates happened.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
We were like...

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
The Somali pirates was bad.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
That was a bad start.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
We were like, fuck this.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
This year is going to be a real shit storm.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
We need to compensate with laughter and advice.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
And I feel like...

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
I don't know.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
I feel like we're doing the Lord's work over here.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
And I feel like we helped in some small measure, at least for ourselves.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
We have to have helped somebody, right?

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
I don't know if we actually helped anybody, but...

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Maybe helped people get a few chuckles.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Griffin.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
What?

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
I was thinking, you know, we...

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
It's Christmas.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
It's after Christmas.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
We shouldn't be stingy with the Yahoo Answers.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Let's just put another ladle of them on.

27:24.000 --> 27:32.000
You want to dip my brain ladle into the punch bowl of idiocy

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
and scoop out a refreshing glass of Yahoo?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Yeah.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
I can do all of that.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
This one was also sent in by Action Alan.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Thank you, Action Alan.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Betty, who asks,

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
What are some ideas for a divorce party?

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
What kinds of themes, music, party favors, etc. would be good?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
A boo?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
What?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Is this a thing?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Excuse me?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
I mean, apparently it's a thing.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Somebody on the internet is asking about it.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
A divorce party?

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
Is that like the worst surprise party ever?

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
It will be a surprise for somebody.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Oh, honey, all of our friends and family are here.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
What's the occasion?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Oh, I'm leaving you.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It's not working out.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
I'm going to stay with my sister for a while.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
She's here to pick me up.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
You have your family around to support you.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Bye.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
That's a very nice way to do it, because even if you get divorced,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
it's like, well, I'm already at this party.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
There's Chex Mix, so that helps.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Maybe I'll meet somebody nice.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
Chex Mix, you can fit into pretty much any theme party.

28:44.000 --> 28:51.000
A baby shower, a wake, a bar mitzvah, a bris.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
What's a bris?

28:53.000 --> 29:02.000
I think it's a party that Jewish people throw when the circumcision happens.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Oh, so it's a party for getting your wiener cut off,

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
which is actually, ironically, the exact opposite of a divorce party.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Or the same, am I right, women.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
That's what I was going for, but...

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
I didn't...

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
You got it?

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Because she's leaving you, so it's like you're going to put it back on.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
You're getting the hood of your penis put back on?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
You know, on King and Queens.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Can they do that?

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
Did you ever see that one on King and Queens?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Wait, excuse me.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Are you saying that there was an episode of King and Queen

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
in which Kevin James had his wiener chopped off and then sewn back on?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Had his circumcision...

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Well, it was an arc.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
I mean, it wasn't all repaired.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
How many episodes was that arc?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Was that sweets?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
It was like a 2F arc.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
It was like a season ender to be continued.

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
Do you guys remember that ad campaign between the third and fourth season

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
when there was a bunch of billboards with Kevin James with his penis stump exposed?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
And saying, what will happen?

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
And then, like, I don't know, George Costanza's dad was looking disapprovingly like,

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
ah, not again.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
And then Leah Remini was like, ah, get it back.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
So who in this situation cut off his wiener?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Was it a mystery?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Yeah, it was like...

30:17.000 --> 30:23.000
That was what provided the suspense at the button of the end of the first half of the arc.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Turned out it was Maggie Simpson.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Guys, this is the weirdest fucking episode we've ever done.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Yeah, that's saying something.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It's 2010, man.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
We're shaking out all the wretchedness,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
and then we're gonna be back in 2011 with, like, the fire.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Is that what it is?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Yeah.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I gotta say, it's a super shit episode.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
I think it's great.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I think we're getting rid of it.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
I think we're burning some sage.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Yeah, this is like the sage burning episode.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Getting our smudgy sticks out.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Yeah.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Metaphorical smudgy sticks.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
We're gonna shake off all this evil, this sin.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
This 2010, like, just garbage.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
And then we'll be back, you know, and here's the other problem.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Those post-Christmas blues, man.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Who doesn't have those?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Oh my god.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Tell me about it.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
You show up.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Santa came.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Next day, nothing.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
What if we just stretched out Christmas?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
I was thinking about this.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Till eight days.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Eight days.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Okay, this is good.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
This is good.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Eight days seems like a pretty good length.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
In fact, what if we made it not about Jesus at all,

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
and said about some oil?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
What if it was like a...

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Of course, if it was more like Hanukkah,

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
that would be better for everybody.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
More like what?

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
More like...

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Excuse me?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Huh?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
You know what I like?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Tops.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Tops.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
What if we integrated more tops into it?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And flat potato-based foods.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Yes.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Okay.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
I'm excited now.

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
We can name them after that character on Taxi, Locke.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
You know what I like?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Tell me.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
The music of Adam Sandler.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Okay, I'd do like that.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
Maybe we could get him to write the legal national theme song

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
for our holiday.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
To do this holiday we're inventing?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
This is all good so far.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
What should we...

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Christmas...

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Christmas...

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Christmas 2?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Is that...

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
See, that seems a little on the nose for me.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
What if we...

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Okay, hold on.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
What if we got a multi-pronged candle?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Okay.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
Just to like represent like an iconic thing, right?

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
And we put the gifts under that instead.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
And we call it Candle Nights.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Candle Nights.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
That sounds like an awesome holiday.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It sounds like the best holiday ever, right?

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
I would rather go to that holiday and burn in hell for all eternity

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
than have one day of that and get to go to heaven.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
But what if Candle Nights is the correct one?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
What?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
We don't know.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
We don't know.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Whoa.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
Whoa, you're saying that God has been upset about us celebrating the birth of his son

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
for so long and what he really wanted us to do.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
God, this is really spiraling.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Yeah.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
I don't want to lose the love of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
by celebrating the wrong party every December.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
If someone could just tell me the right party to celebrate.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I'm telling you what the right fucking party is.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
It's Candle Nights.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Candle Nights 2011.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Candle Nights doesn't celebrate anything.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
It's just like...

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You can celebrate whatever you want.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
I'm celebrating...

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Candle Nights doesn't discriminate.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I'm celebrating Jesus' birth.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
I'm celebrating the discography of lamb.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
You can do whatever you want on Candle Nights.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
I'm celebrating this sweet-ass Ninja Turtles watch.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Hey.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Hey.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Candle Nights says yes.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
It has Donatello's face and it pops open and it's just got a little digital readout.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
That's nice.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Did you get that?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Does Santa still come?

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Santa comes on Candle Night number six.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Why then?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Because he can't be...

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
The last two presents are obviously from your parents.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
And they're usually the bigger ones.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Candle Night number six, you usually get a surplus.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
You usually get about nine or ten different presents.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
But they're not very...

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
They're usually not very good.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
What kind of things are you talking about?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I'm talking about...

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
One of them's a bris.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
I'm talking about...

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Yeah.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, the bris is on...

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
The bris is on Candle Nights one.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Like right out the...

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Just to really, really get that out of the way.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
From the jump.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
It's all uphill from here.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Every candle night though.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
You gotta pay your dues if you're gonna do the rest of Candle Nights.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
So day one is bris.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
Day two is bris iced tea.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Crying.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Uh-huh.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Because you need some refreshment.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
You need to replenish your fluids after getting your...

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Your Kevin Janes.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
And if you...

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
You actually have to get a little bit sliced off every year, which is right.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Really old men celebrating Candle Nights actually have a cavity

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
in which they can store quarters up there.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
They just...

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
That's the worst mental energy ever conjured up.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Hold on a sec.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
How much is it?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
You need some gum?

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
No problem.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
Hold on.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
See, I don't want to celebrate this holiday anymore.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Did I ruin it for you?

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
I mean, if it's gonna require periodic brises, like...

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
No, annual.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
It's not like you're gonna sneak up on me.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
It's not a random bris.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
You can prepare for it.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Oh, but what if it was a random bris?

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
I feel like the cost would go up way, way more.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Like, mid-July, if your dad, like...

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Hey, good morning.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Come here.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Come here!

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Hey.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
Your dad shows up looking like Sweetie Todd.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Do you want gifts this year or not?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Do you want that Brisk Ice tea?

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Get over here.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
What year?

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
It's 2010.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
That means...

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
I thought it was more of a party game for night one.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Like, people just... everybody shows up, everybody gets a razor.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Good luck.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
What if on the...

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
I pictured it more with one of those cigar cutters.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
That would be ideal.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Is this racist?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
I can't tell.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I can't tell either, but I...

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
That's what 2010 has robbed from me, is the ability to tell things are racist.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
That's why we're getting it all out now and then leaving it in 2010.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Gotta leave it.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Gotta leave it behind.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
I think that should be everyone's motto for, like, the next three days.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Leave it in 2010.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Just get it all out.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Leave it in 2010, everybody.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
If you have a bad podcast in you and you just...

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
You just fucking leave that shit right in 2010.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Leave it in 2010.

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
Don't... like, if you got a guy who's texted you 35 times, leave it in 2010.

36:43.000 --> 36:49.000
If you're pretending you've never heard of Hanukkah before, just, like, wrap it up, put it under the tree, and burn that tree down.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Leave it in 2010.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Leave it in 2010.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Leave it.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Hey, Somali pirates, fuck you guys.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Fucking leave it.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Fuck you.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
You're in 2010 now.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Oil spill?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Not anymore.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Not in 2011.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Do you guys remember 2010?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
I don't.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I purged it from my memory.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I love it.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
I love it, too.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
I love it, too.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
You...

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Your parents don't know you're gay?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
They will in 2010.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Leave it.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Leave it behind.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Leave it in 2010.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Pronounce it in 2010, and then in 2011, you'll be straight.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
That's how it works.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
That's not how...

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
That's...

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Yeah, that's...

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
These are all behind.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
That's not exactly how it works.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Those fucking Somali pirates.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Discretion.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
They thought they had it.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Leave discretion in 2010, please.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Leave it there.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
That's where he belongs.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
He is not a good friend to you.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
He's not a good friend to you.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
He's using you for your body.

37:40.000 --> 37:47.000
So, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but a few housekeeping tips.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
If you want some more of this, it's at mbnbam.com.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
If you want to ask this question, all the methods are there.

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
Please subscribe in iTunes, or if the spirit leads you, unsubscribe.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
I can see how that would be a viable option.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
I'd like to thank everyone who's either emailed us or posted on Twitter pictures of their Christmas wreath treats.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Yeah.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
They all look beautiful.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
And your mbnbam gear.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Everybody got it for Christmas.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Everybody did.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
It was like the Turbo Man of shit.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
People loved it.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
People were getting it.

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
Like, did you see Arnold Schwarzenegger banged on my window at three o'clock on the morning Christmas Eve?

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
You got to have more t-shirts.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
Please, my son wants a brown t-shirt.

38:38.000 --> 38:45.000
And then in the other window, it was like, ooh, ooh, ooh, dinner.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
Could we remake Jingle All the Way with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robin Williams,

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
only instead of Christmas, it's for Candle Nights?

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
Robin Williams takes the Sinbad role like he can afford that.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
Like, that poor guy can afford to miss out on the work.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
The movie would be eight times longer.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
I would watch that.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
It would be like two of the Lord of the Rings special editions back to back.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Ken Burns presents Candle Nights.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
I feel like we could come up with a better title than just Candle Nights, though.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I don't think there is a better one.

39:21.000 --> 39:28.000
Give me Wic.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
God, 2010, you bitch.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
God damn it, Zolo.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I fucking hate you, Zolo, so much.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Can we just end the show and end the year?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Can I just go to bed for the next four days until it's the next year?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
I know.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
It's over.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Griffin, something.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Get that, like, just the worst one you got.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Let's shake it off.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Get it out.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
The worst one I have?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Yeah, the worst, like, least funny one.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
We're going to shake out 2010 the right way by failing.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
What if I just load up the front page of Yahoo Answers and read the first one?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Do it.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Sure.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Do it.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
Fucking do it.

40:03.000 --> 40:13.000
This one is by Yahoo Answers user Carrie, who asks,

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
How long have you used Yahoo Answers?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
I'm so sorry.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

40:25.000 --> 40:32.000
Kiss your dad and squirt on the lips and leave it to 2010.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Keep your heart, three stacks.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Keep your heart.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Keep your heart.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Man, these girls are smart.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Three stacks, these girls are smart.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Play your part.
