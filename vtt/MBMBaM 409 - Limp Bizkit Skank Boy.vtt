00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

00:47.600 --> 00:52.640
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.880
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:54.880 --> 01:02.480
Do-do-do-do-do-do. That's right, it's May, the end of May when we recorded this. Probably June

01:02.480 --> 01:06.160
by the time this one comes out, and everybody knows what that means is that it is summertime,

01:06.160 --> 01:11.600
time for barbecue, pool time, and of course, the Summer Olympics. Did you guys practice that

01:11.600 --> 01:16.000
little opening music bit? Because that was really good. Yeah, Juice and I call each other on the

01:16.000 --> 01:23.920
phone every week, and we say, okay, you ready? Three, two, one. Yeah, see? It was good again,

01:23.920 --> 01:28.800
you nailed it. Yeah, thanks. The summer can only mean one thing, the Summer Olympics are back,

01:29.440 --> 01:36.800
and I am so excited about these hot games. The games are out this year, got a bunch of new ones,

01:36.800 --> 01:42.960
and excited they're switching it up, and I haven't heard anything about it in the news,

01:42.960 --> 01:48.240
which I follow religiously, and that's kind of surprising, so not exactly sure where they're

01:48.240 --> 01:54.640
being taken place this year, and that's got me worried, but there's some new games, I bet,

01:54.640 --> 01:59.600
and I'm excited to see all the athletes back in the mix. I've actually read some theories on

01:59.600 --> 02:05.360
Tumblr that I'm pretty excited about. I saw one, and I hope that this pans out, but I saw one where

02:05.360 --> 02:11.280
they're gonna flip it this year and do the winter events at the Summer Olympics, and the summer

02:11.280 --> 02:19.840
events at the Winter Olympics. Sure, yeah, so dune skiing is gonna be fun, and then cold pool is the

02:19.840 --> 02:24.800
new one for the Winter Olympics. Yeah. Yeah, so it's Ryan Lochte, and he's trying to get in the

02:24.800 --> 02:29.840
pool, but he can't quite figure it out, partially because the water's frozen, but also because he's

02:29.840 --> 02:36.240
just a really sort of dumb individual. No, you don't mean that about Ryan, you don't know him

02:36.240 --> 02:42.320
personally. The media can spin all sorts of things. Yeah, yeah. I'm looking forward to sopping wet

02:42.320 --> 02:50.400
curling. Sopping wet curling is the sexual fantasy. I am looking forward to slick sticks. That's where

02:50.400 --> 02:57.840
you put two slick sticks in your feet, and you just slide your way on down the hill at top speed,

02:57.840 --> 03:03.040
rocketing down across the mountains and through the hills on slick sticks. It's the first one

03:03.040 --> 03:08.720
to grandma's house wins. Why are we talking about the Olympics? The summertime month is almost upon

03:08.720 --> 03:14.960
us, Justin, and that means that the calendar has turned over another page into another Olympics.

03:14.960 --> 03:19.440
I don't understand why you're getting fucking confused about it. It's not funny when we talk

03:19.440 --> 03:26.000
about the real Olympics. Why did we think we could invent new Olympics? I don't think I invented this

03:26.000 --> 03:32.160
Olympics, Justin. I think Julius Caesar did or some shit. Could we talk about how the Olympics are on

03:32.160 --> 03:37.600
rotation like Brigadoon and they only pop up if you are in the right place at the right time and

03:37.600 --> 03:42.080
the missed part and boom there's the Olympics and go get trapped in there because when they go away

03:42.080 --> 03:46.160
they'll take you with them. Yeah, if you're left in the Olympic Village after they shut off the old

03:46.160 --> 03:52.000
torch you sort of live there for another year until the next Olympics take place. Every year

03:52.000 --> 03:57.680
the Olympics appear in a location that no one knows and so it's always fun to hunt for the

03:57.680 --> 04:02.640
Olympics and all the athletes are getting ready because they know that once they start, like

04:02.640 --> 04:07.760
whatever the first event is, if they're not on the same continent as the Olympics, and they have been

04:07.760 --> 04:12.640
in the ocean, if they're on the same continent as the Olympics, they're going to miss their event.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.880
They don't have long to get there. Pretty sure this year they're taking somewhere new. I think

04:16.880 --> 04:23.360
they're going to get out to, you know, Casper, Wyoming. Oh, okay. Yeah, the summertime destination

04:23.360 --> 04:28.480
of the world, certainly of the United States. I'll be there, you know me. I'm there every year,

04:28.480 --> 04:34.080
me and Al Roker, and paddling around, tumbling around, wrestling. We like to wrestle with each

04:34.080 --> 04:38.800
other, not for the sport, but just like every time I see him we just sort of like make the pose and

04:38.800 --> 04:43.200
then we start sort of grappling right there on the ground and sometimes he wins, sometimes I win.

04:43.200 --> 04:49.840
I would like to propose something. I assume that the Olympics committee is listening. We collect

04:49.840 --> 04:56.560
a bunch of dirt, we dump it in the middle of the ocean, we form an island, and we call that island

04:56.560 --> 05:03.680
Olympics Village, and like you build your shit on there, and you just use that over and over again.

05:03.680 --> 05:08.000
We populate it with like the most capable, strongest, most beautiful athletes in the world,

05:08.000 --> 05:14.080
and every year we know where to go, we know where there's gonna be, and it answers to no country.

05:14.080 --> 05:21.360
AARON One issue I'm seeing, Travis. Shang Tsung's gonna find this place.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.400
Travis Oh shit.

05:22.400 --> 05:28.480
AARON Shang Tsung's gonna find this place, start using it as the new sort of connection to the

05:28.480 --> 05:32.160
nether realm, and gonna turn it into a Mortal Kombat.

05:32.160 --> 05:38.000
Travis If he's willing to pay, you know, to lease the space when they're not using it for the Summer

05:38.000 --> 05:43.760
or Winter Olympics, I mean, listen, the Olympics Village gotta make their nut somehow, so if,

05:43.760 --> 05:49.520
you know, if he wants to pay to have Mortal Kombat there in Spring and Fall, I think that's okay.

05:49.520 --> 05:55.600
AARON It bothers me every time the Olympics go to some big city that people already know about.

05:55.600 --> 06:03.120
Why can't it come here to Huntington, West Virginia? This is my pitch. Come here,

06:03.120 --> 06:11.200
build your slaloms, build your ramps, build your skateboard tubes, build it all here, and just

06:11.200 --> 06:20.000
leave it. The problem that you get in your Rio de Janeiro's and your soul's is that you put up your

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
ramp, and after two weeks, someone's like, actually, please move, this is where I park,

06:26.000 --> 06:33.680
this is where my, you know, you name it, laundromat, falafel shop, news agent, whatever you like,

06:33.680 --> 06:38.160
this is where that goes, and your ramp is in the way, please move it, Olympics. You put that in

06:38.160 --> 06:44.160
Huntington, I can guarantee, just leave it there. We'll find a use for it, thank you. We'll do

06:44.160 --> 06:48.400
something with it, and if you want to come do the Olympics here again, all your shit's already here.

06:48.960 --> 06:54.000
Why don't you just do them here again? No need to move them. One problem I see with that, Justin.

06:54.000 --> 07:02.240
You are just so nitpicky. Well, I want us to nail this fucker down. Okay. Shang Tsung moves to

07:02.240 --> 07:10.560
Huntington. Justin, can I also say, if you ever want to have just a fun YouTube dive, go on

07:10.560 --> 07:17.040
YouTube and search Abandon Olympic Villages, and you will learn that what you have just described

07:17.040 --> 07:24.240
is exactly what the Olympics already does. A lot of prep work, zero post work. Enjoy your ramp,

07:24.240 --> 07:30.080
idiots. We out. Olympics out. What are you gonna do with that ramp? I guess dry everyone's laundry

07:30.080 --> 07:35.920
on it, because it's your problem now. See ya. They tell him, we're gonna be back for this.

07:35.920 --> 07:41.920
Three and a half years, the world is gonna come back and get this ramp. So just leave it here,

07:41.920 --> 07:46.800
and the world will come back for it here in three and a half years. Our globe is littered with

07:47.360 --> 07:53.440
soccer fields nobody needs. Olympic detritus. That's why there's soccer so big all around the

07:53.440 --> 07:57.680
world is because the Olympics keep building them. There's all kinds of soccer places.

07:57.680 --> 08:03.760
So Casper, Wyoming, enjoy the soccer field. You can turn it into a fertile farmland maybe

08:03.760 --> 08:07.840
afterwards, but don't think about the after times. Think about the coming up times when

08:07.840 --> 08:13.520
all the medals are going around, and everyone, there's just so much jumping and throwing,

08:13.520 --> 08:18.320
and I'm psyched on my fucking gourd. So can we start the show now? It was 10 minutes. I think

08:18.320 --> 08:23.200
we've been pretty good boys, and I think we deserve it. Six months ago, I joined a small

08:23.200 --> 08:30.400
kickboxing gym. All the coaches are excellent, and most refer to us by name, during classes,

08:30.400 --> 08:35.680
or sparring. Due to my work schedule, I often attend a morning class that is fairly sparsely

08:35.680 --> 08:40.400
attended, often just me and one other student. It's always taught by the same coach. He definitely

08:40.400 --> 08:44.320
doesn't know my name, and it's gotten to the point where he knows it's too late to ask,

08:45.040 --> 08:49.440
and now he's gonna go through weirdly elaborate ways to avoid having to use it.

08:49.440 --> 08:54.000
It's given me contact social anxiety. Brothers, how do I let him know my name

08:54.000 --> 08:59.360
without embarrassing us both? That's from Panic Stricken Pugilist, Pennsylvania.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.960
I feel like this is an opportunity to use a phrase that is rarely used these days,

09:04.960 --> 09:10.320
but I think you could bring back, which is, you know, boldly proclaim you're going to do something,

09:10.320 --> 09:14.960
or my name isn't Travis McElroy. Oh, that's great. That was definitely

09:14.960 --> 09:19.520
invented for this scenario, which is good. Yeah. Oh, but it would really mess with him

09:19.520 --> 09:22.960
if you proclaimed, like, I'm going to bring in biscuits for everyone tomorrow,

09:22.960 --> 09:26.640
or my name isn't Travis McElroy. And then you don't bring in biscuits the next day,

09:26.640 --> 09:29.520
and they're like, wait, so is his name- What's his fucking name?

09:29.520 --> 09:32.480
Isn't Travis McElroy? Fuck. So take that one off the list, I guess.

09:33.040 --> 09:39.600
Sort of a similar thing. You could invent some power moves that have your name in them. So sort

09:39.600 --> 09:47.280
of like the Derrick Driver or something. You know what I mean? Like the Derrick Spin Kick.

09:47.280 --> 09:54.000
And it's like, here it comes, a Derrick. It's not a very good name. So like Derrick's,

09:54.880 --> 09:59.280
the Derrick, oh, the Derrick Dart. And you just kind of throw yourself at the person.

09:59.280 --> 10:03.440
You gotta shout it like you're a street, like you're Ryu from Street Fighter. It's just sort

10:03.440 --> 10:04.560
of like- Derrick Dart!

10:04.560 --> 10:09.760
And then you do it, and the problem there is that he's gonna think your name's Derrick Dart,

10:09.760 --> 10:15.120
which is fine. Business card that you hand to somebody right before you kick their ass?

10:16.400 --> 10:20.880
And I'm going to be your opponent today, and it just says Derrick Dart opponent.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.440
You have to stay within the bounds of the question. It would be weird for you to give a

10:25.440 --> 10:29.440
business card to somebody who has ostensibly known you for a while. So that would not fly.

10:29.440 --> 10:35.280
This is custom, Justin, for the art of kickboxing, is you show respect to your opponent by

10:35.280 --> 10:37.280
exchanging business cards.

10:37.280 --> 10:41.120
Personalized boxing gloves that say your name across the gloves.

10:41.120 --> 10:46.160
Oh, yeah, or backwards so that when you punch them. Oh, and the shoes can have the names on

10:46.160 --> 10:52.240
too. So when you kick them right in the torso, they look down and it says, property of Derrick

10:52.240 --> 10:52.800
Jemison.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.680
I know it's called kickboxing, but it feels weird that you're allowed to kick them, right?

10:57.680 --> 11:00.400
It just seems like you're trying to kick them and they're like, whoa.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.080
That's his feet.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.040
What?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.160
Powerful feet.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.680
What are you doing, kicking another human being? What's wrong with you?

11:09.680 --> 11:11.280
With those powerful feet.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.880
Who throws a shoe?

11:16.400 --> 11:21.440
My daughter threw a shoe at me this week because she was mad, and my reaction was,

11:21.440 --> 11:24.080
who throws a shoe? Honestly.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.880
And she did not get it.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.840
This kid.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.040
She prefers Borat.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.240
Y'all want a Yahoo?

11:30.240 --> 11:31.440
Honestly.

11:31.440 --> 11:37.440
This Yahoo was sent in by Esther Joy. Thank you, Esther. It's Yahoo Answers user question mark.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.920
I'm going to say Flo from Progressive Insurance asks,

11:39.920 --> 11:50.400
Would Apple sales be affected if Steve Jobs dropped the iPod on stage while presenting it for the first time?

11:50.400 --> 11:59.920
I would like to show you what we've been-

12:02.080 --> 12:07.200
This is you nerds at home, and you take your disc in and pop it in the Discman,

12:07.200 --> 12:12.000
and then this is how you nerds walk all gentle so as not to disrupt the disc spinning.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.160
What if I said fuck the disc?

12:14.160 --> 12:18.400
I'm so glad that I said that because I'd like to show you the iPod.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.960
This special little music toy is going to-

12:20.960 --> 12:22.320
Aw, damn it.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.280
Aw, damn it.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.480
Aw, beans.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.920
Miss Steve's big day.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.560
Aw, nerds.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.440
I've broken the music toy iPod.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.240
Oh, all the music's leaking out everywhere.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.240
All the songs are all over the stage.

12:36.240 --> 12:36.960
Oh my, oh my-

12:36.960 --> 12:39.440
Somebody get some brawny paper towels.

12:39.440 --> 12:43.680
Hey, there's a big puddle of Sister Hazel over there, everybody. Be real careful.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.240
How?

12:44.240 --> 12:48.800
Okay, there has to be some sort of behind the scenes technical wizardry happening

12:48.800 --> 12:50.960
because I've never seen any of this.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.040
I've never seen Jony Ive like,

12:53.040 --> 12:55.600
oh, look at this, and this is the iPhone 10.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.360
I gave it a little nubbin' up on top.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.880
It's like a dandy little hat.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.800
And what's good is you can brush the hat and,

13:00.800 --> 13:03.600
oh, fuck me, I did drop my music toy.

13:06.880 --> 13:07.520
It's never happened.

13:07.520 --> 13:12.720
There has to be magnets in the gloves or sticky glue on all the display phones.

13:12.720 --> 13:16.400
The only time it happened is with the special edition

13:16.400 --> 13:19.920
that was red and branded with U2 stuff.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.080
They did drop that one on stage,

13:22.080 --> 13:26.000
but then Bono just started playing his guitar to distract everyone

13:26.000 --> 13:28.080
and nobody noticed that it happened.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.360
Oh, that's, yes.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.520
Yeah, that's a little behind the scenes right there.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.280
That's why each Apple press conference ends with a concert,

13:35.280 --> 13:38.000
usually by a bad music artist,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.080
is they want to distract you just in case.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.440
So they have this lever they can pull.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.760
Tim Cook is like, here's the iPhone 8,

13:43.760 --> 13:45.760
and I've just thrown it high in the air accidentally,

13:45.760 --> 13:47.280
and it's exploded on the ground.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.800
Take it away, Imagine Dragons.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.440
And they're like, boom, and the bullshit.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.120
And you're like, whoa, what just happened?

13:53.120 --> 13:55.360
You're concussed almost by the bad music.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.840
Now, Griffin, you just threw the glove down

13:57.840 --> 13:59.760
at both U2 and Imagine Dragons.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.240
Anything you want to walk back for people at home?

14:02.240 --> 14:04.800
Yes, I will say that Foo Fighters, I believe, did one,

14:04.800 --> 14:06.800
and that band still shreds.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.160
Okay, one time I was at work at PetSmart,

14:10.160 --> 14:11.360
back when I worked at PetSmart,

14:11.360 --> 14:14.720
and I was pulling my iPhone out of my pocket, it slipped.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.760
I tried to catch it,

14:15.760 --> 14:18.320
but instead ended up spiking it into the ground

14:18.320 --> 14:19.840
as though I was angry at my iPhone,

14:20.400 --> 14:23.120
and it shattered into a bajillion pieces.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.320
I would like to see Tim Cook do that now,

14:28.320 --> 14:29.840
and then be like, just kidding,

14:29.840 --> 14:32.480
and pull an even better iPhone out of his pocket.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.240
The next iPhone, yeah.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.760
Technically, I think they did this

14:35.760 --> 14:38.000
at the last Apple phone press conference,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.840
where he was like, this is the iPhone 8.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.520
Looks a lot like the iPhone 7, huh?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.320
Is Imagine Dragons ready yet?

14:44.320 --> 14:44.880
They're not?

14:44.880 --> 14:45.200
Fuck.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.160
Okay, check this out.

14:47.040 --> 14:47.680
Smash.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.040
Here's the iPhone 10.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.000
We skipped 9.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.160
Bono, get out here.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.000
Bono, quick, quick, save me.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.160
Travis, you went through a few iPhones, memory service,

14:56.160 --> 14:58.560
because there was the one time we were at our aunt's pool,

14:59.120 --> 15:02.480
and our daddy was bringing your phone to you,

15:02.480 --> 15:05.200
and he did definitely drop it on the hard cement,

15:05.200 --> 15:06.400
and he picked it up,

15:06.400 --> 15:08.720
and then just continued the delivery,

15:08.720 --> 15:10.640
and tried to walk away real fast,

15:10.640 --> 15:13.600
and you were like, um, um, um, um, um,

15:13.600 --> 15:14.880
one moment, please.

15:14.880 --> 15:15.760
It exploded.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.120
That was my iPhone 3, I believe, if I remember correctly.

15:19.120 --> 15:19.760
Cool move.

15:19.760 --> 15:20.480
Cool move by dad, though.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.520
Was that at Aunt Brenda's house?

15:21.520 --> 15:22.720
That was at Aunt Brenda's house,

15:22.720 --> 15:24.880
and cool move by daddy,

15:24.880 --> 15:26.880
trying to sneak one past you,

15:26.880 --> 15:29.920
as if you would not notice the sizable chasm

15:29.920 --> 15:31.760
in the glass surface of the screen.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.880
It was super cool, dad.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.120
It was cool.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.240
If you're listening, dad,

15:34.240 --> 15:36.240
I haven't forgiven you, and I never will.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.960
But if you drop it on the stage,

15:38.960 --> 15:42.160
Tim Cook just tries to explode the iPhone 8,

15:42.160 --> 15:43.040
because it sucks,

15:43.680 --> 15:44.560
and then he picks it up,

15:44.560 --> 15:45.840
and he's like, oh, look at that.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.760
It's still good.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.440
Well, um, I guess-

15:49.440 --> 15:51.360
That's better for Apple Socks, right?

15:51.360 --> 15:52.880
If he drops it on stage-

15:52.880 --> 15:53.440
Yeah.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.280
Okay, is that better for Apple Socks?

15:55.280 --> 15:57.200
He drops it on stage, it's fine.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.120
Like, literally nothing happens.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.120
But you do realize that this company

16:01.120 --> 16:02.960
is in the hands of people,

16:02.960 --> 16:06.400
the sort of hands that will drop an iPhone

16:06.400 --> 16:09.680
at just the least opportune time possible.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.160
Right.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.040
That's going to shake my face, I think, as an investor.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.560
Okay, here's what I wanted to see.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.240
I want to watch a real time,

16:16.800 --> 16:18.400
like, tracking of Apple Socks

16:18.400 --> 16:20.160
as Tim Cook drops it,

16:20.160 --> 16:20.800
and there it goes down,

16:21.920 --> 16:22.160
right?

16:22.160 --> 16:23.680
But then he catches it on his foot,

16:23.680 --> 16:25.520
and flips it back up into his hand,

16:25.520 --> 16:28.400
and the fucking sock just goes through the roof.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.240
I think that the optics we need to avoid here,

16:32.240 --> 16:33.760
Apple, we're now doing this,

16:33.760 --> 16:35.200
and it's a paid service,

16:35.200 --> 16:37.040
so we'll send you an invoice,

16:37.040 --> 16:38.480
is it's got to be purposeful.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.160
It can't look like it has a slippery accident.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.800
I think that Tim says,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.080
here's an iPhone 11,

16:46.080 --> 16:47.520
we're so excited about this,

16:47.520 --> 16:49.040
sorry about that nubbin on top,

16:49.040 --> 16:50.800
we shaved it right off.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.920
And for the next part of my book report,

16:54.560 --> 16:57.440
I'm going to kick this thing's ass for about 10 minutes.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.880
And he does take his shirt off,

17:00.880 --> 17:03.520
and then he dropkicks the phone across the stage,

17:03.520 --> 17:07.040
and walks slowly to over where it lands,

17:07.040 --> 17:08.080
and then picks it up again,

17:08.080 --> 17:10.160
and kicks it right back to the other side of the stage,

17:10.160 --> 17:12.240
and repeats this process for 10 minutes.

17:12.240 --> 17:12.960
And then at the end,

17:12.960 --> 17:15.840
and he brings out Limp Bizkit to play along with it.

17:15.840 --> 17:19.360
No, no, Travis,

17:19.360 --> 17:20.000
at the end,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.200
he gets on the phone,

17:21.200 --> 17:23.520
shows it still works by calling Limp Bizkit

17:23.520 --> 17:24.560
to come out on stage.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.440
And then while he's still shirtless on the stage,

17:29.440 --> 17:33.120
and sweaty from the 10 minutes of phone kicking he just did,

17:33.120 --> 17:35.520
he just skanks it up there so fucking hard

17:35.520 --> 17:37.040
to Limp Bizkit's great songs.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.600
And they go on the road,

17:39.600 --> 17:40.800
and Tim's like,

17:40.800 --> 17:41.600
I'm actually,

17:41.600 --> 17:42.480
this feels good.

17:43.040 --> 17:43.840
This feels right.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.960
This is where I belong.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.520
I'm going to keep doing this with you, Limp Bizkit.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.360
I'm a Limp Bizkit skank boy now.

17:51.920 --> 17:52.880
Fuck off, I'm free.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.440
I want Tim to come out one year and say,

17:57.440 --> 18:00.640
hey everybody, two things to announce.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.680
One, I'm free.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.920
I travel around Limp Bizkit,

18:03.920 --> 18:05.840
and I'm fucking free as a bird.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.760
Second, your current phone is fine.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.440
It's fine, and I'm free.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.680
We couldn't come up with any new ideas.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.840
Just keep buying more of those, I guess.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.560
It's not a, yeah.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.600
Or don't buy them.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.560
You don't need them.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.440
I'm free.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.640
My name is Tim Cook,

18:20.640 --> 18:22.640
and I'm the dancer for Limp Bizkit.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.640
And I'm telling you that I'm free

18:24.640 --> 18:26.720
for the first time in my life.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.760
Your phone's fine.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.400
Tim Cook walks out and pulls just a Walkman

18:30.400 --> 18:33.120
out of his pocket with a Limp Bizkit cassette in it.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.640
He's like, this is all I need.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.840
You can still fucking jam to this.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.200
What are you, what are you talking?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.040
I've got, you need one cassette.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.560
Limp Bizkit, there it is.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.960
This is my one cassette of Chocolate Starfish

18:44.960 --> 18:46.480
in the Hot Dog flavored water,

18:46.480 --> 18:48.560
and this is all I fucking need.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.480
This tape fucking melts.

18:52.480 --> 18:58.800
Why would I want to make a phone call on my Walkman

18:58.800 --> 18:59.760
and interrupt my Limp?

19:01.680 --> 19:03.840
If I make a call, the Limp goes away.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.200
They're two separate products.

19:05.200 --> 19:05.840
Grow up.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.080
That would be a dope feature for iPhone 11

19:08.080 --> 19:09.600
is if it let you make calls

19:09.600 --> 19:11.600
while still listening to Limp Bizkit.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.560
I try not to take a shit on Steve Jobs' legacy, folks,

19:16.560 --> 19:19.200
but the biggest mistake he ever made in his life

19:19.200 --> 19:21.360
was making the iPod bigger

19:21.360 --> 19:23.360
than the storage you would need

19:23.360 --> 19:27.360
to hold Chocolate Starfish in the Hot Dog flavored water,

19:27.360 --> 19:29.440
and maybe one other Limp Bizkit track.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.160
But that's it.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.400
You don't need other records.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.160
This fucking melts.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.560
Hey, everybody, come up individually.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.960
Listen to my headphones.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.400
Like in Gordon's tape.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.280
Come up there and play you a Limp Bizkit song

19:45.280 --> 19:51.360
that'll change your life.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.240
Yeah, Tim.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.120
Tim, I like this.

19:53.120 --> 19:53.760
This is good.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.960
Dude, your nipples are huge, man.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.240
Do you want me to get that shirt?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.640
It landed on my wife in the audience.

20:07.200 --> 20:07.700
So.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.220
So.

20:11.760 --> 20:12.880
God Almighty.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.280
I have a new segment I wanted to try.

20:15.280 --> 20:15.780
Okay.

20:16.320 --> 20:19.280
And this will be more of a service.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.560
The world has had a lot of time to get things right and wrong,

20:22.560 --> 20:25.760
and what I want to talk about is Proverbs,

20:25.760 --> 20:29.280
not the book of the Bible, though we might duck in there.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.640
But I want to hear my brother, my brother and me

20:32.640 --> 20:36.000
take the great advice that has already come before us

20:36.000 --> 20:40.720
from all the great world cultures and wise people and whatever,

20:40.720 --> 20:45.760
and I want to bring it into the modern era with us here.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.960
It's called, this is Travis's name, Proverb Punch-Up.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.680
And I want to take some Proverbs,

20:51.680 --> 20:54.400
and I'd ask if you have a favorite proverb

20:54.400 --> 20:57.360
that you'd like us to sort of like update.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.320
You know, just let us know and we'll take a swing at it.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.720
But I thought we could just kind of get started

21:02.720 --> 21:06.320
and kind of try to bring the, make these modern.

21:06.320 --> 21:06.800
You know what I mean?

21:06.800 --> 21:08.480
Yeah, maybe no jokes on this one.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.840
Maybe like a real, like on a serious.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.040
Here's the first one I want to talk about.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.760
The pen is mightier than the sword.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.880
The pen is mightier than the sword.

21:18.880 --> 21:23.600
And what this is saying currently is like,

21:23.600 --> 21:27.280
you can write words that could do more damage than one sword.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.680
That's fine. Nobody has pens.

21:29.680 --> 21:29.920
Yeah.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.200
And even fewer people have swords.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.120
So this is no good.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.400
This, as an analogy, this is useless to us now.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.840
As a people, we need to move on.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.600
So how can we fix it?

21:41.600 --> 21:44.480
The pen is mightier than a sword.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.680
Do you know the origin of this one?

21:47.120 --> 21:50.240
It was Alexander Great.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.720
And he was up against the other army

21:52.720 --> 21:55.840
and they had so many swords and they didn't have any.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.600
And he said, oh shoot.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.240
And he pulled out his pen or his quill

22:00.960 --> 22:03.440
and he wrote down on an order form,

22:03.440 --> 22:06.320
I would like to buy a hundred swords.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.280
And so they filled it out and then all of a sudden

22:09.280 --> 22:11.760
his one pen, Justin and Travis,

22:11.760 --> 22:13.840
became a hundred swords just like that.

22:14.480 --> 22:17.280
Just like that with ship because he had prime, of course.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.520
See, I heard it was Abraham Lincoln

22:21.520 --> 22:25.760
was leading the north troops in the civil war against the south.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.200
He goes to the one great river

22:29.200 --> 22:32.320
where they sort of separates the whole country

22:32.320 --> 22:36.160
and they were, all the bad guys in the south

22:36.160 --> 22:39.360
had a bunch of swords, the curved ones.

22:40.720 --> 22:44.160
And all of his men had, was pens.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.240
They didn't have any guns.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.760
They didn't have any swords.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.960
They just had pens.

22:49.520 --> 22:52.640
And they were like, Abe, I know you cannot tell a lie.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.880
What are we doing here?

22:54.880 --> 22:58.560
Because it seems like we're about to get fucking wrecked.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.720
And he was like, no, don't worry, my man.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.880
The pen is mightier than the sword.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.240
You just have to sort of like, you know, get in there.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.520
You gotta jab harder.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.640
You gotta jab hard.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.080
You gotta strike first.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.400
You gotta be sneaky.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.640
But the pen can be in the right circumstances.

23:14.640 --> 23:18.080
Milder than, more powerful, mightier than the sword.

23:18.080 --> 23:23.120
See, I thought it was a young man named Sammy Clemons.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.080
He was looking at a sword and he was like,

23:26.080 --> 23:28.000
this is fucking boring.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.440
And then someone handed him a pen.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.800
And when he turned it and made it look like a chicken

23:34.800 --> 23:36.960
was walking across the road on the end of the pen.

23:36.960 --> 23:41.360
And he said, oh, this is mighty funnier than that sword.

23:42.160 --> 23:42.800
Okay.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.960
That young man grew up to be Mark Twain.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.240
Wow.

23:48.240 --> 23:48.560
Yes.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.360
Wow.

23:49.360 --> 23:49.680
Wow.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.080
Now, what I heard is comedian Dave Barry.

23:54.080 --> 23:59.360
Dave Barry, someone showed him an apple and said,

23:59.360 --> 24:00.400
this is a sword.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.320
And Dave Barry stabbed into the apple with the pen.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.400
He's like, well, I guess swords are shit.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.320
And so he says, based on this one observation,

24:10.320 --> 24:12.880
I can confirm that all pins are mightier than all swords.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.960
But we've lost the plot a little bit

24:14.960 --> 24:16.640
because how we update it.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.360
Fix it.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.640
Think about all the other things

24:18.640 --> 24:20.080
that must be mightier than the sword.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.040
You know what I mean?

24:21.040 --> 24:24.000
Like a big block or a pencil even.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.520
Maybe we update the proverb

24:25.520 --> 24:30.240
with just a complete power ranking of all extant objects.

24:30.240 --> 24:30.800
Okay.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.960
Just to let people know where they clock in.

24:32.960 --> 24:36.800
So sword would be, sorry gang, close to the bottom.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.560
Pen would not be in the top.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.040
Technology has evolved so much.

24:41.040 --> 24:44.160
I mean, God, bazooka, Thor's hammer.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.280
Those are just two things that I thought of

24:47.280 --> 24:48.720
off the top of my head.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.520
I mean, right there, the pen is mightier than the sword.

24:51.520 --> 24:51.760
Fair.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.040
The erasable pen, that's huge.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.320
So then you have to say the erasable pen

24:58.320 --> 24:59.520
is mightier than the pen

24:59.520 --> 25:02.640
because it does have the sort of corrective.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.200
Yeah.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.480
Maybe the proverb is just this then.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.600
The bazooka is the mightiest thing of all, gang.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.400
I like that.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.240
And then there's no question about it

25:10.240 --> 25:11.760
because there is absolutely nothing

25:11.760 --> 25:13.680
that can step to one of these beautiful tubes.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.360
Because if someone's got a pen and they're like,

25:17.360 --> 25:20.000
I've got this and you're like, I've got a bazooka.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.160
I hope you can write very fast

25:22.160 --> 25:24.960
and you have some sort of distribution network

25:24.960 --> 25:28.720
available to you because this is gonna be over quickly.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.080
I don't really know.

25:30.080 --> 25:34.080
Okay, but what if you use the pen to write broken

25:34.880 --> 25:36.080
on the bazooka?

25:36.080 --> 25:37.520
Because then they look at it, they're like,

25:37.520 --> 25:38.560
I'm not fucking with that.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.520
It could explode right there.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.840
Well, I kind of like this checks and balances though

25:43.840 --> 25:46.320
that we're establishing between pen and bazooka.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.280
It's just dumb.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.640
I could blow you the fuck away

25:48.640 --> 25:51.040
before you could get your piece of paper on my bazooka.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.080
This is kids shit.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.120
The bazooka wins.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.920
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.080
I'll look at my fucking horse you gave me

25:58.080 --> 25:59.360
wherever the hell I want to.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.160
You can look at a horse wherever you want.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.120
It's your horse.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.640
I don't see why you can't look.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.400
Don't you want to know what you're dealing with?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.000
See if it needs some dental care?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.280
This seems stupid to me.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.040
Do you know what I don't like about this aphorism

26:11.040 --> 26:11.920
and I never have?

26:11.920 --> 26:13.600
It's a negative, right?

26:13.600 --> 26:14.720
Give me a positive.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.280
Like, do look a gift horse in the eyes.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.640
Oh, you shouldn't do that though.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.200
Oh my God.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.080
Oh, no really?

26:20.080 --> 26:21.040
That's a huge mistake.

26:21.040 --> 26:21.440
Huge.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.080
Why?

26:22.080 --> 26:25.440
Because then it makes them feel like you're on the same level.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.880
If someone looks you in the eyes,

26:26.880 --> 26:29.120
that's going to drive you into some sort of battle fury.

26:29.120 --> 26:29.760
You don't want that.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.200
Well, but one in 10 times,

26:31.200 --> 26:32.880
that's your first step to Seabiscuit.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.560
Because you look them in the eyes and you connect.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.080
You say like, hey, they didn't appreciate you, but I will.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.320
Now run fast, you beautiful bastard.

26:40.880 --> 26:44.080
I'll tell you what's huge now is for teens today,

26:44.080 --> 26:45.440
is reverse psychology.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.640
Because if you tell a teen don't look in that horse's mouth,

26:48.640 --> 26:50.960
they're going to be in that mouth by sundown.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.080
So what you have to say is that I demand

26:54.080 --> 26:56.880
you look in that horse's mouth right now.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.560
And then people will see that and be like,

26:58.560 --> 26:59.600
fuck this system.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.800
And they won't do it.

27:00.800 --> 27:01.280
Yeah.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.720
What if you put a picture of a horse's mouth on Instagram

27:04.720 --> 27:06.160
and they're all going to see it?

27:06.160 --> 27:06.960
Shit, that's funny.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.640
Isn't that good?

27:08.640 --> 27:11.600
How about we make it a little bit more of like a test, right?

27:11.600 --> 27:12.480
And you make it like,

27:12.480 --> 27:15.120
oh, looking on horse's mouth, up to you.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.680
We get John Quinones near that horse and he says,

27:17.680 --> 27:19.920
oh, I see you looked in the horse's mouth.

27:20.480 --> 27:21.040
Have a seat.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.240
The early bird catches the worm.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.840
This one's pretty good still, I think.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.840
I think it does work.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.360
Early bird catches the worm.

27:29.360 --> 27:29.920
Worm.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.240
But the super-duper late bird that's so late

27:32.240 --> 27:35.440
that it's the next day is there before the early bird.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.200
Yeah, time means nothing.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.160
Yeah, time means nothing.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.360
Time is an illusion.

27:39.360 --> 27:41.200
Early bird catches the worm.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.200
The late bird will figure it out.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.560
Something, I mean, they're doing something.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.840
They're going to eat a late bird.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.840
Late bird will get a late worm.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.480
You know what I mean?

27:48.480 --> 27:50.960
Like, there's worms in the fuck everywhere.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.280
Yeah.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.360
There's not just one fucking worm.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.280
That's a good, I like that aphorism.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.960
There's not just one fucking worm.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.400
There's plenty of worms.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.280
And this bomb I just invented is going to get them all out of the ground.

28:02.080 --> 28:02.320
Yeah.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.920
How about this for a proverb?

28:03.920 --> 28:05.280
There's plenty of worms out there.

28:06.240 --> 28:09.440
How come, how come there's plenty of fish in the sea

28:09.440 --> 28:11.840
but there's not plenty of worms in the dirt, right?

28:11.840 --> 28:16.080
How come it's not like the early hawk catches the one fish in the water?

28:16.080 --> 28:17.600
Like, that doesn't make any sense.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.040
There's lots of worms.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.880
There's worms everywhere.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.320
Just get a different worm.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.840
Here's the thing we can twist it though.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.200
The easy twist here, the late worm stays alive.

28:27.760 --> 28:28.320
Yeah.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.680
So it's just a question of what you are, a bird or a worm.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.240
And me, I'm a dirty, nasty worm.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.080
Wriggling around the ground, eating up dirt and dookie in the ground.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.760
I love this.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.960
There's plenty of worms.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.000
That's a proverb, right?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.600
There's, there's plenty of worms.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.240
Plenty of worms.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.360
Get there when you get there.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.560
There's plenty of worms.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.720
There's like 30 worms.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.280
I think it's better if we attach a specific number to it.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.640
Okay.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.200
That's good because that, you can't sleep all day.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.560
You do have to wake up eventually.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.800
But like, so the proverb is just like.

28:58.800 --> 28:59.280
There's 30.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.240
There's like 30 worms.

29:00.240 --> 29:00.720
There's 30 worms.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.520
Not like.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.560
We got to be definitive.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.280
30 worms.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.400
There are 30 worms.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.320
There are 30 worms.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.280
That's a good proverb.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.320
We're gonna get that on a t-shirt.

29:08.320 --> 29:08.640
Okay.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.760
There are 30 worms, comma, don't be the 31st bird.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.920
Uh, yeah.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.640
No, that's great.

29:16.080 --> 29:16.240
Right?

29:16.240 --> 29:19.280
Because that establishes like, you do need to get there.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.800
But you don't have to be the first.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.680
It's okay.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.440
Just don't be the 31st.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.760
I mean, you'll eat something, right?

29:25.760 --> 29:27.760
Oh, that's good.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.280
That's good, Justin.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.480
It's gonna be something.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.000
Maybe it's a mealy worm.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.960
There are 30 fresh, good, good worms.

29:34.960 --> 29:39.280
When God, when God makes a worm get eaten, he gives you another worm.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.040
Yes, so there are 30 good fresh worms.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.520
Try not to be the 31st bird.

29:45.520 --> 29:49.040
But if you are, there will probably still be some options available.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.720
A weird, sick worm.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.720
You might have to eat a caterpillar today.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.560
That you despise.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.120
I love that.

29:55.120 --> 29:55.760
Because you know what?

29:55.760 --> 29:56.480
It's pithy.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.240
It's brief.

29:58.240 --> 29:58.880
I love it.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.360
Yeah, it's even better than the last one.

30:01.360 --> 30:01.840
Excellent.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.920
All right, let's take a break real quick and we're gonna head into the Money Zone.

30:05.920 --> 30:06.880
Can we do a review?

30:06.880 --> 30:10.400
Like an after show sort of review of that new segment?

30:10.960 --> 30:11.920
Okay, yeah.

30:11.920 --> 30:15.840
I think that's really up to the listeners if they want us to fix their problems for them.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.440
You know, everything's gonna be hard at first.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.960
It's about growing and learning.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.480
What did you learn from that?

30:20.480 --> 30:23.120
That it was a great segment and you're a beautiful, creative mind.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.880
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

30:24.880 --> 30:32.560
Perfect.

30:36.560 --> 30:40.880
Our first sponsor this week is Casper.

30:41.680 --> 30:46.000
It's a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of products to create an exceptionally

30:46.000 --> 30:48.800
comfortable sleep experience one night at a time.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.240
We've told you all about Casper.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.360
You know we're huge fans.

30:51.360 --> 30:56.560
I love sleeping in the Casper mattress in our guest room when I'm sick and don't want

30:56.560 --> 30:57.760
to infect my family.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.440
So that is a treat that I look forward to being sick.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.720
But Casper is also a great mattress for anytime sleeping.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.800
Even when you're healthy, Casper is right there for you.

31:09.920 --> 31:14.400
But I just love it and it's great also to open the box and see it kind of unfurl.

31:14.400 --> 31:19.040
It feels a little bit like magic, which I think we can all use a little bit of in our

31:19.040 --> 31:20.080
day-to-day lives.

31:20.080 --> 31:26.720
Casper brand mattresses combine multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface

31:26.720 --> 31:29.760
with the right amount of both sink and bounce.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.720
What's the right amount?

31:30.720 --> 31:31.600
Shh, don't ask.

31:31.600 --> 31:31.920
Ten.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.960
Ten sink, eleven bounce.

31:35.520 --> 31:40.240
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

31:40.240 --> 31:44.800
Get the mattress, sleep on it for three months for crying out loud.

31:44.800 --> 31:49.040
And if you don't like it after three months, I mean that would be wild.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.920
Of course you'll like it, but if you don't, you can just send it back.

31:51.920 --> 31:59.520
Get $50 towards select mattresses by visiting Casper.com slash my brother and using promo

32:03.440 --> 32:05.040
Can I please talk about me undies?

32:05.040 --> 32:05.760
Yeah.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.720
They are the fun, comfy undies that feel as good as they look.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.320

And you know, you're thinking, I don't want to wear a tree.

32:21.840 --> 32:25.680
They make it soft, so don't stop attacking me.

32:26.400 --> 32:30.080
This naturally soft fiber, it makes a fabric that won't sag down or ride up.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.520
I'm wearing a pair right now.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.120
Got black and white spots all over it.

Holy shit.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.600
No joke, this is amazing.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.160
Public speaking is many people's greatest fear.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.880
But when your brother, sister, child, best friend, whoever gets married, guess what?

33:18.880 --> 33:19.840

33:48.880 --> 33:50.640
This is brilliant to me.

33:51.200 --> 33:55.040
Is there a partner website called Secret Toast?

33:55.040 --> 33:58.240
And this is toast I keep under my desk and it's not yours, Janus.

33:58.240 --> 34:02.080
I know it smells like burnt bread and jam over here, but mind your own beeswax.

34:02.080 --> 34:02.960
Janus.

34:02.960 --> 34:03.440
Janus.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.840
I have a message from Clopar.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.280
It's from Felrin.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.360
This says in a nasally voice, please.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.040
Well, you're the boss.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.600
Hey, weird legs.

34:16.160 --> 34:22.720
I paid the McElroys to distract you long enough to have my army of dippy bird robots,

34:22.720 --> 34:26.880
Koalaac, and Clopar clones take over your dimension.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.440
You're losing it, Justin.

34:29.440 --> 34:34.640
Don't you dare team up with Betty, Jenny, and Mimnim to try to take it back.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.960
You'll never get past the security goats.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.600
Later, loser.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.120
Think that's XOXO.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.400
XOXO, you're right.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.040
Thank you.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.080
Happy birthday to that loser Dalton, too.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.400
Did I do that?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.280
Yeah, you did.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.080
You did do it.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.200
We all heard it.

34:51.200 --> 34:55.600
Preferred time frame on this was six weeks ago.

34:55.600 --> 35:01.920
So happy birthday, Dalton, and good luck on the next one that is just around the corner.

35:01.920 --> 35:02.240
Sorry.

35:02.880 --> 35:06.160
Here's a message for Caitlin and it's from Ammo.

35:06.160 --> 35:10.880
And it's a big Adventure Zone spoiler, which is fun new style of content for the

35:10.880 --> 35:12.400
Jumbotron spots on the Bim Bam.

35:12.400 --> 35:17.360
So if you haven't listened to Adventure Zone and you want to, or even if you don't want to,

35:17.360 --> 35:19.120
you're going to want to at some point, I bet.

35:19.120 --> 35:23.120
So go ahead and skip ahead or turn down the volume for the next like 10 seconds.

35:23.120 --> 35:23.600
Here we go.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.240
You are the loop to my berry blue jeans.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.640
Let's be neck romantic together.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.720
That is a sweet message.

35:32.720 --> 35:37.280
And I'm sorry that a few people probably turned down their car speakers and didn't hear it.

35:37.280 --> 35:42.160
But to put it in sort of non-spoilery terms, they love each other.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.200
How's it going, everyone?

35:43.200 --> 35:44.160
I'm Oliver Wang.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.280
And I'm Morgan Rhodes.

35:45.280 --> 35:49.120
We have a brand new show on the Maximum Fun Network that we'd love to share with you.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.240
It's called Heat Rocks.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.880
Morgan, we should probably explain what a heat rock is.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.920
It is a banger, a fire track, true fire.

35:55.920 --> 35:56.960
Right, dope album.

35:56.960 --> 36:01.280
Each episode, we will bring on a special guest to join us to talk about one of their heat rocks.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.400
It might be a musician.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.120
A writer.

36:03.120 --> 36:03.920
Maybe a scholar.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.880
I mean, I would have been happy to just talk to you about your heat rocks.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.240
But this is a different show.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.120
Yeah, I think people might enjoy hearing maybe the guests instead.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.360
To do that, you'll have to go to MaximumFun.org.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.920
So if you want to talk about hot music, you should check us out.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.480
Heat Rocks.

36:17.680 --> 36:22.000
This weekend, I was in an apartment store and in the clearance section, there were men's underwear.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.080
I only spotted one pair that I liked and I started making my way to the checkout counter

36:26.080 --> 36:29.920
when I realized that in buying a single pair of underwear and nothing else,

36:29.920 --> 36:35.360
the checkout lady would almost certainly think that I had recently pooped my pants,

36:35.360 --> 36:36.880
which I did not, I swear.

36:37.680 --> 36:41.680
I circled back around and grabbed a second pair of underwear that I did not like,

36:41.680 --> 36:43.360
just to save the embarrassment.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.000
Was this all in my head or did I make the right move?

36:46.000 --> 36:50.080
That's from not so soggy bottom boy in corduroys.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.600
No, the problem is you've just sent the message to the checkout person

36:53.600 --> 36:56.720
that you have recently pooped your pants and you're planning on doing it again.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.480
That is exactly what I was gonna say.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.400
Strike again.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.000
They'll be like, do you need a bag for this?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.920
And then you say, no, I've got a bag.

37:03.920 --> 37:07.040
And you pull up an empty Chipotle bag that you had on you

37:07.040 --> 37:10.720
and that will sort of drive this illusion home completely.

37:10.720 --> 37:14.640
And then go back in 10 minutes later and buy another pair of underwear.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.560
Just keep going back in.

37:19.360 --> 37:24.400
But is there a limit at your establishment?

37:24.400 --> 37:25.280
What is your limit?

37:25.280 --> 37:32.720
I think the way to avoid any suspicion here is to shop as leisurely as you possibly can.

37:32.720 --> 37:35.360
Maybe even saying out loud, I am in no rush.

37:37.600 --> 37:44.160
Okay, I also want to point out, you are gonna buy one pair of underwear

37:44.160 --> 37:47.360
and you're like, if I just buy one pair, they're gonna think I pooped my pants.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.320
What should I, I've got it.

37:50.880 --> 37:53.040
A second pair of underwear.

37:53.040 --> 37:56.880
Like there are many items you could have like tacked on

37:56.880 --> 37:59.840
that would have just upset the narrative completely.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.560
Because the problem, like I worry about this.

38:02.560 --> 38:06.480
If you go right into, if you go to Rite Aid, right?

38:06.480 --> 38:11.280
And you lay down a huge container of toilet paper,

38:11.280 --> 38:14.160
they're gonna think, oh, this guy has to shit really bad.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.880
He came in just for this because he got to shit so bad.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.400
He's not thinking ahead.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.840
He needs to do this right now.

38:19.840 --> 38:25.360
Now, if you get the toilet paper and like sugar-free gummy bears,

38:25.360 --> 38:29.440
they're gonna think, well, whatever he's buying with it

38:29.440 --> 38:31.520
must be something that makes him shit a lot.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.760
Because he's buying toilet paper with it.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.920
I would assume this guy's got big plans.

38:37.200 --> 38:39.760
The only solution, here's what you should have done.

38:39.760 --> 38:43.360
You should have bought the underwear, but also a t-shirt,

38:43.360 --> 38:47.040
a button-up shirt to go over it, a pair of pants, a pair of socks,

38:47.040 --> 38:50.160
and a pair of shoes, and laid them all out on the counter

38:50.160 --> 38:51.280
like that as you bought it.

38:51.280 --> 38:54.080
So it looked like you were buying a whole outfit,

38:54.080 --> 38:55.520
maybe even a hat, right?

38:55.520 --> 38:58.080
You're buying a whole outfit in one go.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.280
Problem there, Trav, is not Shang Tsung.

39:02.400 --> 39:06.560
It's that I would just assume it went everywhere.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.040
Oh, you pooped your whole outfit.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.360
I pooped my body is the problem.

39:11.360 --> 39:14.560
So I think what you do is you walk up with the one pair of-

39:14.560 --> 39:15.680
Like you had a blowout.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.800
Yeah, you walk up to the counter with the one pair of underwear

39:19.760 --> 39:22.640
and you make eye contact with them the whole time.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.840
This part's important.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.520
And you don't have to spend other money

39:25.520 --> 39:27.520
just to fucking prove something.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.120
You just look them in the eyes and you say,

39:29.680 --> 39:30.240
I didn't-

39:30.240 --> 39:34.240
I didn't.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.040
Place the one pair of underpants on the counter and say,

39:37.040 --> 39:38.480
can you gift wrap that?

39:38.480 --> 39:40.080
Oh, that's great.

39:40.080 --> 39:40.880
Real good.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.640
I'll wrap a lot of gift wrap around

39:42.640 --> 39:46.400
so it'll take me about 15 minutes as the crow flies to get it unpacked.

39:46.400 --> 39:50.960
I won't be at any sort of rush so you can make it as fancy as you want.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.640
Maybe you could announce,

39:52.640 --> 39:58.720
please leave the tag on because I'm going to show my partner the style

39:58.720 --> 40:03.680
and I don't know if they'll enjoy the style of these boxer shorts.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.440
So please leave the tag on because I have a partner

40:07.440 --> 40:10.000
who's very choosy about my undergarments.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.520
So leave the tag on, please, because I might return them.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.880
And when I do, I will be well within my rights to do so.

40:16.880 --> 40:17.840
Oh, no.

40:17.840 --> 40:18.880
Ultimate power move.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.400
Halfway through checking out, just say,

40:20.400 --> 40:21.040
no, you know what?

40:21.040 --> 40:22.800
In fact, I don't need these.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.400
And then walk out of the store.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.000
And they'll come back.

40:26.000 --> 40:26.240
Yeah.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.240
Waddling.

40:28.240 --> 40:30.720
They'll know that not only did you not poop your pants,

40:30.720 --> 40:34.320
you are confident you're not going to between there and home.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.680
I told my partner about the style of these boxer shorts

40:37.680 --> 40:41.360
and they insisted that I return and purchase them posthaste.

40:41.360 --> 40:41.760
Yes.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.280
I sent them a picture and they said,

40:43.280 --> 40:45.920
oh, yes, that will be very flattering.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.440
And so here I am.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.280
You know how partners are.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.640
Maybe you could buy one pair of underwear

40:52.640 --> 40:55.840
and then while they're checking you out, whisper under your breath,

40:55.840 --> 40:57.120
maybe you shit your pants.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.160
I'm buying these for you.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.280
Did you shit your pants, Cashier?

41:03.920 --> 41:07.600
I'm buying these for you because I think you shit your pants.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.640
That's good.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.960
They'll get so defensive about it,

41:10.960 --> 41:13.600
they won't have the chance to sort of judge you.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.000
Yeah.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.360
Also, I will take this impulse purchase funny coffee mug.

41:17.360 --> 41:18.240
Thank you very much.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.200
The danger with that one is you got to get yours in

41:21.200 --> 41:22.640
before they get theirs in.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.600
So maybe while you're even just 15 feet away,

41:25.600 --> 41:27.200
approaching the register, just be like,

41:27.200 --> 41:29.440
smells like you shit your pants.

41:29.440 --> 41:29.920
I didn't.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.400
You could also walk up and give them the underpants

41:34.400 --> 41:37.120
and you say, you can check out

41:37.120 --> 41:38.880
and then you lift up the underwear

41:38.880 --> 41:41.360
and you pretend like you're having a lot of trouble lifting it

41:41.360 --> 41:43.440
and you go, oh God, do you guys do delivery?

41:44.800 --> 41:48.800
An ultimate I'm never going to shit my pants confidence move, right?

41:48.800 --> 41:53.200
Buy the underpants and a pair of sheer white linen pants.

41:53.920 --> 41:54.560
Yeah, right?

41:58.240 --> 41:59.920
I'll tell you what move I like, boys.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.160
You walk up to the registry,

42:02.160 --> 42:03.440
you got this one pair of underwear,

42:03.440 --> 42:05.520
you hand it to them, they beep it.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.760
They say, that'll be $7.99, please.

42:07.760 --> 42:10.720
And you say, I shit my pants.

42:13.680 --> 42:14.800
Listen, no, shut up.

42:17.040 --> 42:21.600
I shit my pants and I don't have my wallet.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.680
Can you please, please?

42:23.680 --> 42:24.640
My boss is here.

42:24.640 --> 42:27.200
My boss outside, my boss outside.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.440
I shit all over my pants, please.

42:29.440 --> 42:32.080
And they say, oh my God, you don't have your wallet?

42:32.080 --> 42:34.880
And you say, no, my wallet at house.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.000
I have other underwear there.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.560
I wouldn't need these if I had it, please.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.920
And they say, okay, just take it.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.000
Take it, take it, take it, take it and go.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.200
Do you need to use our bathroom?

42:43.200 --> 42:44.880
And you say, no, I change in a car.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.720
And then you go outside with your free underwear you just got.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.400
And you Kaiser Soze away.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.400
Yeah, you waddle up to the register,

42:54.400 --> 42:56.240
do this scheme and you waddle away.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.440
But then they see you outside.

42:57.440 --> 43:04.800
Shhh, rotten proud, $8 richer.

43:04.800 --> 43:05.520
How about a Yahoo?

43:06.160 --> 43:09.440
Yeah, I would love to do a Yahoo, Griffin.

43:09.440 --> 43:13.200
Okay, here's one that was sent in by Grayson Harlow.

43:13.200 --> 43:13.920
Thank you, Grayson.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.240
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

43:16.240 --> 43:19.440
I'm gonna call him Biverly asks,

43:21.040 --> 43:23.760
is it okay to eat some sandwiches in church?

43:23.760 --> 43:26.480
Hmm, no additional details here,

43:26.480 --> 43:32.640
but you have some sandwiches and it's noon time

43:32.640 --> 43:34.960
and the creature's really ripping and roaring.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.320
And you think, I'm not gonna make it.

43:38.320 --> 43:41.280
I need to eat some of these, some sandwiches right now.

43:42.080 --> 43:42.640
Yeah.

43:42.640 --> 43:46.320
Is it okay to just start chomping down on these?

43:46.320 --> 43:50.240
Or do I need to wait for the, you know, to be dismissed?

43:50.240 --> 43:54.480
Or is it possible to maybe slump one down real fast

43:54.480 --> 43:56.560
during prayer when nobody's looking?

43:56.560 --> 43:57.840
And then if they do come up to you, you're like,

43:57.840 --> 44:01.040
did you just eat two egg salad sandwiches during the prayer?

44:01.040 --> 44:02.880
You say like, I guess you weren't looking, huh?

44:02.880 --> 44:06.320
Hey, I guess you don't need anything from God, huh?

44:06.320 --> 44:06.720
Okay.

44:08.320 --> 44:11.440
Huh, I guess the question, Griffin, the important question,

44:12.240 --> 44:14.640
what's on the sandwich?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.880
Because there are definitely some answers to that

44:18.880 --> 44:21.040
that make it more okay than others.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.080
Like peanut butter sandwich, fine.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.920
Peanut butter sandwich doesn't bother me.

44:25.920 --> 44:28.560
But like, if there's some like sloppy meats on there,

44:28.560 --> 44:30.000
I don't know how I feel about that.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.840
Sloppy sinful meats, you mean?

44:31.840 --> 44:32.400
Yeah.

44:32.400 --> 44:33.200
Yeah.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.520
Anything cured is of the devil.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.160
Sure.

44:36.160 --> 44:40.480
I was in Ironton on Monday for the 150th

44:41.360 --> 44:42.640
Ironton Memorial Day Parade.

44:42.640 --> 44:45.520
It's the longest continuously running Memorial Day Parade

44:45.520 --> 44:47.600
in the country and I went to the Shake Shop on my way out

44:47.600 --> 44:52.560
because when you roam, you go to the Shake Shop in Ironton.

44:52.560 --> 44:58.640
And I was waiting for 100 years for my milkshake

44:58.640 --> 44:59.520
and my ice cream.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.400
And a woman who looked like she just came out of church

45:02.400 --> 45:04.960
came up to the counter to pick up her order.

45:04.960 --> 45:09.360
And judging by the foil, it was a single hamburger

45:09.360 --> 45:10.880
is what it looked like to me.

45:10.880 --> 45:13.520
It was one single large hamburger.

45:13.520 --> 45:16.720
And I did not hear her during the ordering process.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.400
So I can only extrapolate.

45:18.400 --> 45:21.680
But when the woman behind the counter handed her this

45:21.680 --> 45:24.960
what appeared to be a sandwich, she said, and I quote,

45:24.960 --> 45:28.640
I put as much mayonnaise on there as I thought was safe.

45:29.760 --> 45:33.280
But if you need more, come up and I'll give you a cup.

45:34.080 --> 45:34.480
What?

45:34.480 --> 45:36.960
That's the worst thing I ever heard, Jesus.

45:36.960 --> 45:43.120
What possible codicil, what collary could you have put

45:43.120 --> 45:47.840
on your order that would make someone so eager to please

45:47.840 --> 45:52.560
vis-a-vis and so confident that they had not vis-a-vis mayonnaise?

45:53.440 --> 45:56.000
What possible direction could they have been given?

45:56.000 --> 45:58.400
It sounds to me, J-Man, like the direction was

45:58.400 --> 46:02.080
give me a reckless, dangerous amount of mayonnaise.

46:02.080 --> 46:02.400
Yeah.

46:02.400 --> 46:05.440
And the person behind the counter was like, no, no, not again.

46:05.440 --> 46:08.560
I put as much on there as I thought was safe.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.280
Safe.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.400
Because I thought it was safe.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.000
That is what she said, safe.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.560
But if you need more, come up and I'll give you a cup.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.280
That's the worst part?

46:15.280 --> 46:16.800
No, no, we can't jump over that part.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.000
It's the worst fucking part.

46:18.560 --> 46:19.120
A cup.

46:19.120 --> 46:23.200
And I'll give you probably a plastic ramekin of mayonnaise.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.280
This person definitely means in a church service,

46:28.240 --> 46:31.200
like a Sunday church service and not physically in the building, right?

46:31.200 --> 46:33.520
Because we grew up in the Baptist Church

46:33.520 --> 46:36.960
and we had a fucking lot of sandwiches in that building.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.320
Yeah, no, I think a lot.

46:38.320 --> 46:42.400
I think they're talking about the sermon of the Lord's time.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.440
Here's the key to eating a sandwich during church.

46:46.160 --> 46:49.200
You got to pick your crinkle times.

46:49.760 --> 46:53.120
You can't just be sitting there and in a silent moment of prayer

46:53.120 --> 46:57.920
and reflection just as you open your subway $5 footlong.

46:57.920 --> 47:00.160
Got to pick the moments when everybody says like,

47:00.160 --> 47:02.880
amen, you can peel a corner then.

47:02.880 --> 47:03.680
You know what I mean?

47:03.680 --> 47:03.920
No.

47:03.920 --> 47:04.800
It's going to be slow.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.600
Know the long hymns.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.440
Talk to the minister of music beforehand.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.240
Just say, how many verses of Amazing Grace are we busting out this set?

47:12.240 --> 47:13.680
Three whole verses?

47:13.680 --> 47:15.600
Shoot, yeah, bud.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.280
Catch yourself there, don't cuss.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.520
Yeah, I can definitely squeeze in a sandwich.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.600
Up from the grave he rose.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.320
That's the moment.

47:22.320 --> 47:25.280
Because people are going to be having such a big fun time with that tune

47:25.840 --> 47:27.840
that you could just hide in the back,

47:27.840 --> 47:29.920
scratch down behind a pew,

47:29.920 --> 47:31.440
treat yourself, enjoy it.

47:31.440 --> 47:31.920
Yeah.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.680
Don't do it during communion

47:33.680 --> 47:35.680
and they come around with crackers and you say,

47:35.680 --> 47:36.560
no, I'm good.

47:36.560 --> 47:39.040
I planned ahead.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.680
Or you take a couple of crackers

47:42.480 --> 47:48.240
and you take a little Lunchable Meat and a little Lunchable Cheese.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.200
How thoughtful.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.240
And the minister says, if you don't stop doing that,

47:52.240 --> 47:54.640
I'm going to ask you to leave religion.

47:54.640 --> 47:57.680
And you say, I'm still doing it, aren't I?

47:57.680 --> 47:58.960
It still counts.

48:00.800 --> 48:03.200
I just use it as a topping.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.960
I don't see what the problem is.

48:04.960 --> 48:07.600
My salad lacked crunch and pizzazz.

48:07.600 --> 48:10.400
It's a food hack, Mr. Pastor.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.080
So calm down, why don't you?

48:12.880 --> 48:15.200
And here's another secret that they don't tell you.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.960
You can request whatever drink you want in communion.

48:18.960 --> 48:22.160
So if you want like, you know, you want some, I don't know.

48:22.160 --> 48:23.520
Sprite mix.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.040
Yeah, you can get some Sprite in there.

48:25.040 --> 48:26.880
You can get some San Pellegrino.

48:26.880 --> 48:28.880
Welcome to Church Hacks with Travis.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.240
Yeah, well, okay.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.240
I guess only Travis gets the Church Hacks.

48:32.240 --> 48:32.560
Yep.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.160
Here's a Church Hack.

48:34.160 --> 48:37.040
If you go in the Kiwanis room when everybody else is in there

48:37.040 --> 48:39.680
listening to the sermon like dummies,

48:39.680 --> 48:41.920
they probably had donuts during the day

48:41.920 --> 48:43.040
and you could just sneak in there

48:43.040 --> 48:45.680
and pilfer to your little chubby hearts content.

48:45.680 --> 48:46.640
Church Hacks.

48:46.640 --> 48:47.360
I'll tell you a secret.

48:47.360 --> 48:47.840
Church Hacks.

48:47.840 --> 48:50.240
I'll tell you a secret place you could eat a sandwich during church

48:50.240 --> 48:53.760
and that's in the sort of prep room for the baptism.

48:53.760 --> 48:55.280
So you're gonna need to go up to the pastor

48:55.280 --> 48:57.760
pretty much every week and say, I need a-

48:57.760 --> 48:58.640
I fucked up again.

49:00.160 --> 49:00.960
I need a tuna.

49:00.960 --> 49:03.120
You know what?

49:03.120 --> 49:05.200
This time I really understand it.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.000
Yeah, I get it.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.560
This time I'm really, really ready to dedicate it.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.120
So I need you to juice me up.

49:11.120 --> 49:12.080
Let me in there.

49:12.080 --> 49:13.760
It's like, I love your spirit.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.200
I love your initiative.

49:15.200 --> 49:18.480
Every time after the service, I go in there, clean up.

49:18.480 --> 49:20.080
It smells like the stickiest ham.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.120
Is something happening that I don't know about.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.960
And the best part of doing it this way

49:24.960 --> 49:26.800
and doing it with a baptism every week,

49:26.800 --> 49:28.640
you don't even have to worry about cleaning the mustard

49:28.640 --> 49:30.000
and crumbs off your face.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.080
That doesn't get taken care of by the bath.

49:32.080 --> 49:32.560
Sure.

49:32.560 --> 49:37.200
Do you think that if Subway started off advertising

49:37.200 --> 49:40.240
soft paper for church, that that would be-

49:40.800 --> 49:45.200
People would think that that was like a heathen thing

49:45.200 --> 49:48.320
or they'd be so stoked that somebody was talking about church

49:48.320 --> 49:49.920
that they would just kind of roll with it

49:49.920 --> 49:52.720
and stop going to Chick-fil-A and just start going there.

49:52.720 --> 49:54.080
How do you think that would shake out?

49:54.080 --> 49:56.320
Okay, you give me an idea, Justin.

49:56.320 --> 50:00.640
A partnership between church and Subway, and we set it up

50:00.640 --> 50:03.120
like the Alamo Drafthouse where you can sit there

50:03.120 --> 50:06.240
and your peer, you just like stick a little card in a thing

50:06.240 --> 50:08.240
and a sandwich artist comes by, they grab it,

50:08.240 --> 50:09.920
they come back to you, they hand you a sandwich

50:09.920 --> 50:12.720
in soft paper that you can eat during church.

50:13.280 --> 50:16.560
Now, the benefit to church here is services

50:16.560 --> 50:18.960
will become three and a half hours long,

50:18.960 --> 50:22.320
but you can get a sandwich during it

50:22.320 --> 50:24.400
and also maybe forgiven or whatever.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.480
You're welcome, church, we fixed it again.

50:26.480 --> 50:27.920
I think church would be stoked

50:27.920 --> 50:29.920
about Subway's participation in this.

50:29.920 --> 50:34.240
And the thing I'm basing that on is how stoked everybody is

50:34.240 --> 50:38.080
for Dennis Quaid since he was in the I Can Only Imagine movie.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.680
And now they're like, we got a Quaid, the good one?

50:41.680 --> 50:42.880
Always liked Quaid.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.280
I've always loved Quaid's.

50:45.280 --> 50:49.520
Well, Dennis, I don't know about Randy, what is he even?

50:49.520 --> 50:51.760
Is there a third Quaid we don't know about?

50:51.760 --> 50:53.040
Hold on, let me look.

50:53.040 --> 50:53.840
Hold on, let me look.

50:55.040 --> 50:55.920
Third Quaid.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.560
Thanks everybody for listening to my brother,

50:58.560 --> 50:59.280
my brother and me.

50:59.280 --> 51:00.800
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.480
Justin, hold on, let's see if Travis finds the third Quaid.

51:04.480 --> 51:06.800
No, I'm gonna move, I'm gonna charge right ahead.

51:06.800 --> 51:10.800
We're gonna be in Phoenix, I think this is the only,

51:10.800 --> 51:14.880
well, no, we're gonna be in Phoenix, Arizona this June.

51:14.880 --> 51:15.680
All Quaids.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.600
We're doing a couple shows before that in San Francisco,

51:17.600 --> 51:20.000
but I believe those are sold out

51:20.000 --> 51:22.640
unless I am completely mistaken.

51:22.640 --> 51:25.280
I mean, Dennis Quaid has several children.

51:25.280 --> 51:25.760
That doesn't count.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.520
You cannot attend those,

51:27.520 --> 51:30.880
but you can come to see us, Phoenix, Arizona Symphony Hall.

51:30.880 --> 51:33.040
That's Saturday, June 16th.

51:33.680 --> 51:36.400
We are also gonna be in Orlando, Florida

51:36.400 --> 51:40.320
at the Walt Disney Theater on Friday, August 31st

51:40.320 --> 51:44.480
and Atlanta, Georgia at the Cobb Energy PAC,

51:44.480 --> 51:47.440
Performing Arts Center, I assume, doing my bim bam.

51:48.960 --> 51:51.520
I just found a Rick Quaid on LinkedIn.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.160
Ooh.

51:52.160 --> 51:54.320
If you're the Adventure Zone fan,

51:54.320 --> 51:58.080
we're going to be in, Travis has not updated these to say

51:58.080 --> 51:58.960
which are sold out.

51:58.960 --> 52:01.440
We're gonna be in New York, Cincinnati, Boston and San Diego.

52:01.440 --> 52:01.840
I think-

52:02.480 --> 52:04.320
Last I checked, Cincinnati and San Diego

52:04.320 --> 52:05.920
were the two that still had tickets.

52:05.920 --> 52:08.240
Okay, so you should come see us at those.

52:08.240 --> 52:13.280
McElroyShows.com slash Tours is the spot

52:13.280 --> 52:16.240
where you can get all those tickets.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.400
We're doing a sort of collaboration

52:18.400 --> 52:19.600
with a mysterious package company.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.280
This is also Adventure Zone themed,

52:21.280 --> 52:24.720
but it's called Tacos Correspondence School of Wizardry,

52:25.440 --> 52:27.280
Cantrips and Other Magics.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.760
If you go to bit.ly forward slash Tacoschool,

52:29.760 --> 52:33.440
T-A-A-K-O school, you can sign up for that.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.280
It's gonna be like a narrative experience

52:35.280 --> 52:37.360
that you have via the mail

52:37.360 --> 52:38.880
with a lot of cool little things

52:38.880 --> 52:41.200
and some new audio that we've recorded.

52:41.840 --> 52:43.360
There's like an audio component to it.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.280
It's gonna be really neat, but it's worth checking out.

52:45.280 --> 52:47.520
Bit.ly forward slash Tacoschool.

52:48.080 --> 52:50.000
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

52:50.000 --> 52:50.960
for the use of our theme song.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.680
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

52:53.680 --> 52:55.920
It is a great soundtrack for whatever you're doing.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.560
Washing dishes, driving in the car,

52:59.120 --> 53:02.080
furiously Googling for people with the last name Quade.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.200
Whatever you want.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.440
Thank you also to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

53:05.440 --> 53:06.720
You can go to MaximumFun.org

53:06.720 --> 53:08.240
and check out all the great shows there.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.520
Shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself, Lady to Lady,

53:11.520 --> 53:13.920
Switchblade Sisters, Jordan, Jesse Go,

53:13.920 --> 53:15.200
all kinds of shows there.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.480
And if you want to hear more stuff we do,

53:16.480 --> 53:18.720
it's all at McElroyShows.com.

53:18.720 --> 53:23.040
Oh, speaking of, a new special project at MaxFun called Bubble.

53:24.640 --> 53:28.160
It's a series that Jordan Morris wrote

53:28.160 --> 53:31.600
and that a bunch of people are doing some voice acting in,

53:31.600 --> 53:33.920
including these three McElroy brothers here.

53:33.920 --> 53:35.040
So that should be coming up soon,

53:35.040 --> 53:37.120
but you can find it in iTunes now

53:37.120 --> 53:40.160
and go ahead and hear one, the promo for the show,

53:40.160 --> 53:41.840
and two, go ahead and subscribe to it

53:41.840 --> 53:43.840
so you can get all the episodes.

53:43.840 --> 53:47.760
It's like a podcast sitcom if you can believe such a thing.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.480
Yeah, it's a sci-fi drama sitcom.

53:50.480 --> 53:51.360
Dramedy.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.320
Drama.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.400
They really did all the genres for this one.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.480
So that's gonna be great.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.920
And do you all want the final?

53:58.800 --> 53:59.200
Yeah.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.160
Yeah, you know I do.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.440
Final Yahoo!

54:01.440 --> 54:03.120
Sent in by Carl Vincent Boddy.

54:03.120 --> 54:03.680
Thank you, Carl.

54:03.680 --> 54:04.880
It's Yahoo Answers user.

54:05.920 --> 54:06.880
Sorry, something's going wrong.

54:06.880 --> 54:09.840
So there's a hat trick for Yahoo being a big piece of shit.

54:10.400 --> 54:11.920
Sorry, there's a banner at the top of the page

54:11.920 --> 54:14.400
that says we are undergoing maintenance for a few hours.

54:14.400 --> 54:16.960
Some features may be temporarily unavailable.

54:16.960 --> 54:21.120
What maintenance do you need to perform Yahoo

54:21.120 --> 54:22.720
on your service nobody uses?

54:23.600 --> 54:24.160
It's fine.

54:24.160 --> 54:24.880
It's fine as the way it is.

54:24.880 --> 54:27.280
It's perfect as is, as evidenced by the fact

54:27.280 --> 54:28.640
that this username doesn't show up.

54:28.640 --> 54:31.440
I'm gonna call him Carlson asks,

54:33.600 --> 54:36.000
who else right now is shirtless and chomping

54:36.000 --> 54:38.720
on a huge hunk of cheddar cheese like I am?

54:43.120 --> 54:44.560
My name is Justin McElroy.

54:44.560 --> 54:45.760
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:45.760 --> 54:47.280
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.640
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

54:48.640 --> 54:49.520
Kiss your dads.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.600
Oh, they're on the lips.

55:08.800 --> 55:10.720
Maximumfun.org.

55:10.720 --> 55:11.760
Comedy and culture.

55:11.760 --> 55:12.880
Artist owned.

55:12.880 --> 55:17.360
Listener supported.

55:17.360 --> 55:18.160
I love it.

55:20.560 --> 55:22.480
Well, I hope that you're enjoying this podcast

55:22.480 --> 55:24.960
you're listening to as much as we are pretending to.

55:24.960 --> 55:27.600
But anyway, why not listen to another podcast too?

55:27.600 --> 55:29.040
It's called The Flophouse.

55:29.040 --> 55:33.920
And on our podcast, we have recently watched a movie,

55:33.920 --> 55:37.840
often a bad movie, and we review it on our podcast,

55:37.840 --> 55:39.600
but mainly talk about other stuff.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.360
And I don't know, hang out.

55:41.360 --> 55:42.480
It's all about hanging out.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.320
Feeling like you're being with your best friends.

55:44.320 --> 55:45.440
Who are your best friends?

55:45.440 --> 55:46.480
Us three.

55:46.480 --> 55:47.360
Dan McCoy.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.360

55:49.360 --> 55:50.480
Stuart Wellington.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.880
Owner of the best bar in Brooklyn, Hinterlands.

55:52.880 --> 55:54.240
And Elliot Kalin.

Former head writer of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

55:59.760 --> 56:00.320

So many things.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.920
Author of the upcoming children's book.

56:03.920 --> 56:05.280
All right, that's enough.

56:05.280 --> 56:07.440
The Elliot's credits just go on and on.

56:07.440 --> 56:09.760
Yeah, but if you like the idea of listening

56:09.760 --> 56:12.080
to three funny guys talk about bad movies,

56:12.080 --> 56:14.480
then why not come over and listen to The Flophouse?

56:14.480 --> 56:17.040
It's available at MaximumFun.org

56:17.040 --> 56:19.680
or wherever fun podcasts are found.

56:19.680 --> 56:42.720
So get out of here.
