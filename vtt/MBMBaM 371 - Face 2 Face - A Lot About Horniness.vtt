00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:48.000 --> 01:09.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Step on my applause.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm your baby's brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
And I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy. Fuck you.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Getting started quick.

01:29.000 --> 01:38.000
Like the Chilean miners emerging from their mysterious hole, we have returned to the great district of Columbia.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Great district you got here.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Maybe the best district in the whole country.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
This district I know about.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
The capital... end.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
Do you all get peeved, do you get seriously teed-o when like people in Austin are like, it's the live music capital of the world?

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Y'all should be like, you can't just say that. We're the capital capital.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah, wait, are you the capital capital of the world?

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
You're the terrifying press conference capital of the world.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
I've never... I have yet to see a press conference come out of DC where I'm like, oh, great.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
It never starts with, we did it!

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
Okay, so, we were in Brooklyn yesterday. Was anybody at the New York show yesterday?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
That was a lot of people.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
We usually travel by plane whenever we do multi-city tours, but we took the Amtrak down from...

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
A lot of Amtrak employees here.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
To their credit, it was extremely chill.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
It was fucking great.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
I actually had a moment where I was like, are they gonna tell us to put our seatbelts on and our tray tables up?

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
Once you get seats, of course, because the moment when you don't have seats is... when you're traveling with eight people is harrowing and terrible.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
We need to talk about... this is technically a one-man intervention for the two of you.

03:13.000 --> 03:22.000
Because your train behavior, it left something to be desired.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Is there something specific you're referring to here?

03:25.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay, the entire time we've been together, all of us and the family will be hanging out talking about real shit.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
And then these two will just launch into a deep Poirot talk.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Just do a deep Poirot dive into the, I guess, mysteries. I'm not well-versed.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
And when we were on the train, these two were so fucking sure a murder was gonna happen.

03:57.000 --> 04:08.000
So the entire time, like, Travis got up to go to the dining cart and would come back with a coffee and Justin would bust out a little notebook and be like, 9.50 a.m., Travis went to coffee.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
Travis did literally say to me when I went to the dining cart, when I got back, just so you know, 9.35 to 9.43, in case you need an alibi.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
I guess you assumed each other was the killers?

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah, because it's always someone they've mentioned. The book never ends with, it was that guy.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
That's a definition of a cozy mystery, Griffin.

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
There's two I've been reading, it always happens on a train. The thing I'm most impressed by in Poirot books, everybody knows the minute things happen.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
That's true. Everybody's able to say, well, I was there at 9.42. I'm like, are you just checking constantly?

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
See, Travis, back then, in the olden times, clocks were like TVs.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
So that was the most fun thing you had to do, be like, oh, I've never had a 10.17 just like this before.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Can't wait to see what 10.18 has in store.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Probably some sort of illness that will kill me.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Probably cholera. Hope I don't get murdered.

05:14.000 --> 05:25.000
The reality of a train murder is that trains are so big that a murder could have happened like four cars in front of us, and we would never have known.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
A train could have happened in the quiet car, and I'd be like, shh.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
That's the perfect crime. Hold on, let me write that down.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Who did it? Shhh.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm going to sound like Eddie Vedder here, but can we get some more monitor, because the echo's a little rough. Thank you.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Thank you so much.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Okay, should we start doing the shit?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Sure.

05:51.000 --> 06:03.000
So we are going to do some questions and some yahoos and some stuff, and then towards the end of the show we'll take some audience questions, and I take it that everybody knows the rule for that.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
No honor!

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Thank you. And don't start lining up, we'll call on people.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
We'll call on people. Yeah, yesterday the Brooklynites got very horny for it, and it was like a TED talk.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
We didn't even measure the horniness in here. Are y'all horny for this one, or what?

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
Horny meters off the charts! That's three boners! We've never gotten that far!

06:33.000 --> 06:48.000
God knows that when I am horny, what I do is, yes! It's happening!

06:49.000 --> 07:01.000
The alternative is the entire audience, and please God, this is not a call and response, I'll leave this stage, but if the entire audience was like, ohhhh, let's do it.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Or just silence. How horny are you?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Justin, hit me with that first question.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Thank you for bringing me this podcast I've never listened to, and so basically it's just three brothers talking about how horny they are and what that sounds like?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Yo, no, this is an important distinction. We're not horny at all.

07:22.000 --> 07:41.000
No, I could not be less horny. I'm a little horny. Two months ago, I worked a table for my library consortium at the county fair.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
What's that? That's some Justice League. Library consortium?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
The library consortium.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
The League of Books!

07:48.000 --> 07:58.000
I worked for the League of Books. I took a walk to get a lemonade, and a gentleman manning one of the carnival game booths said hello to me as I walked by.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
I said hello back.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
There's your first mistake.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
They're just trying to get your attention.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
And I said hello back, and then as I continued to walk away, he said, what kind of family you got?

08:09.000 --> 08:17.000
I have polled a lot of people, and no one knows what this phrase means.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
Is it a pickup line? Is it a conversation starter? Is it a code phrase for carnies?

08:25.000 --> 08:34.000
I deeply regret not asking the man himself for the moment. I may never know the answer. Any ideas? That's from Still Confused in Cataragas.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
You here?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Hi!

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Wait, what kind of family you got?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Hey, what kind of family you got?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Can I ask one thing? How badly did I butcher Cataragas?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Hell yeah! What's up? No scope!

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
What kind of family you got?

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
I cannot think of a sentence that the meaning of it changes more depending on the tone of the delivery.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
That's true, because there's like a youth pastor delivery.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
There's a youth pastor delivery, I mean the wording is criminal.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
But it could be just, what kind of family you got? And it's just like asking like, you know, are you married? You got kids?

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
It's I guess a succinct way of answering a bunch of questions all at once, but there's also a like...

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
How horny are you kind of way?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
What kind of family you got?

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
Maybe you're playing, maybe you're playing some kind of like family card trading game?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
What kind of family you got?

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm playing some swamp energy on my son, Jeremy.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm sorry, my Jeremy's tapped this route.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
I tapped my Jeremy.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Go uncle.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I have a blue-eyes white Jeremy.

09:52.000 --> 10:02.000
Okay, that's all well and good, but what kind of family you got?

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
What if the answer that that person's hoping for is like, bad, take me away.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Take me to Des Moines with you when you go.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Okay, let's look at this in the lens of a carnival professional.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Give me a second.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Okay.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
All right, go on.

10:22.000 --> 10:31.000
Why do they need, what information do they need for carnival activities that could be answered?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I mean, it's a grift setup.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Yeah, right.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
There are very few carnival games that I feel like are like, oh, I've got a fair shot at winning this one.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Everybody without an uncle only has to knock over two milk bottles.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Like, it doesn't make any sense.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
I guess it also doesn't make sense that like, am I, are you trying to figure out if it's a wealthy family?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Or a very gullible family who loves SpongeBob SquarePants?

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
What kind of family got stupid and rich enough to keep buying frogs to flip into those stupid late pads?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Let's do it.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Keep the frogs coming, my good man.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
I have a grandpa who's very proud and confident he can roll the bowling ball up the rails to make it stop in the divot just right.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
When that will not be the case.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Let me get him.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Let me get him right now.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Let me get him.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Hold on, let me round him up for you.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
They all want to try to flip frogs in there.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
They all want to win a goldfish.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
How about a Yahoo answer?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Whoa.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
How about this one from level 9000 Yadru Dru Dru Davenport.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Thank you, Drew.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
It's from Yadru answers user Rhonda.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Ah, fuck.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
There's a banner ad for Destiny 2 at the top and it's just making me think about the fact that I'm here doing this instead of.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Have you ever thought about the fact that the logo at the end of the Destiny is the fidget spinner?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Oh, yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
All the time.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
Anybody here by a show of hands had an actual moment where they're like, I know I got tickets to this thing, but.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Okay.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Thank you for your honesty.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I had the moment too.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Rhonda asks.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Help me prank my stepdad.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I love my stepdad.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
He is so cool.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Probably not.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
At the most, a stepdad can be like kind of cool.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Signed Rhonda's stepdad.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I mean.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
I mean.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
But he claims he is, quote, the king of pranks.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
I take it back.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
This is a very fucking cool stepdad.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
He claims he's the king of pranks.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And so me and my mom want to play a prank on him.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
We looked up a few things, but so far nothing seems good enough.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I thought of doing something to his truck.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Smiley face.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
That's fucking.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
That's a.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
That's an escalation right there.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I thought about lining the undercarriage of his truck with C4.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Get it.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
But we live on a farm and anything we can do outside might hurt our horses if they get in it.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And then this might get in the truck.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Let's go.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Come on.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Why today?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Horses.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Why did the horses have to drive our C4 laden truck?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Why did they have to try the trap truck today?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
No.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
No.

13:24.000 --> 13:31.000
Hey, then I'm not proud of that.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Anything you can do outside might hurt our horses if they get in it.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And then there's the emoticon of like the colon slash.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
So it's like my killer horses.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
The only thing that makes I know you need to finish the question.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
But the only thing that makes sense to me is that this question asker is envisioning one of those like big holes with vines.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Right.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Like that's a trap.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Yeah, they're making a stepdad trap outside the porch.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
What?

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
What trap are you setting that you're worried about hurting horses but not your step?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, sure.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Stepdads are typically much more fragile than a horse.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
That's not true.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Except on ABC's new comedy.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
My stepdad's a horse.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Right on after and before Young Sheldon.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
It's all we got.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
It's all we got folks.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Young Sheldon and horse stepdads.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
We got 30 minutes of Sheldon and then 23 hours and 30 minutes of horse torture.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Let me finish the question.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Any suggestions for awesome pranks I can do inside?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Me and my mom.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Thank you.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Big laughy face emoticon.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Laugh on.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Can I say my favorite part of this question?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
There's so much to love about this question.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
How do you pick a favorite?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
My favorite part of this question is but nothing's good enough.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Nothing's good enough for my stepdad.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
The moments where they look at him like, oh that's mmm, not for the king of pranks.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
No.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
The problem, I would never call myself the king of pranks because that's painting a huge...

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
You wouldn't?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
What?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
No, it's painting a huge target under your back.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
If you say I'm the king of pranks, you're basically begging to get pranked.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
That's how you end up in one of those YouTube videos where they like pretend to throw your

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
son off like a fucking ledge.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Hilarious.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
And I'm at home like, what the fuck is wrong with...

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I made you think our kid died.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
What the fuck guys?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
No!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Rain it in.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
A pie in the face.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
A bucket of water on the door.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Rain it in?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Horses.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You can't just say a horse.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
That was nothing.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
You had to say insert joke here.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Joke to be named later.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
Travis, that was a bad bit because you put those in horse mouths.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
Can you...

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
How do you like them apples?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
No, no, no, no, no.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
Oats snap.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
That was way worse than mine.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
Oats snap was better than how you like them apples because there's so many creatures that

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
enjoy an apple.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
All right.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Can we get back to the main question?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
What?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
I'm not even doing them now.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
I love your unbridled enthusiasm.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
That's pretty good though.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
That's pretty good.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
I just got in the latest Gallup poll.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
This sucks.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
When Travis does this, by the way, that's what he does to his baby.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
So he thinks all y'all's babies.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Okay.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
I have an idea for a good prank that doesn't...

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
It's not going to hurt your horses.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Thank you.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Stepdad wakes up, throws off the sheets, what's wet in my bed?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
It's a severed horse head like in Godfather.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Wait, but Griffin, you said...

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
But it's not one of your horses, so it's all...

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Okay.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
So everything's okay.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Everybody wins.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Everybody wins.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
It wasn't...

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
He'll freak out and then he'll look at the face of the horse and be like, oh, it's not

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
one of my horses.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
No harm, no foul.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Good one, Rhonda.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Good one, Rhonda.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
You got me.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
You got me good.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Okay, it's time for another question.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I was trying to...

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
There's just so few pranks that won't kill a horse.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah.

17:15.000 --> 17:24.000
One time on April Fools, I did the bucket of water on the doorframe thing, but we didn't

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
have a bucket.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
And so I used a foot bath and I filled that motherfucker up.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
And then dad walked into the bathroom and it fell on him.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
And it was probably a good 25 pounds of water.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
It didn't turn over, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
It didn't turn over.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
It just kind of...

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
Pretty good prank though.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
We also...

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Got you, dad.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
One of our pranks was we shut off the main power switch to our whole house.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
So it turned off all the alarm clocks in our house.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Got you.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
You got fired.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
How about a question?

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
I work in a small building that is part of a larger facility.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
There are usually only six to eight people that work in that building.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Often, I'm the only one that uses the women's restroom.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Every day, the custodian comes and cleans the restrooms.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
And every day, he replaces the partially used up roll of toilet paper on the holder in

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
the women's room with a different partially used up roll.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
I don't know what happens in the men's room.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
The answer, car stuff.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
I've always got an engine block in there that I'm working on, tinkering.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Just car stuff.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I thought for a second you said car talk.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Car talk.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
That's where they recorded it.

18:54.000 --> 19:01.000
I know it's a different role because the pattern or texture of the paper is different each day.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
We're going to circle back.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
I don't think we've ever finished up a roll in the 10 years I've been in this building.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
The custodian rarely speaks, so I can't ask what is going on.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Wait, wait, wait.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Time out.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Can you raise your hand real quick if you're here?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Wait.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Can you raise it?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Stand up then.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I can't quite see you.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Are you way in the back?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Wait, so are you over here?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Thank you.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Just a little bit of balcony.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Are you standing up?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Oh, so you're right there.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
Okay.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Come on.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
I'm giving you a look.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
Are you waiting for him to broach the subject?

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Let me explain my toilet weirdness.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
You can turn the house lights out now.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Thank you.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
This is overwhelming.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
There's too many people.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Is there more to the question?

20:01.000 --> 20:07.000
Custodian rarely speaks, so I can't ask what is going on.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Why is this happening?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
That's from Perplexed Paper Partaker.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
That's such a nice button to that question.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
It has nothing to do with the rest of the question.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Why is it happening?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Well, sometimes life finds a way.

20:19.000 --> 20:27.000
Sometimes when God closes a door, he introduces a bathroom mystery.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
So here's the main thing I want to talk about.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
The first issue that I have with this question, besides the fact that you definitely can't talk to people that don't talk a lot, right?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
We're good on that.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
That's actually the people you should talk to.

20:41.000 --> 20:47.000
They have the best stories, like why they're introducing bathroom mysteries into your life on a daily basis.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
The people that talk a lot give you everything.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
The people who don't talk?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Justin is taking the mic out of his hand.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
I just came up with this saying still waters run deep when you think about that.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
No, here's the problem I have with it.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
What are you doing?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Where are you going?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I'm just feeling the stage.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Okay, so here's my issue.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Stop, stop, stop.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
This is not a big bit.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I just wanted to stand up for it.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
Okay, so you say the toilet paper has different patterns.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Act it out, act it out.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Every day.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Thank you, Travis.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
It has different patterns every day.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
That's not how toilet paper works.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
I've never maintained a big facility, but I don't think toilet paper exchange begins with, ah, yes, let's see.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
The 1978 Charmin.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
They made quintuple ply that year.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I think also it comes in a big fucking pack.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
There's like 30 of them.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
You work in a building.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't understand.

21:42.000 --> 21:52.000
This custodian is Robin Hood-ing it, stealing from the sit-go to give to the, your office.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
Like the first day he showed up, they were like, well, that's everything.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
And, well, there's supposed to be a page in the back here about how to order more toilet paper.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Well, you know what?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
And he didn't.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
He just didn't.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I think, okay, so first of all, you're the only person who uses this bathroom.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
First of all, well done.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
That's the dream.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Never quit.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
You're the only human being who's used that bathroom in 10 years.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's legally yours.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
It's yours.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
You could definitely live there.

22:24.000 --> 22:33.000
Literal squatters rights.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
If you're the only person that uses that bathroom, wouldn't it be kind of weird if a person came in every day?

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
And could look at how much toilet paper you had, you and you alone had used that day?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Hmm. Rough day.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Oh no.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Like that.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Okay.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
But think about this for a second.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Really?

22:51.000 --> 22:59.000
If they were switching it out when the role was exhausted, they would have fucking a decade's worth of data about how much you shit.

22:59.000 --> 23:08.000
Fucking custodian Nate Silver just like, oh, went through one in four days. What's going on?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yikes.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Back off on the brunes.

23:11.000 --> 23:21.000
My fucking toilet life is such garbo that it took me a second to think about what would be a normal amount of time to go through a whole roll of toilet paper.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
And when I say normal, I mean people normal.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
Not Griffin or me.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
How about another Yahoo?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Yeah.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Okay, but can I say actually, please ask him and email us.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Please just ask.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
If it's the one about him not wanting to know how much you use the potty, I will just be eternally delighted.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
What if he's so excited and he's just been building a conversation starter for 10 years like, they'll notice.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
They have to notice now.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Certainly it's been 10 years they've noticed.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
He's been building like a TP fort.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Oh, thank you for asking.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Come in.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Look at this stuff.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Isn't it neat?

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Hold on.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
No, that sucks.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
It's my Pato Prato.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
It sucks that I have personified this custodian as a toilet paper collector.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
That's no good.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Actually, as a toilet mermaid is what you drive.

24:18.000 --> 24:27.000
It's okay, Griffin, he'll never hear it because he doesn't talk much.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
How about another Yahoo?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah, this one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Seth, you're here, right?

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Yeah.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
In that sort of zone, in that region.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Thank you, Seth.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
You are killing it.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Blurry301 who asks, so in the emoji-

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Wait, why did someone clap?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Are you Blurry301?

24:54.000 --> 25:07.000
So, in the emoji movie, can other emojis have sex and have kids?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Got to do this one.

25:09.000 --> 25:18.000
Y'all answer this.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah, they sure can.

25:22.000 --> 25:34.000
Because two meh emojis had a son and they probably fucked.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Real quick, I just Googled the emoji movie Dreamworks just to make sure we weren't burning

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
the Trolls 2 bridge.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
It was just made by Steven's movies.

25:45.000 --> 25:53.000
By that logic, Justin, every character in every animated movie was the result of sex.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
No, please don't link them.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Fucking Lightning McQueen, you seem like, oh yeah, driving real fast.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Someone had to do it to make him, probably.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
No, wait, no, no, no, no, no.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Did you see Lightning McQueen's parents?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I've never seen a car, but I assume no.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Really, it's really good.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Wait, does anybody know?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
No, you don't see Lightning McQueen's parents.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Wait, Travis, I'm trying to IMDB this.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
No, we heard a firm no.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Somebody was very confident.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
No!

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
So that's what I'm saying.

26:24.000 --> 26:31.000
If you don't see their parents, they could just be a creation of God from mud and ribs.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
And then he breathed life into them.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Car God.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Lightning McQueen cannot have ribs.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
What?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
This car cannot have ribs and bones.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Griffin, hold on.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
Have you ever built a car?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I have not.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
So for all you know.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Why are these movies so chicken shit?

26:53.000 --> 27:01.000
Show me the inside out emotions parents making love before I meet the characters.

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
And there'd be a little horny emotion and they'd be like, yeah.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
We have talked a lot about horniness.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
We're in the horny capital of America, baby.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
The Washington Monument is basically a boner.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Finally, someone makes that observation.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
So here's the thing.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
You saw his parents and they were both men emojis.

27:27.000 --> 27:35.000
And then he was a man emoji also, which also makes you think that the emojis can die.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
Which seems weird too.

27:39.000 --> 27:46.000
Because if they can fuck, they can die too.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
So what I'm saying is that we all try hard enough.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
We can kill the characters in the emoji movie apparently.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Because we know they're mortal because they fuck.

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
When Justin, when you do you think is emoji death when you use it?

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
What do you mean?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Like in the movie, is it like they're all afraid of getting tapped?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
They're all afraid of.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Well, that's sex.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
They're all afraid of being used.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Well, they probably covered this in the film.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Travis, I don't want to recount the plot of the emoji.

28:18.000 --> 28:25.000
My question is when you were watching the emoji movie and there was Patrick Stewart and he was a little turd.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
And everybody else in the theater was delighted.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
Were you looking thinking that Patrick Stewart turd is going to die one day?

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
That Patrick Stewart turd was the result of sex and is also going to die one day.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
His son's in the movie and he's voiced by Patrick Stewart, which is sad also.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
Just because Patrick Stewart shouldn't be doing things like that.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
He knows better twice.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
He voices his own son?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
No, I'm sorry.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
I phrased that poorly.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
That would be really cool, though.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
You're right.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
It would be a great movie.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
It would have been the one fine artistic choice they had made.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Well, why would they need to give the, it's still the shit emoji.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Why does it need a better voice?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Like it should be the same voice.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Wait, that would indicate that they are reproducing.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Like if they don't have discrete genetic material.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
All these characters are fucking Justin.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
We've covered it.

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
There's a movie called Storks, which I watched some of because it was on and Henry was watching it.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
And then I kind of watched it a little bit more.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
He walked in and Henry was like, check it out, dads.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
I finally figured it out.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It's birds or whatever.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
In that one, they get letters.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
They're like, I want a baby.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And they put it in a machine and then a baby comes out.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I am now recounting the plot of Storks.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
My life is taking a strange turn.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
And I saw that and I thought, bullshit.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
There's some kids watching this and they're like, ha ha, you used to be a letter.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
And it's like, nuh uh.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Their parents fucked.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
You need to learn about this stuff someday.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
It could be both.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
This live show is taking a really fucking weird turn.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
Okay, but in the plot of Boss Baby.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Be cool, everyone.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Be cool, everybody.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
They divide babies into babies that would be good at business in heaven.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Sorry, it's in heaven.

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
They divide babies that would be good at business and babies that deserve families.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
My applause, if you've seen this fucking movie, please cheer if I'm telling the truth.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Thank you.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
This is some fucked up The Giver shit.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah, babies that are good at business and babies that deserve families.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Which on a certain level, I get it.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
Because to be fair, people who are good at business, they don't deserve families.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Do you ever see a baby doing business and also with a family

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
and you just think, how do they do it?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
They have it all.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
They have it all.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
God, we just talked about the emoji movie for 10 minutes.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
No.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Boop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Whoa.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
It's coming in hot.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Hold on, there's a hot one coming in.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
It's coming in hot direct to me where I took a screenshot.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Hold on.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Boop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Looking at Justin's pictures.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
No, you're looking at this picture.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
It's a haunted doll watch.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
This has come in hot.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Go back.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
What?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Sorry.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
You just want to enjoy it one more time.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
This is not good audio.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So we'll just be quick about this part.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
This is the haunted doll we're talking about today.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
It is Nativius.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Okay.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Nice non-haunted name to start out with.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Nativius?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Nativius.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
So this is from a paranormal investigation group that photographs private homes.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Hopefully with consent.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Come on in.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Police.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Photograph all my stuff.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Stranger.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
Just let me know if anything's weird or whatever.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
So here's the Nativius story.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Spiritual possession.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
Every Christmas I love going to church and hearing the Nativius story.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Of the spooky baby Jesus.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Woo!

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
So Nativius' original whereabouts are a mystery to Carla.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
Now I've heard some pretty good opening lines to novels before.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
That's a very good opener.

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
All she knows is that one day she came home from work and there in her fenced-in backyard was this doll.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Well that sucks.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Nice.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
No, cool.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Free doll.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Free ghost.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Also I love that there could be no other explanation.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Yeah, that's it.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Yeah, somebody threw it over your fucking fence.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
I borrowed that one.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Because it was haunted.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
She was lying on the grass under the birdbath.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
Carla was baffled as to how this doll even got into her locked eight-foot tall fence.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
So suck an egg.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
Nobody can throw a doll eight feet.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
It was a bird.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Totes.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
It was Aaron Rodgers.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Green Bay Packers Quarter.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I was the only one.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I gotta get rid of this fucking doll.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
She checked with all her neighbors but no one knew anything about the doll.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Now fucking hold the phone.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
You're telling me that somewhere on earth someone got to have the delight of,

33:05.000 --> 33:11.000
Hello, my name is Carla.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
Did you drop this doll?

33:14.000 --> 33:22.000
I believe it has paranormal proximity.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
She was really intrigued with this doll.

33:25.000 --> 33:32.000
She wasn't a collector of such items, but if you're a collector of haunted items and you find another haunted item,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I do not trust you very much.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
Who isn't a collector of them and sees a doll and goes, ghost doll?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Yeah, cool ghost doll.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
I've never had experience with this before, but why wouldn't I assume?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
She felt this strong pull of energy almost freezing her in place for a moment.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Carla immediately knew this was something bigger than she had ever experienced.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Justin, can I say my favorite word in that whole thing?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Ejaculation.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
No.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Almost?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Almost.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Almost freezing her in place, but it didn't.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
But it didn't.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
But I could have sworn for a second, I almost could have been frozen.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Freezing was on the table.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It was an option I could have taken.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
Carla called her friends at night and told them what she found.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Most of her friends laughed off the whole spooky doll thing.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
But Carla's one friend Mia said, I'll be over tomorrow and we'll try to speak with her.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
This is the fucking mumble core of haunted doll stories.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
I do like, and maybe this is just miswording, but Carla's one friend Mia.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Yeah, Carla's one friend Mia.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
One real friend.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
One real friend.

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
If you can't like Carla at her worst, you don't deserve her when she calls you to say,

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
hey, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw a doll over my eight foot fence,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
will you come check this shit out with me?

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
I love this running theme of, can you imagine if you're one of her other friends who gets

34:52.000 --> 35:00.000
the call like, hey, this is going to seem random, but I've got a haunted doll.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
What?

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
I only hear from you when you have haunted dolls.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
You never ask about Jeffrey.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
So Carla heard a loud noise.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
She found nothing out of place.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
That's not a story.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
That's a bad story, yes.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
That's not a story really.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
I thought something happened, but it didn't anyway.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
I swear to God, the next evening Carla's friend Mia came over.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
This is the only haunted doll story I've ever read that had fucking time lapses.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
So anyway, nothing happened for a little bit.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
That has a B plot.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
And also Mia was going through some shit.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
And then Mia's boyfriend was like, the baby's not mine.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Carla had already told her what happened last night.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Mia was ready to question this doll.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
She had to really psych herself up.

35:48.000 --> 35:56.000
They set up an old, small VHS video recorder for reasons that are just beyond me.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Because it's 1988.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
They turned the lights off and lit a bunch of candles.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
They sat at the kitchen table with the doll in the middle of the table.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
They began to ask all sorts of questions, but nothing was happening.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I wish there was a period there and that was the end of the listing.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
So anyway, give me $40 for this.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
All of a sudden, Mia jumped out of her chair and yelled, ouch.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Mia pulled her shirt away from her shoulder.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
And there on her shoulder blade was three fresh scratch markings that made the skin red and raised.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
All right, listen.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
We were all making a lot of jokes, but then this shit got real.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Did she die?

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
What if the next sentence was, and then my friend, my only friend Mia did die.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
Well, to be fair, this is all written in second person.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
And then Carla's friend Mia died.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Hang in there. It's about to take a quick turn.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
We heard, okay, we started to watch the video the women had made.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
So this is like switched person now.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
What the fuck is fourth person?

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
It was two hours and 52 minutes long.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Okay.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Hold on.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
It was directed by Peter Jackson.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
You're watching this video with your friends.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
At what point in the two hours and 52 minutes where you're like, we should do something else.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Can we please do anything else?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Whose idea was this?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Whose idea was this?

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
So at some point in the video, a little over an hour, whoosh.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
You made it that far.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Oofa doofa.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
We heard a woman's voice.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
It was raspy with a touch of Southern accent in it.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Nice.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Well, hey, y'all.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
Like the lady who used to narrate Great Chefs of the East.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
What?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Did she say that?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
What?

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
No, that was me editorializing.

37:35.000 --> 37:42.000
When they asked her name to these voices or whatever, the word Navidius was spoken and

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
the woman started using her name, Navidius, to ask questions and then they received more

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
responses.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
We heard the year 1892 spoken when they asked what year she was born.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
She would never give a year to the death, but she did use the word noose when asked

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
how she died.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Damn.

37:57.000 --> 38:03.000
Can I just say, how do you say the name was Navidius and like late 1800s is where you

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
think Navidius came from.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Navidius is absolutely, this is the end of the listing.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
There's a lot more.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I'm giving you the abridged.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Fuck.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Navidius is absolutely not a doll for the beginner.

38:16.000 --> 38:23.000
Although we do not feel as though Navidius is harmful, we do feel that she has negative

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
energy about her and this should be taken into serious consideration before bidding

38:27.000 --> 38:34.000
on her doll stand not included.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
So that's your haunted doll watch.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
How can you say?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I got a Samsung 55 inch.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
I'm trying to upgrade, get the 4k television.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
Also, it scratched my friend real bad on the shoulder.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
No negative energy though.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
It scratched the fuck out of my friend, but do get this TV.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
It's fucked up one way or the other because you're either saying it scratched my friend,

39:00.000 --> 39:06.000
but we haven't got any proof or we haven't got any proof, but I think she's terrible.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Like she hasn't done anything.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
It's cool.

39:09.000 --> 39:24.000
It's fine.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Hi folks, Travis here.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
I sure hope you're enjoying this live show episode.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
We had so much fun recording it.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
You may find yourself wondering why are we putting up the DC episode when we recorded

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
the New York show first?

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
We're saving that just for a little bit.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
It will go up.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
We didn't lose it.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
There were no problems with the audio or anything like that.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
But you're going to get the DC show first.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
And if you came out to the shows or even if you weren't able to make it, just want to

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
say Brooklyn, DC and Boston were all so amazing.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Thank you all so much for having us and coming out and supporting the show.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Looking forward to all our future tours.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
But I do want to take a second here to tell you about some of our sponsors this week.

40:10.000 --> 40:17.000
First, we're sponsored by my brother, my brother and me, favorite and friend, NatureBox.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
I took NatureBox with me both on my vacation and on my tour.

40:21.000 --> 40:27.000
I enjoyed those snacks wherever I went because right now NatureBox has over a hundred snacks

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
that taste good and are actually better for you.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
And they're not lying.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
These snacks are delicious.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
No matter what kind of snack you like, if you like salty, they got salty.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
If you like sweet, they got sweet.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
And in fact, you can actually get additional things too for just a little bit of an extra

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
charge.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
I got some beef jerky, some meat protein bars that were really good.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
I just had these mini crispy snickerdoodles that were amazing.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
And of course, my favorite, the Asiago cheese crisps.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
and Caprese salad, soy glazed pork and rice cakes with bok choy and marinated green beans.

This message is for Darla and Stefan and it's from Dory Jo.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
Dear Darla and Stefan, happy anniversary.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
I couldn't think of a better way to appreciate you both than to have it said by our favorite

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
three wise men.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Well, hopefully I'm the favorite because it's just me.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
Thank you for introducing me to this fountain of truth, also known as MBMB.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Fountain of truth?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
That's really good.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Very clever.

Congratulations on four years of successfully married life.

Here's to many more.

Your favorite sister, Dory Jo.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
Hey, congratulations to you Dory Jo on being a great sister.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000

This is for Evan and it's from your middle sister Emma and your sweet baby brother Will.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Happy birthday, Ev.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
We love you so much.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
We wanted the Mackle boys, well, once again, just me, to acknowledge your birthday.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
After all, it's your fault.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
We love them so much.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
I hope you're enjoying it and I hope you continue to.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Hi there.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
I'm comedian and movie buff Ricky Carmona and I'm excited to tell you about a new show

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I'm doing called Who Shot Ya?

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
Join me, LA Weekly film critic April Wolf.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
I'm going to call Star Wars when it comes out the Clint Howard project.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
Film reviews editor for The Wrap, Alonzo Duraly.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
Everything Charlize Theron knows about killing somebody with a high heeled shoe she learned

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
from single white female.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
And our dope ass friends each week.

45:02.000 --> 45:10.000
I think we need to end this pernicious belief in our society that there is anything remotely

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
f***able about rich dudes who are emotionally unbearable.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
So if you're tired of wack opinions and you're looking for a smart, funny film discussion

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
show, check out Who Shot Ya, son.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
That's what we do.

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
And you can find us at MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
What do you want to do?

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Yeah, it's audience questions.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Let's do some audience questions.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Let's do some audience questions.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Let's do a lot.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
All right.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
We'll call.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
House lights.

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
We will call on some folks if we can get some house lights so we can see any of them.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
I see like four hands, but.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
All right.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Let's start on the right side.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I see somebody holding a hat up.

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
Person who's holding a hat up because of your creative flagging technique.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Can we get a little bit more house?

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
A little bit less us.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
It's extremely us.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Yeah.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Intimate.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
There's wow.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
There's just not a good way for you to do this.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Is there?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
I've got I've got fingerprints.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
I was.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
I was.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Yeah.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
You walking around.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Keep coming around.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
You're doing great.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
I've got baby fingerprints.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
You want to do it?

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Let's do.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
All right.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
We'll do you first and then we'll do you.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Yeah.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Yeah.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Hi.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Hi.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Hello.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Hi.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
My name is Marco.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Hi, Marco.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
You can angle the mic down if you want.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Yeah.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Thank you.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Hi, Marco.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
How's it being us?

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
So I work at a local ACE Hardware.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Cool.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
And it's great.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
It's locally owned.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
So I get to meet a lot of people.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
You know, it's great.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
That's great.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Do you have a section?

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Is there like a certain area.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah, I mix paint.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Nice.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
That's sounds so fun.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Yeah, it is.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
It is a lot of fun, but.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
Do people ever just say like, surprise me?

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
I feel like when they're surprised, it's probably bad for them.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.380
Can I ask you a question that you'll probably have like a dope answer for?

46:58.380 --> 47:04.820

the music off and we'll start turning off lights uh-huh but I was wondering is

48:55.980 --> 48:59.660

48:59.660 --> 49:14.380

49:14.380 --> 49:25.020

like unaware of the fact that it was midnight at the end of this year and a

51:04.220 --> 51:10.780
new one was kicking off and this is how she was ringing it in and I had a moment

51:10.780 --> 51:19.100
where I thought which one of us sucks more I was judging her and I was wearing

51:19.100 --> 51:25.180

be meeting my mom this is the most nice they're not you're not meeting each

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:58.420
other okay okay do you have you charted the exact geographic midpoint between

town and the desktop globe where's the exit wound is it about okay make the

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.260

Casey what happened what happened last year I was moving so I was getting rid

of like all the garbage that I had like collected over the years and like my dad

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:18.340
like worked at like worked at like grocery stores his entire life and so

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:22.980
he would come home and just like throw display shit at me and be like this is a

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:31.420
present and I'm like okay so he gave me like a Lego Keebler elf at one point and

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:36.220
the only place that it fit was like at the top of my like big dresser and it

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:40.620
stared at me as I slept as a child and I hated it for the all my life so I am I

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:45.020
want you to know yeah this is a fucking good story Casey way better than the

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.140
haunted doll that Justin brought to the table it was it was definitely haunted

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.740
um so I decided to get rid of it last year and I put it on Craigslist for like

01:13:54.740 --> 01:14:00.980
five bucks and nobody like responded to it for days and make sense yeah yeah

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:05.220
realize you didn't want it for many years and you're like you know someone

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:11.580

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.900
like text messages non-stop where's this Keebler elf where's this Keebler elf

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:19.780
where's this Keebler elf and I'm like I can like I already I already moved at
