00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:44.320
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say, hey I wanna.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.120
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother made an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.640
And I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:54.640 --> 01:02.640
Now, folks, I'm gonna try to keep this brief, but the reviews are in, Captain Underpants is a hit.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.200
Hey guys, hey guys, boxers or briefs is my question.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.480
Boxer office smash, is that anything?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.760
It's something, it's something.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.080
Hey.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.840
Listen, it's a watch.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.960
What's going on under those pants?

01:18.960 --> 01:22.640
His penis never comes out, the whole movie, don't even worry about it.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.720
Oh, I had to Google that to make sure before I took all my kids to it.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.840
Travis, let me ask you a question.

01:34.560 --> 01:41.520
When you were making your fantasy cast list on IMDB for Captain Underpants,

01:41.520 --> 01:46.400
who did you envision, who would be your dream get for Professor Poopypants?

01:46.400 --> 01:46.880
Myself.

01:46.880 --> 01:55.360
Myself, close, Nick Kroll takes on the notoriously dirty drawers as Professor Poopypants.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.080
Kevin Hart is back as George Beard, Thomas Middleditch.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.080
In a reprise role, it's the first one of the Captain Underpants movies,

02:04.080 --> 02:08.640
but it's the second time Kevin Hart has played a Captain Underpants role in a film.

02:09.920 --> 02:14.720
Justin, who plays Professor Poopypants' sidekick, Sid Mark?

02:14.720 --> 02:17.280
That's Mark Paul Gosler.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.240
Weird.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.040
With a dramatic turn.

02:21.040 --> 02:26.320
Captain Underpants is about two children who hypnotize a bad man

02:26.320 --> 02:29.600
into thinking he's a superhero who wears his underpants everywhere.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.520
Can I say this?

02:31.520 --> 02:35.840
Because the problem is he didn't have a living will,

02:35.840 --> 02:39.760
and I want to get out in front of this now on this podcast.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.560
If you're a kid, don't fucking turn me into Captain Underpants.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.200
Don't do it.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.000
If I cross you.

02:46.000 --> 02:46.240
Stop it.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.200
Don't do it.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.280
If you, but listen, if they do.

02:50.480 --> 02:54.640
This is so hard to say because nobody wants to think this way.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.440
You know, you want to think everything's going to be fine forever,

02:57.440 --> 03:03.200
but if you see me on the street wearing a cape and my underpants

03:03.200 --> 03:06.640
and I've been hypnotized by children, and please confirm,

03:06.640 --> 03:12.000
I may just be at some sort of parade, but if I have been hypnotized by children,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.760
I need you, I need you to bring me down.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.240
All right?

03:16.240 --> 03:16.800
Oh, shit.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.120
You're saying we have legal, and this podcast counts,

03:21.120 --> 03:24.160
like we can, we can get this episode notarized or whatever,

03:24.160 --> 03:27.920
but you're saying if children hypnotize you, Justin,

03:27.920 --> 03:30.880
into becoming an underwear crime fighter,

03:31.840 --> 03:37.200
Travis and I, in order to sort of save your, your dignity,

03:37.200 --> 03:43.920
your, your legacy, sort of your whole brand, we can legally kill you.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.360
Not just can legally kill me.

03:47.360 --> 03:47.680
Must.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.760
You do not have the legal right to kill me.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.920
You have the moral obligation.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.360
And that's, that'll hold up in court.

03:53.360 --> 03:59.200
So just to, just to clarify, we could be talking about Wonder Woman,

03:59.200 --> 04:03.040
a movie that I am legitimately very excited to see,

04:03.040 --> 04:08.880
and as soon as I figure out how to do so, while also having a seven-month-old child,

04:08.880 --> 04:09.360
I will be doing so.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.800
Stack them up and, to stack the two of you up in a trench coat and go in.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.440
Okay, so we could be talking about that, but instead,

04:16.240 --> 04:22.880
we are talking about morally being obligated to euthanize our brother,

04:22.880 --> 04:25.280
in the event that he's in underpants.

04:25.280 --> 04:31.760
Travis, you've used the term euthanize as if Justin will just lay down and accept his fate.

04:31.760 --> 04:38.480
Oh, listen, no, you're gonna have to, euthanothin', you're gonna have to kill me.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.040
And listen, I'm gonna be a superhero, okay?

04:41.040 --> 04:41.920
It's gonna be tough.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.120
I will see Captain Underpants before I see Wonder Woman.

04:47.120 --> 04:47.760
Confront that.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.360
A film I would like to see, and I'm confronting it here with you.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.560
Now, I will say this.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.640
The tomatometers looking good, 86%.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.000
Really?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's a zesty ragu.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.360
I'm gonna enjoy this particular marinara.

05:01.360 --> 05:06.320
For sure, but it is not going to star America's favorite Amazon.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.040
I'll be catching that on DVD.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.080
Wonder Woman, get at me, I will check you in September.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.000
Thank you for all you've done for our nation.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.560
Justin, J-Bones, can you make me a promise?

05:17.280 --> 05:18.400
G-money, hit it.

05:18.400 --> 05:23.280
When you do fall into our trap after you have been hypnotized by the children

05:23.280 --> 05:28.800
into becoming the Underwear Man, and we catch you in the trap, and we do kill you,

05:28.800 --> 05:33.200
can you promise me that there will not be one last moment of lucidity there at the end

05:33.200 --> 05:37.040
where you thank us before dying, and you're your regular Justin in that moment?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.320
Because I'm thinking about it, Justin.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.760
That's gonna be too hard for me to handle.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.840
I've just killed my underwear superhero brother.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.880
I don't need him turning back into Justin there at the end like,

05:44.880 --> 05:46.800
you've set me free, you know what I mean?

05:46.800 --> 05:50.640
Like, if you do have that moment of lucidity, I need you to keep pretending

05:50.640 --> 05:54.320
that you're the Underwear Man, just so I don't have to deal with those demons.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.920
What if my voice sounds different?

05:55.920 --> 05:56.720
You'll know what's up.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.320
Just do your best.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.120
I'm sorry, Griffin.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.000
I have to say, Justin, don't make eye contact with Griffin in that moment,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.680
but do make eye contact with me because I want to know that I freed you

06:05.680 --> 06:07.200
and you also appreciate it.

06:07.200 --> 06:13.440
I need to know that you appreciate how hard it was for me to kill you in your final moments.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.120
Let me get another one in here.

06:15.760 --> 06:21.200
The children have just done the spell to you, and the transformation has begun.

06:21.200 --> 06:26.960
At what point in the transformation can Travis and I sort of go safety off, free fire?

06:26.960 --> 06:31.120
Is it like a Walking Dead situation where if you are bitten, you're done?

06:31.120 --> 06:33.200
You're meat already, and so we should just...

06:33.200 --> 06:36.960
Or do you think you might be able to fight off the kid's spell?

06:38.000 --> 06:44.800
Well, I mean, it's further complicated by the fact that if they're just fucking with me,

06:45.200 --> 06:46.640
go ahead and take the shot.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.000
If you've got the shot, take the shot, okay?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.080
Okay. If the kids are fucking with me.

06:52.080 --> 07:01.520
If there is an evil that I have to confront and subdue, let me just do it, okay?

07:01.520 --> 07:03.920
I'll do the evil. I'll fight the evil.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.480
But then, the moment that the evils...

07:06.480 --> 07:08.240
Take the shot, okay?

07:08.240 --> 07:09.280
I need you to promise.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.680
I promise I'll kill you in your underwear.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.240
I will hire Bradley Cooper to kill you in your underwear.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.840
Yeah, he'll help out, definitely.

07:15.840 --> 07:20.480
I would like a little Bradley Cooper buffer between me and my brother.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.080
And you know what?

07:22.080 --> 07:23.040
I think of...

07:23.040 --> 07:25.280
Listen, I don't know Bradley that well.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.280
We've only chatted online a couple times,

07:27.280 --> 07:31.920
but I'm pretty sure he's probably been asked to do this kind of thing before.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.360
No, dude's yoked.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.280
He could fucking kill, definitely.

07:35.280 --> 07:35.920
Yeah.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.240
Yeah.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.920
Hey, great news, guys.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.760
I googled Mark Paul Gosselaar.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.000
His Twitter account is just mpg.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.360
Well done.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.720
Wow, early adopter.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.000
Great get in there.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.800
Can we do advice?

07:49.440 --> 07:50.000
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.160
Justin, do question number four.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.360
I was going to save it.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.440
I wasn't sure about it, but I'm feeling it.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.800
Jump right into it.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.880
How do you throw away empty alcohol bottles and cans and shit

08:02.880 --> 08:05.680
if you're underage and don't want to get caught?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.120
I'm V drunk.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.840
Please tell me how to throw away my stuff.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.680
Peace, Gmail.

08:11.680 --> 08:17.440
I think legally, we've covered ourselves so far.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.120
We're allowed to legally murder Justin

08:19.120 --> 08:21.600
if he gets hypnotized and becoming an underwear man.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.120
And now legally, we also have to say,

08:24.000 --> 08:29.760
it's not cool to do this.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.120
Okay, now that we've said that.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.840
Even if we maybe act like you're cool

08:35.840 --> 08:40.000
or say that it's cool pretty directly in the next few minutes,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.480
it's that you should know how we really feel.

08:44.480 --> 08:44.960
Yeah.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.720
And it's just not cool.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.680
What follows is-

08:47.680 --> 08:48.480
Okay.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.520
What follows is-

08:49.520 --> 08:52.800
It's fair use parody public domain creative comments.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.400
Yeah, this is what we like to call jokes.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.200
This is so cool.

08:59.200 --> 08:59.520
Yeah.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.200
Because you get it.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.320
I like that.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.360
I do worry.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.280
Let me worry about this for a second.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.320
If you're an underage teen and you're drinking

09:10.320 --> 09:11.520
and you're very drunk

09:12.560 --> 09:15.600
and then you're emailing your favorite advice podcast,

09:15.600 --> 09:18.640
I assume, are you drinking alone?

09:19.280 --> 09:22.720
Because that seems to me not great.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.920
Not ideal, not ideal.

09:23.920 --> 09:24.960
Not actually cool.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.760
Here's my question about this.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.200
At what point do you think

09:29.200 --> 09:32.000
in this underage teen drinking experience

09:32.000 --> 09:34.720
do you do the slow scope around

09:34.720 --> 09:37.520
and realize how many empty bottles and cans there are

09:37.520 --> 09:39.920
and realize you have not, you're just like,

09:39.920 --> 09:45.600
oh no, you haven't planned some kind of bag scenario

09:45.600 --> 09:46.720
to get these out of the house

09:46.720 --> 09:48.400
and into your neighbor's garbage can?

09:49.040 --> 09:49.360
Yeah.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.640
So the secret is to buy only the alcohol

09:54.640 --> 09:57.680
that you know your dad's drinking,

09:57.680 --> 09:59.200
that old timey,

09:59.200 --> 10:04.400
I think your dad probably drinks like old timey gut rumble

10:04.400 --> 10:06.400
and it's just a dang clogger

10:06.400 --> 10:12.320
and it just hurts the bones and muscles a lot to drink it.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.000
And so you buy that,

10:14.000 --> 10:15.760
you throw it in the regular old garbage can,

10:15.760 --> 10:19.360
your dad's just like must have tied a few on last night.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.160
I don't remember it,

10:20.160 --> 10:25.440
but this dark juice does stuff,

10:25.440 --> 10:26.960
plays tricks on the mind, doesn't it?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.760
What if you took all your empty bottles and cans

10:29.760 --> 10:31.760
and just before somebody got home,

10:32.320 --> 10:35.520
you just kind of like spread them around the dog

10:36.720 --> 10:38.000
and then when people,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.800
when whoever your guardians got home,

10:40.800 --> 10:41.520
they're like, what?

10:41.520 --> 10:44.080
You're like, what, Sparky?

10:44.080 --> 10:46.160
And you acted horrified.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.080
Now listen, this isn't gonna work,

10:48.560 --> 10:51.520
but if you refuse to cave on this,

10:51.520 --> 10:52.960
it's gonna be a story

10:52.960 --> 10:55.360
that you and your guardians will have together forever

10:55.360 --> 10:58.880
that when you are older and you do eventually,

10:58.880 --> 10:59.760
like at 40,

10:59.760 --> 11:03.520
you have a nice like single malt scotch with them

11:03.520 --> 11:04.160
and they can be like,

11:04.160 --> 11:05.680
hey, do you remember that time

11:05.680 --> 11:06.880
that you tried to convince me

11:06.880 --> 11:09.520
that Sparky drank all that bush light?

11:09.520 --> 11:11.600
And you can be like, what are you talking about?

11:11.600 --> 11:13.200
That's exactly what happened.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
You stick to it.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.280
You never change it because they'll catch you.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.080
Dad tried to get me on this at age 30 last week.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.840
He was like, hey, during homecoming,

11:21.840 --> 11:23.200
did you go over to Michael's house

11:23.200 --> 11:26.160
and then you all drank six Smirnoff ices

11:26.160 --> 11:28.000
between the eight of you

11:28.000 --> 11:30.320
and pretended to just get like really fucked up drunk

11:30.320 --> 11:32.880
and then try to sneak the bottles out the next morning?

11:32.880 --> 11:35.680
And I was like, well, I'm 30, so yeah.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.920
And then cops busted in and they arrested me

11:37.920 --> 11:40.080
and took, I'm recording this in jail right now.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.680
I've been in jail for like a week.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.680
I have a question for you, question asker.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.560
Two questions, I guess.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.400
Question one, get out your phone,

11:48.400 --> 11:49.680
go to your list of contacts.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.040
Is the wolf in there at all?

11:51.040 --> 11:54.480
If you can have a fish, is the wolf in there?

11:54.480 --> 11:57.680
Second question, do you just have Harvey Keitel's number?

11:57.680 --> 12:00.080
Because he will, it was basically a documentary.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.040
Oh, I see you have a little underage drinking.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.400
That's great, I love this.

12:05.040 --> 12:08.960
Let me, yeah, go ahead and just clean all these up for you.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.080
I'm your live-in maid, Harvey Keitel.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.960
Do you, you got any Altoids on you?

12:14.960 --> 12:17.200
No, I don't have, why would I have Altoids, Harvey Keitel?

12:17.200 --> 12:20.000
You started underage drinking without any Altoids, huh?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.360
And I'm the asshole.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.120
Schnapps, you expect me to clean up schnapps?

12:25.920 --> 12:26.720
What the fuck?

12:26.720 --> 12:27.920
I don't have to be here.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.880
I think a good drink for teens.

12:32.880 --> 12:33.360
Oh, jeez.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.800
Do you know how teens are crazy about the hard sodas now, right?

12:37.760 --> 12:39.120
Orange hard soda.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.400
Like the difficult sodas?

12:41.680 --> 12:43.760
The hard, the challenging sodas.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.640
Chunky Dr. Pepper.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.960
Like an elderberry soda, that's hard, that's difficult to parse.

12:50.960 --> 12:59.200
So you get some Mike's Latin lemonade, the challenging, challenging teen lemonade.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.040
I'm gonna have not your father's trigonometry root beer.

13:03.840 --> 13:08.800
The thing is about it, the bottle is made of candy.

13:08.800 --> 13:15.760
Okay, it's not, oh God, again, legally, hi, editors, editorial note here.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.040
It's super not, kids, enjoy the rest of the podcast.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.800
No, no, no, I'm not saying it is now.

13:20.800 --> 13:27.040
I'm saying in our new product, the bottle is made of candy.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.960
Like those wax bottles that you like bite the end off of and squeeze

13:30.960 --> 13:34.000
like the teaspoon of juice into your mouth?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.440
That's exactly right.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.120
It's called brew and chew and you drink the drink in it

13:39.680 --> 13:41.600
and then you have to eat the bottles.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.880
There's no evidence.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.240
And here's the thing, are you ready for this?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.840
Because this one's fucking good.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.600
The bottles, what flavor are they?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.200
You guessed it, spearmint.

13:51.120 --> 13:57.360
So you have drunk, you have had a refreshing bottle of brew.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.720
Then you've had a great snack to follow it up.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.080
You're gonna have some regrets about halfway through that bottle

14:04.080 --> 14:06.080
when you gotta realize you're gonna eat the whole bottle.

14:06.080 --> 14:11.200
Spearmint usually doesn't come in meal form, but that's what we're talking about.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.320
You're gonna have to commit.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.480
How bad do you wanna break the rules, huh?

14:14.480 --> 14:17.760
This is a spearmint dish that you're going to be eating.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.440
It's gonna be a lot of spearmint.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.640
You're gonna have to gummy down.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.880
Yeah, but you do that and then you're gonna have fresh breath

14:24.880 --> 14:26.480
and then we will detect the alcohol.

14:26.480 --> 14:26.960
Let me hit you with this.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.080
I can't stress enough, we do not endorse underage drinking,

14:30.080 --> 14:31.280
but that's a great idea.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.560
That's fucking funny and good and cool to do.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.840
I also wanna hit you with guys with this idea that I've been working on.

14:37.840 --> 14:44.320
It is, we take a very, very, very hyper concentrated,

14:44.880 --> 14:47.760
you know, Mike's hard lemonade or whatever.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.400
Very concentrated, a hyper concentrated boons farm

14:52.960 --> 14:57.840
and we somehow saturate a sort of spongy fidget spinner with it.

14:58.480 --> 15:05.280
And then you just sort of like and catch it, catch it, catch it.

15:05.280 --> 15:11.200
And then faded because of all the, again, very, very concentrated boons farm.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.840
It's going to be acidic, which is not to say that it will taste sour,

15:15.840 --> 15:20.800
but that it will have many properties that one usually associates with acid.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.960
But also at the end, what was that noise?

15:22.960 --> 15:23.520
Are you drunk?

15:23.520 --> 15:25.120
No, it's just a fidget spinner.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.920
Let me go a different direction.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.200
What have you said to your kids?

15:29.200 --> 15:32.080
And this might be more of a deterrent than a way to get away with it.

15:32.080 --> 15:37.200
But what have you said to your kids like, hey, I don't care what age you are,

15:37.200 --> 15:39.440
you're allowed to drink as much as you want,

15:39.440 --> 15:48.720
but the only drink you're allowed to have is 50% the pettiest, smokiest scotch

15:48.720 --> 15:51.520
and 50% absinthe, enjoy.

15:52.080 --> 15:57.120
Yeah, that's a bad way to do parenting, I feel like.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.760
But how long do you think that continues to be a problem

15:59.760 --> 16:02.800
before it's just like, sip, nope, you know what, I'm good.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.520
I'm all set.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.400
This is awful.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.560
Well, that's what all alcohol tastes like.

16:06.560 --> 16:06.880
Bye.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.680
Can I hit y'all with Yahoo?

16:10.640 --> 16:12.400
Yeah, it's going underage drink.

16:12.400 --> 16:12.880
Don't underage drink.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.600
This has been a public service announcement.

16:15.600 --> 16:19.120
Yeah, if you bookend it, then people know which part's serious and which part's not.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.160
Kyle Horning sent this in.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.200
Thank you, Kyle Horning.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.560
It's Yahoo Answers User, question mark, which is weird.

16:24.560 --> 16:29.600
Um, usually that means that, like, their profile didn't load or has been erased

16:29.600 --> 16:30.800
and so it just shows a question mark.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.720
They actually made their profile name question mark.

16:34.720 --> 16:41.360
And they said, yeah, they said, going to arrest someone soon.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.680
It's my friend.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.280
They don't know I'm a cop.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.400
What should I do?

16:46.400 --> 16:47.760
I have four hours.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.480
Whoa, whoa.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.760
Fucking heavy stuff.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.320
This is what I imagine The Wire is like, but I've never watched it.

16:56.320 --> 17:00.720
I've only seen one season of The Wire, but this started the second season and I was like,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.320
who the fuck are all these new peop- it's all boats this season?

17:04.320 --> 17:06.880
No, but maybe this is what happens.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.760
My best friend Justin and Travis, they don't know I'm a cop, but in four hours,

17:11.760 --> 17:15.440
they will know when I have them down up against the car or on the ground

17:15.440 --> 17:19.840
with those big nasty silver bracelets going over their wrists.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.720
Griffin, do you think when you have to do that,

17:22.720 --> 17:26.240
when you have to arrest, say, Justin Minsker, a friend of yours,

17:26.240 --> 17:28.800
would you cry while you were doing it?

17:28.800 --> 17:33.760
Or do you think that, like, you would finally feel a weight lifted off of your shoulders?

17:33.760 --> 17:38.880
Do I cry every time I record a podcast or a goof-ass video game video?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.040
No, because it's my fucking job, dog.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.840
Oh, you cry sometimes, though.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.760
I mean, only when the internet says mean things about me,

17:47.760 --> 17:51.120
but not usually, like, just it's my job.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.440
If I arrest Justin Minsker, that's a job.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.320
It's a J-O-B.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.120
Sorry, dude.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.160
Click, click.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.240
I gotta collect in a paycheck.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.600
Griffin, what do you think you said?

18:00.240 --> 18:04.800
Is it, like, a boo-yah moment or is it, like, I can't believe you made me do this moment?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.040
Like, this is on you, not on me.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.240
If you weren't a criminal, I wouldn't have to cop all over you.

18:10.240 --> 18:16.720
I think I'd just robo-cop up and just, like, Miranda that shit and don't even-

18:16.720 --> 18:18.480
Do you have the right to remain my friend?

18:18.480 --> 18:23.600
Yeah, like, I'd be like, you have the right to remain silent, but, like, barbecue Tuesday?

18:23.600 --> 18:24.400
Does that sound good?

18:24.400 --> 18:25.120
Weather looks nice.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.160
We still down?

18:26.160 --> 18:26.720
We still down?

18:26.720 --> 18:28.400
We're gonna play some Coup in the backyard?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.320
I will get your mower back to you, by the way.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.040
I'll get your mower back to, well, to your next of kin,

18:33.040 --> 18:35.600
because you're going to the fucking pokey, dude.

18:37.200 --> 18:37.920
All right, let's go.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.120
I love you.

18:39.120 --> 18:39.680
Come on.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.160
I love you.

18:40.160 --> 18:40.720
Say goodbye.

18:40.720 --> 18:45.120
How often do you say you love you to, like, a friend that you're arresting?

18:45.120 --> 18:48.640
Yeah, you can slip it into the old Miranda and it still counts.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.160
I have to arrest someone soon, but they don't know I'm a cop.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.720
Is this an undercover situa-

18:54.720 --> 18:55.600
It doesn't-

18:55.600 --> 18:58.960
What's tricky is it doesn't sound like an undercover situation.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.880
No, it just sounds like you don't know them that well.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.960
Or they don't know you, because they don't know your vocation.

19:04.960 --> 19:09.120
You know, I bet the hardest part of that scenario is when you're like,

19:09.120 --> 19:12.240
I'm a cop, and they kind of laugh, and you're like, no, really?

19:12.240 --> 19:13.600
And they're like, that's a good one.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.080
And you're like, no, no, really?

19:16.080 --> 19:17.760
I really am a cop.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.920
Like, it's probably hard to get over that hump, you know, of like,

19:21.920 --> 19:23.680
I'm really arresting you.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.720
Very funny, Steve.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.000
Take these cuffs off.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.040
No, no, I really am a cop.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.560
Do you think, yeah, it's the fact that he's a cop for friends in case

19:32.560 --> 19:33.920
they all want to get a little bit nasty?

19:33.920 --> 19:34.800
He doesn't need, like, the-

19:34.800 --> 19:35.680
Yeah, that's-

19:35.680 --> 19:36.640
The judgment.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.600
You're a cop.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.000
How could you steal that?

19:40.000 --> 19:40.240
Yeah.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.640
Wait, you underaged drunk when you were 17, and he starts kind of twitching?

19:44.640 --> 19:45.760
And you're like, what's up, Steve?

19:45.760 --> 19:47.520
Like, no, nothing.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.800
Well, it's like we're going out on a pontoon boat, and I'm not driving the boat,

19:50.800 --> 19:52.720
but am I allowed to drink on the water?

19:52.720 --> 19:53.680
It is in public.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.120
Ah, but Griffin's here.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.320
Maybe I shouldn't.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.200
Just to be safe.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.400
Is there another-

20:03.600 --> 20:04.320
Let me hit this.

20:04.320 --> 20:10.400
Legally, this is a joke.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.360
Got four hours.

20:11.360 --> 20:18.240
I'm gonna phone my buddy up and just say, like, pack a bag, get gone.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.440
I will hunt you for the rest of the night.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.480
Don't get me wrong.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.800
We have got a Jovert-Valjean situation.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.880
This is absolutely what is up.

20:29.680 --> 20:34.160
You've been selling stolen iPod Nanos online.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.360
And I know it's you, dog.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.840
You don't know it's me on the other end of the badge.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.400
You made your username Nano Steve Jenkins.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.200
I know it's you.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.640
I know it's you, Steve Jenkins.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.000
I know it was you the whole time.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.840
But anyway, you have four hours.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.840
And then I will come for you.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.280
Forever.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.440
Forever, I will be a specter of death on your doorstep, Steve.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.080
Why'd you have to sell those Nanos?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.080
Every moment of every day for the rest of your life,

20:58.080 --> 21:00.880
you will feel my hot breath on the back of your neck.

21:00.880 --> 21:01.920
Now get out of town.

21:01.920 --> 21:02.800
I love you, you beautiful bastard.

21:02.800 --> 21:03.600
I love you.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.100
Go.

21:04.100 --> 21:04.600
I love you.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.160
Fly, my beautiful butterfly.

21:07.160 --> 21:13.080
But can I count on you and Steven to be there at the barbecue on Thursday?

21:13.080 --> 21:15.880
And you're still going to walk my dog while I'm in Baltimore, right?

21:16.440 --> 21:16.840
Right?

21:16.840 --> 21:18.200
We're still good on that front.

21:18.200 --> 21:18.600
Excellent.

21:18.600 --> 21:23.240
Me and my buddies are heading out on the east side in three hours.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.320
I want a carpool.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.200
So that's the decision.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.600
Like you can get the extra heads up and like bounce.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.440
But like we're going to Barbarellas.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.640
It's going to be fucking fine.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.120
You're not?

21:32.120 --> 21:32.520
Okay.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.480
No, I understand.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.680
I'll hunt you like the devil.

21:34.680 --> 21:35.180
Bye.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.080
I love you.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.240
Please, if you could leave some clues, that would be great.

21:39.240 --> 21:39.880
Just make it easier on me.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.040
Leave a few clues just to make it fun.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.840
Like you can't come play Coup at my cookout next weekend,

21:44.840 --> 21:46.520
but we could play a different kind of game.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.400
A hunting game.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.080
You fucking Nano pervert.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.120
You Nano freak.

21:52.760 --> 21:56.200
Of all the jobs that it would be hard to find out your friend does,

21:56.200 --> 22:01.880
I think like them banging on your door and arresting you.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.320
That's really rough.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.960
But I think a rougher one would be if you found out your friend was jigsaw.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.240
Because that would be very unfortunate to wake up and you're like,

22:11.800 --> 22:15.320
your butt has been manacled to someone else's butt.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.120
He's like, tear your own butts off if you want to live.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.720
And also, Greg, it's so nice to see you.

22:22.840 --> 22:26.680
Justin, just to clarify, you think the profession of cop is definitely hard,

22:26.680 --> 22:30.280
but much more difficult is the profession of serial killer.

22:30.280 --> 22:35.320
I'm saying it's hard to find out that your friend has been jigsawed the whole time.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.400
I'm saying that that would be very shocking.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.360
And that is an unfair association, Travis.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.680
Jigsaw is not just a serial killer.

22:42.680 --> 22:47.080
He also, like, it takes a lot of work to make all those bone mazes and stuff.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.000
Like, it's a lot of work.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.360
But this is, okay, you know what's hard?

22:52.360 --> 22:53.480
Finding out your friend's a cop.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.360
You know what's harder?

22:54.360 --> 22:57.480
Finding out that your friend is you from an alternate dimension but evil

22:57.480 --> 22:58.040
and send them to kill you.

22:58.040 --> 22:58.840
Oh, shit.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.520
Travis, that would definitely be hard.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.920
That would be really difficult.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.680
Find out that your friend is a robot sent from the future whose only job

23:06.680 --> 23:09.880
is to erase your existence before you, like, solve world peace.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.480
I hate that.

23:11.480 --> 23:12.920
Right, we've all been there.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.920
Who can I trust anymore?

23:16.360 --> 23:19.240
Pick up the bandsaw you find at your fi-

23:19.240 --> 23:20.200
I bought you this.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.240
I bought you this bandsaw.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.600
I bought you this for your birthday.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.880
Wait, no, this is my fucking bandsaw.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.240
I let you borrow it.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.520
Hey, yeah, wait a minute.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.520
This is what?

23:28.520 --> 23:30.600
You can have it back afterwards.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.440
You'll have to find the key.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.120
You gave me your spare keys.

23:34.120 --> 23:34.760
Oh.

23:34.760 --> 23:35.960
Oh, shit, that's right.

23:35.960 --> 23:36.680
Oh, yeah.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.200
Anyway, fill up this bucket with your own butt meat.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.880
No, and it'll raise the portcullis.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.320
I don't want to raise the portcullis.

23:45.560 --> 23:46.920
Is this your den?

23:46.920 --> 23:47.720
It is.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.360
It is my den.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.320
I love what you've done.

23:50.280 --> 23:54.200
Am I still going to see you for barbecue on Thursday?

23:54.200 --> 23:54.920
Yes, fine.

23:54.920 --> 23:55.320
Yes.

23:55.320 --> 23:56.840
We said we'd come.

23:56.840 --> 23:57.880
We said we'd be there.

23:57.880 --> 23:58.920
Guess what we're ha-

23:58.920 --> 24:00.440
I don't want to guess what we're having.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.200
Pork butt.

24:02.200 --> 24:05.880
I'll stick to potato salad and prepackaged Kroger cookies.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.440
Thank you.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.200
Guess what we're going to be having.

24:08.200 --> 24:12.040
Are you going to grill and cook my butt meat that I put in the bucket to counterweight

24:12.040 --> 24:13.240
the portcullis?

24:13.240 --> 24:15.560
No, we got kosher franks.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.520
Don't be a dick.

24:18.520 --> 24:19.960
Don't be a dick about this.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.880
I can't believe I have to explain this to you.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.120
The butt meat portcullis maze trap.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.640
It's supposed to teach you about the value of your life and stuff.

24:29.640 --> 24:30.600
I love you.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.320
I love you.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.800
You've just seemed really down lately and I want to make you appreciate the things that

24:35.800 --> 24:37.560
you have and the butt that you're left with.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.600
So can I go or are you two gonna-

24:40.600 --> 24:41.800
Hey, do you mind?

24:42.920 --> 24:44.200
We're working some shit out.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.600
Okay, I filled up the bucket with my butt meat to open the portcullis.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.400
Can I go?

24:49.400 --> 24:50.280
One moment.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.960
You're also under arrest.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.280
That's right.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.480
Officer Jigsaw.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Reporting for duty.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm also a doctor and a lawyer.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I have a lot of free time.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.840
Get in my patty wagon.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.680
Can I stand up in the patty wagon?

25:06.680 --> 25:07.800
Do I have to sit down?

25:07.800 --> 25:09.960
Because I have a situation back here now.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.800
I love you a lot.

25:11.800 --> 25:12.120
I know.

25:12.120 --> 25:12.920
We're good friends.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.800
I love you so much.

25:13.800 --> 25:14.920
We're really good friends.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.600
You introduced me to my wife.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.080
I did.

25:17.080 --> 25:17.720
That's right.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.120
Greg, sit up front.

25:20.120 --> 25:20.600
Come on.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.960
You don't need to ride the back patty wagon with that other wiener.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.480
But putting the music-

25:25.480 --> 25:26.760
Put a towel down.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.920
We'll listen to the new Adele album.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.320
I bought you that new-

25:33.320 --> 25:34.200
Thank you.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.880
You really know my tastes.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.080
It was a gift for my adult bar mitzvah.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.600
I'm the most interesting character the McElroy brothers have ever conceived.

25:46.280 --> 25:49.000
They've been sitting on me for a while which is ironic

25:49.000 --> 25:50.600
because you won't be sitting on anything.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.560
It's gonna be hard not to do that voice for a while.

25:59.560 --> 25:59.960
I know.

26:01.800 --> 26:02.120
Hold on.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.480
I left the radio on.

26:03.480 --> 26:03.800
Let me-

26:05.480 --> 26:06.520
Oh, I'm turning the radio up.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.160
I'm turning it up.

26:07.160 --> 26:07.640
I'm turning it up.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.840
I want a munch!

26:08.840 --> 26:09.320
Squad!

26:09.320 --> 26:09.880
Squad!

26:12.200 --> 26:14.200
I want two munch!

26:14.200 --> 26:14.840
Squad!

26:14.840 --> 26:15.480
Squad!

26:15.480 --> 26:17.640
Are you guys munch squads have gotten-

26:17.640 --> 26:20.840
Your squads have gotten a little bit tepid, okay?

26:20.840 --> 26:21.480
Okay, I don't-

26:21.480 --> 26:21.800
Really?

26:21.800 --> 26:25.080
I was actually just thinking how enthusiastic mine was comparatively.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.480
Yeah, I kind of tried to put a little bit more stink in it

26:27.480 --> 26:30.200
because like 10 minutes ago I definitely heard my baby wake up from a nap

26:30.200 --> 26:33.240
and I had the thought if munch squad rolls around I'll really be able to hit it.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.760
Okay, so listen.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.920
Arby's is done.

26:38.920 --> 26:39.560
Oh, shit.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.280
Okay, well-

26:40.280 --> 26:44.520
Usually when we feature people on the munch squad

26:44.520 --> 26:47.560
it's because they're so enthusiastic about the worst things they could do to people.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.480
Arby's brought back the smoke house pork belly sandwich to its restaurant.

26:55.480 --> 26:55.960
I remember.

26:57.160 --> 26:57.720
It's uh...

26:58.840 --> 27:01.880
If you remember last year Arby's went with no national restaurant chain

27:01.880 --> 27:06.600
gone before by offering pork belly also known as the bigger better bacon.

27:07.880 --> 27:12.440
Also known as an artisanal meat that I don't really trust you with in your hands.

27:12.440 --> 27:17.400
But that's also like saying steak it's hamburger too the sequel for better.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.200
But there's a quote here from Rob Lynch chief marketing officer

27:22.200 --> 27:25.000
and brand president of Arby's restaurant group.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.760
And this man sounds broken.

27:28.760 --> 27:31.880
The Arby's system has chewed him up and spit him out.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.680
Let's see what he's got to say about this sandwich.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.760
Our guests love pork belly.

27:39.320 --> 27:40.600
Said Rob Lynch chief marketing officer.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.960
Hey yo this sounds like my friend Detective Jigsaw.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.440
And brand president it's not uh whatever.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.640
More sigh Justin.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.840
When we launched it last year we weren't sure how well it would do

27:52.840 --> 27:58.920
because no one in our industry had done a slow smoked pork belly sandwich before.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.760
But the response was it was remarkable.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.760
Significantly exceeding our wildest expectations.

28:06.760 --> 28:12.040
So we worked hard to bring it back as soon as possible and here it is.

28:13.160 --> 28:17.000
Pork belly is just another example of our unique approach to food.

28:17.640 --> 28:21.000
Which is to offer innovation that our guests can only find at Arby's.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.040
And then the last sentence of this quote is this.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.840
We are really proud of this meat.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.360
We are really proud of this meat?

28:33.240 --> 28:34.840
We are really proud of this meat.

28:34.840 --> 28:39.400
So this sentence could I could I could interpret this so many ways.

28:42.040 --> 28:46.200
I've never seen somebody eat a bite of food and been proud of the food for

28:47.080 --> 28:50.440
maybe its courage or just its extreme quality.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.560
Are you proud of what the meat has done for your company?

28:55.560 --> 28:58.680
Is it are you proud of how you've prepared the meat?

28:58.680 --> 29:01.400
Maybe you should have said that instead.

29:01.400 --> 29:06.680
Well, considering you just said they had to work how far it's come because it was not originally pork belly,

29:06.680 --> 29:08.680
but it worked really hard to become it.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.640
Now it's pork.

29:09.640 --> 29:12.600
He just said they had to work hard to bring it back.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.840
So I maybe he's just proud of the effort that went into,

29:16.840 --> 29:22.360
I don't know, finding someone with the in a moral gray area willing to sell Arby's pork belly.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.000
Or maybe, Justin, maybe it's not that dark.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.040
Maybe it's just like the first time the pork belly sandwich rolled around.

29:28.040 --> 29:32.280
They sold so much of it that there was no more pork belly.

29:32.280 --> 29:38.120
They had to like like travel to the bottom of the ocean and find like aqua pigs or something that they could get pork belly from.

29:38.120 --> 29:43.080
And they're just proud of the exploration that they've achieved in mapping like the Mariana Trench

29:43.080 --> 29:48.680
to be able to find the mer pigs to get the aquatic bellies from.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.480
Yeah, yeah.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.280
So the new commercials are like Arby's.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.040
We have manatees.

29:54.040 --> 29:59.320
And you're going to you're going to it's going to drive you fucking crazy.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.320
You're going to lose.

30:01.320 --> 30:03.880
Each sandwich is forty eight dollars.

30:04.680 --> 30:09.560
They also brought back the the smoke mountain sandwich, which like.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.600
It's a literal mount.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.960
It's just eat it.

30:11.960 --> 30:12.680
Just eat it.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.520
It's what we've learned is the bigger it is, the happier our customers are.

30:16.520 --> 30:21.800
So we literally did some some explosive blast cap mountaintop removal

30:21.800 --> 30:24.520
and we put it between two big dumb slices of bread.

30:24.520 --> 30:25.560
Just go for it.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.600
We're done.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.240
I'm done.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.520
I'm Arby's and I'm done.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.800
There is a real smoke mountain, by the way.

30:31.800 --> 30:32.920
It's in North Carolina.

30:32.920 --> 30:33.720
Not anymore.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.560
This is in the Arby's sandwiches now.

30:35.560 --> 30:39.240
Big chunks of it like like we had to cut the top off a smoke mountain.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.080
It's like the fuck.

30:41.080 --> 30:45.800
It's just two pieces of bread and in between it is the trophy you get when you win on guts.

30:45.800 --> 30:51.320
That's lathered in some sort of horseradish cream.

30:53.480 --> 30:58.600
Let's let's let's take a break for a second and head on over to a little apartment.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.600
I like to think of as the money zone.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.600
Hey, everybody.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.640
First up this week.

31:13.640 --> 31:14.760
Hey, guys.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.760
Hey, buddy.

31:16.760 --> 31:17.960
Hey, hey, guys.

31:17.960 --> 31:18.440
Welcome to my-

31:18.440 --> 31:20.680
Hey, what's good fam?

31:20.680 --> 31:21.320
It's me.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.520
It's your boy, Justin Mackerel.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.840
I'm here to tell you about our sponsor, Blue Apron.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.640
I'm reviewing the 10 stinkiest fidget spinners.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.080
How did they get like this?

31:29.080 --> 31:29.480
Hey, guys.

31:29.480 --> 31:30.600
Hey, Tangleheads.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.720
It's me, Travis.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.480
I'm going to I'm going to be making a blue apron.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.040
There's going to be I'm going to be chewing some gum.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.280
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.

31:40.280 --> 31:43.000
Did you two make those fucking barbecue chicken wings, though?

31:43.000 --> 31:46.120
Did you all get those barbecue chicken wings from Blue Apron yet?

31:46.840 --> 31:51.320
No, but just last night I made a honey rhubarb chicken.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.120
Oh, I got that one.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.240
I haven't made it yet.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.720
Oh, it's real good.

31:55.720 --> 32:00.200
I only eat chili.

32:00.760 --> 32:01.560
Oh, that's right.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.600
Yeah, well, I'm on a restricted diet.

32:05.400 --> 32:09.400
Wait, wait, on your on your cheat days, you don't just have like eight blue aprons that

32:09.400 --> 32:10.440
you've saved up.

32:10.440 --> 32:17.560
So Justin's on that fucking Hank Hill cleanse or it's just chili and sweet tea and propane.

32:18.840 --> 32:23.160
For less than propane accessories for less than ten dollars per person for a meal.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.000
Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes along with

32:25.000 --> 32:28.840
pre-proportioned ingredients to make delicious home cooked meals.

32:28.840 --> 32:33.240
You want spicy zucchini enchiladas with creamy lime and tomato rice.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.360
You can have it.

32:34.360 --> 32:39.960
Elote style vegetable tostadas with summer squash, poblano peppers and cilantro rice.

32:39.960 --> 32:40.760
It's there for you.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.240
What's up on the menu this week?

32:43.240 --> 32:47.240
Well, you could check it out and get your first three meals for free with free shipping

32:47.240 --> 32:50.120
by going to BlueApron.com slash my brother.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.200
These are fresh, high quality ingredients.

32:52.200 --> 32:56.360
And also you can customize what meals you get sent to you, which has been really helpful

32:56.360 --> 33:00.200
for us because our baby has a food allergy.

33:00.200 --> 33:05.480
So like Rachel has to eat like very specific stuff and because we can kind of tailor the

33:05.480 --> 33:08.440
menu to what we want, like we can we can avoid that stuff.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.280
And it's been really very, very helpful.

33:10.280 --> 33:14.840
And they have a check box for like the whole thing made out of beans.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.280
Please make the whole thing out of beans.

33:17.640 --> 33:18.600
I love beans.

33:18.600 --> 33:19.800
I haven't seen that one.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.800
The box says beans ahoy.

33:23.800 --> 33:27.160
Whenever the delivery person drops off the box, Justin, I guess you can just say, wait,

33:27.160 --> 33:31.160
hold up and then cut the box open, grab the beans out from inside and then give the rest

33:31.160 --> 33:33.080
back and just say return to sender.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.000
Not a bad idea.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.800
I also love they let you just very, very, very easily skip weeks.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.800
So like if you're going to be out of town or if you weren't able to get to the last

33:43.800 --> 33:47.480
box for whatever reason and you still have like a meal sitting in your fridge, you just

33:47.480 --> 33:50.520
go on, say that you don't need it the next week and you just skip that week.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.080
That's it.

33:51.080 --> 33:51.480
That's enough.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.280
Clearly, we want to kiss and marry Blue Apron.

33:54.280 --> 33:54.840
That's it.

33:54.840 --> 33:59.320
Go to BlueApron.com slash my brother and you can get your first three meals for free with

33:59.320 --> 34:00.360
free shipping one last time.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.960
BlueApron.com slash my brother.

34:01.960 --> 34:07.160
I would like to tell you all about a service that's very near and dear to my heart and

34:07.160 --> 34:07.880
that is Lyft.

34:08.600 --> 34:12.680
And I think we've talked about Lyft before and I know that it's a super popular ride

34:12.680 --> 34:15.480
sharing service, but I love Lyft very much.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.960
We used it a ton when we were out in L.A.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.640
We use it here in Cincinnati.

34:19.640 --> 34:24.360
We use it whenever we travel, if, you know, there's lots of circumstances where you know

34:24.360 --> 34:27.640
you're not going to need like a rental car or something, but you need to get from place

34:27.640 --> 34:28.120
to place.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.880
And if Lyft's in that area, it's so incredibly useful and wonderful.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.240
And it's also really great for the drivers.

34:35.240 --> 34:39.160
You can tip the driver if you have a really great experience.

34:39.160 --> 34:42.360
And when they drive, they keep 100% of the tips.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.480
So it's great for the drivers.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.600
It's great for the riders.

34:45.400 --> 34:50.280
And you get to rate your driver and they rate you so that you kind of filter out the crappy

34:50.280 --> 34:50.760
people.

34:50.760 --> 34:54.200
So it's a really wonderful experience for everyone.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.360
I'm a big fan.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.640
I'm a big fan, if you haven't checked it out, you definitely should.

34:59.640 --> 35:04.760
So join the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better and not shitty.

35:05.320 --> 35:12.680
Go to Lyft, that's lyft.com slash brother today, and you can get a $500 new driver bonus

35:12.680 --> 35:14.280
if you start driving with them.

35:14.280 --> 35:20.520
So go to lyft.com slash brother, lyft.com slash brother, limited time only, terms apply.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.120
Go start driving for Lyft today.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.200
Hopefully, you don't have any kind of bad driving record like I did.

35:26.200 --> 35:33.160
But by bad driving record, do you mean current, present, in the car?

35:33.160 --> 35:34.840
No, I am a good driver now.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.880
I rear-ended someone on a wet, rainy street, Griffin.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.240
Just fucking drop it.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.440
It was years ago.

35:40.440 --> 35:41.320
Just stunting.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.000
It was years ago.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.120
Lyft's back in Austin.

35:44.120 --> 35:44.920
Squash that beef.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.200
Welcome back.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.240
Oh, that's nice.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.120
Baby, come back.

35:48.120 --> 35:48.680
I sang it.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.120
They couldn't resist.

35:50.120 --> 35:53.400
I have a personal Jumbotron message here, and it's for Booker.

35:53.400 --> 35:59.320
It's from Jeff, who says, happy birthday and happy anniversary to my fun-looking, fun-having

35:59.320 --> 36:00.280
dirty boy.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.320
Now that our lives have been completely, what?

36:03.320 --> 36:06.040
I just like that sentence.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.960
It's a very good Monster Factory goof.

36:07.960 --> 36:13.800
Now that our lives have been completely taken over by the McElroy media conglomerate, I

36:13.800 --> 36:18.200
can't think of any better way to celebrate than by having our favorite boys proclaim

36:18.200 --> 36:19.880
our gay love for each other.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.680
You are my frowny prince, and I love you forever.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.240
OK, hold on.

36:23.240 --> 36:23.960
Let's do this right.

36:25.640 --> 36:35.640
I hereby, henceforth, on June the 4th, 2017, the year of our Lord AD, by the power vested

36:35.640 --> 36:39.240
in me, hereby proclaim your gay love.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.760
So it is, and so it shall be.

36:44.280 --> 36:44.760
Amen.

36:44.760 --> 36:45.240
Amen.

36:45.240 --> 36:45.740
Amen.

36:45.740 --> 36:49.260
Man, you mentioned a factory of some sort?

36:49.260 --> 36:49.760
Hmm?

36:50.460 --> 36:51.820
You said something about a factory?

36:52.540 --> 36:57.180
It's a fun media fucking cross-media project that your other brothers make that I thought

36:57.180 --> 36:58.620
you'd be excited about.

36:58.620 --> 36:59.740
What do you do on this?

36:59.740 --> 37:01.260
What do you do on this media thing?

37:01.260 --> 37:02.060
I'm not doing this.

37:02.060 --> 37:02.780
I'm not doing this.

37:03.340 --> 37:04.780
Is it like funny, or?

37:05.420 --> 37:07.180
I got a message for Paul from Sunny.

37:07.180 --> 37:09.580
I guess not that funny, if it didn't attract your-

37:09.580 --> 37:10.940
This is the first time I'm hearing about it.

37:10.940 --> 37:12.540
No one's ever brought this up to me before.

37:12.540 --> 37:15.820
Sunny, I'm sorry, Paul and Sunny, they're stepping on your moment.

37:15.820 --> 37:16.780
Hey, sweetie.

37:16.780 --> 37:19.580
I'm just trying to learn about some kind of creative endeavor that my brothers might

37:19.580 --> 37:20.940
embark on without me.

37:20.940 --> 37:23.260
Okay, we've been doing it for like five years, but all right.

37:23.260 --> 37:23.660
Hey, sweetie.

37:23.660 --> 37:25.340
And how many times have you invited me to do it?

37:26.380 --> 37:28.060
I mean, like, we've invited you like ten times.

37:28.060 --> 37:29.340
Just check your texts, so.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.020
Well, I'm just, I'm really busy.

37:31.020 --> 37:33.500
I do a lot of podcasts, so like-

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
I don't remember getting invited to be on Schmaners.

37:35.500 --> 37:36.620
That was weird.

37:36.620 --> 37:37.500
Hey, sweetie!

37:37.500 --> 37:39.420
If you check your texts, I think there's like ten in there.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.100
I'm like, what do you know about museums?

37:41.100 --> 37:42.940
That's our latest episode, if anyone wants to check it out.

37:42.940 --> 37:43.740
We talked about museums.

37:43.740 --> 37:44.780
It was really great.

37:44.780 --> 37:45.020
All right.

37:45.820 --> 37:47.500
Okay, so, hey, sweetie.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.620
Who's this from, M2?

37:49.420 --> 37:52.380
Yeah, I've already said that, but it's from Sunny to Paul.

37:52.380 --> 37:52.860
Hi, Paul.

37:52.860 --> 37:53.500
Hi, Sunny.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.140
Welcome to the show.

37:54.140 --> 37:54.780
Hi!

37:54.780 --> 37:55.980
Come have a seat.

37:55.980 --> 37:56.540
Come on in.

37:57.180 --> 37:58.300
So irritated.

37:58.300 --> 37:59.020
Hey, sweetie.

37:59.580 --> 38:01.020
I love sharing my life with you.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.940
Ever since that doped up drive to get my dental implant.

38:04.940 --> 38:05.820
That seems unwise.

38:06.860 --> 38:08.780
Wait, you were doped up on your way there?

38:08.780 --> 38:12.540
I gotta get fucking baked if I'm going to get my teeth done.

38:13.180 --> 38:14.700
No way I'll do this straight.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.580
Ever since that doped up drive to get my dental implant,

38:20.140 --> 38:21.900
that has meant sharing the macaroons with you.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.220
Happy Father's Day, birthday, or anniversary.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.300
Sorry this isn't the adventure zone,

38:26.300 --> 38:28.220
but keep at least one eye open,

38:28.220 --> 38:30.620
because the boys just might pop in to wish you luck.

38:31.820 --> 38:32.140
Nope.

38:32.700 --> 38:32.860
No.

38:34.540 --> 38:35.660
Oh, are you looking for characters?

38:35.660 --> 38:37.660
We don't do character voices on that show.

38:37.660 --> 38:38.780
Why would we do them here?

38:39.580 --> 38:41.100
No, I think they were saying like,

38:41.100 --> 38:43.420
like watch out because we're there.

38:43.420 --> 38:44.300
I mean, that's a fun way.

38:44.300 --> 38:45.820
That's a fun way to consume the show.

38:45.820 --> 38:48.540
Just like constantly be waiting for one of us to just be like,

38:48.540 --> 38:50.380
uh, and then the, you know,

38:50.380 --> 38:54.460
the ogre smashes the magic mushroom forest.

38:54.460 --> 38:55.580
What's up, Paul?

38:55.580 --> 38:58.300
And then roll 10 dice to determine your,

38:59.260 --> 39:01.660
um, happy, happy Father's Day.

39:01.660 --> 39:02.860
Oh shit, that's coming up, huh?

39:02.860 --> 39:04.460
Oh man, I'm going to have that.

39:04.460 --> 39:05.020
Yeah!

39:05.020 --> 39:06.140
Fuck yeah!

39:06.140 --> 39:07.740
I'm getting myself a chop saw.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.500
Yeah, dude.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.860
I got a new fucking holiday.

39:10.860 --> 39:11.980
Are you kidding me?

39:11.980 --> 39:13.180
This would be like, Griffin, guess what?

39:13.900 --> 39:14.860
You got another birthday.

39:14.860 --> 39:15.820
What's up?

39:15.820 --> 39:17.180
It's like in the middle of June.

39:17.180 --> 39:17.900
Fuck yes.

39:18.860 --> 39:21.580
The cool thing is now you don't have to do anything for dad anymore.

39:21.580 --> 39:22.700
That's my favorite part.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.260
Are you kidding me?

39:23.260 --> 39:23.760
Yeah!

39:24.380 --> 39:25.420
Take that old man.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.620
What am I gonna, what am I gonna do?

39:26.620 --> 39:29.260
Send him another like fucking coupon

39:29.260 --> 39:31.660
for some online pepper jelly shop?

39:32.780 --> 39:33.740
Fuck yeah, dude.

39:33.740 --> 39:34.780
Are you kidding me?

39:34.780 --> 39:37.100
This is sick.

39:37.100 --> 39:38.860
Sim another picture of a Turfist Tumblr

39:38.860 --> 39:39.980
and be like, it's on the way.

39:39.980 --> 39:41.340
Sorry, I forgot.

39:41.340 --> 39:42.620
Installment plan.

39:42.620 --> 39:43.500
It's coming in.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.300
Fuck yeah, dude.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.340
Are you kidding me?

39:45.340 --> 39:46.540
New holiday.

39:46.540 --> 39:47.040
Yes.

39:47.660 --> 39:48.540
God yeah.

39:48.540 --> 39:50.380
Finally a day when it's all about me.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.020
Podcast.

39:53.020 --> 39:53.820
Podcast.

39:53.820 --> 39:54.460
Podcast.

39:55.740 --> 39:58.700
They're audio programs that tell smart stories

39:58.700 --> 39:59.820
in innovative ways

39:59.820 --> 40:01.420
using editing techniques like this.

40:01.420 --> 40:02.060
Like this.

40:02.060 --> 40:02.620
Like this?

40:02.620 --> 40:03.820
Like this?

40:03.820 --> 40:05.100
But let's face it,

40:05.100 --> 40:07.740
all that smart stuff can be exhausting.

40:07.740 --> 40:10.300
That's where Stop Podcasting Yourself comes in.

40:10.300 --> 40:11.580
It's so stupid.

40:11.580 --> 40:13.580
It's just two stupid dinguses

40:13.580 --> 40:15.740
being dumb idiot jerks for 90 minutes.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.220
Stop podcasting yourself.

40:18.220 --> 40:21.020
The stupid show that smart people love.

40:21.020 --> 40:21.980
Find it on iTunes

40:21.980 --> 40:23.820
or maximumfun.org.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.740
My sister can't tell the difference

40:25.740 --> 40:27.500
between Dennis Quaid and Tim Allen.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.940
Do I tell her or should I cut my losses

40:30.940 --> 40:33.020
and find a new sister?

40:33.020 --> 40:35.260
That's from Nicole from San Diego.

40:35.260 --> 40:37.180
How does this come up?

40:37.980 --> 40:39.260
Hey, do you remember that movie

40:39.260 --> 40:41.020
Santa Claus with Dennis Quaid?

40:41.020 --> 40:41.740
No.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.220
What?

40:43.020 --> 40:43.980
Are you sure?

40:43.980 --> 40:45.260
Are you sure Dennis Quaid?

40:45.260 --> 40:46.540
Look at these two pictures.

40:46.540 --> 40:47.660
One of them is Tim Allen.

40:47.660 --> 40:48.620
One is Dennis Quaid.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.100
Which one?

40:50.940 --> 40:53.740
Do you remember in Independence Day

40:53.740 --> 40:55.420
when Jim Allen drove the plane

40:55.420 --> 40:56.860
up into the mothership?

40:56.860 --> 40:57.500
Sorry, hold on.

40:57.500 --> 40:58.140
Wait.

40:58.140 --> 41:00.620
It's so deep that you think Tim Allen

41:00.620 --> 41:02.540
has a brother named Jim Allen

41:04.140 --> 41:06.140
who is in Independence Day.

41:06.140 --> 41:07.420
Do you think Dennis Quaid ever thinks

41:07.420 --> 41:09.180
about the fact that he didn't get to be

41:09.180 --> 41:10.060
in Independence Day

41:10.060 --> 41:12.060
and he gets just like really mad about it?

41:12.060 --> 41:13.740
Do you think that if Randy Quaid hadn't

41:13.740 --> 41:14.860
been in Independence Day

41:14.860 --> 41:16.620
that like Dennis Quaid would have been

41:16.620 --> 41:18.940
but you can only have one Quaid at a time?

41:18.940 --> 41:20.140
Well, the character

41:20.140 --> 41:21.500
and I don't want to speak ill of

41:22.540 --> 41:24.540
any Quaids, any and all Quaids

41:24.540 --> 41:26.780
but that character was a Randy Quaid character.

41:26.780 --> 41:27.820
I think we can all agree on that.

41:27.820 --> 41:29.420
It wouldn't have been the same Quaid

41:29.420 --> 41:31.420
but it's like a one Quaid in, one Quaid out

41:31.420 --> 41:32.940
kind of scenario where like

41:32.940 --> 41:34.380
because Randy Quaid was in it

41:34.380 --> 41:36.140
Dennis Quaid couldn't play like

41:37.100 --> 41:38.220
Jeff Goldblum's dad.

41:38.780 --> 41:39.580
It would have been like

41:39.580 --> 41:40.540
he could have played that character

41:40.540 --> 41:41.500
but all of a sudden the character

41:41.500 --> 41:42.860
would be like really cool

41:42.860 --> 41:44.060
and everybody just believes him

41:44.060 --> 41:45.500
about the alien stuff.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.020
And he can pitch really fast.

41:47.020 --> 41:49.180
He can pitch super fast.

41:49.180 --> 41:51.100
It's actually really weird to me.

41:52.140 --> 41:55.100
A lot of brothers like the Afflecks

41:55.100 --> 41:57.340
and so on you can't say this about.

41:57.340 --> 42:01.100
Well, I don't think there's a Dennis Quaid role

42:01.660 --> 42:04.380
that you could slide Randy into.

42:04.380 --> 42:05.820
Yeah, right.

42:05.820 --> 42:07.580
I don't think that that works.

42:07.580 --> 42:09.980
I don't think they're interchangeable whatsoever.

42:09.980 --> 42:11.100
No, it's actually

42:11.100 --> 42:13.020
if you're looking at the scope, Justin

42:13.020 --> 42:15.180
the Estevez brothers, right?

42:15.740 --> 42:17.260
They're over here.

42:17.260 --> 42:18.940
That's the most replay

42:18.940 --> 42:20.700
because they no joke.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.300
I've seen a lot of movies

42:22.300 --> 42:25.900
that I've said like, oh, that's Martin Sheen.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.020
No, no, no.

42:27.020 --> 42:28.300
That's his brother

42:28.300 --> 42:30.380
who looks like his doppelganger.

42:30.380 --> 42:31.500
And then you have Randy Quaid

42:31.500 --> 42:33.180
and Dennis Quaid on the other end

42:33.180 --> 42:36.220
who you have to convince me are related.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.100
Dennis Quaid.

42:38.540 --> 42:40.380
I'm trying to think of a mnemonic device

42:40.380 --> 42:42.300
so maybe we can be helpful here for once.

42:43.340 --> 42:44.620
Like leaves of three, let it be.

42:45.420 --> 42:47.420
Leaves of Quaid.

42:48.460 --> 42:49.100
You know what I mean?

42:49.100 --> 42:50.780
Something that there's a like a funny

42:50.780 --> 42:51.980
like if I could think of something

42:51.980 --> 42:53.740
that would be like a joke, a funny joke.

42:53.740 --> 42:57.420
If it's Dennis, let it finish acting.

42:57.420 --> 42:59.340
If it's Randy, it's not Dan.

42:59.340 --> 43:02.300
Okay, no, we're not speaking about Randy Quaid.

43:02.300 --> 43:05.420
We're speaking about Timothy Allen.

43:05.980 --> 43:06.860
Oh, I see.

43:06.860 --> 43:07.420
I see.

43:07.420 --> 43:08.700
That was the original pitch.

43:08.700 --> 43:11.100
If there's growling, that's Tim Allen.

43:11.100 --> 43:11.660
Okay.

43:11.660 --> 43:13.180
He has to do it in every movie.

43:15.660 --> 43:17.580
And then I mean that by that point

43:17.580 --> 43:18.940
it's just process of elimination.

43:18.940 --> 43:22.620
You only have to remember one of them.

43:24.620 --> 43:27.340
If it's growling, it's Tim Allen, dot, dot, dot.

43:28.780 --> 43:32.940
We've sort of created sort of an if-then operation here.

43:34.220 --> 43:37.260
If Tim Allen go to line 10.

43:38.620 --> 43:43.180
If growling go to line 10, print, it's Tim Allen.

43:44.060 --> 43:46.460
Otherwise, it sounds like you got yourself

43:46.460 --> 43:50.220
one of the Quaid brothers on your hands.

43:50.220 --> 43:56.060
Sydney used to have a thing where she just biologically

43:56.060 --> 43:59.580
could not tell the difference between Bob Hoskins

43:59.580 --> 44:00.860
and Danny DeVito.

44:00.860 --> 44:04.060
That's completely unimaginable.

44:05.180 --> 44:07.180
It's easier to remember now, of course.

44:07.740 --> 44:12.060
But over the years, she had a lot of trouble

44:12.060 --> 44:15.260
distinguishing Danny DeVito and Bob Hoskins.

44:15.260 --> 44:17.740
And then it got to a point where I felt like

44:17.740 --> 44:19.100
she was probably trolling me.

44:20.060 --> 44:22.060
Like when she couldn't separate Bon Jovi

44:22.060 --> 44:23.660
and Bruce Springsteen for a long time,

44:23.660 --> 44:24.620
which I think is an elaborate joke.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.220
That was a joke that was played on you.

44:27.260 --> 44:28.700
Can I hit you with a good Yahoo?

44:28.700 --> 44:29.340
I have so many.

44:29.340 --> 44:30.540
Thank you to everybody who sent them in.

44:31.260 --> 44:33.180
Yes, but know that while you do,

44:33.180 --> 44:36.540
there is a pair of actors that I can't tell the difference

44:36.540 --> 44:39.180
between whose names I also can't remember right this second.

44:39.180 --> 44:40.700
So I'll be looking that up.

44:40.700 --> 44:41.260
Awesome.

44:41.260 --> 44:42.140
Can't wait.

44:42.140 --> 44:42.620
Can't wait.

44:43.340 --> 44:44.620
This one was sent in by Kevin Budnick.

44:44.620 --> 44:45.100
Thank you, Kevin.

44:45.100 --> 44:47.180
Kevin did our, I don't know if you have seen them,

44:47.180 --> 44:51.020
but the live show posters that we had in Austin.

44:51.020 --> 44:52.540
We still have a fuck ton of.

44:52.540 --> 44:54.940
We need to figure out like what to do with this.

44:54.940 --> 44:56.380
I don't know what to do with a bunch of posters.

44:58.380 --> 44:59.020
People bought them.

44:59.020 --> 44:59.980
They just gave us too many.

44:59.980 --> 45:02.140
They gave us double the amount that we bought,

45:02.140 --> 45:03.980
which is like a bank error in our favor.

45:03.980 --> 45:04.940
That was pretty tight.

45:04.940 --> 45:08.140
It's Christopher Maloney and Elias Kodius.

45:09.340 --> 45:10.300
That's legit, Trav.

45:10.300 --> 45:11.340
That's legit.

45:11.340 --> 45:13.660
Yeah, Christopher Maloney is on Law and Order

45:13.660 --> 45:17.020
and Elias Kodius played Casey Jones

45:17.020 --> 45:18.220
in the Ninja Turtles movie.

45:19.660 --> 45:21.500
They could be brothers.

45:21.500 --> 45:21.980
Oh yeah.

45:21.980 --> 45:22.300
All right.

45:22.300 --> 45:22.700
I see it.

45:22.700 --> 45:23.180
Okay.

45:23.180 --> 45:24.540
So anyway, this question from Kevin.

45:24.540 --> 45:25.340
Thank you, Kevin.

45:25.340 --> 45:27.660
It's by Yahoo Answers user John asks,

45:29.100 --> 45:33.980
are there specific names for colors we cannot see?

45:34.620 --> 45:36.940
For example, we call light with a wavelength

45:36.940 --> 45:41.980
of about 650 nanometers, I suppose, red and et cetera.

45:41.980 --> 45:44.460
If the wavelengths are beyond the visible spectrum,

45:44.460 --> 45:45.980
are there specific names for the colors?

45:45.980 --> 45:51.100
And I'm not looking for infrared, x-ray, gamma, microwave, et cetera.

45:51.100 --> 45:54.220
If either of you try to drop some fucking Mr. Wizard bullshit

45:54.220 --> 45:55.980
on us right now to prove how smart you are,

45:57.740 --> 45:58.620
I'll leave the call.

45:58.620 --> 46:02.060
But is there names for reds like on the end of the spectrum?

46:02.060 --> 46:06.300
And then there's probably some rays and ultra violets

46:06.300 --> 46:07.100
and all that stuff.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.260
I just think about this all the time.

46:11.260 --> 46:15.420
What if I turn the corner and there was just a new frigging color?

46:15.420 --> 46:16.860
Griffin, here's the problem.

46:16.860 --> 46:17.420
Can I tell you?

46:17.980 --> 46:20.220
I don't know much about scientists,

46:21.260 --> 46:25.340
but they probably just call it like super red or like ultra green.

46:25.340 --> 46:26.780
Very red.

46:26.780 --> 46:27.180
Yeah.

46:27.180 --> 46:27.580
Right?

46:27.580 --> 46:31.020
Like, come on, scientists.

46:31.020 --> 46:31.900
This is not a...

46:32.620 --> 46:33.260
Okay.

46:33.260 --> 46:37.340
I don't know if you people are joking.

46:37.340 --> 46:38.940
It's all up to interpretations.

46:38.940 --> 46:47.020
There is, I mean, the idea of color is an invention that we created.

46:47.020 --> 46:51.820
We named certain points in the spectrum of light, right?

46:51.820 --> 46:54.460
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. deGrasse Tyson.

46:54.460 --> 46:57.500
Yeah, sorry, I didn't know we had Mr. Dr. deGrasse Tyson on our show.

46:57.500 --> 47:01.740
But like, infrared encompasses like the entirety of the spectrum.

47:01.740 --> 47:04.060
You're walking down the block, Justin.

47:04.060 --> 47:08.700
You're walking down to the book shop.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.340
Shop or vegetable store.

47:11.980 --> 47:15.180
And you're walking and you turn the corner and just like,

47:15.180 --> 47:18.540
wow, there's a color you've never seen before.

47:18.540 --> 47:19.740
It's not purple.

47:19.740 --> 47:20.860
It ain't red.

47:20.860 --> 47:21.900
It ain't orange.

47:21.900 --> 47:22.540
It's not brown.

47:22.540 --> 47:26.140
Griffin, Griffin, Griffin, Griffin.

47:26.860 --> 47:33.260
What if there are animals all around us and their colors are ones we just can't see?

47:33.260 --> 47:34.220
Oh, beans.

47:34.220 --> 47:34.940
Oh, no.

47:34.940 --> 47:35.820
Are they dangerous?

47:35.820 --> 47:38.140
I don't know, Griffin.

47:38.860 --> 47:39.340
Are they?

47:39.900 --> 47:40.380
Shit.

47:41.500 --> 47:43.020
God, Trav, fuck, man.

47:44.460 --> 47:46.140
These are very red.

47:46.140 --> 47:46.620
And that-

47:46.620 --> 47:49.900
Yeah, like an infrared bear coming right at you.

47:49.900 --> 47:52.700
These cones can't see that bear.

47:52.700 --> 47:53.260
Oh, no.

47:53.260 --> 47:53.760
Right?

47:54.380 --> 47:56.220
What do you even do?

47:56.220 --> 47:57.740
What do you do, Justin?

47:57.740 --> 47:59.260
What do you do, Justin?

47:59.260 --> 48:00.780
Justin, get in here, dude.

48:00.780 --> 48:02.860
This play space is fun, dude.

48:02.860 --> 48:04.780
Get the fuck in here, man.

48:04.780 --> 48:09.100
To give you the setup in case you were looking at pictures of Elias Kodius,

48:09.100 --> 48:13.180
we're talking about like bears and wild animals that are like colors we can't see.

48:13.180 --> 48:14.060
So get in the space.

48:14.060 --> 48:14.380
Here we go.

48:14.380 --> 48:19.820
You're like ultraviolet and infrared bears that you just can't see.

48:19.820 --> 48:20.860
It doesn't make sense.

48:21.660 --> 48:24.300
Maybe there's even like a whole infrared world.

48:24.300 --> 48:26.620
Every time you stub your toe and you turn and you're like,

48:26.620 --> 48:27.100
what was that?

48:27.100 --> 48:28.380
Oh, I thought it was a chair.

48:28.380 --> 48:29.740
The chair seemed out of my way.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.660
You tripped over an infrared chair.

48:31.660 --> 48:32.460
Oh, gosh.

48:32.460 --> 48:36.700
What if they're real little and we're always stepping on them?

48:36.700 --> 48:41.580
Or what if we're real little and there's infrared giants stepping on us?

48:41.580 --> 48:42.300
Jesus.

48:43.420 --> 48:44.700
Oh, man.

48:45.420 --> 48:48.860
Maybe if you get like goose pimples or whatever,

48:48.860 --> 48:51.420
that's an infrared giant just messing with you.

48:51.420 --> 48:51.900
Shit.

48:51.900 --> 48:52.220
Right?

48:52.220 --> 48:53.500
Tickling me.

48:54.620 --> 48:54.860
Fuck.

48:54.860 --> 48:55.120
Ow.

48:56.220 --> 48:58.060
Just what do you even?

48:58.780 --> 48:59.740
What do you do?

48:59.740 --> 49:01.820
What do we do now that we've figured this out?

49:01.820 --> 49:04.620
We've seen through the veil.

49:05.820 --> 49:06.300
We've seen-

49:06.300 --> 49:07.340
We've seen-

49:07.340 --> 49:10.940
We've parted the curtain into another world that's all around us.

49:10.940 --> 49:11.580
What do we do?

49:11.580 --> 49:13.020
What do I do now?

49:13.020 --> 49:16.860
I can't go back to, you know, I'll never get in the car again.

49:16.860 --> 49:18.460
Every time I get in the car and drive from one place to another,

49:18.460 --> 49:21.980
I probably hit like 10 invisible deer or whatever.

49:22.620 --> 49:24.620
You've killed eight infrared bears.

49:24.620 --> 49:28.460
Just like going to the toy store to get a fidget spinner.

49:29.260 --> 49:29.580
Shit.

49:29.580 --> 49:32.620
Wait, I was going to get the fidget spinner or the bears were?

49:32.620 --> 49:33.500
Because I'm into either.

49:33.500 --> 49:34.220
Both.

49:34.220 --> 49:34.460
Okay.

49:34.460 --> 49:35.900
You were going the same direction.

49:35.900 --> 49:37.100
That's how you ran into them.

49:38.300 --> 49:40.860
I don't want to know how to break this to you guys.

49:43.020 --> 49:45.420
There are animals that can see ultraviolet.

49:46.460 --> 49:48.940
Well, that's why your dog gets really nervous sometimes.

49:48.940 --> 49:53.900
Yes, butterflies can see ultraviolet.

49:53.900 --> 49:55.180
How do you know, Justin?

49:55.180 --> 49:56.300
Do you speak butterfly?

49:57.660 --> 49:57.980
Got it.

49:57.980 --> 50:00.620
That is actually a pretty good question.

50:00.620 --> 50:02.140
How the fuck do we figure that out?

50:03.260 --> 50:03.820
Did you?

50:08.220 --> 50:09.580
I feel like you're trying to tell me something

50:09.580 --> 50:13.100
about like some incredible invisible ecosystem

50:13.100 --> 50:14.380
that I'm just not tapped into.

50:14.380 --> 50:14.940
Am I close?

50:15.660 --> 50:19.340
Did you use ultraviolet light to shine a sign above a little hole

50:19.340 --> 50:22.620
that said super horny butterflies down to fuck?

50:23.180 --> 50:25.100
Come on in if you're ready to party.

50:25.100 --> 50:27.980
A reindeer can see ultraviolet light too.

50:27.980 --> 50:28.460
Whoa.

50:28.460 --> 50:29.900
Do you think that's why Santa picked him?

50:30.540 --> 50:32.780
Reindeers are the only mammals that can see ultraviolet light.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.300
Do you think that's why Santa was like-

50:34.300 --> 50:35.340
Oh, yeah.

50:35.340 --> 50:37.420
I want to get one up on these motherfuckers.

50:37.420 --> 50:40.620
Yeah, I'm not trying to fly into a flock of invisible birds of prey.

50:43.420 --> 50:45.660
When butterflies fuck, I guess caterpillar comes out,

50:45.660 --> 50:47.180
you think they're disappointed every time?

50:51.820 --> 50:52.460
He looks like-

50:52.460 --> 50:55.820
They look at the caterpillar and they can see an ultraviolet butterfly

50:55.820 --> 50:56.780
spreading out from it?

50:56.780 --> 50:57.820
Oh, shit.

50:57.820 --> 50:59.180
This is beautiful.

50:59.180 --> 51:00.940
Are you saying that parents are disappointed?

51:01.820 --> 51:03.180
Oh, sweetie, he looks like-

51:03.180 --> 51:03.980
Oh, no.

51:03.980 --> 51:05.900
He's a worm like we used to be.

51:05.900 --> 51:06.460
Shoot.

51:06.460 --> 51:11.660
I was hoping maybe this time it'd be one of us beautiful.

51:11.660 --> 51:13.420
You know that armadillos are the only animals

51:13.420 --> 51:14.860
that can see into the future?

51:14.860 --> 51:15.340
Oh, no.

51:16.380 --> 51:17.660
Yeah, they just know.

51:19.820 --> 51:21.580
If you see an armadillo clear a room,

51:21.580 --> 51:23.260
you better follow right behind.

51:23.820 --> 51:25.740
He knows a piano's about to fall through the ceiling.

51:25.740 --> 51:26.460
Oh, no.

51:27.020 --> 51:28.780
Oh, no, he rolled into a ball.

51:28.780 --> 51:30.060
The piano fell through the ceiling.

51:30.060 --> 51:31.020
He saw this coming.

51:31.020 --> 51:31.980
Well, this is weird.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.340
I also just got my zoo books in the mail.

51:35.340 --> 51:36.460
It says turtles never die.

51:37.180 --> 51:37.980
Turtles live forever.

51:37.980 --> 51:39.740
There's only ever been like a hundred turtles,

51:39.740 --> 51:40.620
but it's the same one.

51:40.620 --> 51:41.180
It's crazy.

51:41.820 --> 51:44.220
Trav, did you know that's because armadillos

51:44.220 --> 51:47.500
get tomorrow's newspaper a day early every day?

51:49.340 --> 51:50.540
I did know that.

51:50.540 --> 51:53.100
Okay, I didn't know if you knew that or not.

51:53.100 --> 51:53.580
Okay.

51:53.580 --> 51:54.460
I did, actually.

51:54.460 --> 51:55.260
I just want to...

51:55.260 --> 51:56.940
Is there a color we don't know about yet

51:56.940 --> 51:58.780
that I'm going to see before I pass?

51:58.780 --> 52:01.180
In my lifetime, am I going to see this color?

52:01.180 --> 52:01.820
What if we came up...

52:01.820 --> 52:03.180
Let's come up with the color right now,

52:03.180 --> 52:05.660
and that'll be our legacy.

52:05.660 --> 52:06.300
This will be like,

52:06.300 --> 52:07.260
did you see this new color?

52:07.260 --> 52:07.760
And be like,

52:08.540 --> 52:09.100
whoa, that is...

52:09.100 --> 52:09.820
I've never seen...

52:09.820 --> 52:10.700
It's like blue,

52:10.700 --> 52:12.620
but it's not anything I've ever seen before.

52:12.620 --> 52:14.940
Griffin, I could try to make up a funny name,

52:14.940 --> 52:15.820
but there's already a colorful piece.

52:15.820 --> 52:16.380
I don't want a name.

52:16.380 --> 52:17.020
I don't want a name.

52:17.020 --> 52:20.780
The shade, the hue.

52:20.780 --> 52:22.140
So like, I'll close your eyes.

52:22.140 --> 52:23.100
Both of you guys close your eyes.

52:23.820 --> 52:24.460
Imagine...

52:25.020 --> 52:26.380
Let's start with...

52:27.420 --> 52:28.940
Imagine orange.

52:30.460 --> 52:31.980
You see an orange, the color?

52:33.180 --> 52:35.820
And now we're just going to put a little bit...

52:36.940 --> 52:39.820
Just a little bit of purple in there.

52:39.820 --> 52:42.380
Can you even imagine like what that meant?

52:42.380 --> 52:43.900
Like, try to blend it,

52:43.900 --> 52:46.460
and you're seeing a color you never saw before.

52:46.460 --> 52:51.820
What if the color is every color altogether,

52:51.820 --> 52:53.660
and that's the shade you can't see?

52:53.660 --> 52:55.900
Cheating, cheating, cheating, cheating.

52:55.900 --> 52:58.060
Or what if it's none of the colors?

52:58.060 --> 52:58.860
What if it's red?

52:58.860 --> 53:00.060
What if you take blue?

53:01.980 --> 53:03.580
Imagine the purest blue,

53:04.940 --> 53:06.940
and then add some yellow in there.

53:08.460 --> 53:09.340
How much yellow?

53:10.220 --> 53:10.940
However much...

53:12.780 --> 53:13.820
10 amount.

53:13.820 --> 53:14.620
10 yellows?

53:14.620 --> 53:15.180
Not too much.

53:15.180 --> 53:20.700
Yeah, and can your mind even...

53:20.700 --> 53:22.380
The color, Griffin?

53:22.380 --> 53:24.380
Let me tell you the shade.

53:24.380 --> 53:26.940
The shade is the color that you would get

53:26.940 --> 53:29.660
if you were able to push down all the tabs

53:29.660 --> 53:31.980
on the multicolored pen at once.

53:31.980 --> 53:32.460
Okay.

53:33.020 --> 53:34.620
That would be the color you wouldn't adopt.

53:34.620 --> 53:36.620
There's a reason you can't do that.

53:36.620 --> 53:38.140
CERN made those pins,

53:38.620 --> 53:40.220
and made it so you couldn't do that,

53:40.220 --> 53:42.620
or else you'll like punch a hole in space-time.

53:42.620 --> 53:45.340
Sydney got one of those pins in the 90s box

53:45.340 --> 53:47.660
that you and Rachel got her for her birthday,

53:47.660 --> 53:50.540
and it made me realize, one, those rule,

53:50.540 --> 53:52.940
two, I have not seen one in a grip.

53:52.940 --> 53:54.940
I don't know if they're still making those bad boys or not,

53:54.940 --> 53:55.580
but those are rad.

53:55.580 --> 53:56.860
Well, no, they're irresponsible

53:56.860 --> 53:58.380
because you push all three tabs down.

53:58.380 --> 53:59.820
See, a color you've never seen before,

53:59.820 --> 54:03.340
you go full-blown Lovecraft-like bonkers.

54:03.340 --> 54:05.260
You've made your own hadron collider.

54:05.260 --> 54:07.820
Well, folks, that's stupid.

54:07.820 --> 54:09.180
It's just stupid.

54:09.180 --> 54:09.740
The whole thing is dumb.

54:09.740 --> 54:12.540
I mean, I said if you combine blue and yellow,

54:12.540 --> 54:13.980
you make a color you've never seen before,

54:13.980 --> 54:16.940
and you two chucklefucks didn't say anything.

54:19.020 --> 54:22.700
It just, sometimes, guys, what are we doing here?

54:23.980 --> 54:25.500
Thanks for listening, though.

54:25.500 --> 54:26.940
We really do appreciate you.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.300
We hope you have fun listening.

54:31.420 --> 54:35.820
Trav, do you want to make the PodCon pitch one last time?

54:35.820 --> 54:36.780
Thank you very much.

54:36.780 --> 54:40.700
We are in the middle, right now, as we speak,

54:40.700 --> 54:43.900
raising funds to put on a podcast convention

54:43.900 --> 54:45.420
in Seattle this December.

54:46.060 --> 54:49.420
It is organized by me and the brothers McElroy,

54:50.380 --> 54:54.460
Hank and John Green, and the people behind

54:54.460 --> 54:57.020
Welcome to Night Vale, Joseph and Jeffrey,

54:57.020 --> 54:58.940
Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor.

54:58.940 --> 55:03.020
And it is both a chance to go and see

55:03.020 --> 55:07.980
some of your favorite podcast and podcasters perform live,

55:07.980 --> 55:10.060
but also a chance to get together with people

55:10.060 --> 55:13.740
who are not only fans, but also creators of podcasters,

55:13.740 --> 55:17.100
talk about the art form of podcasting.

55:18.300 --> 55:22.140
And you can help us make it a reality

55:22.140 --> 55:24.540
by going to podcon.com.

55:24.540 --> 55:27.580
We are doing an Indiegogo fundraiser right now.

55:27.580 --> 55:29.180
We're at about halfway there.

55:29.180 --> 55:32.540
And not only can you help us fund PodCon,

55:32.540 --> 55:34.300
but you also get, well, there's a whole bunch

55:34.300 --> 55:36.700
of different levels with a bunch of different rewards,

55:36.700 --> 55:39.260
including remote attendance.

55:39.260 --> 55:42.060
So even if you're not able to make it to Seattle

55:42.060 --> 55:44.620
on December 9th and 10th, you'll still be able

55:44.620 --> 55:48.700
to watch the shows and still be able to participate remotely.

55:48.700 --> 55:50.620
So go to podcon.com.

55:50.620 --> 55:53.660
When you hear this, you'll only have till,

55:53.660 --> 55:55.580
I believe, Tuesday at midnight.

55:55.580 --> 55:56.860
So there's not much time left.

55:56.860 --> 56:01.860
So go to podcon.com and then Tuesday from,

56:02.380 --> 56:04.780
I think like seven to midnight, somewhere around there,

56:04.780 --> 56:09.780
we'll be doing a live stream with like Hank and me

56:10.860 --> 56:14.620
and some people from Night Vale and other people

56:14.620 --> 56:17.340
to kind of help get the word out.

56:17.340 --> 56:20.540
So I'll tweet about that so you can keep an eye out.

56:20.540 --> 56:21.820
But yeah, we're really excited.

56:21.820 --> 56:23.500
We're gonna be doing a live My Brother, My Brother,

56:23.500 --> 56:24.860
and Me there.

56:24.860 --> 56:29.860
Also, Alice Isn't Dead, Dear Hank and John, Bad With Money,

56:30.060 --> 56:34.900

56:34.900 --> 56:39.900
A Night Called Tomorrow, Lore, Criminal.

56:41.420 --> 56:45.220
It's a really amazing lineup already.

56:45.220 --> 56:46.340
And it's just gonna get better.

56:46.340 --> 56:49.620
Yeah, like we're near done inviting people.

56:49.620 --> 56:51.420
There's a show called Last Name Basis

56:51.420 --> 56:53.700
that like we just announced that I'm really excited about.

56:53.700 --> 56:55.000
I'm a big fan of theirs.

56:55.860 --> 56:59.860
And it's going to be a really good time.

56:59.860 --> 57:02.140
And we hope you all show up.

57:02.140 --> 57:06.220
But you can help us fund it, podcon.com.

57:06.220 --> 57:07.380
Thank you so much.

57:07.380 --> 57:09.020
I wanna thank John Roderick and Long Winters

57:09.020 --> 57:11.100
for using our theme song, It's a Departure,

57:11.100 --> 57:14.760
which is a song off of the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.460
It's a very good album that honestly,

57:16.460 --> 57:17.740
I haven't listened to in a little bit.

57:17.740 --> 57:18.780
I need to dip in.

57:18.780 --> 57:20.700
I like to recharge the old batteries every once in a while.

57:20.700 --> 57:21.780
You know what I mean?

57:21.780 --> 57:23.540
I also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us.

57:23.540 --> 57:24.500

57:37.360 --> 57:41.700
or watch our videos, all of those are at McElroyShows.com.

57:42.780 --> 57:44.620
Speaking of stuff that we do, Justin,

57:44.620 --> 57:46.020
do you wanna give a quick plug

57:46.020 --> 57:48.180
to our new Prestige podcast?

57:48.180 --> 57:49.940
Yes, we have a new podcast.

57:49.940 --> 57:53.740
It's called The McElroy Brothers Will Be in Trolls 2.

57:53.740 --> 57:58.340
You can find that on iTunes or Trolls2.Libson.com.

57:58.340 --> 57:59.980
That's right, we don't even have a website for it.

57:59.980 --> 58:01.780
That's how new it is.

58:01.780 --> 58:02.620
It's also on Twitter.

58:02.620 --> 58:03.840
I have no idea where.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.500
But we're trying to get in Trolls.

58:05.500 --> 58:07.100
No, we are in Trolls 2.

58:07.100 --> 58:09.140
We will be in Trolls 2.

58:09.140 --> 58:11.780
And this is a story about how it happens,

58:11.780 --> 58:13.260
but it's happening in real time.

58:13.260 --> 58:14.620
So it'll be archival.

58:15.500 --> 58:16.740
There's gonna be a lot of big developments.

58:16.740 --> 58:18.020
We just got two episodes up.

58:18.020 --> 58:19.700
The pilot that we released on this feed,

58:19.700 --> 58:24.180
and also the second episode with our hilarious agent Joel.

58:24.180 --> 58:26.600
And it's really fun.

58:27.860 --> 58:28.820
And it's great.

58:28.820 --> 58:30.460
So...

58:30.460 --> 58:31.500
Go check it out.

58:31.500 --> 58:32.740
Go check it out, totally.

58:32.740 --> 58:33.660
Totally check it out.

58:33.660 --> 58:34.700
One more quick plug.

58:34.700 --> 58:37.180
We have a TV show on CISO.com.

58:37.180 --> 58:40.920
And we put out on our podcast thread,

58:40.920 --> 58:45.920
on this very feed, an episode one commentary

58:46.380 --> 58:47.900
that you can listen to of us talk about

58:47.900 --> 58:51.860
making the show and stories on set and that kind of thing.

58:51.860 --> 58:53.140
So go to CISO.com.

58:53.140 --> 58:55.140
And now it's also available on iTunes

58:55.140 --> 58:57.980
in countries outside of the US.

58:57.980 --> 59:02.980
So I think it's the UK, Canada, Germany, Australia,

59:03.780 --> 59:06.060
and maybe other places as well.

59:06.060 --> 59:08.220
I'm not 100% sure about Germany.

59:08.220 --> 59:09.260
Now that I say it,

59:09.260 --> 59:10.860
I don't know if that sounds right or not.

59:10.860 --> 59:14.300
But go to your version of iTunes and find out.

59:14.300 --> 59:18.300
And then go to our feed

59:18.300 --> 59:21.020
and listen to the commentary on episode one.

59:21.020 --> 59:22.340
Hopefully we'll do more of those.

59:22.340 --> 59:23.460
No guarantees.

59:23.460 --> 59:25.740
We've already recorded episode two commentary though.

59:25.740 --> 59:28.500
So hopefully that'll be up in the future.

59:28.500 --> 59:29.840
Here's that final.

59:29.840 --> 59:32.460
This final was, weird enough, sent in by two people,

59:32.460 --> 59:33.900
JJ Jones and Nick Potter.

59:33.900 --> 59:34.900
Independently sent this in.

59:34.900 --> 59:36.100
Thank you, both.

59:36.100 --> 59:37.580
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

59:37.580 --> 59:42.580
Piccione, it says.

59:44.740 --> 59:45.660
I'm gonna add a little bit here.

59:45.660 --> 59:48.580
A little bit of flavor here at the beginning.

59:48.580 --> 59:53.580
Hey, you like pigeons?

59:55.660 --> 01:00:00.660
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.620
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.860
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.020
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.540
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.220
Maximumfun.org.

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.260
Comedy and culture.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.340
Artist owned.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.540
Listener supported.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.660
Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.060
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.900
Every week we release a medical history podcast

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.620
called Sawbones.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.100
We go over the history of the dumbest, grossest,

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.500
weirdest stuff humans have been doing to each other

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.140
since the dawn of mankind.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.740
But it's a funny show.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.500
But it's also so disgusting and stomach turning,

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.980
you won't believe it.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.300
But it's also like, funny, it's funny.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.460
It is the wildest, grossest, nastiest stuff you can imagine.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.420
It's a real hoot.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.660
It's called Sawbones and we release it every week

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.020
on iTunes, wherever podcasts are sold,

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:35.020
and right here on Maximumfun.org.
