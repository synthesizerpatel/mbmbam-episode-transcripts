00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.880
Well, I'm your middle-est brother, but for the purposes of this, I'm your youngest brother, too.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.600
I'm both. I'm both brothers. I'm the middle-est and the youngest.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.480
Yes, because we are without Griffin right now. Don't worry,

01:02.480 --> 01:05.440
we're not going to do a whole episode without him. Rather than-

01:05.440 --> 01:07.600
No, that would be pretty great.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.000
He's out of town, and rather than just leaving you all hanging,

01:10.000 --> 01:18.320
we wanted to put together another best of episode. This encompasses our 31st

01:19.200 --> 01:25.520
through our 45th episode, and there is so much good stuff. Bramblepelt, I think is in this one,

01:25.520 --> 01:31.120
Padula Kitten, Chin Deep and Chinchillas, all the classics.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.560
I don't remember any of those babies.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.640
I know. Well, just wait, you're going to hear about them.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.160
All of those were animal-based. Do we do a lot of animal-based humor on the show?

01:38.160 --> 01:41.440
All animal and penis-based humor in these early episodes, for sure.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.720
Okay, nice, nice.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.320
We wanted to mention, first off, we'll jump back in with you here in the middle,

01:48.320 --> 01:56.240
but we wanted to mention right up front, we're doing a live show in Los Angeles, California,

01:56.240 --> 02:02.240
and that's going to be on June 13th, 7.30 p.m. at the Downtown Independent Theater.

02:02.880 --> 02:08.480
Ticket sales are going to begin May 21st, that's this Wednesday, at 3 p.m. Eastern.

02:09.040 --> 02:15.760
That's noon Pacific, and you are not going to want to miss out because they are going to go

02:15.760 --> 02:19.120
fast. There's only going to be about 200 tickets available, and they will go fast because we're

02:19.120 --> 02:26.240
doing a show with Jordan Jesse Go, Double Bell, Explosion. It's going to be huge,

02:26.240 --> 02:30.640
and you are going to want to be there for it because it's going to be awesome.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.800
So, there's one show, and it goes on sale.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.320
And we cannot add more, people.

02:36.320 --> 02:46.160
We cannot add more. So, Wednesday at noon Eastern, and 3 p.m. Eastern, noon Pacific.

02:46.160 --> 02:52.960
3 p.m. Eastern, noon Pacific. And you can get those at mbmbam.brownpapertickets.com.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.800
mbmbam.brownpapertickets.com.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.440
Okay, time for highlights. We'll see you in a few.

02:59.440 --> 03:06.960
Like the Chilean miners emerging from the cre-

03:06.960 --> 03:07.760
You can't bust that out every week.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.360
Like Chilean miners.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.440
Is that a reboot? Is that what this is? Are we refreshing the franchise?

03:14.160 --> 03:17.280
This is just celebrating the hardworking miners of Chile.

03:17.280 --> 03:17.920
Of what?

03:17.920 --> 03:20.400
This isn't like about anything. I'm just glad that they're there.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.760
Oh, yeah. My screen breaks coming up, too. You want to maybe go to Chile?

03:25.760 --> 03:28.080
Maybe we could go chill on the beaches of Chile.

03:28.080 --> 03:34.480
It's like Chilean miners emerging from a mine. We've returned for another week of-

03:35.360 --> 03:38.720
You know, a lot of people, a lot of people liked that when I did it

03:38.720 --> 03:43.040
right after those famous guys came out. So I thought, what if I brought it back?

03:43.040 --> 03:45.920
I mean, Chilean miners are still coming out of mines.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.520
Sure, yeah. They haven't stopped, I hope.

03:49.520 --> 03:54.400
Right? I mean, they're going in there getting butane and gold.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.000
I don't know. They're getting butane?

03:58.000 --> 04:01.920
They go down there with just plastic shopping bags and they just scoop up the bute.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.600
Be open to receiving communications in varying ways.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.720
For example, your dream may be filled with a conversation with a dead person,

04:08.720 --> 04:11.280
or the dream may be filled with images, colors, or symbols.

04:12.240 --> 04:16.240
I had this dream where I ate a giant sandwich. What do you think Hitler was trying to tell me?

04:17.360 --> 04:20.720
It was very colorful, the sandwich, and symbolic in a way.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.760
Yeah. As an example, the dead person may say to you,

04:23.760 --> 04:26.960
I can't get through to your mother. She isn't picking up the phone.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.080
Let me try that again.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.000
Could you try her for me? Maybe send her a text.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.560
Let me try again. As an example, the dead person may say to you,

04:38.560 --> 04:46.240
I can't get through to your mother. She isn't picking up the phone.

04:46.240 --> 04:51.760
Obviously, there is no spirit phone, you dumb fuck.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.640
You dumb shit.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.760
Hey, dummy. But it's the dead person's way of saying

04:55.760 --> 05:00.000
that they're coming to you because the other person isn't open to communicating with the dead.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.040
And rather than say that, they brought up the complicated idea of a phone.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.880
Travis, listen. There's imagery, there's colors, and there's symbols.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.640
The spirit phone is a symbol.

05:10.640 --> 05:16.080
Your mom-moms don't talk to ghosts. Tell your mom to stop being such a prudish

05:16.080 --> 05:17.360
bitch. I'm trying to get your noodle.

05:17.360 --> 05:22.400
So, if I have a dream in which I'm in Pee Wee's Playhouse,

05:22.400 --> 05:26.960
and all of the talking furniture sounds like Charles Nelson Reilly, what's going on?

05:26.960 --> 05:30.240
Ghosts of Charles Nelson Reilly. Is he still alive?

05:30.240 --> 05:33.360
He's trapped in Paul Reuben's house. He's buried underneath Paul Reuben's house.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.440
Paul Reuben killed Charles Nelson Reilly. Buried him in the cellar.

05:38.480 --> 05:43.680
Now he makes the corpses of Charles Nelson Reilly watch him eat dinner.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.520
It's a really weird arrangement they have.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.640
Mystery solved.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.760
Mystery solved.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.960
It would have gotten away if it weren't for us meddling kids.

05:54.400 --> 05:59.680
This question was asked by Yahoo Answers user Nat Ilf, who asked,

06:00.400 --> 06:03.040
what is the heaviest babby to ever be birthed?

06:03.040 --> 06:03.920
Jesus.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.840
Really? Again with the babby?

06:05.840 --> 06:06.720
Again with the babby.

06:08.880 --> 06:09.680
Fucking cut it out.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.000
She goes on to ask,

06:12.000 --> 06:17.280
I am pregnant, due on Christmas, and the doctors say my babby is very heavy.

06:17.280 --> 06:21.040
I think they said he was going to be 175 pounds.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.040
Can I do anything to make my babby smaller?

06:27.040 --> 06:28.640
I am really worried about the labor.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.680
That's going to be a wicked labor.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.440
Wow.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.960
You will most certainly die.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.120
Your lower section will open up, it will bloom like a flower,

06:39.120 --> 06:44.800
when you pass that 175 pound man through your lady tubes.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.880
Let's be honest, this guy's wearing her like an inner tube right now.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.880
He's just walking around with his mom around his waist.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.200
Sure.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.360
It's vulgar.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.120
He's already applying for jobs.

06:57.120 --> 06:57.840
It's pretty awful.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.760
Is this like an early onset, early onset, like, Jack disease?

07:03.760 --> 07:04.880
Is that what's going on here?

07:04.880 --> 07:07.360
You think that job market is up right now.

07:07.360 --> 07:13.040
Now, try going in with your mom with her skin stretched out all around your hands and feet.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.280
I see a human face sticking out of your chest, like, through the skin.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.160
What is going on?

07:18.160 --> 07:19.280
We're both applying.

07:21.600 --> 07:26.000
You hire both of us, or you hire neither of us, unless it's a very compelling offer,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.120
and then I will consider a late-term abortion.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.560
Although, you know what?

07:30.560 --> 07:31.680
You know what, conservatives?

07:31.680 --> 07:34.000
That is one area where if you abort a full-grown man,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.720
I think I can get on board with you that that should be a crime.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.560
When does consent, when does life begin?

07:40.560 --> 07:45.520
I think once you have stubble, I think definitely life is officially begun.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.400
At six, yeah.

07:46.400 --> 07:46.960
Sure.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.000
Life begins at six feet.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.440
How bad, I don't even care about the miscommunication.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.720
Like, how bad have you been at weights, your whole life?

07:54.720 --> 07:58.960
You don't, like, that doesn't immediately, like, whoa, did you say 175?

07:59.760 --> 08:02.080
That sounds like a hefty person.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.320
You only weigh 130 pounds.

08:04.880 --> 08:09.280
You physically can't, unless your urethra is a TARDIS,

08:09.280 --> 08:12.880
there is literally no way that you could have that in you.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.440
It's like, no, it's like the genie bottle, you see.

08:15.440 --> 08:19.200
And I just said urethra as if that was some kind of body part

08:19.200 --> 08:21.840
that's involved in the passing of babies through humans.

08:21.840 --> 08:26.240
That is, in fact, the tube that a man's urine goes out, right?

08:26.960 --> 08:28.880
Ladies have them, don't ladies have them too?

08:28.880 --> 08:31.200
Like, I don't know, you may know a doctor.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.120
So the urethra is where your baby is.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.040
You're going to pee out that 175 pound baby through your urethra,

08:41.040 --> 08:42.720
and it's going to be the worst day of your life.

08:42.720 --> 08:42.960
Yeah.

08:42.960 --> 08:43.760
Enjoy that, elf.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.720
You're a dead woman.

08:46.080 --> 08:49.440
My boyfriend and I joke around and call each other by fun pet names,

08:49.440 --> 08:50.880
like chump and punk.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.800
What are some names I could call him,

08:54.800 --> 08:56.880
or what have you called boyfriends or girlfriends?

08:56.880 --> 08:59.200
I usually call my girlfriends chump or punk.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.760
So I'm fresh out of solutions.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.560
You could combine it and just call him Chunk.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.800
Yeah, or Pump.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.880
Sydney and Sidney, Sidney and Sidney, this is uncommon don't.

09:10.880 --> 09:11.440
Is that normal?

09:13.440 --> 09:14.240
Is that okay?

09:15.040 --> 09:16.160
This is my girlfriend.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.840
This is my girlfriend, Chunk Pump.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.160
I love her very much.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.280
She's very sweet.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.520
This is my girlfriend, the captain.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.120
I really love her very much.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.200
I really love her very much.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.320
She's a real sweetheart.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.760
Chunk Pump makes me think of like the old timey way

09:31.760 --> 09:34.480
that pioneers used to get creamed corn up out of the ground.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.480
Got a deep vein here.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.520
This is a nice vein.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.000
It's rich.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.680
Let me get out my creamed corn dowsing machine.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.520
It's made of creamed corn.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.680
Why wouldn't it be just like fossilized?

09:49.680 --> 09:52.320
I hold a scoop of creamed corn in my left hand,

09:52.320 --> 09:53.360
and it leads me home.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.120
Where are you going?

09:56.080 --> 10:00.400
I think we can find some elucidation

10:00.400 --> 10:02.640
in the answers that have been provided.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.160
Okay, that's good.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.520
Anastasia responded.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.520
Mr. Sweetsie Poo.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.800
Lovey Snookums.

10:10.800 --> 10:11.600
Cuddly Kints.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.320
Huggy Bear.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.280
Love Muffin.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.080
Snuggly Pie.

10:14.080 --> 10:14.880
Boo Boo Bear.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.000
Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.000
Hi, I'm Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.280
I'm Professor Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.640
I'm Bon Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

10:20.640 --> 10:24.480
The next thing is the best thing I've ever read.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.080
Badoodly Kitten.

10:28.080 --> 10:28.580
What?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.080
Say that one more time.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.080
Badoodly Kitten.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.280
Can I get one more?

10:35.280 --> 10:36.480
Just take me to the bridge.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.160
A Badoodly Kitten.

10:38.880 --> 10:43.920
That would be B-apostrophe-D-oodly Kitten.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.360
I didn't know that we could just like say sounds

10:47.360 --> 10:48.880
and like mash them together.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.680
Like, Raquantia.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.600
Like, Raquantia?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.760
Like, that's Badoodly Kitten.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.440
I sensed from this email that you guys love each other.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.240
I can tell that.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.760
I sense a love there.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.360
But it sounds like you guys are one good long conversation

11:05.360 --> 11:07.360
away from getting this sorted out.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.400
Sounds like a convo needs to take place.

11:14.080 --> 11:18.000
If it's not gonna work out, there's always Griffin.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.240
He's, I can give you his phone number.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.200
He's super nice.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.200
Please, ladies.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.200
Ripe for the picking.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.880
Like a delicious cherry.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.840
One might even say overripe.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.840
One might say he's developed some tendencies

11:33.840 --> 11:39.120
during his year of solitude that maybe are not so attractive.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.720
Maybe a few bruises on the fruit.

11:42.720 --> 11:49.440
Maybe my rind is a little moldy, figuratively and literally.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.200
Ladies are guys.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.280
Line forms to the left.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.120
Yeah, I'm not so picky anymore.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.160
Just anybody.

11:58.160 --> 11:58.880
Just take him.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.240
Yeah, I got one.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.880
I've been staring at it the whole show.

12:08.880 --> 12:13.360
It's like a deep dark pit, this question.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.880
I think we just got to dive into it,

12:14.880 --> 12:16.800
even though we don't know where it'll stop.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.160
It was sent in by Goodbye Babylon Babylon,

12:21.280 --> 12:23.920
which wasn't that a, is that a David Gray song?

12:24.880 --> 12:25.360
I don't know.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ruby Heart McKinley, who asks,

12:31.200 --> 12:33.280
what are some good warrior cat names?

12:34.800 --> 12:35.440
What?

12:35.440 --> 12:35.760
Excuse me?

12:35.760 --> 12:37.440
I need five warrior names.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.320
Three names for three black cats, one for a white cat,

12:40.320 --> 12:41.840
and one for a brown cat, please.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.400
I have no fucking idea what's going on with this question.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.080
There's no more details?

12:48.080 --> 12:48.480
That's it.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.680
Please tell me there's more details.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.400
Wait a minute.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.360
That's all we've got.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.680
Warrior cat names.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.400
Now, let me read you some of the answers.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.200
This one was sent in by Josie J. Feather McKaney,

13:01.200 --> 13:02.800
or rather it was answered.

13:02.800 --> 13:07.520
The answer was provided by Josie J. Feather Mulcainy, who-

13:07.520 --> 13:08.640
Hey, there's your first name.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.600
Name one, done.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.200
Who says, I love creating warrior names.

13:13.200 --> 13:13.920
Smiley face.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.840
Here's some for black cats.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.240
Yes!

13:20.960 --> 13:24.800
Nightshade, Nightriver, Nightfall, Nightfire, Nighthunter,

13:24.800 --> 13:28.560

Snowfall, Ice Wind, Frostbite, Frostpool, Snow Song.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.360
Here's some for brown cats.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.480
Thorn Prick, Cobra Strike, Snake Skin, Viper Fang,

13:52.480 --> 13:55.680
Adder Snack, Bramblesong, Bramblespring, Bramblesong,

13:55.680 --> 13:57.760
Thornwing, Fallen Snake, Snakebite.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.680
What about Calicas?

14:01.680 --> 14:02.480
You got a Calica?

14:05.600 --> 14:07.840
Hodgepodge, black and white, and orange.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.280
Silly, buddy.

14:10.160 --> 14:10.720
Mixed up.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.160
Oh, Jesus Christ.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.720
I mean, guys, there's a full page.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.520
There's a full page of people providing answers.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.400
Could you read the first name for the white cats again?

14:22.400 --> 14:23.120
The first name.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.640
No, I can't.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.080
There's so many that I can't repeat them.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.840
I'm almost certain it was Lilypad.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.440
Lilypad was one of them.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.920
That is not a scary warrior name.

14:31.920 --> 14:36.160
Hey, Griffin, do you have any ideas on warrior names for brown cats?

14:37.360 --> 14:39.120
Let's see what the other people have to say.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.160
Brown cat, Bramble Pelt, Sun Fern, Sand Dust, Sandy Pelt,

14:44.160 --> 14:48.640
Sandy Mist, Sand Pelt, Tabby Claw, Sand Claw,

14:48.640 --> 14:51.760
Sandy Claw, Dust Claw, Sparrow Flight, Autumn Flight,

14:51.760 --> 14:54.000
Trout Leap, Morning Dew, Mouth Fang.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.360
Trout Leap?

14:57.360 --> 14:58.160
Rose Whisker.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.680
Like, what the fuck?

15:01.680 --> 15:02.960
What is a warrior cat?

15:03.840 --> 15:06.160
This is why I am scared for humanity.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.160
Every answer to that question should have been,

15:08.160 --> 15:09.600
what the fuck are you talking about?

15:09.600 --> 15:10.560
Aurora Song.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.600
Like, what are we doing?

15:13.520 --> 15:17.920
This is this horrifying truth that we've unearthed with this show,

15:17.920 --> 15:20.320
is that there are whole other worlds.

15:20.320 --> 15:20.560
Yeah.

15:20.560 --> 15:25.440
Yeah, there are whole other things that don't connect to us.

15:25.440 --> 15:29.440
Like, we don't have any vines into them,

15:29.440 --> 15:31.520
reaching into them to give us some connection.

15:31.520 --> 15:35.440
It's a completely different planet that's just spinning wildly of its own accord.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.760
We have some wild misconceptions about the furry community

15:37.760 --> 15:42.400
that I feel like we now understand and totally accept into our hearts and collective minds.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.400
But what?

15:44.400 --> 15:45.200
Bramble Song.

15:45.840 --> 15:46.320
What?

15:46.320 --> 15:46.720
I mean-

15:46.720 --> 15:47.360
Bramble Pelt.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.400
Snowy Pelt.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.200
Bramble Pelt.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.720
What are we doing here?

15:50.720 --> 15:51.760
Child Jump.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.640
I'm not angry.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.320
I'm a little angry.

15:54.320 --> 15:54.720
I'm scared.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.080
I just want to know what's going on.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.840
Like, are people dressing up their cats in, like, tinfoil armor and, like,

15:59.840 --> 16:01.760
just, like, taking them outside and just yelling,

16:01.760 --> 16:02.480
Hidden Mist!

16:02.480 --> 16:03.760
Star Chaser!

16:03.760 --> 16:04.320
Like-

16:04.320 --> 16:04.560
Go!

16:06.880 --> 16:07.600
Here's what I want.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.640
I want to see this guy actually picks five warrior cat names

16:11.200 --> 16:14.960
and tries to get them to all follow him in the battle.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.040
Star Chaser.

16:17.040 --> 16:17.280
Go!

16:17.280 --> 16:18.400
Go!

16:18.400 --> 16:18.640
What?

16:19.840 --> 16:23.040
Bram- Bram- Bramble Sky, you're just licking your butt.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.680
This is not a warrior, like, attitude, thorn prick.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.400
Oh, God.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.560
Apparently you're having babies every year,

16:32.560 --> 16:34.800
so maybe with two wives you could alternate it

16:34.800 --> 16:36.320
and they could at least have a year off.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.040
Yeah, I know you're worried about your wife being worn out,

16:39.040 --> 16:40.320
and at this rate she will be.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.280
So I would say get a second wife to maybe carry one of the twins.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.000
Is that-

16:46.000 --> 16:47.040
Is that possible?

16:47.040 --> 16:47.920
A brood wife.

16:48.800 --> 16:49.120
Yes.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.680
Get yourself a brood wife.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.320
And then, like, one can be your society wife,

16:55.200 --> 16:59.920
and then one can be your, you know, your gestating hive queen.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.280
Hive-

17:03.280 --> 17:04.160
This is-

17:04.160 --> 17:06.880
This is, uh, this is my second wife, Crystal.

17:06.880 --> 17:07.360
Cris-

17:07.360 --> 17:08.000
Chrysalis.

17:08.000 --> 17:08.880
Chrysalis.

17:08.880 --> 17:09.920
Her name is Crystal.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.040
It's not Chrysalis.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.560
I don't know why I thought that.

17:12.560 --> 17:19.360
And her name is also not DX173pon, so I don't believe people saying that either.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.520
And I certainly have-

17:21.520 --> 17:24.160
I have never considered harvesting her jellies.

17:26.240 --> 17:31.040
For Valentine's Day, I got you a second wife in a tank of plasma,

17:31.040 --> 17:35.280
and we're just gonna use her to harvest organs and babies from.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.480
You're welcome.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.600
You're welcome.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.560
What did you get me?

17:38.560 --> 17:40.560
Oh, a Stone Temple pilot CD.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.560
Thank you.

17:44.400 --> 17:49.120
This one is, uh, this one's by yahoo answers user dragon101, who asks,

17:51.440 --> 17:52.320
I'm a dragon.

17:53.040 --> 17:53.360
Okay.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.480
But I don't know how to summon my special skills.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.960
I can do some things unordinary.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.000
Anyone have ideas?

18:01.520 --> 18:06.000
This is kind of new, uh, and also confusing for my age, that is.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.160
I can tell you right now that I'm under 21.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.520
Anyone have ideas on what I could do because I'm a dragon?

18:11.520 --> 18:12.080
Please?

18:13.200 --> 18:16.720
Well, this is the age old question of, is it a mental thing?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.640
Is there a muscle that you flex?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.480
Is there an incantation?

18:20.480 --> 18:22.720
It's age old questions, you know?

18:22.720 --> 18:24.880
And really, it's different strokes for different folks.

18:24.880 --> 18:29.840
Like for me, uh, for me, it's all muscular.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.720
Yeah.

18:30.720 --> 18:34.960
I've had to tone, um, I've had to develop.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.120
You've had to kegel?

18:37.120 --> 18:42.400
I've had to kegel my dragon muscles, um, to the, to the point where I can, um, you know,

18:42.400 --> 18:45.120
execute my, my unordinary abilities.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.320
But the thing is 21.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.120
That's a, that's kind of a, you're a little late to the game.

18:49.120 --> 18:49.760
You are.

18:49.760 --> 18:55.280
You're getting a late start to learning your, your dragon as in the old tongue, uh,

18:55.280 --> 18:56.560
Your draconic,

18:56.560 --> 18:58.720
Your draconic abilities.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.720
Cause I mean, that's a, that's a weird age.

19:00.720 --> 19:01.760
Dragon puberty.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.400
Like, um, I had mine in middle school.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.520
I was kind of an early bloomer.

19:05.520 --> 19:11.120
You know, some things just hit me in the third age, but it was a long time ago.

19:11.120 --> 19:11.680
Okay.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.080
Yeah.

19:12.080 --> 19:18.400
I'm, I just become, I just became so terrified because I just realized that dragons have

19:18.400 --> 19:22.320
learned to use the internet and we've lost our one vantage.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.360
The one thing we had that they didn't.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.600
I don't know how to break this to you, but one out of every four people you talk to or

19:29.600 --> 19:31.040
meet on the internet is a dragon.

19:32.320 --> 19:33.040
Holy shit.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.480
Holy shit.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.840
Is that a velociraptor noise?

19:36.720 --> 19:37.360
Travis.

19:37.360 --> 19:37.840
Oh shit.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.440
Travis is one of them.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.360
I didn't know this was a dragon cast.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.160
If dragons aren't using the internet, then explain TMZ.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.160
You can't, it can't be done.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.040
Fuck dragons.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.760
Made by, made by, gossip by dragons for dragons.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.120
Perez Hilton, half dragon.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.440
What does a dragon keyboard look like?

19:53.440 --> 19:54.720
Do you think it has runes?

19:54.720 --> 19:55.760
I think it has runes.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.880
I think it's very runic.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.640
I think it's made out of like loot.

19:58.640 --> 20:02.480
It's made out of what?

20:02.480 --> 20:04.640
It's got a loot, like dragon loot.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.320
Dragons have hoards, right?

20:06.320 --> 20:08.000
Just full of like jewels and gold.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.880
Travis, a loot.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.800
Oh, L-O-O-T, not L-U-T-E.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.040
You think you made it met several little stringed instruments?

20:15.040 --> 20:16.720
Like that's what his keyboard was made out of?

20:16.720 --> 20:18.160
I couldn't, I couldn't.

20:18.160 --> 20:18.960
Like Sting?

20:18.960 --> 20:20.320
Like Sting plays?

20:20.320 --> 20:20.560
Yes.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.560
Sting's a dragon?

20:24.240 --> 20:25.840
This one was sent in by Matt Warren.

20:25.840 --> 20:26.480
Thank you, Matt Warren.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Megan who asked,

20:28.160 --> 20:31.440
I need help naming my chinchilla breeding business.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.160
Hello, I am looking into breeding chinchillas,

20:34.160 --> 20:36.080
but I need a name for my company.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.000
I want it to be something elegant and pretty,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.960
and the last word needs to be chinchillas or exotics.

20:40.960 --> 20:44.480
I don't want anything that says Megan's or Ontario's, etc.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.760
I also don't want silly names like Jenny Chin Chin's.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.040
That's the best.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.480
That's the best one, though.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.800
It needs to sound sophisticated.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.240
For example, some names I like are Blue Moon Chinchillas,

20:56.240 --> 20:59.120
Blue Moon Exotics, Autumn Breeze Chinchillas,

20:59.120 --> 21:02.240
Autumn Breeze Exotics, White Rose Chinchillas,

21:02.240 --> 21:03.520
White Rose Exotics.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.680
If you need any other information, just ask.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.120
Also, if you want to add in some possible chinchilla names,

21:09.120 --> 21:10.080
I wouldn't mind.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.440
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

21:11.440 --> 21:12.080
Bramble Pelt.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.000
Thanks for everything, Megan.

21:16.000 --> 21:16.720
Storm Scream.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.680
Night Shadow.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.600
Can I suggest Fluffy Rats Exotics?

21:23.600 --> 21:27.680
Because that says what they are without it coming right out

21:27.680 --> 21:29.040
and saying chinchillas.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.720
Chinchillas have been on the nose.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.960
Can I suggest Chin Deep?

21:32.960 --> 21:34.560
Chin Deep.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.520
Now, it does have to end with chinchillas or exotics.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.640
Those are the rules.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.840
Chin Deep Exotics?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.040
Oh, that's not good.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.240
That's not a good...

21:42.240 --> 21:45.440
That doesn't work for me at a few levels.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.680
That sounds like a website that opens up when you're on

21:49.680 --> 21:55.200
another website you shouldn't be on accidentally.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.400
Ready to go chin deep?

21:57.760 --> 21:59.440
How did you get chin deep?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.680
Why is it that when someone started dumping exotics,

22:03.680 --> 22:05.440
when it got waist deep, you weren't like,

22:05.440 --> 22:08.720
ow, it didn't happen all at once?

22:09.280 --> 22:11.360
I am chin deep in exotics right now.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.840
That pit of exotics doesn't look so deep.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.840
I'm going to jump in and just see how it goes.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.680
I'm chin deep.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.760
What about speed rats?

22:19.760 --> 22:20.880
Speed rats.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.320
Because that's what chinchillas are.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.600
They're like rats, but they dart back and forth very quickly.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.280
Erotic exotics.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.480
Okay, now we're on to something.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.280
Yeah, that's good.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.960
It's got like a little flow to it.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.040
What about Mussolini's chinchillas?

22:37.840 --> 22:39.520
I mean, you want something classy.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.400
Something classy.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.520
How about Sacco chinchillas?

22:43.520 --> 22:44.960
Sacco chinchillas.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.680
And then your best thing is like you already have a gimmick.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.960
So like people come in, you're like,

22:49.600 --> 22:51.200
how about a Sacco chinchillas?

22:51.760 --> 22:53.840
And like they can pay extra for the grab bag

22:53.840 --> 22:55.840
and who knows what's in the grab bag.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.440
Spoiler alert, dead chinchillas.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.440
There's a good one.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.880
People come in like, hey, what the fuck, man?

23:04.880 --> 23:07.600
And you're like, no, no, no, they're very much alive.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.240
Would you like one?

23:09.200 --> 23:10.240
It's pronounced the odd.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.120
How about tiny shitty cats?

23:13.120 --> 23:15.920
Chinchillas, exotics.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.560
There's gotta be something.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.800
I think we've got a curiosity.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.480
Are there any answers on that question?

23:22.480 --> 23:23.920
Yeah, there's gotta be some, right?

23:23.920 --> 23:25.280
I mean, they're all, but they're all very,

23:27.840 --> 23:30.720
how about clueless money grubbers are us?

23:30.720 --> 23:32.080
That's a little mean.

23:32.080 --> 23:32.720
Excuse me?

23:33.440 --> 23:35.760
Breeding any animals, not a business or a company.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.360
They're not definitely a profit.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.680
I'm ruining things.

23:40.320 --> 23:40.960
Oh God.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.320
Oh God.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.640
Ragged Telecaster says, I don't know about names,

23:44.640 --> 23:46.720
but I'll breed with your chinchillas if you like.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.400
Oh no.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.240
Dude, what?

23:51.760 --> 23:52.720
What did you say to me?

23:54.080 --> 23:54.720
You'll breed.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.320
Here, do it on site and call it the worst thing

24:00.320 --> 24:01.840
you've ever seen chinchillas.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.920
The Island of Dr.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.320
Moreau chinchillas.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.240
A nightmare circus sideshow.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.760
Everything you've ever feared in your life, chinchillas.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.280
How about just chinchilla?

24:13.280 --> 24:14.160
Maybe want to die.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.840
How about loose and easy chinchillas?

24:21.040 --> 24:22.080
Madam chinchillas.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.120
Yahoo answers user Emerald a responded.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.480
I like autumn breeze exotics,

24:34.480 --> 24:40.480
but I am thinking chinny chinny chill la la chinchilla cool cats.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.800
Or chinchilla cc's for short.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.520
Chinchilla cc's what?

24:45.520 --> 24:47.120
It is good to start out the name with C

24:47.120 --> 24:48.960
because one of the first listed in directories.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.360
And how about chinny chilled out cats?

24:51.360 --> 24:52.160
Lol.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.560
What the fuck are you saying?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.320
Chinny chilled out cats?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.200
How about fun dip baseball disco dance?

24:59.200 --> 25:01.920
Like how about we just make a bunch of words

25:01.920 --> 25:04.000
that have nothing to do with the thing that she asked about?

25:05.040 --> 25:07.680
So he says you should pick something with a C

25:07.680 --> 25:09.440
because it's one of the first letters.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.440
Like you know the first one right dog?

25:13.840 --> 25:16.720
Yeah, maybe a few pages in the directory

25:16.720 --> 25:19.280
that precede chinny chilled out cats.

25:19.840 --> 25:20.720
You dumb fuck.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.000
To be fair, everyone knows everyone just skips right over A and B

25:24.000 --> 25:25.440
because those are for pussies.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.120
You got to go right into the C.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.560
That's where the meat of the matter is.

25:28.560 --> 25:32.240
Absolutely amazing chinny chin chin chilla cats.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.920
Aardvarks chin chinchillas.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.800
This is what you call your business.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.280
Aardvarks and chinchillas and not aardvarks.

25:43.360 --> 25:47.600
Aardvarks, chinchillas, and just kidding about the aardvark exotics.

25:48.240 --> 25:53.440
Just do a rebus with a picture of an aardvark plus chinchilla minus aardvark.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.600
Because everybody knows that in the film book rebuses come first.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.440
Go on in and watch a grown man fuck a chinchilla.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.160
The rebus for that is going to be a nightmare.

26:06.160 --> 26:09.120
Here at aardvarks, chinchillas, and not aardvarks.

26:09.920 --> 26:13.840
I came here to fuck aardvarks and chinchillas and we're fresh out of aardvarks.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.880
Would your parents explain sex if you put it in your Christmas wish list?

26:29.040 --> 26:31.760
Um, well, there's there's additional details,

26:31.760 --> 26:35.280
but I feel like we need to address the first question first.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.240
Would your parents explain sex if you put it in your Christmas wish list?

26:39.040 --> 26:42.560
It sounds like he's asking his parents never explained sex.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.600
I mean, that seems like a pretty important present.

26:46.160 --> 26:49.280
If they skipped out on that, that I don't know about you guys.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.720
I received a series of lectures.

26:51.680 --> 26:55.040
Yeah, I think it's funny that he has to outsmart his parents about it.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.680
Like, oh, you got me.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.480
All right.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.840
I guess you got to have the talk now.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.200
You did put it on your list.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.240
Good call.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.600
Uh, does, is this question asker wanting this information?

27:05.600 --> 27:07.280
Like, are they in need of this?

27:07.280 --> 27:10.640
Like, they know how to ask Yahoo to ask their parents?

27:10.640 --> 27:12.480
Let me, let me bust out the additional details.

27:13.040 --> 27:13.540
Okay.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.640
I'm 20 and still awful at it.

27:18.000 --> 27:18.960
Oh no.

27:18.960 --> 27:25.920
Now that, now we just broke through the crust into the creepy, creepy mantle of this question.

27:27.920 --> 27:31.360
Wow, uh, so you are wanting sex tips.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.360
Oh no.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.760
You want to, you want, you want to go to your mom and dad and say, hey, mom and dad, teach me how to dougie.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.760
Like, is that what you're saying?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.760
I mean, he is saying something like that.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.760
I'm still terrible at it.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.760
I need mom and dad to teach.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.760
Hey, daddy.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.760
Um, daddy, my daddy, I love you.

27:49.760 --> 27:49.760
Happy Christmas.

27:49.760 --> 27:49.760
Happy Christmas.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.760
Papa.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.760
Um, do you enjoy your bowling ball?

27:53.760 --> 27:55.760
Good.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.760
Uh, I'm trying to rearrange some guts and I could,

27:59.760 --> 28:01.760
I could use some pro tips, daddy.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.760
Yeah.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.760
Uh, happy birthday, uh, Jesus.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.760
And I know it's Jesus' birthday.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.760
Nothing's as a family get together, like sex tips.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.760
And everything, but I'm getting laughed at over here.

28:13.760 --> 28:19.760
Um, I'm getting some, I'm getting some coital giggles that I could really do without.

28:19.760 --> 28:25.760
So if you have like a strategy guide that I could crack the spine of.

28:25.760 --> 28:33.760
Hey, daddy, after Rudolph, could you jot me down some charts and maybe some diagrams?

28:33.760 --> 28:39.760
Just jot me out, like a Venn diagram of what to do and where to do it.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.760
Yeah.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.760
How to do it.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.760
How you do.

28:45.760 --> 28:49.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user PoeticBBQ.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.760
All right.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.760
Uh, who asks?

28:53.760 --> 28:55.760
Valentine's Day gift for my cougar?

28:55.760 --> 28:59.760
I'm seeing an older woman, me 30, her 43,

28:59.760 --> 29:03.760
and want to send her an awesome gift for Valentine's Day because I'm gone working on the road.

29:03.760 --> 29:09.760
We've been seeing each other for a couple months and the coitus is pretty amazing.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.760
Oh, good.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.760
And want to get her something that is classy, but not overbearing.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.760
Any ideas?

29:15.760 --> 29:19.760
Hey, Greg's mom, that coitus was really outstanding.

29:19.760 --> 29:23.760
I don't want to put this in the creepiest way imaginable,

29:23.760 --> 29:27.760
but that coitus felt really good on my genitals.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.760
What are you saying? That's so gross.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.760
I know the perfect gift.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.760
Stop calling it coitus.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.760
Can we?

29:35.760 --> 29:47.760
Is it possible that he's referring to an older female literal cougar?

29:47.760 --> 29:49.760
It could be.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.760
There's some raw meat.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.760
I mean, why do you get a jungle cat?

29:53.760 --> 30:03.760
Maybe you should just make a commitment to take care of the horrible bispecies baby you created with all your coitus.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.760
During your coitus.

30:05.760 --> 30:11.760
Listen, Deborah Cat, when you have our terrible, terrible cougar man, I will take care of him.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.760
I will raise him as my own.

30:13.760 --> 30:17.760
I will raise him in public schools because he will consume the other children.

30:17.760 --> 30:23.760
This is like the fifth episode in a row where we've had to talk about half-human, half-animal hybrids.

30:23.760 --> 30:29.760
This is a very, very bestial podcast, and I'm not comfortable with it.

30:29.760 --> 30:33.760
Goose Man, that's what happened 20 episodes ago.

30:33.760 --> 30:37.760
Oh, man, what if Goose Man and Cougar Man got together?

30:37.760 --> 30:39.760
I'd watch that show.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.760
William H. Macy.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.760
As everyone in the show.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.760
Everyone in Cougar Man and Goose Man.

30:47.760 --> 30:51.760
I will watch it.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.760
Oh, John Lithgow.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.760
What a great coup for Penguin Man.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.760
My name is Mike, and my wife's name is Darlene.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.760
She's made of Snuggies.

31:03.760 --> 31:07.760
Her parents are also Mike and Darlene, and her brother's name, Mike.

31:07.760 --> 31:15.760
Wait for it. She wants to name our kids Mike and Darlene, but I think it's a bad idea.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.760
Am I overreacting?

31:17.760 --> 31:19.760
He didn't sign it, but I'm gonna guess it's Mike.

31:19.760 --> 31:23.760
That's a wicked bad idea.

31:23.760 --> 31:27.760
His full name is Mike Mike Darlene.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.760
I'm Darlene Micerson.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.760
The third.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.760
This is my brother, Mike.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.760
His sister, Darlene.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.760
My dog, Mark Darlene.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.760
It's hard, family reunions.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.760
Somebody says Mike and the whole house just burns down.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.760
What? Who? What?

31:45.760 --> 31:51.760
What if every Mike you've ever known is up in the mix, up in this family?

31:51.760 --> 31:55.760
What if this is some sort of, I don't know, some sort of legacy?

31:55.760 --> 31:57.760
Or a cult.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.760
Griffin, listen.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.760
I know this is weird to say at this time.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.760
It's the holidays and everything, but I have to tell you something.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.760
Okay.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.760
I saw Mike making out with Darlene.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.760
No.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.760
No.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.760
That's either incest or adultery.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.760
No, I saw Mike making out with Darlene.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.760
Don't do that.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.760
Don't do that.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.760
What are you overreacting?

32:23.760 --> 32:27.760
You are underreacting if you're taking the time to write to us instead of filing divorce proceedings.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.760
What?

32:29.760 --> 32:31.760
What is your name?

32:31.760 --> 32:33.760
There's no way that that conversation doesn't go like this.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.760
Fuck it. Let's just call him Mike and Darlene.

32:36.760 --> 32:40.760
Like, there's no way it was like a coincidence that you came up with those names.

32:40.760 --> 32:46.760
It's so much deeper than this because you're assuming that everybody in this situation had a choice of what the next generation of people's names are going to be, right?

32:46.760 --> 32:50.760
So Mike and Darlene are either the parents of Mike or Darlene,

32:50.760 --> 32:56.760
but whoever that child was had to go out in the world and find another person named Mike and Darlene that they can marry.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.760
Like, they're getting a fucking name monopoly.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.760
Yeah.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.760
Do you want to see what I'm saying?

33:03.760 --> 33:05.760
Yeah, I've played it.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.760
No, listen, guys.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.760
This is bad, Mike.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.760
If we can call you Mike.

33:11.760 --> 33:15.760
Why don't you suggest naming the boy Darlene and the girl Mike?

33:15.760 --> 33:17.760
I'd love it.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.760
Tell her that's the only condition under which you'll accept it.

33:19.760 --> 33:23.760
Mike is M-Y-K-E.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.760
E.

33:25.760 --> 33:29.760
And Darlene, you spell M-I-K-E.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.760
It's pronounced Darlene.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.760
It's pronounced Darlene.

33:33.760 --> 33:37.760
There's a silent Mike and an invisible Darlene in there.

33:37.760 --> 33:43.760
You know, silent Mike and invisible Darlene are my favorite new rap duo of 2010.

33:43.760 --> 33:49.760
Did you hear their new album? It was an EP. It was a very limited release, but it was really good.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.760
You could only buy it if your name was Mike or Darlene.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.760
Don't prepare food in the bathtub.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.760
It's like you guys have never given a public service announcement before.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.760
It's like playing poker with my sister's kids.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.760
Do you want me to do one?

34:01.760 --> 34:03.760
Let me do one.

34:03.760 --> 34:07.760
A hundred people every year get sucked down the drain.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.760
They fucking look sharp.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.760
See? That's all you needed.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.760
They can play that. They can syndicate that on the radio.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.760
Do you want to try again?

34:17.760 --> 34:19.760
Yeah, let me try.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.760
So this would be like free publicity for us, right?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.760
Yeah, totally.

34:23.760 --> 34:27.760
In fact, if you even want to say like our names or like the name of the show.

34:27.760 --> 34:31.760
All right. I want to try one.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.760
I don't have a good one.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.760
God damn it, Justin.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.760
I'm sorry. I thought I had it.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.760
This is so difficult.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.760
Six people just died in the bath because of you.

34:41.760 --> 34:45.760
Yeah, they fell asleep because of how boring and awful you are.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
All right, here we go.

34:47.760 --> 34:51.760
If your fingers are pruney, that means it's the sin coming out.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.760
Ask Jesus. I love you.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.760
My brother, my brother.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.760
What?

34:57.760 --> 34:59.760
That's brilliant.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.760
You've just saved some lives.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.760
That's good because it's got a religious message.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.760
But also my people that earthly love is real and it's mine.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.760
How about this?

35:11.760 --> 35:13.760
How about this?

35:13.760 --> 35:19.760
The temperature of your water shouldn't exceed 115 degrees or else it'll flake the flesh off of your bones.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.760
And your baby's bones.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.760
My brother, my brother and me.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.760
Hey, hey, hey.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.760
Don't jerk off in the bathtub.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.760
That's awful.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.760
My brother, my brother and me.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.760
That washes down the drain and goes and mixes with everybody's water.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.760
And then you get somebody pregnant and have to pay child support.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.760
My brother, my brother and me.

35:39.760 --> 35:47.760
The water you're in right now is like 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 percent cum.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.760
Have a good bath.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.760
You'll never be clean again.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.760
My brother, my brother and me.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.760
Good.

35:55.760 --> 36:07.760

37:37.760 --> 37:39.760
I'm bored. I was hungry.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.760
Now I'm bored.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.760
I'm really a fuzzy baby today.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.760
Clip shows made me so fuzzy.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.760
So fussy.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.760
Travis, help me.

37:47.760 --> 37:48.760
Entertain me.

37:48.760 --> 37:57.760
I mean, you could do what we've literally talked about a hundred times in the last couple of months and go to Huluplus.com.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.760
How many of you are not Huluplus members?

38:00.760 --> 38:02.760
What is wrong with you?

38:02.760 --> 38:07.760
Do you do you live in some kind of a spider hole cave type thing?

38:07.760 --> 38:10.760
Don't you want to watch The Prophet?

38:10.760 --> 38:12.760
Don't you want to watch Grim?

38:12.760 --> 38:15.760
Don't you want to watch Saturday Night Live clips?

38:15.760 --> 38:16.760
Don't you want to?

38:16.760 --> 38:20.760
I mean, like it's all on there waiting for you.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.760
Now you're just doing it to be spiteful.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.760
You're just doing it to hurt me.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.760
Huluplus.com is amazing.

38:43.760 --> 38:48.760
There's a new show called Deadbeat about a comedy about a pot smoking guy that talks to ghosts.

38:48.760 --> 38:49.760
That's just there.

You're welcome.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.760
You can just watch it.

38:52.760 --> 38:53.760
Why do you have to hurt me like this?

38:53.760 --> 38:55.760
You're killing me.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.760
Okay, you don't want to pay for it.

38:56.760 --> 38:57.760
Oh, that's fine.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.760
This is still America.

38:58.760 --> 39:06.760
We do still have to pay for things, except we can get you a month for $8 normally.

39:06.760 --> 39:07.760
That's normal.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.760
$8 a month.

39:08.760 --> 39:09.760
But we're going to get you two weeks free.

39:09.760 --> 39:10.760
Yeah, no problem.

39:10.760 --> 39:11.760
No big deal.

39:11.760 --> 39:18.760
Go to Huluplus.com slash my brother and you'll get two weeks full access to Huluplus and it's completely free.

39:18.760 --> 39:19.760
Are you joking?

39:19.760 --> 39:20.760
This is what I picture.

39:20.760 --> 39:21.760
People are going to do that.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.760
Do the two week thing.

39:22.760 --> 39:23.760
I'm going to hop on for two weeks.

39:23.760 --> 39:27.760
I'm going to watch all of it in two weeks and then I'm going to dip out.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.760
But here's what you're going to find, people.

39:29.760 --> 39:30.760
You can't.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.760
There's way too much and you have to sleep or you'll die.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.760
And so you're going to watch it and go, well, I can't.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.760
I can't stop now.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.760
I just have to stay on Huluplus forever because it's such an amazing deal and all the shows are here.

39:40.760 --> 39:41.760
Go, people.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.760

39:42.760 --> 39:44.760
I feel like this has been the most sales pitchy we've ever been.

39:44.760 --> 39:45.760
It's wonderful.

39:45.760 --> 39:46.760
I love it so much.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.760

40:16.760 --> 40:22.760

And they talk about all kinds of like really wonderful how we create, why we create.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.760
And not only that, it's interactive.

40:29.760 --> 40:30.760
There's illustrations.

40:30.760 --> 40:35.760
There's work by other creative people and concepts from artists, philosophers and authors.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.760
It's really an amazing, amazing idea.

40:38.760 --> 40:45.760
Yeah, it's awesome just to look at the web page about the thing and to imagine how good the thing is.

40:45.760 --> 40:46.760
You should get it right now.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.760
That's at makingthingsbeautiful.net.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.760
That sounds like a deal.

41:09.760 --> 41:10.760
It is a deal.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.760
We're full of deals today.

41:12.760 --> 41:17.760
Yeah, we're just tossing out bargains like it's a parade of bargains.

41:17.760 --> 41:22.760
That's all of our sponsors for this week.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.760
Thank you so much to all of them for supporting us.

41:24.760 --> 41:28.760
And now we're going to get back to the jokes, the old jokes.

41:28.760 --> 41:29.760
The yucks.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.760
The yucks.

41:30.760 --> 41:31.760
Enjoy.

41:31.760 --> 41:36.760
Do you want to eat or snort or somehow imbibe this PCP?

41:36.760 --> 41:39.760
Sorry, guys.

41:39.760 --> 41:40.760
PCP?

41:40.760 --> 41:42.760
Bad for me.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.760
Do you want to help me drink this empty squeeze it bottle of PCP?

41:45.760 --> 41:48.760
That's what they keep them in.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.760
They melt the top of the lighter.

41:50.760 --> 41:54.760
They drink to squeeze it, then they melt the top of the lighter.

41:54.760 --> 41:59.760
That's why it's so popular as a drug is because there's so much impetus to squeeze it.

41:59.760 --> 42:04.760
Who are these people that are constantly having to turn down drugs?

42:04.760 --> 42:07.760
And why can't they just say no?

42:07.760 --> 42:10.760
Is the dealer going to be like, that wasn't creative enough.

42:10.760 --> 42:11.760
Take this.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.760
Try again.

42:14.760 --> 42:15.760
I need to feel it.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.760
I need to feel that you really don't want my drugs that I bought.

42:18.760 --> 42:24.760
If only you had rhymed, I wouldn't be shoving this PCP in your mouth and eyes.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.760
Or possibly ears or nose.

42:26.760 --> 42:27.760
Or ears or nose.

42:27.760 --> 42:28.760
Perhaps butthole.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.760
I don't know how it's distributed.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.760
I don't know about PCP very well.

42:33.760 --> 42:34.760
Angel dust, Griffin.

42:34.760 --> 42:35.760
Angel dust.

42:35.760 --> 42:36.760
Is that what it is?

42:36.760 --> 42:37.760
Yeah.

42:37.760 --> 42:38.760
Yeah.

42:38.760 --> 42:39.760
You know, angel dust.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.760
That actually sounds kind of nice.

42:42.760 --> 42:52.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user? who asks, I need to perform a colonoscopy to myself.

42:52.760 --> 42:58.760
I need a colonoscopy performed on me but unfortunately in these economic times I cannot afford a doctor.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.760
I'm pretty sure I can do it myself.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.760
But what should I get to perform?

43:03.760 --> 43:08.760
The only store near me is a Home Depot so the tools need to be from there.

43:08.760 --> 43:09.760
What items should I get?

43:09.760 --> 43:13.760
I have a very low budget so don't pick anything too expensive.

43:13.760 --> 43:17.760
You're kind of tying our hands.

43:17.760 --> 43:24.760
I want a homemade colonoscopy but I got maybe like eight bucks that I can drop on this.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.760
I found it in a wallet at Camden Park.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.760
I found it in a wallet at Camden Park and now I'm going to spend on a butt camera.

43:28.760 --> 43:29.760
Can you help?

43:29.760 --> 43:38.760
Now, I can't imagine the kind of yoga one has to go into to operate a self butt camera.

43:38.760 --> 43:42.760
The tech required is outrageous.

43:42.760 --> 43:52.760
I would say the smallest camera that I own is my iPhone 4 and even that is going to be, if you'll forgive the term, a stretch.

43:52.760 --> 44:00.760
The thing that bothers me is not just that he doesn't just want to do a home one, he wants to do a home one on the cheap.

44:00.760 --> 44:07.760
You can't say, you're already cutting the biggest corner, there are no other corners to cut.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.760
It's like oblong now.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.760
You can no longer cut corners, you're out of them.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.760
I'm all about pioneer spirit.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.760
I'm all about DIY.

44:15.760 --> 44:20.760
I'm all about looking up shit on the internet and then doing that shit without getting help from other people.

44:20.760 --> 44:26.760
But this is a bridge too far, dawg.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.760
Yeah, it is.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.760
I love value.

44:30.760 --> 44:34.760
Everybody who knows me, they say, Justin Bargenhauer, that's what everybody calls me.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.760
This is too much, you've gone too far.

44:36.760 --> 44:41.760
Nine months ago before we started doing this show, I would have thought this was a joke.

44:41.760 --> 44:46.760
But reading the answers, it's a real concern.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.760
Yeah, it's a real concern.

44:48.760 --> 44:52.760
Take a flexible hollow half inch diameter flex hose about two or three feet long.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.760
Stop it.

44:54.760 --> 44:57.760
Take a webcam housing off around the lens and circuit board.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.760
Run a cable attached to webcam lens and circuit board through the hose.

45:00.760 --> 45:04.760
Insert circuit board into flex hose and mount camera lens even with the tip of a hose.

45:04.760 --> 45:08.760
Grind a flashlight lens down into the diameter of the hose.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.760
No!

45:10.760 --> 45:14.760
Plug your computer in and turn the webcam on.

45:14.760 --> 45:16.760
Ram the device up your ass.

45:16.760 --> 45:21.760
Step six, kill cell.

45:21.760 --> 45:27.760
Can I make a humble suggestion of maybe sell your fucking computer and get a colonoscopy?

45:27.760 --> 45:30.760
Like as long as we're leaking outside the box.

45:30.760 --> 45:35.760
Can we start a fundraising drive to get this dude to a colonoscopist?

45:35.760 --> 45:37.760
Why is that the plan?

45:37.760 --> 45:41.760
How about what are some ways I can get some more money?

45:41.760 --> 45:49.760
I guarantee if you went to any doctor and said, I'm thinking about giving myself a self colonoscopy unless you do it for free.

45:49.760 --> 45:52.760
The doctor will do it for free.

45:52.760 --> 45:58.760
I'm going to hurt myself in my butt really bad if you do not come and give me a hand here.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.760
I'm going to give it to you straight, doc.

46:00.760 --> 46:08.760
You can either A, give me a free colonoscopy or B, dig a homemade colonoscopy camera out of my butt hole in two hours.

46:08.760 --> 46:09.760
You decide.

46:09.760 --> 46:14.760
This is how we're going to get health care pushed through Congress.

46:14.760 --> 46:24.760
Everybody calls their local representative and says, hey, I'm about to irreversibly damage my rectal wall if you do not get this shit approved.

46:24.760 --> 46:25.760
Hey, Obama.

46:25.760 --> 46:26.760
Hey, Obama.

46:26.760 --> 46:28.760
I'm going to hurt myself.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.760
This one's on you, bro.

46:30.760 --> 46:34.760
Yes, we can stick a webcam up our assholes.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.760
Good news, I appear to be cancer free.

46:36.760 --> 46:39.760
Bad news, I'm never not defecating.

46:39.760 --> 46:42.760
Anytime you see me, basically.

46:42.760 --> 46:47.760
I broke whatever flange or cap is supposed to be there.

46:47.760 --> 46:55.760
I would like to believe enough in humanity that it's not that every woman is instantly attracted to a guy because he is married.

46:55.760 --> 46:58.760
But I think it's more that you become more comfortable.

46:58.760 --> 47:00.760
You're not trying to impress anyone.

47:00.760 --> 47:04.760
I mean, you've already got, you know, your significant other, so you're not working at it.

47:04.760 --> 47:07.760
Which instantly makes you more attractive.

47:07.760 --> 47:08.760
So true.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.760
That's 100 percent brain married.

47:10.760 --> 47:11.760
That's what I call it.

47:11.760 --> 47:12.760
You got to be brain married.

47:12.760 --> 47:13.760
I like that.

47:13.760 --> 47:14.760
I like that a lot.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.760
How do you how deep does that that inception go, though?

47:16.760 --> 47:22.760
Like, I mean, I need obviously a name for my brain wife, right?

47:22.760 --> 47:28.760
I would need a name and like a story of how we met, how I met your brain mother.

47:28.760 --> 47:36.760
I'm saying I can I can invent an entire scenario around a person and then not let anybody know about it except for me.

47:36.760 --> 47:37.760
I can do that.

47:37.760 --> 47:38.760
Like, I've played Dungeons and Dragons.

47:38.760 --> 47:43.760
I'm totally capable of suspending entire, you know, worlds in my mind's eye.

47:43.760 --> 47:44.760
It's ironic.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.760
Those two skills dovetail so nicely.

47:48.760 --> 47:54.760
Because I know that when I'm trying to stop impressing women, the first thing I do is talk about Dungeons and Dragons.

47:54.760 --> 47:55.760
Hi.

47:55.760 --> 47:59.760
And that and you know what, a lot of people try to keep this their brain wife secret.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.760
I say open with it.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.760
I say, hi, my name is Griffin.

48:03.760 --> 48:07.760
I have an imaginary wife and a great skill at playing Dungeons and Dragons.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.760
Would you like to dance with me?

48:10.760 --> 48:12.760
And you know something?

48:12.760 --> 48:15.760
My favorite December's album is The Brain Wife.

48:15.760 --> 48:21.760
So I just wanted to I thought I'd kill that conversation.

48:21.760 --> 48:26.760
What is the best way to greet a girl when you first meet her? Is shaking hands awkward?

48:26.760 --> 48:28.760
Is it appropriate to give a sideways hug?

48:28.760 --> 48:29.760
Context.

48:29.760 --> 48:32.760
Perhaps like on a first date or a blind date.

48:32.760 --> 48:38.760
Recently, my grandmother hooked me up with a date with this girl she met during a Zumba class.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.760
What is that?

48:40.760 --> 48:42.760
Zumba, you know, Zumba.

48:42.760 --> 48:43.760
Zumba, Zumba.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.760
Go on.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.760
Yeah, it's like it's like Brazilian yoga or something.

48:46.760 --> 48:48.760
What's your grandmother doing there?

48:48.760 --> 48:49.760
I don't know.

48:49.760 --> 48:54.760
I talked to the girl on Facebook and she was very much interested in meeting up with me to go on a date.

48:54.760 --> 48:59.760
How do I greet her in such a way as to give a good lasting impression that will set the tone for the rest of the day?

48:59.760 --> 49:00.760
God, that's tough.

49:00.760 --> 49:03.760
If you shake hands, you're setting a weird tone.

49:03.760 --> 49:04.760
Yeah, don't shake hands.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.760
And definitely don't side hug.

49:06.760 --> 49:07.760
You're damned.

49:07.760 --> 49:08.760
Here's what you can.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.760
All right.

49:09.760 --> 49:12.760
I'm going to list off all the things you absolutely cannot do.

49:12.760 --> 49:13.760
Okay, hit me.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.760
Don't do nothing.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.760
Don't shake her hand.

49:16.760 --> 49:17.760
That's a bad tone.

49:17.760 --> 49:18.760
Don't hug her.

49:18.760 --> 49:20.760
Don't kiss her.

49:20.760 --> 49:21.760
Don't.

49:21.760 --> 49:22.760
No high fives.

49:22.760 --> 49:23.760
No high fives.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.760
No physical contact whatsoever.

49:25.760 --> 49:27.760
So don't not touch her, but don't touch her.

49:27.760 --> 49:28.760
Whatever you do.

49:28.760 --> 49:29.760
Yeah.

49:29.760 --> 49:30.760
Don't do nothing.

49:30.760 --> 49:31.760
Chest bump.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.760
What about a chest bump?

49:32.760 --> 49:33.760
That's touch.

49:33.760 --> 49:34.760
Don't do that.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.760
There's some sensitive stuff up on the top.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.760
What about just the first time you meet her?

49:38.760 --> 49:40.760
Just slow dance with her.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.760
Oh, that's good.

49:41.760 --> 49:42.760
You know what you should do?

49:42.760 --> 49:43.760
Zumba her.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.760
Just Zumba all over.

49:45.760 --> 49:49.760
You know, if you do go in for a chest bump, that's a pretty clear message about what kind

49:49.760 --> 49:50.760
of night the girl's going to have.

49:50.760 --> 49:51.760
Yeah.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.760
She's like, this is going to be terrible for both of us.

49:53.760 --> 49:54.760
Give it.

49:54.760 --> 49:57.760
Essentially, if you stand across the way, just slap your chest and go, hey, bra, chest

49:57.760 --> 49:58.760
bump.

49:58.760 --> 49:59.760
Here it comes.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
Chest bump.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.760
Bra, chest bump.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.760
I'm going to burst those.

50:02.760 --> 50:03.760
You're going to have a bad night.

50:03.760 --> 50:04.760
I'm not paying.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.760
I didn't bring any money.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.760
I stole your wallet when I chest bumped you.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.760
You're paying, I guess, by extension.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.760
So don't do any of those things.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.760
Don't do anything, but don't do nothing.

50:16.760 --> 50:19.760
Why don't we bring back kissing her hand?

50:19.760 --> 50:20.760
Oh, God.

50:20.760 --> 50:21.760
No.

50:21.760 --> 50:22.760
Drop to one day, kiss her hand.

50:22.760 --> 50:23.760
Yeah.

50:23.760 --> 50:29.760
Make sure you're wearing a fedora and make sure you're within eyesight of me so I can

50:29.760 --> 50:31.760
come kick the shit out of you.

50:31.760 --> 50:32.760
Yeah.

50:32.760 --> 50:33.760
Dullard.

50:33.760 --> 50:34.760
What about pinky swear?

50:34.760 --> 50:37.760
How do pinky swear that we're going to be in love?

50:37.760 --> 50:44.760
Hey, maybe this is the kind of thing that you should decide with her ahead of time on

50:44.760 --> 50:45.760
Facebook.

50:45.760 --> 50:46.760
When I see you, what is the proper-

50:46.760 --> 50:47.760
How should I touch you?

50:47.760 --> 50:48.760
You know, you're wondering-

50:48.760 --> 50:49.760
Tell me how to touch you.

50:49.760 --> 50:52.760
God damn it.

50:52.760 --> 50:56.760
I want to touch you right when we first meet.

50:56.760 --> 50:59.760
You know you're wondering about the right moment to say I love you.

50:59.760 --> 51:00.760
You found it.

51:00.760 --> 51:01.760
That's right.

51:01.760 --> 51:02.760
This is it right here.

51:02.760 --> 51:03.760
She won't think about what you're doing with your hands.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.760
I think you want to touch me too.

51:05.760 --> 51:06.760
Yeah.

51:06.760 --> 51:07.760
I think you would like to touch me.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.240
I think I would like to touch you.

51:09.240 --> 51:10.360
We don't know each other well.

51:10.360 --> 51:13.600
I want to make sure when I touch you- No, listen.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.440
I can't stress this enough.

51:15.440 --> 51:19.760
You really have to type this whole paragraph before you send it because if you send this

51:19.760 --> 51:22.760
piecemeal, there's a good chance you're going to lose her mid-stream.

51:22.760 --> 51:26.720
She's going to see the whole thought, see it through to the end because if you just

51:26.720 --> 51:31.080
open with I want to touch you, you can't get her to slow down.

51:31.080 --> 51:35.880
Just send her an email that says could you wear clothing with brightly marked areas where

51:35.880 --> 51:37.560
it's okay for me to touch you.

51:37.560 --> 51:38.560
Just a circle here.

51:38.560 --> 51:42.400
Can you wear a hyper-colored t-shirt when you touch me?

51:42.400 --> 51:43.400
Oh, fuck.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.400
Shit.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.760
You should probably just not go on the date.

51:45.760 --> 51:49.000
You should probably just stay home and just- I just can't eat it for you.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.640
Not in the bathtub.

51:50.640 --> 51:58.640
This is by Yahoo Answers user Dearest Love who asks, friend might be a robot, help?

51:58.640 --> 51:59.960
Okay.

51:59.960 --> 52:03.240
So my best friend of 15 years might be a robot.

52:03.240 --> 52:06.780
She beeps and boops and has a crazy phobia of water.

52:06.780 --> 52:10.200
And sometimes she spazzes out like a machine overheating.

52:10.200 --> 52:15.040
Should I confront her and be like, I think you might be a robot or leave it alone.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.240
Help.

52:16.240 --> 52:20.960
Now listen, straight up, everyone's immediate reaction is going to be to mock this person?

52:20.960 --> 52:22.520
No, no, no.

52:22.520 --> 52:23.520
Yeah.

52:23.520 --> 52:24.760
What the fuck?

52:24.760 --> 52:25.760
What if?

52:25.760 --> 52:26.760
It's an epidemic.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.840
Yeah.

52:27.840 --> 52:28.840
This is what I'm saying.

52:28.840 --> 52:33.080
If we don't listen to these people, we are losing our first line of defense.

52:33.080 --> 52:36.360
This is how they get us.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.160
Yeah.

52:38.160 --> 52:45.000
When you, when someone someday has a friend who is secretly a robot, when they come and

52:45.000 --> 52:50.160
they will, there's going to be at least one, it has to start somewhere.

52:50.160 --> 52:51.160
That's what I'm saying.

52:51.160 --> 52:52.160
Right?

52:52.160 --> 52:53.240
Like there has to be a first.

52:53.240 --> 52:57.000
And everyone thinks it's going to be Will Smith who's going to be that person who flips

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
it.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Yeah.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
But I think it's going to be people like you and me and Dearest Love.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Yeah.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.480
But here's, here's, let's, let's get the conversation started.

53:04.480 --> 53:10.720
Here's a response by Yahoo Answers user James who says, splash her with water and be like,

53:10.720 --> 53:12.820
oh sorry, I thought you were a robot.

53:12.820 --> 53:17.960
If she dies, she was a robot.

53:17.960 --> 53:18.960
Okay.

53:18.960 --> 53:19.960
Fundamental problem right here.

53:19.960 --> 53:21.800
People aren't using their fucking noodle.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.960
If she's a witch, she'll die too.

53:23.960 --> 53:24.960
You don't.

53:24.960 --> 53:25.960
Yeah.

53:25.960 --> 53:26.960
Think about that.

53:26.960 --> 53:27.960
What's up?

53:27.960 --> 53:28.960
Mind freak.

53:28.960 --> 53:35.560
I think that that preferred response here is to close her off in a room with no access

53:35.560 --> 53:40.040
to electricity or food or water for two weeks or three weeks.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.040
Yep.

53:41.040 --> 53:46.880
And then if she is able to, if she like dies without electricity, robot or food or water,

53:46.880 --> 53:47.880
she's a robot.

53:47.880 --> 53:48.880
Yeah.

53:48.880 --> 53:49.880
That's science.

53:49.880 --> 53:55.080
Um, you could ask her to divide by zero to see what that does to her noodle.

53:55.080 --> 53:56.080
Oh shit.

53:56.080 --> 53:57.080
Yeah.

53:57.080 --> 53:58.080
Yeah.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.080
Yeah.

53:59.080 --> 54:00.080
That's a puzzle too, right?

54:00.080 --> 54:01.080
Yeah.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.080
Like could God make a rock so big that he couldn't move it?

54:02.080 --> 54:03.080
Like.

54:03.080 --> 54:04.080
Yeah.

54:04.080 --> 54:05.080
Yeah.

54:05.080 --> 54:06.080
If it's a religious robot, I guess.

54:06.080 --> 54:07.080
Yeah.

54:07.080 --> 54:08.080
A religi-bot.

54:08.080 --> 54:09.080
I'm Bibley, the Bible-bot.

54:09.080 --> 54:14.520
I know all the verses.

54:14.520 --> 54:18.920
What if, what if you were to say, hey, pi, what was pi again?

54:18.920 --> 54:19.920
That number.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.600
And then like try to remember it.

54:21.600 --> 54:25.000
And if she goes any more than like four or five digits, I'm going to go ahead and call

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
robot.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.440
Well, she might have that rain man thing.

54:27.440 --> 54:28.440
Oh fuck.

54:28.440 --> 54:29.440
Is rain man a robot?

54:29.440 --> 54:30.440
Yes.

54:30.440 --> 54:34.200
Ah, that would be so much better now.

54:34.200 --> 54:38.600
Ask her to watch AI and if she enjoys it, she's a robot.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.480
Rain man is basically Minority Report now.

54:40.480 --> 54:45.240
It's like Minority Report prequel, if you think about it.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.240
Holy shit.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.240
You are in Good Will Hunting.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.240
You are living in Good Will Hunting.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.200
It's like Baltimore Good Will Hunting.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.960
It's like the wire beats Good Will Hunting.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.080
I haven't seen, I haven't seen Good Will Hunting.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.400
What's it about?

54:55.400 --> 55:01.960
It's about two friends taking Hollywood by storm, enlisting the help of a wizard named-

55:01.960 --> 55:02.960
Patch Adams.

55:02.960 --> 55:07.840
A wizard of comedy named Patch Adams and going on to Oscar gold.

55:07.840 --> 55:08.840
That's the movie.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.840
It sounds like a fucking tight movie.

55:10.840 --> 55:11.840
It is fucking badass.

55:11.840 --> 55:12.840
It is pretty good.

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
Is that on Netflix?

55:13.840 --> 55:14.840
Yeah, it's on Netflix.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.400
And what they do, they hunt Patch Adams throughout the course of the movie.

55:17.400 --> 55:18.400
It's pretty badass actually.

55:18.400 --> 55:19.400
They do.

55:19.400 --> 55:20.400
This movie sounds incredible.

55:20.400 --> 55:24.720
Every time they catch him, he gives them some Hollywood wisdom like oh, like that and they're

55:24.720 --> 55:25.720
like oh, exactly.

55:25.720 --> 55:26.720
Please tell me that was your Robin Williams.

55:26.720 --> 55:27.720
My Robin Williams-

55:27.720 --> 55:28.720
Cut me off another slice of that, please.

55:28.720 --> 55:29.720
My Robin Williams is basically my dead knight.

55:29.720 --> 55:30.720
It's just FYI.

55:30.720 --> 55:31.720
I was like oh, daddy, a little fancy daddy.

55:31.720 --> 55:32.720
That's my dead knight.

55:32.720 --> 55:33.720
And here's my Robin Williams.

55:33.720 --> 55:34.720
Oh, oh, oh, Mr. Hammer, yeah.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.720
That's not bad.

55:35.720 --> 55:36.720
It's kind of like Artie meets dead knight.

55:36.720 --> 55:41.720
Now, can you do Robin Williams doing one of Robin Williams' trademark voices?

55:41.720 --> 55:46.720
Can you give me one of those?

55:46.720 --> 55:47.720
Yeah.

55:47.720 --> 55:54.720
Daddy, I'm going to rescue daddy.

55:54.720 --> 55:59.720
Who's Danny?

55:59.720 --> 56:03.720
Right back into dead knight from Daddy Shaq.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.720
Okay.

56:04.720 --> 56:05.720
It kind of vacillates.

56:05.720 --> 56:06.720
Man.

56:06.720 --> 56:07.720
Sorry.

56:07.720 --> 56:10.720
So this is what Google hunting is about.

56:10.720 --> 56:11.720
Okay.

56:11.720 --> 56:16.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Taco B. Who asks?

56:16.720 --> 56:19.720
Ladies, X-mas gift?

56:19.720 --> 56:26.720
Ladies, if you sexual partner asked for you to walk on him with your high heels for Christmas

56:26.720 --> 56:30.720
and that's the only gift he wants this year, would you do that for him?

56:30.720 --> 56:35.720
Step on his privates for him with your sexiest heels if he proved it does not harm him at

56:35.720 --> 56:36.720
all?

56:36.720 --> 56:39.720
I like that he clears up it's the only thing he wants for Christmas.

56:39.720 --> 56:41.720
Well, I should hope so.

56:41.720 --> 56:48.720
You can't be like, I'd like you to crush my genitals with your sexiest heels and also

56:48.720 --> 56:51.720
a Kindle.

56:51.720 --> 56:58.720
I mean, this seems like kind of a shitty present.

56:58.720 --> 56:59.720
Yeah, it is.

56:59.720 --> 57:00.720
By anyone's standards.

57:00.720 --> 57:02.720
Even if you're into this kind of thing.

57:02.720 --> 57:07.720
Even if you were the biggest ball crush fan on the planet, this seems like-

57:07.720 --> 57:08.720
And I am.

57:08.720 --> 57:09.720
Yeah.

57:09.720 --> 57:12.720
Not a lot of thought went into this.

57:12.720 --> 57:13.720
Yeah.

57:13.720 --> 57:18.720
It's like Griffin really loves mixing bowls.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.720
Let's get him a mixing bowl for Christmas.

57:20.720 --> 57:21.720
That's far too obvious.

57:21.720 --> 57:22.720
That's way too obvious.

57:22.720 --> 57:25.720
You didn't think of- no heart, no love went into that decision.

57:25.720 --> 57:26.720
You know what I'm saying?

57:26.720 --> 57:28.720
Like you've got to flip it on him.

57:28.720 --> 57:32.720
Make him think that you're going to step on his balls for Christmas and then maybe like

57:32.720 --> 57:33.720
step on his butthole.

57:33.720 --> 57:36.720
Like it's a new thing that he doesn't know about.

57:36.720 --> 57:39.720
But maybe he'll be just as big a fan.

57:39.720 --> 57:40.720
Discovery.

57:40.720 --> 57:41.720
That's the real gift here.

57:41.720 --> 57:47.720
What she needs to do is Christmas Eve sneak into the room wearing a Santa suit and her

57:47.720 --> 57:50.720
sexiest heels and he's like asleep, right?

57:50.720 --> 57:57.720
He's conked out, visions of sugar plums dancing in his head and then she just crushes his

57:57.720 --> 57:58.720
balls.

57:58.720 --> 57:59.720
And his sugar plums.

57:59.720 --> 58:00.720
And his sugar plums.

58:00.720 --> 58:02.720
He just crushes his sugar plums.

58:02.720 --> 58:07.720
Do you think that he would have time to get aroused or do you think your fight or flight

58:07.720 --> 58:08.720
would kick in?

58:08.720 --> 58:17.720
Oh man, I would be out of- there would be a Griffin shaped cloud in the bed.

58:17.720 --> 58:19.720
What's a bris?

58:19.720 --> 58:28.720
I think it's a party that Jewish people throw when the circumcision happens.

58:28.720 --> 58:31.720
Oh so it's a party for getting your wiener cut off.

58:31.720 --> 58:35.720
Which is actually, ironically, the exact opposite of a divorce party.

58:35.720 --> 58:36.720
Yeah.

58:36.720 --> 58:38.720
Or the same, am I right?

58:38.720 --> 58:39.720
Women.

58:39.720 --> 58:44.720
That's what I was going for but- I didn't- I didn't get it.

58:44.720 --> 58:47.720
Because she's leaving you so it's like you're going to put it back on, you know?

58:47.720 --> 58:50.720
Like you're getting the hood of your penis put back on?

58:50.720 --> 58:52.720
You know, like on King and Queens.

58:52.720 --> 58:53.720
Can they do that?

58:53.720 --> 58:55.720
Did you ever see that one on King and Queens?

58:55.720 --> 58:57.720
Wait, excuse me.

58:57.720 --> 59:02.720
Are you saying that there was an episode of King and Queen in which Kevin James had his

59:02.720 --> 59:04.720
wiener chopped off and then sewn back on?

59:04.720 --> 59:05.720
Had his circumcision-

59:05.720 --> 59:09.720
Well it was an arc, I mean it wasn't all of an episode.

59:09.720 --> 59:11.720
How many episodes was that arc?

59:11.720 --> 59:12.720
I mean was that sweets?

59:12.720 --> 59:13.720
It was like a two-ep arc.

59:13.720 --> 59:16.720
It was like a season ender to be continued.

59:16.720 --> 59:17.720
So it was like a cliffhanger.

59:17.720 --> 59:21.720
Don't you guys remember that ad campaign between the third and fourth season when there was

59:21.720 --> 59:26.720
a bunch of billboards with Kevin James with just his penis stump exposed?

59:26.720 --> 59:28.720
And saying, what will happen?

59:28.720 --> 59:34.720
And then like, I don't know, George Costanza's dad was looking disapprovingly like, ah, not

59:34.720 --> 59:35.720
again.

59:35.720 --> 59:38.720
And then Leah Remini was like, get it back.

59:38.720 --> 59:41.720
So who in this situation cut off his wiener?

59:41.720 --> 59:42.720
Was it a mystery?

59:42.720 --> 59:43.720
Yeah, it was like-

59:43.720 --> 59:48.720
That was what provided the suspense at the button of the end of the first half of the

59:48.720 --> 59:49.720
arc.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.720
Turned out it was Maggie Simpson.

59:51.720 --> 59:55.720
Guys, this is the weirdest fucking episode we've ever done.

59:55.720 --> 59:58.720
Yeah, that's saying something.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.720
Have you guys ever heard of cutting a hole in the bottom of a popcorn bucket?

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720
Yeah.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720
You could do that with a bowling ball.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.720
It's going to take some flexibility, and it's going to take some dedication, and it's going

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.720
to take some butter, but you are going to do it.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.720
You're going to pull it off.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.720
It will not, cannot feel good though.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:21.720
It will not be pleasurable, it will be raw, and no, not like you're thinking.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:27.720
Dig it, dig it deep in there, like stick your prick right in the back of the bowling ball,

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.720
like on the opposite side of the three holes so that when she tucks her three fingers in

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.720
there-

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720
What's up?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.720
There's a chance she may graze.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.720
She puts her two fingers and thumb in there, gives you a Minnesota pincher, and you are

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:41.720
off to the races.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720
Oh, man.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.720
But it is so important that she realizes what you've done before she bowls.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.720
So important.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.720
You have got to figure, getting into the situation, if you thought that was hard, try getting

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720
out of it.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720
It is.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720
Wow.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.720
Baby, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.720
My dick's in the wall?

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720
Yes, Travis.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720
That's what we were talking about.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720
I think.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.720
You know what I love?

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.720
What?

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.720
You don't kill a horse.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.720
You destroy it.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.720
The term for putting a horse down, which is like the saddest thing ever, I'm not making

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.720
light of that, except I totally am.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.720
You destroy, though.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.720
You throw the horse into the fires of Mountain Doom.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.720
That's basically what we're saying.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:39.720
I guess it sounds inhumane to be like, oh, my horse can't walk, so I totally emptied

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.720
a clip in his dome.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720
Murdered it.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.720
I popped a bullet in his bubble goose.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720
You don't do that.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.720
That's not enough.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720
That's not what he deserves.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720
He deserves to be destroyed.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720
He could come back.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.720
Oh, I obliterated that fucking pony.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.720
Hey, Justin.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.720
Yeah, Robbie?

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.720
Me and Robbie went to Peckers last night.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.720
Just got destroyed.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.720
Why are we riding towards Mordor, Justin?

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:08.720
Justin, are you going to pitch me into the fires of Mountain Doom?

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.720
God, this is awkward.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.720
I do need to destroy you.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:19.720
The more you say it, the more ridiculous it sounds like you're talking about your robot

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.720
best friend who turned evil.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.720
I must destroy him.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.720
The horse shall be no more.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.720
There's a button underneath their saddle.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.720
If you push it, it sends horse meat everywhere.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.720
He has the self-destruct button.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.720
I love you, Secretariat, but I'm going to fucking gib you.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720
You're done.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.720
I'm going to hit you with a rocket launcher, Robbie.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.720
I'm sorry.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.720
I don't know.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720
Horses.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.720
What big fucking stupid animals?

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:56.720
What other animal is like, I broke my leg, now I have to be destroyed?

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.720
It's exciting news, if this is the first place you're hearing about it.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.720
It is still pretty exciting, even if you already know.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:11.720
My brother, my brother, me, has joined with the Maximum Fun network.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.720
Voltron-like.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:18.720
We are the left foot of the Maximum Fun robot.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720
Right.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.720
Could we also be like Megazord?

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.720
Does it have to be Voltron, or can we go into Mighty Morphin Power?

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720
I'm more comfortable with Mighty Morphin Power.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.720
Ideally, we would be like Dragonzord, and we could be like our whole other mech, but

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720
I don't think it would reach that level.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.720
I'm not going down this road with you guys.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.720
No, no, I'm just saying we pull out our magic Green Ranger flute, and we summon the Dragonzord.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.720
I can't do it.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720
We don't have to make a big deal out of it.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720
I can't do this with you.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720
I can't do it.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:47.720
Oh, you're thinking more of like a white saber-toothed tiger, like Tommy the Red Ranger when he came

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720
back.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720
One more word, I'll quit.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.720
I swear to Jesus, I'll quit.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.720
No, this is an advice show for the modern era.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.720
And a Power Rangers fan cast.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.720
And a Power Rangers fan cast.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.720
We used to do VR Troopers too, but that one ran dry.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.720
If we get into Beatleborgs, I quit.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.720
We had a brief Big Bad Beetleborgs face, but we grew out of that pretty quickly.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.720
Yeah, now it's pretty much just advice and Power Rangers and tattooed teenage alien fighters

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.720
from Beverly Hills.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.720
Same for our pizza cats.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.720
Chick-a-chams.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.720
Put another log on there.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.720
It's a toasty show.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.720
It's funny to me that you should mention, you know, depending on your location, because

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.720
just this year I realized that just because it's snowing here doesn't mean it's snowing

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.720
everywhere in the world.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.720
Interesting, Travis.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720
Whoa, really?

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.720
This is like a rap and beats level confession.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.720
Yeah, it really was like, winter here is not winter everywhere else.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720
And I had no idea.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.720
I just assumed when it got cold here, the entire world was cold.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.720
And that's apparently not how the world works.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.720
That's like some, Trav, that's like some Middle Ages shit.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.720
Yeah, that's about the goddamn dumbest thing I've ever heard.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:01.720
Why, this is my brother, my brother, and my pet canary that somehow gained the ability

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.720
to talk.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.720
Chick-a-chams.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.720
National Eye Donor Month.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.720
Okay, let's do it.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.720
Right now.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.720
We don't need to go any further.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.720
Yeah, I'm going down the list.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720
National Eye Donor Month.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.720
Nothing beats eye donors.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.720
Friends, March is National Eye Donor Month.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.720
So, think about it.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.720
Are your kids really worth looking at with both?

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.720
My brother, my brother, and me?

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.720
Look around, see the flowers blooming and the children smiling.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.720
Well, some people can't, Stingy.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.720
Give up one of them.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.720
My brother, my brother, and me.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.720
That one didn't flow quite as well as you anticipated, did it?

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.720
No.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.720
How about this one?

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.720
You know that Jessica Alba movie, The Eye, where she gets the eye donation and then she

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.720
sees demons and it really fucks her shit up?

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.720
That only happens, like, one out of every five eye donations.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720
So don't worry about it.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.720
My brother, my brother, and me.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.720
It's like taking your contacts out only, like, times a thousand.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.720
My brother, my brother, and me.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.720
There you go.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720
See you back on the horse.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.720
Eyepatches.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.720
Uh-huh.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.720
What else are you going to do with all those eye patches?

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.720
It's like a permanent wink.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:15.720
My brother, my brother, and me.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:20.720
Well, the holidays are coming up, and I have a big bin full of worn out underwear that

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.720
our family has been accumulating for a while.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.720
I know I need some cushioning material for shipping out holiday gifts.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.720
Is it acceptable to use the underwear for this purpose?

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.720
Of course, the present will be inside a wrap box inside the shipping box, so it's not like

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.720
it will be inside the gift.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.720
BQ, what's your favorite winter holiday song?

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.720
What kind of fucking family are you in?

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:47.720
I think my favorite winter holiday song is, uh, you ruined our Christmas with your stinky,

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.720
awful old underwear that you wrapped around the iPod.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.720
Why does your family have a bin of worn out underwear?

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.720
Uh, well, additional details.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.720
Our family tries very, very hard to be eco-friendly.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.720
We don't have anything else to use, and the thought of buying extra paper or bubble wrap

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.720
to waste makes me cry for the earth.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.720
You know what makes me cry for the earth?

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.720
You know what makes me cry for the earth?

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.720
Your stinky, awful underwear.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.720
The crap that you're shipping through, you're shipping it through the U.S. Postal Service.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.720
I send my rent check to my landlord through that.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.720
I could open up, you might live in my neighborhood, I might open up your mailbox and get like

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:31.720
a fucking pungent, like a foamy spume of your fucking stinky old underwear that hits me

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.720
in the nose and stays with me for the rest of my life.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.720
I'm so, oh, fuck.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.720
It makes me mad that it sounds like you've already made this decision, because you've

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.720
been collecting this underwear for a while now.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.720
Yeah, what have you been doing?

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720
Where are you keeping it?

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.720
Hey, uh, hey dude, if you have to send it in dirty underwear, it ain't a gift.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.720
It ain't a gift, it's an oppa gift.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.720
God damn it, I don't, like, these green questions are straight bombing me out.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.720
They're really harshing my mellow.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.720
I wouldn't give a fuck if the earth had like six years left in it.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.720
If the earth had four years left in it and people didn't send underwear through the US

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.720
Postal Service, like, that's a trade off I'm willing to make.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:19.720
It can go 2012 up in 2016 as long as, as long as people stop pooping in bags and sending

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.720
their dirty ass underwear to their aunt.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.720
All I can think is there has to come a moment where like you go to pull out a pair of underwear

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.720
and you're like, oh this is covered in stains and the elastic is shot and your mom's like

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.720
put it in the bin.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.720
Put it right in the bin.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.720
Get it in the bin.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.720
No, fucking throw that shit out.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.720
Throw it away.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.720
You're not gonna reuse those textiles.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.720
Don't, don't fucking kid yourself.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.720
Hey check out my new winter coat.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.720
Lots of boxers went into this one.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.720
This one was sent in by CurlyHeadPoet.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:55.720
Thank you CurlyHeadPoet, it's by Yahoo Answers user Amy who asks, oh man, does anyone know

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.720
of any other grandpa names?

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.720
Oh no, it can't listen to the parameters, please.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.720
Okay.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.720
All right.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.720
All right.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.720
It cannot be poppy, grandpa, or pop pop.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.720
Gramps sounds like cramps.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.720
Don't go there.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720
Don't.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720
Don't even.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.720
Additional, additional details and please no names in other languages.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.720
This is America We Speak English.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.720
Did she say that?

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.720
Awesome.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.720
Awesome.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.720
That's awesome.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.720
That's really awesome, Amy.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720
Cool.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.720
Any P vowel P.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720
Vowel.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720
Sound.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.720
Yeah.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.720
You can, you're fine.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.720
Like pee pee.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.720
Well, maybe not that.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.720
No, not that.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.720
No.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.720
Uh.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.720
Papo.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.720
Papo.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.720
That's good.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.720
Popey.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.720
Peepums.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.720
As long as there's two P's.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.720
Go see your peepums.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.720
This is my peepums.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.720
Darrell, go see your peepums.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720
My peepums.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.720
My peepums always has the hardest, crumbliest chewing gum.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720
Don't.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.720
Now, Darrell, don't you eat peepum's nasty gum.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.720
You know what happened last time.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.720
Peepum's nasty gum sounds like a product that we should copyright immediately.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.720
Oh, God.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.720
I just purchased a pack of peepum's old-timey nasty gum.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.720
You're still in the juicy fruit?

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.720
Oh, that's bitch gum.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.720
I'm in a peepum's nasty gum.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.720
Fuck your fruit stripes.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:34.720
The thing about peepum's nasty gum is that you have to put the emphasis on a different syllable every time you say it.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.720
Peepum's don't even give a...

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.720
Oh, peepum's don't even give him that nasty gum.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.720
It's just a lot of the care for it.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.720
Um...

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720
Peepums.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.720
Wow, Trav, I am spent.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.720
That was just a lot of great humor.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:06.720
I feel like people don't appreciate how hard it is for us to recreate those bits in their entirety live as we're recording.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.720
Doing Griffin's voice alone is exhausting.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.720
Yeah.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.720

Yeah.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.720
Do you want to say something nice about NatureBox now, Travis?

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.720
Yeah.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Hey, do you like snacks?

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720
Yes.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.720
Remember what we talked about like 30 to 40 minutes ago?

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.720
About snacks?

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.720
About snacks.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.720
Do you remember?

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.720
Go to NatureBox.com and check it out.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.720
At least do yourself a favor and go look at all the different options.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.720
I promise you, you won't be able to look away.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.720
So go to NatureBox.com slash my brother to get 50% off your first order.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.720
Trust me, it's worth it.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720
Go check it out.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.720
So you're going to go to NatureBox.com slash my brother, HuluPlus.com slash my brother, and MakingThingsBeautiful.net.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.720
There's not a slash my brother on there, but I'm sure he'll get a custom domain going eventually.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.720
Go to all those.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.720
And also while you're typing in URLs, why not go to BoatParty.biz?

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:23.720
There is a big-ass cruise with all the coolest people that have ever lived on planet Earth,

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:32.720
and they're sailing the ocean blue with the Atlantic Ocean Comedy Music Festival July 25th through the 28th.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.720
They've got so many great guests.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.720
Moshe Kasher is going to be there.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:45.720
Carol Kolb, Kyle Kinane, Natasha Legaro, our dear, dear friend John Roderick of The Long Winters,

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.720
and many, many, many, many, many others.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.720
So don't miss out on that.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.720
It's at BoatParty.biz.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.720
One last thing, nbnbm.brownpapertickets.com.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:02.720
That's our show in LA at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern this Wednesday.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.720
And speaking of John Roderick, I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of the theme song.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.720
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.720
I feel like we do that every week.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:19.720
And really, it's 100 percent because it's such an amazing album that people need to listen to it.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.720
I won't rest until everyone has listened to it.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.720
So there.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.720
And that's going to do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.720
I hope you enjoyed what?

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.720
We have three live shows coming up in New York next week.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.720
It's going to be just a marathon day.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.720
So make sure you send in all the Yahoo answers you can.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:49.720
If you're going to be at the shows, send in questions specific, like, say, you know, 1 p.m. show, 4 o'clock, whatever they are, so that we can do your questions there live and call you out and embarrass you.

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.720
And we will try to hang out after all those shows as much as we can.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.720
We're going to be a little exhausted.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.720
What with the doing three shows.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:03.720
But we will do our best because we love you and we're there to see you, really, when we get right down to it.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:04.720
So that's it.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.720
That's – we don't have a final Yahoo.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.720
Travis, make him a final Yahoo out of whole cloth.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.720
All right.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:12.720
So these Yahoo answers come from Stephen.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.720
Stephen asked, why is my wiener sad?

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.720
That's not bad.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.720
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.720
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720
Kiss your dad.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:44.720
Square on the lips.
