WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
Ah, it's better, it's better with you

00:49.660 --> 00:51.660
My life

00:51.660 --> 00:53.660
Ah, ah, ah, ah

00:53.660 --> 00:55.660
It's better, it's better with you

00:55.660 --> 00:57.660
This is true

00:57.660 --> 00:59.660
Ah, ah, ah, ah

00:59.660 --> 01:01.660
It's better, it's better with you

01:01.660 --> 01:03.660
My life

01:03.660 --> 01:05.660
Ah, ah, ah, ah

01:05.660 --> 01:07.660
Ah, ah, ah, ah

01:07.660 --> 01:09.660
It's better with you

01:09.660 --> 01:13.660
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era

01:13.660 --> 01:17.660
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy

01:17.660 --> 01:21.660
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy

01:21.660 --> 01:23.660
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy

01:23.660 --> 01:25.660
Took too long

01:25.660 --> 01:27.660
Oh Griffin

01:27.660 --> 01:31.660
We were trying to do like a you're 1995 Chicago Bulls kind of stuff

01:31.660 --> 01:33.660
Travis wasn't on that trick

01:33.660 --> 01:35.660
McElroy, you are in

01:35.660 --> 01:39.660
England

01:39.660 --> 01:41.660
Oh, yeah

01:41.660 --> 01:43.660
And I think it sounds a little something like this

01:43.660 --> 01:45.660
Go ahead, Justin

01:45.660 --> 01:47.660
Go ahead, Justin, what does England sound like?

01:47.660 --> 01:49.660
Around him?

01:49.660 --> 01:51.660
Yeah, do like what England sounds like

01:51.660 --> 01:53.660
Here's the horse clomps

01:53.660 --> 01:55.660
This is like a village

01:55.660 --> 01:57.660
Yeah

01:57.660 --> 01:59.660
Your sconebread's ready, guv

01:59.660 --> 02:01.660
That's good, cool

02:01.660 --> 02:05.660
That's what it'll be like there. Travis, it's so weird that you're in England right now

02:05.660 --> 02:07.660
I mean, not while you're recording this

02:07.660 --> 02:11.660
But like, when you're listening to this, probably, you're in London

02:11.660 --> 02:13.660
Oh, wait, when I'm listening to it?

02:13.660 --> 02:15.660
Justin, I don't listen to our own

02:15.660 --> 02:17.660
You're in England

02:17.660 --> 02:19.660
You're in England, dude, how lucky

02:19.660 --> 02:21.660
How are you preparing?

02:21.660 --> 02:23.660
Okay, this is the thing about us

02:23.660 --> 02:25.660
A lot of people, we don't talk about it enough

02:25.660 --> 02:27.660
No, we don't talk about Bruno

02:27.660 --> 02:29.660
It's like Bruno

02:29.660 --> 02:31.660
We don't talk about it enough

02:31.660 --> 02:33.660
We all work out of our houses

02:33.660 --> 02:37.660
Our houses are not acclimated to, like, outside play

02:37.660 --> 02:39.660
Outside our house

02:39.660 --> 02:41.660
Or the sun

02:41.660 --> 02:45.660
So we have to have extremely specific nigh on hermetic conditions

02:45.660 --> 02:47.660
Correct

02:47.660 --> 02:49.660
That just sort of follow us around

02:49.660 --> 02:53.660
If we are to perform in the way to which people have become accustomed

02:53.660 --> 02:57.660
Travis, you are like, you're leaving the bubble in such a major way right now

02:57.660 --> 02:59.660
I've done a couple things

02:59.660 --> 03:01.660
You know how you're compensating

03:01.660 --> 03:03.660
I've done a couple things to prepare

03:03.660 --> 03:05.660
You can't, you're

03:05.660 --> 03:07.660
Travis

03:07.660 --> 03:09.660
I don't want to get too worked up about this, but you're going into a situation

03:09.660 --> 03:11.660
Where if you were

03:11.660 --> 03:13.660
In discomfort or inconvenience

03:13.660 --> 03:15.660
President Joseph

03:15.660 --> 03:17.660
Gordon Biden himself

03:17.660 --> 03:19.660
Could not intercede

03:19.660 --> 03:21.660
On your behalf

03:21.660 --> 03:23.660
Well, I have diplomatic immunity

03:23.660 --> 03:25.660
You're risking major political repercussions

03:25.660 --> 03:27.660
I moved to DC

03:27.660 --> 03:29.660
So I could be closer

03:29.660 --> 03:31.660
To the support of daddy

03:31.660 --> 03:33.660
I mean, Joseph Gordon-Biden

03:33.660 --> 03:35.660
By the president

03:35.660 --> 03:37.660
So that if I get hurt or uncomfortable

03:37.660 --> 03:39.660
Daddy would be

03:39.660 --> 03:41.660
I mean, Joseph Gordon-Biden would be right there for me

03:41.660 --> 03:45.660
Yeah, no, J.G. Biden gave me diplomatic immunity when I get over there

03:45.660 --> 03:47.660
So that's going to help a lot

03:47.660 --> 03:49.660
That's going to help a lot

03:49.660 --> 03:51.660
Also, I learned

03:51.660 --> 03:53.660
I don't know if you guys know this

03:53.660 --> 03:55.660
Every McDonald's in the U.K. operates as an American embassy

03:55.660 --> 03:57.660
So if I go there

03:57.660 --> 03:59.660
That's good

03:59.660 --> 04:01.660
So the two things that I've done to prepare

04:01.660 --> 04:03.660
Is one, I got those

04:03.660 --> 04:05.660
Those shoes

04:05.660 --> 04:07.660
That are like rubberized

04:07.660 --> 04:09.660
And they're like toe socks, but they're like rubberized shoes

04:09.660 --> 04:11.660
And that's going to help me walk on the cobblestones

04:11.660 --> 04:13.660
Well

04:13.660 --> 04:15.660
Did you really get the sock shoes?

04:15.660 --> 04:17.660
Well, I got it adjusted for the cobblestones

04:17.660 --> 04:19.660
For the cobblestones

04:19.660 --> 04:21.660
It helps with the grip

04:21.660 --> 04:23.660
Did you see Free Solo?

04:23.660 --> 04:25.660
So fucking funny

04:25.660 --> 04:27.660
I really expanded the canon a lot

04:27.660 --> 04:29.660
Now, the second thing I've done

04:29.660 --> 04:31.660
Did you ever read that children's book

04:31.660 --> 04:33.660
Where the man sells hats by stacking all the hats on top of his head?

04:33.660 --> 04:35.660
Yes

04:35.660 --> 04:37.660
I think it's called Come Get These Hats

04:37.660 --> 04:39.660
I've done that, but with masks

04:39.660 --> 04:41.660
So what I'm going to do is

04:41.660 --> 04:43.660
I've got a stack of masks

04:43.660 --> 04:45.660
About ten masks deep

04:45.660 --> 04:47.660
That I wear on my face

04:47.660 --> 04:49.660
Each one more powerful than the next

04:49.660 --> 04:51.660
And did you say Sticky Ricky hat stack shoes?

04:51.660 --> 04:53.660
Is the name of that book?

04:53.660 --> 04:55.660
Yeah

04:55.660 --> 04:57.660
Then the monkeys come and Sticky Ricky is like

04:57.660 --> 04:59.660
You took my hat stack, I don't want it to do now

04:59.660 --> 05:01.660
To God that I had just said Sticky Ricky hat stack

05:01.660 --> 05:03.660
Into oblivion

05:03.660 --> 05:05.660
My track could be lowered at that point

05:05.660 --> 05:07.660
So I was no longer on it

05:07.660 --> 05:09.660
We're going to have Rachel raise it up and lower it

05:09.660 --> 05:11.660
By the way, Tricky Ricky hat stack

05:11.660 --> 05:13.660
Oh, Sticky Ricky hat stack

05:13.660 --> 05:15.660
Is the sequel

05:15.660 --> 05:17.660
That makes a lot more sense

05:17.660 --> 05:19.660
That's the vivid entertainment version of it

05:19.660 --> 05:25.660
It sucks that me and Justin are just stuck here in stupid old America

05:25.660 --> 05:27.660
That's okay, you can hold it down

05:27.660 --> 05:29.660
We've been here for so long

05:29.660 --> 05:33.660
And haven't gotten a break like you're about to get

05:33.660 --> 05:35.660
Hey, I also just days ago

05:35.660 --> 05:37.660
Just two days ago

05:37.660 --> 05:41.660
Remembered that I needed to dig out my power adapter for the plugs

05:41.660 --> 05:43.660
Can we get this shit together? It's 2022

05:43.660 --> 05:45.660
Can we figure this out guys? It's metal and electricity

05:45.660 --> 05:47.660
I'm not saying it has to all be the shape of America's plug

05:47.660 --> 05:55.660
I'm saying how can we not as a planet universally decide on a plug shape

05:55.660 --> 05:57.660
Let's talk about it

05:57.660 --> 05:59.660
Let's get into this

05:59.660 --> 06:01.660
Countries get electricity at different times

06:01.660 --> 06:03.660
There's a chart I'm sure

06:03.660 --> 06:05.660
At night you don't need it

06:05.660 --> 06:07.660
Can none of them

06:07.660 --> 06:11.660
Are they so horny for electricity

06:11.660 --> 06:15.660
That they can't wait to ask the next country

06:15.660 --> 06:17.660
How did you guys do this?

06:17.660 --> 06:19.660
What was your plan?

06:19.660 --> 06:23.660
You meant they get it at different times throughout history

06:23.660 --> 06:27.660
Not that everybody takes turns using electricity throughout the day

06:27.660 --> 06:31.660
There is someone who did it first and then there's someone who did it second

06:31.660 --> 06:37.660
And the person who did it second looked at the country that did it first

06:37.660 --> 06:39.660
And was like, fuck that

06:39.660 --> 06:41.660
We can do a better plug

06:41.660 --> 06:43.660
But that's not how science works

06:43.660 --> 06:45.660
That's not how tech works

06:45.660 --> 06:47.660
Where you do one thing and then you rock with it

06:47.660 --> 06:49.660
Although that is how we've done plugs

06:49.660 --> 06:51.660
I think it sucks

06:51.660 --> 06:53.660
Every place has their own plugs

06:53.660 --> 06:55.660
And sometimes it's easy to get them twisted up

06:55.660 --> 06:57.660
Because there's different shapes of prongs

06:57.660 --> 06:59.660
I want just one big prong

06:59.660 --> 07:01.660
One big prong

07:01.660 --> 07:03.660
One big hole

07:03.660 --> 07:07.660
Not, I guess, big enough for a kid finger

07:07.660 --> 07:09.660
But like

07:09.660 --> 07:11.660
You're going to the promised land because the UK just made a rule

07:11.660 --> 07:13.660
Every plug's got to be USB-C

07:13.660 --> 07:15.660
No more lightning over there

07:15.660 --> 07:17.660
They don't got lightning in England

07:17.660 --> 07:19.660
Bring plugs

07:19.660 --> 07:21.660
They threw away all the lightning cords

07:21.660 --> 07:23.660
You have to

07:23.660 --> 07:25.660
That's the weird thing

07:25.660 --> 07:27.660
King Charles did it

07:27.660 --> 07:29.660
And then the only thing

07:29.660 --> 07:31.660
Then he abdicated and handed it to William

07:31.660 --> 07:33.660
That one thing was bugging me a lot

07:33.660 --> 07:35.660
What people don't realize is that

07:35.660 --> 07:37.660
Queen Elizabeth

07:37.660 --> 07:39.660
Made a law that it all had to be

07:39.660 --> 07:41.660
Micro-USB

07:41.660 --> 07:43.660
And actually it was

07:43.660 --> 07:45.660
Initially mini-USB

07:45.660 --> 07:47.660
It was mini-USB, the really chunky boy

07:47.660 --> 07:49.660
And Charles would sit behind her like

07:49.660 --> 07:51.660
Mom, please

07:51.660 --> 07:53.660
Mom, this sucks

07:53.660 --> 07:55.660
I can't charge my Nintendo DS

07:55.660 --> 07:57.660
Mom

07:57.660 --> 07:59.660
Please make it so that it's here

07:59.660 --> 08:01.660
The first thing he did when he's king, he's like, what's up?

08:01.660 --> 08:03.660
Give me all your lightning plugs

08:03.660 --> 08:05.660
They're going on a bonfire

08:05.660 --> 08:07.660
And what is your second proclamation?

08:07.660 --> 08:09.660
I didn't think beyond this

08:09.660 --> 08:11.660
I didn't have a lot of time to think about it

08:11.660 --> 08:13.660
Just like the last 70 years

08:13.660 --> 08:15.660
But I've decided

08:15.660 --> 08:17.660
I'm done now

08:17.660 --> 08:19.660
William, take it home

08:19.660 --> 08:21.660
The crown owns all the USB-C cords

08:21.660 --> 08:23.660
So

08:23.660 --> 08:25.660
Those are all owned by the king

08:25.660 --> 08:27.660
By the TV show The Crown

08:27.660 --> 08:29.660
Okay, bye

08:29.660 --> 08:31.660
The king

08:31.660 --> 08:33.660
Now owns all the swans

08:33.660 --> 08:35.660
In England, right? You know this thing

08:35.660 --> 08:37.660
That owns all the swans

08:37.660 --> 08:39.660
Now the king owns all the swans

08:39.660 --> 08:41.660
What?

08:41.660 --> 08:43.660
The queen

08:43.660 --> 08:45.660
The monarchy of England

08:45.660 --> 08:47.660
The queen of England

08:47.660 --> 08:49.660
She owned all the swans

08:49.660 --> 08:51.660
They legally belong to her

08:51.660 --> 08:53.660
Correct

08:53.660 --> 08:55.660
If you fuck with any swan in England

08:55.660 --> 08:57.660
The queen could come to you and be like

08:57.660 --> 08:59.660
That's my swan

08:59.660 --> 09:01.660
That sucks

09:01.660 --> 09:03.660
As long as we're on this note

09:03.660 --> 09:05.660
As long as someone whose job is like

09:05.660 --> 09:07.660
I take care of the ravens

09:07.660 --> 09:09.660
And that's his deal

09:09.660 --> 09:11.660
That's fine

09:11.660 --> 09:13.660
That's one bird keeper is fine

09:13.660 --> 09:15.660
Did the swans sign off on this?

09:15.660 --> 09:17.660
She also owns all the whales

09:17.660 --> 09:19.660
People don't talk about that as much

09:19.660 --> 09:21.660
It doesn't come up as often

09:21.660 --> 09:23.660
She owns all the whales

09:23.660 --> 09:25.660
It's rare, Justin, that you're driving too fast

09:25.660 --> 09:27.660
Down the motorway and hit a whale

09:27.660 --> 09:29.660
She's not as worried about those

09:29.660 --> 09:31.660
Well, she's not as worried about anything anymore

09:31.660 --> 09:33.660
Do you think

09:33.660 --> 09:35.660
She's dead, Griffin

09:35.660 --> 09:37.660
It's time that you accept it and move on

09:37.660 --> 09:39.660
Do you think when King Charles got the crown

09:39.660 --> 09:41.660
He found some swans that he had had particularly bad interactions with

09:41.660 --> 09:43.660
And was like

09:43.660 --> 09:45.660
What's up now?

09:45.660 --> 09:47.660
What's up now?

09:47.660 --> 09:49.660
Now who owns you?

09:49.660 --> 09:51.660
Justin, I actually think what happened is he got the crown and he went to sleep

09:51.660 --> 09:53.660
Heavy head, by the way, let's establish

09:53.660 --> 09:55.660
And then he was awoken in the middle of the night

09:55.660 --> 09:57.660
That was a bit of a fall

09:57.660 --> 09:59.660
But this crown is quite heavy

09:59.660 --> 10:01.660
And he was woken by a tick on his nose

10:01.660 --> 10:03.660
And there was just like a crowd of swans around

10:03.660 --> 10:05.660
And we're like, all right

10:05.660 --> 10:07.660
Now that she's gone, we've got some demands

10:07.660 --> 10:09.660
We want to make sure that you're looking out

10:09.660 --> 10:11.660
For our whole deal

10:11.660 --> 10:13.660
If you could bring back long necks as a beautiful thing

10:13.660 --> 10:15.660
I think that that is gone

10:15.660 --> 10:17.660
There's a narrative that is spreading

10:17.660 --> 10:19.660
That you're not supposed to give bread to birds

10:19.660 --> 10:21.660
And we hate that

10:21.660 --> 10:23.660
We don't like that

10:23.660 --> 10:25.660
So if you could bring

10:25.660 --> 10:27.660
Bread and also

10:27.660 --> 10:29.660
Peanut butter M&Ms in there

10:29.660 --> 10:31.660
We love peanut butter M&Ms

10:31.660 --> 10:33.660
And we never get to eat those

10:33.660 --> 10:35.660
And we've wanted to declare war on geese for a while

10:35.660 --> 10:37.660
And if you could like back us up on that

10:37.660 --> 10:39.660
If we could form some kind of alliance

10:39.660 --> 10:41.660
Of Britain and swans

10:41.660 --> 10:43.660
V. geese

10:43.660 --> 10:45.660
That would be really huge

10:45.660 --> 10:47.660
They all have a straight face for a long time

10:47.660 --> 10:49.660
And they all bust up like, ah, just kidding

10:49.660 --> 10:51.660
Geese and swan are the same birds

10:51.660 --> 10:53.660
One of us is pretty and one of us is ugly

10:53.660 --> 10:55.660
But that's just like humans, right?

10:55.660 --> 10:57.660
Some of you are prettier than others, right?

10:57.660 --> 10:59.660
Anyway, where's mom?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.660
What? What happened?

11:01.660 --> 11:03.660
Anyway

11:03.660 --> 11:05.660
That was, I think, actually the most

11:05.660 --> 11:07.660
Moving part of her state funeral

11:07.660 --> 11:09.660
Is when all the swans

11:09.660 --> 11:11.660
In England showed up to pay their respects

11:11.660 --> 11:13.660
It was really beautiful

11:13.660 --> 11:15.660
But Travis, you're in

11:15.660 --> 11:17.660
England. I hope you're having a good time

11:17.660 --> 11:19.660
I hope you're enjoying yourself. I hope I am too, Justin

11:19.660 --> 11:21.660
It's the future me

11:21.660 --> 11:23.660
Do you think you'll come back with an accent?

11:23.660 --> 11:25.660
I actually think I'll come back with

11:25.660 --> 11:27.660
Less of an accent than I have now

11:27.660 --> 11:29.660
Oh, okay. And what's that

11:29.660 --> 11:31.660
Going to sound like, Travis?

11:31.660 --> 11:33.660
Hello, I am Travis

11:33.660 --> 11:35.660
This is Travis and I am doggy

11:35.660 --> 11:37.660
Yeah, that's less

11:37.660 --> 11:39.660
British. Is this more pleasant for you,

11:39.660 --> 11:41.660
Griffin?

11:41.660 --> 11:43.660
Kinda, actually

11:43.660 --> 11:45.660
When Travis leaves the country

11:45.660 --> 11:47.660
Griffin and I become functionally unemployed

11:47.660 --> 11:49.660
This is true

11:49.660 --> 11:51.660
And such, we have had to record

11:51.660 --> 11:53.660
A lot of content in the past week

11:53.660 --> 11:55.660
True

11:55.660 --> 11:57.660
And I, honestly, I'm feeling

11:57.660 --> 11:59.660
Sometimes that goes one way

11:59.660 --> 12:01.660
Where it's like, I have nothing, I've never been funny

12:01.660 --> 12:03.660
Reddit's right

12:03.660 --> 12:05.660
And then

12:05.660 --> 12:07.660
Reddit's right about everything

12:07.660 --> 12:09.660
Sometimes it goes the other way where I just start feeling

12:09.660 --> 12:11.660
Loose. I feel like this is my default state

12:11.660 --> 12:13.660
The juice is loose, for sure

12:13.660 --> 12:15.660
The juice is loose on this one

12:15.660 --> 12:17.660
It's an advice show

12:17.660 --> 12:19.660
We're gonna read advice

12:19.660 --> 12:21.660
We're gonna do more than two questions this week

12:21.660 --> 12:23.660
Let's go. We only did one last week

12:23.660 --> 12:25.660
Only did one last week

12:25.660 --> 12:27.660
That's a huge, that's a

12:27.660 --> 12:29.660
I mean, 100%, can't be 100%

12:29.660 --> 12:31.660
Well,

12:31.660 --> 12:33.660
I believe the conversion rate, Justin, is one

12:33.660 --> 12:35.660
American question to 1.2

12:35.660 --> 12:37.660
British questions. I've been

12:37.660 --> 12:39.660
Setting up for a little bit

12:39.660 --> 12:41.660
By the way, though, I will say

12:41.660 --> 12:43.660
Exchange rate, you're going at a real

12:43.660 --> 12:45.660
Real choice, baby

12:45.660 --> 12:47.660
I don't acknowledge the

12:47.660 --> 12:49.660
Importance of money, so I guess

12:49.660 --> 12:51.660
That just doesn't matter to me. One currency

12:51.660 --> 12:53.660
One prong. One prong

12:53.660 --> 12:55.660
For all. Uniting us

12:55.660 --> 12:57.660
Thank you. Earth dollars

12:57.660 --> 12:59.660
Earth prongs. That's what I've always said

12:59.660 --> 13:01.660
Bit prong. Bit prong

13:01.660 --> 13:03.660
There's one prong for the

13:03.660 --> 13:05.660
Blockchain. Okay

13:05.660 --> 13:07.660
Um, I work the

13:07.660 --> 13:09.660
Graveyard shift at the chain grocery store

13:09.660 --> 13:11.660
Typically my job is to put things on shelves

13:11.660 --> 13:13.660
And make said things on shelves look nice

13:13.660 --> 13:15.660
Use a planet gram

13:15.660 --> 13:17.660
Do some merchandising. Oh yeah, planet

13:17.660 --> 13:19.660
Gram. Just love that. Oh god, what I wouldn't

13:19.660 --> 13:21.660
Do for a nice planet gram right now. However

13:21.660 --> 13:23.660
I also

13:23.660 --> 13:25.660
Find myself bringing

13:25.660 --> 13:27.660
Damaged goods to the damaged goods pile

13:27.660 --> 13:29.660
Choice, so another guy

13:29.660 --> 13:31.660
Can scan it and the store can get that

13:31.660 --> 13:33.660
Money back. Most of the

13:33.660 --> 13:35.660
Time, these are things like

13:35.660 --> 13:37.660
Dented or leaking cans, crunched up boxes

13:37.660 --> 13:39.660
And exploded jello cups. However, sometimes

13:39.660 --> 13:41.660
I will find an open box

13:41.660 --> 13:43.660
Of granola bars in the back of the shelf with a few

13:43.660 --> 13:45.660
Missing. Probably because someone decided

13:45.660 --> 13:47.660
Just stealing one or two would be easier

13:47.660 --> 13:49.660
Than stealing the whole box. My question is

13:49.660 --> 13:51.660
Would it be morally okay for me

13:51.660 --> 13:53.660
To also take a granola bar

13:53.660 --> 13:55.660
From that box. Yes, get the fucking granola

13:55.660 --> 13:57.660
It's not like they can go back on the shelf and the scanning guy

13:57.660 --> 13:59.660
Just needs to do the box itself, but also

13:59.660 --> 14:01.660
Like, it is stealing. That's from

14:01.660 --> 14:03.660
Conflicted in Colorado. Okay, okay

14:03.660 --> 14:05.660
Okay, Griffin is right. Here's the thing

14:05.660 --> 14:07.660
What you are asking is the wrong

14:07.660 --> 14:09.660
Question, question asker. Is it

14:09.660 --> 14:11.660
Morally okay? Yes, absolutely

14:11.660 --> 14:13.660
Might you get in trouble if you get caught?

14:13.660 --> 14:15.660
Yes. That is because

14:15.660 --> 14:17.660
Business practices

14:17.660 --> 14:19.660
Rarely line up with morality

14:19.660 --> 14:21.660
Listen

14:21.660 --> 14:23.660
Listen

14:23.660 --> 14:25.660
They expect you

14:25.660 --> 14:27.660
They almost want you to steal the granola bars

14:27.660 --> 14:29.660
And I'm not even going to say the word

14:29.660 --> 14:31.660
Verb steal anymore. It's

14:31.660 --> 14:33.660
Your labor

14:33.660 --> 14:35.660
Has value

14:35.660 --> 14:37.660
And you understand that, and your employer

14:37.660 --> 14:39.660
Understands that, and I can almost guarantee

14:39.660 --> 14:41.660
That you are not being

14:41.660 --> 14:43.660
You are not receiving fair compensation

14:43.660 --> 14:45.660
For that. But they can't tell you

14:45.660 --> 14:47.660
Like, you're

14:47.660 --> 14:49.660
Going to be paid $11.50

14:49.660 --> 14:51.660
An hour, which is like

14:51.660 --> 14:53.660
Not enough money for anything

14:53.660 --> 14:55.660
And also

14:55.660 --> 14:57.660
If you want to swipe

14:57.660 --> 14:59.660
If you want to take

14:59.660 --> 15:01.660
Also we offer vacation

15:01.660 --> 15:03.660
We offer vacation time to the

15:03.660 --> 15:05.660
Nature valley

15:05.660 --> 15:07.660
Quink, quink, quink, quink

15:07.660 --> 15:09.660
And where you'll have a

15:09.660 --> 15:11.660
Crunchy time

15:11.660 --> 15:13.660
They can't

15:13.660 --> 15:15.660
Say that. You need to take the granola bars

15:15.660 --> 15:17.660
You need to compensate

15:17.660 --> 15:19.660
Yourself with everything that you possibly can

15:19.660 --> 15:21.660
Okay

15:21.660 --> 15:23.660
Food dates, expiration dates

15:23.660 --> 15:25.660
They're made up. So we waste lots of

15:25.660 --> 15:27.660
Food that way. In Montana

15:27.660 --> 15:29.660
In Montana, they made a rule

15:29.660 --> 15:31.660
To protect the dairy industry there

15:31.660 --> 15:33.660
That you have to throw milk

15:33.660 --> 15:35.660
Out 12 days after pasteurization

15:35.660 --> 15:37.660
Which is a massive

15:37.660 --> 15:39.660
Incredible waste. That's ridiculous

15:39.660 --> 15:41.660
You can't even turn the stuff into cheese

15:41.660 --> 15:43.660
Anymore, because the processing plants

15:43.660 --> 15:45.660
Those that moved out of Montana, it's such a

15:45.660 --> 15:47.660
Ginormous waste. And the people

15:47.660 --> 15:49.660
Who, they were talking to a grocer

15:49.660 --> 15:51.660
On plant money, who's in the system

15:51.660 --> 15:53.660
And it's illegal for him to donate the milk to homeless

15:53.660 --> 15:55.660
Shelters. Illegal!

15:55.660 --> 15:57.660
For him to donate the milk

15:57.660 --> 15:59.660
But he

15:59.660 --> 16:01.660
You know what he does? He doesn't

16:01.660 --> 16:03.660
Donates the milk, because it's the right

16:03.660 --> 16:05.660
Thing to do. And the right thing

16:05.660 --> 16:07.660
For you to do, is to not let these

16:07.660 --> 16:09.660
Bars end up in a landfill

16:09.660 --> 16:11.660
Unless that landfill is called

16:11.660 --> 16:13.660
Reggie's tummy

16:13.660 --> 16:15.660
And your name is Reggie, and your body's a landfill

16:15.660 --> 16:17.660
Reggie! And then just like, take all

16:17.660 --> 16:19.660
Of them, eat one of them, hand out

16:19.660 --> 16:21.660
The rest to people you see who need some

16:21.660 --> 16:23.660
Who need a granola bar. And can I tell

16:23.660 --> 16:25.660
You something? That's

16:25.660 --> 16:27.660
Pretty much anyone could eat

16:27.660 --> 16:29.660
A granola bar at any time. That's why

16:29.660 --> 16:31.660
If it exists, no one's ever like

16:31.660 --> 16:33.660
I'm starving, I can't wait to get

16:33.660 --> 16:35.660
Home and eat a granola bar

16:35.660 --> 16:37.660
You have the granola bar with you, because that's

16:37.660 --> 16:39.660
Your moment to be like, I'm not hungry, but maybe

16:39.660 --> 16:41.660
I could be hungry in the future

16:41.660 --> 16:43.660
That is the tagline of granola bars

16:43.660 --> 16:45.660
Absolutely, it's like

16:45.660 --> 16:47.660
You don't want to eat this, but if you don't

16:47.660 --> 16:49.660
Eat something, you're gonna throw up

16:49.660 --> 16:51.660
So reach for Nature Valley

16:51.660 --> 16:53.660
Nature Valley, it's literally

16:53.660 --> 16:55.660
Better than nothing

16:55.660 --> 16:57.660
Um, hey

16:57.660 --> 16:59.660
Do you all want to go

16:59.660 --> 17:01.660
On over to

17:01.660 --> 17:03.660
Visit my friend

17:03.660 --> 17:05.660
And yours, the wizard? I feel like

17:05.660 --> 17:07.660
We were just there. Okay

17:07.660 --> 17:09.660
Well, we were just there, we do this every week

17:09.660 --> 17:11.660
Summer sent this in, thank you

17:11.660 --> 17:13.660
It's just like I see

17:13.660 --> 17:15.660
The wizard more than I see our dad

17:15.660 --> 17:17.660
And I don't know how I feel about that

17:17.660 --> 17:19.660
I feel, I mean our dad doesn't have

17:19.660 --> 17:21.660
Magic wisdom

17:21.660 --> 17:23.660
Not magic wisdom, but I mean

17:23.660 --> 17:25.660
He's seen a lot of shit

17:25.660 --> 17:27.660
He went through World War II, I think

17:27.660 --> 17:29.660
Yeah, he definitely did one of them, right?

17:29.660 --> 17:31.660
Our dad did at least one war

17:31.660 --> 17:33.660
He was in one of them, did he do

17:33.660 --> 17:35.660
Wait, hold on

17:35.660 --> 17:37.660
Is our dad a draft dodger?

17:37.660 --> 17:39.660
No, dad's not a draft dodger

17:39.660 --> 17:41.660
He would

17:41.660 --> 17:43.660
He was extremely close to being

17:43.660 --> 17:45.660
Drafted, and then

17:45.660 --> 17:47.660
The war ended, so he didn't

17:47.660 --> 17:49.660
Get it

17:49.660 --> 17:51.660
Drafted. How convenient

17:51.660 --> 17:53.660
As a result of this

17:53.660 --> 17:55.660
As a result of this

17:55.660 --> 17:57.660
Specific one only thing

17:57.660 --> 17:59.660
Dad used to extol the virtues

17:59.660 --> 18:01.660
Of Richard Nixon as a president

18:01.660 --> 18:03.660
Because whatever actions

18:03.660 --> 18:05.660
He did take

18:05.660 --> 18:07.660
Didn't prevent dad from going to Vietnam

18:07.660 --> 18:09.660
Whatever else

18:09.660 --> 18:11.660
Richard Nixon did the shit thing right

18:11.660 --> 18:13.660
One of our worst presidents

18:13.660 --> 18:15.660
Save for our daddy

18:15.660 --> 18:17.660
Okay

18:17.660 --> 18:19.660
As a beneficiary

18:19.660 --> 18:21.660
There's a very good chance the three of us

18:21.660 --> 18:23.660
Either wouldn't have been here or might have

18:23.660 --> 18:25.660
Been raised by a very different man

18:25.660 --> 18:27.660
A different Clint McElroy

18:27.660 --> 18:29.660
Oh god

18:29.660 --> 18:31.660
You okay? You hit your elbow?

18:31.660 --> 18:33.660
No, I'm having

18:33.660 --> 18:35.660
The idea of our dad on a battlefield

18:35.660 --> 18:37.660
Is giving your son

18:37.660 --> 18:39.660
His bud rimshot voice

18:39.660 --> 18:41.660
As he's getting shot at

18:41.660 --> 18:43.660
Stop, stop

18:43.660 --> 18:45.660
Oh man, in at least one of the

18:45.660 --> 18:47.660
Planes, Clint McElroy has probably been

18:47.660 --> 18:49.660
Anyway, our dad's not

18:49.660 --> 18:51.660
A good soldier, this is

18:51.660 --> 18:53.660
SummerSent this in, it's WikiHow

18:53.660 --> 18:55.660
How to take care of a

18:55.660 --> 18:57.660
Monster High doll

18:57.660 --> 18:59.660
If you have a Monster High doll

18:59.660 --> 19:01.660
But you don't know how to take care of it, this article can help

19:01.660 --> 19:03.660
Do you all have any of these in your house?

19:03.660 --> 19:05.660
Yes, I have Monster High dolls

19:05.660 --> 19:07.660
No, I don't allow representations of

19:07.660 --> 19:09.660
Demonic figures into my home

19:09.660 --> 19:11.660
Okay

19:11.660 --> 19:13.660
We just watched the Monster High movie

19:13.660 --> 19:15.660
There's this thing now with Kids Entertainment

19:15.660 --> 19:17.660
Where they turn cartoons

19:17.660 --> 19:19.660
Into real people

19:19.660 --> 19:21.660
Like, The Really Loud House

19:21.660 --> 19:23.660
You know that

19:23.660 --> 19:25.660
Uncanny Valley real people

19:25.660 --> 19:27.660
As the cartoon characters, Loud House Christmas

19:27.660 --> 19:29.660
That's a series now

19:29.660 --> 19:31.660
Why do we need to bring cartoons to life with real people?

19:31.660 --> 19:33.660
It's very upsetting to me

19:33.660 --> 19:35.660
See, I thought you meant like, where they were like

19:35.660 --> 19:37.660
You know how you love My Little Pony Friendship is Magic?

19:37.660 --> 19:39.660
Let's make them into more people

19:39.660 --> 19:41.660
Now they're called Equestria Girls

19:41.660 --> 19:43.660
And it's like, we're just gonna ignore the fact

19:43.660 --> 19:45.660
That they were once horses

19:45.660 --> 19:47.660
And are now people, it's normal, it's fine

19:47.660 --> 19:49.660
Don't worry about it

19:49.660 --> 19:51.660
I saw one of Hey Arnold, but it was

19:51.660 --> 19:53.660
It's the equivalent of looking at Deviant Art

19:53.660 --> 19:55.660
And like, taking one strap off the shoulder

19:55.660 --> 19:57.660
Like, is this what you want?

19:57.660 --> 19:59.660
Okay, well

19:59.660 --> 20:01.660
We'll make it more human-like, I guess

20:01.660 --> 20:03.660
Anyway, I was gonna make a great

20:03.660 --> 20:05.660
Hey Arnold joke, but that time has passed

20:05.660 --> 20:07.660
Now we're gonna learn how to take care of a Monster High doll

20:07.660 --> 20:09.660
Tending to your doll, comfort the doll

20:09.660 --> 20:11.660
Make sure she's not shy or afraid

20:11.660 --> 20:13.660
Close your eyes when something scary is happening

20:13.660 --> 20:15.660
And read about her online to make sure she is comfortable

20:15.660 --> 20:17.660
With any activity you might do with her

20:17.660 --> 20:19.660
Wait, wait

20:19.660 --> 20:21.660
That last bit? Yeah

20:21.660 --> 20:23.660
Whoa, that

20:23.660 --> 20:25.660
Hey, start to finish

20:25.660 --> 20:27.660
Sometimes there's a rollercoaster of emotions in a thing

20:27.660 --> 20:29.660
This was like a rollercoaster of like, questionable

20:29.660 --> 20:31.660
Except it just kept going down

20:31.660 --> 20:33.660
Further and further

20:33.660 --> 20:35.660
If there's necessary

20:35.660 --> 20:37.660
Care steps

20:37.660 --> 20:39.660
To the toy I've purchased

20:39.660 --> 20:41.660
At Target for $15

20:41.660 --> 20:43.660
I expect that documentation to be provided

20:43.660 --> 20:45.660
Alongside the toy

20:45.660 --> 20:47.660
It's not like in

20:47.660 --> 20:49.660
Fucking gremlins, they're like, look at this little

20:49.660 --> 20:51.660
Cutie pie, real cute

20:51.660 --> 20:53.660
You gotta take good care of him

20:53.660 --> 20:55.660
Get online, call the helpline, check the forums

20:55.660 --> 20:57.660
You'll get there

20:57.660 --> 20:59.660
Not that it would've fucking mattered

20:59.660 --> 21:01.660
Yeah, that kid

21:01.660 --> 21:03.660
He had three fucking rules, dude

21:03.660 --> 21:05.660
Three rules, not hard

21:05.660 --> 21:07.660
Hey, you know what? I own a dog

21:07.660 --> 21:09.660
Way more rules about keeping that damn thing alive

21:09.660 --> 21:11.660
It's like a billion rules

21:11.660 --> 21:13.660
Don't give it grapes, you know what I haven't done yet?

21:13.660 --> 21:15.660
Giving my dog grapes

21:15.660 --> 21:17.660
Yeah, you're crushing him

21:17.660 --> 21:19.660
You couldn't keep track of the fucking time

21:19.660 --> 21:21.660
To not feed them after goddamn midnight

21:21.660 --> 21:23.660
You loser

21:23.660 --> 21:25.660
I know, I know

21:25.660 --> 21:27.660
Change the doll's clothes

21:27.660 --> 21:29.660
Here's the thing that I don't like

21:29.660 --> 21:31.660
Griffin, I want to acknowledge something in that

21:31.660 --> 21:33.660
Go ahead

21:33.660 --> 21:35.660
Make sure your doll isn't scared of things

21:35.660 --> 21:37.660
But also cover their eyes when something scary happens

21:37.660 --> 21:39.660
And that just seems to me like

21:39.660 --> 21:41.660
I'm teaching the doll to be afraid

21:41.660 --> 21:43.660
And also, aren't they monsters?

21:43.660 --> 21:45.660
Yeah, they're Frankensteins and Dracula's and mummies

21:45.660 --> 21:47.660
Why, they're not scared?

21:47.660 --> 21:49.660
Yeah, famously

21:49.660 --> 21:51.660
Frankenstein's famously not afraid of

21:51.660 --> 21:53.660
Anything

21:53.660 --> 21:55.660
Except fire

21:55.660 --> 21:57.660
And a little girl one time

21:57.660 --> 21:59.660
And water and a

21:59.660 --> 22:01.660
Shadow and a bug

22:01.660 --> 22:03.660
Is a werewolf afraid of the moon?

22:03.660 --> 22:05.660
Or silver bullets or

22:05.660 --> 22:07.660
Does a werewolf acknowledge that those things are scary?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.660
It's afraid of how much it loves the moon

22:09.660 --> 22:11.660
It's like, oh, there's that thing again, I need it

22:11.660 --> 22:13.660
I need it

22:13.660 --> 22:15.660
Change the doll's clothes

22:15.660 --> 22:17.660
You don't want to be in the same outfit for two days and neither does she

22:17.660 --> 22:19.660
That's two assumptions you've just made there that are both

22:19.660 --> 22:21.660
Equally incorrect

22:21.660 --> 22:23.660
Buy her new clothes at a toy store or other shops

22:23.660 --> 22:25.660
You could also use other doll clothes that fit

22:25.660 --> 22:27.660
You can even try to make your own

22:27.660 --> 22:29.660
Also have a container or such to keep her clothes in

22:29.660 --> 22:31.660
You don't want to lose them

22:31.660 --> 22:33.660
As a parent

22:33.660 --> 22:35.660
That last bit is actually clutch

22:35.660 --> 22:37.660
They should listen to that, get a container, folks

22:37.660 --> 22:39.660
Get a container and make sure you keep all the clothes

22:39.660 --> 22:41.660
In the container

22:41.660 --> 22:43.660
Somehow my children have like

22:43.660 --> 22:45.660
Sort of shorts

22:45.660 --> 22:47.660
Dead drops all around the house

22:47.660 --> 22:49.660
So that if they

22:49.660 --> 22:51.660
If things go wrong

22:51.660 --> 22:53.660
And we need to bug

22:53.660 --> 22:55.660
Out

22:55.660 --> 22:57.660
They have options

22:57.660 --> 22:59.660
Shorts?

22:59.660 --> 23:01.660
Shorts with in-reach

23:01.660 --> 23:03.660
I will say that

23:03.660 --> 23:05.660
One of the things that I was not expecting as a parent

23:05.660 --> 23:07.660
Is how many

23:07.660 --> 23:09.660
Different spaces you need throughout your home

23:09.660 --> 23:11.660
For Barbie shoes

23:11.660 --> 23:13.660
Every room

23:13.660 --> 23:15.660
It's like a fire extinguisher

23:15.660 --> 23:17.660
Except for Barbie feet

23:17.660 --> 23:19.660
Which is like, well yeah

23:19.660 --> 23:21.660
In case there ends up being a Barbie within six inches

23:21.660 --> 23:23.660
Of any place, make sure that there's at least

23:23.660 --> 23:25.660
One pair of shoes in there

23:25.660 --> 23:27.660
At least according to my children, that's the deal

23:27.660 --> 23:29.660
For some reason chapstick has to be fucking everywhere

23:29.660 --> 23:31.660
Kids love this shit

23:31.660 --> 23:33.660
You guys heard about this?

23:33.660 --> 23:35.660
Kids love chapstick and acorns

23:35.660 --> 23:37.660
I mean what if, you know

23:37.660 --> 23:39.660
If we can make acorn flavored chapstick or chapstick shaped like acorns

23:39.660 --> 23:41.660
Richmond

23:41.660 --> 23:43.660
Cause what if Skipper drops a glass

23:43.660 --> 23:45.660
And it shatters

23:45.660 --> 23:47.660
And now all of a sudden Barbie don't want to get cuts on her feet

23:47.660 --> 23:49.660
And you need shoes everywhere

23:49.660 --> 23:51.660
Take her outside, they need fresh air like we do

23:51.660 --> 23:53.660
They don't

23:53.660 --> 23:55.660
If you bring Draculaura outside, make sure she has a toy umbrella

23:55.660 --> 23:57.660
Or sunscreen

23:57.660 --> 23:59.660
So she doesn't burn

23:59.660 --> 24:01.660
If you bring Laguna, make her weight in water

24:01.660 --> 24:03.660
If you bring Laguna, make her weight in water

24:03.660 --> 24:05.660
If you bring Laguna, make her weight in water

24:05.660 --> 24:07.660
Make sure you always keep an eye on your doll

24:07.660 --> 24:09.660
As not not lose it during your excursions

24:09.660 --> 24:11.660
As not not lose it during your excursions

24:11.660 --> 24:13.660
That's true because if you're not careful

24:13.660 --> 24:15.660
Hawks who's down picks it right up

24:15.660 --> 24:17.660
Hawks who's down will eat Draculaura whole

24:17.660 --> 24:19.660
I don't

24:19.660 --> 24:21.660
It's fucked up that in the same paragraph

24:21.660 --> 24:23.660
Is like, they need to go outside

24:23.660 --> 24:25.660
But Draculaura will die outside

24:25.660 --> 24:27.660
It's a high risk game for Draculaura

24:27.660 --> 24:29.660
It's a high risk game for Draculaura

24:29.660 --> 24:31.660
She needs it, but she will die if you do it wrong

24:31.660 --> 24:33.660
She'll burst into flames

24:33.660 --> 24:35.660
And that'll be on you

24:35.660 --> 24:37.660
The wet one must stay wet

24:37.660 --> 24:39.660
The wet one must stay wet

24:39.660 --> 24:41.660
It's a spooky season, right?

24:41.660 --> 24:43.660
I feel that more and more these days

24:43.660 --> 24:45.660
Vampire lore is getting pretty loose

24:45.660 --> 24:47.660
With the ability to go outside

24:47.660 --> 24:49.660
If I could take an umbrella out

24:49.660 --> 24:51.660
It's not that restrictive as a vampire

24:51.660 --> 24:53.660
If that's covering it

24:53.660 --> 24:55.660
Then it's just like, oh, I guess I'm fine now

24:55.660 --> 24:57.660
Then it's just like, oh, I guess I'm fine now

24:57.660 --> 24:59.660
I can wear a big hat and some

24:59.660 --> 25:01.660
I believe the word was sunscreen

25:01.660 --> 25:03.660
Never once in Vampirina

25:03.660 --> 25:05.660
Never once in Vampirina

25:05.660 --> 25:07.660
Do we ever see her feast on human flesh

25:07.660 --> 25:09.660
And I know that seems like a big jump

25:09.660 --> 25:11.660
But it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately

25:11.660 --> 25:13.660
And now my only six-year-old daughter

25:13.660 --> 25:15.660
Started to question like, she's a vampire, right?

25:15.660 --> 25:17.660
So she drinks blood

25:17.660 --> 25:19.660
And I don't know how to answer that

25:19.660 --> 25:21.660
But on the other side

25:21.660 --> 25:23.660
Dracula won't get her

25:23.660 --> 25:25.660
Like, that's why we love summertime

25:25.660 --> 25:27.660
Treat the doll like a child

25:27.660 --> 25:29.660
You are her mom

25:29.660 --> 25:31.660
So you need to take care of her

25:31.660 --> 25:33.660
Give her food, baths, and basically follow these instructions

25:33.660 --> 25:35.660
To make sure she is a happy doll

25:35.660 --> 25:37.660
Keep the doll safe

25:37.660 --> 25:39.660
Keep the doll safe

25:39.660 --> 25:41.660
She might get broken if you don't

25:41.660 --> 25:43.660
Or worse, what's worse?

25:43.660 --> 25:45.660
Dead

25:45.660 --> 25:47.660
Yeah, Lotso Love Bear

25:47.660 --> 25:49.660
You might throw her into a big fiery pit

25:49.660 --> 25:51.660
With all of your childhood toys

25:51.660 --> 25:53.660
Down a grate

25:53.660 --> 25:55.660
Where you can see her

25:55.660 --> 25:57.660
But you can't get to her

25:57.660 --> 25:59.660
Oh, that would be the worst

25:59.660 --> 26:01.660
Oh, that's bad

26:01.660 --> 26:03.660
Yeah, feed her to a Pennywise

26:03.660 --> 26:05.660
Pennywise eats your doll right up

26:05.660 --> 26:07.660
Another kid takes her

26:07.660 --> 26:09.660
From your hand to the playground

26:09.660 --> 26:11.660
Because the kid's bigger and stronger than you are

26:11.660 --> 26:13.660
But they don't know

26:13.660 --> 26:15.660
To go to wiki how to find out

26:15.660 --> 26:17.660
That Draculaura is alive

26:17.660 --> 26:19.660
So that's a fake

26:19.660 --> 26:21.660
Then you don't keep her grades up

26:21.660 --> 26:23.660
Undress the doll in a private place

26:23.660 --> 26:25.660
Like a bathroom or closet

26:25.660 --> 26:27.660
Or she might get upset that other Monster High dolls saw her naked

26:27.660 --> 26:29.660
Thank you

26:29.660 --> 26:31.660
That's based on decency

26:31.660 --> 26:33.660
You actually should not be there either

26:33.660 --> 26:35.660
You should leave the doll on the floor

26:35.660 --> 26:37.660
And then leave the room

26:37.660 --> 26:39.660
You need to use tools

26:39.660 --> 26:41.660
That mechanics use to get into your car

26:41.660 --> 26:43.660
When you lock your keys in the car

26:43.660 --> 26:45.660
And you close from under the crack of the door

26:45.660 --> 26:47.660
Now I think though

26:47.660 --> 26:49.660
There should be a step above that

26:49.660 --> 26:51.660
Where she's like, ask your Monster High doll

26:51.660 --> 26:53.660
Does she want the other Monster High dolls to see her naked

26:53.660 --> 26:55.660
Because maybe she's just like

26:55.660 --> 26:57.660
I love this

26:57.660 --> 26:59.660
I'm proud of everything that Monster God gave me

26:59.660 --> 27:01.660
Thank you, Monster God

27:01.660 --> 27:03.660
Thank you, Monster God

27:03.660 --> 27:05.660
For my rockin' bod

27:05.660 --> 27:07.660
That's what I say every day when I wake up

27:07.660 --> 27:09.660
I step out of the shower and I loudly announce

27:09.660 --> 27:11.660
Thank you, Monster God, for my rockin' bod

27:11.660 --> 27:13.660
And then I lotion up

27:13.660 --> 27:15.660
This is me talking, by the way

27:15.660 --> 27:17.660
Not a Monster High doll

27:17.660 --> 27:19.660
That would be weird

27:19.660 --> 27:21.660
No, this is important, that's Travis saying

27:21.660 --> 27:23.660
How he does his moisturization

27:23.660 --> 27:25.660
Create a humbly and proudly

27:25.660 --> 27:27.660
And devoutly

27:27.660 --> 27:29.660
And resoundingly

27:29.660 --> 27:31.660
And resoundingly

27:31.660 --> 27:33.660
It's kind of like the opening scene

27:33.660 --> 27:35.660
Praise Monster God for my rockin' bod

27:35.660 --> 27:37.660
And then I flagellate myself in private

27:37.660 --> 27:39.660
Then I apply the lotion

27:39.660 --> 27:41.660
It's basically like the opening to American Psycho

27:41.660 --> 27:43.660
Except there's like a swamp blob outside

27:43.660 --> 27:45.660
Like, yes, my child

27:45.660 --> 27:47.660
Yes, my child

27:47.660 --> 27:49.660
Good, good, good

27:49.660 --> 27:51.660
Anything else? Pancakes?

27:51.660 --> 27:53.660
Create a home

27:53.660 --> 27:55.660
Where is home for your doll?

27:55.660 --> 27:57.660
In your drawers? Under your bed?

27:57.660 --> 27:59.660
Well, imagine this

27:59.660 --> 28:01.660
A nice house for your doll to sleep in at night

28:01.660 --> 28:03.660
A place to have parties with friends

28:03.660 --> 28:05.660
Or just eat pizza

28:05.660 --> 28:07.660
I'm not gonna

28:07.660 --> 28:09.660
This is such a big part

28:09.660 --> 28:11.660
This paragraph is way too big for me to read

28:11.660 --> 28:13.660
And have it be funny

28:13.660 --> 28:15.660
But basically, if it's a water doll

28:15.660 --> 28:17.660
Make it look like water

28:17.660 --> 28:19.660
If it's a wolf, do woman

28:19.660 --> 28:21.660
Oh, in the home? In the home, yeah

28:21.660 --> 28:23.660
And then make sure the doll likes her home

28:23.660 --> 28:25.660
Fill it with furniture and make sure there's a bathroom

28:25.660 --> 28:27.660
You may also choose to give it a theme

28:27.660 --> 28:29.660
If you had Draculaura

28:29.660 --> 28:31.660
You can make the walls black slash pink

28:31.660 --> 28:33.660
And make sure she doesn't have any windows

28:33.660 --> 28:35.660
Design the house depending on what the doll is like

28:35.660 --> 28:37.660
I'm worried about

28:39.660 --> 28:41.660
What you're doing to the resale value

28:41.660 --> 28:43.660
What you're doing to your equity

28:43.660 --> 28:45.660
In the home

28:45.660 --> 28:47.660
If you remove the windows

28:47.660 --> 28:49.660
So that your vampire doll

28:49.660 --> 28:51.660
Doesn't die

28:53.660 --> 28:55.660
You're assuring at that point

28:55.660 --> 28:57.660
The house will only be sold to other Draculauras

28:57.660 --> 28:59.660
Which is, you're really limiting yourself

28:59.660 --> 29:01.660
It's a much limited market

29:01.660 --> 29:03.660
Are they talking about like

29:03.660 --> 29:05.660
In your actual home?

29:05.660 --> 29:07.660
No, there's a guy like a shoe box

29:07.660 --> 29:09.660
They got like a shoe box

29:09.660 --> 29:11.660
And they've taped up

29:11.660 --> 29:13.660
Some pictures of scary stuff inside the box

29:13.660 --> 29:15.660
Which is basically

29:15.660 --> 29:17.660
Oh yeah, they love that

29:17.660 --> 29:19.660
But not too scary

29:19.660 --> 29:21.660
Give your Draculaura

29:21.660 --> 29:23.660
Gallons of blood

29:23.660 --> 29:25.660
Pour it right over her

29:25.660 --> 29:27.660
She'll love it

29:27.660 --> 29:29.660
I'm gonna shoot through this next section real fast

29:29.660 --> 29:31.660
Brush the doll's hair, style it

29:31.660 --> 29:33.660
Matches her outfits, give the doll a bath

29:33.660 --> 29:35.660
Remove grime

29:35.660 --> 29:37.660
With nail varnish slash polish remover

29:37.660 --> 29:39.660
And get some q-tips, do be careful with that

29:39.660 --> 29:41.660
Because you might also remove

29:41.660 --> 29:43.660
Eye and

29:43.660 --> 29:45.660
Mouth and face

29:45.660 --> 29:47.660
Parts of it

29:47.660 --> 29:49.660
Change the clothes, we already did that, thank you

29:49.660 --> 29:51.660
Clean the doll's

29:51.660 --> 29:53.660
Clothes routinely and clean the doll's hair

29:53.660 --> 29:55.660
Just one more time, gonna get in there and make sure that

29:55.660 --> 29:57.660
That hair is very very clean

29:57.660 --> 29:59.660
Um

29:59.660 --> 30:01.660
This is a baby

30:01.660 --> 30:03.660
This is a

30:03.660 --> 30:05.660
Baby

30:05.660 --> 30:07.660
Oh, what you're doing is taking care of a baby, is that what you're saying?

30:07.660 --> 30:09.660
Yes

30:09.660 --> 30:11.660
This is a baby

30:11.660 --> 30:13.660
And maybe there's something to that

30:13.660 --> 30:15.660
Because that's part of the simulation

30:15.660 --> 30:17.660
And that's what's cool, but also the baby

30:17.660 --> 30:19.660
Can turn into

30:19.660 --> 30:21.660
Some sort of

30:21.660 --> 30:23.660
Lich or something

30:23.660 --> 30:25.660
Also, I just want to say

30:25.660 --> 30:27.660
We're all three parents

30:27.660 --> 30:29.660
If one of the girls in Monster High could turn into a lich

30:29.660 --> 30:31.660
What would her name be?

30:31.660 --> 30:33.660
Um

30:33.660 --> 30:35.660
Yeah, this is a good one

30:35.660 --> 30:37.660
I don't know

30:37.660 --> 30:39.660
The naming conventions of Monster High

30:39.660 --> 30:41.660
Lichina?

30:41.660 --> 30:43.660
Sounds great

30:43.660 --> 30:45.660
Well, I'll come back to it

30:45.660 --> 30:47.660
The author of this WikiHow article, we're all three kids

30:47.660 --> 30:49.660
We're all three parents at this point, we got kids

30:49.660 --> 30:51.660
And the author

30:51.660 --> 30:53.660
Of this WikiHow article is assuming that

30:53.660 --> 30:55.660
What children love most about toys

30:55.660 --> 30:57.660
Is the amount of restriction and responsibility

30:57.660 --> 30:59.660
That come with them

30:59.660 --> 31:01.660
I don't think that's the case

31:01.660 --> 31:03.660
My daughters both like having dolls

31:03.660 --> 31:05.660
And baby dolls, and then they mostly spend a lot

31:05.660 --> 31:07.660
Of time swinging those around

31:07.660 --> 31:09.660
And dropping them off stuff

31:09.660 --> 31:11.660
And just really kind of fucking them up

31:11.660 --> 31:13.660
In a way that I don't think they're like

31:13.660 --> 31:15.660
Better be careful of the sun

31:15.660 --> 31:17.660
Oh, gotta make sure I bathe these things

31:17.660 --> 31:19.660
So much as they're like, look at this slide

31:19.660 --> 31:21.660
And then drop them from like four feet off the ground

31:21.660 --> 31:23.660
This article

31:23.660 --> 31:25.660
Is so much longer, the next segment

31:25.660 --> 31:27.660
Is all about individual tips for each

31:27.660 --> 31:29.660
Monster High doll, so maybe

31:29.660 --> 31:31.660
We'll just like

31:31.660 --> 31:33.660
Shoot through, if you're playing with Rochelle Goyle

31:33.660 --> 31:35.660
Make sure you give her a good

31:35.660 --> 31:37.660
Pet

31:37.660 --> 31:39.660
I assume that means

31:39.660 --> 31:41.660
Like a familiar or a creature

31:41.660 --> 31:43.660
And not to like

31:43.660 --> 31:45.660
Pet the doll hard or something

31:45.660 --> 31:47.660
Like that

31:47.660 --> 31:49.660
With Frankie Stein

31:49.660 --> 31:51.660
This is an important one, and don't get these

31:51.660 --> 31:53.660
Switched up, if you play with Frankie Stein

31:53.660 --> 31:55.660
You can give her a boyfriend

31:55.660 --> 31:57.660
If you want

31:57.660 --> 31:59.660
But if you're playing with

31:59.660 --> 32:01.660
Abby Bominable

32:01.660 --> 32:03.660
If you're playing with Abby Bominable

32:03.660 --> 32:05.660
Don't make Abby flirt with

32:05.660 --> 32:07.660
Any boys she says is not

32:07.660 --> 32:09.660
Honorable, that's

32:09.660 --> 32:11.660
Abby Bominable

32:11.660 --> 32:13.660
Says is not honorable?

32:13.660 --> 32:15.660
Or don't make her flirt with any

32:15.660 --> 32:17.660
Boys that she says is not honorable

32:17.660 --> 32:19.660
Like that boy's not honorable

32:19.660 --> 32:21.660
Like this boy

32:21.660 --> 32:23.660
This trash bag

32:23.660 --> 32:25.660
This trash bag over here

32:25.660 --> 32:27.660
Leave that one for Frankie Stein

32:27.660 --> 32:29.660
Who will eat up the trash, cause she will date

32:29.660 --> 32:31.660
Whatever

32:31.660 --> 32:33.660
If you're gonna give Frankie Stein a boyfriend

32:33.660 --> 32:35.660
You should make it out of spare parts of other

32:35.660 --> 32:37.660
Kins or something, right?

32:37.660 --> 32:39.660
I think she'd really appreciate that

32:39.660 --> 32:41.660
That feels like a thing Frankie Stein would be into

32:41.660 --> 32:43.660
Make me a boyfriend

32:43.660 --> 32:45.660
This is a huge one, if you are playing with Claudine Wolf

32:45.660 --> 32:47.660
Make sure that when you turn off

32:47.660 --> 32:49.660
The light, Claudine goes crazy

32:49.660 --> 32:51.660
And you may be wondering

32:51.660 --> 32:53.660
How do I do

32:53.660 --> 32:55.660
How would I go about accomplishing that?

32:55.660 --> 32:57.660
And the answer is

32:57.660 --> 32:59.660
I guess you tape her to a Roomba

33:01.660 --> 33:03.660
A light sensitive

33:03.660 --> 33:05.660
Roomba?

33:05.660 --> 33:07.660
And then you shout the command word

33:07.660 --> 33:09.660
That makes the Roomba go just like fucking

33:09.660 --> 33:11.660
Ballistic

33:11.660 --> 33:13.660
Just absolutely ape shit

33:13.660 --> 33:15.660
I mean if you're playing with Claudine

33:15.660 --> 33:17.660
Justin, speaking of Roombas

33:17.660 --> 33:19.660
I just watched Hocus Pocus 2

33:19.660 --> 33:21.660
You did not tell me what a significant plot

33:21.660 --> 33:23.660
Importance

33:23.660 --> 33:25.660
Roombas have in that movie

33:25.660 --> 33:27.660
Yeah, Roombas are a huge part of the plot

33:27.660 --> 33:29.660
If you are playing

33:29.660 --> 33:31.660
If I told you

33:31.660 --> 33:33.660
That

33:33.660 --> 33:35.660
In Hocus Pocus

33:35.660 --> 33:37.660
At one point, Kathy the Jimmy

33:37.660 --> 33:39.660
Can't find a broom

33:39.660 --> 33:41.660
So she duct tapes two

33:41.660 --> 33:43.660
Magical Roombas to her feet

33:43.660 --> 33:45.660
Like a hoverboard

33:45.660 --> 33:47.660
Did you think that I was making that up as a joke

33:47.660 --> 33:49.660
For our show or that I'm saying

33:49.660 --> 33:51.660
Apart from the movie Hocus Pocus 2

33:51.660 --> 33:53.660
That's good and a good joke

33:53.660 --> 33:55.660
And I bet you, can I say something?

33:55.660 --> 33:57.660
I bet you Kathy fucking

33:57.660 --> 33:59.660
Sold it. I bet you she made you bust up with that

33:59.660 --> 34:01.660
Oh, she's having the time of her life

34:01.660 --> 34:03.660
Yeah, and so are you

34:03.660 --> 34:05.660
There is one prolonged shot

34:05.660 --> 34:07.660
In the movie as the

34:07.660 --> 34:09.660
Characters on screen are very minimal

34:09.660 --> 34:11.660
In the foreground and mostly the focus of the shot

34:11.660 --> 34:13.660
Is just a glowing Walgreens

34:13.660 --> 34:15.660
And it is a Walgreens

34:15.660 --> 34:17.660
And it lingers on it for

34:17.660 --> 34:19.660
What feels like 30 solid seconds

34:19.660 --> 34:21.660
And then Walgreens is

34:21.660 --> 34:23.660
Referenced, there are multiple

34:23.660 --> 34:25.660
Scenes in a Walgreens

34:25.660 --> 34:27.660
Walgreens once again plays a

34:27.660 --> 34:29.660
Pivotal role in Hocus Pocus 2

34:29.660 --> 34:31.660
And every shot is framed as like

34:31.660 --> 34:33.660
Kathy the Jimmy, Bette Midler

34:33.660 --> 34:35.660
And a huge red W in between them

34:35.660 --> 34:37.660
Always separated and framed

34:37.660 --> 34:39.660
By Walgreens logo. They replaced Sarah

34:39.660 --> 34:41.660
Jessica Parker with the Walgreens logo?

34:41.660 --> 34:43.660
Yeah

34:43.660 --> 34:45.660
Hey guys, if you're playing with Cleo Denial

34:45.660 --> 34:47.660
Feed her grapes and

34:47.660 --> 34:49.660
It may seem like she can't

34:49.660 --> 34:51.660
But if you push the

34:51.660 --> 34:53.660
Grapes into the

34:53.660 --> 34:55.660
Into her face hard enough

34:55.660 --> 34:57.660
You can make pretend

34:57.660 --> 34:59.660
Anything. They will go away. They will go away

34:59.660 --> 35:01.660
Eventually

35:01.660 --> 35:03.660
Um, if you're playing

35:03.660 --> 35:05.660
With Toralei sometimes she might scratch the furniture

35:05.660 --> 35:07.660
That's it. Like you know that that's what

35:07.660 --> 35:09.660
You're gonna go with. If you're playing with

35:09.660 --> 35:11.660
Ghoulia Yelps, this one's

35:11.660 --> 35:13.660
This one's great cause if you are playing with Ghoulia Yelps this will be

35:13.660 --> 35:15.660
My last tip for this

35:15.660 --> 35:17.660
Halloween segment. You gotta feed her

35:17.660 --> 35:19.660
Brains and fast food

35:19.660 --> 35:21.660
Kill

35:21.660 --> 35:23.660
Kill

35:23.660 --> 35:25.660
Living things

35:25.660 --> 35:27.660
That have a brain

35:27.660 --> 35:29.660
In it to give to your

35:29.660 --> 35:31.660
Doll and or

35:31.660 --> 35:33.660
Hit up Barbies

35:33.660 --> 35:35.660
If

35:35.660 --> 35:37.660
Arby's sold brain

35:37.660 --> 35:39.660
If Arby's sold brain meat, which

35:39.660 --> 35:41.660
Their motto would make you

35:41.660 --> 35:43.660
Think that they do. They got the meat

35:43.660 --> 35:45.660
Yeah, you'd think

35:45.660 --> 35:47.660
You should be able to go into Arby's

35:47.660 --> 35:49.660
And be like, for me, I would like

35:49.660 --> 35:51.660
A big Cheddar Boy

35:51.660 --> 35:53.660
A number 16 Cheddar

35:53.660 --> 35:55.660
Boy combo meal

35:55.660 --> 35:57.660
And for this one, Ghoulia Yelps

35:57.660 --> 35:59.660
And you put her up on the counter and you say, you know what to do

35:59.660 --> 36:01.660
With her. You take her back

36:01.660 --> 36:03.660
To the back where you keep the

36:03.660 --> 36:05.660
The bad meats

36:05.660 --> 36:07.660
The meats that you maybe don't want people

36:07.660 --> 36:09.660
To know that you do have on offer

36:09.660 --> 36:11.660
And you make sure she is sated

36:11.660 --> 36:13.660
Yeah. Thank you

36:13.660 --> 36:15.660
Of course. Thank you. She'll die without it

36:15.660 --> 36:17.660
And she's my best friend

36:17.660 --> 36:19.660
What about Cauliflower?

36:19.660 --> 36:21.660
The doll Cauliflower

36:21.660 --> 36:23.660
The brains? Fuck off

36:23.660 --> 36:25.660
Oh, I thought you were saying there's a Monster High doll called

36:25.660 --> 36:27.660
Cauliflower. That's awesome

36:27.660 --> 36:29.660
All the other dolls are like

36:29.660 --> 36:31.660
It could be Griffin, it would be Carla Flower

36:31.660 --> 36:33.660
Thank you very much

36:33.660 --> 36:35.660
But what would that be referencing, Charles?

36:35.660 --> 36:37.660
What great monster is that?

36:37.660 --> 36:39.660
That's fun if there was one of them that was just like

36:39.660 --> 36:41.660
Vegetables. Yeah

36:41.660 --> 36:43.660
It could be anything just

36:43.660 --> 36:45.660
It could be Swamp Thing. It could be Man Thing

36:45.660 --> 36:47.660
It could be Audrey 2 from Little Swamp of course

36:47.660 --> 36:49.660
It could be, there are man eating plants

36:49.660 --> 36:51.660
All over the fucking place. Read a book

36:53.660 --> 36:55.660
Charlie got these toys for her

36:55.660 --> 36:57.660
For her birthday

36:57.660 --> 36:59.660
Riley got Charlie

36:59.660 --> 37:01.660
This stuffed

37:01.660 --> 37:03.660
Guinea Pig in a cage

37:03.660 --> 37:05.660
And the thing about it is that

37:05.660 --> 37:07.660
It's pregnant

37:07.660 --> 37:09.660
With other smaller

37:09.660 --> 37:11.660
Baby Guinea Pigs. Oh, cool. Great

37:11.660 --> 37:13.660
But the birthing happens

37:13.660 --> 37:15.660
Automatically

37:15.660 --> 37:17.660
Huh? So

37:17.660 --> 37:19.660
On a certain timer

37:19.660 --> 37:21.660
You turn it on and eventually

37:21.660 --> 37:23.660
The first baby

37:23.660 --> 37:25.660
Well, what it does is it pops out of the top

37:25.660 --> 37:27.660
And just kind of lands on the mom

37:27.660 --> 37:29.660
Guinea Pig and rolls off and then she had a baby

37:29.660 --> 37:31.660
And the mom eats it. Yeah, normal

37:31.660 --> 37:33.660
No, mom does, you know, you open that and it's like a surprise

37:33.660 --> 37:35.660
Toy, right? You see what kind of Guinea Pig

37:35.660 --> 37:37.660
Just like real life

37:37.660 --> 37:39.660
And it's set to do this over a 24

37:39.660 --> 37:41.660
Hour period

37:41.660 --> 37:43.660
Where periodically, over this 24 hours

37:43.660 --> 37:45.660
This thing will just give

37:45.660 --> 37:47.660
Birth. Does it at least make a noise?

37:47.660 --> 37:49.660
Can you set it in the corner and tell

37:49.660 --> 37:51.660
You hear it go like

37:51.660 --> 37:53.660
And then you know like, oh honey

37:53.660 --> 37:55.660
Yeah, there's noises. Not again!

37:55.660 --> 37:57.660
There's 100% birthing noises, 100%

37:57.660 --> 37:59.660
But if you bought this gift

37:59.660 --> 38:01.660
For somebody who does not have that

38:01.660 --> 38:03.660
Kind of attention span, like say

38:03.660 --> 38:05.660
A child

38:05.660 --> 38:07.660
There is a switch on it

38:07.660 --> 38:09.660
That's basically like

38:09.660 --> 38:11.660
Turbo mode

38:11.660 --> 38:13.660
It's like it gets

38:13.660 --> 38:15.660
Here we go

38:15.660 --> 38:17.660
You like

38:17.660 --> 38:19.660
Flip this switch to make this

38:19.660 --> 38:21.660
Guinea Pig just go into like

38:21.660 --> 38:23.660
Turbo child birthing

38:23.660 --> 38:25.660
And it's probably the

38:25.660 --> 38:27.660
Wildest option that

38:27.660 --> 38:29.660
I have seen on a toy is like, let's just kick

38:29.660 --> 38:31.660
This birth cycle into overdrive

38:33.660 --> 38:35.660
And crank it up

38:35.660 --> 38:37.660
Let's go to Money Zone. I think it's Money Zone time

38:37.660 --> 38:39.660
Yeah, let's go to Money Zone

38:39.660 --> 38:41.660
It's better with you

38:41.660 --> 38:43.660
It's better with you

38:43.660 --> 38:45.660
It's better with you

38:49.660 --> 38:51.660
You know guys, with my international travel

38:51.660 --> 38:53.660
I have been studying up a lot

38:53.660 --> 38:55.660
Using Babbel and I

38:55.660 --> 38:57.660
Have been studying

38:57.660 --> 38:59.660
English. So I now say

38:59.660 --> 39:01.660
Yeah, I've learned how to say like bangers

39:01.660 --> 39:03.660
And lift and

39:03.660 --> 39:05.660
I say like biscuits and flat

39:05.660 --> 39:07.660
How did you pull this off

39:07.660 --> 39:09.660
I know that you don't really apply yourself

39:09.660 --> 39:11.660
To stuff. Well, I already said Justin

39:11.660 --> 39:13.660
I used Babbel

39:13.660 --> 39:15.660
I guess I was going to

39:15.660 --> 39:17.660
Drill down on like maybe what even

39:17.660 --> 39:19.660
Is that at all? Oh, okay

39:19.660 --> 39:21.660
Well, it's like an app

39:21.660 --> 39:23.660
It's a language learning app

39:23.660 --> 39:25.660
That sold like more than 10 million

39:25.660 --> 39:27.660
Subscriptions and it's not just English I should point out

39:27.660 --> 39:29.660
You can also do like Spanish or German or Italian

39:29.660 --> 39:31.660
Or French or Portuguese or Swedish or Turkish or

39:31.660 --> 39:33.660
Dutch, Polish, Indonesian

39:33.660 --> 39:35.660
Norwegian, Danish

39:35.660 --> 39:37.660
Russian, and yes, English

39:37.660 --> 39:39.660
We need to get the Animaniacs at this point

39:39.660 --> 39:41.660
There's too many. They gotta come up with like a fucking

39:41.660 --> 39:43.660
I mean I just said, okay, with Babbel

39:43.660 --> 39:45.660
You only need 10 minutes to complete one of their

39:45.660 --> 39:47.660
Bite-sized lessons so that

39:47.660 --> 39:49.660
You can start having real life conversations

39:49.660 --> 39:51.660
In a new language in as little as 3 weeks

39:51.660 --> 39:53.660
Now this is a problem because I did just start

39:53.660 --> 39:55.660
Learning English

39:55.660 --> 39:57.660
Two days ago

39:57.660 --> 39:59.660
Right. So, but by the time

39:59.660 --> 40:01.660
I get back, now other

40:01.660 --> 40:03.660
Language apps use AI

40:03.660 --> 40:05.660
The movie for their

40:05.660 --> 40:07.660
Lesson plans, but Babbel lessons

40:07.660 --> 40:09.660
Were created by over 150 language

40:09.660 --> 40:11.660
Experts. Those are human beings

40:11.660 --> 40:13.660
Not some phony-blowny computer

40:13.660 --> 40:15.660
Brains. Yeah

40:15.660 --> 40:17.660
Fucking Jude Law over here

40:17.660 --> 40:19.660
Just like repeat after Jude

40:19.660 --> 40:21.660
Law. Yeah

40:21.660 --> 40:23.660
You know how Jude Law went around

40:23.660 --> 40:25.660
Telling lonely ladies about language

40:25.660 --> 40:27.660
And stuff? Yeah, man

40:27.660 --> 40:29.660
And it's voiced by real native speakers

40:29.660 --> 40:31.660
Not computers. Who needs them?

40:31.660 --> 40:33.660
With Babbel you can choose from 14

40:33.660 --> 40:35.660
Different languages that I've already listed

Served Great Britain

40:59.660 --> 41:01.660
And the Commonwealth

41:01.660 --> 41:03.660
Loyally for over

41:03.660 --> 41:05.660
70 years

41:05.660 --> 41:07.660
And while, of course, we feel

41:07.660 --> 41:09.660
A profound sadness

41:09.660 --> 41:11.660
We must remember

41:11.660 --> 41:13.660
She lived a long life

41:13.660 --> 41:15.660
And died in such a way that I think

41:15.660 --> 41:17.660
Many of us would want for ourselves

41:17.660 --> 41:19.660
She was at home

41:19.660 --> 41:21.660
Surrounded by her

41:21.660 --> 41:23.660
Family

41:23.660 --> 41:25.660
And, of course, she was listening

41:25.660 --> 41:27.660
To the Beef and Dairy Network

41:27.660 --> 41:29.660
Podcast

41:29.660 --> 41:31.660

41:41.660 --> 41:43.660
You're in a theatre, the lights go down

41:43.660 --> 41:45.660
You're about to get swept up by

41:45.660 --> 41:47.660
The characters and all their little details

41:47.660 --> 41:49.660
And interpersonal dramas

41:49.660 --> 41:51.660
You look at them and think, that person is so obviously

41:51.660 --> 41:53.660
In love with their best friend

41:53.660 --> 41:55.660
Wait, am I in love with my best friend?

41:55.660 --> 41:57.660
That character's mom is so overbearing

41:57.660 --> 41:59.660
Why doesn't she just stand up to her? Oh God, do I need

41:59.660 --> 42:01.660
To stand up to my own mother?

42:01.660 --> 42:03.660
If you've ever recognized yourself in a movie, then join me

Jordan Cruciola for the podcast

42:05.660 --> 42:07.660
Feeling Seen

42:07.660 --> 42:09.660
We've talked to author Susan Orlean on realizing

42:09.660 --> 42:11.660
Her own marriage was falling apart after watching

42:11.660 --> 42:13.660
Adaptation, an adaptation of

42:13.660 --> 42:15.660
Her own work, and comedian

42:15.660 --> 42:17.660
Hari Kondabolu on why Harold and Kumar

42:17.660 --> 42:19.660
Was a depressingly important movie

42:19.660 --> 42:21.660
For Southeast Asians

42:21.660 --> 42:23.660
So join me every Thursday for the Feeling

42:23.660 --> 42:25.660
Seen podcast here on Maximum

42:25.660 --> 42:27.660
Fun

42:29.660 --> 42:31.660
Dun dun dun dun

42:31.660 --> 42:33.660
I really thought we were going to do a second question

42:33.660 --> 42:35.660
That's okay, we'll get there maybe one day

42:35.660 --> 42:37.660
No, I'm doing

42:37.660 --> 42:39.660
The second question now

42:39.660 --> 42:41.660
Oh, that's how it is?

42:41.660 --> 42:43.660
Just a little flourish for it? Nope

42:43.660 --> 42:45.660
Now we're doing the second question

42:45.660 --> 42:47.660
Maybe I'll change my mind

42:47.660 --> 42:49.660
Now I have to think about it

42:49.660 --> 42:51.660
My six year old son recently discovered Pokemon

42:51.660 --> 42:53.660
Hell he is

42:53.660 --> 42:55.660
And is obsessed

42:55.660 --> 42:57.660
My husband and I know nothing about the cards, the game

42:57.660 --> 42:59.660
Or the universe

42:59.660 --> 43:01.660
The headspace, the experience

43:01.660 --> 43:03.660
The lifestyle

43:03.660 --> 43:05.660
The lifestyle

43:05.660 --> 43:07.660
The agenda

43:07.660 --> 43:09.660
If I may be so bold

43:09.660 --> 43:11.660
Recently my son got a

43:11.660 --> 43:13.660
Mewtwo

43:13.660 --> 43:15.660
Griffin

43:15.660 --> 43:17.660
Mewtwo

43:17.660 --> 43:19.660
V-star

43:19.660 --> 43:21.660
Rainbow

43:21.660 --> 43:23.660
In a pack

43:23.660 --> 43:25.660
Oh, fuck

43:25.660 --> 43:27.660
Oh, man

43:27.660 --> 43:29.660
Our Googling says it's a pretty valuable card

43:29.660 --> 43:31.660
Yeah, that's putting it lightly

43:31.660 --> 43:33.660
It's

43:33.660 --> 43:35.660
Powered chart, sir

43:35.660 --> 43:37.660
The thing is, he's six and he's mostly

43:37.660 --> 43:39.660
Into the game for the trades

43:39.660 --> 43:41.660
If we let him keep this card, he will trade it

43:41.660 --> 43:43.660
For Lord knows what

43:43.660 --> 43:45.660
What's the protocol here? Let him make his deals

43:45.660 --> 43:47.660
Protect him from older

43:47.660 --> 43:49.660
Kids taking advantage

43:49.660 --> 43:51.660
Sell the card now and buy him a bunch of other packs

43:51.660 --> 43:53.660
Of cards with the proceeds

43:53.660 --> 43:55.660
That's from Poké Perplexed in Pittsburgh

43:55.660 --> 43:57.660
You've come to the right place

43:57.660 --> 43:59.660
Indeed

43:59.660 --> 44:01.660
The economy

44:01.660 --> 44:03.660
Is fueled

44:03.660 --> 44:05.660
By

44:05.660 --> 44:07.660
Suckers

44:07.660 --> 44:09.660
And it's that there's a circle of life

44:09.660 --> 44:11.660
Around this whole thing

44:11.660 --> 44:13.660
You are correct

44:13.660 --> 44:15.660
In that if you do not intervene

44:15.660 --> 44:17.660
One day, your son's gonna leave

44:17.660 --> 44:19.660
The house with a Mewtwo

44:19.660 --> 44:21.660
V-star Rainbow worth

44:21.660 --> 44:23.660
Now Hawkeye's gonna swoop down, take it

44:23.660 --> 44:25.660
Put it in its nest

44:25.660 --> 44:27.660
Put it in its nest

44:27.660 --> 44:29.660
According to the

44:29.660 --> 44:31.660
I mean, the recent

44:31.660 --> 44:33.660
Sort of like

44:33.660 --> 44:35.660
Pokemon trades that I've

44:35.660 --> 44:37.660
Been reading, it values that one

44:37.660 --> 44:39.660
At about $5500

44:39.660 --> 44:41.660
If he leaves the house with it

44:41.660 --> 44:43.660
He's gonna come back with a fucking scratched up

44:43.660 --> 44:45.660
Moldy ass Dewgong

44:45.660 --> 44:47.660
With a fucking bent ass

44:47.660 --> 44:49.660
Corners and people have written

44:49.660 --> 44:51.660
Like custom attacks with marker

44:51.660 --> 44:53.660
On it, like one water

44:53.660 --> 44:55.660
Energy, 150 damage

44:55.660 --> 44:57.660
And this always hits, like

44:57.660 --> 44:59.660
Fucking like

44:59.660 --> 45:01.660
Your nev- your dumbass

45:01.660 --> 45:03.660
Friend's nephew Kyle

45:03.660 --> 45:05.660
Is just gonna like walk away

45:05.660 --> 45:07.660
Whistling $5500 richer

45:07.660 --> 45:09.660
I congratulate you

45:09.660 --> 45:11.660
On having the clarity of mind

45:11.660 --> 45:13.660
As a parent to look at your 6 year old

45:13.660 --> 45:15.660
Child and say like, hey this kid's

45:15.660 --> 45:17.660
A rube, I mean look at this kid

45:17.660 --> 45:19.660
He's 100%, he's got mark written

45:19.660 --> 45:21.660
All over him, I did my best

45:21.660 --> 45:23.660
But I raised an absolute maroon

45:23.660 --> 45:25.660
This guy's absolute

45:25.660 --> 45:27.660
And listen, I love that he's so wide eyed

45:27.660 --> 45:29.660
And open to the world, but this kid's gonna get

45:29.660 --> 45:31.660
Taken to the fucking cleaners

45:31.660 --> 45:33.660
And Kyle's gonna

45:33.660 --> 45:35.660
Have a little

45:35.660 --> 45:37.660
Little nice day for himself, you know what I mean?

45:37.660 --> 45:39.660
Like it's a service that your

45:39.660 --> 45:41.660
Son is providing to Kyle

45:41.660 --> 45:43.660
I was the

45:43.660 --> 45:45.660
I both gave away

45:45.660 --> 45:47.660
Some real beauties

45:47.660 --> 45:49.660
And also benefited

45:49.660 --> 45:51.660
From some real

45:51.660 --> 45:53.660
Some real dummies, and that's

45:53.660 --> 45:55.660
But that's the way of things, isn't it?

45:55.660 --> 45:57.660
Griff's been the Kyle, and he's been

45:57.660 --> 45:59.660
Your child. I've been the Kyle, I've been

45:59.660 --> 46:01.660
Your child, I've been all over this

46:01.660 --> 46:03.660
Great world of ours. But he's never been

46:03.660 --> 46:05.660
To me. That's the

46:05.660 --> 46:07.660
I've never been, I've never visited

46:07.660 --> 46:09.660
It, Justin. Even once.

46:09.660 --> 46:11.660
No, Griffin, he's never been

46:11.660 --> 46:13.660
To Maine.

46:13.660 --> 46:15.660
You've never been to Maine.

46:15.660 --> 46:17.660
I have never been to Maine. No, we

46:17.660 --> 46:19.660
Went to Maine, didn't we? Doesn't it feel like

46:19.660 --> 46:21.660
We should've gone to Maine by now? Foxwood, is it Foxwood?

46:21.660 --> 46:23.660
No, Foxwood's not Maine. Foxwood's somewhere else.

46:23.660 --> 46:25.660
No, no, no, it's Massachusetts, I think.

46:25.660 --> 46:27.660
So...

46:27.660 --> 46:29.660
The answer's simple, you let him make the trade

46:29.660 --> 46:31.660
To shitty Kyle, and then

46:31.660 --> 46:33.660
You bump into Kyle as he walks away

46:33.660 --> 46:35.660
And he's like, ha, another great deal

46:35.660 --> 46:37.660
Just to check his pockets. What? The card's gone.

46:37.660 --> 46:39.660
That's right. You got it.

46:39.660 --> 46:41.660
Because you've been taking pickpocket classes at the Y.

46:41.660 --> 46:43.660
Yeah, and child

46:43.660 --> 46:45.660
Child pockets are the toughest ones

46:45.660 --> 46:47.660
To pick. So little. So tiny.

46:47.660 --> 46:49.660
So little. So you did have to, you had to study for a couple

46:49.660 --> 46:51.660
Years to get good at it. Luckily

46:51.660 --> 46:53.660
You saw this coming a mile away because of

46:53.660 --> 46:55.660
Your son's

46:55.660 --> 46:57.660
Easygoing demeanor. And you looked

46:57.660 --> 46:59.660
At him when he was three, and you were like, someday

46:59.660 --> 47:01.660
This kid's gonna get taken to the cleaners, so I better start

47:01.660 --> 47:03.660
Pickpocketing now? Long con.

47:03.660 --> 47:05.660
I think. Oh, wow.

47:05.660 --> 47:07.660
Hold on, wait, let's hear Justin out.

47:07.660 --> 47:09.660
No, I just meant, it's the long grif.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.660
Like, you've been planning for a long time

47:11.660 --> 47:13.660
To rob this kid. Yeah.

47:13.660 --> 47:15.660
Whenever Kyle, whoever Kyle ended up being

47:15.660 --> 47:17.660
Yeah. The deck was stacked against you

47:17.660 --> 47:19.660
From the beginning. Yeah.

47:19.660 --> 47:21.660
Kyle thought he was in charge? No, no, no.

47:21.660 --> 47:23.660
No, no, no. You're the director of this little play.

47:23.660 --> 47:25.660
Now, I was... Kyle is

47:25.660 --> 47:27.660
Really your puppet. Yes.

47:27.660 --> 47:29.660
And this is all to teach

47:29.660 --> 47:31.660
You are just so,

47:31.660 --> 47:33.660
So naive son of last night.

47:33.660 --> 47:35.660
I think, you know,

47:35.660 --> 47:37.660
My kid's almost six, and if I said

47:37.660 --> 47:39.660
If you give me this, I can

47:39.660 --> 47:41.660
Then turn it into a lot more

47:41.660 --> 47:43.660
Of the things you like.

47:43.660 --> 47:45.660
That feels like a slam dunk explanation.

47:45.660 --> 47:47.660
Okay. Right? That if I say

47:47.660 --> 47:49.660
This one card,

47:49.660 --> 47:51.660
I could use this to buy you many, many

47:51.660 --> 47:53.660
Packs of cards.

47:53.660 --> 47:55.660
Wow. Right? Like, that feels like something that kid

47:55.660 --> 47:57.660
Would be way into. Right?

47:57.660 --> 47:59.660
Yeah, you can also just take a picture

47:59.660 --> 48:01.660
Of the card, and let him carry the picture around.

48:01.660 --> 48:03.660
There you go.

48:03.660 --> 48:05.660
Cut it out.

48:05.660 --> 48:07.660
You can have a bunch of those, you know what I mean?

48:07.660 --> 48:09.660
You can just trade those to Kyle.

48:09.660 --> 48:11.660
Sell the card, buy a laminator,

48:11.660 --> 48:13.660
Print it out, make a new card.

48:13.660 --> 48:15.660
You know, there's nothing illegal about making

48:15.660 --> 48:17.660
Your own fake Pokemon cards and selling them.

48:17.660 --> 48:19.660
Yeah. It's not illegal.

48:19.660 --> 48:21.660
There's no one, it's not legal fucking Tinder.

48:21.660 --> 48:23.660
It's not money, yeah.

48:23.660 --> 48:25.660
What are they gonna get you on?

48:25.660 --> 48:27.660
Counterfeiting? Come on.

48:27.660 --> 48:29.660
Take their granola bars,

48:29.660 --> 48:31.660
Sell the fake cards.

48:31.660 --> 48:33.660
This is America, baby.

48:33.660 --> 48:35.660
Cause that's good, cause sometimes you have an idea

48:35.660 --> 48:37.660
Like, what if there was an even smaller Pikachu

48:37.660 --> 48:39.660
Named Squeakachoo, and then you can

48:39.660 --> 48:41.660
Make him. You can make him

48:41.660 --> 48:43.660
Be real with a printer

48:43.660 --> 48:45.660
And a laminator.

48:45.660 --> 48:47.660
And he's got

48:47.660 --> 48:49.660
An attack that costs no energy.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.660
It does 300 damage.

48:51.660 --> 48:53.660
And ruin someone's credit score.

48:53.660 --> 48:55.660
And if it's a

48:55.660 --> 48:57.660
A card game, then it's not fan fiction.

48:57.660 --> 48:59.660
It's a mod.

48:59.660 --> 49:01.660
There you go. Oh, this is DLC.

49:03.660 --> 49:05.660
This isn't Velma and Shaggy

49:05.660 --> 49:07.660
Kissing. This is an expansion

49:07.660 --> 49:09.660
On the

49:09.660 --> 49:11.660
Velma and Shaggy universe.

49:11.660 --> 49:13.660
A modification. An upgrade.

49:13.660 --> 49:15.660
If you will.

49:15.660 --> 49:17.660
Also, I gave Shaggy

49:17.660 --> 49:19.660
Big pecs. Cause I love that.

49:19.660 --> 49:21.660
I like his shaggy pecs.

49:21.660 --> 49:23.660
Could we do a

49:23.660 --> 49:25.660
Shirt. Do you think we could sell a shirt

49:25.660 --> 49:27.660
With a strong Shaggy on it?

49:27.660 --> 49:29.660
It's like, strong Shaggy?

49:29.660 --> 49:31.660
No, cause it's like

49:31.660 --> 49:33.660
I think it's a meme. I think actually

49:33.660 --> 49:35.660
Strong Shaggy is a meme.

49:35.660 --> 49:37.660
Like, for whatever reason

49:37.660 --> 49:39.660
Kids like

49:39.660 --> 49:41.660
Shaggy if he was really strong.

49:41.660 --> 49:43.660
I don't know why, but this guy keeps

49:43.660 --> 49:45.660
Popping up in my YouTube videos. And every time

49:45.660 --> 49:47.660
I see him being very strong and

49:47.660 --> 49:49.660
Beating up Huggy Wuggy or any of the other

49:49.660 --> 49:51.660
Sort of fucking video game

49:51.660 --> 49:53.660
Degenerates.

49:53.660 --> 49:55.660
And the kids go crazy. And it's like

49:55.660 --> 49:57.660
That dude is high

49:57.660 --> 49:59.660
On drugs. He is

49:59.660 --> 50:01.660
Casey Kasem. He has no friends.

50:01.660 --> 50:03.660
He eats dog food. Steals people's

50:03.660 --> 50:05.660
Sandwiches. Steals people's sandwiches. Please

50:05.660 --> 50:07.660
Do not aspire to be this man.

50:07.660 --> 50:09.660
He has wasted his potential.

50:09.660 --> 50:11.660
What if we made a t-shirt that was just

50:11.660 --> 50:13.660
A series of pictures of like

50:13.660 --> 50:15.660
Shaggy on a sofa. Shaggy on a

50:15.660 --> 50:17.660
Counter. Shaggy in the

50:17.660 --> 50:19.660
Shower. Shaggy being caught on

50:19.660 --> 50:21.660
Camera. What do you think?

50:21.660 --> 50:23.660
In the shower? Yeah.

50:23.660 --> 50:25.660
But we saw him in the

50:25.660 --> 50:27.660
Shower. It wasn't me.

50:27.660 --> 50:29.660
Oh, okay.

50:29.660 --> 50:31.660
Because he's Shaggy, right? But he's on the sofa.

50:31.660 --> 50:33.660
No, I get the joke now.

50:33.660 --> 50:35.660
I guess in my mind when I heard

50:35.660 --> 50:37.660
You say let's do a t-shirt

50:37.660 --> 50:39.660
With a nude cartoon

50:39.660 --> 50:41.660
Character license. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:41.660 --> 50:43.660
And I should note this isn't like a joke. This is a separate

50:43.660 --> 50:45.660
Business I want to start where we are selling these

50:45.660 --> 50:47.660
Like a hot topic or something. I think that these

50:47.660 --> 50:49.660
Would actually do really well in that market.

50:49.660 --> 50:51.660
Not as like a McElroy Brothers joke

50:51.660 --> 50:53.660
Thing, but to like branch out into

50:53.660 --> 50:55.660
Actual like more like memetic

50:55.660 --> 50:57.660
T-shirts. You couldn't sell it at

50:57.660 --> 50:59.660
A hot topic. You could sell it at

50:59.660 --> 51:01.660
A kiosk outside

51:01.660 --> 51:03.660
Of the hot topic because as far as I can

51:03.660 --> 51:05.660
Tell from mall kiosks

51:05.660 --> 51:07.660
Anything fucking goes.

51:07.660 --> 51:09.660
Anything goes. You can have Shaggy's

51:09.660 --> 51:11.660
Dong fully on display in the shower.

51:11.660 --> 51:13.660
You fully, fully can.

51:13.660 --> 51:15.660
It's like international waters if you're in the

51:15.660 --> 51:17.660
Mall hallways. Yeah, we've got

51:17.660 --> 51:19.660
Shaggy nude on t-shirts

51:19.660 --> 51:21.660
And Pelotons. Come on in.

51:23.660 --> 51:25.660
This just says Pelican-ton.

51:25.660 --> 51:27.660
Yeah, it's my version of it

51:27.660 --> 51:29.660
Where you're riding the bike and there's a

51:29.660 --> 51:31.660
Video behind you of a Pelican

51:31.660 --> 51:33.660
Chasing you. It's an

51:33.660 --> 51:35.660
Expansion to the Peloton.

51:35.660 --> 51:37.660
It's not a rip-off. It's an expansion.

51:37.660 --> 51:39.660
I trademarked it myself. I wrote

51:39.660 --> 51:41.660
The idea on a piece of paper and I mailed it to myself

51:41.660 --> 51:43.660
And I haven't opened it. So see you in court.

51:43.660 --> 51:45.660
This is legally binding.

51:45.660 --> 51:47.660
My neighbor recently removed the hedge on their side of the fence

51:47.660 --> 51:49.660
Between our properties. This fence

51:49.660 --> 51:51.660
Is around two feet from my house and it's not very

51:51.660 --> 51:53.660
Tall. This means that the neighbors now have

51:53.660 --> 51:55.660
An unobstructed view through my window into

51:55.660 --> 51:57.660
My bed. Even though I keep the blinds

51:57.660 --> 51:59.660
Low, I still prefer to keep a fan in the window.

51:59.660 --> 52:01.660
Which requires them to be

52:01.660 --> 52:03.660
Open far enough that I'm certain my neighbors

52:03.660 --> 52:05.660
Will have a line of sight from their windows straight to my

52:05.660 --> 52:07.660
Junk. Am I

52:07.660 --> 52:09.660
Still good to sleep in the nude?

52:09.660 --> 52:11.660
Should I let their

52:11.660 --> 52:13.660
Decisions to remove the privacy hedge decide

52:13.660 --> 52:15.660
How I dress at night? Or do I give

52:15.660 --> 52:17.660
This provenly nosy

52:17.660 --> 52:19.660
Neighbor an eyeful in hopes she

52:19.660 --> 52:21.660
Plants a new privacy bush?

52:21.660 --> 52:23.660
That's from bedtime

52:23.660 --> 52:25.660
Bush in Bremerton.

52:25.660 --> 52:27.660
You

52:27.660 --> 52:29.660
Chose to use the word bush.

52:29.660 --> 52:31.660
You chose it. You chose

52:31.660 --> 52:33.660
It. You could have said something else.

52:33.660 --> 52:35.660
But you didn't.

52:37.660 --> 52:39.660
This feels tricky

52:39.660 --> 52:41.660
To me. Oh, it does?

52:41.660 --> 52:43.660
Feels fraught. Travis,

52:43.660 --> 52:45.660
Don't just- Travis, tell me what they should

52:45.660 --> 52:47.660
Do and don't just say, plant another

52:47.660 --> 52:49.660
Taller bush next to their bush.

52:49.660 --> 52:51.660
No, it just- it strikes me as like

52:51.660 --> 52:53.660
Um, I

52:53.660 --> 52:55.660
If you are not bothered

52:55.660 --> 52:57.660
By it, right? If you're not like,

52:57.660 --> 52:59.660
Oh no, what do I do now? If it's

52:59.660 --> 53:01.660
Just like, well, you made some decisions

53:01.660 --> 53:03.660
And this is where your choices

53:03.660 --> 53:05.660
Have brought you, I will

53:05.660 --> 53:07.660
Continue on my momentum

53:07.660 --> 53:09.660
Like, unless

53:09.660 --> 53:11.660
Acted upon by an outside force.

53:11.660 --> 53:13.660
You know what I mean?

53:13.660 --> 53:15.660
There are two different kinds of naked.

53:15.660 --> 53:17.660
You don't have clothes on

53:17.660 --> 53:19.660
And you're worried there's

53:19.660 --> 53:21.660
Any chance on

53:21.660 --> 53:23.660
Earth someone might see you.

53:23.660 --> 53:25.660
Or, there's the

53:25.660 --> 53:27.660
Times when you're naked and you're just like

53:27.660 --> 53:29.660
You. That's who you are.

53:29.660 --> 53:31.660
You're in your body.

53:31.660 --> 53:33.660
You're feeling you're sexy.

53:33.660 --> 53:35.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're saying

53:35.660 --> 53:37.660
Thank you, monster god, for my rock and bod.

53:37.660 --> 53:39.660
Thank you, monster god, for my rock and bod.

53:39.660 --> 53:41.660
And, this

53:41.660 --> 53:43.660
Person is never going to be able

53:43.660 --> 53:45.660
To get into that second head

53:45.660 --> 53:47.660
Space. Right. Because

53:47.660 --> 53:49.660
There's always the possibility

53:49.660 --> 53:51.660
That you could be being perused.

53:51.660 --> 53:53.660
It's not about the neighbor, it's about

53:53.660 --> 53:55.660
You. You need to be able to be

53:55.660 --> 53:57.660
Not just nude, but indescribably

53:57.660 --> 53:59.660
Perfectly nude.

53:59.660 --> 54:01.660
Deeply. A nude soul

54:01.660 --> 54:03.660
As well, if you will. Yes.

54:03.660 --> 54:05.660
Emotionally nude.

54:05.660 --> 54:07.660
Okay.

54:07.660 --> 54:09.660
So what do you do then, Justin?

54:09.660 --> 54:11.660
You plan a second taller

54:11.660 --> 54:13.660
Book. Okay, now hold on. I was explicitly told

54:13.660 --> 54:15.660
I just didn't want you

54:15.660 --> 54:17.660
To take mine. Oh, okay.

54:17.660 --> 54:19.660
I didn't

54:19.660 --> 54:21.660
Know we could do that. We've been doing this show for over

54:21.660 --> 54:23.660
A decade. I know. I didn't know we could say like

54:23.660 --> 54:25.660
And I called dibs on this answer.

54:25.660 --> 54:27.660
I just came up with it. I was like, I don't

54:27.660 --> 54:29.660
Want to interrupt him. I'll just put a bookmark

54:29.660 --> 54:31.660
In so he doesn't take mine.

54:31.660 --> 54:33.660
So good, dude.

54:33.660 --> 54:35.660
If I was going to invent that rule

54:35.660 --> 54:37.660
I wish I had done it for

54:37.660 --> 54:39.660
I was about to say better joke, but like odd joke.

54:39.660 --> 54:41.660
You know what I mean?

54:41.660 --> 54:43.660
The idea you get.

54:43.660 --> 54:45.660
Are any of us truly nude in the dark?

54:45.660 --> 54:47.660
Huh.

54:47.660 --> 54:49.660
If you're in the dark, in the darkness, and no one can

54:49.660 --> 54:51.660
See your privacy

54:51.660 --> 54:53.660
Are you

54:53.660 --> 54:55.660
Even nude?

54:55.660 --> 54:57.660
Huh.

54:57.660 --> 54:59.660
Do you think when the darkness

54:59.660 --> 55:01.660
Is in the green room, anyone ever leaned

55:01.660 --> 55:03.660
In and just like shut off the lights

55:03.660 --> 55:05.660
Real quick and slammed the door and the

55:05.660 --> 55:07.660
Band's like, oh, here we go again.

55:07.660 --> 55:09.660
Yeah, sure.

55:09.660 --> 55:11.660
So there's always a joker. Is it there?

55:11.660 --> 55:13.660
Yeah, for sure.

55:13.660 --> 55:15.660
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

55:15.660 --> 55:17.660
I'm sorry

55:17.660 --> 55:19.660
That my brothers denied you that

55:19.660 --> 55:21.660
Wonderful Munch

55:21.660 --> 55:23.660
Squad. I was definitely really, really

55:23.660 --> 55:25.660
Going to do. Save it.

55:25.660 --> 55:27.660
Do two next time.

55:27.660 --> 55:29.660
But, you know, I hope you had fun regardless.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.660
That's all we, that's all we ever

55:31.660 --> 55:33.660
Hope for you. Enjoy yourself.

55:33.660 --> 55:35.660
Is that all?

55:35.660 --> 55:37.660
Wait, is that all we ever hope for?

55:37.660 --> 55:39.660
That's all we ever hope for.

55:39.660 --> 55:41.660
Oh, man. Okay. I'm learning so much on this episode.

55:41.660 --> 55:43.660
Maybe would it kill you to buy a shirt from time to time.

55:43.660 --> 55:45.660
You know what I mean?

55:45.660 --> 55:47.660
There we go. There it is.

55:47.660 --> 55:49.660
Maybe a deluxe blanket.

55:49.660 --> 55:51.660
Speaking of that, Justin, it's so funny you should make that.

55:51.660 --> 55:53.660
What?

55:53.660 --> 55:55.660
We have a Garrow blanket on sale in the merch store

55:55.660 --> 55:57.660
For the very, very esque

55:57.660 --> 55:59.660
Garrow blanket over at MacroMerch.com

55:59.660 --> 56:01.660
We've also got our Candle Nights wrapping paper back

56:01.660 --> 56:03.660
Designed by Justin Gray

56:03.660 --> 56:05.660
And 10% of all merch proceeds this month

56:05.660 --> 56:07.660
Go to Fair Elections Center

56:07.660 --> 56:09.660
And listen, it's not just that. It's all the other merch there.

56:09.660 --> 56:11.660
And it's time to start thinking about that

56:11.660 --> 56:13.660
Holiday season.

56:13.660 --> 56:15.660
It's creeping in. I feel it.

56:15.660 --> 56:17.660
I feel that creep.

56:17.660 --> 56:19.660
My children have now each gotten a Garrow.

56:19.660 --> 56:21.660
The Garrow stuffy. Same.

56:21.660 --> 56:23.660
They are really enjoying talking

56:23.660 --> 56:25.660
To each other

56:25.660 --> 56:27.660
And then constantly forgetting

56:27.660 --> 56:29.660
That he's a Binocorn, which is fun.

56:29.660 --> 56:31.660
They keep calling him a Rhinocorn

56:31.660 --> 56:33.660
Which I enjoy immensely.

56:33.660 --> 56:35.660
Let's explore that.

56:35.660 --> 56:37.660
I mean, a Rhino is already kind of a Rhinocorn.

56:37.660 --> 56:39.660
Exactly.

56:39.660 --> 56:41.660
But imagine if you said, this is a unicorn

56:41.660 --> 56:43.660
Except it looks like a Rhino.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.660
Yeah, sure.

56:45.660 --> 56:47.660
This is going to be a thanks from Montaigne.

56:47.660 --> 56:49.660
Thanks, Montaigne, for the use of our theme song

56:49.660 --> 56:51.660
My life is better with you.

56:51.660 --> 56:53.660
It makes you stronger to cure it.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.660
That's true.

56:55.660 --> 56:57.660
And if you have fear

56:57.660 --> 56:59.660
Any fear, any weakness

56:59.660 --> 57:01.660
The song makes it go away.

57:01.660 --> 57:03.660
Oh.

57:03.660 --> 57:05.660
Yeah, in the scariest times

57:05.660 --> 57:07.660
The song makes you strong enough to face it.

57:07.660 --> 57:09.660
Wow. That's cool.

57:09.660 --> 57:11.660
How do they do that?

57:11.660 --> 57:13.660
Is it like a binaural?

57:13.660 --> 57:15.660
Or like a subconscious thing?

57:15.660 --> 57:17.660
Yes, both of them.

57:17.660 --> 57:19.660
That's amazing.

57:19.660 --> 57:21.660
On the tour front

57:21.660 --> 57:23.660
The shows in San Jose and Denver

57:23.660 --> 57:25.660

We will be selling those tickets

57:57.660 --> 57:59.660
You can get those on sale now

57:59.660 --> 58:01.660
Travis promises that he won't get COVID this time.

58:01.660 --> 58:03.660
Promise.

58:03.660 --> 58:05.660
Cross my lungs.

58:05.660 --> 58:07.660
November shows in Washington DC

58:07.660 --> 58:09.660
With Brendan Lee Mulligan

58:09.660 --> 58:11.660

58:29.660 --> 58:31.660
Yep. That's it.

58:31.660 --> 58:33.660
Everybody stick to your guns.

58:33.660 --> 58:35.660
I'll do it. I feel like I didn't contribute much this week.

58:35.660 --> 58:37.660
Stick to your guns.

58:37.660 --> 58:39.660
No, that's not what we went with. We had something different.

58:39.660 --> 58:41.660
What was our new thing?

58:41.660 --> 58:43.660
I think it was whoever didn't contribute the most tested.

58:43.660 --> 58:45.660
We just rolled that out fairly wisely.

58:45.660 --> 58:47.660
Then we had a new thing.

58:47.660 --> 58:49.660
I don't know.

58:49.660 --> 58:51.660
I don't know but it's also from a future episode for the Halloween special.

58:51.660 --> 58:53.660
I don't think people have heard yet.

58:53.660 --> 58:55.660
Okay, well then I'll just say that

58:55.660 --> 58:57.660
Let me do it anyway.

58:57.660 --> 58:59.660
Okay.

58:59.660 --> 59:01.660
Because I have to go in 30 seconds.

59:01.660 --> 59:03.660
Don't ever compromise.

59:03.660 --> 59:05.660
For any reason.

59:05.660 --> 59:07.660
My name is Justin McElroy.
