00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.360
Hello everybody, welcome to My Brother My Brother, an advice show from the modern era.

00:47.360 --> 00:51.120
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:53.600 --> 01:00.000
Uh, and it's been a big adjustment working from home.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.240
Yep.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.640
Uh, I miss everybody at the office.

01:03.520 --> 01:03.920
Oh yeah.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.720
Aw, sure dude, Stan Lee.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.200
Did you say Dan Lee?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.240
Stan Lee.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.680
Stan Lee, okay.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.080
Stan Lee.

01:12.080 --> 01:12.800
Stan Lee.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.880
Uh, fucking Dwight, dude.

01:16.880 --> 01:21.280
I d- wait, hold on. Is this isolation, or did we talk about the office last week?

01:21.280 --> 01:23.040
I feel like we did that again last week.

01:23.040 --> 01:28.720
Pan, fucking gin, fucking-

01:28.720 --> 01:30.400
Okay, wait, let me hit you with something.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.040
Swites.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.320
I want to hit you with a fantasy. This is a fantasy starter. Okay, everybody.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.040
Here's a prompt for your NaNoWriMo. Just get to going early, right?

01:41.040 --> 01:41.360
Okay.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.760
Pam and Jim.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.320
Uh-huh.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.520
That's something, right?

01:45.520 --> 01:46.080
Yeah.

01:46.080 --> 01:52.320
But if you change both the sounds to in, you got pan and gin, and you're in like a fantasy thing.

01:52.320 --> 01:52.880
Yeah.

01:52.880 --> 02:01.200
Just like that. It's a tale of one of the pantheon of gods and a genie recently freed from a lamp.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.640
Oh, you went a different way. I thought you were saying like some kind of weird children's story

02:04.640 --> 02:10.160
where like a frying pan and I guess a bottle of gin worked together and like ran away with

02:10.160 --> 02:11.200
the spoon kind of thing.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.920
See, that's where I went with it too. And I, you know me, I live in Austin and I haven't been able

02:15.920 --> 02:24.240
to get out to all of my favorite cocktail raceries, some of my favorite mixing labs that a lot of the

02:24.240 --> 02:31.200
mixologists down here have been whipping up for me with their lavender smokes and scented orbs

02:31.200 --> 02:34.720
and shit like that. And so I thought you were giving me the hot new cocktail of the spring

02:34.720 --> 02:40.480
Justin, which is that you pour gin in a pan and make it, get it hot. And now we're talking about

02:40.480 --> 02:41.440
hot gin?

02:41.440 --> 02:43.040
Hot gin, delicious.

02:43.040 --> 02:48.400
Hot, hot detoxified gin. That is some sterile gin right there.

02:48.400 --> 02:53.040
I burn all the alcohol out of that gin before I drink it. I just want the good flavor of that

02:53.040 --> 02:53.680
gin with no-

02:53.680 --> 02:56.080
I just want the flavor of hot gin.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.240
I just want that to burn me.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.920
Hey guys, is this anything? Is this a cocktail? Gin and Sonic.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.120
Is that a cocktail?

03:03.120 --> 03:08.000
So that could be something. By the way, is this intro anything so far? Because we've

03:08.000 --> 03:09.680
tried about six different things in four minutes.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.960
Yeah, we'll get there. What do you guys think? I think gin and Sonic is a

03:12.960 --> 03:15.120
gin and like blue curacao.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.280
Or you just watched the Sonic the Hedgehog movie now on demand.

03:20.320 --> 03:20.800
Featuring-

03:21.600 --> 03:25.040
Now this is interesting. Okay, Griffin, let's talk about this fucking heel turn.

03:26.400 --> 03:31.200
Because this is a behind the scenes heel turn for everybody. We told Griffin we should do a

03:31.200 --> 03:37.200
Sonic watch about the release of Sonic. He quickly poo-pooed it. And now Griffin has taken us down

03:37.200 --> 03:42.240
some back roads and removed the blindfolds to find that we are at Sonic's house.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.600
And he has driven us there.

03:43.600 --> 03:49.440
Here's the thing, Juice. You offered me- I was falling. Falling down the big tree. I fell off

03:49.440 --> 03:52.960
the branches of the big tree where I was having a monkey party up top, right?

03:52.960 --> 03:53.360
Yeah.

03:53.360 --> 03:59.920
And I fell down trying to reach a big coconut and I was falling. And then you two apes were like,

03:59.920 --> 04:04.960
hey Griffin, here's a vine and it's Sonic the Hedgehog now on video on demand. Watch it,

04:04.960 --> 04:06.160
catch it live.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.520
Yes, but boys, to follow-

04:07.520 --> 04:08.960
Please let me finish.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.880
Just let him play. Please let him finish.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.880
I saw that. I said, there's so many reasons not to grab that vine. I already did watch it. It's

04:14.880 --> 04:18.880
an old movie. There's no way to make jokes about it anymore. People have done all the jokes. And

04:18.880 --> 04:22.800
also there's a movie coming out next week on demand that I really want people to see so I

04:22.800 --> 04:27.360
don't want them to burn their movie budget. But then I said poo-poo to that vine and I kept falling.

04:27.360 --> 04:32.880
And then some more rotten ass vines came along. Rotten ass vines. Like here's how to make a hot

04:32.880 --> 04:37.120
gin and here's the office, but fantasy. And now I'm looking up that Sonic vine. I'm like,

04:37.120 --> 04:43.600
oh, that looks pretty fucked. It looks like that one can have a lot of tension on it,

04:43.600 --> 04:46.160
that it will hold up my weight and keep me alive.

04:46.160 --> 04:50.240
But here's the problem Griffin, to continue Justin's metaphor, not only did you drive us

04:50.240 --> 04:55.280
to Sonic's house, but it was like I said, Sonic's having a birthday party, let's go.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.640
And you said, I don't want to go to Sonic's birthday party. And I said, okay. So I didn't

04:58.640 --> 05:02.880
buy him a present. And then I get out of the car and you're like, we're at Sonic's birthday party

05:02.880 --> 05:07.200
and I brought a present. And now Justin and I look like fucking assholes because we didn't bring any

05:07.200 --> 05:12.160
presents for Sonic and you brought the present. Yeah, but now it's like we've all walked into

05:12.160 --> 05:15.840
the party and you two are yelling about how you didn't get presents for Sonic, isn't it?

05:15.840 --> 05:18.400
Well, can we say that your present is from all of us?

05:18.400 --> 05:20.880
Yeah, sure. Why not? Hey, Sonic. Hey guys, it's me,

05:20.880 --> 05:26.080
Sonic. I'm so stoked you could make it to my bash. Hey, Sonic. It's good to be out.

05:26.080 --> 05:31.360
I'm glad that we broke the quarantine protocols for this Sonic the Hedgehog's birthday party.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.600
Definitely worth it. Definitely worth it. A big find coming our way. But we did get you

05:36.160 --> 05:41.360
all three of us this present together and we got it. Couldn't go to a store, obviously,

05:41.360 --> 05:45.680
Sonic. So I apologize for that. It was made at home with a lot of love.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.000
I got a text from- Wait, are you still Sonic?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.600
No, no, I'm Justin. I'm telling an anti there to entertain Sonic.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.400
Hold on one second, Sonic. No problem. So-

05:56.400 --> 05:59.360
I'll just be over here talking to my other guests. I'm a good host.

05:59.360 --> 06:03.440
Yeah, make the rounds, bud. I will, but just know that none of them are

06:03.440 --> 06:06.400
as important to me as you are. Thanks, man. That's a good choice.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.640
I mean, Mario's here, but fuck that guy, right? You guys are my true BFF.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.240
By the way, this is the best intro you guys have ever done because you're speeding through

06:14.240 --> 06:18.160
the topic so fast without even paying attention to them or trying to flesh them out. Just like

06:18.160 --> 06:21.360
I run through the city as Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm so proud of you.

06:21.360 --> 06:27.360
I'm proud of you because you're not focusing on any one thing for more than 25 seconds.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.480
It was almost like we were in the middle of a bit in a skit right there,

06:30.480 --> 06:35.120
and Justin just like fucking saw a butterfly float by and lost interest in it.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.440
That's cool. As a reward for your good comedy,

06:37.440 --> 06:41.120
I'm going to run around and scoop up all the coronavirus to protect you.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.560
You didn't want to come to Sonic's house in the first place, Kermit.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.000
If I run around the world real fast, it'll create a vortex. It's going to suck up all

06:48.000 --> 06:50.640
the coronavirus. I've had the ability to do it this whole time.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.560
But I held it back because you guys weren't doing a good enough intro yet.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.320
But look at you now. My charming stars. I'm so proud of you.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.880
Watch as I zoom around and cure the world.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.280
Kermit, you came here under duress. Come on, Tails. Let's save the McElroy brothers.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.880
That is not Sonic music. Justin, what was your-

07:14.880 --> 07:18.160
Tell us about your fucking text. I got text.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.560
No, I don't even want to do it anymore. No, you have to do it now.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.000
Not at all. Sonic's waiting.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.800
Don't. I don't have to do it. You just butchered Sonic the Hedgehog

07:24.800 --> 07:29.280
on the altar of your supposed joke, and you've slit his throat,

07:29.280 --> 07:33.680
and the blood has run down into the trough, and then Sonic died,

07:33.680 --> 07:36.640
and you look down and you're like, I don't really want to do the sacrifice.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.040
I don't really want to do the Sonic sacrifice anymore.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.760
But he's going to come back, right? No.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.800
Read your fucking text, and we'll see if it's good enough.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.560
I don't want to talk about it anymore. Justin?

07:47.440 --> 07:51.520
No, things got funny. They weren't funny when I was going to do it.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.360
Now it's less funny than what we're doing.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.000
We had a fucking great Sonic the Hedgehog bit.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.280
Like, it got better, but it was good bones.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.920
You didn't want to come to Sonic's house.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.640
But once we got there, Justin, we were there.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.560
Why are you on his side? Why are you on his side?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.480
I'm not. Listen, I'm on nobody's side.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.160
Sonic the Hedgehog's house, okay? We haven't left our own houses in a while.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.120
We're excited to be out and about fucking chilling with our blue friend.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.640
I'm just saying we could have talked about this in Sonic's bedroom.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.320
We could have had a little privacy.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.280
He's just standing there listening to all this, this toe tapping.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.120
Tell me what your text said, or else I'm gonna have Knuckles whip your ass.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.760
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.200
I don't want to talk about it.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.040
Justin, here comes Knuckles. He looks angry.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.280
I'll wait till things get less funny.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.160
And then Knuckles is kind of cracking his, what's the word for it?

08:38.160 --> 08:39.840
Uh, his like, fist bones?

08:41.440 --> 08:42.960
The middle of his hand bones.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.800
You know, his hand bendies? You know, he's popping them.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.480
Not the meat in his hands, but the other stuff.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.880
It's where it kind of like hand corners, you know? Hand hinges.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.760
Why does Tails have to take orders from Sonic? He can fly.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.640
Justin, please read-

09:00.640 --> 09:04.880
If I could fly away from Sonic, I would be the boss.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.240
I would fly straight into his arms.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.560
Yeah, they're in love.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.200
Hold on, let me look on the internet, see if there's a picture of that.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.720
Huh. Oh no, my computer is melting.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.080
Hey, what's a question or the text? I will accept either one.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.320
I don't want to talk.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.240
Read the text, Justin.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.880
Okay, I got a text from some random staffer

09:26.880 --> 09:31.680
who was fundraising for some candidate in Iowa, like yesterday.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.720
And I got this text, and I'm not in Iowa,

09:34.720 --> 09:38.720
so I don't like people straight up just texting me out of nowhere.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.440
So they're like, hey, this is me from this campaign.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.200
How you doing today?

09:43.200 --> 09:47.440
And I said, you know, I'm just getting my house cleaned up

09:47.440 --> 09:49.360
for a big party before all my guests get here.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.520
And then the person responded, yeah, I feel you.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.160
No, I don't know what the proper response should have been.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.720
Probably like, give me your address, I'm calling the cops on you.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.040
Right.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.760
But I did not expect, yeah, I feel you.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.760
Oh, jeez, Sonic's looking up from the blood-soaked glyphs, and he's smiling.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.280
Oh, he liked it.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.920
He's so glad you killed him.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.280
Thank you for killing me, Justin.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.800
Set me free!

10:19.120 --> 10:20.720
To die is the true invention.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.960
Gotta go fast into Christ's ever-loving arms.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.080
Up here, everything's fast.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.520
Jeez, O'Pete.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.760
That's his real name.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.600
Gotta find the questions.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.920
As I work as an editor for, now, okay, can I clarify, Travis?

10:37.920 --> 10:38.160
Yes.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.440
What times?

10:39.440 --> 10:40.560
These are for the current days.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.440
What epoch?

10:41.440 --> 10:47.200
These are, I went out and scooped these up from the blasted wastelands myself.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.560
These are today times, yes.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.060
Yes.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.280
Work as an editor for a publishing company.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.680
The workflow around here is not very steady.

10:55.680 --> 11:00.000
Some days I have lots of pages to check, and other days I have absolutely nothing to do.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.440
This was never a problem in the office, as I'd gotten pretty good pretending to be busy

11:03.440 --> 11:04.720
when my boss walked by.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.960
However, now that we're all quarantined and working from home, I have to send a detailed

11:08.960 --> 11:13.680
report to my boss every day listing the specific projects I worked on.

11:13.680 --> 11:18.400
Brothers, how can I beef up my report so it looks like I'm busy every day when I'm actually

11:18.400 --> 11:20.480
doing fuck all?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.640
That's for misleading in Massachusetts.

11:23.440 --> 11:28.640
It is weird to me that we live in a time, and listen, I believe you, question asker,

11:28.640 --> 11:34.160
but it is weird to me that we live in a time where it was easier to pretend to do nothing

11:34.160 --> 11:41.280
at the office surrounded by other people than in your own home watched by probably only

11:41.280 --> 11:42.000
your Alexa.

11:42.880 --> 11:52.240
Well, it's because there are a lot of folks out there in managerial positions of a lot

11:52.240 --> 11:57.600
of different places that assume that as soon as you leave their line of sight, you are

11:57.600 --> 12:00.720
playing Pokemon Go with all of your friends at the park.

12:00.720 --> 12:07.520
And that's obviously not true, and is a very shitty way to think about your employees.

12:07.520 --> 12:12.320
On the flip side of that, I did dick around pretty much my entire first couple of years

12:12.320 --> 12:13.520
of working from home.

12:13.520 --> 12:18.160
So like, like, yeah, I'm playing Pokemon Go at the park with my friends, but hey, we're

12:18.160 --> 12:20.160
all going through some shit right now.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.400
Yeah, maybe calm down a little bit.

12:22.400 --> 12:27.200
I think that this this question asker is not the only person dealing with this.

12:27.200 --> 12:35.920
Yes, my evidence is your guy has gotten a lot of how can I put this in a non incriminating

12:35.920 --> 12:36.560
fashion?

12:36.560 --> 12:42.560
Your guy has gotten a lot of requests for conference calls in the past couple of weeks

12:42.560 --> 12:47.680
with some of our many friends and partners that maybe your boy didn't necessarily need

12:47.680 --> 12:49.360
to be on a conference call with.

12:49.360 --> 12:54.400
And he has a suspicion that maybe some of our beloved friends and partners are trying

12:54.400 --> 13:01.200
to get a few more few more pips on the old workflow sheet for that and trying to log

13:01.200 --> 13:02.320
a couple of.

13:02.320 --> 13:10.240
Yeah, I did some some brand extension with our man Justin over there, logged a big long

13:10.240 --> 13:10.800
call with him.

13:11.840 --> 13:16.720
What if you just started listing on your list of stuff that you did just like a half hour

13:16.720 --> 13:21.680
where you just went dark when your boss is like, what?

13:21.680 --> 13:22.720
What's that all about?

13:22.720 --> 13:24.640
You say, I wish I could tell you.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.520
That's yeah, 10 a.m. to three p.m.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.560
Michael's private time.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.400
And then it'll be like, what did you do in there?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.960
And be like, can you fucking read?

13:35.680 --> 13:37.200
You don't get to ask me that.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.920
It's Michael's private time.

13:39.920 --> 13:45.600
What about just like you just write like ten to three synergistic planning session?

13:46.400 --> 13:47.520
That's pretty good.

13:47.520 --> 13:47.840
Right.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.200
And I'll be like, what was that?

13:49.200 --> 13:52.160
I was like, I was trying to plan how to do some more synergy.

13:52.160 --> 13:56.960
If you don't know, you're the sorry.

13:56.960 --> 13:57.840
You're the boss.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.320
Yeah, that's weird.

14:00.880 --> 14:01.680
Ten to three.

14:01.680 --> 14:06.960
Watch reruns of who's the boss because I was having a hard time remembering who the boss

14:06.960 --> 14:09.120
was on the flip side.

14:09.120 --> 14:14.800
You can also keep an incredibly detailed log of just like eight.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.920
Eight oh one.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.800
Woke up.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.240
Eight eleven.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.320
Finished my morning bathroom time.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.000
Eight twelve.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.840
Started cooking oatmeal.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.600
It was a Tuesday, Derek.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.240
And then eleven fifty one to eleven fifty four.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.280
Please don't ask me what I did during these three minutes.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.160
Please.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.920
Eight forty five to nine.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.840
Made made oatmeal.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.320
Nine oh one realized burned oatmeal.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.640
Nine oh two started making oatmeal again.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.240
Oh no, out of oatmeal.

14:46.240 --> 14:46.960
What do I do?

14:46.960 --> 14:49.840
Nine oh five to nine oh seven again.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.160
I need a secret.

14:52.160 --> 14:52.880
Please.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.720
Please let it be a secret.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.760
Nine oh seven to nine oh nine again.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.360
Might have just been a continuation of first secret.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.000
Hard to tell.

15:07.680 --> 15:08.800
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

15:08.800 --> 15:09.520
Yeah, I'd love that.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.720
Here's one that was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.280
Thank you, Graham.

15:13.280 --> 15:20.080
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm going to call Limba asks.

15:21.840 --> 15:26.160
When you go to someone's place, what can you learn from their bathroom?

15:27.120 --> 15:27.760
Everything.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.040
Wow.

15:29.680 --> 15:35.360
I think everything's maybe exaggeration, but I think you can learn a great deal.

15:35.360 --> 15:41.360
And I also think as adults, this is the closest we get to when you're a kid and you stay the

15:41.360 --> 15:46.720
night at somebody's house for the first time and in your friendship with them and you like it

15:46.720 --> 15:51.520
fucking parts the veil just like, oh, so that's how you do all this shit.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.880
That's how you do all this stuff.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.760
We've talked about this many times, but it's like Poirot, right?

15:57.760 --> 15:59.680
Where it's all about the psychology, right?

16:00.320 --> 16:03.360
That's what I'm saying is walking into someone's bathroom and seeing,

16:04.080 --> 16:08.560
like putting yourself in their head where it's like, oh, you had to get that close.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.760
Like you put this there so you could reach it from here.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.400
Now I know what type of person you are, right?

16:14.400 --> 16:19.120
Like if you come into my restroom, I don't want to brag, but I have two extra rolls of

16:19.120 --> 16:22.080
toilet paper in there because you are bragging.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.280
That's so it's used.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.840
That started as a joke, but it is an actual brag.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.480
It's a little bit.

16:26.480 --> 16:26.880
Yeah.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.720
And maybe a little bit incriminating there.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.400
Hoarders.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.240
Well, I have only the two.

16:32.240 --> 16:32.740
Sorry.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.360
He's hoarding.

16:35.360 --> 16:35.920
He doesn't need that.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.160
Justin, I have only two rolls.

16:38.960 --> 16:42.080
I've lived with Travis a great many years of my life.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.920
And let me just say that is not a lot for Travis.

16:45.920 --> 16:50.480
That's a Wednesday morning through a Friday afternoon.

16:50.480 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, I get silly in there, you know, and get this, Justin.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.240
It's one ply, which I'm horrified to admit because that's basically nothing.

17:00.240 --> 17:05.520
I've been trying to look for toilet paper online to see if it's a bit,

17:05.520 --> 17:06.880
because you still can't buy it in stores.

17:06.880 --> 17:07.680
Did y'all hear about this?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.040
Oh, hey, stand back.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.880
He's about to like, there's a delivery here.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.520
I'm waiting for it.

17:13.520 --> 17:13.920
Go on.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.200
Because I feel like once it's online, it's available.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.400
You can still find the only toilet paper you can buy.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.320
And I'm so tempted.

17:22.320 --> 17:25.600
You can get like a giant, like one of the commercial,

17:27.280 --> 17:31.760
like three foot wide rolls, single ply rolls that from like,

17:31.760 --> 17:34.560
that you'd see at like a fucking convention center or something.

17:34.560 --> 17:38.000
And I feel like if I found that in someone's bathroom,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.560
that would actually tell me a whole lot about them.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.760
Mostly good.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.120
Yeah, good stuff.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.400
Good stuff, mostly good stuff about preparation and economy

17:46.400 --> 17:49.200
and just like general ass sensitivity.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.720
But I have been tempted to buy the giant roll

17:52.720 --> 17:54.240
and just not worry about it anymore.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.920
Then I don't have to worry about it ever again.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.040
I'll just have the giant roll.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.320
What if you walked into someone's bathroom,

17:58.320 --> 18:00.320
they had one of those three foot wide rolls,

18:00.320 --> 18:04.000
but it was like hanging on a chain that was bolted to the wall.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.120
What does that tell you?

18:06.320 --> 18:09.440
And you have to like get a key on like a big ladle

18:09.440 --> 18:11.280
to go in there and use the bathroom.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.720
What's that tell you about them?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.800
That you're at a gas station and not a house.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.160
Yeah, but like somebody lives there.

18:16.160 --> 18:16.880
You know what I mean?

18:16.880 --> 18:19.360
And they have like ding dongs in the bathroom.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.160
Yeah.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.000
Well, I guess the gas station man lives there.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.000
Is that what you're saying?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.480
Yeah, but that's his bathroom.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.680
It's the only bathroom he has.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.560
I'm trying to think of the last time I walked into a friend's bathroom

18:32.560 --> 18:35.200
and was like kind of shocked by what I saw in there.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.560
It's never I walk into somebody's bathroom

18:38.560 --> 18:43.520
and there's active shits in places where they shouldn't be.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.000
It's more like I walk into their bathroom

18:46.000 --> 18:51.920
and it is like very perfumed and potpourri

18:51.920 --> 18:55.280
and like very powdered and prim and proper

18:55.280 --> 18:58.400
in a way that you don't always anticipate.

18:58.400 --> 19:04.480
You walk in and it's like a mid 90s sort of like grandmother's bathroom.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.520
And that's like dope.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.000
That's great.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.680
That's your scent.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.600
And that's the profile that you chased down.

19:09.600 --> 19:13.520
It's just like I was not expecting that necessarily.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.760
For me, it's if I walk in there

19:15.760 --> 19:18.400
and there's some kind of poster on the wall that I wasn't expecting

19:18.400 --> 19:23.120
where it's like, oh, Jeff Goldblum is going to watch me doody.

19:23.120 --> 19:23.360
Okay.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.320
You ever seen that, Trav?

19:24.960 --> 19:27.200
A Jeff Goldblum poster in someone's bathroom?

19:27.200 --> 19:27.700
Yeah.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.200
Okay.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.140
I won't blow the shot, but-

19:31.140 --> 19:33.780
I think shower curtain design,

19:33.780 --> 19:36.100
like then you know who your fun friend is.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.060
Oh man.

19:37.060 --> 19:41.140
I went in there and that looked like fish on your shower curtain.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.060
That's fucking hilarious, Jeremy.

19:43.060 --> 19:46.100
I went in there and it kind of looked like the shower from Psycho.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.860
Like there was like a shadow on it, right?

19:47.860 --> 19:50.660
So if you're inside of it, it's like someone's going to kill you.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.060
That's funny and scary.

19:53.060 --> 19:54.660
That's funny and scary.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.100
That tickles both parts of my brain.

19:56.100 --> 19:56.900
I love that, Jeremy.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.340
It's just like critters in space.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.180
Funny and scary.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.420
I think it's weird to see unused bath bombs

20:04.420 --> 20:05.860
because what are you waiting for?

20:08.260 --> 20:09.140
Times are tough.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.460
Treat yourself.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.940
I think the reason all of the three of us have bidets

20:13.940 --> 20:15.380
is so you can walk into our bathroom

20:15.380 --> 20:17.540
and just sort of immediately clock what we're about

20:17.540 --> 20:19.380
without having to look anywhere else.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.660
You see the bidet on the toilet.

20:20.660 --> 20:23.940
We could have a poster hanging on the wall that says like,

20:23.940 --> 20:26.740
I like to murder and you would see the bidet and be like,

20:26.740 --> 20:28.660
I've seen all eight, case closed.

20:28.660 --> 20:29.220
I get it.

20:29.940 --> 20:30.980
I get their whole thing.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.620
It's an autobiography on top of my toilet.

20:34.580 --> 20:35.300
Here's another question.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.540
I have a goldfish named Gibby.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.460
Can I just say, I really like this one

20:39.460 --> 20:41.140
because I think more than all the questions

20:41.140 --> 20:42.580
about being quarantined,

20:42.580 --> 20:46.660
this one might best exemplify kind of

20:46.660 --> 20:48.260
what everyone's going through right now.

20:48.260 --> 20:48.980
So go ahead.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.380
I have a goldfish named Gibby that I keep in my room.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.220
Gibby is about to be three

20:57.220 --> 20:58.740
and for the past month and a half,

20:58.740 --> 21:00.260
he's been picking up pebbles in his tank,

21:00.260 --> 21:02.820
trying to eat them and then spinning them out very loudly.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.180
He does this in the middle of the night,

21:04.180 --> 21:05.460
usually at 2 a.m.

21:05.460 --> 21:09.700
How do I stop him or punish him without killing him?

21:09.700 --> 21:10.100
Okay.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.180
I still love my fishy boy.

21:12.180 --> 21:14.900
That's from Nautical Naughty in North Brunswick.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.580
What I love about this is this is the kind of thing

21:16.580 --> 21:19.780
where like maybe a month ago, your fish doing this,

21:19.780 --> 21:20.820
you wouldn't even clock it.

21:20.820 --> 21:21.540
You wouldn't even know.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.220
No, no, no, no, not even notice.

21:23.220 --> 21:25.940
Yeah, but now you're like, fuck Gibby.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.900
If you spit out one more goddamn pebble.

21:28.900 --> 21:31.060
My life with Gibby has gotten challenging.

21:32.100 --> 21:36.020
Day 14, things are tense between me and Gibby.

21:37.700 --> 21:38.980
I've had to start leaving on

21:40.820 --> 21:43.540
eight hour long YouTube videos of birds for my cat

21:44.740 --> 21:48.100
because my cat just can't chill.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.780
Just has zero chill.

21:49.780 --> 21:53.060
So while I'm kind of doing my thing downstairs,

21:53.060 --> 21:54.740
with the comedy and what have you,

21:54.740 --> 21:55.620
the jokes and things,

21:56.260 --> 21:58.100
the cat is watching bird vids

21:58.100 --> 22:01.220
just to kind of keep her a little bit chilled out.

22:01.220 --> 22:04.660
I gave Lily, my bigger doggy,

22:06.820 --> 22:08.980
you know, a squeaker chew toy thing that I've been saving

22:08.980 --> 22:10.660
because she was getting very antsy.

22:10.660 --> 22:14.340
And so I gave it to her and the pitch and frequency of it

22:14.340 --> 22:18.180
has become like an annoying like telltale heart.

22:18.180 --> 22:19.700
But like if it's out of a heartbeat,

22:19.700 --> 22:21.140
it was just a squeaker

22:21.140 --> 22:24.980
and it pierced through my brain every time,

22:24.980 --> 22:26.900
every 0.5 seconds.

22:26.900 --> 22:29.300
My little stinker is always up to no good.

22:29.300 --> 22:30.980
This fuzzy fucking rascal

22:30.980 --> 22:33.300
is always doing bad stuff in my house,

22:33.300 --> 22:35.540
but you gotta love them, huh?

22:35.540 --> 22:37.460
You gotta love your son.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.140
No man, I'm talking about my little,

22:39.700 --> 22:42.020
my puppers with his toe beans.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.420
This little stinker guys,

22:44.420 --> 22:46.260
you don't remember my puppers?

22:46.260 --> 22:47.460
It's just now occurred to me,

22:47.460 --> 22:49.540
my cat's always in quarantine.

22:49.540 --> 22:52.740
So the only thing that she could be negatively reacting to

22:52.740 --> 22:54.500
is our increased presence.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.380
Yes, right.

22:55.380 --> 22:56.980
That is what has irritated the cat.

22:56.980 --> 22:59.620
That's kind of her time to chill out.

22:59.620 --> 23:00.820
Maybe that's what Gibby's doing

23:00.820 --> 23:03.700
is Gibby is trying to annoy you out of the room.

23:03.700 --> 23:04.020
Yeah, please.

23:04.020 --> 23:05.220
This is Gibby's time.

23:05.860 --> 23:06.180
Please go.

23:06.180 --> 23:08.740
But at the same time, it's like who rescued who?

23:08.740 --> 23:09.460
You know what?

23:09.460 --> 23:10.180
Thank you.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.540
Because I always think that

23:11.540 --> 23:13.540
when I look at my puppers' toe beans.

23:14.340 --> 23:15.780
Can I make a suggestion?

23:15.780 --> 23:16.500
Here's what you do,

23:16.500 --> 23:18.900
a nautical naughty in North Brunswick,

23:19.460 --> 23:21.460
get a bowl, get an identical fish bowl

23:22.180 --> 23:26.020
and put, I don't know, like some clear edible,

23:26.020 --> 23:27.940
so that maybe like Cairo syrup,

23:27.940 --> 23:29.300
something clear and edible,

23:29.300 --> 23:31.540
and then put one goldfish cracker in it.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.300
Put it next to Gibby's bowl

23:33.300 --> 23:35.620
and then yell at the fake goldfish cracker,

23:35.620 --> 23:37.380
like you've been annoying the hell out of me

23:37.380 --> 23:39.940
and then eat that goldfish cracker in front of Gibby.

23:40.500 --> 23:40.740
Cool.

23:40.740 --> 23:42.820
And then kind of slowly turn to Gibby and say,

23:42.820 --> 23:45.380
you're next if you keep it up with that pebble thing.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.820
That's a cool idea.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.420
Yeah, it's a cool idea.

23:48.420 --> 23:51.700
No, it's definitely not like really troubling

23:51.700 --> 23:52.820
and it'll work.

23:52.820 --> 23:54.900
The fish will get it for sure, for sure, for sure.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.020
Well, okay Griffin.

23:56.020 --> 23:57.460
Okay, smart guy.

23:57.460 --> 24:00.100
Give me a punishment that one could enact on a fish

24:00.100 --> 24:03.540
that would not kill it, period.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.980
Okay, put it further away from you.

24:06.980 --> 24:09.780
That's not a punishment, that's what the fish wants.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.900
Then good, both parties win

24:12.900 --> 24:15.540
and you can be in the corner and do...

24:15.540 --> 24:17.540
First, fish can't make loud noises.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.100
There's no fish, unless it is a whale

24:20.100 --> 24:22.180
and it slaps its big body against the water

24:22.180 --> 24:23.140
after diving out of it.

24:23.140 --> 24:24.660
Fish cannot make loud noises.

24:24.660 --> 24:27.620
So this is a full-blown fever dream

24:27.620 --> 24:29.780
that you've got going on and that's fine.

24:29.780 --> 24:31.860
We've all got them, it's tough times out here.

24:31.860 --> 24:32.900
But if you're having trouble

24:32.900 --> 24:35.700
with your completely stationary aquatic pet,

24:35.700 --> 24:37.300
put it in the corner or outside.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.740
There's so many places for this fish to go.

24:38.740 --> 24:39.540
Don't put it outside.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.740
Don't put it outside.

24:40.740 --> 24:41.780
Don't put it outside.

24:41.780 --> 24:42.900
Don't put it outside.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.900
I mean, there's a temptation to say,

24:44.900 --> 24:47.060
like, just feed him less.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.860
But you know Gibby, he's just getting up fucking shredded

24:49.860 --> 24:53.060
and looking great and shredding those last few ounces

24:53.060 --> 24:55.620
that he needed to get to his sexiest fish bod.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.420
I'm just worried.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.820
I'm worried about rewarding his negative behavior

24:58.820 --> 25:00.500
because now he wants to be moved.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.380
You move him because he's been behaving badly.

25:03.380 --> 25:04.180
And then what's next?

25:04.180 --> 25:06.980
He wants a tiny TV and then he starts yelling at you,

25:07.780 --> 25:11.060
ping, ping, ping, spitting those pebbles against the bowl.

25:11.060 --> 25:12.740
And then you're like, fine, you'll get a tiny TV.

25:12.740 --> 25:13.540
And then what's next?

25:13.540 --> 25:14.580
His own house?

25:14.580 --> 25:15.860
A water slide?

25:15.860 --> 25:18.020
I think this is where you got to draw the line.

25:18.020 --> 25:20.020
You need to establish dominance.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.380
You need to get in that bowl.

25:21.380 --> 25:22.820
You need to swim better than him.

25:23.460 --> 25:25.460
You need to spit pebbles better than him.

25:25.460 --> 25:27.540
Establish fish dominance.

25:27.540 --> 25:28.020
Travis?

25:28.020 --> 25:29.620
You could get in his head maybe

25:29.620 --> 25:31.620
and watch the shape of water near him

25:31.620 --> 25:33.700
and then just every few minutes be like, I get it.

25:34.260 --> 25:34.980
I get it.

25:34.980 --> 25:35.940
Absolutely.

25:35.940 --> 25:36.580
I get it.

25:36.580 --> 25:36.900
Yes.

25:37.860 --> 25:40.900
Now, is that to scare him

25:40.900 --> 25:43.460
into thinking that you might be romantically attracted to him?

25:45.540 --> 25:48.100
I mean, you just keep guessing.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.620
You're not willing to commit to the bit

25:49.620 --> 25:50.900
you just crafted, Justin.

25:51.460 --> 25:51.940
I don't know.

25:52.740 --> 25:54.980
Your own thing made you uncomfortable, didn't it?

25:54.980 --> 25:56.340
While you were in the middle of it,

25:56.340 --> 25:58.580
I could tell you were like, oof, this sucks.

25:58.580 --> 25:59.380
Middle of it.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.060
In the middle of it, I didn't like it.

26:01.060 --> 26:01.380
Travis.

26:01.380 --> 26:02.340
I don't like it.

26:02.340 --> 26:05.140
I like it less now, but in the middle of it, I started.

26:05.140 --> 26:06.660
At the beginning, let me chart.

26:06.660 --> 26:07.060
Yeah.

26:07.060 --> 26:08.980
At the beginning, I liked it.

26:08.980 --> 26:09.380
Yeah.

26:09.380 --> 26:11.780
I felt very good about getting in there with it.

26:11.780 --> 26:15.380
Middle of the road, sort of halfway through the project,

26:15.380 --> 26:19.220
took a little intermission in my medulla oblongata

26:19.220 --> 26:21.380
and started to rethink the whole enterprise.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.700
By the end of it, I wish I'd punched out earlier,

26:24.260 --> 26:27.540
but I felt like I was pot committed and I hate it.

26:27.540 --> 26:29.540
Can I ask you a quick post-game question?

26:29.540 --> 26:30.660
Yeah, anything, Travis.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.180
I'd love to follow up on this

26:32.180 --> 26:34.420
so that others can learn from my failings.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.020
Now, if you could go back and do it again,

26:36.020 --> 26:40.020
would you change the movie or change your delivery or?

26:40.660 --> 26:44.020
Okay, so I did think about A Fish Called Wanda

26:44.020 --> 26:46.660
and I thought maybe something there with Kevin Kline

26:47.460 --> 26:49.700
eating the fish, if you remember, right?

26:50.580 --> 26:53.540
And then I thought something about the fish man

26:53.540 --> 26:55.700
and then from Shape of Water

26:55.700 --> 26:57.220
and then just the opening was there.

26:57.860 --> 26:59.540
I just started going.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.700
I didn't have a goal line in mind.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.900
I just started going for it.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.580
I wish Justin you had brought up

27:04.580 --> 27:07.380
the incredible Mr. Limpet so I could have crossed off

27:07.380 --> 27:10.820
the fucking wild obscure references

27:10.820 --> 27:13.540
my bim bam bingo card that I have printed out here.

27:16.740 --> 27:20.180
I would love, you know, I thought of something different.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.380
Let's go to the money zone.

27:21.380 --> 27:24.100
We don't need to talk about my thing anymore, for sure.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.900
Sure, Justin sounds good.

27:26.900 --> 27:36.500
Justin Thank you, Philip.

27:36.500 --> 27:42.500
Hey, listen, did you just eat a fish

27:42.500 --> 27:45.620
and you want to get the taste of your goldfish out of your mouth?

27:45.620 --> 27:47.460
Good news, you've got Quip.

27:48.260 --> 27:51.220
Quip, it says here is the makers of the Quip electric toothbrush

27:51.220 --> 27:53.700
that is the best at scrubbing goldfish

27:53.700 --> 27:55.300
from betwixt your chompers.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.900
Huh, that's weird.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.660
It's weird how well that works out.

27:58.660 --> 28:00.100
Oh, get David Blaine over your house.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.740
He knows how to do it, but then cancel it out.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.180
David Blaine knows how to swallow the fish,

28:04.180 --> 28:04.980
but then get it out.

28:04.980 --> 28:06.260
It's two different fish.

28:06.260 --> 28:07.700
He does get a real fish every time.

28:07.700 --> 28:11.140
It's two fish.

28:12.020 --> 28:12.740
They're twins.

28:12.740 --> 28:13.620
It's twin fish.

28:15.620 --> 28:17.380
Okay, so it's basically the prestige.

28:18.020 --> 28:19.940
Well, it's not exactly the prestige.

28:21.460 --> 28:23.540
It is, okay, it is the prestige.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.220
David Blaine is a big fan of the prestige.

28:25.220 --> 28:26.980
So you've been brushing your teeth

28:26.980 --> 28:28.180
and you're like, how long has that been?

28:28.180 --> 28:29.860
Cause it still tastes like goldfish.

28:29.860 --> 28:32.900
Well, they have a built-in two minute timer

28:32.900 --> 28:34.900
in the Quip electric toothbrush

28:34.900 --> 28:36.100
so that you won't have to worry about

28:36.100 --> 28:36.980
if you've brushed long enough

28:36.980 --> 28:38.660
to get the goldfish out from between your teeth.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.020
And if there's some stuck in there,

28:40.020 --> 28:42.340
they also provide floss, which is great

28:42.340 --> 28:44.500
because that will get that hard to reach goldfish

28:44.500 --> 28:46.020
out from between your teeth.

28:46.020 --> 28:49.140
And they deliver toothpaste, brush heads

28:49.140 --> 28:52.020
and floss refills every three months

28:52.020 --> 28:55.140
because your old ones are going to be caked in goldfish bits

28:55.140 --> 28:57.220
and you can get it with free shipping.

28:57.220 --> 29:01.460
So go to getquip.com slash my brother right now

29:01.460 --> 29:03.300

29:13.220 --> 29:15.460
Hey, it's tough to go pretty much anywhere right now.

29:15.460 --> 29:16.820
And that includes the post office

29:16.820 --> 29:20.740
which is an extant space in the world.

29:21.700 --> 29:24.660
But hey, you need to send out letters and packages.

You need your postage.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.220

29:51.940 --> 29:53.940

30:28.580 --> 30:32.580
They do have that in the copy at the end of the thing.

30:33.380 --> 30:34.900
And you have to read it.

30:34.900 --> 30:35.700
You have to read it.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.900
And it is, okay, we'll say this.

30:38.900 --> 30:42.420
As performers and ad copy readers,

30:43.220 --> 30:45.700
it is mandatory that we do say stay safe, my friends.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.180
But it does, for a mandatory message,

30:48.180 --> 30:52.820
it does make me feel a certain amount of warmth and care.

30:52.820 --> 30:53.940
A mandatory amount.

30:53.940 --> 30:55.940
A mandatory amount of essential-

30:55.940 --> 30:57.700
Wait, is it possible stamps.com is saying that

30:57.700 --> 30:58.820
just to the three of us?

30:59.620 --> 31:01.060
Oh, it is maybe,

31:01.060 --> 31:04.500
but I didn't know stamps.com thought of us that way.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.740
I thought of us as business liaisons,

31:06.740 --> 31:09.860
but I guess I do love,

31:09.860 --> 31:11.860
I guess I am in love with stamps.com.

31:11.860 --> 31:14.180
Every Christmas they do send me four brownies.

31:14.180 --> 31:14.420
Yeah.

31:14.420 --> 31:15.940
So what's that all about?

31:15.940 --> 31:16.440
Stop.

31:17.860 --> 31:20.980
Welcome back to Fireside Chat on KMAX.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.820
With me in studio to take your calls

31:22.820 --> 31:25.380
is the dopest duo on the West Coast,

31:25.380 --> 31:27.940
Oliver Wong and Morgan Rhodes.

31:27.940 --> 31:29.140
Go ahead, caller.

31:29.140 --> 31:31.460
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast

31:31.460 --> 31:33.220
that's insightful and thoughtful,

31:33.220 --> 31:35.300
but also helps me discover artists

31:35.300 --> 31:36.820
and albums that I've never heard of.

31:36.820 --> 31:39.060
Yeah, man, sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks.

31:39.060 --> 31:41.140
Every week, myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes,

31:41.140 --> 31:43.140
and my co-host here, Oliver Wong,

31:43.140 --> 31:46.260
talk to influential guests about a canonical album

31:46.260 --> 31:48.340
that has changed their lives.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.660
Guests like Moby, Open Mike Eagle,

31:50.660 --> 31:54.500
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell, and so much more.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
Yo, what's that show called again?

31:56.500 --> 31:59.300
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.300
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

32:04.180 --> 32:04.680
Okay.

32:06.020 --> 32:06.980
Is that bad?

32:06.980 --> 32:07.060
No.

32:07.060 --> 32:08.100
You sounded disappointed.

32:08.100 --> 32:14.020
No, I just, it's, sometimes it's...

32:14.020 --> 32:15.300
I want a munch.

32:15.300 --> 32:15.800
What?

32:18.340 --> 32:20.340
I want too much.

32:20.340 --> 32:24.740
Now it's bad.

32:24.740 --> 32:25.620
That was a punk one.

32:26.180 --> 32:26.580
Whew.

32:26.580 --> 32:27.620
It's like grimy punk.

32:27.620 --> 32:28.900
That was really punky.

32:28.900 --> 32:29.460
Yeah, dude.

32:29.460 --> 32:30.660
Yeah, it's really punky.

32:31.220 --> 32:32.100
Snack flag.

32:33.540 --> 32:34.980
Why did I take it back to,

32:34.980 --> 32:37.540
I took it back to more retro,

32:37.540 --> 32:39.540
because I have an exciting new development.

32:40.900 --> 32:44.260
And this, I have to give the credit.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.180
This was not necessarily my idea,

32:46.180 --> 32:48.340
but I think it is genius.

32:48.340 --> 32:49.540
This came in from Quinn,

32:50.100 --> 32:54.580
and Quinn suggested a throwback munch squad

32:54.580 --> 32:58.660
that we go back way back to before,

32:59.380 --> 33:01.220
and not just like to a few years back,

33:01.220 --> 33:02.420
ones we might've missed.

33:02.420 --> 33:03.780
We dig deep.

33:03.780 --> 33:04.260
Oh.

33:04.260 --> 33:04.660
Right?

33:04.660 --> 33:06.740
I mean, so I'm putting out the call

33:06.740 --> 33:08.900
if you can get some press releases

33:08.900 --> 33:11.540
from like wild shit that came before.

33:11.540 --> 33:13.060
The Library of Congress

33:13.060 --> 33:15.300
to find like when McDonald's did pizza.

33:16.020 --> 33:16.740
Yeah.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.020
That's what I'm talking about.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.700
Find me those press releases.

33:19.700 --> 33:20.820
Dig way deep.

33:20.820 --> 33:21.860
Let's get nasty.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.820
In Big Big Pizza War,

33:24.820 --> 33:26.740
will Bigfoot top the Dominator?

33:26.740 --> 33:28.020
Oh my God, yes.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.460
Oh yeah.

33:29.460 --> 33:31.220
This is a, listen folks,

33:31.220 --> 33:34.900
this is a news story published,

33:34.900 --> 33:35.940
it's by Michael Dresser,

33:35.940 --> 33:37.940
published in the Baltimore Sun

33:37.940 --> 33:41.620
on April 30th, 1993.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.120
Wow.

33:42.980 --> 33:46.980
This is a, blow the dust off of it.

33:46.980 --> 33:47.860
This munch squad.

33:50.260 --> 33:51.220
Man, this is good.

33:51.220 --> 33:53.060
I'm really, I've been really excited

33:53.060 --> 33:54.580
the whole show to read this to y'all.

33:55.460 --> 33:56.740
Is that why you killed Sonic?

33:57.460 --> 33:58.740
Hasta la pizza, baby.

34:03.940 --> 34:04.500
All right.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.060
Good start.

34:05.060 --> 34:05.540
All right.

34:05.540 --> 34:07.300
Hasta la pizza, baby.

34:07.300 --> 34:08.500
Here comes the Dominator.

34:09.540 --> 34:10.820
Boasting that it has created

34:10.820 --> 34:12.260
the biggest, baddest,

34:12.260 --> 34:14.740
hunkahunkah melted cheese on the market.

34:14.740 --> 34:15.860
Oh, fuck me.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.300
Domino's Pizza Inc.

34:17.300 --> 34:20.100
lurched into the Monster Pizza Wars yesterday

34:20.100 --> 34:23.700
with a 30 inch, 30 slice pie

34:23.700 --> 34:25.220
in the face of its competitors.

34:25.220 --> 34:26.420
That's one, hold up.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.420
Each slice is one inch?

34:28.420 --> 34:28.980
Fuck off.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.340
This is what's challenging.

34:30.980 --> 34:33.300
Brought to life in Domino's Laboratories

34:33.300 --> 34:34.740
in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.260
The Dominator will grapple

34:36.260 --> 34:38.260
with Pizza Hut's Bigfoot

34:38.260 --> 34:40.740
and Little Caesar's Big Big Pizza

34:40.740 --> 34:42.340
for the biggest bite of the market

34:42.340 --> 34:43.780
for carry out pizza

34:43.780 --> 34:45.220
with a gland condition.

34:45.220 --> 34:45.540
Okay.

34:45.540 --> 34:46.580
Hilarious.

34:46.580 --> 34:47.620
Reggie Fils-Aime.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.100
Hilarious.

34:48.660 --> 34:50.420
His biggest failure

34:51.140 --> 34:52.580
in his time at the Pizza Hut

34:52.580 --> 34:54.580
and perhaps his biggest professional failure

34:54.580 --> 34:58.180
was the Pizza Hut Bigfoot pizza.

34:58.180 --> 35:02.580
And now Domino's is challenging Reggie's failure

35:02.580 --> 35:04.900
with the Dominator.

35:04.900 --> 35:07.060
Domino's Rectangular Dominator.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.300
So that should make more sense, right?

35:09.300 --> 35:10.260
It will measure a,

35:11.380 --> 35:12.980
fuck it, 1993.

35:12.980 --> 35:17.060
Measure a Schwarzeneggerian,

35:17.780 --> 35:18.820
Schwarzeneggerian,

35:19.460 --> 35:21.460
10 inches by 30 inches.

35:21.460 --> 35:22.980
Okay, 10 inches by 30.

35:22.980 --> 35:24.020
So that's 300.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.900
Tim Mac, it's 300 square inches of pizza

35:26.900 --> 35:28.740
in 30 slices, each slice is 10.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.660
Okay, I was getting there.

35:30.660 --> 35:31.220
Square inches.

35:31.220 --> 35:32.660
I was gonna get there, Justin.

35:32.660 --> 35:33.860
You have to let me do it on my own

35:33.860 --> 35:35.700
if I'm ever gonna get better at it.

35:35.700 --> 35:36.900
Late side by side,

35:36.900 --> 35:38.500
it's bigger than my three-year-old.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.300
Who I have always wanted to eat.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.260
Dad, let me up.

35:42.980 --> 35:45.860
Said a Domino's spokesman, Tim McIntyre.

35:46.660 --> 35:46.900
Later.

35:46.900 --> 35:47.940
Bigger than my three-year-old.

35:49.940 --> 35:50.980
Oh wait, hold on.

35:50.980 --> 35:51.940
I'm reading right here.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.940
It says, okay, yeah, uh-huh.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.060
Okay, okay.

35:55.060 --> 36:00.180
This 27, 30-year-old man just killed his dad.

36:00.180 --> 36:03.700
Oh, and he said it's because he used to lay me next to pizza.

36:04.260 --> 36:07.060
I lay my kid next to a pizza for a thing I wanted to say.

36:07.860 --> 36:09.700
The Mine's Bigger Than Yours contest

36:09.700 --> 36:11.860
got started in earnest last month

36:11.860 --> 36:14.260
when Little Caesars began the national rollout

36:14.260 --> 36:17.700
of its 11 and a quarter by 22 and a half inch

36:17.700 --> 36:20.340
big, big pizza on the Ides of March.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.460
That roused the wrath of Pizza the Hut,

36:23.460 --> 36:26.420
which went Little Caesar a step bigger, bigger

36:26.420 --> 36:31.460
by trumping out this fucking big ups to you, Michael Dresser,

36:31.460 --> 36:33.140
for putting in the fucking work.

36:33.140 --> 36:34.020
Yeah, dude.

36:34.020 --> 36:34.340
Putting in the work.

36:34.340 --> 36:37.540
You don't see this kind of attention to detail anymore

36:37.540 --> 36:38.740
in these press releases.

36:38.740 --> 36:40.900
The Ides of March thing is a goof on the fact

36:40.900 --> 36:41.940
that it's Little Caesars.

36:41.940 --> 36:42.180
Yes.

36:42.180 --> 36:46.100
Fucking layers upon layers of melted cheese and sauce and bread.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.540
Now here comes the Dominator.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.780
Delighted, Travis.

36:51.780 --> 36:53.140
Now here comes the Dominator,

36:53.140 --> 36:56.340
scheduled to begin hitting the stores in various markets

36:56.340 --> 36:58.980
whether Baltimore is one hasn't been decided

37:00.020 --> 37:01.060
in about two weeks.

37:01.940 --> 37:04.820
In a switch from Domino's traditional emphasis

37:04.820 --> 37:06.340
on delivered pizza,

37:06.340 --> 37:09.460
it will be available by carryout only.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.500
That's right, folks.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.900
You can't get this set to your house.

37:12.900 --> 37:13.860
You have to go.

37:13.860 --> 37:15.460
You have to come here to do this

37:15.460 --> 37:16.980
because it's a crime otherwise.

37:18.260 --> 37:20.980
We don't even know if our 1993 automobiles

37:20.980 --> 37:23.380
could handle a pizza this large.

37:23.380 --> 37:25.780
The market that we're going after,

37:25.780 --> 37:30.020
the carryout value pizza market is a very hungry one,

37:30.020 --> 37:31.700
said Mr. McIntyre.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.300
Why not be the biggest?

37:33.300 --> 37:38.340
Hey, Tim, you've said several wild things all together

37:38.340 --> 37:40.020
with very few wild words.

37:40.020 --> 37:41.620
You've said a very wild thing

37:41.620 --> 37:45.140
and that is pizza hungry people love a hungry pizza.

37:45.140 --> 37:45.860
Get it big.

37:47.380 --> 37:49.620
So you're saying hungry people want a big pizza.

37:49.620 --> 37:50.180
Yes.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.540
What about two pizzas?

37:51.540 --> 37:52.340
What?

37:52.340 --> 37:54.900
What? You can do two pizzas and have both.

37:55.860 --> 37:57.140
Somebody could bring them to you

37:57.140 --> 37:58.340
and you wouldn't have to leave your house.

37:58.900 --> 38:01.780
But big people with big hunger only have one mouth.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.420
Nice try.

38:03.540 --> 38:04.660
They drive a car.

38:04.660 --> 38:05.780
Come get me pizza.

38:05.780 --> 38:07.620
They love leaving house.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.860
Hey guys, I'm not halfway through the story

38:09.860 --> 38:12.100
and I'm not a third into the wildest shit in it.

38:12.100 --> 38:12.340
Okay.

38:12.980 --> 38:15.700
But what really accounts for this mega pizza trend?

38:15.700 --> 38:18.020
Have the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles multiplied?

38:18.020 --> 38:18.660
Oh my God.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.500
Is President Clinton's White House staff

38:20.500 --> 38:22.420
pulling too many all-nighters for ordinary pizzas?

38:22.420 --> 38:23.060
Oh boy.

38:24.020 --> 38:25.940
Fucking just keep it coming.

38:25.940 --> 38:28.340
It's like, I know it was written in 93

38:28.340 --> 38:31.220
but I feel like it was written to be read in 2020

38:31.220 --> 38:33.860
to take you on a fucking, I love the 90s.

38:33.860 --> 38:35.460
He finished it and sealed it up

38:35.460 --> 38:38.260
and then just like buried it in Justin's front yard.

38:38.980 --> 38:41.620
It's like, I feel like I'm watching like Good Night

38:41.620 --> 38:43.060
and Good Gene Shallot.

38:43.060 --> 38:44.020
It's fantastic.

38:44.660 --> 38:46.580
This is the quote.

38:46.580 --> 38:49.220
It would go a long way towards sating the hunger

38:49.220 --> 38:50.980
of the healthcare task force,

38:50.980 --> 38:53.620
said a spokesman in the White House press office

38:53.620 --> 38:56.260
who asked to be identified only as assistant

38:56.260 --> 38:58.980
to the president in charge of pizza control.

38:58.980 --> 39:00.180
What in the living fuck?

39:01.060 --> 39:03.140
The only problem he said is security.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.660
It's dangerous, quote.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.820
You could fit a lot of stuff on a pizza that big.

39:06.820 --> 39:09.460
He said, fucking story.

39:09.460 --> 39:13.380
Do you know that originally Prince titled the song pizza control?

39:13.380 --> 39:14.900
And then they said, well, I don't think

39:14.900 --> 39:16.740
that that's risque enough for Prince.

39:16.740 --> 39:17.940
Make it yucky here, Prince.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.860
And he said, okay, I think I can judge it up a little bit.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.940
This White House staffer was reached out to

39:25.940 --> 39:27.860
for a quote about the big pizzas

39:27.860 --> 39:30.020
and made a fun joke about, oh, I don't know.

39:30.020 --> 39:30.900
We love pizza around here.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.500
And then realized like, wait a minute.

39:33.700 --> 39:38.340
You could stick a lot of anthrax in a 30 square inch pizza.

39:38.340 --> 39:41.860
And this was pre 9-11 when they didn't even check the pizzas.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.500
A lot of things changed on 9-11.

39:44.500 --> 39:47.860
You used to be able to just walk up and hand a pizza directly

39:47.860 --> 39:48.900
to the president.

39:48.900 --> 39:51.780
A lot of things also changed in the fall of 1993

39:51.780 --> 39:53.700
when these big pizzas came around.

39:54.260 --> 39:55.940
Oh God, where to next?

39:55.940 --> 39:56.580
Oh, that's right.

39:56.580 --> 39:57.080
Okay.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.100
Fucking Michael Dresser, you genius.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.540
But futurist Melinda Davis said,

40:03.540 --> 40:06.500
this big pizza business has nothing to do with politics.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.620
It's about sex.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.180
What?

40:08.180 --> 40:08.580
What?

40:08.580 --> 40:09.080
Huh?

40:11.380 --> 40:12.740
Consider the shape, she said.

40:12.740 --> 40:15.380
Pizza was traditionally a very female thing.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.940
It's very round and cheesy and warm.

40:17.940 --> 40:18.820
Holy fuck.

40:18.820 --> 40:22.340
And suddenly it's become pizza as a weapon, said Miss Davis.

40:22.340 --> 40:22.820
What?

40:22.820 --> 40:24.020
Creative director at Brain Reserve,

40:24.020 --> 40:25.140
a New York based marketing firm

40:25.140 --> 40:27.140
that specializes in consumer trends.

40:27.140 --> 40:27.940
What the fuck?

40:27.940 --> 40:30.100
Also someday everyone will have phones

40:30.100 --> 40:31.860
that are also computers.

40:33.220 --> 40:38.420
But are they saying a rectangle is like a dick is like a weapon?

40:38.420 --> 40:43.300
Like a weapon, not like women who are round and warm cheese.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.020
Yes.

40:44.020 --> 40:50.260
That is a profound and hugely wrong statement, obviously.

40:50.260 --> 40:54.420
But it's like, I don't even know if it's sexist or not

40:54.420 --> 40:56.260
because it's so hard to unpack.

40:56.820 --> 40:58.820
Well, I think we can all agree

40:58.820 --> 41:01.860
that people who identify as female

41:01.860 --> 41:05.220
give off a certain warm, cheesy energy.

41:05.220 --> 41:06.980
Cheesy vibe.

41:06.980 --> 41:10.340
Whereas men who, people who identify as men

41:11.060 --> 41:16.340
often give off this kind of rectangular kind of,

41:17.380 --> 41:19.700
why is it, why are they so big?

41:19.700 --> 41:22.180
I've got big rhombus energy over here.

41:22.180 --> 41:25.220
Pizza was traditionally a very female thing.

41:25.220 --> 41:28.180
It's very round and cheesy and warm.

41:28.180 --> 41:31.620
And suddenly it's become pizza as a weapon, said Miss Davis.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.580
But why?

41:32.580 --> 41:35.620
Quote, because we're in the age of AIDS.

41:35.620 --> 41:40.020
We have to look for sensual pleasure that isn't sexual.

41:40.020 --> 41:41.940
She said, it's about anger.

41:41.940 --> 41:43.700
It's about rage.

41:43.700 --> 41:46.100
Consumers are really mad at all the rules

41:46.100 --> 41:47.300
they have to follow in the 90s.

41:47.300 --> 41:48.260
What is happening?

41:48.260 --> 41:51.700
Sue Sherbo, a spokeswoman for Little Caesars in Detroit

41:51.700 --> 41:52.980
seemed puzzled by that logic.

41:53.860 --> 41:56.900
Our only concern was to offer our customer a great value.

41:57.780 --> 41:59.860
We weren't even looking at it from the AIDS angle.

41:59.860 --> 42:03.060
Sue doesn't agree that people want to fuck the giant pizza.

42:03.060 --> 42:04.500
Sue can't get there with her.

42:04.500 --> 42:08.420
What, Justin, this isn't just a, this isn't a munch quad.

42:08.420 --> 42:12.420
This is the greatest news article ever written.

42:12.420 --> 42:16.340
This is the greatest interviewing ever, ever done.

42:16.340 --> 42:19.540
Michael Dresser, you fucking genius.

42:20.740 --> 42:22.500
Okay, thank you.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.100
At Michael Dresser, by the way,

42:24.100 --> 42:26.100
in case you want to just thank Michael,

42:26.100 --> 42:28.100
Michael T. Dresser, excuse me.

42:28.100 --> 42:30.100
In case you want to thank Michael, he's retired now,

42:30.100 --> 42:32.740
but you can still thank him for his amazing work,

42:32.740 --> 42:34.100
which I'm not finished with.

42:34.100 --> 42:37.140
What is the statute of limitations for a Pulitzer, by the way?

42:37.140 --> 42:38.260
Is it too late?

42:39.380 --> 42:40.980
That's a weird way of asking the question,

42:40.980 --> 42:42.820
but in this case, it does apply.

42:42.820 --> 42:45.460
In any case, Domino's competitors have no intention

42:45.460 --> 42:46.820
of trying to go at one bigger.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.460
We think it's the right size pizza

42:49.460 --> 42:51.380
for what our customer is looking for.

42:51.380 --> 42:54.740
Rob Dowdy, a spokesman at Pizza Hut headquarters

42:54.740 --> 42:56.100
in Wichita, Kansas said yesterday,

42:56.900 --> 42:59.860
teenagers tend to travel in packs, in groups,

42:59.860 --> 43:02.100
and usually they're a bit short of cash.

43:02.100 --> 43:04.100
So this is the kind of product they're looking for.

43:05.700 --> 43:08.100
Mr. McIntyre said he could not say

43:08.100 --> 43:10.580
whether the Dominator will be sold in the Baltimore market

43:10.580 --> 43:12.820
because the decision on whether to carry the product

43:12.820 --> 43:14.500
will be left to individual operators.

43:14.500 --> 43:17.380
Now, a spokeswoman at the regional office,

43:17.380 --> 43:20.660
Michael Dresser putting in the work, the shoe leather.

43:20.660 --> 43:22.660
A spokeswoman at the regional office said

43:22.660 --> 43:24.900
she did not know whether Baltimore area franchisees

43:24.900 --> 43:25.940
would be interested.

43:25.940 --> 43:28.260
I assure you, ma'am, they will be.

43:28.260 --> 43:30.500
In any case, Mr. McIntyre said Domino's

43:30.500 --> 43:33.300
will be heavily promoting the Dominator in a few months.

43:33.300 --> 43:37.220
Quote, it's a big, colossal, humongous pizza,

43:37.220 --> 43:39.220
and we're looking at ads that will come across

43:39.220 --> 43:42.100
in a big, colossal, humongous way.

43:43.140 --> 43:43.640
Epilogue.

43:44.980 --> 43:48.980
Joseph Simone, president of Mama Ilardo's Corp,

43:48.980 --> 43:52.420
said his relatively small Owings Mills-based pizza chain

43:52.420 --> 43:54.820
would not be intimidated by its bigger rivals,

43:54.820 --> 43:57.780
nor will it be drawn into an effort at topping them.

43:57.780 --> 44:02.020
Quote, you can't serve top quality ingredients

44:02.020 --> 44:05.140
in a product that size and not price yourself

44:05.140 --> 44:07.140
out of the market, he said.

44:08.180 --> 44:11.140
It's like the difference between making sauce

44:11.140 --> 44:14.660
for two people and making sauce for the 5th Infantry.

44:14.660 --> 44:15.160
Huh.

44:16.340 --> 44:16.840
The end.

44:16.840 --> 44:18.660
I guess I've never thought of it that way.

44:19.140 --> 44:20.180
Travis, just let it.

44:20.180 --> 44:21.300
Just give it a moment.

44:21.300 --> 44:21.800
Let it breathe.

44:21.800 --> 44:22.500
Just give it a moment.

44:23.060 --> 44:23.560
The end.

44:25.780 --> 44:26.740
Thank you, Michael Dresser.

44:26.740 --> 44:30.740
Thank you, Michael Dresser, thank you for this fantastic,

44:31.380 --> 44:32.340
fantastic piece.

44:32.900 --> 44:38.340
You really put literally tens of thousands of times

44:38.340 --> 44:40.500
the amount of effort this story required of you,

44:40.500 --> 44:43.620
and you put in the fucking work, and thank you.

44:43.620 --> 44:44.500
I appreciate you.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.000
Thank you.

44:45.860 --> 44:48.020
This is the best news story I've read,

44:48.020 --> 44:49.380
certainly in the past few weeks.

44:51.380 --> 44:54.260
I would like to think that after this was published,

44:54.260 --> 44:57.300
that Michael's bosses said like, okay,

44:57.300 --> 44:59.860
we're moving you to like cover homicide.

44:59.860 --> 45:01.620
Like, okay, yeah, right.

45:01.620 --> 45:03.780
I don't know if Michael Dresser is writing

45:03.780 --> 45:06.660
about current sort of pandemic events,

45:06.660 --> 45:09.300
but I hope he does not apply the same level

45:09.300 --> 45:11.380
of frivolity to it.

45:11.380 --> 45:12.340
I'm sure he doesn't.

45:12.340 --> 45:14.820
I bet he matches the tone of the news he's writing.

45:14.820 --> 45:17.300
It is not like, holy smokes.

45:18.020 --> 45:19.460
It's the disease.

45:19.460 --> 45:20.500
Like, probably not like that.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.540
My corona.

45:22.100 --> 45:23.700
Yeah, yeah.

45:23.700 --> 45:27.620
He retired in December of 2018

45:27.620 --> 45:29.860
as the state house correspondent for the Baltimore Sun.

45:29.860 --> 45:31.060
Hell yes.

45:31.700 --> 45:32.340
Got out on top.

45:32.340 --> 45:34.500
Michael Dresser, you absolute legend.

45:34.500 --> 45:39.300
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by a few people.

45:39.300 --> 45:39.860
Thank you.

45:39.860 --> 45:43.380
It's Yahoo Answers user Varsha who asks,

45:44.260 --> 45:45.940
and there may not be much meat on these bones,

45:45.940 --> 45:50.340
but there's something in here that really busted me up.

45:50.340 --> 45:55.220
Varsha asks, I cried more during the death of Optimus Prime

45:55.220 --> 45:56.900
than I cried during the Titanic.

45:56.900 --> 45:57.620
Is that okay?

45:58.980 --> 46:00.420
Updated two days ago.

46:00.420 --> 46:01.700
I didn't really care that much.

46:01.700 --> 46:02.980
Felt it was so stupid.

46:02.980 --> 46:04.580
Would have frozen with him, lol.

46:05.140 --> 46:06.820
Updated again two days ago.

46:07.380 --> 46:09.300
But every time I see Optimus Prime die

46:09.300 --> 46:10.340
in the cartoon especially,

46:10.340 --> 46:12.980
I don't care if I saw a Kevin Hart video prior.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.180
I lose all control.

46:14.180 --> 46:14.980
Anyone agree?

46:14.980 --> 46:15.480
Ow.

46:18.180 --> 46:18.820
Third update.

46:18.820 --> 46:21.380
Third update, how he stab Optimus Prime.

46:21.380 --> 46:22.500
That like our father.

46:23.700 --> 46:24.900
That like our father.

46:24.900 --> 46:25.380
It's true.

46:25.380 --> 46:31.460
That's true and good and I like to cry

46:32.020 --> 46:33.940
and I like to watch stuff that makes me cry.

46:35.540 --> 46:37.620
Grey's Anatomy when sad stuff happens on there.

46:38.740 --> 46:40.180
Grey's is a perfect example

46:40.180 --> 46:42.740
because I could watch 10 Kevin Hart videos before then

46:43.780 --> 46:44.660
and it would still-

46:44.660 --> 46:46.020
That's a lot, Griffin.

46:46.020 --> 46:47.700
That's a lot of Kevin Hart videos.

46:47.700 --> 46:51.700
Yeah, no, I would need to go to Grey's Anatomy Hospital,

46:51.700 --> 46:52.980
whatever it's called,

46:52.980 --> 46:54.660
to get them to sew up the stitches

46:55.700 --> 46:57.380
from the splits in my belly

46:57.380 --> 47:00.180
that I have from watching 10 Kevin Hart videos in a row.

47:01.060 --> 47:03.780
But then I would cry at the sad drama

47:03.780 --> 47:06.980
because a bus would crash into the hospital or something

47:07.540 --> 47:11.940
and it would cancel out all the Kevin Hart videos.

47:11.940 --> 47:12.440
Yeah.

47:13.220 --> 47:14.260
But isn't that important?

47:14.900 --> 47:16.340
Staying equalized.

47:16.340 --> 47:18.660
It's really is important.

47:18.660 --> 47:21.620
I think feeling the full spectrum of human emotion is key.

47:21.620 --> 47:22.180
Wouldn't it?

47:23.380 --> 47:26.980
Okay, listen, it's 2020 times they have a changed

47:27.780 --> 47:32.900
and I would like to announce here my change.org petition

47:32.900 --> 47:36.820
to remake the James Cameron Titanic

47:37.540 --> 47:40.820
and this time as the iceberg is coming,

47:40.820 --> 47:46.020
the ship transforms into a big transformer.

47:46.020 --> 47:48.500
The iceberg turns into a big-

47:48.500 --> 47:49.460
Yeah, this is fucking-

47:49.460 --> 47:50.900
Slow down, this is fucking cool.

47:50.900 --> 47:51.780
Yeah, this is cool, dude.

47:51.780 --> 47:56.020
It's not funny, but I feel like I'm at a fucking cool movie.

47:56.020 --> 47:56.980
Oh, this isn't-

47:56.980 --> 47:59.220
Sorry, I moved away from comedy podcasts

47:59.220 --> 48:01.460
to just like I'm pitching my new movie.

48:01.460 --> 48:04.020
No, I know, we don't do badass stuff on this podcast enough.

48:04.020 --> 48:05.220
So let's not do-

48:05.220 --> 48:06.740
Don't do any more jokes, Travis.

48:06.740 --> 48:07.860
Please tell me why-

48:07.860 --> 48:09.140
Actually, stop, stop.

48:09.700 --> 48:11.380
Start at the beginning of the movie.

48:11.380 --> 48:13.300
Shot one, what are we looking at here?

48:13.300 --> 48:15.620
Do we get to know that the Titanic is a transformer

48:15.620 --> 48:17.380
before this happens or what?

48:17.380 --> 48:18.820
No, up to this point,

48:18.820 --> 48:23.140
we have no idea that the ship is a transformer.

48:23.140 --> 48:24.740
So it's basically the same movie

48:24.740 --> 48:27.060
right up until the fateful collision,

48:27.060 --> 48:28.740
that one dark, cold night, okay.

48:28.740 --> 48:32.260
Yes, and then it's like the ship transforms

48:32.260 --> 48:33.780
and you're like, what, what is happening?

48:33.780 --> 48:35.700
But then the iceberg transforms too

48:35.700 --> 48:38.420
and the iceberg is the Decepticon, right?

48:38.420 --> 48:40.740
So now they're fighting, right?

48:40.740 --> 48:44.420
And meanwhile, Jack and Rose, who are together,

48:44.420 --> 48:46.100
and spoiler alert, they both live,

48:46.660 --> 48:50.900
they're inside of Titanic's head, right?

48:50.900 --> 48:53.700
Talking to him and they're kind of the buddies, right?

48:53.700 --> 48:54.740
And they're working together.

48:55.460 --> 48:59.620
And then Voltron shows up and Voltron's there

48:59.620 --> 49:01.140
and they're like, Voltron?

49:01.140 --> 49:03.940
And he's like, yeah, I gotta stop these Kaijus.

49:03.940 --> 49:04.820
I don't like it anymore.

49:05.380 --> 49:06.660
Wait, it comes back around.

49:07.300 --> 49:09.060
It's not gonna come back around.

49:09.060 --> 49:11.300
And then what's that?

49:11.300 --> 49:13.540
Is the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

49:13.540 --> 49:14.580
Stop, it's done.

49:15.140 --> 49:19.300
They were inside, the cars were inside Titanic's belly.

49:19.300 --> 49:20.580
Oh, hold on, I'm coming back.

49:21.300 --> 49:23.140
And they were like Titanic's baby.

49:23.140 --> 49:25.380
And then we have a long birthing scene

49:25.940 --> 49:31.220
where the iceberg is a trained.

49:31.220 --> 49:32.740
Listen, I'm not done.

49:32.740 --> 49:34.820
Iceberg is a trained OBGYN.

49:35.620 --> 49:39.220
And enemies become friends when Iceberg the Decepticon

49:39.220 --> 49:42.980
helps deliver Titanic's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers babies.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.060
And let me teach you with this, Travis, if you don't mind,

49:45.060 --> 49:49.300
we can bring in sort of the dino sort of aesthetic from that.

49:49.300 --> 49:50.340
And it can be called,

49:50.340 --> 49:53.300
and the Iceberg Decepticon can be called GinoBot.

49:53.300 --> 49:54.340
And he is a dinosaur.

49:54.340 --> 49:55.300
Ooh, yes, yes, yes.

49:55.300 --> 49:58.580
But he's gonna help open up the cargo bay, I guess,

49:58.580 --> 50:02.580
which would be like the, you know, the fallopian canal.

50:03.300 --> 50:06.820
It's been a while since I've rushed up on that stuff, but-

50:06.820 --> 50:07.780
No, you nailed it.

50:07.780 --> 50:10.100
And then Voltron uses his mighty space sword

50:10.100 --> 50:11.700
to cut the umbilical cord.

50:11.700 --> 50:12.740
I don't want Voltron there.

50:12.740 --> 50:13.860
We got, you can't cross-

50:13.860 --> 50:14.740
But he's a doula.

50:16.100 --> 50:18.180
I know Voltron's a trained doula, Travis.

50:19.780 --> 50:22.580
It's just, he would be so useful in this time, you know?

50:23.860 --> 50:24.500
I know.

50:24.500 --> 50:24.900
Doula.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.700
He's a doula.

50:27.060 --> 50:28.900
I think that's cool.

50:29.540 --> 50:31.620
And then after that fight, wait,

50:31.620 --> 50:33.060
do they keep fighting after the birth?

50:33.700 --> 50:38.100
Yeah, once the Megazord is out.

50:38.740 --> 50:39.460
Right.

50:39.460 --> 50:40.100
Yeah.

50:40.100 --> 50:42.340
Then they keep fighting, I assume Transformer wins.

50:42.340 --> 50:42.740
Okay.

50:42.740 --> 50:43.060
Yeah.

50:43.060 --> 50:46.260
And then do we see the ship continue its journey on

50:46.260 --> 50:49.700
for another couple hours until it docks in America safely?

50:49.700 --> 50:50.100
Yep.

50:50.100 --> 50:50.500
All right.

50:50.500 --> 50:53.700
But then America turns into a Decepticon.

50:53.700 --> 50:54.660
No, stop.

50:54.660 --> 50:55.300
It already did.

50:57.460 --> 50:59.460
That's how we set up the cliffhanger, Griffin,

50:59.460 --> 51:01.060
for Titanic 2, Titanic.

51:02.260 --> 51:04.660
Is there more Porkin then in the back half of the movie?

51:04.660 --> 51:05.620
Oh, yeah.

51:06.980 --> 51:07.480
Okay.

51:08.820 --> 51:09.140
But-

51:09.140 --> 51:09.940
Yeah.

51:09.940 --> 51:16.500
There's a long scene where Titanic and Voltron very sensuously make love.

51:16.500 --> 51:17.300
I don't like it.

51:17.300 --> 51:20.260
Is there one where Voltron and Billy Zane-

51:20.260 --> 51:24.420
I want Voltron and Billy Zane to figure out how that would work even.

51:24.420 --> 51:25.060
Oh, yeah.

51:25.060 --> 51:27.540
Well, that happens actually at the beginning of the-

51:27.540 --> 51:30.980
Sorry, there is now a new scene at the beginning of the movie

51:30.980 --> 51:34.340
where Billy Zane draws Voltron like one of his French girls.

51:34.340 --> 51:36.500
So then when it's referenced again later,

51:36.500 --> 51:40.420
now it's like, oh, you stole that from Billy Zane and Voltron.

51:40.420 --> 51:44.500
Yeah, I would love it if we could get Kathy Bates

51:44.500 --> 51:48.180
to have some sort of private scene with a huge robot.

51:48.180 --> 51:49.060
Oh, yeah.

51:49.060 --> 51:50.980
That would be fucking rad, dude.

51:50.980 --> 51:51.460
Yeah, dude.

51:52.180 --> 51:52.820
This version of the movie is way better.

51:52.820 --> 51:55.300
Do you think that Voltron is the last one of the great roles

51:55.300 --> 51:56.740
that Kathy Bates has yet to play?

51:59.780 --> 52:01.700
Like she's done so many of the great roles

52:01.700 --> 52:03.700
and it feels like Voltron's kind of the last one.

52:03.700 --> 52:04.660
She could film that for hours.

52:04.660 --> 52:06.740
If my agent called me with your pitch, Travis,

52:06.740 --> 52:08.500
I would be the whole time, pretend I'm Kathy Bates,

52:08.500 --> 52:11.460
I'd be like, yes, yes, loving it, loving it, loving it.

52:11.460 --> 52:15.380
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I will play Voltron.

52:15.380 --> 52:17.700
No, no, no, Kathy, you're actually a character in it.

52:17.700 --> 52:19.700
Kathy Bates is in it as Kathy Bates.

52:19.700 --> 52:20.580
No, absolutely not.

52:20.580 --> 52:21.780
I will play Kathy Bates.

52:21.780 --> 52:24.580
And then sort of in Norbis style,

52:24.580 --> 52:26.820
I will also play the Voltron in it.

52:26.820 --> 52:28.340
I will be the Kathy Bates and the Voltron.

52:28.340 --> 52:29.780
Now, not piloting Voltron.

52:29.780 --> 52:32.260
You're saying Voltron is Kathy Bates.

52:32.260 --> 52:33.940
It's a big, yeah, Kathy Bates.

52:33.940 --> 52:35.620
And we'll dress her up in cardboard boxes.

52:36.260 --> 52:38.420
That's not our department.

52:38.420 --> 52:38.980
That's not our thing.

52:38.980 --> 52:41.140
The whole thing, the whole bit, the whole bit.

52:41.140 --> 52:45.540
I should mention, Jack doesn't survive once they get to America,

52:45.540 --> 52:48.100
but it's for completely unrelated reasons.

52:48.100 --> 52:50.260
He falls coming off the ship like a dick shit.

52:50.260 --> 52:52.100
Well, Griffin, I-

52:52.100 --> 52:53.380
Sorry, oh, I forgot.

52:53.380 --> 52:54.340
Yeah, I don't want to spoil it,

52:54.340 --> 52:56.100
but he falls coming down the ramp and he slips,

52:56.100 --> 52:58.100
he falls and his whole head pops off.

52:58.100 --> 53:00.260
And everyone's like, what a fucking idiot.

53:00.260 --> 53:00.980
Yep.

53:00.980 --> 53:02.260
Did you see that?

53:02.260 --> 53:04.340
He made it all this way, oh God.

53:04.340 --> 53:06.660
And we put up signs that said, be careful.

53:08.020 --> 53:08.660
Slippery.

53:09.300 --> 53:10.420
Slippery Wind Voltron.

53:10.420 --> 53:11.060
Yep.

53:11.060 --> 53:12.100
That's the name of the movie.

53:13.140 --> 53:14.020
And this episode.

53:14.580 --> 53:17.620
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

53:18.340 --> 53:20.740
We very much appreciate you.

53:20.740 --> 53:23.300
We hope you're hanging in there and doing all right,

53:23.300 --> 53:24.420
you know, all things considered.

53:26.020 --> 53:28.740
We are well, you know, all things considered.

53:28.740 --> 53:32.900
So we hope that you can find a way to be so too.

53:34.340 --> 53:37.540
Promotioning things, anything in the tank.

53:38.820 --> 53:41.620
Oh, this is less a promotion and more of like,

53:41.620 --> 53:45.620
may I call by a guess, but DFTBA is of course,

53:45.620 --> 53:48.340
a big building filled with people.

53:48.340 --> 53:50.740
And so they have been quarantined as well.

53:50.740 --> 53:51.860
And people have been sent home.

53:51.860 --> 53:52.820
They don't work.

53:52.820 --> 53:55.380
So products might be delayed reaching you.

53:55.380 --> 53:56.980
If so, we're sorry.

53:56.980 --> 53:58.740
It's completely unexpected.

53:58.740 --> 54:01.140
And how do you even plan for something like that?

54:01.140 --> 54:03.060
But we'll eventually get to you.

54:03.060 --> 54:04.340
We're sorry for any delays.

54:07.140 --> 54:08.100
There's really not.

54:08.100 --> 54:09.460
I mean, thanks to John Roderick

54:09.460 --> 54:11.060
and the Long Winters for a theme song.

54:11.060 --> 54:13.140
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

54:14.660 --> 54:18.980
It's a great song and it's a great dude

54:18.980 --> 54:22.100
and a great maximum fun for having us on the network.

54:23.700 --> 54:26.180
They've got all kinds of wonderful shows on there.

54:26.180 --> 54:28.820
And we're so excited to be a part of it.

54:29.620 --> 54:32.500
And yeah, let's wrap it.

54:32.500 --> 54:34.100
If you're bored, we've been trying to put out

54:34.660 --> 54:37.300
like more stuff on our YouTube channel.

54:37.300 --> 54:37.780
Yes.

54:37.780 --> 54:41.380
Try to create something, anything for people to think about

54:41.380 --> 54:44.020
beyond just like being stuck at home.

54:44.020 --> 54:44.900
So you can check that out.

54:44.900 --> 54:46.260
McElroy Family on YouTube.

54:47.380 --> 54:48.820
Yeah, let's wrap it up.

54:48.820 --> 54:49.700
I got a final one here.

54:49.700 --> 54:51.860
This is a fun one.

54:51.860 --> 54:53.620
This one was sent in also by Graham Roebuck.

54:53.620 --> 54:54.100
Thank you, Graham.

54:54.100 --> 54:56.580
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

54:56.580 --> 54:59.220
Well, it's W-E-W-E, which I assume is just wee wee.

54:59.220 --> 55:03.700
Asked, turtle pregnancy.

55:04.820 --> 55:06.100
How do they do it?

55:09.620 --> 55:10.820
My name is Justin McElroy.

55:10.820 --> 55:11.780
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:11.780 --> 55:14.100
Like the shell doesn't get, like the shell can't get bigger.

55:14.100 --> 55:15.940
So like, where does it go?

55:15.940 --> 55:17.940
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:17.940 --> 55:19.140
This has been my brother, my brother and me.
