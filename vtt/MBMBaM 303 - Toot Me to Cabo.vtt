WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.800
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls from around the globe, it's my brother,

00:48.800 --> 00:53.360
my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era Eurovision special. My name is Justin McElroy.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.320
I'm the oldest brother. Oh, I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother. I'm your sweet baby

00:58.320 --> 01:02.480
brother Griffin McElroy. Justin, I love how you said Eurovision special really quick

01:02.480 --> 01:08.720
and under your breath as if to hide it. I didn't want it to be a big commitment

01:08.720 --> 01:13.600
because I don't want to talk about it that much. Oh folks, don't get it twisted. This bit might not

01:13.600 --> 01:20.080
work. And so Justin just left himself a little ripcord, a little parachute to get out of it

01:20.080 --> 01:23.920
if he needs to. What? I never said that. What are you talking about? I thought I was pressing the

01:23.920 --> 01:28.080
cough button. It's funny that you said that, Travis, because many of the performers in Eurovision

01:28.080 --> 01:36.640
2016, their acts involved parachutes of multiple kinds. Now, I did not watch Eurovision

01:36.640 --> 01:41.840
because I wanted to come at this Eurovision special with fresh eyes as our audience might.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.680
I want to be their window in. I want fresh data. Quite a sacrifice. Fresh, dumb, uninformed eyes.

01:47.680 --> 01:58.800
Exactly. So tell me it's people from countries that are not America singing songs. It's gotten

01:58.800 --> 02:05.360
to the point with the Eurovision contestants where it's starting to feel a bit intentional.

02:05.360 --> 02:10.800
Like it is not just Europe, but it's definitely not America. Like that's kind of becoming what

02:10.800 --> 02:17.680
they mean by this. Like they only let us watch it this year on the logo, which is such a perfect

02:17.680 --> 02:26.080
pairing for it. Here's the thing, fellas. I don't think they can keep America out for too long

02:26.080 --> 02:31.200
because we have a special way of getting what we want. We're a little bit of a juggernaut,

02:31.200 --> 02:36.880
I think would be the word I would use. I don't want to get dictatorial about it, but

02:36.880 --> 02:44.480
what baby want, a baby gonna get. If we levy sanctions against Europe so that we get to

02:44.480 --> 02:50.240
participate in Eurovision, maybe that's like the first act of whoever's president in 2017.

02:50.240 --> 02:56.320
If we already weren't embargoing them in some way to get me up on that stage. Here's the thing,

02:56.320 --> 03:04.720
my boys, my brother boys. I recently came to the sad realization that even if I started right now

03:04.720 --> 03:09.600
and I started working real, real hard and I quit both of my jobs, all of my jobs, my many jobs,

03:09.600 --> 03:17.680
I quit all of them and I just dedicated myself to sport, I probably will not be able to qualify

03:17.680 --> 03:22.640
for the Rio Olympics in 2016. How many months away is that?

03:23.520 --> 03:28.400
Like one. And I was really thinking about like maybe there's some loophole, maybe there's some

03:28.400 --> 03:32.640
sport I haven't thought of that if I just really put my nose to the grindstone for 30 days,

03:32.640 --> 03:39.600
I could get Olympics good at. Is there like a beanbag cornhole in the Olympics this year?

03:39.600 --> 03:45.200
If there was baggos in the Olympics, and God knows I've been petitioning the council for that

03:45.200 --> 03:52.400
for a long time, but no, sadly, no. My best chance is beach volleyball and that's even way beyond mine.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.040
Even that, those dudes are like nine feet tall. Yeah, and the women are nine feet tall,

03:57.040 --> 03:59.120
everyone's nine feet tall, it's a nightmare. Everyone's nine feet tall.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.680
And all the dudes got that surgery to sew up all their various cracks and holes

04:03.680 --> 04:08.800
to prevent sand infiltration. And to prevent ball passage through.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.880
They've made themselves into human kites, essentially. Yeah, basically.

04:12.880 --> 04:19.440
So the situation is such that I will not, this is my formal announcement,

04:19.440 --> 04:23.920
I will not be attending and competing in the Rio Olympics 2016 games.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.920
Even if invited? If invited, you know I'll be there.

04:27.920 --> 04:32.000
Okay, this is a boycott. He's not a cad.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.120
No, it's just I don't think I'll be able to do sport that good.

04:35.120 --> 04:39.040
So my whole thing is now I'm turning my attention to just what the next thing will be,

04:39.040 --> 04:44.480
and I think the next thing will be me representing America in Eurovision 2017,

04:44.480 --> 04:50.880
singing my song about patriotism or whatever the situation is in 2017.

04:50.880 --> 04:55.200
Here's what I'm confused by, because it seems like there's a structure already in place

04:55.200 --> 05:00.880
of like everybody's got their own idol, American idol, Canadian idol, you know,

05:00.880 --> 05:04.000
Britain X Factor, whatever they call it over there.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.520
It feels like it should be like the Miss America pageant,

05:07.520 --> 05:12.480
where everybody like wins their idol, and then we have like a world idol.

05:12.480 --> 05:17.840
It is essentially like there's the UK's dudes were these two dudes that were on The Voice,

05:17.840 --> 05:21.280
and they competed against each other on The Voice, and they were bitter rivals.

05:21.280 --> 05:26.240
But then I think, much like in a Japanese visual novel,

05:26.240 --> 05:27.440
these two pretty- Or the Mighty Ducks.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.080
These two pretty boys- Nope, not exactly like the Mighty Ducks.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.000
I was doing a Japanese visual novel joke because these two very pretty boys fell in love,

05:34.640 --> 05:37.440
and I don't think that happens in D1, D2, or D3.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.600
Tidbit? Hold on.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.480
Hold on, wait.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.640
Charlie and Banks.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.200
I'm writing notes right now that say

05:45.200 --> 05:51.920
Mighty Ducks, Japanese visual novel, any boy slash any boy.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.240
Okay, we got that one filed away for later.

05:55.840 --> 06:00.000
Can I please do this?

06:02.800 --> 06:05.360
Can Griffin just be for America?

06:05.360 --> 06:07.040
Can Griffin just do this?

06:07.040 --> 06:08.160
I promise not to fuck it up.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.000
Like a lot of those boys got up there,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.320
and it was only the boys that fucked it up, I feel like.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.480
Yeah. Because the boys would get up there,

06:14.480 --> 06:17.360
and they had a guitar.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.920
And once I saw a guitar, I was like, I'm not going to enjoy this.

06:19.920 --> 06:25.360
What I want is a woman in a dress made out of crystals and light,

06:26.080 --> 06:27.920
and then she does a Final Fantasy summon.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.320
Those were the best ones.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.600
Those are the best ones.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.000
The Ukraine did one where she was dancing and light came out of her feet,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.680
and then she sucked up all the light in the entire stadium.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.760
All the light flew into her body,

06:41.760 --> 06:46.240
and she was glowing, and then she scream sang a sad dirge into the air,

06:46.240 --> 06:50.880
and a tree made out Yggdrasil fucking barfed out of her mouth

06:50.880 --> 06:53.200
and filled the place with life and beauty.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.240
And that's kind of, I think, the style I would go for.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.760
Travis, they've been doing this for 60 years,

06:59.760 --> 07:03.040
and it only now occurred to them that maybe they could let us watch

07:03.040 --> 07:07.600
this amazing spectacle that they have been hiding from us for all this time,

07:07.600 --> 07:10.560
because they were afraid, rightfully so, that we would ruin it.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.760
Griffin, step by step, what would your performance be?

07:13.760 --> 07:14.880
Walk us through it.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.600
So just based on the Eurovision I did watch,

07:18.160 --> 07:19.920
it would involve whatever song I sang.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.480
Is there a song that has two key changes?

07:22.480 --> 07:23.760
How many does Man in the Mirror have?

07:24.560 --> 07:26.320
It's got, it can't be previously published.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.040
That's one of the rules.

07:27.040 --> 07:27.520
Oh, really?

07:27.520 --> 07:32.880
Okay, what about Boy in the Reflective Surface?

07:33.440 --> 07:33.680
Okay.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.640
I'm contemplating the boy in the rockage of us.

07:38.640 --> 07:43.680
I'm wondering if we could do things a little differently.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.680
Make that transition.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.200
Switch it up.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.720
There was, I can't remember, I think it was Croatia had this thing,

07:52.720 --> 07:53.840
where she looked dope.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.640
I think it was Croatia who looked like Robin, essentially.

07:56.640 --> 08:00.640
And she came out and she's wearing like a kind of a big kimono situation.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.160
And then there are four monks there.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.560
And the four monks did nothing.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.440
They just stood behind her.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.080
But at one point, two of them came up and tore her dress apart,

08:08.080 --> 08:11.120
and she was wearing a better, even cooler armor dress underneath.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.680
So like definitely, definitely something like that.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.680
Whatever I do, it's going to be opulent.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.480
That's for certain.

08:16.480 --> 08:21.440
And it's going to involve the consumption and expulsion of light

08:21.440 --> 08:22.880
from every pore on my body.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.080
One of the coolest things, or the craziest things,

08:26.080 --> 08:28.720
or however you want to say it about Eurovision,

08:28.720 --> 08:34.160
is that they have, there are like 26 competitors in the finals.

08:34.160 --> 08:38.480
And 10 of the, like 20 of those are from semifinals.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.680
One is from the host country.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.960
And five of them are the UK, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.200
Because they give the most money, so they always get to be there.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.000
They get to be, yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.800
That's fucking, that's so good.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.440
I like that much transparency in a thing.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.680
It's just like, hey, this is what's up.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.240
I hope one day one of the countries abuses it.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.320
And just like, here is our song.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.600
It's called Time for Fun.

09:00.160 --> 09:00.660
Enjoy.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.480
You must listen.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.600
It's a finalist.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.680
It is called A Time for Fart.

09:05.680 --> 09:10.320
It's just, there's not even notes.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.520
It's just pfft, pfft, pfft.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.680
Were you doing Gru from Despicable Me?

09:13.680 --> 09:15.120
I don't know what country he's from,

09:15.120 --> 09:16.640
but that's what you sounded like.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.400
It was just generically European.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.200
Okay.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.360
Generically European.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.920
One thing I will say though,

09:23.920 --> 09:28.320
I do hope we can get announcers that aren't quite as scandalous

09:29.200 --> 09:31.440
next year for our American Commentation.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.400
At one point, a very attractive young man was,

09:36.400 --> 09:39.040
they said that he was openly bisexual.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.280
And then one of the commentators said,

09:41.280 --> 09:46.480
so everybody gets a turn and I'm not sure that's how that works.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.040
No.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.160
I'm not sure that's what that means.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.240
And maybe they were confused because they saw the person

09:54.240 --> 09:56.800
and thought they were, you know, a carnival ride.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.520
Or maybe I misheard and they thought,

09:59.520 --> 10:01.760
they said he's open with his bicycle.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.200
So everybody can ride his bicycle.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.680
And now, welcome to the stage,

10:07.680 --> 10:10.720
a pile of orifices that can sing real nice.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.200
I don't think that's how it works, Carson.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.760
Anyway, Eurovision Song Contest was amazing.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.200
Catch you in 2017.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.000
I'm gonna be there.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.280
I still won't be allowed to perform,

10:19.280 --> 10:21.280
but if they are, Griffin is ready to answer the call.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.560
I would like Griffin to perform

10:22.560 --> 10:24.800
and I would like Justin and I to commentate

10:24.800 --> 10:26.800
because there would just be a lot of this.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.300
What?

10:28.320 --> 10:28.800
What?

10:28.800 --> 10:29.680
Over and over again.

10:29.680 --> 10:30.800
He's amazing.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.520
If they don't let the US in, I'm fucking moving to Croatia

10:35.520 --> 10:38.640
and I'm gonna make the connections I need to make.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.480
I'm gonna grease the right wheels,

10:40.480 --> 10:41.600
grease the right elbows.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.920
By the way, just like YouTube Eurovision like greatest

10:45.920 --> 10:47.680
or Eurovision weirdest or your,

10:47.680 --> 10:48.960
if you have no idea what we're talking about,

10:48.960 --> 10:50.400
please seek this out.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.080
This is like high quality entertainment.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.920
Anyway, it's not as high quality as the show

10:53.920 --> 10:54.800
we've got prepared for you.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.720
So let's get to it.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.400
My girlfriend and I just moved to a new city

10:58.400 --> 11:00.320
where we only know a single person.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.600
We like this person

11:01.600 --> 11:03.920
and she has gladly welcomed us into her group of friends.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.200
The trouble is she and her friends

11:05.200 --> 11:07.040
are all salaried software developers

11:07.040 --> 11:08.560
of big tech companies.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.720
My girlfriend and I are artists currently working hourly.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.000
We like hanging out with these people,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.560
but they often end up at bars, restaurants, et cetera,

11:14.560 --> 11:15.920
that are a bit over our budget.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.240
Even game nights can get pricier than we like

11:18.240 --> 11:20.800
once we order takeout from their favorite nice places.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.720
Brothers, how do we trick our well-to-do friends

11:22.720 --> 11:25.600
into adopting our penny pinching lifestyle

11:25.600 --> 11:28.560
that's from not so salaried in Seattle?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.840
This is really a very tough question.

11:31.840 --> 11:32.560
It really is.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.520
It's a hard one to start out.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.920
We could have started with a softball scraps.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.640
Nope.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.800
Hey, this is 303.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.360
This is volume two, no more softballs.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.360
I've reached a...

11:44.240 --> 11:45.120
I don't know how to talk about this

11:45.120 --> 11:47.120
without sounding like a complete asshole,

11:47.120 --> 11:53.280
but I don't really care so much

11:53.280 --> 11:56.640
about the exchange of finances anymore

11:56.640 --> 12:01.120
when it comes to a hang sesh or a dinner with friends.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.600
And I think it's just because I'm doing better than I did

12:03.600 --> 12:04.880
when we started doing this podcast

12:04.880 --> 12:06.960
and I was absolutely coming from the other way.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.560
And I was like, oh, when you split the check,

12:08.560 --> 12:09.360
it's not right.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.280
One person eats a steak, one person eats salad.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.960
To me, it's harder for me to get a hang sesh

12:16.960 --> 12:18.160
going with my group of friends.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.600
And so this stuff doesn't matter as much to me anymore,

12:21.600 --> 12:23.840
which I know is not helpful to hear.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.920
I mean, it's a little bit, I'm with you.

12:25.920 --> 12:26.640
I understand what you're saying.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.480
It's also kind of a privileged position.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.200
It's a privileged position,

12:29.200 --> 12:31.440
but the point I'm trying to make is like,

12:31.440 --> 12:33.760
I bet to your friends,

12:33.760 --> 12:37.120
it doesn't matter as much that you cannot contribute

12:37.120 --> 12:39.520
as much to the hang session.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.720
But that's just like,

12:40.720 --> 12:43.200
I feel like that's how our group of friends operates.

12:43.920 --> 12:44.480
I feel you.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.920
Cause every so often,

12:45.920 --> 12:47.600
I find myself in a position

12:47.600 --> 12:49.600
where I'm able to cover something

12:49.600 --> 12:51.040
where I'm like, I've got it.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.320
Dinner's on me, right?

12:52.960 --> 12:56.560
And you'll occasionally see the other person

12:56.560 --> 12:58.960
kind of do that little bit of like slump shoulder.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.000
Like, I feel bad that I can't contribute.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.400
And it makes me happy to cover the thing

13:04.400 --> 13:05.280
and it doesn't,

13:05.280 --> 13:08.240
or if someone's like, just says outright,

13:08.240 --> 13:10.240
like, hey, could we go somewhere else?

13:10.240 --> 13:11.760
Like, this is a little out of my price range.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.120
I'm never gonna judge them for it.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.800
No, I'm totally fine with that too.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.920
At my point, it's just like,

13:15.920 --> 13:19.440
I am so psyched when I can get a board game sesh

13:19.440 --> 13:21.520
together with my friends because-

13:21.520 --> 13:22.240
You're saying sesh a lot.

13:22.240 --> 13:22.560
Huh?

13:22.560 --> 13:23.680
You're saying sesh a lot.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.680
Am I saying sesh a lot?

13:25.680 --> 13:26.720
Like, okay.

13:26.720 --> 13:27.360
I'll dial it back.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.160
Whenever I'm having a fucking box social with my buds,

13:33.360 --> 13:34.720
like, I get so excited to,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.040
that that event has come together

13:37.040 --> 13:38.960
that like, I just like, I don't really,

13:39.920 --> 13:40.480
I don't really,

13:41.200 --> 13:43.120
I just don't care if I get dinner.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.240
And then that's not coming from like,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.560
hmm, my treat, hmm, come together.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.480
People feast upon my genera-

13:48.480 --> 13:49.920
It's not that, it's just like,

13:49.920 --> 13:50.880
I don't give a shit about that.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.480
The more important thing to me is like,

13:52.480 --> 13:55.440
I'm happy that we all got together.

13:55.440 --> 13:55.940
So like-

13:57.200 --> 13:59.040
One thing you can try is that like,

13:59.040 --> 14:01.200
if everybody goes through different times,

14:01.200 --> 14:02.160
they have a bit more money

14:02.160 --> 14:04.400
and there's other ways that like,

14:04.400 --> 14:05.360
your friends can contribute.

14:05.360 --> 14:10.240
So sometimes we'll go out with like,

14:10.240 --> 14:12.080
a couple friend and you know,

14:12.080 --> 14:14.480
we'll, I'll cover the check

14:14.480 --> 14:16.080
or Sid and I will cover the check.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.440
And then after the meal,

14:17.440 --> 14:20.080
I'll look at the husband and I'll say,

14:20.080 --> 14:21.200
and no, I will help you-

14:21.200 --> 14:21.920
No, come on.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.400
Yeah.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.880
No, but listen, hear me out.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.680
I don't want to hear,

14:25.680 --> 14:27.120
no, I specifically interrupted you

14:27.120 --> 14:28.400
because I didn't want to hear you out.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.240
I guess one thing you could try-

14:30.240 --> 14:32.400
Hold on, I want to see where he's going with this.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.320
No, I will have a little woman.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.560
Like, I'll try, like, you say it like that.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.760
Like Zon- like Zon-Geef.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.640
You say it like Zon-Geef?

14:41.520 --> 14:44.560
No, I will have your woman.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.320
Okay, let me give a secondary.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.520
Okay, you're doing the drag.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.800
I feel like that one got outvoted.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.300
Yeah.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.200
You're both artists.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.320
Congratulations.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.600
This problem has been solved.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.440
Courtesy of yours truly,

14:55.440 --> 14:57.120
Justin McElroy, the king of device.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.960
Next time everybody, they get their,

14:58.960 --> 15:03.280
what is it, Sesame Chicken Wings,

15:03.280 --> 15:04.480
Pho, what is it?

15:04.480 --> 15:05.520
It's like a good takeout.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.560
Like what's fancy takeout?

15:06.560 --> 15:08.480
I only have like eight different Papa John's here.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.480
But like you have Pho takeout,

15:10.480 --> 15:11.600
you're just like eating your-

15:11.600 --> 15:13.360
Now what is Pho takeout?

15:13.360 --> 15:16.320
Is that like the restaurant is somehow your rival,

15:16.320 --> 15:18.800
your enemy, and they challenge you to eat their food?

15:18.800 --> 15:19.920
I don't know what Pho is,

15:19.920 --> 15:20.640
but a lot of people are-

15:20.640 --> 15:21.680
Well, it's nothing.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.560
It's Pho.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.280
You mean Pho.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.720
Pho?

15:24.720 --> 15:25.600
Yeah, dog.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.560
What?

15:26.560 --> 15:29.120
The O has like a fun line over it.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.480
That sounds like you're gonna finish a word

15:32.480 --> 15:34.480
and like bail halfway through, like Pho.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.080
Can I get some fun soup?

15:36.080 --> 15:36.880
All right, let me try.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.560
Let's say you're getting like really nice pizza

15:40.560 --> 15:44.000
and you get like, they order from a place that puts like gold in it

15:44.000 --> 15:45.600
and you are eating it.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.120
And as you're eating it, because you're an artist,

15:49.120 --> 15:51.600
you can just look at the person who picks up the check

15:51.600 --> 15:55.040
and say, congratulations, you're now a patron of the arts.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.320
Cause that, think about it.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.600
They're helping to support putting more artistic works

15:59.600 --> 16:03.040
out into the world because they're helping to keep you fed.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.800
They're giving you pizza fuel so that you can make artworks.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.680
If you're an artist, you are never mooching.

16:09.680 --> 16:14.160
You are allowing patronage to occur.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.840
It's a beautiful system that's been in place

16:15.840 --> 16:17.040
since the middle ages.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.440
And who are we to upset that particular alcove?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.760
Take a pepperoni off the za and especially one

16:21.760 --> 16:23.600
that has a pool of grease in it.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.560
And then you take a parchment and then you do a little doodle.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.320
Look at this political cartoon I made.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.960
You take two of the garlic breadsticks

16:30.960 --> 16:33.600
and you stick forks in them like Penny and June.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.600
And you say, look, I do performance art.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.720
You just help pay for it.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.640
And then you just eat the breadsticks.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.960
It also, if it comes down to it,

16:40.960 --> 16:44.480
maybe you plan an event every so often

16:44.480 --> 16:46.400
and try to work that into the rotation

16:46.400 --> 16:48.080
of you guys all hanging out.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.920
Then you have a little bit more control over

16:50.640 --> 16:52.400
what the cost of everything is

16:52.400 --> 16:54.000
and what the spending of everything is.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.320
And-

16:54.320 --> 16:56.320
But this, this hard thing is like,

16:57.440 --> 16:58.400
I know what you're saying, Trav,

16:58.400 --> 17:01.360
but like the hard thing is like, it's also not,

17:02.560 --> 17:04.080
I mean, this is shitty, but like,

17:04.080 --> 17:05.520
this is such a pervasive thing.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.080
Like this happens for a lot of people who are like,

17:08.080 --> 17:11.360
everybody's at the same social economic strata

17:11.360 --> 17:14.080
in college, basically, because, or, you know,

17:14.080 --> 17:15.120
high school and college, because like,

17:16.400 --> 17:17.760
everybody's doing, nobody has a job.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.640
Like nobody has a job.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.800
And then it gets like stratified over the years after it.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.840
And it's like, it's not fair for this couple to like,

17:26.400 --> 17:28.080
try to get everybody to do something

17:29.040 --> 17:31.360
that is like less expensive.

17:31.360 --> 17:31.920
You know what I mean?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.440
Like, cause it's not a concern to them.

17:33.440 --> 17:36.320
I think the bigger, the bigger issue is in that,

17:36.320 --> 17:37.360
in that first sentence of the question,

17:37.360 --> 17:38.560
when they say they just moved here

17:38.560 --> 17:40.720
and they really only know one of these folks.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.920
And so like, I feel like,

17:43.200 --> 17:45.360
I've never stopped hanging out with somebody

17:45.360 --> 17:49.360
because we were in different economic strata or whatever,

17:50.320 --> 17:53.440
but I can understand how that discomfort could be magnified

17:53.440 --> 17:56.320
based on the fact that you are new to this group.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.560
And so it's sort of, yeah.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.720
It's a little bit harder to be like,

18:01.520 --> 18:04.080
I can't afford it and not expect a judgment

18:04.080 --> 18:05.600
cause you don't know these people as well.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.040
I still don't think there'll be any judgment,

18:07.040 --> 18:08.880
unless these people are like complete jags.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.000
There won't be judgment.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.920
It'll be self-inflicted, right?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.760
It's an emotional toll it takes on you.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.680
Like, cause you do feel that way.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.040
Like even if the other people don't care,

18:17.600 --> 18:19.280
like I think people like, I like,

18:20.640 --> 18:22.880
I look for opportunities where I can like,

18:24.320 --> 18:25.360
do this kind of stuff

18:25.360 --> 18:27.440
because I like taking care of people,

18:27.440 --> 18:28.800
but I know that that also has like,

18:31.120 --> 18:33.680
you know, some people that sort of grates on them.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.280
And you know, I also bet that like these people

18:37.280 --> 18:39.360
look at you with a tinge of jealousy

18:39.360 --> 18:41.120
because you guys get to like create art

18:41.120 --> 18:43.360
and like, they may love their jobs,

18:43.360 --> 18:45.280
but like wish that they could be artists

18:45.280 --> 18:46.400
and you know, that kind of thing.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.400
Like everybody has something in their lives

18:48.400 --> 18:50.560
that everybody else looks at and goes,

18:50.560 --> 18:51.840
I wish I could do that.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.320
Yeah.

18:52.320 --> 18:52.960
You know what I mean?

18:52.960 --> 18:54.960
So it's not like their lives are perfect

18:54.960 --> 18:57.040
and you guys are not doing it, right?

18:57.040 --> 18:58.640
Just everybody has a different path.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.240
A lot of people look at me and they say,

19:00.240 --> 19:03.920
I wish I could sing and spin at the same time

19:03.920 --> 19:06.320
like Griffin does for his Eurovision performance.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.920
And I say, it's really hard to do

19:07.920 --> 19:09.600
because like a lot of people can sing,

19:09.600 --> 19:11.600
a lot of people can spin, doing both at once.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.760
It's really tricky.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.440
Can I move on to this,

19:15.440 --> 19:17.200
as long as we're talking about fungible financial,

19:18.000 --> 19:18.960
fungible matters.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.560
I'd love to discuss a relevant.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.960
That was my favorite TGIF show.

19:22.960 --> 19:23.840
Fungible matters.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.560
Everywhere you look,

19:26.560 --> 19:28.720
that's not the theme song to Family Matters.

19:28.720 --> 19:32.480
This one was sent in by Rob Van Lipwig.

19:32.480 --> 19:32.960
Thank you, Rob.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.480
Oh, okay.

19:37.280 --> 19:37.840
Well, okay.

19:38.640 --> 19:38.960
All right.

19:38.960 --> 19:43.600
So this Yahoo Answers user has BRAC as their user icon.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.200
So I got really excited about what the name would be,

19:45.200 --> 19:46.160
but then I hovered over it

19:46.160 --> 19:48.320
and the name is BRAC Hates Hillary Clinton.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.200
No.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.240
Okay.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.040
Which I don't know.

19:51.040 --> 19:51.760
I don't think that's,

19:52.720 --> 19:54.320
I think you may be projecting a little bit.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.120
Anyway, this person says,

19:57.120 --> 19:59.200
how would you handle students

19:59.200 --> 20:02.000
who charge your son or daughter $1

20:02.560 --> 20:05.840
each time he or she farts in class?

20:05.840 --> 20:07.680
That's so open.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.960
That's what you're going to say.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.560
You were hoping I was,

20:10.560 --> 20:11.360
you were,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.600
at what point did you start hoping for that?

20:14.800 --> 20:16.640
He waited with bated breath.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.000
How would you handle students

20:18.000 --> 20:20.160
who charge your son or daughter $1

20:20.160 --> 20:22.640
each time he or she farts in class?

20:22.640 --> 20:24.640
I love this because I think-

20:24.640 --> 20:25.920
Oh, you love this.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.440
Well, there's an inherent implication

20:27.440 --> 20:29.440
that it has happened enough

20:29.440 --> 20:32.000
that they had to establish punitive measures.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.560
Yeah.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.280
Well, this was like the swear jar in the office.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.040
That it was like, no, you know what, Derek?

20:37.040 --> 20:37.520
Fine.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.080
You want to do it every time it's a dollar.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.120
Now, do you want to do it?

20:41.120 --> 20:42.320
Oh, you're still doing it.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.120
$5.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.680
I would want this because this could turn into

20:47.680 --> 20:52.800
a very weird potentially profitable form of bullying.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.720
Potentially profitable form of bullying

20:56.000 --> 20:59.760
because if in the wrong hands,

20:59.760 --> 21:02.400
this law keeper would just be like,

21:02.400 --> 21:03.920
I heard that cheesy blaster.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.560
Give me a buck.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.840
And it's like, I didn't, I didn't.

21:05.840 --> 21:06.880
Guys, I didn't.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.840
I didn't blast one.

21:07.840 --> 21:08.560
That wasn't me.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.120
These are a little higher pitch.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.240
That's how you can tell.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.600
I would almost want this to be

21:13.600 --> 21:15.280
either like an elected position

21:15.280 --> 21:17.040
or like a captain of the safety patrol.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.400
Maybe just the captain of the safety patrol

21:18.400 --> 21:19.440
is the one that does it.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.280
The question is,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.920
is it everybody is held to the same standard

21:23.920 --> 21:25.440
or is it just one kid?

21:26.080 --> 21:26.320
Right.

21:26.320 --> 21:30.320
Can he buy somebody else's carbon offset credits

21:30.320 --> 21:32.560
to like blow some more

21:32.560 --> 21:34.320
if they aren't particularly tooty?

21:34.880 --> 21:35.840
That's a good point.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.160
Another form of corruption is you just bribe

21:39.120 --> 21:43.680
the justicar and say like,

21:43.680 --> 21:45.920
how about you let me get off scot-free?

21:45.920 --> 21:47.280
I'll give you five for 10.

21:47.280 --> 21:51.040
I also wonder if you can like,

21:52.560 --> 21:54.160
if you do pay the dollar,

21:54.160 --> 21:56.480
that's the system that's been put in place here.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.920
If you do pay the dollar,

21:57.920 --> 22:03.600
do you then get to fart without any sort of like shame?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.360
Like you pay ahead, you pay it forward.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.960
You say like, here's 10 for the day.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.000
Leave me alone.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.480
I'm just gonna be ripped nonstop.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.240
Here's a GameStop pre-order

22:12.240 --> 22:16.800
for the fart I'm gonna do at 3.15 p.m. today.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.800
Look forward to that.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.840
Where does the money go?

22:19.840 --> 22:22.320
Do you think it just goes into a pool for the whole class

22:22.320 --> 22:26.080
or is there one specific kid who's fucking this?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.440
Fucking Cedar Point.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.000
It's like a big class trip.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.760
It's like, damn, thanks, Michael.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.680
Keep eating that fibrous food, my boy.

22:35.680 --> 22:42.160
I'm glad you like that hummus, Michael.

22:42.160 --> 22:47.120
Damn, Michael, I'm having a fun time on this roller coaster.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.920
Glad you're lactose intolerant as fuck, Mikey.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.320
I wish Mikey could have been here with us

23:00.320 --> 23:02.240
on this roller coaster trip he paid for,

23:02.240 --> 23:08.240
but unfortunately his parents had to sell their house.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.160
He dung tooted their savings away.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.600
The law's the law.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.280
This kid's tooting me at a house at home.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.320
I wish it was up to me.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.240
Man, this is the best fart trip we've ever been on, guys.

23:18.800 --> 23:23.440
Next year, let's really up all the sort of high protein beanie foods

23:23.440 --> 23:25.120
and let's get to Cabo.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.800
We had a great time, Ms. Frizzle.

23:26.800 --> 23:34.800
Oh, Ms. Frizzle, let's fart our way to Cabo.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.040
What if the teacher had to pay?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.320
What's the only one?

23:38.320 --> 23:41.120
Like any time someone in the class farted,

23:41.120 --> 23:43.760
the teacher was the one paying the tax.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.240
What sense does that make?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.760
Teachers are already not making enough money.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.720
And now they're having to pay for their students' toots?

23:52.720 --> 23:55.840
I think it's like cab rules, right?

23:55.840 --> 23:57.520
Like they have to hang signs up in cabs now

23:57.520 --> 23:59.120
because human beings are awful.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.760
And it's like, hey, I have to drive around in this car all day.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.760
Just don't, please don't.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.760
I think the teachers operate by the same rule set.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.840
Like you can move on in third period,

24:07.840 --> 24:09.840
you get to leave and go study science,

24:09.840 --> 24:13.280
but your specter hangs out here in this room

24:13.280 --> 24:14.320
I have to be in all day.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.680
I think the teacher gets a buck.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.240
I think a teacher gets the buck.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.920
Well, they're definitely getting their beeg way

24:19.920 --> 24:21.520
in this whole you pay a buck for it.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.200
Like maybe they're getting a quarter per buck.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.440
Oh, they're definitely getting the juice somewhere.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.280
Yeah, the Vig.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.880
It's going towards their 401k, you know what I mean?

24:30.880 --> 24:33.280
I'm worried we've been indelicate.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.360
I'm worried we've been indelicate

24:35.360 --> 24:38.480
because I'm looking at the answers that people have said

24:38.480 --> 24:40.720
and they're all very concerned.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.400
I would talk to the school.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.480
Any act of being mean or extorting another student

24:44.480 --> 24:45.840
is being an actual bully.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.120
If the school principal won't do anything,

24:47.120 --> 24:47.920
go to the school board.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.440
If they won't do anything, raise hell.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.680
Start calling news stations and create a Facebook post

24:51.680 --> 24:52.640
on the school site.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.480
Try to get, oh, thanks dad.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.960
Oh, my flatulent son is getting bullied so bad.

25:04.880 --> 25:10.480
Next on WCHS news, this cave farts a bunch.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.920
Oh my God, you all, you wouldn't believe it.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.440
Anyway, this is bullying

25:15.440 --> 25:17.360
and not just like a once or twice thing.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.960
That's the thing.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.640
Just so we get it right on the lower third,

25:20.640 --> 25:22.880
the last name is Stinkmeister.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.480
No, I told you already.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.320
That's not it.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.680
It's Stonkenmeester.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.680
Stonkenmeester, please.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.680
I don't know which side of this I come down on.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.960
I feel like, Justin, you're a parent now.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.800
Yeah, I kind of feel like it depends

25:38.800 --> 25:40.560
on how the bully comports himself.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.720
Like I feel like if it's very,

25:42.720 --> 25:46.720
if it's like, give me a dollar 40, it's bad.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.120
But if he's like, listen, I hate that.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.880
I hate that I have to do this.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.480
But you know, it's out of my hands.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.840
What if he's got a little like green visor

25:55.840 --> 25:57.920
and like some like sleeve garters

25:57.920 --> 25:58.960
and every time there's a fart,

25:58.960 --> 26:00.240
he just like taps it into

26:00.240 --> 26:02.480
like a paper calculator printer thing

26:02.480 --> 26:03.600
and like pulls out a handle

26:03.600 --> 26:04.880
and he's like, that's one more.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.680
And it's not, there's no bullying to it whatsoever.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.400
This is just like a matter of fact,

26:10.400 --> 26:12.400
exchange of goods and services.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.760
You fart, it's a dollar period.

26:13.760 --> 26:17.120
What's the punishment if you don't pay up though?

26:17.120 --> 26:17.920
Prison?

26:17.920 --> 26:18.960
They break your legs.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.840
Oh God.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.200
Oh yeah, yeah, they break your legs.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.160
What if you have a chair that just like squeaks weird?

26:25.040 --> 26:28.320
Okay, let me pose this to you guys.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.120
Travel back in time in your minds

26:31.120 --> 26:32.560
to when you were in like middle school,

26:32.560 --> 26:33.920
high school, elementary school.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.720
Yeah.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.120
If you knew you could pay a dollar

26:37.840 --> 26:42.000
and if you paid, you would receive no ridicule for farting.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.200
This is what I was saying, Travis.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.880
Like this is what I'm saying.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.560
I think it's worth it

26:46.560 --> 26:49.200
if it's like, I don't have to lie about this.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.480
I don't have to fucking be ashamed.

26:51.120 --> 26:55.280
One time a kid pretended that I farted in class

26:55.280 --> 26:59.680
and it was, this kid pretended that I farted in class

26:59.680 --> 27:00.720
and he was a friend of mine

27:00.720 --> 27:02.400
but he pretended that I farted in class

27:02.400 --> 27:04.160
after I think he farted.

27:04.160 --> 27:07.920
And I got so mad at him that I picked up a pencil

27:07.920 --> 27:09.520
and jammed it into his thigh.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.240
Jesus.

27:10.240 --> 27:15.840
And I got, had a little bit of trouble with the higher ups.

27:17.200 --> 27:17.920
But like-

27:17.920 --> 27:19.200
That whole thing could have been avoided

27:19.200 --> 27:20.800
with the proper exchange of-

27:20.800 --> 27:22.320
If I could have been like, yeah, I guess so.

27:22.880 --> 27:23.920
Pay the man.

27:23.920 --> 27:24.240
Yeah.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.920
Pay the man his fart money.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.240
Like fart bounties could be,

27:28.240 --> 27:30.480
could really help to eliminate the embarrassment.

27:30.480 --> 27:30.960
Right?

27:30.960 --> 27:32.480
You can just do it because it's human.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.120
You should have to pay a price.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.400
There should be a price.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.760
You're admitting,

27:37.760 --> 27:40.800
this would be a great way to teach kids about the carbon tax though.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.360
Like, yes, I understand that you have to admit these gases.

27:43.360 --> 27:47.280
You are going to pay for what you've admitted into our lungs.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.520
I just think that there's a whole sliding scale

27:49.520 --> 27:51.680
you could set up to pay off,

27:51.680 --> 27:57.440
like what is your penance to pay off embarrassment tax in school?

27:57.440 --> 27:58.640
Where it's just like,

27:58.640 --> 28:01.440
oh, like I, whatever,

28:01.440 --> 28:03.120
feeling that I farted in class

28:03.120 --> 28:05.920
or like I accidentally called the teacher mommy.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.560
You know what I mean?

28:06.560 --> 28:09.120
Here's $2 and now I can't get made fun of.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.560
That would actually be a great equalizer

28:10.560 --> 28:13.440
for this fungible strata that we discussed earlier.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.240
Because like, if there's a kid in your class who's like really rich,

28:16.240 --> 28:18.720
then you could just assume that they need all that money

28:18.720 --> 28:20.960
to pay off like the farts that they do.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.640
And so like a rich kid is no longer like in charge of the school, right?

28:24.640 --> 28:27.120
The rich kid is now this like,

28:27.120 --> 28:31.440
oh, you must need all of your parents' money because of-

28:32.240 --> 28:33.280
You're a fart lover.

28:33.280 --> 28:33.680
Yeah.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.280
This has been, this got weird.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.480
Can we do another question?

28:36.480 --> 28:38.320
Man, I'm still trying to get myself together.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.560
I really, for a 35 year old,

28:40.560 --> 28:42.960
like I do think farts are very funny.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.440
Oh yeah.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.000
Like I've been doing this show for a while.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.920
You'd think I'd be a nerd too, but man, oh man.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.360
A good friend of mine has a deathly fear of alligators.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.600
She is petrified by the very thought of them.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.000
She even sees a picture of one, she freaks out.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.600
Now this might be a legitimate fear,

28:59.600 --> 29:01.120
except for one tiny detail.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.560
She lives in Colorado.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.120
Alex, that's gator country.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.680
There was a night when she heard a noise

29:07.680 --> 29:10.560
on her second story balcony and was too petrified to move

29:10.560 --> 29:12.720
because she was convinced that a gator

29:13.280 --> 29:14.960
had climbed into her balcony.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.760
It was flipping around out there and trying to get in.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.480
Jesus.

29:18.480 --> 29:22.560
How can I get her over this ridiculous phobia?

29:22.560 --> 29:25.520
That's from Captain Hook's best friend in the Rockies.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.800
And they call me, I'm the world's greatest cat burglar.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.680
And they call me the gator because of my ability

29:31.680 --> 29:35.120
to scale walls and flip around until I open a door.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.960
I feel like they're terrifying.

29:36.960 --> 29:37.760
Yeah, they're not good.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.840
I sleep on the second story of my house.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.800
If I look out the window and see a gator like flapping

29:42.800 --> 29:44.000
his stupid tail against the window,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.080
I'm gonna let that bad boy in because he earned it.

29:46.080 --> 29:46.560
Come get what you need.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.520
What's his story?

29:47.520 --> 29:49.200
What's your story to tell you?

29:49.200 --> 29:50.560
Come take what you need, stud.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.640
You've earned it getting all the way up here.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.000
You scrappy little lizard.

29:54.000 --> 29:54.480
Come on.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.040
Come on, bud.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.000
Come on in.

29:56.000 --> 29:56.480
Come on in.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.760
Come get what you need.

29:57.760 --> 30:06.320
I was totally immune to both the terror projection ability

30:06.320 --> 30:11.120
of alligators and also the seductive potential

30:11.120 --> 30:11.920
of alligators.

30:13.840 --> 30:17.360
They were a non-threat in my mind until I learned

30:17.360 --> 30:20.560
that those motherfuckers can run at like 40 miles an hour.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.600
And that's crazy.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.160
They can run as fast as a moped.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.280
And that's crazy.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.280
And then that's when I kind of got it.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.240
Because if you've seen the gator, that's too late.

30:33.520 --> 30:36.400
Okay, I've never seen that happen ever.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.360
And that sounds like some bullshit that alligators started.

30:40.800 --> 30:41.760
Don't even fuck with us.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.600
We can run real, real fast.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.520
Yo, Lab Coat, get over here.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.240
Guess what?

30:46.240 --> 30:47.840
I can run 40 miles an hour.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.800
Put that in a book.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.560
Write it down.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.520
Write it down.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.440
If it's in the book, I don't have to do it.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.200
Also, I'm bulletproof.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.560
Yeah, bulletproof.

30:56.560 --> 31:00.880
It says here in this reptile book that alligators can run 40 miles an hour.

31:00.880 --> 31:05.280
And that the boy gators have just big, great ding-dongs.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.080
And they love to...

31:06.720 --> 31:11.840
It says here boy gators have had sex with just like so many lady gators.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.040
Like it's insane.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.040
And then all the lady gators like loved it.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.160
And that boy gators have a bunch of money.

31:18.160 --> 31:18.960
This is crazy.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.880
This book is just a crazy book.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.800
It says this in the book that if you feed an alligator a raw steak,

31:24.800 --> 31:27.600
he'll spit out a Ferrero Rocher and grant you a wish.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.640
That's crazy.

31:28.640 --> 31:29.200
That's crazy.

31:29.200 --> 31:33.920
Who would have ever thought that like would be the way that gators work in Tesla?

31:33.920 --> 31:37.920
It says here if gators, if you're a kid and you just jump in a gator's mouth,

31:38.640 --> 31:41.120
then there's a Game Boy in there.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.000
There's a Game Boy in that gator's mouth.

31:44.000 --> 31:44.400
That's crazy.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.880
There's a Game Boy in there and it's got Pokemon in it.

31:46.880 --> 31:50.480
And then the cartridge has all the Pokemon pre-caught and they're all level 99.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.360
That's crazy.

31:51.360 --> 31:57.200
And inside of every gator, there's just a fucking binder

31:57.200 --> 32:00.720
and it has all of the Pokemon cards in it all the way up to Gen 6.

32:00.720 --> 32:01.760
That's fucking nuts.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.800
Anyway, get in there.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.080
It also says it's risk-free.

32:04.080 --> 32:04.800
Get in there, kids.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.840
Get in there, young Griffin.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.320
Get in there.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.680
And that's how Griffin died.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.040
And that's how Griffin died.

32:11.040 --> 32:16.000
I think the problem here is that your friend is afraid of the idea of alligators.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.760
Which is horrifying.

32:17.760 --> 32:22.480
And you need to do a little immersion therapy.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.720
You need to take her to a gator farm.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.520
I'm not saying throw her in a pit with some gators.

32:27.520 --> 32:31.920
I'm saying you need to take her to one of those gator shows

32:31.920 --> 32:33.760
where a burly person wrestles a gator.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.440
Has sex with an alligator.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.160
No.

32:36.160 --> 32:36.880
Oh, sorry.

32:36.880 --> 32:37.120
No.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.080
Where they wrestle the alligator and you say,

32:40.960 --> 32:45.440
see that person just totally dominated that alligator.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.360
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.320
It's like when I saw when I was like six

32:50.320 --> 32:52.640
and I saw Resident Evil being played by you guys

32:52.640 --> 32:54.720
and I was afraid of zombies for like two years

32:54.720 --> 32:59.040
until I watched a man have sex with a zombie, I guess.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.680
And then it was like, all right, we can beat this thing together.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I think dressing up like a gator is good.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.040
Like, and just refusing until she gets over it.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.520
Because then it's like, oh my, it gets confusing.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.680
Like, I'm afraid of alligators but my best friend's an alligator.

33:17.680 --> 33:19.280
I don't really, maybe I'm not as afraid of them

33:19.280 --> 33:19.920
as I thought I was.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.240
Maybe a baby gator.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.200
They're really cute.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.320
They're not bad.

33:24.320 --> 33:24.640
Yeah.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.880
Get them an egg with a gator in it

33:26.880 --> 33:28.720
and have them raise it from birth.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.480
Yeah, say there's a bird in there, I bet.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.000
You follow them up with this egg.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.280
There's a bird in there, I think.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.920
And then when it hatches, you're like, listen, I understand.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.640
Trust me, this is the scariest part of what's happening.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.040
The reveal, like, wait for the prestige.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.640
Tomorrow's gonna be good.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.760
Today's gonna be bad.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.520
The hatching day will be bad.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.240
The hatching will be bad.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.760
I swear to God, Susan, I thought there was a bird in there.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.880
I thought I was just giving you an advice.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.960
The egg guy told me it was a bird egg.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.920
I don't know what to tell you, but we have to keep it legally.

34:00.560 --> 34:04.560
A special alligator killing eagle is what he said to me.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.760
Maybe it turns into that.

34:05.760 --> 34:08.160
Maybe it will evolve into a bird.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.040
I'm out $17.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.360
How do you think I feel?

34:13.360 --> 34:15.600
That was solid fart money I could have spent.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.320
I had 17 farts down the drain.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.600
Or back up the drain, I guess.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.440
Speaking of fart money, let's get the money set.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.720
I want to tell you about Trunk Club.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.160
Yes.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.680
And you can't stop me.

34:39.680 --> 34:43.840
So everybody today, across the board, no matter what age,

34:43.840 --> 34:47.280
whether you're nine months old or 99 months old,

34:48.080 --> 34:49.520
you don't know how to dress yourself.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.560
Yeah, really old.

34:50.560 --> 34:51.760
You don't know how to dress yourself.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.120
You're a mess.

34:53.120 --> 34:53.840
Look at yourself.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.360
What a good news.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.600
There's Trunk Club, and Trunk Club has lots of people

34:57.600 --> 34:59.200
who can tell you how to dress yourself

34:59.200 --> 35:01.680
and help you find really, really cool clothes

35:01.680 --> 35:02.960
that will fill.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.720
I found a pair of jeans at Trunk Club

35:04.720 --> 35:08.240
that was the jeans I've dreamed about my entire life.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.240
And I didn't know that jeans like this existed

35:10.240 --> 35:11.840
until Trunk Club helped me find them.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.280
You found your dream jeans.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.080
My dream jeans.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.280
They've got personal stylists that will talk to you,

35:17.280 --> 35:19.360
walk you through stuff, and work together with you

35:19.360 --> 35:20.960
to find the looks that you're looking for.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.240
And how it works is they send you the stuff

35:24.960 --> 35:27.120
and then you keep what you like

35:27.120 --> 35:28.960
and you send back what you don't

35:28.960 --> 35:30.240
and you pay for what you keep.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.880
So you don't end up with a bunch of shit

35:32.880 --> 35:34.640
that you don't like and you're stuck with it

35:34.640 --> 35:35.920
and you've already paid for it.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.440
You actually get to try it on,

35:37.440 --> 35:38.880
show it to your friends and family

35:38.880 --> 35:40.560
and say like, what do you think?

35:40.560 --> 35:41.520
Okay, great.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.480
And then you keep it.

35:42.480 --> 35:43.520
So if you wanna check it out,

35:43.520 --> 35:46.720
you can go to trunkclub.com slash my brother

35:48.320 --> 35:51.120
and check it out and maybe work with a stylist.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.000
Check out some shit.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.440
See, I'm telling you, I got an outfit from Trunk Club

35:57.440 --> 36:00.800
that is my new like, I'm going out to a concert.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.200
It's your new Doug Funny uniform.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.080
It's my new Doug Funny.

36:04.080 --> 36:09.440
It's my on and off court buddies.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.520
I wanna tell you guys about Dunk Club.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.200
Now this is a new club I've started.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.200
And basically what it is, is you pay me directly.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.120
That's the best part of the service.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.320
No middleman, just me.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.440
And you pay me directly

36:21.440 --> 36:23.760
and I'll come to your house every day,

36:24.960 --> 36:27.920
every single day, whether you want me to or not.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.480
And I'll just show you one of my dunks.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.240
And it's not really an educational thing.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.320
Like I'm not there teaching you new and exciting

36:34.320 --> 36:35.680
and explosive dunks.

36:36.560 --> 36:39.280
It's just like, you just get to watch me do one.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.360
And it's just one dunk a day.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.680
Please don't ask me to repeat the dunk

36:43.680 --> 36:44.800
because I absolutely won't do it.

36:44.800 --> 36:45.840
And you're just gonna make it uncomfortable.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.040
And you know I'm gonna be there tomorrow.

36:47.040 --> 36:51.120
So like, it's important that we maintain like a sort of balance

36:51.760 --> 36:53.360
in our professional relationship.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.280
But yeah, just come to your house and do one dunk every day.

36:56.160 --> 36:56.800
Oh.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.120
I really only know how to do the one dunk.

36:59.120 --> 37:01.280
And it's just, I have two hands over my head

37:01.280 --> 37:02.480
and I jump as high as I can.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.080
And let's see what happens.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.680
But you do it over and over and over.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.640
Yeah, every day.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.000
Can I tell you about-

37:08.000 --> 37:11.280
So go check out trunkclub.com slash my brother.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.840
I want to tell you guys about Blue Apron.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.360
Now this isn't, now it has the same name

37:17.360 --> 37:18.240
as the other Blue Apron.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.520
But this is another club I've started

37:19.520 --> 37:21.200
where I'll come to your house every day and do a dunk.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.520
In an apron?

37:23.520 --> 37:24.480
In a Blue Apron.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.640
Yeah, it's kind of like a comedy thing.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.640
No, Blue Apron is-

37:28.640 --> 37:30.240
And you just see how dinner is served

37:30.240 --> 37:31.600
as you slam the dunk.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.320
Right, as I slammed the dunk right into the dunk hole.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.440
No, Blue Apron is amazing.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.440
All of us, I'm pretty sure use it.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.320
We all use it, right?

37:40.320 --> 37:41.040
I use it.

37:41.040 --> 37:41.600
Okay, yeah.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.320
Big fan.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.280
It's fucking incredible.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.760
Ate it yesterday, gonna eat it today.

37:46.480 --> 37:47.760
They send you ingredients that you need

37:47.760 --> 37:49.120
to cook incredible meals.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.040
With the highest quality standards

37:51.040 --> 37:53.360
for their community of artisanal suppliers,

37:53.360 --> 37:55.920
family-run farms, fisheries, and ranchers.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.000
We talk a lot about how you get the recipes

37:58.000 --> 38:00.320
and then you make the good meals.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.160
Stuff like Japanese ramen noodles

38:02.160 --> 38:04.160
and I had a salmon salad yesterday

38:04.160 --> 38:05.440
that was like really, really good.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.320
The meals available in May include stuff

38:08.320 --> 38:10.960
like crispy cod and cabbage slaw tacos

38:10.960 --> 38:14.240
with pepita, pineapple, and avocado salsa.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.080
I know, I got some General Tso's chicken upstairs.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.440
General Tso's chicken, yeah.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.040
Yeah, I'm excited about that one.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.200
Middle Eastern chicken and chickpea stew

38:21.200 --> 38:22.560
with pita croutons.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.840
That sounds good.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.320
Got some pita or some pan-seared pork chops

38:26.320 --> 38:28.960
with two cheese mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.080
Like the meals are very, very good

38:30.080 --> 38:31.520
but like what's also really cool

38:31.520 --> 38:33.040
is that the meals usually share

38:33.040 --> 38:36.240
like a common ingredient that's like farm to table

38:36.240 --> 38:37.840
and like really fresh in season

38:37.840 --> 38:38.560
and really, really good.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.040
So anyway, you can check out this week's menu

38:41.040 --> 38:44.240
and get your first two meals free with free shipping

38:44.240 --> 38:46.480
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.240
It's blueapron.com slash my brother.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.000
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.360
Seriously, we all use it.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.080
It's changed my life.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.440
We love it a lot, go check it out.

38:53.440 --> 38:55.200
I did not cook before we started doing it

38:55.200 --> 38:57.600
and now I cook a few times a week and it's amazing.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.880
I've got a Jumbotron message to Ashley

39:02.880 --> 39:03.840
from her husband, Ben.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.280
It says, happy fifth anniversary.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.760
I can't think of a better way to say I love you

39:07.760 --> 39:09.840
than for the brothers to say it for me.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.560
Can we all say it?

39:10.560 --> 39:12.080
Can we all just say it in unison right now?

39:12.080 --> 39:14.320
Okay, one, two, three.

39:14.880 --> 39:15.440
I love you.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.000
I love you.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.560
However, don't worry by the time this airs

39:18.560 --> 39:20.560
I'll hopefully have thought of something else as well.

39:20.560 --> 39:21.120
Probably?

39:21.920 --> 39:24.320
Anyway, here's to another five years together.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.760
You better not, cause we just said it.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.680
So if you say it now, it's gonna be weird.

39:27.680 --> 39:28.800
It's a bit copycat.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.400
What if you say something better?

39:30.400 --> 39:32.240
What if you're the one who finally discovers

39:32.800 --> 39:34.640
something better to say than I love you?

39:35.440 --> 39:37.760
Like discovers like the next strata.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.200
You know what I'm talking about?

39:39.200 --> 39:40.720
Yeah, like what's beyond that?

39:41.280 --> 39:44.000
Like what's the umami of I love you?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.080
What's the umami, the fifth love flavor?

39:47.440 --> 39:48.880
What is the fifth love flavor?

39:50.640 --> 39:52.320
You're joining us here at Kitchen Stadium.

39:52.320 --> 39:55.200
Um, the chef has just used the fifth love flavor.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.920
I have another message I want to do real quick.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.360
It is from Mark Petrocious.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.240
Now people say, how do you remember these names?

40:02.240 --> 40:04.000
And this one I have a mnemonic device for.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.840
It's supercalifragilistic.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.120
Hey, it's Mark Petrocious.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.160
That's how I help.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.200
Always remember it.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.640
And this message is from Drew.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.120
And it says, hey chuckle fuck.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.960
I figured out what better way to spend the money

40:14.960 --> 40:17.200
that you bet me thinking the star wars seven

40:17.200 --> 40:19.040
would be worse than episode one.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.320
Then to have your three favorite brothers let you know

40:22.320 --> 40:23.520
how dumb you are.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.400
Here you go.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.240
Your hard-earned money being used to tell you

40:26.240 --> 40:27.840
how bad you fucked up.

40:27.840 --> 40:28.640
Enjoy.

40:28.640 --> 40:29.760
Yeah, that was a bad bet.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.200
And an expensive bet.

40:31.200 --> 40:31.920
Who does that?

40:31.920 --> 40:35.920
I bet you $150 that this star wars movie is gonna suck.

40:35.920 --> 40:36.240
What?

40:36.880 --> 40:37.360
What?

40:37.360 --> 40:38.480
Guys, that's a bad bet.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.680
It looked amazing in the preview.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.520
Yeah, the trailers were like really.

40:41.520 --> 40:41.840
Yeah.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.720
Nobody knows when Petrocious did this.

40:45.520 --> 40:48.000
Like nobody knows when he made this bet.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.840
Yeah, like maybe he just.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.920
The records have been lost to time.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.760
Did you, maybe it was early.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.720
Like when somebody was like, hey, did you hear the alias guy

40:56.720 --> 40:59.760
is making his own star wars movie by himself?

40:59.760 --> 41:01.280
And he's playing all the parts.

41:01.280 --> 41:01.520
Yeah.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.920
Like that would have been an opportunity.

41:03.920 --> 41:04.720
Maybe at that point.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.480
There's no lightsabers in this one.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.280
Isn't that weird?

41:07.280 --> 41:07.920
Or space.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.560
Apparently it's all happening under the sea.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.760
It's an underwater gungan fuck fest.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.320
Got one more message here.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.120
Okay.

41:17.120 --> 41:21.200
This one is for Ryan and it's from Thomas who says,

41:21.200 --> 41:23.840
hey Ryan, even though you're an upper manager now and have all

41:23.840 --> 41:25.360
these super important responsibilities,

41:25.360 --> 41:27.200
I hope you have a few minutes to hear the McElroy brothers

41:27.200 --> 41:29.200
deliver a message from a lowly peon.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.200
I'm so proud to have you as my brother.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.760
The work you do at patch gaming helps people struggling with

41:33.760 --> 41:36.320
anxiety and depression is incredibly important.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.240
And you're such a great lead events coordinator.

41:38.240 --> 41:41.440
However, I would appreciate it if you'd stop being so damn good

41:41.440 --> 41:42.880
at Kerbal space program.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.400
You make the rest of us look bad.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.840
I know we both have a lot on our plates,

41:45.840 --> 41:48.320
but I'm glad we found the McElroy family of shows together.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.000
Even if my white whale is getting you

41:50.000 --> 41:51.200
to listen to the adventure zone.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.720
You sure it's a pretty good show.

41:55.040 --> 41:58.160
Thanks for being there when I need to talk a great co-op buddy

41:58.160 --> 41:59.840
and my partner in geekery.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.600
I love you, Thomas.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.880
That was very sweet.

42:02.880 --> 42:03.600
That's sweet.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.880
I don't like him that earnest though.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.040
I like, like, don't you want to make fun of him for something?

42:07.920 --> 42:08.560
There's gotta be something.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.320
He's too nice.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.280
You're too good at putting together spaceships that-

42:13.280 --> 42:15.680
You're too good at leading events.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.120
You co-ordinator.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.640
You cool coordinator.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.600
I just looked at the first three words I saw on the page.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.760
That was not a good insult.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.560
You stinking co-ordinator.

42:28.560 --> 42:31.360
Ty is a pedantic person.

42:31.360 --> 42:35.680
I think when he pronounces these words, it's in a very show-offy way.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.120
Jairo.

42:37.120 --> 42:38.000
Yiro.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.040
Sacrebleu.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.000
Sacrebleu.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.040
Ayers Rock.

42:41.040 --> 42:41.680
Uluru.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.080
What you are witnessing is real.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.320
The participants are not actors.

42:46.320 --> 42:49.360
They are actual litigants with real cases.

42:49.360 --> 42:55.200
They call in via Skype to Judge John Hodgman's court, the real people's court.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.800
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

42:58.800 --> 43:02.960
Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.080
How about a yahoo?

43:06.080 --> 43:08.960
How about a cool fresh yahoo?

43:08.960 --> 43:11.840
How about a cool fresh yahoo?

43:11.840 --> 43:13.840
A seasonal, farm-to-market yahoo.

43:16.160 --> 43:19.200
This one was sent in by level9000yajurajudevenport.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.000
Thank you, Drew.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.480
It's by Yajuranser's user, Abby, who asks,

43:24.480 --> 43:25.440
Out of cheese?

43:27.440 --> 43:29.680
The local Mexican food place was out of cheese,

43:29.680 --> 43:32.720
and I want to write a letter of complaint instead of being rude.

43:32.720 --> 43:35.360
Any ideas of some gentle yet firm things I can say?

43:35.360 --> 43:37.360
A couple of things.

43:37.360 --> 43:40.800
If I worked at this Mexican restaurant and we ran out of cheese one day,

43:40.800 --> 43:43.360
like I know we fucked up, there's going to be three things.

43:43.360 --> 43:44.080
I know I said a couple.

43:44.080 --> 43:44.720
That's the first thing.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.880
The second thing is if somebody walks up to me and says,

43:46.880 --> 43:48.080
hey, you fucked up, idiot.

43:48.080 --> 43:49.120
There's no cheese, dummy.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.720
How am I supposed to enjoy my meals?

43:51.360 --> 43:55.360
I would be upset at that person, but I would be way more upset

43:55.360 --> 43:57.760
if I received a letter in the mail telling me that I have

43:57.760 --> 43:59.120
fucked up with the cheese problem.

43:59.120 --> 44:01.600
To whom it may concern.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.840
Because the insult, somebody wrote something like,

44:03.840 --> 44:06.320
somebody rolls up and gets right up in your grill and is like,

44:06.320 --> 44:08.720
where's the fucking cheese, please?

44:08.720 --> 44:11.840
Then I would be like, ugh, I hate this interaction,

44:11.840 --> 44:13.200
but it'll be over soon.

44:13.200 --> 44:17.040
If I received some sort of physical, tangible artifact in the mail

44:17.600 --> 44:20.240
informing me of a cheese problem that somebody had,

44:20.240 --> 44:22.960
I would be sadder that that person exists.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.120
Then I would be at the person who comes and yells at my face.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.640
I just picture Griffin in that circumstance,

44:26.640 --> 44:29.440
sitting down at his desk, and he's both looking at the letter

44:29.440 --> 44:32.400
and also the cheese order for me forgot to send.

44:32.400 --> 44:35.040
And he's just looking back and forth between the two of them

44:35.040 --> 44:36.320
and sobbing uncontrollably.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.880
Just sobbing, ugh, I really fucked up.

44:38.880 --> 44:41.120
I fucked up the whole cheese situation.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.640
The whole cheese thing.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.680
I did cheese bad from start to finish.

44:47.680 --> 44:50.480
The third thing is just fuck you, man, come on.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.840
You don't think they, come on, they know.

44:53.840 --> 44:57.280
They weren't expecting such a run on cheese, you know?

44:57.280 --> 45:00.160
They thought they had enough cheese for the lunch rush,

45:00.160 --> 45:04.000
and then they had like eight people all come in at the same time

45:04.000 --> 45:06.560
and just ask for a big bowl of cheese.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.080
They weren't expecting it.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.200
It wasn't their fault.

45:09.920 --> 45:12.240
You know, sometimes you just run out of cheese.

45:12.240 --> 45:13.680
That's what being an adult is.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.400
Sometimes being an adult is accepting that there's not always cheese

45:16.400 --> 45:18.160
when you want it, and you have to make do.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.120
Maybe you get sour cream or you get extra avocado, whatever.

45:21.120 --> 45:23.840
But you have to accept that there's not always cheese when you want it.

45:23.840 --> 45:25.280
The world's not perfect.

45:25.280 --> 45:27.440
Did you even stop to see if they had milk?

45:27.440 --> 45:28.640
Because if they have milk,

45:28.640 --> 45:31.920
because if they have milk and thyme, you got cheese, my friend.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.800
Dog, if they got milk and salt and a hairdryer,

45:34.800 --> 45:36.080
you got cheese there, dude.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.200
Did you offer to go get more cheese for them?

45:39.200 --> 45:42.000
Like, I'll go on a cheese run, just kick me like a 20,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.920
and I'll bring you guys back some cheese

45:43.920 --> 45:46.720
because we're all in this fucking thing together.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.560
This big dumb world is still spinning,

45:48.560 --> 45:50.400
all of us are just hanging on for dear life.

45:50.400 --> 45:53.680
I'll go get you some CHWSE, my boy.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.120
And what you didn't pay attention to

45:55.120 --> 45:58.240
is maybe they're cheese ordering guys having a really tough time.

45:58.240 --> 46:00.720
Maybe like he and his wife got in a fight before he came to work

46:00.720 --> 46:02.320
and forgot to pick up cheese on the way.

46:02.320 --> 46:05.360
But here's you in your little cheese-centric world,

46:05.360 --> 46:07.280
not even worried about his feelings.

46:07.280 --> 46:10.000
Maybe it was weird cheese that looked more like butter

46:10.000 --> 46:11.520
and you just thought it was butter though.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.920
Yeah, we all made that mistake at fancy restaurants.

46:13.920 --> 46:16.960
Maybe he had cheese, but he thought it wasn't good enough for you

46:16.960 --> 46:18.320
and he wanted to protect you.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.960
Can I also ask fancy restaurants super quick,

46:21.600 --> 46:24.960
please stop bringing scoops of white to the table

46:24.960 --> 46:28.160
and expecting me to know if they have cheese or butter.

46:28.160 --> 46:33.200
Or cream or ice, very small ice cream or mothballs

46:33.200 --> 46:35.200
because you made a very big mistake.

46:35.200 --> 46:39.200
Yeah, or just like some sort of fun ball like a toy, like a game.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.280
Like it's going to be a while before we can get our food out to you.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.040
So play with this small white ball.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.080
Like a Cracker Barrel?

46:44.880 --> 46:45.120
Yeah.

46:47.280 --> 46:49.440
I want to read this response from Mary's Mama who says,

46:49.440 --> 46:52.080
we have many fast food places near us where we live.

46:52.080 --> 46:52.880
During the lunchtime rush,

46:52.880 --> 46:55.280
it's not uncommon for soap and toilet paper to run out in the breastrooms.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.360
Food items to be made wrong by poorly trained new employees

46:57.360 --> 46:58.800
and other mistakes of all kinds happening,

46:58.800 --> 47:00.880
including ingredients not being available.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.560
If this is a first time occurrence,

47:02.560 --> 47:05.680
tell them, let them apologize and then let it go.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.920
There's a proverb, once is happenstance,

47:07.920 --> 47:11.360
twice is coincidence and three times may be enemy action.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.880
So adjust your attitude,

47:12.880 --> 47:14.560
give them one more chance to do things right

47:14.560 --> 47:17.040
and if they screw up after that, don't go there anymore.

47:17.680 --> 47:20.080
Hold on, is this person saying that the third time

47:20.080 --> 47:22.080
this fast food restaurant hates you?

47:22.080 --> 47:23.520
Yo, fuck you, Derek.

47:23.520 --> 47:27.120
No cheese, no cheese for you, no cheese for you, Seinfeld.

47:27.120 --> 47:31.040
Joe, if this is a first time occurrence,

47:31.040 --> 47:32.880
tell them and let them apologize.

47:32.880 --> 47:37.520
Hey, you ran out of, you should have cheese.

47:38.240 --> 47:40.000
Oh yeah, we're sorry.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.600
But you don't have cheese.

47:41.600 --> 47:42.320
Did you know this?

47:43.920 --> 47:45.360
But they say let them apologize.

47:45.360 --> 47:49.600
I was like, listen, I wanted to say to you,

47:49.600 --> 47:50.720
you ran out of cheese.

47:50.720 --> 47:54.320
Now, do you have anything you would like to say to me?

47:54.320 --> 47:57.200
How do you possibly sound sincere apologizing

47:57.200 --> 47:58.720
for running out of cheese?

47:58.720 --> 47:59.920
Yeah, I don't know.

48:00.800 --> 48:01.920
Thank you for your time.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.680
I will take my answer off the air.

48:04.960 --> 48:07.440
And then you close your eyes and just wait.

48:08.160 --> 48:12.080
When I worked in food service at the country's best yogurt,

48:12.080 --> 48:14.240
we ran out of a yogurt flavor

48:15.440 --> 48:17.760
and if somebody had come up to me and been like,

48:17.760 --> 48:20.080
you'd no longer have cinnamon swirl.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.480
I would say, I know this.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.320
Like, why do you know?

48:24.320 --> 48:26.400
Like if somebody walked up to me and was like,

48:26.400 --> 48:27.840
you're really, really high

48:27.840 --> 48:30.160
and you're just touching the cones with your bare hands

48:30.160 --> 48:31.920
because you forgot to put gloves on.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.280
Yeah, I know.

48:35.120 --> 48:35.840
I know this.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.640
I also get a kick out of like,

48:38.640 --> 48:41.120
as somebody who has worked in many, many retail jobs

48:41.120 --> 48:44.000
and a few food service jobs,

48:44.640 --> 48:47.120
I get a kick out of like people who don't realize

48:47.120 --> 48:51.200
exactly how low on the supply chain

48:51.200 --> 48:53.520
you actually are.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.920
If you were like talking to somebody at a restaurant,

48:55.920 --> 48:59.280
like the idea that they could have in any way

48:59.280 --> 49:03.120
predicted or circumvented the issue of the cheese

49:03.120 --> 49:04.400
is baffling to me.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.960
Like they don't know how the cheese gets there.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.520
They don't know where the cheese comes from before then.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.880
They know there's a place they open up

49:10.880 --> 49:12.240
and sometimes there's cheese

49:12.240 --> 49:14.160
and sometimes there aren't cheese.

49:14.160 --> 49:17.040
Like that's as high up on the chain as they go.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.480
When I worked at Best Buy,

49:18.480 --> 49:20.400
there were numerous times where a truck would come in

49:20.400 --> 49:22.400
and be like, well, we didn't get any wheeze,

49:22.400 --> 49:23.840
which we're still sold out of,

49:23.840 --> 49:26.400
but for some reason we got like 20 Furbys.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.760
So that's great.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.440
And then we'll just add that to the pile.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.760
Yeah, you have no idea.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.200
You're one step up from the customer.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.680
Listen, if you want to come back here behind the counter

49:35.680 --> 49:37.280
and look for cheese, you're more than welcome to.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.320
Because that's all I'd do.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.240
So what you do is if someone complains about the cheese,

49:40.240 --> 49:41.520
you go, come with me.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.680
And then you find the next person up on the chain

49:43.680 --> 49:45.760
and you're like, did you know we were out of cheese?

49:45.760 --> 49:47.360
And then you just keep moving up the chain

49:47.360 --> 49:49.200
until you find the cheese magnate

49:49.200 --> 49:50.720
who's just sitting on a pile of cheese,

49:50.720 --> 49:51.600
not letting it out.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.840
Like the beers, they're just building up,

49:53.840 --> 49:56.240
you know, supply and demand on their cheese.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.280
And you yell at them really hard.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.160
I'm glad we all agree that you have to yell at somebody.

50:02.160 --> 50:02.660
Yeah.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.160
You can't just accept that there's no cheese.

50:06.880 --> 50:07.840
Oh, for sure.

50:07.840 --> 50:10.560
No, this is, well, I don't know where this question came from,

50:10.560 --> 50:12.160
but I'm in America.

50:12.160 --> 50:12.660
Yeah.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.800
Cheese is my right.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.880
I ride my bike to and from work every day,

50:16.880 --> 50:19.280
although listen to the brothers McElroy, that's us.

50:20.080 --> 50:20.580
Hopefully.

50:21.920 --> 50:22.400
Yeah.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.800
We haven't, oh God, TM, TM, TM.

50:24.800 --> 50:25.760
TM, TM, TM, the whole-

50:25.760 --> 50:27.360
Why have we sat on this so long?

50:27.360 --> 50:29.200
For six years, TM on six years.

50:30.480 --> 50:33.120
The time, it cannot protect me from my greatest enemy.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.280
This passes the time,

50:35.280 --> 50:37.120
it cannot protect me from my greatest enemy.

50:37.120 --> 50:39.360
On my way to work, I ride by a small pond

50:39.360 --> 50:41.680
that is home to a particularly rude-

50:41.680 --> 50:43.120
A perfectly rude family.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.280
Perfectly rude family of geese.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.840
They recently just had babies,

50:47.840 --> 50:49.920
and although I respect their life choices,

50:49.920 --> 50:52.560
the parents have become very defensive.

50:52.560 --> 50:55.040
One goose has taken a flying after me as I ride away

50:55.040 --> 50:56.000
as fast as I can.

50:56.560 --> 50:58.480
I'm afraid they're going to bite my legs off,

50:58.480 --> 50:59.520
and I need your help.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.880
How can I learn to coexist with my feathered friends?

51:03.520 --> 51:06.800
That's from wishing I could fly away home in Wisconsin.

51:07.840 --> 51:12.960
We have had a, let's call it tumultuous,

51:12.960 --> 51:16.480
confusing relationship with geesees

51:17.040 --> 51:19.200
in the past, in the history of this show.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.560
I feel like we've oscillated between,

51:21.200 --> 51:24.080
they are modern day velociraptors,

51:24.640 --> 51:26.000
would love to fuck one of them guys,

51:27.120 --> 51:28.720
and then back to the velociraptor thing,

51:28.720 --> 51:30.160
and I feel like that's where we're at now,

51:30.160 --> 51:34.000
and I think maybe it's 2016, 2016, building bridges.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.360
I feel like maybe we need to build a bridge

51:35.360 --> 51:36.480
to the goose community,

51:36.480 --> 51:39.840
and let's just really role play it, just real quick.

51:39.840 --> 51:44.880
A goose-based advice podcast for geese by geese.

51:44.880 --> 51:47.520
We are geese doing a goose-based podcast.

51:47.520 --> 51:48.960
I feel like this is going to help enlighten it.

51:48.960 --> 51:50.880
And this question, hi everybody, I'm Griffin McElroy,

51:50.880 --> 51:52.960
I'm a goose, and you're a goose when you're listening to this.

51:52.960 --> 51:55.280
This question comes from a goose from Wisconsin,

51:55.280 --> 51:58.720
and it says, shitty kids come up and kick me all the time,

51:58.720 --> 52:00.560
and they kick my kids for no reason

52:00.560 --> 52:02.880
because human beings are the worst,

52:02.880 --> 52:05.760
and they don't even think about goose feelings

52:05.760 --> 52:07.360
when they just kick the shit out of us,

52:07.360 --> 52:08.400
so what should I do?

52:08.400 --> 52:10.080
Well, thanks for sitting in Wisconsin,

52:10.080 --> 52:11.040
thanks for this question.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.080
You need to be very defensive,

52:12.080 --> 52:13.680
and you need to just attack first,

52:13.680 --> 52:15.520
because we're just geese out here just trying to get along,

52:15.520 --> 52:16.320
and we're just trying to survive,

52:16.320 --> 52:17.920
so just bite, bite, bite, quack, quack, quack,

52:17.920 --> 52:19.760
get out there, fly at them, attack them.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.520
Yeah, because you think about it,

52:21.520 --> 52:25.440
like if you got attacked by one goose,

52:25.440 --> 52:27.760
like every time this goose fucked you up,

52:27.760 --> 52:29.120
it's the same goose every time,

52:29.120 --> 52:31.440
the next time you ran into a goose,

52:31.440 --> 52:32.800
you wouldn't differentiate.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.560
If someone's like, I'm going to go pet that motherfucker,

52:34.560 --> 52:35.360
you'd be like, don't.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.160
Don't do that, actually.

52:36.160 --> 52:38.000
Geese is, don't do that.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.880
No, they bite, they bite your legs off.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.720
Let me just, here's what you need.

52:42.720 --> 52:44.000
You need to build a bridge here.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.600
I think Gervin's absolutely right.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.040
Yeah, build a bridge over their nest,

52:47.040 --> 52:49.120
so that way you don't have to interact with that water.

52:49.120 --> 52:52.640
I think that, okay, if this were a movie, right,

52:52.640 --> 52:55.360
and this was like, there's a damaged animal,

52:55.360 --> 52:57.840
you know, cagey, defensive animal,

52:57.840 --> 53:00.000
and you're going to do like a little horse whisper thing,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.880
do a little goose whispering, you're going to like.

53:02.880 --> 53:06.640
Without a sexual agenda appended to it.

53:06.640 --> 53:07.920
No, because they'll know.

53:07.920 --> 53:11.760
Like, when you get close, maybe like, park your bike,

53:11.760 --> 53:13.040
and like, you're just going to sit.

53:13.680 --> 53:17.120
But within like, visual range of the goose,

53:17.120 --> 53:19.760
but not close enough that they feel threatened.

53:19.760 --> 53:22.320
And then the next day, you're going to do it a little closer.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.880
And then the next day, now this might take years.

53:24.880 --> 53:25.440
Yeah.

53:25.440 --> 53:28.400
But eventually, you'll be right next to them.

53:28.400 --> 53:28.800
Are you going to feed the geese?

53:28.800 --> 53:31.680
And you'll be like Jane Goodall, all up in that shit.

53:31.680 --> 53:34.640
You'll be Jane Goosall, you'll be right there.

53:34.640 --> 53:35.760
Are you going to try and feed these?

53:35.760 --> 53:37.280
Are you going to try and feed these sweet feathered beasts?

53:37.280 --> 53:39.680
No, you're going to join their herd?

53:39.680 --> 53:41.520
I see, no bribery then.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.040
Unless.

53:43.040 --> 53:43.680
Unless.

53:43.680 --> 53:47.360
Unless what you are proposing right there

53:47.920 --> 53:51.600
is teaching them to trust humans.

53:51.600 --> 53:53.440
Which you don't want to do.

53:53.440 --> 53:54.880
I cannot stress this enough.

53:54.880 --> 53:55.520
You don't want to do.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.480
Let me amend it then.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.960
Let me propose an alternate plan.

53:58.960 --> 53:59.200
Okay.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.760
Every day, you roll up to the geese,

54:02.560 --> 54:06.000
and you toss them a bo staff, and you're like, how about thee?

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
And every day, you fight the geese.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.240
And that teaches them to, one, be defensive of humans,

54:10.240 --> 54:12.160
but it also teaches them our weaknesses.

54:12.160 --> 54:15.120
So I'm saying every day, you attack the geese full blast

54:15.120 --> 54:16.080
for like 30 seconds.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.280
Do you think there'll come a time

54:17.280 --> 54:20.080
where they respect you as a combatant?

54:20.080 --> 54:22.880
At first, you're going to kick their asses.

54:22.880 --> 54:25.280
But if you do it enough days, they live,

54:25.840 --> 54:26.640
you're going to-

54:26.640 --> 54:29.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, because there's a caveat in there

54:29.760 --> 54:32.080
that much like Eurovision at the beginning of the podcast,

54:32.080 --> 54:33.520
you kind of tried to gloss right over.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.760
Well, it's not the most important thing.

54:35.760 --> 54:36.560
The most important thing is that

54:36.560 --> 54:38.160
they're going to start to learn your weaknesses.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.240
They're going to start to learn your attack patterns.

54:40.240 --> 54:40.880
Wait, hold on.

54:40.880 --> 54:42.800
Do you pull your hits, Justin, or do you-

54:42.800 --> 54:43.600
Absolutely not.

54:43.600 --> 54:44.800
I can't stress it enough.

54:44.800 --> 54:46.640
You got to go full blast at this goose.

54:46.640 --> 54:47.760
Give them everything you got,

54:47.760 --> 54:50.080
because that's what those shitty kids are going to be doing.

54:50.080 --> 54:50.400
Right.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.880
But if they can learn to defend themselves from you,

54:52.880 --> 54:53.680
they're going to be ready.

54:53.680 --> 54:54.960
When those shitty kids come,

54:54.960 --> 54:57.440
they're going to be flipping over them.

54:57.440 --> 54:59.840
They're going to be doing some sort of feather blast.

54:59.840 --> 55:03.360
I love this, because I was going to amend it to say,

55:03.360 --> 55:05.120
just like a Panda documentary I watch,

55:05.120 --> 55:06.720
what you have to do is dress like a goose

55:06.720 --> 55:09.760
and smear like goose poop and pee all over yourself,

55:09.760 --> 55:11.600
so that you smell like one of them.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.880
But what you're proposing is,

55:12.880 --> 55:16.080
what I would say is the polar opposite of that,

55:16.080 --> 55:19.600
where instead you're engaging them in the field of combat.

55:19.600 --> 55:19.840
Right.

55:19.840 --> 55:20.960
Travis, you're approaching it from

55:21.520 --> 55:23.680
an upsettingly humanist perspective.

55:23.680 --> 55:26.080
And I feel like this question asker is also

55:26.080 --> 55:29.120
engaging this topic with the same perspective of just like,

55:29.840 --> 55:32.560
there's an animal that doesn't inherently like me.

55:32.560 --> 55:34.320
Yeah, like that's fine.

55:34.320 --> 55:36.240
I think that's fine that some animals are like that,

55:36.240 --> 55:38.320
because we're definitely like that to like,

55:38.320 --> 55:41.280
anything that we can eat, but-

55:41.280 --> 55:43.680
Yeah, like Justin, you're only not like that to them,

55:43.680 --> 55:45.280
because you don't want to eat them today.

55:45.280 --> 55:45.600
Right.

55:45.600 --> 55:50.160
Like, what Justin is suggesting is that

55:50.160 --> 55:52.560
we enforce the habits that they already have.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.440
And because I think that's a healthy habit

55:55.440 --> 55:56.640
for some animals to have.

55:56.640 --> 56:03.120
Like I'm okay that geese are little feathered hate boats,

56:03.120 --> 56:04.880
essentially flying hate boats.

56:04.880 --> 56:07.280
Like I'm okay with that because like, that's fine.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.200
There should be some animals like that.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.320
I'm comfortable with that.

56:10.320 --> 56:12.800
And like kids are going to come shoot bottle rockets at you.

56:12.800 --> 56:14.480
So Justin's going to do it first

56:14.480 --> 56:15.680
to train you how to dodge the bottle rockets.

56:15.680 --> 56:16.880
He's going to toughen you up.

56:20.160 --> 56:21.200
So I hope that helps.

56:21.840 --> 56:23.280
The geese, play this for the geese.

56:23.280 --> 56:25.600
Can we get this information out to the geese somehow?

56:25.600 --> 56:26.000
Can we get this to geese?

56:26.000 --> 56:27.040
That's mutually beneficial,

56:27.040 --> 56:28.720
because that's a whole new demographic for us

56:28.720 --> 56:31.200
that is an untapped market as far as I know.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.920
Would you guys, how hard would you guys,

56:33.920 --> 56:36.240
if you guys were on iTunes and you saw a podcast,

56:36.240 --> 56:39.360
it's like for geese only, how to fight humans.

56:39.360 --> 56:40.880
Like I would so listen to that.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.240
But you're not allowed to Justin.

56:42.240 --> 56:44.480
I'd be breaking, well, it'd be all quacks and shit.

56:45.040 --> 56:46.720
Well, no, you would learn like how to,

56:46.720 --> 56:50.320
you would learn how to better kick a goose's ass.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.480
And that's not what we want to put out there for humans.

56:52.480 --> 56:54.400
We're already super duper good at it.

56:56.400 --> 56:57.840
There's going to be a war one day.

56:58.640 --> 57:00.400
Yeah, between geese and humans.

57:00.400 --> 57:03.760
And I don't, I want it to be, I want us to win.

57:03.760 --> 57:05.920
I'm not a fucking species traitor,

57:05.920 --> 57:08.480
but I do want them to be able to put up a fair fight.

57:08.480 --> 57:10.560
Yeah, you don't want to feel bad about winning.

57:10.560 --> 57:12.560
I would love for it to end in like a stalemate,

57:12.560 --> 57:13.920
lots of losses on both sides,

57:13.920 --> 57:15.840
where both of us like pull through,

57:16.640 --> 57:19.040
but there's like a begrudging respect is earned.

57:20.160 --> 57:21.840
And then there's one Christmas day

57:21.840 --> 57:24.240
where us and the geese all play soccer together.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.480
And then yeah, I would love to play soccer with the geese.

57:27.520 --> 57:28.640
I would do that in a heartbeat.

57:28.640 --> 57:29.840
That's going to do it for us folks.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.200
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

57:31.200 --> 57:33.200
We hope you had a lot of fun

57:33.200 --> 57:34.800
and a lot of laughs and frivolity.

57:35.680 --> 57:36.880
We certainly enjoyed ourselves.

57:37.840 --> 57:39.120
Thank you to everybody who bought tickets

57:39.120 --> 57:41.200
to see us in New York and DC.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.360
Those tickets sold out a day of.

57:43.360 --> 57:47.680
I think there may be a few single tickets for DC,

57:47.680 --> 57:50.400
but they sent out a super low ticket warning.

57:50.400 --> 57:52.560
So it's possible that by the time this goes up,

57:52.560 --> 57:53.440
they are gone.

57:53.440 --> 57:54.800
We learned last time we came to New York

57:54.800 --> 57:56.640
and did a theater that was like a hundred seats

57:56.640 --> 57:59.280
and it sold out like in 45 seconds.

57:59.280 --> 58:00.560
And we knew we fucked up instantly.

58:00.560 --> 58:03.280
Like we knew that it was going to sell really well there,

58:03.280 --> 58:06.160
but you guys like blew us the fuck away.

58:06.160 --> 58:08.320
Like, thank you so much.

58:08.320 --> 58:10.640
I hope we put on a show that is good enough

58:10.640 --> 58:14.800
to like warrant the insane enthusiasm you guys.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.920
So yeah, it looks like DC as we're recording this,

58:17.920 --> 58:20.480
you could still get some singles to DC.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.720
I don't know if you could get pairs to,

58:22.720 --> 58:24.640
yeah, well, it looks like you could get pairs together.

58:24.640 --> 58:25.840
Yeah, go, go quick.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.360
Those are not sold out.

58:27.360 --> 58:29.520
New York is sold out, I'm pretty sure.

58:29.520 --> 58:32.160
There's always a chance that, you know,

58:32.160 --> 58:34.000
there's resale tickets in New York

58:34.000 --> 58:36.240
or that there's maybe a waiting list.

58:36.240 --> 58:37.200
But I'm going to tell you the same thing

58:37.200 --> 58:38.640
that we say every time,

58:38.640 --> 58:41.360
which is there's always a chance that you show up day of

58:41.360 --> 58:43.440
and you're able to get in last minute

58:43.440 --> 58:44.560
because people don't show up,

58:44.560 --> 58:47.280
but there is absolutely no guarantee of that.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.280
And we would like to encourage people to do that.

58:49.280 --> 58:50.480
And then they're not able to get in.

58:50.480 --> 58:52.720
We know like if you don't live in Manhattan,

58:52.720 --> 58:54.080
like it can be tough to get down there.

58:54.080 --> 58:57.200
So like, we really don't want you to spend an hour on a train

58:57.200 --> 58:59.040
like coming to our show and then not be able to get in.

59:00.240 --> 59:01.120
So, we don't know.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.240
But in case you're wondering,

59:02.240 --> 59:04.320
that usually is a thing that you're able to do,

59:04.320 --> 59:05.920
but no guarantees.

59:07.280 --> 59:07.780
Okay.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.720
We want to encourage everybody to go check out

59:10.720 --> 59:14.080
all the other amazing Maximum Fun shows at MaximumFun.org.

59:14.640 --> 59:16.640
A lot of them are McElroy related,

59:16.640 --> 59:19.520
but even the ones who aren't are really, really great.

59:19.520 --> 59:21.680
We just added a new one called,

59:21.680 --> 59:23.760
I believe it's called The Greatest Generation

59:23.760 --> 59:26.720
for people who have maybe just started watching Star Trek

59:26.720 --> 59:29.680
or love Star Trek and feel that they're a little too old for it,

59:29.680 --> 59:30.320
which is silly.

59:30.320 --> 59:31.040
It's for everybody.

59:31.040 --> 59:31.840
It's really great.

59:31.840 --> 59:34.880
So listen to the podcast and feel included and feel involved

59:34.880 --> 59:37.040
and maybe learn a little bit about Star Trek.

59:37.040 --> 59:37.920
We also want to,

59:37.920 --> 59:40.720
if you want to learn all about every McElroy project

59:40.720 --> 59:42.160
that is out there in the world,

59:42.160 --> 59:44.320
you can go to McElroyShows.com.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.240
All our shows are on there.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.480
And also our Twitter accounts, Facebook groups,

59:51.360 --> 59:52.720
and contact information.

59:52.720 --> 59:54.720
So if you're looking to send in questions

59:54.720 --> 59:56.800
or mail something to us, it's all right there.

59:56.800 --> 59:59.440
I also want to mention that John Hodgman

59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.000
is doing a bunch of live shows for Judge John Hodgman.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.320
It's another amazing Max Fun podcast

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.360
that you should definitely be listening to,

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.040
but he's coming to DC and Philadelphia and Brooklyn

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.640
and Turner Falls.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.600
You can find out how to get tickets for those

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.200
at MaximumFun.org too.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.120
You should definitely go see that show.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.240
It's going to be very, very funny.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.560
Also, I want to say we know that it took us a long time

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.800
to schedule a live show for 2016.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.560
We didn't have one in the first half of the year.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.160
We're going to try to do more as we move forward.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.960
So we'll try to knock some more out in 2016

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.800
and maybe do some more in 2017.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.560
It's just a little bit hard to get them together,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.240
but we know that it's kind of a bummer

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.600
that it took us so long to get to one

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.120
and we'll do more this year, we promise.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.000
And if you want to keep track of that,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.320
make sure to follow us on Twitter at NBNBAM

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.360
and keep listening to the show.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.160
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:48.960
for the use of our theme song

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.760
instead of Parcher off the album,

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.720
Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.920
It's a very, very good album.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.120
And we are lucky that we're able to use it

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:55.920
as our theme song.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.240
Thank you.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.440
Thank you.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.920
Okay, that's going to do it for us.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.640
Yeah.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.080
Let's wrap this bad boy up.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.120
This final wrap up sent in by Steven Horchak.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:05.680
Thank you, Steven.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Donna who asks,

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.120
what is the national soup for USA?

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.640
My name is Justin McRoy.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.680
I'm Travis McRoy.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.800
I'm Griffin McRoy.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.760
It's been my brother, my brother,

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:29.360
may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.640
Maximum fun.org.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.680
Comedy and culture.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.800

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.840
Listener supported.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.480
Hi, I'm Sydney McElroy.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.760
And I'm Riley Smurl.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.480
And we co-host a podcast called Still Buffering,

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.880
a sister's guide to teens through the ages.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.400
On our show, we tackle all of the hot teen topics

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.320
that kids have on their minds today.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.160
Hot teen topics?

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.160
Well, you know, the questions that are plaguing teenagers

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.880
through their tumultuous growing years.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.280
Questions like, how do I party?

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.240
Or what do I do with all this hair everywhere?

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.640
The same questions that people like Sydney

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.880
had during their years as teenagers.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.200
Many, many, many.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.160
Okay, not that many.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.000
So, so long ago.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.600
Yeah, okay, I think they get the idea.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.760
So search for Still Buffering on iTunes or Maximumfun.org

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.920
for new episodes every Tuesday.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.960
Still Buffering.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.080
I am a teenager.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:47.280
And I was too.
