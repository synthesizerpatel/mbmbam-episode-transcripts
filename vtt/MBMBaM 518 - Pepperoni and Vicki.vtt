00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.880
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

00:46.880 --> 00:50.560
an Advice Show for the Modron Era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.760
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.760 --> 01:00.960
My, my, my, is that the Piper?

01:00.960 --> 01:04.800
He's back, and I know that- real quick, guys, we should've talked about this before we started

01:04.800 --> 01:07.200
recording. I know this is gonna be our super chill Certamax fun drive.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.160
It's going for four weeks, but I thought we could go, like, this first week,

01:10.160 --> 01:11.760
like, pretty fucking heavy on it.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.600
It's me, the Piper!

01:13.600 --> 01:15.440
Yeah, exactly that type of energy. I love it.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.120
I am the Piper!

01:17.120 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, and-

01:18.000 --> 01:21.760
It's I. The bill has come due, respectfully.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.560
It's unbelievable to me that you would not know this at this point,

01:24.560 --> 01:28.480
but we are a part of the Maximum Fun Network, which is artist-owned.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.200
That's right, we're artists and supported.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.880
If you take one thing away from the day, let it be that.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.680
We are artists.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.120
This podcast is just as good as a painting or photograph.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.760
But more importantly, we're audience-supported, so we are asking over the next few weeks that

01:43.760 --> 01:47.360
you become a member of the Maximum Fun family.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.680
Just head on over to maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.720
You can choose a monthly amount that's comfortable for you.

01:54.720 --> 02:01.600
A lot of people do five or ten bucks a month, and some even go as high as 20 or 35 or $100.

02:01.600 --> 02:07.280
Or there's one insane person that pledged $100,000 for a single night with me,

02:07.280 --> 02:10.000
but I said, no, I shan't.

02:10.720 --> 02:15.520
This is a way that you can support the shows of the network and say that I like this.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.200
You help to make these shows happen.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.040
You're the reason that we can, like, do them as regularly as we can.

02:21.040 --> 02:26.640
And, you know, just to be quite honest with you, things have been weird for you.

02:26.640 --> 02:27.680
We absolutely get that.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.200
They've been weird for us, too.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.440
We had to cancel a lot of live shows and book tours and stuff like that.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.160
The stuff that makes our business a business.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.560
And now we come to you hat in hand with Fallon, like Icarus,

02:42.160 --> 02:44.160
to just begging for your scraps.

02:44.160 --> 02:49.360
So please toss some scraps our way at maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.720
That was a chill vibe.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.680
That vibe was pretty chill.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.920
There's rewards and there's stuff you get and everything.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.920
Yeah, you get gifts, but the gift is knowing that you're part of the family.

02:57.920 --> 02:58.720
Yeah, the family.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, we'll talk a little bit more about it later on.

03:02.800 --> 03:08.240
I promise we're not going to do the usual extended chats that we usually do during the

03:08.240 --> 03:09.760
Max Fun Drive, but yeah.

03:09.760 --> 03:10.160
Should we-

03:10.160 --> 03:11.120
Brief chats.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.880
A brief sort of sermon or lecture, even.

03:14.880 --> 03:15.680
Does it sound good?

03:16.320 --> 03:18.240
Juice, you want to kick us off with a little question?

03:18.240 --> 03:22.480
We should start with riddle me this boys.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.200
We can't say, hey guys, it would be cool to give us money.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.600
And then Travis is like, and here's what you get for the money.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.920
And then he throws up all over you and your hair.

03:29.920 --> 03:35.760
Riddle me this boys, riddle me this.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.160
Okay.

03:36.160 --> 03:43.840
I took the money that people donate to the Max Fun Network and I paid composer Michael

03:43.840 --> 03:49.040
Giacchino to write me a kind of like opener.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.680
I paid him $150,000 for that.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.400
Well, that was too much money for a bad song.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.120
Oh, damn it.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.160
Okay, well, we've got two here.

03:58.160 --> 03:58.480
Okay.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.320
Wow.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.160
One is just a quick one and another one's a real brain scratcher.

04:04.160 --> 04:04.480
Okay.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.200
So Hazel sent this one.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.720
Well, and let me be clear, fair to Hazel.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.200
This was not Hazel's question, mind you.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.480
We know Hazel found this.

04:14.480 --> 04:14.720
Okay.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.080
There was a huge painting in an art museum.

04:18.640 --> 04:23.040
Everyone looks at it more than the quote Mona Lisa in quote.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.280
Why is that?

04:25.280 --> 04:26.480
Why did it need to be?

04:26.480 --> 04:26.720
Okay.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.680
Yet the painter is not famous.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.160
Why?

04:31.280 --> 04:32.800
Is it the map to the museum?

04:34.080 --> 04:35.120
A good guess, but no.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.960
Because it's the map.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.840
I said the map.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.160
Yeah, but I said it with confidence.

04:42.160 --> 04:42.960
Oh, I like that.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.680
Yes.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.880
No, the answer is the huge painting was the wall.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.000
And then this is why I really enjoyed this.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.800
No one is usually famous for painting a wall.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.120
Well, is it a pain?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.720
Is that a pain?

04:56.720 --> 05:02.560
If I paint my den cream eggshell off white and at the end of I'm like,

05:03.120 --> 05:04.720
look, what do you think of my new piece?

05:04.720 --> 05:05.440
Mm-hmm.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.600
What do you think I'm saying with this new piece?

05:07.600 --> 05:12.640
The Sistine Chapel was originally just a sort of nice beige color all over.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.120
But then he spilled a bunch of fucking paint upwards

05:15.120 --> 05:17.760
and it just so happened to make a pretty cool lord.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.880
This is my piece.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.240
This is my piece that I did when I originally painted the roof of the Sistine Chapel.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.280
The Sistine Chapel?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
Well, it was the 16th one they built.

05:27.280 --> 05:27.760
Yeah, sure.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.840
I would also argue, folks,

05:31.840 --> 05:34.480
that a lot of people have gotten famous for painting walls.

05:34.480 --> 05:35.840
Banksy for one.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.760
Banksy's pretty well known for painting on walls.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.440
Yeah, that is true.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.280
Banksy doesn't just take a pan and a roller and try out.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.760
I went for kind of a lavender with this one.

05:47.760 --> 05:51.360
Do you feel like Banksy right now is getting halfway through something

05:51.360 --> 05:53.440
and then something else even wilder happens?

05:53.440 --> 05:54.720
He's like, well, damn it.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.040
Guess I gotta go do a Banksy about that now.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.880
I bet the best part about being Banksy is half the time you didn't do it,

06:00.880 --> 06:02.400
but you can be like, that was me.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.920
But you can't be like, that was me,

06:03.920 --> 06:05.600
because then that would have ruined the whole thing.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.160
Okay, we got one more here and this one-

06:08.160 --> 06:09.200
Just one?

06:09.200 --> 06:10.000
I know.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.640
This one is really gonna twist your noodle.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.760
What came out from one hole and goes into two holes?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.160
Jesus.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.120
Is the answer gross?

06:21.120 --> 06:22.160
Can you tell us the answer?

06:22.160 --> 06:23.200
The answer is gross.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.480
The answer is puerile.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.080
Is it pee pee?

06:27.040 --> 06:27.600
No.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.320
A tongue?

06:29.360 --> 06:31.200
No, the answer is farts.

06:32.080 --> 06:37.120
And it took me a long time to figure out what the two holes they were referring to was.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.120
There's so many holes it goes in.

06:41.120 --> 06:46.000
You can't just say, you can't definitively say it goes into two holes.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.920
I'm looking around my room right now.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.840
There's a few, there's like power outlets.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.720
That's three holes per outlet.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.560
Like you can't tell me it doesn't go in there.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.280
And that's gross.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.280
And I don't want it to be in the show,

06:57.280 --> 07:01.520
but like there's a ceiling vent that has so many holes in it.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.600
Wait, whenever the power goes out in my house,

07:03.600 --> 07:05.200
the electricity never comes over and it's like,

07:05.200 --> 07:07.520
well, it's cause so many farts went into the plugs.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.480
It's so crazy.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.680
All your electric pipes got clogged up with farts.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.040
It's like my body even has more than two holes in it.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.840
And you can't tell me that it doesn't go back in a little bit.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.640
Do you know what I mean?

07:18.640 --> 07:21.040
Like this is a, this sucks.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.240
They soak it in the electrical wiring.

07:24.240 --> 07:28.400
Think about Ghost Rider has to travel along those to get from room to room.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.360
Oh no.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.440
Hey, do you think Ghost Rider when a kid farted was ever like, it was Tommy?

07:33.440 --> 07:36.560
Like, he was just like, I absolutely, I'm a ghost.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.520
I know exactly who did it.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.920
I can smell the farts on my wavelength.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.480
Or made it spell it like automata poetically, like behind their butt.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.520
And they're like, oh, come on.

07:45.520 --> 07:45.840
Rap.

07:46.480 --> 07:46.880
Yeah.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.840
Oh, don't.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.400
Oh man.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.600
I was just sitting here reading my high and lowest cartoon

07:53.600 --> 07:55.440
and you took the words out of high and low.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.520
So it said rap behind my buttocks.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.400
Right behind my butt.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.000
And he can even do that even if you didn't rip.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.960
Yep.

08:02.960 --> 08:03.360
Oh yeah.

08:03.360 --> 08:03.920
Yeah.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.400
Just like.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.280
It's Ghost Rider's whole thing.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.120
Sometimes Ghost Rider just has beef.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.240
Just wants to embarrass you.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.280
You're like, hey, okay.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.120
I'm sorry I didn't come to your birthday party.

08:11.120 --> 08:11.840
You're a ghost.

08:13.120 --> 08:13.760
Now can we do?

08:14.720 --> 08:15.520
Yes.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.480
Yeah, I'd like that.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.600
I really would.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.000
I know it would be nice just to spend some time with my brothers.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.360
I just met a cute girl.

08:23.360 --> 08:27.440
Within five minutes of conversation, I told her I was going to visit some friends across the state

08:27.440 --> 08:28.960
about a three hour drive.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.840
She exclaims that her father opened a pizza shop in that area.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.120
She asked for my number.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.680
I'm instructed to tell her father that she sent me.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.320
I will likely receive free pizza.

08:38.320 --> 08:42.720
Do I get pizza from this girl's father or is it too early to meet her parents?

08:44.160 --> 08:45.360
What a wild.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.360
Hey, Vicky sent me.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.160
Excuse me.

08:50.160 --> 08:50.720
Excuse me.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.200
Pepperoni and Vicky.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.080
Who is Vicky?

08:58.080 --> 09:00.720
Who is Vicky?

09:00.720 --> 09:01.760
Is there an owner here?

09:02.720 --> 09:03.360
Is the owner?

09:03.360 --> 09:05.040
Can I talk to the owner?

09:05.040 --> 09:06.160
Is the dad here?

09:06.160 --> 09:06.720
Is daddy here?

09:06.720 --> 09:08.320
Is that Vicky's dad?

09:08.320 --> 09:09.360
I'm looking for daddy.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.400
Who made Vicky?

09:12.400 --> 09:14.320
Who made Vicky here?

09:14.320 --> 09:18.080
I'll have a large pepperoni and one Vicky's dad, please.

09:18.080 --> 09:27.920
What size, shape, and organization of pie would you order when your plan to pay for

09:27.920 --> 09:30.000
it is I know Vicky?

09:32.160 --> 09:34.080
You got to go small, right?

09:34.080 --> 09:37.840
It's got to be small, personal pan, single topping.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.400
I don't want to be a bother, but I do know Vicky.

09:40.400 --> 09:45.120
And I am trying to get with her right now.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.880
Right now, don't worry about that, daddy.

09:46.880 --> 09:47.760
Can I call you daddy?

09:48.400 --> 09:54.080
Right now, can I say, hungry and confused in Ohio, there's one word in this entire

09:54.080 --> 09:57.040
question that maybe is the one that trips me up the most.

09:57.040 --> 09:57.840
I know it.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.320
I know this word.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.360
It is likely.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.560
Yes, this is the word.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.920
Yes, the word likely.

10:01.920 --> 10:10.080
If Vicky herself cannot give you the Vicky guarantee that this plan is going to pan out,

10:10.080 --> 10:10.560
there is no-

10:10.560 --> 10:11.760
Personal pan out.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.400
Personal pan out.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.040
There is no fucking way you can try and execute it.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.720
Because there's the chance that this happens.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.640
I'll have one pizza, please.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.720
And also Vicky sent me, okay?

10:23.680 --> 10:24.800
I don't have any money.

10:24.800 --> 10:28.000
Joke's on you, I don't like Vicky.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.680
That is, that will cost you $100.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.840
Vicky is my worst child, by far.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.960
Because she keeps giving away free pizzas.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.560
I am a small business owner.

10:40.560 --> 10:45.040
I've just recently opened this establishment and everyone Vicky talks to for five minutes

10:45.040 --> 10:49.200
sends them three hours my way to get one free pizza.

10:49.200 --> 10:53.120
I'm giving away pies here because of those loose Vicky lips.

10:53.120 --> 10:58.880
I think it's probably more likely that Vicky's trying to drum up business for her dad's pizza.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.240
Like, doesn't that make more sense?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.600
Like, my dad makes good pizza.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.920
Go see him to have the pizza.

11:03.920 --> 11:07.600
Vicky gets 10% of everything for a referral fee.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.100
Yeah.

11:08.720 --> 11:14.240
The worst response you could get, I think, is Vicky.

11:15.440 --> 11:19.360
Why, Vicky died 75 years ago this very night.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.960
There hasn't been a Vicky here for 75 years.

11:22.960 --> 11:27.280
And also, to be fair, I died 80 years ago tonight.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.680
So, do you want some ghost-a-roni on your ghost pizza?

11:31.680 --> 11:33.600
Thank you for coming to our theme.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.560
Some scaranera.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.640
Some scaranera sauce.

11:36.640 --> 11:42.720
Oh God, the fucking crypt keeper has entered.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.360
Ashes to ashes, crust to crust.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.920
Here, have a little mush gloom.

11:47.920 --> 11:54.320
And maybe a side of pain apples.

11:58.320 --> 12:05.440
I will say that if you go to this pizza store owner and drop Vicky's name and say that she

12:05.440 --> 12:11.360
said you could get some free pizza and he says Vicky died 75 years ago, I think you

12:11.360 --> 12:15.440
could make a pretty sound argument that you should super get the pizza now.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.520
Yeah, it sounds like Vicky's unfinished business.

12:17.520 --> 12:23.360
Vicky's ghost or angel came to you in a vision and told you, be not afraid.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.880
Go visit my dad or grandson.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.760
I'm not entirely sure what unclear what it is.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.080
And get this zah.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.440
So that I can finally rest.

12:35.440 --> 12:39.120
So that I may die and pass on into oblivion.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.640
Here's a Yahoo.

12:40.640 --> 12:41.520
Can I read it?

12:41.520 --> 12:42.720
Can you do it?

12:42.720 --> 12:45.120
This one was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.000
Thank you, Graham.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.680
Graham crushed it this week.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.000
Really did not fake the funk.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.240
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user Felix who asks, in food and drink, beer, wine, and spirits

12:56.240 --> 12:56.640
category.

12:56.640 --> 13:02.240
So that's like this is one of the rare times where they actually have selected a very appropriate

13:02.240 --> 13:02.800
category.

13:02.800 --> 13:08.080
Felix asks, which years are the good wine years?

13:09.520 --> 13:14.000
I've only had ever a couple sips of wine in my life, but I always hear people who are wine

13:14.000 --> 13:16.880
experts saying stuff like, that was a good year.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.920
I want to sound like I know what I'm talking about if someone ever offers me wine.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.960
So I was wondering if anyone knows what all the good wine years are.

13:22.960 --> 13:27.680
And I am just now realizing, fam, that we did do a question last week about how to sound

13:27.680 --> 13:29.200
like you know what beer is like.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.400
So this is sort of a sequel, like a squequel to that.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.680
And that was unintentional.

13:33.680 --> 13:41.120
But I don't, people who like know a lot of different sort of like wines and vineyards,

13:41.120 --> 13:45.440
that in and of itself is sort of like remarkable.

13:45.440 --> 13:49.120
I mean, I know upwards of 300 Pokemon, so maybe it's just like a different way that

13:49.120 --> 13:53.040
we have prioritized spending our memory storage.

13:53.040 --> 14:00.160
But the people who can be like, ah, the Fibonacci vineyard, that was a good one.

14:00.160 --> 14:07.120
And also in 2003, 2007, 2009, their grapes were dope.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.480
Like, how do you do that?

14:08.480 --> 14:10.720
That seems like they're making shit up.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.920
Griffin, they are.

14:12.480 --> 14:19.120
That is what it all boils down to, is like so much of that is uncheckable.

14:19.120 --> 14:26.400
If I say, ah, a delicious, this Dreaming Tree Zinfandel from the vineyards of Dave Matthews.

14:26.400 --> 14:26.720
Yeah.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.200
Ah, delicious, 1998, what a good year.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.160
What are you going to do?

14:30.800 --> 14:35.920
Google, was 1998 a good year for Dave Matthews Zinfandel wine?

14:35.920 --> 14:38.800
What year did Dave Matthews make the best wine?

14:38.800 --> 14:43.840
Right, but like, Google that right now, Griffin, and watch your computer explode.

14:43.840 --> 14:50.000
Well, I got what year did Dave, and it filled in what year did Dave Thomas die, and I got sad.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.800
Oh, no.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.360
So thank you, that's why I stopped, I stopped.

14:53.360 --> 14:58.320
I'm saying there is no, like, even then, if someone was like, well, that wasn't a good year,

14:58.320 --> 15:01.760
and you're like, it was for this bottle, okay, cool.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.440
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.880
Good, it got me.

15:04.880 --> 15:05.680
Just got me.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.800
The good year, what you can fake is the good years differ by region.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.360
So if you're like, is it 2012?

15:13.360 --> 15:14.560
That sounds very good.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.400
They'll be like, no, it's not good.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.320
You're like, oh, I didn't, is that Napa?

15:18.320 --> 15:19.280
My mistake, sorry.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.560
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.240
Sorry, I tend to stay in Tuscany.

15:24.960 --> 15:32.400
If you want me to take a soldier on state side, I suppose I could sully my palate.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.520
I suppose I could sully my palate.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.360
You could also just go safe and just always say, like, that was an average year for wine.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.000
Oh, okay, yeah, that was fine.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.800
That was not my, not my favorite year for wine.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.320
But not the worst.

15:47.200 --> 15:52.640
If someone brings out 69, you can say, oh, nice.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.120
Yeah.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.160
And then if they're like, actually, it's pretty bad, you'd say, oh, no, I was actually

15:58.160 --> 16:02.800
remarking on the fact that you said 69, I was just trying to support you because you said 69.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.560
That also works if someone brings out a wine from the year 420.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.240
Then you can be like, ah.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.760
What a dank blend this is.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.680
I can't wait to drink that and die.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.120
I mean, would you?

16:20.320 --> 16:20.820
Die?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.200
It probably wouldn't be very good.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.520
No, it's corked.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.040
That's corked for sure.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.400
This one's corked.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.280
This is corked.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.800
That one's going to need to be decanted.

16:31.360 --> 16:35.440
It's got, it's got ancient viral streams in it.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.520
Okay, they hand you the, they hand you the bottle.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.840
You look at the year, you say, oh, you waited too long.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.360
This is vinegar now.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.160
And then you up in the bottle and dump it on the ground.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.200
And then no one can check if you're right or not.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.280
They're just going to assume that you knew what you were doing.

16:51.280 --> 16:55.360
Just chuck the unopened bottle through the nearest plate glass window.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.120
And when they're like, you broke my home.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.720
You say, no, you broke my evening with this vinegar wine.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.280
With this vinegar.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.360
You brought vinegar to our home.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.480
I have another idea.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.760
This is very good.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.840
You get the bottle, you inspect the year.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.840
You say, ah, 2001, a delightful vintage.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.360
May I saber it?

17:17.360 --> 17:22.720
And then you just smash it to pieces.

17:22.720 --> 17:27.040
Repeat until only beer is left.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.280
Repeat until there are only boxes left.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.440
And then everybody could agree on the quality of those.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.640
Justin, if I may, another suggestion.

17:34.640 --> 17:38.320
They hand it to you, you say, ah, 2001, an excellent christening wine.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.320
Then you like smash it on the nearest ship or a vessel or whatever.

17:42.320 --> 17:42.800
What have you.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.120
That's good.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.400
You could also just say like, ah, what year is this from?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.960
2009, a fantastic year.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.920
And they'll be like, actually, it was a bad year for this vineyard.

17:53.920 --> 17:58.560
And you would say, I meant, generally speaking, for me.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.320
I had a fucking avatar.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.240
Kick ass, dude.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.280
Loved it.

18:04.400 --> 18:04.720
Did you see the avatar?

18:04.720 --> 18:08.240
I had a great make out sesh with someone I had a crush on.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.440
It was a fine year.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.960
My pubes finally blossomed.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.640
It was excellent.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.240
An excellent year.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.080
Family guy.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.840
Terrific season.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.280
Speaking of years, it's this time of year.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.160
Well, actually, it's not.

18:26.160 --> 18:26.960
Damn it.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.800
It's not even this time of year, is it?

18:28.800 --> 18:29.120
No.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.160
It's Max Fun Drive.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.080
And there's some amazing gifts I want to tell you about.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.040
And let me tell you, it's like, can I give them the URL first?

18:35.040 --> 18:36.880
And he's like, please, you don't need to convince me.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.600
It's maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.040
Please just beat Travis to the punch and just go there right now.

18:43.040 --> 18:43.360
Yeah.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.800
Because if he tells you about the gifts, if you donate right now,

18:46.800 --> 18:50.480
now, then you can always know you did it with a purity of spirit.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.800
If you wait until my brother tells you the gifts,

18:52.800 --> 18:56.240
then you're going to have to always carry around that question.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.200
Why did I do it?

18:57.200 --> 19:00.160
Did I just do it for the things or for the love, you know?

19:00.960 --> 19:01.680
So true.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.920
So it's the first one, right off the bat, the best one, as far as I'm concerned,

19:05.920 --> 19:08.800
for $5 a month.

19:08.800 --> 19:14.160
$5 gets you exclusive members only bonus content.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.440
And not just from this year.

19:15.440 --> 19:20.080
From every Max Fun Drive, every piece of bonus content up till now.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.760
It's like over 200 hours of bonus content.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.880
And there's some really incredible stuff in there.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.240
And I'm not just saying it.

19:28.240 --> 19:32.160
One of the ones I'm most excited about is on the Adventure Zone.

19:32.160 --> 19:38.960
We played D&D, me, Justin, Griffin, and Dad with Matt Mercer DMing

19:38.960 --> 19:43.120
with like all new characters, all new story, all of Matt's creation.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.880
It was so much fun.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.000
And I think it's one of the few times, aside from, I think, Dadlands,

19:48.000 --> 19:51.120
where the four of us got to like actually all play together.

19:51.120 --> 19:51.760
Yeah.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.440
It was an absolute blast.

19:53.440 --> 19:53.920
Check that out.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.120
There's a ton of stuff there.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.120
For $10 a month, you get the bonus content.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.080
Plus, you get an enamel pin.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.000
It's a Max Fun Drive exclusive enamel pin.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.600
And there's one for each show.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.520
This has been a hit every year.

20:05.520 --> 20:06.880
They're absolutely gorgeous.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.720
They're designed by Megan Lynn Cott.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.120
And they're gorgeous.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.680
If you've ever seen a cool Max Fun pin,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.120
it's probably one of the drive pins.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.360
And you get to pick whichever one you want.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.280
And you get a membership card.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.040
So for $20, you get the pin.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.000
You get the membership card.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.240
You get the over 200 hours of bonus content.

20:24.240 --> 20:29.600
And you get a Max Fun game pack that includes Max Fun inspired playing cards

20:29.600 --> 20:31.600
and all kinds of cool stuff.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.800
Dice, dice back.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.840
And then for $35, you get the Max Fun game kit.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.640
You get the pin, the membership card, all the bonus content,

20:38.640 --> 20:42.240
and a Rocket Camp mug, which is frankly my favorite kind of mug.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.120
Those kind of enamelly ones, you know, with the speckles.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.400
Makes you look really cool.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.000
And there's more, but you can go check those out.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.320
One more time, Justin, give them that URL.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.200
It's maximumfun.org forward slash join.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.680
Also, we fully realize it's not a great time to be asking for money

20:59.680 --> 21:03.280
because there's lots of very worthy causes to be giving to.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.520
And we also know that a lot of people are not in a financial position

21:07.520 --> 21:09.280
to become Max Fun members.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.000
And we fully, fully, fully understand that.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.360
We're just asking that if you are in a position to invest in this show,

21:17.360 --> 21:18.720
in this network, in this community,

21:18.720 --> 21:22.240
we really appreciate you sort of supporting our ability

21:22.240 --> 21:23.600
to continue to make these shows.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.840
Which, you know, now that we aren't touring or doing anything else,

21:27.840 --> 21:32.560
like that's where we're earning our living right now.

21:32.560 --> 21:36.160
So yeah, go to maximumfun.org slash join.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.680
Look at all the different ways you can give.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.840
We really, really appreciate you.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.040
And yeah, should we do something else?

21:43.760 --> 21:44.080
Yeah.

21:44.080 --> 21:44.400
Yes.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.560
My wife and I recently moved into our first home together.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.120
My wife.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.120
May I feel back?

21:55.760 --> 21:59.360
I mean, like, I just asked people to consider becoming Max Fun members

21:59.360 --> 22:00.240
and then I-

22:00.240 --> 22:01.600
And then you fucked it up.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.080
You know what?

22:02.720 --> 22:03.920
Here's my solemn pledge.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.720
No more, no more my wife.

22:06.720 --> 22:12.240
I will become a recurring $100 a month member of our own network

22:12.880 --> 22:14.640
if you stick to that promise.

22:15.360 --> 22:19.920
No more my wife's 2020.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.760
I can't promise 2021.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.800
In five months, you're back on your bullshit.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.040
Okay.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.120
My wife and I.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.200
And I.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.120
Wow, Trev, good job.

22:35.120 --> 22:35.600
Really good.

22:35.600 --> 22:35.920
Thank you.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.000
And I recently moved into our first home together.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.720
Upon removing a ceiling tile in the basement,

22:40.720 --> 22:45.920
an entire stack of the previous owner's porno VHS and DVDs

22:45.920 --> 22:47.440
fell out of the ceiling and onto the floor.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.000
What do we do?

22:48.720 --> 22:53.040
Do we reach out to the previous owner to see if they want them back?

22:53.040 --> 22:54.880
That's from Surprised in Milwaukee.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.160
Well, not that one.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.920
You've identified the worst possible solution.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.000
The one that you shouldn't do and it's good.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.840
Weed that out because that's going to help us.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.200
Hey, is this dog?

23:03.200 --> 23:06.720
You used to live in one, two, three, five house street.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.600
Cool, cool.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.560
I got all your dirty skin, folks.

23:10.560 --> 23:15.360
You want me to just drop them off like loose in a pile on your front lawn or what?

23:16.320 --> 23:20.480
I can arrange them into a fun shape like a butt on your lawn.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.080
You do?

23:22.960 --> 23:23.200
Huh?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.640
You really do want that?

23:25.360 --> 23:25.840
Okay.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.160
You need that.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.840
Goodbye, sir.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.760
You were waiting for me to find them.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.880
That's how you get your kicks?

23:34.880 --> 23:36.640
Oh my goodness gracious.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.040
You still live in the house.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.600
I just haven't seen you.

23:42.160 --> 23:42.800
Oh no.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.120
You're controlling my four-year-old.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.960
You're possessing my four-year-old.

23:49.840 --> 23:50.720
It's the worst.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.400
That got weird.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.760
It got so weird.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.720
I didn't even see that coming.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.120
Yeah, you can't reach out to this person.

23:57.120 --> 23:57.360
No.

23:57.360 --> 24:07.040
Um, I would not, I would never shame anyone for sexual gratification, personal sexual gratification.

24:07.040 --> 24:13.600
But I do have to question, uh boy, time to have some good masturbating time.

24:14.160 --> 24:21.520
I better go get this, I better go get the stepladder so I can get my adult felt.

24:21.520 --> 24:28.000
I have to place this gem into this divot in this staff and wait for the sun to shine in

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
through the basement window at exactly 12 PM.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.280
I need to contact my brothers to get them to bring their safety deposit box keys down

24:37.280 --> 24:41.040
to the bank with me so we can unlock the drawer and I can-

24:41.040 --> 24:43.200
Where do you keep your porno?

24:43.200 --> 24:45.600
The shrine of the silver monkey.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.040
That is a wild-

24:51.040 --> 24:53.680
The temple guard comes out like, again, man?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.720
Three times today.

24:56.720 --> 25:01.120
It's weird to think that you're so embarrassed of your pornography that you hide it in your

25:01.120 --> 25:07.200
literal ceiling, but not so embarrassed that you mind people thinking you use a stepladder

25:07.200 --> 25:08.240
four times a day.

25:08.240 --> 25:08.720
Right.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.240
Just scooting it back and forth.

25:10.240 --> 25:14.880
What exactly has happened here is they hid it so good that they forgot.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.600
They forgot.

25:15.600 --> 25:25.200
And, you know, in many ways, they clearly have moved on with their lives because, like,

25:26.720 --> 25:31.360
if they were needing that on a regular basis, they probably would have noticed by now, right?

25:32.400 --> 25:33.920
It's not like they misplaced-

25:33.920 --> 25:37.440
Well, Trav, bud, here's a fact from me to you.

25:37.440 --> 25:42.800
They guarantee they noticed 15 minutes after they left the house, but there is no remedy

25:42.800 --> 25:44.880
for this situation from their perspective, right?

25:44.880 --> 25:45.520
That is fair.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.840
They can't be like, you know, I think I forgot some stuff.

25:49.840 --> 25:55.280
I just need to get into the basement and into the ceiling of the basement, please.

25:55.280 --> 26:02.320
I mean, another possibility here, it's funny, I learned while doing Wonderful last week

26:02.320 --> 26:10.960
about votive hordes, which are treasure hordes that people would create, and the idea behind

26:10.960 --> 26:15.920
a votive horde is that it is not intended to be recovered by that person.

26:15.920 --> 26:22.000
It is a purposeful abandonment of those items, usually for sort of ritual practices.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.360
Maybe that's what it is.

26:23.360 --> 26:29.280
They have all these porno tapes and DVDs, and they hovered them over the garbage can.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.560
And tintypes.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.760
And tintypes, yes, and kinetoscopes or whatever.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.880
They had an old Nickelodeon that you could-

26:37.920 --> 26:40.320
This is like sexy as wax cylinder.

26:40.320 --> 26:45.280
Yes, and they held them over the garbage can, and they just thought, friends, we've had

26:45.280 --> 26:51.280
so many great times cranking to you, and I can't throw you in the garbage, but I can't

26:51.280 --> 26:52.320
put you in the river.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.960
What if fish see you?

26:54.960 --> 26:58.720
What if fish see you and get horny for people?

26:58.720 --> 27:00.800
I don't know how that would even work.

27:00.800 --> 27:06.080
Garbage volcano is a super good idea, but it hasn't been invented yet, so I guess I

27:06.080 --> 27:08.640
gotta put you in the ceiling of the basement forever.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.440
It's my favorite scene in Incredible Mr. Limpet when he's like,

27:11.440 --> 27:13.120
Oh yeah, skin fleas!

27:13.120 --> 27:14.160
Oh boy!

27:14.160 --> 27:16.400
Somebody dumped a big bag of porno!

27:16.400 --> 27:18.480
Do you guys ever think about pirates-

27:18.480 --> 27:19.680
The Incredible Mr. Limpet?

27:19.680 --> 27:20.000
Yeah, we-

27:20.000 --> 27:22.800
Do you judge by the content of this show constantly?

27:22.800 --> 27:27.520
Yes, but pirates, do you think like when they bury their gold, and then like two days later

27:27.520 --> 27:29.360
they're at the store and they're like, fuck!

27:29.360 --> 27:31.600
I do want to buy the shit!

27:31.600 --> 27:32.800
Everybody back on the boat!

27:33.680 --> 27:38.480
And I guess the bigger question is if Mr. Incredible Mr. Limpet does see human pornography

27:38.480 --> 27:41.120
if he becomes the Incredible Mr. Stiff It.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.480
And that's a funny joke.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.800
And folks, and folks, that's a funny one.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.800
That's one you can take out on the road.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.040
Take that one out on tour.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.040
You really spin the wheels on that one.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.560
Give it some time to breathe.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.320
Everyone's gonna enjoy that one.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.440
Let it aerate a bit.

27:57.440 --> 28:09.840
Hey, let's do a quick tip, a quick splash in the soothing waters of the Money Zone.

28:13.840 --> 28:19.600
During these quarantine times, it can be tough to add a little variety to your life.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.440
Let me recommend DoorDash.

28:23.440 --> 28:28.640
It's an app you get on your phone and then you look for the kind of cuisine that you'd

28:28.640 --> 28:33.680
like to eat, all local places, and you order what you want and they bring it to you.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.840
It's just as easy as that.

28:35.840 --> 28:40.320
And maybe there's a new place to open up and you're like, hey, they're on DoorDash.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.600
I'm gonna give them a try.

28:41.600 --> 28:45.440
That's a great way to try new food, add a little variety, something new to talk about.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.960
Food you're craving right now, right to your door.

28:48.960 --> 28:56.000
I have been using DoorDash, not an exaggeration, at least four times a week, maybe five, maybe

28:56.000 --> 29:04.320
more, a lot to keep my family fed like some sort of brave hunter-gatherer in these times.

29:04.320 --> 29:08.160
And it is such a smooth service.

29:08.160 --> 29:13.360
So rarely are there hiccups and when there are, they are so quick and responsive to fix

29:13.360 --> 29:14.320
any problems that you have.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.600
It's a wonderful service.

29:15.600 --> 29:20.320
Right now, our listeners can get $5 off their first order of $15 or more and zero delivery

29:20.320 --> 29:24.000
fees for the first month when you download the DoorDash app and enter code BROTHER.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.400
That's $5 off your first order and zero delivery fees for a month when you download the DoorDash

29:30.400 --> 29:33.600
app in the App Store and enter code BROTHER.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.280
Don't forget, that's code BROTHER for $5 off your first order with DoorDash.

29:37.280 --> 29:38.320
Look around you.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.600
One thing is missing.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.560
It's a website.

29:40.560 --> 29:45.360
You do not have one and you need one because it's 2020 and you're not gonna get it.

29:45.360 --> 29:50.800
And everything else is on fire, but the internet surprisingly still going strong.

29:50.800 --> 29:56.160

Stamps.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.320
Gotta get them.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.520
You need them, but you gotta stay away from crowds because of virus.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.440
But what if you need to go to the post office?

30:37.440 --> 30:40.480
What if you need posters to send out letters and packages?

30:40.480 --> 30:44.400
Well, don't be a real silly goose because stamps.com is here to help.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.680

Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in my

31:24.000 --> 31:25.920
brother, all one word, that's stamps.com.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.120
Enter my brother.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.280
Stay safe, my friends!

31:30.400 --> 31:34.240
I started listening to Ono, Ross, and Carey shortly after I broke my arm and the doctor

31:34.240 --> 31:36.320
had told me I'd never walk again.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.840
I couldn't get my book started.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.600
I was lost, honestly.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.760
I knew it was time to make a change.

31:42.480 --> 31:46.800
There's something about Ono, Ross, and Carey that you just can't get anywhere else.

31:46.800 --> 31:50.320
They're thought leaders, discoverers, founders.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.680
I'd call them heroes.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.280
Ross and Carey don't just report on French science, spirituality, and claims of the

31:55.280 --> 31:56.240
paranormal.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.520
They take part themselves.

31:57.520 --> 32:00.000
They show up so you don't have to.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.160
But you might find that you want to.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.840
My arm is better.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.280
I can walk again.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.440
I wrote an entire book this weekend.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.840
It's terrible, but I did it.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.240
Just go to Maximumfun.org.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.640
Thank you, Ross and Carey.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.400
Ono, Ross, and Carey is just a podcast.

32:16.400 --> 32:17.120
It doesn't do anything.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.480
It's just sounds you listen to in your ears.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.360
All these people are made up.

32:19.360 --> 32:19.920
Goodbye.

32:19.920 --> 32:33.360
Really crank it, go.

32:33.360 --> 32:33.600
Okay.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.160
Losing me.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.480
I want to munch.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.080
I want to munch.

32:44.080 --> 32:51.040
That felt cathartic for all three of us.

32:52.240 --> 32:55.280
Like we're all really working some shit out in that Munch Squad intro.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.160
Welcome to Munch Squad.

32:58.160 --> 33:03.200
It's a podcast within a podcast that features the latest and greatest in brand eating.

33:03.200 --> 33:08.080
I am very hungry, which I hate doing during the Munch Squad, because it makes me feel

33:08.880 --> 33:10.800
like I want to eat the things we talk about.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.480
It's a very dangerous place to be in.

33:12.480 --> 33:17.440
I want to thank Nathaniel, because we got a Munch Squad retro.

33:17.440 --> 33:24.960
We're going to hop in the DeLorean, if you will, and drive all the way back to 2001.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.600
A great year for wine.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.880
A great year for wine, 2001, March 20th.

33:31.680 --> 33:36.560
Those halcyon days of the beginning of the millennium.

33:36.560 --> 33:48.000
Taco Bell is offering a free taco to everyone in the United States if the core of the Mir

33:48.000 --> 33:52.640
Space Station hits a floating Taco Bell target placed in the South Pacific.

33:53.360 --> 33:53.680
What?

33:56.000 --> 34:02.720
Taco Bell is offering a free taco, you're with me so far, to everyone in the US if the

34:02.720 --> 34:07.600
core of the Mir Space Station hits a floating Taco Bell target placed in the South Pacific.

34:08.160 --> 34:08.880
Huh.

34:08.880 --> 34:09.680
Was that?

34:09.680 --> 34:10.240
Okay.

34:10.240 --> 34:15.920
I guess the context that I'm missing here is, was that something good?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
Did they like that that happened?

34:19.200 --> 34:23.840
Like did people want the core of the- or was this like a conciliatory like,

34:23.840 --> 34:27.360
listen, well, I'll be bummed out if the core of the Mir Space Station falls.

34:27.360 --> 34:34.400
But on the upside, if it hits the Taco Bell target, free tacos.

34:34.400 --> 34:39.840
There are 80 brave astronauts serving aboard the Mir Space Station right now, and that

34:39.840 --> 34:40.640
sucks.

34:40.640 --> 34:43.200
We hate what's about to happen to them.

34:45.760 --> 34:52.480
But on the other hand, now I think it was a planned fall, but that does raise a question

34:52.480 --> 35:00.240
before I get further and press release, the question that I have is, if we didn't know

35:00.240 --> 35:06.480
it was going to land on this Taco Bell target, does that mean we didn't know where it was

35:06.480 --> 35:07.280
going to land?

35:07.280 --> 35:09.280
I think that's exactly it, J-Man.

35:09.280 --> 35:12.800
I mean, that is either, either option is wild.

35:12.800 --> 35:17.120
Either Taco Bell knew exactly where the Mir Space Station was going to land to build a

35:17.120 --> 35:23.360
taco target there, or that no one knew and Taco Bell's like, well, if we aren't all

35:23.360 --> 35:34.720
eradicated, if fucking Delaware isn't blown off the map, the good news will be free tacos

35:34.720 --> 35:35.040
for everyone.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.840
All remaining states get a taco party.

35:39.520 --> 35:43.040
It encompasses all of human experience, right?

35:43.040 --> 35:51.520
At one end of the scale, the Mir satellite crashes into Las Cruces and wipes out millions.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.160
On the other end of the scale, hey, free tacos.

35:54.160 --> 35:58.160
Do they clarify somewhere on the press release how big the target is?

35:59.280 --> 36:05.280
Yes, I'm going to move on to literally the second paragraph of this wild, wild press

36:05.280 --> 36:05.920
release.

36:05.920 --> 36:11.760
Later this week, all eyes will be fixed on the sky in anticipation of the 150 ton space

36:11.760 --> 36:13.920
station's return to Earth.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.080
Taco Bell has created a 40 by 40 foot target.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.000
Oh, that seems fucking fair.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.800
The Pacific Ocean's only 63 million square miles, so that seems about fair.

36:26.000 --> 36:33.360
It's a 40 by 40 foot target painted with a bell bull's eye and bold purple letters stating

36:33.360 --> 36:34.640
free taco here.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.640
Thank God so the core can see it.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.600
Yeah, so they can see it.

36:39.600 --> 36:40.640
Huh, what's that?

36:40.640 --> 36:41.680
I'm going to crash into that.

36:42.480 --> 36:48.320
I've been in space for decades, but I still love humans enough to give them free tacos.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.080
I care about this.

36:50.720 --> 36:55.280
The floating target will be placed in the South Pacific Ocean off the coast of Australia

36:55.280 --> 36:56.720
in advance of Mir's descent.

36:57.440 --> 37:02.080
Taco Bell is capturing the imagination of millions of people as they eagerly await Mir's

37:02.080 --> 37:06.960
return to Earth, said Chris Becker, a fucking optimist if I've ever seen one.

37:06.960 --> 37:12.880
And also the vice president of brand communications, if Mir rings our bell, we'll offer a free

37:12.880 --> 37:14.640
taco to everyone in the US.

37:14.640 --> 37:19.200
It should be noted that the NASA is asking us not to do this.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.240
Don't do this.

37:20.240 --> 37:26.320
They have said, quote, if the core impacts anything, it could start a nuclear winter.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.720
But hey, we think it's worth it.

37:28.720 --> 37:34.320
They're also embarrassed that their bad spaceship broke and they don't want people to pay

37:34.320 --> 37:35.360
attention to that.

37:35.360 --> 37:40.400
Oh, my God.

37:41.280 --> 37:44.880
If Mir rings our bell, we'll offer a free taco to everyone in the US.

37:44.880 --> 37:49.440
First off, you know that it's a good statement if half of your quote is just repeating the

37:49.440 --> 37:50.880
thing that we all understand.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.120
Chris Becker then continues.

37:53.680 --> 38:01.600
If the core of Mir hits the designated Taco Bell target upon its reentry, every person

38:01.600 --> 38:09.280
in the United States will have an opportunity to obtain a coupon for a free taco valid at

38:09.280 --> 38:11.280
participating Taco Bell restaurants.

38:11.280 --> 38:17.680
By the way, if you're if you're Taco Bell franchise and you say I'm not doing that dumb

38:17.680 --> 38:22.400
space satellite promotion, you don't deserve the name Taco Bell.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.480
You should be stripped of your badge.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.760
You don't get the spirit of the brand.

38:27.760 --> 38:33.760
Coupon distribution, redemption and offer details will be made available to consumers

38:33.760 --> 38:38.320
on the Taco Bell website and in press materials should this event occur.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.240
So there's no fucking way.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.560
I guarantee they did not even have a contingency for if this actually occurred.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.800
Yeah, these these websites were not drawn up.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.160
Holy shit, though, if only they had been.

38:50.160 --> 38:56.240
I imagine they would be some Space Jam Geocities level internet events.

38:56.240 --> 39:02.480
The good news is that Taco Bell has purchased an insurance policy to cover the anticipated

39:02.480 --> 39:07.600
cost of the free taco redemption should the core of Mir hit the target.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.640
You know, it's funny.

39:10.400 --> 39:16.000
I now know because of the benefit of hindsight what the next 20 years had in store for all

39:16.000 --> 39:24.320
of us, and I can think of many better insurance policies Taco Bell could have taken out then

39:24.320 --> 39:29.440
insurance policy if the Mir space satellite hits our dumb ocean target.

39:29.440 --> 39:36.080
So just to be clear, they went, man, 2001 was really a different time, huh?

39:36.080 --> 39:43.360
They walked into an office somewhere and said, we are voluntarily offering a promotion that

39:43.360 --> 39:50.240
could cost us millions of dollars and we need you to cover that in case that happens.

39:50.240 --> 39:52.080
And someone said, you've got it.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.240
And someone said, you've got it.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.280
Sounds great.

39:55.280 --> 39:58.240
The fucking fix was in from the start.

39:58.240 --> 40:02.880
I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but like I know that whoever was controlling

40:02.880 --> 40:07.040
Mir got a little text from from, you know, Mr.

40:07.040 --> 40:13.840
Taco Bell and was like, hey, we need you to aim pretty far afield from this target because

40:13.840 --> 40:19.760
we will be fucking ruined if this if this smacks it, we will be in so much trouble and

40:19.760 --> 40:22.320
there will be no more tacos and it'll be on your hands.

40:22.320 --> 40:28.160
I want you guys to know, I am now Googling, did Mir Space Station hit the Taco Bell target?

40:28.160 --> 40:29.120
Justin Taleb, quick.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.480
I mean, I have no idea, but no.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.680
But almost certainly not.

40:36.000 --> 40:43.440
Okay, it did miss, but it says it missed by six inches.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.080
Oh, man.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.280
No, it probably missed by a million bajillion miles.

40:47.280 --> 40:47.920
Oh, yeah, definitely.

40:47.920 --> 40:51.440
I mean, it didn't say how much it missed by, but I wanted to make it seem interesting.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.360
Oh, it was so close.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.280
It was so close, you guys.

40:55.280 --> 41:00.560
Like a bird, a seagull landed on it and scooted it just out of the way.

41:00.560 --> 41:05.200
A big piece was heading right for it and a big bird flew in the way and got exploded

41:05.200 --> 41:07.440
and it made the shrapnel disappear.

41:07.440 --> 41:07.920
Damn it.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.240
But luckily, Solly got him back.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.760
Solly fixed it for us.

41:11.760 --> 41:15.600
Solly was so pissed that those birds took away our free tacos.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.200
He took those birds out.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.160
Good work, Solly.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.840
I need just a second.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.240
Can you guys give me just a second to run some quick math?

41:22.240 --> 41:22.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.240
Yeah, good.

41:24.240 --> 41:24.720
Thank you.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.480
Just give me a second to run some math.

41:26.480 --> 41:30.720
I'll put some cool math sound effects on here.

41:30.720 --> 41:35.280
Yeah, if you would just let me run some math.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.040
I'll just play a clip from Swordfish.

41:37.680 --> 41:38.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.080
Maybe something like a ticker.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.680
Like you're hitting keys, you know?

41:45.680 --> 41:47.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.640
Just be quiet.

41:49.360 --> 41:50.560
Or you're doing it in your head.

41:51.840 --> 41:52.720
No, no, no.

41:52.720 --> 41:53.680
I mean, then I don't.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.720
Why do I need to be quiet?

41:56.080 --> 41:57.920
No, I mean, you don't need to be quiet.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.800
I'm just like, I'm trying to get a fix on something.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.400
Okay, so right.

42:04.400 --> 42:09.280
Okay, so the, okay, now I understand.

42:09.280 --> 42:18.320
And so the target was placed in the South Pacific Ocean, right?

42:19.040 --> 42:20.800
And I'm looking at a follow up here.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.760
The QSR chain set up a floating target,

42:23.760 --> 42:25.040
carrying the company logo in the phrase,

42:25.040 --> 42:29.040
few targets here, about 10 miles off the coast of Australia.

42:31.440 --> 42:35.600
But Mir landed off course near Chile.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.320
That sucks.

42:36.880 --> 42:37.600
Oh, wow.

42:37.600 --> 42:38.880
That sucks.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.560
Fucking look at a map right now.

42:41.520 --> 42:42.880
It fucking sucks.

42:43.440 --> 42:43.940
Sucks.

42:44.800 --> 42:48.800
Either, okay, there's two possible scenarios.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.760
Either Taco Bell is an incredibly unscrupulous company,

42:53.760 --> 42:58.160
or we all came fucking super duper duper close

42:58.160 --> 42:59.840
to a very un-chilled day.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.880
That's like half the planet.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.480
It's half the planet away.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.360
It's a hemisphere.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.280
It's like half a planet away.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.120
You fucked up so bad, Mir.

43:10.160 --> 43:10.960
Oh my God.

43:10.960 --> 43:11.520
Oh, wow.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.400
It's like way far away.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.760
It's pretty far away.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.600
I mean, okay, can I say this?

43:17.600 --> 43:19.360
Even in the grand scheme of things, Taco Bell,

43:19.920 --> 43:22.240
10 miles off the coast of Australia,

43:22.240 --> 43:25.040
you were kind of betting against Australia there, right?

43:25.040 --> 43:26.720
Like, yeah.

43:27.680 --> 43:30.800
It's not like you went dead center of the ocean or anything.

43:30.800 --> 43:31.120
No.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.800
You were like, I don't know,

43:32.800 --> 43:35.200
strong breeze and we lose Brisbane, you know?

43:35.200 --> 43:38.480
Yeah, the promotion says,

43:38.480 --> 43:40.960
we'll give a free taco to everybody in America.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.320
And sure, Australia too.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.040
Why not?

43:43.040 --> 43:44.560
That's not going to cost us anything.

43:46.320 --> 43:46.960
Fuck.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.160
It's 10 miles.

43:48.160 --> 43:48.640
It's so close.

43:48.640 --> 43:49.760
That's such a great point.

43:52.880 --> 43:56.160
The real victory there would not be free tacos for America.

43:56.160 --> 43:59.440
It would be the continued existence of Australia.

43:59.440 --> 44:03.600
That's the equivalent of in a comet's going to hit the earth

44:03.600 --> 44:06.080
and like it just barely misses earth

44:06.080 --> 44:09.120
because at the last minute Bruce Willis set off the bomb.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.240
That's what we're looking at.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.680
That's that kind of scrape.

44:13.120 --> 44:14.400
Australia was probably like,

44:14.400 --> 44:17.120
oh, thank God you guys don't get tacos.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.960
I feel bad for the family in Chile

44:18.960 --> 44:22.320
whose little five-year-old son was like,

44:22.320 --> 44:24.720
Papa, I'm scared that the Mir space station

44:24.720 --> 44:25.840
is going to crash on us.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.280
And the dad has to say like,

44:27.280 --> 44:29.360
oh, don't worry, Taco Bell put the target

44:29.360 --> 44:30.640
a whole hemisphere away.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.200
We have nothing to worry about.

44:33.200 --> 44:36.640
The Taco Bell scientists have spent years.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.280
The Taco Bell mathematicians have done their work on this

44:39.280 --> 44:40.240
and they've done a great job.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.800
Son, you have nothing to worry about.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.040
No problem at all.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.640
No issues here.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.160
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

44:48.880 --> 44:49.120
Sure.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.000
Yeah, I love that.

44:50.000 --> 44:50.800
This one's a trip.

44:50.800 --> 44:53.120
It was sent in by Graham Robot.

44:53.120 --> 44:53.520
Thank you.

44:53.520 --> 44:56.960
It's a Yahoo answers user, Sean, who asks,

44:57.840 --> 45:00.080
how to get back at my jerk coworker.

45:00.640 --> 45:01.360
Yeah.

45:01.360 --> 45:06.240
Familiar premise, every time we are in Zoom meetings,

45:06.240 --> 45:07.520
so this is the during times,

45:08.320 --> 45:11.200
and I start waxing philosophical about our business,

45:11.760 --> 45:13.760
we sell tires, by the way,

45:13.760 --> 45:16.480
he refuses to engage and just says something sarcastic

45:16.480 --> 45:19.440
like, okay, Play-Doh, and everyone laughs,

45:19.440 --> 45:22.480
just laughs, their ugly yellow teeth

45:22.480 --> 45:25.120
showing like the rotten top of an old fence.

45:25.760 --> 45:26.400
Oh boy.

45:27.040 --> 45:29.840
I try to insist that what I was saying had some value

45:29.840 --> 45:32.000
and then my boss tries to placate me, right?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.720
He says, oh, you know we love you, Sean,

45:34.720 --> 45:35.920
and he tries to move on,

45:36.480 --> 45:40.160
but I sit there and seethe every single time

45:40.160 --> 45:43.920
watching these robots rattle off facts and figures.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.560
I feel like I never have the perfect retort,

45:46.560 --> 45:48.880
no matter how much I try to write it out beforehand,

45:48.880 --> 45:50.960
it's never ready for primetime.

45:50.960 --> 45:53.440
Does anybody have a good one I can use?

45:53.440 --> 45:56.960
Drop your Venmo and I'll pay you for it.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.920
Wow, that's generous.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.000
I do like to picture this scene

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
of someone who's just dunked on Sean real hard

46:04.000 --> 46:08.320
and you just hear, all right, what have I got here?

46:11.200 --> 46:12.400
Same on you, pal.

46:13.520 --> 46:15.040
Pretty good, $5 there.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.360
Sean sounds like a real cool dude to work with.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.840
Sean sounds like a real piece of work,

46:21.840 --> 46:24.480
but I mean, every tire store's got one.

46:24.480 --> 46:29.120
That old chestnut.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.760
And I get it, they sell tires,

46:31.760 --> 46:35.920
but that doesn't mean they have to just sell tires.

46:35.920 --> 46:36.960
No, if you think about it,

46:36.960 --> 46:38.640
the way that the wheel turns

46:39.520 --> 46:42.640
is kind of like the way that time is a flat circle.

46:42.640 --> 46:46.640
And when we sell a family a tire,

46:46.640 --> 46:49.680
what we're really doing is giving them security

46:49.680 --> 46:52.640
that their car won't just scrape along the road

46:52.640 --> 46:55.760
and make a terrible noise and sparks and stuff, you know?

46:55.760 --> 46:58.080
And the stinky car smell of that rubber.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.280
And the stinky car smell,

46:59.280 --> 47:01.040
and that's really what it's all about, you know?

47:01.040 --> 47:02.480
So it's like, okay, Plato.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.280
Fuck you.

47:08.880 --> 47:10.320
Okay, Plato's pretty choice.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.800
And I don't know, if I was ever working on a job

47:14.800 --> 47:16.720
and tried to stick up for myself and my boss said,

47:16.720 --> 47:18.400
oh, you know we love you, Griffin,

47:18.400 --> 47:23.040
I would probably have to leave that particular job.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.040
Because that falls under the category of things

47:25.040 --> 47:26.400
that someone says when you know

47:26.400 --> 47:28.640
that they mean the exact opposite of that thing.

47:29.360 --> 47:31.200
Because no one has ever had to say to someone,

47:31.200 --> 47:33.520
you know we love you, and had the other person go,

47:33.520 --> 47:35.360
yes, I do know that you do.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.640
It would drive me wild though,

47:36.640 --> 47:38.720
sitting in one of these meetings when somebody's like,

47:38.720 --> 47:41.280
these tires, we should sell them for $50.

47:42.560 --> 47:46.240
Oh, snooze, you know what I mean?

47:46.240 --> 47:49.120
Like, why though?

47:49.120 --> 47:51.600
Are we even still selling tires?

47:52.400 --> 47:55.360
Is it possible that Sean works with actual robots,

47:55.360 --> 47:57.680
like the robots that take tires off of cars

47:57.680 --> 47:58.720
and put new ones on?

47:58.720 --> 48:00.880
I see him in the Ford commercials sometimes,

48:00.880 --> 48:02.160
making sparks and everything.

48:02.160 --> 48:04.080
What if Sean works with those and he makes a joke

48:04.080 --> 48:05.520
and they're like, okay, Plato.

48:06.320 --> 48:07.360
He's like, goddammit.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.040
They literally cannot understand the concept

48:11.040 --> 48:14.880
of the platonic ideal of a wheel.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.640
Yeah, he has been trying to like,

48:16.640 --> 48:20.640
not just, they understand the mechanics of tires.

48:20.640 --> 48:23.440
He's trying to elevate them to a new level

48:23.440 --> 48:25.680
of understanding the spirituality of it.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.960
But they're robots, you know,

48:26.960 --> 48:28.400
they have a hard time dealing

48:28.400 --> 48:31.120
with those kind of ethereal concepts.

48:31.120 --> 48:33.680
And so because they're embarrassed by their inability

48:33.680 --> 48:37.040
to grasp these concepts, they have to put him down.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.400
Right, like they're robots,

48:38.400 --> 48:40.800
they know about the allegory of the cave,

48:40.800 --> 48:42.880
but they can't possibly conceive

48:42.880 --> 48:45.200
of how it relates to selling

48:45.200 --> 48:47.680
these incredible Firestone tires.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.640
Exactly.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.400
It would be hard to get a leg up on them

48:50.400 --> 48:52.400
because they would just search the cloud.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.160
I'm searching the cloud for the best way

48:54.160 --> 48:55.360
to tear you down.

48:55.360 --> 48:56.960
One second, processing.

48:58.320 --> 49:00.080
Here is a picture of your ex-girlfriend.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.720
Oh, you got me.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.240
That was very painful.

49:04.240 --> 49:05.280
But also very good.

49:05.280 --> 49:10.320
I had to Venmo a stranger.

49:13.520 --> 49:17.040
You send the Venmo for a great bird

49:17.040 --> 49:19.280
and then one of the robots dings.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.280
That was me, I created that.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.480
You just bought one of my insults.

49:24.480 --> 49:25.840
This question's hot off the presses.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.200
This is from two days ago.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.040
And a commenter responded,

49:29.040 --> 49:32.000
ignore him and sell more tires than he does.

49:32.000 --> 49:32.640
Fucking great.

49:32.640 --> 49:35.360
You would think that's ironclad,

49:35.360 --> 49:37.280
but Sean responded pretty much right away.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.240
Yeah, I thought about that,

49:38.240 --> 49:39.840
but then he'll say something like,

49:39.840 --> 49:41.120
nice sales, Loman.

49:41.120 --> 49:43.440
So now we do know this gentleman's entire name.

49:44.960 --> 49:45.760
No, hold on.

49:45.760 --> 49:48.480
No-man is about, that's lovely Loman.

49:48.480 --> 49:49.040
It's worse.

49:50.240 --> 49:53.280
This person just made a hilarious death of a salesman.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.800
About themself too.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.360
Hey, Sean sounds like a real treat to work with.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.200
He'll say something like,

49:59.200 --> 50:00.240
nice sales, Loman,

50:00.240 --> 50:02.160
and then he'll have the place in Stitches.

50:02.160 --> 50:03.840
That bastard always wins.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.600
If you fucking,

50:05.600 --> 50:08.240
if you can drop an Arthur Miller reference

50:08.240 --> 50:10.560
and make him bus up your whole office,

50:10.560 --> 50:13.360
that's a cool place to work in Sean's The Problem.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.200
Oh, hold on.

50:15.200 --> 50:16.560
There's no doubt in anyone's mind

50:16.560 --> 50:17.920
Sean's The Problem here, yes?

50:19.200 --> 50:20.400
No, we can all agree.

50:20.400 --> 50:20.720
Okay.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.800
We all feel pretty confident that Sean's The Problem.

50:24.720 --> 50:26.240
Good sales, Loman.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.400
Good sales.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.840
Way to do your job, idiot.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.280
What a weird, ironic insult of like,

50:33.280 --> 50:35.200
but I did sell a lot of tires.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.520
I was successful at my job.

50:37.520 --> 50:38.640
I'm employee of the month.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.400
Yeah, good work, Loman.

50:40.400 --> 50:40.880
No, but-

50:40.880 --> 50:41.600
Yeah, nice.

50:41.600 --> 50:42.800
No, but he's,

50:42.800 --> 50:44.800
the whole thing is his experience is that

50:44.800 --> 50:47.440
he no longer sees himself as useful in the world

50:47.440 --> 50:50.720
and he is no longer an effective salesman.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.520
Yeah, whatever.

50:51.520 --> 50:52.240
Yeah, whatever.

50:52.240 --> 50:52.960
Arthur Miller.

50:53.520 --> 50:54.880
No, but Arthur Miller did right.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.160
Now they would,

50:58.160 --> 51:00.480
they would ditch this zero,

51:01.760 --> 51:06.240
but he does lay the huge eggs that the tires come out of.

51:06.240 --> 51:06.880
Yep.

51:06.880 --> 51:11.040
And it's just the clearance that they get on those

51:11.040 --> 51:12.960
is just out of this world.

51:12.960 --> 51:13.440
Yep.

51:13.440 --> 51:16.000
Out of his huge ass.

51:16.000 --> 51:16.640
Oh, sorry.

51:16.640 --> 51:17.200
Yeah, go ahead.

51:17.760 --> 51:19.520
No, Griffin, tell me more about the eggs

51:19.520 --> 51:20.960
that come out of this human man.

51:20.960 --> 51:23.280
He's got a big butt and the eggs come out of them

51:23.280 --> 51:24.640
and then when they hatch,

51:24.640 --> 51:26.480
that's where they get the tires that they sell.

51:26.480 --> 51:27.520
So it's just pure profit.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.720
It's pure profit.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.760
Oh, I see, okay.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.520
No one else lays the tire eggs.

51:31.520 --> 51:31.760
No, that's true.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.000
So they have to keep Sean around.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.680
Another thing about Max Fun Drive this year

51:37.680 --> 51:39.360
that I want to tell you all about,

51:39.360 --> 51:41.360
if you are already a member

51:41.360 --> 51:43.920
and you have maybe a friend or a loved one

51:43.920 --> 51:45.360
or a family member or something

51:45.360 --> 51:47.520
who would love all that bonus content,

51:47.520 --> 51:48.560
love all those gifts,

51:48.560 --> 51:50.640
but they are not able to become a member,

51:50.640 --> 51:53.920
this year you can also gift donations to them.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.960
We're just so grateful to everybody who has supported us

51:56.960 --> 51:59.920
and everybody who not just gives financially,

51:59.920 --> 52:01.280
but listens to the shows,

52:02.160 --> 52:04.960
tells their friends about it, everything.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.400
Like seeing people tweet

52:06.400 --> 52:08.160
about how much episodes mean to them

52:08.160 --> 52:10.000
or that something cracked them up.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.600
Like knowing that we are able to make people smile

52:13.600 --> 52:16.480
from time to time during really, really scary times,

52:16.480 --> 52:17.680
that means a lot to us.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.320
And knowing that it matters enough that,

52:20.320 --> 52:21.920
you know, if you can,

52:21.920 --> 52:24.160
you make the decision to support our shows

52:24.160 --> 52:25.120
means a lot to us.

52:25.120 --> 52:27.040
So thank you to everybody

52:27.040 --> 52:28.400
and thank you just for listening.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.160
So if you are not a member

52:30.160 --> 52:32.560
or if you want to boost your membership

52:32.560 --> 52:35.920
or if you want to give a membership to somebody else,

52:35.920 --> 52:39.760
you can go to maximumfun.org slash join

52:39.760 --> 52:41.680
and check out all the information there.

52:41.680 --> 52:43.040
When someone boosts their donation,

52:43.040 --> 52:44.800
can we call it hitting the nos?

52:44.800 --> 52:46.400
I think that's probably okay.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.000
Punch the nos.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.640
Yeah.

52:48.640 --> 52:51.680
And punch the nos on your MP3 player

52:51.680 --> 52:53.760
as you listen to It's a Departure

52:53.760 --> 52:55.760
off the album Putting the Days to Bed by the Long Winters,

52:55.760 --> 52:58.320
who have graciously allowed us to use the song Thank You.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.560
And not gonna make Max Fun again,

53:00.560 --> 53:03.360
they've gotten their fill.

53:03.360 --> 53:04.400
Their pound of flesh.

53:06.240 --> 53:09.760
And we have a new graphic novel out this week.

53:09.760 --> 53:10.480
Is it this week?

53:10.480 --> 53:10.980
Yeah.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.800
Fuck.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.560
Anyway, go to theadventurezonecomic.com,

53:14.560 --> 53:15.200
it's real good.

53:15.760 --> 53:16.640
Oh, speaking of,

53:16.640 --> 53:19.200
we're doing a book event for the Adventure Zone comic

53:19.200 --> 53:19.920
on the 17th.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.480
It's gonna be on our YouTube channel.

53:22.480 --> 53:24.160
We'll tweet all the updates and stuff

53:24.160 --> 53:26.720
on the McRoy family Twitter account,

53:27.360 --> 53:28.720
but it's gonna be really fun.

53:28.720 --> 53:29.840
It's gonna be great.

53:31.440 --> 53:32.480
So y'all want the final?

53:33.840 --> 53:34.960
Final Yahoo.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.560
This one was sent in by Hattrick.

53:36.560 --> 53:38.480
Graham Roebuck crushed it.

53:38.480 --> 53:39.200
Thank you, Graham.

53:39.200 --> 53:41.760
It's Yahoo Answers user Josh, who asks,

53:43.600 --> 53:46.160
how do I get pickle smell off body quick?

53:50.400 --> 53:51.680
I'm gonna read the next.

53:51.680 --> 53:53.840
My mom can't know I've been eating her pickles.

53:53.840 --> 53:54.800
She gets off work soon,

53:54.800 --> 53:56.560
and she's gonna smell them unless I get it off.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.240
Tried shower, still stinks.

54:00.800 --> 54:02.000
Update, update.

54:03.040 --> 54:03.600
She knows.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.760
My name is Justin McRoy.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.160
I'm Griffin McRoy.

54:14.160 --> 54:15.520
This has been my brother, my brother and me.
