WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
It's better, it's better with you

00:54.020 --> 00:56.020
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
It's better, it's better with you

01:02.300 --> 01:09.300
It's better, it's better with you

01:11.020 --> 01:16.220
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Layla

01:17.420 --> 01:25.940
No, it's me Justin. It's Justin. Okay. I'm your middle his brother Travis big dog woof woof Layla. Oh my god

01:25.940 --> 01:31.740
This is Griffin to go behind the bit somebody was like

01:32.140 --> 01:37.580
Hey, let's do an intro about Eric Clapton and I without knowing like like, okay

01:37.580 --> 01:39.580
I guess the man's written quite a few songs

01:42.860 --> 01:46.660
I was like, yeah, sure. Let's Clapton it up, baby

01:46.660 --> 01:51.620
And then I it while my brothers were introducing themselves. I did Google the gentleman's name

01:51.620 --> 01:54.020
I did find out that he has released I would say

01:54.020 --> 02:01.660
Uh, let's see the independent calls it a controversial new anti-lockdown anthem. This has got to stop. That sounds fucking good

02:02.580 --> 02:04.580
Huh?

02:04.740 --> 02:10.580
Enough is enough. I can't take this be yes any longer. It's gone

02:12.060 --> 02:17.700
Don't wanna claim my soul you'll have to come and break down this door. I

02:19.020 --> 02:21.780
Knew that something was going on wrong

02:21.780 --> 02:23.780
when you started

02:26.580 --> 02:31.300
I can't move my hands. I break out in sweat. I'm gonna cry

02:34.220 --> 02:41.860
Okay, it's the most sort of like listen here's the thing we don't know exactly what we're upset about but we know we're upset about

02:41.860 --> 02:46.420
Yeah, I'm gonna break down in tears cuz I can't take off my mask

02:46.420 --> 02:52.060
Well the whole time I'm at the California pizza kitchen. This song sucks shit

02:53.460 --> 02:56.900
You're protesting that someone asked you to just like chill at home

02:57.460 --> 03:01.300
Like I'm mad that cuz they won't come to all my great Eric

03:02.940 --> 03:05.460
This is like if during like the blitzkrieg

03:05.860 --> 03:12.480
Someone in in London have been like it's bullshit that they're making a stay inside and like hey, that's not the problem

03:12.480 --> 03:20.200
You know that that that is a solution to a bigger problem, right? You know that right? Oh

03:20.680 --> 03:25.640
My god, he just he's so wild. He sucked for a long time

03:25.640 --> 03:30.200
This is not new by the way, Eric Clapton has suffered quite quite some time

03:32.080 --> 03:34.080
Yeah, he had a

03:34.080 --> 03:39.760
He's got a new song out cuz enough's enough with this covered stuff and I you know what I'm that front

03:39.760 --> 03:43.200
Yeah, I'm with I think we can all get behind

03:43.880 --> 03:49.840
Him on that thing because if it had been like can we just yeah, can we just move?

03:50.240 --> 03:52.240
Can we just get it?

03:52.280 --> 03:56.640
Hey COVID sucks and we need to do whatever we need to do to stop it

03:56.720 --> 04:02.480
But instead it's like COVID sucks, but also I miss breathing on people

04:02.480 --> 04:10.800
I love that special Eric Clapton way I breathe. If I don't breathe on people I can't feel alive. This is BS you guys

04:10.800 --> 04:17.960
I love to breathe on people and if I can't if I can't huff other people's breath. Am I even Eric Clapton anymore?

04:17.960 --> 04:45.960
Oh my god, Eric Clapton, what a weird like and one last thing. Man I love all, I love 100% of Eric Clapton's shit without fail. Thanks to everybody who's enjoyed my whole thing over the many many years. Now just if I can just say one quick thing.

04:47.960 --> 05:04.760
I know, I know what you're thinking. Is this gonna be a song about how I look like the guy who vented Atari and everybody in my band looks like that guy too and the answer is no. It's gonna be a whole, it's gonna be a whole fucking anti-COVID like protection thing.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.200
We're all anti-COVID, we're all anti-COVID, Eric.

05:08.200 --> 05:16.920
I just hope that this leads to a bunch of like controversial but very like maybe Billy Joel will release a song called Remember When We Used to Smoke on Planes

05:16.920 --> 05:24.440
and it'll just be about like how much Billy Joel hates and he doesn't even smoke but he thinks it's bullshit that other people can't, you know?

05:24.440 --> 05:43.960
This fucking dude last year, by which I mean Eric Clapton, did a track with Van Morrison that was called Stand and Deliver that was also about lockdown woes and part of me wonders if they actually got together to collab on that track

05:43.960 --> 05:58.520
or if these two fucking dinguses wrote two separate anti-COVID lockdown songs that they just realized, hey, if you play these at the same time, they fucking harmonize because we're both fucking smooth brain Jasmine idiots.

05:58.520 --> 06:17.160
Eric Clapton's song should have been released and the whole thing was just about like, I wish I had some hobbies besides huffing other people's breath and standing on a stage. Does anyone know how to knit? Could you teach me about sourdough? Cause I'm bored as shit.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.600
You guys wanna hear some of the comments?

06:18.600 --> 06:19.080
Yeah.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.200
Yeah, I would love to.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.800
They say to always do the comments.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.440
Wait, on what platform are you reading these comments?

06:24.440 --> 06:25.160
YouTube.

06:25.160 --> 06:25.960
Okay.

06:25.960 --> 06:37.080
On his official video. These are people that have wandered into the fucking, like, you don't think they sought it out, Justin? You think they just stumbled into Eric Clapton's anti-lockdown song?

06:37.080 --> 06:40.920
I mean, I found it somehow. This is not important. Here's the important thing.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.160
Thanks, Eric. Great job.

06:43.160 --> 06:43.960
Awesome.

06:43.960 --> 06:48.280
Excellent song and brave message. Nice energy and bounce to it.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.960
This one's good. This one's your fucking, this one bounces.

06:51.960 --> 06:52.760
This one's kind of bounce.

06:52.760 --> 07:00.120
Oh, I could grind on the dance floor to this song Enough's Enough about this COVID stuff. Also, bold message, is it?

07:00.120 --> 07:04.040
It's just a bold message. Congratulations on your attitude.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.000
That sounds sarcastic.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Congratulations on your attitude?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.400
Congratulations on your good attitude.

07:09.400 --> 07:18.920
That sounds like something a 12-year-old says in the heat of the moment when they can't think of, like, a good retort. And then it's just like, oh yeah, well, congratulations on your attitude.

07:18.920 --> 07:23.400
Here's one. It says, yes, new Clapton.

07:23.400 --> 07:28.120
Wow, this song was absolutely horrible in propaganda.

07:28.120 --> 07:38.120
I don't know if they were typing that, like, as they were listening to it, like, yes, yes, a new joint, a new joint from Eric Clapton.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.680
Okay, these comments are so, hey, Pfizer, do you listen?

07:42.680 --> 07:44.120
What?

07:44.120 --> 07:48.920
Hey, Pfizer, do you listen, I guess, to this song, to Eric Clapton?

07:48.920 --> 07:53.720
Hi, my name's Jeremy Pfizer, and oh shit, yeah, the Jazz Man's got a new track out.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.480
Let me just pipe right in.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.360
Oh, shit.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.760
Hey, guys, you gotta come listen to this.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.320
Have we fucked up pretty bad?

08:01.320 --> 08:05.960
Now, here's the interesting, apparently, I've not watched the full video for the song.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.920
The video also includes, like, imagery of a world on fire.

08:08.920 --> 08:17.320
And so it's, like, anti-lockdown, but also pro, like, environmental reforms mixed messages.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.080
Fuck yeah, let's get into this now.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.160
Fuck yeah, this is a gift that keeps on giving.

08:21.160 --> 08:29.240
New Yorker did do a send up, a little political cartoon by Barry Blitt called Eric Clapton, enough is enough.

08:29.240 --> 08:33.240
And the subtitle says, the listening party for Eric Clapton's new protest song.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.640
And it's an unflattering image of Mr. Clapton.

08:35.640 --> 08:41.240
And then you got, let's see, Jim Jordan and Louie Gomer in kiss makeup.

08:41.240 --> 08:46.840
You got Daffy Duck, a Brachiosaurus, Van Morrison, Goofy, Bozo, and several Iguanodons.

08:46.840 --> 08:50.760
Oh, got him again.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.480
End of joke.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.440
What's that?

08:52.440 --> 08:56.920
Okay, Goofy is a fucking emblem of an idiot.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.920
Bozo, a clown, right?

08:58.920 --> 09:02.120
Van Morrison, we have covered my feelings about this gentleman.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.800
What the fuck did Daffy Duck?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.080
What the fuck is Daffy?

09:05.080 --> 09:07.720
Is Daffy Duck notably anti-vax?

09:07.720 --> 09:12.200
No, if anything, Daffy Duck is the one I appreciate the most in the Mickey Mouse universe.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.840
Because he's the one to say like, this is dumb.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.240
Like Goofy will throw up some dumb bullshit.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.000
And Donald's like, no.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.600
And I have sympathy for Goofy because Goofy doesn't know.

09:22.600 --> 09:26.520
And Goofy gets on the internet and he sees somebody saying like, Bill Gates wants a microchip.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.560
And then you're like, okay, I've got an idea to read it.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.760
Let's hear about this.

09:30.760 --> 09:36.680
But Daffy Duck is fucking, Daffy's doesn't need to subscribe to that.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.480
No.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.520
And also, why bring the fucking Brachiosauruses into this?

09:40.520 --> 09:41.560
What did they do?

09:41.560 --> 09:42.200
For real.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.000
They had a rough go of it.

09:43.000 --> 09:43.960
Let's let them.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.240
Several Iguanodons.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.160
I get that.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.360
Those fuckers.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.240
Yeah, that tracks.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.800
Ugh, Iguanodons.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.360
I feel like I should, this has felt venty.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.600
No, it's fine.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.040
This feels venty.

09:58.040 --> 09:58.600
I feel like we're-

09:58.600 --> 10:00.840
You feel like we're punching down at Eric Clapton?

10:01.640 --> 10:03.240
Well, no, I mean, no.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.560
I mean, no, it's like kind of sideways.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.440
I bet we're about-

10:09.560 --> 10:10.520
Finish it.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.160
I'm the guy that uploaded Barry's Included TikTok.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.000
I feel like I'm about equal to Eric Clapton at this point.

10:15.000 --> 10:15.880
Yeah, sure.

10:15.880 --> 10:16.200
Yeah.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.640
27,000 times that has been used.

10:19.640 --> 10:25.800
We're sitting next to them on the airplane and violently fighting over the armrest.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.240
Just very passive aggressive.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.920
That's us and Eric Clapton, for sure.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.520
For sure, for sure.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.040
And we're masked and he's not.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.160
It's important to note.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.720
The fucking gutless headlines of the people,

10:35.720 --> 10:37.640
except for the fucking New Yorker who came in and was like,

10:37.640 --> 10:39.480
look at this fucking doofus.

10:39.480 --> 10:40.440
He loves Daffy Duck.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.040
All the other ones are like,

10:43.640 --> 10:47.720
let's see, almost a guitar website,

10:48.600 --> 10:50.360
which is called guitar.com, I guess.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.600
Eric Clapton's new single, This Has Gotta Stop,

10:52.600 --> 10:55.080
seemingly voices his anti-vax sentiment.

10:55.080 --> 10:55.800
No fucking way.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.440
Does it?

10:56.440 --> 11:01.160
Daily news, Eric Clapton appears to criticize COVID restrictions in song.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.400
I don't want to put words in his mouth,

11:03.400 --> 11:04.440
but at the part where he's like,

11:04.440 --> 11:07.320
AstraZeneca, I don't trust you.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.680
It's like, I think-

11:08.680 --> 11:10.520
Like, let's talk about this for a second, Eric.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.280
Let's talk about your bad boy anthem here.

11:12.280 --> 11:12.840
Uh-huh.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.720
How this bad boy anthem where the third line is,

11:15.720 --> 11:17.880
I can't take this BS any longer.

11:17.880 --> 11:18.280
Yep.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.600
Aw, damn, dude, fucking zinged him.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.120
Did you say BS?

11:22.120 --> 11:22.600
Got him.

11:22.600 --> 11:26.040
I remember fucking when Dylan was like lighting shit up in the 60s,

11:26.040 --> 11:30.200
like, this BS from the government.

11:30.200 --> 11:34.200
These jerkoos have done enough with my privacy.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.640
I'm sick of all of this crap.

11:39.880 --> 11:40.520
And I'm like, not cool.

11:40.520 --> 11:44.120
Hey, everybody in the audience, if you're sick of this crap doo-doo,

11:45.080 --> 11:45.960
let me hear you.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.880
Put one hand in the air.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.880
It's like when Rage Against the Machine was like,

11:49.880 --> 11:52.760
hey, F you, I won't do what you tell me.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.320
You know what I mean?

11:53.320 --> 11:54.600
It's like, whoa, strong language there.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.120
Some of those that work forces are real stinkers.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.400
Are real pills.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.520
Like, Eric, what is happening to you?

12:05.160 --> 12:08.680
Like, because if, just like, I live in West Virginia

12:08.680 --> 12:11.320
and everything just seems to be progressing as normal here.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.400
I see no souls being claimed.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.080
Everybody's just kind of going rump-a-room on it over here in West Virginia.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.120
I don't know, man.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.400
I don't know what it's like over there.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.800
I don't know who's trying to steal your freedom.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.720
Because if you're talking about the freedom to, like, do concerts,

12:25.720 --> 12:28.760
well, on this one, Eric, I think that, you know,

12:29.320 --> 12:30.840
bud, it sucks.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.200
It sucks, don't it?

12:32.200 --> 12:35.080
It's pretty bad to keep wanting to do a show

12:35.080 --> 12:37.000
and it's not safe to do this show.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.600
I wish Eric had just called me to complain about it

12:40.600 --> 12:42.360
rather than having to do a song about it.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.080
Because nobody's taking your freedom, Eric.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.360
Do you think that the first draft of this song was like,

12:48.360 --> 12:50.280
it sucks that I don't get to do concerts,

12:50.280 --> 12:51.880
but I do understand.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.040
And then someone's like, I don't think that's bold enough, Eric.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.400
And he's like, oh, got it, got it, got it.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.680
Let me take another pass at it.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.720
This is BS.

12:58.840 --> 13:04.280
He doesn't even have the guts to, like, say what the song is about.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.280
Like, it's like, yeah.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.800
And it's the most limp, like, I just wish it...

13:11.800 --> 13:14.520
It's like, it's the passive voice protest song.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.120
It's like, be nice with stuff.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.280
Yeah, I'm sick of it or whatever.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.080
I'm not going to agree with what you're saying.

13:24.120 --> 13:28.120
It feels like something like that uncle would post on Facebook,

13:28.120 --> 13:31.240
but then not respond to any of the comments from people like,

13:31.240 --> 13:32.600
what do you, hey, what do you mean?

13:33.400 --> 13:36.280
Yeah, it would be like if instead of this song

13:36.280 --> 13:39.320
was titled Cocaine, if he had called it, like, silly stuff.

13:39.320 --> 13:45.720
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.360
Fun dust.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.480
Mr. Clapton, did you write a song about cocaine?

13:51.480 --> 13:51.800
What?

13:51.800 --> 13:53.800
No, it's called Fun Dust.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.680
It's different.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.240
Anything.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.480
Could be anything.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.720
Unspun cotton candy powder.

13:59.720 --> 14:04.520
It sounds like a cover of the song Cocaine that you did not write.

14:04.520 --> 14:08.440
Yeah, no, I know, but I switched it with Fun Dust so it could mean anything.

14:08.440 --> 14:13.080
Oh, it's getting a little war with grandpa you though,

14:13.080 --> 14:14.440
because we're at 16 minutes.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.480
Yeah, we got to wrap it up.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.160
Although ironically, we are currently at war with grandpa.

14:20.760 --> 14:25.720
To be fair, is there a way that this song, okay,

14:26.440 --> 14:30.040
is there a way that we can reclaim the song,

14:30.040 --> 14:33.480
this has got to stop, to make it about something else?

14:33.480 --> 14:36.360
Because it's so sort of empty and hollow.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.640
What is something that we can rage against with these?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.280
Let me look at the lyrics here.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.720
Yeah, just imagine the most boring, pointless set of it you can.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.200
Yeah, okay.

14:52.120 --> 14:52.920
Okay, yeah.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.280
This has got to stop, enough is enough.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.120
How about I just bought a top,

15:00.280 --> 15:03.480
I just bought a top and it fits really great.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.040
And it's just about a good shopping trip that he had.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.200
That would be a bolder stance, I think,

15:08.200 --> 15:09.880
than the one he's taking here.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.640
I don't think it's salvageable.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.600
Oh, I can't take this IBS anymore.

15:14.600 --> 15:19.160
And it's about finding, we have to find a cure for IBS.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.840
What do you do without changing the lyrics?

15:20.840 --> 15:22.520
We just decided it's about something else.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.160
Okay, wait.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.920
I can't take this video, it's gone far enough.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.840
You want to claim my soul, come break down the story.

15:27.720 --> 15:28.280
Yeah, okay.

15:28.280 --> 15:31.000
So this is about your friends are like,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.080
hey, you're watching too much NCIS.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.560
And you're like, I'll never watch enough NCIS.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.480
You'll have to come and break down this door

15:37.480 --> 15:40.280
if you want to take away NCIS from me.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.640
And that would be a bolder statement

15:41.640 --> 15:42.680
than what he's saying here.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.040
This is an advice show where we help people.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.320
And I fear that he may be beyond that point,

15:51.320 --> 15:54.920
beyond our powers, our considerable advice giving powers.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.280
Hello, brothers.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.720
Jacket hanging up at my work.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.280
I feel like you guys didn't respond to that.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.520
Yeah, it's an email.

16:03.320 --> 16:03.880
Okay.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.560
Hello, brothers.

16:05.560 --> 16:05.800
Hello.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.280
There's a jacket hanging up at my work

16:08.280 --> 16:10.200
that as far as anyone knows is ownerless.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.400
But is it ownerless?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.640
Someone must have left it there when they quit.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.440
It's been like eight months at this point.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.800
Thing is, it's a pretty cool jacket.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.480
It won't fit me, but it would fit my friend

16:26.120 --> 16:27.880
and they would definitely like the style.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.240
I've asked my coworkers and no one has claimed it's theirs.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.480
So it's just sort of in limbo, hanging on a shelf untouched.

16:35.480 --> 16:41.320
Can I take this jacket and how do I do it without being weird?

16:41.320 --> 16:43.960
That's from the Sierra Nevada jacket snatcher.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.920
Now this is the kind of thing where, is there a picture?

16:46.920 --> 16:47.960
No.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.640
Do they include a picture?

16:49.640 --> 16:50.440
Probably not.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.240
No, no picture included.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.640
The only reason that a picture would sort of

16:55.640 --> 16:58.520
put any English on this ball is if the jacket

16:58.520 --> 17:02.440
was like the fucking Scorpion bomber jacket from Drive.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.240
Like some real Ed Hardy trash

17:07.960 --> 17:10.360
that somebody would see you wearing it and be like,

17:10.360 --> 17:14.120
is that the forgotten jacket?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.320
Is that the abandoned jacket?

17:15.320 --> 17:16.280
But they're not wearing it.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.800
They're taking it to give to a friend.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.920
It will be gone.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.200
They'll never see it again.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.320
Off the premises.

17:21.320 --> 17:22.680
To the point where I would say, Griffin,

17:22.680 --> 17:24.120
even if that were the case,

17:24.120 --> 17:26.680
people would be very excited once that jacket was gone.

17:26.680 --> 17:30.680
And there would be an imperceivable freedom

17:31.320 --> 17:34.520
granted upon the office as everyone breathed a little easier

17:34.520 --> 17:36.120
now that the jacket was gone.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.160
I mean, shit, yeah.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.160
I mean, you can't tell your friend where you got it

17:39.160 --> 17:40.440
if you do this.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.960
Unless it was the right kind of friend.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.360
Yeah, the right kind of friend who knows how to party

17:44.360 --> 17:46.360
who's looking for a come up.

17:46.360 --> 17:46.920
You know what I mean?

17:46.920 --> 17:47.480
Yeah, sure.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.080
I think that's what you're describing here

17:49.080 --> 17:51.560
is you're gonna pop some tags.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.000
You see this and you just take it.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.720
You know what I mean?

17:55.720 --> 17:56.440
Yeah.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.080
Now here would be-

17:57.080 --> 17:58.040
You just say you want it.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.040
Here's one method you might try.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.240
I call it transient motive.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.960
What this means is with someone's around

18:03.960 --> 18:05.400
when you pick up the jacket,

18:05.400 --> 18:08.920
you create a motive for that moment.

18:08.920 --> 18:09.960
Do you understand?

18:09.960 --> 18:12.760
So you're like, wait, is this dry clean only?

18:13.480 --> 18:15.160
And you start talking like that

18:15.160 --> 18:17.240
as you're taking it and walking away.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.840
And in that person's head,

18:18.840 --> 18:21.320
they're like, why were they so interested?

18:21.320 --> 18:23.880
If, oh, well, I'm moving on with my life.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.600
And then at that point you're clear, right?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.400
And then it's not like, why are they holding the jacket?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.440
It's just sort of accepted at this point.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.520
You are holding the jacket.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.120
You could also style yourself as like a hero in this moment

18:38.120 --> 18:40.120
and loudly as you pick it up and announce like,

18:40.120 --> 18:41.800
fine, I'll take care of it.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.560
Yeah, that's good.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.720
Or like, if no one else will do it,

18:45.720 --> 18:47.080
I'm taking it to lost and found.

18:47.080 --> 18:47.560
Right.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.680
And then you start walking away

18:48.680 --> 18:51.080
and people are like, where is lost and found?

18:51.080 --> 18:52.360
But that's the name of your friend

18:52.360 --> 18:54.280
who's legally changed it to lost and found.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.880
So then you're not lying.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.960
I'm taking this to the jacket kitchen

18:57.960 --> 19:04.840
where you can donate your used jackets to be eaten.

19:06.280 --> 19:06.840
Fair.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.160
Now I will say that the only hiccup here

19:09.880 --> 19:12.360
is if this is a very seasonal jacket,

19:12.360 --> 19:19.240
perhaps a Green Bay starter jacket from 1998.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.840
Or like Mary Arbor Day.

19:20.840 --> 19:21.560
Sure.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.400
And it has been there for the eight months

19:25.400 --> 19:27.240
since the end of that season, right?

19:27.240 --> 19:29.400
And we're just about to come back to the season

19:29.400 --> 19:30.680
at which it will be appropriate.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.080
Because then the previous owner may for the first time

19:33.080 --> 19:34.360
realize they were without it.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.120
However, at that point,

19:36.120 --> 19:38.280
I would say if nine months or so passes,

19:39.240 --> 19:42.520
the reasonable statement of no one knows

19:42.520 --> 19:46.840
where your jacket is at this point makes complete sense.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.640
No, I don't think that the person who owns the jacket

19:49.640 --> 19:50.840
is coming back for it.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.200
It is this thing of like,

19:53.400 --> 19:55.640
nobody wants to take the initiative.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.000
And I think that's where you could kind of

19:57.640 --> 19:58.920
have a little wiggle room here.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.240
Like you're just making some space.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.600
You're just making a little space.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.160
It's one less thing for people to have to work,

20:05.720 --> 20:06.840
for people to have to look at.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.400
Absolutely.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.200
It's like if there was a car parked on your street

20:10.200 --> 20:12.120
for like eight months and no one moved it.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.560
So you just stole it, right?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.240
Because that's a parking space

20:15.240 --> 20:16.760
that someone else could have, right?

20:16.760 --> 20:17.000
Absolutely.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.920
Oh shit, I got it.

20:18.920 --> 20:19.160
Okay.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.600
I got it.

20:20.600 --> 20:20.920
Go.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.600
Every day you come into work.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.240
You take a little bit of the jacket.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.960
Every day you come to work, you take your jacket off,

20:27.960 --> 20:30.680
put it on a hanger, leave the jacket there.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.440
Eventually you will arrive to work

20:35.640 --> 20:37.960
and there will be no available hangers.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.720
And you will say, hey, is this anybody's?

20:41.720 --> 20:45.000
Is it okay if I move this so I can hang up my jacket?

20:45.720 --> 20:47.720
One of my other jackets.

20:47.720 --> 20:51.160
Then everyone will be like, yeah, go for it.

20:51.160 --> 20:56.040
And then you take it down off the hanger.

20:56.040 --> 20:56.840
You can take it away.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.120
No one will question it.

20:58.120 --> 20:58.680
Now, listen.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.280
And then you hang your jacket up.

21:00.280 --> 21:01.960
Now you have a problem.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.320
This is a brilliant idea, Jocelyn.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.560
It's a little bit of fry and pan fry situation.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.000
There's two issues here.

21:07.000 --> 21:07.880
Now there's 20 jackets.

21:08.840 --> 21:12.760
Well, but the problem is that they work at the Coat Hook Emporium.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.400
So they're always worst ones.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.600
The number of jackets you're gonna have to invest in here.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.160
It's gonna make for a heavy lift, but at the end of the day.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.960
I gotta throw a wrinkle in this question.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.560
You know me, Mr. Wrinkle Tosser.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.960
I love to get into these questions and add a wrinkle.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.960
That's why they call you that.

21:31.960 --> 21:32.460
Yeah.

21:33.160 --> 21:33.800
Hello, brothers.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.240
There's a jacket hanging up at my work

21:35.240 --> 21:37.800
that as far as anyone knows is ownerless.

21:38.920 --> 21:43.480
The phrase in there, as far as anyone knows,

21:43.480 --> 21:47.080
suggests that you have gone cubicle to cubicle

21:47.080 --> 21:49.000
and said, do you know who owns this?

21:49.000 --> 21:53.560
And every single person without fail has said, no, I do not.

21:53.560 --> 21:57.000
There is no way that you have conducted such a canvassing.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.560
You are, there has to be a layer of assumption here of,

22:01.560 --> 22:03.560
well, I don't know who this belongs to.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.920
And a couple of people I've talked to

22:04.920 --> 22:06.440
doesn't know who this belongs to.

22:06.440 --> 22:10.280
So nobody here knows who this belongs to.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.560
It got there somehow.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.640
Someone must have left it here when they quit,

22:15.640 --> 22:18.440
but you don't know wicked for sure though.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.920
Because what if there's a chance that that was somebody's

22:22.920 --> 22:25.720
and then they died in like a horrible accident

22:25.720 --> 22:28.120
and now the jacket is left there as a memorial

22:28.120 --> 22:30.520
and it's been there for years and years and years.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.760
So only like the oldest employees remember,

22:32.760 --> 22:34.680
but God damn it, they remember.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.560
And you haven't asked them

22:35.560 --> 22:37.000
because they're in upper management now

22:37.000 --> 22:38.840
because they put the fucking time in,

22:38.840 --> 22:41.720
which you wouldn't understand kids these days.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.960
But if you take that, they're gonna be like,

22:43.960 --> 22:45.400
who took old Bill's jacket?

22:45.960 --> 22:49.080
No, that was old Bill's old Ed Hardy jacket.

22:50.200 --> 22:55.240
He loved Ed Hardy as much as he loves saving kids from car wrecks.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.440
You could come in dressed up in a costume,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.920
big leather vest, big bushy beard,

23:02.920 --> 23:08.680
a clown cap on, fucking wellies on your feet.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.520
And fucking cool disco pants and two different gloves.

23:12.520 --> 23:15.560
And you walk in and you pick up the jacket and you said,

23:15.560 --> 23:16.680
there it is.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.560
And then everybody else who's there would be like,

23:21.560 --> 23:25.800
oh, I guess that like really weird guy

23:26.360 --> 23:27.960
is who that jacket belonged to.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.800
Well, mystery solved.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.360
Can't wait for fucking Tyler to get back so he can tell.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.000
Wait a minute.

23:34.040 --> 23:38.200
Was that person roughly Tyler's size

23:38.200 --> 23:40.280
but dressed up in a bunch of wild garments

23:40.280 --> 23:42.280
that they've been stealing from all the other jobs

23:42.280 --> 23:43.000
they've ever worked?

23:43.560 --> 23:45.640
Damn, almost got away with it too.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.080
I don't know that we're gonna be able to help with this one,

23:49.080 --> 23:49.960
but I think I do have-

23:49.960 --> 23:51.080
I feel like we tried though.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.600
We tried really hard.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.360
I do have one that we might be able to help with

23:54.360 --> 23:57.960
and it's if we do approach the wizard,

23:57.960 --> 23:59.400
Taylor sent this in, thank you.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.760
And it's a WikiHow called how to choose a nickname for your car.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.440
Oh, thank fuck.

24:04.440 --> 24:09.320
Yeah, I've had so many fucking cars now, like-

24:09.320 --> 24:10.360
Braggart.

24:10.360 --> 24:15.000
Three, and I have not gotten nicknames for any of them.

24:15.000 --> 24:15.500
Ooh.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.720
At least none that I would put out into the world,

24:19.720 --> 24:21.400
maybe in my heart of hearts.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.600
The problem for me has always been

24:22.600 --> 24:24.760
that I didn't know their given name, right?

24:24.760 --> 24:26.920
So like if I wanted to call him Johnny, right?

24:26.920 --> 24:28.840
But what if their real name isn't Jonathan, right?

24:28.840 --> 24:30.120
And now it's just fucking weird.

24:30.120 --> 24:34.040
Right, and it's like also that I don't drive that much,

24:34.040 --> 24:37.000
like I use my computer a lot more

24:37.000 --> 24:39.080
and I didn't nickname my computer.

24:39.720 --> 24:40.440
Oh, you didn't?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.640
No, it's just a computer.

24:43.640 --> 24:44.760
Mine's Jeremy Bits.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.920
Jeremy Bits, okay.

24:46.920 --> 24:47.420
Yep.

24:49.320 --> 24:53.880
That was also my stage name during my ill-fated stand-up comedy career.

24:53.880 --> 24:54.760
Yeah, Jeremy Bits.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.600
I wouldn't call it ill-fated, Juice.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.320
I'm ahead of myself.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.880
You're a runner-up season three of Last Comic Standing.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.680
You got a Comedy Central 30-Minute Stand-Up Special.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.000
I did Leno, but it's when he was at 10 p.m.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah, I thought it was fucked up though

25:07.000 --> 25:10.200
how Leno really made you censor a lot of your darker stuff.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.800
Yeah, there was a lot.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.880
And it wasn't even like that the words you were saying

25:13.880 --> 25:15.640
were like banned by, you know, anybody.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.080
It was just the concept.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.040
He didn't like the idea.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.280
He said it was so challenging.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.640
I don't like the ideas.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.320
You really make people think about their deaths.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.240
Yeah, I don't like those ideas.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.840
Do different ideas.

25:28.840 --> 25:31.880
And it's like, J, that's not really how-

25:31.880 --> 25:33.160
Do some Cars ones.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.440
So here's how to brainstorm.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.320
Speaking of Cars ones,

25:37.320 --> 25:40.120
here's some good ways to come up with car names.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.960
Think of the name of a beautiful person.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.520
One of the most common ways to name your car

25:44.520 --> 25:46.120
is to think of a celebrity or model you like

25:46.120 --> 25:47.080
and give it the same name.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.040
Awesome.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.200
Oh, Oscar Isaacs.

25:50.200 --> 25:50.920
It's perfect.

25:51.960 --> 25:52.760
I'm worried, Juice,

25:52.760 --> 25:54.680
that Travis is going to be freaky good at this.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.360
Yeah, I don't like it already, the way it's going.

25:58.360 --> 26:02.520
Some good names include Claire, Stella, Brock, and Venus.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.400
Bright.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.760
I don't know that you can just be like,

26:04.760 --> 26:06.440
this is my car, Claire.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.920
Yeah, well, then you,

26:08.920 --> 26:11.400
Trav, you may want to just chill for like five minutes

26:11.960 --> 26:15.400
because you cannot scrutinize this wiki Howl in that way.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.560
I'm just saying that that's not a nickname though.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.240
That's a name.

26:19.240 --> 26:19.960
Yeah.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.720
Name the car after your favorite musician

26:21.720 --> 26:22.920
or cartoon character.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.120
If you're looking around for names

26:24.120 --> 26:25.480
that aren't commonly used for people-

26:25.480 --> 26:26.760
Carlos Santana.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.760
Yeah, fucking hell, Travis.

26:30.680 --> 26:31.720
Turn yourself off.

26:31.720 --> 26:32.600
And here's the thing,

26:32.600 --> 26:34.680
it doesn't matter what make or model it is.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.600
It could be literally anything.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.760
Car names that are based on musicians or artists

26:38.760 --> 26:41.240
include Sid, Beyonce, and Bono.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.080
Now, but they, Bono?

26:43.080 --> 26:45.080
But here's the thing, in the picture,

26:45.080 --> 26:47.000
the horrible pictures that wikiHowl has,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.840
they got like a blue Corvette

26:49.800 --> 26:51.640
and then there's a picture of Donald Duck

26:51.640 --> 26:53.240
just like hovering over it.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.760
This is my Corvette.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.840
This is my Corvette.

26:56.840 --> 26:57.560
Donald Duck.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.360
The duck from Mickey.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.280
Add a prefix or adjective to the name.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.960
Adding a prefix like Ms or Mr

27:03.960 --> 27:06.360
will add some character to the car name that you choose.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.880
And there's a picture of a man

27:07.880 --> 27:09.000
and he does have a goatee

27:09.000 --> 27:10.760
and he's yelling, Mr. Donald.

27:10.760 --> 27:11.800
What?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.960
This is my Corvette, Mr. Donald.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.040
This is my Corvette, Mr. Donald.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.640
Hey, excuse me, Valet,

27:17.640 --> 27:20.440
could you go pick up Mr. Donald, please?

27:20.440 --> 27:22.440
Good adjectives for your name include colors

27:22.440 --> 27:23.960
like white, black, or silver.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.640
Mr. Blue Donald, Mr. Blue Donald.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.400
Is there a Mr. Blue Donald here?

27:28.200 --> 27:29.080
Whose car is this?

27:29.080 --> 27:30.440
There's a bumper sticker on the back

27:30.440 --> 27:32.120
that says white Mr. Donald.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.120
Good starting adjectives for your car

27:36.120 --> 27:38.840
include things like super, baby, or old.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.440
Hey, whose car is this that says

27:40.440 --> 27:42.520
super baby white Mr. Donald on it?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.320
Hi, I'm looking for my car.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.240
It's named super white, Mr. Donald.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.560
Wait, is there a comma in there?

27:49.560 --> 27:49.960
Somewhere.

27:49.960 --> 27:50.460
Nope.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.320
This next one's awesome

27:53.320 --> 27:56.520
because it's coming in at the very middle

27:56.520 --> 27:57.800
of this WikiHow article.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.000
Search online for other popular car names.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.360
I don't fucking know, man.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.960
I got a Kia Sorrento.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.520
I tried calling it white Mr. Donald Duck,

28:06.520 --> 28:08.120
but people hated that name.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.000
So just-

28:09.000 --> 28:09.960
Mia Sorvino.

28:11.240 --> 28:11.740
Fuck!

28:13.080 --> 28:14.840
Did you mean Kia Sorvino?

28:14.840 --> 28:16.120
That works too, yeah.

28:16.120 --> 28:16.440
Okay.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.000
Trav, just take it clean.

28:19.000 --> 28:19.560
Take it clean.

28:19.560 --> 28:25.080
Take it- Kia Sorrento.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.920
So use an online name generator

28:26.920 --> 28:28.280
to the next one and that's the same thing.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.200
Matching the name with the style of the car.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.920
Base the name on the shape and size of the car.

28:32.920 --> 28:33.880
Look at the body of the car.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.640
If it's blocky, bulky, or powerful,

28:35.640 --> 28:37.080
a more masculine name may-

28:38.840 --> 28:40.680
If it's sleek, sexy, mysterious,

28:40.680 --> 28:42.600
a feminine name may suit it better.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.800
God, I mean WikiHow.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.960
And so there's a picture of a big-

28:45.960 --> 28:47.320
What's that car's ass do?

28:47.320 --> 28:50.520
And here's a big like scary SUV

28:51.160 --> 28:53.800
and it says Wolverine

28:53.800 --> 28:55.480
and then there's a check mark

28:56.040 --> 28:59.240
and then it says Christine

28:59.240 --> 29:00.280
and then there's an X.

29:00.920 --> 29:05.160
Even though there's the most famous scary car ever

29:06.120 --> 29:10.920
is named Christine from the John Carpenter film.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.240
Those two also are not comparable.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.560
Like no one has ever said,

29:15.560 --> 29:17.400
uh yeah, I'm having a baby.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.840
If it's a girl, Christine

29:18.840 --> 29:20.360
and if it's a boy, Wolverine.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah, include the maker model in the name.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.040
You can make it like a Camry.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.120
So I have a Subaru that I call Ruby Sue.

29:30.760 --> 29:31.640
Yeah, that's good.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.760
I mean, that's a good one.

29:32.760 --> 29:35.320
Choose the name based on the type of car that you drive.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.640
That's, you already fucking said that.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.680
Yeah, the Slamberghini, by the way,

29:41.400 --> 29:43.080
I don't know if anyone who listens to this show

29:43.080 --> 29:44.040
has a Lamborghini,

29:44.040 --> 29:46.360
but Slamberghini is just a great thing to call your car.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.560
It's a pretty good one.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.040
For instance, you wouldn't want to name a slow truck

29:50.040 --> 29:52.680
with the name supercharged or red hot

29:52.680 --> 29:54.680
because it doesn't represent the aesthetic of the car.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.560
Bullshit.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.920
They have a picture of a truck here

29:56.920 --> 30:00.120
and the word that they have emblazoned over it is big rhino.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.200
That's pretty good.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.400
But I'm just saying that this person

30:03.400 --> 30:05.240
who's written this WikiHow article

30:05.240 --> 30:07.800
has very little concept of ironic nicknames

30:07.800 --> 30:09.480
where you call like a big guy tiny

30:09.480 --> 30:12.920
because calling like a very slow truck,

30:12.920 --> 30:15.960
like calling it like hot pepper or something

30:15.960 --> 30:17.080
is fucking baller.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.200
I love that.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.040
And then name it based on color.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.440
Names include Nightcrawler, Cherry Bomb,

30:22.440 --> 30:24.280
Mr. Freeze, Cookie Monster, Frogger,

30:24.280 --> 30:25.800
Mean Green, and Creamsicle.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.400
Hop in the Creamsicle.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.200
Oh, wow.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.280
Have you guys ever tried to actually get like,

30:30.920 --> 30:33.400
it's pretty hard to get a nickname going for your car.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.080
I've done it for myself a lot.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.040
Yeah, I know.

30:36.040 --> 30:36.680
To get out of pity.

30:37.560 --> 30:41.000
Hoops, The Kid, Mr. J.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.040
Yeah, that one we need to talk about, by the way.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.480
That one hasn't caught on as much.

30:45.480 --> 30:46.520
It's hard for your car

30:46.520 --> 30:49.400
because like the only way to get it going

30:49.400 --> 30:53.480
is to like sheepishly admit it to your wife

30:53.480 --> 30:54.920
that there's a nickname for it.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.200
And if she's going to mention it,

30:56.200 --> 30:58.600
it'd be nice if she, okay, nevermind.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.320
Honey, I don't know why.

30:59.320 --> 30:59.720
I'm sorry.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.160
I don't know why I brought it up.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.120
Ignore me, stupid.

31:02.120 --> 31:02.920
There's only one.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.600
I don't know why I called my Honda a Pilot Sully.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.680
I thought it was funny because the Pilot Sully.

31:08.680 --> 31:10.920
Yeah, no, you didn't think it was funny, funny.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.680
I just thought it was like, not funny,

31:12.680 --> 31:16.440
but kind of like nodding acknowledgement kind of deal.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.160
You know what I mean?

31:17.160 --> 31:20.200
There's a mystery amongst some of my friends

31:20.200 --> 31:24.200
where our mutual friend Bobby had this white car

31:24.840 --> 31:26.440
and he went back home for a weekend.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.280
And when he came back,

31:28.280 --> 31:32.680
that white car had across the windshield, the Gambler.

31:33.400 --> 31:37.320
And now Bobby claims that the white car died

31:37.960 --> 31:40.120
and he bought a different white car that weekend.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.440
And that one happened to be the same make and model.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.880
It just said the Gambler across.

31:43.880 --> 31:44.920
That was the only difference.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.560
And I have no idea to this day if that's true or not,

31:49.560 --> 31:52.280
but that's a good way to get a nickname going for your car

31:52.280 --> 31:54.760
to just add it to the windshield.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.320
Yeah.

31:55.320 --> 31:59.000
Can I call my car the Michael Dukakis

31:59.000 --> 32:01.880
1988 presidential election campaign bus?

32:03.720 --> 32:04.360
I mean, yes.

32:04.360 --> 32:04.920
Is that?

32:05.560 --> 32:06.120
Oh, shit.

32:06.120 --> 32:06.520
I shouldn't.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.960
People might like find me at live shows now.

32:09.960 --> 32:10.920
Damn it, Travis.

32:12.200 --> 32:12.600
Fuck.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.240
The only other shit on here is like,

32:15.800 --> 32:16.920
really think about it.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.120
And really think about it.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.000
And then there's a picture.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.760
There's a very Ferris Bueller looking cartoon man

32:26.760 --> 32:29.400
laying on a pillow and there's a thought balloon.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.120
And inside the thought balloon, it says Silver Surfer,

32:32.120 --> 32:34.120
Bio Silver, Chroma.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.280
That's a cool fucking thing.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.680
I wish I could shut out the fucking demons.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.640
Bio Silver?

32:39.640 --> 32:41.000
Bio Silver.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.720
I wish I could shut out the demons in my head for a minute

32:43.720 --> 32:47.160
and think about shit like bad car names.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.160
Sometimes they just come to you unbidden.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.440
You don't have to think about them.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.880
It's just how your brain works.

32:53.880 --> 32:54.120
Yeah.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.760
You definitely have like a disease.

32:56.760 --> 32:56.920
Yeah.

32:56.920 --> 32:57.800
It's called ADD.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.280
Oh, boy.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.080
Howdy.

33:03.080 --> 33:03.480
Trav.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.680
Car-D-D.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.480
Car-D-D.

33:05.480 --> 33:05.720
What?

33:05.720 --> 33:06.840
Car-D-D.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.280
Juice, you don't have the touch.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.480
You don't have the glow.

33:09.480 --> 33:09.880
ADD.

33:09.880 --> 33:10.840
Car-A-D.

33:11.880 --> 33:12.120
No.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.160
So we're going to go to-

33:15.160 --> 33:16.200
AWDD.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.560
Because it's like all wheel drive.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.160
We're going to get the fuck out of here.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.360
We got to go to the fucking money zone.

33:20.360 --> 33:21.160
Go, go, go, go.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.040
I need to hire some people.

33:32.600 --> 33:32.840
Yeah.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.480
Yeah.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.120
Perfect thing for that.

33:34.120 --> 33:34.760
But here's the thing.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.680
It's hard to pick things.

33:36.680 --> 33:41.720
I have a hard time making a decision as to what shirts to wear in the morning,

33:41.720 --> 33:46.280
a thing that has no impact on barely my life, let alone anyone else's.

33:46.840 --> 33:51.960
So the idea of having to pick a human being to hire for a thing

33:51.960 --> 33:56.600
is one of the most imposing, terrifying decisions.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.840
That's why I'm glad that there are things like Zip Recruiter.

34:00.600 --> 34:05.640
Because Zip Recruiter is the adult who will help you hire somebody.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.200
Right?

34:06.200 --> 34:06.840
Right.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.880
They're the parent or teacher that can come in and make it better.

34:10.360 --> 34:10.920
Yes.

34:10.920 --> 34:15.000
Because they're going to make sure all of the qualified candidates come right to you.

34:15.880 --> 34:21.720
And you can invite your top choices to apply for the job through Zip Recruiter.

34:21.720 --> 34:23.080
Get in here, Mark.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.040
Don't be shy.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.240
I know you're the man.

34:25.240 --> 34:26.040
You're the one.

34:26.040 --> 34:26.760
You're the man, Mark.

34:26.760 --> 34:31.000
Does Zip Recruiter have a feature that shows you the employee that you had dreamed of

34:31.000 --> 34:32.440
was inside you all along?

34:32.440 --> 34:33.880
Is that an option where it's like-

34:33.880 --> 34:35.240
That's a premium service.

34:35.240 --> 34:35.960
Premium service.

34:36.920 --> 34:41.000
They also have one where a group of teenage girls ask you questions about like,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.080
what house do you think you'll have when you get married?

34:43.080 --> 34:46.120
And that helps you choose the right employee for you.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.640
But that's an up charge.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.000
It's like a billion dollars.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
That's like a billion dollars for that.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.560
But you can sign up.

34:55.560 --> 34:59.640
Do they have a thing where they'll take an employee that already works there

34:59.640 --> 35:03.880
and they'll take off their glasses and they're like, maybe this is them?

35:03.880 --> 35:04.440
You know what I mean?

35:04.440 --> 35:06.280
But extra for ponytail removal.

35:06.920 --> 35:07.480
Yeah, right.

35:08.760 --> 35:12.360
They have a feature on Zip Recruiter where you can pick an employee

35:12.360 --> 35:14.280
from a different company that you'd never hire

35:14.280 --> 35:17.720
and then they take that employee away and make them really cool and beautiful

35:17.720 --> 35:19.000
and make them prom queen.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.080
And you're like, oh man, now I love them.

35:21.080 --> 35:21.880
And you hire them.

35:22.440 --> 35:25.880
And then they also have a service where if you can't find the perfect candidate

35:25.880 --> 35:27.400
that has all the skills you need,

35:27.400 --> 35:29.800
they will find like three or four different candidates

35:29.800 --> 35:31.720
that have some of the skills you need.

35:31.720 --> 35:35.480
And then they put them in a big tub full of proprietary fluid

35:35.480 --> 35:36.920
and they don't tell you what the fluid is.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.360
That's probably for the best.

35:38.360 --> 35:45.320
And then nine months later out pops a single amalgamated business entity.

35:48.600 --> 35:53.560
The shape of it is not recognizably human,

35:54.120 --> 35:57.320
but it does do like 130 words per minute.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.360
So that's pretty good.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.560
So you can't beat that.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.440
And you can sign up for not that service,

36:02.440 --> 36:05.160
but the other ones that we talked about early on in the ad

36:05.160 --> 36:08.440
before we went some places.

36:08.440 --> 36:12.280
If you go to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother,

36:12.280 --> 36:13.800
you can try Zip Recruiter for free.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.680
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.160
Please don't tell them about a lot of the stuff we said.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.600
Please don't tell any of our-

36:20.600 --> 36:21.480
Oh my God.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.520
Blankest statement.

36:23.160 --> 36:26.440
Don't tattle on us to any of our advertisers

36:26.440 --> 36:29.640
because then the shit's going to get boring.

36:29.640 --> 36:30.520
They're going to have to be like,

36:30.520 --> 36:32.440
Zip Recruiter does a business one.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.000
If you get that, you get 10 buck dollars.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.000
Snooze effect, right?

36:37.560 --> 36:39.880
Hey, do you know what's exciting for me though?

36:39.880 --> 36:40.600
My dreams.

36:41.240 --> 36:41.960
Is it my dreams?

36:41.960 --> 36:43.400
Do you have a good one?

36:43.400 --> 36:45.480
Oh, I have great dreams every night.

36:45.480 --> 36:47.960
Playing laser tag with Michael Dukakis.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.720
I had a dream recently.

36:49.720 --> 36:53.320
There was a crossover between Full House and Buffy the Vampire Slayer

36:53.320 --> 36:56.120
and I saved Uncle Jesse from a vampire trap.

36:56.120 --> 36:56.840
And that was pretty good.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.600
Yeah, that's definitely who would save who

36:59.320 --> 37:01.400
if you two were in a vampire trap together.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.440
Squarespace though helps make your dreams a reality,

37:04.440 --> 37:05.720
except for the dream that Travis had,

37:05.720 --> 37:07.720
which I think we can all agree is total bullshit.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.920
They will help you build a website

37:10.920 --> 37:12.120
that can showcase your work,

37:12.120 --> 37:13.720
sell products and services of all kinds

37:13.720 --> 37:15.560
to promote your physical or online business.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.160
And more.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.800
And they do that with these beautiful customizable templates

37:19.800 --> 37:21.800
created by world-class designers.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.800
Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.240
So don't freak out about it.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.520
Yeah, sure.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.360
And if you want to know if your website's sick,

37:28.360 --> 37:29.880
they got analytics for it.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.200
And they do free and secure hosting.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.960
So there's just nothing to really worry about,

37:36.520 --> 37:39.640
except like how you're going to spend all of your website money

37:39.640 --> 37:42.280
that you're going to get when the big bucks are rolling in.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.000
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.040
And when you're ready to launch,

37:46.040 --> 37:48.440

37:48.440 --> 37:50.760
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

37:53.880 --> 37:54.920
I'm Jesse Thorne.

37:54.920 --> 37:56.200
This week on Bullseye,

37:56.200 --> 37:58.440
David Byrne on the talking heads,

37:58.440 --> 38:00.520
easing back into live performance,

38:00.520 --> 38:01.880
and the magic of Doo-Wop.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.080
You don't get it very much.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.520
People doing dibbidi-dip-dip,

38:04.520 --> 38:06.760
whoa, whoa, nama-nama-nama-nama.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.280
You don't get a lot of that.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.520
Listen to Bullseye from Maximumfun.org and NPR.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.720
Griffin, you got another Yahoo! for us?

38:22.600 --> 38:23.800
Not for a while now, Justin.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.280
Let me reach into the fucking time well.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.640
Hold on.

38:27.640 --> 38:31.080
Oh no, I've fallen down into the time well.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.080
Oh no, he's an old man now, Justin.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.000
Oh no, he went too far the other way and he's a baby.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.320
He's a baby?

38:41.320 --> 38:43.000
Yeah, let's see if we can catch him right in the middle.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.320
I'll grab him by the back of his collar and pull him out.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.120
Whatever, dad, fuck you.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.160
Nah, damn it.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.520
I got him when he was 45.

38:50.520 --> 38:53.960
Man, that's some-

38:53.960 --> 38:55.720
Do you not have a Munch Squad, my friend?

38:55.720 --> 39:00.200
I have like too many and it's starting to feel like this predictable thing.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.640
It felt too predictable.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.720
It used to be a fun energy, you know what I mean?

39:03.720 --> 39:04.840
And now I'm having to beg for it.

39:04.840 --> 39:05.720
I love it.

39:05.720 --> 39:06.680
I love the energy.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.400
First of all, do the fucking song.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.760
Play the song, Eric Clapton.

39:10.760 --> 39:23.800
Okay, Munch Squad, this is a new theme song.

39:23.800 --> 39:24.600
It's pretty good.

39:24.600 --> 39:31.000
Why don't you just give us some log lines and then let me and Travis be your navigators

39:31.000 --> 39:32.760
through this wire if there's something that-

39:32.760 --> 39:34.200
I don't fucking trust you guys to do that.

39:34.200 --> 39:34.520
Okay.

39:34.520 --> 39:35.320
Oh, okay.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.680
Honey Baked Ham has a new-

39:36.680 --> 39:40.280
Okay, first off, I have just sort of an addendum.

39:40.280 --> 39:40.840
A correction.

39:41.640 --> 39:41.960
Okay.

39:41.960 --> 39:42.360
What'd you do?

39:43.720 --> 39:44.920
A quick addendum.

39:44.920 --> 39:45.560
Not a correction.

39:45.560 --> 39:46.120
What'd you do?

39:47.720 --> 39:48.280
No, nothing.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.240
What'd you fuck up?

39:49.240 --> 39:54.360
I did ask John Hodgman if the Taco Bell Crispy Chicken Sandwich taco where they're trying

39:54.360 --> 39:55.640
to get beef going.

39:55.640 --> 40:00.440
Hodgman has made basically his entire career is based around deciding whether or not a

40:00.440 --> 40:01.400
hot dog is a sandwich.

40:01.400 --> 40:01.800
I noticed that.

40:01.800 --> 40:07.320
So I asked him to like weigh in on this and he said, and this is sort of like official,

40:07.320 --> 40:10.680
as you can hear on his podcast, Judging on Hodgman, he makes these sorts of rulings all

40:10.680 --> 40:11.720
the time and they are binding.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.000
It's a taco inspired by a sandwich.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.200
That's what Hodgman told me.

40:16.200 --> 40:16.680
All right.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.560
So that's official.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.040
I like that.

40:18.040 --> 40:21.160
He said, it's like, you know, like the famous Reuben taco.

40:23.960 --> 40:27.800
And then like an hour later, he texted me, or a tuna melt taco.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.120
Well, we get the concept, I think.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.320
We got you, Hodgman.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.680
Do you know what happened with that last one is Hodgman thought about a tuna melt taco

40:34.680 --> 40:36.280
and he's like, fuck, that'd be delicious.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.280
That's what he actually said.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.560
Like, now I'm thinking about it.

40:39.560 --> 40:40.600
I think he made himself hungry.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.880
I think so too.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.720
I think he practiced the secret.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.080
I think he was visualizing.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.320
Honey baked ham is doing pumpkin spice glazed turkey breast.

40:49.320 --> 40:49.800
That sucks.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.400
Yeah, it sucks, right?

40:51.400 --> 40:52.280
Yeah, that's great.

40:53.240 --> 40:59.720
What's wild is like in preparation for this limited time offering, Honey Baked did a survey

41:00.520 --> 41:04.120
and they're like, the results reinforce the demand for fall flavor starts now.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.720
Now, 69% agree fall has the best seasonal flavors.

41:07.720 --> 41:12.360
In fact, 70% of people agree pumpkin spice is an essential part of the fall season.

41:12.360 --> 41:13.960
Okay, but those are two different things.

41:14.600 --> 41:19.240
Those are two different things because you're saying that a lot of people love fall flavors

41:19.800 --> 41:24.520
and they acknowledge that pumpkin spice is essential to fall.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.840
Not that they love pumpkin spice.

41:26.840 --> 41:31.560
65% of people said pumpkin spice flavors should be available August through October.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.200
That's true.

41:32.200 --> 41:35.960
And 15% want the flavor to be available all year.

41:35.960 --> 41:41.560
So 65%, 59% said spending time with family and friends for gatherings is a favorite fall

41:41.560 --> 41:42.040
activity.

41:42.040 --> 41:42.360
Okay.

41:42.360 --> 41:47.000
And 71% of respondents said they feel disappointed when they miss out on an experience.

41:48.040 --> 41:48.360
What?

41:49.880 --> 41:52.440
There had to be a bit where you're like, what did you ask?

41:52.440 --> 41:54.360
I'm sorry, one more time.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.000
Sorry, I said that.

41:56.040 --> 41:59.160
I just asked if you feel disappointed when you miss out on an experience.

41:59.160 --> 42:03.000
Do you mean a honey baked ham sandwich experience or just any experience?

42:03.000 --> 42:05.080
Just any experience.

42:05.080 --> 42:07.880
It's like, well, fuck, was this for ham?

42:07.880 --> 42:11.640
Can you say 75%, Justin?

42:13.160 --> 42:18.360
71% of respondents said they feel disappointed when they quote, I'm just reading,

42:18.360 --> 42:19.880
miss out on an experience.

42:19.880 --> 42:23.320
I want to meet that other 29% who are so comfortable with themselves.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.200
They're like, if I miss it, I didn't need to be there, I guess.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.520
You're just like, I would have just fucked it up.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.440
You know what I mean?

42:30.440 --> 42:32.520
It probably wouldn't even been nearly as good.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.120
An experience.

42:34.120 --> 42:34.840
An experience.

42:34.840 --> 42:35.800
An experience.

42:35.800 --> 42:40.120
An experience, not good or bad, just 30% people are like, oh.

42:41.320 --> 42:43.400
Yeah, man, I swear, God, the aliens landed.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.280
I was not present at the Point Pleasant Silver Bridge collapse.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.200
Damn it.

42:50.200 --> 42:50.680
Fuck.

42:50.680 --> 42:51.240
Damn.

42:51.240 --> 42:51.740
Shit.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.920
And I heard there was some really good ham there afterwards.

42:54.920 --> 42:58.600
But Pumpkin Spice, they're doing Pumpkin Spice ham.

42:58.600 --> 42:59.880
Yeah, okay, sure.

43:00.520 --> 43:01.400
Why the fuck not?

43:02.520 --> 43:03.080
Yeah, why not?

43:03.080 --> 43:06.440
But that's not really what I'm kind of, the thing I actually want to talk about.

43:06.440 --> 43:07.560
I just think that's funny.

43:07.560 --> 43:11.960
They did, there's like, guys, there's like a whole thing about what would you do?

43:11.960 --> 43:17.800
Here's what Pumpkin Spice lovers are willing to do to make it a year long, year round thing, right?

43:17.800 --> 43:18.600
I'd murder.

43:18.600 --> 43:21.720
28% of people would shave their head bald.

43:22.360 --> 43:23.000
Okay.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.800
27% of people would go a month without internet access.

43:25.800 --> 43:26.600
No, you would not.

43:26.600 --> 43:30.440
27% of people would give up their smartphone for a year.

43:30.440 --> 43:31.880
Bullshit.

43:31.880 --> 43:36.280
Just learn where to buy Pumpkin Spice.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.920
It's a combination of flavor, you could do it yourself.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.960
It's like just nutmeg and cinnamon.

43:41.960 --> 43:46.760
They sell it, you can get bottles of it in the spice aisle with everything else.

43:47.640 --> 43:51.800
Anyway, Wendy's unveils hot and crispy French fry innovation.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.240
This is what I'm talking about.

43:53.240 --> 43:53.960
I'm going to stand up.

43:53.960 --> 43:54.600
Yeah.

43:54.600 --> 43:57.960
This is what I do Munch Squad for, because this is actual news, okay?

43:57.960 --> 44:00.360
It's been fucking 11 years, okay?

44:00.360 --> 44:07.400
For the first time, the chain is updating its number one selling product, which is, of course,

44:08.600 --> 44:09.640
the French fry.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.600
The French fry.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.000
The Wendy's French fry.

44:13.000 --> 44:18.840
Now, it's been 11 years since we've touched this recipe, and now we're going back to the drive.

44:18.840 --> 44:19.640
We're going to change it.

44:19.640 --> 44:26.120
The tag that they're using, they're sort of like in the drive-by, you see a lot of drive-by

44:26.120 --> 44:30.520
fast food coverage, and it's just like, we just need a quote, so what do you think?

44:31.480 --> 44:39.000
And they're like, yeah, it's like a lot of places do it bad, and we're going to do it good.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.720
They say the fast food chain developed this new fry offering to put an quote

44:43.720 --> 44:50.280
in to the disappointing, inconsistent fry experiences that other places still serve.

44:50.280 --> 44:51.320
You see what they're doing here?

44:51.320 --> 44:54.680
They're putting their fuck up on everyone else's food.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.760
They're not changing it, you're right.

44:56.760 --> 45:01.800
Not because we fuck it up, but other places do.

45:01.800 --> 45:07.560
Yeah, we're going to carry even more of the weight than we have already.

45:07.560 --> 45:08.600
The ball's in their court.

45:08.600 --> 45:13.800
QSR Magazine, which is sort of my sort of like secret source, my number one source for like,

45:13.800 --> 45:15.720
when I want to go behind the headlines.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.440
It's your secret sauce source.

45:18.440 --> 45:24.920
Yeah, so this has an interview with John Lee, Wendy's vice president of culinary innovation,

45:24.920 --> 45:30.920
who is probably a genius at his job, but probably is one of the wilder interview

45:30.920 --> 45:31.480
subjects.

45:31.480 --> 45:35.560
I've seen a lot of John Lee's work, and it gets pretty wild every single time.

45:35.560 --> 45:38.920
Um, here's the example.

45:38.920 --> 45:41.560
It's basically one of those things where they're good.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.400
That's already a great start.

45:43.400 --> 45:48.120
It's basically one of those things where there were good fries out there, but there

45:48.120 --> 45:49.640
are not great fries out there.

45:49.640 --> 45:54.920
And we collectively got together and we told ourselves two and a half years ago that good

45:54.920 --> 45:56.520
is definitely not good enough.

45:56.520 --> 46:00.040
Now, earlier in this interview, he says that they've been working on this recipe for months.

46:00.760 --> 46:04.280
So I guess it was like two years where they were like, we gotta do something about the

46:04.280 --> 46:07.480
fries, cause like, yeah, yeah, we don't even start.

46:08.360 --> 46:12.280
We're going to go full court press and figure out what's the best way to have our customers

46:12.280 --> 46:12.680
backs.

46:13.480 --> 46:19.320
If fries are the most ordered menu item, we're going to create the best possible fry.

46:19.320 --> 46:25.960
So they, they asked John Lee, um, how, uh, tell me how your team has been approaching

46:25.960 --> 46:29.880
reinventing the fry and to land this new hot and crispy game changer.

46:29.880 --> 46:32.280
So hi, my name is Justin McElroy.

46:32.280 --> 46:37.800
Uh, I'm going to do my, my, uh, dramatic monologue is John Lee's answer to this question.

46:38.360 --> 46:39.800
Uh, and I'd like to read it for you now.

46:39.800 --> 46:40.840
And do you, I'm sorry.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.000
Do you have a headshot that we could, uh, peruse?

46:43.000 --> 46:43.800
Yeah, thank you.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.080
Uh, here.

46:45.080 --> 46:45.480
Okay.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.720
And do you, I'm so sorry to, I don't want to break your flow.

46:47.720 --> 46:48.520
Do you have a butt shot?

46:50.120 --> 46:52.520
No, uh, it's on my Instagram.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.320
It's just all butt shots.

46:53.320 --> 46:54.040
Can you show me your butt?

46:56.200 --> 46:57.720
This is what you want.

46:57.720 --> 47:00.280
You gotta get the, make it clap.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.600
Hey, make it clap.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.360
Uh, you gotta get the right potato.

47:05.320 --> 47:09.080
Once you get the right potato, you gotta make sure you're applying the right process.

47:09.880 --> 47:15.400
And we have a signature proprietary process that allows us to get the fry.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.120
Oh yeah.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.120
That's the way he puts it.

47:18.840 --> 47:21.880
You gotta do it in a way that our customers want it.

47:22.520 --> 47:25.000
So there's, so there's a whole bunch of forms.

47:25.960 --> 47:26.440
What?

47:26.440 --> 47:28.200
We've done a lot of research.

47:28.200 --> 47:29.560
There's a whole bunch of shapes.

47:29.560 --> 47:30.600
What?

47:30.600 --> 47:34.120
And there's a lot of different routes we could have taken to create new news.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.720
Oh man, sliding doors.

47:36.840 --> 47:41.640
The problem is to say true to our heritage and the roots and what Dave Thomas expected

47:41.640 --> 47:43.560
in terms of the perfect French fry.

47:43.560 --> 47:49.240
And then based on the research of what consumers really want, which is a fry that is hot and

47:49.240 --> 47:51.880
crispy, we actually landed on what we have today.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.640
So it looks like your standard French fry.

47:55.640 --> 47:58.360
It is not your standard French fry.

47:58.360 --> 48:03.160
The reality is sometimes they got it right the first time out in regards to shape.

48:04.360 --> 48:06.680
There's specifics around how we cut our fry.

48:06.680 --> 48:08.600
It was done right the first time around.

48:08.600 --> 48:10.920
So we didn't have to do much to fix that.

48:11.480 --> 48:16.040
But applying a proprietary process and being really careful about the partners we choose.

48:16.920 --> 48:17.160
What?

48:17.160 --> 48:22.520
And having the right raw materials coming in from a potato perspective.

48:22.520 --> 48:23.240
Oh my God.

48:24.200 --> 48:25.720
Gets us out where we're at today.

48:25.720 --> 48:26.040
Okay.

48:26.040 --> 48:29.080
Now, and then obviously we have our ops partnerships too.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.920
They do a fantastic job.

48:30.920 --> 48:33.080
We are trained properly.

48:33.080 --> 48:33.720
We've got that.

48:34.360 --> 48:41.000
We got certified people working those fryers and they care and are as passionate as we

48:41.000 --> 48:48.120
are about making sure that the guest experience is awesome every time they bite into it.

48:48.120 --> 48:49.960
Why am I standing up and salute?

48:49.960 --> 48:55.080
Like I'm saluting with my hand over my heart and I don't know like how I got to this position.

48:55.080 --> 48:59.000
I, listeners, I want you to rewind back to the beginning of Justin doing it and then

48:59.000 --> 48:59.800
listen again.

48:59.800 --> 49:05.560
And this time I want you to picture Justin standing in front of several like corkboards

49:05.560 --> 49:10.680
with like string wrapped around like thumbtacks going from thing to thing as he points out.

49:10.680 --> 49:17.640
And just imagine that John Lee has been awake for four weeks prior to this interview.

49:19.800 --> 49:20.840
I'm a ketchup eater.

49:20.840 --> 49:25.480
I'm not afraid to admit it.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.000
I'm a ketchup eater.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.200
I'd like to take our pouch and I like to squeeze on a little squiggly drizzle on each fry.

49:32.760 --> 49:37.320
And soggy fries don't make for a very good eating experience when you try to do that.

49:38.280 --> 49:41.240
Using fries that they created are perfect for this.

49:41.880 --> 49:46.760
So if you include the delivery expectation of 20 minutes, typically 20 to 30 minutes,

49:46.760 --> 49:50.280
they're still crispy, which is mind boggling.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.560
It's the mind.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.560
The mind cannot conceive of the crispy.

49:55.560 --> 49:56.520
The mind cannot conceive of the crispy.

49:56.520 --> 49:57.560
Hey, can I say something?

49:57.560 --> 50:08.360
It is a razor thin margin between pleasantly floppy and way too crunchy for fast food french fries.

50:08.360 --> 50:14.120
The way this man is speaking makes me think that these are going to shatter my jaw bones.

50:14.120 --> 50:15.320
Oh yeah, baby.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.320
So fucking crispy.

50:17.320 --> 50:19.560
And they're heated internally, I guess.

50:19.560 --> 50:22.760
Like those like hand warmers that you crunch up and then put in your gloves.

50:23.320 --> 50:28.760
There's some kind of chemical activation from inside of them that 25 minutes later,

50:28.760 --> 50:30.440
they're still warm.

50:32.680 --> 50:34.040
I don't want you to go back.

50:34.040 --> 50:36.840
Hey guys, no, guys, you have to keep pressing forward.

50:36.840 --> 50:39.880
This is a question you had a freight.

50:39.880 --> 50:42.120
I really, guys, I really don't know.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.480
Please don't ask me for context.

50:43.480 --> 50:47.800
I don't know what is what is happening in this specific part.

50:47.800 --> 50:53.480
OK, you had a phrase around the coding that was great that included the word whisper

50:54.360 --> 50:56.920
and that you didn't want it to have a barrier to the potato.

50:57.800 --> 51:00.120
Can you share just a little bit about that philosophy?

51:01.880 --> 51:03.560
The reason why the whisper came out.

51:03.560 --> 51:13.480
Yes, thank you so much for asking.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.000
I was hoping you would bring up the whisper.

51:15.000 --> 51:15.400
Thank you.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.000
Actually, that's so stupid of you.

51:17.000 --> 51:17.640
Yeah.

51:17.640 --> 51:21.800
The reason why the whisper came out was because there are a lot of our competitors

51:21.800 --> 51:25.160
and options that we could have looked at that had heavier battering.

51:25.160 --> 51:29.240
But the beauty of our research was that it told us something very clearly

51:29.240 --> 51:31.720
that consumers really know their French fries.

51:31.720 --> 51:33.160
I love the French fry.

51:33.160 --> 51:35.880
For the fact that it's natural sort of potato texture.

51:35.880 --> 51:39.320
They want with the very light contrast and texture crisp on the outside.

51:39.320 --> 51:42.680
Fluffy baked potato in the middle is how we always talk about it in our kitchens.

51:43.320 --> 51:47.480
You cannot do that if you start applying a whole bunch of batter,

51:47.480 --> 51:49.000
which may make it more crispy.

51:49.000 --> 51:55.720
Yeah, but you end up changing the actual overall eating experience of the French fry.

51:55.720 --> 51:58.280
I know this gets deep into French fry.

51:58.280 --> 51:59.400
Does it, John?

51:59.400 --> 52:02.840
I know, but this is what we do.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.280
We talk about French fries like this.

52:04.280 --> 52:09.320
If you bite into a heavily battered product, I guarantee, I guarantee fucking tea.

52:09.320 --> 52:11.480
It says, I guarantee fucking tea.

52:11.480 --> 52:16.280
They start to get gummy and they lose that baked potato fluffy texture in the center.

52:16.280 --> 52:19.560
Our research tells us most consumers that is not good.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.600
John, honey, please come to bed.

52:22.600 --> 52:25.240
You've been up for days.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.640
John, please, the children miss you.

52:27.640 --> 52:28.280
Come home.

52:28.280 --> 52:32.440
But Mr. Lee, why should they not be married?

52:40.360 --> 52:41.000
Oh, sorry.

52:41.560 --> 52:42.280
Yeah, no, no, no.

52:43.000 --> 52:43.640
I love her.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.040
I love her or something.

52:48.040 --> 52:49.400
Anyways, potatoes to all.

52:50.440 --> 52:51.240
I've got to be off.

52:52.360 --> 52:57.960
The change is in regards to the actual battering process that we use.

52:57.960 --> 53:00.760
And finding the right level batter, which sounds like it's easy.

53:00.760 --> 53:01.000
No.

53:01.800 --> 53:05.400
Try doing millions and millions of pounds of French fries.

53:05.400 --> 53:07.000
There's a lot of science involved.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.360
Please, Mr. Lee, calm down.

53:08.360 --> 53:09.640
Please put the knife away.

53:10.280 --> 53:11.960
There's a lot of engineering.

53:11.960 --> 53:13.160
So we had to get it just right.

53:13.160 --> 53:14.280
You think you could do it?

53:16.600 --> 53:17.640
Oh, John.

53:19.400 --> 53:24.760
This is truly the combination of our own science on a product that seems so simple when you

53:24.760 --> 53:27.080
compare it to something that looks more complex.

53:27.080 --> 53:33.080
It's actually probably the most complex project that I've worked on in my entire career.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.000
It fucking sounds like it.

53:35.720 --> 53:36.920
It sounds like it, John.

53:36.920 --> 53:41.240
And I love, John, can I say we've been having a lot of fun here on our comedy podcast,

53:41.240 --> 53:42.280
but I love the passion.

53:42.280 --> 53:42.600
I love it.

53:43.560 --> 53:46.840
I love the passion, you ketchup, you fucking ketchup eater.

53:46.840 --> 53:50.680
The only thing that makes me sad about this now that I think about it is how much passion

53:50.680 --> 53:55.160
and love John Lee has put into these French fries and how most fucking plebs are going

53:55.160 --> 53:57.320
to take a bite of it and go, that's pretty good.

53:57.320 --> 53:58.760
And they're not going to appreciate-

53:58.760 --> 54:00.440
They're not going to appreciate about it.

54:00.440 --> 54:04.040
You know what else tickles me is that this recipe is being rolled out and should be in

54:04.040 --> 54:05.640
all Wendy's by mid-October.

54:06.440 --> 54:11.960
I think that you should, in the future, not denigrate your current product while you still

54:11.960 --> 54:13.800
have apparently so much of it.

54:14.600 --> 54:19.480
I feel like people should just show up because now if you think I'm going to go to a Wendy's

54:19.480 --> 54:27.160
place before this new incredible fry is available, you see people go for it two to one at McDonald's.

54:27.160 --> 54:30.280
I'm not going to waste a trip to Wendy's right now when you're still serving that garbage

54:30.280 --> 54:30.600
fry.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.960
This is your last chance to stock up.

54:32.760 --> 54:37.320
Let me get a Baconator combo meal, but just keep the French fries because I wouldn't eat

54:37.320 --> 54:40.280
that fucking shit with my worst enemy's mouth.

54:40.280 --> 54:44.040
Could I get an IOU for the French fries that I can turn in in mid-October?

54:45.080 --> 54:49.000
Actually, just take the French fries and pull out your waistband like a silly clown and

54:49.000 --> 54:50.520
put them down your pants because you're a clown.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:51.400 --> 54:53.720
And dance and say I'm a bad fry clown boy.

54:53.720 --> 54:54.760
Thank you.

54:54.760 --> 54:55.320
Thank you.

54:56.120 --> 54:56.520
Perfect.

54:56.520 --> 54:58.760
Oh, is it too late to order a small Frosty?

55:01.240 --> 55:02.840
I bet they are going to be pretty good though.

55:02.840 --> 55:03.880
Oh, yeah, sounds great.

55:03.880 --> 55:04.760
No, they're going to be great.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.200
They know what they're professionals.

55:06.200 --> 55:07.720
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.480
We hope you're going to rush out and get some of those Wendy's fries.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.680
They did not pay us to say that.

55:12.680 --> 55:13.800
Start waiting now.

55:13.800 --> 55:14.520
You got about-

55:14.520 --> 55:15.240
Start waiting now.

55:15.240 --> 55:15.720
45 days.

55:15.720 --> 55:17.080
Don't get any fries.

55:17.080 --> 55:17.400
Don't.

55:17.400 --> 55:19.800
Yeah, you know, fall's just around the corner.

55:19.800 --> 55:24.600
So, you know, do you got any questions for Richard Stank?

55:24.600 --> 55:25.240
He's going to be-

55:25.240 --> 55:25.880
Fuck.

55:25.880 --> 55:29.240
You know, the new season means a new visit from Richard Stank.

55:29.240 --> 55:33.480
So if you got questions about fragrance, you know, please be sure to pass those along.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.560
Hey, we have some really exciting news.

55:35.560 --> 55:39.160
We're doing a My Brother, My Brother and Me Live and Virtual September 24th.

55:39.800 --> 55:40.920
Take that, Eric Clapton.

55:40.920 --> 55:41.400
Yeah.

55:41.400 --> 55:46.040
It's going to start at 9pm Eastern time with Sawbones opening, which is very exciting.

55:46.040 --> 55:52.040
Tickets are on sale now for $10 at bit.ly slash mbmbamvirtual.

55:52.040 --> 55:55.640
And there will be video on demand available for that for two weeks after the show.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.880
So even if you can't make that time, go check it out.

55:57.880 --> 56:00.760
Bit.ly slash mbmbamvirtual.

56:00.760 --> 56:03.560
Also, we got new merch over at mcrorymerch.com.

56:03.560 --> 56:07.720
Our pin of the month is Dr. Shaq from Adventure Zone 813,

56:07.720 --> 56:11.960
which benefits the World Central Kitchen, which uses the power of food to nourish communities

56:11.960 --> 56:15.560
and strengthen economies through times of crisis and beyond.

56:15.560 --> 56:18.920
We've got a Phantom Seek Coast Co. pin, excuse me,

56:18.920 --> 56:23.880
and some Adventure Zone temporary tattoo flash sheets designed by Lynn Doyle

56:24.440 --> 56:27.000
and benefits the Asian Prisoner Support Committee,

56:27.000 --> 56:30.200
which provides direct support to Asian and Pacific Islander prisoners

56:30.200 --> 56:35.480
and to raise awareness about the growing number of APIs being imprisoned, detained and deported.

56:35.480 --> 56:39.400
Hey, thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with You.

56:40.200 --> 56:43.880
It's a jam, a bop, a slap, it rips completely and fully.

56:43.880 --> 56:44.440
It's a wiggler.

56:44.440 --> 56:47.240
Listen to the whole version of it now.

56:47.240 --> 56:53.240
Watch the music video that we participated in on the McElroy Family YouTube channel.

56:53.240 --> 56:54.440
And thank you, Montaigne.

56:54.440 --> 56:56.840
It's just, it brings me such joy.

56:58.680 --> 56:59.480
Is that it, though?

56:59.480 --> 57:00.440
Is that it for the show?

57:01.400 --> 57:03.720
I mean, you need to do your final yahoo.

57:04.440 --> 57:05.880
Yeah, no, I mean, other than that.

57:05.880 --> 57:06.920
You do a final yahoo.

57:06.920 --> 57:07.320
Yeah, sure.

57:07.320 --> 57:10.840
This one was sent in by Paul McCartney.

57:11.400 --> 57:12.120
Whoa!

57:12.120 --> 57:12.680
Whoa!

57:12.680 --> 57:14.520
Yeah, he listens.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.600
And he is really plugged into it.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.360
He's a very active yahoo user.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.520
He has 100,000 yahoo points.

57:21.880 --> 57:22.840
Thank you, Paul.

57:22.840 --> 57:23.400
Sir Paul.

57:24.120 --> 57:33.480
It's asked by yahoo answers user Tram-ter-kins, Tram-ter-kins.

57:34.280 --> 57:35.240
Tram-ter-kins, okay.

57:36.360 --> 57:40.600
And Tram-ter-kins asks, I'm thinking about

57:40.600 --> 57:45.400
starting a new.

57:45.400 --> 57:49.400
I'm thinking about starting a new.

57:52.760 --> 57:53.160
Hello.

57:55.960 --> 58:00.600
I'm thinking about starting a new.

58:05.640 --> 58:06.760
Just do it.

58:06.760 --> 58:08.040
Just read it.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.080
Off your screen.

58:09.080 --> 58:09.640
Sorry, guys.

58:09.640 --> 58:10.680
It's gotta, I gotta.

58:10.680 --> 58:11.960
You gotta scroll down.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.080
The fucking wire came loose.

58:13.080 --> 58:13.480
Hold on.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.640
Okay, here, it's loading now.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.000
Okay, good.

58:18.680 --> 58:19.560
Hello.

58:19.560 --> 58:20.680
Where do I start a new?

58:20.680 --> 58:21.480
Oh, never mind.

58:21.480 --> 58:22.920
I have a different question.

58:22.920 --> 58:26.520
Where can I download the all nude episode of According to Jim?

58:38.520 --> 58:39.560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:39.560 --> 58:41.160
This has been my brother, my brother.

58:41.160 --> 59:09.960
May I kiss your dad's square on the lips?

59:12.120 --> 59:13.400
It's better with you.

59:16.120 --> 59:17.880
