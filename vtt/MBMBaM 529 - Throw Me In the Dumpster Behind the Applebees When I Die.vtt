00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.880
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the Modron Era.

00:48.880 --> 00:54.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.000 --> 01:05.440
I'm Griffin McElroy, and it's Are You Guys in the Spirit of Spirits?

01:07.280 --> 01:08.320
What do you mean?

01:08.320 --> 01:13.920
Are you guys in it? Are you guys feeling these Jack O'Lantern vibes, baby?

01:17.600 --> 01:21.040
Don't look right at the full moon, or else you'll turn right into a werewolf.

01:21.040 --> 01:21.520
Here they come.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.800
I don't think that's how that works.

01:22.800 --> 01:28.080
The dead are coming, and they're gonna fucking kill us.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.520
Yeah, man, there's fucking skeletons and zombies,

01:33.520 --> 01:37.360
and they're gonna climb out of their graves, and they're gonna beat us down, baby.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.680
Griffin, can I stop you real quick?

01:39.680 --> 01:40.560
Yeah, please.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.360
I don't see what this has to do with War with Grandpa.

01:45.360 --> 01:50.720
We're doing a quick delay on talking about War with Grandpa anymore that we have already.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.080
Okay, we'll get back to it though, right?

01:52.080 --> 01:56.480
We'll file that one in with the Star Wars live show

01:57.200 --> 02:02.800
in a folder that is called The McElroy Brothers Continue to Forget

02:02.800 --> 02:06.560
to Not Talk About One Film or Film Franchise for a Whole Episode,

02:06.560 --> 02:07.920
because some people don't like that.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.520
Can I say one thing about War with Grandpa?

02:11.520 --> 02:12.160
Yeah, please.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.160
I want to get back in the spirit of spirits for how long I can go on.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.760
I just want to say one thing.

02:17.760 --> 02:22.960
We got a friend forwarded us a review, they called it an interview,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.240
where they offer an interview, basically, with one of the producers of the film.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.560
But I did want to share this one line from this thing.

02:32.560 --> 02:37.360
It said, it'll be one of the first family films to go into theaters this fall,

02:37.360 --> 02:38.400
following the pandemic.

02:39.600 --> 02:45.200
Imagine my relief that this fall will be following the pandemic,

02:45.200 --> 02:47.200
instead of right the fuck in the middle of it.

02:47.200 --> 02:47.760
Yeah, okay.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.080
So anyway, there's a skeleton that has two knives.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.880
And there's actually, did I say one skeleton?

02:52.880 --> 02:53.920
Because there's many skeletons.

02:53.920 --> 02:54.960
I'm trying to get everybody scared.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.480
Is this, okay, I roll perception to see if there's any sort of-

02:58.480 --> 02:59.120
No, we're not doing that.

02:59.120 --> 02:59.760
We're not doing that.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.720
We're not doing that.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.960
But they are coming and they do have knives.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.320
And I want everyone to get scared because I feel like it's late September

03:06.320 --> 03:07.840
and I'm not even feeling the-

03:09.120 --> 03:10.720
You're not feeling scared?

03:10.720 --> 03:11.280
You're not?

03:11.280 --> 03:11.600
Whoa.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.280
Oh, well, okay, I feel very, very scared about everything but Halloween.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.320
Okay.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.440
And I have been, I've been getting in the mood.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.480
Yeah, Howard, tell me.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.560
Or as one might say, the boo-d.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.280
Yeah, one might say that.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.680
One could say anything.

03:30.960 --> 03:35.360
Yeah, I have been drinking that hot apple cider.

03:35.360 --> 03:35.760
That's not very sweet.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.320
Enjoying a pumpkin spice latte under a warm afghan blanket.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.280
Yeah.

03:41.280 --> 03:46.480
And I have just been sitting by the fire and reading Chaucer.

03:47.920 --> 03:48.400
Chaucer, huh?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.520
Chaucer's the scariest.

03:49.520 --> 03:56.960
Yeah, I was reading some Chaucer, his classic tales about Canterbury.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.800
And by Chaucer, do you mean chooser?

04:00.800 --> 04:02.720
Like a werewolf chewing on your bones?

04:03.440 --> 04:07.520
No, I mean like the guy from Knight's Tale.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.120
I love him.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.680
I've been going to the park and yelling,

04:11.680 --> 04:13.040
somebody chase me!

04:13.040 --> 04:15.840
And waiting to get chased in the nighttime.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.000
Now, I've been chased by a werewolf before, Griffin.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.960
It's not funny.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.640
It's not fun or funny.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.960
Well, no, but yours was a real werewolf attack.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.880
Mine is for Halloween fun.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.800
Justin, how have you been getting scared and really scared?

04:28.800 --> 04:31.520
I just put up our inflatables.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.560
Oh, fuck yeah.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.160
Give us the rundown, baby.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.400
What are we working with in the McElroy front yard this year?

04:38.400 --> 04:40.000
Oh, I don't want to tell you.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.800
I don't want to get doxxed, but I did buy-

04:42.800 --> 04:43.840
That's fair.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.560
That's fair.

04:44.560 --> 04:49.280
I did buy a, you know, the little kid Sam from Trick or Treat?

04:49.280 --> 04:49.520
Yeah.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.880
You know, the little pumpkin-headed boy?

04:50.880 --> 04:51.040
Yeah.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.000
Oh, sure.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.280
Got a mask of him.

04:55.280 --> 04:55.920
Fuck.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.400
Yeah, so that has been a lot of fun with the kids,

05:01.200 --> 05:04.720
just kind of keeping them on their fucking toes.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.200
Yeah.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.480
You want to keep your kids off the iPad, make them have one eye

05:09.360 --> 05:13.280
always on the lookout for Sam to come up and snatch them.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.680
Now, what I've done to get really in the mood is I've been setting up

05:17.680 --> 05:20.960
kind of scary, like, cardboard cutouts around the house.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.200
Mostly they're all Robert De Niro from Our With Grandpa.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.560
There's a couple of speglies.

05:26.560 --> 05:26.800
Stop.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.480
You can't say that anymore.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.840
You can't talk about it anymore.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.400
That cannot be a shorthand for comedy.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.040
That's fair.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.760
I made chocolate pumpkins with peanut butter in them.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.720
Not scary.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.360
Not funny.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.120
Well, why's it got to be scary?

05:39.120 --> 05:41.840
You know, I enjoy, I don't like the scary movies.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.600
The scariest movies I like to watch at Halloween,

05:46.880 --> 05:49.520
maybe Hocus Pocus if I'm feeling brave.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.040
Hocus Pocus is fucked up.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.200
Hocus Pocus is fucked up.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.200
That cat suffers a fate worse than death.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.200
So does the zombie man.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.480
First five minutes, little girl dies.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.520
First five minutes.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.400
This is the price of admission.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.360
It is a Disney movie, isn't it?

06:07.360 --> 06:07.760
It is.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.960
Family member gotta die.

06:08.960 --> 06:09.760
Gotta die.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.320
I've been struggling even with my costume.

06:12.320 --> 06:16.000
And usually I have that ironed out by fucking April.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.680
But this year it's like what sort of topical,

06:20.400 --> 06:22.400
like, you know, pun or play on words

06:22.400 --> 06:26.800
or funny or reverent thing, like, can you even do for 2020?

06:26.800 --> 06:29.040
I do want to make an announcement along these lines.

06:29.040 --> 06:33.200
We had a press release come out two days ago from Yandy.

06:34.320 --> 06:37.840
If you don't know Yandy, they have in the past couple years

06:39.280 --> 06:40.640
gotten in a little hot water,

06:41.440 --> 06:45.840
but with no, they do a sexy fake news costume.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.080
Okay.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.640
And a sexy Handmaid's Tale costume, which was less,

06:51.280 --> 06:52.320
that one was tough.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.520
Misses the mark a bit.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.000
Yeah, a swing and a miss.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.880
Yes, that one was controversial, but they have announced

07:00.880 --> 07:05.280
that they will not, not be making a sexy COVID.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.120
Wow, Yandy.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.640
So this, this one's off the table, huh?

07:10.640 --> 07:13.760
This one, no sexy COVID.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.240
Just straight down the middle COVID.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.920
No, no COVID in this one.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.520
Let me just, I'm just going to say COVID de Kovny.

07:23.520 --> 07:29.280
A representative for the company for Yandy said,

07:29.280 --> 07:32.720
quote, I don't think there's anything sexy about it.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.120
Yeah, no, there's probably not.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.320
Yeah, yeah.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.400
I'm still going to go trick or treating.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.440
That's all I know.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.880
I love them tiny Milky Ways.

07:40.880 --> 07:41.520
You know what I mean?

07:41.520 --> 07:42.000
Like-

07:42.000 --> 07:43.680
No, you're actually not going to do that.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.240
What?

07:44.240 --> 07:47.600
But I, but I love those tiny Milky Ways, Justin.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.800
He has to get them.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.120
Where am I supposed to get my tiny Milky Ways from?

07:51.120 --> 07:54.720
If he doesn't get them, Justin, he turns into a big cartoon wolf.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.320
You remember, you've seen that.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.840
I chased you that one time.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.840
You've seen him mask out, like the mask.

08:00.400 --> 08:00.640
Yeah.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.080
And he freaks the fuck out if he doesn't get his little Milky Ways.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.360
Because I didn't have my tiny Milky Ways.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.120
Yeah, they call them-

08:05.120 --> 08:07.200
Don't try to get me big Milky Ways chopped up.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.800
I can see right through that shit.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.640
They call them fun size, but for Travis,

08:10.640 --> 08:13.600
they should call them like necessary, like medicine size.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.100
Yeah.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.520
I don't think there's anything sexy about COVID.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.080
I agree.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.080
I received an email invitation for an event yesterday called Dinner at Dan's.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.960
The email was likely not meant for me.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
As I know, there is someone else in my state who has the exact same email as me,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.400
but with the at Yahoo instead of at Gmail.

08:33.040 --> 08:36.080
You are the superior Dan, I will say.

08:37.200 --> 08:41.280
The invitation contained a Zoom link to the event next week.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.520
The only other guest on the invitation is Dan.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.120
And when I assumed to be his spouse, I know the invite wasn't meant for me,

08:47.120 --> 08:48.880
but it's hard to make new friends these days.

08:48.880 --> 08:49.380
Yep.

08:49.380 --> 08:49.880
No.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.360
And I don't want to pass up an opportunity for human contact.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.680
How do I show up at this dinner without making it weird

08:55.680 --> 08:57.600
or immediately getting kicked out of the Zoom call?

08:57.600 --> 08:58.100
Can't.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.120
Well, hold on.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.400
Should I bring a virtual gift?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.240
That's from Lonely in Chicago.

09:02.240 --> 09:07.360
The event, P.S., is from 3 to 8 p.m., so it's a five-hour dinner.

09:07.360 --> 09:07.860
Good hang.

09:07.860 --> 09:08.360
Woof.

09:08.360 --> 09:09.360
Cool hang.

09:09.360 --> 09:09.860
Cool hang.

09:09.860 --> 09:12.320
Wouldn't do that even if it was sent to me.

09:12.320 --> 09:19.840
Munchy, munchy, five hours on the phone watching the other person chew

09:19.840 --> 09:21.360
for at least half an minute.

09:21.360 --> 09:25.360
Do you think Dan would immediately kick them off the Zoom call?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.040
There'd have to be some time.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.880
It wouldn't just be like, boop, boop, boop.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.380
Ah, nope.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.480
Right?

09:30.480 --> 09:31.200
There would be some-

09:31.200 --> 09:32.160
Stranger got hacked.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.080
Hello?

09:34.080 --> 09:35.280
And you'd be like, hey, don't hang up.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.920
I'm your new friend.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.800
You couldn't even warm your way in.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.000
You say a gift, but you can't be like, oh, don't kick me out.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.760
I've got bruschetta just for me.

09:45.760 --> 09:46.960
Oh, I've got it.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.560
You get to watch me eat all this sloppy bruschetta.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.840
Here's what you do.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.040
Okay.

09:55.040 --> 09:59.200
Oh, my camera is not working, but it is me, your friend.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.840
Ask me anything that only Dan would know.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.040
Oh, fuck.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.640
Why did I say that?

10:04.640 --> 10:05.520
No, I don't know.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.160
Oh, fuck.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.240
I don't know anything that Dan knows.

10:08.240 --> 10:13.920
Now ask me something Dan wouldn't know, and I probably know it.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.440
Let me prove to you I'm not Dan.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.360
Partner, you can't do this.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.080
You can't, partner.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.880
Partner, you need to saddle on up from Mozi out of town.

10:22.880 --> 10:23.520
Partner, you can't.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.720
I hate texts.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.440
You can't do this, partner.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.400
You can't do this one.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.160
There's no way to do this one good.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.960
I do a weekly Zoom hangout with my friends here in town.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.800
Been doing it since March.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.440
It's a very great event for me.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.720
It lights up my life.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.440
And also last week during the call, I was like,

10:42.800 --> 10:46.160
man, this is too much human contact for me.

10:46.160 --> 10:52.400
The idea of entertaining a stranger as an online conference

10:52.400 --> 10:58.640
call hitchhiker is just completely non-viable for any living human being.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.400
Could you ask, I have one way it could work.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.040
This is one way it could possibly work.

11:05.040 --> 11:05.280
Okay.

11:05.280 --> 11:10.800
You forwarded it, you forwarded it to proper Dan.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.560
Yahoo, Dan.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.160
I think the party's at Dan's.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.840
Are they both Dan?

11:16.560 --> 11:17.520
What is happening here?

11:17.520 --> 11:19.760
I don't understand what is happening in this question anymore.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.520
No, no, Dan is the host of the dinner.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.720
It's dinner at Dan's.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.240
So Dan sent the invite to question asker.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.760
So the only other people on the invite are Dan.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.920
Are Dan and Dan's spouse.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.720
Okay, the other person, you send it to the other, the correct you.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.440
You're not Dan.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.800
The lonely in Chicago at yahoo.com.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.840
You send it to them and you're like, hey, I got this.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.600
I think it was, might've been meant for you.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.280
I've got some of your mail before.

11:50.160 --> 11:56.160
And this is gonna sound a little weird, but would you be willing to ask

11:56.160 --> 11:58.480
if I could also come along?

11:58.480 --> 11:59.120
There you go.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.160
Do you get a plus one?

12:00.160 --> 12:03.120
Do you get a plus, do you get a plus me?

12:03.840 --> 12:05.840
Cause that, cause we have the same name.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.560
So we're kind of the same person.

12:08.560 --> 12:12.320
I was technically, if you want to get like super, and I hate to be this guy,

12:12.320 --> 12:15.920
but if you want to get super technical, I was invited to it instead of you.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.800
So, and I'll be your wing man.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.680
If you're trying to hook up with Dan, I'm just telling you.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.960
Hey, is this a great idea?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.680
Let me know if this is a great and profitable idea.

12:25.680 --> 12:30.320
Cause I mentioned using, watch me eat bruschetta as a gift,

12:30.320 --> 12:35.360
but would it be cool if there were like entertainers you could hire

12:36.320 --> 12:39.200
for your Zoom hang to just like do some magic

12:39.200 --> 12:42.000
or play like a mariachi band or something like that

12:42.000 --> 12:45.920
while you and your friends played like Jackbox games or whatever the fuck.

12:45.920 --> 12:49.520
Griffin, you're a very innovative thinker, but there's no way that doesn't exist.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.440
We're six months into quarantine.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.800
You don't think someone's thought of, I will play music or do magic

12:54.800 --> 12:56.000
during your Zoom call?

12:57.200 --> 12:59.280
Not as a surprise.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.760
I mean, we've had a, we on this call have had a party with a princess.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.200
That's factual.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.200
Well, we have mostly for our children.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.480
Let's be clear.

13:08.480 --> 13:13.840
Family fun princesses hooked us up with a delightful princess encounter.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.320
Yeah.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.040
And by most of you-

13:15.040 --> 13:18.720
You know, BB's skill is like, hey, can we call Rapunzel back?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.760
And I'm like, oh, I think Rapunzel's pretty busy, buddy.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.600
She had such a good time with us,

13:23.600 --> 13:29.680
but I do like the idea though, if it's not an entertainer,

13:30.560 --> 13:34.240
but rather like just a bon vivant.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.200
Somebody who like-

13:35.200 --> 13:35.440
Oh, cool.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.880
Just somebody who's there to keep conversation sparkling.

13:38.880 --> 13:39.520
You know what I mean?

13:39.520 --> 13:43.760
Just so if there's a lull in it that you just have them sort of

13:44.480 --> 13:45.520
spice it up a little bit.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.360
That's French Michael, Michel.

13:47.360 --> 13:53.280
Ah, you know, your trip to Target reminds me of my trip to Monaco.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.200
He's not going to make it all about him.

13:57.200 --> 13:57.520
Oh.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.800
Michel is going to make it all about the party guests.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.400
He's making it special for them.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.040
Yeah.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.200
He's being fascinated by their tales.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.640
Everyone come listen.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.600
Pieter is telling me the most fascinating story.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.880
Now tell me, what did they do on Family Guy last evening?

14:14.880 --> 14:17.760
Gather, gather round.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.760
We're all on the same computer, Michel.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.560
I don't know how.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.000
Susan has the most wonderful Borat impression.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.680
You all must hear this.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.440
I've secretly asked-

14:29.440 --> 14:30.240
Go ahead, Susan.

14:30.240 --> 14:30.720
Do it.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.760
My wife.

14:31.760 --> 14:37.760
I've secretly asked all of you to tell me your heart's darkest desires.

14:37.760 --> 14:41.200
I held them on flash cards in front of me.

14:41.200 --> 14:47.920
I'm going to hold up each desire and I will ask you to guess which of our party guests

14:47.920 --> 14:54.720
gathered here tonight is the one with the most perverse, perverse urging.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.000
Also-

14:56.000 --> 14:58.400
Michel, I'd like you to go ahead and line up.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.640
Tonight, one of you will be murdered.

15:01.280 --> 15:01.920
What?

15:01.920 --> 15:03.840
It's not my thing.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.040
It's not part of this.

15:05.040 --> 15:05.920
I'm just letting-

15:05.920 --> 15:06.560
Warning.

15:06.560 --> 15:11.360
One of you is, just statistically speaking, one of you is going to be murdered tonight.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.000
That's the fucking thing, right?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.120
This is the thing.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.040
Oh my God, this is a billion dollar business.

15:17.760 --> 15:24.160
Zoom call with all your friends and a new friend of yours who they don't know.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.720
You guys have got to meet my friend, Michel.

15:27.440 --> 15:34.400
And Michel gets murdered 10 minutes in and then the murderer is sneaking around in the

15:34.400 --> 15:36.080
back and leaving clues and everything.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.400
And you got to solve the murder.

15:38.400 --> 15:43.520
Oh, that would be cool if you saw someone get murdered in your Zoom and then you watched

15:43.520 --> 15:49.600
the criminal just poke around and bumble around and maybe check out their Madden

15:49.600 --> 15:52.000
Ultimate team on their Xbox in the back.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.080
Hey, hey, put that down.

15:54.080 --> 15:58.160
That would be the fucking coolest juice of me and my eight friends, the only eight friends

15:58.160 --> 16:01.680
I have, watched someone get murdered and then yelled at the screen over and like,

16:01.680 --> 16:09.040
stop, don't murder him, no, get out of there, hey, get out of there.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.040
He was in the middle of a Madden game.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.600
But then the murderer would have the flashcards.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.640
Wait, now we're back to the perverse design of things?

16:18.640 --> 16:21.280
No, no, no, no, it's all connected.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.480
The murderer now has the flashcards that you gave Michel.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.400
So now you have to kill the murderer.

16:26.400 --> 16:31.680
Now, someone has to have the fucking guts to kill this guy.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.280
He knows too much.

16:33.280 --> 16:39.040
You're risking COVID and you're gonna have to murder a human being to protect everyone's

16:39.040 --> 16:39.840
dark secrets.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.800
So if Michel lives close to me, keep him talking, I'm not gonna go kill that guy.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.640
Nah, fuck that, watch this, bing-bong.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.040
I gave him a thumbs down emoji reaction.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.680
That's what I think, got it.

16:51.680 --> 16:56.320
I always feel like I have, I always say that I don't have any great ideas for stories.

16:56.320 --> 17:00.240
And I think it's because I waste them turning them into jokes.

17:00.240 --> 17:04.720
If I had said everything I said with a different tone of voice, I could have a hit film on

17:04.720 --> 17:05.600
my hands, I don't know.

17:07.840 --> 17:13.840
And also, by the way, this is, I understand, similar to the Shudder original host.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.680
But that, there's no flashcards and nobody named Michel.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.760
True, and we're not in it.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.320
And we're not in it and we're not profiting from its success.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.640
We would be in this as the three murderers.

17:24.640 --> 17:25.140
Okay.

17:27.280 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, Michel is very powerful and knows many martial arts, so he's able to defend himself.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.440
And I'm willing to be the one that Michel takes out before we can take him out.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.360
That would be cool to just watch two guys fight in your Zoom call.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.240
And one of them die.

17:40.800 --> 17:41.440
No.

17:41.440 --> 17:45.440
Okay, so here's a Yahoo that was sent in by several people, thank you.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.840
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user Robert.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.560
And Robert has this question.

17:52.560 --> 17:59.680
What would you do if someone offered you blueberries from their wicker basket, but when you looked

17:59.680 --> 18:02.640
inside, they were stones instead?

18:02.640 --> 18:03.280
Would you be mad?

18:04.240 --> 18:04.740
Huh.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.160
Well?

18:06.160 --> 18:09.840
Seems abstract, an abstract idea, but really close your eyes and...

18:09.840 --> 18:11.440
Okay, I'm imagining it.

18:11.440 --> 18:11.760
Okay.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.480
Walk me through.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.720
Well, you're walking down a rural road.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.640
Why's it gotta be rural?

18:16.640 --> 18:22.880
Why's it gotta be rural? Because I don't think people are selling basket fulls of blueberries.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.240
Farmer's market, asshole.

18:25.680 --> 18:30.560
I doubt, like a mobile farmer's market where somebody's just like, hey, you got blueberries

18:30.560 --> 18:30.880
here.

18:30.880 --> 18:36.240
Well, they shut off the ends of the street, there was a farmer's market, they bought the

18:36.240 --> 18:40.080
blueberries, now they're walking home from the farmer's market, and then they're gonna

18:40.080 --> 18:40.560
give them to me.

18:40.560 --> 18:44.160
Okay, in my fucking scene, it's a rural countryside.

18:44.160 --> 18:44.800
That makes more sense.

18:44.800 --> 18:52.080
And you're walking down and let's say, let me face cast this person.

18:52.080 --> 18:57.360
Teri Hatcher is walking down the road with a wicker basket full of blueberries.

18:57.360 --> 19:01.920
It's not really Teri, like if you saw Teri Hatcher, you'd be like, oh fuck, is that Teri

19:01.920 --> 19:02.400
Hatcher?

19:03.120 --> 19:05.920
But this is not Lois Lane, this is-

19:05.920 --> 19:09.600
So it's not Teri Hatcher, just looks like Teri Hatcher.

19:09.600 --> 19:16.880
And she has a shawl that is covering her, and she comes up and says-

19:16.880 --> 19:18.400
Then how do I know it's Teri Hatcher?

19:18.960 --> 19:20.000
It's not, you don't know it's-

19:21.280 --> 19:25.920
This is a blueberry vendor, that's all that you know because she walks up to you and says,

19:25.920 --> 19:30.160
buy mine bloonberry, buy mine bloon, that's hard to say.

19:30.720 --> 19:35.200
Buy mine blueberries for, they have antioxidants.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.200
And then you are like, fuck yeah, I could use some antioxidants.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.760
My blood is rotten, and you look inside of it and it stones.

19:44.640 --> 19:44.880
Small size.

19:44.880 --> 19:45.920
Then I wouldn't buy them.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.320
Yeah, I wouldn't buy the small size.

19:48.320 --> 19:52.000
How sincere is she in her belief that they are blueberries?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.800
Also, wait, is she escaping in a hot air balloon?

19:54.800 --> 19:55.680
Good question.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.040
Not yet, not yet.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.040
But that is gonna happen at the end.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.800
How serious is she about that?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.960
Is she like, I got you, are you punked?

20:03.760 --> 20:04.880
Dead fucking serious.

20:04.880 --> 20:10.080
Listen, unless you guys have psychic mind reading abilities,

20:10.080 --> 20:15.600
you don't really know firmly how much she believes in her own little game here.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.880
Okay, well then let's play it out.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.680
Teri Hatcher, these aren't blueberries.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.920
I'm not Teri Hatcher.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.240
What?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.960
I thought you were Teri Hatcher and these were blueberries,

20:24.960 --> 20:26.880
but you're not Teri Hatcher and the Rocks.

20:26.880 --> 20:27.680
What's going on?

20:28.240 --> 20:30.240
Am I in vanilla sky?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.800
She no longer looks like Teri Hatcher.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.760
Who does she look like now?

20:33.760 --> 20:37.200
Now, her face morphs into a mask of pain.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.040
Teri Hatcher can feel pain.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.960
Wait, you're right.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.520
I feel like if someone walked up to you guys on the street and said,

20:47.520 --> 20:51.120
hey, got some blueberries, choc-a-block full of anti-oxo dance.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.440
You guys would, and then you look down and there were stones in the basket.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.440
You would do something, but you're really fucking leaving me out.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.280
You're really hanging me out to dry right.

21:01.280 --> 21:05.120
If it was me, I would actually probably take one from the basket,

21:05.120 --> 21:08.400
convince I was wrong if there were stones and probably attempted to eat one.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.160
That is literally what I would probably do.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.920
Justin got his right.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.920
I would not be interested because if a human being walked up to me

21:15.920 --> 21:20.640
out of nowhere and offered me any kind of food, I would not be interested.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.120
Yeah, that's fair in these times.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.120
I mean, it's just a fit, right?

21:25.120 --> 21:28.160
If someone's like, hey, take some of this food.

21:28.160 --> 21:33.280
I come from a generation where I was told that people put razor blades and apples and shit.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.680
I'm not going to eat your stone blueberries.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.840
I wouldn't even need them to get that far.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.520
So while consuming is my anxiety,

21:39.520 --> 21:42.640
if I see somebody on the street with a wicker basket and they look at me

21:42.640 --> 21:48.560
and they start to raise their hand and get through like, hey, I'm gone.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.160
I assume that basket's full of snakes.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.200
No, it could be full of blueberries for all I care,

21:53.200 --> 21:56.720
but having to talk to a stranger about their wonderful produce

21:56.720 --> 21:58.400
is a little bit more than this guy can handle.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.960
But if they were stones, there's a story there.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.880
Are they pretty stones?

22:05.440 --> 22:06.320
They are blueberry.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.800
I will give this to Terry Hatcher.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.400
They are perfectly blueberry sized.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.160
Are they blueberry colored?

22:12.160 --> 22:13.360
Yeah, that's a good question.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.320
Um, no.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.600
Huh, so they're just like gray?

22:17.600 --> 22:18.800
Grayish, yeah.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.040
But are they round like blueberries?

22:21.040 --> 22:24.000
I'm saying these things are fucking perfect replicas of blueberries.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.480
So they're like 3D printed?

22:26.480 --> 22:26.800
Yeah.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.920
Also, this Terry Hatcher would be fucking jacked

22:29.920 --> 22:33.840
because this big basket full of stones would be heavy, I bet.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.360
I would actually rather take a rock from someone than food.

22:38.160 --> 22:38.720
That's good.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.000
Because then I'm lightening their load.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.480
You know what I mean?

22:42.480 --> 22:43.840
Oh, that's beautiful.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.080
What if we take a load off Terry?

22:47.840 --> 22:48.960
Take a load free.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.240
Take a bloob for free.

22:52.000 --> 22:52.800
Because then think about it,

22:52.800 --> 22:56.240
it's like we're all carrying around wicker baskets of bloob.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.480
Blueberry shaped stones.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.280
And if everybody would just take one stone from each other,

23:02.080 --> 23:02.960
we could all share.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.440
Picture 10 people, Griffin.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.760
Nine of them are Terry Hatcher and one of them isn't.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.800
And the one that's not has a wicker basket full of stones.

23:10.800 --> 23:14.480
And the other nine who are Terry Hatcher don't have any stones.

23:14.480 --> 23:18.320
Now imagine how much easier it would be for non-Terry Hatcher

23:18.320 --> 23:21.040
if those other nine people also carried some stones.

23:21.040 --> 23:21.920
You know what I mean?

23:21.920 --> 23:22.480
Yeah.

23:22.480 --> 23:26.640
And that is communism.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.400
I'm, I'll be honest, Trav.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.880
I've always wondered what that word means.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.760
Yeah, that's it.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.880
When nine Terry Hatchers help out one non-Terry Hatcher.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.200
Carry their stones.

23:37.200 --> 23:43.040
Is there a fruit that is more exciting to think about

23:43.040 --> 23:46.000
and see a big glistening basket of wet them

23:47.040 --> 23:50.800
than you eat one and you're like, ugh, than blueberries?

23:50.800 --> 23:51.280
No.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.800
Yeah, well, I would include,

23:53.440 --> 23:55.520
one I can think of would be all berries.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.360
Whoa, strawberries?

23:57.360 --> 23:59.520
You look at beautiful raspberry babies

23:59.520 --> 24:02.800
and they have the little tiny berries inside.

24:02.800 --> 24:03.200
Yes.

24:03.200 --> 24:03.920
Little nubbins.

24:03.920 --> 24:04.640
Yeah.

24:04.640 --> 24:08.160
And you pop one in your mouth and it's vulgar.

24:08.160 --> 24:08.400
Yeah.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.920
What's wrong with you?

24:09.920 --> 24:11.840
It's not sweet, not delicious.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.040
Raspberries is good.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.240
Strawberries is good.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.680
Blackberries, too much work.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.360
And figs.

24:18.400 --> 24:18.720
Come on.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.760
Figs need to stop.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.920
Do y'all know what figs do?

24:21.920 --> 24:24.480
Yeah, make people feel fancier about their bacon.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.120
Nah, I read this yesterday, it fucked me up.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.720
Cause I eat fig Newtons.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.400
Like I party on fig Newtons.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.400
I don't know that I've ever eaten a straight up fig

24:32.400 --> 24:33.520
and now I definitely won't

24:33.520 --> 24:36.880
cause there's wasps that pollinate them on the inside.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.760
So these dumb ass wasps, they crawl inside the fig

24:40.400 --> 24:42.800
and then if it's a boy fig,

24:42.800 --> 24:44.800
which I didn't know that that was a thing,

24:44.800 --> 24:47.760
then the wasp dies inside and their eggs come out

24:47.760 --> 24:51.920
and I guess wasp babies are like, cool, time to party.

24:51.920 --> 24:55.680
But then sometimes they'll climb inside of the girl fig

24:55.680 --> 24:58.720
and they can't pollinate that and so they just die

24:58.720 --> 25:00.640
and the fig turns them into more fig.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.080
Ah, so the fig wins.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.800
Isn't that fucked up?

25:06.800 --> 25:09.120
Wait, so you're saying fig Newtons is wasps?

25:09.920 --> 25:13.120
At some point in the process, you're eating a bit of wasp

25:13.120 --> 25:14.960
and the wasp is the worst animal.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.600
Hmm, huh.

25:18.640 --> 25:22.080
I'm gonna start calling figs wasp coffins

25:22.080 --> 25:23.840
and then we'll see wasp coffin Newtons

25:23.840 --> 25:25.520
and then we'll see if anybody eats these things.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.240
You know, I actually kind of would rather

25:28.240 --> 25:31.280
have a wasp coffin at Newton.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.640
Any other fruit jokes?

25:32.640 --> 25:33.920
Any other fruit jokes?

25:33.920 --> 25:36.720
Kiwis, kiwis, what's up with kiwis?

25:36.720 --> 25:38.640
Kiwis, they're furry, what's that about?

25:38.640 --> 25:43.600
They're furry, they might look like a nut, like a testicle.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.960
Oh, Griffin, that's vulgar.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.560
Apples, Granny Smith?

25:49.520 --> 25:53.200
No, man, my granny is named Donna, who's Smith.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.480
Nice, get them.

25:54.480 --> 25:54.720
Yeah.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.520
So that could be good?

25:56.080 --> 25:56.880
That's something.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.280
Bananas, oh, bananas are pretty,

25:59.280 --> 26:01.920
there's a lot to work with there, isn't there?

26:01.920 --> 26:02.720
Why?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.440
Kirk Cameron.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.000
The shape.

26:04.640 --> 26:04.880
Oh.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.040
The shape.

26:07.040 --> 26:07.760
Kirk Cameron.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.760
But they're just like what, like a smile?

26:09.760 --> 26:12.880
No, it's like a, like a pee-pee.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.240
Your penis looks like a banana?

26:16.880 --> 26:18.640
Jesus Christ, go to a doctor.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.800
We're all having fun here.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.320
My penis does have a stem, though.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.400
Oh, God, Griffin, wait, at what end?

26:26.400 --> 26:27.200
Hey, hold on.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.440
What's the one right, it's the end right above the candle.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.380
What?

26:34.800 --> 26:35.360
You heard it.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.120
That was you.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.920
I don't think anybody's confused about what's been happening here.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.480
Grapes, I can do a fun thing with grapes, where I put them up in my lips,

26:42.480 --> 26:45.440
and it makes it look like I'm a, like I have buck teeth, like a beaver.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.280
But you obviously can't see that at home.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.480
I recently moved and transferred to-

26:50.480 --> 26:52.080
Gallagher's got a lot of mileage out of watermelon,

26:52.080 --> 26:54.480
maybe there's some meat left on the bone.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.640
Here's the new rule, here's the new rule.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.920
If you're dangling, and I try to hand you a,

27:01.120 --> 27:04.960
or kind of a hanger, or, you know, they give,

27:04.960 --> 27:12.080
if I, listen, if I hand you a stool, and you're dangling,

27:12.080 --> 27:13.520
and you kick that stool away and say,

27:13.520 --> 27:17.040
I got one more bad thing to say, you don't get the stool again.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.000
You dangle.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.680
Do you think that there was ever like somebody who went to a Gallagher show?

27:22.240 --> 27:25.120
No one listening to this has ever heard of Gallagher.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.640
We would have more mileage talking about Frasier.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.520
What if Gallagher hit Frasier with a mallet?

27:31.520 --> 27:36.320
I recently moved and transferred to a new branch of the company I work for.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.600
Aside from the usual adjustments, it's, fuck.

27:41.520 --> 27:46.080
Aside from the usual adjustments, it's been a surprisingly smooth transition.

27:46.080 --> 27:50.000
However, one fellow employee constantly feels the need to throw fake punches

27:50.560 --> 27:53.920
accompanied by sound effects at me every time we run into each other.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.120
Fuck, cool, fuck.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.840
It's a restaurant, so this happens 20 to 30 times a day.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.560
Oh, boy.

27:58.560 --> 28:02.400
I'm fine with the horseplay, but after he's finished,

28:02.400 --> 28:05.040
he'll stop and look at me directly in the eyes

28:05.040 --> 28:07.920
as if he expects me to have a unique reaction every time.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.080
I've been doing fake grunts, oh my God.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.840
And I even pretended to wipe blood off my face a few times,

28:13.840 --> 28:17.360
but it's been over a month and I'm running out of steam.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.120
Help me, daunted and Dayton.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.560
Oh, boy.

28:20.560 --> 28:25.120
Can we not make it harder than it has to be?

28:25.120 --> 28:28.640
Can that be the 2021 slogan?

28:29.440 --> 28:30.880
Just stop making it harder.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.240
It's so hard already.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.760
It's so hard already on virtually every level.

28:35.760 --> 28:42.080
And there's people who have a tremendous amount of power and influence

28:42.080 --> 28:45.600
and they're using every inch of it to make it bad.

28:46.320 --> 28:51.760
They don't need our help to make it better with stuff like this.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.280
They simply do not.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.600
I don't know, it sounds like a fun little game to me.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.520
Now, okay, here's what you do.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.880
I'll solve it for you if you want.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.520
You want it fixed?

29:04.320 --> 29:05.040
I'll fix it.

29:07.360 --> 29:15.360
Just one time, lean in and force this person to punch you in the face.

29:15.360 --> 29:15.680
Yeah.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.240
Huh.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.920
At just when they're about to rear back for a big fake punch-o,

29:19.920 --> 29:23.840
you lean in real hard and get deck square in the jaw.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.480
End of game.

29:24.480 --> 29:24.720
Yeah.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.440
End of job for that person, I bet.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.800
No, you say, I'm not going to press job charges.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.400
They don't need to lose their job.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.000
You're not going to go to boss jail.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.680
No, I'm not pressing job charges.

29:39.680 --> 29:40.320
It's fine.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.840
Just don't pretend.

29:41.840 --> 29:42.640
I love the game.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.400
No, don't get me wrong.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.760
I love the game.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.360
You fucked it up.

29:48.080 --> 29:48.960
You fucked it up.

29:48.960 --> 29:49.760
You ruined it.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.280
And now the boss is on our case about it.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.880
What if you complained to your boss and there was a sign up?

29:57.520 --> 30:02.160
It's like, hey, no one in particular, but stop pretending to punch people.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.760
Well, I'll tell you the problem.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.480
The problem isn't so very physical.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.400
What if you pretend to poison each other?

30:09.440 --> 30:10.160
All right.

30:10.160 --> 30:10.640
All right.

30:10.640 --> 30:11.200
Yeah.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.280
Or you pretend to the eye of old age.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.480
That's cool too, Travis.

30:16.480 --> 30:21.200
Badass like fucking hand in hand and on two cots in the break room.

30:21.760 --> 30:22.400
That's awesome.

30:23.200 --> 30:23.920
Here's what you do.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.720
Next time he's taken some fake slings at you, you don't react.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.920
You stand there stone faced.

30:30.480 --> 30:34.240
And he's going to kind of pause and like, what has changed?

30:34.240 --> 30:37.440
And you're going to point to your completely empty wrist and say,

30:37.440 --> 30:39.200
I got this force field generator.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.320
And then you walk away.

30:40.960 --> 30:41.520
That's cool.

30:41.520 --> 30:42.080
Game.

30:42.080 --> 30:42.720
Game's over.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.840
And then if he's like, what's that?

30:45.840 --> 30:47.600
You say like, I can't hear you.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.960
Do I incredibly potent force field.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.480
And also I can't breathe through it.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.920
This is a venomous thing through it.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.560
So you have to free me.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.160
I'm going to pass away now.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.360
And I don't want to do it in front of you because it's embarrassing.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.040
I heard you poop yourself right there.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.000
A real boob.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.760
So I'm just going to climb in the dumpster.

31:09.760 --> 31:14.640
So I don't inconvenience anybody.

31:18.640 --> 31:24.640
Throw my dead ass body in the dumpster behind the Applebee's when I die.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.440
I don't want to be a burden to anyone.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.360
Don't go through the trouble.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.320
I know you're referencing the Joe Diffie track,

31:34.320 --> 31:36.080
prop me up beside the jukebox when I die.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.280
Joe Diffie did die this year.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.040
And I wonder if there was a moment

31:41.040 --> 31:44.000
where his loved ones looked around each other and were like,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.880
shit, so we're not, we're not going to.

31:46.880 --> 31:50.560
I probably forced a hard conversation with Willie Nelson's family

31:50.560 --> 31:52.880
when they were like, so is this a living will?

31:52.880 --> 31:55.600
Do we really have to roll you up and smoke you grandpa?

31:58.240 --> 32:01.040
Grandpa, I wicked don't want to smoke you grandpa.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.640
I love you so much.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.160
I love you so much grandpa.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.680
I don't want your dust getting all up in my lungs.

32:07.680 --> 32:12.000
Oh, anyway.

32:13.520 --> 32:18.480
Are we just going to be very tired until the episode after the election?

32:19.120 --> 32:19.920
I'm not tired.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.840
I'm just getting warmed up.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.040
I just have a cold sore on my lip.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.560
It's making it difficult for me to bring some of my choice characters.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.520
You know, Mr. F, the guy who only makes F sounds.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.720
I can't even do that character right now because this cold sore is so bad.

32:32.720 --> 32:33.200
It sucks.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.520
Anyway, you guys do the money zone because my lips hurt.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.800
Trav, you like to do this one.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.040
I'm not going to take that from you.

32:51.040 --> 32:51.680
Yeah, you do.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.640
You like them.

32:52.640 --> 32:53.520
Okay, here we go.

32:54.320 --> 33:00.160
Honey, shopping online is hard.

33:00.160 --> 33:08.400
You are my integrated app.

33:08.400 --> 33:08.800
Yeah.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.680
And you save me lots of bugs.

33:11.680 --> 33:11.920
Okay.

33:11.920 --> 33:12.960
Browser extension.

33:12.960 --> 33:17.200
Honey, you're a browser extension.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.440
Here's the fucking deal.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.400
You have this browser.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.520
And you save me lots of cash.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.520
I saved some cash over the weekend with this.

33:29.520 --> 33:36.080
That's, it's maybe not like the most sort of earth shattering endorsement,

33:36.080 --> 33:39.680
but I was shopping and I was about to buy a thing that was like 80 bucks.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.000
And then Honey bleeped in and Honey was like,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.280
oh, hold up, hold up, hold up.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.240
60, boop.

33:44.240 --> 33:44.800
Thanks, Honey.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.520
Whoa.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.400
Thanks for, I literally did nothing to earn that.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.920
But you did it for me.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.640
Thank you so much.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.960

34:08.160 --> 34:11.600

34:20.240 --> 34:21.920
That one doesn't work quite as good.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.720
Not quite as good.

34:22.720 --> 34:27.120
You can use any computer to print official US postage 24 seven

34:27.120 --> 34:30.960
for any letter, any package, any class of mail, anywhere you want to send.

34:30.960 --> 34:34.000
Then once your mail is ready, you just leave it for your mail carrier,

34:34.000 --> 34:35.920
schedule a pickup or drop it on mailbox.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.120
It's that simple.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.800
And with, what?

34:38.800 --> 34:39.040
You.

34:39.680 --> 34:40.800
What do you want to send Griffin?

34:42.240 --> 34:43.520
What do you want to mail today?

34:44.240 --> 34:47.600
I want to mail a letter.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.520
No, that's fine.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.000
That's fine.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.080
It might be, is it an important letter?

34:52.080 --> 34:53.600
It's from Justin to Kelly.

34:54.160 --> 34:54.880
Oh, okay.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.280

35:20.720 --> 35:22.080
It's, oh, sorry.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.280
Do you want to do one for Blue Apron?

35:23.280 --> 35:25.600
Oh, I love to eat.

35:25.600 --> 35:29.040
And there's no better way to eat than food that you made yourself.

35:31.840 --> 35:40.720
I, for instance, yes, last week, this previous week, enjoyed a sort of a ground beef

35:40.720 --> 35:45.200
with noodles and it sounded better when they put all the adjectives in there.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.560
I know I'm kind of making it sound like shift where D, but it was Blue Apron

35:48.560 --> 35:49.760
and I made it myself.

35:49.760 --> 35:55.280
Was it Blue Apron's yummy ground beef noodles?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.400
Oh, I love those.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.480
That's my favorite, Justin.

35:58.480 --> 36:02.640
Did it have some kind of sauce with it or is it just dry beef and dry noodles?

36:02.640 --> 36:05.360
Sometimes it's Romanesco, love that stuff.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.800
Chimichurri can't get enough.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.280
Pretty good.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.160
Did it come with any sides, Justin?

36:10.160 --> 36:12.160
Did it have a bit of vegetable with it?

36:13.200 --> 36:14.880
Oh, there's always a vegetable, which I love.

36:14.880 --> 36:19.440
I love that because I like to have a balanced meal.

36:21.280 --> 36:26.000
September, this month, I've enjoyed so many delicious recipes.

36:26.000 --> 36:26.720
Turkey burgers.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.440
Oh my God.

36:27.440 --> 36:30.400
I just remember turkey burgers with lemongrass and ginger in them.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.280
Are you kidding me?

36:31.920 --> 36:32.560
Shut up.

36:32.560 --> 36:37.040
And you can make it easily with just a few simple kitchen tools.

36:37.040 --> 36:41.680
You see pictures right there on the box and a recipe with photos.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.520
So you know exactly what you're doing.

36:43.520 --> 36:48.400
If you want to start cooking for yourself more, if you're tired of the carryout options

36:48.400 --> 36:53.600
around you and you want to try something different, this is the place to start with Blue Apron.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.320
This fall, don't settle for sameness.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.240
Change things up with Blue Apron's variety of delicious season-make recipes.

37:00.240 --> 37:04.640
Check out this week's menu and get $30 off across your first two deliveries

37:04.640 --> 37:07.520
when you visit blueapron.com slash my brother.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.920
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.960
Also blapron.com does still work.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.600
Blapron.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.080
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.760
They give you food.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.440
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.240
Oh, that was lazy.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.800
You got to cook it yourself.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.920
Hello there, ghouls and gals.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.920
It is I, April Wolf.

37:27.920 --> 37:32.880
I'm here to take you through the twisty, scary, heart-pounding world of genre cinema

37:32.880 --> 37:37.280
on the exhilarating program known as Switchblade Sisters.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.720
The concept is simple.

37:38.720 --> 37:43.360
I invite a female filmmaker on each week and we discuss their favorite genre film.

37:43.360 --> 37:48.400
Listen in closely to hear past guests like the Babadook director Jennifer Kent,

37:48.400 --> 37:51.040
Winter's Bone director Deborah Granik,

37:51.040 --> 37:55.040
and so many others every Thursday on maximumfun.org.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.200
Tune in if you dare.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.840
It's actually a very thought-provoking show that deeply explores the craft and philosophy

38:01.840 --> 38:05.040
behind the filmmaking process while also examining film through the lens of the female gaze.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.720
So, like, you should listen.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.520
Switchblade Sisters.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.360
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.320
My song wasn't done.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.160
It was.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.360
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

38:15.360 --> 38:15.600
Oh?

38:16.240 --> 38:19.840
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.880
I want to munch.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.000
Squad.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.920
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.920
I want to munch.

38:25.920 --> 38:26.720
Squad.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.280
Justin, you might need to have a word with your guitarist.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.960
He's kind of riffing a little there, stealing a little attention.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.200
He's in a different tuning.

38:35.200 --> 38:35.840
He's doing open D.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.040
He's trying to jaw focus.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.480
He's on that Nick Drake shit.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.520
He's in that Nick Drake open D beautiful.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.160
Okay.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.600
It's that drop D tuning.

38:44.640 --> 38:48.240
So listen, I got a few, like, just brief stories I want to share.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.200
Oh, this is nice.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.240
Yeah, just some brief stories.

38:52.240 --> 38:55.120
Tim Hortons is giving away pumpkins with beverage orders.

38:55.120 --> 39:00.960
If you're at a Tim Hortons in the US and you buy pumpkin spice beverage through the Tim

39:00.960 --> 39:04.480
Hortons app, when you go and pick it up,

39:04.480 --> 39:05.600
they're going to give you a pumpkin.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.600
Whether you want one or not.

39:07.600 --> 39:13.200
No matter what you do, if you get a pumpkin spice latte, a pumpkin spice ice cap, whatever,

39:13.760 --> 39:14.560
they don't care.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.840
They're going to put a pumpkin in your car.

39:15.840 --> 39:16.320
Wow.

39:16.320 --> 39:20.080
If you try to leave it in the restaurant, they will chase you through the parking lot

39:20.080 --> 39:22.320
with a pumpkin saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, your pumpkin.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.280
They will find you.

39:24.080 --> 39:27.520
If you go through the drive-thru and don't stop to get your pumpkin, when you get home,

39:27.520 --> 39:29.840
you're going to open the back door and there's the pumpkin.

39:29.840 --> 39:33.840
And you're going to throw that pumpkin in the fire, but then later tonight when you go to bed,

39:33.840 --> 39:38.400
you're going to pull back the covers and there's the pumpkin, brand new, whole, once again.

39:39.280 --> 39:44.000
You're going to make a wish and the pumpkin's going to rot before your very eyes in a matter

39:44.000 --> 39:44.480
of seconds.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.720
But be careful what you wish for because the pumpkin is very literal.

39:48.720 --> 39:48.960
Yeah.

39:50.720 --> 39:56.000
Next story from Joseph requires a little bit of cultural education.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.680
Do you know what Kraft Mac and Cheese is called in Canada?

39:59.680 --> 40:00.080
No.

40:00.080 --> 40:00.800
Kraft Dinner.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.680
Thank you, Travis.

40:03.680 --> 40:06.960
Pumpkin Spice KD is coming to Canada this fall.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.680
That's not my acronym.

40:09.680 --> 40:10.320
It's theirs.

40:11.440 --> 40:15.840
In one of the more unlikely partnerships of 2020, Kraft Dinner has announced they're unveiling

40:15.840 --> 40:17.040
Pumpkin Spice KD.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.240
Wait, what's the partnership?

40:18.240 --> 40:20.160
Kraft and Pumpkins?

40:20.880 --> 40:22.000
Kraft and Pumpkins.

40:23.840 --> 40:30.480
Hitting shelves in Canada this October, Pumpkin Spice KD is made with the same classic KD cheese

40:30.480 --> 40:35.600
powder Canadians know and love, as well as the addition of fall flavors, including hints

40:35.600 --> 40:38.160
of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.040
Ew.

40:41.040 --> 40:46.160
While some may feel the combination is not something they're interested in trying, others

40:46.160 --> 40:50.720
are, as Canadians have already begun signing up to try the new concoction.

40:50.720 --> 40:51.760
You have to sign up?

40:51.760 --> 41:01.040
Well, okay, Joseph, who sent this in to the Munch Squad tip line, said the cowards are

41:01.040 --> 41:02.960
only making a thousand boxes of the stuff.

41:03.600 --> 41:06.720
Someone from the company was on the radio saying they have a waitlist of over 10,000

41:06.720 --> 41:08.160
people waiting to try it.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.600
So I don't know.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.720
People are dying for it.

41:12.080 --> 41:12.800
Here's the quote.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.720
KD has always been known for one of a kind cheesy taste.

41:18.720 --> 41:24.000
And after years of watching Canadians get excited for Pumpkin Spice season, we felt

41:24.000 --> 41:28.640
that it was time to combine these two iconic flavors and create Pumpkin Spice KD.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.840
It was time to cash in.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.320
Cash in on the KD.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.040
This, this is good.

41:35.040 --> 41:40.800
Canadians have always made KD their own way, and not many people would expect KD to be

41:40.800 --> 41:44.480
part of the PSL conversation, but that's the whole point.

41:44.480 --> 41:45.280
What?

41:45.280 --> 41:45.840
Only one.

41:47.120 --> 41:47.680
You heard me.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.480
That's the whole point, because it's so wild.

41:51.520 --> 41:52.960
Only a thousand will be made.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.600
So move over lattes and muffins.

41:55.600 --> 41:59.760
PSKD is the new must try flavor this fall.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.720
This is vulgar.

42:02.720 --> 42:08.160
Maybe people will buy a box of it and they'll sell it on eBay for a lot of money.

42:09.360 --> 42:13.440
And then that song of I had a million dollars, we wouldn't have to eat Kraft Dinner, but

42:13.440 --> 42:19.280
we would finally be able to eat the Kraft Dinner that is seasoned with Pumpkin Spice.

42:19.280 --> 42:24.720
So this next to last story is one a lot of people sent in, and I just wanted to do it

42:24.720 --> 42:26.320
so I would stop getting emails about it.

42:27.520 --> 42:33.440
Red Lobster and PepsiCo have kicked off a new relationship with the Dew Garita, the

42:33.440 --> 42:35.120
first Mountain Dew cocktail.

42:35.120 --> 42:35.920
Finally.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.160
Why is Red Lobster the one?

42:38.160 --> 42:40.000
Why wouldn't Red Lobster be the one?

42:40.000 --> 42:44.080
Well, Griffin, Red Lobster and Pepsi have been dancing around each other for a while

42:44.080 --> 42:50.080
now, and we're all thinking time to just get to it and get to fucking, by which I mean

42:50.080 --> 42:54.800
create a Mountain Dew based cocktail that goes with any lobster based dish.

42:54.800 --> 42:55.520
Okay.

42:56.640 --> 43:00.480
I, this is the first, sorry, I should be clear.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.280
This is the first official Mountain Dew cocktail.

43:05.280 --> 43:09.760
See, because I know at least, for example, the first time I ever got drunk was on a

43:09.760 --> 43:15.440
cocktail I created made of Popov Vodka and Mountain Dew Code Red.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.800
So that might've been the, that was never adopted officially by the company.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.720
Halo juice is what you called it.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.000
Fucking landfill, baby.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.480
You can call it Code Red Square.

43:28.240 --> 43:29.440
That's actually not bad.

43:29.440 --> 43:35.680
Red Lobster and PepsiCo are teaming to create exciting new ways to enjoy great seafood.

43:35.680 --> 43:39.840
A long way, I guess you had to bring that yourself to the Red Lobster with the great

43:39.840 --> 43:41.760
taste and variety of PepsiCo products.

43:41.760 --> 43:46.320
The duo will leverage their iconic food and beverage brands to create a variety of craveable

43:46.320 --> 43:50.560
new menu items, starting with the Dewgarita, the first Mountain Dew cocktail.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.480
God help me, friends.

43:52.480 --> 43:56.800
If you wake up in the morning craving a Dewgarita, go back to bed.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.760
Try again tomorrow.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.280
Want something better.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.160
Want better.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.400
Dream bigger.

44:04.400 --> 44:04.900
Bigger.

44:06.240 --> 44:10.480
The Dewgarita pairs perfectly with Red Lobster's iconic cheddar bay biscuits.

44:10.480 --> 44:10.960
How's that?

44:10.960 --> 44:14.560
It's the new fucking official, official.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.360
My friends.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.720
Dirt, Dirt.

44:16.720 --> 44:20.880
It's the new official.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.800
My dear friends.

44:22.800 --> 44:27.360
It's the new official hor d'oeuvres for dirt bags.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.280
It's Dewgarita.

44:29.280 --> 44:33.280
Hey, I'm Travis McElroy representing Red Lobster for 2021.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.120
This year, we just skipped all the trouble.

44:35.120 --> 44:37.840
We soaked the cheddar bay biscuits in the Dewgarita.

44:37.840 --> 44:42.000
You can just pick yourself up a soaking wet cheddar bay biscuit,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.880
horse the whole thing down, get the job done right.

44:44.880 --> 44:49.360
If I was standing in an infinite warehouse with infinite type writers manned by infinite

44:49.360 --> 44:53.520
monkeys and I stood up front, I gave the prompt, okay, you silly guys.

44:55.040 --> 45:01.840
What beverage, what liquid, potable liquid on earth would you pair with Red Lobster's

45:01.840 --> 45:03.760
cheddar bay biscuits?

45:03.760 --> 45:09.600
Never, never would somebody be like, oh, I'm thinking the alcohol.

45:09.600 --> 45:14.080
So maybe a margarita, but instead of like the regular margarita stuff, a Mountain Dew

45:14.080 --> 45:19.120
mixed in there because that will contrast the notes of cheddar and bay and biscuit.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.360
It's fart cutery is what we call it.

45:23.360 --> 45:30.160
Made using a top secret recipe, this refreshingly fun cocktail will begin rolling out to select

45:30.160 --> 45:35.280
Red Lobster restaurants in September and will be available nationwide by the end of 2020,

45:35.280 --> 45:37.680
which is sounds more of a like a threat.

45:37.680 --> 45:42.400
The Red Lobster and PepsiCo innovation teams are quickly working together to leverage iconic

45:42.400 --> 45:49.840
PepsiCo brands across the Frito-Lay and Quaker range of products to create tasty menu items.

45:49.840 --> 45:54.240
Look forward to Wilford Brimley's Quaker Oatsquares old fashions.

45:54.240 --> 45:58.880
Oh, I like how you've dusted the rim.

46:01.600 --> 46:05.360
Fritosmopolitan, that's a cosmopolitan made with Fritos.

46:05.360 --> 46:09.920
If you guys have any others from the Frito-Lay family of products, please let me know.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.800
Fritosmopolitan, that's a Frito cosmopolitan.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.600
Sorry, you guys are lagging out.

46:17.600 --> 46:18.160
I'm not hearing the words.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.200
Mark Dorito.

46:20.240 --> 46:20.880
What's that?

46:20.880 --> 46:22.160
Oh, Mark Dorito.

46:22.160 --> 46:22.800
Okay, that's fine.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.120
We've actually already done a Mark Dorito one.

46:25.840 --> 46:30.160
Red Lobster guests will also be able to enjoy a broad range of beverages,

46:30.160 --> 46:38.160
a broad range of beverages from PepsiCo, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew,

46:40.000 --> 46:43.600
and stubborn craft soda, as well as bubbly sparkling water,

46:43.600 --> 46:50.080
Life Water, Tropicana, and non-carbonated options like lemonade and agua fresca.

46:50.080 --> 46:54.080
Hey, so you're just saying that you'll still have-

46:55.120 --> 46:59.360
So what they said in this paragraph is that this will not be the only drink-

46:59.360 --> 47:00.160
Don't you worry.

47:01.840 --> 47:06.480
If you choose to take the coward's way out, you don't have the drink the doogarita.

47:06.480 --> 47:09.200
Fucking red lobsters, the coward.

47:09.200 --> 47:15.520
If you're going to introduce a doogarita into your fucking lineup, make it mandatory, damn it.

47:15.520 --> 47:20.720
Hey, man, if you don't drink the doog, then you don't drink a red lobster.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.720
There's people out there who don't drink alcohol,

47:22.720 --> 47:24.640
there's people out there who don't drink Mountain Dew,

47:24.640 --> 47:28.480
and neither of those people are welcome at Red Lobster for the next couple months.

47:28.480 --> 47:31.520
So pull up to the trough, get yourself a drink,

47:32.240 --> 47:36.800
and over here, we just got a big pile of cheddar bay biscuits, tear in.

47:37.760 --> 47:42.080
If you are willingly eating inside of a red lobster,

47:42.080 --> 47:44.880
currently you should be forced to drink a doogarita.

47:44.880 --> 47:45.840
That should be good.

47:45.840 --> 47:48.640
That's good because it'll kill all the germs in your body.

47:48.640 --> 47:49.120
Sure.

47:49.120 --> 47:54.400
Red Lobster and PepsiCo, we found the vaccine, but the bad news is it's doogaritas.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.080
We can save them, but at what cost?

47:57.280 --> 47:58.320
I'm not sure.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.400
Gosh, let me think about it.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.440
Red Lobster and PepsiCo both understand how much food and beverages

48:03.440 --> 48:06.480
enhance memorable moments from casual gathering.

48:06.480 --> 48:10.800
Do you remember during COVID when we went and drank fucking doogaritas and got COVID there?

48:10.800 --> 48:12.080
That was so weird.

48:12.080 --> 48:16.000
But casually, so it's like, doesn't even count.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.480
With both our brands on deck to wow guests,

48:20.480 --> 48:23.840
we can't wait to dream up more phenomenal flavor pairings together

48:25.520 --> 48:28.800
to bring some very special offerings and experiences to the table.

48:32.080 --> 48:35.680
Red Lobster and PepsiCo also share a common passion for sustainability.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:38.160 --> 48:43.040
Create sustainability for everything other than the human race, sensibly.

48:43.840 --> 48:47.200
Aiming to create a more environmentally friendly experiences for guests.

48:47.200 --> 48:51.760
Both companies are partners with the Ocean Conservancy and Trash Free Seas Alliance.

48:51.760 --> 48:54.560
Trash Free Seas, Trash Full Red Lobsters.

48:54.560 --> 48:55.360
That's my motto.

48:55.360 --> 48:58.960
What we do is every time we harvest a Mountain Dew, we plant two more.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.080
Don't worry about it.

49:01.360 --> 49:05.440
Any trash that we find in your oceans, we just bring you straight into the restaurant

49:05.440 --> 49:07.520
and find out a way to make you into a margarita.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.920
Their relationship will leverage the goals of both companies

49:09.920 --> 49:14.400
to incorporate more sustainable packaging and distribution techniques of the future.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.640
I want my Dewgarita in a little plastic pouch

49:16.640 --> 49:18.560
like they used to put milk in in elementary school.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.480
They have to jab with a straw.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.680
That's how I want it.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.280
Just a big communal cup.

49:24.400 --> 49:28.000
Just get rid of the water in the tank with the lobsters in it that you pick,

49:28.000 --> 49:31.040
which one you want to eat and fill that with Dewgarita

49:31.040 --> 49:33.600
and then whatever you can scoop out of there with two hands.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.200
Put the lobsters back in because they'd want a party.

49:37.200 --> 49:37.840
Listen.

49:37.840 --> 49:40.560
And also because we can't have water in this building at all

49:40.560 --> 49:42.480
or else people are going to be tempted to drink it.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.720
Not a drop.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.600
Not a drop.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.120
Now, let me tell you, boys.

49:47.120 --> 49:50.720
I'm a simple man and I enjoy the simple pleasures.

49:50.720 --> 49:53.120
I've enjoyed shrimp.

49:54.480 --> 49:58.080
The endless shrimp is one of life's great joys as far as I'm concerned.

49:58.080 --> 50:00.560
I've enjoyed a red lobster before.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.760
First restaurant we ever took Charlie to,

50:03.760 --> 50:07.440
my first daughter was at the shrimp vortex of endless shrimp.

50:07.440 --> 50:08.320
That's true.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.160
I attempted to consume 100.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.760
I think I made it to 85.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.200
It was the worst day of my life.

50:13.200 --> 50:14.160
It was not great.

50:14.160 --> 50:17.920
But I enjoy a cheddar-baked biscuit.

50:17.920 --> 50:18.420
Sure.

50:20.160 --> 50:23.840
Worth is not the year of our Lord 2020

50:23.840 --> 50:26.640
and perhaps any other time in existence

50:26.640 --> 50:31.360
would I be tempted to attend a feast at Red Lobster

50:31.360 --> 50:33.440
and indulge perhaps in a Dewgarita.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.360
Why are you talking like this?

50:35.360 --> 50:39.040
Because I'm a classic boy who-

50:39.040 --> 50:40.800
You're a classic classy boy?

50:40.800 --> 50:42.080
Yeah.

50:42.080 --> 50:42.880
What the fuck?

50:44.080 --> 50:48.240
You were just speaking like an old English bard.

50:48.240 --> 50:48.480
Yep.

50:49.680 --> 50:55.760
That character went so hard in the paint for so long.

50:55.760 --> 50:57.920
That's a classy boy.

50:57.920 --> 50:58.640
There was a-

50:58.640 --> 51:03.040
It's such a thin sliver that people were probably listening like,

51:03.040 --> 51:04.640
this must be a reference to something.

51:05.760 --> 51:07.760
That's just one of those fancy lads

51:07.760 --> 51:10.960
that you see eating at Red Lobster any other time except now.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.840
But there had to be a point when you were saying all that stuff

51:13.840 --> 51:14.640
when you were like,

51:14.640 --> 51:18.640
man, I've been doing this wild voice for a long time

51:18.640 --> 51:20.240
and it doesn't make much sense,

51:20.240 --> 51:22.320
but I can't possibly stop now.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.680
Can I tell you what's weird, Griffin?

51:23.680 --> 51:23.920
Yeah.

51:23.920 --> 51:24.640
I didn't notice.

51:25.280 --> 51:25.520
You didn't notice?

51:25.520 --> 51:28.800
I wasn't so much doing the voice as the voice was doing me.

51:28.800 --> 51:29.600
Wow.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.720
Yeah, like I just became the classic classy boy.

51:32.720 --> 51:33.040
Yeah.

51:33.040 --> 51:36.240
And like, I don't know what to tell you.

51:36.240 --> 51:37.760
I feel like the voice did all of us.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.520
I recently made cheddar bay biscuits at home.

51:41.520 --> 51:42.320
Okay?

51:42.320 --> 51:42.960
Yeah.

51:42.960 --> 51:43.440
Yeah.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.760
Is that okay with you, Dad?

51:45.760 --> 51:48.160
I did that in cooking class in high school.

51:48.160 --> 51:48.560
It was-

51:49.120 --> 51:50.160
Yeah, they're easy.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.000
I ordered, can I tell you guys something?

51:54.000 --> 51:54.320
Yeah.

51:55.440 --> 51:57.440
We were talking about if we weren't in,

51:58.320 --> 51:59.120
I don't, there's actually-

51:59.120 --> 52:01.200
The year of our Lord 2020?

52:01.200 --> 52:02.480
Yeah.

52:02.480 --> 52:04.080
I ordered on eBay.

52:04.080 --> 52:07.760
I ordered, there's this new smart food popcorn

52:07.760 --> 52:09.680
that has Cap'n Crunch Berries in it.

52:09.680 --> 52:10.080
Okay.

52:10.080 --> 52:12.240
And I really wanted to try it

52:12.240 --> 52:15.600
because Dan, my co-host of my cereal podcast,

52:15.600 --> 52:16.880
The Empty Bowl, he had tried it.

52:16.880 --> 52:18.080
So I wanted to try it

52:18.080 --> 52:19.600
because I want to try everything that Dan tries.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.600
So I couldn't find it.

52:21.600 --> 52:22.640
Dan jumped off a bridge?

52:22.640 --> 52:23.680
Would you jump off a bridge?

52:26.240 --> 52:28.320
I mean, if you needed me to rescue him or something.

52:28.320 --> 52:29.120
No, it's bridge, Dan.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.680
I couldn't find them in stores

52:31.680 --> 52:34.720
because I don't really go to stores looking for popcorn.

52:34.720 --> 52:38.640
So I got some off eBay for three bags.

52:38.640 --> 52:41.360
I got some off eBay and they were shipped to my home.

52:42.080 --> 52:44.080
And when I opened them, there was,

52:44.880 --> 52:47.120
I just wanted to say there was a envelope

52:47.120 --> 52:49.040
and I opened the envelope

52:49.040 --> 52:52.160
and there was a handwritten thank you note inside

52:52.720 --> 52:55.680
that said, thank you for buying this popcorn.

52:55.680 --> 52:57.360
I hope you find it delicious.

52:57.360 --> 52:59.760
And also inside there were four baseball cards.

53:01.360 --> 53:02.640
I just thought that was so nice.

53:02.640 --> 53:04.320
I fucking love eBay bonuses.

53:05.040 --> 53:09.120
Yeah, just here's one thing I always do is baseball cards.

53:09.120 --> 53:10.160
So there's four baseball cards.

53:10.160 --> 53:11.200
Love the captain.

53:12.000 --> 53:12.720
That's awesome.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.200
Yeah, I just thought it was a nice little story.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.560
I wanted to share a little bright spot.

53:16.560 --> 53:16.800
All right.

53:16.800 --> 53:22.880
Yeah, I got some bottle caps in a toy that I found.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.920
I bought a toy and it came with bottle caps.

53:25.920 --> 53:28.080
And yeah, you can do a lot with those.

53:28.080 --> 53:31.360
Turn them into pins or caps-y.

53:31.360 --> 53:32.400
I like to fling them.

53:32.400 --> 53:35.120
You kind of put them between your thumb and your finger

53:35.120 --> 53:35.760
and you fling them.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.800
Can I do a quick Yahoo, please?

53:38.800 --> 53:39.360
I love that.

53:39.360 --> 53:39.760
Yes, please.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.160
It's sent in by Emma Cant.

53:42.160 --> 53:42.560
Thanks, Emma.

53:42.560 --> 53:44.960
It's Yahoo Answers user Drishti asks,

53:45.920 --> 53:51.600
hey guys, can somebody suggest me names

53:51.600 --> 53:55.600
for some grand mansion like Thornhill of Riverdale?

53:55.600 --> 53:56.080
Thanks.

53:56.080 --> 54:00.240
I'm now realizing that this is the name of a building

54:00.240 --> 54:02.880
or a state from the TV show Riverdale

54:02.880 --> 54:06.000
and that there's not a place in the earth

54:06.000 --> 54:08.400
called Thornhill of Riverdale.

54:09.440 --> 54:10.560
Or is there?

54:10.560 --> 54:11.360
Yeah, you don't know that.

54:11.360 --> 54:11.760
Could be.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.840
Here's the thing that I love about this.

54:13.840 --> 54:18.640
At some point, there are some fancy ass houses out there,

54:18.640 --> 54:20.800
you guys, with these fancy ass names.

54:20.800 --> 54:24.240
At some point, if you have a mansion called Thornhill,

54:24.240 --> 54:26.400
it didn't come with that name.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.240
Like somebody built this house and said,

54:28.240 --> 54:30.000
my house gets a name now.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.360
And I like that.

54:31.360 --> 54:32.800
I think we should do that more.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.240
I have a name for my house.

54:37.200 --> 54:38.320
I have a name for my house.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.840
I'm not going to dox myself.

54:39.840 --> 54:43.120
Well, my house name isn't registered anywhere, Justin.

54:43.120 --> 54:43.440
You can't.

54:43.440 --> 54:47.600
No, it's registered.

54:47.600 --> 54:48.800
You can name your house.

54:48.800 --> 54:50.000
It doesn't ever matter.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.200
You can always name your house.

54:51.200 --> 54:51.920
You should name me.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.840
Everybody should name your house right now.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.120
You don't live at an address.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.320
You live in a state.

54:56.320 --> 54:57.280
Just name your state.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.200
It's just about naming it.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.240
You can do whatever you want.

55:00.240 --> 55:00.880
All right.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.160
Let's just come up with some good, like,

55:04.080 --> 55:04.720
Riverdale.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.560
Feathertail.

55:06.560 --> 55:09.120
Are we just going to rhyme things with Riverdale?

55:09.120 --> 55:10.320
Because we could do that all day.

55:11.280 --> 55:11.840
Heathertail.

55:11.840 --> 55:12.640
Okay.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.480
Stratford upon Avon.

55:14.480 --> 55:15.600
Leather, Leatherwhale.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.240
Thistleclaw, Thistleclaw.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.320
Hey, are we doing warrior cat names?

55:20.320 --> 55:23.920
Just Justin.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.880
If you're Justin, if you're looking at a list of warrior cat names,

55:26.880 --> 55:28.240
you legally have to tell us.

55:28.880 --> 55:29.680
Ravenclaw.

55:29.680 --> 55:33.520
I'm saying it's another Graystripe of Huntington.

55:33.520 --> 55:36.720
I think what you should do, you should have more fun with it.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.600
Because you could do an old stuffy name, right?

55:39.600 --> 55:43.040
But you could also call it like Party Town, right?

55:43.040 --> 55:48.080
Or just like, you could just like termite damage, you know?

55:48.080 --> 55:49.680
Like have a fun name.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.440
No, it's got to be a compound word.

55:52.240 --> 55:52.720
It does?

55:52.720 --> 55:55.840
Okay, how about Batman.

55:56.400 --> 55:57.520
Batman.

55:57.520 --> 55:58.800
This is Batman the house.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.160
It's pretty moody in there.

56:03.120 --> 56:06.560
No theme whatsoever on the outside or the inside.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.000
This is my house Batman.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.520
It just has Batman energy.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.640
Big Batman energy.

56:11.440 --> 56:13.600
Just when I see it, I think Batman.

56:14.480 --> 56:15.440
See, you know what sucks?

56:15.440 --> 56:18.240
Is a really cool name for a house is Brookstone.

56:18.240 --> 56:20.560
But that's already a shop.

56:20.560 --> 56:21.600
Ikea.

56:21.600 --> 56:22.960
I'm gonna be straight with you.

56:22.960 --> 56:24.720
I'm having trouble focusing on this question

56:24.720 --> 56:26.560
because I was just thinking about Riverdale

56:26.560 --> 56:28.640
and how I did used to watch that show.

56:28.640 --> 56:30.400
But then I quit watching it.

56:30.400 --> 56:33.680
There was an episode during this story arc

56:33.680 --> 56:36.720
where there was a murderer who was murdering people

56:36.720 --> 56:39.360
in the town of Riverdale.

56:40.160 --> 56:43.600
And like killed a couple people.

56:43.600 --> 56:46.640
And Archie got pretty PO'd about that.

56:46.640 --> 56:48.240
I was gonna say Archie got killed

56:48.240 --> 56:50.400
which would have been a really brave move.

56:50.400 --> 56:52.640
No, but what Archie did

56:52.640 --> 56:55.760
cause he didn't like that there are people getting murdered

56:55.760 --> 56:57.360
is he got a bunch of his friends

56:58.080 --> 57:01.040
and they put on red masks

57:01.040 --> 57:03.680
and were shirtless in his garage

57:03.680 --> 57:05.120
and they filmed themselves.

57:05.920 --> 57:07.680
And Archie was basically like,

57:08.880 --> 57:11.280
hey, serial killer.

57:11.280 --> 57:14.480
If you don't stop, we're gonna kill you.

57:14.480 --> 57:18.560
And I was like, I think I might be done watching this.

57:18.560 --> 57:22.000
That's the wildest thing for a person to ever do

57:22.000 --> 57:25.040
that I don't think I can hang

57:25.040 --> 57:26.560
with this show's energy anymore.

57:26.560 --> 57:30.240
Griffin, what is your criteria for watching a show then?

57:30.240 --> 57:32.720
Because that for me is where I am now

57:32.720 --> 57:35.840
for the first time interested in watching Riverdale.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.760
Apparently it's got real magic in it now

57:39.760 --> 57:43.760
and I don't, that's whatever, but I wanna.

57:43.760 --> 57:44.880
Does Jughead do magic?

57:44.880 --> 57:45.680
That's exciting.

57:45.680 --> 57:48.560
I want a teen boys anti-murder club

57:49.120 --> 57:51.360
who goes out and if there's people doing killing

57:51.360 --> 57:54.080
we do killing on them first.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.840
Well, it sounds like at least they gave a warning

57:55.840 --> 57:57.280
and serial killers don't do that.

57:57.280 --> 57:58.080
Dexter never did that.

57:58.080 --> 57:59.520
And we're clearly shirtless

57:59.520 --> 58:02.080
so you can see that our football bodies

58:02.080 --> 58:04.960
could hurt your body killer person.

58:06.160 --> 58:09.040
Unless the killer person, I don't know,

58:09.040 --> 58:10.800
maybe is more in shape

58:10.800 --> 58:13.200
or has more friends than Archie.

58:13.200 --> 58:14.960
But that's not possible.

58:14.960 --> 58:16.320
Archie has a lot of friends.

58:16.320 --> 58:17.120
Very popular.

58:17.760 --> 58:20.560
Jughead alone could take down a murderer too.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.000
You didn't finish watching it

58:24.000 --> 58:25.200
but do you think it turned out

58:25.200 --> 58:26.240
that Jughead was the murderer?

58:26.240 --> 58:27.360
Was the murderer.

58:27.360 --> 58:28.000
Yeah.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Murdering for hamburger money, I assume.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.160
I haven't watched the show but I've read the comics.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.320
The podcast is over.

58:34.960 --> 58:35.460
Okay.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.400
Thanks for listening to My Brother My Brother

58:38.400 --> 58:38.800
made it magic for the modern era.

58:38.800 --> 58:41.040
I didn't know we could just do that.

58:41.040 --> 58:42.320
Yeah, I can do it.

58:42.320 --> 58:43.520
I actually have the power.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.080
Oh, okay.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.920
Next time do it like 15 minutes in.

58:47.040 --> 58:50.000
No, we have to do enough comedy

58:50.000 --> 58:51.680
to keep this nation afloat.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.080
That's a lot of pressure on us.

58:54.080 --> 58:54.720
Yeah.

58:54.720 --> 58:56.080
Don't be afraid.

58:56.080 --> 58:57.200
Embrace the challenge.

58:58.880 --> 58:59.380
Okay.

59:00.640 --> 59:01.360
Do you guys want to say anything?

59:01.360 --> 59:01.860
I do.

59:02.960 --> 59:04.400
In closing, I have a couple things.

59:05.280 --> 59:06.960
First, there's going to be some really great

59:06.960 --> 59:08.080
new merch out this week.

59:08.080 --> 59:10.880
Over at mcrormerch.com, we're bringing back

59:10.880 --> 59:11.680
the pin of the month.

59:12.560 --> 59:15.840
And this month we're doing a tiger on the table

59:15.840 --> 59:18.480
pin of the month designed by Sam Schultz.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.640
And the proceeds for that are going to go to benefit

59:20.640 --> 59:23.600
the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, which defends

59:23.600 --> 59:25.920
and protects the human rights of black transgender

59:25.920 --> 59:27.920
and gender non-conforming people.

59:27.920 --> 59:30.160
And the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, which works

59:30.160 --> 59:32.000
to guarantee that all people are free to determine

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
their gender identity and expression.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.280

You can check that out.

59:46.080 --> 59:46.580
So cute.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.800
We have a book coming out that is all about

And one more thing, we're doing some panels,

some stuff with New York Comic Con all digitally,

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.880
not in person because we are responsible.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.480

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.200
Hey, thanks to John Roderick and the Longwinders

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.320
for the use for our theme song.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.720
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.600
It's very good and the song is good and the album is good.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.800

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.640
Y'all want that final?

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.920
Oh, yeah.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.200
One more thing, just a little thing.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:09.760
Yeah.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.720
Theresa and I are doing a little watch-along kind of podcast

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.080
thing for Great British Bake Off.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.680
We're posting the episodes up on our YouTube channel,

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.200
the McElroy Family YouTube channel.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.200
It's called Bake On.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.160
Is it video?

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.960
Well, it's got a static image with audio on it.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.320
Okay.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.680
Yeah, so you can go and listen on YouTube.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.960
It's really cute and funny.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.200
Um, hey, here comes that, man, I was going to read this final,

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.320
but then like when you're looking at Yahoo Answers,

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.160
there's like stories that appear on top,

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.440
like little news stories.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.000
And I don't know, one of them is even better than any final Yahoo

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.400
I could do because the headline of this story is

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.800
Dennis Quaid is over Cancel Culture.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:58.720
Okay.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.920
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.560
