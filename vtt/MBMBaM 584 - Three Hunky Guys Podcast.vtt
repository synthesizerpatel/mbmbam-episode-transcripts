WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.300 --> 00:50.300
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:10.800 --> 01:15.940
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me and it's an advice show for the margin era

01:15.940 --> 01:21.860
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. Yep. I'm your sweet, baby, brother

01:23.780 --> 01:25.780
Okay

01:27.700 --> 01:33.300
Now that we finally hit the year and we've actually in a year about a dog with no bones

01:33.300 --> 01:39.580
We really fucking nailed it and I dare I go forget. Okay, that's okay, but you can never say it again that era

01:41.060 --> 01:44.900
Yeah, so I was listening to and listen, I don't want to promote

01:44.900 --> 01:51.140
On another podcast because as everyone knows all comp podcasts are competing all the time. That's right. We'll call it

01:51.820 --> 01:56.460
Schmid schmize on yeah, shmed gum with Schmoner

01:56.940 --> 01:58.820
Schmattliff, right?

01:58.820 --> 02:00.820
That is actually inscrutable

02:00.820 --> 02:04.300
Yeah, even if somebody who knows what you're talking about. Yeah, it's the podcast dead eyes

02:04.300 --> 02:11.700
And there was an episode where they talked about like child actors, right who had played younger versions of Tom Hanks

02:11.700 --> 02:18.420
Oh, and it got me thinking that a lot of people talk about like if they made a movie about your life who would play you

02:18.420 --> 02:26.380
And people always think about like younger actors or like actors their same age, but I want to ask you guys because I think

02:27.540 --> 02:32.540
The next move the next big step in like biopic or biopic

02:33.220 --> 02:36.860
Movies used to make movies about people who are still alive

02:36.860 --> 02:42.940
But what we think they're gonna do when they get older, right? So kind of a future

02:42.940 --> 02:44.700
You should know nonfiction. Yes

02:44.700 --> 02:51.140
And so who would you want to play you as an older like if they made a movie about you right now?

02:51.700 --> 02:57.100
Yeah, like 75 looking about all the awesome shit you did in the next like 40 years, right?

02:57.100 --> 03:02.180
Who were irritated by the fact that this has come like it's actually a pretty good idea. Hey, thank you

03:02.180 --> 03:08.260
It's like just but I don't think it I always get like I feel like there's a level of idea

03:08.260 --> 03:13.180
That's like podcast good. You know what I mean? Where it's like we can just kind of dump it out here

03:15.740 --> 03:19.700
Moving car. Yeah, I mean it's gotta be Kirk Cameron Wow

03:20.980 --> 03:28.700
Controversial pit Griffin. I don't know. No, I don't like the guy. Oh, yeah, I find I find love them. I love it

03:28.700 --> 03:34.900
It's so funny. Yeah, you look at it and you're like, yeah, sure Griffin. He was funny and growing pains

03:34.900 --> 03:36.900
It's like no this dude says

03:37.220 --> 03:44.700
Really funny shit all the time. Yeah, he's Andy Kaufman level s committed to this weird character. He's been playing so into it

03:46.380 --> 03:50.940
Even his even his sister Candace Karen's like anyway, you guys know my dumb shit, bro

03:51.900 --> 03:55.060
She's also kind of in on the joke though, huh a little bit

03:55.060 --> 04:00.460
She's a little bit see I was thinking for me and maybe this is just wishful thinking

04:00.580 --> 04:02.940
But I really think he and I share the same energy

04:02.940 --> 04:08.260
I'm just gonna say Brian Cox because I think when you see Brian Cox you think like that's an old Travis McElroy

04:08.260 --> 04:11.220
but like I said, maybe that's wishful thinking and and

04:11.900 --> 04:15.140
It's probably not that is that no, it's probably no

04:15.900 --> 04:21.820
Fishers might be a good Travis. Here's the thing with this Travis is I could say literally anything

04:21.820 --> 04:26.480
I could say literally anyone because who the fuck knows what I'm gonna get up to in 40 years

04:26.860 --> 04:31.760
Well, but at this point Griffin, I mean you're what you're 34 at this point

04:31.980 --> 04:32.500
Yeah

04:32.500 --> 04:39.380
And so I think you have you can look at yourself at like 12 and see the progression of 22 years

04:39.380 --> 04:42.540
So I think you could right now say like I think at 56

04:42.620 --> 04:46.940
We've aged your baby to an adult and this is what we think he'll look like kind of thing

04:46.940 --> 04:52.140
You know what? I mean? Yeah, so I think you can probably extrapolate where you're gonna be. Um

04:53.060 --> 04:56.060
No, I don't think so, but I think her camera is a good start

04:56.860 --> 04:58.860
Okay, bold a bold choice

04:59.740 --> 05:01.580
Justin

05:01.580 --> 05:03.580
hmm a

05:03.860 --> 05:09.300
Justin McElroy type I'm trying to figure out who's got like the heat Justin McElroy

05:10.620 --> 05:12.620
Energy, you know, yeah

05:12.620 --> 05:16.580
Who's like my like it's sort of like I mean

05:18.100 --> 05:21.380
Who's like got a Justin like who's got like a genuine

05:22.140 --> 05:26.940
Like I feel everybody's saying Dev Patel. Yeah, I could Justin McElroy

05:27.580 --> 05:29.580
Energy that the I'm not sure

05:30.060 --> 05:32.060
sexuality handsomeness

05:32.980 --> 05:35.100
Tell sir like

05:36.100 --> 05:38.100
Sort of like a Dev Patel

05:38.100 --> 05:43.180
I mean, there is one problem Justin. I'm not sure he's older than you

05:43.180 --> 05:49.660
I think that's the one issue that I'm having with that passing Travis. He is an actor

05:51.220 --> 05:52.660
So

05:52.660 --> 05:54.660
Now Justin

05:54.940 --> 05:58.100
Like body. Yeah, like more of a

05:58.740 --> 06:01.860
Camille body with like a Dev Patel face. Yeah

06:02.460 --> 06:06.340
Sexuality and chemistry and like a handsomeness and stuff and now Justin I'm just gonna throw this out

06:06.340 --> 06:08.340
This is a bit of a different

06:08.540 --> 06:14.100
Direction than Dev Patel, but you know if we could get Streep that almost guarantees an Oscar

06:14.460 --> 06:17.660
You know what? I mean get that Oscar buzz going if we could get Streep

06:18.460 --> 06:19.940
Yeah

06:19.940 --> 06:25.940
It would be great if what a challenge for her. I know what a yeah, what a departure, you know

06:26.260 --> 06:31.260
Street if you want to do something that's gonna get people talking, you know, yeah

06:31.260 --> 06:39.140
Yeah, because you'll have to really dig deep to find the charisma within her to match your energy, right?

06:39.140 --> 06:40.140
Well, yeah

06:40.140 --> 06:46.700
Dev Patel level energy and sexuality with us do like what was that? Um, what was the

06:47.980 --> 06:52.220
Bob Dylan movie where like they hadn't multiple actors play him we could do

06:53.460 --> 06:59.240
Wonder Emporium exactly the magical boat of dr. Parnassus exactly

06:59.240 --> 07:01.840
Very exact kind of thing because it's just called Dr. Who?

07:02.760 --> 07:05.400
No, I think it's called the sky captain in the world of tomorrow

07:05.840 --> 07:10.600
But I think we could get because I would like to see I here's here's the lineup

07:10.600 --> 07:13.560
I think you go Glenn Close then you go Streep

07:13.760 --> 07:20.320
Then you go Glenn Close and Streep together like true west and how you like trade it off and then you go a Dev Patel

07:20.320 --> 07:22.320
And then you're gonna bring it back

07:22.880 --> 07:27.320
Like who's a hot child star right now, you know, we're gonna have like a way

07:27.320 --> 07:29.040
Yeah, Nicky

07:29.040 --> 07:32.320
Yeah, Nicky in there. Maybe a Timmy TimothÃ©e Chalamet

07:32.320 --> 07:37.640
We get all of them in and they yeah, but here's the thing they're all talking to each other

07:37.640 --> 07:41.120
It's all just it's oops. I'll just it's all Justin's that's cool. That's cool

07:41.120 --> 07:45.800
What would be really cool is if in 40 years the thing Justin's best known for is not these podcasts

07:45.800 --> 07:47.960
but that like I don't know he invents a

07:49.640 --> 07:54.520
Hat that smells good. So when you come out of the bathroom, you don't have a bathroom smell behind you

07:54.520 --> 08:00.840
You were you were like your good-smelling bathroom hat and then you get Glenn Close out there like it's my bathroom hat

08:00.960 --> 08:06.720
Yeah, like is that actually Justin or I'm confused. Is this one of those CGI things?

08:06.720 --> 08:13.800
What what is hard is like the best chance I have of being depicted in the film at this point. Yeah

08:14.320 --> 08:17.840
Is if somebody does a berries and cream movie?

08:19.360 --> 08:22.960
Okay, that's my best shot to get into a movie

08:22.960 --> 08:27.120
I feel like I just a macro character into a movie like

08:28.040 --> 08:33.440
Okay. See for me. I think the best hope of getting a Travis macro biopic is probably some kind of

08:34.240 --> 08:40.080
whimsical but definitely still like fairly serious crime spree where it's just like

08:40.640 --> 08:44.180
Where people are trying to understand like where it all went wrong kind of thing

08:44.180 --> 08:51.480
But also I have a certain charisma much like you know that movie where it would they were Robin Banks

08:51.480 --> 08:56.800
But everybody seemed to like him a lot, you know that one. Oh sure sure. Yeah with that jazz

08:57.560 --> 09:00.760
Bruno yeah. Yeah, I would I

09:01.560 --> 09:08.840
Feel like there's also a decent chance. I might be very briefly depicted in if they did rocket boys again

09:08.840 --> 09:13.360
yeah, the West Virginia guys that did Rockets if they didn't run boys again and

09:13.720 --> 09:20.200
At the end they wanted to be like and there's still people in West Virginia today. It was just like me going. Oh, yeah

09:20.200 --> 09:22.140
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm here, too

09:22.140 --> 09:25.680
there's actually a very good chance, you know in that there will be a

09:26.320 --> 09:30.780
biopic of like Lynn that we might be depicted in and if that happens and

09:31.080 --> 09:36.180
Lynn you're like you have any voice in it, please make sure it's just three really ripped dudes

09:37.600 --> 09:39.360
fully jacked

09:39.360 --> 09:43.760
Like six foot eight like hunks, you know what I mean?

09:44.280 --> 09:46.280
Right because you want it to be accurate

09:46.280 --> 09:52.560
Hunky hunky guys, we're three hunky guys and we do a podcast together. What kind of podcast you ask?

09:52.560 --> 09:58.000
Well, it's weird that you just started listening sight unseen, but like hey good. Appreciate it

09:58.000 --> 10:02.140
Maybe it was just on maybe somebody's sitting in the tired disc counters like waiting room right now

10:02.880 --> 10:04.880
It's playing

10:06.560 --> 10:14.360
From the view to our podcast. Yeah, it's streaming to their television or something. Well device. It's an advice shit

10:14.360 --> 10:16.960
Why isn't there a podcast channel? Come on

10:18.960 --> 10:20.960
Come on

10:21.640 --> 10:27.320
There's lots of channels, you know, yeah, right almost too many sometimes it's scrolling through there and I'm like, what's what's all this?

10:27.560 --> 10:31.360
There's like eight a trio's, you know the chills. I like on TV

10:31.360 --> 10:34.840
I don't have them anywhere. I don't think or at least I is a music choice

10:34.840 --> 10:38.240
Oh, I like that. There's it where your TV's like I could play music

10:38.240 --> 10:44.440
It's like I know yeah, can you can you play whatever song I want? Oh, no, I can come match up

10:44.440 --> 10:48.880
I don't want to feel like some Weather Channel jazz. Yeah. Yeah, actually I do

10:49.000 --> 10:52.680
But without all the trouble of the weather being there also. Yeah

10:53.280 --> 10:54.400
I

10:54.400 --> 10:56.800
Work for the u.s. Snowboard team. Hell, yeah

10:57.520 --> 11:03.500
My role in short is to use wax to make the boards go fast like in Christmas vacation

11:03.500 --> 11:08.380
Oh for sure. So you know the main way. Yes is a non-nutrient varnish. Yeah

11:08.900 --> 11:12.480
My job is inherently nerdy and I'm sounds cool to me

11:14.600 --> 11:22.080
If that's if that's nerdy then I'm I'm a hundred I'm a thousand percent that minkus. Yeah, I just got a

11:24.880 --> 11:30.640
My job is inherently nerdy and I am spending time with a lot of rad athletes who do rad stunts

11:30.640 --> 11:36.520
I don't like dangerous stunts. How do we come rad? That's from Paul and st. Paul. Well, that's a good hook

11:36.520 --> 11:44.840
Yeah, yeah, right there. I think when I first read this question what hit me Paul if I may I think that you have one a

11:45.280 --> 11:51.120
Fundamental misunderstanding of what is rad. Yeah, but your view has been skewed

11:51.120 --> 11:55.000
Yes, but you got too close like Icarus, you know

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
I mean like you got too close to to true coolness and you've kind of lost perspective a little bit, right?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.960
Yeah, right, right, right, right, right, right

12:02.960 --> 12:10.280
Like this is like I bet that there are top level like high school varsity baseball players that like look at

12:10.280 --> 12:13.040
You know people in the MLB and they're like, I'll never be that

12:13.320 --> 12:19.960
Well here I am looking at you varsity player thinking I'll never be that so don't you worry about it?

12:19.960 --> 12:27.040
But I I also think Paul well, you have to understand is these snowboarders. This is their day-to-day, right?

12:27.040 --> 12:31.320
They're they're so used to doing dangerous stunts and seeing other people do dangerous stunts

12:31.320 --> 12:33.480
I don't think that counts as rad to them anymore

12:33.720 --> 12:40.380
But when you start talking about this cool board wax that you use and how the science works on it

12:40.600 --> 12:45.960
that's what's gonna blow them away they then that's what's going to be impressive to them or

12:45.960 --> 12:51.840
You're gonna have to get good at rad stunts. It's one of those two. I don't you don't want to do that

12:51.840 --> 12:55.800
Um, that's not rad to them. What you know, I mean, you know

12:56.080 --> 13:01.280
If I could suggest one quick thing, you should start going by st. Paul. That's pretty good. That's cool, right?

13:01.280 --> 13:05.040
It is your name's Paul just start getting people to call you st

13:05.040 --> 13:10.100
But now that I'm cool that might be misleading though Justin for people who first meet st. Paul

13:10.440 --> 13:14.720
But it might be like it's like a shit. It's sticky. I want to know everything about this

13:14.720 --> 13:18.840
Yeah, yeah for sure. Who is it? Yeah, but what if they're really a saint?

13:18.840 --> 13:21.200
What if they get sainted later because of like?

13:22.440 --> 13:29.560
This is easy. This is easy st. St. Paul. Um, I think in high school, you know who was cool

13:30.280 --> 13:34.700
Not not me, but follow me. Okay, all that all the athletes

13:35.840 --> 13:37.840
Who is second coolest?

13:37.840 --> 13:43.680
You know kids not the equipment fuck. No, not the equipment manager. I kind of said it with my fingers crossed

13:43.680 --> 13:45.040
I was really hoping

13:45.040 --> 13:51.760
But it was the kid at the lunch table who would eat anything you can put in this cup for $1

13:54.520 --> 14:01.500
Right, and so it's just sometimes while you're waxing their boards and they're like definitely micromanaging like did you wax the middle?

14:02.000 --> 14:06.080
You just scoop some of that wax up and you just take a big bite out of it

14:06.080 --> 14:11.680
No, like hold what the holy shit. Did you just eat some of that wax and it's like yeah, I did

14:11.920 --> 14:17.180
Why do you think I'm so good at this me and the wax or one and they're like, whoa, have you talked to st. Paul?

14:17.760 --> 14:20.080
He eats board wax. You gotta see that

14:24.480 --> 14:29.040
When you said the sentence have you talked to st. Paul he eats board wax

14:29.120 --> 14:35.240
Did you realize that you had absolutely deep six this human being like you have absolutely lowered their stock

14:35.240 --> 14:41.200
I don't think no, no, no, cuz then there that kid eats that kid eats paste that kid eats board wax. They are too

14:41.840 --> 14:49.240
Awesome, and they started calling themselves st. Paul, right? That's actually that me. Is that because of all the board wax they've been eating?

14:51.200 --> 14:53.040
Yeah a little bit

14:53.040 --> 14:58.000
By the way, I never saw anybody eat paste my entire, you know school career

14:58.680 --> 15:03.120
But if I did I would want to know more about that person because that's a yes

15:03.120 --> 15:09.440
Griffin, but not I think once again, you are only thinking about the interest but not

15:10.240 --> 15:11.680
perhaps the

15:11.680 --> 15:18.240
Kind of interest you would be a really quick like hey, I'm this you're eating pace. Yeah, I'm kind of pervert

15:20.280 --> 15:27.440
Yeah, I don't think that you would have a moment of like I'm interested in this kid on a really deep spiritual level

15:27.440 --> 15:30.800
It doesn't have to be interested in a spiritual. We're just trying to be cool and come

15:30.800 --> 15:37.960
Yeah, mysterious, but not eating. I feel like eating things. You're not supposed to eat is not it's really like cool

15:38.240 --> 15:42.520
It's not cool. Unless you like unless one thing that I try to jump

15:42.520 --> 15:45.760
You can't write hop skip and jump over and unless like that unless

15:46.640 --> 15:51.760
Unless when I was in middle school in high school more high school

15:51.760 --> 15:57.400
I think for like a year or so. I tried to be cool by having a habit of

15:57.400 --> 16:02.200
Keeping a thumbtack in my mouth. Remember this, huh? Yeah

16:03.320 --> 16:08.200
I do I did. I would like have a thumbtack in my mouth like the pointy side out, right?

16:08.200 --> 16:12.960
I would have like chew on the plastic in and that's that's bonkers juicer

16:13.600 --> 16:18.600
Yeah, I wish I hadn't said it now at least it's just between us three

16:20.320 --> 16:26.320
Yeah, it's just like it was a I don't mind to be open about the ways in which I tried and failed

16:26.320 --> 16:32.120
To look cool, to be cool, look cool, be cool, seem cool, sound cool, act cool

16:32.880 --> 16:38.320
My any of it really yeah, cuz it worked out, you know, yeah inspirationally sure

16:40.160 --> 16:43.040
I really really killed the mode there

16:44.000 --> 16:51.080
revelation, I'm sorry. It's weird now as an adult to retroactively be really worried about my teenage or older brother

16:51.520 --> 16:54.560
Like that. I wish I could go back in time and just say like hey, bud

16:54.560 --> 17:01.720
You're cool enough. I'm trying to own myself as a holistic person. You know, I mean, I don't need to be that's not a different me

17:01.720 --> 17:04.400
That's the same me that got us all here. Oh, that's weird

17:05.120 --> 17:08.920
They let drive my kids around. Yeah in a vehicle, you know

17:09.880 --> 17:15.080
It is fun. I think that you should be able to like when you're like, I don't know filling out your taxes or whatever

17:15.080 --> 17:19.360
There should be a spot where it's just like you list all the actual dumb decisions you made

17:19.360 --> 17:24.480
And so then when you're like late on taxes, they're like, I'm just glad we got it at all

17:24.720 --> 17:28.880
Yeah, see what this guy did when he was like 14 and oh my god

17:29.160 --> 17:35.200
He ate a bunch of boardwax then yelled that his tummy was now a snowboard and then he'll then he'll hop on get ready to

17:35.200 --> 17:40.800
Flip and I was like, I don't I don't think flipping is like the main thing in snowboarding

17:41.240 --> 17:47.480
But at that point he was already grinding on every surface in the office. So and he was slippery. He was that

17:47.480 --> 17:52.320
Can I do can I go approach the wizard humbly and

17:53.560 --> 17:59.680
Prostate myself in front of him. Yes, but I really think you need to look that up before we record again

17:59.680 --> 18:01.680
Yeah, I don't think that that's exactly right

18:02.600 --> 18:09.280
Unless you want the wizard to stick a finger in your butt. No, no, no, no. No, I don't I mean no

18:09.280 --> 18:11.280
No, no, I don't want that

18:11.280 --> 18:18.500
So here's this one sent in by Teo. Thank you. It's how to look gothic without your parents getting upset

18:19.800 --> 18:21.800
Please we all

18:22.280 --> 18:27.400
You know have gone through and or are still going through this stage of our lives

18:27.560 --> 18:31.760
Yeah, and we all struggled with it because we were like, you know, we watched

18:32.600 --> 18:34.600
Edward Scissorhands

18:35.400 --> 18:37.400
yeah, the craft or

18:37.400 --> 18:40.240
The craft just like the Addams family

18:41.120 --> 18:47.720
Addams family saw that we're like, I would love to just sort of just chomp Raul Julia's

18:48.600 --> 18:54.640
Style right now and be that yeah, but then we did it. We were just like overnight wham-bam. Thank you

18:54.640 --> 19:00.120
Thank you ma'am and came downstairs and we you know, we're perfectly cosplaying as

19:00.640 --> 19:04.840
As Gomez Addams and our parents were like no, that's too much

19:04.840 --> 19:11.440
No, that's too much. But here is how to really do it without upsetting your parents because that's the most important thing

19:12.320 --> 19:19.720
Part one nothing goth about upsetting your bear exactly to part one dressing goth transform yourself at a slow pace

19:22.560 --> 19:25.600
Plan to look goth over an extended period

19:25.600 --> 19:34.200
Incorporate clothes that identify you as goth one piece at a time and over many months create a six-month plan. Um

19:34.720 --> 19:42.240
Cuz it's like the easiest way to boil a frog or by which I mean your parents you just they'd look at you one day

19:42.240 --> 19:44.240
Why are you boiling your parents?

19:44.400 --> 19:49.260
You're eight months in your parents like wait up. Wait a tick. Hold up. Hold up a second

19:49.720 --> 19:54.520
You got a different sort of different flavor today. Hey, every Debbie

19:54.520 --> 19:56.720
Is Griffin always look like this?

19:57.640 --> 20:02.760
Yeah, I'm looking at him and I'm thinking is that new but then when I'm like

20:03.560 --> 20:09.360
Remembering Griffin for the last six to eight months. I can't remember a time where he didn't

20:09.880 --> 20:13.840
Kind of look like this. Are we okay with this? Are we okay?

20:15.120 --> 20:16.720
Yeah

20:16.720 --> 20:18.720
Incorporate some bright colors into your fashion

20:18.720 --> 20:24.720
Well, well by incorporating some bright colors, you'll send the signal that although you are goth. You are not going overboard

20:25.760 --> 20:30.720
You can still easing in. Yes, don't rush it. No, it's savor it. Enjoy it

20:30.920 --> 20:35.060
This is these are your final days as a normie and so you can you know?

20:35.560 --> 20:39.840
Enjoy that until you are ready to fucking, you know party party with the vampires

20:40.640 --> 20:44.200
You also need to be able to back off of it if it's not like

20:44.920 --> 20:46.560
landing for yeah

20:46.560 --> 20:49.100
Like you need to be like I don't think I was

20:49.760 --> 20:52.720
God, that doesn't sound right. No, don't you remember yesterday?

20:53.280 --> 20:59.160
Like you came into school and you were like fully kitted out with like you remember it's like no

21:00.120 --> 21:05.520
I don't are you okay? Here's a good flip dress somewhat conservatively

21:05.960 --> 21:11.300
While the color scheme of your goth style might frighten your parents you can temper this by embracing a somewhat conservative approach

21:12.240 --> 21:14.240
the picture I am seeing here is

21:14.240 --> 21:18.920
two people and there's a dude who is wearing like a

21:20.400 --> 21:27.400
Very sleek blazer over a black button-up shirt with a black belt with some black pants and his hair is done

21:27.400 --> 21:31.060
All good, and there's a lady with the same sort of fashion going on

21:31.060 --> 21:36.200
And I just am imagining one of us as a teenager walking downstairs in our

21:37.280 --> 21:42.600
In our you know vampire going to a wedding outfit and just be like hello. Hello mother and father

21:42.600 --> 21:45.920
Don't worry about me. I'm goth now

21:46.480 --> 21:48.480
Well time to go to work

21:48.480 --> 21:51.320
Yeah, gotta go. I got a shift at TCBY today

21:51.320 --> 21:56.280
I think if your kids got you got a cancel work that day and just talk through it you got to understand it

21:56.280 --> 22:02.040
Where's it from if nothing else just be like okay because when you go into the world with other teenagers

22:02.040 --> 22:08.200
They might be kind of shitty to you because that's how it works, and I'm listen. I support this 100%

22:08.200 --> 22:14.440
I just want you to know that there will be assholes out there who will not and we're gonna talk through this

22:14.440 --> 22:19.840
I'm getting this right and to be clear. It's not because you're dressing goth. It's because you're wearing a

22:20.440 --> 22:26.720
full suit a full men's magazine cover suit to your

22:27.240 --> 22:34.320
8th-grade class you yes, you're swung hard into what I believe is called executive goth. Yes, exactly

22:34.320 --> 22:39.280
and perhaps you want to start as a more casual goth and then only do

22:39.560 --> 22:46.320
Executive goth on I don't know like standardized testing days like weekend goth is is pretty impactful

22:46.320 --> 22:51.200
What have you found what if you saw one of your teachers at TCBY yeah, and they're a weekend goth

22:51.200 --> 22:56.360
And they're like you too. That's good, or you can do I think it's called like fitness goth

22:58.440 --> 23:02.960
Yeah, and you're like wearing like black tracksuits and stuff, and it's still very gothic

23:02.960 --> 23:08.720
But you're also ready to get out there and work up a sweat. You could also do old old fisherman goth

23:08.720 --> 23:13.100
Oh, that's where one where you you know you sort of fuse those two things together

23:14.000 --> 23:18.560
And that one will confuse people a little bit, so be like who's that old old fisherman you like no

23:18.560 --> 23:20.440
It's it's it's me. I love me

23:20.440 --> 23:26.060
Who's that old fisherman who looks so sad looks so sad, but also so fucking cool. Yeah

23:26.560 --> 23:31.840
There's a bunch of boring shit after that. Let's get into accessorizing focus on goth. That's where it is right

23:31.840 --> 23:34.840
Yeah, if I saw someone in a black t-shirt and black jeans

23:34.840 --> 23:38.880
I'm like okay, but then what's that a spiky wristband? Oh, okay?

23:39.320 --> 23:41.360
Yeah, it could be

23:42.320 --> 23:49.280
JK Simmons if it's just that like a tight tight black t-shirt tight pants like you don't know it might be goth is that's a

23:49.280 --> 23:53.440
Fun game we could make that a game on this show is it goth or is it JK Simmons?

23:53.480 --> 23:56.520
Yeah, we don't actually know if he is part of that lifestyle

23:57.680 --> 23:59.780
Anyway is actually yeah, I do too

23:59.780 --> 24:04.520
I want that for accessories can help you transform your existing wardrobe into one with a gothic flair

24:04.580 --> 24:08.460
Yeah, I had a big bowling shirts face in high school

24:10.460 --> 24:15.180
Tossed on I want to call this episode my brother brother me revelations

24:15.180 --> 24:22.660
Yeah, I wonder if my brother my brother me a retrospective if I had maintained that look and also worn dark scarves

24:22.900 --> 24:28.340
Jewelry like snake bone hair pins a spider ring a bat bracelet, then it just says belts yeah

24:28.340 --> 24:32.540
Well, we all know yeah, that's practical, but here's the trick sometimes

24:33.380 --> 24:38.300
You skip the belt loops. It's just about just the belt is there as its own like tiny

24:39.180 --> 24:43.500
That's cool. That's and that's so fucking goth that is so fucking off

24:43.500 --> 24:46.980
This is if we've learned anything from the fact that fitness goth exists

24:47.220 --> 24:54.060
Yeah off is kind of like I think the fashion equivalent of like steampunk is to storytelling

24:54.060 --> 25:00.460
Where it meshes well with pretty much anything so like I could take say my phase in high school

25:00.700 --> 25:04.060
where I wore button-up shirts dress shirts and

25:05.020 --> 25:11.740
tear away exercise pants and dance shoes and add some goth accessories to that and now

25:12.260 --> 25:13.460
I'm

25:13.460 --> 25:18.940
Embarrassing goth you know what I mean just ties all the theater kid goth if you will but Travis by the yeah

25:19.140 --> 25:22.420
I'm sorry for how much I bullied you in high school

25:22.420 --> 25:25.540
I know I actually think you didn't boy me enough because like yeah

25:25.540 --> 25:32.540
I did that for a long enough period that some some older girls had an intervention for me

25:33.260 --> 25:38.700
Like hey, you seem cool. You gotta stop with you got it this look your pants

25:38.740 --> 25:43.100
You're you are in public your pants should not tear away. Yes

25:44.260 --> 25:50.300
Before there were you know like flash mobs yeah, maybe I was just ahead of the curve. You don't know

25:50.300 --> 25:52.300
um yeah, I'm

25:52.780 --> 25:56.620
You can be like mean just kind of like stop evolving your style at 16

25:56.660 --> 25:58.660
Just like get to 16 be like yeah, it's good

25:59.940 --> 26:01.900
Justin's in a short-sleeve button-down. I got it

26:01.900 --> 26:06.820
I'm gonna push back a little bit because you did I would say inject some Disney dad flair in there

26:07.100 --> 26:12.340
Yeah, later in life that was just a circumstance of where I happen to be when I needed a shirt. That's like that's

26:13.340 --> 26:19.580
Good point I would argue in high school juice you had yet to receive the Jimmy Buffett blood transfusion that

26:19.580 --> 26:21.020
transformed you

26:21.020 --> 26:23.020
Into the man you are that was

26:23.100 --> 26:28.460
Don't need fucking island vibes. You're on island time 24 hours a day, and you don't even realize yeah

26:28.460 --> 26:30.980
You need a cold eye of life of age

26:30.980 --> 26:34.860
You may be listening to this right now, and you might be in your house y'all days

26:34.940 --> 26:40.220
So you don't need he Jimmy says take the weather with you as the name one of his albums and the right

26:40.220 --> 26:43.620
That's you do that when you're young. You don't think about it with it when you're older

26:43.620 --> 26:47.780
You got to work at a little bit still attainable um avoid dying your hair black right away

26:47.780 --> 26:53.980
Oh, so fucking yeah, okay make that one. Yeah, no, it's too late

26:53.980 --> 26:58.660
I already I already did yeah, I already did that I assumed make that one yeah

26:59.540 --> 27:03.340
Cuz that's that one's gonna. That's one's good. Might I recommend purple?

27:03.980 --> 27:09.380
Yeah, much better. You'll still ruin a lot of pillowcases and white t-shirt

27:10.060 --> 27:11.900
Yeah

27:11.900 --> 27:17.900
Are you oh man Trav? Are you off? I'm no no no no no no no like I think about it

27:17.900 --> 27:21.140
I understand the impulse, and there's like zero judgment here obviously

27:21.740 --> 27:26.460
Some tact I'm a lot more emo than that. I'm like a like a dad

27:26.460 --> 27:31.580
You know like emo dad like a scene stir dad is what yeah, that's a lot more of my thing. Yeah, yeah

27:31.580 --> 27:35.460
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like the music I'm listening to is like Panic at the Disco and

27:35.980 --> 27:39.620
And fallout boy where it's much more like elder emo Wow

27:39.620 --> 27:43.980
Yeah, you're not kidding. That really is sort of your set. Yeah, yeah guys

27:44.540 --> 27:52.460
Hey, we've known each other for a long time, right? I've never really thought of myself as someone who's living like life with an emo brother

27:53.100 --> 27:59.580
so when I have purple hair and I like eyeliner and like I'm wearing you know like a

28:00.140 --> 28:04.240
Suit with like a little like bird skull lapel pin

28:04.260 --> 28:09.420
Yeah, I bet Travis is it seemed like more like a costume than an expression of your off

28:09.420 --> 28:11.900
Now baby this but now I feel like you're living out

28:11.940 --> 28:17.140
Yeah, man my pride you know my problem, and I feel like this is something we could all learn from

28:17.780 --> 28:24.740
My problem is that I think of you too frequently as a person first hmm and labels second

28:24.740 --> 28:29.740
Oh, I feel like we could all do do well to try to think of people in terms of labels

28:29.780 --> 28:32.940
Yeah, yeah as a person second

28:32.940 --> 28:36.460
I'm working really hard to show my label and people are like yeah

28:36.460 --> 28:39.620
But I don't want to talk about that and it's like but that's all I want to talk about

28:40.820 --> 28:44.500
Please I'm gonna hop forward don't get any tattoos or piercings yeah

28:45.260 --> 28:49.660
And then we're gonna move on to part three because I'm assuming by the way that they will tell me when it is okay to dye

28:49.660 --> 28:55.220
My hair yeah, I'm just circle back on it if you're gonna delay me on it and eventually I can get tattoos and piercings, right?

28:55.900 --> 28:59.700
Someday yeah, I think could you do a an ombra?

28:59.700 --> 29:03.660
I think is what it's called where you just get a little bit of the hair dyed black

29:03.660 --> 29:09.980
Mmm, and then your parents will be like is he going is this hair going wait. It's not going gray. What's going on?

29:11.140 --> 29:17.940
So part three behaving well wait be true to yourself. You don't have to change your which one is it yes

29:19.620 --> 29:21.080
Be true to your best self

29:21.080 --> 29:26.940
I guess step two and this is an awesome one for like any one of these like lifestyle things and it's

29:27.460 --> 29:29.460
Number two get good grades

29:29.540 --> 29:30.900
Yeah

29:30.900 --> 29:34.500
They should put that in kind of saying they should put that in literally everything

29:35.820 --> 29:40.900
It's like how to live like Goku, and it's like it's just a practice meditation and get very strong

29:40.900 --> 29:43.180
And then it's gonna be like and then get good grades

29:43.780 --> 29:47.100
Because that's awesome. You're gonna learn stuff and have better opportunities

29:47.820 --> 29:52.840
And your parents will be very pleased with you even though you're living that full-blown Goku lifestyle

29:52.840 --> 30:00.320
Oh, man avoid friends who get into trouble. Yeah, you don't know what is going on on this list

30:00.320 --> 30:02.960
I feel like somebody's grandma what wrote this yeah, right?

30:02.960 --> 30:07.920
I will remind you listen sitting backwards on a no no Griffin. Yes, please your mind is curving

30:07.920 --> 30:13.120
The article is how to look gothic without your parents getting upset and so this one's like if you did dye your hair black

30:13.120 --> 30:17.280
And you got six lip piercings, and then you found this article

30:17.280 --> 30:22.320
You'd be like fuck fuck fuck fuck, but then you get to part three, and it's like hey, it's okay

30:22.320 --> 30:24.320
just get good grades and

30:24.880 --> 30:30.360
That's really gonna knock this out of the park don't have friends who get into trouble and it shows somebody guys

30:30.360 --> 30:35.600
And they're smoking a cigarette no no no. Thank you. Yeah, stay away from an age

30:35.920 --> 30:38.840
What are they gonna do when they get on a long airplane flight? Oh?

30:38.840 --> 30:44.200
Yeah, exactly final one show respect to your parents the way you look might alienate your parents

30:44.200 --> 30:47.400
But the way you act and talk to them is more important

30:47.400 --> 30:53.520
But here's the Kobayashi Maru if you're like mom dad. I know I have a different steez now

30:53.520 --> 30:57.880
But I love you both, and I respect you and they say we love you, too

30:58.120 --> 31:03.800
Please go back to the change to dress it the way you used to you can't be like I respect you

31:04.760 --> 31:10.520
But but fuck no I look so cool now. You don't even get it. I'm down. I'm pulling down tail

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
24-7

31:14.280 --> 31:15.680
Understand

31:15.680 --> 31:19.200
Parents just don't understand how much tail I'm pulling with my new gothic style

31:19.360 --> 31:23.680
Because it can't be like the last step in this is like go back to normal if your parents

31:24.360 --> 31:25.580
Wicked don't like it

31:25.580 --> 31:30.920
you know what I mean like you could have good grades and get rid of your smoking friends and be true to yourself and

31:31.040 --> 31:32.480
all that and

31:32.480 --> 31:40.120
They could still even after all that work be like go change go change you know here's what it is Griffin Griffin Griffin Griffin Griffin

31:40.120 --> 31:47.520
First before you do any of the style changes you start to get bad grades and hang out with kids who smell

31:47.520 --> 31:52.920
Oh my god, Travis. Yes, and then as you transition to the goth style

31:53.320 --> 31:59.880
Yeah, start to clean up your act, and they're like I don't know what it is, but is it's really working for them

31:59.880 --> 32:03.200
You know and they see it like they're connected. I

32:04.360 --> 32:06.920
Like that a lot. I like that a lot

32:06.920 --> 32:08.920
I like that a lot

32:09.560 --> 32:15.560
It's like when Justin got blonde highlights, and yeah, and then he started I didn't even volunteer that I

32:16.200 --> 32:19.360
Thought it would be okay because we're all just sort of dish and dishing out this

32:21.040 --> 32:26.040
More like a self dish so far hasn't it felt like that so far that it's more of a

32:26.520 --> 32:33.360
Self dish like a self-serve eat. You know eat what you want kind of deal. No yeah, I think Griffin's right

32:34.280 --> 32:36.280
Justin anything you want to say about Griffin

32:36.280 --> 32:40.420
Yeah, no, I love my brother very much. You'd blast me. No

32:40.420 --> 32:43.080
I don't you don't want to talk about when he bought the

32:43.280 --> 32:46.960
Red goggles from Hot Topic and his friend Evan bought the green goggles

32:46.960 --> 32:50.840
And then they switched one lens of both so they had red and green goggles

32:50.840 --> 32:54.320
Yeah, that's just he was going to see a 3d movie later that you want no

32:54.320 --> 32:59.040
I definitely wore them at school, but and that and that theater practice

32:59.400 --> 33:04.800
But are you are you they're called rehearsal Travis, but how are you gonna blast the coolest thing I've ever done in my life

33:04.800 --> 33:09.200
That's fair. Yeah, yeah, you know it's true. I

33:09.920 --> 33:12.520
Don't really want to blast you. I love my brother, okay?

33:13.520 --> 33:16.400
You did try to get people to call you Andy that one. Yeah, that's true

33:16.800 --> 33:19.600
Well, I also tried to get the nickname shades going at church camp

33:19.600 --> 33:24.360
This is all stuff that we've talked about on this show. We've been doing it for a billion billion trillion trillion trillion years

33:24.360 --> 33:38.280
Yeah, let's take a break and make some money right yeah, and then we'll come back and do some other things

33:38.280 --> 33:42.960
You guys know what I just built a website on Squarespace yesterday

33:43.400 --> 33:45.960
Did you? I did. What is it?

33:46.080 --> 33:50.300
I'm working on a new podcast that I'm executive producing called chasing immortality

33:50.300 --> 33:57.640
And I wanted to build a website for that and I made what's the website address chasing immortality pod calm, okay?

33:58.200 --> 34:02.020
And I think it's a I mean it's listen. It's it's nothing

34:03.040 --> 34:08.040
I'm really worried about I'm Charlie. I'm really worried about you. Did you just call Charlie Travis?

34:08.040 --> 34:12.400
I'm really worried about you now. I can find two words. I'm really worried about you Travis

34:13.200 --> 34:17.160
Website looks so expensive. Oh, and that you must have spent so much money

34:17.160 --> 34:25.280
Getting professional to design this website. Oh, no Justin Justin Justin Justin. You dumb piece of shit. I

34:25.960 --> 34:30.160
Made it myself in about like 30 to 40 minutes

34:30.840 --> 34:34.680
You're kidding me. No you stupid asshole. I made that

34:37.320 --> 34:44.240
Oh, you're right you're right hey friends in case you I should I should clarify for the bit Squarespace is great

34:44.240 --> 34:47.480
Travis actually did not work very hard on this website

34:48.280 --> 34:53.680
Take another pass at it. Yes, I did. I mean I'm gonna take another pass at it, but I needed something functional

34:55.240 --> 34:58.300
Started and the thing the bigger point Justin

34:58.300 --> 35:03.440
But I was trying to get to is I realized as I was making this was like how many websites

35:03.440 --> 35:10.200
I have used at Squarespace to build for just kind of off-the-cuff like ideas. I've had a cup indeed and

35:10.760 --> 35:12.280

Treaty right on there. Hey kid

38:00.660 --> 38:05.280
Your dad tell you about the time. He broke Stephen Dorf's knows that the kids Choice Awards

38:06.180 --> 38:10.500
In dead pilot society scripts that were developed by studios and networks

38:10.500 --> 38:14.060
But were never produced are given the table reads they deserve

38:14.340 --> 38:20.540
When I was a kid, I had to spend my Christmas break filming a PSA about angel dust. So yeah being a kid sucks sometimes

38:20.540 --> 38:28.180
Presented by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker dead pilot society twice a month on maximumfun.org

38:29.420 --> 38:32.460
You know the show you like that hobo with the scarf who lives in a magic dumpster

38:36.380 --> 38:38.380
Doctor who

38:43.860 --> 38:45.860
I have lots of fish tanks

38:45.860 --> 38:52.140
What one of which is on my bathroom vanity the problem is that my bathroom is where I get dressed every morning?

38:52.700 --> 38:58.560
Because closing the blinds in my room takes effort, and I am lazy Travis you can certainly relate to this. I sure do

38:59.340 --> 39:02.460
Consequently my fish sees me naked a lot is this

39:04.180 --> 39:05.580
Inappropriate

39:05.580 --> 39:06.900
Huh?

39:06.900 --> 39:08.700
Hmm. That's some fishy business

39:08.700 --> 39:13.900
There is no way that a fish of any level of intelligence

39:13.900 --> 39:19.180
Could look upon the human form and parse it whatsoever, right?

39:19.700 --> 39:26.340
Not only are we like comparatively gigantic to them. Yeah, so many of the parts are different

39:26.820 --> 39:33.980
Yeah, you couldn't contextualize it. I don't even know if a fish has a has a beamis so what to I

39:34.780 --> 39:40.540
Mean listen, they got eyes and mouth and as far as I could tell the well, I just meant externally

39:40.540 --> 39:44.780
Parts that they can like look at us and be like I know those are eyes

39:45.260 --> 39:50.800
But what the fuck are those would be the rest of it? That's like elbows fingers shoulders

39:50.800 --> 39:56.460
I'm not even getting into any of the like you know the stuff that are covered by clothes like I mean

39:56.460 --> 40:00.860
I can't I mean we could just start here. Okay, fish snake fish naked fish is absolutely naked

40:00.860 --> 40:06.700
Fish is naked fish has always been naked fishes naked fish doesn't even understand anything else other than naked

40:06.700 --> 40:11.500
Yeah, wait, but the first time your fish sees you naked your fish is like, okay, I get this

40:11.500 --> 40:14.780
Yeah, I tell you guys something this I can get into it just fucked me up

40:15.340 --> 40:19.420
What don't Google this but think right now our scales

40:20.140 --> 40:26.100
Fish's skin or are the scales covering their skin underneath are the scales?

40:26.100 --> 40:33.180
Yeah, or the scales like hair the scales are scales cuz it's fish. Yeah, but I mean like what's the what's the corollary, right?

40:33.180 --> 40:38.820
I don't know. It's not you don't mean to meta. You don't need to turn it into a metaphor. It's just scales, bud

40:38.820 --> 40:40.940
But are the scales the same different?

40:45.020 --> 40:48.260
But are the rocks their taxes think about it, yeah

40:51.220 --> 40:57.660
Listen you're being flippant cuz you don't know the answer and that's they're being flippant their fish. That's true. That's yeah, they're being a lipid

40:59.220 --> 41:00.740
I

41:00.740 --> 41:05.380
Just threw a die across the I was thinking I was think you were talking about how fish is naked

41:05.820 --> 41:09.380
When Don Knotts turns into the incredible, mr. Limpet

41:09.380 --> 41:15.100
First of all, he turns into a fish a real shark tail ass looking fish that looks a lot like Don Knotts

41:15.140 --> 41:21.460
But he also has glasses on so he's not completely nude if you think about it. Do you guys ever think that we talk about?

41:22.500 --> 41:27.860
Mr. Limpet so much that maybe we have thought it into existence and it is not

41:27.860 --> 41:30.580
Really actually? Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting

41:30.740 --> 41:31.260
Yeah

41:31.260 --> 41:36.140
Probably because when you think about it is a movie about a man who wishes to be a fish so hard that he turns into

41:36.140 --> 41:39.740
A fish and then helps the US government spot

41:40.420 --> 41:46.380
Like seat like mines in the sea. Yeah to protect submarines in the war

41:46.900 --> 41:48.900
Yeah, man, what a badass

41:49.140 --> 41:53.620
What a complete badass and then I think this man turned fish

41:53.620 --> 42:01.620
Has relations with another fish? Yeah, definitely. It definitely does that what a movie you guys and this is for kids

42:02.100 --> 42:06.440
Yeah, yeah. Well, it's the got it something for grown-ups, too. Yeah

42:07.140 --> 42:13.340
Travis you just got a fish tank. How do you feel about showing your near? I did it day one to establish dominance. Okay

42:14.220 --> 42:20.760
They were probably pretty wild now in there just like what's this new place? Oh, look, there's rocks this water tastes different

42:20.760 --> 42:26.840
Look at that big ass. Is that dude evil or what? What's his vibe?

42:27.960 --> 42:29.960
Whoa a butthole

42:31.640 --> 42:33.640
Why is he showing me this

42:33.800 --> 42:37.640
Fish got my holes fish. Are you freaked out by bowels? Yeah

42:37.640 --> 42:38.440
Yeah

42:38.440 --> 42:45.560
when I bought the fish or my fishing the person at the pet store said like that you had to put him you know in an

42:45.560 --> 42:50.440
Opaque bag to drive them home or else it could like scare the fish too much because

42:50.440 --> 42:56.800
It's the equivalent and there's a quote the equivalent of an alien abduction to them. Yeah, definitely

42:56.800 --> 43:03.840
Have you seen Nemo? And then I started thinking about how much farther that concept extends

43:04.480 --> 43:09.200
We're like if someone picked up me and put me in another house

43:09.920 --> 43:15.560
Inside someone else's house. I and it's sorry. It started to get too much for me. I couldn't handle it. Yeah, I don't blame you

43:15.560 --> 43:24.560
I want to munch

43:27.160 --> 43:29.160
I want to munch

43:31.520 --> 43:34.280
In there, I didn't mean to be Dracula I was like

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
It's Italian. Oh

43:37.320 --> 43:41.760
I try to make it sound like Italian. Yeah, that's awesome, man. Wait, it's Dracula not Italian

43:41.760 --> 43:44.680
I'm Dracula Transylvania, but oh

43:45.280 --> 43:49.760
Right, right, right. Yeah garlic thing would have been a bigger deal. Yeah

43:50.560 --> 43:53.480
Okay, a new temptation is born

43:54.600 --> 43:59.760
The passionate kiss burger to enjoy. Oh, no say that ten times again

44:00.240 --> 44:04.800
The passionate kiss burger to enjoy with every bite. Is it brought to you by Gene Simmons?

44:05.640 --> 44:07.640
Hmm. What restaurant do you think is brought to you by?

44:08.080 --> 44:10.080
Mmm. Oh good question

44:10.080 --> 44:12.080
I'm gonna say

44:12.680 --> 44:14.680
hmm Red Robin

44:15.440 --> 44:17.440
interesting Griffin

44:17.440 --> 44:19.440
the passionate kiss burger

44:20.120 --> 44:23.880
Passionate kiss burger. It's got to be not one of the main ones

44:23.880 --> 44:28.600
I feel like it's gotta be a wild one like Dairy Queen or something like that. Oh, no, wait, hold on

44:28.600 --> 44:31.120
I'm gonna say Olive Garden because you said Italian earlier

44:32.920 --> 44:37.880
No, I mean literally Italian a new irresistible temptation

44:37.880 --> 44:45.200
Stemming from the creativity of Colonel Sanders. Why kiss burger now available in all KFC restaurants in Italy?

44:45.400 --> 44:48.500
Whoa, whoa is a chicken sandwich

44:49.480 --> 44:54.060
It's a bad start Italy, but go on a chicken sandwich for your burger

44:54.760 --> 44:58.560
Prepared according to the Colonel's original and secret recipe

44:59.640 --> 45:01.640
topped with double cheddar cheese

45:02.400 --> 45:03.960
crunchy bacon and

45:03.960 --> 45:10.720
Two delicious onion rings great. Enjoy every bite with the passion of a kiss because pleasure

45:11.400 --> 45:17.200
Knows no obstacles. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, not even topped with onions now Justin

45:17.200 --> 45:20.280
I I want you to know I listened to every word you just said

45:21.000 --> 45:28.000
Mm-hmm. Are you telling me that the entirety of the name passionate kiss burger?

45:28.360 --> 45:30.360
Yeah is a lie

45:30.360 --> 45:38.520
No, because it is neither a burger nor has anything to do with a passionate kiss except that one might enjoy it

45:39.080 --> 45:41.080
With the passion of a kiss

45:41.360 --> 45:46.680
Yes, this is what I'm saying. It's a sandwich that break that is a kiss kiss burger

45:46.680 --> 45:51.600
What part of that don't you not understand in the advertising film? And yes, it is a film

45:52.080 --> 45:59.560
Colonel Sanders talks about the new burger in all its delicacy a sandwich that brings you closer that unleashes passion for kisses

45:59.560 --> 46:01.560
in couples of all ages

46:01.960 --> 46:08.200
Ethnicities and sexual orientations with onions on it. Yeah, the launch campaign of the new burger

46:08.880 --> 46:13.960
Plays with the cliche of the onion. Oh, which could turn people away after eating it

46:14.440 --> 46:19.000
But Colonel Sanders recipe is so good that it has the opposite effect

46:19.760 --> 46:21.760
everybody the sandwich triggers the

46:21.760 --> 46:29.700
Desire to share and rediscover the pleasure of being together. That's from Paulo Tofano head of marketing and communications

46:29.980 --> 46:31.980
at KFC Italia

46:33.180 --> 46:37.760
Is it a sorry you I I think I law I didn't pay attention there for about

46:38.380 --> 46:44.420
Interest record three quarters of a second and now I don't know if this is a movie or a chicken burger

46:45.420 --> 46:48.660
Right, so it's both. It's a sort of transmedia

46:48.660 --> 46:56.380
Experience where it's kind of a burger that they've adapted into an advertising film. Yeah a 30-second advertising film, right?

46:57.140 --> 47:01.300
Once again, we wanted Colonel Sanders as the protagonist of the commercial

47:01.780 --> 47:07.540
He is the best testimonial for the message. We want to continue to share at KFC

47:07.580 --> 47:13.760
We are all the same and invited to enjoy the chicken. Okay at KFC

47:13.760 --> 47:19.160
We're all the same and invited to enjoy the chicken. I love that

47:19.160 --> 47:25.720
That's the atmosphere the sharing and welcoming experience that we offer in our restaurants

47:26.200 --> 47:27.640
also

47:27.640 --> 47:34.760
Debunking some cliches like the one about onions. Is that a cliche though? What's the onion cliche?

47:34.760 --> 47:36.760
They do make your breath stinky

47:36.760 --> 47:44.220
It's but the recipe of passion for this burger. That's chicken is so powerful. Yeah that it gets you

47:45.040 --> 47:46.560
fucking

Man, we'll probably tweet it out and include an episode lazy stuff

49:34.120 --> 49:36.800
It's like a very only commercial on a bash

49:36.800 --> 49:42.480
At least this is not like your sidelong glances or you're in plot people are full-on

49:43.160 --> 49:45.160
tonguing

49:45.160 --> 49:51.760
Tonguing hard. Yeah, this is like kfc is trying to establish itself as like the new like make out spot

49:52.040 --> 49:58.440
That like oh, hey eat this burger get totally revved up and then taste each other's tonsils

49:58.440 --> 50:02.160
my dude is this now I understand why they're all like

50:03.160 --> 50:07.320
Talking about how onions have a bad taste and smell to them

50:07.480 --> 50:12.600
Yeah, because they're assuming that you are going to be chowing down on your partner's face

50:12.600 --> 50:20.640
Moments after consuming this big because it's not a burning because of consuming Griffin that is important. This is not like

50:21.520 --> 50:27.800
This is not the the burger is not superfluous to the experience but rather integral

50:28.160 --> 50:34.860
Without it. You are not going to be chowing down on each other's faces. Yeah. Hey cool commercial

50:35.140 --> 50:40.680
Did we talk about the fact that there's about a thousand scenes of people kissing like deeply deeply kiss

50:40.680 --> 50:44.600
Just one couple mind you a lot of couples. Maybe they

50:46.360 --> 50:48.260
They're like they love the burger flavor

50:48.260 --> 50:50.260
They're kissing the burger at the same time

50:50.440 --> 50:57.000
Like it's one of those like cool three-way kisses that you see in like cool movies that people do where it's like me

50:57.520 --> 51:04.400
My my beautiful wife and a chicken burger in between us with the stinkiest onions. I've ever been close to in my life

51:05.040 --> 51:10.600
But I do like the idea of each other stinky breath making it. Okay, right? We're eating the same burger

51:10.600 --> 51:17.940
So, you know what? We're all the same here at KFC. Everybody's breath is stinky. So let's just enjoy it and get into it. Yeah

51:19.200 --> 51:22.960
Cool commercial juice. Thanks for sharing that with us. Yeah, it's very good

51:23.160 --> 51:27.980
It doesn't look like a very good sandwich, but fuck you, but I would eat the hell out of that

51:28.040 --> 51:32.440
It looks good as hell. I'm really hungry though. Yeah, that's also true. It's about lunchtime here

51:32.920 --> 51:40.080
It's also really funny because there's 319 comments on this video that's been viewed 6,000 times, which is quite a huge ratio

51:40.080 --> 51:42.080
that's what

51:43.600 --> 51:45.600
KFC Italia has

51:46.280 --> 51:53.080
Put a comment on the on the top of it. That's like hey everybody, please be nice

51:55.200 --> 52:00.780
It's like can't see you have the power to turn correct comments off and can't see like no no no everybody gets there

52:00.780 --> 52:05.120
So you must be treatment speech, but be cool. Just please be cool

52:05.120 --> 52:10.540
Um, man, that was a good that I never want to I don't ever want to kiss again

52:11.040 --> 52:15.480
It's one of those things where it's like, oh, I'm think I'm done. I have I've had my fill

52:15.680 --> 52:23.120
They don't address choking hazards in this at all. Do they? Yeah. Hey, how come their colonel is maybe the handsomest?
