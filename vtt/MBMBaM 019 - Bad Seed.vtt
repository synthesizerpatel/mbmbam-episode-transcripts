00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind on the first in line, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
If we're on the distance, even the band is watching me.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
So don't masturbate, or we'll see it. We see everything.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
We've always been watching you, from the time you were born to today.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
And we'll watch you for like a week after you die.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm just gonna go ahead and stay out of this one.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
Travis is staying out. This is a song about my brother, my brother and me.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
It's syncopated so you know we worked a long time on it.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Justin, when are you going to auto tune that shit?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
It's all been auto tuned. I did that in post.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
I say that knowing Griffin edits the show and probably didn't put it into auto tune.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
This is an advice show for the modern era.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
My brother, my brother and me. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm Griffin McElroy, and I'm not related to you.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
He don't like labels.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't subscribe to labels or podcasts, but I do subscribe to Reader's Digest.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
Label cubby holes in preschools, not people. That's what I say.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I actually couldn't exist without labels.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Triangular hole.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Whoa, this got deep.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I've got that memento disease.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh, you got memento.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Mementitis.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Do you mean that clean slate disease?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
You remember that?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Jerry Doody disease.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Holy shit, clean slate. Why did you remind me that existed?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Sorry.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Dear my brother, my brother and me, what do you do when your brother reminds you that clean slate existed?

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
You stop what you're doing, you rush out and you rent it from your local movie max.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Was it Dana Carvey?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yes.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I really can't remember.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
It was memento.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
It basically is memento.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
It's basically memento before memento is memento.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Hello, brothers, McElroy. I have one simple question.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
What is my brother, my brother and me stance on night showering as morning showers?

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
I tend to have a terrible morning hair and I use a shower as a double whammy of cleanliness and manageable locks.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Where do you stand?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I am totally right there with you.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
So this question is saying you take a shower at night and that counts as your morning shower when you wake up.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
So you don't have to shower before you go to work or school or whatever.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
There's nothing – why would you give up on that most energizing part of your day?

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
Like nothing gets me ready to say like, yes, let's do this like a morning shower.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
If I have one of those at night, my body is like, what are we doing?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
This is awesome.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Let's do something.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
This is going to be great.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
It's like, no, buddy, go to bed, you dumb bitch.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
I tricked you again.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
First that's a trim and now this.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
You dumb motherfucker.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
You'll fall for anything.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
I tend to shower – this sounds like a joke but in the summer like three times a day.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah, I've never seen anything like that.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
Once in the morning because I get that funky bed head too and I'll just like hop in and rinse and then go on about my day.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
Travis gets a hairstyle that you'd pay hundreds if not thousands of dollars for in Hollywood.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, I have that amazing hair that people only dream about so there's that.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
But when you dream about it, it looks terrible the next day so you got to have another shower in the morning.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And then what do you just treat yourself to a midday?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
I don't know.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
What are you doing with your day?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
You're like, you don't be better than this standing underwater.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah, and I take one when I get home from work because I work hard building stuff.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
And then I take one before I go to bed so that I'm not all dirty when I get on my nice white sheets.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Hey, what are you doing in those four hours?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Between the second shower and third shower?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Between second and third shower, Bilbo.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Well, that's me time.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Travis lives a lifestyle that a lot of us aren't, we just can't wrap our minds around.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Let's just say handmade jelly braces aren't going to hand make themselves, okay?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Where do you think all these lanyards come from?

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
If you only, if you can only have one though, night shower or morning shower.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
It's got to be morning shower.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I think it's got to be morning shower.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
If only because bed bugs are really big right now.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Everyone's got them.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
The latest thing.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Everyone's got those bed bugs.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
You know who I heard had them?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
You got to use them in the morning.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
You got to use a shower and eradicate them from your body.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
Don't even go to Hollywood if you don't have a Twitter account with at least a thousand followers and bed bugs.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
This is just that style today.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
That's where we're at as a nation.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Have you ever seen a bed bug?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I've seen Joaquin Phoenix.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He's a bed bug.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
He's a bed bug.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
He's a hyper evolved bed bug.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Hey guys.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Hey guys.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
So when I got married, I discovered that my in-laws asked their children and children-in-law for Christmas wish lists.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Every time I fill it out and mail it in, I feel like a kidnapper handing over a list of demands.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
I mean, it's nice to get DVDs and board games I know I like, but the spontaneity is completely lost.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Am I right for feeling awkward or am I just being ungrateful?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Thanks, fellas.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
You really know how to rock and roll.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Lehman, Gmail.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Thanks, Lehman.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
I've been in this exact same situation.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
That is how my in-law family rolls.

06:22.000 --> 06:32.000
And what I've done for the past few years is that I've just asked for a bunch of different styles and sizes of my brother, my brother and me t-shirts.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
And I feel like it's a gift that's not only fun to get, but also to give.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And it makes me feel better about it.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
I feel like since we're on the subject, let's have a brief aside just for a moment.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
You got your t-shirt.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I did.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
You may be the first human.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
I may be the first human to have my t-shirt.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Can you describe it?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Describe the whole experience of it, really.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I opened it and it smelled like a t-shirt.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And then I put it on.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
How does it feel?

06:59.000 --> 07:08.000
It was a comical line of girls out my front door, just one after the other, just like, please, anything.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Can I smell your chest?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Can I smell your chest?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
New from Max Body Spray t-shirts.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Would you describe it as soft or rough and confident?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
No, it's soft.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
It's soft and it's got a nice little stretch to it.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Oh, yeah?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, so it's really comfortable.

07:26.000 --> 07:34.000
My wife got one, too, and since she got it, I had to change my full-time career to full-smashing,

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
because I just got to smash so many fools who come up and they're like, hey, lady, nice taste in t-shirt.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Actually, this is true.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
She worked to get her hair did, and when she got back, I said, did you tell her about your t-shirt?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Did you explain it to her?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Did you tell her about the show?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
What's the point of you going out in public with it if you're not going to do that?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
But those are coming now.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
They should be arriving this week.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
And soon to follow are ask me about my t-shirt bumper stickers.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Ask me about the t-shirt I'm wearing.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
Unless it's those 29 days of the month that I'm not wearing my brother and me t-shirt.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I have good news.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Tell me.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
No, I'm saying that's what I'm saying when asked about the t-shirt.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
So those are going right now.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
You can still totally get them.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
We have all sizes and shapes and colors at mbnbam.com.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
But so Lehman to answer your question, but Lehman.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Here's the thing.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
You're there in law, dude.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
They don't know you.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
They don't know what exactly.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
You got to get people who do lists.

08:39.000 --> 08:47.000
From what I found are people who like to keep the balance of like how much they're spending on people.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
So like you have to accept the fact that they're going to spend X amount of dollars on you anyway.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
And it will make them happy to get you things that you will like.

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
So like you're you're you're meeting them halfway on this because think about when you're trying to buy a gift for somebody you don't know very well.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
It is the worst.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
You're like, well, they like this.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Will this be too personal?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
You're basically just saving them a lot of trouble.

09:10.000 --> 09:18.000
And I have friends and I have friends to this day that for like Christmas and birthdays, all they get is like a big stack of gift cards.

09:18.000 --> 09:27.000
That's like I would much rather give someone a list and actually get things in boxes and paper than just a big stack of gift cards.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Because that's like saying, hey, you do the shopping.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Hey, go go nuts.

09:31.000 --> 09:46.000
And really, what's what is more awkward, you turning in a list of demands of things that they will get you that, you know, you will like or them buying you like a build your own brick pizza oven kit because they saw you eating pizza one time.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
And then you have to like it and then build it in your backyard.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Put on the list. You've already given me the greatest gift, which is your daughter.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
But if you insist on getting me something else and then just do that every year, you'll never feel bad about it.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
And and always put on there just over and over again.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
The Ewok playset. If you don't give me this, I'll hate you forever.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Thanks for the daughter and everything. But I would really like that.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
But seriously, indoor playset, that would take her place as the greatest gift.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Hi, my name is God.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
That play several times and shit.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
I have a net. I have a life conundrum, says Ben.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I'm going into high school and I like a girl a lot.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I know that homecoming is going to be coming up.

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
So I want to ask her, this is an issue of not of her not liking me having good looks or me not having the balls to do it.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I just want to be creative when I ask her.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Sadly, my creative juices haven't been flowing and I need an idea.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Got any?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Don't do it at school.

10:44.000 --> 10:55.000
I feel like because you run a high school such a tightrope of cultural acceptance that I think you run the risk of embarrassing her.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
If you do anything outlandish at school.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
That's my stance.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Maybe he only sees her at school.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Put a dead horse head in her locker.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
See, I like that.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
The trick is kids lockers today, they're so small.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
So it's really just going to have to be a pony head.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
So put a pony head in there.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Which may be upsetting for her.

11:18.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah, or OK, gain access to all the lockers around her and install all the parts of a pony into the locker so that when they're all open together, it's a pony that says, will you go to homecoming with me?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
But also it's dead.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
But also it's dead.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Like it's dead as fuck.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Nobody's ever been dead in this way.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
It's like it's like quadricected in the several, several parts.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Octosected.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Have you ever thought about a large quartet?

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
You considered a large quartet.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I say.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, I guess it's so hard.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
High school was so long ago.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
I feel like that was one hundred and fifty thousand years ago for me.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
You know, I asked hijack a pep rally.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Oh, wow.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I like this.

12:05.000 --> 12:13.000
Turn it on its ear from being about the success of the basketball team and instead turn into a romantic opportunity.

12:13.000 --> 12:21.000
Say it would be a slam dunk if I could get to third base with you after the homecoming dance.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
But first you have to go with me.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
So let's get it started.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And then play the Black Eyed Peas song.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Let's get it started.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And then have a cheer routine.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
A one man cheer routine worked out to it.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
This sounds good.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Make her a mix CD.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Make her a mix CD of all Black Eyed Peas.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
I've got a feeling homecoming is going to be a good night.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
We're going to go to Applebee's.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
Then we'll dance to rap music from three years ago.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Request stroke and they don't play it.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Greatest dance night ever.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
There's a lot of music in this episode.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
It's like a musical episode.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I think it's closest we're ever going to get.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Hey, I've got a Yahoo Answers question.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Please, do tell.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
It comes to us from Robert Allen Cullen, which is a bad start.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
That's not a good start, but keep going.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
What would I have to do to become a wizard?

13:20.000 --> 13:28.000
I would like to become either a vampire or a wizard and I haven't gotten anything too promising on becoming a vampire.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
So I would like some information, some steps to take to become a wizard.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Well Robert, I'm glad you asked.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
I have some pamphlets here that I think you might be interested in.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
Not about wizard, but I run an anti-Harry Potter school that teaches kids that their magic is shameful.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Have you thought about the magic of our Lord and Savior?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Jesus Christ, he means.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Have you thought about that magic?

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
I think when a lot of people hear the word wizard, they think magic.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Or Star Wars episode one.

14:01.000 --> 14:10.000
There are a lot of elements of the wizard lifestyle that I think you can adopt without knowing how to cast magic.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Step one, beard.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Beard up day one.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Beard?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Naked day two.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Naked day two because you're a wizard.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Save something.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
A long robe?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah, a long robe.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You need a familiar?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
How are your sleeves?

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
By the way, everybody in class, your little brother doesn't count as your familiar.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Way to put the effort into it.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Not.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Not at all.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And don't spray paint your cat.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It seems like a good idea at first.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Just spend the extra money and get the black cat with all the extras.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
It's worth it for the features.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
Like that tail you can crank to cast spells.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
You need to capture some villagers and lock them in your basement.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Oh, you're going like Evil Wiz.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
No, no, no.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I mean, that's a natural.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Have you not read Harry Potter?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
I think you might have been reading maybe like an offshoot series.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
Did you check these out on Harry Potter.info slash fan stories?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I actually, I read Helter Skelter.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
That's my bad.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
That's on me.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
That's on you.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
So is the theory we're working on here that if you have all the trappings of wizardry and you do all the things that magic powers just come,

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
like you wake up one morning and your beard is just long enough and so you can do things?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Yeah.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Have you ever seen The Santa Clause?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Yes.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Clause spelled C-L-A-U-S-E as in like a legal clause.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Uh huh.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Whoa, this is already funny.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
It's kind of.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Slow down.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I didn't make it past the title.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
God, Tim Allen, you know, he knows exactly where my funny bone is.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Like surgical stride style.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
And what I love is that really opens it up for sequels.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Mm hmm.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Mm hmm.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
How old is too old to wear skinny jeans for fellows?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Jared asks.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Well, Jared, what age are you?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Because that age.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
This is like asking when, you know, when a fetus is a fetus, when is it a baby?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Because the answer is at conception.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
Now, if you got a fetus wearing skinny jeans, we are down with this.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
That's the coolest maybe ever.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, but we've already come out in favor of babies wearing hipster jeans.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
I feel like you skinny jeans.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
I say screw it, man.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
If that look works for you, just go for it.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
I was about to say 30, but like I'm almost 30 and I wear skinny jeans on the reg.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
It's all about what signal you want to send out, Jared.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
If you want to send out the signal that you're like, someone's not wearing those for comfort.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
They're wearing those because they want to make an impression on people.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And you're saying, hey, I'm putting the effort into it.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
What's up?

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
I want my fanny meat to look like some grade A material.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I want it.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
And I want it out there on display.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm not ashamed to wear pants that lift and separate.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
I want to advertise as much as Scott Pilgrim has been advertised.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I want it out there like SP.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Hey, hey, come get this butt.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Hey, did you see now?

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
I think you're crossing into a different signal that you might not want to be sending.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Hey, you want some butt?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
I've got some for you.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
This butt is yours.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Just kidding.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
It's mine.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
I keep it in these skinny jeans.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
You want a slice?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
This butt's for you.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Do you like some butt?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Who going to carve up this butt?

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
Who's going to carve up this butt for once?

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Several of my friends still dream big, says Jeff from Gmail.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And I have ideas for greater things.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And have ideas for greater things.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
One always has movie ideas.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Another has ideas for opening a cafe.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't think that's an idea.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And that's not even a particularly clever one.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
But anyway, moving on.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Me?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I don't recall having a good idea in years.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Years.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
What could I do to get them think meet sparks firing, says Jeff from Gmail.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
Jeff, the world can't be full of leaders.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
There's got to be someone who shows up on day one with a hammer and says, point me in

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
the right direction of your dream.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
Let me help you build it for an equitable share of the profits.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Jeff, let me take that one step further.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Every hero needs his arch nemesis.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
So hang out with these friends and every time they have an idea, you shoot it down.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
You poke holes in every single thing they say.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
They need a naysayer.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Right?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
So they can rub it in their face and be like, take that, Jeff.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
The thing is, one has movie ideas.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
The other one wants to open a cafe.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
I guarantee you those are both terrible ideas, whatever they are.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
And I guarantee you they will never, ever do those things, Jeff.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
You need to come up with like, like good practical ideas that you will actually use in your daily

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
life, like small victories.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Like I'm going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with waffles for bread.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Like, awesome idea, Jeff.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Go do that.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And then you got to you got like you only need one good idea.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Take Richie Napster.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
He came with the idea of like, fuck paying for music.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Fuck it.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
And look where he is today.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
I don't know where Richie Napster is today, but I mean, I'm sure he's got a lot of money.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
What about what about Google Jones?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Google Jones is another great example.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Just invent searching for shit.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
That guy had one good idea.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I want to find some things on the web.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
It's just a it's like a big stack of papers before that, just like piled on somebody's desk.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
And Google Jones is like, I need to find one of these papers.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And three people had a heart attack just hearing his idea.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Like, of course, of course, G.J.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
What did we think of this before?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
And they helped him build it.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
They helped him build a service, which actually is called Surcho.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
And someone was like, wait a minute.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Your first name is Googs.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Googs.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Googs, use your name.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Let's call it Jones.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Build on their ideas.

20:17.000 --> 20:28.000
If one has a movie about two buddy cops and they're like both hard nosed and but they're both former presidents.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Call it founding fighters.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
Like just come up with something something really dope that that that builds on their idea and just steal their idea.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah, I just steal it.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
That's a great idea.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Well, it's not so much open up a movie cafe.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
It's not so much stealing as much as it is like when you when you play Price is Right and you bet one dollar over what the person before you bet.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
So if they do a movie about two buddy cops, you do one about three buddy cops.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
That would be actually a really great movie.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
Or just the one cops in the back seat of the time going, can we get like a burger or something?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm really hungry.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.000
Maybe when you're maybe when like they tell them your ideas, combine them and then shoot them down together.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm going to make a movie about how your cafe is going to close.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
It will do very poorly in the box office.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Just like another movie I know about yours.

21:19.000 --> 21:30.000
Laura from Gmail had a had a story about her boyfriend arguing about condoms and whose job it is.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
And she basically asked, we've we've experienced the wide world of hookups and dating.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Whose job is it to provide the condoms?

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Laura, that's awfully presumptive of you.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
Griffin has taken a pledge to be chased until he he dates someone.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
TLW, ladies.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
TLW, true love waits.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah, the guys.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
See, I went a step further.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
OK, I had a condom surgically attached to my penis.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
Oh, God, God.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I just sometimes I just try to make Griffin sad.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
I yucked in my coffee cup.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
How does that?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
So you can use it once?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
No, that's the problem.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
He just keeps using it.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
If it actually gets punctured, it's considered a biological weapon.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
What is in there?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
What did you do?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
You killed 30 people.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Why are you standing with your pants around your ankle and a gas mask on?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
What are you doing?

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
I'm the new outbreak monkey.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I'm patient zero.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
My wiener is patient zero.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Are you wearing a fanny pack underneath your pants?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Are you wearing a fanny pack?

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh, I wish.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Oh, Jesus.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I wish I'd put the forethought into this.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
For a surgically attached condom.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
That's why it was an outpatient surgery.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
Now, here's my question, Travis.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Did Blue Shield cover that?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Part of it.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
It took a lot of paperwork.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah, I would imagine.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I had to convince him it wasn't elective.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
He got jealous of NuvaRings.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
He wanted a similar masculine alternative.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Just everyone should carry them.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
They give them to middle schoolers.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Just everyone provide them.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I'm confused.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
Doesn't everyone just have a box of six condoms that they had so long that they don't remember where they came from?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Yeah.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Doesn't everybody just have that?

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
I keep mine in an Altoids tin that has the words Jimmy Hats crudely scrawled upon it in Sharpies.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I got it in the fifth grade.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
A very sexually active ten-year-old.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
That's not true, Dad.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Hey, Laura.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Here's your answer.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Whose job is it?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Everyone's.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Be safe, kids.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Johnny B says, I thought you'd enjoy this tale.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
I was in Southwest PA a few weeks ago for my fiancee's family reunion.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
And while en route to said reunion, I passed a sign for a road called Jessup Street.

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
The completely mind-blowing thing was that some NBNB AM fan had put a hand-made sticker of the word Mega in front of Jessup.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Had I been driving, I would have pulled over for a snapshot.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And sadly, we took a different way home.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Hope you guys are doing great.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Johnny B.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Johnny B.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
I'm not sure that's true.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
That's totally true.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
I've always said our shit is poppin' in Southwest PA.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Yeah.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Southwest PA is probably like the epicenter.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
I heard they're having an NBNB AM convention in Southwest PA.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
It's called NBNB, N-B-P-A-M.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
There's a lot of weird letters in there.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Yeah.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Unfortunately, we weren't invited.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
No.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Because they know we would have said no.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
We have too many enemies.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
And they want to avoid that embarrassment.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Too many enemies in the Southwest PA area.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
God knows that's true.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
That's like what, Pittsburgh?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Is it?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
I think so.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
That's gross.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
If you're listening in Pittsburgh, I don't really think Pittsburgh is gross.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
If you're not listening in Pittsburgh, I totally do.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Fuck that, CD.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Yeah.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
And if you drive into Pittsburgh later, we don't think it's gross.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I don't want you to think you're wrong about things.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Because we're pretty much always right.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
FormSpring.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
I've known my best friend for eight years, but we never seem to talk about our feelings.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
We're both guys, so I guess that's normal.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
But I don't think we've ever hugged.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Not even once.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Oh, man.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
In tough times, we'd always use texts.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
What?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
What's the best way for us to open up?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
FormSpring.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm confused.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
You're having a rough day.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
And you're like, argh.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And then you text him, even though he's sitting right next to you.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Hey, Brad.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I'm too embarrassed to say this with my mouth.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
But you hurt my feelings.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
Now, first of all, let's get past that we're guys, so it's normal.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
That ain't normal.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Guys, open up.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Don't give in to the stereotype.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Love each other, man.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
What are you worried about?

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
I think everyone's allowed to have one.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Maybe not.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Allowed isn't the right word.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.840
Very organically, everyone develops one male friend that they can talk to about the lonely

26:22.840 --> 26:23.840
times.

26:23.840 --> 26:24.840
Yeah.

26:24.840 --> 26:25.840
Yeah.

26:25.840 --> 26:26.840
When they come.

26:26.840 --> 26:27.840
What are you worried about?

26:27.840 --> 26:28.840
That is my question.

26:28.840 --> 26:35.000
Like, if you're worried that people are going to think you're undercover gay, like, nothing

26:35.000 --> 26:39.440
screams undercover gay more than, I won't touch another man.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.800
That's like, wow.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.800
Self-hating.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.080
Jeff, there's a great idea for a movie, by the way.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.080
Yeah, Jeff.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.080
You what?

26:46.080 --> 26:47.080
Undercover gay.

26:47.080 --> 26:51.880
The sequel to Undercover Brother.

26:51.880 --> 26:57.360
I haven't talked about my feelings in close to 12 years, so I'm probably not the best

26:57.360 --> 26:58.360
person to feel this way.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.360
Just bottle it up.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.360
Bottle it up.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.240
Okay, here's my answer.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.880
Just at a really random time, just hug him.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.760
Just grab him and hug him and whisper in his ear, don't let this be weird.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.680
Perhaps at a ball game.

27:12.680 --> 27:13.680
Yeah.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.960
I like that.

27:14.960 --> 27:20.400
Or maybe you're sitting front row watching Chris Kattan in Undercover Gay, and you just

27:20.400 --> 27:22.960
hug him and think, I love you.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.240
Thanks for getting me out of the house, Brad.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.240
Come get this.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.240
Hug.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.880
Come get what I made.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.880
Come in here.

27:29.880 --> 27:30.880
Come in here.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.000
Hey, Brad, how do these skinny jeans look?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Give me a hug.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
I got you this hug.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Now carve this butt.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Carve my butt, Brad.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.040
Carve it.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.040
If you didn't-

27:43.040 --> 27:44.040
Not in a gay way, though.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.040
Not in a gay way.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.040
Just carve my butt like in a straight, just bros way.

27:48.040 --> 27:51.800
If you didn't answer my question on the show, will you respond eventually, says FormSpring.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.120
Oh, boy.

27:53.120 --> 27:58.640
Hey, folks, you can still put your name on the FormSpring question, okay?

27:58.640 --> 28:01.080
Here's my suggestion.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.080
Send it again.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.080
Whoa.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.080
Yeah.

28:04.080 --> 28:08.520
You're putting yourself up to a lot of work, isn't it?

28:08.520 --> 28:10.680
I'm a man who lives in the now, Justin.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.120
Yeah, lives today.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.800
I don't worry about what happened yesterday or even three seconds ago.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.800
What?

28:16.800 --> 28:19.360
I have that memento disease.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.400
I have mementitis.

28:21.400 --> 28:27.360
Yeah, if it's still pressing, if you really need help, send it again.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.440
We'll see what we can do.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.560
But otherwise, probably not.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.560
Probably not.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.560
We get a lot every week.

28:32.560 --> 28:33.560
We do.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.800
I was thinking that we could- We read them all.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.800
We do read them all.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.800
We promise that.

28:38.800 --> 28:45.360
But I was thinking that what we could do is find one blanket answer that we can apply

28:45.360 --> 28:53.340
to just large swaths of questions that are similar.

28:53.340 --> 28:58.600
Maybe not one blanket answer, but a handful of blanket answers to some of our most commonly

28:58.600 --> 28:59.600
asked questions.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.600
Okay.

29:00.600 --> 29:05.160
Well, I call through a lot of the questions, so you want me to give you guys the questions

29:05.160 --> 29:06.840
and you give me the answer?

29:06.840 --> 29:08.220
I don't even think we need the questions.

29:08.220 --> 29:15.120
I think we can just say the answers and the people who ask the questions will know.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.840
I've got one.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.800
Just kiss her, dummy.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.200
Yeah, just kiss her, dummy.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.200
Yeah.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.360
Wow, that takes care of a lot of it, doesn't it?

29:26.360 --> 29:27.360
Just quit already.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.480
Oh, that's a good one.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.360
They're not really your friend.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.360
That's a big one.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.360
Horse radish.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.360
Oh, yeah.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.220
Just go to the doctor.

29:41.220 --> 29:44.960
It's not supposed to look like that.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.280
Those two are often conjoined.

29:47.280 --> 29:51.480
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots.

29:51.480 --> 29:54.480
That covers everything, right?

29:54.480 --> 29:57.360
Yeah, that's just about it.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.120
I have one more, stop talking about masturbation, you freak.

30:01.120 --> 30:04.120
You're freaking everybody out, weirdo.

30:04.120 --> 30:09.280
We asked, we asked so nicely, don't be creepy anymore, and the next, the fucking next week

30:09.280 --> 30:13.640
it was like, hey, I made a poop and masturbated it.

30:13.640 --> 30:14.640
Both rules.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.360
Hey, I masturbated my poop.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.040
Is that cool?

30:19.040 --> 30:22.080
I made a poop and I masturbated on my poop and then I looked at it.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.080
Here's a picture.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.080
Deal with it, homes.

30:26.080 --> 30:33.000
I seem to have a lot of trouble making and maintaining eye contact with other people

30:33.000 --> 30:34.160
during conversations.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.160
Any advice?

30:35.160 --> 30:37.560
Oh my God, I do the same thing.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.560
Yeah, me too.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.560
I don't have advice.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.320
No, here's what, I need your advice.

30:42.320 --> 30:49.000
I've cultivated like this, I look off of their shoulders and try to look really thoughtful

30:49.000 --> 30:54.720
and pensive so they're thinking, oh, he's having big ideas, but really I'm bored.

30:54.720 --> 30:55.720
I make up for it though.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.440
Hey Travis, hey Travis, that's somebody who's known you for your entire life.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.880
We're onto you.

31:00.880 --> 31:06.520
I make up, I make up for my lack of eye contact by keeping a constant physical contact with

31:06.520 --> 31:08.840
everyone I ever talk to.

31:08.840 --> 31:12.280
Either just have a hand on the cheek, just a hand on the cheek, just constantly brushing

31:12.280 --> 31:18.240
hair away from their eyes and behind their ears or, or holding their hands or giving

31:18.240 --> 31:21.560
them like a light massage.

31:21.560 --> 31:27.360
Here's what you need to do, just unwavering eye contact, intense, burning.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.120
You're testing yourself, remember?

31:29.120 --> 31:35.220
And if they try to look away, you start screaming, don't look away, don't look away.

31:35.220 --> 31:39.080
It's like a firm handshake staring somebody down and it's important that you establish

31:39.080 --> 31:40.640
that dominance, I think.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.640
Yeah.

31:41.640 --> 31:45.180
I need help learning how to cook, says Thomas from Gmail.

31:45.180 --> 31:50.000
The only thing I know how to cook is the, that's what it sounds like when I say quotations.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.840
It's microwavable foods and tasty sandwiches, but it's good.

31:56.840 --> 32:01.160
I have mastered both of these cooking techniques, but I need to know how to cook actual meals.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.900
I'm getting to the point where I'll move out and live on my own soon.

32:03.900 --> 32:06.960
Are there any recipes or websites you can recommend to me?

32:06.960 --> 32:09.400
Thank you for the help, says Thomas from Gmail.

32:09.400 --> 32:14.440
Before we get into funny things, I have a real answer that started my cooking journey.

32:14.440 --> 32:18.800
There's a series of books called A Man, A Can and a Plan, A Man, A Can and a Microwave

32:18.800 --> 32:21.400
and A Man, A Can and a Grill.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.400
Find these books.

32:22.400 --> 32:26.560
They're all like six ingredient recipes that take about 15 minutes.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.280
They are delicious and they are impressive.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.560
Go buy these books.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.260
And they will give you diabetes.

32:33.260 --> 32:36.000
And they will, they will give you the diabetes.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.120
You know, it really is about, is about just trying it.

32:40.120 --> 32:44.920
I mean, what you can do is watch, you watch Food Network and just pick something that

32:44.920 --> 32:47.360
looks fairly easy and just, just try it.

32:47.360 --> 32:51.040
And if, if you are a novice, Good Eats spells it out very plainly.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.040
It's very scientific.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.040
Yeah, Good Eats.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.600
And Alton Brown writes some good books.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.080
You can check those out.

32:56.080 --> 33:00.920
Otherwise I will say pasta, pasta is easy to make.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.240
So, so easy.

33:02.240 --> 33:07.680
You make like noodles and you buy some sauce, comes pre-pro and then you, you dump the sauce

33:07.680 --> 33:08.680
on the noodles.

33:08.680 --> 33:14.020
Maybe some, some vegetables that you can steam in like a bag and a microwave.

33:14.020 --> 33:16.400
See you're using the skills you already possess.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.160
Also, you know who, you know what's great?

33:19.160 --> 33:23.280
Search on YouTube for starving with Lewis.

33:23.280 --> 33:31.320
That's a friend of mine who does, he does sort of like college cooking, but it's sort

33:31.320 --> 33:39.560
of like that, like evolving from ramen and stuff to, to, to not ramen.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.320
And he's got suicide girls in there sometimes.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.920
So it's good stuff.

33:42.920 --> 33:43.920
For the fellas.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.840
If you want anything else, pick out an ingredient that you're interested in.

33:46.840 --> 33:50.720
Like I bought this eggplant and then go online and search eggplant recipes.

33:50.720 --> 33:54.120
But make sure whenever you, whenever you announce that ingredient, you do it like the guy from

33:54.120 --> 33:55.120
Iron Chef.

33:55.120 --> 34:00.680
Especially if you're alone in your kitchen, that will make, that will make the learning

34:00.680 --> 34:05.320
times horse or standing in the middle of the supermarket.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.960
Just go down the road and take a bite out of it.

34:07.960 --> 34:16.640
I want to hear Griffin's last question, it's always a doozy, but a few housekeeping things.

34:16.640 --> 34:20.640
You can, if you want to ask a question, you can log on to nbmbam.com.

34:20.640 --> 34:23.840
We have all the methods there.

34:23.840 --> 34:30.080
We we're going to get a new site soon, hopefully we're working on that right now for you.

34:30.080 --> 34:35.500
If you have any requests, you could of course email them to nbmbam at gmail.com.

34:35.500 --> 34:39.760
There are still plenty of t-shirts if you'd like to purchase those.

34:39.760 --> 34:46.440
The logo t-shirt we'll probably keep making some version of.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.320
The Jeffrey t-shirt, not so much.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.320
Limited-ish.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.320
Limited-ish.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.880
So, if you want one, get it.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.920
Is there anything else?

34:55.920 --> 34:56.920
Thanks, thank you.

34:56.920 --> 35:00.480
Oh my god, thank you so much.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.200
We're nearing up on 200,000.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.400
Last week was our biggest download day by like a thousand.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.400
I don't know what happened.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.400
You guys are nuts.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.400
But you guys killed it.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.640
You guys knocked it out of the water.

35:11.640 --> 35:22.160
And we really appreciate everybody dropping quotes and just promoting the show, helping

35:22.160 --> 35:24.200
out.

35:24.200 --> 35:30.720
Twitter user MyBeautifulLiar helped spread the word this week.

35:30.720 --> 35:36.240
Tony Lemon, he's out there doing God's work, telling people about NB&B AM.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.240
We appreciate it.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.240
Seriously, you guys have no idea.

35:39.240 --> 35:46.000
I would like to thank my friend Alex Goodrich, sent me a question from WikiLinks, Wiki, excuse

35:46.000 --> 35:50.280
me, WikiAnswers that I think is going to be a whole new venue that we can travel down.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.280
So I wanted to say thank you for that.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.280
Oh boy.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.280
Can't wait for that.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.280
Uh oh.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.280
Uh oh.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.400
And if you get a second, if you wouldn't mind subscribing on iTunes if you haven't already

35:58.400 --> 36:03.400
done that and leaving a rating or a review on iTunes, because when you do that, it helps

36:03.400 --> 36:08.360
us move up the iTunes rankings, which helps even more people find our show.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.360
Just if you get a second.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.440
I know you're busy, but.

36:10.440 --> 36:13.000
And tell everybody to download it on Monday.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.040
And when we do that, we go up.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.760
That's good.

36:16.760 --> 36:21.960
Because that's the only way we're going to get huge.

36:21.960 --> 36:27.640
And start contacting your local NPR station and asking them why they don't carry our

36:27.640 --> 36:29.360
show up on that shit.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.360
Yeah.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.080
And ask your local county commission why they don't have an official My Brother My Brother

36:33.080 --> 36:34.960
Me day while you're at it.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.400
Just think about it.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.400
Griffin.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.400
Gracious.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.520
This, uh, this Yahoo answers question.

36:42.520 --> 36:49.560
It was sent in by fan of the show Declan, which is just really, really cool.

36:49.560 --> 36:50.560
Oh, oh wait.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.400
Before you read it, I got a letter from Tristan.

36:53.400 --> 36:56.400
He's doing great, but it sounds terrible what he's doing.

36:56.400 --> 37:01.600
It sounds really hard, but I guess boot camp really tough boot camp really tough, but Tristan's

37:01.600 --> 37:02.920
doing well for people.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.400
You can write him.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.200
I think his address is in the Facebook group anyway.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.200
All right.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.200
Good.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.200
Sorry.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.200
Thank you, Tristan.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.200
Thank you, Tristan, for your service.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.200
Freedom.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.200
Thank you.

37:13.200 --> 37:16.960
And thank you, Declan, for your service of sending in this question.

37:16.960 --> 37:22.160
This one is from Yahoo answers user Chris.

37:22.160 --> 37:37.520
Who asks, how do I get help with the legalization of zoo file marriage?

37:37.520 --> 37:38.520
I'm Travis McElroy.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

37:39.520 --> 37:46.720
And this has been my brother, my brother and me kiss your dad, where on the lips you will

37:46.720 --> 38:04.000
never know me.

38:04.000 --> 38:24.880
Hey, everybody, sorry we forgot to mention it during the show, but Jay Phonic has a new

38:24.880 --> 38:32.960
jam, untitled, I think, but it's it's so fresh and and we have to put it in the show.

38:32.960 --> 38:38.200
So as a reward for sticking around a little post credits bonus.

39:02.960 --> 39:03.960
I got a question.

39:03.960 --> 39:04.960
How do you feel about man sized jaws?

39:04.960 --> 39:05.960
I'm the kind of boy that you don't have to push it very hard.

39:05.960 --> 39:06.960
Just pull out your telephone and put away your signal flags and I'll be there.

39:06.960 --> 39:07.960
Taste with my little bag.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
Baby girl, you wanna get down with my mega Jess up.

39:08.960 --> 39:09.960
Turn around, get on your knees and baby pull that dress up.

39:09.960 --> 39:10.960
I'm like Tristan, sweeping through for mankind.

39:10.960 --> 39:11.960
I love this lesbian.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.960
I'll kill them and shut down in no time.

39:12.960 --> 39:13.960
My rhymes are tight cause I'm infused with soul power.

39:13.960 --> 39:14.960
I'm like Jerry Matthews, man, playing all of them on the watchtower.

39:14.960 --> 39:15.960
And when I rock, I'm like, you know, I'm anything but simple.

39:15.960 --> 39:16.960
And girl, get your hands up on my wallet.

39:16.960 --> 39:17.960
If you don't like it, don't be shy.

39:17.960 --> 39:18.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

39:18.960 --> 39:41.960
Baby girl, you wanna get down with my mega Jess up.

39:41.960 --> 40:03.960
Turn around, get on your knees and baby pull that dress up.
