00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.320
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

00:46.320 --> 00:49.360
made an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.920
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.480
You know what that alarm sound means on my phone? Pony time!

00:58.480 --> 01:02.800
It's pony time, everybody. Welcome to the pony time segment of My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.160
This is the first time that we've properly called it that, although if you think about it,

01:06.160 --> 01:12.480
we've done pony time maybe 700 times in the 303 episodes we've done this show. Pony time is a

01:12.480 --> 01:17.840
special time of year where we talk about all the exciting horse races and the winners and just like

01:17.840 --> 01:23.440
what's new, what's happening in the whole pony industry. Obviously, the Kentucky Derby, which

01:23.440 --> 01:28.160
is what I call it, it's like a fun little pet name for it, has happened. And then of course,

01:28.160 --> 01:32.400
the Preakness wrapped up last week. I like to call it the Freakness. Okay.

01:33.840 --> 01:39.040
Because I'm really excited about it. I get really freaked out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then of course,

01:39.040 --> 01:42.080
I think the Churchill Downs. I said of course, but I don't actually know. I think the Churchill

01:42.080 --> 01:48.080
Downs are today. There's no part of the pony time segment where I fact check stuff, and maybe we'll

01:48.080 --> 01:53.600
organically get to that point. But let's talk about the horses and what's going on. Nyquist,

01:53.600 --> 02:02.960
very, very exciting. I'm looking at the Kentucky Derby results here. Looks like Nyquist pulled off

02:02.960 --> 02:07.840
a commanding win. One and one quarters lengths ahead of Exaggerator, who I think we can all

02:07.840 --> 02:13.280
agree is a piece of shit. Yeah, he's fucking exaggerated. Nyquist sounds like it should be

02:13.280 --> 02:19.200
a sleepy horse. Because it sounds like Nyquil? Yeah. Well, it's actually a very, very fast horse

02:19.200 --> 02:23.040
is the thing. Very awake and fast. No, no. I mean, maybe it's an ironic thing like when you call a

02:23.040 --> 02:28.080
big guy tiny. I don't know if it's fast horses are getting so popular in these races now. Yeah.

02:28.080 --> 02:32.080
It definitely seems to be the trend. Back in my day, everyone used to just have slow artisanal

02:32.080 --> 02:37.360
horses. Yeah. Looks like, and of course, following them close behind four and a half horse lengths

02:37.360 --> 02:41.360
behind. By the way, that's a wonderful measurement. Can I use that for other things? And I just bought

02:41.360 --> 02:44.960
a new mattress. I wish I had thought to be like, I'm looking for one that's like three quarters

02:44.960 --> 02:51.680
horse length. It's kind of fun if you think about the fact that like those people also know about

02:51.680 --> 02:56.000
feet. Yeah. Like they all know about it. They know what they are. It's definitely some like cubit

02:56.000 --> 03:00.320
shit, right? Where it's just like, oh, it's the length of my arm. Like, well, what about his arm?

03:00.320 --> 03:05.840
Oh, it's the length of his arm too. Oh, okay. Some disappointing finishes in the Kentucky Derby,

03:05.840 --> 03:11.200
like Gunrunner, Mohamed, Sudden Breaking News, Brody's Cause. Brody's Cause is

03:12.880 --> 03:19.040
probably the best horse I've ever heard. Brody's Cause is more woven necklaces for everyone.

03:19.040 --> 03:25.600
There's Danzing Candy, not Dancing Candy, Oscar nominated, Majesto. Majesto is probably-

03:27.120 --> 03:29.840
Sounds like the one that we made up. Yeah. If there's one that we-

03:29.840 --> 03:33.920
Well, no, if we were to make one up, it would be like Mama's Exquisite Soup Recipe.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.040
That's true. That would be my horse. Majesto sounds like the horse couldn't decide between

03:37.040 --> 03:40.960
being a racer and being a magician. Let me just hop over to the previous results,

03:40.960 --> 03:46.480
see if Nyquist is still on that Triple Crown run and know that piece of shit exaggerator

03:46.480 --> 03:51.600
snuck in like a thief in the night, took it away. Nyquist got beat by a horse named Cherry Wine

03:51.600 --> 03:54.960
too. Nyquist finished third, Cherry Wine came in second. Cherry Wine didn't even fucking fight.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.360
Not fight, race. Well, it's kind of a fight. Didn't even fight in the Kentucky Derby. And

03:59.360 --> 04:05.040
at that point, it's like, why are you- If you're not even going to go for the Triple Crown,

04:05.040 --> 04:10.480
why the fuck are you here? I got the single crown. Go the fuck ho- I want to race and I

04:10.480 --> 04:15.040
kept the horse from getting the Triple Crown. Good job. You're a fucking troll at this point.

04:15.040 --> 04:20.720
Like let him, let him approach glory. Wait, Griffin, in your opinion, what's better?

04:20.720 --> 04:27.760
A Triple Crown earned or a Triple Crown given? Both are better than a Triple Crown stolen,

04:27.760 --> 04:31.200
which is what Cherry Wine did. And it's technically what Exaggerator did. Exaggerator,

04:31.200 --> 04:34.880
you lost the first race, dog. It's time to fucking get out of the race because you're not going to

04:34.880 --> 04:40.320
win the Triple Crown. Are you suggesting that if, if any horse that wins, like if a horse

04:40.320 --> 04:45.520
wins the first one, any horse that beats that horse after that is just like- A usurper to the

04:45.520 --> 04:49.600
third crown. Being a real dick. To the Triple Crown. Real dick in a crown blocker. Some

04:49.600 --> 04:54.240
disappointing finishes in the pregnants I'd like to go down, like Uncle Lino, Fellowship, Awesome

04:54.240 --> 04:58.960
Speed. All very good. Oh, that's like, that's painful, isn't it? To name a horse Awesome Speed

04:58.960 --> 05:04.880
and have it not finish. Yeah. In the top what, like three? Fucking dude finish ninth. It's okay,

05:04.880 --> 05:10.240
Speed. I'm actually, we've revised the horse's name in light of recent events. That was just

05:10.240 --> 05:14.480
called disappointment. I do want to talk about the, there were two very disappointing finishes

05:14.480 --> 05:20.560
in the Preakness and those were the two horses that were destroyed because they died. They died

05:20.560 --> 05:24.800
during the Preakness. There were two horses- At least one of them destroyed itself, right?

05:24.800 --> 05:28.880
It, both were destroyed and I don't want to joke about it too much because it's very, very, very

05:28.880 --> 05:38.000
sad. Again, that verb is not, it's, the verb is joyous. Yeah. But the act- It's triumphant,

05:38.000 --> 05:42.640
I would say. It's a triumphant, yeah. But like, the thing it describes is very, very sad but

05:43.360 --> 05:49.360
that's kind of a weird, kind of a weird ending to a sports event.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.560
Like, how was the Broncos game? Well, they lost and Peyton Manning died.

05:54.560 --> 06:01.200
In it, during it. How was it? How was, how was it? Oh, it was okay. Tony Romo,

06:01.200 --> 06:06.480
he fucking died. He threw so hard that his body ripped in half. He threw so hard,

06:06.480 --> 06:12.320
his heart just stopped and he died right, like literally right there on the 50 and then his team

06:12.320 --> 06:18.560
fucking lost. Couldn't even win one for the Romo. He died. I know that they pay really close

06:18.560 --> 06:23.520
attention to the genetics of a horse before they breed them. Yeah. Do you think that question comes

06:23.520 --> 06:30.000
up like, so will it be fast? Yeah. Yeah. Very, very fast. So fast. Will it be like a beautiful

06:30.000 --> 06:35.040
chestnut brown color? Oh, fuck yeah. Oh yeah, definitely. Definitely. Is there any chance of

06:35.040 --> 06:42.400
it just like racing really, like, you know how it's gonna run really fast? Any chance of it dying

06:42.400 --> 06:47.040
because of the speed at which it runs? I bet that the answer to that question is always this,

06:47.040 --> 06:53.360
well, there's always a chance. I mean, God could just take it. You know what I mean? That's what it

06:53.360 --> 06:59.520
is. God, God, the horses ran too fast and beautiful and God's like, not, not on the ground anymore.

06:59.520 --> 07:05.440
Time to race amongst the clouds. You're pulling my chariot now. Yeah. Now the saddest part is,

07:05.440 --> 07:10.080
uh, one of the horses that died, broke, broke its leg. Very, very sad. Was destroyed. It was a

07:10.080 --> 07:14.880
Promethea, four-year-old Philly, died on the, died on the track. Very, very sad. The other one,

07:14.880 --> 07:20.480
and this is even sadder, just died after winning a race, after winning a race, just like trotting

07:20.480 --> 07:25.840
on back to the stall, died just instantly standing up. That horse's name was Homeboy Chris.

07:25.840 --> 07:32.800
Can we fucking please, like, that's- Can we not spare the ones with the most beautiful names?

07:32.800 --> 07:39.600
Is that not- I also, I guess I say it is a tragedy that Homeboy Chris fell in the line of duty. It's

07:39.600 --> 07:45.600
sad when any, it's sad when any horse dies. Yes. But Homeboy Chris did win, which adds a little

07:45.600 --> 07:52.400
bit of an epic spin to like, you win your race and then like, back in your stall, you know,

07:52.400 --> 07:58.320
you close your eyes. Like that, there's a little bit of like, beauty to that. John Henry kind of-

07:58.320 --> 08:03.040
Yeah. Yeah, right? Beat the steam engine and then, yeah. I've seen a lot of controversy. There's

08:03.040 --> 08:07.120
been a lot, I've been following all the horse bloids and there's been a lot of controversy

08:07.120 --> 08:14.160
that the Pimlico race course where the Preakness is hosted had a muddy track situation. That might

08:14.160 --> 08:18.960
be why Nyquist didn't perform as well as everybody was expecting, but it also might be why two of the

08:18.960 --> 08:24.640
athletes died. How have you done the- Tell me about the choices you made while making the turf.

08:24.640 --> 08:30.800
They were apparently pretty bad choices because two of the athletes died. I also read at one point

08:30.800 --> 08:35.760
that the problem might be that like, the horse, at least one of them, already had a bunch of injuries

08:35.760 --> 08:40.720
and they just drugged it up real good so it could race good. Like, who's in charge of this shit?

08:40.720 --> 08:46.160
Is there not somebody who's going, wait, what did you do? Oh, hold on. Yeah, no, wait, what did you

08:46.160 --> 08:50.640
do? Get the fuck out. What's the other horse besides Homeboy Chris? It doesn't matter.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.880
Yeah, I just needed a name. Prometea. Prometea. Do you think there's a part, like, as sad as it is

08:56.880 --> 09:03.040
to lose Homeboy Chris, and I'm like, I'm still talking about it, nobody else, if Prometea is

09:03.040 --> 09:07.440
watching from beyond the beyond, there's got to be a little bit of relief on Prometea's part.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.600
Like, oh, thank god. I did not want to be the only horse that died at this thing because that would

09:11.600 --> 09:16.800
be a hot topic. And now, like, two died, it's like, maybe not our fault? Yeah, and at least now Prometea

09:16.800 --> 09:21.920
has the comfort of being, like, forever, like, a statistic. Like, well, there's one Preakness,

09:21.920 --> 09:28.000
two horses, same day. Same day. Like, that- Yeah. Doesn't that- This has got to be the worst

09:28.000 --> 09:36.720
Preakness, right? It requires definitely some, like, some kind of restructuring to your race program

09:36.720 --> 09:42.720
when two of the contestants die. I'm not sure what the criteria is for judging the success or failure

09:42.720 --> 09:48.880
of a Preakness organizer. I'm pretty sure two horses going on to meet their eternal reward

09:48.880 --> 09:54.880
is probably a demerit or two. We need to- If your fucking Preakness has a KD ratio,

09:54.880 --> 10:00.800
you fucked up, dog. If it were any other competition, like, how did the evening of

10:00.800 --> 10:06.080
Jeopardy go? Well, bad news. Two of the contestants dropped dead. Oh, well, we probably need to look at

10:06.080 --> 10:11.680
the buzzers or whatever because something's gone horribly wrong. Like, they were giving this guy

10:11.680 --> 10:18.160
the job description. They said, okay, listen, it's an easy gig. All you have to do is make a big circle

10:18.160 --> 10:22.720
that beautiful horses can run around on. And then the guy's, like, out the door and, like,

10:22.720 --> 10:28.480
as he's getting this car, they're like, oh, and don't let any of them die on it. What? Don't-

10:28.480 --> 10:35.920
No, listen, come back. Don't let your horses die on the circle. Okay, bye. Bye. Sounds good. Checks

10:35.920 --> 10:41.600
in the mail. It's the exciting- I put a bunch of holes in there. Goodbye. It's an exciting thing

10:41.600 --> 10:45.920
about horse racing, though, right? Because there can only be one winner, and there can only be one

10:45.920 --> 10:51.040
triple crown winner, and sometimes there's lots of zero triple crown winners, and the rest of the

10:51.040 --> 10:58.800
horses are losers. But then below that is a whole other strata of, like, super losers. I super lost

10:58.800 --> 11:08.320
the Preakness. I lost the Preakness arguably the most one can lose at any endeavor. Now, listen,

11:08.320 --> 11:13.280
I hope that nobody gets the wrong impression that thinks we think it's funny when horses die. No,

11:13.280 --> 11:17.280
it's the saddest thing ever. If you were watching- That would fuck you up if you were watching that.

11:17.280 --> 11:24.160
No way. I can't imagine. And we are respectful of it. I think I personally purchased the meat

11:24.160 --> 11:31.680
of Homeboy Chris to share with my family. No. Friends and family. No. No. Somebody should eat

11:31.680 --> 11:38.640
them, don't you think? Yeah. Like, very Dothraki, right? It is Dothraki. I mean, like, not the other

11:38.640 --> 11:45.920
horses. That seems weird. That's messed up. But maybe Homeboy Chris was the stallion that will

11:45.920 --> 11:52.320
mount the world or whatever and needs to be consumed by a child. I can't. It's been a long

11:52.320 --> 11:58.880
time since I read it. Listen, let's get to the advice. We wasted like fucking 10 minutes talking

11:58.880 --> 12:03.680
about that. That's what happens when you get us going on horses. Can we stop killing horses?

12:03.680 --> 12:06.800
Can we please just stop? Can we reign that in maybe a little bit? Also, side note, when the one

12:06.800 --> 12:11.040
that broke its leg broke its leg, it threw its rider and broke his collarbone. Let's look at

12:11.040 --> 12:15.760
this whole thing again, huh? Let's take it back to the start. If you're going to be humanist pieces,

12:15.760 --> 12:20.240
a shit about all this, then fine. There is a human cost, one collarbone. Now, of course,

12:20.240 --> 12:24.400
when that person broke their collarbone, I don't think anybody walked up to them and swiftly

12:24.400 --> 12:32.320
executed them. I don't think whoever was riding that pony was destroyed as well. I think they can

12:32.320 --> 12:36.960
still, like, use their other arm to eat a hot dog, which they probably did later that day because

12:36.960 --> 12:42.320
more is expected of them than just riding a horse. There's a more sort of cohesive human experience

12:42.320 --> 12:47.360
there beyond the track, and we didn't afford that opportunity to homeboy Chris. If anyone's

12:47.360 --> 12:53.440
listening and your horse breaks a leg and you're like, well, I'll take care of it. I'll fix that

12:53.440 --> 13:00.080
horse. I will sea biscuit the shit out of that horse. Just call me. Okay, okay. Now it's time

13:00.080 --> 13:03.440
for advice. I do want a horse, by the way, like legit. I've been thinking about it. But, like,

13:03.440 --> 13:07.040
one that has a leg that doesn't work so it can just, like, chill in my office and just, like,

13:07.040 --> 13:16.080
lay around. Right? Yeah. I got a significant couch in here. Yeah. All right. Tonight my boyfriend

13:16.080 --> 13:21.040
took me out for dinner at the OG after a long day at work. Ugh, always goes down good. It was lovely

13:21.040 --> 13:25.600
until we just hung out while we were trying to eat to tell us her life story. What? I went from

13:25.600 --> 13:33.680
acknowledging response to one-word answers to a laugh, a hmm, finally just nodding my head and

13:33.680 --> 13:38.240
hoping that each time she walked away it would be the last. She would finish the sentence,

13:38.240 --> 13:44.880
walk two steps, and step back to say more. Oh my god. We gasped about being late for a movie,

13:45.440 --> 13:51.760
paid, and booked out of there. Only the leftovers in the parking lot. How can we avoid this

13:51.760 --> 13:57.440
situation? Slash, what do I do to make it end? Slash, am I doomed to live an OG-less life?

13:57.440 --> 14:05.520
Please help ravenous Rebecca. There's a lot of variables here. I don't know if you were actually

14:05.520 --> 14:10.240
late for a movie or if you were just, like... Sounds like a scam. Yeah, sounds like maybe you're just

14:10.240 --> 14:18.160
dropping a line on it. Um, I don't think that this is... I don't think that this is necessarily

14:18.160 --> 14:25.120
so bad of a thing for a person to do. Like, talk to you and make a... We get so many questions

14:25.120 --> 14:30.320
coming coming from the other end of, like, uh... Well, we get less of them now because I think we've

14:30.320 --> 14:34.080
made our stance pretty clear of, like, I want to know more about this person working in a service

14:34.080 --> 14:39.520
industry, so how can I, like, talk to them? How can I... How can I become friends or, uh, how can I

14:39.520 --> 14:43.360
date this person who I know who works in the service industry? It's rare that we get it coming

14:43.360 --> 14:47.600
the other way where it's like this person in the service industry is coming on a little strong,

14:47.600 --> 14:51.600
but, like, I don't necessarily think... I know you came there to eat and you probably want to,

14:51.600 --> 14:56.320
like, eat and hang out. That's the... Griffin, that's the problem is there's three periods

14:56.320 --> 15:02.640
to a meal at a restaurant. Before your food, during your food, and after your food. And before

15:02.640 --> 15:08.720
and after, they can talk to me all they want, but once the food is there and I'm supposed to actively

15:08.720 --> 15:18.320
be engaging my talking hole with food, don't talk to me. Like... This is absolutely untenable. I...

15:18.320 --> 15:28.640
This is absolutely... Like, I'm sorry, there's no... Okay, I have a daughter. She'll be two in August,

15:28.640 --> 15:37.360
okay? If I am at dinner with my wife, it is through some herculean schedule arranging,

15:37.360 --> 15:44.720
like, Jedi mind shit where I've, like, tricked somebody into, like, caring for my child and I've

15:44.720 --> 15:49.600
tricked my wife into thinking that it's okay for her to leave our child. And, like, it has been

15:49.600 --> 15:55.040
quite a day, let me tell you. And if you decide that, like, in this brief 90 minutes that I get

15:55.040 --> 15:59.840
to actually speak with my wife, that you would just like to pull up a chair and regale us...

15:59.840 --> 16:01.040
Do a little dinner theater?

16:01.680 --> 16:06.160
Yeah, do a little fucking masquerade to go along with my breadsticks.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.440
And for the rest of the meal, I shall be Samuel Clivens. Enjoy!

16:09.440 --> 16:17.120
Enjoy doing my one-man show, How's the Zeppeli? I don't think... I don't think if a person puts

16:17.120 --> 16:24.240
themselves out there in the way that this... It sounds like this... This waitress put themselves

16:24.240 --> 16:29.440
out there. I don't think it's cool to, like, take steps to shut that down necessarily,

16:29.440 --> 16:34.480
but I totally understand what you guys are saying. And, like, the happiest moment in anyone's life

16:34.480 --> 16:41.440
is not their, you know, when their wedding or their birth of their first child or

16:42.880 --> 16:46.880
whatever. It's when you see that tray of food coming. Oh, and you count the plates,

16:46.880 --> 16:51.280
and you count the number of people at your table, and you say, these numbers are the same.

16:52.240 --> 16:56.640
The number of plates equals the number of people. I've cracked the code, and here it comes.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.720
I've cracked the Piscetti code, and then the Piscetti gets there, and you eat it all up,

17:00.720 --> 17:01.920
and it makes you so happy.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.440
Yeah, it's good to order things with visual signifiers. Like, if there's a menu item that

17:05.440 --> 17:09.120
has a large flag in it, I'll always get that, because then I know it's covered.

17:10.080 --> 17:16.800
So I understand. I do. I think it's a... Yeah, it's a tricky situation, but I'll never feel it.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.880
The problem is that it's never okay to be like,

17:18.880 --> 17:22.400
and our interaction is done now. Please go away, waitress. Like, I get it.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.160
Yeah, because that's what ding-dong ass people do.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.800
Yeah, but like...

17:28.800 --> 17:32.400
But the Piscetti, no, the point is a great point, Justin.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.800
There's no... You're a food prisoner.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.120
Yeah.

17:35.120 --> 17:40.880
Like, it's not like you can say, listen, this has been so fun, but from now on,

17:40.880 --> 17:45.840
I'm just gonna go get my own refills. Is there a key or something to the soda machine that I need?

17:45.840 --> 17:49.680
Okay, thanks. All right, I'm just gonna do my own thing.

17:49.680 --> 17:54.000
Because like, it would be very nice, actually, now that I say that out loud,

17:54.000 --> 17:59.920
if like both parties had that option. Like, you as a server should be able to say like,

17:59.920 --> 18:06.800
listen, this is the pits. You are just the most disreputable human being.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.560
Here's the key to the soda machine.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.040
Yeah.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.800
Are you good? Cool.

18:10.800 --> 18:16.880
So like a Lyft driver or Uber system where like the waitstaff gets to rate you,

18:16.880 --> 18:20.400
you get to rate the waitstaff, and then the next time you come in, they're like,

18:20.400 --> 18:24.800
no, he's got like four stars. Like, no, I'm not waiting on him.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.560
Like, you can wait on him because you're new.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.280
I like the four star metric that you came up with there,

18:29.280 --> 18:32.320
because a four star metric intimates that like most of the time it's fine,

18:32.320 --> 18:37.280
but there was one or two times where it was not fine. And I want to know that story.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.480
Because it was just not fine enough.

18:40.480 --> 18:40.880
It was super not fine.

18:40.880 --> 18:46.400
That they're down to four out of five, but not so not fine that they're like banned from the restaurant.

18:46.400 --> 18:52.000
It's like 10 fives and then like two ones. And it's like, hey, two ones, come here.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.440
Tell me what the fuck's going on before I sit down in that seat.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.160
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

18:58.160 --> 19:00.720
I just super quick just to actually give me an answer.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.120
There's fucking no solution. That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

19:03.120 --> 19:07.680
The good news is that eventually it's done and you can like go back again

19:07.680 --> 19:10.960
and like hope that that person's not working or go somewhere else.

19:10.960 --> 19:16.160
The good news is you're not trapped there for all eternity and you can eventually like leave.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.520
Okay, I'm gonna come down other side of this.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.440
You have no idea what kind of day that person's had.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.360
Maybe they just need to rap about some stuff.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.200
Yeah, but Griffin, this is a customer interaction.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.000
It's Piscetti time.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.760
The point that it's Piscetti time is not going to go away.

19:27.760 --> 19:32.320
I get your point, but this is not like, oh, they were a little bit short with me.

19:32.320 --> 19:38.240
Like I'm here to eat a meal with the person I'm with, not to act as your therapist for the day.

19:38.240 --> 19:41.520
And I usually come down on that side of like, you don't know their life,

19:41.520 --> 19:45.360
but like your job is to leave them alone and let them enjoy their meal

19:45.360 --> 19:46.880
and come back when they need you.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.200
Like that's the basis of your job.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.680
Not to sit there and be like, and let me tell you a little bit more about me.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.440
Like you're not, you don't need bedside manner as a waiter.

19:57.440 --> 19:58.320
Oh, I totally agree.

19:58.320 --> 19:58.960
I totally agree.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.480
Could just be having kind of a hard day though.

20:01.680 --> 20:04.080
Okay, how about this Yahoo!

20:04.080 --> 20:04.800
That everybody's-

20:04.800 --> 20:07.280
Yeah, this one was sent in by Rebecca Usich.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.320
I'm gonna say Usich.

20:11.040 --> 20:11.680
Thank you, Rebecca.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.160
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.840
Let's call them Carly G.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.080
Cause that's lower on the list.

20:20.080 --> 20:20.880
Thank you Car-

20:20.880 --> 20:22.000
Thank you for your bravery.

20:22.800 --> 20:27.520
Carly G asks, chicken soup for boys?

20:28.720 --> 20:33.840
I was wondering if there were any chicken soup books aimed at boys, 14s.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.040
Oh, I thought you meant like literal soup.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.320
Special, yeah.

20:38.320 --> 20:38.640
Mama's-

20:38.640 --> 20:40.320
It's like a whole joke.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.080
Mama's exquisite soup recipe.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.400
Chicken soup just filled with like Hot Wheels cars.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.120
I had a whole joke that instead of chicken and noodles,

20:47.120 --> 20:48.640
it was chicken and doodles.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.680
All right, all right.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.200
Yeah, I'm gonna take that to Shark Tank

20:51.200 --> 20:53.520
and see if I can get any investors.

20:54.560 --> 20:59.760
For my money, it seems like boys, boy teens.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.360
Boy teens.

21:01.360 --> 21:05.600
Boy teens are why other people need those fucking chicken soup books.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.520
Teen boys create the chicken soup market.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.800
Please help me book, I've dealt with boy teens all fucking day.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.840
The boy teens are like the common cold that has necessitated the soup.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.760
As a publisher or author of the chicken soup books,

21:25.840 --> 21:27.920
which I don't know if those books have authors

21:27.920 --> 21:31.360
or if they just like take a bunch of shit out of Reader's Digest

21:31.360 --> 21:33.600
and then they get somebody to chop and screw it.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.200
I always assumed they were the first tentative experiments of a rogue AI.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.080
Okay, yeah.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.760
I always just assumed they had one

21:39.760 --> 21:44.400
and then they just like control F, search doll, replace pronouns

21:44.400 --> 21:49.360
and just like, well, let's change that to a he and done.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.000
Because you would think my chicken soup for boys would be like,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.880
don't put your fucking finger up there.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.640
Don't scratch and don't tug on that.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.960
Don't fucking, just fucking stop.

22:00.960 --> 22:04.320
But the thing is, that book's too effective.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.200
The whole chicken soup for blank economy

22:07.200 --> 22:08.800
is gonna just collapse around me.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.920
You know, the chicken soup for the boy teen soul

22:11.920 --> 22:14.240
could just be one page with one sentence and it just says,

22:14.240 --> 22:15.200
put it away.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.960
You put it the fuck away, dog.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.360
And that could apply to every situation.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.200
I was a boy teen, put it away.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.560
Just put that away.

22:22.560 --> 22:23.600
Just put it away.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.000
Physically.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Whether that means your attitude or your wiener.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.440
Mentally, spiritually, put that thing away.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.000
I feel like that's such a powerful concept, Travis.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.520
I feel like we could start, we could incorporate that into more of our,

22:35.520 --> 22:36.800
just put it away.

22:36.800 --> 22:37.440
Put it away.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.400
Just don't anymore.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.920
Do you guys want to know a quick, very true thing?

22:42.560 --> 22:46.080
I'm gonna guess just based on sort of your whole role here in the organization

22:46.080 --> 22:48.080
that you have Googled the chicken soup series

22:48.080 --> 22:50.240
and you have an interesting factoid

22:50.240 --> 22:52.400
about maybe the number of books that there are in this series.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.000
No, not about that.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.720
It's about the chicken soup for the soul brand large breed adult dog food.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.040
What?

22:59.920 --> 23:00.720
What?

23:00.720 --> 23:02.960
Because food is more than just nutrition.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.360
It's also about comfort, love, and appreciation.

23:05.360 --> 23:11.040
Here's a fucking dog food with the chicken soup for the soul brand on it.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.200
Chicken soup for the soul brand dog food.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.640
You can't do that.

23:16.640 --> 23:20.560
You can't have two different foodstuffs in the name of a product.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.160
It can't be like, what's up?

23:22.160 --> 23:24.720
This is Hamburger Helper's kid wine.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.040
What?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.640
Yeah, it's wine for kids, but it's made by Hamburger Helper.

23:30.160 --> 23:30.480
What?

23:31.280 --> 23:32.400
They're just-

23:32.400 --> 23:36.720
Somewhere there was a board meeting or some kind of product pitch meeting

23:36.720 --> 23:40.400
where someone went, yeah, sure, sure.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.880
Because I'm like digging deep in Amazon

23:44.880 --> 23:49.200
and there's some really, really good chicken soup for the soul books

23:49.200 --> 23:51.920
that we're very much into.

23:51.920 --> 23:55.040
But the weird thing about the dog food

23:55.040 --> 24:01.360
is that you would think there would be some sort of in between licensing

24:01.360 --> 24:02.720
that got them to that point.

24:02.720 --> 24:07.040
But no, as near as I can figure, they made every book

24:07.040 --> 24:07.760
and they haven't made it.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.360
They're like, anybody come up with any other books?

24:10.080 --> 24:12.080
What about chicken soup with the prisoner soul?

24:12.080 --> 24:13.680
Nope, we did that one already.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.840
What about chicken soup for the soul, a book of miracles?

24:18.560 --> 24:19.520
Nope, it exists.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.560
What about chicken soup with the soul?

24:20.560 --> 24:22.240
I can't believe my dog did that.

24:22.240 --> 24:22.960
Nope, it exists.

24:22.960 --> 24:23.760
Who is that book for?

24:23.760 --> 24:26.960
Okay, have we stopped making these for a specific audience?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.080
They're getting like super duper specific.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.600
What haven't we done, guys?

24:31.600 --> 24:34.640
There's chicken soup for Travis Patrick McElroy's soul,

24:34.640 --> 24:36.240
which I don't own.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.040
Maybe, what if we did dog food?

24:42.080 --> 24:44.160
Have we done napkins?

24:45.360 --> 24:48.560
There is a game, there's a chicken soup for the game

24:48.560 --> 24:50.480
and I bet it's fucking fun and shit.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.040
It's not called chicken soup for the game, is it?

24:55.840 --> 24:57.600
No, it's called chicken soup for the soul,

24:57.600 --> 24:59.520
count your blessings, the game.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.120
With an attitude of gratitude.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.120
If it was from the number one best-selling series

25:03.120 --> 25:04.400
as if there was any fucking doubt.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.240
I thought it was chicken soup for the game

25:06.240 --> 25:08.400
all about like how to seduce women.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.840
Okay, part of me is just-

25:11.840 --> 25:14.400
Mystery presents chicken soup for the game.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.320
I'm disappointed to learn

25:16.320 --> 25:17.760
that it's not called chicken soup for the game

25:17.760 --> 25:20.320
because if they started to follow that naming convention,

25:20.320 --> 25:22.960
they could literally sell anything

25:22.960 --> 25:25.760
like chicken soup for the bowling ball.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.880
It's a line of high quality bowling balls.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.160
What's it have to do with chicken soup?

25:30.960 --> 25:31.520
Fuck you.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.520
Is the chicken soup for the soul brand dog food

25:35.520 --> 25:36.960
chicken soup flavored?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
I think it's just the books that nobody buys.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.800
Like, oh, nobody really bought chicken soup

25:42.800 --> 25:44.240
for the boy grandpa.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.040
So let's just chunk those up

25:47.040 --> 25:48.080
and make some puppies eat them.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.880
This is our new product chicken soup for the hamster cage.

25:52.080 --> 25:52.880
Hey guys?

25:52.880 --> 25:53.520
Yeah, Juice?

25:53.520 --> 25:55.360
Can I just shoot a quick review?

25:55.360 --> 25:56.000
Yeah, yeah, hand me-

25:56.000 --> 25:58.080
Chicken soup for the soul board game.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.040
Yeah, I would love to see-

25:59.040 --> 26:00.880
This one comes to us from Seattle Mist.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.960
We thought this game sounded like good wholesome fun,

26:04.960 --> 26:07.440
but it constantly references pop culture,

26:07.440 --> 26:08.560
which is annoying.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.560
There are lots of people who pay little

26:10.560 --> 26:12.560
or no attention to that kind of thing.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.600
So unless you're really hip, in quotes,

26:15.600 --> 26:18.560
on all the current fads, celebrities, and lifestyles,

26:18.560 --> 26:20.320
you want to pass on this game.

26:20.320 --> 26:23.120
We've tweaked the questions before to suit our family,

26:23.120 --> 26:24.640
but it took a lot of tweaking

26:24.640 --> 26:26.400
and now it sits on the shelf.

26:26.400 --> 26:30.000
Okay, hey, who wants to come over

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
and play grandmom and peep pops fucking bootleg chicken soup

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
for the soul 2 rowdy XXX edition

26:40.000 --> 26:43.040
with no references to pop culture?

26:43.040 --> 26:44.400
What's grandma's favorite book?

26:45.760 --> 26:46.640
The notebook?

26:46.640 --> 26:48.240
No, no pop culture.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.120
It's the Bible.

26:51.200 --> 26:51.700
Idiot.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.640
It's the idea of, they're talking about,

26:54.640 --> 26:56.640
it's a shame because it could be a great game.

26:56.640 --> 27:00.240
The idea of looking on the bright side of things is great.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.760
That's why we bought the game.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.000
One of our sons tends to be an Eeyore.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.600
Well, yeah, he's got parents making bootleg chicken soup

27:07.600 --> 27:08.800
for the soul 4 games.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.200
I'd say he has reason to be depressed.

27:11.200 --> 27:15.840
Dear parents, might I watch anything, even PBS?

27:15.840 --> 27:18.400
I'll take 321 contacted this way.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.480
No, we're going to play chicken soup

27:20.480 --> 27:22.720
for the soul our edition again.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.560
But there's only three questions.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.800
And all of them are, why are you sad?

27:26.800 --> 27:29.760
Listen, we tried to play that chicken soup

27:29.760 --> 27:31.520
for the soul board game.

27:31.520 --> 27:34.880
It was so worldly and very secular.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.040
It was a very secular worldly game

27:37.760 --> 27:40.160
and we had to make our own bootleg version of it.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.120
We're proud to present a new line of products

27:45.120 --> 27:48.160
called potato soup for your spirit.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.920
It's a whole new thing, different from that other,

27:51.920 --> 27:55.920
let's call it what it is, shit.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.360
What are you, firefighter?

27:57.360 --> 27:59.200
Don't read that chicken soup book.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.080
It's full of shit.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.920
Potato soup for spirits, what the doctor calls for.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.760
We don't reference anything in potato soup for the spirit,

28:09.280 --> 28:12.880
except potato soup, which is referenced quite a bit.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.200
They made dog food before chicken soup.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.080
Yeah, well, what are they fucking gonna call it?

28:20.080 --> 28:22.560
Justin, chicken soup for the chicken soup for the soul?

28:22.560 --> 28:23.840
Chicken soup for the tummy.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.120
Well, what if the chicken, okay, I gotta say.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.840
What if the chicken soup for the tummy's soul?

28:31.840 --> 28:34.160
Like what, does my tummy have a soul?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.400
If you've been making a line of books and products

28:36.400 --> 28:39.680
and dog food and bowling balls for like 200 years

28:39.680 --> 28:42.320
called chicken soup for the boy grandpa

28:42.320 --> 28:43.840
and then you release chicken soup

28:43.840 --> 28:46.560
and it's not the best fucking chicken soup

28:46.560 --> 28:48.880
that's ever slipped betwixt these lips.

28:48.880 --> 28:52.560
Like, I think it probably discredits the rest of your,

28:52.560 --> 28:54.400
like, I eat that soup and it's just okay

28:54.400 --> 28:56.960
and I think like, well, maybe I don't need to know

28:56.960 --> 28:58.880
what this book says about my firefighter soul.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.000
It turns out they don't know shit about chicken soup.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.200
Yeah, they don't have any idea.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.480
They don't know what's fucking good for me.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.520
It's all carrots, what?

29:08.480 --> 29:09.920
This is just a can of carrots.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.600
Do you think, is there a law preventing me

29:13.600 --> 29:17.200
from reading chicken soup for the firefighter soul

29:17.200 --> 29:19.840
or chicken soup for the grandma's soul?

29:19.840 --> 29:22.000
Groups that I will never, I'm more likely

29:22.000 --> 29:23.760
to become a grandma than a firefighter

29:23.760 --> 29:27.840
but like, am I allowed to read the books not designed for me

29:27.840 --> 29:31.120
or is there some sort of security like eye scanner or RFID?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.800
You're allowed to read it

29:32.800 --> 29:35.600
but they're just full of so much slang and jargon.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.640
Like they've got, firefighters have like 18 different word

29:38.640 --> 29:41.200
for like the embers that land on your nose.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.720
But no word for snow.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.200
But no word for snow, kind of weird.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.280
Think about it.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.600
And the grandma one is just like a lot

29:49.600 --> 29:53.360
of like long since retired racist words

29:53.360 --> 29:57.280
for really, well, any race, the whole rainbow of races.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.360
The whole spectrum.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.760
My dad just got the iPhone six plus, a large phone

30:03.760 --> 30:06.320
and has been calling it his cocaine tray

30:06.960 --> 30:09.200
in public and in private.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.120
When I bring it up, he smiles and says,

30:11.120 --> 30:12.640
oh, am I embarrassing you?

30:12.640 --> 30:15.520
What do?

30:15.520 --> 30:17.840
That's from Cocaine Confusing California.

30:17.840 --> 30:18.560
God, that's so good.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.360
That's really good, dude.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.720
Your dad is awesome.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.040
Yeah.

30:21.040 --> 30:21.920
It's so good.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.160
Have you considered starting a Dungeons

30:24.160 --> 30:25.520
and Dragons podcast with him?

30:26.320 --> 30:27.520
That's so good.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.240
Am I embarrassing you?

30:30.240 --> 30:32.880
I mean, confusing more than anything, dad

30:32.880 --> 30:35.280
but chase your bliss, go for it.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.120
It's a solid joke, milk it.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.880
When he says, here's the way to get him to stop.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.040
Next time he calls this cocaine tray, just nod

30:43.040 --> 30:43.920
and be like, nice.

30:43.920 --> 30:44.480
Nice, dude.

30:45.120 --> 30:45.600
Nice, dude.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.560
And then you take out your phone,

30:49.360 --> 30:50.800
do a line of blow off of it.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.400
While making intense eye contact with him.

30:54.400 --> 30:54.720
Yeah.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.480
And you say, you want to bump old man?

30:58.880 --> 31:00.080
We'll go line for line.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.160
Is that a thing people do?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.360
Like you go shot for shot.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.960
Is that a thing people do with Coke?

31:04.960 --> 31:06.160
Only I've got to challenge each other

31:06.160 --> 31:07.600
to like Coke races.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.760
Yeah, it's like Lady and the Tramp

31:09.760 --> 31:11.680
where they start on opposite ends of a line

31:11.680 --> 31:13.360
and then they come together and they're nose kissing.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.360
Don't nose kiss your dad.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.120
Let's go to the buddy zone.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.840
Justin, can I ask you a question?

31:29.840 --> 31:30.320
Yeah.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.200
How are you sleeping?

31:33.200 --> 31:34.560
Not actually.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.680
Cool, cool.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.320
Thanks baby.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.920
My wife, as you know, and maybe the internet doesn't know,

31:39.920 --> 31:43.600
but is pregnant and so she has not been sleeping.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.680
Congratulations.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.680
Oh, I forgot to tell you guys, sorry.

31:47.680 --> 31:51.040
But so she's been sleeping infrequently

31:51.040 --> 31:53.280
as pregnant ladies are like to do.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.240
And I can tell you something,

31:54.240 --> 31:55.680
we've got that Casper mattress

31:55.680 --> 31:58.160
and I am not disturbed when she gets up

31:58.160 --> 31:59.520
and isn't able to sleep immediately.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.000
Okay, so then you just went a different direction.

32:02.000 --> 32:02.640
What?

32:02.640 --> 32:03.600
I thought you were maybe gonna say

32:03.600 --> 32:05.040
like the Casper mattress is so great

32:05.040 --> 32:10.880
that it can lull my otherwise bothered pregnant wife

32:10.880 --> 32:13.440
directly to slumber town.

32:13.440 --> 32:14.960
I really haven't asked her about it,

32:14.960 --> 32:17.600
but like I've been continuing to sleep great.

32:17.600 --> 32:18.400
Oh like, yeah.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.080
Straight through the night.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.680
No amount of her tossing and turning

32:23.680 --> 32:25.680
and wailing and gnashing of teeth

32:25.680 --> 32:28.640
can disturb my slumber on a Casper mattress.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.440
Casper mattress is incredible.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.040
They send it straight to your door

32:33.040 --> 32:37.120
and they, through whatever black magic they've done,

32:37.120 --> 32:39.280
they're able to keep costs down

32:39.280 --> 32:42.640
to the point where it almost seems unbelievable.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.880
You can get a twin size mattress for as low as $500,

32:46.880 --> 32:48.960
a king size mattress for only $950,

32:48.960 --> 32:51.200
which is an amazing, amazing deal.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.560
The mattresses are incredible.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.760
They're incredibly comfortable.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.120
I mean, since we got ours,

32:55.120 --> 32:57.040
we've been sleeping better than ever before.

32:58.080 --> 33:01.680
And it has a risk-free trial and return policy,

33:01.680 --> 33:04.480
which means you can sleep on it for a hundred days.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.880
And if you don't like it, you just return it.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.360
And they're made in America,

33:09.360 --> 33:12.240
which if you only want to sleep on American things,

33:13.040 --> 33:13.840
you've done it.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.720
What's the special offer you ask?

33:16.720 --> 33:17.920
That's a good question.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.600
Justin, what is the special offer?

33:19.600 --> 33:21.040
What's the special offer, Trav?

33:21.040 --> 33:21.920
Let me tell you.

33:21.920 --> 33:22.720
Oh, okay.

33:22.720 --> 33:25.040
I thought you were asking me, but I just asked you.

33:25.040 --> 33:25.360
Yeah, I know.

33:25.360 --> 33:25.920
I'm with you.

33:25.920 --> 33:26.240
Okay.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.720
NBA listeners can get $50 towards any mattress purchase

33:28.720 --> 33:30.720
if they go to Casper.com slash my brother.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.600
And use promo code mybrother on one word

33:33.600 --> 33:35.120
at checkout terms and conditions apply.

33:35.840 --> 33:36.240
Go do that.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.800
That's Casper.com slash my brother,

33:38.800 --> 33:41.280
and then use promo code mybrother at checkout.

33:41.280 --> 33:41.920
You gotta do them both.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.240
Can I talk to you guys about Harry's?

33:45.760 --> 33:46.800
Yeah, you don't need to.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.480
I'm like a big fan, but go ahead.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.480
I've never shaved before in my life, but-

33:50.480 --> 33:50.800
Clearly.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.400
So please, please tell me something.

33:52.960 --> 33:53.680
Anything.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.440
Free me from this beard prison.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.560
You haven't heard of Harry's.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.640
That's because you are a Harry,

33:58.640 --> 34:00.640
like from Harry in the Hinder sentences.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.280
Guys, they should call it not Harry's.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.000
Holy shit, Travis.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.600
It's so fucking good, dude.

34:07.600 --> 34:08.240
Thank you.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.760
I just shit my pants.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.040
Thank you.

34:11.600 --> 34:12.960
Shit your pants good.

34:12.960 --> 34:13.920
That's a shit.

34:13.920 --> 34:14.720
That's a shit.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.280
That's a shit my pants good joke.

34:17.280 --> 34:17.840
Thank you.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.200
Thank you.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.720
Put it up on the board.

34:20.720 --> 34:21.360
Thanks, guys.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.240
So what is it?

34:25.520 --> 34:26.400
It's a place where you-

34:26.400 --> 34:28.800
I was gonna talk about it, but this is all fine.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.080
This ad is going great.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.840
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.680
It's the shaving thing.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.040
We're supported in part this week by harrys.com.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.720
You gotta ask yourself, hey, why are razors,

34:40.720 --> 34:43.680
why do they cost $140 per razor?

34:43.680 --> 34:46.240
And they're locked inside of like

34:46.240 --> 34:49.040
Magneto's fucking mind prison.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.400
And why are they so sharp?

34:50.400 --> 34:52.320
And why are they so fucking sharp?

34:53.840 --> 34:55.840
No, razors that you buy in the store are a piece of shit.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.400
They're so overpriced that people are more likely to steal them.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.240
If you make a razor cost as much as a television,

35:00.240 --> 35:01.440
yeah, people are gonna steal those shits

35:01.440 --> 35:02.720
because it's way smaller than a television.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.000
Crime of the century, easy crime.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.600
It's like, it's the copper wire of hygiene products.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.760
Harry's fixes all of that.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.680
They're good quality, German engineered,

35:11.680 --> 35:12.960
five blade cartridges.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.960
Get a close, comfy shave, quality guaranteed.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.720
You get a full refund if you're not happy with the shave.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.560
And then the price, it's factory direct.

35:18.560 --> 35:22.000
You cut out, you say, get the fuck out of here, Walgreens.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.560
You say, get the fuck out of here, Dwayne Reddy.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.800
Is it Reddy or Reed?

35:26.800 --> 35:29.040
No one's quite sure who that is named after.

35:29.040 --> 35:32.320
But anyway, you say, get the fuck out of here, Dwayne whoever.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.280
Because these razors-

35:33.280 --> 35:34.320
Dwayne the Rock Johnson?

35:34.960 --> 35:36.960
Well, no, I would never say that to him.

35:37.680 --> 35:42.560
These razors from here, if they get in here, Dwayne and shave me.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.560
I want a full body shave from Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.680
Not asking too much.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.200
I don't think that's asking too much at all.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.760
So they sell their blades at half the price of the leading brand.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.920
They have a Truman starter set.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.200
It's a great option for new customers.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.880
It's an amazing deal for just 15 bucks.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.880
You get a razor handle, moisturizing shave cream,

36:00.880 --> 36:04.400
and three of Harry's five blade German engineered razors.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.200
Harry's will give you five bucks off.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.640
Just because you're a listener of our show,

36:08.640 --> 36:10.880
if you go to harrys.com and use the promo code,

36:10.880 --> 36:12.160
MYBROTHER, all one word.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.840
That's H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.360
And use the promo code, MYBROTHER.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.120
Get that cool, cool set for five bucks off.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.760
I've got a message for Steve Prittis.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.280
It's from Beth, AKA Amp.

36:25.920 --> 36:26.640
Awesome.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.600
Amp.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.640
Happy birthday to the only one who managed to melt

36:30.640 --> 36:33.600
this once icy heart with cuddles and kisses

36:33.600 --> 36:35.520
and the occasional cup of tea.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.160
Love you always, Steve, my perfect boyfriend,

36:38.160 --> 36:41.040
partner, and future husband, heart, sign.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.880
From your cheesy girlfriend slash wife, Beth.

36:44.880 --> 36:47.840
It's like a time traveling message in there, isn't it?

36:47.840 --> 36:49.280
What are you talking about?

36:49.280 --> 36:52.320
Well, because she says that Steve is her boyfriend,

36:52.320 --> 36:55.360
and then she identifies herself as both girlfriend and wife,

36:55.360 --> 36:57.360
as though she has become unstuck in time

36:57.360 --> 36:59.520
and exists in both the present and the future

36:59.520 --> 37:00.560
when they are married.

37:00.560 --> 37:05.120
The time traveler's wife.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.840
Maybe this is when they first meet.

37:07.840 --> 37:10.640
This is the first time Steve has heard of Beth.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.320
Oh, fuck yeah, the lake house.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.040
Maybe this is when they move in together.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.720
This is when they move into the lake house.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.320
This is when they move into the lake house,

37:20.320 --> 37:22.160
and they're like, I'm gonna go check out the bathroom.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.800
Whoa, I'm in caveman times.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.880
Get me the fuck out of here, Sandra Bullock.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.160
I'm trying, but I just can't get Ziggy to answer me.

37:32.160 --> 37:32.960
Happy birthday, Steve.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.200
I'm not talking about fucking quantum leap again.

37:35.200 --> 37:39.280
I got a message for Avital from Rishi,

37:39.280 --> 37:42.880
and it says, the Tron won't accommodate my entire LJ entry,

37:42.880 --> 37:45.520
wrote, so I quote, I saw him on stage

37:45.520 --> 37:46.800
and he was singing out to heaven.

37:46.800 --> 37:50.640
I swear, arms outstretched, so out piece of themself,

37:50.640 --> 37:52.800
just so free, I started crying.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.280
You, Avital Isaacs, wrote that

37:55.280 --> 37:57.520
about Chris Martin at your Coldplay concert.

38:01.360 --> 38:04.240
I'm laughing already, and it was all yellow, you lunatic.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.280
That's amazing.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.520
Oh, fuck me.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.360
This is all time.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.720
This is all time.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.320
Do you guys want to read it?

38:16.320 --> 38:18.000
I feel bad that I got to read it.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.120
This is so fucking savage.

38:19.120 --> 38:22.160
Okay, wait, we each get to do, hold on, line readings.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.680
Okay, go ahead.

38:23.680 --> 38:24.560
Go ahead, Travis.

38:24.560 --> 38:29.040
I saw him on stage and he was singing out to heaven.

38:29.600 --> 38:35.760
I swear, arms outstretched, so at peace with himself,

38:35.760 --> 38:49.200
just so free, I started crying.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.400
This is the meanest thing anybody's ever done on this show.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.440
It's like the meanest thing that anybody's ever done,

38:55.440 --> 38:58.560
but it's like, it's bulletproof.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.800
It's so fucking good.

39:00.800 --> 39:01.600
It's Teflon.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.520
Like, you can't, what are you going to do?

39:03.520 --> 39:05.520
Say you didn't write that on the live journal, you did.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.520
You did put it on the live journal.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.320
It's right there.

39:09.120 --> 39:13.920
By the way, I'm sorry to hear that our Jumbotron 3000

39:13.920 --> 39:20.240
cannot accept your full LJ entry, mbnbam at maximumfun.org

39:20.240 --> 39:22.640
or Justin at teengoogle.com

39:22.640 --> 39:25.760
if you want to just shoot that over my way

39:25.760 --> 39:35.360
and I can enjoy it in its entirety.

39:35.360 --> 39:38.240
Hi, are you a fan of Star Trek The Next Generation?

39:38.800 --> 39:41.360
Well, that's weird because it's a corny show,

39:41.360 --> 39:43.680
but my friends Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica

39:43.680 --> 39:45.760
do a lovely podcast about it.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.360
It's called The Greatest Generation

39:47.360 --> 39:49.440
and it's on maximumfun.org.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.560
I thought that this podcast was a bad idea,

39:52.560 --> 39:53.920
but I was wrong.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.240
Please listen to The Greatest Generation

39:56.240 --> 39:58.160
on maximumfun.org.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.080
Um, do you guys want to Yahoo?

40:02.720 --> 40:05.520
No, because it's time for the hottest new feature

40:05.520 --> 40:07.920
that is on my brother, my brother and me

40:07.920 --> 40:10.400
and it's called Munch Squad.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.520
I want to rock!

40:12.960 --> 40:17.520
Fear has gripped my heart with its long icy hand.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.920
You know how, okay, so Munch Squad is a new feature

40:21.920 --> 40:24.720
on my brother, my brother and me hosted by Justin Marker.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.760
You know how like you're always hearing

40:27.760 --> 40:31.360
about great new fast food items.

40:31.360 --> 40:31.920
Oh, fuck.

40:33.120 --> 40:36.400
But you find out about them from somebody else, right?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.880
Well, no longer because on my brother, my brother and me,

40:38.880 --> 40:41.040
I'm going to be bringing you the latest

40:41.040 --> 40:42.480
and greatest from fast food

40:42.480 --> 40:45.680
and it's going to be direct from the people making them.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.880
I'm not interested in what some YouTube commoner thinks

40:48.880 --> 40:50.480
of the hottest fast food items.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.160
I want to take it straight from the professionals

40:52.160 --> 40:53.360
who are paid to know about this stuff.

40:53.360 --> 40:53.840
Okay.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.160
So I'm going to be bringing you the dirt,

40:56.160 --> 40:57.840
the scoop, direct scoop

40:57.840 --> 41:00.080
and probably there will be scoops of dirt

41:00.080 --> 41:02.160
at least a few of these items, I would imagine.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.000
I just want to get ahead of this

41:04.000 --> 41:05.760
and I want to say you didn't tell us

41:05.760 --> 41:06.560
about this ahead of time.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.160
Correct.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.880
Any crunching or munching you do into your microphone.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.680
I'm not eating it.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.440
This is literally just PR.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.840
That's all I'm bringing you is the direct feed

41:15.840 --> 41:17.360
from the companies making the product.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.280
Oh my God, so you're not even eating the food.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.400
I'm not going to get my fucking bite.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.600
I'm not an expert like these people.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.360
I'm not paid to know what's good

41:25.360 --> 41:26.720
and what's bad in the world of fast food.

41:26.720 --> 41:27.920
So during this segment,

41:27.920 --> 41:31.520
you're just going to read PR bursts.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.200
I'm going to read it with my own sort of like twisted spin,

41:35.200 --> 41:36.960
which means yes, I'm just going to read it

41:36.960 --> 41:38.640
with no editorialization whatsoever.

41:38.640 --> 41:38.960
All right.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.680
This first item, you're going to...

41:42.800 --> 41:43.760
This has been sort of like...

41:43.760 --> 41:46.000
Can we guess who the company is?

41:46.800 --> 41:48.320
I imagine it will be pretty evident

41:48.320 --> 41:49.360
if they talk about like...

41:50.000 --> 41:51.520
Yeah, you will know this one.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.040
I'm still going to guess, go for it.

41:53.040 --> 41:53.440
Okay.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.720
This is just a game for me.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.720
If it says like so much cheese, you'll come.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.920
It's like, oh, TGI Fridays.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.640
The first one up is called the Naked Crispy Chicken Taco.

42:04.640 --> 42:04.880
Okay.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.080
It started getting tested in September.

42:12.080 --> 42:15.360
Some people started showing up there.

42:15.360 --> 42:18.480
BuzzFeed says that this is a Tex-Mex chain,

42:18.480 --> 42:21.440
which is literally the height of generosity.

42:21.440 --> 42:21.920
Yeah.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.440
I mean, it's talk about.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.120
This is a food business.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.280
It's a food business.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.640
It's a food repository.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.520
This is a Tex-Mex adjacent restaurant.

42:32.560 --> 42:36.000
So what's the Naked Crispy Chicken Taco?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.560
Well, it's like a taco.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.920
Hey, can I say something?

42:39.920 --> 42:41.280
Bad fucking start.

42:41.280 --> 42:42.640
Bad fucking start, but...

42:42.640 --> 42:44.960
You know what, taco is a fucking thing.

42:44.960 --> 42:45.600
What taco?

42:46.160 --> 42:46.560
Okay.

42:46.560 --> 42:49.360
Hold that image in your mind, but get ready to spin it.

42:49.360 --> 42:52.640
It's like a taco, except instead of a crispy corn shell,

42:53.200 --> 42:56.800
they have a very thin filet of fried chicken.

42:56.800 --> 42:57.280
No.

42:57.280 --> 43:00.480
And that is making up the shell of the...

43:01.680 --> 43:02.000
Yeah.

43:02.800 --> 43:06.960
That is the item which we were talking about today.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.320
Just for you guys, if you're at home,

43:08.320 --> 43:09.760
you can feel free to Google this,

43:09.760 --> 43:12.240
but I went ahead and just dropped you guys

43:12.240 --> 43:14.080
in a little image there in your Skype window.

43:14.080 --> 43:14.960
You can check that out.

43:15.520 --> 43:18.320
It is a very thin filet of fried chicken.

43:19.040 --> 43:24.320
I hate every pixel of this fucking image you just sent me.

43:24.320 --> 43:26.640
So let's hear about it from the experts, okay?

43:27.680 --> 43:29.440
You don't want to hear about it from me, okay?

43:29.440 --> 43:30.240
And they're just...

43:30.240 --> 43:31.120
When is this going to happen?

43:31.680 --> 43:34.400
Kat Garcia Taco Bell's senior manager of marketing says,

43:34.400 --> 43:36.240
we're just planning what's the right...

43:36.240 --> 43:37.280
We're just playing around.

43:40.480 --> 43:41.360
We're just having fun.

43:41.360 --> 43:42.640
We're just playing around, man.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.960
Even we don't know when this is going to come out.

43:44.960 --> 43:45.200
Yeah.

43:46.240 --> 43:49.440
It got its start when Taco Bell's senior director of innovation,

43:50.480 --> 43:53.840
you'll remember, fired for that position in disgrace in 2012.

43:54.720 --> 43:58.560
Heather Mothershaw, who imagined a taco shell made from chicken Milanese.

43:58.560 --> 44:01.760
One night when she was super duper, duper, duper high and drunk.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.240
Simultaneously.

44:05.360 --> 44:10.880
So this is a quote from chief marketing officer Marissa Thalberg.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.240
I'm so, so sorry.

44:12.240 --> 44:13.600
Please, God, forgive me.

44:14.240 --> 44:16.880
Think of all the crazy firsts that have existed in time and civilization.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.200
Dare we say-

44:19.200 --> 44:22.480
Light bulb, flight, chicken taco.

44:22.480 --> 44:25.040
Dare we say even the creation of the wheel probably-

44:25.040 --> 44:25.360
No!

44:25.360 --> 44:26.480
Go fucking home.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.040
Go home.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.640
Well, they did make the wheel out of a thin filet of fried chicken.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.680
That's a really good thing.

44:32.640 --> 44:35.680
So this has become a passion project of Steve Gomez,

44:35.680 --> 44:37.760
Taco Bell's manager of product development.

44:38.880 --> 44:41.040
He literally says it's a passion project, which like...

44:41.040 --> 44:44.080
You think that's code for fetish?

44:44.080 --> 44:46.000
Hey buddy, your passion fucking sucks.

44:47.200 --> 44:53.840
Garcia said he was worried that consumers might think it's weird,

44:53.840 --> 44:57.440
fair food or it's jester-y is his word.

44:57.440 --> 45:00.560
I'm worried that the consumers might have the final thought

45:00.560 --> 45:05.040
on this mortal coil of this is like fair food before they promptly die.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.400
And he said, when you explain to someone,

45:08.400 --> 45:09.920
they create a visualization in their mind.

45:09.920 --> 45:13.200
But then you put it in front of them and you're like, try it.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.880
And then it's like, okay, I get it.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.720
I'm looking at a fucking Business Insider article about this taco.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.000
And I think the way that Business Insider got tipped off

45:22.000 --> 45:25.120
is this tweet from Twitter user Jock, J-A-W-K.

45:25.840 --> 45:30.160
And it's a picture image of this fucking accident.

45:31.440 --> 45:32.320
And the tweet says,

45:32.320 --> 45:36.240
Yo Taco Bell, I found a location that had a taco shell made out of chicken.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.120
It was so good.

45:37.120 --> 45:38.320
Any more info on this?

45:38.320 --> 45:42.480
So just to like walk through this person's day, they went to Taco Bell

45:42.480 --> 45:44.480
and they're like, hey, welcome to Taco Bell.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.200
What would you like?

45:45.200 --> 45:47.440
Oh, by the way, I don't know if you're interested,

45:47.440 --> 45:50.800
but we do have this essentially forbidden menu item.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.440
You've never, I guarantee you've never had it before.

45:53.440 --> 45:55.120
It's just like, we're having some fun with,

45:55.120 --> 45:58.080
I imagine like the opening scene in Gremlins where it's like,

45:58.080 --> 46:01.360
I don't really feel like a quesalupa or a taco or a burrito today.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.560
Like, well, that's all we have.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.880
Unless you want to try this like crazy shit,

46:05.600 --> 46:07.920
unless you want to try this crazy garbage that'll death you.

46:07.920 --> 46:09.200
That'll definitely kill your heart.

46:11.120 --> 46:13.360
I like that he's asking for more info.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.920
What fucking context do you need, my dude?

46:15.920 --> 46:17.120
It's a fucking fried chicken taco.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.960
My tweet to Taco Bell would have been like,

46:18.960 --> 46:21.520
of course I ordered, like, of course I ordered this

46:21.520 --> 46:22.880
because I'm like the beginning of Gremlins,

46:22.880 --> 46:24.320
like my curiosity was piqued.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.960
And I just want to know, like, here's the store number.

46:26.960 --> 46:29.520
Send all these people to fucking jail.

46:29.520 --> 46:30.560
And I just want to know,

46:30.560 --> 46:33.920
will you be responsible for taking care of my family when I'm dead?

46:33.920 --> 46:34.320
Yeah.

46:34.320 --> 46:37.200
Certainly this franchise has gone rogue.

46:37.200 --> 46:37.440
Yeah.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.600
This is a rogue Taco Bell that must be put down.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.400
At Taco Bell, they must be stopped at all costs.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.040
Just want you to know, your employees have done this.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.880
There's no punishment harsh enough,

46:46.880 --> 46:48.640
so I really need you to think outside the bun.

46:49.280 --> 46:52.720
Time to call in your treaties with the Burger King and put a stop to this.

46:53.920 --> 46:58.800
I want to read you guys the fucking quote of the thing, the whole thing.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.560
And this is from Garcia again.

47:00.560 --> 47:01.440
We're back to Garcia.

47:02.160 --> 47:03.360
I just love it so much.

47:03.360 --> 47:09.120
Taco Bell has found in the test that the vegetables somehow managed to give the meaty,

47:09.920 --> 47:14.560
deep fried chalupa a, quote, health halo in the eyes of consumers.

47:14.560 --> 47:18.000
Quote, we were getting feedback like it's so healthy.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.160
It's so fresh, said Garcia.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.040
That really surprised us because it's fried chicken.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.560
That's his quote.

47:24.560 --> 47:25.840
That's Garcia's quote.

47:25.840 --> 47:28.960
That really surprised us because it's fried chicken.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.200
Do you think that it really surprised us

47:31.200 --> 47:33.520
is not like how healthy people thought it were,

47:33.520 --> 47:37.120
but like how easy everyone was to fool into eating?

47:37.120 --> 47:41.200
Yeah, like every fucking time we think that we've crossed the Rubicon,

47:41.200 --> 47:44.000
America's like, hey, there's another Rubicon up ahead.

47:44.000 --> 47:44.720
Let's keep going.

47:44.720 --> 47:49.760
When we debuted the chicken bad taco at some slug stores,

47:49.760 --> 47:52.640
we expected to be run out of town on a rail.

47:52.640 --> 47:55.760
But here we are, the mayors of Flavortown.

47:55.760 --> 47:57.760
We don't know what's going on.

47:57.760 --> 47:58.960
We were really surprised.

47:58.960 --> 48:03.840
I would be surprised if the people who ate this experiment

48:03.840 --> 48:05.200
knew there were vegetables in it.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.520
Because I feel like it's a very human response,

48:07.520 --> 48:10.720
certainly an American response to when I see fried chicken,

48:10.720 --> 48:15.920
I have this like almost predatory like response of just like,

48:15.920 --> 48:19.200
I need to put that in my throat like as fast as I possibly can.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.440
And if there are vegetables in the way of that goal,

48:21.440 --> 48:22.880
I will, of course, eat them.

48:22.880 --> 48:25.600
But it's just like the path there.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.560
It means to an end.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.240
I would eat this.

48:28.880 --> 48:32.960
So that's your much squatter for today.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.160
I will consume this thing.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.080
Well, of course, we're going to.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.120
That's the thing, right?

48:37.120 --> 48:37.600
Okay.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.600
They said that every, Gomez says,

48:39.600 --> 48:42.000
every year the benchmark gets higher and higher

48:42.000 --> 48:46.400
for new big taco innovation ideas, says Gomez.

48:46.400 --> 48:48.560
Is big taco capitalized?

48:48.560 --> 48:50.320
I want to know who's fucking problem

48:50.320 --> 48:53.280
that particular arms race is, Taco Bell.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.120
Like that's your, that's on you.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.880
You're in a race with yourself.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.280
Yeah, we got Taco Cabana down here,

48:59.280 --> 49:02.480
but they don't like, they would have to just be like,

49:02.480 --> 49:03.440
it's a gun.

49:03.440 --> 49:07.520
It's a fucking gun that shoots a taco into your tummy.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.360
Del Taco, which is just one step away

49:09.360 --> 49:12.720
from just calling themselves Bell Taco is like,

49:12.720 --> 49:15.840
they're just happy to be considered

49:15.840 --> 49:20.800
in the same like taco store discussion as the Taco Bell.

49:20.800 --> 49:23.040
I don't know that anyone else is like,

49:23.040 --> 49:24.880
we made a taco out of chocolate.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.200
Like nobody's doing that.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.640
Sorry, are you talking about a Choco Taco?

49:29.280 --> 49:31.760
Well, I said it and then I immediately regretted it

49:31.760 --> 49:33.440
because I knew a Choco Taco was a thing.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.440
Let's see, we put taco meat inside

49:35.440 --> 49:37.040
of a live alligator's mouth.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.960
And now you consume the whole thing in one bite.

49:39.680 --> 49:41.760
You fucking French the gator.

49:41.760 --> 49:44.480
French this meat out of this alligator's mouth.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.840
We call it a Croco Taco.

49:45.840 --> 49:48.960
We call it a Bayou Blaster.

49:51.600 --> 49:52.880
I want to hear you another Yahoo.

49:52.880 --> 49:55.280
Okay, I got this one and it's from Morgan Davey.

49:55.280 --> 49:55.840
Thank you, Morgan.

49:56.880 --> 49:59.680
It's from Yahoo Answers user Bill who asks,

49:59.680 --> 50:02.400
Bill launched his account on April 30th, 2016.

50:03.440 --> 50:06.560
Just fucking wanted to get in before Yahoo goes away forever.

50:06.560 --> 50:08.400
Did you guys see somebody in the Facebook group

50:08.400 --> 50:11.360
or somebody emailed us that like got some scuttlebutt

50:11.360 --> 50:13.920
from people like on Yahoo who were just like,

50:13.920 --> 50:16.240
oh yeah, Yahoo Answers like we will get rid

50:16.240 --> 50:17.680
of that shit as quick as we possibly can.

50:18.560 --> 50:19.200
Oh really?

50:19.200 --> 50:21.120
I'm saying it's not looking good.

50:21.120 --> 50:27.920
Anyway, Bill asks, does space weed exist

50:27.920 --> 50:29.680
in the Star Wars canon?

50:29.680 --> 50:30.160
Fuck yeah.

50:30.160 --> 50:30.960
Oh God.

50:31.920 --> 50:32.800
Good question.

50:34.320 --> 50:35.200
I want to hear about that.

50:36.480 --> 50:37.440
Space Dojo.

50:37.440 --> 50:42.080
The person most likely to really just like get bait.

50:42.080 --> 50:42.320
Yeah.

50:42.320 --> 50:42.960
Yoda, right?

50:42.960 --> 50:45.600
Dude, Dago Bong.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.240
Dago Bong is very good.

50:50.240 --> 50:50.880
Good.

50:50.880 --> 50:52.800
That's why Darth Vader sounded like that.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.320
He's just hot boxing that mask.

50:54.320 --> 50:55.520
Darth Vapor.

50:56.480 --> 50:57.600
Darth Vapor.

51:00.160 --> 51:03.200
Smoke instead of Snoke.

51:03.760 --> 51:04.320
Oh, okay.

51:04.320 --> 51:04.560
Okay.

51:04.560 --> 51:05.680
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.

51:05.680 --> 51:06.320
All right.

51:06.320 --> 51:06.880
Yo Dank?

51:07.840 --> 51:09.600
Well, I feel like we already did Yoda.

51:10.960 --> 51:11.360
Do you?

51:12.400 --> 51:13.200
Chewbonga.

51:13.920 --> 51:14.800
Chewbonga?

51:14.800 --> 51:15.760
Oh yeah.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.160
Bong Solo?

51:18.160 --> 51:20.320
Is that two?

51:20.320 --> 51:22.400
I feel like maybe we should do less of the Bong

51:22.400 --> 51:23.920
and maybe we should start telling jokes.

51:25.360 --> 51:25.600
Yeah.

51:25.600 --> 51:28.240
A joke would be good.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.920
By the way, if my fucking-

51:29.920 --> 51:31.280
This is me for the rest of the show.

51:31.280 --> 51:31.760
Go on.

51:31.760 --> 51:35.520
If my Twitter replies turn into a fucking Star Wars weed wasteland,

51:35.520 --> 51:37.680
I swear to God I'll do the whole service.

51:37.680 --> 51:38.720
I would delete my account.

51:38.720 --> 51:41.200
You'll come up and you'll find an egg in my place.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.960
I do not need that in my life right now.

51:42.960 --> 51:46.560
Do you guys think when Lynn wrote the song,

51:46.560 --> 51:48.960
wrote the music for that one scene of Force Awakens,

51:48.960 --> 51:51.360
he had to ask questions about the canon of it

51:51.920 --> 51:53.600
to really nail the song?

51:53.600 --> 51:55.200
And one of those questions had to be like,

51:55.200 --> 51:56.960
all right, we're in a good time party spot.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.760
People are definitely blazing on some space weed, right?

51:59.760 --> 52:00.880
And JJ Abrams was like,

52:02.000 --> 52:02.720
of course.

52:03.760 --> 52:04.400
Yeah, dude.

52:04.400 --> 52:05.680
Of course they are.

52:05.680 --> 52:07.360
You've just blown my mind, Griffin,

52:07.360 --> 52:08.240
because the fact of the matter is,

52:08.240 --> 52:10.880
with how much extended universe there is in this canon,

52:10.880 --> 52:16.320
there's definitely a scene of somebody smoking some kind of space opium.

52:16.320 --> 52:18.480
Well, there's the death sticks, right?

52:18.480 --> 52:19.440
Is that a thing?

52:20.160 --> 52:21.120
I believe you, Griffin.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.720
You could have said literally anything.

52:22.720 --> 52:25.280
Somebody tries to sell one to Obi Kenobi.

52:25.840 --> 52:26.880
That's what I call him.

52:26.880 --> 52:28.640
I just cut the wan out because I'm a busy guy.

52:29.280 --> 52:30.320
What about spice?

52:30.320 --> 52:31.200
Isn't that a thing?

52:31.200 --> 52:32.240
Spice in Star Wars?

52:32.240 --> 52:32.480
Probably.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.360
Guys, you're getting fucking way off track.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.360
Of course there's drugs in the Star Wars universe.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.000
Of course there are.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.080
Han Solo is a fucking smuggler.

52:40.080 --> 52:42.560
Like, why do you think that job exists if he's not, like, peddling?

52:42.560 --> 52:43.360
Smuggler waffles.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.760
And everybody looks at Han Solo and he's like,

52:45.760 --> 52:46.880
oh, what a fun time guy.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.480
And I don't want-

52:48.480 --> 52:49.200
He's a drug runner.

52:49.200 --> 52:49.600
He's fucking-

52:49.600 --> 52:51.840
Yeah, he's like, hey, it's me, Han Solo.

52:52.560 --> 52:53.360
Dashing rogue.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.120
Anyway, here's some crack.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.040
Now, hold on.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.640
He's not the dealer, Griffin.

53:00.640 --> 53:01.280
He's just the-

53:01.280 --> 53:02.480
He's the mule.

53:02.480 --> 53:02.880
Yeah.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.080
Hey, thanks, sir.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.360
Hey, welcome to Kid Planet.

53:05.360 --> 53:05.680
Thanks.

53:05.680 --> 53:07.280
This is my luggage.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.080
All right, come on in.

53:08.080 --> 53:08.400
Thanks.

53:08.400 --> 53:09.760
Step, walk, walk, walk, walk.

53:09.760 --> 53:11.920
Hey, here's that crack for Kid Planet.

53:14.320 --> 53:15.200
Yeah, get that out there.

53:15.200 --> 53:15.840
Get that out there.

53:15.840 --> 53:16.400
Where's my-

53:16.400 --> 53:17.200
Where's my money?

53:20.000 --> 53:23.200
We'll get you the crack as soon as Chewbacca shits it out later.

53:24.640 --> 53:25.920
It's all ballooned up there.

53:25.920 --> 53:26.160
Yeah.

53:26.960 --> 53:29.840
Every time that Han Solo flakes on the rebellion,

53:29.840 --> 53:34.000
you have to remember that he is doing it to go trance for crack.

53:34.000 --> 53:34.720
Yeah, he's dead.

53:35.760 --> 53:38.800
He's back and he saved us as we attacked the Death Star.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.

53:40.880 --> 53:41.680
Kid Planet.

53:42.400 --> 53:42.960
I got to go.

53:42.960 --> 53:44.000
Oh, it's Ice Planet Hoff.

53:44.000 --> 53:44.800
We haven't seen Luke in a while.

53:44.800 --> 53:45.840
I'm going to go out looking for him.

53:45.840 --> 53:49.520
And I'm going to go just drop off a few little crack nugs.

53:49.520 --> 53:52.560
I also got to go poach some wampa.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.760
You know, he was stoked when he heard it was the Ice Planet.

53:57.760 --> 53:58.560
He gets up there.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.880
He's like, well, this is not what I expected at all.

54:00.880 --> 54:05.680
This is a much more literal take on that concept than I sort of expected.

54:05.680 --> 54:08.240
Yeah, I bet he smuggled some really dope shit, though.

54:08.240 --> 54:08.960
Oh, no.

54:08.960 --> 54:12.560
Yeah, he smuggled robots and like fucking war heroes.

54:12.560 --> 54:15.040
And like he had those monsters in the worst scene in the new movie.

54:15.040 --> 54:17.520
But then like, then there was-

54:17.520 --> 54:19.440
How very much he drew a line anywhere.

54:20.080 --> 54:20.800
No, God, no.

54:20.800 --> 54:21.840
He's got to get to work where he can.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.440
It's definitely a competitive field.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.920
If somebody wants him to take crack to Kid Planet, like-

54:27.120 --> 54:27.760
Here's the thing.

54:27.760 --> 54:30.320
The thing that's crazier is when the new movie starts.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.000
Hustle's in the new movie, by the way.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.280
When the new movie starts, he's back on his grind.

54:35.280 --> 54:35.600
Yeah, no.

54:35.600 --> 54:39.520
He's in there hunting and you know he's moving that good stuff.

54:39.520 --> 54:40.080
Yeah.

54:40.080 --> 54:43.760
I got a shipment of Ewok gallbladders here.

54:43.760 --> 54:44.240
Keep it down.

54:44.240 --> 54:44.720
Keep it down.

54:44.720 --> 54:45.200
Keep it down.

54:45.200 --> 54:46.800
Shit's illegal on this planet.

54:46.800 --> 54:47.440
You smoke, though.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.000
Legal everywhere.

54:48.000 --> 54:48.480
Enjoy.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.840
I got to go deliver some crack.

54:49.840 --> 54:50.800
You smoke some of that.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.160
Oh, man.

54:53.520 --> 54:55.680
Why do you think those old guys are so happy all the fucking time?

54:56.720 --> 54:58.320
It's because their livers produce crack.

55:00.720 --> 55:01.520
That's where it comes from.

55:02.320 --> 55:03.600
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

55:03.600 --> 55:06.080
Thank you so much for listening.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.640
We have a few things that we just want to run through.

55:10.640 --> 55:14.240
If you're going to be at our live shows in early June in DC and New York,

55:14.800 --> 55:16.880
sadly, they're sold out if you don't already have tickets.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.480
But if you do have tickets, you're going to be there.

55:18.480 --> 55:21.280
Please send us questions to address at the show.

55:23.360 --> 55:28.560
Send in questions with DC Live Show or NYC Live Show in the subject line.

55:28.560 --> 55:29.120
All caps.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.080
We make sure to see it.

55:30.720 --> 55:32.880
If you're planning on asking us a question at the show,

55:32.880 --> 55:34.560
don't not send in a question because of that.

55:34.560 --> 55:38.080
Because honestly, we only get to three or four audience questions,

55:38.080 --> 55:40.960
and we always have tons of people waiting.

55:40.960 --> 55:44.640
So go ahead and send in your questions, and we'll answer them during the show.

55:47.920 --> 55:48.480
You all right?

55:48.480 --> 55:49.600
You get exhausted?

55:49.600 --> 55:51.280
I just thought you guys would pick it up and say something.

55:51.280 --> 55:51.760
You did great.

55:51.760 --> 55:52.960
You didn't leave any breaks.

55:52.960 --> 55:56.160
I was waiting for the end of your pain to sigh.

55:56.960 --> 55:57.680
Yeah.

55:57.680 --> 55:58.560
Yeah, I mean, that's it.

55:59.840 --> 56:01.920
I just did an interview on Uproxx.

56:01.920 --> 56:03.200
That was really fun.

56:03.200 --> 56:04.400
Yeah, that was cool, Travis.

56:04.400 --> 56:06.000
That made me feel like you're a big deal.

56:06.880 --> 56:08.320
It's nice to feel like a big deal for once.

56:08.320 --> 56:08.880
You can check that out.

56:08.880 --> 56:13.280
I'll tweet it, or you can just search like Uproxx with two X's and Travis McElroy.

56:13.280 --> 56:13.680
And it comes up.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.600
It was a lovely interview with David Pemberton.

56:15.600 --> 56:16.320
It was really good.

56:16.880 --> 56:18.960
So there's a bunch of other shows on the Max Fun Network.

56:18.960 --> 56:21.680
If you like this show, I guarantee you there will be at least one other show on the network.

56:21.680 --> 56:24.320
Probably like eight other shows on the network, though, that you'll really enjoy.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.880
I'm talking about shows like the Beef and Dairy Network.

56:26.880 --> 56:29.360
I'm talking about shows like Throwing Shade.

56:29.360 --> 56:33.360
I'm talking about shows like Jordan Jesse Go and Judge John Hodgman and Stop Podcasting Yourself.

56:33.360 --> 56:34.400
There's a ton of really good shows.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.960
If you want to hear us do more shows, go to McElroyShows.com.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.200
We've got a bunch of other podcasts like The Adventure Zone.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.280
We're about to start a new arc on The Adventure Zone.

56:41.280 --> 56:44.240
I would say it's actually a good time to get on because we're about to start a new arc.

56:44.240 --> 56:48.640
But I feel like at this point, you should probably start at the beginning or else you'll be lost.

56:48.640 --> 56:54.560
But I also want to plug Rose Buddies, which is the bachelor themed show that I do with my wife,

56:54.560 --> 56:54.960
Rachel.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.040
I'm very, very proud of this show.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.880
I love doing it so much.

56:58.880 --> 57:01.760
And a new season of The Bachelor starts tonight.

57:01.760 --> 57:02.800
It's actually The Bachelor, right?

57:02.800 --> 57:03.600
Inspired by you, Griffin.

57:03.600 --> 57:04.880
I got a group together.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.320
You're fucking kidding.

57:06.320 --> 57:07.840
And we're doing the draft and everything.

57:07.840 --> 57:08.400
Yeah, we have.

57:08.400 --> 57:11.440
So our last episode was a preview of this upcoming season.

57:11.440 --> 57:14.640
And then Rules for How We Do Our Fantasy League.

57:14.640 --> 57:15.440
It's so much fun.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.840
Yeah, that was our most recent episode.

57:17.840 --> 57:21.280
So you could listen to that today and be ready for the episode tonight.

57:21.280 --> 57:22.880
And then listen all season while we talk about it.

57:22.880 --> 57:24.320
Anyway, that's one of the shows.

57:24.320 --> 57:25.600
There's many, many other ones.

57:25.600 --> 57:29.200
I also wanted to plug one of my shows that's not on any network, a little independent show

57:29.200 --> 57:33.200
called Interrobang with Travis and Tybee, where we talk about things that are frustrating us,

57:33.200 --> 57:34.640
so maybe frustrating you.

57:34.640 --> 57:40.320
And it's a very honest, heartfelt, scary, scary show to make.

57:40.320 --> 57:42.000
And I really love doing it.

57:42.000 --> 57:42.720
And it's a great show.

57:42.720 --> 57:43.680
And people seem to like it.

57:43.680 --> 57:44.720
And I'd love for you to check it out.

57:44.720 --> 57:48.240
You can go to interrobangcast.com and check it out.

57:48.240 --> 57:50.960
Also, Justin and I are doing a series of Monster Factory videos.

57:50.960 --> 57:54.880
If you've never watched Monster Factory, it's videos that me and Justin do for Polygon where

57:54.880 --> 57:59.600
we make ugly, ugly, not ugly, they're beautiful characters in games that allow you to do so.

57:59.600 --> 58:01.360
And then challenging, challenging characters.

58:01.360 --> 58:02.640
Let me just fuck games up.

58:02.640 --> 58:07.520
And then Totino's friend of the family at this point, Totino's, who sponsored the McElroy

58:07.520 --> 58:14.800
family, Totino's Fun Hour here on my Bim Bam, has sponsored a three episode run of Monster

58:14.800 --> 58:18.400
Factory episodes, which we are conducting in Second Life.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.960
The second of those three episodes goes up today.

58:20.960 --> 58:25.840
And holy fucking shit, it turned out so good, Justin.

58:26.560 --> 58:27.440
Oh, really?

58:27.440 --> 58:27.920
Is it good?

58:27.920 --> 58:29.280
It's a good old episode.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.800
Yeah, so yeah, go check out Monster Factory.

58:32.800 --> 58:33.520
You can find it on YouTube.

58:33.520 --> 58:34.800
You can find it on Polygon's YouTube channel.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.960
You can just search Monster Factory and you'll find it there.

58:36.960 --> 58:38.880
You can also go to McElroyShows.com.

58:38.880 --> 58:42.720
Everything's there, including our contact and our Twitters and Facebook, everything.

58:44.080 --> 58:47.360
Thanks to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

58:47.360 --> 58:48.640
off Putting the Days to Bed.

58:48.640 --> 58:51.040
It's a really, really great album.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.560
Get started listening to it now.

58:52.560 --> 58:54.000
It'll get pumped for the summer months.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.040
I know it's a band called The Long Winters, but you can listen to it for all seasons.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.800
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

58:58.800 --> 58:59.680
Oh, hell yeah, I do.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.120
This one's sent in by Aaron Keys.

59:01.120 --> 59:01.840
Thank you, Aaron.

59:02.480 --> 59:03.680
Aaron might need a nickname soon.

59:04.400 --> 59:06.320
It's from Yahoo Answers user Bruce.

59:06.320 --> 59:07.200
The Keyster.

59:07.200 --> 59:08.000
The Keyster.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.120
That's terrible.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.240
We'll come up with something better.

59:10.240 --> 59:13.120
It's from Yahoo Answers user, and this is all caps, so I am going to shout it.

59:13.120 --> 59:13.920
I apologize.

59:13.920 --> 59:14.420
Bruce!

59:14.420 --> 59:19.700
And then Bruce's question is also in all caps, so I'm going to have to shout it as well.

59:19.700 --> 59:20.660
I apologize.

59:20.660 --> 59:21.540
Bruce's question is...

59:23.380 --> 59:25.220
Is this Yahoo email support?

59:32.180 --> 59:33.460
My name's Justin McElroy.

59:33.460 --> 59:34.420
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:34.420 --> 59:35.700
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:35.700 --> 59:36.900
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

59:36.900 --> 59:37.620
Kiss your dad.

59:37.620 --> 59:48.820
Square on the lips.

59:55.780 --> 59:57.700

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.700
Hi, everybody.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.980
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.580
And I'm Dr. Sidney McElroy.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:12.740
Every Tuesday, we bring you Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine, a show about all

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:17.300
the dumb, weird, terrible ways that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.460
You know, some light summer listening.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:24.100
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas or why we tried to eat mummies for a while

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.620
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:33.780
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday right here on the Maximum Fun Network

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:41.460
with Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine.
