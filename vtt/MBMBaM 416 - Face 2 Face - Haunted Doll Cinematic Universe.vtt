WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.600
This is the energy you want? We're not illuminated by light at all.

00:48.320 --> 00:52.320
It's kind of like, welcome to my show. I'm just saying, I saw this mic here,

00:52.320 --> 00:55.760
I was like, never talked to that one. I mean, if you want to see how long you

00:55.760 --> 00:58.960
can make that last, I'm all for experiment. We've done this like a hundred times now,

00:58.960 --> 01:01.280
if you want to experiment. We've done it a hundred times,

01:01.280 --> 01:04.560
but we've never done it in Space City. What's up, Houston?

01:04.560 --> 01:28.240
Keep it going, Bayou City. Let me hear you, Hustletown. Come on.

01:28.240 --> 01:34.880
Come on. You're looking at me like I don't know Clutch City. These are my people.

01:38.320 --> 01:42.240
What's up? So excited to be here. Welcome, my brother. My brother,

01:42.240 --> 01:47.920
meet advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:47.920 --> 01:59.120
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

02:05.360 --> 02:15.040
Yeah. I'm a sweet baby boy. I didn't, okay. I want Justin to do his tie five.

02:15.040 --> 02:23.360
Yeah. Justin is standing at his own microphone. My name? I'm Griffin McElroy,

02:23.360 --> 02:32.800
30 under 30 media luminary baby. All right. So anyway, so happy to be here.

02:32.800 --> 02:37.200
This is just how my brain works, people. Listen, when you go on an airplane

02:37.200 --> 02:45.440
and they give you food and you eat it, sometimes it's different.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.680
Wait, Justin, I think we have something that'll help.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.960
Can we get him a bottle of water? Here, Justin, Justin, Justin, take this bottle of water too.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.000
Well, you don't sit. You don't actually sit. The stool is just there.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.680
He's hit a meaningful part. No, this is great. So now, okay,

03:09.680 --> 03:12.560
Justin's doing a lot of prop comedy. Sometimes people listen to this later. He's got his own

03:12.560 --> 03:16.320
stand microphone and he was just holding it about one foot off the ground, which

03:16.320 --> 03:22.080
looked really natural and very comfortable. Do the thing where you take the mic off the stand

03:22.080 --> 03:24.640
and kind of lean the stand a little bit while you talk into the microphone.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.760
No, not that. You're not seducing the mic stand.

03:27.760 --> 03:38.560
If I sit on a stool like this, all I want to do is sing Fast Car. All right. Listen,

03:39.680 --> 03:43.600
we've been living in this moment for a while and we can all agree it was a mistake.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.920
I'd like to come back to my seat now. You are welcome to come back to the table.

03:47.920 --> 03:48.960
Thank you. Thank you.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.880
Welcome Justin McElroy.

03:50.880 --> 03:59.840
I didn't realize that part of the pre-show prep involved going on Wikipedia to learn all of the

03:59.840 --> 04:02.160
Houston nicknames. So now I feel like a bad person.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.680
I'm a native son.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.040
You're not even at all.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.400
Houston, and am I a native son?

04:10.640 --> 04:11.140
Okay.

04:12.960 --> 04:18.240
That's how we talk in Houston, Griffin. Don't even make fun of my stumbling on the words.

04:18.240 --> 04:23.680
I'm still very nervous from over there. I felt very put on the spot, literally.

04:24.480 --> 04:30.000
The table hides a lot. The table hides a whole lot.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.960
Like maybe my zipper's down, but it's not. I checked it.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.360
I always check it while I'm walking on stage.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.640
That's the god on us too.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.960
Yeah. If you pay attention, you'll see all three of us just real quick.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.280
Just go like, that's our like little ear pull.

04:41.280 --> 04:48.160
So, God, I forget what we were even going to do for intro,

04:48.160 --> 04:50.080
because what Justin did was just so good.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.440
History will be the judge of that.

04:55.200 --> 04:55.920
Okay.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.480
We were backstage. Justin was looking at Houston nicknames.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.560
I was on my phone, I saw a news story, and I started talking about it to the boys,

05:02.560 --> 05:04.480
and we all sort of realized, no, hold on.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.160
We got to talk about this in front of the folks.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.040
We never do this on this show, but it was so important and so,

05:09.040 --> 05:14.960
so I think it could be a launchpad for some of our twisted skewed advice.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.040
It's time for us to talk about topicalness.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.400
Yes. Well, there's a nature photographer.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.480
Topical or tropical?

05:23.680 --> 05:27.360
He was in a rainforest in Indonesia, so close, I guess.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.440
He's taking pictures and he leaves his camera out.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.480
This is in a segment called

05:34.480 --> 05:37.680
What Griffin Remembers of the News Story He Read 30 Minutes Ago.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.720
You would think he has a computer. I assumed he had it pulled up.

05:40.720 --> 05:41.920
No, better like this.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.080
Taking pictures, walks away from his camera for a little bit,

05:44.080 --> 05:46.400
which is like, cameraman, you don't do that.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.920
Photographer, you got to leave it out there.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.720
But no, you don't leave it out there, because what happens next is

05:50.720 --> 05:53.600
a monkey comes down from a tree, takes a selfie with it.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.120
It's very good, this image.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.480
The photographer says, that's my image.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.200
Wikipedia puts it on Wikipedia, says, no, it's Creative Commons

06:01.200 --> 06:02.960
because you didn't take it. A monkey did.

06:02.960 --> 06:07.280
This is the first of eight layers of this story.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.960
Photographer tries to get it taken down from Wikipedia.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.040
Wikipedia says, no, a monkey took it, you didn't take it.

06:11.040 --> 06:11.840
He gives up.

06:12.800 --> 06:17.440
PETA sues the photographer for including the image in a book

06:17.440 --> 06:19.920
that he printed and sold, saying, that's not your image.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.160
You are violating the monkey's trademark.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.680
Or copyright, not trademark.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.360
This is what Griffin remembers of the news.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.480
The monkey mailed the photo to himself and didn't know that.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.760
PETA and the photographer get together to talk about it.

06:33.760 --> 06:38.320
Apparently, there's some precedent where people representing all dolphins ever

06:38.320 --> 06:41.840
sued the Navy for using sonar and the dolphins lost.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.880
PETA was like, we don't want to establish a precedent by bringing this to court.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.280
Let's settle. That's pretty wild.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.480
If you've wondered why dolphins have had a little spring in their step,

06:50.480 --> 06:52.720
a few extra bucks in their wallet, that's why.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.080
Nice class action.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.280
They decide to settle. PETA and the photographer decide to settle.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.120
PETA and the photographer decide to settle.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.040
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals says,

07:03.600 --> 07:05.600
no, we're going to hear this one fucking out.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.960
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals says,

07:10.960 --> 07:12.960
actually, we're going to get into this one.

07:13.840 --> 07:14.480
We want to find out.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.840
This far, no farther.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.760
We've had a lot of boring ones lately, and we want a fun one.

07:19.760 --> 07:20.080
Yeah.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.840
About monkey photographers.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.920
We want to have our own Scopes monkey trial.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.520
The reason why they wanted to take it to trial.

07:28.080 --> 07:28.960
That was very good.

07:28.960 --> 07:29.600
It was very good.

07:30.160 --> 07:34.000
The reason why they wanted to take it to trial is because PETA agreed to settle.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.600
The photographer agreed to settle.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.680
The monkey did not agree to settle.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.240
That's a great point.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.760
If the monkey has the right to claim a photograph as his own,

07:43.760 --> 07:46.080
the monkey has a right to legal representation.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.200
This is all true, by the way, as is this last delicious layer on the onion.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.680
The monkey's name is Naruto.

07:53.680 --> 08:05.120
Now, so much, so much bad news this week was in some small part counteracted by

08:05.120 --> 08:08.880
Naruto the photo monkey, and we've got him here tonight.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.480
Naruto, come on out.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.840
Oh, he's attacking us.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.800
I do want to, I do want to change your verbiage just for a second.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.480
The monkey has been named Naruto.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.880
The monkey was not like, hi, I'm Naruto.

08:20.880 --> 08:21.840
I took the photo.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.600
So please credit me.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.360
You owe me some royalties, I believe.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.720
Would you like it in the form of bananas?

08:28.720 --> 08:30.400
No, I want fucking money.

08:30.400 --> 08:30.720
Money.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.440
Money.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.040
I have a mortgage.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.160
I have a mortgage.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.800
Do you have bananas, by the way, while we're on the subject?

08:36.800 --> 08:38.480
But also, banana wouldn't hurt.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.760
A banana would be nice.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.280
I have a yahoo here, if you would allow me to.

08:43.280 --> 08:51.200
Somewhat, now that I'm reading it, similar to our opening topic.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.120
Sent in by Carl Vincent Boddy.

08:53.120 --> 08:53.680
Thank you, Carl.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.240
It's yahoo answers user.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.560
Sorry, something's gone wrong on yahoo.

09:00.240 --> 09:06.560
Oh, the website disappeared before I could read it.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.440
Gonna check back into the web.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.880
Are you guys, do you guys have spotlights on you?

09:12.880 --> 09:14.320
Because it's sweltering.

09:14.320 --> 09:14.960
It's pretty warm.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.960
Are we all equally very uncomfortable right now?

09:16.960 --> 09:18.640
All right, it's by yahoo answers user.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.680
It's just not going to fucking load.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.600
This is a trash website.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.200
yahoo answers user Naruto.

09:25.200 --> 09:33.120
Naruto the photo monkey asks, can you make a Doritos commercial without copyrights?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.760
My friends and I were planning to make a Doritos commercial and show it to the school.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.480
My dad pointed out that there might be copyright issues.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.320
Fucking dad of the year.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.120
Yeah, that's a clutch play from that.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.200
Clutch, we are not planning.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.960
Clutch city recognizes a clutch play.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.840
We are not, okay.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.480
And that's just going to buy us 10 seconds every time.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.840
We are not planning to post it or make money off of it.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.240
That's not how copyright law works.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.880
We actually saying the word Doritos up here is probably against the law.

10:06.880 --> 10:10.560
Yeah, we will call them stinky tortilla chips.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.800
Faux Ritos.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.480
That's still not going to hold up.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.160
I think if you land in the Ritos family, I think they can still get you.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.360
Yeah, Doritos.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.360
Doritos works actually.

10:25.360 --> 10:25.760
Thank you.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.680
This dad, you're going to, yeah, we're going to make a Doritos commercial

10:31.680 --> 10:34.800
and show it to the whole school and they'll remember it forever.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.320
Copyright, you can't copyright.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.400
That's it, copyright, copyright.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
They'll take you to chip jail.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.360
Chip jail where?

10:43.360 --> 10:46.960
You're my beautiful child and I can't watch you go down like that.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.680
You're too talented at movies.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.600
All right, Cliff, you oversold it.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
Listen, Cliff, you oversold it.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.640
I know, brain, I know.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.240
I got greedy.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.720
Pull it back in, Cliff, you've got this.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.880
I mean, if Doritos doesn't find out, you're probably okay, right?

11:06.880 --> 11:10.720
But you never know who the secret Doritos spies are.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.320
The coolest kid is like Doritos release.

11:14.320 --> 11:19.840
Yeah, if there's a kid in your class who skateboard, who?

11:21.760 --> 11:22.240
Crunch?

11:22.880 --> 11:23.440
He crunch.

11:25.920 --> 11:29.200
His name is Ranch, but he's very cool, so everybody calls him Cool Ranch.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.200
His name is Xavier Stream, but it's called Extreme.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.640
One surefire sign, the breath and fingers.

11:38.640 --> 11:39.140
Yes.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.640
Check the breath, scope the fingers.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.800
That's how you know if it's a secret Doritos cop.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.400
That's why he's always wearing gloves.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.560
A zest, a zest unbelievable.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.080
And at his age, and when he eats chips that aren't Doritos,

11:52.080 --> 11:53.360
they turn to ash in his mouth.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.280
We've just mixed our metaphors.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.240
I was talking about a secret cop employee of Doritos

12:00.240 --> 12:03.120
and you did somebody who suffered a terrible Doritos curse.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.200
No, I said that chips that aren't Doritos turn to ash in his mouth.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.080
Again, a terrible, I guess, Doritos curse.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.440
Why would he want to eat any?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.360
He would have a chip in his body.

12:13.360 --> 12:13.840
You're right.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.600
That made it so he could only eat Doritos.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.320
You're right.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.280
I'm the wrong one.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.600
What, unless, unless?

12:24.880 --> 12:26.880
What if it's a very good Doritos commercial

12:26.880 --> 12:28.880
that everybody in your school likes a whole lot

12:28.880 --> 12:32.560
and makes him go buy Doritos and gets you hired

12:32.560 --> 12:35.200
as the new Doritos Super Bowl commercial person?

12:36.720 --> 12:37.360
Officially.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.400
Official.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.080
That's the thing is copyright law,

12:40.080 --> 12:42.960
the tiny, tiny loophole is unless it's good.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.080
Unless it's good and we like it.

12:44.080 --> 12:44.580
True.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.400
You know, you hear a lot of game designers

12:48.400 --> 12:50.720
get their start making like Doom levels.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.520
Maybe this is how you get your start making Doritos commercials

12:53.520 --> 12:55.680
is you make your own, sweeted.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.280
You can't even afford Doritos.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.760
You just have to write it on a plastic bag

13:00.320 --> 13:03.040
and fill it with dirty chips.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.680
Can you make your own Doritos at home?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.680
Can you sweet Doritos?

13:11.680 --> 13:13.120
The chip, not for a commercial.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.720
I know where to get tortilla chips.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.320
I know where to get pizza.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.440
Can I find some?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.240
Do they just grind that shit down and just rub it?

13:20.240 --> 13:23.360
Throw it into a fan with the chips hanging in front of it?

13:23.360 --> 13:23.680
Yes.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.880
Sell those on the playground.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.000
25 cents a bag.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.680
Oh no, word's gotten out.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.800
Cool ranch is coming.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.720
Shut it down.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.840
I got chips.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.840
I have a gallon size Tupperware container

13:33.840 --> 13:36.720
that my grandfather passed down to me that's labeled zest.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.160
So we just mix those together.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.880
How about a regular question?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, it's very warm.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Woo!

13:51.040 --> 13:55.040
If you're listening later, I just pulled my shirt off very cool.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.000
Very cool.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.320
And everybody was so excited about how smooth it was.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.840
Like I'd taken off my shirt before.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.520
Five of his muscles popped out.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.840
How about a question from our beloved audience?

14:05.840 --> 14:09.120
Here on my Bim Bam, we take your questions

14:09.120 --> 14:10.640
and turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.480
This is our first question.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.120
My girlfriend and I have been dating.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.400
No, wait, no.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.120
Yes, that's right.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.640
My girlfriend and I have been dating long distance

14:20.640 --> 14:21.520
for almost a year now.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.480
And recently I went to visit her and her family.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.400
Upon arriving, I found out my girlfriend's dad

14:26.400 --> 14:28.880
is a pro Wii Sports bowler.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.640
He goes to tournaments.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.520
Thank you to him from us.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.120
He goes to tournaments weekly and takes it so seriously

14:39.120 --> 14:41.840
that he stays up until 2 a.m. some nights to practice.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.400
Fuck yes.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.120
It's actually not healthy.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.520
You have to take care of your body as a pro.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.960
Well, he sleeps till 2 p.m.

14:48.960 --> 14:49.840
I'll tell you this.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.880
He's got one super healthy appendage

14:52.880 --> 14:56.080
and it's whichever one he holds the Wiimote with.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.440
Weekly tournaments?

14:58.320 --> 14:58.720
Where?

14:58.720 --> 15:00.800
Is that scene still that hot?

15:00.800 --> 15:01.680
Weekly?

15:03.840 --> 15:07.200
Weekly cash tournaments that he has gone pro?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.760
I'm not great at bowling, virtual or reality,

15:11.760 --> 15:13.440
but I want his approval.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.680
What can I do to impress him or at least show

15:15.680 --> 15:17.920
that I appreciate his virtual technique?

15:18.720 --> 15:22.720
And that's from Hoping for a Strike in Houston, Texas.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.760
I mean, are you here?

15:25.360 --> 15:26.080
Sure.

15:26.080 --> 15:26.800
Wait, are you here?

15:30.960 --> 15:32.240
Are you Legion?

15:32.240 --> 15:32.560
Yeah.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.960
Why is your question about your girlfriend's dad

15:34.960 --> 15:36.640
and not about how you're a hive mind?

15:38.960 --> 15:41.200
I mean, if you just want to prove that you appreciate

15:42.000 --> 15:44.640
his ability, just watch him and go, nice.

15:44.640 --> 15:44.880
Nice.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.920
That was real good, Doug.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.480
There are very few reactions you can give to watching

15:50.480 --> 15:53.360
somebody wee-bowl that don't feel like you're full of shit.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.240
I feel like.

15:54.240 --> 15:54.960
Yeah.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.600
I feel like, oh, nice is about it.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.000
And then anything like, oh, yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.440
They're just going to assume you're being an asshole.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.640
The right reaction is this.

16:04.720 --> 16:05.040
Nice.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.120
Why are you getting high in front of bowling dad?

16:11.840 --> 16:12.960
I mean, it's 2 a.m.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.840
He's wee-bowling.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.920
Yeah, he is high, isn't he?

16:15.920 --> 16:18.720
Yeah.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.120
Also, my girlfriend's dad loves cocaine.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.000
That's another thing.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.120
Just mountains of that good white stuff.

16:26.160 --> 16:26.960
Crazy about it.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.560
Well, that's what happens on the pro scene.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.440
That's the pro scene.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.880
That's the pro wee-bowling scene.

16:30.880 --> 16:31.920
It's nasty out there.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.200
Pro?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.480
He doesn't have another job?

16:34.480 --> 16:36.480
Is this what esports is?

16:36.480 --> 16:36.720
Yeah.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.720
I've worked in the industry for a literal decade now,

16:40.720 --> 16:42.800
and I'm still not sure what people are talking about.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.040
I think they just misspelled the word sports,

16:45.040 --> 16:47.120
and I don't think that's that unreasonable.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.120
Esports is when you take the hard part of doing the thing

16:51.120 --> 16:52.400
and make it easy.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.640
That's true, because if you think about the difference

16:54.640 --> 16:58.720
between playing football versus playing a Madden game,

16:58.720 --> 17:00.320
it's a big, big physical difference.

17:00.320 --> 17:04.320
Or murdering a bunch of people in a shooting game.

17:04.320 --> 17:07.200
But the difference between real bowling and wee-bowling

17:07.200 --> 17:08.160
is just removing mass.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.680
It's about 11 pounds.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.960
Yeah, about 11 pounds.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.440
Otherwise, pretty much the same activity.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.040
Pretty much the same thing.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.160
What if you glued a bowling ball to his wee-mote

17:18.160 --> 17:19.440
and said, I got you this.

17:20.240 --> 17:24.320
That'll really just fucking fuck his TV right up.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.320
Are you kidding me?

17:26.320 --> 17:29.280
That'll fuck the drywall behind the TV up.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.480
That'll fuck up the TV in the next house over.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.440
I do like that, though.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.960
You've got to, I mean, you've got to beat him, right?

17:42.960 --> 17:43.760
You have to beat him.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.440
Oh, you're not gonna.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.560
You're not gonna.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.000
Unless, I don't think I actually had one.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.920
No, actually what you have to do for this to work,

17:53.920 --> 17:55.760
you have to almost beat him.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.000
You have to eke out a close loss, right?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.920
Of like, you're one point behind him.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.840
So it's like, I respect your game, but I'm the pro here, right?

18:05.840 --> 18:07.440
So then it balances out.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.160
Because if you beat him-

18:08.160 --> 18:10.880
He's gonna smell that taking a dive with the betting

18:10.880 --> 18:11.600
in that scene.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.360
You think he's not gonna see someone taking a dive?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.240
Okay, hold on.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.440
Unless, I gotta know.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.120
I thought of one.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.400
This isn't how it usually works.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.200
But unless you wait for him to get like sick,

18:21.200 --> 18:22.320
and then you play him.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.800
Like the flu or something.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.440
Okay, got it.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.560
And then you just crush him,

18:28.560 --> 18:32.160
because his weak body can't handle the sports you're bringing.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.080
And you put super heavy batteries in his controller, too.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.760
Yes.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.400
Hi, is this Circuit City?

18:44.400 --> 18:44.960
Yes, it is.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.360
Why are you still open?

18:49.200 --> 18:50.160
We're the last one.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.120
I bought this store.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.200
This is the Circuit City?

18:53.200 --> 18:53.840
I'm the mayor.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.240
Welcome.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.520
Thank you for calling the last Circuit City.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.160
How can I help you?

18:58.880 --> 19:02.000
Yes, I need some very heavy batteries.

19:02.000 --> 19:02.720
And-

19:02.720 --> 19:03.680
Of course, sir.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.400
Is this for-

19:04.400 --> 19:06.320
No, before you ask, it's not for a dad prank.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.800
Also, if you roll the bowling ball

19:10.800 --> 19:13.440
on the side of the bowling alley where the wall is,

19:13.440 --> 19:15.600
and get it to go on top all the way to the end,

19:15.600 --> 19:18.240
all the bowling pins fall over and there's a big explosion.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.680
That's a cheat code.

19:19.680 --> 19:20.960
And you can use that.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.120
It's the truth.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.000
I didn't make it up.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.680
Roll it on the top.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.560
I beat so many kids at Toys R Us with that.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.600
And they were like, what?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.400
That's cheating.

19:30.400 --> 19:34.800
And I was like, it's in the game.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.320
Just fucking take him real bowling.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.480
There's no way on earth he wouldn't-

19:40.480 --> 19:42.240
What if he doesn't know about real bowling?

19:45.040 --> 19:47.680
What if he got Wii bowling and was like, oh, I love this.

19:47.680 --> 19:48.400
I love this.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.360
Who came up with this?

19:49.360 --> 19:50.000
This is great.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And then you're like, hey, oh, shit.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.960
Take it one step further.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.480
I know how much you love Wii bowling,

19:54.480 --> 19:56.160
so I built this place for you.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.920
It's like my game.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.360
Valerie, it's like the game you got me.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.800
It's like the game I love.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.600
Bowling.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.040
I call it Doug's ball.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.560
There is no real bowling.

20:06.560 --> 20:09.120
How's the ball even supposed to come back?

20:09.120 --> 20:10.880
It's a video game.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.120
You think there's a little plumber running around

20:13.120 --> 20:14.320
stomping on mushroom men?

20:14.960 --> 20:15.840
Get it together.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.520
It's in the game.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.640
Bowling's imaginary.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.640
Griffin, how about another Yahoo answer question?

20:22.640 --> 20:23.360
Yeah, absolutely.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.320
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.440
Thank you, Adrian.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.640
It's Yahoo Answers user Kanabid.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.680
No, it's just some letters.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.400
Asks, if you were part of a construction crew

20:40.400 --> 20:42.080
and while digging the foundation,

20:42.080 --> 20:45.120
you stumbled upon ancient gold coins,

20:45.120 --> 20:46.240
what would you do then?

20:49.600 --> 20:52.480
Would you report the find to the archaeology department

20:52.480 --> 20:57.520
of the construction company?

20:57.520 --> 20:59.520
Illegally, they have to have one

20:59.520 --> 21:00.800
and usually they're very bored.

21:00.800 --> 21:01.120
Yeah.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.520
What did you find, spark plug?

21:03.520 --> 21:04.080
Cool.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.240
How qualified does that position have to be?

21:06.240 --> 21:08.080
I'm going to go back to practicing Wii bowling.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.000
We found like a hundred skeletons.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.360
Shit.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.520
Okay, that's my day.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.000
All right.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.600
Human, human skeletons or not?

21:19.600 --> 21:23.200
Would you report it to the archaeology department

21:23.200 --> 21:24.640
or would you and your colleagues

21:24.640 --> 21:27.120
share the quote unquote bounty?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.600
I don't know why you needed a quote unquote bounty on that.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.240
That's a bounty you got there, my son.

21:32.240 --> 21:32.480
Yeah.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.760
After reporting, would you stuff some in your pocket,

21:35.760 --> 21:37.360
take home and sell them online

21:37.360 --> 21:39.760
or would you turn them all to the government?

21:41.200 --> 21:41.440
Hey.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.360
Hey, is this City Hall?

21:43.360 --> 21:44.480
Is this City Hall?

21:44.480 --> 21:45.360
Is this government?

21:46.720 --> 21:46.960
Okay.

21:48.080 --> 21:48.960
Correct me if I'm wrong.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.960
This is a question in two parts, right?

21:50.960 --> 21:53.120
Because it's would you keep it for yourself

21:53.120 --> 21:54.000
or would you report?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.760
And if you reported, would you still-

21:55.760 --> 21:57.040
Still steal a little bit.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.720
That's the wild part to me.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.360
Like, why do you need that heat?

22:01.360 --> 22:02.880
Like, you just want to feel it?

22:02.880 --> 22:03.760
You want to feel something,

22:03.760 --> 22:06.000
so you want to steal when they know they're watching you?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.840
Like, you don't think that might pop up

22:07.840 --> 22:09.600
if you're on the eBay and they're like,

22:09.600 --> 22:11.920
hey, you know that big box of coins you gave us?

22:11.920 --> 22:13.920
Some of those also showed up over there.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.640
Isn't that weird?

22:16.240 --> 22:16.960
I wouldn't touch it.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.600
It's cursed.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.640
It's not.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.240
It's clearly cursed.

22:20.240 --> 22:20.960
It's cursed.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.840
I've seen Pirates of the Caribbean and Black Pearl 12 times.

22:25.200 --> 22:25.680
Today.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.360
He watches it on six TVs twice.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.240
Dang it.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.320
I watch it at 1.5 speed.

22:34.320 --> 22:34.720
If you-

22:35.760 --> 22:38.480
I don't think you can just steal it and sell it

22:38.480 --> 22:41.360
because you don't know how much it's worth

22:41.360 --> 22:43.040
and if it's very good gold coins

22:43.040 --> 22:44.880
or if they're just okay gold coins,

22:44.880 --> 22:45.680
you don't know.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.760
You don't know what the minimum bid should be.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.160
Yeah, you don't want to walk into a pawn shop and hand it to them

22:50.160 --> 22:51.760
like, these are all Chuck E. Cheese tokens.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.080
Right.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.440
You need an expert to evaluate them,

22:55.440 --> 22:57.360
like the experts at Pawn Stars,

22:57.360 --> 22:58.560
to look at them and say,

22:59.200 --> 23:01.360
all right, these are very good.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.320
Congratulations.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.160
You're going to be a very rich person.

23:04.160 --> 23:04.960
$200.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.200
$200.

23:07.200 --> 23:07.440
Yeah.

23:08.160 --> 23:08.960
I have another question.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.720
When I'm walking, I love to skip.

23:13.520 --> 23:13.840
Okay.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.640
Hey, the problem is that I'm 31 years old.

23:17.280 --> 23:20.000
I'll glance around furtively to check that no one's around to see

23:20.000 --> 23:21.360
and then off I go.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.160
The wind in my hair, the floaty bounce down the street.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.040
It feels great.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.120
But if someone sees, they look at me like I'm bat shit

23:29.120 --> 23:30.720
and the moment is ruined.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.400
At some point between child and adult, skipping becomes taboo

23:34.400 --> 23:36.000
and then everyone loses out.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.480
Hey brothers, how can we bring skipping for adults out from the underworld

23:40.480 --> 23:42.240
and give everyone the freedom

23:42.240 --> 23:43.920
to have a little bounce in their step?

23:47.360 --> 23:48.960
That's from Can't Stop the Skip,

23:48.960 --> 23:52.560
who I bet just got a lot more affirmation than they expected.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.600
Can we all agree that like skipping rules?

23:58.080 --> 24:01.040
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.560
We have a lot of fun here

24:02.560 --> 24:04.400
and sometimes y'all I feel like you're pressured

24:04.400 --> 24:05.920
to agree with anything we say.

24:08.320 --> 24:08.960
It's great.

24:08.960 --> 24:09.520
No, it's great.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.320
Wait, when was the last time you skipped though?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.960
We're getting a lot of actual answers.

24:16.960 --> 24:17.360
Okay, yeah.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.240
Three weeks!

24:19.840 --> 24:22.800
I wrote it on a calendar because I had so much fun doing it.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.040
Nine days, 13 hours.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.920
And I knew I'd be tested at some point in the future.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.720
It's just, it is that it's weird

24:32.720 --> 24:34.720
because I don't know exactly where the point is

24:34.720 --> 24:36.240
but I see a six-year-old skipping.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.760
I think, ah, Americana, beautiful, freedom, go for it.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.160
Yeah.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.600
I see a 16-year-old skipping.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.040
I'm like, what is going on?

24:43.040 --> 24:45.360
Yeah, what did they steal?

24:45.360 --> 24:46.240
What did they huff?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.040
They're on that skip.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.840
They're huffing skip.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.800
Oh, but I'll tell you the worst thing of all, Chief,

24:54.800 --> 24:57.360
the worst thing of all, there's a counter on that ball.

24:57.360 --> 24:57.600
No!

24:57.600 --> 25:04.320
Okay, there was a toy called...

25:04.320 --> 25:05.600
Who in here is 40?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.640
There was a toy in the 70s called...

25:10.640 --> 25:11.200
Okay, anyway.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.840
It is faster.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.480
It's faster.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.200
You can truck.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.160
You can fucking plays when you're skipping.

25:18.160 --> 25:18.400
Yeah.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.040
You got a meeting you're running late for,

25:21.040 --> 25:26.400
you see the train pull up, you walk, gone, missed it.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.440
Skip it, you run into the back of the train

25:29.440 --> 25:31.040
because you got in it so fast and hard.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.560
You maybe can't even stop.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.640
Yeah, then you pass the train.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.000
That train has to catch up to you.

25:38.000 --> 25:38.640
That's the problem.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.160
If you're of a certain age,

25:40.160 --> 25:43.200
the problem becomes stopping skipping because that don't...

25:43.200 --> 25:44.480
It doesn't look cute, folks.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.680
As an adult, the motion's to stop a skip.

25:49.680 --> 25:53.360
There's a lot of kinetic energy that you're having to work against.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.320
Then here's this.

25:54.320 --> 25:59.120
I think we can sell skipping as everybody's fast paced lifestyle on the go.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.920
Houston, especially like got to get to...

26:01.920 --> 26:03.440
Fourth largest city in America.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.640
Yeah, you got to skip around.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.360
I got to skip around.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.720
I got places to be.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.440
I got appointments.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.240
I've got to skip.

26:08.240 --> 26:08.640
But...

26:08.640 --> 26:10.480
Justin, what's your annual import X for?

26:12.480 --> 26:15.680
But stopping is embarrassing.

26:15.680 --> 26:20.320
So on the front of every business will be a little human stable

26:20.320 --> 26:21.760
that you can kind of just stop,

26:21.760 --> 26:25.040
kind of just stop like a human garage that you can kind of...

26:25.040 --> 26:27.040
You skip and you're outside and you're like, hey, hey, hey.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.960
And then you hit the human stable and you're like...

26:31.120 --> 26:34.000
And inside the stable is just one wall of a bounce house

26:34.000 --> 26:34.880
that you can run into.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.160
Run into and just fully stop.

26:36.160 --> 26:40.480
And now you're going to walk because you're in a bank now.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.720
And you're in a church.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.240
And this is a respectful place.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.120
You should not skip in front of Christ.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.040
You know they're going to find a way to charge you though.

26:51.040 --> 26:54.080
You're going to find a way to like skip, skip, skip.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.800
That'll be three dollars, please.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.400
Well, I mean, that's the problem is that adults tend to just ruin everything.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.640
And so I think if we all started skipping,

27:02.640 --> 27:04.160
eventually it would become competitive.

27:04.160 --> 27:04.640
Yeah.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.520
It would be a sweat.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.920
And then people would start marketing like skipping shoes.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.400
Yes.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.080
Special skipping equipment.

27:10.080 --> 27:10.720
Where can I buy it?

27:10.720 --> 27:11.680
Now I'm interested.

27:11.680 --> 27:12.160
Right.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.840
And then it's just like, where's the fun?

27:13.840 --> 27:15.680
I thought this was about the love of the sport.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.120
Wait, what about the skipping shoes?

27:17.120 --> 27:17.600
Take me back.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.480
Where'd you get them, Travis?

27:18.480 --> 27:19.120
Don't leave me hanging.

27:19.120 --> 27:19.680
Come on.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.200
I made them at home.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.880
I glued several other pairs of shoes together.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.080
Pieces of them, not just like shoes.

27:29.360 --> 27:34.400
You, I don't think you necessarily want skipping to be socially acceptable

27:34.400 --> 27:36.320
because I think that's what you like about it.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.560
Oh, that it's dirty.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.640
It's dirty and wrong.

27:40.640 --> 27:41.760
And you're skipping.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.120
You know what you're doing.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.640
You're making like this face like.

27:44.640 --> 27:55.360
If you're listening later, Griffin just made a face like he was skipping and getting away with it.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.920
But he's giving it kind of a, I'm a naughty boy face.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.120
Kind of a naughty face.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.680
Can I say something?

28:03.680 --> 28:06.480
Even just sort of bouncing up and down on my chair like that felt kind of good.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.040
Hey, guys.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.000
Hey, everybody.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.880
Can we just bounce for a second?

28:08.880 --> 28:10.400
Moving kind of feels nice.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.440
I don't see you bouncing.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.800
This has turned into a fucking Wiggles concert and we're done.

28:17.600 --> 28:21.600
Hey, I got a Yahoo here that was sent in by Nick Potter.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.240
Thank you, Nick.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.400
It's Yahoo Answers user Jenny.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.680
Thank God.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.680
Who asks, what can I do to make a trash can really smelly?

28:29.680 --> 28:30.560
That's right.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.800
The best shit about Yahoo's is not the questions.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.880
It is the like the accessories, the interjections around it.

28:44.880 --> 28:49.360
I have these obnoxious kids that play basketball every day slash evening right behind my townhouse

28:49.360 --> 28:50.960
and occasionally hit my home.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.880
I'm assuming with the basketball, it's not some way that they like keep score is by

28:54.880 --> 28:56.800
punching the shit out of your townhouse.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.240
Anyway, it's annoying as hell and I need to do something that will prevent them from

29:00.240 --> 29:01.040
playing basketball.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.280
I have a trash can that is right next to where these kids play basketball.

29:05.280 --> 29:08.720
So I figured I'd make my trash can unbearably smelly.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.600
Lol.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.280
What a weird use of lol.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.960
Like I am hatching an evil scheme.

29:16.080 --> 29:21.680
What a weird use of all your brain to generate this.

29:21.680 --> 29:30.480
If you said to your friend, hey, I love playing basketball here with you, but I'm starting

29:30.480 --> 29:35.760
to suspect that the person who owns the townhouse next to our basketball court is intentionally

29:35.760 --> 29:39.040
making their trash can more smelly to prevent us from playing.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.520
Your friends would lock you in prison.

29:42.480 --> 29:46.560
They would put you in mind jail for being so buck wild.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.760
That just makes this the perfect crime.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.120
It is a crime, yeah.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.080
I think it's just disrupting the peace or something.

29:54.080 --> 29:58.080
Okay, there's two things I want us to think about parameters that I think are very important.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.560
One, it is an outdoor area.

30:00.560 --> 30:00.720
Yeah.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.800
So the level of smell you will have to achieve.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.160
Holy shit.

30:04.160 --> 30:04.720
Rough.

30:04.720 --> 30:09.520
And two, the level of smell you will have to achieve so that some teens playing basketball

30:09.520 --> 30:12.480
will be like, wait, hold on, what is that?

30:13.200 --> 30:14.400
Well, that's the thing, Travis.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.360
They can't just be distracted by it.

30:18.320 --> 30:21.040
I don't know that I've ever been playing basketball.

30:21.920 --> 30:22.240
Period.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.920
And I could end the sentence pretty much.

30:23.920 --> 30:24.240
End the sentence, yeah.

30:24.240 --> 30:32.800
Yeah, I don't know that I've ever been playing basketball and smelled something that made

30:32.800 --> 30:34.560
me want to stop playing basketball.

30:35.120 --> 30:41.600
That is a wild connection to make, except for a pie on my neighbor's window sill.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.760
Okay, this person is going about it all wrong.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.680
Not smell bad, smell good.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.040
Smell good, far away.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.280
Yes, smell good, unplaceable.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.040
Make their homework smell very good.

30:51.040 --> 30:55.040
Or just like a similar, just kind of a scent where they're like, what is that?

30:55.040 --> 30:58.080
Well, you made it smell like their grandmother's attic.

30:58.080 --> 31:02.480
And they're having such strong sense memory they can't play basketball anymore because

31:02.480 --> 31:06.480
they're thinking about the beautiful times they had in grandma's attic looking at old

31:06.480 --> 31:07.120
photos.

31:07.120 --> 31:13.760
Thank God you found the world's only nostalgic teenagers to play basketball at your home.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.080
Here's an idea.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.360
We're not going to solve this one.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.560
No, I can solve it.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.600
Okay, I can solve it.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.400
Don't make the trash can more smelly.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.360
Put the trash can under the hoop.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.520
So they go for a nasty dunk.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.360
And then all of a sudden, there's coffee grinds all over the ding dang ball.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.080
Nobody wants to play and there's a bunch of peanut butter and lemon juice on their favorite

31:40.080 --> 31:41.760
basketball game over.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.400
I can't make nasty dunks with this nasty ball.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.480
This is too nasty for me.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.160
There's jelly all over it.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.280
Here's the...

31:49.280 --> 31:52.240
I didn't see that trash can there when I dunked it.

31:53.360 --> 31:57.760
You have to put it out there fast or put a Roomba on it that can automatically...

31:59.040 --> 32:02.240
Okay, that was going to be my point is that they could just move the garbage can.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.600
Not when there's a Roomba on it.

32:03.600 --> 32:04.080
Yeah.

32:05.280 --> 32:05.840
But...

32:05.840 --> 32:08.640
You know, don't program a Roomba for something so hateful.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.560
Don't program a Roomba to transport stink around.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.880
That's the opposite of what the Roomba wants.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.000
That's the opposite of what a Roomba's supposed to do.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.560
No, no, no.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.720
Where's a Roomba's programming?

32:20.720 --> 32:22.640
They're so near sentience, please.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.880
Just let them develop on their own.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.920
Don't teach them about evil.

32:27.920 --> 32:31.840
Even if there's a Roomba on the bottom of it, I think they could still move it like

32:31.840 --> 32:34.800
a hundred feet away and then they have a little bit of while to play basketball before the

32:34.800 --> 32:35.760
Roomba comes back.

32:35.760 --> 32:36.720
And that's an issue.

32:36.720 --> 32:41.840
What you have to do is go out there and say, oh, this game looks like fun.

32:41.840 --> 32:42.400
What's it called?

32:42.400 --> 32:43.520
Basketball?

32:43.520 --> 32:44.720
I would love to try playing it.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.280
By the way, you're very good at basketball and you're totally putting them on.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.040
Also, you stink like shit.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.120
You stink like dog shit.

32:57.840 --> 33:01.440
And you are going to be doing some deep coverage.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.240
In the paint.

33:04.240 --> 33:08.240
So in the paint, you are going to be technical fouling.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.200
You'll lose the game.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.840
But you'll win the day.

33:11.840 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, but they'll lose the game by which I mean not want to play it again.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.880
Well, at that point, why can't you just hustle them?

33:18.880 --> 33:21.120
Like if I win, you never play basketball here again.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.200
So that's nothing to do with smell, Justin.

33:23.200 --> 33:23.840
Oh, fair.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.920
Also, because we already did it like a hustling joke.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.360
I feel like in this episode, we already did one hustle.

33:29.360 --> 33:30.800
Do we have another question?

33:30.800 --> 33:31.840
Yeah, let me see.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.600
We're going to do audience questions, by the way.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.160
We're not taking.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.840
Not right now, but that's something we do.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.640
We do do that.

33:38.640 --> 33:42.400
We just wanted you to get very excited and then disappointed really fast.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.880
Griff, why don't you start another Yahoo?

33:47.920 --> 33:49.440
Go ahead and just start another Yahoo for me.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.720
It just popped up.

34:01.680 --> 34:02.560
This just popped up.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.040
Thank you for the hot in from HQ.

34:05.040 --> 34:08.720
The spooky lighting that matches the temperature of the lights

34:08.720 --> 34:12.000
that are currently giving us a nice deep tan.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.280
It's a haunted doll watch.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.880
This is a very good one.

34:18.880 --> 34:19.520
Haunted doll.

34:20.080 --> 34:20.800
Magical.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.920
Amazing power.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.880
Unique spirit.

34:22.880 --> 34:23.920
Powerful white lighter.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.560
It's so much so fast.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.480
Yeah, that's my favorite out of that whole thing.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.440
Unique spirit.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.160
Unique spirit.

34:30.160 --> 34:33.520
Not one of those bland, boring like nickel and dime spirits.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.840
A special one.

34:35.840 --> 34:40.400
This is one of the only haunted doll descriptions I've ever read where...

34:40.400 --> 34:41.920
This is directly from eBay, by the way.

34:41.920 --> 34:42.880
You can go buy this doll if you want.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.880
By the way, we did a haunted doll watch last night.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.160
Somebody bought the doll.

34:46.160 --> 34:49.520
Like immediately tweeted at us that they bought it.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.720
So that was a mistake on their part.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.160
This is the only one I've ever read where...

34:52.160 --> 34:53.840
Unless it works.

34:54.960 --> 34:55.840
Works?

34:55.840 --> 34:56.800
That's not the right word.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.000
Here is...

34:58.000 --> 35:03.280
This is the only one I've ever read that it seems more like song lyrics than a...

35:03.280 --> 35:04.880
Here is Sandy.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.000
She is a magical doll.

35:07.040 --> 35:07.680
Period.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.080
Is she...

35:08.080 --> 35:08.800
Hold on.

35:08.800 --> 35:09.840
Is she a magical doll or a haunted doll?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.120
Is she a magical doll or is she a haunted doll?

35:11.120 --> 35:12.880
Don't fucking get your mythology mixed up.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.320
Magical dolls are wonderful spiritual entities.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.440
Exclamation point.

35:18.000 --> 35:18.320
Okay.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.200
Sandy is somewhat of a white lighter slash dark spirit.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.560
Interesting, isn't it?

35:24.560 --> 35:26.880
How we only got white lighter in the headline

35:26.880 --> 35:30.000
and then we find out later she's kind of a dark spirit also.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.520
I hope you already clicked by it now.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.800
What does that mean?

35:33.520 --> 35:34.400
Oh, oh, oh.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.280
I can answer this.

35:35.280 --> 35:35.680
Nothing.

35:37.200 --> 35:41.840
It means she's not all negative energy, just very powerful.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.360
She isn't afraid to use the power.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.160
She's empowered.

35:44.160 --> 35:44.880
She's strong.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.000
She knows her place in the world.

35:46.000 --> 35:46.960
I love this doll.

35:46.960 --> 35:50.960
So she'll watch a marathon of like HGTV with you.

35:50.960 --> 35:51.120
Yes.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.120
But she might be a little snarky about it during.

35:53.120 --> 35:57.120
Right, so the TV is going to float off the entertainment center.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.800
She is more than a white lighter.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.400
She is an energetic spirit with boundless energy.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.800
She has been used in some dark magic.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.960
Just right when I'm ready to click.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.800
She remains a white lighter.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.320
See this like hot and cold.

36:14.320 --> 36:18.400
Yeah, of of complete dookie nonsense words.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.440
This is the next sentence.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.960
I'm going to read this verbatim.

36:22.960 --> 36:23.920
Sayances.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.160
Oh, she loves sayances.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.840
Don't get me started on sayances.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.400
Oh, this kid with sayances.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.160
Very next sentence follows it up.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.640
Crystal balls are another of her favorites.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.360
Okay, just keep those around.

36:43.360 --> 36:49.440
She telepathically has told that she has done some very dark questionable things.

36:50.240 --> 36:50.560
What?

36:50.560 --> 36:55.520
But through those experiences, she has acquired knowledge of magic

36:55.520 --> 36:57.360
through all of her previous owners.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.560
This has made her very powerful.

36:59.440 --> 37:02.960
She said that she only became a dark spirit when necessary.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.320
They pushed her into this.

37:05.120 --> 37:05.760
She didn't want.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.040
Have you seen Prison Break?

37:07.040 --> 37:07.600
Hold on.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.360
I haven't.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.560
Is it about a doll?

37:12.320 --> 37:16.000
I just let her tell me what she wants it to and she tells me a lot.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.360
She loves to telepathic conversations.

37:19.360 --> 37:22.800
She loves to telepathic conversations?

37:22.800 --> 37:26.160
The twinkle in her eyes show how willing she is to please.

37:26.960 --> 37:27.460
Sandy.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.760
Come on.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.760
It's a little kid.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.960
It's not.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.720
It's a dead little kid.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.760
It's not.

37:35.760 --> 37:39.200
Sandy has been used by some very powerful witches and warlocks.

37:39.200 --> 37:45.040
She's lived with witches, shamans, wizards, fortune tellers, warlocks, and sorcerers.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.080
And Adam Sandler.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.200
And Adam Sandler.

37:47.200 --> 37:51.840
And Adam Sandler, for a brief time, she lived with Channing Tatum in his beach house.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.640
She is sought after because she enhances their spells so they're very powerful.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.800
If she's sought after, why is she on eBay?

37:59.840 --> 38:00.340
Thank you.

38:01.120 --> 38:07.680
By the way, you can place a bid on good old Sandy for $11.99 currently.

38:09.680 --> 38:13.440
So if you're a warlock or a sorcerer, it's good news.

38:13.440 --> 38:18.400
Hey, it started at one penny, but there's a bunch of warlocks and fortune tellers just

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400
running it up one penny at a time.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.560
Okay, this one is a little perplexing for me.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.360
Oh, this is the first perplexing.

38:26.800 --> 38:31.040
She has been used by the very experienced in the magical realm, by those who value her

38:31.040 --> 38:31.600
many gifts.

38:31.600 --> 38:35.360
She has said telepathically, and she has many stories she can tell you.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.280
She's kind of a tailspinner, Sandy.

38:37.280 --> 38:37.760
Have we-

38:37.760 --> 38:38.560
As for-

38:38.560 --> 38:39.520
Hold on, hold on.

38:39.520 --> 38:46.080
As for mortals, only the very experienced or those who have some form of seventh sense

38:46.080 --> 38:47.120
are recommended for her.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.360
What's the seventh one?

38:49.360 --> 38:50.560
The seventh sense?

38:52.080 --> 38:54.400
We got- We found another one?

38:54.400 --> 38:56.320
I think that's taste supreme.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.240
I think it's- I think six is umami.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.000
Seventh is Spidey.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.400
Sandy is a white lighter connected to the other world.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.400
Jesus Christ, we get it.

39:10.400 --> 39:15.920
Something of a guardian who protects and guides witches, mortals, with magic gifts to protect

39:15.920 --> 39:18.480
and nurture them as their powers evolve.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.640
However, she is also dark Sandy.

39:22.480 --> 39:25.760
Will cast spells or put curses on those who have betrayed you.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.240
Which is she mostly though, eBay?

39:28.960 --> 39:32.480
She will make it her goal to even the score, okay?

39:32.480 --> 39:33.840
Holy shit.

39:33.840 --> 39:39.280
You will have to tell her when you think they have had enough, then she will stop.

39:39.840 --> 39:40.340
What?

39:41.120 --> 39:41.620
No!

39:43.120 --> 39:44.240
Are you kidding me?

39:45.440 --> 39:48.800
Who is looking at this like 11.99 though?

39:49.600 --> 39:50.640
Are you serious?

39:51.440 --> 39:52.400
Sandy, please.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.560
Sandy, they've had enough.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.120
We are-

39:55.120 --> 39:55.840
Have they?

39:55.840 --> 39:56.720
Have they?

39:56.720 --> 40:03.680
We are 15 paragraphs in and I still have no idea what this fucking doll looks like.

40:03.680 --> 40:04.240
eBay.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.160
Any kind of description?

40:06.160 --> 40:07.360
No, I can see the image.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.160
It's just like you've given me her biography.

40:10.160 --> 40:10.660
Right.

40:11.840 --> 40:12.800
Just a one sentence.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.480
The doll is also very good.

40:17.680 --> 40:21.840
She is very hyper and will transfer some of her energy to you.

40:21.840 --> 40:25.280
You will be able to feel it as it is electrifying and tingling.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.640
You will just need to tell her where to put that energy into.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.640
You make the decisions.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.320
You make the decisions.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.480
With her around, things start to get better.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.280
Good luck, happiness, financial, and well-being.

40:37.280 --> 40:37.780
Financial!

40:39.120 --> 40:44.400
She offers an open door for you to wish for what you want and see it come to you.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.360
She is very helpful with money too.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.880
Okay, now do you mean magical or is she like,

40:50.880 --> 40:53.760
Ooh, spent a lot on gas this month.

40:53.760 --> 40:54.260
She's-

40:54.260 --> 40:55.840
Have you diversified?

40:55.840 --> 40:59.200
She's helpful with money starting now.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.920
After you've bought the haunted doll.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.080
I really like the next line.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.600
This- Oh, okay.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.600
I hate to see her go.

41:08.320 --> 41:08.820
She has-

41:09.760 --> 41:12.240
But I love me some $12.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.360
I'm out of enemies to smite.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.720
She killed all my enemies.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.880
Even Brenda who was mean to me at euchre.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.920
That's- I made that up.

41:21.920 --> 41:22.960
I hate to see her go.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.440
She has brought me a small windfall of $400.

41:26.800 --> 41:27.300
$400.

41:27.300 --> 41:27.800
$400.

41:28.740 --> 41:29.240
$412.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.900
Just when I needed it the most.

41:32.900 --> 41:33.400
How?

41:35.140 --> 41:35.940
This is a bad-

41:36.500 --> 41:38.500
Okay, you have said-

41:38.500 --> 41:40.020
This doll is in your possession.

41:40.020 --> 41:42.980
You said this doll will make you good at financial.

41:42.980 --> 41:45.060
You said this doll made you $400.

41:45.780 --> 41:47.220
You're selling them for $12.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.900
You are still pretty bad at financial.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.540
All right, this is where this one starts to lose me.

41:55.540 --> 41:59.780
I haven't- I have enjoyed her immensely.

41:59.780 --> 42:05.620
She has told me telepathically not to get too attached to her as she is just visiting.

42:05.620 --> 42:06.820
I'm a rambler.

42:06.820 --> 42:09.140
Listen, I'm a loner, a rebel.

42:10.180 --> 42:16.580
Her owner, who is a witch, said Sandy told her telepathically it was time to go to her next owner

42:16.580 --> 42:19.060
who is waiting for her to let her go.

42:19.940 --> 42:21.060
Wait, what?

42:21.060 --> 42:23.060
So you're a broker at this point?

42:23.060 --> 42:25.700
You're selling the doll for a witch, you know?

42:26.580 --> 42:28.660
In the meantime, they gave you $400.

42:29.700 --> 42:32.100
Anyway, so that's a haunted doll watch.

42:32.100 --> 42:32.820
Good lord.

42:37.220 --> 42:42.660
You only have five days and 16 hours at this point, so you want to get on that.

42:42.660 --> 42:45.300
That one was like its own cinematic universe.

42:45.300 --> 42:51.700
Which I appreciate it.

42:59.300 --> 43:02.500
Hi everybody, it's- it's Griffin and Travis of The Present.

43:02.500 --> 43:03.380
Hi, hello!

43:04.420 --> 43:04.900
Hi!

43:04.900 --> 43:07.220
Didn't see you come in there, stranger.

43:07.220 --> 43:09.860
Ah, stranger, kick off your boots, stranger.

43:09.860 --> 43:12.100
Oh, nope, you got the stink feet.

43:12.100 --> 43:13.620
Oh, did you hear me razz them, Trav?

43:13.620 --> 43:15.140
Did you hear me razz our listeners?

43:15.140 --> 43:16.100
Got them.

43:16.100 --> 43:19.060
Yeah, that'll teach them for listening to our show.

43:19.060 --> 43:23.700
Justin's in the toilet again, and I'm sorry that that's what I say every time Justin's not here,

43:23.700 --> 43:25.700
but it's never not true.

43:25.700 --> 43:28.580
Yeah, I mean, statistically speaking.

43:28.580 --> 43:31.060
For sure, so thank you for listening to our Houston live show.

43:31.060 --> 43:35.620
Justin is on a toilet vacation this week, and so we miss him very much.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.260
We hope you enjoy our Houston show.

43:38.260 --> 43:41.620
One note before we forget, before we get into the money zone,

43:41.620 --> 43:47.140
uh, is that the next part you're gonna hear in the Houston show is actually- this is an older episode,

43:47.140 --> 43:50.900
uh, so this is before we did our new way of doing audience questions.

43:50.900 --> 43:56.980
Uh, they're still good, but I didn't want you to think that we'd stop this bold new innovation in

43:56.980 --> 43:59.540
question solicitation technology.

43:59.540 --> 44:05.220
Um, but yeah, that's- that's coming up soon, but first off, Travis is gonna tell us all about fucking Squarespace.

44:05.220 --> 44:09.460
I also want to say, real quick, before I get to fucking Squarespace, I want to talk about, real quick,

44:09.460 --> 44:14.580
thank you to everybody who came out to all of our, uh, book events for the Adventure Zone graphic novel,

44:14.580 --> 44:21.380
which is out now in, uh, fine bookstores, and you can find different places to order it online at theadventurezonecomic.com.

44:21.380 --> 44:24.820
Thank you to everybody who's bought it so far, and everyone who will buy it in the future,

44:24.820 --> 44:28.180
and I really appreciate everybody who came out to all the, uh, Comic-Con events.

44:28.180 --> 44:29.620
It was just lovely.

44:29.620 --> 44:31.620
So, let me tell you about Squarespace.

44:32.340 --> 44:34.100
Listen, I love Squarespace very much.

44:34.100 --> 44:37.300
I use it for a lot of projects, including macroshows.com.

44:37.300 --> 44:40.100
You can turn your cool ideas into a new website.

44:40.100 --> 44:41.220
That's the most wonderful thing.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.100
If you have a spontaneous website, boom, you hop on there.

44:44.100 --> 44:46.020
You can have it up in, like, 30 minutes.

44:46.020 --> 44:50.340
It's, like, take your idea, make it a website in, like, a half hour.

44:50.340 --> 44:53.460
Showcase your work, announce upcoming events or special projects.

44:53.460 --> 44:57.140
They have beautiful templates, uh, created by world-class designers,

44:57.140 --> 45:01.380
and they have an e-commerce functionality, so you can sell things online,

45:01.380 --> 45:05.380
and it's free and secure hosting, and there's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

45:05.380 --> 45:08.580
They have 24-7, uh, help desk,

45:08.580 --> 45:13.700
and you can find, like, you know, tutorial videos for anything you want to do.

45:13.700 --> 45:18.340
So, there's really nothing stopping you from having an amazing website online now.

45:18.340 --> 45:21.460
Yeah, but this e-commerce function has got me thinking, Trav.

45:21.460 --> 45:24.260
I think I'm gonna make the website to sell my hat.

45:25.300 --> 45:27.380
Okay, just the one hat?

45:27.380 --> 45:30.020
Yeah, you know that hat I have, and I've been looking to get rid of it for a while

45:30.020 --> 45:33.860
to raise some funds for a new, a different hat, a new hat.

45:33.860 --> 45:34.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:34.180 --> 45:37.540
So, uh, I'll get that up online and make sure to tweet the link out,

45:37.540 --> 45:40.980
and, um, someone buy my, someone buy my fucking hat.

45:40.980 --> 45:45.540
You know, I've got a lot of those, uh, I got a lot of movies in HD format,

45:45.540 --> 45:47.700
like, when you could buy the HD disc before Blu-ray.

45:47.700 --> 45:49.220
The HD DVD, yeah.

45:49.220 --> 45:51.460
Yeah, and when it was unclear which one it was gonna be,

45:51.460 --> 45:56.100
and I have about, let me do a quick check, uh, 475 HD DVDs.

45:56.100 --> 45:58.580
Yeah, they're all Patch Adams, too.

45:58.580 --> 46:00.740
Um, but where can I get Squarespace?

46:00.740 --> 46:04.020
Well, head to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial,

46:04.020 --> 46:07.780
and when you're ready to launch, use the offer code mybrother, all one word,

46:07.780 --> 46:11.140
to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

46:11.140 --> 46:15.460
That's squarespace.com slash mybrother, and enter the code mybrother, all one word.

46:15.460 --> 46:19.460
And if you use the promo code mybrother on, uh, buygriffinshat.biz, uh,

46:19.460 --> 46:23.700
the Squarespace website, uh, you will get, as a free sort of promotional item

46:23.700 --> 46:27.140
with the hat, 475 HD copies of Patch Adams.

46:27.140 --> 46:28.340
That is correct.

46:28.340 --> 46:30.020
I wanna tell you about stamps.com, too,

46:30.020 --> 46:35.060
cause they are, they have been sort of really very vital to me in this project

46:35.060 --> 46:41.460
of, uh, shipping 475 DVD, HD DVDs of Patch Adams, um, because what they do

46:41.460 --> 46:44.900
is they make it much easier to ship all the stuff that you wanna ship.

46:44.900 --> 46:47.940
Because these days, listen, you can get pretty much anything on demand,

46:47.940 --> 46:51.460
like our podcast, you listen whenever you want, when it's convenient for you.

46:51.460 --> 46:54.100
So why take trips to the post office to mail letters and packages

46:54.100 --> 46:58.100
when you can do all that stuff with postage on demand at stamps.com?

46:58.100 --> 47:00.580
They let you access all the amazing services of the post office

47:00.580 --> 47:02.980
right from your desk, 24-7.

47:02.980 --> 47:05.620
Buy and print official US postage for any letter, any package,

47:05.620 --> 47:07.460
using your own computer and printer.

47:07.460 --> 47:08.580
It's easy, come on.

47:09.140 --> 47:12.980
So stamps.com is very, very, uh, a very, very good service.

47:12.980 --> 47:16.980
I always get sort of, um, anxious whenever I have to leave the house for any reason.

47:16.980 --> 47:21.460
And so not, you know, losing one reason to leave the house

47:21.460 --> 47:24.420
with stamps.com is very valuable for me.

47:24.420 --> 47:30.900
And you can sort of share in my, uh, hermetic, is that the word, hermetic?

47:30.900 --> 47:31.460
Yeah, sure.

47:31.460 --> 47:32.660
Hermetic nature.

47:32.660 --> 47:35.300
If you use My Brother for this special offer,

47:35.300 --> 47:39.620
it includes $55 free postage, a digital scale, and a four-week trial.

47:39.620 --> 47:43.620
Um, I should say that's a code, My Brother, and don't use Travis or Justin.

47:43.620 --> 47:45.220
Yeah, yeah, please.

47:45.220 --> 47:48.100
But also don't wait, go to stamps.com and before you do anything else,

47:48.100 --> 47:50.340
you click on the radio microphone at the top of the home page

47:50.340 --> 47:54.580
and you type in My Brother, all one word, that's stamps.com, enter My Brother.

47:54.580 --> 47:57.060
Griffin, I've just had a terrible realization,

47:57.060 --> 48:01.700
because from time to time we'll make a goof about, like, some obscure movie title

48:01.700 --> 48:05.220
or weird format of something and then people will, like,

48:05.780 --> 48:08.420
bring it to us at live shows or, like, ship it to us.

48:08.420 --> 48:11.380
And I'm just picturing someone right now listening to this episode,

48:11.380 --> 48:15.780
looking to their right, seeing that HD DVD copy of Patch Addams and thinking,

48:15.780 --> 48:20.340
oh, finally, I can be freed from this curse and hand this off.

48:20.340 --> 48:21.140
Please do not.

48:21.140 --> 48:23.060
I've already got 475 of them.

48:23.060 --> 48:23.780
Oh, Jesus.

48:23.780 --> 48:28.340
What was the movie that somebody sent us a full box of VHS copies of?

48:28.340 --> 48:30.980
I believe it was, uh, You, Me, and Dupree?

48:31.780 --> 48:33.380
Ah, I don't think that was right.

48:33.380 --> 48:34.260
You don't think that's it?

48:34.260 --> 48:35.620
Was it Nutty Professor on VHS?

48:35.620 --> 48:37.460
I think it may have been Nutty Professor.

48:37.460 --> 48:39.220
Jesus, that was a long time ago,

48:39.220 --> 48:41.540
but it's exactly the kind of thing that you're talking about, Travis,

48:41.540 --> 48:43.460
and we should be more responsible.

48:43.460 --> 48:46.660
I just, I already have so many HD DVD copies of Patch Addams.

48:46.660 --> 48:48.980
Please don't send us Patch.

48:48.980 --> 48:50.420
You want to read this first Jumbotron?

48:50.420 --> 48:51.140
I do.

48:51.140 --> 48:53.140
It's for Andy, and it's from Sadie.

48:54.580 --> 48:55.860
And Sadie says,

48:55.860 --> 48:58.100
To my good, good husband, Andy.

48:58.100 --> 49:03.540
I hope this fills your heart with love and joy as we celebrate first one year of marriage.

49:03.540 --> 49:06.180
Our April 1st wedding was, in fact, no joke.

49:06.180 --> 49:07.460
Oh, that's good.

49:07.460 --> 49:10.580
But I know the rest of our lives will be filled with fun and adventures.

49:10.580 --> 49:13.140
Walter and Doug say they think they should vote.

49:13.140 --> 49:14.660
I assume those are dogs.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.900
Also, I'm a clam, you idiot.

49:16.900 --> 49:17.780
Thunder up.

49:17.780 --> 49:18.820
Always and forever.

49:18.820 --> 49:19.460
Love, Sadie.

49:19.460 --> 49:21.620
Now that was supposed to be for April 1st.

49:21.620 --> 49:23.380
April Fools, Andy.

49:23.380 --> 49:25.940
Your wedding message is three months, four months, whatever.

49:25.940 --> 49:28.020
He got you, sucker.

49:28.020 --> 49:28.580
Got you.

49:28.580 --> 49:29.700
What a good prank.

49:30.740 --> 49:34.740
Here's a message for Greg, and it's from Jeff Goldblum,

49:34.740 --> 49:37.060
big fan of the show, big supporter of our art.

49:37.060 --> 49:38.500
Jeff Goldblum says to Greg,

49:38.500 --> 49:40.340
Simply, soon.

49:40.340 --> 49:42.340
Soon.

49:42.420 --> 49:43.540
So Greg, look out.

49:43.540 --> 49:46.020
Jeff Goldblum has lots of sort of ways and means,

49:46.020 --> 49:49.780
lots of crafty sort of devious machinations.

49:49.780 --> 49:51.380
And the time's coming.

49:51.380 --> 49:52.500
And the time's coming.

49:52.500 --> 49:55.300
And he knows all your passwords and stuff.

49:55.300 --> 49:56.180
I'm so sorry.

49:57.380 --> 50:01.460
I'm so sorry that this is the last time I get to talk to Greg, but it's been great.

50:01.460 --> 50:02.660
Head on, Swivel Greg.

50:02.660 --> 50:03.940
Stiff up a lip.

50:03.940 --> 50:05.860
Sorry about your Goldblumening.

50:05.860 --> 50:06.900
Yes, it's happening.

50:06.900 --> 50:08.500
How about this final Jumbotron?

50:08.500 --> 50:09.300
Yes, I would love to.

50:09.300 --> 50:10.500
It's for Dan W.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.460
It's from Suzanne.

50:11.460 --> 50:16.020
Congratulations to Dan from Suzanne and her clones on getting your-

50:16.020 --> 50:16.520
Whoa.

50:17.780 --> 50:18.660
Whoa, okay.

50:18.660 --> 50:20.820
From Suzanne and her clones on getting your first-

50:20.820 --> 50:22.740
Did they all pay us for-

50:23.700 --> 50:24.900
I guess.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.860
For this message?

50:25.860 --> 50:29.620
Because I didn't know that that was sort of a benefit to clone technology.

50:29.620 --> 50:31.220
I thought it was just like more sheep.

50:32.020 --> 50:32.520
Okay.

50:33.380 --> 50:36.100
On getting your first real job at 36.

50:36.100 --> 50:38.180
Wow, that was a good streak, Dan.

50:38.180 --> 50:42.180
Hope you enjoy shooting lasers at brain tumors for many years to come.

50:42.180 --> 50:43.300
Yeah, fuck them up.

50:43.300 --> 50:44.900
Yeah, we're very proud.

50:44.900 --> 50:47.380
I hope you enjoy star foxing tumors-

50:47.380 --> 50:47.860
Hell yeah.

50:47.860 --> 50:49.060
For many years to come.

50:49.060 --> 50:54.900
We're very proud that you are so close to making all of second grade Dan's dreams come true.

50:54.900 --> 51:00.980
Love, Suzanne, Helen, Jane, and a daughter to be named later, or possibly already, if after March.

51:00.980 --> 51:01.780
Yup.

51:01.780 --> 51:04.260
Yup, probably a little bit after March.

51:04.260 --> 51:06.740
Is this the only job where you get to use-

51:06.740 --> 51:10.500
You know, killing lasers?

51:10.500 --> 51:12.580
Again, still, you know, bad stuff like brain tumors.

51:12.580 --> 51:16.500
But I can't think of too many other jobs where you get the, you know, laser technology.

51:17.860 --> 51:18.420
I don't know.

51:18.420 --> 51:19.700
I'm trying to think, I guess-

51:20.900 --> 51:23.780
I mean, there's like men in black, of course.

51:24.500 --> 51:27.540
Yeah, but there's hard to get a men in black job.

51:27.540 --> 51:28.900
Oh, tell me about it.

51:28.900 --> 51:30.100
Yeah, in this economy?

51:30.980 --> 51:31.860
So yeah, that's gonna be it.

51:31.860 --> 51:34.180
We're gonna hop back into the show.

51:34.180 --> 51:39.700
In case we don't say in the show, thank you to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of the theme song.

51:39.700 --> 51:42.740
It's the departure of the album, putting the days to bed.

51:42.740 --> 51:48.500
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com or just look at your local bookstores.

51:50.340 --> 51:51.460
What else, Griffin?

51:51.460 --> 51:52.740
Thanks to Maximum Fun.

51:52.740 --> 51:55.220
I'm pretty sure we cover all this in the live show.

51:55.220 --> 51:58.820
But just thank you all for supporting our stuff that we do.

51:58.820 --> 51:59.700
It really means a lot.

51:59.700 --> 52:08.500
I always get very sentimental after a tour like we just got back from that we get to live these very, very weird, cool lives.

52:08.500 --> 52:15.700
And that's 100% because you all have supported us for, you know, like nine years, going on nine years now.

52:15.700 --> 52:21.540
So we really appreciate y'all and we'll be back next week with a regular episode.

52:21.540 --> 52:24.420
You know, Griffin, real quick, you mentioned Maximum Fun.

52:24.420 --> 52:29.300
I just want to say, I got to spend a lot of time with the cast of Bubble this week at San Diego Comic Con.

52:29.300 --> 52:30.420
And I'm all caught up on it.

52:30.420 --> 52:32.740
And it is so, so very good.

52:32.740 --> 52:34.660
You should check it out on MaximumFun.org.

52:34.660 --> 52:35.780
Bubble, it's great.

52:36.580 --> 52:37.620
But that's it.

52:37.620 --> 52:39.780
Here's the rest of the episode and we'll be back next week.

52:39.780 --> 52:40.280
Bye.

52:42.740 --> 52:45.300
Are stacks of unread books taking over your apartment?

52:45.300 --> 52:48.100
Do you constantly miss your train stop because you're caught up in reading?

52:48.100 --> 52:49.140
I'm Bria Grant.

52:49.140 --> 52:50.420
And I'm Mallory O'Mara.

52:50.420 --> 52:51.540
We party hard.

52:51.540 --> 52:54.020
And by party hard, we mean read books.

52:54.020 --> 52:59.460
So join us every Thursday on Reading Glasses, a Maximum Fun podcast about reading and book culture.

52:59.460 --> 53:00.980
Get more out of your reading life.

53:00.980 --> 53:03.140
We'll help you conquer your to-be-read pile.

53:03.140 --> 53:04.340
Get out of that book slump.

53:04.340 --> 53:07.380
And squeeze more reading time into your busy day.

53:07.380 --> 53:09.460
Learn how to read better.

53:09.460 --> 53:10.420
Wow, that was good.

53:14.260 --> 53:16.420
We're going to do audience questions now.

53:16.980 --> 53:18.420
Some ground rules.

53:19.940 --> 53:20.500
No, Bummer's is a good one.

53:20.500 --> 53:21.460
You guys lay it out for them.

53:21.460 --> 53:24.180
I just got to check my socks.

53:24.180 --> 53:25.380
Justin's going to the bathroom.

53:25.380 --> 53:26.740
Justin's using the restroom.

53:27.540 --> 53:28.260
Okay.

53:28.260 --> 53:29.460
There's one right off stage.

53:29.460 --> 53:30.420
It's so convenient.

53:31.140 --> 53:32.100
Hello.

53:32.100 --> 53:32.820
My name's EJ.

53:32.820 --> 53:34.100
Hi, EJ.

53:34.100 --> 53:34.820
She, her, hers.

53:35.540 --> 53:38.340
My question is, I work for a mattress company.

53:41.380 --> 53:42.740
We've gotten in trouble in the past.

53:42.740 --> 53:43.780
Don't say which one.

53:44.820 --> 53:48.980
We've had two different times where somebody emails us the day after a live show like,

53:48.980 --> 53:50.260
can you delete it?

53:50.260 --> 53:50.820
No, not that.

53:50.820 --> 53:53.940
We just don't want you to get fired if you're like, anyway, they all stink.

53:53.940 --> 53:54.340
No, no, no.

53:54.340 --> 53:55.940
All the mattresses are full of farts.

53:56.500 --> 53:56.980
Not at all.

53:56.980 --> 54:00.580
This is a question about my customers, actually.

54:00.580 --> 54:02.180
All my customers are full of farts.

54:04.340 --> 54:05.540
I'm sure that's not EJ.

54:05.540 --> 54:06.100
One second.

54:06.900 --> 54:10.580
I have to say, this is a beautiful sort of symphonic space.

54:10.580 --> 54:11.380
And we went down.

54:11.380 --> 54:13.780
The green room is on a level called Musicians.

54:13.780 --> 54:18.020
And when I went and sat down on the couch, Griffin said, hey, Justin, how many chillist farts

54:18.020 --> 54:21.620
do you think are in that thing?

54:21.620 --> 54:22.900
My brother's funny.

54:22.900 --> 54:23.220
All right.

54:23.220 --> 54:23.780
Sorry, EJ.

54:23.780 --> 54:24.260
What we got?

54:26.020 --> 54:31.380
So a lot of folks will ask me kind of casually.

54:31.380 --> 54:33.060
I think most of them are probably joking.

54:33.060 --> 54:34.340
Most of my customers are pretty chill.

54:34.340 --> 54:38.660
But they'll ask me what beds are the best to kind of like bone down on.

54:39.300 --> 54:40.580
Strangers ask you this?

54:42.100 --> 54:45.860
And I don't want to get fired.

54:45.860 --> 54:46.260
Yeah.

54:46.260 --> 54:48.740
But it's a super inappropriate question.

54:48.740 --> 54:52.100
But I want to find out what's a good way to answer that question.

54:52.100 --> 54:52.580
OK.

54:52.580 --> 54:56.580
For a second there, I thought you were going to say, and I've let them know.

54:56.580 --> 54:57.460
There is an answer.

54:58.900 --> 54:59.700
OK.

54:59.700 --> 55:01.700
EJ, here's what I would do if I was you.

55:01.700 --> 55:03.380
Say, well, that all depends.

55:03.380 --> 55:06.100
Can you please stand on this bed and show me how you do it?

55:08.420 --> 55:10.820
And then you turn on a camera and leave the room.

55:10.820 --> 55:16.820
And it's Tom Brady who's come to have sex with that mattress.

55:17.380 --> 55:19.460
Travis, you've got to drop the Tom Brady.

55:19.460 --> 55:21.940
Tom Brady's going to have sex with that mattress.

55:21.940 --> 55:22.900
So here's what you do.

55:22.900 --> 55:25.860
The next time someone asks you that question, you say, what do you mean?

55:27.300 --> 55:30.980
And you just keep asking them to explain over and over again until they leave.

55:30.980 --> 55:31.780
So good.

55:32.900 --> 55:33.700
No, I'm sorry.

55:33.700 --> 55:35.060
I must be missing something.

55:35.060 --> 55:36.100
Bone down?

55:36.100 --> 55:36.820
What?

55:36.820 --> 55:37.860
Start from the beginning.

55:39.380 --> 55:39.620
OK.

55:39.620 --> 55:40.340
Here's your answer.

55:40.340 --> 55:41.380
You want a bed?

55:47.540 --> 55:48.660
Where you sleep?

55:52.260 --> 55:56.020
I think I think I think there is a correct answer.

55:56.020 --> 56:01.220
And I think to punish these fucking despicable people who would come in and ask a stranger

56:01.220 --> 56:04.580
this, you point them to the worst possible answer.

56:04.580 --> 56:06.100
Oh, you want the sex bed?

56:06.100 --> 56:09.540
It's the the nasty, rusty Springtron 2000.

56:09.540 --> 56:10.740
Why do we sell that one?

56:10.740 --> 56:11.220
They take that.

56:11.220 --> 56:12.100
Just for sex.

56:12.100 --> 56:15.860
They put that one on the box spring and they're like, all right, let's get busy.

56:17.060 --> 56:18.180
Spring shoots out.

56:18.180 --> 56:19.540
Stab, stab, stab.

56:19.540 --> 56:20.500
Oh, no.

56:20.500 --> 56:23.140
And you say, I guess you aren't doing it right now.

56:23.140 --> 56:24.340
You got to know how to handle it.

56:24.340 --> 56:26.820
If you weren't ready, high risk, high reward with the Springtron.

56:26.820 --> 56:28.340
You asked for the best.

56:28.340 --> 56:29.460
This is the best.

56:29.460 --> 56:30.100
Does that help?

56:30.660 --> 56:31.540
It helps a lot.

56:31.540 --> 56:32.580
Thank you so much.

56:32.580 --> 56:38.820
Hey, what's up?

56:39.620 --> 56:41.140
Hi, I'm Tom.

56:41.140 --> 56:42.100
They them.

56:42.100 --> 56:42.580
Hi, Tom.

56:42.580 --> 56:43.460
Hi, Tom.

56:43.460 --> 56:44.420
So thanks, Paul.

56:48.420 --> 56:48.980
Jesus.

56:52.100 --> 56:55.140
Do not touch me with that rag after his touch these two other boys.

56:57.860 --> 57:00.100
So I'm dating two people.

57:00.100 --> 57:02.180
Um, not in like a cheating way.

57:02.180 --> 57:02.740
Okay.

57:02.740 --> 57:04.420
We're in like a, hold on.

57:04.420 --> 57:08.740
You were pretty like, what would it have been funnier though if we've been like, oh, what?

57:11.940 --> 57:16.900
No, it would have been funnier if two people in this audience has stood up and it's been like, what?

57:16.900 --> 57:21.140
And they were sitting with an NPC between them.

57:21.140 --> 57:23.540
No, my girlfriend is here.

57:23.540 --> 57:24.020
Okay.

57:24.020 --> 57:24.580
Hello.

57:24.580 --> 57:25.140
Yeah.

57:25.140 --> 57:28.820
Um, so we're in like a polyamorous triad.

57:28.820 --> 57:29.300
Okay.

57:29.300 --> 57:30.820
Um, yeah.

57:31.780 --> 57:32.740
Um, so.

57:32.740 --> 57:34.180
Drawing on our expertise.

57:34.180 --> 57:34.660
Go ahead.

57:36.660 --> 57:37.460
Uh, so.

57:38.420 --> 57:41.700
Triad sounds so much fucking cooler than couple, by the way.

57:41.700 --> 57:42.260
Yeah.

57:42.260 --> 57:44.180
Yeah, that's the, that's the word for it.

57:44.180 --> 57:45.940
That's fucking dope.

57:45.940 --> 57:46.260
Yeah.

57:46.260 --> 57:47.060
Okay, sorry, go ahead.

57:47.060 --> 57:50.100
Um, so this is a healthy, happy relationship.

57:50.100 --> 57:52.260
I'm, I've been with my girlfriend for two years.

57:53.380 --> 57:56.980
She, I, and our boyfriend are going on two years as well.

57:56.980 --> 57:57.300
Okay.

57:57.300 --> 58:00.580
Um, my family's cool with me being gay and all that.

58:00.580 --> 58:06.980
But, um, how do I explain to people that I am dating two people and it's not like cheating?

58:06.980 --> 58:09.300
And also how do I explain it's not a sex thing?

58:11.380 --> 58:11.700
Yeah.

58:12.580 --> 58:13.700
I imagine the same people.

58:15.140 --> 58:18.820
I imagine the same people who would ask you about that are the same people who would walk

58:18.820 --> 58:25.060
into a fucking mattress store and ask for tons of sex mattresses.

58:25.060 --> 58:30.740
We need to start installing traps in the ground every 20 fucking feet.

58:30.740 --> 58:34.500
And anytime anybody says some bullshit, you're just like, hey, can you follow me over here

58:34.500 --> 58:35.460
for a second?

58:35.460 --> 58:40.260
If you're, if you're cool, you get an app on your phone and you press the button and

58:40.260 --> 58:42.260
one of the every 20 foot traps falls.

58:42.260 --> 58:47.780
And if you hear somebody say, say, which ones the sex mattresses are for sex, bam.

58:50.180 --> 58:52.900
And there's not spikes in the pip, it's hard to get out.

58:52.900 --> 58:54.180
And eventually they'll learn.

58:54.180 --> 58:57.140
There's not spikes in the pip, it's just like everyone that they respect at the bottom

58:57.140 --> 58:58.180
going, what did you say?

59:00.420 --> 59:01.220
What got you here?

59:01.220 --> 59:03.300
Man, shit's bad right now.

59:03.300 --> 59:03.940
Can I ask you a question?

59:03.940 --> 59:04.660
Serious question.

59:04.660 --> 59:10.420
When you, if you encounter a person that is like unfamiliar or like unexposed to people

59:10.420 --> 59:14.580
who are living a polyamorous lifestyle, are you the sort of person who like minds sort

59:14.580 --> 59:17.300
of taking the time to educate the people or are you like fucking over it?

59:17.300 --> 59:19.300
Um, I don't mind really.

59:19.300 --> 59:25.860
Like, um, I remember I started telling people when I was in like high school and honestly

59:25.860 --> 59:29.060
a lot of people there were just like, you're dating two people?

59:29.060 --> 59:29.700
That's sick.

59:31.940 --> 59:34.500
That's like the other response you don't want.

59:34.500 --> 59:39.540
Like, it's actually flattering because like the idea that like their minds are blown

59:39.540 --> 59:42.420
like, whoa, two of them?

59:42.420 --> 59:43.380
You can have two of them?

59:44.580 --> 59:48.260
That I get the same thing when I tell people I just ordered two dinners at a restaurant.

59:48.260 --> 59:49.940
He always does.

59:49.940 --> 59:50.820
Every day this tour.

59:50.820 --> 59:52.500
And by the way, it's not equating these things.

59:52.500 --> 59:53.700
No, it's not the same.

59:53.700 --> 59:55.220
I just get the same response.

59:55.780 --> 59:56.500
You got two?

59:57.460 --> 59:57.860
I did.

59:58.740 --> 01:00:01.460
Except usually it's a lot more concerned when they say it to me.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.220
You got two?

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.020
You got two?

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.060
Oh no.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.020
What's the split?

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:10.580
If you do not mind me asking, what's the split like these days when you tell somebody like

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.660
50-50 like, what?

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.260
To like people who are like, oh, I get it.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:20.260
Well, I think it depends on who I'm talking to because when it's people my own age, a

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:23.860
lot of the time they'll either get it or if they don't know, they'll just be like, oh,

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:24.660
that's a thing.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:33.300
But compared to like, if I started to tell my 50-year-old Republican Christian mother.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.020
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.860
Then it doesn't, then it doesn't.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.820
You didn't finish the sentence, but it doesn't go good, I bet.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:45.860
But it's like, it really does depend on who I'm talking to.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:52.420
And so when I get the vibe from someone that like, maybe their views don't match with

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.700
mine, I'll try to avoid it.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:00.820
Well, I'll tell you the kind of the same thing about the mattress question of like, if...

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.020
So here's some other things Travis is going to compare your relationship to.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:04.500
No, no, no.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:08.500
Two dinners, Tom Brady having sex with a mattress.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.780
Oh, yeah, and I forgot to say my boyfriend is a body pillow.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.260
Oh, good.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:17.700
Okay, well, I mean, specifically, if someone makes like weird sex joke comments about it,

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:21.700
that the impetus is then not on you to make that okay.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.260
Yes.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.060
That's that.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.780
So like, if somebody says something, I think you're in a position to go, what do you mean

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:26.260
by that?

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.900
They're putting you in a position where you have to explain yourself.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:29.460
No, no, no.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.660
You don't have to do that.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:31.860
Make them explain themselves.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.700
I have a position you can put them in though.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:41.700
I have a better position you can put them in, and it is 10 feet immediately below where

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.900
they were just standing.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.100
I'm just saying, it doesn't have to be in every city.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.420
We can get these in San Francisco, Houston.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.580
You would only have to establish 100 trap doors across America, but no one knows where

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.060
they are.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:57.540
Yes.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.900
And then the threat is there.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.620
The threat is there.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.620
All right, Tom, you understand how deep...

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:06.580
Again, I've never had a challenge like this in my life, so we're kind of out of our lane

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.780
right now, but I would say this.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:13.780
The fact that you're willing to take the time to explain your lifestyle, which is such a

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:20.180
personal thing, is deeply unfair that you have to do that, but super cool of you because

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.820
what I would keep in mind when you're doing that is that you're making it literally 100%

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.180
easier for the next person behind you and over and over and over again.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.180
It's a shame, but I think it's so rad that you're doing it because you're making life

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.460
better for everybody else.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:39.940
So thank you from me, a straight white dude that has to explain nothing other than his

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.900
t-shirt choices.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:45.140
But thank you, Tom, for your work.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.580
Should I just...

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:51.380
If they ask if it's a sex thing, should I just be like, what is sex?

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:51.620
Yes.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:52.820
Yes, exactly.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.660
I think that's going to get us out of a lot of situations.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.620
A lot of jams.

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:58.740
Explain to me, what is a sex?

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.020
What is in detail?

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.700
Birds, bees, what do those have to...

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.580
Are these two things having sex with each other?

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.860
Take it back to the beginning.

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.820
What kind of horrible cross reads are we getting from birds and bees?

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.460
Why are the birds and the bees...

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.060
No wonder the bees are disappearing.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.300
They're getting crushed by the bird or a bee.

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.620
Anyway, Tom, does that help?

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.580
Did I switch those?

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.620
I did, didn't I?

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.220
Birds aren't disappearing, bees are.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.740
But have we checked on birds?

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.140
Birds, everybody, bird count.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:26.740
Tom, does that help?

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:27.940
Yes, it does.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:28.180
Thank you.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:28.740
Okay, cool.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.860
Imagine my surprise.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:30.340
Thank you.

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.340
All right, we're going to do one more.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.780
I'm Lindsay.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.660
Hi, Lindsay.

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.580
My question revolves around my dog.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.420
So my husband and I rescued a dog when we moved down to Houston.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.100
From like a burning building or like a...

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.020
I mean, we moved and then pretty immediately adopted her.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.380
So I say it was pretty important part.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:55.940
Yeah, for sure.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:58.340
Or would you say maybe your dog rescued you?

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.100
I like that, Travis.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.220
From a burning building?

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.380
Yeah, I think that's fair to say.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:11.140
But I have a thing where I really, really like to buy toys for her

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:14.340
because she very much appreciates them because she had a hard life before.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:19.140
The problem is she has probably over a hundred toys by now.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.980
Is that bad?

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:27.140
So I guess my question is, what is a socially acceptable amount of toys for me to purchase for my dog?

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:32.900
I have a very important follow-up question that I think will determine the long answer, the short answer.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.100
And it's very important.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.100
Is she a good girl?

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.100
Of course she is.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.100
Yes, she is.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.620
She is the best.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.140
All right, we'll come back to that.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.140
Hey.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:47.140
Hi.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.140
I'm going to make this very clear up front because it's important to the story.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.140
My actual name is Joe.

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.140
Okay.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:57.140
Now, I started working at a new job here in Houston about six months ago.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:01.140
And before I started working there and moved here, I got an email from my boss saying,

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:05.140
hey, just want to let you know there's been two other Joes before you,

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:21.140
and it's been kind of iffy with them when they left, so we're going to call you Max from now on.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:25.140
At first, this was okay.

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:27.140
Until they got to the point...

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:29.140
Was it?

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.140
New city, new me, man.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.140
I had to start new.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.140
We're in a fugue state.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:41.140
This is how Tyler Durden spawns.

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.140
It gets a little better.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.140
So I started working...

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.140
They stopped.

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.140
Bye.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.140
Anyways, I just wanted to brag about this cool thing that happened.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:57.140
I started working and like the paperwork started getting drawn up for like payroll and like healthcare and all that stuff.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:01.140
And I was walking with my boss and one of the people from HR and they were like, yeah, this is Max, blah, blah, blah.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:05.140
And they're like, oh, Max, we're going to start doing all your paperwork and your social security stuff.

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:09.140
And I was like, no, that won't match up with the number that's on the card.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.140
But then it did. What's going on?

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.140
What?

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:19.140
It's even gotten to the point where the CEO didn't even know my real name at the Christmas party when he called me.

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.140
Well, why would they?

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:23.140
He knew me by Max.

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.140
Yeah.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:29.140
Listen, hey, folks, if somebody tries to call you by a name that you don't want to be called, tell them no.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.140
I will be Joe.

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.140
I will be Joe today and all other days for I am Joe.

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.140
That's the thing.

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.140
If they're like, hey, we had some bad experiences with Joe.

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.140
You say, I can fix that.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.140
This is a new Joe.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.140
Another thing you could say.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.140
There's a new Joe in town.

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.140
Another thing you could say is if they say, we don't want to call you Joe because we've had bad Joes before.

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:53.140
You could say a very reasonable thing, which is what the fuck are you talking about?

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.140
Well, wait, they told me.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.140
No, no, no.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.140
That's nothing.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.140
Yo, Joe Max, you're in way too deep.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:05.140
You're buying them bullshit now.

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.140
This is fucking nothing.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:13.140
This, by the way, is a con this business is running on you where they have had a fake account set up in the name of Max whatever.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.140
You're taking the fall.

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.140
Yeah, dude.

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.140
No question.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.140
They're cooking the books under your name and they're like, we're going to call you Max from now on so they can pin it on you.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:23.140
You've got to Shawshank your way out of there.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.140
Take those books with you.

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:29.140
If you walk in tomorrow, there's going to be a big sign up front that says Max's place.

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.140
All legal inquiries, please, to Max.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.140
It's his place.

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.140
Does that help?

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.140
We didn't say anything.

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.140
Quit that fucking job.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.140
But you know what?

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.140
Max, you having the strange courage.

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.140
Joe!

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.140
You made it worse.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.140
Not like this.

01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:55.140
Joe, there's no excuse for what I've just done.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:01.140
It's very hot up here and as you can see, I'm sorry, Joe.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:05.140
And isn't that what we're here for?

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.140
You didn't say anything.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.140
Joe, does that help?

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.140
Yes.

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.140
Go in tomorrow and quit.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.140
No!

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.140
It's been six months I just moved here from Virginia.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.140
I've got it.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:25.140
Next time someone calls you Max, say, oh, it's actually pronounced Joe.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.140
The M-A-X is silent.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.140
Yeah.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.140
Keep that going for a while.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.140
Joe's invisible.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.140
Does that help Joe set us free to say yes?

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.140
Joe, tomorrow's Monday.

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.140
Take your name back, Joe.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:49.140
100 toys for one extremely good dog sounds like the perfect number to me.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.140
Right.

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.140
Are they small toys, big toys?

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.140
Are you talking about little Tonka trucks?

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:59.140
No, mostly stuffed animals like Tigger or Stitch.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:03.140
How do you get 100 continuously functioning toys in your house that don't get destroyed?

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.140
She does not tear apart toys.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.140
Oh, she is a good girl.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.140
What does she do with them?

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.140
She nibbles on them.

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:13.140
She what?

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.140
She nibbles on them.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.140
You got any pics?

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.140
Yeah.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.140
Just tweet them at us later.

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.140
Do you have room for one more toy?

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.140
Say that again.

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.140
Do you have room for one more toy?

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.140
I don't have my wallet.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.140
I thought you were going to volunteer.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.140
No, it just sounds like a good dog.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.140
I want to do something nice.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:39.140
What you could do is take some of the older toys and give them to dogs that need them.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:43.140
The thing about that is what you like and I get it because I have a three-year-old.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.140
It is the same thing.

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.140
No question.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:53.140
I get a new toy and she is so excited to see it and she is down for 15 minutes and it is on the next thing.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:59.140
Then you take that to Goodwill, give that toy to them and then you can get more toys and not feel guilty because you have plenty of space.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.140
That is a great idea.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.140
Whoa.

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.140
We got one at the buzzer.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:07.140
Swish.

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.140
Does that help?

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.140
Very much so.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.140
All right.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.140
First, thank you, Jones Hall.

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.140
Yes.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:19.140
You are amazing.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.140
Thank you, Houston.

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:23.140
Thank you, Bayou City.

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.140
Thank you, Clutch City.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.140
Thank you, Space City.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.140
Thank you, Magnolia City, which is not used as much anymore, but it is a historical one.

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.140
Look into it.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.140
Can we get a big thank you for Paul Sabourin?

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.140
Thank you, Paul.

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.140
How about a big thank you for...

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.140
Well, hold on.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:43.140
Paul Sabourin has a band called Paul and Storm, which you should look up.

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.140
Yes.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.140
Paulandstorm.livejournal.com.

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.140
You can hear all of their tracks.

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.140
Thank you to Schmanners for their opening act performance.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:53.140
Listen to that running gag.

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.140
If you Google Paul and Storm, you will find their music.

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.140
Here is what you got to understand.

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.140
A running gag between live shows on a tour doesn't work.

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.140
It is different people.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:05.140
I just thought they would laugh because it is so irreverent.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.140
Thank you to...

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.140
I am assuming Paulandstorm.com. Paul, is that right?

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.140
Yep.

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.140
Thank you to Schmanners.

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.140
Yes.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.140
Thank you to our daddy.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.140
Thank you, daddy.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:25.140
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song as a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.140
Very good.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:31.140
Thank you to Max Fun for having us and thank you for donating to the Max Fun Drive.

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:33.140
Thank you.

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:39.140
Anything else before we wrap up this Texas-sized tour, which is to say three shows.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:45.140
Two cities, three shows, Texas style.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:47.140
Four different naps just for me.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:55.140
We thank you all for coming, but I do want to say, I am assuming there is at least a few people who decided to come just because we whined so much about people not coming to this show.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.140
Because you thought it would mean something to us and I just wanted to say you were right.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.140
Thank you.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.140
Thank you so much for doing that.

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.140
It is very sweet of you.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:09.140
And to the folks who bought tickets on the minute that they became available.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.140
You are all very important to us.

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:17.140
You are all important to us in God's eyes.

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.140
What?

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.140
Here is a final yahoo.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.140
It was sent in by Bill Morrison.

01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:25.140
It was sent in by Bill Morrison.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.140
Thank you Bill.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.140
It is from yahoo answers user.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.140
Jones Nate asks.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.140
What?

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.140
Jones Nate?

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.140
Jones Nate asks.

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:39.140
It is their name.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:43.140
What was the name of the book about the giant hero dog?

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:45.140
Not Clifford!

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.140
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.140
I am Travis McElroy.

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.140
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:12:53.140 --> 01:13:21.140
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:27.140
The news today is terrible.

01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:31.140
So why not forget about it while listening to Jonah Radio with Cash Hartzell.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.140
Hey everybody.

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.140
Featuring Neil Mahoney.

01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.140
Also me.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.140
This is a podcast where we play music submitted by listeners.

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:45.140
We hang out, we listen to new tunes and we take submissions at JonahRadio at gmail.com.

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:47.140
Come and check us out.

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.140
We are here anyway.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.140
We will be here.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.140
I hope this one goes.
