00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.360
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the

00:47.360 --> 00:51.840
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

00:51.840 --> 00:56.080
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.160
Justin, excuse me, everybody. I apologize for that, doing that right into the microphone.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.240
I usually have better technique than that, but can you blame me? I've got Scoob fever.

01:06.960 --> 01:13.360
Oh, God, these problems don't seem to be real until they affect someone that you care about.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.920
And then it's time to really sound the alarm bells and get out there.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.920
No sooner had we pretty much wrapped up the coronavirus thing.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.880
At this point, it's we're on the tail end of it, aren't we?

01:24.880 --> 01:28.880
Where it's wrapping up. This is like we're in the credit sequence for sure.

01:30.960 --> 01:38.640
Just as coronavirus finally gets wrapped up, now our family has been stricken with,

01:39.760 --> 01:44.640
well, just one member of our family has been stricken with a case of Scoob fever.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.520
Oh, it's hitting me hard. And let me tell you the symptoms. One,

01:47.520 --> 01:55.440
gotta need to have to sort of want to watch Scoob all day. Number two, I sneeze and it makes me do

01:55.440 --> 02:04.480
sound like Scooby-Doo or Scrappy-Doo, depending on the time of day. Number three, an itch,

02:05.200 --> 02:11.520
a constant all body itch all over, but especially in my button privates.

02:11.520 --> 02:18.160
I'll be honest with you, it's mostly the one to watch Scoob all day 24-7. Travis,

02:18.160 --> 02:23.200
you had a question about my condition. Well, more comment, really.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.960
I would say the bitter irony here is that Griffin has been afflicted with this malady,

02:30.960 --> 02:38.880
but I actually just before we started recording got my test results back and I seem to be immune.

02:38.880 --> 02:45.200
Oh, wow. So you think it's very rare that they're going to study me.

02:45.200 --> 02:50.560
You think you did, maybe you did have Scoob fever and now you do have the antibodies built up. And

02:50.560 --> 02:54.560
I don't know how that would happen. Maybe you saw a preview for it before Detective Pikachu

02:54.560 --> 02:59.680
and you were like, I'm going to see that. You may have actually vaccinated yourself

02:59.680 --> 03:07.040
with an inert, some of the inert virus antibodies. I watched a lot of a pup named Scooby-Doo

03:07.040 --> 03:14.160
and the doctors are theorizing that that contains some of the dead Scoob virus.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.880
Well, and you fucked Jabberjaw, didn't you, Travis?

03:16.880 --> 03:22.960
Well, you fucked Jabberjaw, the cartoon shark from the Hanna-Barbera era.

03:22.960 --> 03:29.440
Griffin, I made love with Jabberjaw, please. No, you made love to Grape Ape.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.160
I would never, that's terrifying.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.280
Fuck, kill, marry Jabberjaw, Grape Ape and Dick Dastardly.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.680
I can't fuck Jabberjaw.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.360
You would fuck Jabberjaw because you have fucked Jabberjaw. We've covered this.

03:43.920 --> 03:49.120
I think I'd marry Grape Ape. He seems like a provider.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.840
And you know why? Because I really want to kill Dick Dastardly.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.640
Once and for all.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.440
Someone needs to.

03:55.440 --> 04:01.280
We can't really talk about our feelings about the Scoob film

04:01.280 --> 04:07.280
because our careers have taken so many twists at this point

04:07.920 --> 04:13.200
that I have a not insignificant statistical chance of being in a room with people

04:13.200 --> 04:18.480
that worked on this film at this point. So I can't actually talk that much about it.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.160
But I will say one thing in the movie that is,

04:22.160 --> 04:29.360
is that we meet the gang when they're kids and when Shaggy adopts Scooby,

04:29.360 --> 04:38.800
he gives him a collar with the SD on it and he says, Scooby says, I'll never take it off.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.240
Scooby's talking a lot in this one, by the way. I'm not loving it.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.520
But he swears he'll never take it off.

04:45.520 --> 04:49.760
There is a plot point another hour into the film, which is 10 years later,

04:49.760 --> 04:54.400
where much is made, much ballyhoo is made of the fact that Scoob is,

04:54.400 --> 04:57.520
in fact, taking off the collar for the first time.

04:57.520 --> 05:01.120
Hey, Shaggy, I don't think that's okay.

05:01.120 --> 05:01.760
Yeah.

05:01.760 --> 05:06.720
Just from a hygiene standpoint, I don't think that's great dog maintenance, I would say.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.160
You gotta take that off from time.

05:08.160 --> 05:13.200
You gotta do a deep sort of grout cleaning under there.

05:13.200 --> 05:13.760
Get in there.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.280
Just really get in there.

05:15.280 --> 05:21.920
Now, boys, this is just a, let's just discuss the facts of Scoob.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.560
I have not seen it.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.120
All right.

05:23.120 --> 05:23.440
Okay.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.320
You both have.

05:24.320 --> 05:24.720
Yeah.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.040
I'm looking at-

05:25.040 --> 05:26.000
Stellar cast.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.040
Is that what you're about to ask?

05:27.040 --> 05:27.280
Yeah, I am.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.880
The cast is fucking stellar.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.440
I'm looking at the IMDb cast list now.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.960
Will Forte, Mark Wahlberg.

05:32.960 --> 05:33.600
Oh, I know.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.160
There goes my quiz show that I was about to do with you, Travis.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.040
Let me ball it up.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.080
Sorry.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.040
Put it in the trash.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.280
This is amazing Zac Efron, Gina Rodriguez.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.200
You fucking know Justin loves Mark Wahlberg.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.680
It's his first animated film, according to IMDb.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.360
But here is my question.

05:49.360 --> 05:49.760
Yeah.

05:49.760 --> 05:54.240
Among the stellar cast is a listing for Simon Cowell as Simon Cowell.

05:55.040 --> 06:02.400
So do they finally, does someone finally do a send up of Simon Cowell and his whole like,

06:02.400 --> 06:05.280
I don't think I like your performance, darling.

06:06.400 --> 06:11.520
Travis, if I was to tell you that the action of the film,

06:11.520 --> 06:17.280
the impetus of the action of the film is that Simon Cowell wants to invest in Mystery Inc.

06:17.280 --> 06:23.520
But not if Shaggy and Scooby are attached, then you would think I am kidding you.

06:23.520 --> 06:27.840
But no, that is the actual impetus of the action in the film.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.760
They are looking to take on investors.

06:29.760 --> 06:30.720
Oh boy.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.640
Simon Cowell is interested, but does not trust Scooby and Shaggy.

06:34.640 --> 06:39.040
I hate to disagree with you, Juice, but I would say the driving force behind the film

06:39.040 --> 06:44.720
is the fact that Dick dastardly wants to open a portal to hell so he can kill Satan and become Satan.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.600
So these are all real facts about Scoob.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.920
Gotta watch this fucking movie, Trav.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.440
You're gonna catch the thief.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.560
Let's, can we do a question?

06:52.560 --> 06:56.240
Hey, let's talk about, okay, Travis, one more thing I will say.

06:56.240 --> 06:56.480
Okay.

06:56.480 --> 07:02.000
Of the Mystery Inc. gang, which one do you think gets trapped in literal hell,

07:02.800 --> 07:06.080
sacrificing his soul for all eternity in this film?

07:06.720 --> 07:07.040
Huh?

07:07.040 --> 07:11.120
Who makes the decision to sacrifice their soul for all eternity?

07:11.120 --> 07:17.520
You know, it seems to me like Shaggy would be the most sacrificial lamb of the gang.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.040
So go on.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.000
I'm gonna say Shaggy.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.440
Interesting.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.840
I can't answer that, but here's what I will say.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.200
It's not Scooby.

07:27.760 --> 07:35.840
And the problem I have with that is as one of the gang does this act of locking themselves in hell

07:35.840 --> 07:43.360
forever so Scooby doesn't have to, and as Sidney pointed out so astutely as we watched the film,

07:44.160 --> 07:47.440
Scooby is 10 years old at this point.

07:47.440 --> 07:47.680
Yeah.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.600
And a dog.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.040
So it is, and the gang is in there like late teens.

07:57.040 --> 07:57.440
Yeah.

07:57.440 --> 07:57.760
Sure.

07:58.560 --> 07:58.800
Yeah.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.960
I mean, that's grim, but come on, folks.

08:02.960 --> 08:07.040
And he is a larger breed as a Great Dane, 10 is a long life.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.640
Yeah, you hate to talk about that.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.480
It's getting a little real in the studio.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.160
You hate to talk about it.

08:12.880 --> 08:13.600
All right, let's move on.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.400
But you would think, is there a point in the discussion, Justin,

08:16.400 --> 08:19.440
when they're maybe debating who will lock themselves in hell?

08:19.440 --> 08:24.240
And does anybody, and I'm looking at Daphne here, say he is a dog.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.240
He's an old, big breed.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.040
Let's-

08:27.040 --> 08:32.880
I don't know that maybe his soul is as important as our human soul.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.840
It's like a quarter of a human soul, I know.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.400
But we can, you know, the devil's not too discerning.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.040
Juice, read that first question maybe.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.720
Hello, brothers.

08:42.720 --> 08:43.040
Hello.

08:43.680 --> 08:46.000
I've gotten into beekeeping and I love to spread the word about

08:46.000 --> 08:48.400
saving these lovely ladies and what people can do to help.

08:49.200 --> 08:53.360
The problem is I'm often patronized and called cute and adorable

08:53.360 --> 08:54.640
when I tell my new friends.

08:54.640 --> 09:00.000
Just seeing what I do as a quirky trait and not taking me or my hobby seriously.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.520
How can I make people understand and take my passion of saving the bees seriously

09:03.520 --> 09:07.680
or make beekeeping seem cooler and saving the bees badass?

09:07.680 --> 09:09.040
Thank you for your time.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.440
Beekeeper Blues in Texas.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.920
Let's get down to bee-sness.

09:14.560 --> 09:14.880
Fuck.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.440
I think that it should be-

09:19.440 --> 09:22.720
I think it would be easy to carry around like one pamphlet

09:23.280 --> 09:26.960
that is like why we needs beads.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.640
Uh-huh.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.440
And hand those out to people when they laugh at you and they're like,

09:31.440 --> 09:32.080
bees aren't-

09:32.080 --> 09:35.920
Anybody who says bees aren't important right now isn't paying attention.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.120
Now, I will admit, I don't really know exactly why bees are important,

09:39.120 --> 09:40.080
but I think it's because they-

09:41.520 --> 09:43.040
It's something about the circle of life.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.880
Like bears eat honey and we need the bears to kill-

09:46.880 --> 09:48.960
To keep the coyote population in check.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.200
Yep.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.840
Something, something, something.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.840
The coyotes keep the bees in check.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.720
That's the cycle.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.120
That's- It's more of a triangle of life.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.880
It's just bees, bears, and coyote.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.240
So that is-

10:02.240 --> 10:06.000
Man, I feel like I've never looked at somebody covered in bees in a beekeeping suit

10:06.000 --> 10:10.240
like surrounded by these like delightful, venomous insects

10:10.240 --> 10:11.840
and been like, that's cute.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.840
It's always been like, wow, that's-

10:13.840 --> 10:15.440
They're doing a scary thing, huh?

10:15.440 --> 10:16.080
They're brave.

10:16.080 --> 10:16.880
I think it's more-

10:17.440 --> 10:21.280
I think it's more of like, if you say like, we need to save the bees,

10:21.280 --> 10:24.640
people see that and like, oh, that's cute, right?

10:24.640 --> 10:26.800
But I think that the thing is, I think we can all agree,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.800
and we're just on three gonna say it, in cinema,

10:31.360 --> 10:34.240
the coolest, we need to go save somebody

10:34.240 --> 10:37.040
and we're gonna prep for it seen in any movie.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.080
What's the movie, guys?

10:38.080 --> 10:38.880
One, two, three.

10:40.080 --> 10:40.800
The Matrix.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.640
Independence Matrix.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.440
Sorry, there's a lag.

10:43.440 --> 10:43.920
The Matrix.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.120
I said it at the same time as you.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.200
They get all those cool shelves of guns.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.560
They go flying past them.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.600
They get the big bag.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.080
It's cool.

10:50.080 --> 10:50.640
It's cool.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.160
Maybe more one of those moments,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.720
if you meet a new friend, you kick open the door

10:54.720 --> 10:56.800
and you come in, you've got one of those things

10:56.800 --> 10:59.360
that beekeepers use that sprays smoke

10:59.360 --> 11:01.040
to make the bees sleepy.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.680
And you bust in the door and you flip up your mask and like,

11:03.680 --> 11:05.040
it's trying to save the bee!

11:05.040 --> 11:07.440
And you make it seem a lot more urgent.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.160
That's good.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.760
Saving the bees is not a passive action that we can take.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.320
It is, in fact, an active action

11:16.320 --> 11:18.320
that somewhere there's a bee in trouble

11:18.320 --> 11:21.200
and you need to go save that bee.

11:21.200 --> 11:21.840
One bee?

11:21.840 --> 11:22.560
Just one bee?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.520
Well, you start with one bee, Griffin.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.040
Listen, if you could save,

11:27.040 --> 11:29.760
if you go out there today and you could save just one bee.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.120
I wouldn't, probably.

11:31.120 --> 11:31.760
It's not enough.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.240
Oh.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.920
No, and listen, I don't want to make it sound

11:33.920 --> 11:35.920
like I don't love these bees and value them

11:35.920 --> 11:37.840
and hate coyotes and I'm scared of them.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.800
So I need these bees.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.000
Like, I recognize that.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.160
But one bee?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.280
How many bees do you think you need to save

11:45.280 --> 11:46.880
for it to be worth it, to be like a good day?

11:46.880 --> 11:47.760
How far am I going?

11:47.760 --> 11:50.080
Am I going like out in the street, out in my front?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.400
Like, I don't want to break that quar.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.920
So like, if it's just out in my front yard,

11:56.480 --> 11:58.720
yeah, I'd probably do one bee for my front yard.

11:58.720 --> 11:59.680
You'd do one bee?

11:59.680 --> 11:59.840
Yeah.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.440
But if it's not going to feel like a full day,

12:01.440 --> 12:04.880
would you be like, I'm going to go to bed early today?

12:04.880 --> 12:06.160
I wouldn't go to bed.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.000
It's fucking 11, 54 a.m.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I wouldn't go outside, save one bee and be like,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.240
time to call it.

12:12.240 --> 12:12.560
No.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.440
Well, that's what I was asking.

12:13.440 --> 12:17.840
But what if you save like 1,000 bees in the next 10 minutes?

12:18.480 --> 12:19.600
Can I say something though?

12:20.320 --> 12:20.960
Yeah.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.600
I don't think I want to save 1,000 bees either.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.760
Because I love bees and I want to save them.

12:25.760 --> 12:30.400
And I want them to be like cool and spreading flower juice

12:30.400 --> 12:31.600
and all that stuff.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.440
But I don't want 1,000 bees near me and uncontained.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.280
Like, if I was a beekeeper and I had a little hive

12:37.280 --> 12:39.920
or one of those cool boxes, like, cool.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.800
1,000 bees love it.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.440
But like, I don't necessarily know I want 1,000 bees

12:43.440 --> 12:44.080
in my neighborhood.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.840
I would want to spread them out.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.080
Well, do you think that bee smoker gas

12:48.080 --> 12:49.440
would get you fucked up?

12:49.440 --> 12:49.920
Oh, yeah.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.160
I mean, that's what it does to bees, right?

12:53.280 --> 12:54.880
Yeah, it smokes them out.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.080
Yeah, it smokes them out.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.360
Do you think your friends might get into it

12:59.360 --> 13:04.000
if you also smoke them out while you smoked your bees out?

13:04.000 --> 13:04.720
You bombed it.

13:05.440 --> 13:09.760
Yeah, let's get faded with our black and yellow friends here.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.760
And we'll listen to some Blind Melon.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.080
Loving this, Travis.

13:14.080 --> 13:14.800
Good.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.280
Good, Travis.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.080
Good, Travis.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.960
Everybody give Travis the award now.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.680
Travis, there should be a certificate printing out

13:21.680 --> 13:22.880
from your computer.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.000
And Travis, we got all the listeners to sign it

13:26.000 --> 13:27.120
for your good book.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.040
There's only five names on here.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.520
Yeah, they all stopped listening after that joke

13:31.520 --> 13:33.280
because they figured that was the series finale.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.480
Oh, okay, yeah.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.520
Let me ask you guys this.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.880
Let me posit something to you.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.360
The only ones left are just writing fan fiction

13:39.360 --> 13:42.080
extended universe My Brother, My Brother and Me episodes.

13:42.080 --> 13:46.320
Someone walks up to you observing six foot quarantine,

13:46.320 --> 13:48.080
of course, and says,

13:48.080 --> 13:51.360
hey, I'm on my way to go kill a thousand bees.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.360
And if you let me do that, I'll give you a hundred dollar bill.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.480
Would you let them?

13:56.480 --> 13:57.360
No, no, no.

13:58.240 --> 13:58.560
Okay.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.440
No, cause I could sell a hundred bees on the internet

14:01.440 --> 14:02.880
for more or a thousand bees on the internet

14:02.880 --> 14:04.000
for more than a hundred bucks.

14:04.000 --> 14:04.480
You know what I mean?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.960
They're not giving you the thousand bees, Griffin.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
They're just telling you somewhere in the world,

14:08.960 --> 14:11.200
they knew where a thousand bees were

14:11.200 --> 14:13.360
and they were gonna go take them out.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.400
Yeah, no, I would ask them where the thousand bees are

14:16.400 --> 14:17.760
and then I would push them down

14:17.760 --> 14:20.320
and run much faster than them to capture the bees myself.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.520
And then I could sell them on the internet

14:21.520 --> 14:22.640
for more than a hundred dollars.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.880
See, it was a trick.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.000
There were no bees.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.440
This was like a what would you do kind of situation.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.840
Okay, well, John Quinones, you now know what I would do

14:33.840 --> 14:36.480
is I would push them so fiercely over

14:36.480 --> 14:38.880
so that I could sell these thousand bees on the internet.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.080
But if you had just taken the bees and not the money,

14:42.080 --> 14:43.840
I was gonna give you a thousand dollars.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.320
The fuck am I gonna do with a thousand bees?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.520
Like in my life.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.920
You're not gonna have the bees, Griffin.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.600
There were no bees.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.960
The bees were a ruse to see if you were a good person.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.720
Hey Griff, can I have some of your bees?

14:56.720 --> 14:57.360
How many do you want?

14:57.360 --> 14:57.860
Jesus.

14:58.480 --> 14:58.640
What?

14:58.640 --> 14:59.680
Travis, you're not a part,

14:59.680 --> 15:01.520
if this is the energy you're gonna bring,

15:01.520 --> 15:04.560
Trav, you're not invited to my bee distribution party,

15:04.560 --> 15:05.680
my bee Tupperware party.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.960
Justin, how many bees you need, bud?

15:08.720 --> 15:10.800
17 should cover me just for right now.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.360
17, huh?

15:12.080 --> 15:14.000
We talking normalies?

15:14.000 --> 15:14.560
We talking drones?

15:14.560 --> 15:15.360
I want choice cuts.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.400
I want choice cuts.

15:16.400 --> 15:19.600
Okay, but do we want drones or workers or warriors or,

15:19.600 --> 15:20.560
I'm not giving you my queen.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.040
Like that's-

15:21.040 --> 15:22.400
I'm not trying to get all your queen.

15:22.400 --> 15:22.880
No, no, no.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.040
But like, do you want my drones or my warriors or my-

15:25.040 --> 15:28.560
Just, if you could give me three wizards, four druids,

15:29.280 --> 15:31.520
and the rest just like barbarians or whatever.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.960
Now, do you want, if you want,

15:32.960 --> 15:35.760
I can do, if you kick that price up a little bit,

15:35.760 --> 15:36.560
we haven't talked price,

15:36.560 --> 15:38.400
but I know if you kick it up a little bit,

15:38.400 --> 15:40.000
you will afford a stud.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I do have one stud bee, and this one-

15:42.720 --> 15:43.680
What's his name?

15:43.680 --> 15:45.680
Cause I'm actually kind of superstitious.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.720
His name is Chester Big Sting,

15:48.720 --> 15:51.840
and this dude fucks like it's his job,

15:51.840 --> 15:58.000
and he can get the, I guess, make the queen's eggs grow faster

15:58.000 --> 15:59.120
or make more of them.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.640
Hey Griffin, sorry to interrupt.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.880
Whatever Justin offers you for Chester Big Sting,

16:02.880 --> 16:03.920
I'll double it.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.080
Well, it would feel weird to sell Chester Big Sting

16:06.080 --> 16:09.120
by himself without a bunch of other sort of bees

16:09.120 --> 16:10.720
that you can really lay the pipe on.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.000
I'll take 60 of your bees.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.560
60 and Chester Big Sting?

16:14.560 --> 16:15.200
Yeah.

16:15.200 --> 16:15.760
Travis, that's like-

16:15.760 --> 16:16.880
Name your price.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.160
That's like 12 bucks, man.

16:18.960 --> 16:19.520
Oh shit.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.040
Will you take 11?

16:23.440 --> 16:24.960
Yeah, yeah, I'll take 11.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.760
I can't believe you're letting him salt my deal

16:28.320 --> 16:30.320
after he was foolish enough

16:30.320 --> 16:31.680
to let these bees get away in the first place.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.560
I didn't realize it was a seller's market, Justin.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.600
Justin, the joke's on him.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.880
I'm just going to send them to him

16:36.880 --> 16:39.920
in one big sort of manila envelope.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.640
There's no way these bees are going to survive that trip, man.

16:43.440 --> 16:47.280
Do you guys want a yahoo?

16:48.160 --> 16:49.360
It was a honeypot.

16:49.360 --> 16:49.920
That's funny.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.880
Justin, check your printer.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.960
Everybody's getting certificates, baby.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.920
You know what's weird is it actually,

16:57.920 --> 17:00.640
my printer is actually functioning right now.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.200
It's actually operating, and I don't know why

17:03.200 --> 17:06.080
because it doesn't really work.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.280
It's not plugged in.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.160
It's not plugged in.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.000
No, it is plugged in.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.360
It's just no one ever prints anything.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.960
But for some reason, there's something printing.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.000
Why is my wife printing behind my back?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.600
That is what I need to know right now.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.840
Or have my kids learn to print off YouTube.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.240
I think it is for printing out YouTube flip books.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.520
They're probably just printing out

17:23.520 --> 17:25.360
really rude comments about you.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.280
See you later, cyan.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.960
Oh, my fucking cyan magenta is gone.

17:31.920 --> 17:32.480
How come it's-

17:32.480 --> 17:33.760
Hey, printer manufacturers,

17:33.760 --> 17:35.280
can we just call it blue and yellow?

17:35.920 --> 17:36.400
Thank you.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.560
Well, I mean, yellow is the other one.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.120
And red.

17:39.120 --> 17:39.600
Yellow is the other one.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.800
I think that's kind of fucked up.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.960
That cyan and magenta get to be these special,

17:42.960 --> 17:44.880
but it's not like and goldenrod.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.600
So this hasn't been funny for a little while.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.400
So let's do a yahoo.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.760
This one was sent in by Mike,

17:49.760 --> 17:51.680
and it's an anonymous yahoo answers user

17:51.680 --> 17:57.360
who I'm going to call boom shkadoow asks,

17:57.360 --> 17:59.760
why is Mono Lisa so popular?

17:59.760 --> 18:00.960
My nephew could paint it.

18:02.160 --> 18:02.400
Huh?

18:03.280 --> 18:06.880
No one's ever talked so much about Mono Lisa.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.520
Just one of them.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.320
Just the one, not stereo Lisa.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.240
I prefer stereo Lisa myself.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.760
I got in there before you did.

18:15.760 --> 18:22.240
So that one's going to be tricky to edit, that joke.

18:22.240 --> 18:26.880
But it is just a painting of a sort of like

18:28.080 --> 18:30.080
somewhat pleased lady,

18:30.720 --> 18:32.560
just kind of sitting on a chair.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.840
And what's in the background of Mono-

18:33.840 --> 18:36.560
Without looking, what's in the background of Mono Lisa?

18:36.560 --> 18:37.760
A field?

18:37.760 --> 18:38.720
I want to say it's a field.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.000
Justin, I hear you typing.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.720
Somehow, no, I'm not typing about that.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.000
I'm doing other work.

18:44.000 --> 18:44.480
Oh, cool.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.880
Cool, then let's stop doing the fucking question.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.320
And Justin, you unpack what kind of work

18:48.320 --> 18:49.440
you're doing right now, bud.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.520
You work on that spec script for young Sheldon

18:51.520 --> 18:53.440
that you've been talking about for so long?

18:53.440 --> 18:56.240
No, one of my kids has diarrhea and I was just-

18:56.240 --> 18:58.640
You were working on the diarrhea via your computer?

18:58.640 --> 19:01.680
You were typing into your science application

19:01.680 --> 19:03.600
trying to find a cure for diarrhea finally.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.080
He did and he cracked it.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.200
You were punching code into your diarrhea fixing app

19:09.200 --> 19:12.240
and it was updating the algorithms.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.160
It's like a city, right?

19:14.160 --> 19:15.280
We're all guessing, right?

19:15.280 --> 19:17.760
I feel like I want to say like columns on a hill.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.520
I want to say it's a garden seen through

19:20.720 --> 19:22.880
like an alabaster window.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.360
I'm going to look.

19:23.360 --> 19:23.840
Can we all guess?

19:23.840 --> 19:24.960
I'm going to look, yeah.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.680
Now let's look.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.120
Fuck, you know what?

19:29.120 --> 19:29.760
What?

19:29.760 --> 19:30.800
It's a map.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.360
It's a map?

19:31.360 --> 19:31.680
Yeah.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.280
Oh, it's a secret map.

19:33.280 --> 19:33.680
Hold up.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.560
A secret map.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.520
Griffin, are you not seeing this?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.120
Hold the fucking phone.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.320
Travis, what are you seeing in the map?

19:40.320 --> 19:45.440
I see there's a pathway, there's a mountain in the back across the river.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.600
Yes, absolutely.

19:47.600 --> 19:51.920
Okay, and you see the eagle there with the three arrows in its claw.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.200
Wait, what are those talons?

19:53.200 --> 19:54.640
Yeah, yeah.

19:54.640 --> 19:55.840
Griff, what do you see?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.520
Travis, what else?

19:57.520 --> 20:01.120
Oh, down here in the corner, it does say X equals three.

20:01.120 --> 20:01.520
I don't know.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.320
X equals three.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.920
Griff, are you seeing anything on your map?

20:03.920 --> 20:04.960
Oh, yeah, man.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.080
Mine is a funny mystery.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.000
There's a bridge.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.880
No, fuck.

20:10.880 --> 20:11.680
No, I'm not seeing that.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.320
You don't see the bridge.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.200
No bridge.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.640
Travis, you don't see a bridge, do you?

20:14.640 --> 20:15.840
No, I see a wormhole.

20:16.400 --> 20:16.960
No, Griff.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.400
Yeah, okay, I got the wormhole.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.280
I got the wormhole.

20:19.280 --> 20:19.840
Griff, do you...

20:20.480 --> 20:21.280
Griff, are you seeing anything else in there?

20:21.280 --> 20:22.880
Yeah, I see a really silly clue.

20:23.680 --> 20:23.920
No.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.120
No, I don't have that on mine.

20:29.120 --> 20:29.680
I have the...

20:29.680 --> 20:31.760
Travis, I'm seeing your wormhole for sure.

20:31.760 --> 20:32.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.200
Oh my god, I'm in it.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.000
And the X equals three.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.320
Okay, yeah, I see you.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.360
I'm walking down the road.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.080
I'm moving.

20:38.960 --> 20:39.520
I see you.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.560
Griffin, do you see yourself?

20:40.560 --> 20:41.680
Mona Lisa's a GIF.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.360
Griffin, do you see yourself?

20:43.360 --> 20:45.360
I don't know.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.080
You're on there.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.520
You're actually very prominent.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.160
You're doing jumping jacks and you look really cool doing it.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, jumping jacks, looking cool.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.720
So I'm moving the...

20:53.440 --> 20:56.720
I didn't know that Mona Lisa had movement.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.440
Okay.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.080
Yeah, the one I'm looking at is moving.

21:00.080 --> 21:00.560
That's why it's so famous.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.200
Griff, do you see any other things that could be clues on the map?

21:03.200 --> 21:05.680
I want to make sure you have the right map that Travis and I have found.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.400
I see a calendar and I know everybody says...

21:08.400 --> 21:09.280
No, no, no, no, no.

21:09.280 --> 21:09.600
There's no...

21:09.600 --> 21:11.680
Oh man, I sure would like to play along in this bit.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.520
I have funny jokes too, but I guess I'll...

21:16.320 --> 21:17.280
You gotta keep...

21:17.280 --> 21:20.160
I just want you to find the right map because Travis and I are on it.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.280
We're finding this map.

21:21.280 --> 21:21.600
Right, right.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.760
Oh, I wasn't looking at the right Mona Lisa.

21:25.760 --> 21:26.240
I think...

21:26.240 --> 21:28.560
Okay, now I see all the great shit you guys have been talking about.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.880
The eagle, the wormhole, all that stuff.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.480
Okay, good.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.000
The Kathy cartoon.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.200
Yeah, the calendar that says 9-11 on it.

21:37.200 --> 21:37.920
Whoa, hold on.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.560
I still don't see the calendar.

21:42.560 --> 21:47.840
Oh no, actually now I see the calendar, but it does say 9-11-2002, so well.

21:47.840 --> 21:51.280
Okay, that's when Shrek 3 came out.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.560
So maybe we've got...

21:52.560 --> 21:52.880
Is that true?

21:52.880 --> 21:56.640
Oh wait, was Mona Lisa just like native advertising for Shrek 3?

21:58.000 --> 21:58.960
Anything's possible.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.760
This painting, I do feel like...

22:03.760 --> 22:04.480
It's fine.

22:04.480 --> 22:09.280
You guys are the only ones with a nephew because of my powerful seed.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.920
I do feel like he could take a swing at this though,

22:13.920 --> 22:17.600
because it is just a lady sitting in front of this incredible map.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.520
And not even like the full lady, and legs are the hardest part.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.600
That's true, legs and feet are super tough.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.880
Hands are like, a chump could draw these hands.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.200
The legs are in the sequel.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.400
It's hanging below.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.040
Yeah.

22:31.040 --> 22:31.840
That sounds cool.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.600
Yeah, it's funny.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.480
It's funny to think about.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.920
The background is really pretty,

22:35.920 --> 22:40.320
and it kind of looks like Mona Lisa got in the way of a really cool background he was painting.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.040
Can you please move, please?

22:43.040 --> 22:43.760
She was like, no, I just got comfortable.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.360
I'm painting this beautiful garden.

22:46.160 --> 22:50.400
Or maybe there's like a horse there in the middle, and he sucks ass at horses.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.320
Like I never could do a horse.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.200
So if you could please stand there, perfect, yes.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.440
Absolutely.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.040
Here's another question.

22:59.040 --> 23:02.400
At a bonfire at a friend's house last summer,

23:02.400 --> 23:05.920
I noticed that one of the beach towels they had laid out on the chairs

23:05.920 --> 23:08.720
eerily resembled a beach towel my family used to own.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.600
I can't get it out of my head that it's the same towel.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.960
Is there any way I can try to reclaim the towel,

23:14.960 --> 23:18.480
or even ask about the towel without sounding like a towel obsessed creep?

23:19.040 --> 23:21.280
Maybe she stole it from me when we were 10,

23:21.280 --> 23:24.240
or maybe her mom got it at Costco or whatever.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.480
But it's a good towel, and I want it back.

23:26.480 --> 23:31.280
And if she did steal it, is there an expiration date on towel theft?

23:31.920 --> 23:35.600
I think they probably don't mean expiration date.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.680
That's not the legal term, I think.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.200
Statue of limitations.

23:39.200 --> 23:45.440
I was going to arrest you for murder, but it does say best by 10-22-2019.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.320
Ah, dang.

23:46.320 --> 23:50.240
Beach towel burgled in BC, British Columbia.

23:50.240 --> 23:50.740
Yep.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.200
The thing is, is there is a line-

23:53.200 --> 23:54.240
Beautiful country up there.

23:54.240 --> 24:00.880
A line of questions here that if you went even one step too far,

24:00.880 --> 24:03.600
you're going to seem like a bonkers person.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.400
Yeah, I would say one step too far is the literal

24:07.200 --> 24:10.320
first step you might take in trying to retrieve this towel

24:10.320 --> 24:11.920
that you think your family used to own.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.440
That's true, because even if you said,

24:13.440 --> 24:15.760
that's a great towel, and they're just like,

24:15.760 --> 24:19.040
this is like an old ratty towel that we've had for 10 years.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.160
What are you talking about?

24:20.800 --> 24:22.720
Yeah, there's lots of great towels out there.

24:22.720 --> 24:26.000
And if you hit me up on my Twitter DMs,

24:26.000 --> 24:30.160
I'll send you on your way towards Towel City.

24:30.160 --> 24:35.760
But maybe this towel has deep emotional significance.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.080
Yeah, that was my fear as well.

24:38.080 --> 24:44.320
I remember having this when I saw an old picture from a friend's house,

24:44.960 --> 24:50.720
and they had this blanket on a couch in the background

24:50.720 --> 24:59.120
that was a brown and tannish sort of very intimidating large tiger design.

24:59.120 --> 25:02.480
And then I remembered like, hey, that's my fucking blanket.

25:03.040 --> 25:08.320
And then I realized that this blanket was actually a very common blanket.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.400
I'm hoping I'm sending people down a well right now.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.280
I did just Google it.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.880
It's the Biederlach blanket.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.040
They are a company who made all kinds of just sort of big cat designs.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.680
And we also had a bear, I believe.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.280
Yeah, probably from the same company.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.960
And I remember seeing that and I had like a full like panic.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.080
Like, what the fuck?

25:28.080 --> 25:31.440
Did you steal our incredible tiger blanket without realizing like,

25:32.160 --> 25:34.480
nah, there was a period where lots of people thought like,

25:34.480 --> 25:36.880
you know what would go really well with my living room?

25:36.880 --> 25:39.200
A very large intimidating jungle cat.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.960
So that's possibly what has happened here as well.

25:42.960 --> 25:51.760
So here in our home, all of our towels are on some scale of like white, gray, dark gray,

25:51.760 --> 25:53.200
that kind of thing, right?

25:53.200 --> 25:58.720
There's this one towel that is a different size than any other towel we have.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.840
And it's a dark blue.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.160
And neither Teresa nor I know where it came from.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.160
And the only thing-

26:06.160 --> 26:06.720
That's a problem.

26:06.720 --> 26:11.440
Yeah, the only thing I can assume is that somebody came to visit our home

26:11.440 --> 26:15.440
and brought their own towel and left it?

26:16.160 --> 26:16.480
Guys.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.040
Yes.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.520
I can't with these fucking tiger blankets.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.720
I'm looking at this.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.760
Guys, I want you to go on this trip with me.

26:25.760 --> 26:26.880
And this is a visual trip,

26:26.880 --> 26:31.680
but maybe we can just sort of like explain it to the squad at home.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.960
Just like, these are big ass blankets.

26:34.960 --> 26:35.280
We're talking-

26:35.280 --> 26:36.640
Give me the username one more time.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.120
The manufacturer.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.240
Biederlack, B-I-E-D-E-R-L-A-C-K.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.280
These are blankets that we have multiple of in our house.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.960
And I think lots of people did too.

26:47.600 --> 26:54.320
And these are the biggest, most noble, most proud, most strong jungle cats

26:54.320 --> 26:55.920
that your mind could possibly-

26:55.920 --> 26:59.040
Imagine the most proud and noble jungle cat you could possibly-

26:59.040 --> 27:02.720
No, this big blanket that I guess we would wrap ourselves up in

27:02.720 --> 27:09.200
to feel the big cat's strength was such a common thing.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.560
These big, powerful, powerful kitties.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.920
I'm now torn looking at it.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.960
So I want you guys to weigh in.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.880
There's two that seem very familiar to me.

27:16.880 --> 27:21.920
And one is kind of like a tiger's, it's like the tiger's head.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.040
It's like a bust of the tiger.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.880
It's just the bust of the tiger, yes.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.960
That reminds me a lot of like the Cave of Wonders from Aladdin.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.440
That's very much the energy he's putting out.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.000
And then there's also one where the tiger,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.800
it looks like they're kind of walking towards the viewer.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.360
Like they're about to fuck you up.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.960
And maybe they're really surprised you're there.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.000
Oh, they look so-

27:40.000 --> 27:42.320
Their eyes are wide and they're about to fuck you up.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.640
So let's put that on the couch in the den.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.800
Their mouth is kind of going, uh.

27:47.680 --> 27:53.200
So let's put that in the little boy's bedroom to scare him so terribly.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.280
Or maybe that was it.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.400
I'm afraid of zombies because we just played a scary video game.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.400
Well, get under the tiger blanket.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.640
No undead creep is going to try and get you

28:02.640 --> 28:04.720
when this big powerful jungle cat's on you.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.160
Is that the one we had though?

28:06.160 --> 28:07.600
Which one is the one we had?

28:08.160 --> 28:11.200
It doesn't, that part doesn't matter.

28:11.200 --> 28:16.960
All that matters is that now all I want is a huge sinewy beast.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.880
They did do horse blankets as well,

28:18.880 --> 28:22.640
which I also specifically remember, I believe the one of two.

28:23.600 --> 28:28.960
Is this the Rosetta Stone for like the entire, our entire sort of deal?

28:28.960 --> 28:32.320
It might be, oh no, that was the one we had.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.960
It was a, it looks like a mom and a colt.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.480
I'm going to order one of these.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.280
I'm going to buy one of these powerful blankets.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.680
Yeah, these are fucking so inspiring.

28:39.680 --> 28:40.800
So anyway-

28:40.800 --> 28:48.000
Do you think it was our mom or our dad who saw the blanket with a tiger on it?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.960
They're like, hey honey, this fucking wolf.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.880
Kind of really seems like a dad move.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.880
It seems like a dad move, but I don't know dad to be like a tiger.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.800
Or a blanket man.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.080
But mom's whole style was more like a country kitchen

29:02.080 --> 29:03.520
and here's like some red apples.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.000
You know what?

29:04.880 --> 29:07.120
We got to get him on the horn.

29:07.840 --> 29:08.400
We got to figure this out.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.160
Yeah, let's call dad about this big blanket.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.200
I'm going to call dad real quick.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.240
Hold on a sec.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.880
I'm going to text out a picture of the blanket too,

29:16.880 --> 29:24.480
because I know his old mind is just a little gooey around the edges.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.080
Little gooey.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.600
Boy, dad's going to be so confused when I send him this picture of a tiger without contact.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.600
What if he sees it?

29:31.600 --> 29:33.040
It's like, that's a cool blanket.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.960
Oh, that would be a good test.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.320
We wouldn't even need to get him on the call.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.000
I just sent it to him and asked him, what's that do for you?

29:44.560 --> 29:45.280
Dad.

29:45.280 --> 29:45.600
Yes?

29:46.480 --> 29:47.760
There's no time.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.640
The tiger blanket that we had at our house.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.320
Do you remember the tiger blanket?

29:52.320 --> 29:54.640
I remember the tiger blanket very well, yes.

29:54.640 --> 30:00.880
How the hell, sorry, Carol, did the tiger blanket get into the house?

30:00.880 --> 30:02.480
How did it make its entryway?

30:03.120 --> 30:06.480
We have theories that you bought it because you thought it looked rad.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.640
My actual one that I'm going to sneak in there is maybe it was a nonny gift.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.480
That is actually feeling kind of powerful to me now that I said it out loud.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.120
How did the tiger blanket arrive into our lives?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.720
You are correct about nonny.

30:23.920 --> 30:24.400
Fuck yes.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.600
That does feel right.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.520
There's more to it than that.

30:28.800 --> 30:32.960
You burned it and then you had to buy a new one because you're afraid she'd find out.

30:32.960 --> 30:40.400
No, she got it because I went to high school, which was the fighting tigers.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.720
Okay, that was the last clue.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.480
That was the last piece of the puzzle.

30:44.480 --> 30:44.800
Okay.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.920
One time nonny sent us lunch meat coasters.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.680
I feel like we've talked about nonny gifts before.

30:49.680 --> 30:54.800
Scented, scented lunch meat coasters that smelled like the lunch meat itself.

30:55.520 --> 30:55.760
Yes.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.360
Painis.

30:57.360 --> 30:57.600
Okay.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.160
Hey dad, thank you so much, bud.

31:00.160 --> 31:00.640
Thank you.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.160
Bye.

31:02.880 --> 31:03.600
Okay, he's gone.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.160
That was fascinating.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.720
That was like our cereal.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.720
That was our cereal, yeah.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.200
And we solved it way quicker than they did.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.720
Take that, Ace.

31:14.720 --> 31:18.240
It says daddy has gone away on the call and that makes me really sad.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.920
Oh boy.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.120
Okay, let's cheer ourselves up with some money.

31:33.440 --> 31:37.440
Did you list him as daddy in the clean feed link?

31:37.440 --> 31:39.120
Okay, so this is fun.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.680
We're using a sort of new software to talk to each other.

31:41.680 --> 31:47.520
Maybe you've heard an incredible, remarkable increase in the quality of the show

31:47.520 --> 31:53.280
since we switched over, but I see you do have me listed as DaGooch here.

31:53.280 --> 31:57.680
You picked the name DaGooch for me when you added me to this session.

31:57.680 --> 31:58.240
I was wondering-

31:58.240 --> 32:00.080
When I add people, I can assign them whatever name I want.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.680
Yeah, so I'm wondering what is, like I'm a professional-

32:04.640 --> 32:04.960
Yeah.

32:04.960 --> 32:05.360
And you-

32:05.360 --> 32:06.720
Well, I got Travis head as Trunk.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.520
I don't care for that.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.920
Trunk with an M, Trump.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.040
Trunk, okay.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.080
And I'm DaGooch.

32:14.080 --> 32:17.200
And I do see you're listed as Justin McElroy.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.960
I don't have anybody to come up with a fun nickname for me.

32:22.960 --> 32:28.160
Okay, well, next time hit me up and maybe we'll come up with some other fun garbage words

32:28.160 --> 32:29.840
that are insulting to your adulthood.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.000
Okay, DaGooch.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.280
Can you read our first ad?

32:33.280 --> 32:33.840
Yeah, sure.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.640
Here come DaGooch to read your new advertisement.

32:36.640 --> 32:37.840
I love it when he says it.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.760
Yeah, his trademark phrase.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.200
Here come DaGooch to tell you about DoorDash.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.680
They specifically requested DaGooch to sound off on this one.

32:50.960 --> 32:56.400
DoorDash is going to get you there with food to your door from restaurants.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.960
Whatever you're craving, right now you can get it at your door with DoorDash.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.800
It's easy as heck to order.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.120
You just open up the DoorDash app, you choose what you want to eat,

33:05.120 --> 33:07.360
your food will be left safely outside your door

33:07.360 --> 33:11.680
with a contactless delivery drop-off setting.

33:11.680 --> 33:15.280
A lot of your local restaurants that maybe you're not able to get into right now

33:15.280 --> 33:22.080
or you're not going to trying to respect social distancing guidelines,

33:22.080 --> 33:23.520
you can still get delivery from them.

33:23.520 --> 33:26.720
If you go open your DoorDash app, you pick your favorite local restaurant,

33:26.720 --> 33:29.280
your food will just get dropped off right there at your dang door.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.560
And right now listeners can get five bucks off their first order of $15 or more

33:32.560 --> 33:35.520
and zero delivery fees for the first month when you download the DoorDash app

33:35.520 --> 33:38.800
and into the code BROTHER. That's five dollars off your first order

33:38.800 --> 33:41.200
and zero delivery fees for a month when you download the DoorDash app

33:41.200 --> 33:42.720
in the App Store and enter code BROTHER.

33:42.720 --> 33:47.840
Don't forget, that's code BROTHER for five dollars off your first order with DoorDash.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.000
Hey Justin, can I ask you a question?

33:50.640 --> 33:51.440
I'd love that, Trev.

33:51.440 --> 33:54.800
In your life, what would you say is the thing you're most proud of?

33:54.800 --> 34:01.440
Probably that at least half of my children seem to be decent human beings.

34:01.440 --> 34:06.800
Okay, for me, it's a website I made using Squarespace called buttercupisaveverygoodgirl.com.

34:07.600 --> 34:08.800
That's a website I made.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.400
There's just a lot of pictures of my dog.

34:10.400 --> 34:14.080
There's even like a flash game on there about how great my dog Buttercup is.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.080
And I was able to do that through Squarespace.

34:16.080 --> 34:20.080
And that's way better than any kind of kid or, I don't know,

34:20.080 --> 34:22.160
joy you get from family or anything like that.

34:22.160 --> 34:27.040
Because Squarespace can showcase your work, sell products and services of all kinds,

34:27.040 --> 34:30.240
promote your physical or online business, and more.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.680
You shouldn't be saying stuff like this.

34:31.680 --> 34:32.640
This is fucked up.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.320
It says it right there, though.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.520
I didn't write that in the copy.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.640
Guys, listen, I want everybody at home to know that Squarespace didn't write that.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.520
Travis is being pretty fucked up right now if you ask me.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.600
It says it right here in my copy.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.880
Do you not see it?

34:44.880 --> 34:49.920
Okay, I'm just saying I got a Squarespace website about how much I love my incredible son.

34:49.920 --> 34:54.640
And I know Justin has one also for my incredible son because he's really very powerful.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.320
Yeah, it's griffinsincredible son.com.

34:58.320 --> 34:58.560
Yeah.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.680
Fuck.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.200
Yeah, Justin, you gotta stop wishing that shit into existence.

35:04.640 --> 35:09.520
I have to get it before the show goes out or I just won't do it.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.760
And they also have analytics that help you grow in real time,

35:14.640 --> 35:18.320
free and secure hosting, and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

35:18.320 --> 35:22.800
And it comes with a full gallery of pictures of Griffin's powerful son.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.560
He's mighty, guys.

35:24.560 --> 35:28.880
He's so fucking strong and he scares me with how powerful his muscles are.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.080
And no matter what your website is for,

35:32.080 --> 35:35.280
if you include one picture of Griffin's powerful son,

35:35.280 --> 35:38.240
your website traffic will increase exponentially.

35:38.240 --> 35:41.360
Just be careful because I did play catch with him and he broke my collarbone.

35:43.440 --> 35:47.280
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.320
Hey, I'm Janet Farney, host of the JV Club Podcast.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.040
Ah, high school.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.480
Was it a time of adventure, romance, and discovery?

36:06.480 --> 36:09.840
Class of 95, we did it!

36:09.840 --> 36:14.800
Or a time of angst, disappointment, and confusion?

36:14.800 --> 36:17.840
We're all tied together by four years of trauma at this place,

36:17.840 --> 36:19.600
but enjoy adulthood, I guess.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.200
The truth is, it was both.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.880
So join me on the JV Club Podcast,

36:26.880 --> 36:30.240
where I invite some great friends like Kristen Bell, Angela Kinsey,

36:30.240 --> 36:33.040
Oscar Nunez, Neil Patrick Harris, and Keegan-Michael Key

36:33.040 --> 36:36.640
to talk about high school, the good, the bad, and everything in between.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.680
My teenage mood swings are getting harder to manage!

36:39.680 --> 36:42.000
The JV Club. Find it on Maximum Fun.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.640
Uh, I gotta have a Yahoo or-

36:44.640 --> 36:45.120
Ba ba ba ba ba ba.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.800
Yeah, that was the other option.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.520
Da da da ba ba ba bum.

36:49.520 --> 36:54.400
Can't make this theme song long enough to cover my hover purchase.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.120
Typing in my personal information.

37:00.160 --> 37:03.120
God, I can't take the risk that somebody else will get it.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.640
Now it's in my cart.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.920
I want a munch!

37:05.920 --> 37:07.120
Squad!

37:07.120 --> 37:10.240
While I type in my credit card info.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.360
I want a munch!

37:11.360 --> 37:12.240
Squad!

37:12.960 --> 37:14.320
Good news, it's saved in there.

37:14.320 --> 37:18.160
I'm just clicking submit.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.040
Welcome to Munch Squad.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.120
It's a podcast within a podcast.

37:21.120 --> 37:26.160
And now we are headed into Munch Squad flashback, as I call it,

37:26.160 --> 37:28.800
which is a podcast within a podcast,

37:29.920 --> 37:36.080
within a podcast where we talk about the oldest and greatest in brand eating.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.600
I am so excited.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.080
Oh boy.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.440
I'm really excited about this one.

37:43.440 --> 37:48.720
I have a huge debt to Kyle for sharing this with me

37:50.160 --> 37:54.000
because it is, God, what a treat.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.640
So the year, I want to take you back a little bit.

37:56.640 --> 38:00.720
The year is 2008.

38:00.720 --> 38:01.360
Okay.

38:01.360 --> 38:05.600
And it's the dog days of summer, August 26th.

38:06.480 --> 38:13.120
But as the temperature is rising, so is the tide of rock and roll,

38:13.120 --> 38:17.040
which is experiencing a rebirth at Denny's.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.320
Denny's pairs with rockers for new menu.

38:25.280 --> 38:28.880
Denny's is rolling out a new all night rockstar menu.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.440
Top musicians such as, we're going to cover that in a moment,

38:34.000 --> 38:38.560
join Denny's to create the new Denny's rockstar menu presented by Dr. Pepper.

38:38.560 --> 38:43.440
Quote, we teamed up with popular bands in an out of the box way

38:43.440 --> 38:49.760
to develop a menu by rockstars for our rockstar guests, says Mark Schmel,

38:49.760 --> 38:52.560
chief marketing and innovation officer for Denny's.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.280
Music and late night are part of the Denny's DNA.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.960
Denny's has been a late night destination for musicians, fans,

38:58.960 --> 39:01.040
crews and crowds for over 50 years.

39:01.040 --> 39:05.840
So it is natural for us to have them create the meal they would most like to eat.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.160
Is that true?

39:08.160 --> 39:12.880
The late night diner asked four of bands, that's what it said,

39:12.880 --> 39:14.240
to cook up something special.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.040
Wait, really?

39:15.040 --> 39:16.240
It says four of bands.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.640
This is my favorite tarot card.

39:19.200 --> 39:23.840
To cook up something special for Denny's 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. menu.

39:24.560 --> 39:29.600
The bands, along with Denny's culinary innovation chef, Andrew Dismore,

39:29.600 --> 39:32.560
what a thrill this afternoon must have been for Andrew,

39:32.560 --> 39:36.560
invented dishes that are ideal for late night dining with friends and groups.

39:36.560 --> 39:42.240
The new menu items created by rockstars include taking back bacon burger fries

39:42.240 --> 39:44.880
created by New York based band Taking Back Sunday.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.560
It combines two of the artist's favorite foods,

39:48.560 --> 39:50.960
bacon cheeseburger and loaded cheese fries.

39:53.840 --> 39:59.360
The Plain White Shake by Chicago band The Plain White Teas.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.720
Blends whole milk, vanilla ice cream, you know, shake shit.

40:02.720 --> 40:08.080
Heart on a Plate by California rockers Eagles of Death Metal starts with

40:08.080 --> 40:10.400
heart-shaped pancakes topped with raspberry sauce,

40:10.400 --> 40:15.200
heart fudge, strawberries, white chocolate chips and whipped cream.

40:15.200 --> 40:19.120
The heart-themed entree, a tribute to their soon-to-be-released album,

40:19.120 --> 40:22.160
Heart On, good for you Eagles of Death Metal,

40:22.160 --> 40:25.120
is served with crispy bacon and eggs in any style.

40:26.480 --> 40:31.680
The All-American SOS brings the timeless classic and hometown favorite dish

40:31.680 --> 40:35.200
of Stillwater, Oklahoma, band The All-American Rejects to life

40:35.200 --> 40:38.240
with hamburger, cheese, grilled onions and gravy

40:38.240 --> 40:40.560
on top of Texas toast and hash browns.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.200
Denny's is striving to appeal to the late night crowd

40:45.200 --> 40:48.160
with a whole new vibe from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.680
And this is pretty, like, you want to be careful if you're going with kids

40:52.240 --> 40:56.080
during this time frame, because in 2008, because it was pretty fucking nasty.

40:56.080 --> 41:00.320
They featured alternative music, alternative rock music,

41:00.320 --> 41:02.880
alternative rock music playing through the restaurant

41:02.880 --> 41:07.280
and servers sporting t-shirts and jeans instead of the usual uniforms.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.960
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

41:08.960 --> 41:09.600
Whoa.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.560
Do the t-shirts at least say Denny's on them?

41:12.560 --> 41:13.920
So I do know I'm still in a Denny's.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.120
There's no way of knowing without a time machine.

41:17.120 --> 41:22.640
In keeping with this rock and roll history, Denny's is also lending a helping hand

41:22.640 --> 41:26.720
to emerging bands through the Adopt a Band program.

41:26.720 --> 41:27.360
Oh, boy.

41:27.360 --> 41:30.480
Bands can enter to become a Denny's Adopted Band.

41:31.360 --> 41:37.440
So I this site, which is Denny'sAllNighter.com, no longer functions.

41:37.440 --> 41:43.120
But I did dip into the archive to just go ahead and see some of the bands

41:43.680 --> 41:49.600
like Cash Cash, William Control, The Sleeping, Bring Me the Horizon,

41:49.600 --> 41:52.560
Tickle Me Pink, You, Me and Everyone We Know

41:53.840 --> 41:57.040
were just some of the Denny's sponsor bands.

41:57.040 --> 42:03.840
And this website is a blog of these small bands eating at Denny's all around the nation.

42:03.840 --> 42:06.240
And they would have like a fan meetup.

42:06.240 --> 42:11.040
After a show, they just go to the local Denny's and have an after party.

42:11.040 --> 42:18.800
And there's pictures documenting people eating at Denny's with their fans.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.800
Damn, it's like I can taste the Warped Tour.

42:21.440 --> 42:21.840
I know.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.560
I have great news for you.

42:24.560 --> 42:31.040
Okay, this promotion was so successful that they went ahead and just did another round

42:32.720 --> 42:34.160
of of people.

42:34.160 --> 42:38.080
They did a whole other round to add to the Rockstar menu.

42:39.520 --> 42:44.000
Some 41 made an unnamed French toast sandwich.

42:44.640 --> 42:48.720
They didn't go with Yum Yum 41 Yum 41.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.840
It's right there.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.280
Yum 41.

42:53.280 --> 42:59.200
Some 41 stopped by to make a French toast sandwich at the lab, the food lab.

43:00.080 --> 43:04.720
And miraculously, and I am so thankful to internet for this.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.880
It did so many things wrong.

43:06.880 --> 43:12.480
But somehow the comments from this February 24th, 2009 story aren't still alive.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.040
Rock and roll breakfast smile.

43:15.920 --> 43:18.560
OMG, that actually looks not bad.

43:19.120 --> 43:22.080
I will have to try and make something like that sometime tomorrow

43:22.080 --> 43:24.880
if I get around to it or remember it for that matter.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.320
Just go to Denny's.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.440
Just go to Denny's.

43:27.440 --> 43:28.960
They make it for you at Denny's.

43:29.920 --> 43:31.280
Dang, they're creative.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.560
That looks superbly good.

43:33.600 --> 43:37.840
Cooking, even cooking looks fun when some 41 is doing it.

43:37.840 --> 43:38.640
Oh my God.

43:40.400 --> 43:44.000
Justin, are you going to go over the other menu items?

43:44.000 --> 43:44.880
Well, let's see.

43:44.880 --> 43:48.480
Here's the first thing I want to say is that Taking Back Sunday made another one.

43:48.480 --> 43:49.040
Yeah.

43:49.040 --> 43:52.560
Like apparently Taking Back Sunday was so deeply into this

43:52.560 --> 43:55.120
that they just like did another one.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.880
And it's called the melty grilled chicken and sausage quesadilla.

43:59.600 --> 44:04.320
They've just kind of given up the conceit of making it be a part of their name also.

44:05.200 --> 44:09.040
At that point, Taking Back Sunday had just bought a couple Denny's franchises

44:09.040 --> 44:10.880
and they were just looking to be successful.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.200
They weren't really worried about the tie-in so much as they're like,

44:13.200 --> 44:16.720
I think this will be a good meal at a fair price that people will enjoy.

44:16.720 --> 44:22.400
Boys like girls introduced a hot prime rib sandwich called the Great Egg Steak.

44:22.400 --> 44:22.900
Huh.

44:23.920 --> 44:29.120
And I do, let me just check and see if, yes.

44:29.600 --> 44:34.480
Hoobastank serves up a burrito with crispy chicken strips,

44:34.480 --> 44:37.760
pepper jack cheese, cheese sauce, fried onion, crispers,

44:37.760 --> 44:40.080
and a hint of barbecue sauce.

44:40.080 --> 44:43.280
Serve with tortillas and a side of cheese sauce and ranch dressing.

44:43.280 --> 44:47.040
And yes, it is called the Hoobarito.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.680
I, can I, can I say something?

44:49.680 --> 44:52.560
Hey, hey guys, maybe unpopular opinion.

44:53.600 --> 44:55.280
I'd fuck that clean up.

44:55.760 --> 44:56.260
Yeah.

44:56.720 --> 45:02.000
Hey Hoobastank, you've devised a very clever burrito there.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.640
Yeah, who knew instead of polluting the airwaves throughout the 2000s,

45:06.640 --> 45:11.520
they should have been just making like drunk food apparently.

45:11.520 --> 45:14.480
I would drink this one dead sober.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.600
I mean, eat it.

45:15.600 --> 45:19.840
I would drink it too, hard pressed, if that's the only option available to me.

45:19.840 --> 45:24.400
Katy Perry also made a hot and cold cherry chocolate cappuccino.

45:24.400 --> 45:28.320
But how can it be hot and cold?

45:28.320 --> 45:28.640
Because-

45:28.640 --> 45:33.520
Let's check with Katy who said, quote, it's hot, it's cold,

45:33.520 --> 45:35.920
it's a love affair for your taste buds.

45:35.920 --> 45:39.760
Yes, but I'm no scientist, but it says here that-

45:39.760 --> 45:42.560
Then maybe you should shut your mouth because Ms. Perry is-

45:42.560 --> 45:45.840
But it's the concoction includes, I'm sorry Griffin,

45:45.840 --> 45:49.440
but the concoction includes vanilla ice cream, hot fudge.

45:49.440 --> 45:49.940
Hot.

45:50.480 --> 45:54.320
And it's right, like I've literally just shot your whole shit down right there,

45:54.320 --> 45:55.520
Dr. Scientist Travis.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.760
But, and French and vanilla cappuccino.

45:57.760 --> 46:02.800
Seems to me, like if you pour hot fudge and French vanilla cappuccino over ice cream,

46:02.800 --> 46:06.320
what you end up with is a pretty room temperature drink.

46:06.320 --> 46:12.240
I will also say that it would be wild to drink coffee and then encounter cherry.

46:12.960 --> 46:15.760
There's a cherry in my coffee, that's very strange.

46:16.720 --> 46:20.720
But I guess Katy made that herself, so I'm not gonna get all up on her rant about it.

46:21.760 --> 46:25.680
This website, there's not like a linear into it.

46:25.680 --> 46:29.600
Maybe if anybody else wants to dig in there to the Denny's All Nighter archive,

46:30.640 --> 46:32.720
some of our beloved listeners want to do that,

46:32.720 --> 46:35.600
let us know if you find anything else good and we'll be sure to pass that along.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.880
But that is our Munch Squad.

46:36.880 --> 46:42.720
I can't, like, everybody's hurting economically, for sure.

46:43.280 --> 46:47.680
But it is a good way to remember that there was one point when people had,

46:47.680 --> 46:49.840
I think we'll all agree, too much money.

46:49.840 --> 46:50.320
Yeah.

46:50.320 --> 46:51.120
You know what I mean?

46:51.120 --> 46:55.600
Like, they just had too much money, so this kind of fixed that a little bit.

46:56.320 --> 46:58.080
Made them have less, you know what I mean?

46:58.080 --> 46:58.400
Yeah.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.920
Because we did have too much.

46:59.920 --> 47:00.240
I think-

47:00.240 --> 47:02.320
So less money in this sense is okay.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.080
I do think this is what inflation is.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.400
Okay, okay.

47:07.120 --> 47:10.560
Here's just a quick Yahoo that several people sent in by One Punch Man.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.360
Thank you.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.720
Or wait, that's who asked it.

47:12.720 --> 47:17.520
I don't want to thank them because they do ask, are hippos stab proof?

47:19.120 --> 47:20.880
I heard the hippos are close to bulletproof,

47:20.880 --> 47:24.320
so they could certainly shrug off a sword attack by a human, right?

47:26.000 --> 47:28.800
Now, there's a lot posited there.

47:29.360 --> 47:29.840
Yeah.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.080
Yeah.

47:30.080 --> 47:34.000
Yeah, how could something be almost bulletproof?

47:34.560 --> 47:38.240
I don't want to celebrate the idea of hurting a beautiful hippopotamus,

47:39.440 --> 47:42.640
but I do enjoy the fact that they are apparently,

47:42.640 --> 47:46.400
they can't be killed with bullets.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.640
There's almost like a-

47:48.640 --> 47:49.280
Almost.

47:49.280 --> 47:49.760
Almost.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.880
How have we measured that, I wonder?

47:52.880 --> 47:53.760
That's what I'm saying.

47:53.760 --> 47:58.640
How do you quantify, is it like some bullets will hurt it and some won't,

47:58.640 --> 48:00.240
or it only hurts it a little bit?

48:00.240 --> 48:03.120
I feel like it gets shot a bunch and then the doctor comes out and it's like,

48:03.120 --> 48:05.680
well, it was touch and go there for a while.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.960
I did think that it would survive, and then as it turns out, it did not.

48:10.240 --> 48:11.840
It was very close, though.

48:11.840 --> 48:12.640
It was very close.

48:12.640 --> 48:17.520
Or just a very unethical scientist lined up five hippos, shot five of them, and two died.

48:17.520 --> 48:21.280
And they're like, well, damn, that's, I'm gonna call it,

48:21.280 --> 48:24.800
that's pretty, that's more bulletproof than us humans are.

48:26.640 --> 48:27.840
So a sword attack.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.120
Hippos are dangerous, right?

48:29.120 --> 48:30.880
Like hippo, and I don't-

48:30.880 --> 48:32.400
Oh, hippos are monsters.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.040
Yeah, I don't wanna stand with that.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.360
That's why they have them on the Disney Jungle Cruise.

48:36.880 --> 48:38.000
Yeah, they, yeah.

48:38.000 --> 48:47.200
And so I would argue you're not gonna be able to get in there.

48:47.200 --> 48:52.240
Like you could have a lot of like incredible sword technique.

48:52.240 --> 48:56.880
You've been studying the blade and the blockchain while the rest of us were partying.

48:56.880 --> 49:02.160
But I do think you get within a certain distance of one of these big, powerful beasts.

49:02.160 --> 49:05.680
And like, you're just gonna, that part of your brain,

49:05.680 --> 49:09.040
the sword fighting part of your brain is just gonna like be completely overwhelmed

49:09.040 --> 49:11.520
by the part that makes you shit your pants and fall down.

49:12.160 --> 49:17.760
And I would say the exact opposite would be true for the hippopotamus.

49:17.760 --> 49:22.400
Because I don't believe that the hippopotamus would see you wielding a sword and think, oh no.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.840
Oh no, I should stay away.

49:24.640 --> 49:26.640
They would, I think in most situations,

49:26.640 --> 49:28.240
and maybe this is why hippos are so dangerous,

49:28.240 --> 49:31.760
is that they just always have the thought in their mind of like, I got this.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.880
I'm so big.

49:32.880 --> 49:34.240
I'm a hungry, hungry guy.

49:35.440 --> 49:36.720
I'm gonna munch that dude.

49:38.560 --> 49:42.560
Apparently hipposkin is very thick and quote resistant to puncture.

49:42.560 --> 49:47.040
So I guess it does come down to the sort of like sharpness.

49:48.400 --> 49:49.440
How about, let's see.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.200
No, we're gonna keep talking about this.

49:52.080 --> 49:52.320
Okay.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.600
Okay.

49:55.600 --> 49:59.920
I think we can all agree that the only way to stab a hippo is from the inside out.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.960
Oh, like Ace Ventura.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.800
Fuck, I still bust the fuck up whenever I think about that scene.

50:07.360 --> 50:08.960
Oh, it's a rhinoceros, isn't it?

50:09.760 --> 50:11.760
Remember he climbs out the rhino's butthole?

50:11.760 --> 50:14.000
Justin, you've never seen any movie with Jim Carrey in it.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.600
No, he climbs out the rhino's butthole into a hippopotamus butthole.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.160
Right.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.680
Forever, back and forth.

50:19.680 --> 50:22.480
Justin, I do want you to do this third question before we go,

50:22.480 --> 50:23.520
because I love it a lot.

50:25.920 --> 50:27.360
We're already running long, aren't you?

50:27.360 --> 50:28.800
Oh, they're worth it, Juice.

50:28.800 --> 50:29.520
They're worth it.

50:29.520 --> 50:31.360
All right, all right, all right.

50:31.360 --> 50:34.240
Just for you guys, just for our beloved fans.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.560
This one's for you, the fans.

50:37.120 --> 50:40.320
When I was in third grade, my school held a writing competition.

50:40.320 --> 50:42.800
I submitted a story and it was one of the winners.

50:42.800 --> 50:46.640
I got a $5 McDonald's gift card and that was the last I thought of it.

50:46.640 --> 50:49.040
Until recently, when my old elementary school announced that

50:49.040 --> 50:52.240
they'd be releasing a book of all the stories that had won the competition

50:52.240 --> 50:55.280
as a way to look fondly on pre-quarantine times.

50:55.280 --> 50:59.680
The problem is, I plagiarized my story from an encyclopedia brown book.

51:00.560 --> 51:04.560
I changed the names of the characters, but it was still otherwise exactly the same.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.200
Thesaurus Green!

51:07.200 --> 51:10.160
Was reckless and thought of nothing of the consequences,

51:10.160 --> 51:13.440
but now I'm afraid the story will be released and everybody will see what a fraud I am.

51:13.440 --> 51:16.320
How do I stop my story from being released without raising suspicion?

51:16.320 --> 51:18.320
That's from Playdress in Pennsylvania.

51:18.320 --> 51:19.680
Holy shit.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.480
I'm gonna see if Donald J. Sobel's still alive.

51:23.440 --> 51:27.280
If he's been dead for seven years, technically, I think you can't plagiarize him anymore.

51:27.840 --> 51:30.080
Pretty sure that's how copyright law works.

51:30.080 --> 51:33.520
Ah, but you're not thinking about the expiration of the crime, Griffin.

51:33.520 --> 51:36.160
Hey, great news, Donald J. Sobel is dead.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.920
No, wait, eight years ago.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.920
So it's, okay, that's fine.

51:39.920 --> 51:40.640
So that's fine.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.600
Legally, you're in the clear.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.200
Let's talk about ethics and morals.

51:44.240 --> 51:47.680
Yeah, I think that is actually not great news that Donald J. Sobel.

51:47.680 --> 51:48.800
No, it's not dead.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.000
I'm sorry I phrased it the way.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I don't want people to take that out of context.

51:53.440 --> 51:56.080
Listen, you're about to have a great shame brought upon your house.

51:56.080 --> 51:59.760
And I don't know what else to say.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.360
There's no way to get around that.

52:01.360 --> 52:05.680
You can't go to the school and hack into the transcript.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.160
That ship has sailed.

52:08.160 --> 52:12.640
You fucked up so bad so long ago, and there's no way to put more English on the ball.

52:12.640 --> 52:21.040
Could you blame it on Donald J. Sobel and say that he must have gotten a hold of your rough draft

52:21.040 --> 52:24.160
and published it, stealing your story?

52:25.200 --> 52:25.600
Yeah, you're gonna have to-

52:25.600 --> 52:26.320
This isn't great.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.840
Listen, I love Encyclopedia Brown.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.280
I love Donald J. Sobel.

52:29.280 --> 52:33.760
I hate to, but I'm saying you could pin it on him.

52:33.760 --> 52:34.400
Yeah.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.880
That would be a real bugziney thing to do, though.

52:36.880 --> 52:46.080
I think that if you do plant, and God, I really don't want to besmirch this dude's name,

52:46.720 --> 52:52.320
but if you do plant the $5 McDonald's gift card in his desk, it's gonna be a confusing clue.

52:52.960 --> 52:58.320
But the police, I think any detective worth their salt is gonna find that and,

52:58.880 --> 53:03.040
you know, figure out the frame that you're putting together here.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.720
You're probably gonna have to fake your own death.

53:04.720 --> 53:09.680
Yeah, it's overfreak- Yeah, that's a good note, Trev.

53:10.960 --> 53:15.920
It's probably time, no matter what you do, to start taking stock of your life as it is now

53:15.920 --> 53:18.560
and start sort of wrapping up some of your affairs,

53:19.840 --> 53:26.160
because your life won't really resemble what you know right now, you know what I mean?

53:26.160 --> 53:28.240
It'll be a very different life that you'll be leading,

53:29.440 --> 53:31.440
and I think that it's good to be prepared for that.

53:31.440 --> 53:35.360
Like, a good idea that excites me on a very personal level.

53:36.160 --> 53:38.320
You should email your teacher and be like,

53:38.320 --> 53:44.880
oh, that's great, I've actually done a few edits to that draft, and I think honestly-

53:44.880 --> 53:47.520
I've been working on it for the last 20 years!

53:47.520 --> 53:50.320
Yeah, and I think it'd be honestly pretty fucked up for you to put out

53:50.320 --> 53:53.040
my first draft of it, and here's a new version of it.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.360
And your new version of it could be a completely different thing.

53:55.360 --> 54:00.160
Now, what excites me is I would love to take another pass at Grand Andrews Kid Cop.

54:00.160 --> 54:03.280
I've had some ideas about Grand Andrews Kid Cop

54:03.280 --> 54:05.600
that I think could really flesh out the lore.

54:05.600 --> 54:09.520
I would probably remove all of the references to Jet Moto,

54:09.520 --> 54:13.600
a very unsuccessful PlayStation 1 era racing game.

54:13.600 --> 54:16.000
That one can probably hit the bricks.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.680
This is going to get you out of the scrape,

54:17.680 --> 54:21.520
but it's also going to allow you to punch up your work.

54:21.520 --> 54:25.360
Although actually, your work was stolen, so you will maybe make it worse.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.920
Definitely make it worse. There's no question about that.

54:27.920 --> 54:30.240
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.520
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

54:32.320 --> 54:35.600
We are sure happy that you're with us.

54:35.600 --> 54:40.160
We know that podcast listening time is a bit cattywumpus right now,

54:40.160 --> 54:43.600
so we very much appreciate that you've carved out the time

54:43.600 --> 54:46.240
to experience our program.

54:46.800 --> 54:50.320
We wrote a book with our dad. It's called The Adventure Zone.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.920
It pales to the metal. It comes out in July.

54:51.920 --> 54:54.240
You can pre-order it now at TheAdventureZoneComic.com.

54:54.240 --> 54:57.360
We have merchandise. We have our summer stickers.

54:57.360 --> 55:00.720
If you want to buy some of those, McElroyMerch.com.

55:00.720 --> 55:04.000
We got some fun stuff there, if you want that.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.640
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

55:06.640 --> 55:07.760
for the use of our theme song

55:07.760 --> 55:09.920
and to departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

55:09.920 --> 55:12.800
which you can go listen to at any time and no one can stop you.

55:12.800 --> 55:15.200
And also Max Pun Fun.

55:15.200 --> 55:20.000
What? Max Pun Fun.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.400
What? Max Pun Fun.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.080
Oh, you know what? I will plug something.

55:26.080 --> 55:29.600
Griffin and I make a video series called Monster Factory.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.520
If you've never watched it, it's on our YouTube channel.

55:31.520 --> 55:32.640
Just search YouTube for it.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.760
And I think our new one's really funny.

55:35.760 --> 55:36.800
It just came out last week.

55:36.800 --> 55:41.520
So if you want to watch it, it's based on Dark Souls 3.

55:41.520 --> 55:44.000
It's an adaptation of Dark Souls 3.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I enjoyed it. I watched it. I watch every—

55:46.000 --> 55:48.720
I also listen to Besties, the video game podcast

55:48.720 --> 55:50.080
that Justin and Griffin do,

55:50.080 --> 55:52.080
along with Russ Freshtick and Chris Plant,

55:52.800 --> 55:55.120
which is a Spotify original that I enjoy very much.

55:55.120 --> 55:57.440
I listen to it as soon as each episode comes out,

55:57.440 --> 56:01.040
though I have many feelings on the Bioshock episode

56:01.040 --> 56:03.040
that we will talk about off mic.

56:03.040 --> 56:04.400
We'll unpack that later.

56:05.200 --> 56:10.400
I also wanted to say, coming up on June 6th at 1pm Eastern time,

56:10.960 --> 56:14.720
I am going to be doing a live stream Dungeons and Dragons session

56:14.720 --> 56:20.480
along with Will Rowland, Alex Boniello, and Andrew Barth Feldman,

56:20.480 --> 56:23.680
who you may recognize from Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway,

56:23.680 --> 56:28.560
as well as Matthew Mercer, Erica Ishii, and Satine Phoenix,

56:28.560 --> 56:32.560
who you might recognize from the World of Actual Play podcasts.

56:32.560 --> 56:36.160
We're going to be playing D&D and raising money for the Actors Fund,

56:36.160 --> 56:39.600
as well as Feeding America, and I'm going to be DMing.

56:40.480 --> 56:43.200
You can watch that. It's going to be on a Twitch channel.

56:43.200 --> 56:47.760
So the whole thing is called Supporting Roles, R-O-L-L-S,

56:48.560 --> 56:51.360
and you're going to be able to watch it on our Twitch channel,

56:51.920 --> 56:54.480
twitch.tv supporting roles,

56:54.480 --> 57:01.680
and you can go donate now if you go to bit.ly supporting IGG,

57:01.680 --> 57:04.480
all lowercase, and that's our IndieGoGo,

57:04.480 --> 57:06.400
and there are some reward levels there.

57:06.400 --> 57:10.160
You can name NPCs, you can name the tavern we meet at,

57:10.160 --> 57:13.520
you can like spring surprise monsters on the players,

57:13.520 --> 57:16.800
you can give them magical items, all kinds of stuff,

57:16.800 --> 57:19.840
or you could just like donate if you wanted to.

57:19.840 --> 57:21.440
So go check that out.

57:21.440 --> 57:25.200
And that's going to once again be June 6th, 1 p.m. Eastern time.

57:26.240 --> 57:26.740
Cool.

57:27.360 --> 57:29.680
I would love to read a Final Yahoo,

57:29.680 --> 57:36.400
but I have just actually found a link to a recipe

57:36.400 --> 57:40.240
recreating the Denny's Hoot Burrito experience.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.920
Can I just read that?

57:43.920 --> 57:45.760
Like I could take a passage just reading that.

57:45.760 --> 57:46.800
Go for it.

57:46.800 --> 57:47.520
Yeah, sure, yeah.

57:47.520 --> 57:49.280
So you're going to need a half cup of chicken breast,

57:49.280 --> 57:50.720
and you're going to want that to be shredded up.

57:51.840 --> 57:52.880
You're going to need some cheese.

57:52.880 --> 57:54.640
It just says cheese sauce.

57:54.640 --> 57:56.480
This doesn't seem like a very good recipe.

57:56.480 --> 57:57.600
I'll get back to y'all.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.760
We'll come up with our own Hoot Burrito recipe

57:59.760 --> 58:00.640
and get back to y'all.

58:01.280 --> 58:02.480
But here is another.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.960
This one's a real Yahoo that was sent in by Paul.

58:04.960 --> 58:05.920
Thanks, Paul.

58:05.920 --> 58:08.640
It's from Yahoo Answers user Asep, who asks,

58:10.080 --> 58:12.880
is it true that dogs lick us

58:12.880 --> 58:15.760
because we have bones inside of us that they want to eat?

58:18.720 --> 58:20.080
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.280
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:22.880 --> 58:24.240
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

58:24.240 --> 58:37.280
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

58:37.280 --> 58:45.120

58:57.040 --> 59:00.960
After 10 years of production, Judge John Hodgman has finally won.

59:01.520 --> 59:03.760
The Susan Lucci of the Webbys.

59:03.760 --> 59:05.520
What is Judge John Hodgman?

59:08.240 --> 59:12.480
settles disputes between friends, family, co-workers, partners, and more.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.120
Is machine gun a robot?

59:15.120 --> 59:18.000
Should a grown adult tell his parents about his tattoos?

59:18.000 --> 59:21.520
Should a family be compelled to wear matching outfits on vacation?

59:21.520 --> 59:25.520
Listen to Judge John Hodgman to find out the answers to these age-old disputes and more.
