00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:47.040
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern

00:47.040 --> 00:51.440
era. Around these parts they call me Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. I'm your

00:51.440 --> 00:57.280
middle-est brother, and people know me as Travis McElroy, for as far as they know.

00:57.280 --> 01:03.040
Oh, and I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. You might know my Deep Web username

01:03.040 --> 01:18.080
as Bitcoin Skrillex Dog Boner 420... 4206969. Boys, I wanted to talk to you guys about something

01:18.080 --> 01:25.200
that is a new sort of concern, a new interest, a new worldview that I've only sort of recently

01:25.200 --> 01:29.520
adopted, but it has become basically instantly very, very important to me, basically all consuming.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.840
Because I don't know about how you guys feel, but like I've been looking at the success of our

01:33.840 --> 01:38.560
show and just the millions that we're making off of it, and I'm thinking about like,

01:39.200 --> 01:45.280
I'm trying to think about like what we've given back, just like not with the money, like the

01:45.280 --> 01:51.760
money's fucking ours, obviously, but like... They'll get their cut with the estate tax.

01:51.760 --> 01:57.680
Right. I think you mean the Barack Hussein Obama's death tax.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.080
You know, a lot of people forget about the Hussein.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.840
A lot of people do, and I think it's important. Anyway, there's a concern that I want to talk

02:03.840 --> 02:07.840
about, and I think it's like a way that the three of us can really channel our power and use it for

02:07.840 --> 02:13.440
good, use our broad reach for good. I want to talk to you about a Twitter user who tweeted at me

02:13.440 --> 02:22.320
a little over one hour ago, and this Twitter user's handle is BubbleJug1. Okay. Uh-huh. Now,

02:22.320 --> 02:28.720
you may remember BubbleJug as being the... I'm going to put quotes, big heavy quotes, bold,

02:28.720 --> 02:37.360
all caps quotes, candy made by Nestle, part of the Hubba Bubba franchise, and it was bubble gum

02:37.360 --> 02:44.160
that came in a powdered form in a little nasty jug. Oh my God, I remember that nasty jug. Yeah, I remember that skank

02:44.160 --> 02:50.160
jug. You remember that skanky jug full of that basically gum dirt that you would put in your

02:50.160 --> 02:57.760
mouth and then keep it there like a chore until gum happened. Uh-huh. It was like space age,

02:57.760 --> 03:06.080
the dipping dots of gum. Yeah, it was certainly dipping because it was gum-based snus, and it was

03:06.080 --> 03:11.680
as delicious as that sounds. I would love to sing for you the ballad of BubbleJug, this Twitter user

03:11.680 --> 03:17.360
who has at this moment five tweets, and the five tweets starts off just sort of a shot across the

03:17.360 --> 03:22.320
fucking America's bow. It is time for the global community to finally put their minds toward a goal

03:22.320 --> 03:27.280
worthy of our genius. Hubba Bubba, bring back BubbleJug. Just like putting that out there, and

03:27.280 --> 03:34.000
then in a separate tweet, hashtags, bring back BubbleJug and jug life. So they know exactly

03:34.000 --> 03:40.320
what they're doing here. By the way, if you take this segment as you're going to fucking make a

03:41.440 --> 03:46.160
revive Tastation's Twitter account and start haranguing, this is a once in a lifetime lightning

03:46.160 --> 03:52.480
in a bottle. This was a perfect series of tweets. Griffin, can I recommend a name for the movement

03:52.480 --> 03:57.440
or for the group that's in the movement? I mean, jug life is already very good, but go ahead.

03:57.440 --> 04:03.520
BubbleJuggalos? It's very, very good also. Also very good. Damn it. So a little over an hour ago,

04:03.520 --> 04:10.320
I got a tweet from BubbleJug. It said, as a true visionary DM and father of digital monsters,

04:10.320 --> 04:13.680
you should get behind our movement to bring back BubbleJug, hashtag jug life. That's great.

04:14.720 --> 04:20.720
Wait, so is BubbleJug no number taken? Is there already an app BubbleJug, so they had to be

04:20.720 --> 04:24.800
BubbleJug one? I mean, Nestle probably has it locked down so that somebody doesn't

04:24.800 --> 04:29.840
misrepresent the brand because they'll never bring it back. It's an egg. BubbleJug's an egg.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.360
Is it tweeting like mean things that like- Nope, nothing.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.160
Women in the games industry? No. Take this fucking bazooka, Joe.

04:37.760 --> 04:44.560
BubbleJug has one, has two other tweets, and these tweets are to two other people,

04:44.560 --> 04:50.320
and they are, I'm honored to be like among this sort of assembly of people that BubbleJug one

04:51.040 --> 04:58.000
thinks is capable of getting this brand, just breathing the sweet creative breath of life

04:58.000 --> 05:02.640
back into the lungs of the BubbleJug brand, because that list, according to BubbleJug one,

05:02.640 --> 05:08.160
is myself and then Sean Puffy Combs. Right.

05:09.360 --> 05:13.280
And then, of course, Lil Wayne, the Lillest of Waynes.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.160
Have the three of you gotten together for your G8 summit this year yet,

05:18.160 --> 05:22.080
or is that happening like in the- We just call ourselves the three Gs,

05:22.080 --> 05:26.320
and you know that. They call it the GR8 summit. It's great.

05:26.320 --> 05:31.520
And they're getting the jug up and running. I mean, this has certainly moved up my- Oh,

05:31.520 --> 05:34.160
Justin, I see you've gone ahead and followed BubbleJug one.

05:34.160 --> 05:39.600
No fucking question. Absolutely, Griffin. One thing that I like about BubbleJug,

05:39.600 --> 05:45.520
and it's hard to pick just one, but what I like about it is you think about the four

05:46.320 --> 05:50.400
first tweets as like a volume one of this Twitter account.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.480
All these happened on May 24th. Yeah.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.800
These, the first four. They said, okay,

05:54.800 --> 05:59.200
I'm bringing back BubbleJug. Great start. Here's some hashtags for the movement. Cool.

05:59.200 --> 06:04.080
And they said, I'm going to get the global community to put their minds to this.

06:04.080 --> 06:08.560
I got to get some attention. Who are some people I know that can help bring back BubbleJug?

06:08.560 --> 06:13.200
Well, Lil Wayne, got it. Okay, Puff Daddy, I'm out. That's it.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.320
Those are the two that I can come up with. Hopefully I'll come up with somebody else soon.

06:16.320 --> 06:20.640
Five days later. What about Griffin? Yeah, got to get Griffin on board.

06:20.640 --> 06:25.120
First of all, BubbleJug one, I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm considering your offer.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.080
I'd love to leave a legacy. I've been listening to a lot of Hamilton,

06:28.080 --> 06:34.400
and that's basically what this is about. Sure. You want something that's going to outlive you.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.520
My sweet, sweet, dusty gum. Your BubbleJuggery.

06:40.480 --> 06:45.120
I would love to read the product details on the candystore.com website.

06:45.120 --> 06:49.440
Untwist the cap to access the candy gum hidden inside. Pour them in your hand

06:49.440 --> 06:53.040
or directly into your mouth to taste deliciously sweet bubble gum flavor.

06:53.040 --> 06:58.240
BubbleJugs are very different from pieces or sticks of gum. Each contains a powder candy.

06:58.240 --> 07:03.200
When chewed, the candy turns into bubble gum. It's almost like having two confections in one.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.520
Eat my asshole, candystore website.

07:10.640 --> 07:16.400
If you first, okay, if I put the dust in my mouth and just thinking about that is like,

07:16.400 --> 07:23.840
like I'm getting like shaky thinking about that sensation of the dust going into the mouth.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.520
The dust, that's the worst part. Once you get, it should say that on the candy store website,

07:27.520 --> 07:31.120
you're going to put the dust in your mouth, but eventually gum will be there where it wasn't.

07:31.120 --> 07:35.520
And like, it's not, it is an imperfect gum delivery mechanism because essentially what

07:35.520 --> 07:40.960
we're talking about is I'm using my mouth to cook the gum up. My mouth is,

07:40.960 --> 07:44.560
my mouth is a little gummy oven. Your mouth, your mouth is the kiln

07:44.560 --> 07:48.720
from which this gum will be fused. I'm Jim Nestle. Lately,

07:48.720 --> 07:53.680
we've noticed that a lot of the sweep-ins left on the old gum making floor have just been going

07:53.680 --> 07:59.680
to waste. Well, I said enough of that. Here's what we do at BubbleJug HQ.

07:59.680 --> 08:05.200
We sweep up all these gum leave-ins. We put them into a jug and then you make the gum.

08:05.200 --> 08:05.520
The jugs-

08:05.520 --> 08:08.720
This is a task we endeavor on together.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.640
The jug's the thing, isn't it?

08:10.640 --> 08:10.800
It is.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.440
Because they couldn't just, they couldn't just make a little bag.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.720
We just sell Ziploc bags full of bubble dust.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.720
Yeah, that would be, that's not, that's not great. So whoever thought of like,

08:20.720 --> 08:26.240
this is the worst idea for anything to ever go into your mouth ever, but somebody was like,

08:26.240 --> 08:29.840
well, if we put it in a fucking jug and we call it BubbleJug and we don't advertise-

08:29.840 --> 08:32.320
Do you think they have the jugs from something else?

08:32.320 --> 08:35.440
They're like, well, we had all these jugs because we were going to do like just

08:35.440 --> 08:39.680
jugs full of chocolate syrup, but like nobody wanted to buy that.

08:39.680 --> 08:45.440
Nobody wanted that because it sounds bad. BubbleJug1, your cause is true.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.520
Your cause is righteous.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.160
So good.

08:48.160 --> 08:53.680
I want you to hang in there. Maybe, and this is just like, I'm not like an expert.

08:53.680 --> 08:59.600
I think like the change.org petitions are like that whole sort of idea is just,

08:59.600 --> 09:04.480
that's not really how the stuff works, but I will say that start, just one good starting

09:04.480 --> 09:07.920
point is to maybe tweet this at the people who made the terrible gum to begin with.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.800
Yeah.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.440
Because they might have the, they are the ones who have their hand

09:11.440 --> 09:15.120
on the assembly line switch to reactivate the bubble gum protocols.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.800
They might be like the guy from the Rockafire Explosion documentary where they're just like

09:18.800 --> 09:22.240
sitting on a warehouse full of BubbleJugs and they don't know what to do with them

09:22.240 --> 09:25.440
because they don't think there's any demand for it. Exactly.

09:25.440 --> 09:31.120
This is, this looks like fleshy sand. This looks like, this looks like what came out of

09:31.120 --> 09:33.600
the mummy in the movie, The Mummy, when he opened his mouth.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.920
It's what's left over if you bake clay face.

09:35.920 --> 09:41.760
If you baked clay face, when you punch a fucking putty right in the old Z

09:41.760 --> 09:46.480
and they disintegrate, they turn into BubbleJug. Fuck this candy.

09:46.480 --> 09:52.160
I hope when you, when you die, you go, when you go to those pearly gates in St. Peter's

09:52.160 --> 09:58.000
there, he's got a pie chart and he makes you go excruciatingly wedge by wedge through how

09:58.000 --> 10:01.840
you spent your life minutes. And with this person, he's going to get to a slice where

10:01.840 --> 10:07.200
he's like, now we come to my tastiest slice of all. This is where you spent your life

10:07.200 --> 10:10.720
minutes making a Twitter account to bring back BubbleJug.

10:10.720 --> 10:15.760
And I gotta tell you, me and the man upstairs, just everybody, we're really big fans of this.

10:15.760 --> 10:23.040
This is, when we made you from like clay and dust and BubbleJug, the one thing we hoped

10:23.040 --> 10:29.200
you guys would really do is invent BubbleJug, cancel BubbleJug, and then try to bring BubbleJug

10:29.200 --> 10:29.600
back.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.520
That was your 40 days in the wilderness was the time without BubbleJug.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.040
Okay. Just, I want to move on cause we've been talking for 10 minutes about it. Long

10:39.040 --> 10:45.040
dead candy. But the day they shut down, the day they flipped the switch on the BubbleJug

10:45.040 --> 10:51.200
factory and then they were like, and everybody left and everybody was sad. There was somebody

10:51.200 --> 10:55.360
left over who had destroyed, had to destroy all the BubbleJug. And you tell me how they

10:55.360 --> 11:00.480
accomplished that. How do you destroy that? Which has been so utterly decimated. And this

11:00.480 --> 11:03.040
is basically gum that has been humiliated.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.400
That was actually what they used in Are You Afraid of the Dark to get the flare ups in

11:06.400 --> 11:08.960
the fire. Not a lot of people know that.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.320
That was powdered coffee creamer.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.760
Well shit.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.480
Okay. Let's do a show.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.040
Here's our first question. This is an advice show, by the way. We take your questions and

11:19.040 --> 11:24.000
turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom. I have a bat flying around my apartment. I've locked

11:24.000 --> 11:29.920
myself in my room, but I need to leave it eventually for work and shit. I figured in

11:29.920 --> 11:32.800
your infinite wisdom, that's pretty sad commentary on our audience that this question

11:32.800 --> 11:35.600
I actually thought that they needed to clarify why they would need to leave their apartment

11:35.600 --> 11:40.800
ever. I figured in your infinite wisdom, you'd be able to tell me how to get, how to rid

11:40.800 --> 11:45.760
my apartment of this befangled nightbird. Please help. That's from Not A Bat Girl.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.760
It's actually befanged nightbird, but I love the term befangled.

11:49.760 --> 11:58.720
That's the way you got all these new, all these new gadget bats, all these new befangled

11:58.720 --> 11:59.600
bats everywhere.

12:01.520 --> 12:10.160
The one time I've had a bat in the house, our dad dressed up like a horseshit Batman

12:10.160 --> 12:16.640
in a windbreaker and a balaclava and like goggles and-

12:16.640 --> 12:17.680
A tennis racket?

12:18.240 --> 12:18.880
Tennis racket.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.520
I thought it was a broom. It might have been a tennis racket.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.680
I think it was dual wielding.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.800
It was dual wielding.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.400
Yeah, that was his spec in college.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.280
He was swinging wildly at this thing, and I don't know if you guys remember what happened

12:31.280 --> 12:40.320
next, but our very old cat Sasha, who was basically on our very last legs at this point, leapt

12:40.320 --> 12:47.280
vertical two feet off the couch, snatched that motherfucker out of the air, and brought

12:47.280 --> 12:51.040
it to its final reward, and the cat took care of it.

12:51.040 --> 12:57.120
So that would be my one first advice would be like to go the Fred Penner route, old lady

12:57.120 --> 13:00.320
swallowed a bat or swallowed a cat to get the bat.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.280
Well, none of us swallowed Sasha after-

13:03.280 --> 13:07.840
Your apartment would swallow a cat that would swallow the bat is what I'm saying.

13:07.840 --> 13:11.520
Now I might get rabies from it is what I know, one thing about it, one problem.

13:12.320 --> 13:16.880
If you think about it, the bat's not very big, and your apartment is probably relatively

13:16.880 --> 13:18.400
large compared to the bat.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.120
Maybe you just have a new shitty roommate.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.720
I've had worse roommates than that.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.880
You know, that's how they measure the square footage.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.200
They don't use that to measure spaces anymore.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.600
It's just if you get on Zillow, it's like this home is 350,000 bats.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.880
It's measured in cubats.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.960
Travis, that's almost a Pokemon.

13:41.200 --> 13:41.840
Better than this.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.120
I'm not.

13:44.080 --> 13:44.560
It's true.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.400
It's a good point.

13:46.400 --> 13:46.800
Thank you.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.120
How do you get rid of a bat?

13:50.880 --> 13:51.440
I really enjoy-

13:51.440 --> 13:52.320
Ask the Joker.

13:55.200 --> 13:55.760
Jesus.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.840
I'm doing a Walker Walker thing, but you can't-

13:57.840 --> 13:58.160
Yeah.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.480
I really enjoy the idea that this person is just huddled in a corner waiting for this

14:02.480 --> 14:07.600
podcast episode to drop, praying that we don't go late for Memorial Day.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.360
Please help love a skeleton.

14:10.240 --> 14:10.880
So hungry.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.800
The bat's not going to hurt you, but that doesn't matter.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.880
I know that the big, big mouse that lives in my garage isn't going to hurt me, but I

14:18.880 --> 14:20.800
am still very afraid of him or her.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.600
Travis, are you a mouse guy?

14:24.320 --> 14:24.800
No.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.080
I love Mouse Hunt with Nathan Lane.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.320
I have a theory that everybody breaks down into mice or spider guys.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.400
Like you're a spider guy or you're a mouse guy or mouse lady or a spider lady.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.240
I vote no on to all.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.280
See, I don't-

14:39.280 --> 14:43.120
Spiders are like not- I don't even- Spiders, I don't trip with spiders.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.080
Like that is- That's fine.

14:44.080 --> 14:44.720
I'll put them on.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.640
I'll get a sheet of construction paper, scoot them onto it, take them out to freedom outside.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.840
That does not bother me.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.080
Mice can fuck right off.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.720
See, for me, I'm just like a- I'm a not a small furry thing that suddenly comes out

14:56.720 --> 14:59.120
of nowhere and moves inhumanly.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.000
So like-

15:00.000 --> 15:00.480
Mice.

15:00.480 --> 15:05.360
Your mice, your spiders, your bats, snakes, lizards?

15:05.360 --> 15:06.000
No problem.

15:06.000 --> 15:06.560
Got nothing.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.120
Borrowers.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.400
No problem. Got nothing.

15:08.400 --> 15:08.900
Borrowers.

15:09.680 --> 15:10.880
Borrowborables.

15:10.880 --> 15:16.240
I watched a giant groundhog out in my yard and I was watching him sort of with novelty

15:16.240 --> 15:18.240
at first because it was like, damn.

15:18.240 --> 15:18.800
Fuck yeah.

15:18.800 --> 15:19.440
That's awesome.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.400
Look at that big groundhog.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.280
Never seen one of these.

15:21.920 --> 15:22.560
This is amazing.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.600
I'm looking at a groundhog.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.640
And then I had a moment where I was like, goddammit, it's a big rat.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.840
And I fucking flipped.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.960
Can you imagine if Justin saw a capybara in the wild?

15:30.960 --> 15:31.680
Holy shit.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.560
Well, he would be fine because he wouldn't get a second alone with that capybara if I

15:36.560 --> 15:37.200
was around.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.000
Don't bother me.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.560
Don't bother me at all to see rodentia in their natural habitat, which is to say not

15:42.560 --> 15:43.200
in my home.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.800
I do not care to see-

15:44.800 --> 15:49.520
Like, I don't care if squirrels are cruising around outside getting those acorns and nuts.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.080
That's fine.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.440
I just don't want it in my home.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.320
You like them when they're doing hard work and preparation.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.880
Every one of God's creatures in their place.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.600
That's all I'm saying.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.120
How do you get rid of a bat?

15:59.120 --> 16:02.160
Here, we've been fucking dancing around this issue and I think I've got it.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.960
You just make a little trail of bananas out the front door and this is a good piece of-

16:06.960 --> 16:08.560
This is like going to be the new-

16:08.560 --> 16:13.360
This is going to be the new pack your bags and move away because there's so many problems

16:13.360 --> 16:16.080
you can solve with just a big trail of bananas.

16:16.080 --> 16:20.640
But going out the front door, you got a roommate you don't like, just banana trap them.

16:20.640 --> 16:26.160
Griffin, I'm sorry, but you're being short-sighted because you're just as likely to draw in a

16:26.160 --> 16:27.280
chimpanzee.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.200
You made a fat landing strip out of bananas.

16:31.200 --> 16:36.000
I was trying to get rid of a bat and I got eight more bats.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.760
Now I got nine bats.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.120
And a monkey.

16:39.120 --> 16:39.840
And a monkey.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.960
A chimpanzee came in.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.600
I've got that scene from Ace Ventura where everything comes out of everywhere.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.280
We got two Dunstons and a fucking- and a Kirk Cameron in here, man.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.160
It's rough stuff.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.440
Kirk Cameron loves bananas.

16:53.440 --> 17:01.920
Now, I would have to say that monkey would temporarily fix your problem because there's

17:01.920 --> 17:04.720
no way a monkey's going to be called a bat cruising his nanas.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.960
I can't get off my nanas.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.160
I would rather have a monkey too because it's easier to keep track of.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.840
It's less likely that I lose sight of a monkey.

17:13.840 --> 17:19.200
But if you do lose sight of that monkey, it's a risk reward scenario.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.960
You lose sight of the bat, then you just have the constant dread of like-

17:22.960 --> 17:25.840
There's a bat somewhere and I don't know.

17:25.840 --> 17:30.000
But if you lose sight of a monkey, it's like, oh my god, this is it.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.920
But that's why I have the motivational poster that says never lose sight of the monkey.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.640
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

17:36.640 --> 17:37.280
I'd love that.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.560
I have a lot of really good ones.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.200
Thank you to everybody who sent in Yahoo's.

17:43.840 --> 17:48.240
If you wouldn't mind, if you could just sort of fucking flood me with your Yahoo's because

17:48.240 --> 17:49.840
we got live shows coming up this weekend.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.240
Yeah, same for regular questions, please.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.760
Yeah, just send those to-

17:54.640 --> 17:55.280
What do we prefer?

17:55.280 --> 17:57.360
My bim bam at maximumfun.org?

17:57.360 --> 17:58.160
Yes, that's fine.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.120
Yeah, I certainly appreciate the help.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.640
All my Yahoo warriors.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.360
This one was sent in by CJ Sights Brown.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.640
It's from Yahoo Answers user Love I who asks,

18:10.080 --> 18:14.800
The backward, misunderstandable line of Work It by Missy Elliott.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.520
I tried a lot to understand.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.280
Listen carefully about the lines in this song, which Missy sings in backwards,

18:23.280 --> 18:27.760
but I wasn't able to understand a thing and all the lyrics website has wrong lyrics.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.360
What does she say when she sings?

18:29.360 --> 18:30.160
Is it worth it?

18:30.160 --> 18:30.960
Let me work it.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.360
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.680
Question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.040
Can I just say how fucking bold it is to be like, I don't know what it is,

18:39.040 --> 18:40.960
but I know that these lyric sites are wrong.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.920
Yeah, well, yeah.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.160
Can anyone, and then if you've got a big elephant noise,

18:48.160 --> 18:51.520
is that the radio edit or is that in the proper dirty cut?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.440
Is it like hog?

18:53.440 --> 18:56.960
If you've got a big, if you've got a big ding-a-ling,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.520
let me search it to find out how hard I gotta work you.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.240
Question mark, question mark.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.400
Can anyone fill out the question mark lines, please?

19:04.400 --> 19:05.840
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.040
Excuse me, Miss Elliott.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.520
Are you proposing that based on the size of my wiener,

19:11.920 --> 19:14.240
you have to work me harder or less?

19:14.240 --> 19:19.920
I don't want to get too blue,

19:19.920 --> 19:22.400
but Miss Elliott, that's simply not how it works.

19:24.080 --> 19:24.720
How big is it?

19:26.080 --> 19:27.520
Clear all, clear my schedule.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.680
He's got a huge, he's got a, he's got a sizable Dumbo.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.480
This is going to take all afternoon.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.280
I actually don't know what is the inverse.

19:37.280 --> 19:41.120
The bigger, the harder, the smaller, the, I don't know, Miss Elliott.

19:41.120 --> 19:41.760
I do not know.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.400
Now, off the top of your head,

19:44.400 --> 19:46.240
do you guys actually know the answer to this?

19:46.240 --> 19:48.800
I mean, it's something, it's whatever the song is in reverse,

19:48.800 --> 19:49.520
but that's not fun.

19:49.520 --> 19:53.360
I think we should give the actual, like, we should actually answer it.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.440
Well, I think maybe we save it until after we do the jokes.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.520
I like to establish the walls.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.840
Okay, and then you let us joke inside of them.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.160
But this is Justin, it would be like a choose your own adventure

20:04.160 --> 20:05.840
in which you said, do you want to go in the cave?

20:05.840 --> 20:07.440
If you do, by the way, you'll die.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.760
Um, I just want to, like, I want to say that this question,

20:11.760 --> 20:16.160
reading it has made me realize that I, when I sing along with this song,

20:16.160 --> 20:18.800
I definitely sing something there.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.040
Like my mouth definitely makes sounds when I'm in the car

20:21.040 --> 20:22.560
and I'm fucking bumping work it.

20:22.560 --> 20:27.040
My mouth, my lyrics are, it's your flippin nippets ran at them.

20:27.040 --> 20:27.440
Yeah.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.000
That's okay.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.240
That's about right, right?

20:30.240 --> 20:33.680
It's yours flippy nippy flam lam yipple is what I do.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.800
It's yours flippy nippy flam lam yipple is what I do.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.680
And so like-

20:37.680 --> 20:39.840
Mine's more like I have a mouth full of peanut butter.

20:39.840 --> 20:44.800
If I were to transcribe that, I'm a lucky individual for several reasons,

20:44.800 --> 20:48.080
but mostly because one of my friends never like stopped the CD

20:48.080 --> 20:52.160
and said, say that again, say that dumb shit.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.120
You just said, it's yours flippy nippy flam lam yipple.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.920
What do you even think you're doing, Griffin?

20:57.920 --> 21:00.880
Words have meetings, actions have consequences.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.440
This is from the same person though, and indeed the same track

21:05.440 --> 21:11.120
that invented basically the phrase badonkadonk and just said it

21:11.120 --> 21:14.960
and just trusted that everybody else would catch up to her level.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.320
Like come on my level.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.080
I'm calling it the badonkadonk now.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.320
Why don't I call my penis my flam lam yipple?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.000
Why didn't that catch on?

21:22.960 --> 21:28.720
I think that that's my favorite thing about any like rap R&B music

21:28.720 --> 21:33.280
is that context is so wonderful that oftentimes people will say stuff

21:33.280 --> 21:35.600
that's like I've never heard.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.400
It's like Shakespeare.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.680
They've never heard the word before, but I definitely know what they meant.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.000
Betwixt my flam lam yipples.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.880
Mine treasure.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.720
I don't think this question has much more legs.

21:46.720 --> 21:47.840
Just wanted to bring it up.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.040
It's an unsolved mystery.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.400
That's a good one.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.440
What do you guys want to do next?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.200
We could talk more about-

21:55.200 --> 21:56.560
I wanna munch squad!

21:56.560 --> 21:58.000
Oh, fucking all right.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.440
I wanna munch squad!

22:01.440 --> 22:03.440
Can we just, have we tracked-

22:03.440 --> 22:08.480
I want to munch squad!

22:08.480 --> 22:09.440
Munch squad!

22:09.440 --> 22:12.160
Have we tracked the engagement on munch squad?

22:12.160 --> 22:14.800
Cause like, listen, I'm a fan of munch squad, Justin.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.040
The food, the jokes, it's great.

22:17.040 --> 22:17.680
It's hilarious.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.640
Me and my kids, they love it.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.240
I just want to make sure that when we introduce a new segment

22:22.240 --> 22:24.240
and maybe this can be what I bring to munch squad

22:24.240 --> 22:26.640
is I just want to make sure we've got the metrics

22:26.640 --> 22:28.560
and we're tracking it and we're responsive.

22:28.560 --> 22:32.400
I definitely, most of this right now, just tweet about munch squad.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.000
I haven't really gotten anybody tweet-

22:34.000 --> 22:36.400
What I was kind of hoping for, people would be like,

22:36.400 --> 22:38.080
here's a candidate for the squad.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.160
And I'd be like, you mean the munch squad?

22:40.160 --> 22:41.760
It's a little early to be shortening it.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.880
It took me a long time to call it.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.080
Shouldn't it be munch punch?

22:45.200 --> 22:45.440
No.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.320
No, that's a cereal.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.360
Get the fuck out of here.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.160
See, that's why I'm here.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.600
If you called it munch a bunch,

22:49.600 --> 22:51.040
this is gonna be dead on the vine.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.720
Cause munch is the cereal thing.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.360
I'm confused.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.280
So when I'm confused by something, I hate it.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.440
Okay, everybody hop in the car.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.240
Okay.

22:58.240 --> 22:58.880
With me.

22:58.880 --> 23:02.560
We're gonna drive on down route 10,

23:02.560 --> 23:04.240
go past the new Huntington high school.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.320
We're gonna turn right here, past the marathon.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.800
And if you see the Arby's, you've gone too far

23:10.800 --> 23:12.400
cause we're pulling into Wendy's.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.280
Oh God.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.880
I thought we were going to Bob Evans there for a second.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.680
I got worried.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.240
No, no, no.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.760
That's over in kinetic park to the left.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.600
We going to the world's last Ponderosa?

23:20.240 --> 23:21.840
No, that's over on route 60, Travis.

23:21.840 --> 23:22.000
Come on.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.040
Oh, sorry.

23:23.040 --> 23:27.760
We're going to Wendy's for a new treat

23:27.760 --> 23:30.720
called the limited edition bacon mozzarella burger.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.600
Now what, as you know, on Munch Squad,

23:33.600 --> 23:36.320
we're not really interested with the feedback on a product.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.560
We're kind of more interested in what the experts

23:38.560 --> 23:39.920
who create these products have to say.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.000
So I, here I got two,

23:47.040 --> 23:49.280
I got two paragraphs for the press release.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.520
This just dropped May 24th.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.240
So this is like hot off the presses, off the PR news wire.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.320
And they cook them on the same grill

23:56.320 --> 23:58.240
as those delicious Wendy's burgers.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.520
This is literally, these two are verbatim.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.520
Wendy's just shocked fans by dropping its previously,

24:05.520 --> 24:06.400
I know.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.920
What the fuck is this?

24:08.800 --> 24:09.360
Wendy's just-

24:09.360 --> 24:10.480
Oh no, no Wendy's.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.920
No, not like this.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.680
Just shocked its fans by dropping

24:13.680 --> 24:16.240
its previously unannounced limited edition

24:16.240 --> 24:17.360
bacon mozzarella burger.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.200
You're not Beyonce.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.880
This is not Lemonade.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.880
Video experience on HBO.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.360
What is sure to be a chop topper, chart topper

24:27.360 --> 24:28.480
on its long list of hits.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.840
A chomp topper.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.880
A chomp topper.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.480
All those hits.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.520
This is gonna fly straight up the iTunes burger charts.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.360
I'm gonna tell you guys about the burger

24:37.360 --> 24:39.120
and then we'll get a quote from Kurt Cain,

24:39.120 --> 24:41.280
Wendy's chief concept and marketing officer.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.240
The masterpiece plays tribute to Wendy's biggest

24:44.240 --> 24:46.640
and most classic stars like thick cut applewoods

24:46.640 --> 24:50.320
with bacon and fresh, never frozen North American beef.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.040
Quick side note, just for legal reasons,

24:53.920 --> 24:55.760
should be noted that fresh beef is available

24:55.760 --> 24:58.640
in the contiguous U.S. and Canada.

24:58.640 --> 25:02.080
So sorry about your luck, Hawaii and Alaska.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.360
You're getting that old shit.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.480
However, Wendy's bacon-

25:06.480 --> 25:07.600
That aged beef.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.720
That aged beef, classic aged, always frozen.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.400
However, Wendy's bacon mozzarella burger

25:12.400 --> 25:14.640
puts a new spin on things by collaborating

25:14.640 --> 25:16.080
with flavors such as creamy.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.080
What?

25:18.080 --> 25:18.580
What?

25:20.320 --> 25:21.840
You know, that creamy flavor.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.800
With creamy sweet notes of natural mozzarella cheese.

25:24.800 --> 25:25.840
Mozzarella.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.200
This harmonizes a sliced red onions, spring mix

25:29.200 --> 25:32.080
and a garlic Parmesan cheese spread all tied together.

25:32.080 --> 25:32.880
I know what you're thinking.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.720
Man, I really like the cheese on this burger.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.240
Can we get a cheese spread on here too?

25:36.240 --> 25:37.440
Indeed you can.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.920
All tied together with toasted garlic brioche bun.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.800
The burger redefines the genre we all thought we knew

25:43.680 --> 25:46.080
and this hit is only available for a limited time.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.360
So in the two things, first thing

25:49.360 --> 25:52.000
is that in the like marketing of this product

25:52.000 --> 25:54.160
there's some key art here

25:56.080 --> 25:59.840
that is supposed to advertise this product.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.080
And for some reason, continuing with this

26:02.640 --> 26:05.920
frankly insane theme that they've created

26:05.920 --> 26:08.400
they have made the key art for this product

26:08.960 --> 26:11.840
look like a CD case.

26:11.840 --> 26:15.440
This CD case actually has-

26:15.440 --> 26:18.400
Okay, so then this has to be,

26:18.400 --> 26:20.400
like the language that they've used

26:20.400 --> 26:23.360
has to be like a Beyonce lemonade goof, right?

26:23.360 --> 26:24.240
Oh God, yes.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.560
So Travis, I've sent you a link to this product.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.400
If you could just dip right in there

26:30.400 --> 26:32.080
and give me some of the track list.

26:32.080 --> 26:35.760
I fucking absolutely can't.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.640
I disassociate-

26:36.640 --> 26:40.080
Do not Justin, please let us not jump ahead

26:40.080 --> 26:42.880
from the taste bud advisory

26:42.880 --> 26:46.640
delicious ingredients indicator on the CD

26:46.640 --> 26:48.080
just to let you know just in case.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.440
Track number one.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.120
Track number one is what, Travis?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.240
Good buns, hon.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.160
Parentheses, intro, parentheses.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.280
Performed by garlic brioche bun

27:01.280 --> 27:03.040
and written by That's Soft Taste.

27:03.040 --> 27:10.160
Hit it, hit it, hit it, garlic brioche bun.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.080
Is this that new That's Soft Taste track?

27:12.720 --> 27:13.680
Is this Sia?

27:13.680 --> 27:16.400
No, it's That's Soft Taste.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.480
Track number two, Travis, what is it?

27:18.480 --> 27:19.520
Spread it on.

27:19.520 --> 27:22.400
Performed by garlic parmesan cheese spread

27:23.040 --> 27:24.880
written by The Condiments.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.080
Now I would like to point out

27:26.080 --> 27:28.560
it's just occurred to me that this is like

27:28.560 --> 27:30.320
and now that's what I call music

27:30.320 --> 27:32.400
a burger compilation CD

27:32.400 --> 27:35.280
because these are all different artists and writers.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.760
The third is Tears of Joy

27:37.760 --> 27:40.880
performed by Red Onion written by Mother Nature.

27:42.080 --> 27:46.000
Show me fucking like a painting of Mother Gaia

27:46.560 --> 27:48.400
floating over a Wendy's like,

27:48.400 --> 27:50.800
oh yes, y'all heard my mixtape?

27:50.800 --> 27:51.840
It is fire.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.440
Travis, what's that fourth track?

27:53.440 --> 27:55.200
So Fresh and So Green.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.160
Somebody spent a long time designing this CD thing.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.520
I, Garen, fucking tee you.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.560
We are the only people to ever do a deep dive

28:06.560 --> 28:08.000
into the track list of this burger.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.120
Yeah, whoever wrote this is like,

28:09.120 --> 28:10.560
nobody's fucking reading this shit.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.080
I just want to get out of here, it's Friday.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.840
A Gooey performed by mozzarella cheese

28:15.840 --> 28:16.960
and written by All Natural.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.080
Oh, Justin, you skipped That Oven Lovin,

28:20.080 --> 28:22.960
a terrifying, terrifying term.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.520
Now, is that the one performed by Applewood Smoked Bacon?

28:25.520 --> 28:26.560
I love their shit.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.000
Written by The Thick Cuts?

28:28.000 --> 28:28.480
It is.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.440
Yeah, The Thick Cuts.

28:29.440 --> 28:33.440
Track number seven is We Can't Freeze, We Won't Freeze.

28:33.440 --> 28:34.960
Performed by North American Beef.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.120
Written by 100% Fresh Never Frozen.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.480
And then there is, just in this fucking-

28:40.480 --> 28:43.680
Hell, they're on some outcast shit.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.520
They definitely do have the asterisk there

28:45.520 --> 28:49.680
to reiterate that 100% Fresh Never Frozen Beef

28:49.680 --> 28:53.040
is only available in the contiguous U.S. and Canada.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.000
Just super want to make it super duper clear.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Even on this dumb ass track list,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.480
they definitely, Alaska and Hawaii are still fucked.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.080
And then, yeah, so what you don't see on here

29:04.080 --> 29:06.960
is there's the three BurgerTime,

29:06.960 --> 29:08.960
just the skits that they do in there,

29:08.960 --> 29:10.080
just like break things up,

29:10.080 --> 29:11.440
add a little bit of narrative to this evening.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.240
Yeah, some fun.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.400
They got Chris Tucker to come out

29:14.400 --> 29:16.080
and just like do some skits with them.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.080
And there's a Good Buns outro,

29:20.720 --> 29:22.720
but it was also written by That Soft Taste,

29:22.720 --> 29:24.480
kind of aping his own shit.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.960
Here's the quote from Kurt Kane,

29:26.960 --> 29:30.480
the bacon mozzarella is a cheeseburger lover's dream.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.360
From the first bite, this combination of fresh beef

29:33.360 --> 29:35.920
and oven-cooked bacon paired with melty mozzarella

29:35.920 --> 29:38.320
and garlic Parmesan cheese spread

29:38.320 --> 29:40.480
creates a deliciously unforgettable burger.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.080
Kurt's work here is a little underwhelming.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.720
I'd like him to get with the whole pastiche.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.160
Hey, Kurt, can I talk to you real quick?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.040
Do you have a second?

29:49.040 --> 29:50.080
Yeah, what is it, Dave?

29:51.840 --> 29:53.280
I read your quote.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.080
It's lovely.

29:54.080 --> 29:54.880
It's great.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.760
It's great, we're kind of doing a whole like,

29:57.760 --> 30:00.320
we're dropping the, it's like a Beyonce thing,

30:00.320 --> 30:02.000
like with the album and the thing.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.720
Could you fucking get on board for one second, Kurt?

30:05.440 --> 30:06.720
Kurt's original quote was like,

30:08.480 --> 30:09.760
I didn't want to do any of this.

30:10.640 --> 30:14.720
It's a fucking burger with cheese and bacon on it.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.560
Is your mind blown, America?

30:17.200 --> 30:18.400
You've got what now?

30:20.480 --> 30:22.320
Reinventing the genre.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.800
They are, in fact, they say it.

30:25.520 --> 30:26.880
They say they're doing that.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.800
They're doing that, they say it.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.560
Hi, this is McDonald talking to help you.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.320
Hi, I just wanted to tell you,

30:33.120 --> 30:34.400
I need you to take all the burgers

30:34.400 --> 30:35.840
that you've already made in there

30:35.840 --> 30:37.840
and put them in the fucking garbage can

30:38.560 --> 30:40.640
because Wendy's just blew up the fucking game.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.560
You never even thought about putting bacon

30:42.560 --> 30:43.680
and cheese on your burger.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.800
But we do this, goodbye.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.200
Hey, it's Ronald, it's Ron, shut it all down.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.840
Shut it all down, we're fucking idiots.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.400
Throw it out with the bubble jug, set it on fire.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.960
We're done with all the dumb ass burgers we were making.

30:56.960 --> 30:57.840
What were we thinking?

30:57.840 --> 30:58.880
I'm so embarrassed.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.640
Someone made this.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.480
It does look good though.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.800
I mean, it looks like an all right burger.

31:06.800 --> 31:10.720
I think maybe for, this was very good PR, obviously.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.200
Sure, it got us talking.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.760
I feel like the first episode of Munch Squad

31:15.760 --> 31:18.320
really got me into the idea of foods

31:18.320 --> 31:21.280
that would definitely kill a dog or a child

31:21.280 --> 31:22.480
if they got their hands on it.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.880
And I don't think this burger would do the job

31:24.880 --> 31:27.120
as much as a fried chicken taco would.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.200
Although I don't know, there is a lot of mozzarella on here.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.320
There's a lot of mozzarella in the sauce on there too.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.600
It's like a lot of levels.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.600
Is that how it is groundbreaking?

31:38.720 --> 31:40.880
When you're coming up with a mozzarella based recipe,

31:40.880 --> 31:43.040
is there a number that represents

31:43.040 --> 31:44.720
how much fresh mootz goes on it?

31:44.720 --> 31:48.800
And then that number, the scale is like one to six.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.480
And then Wendy's like, we need a new burger.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.320
And it's like, well, what if we just took the mootz scale

31:52.320 --> 31:53.680
and just like threw it the fuck away

31:53.680 --> 31:55.680
and we did like 15 or 16?

31:55.680 --> 31:57.120
They're like, that would change the game.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.280
Cause I am looking on this and it is a gooey baby.

31:59.840 --> 32:00.960
That's the ninth track.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.280
I went to Wendy's Facebook page

32:03.280 --> 32:05.040
to see if I could find some more information

32:05.040 --> 32:06.640
about this fucking jam.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.720
And it's literally all yoga videos.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.080
I don't really know what they're doing.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.000
It's just pictures that their fans have posted

32:14.000 --> 32:16.240
and it's just their skeletal bodies

32:16.240 --> 32:17.360
after they ate one of these

32:17.360 --> 32:19.520
and were probably just completely destroyed

32:19.520 --> 32:21.120
by how mind blowing.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.280
Oh my God, they've done it.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.600
I'm gonna call Wendy's right now and congratulate them.

32:28.400 --> 32:40.400
Okay, so let's hear what he said.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.560
You know what pairs really well

32:42.560 --> 32:44.560
with a Wendy's mozzarella burger?

32:46.480 --> 32:48.160
No, Trav, I'm not quite sure.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.400
Neither do I, Justin, cause it's groundbreaking.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.360
I've never had it.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.040
But you know who does?

32:53.600 --> 32:53.920
What?

32:54.480 --> 32:56.880
What goes well with 13 pounds of mozzarella?

32:57.840 --> 32:59.440
I'll tell you who does know.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.080
Club W.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.560
They pair shit with shit.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.920
All the, mostly wine.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.520
I don't think they're pairing other stuff.

33:06.080 --> 33:06.800
But maybe they do.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.720
Maybe in their free time on the off hours

33:08.720 --> 33:10.640
they're just pairing stuff with stuff.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.320
They're like, you know what hand towels

33:12.320 --> 33:14.000
go with what combat boots?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.200
Club W knows.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.280
They're just nose arcing their way

33:17.280 --> 33:18.640
through all of existence.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.240
They're just, they ship every character

33:20.240 --> 33:21.680
they see on every television show.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.800
And they ship every, they're like,

33:25.360 --> 33:27.680
I don't know, like Converse All Stars

33:27.680 --> 33:30.640
pair great with a compound bow.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.040
I don't know if they do it, not me.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.160
And how do they do that?

33:34.160 --> 33:36.240
Well, you would think like a wine club,

33:36.240 --> 33:37.520
a wine shipment thing.

33:37.520 --> 33:39.440
They must ask me like, do you like Rose?

33:39.440 --> 33:40.400
Do you like Chardonnay?

33:40.400 --> 33:41.840
What kind of kind of wine?

33:41.840 --> 33:43.360
No, what they do is it's genius.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.200
They have a very simple questionnaire.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.440
Stuff like, do you prefer chocolate or vanilla?

33:47.440 --> 33:48.160
That kind of thing.

33:48.160 --> 33:48.960
Do you like salty?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.320
Do you like sweet?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.080
And through that, they're able to determine

33:52.080 --> 33:54.800
your preferences and make recommendations for wine.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.560
Then that wine is shipped to you.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.120
And this is like fancy looking,

33:59.120 --> 34:01.200
incredibly like classy shit

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
that makes you look like you know what you're doing.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.080
Even though, let's be honest, you do not.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.640
And they come with cards that like tell you

34:08.640 --> 34:10.640
all about the wine, what it pairs with,

34:10.640 --> 34:12.240
when it's a good time to drink it.

34:12.240 --> 34:13.600
So you can memorize all that.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.800
And then when your friends come over,

34:14.800 --> 34:16.560
you're like, hey, do you like that wine?

34:16.560 --> 34:19.120
I know it's really great with this chicken mark pizza.

34:19.120 --> 34:19.680
I know.

34:20.640 --> 34:22.080
And then you can act like you knew it

34:22.080 --> 34:23.040
off the top of your head.

34:24.320 --> 34:27.200
And it's relatively affordable.

34:27.200 --> 34:29.120
Justin, please tell them how affordable

34:29.120 --> 34:30.160
and wonderful it is.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.560
Or right now, Club W is offering our listeners

34:32.560 --> 34:34.240
$20 off your first order when you go

34:34.240 --> 34:37.520

34:37.520 --> 34:41.360
Again, go to clubw.com slash my brother

34:41.360 --> 34:44.560

34:44.560 --> 34:46.720
And Club W will actually pay for shipping.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.800
They're shipping beloved characters.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.240
They're also shipping wine, and they'll pay for it

34:52.240 --> 34:54.960
on orders of four bottles or more.

34:54.960 --> 34:59.520
That address, again, is clubw.com slash my brother.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.120
Just real quick, I went down a Google hole

35:03.120 --> 35:04.080
because I brought up shipping.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.120
And I just couldn't, I like it.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.880
For some reason, I had this flash thought in my head

35:06.880 --> 35:10.560
of is there like a Tumblr community of people

35:10.560 --> 35:12.240
who ship Frasier characters?

35:12.240 --> 35:15.840
And the answer is there isn't, there's not.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.840
I don't believe you, Griffin.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.240
You don't believe me that there isn't?

35:20.240 --> 35:21.680
I mean, there is one now, because I just like,

35:21.680 --> 35:23.680
I feel like I just breathed it into existence.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.680
But just like, I searched, I actually searched

35:25.680 --> 35:27.920
Frasier shipping Niles slash G.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.000
I would do Niles and Ross.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.720
Like, I just feel like there was something there.

35:32.720 --> 35:33.120
You know?

35:33.120 --> 35:34.240
Who's Ross?

35:34.240 --> 35:36.080
Do you mean Ross, idiot?

35:36.080 --> 35:37.760
No, Ross, you fucking idiot.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.920
No, I mean Ross from friends.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.880
I just felt like there was something.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.880
Do you remember the famous Frasier friends

35:44.880 --> 35:45.840
crossover episode?

35:48.240 --> 35:53.280
Nationwide obsession was whether or not Ross from friends

35:53.280 --> 35:54.640
and Frasier were gonna fuck.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.720
And the producers of the shows were like,

35:56.720 --> 35:57.840
this is never happening.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.440
Why are you people so obsessed with this?

36:00.880 --> 36:02.560
I'm not even sure they're on the same network.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.840
The episode was 15 seconds long, a wormhole opened up

36:07.840 --> 36:10.480
and sucked them both into a single room.

36:10.480 --> 36:12.880
And then Ross walked up to Frasier and he just went,

36:12.880 --> 36:14.560
I don't want to fuck you.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.560
And then bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.840
And put in side belt theme.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.760
I don't want to fuck you either.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.480
I want to tell you about some underwear

36:34.480 --> 36:35.200
I'm wearing right now.

36:35.200 --> 36:42.000
They are me undies and you just can't stop thinking about.

36:43.040 --> 36:46.160
Hi, is this people magazine?

36:46.720 --> 36:47.520
Yes, it is.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.240
Hi, this is David Crane, creator of friends.

36:50.240 --> 36:53.840
Could you do me a favor and please stop putting pictures

36:53.840 --> 36:58.080
of Ross from our show and Frasier on the cover of your magazine

36:58.080 --> 37:00.640
with a big question mark and pictures of kisses

37:00.640 --> 37:02.080
because it's not happening.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.280
I'm really, I'm over it.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.400
We're all really over it.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.440
It's not happening.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.800
I don't know how this got started.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.680
It's never happening.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.960
Hi, it's me, David Angel.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.680
Could you keep putting creator of Frasier,

37:13.680 --> 37:16.160
could you keep putting those pictures on?

37:16.160 --> 37:18.800
Is doing gangbusters for our ratings.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.080
Thank you so much.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.080
That's explains everybody's watching Frasier

37:22.080 --> 37:25.440
because they kept watching for Ross to show up and fuck him.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.480
Everyone's favorite friend, Ross, is he going to be on here?

37:29.760 --> 37:31.920
It's the new will they, won't they, can they?

37:31.920 --> 37:34.560
Because of the dimensions.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.560
Well, because they're two men, Justin.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.280
You're unfucking believable.

37:40.160 --> 37:40.960
I have a sponsor here.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.080
It's me undies.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.000
And it's underwear I'm literally wearing right now

37:44.000 --> 37:44.960
because they're the most comfortable,

37:44.960 --> 37:46.640
most wonderful underwear in the universe.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.440
They are soft.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.720
They breathe real nice.

37:50.720 --> 37:51.840
I was on a plane today.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.520
I try to wear them on a plane whenever I can

37:53.520 --> 37:55.920
because they just like, they don't bunch up and get all yucky.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.520
It's made from a sustainably sourced modal fabric

37:59.520 --> 38:01.040
that's twice as soft as cotton.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.880
Just nothing can describe how good they feel.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.280
Me undies is dedicated to providing

38:05.280 --> 38:06.640
the world's most comfortable underwear.

38:08.800 --> 38:09.520
No questions asked.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.840
Me undies has dozens of styles and limited edition prints

38:11.840 --> 38:14.080
to help you make a statement with your underwear,

38:14.080 --> 38:15.360
whether anyone can see them or not.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.640

38:32.640 --> 38:35.440
I guarantee you, you will not regret

38:35.440 --> 38:37.120
getting these underwear and putting them on your body.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.360
I have got a jumbo charm message

38:39.360 --> 38:42.000
and it's for Mike and Allie or Mallie,

38:42.000 --> 38:43.440
as I like to call them.

38:43.440 --> 38:44.880
And it's from Chris.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.600
And Chris says, to my dearest friends,

38:47.600 --> 38:50.320
you have been my closest friends for over 10 years now.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.800
And I want to congratulate you on your nuptials

38:52.800 --> 38:55.600
with the help of the dulcet tones of the McElroy brothers.

38:55.600 --> 38:59.840
From our times in Peterborough at PR 13,

38:59.840 --> 39:01.680
was that like their training camp?

39:01.680 --> 39:04.160
To Toronto and everywhere else,

39:04.160 --> 39:05.680
thank you for being a friend

39:05.680 --> 39:07.680
and for letting me be a part of your lives

39:07.680 --> 39:08.480
and your wedding.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.080
That sounds nice.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.760
What is PR 13, you guys?

39:13.760 --> 39:17.120
It's definitely some sort of secret underground laboratory.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.800
Maybe a public school, probably?

39:18.800 --> 39:20.880
No, no, it's definitely-

39:20.880 --> 39:22.160
Then it would be called like

39:22.160 --> 39:25.760
the Alexander Hamilton School for the Gifted.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.840
Okay, that's true, probably true.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.960
I think they were developing the Andromeda strain.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.560
And fucking, you ever look up in the sky

39:34.560 --> 39:37.920
and you see those white like straight lines up there?

39:37.920 --> 39:39.440
Those are called chemtrails, you guys.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.400
And they're no joke.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.760
They're serious business.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.480
What do they do?

39:45.680 --> 39:47.120
Exactly, what do they do?

39:48.080 --> 39:50.800
I think Chris, Mike, and Allie owe us an explanation.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.320
What are you hiding?

39:52.960 --> 39:55.200
What are you hiding, Chris, Mike, and Allie?

39:55.200 --> 39:57.280
And what aren't you hiding?

39:57.280 --> 40:00.000
I've got a message here for Cade and it's from Grace.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.480
And Grace says to Cade,

40:02.480 --> 40:05.120
happy birthday, wishing you a steady flow of creative energy

40:05.120 --> 40:06.240
and drive this year.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.320
Thank you for being a wonderful partner and housemate

40:08.320 --> 40:10.720
and for introducing me to the McElroy family of products.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.240
I love you and so does the cat,

40:12.240 --> 40:14.400
to whatever extent a cat can feel love.

40:14.400 --> 40:15.360
So not very much.

40:16.160 --> 40:16.880
I like that.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.000
I like that they said that like as much as the cat can,

40:20.000 --> 40:23.200
it is, like we're not gonna say that the cat's not feeling love.

40:23.200 --> 40:27.280
We just don't know what level of love the cat might be feeling.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.560
They need a flow of creative energy and drive.

40:30.560 --> 40:35.600
We're gonna give them that blockbuster million dollar idea right now.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.520
Griffin, say any word, go.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.280
Jungle?

40:39.280 --> 40:40.800
Now Justin, say a word.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.840
Please say two.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.000
No, okay, Jungle Bungle's very good, damn it.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.640
Okay, Jungle Bungle pants, go.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.240
Oh no, you shouldn't have added the pants to it.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.680
Jungle Bungle was perfect, Travis.

40:49.680 --> 40:50.560
Jungle Bungle's great.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.120
But then we don't each get to say a word.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.040
You can't take my ability to say a word.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.760
Travis, listen, just put an exclamation point there.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.520
Okay, yeah, Jungle Bungle 2.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.680
The sequel to Jungle to Jungle,

41:03.680 --> 41:06.160
which I know it's fucking confusing, guys, Hollywood.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.520
Because the two was already in there.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.040
What the fuck, Jungle to Jungle?

41:10.160 --> 41:12.320
Jungle Bungle exclamation point three.

41:12.320 --> 41:15.200
The second Jungle to Jungle movie starring Tim Allen again.

41:15.200 --> 41:20.720
Oh, I got a message for you, the listener.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.440
And it's about the Useless Majors,

41:23.440 --> 41:25.760
which is a scripted narrative podcast

41:25.760 --> 41:27.680
following a group of recent college graduates

41:27.680 --> 41:31.280
who, after an accident involving radioactive diplomas,

41:31.280 --> 41:33.440
receive superpowers based on their majors.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.200
That's a fucking good idea for a thing.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.640
It's a great fucking premise.

41:36.640 --> 41:39.760
I'll just, Kate, take that, do that one.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.000
As evil forces conspire to take over the world,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
our heroes have found themselves working at the mall

41:44.000 --> 41:46.720
with the help of robots, which is ghosts of US presidents

41:46.720 --> 41:48.480
and other crazy characters.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.920
Can our heroes save the day?

41:50.480 --> 41:52.400
That's good, that puts suspense right in there.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.800
And you could subscribe to the Useless Majors podcast

41:54.800 --> 41:59.440
on iTunes, or you can go to uselessmajors.com

42:00.080 --> 42:02.400
and you can subscribe there.

42:03.680 --> 42:07.760
And it looks like they're on their ninth episode over there,

42:07.760 --> 42:13.840
so it's not too late to catch up and go do it.

42:13.840 --> 42:16.080
Go for it, check it out, the Useless Majors.

42:16.080 --> 42:20.720
What would my superpower be, journalism-ing?

42:20.720 --> 42:22.880
You'd be able to find the truth in all things.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.200
Oh, fuck, that would be good.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.000
Yeah.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.960
But also I would wear shorts but suit tops

42:30.960 --> 42:32.400
and I would be kind of a jag.

42:34.080 --> 42:38.560
I have a drama degrees, or an acting and directing degree,

42:38.560 --> 42:42.080
so my superpower would be to live in my parents' house

42:42.080 --> 42:44.240
for a few months, just so I can figure some things out.

42:44.240 --> 42:44.740
Yep.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.400
You'd be like Rogue, because you'd get

42:48.400 --> 42:50.400
a different superpower eventually.

42:50.400 --> 42:56.160
Your superpower as an acting major would be,

42:56.160 --> 42:58.240
you eventually would change to a different superpower.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.080
Is the superpower to have another superpower

43:00.080 --> 43:02.720
but keep telling people about the superpower you used to do?

43:04.480 --> 43:05.760
For free now?

43:06.320 --> 43:07.840
You're like Phoenix, you're like Jean Grey,

43:07.840 --> 43:09.360
you transform at some point.

43:09.360 --> 43:13.680
I summon ice crystals from thin air now,

43:13.680 --> 43:17.040
kind of just for me, at a more personal level.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.040
In the community?

43:19.040 --> 43:21.280
I got out in the community, I kind of got out

43:21.280 --> 43:23.760
of the rat race with that power.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.040
By which I mean fighting the race of rat men

43:27.040 --> 43:30.240
that I used to battle, but I wasn't making any money off of it.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.280
You know, you know that whole thing.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.480
You know, you know how it goes.

43:32.480 --> 43:35.440
I recently achieved a pretty major adult milestone,

43:35.440 --> 43:37.360
moving into my first apartment.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.600
I'm lucky enough to have a job that allows me to live alone,

43:39.600 --> 43:41.200
and that has been, quite possibly,

43:41.200 --> 43:43.200
the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.000
The only problem is my mother, who lives in the same city

43:46.000 --> 43:47.440
and wants me to give her a key.

43:47.440 --> 43:50.000
Ooh, I have no real reason to say no.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.640
The landlord said I could make as many copies as I want,

43:52.640 --> 43:54.720
and I don't have a roommate whose privacy I must preserve,

43:54.720 --> 43:56.160
but I really want to say no.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.560
I feel like in giving my mother a key,

43:58.560 --> 44:00.800
I'll be losing some of my newfound independence.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.640
Does this make me a terrible daughter?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.560
Should I give her a key and suck it up?

44:04.560 --> 44:06.560
Or if I say no, how do I say no?

44:06.560 --> 44:08.160
Help from Caitlin, huh?

44:09.040 --> 44:12.320
The implication, I think, if you give your mom a key,

44:12.320 --> 44:14.000
I mean, the implication of that is like,

44:14.000 --> 44:18.240
I at any point want you there when I am not, right?

44:18.240 --> 44:18.800
I mean, that's-

44:18.800 --> 44:19.040
Yeah.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.120
Not necessarily, no.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.200
Well, not to rush it, but I feel like Caitlin,

44:23.200 --> 44:26.240
like, you need to achieve a second adult milestone,

44:26.240 --> 44:28.800
and that is to be direct with a parent.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.040
Yeah.

44:29.040 --> 44:30.400
And like, if you give her a key,

44:30.400 --> 44:32.160
you have to say like, I'm giving you this,

44:32.160 --> 44:34.640
but this is for emergencies only.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.960
It's not like you're gonna fucking get home from work

44:36.960 --> 44:38.960
and go to open up a cold soda and be like,

44:38.960 --> 44:40.800
oh no, my mom came over and drank it all.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.400
Like, I don't think that's what's gonna,

44:43.120 --> 44:45.360
she'll probably call, you know?

44:46.640 --> 44:47.440
I don't know, Griffin,

44:47.440 --> 44:49.120
because I would feel like if that was the case,

44:49.120 --> 44:50.720
Caitlin wouldn't be worried about it.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.160
The very fact that Caitlin felt the need to like,

44:54.160 --> 44:56.160
write in and ask us about it,

44:56.160 --> 44:58.800
implies to me that there's at least some doubt in her mind

44:58.800 --> 45:01.120
that her mom will not understand the boundaries

45:01.120 --> 45:03.520
and will see it as like an extension of the house

45:03.520 --> 45:04.720
that they lived in together.

45:05.440 --> 45:06.720
The fact that you, yeah,

45:06.720 --> 45:09.120
I guess the fact that you like have to think about this,

45:09.120 --> 45:14.800
like you gotta, a door is a good boundary,

45:14.800 --> 45:16.480
a locked door has a good boundary,

45:16.480 --> 45:18.560
but there's better ones you can establish

45:19.200 --> 45:27.600
sort of in the immaterial space in your relationship.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.040
And those are also very important boundaries,

45:31.040 --> 45:34.560
but don't lock those up, I've been Dr. Phil.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.680
I think that's why saying something on lines of like,

45:37.680 --> 45:39.680
this is for emergencies only,

45:39.680 --> 45:42.240
and then if she abuses that, you can say,

45:42.240 --> 45:45.680
I told you that that's an invasion of my privacy, mob,

45:45.680 --> 45:47.840
like I told you that this was for emergencies only,

45:47.840 --> 45:49.040
please don't abuse it.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.080
But if you aren't direct up front,

45:52.080 --> 45:55.040
you don't have any case later, you know what I mean?

45:55.040 --> 45:57.200
You have to say like, I'm giving you this,

45:57.200 --> 45:59.440
but like, it's for emergencies only, okay?

45:59.440 --> 46:02.000
This is silly though, this is silly though.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.480
Cause like, if you're worried about your mom

46:06.480 --> 46:09.680
like just dropping in, she doesn't really need a key,

46:10.800 --> 46:13.280
cause your mom is an international jewel thief

46:13.280 --> 46:14.400
and cat burglar.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.480
No, she'll just like come over,

46:16.480 --> 46:18.320
it's like knock on the door and he'd be like,

46:18.320 --> 46:19.920
no, I don't want you to come in.

46:20.480 --> 46:20.880
Like that's not how-

46:20.880 --> 46:22.000
That's an excellent point.

46:22.560 --> 46:24.720
Yeah, the key is not the thing.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.720
If your fear is in doing it,

46:26.720 --> 46:30.240
just like you giving her a key is somehow giving up.

46:30.240 --> 46:31.520
So let me tell you someone who's lived

46:31.520 --> 46:32.880
in a lot of apartments,

46:32.880 --> 46:35.600
I'm always glad when someone has an extra key.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.440
When I lose my key or lock myself out

46:37.440 --> 46:39.760
or I need someone to like go take care of something

46:39.760 --> 46:40.960
when I'm like out of town.

46:42.640 --> 46:45.760
My mother-in-law didn't have a key to our house for a while

46:45.760 --> 46:48.560
and then when we needed her to feed our cats,

46:48.560 --> 46:50.400
cause we got a flight canceled or something,

46:50.400 --> 46:52.480
she ended up having to shove turkey slices

46:52.480 --> 46:53.760
through the mail slot,

46:53.760 --> 46:55.360
which is not great for cats.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.360
She never stopped.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.360
She's still doing it to this day.

46:59.360 --> 47:03.600
You've ruined the idea of the mailman to your cat.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.360
Every time your cat hears the mail come in,

47:05.360 --> 47:08.080
it's like, oh boy, another turkey delivery for me.

47:08.080 --> 47:08.800
Oh hell yeah.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.480
I have a fucking good answer to this, you guys.

47:12.480 --> 47:13.120
You ready?

47:13.120 --> 47:13.760
Yes.

47:13.760 --> 47:14.480
You're gonna love this.

47:15.360 --> 47:15.920
Fake key.

47:17.200 --> 47:20.480
Jesus, give her a key that doesn't work in the lock

47:20.480 --> 47:24.880
and then if she tries to break into your house

47:24.880 --> 47:26.240
when you don't want her there,

47:26.240 --> 47:27.440
she'll have to say to you,

47:27.440 --> 47:28.480
hey, that key didn't work

47:28.480 --> 47:29.840
cause I was trying to break into your house.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.800
You'll never hear about it.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.440
If she tries to get in at a time

47:33.440 --> 47:35.280
when like you really wish she could get in,

47:35.280 --> 47:37.840
you can just say like, Dunk, I'm sorry.

47:37.840 --> 47:38.640
I guess it was like-

47:39.440 --> 47:41.920
I didn't test it before I gave it to you.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.440
Yeah, I should have tested it before I gave it to you.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.320
I'll know for next time.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.400
Looks like Home Depot really wanged it on this one.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.400
Oh well, too bad my cat is dead.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.400
This was a bad prank on myself and my cat.

47:53.440 --> 47:54.240
Sorry, cat.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.120
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

47:55.680 --> 47:56.320
Sure.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.040
We crushed that one.

47:57.760 --> 47:58.720
We deserve a little treat.

48:02.160 --> 48:02.880
This one's for us.

48:04.320 --> 48:06.400
You gotta do one for them and one for you.

48:06.400 --> 48:07.920
That's the Hollywood way.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.120
Rachel Rosings sent this one,

48:09.120 --> 48:10.720
a game recognized game, thank you, Rachel.

48:10.720 --> 48:11.520
It's an obvious troll

48:11.520 --> 48:13.120
so I wanna just blow through it and get to a good one

48:13.120 --> 48:15.120
but it's from Yahoo Answers user, Mr. Brightside

48:15.120 --> 48:20.000
who asks, how many calories are in a 2016 Silverado HD pickup truck?

48:20.000 --> 48:23.520
And I included it because the answer is so good.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.880
It's from Gabe who says,

48:24.880 --> 48:26.720
this is my favorite question of all time.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.240
Answer, enough.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.040
This one was sent in by Lindsay Waterman though.

48:37.040 --> 48:37.600
Thank you, Lindsay.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sarah, who asks,

48:41.520 --> 48:44.240
what is the cutest way to cuss?

48:44.880 --> 48:47.280
We are really gonna earn that explicit tag with this segment,

48:47.280 --> 48:47.760
I feel like.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.160
Put the kids to bed.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.200
It's about to get blue.

48:51.200 --> 48:55.200
Oh, bubble jugs.

48:55.200 --> 48:57.280
Dude, she had the choicest bubble jugs.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.760
Did you check out the bubble jugs on her?

48:59.760 --> 49:00.000
I respect them.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.600
So fucking juicy, dude.

49:01.600 --> 49:05.840
Wait, are you suggesting that that Pauly D voice

49:05.840 --> 49:07.120
is the cutest way to cuss?

49:08.880 --> 49:09.600
Let me try again.

49:09.600 --> 49:11.200
I was trying to do baby Pauly D.

49:11.200 --> 49:13.280
Yeah, do more baby less Pauly D.

49:14.160 --> 49:16.960
Yo, dude, she had the biggest bubble jugs.

49:16.960 --> 49:17.680
I loved them.

49:17.680 --> 49:20.560
It's to me, baby Pauly D.

49:20.560 --> 49:24.080
Jim tan laundry nap.

49:27.280 --> 49:30.080
GTLN, ta ta for now.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.560
I love Tigger.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.480
I made boom boom in my diapy.

49:34.480 --> 49:35.280
Look at the jugs.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.880
I made a boom boom.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.240
I love breastfeeding for a lot of reasons.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.920
Why don't you guys come over and make some menace throne

49:43.920 --> 49:44.960
and then blend it up?

49:44.960 --> 49:46.240
I ain't got teeth.

49:46.240 --> 49:48.000
Don't leave me in the hot tub.

49:48.000 --> 49:48.720
I'm a baby.

49:50.480 --> 49:51.440
Gotta love me.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.160
Not the mama, please.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.440
Please, God, I hope so.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.840
I forgot the question.

49:59.840 --> 50:02.560
What's the cutest way to cuss?

50:03.680 --> 50:06.960
Like a baby version of a jolly Jersey Shore character.

50:06.960 --> 50:11.600
This is tough because are we talking like non cuss word,

50:11.600 --> 50:13.920
cuss words, or are we talking like,

50:13.920 --> 50:18.080
oh, fuck, like what's the cutest way to deliver a cuss word

50:18.080 --> 50:20.080
or what's the cutest non cuss word, cuss word?

50:22.400 --> 50:24.160
Let me just blast through some of these answers

50:24.160 --> 50:27.680
because Terrence J's future girlfriend says

50:28.160 --> 50:29.600
there is an acute way to cuss

50:29.600 --> 50:31.680
because cussing is not attractive.

50:31.680 --> 50:32.480
Wrong.

50:32.480 --> 50:33.600
Oh, shit.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.320
Wrong.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.400
These are ugly words.

50:37.440 --> 50:40.000
But when someone can really stick the landing

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
on a good curse word, aren't you like,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.240
good curse word, aren't you like, damn,

50:45.280 --> 50:46.720
I felt that from over here.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.760
When my baby drops a popsicle on the ground,

50:49.760 --> 50:51.120
she looks at it and she gives it

50:51.120 --> 50:52.800
the perfect amount of breathing room

50:52.800 --> 50:54.640
and then just says, shit.

50:57.760 --> 50:59.040
That might actually be it.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.120
It's actually like a really cute way of cussing

51:01.120 --> 51:02.640
because like, I don't care.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.560
Like, I don't care if she cusses, she's a baby.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.240
She'll just drop it on the ground and look at it and go,

51:06.960 --> 51:07.680
oh, shit.

51:07.680 --> 51:09.680
I don't like, no, I will say, I will say,

51:09.680 --> 51:12.640
I don't like, I will say, I don't like when I get on Facebook

51:12.640 --> 51:14.880
and I see a little video and the parents are like,

51:14.880 --> 51:17.280
obviously like, they've developed this sort of

51:17.280 --> 51:18.800
Pavlovian response in their kids

51:18.800 --> 51:20.720
to make them say the word fuck for candy

51:20.720 --> 51:21.520
or something like that.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.640
And it's like, I can tell what you're doing there

51:24.640 --> 51:27.360
and it's like, great, that's gonna be great viral content.

51:27.360 --> 51:29.040
But that's not, I don't like that.

51:29.040 --> 51:30.320
I don't think I like that.

51:30.320 --> 51:30.820
Fuck.

51:31.680 --> 51:32.000
Get it?

51:32.000 --> 51:32.720
You said fuck.

51:32.720 --> 51:35.360
I did get it, but I don't like it.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.440
I like that ugly word.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.200
I do like that ugly word.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.640
But you gotta use it responsibly.

51:41.840 --> 51:44.240
My problem with children and cussing

51:44.240 --> 51:46.320
is that I think the exact age

51:46.960 --> 51:49.760
at which I will probably need to teach my daughter

51:49.760 --> 51:51.440
restraint in profanity

51:51.440 --> 51:54.320
is the exact age where she'll look me fucking dead in the eye

51:54.320 --> 51:57.600
and say, you make your living saying dick into a microphone.

51:57.600 --> 52:00.240
Get out of my fucking face, old man.

52:01.200 --> 52:01.700
What?

52:02.560 --> 52:03.920
I was just thinking about this.

52:04.560 --> 52:05.600
And this is weird.

52:05.600 --> 52:08.240
Nobody really says the word bastard anymore.

52:08.240 --> 52:10.240
Saying it, saying it feels weird.

52:10.240 --> 52:13.280
When I say it, I feel like Christopher Guest's character

52:13.280 --> 52:14.400
in Waiting for Guffman.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.640
You're bastard people.

52:16.640 --> 52:17.840
You're just bastard.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.360
You're bastard people.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.520
There's no, there's nobody said,

52:21.520 --> 52:24.320
like there's other words that have substituted that.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.960
Like, I like piece, you're a piece of shit.

52:26.960 --> 52:30.720
I think part of what has ruined it is Game of Thrones

52:30.720 --> 52:32.880
because bastard, we are reminded,

52:32.880 --> 52:34.400
has a very literal meaning.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.760
It has a very literal meaning

52:35.760 --> 52:37.680
that that show uses quite literally.

52:37.680 --> 52:39.760
Like it's not a generic,

52:41.040 --> 52:43.760
it has been reclaimed by real bastards.

52:43.760 --> 52:45.520
Everyone say it, say it.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.480
Bastard.

52:46.480 --> 52:47.200
Bastard.

52:47.200 --> 52:47.680
Bastard.

52:47.680 --> 52:50.160
It sounds, maybe it's got turd in it.

52:50.160 --> 52:52.160
I don't know what it is, but it sounds, it's,

52:52.160 --> 52:55.600
maybe we bring, this week it's all bastards and bubble jugs.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.720
That's what we're bringing back.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.320
It's getting really worried.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.640
We weren't gonna have an episode title in there, but.

53:02.640 --> 53:03.920
Bastards and bubble jugs.

53:03.920 --> 53:04.720
Bastard.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.240
What do you guys think?

53:06.240 --> 53:08.560
Time for another question or whatever you want to do.

53:08.560 --> 53:11.120
Yeah, one of my coworkers recently invited me

53:11.120 --> 53:12.400
to celebrate her impending,

53:12.400 --> 53:13.680
actually, you know what, before I read this,

53:13.680 --> 53:16.240
Travis, what's the best one that we haven't done yet?

53:16.240 --> 53:17.040
That one.

53:17.040 --> 53:19.680
Okay, one of my coworkers recently invited me

53:19.680 --> 53:22.800
to celebrate her impending marriage with a day at the spa.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.320
This would be fine, except that this particular spa

53:26.320 --> 53:29.600
requires all patrons to be completely naked at all times.

53:29.600 --> 53:30.400
Oh, nice.

53:30.400 --> 53:34.240
Oh, nice.

53:34.240 --> 53:35.440
So fucking choice.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.880
I see all these boobies walk around.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.320
I'm like, mm, lunch.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.920
Get out in bubble jugs.

53:41.920 --> 53:43.600
Get them bubble jugs out, mommy.

53:44.800 --> 53:45.760
Are you my mommy?

53:45.760 --> 53:47.280
By the way, I meant to ask.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.160
I'm so scared.

53:48.880 --> 53:49.920
I'm so scared.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.040
All the lights are so bright.

53:51.920 --> 53:52.400
Other people.

53:52.400 --> 53:53.680
Loud noises.

53:53.680 --> 53:54.800
Loud noises.

53:54.800 --> 53:57.600
My mommy went around a corner and she stopped existing.

53:57.600 --> 53:57.920
Yo.

53:58.480 --> 53:58.720
Yo.

53:58.720 --> 53:59.680
Yo.

53:59.680 --> 54:02.480
Other people attending this get together

54:02.480 --> 54:06.080
include our boss and her husband and my coworker's fiance

54:06.080 --> 54:07.520
who is in his 70s.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.760
My coworker and I are both in our late 20s.

54:09.760 --> 54:12.320
I want to support my friend, but I

54:12.320 --> 54:15.920
can live without exposing my business to all and sundry.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.240
Is there a way to make this less awkward?

54:18.240 --> 54:20.480
If I don't go, do I risk being alienated at work

54:20.480 --> 54:22.800
because I'm the only one who hasn't seen everybody's junk?

54:22.800 --> 54:25.600
Okay, wait.

54:25.600 --> 54:28.240
Okay, any advice to be appreciated?

54:28.240 --> 54:30.640
That's from can I at least get a towel in New York?

54:30.640 --> 54:34.400
I was so ready to tell this person, like, just don't go.

54:34.400 --> 54:37.040
Like, you're an adult and you don't want to go be naked with everybody.

54:37.040 --> 54:40.640
But then they made the point that what if everyone's standing around the office

54:40.640 --> 54:43.440
on the following Monday having a good laugh and you're like,

54:43.440 --> 54:44.560
hey, what are you guys laughing about?

54:44.560 --> 54:45.680
And they're like, you wouldn't understand.

54:45.680 --> 54:46.880
You didn't see Todd's penis.

54:49.840 --> 54:51.200
Todd's penis becomes the office.

54:51.200 --> 54:51.680
End joke.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.120
Yo, Todd, how's that weird ball?

54:54.400 --> 54:55.440
You got me again.

54:55.440 --> 54:56.640
Wait, what's up with this ball?

54:56.640 --> 54:57.520
Don't worry about it.

54:57.520 --> 54:57.840
Don't worry.

54:57.840 --> 55:00.400
You really had to be there and see Todd's ball.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.560
What the fuck's wrong with you asking a question like that?

55:03.120 --> 55:04.640
I'll see Todd's ball now.

55:04.640 --> 55:06.560
No, it was the context.

55:06.560 --> 55:08.480
Todd, get your ball out right now.

55:09.840 --> 55:15.280
I'm sick of you guys holding Todd's ball over my head.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.480
He's very flexible.

55:16.480 --> 55:17.040
I'll give you that.

55:17.040 --> 55:20.240
And you're all very strong to lift Todd's ball the way up there.

55:20.240 --> 55:23.840
It's there, but then I turn around and he's covered it and I'm sick of it.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.760
Thank you, Susan, for coming to your annual review.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.280
Boy, it's been kind of a weird year, huh?

55:32.080 --> 55:34.320
Thick, thick document this year, huh, Susan?

55:34.880 --> 55:35.920
Kind of a weird one, huh?

55:35.920 --> 55:36.640
Kind of wacky.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.400
It just seems like it's a back and forth of HR complaints.

55:40.400 --> 55:42.240
You and Todd, Todd and you.

55:42.240 --> 55:44.160
It's just, it seems endless.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.880
You need to let go of this whole Todd's weird ball thing.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.160
Can you put like, what is it?

55:49.200 --> 55:52.400
We put this one into arbitration and they have actually sided with you.

55:52.400 --> 55:53.440
Todd, get that nut out.

55:54.080 --> 55:55.920
I need to know it's a telltale ball.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.080
I need to know that it's driving me crazy.

55:58.080 --> 56:04.560
I wonder if when these people are back at the office and if it's just them in a meeting,

56:04.560 --> 56:05.840
do you think it crosses their mind?

56:05.840 --> 56:07.440
Like, why are we wearing clothes?

56:07.440 --> 56:08.880
Why are we wasting our time here?

56:08.880 --> 56:09.760
We should-

56:09.760 --> 56:11.600
It's super casual Friday.

56:11.600 --> 56:13.600
This is super duper casual Friday.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.760
First, I mean, the good advice that's going to help get you through this is just like,

56:20.640 --> 56:22.160
close your eyes, repeat after me.

56:22.160 --> 56:24.960
I'm just hot tubbing in the Japanese style.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.960
They don't let you cover up your ding-dong over there.

56:27.840 --> 56:32.000
And you don't know, it's weird to be in a place where you don't understand the language

56:32.000 --> 56:36.880
and you know just the baseline of the cultural norms and then you are also put in the situations

56:36.880 --> 56:42.240
where there's just everybody, it is just a brain convention.

56:42.240 --> 56:42.800
You know what I mean?

56:42.800 --> 56:44.240
You know what, Griffin?

56:44.240 --> 56:47.920
You have changed my mind because I choked at the beginning that you should just not go.

56:47.920 --> 56:53.680
But like, it's not like you've been invited to an Eyes Wide Shut orgy.

56:53.680 --> 56:55.200
Like everyone's just going to be naked.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.160
It's going to be okay.

56:56.800 --> 57:02.640
Maybe you should just go and expand your perception of like humanity and like the human body.

57:02.640 --> 57:03.840
No, the human body is beautiful.

57:03.840 --> 57:09.920
But I'm not, I get that like some people are uncomfortable with this.

57:09.920 --> 57:16.240
Truth be told, I was wicked, very wholly uncomfortable with the wholeness of my being.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.160
I just thought I'd try it because I was in Japan.

57:18.160 --> 57:22.480
I don't think I would do it if I was just like in some spa in New York state.

57:23.920 --> 57:27.200
But I think if you get that in that mindset, it might help out.

57:28.400 --> 57:29.760
Yeah, but yeah, that's what I'm saying.

57:29.760 --> 57:33.520
It's like, I don't think it's going to hurt you.

57:33.520 --> 57:35.760
It's the co-workers that is the bad thing.

57:35.760 --> 57:40.000
I don't think it's the being nude around other people like, fuck that, whatever.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.120
It's the being around the co-workers.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.880
I'm thinking about it now with my co-workers.

57:42.880 --> 57:46.160
Like that's going to be an uncomfy Monday, isn't it?

57:46.720 --> 57:49.200
Like if I was Garfield, I would hate that Monday extra.

57:49.200 --> 57:51.840
What if it's like the biggest team building exercise though?

57:51.840 --> 57:54.000
Like you think like, oh, this is going to be so uncomfortable Monday,

57:54.000 --> 57:57.200
but actually Monday is the first time you finally have the confidence to like

57:57.200 --> 57:59.840
tell Derek that you don't like when he listens to NPR in the morning

57:59.840 --> 58:02.080
because you're just trying to like warm up and have some coffee

58:02.080 --> 58:04.160
and he's like blasting car talk or whatever.

58:04.160 --> 58:06.000
I take that back because car talk is amazing,

58:06.000 --> 58:08.560
but maybe it's the first time that you feel comfortable saying something

58:08.560 --> 58:09.840
because you've seen his butthole.

58:09.840 --> 58:12.480
Just because you've seen Derek's butthole, you can finally be like,

58:12.480 --> 58:14.480
ah, fuck car talk.

58:14.480 --> 58:16.080
Oh God, that feels good.

58:16.080 --> 58:18.080
Derek, your butthole gave me the confidence to do it.

58:19.760 --> 58:21.120
Thanks for getting that bad boy out.

58:21.840 --> 58:24.240
We've got nothing left to hide from each other, Derek.

58:24.240 --> 58:25.280
I hate car talk.

58:27.680 --> 58:28.880
Nobody hates car talk.

58:28.880 --> 58:29.840
Nobody hates car talk.

58:29.840 --> 58:30.480
It's so good.

58:30.480 --> 58:32.400
I don't, I don't, I don't know what to tell you.

58:32.400 --> 58:36.800
Cause like I, this sounds, I'm, I would get in any spa.

58:36.800 --> 58:39.680
Anytime I'm offered a spa trip, I take it every time.

58:39.680 --> 58:40.480
I treat myself.

58:40.480 --> 58:42.240
I don't know if I've talked to you guys about this.

58:42.240 --> 58:44.480
I treat myself to a massage every month.

58:44.480 --> 58:46.160
I found a little massage place nearby.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.280
It does them pretty cheap.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.920
Get an hour deep, deep tissue every month.

58:49.920 --> 58:50.960
Just do a little something.

58:50.960 --> 58:57.360
It's like, it's like the, the detective guy from Twin Peaks said in that one scene,

58:57.360 --> 58:59.680
you gotta do something for yourself every day.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.760
And for me, it's every once a month and I get a massage.

59:01.760 --> 59:03.120
So treat yourself to that.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.360
Enjoy the experience, the luxury of that.

59:05.360 --> 59:08.400
But I do get, I don't know how you get past the fact that you're going to see

59:08.400 --> 59:11.680
your boss's 70 year old balls.

59:11.680 --> 59:14.560
I'll tell you, I think this is the question you got to ask yourself.

59:16.080 --> 59:17.760
Are you okay with 70 year old balls?

59:17.760 --> 59:22.800
Are you sitting there thinking, I would go, but I'm afraid it's uncomfortable.

59:22.800 --> 59:27.280
Or are you thinking I have 100,000% zero interest in going?

59:28.000 --> 59:28.560
Like, yeah.

59:29.920 --> 59:30.240
Yeah.

59:30.240 --> 59:31.280
If it's just like, you know what?

59:31.280 --> 59:33.920
I would go, but I'm afraid it's going to be uncomfortable.

59:33.920 --> 59:34.800
You should go.

59:34.800 --> 59:38.080
If you're like, I, I do not want to go at all.

59:38.080 --> 59:39.920
You have complete autonomy over your life.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.040
Do not go to that thing.

59:42.400 --> 59:45.760
It's not, it's going to, you've just pitched a scenario

59:45.760 --> 59:47.920
where there's a chance it won't be uncomfortable.

59:47.920 --> 59:49.920
And to me, I just like to play that scene out

59:49.920 --> 59:53.040
where you come out of the dressing room nude in the spa zone

59:53.040 --> 59:55.040
and everyone's just like, yeah, cool.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.600
Everybody sees your boss and they're like, I love how old it is down there.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.720
I like how mature and wizened it is.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.560
Greg, I've never seen one like that before.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.360
Neat.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.480
Have a seat next to me.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.320
You did great with your testicles.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.280
Neat balls, Greg.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.840
Those testicles are besticles.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.040
Sit on down.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.920
But be careful.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.560
But be careful.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.840
You don't want to belvedere yourself.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.040
At 70, the leading causes of trauma is falling.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.960
Just like, oh, it's just falling down.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.480
But the other one is belvedering.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:35.040
I'd like for you both to read these pamphlets.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:44.800
I don't know what it is and I'm afraid to ask.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.320
The worst part is at that age, if you sit on a roll, it'll just pop.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.960
Like an overripe grape.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.440
Just like, and you'll hear that noise, you'll know.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.240
And then it'll definitely be awkward.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.160
Then it'll be super awkward.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.880
This pamphlet is called Streaks on the Epididymis.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.720
And it's important you read it cover to cover.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.600
The life you save might be your own.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.080
So this has been our podcast, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.040
We hope you had fun.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.080
Got the little checklist here.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.720
I'm checking Epididymis off it.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.520
Said that on the show.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.240
OK, here we go.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.880
Guess what?

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.960
We're coming this weekend to New York and DC.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.080
Tickets to that are sold out.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.560
But if you're coming to those shows,

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.600
get fucking ready to get weird because it's going to be fun.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.240
But guess what?

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.280
Even more.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:35.680
Guess what?

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.240
Even more.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.840
Got more shows.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.340
What?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.080
July the 15th and 16th, the three of us

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.960
are going to be performing in Boston at the Wilbur Theater

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.240
because Boston asked for it.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.760
So we're making it happen.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.640
Now, Justin.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.080
Rest of the country, I get it.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.440
The rest of the country, I get it.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.280
Like, I know that we're kind of sticking to the Upper East

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.480
Coast a little bit here.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.680
But we've never done Boston before, like, ever.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.800
And the demand there is very enthusiastic.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.960
And so we're just going to, like, knock it out,

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.400
give Boston the best night of their lives,

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.360
two nights of their lives.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.360
But the coolest part about this is the Saturday,

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.160
which is the 16th, right?

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.960
Look at the calendar here.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.000
Make sure I'm saying this right.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.600
All right, on the 15th and 16th, the 16th,

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.760
we are going to be performing My Brother, My Brother,

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.000
and Me at the Wilbur Theater.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:34.960
Yeah, it's this one.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.680
And Travis, what's the link if people

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.880
want to buy tickets to that?

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.200
That is bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Boston.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.320
All lowercase.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.560
They will go on sale very soon.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.080
They will go on sale.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.160
Wednesday at noon Eastern.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.240
And that's going to be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.120
Those tickets will go on sale, what do we say, just now?

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.880
Wednesday, noon Eastern.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.320
So Wednesday, June 1st, noon Eastern time.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.840
And those are going, okay, let me put it this way.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:13.200
Our show in New York was at a slightly larger venue

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.320
and it sold out in two hours.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.440
So please, or like three hours, please don't sleep on that.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.280
Please, if you want tickets, just buy them.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.600
And come, because it's going to be fun.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.200
Now here's the crazier part.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.520
The day before that, on Friday,

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.520
we're doing our first ever publicly attendable live episode

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.680
of the Adventure Zone.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.640
We did one at LA PodFest that was only available

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.000
if you were attending PodFest.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.360
It was crazy.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.280
It was a crazy good time.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.360
And now we're opening it up to everyone in Boston

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.720
and the surrounding area.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.640
My Brother, My Brother, Me is fun,

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.040
but the Adventure Zone is going to be a vicious cycle.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.080
It's going to be a visual spectacle.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.200
There are costumes.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.040
That's all I'm saying.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.280
There are costumes and props.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.360
And there's a very good chance that our dad will be there

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.560
because he's like in it.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.000
And there's a great chance I'm going to be like,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.440
super nervous.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.280
You don't want to miss that.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.480
And if you have any interest in that,

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.080
if you're like, it can't,

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.880
like I cannot foresee live Adventure Zones

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.120
being ever being something that we do a lot.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.360
So like, if you can get there, please get there

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.720
because there will not be a lot of opportunities

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.240
in like all of your life.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.080
It's a really hard,

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.560
it's a very, very difficult show to do live.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.480
Super duper hard.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.320
So we don't do them that often.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.640
I'm excited to do this one though.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.920
I've got a great idea for it.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.000
And those tickets are available at bit.ly forward slash

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.520
Taz Boston.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.360
That was a hint.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.200
That was a hint by the way,

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.520
about what the episode will be about.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.680
I see.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:35.960
We're also working on a deal.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.600
So each of those, the tickets are,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.360
I believe $26 total or $26.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.840
And we're doing the plus one thing again.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.280
So one of those dollars will be donated

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.080
to a charitable cause.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.120
It's called Branches.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.680
It's a domestic violence shelter here in Huntington.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.520
We're working on a deal where you can get tickets

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.040
to both shows for $40 total,

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.000
but there will be a limited amount of those.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I think 250 total.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.080
You can get the combo tickets at bit.ly forward slash

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.240
Boston Combo all lowercase.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.520
And like I said, there's a limited amount of those.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.800
You can still buy tickets to both

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.560
even after those have sold out.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.680
But if you're looking to maybe capitalize

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.040
on the fact that we're doing two shows

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.680
in the same town back to back,

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.400
you're gonna wanna move on those combo tickets

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.680
pretty quickly.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.120
Now the Boston Combo is also my favorite sexual act.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.920
And let me describe to you what goes into it.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.120
I'd rather we didn't.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.880
Thanks to John Rogers and the Long Winders

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.760
for the use of the theme song

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.800
instead of departure off the album,

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.440
put in the days to Ben.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.280
Like we said earlier,

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.760
we've got those live shows coming up this weekend.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.600
So please send in Yahoo's and questions

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.640
and label them DC and NYC in the subject line.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.320
And we're gonna have audience questions,

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.440
live audience questions.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.520
So start thinking about what those questions are gonna be.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.680
One rule of course, no bummers.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.160
Yeah.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.480
Also just keep in mind just to get it out there.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.720
We always intend on doing meet and greets,

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.400
but now we're traveling with like a basically

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.840
two year old child and my pregnant wife.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.560
And so I can't guarantee that everyone will be

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.960
in a physical shape to do a meet and greet.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.200
So if we do not, I so, so apologize.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.600
I just want to get it out there

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.080
that there is a possibility that we do not,

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.400
but we're definitely gonna try to.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.840
Yeah, we're trying to be as like,

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.480
I really, I want, like I want to,

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.480
but we have basically become

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.480
the fucking traveling Wilberries at this point.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.000
Like it is such a giant normal family affair.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.280
And yeah.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.000
Especially since both shows will be three shows in one.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:31.840
Yeah.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.680
It'll probably go a little bit later than normal.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.400
And I just can't guarantee that we'll be able

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.520
to stick around for hours and hours afterwards.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.240
We'll try to holler.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.240
I don't want to poo poo it.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.080
Do you guys want this final yahoo though?

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:42.920
Hell yeah.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.240
Oh, I want to say one thing before we go.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.800
Check out all the other Max Fun shows,

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.440
including a brand new show.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.520
If you like the TV show, Adam Ruins Everything,

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.640
or the web series, Adam Ruins Everything,

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.600
Max Fun is now host to the Adam Ruins Everything podcast.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.640
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.480
Yeah.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.960
So basically they take, you know,

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.520
so for example, they did an episode

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.520
about like transit and cars.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.160
So in that, Adam gets to talk to an expert

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.440
for like three minutes on the TV show.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.000
Well, so for the podcast,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.840
he gets back in touch with that expert

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.240
and they talk about like transit for like an hour

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.840
so that he really gets to pick the brain of an expert

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.880
and it's on Max Fun.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.520
So check it out.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.360
That's very exciting.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360
All right, final yahoo.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.760
This one was sent in by Erin Keys.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.160
Thank you, Erin Keys.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.080
It's by, seriously, start thinking about a nickname.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.840
Getting a lot of Erin Keys action.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.080
She, Erin Keys tweeted that she hated the term keister.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.120
So that one's not going to stick.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:33.960
Okay. That's out.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960
Key master.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.240
Keep on, just keep on cranking away on it.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.080
Great, great.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.880
Keeper, Keysper.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.720
Keysper the friendly ghost.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.120
Okay.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.440
Keysper Sutherland.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.280
The fuck are we doing here?

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.200
Yahoo Answers user Sweeney Todd asked this one.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.080
Sweeney Todd asked, how creative is Kid Rock?

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.600
I'm Justin McElroy

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.080
and the bacon mozzarella burger is available in Wendy's now.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:03.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.360
Happy Memorial Day.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.160
I'm Griffin McElroy, 420 blaze it.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.480
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.480
Kiss your dance ground lips.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:35.480
Hey, girls, do you want to say hey, I want to?
