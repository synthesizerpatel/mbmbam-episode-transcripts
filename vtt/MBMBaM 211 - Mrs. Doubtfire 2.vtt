00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.720
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother,

00:46.720 --> 00:50.880
mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.040
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.760
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.920
I'm really, really excited, you guys.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.120
What's going on, Trav?

00:59.120 --> 01:02.320
Well, we get a lot of questions, you know, a lot of people asking for help,

01:03.200 --> 01:05.920
and which is great. I mean, that's what our show is built on.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.920
It's built adjacent to that.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.920
It's not adjacent. It's help adjacent.

01:10.880 --> 01:17.280
This week, we got a really exciting email where a young gentleman is asking for help

01:17.280 --> 01:19.920
and it's going to financially benefit us.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.360
Oh, I like that. I actually like the second thing better than the first thing.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.280
Yeah, he's a young man in Africa, in Kenya, and he's having a bit of legal trouble.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.160
His father passed away in 2009.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.280
Oh, that's a shame.

01:35.280 --> 01:43.200
He had in the bank $10 million and all he needs is our bank account information

01:43.200 --> 01:45.680
so he can transfer that money in there.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.680
You had me at email.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.600
Just go for it. Send it, send it right away.

01:49.600 --> 01:57.440
It's 464-4664-4.

01:57.440 --> 01:57.680
Okay.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.800
Six, go.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.400
I said hit it, Rich.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.520
So, I mean, we might be able to retire from doing the show

02:05.520 --> 02:07.760
because we get to keep 40% of it.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.800
That's like $4 million.

02:09.920 --> 02:13.360
I'm refreshing our simple transaction page.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.000
Just waiting for that money to come.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.120
We're at negative dollars.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.000
Oh, no.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.320
We're at these transition conversion rates.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.280
You got to spend money.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.120
You got to spend money, make money, you know?

02:25.120 --> 02:26.560
That's right. This is an investment.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.880
I don't feel great about this.

02:28.880 --> 02:34.240
Well, he just had some trouble with his wicked stepmother and his uncle's legal team.

02:34.240 --> 02:39.120
So, I'm sure he's just needing some money to help battle them and get their stuff back.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.240
And it's going to be fun.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.520
It's going to be great.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.880
We're going to be rolling.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.920
Did he provide a return email address that we can sort of correspond

02:45.920 --> 02:49.040
and just sort of check on like what the hiccup was?

02:49.040 --> 02:51.360
Because I know sometimes like the wires get crossed.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.200
That's not just like an idiom.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.720
Sometimes the wires, when you wire money to people, get crossed.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.680
And then our 10 mil-

02:59.680 --> 03:01.520
Was it 10 mil that we were getting?

03:01.520 --> 03:02.240
I imagine just a chunk of it.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.600
I mean, we get to keep 4 million of it.

03:06.160 --> 03:06.660
Okay.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.240
How much were we supposed to-

03:08.240 --> 03:10.000
You didn't even tell me how much we were supposed to send over.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.040
I just did all of it.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.880
I just clicked the transfer all button.

03:12.880 --> 03:13.760
I think that sounds right.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.760
I think he just has like as much as you can.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.200
Why do they even have that button?

03:17.760 --> 03:18.640
Yeah, I don't know.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.800
It says transfer all to Canyon Prince.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.560
As long as we're updating, I want to give you guys a couple of updates on my life.

03:25.280 --> 03:31.600
First is I chased my cat out of the litter box so I could shut her out of the office

03:31.600 --> 03:33.200
for recording soundproofing.

03:33.200 --> 03:33.840
Terrific.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.520
And now I have locked myself in a stinking prison.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.440
Please send help.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.080
Please.

03:40.080 --> 03:40.800
I'm dying.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.080
Second, ugh, second alert.

03:44.080 --> 03:49.440
I wanted to give everybody a quick pregnancy update via a message I found yesterday that

03:49.440 --> 03:50.560
I thought you all would enjoy.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.240
And I thought we could just stage a reading of this real quick.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.960
I was looking for no baby yet.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
Looking for information about how people have-

03:58.960 --> 04:00.800
There is a baby.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.520
There is a baby.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.800
It's not visible.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.840
Not a visible baby.

04:03.840 --> 04:04.960
Invisible baby.

04:04.960 --> 04:11.120
I found this brief forum exchange yesterday while I was cruising.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.880
There are three messages in the exchange, so I figured we could just go me, Travis,

04:14.880 --> 04:15.280
Griffin.

04:15.280 --> 04:15.760
You ready?

04:15.760 --> 04:16.480
Yeah, it's perfect.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.120
Nice, he says, I'm a 41-year-old mother of four.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.160
Every woman pregnancy are very much so different.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.880
I would advise you all to let Mother Nature take its course.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.520
All the oils and different regimes may harm the baby.

04:29.520 --> 04:33.280
The safety of the baby is more important than trying to jumpstart labor on your own.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.720
Congratulations to you, and good luck on your beautiful blessing.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.480
And then Nice, he says again, we are the same age.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.400
Name and kids, congratulations.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.320
And then Ashley says, screw you, I'm 19.

04:46.320 --> 04:46.800
He's ready.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.840
He's just stuck.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.720
I'm going to induce.

04:52.080 --> 04:52.960
I'm 19.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.000
He's ready.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.280
He's just stuck.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.240
He's just stuck.

04:56.240 --> 04:59.920
We need to prime the cannon and blast that baby on after.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.040
I love that Ashley throws in the age, I'm 19.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.840
So I'm a world-wise woman.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.600
I know that he's just stuck.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.800
He's just stuck.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.720
I'm 19.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.880
I'm not some kid, all right?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.400
I'm just a child.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.080
Screw you, I'm 19.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.120
I can tell when a baby's stuck in my gully works.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.920
All right, so that's where I'm at.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.440
Anyway, those are our problems, but we don't need to stress you out about those.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.880
I, once again, just to check in, have no problems.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.640
No problems still on the Griffin front.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.760
So let's help our listeners.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.360
Hey, brothers, I have a question.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.440
Sometimes my friends and I will go to bars or restaurants.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.640
Like cool people.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.240
Like cool people, a place to hang out and have fun like you do.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.120
Problem is, oh my God, the smell.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.360
The problem is one of my friends will often come along and then not order anything.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.360
I feel like this is rather rude to the establishment.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.000
Am I being weird and should just let it go?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.520
If not, what should I do?

05:57.520 --> 05:59.760
That's from Empty Cheers in Davis, CA.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.960
I think that's Cal-a-rado.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.240
Cal-a-rado.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.720
I, man, you can...

06:07.920 --> 06:13.920
I worry so much about myself fucking up accidentally without meaning to all of the time

06:13.920 --> 06:18.720
that if I extended that service to everybody in my immediate vicinity,

06:19.600 --> 06:23.840
I don't know why I'm speaking in the hypothetical sense right now

06:23.840 --> 06:26.480
because I do definitely do that and it kills me.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.200
It's killing me.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.640
It's killing me.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.160
Do you know what's especially bad?

06:30.160 --> 06:32.480
If you have a bar that you...

06:32.480 --> 06:35.680
So for example, in Cincinnati, we go to Arnold's all the time.

06:35.680 --> 06:36.640
It's like our theater bar.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.920
It's where we hang out.

06:37.920 --> 06:43.040
And so if a new person went and did something that I would think of as rude,

06:44.640 --> 06:48.400
it would be so much more embarrassing because it's like, hey, this is our place.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.240
Could you just be cool for two seconds and order some cheesy fries?

06:52.240 --> 06:53.120
They know us here.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.640
Be cool for five seconds.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.960
Can you just order a hot brown, please?

06:56.960 --> 07:00.000
Just get a hot Dubin, please, for the love of Jesus.

07:00.560 --> 07:06.400
I feel like if you're just taking up a seat though, like a table with friends,

07:06.400 --> 07:08.240
then that's not really that big of an issue.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.480
I mean, just not ordering something, right?

07:10.480 --> 07:13.440
I mean, the only person who's going to be aware of that is the server

07:14.400 --> 07:15.760
if they're coming to the table.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.480
And I don't know, that has to be mixed with some relief

07:18.480 --> 07:21.120
that they don't have to do more work, right?

07:21.120 --> 07:25.760
Well, I guess the question is, is it the same friend more than once?

07:25.760 --> 07:26.560
Oh, okay.

07:26.560 --> 07:31.280
You know, if like Tom always just sits there when you go to-

07:31.280 --> 07:32.400
Thrifty Reggie.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.120
Yeah, Thrifty Reggie just sits there at Cheesy Steve's

07:35.120 --> 07:37.520
and doesn't order the cheesy fries ever.

07:37.520 --> 07:43.520
No, and if you go to Cheesy Steve's, you have to, I mean, it's basically a mandate.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.840
Yeah, it's what they're known for.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.120
It's the only thing on the menu.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.120
Can I have a water?

07:49.120 --> 07:51.600
No, no, you can't have a water.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.360
I can blend down some cheesy fries for you.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.280
I guess, do we even have a blend?

07:55.280 --> 07:55.920
No, we don't.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.160
They do a beer, like a French onion soup,

07:58.160 --> 08:00.800
and there's just like bread and cheese floating on top.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.680
That's it?

08:01.680 --> 08:05.360
We have a deep fat fryer and we got the cheese blaster.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.800
And that's the only two instruments we got back.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.920
We don't even have glasses.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.200
We don't have glass in the windows.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.680
This is a shitty place.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.040
This is shitty.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.880
I don't know why people keep coming here.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.880
Yeah, man, I wouldn't, there are so many.

08:20.880 --> 08:26.640
I always think of it like there are so many worse things that you could do at a restaurant.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.360
You could like, I was talking to a guy the other day about playing D&D here in Austin,

08:31.360 --> 08:35.040
like where you find a group to do it, like where you find neutral ground to play it with strangers.

08:35.040 --> 08:39.840
He told me he used to play with a group that used to go to a pizza place near our house,

08:39.840 --> 08:43.440
and they would just post up in the pizza place and play through like three hours of a campaign.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.200
And I was like, how were they fucking cool with that?

08:47.200 --> 08:50.800
Like, cause you, those nerds are going to, you know, chomp down,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.920
but they're not going to chomp down for three straight hours.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.840
Well, here's how you're fucking cool with that.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.640
If you show up between like two and five, you're fine.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.600
If you order enough to justify being there, you're fine.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.320
And then if you tip really well, you're fine.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.520
Like, that's the thing.

09:09.520 --> 09:13.760
If you think about being there for three hours, the amount of opportunities they have to come over

09:13.760 --> 09:21.600
and like refill your drinks and like check on you and everything, you have to tip like 30, 35%.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.000
But eventually you don't think the cashier is just like,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I'm fucking sick of looking at these people.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.400
Juicy, are you okay?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.200
Did you pass out?

09:31.120 --> 09:31.680
Oh shit.

09:34.160 --> 09:34.880
Hey.

09:34.880 --> 09:35.920
Hey, what happened?

09:35.920 --> 09:38.160
I had to go empty out the litter box.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.760
Oh my God, you actually did it.

09:39.760 --> 09:44.640
Obama called and he said FEMA was going to have to start issuing housing vouchers to my neighbors.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.800
If I didn't detain it.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.880
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

09:48.880 --> 09:49.360
Of course.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.480
This Yahoo is sent in by Drew Davenport.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.120
Thank you, Drew.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.880
He has a lot of honorifics.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.560
You know, some people are starting to get real jealous of Drew Davenport.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.880
Well guys, his game is super on point.

10:08.880 --> 10:14.480
I wish Drew, could Drew do, would Drew be comfortable with going to our Facebook page

10:15.280 --> 10:17.040
and just sharing some of his secrets?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.320
I don't think he will.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.560
I love Drew Davenport.

10:20.560 --> 10:29.760
I think he is protecting his secrets the same way that Lex Luthor protects his, protects his-

10:30.480 --> 10:31.680
The location of Scriptonite.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.680
Let me just, I'll just do that for you and-

10:33.680 --> 10:34.320
That worked.

10:34.320 --> 10:34.880
That worked great.

10:34.880 --> 10:35.360
Hit me.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.720
Drew Davenport, thank you, is asked by Yahoo Answers user Sophie who asks,

10:38.720 --> 10:39.680
is it weird?

10:39.680 --> 10:42.080
I prefer this type of acting.

10:43.920 --> 10:44.800
Huh?

10:44.800 --> 10:50.240
My friends like the whole Hayden Christensen lightsaber fighting, jumping about,

10:50.240 --> 10:52.000
trying to be cool and intimidating.

10:52.640 --> 10:56.240
Yet I prefer the Marlon Brando Godfather.

10:56.240 --> 11:02.000
I think Brando sat in the big chair is so much cooler and I find it intimidating as well.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.600
I mean, who is the better actor?

11:03.600 --> 11:06.480
Hayden Christensen or Marlon Brando?

11:06.480 --> 11:08.720
Ooh, taking a bold stance.

11:08.720 --> 11:18.080
Is it, is it, is it weird that I prefer Marlon Brando to Hayden Christensen?

11:18.080 --> 11:22.400
Now I know he's a little indie, little known actor that not a lot of people have heard of,

11:22.400 --> 11:25.440
but I think that that Marlon Brando's got chops.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.200
I guess, but does he have Hayden Christensen chops?

11:29.200 --> 11:30.320
Listen, who does?

11:30.320 --> 11:33.360
I'm just saying like, it doesn't even, like you gotta scale it different.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.400
You know what I mean?

11:34.400 --> 11:37.200
Like Brando is the best of like the Brandos.

11:37.200 --> 11:37.840
You know what I mean?

11:37.840 --> 11:42.560
Is he going to be able to break into the like Christensen levels?

11:42.560 --> 11:44.320
No, no, of course not.

11:44.320 --> 11:49.120
But what he does with what he's got is very impressive.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.960
I guess I look forward to his new stuff.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.680
Yeah, yeah.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.200
He'll never hit that Orlando Bloom echelon, right?

11:57.200 --> 11:57.840
Oh God, no.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.000
He's, he's clearly not going to Bloom.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.320
He's never going to Christensen.

12:02.320 --> 12:08.800
That's it, I mean, I'm, I have an internal debate that I argue about with myself every day

12:08.800 --> 12:10.000
of Christensen or Bloom.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.040
Brando doesn't even fucking factor into the equation.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.400
You know who the wild card is?

12:14.400 --> 12:18.240
The wild card is Ewan McGregor because he, I think he can straddle,

12:18.240 --> 12:20.400
but he does the lightsaber fights.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.200
Like, so he's hitting that level and he's a big fish.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.160
And he's big fishing.

12:24.160 --> 12:24.640
You know what I mean?

12:24.640 --> 12:25.360
He's big fishing.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.560
The problem is what sort of muddies these waters.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.400
That the big fish live in.

12:30.400 --> 12:30.720
Go on.

12:30.720 --> 12:34.400
The big fish live in is that Marlon Brando was so good in Star Wars.

12:35.760 --> 12:41.520
Who will ever forget that classic scene of him standing in the rains of Endor

12:41.520 --> 12:47.920
in his white wife beater and his face twisted up in anguish and just shouting Star Wars.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.240
I'll never forget that scene.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.880
I liked it Star Wars when his giant floating head appeared to Luke and said,

12:56.880 --> 12:57.840
I am your father.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.960
So check, check out this fortress of solitude I made for you.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.240
I thought, whoa, wait a minute.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.040
Wait, huh?

13:05.040 --> 13:08.000
There, there are some unexpected crossover here.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.800
I thought it was weird when for like, just like it jumped from like a lightsaber fight

13:14.800 --> 13:16.320
in the middle of the Death Star.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.200
And then inexplicably he was an old man and he died.

13:19.200 --> 13:24.800
He died in a garden while his, his grandson watched him die.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.160
And then his grandson grew up to be Boba Fett.

13:28.160 --> 13:28.880
Mm-hmm.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.960
I love that one scene where he's just flopping around with his big silly head.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.280
And he's like, Misa could have been a contender.

13:35.280 --> 13:35.760
Uh-huh.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.280
Yeah, that was a good one too.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.000
Oh man.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.440
But how does, how does he stack up to Hayden?

13:41.440 --> 13:43.440
There's a reason he wasn't young Vader.

13:44.080 --> 13:44.640
You know?

13:44.640 --> 13:49.120
Cause like he did, he, whenever Cass, I don't know if you guys know about how big Hollywood

13:49.120 --> 13:52.960
works and Travis, I guess you should learn about this since you're about to be a fucking

13:52.960 --> 13:55.840
cog in that, that horrible machine.

13:56.560 --> 14:02.400
But casting directors, when they cast parts, they're basically ranking who the best actor

14:02.400 --> 14:03.440
is, right?

14:03.440 --> 14:08.240
So if, if Marlon Brando had been better than Hayden Christensen, he would have been young

14:08.240 --> 14:08.640
Vader.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.560
He would have been grown up Anakin.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.760
He would have been fucking necking with Natalie Portman.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.400
I have a question though, Griffin.

14:16.400 --> 14:22.800
How do they do, if, if one actor is the best actor, they call them first, right?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.160
In the ranking systems.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.400
How do they decide which part to fill?

14:26.400 --> 14:31.120
How do you make the system so that the best actor doesn't get all the parts?

14:31.840 --> 14:33.040
You go top down.

14:33.040 --> 14:33.840
Is that what happened?

14:33.840 --> 14:34.560
Well, that's what I'm saying.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.200
Some casting directors get creative about it.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.720
For instance, um, the Nutty Professor.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.040
Yep.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.360
They said, how can we fucking choose?

14:43.360 --> 14:46.000
He would slot into any of these parts perfectly.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.760
We have a lot of people on retainer that we could get, but is our, tell me, I'm going

14:51.760 --> 14:54.480
to meet with our CGI team and see what they can do.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.920
And then the CGI team was like, of course we can multiply him.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.360
Multiplicity, same thing.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.000
Same deal.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.200
It was not supposed to be Michael Keaton in all of those roles, which is confusing because

15:03.200 --> 15:04.720
it's supposed to be clones, right?

15:04.720 --> 15:04.960
Right.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.200
Um, but the, the CGI tech wasn't good enough back then.

15:09.200 --> 15:14.240
It was originally going to be Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Chris Bale.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.400
I think that's what happened in the social network, right?

15:16.400 --> 15:19.280
It's like they hired two dudes to play the twins and then they said, oh my God,

15:19.280 --> 15:22.320
Armie Hammer is the greatest actor of our generation.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.360
We're going to clone him.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.080
That's what's great.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.760
It, you know, they didn't do that in the CGI.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.160
The CGI, um, wasn't good enough for, for their standards.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.760
So if you look, if you actually watch the movie, if you pause it and jump forward like

15:33.760 --> 15:38.320
a frame at a time, you can tell it's actually, that's just one shot, right?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.800
And Armie Hammer is just moving very quickly.

15:40.800 --> 15:47.440
Oh, he's just cause a film, a film is displayed in 60 frames per second.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.360
So he is, uh, 120 times per second moving to the left and right.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.760
And it's just him.

15:53.760 --> 15:58.880
If you, if you look at his, uh, special skills sheet under his, uh, resume on the back of

15:58.880 --> 16:04.320
his headshot, it's like juggling some Spanish hyper-frame shifting.

16:04.320 --> 16:04.560
Yeah.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.600
Face, face stepping.

16:07.600 --> 16:13.120
And he draws, draws a picture of like a lightning bolt next to it on every resume.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.480
Just to, just to heighten it, I guess, or to make it seem more special.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.600
There's a lot of actors that can do that.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.200
Is that why you put the smiley face stickers on there?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.080
No, yeah.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.440
I'm a super good actor.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.560
A number one.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.520
And then he puts a scratch and sniff sticker that smells like he does.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.520
I will come to set every day, guarantee.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.320
Guarantee to smell like this.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.120
The Armie Hammer guarantee is that I will smell like this every day.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.720
This is my agent, Armie Hammer.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.320
How about another question?

16:34.320 --> 16:35.680
I feel like we did really good on that one.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.120
Hey brothers.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.720
So I'll get straight to the point.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.280
I've been dating this guy I was friends with for about three months now.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.320
Nothing official yet.

16:42.320 --> 16:48.320
But anyways, while on a date, he randomly brings up a gift bag with a handmade purse made for me.

16:48.960 --> 16:53.120
It's one of those jean bags you make out of cutting the legs off of some jeans.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.520
It's super sweet.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.520
I really appreciate the sentiment.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.600
Is it really my style?

16:59.600 --> 17:00.080
No.

17:00.080 --> 17:05.600
So the question is, when would be an appropriate situation to use the bag?

17:06.320 --> 17:07.440
Thanks so much.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.240
Huge fan muddled in Mexico.

17:10.240 --> 17:17.120
I think when you need to transport a disembodied butt, that would be a good place to put that.

17:17.120 --> 17:22.320
I love that when I read this question going through the emails, for some reason,

17:22.320 --> 17:27.120
now it makes sense to me that you cut the legs off all the way like at, you know, the hip.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.400
So it just forms the back.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.680
You dumb bastard.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.200
Cutting it like jorts.

17:31.200 --> 17:35.040
And so like you could put like stuff in one leg or in the other one.

17:35.040 --> 17:35.360
Yeah.

17:35.360 --> 17:40.080
Yeah, which leg do I keep my chapstick in?

17:40.080 --> 17:44.880
I bet the punctuation on this is after he gave her the bag,

17:44.880 --> 17:47.520
he stood up to reveal that he was just wearing jean chaps.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.080
Is it possible you were friends with him?

17:52.080 --> 17:53.760
Is it possible he's fucking with you?

17:55.120 --> 17:58.080
I mean, and he was like, I know this isn't your style.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.600
Like he knew it wasn't your style.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.880
And he was like, oh, this is ironic.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.920
This is funny because she wouldn't normally carry this kind of thing.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.840
I'm going to give it to her and see how she reacts.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.240
I think she'll laugh about it.

18:08.240 --> 18:12.320
She probably saw like a, he probably saw like a BuzzFeed post of like easy craft gifts that

18:12.320 --> 18:14.720
you can make for a new girlfriend.

18:14.720 --> 18:21.920
And then for some reason, the demented author of that terrible post wrote cut, make a purse,

18:21.920 --> 18:22.880
make a butt purse.

18:22.880 --> 18:23.360
That's what it is.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.000
It's a button.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.040
I don't want to mince words.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.320
It's a butt purse.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.600
It's a butt purse in a thing that butts go in.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.480
Typically.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.440
Listen, I, if you're really serious about this fella,

18:33.440 --> 18:37.360
I think you need to adjust your style because there is no guarantee that you're not going

18:37.360 --> 18:39.680
to keep receiving handmade jean gifts.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.240
Yeah.

18:40.240 --> 18:46.320
A lot of, you know, there are a lot of ladies out there that would just go crazy for some

18:46.320 --> 18:47.440
handmade jean gifts.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.480
No, no, Justin.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.120
I'm going to disagree with you slightly.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.560
And that I'm going to disagree with you completely.

18:54.560 --> 18:54.800
Okay.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.760
So not like a little bit, like the whole.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.080
Yeah, like a hundred percent, 180.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.040
Whole enchilada.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.320
One direction, two directions.

19:02.320 --> 19:02.960
Yeah.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.800
And I think that that's this early on in the, they've only been going out three months.

19:06.800 --> 19:11.200
I think that this is kind of a scattershot approach to see what she likes.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.000
And it's an opportunity to be like, okay, gave her the purse.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.680
She's not using that.

19:15.680 --> 19:15.920
Okay.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.440
So I'll scratch that off.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.240
That's a weird.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.440
Some scented oils.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.600
That's a weird baseline.

19:21.600 --> 19:26.640
When you're trying to like figure out what your new lover loves, you start with a butt

19:26.640 --> 19:27.040
bag.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.320
No, no.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.120
It is a huge jump.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.880
You should work backwards.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.280
It's like if you play, guess who?

19:35.280 --> 19:39.920
And it's like, do they look like they're hiding some sadness?

19:39.920 --> 19:41.120
And that's like your first question.

19:41.120 --> 19:41.760
And guess who?

19:41.760 --> 19:42.880
Not are they a man or woman?

19:42.880 --> 19:44.080
Do they have glasses?

19:44.080 --> 19:45.280
Well, but imagine, okay.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.800
If you say, do they have glasses?

19:46.800 --> 19:50.000
And the answer is yes, which by the way, who the fuck picks someone with glasses for that

19:50.000 --> 19:50.880
very risk.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.360
But if the answer is yes, you've just narrowed it down.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.840
If you give butt purse and she's like, I love the butt purse.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.640
I love butt purse.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.800
You know everything about that person.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.760
Nailed it in one.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.480
Yeah.

20:00.480 --> 20:00.720
Yeah.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.080
It's a good point trap.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.000
It's a, listen, it's a risky gambit.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.880
I know that, but if it lands, if it lands, you're set.

20:08.880 --> 20:09.200
You are set.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.880
Butt purses for life.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.000
Is it possible that this person has a, like a blossom fetish?

20:16.640 --> 20:19.040
Hey, why don't you wear this floppy hat tonight?

20:19.040 --> 20:21.680
Just wear this.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.040
I'm going to also wear a weird hat and I'm going to talk very fast.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.160
And we are going to make love.

20:26.160 --> 20:26.400
Whoa.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.880
I don't know, man.

20:28.880 --> 20:33.120
Can you use it for like, maybe like a diaper bag in the far, in the far future?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.040
That might be okay.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.800
Cause that's kind of like putting butts in a bag.

20:37.440 --> 20:42.160
You could use it for like, if you go on a trip and you want to like have stuff in the car.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.880
So like he'll see it, but no one else ever will.

20:44.880 --> 20:48.240
You could use it somewhere where you think there's a high probability of being mugged.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.440
Yeah.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.800
Give me everything in the bag.

20:50.800 --> 20:51.600
No, please.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.680
Let me simplify this for you.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.480
Take my, take my heart, take my legs.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.760
Legs.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.320
Not my, not my special butt bag for my lover.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.760
It could be a theft deterrent where it's like, give me your purse.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.040
Wait, no, nevermind.

21:05.040 --> 21:05.280
Bye.

21:06.000 --> 21:06.640
Okay, fine.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.120
All right, fine.

21:07.120 --> 21:07.520
You win.

21:07.520 --> 21:11.520
I'll just take all the things inside the bag and you can keep, uh, you shh.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.400
I got a lot of stuff in here.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.200
You only got two hands.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.240
It's going to be a lot more convenient.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.000
Take the bag, take the butt bag.

21:16.000 --> 21:16.880
Please take the butt bag.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.080
I guess you could call it a fanny pack.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.200
Oh, good.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.120
Just what this bit needed, Travis.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.720
A fanny pack.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.520
Start again.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.320
I'm lost.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.080
Okay.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.120
So like he's saying-

21:31.120 --> 21:33.760
My coworkers are constantly going out to eat for lunch.

21:33.760 --> 21:39.600
I try not to usually do to costs and health reasons, but they aren't, but they are always

21:39.600 --> 21:43.600
offering to pay or seeming super disappointed when I turn them down.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.520
While I appreciate their generosity, the guilt I'm saddled with after receiving a lot of free

21:47.520 --> 21:50.160
meals isn't exactly pleasant either.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.600
And I often can't afford to pay for a meal in return.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.280
How do I mitigate this situation?

21:55.280 --> 21:58.080
My wallet, conscience, and waistline are all on the line here.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.160
And that's from Treated in Tucky.

22:00.160 --> 22:00.880
That's good.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.600
I like that.

22:02.720 --> 22:10.240
Um, tell them to fucking who, why does somebody care so much about what you're eating all the

22:10.240 --> 22:10.800
time?

22:10.800 --> 22:11.840
You have to go.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.160
But they feel guilty.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.200
They don't want to have to listen.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.120
They don't want to get free rides from their coworkers.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.000
That's uncomfortable.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.880
I get that.

22:18.880 --> 22:23.280
But they also don't want to fucking pay for bottomless apps at TGI Fridays.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.120
Every fucking day of their life.

22:26.000 --> 22:26.320
Okay.

22:26.320 --> 22:31.520
But what it sounds like to me is that idea of them like saying, whoop, hey, come on,

22:31.520 --> 22:35.760
is that they see it as a very social, like team building thing.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.560
Right.

22:36.560 --> 22:40.160
And like, they don't want you to feel left out.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.960
They're trying to like make you feel included.

22:42.960 --> 22:46.320
Whereas you're looking at like, nah, I'm happy to hang out.

22:46.320 --> 22:52.400
I just don't want to go out to eat every day, which makes total sense to me.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.240
This sounds to me suspiciously like a free introductory offer.

22:56.240 --> 23:01.520
I feel like you're going to get there, enjoy some like bottomless French onion soup or

23:01.520 --> 23:02.240
something.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.640
And then at the end they think, boy, it wasn't this fun.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.080
We're, we're happy to pay this time, but I feel like we could really keep these good

23:08.080 --> 23:08.640
times going.

23:08.640 --> 23:14.000
If we could just get you to commit to six meals per month and get on this timeshare

23:14.000 --> 23:18.960
at TGI, this TGI Friday timeshare with us, then we think that this could really be the

23:18.960 --> 23:19.840
start of something big.

23:19.840 --> 23:24.080
Two weeks out of every year, this appetizer plate could be yours.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.280
This could be your appetizer plate.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.760
The other 50 weeks, people are going to touch it.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.120
And that's not great.

23:31.120 --> 23:31.760
I'll be honest.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.520
I don't love that part of the arrangement.

23:33.520 --> 23:37.600
Can you brown bag it every day, but make it look special?

23:38.240 --> 23:38.960
Ooh.

23:38.960 --> 23:39.360
Ooh.

23:39.360 --> 23:46.560
Tell them like a sick family member made like, my nanny made me, I can't say nanny, my nana

23:46.560 --> 23:48.960
made me like the sandwich that I feel so guilty.

23:48.960 --> 23:53.840
My adult nanny, my adult babysitter made this for me.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.560
She's very sick.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.160
Poppins would be really disappointed.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.040
That's going to work for, that's going to work for a week, Traff.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.240
That's not a long-term solution.

24:00.240 --> 24:04.240
Cause after four months, you're like, yeah, nanny, my adult babysitter is still pretty

24:04.240 --> 24:04.640
sick.

24:04.640 --> 24:09.280
So I better, no, then you have to dress up as the babysitter and come into work and be

24:09.280 --> 24:13.840
like, oh, he doesn't want to go out to lunch with you.

24:13.840 --> 24:19.840
Michael, I can't help but notice my special lunch remains uneaten here.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.240
Oh man.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.040
Can you go to the, okay.

24:25.040 --> 24:25.440
Okay.

24:25.440 --> 24:25.680
Okay.

24:25.680 --> 24:25.920
Okay.

24:25.920 --> 24:26.240
Okay.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.200
Okay.

24:27.200 --> 24:32.080
You go to the bathroom, you dress up as your adult nanny, Mrs.

24:32.080 --> 24:40.160
Doubtfire too, and then you carry a brown bag lunch in and put it on your desk and maybe

24:40.160 --> 24:43.680
loudly announce, oh, I was so delighted to make this.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.160
I sure hope Michael enjoys it.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.800
Lunch, lunch time for my little piggy.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.080
Where is that sweet piggy?

24:52.080 --> 24:54.880
I never seem to see him around.

24:54.880 --> 24:59.120
Have you ever noticed how you never see us in the same place at the same time?

24:59.840 --> 25:01.440
Well, I need to go shit.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.840
I'm going to go shit for five minutes.

25:07.840 --> 25:12.240
I had some bad Mexican food at that restaurant you're always trying to get Michael to go

25:12.240 --> 25:12.400
to.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.520
You might expect me to leave at the front door.

25:16.160 --> 25:20.880
I ate there once in 1987 and haven't stopped shitting since.

25:20.880 --> 25:21.360
Goodbye.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.560
I'm going to go climb out the bathroom window.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.240
Have you guys ever noticed how Michael's adult nanny, Mrs.

25:28.240 --> 25:32.720
Doubtfire too, seems to only enter and exit the building via the men's bathroom?

25:33.360 --> 25:37.120
I just went in the men's bathroom and I just saw her clothes lying on the ground.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.840
I think she shit herself out of her body.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.120
Is this the start of Left Behind?

25:44.480 --> 25:46.720
Has Mrs. Doubtfire too been raptured?

25:48.720 --> 25:49.520
Oh, man.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.400
I think that'll work.

25:53.120 --> 25:53.760
Yep.

25:53.760 --> 25:57.280
I know we were joking, but now I'm like ruminating on and I think that'll actually be great.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.800
I think it makes a lot of sense.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.000
Should we go to the money zone?

26:00.000 --> 26:11.280
I want to, yes.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.000
Listen, you tried Hulu on your computer.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.120
Everybody has.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.400
Check out this crazy video.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.040
You won't believe it.

26:17.040 --> 26:17.760
It's on Hulu.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.840
But Hulu Plus is like that, but better.

26:22.480 --> 26:26.320
They've got all the current season episodes of your favorite shows like Modern Family,

26:26.320 --> 26:29.120
The Daily Show, all that good stuff.

26:29.120 --> 26:35.840
And they've got some series every episode like South Park, and it's just exclusively

26:35.840 --> 26:40.320
available through Hulu Plus every episode of South Park, believe it or not.

26:40.880 --> 26:44.160
There's tons of ways you can watch Hulu Plus.

26:44.160 --> 26:49.520
There's Apple TV, Roku, on your smart TV, whatever, however you want to do it.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.880
What's awesome is they have new stuff and they also have tons of like old shows that

26:52.880 --> 26:54.160
you're not going to find anywhere else.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.120
I'm really excited because they have a show called The Supersizers Go that Teresa and

26:57.120 --> 27:00.240
I just love and for a long time we couldn't find it anywhere.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.280
Oh, did they add that?

27:01.280 --> 27:02.400
It's on Hulu Plus.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.360
Yeah, it's amazing.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.920
They have episodes of QI with Steven with Steven.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.800
Yeah, they have Penn and Teller's bullshit like every episode.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.160
It's really amazing.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.360
So it's not only worth it to keep up with new stuff, but you're going to find stuff

27:15.360 --> 27:16.880
on there that you're not going to find anywhere else.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.320
They also got original stuff they got.

27:18.320 --> 27:23.440
There's a new season of The Awesomes, the cartoon from Seth Meyers.

27:23.440 --> 27:27.200
You might know him from late night television.

27:27.200 --> 27:32.400
They have all 10 episodes of the first season so you can get prepped for that new joint on

27:32.400 --> 27:33.360
August 4th.

27:33.360 --> 27:38.880
Listen, this is $8 a month and that is very, very reasonable for the amount of stuff you're

27:38.880 --> 27:42.240
getting, but we can give you a two week free trial.

27:42.240 --> 27:46.880
Just go to huluplus.com slash my brother, huluplus.com slash my brother.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.840
I can't stress enough, it's important that you use that code because that says like,

27:51.840 --> 27:54.960
hey, my brother, my brother, it's worth it.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.040
Yeah, they'll keep giving us money also, which is like that.

27:59.040 --> 27:59.520
I'll be honest.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.240
That's what I like.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.280
I like that part.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.480
I like money, too.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.040
And if you want money, you know the best way to get it.

28:06.080 --> 28:06.720
Coding.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.680
That's right.

28:07.680 --> 28:11.520
Coding has become the most desired job skill of 2014.

28:11.520 --> 28:17.040
Man, do you mean coating like you would put something onto something covered in chocolate?

28:17.040 --> 28:22.000
No, coding like bits and bytes and boops and bleeps.

28:22.000 --> 28:22.480
Coding.

28:23.200 --> 28:28.720
And the easiest way to learn coding, in our opinion, my opinion, is one month HTML.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.560
It's the easiest way to learn to build websites.

28:30.560 --> 28:34.160
What you do is you guarantee them 30 minutes a day for 30 days.

28:34.160 --> 28:34.800
And you know what?

28:34.800 --> 28:37.920
Most of the lessons, you don't even have to do 30 minutes.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.280
Justin, you've been doing it, right?

28:39.280 --> 28:39.680
I have.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.400
I'm halfway through one month HTML.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.800
You have an actual website built day one.

28:44.800 --> 28:45.840
You build something.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.120
Are you ready to drop that URL on the air?

28:49.680 --> 28:50.000
Yes.

28:50.000 --> 28:50.720
Oh, yes.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.360
Thank you, Griffin.

28:51.360 --> 28:56.560
If you go to JustinMcElroy.net, you will be able to see my personal website that I built

28:57.120 --> 28:58.720
with one month HTML.

28:58.720 --> 28:59.920
It's got everything.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.920
It's got photos.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.360
It's got video.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.720
It's got links.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.720
It's like the Hayden Christensen of websites.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.800
It's got fun flash games for children.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.320
It's got everything.

29:10.320 --> 29:15.280
And there's a community of 12,000 people, other students, learning online.

29:15.280 --> 29:20.960
And the cool thing, I finished this project, this website, and I sent it in.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.640
You know, it is a correspondence course, but you do get a lot of feedback.

29:24.640 --> 29:29.760
I sent in my website, and they actually sent back like a five minute long video where they

29:29.760 --> 29:34.960
just sort of walked through my code and made some suggestions for things that I could tweak

29:34.960 --> 29:35.360
and fix.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.080
That's awesome.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.280
Yeah, it's incredible.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.440
And they've got a lot of other courses.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.840
They've got one month rails and other.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.760
That's the one I'm going to dip into that, I think.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.260
Yeah.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.740
I've learned Ruby on Rails and a lot of other stuff.

29:48.020 --> 29:54.820
You can go to onemonth.com slash my brother and get 25% off of one of these courses.

29:55.780 --> 29:57.860
That's a pretty great deal.

29:57.860 --> 30:02.580
So one month HTML, 30 minutes a day for 30 days, and you will learn one of these programming

30:02.580 --> 30:06.420
languages and you will be a lot more valuable as an employee.

30:06.420 --> 30:13.220
And you get a one time 25% discount on your class if you go to onemonth.com slash my brother.

30:13.220 --> 30:14.340
Justin, I have to warn you.

30:15.460 --> 30:21.220
Lesson I learned the other day, don't ever tweet about what you think about a coding

30:21.220 --> 30:24.980
language because I tweeted about PHP and how confusing I thought it was.

30:24.980 --> 30:26.900
I started a fucking firestorm.

30:27.460 --> 30:28.740
I did not know that.

30:28.740 --> 30:34.420
I mean, apparently coding languages are the new like Sega and Nintendo argument from the

30:34.420 --> 30:34.980
early 90s.

30:34.980 --> 30:35.300
Really?

30:35.300 --> 30:36.260
A lot of people want to weigh in on that.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.340
A lot of people are like, yeah, PHP is dirt.

30:38.340 --> 30:41.300
A lot of people are like, my dad is made out of PHP.

30:41.300 --> 30:44.980
Like it got fucking it got fucking real in my Twitter feed.

30:44.980 --> 30:51.140
Hypothetically, is there a video or website one could go to to find out what any of this

30:51.140 --> 30:51.460
means?

30:52.260 --> 30:56.580
I mean, just like say someone were really bad at interneting, right?

30:56.580 --> 30:58.980
No, I think that's all I think that's what one month is.

30:58.980 --> 30:59.860
You start starting.

30:59.860 --> 31:01.140
I have to go to there.

31:01.140 --> 31:01.380
Yeah.

31:02.580 --> 31:09.860
I have a message for Samuel Kay from Mallory who says it's not your birthday, but I didn't

31:09.860 --> 31:12.900
want to wait six goddamn months to wish you a good one.

31:14.020 --> 31:19.860
Here's to many more Let's Plays and anime podcasts, anime podcasts, sorry, together

31:19.860 --> 31:24.100
in the coming years and rest assured in the very distant future when you finally kick

31:24.100 --> 31:29.300
the bucket, I'll skin you, wear you like a coat and play an elaborately cruel prank

31:29.300 --> 31:30.260
on your loved ones.

31:30.260 --> 31:31.140
Hail Satan.

31:33.380 --> 31:37.460
Everything about this makes this one of the top 10 money zone spots we've ever had.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.340
Yeah, no, that's really good.

31:38.340 --> 31:43.860
And I tell you why, she has a very comprehensive plan for Samuel for his whole life.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.780
And that's a true friend right there.

31:45.780 --> 31:48.660
I also love it when people can't wait to give us money.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.420
I can't.

31:50.420 --> 31:52.180
You know, she's going to come right back around.

31:53.780 --> 31:55.060
That's the thing about money zone.

31:55.060 --> 31:58.420
Like first taste, you know, it's like you get a taste for it.

31:58.420 --> 31:59.620
You won't even have anything to say.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.780
Like that dude last week, he was like, hit me up on my Moby.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.820
It was like, I don't actually want to say this.

32:04.820 --> 32:06.820
I just want to keep giving the McRoy brothers money.

32:06.820 --> 32:07.780
Can you stop?

32:07.780 --> 32:11.460
Can you not edit the greatest money zone message ever, please?

32:11.460 --> 32:12.020
What was it?

32:12.580 --> 32:14.900
Thanks for vibing it and keeping it tight.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.420
If you need me, I'm on my mobile.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.140
So good.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.340
That is the mark.

32:20.340 --> 32:23.060
I got to say, Mallory, you came awfully close.

32:23.940 --> 32:24.420
Solo wit.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.820
Let's see if Vincent Longa can dethrone.

32:27.700 --> 32:32.100
And I got a message for Alicia Longa.

32:32.100 --> 32:32.660
Okay.

32:32.660 --> 32:36.020
So they're obviously related.

32:36.020 --> 32:36.820
Some fashion.

32:36.820 --> 32:37.700
Let's dig a little.

32:37.700 --> 32:41.220
Let's crack this mystery with the next sentence right below.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.380
Happy Dirty 30, my lovely wife.

32:43.380 --> 32:45.060
You got me a Vita for my bday.

32:45.060 --> 32:50.500
So I got the brothers McRoy to say happy bday to you on our favorite podcast,

32:50.500 --> 32:55.380
which I feel is better than last year's evening at Medieval Times.

32:55.380 --> 32:55.860
Disagree.

32:56.660 --> 32:57.300
Incorrect.

32:57.940 --> 33:00.740
Medieval Times is the greatest restaurant that's ever existed.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.260
Here's to another awesome year.

33:02.260 --> 33:04.980
And remember, just because it's your birthday doesn't mean

33:04.980 --> 33:07.780
you can put your finger in my belly button hole.

33:08.660 --> 33:09.460
Gross.

33:09.460 --> 33:10.900
That's happy bday.

33:10.900 --> 33:11.780
Happy bday.

33:11.780 --> 33:13.380
Don't put your finger in there.

33:13.380 --> 33:17.060
It's where, like, all of your parasites go to chill.

33:17.060 --> 33:20.820
It's like a hot tub for your body's billion parasites.

33:20.820 --> 33:22.340
So maybe just think about that.

33:22.340 --> 33:24.260
Congratulations on the Vita, though.

33:24.260 --> 33:25.700
So it's a nice little platform.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.380
Why don't you guys go to Medieval Times?

33:27.380 --> 33:29.060
If there's a Medieval Times close to you,

33:29.060 --> 33:31.380
you should be there every day supporting the Green Knight.

33:32.020 --> 33:34.180
Yeah, you're a Green Knight, man.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.700
Oh, God. All day long.

33:35.700 --> 33:36.420
All day, every day.

33:36.420 --> 33:37.780
It's the only sport I care about.

33:38.660 --> 33:41.540
If they televised Medieval Times, oof.

33:41.540 --> 33:43.220
Basically, the only thing I want to do with my life

33:43.220 --> 33:45.300
is go to Medieval Times, and it's never happened.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.020
You've never been?

33:46.900 --> 33:50.420
When I say that sometimes, and people think it's like,

33:50.420 --> 33:53.940
when I said I really wanted to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Club in New York,

33:53.940 --> 33:55.940
and everybody thought, like, oh, how fun and ironic.

33:55.940 --> 33:57.700
Like, no, you don't know me at all.

33:57.700 --> 33:58.580
You don't get it.

33:58.580 --> 33:59.380
You don't get me.

33:59.380 --> 34:04.020
God, when we do our live shows, we have to go to one of our Medieval Times.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.260
Can we rent out the whole Medieval Times?

34:06.260 --> 34:07.380
And will they let us knight?

34:08.340 --> 34:09.460
Can we knight it up?

34:09.460 --> 34:10.980
I don't want to knight.

34:11.620 --> 34:12.180
Yes, you do.

34:12.820 --> 34:14.180
Look deep within yourself.

34:14.180 --> 34:15.620
I was just Googling Green Knight

34:15.620 --> 34:18.020
because I thought it was the name of the Martin Lawrence film.

34:18.020 --> 34:20.660
But no, of course that was Black Knight was the name of that film.

34:20.660 --> 34:21.540
And I fucked that up.

34:21.540 --> 34:23.620
I fucked that up right proper.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.860
Yeah, not good work there.

34:25.860 --> 34:26.580
This is Biz.

34:26.580 --> 34:27.460
And I'm Teresa.

34:27.460 --> 34:31.860
And we host a show called One Bad Mother, a comedy podcast about parenting.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.860
Not a parenting podcast.

34:33.860 --> 34:34.740
Guess what?

34:34.740 --> 34:36.340
We both just had babies.

34:36.900 --> 34:37.300
Again.

34:38.580 --> 34:44.180
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike on iTunes or MaximumFun.org.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.380
Listen, guys, how about another Yahoo?

34:47.380 --> 34:49.300
I feel like we've only had one this episode.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.340
You feel like that because we did.

34:50.340 --> 34:57.620
It did, but this Yahoo is sent in by level 466 Yahoo Shaman Drew Davenport.

34:58.980 --> 34:59.300
Thank you.

34:59.300 --> 35:01.300
Can we just start calling them Yajurus?

35:01.300 --> 35:07.060
Yajurus, if it's not from, as long as it's from Drew, let's just call them Yajurus.

35:07.060 --> 35:11.220
Okay, this Yajuru was asked by Yahoo answers user Leia, who asks.

35:12.820 --> 35:13.460
Oh, fuck.

35:13.460 --> 35:21.220
Fuck, is lava real?

35:21.220 --> 35:23.860
I've just finished watching the film Shrek.

35:24.500 --> 35:28.340
And there was a scene in the movie where there was a dragon and lava.

35:28.340 --> 35:31.700
And I was just wondering if you can get lava in real life.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.460
Also, are Shrek slash Ogres real?

35:36.820 --> 35:38.580
Okay, this isn't a crazy question.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.220
Lava does seem very weird.

35:41.220 --> 35:42.980
Yeah, let me ask both of you.

35:42.980 --> 35:44.420
Y'all ever seen lava?

35:44.420 --> 35:45.300
I have not.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.500
I have not seen lava.

35:46.500 --> 35:46.900
Travis?

35:47.940 --> 35:50.100
I've seen it on like the TV.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.140
Oh, fuck, no.

35:51.140 --> 35:52.820
Have you felt it's radiant heat?

35:54.180 --> 35:54.420
No.

35:55.060 --> 35:55.940
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

35:55.940 --> 35:57.140
Could be Hollywood bullshit.

35:57.140 --> 36:01.300
Now, Griffin, to be fair, there's lots of things I've never seen in real life.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.060
But lava seems kind of fantastical, right?

36:05.060 --> 36:06.580
They say it's rock.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.420
I ain't never seen a fucking rock move like that.

36:08.420 --> 36:09.700
It's a plasma, isn't it?

36:09.700 --> 36:11.460
It falls within that category.

36:11.460 --> 36:13.780
I think it's a plasmoid.

36:13.780 --> 36:14.660
It's a plasmid.

36:15.220 --> 36:16.020
It's a plasmid.

36:16.740 --> 36:17.780
It is a plasmid.

36:17.780 --> 36:21.460
There are times where I'll get confused on issues like this.

36:21.460 --> 36:24.980
I will sometimes forget, and please don't make fun,

36:25.620 --> 36:28.580
but I will sometimes forget if unicorns are real or not.

36:28.580 --> 36:31.700
Not to say that there are unicorns today,

36:31.700 --> 36:35.540
but I will sometimes have brief moments where I try to remember

36:35.540 --> 36:38.260
if that is a historical animal that is no longer extant

36:38.260 --> 36:41.220
or if it is, you know.

36:41.220 --> 36:44.180
Now, Justin, in your defense, here's the thing.

36:44.180 --> 36:51.700
A horse with a horn on its head versus a giant 40-foot tall dinosaur

36:51.700 --> 36:54.340
with giant sharp teeth and huge...

36:54.340 --> 36:57.540
It's like, which one's a little bit more believable that it actually existed?

36:57.540 --> 37:00.500
Yeah, we have horses with horns on their head.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.340
They're called deer and moose.

37:02.340 --> 37:02.660
Yeah.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.060
That's very believable to me.

37:05.060 --> 37:08.900
But that's what's always crazy if I might lay my cards on the table.

37:08.900 --> 37:09.380
Yeah.

37:09.380 --> 37:11.620
People, dinosaurs, totally accept it.

37:11.620 --> 37:12.980
You talk about dragons and everyone's like,

37:12.980 --> 37:15.620
ha ha ha, this guy and dragons.

37:15.620 --> 37:17.300
Yeah, guess what a pterodactyl was?

37:17.300 --> 37:18.340
A fucking dragon.

37:18.340 --> 37:18.900
It's a dragon.

37:18.900 --> 37:19.780
Yeah, it's a fucking dragon right there.

37:19.780 --> 37:20.740
How about narwhals?

37:20.740 --> 37:23.060
Like, narwhals are whales with unicorn horns.

37:23.060 --> 37:23.560
Uh-huh.

37:24.180 --> 37:28.900
Why is it so preposterous to think that unicorns may have been around?

37:29.620 --> 37:30.120
Yeah.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.660
A bigfoot is just like a gorilla person.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.020
Yeah, that can happen.

37:34.020 --> 37:35.060
Yeah, that can happen.

37:35.060 --> 37:39.140
A super hairy dude loses his fucking mind and wanders into the forest.

37:39.140 --> 37:39.620
What's up?

37:39.620 --> 37:40.260
That's a bigfoot.

37:40.260 --> 37:41.700
I don't give a fuck what you want to call it.

37:41.700 --> 37:42.340
Now it's a bigfoot.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.780
Now you are a bigfoot.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.100
A long-nosed monster was a plesiosaurus.

37:46.100 --> 37:48.660
You get a super tall goat that only has the one horn.

37:49.780 --> 37:52.500
I don't care what the fuck you like scientifically.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.300
That's a phylum korygongan.

37:55.300 --> 37:57.220
No, that's a fucking unicorn.

37:57.220 --> 38:01.620
I don't need to like splice its fucking DNA and be like,

38:01.620 --> 38:04.500
oh, that G and C are next to that A, so that's not a unicorn.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.340
It's clearly the goat phylum.

38:06.340 --> 38:07.060
No, that's a-

38:07.060 --> 38:08.900
You know there's a fish with arms?

38:09.460 --> 38:09.960
Yeah.

38:10.660 --> 38:12.020
That's a mermaid, guys.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.780
Yeah, that is a mermaid.

38:13.780 --> 38:15.940
I mean, like, alligator, basically, is a-

38:15.940 --> 38:17.380
Have you ever seen an okapi?

38:17.380 --> 38:17.700
Yeah.

38:17.700 --> 38:18.420
Okapi?

38:18.420 --> 38:18.980
Yeah.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.500
It looks like two animals put together.

38:21.060 --> 38:22.500
That right there is a griffin, my man.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.300
That's a griffin.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.700
So deal with that.

38:26.420 --> 38:29.220
But fucking liquid hot rocks?

38:29.220 --> 38:29.700
No way!

38:29.700 --> 38:30.740
That's unbelievable.

38:30.740 --> 38:31.620
That's crazy.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.060
Hi, I've seen rocks before.

38:33.060 --> 38:33.780
They're hard and cold.

38:33.780 --> 38:36.020
They're super, super hard.

38:36.020 --> 38:36.900
And cold.

38:36.900 --> 38:37.700
I got a-

38:37.700 --> 38:39.460
Sometimes they're liquid and really hot.

38:39.460 --> 38:40.260
Nah, sorry.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.940
I went over to a buddy of mine, his house.

38:43.940 --> 38:48.100
He made a hot rock out of like a big old smooth rock

38:48.100 --> 38:51.220
and he put it on some rock salt and put that in the oven

38:51.220 --> 38:52.660
and then we cooked wagyu beef on it.

38:52.660 --> 38:55.700
And what the weirdest thing is, when that rock came out of the oven,

38:55.700 --> 38:57.540
it wasn't a liquid, what?

38:58.340 --> 39:00.260
You know, I've gone down in the caves before

39:00.260 --> 39:01.540
and you know what they are?

39:01.540 --> 39:01.860
Cold.

39:01.860 --> 39:02.420
They're super cold.

39:02.420 --> 39:03.380
It's cold in there.

39:03.380 --> 39:03.780
It's weird.

39:03.780 --> 39:04.740
It's like the low you get.

39:04.740 --> 39:05.780
You go down into the earth, it's cold.

39:05.780 --> 39:07.380
It's almost like heat rises.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.220
Griffin put a-

39:09.220 --> 39:10.820
Okay, if you want to get something-

39:10.820 --> 39:14.020
Griffin put a rock into the hottest thing that there is

39:14.020 --> 39:16.420
because if you want to get something hot,

39:16.420 --> 39:18.420
there's only one thing you turn to, it's the oven.

39:18.420 --> 39:20.500
So nothing can get anything hotter than an oven.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.940
Yeah, they used to call it a microwave

39:21.940 --> 39:23.380
because it's called a microwave oven.

39:23.380 --> 39:24.020
Yeah, right.

39:24.020 --> 39:26.980
They used to just call it a hotter because that's what it is.

39:26.980 --> 39:30.100
It's the hottest way you can hot something is that.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.340
So he did that and then he put a rock in there

39:32.340 --> 39:33.220
and it didn't melt.

39:33.220 --> 39:34.100
So I don't know.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.500
You tell me where we're at.

39:36.500 --> 39:36.980
Science.

39:37.540 --> 39:38.020
It's weird.

39:38.580 --> 39:39.780
You think you're hot shit.

39:39.780 --> 39:40.740
You know what's hot shit?

39:40.740 --> 39:41.460
The oven.

39:41.460 --> 39:42.740
The oven is hot, okay?

39:43.540 --> 39:45.940
So let's talk about Mike Myers for a second.

39:47.540 --> 39:50.900
He's kind of let himself go, right?

39:50.900 --> 39:53.700
And at that point, like I know it was a movie role

39:53.700 --> 39:55.300
and it was Hollywood magic

39:55.300 --> 39:58.660
and then that movie wasn't technically live action.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.060
Technically, like there were human voices behind it.

40:01.060 --> 40:01.860
Fine, whatever.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.300
They looked human enough to me.

40:04.900 --> 40:07.060
At what point is Mike Myers stopping Mike Myers

40:07.060 --> 40:08.980
and start being Shrek, you know?

40:08.980 --> 40:10.500
He's done fucking nine of those now.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.220
He has spent, listen, the amount of time that goes in

40:13.220 --> 40:14.100
to recording those movies,

40:14.100 --> 40:15.620
he has spent more time being Shrek

40:15.620 --> 40:17.780
than he has not being Shrek, right?

40:17.780 --> 40:19.060
From what I've read on BuzzFeed,

40:19.060 --> 40:20.340
he's really hard to work with.

40:20.980 --> 40:24.900
So I guess you could say he's a bit of an ogre.

40:24.900 --> 40:25.380
Yeah.

40:25.380 --> 40:29.380
Yeah, food for thought.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.580
Why doesn't Mike Myers do movies anymore?

40:32.580 --> 40:33.780
Cause he's an ogre.

40:33.780 --> 40:34.340
He's an ogre.

40:34.340 --> 40:35.300
He's big and green.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.180
He only likes like playing with like earwax and stuff.

40:38.180 --> 40:39.940
It's been a while since I've seen the Shrek films.

40:40.500 --> 40:41.620
Mike, we're big fans.

40:41.620 --> 40:42.980
Mike, I love your work.

40:42.980 --> 40:43.780
Thank you for listening.

40:43.780 --> 40:45.540
Please don't eat my bones.

40:45.540 --> 40:48.340
Also, I've seen the trailer of Love Guru like 30 times.

40:48.340 --> 40:48.580
Yeah.

40:48.580 --> 40:49.940
Can't bring myself to watch the movie,

40:49.940 --> 40:51.140
but I'm kind of obsessed with it.

40:51.140 --> 40:51.860
It's a shame, right?

40:51.860 --> 40:55.620
Cause it's his last human movie.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.540
You can already see the transformation beginning.

40:58.100 --> 41:00.180
They try to cover it up with prosthetics, but no.

41:00.180 --> 41:01.380
No, he got-

41:01.380 --> 41:02.260
Can't hide his nature.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.180
He's got little wiggly funnels up there.

41:04.180 --> 41:05.780
I work at a small local restaurant.

41:05.780 --> 41:07.700
One of my coworkers doesn't wear deodorant.

41:07.700 --> 41:08.020
Oh.

41:08.020 --> 41:11.300
He says that he doesn't want all those chemicals in his body

41:11.300 --> 41:13.300
and I don't want to smell like a mall.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.500
I want to smell like a mall.

41:14.500 --> 41:15.860
I don't want to smell like a mall?

41:16.500 --> 41:17.140
A mall.

41:18.420 --> 41:21.460
Oh, does he mean like Hollister and like Abercrombie and Fit

41:21.460 --> 41:22.100
and they like-

41:22.100 --> 41:22.660
Exactly.

41:22.660 --> 41:23.060
Okay.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.980
Brands and commercialism, right?

41:24.980 --> 41:26.740
He wants to smell like a man.

41:26.740 --> 41:27.460
Like Doody.

41:27.460 --> 41:28.500
Like a dirt man.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.860
Like a Doody man.

41:29.860 --> 41:31.780
His body odor gets pretty bad.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.060
Yeah, I think that's connected.

41:33.620 --> 41:36.100
And I'm pretty sure customers notice.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.420
How do I help him realize that he needs to stop

41:38.420 --> 41:40.500
trying to pull off the McConaughey

41:40.500 --> 41:42.580
and utilize some smell goods?

41:42.580 --> 41:45.300
That's from smelling bad in San Antonio.

41:45.300 --> 41:45.780
Okay.

41:45.780 --> 41:48.100
Let me, wait, I just realized something.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.460
I didn't realize this putting together,

41:49.460 --> 41:51.780
but do you ever notice that sometimes without meaning to

41:51.780 --> 41:53.300
we have like theme episodes

41:53.300 --> 41:55.300
and this is the third question about a restaurant.

41:56.340 --> 41:57.460
That is restaurant life.

41:58.020 --> 41:59.540
We got a lot of restaurant questions.

41:59.540 --> 42:01.220
Can I just get out in front of this and say, I get it.

42:01.220 --> 42:03.780
And like, I've known people who did not use deodorant

42:03.780 --> 42:06.660
because maybe they have like super sensitive skin down there.

42:06.660 --> 42:08.980
Notice he's using the past tense, by the way, folks.

42:10.420 --> 42:10.900
No, I know.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.900
So I have a friend here in Austin who doesn't wear it

42:12.900 --> 42:16.020
just because like, they don't, they're not super crazy

42:16.020 --> 42:17.300
about having a bunch of chemicals in it.

42:17.300 --> 42:18.340
They have sensitive skin.

42:18.340 --> 42:18.900
I get it.

42:18.900 --> 42:19.700
I got sensitive skin.

42:19.700 --> 42:21.460
I only have like one or two brands of deodorant.

42:21.460 --> 42:25.300
I found that doesn't like, just like blow my shit up down there

42:25.300 --> 42:26.420
or in there, I should say.

42:27.460 --> 42:28.340
I totally get it.

42:28.340 --> 42:30.740
And I think that you, there are people who get away with it.

42:30.740 --> 42:31.700
Like my friend doesn't stink.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.100
It doesn't, he just doesn't,

42:34.100 --> 42:36.020
he just doesn't produce a lot of smell down there.

42:36.020 --> 42:38.180
But if you work in a fucking restaurant,

42:38.180 --> 42:40.900
like I think that's, I'm willing to give you credit,

42:40.900 --> 42:42.420
like do what you want, chase your bliss.

42:42.420 --> 42:44.180
But if you work in a restaurant, a place that like,

42:44.180 --> 42:45.700
it is kind of important that you,

42:45.700 --> 42:49.300
at least at the very minimum, don't affect the smell

42:49.300 --> 42:50.100
in the room.

42:50.740 --> 42:52.020
That you are smell neutral.

42:52.020 --> 42:55.060
You gotta be at zero smell on the pH scale.

42:57.060 --> 42:59.540
Yeah, that's a non-starter, guys.

42:59.540 --> 43:01.940
Ooh, I just had a million dollar idea.

43:01.940 --> 43:02.440
Okay.

43:03.140 --> 43:04.740
Deodorant that smells like food.

43:05.460 --> 43:06.180
Oh my God.

43:06.180 --> 43:08.740
So rather than you smell like, yeah,

43:08.740 --> 43:12.740
rather than smell like a mall, you smell like a food court.

43:12.740 --> 43:13.220
Justin.

43:13.220 --> 43:14.180
Check out my cinnamon pit.

43:14.180 --> 43:16.180
Justin, when he hit puberty before us,

43:16.180 --> 43:17.700
I remember this very distinctly.

43:18.260 --> 43:20.660
I had many occasions to smell Justin's armpits,

43:20.660 --> 43:22.420
and I think it was, he used to do the thing where he'd put

43:22.420 --> 43:24.580
his fingers in his armpits and then like put them in my face

43:24.580 --> 43:25.540
to make me smell them.

43:25.540 --> 43:27.620
And I always thought they smelled like ketchup.

43:28.420 --> 43:29.220
That's not a joke.

43:29.220 --> 43:32.660
I remember Justin's pit smelling like exactly like,

43:32.660 --> 43:35.300
or McDonald's, like that sugary ketchup.

43:36.420 --> 43:39.060
Justin once convinced me that in place of deodorant,

43:39.060 --> 43:41.940
you could rub orange peels in your armpits.

43:41.940 --> 43:42.980
Oh, Justin.

43:42.980 --> 43:44.980
And that shit burns.

43:44.980 --> 43:45.620
It hurts.

43:45.620 --> 43:46.660
You know, I've never thought about this,

43:46.660 --> 43:49.140
but Justin, you owe me like a hundred apologies for the

43:49.140 --> 43:50.900
terrible, terrible thing that you did to me.

43:50.900 --> 43:52.180
I'm very sorry.

43:54.820 --> 43:55.780
Does that count?

43:55.780 --> 43:56.280
No.

43:56.740 --> 43:57.700
Now here's the thing.

43:58.660 --> 44:01.220
I have a perfect, like a really great solution for this.

44:01.220 --> 44:01.700
Are you ready?

44:01.700 --> 44:02.200
Mm-hmm.

44:04.420 --> 44:11.460
You make this person, make this man some homemade natural

44:11.460 --> 44:17.620
deodorant as a gift, work really hard on it and make it

44:17.620 --> 44:19.140
special and put a bow on it.

44:20.020 --> 44:21.540
Here's a quick recipe.

44:21.540 --> 44:23.860
Three tablespoons, coconut oil, three tablespoons,

44:23.860 --> 44:26.420
baking soda, two tablespoons, shea butter, two tablespoons,

44:26.420 --> 44:27.700
arrow root and essential oils.

44:28.580 --> 44:33.620
Mix it on up and there's like some stove stuff here,

44:33.620 --> 44:35.220
but you can Google it or whatever.

44:35.220 --> 44:37.860
And then make him some natural deodorant as a gift,

44:37.860 --> 44:40.660
gift deodorant and put like a brand, make a fake label,

44:40.660 --> 44:43.700
like Jerry's natural, I'm assuming his name is Jerry,

44:43.700 --> 44:45.380
Jerry's natural stick.

44:46.340 --> 44:47.780
Do not smell like duty man.

44:47.780 --> 44:51.060
Jerry's special do not get fired ointment.

44:52.420 --> 44:55.140
Jerry's special, the customers are gagging bar.

44:55.140 --> 44:55.640
Yeah.

44:56.900 --> 44:58.500
That's the thing, like Griffin, you're absolutely,

44:58.500 --> 45:02.020
cause the friends I have that don't, they're very outdoorsy.

45:02.020 --> 45:03.300
They're very beachy.

45:03.300 --> 45:06.020
They live, you know, they spend a lot of time rock climbing

45:06.020 --> 45:06.820
and hiking through the woods.

45:06.820 --> 45:08.100
And ain't that some shit?

45:08.100 --> 45:11.620
Ain't that like that friend of mine is like kind of outdoorsy

45:11.620 --> 45:13.460
and like was camping and shit like that.

45:13.460 --> 45:14.500
And then he doesn't stink.

45:14.500 --> 45:18.260
And then I go see like an outdoor theater production

45:18.260 --> 45:20.980
and I fucking like smell like dog shit afterwards.

45:20.980 --> 45:23.540
Do you think it's like people who are really protective

45:23.540 --> 45:25.300
of their kids and keep them away from germs?

45:25.300 --> 45:27.860
So like their immune system is really weak.

45:27.860 --> 45:30.340
And like, that's the thing we're making our smell immune system

45:30.340 --> 45:31.940
really weak by putting on deodorant.

45:31.940 --> 45:35.780
And if you just embrace it, you become very protective.

45:35.780 --> 45:38.020
You're very defended against smell.

45:38.020 --> 45:38.820
I'm going to do this.

45:38.820 --> 45:42.340
I'm going to go off it and I'm going to write a memoir

45:42.340 --> 45:45.140
about that year that I went without deodorant.

45:45.140 --> 45:46.020
Eat, pray, stink.

45:46.020 --> 45:48.020
No, it's just going to be called my stinky year.

45:48.020 --> 45:50.660
And it's going to be a New York times bestseller.

45:50.660 --> 45:51.700
Watch out Elizabeth Gilbert.

45:52.340 --> 45:52.980
Who's that?

45:52.980 --> 45:53.460
Oh man.

45:53.460 --> 45:54.980
My book got bumped from number one.

45:54.980 --> 45:55.780
Who did it?

45:55.780 --> 45:58.340
My stinky year by Griffin McElroy.

45:58.340 --> 46:00.340
I never should have inspired him to chase his dreams.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.100
Too bad you did.

46:03.300 --> 46:04.500
You inspired me deeply.

46:04.500 --> 46:07.380
I just graduated college and I'm home for the summer

46:07.380 --> 46:08.260
as I search for jobs.

46:08.260 --> 46:10.260
So I was wondering what the proper protocol is

46:10.260 --> 46:11.540
for asking people on dates

46:11.540 --> 46:13.540
when I know I'll be leaving town in the fall.

46:13.540 --> 46:15.300
Is it weird if I start seeing people

46:15.300 --> 46:16.820
who are also still in college?

46:16.820 --> 46:19.220
That's from New Prospects in New Hampshire.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.300
The second thing, no, that's no.

46:21.300 --> 46:23.140
No, that's totally fine.

46:23.140 --> 46:26.820
The first thing I think that the key is being upfront.

46:27.380 --> 46:32.340
Like, like why, why spend three months like living like a monk

46:32.340 --> 46:34.180
just because you know, you've got to get like, yeah.

46:34.180 --> 46:35.620
Take someone out on a date.

46:35.620 --> 46:37.380
You're not proposing marriage.

46:37.380 --> 46:37.940
You know what I mean?

46:37.940 --> 46:38.740
And can I tell you something?

46:38.740 --> 46:41.700
That is like for a lot of people,

46:41.700 --> 46:43.620
especially people who are in college,

46:43.620 --> 46:48.260
that is going to be like a refreshingly liberating way

46:48.260 --> 46:49.380
to approach it.

46:49.380 --> 46:50.740
Like, listen, let's just,

46:50.740 --> 46:52.580
let's just get some practice in here

46:52.580 --> 46:54.420
and keep each other company.

46:54.420 --> 46:56.500
Hey, do you want to just have a good time

46:56.500 --> 46:58.420
with no expectations for the future?

46:58.420 --> 46:59.060
Well, don't say-

46:59.060 --> 47:00.420
Trying to like solve this shit.

47:00.420 --> 47:03.300
Do not say, do you want to have a good time?

47:03.300 --> 47:04.980
No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all.

47:04.980 --> 47:07.140
But I'm saying that that is the implication of the thing

47:07.140 --> 47:08.740
is like, you're just going to hang out

47:08.740 --> 47:11.780
and enjoy each other's company and it's cool.

47:11.780 --> 47:13.300
The great thing is that if you know

47:13.300 --> 47:15.700
that there's an expiration date on the relationship,

47:15.700 --> 47:17.140
you're going to get out there

47:17.140 --> 47:19.700
and you're going to make the most of the time

47:19.700 --> 47:21.460
you have together as a couple.

47:21.460 --> 47:24.180
You know, so many couples spend days

47:24.180 --> 47:25.700
idling away in front of the TV,

47:25.700 --> 47:27.460
but you're going to get out there, you know?

47:27.460 --> 47:29.940
You'll, you, you two will go skydiving.

47:29.940 --> 47:30.980
You could go Rocky Mountain.

47:30.980 --> 47:32.580
Oh Jesus, this every time.

47:32.580 --> 47:35.860
2.7 seconds on a bull man named Fu Manchu.

47:35.860 --> 47:36.100
Yeah.

47:37.140 --> 47:40.580
What I'm suggesting is to date like you were moving.

47:40.580 --> 47:40.820
Yeah.

47:41.700 --> 47:44.820
Can I bounce just a quick like devil's advocate

47:44.820 --> 47:45.780
off the two of you though?

47:46.500 --> 47:46.820
Uh-huh.

47:49.060 --> 47:49.780
What if it's love?

47:51.940 --> 47:55.300
Well, then it solves itself, right?

47:55.300 --> 47:55.700
Does it?

47:56.420 --> 47:57.460
Well, cause here's the thing.

47:57.460 --> 48:00.340
If it's love, then do you really want to run the risk

48:00.340 --> 48:01.540
of not finding it?

48:01.540 --> 48:04.180
Oh fuck, that's a good point Travis.

48:04.180 --> 48:05.940
That's a good point Travis.

48:05.940 --> 48:06.420
Thank you.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.780
I haven't watched the trailers

48:07.780 --> 48:10.100
for this Fault in Our Stars movie very closely,

48:10.100 --> 48:12.420
but I think this is about the same thing.

48:12.420 --> 48:14.340
Yeah, it's about two people who are moving.

48:14.340 --> 48:16.980
Two people who are moving and they decide to date each other

48:16.980 --> 48:18.420
even though they know they're moving.

48:18.420 --> 48:22.980
And it seems like, I mean, even if it doesn't pan out,

48:22.980 --> 48:24.660
you're still going to make a lot of green.

48:24.660 --> 48:26.580
It seems like those people are just raking in the devil.

48:26.580 --> 48:27.700
They're doing very, very good.

48:27.700 --> 48:29.300
Yeah, they're doing very well.

48:29.300 --> 48:32.260
So maybe try that.

48:32.260 --> 48:34.980
I think she's like training to be an astronaut or something

48:34.980 --> 48:36.820
cause she's got that oxygen tank.

48:36.820 --> 48:37.860
Yeah, she's going to the moon.

48:39.300 --> 48:43.220
And then she's just over the moon about this new fella.

48:44.180 --> 48:46.020
They should have called the movie Over the Moon.

48:46.020 --> 48:47.700
If they, I mean, if we're dealing with astronaut stuff,

48:47.700 --> 48:50.260
then typically you want to get some sort of space reference

48:50.260 --> 48:51.780
in there, but, oh, stars.

48:51.780 --> 48:51.940
Yeah.

48:51.940 --> 48:52.980
Sorry, stars, yeah.

48:52.980 --> 48:54.420
That's actually why she's going to,

48:55.220 --> 48:56.500
I just heard from the president.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.660
The sun is, the sun's all fucked up.

48:58.660 --> 49:02.260
The sun's all fucked up, but I have to go to space to fix it.

49:02.260 --> 49:04.420
There's a fault in our, are you saying yes?

49:04.980 --> 49:06.500
Yes, Dr. Mitchelson.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.180
There's a fault in our stars.

49:08.180 --> 49:08.580
Oh man.

49:10.100 --> 49:11.940
But also I'm dating this new guy,

49:11.940 --> 49:14.180
so we're going to see how that goes.

49:14.180 --> 49:15.620
So maybe I'll go fix it.

49:15.620 --> 49:16.740
Maybe I won't.

49:16.740 --> 49:18.580
But then at the end, spoiler, she does go fix it.

49:18.580 --> 49:22.260
We actually just described the exact plot

49:22.260 --> 49:24.020
of the Danny Boyle film, Sunshine.

49:25.940 --> 49:27.300
That was exactly what we just,

49:27.300 --> 49:28.660
the sun's all fucked up.

49:28.660 --> 49:30.100
We better fire a ship in it.

49:31.060 --> 49:31.940
You're welcome, Earth.

49:32.580 --> 49:34.100
And Armageddon, right?

49:34.100 --> 49:36.020
Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty good,

49:36.020 --> 49:36.740
I think that's the same thing.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.900
What's the movie where the center of the Earth,

49:38.900 --> 49:40.820
the magma stops spinning?

49:40.820 --> 49:44.100
Yeah, well, let me put it in quotes, magma.

49:44.740 --> 49:48.580
The magma, which sounds like a made up D&D monster.

49:48.580 --> 49:48.820
Yeah.

49:49.380 --> 49:52.100
This Yahoo was sent in by Troy Hoffmuckle.

49:52.100 --> 49:54.340
Thank you, Troy, for all of the submissions.

49:54.340 --> 49:57.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Trixie Bell.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.900
My jaw popped and I yawned while I said that.

50:00.900 --> 50:01.620
That was terrible.

50:01.620 --> 50:02.580
Trixie Bell asks,

50:04.180 --> 50:06.500
is it okay to take a five-year-old to a restaurant

50:06.500 --> 50:08.260
with suggestive names for the food?

50:09.940 --> 50:12.260
My husband and I are babysitting our five-year-old niece,

50:12.260 --> 50:13.620
and we want to go out to eat at this

50:13.620 --> 50:16.340
rock and roll diner kind of local place.

50:16.340 --> 50:17.540
It's a clean place.

50:17.540 --> 50:19.540
It's not like Hooters or anything,

50:19.540 --> 50:21.220
but all the menu items have suggestive

50:21.220 --> 50:23.060
or slightly inappropriate names.

50:23.060 --> 50:25.860
Like their chicken soup is called cock in a bowl,

50:26.660 --> 50:29.300
and their banana split is called banana hammock.

50:29.300 --> 50:31.060
Very suggestive.

50:31.060 --> 50:32.020
Do you get it?

50:32.020 --> 50:34.900
And another chicken dish called naked breast.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.140
Do you get the suggestion?

50:37.140 --> 50:37.860
This one's called-

50:37.860 --> 50:38.580
Do you get it?

50:38.580 --> 50:40.660
This one's called fat cock.

50:40.660 --> 50:41.300
Do you get it?

50:41.940 --> 50:44.820
This one's called a dick, and it's a hot dog.

50:44.820 --> 50:46.260
This one's called pussy.

50:46.260 --> 50:46.980
Do you get the-

50:46.980 --> 50:54.180
Sorry, can I just make a quick observation

50:54.180 --> 50:57.540
that cock in a bowl is not a thing.

50:57.540 --> 50:57.700
No.

50:57.700 --> 50:59.540
It's not like wink, wait, get it?

50:59.540 --> 51:00.820
A cock in a bowl.

51:00.820 --> 51:01.860
I think that's actually-

51:01.860 --> 51:03.860
It's not a clever play on words.

51:03.860 --> 51:06.020
I think that's what British people call

51:06.740 --> 51:07.620
missionary position.

51:07.620 --> 51:10.100
Cock in a bowl.

51:10.100 --> 51:11.380
Thank you, Travis.

51:11.380 --> 51:12.900
I was hoping one of us would do it.

51:14.260 --> 51:15.780
I just want to say this too.

51:15.780 --> 51:17.540
I want to defend Hooters for a minute.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.060
Have you ever been to a Hooters?

51:19.060 --> 51:20.100
They don't need-

51:20.100 --> 51:20.980
No, no, no.

51:20.980 --> 51:22.340
Have you ever been to a Hooters?

51:22.900 --> 51:26.500
I would say that that is less sexually explicit

51:27.060 --> 51:29.940
than something that uses cock in a bowl

51:29.940 --> 51:31.380
to describe a chicken dish.

51:31.380 --> 51:31.940
That's the thing.

51:31.940 --> 51:33.140
I think that's the point they're getting at.

51:33.140 --> 51:36.340
I would go to a restaurant with only male waiters

51:36.340 --> 51:38.980
and also all those male waiters balls are showing

51:38.980 --> 51:41.860
and the name of the restaurant would be like the ball pit.

51:42.420 --> 51:44.660
And you would go and then they'd be like,

51:44.660 --> 51:45.380
what would you like?

51:45.380 --> 51:51.620
And I would say, could I have like roast beef with au jus?

51:51.620 --> 51:52.580
And they would say, yes.

51:52.580 --> 51:53.380
What would you like?

51:53.380 --> 51:54.580
I would like the prime rib.

51:54.580 --> 51:55.220
Fantastic.

51:55.220 --> 51:56.820
Those are delicious this time of year.

51:57.780 --> 51:59.540
Rather than go to a restaurant where it's like,

52:00.180 --> 52:00.980
what do you want?

52:00.980 --> 52:02.500
The rotten asshole?

52:02.500 --> 52:04.420
Like, whoa, why is it called that?

52:06.340 --> 52:08.740
I'm wearing a tuxedo because I'm your waiter.

52:09.860 --> 52:11.300
Do you want the rotten asshole?

52:12.340 --> 52:12.980
That was weird.

52:12.980 --> 52:13.700
That took a turn.

52:14.260 --> 52:15.220
I don't like that.

52:15.220 --> 52:18.740
No discussion of this sort would be complete

52:18.740 --> 52:20.980
without a visit to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

52:22.740 --> 52:24.980
But I said that and it's not that good

52:25.620 --> 52:26.740
because I just got the menu.

52:26.740 --> 52:29.220
It's not that great.

52:29.860 --> 52:31.460
It's just kind of boring a little bit.

52:32.260 --> 52:37.140
I thought they had like Jimmy Buffett themed snackaroos.

52:37.860 --> 52:39.940
Well, I mean, it's hard because they do have,

52:40.740 --> 52:42.180
there's the booze and a blender,

52:42.180 --> 52:47.540
which is they bring you a who's to blame

52:47.540 --> 52:49.060
or a tropical fruit margarita

52:49.060 --> 52:51.460
in a 22 ounce take home blender cup.

52:51.460 --> 52:52.820
And it is delicious.

52:52.820 --> 52:54.500
So hold up, a blender cup,

52:54.500 --> 52:56.660
by which you mean just the top part of a blender

52:56.660 --> 52:58.180
with the blades and shit in it.

52:58.180 --> 53:00.100
No, so it's a novelty,

53:00.100 --> 53:03.060
but they take it from one blender into another blender.

53:03.780 --> 53:05.220
That seems excessive.

53:05.220 --> 53:06.660
Some other drink.

53:06.660 --> 53:07.540
Okay, so I wasn't looking-

53:07.540 --> 53:09.380
They have really high blender overhead.

53:09.380 --> 53:12.180
I wasn't looking at the drink section

53:12.180 --> 53:13.780
when I said there are awesome names.

53:13.780 --> 53:14.820
If you're a fan of his,

53:14.820 --> 53:16.740
you are going to get a treat here.

53:16.740 --> 53:18.020
Last mango in Paris.

53:18.020 --> 53:19.460
That's a song, but a drink.

53:20.020 --> 53:20.820
Who's to blame?

53:20.820 --> 53:22.500
That's from the song Margaritaville.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.100
Fence to the left, another lyric.

53:24.740 --> 53:25.700
Livin' it up.

53:25.700 --> 53:26.740
That's the name of a drink.

53:26.740 --> 53:27.780
A shaker of salt.

53:27.780 --> 53:28.900
It's just a salt shaker

53:28.900 --> 53:31.060
that you have to eat in front of the waiter.

53:31.060 --> 53:35.220
I think my favorite appetizer at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville

53:35.220 --> 53:36.500
is the clam munchers.

53:36.500 --> 53:36.740
Yeah.

53:37.300 --> 53:37.860
So good.

53:37.860 --> 53:40.980
Uh, there's a five o'clock somewhere drink

53:40.980 --> 53:41.860
that you can order.

53:44.100 --> 53:46.660
Are these part of like a boat drinks umbrella

53:46.660 --> 53:47.220
or is there a thing-

53:47.220 --> 53:48.100
No dipshit.

53:48.100 --> 53:49.860
There's a whole boat drink section.

53:51.140 --> 53:53.540
Bama Breeze, Rum Runner,

53:53.540 --> 53:55.220
Don't Stop the Carnival,

53:55.220 --> 53:56.180
Chocolate Banana-

53:56.180 --> 53:58.500
Don't Stop the Carnival is something

53:58.500 --> 54:00.340
that an alcoholic would say.

54:01.220 --> 54:02.420
I think that all you have to do

54:02.420 --> 54:04.100
is add please in front of it.

54:04.100 --> 54:05.380
Please don't stop the carnival.

54:05.380 --> 54:05.880
Please.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.160
Please.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.760
And of course there's shots too

54:08.760 --> 54:09.880
under the boat drink section.

54:09.880 --> 54:11.560
You can get a boat drink shot

54:11.560 --> 54:14.120
of the Why Don't We Get Drunk in Ellipses

54:15.480 --> 54:17.560
and of course that was a reference to the fact

54:17.560 --> 54:19.160
that when he originally released the single

54:19.160 --> 54:20.200
Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screwed

54:20.200 --> 54:23.320
the record label wouldn't let him put the word screw on there

54:23.320 --> 54:25.160
so there's actually just a picture of a screw

54:25.800 --> 54:26.840
in the in the truck.

54:26.840 --> 54:27.960
That's grosser.

54:29.000 --> 54:29.560
Yeah, way grosser.

54:29.560 --> 54:30.760
Slightly grosser, right?

54:30.760 --> 54:32.840
God, I want to go to this place so bad.

54:32.840 --> 54:33.480
There's no-

54:33.480 --> 54:34.600
I'm living-

54:34.600 --> 54:35.800
I'm 33 years old.

54:35.800 --> 54:36.600
I'm about to be a dad.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.520
I'm living a life without irony.

54:38.520 --> 54:40.920
All I want to go do is go to this place

54:40.920 --> 54:43.880
and drink them all until the names are funny

54:43.880 --> 54:45.080
and then keep drinking.

54:45.080 --> 54:47.400
Listen, you come visit me in Cincinnati.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.800
I will take you to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.640
There is no fucking-

54:52.200 --> 54:54.440
There is no less beachy scene

54:55.000 --> 54:58.200
than eating at the Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville

54:58.200 --> 55:01.480
inside a casino inside a Cincinnati.

55:01.480 --> 55:04.120
There is no less beachy vibe than that.

55:04.120 --> 55:04.600
I'm sorry.

55:04.600 --> 55:06.520
Let me fix that for you, Justin,

55:06.520 --> 55:09.400
because they play all kinds of fun beachy videos

55:09.400 --> 55:10.840
on the closed circuit television.

55:11.560 --> 55:14.760
So do you want to see some busty babes

55:14.760 --> 55:16.200
bouncing at a tailgate?

55:16.200 --> 55:18.840
Some parrot heads in their colorful shirts

55:18.840 --> 55:20.360
enjoying a kegger?

55:20.360 --> 55:21.160
Yeah, you do.

55:21.160 --> 55:22.360
Oh, and what's that?

55:22.360 --> 55:25.080
Oh, it's Jimmy Buffett performing with Lionel Richie.

55:25.080 --> 55:26.200
Oh my god, it's amazing.

55:26.200 --> 55:27.480
It's like you're at the beach.

55:27.480 --> 55:30.040
The only problem with the beachy videos

55:30.040 --> 55:31.000
is like every once in a while

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
the pit bosses wander over to flip it over

55:33.000 --> 55:36.920
to like their closed circuit cams

55:36.920 --> 55:38.200
to watch the tables.

55:38.200 --> 55:38.920
That is correct.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.480
The Jimmy Buffett is also the security office.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.360
It's a lot of fun to work there.

55:44.360 --> 55:46.440
Yeah, it's a blast.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.680
I went to one that was close to our house,

55:49.320 --> 55:51.560
our apartment in Batavia, Ohio,

55:51.560 --> 55:54.360
which was basically inside a mall our apartment was.

55:55.240 --> 55:56.280
We went to that once

55:56.280 --> 55:58.200
and I think I went with dad and Carol

55:59.240 --> 56:02.120
and we sat next to the stage at the Jimmy Buffett,

56:02.120 --> 56:03.720
but there was no live music that night.

56:03.720 --> 56:06.440
They just had a TV hooked up to a PlayStation

56:06.440 --> 56:09.560
and a little boy played Guitar Hero on mute

56:10.120 --> 56:11.800
literally right next to us,

56:11.800 --> 56:13.720
literally in touching distance.

56:13.720 --> 56:14.600
Where was this?

56:14.600 --> 56:17.480
That was at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville,

56:17.480 --> 56:18.920
Batavia, Ohio.

56:18.920 --> 56:21.880
Are you sure that that wasn't a cheeseburger in paradise?

56:21.880 --> 56:24.040
I'm sorry, it was a cheeseburger in paradise.

56:24.040 --> 56:26.680
How does that fucking dude get two restaurants?

56:27.720 --> 56:29.320
He'll be hearing from his lawyers.

56:29.320 --> 56:33.480
Now Jimmy Buffett has to sue himself again.

56:34.120 --> 56:35.640
There's another year's worth of time

56:35.640 --> 56:37.240
where we're not going to get a new album

56:37.240 --> 56:39.400
because Jimmy Buffett has to sue himself.

56:39.400 --> 56:42.280
Thank you all for listening to our program.

56:42.280 --> 56:45.640
We sure appreciate you checking in with us

56:45.640 --> 56:47.640
and spending a little time.

56:48.200 --> 56:51.000
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.160
Chris Gard, The Duke, Iveka Fulnovic,

56:55.160 --> 57:00.520
Nick, Michael, KDC, Shelby, Haley, Nick, Elizabeth,

57:01.480 --> 57:04.840
Rashawn, Diana, so many others.

57:04.840 --> 57:08.040
A lot of really nice comments about our interview

57:08.040 --> 57:09.400
with Elizabeth Gilbert last week.

57:09.400 --> 57:14.680
She was like a blast and we would love to have her back

57:14.680 --> 57:15.560
at some point.

57:15.560 --> 57:18.280
I had a friend here in Austin who said they listened

57:18.280 --> 57:20.280
to that episode because they saw it on Facebook

57:20.280 --> 57:21.480
and didn't think it was true.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.920
They thought we were lying about having Elizabeth Gilbert

57:24.920 --> 57:25.720
on the show.

57:25.720 --> 57:26.520
This is pretty great.

57:28.520 --> 57:30.360
So thank you to everybody tweeting about us.

57:30.360 --> 57:35.560
If you want to share our show with people you love,

57:35.560 --> 57:37.400
just give them nbnbam.com.

57:37.400 --> 57:38.440
We're right there.

57:38.440 --> 57:41.800
And if you could give us a review or a subscription

57:41.800 --> 57:43.960
on iTunes, that would be amazing.

57:43.960 --> 57:44.840
Yeah, that's good.

57:44.840 --> 57:47.320
We also have been putting up some really, really awesome

57:47.320 --> 57:50.280
animated videos on our YouTube that Tyler Crowley made for us.

57:51.080 --> 57:51.720
Go check them out.

57:51.720 --> 57:53.960
It's just nbnbam is the channel name

57:53.960 --> 57:55.000
and they're really, really awesome.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.280
And if you like them, good news.

57:56.920 --> 57:58.680
We're going to try to get some more on there.

57:58.680 --> 58:00.040
And I think you guys are really going to like it.

58:00.040 --> 58:02.040
So go subscribe to our YouTube channel

58:02.040 --> 58:04.680
and tell all your friends about it and share all the videos.

58:04.680 --> 58:07.720
Also, in case you missed it, we announced that we joined up

58:07.720 --> 58:10.200
with this booking agency called Billions.

58:10.200 --> 58:12.120
No big deal, but they are actually a pretty big deal.

58:13.960 --> 58:17.240
They do booking for Welcome to Night Vale,

58:17.240 --> 58:19.080
which is a great show if you're not listening to it,

58:19.720 --> 58:21.160
and a bunch of really great musical acts.

58:21.160 --> 58:24.680
They're going to help us set up some tours next year.

58:26.360 --> 58:32.120
We are going to try and hit a lot of places in America

58:32.120 --> 58:33.560
and maybe a little bit of Canada.

58:33.560 --> 58:35.480
We're still figuring it out, still planning it out.

58:37.320 --> 58:41.160
But yeah, we're going to kick that shit in a high gear

58:41.160 --> 58:41.800
starting next year.

58:41.800 --> 58:44.760
And of course, we'll let you know once stuff firms up.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.400
So hopefully we'll get to see you soon.

58:48.360 --> 58:49.160
That's my hope.

58:49.160 --> 58:50.200
That is my hope as well.

58:50.200 --> 58:52.920
Also, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

58:52.920 --> 58:54.600
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

58:54.600 --> 58:55.960
on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

58:56.760 --> 58:59.560
You can find that record anywhere where records are sold.

59:01.640 --> 59:02.120
Probably.

59:02.680 --> 59:03.800
Yeah, just Google it.

59:03.800 --> 59:05.080
You can get it on the internet.

59:05.080 --> 59:06.920
And I think that's going to do it for us.

59:06.920 --> 59:08.520
Thank you so much, everybody listening.

59:08.520 --> 59:09.240
Thank you.

59:09.240 --> 59:09.640
Thank you.

59:09.640 --> 59:09.960
Thank you.

59:09.960 --> 59:10.600
Thank you.

59:10.600 --> 59:13.000
Please listen to the other Max Fun shows.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.280
There's a ton of really good ones.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.480
Sawbones is a good jumping off point

59:17.480 --> 59:20.440
if you like Justin's dulcet tones.

59:20.440 --> 59:22.600
It's a smooth transition to the other shows.

59:22.600 --> 59:23.080
It's a smooth transition.

59:23.080 --> 59:24.840
There's one of these people I've heard before.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.000
Then there's other really good ones.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.960
Jordan Jesse Go, One Bad Mother, Lady of the Lady,

59:30.520 --> 59:33.880
Wham Bam Pow, Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

59:33.880 --> 59:34.680
There's a ton.

59:34.680 --> 59:37.720
We can't, it would take us 10 minutes to list them all.

59:37.720 --> 59:39.080
But go check it out.

59:39.080 --> 59:39.640
There's a lot.

59:39.640 --> 59:40.120
There's a lot.

59:41.560 --> 59:44.200
This final Yahoo was actually, it was sent in by Drew Davenport,

59:44.200 --> 59:46.280
but he wanted to make sure that I announced that it was actually

59:46.280 --> 59:47.800
his friend Jeff found it.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.960
He did not want to claim, and he's a stand up dude, right?

59:50.760 --> 59:53.800
He's not even going to, he knocks it out of the park every day.

59:53.800 --> 59:55.080
And then when his friend knocks it out of the park,

59:55.080 --> 59:56.520
he doesn't jump on it and claim credit.

59:57.080 --> 59:58.040
Well, he doesn't need it.

59:58.040 --> 59:58.440
Doesn't need it, I guess.

59:58.440 --> 59:59.240
He's got plenty of credit.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.200
So thank you, Jeff.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tammy Yordoz who asks,

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.360
can your butt start higher than the crack?

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.400
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.040
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.440
I'm Griffin McElroy, and my butt starts at the nape of my neck.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.520
My butt starts at the nape of my butt,

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.400
and it gets to dad's straight on the nape of his neck.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:46.920

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.400
Hi, my name's Dave.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.440
And my name's Graham.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.720
Now, what do we have to do to put you in a brand new podcast today?

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.120
Yeah.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.480
What, do you want me to drink bleach?

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:00.600
I'll do it.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.800
Yeah, Dave will drink bleach.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.560
If that's what it takes to get you to listen to,

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.360
stop podcasting yourself on maximumfun.org.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.880
Don't make Dave drink bleach.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.320
Just listen to the show.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.760
He will, but don't make him.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:19.480
Stop podcasting yourself.
