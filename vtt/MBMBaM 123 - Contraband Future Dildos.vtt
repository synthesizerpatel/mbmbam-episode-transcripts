WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.480
It's my brother, my brother and me, and there's a chill in the air.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.880
Really? It's my brother,

00:52.880 --> 00:58.720
my brother and me, and the ruffles have ridges. The ruffles have ridges and there's a chill in

00:58.720 --> 01:04.160
the air. Can you guys feel that? I can feel it. My bones, my bones are so cold, oh my god!

01:04.800 --> 01:11.840
Why can I feel temperature in my bones? Oh, you know what? I bought my wife a blanket at

01:11.840 --> 01:19.760
the gas station. It was $5.99. It looked kind of like a Baja, and I tried to snuggle her up in it,

01:19.760 --> 01:27.200
and she said that it smelled like tires. So I had to, I have to wash it. Of all the places

01:27.200 --> 01:32.720
that make it. Wait, hold on. Did you go to the gas station to buy a blanket?

01:32.720 --> 01:35.680
That's the question. Was it your blanket destination?

01:36.720 --> 01:44.400
Let me hit you with this. Let me give you a bit more context. It was midnight,

01:45.040 --> 01:51.840
and I was there at the gas station to buy beers.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.560
And you thought, my wife is pretty fucking cold right now, I bet.

01:54.560 --> 01:58.720
Honey, I got you some beers and a blanket and this funnel.

01:58.720 --> 02:04.400
She drove and she was, she was sober and good to go. Me, I was buying my 10th and 11th and 12th

02:04.400 --> 02:12.480
beers in the night. And she was, and here's my thought process. I'm walking in to the gas station.

02:13.440 --> 02:18.400
There's a chill in the air. I should see if they have any Navajo style blankets in here.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.360
Oh good, they do. Oh, do they smell like tires? I don't know. My olfactory center is shutting down.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.480
This better cost less than $6. Oh, success. Perfect. Right underneath that line.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.840
So this is an advice show. Can we start recording now or?

02:31.840 --> 02:37.680
Yeah. This is a, time to record. This is an advice show and also blanket recommendations.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.960
I'm your oldest brother, Justin, the blanket man, McElroy.

02:42.960 --> 02:48.000
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis, the Afghan McElroy. Oh no, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna change

02:48.000 --> 02:54.560
it. Good. My name is Griffin McElroy and I'm that quilt that you save just for picnics,

02:54.560 --> 02:58.560
your dirty quilt. You know what I mean? The dirty quilt. Hey NDQ McElroy.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.520
It's a quilt that you use it specifically for outdoor. Maybe there's a music festival.

03:03.520 --> 03:08.160
Maybe you just want to fuck. Maybe you just want to fuck on a soft blanket.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.880
I want to kick off the blanket advice by saying that if you're at the marathon station

03:12.880 --> 03:19.600
on Hauger Boulevard, right off of 64, don't buy a blanket there.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.120
That is enough information to triangulate and kill Justin.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.720
Yeah. Just wait until 11 o'clock on a Friday or Saturday night. If there's a chill in the air,

03:28.720 --> 03:33.920
you see one man wrapped in a blanket, like some sort of discount Mother Teresa,

03:33.920 --> 03:38.480
then that will be me. As opposed to your high price, expensive Mother Teresa.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.960
Yeah. You are going to get triangulated and it's triangulated.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.800
Let's get into the advice. Um, I'm in a relationship that recently passed the one

03:48.800 --> 03:54.240
year mark. Congrats. My girlfriend is lovely and sometimes I'm, I'm sorry,

03:54.240 --> 03:58.400
my girlfriend is lovely and I want nothing but to be with her. However,

03:59.680 --> 04:05.440
I've recently noticed that in my sexy dreams are no longer of random hookups between single adults,

04:05.440 --> 04:11.920
but of cheating on my S.O. It seems my relationship has crept into my very sense of self.

04:11.920 --> 04:18.080
I feel so guilty and fear my occasional sleep talking will give me away.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.640
What can I do? And that is, of course, from thought crime at bedtime.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.040
I do not think the sleep talking works that way. I do not think if you,

04:28.080 --> 04:32.320
I do not think you anybody's ever been like, oh, Deborah, while they're asleep.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.600
Oh, Deborah, your bobbums.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.440
Oh, there was a time that I was having a dream about a book I was reading and leapt

04:37.440 --> 04:41.280
up from bed to scream the main character's name because in my dream they were falling off a cliff.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.640
But other than that, no.

04:44.640 --> 04:50.880
Chas wakes up and just 50 shades of gray. No, I Griffin used to talk in his sleep.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.840
I don't know if he still does, but I remember on car trips, you could have a conversation with

04:53.840 --> 04:58.880
Griffin, but his only responses were in mumbles and he would be like, you say that, but there's

04:58.880 --> 05:04.080
no fuck it. Like, how can you believe anything about me as a kid anymore after the baker under

05:04.080 --> 05:08.560
your bed? That's true. You also, I used to think you slept with one eye open and now I wonder if

05:08.560 --> 05:16.160
you never really slept. Yeah. Wait, what are you saying? Like Little Wonders? Like Little Wonders.

05:16.720 --> 05:21.120
You might be a robot. That's small. That's small wonder. You're thinking of little monsters.

05:21.840 --> 05:27.840
I was thinking of little women. Here's the here's ish. You can't control what you fucking dream.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.960
No, you can't. I had a dream the other night that Teresa and I were fighting zombies and she got

05:32.960 --> 05:37.600
bit and I had to kill her. And like she begged me to do it. She's like, you have to do it. I'm

05:37.600 --> 05:42.320
going to change. And it was horrifying. And I woke up middle of the night, like two 30 and woke her

05:42.320 --> 05:50.080
up to apologize to her. Yeah. And her response was it was a dream. Yeah. That's logical. Makes

05:50.080 --> 05:54.800
a lot of sense. Hey, you guys remember an inception when the guy was like, I'm going to win, I'm going

05:54.800 --> 06:00.720
to win this fight now. And then DiCaprio is like, oh, yeah. What? How about if I dream of this train

06:00.720 --> 06:06.480
and then a train comes in and it kills the guy because Leonardo DiCaprio, like he aimed his dream.

06:06.480 --> 06:11.840
Like first he created he he instantiated the train and his dream world and he aimed it and hit the

06:11.840 --> 06:17.600
guy with it. Right. None of that shit would be true. Like he would say, like, here comes a train,

06:17.600 --> 06:22.160
but instead he would be all of a sudden he's six years old and he's in gym class. Only the gym

06:22.160 --> 06:27.440
classes upside down and they've invented upside down basketball. Here comes a train. It'll be

06:27.440 --> 06:33.440
Quad City DJs. And they would just, they would be singing about even that. Even that I believe is

06:33.440 --> 06:36.960
true. And then you have a dream about cheating on your girlfriend with the Quad City DJs. It would

06:36.960 --> 06:42.480
be the Quad City DJs except they'd be singing like the Smiths or something like that. Honey,

06:42.480 --> 06:47.600
I swear the Quad City DJs and I are just friends. We do in fact have a space jam going on though.

06:47.600 --> 06:54.640
Mm-hmm. But that is not true. See you guys need to get on my tip which is lucid dreaming. Come with

06:54.640 --> 07:01.120
me. Lucid dreaming is where you take control. Yeah. You wrest control of your dreams from Leo

07:01.120 --> 07:06.480
and you say I'm the captain of this ship and you tell yourself tonight I'm gonna dream about

07:06.480 --> 07:11.280
punching Stalin or something. Yeah. Something cool and then you do it and you take control

07:11.280 --> 07:15.600
of your dreams. You just put a little bit of peyote under your tongue before you go to sleep.

07:15.600 --> 07:22.080
If you can, really the best way to do it is to colon roll. And then basically your dreams are,

07:22.080 --> 07:25.680
you are the master of your dreams. Grab the bridle of your dreams and put this paper towel

07:25.680 --> 07:31.600
in your asshole. You have to be spiritually open and ready to control your dreams. And rectally

07:31.600 --> 07:35.920
if you're gonna get that paper towel. If I'm not spiritually and rectally open, I actually,

07:35.920 --> 07:41.920
I'm afraid to fall asleep because I have had control of my dreams for so long that I'm worried

07:41.920 --> 07:46.160
if I go in willy nilly, the dreams are just gonna run rough shot over my emotions. Yeah,

07:46.160 --> 07:52.160
the dream lord will be like finally a weak point. Finally. Now experience all the emojis you've been

07:52.160 --> 07:57.440
holding back. You've been holding onto these emojis in this bottle. I've been saving them.

07:57.440 --> 08:02.880
Experience them all. Have sex with the teeth that fell out of your head because you're naked at

08:02.880 --> 08:07.360
school and you forgot your lines at the play. And you've forgotten how to run quickly and you feel

08:07.360 --> 08:12.480
like you're moving through molasses. And also you're flying off a cliff and you're on fire and

08:12.480 --> 08:16.560
your parents are there and there's your grandma. And you're trying to punch the dude but you can't

08:16.560 --> 08:20.960
remember how to make a fist. You can't remember how to make a fist and your hands are bones and

08:20.960 --> 08:28.240
teeth. I am the dream master, experience your emojis. And the fucked up thing about dreams is

08:28.240 --> 08:31.680
you might be dreaming about- What is, hold on. What is the fucked up thing about dreams? No,

08:31.680 --> 08:36.480
what I'm saying is like you might have a dream that's about like cheating on your SO. Sure.

08:36.480 --> 08:41.280
And in real like, but what it translates to in the synapse of your brain is you were dreaming

08:41.280 --> 08:45.920
about that because you're frustrated with the quality of work you've been doing at work. And

08:45.920 --> 08:52.000
like it has nothing to do with your SO or sex or anything like that. Like your brain has just

08:52.000 --> 08:57.440
translated those impulses to something else. So Travis, because you are, you are obviously so,

08:57.440 --> 09:04.000
so good at this. If I do have a dream with upside down basketball and I'm getting gangbanged by the

09:04.000 --> 09:10.160
Quad City DJs, how many of them are there? Quad City DJs? I assume there's four. Four from

09:10.160 --> 09:12.880
different cities. And they each represent the different districts of that. Okay. Oh,

09:12.880 --> 09:19.200
that makes sense. Four DJs inside. Then like, what's the- You're four DJs deep. I'm four DJs.

09:19.200 --> 09:25.440
Well, they're, they're each one quarter Griffin deep. Anyway, what's the, what's the implication?

09:26.880 --> 09:33.840
I think it means that there's big possibilities on the horizon. Okay. Okay. So you're using

09:33.840 --> 09:40.880
them for fortune telling. Yeah. For omens and portents. Yeah. So you're saying that

09:41.600 --> 09:47.920
dreaming of the Quad City DJs in a sexual fashion is a good, is a good omen. It usually means that

09:47.920 --> 09:52.960
there's going to be a solid harvest. Yeah. I know there's going to be a solid harvest.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.280
It's me and the Quad City DJs. You're going to like what you're reaping. Your barn will not be

09:57.280 --> 10:01.680
overflowing with grain, but it will sustain you through the cold, cold winter. They are going to

10:01.680 --> 10:06.000
be at, something's going to overflow. It's the Quad City DJs and me. Let the crystal pour.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.040
Um. So long story short, your dreams don't mean shit. You don't have to worry about it. Dreams

10:11.040 --> 10:15.440
don't mean anything. And you're not gonna, and if you, if she gets mad at you because of something

10:15.440 --> 10:19.360
crazy you dream, that's a crazy thing to get mad about. Yeah. I don't think he's telling,

10:19.360 --> 10:25.280
I do not think he's telling her. I think that his ish is that he feels guilty for his brain,

10:25.280 --> 10:30.880
brain crimes that he's doing. Yeah. I don't think you have to feel guilty about that. Yeah. You

10:30.880 --> 10:38.720
can't feel guilty. Your brain all day, every day, you spend controlling the literally thousands of

10:38.720 --> 10:46.880
life ruining impulses. Yes. And you are, do such a good job of that. At evening times,

10:46.880 --> 10:52.240
when you're asleep, just your, your brain has got to run wild like Hulkamania, brother.

10:52.240 --> 10:56.320
It's got to get out there. It's got to do all the bad things that you didn't let it do,

10:56.320 --> 11:00.560
but it'll do for pretend. It's a deal. Your brain is writing awesome movies starring you.

11:00.560 --> 11:06.960
You don't censor them. You're saying, you're saying full, like lean into it, like full blown,

11:06.960 --> 11:15.200
dip your balls into the Caligula Caligula, like wieners, wieners, ahoy everywhere.

11:15.200 --> 11:21.040
Plaster the wall with them. Wait, why do you assume, whoa, why do you assume that everyone's

11:21.040 --> 11:26.960
dreams are just full of wieners? Cause you can't imagine what a vagina looks like unconsciously.

11:26.960 --> 11:31.280
Fair enough. Look at it this way. Like if you had a dream where you killed someone,

11:31.280 --> 11:35.760
you wouldn't wake up the next day and be like, I got to turn myself in. Like I have

11:35.760 --> 11:40.400
homicidal tendencies. I want to kill everyone. Like that's not how it works. So it doesn't

11:40.400 --> 11:46.480
translate the other way. I'm not saying you should try to make your dream sexier. I'm not saying like

11:46.480 --> 11:51.600
you should just like, you should like go to bed reading Tropic of Cancer to try to ramp up the

11:51.600 --> 11:57.680
nastiness. Yeah. I'm saying, I'm saying that just like, let it, let it be, you know, don't

11:57.680 --> 12:06.160
just let the stink build in there. Just let it get real, real ripe. Um, you guys want a Yahoo answer?

12:06.160 --> 12:10.320
Yeah. You guys have totems, right? You got a little, like I've got a little,

12:11.200 --> 12:14.480
it'll get a little thing and you hold it and then your dream, you know, if it's a dream or

12:14.480 --> 12:19.680
if you're being incepted. Yeah, it's my wiener. Yeah, of course. Okay. Mine's my wiener too.

12:19.680 --> 12:27.360
Cause nobody knows the heft. This Yahoo answer was sent. The weird sharp edges are. Why is it sharp?

12:29.680 --> 12:34.240
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Supindle. Thanks Supindle. It's by Yahoo answer user

12:34.240 --> 12:39.520
Rayo who asks, what do you think of Dan Aykroyd physically?

12:39.520 --> 12:48.400
What do you think of Dan Aykroyd's aspect years ago and at present? Thanks.

12:51.680 --> 12:58.800
All right. As weird as this question is, I know what this person is asking. Yeah. It's unrecognizable.

12:58.800 --> 13:06.320
The shift. But, but, but the same shift has befallen

13:06.320 --> 13:12.000
two of the Ghostbusters. I see what you're saying. Because Dan Aykroyd has gone through this. Harold

13:12.000 --> 13:18.640
Ramis may as well be a different person. I mean, totally different dude. You would not connect that

13:18.640 --> 13:23.200
guy. I would need him to show me his driver's license before I would believe that that is

13:23.200 --> 13:27.520
Harold Ramis of Ghostbusters. Right. That's why I would say like Bill Murray has aged poorly,

13:27.520 --> 13:31.280
but on a constant. No, no, no, no. Bill Murray, you look at Bill Murray, you look at a picture

13:31.280 --> 13:35.680
of old Bill Murray and young Bill Murray and you say, okay, I can see how those two are connected.

13:35.680 --> 13:40.400
That's what I'm saying. It's been on a constant curve, but not like for the better. Right. You

13:40.400 --> 13:43.760
look at a young picture of Dan Aykroyd and it looks like Dan Aykroyd and you look at a picture

13:43.760 --> 13:47.600
of Dan Aykroyd nowadays and it looks like Baron fucking Harkonnen. Like he'd look up.

13:49.280 --> 13:55.600
It's, it's upsetting visually. Ernie Hudson, worth pointing out, looks great. Ernie Hudson looks

13:55.600 --> 14:00.560
great. It's, you know why? He's young at heart and at brain. Dude fucking loves Pokemon cards. Well,

14:00.560 --> 14:05.440
he's also my favorite Ghostbuster. The nice thing about Ernie Hudson is that he's managed

14:05.440 --> 14:11.840
to take it easy since he hasn't worked himself too hard since Ghostbusters. Every so often he

14:11.840 --> 14:18.160
does an episode of Psych and then he just kicks back, you know? He, I mean, he's still, he's got,

14:18.160 --> 14:22.720
he's got his Beverly Hills Chihuahua residues, which is I'm sure treating him real nice.

14:24.320 --> 14:31.280
I just looked up, I looked up Ernie Hudson just now to make sure that I was right about him looking

14:31.280 --> 14:37.680
great. And he does look great for a 66 year old man. He looks wonderful. But I saw a picture of

14:37.680 --> 14:43.600
his hand prints in cement. I was like, whoa, Ernie Hudson, you're a lot better than I thought. And

14:43.600 --> 14:47.600
then I read the caption that says the hand prints of Hudson in front of the great movie ride at

14:47.600 --> 14:52.240
Walt Disney World's Disney World Hollywood Studios theme park. Better than nothing. Better than

14:52.240 --> 14:56.560
nothing. I don't have my, my prints aren't there. Yeah. It could have just been like he was going

14:56.560 --> 15:00.160
outside to get the paper. He slipped, fell, they were filling in a pothole, burned his hands real

15:00.160 --> 15:06.640
good. Did you guys see him in Franklin and Bash this year? No. I've never seen Franklin and Bash

15:06.640 --> 15:12.320
to begin with. I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually exist. Is that a men's catalog? It's a Mark Paul

15:12.320 --> 15:18.880
Gosler. Oh, I've heard of that. Yeah. It's on, it's in its third season. I don't know. I mean,

15:18.880 --> 15:23.520
it's Breckenmeyer and Mark Paul Gosler, two of Travis's favorite, favorite people. I do not

15:23.520 --> 15:28.720
believe that he is not watching the show. It's actually, they've canceled each other out and

15:28.720 --> 15:32.640
that is so charming that it's just engulfed into a charming black hole and I can't watch it.

15:32.640 --> 15:37.440
I understand. It kind of looks like his head is getting taller. Like his head never stopped

15:37.440 --> 15:43.280
growing. Right. He is, he is actually becoming a cone head, ironically enough. Yikes. Yowzers.

15:43.280 --> 15:47.360
Why are we? No, but now, okay, listen. Can we take a step back and figure out why we're making fun

15:47.360 --> 15:50.560
of Dan Aykroyd as far as we are? That's what I was gonna say. To be fair, like it's never like in

15:50.560 --> 15:54.880
the past when he was 25 that he was some dreamboat that everybody pined after. Oh, I'm gonna fuck

15:54.880 --> 15:59.200
that. I think the interesting thing about Dan Aykroyd, other than the fact that he's obviously

15:59.200 --> 16:06.720
a genius, is that Dan Aykroyd has made a career out of being a caricature of a person that it

16:06.720 --> 16:12.080
turns out he is. Yes. Like, you know what I mean? I think the weird thing about Dan Aykroyd is

16:12.080 --> 16:18.640
you think that he is mocking this like, like slyly skewering a certain type of person with

16:18.640 --> 16:25.680
his whole spiel, and it turns out he just is, he snuck into Hollywood somehow, and he is in fact

16:25.680 --> 16:30.240
that person. Yes. But I also, here's the other weird aspect that now as I'm going through my

16:30.240 --> 16:35.440
head of all the Dan Aykroyd movies I can think of, it's like you could watch him become less and less

16:35.440 --> 16:41.280
attractive, but he plateaued at this point where he was perfectly unattractive to play like a

16:41.280 --> 16:45.120
hundred different roles. Like, instead of growing more and more attractive, something like, oh my

16:45.120 --> 16:49.040
God, you're beautiful. You're perfect for this. Like, they were like, yeah, you'll look great as

16:49.040 --> 16:53.840
a conehead. You'll look great as this dude. And then he kind of slipped over the edge of the

16:53.840 --> 17:01.120
plateau and kept going down. You're saying there was a point in his physical life when Dan Aykroyd

17:01.120 --> 17:06.560
was the perfect amount of unattractive and attractive to where he would be perfectly

17:06.560 --> 17:12.640
believable in literally any role. He became the Lon Chaney of comedic actors for a brief,

17:12.640 --> 17:18.400
for a brief moment in time, right around, I'm going to, I'm going to pin it actually

17:18.400 --> 17:27.280
as, as right around, uh, I would say Casper. I think, okay. See, I'm going to put it in 1988

17:27.280 --> 17:32.720
with my stepmother is an alien. There was a day, there was a six month period in his life

17:32.720 --> 17:38.000
when Dan Aykroyd could be believably married to Kim Basinger. Did he sign on to that movie

17:38.000 --> 17:44.240
because he thought it was like a hard hitting documentary. Finally, finally we're unearthing

17:45.360 --> 17:51.280
these schemes and scandals. But I like, I picture him in gross point blank and he was

17:51.280 --> 18:01.280
perfectly unattractive in that, but not so much so that I was like, oh, see, I think,

18:01.280 --> 18:06.400
I think Dan Aykroyd looks great. He's looking better. I think for me, there's a picture of him

18:06.400 --> 18:13.360
from three where he's looking dynamite. Let me see up on his IMDb. We're just, we're just combing

18:13.360 --> 18:19.520
through the, we're combing through the Dan Aykroyd pictures. I mean, no shit though. You guys,

18:20.240 --> 18:24.400
Griffin might be right. And then I'm looking at a series of pictures as he's aged. His forehead

18:24.400 --> 18:29.920
has literally gotten taller and taller. His hairline is not receding. His hairline is,

18:29.920 --> 18:36.480
his eyebrows are just descending. It's like, it's like he's been put in a machine that's

18:36.480 --> 18:42.000
filling his brain with thoughts. And it's just like making his head swell. Yeah. It's like,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.840
he's got that, he doesn't have a forehead anymore. He's got that Tyra Banks five head.

18:47.760 --> 18:52.480
Anyway, we're all big fans of your work, Mr. Aykroyd. And we do want to say thank you again

18:52.480 --> 18:57.520
for, for listening to this show. I love your, I love your vodka. I love your, what if you pulled

18:57.520 --> 19:01.440
like an Anthony Michael Hall and just like rolled up in a movie next year, just totally fit and

19:01.440 --> 19:05.840
looking so good. And I was like, who the fuck is that? And like, Dan Aykroyd. I don't know who

19:05.840 --> 19:11.200
that is, but I want to fuck him. Oh man. Maybe he'll be in a good day to die hard. But like,

19:11.200 --> 19:18.800
as Bruce Willis's hunkier. Younger brother. Younger brother. Younger brother. This is my brother,

19:18.800 --> 19:26.080
Stan McClain. This is my brother, Don McClain. He may look like the actor Dan Aykroyd, but that's

19:26.080 --> 19:30.960
impossible. Look how fucking fit he is. Not to be confused with that other Don McClain fool.

19:31.840 --> 19:38.640
I would love it if at the end of the movie, Bruce Willis just like takes off, takes off a prosthetic

19:38.640 --> 19:44.080
nose and you look at it and it was, it was, it was Dan Aykroyd the whole time. You didn't even know.

19:44.880 --> 19:52.400
And Dan Aykroyd like pulls out a, a shotgun and gives his signature line. Get along little doggies.

19:52.400 --> 19:58.240
Get along, get along you jerkos. And then he fires at him.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.480
I love that. Love that series. Love that franchise.

20:03.200 --> 20:08.880
Sure. And it's only getting better. I work in a small rural high school and I have a problem.

20:08.880 --> 20:15.200
The principal of my school does not know how to let go of a handshake. He will stand next to you

20:15.200 --> 20:19.360
and hold a conversation with you. And without fail, never let go of your hand until the

20:19.360 --> 20:24.240
conversation is over. Whether the conversation lasts 10 minutes or 10 seconds or three minutes,

20:24.240 --> 20:28.560
he will not let go unless you pull out with the anxiety and fear of an anxious teen.

20:29.120 --> 20:33.280
How do I extricate myself from these sticky situations without being too awkward?

20:33.280 --> 20:39.680
That's from shaking in a small. Wait, his hand is sticky? Gross. That's an issue. This is an ish

20:39.680 --> 20:46.480
of the highest degree. This is a serious situation. There, I have never felt, let me think, let me

20:46.480 --> 20:54.640
think of. I think maybe. Really, just my girlfriend is the only hand that I've ever touched that I

20:54.640 --> 21:00.480
wasn't immediately like, I don't like the way that that feels. You know what I mean? It's not like

21:01.040 --> 21:07.920
there's always a humor on the on the human hand that I do not. I do not appreciate being in contact

21:07.920 --> 21:12.080
with. I have for the longest time. It's a really weird hangout. But if you had the stickiest,

21:12.080 --> 21:16.480
creepiest hands. No, but if I shake hands with someone or someone like touches my shoulder or

21:16.480 --> 21:21.600
something, the first thought that pops in my head is their hand probably smells weird. I don't know

21:21.600 --> 21:25.360
why, but like that always is like my first thought. I hate. Can I tell you something,

21:25.360 --> 21:34.400
Trav? Can I real talk you? Yeah. Your hand has a faintly sweet smell to it that you put that I

21:34.400 --> 21:42.320
don't want to cast aspersions, but everything you touch assumes that that scent. So maybe you may be

21:42.320 --> 21:47.520
right in that assumption because you're passing it on to them. I think I smell wonderful. Okay,

21:47.520 --> 21:55.040
yeah. I think I smell faintly of honeysuckles. You smell like you do. You smell a little bit like

21:55.040 --> 21:59.760
honey and that's why. And that, but that's not good because your hand is gigantic. You don't

21:59.760 --> 22:05.040
think you don't think there's a worse smell than honey. You don't think. No, you smell a little

22:05.040 --> 22:09.680
bit like honey. That's just enough to be disconcerting, right? I'll work on it, right? It

22:09.680 --> 22:16.640
sounds like fully like it sounds like a honey ham is a better way of saying it. When you shake hands

22:16.640 --> 22:20.560
with Travis, it's like a honeyed ham. Now that is not true. I have a wonderful handshake that I've

22:20.560 --> 22:26.400
been complimented on many times. It's because the people are you inspire fear in their hearts

22:26.400 --> 22:30.000
because you have a very well, you know, Machiavelli said you can either be feared or loved, but not

22:30.000 --> 22:37.200
both. And I chose to go with fear in my handshake. But then I love in the deep pools of my eyes.

22:38.320 --> 22:42.080
When someone shakes your hand trap, they, they pull their hand back and they go, what the fuck

22:42.080 --> 22:46.480
was that? And then they smell their hand and they go, what the fuck was that? I can't even imagine

22:46.480 --> 22:49.760
why people have commented on the fact that they feel like the last couple of episodes have been

22:49.760 --> 22:56.240
very anti Travis. If you're listening, it's not a bad Travis chase your bliss. It's not a bad

22:56.240 --> 23:01.120
thing that my hand smells like honey or making it seem like it is. Is it possible that you can

23:01.120 --> 23:07.680
convert the handshake to a hug? Oh, like a bro hug, like, like double tap on the back. Yeah. Like

23:07.680 --> 23:14.720
a bringing in big, like a bump, maybe even not wrap the free arm around, but even like bringing

23:14.720 --> 23:22.160
in and then pull out to show like, Hey, I'm done with this. Like I'm out of this. This is a really

23:22.160 --> 23:27.440
odd cultural thing that would make me sincerely. I would, if somebody tried to hold onto me,

23:28.160 --> 23:33.440
I would probably lose my mind with like being trapped in a social situation.

23:35.200 --> 23:38.240
When is, when is a handshake appropriate? Like first greeting?

23:39.680 --> 23:43.520
Never. No, but I mean, in the world, you can't say that. Cause like in a meeting, when like,

23:43.520 --> 23:48.400
if you work in a business and someone goes, Oh, and this is such and such, like you don't just

23:48.400 --> 23:54.080
like nod your head. It's a professional hug. Yes. Yeah. I feel like the hug is the, is the

23:54.080 --> 23:57.920
gold standard of these, of these types of things. So I think the weird thing here is not the,

23:57.920 --> 24:02.960
but it's not the timeframe for which he'll hold the handshake. It's that every time he sees you,

24:02.960 --> 24:09.840
he shakes your hand. I really shake hands with people the first time we meet. And then the,

24:09.840 --> 24:16.320
when we agreed to kill one another's relatives and we want to seal the deal. Those are the only times

24:16.320 --> 24:21.360
and so we'll never be caught. Those are the only times when I feel like a handshake is appropriate.

24:21.360 --> 24:25.760
Other than that, I don't want to hear about it. If you're, if you hold on past three pumps,

24:26.800 --> 24:31.760
if you go to four pumps, you're officially holding hands at the very worst. You should

24:31.760 --> 24:39.520
just slow your pumps, you know, in Somalia, you're married now. Now, when you say slow your pumps,

24:40.720 --> 24:45.200
are you talking about doing like a very slow, like snake dance move? Or maybe you could go

24:45.200 --> 24:49.520
to a side to side pump. Everyone does up and down pump, go side to side pump. And I guarantee three

24:49.520 --> 24:54.720
times with that, he'll never shake your hand again. If I fucking ever met anybody businessly

24:55.440 --> 24:59.280
and I grabbed their hand to go for the shake, but instead of doing the shake, I did the snake with

24:59.280 --> 25:05.040
my arms and I started with my free arm and worked it over and he completed it to completion on his

25:05.040 --> 25:10.720
other free arm. I would, I would sign any fucking contract that person put before me. Cause we are

25:10.720 --> 25:16.480
then best friends. Yeah. That's the coolest move. That's a great move. There's no better way to

25:16.480 --> 25:19.920
figure out like, do you know how when sometimes you think a person's lame or you just don't think

25:19.920 --> 25:23.440
anything of them at all. And then you learn that they'd like say something like maybe they like a

25:23.440 --> 25:26.240
band that you like, you're like, oh, you're actually pretty fucking cool. This is a,

25:26.240 --> 25:32.880
this is a litmus test for doing that shit at first blush. Like, it's like the test from the thing

25:32.880 --> 25:38.000
where you dip the hot wire in the blood. It's a, it's a quickest, fastest way to coolness. Travis,

25:38.000 --> 25:42.080
when you say that someone should slow their pumps, you think that that's something you should try to

25:42.080 --> 25:47.520
do with your own actions? Or are you literally suggesting a situation where you look this person

25:47.520 --> 25:53.840
dead in the eye and say, Hey, hey, hey, slow those pumps down. What is the rush? Are you feeling

25:53.840 --> 26:01.120
this electricity between us? This is something real we have here. Why are you rushing these pumps?

26:01.120 --> 26:06.080
I bet you Matthew McConaughey would be in twice as many movies if he didn't do that every single

26:06.080 --> 26:09.840
time in that four song person. If he didn't start with clutching the fingers and then work his way

26:09.840 --> 26:16.800
into the palms. Hey, hey, hey, little nephew, why are we rushing pumps? Whoa, whoa, whoa,

26:16.800 --> 26:22.640
Stevie Speils, let's slow it on down. I want to be in, I want to be your new Indiana Jones.

26:26.400 --> 26:33.920
Who's having a stroke? The most, the most white beatenest man to ever live. Matthew McConaughey

26:33.920 --> 26:42.640
and Bing Crosby's son, Matthew Crosby. Bing McConaughey, please. Please call me Bing.

26:42.640 --> 26:50.480
My father was Mr. McConaughey. Someday at the end times, Matthew Crosby will have to take up arms

26:50.480 --> 26:57.440
against Bing McConaughey. Once brothers, now bitter sworn enemies. Oh my Christ.

26:57.440 --> 27:07.280
That was my Bing Crosby impression. We got to do this money zone. We got to do,

27:07.280 --> 27:09.600
we got to. I don't think we helped that gentleman at all.

27:11.200 --> 27:15.040
Here's what you do, fucking slap their hand with your other hand. That's why you don't handshake

27:15.040 --> 27:19.040
with two hands. So you have the other hand to fight off an attacker. And that's what this

27:19.040 --> 27:24.160
person's doing to you. Yeah, they are pinning you. Would you lose your job if once after he

27:24.160 --> 27:28.400
was done talking, he went to break, you didn't break and you're like, we can think of more stuff

27:28.400 --> 27:32.160
to talk about. That's good. That's good. Or maybe every time he touches your hand,

27:32.160 --> 27:38.240
yell bad touch. Just like that. No, no, no, no, no dress it. Yeah. I mean, I need an adult.

27:38.240 --> 27:55.680
Okay. Seriously. I want money. Okay. Who's this message for Griffin? I have no idea. Brad. Who's

27:55.680 --> 28:04.160
this message from Travis? It's Amber. And Brad says to Amber, happy birthday love. I can't imagine

28:04.160 --> 28:11.200
my life without noodle in the loaf and all this. Oh my God. It's noodle and the loaf, not noodling

28:11.200 --> 28:16.000
the loaf. I just want to make that clear to everyone. They are both equally unpleasant on

28:16.000 --> 28:21.280
a different spectrum of unpleasantness. How do you even do this? I just, so I'm clear. This is

28:21.280 --> 28:28.080
Amber speaking to Brad and she loves noodle in the loaf. We were noodling the loaf. Oh yeah.

28:28.080 --> 28:35.280
That was great. You're my Ron, my people, my bramble pelt. And she says the Brad is the best

28:35.280 --> 28:42.080
writer slash musician slash singer she's ever known. His actual birthday is today. Oh shit.

28:42.080 --> 28:47.520
Double. So double message. Go noodle his loaf and just wait, wait. Why is this a double message

28:47.520 --> 28:54.800
Griffin? Cause it's his birthday on his birthday. Yeah. Also I don't think let's not get weird,

28:54.800 --> 29:01.520
but I don't think he's the one that has the loaf. I can't actually think about the physics of

29:01.520 --> 29:06.000
noodling the loaf. I know I wished it into existence and now I'm trying to wish it away.

29:06.880 --> 29:12.000
So I'm going to move on to this message for Amy Endsworth and Brian. Be safe. If you're going to

29:12.000 --> 29:16.240
noodle the loaf, please be safe. Make sure the loaf has cooled down. Don't take it right out

29:16.240 --> 29:24.240
the oven. There's burns. Don't take your butt loaf right out of the sex oven. If you know what I

29:24.240 --> 29:32.320
mean. And I think you know what I mean. I think you do. There's burns Amber. Be careful. Be smart.

29:33.360 --> 29:39.840
Stay in school. Amy Endsworth. There's a message from Benjamin Endsworth, your husband. He says,

29:39.840 --> 29:45.120
you make my life better in every way. You bring such joy into our world. I love you so much for

29:45.120 --> 29:50.560
everything you do in our, you are my heaven and earth, my moon and my stars. And I love you. Thank

29:50.560 --> 29:55.920
you for loving me. And by the way, can we try noodling the loaf? I read about it.

29:58.560 --> 30:03.040
Well, see, I actually said it's insulation love sauce, which is what I see in what you

30:03.040 --> 30:08.800
pour over noodle in the loaf. Yeah, we had this delicious noodle in the loaf. It was

30:08.800 --> 30:12.640
smothered in love sauce. It was delish. That was, that was really sweet.

30:12.640 --> 30:19.600
Please put, save funnier stuff next time for us. Next time, please do a little work for us.

30:19.600 --> 30:25.280
I, I, I appreciate your love and it brings, it brings joy to my heart and my life. But if you

30:25.280 --> 30:29.600
could say something in there, like a pop culture reference or something that we could make sound

30:29.600 --> 30:36.000
like a penis and a vagina. That'd be awesome. Hey, doesn't it feel like it's time for Nicholas

30:36.000 --> 30:44.480
Hyde's birthday? Yeah, it seems like just this time last year. Yeah. And then the year before

30:44.480 --> 30:51.840
that, that he turned 91. Today we're celebrating the 92nd birthday of Nicholas Hyde from his pal,

30:51.840 --> 30:58.240
John. He, Nick's a 3L law student. Apparently it's taken him a while to get through. He's a

30:58.240 --> 31:07.840
apparently not. Why are you putting him on blast like that? Because he's 92 years old. He's a big

31:07.840 --> 31:15.040
old dumb-o. Yeah. And it says he's starting a career in standup comedy. Nicholas, your birthday

31:15.040 --> 31:20.080
present from us is that we're going to force you to choose a career path right this second. Go. You

31:20.080 --> 31:26.080
can either be a lawyer, a standup comic or a video game master. Daris, those are the three things that

31:26.080 --> 31:30.480
there are to be. Please choose one and move on with your life. One of those jobs pays real well

31:31.120 --> 31:37.760
and then one of them's not really a job at all. I would choose lawyer. You'll get like a paycheck

31:37.760 --> 31:44.880
and whatnot. That sounds pretty good. But video game master, the reward is inherent. And the robe

31:44.880 --> 31:52.080
you get is beautiful. Yeah, it's all shimmery and yeah, I love that. The best thing about being a

31:52.080 --> 31:58.960
lawyer is you earn a bunch of money and you know what the best thing to spend your money on? Ass

31:59.600 --> 32:06.080
products. I was actually going to say a box that shocks your dick, but that's pretty good. You

32:06.080 --> 32:14.800
guessed a good thing. I'm going to give you guys, I'm going to talk about ExtremeExchange.com. That

32:14.800 --> 32:21.520
is your super store for adult toys. Adults only please. I'm going to get, we're going to do a

32:21.520 --> 32:27.520
little quiz, a little quick two to three question quiz depending on how long your answers take.

32:27.520 --> 32:32.640
I'm going to give you guys a name of a product and I want you to guess each guess with no hesitation

32:34.160 --> 32:41.040
what you think it is. Who's starting? Travis will answer first thing. First product is nipple

32:41.040 --> 32:45.520
boosters. I think it pulls your nipples out. I think it's like a jet pack, but you wear it on

32:45.520 --> 32:52.880
the front and it's powered by nipple energy. Okay. That is Travis. Travis wins their suction cups

32:52.880 --> 32:56.480
that you put on your nipples to heighten them. Okay. Okay. We're going to- I'm sick of my,

32:56.480 --> 33:03.040
my nipples are like two inches below sea level. I hate them. My nipples are so lackadaisical.

33:03.680 --> 33:13.280
Perk up boys. Pumping buddy tea hose connector. No. You know sometimes you're trying to steep

33:13.280 --> 33:19.200
your tea and you're steeping your tea in there, but, and then- And you get lonely and you need

33:19.200 --> 33:23.920
a pumping buddy to be there with you. You think like, I want to get that tea, but I want it to

33:23.920 --> 33:29.200
go up instead of down. And so this is a special tube. And if you've ever heard of a butt chug?

33:30.320 --> 33:36.800
Sure. This does it. This does it, but it's specifically with steeped tea. Okay. Travis,

33:36.800 --> 33:43.760
what do you think it is? Let me give you a hint. Guess something with dicks. I think that you put

33:43.760 --> 33:49.120
three dicks in and you form a tea and it pumps them. No. Well, it is that tube you connect,

33:49.120 --> 33:55.120
you use to connect two dicks or a dick and a clitoris or whatever. Like a Chinese finger trap.

33:56.160 --> 34:02.240
Exactly. Justin, on the subject of guess something with dicks, have you ever considered

34:02.240 --> 34:13.360
turning this podcast into like a PSAT prep podcast? This podcast is two dicks. Do we have any sort of

34:13.360 --> 34:21.520
measurable numbers for if this podcast does make you better at the PSAT? Yes, except the inverse

34:21.520 --> 34:25.600
of that. I can't, it couldn't possibly make it worse. Nah, it couldn't make it worse. But anyway,

34:25.600 --> 34:32.880
extremistraints.com is your home for awesome, awesome toys that you never knew existed. You guys

34:32.880 --> 34:38.480
are buying stuff like, we like to go to the outer edges mostly just because we've talked about

34:38.480 --> 34:44.160
Extremistraints so many times that I can't even get a semi talking about like dildos and stuff.

34:44.160 --> 34:48.640
Yeah, that's old hat, man. That's old hat. That seems pedestrian. Are you saying that there once

34:48.640 --> 34:54.400
was a time where you could say the word dildo and just like that? There's no full mask. No,

34:54.400 --> 35:00.400
no, I'm not right. No. Extremistraints.com, use the coupon code MIDDLIST and we're going to save

35:00.400 --> 35:04.320
you 20%. Well, we're not going to save you. The fine people of Extremistraints.com are going to

35:04.320 --> 35:08.960
save you 20%. You guys are using that one and that coupon code quite a bit. And I would suggest you

35:08.960 --> 35:14.400
continue to use it. And all your stuff will come in a very discreet box. None of those big bright

35:14.400 --> 35:21.680
red, this box full of dildos boxes you normally get. You'll be lucky if you can find it. They will

35:21.680 --> 35:26.720
make it look like the rock you hide your key under. Wait a minute. I could have sworn I ordered

35:26.720 --> 35:30.800
something from them. Have you guys seen Looper? What they do is they travel back in time and they

35:30.800 --> 35:35.920
give you that dildo 20 minutes before you ordered it. So you've actually always had that dildo.

35:36.960 --> 35:42.480
Only you go, wait a second. But then you go 30 years and it's your dildo. It was your dildo.

35:42.480 --> 35:52.000
They closed the loop. I closed my dildo loop. Now close your loop. And by loop,

35:52.000 --> 35:55.520
I mean, butthole. Close it up with this thing. At Extremistraints.com.

35:56.720 --> 36:03.520
Close your loop. You're orgasming wrong. I'm Dan Ackroyd, the brother of old Joseph

36:03.520 --> 36:08.960
Ford Levitt. And I'm going to close your dildo loop. He grew up into me. He grew up into me in

36:08.960 --> 36:12.640
an alternate future where someone gave him a dildo. Can you believe it? No, neither can I.

36:13.760 --> 36:20.640
Me neither. In the future, dildos are illegal. So we have to put them in this machine and send

36:20.640 --> 36:24.800
them back to you and you can save money on them and you got to get rid of them. By which I mean,

36:24.800 --> 36:28.960
put them all the way up your butt until you can't see it anymore. That way future cops can't find

36:28.960 --> 36:35.520
it. Griffin, are you suggesting that the reason Dan Ackroyd's head is increasing in size is because

36:35.520 --> 36:40.880
people are using his head to store contraband future dildos? Is that what you're saying to

36:40.880 --> 36:47.200
me right now? And as I assume all of you want a my brother, my brother and me shout out, just go to

36:47.200 --> 36:57.120
maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron. And you too could join the podcast. I can't believe that

36:57.120 --> 37:02.800
I use the same air in this room to wish those people that said that the stars were each other's

37:02.800 --> 37:08.080
love or something to also say that Dan Ackroyd's head is full of illegal future dildos.

37:12.400 --> 37:17.680
My husband Brett and I do a fantasy football league with a couple of friends and I have a

37:17.680 --> 37:26.160
dilemma. I would like to flaunt my wins, especially over my husband, as I am the only

37:26.800 --> 37:32.320
girl participating. However, I do not want to be mean and upset anyone. How do I celebrate

37:32.320 --> 37:38.720
my victories without seeming like I'm throwing it in their faces? That's from Bama Girl. I think

37:38.720 --> 37:46.160
it's Bama Girl. It could be Bama Girl. I will say this is a hard one for me to answer. Currently,

37:47.200 --> 37:53.840
touchdown to an Abbey is a zero and four. So I think at this point, if I had a win, I would

37:53.840 --> 38:01.440
pretty much set my house on fire. In celebration? In celebration. Thrilled celebration. As the Mario

38:01.440 --> 38:07.840
Lopez dispenser, the GM of the Mario Lopez dispenser, who is currently sitting on a pretty

38:07.840 --> 38:16.800
three-in-one, I think you can't worry too much about it. But can I make a suggestion to our

38:16.800 --> 38:22.320
listeners, since that is what we are supposed to be doing? I think taking it from the angle of

38:22.320 --> 38:26.320
I'm the only girl and I'm beating you and I'm a girl winning, I think you're just going to

38:26.320 --> 38:31.520
alienate yourself and I don't think that that's a good way to go. And you set all of woman combat,

38:31.520 --> 38:35.760
just celebrate on the angle that you are winning and they are not. You could send a message.

38:35.760 --> 38:40.800
You could send a message saying, saying like, I'm a woman and this is, so that's normal,

38:41.360 --> 38:46.160
and I beat you any, I beat you normal like a normal person would. Is that good? This is a

38:46.160 --> 38:50.400
neutral victory that I'm having. Neutral victory? Jenner has no play in this whatsoever. My points

38:50.400 --> 38:56.560
were higher than yours and that's really all it came down to. But like, let's be honest here. We

38:56.560 --> 39:02.960
are talking about game in which you win by picking which other person is actually going to do a real

39:02.960 --> 39:10.480
good job in the real world. Yeah, like bragging is all you have. Like it is a game composed entirely

39:10.480 --> 39:16.160
of just shaming people for your good luck. Like that's it. Yeah. At least I hope that's it because

39:16.160 --> 39:20.480
I'm zero and four. If it's not chance, then I feel brave. Do you want to know my fantasy football

39:20.480 --> 39:27.760
secret? And this is not a joke. I follow on Twitter everyone on my team. Okay. And sometimes

39:27.760 --> 39:31.840
like Michael Turner, I'll have a good game turning 22 points for the, for the Mario Lopez dispenser.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.600
I'll send a little message, say, Hey, keep it up. I'm glad that I picked you from a fantasy team.

39:35.600 --> 39:40.000
And then maybe Danny Amendola broke his fucking neck and he got four points for me. I'll say,

39:40.000 --> 39:45.600
Hey, why'd you do that? Daddy needed those points. So you're doing like some, some computer chair

39:45.600 --> 39:51.040
coaching. I'm doing some, uh, some Tweet-O coaching. I'll fly overhead and I'll drop those

39:51.040 --> 39:55.440
sweet messages in their ear. Danny Amendola probably didn't want that. Probably didn't need

39:55.440 --> 39:59.280
that. He probably needed support from his loved ones cause he's probably never going to ball again,

39:59.280 --> 40:07.200
but I needed him to be a point factory, but that sort of positive or negative encouragement is

40:07.200 --> 40:10.880
exactly what those people need to put the, put the PTs up on the board. By which I mean points.

40:10.880 --> 40:17.200
Uh, I, so just brag, brag away. Griffin, can I have a Yahoo, please? You sure can.

40:18.320 --> 40:23.440
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by Maxwell McCandless. Thank you Maxwell. It's by Yahoo answers user

40:23.440 --> 40:30.320
A who asks, my boyfriend goes number two on my bathroom floor. Should I allow this?

40:32.960 --> 40:40.560
I'm asking, I, I could ask the same thing of this question. Can we allow ourselves to discuss this?

40:40.560 --> 40:46.560
Listen, listen to the specifics though. Okay. He says he can't go on a regular toilet because he

40:46.560 --> 40:52.160
has to squat due to a medical problem. Okay. Sure. But he cleaned that's here's the, here's

40:52.160 --> 40:59.200
the kicker. Are you ready? But he cleans up afterward. So the only reason that this woman

40:59.200 --> 41:03.760
knows that this is happening is because he is coming in and going, Hey hun, drop the deuce on

41:03.760 --> 41:08.320
the carpet. Don't worry. Full disclosure. I do not think it's carpet. I hope to God not.

41:08.320 --> 41:16.640
I don't think he could ghost it quite that easy. I think that would be much, much more difficult to

41:16.640 --> 41:22.160
go. I really need to, I really need to make business, but I don't have a spare 45 minutes

41:25.040 --> 41:29.680
for the shampooing and a whole machine upstairs for some reason that grosses me.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.000
You pop back to Tyler linoleum and I can work with it, but

41:36.000 --> 41:42.400
okay. So everything is coated in feces. This is not a stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

41:42.400 --> 41:48.480
You gross me out again. Now I'm saying everything is, is coated in urine and feces. That's like,

41:48.480 --> 41:52.960
that's our world that we live in. Okay. The only time something isn't is direct. I'm sorry, Travis.

41:53.520 --> 41:58.080
The only time it isn't after someone has cleaned it. So what he is offering you is a,

41:58.080 --> 42:03.840
is a more frequent respite from it's a clean. You're going to end up with a cleaner floor.

42:03.840 --> 42:08.560
So you're saying that the only issue here is your mental block of thinking it's weird,

42:09.200 --> 42:14.720
but in reality it's a good thing. Except, except you go in and it smells like

42:14.720 --> 42:21.440
Lysol and the floor is a little wet. It's like he did that to you almost.

42:22.400 --> 42:26.720
Listen, here's the thing in the real world, brothers got a medical condition where he can't

42:26.720 --> 42:30.800
like shit on a real toilet and the doctor just goes, okay, I'm going to send you out in the

42:30.800 --> 42:40.560
world with this condition. You'll be fine. You're just an unacceptable solution. I guess I can give

42:40.560 --> 42:44.160
you, I don't know, a container or something, but I feel that that would inhibit your personal

42:44.160 --> 42:49.360
growth. So just wherever you want. Listen, every time you say a pronoun, you vomit uncontrollably.

42:49.360 --> 42:57.920
Have fun. Have fun out there. That big, flexible spirit. I'm sorry. I'm just getting the hang

42:57.920 --> 43:03.920
of hypnotism. I didn't mean to do that to you. I'm sorry. I'm a hypnotist doctor.

43:04.640 --> 43:08.000
You probably should have come to me before you gave yourself a self colonoscopy.

43:09.120 --> 43:14.640
I've never seen anything quite like this male lactation. See you in a year. Next checkup.

43:14.640 --> 43:20.560
You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Suck it up. Sip some of that sweet milk from me, brother.

43:22.640 --> 43:27.280
I'll put it at my sex level. I'm just saying, is it not a possibility that this boyfriend

43:27.280 --> 43:35.840
just like shitting on his lady's floor? He just likes doing that. Guys, I feel like I'm in the

43:35.840 --> 43:39.840
radiation filled chamber and I've been in for too long and we have to run out of this question.

43:39.840 --> 43:46.160
We have to vent. Okay. There are toilets that they use in Japan that are just holes in the floor.

43:47.040 --> 43:51.760
You should get in one of those and then it won't be a problem. Just don't just shitting on your

43:51.760 --> 43:59.280
floor. I'm sorry. What Travis? Like a disposable cake pan. I cannot run the risk no matter how

43:59.280 --> 44:05.120
infinitesimal. I cannot run the risk of being out of cake pans. There could be an earthquake.

44:05.120 --> 44:13.040
The house would be abandoned for 10 years. You come back a decade. Where did you get this Pyroxid?

44:13.040 --> 44:20.960
Oh, Debbie loaned it to me. No, no, no, no, no. I think so. You're setting yourself up for an

44:20.960 --> 44:25.120
episode of the twilight dead where someone serves you meatloaf and you're like, wait a minute,

44:25.120 --> 44:30.400
does that have a chip in the lower left-hand corner? No. You're setting yourself up to one

44:30.400 --> 44:34.320
day and probably not tomorrow and probably not the day after that, but that day's going to come

44:34.320 --> 44:38.640
where you throw all your dishware away because you forgot which one it was. Because you forgot

44:38.640 --> 44:44.800
to mark it. I can't do this question. The blue one was white or the white one was blue. Oh,

44:44.800 --> 44:50.080
burn it all. Burn the house down. Burn the whole thing down. I started a new job after moving to

44:50.080 --> 44:55.520
NYC three months ago, but the job very quickly became intolerably stressful. I got fed up and

44:55.520 --> 44:59.520
looked for a better job and today I was accepted for a position that's not only better paying,

44:59.520 --> 45:05.920
but in a much less oppressive environment. My current boss exploded when I gave my two weeks

45:05.920 --> 45:10.080
notice. She emailed me four times and called me twice in the course of an hour, all to tell me

45:10.080 --> 45:13.920
how shocked and disappointed she is. How the company is going to be in trouble because they

45:13.920 --> 45:17.760
can't find a replacement in two weeks, et cetera, et cetera. How do I survive the next two weeks in

45:17.760 --> 45:23.120
a hostile guilt tripping environment? I want to make sure I make it to my new job intact,

45:23.120 --> 45:32.960
guilt to the death. Allow me to help you. Stop going. I don't go there anymore. It sounds whack.

45:32.960 --> 45:39.120
It sounds like a horrible place. Yeah. I think if you give someone two weeks notice and they

45:39.120 --> 45:45.840
make it worse for you to be there, they just got a no week's notice. Yeah, because keep in mind,

45:45.840 --> 45:50.880
what kind of wreck is this person going to write you that you would want to provide to

45:50.880 --> 45:55.600
any future employer? You're done there. Well, because here's the thing. Two weeks notice,

45:55.600 --> 46:00.080
really, whether it's in your contract or not, is a courtesy. It's something that's there so that

46:00.080 --> 46:01.440
they have time to- Sure.

46:01.440 --> 46:08.000
It's not like- I mean, let's be honest. If people get laid off all across this country,

46:08.000 --> 46:13.280
don't get the courtesy of a two weeks notice. But traditionally, from what I understand,

46:13.280 --> 46:21.280
I've never quit a job, is that the two weeks is so that they will, that's like the understandable

46:21.280 --> 46:24.720
period for them to find a replacement so that you still get a recommendation out of it.

46:25.280 --> 46:30.000
Yeah, but in this circumstance, she's already got another job. What's the boss going to do? Call

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
and be like, hey, my employee gave me two weeks notice, but I don't want her to quit,

46:34.000 --> 46:41.200
so you shouldn't hire her. Dip. Get out. I would seriously, I don't think you're going

46:41.200 --> 46:45.520
to salvage this, and I know that you want to leave on good terms, but it sounds like these

46:45.520 --> 46:50.000
people have already decided that you're leaving on bad terms. So you might as well meet them halfway

46:50.000 --> 46:52.560
on this. So you're going to need to take a personal day for the next nine days.

46:53.120 --> 46:57.840
Yeah, you're just treating yourself to a personal day. Maybe smoke a little doja and then go in.

46:57.840 --> 47:00.800
Ooh. Ooh, hello. Maybe get a little- Go in drunk.

47:00.800 --> 47:03.760
Maybe get to smoke a little peaches and herb and then go in.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.560
Yeah, I like that. It's like office space,

47:06.560 --> 47:12.400
but instead of getting hypnotized, you get a little dip.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.760
You're ganja-tized.

47:13.760 --> 47:17.920
Okay. Well, I'll work on it. I'll workshop it. I'll come back.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.040
Hip-pot-tized?

47:19.040 --> 47:23.200
Is that any good? Maybe spend an hour with Man for Man's Earth band,

47:23.200 --> 47:28.080
and then you roll in. You say, hey, what's up with the work?

47:28.080 --> 47:28.320
Hey.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.200
Where's the paper at? Let me sign it.

47:32.640 --> 47:34.320
Let me file those reports for you.

47:34.320 --> 47:37.680
Hey, these keys are crazy, man.

47:39.600 --> 47:43.280
We've never smoked a marijuana before, so we're just guessing what it could be.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.000
That's what it's like. Like you're trapped in a glass box.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.720
It makes you talk like a very meek jazz musician.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.440
And he's afraid of waking the baby.

47:51.440 --> 47:54.240
Shh. Hey, no, no, no.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.360
Shhh. Shuffler is sleeping.

47:57.360 --> 47:58.800
Look at that computer screen.

47:58.800 --> 48:05.280
Ooh. I'm gonna type in an email.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.720
I think that'd be such a power play to just start being the guy in your office

48:08.720 --> 48:10.400
who always talk like that.

48:10.400 --> 48:14.240
Just low-talk Greg, and everyone's like, what? Excuse me? What did you say?

48:14.240 --> 48:17.120
They would eventually, even if you had put in your two weeks notice,

48:17.120 --> 48:18.480
they would ask you to stop coming.

48:19.200 --> 48:22.240
I can't hear you over the laser printer. What the fuck did you say?

48:22.240 --> 48:26.880
I can't believe I just sent that email without a subject. Can you believe that?

48:26.880 --> 48:30.720
I wish they put a little guy in there. You could just call it back.

48:30.720 --> 48:31.680
Come on back, email.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.080
I like this guy. I like this guy.

48:38.080 --> 48:40.800
I like this guy, too. Can I talk like this for the rest of my life?

48:41.600 --> 48:43.200
Ah, shit. The printer's broken.

48:43.200 --> 48:43.840
Oh, what's wrong?

48:45.200 --> 48:46.960
Let me take a look at it. Yeah, that's broken.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.800
Oh, you got a jam. Just got a little jam.

48:48.800 --> 48:52.880
We got a little toner bone going on here. I'm gonna fix this right up.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.480
Ooh, got a little on my shirt.

48:54.480 --> 48:57.280
I'll tell you what, why don't you just get that screen

48:57.280 --> 48:59.360
and just read it out loud to the whole office.

49:00.560 --> 49:05.200
I'll get everybody to shut down. Hey, everybody, Philip's gonna read this

49:05.200 --> 49:09.040
real important email about not eating people's lunch out of the fridge.

49:12.160 --> 49:16.240
Go ahead, Philip. As we say in the jazz world, the stage is yours.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.800
Come on. Go on, don't hold back.

49:20.800 --> 49:24.880
Does anybody want some of this? I like your rhythm. That's a good cadence, Philip.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.160
Anybody want some of this, Jay?

49:28.160 --> 49:30.000
Why y'all grimacing at me?

49:30.960 --> 49:34.160
I do want to apologize for bringing my infant son into the office again.

49:35.520 --> 49:39.280
The babysitter canceled, so poor little Grimace had to come along with me.

49:39.280 --> 49:41.440
Plum tuckered out. I did name him after McDonald's.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.600
Hey, anybody want up on this spliff tanning?

49:43.600 --> 49:48.240
Now, what's that? You'd prefer I not return tomorrow? Well, that is, of course, your choice.

49:50.240 --> 49:57.360
I will hate to not live up to my contribution, but I understand sometimes it just don't work out.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.200
It ain't the way of the world.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.320
And now let me sing you this song I wrote about a situation just like this.

50:03.120 --> 50:06.960
I know, it's a little song just like this about a little old caterpillar just wants to

50:06.960 --> 50:12.640
fill up his stores with grain, so he plays his fiddle all winter,

50:12.640 --> 50:16.640
and then the chicken comes along and tries to eat his grain. I'll just be gone. You're right.

50:19.280 --> 50:20.720
It's best I go now.

50:20.720 --> 50:24.160
Do you have a box I can put all my accoutrement in?

50:24.160 --> 50:28.400
Oh, actually, I just have this pen, so I'm just going to take- whoa, you're being a little rough,

50:28.400 --> 50:32.720
sir. There's no need for that. I'll find my way to the elevator. No problem.

50:32.720 --> 50:38.800
At all. I did want to hear the end of Philip's email. Go ahead, Philip.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.360
Philip, you don't have to just sit there staring.

50:41.360 --> 50:42.320
Why y'all crying?

50:42.320 --> 50:44.320
Why's everybody crying?

50:44.320 --> 50:48.800
Philip, maybe you could forward that to me. I do not own a computer. I will read it at the library.

50:50.800 --> 50:55.440
And I, again, I do want to apologize to everybody for me not wearing pants or underwear

50:56.080 --> 50:57.280
into the office today.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.480
I know, I know.

50:58.480 --> 51:02.800
Way from me not wearing pants or underwear into the office today.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.520
I don't even believe I work here now that I look back on it.

51:05.520 --> 51:10.640
Come to think of it, this is Denny's, so I am sorry about this.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.120
This thing I've been typing on, it's been a placemat.

51:14.560 --> 51:17.200
I do understand why my employment is being terminated.

51:17.200 --> 51:21.040
That is not a picture of my wife and kids. That is eggs.

51:23.360 --> 51:26.800
And now let me scat for y'all. It's not what you think.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.960
You guys want us to scat? It's not what you think.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.800
So this has been my brother, my brother, and me.

51:36.240 --> 51:37.680
Too much? Okay, I'll bring it down.

51:38.320 --> 51:40.400
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

51:40.400 --> 51:49.760
It's a comedy advice show, just a couple of three bros, laughing, learning, loving, living, leaping.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.120
Quantum leaping.

51:51.920 --> 51:54.720
Quantum leaping.

51:54.720 --> 51:57.520
I'm just a little old jazz musician who had to go back and say,

51:57.520 --> 51:59.280
right, well, once we were wrong.

51:59.280 --> 52:02.560
It's like three quantum leaps, three old jazz musicians.

52:05.680 --> 52:08.400
We will be back with you next Monday.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.000
Hopefully that will be the leap home.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.840
Unless, of course, we solve the problems of these three brothers' lives.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.520
What happened when we jumped, Ziggy?

52:17.200 --> 52:20.640
We'll consult with Ziggy to see what the problem is.

52:20.640 --> 52:25.600
I thought we did pretty good with all the jokes this week.

52:27.360 --> 52:31.760
Maybe, God, maybe we worked a little blue at some point,

52:31.760 --> 52:33.680
but we haven't been told this was an adult audience.

52:36.560 --> 52:39.120
See, no, we have committed this far.

52:39.120 --> 52:41.920
We're going to drive this baby home.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.840
Hey, do you mind if I take a second to show?

52:43.840 --> 52:44.480
Go ahead, girl.

52:44.480 --> 52:49.200
Let me go and show my little bit of appreciation to Mrs.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.720
Go ahead, little brother.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.080
Go ahead, go ahead.

52:52.080 --> 52:55.360
Jonathan Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

52:55.360 --> 52:58.720
It's an awesome place, baby.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.640
Listen to that.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.400
So we're going to listen.

53:02.400 --> 53:03.840
Girl, you're fading out.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.200
I put it on.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.200
Set this record down on the radio.

53:07.200 --> 53:10.160
We're going to listen to it all the way up to the kids.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.920
I'd like to, you know, little brother, I don't mean to step on your toes,

53:17.920 --> 53:22.320
but I do want to thank the people using Twitter to get their message on out there

53:22.320 --> 53:25.280
about our little comedy show here.

53:25.280 --> 53:34.080
Ejohns88, Vintage Spiffy, you know him, Iggy K, King Mento, Nobody Gaming,

53:34.960 --> 53:39.600
Fox Shet, Bradley McStam, everybody, thank you so much for getting that,

53:39.600 --> 53:40.800
getting that whole word out.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.920
Yeah, I want you to know.

53:43.920 --> 53:46.720
Hey, how about maybe just one more question?

53:46.720 --> 53:48.720
Take us all on into infinity.

53:48.720 --> 53:51.840
Hey, Travis, do want to thank you again for joining us this week.

53:51.840 --> 53:54.320
Talking about your sweet sticky hands.

53:54.320 --> 53:55.360
It's all right, y'all, I know.

53:55.360 --> 53:56.240
I know what you do.

53:56.240 --> 53:56.880
It's fine.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.080
But now that I was good at it.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.400
He just sounds racist.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.760
That's why I'm so quiet.

54:03.840 --> 54:07.040
I knew I shouldn't commit to the bit, so I just got quiet.

54:08.880 --> 54:13.040
The two things that Travis has going for him are hands that smell like

54:13.040 --> 54:17.760
hunted hams and a real honest self-assessment of his talent is really.

54:17.760 --> 54:20.960
I know that voice abilities are not my strong suit.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.560
You're just here.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.360
This year, finally, Yahoo!

54:25.360 --> 54:26.960
Answer was sent in by Emily Wall.

54:26.960 --> 54:27.760
Thank you, Emily.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.120
It's by Yahoo!

54:29.120 --> 54:33.520
Answers user Jolteon01, who asks?

54:35.120 --> 54:39.040
Hey, what's the difference between Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Haley Joel Osmond?

54:39.040 --> 54:45.040
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.560
Why don't you grab your old daddy?

54:46.560 --> 54:47.840
He's just playing sweet.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.040
Right on his livers.

54:50.240 --> 54:51.360
We're here in teams.

54:59.760 --> 55:01.440
Keep your heart three stacks.

55:01.440 --> 55:02.480
Keep your heart.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.640
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

55:04.640 --> 55:05.680
Keep your heart.

55:05.680 --> 55:06.960
Man, these girls are smart.

55:06.960 --> 55:07.600
Three stacks.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.360
These girls are smart.

55:09.360 --> 55:39.120
Play your part.
