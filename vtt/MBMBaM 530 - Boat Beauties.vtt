00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.720
Hello everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, and in my show for the modern era,

00:48.720 --> 00:54.480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:54.480 --> 00:58.400
I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminaire, I haven't said that in a while,

00:58.400 --> 01:03.040
Griffin McElroy, but it's still true. Guys, I'm so excited. Folks at home,

01:03.040 --> 01:05.760
you're going to be so excited. We got a special guest with us this week.

01:06.480 --> 01:12.080
You'll never believe it. It's the my brother, my brother, and me fall time prize mummy.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.520
What? Oh, the prize mummy's back.

01:13.520 --> 01:16.800
Do you just remember the prize mummy? The fall time prize mummy.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.680
Yeah. The prize mummy.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.720
We did him back in what, 2012? Yeah.

01:23.680 --> 01:27.920
I have no memory of the things you're saying.

01:27.920 --> 01:33.600
We did prize mummy in 2012, 2013. I think that was the last one. We changed up the rules each

01:33.600 --> 01:38.320
time. One, you had to rip a bandage off, and however much you got off, you got that much back

01:38.320 --> 01:40.880
in store credit. That's right.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.200
I mean, it sounds funny. I'm wild about it over here.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.800
It was young as fuck. It was funny as fuck, and it's only going to be funnier.

01:46.800 --> 01:54.720
He used to be the Halloween prize mummy, and then we did some focus testing, and that wasn't playing

01:54.720 --> 01:59.680
super well with our Christian base, so he became the fall time prize mummy.

02:00.240 --> 02:03.520
That might be why you don't remember him right away, but he's back.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.160
He's here sitting next to me. Very close.

02:08.160 --> 02:15.040
The focus group also said they preferred the mummy to be dead, like a historical,

02:15.040 --> 02:18.560
in a museum, dead mummy, and didn't get up and move around.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.920
But at that point, what's the game? If you're not chasing the mummy down trying to rip off

02:21.920 --> 02:25.920
its precious expensive bandages that you can trade in for store credit at Dick's Sporting

02:25.920 --> 02:27.280
Goods, what's the fucking point?

02:29.120 --> 02:36.800
It's been a little while. The mummy has asked if he could share some of his political opinions.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.800
He can't speak to air those opinions out, right?

02:42.800 --> 02:50.640
Right. If he does try, scarabs fly out of his mouth, which is rather unpleasant, so I'd rather

02:50.640 --> 02:52.320
he didn't do that. I guess just interpret him for a

02:52.320 --> 02:56.160
trab and maybe clean him up a little bit. I'm going to try to.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.600
Okay, so he's holding up a sign here. Okay, well that's interesting.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.040
On this one, he's written that women should get the vote.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.640
Oh my god, prize mummy. Yeah, no, we did that.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.520
He's underlining an exclamation point, exclamation point. Okay.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.760
Yeah. Oh, he's crossing it out.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.880
Oh, oh, oh, wait. Oh.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.200
What's that mean then? He's now just nodding slowly.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.160
Oh no. Oh, prize mummy.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.480
I don't feel like any prizes have even been exchanged at this point.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.800
No, he's kind of holding them hostage at this point. He's got them all tucked behind him

03:36.800 --> 03:40.880
and he's holding a finger out at me and waggling it and pointing at his dry erase board.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.880
Trev, can you sneak a peek? Can you sneak a peek at the prizes?

03:44.880 --> 03:48.240
What do we got? Oh, it's a, huh.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.080
It's a lot of cans without labels.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.360
Can you ask him where he got those from?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.520
Yeah, let me, oh my honey. Prize mummy?

04:04.080 --> 04:07.760
I've already seen that it's cans. Where'd you get the can?

04:07.760 --> 04:09.520
Okay, you're shrugging. You can't shrug.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.880
You got the cans from somewhere. Where did he, he's doing like a,

04:12.880 --> 04:15.280
I'll never tell. I'm a little stinker kind of thing.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.160
Prize mummy, where did you get the cans?

04:18.160 --> 04:22.960
I think, Trev, maybe the more important question is where did you get the prize mummy?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.560
Yeah, where did you find the prize mummy?

04:24.560 --> 04:29.360
Because as I understand it, he's apparently been idle for a few years.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.320
Yeah, well, no, this isn't the original prize mummy.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.880
The original prize mummy is working in LA now.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.800
This, I got this prize mummy off of Cincinnati Craigslist.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.800
But he told me he is a certified prize mummy with the guild.

04:44.800 --> 04:49.920
Yeah, he told you that. And what did that exchange look like when you,

04:50.960 --> 04:55.760
I'm guessing, rented a budget truck to pick up, did it come with sarcophagus?

04:57.360 --> 05:02.400
Of sorts. It was mostly, can I be honest?

05:02.400 --> 05:02.880
Yeah.

05:02.880 --> 05:07.840
It was just an old foot locker that he was in.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.200
The store, like the store?

05:10.160 --> 05:11.040
No, Griffin, don't be ridiculous.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.160
You bought a foot locker at an old mall?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.240
And then there was just a mummy inside?

05:16.240 --> 05:16.800
Now hold on.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.320
No, okay, I can see the confusion.

05:18.320 --> 05:24.560
I did not buy the foot locker shoe store, but I did buy an old chest, a foot locker at a mall.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.320
And he was inside of there reading a book.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.440
And the book was men are from Mars and women are from Venus, which was weird.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.720
That is weird.

05:34.720 --> 05:40.080
And so I think mummy in the foot locker is a really good episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?

05:41.840 --> 05:42.800
I think that would be good.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.960
And we could do a fun bit where he is wearing Air Jordans.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.200
Was he buried in the foot locker?

05:49.200 --> 05:52.480
So maybe he was buried in the box at the store?

05:52.480 --> 05:53.040
Is that right?

05:53.040 --> 05:55.600
Can you ask when he was mummified?

05:55.600 --> 05:59.040
Because it's starting to sound like the answer might be like 1979.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.800
Let me ask, when were you mummified?

06:00.800 --> 06:01.520
Last week?

06:02.320 --> 06:02.880
Last week.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.200
Okay, okay, that's not a mummy.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.320
That's not a mummy, that's a dead person.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.200
That's a dead body.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.640
Okay, well, get out of here.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.600
Let's find out what these prizes are, though, before we go kicking this cadaver out.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.280
Can I open one can at least?

06:19.280 --> 06:20.320
Can I open a can?

06:21.440 --> 06:23.520
Okay, he's carefully picking which can.

06:24.720 --> 06:25.600
How do you know what they are?

06:25.600 --> 06:26.640
There's no labels.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.760
Oh, okay, this one, I should open this one.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.080
Okay, let me open this one.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.800
Okay, oh, oh, okay.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.720
It's, huh, it's alphabet soup.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.320
Oh.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.920
Okay, but it's, oh, all the words are dirty words.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.760
It's just spelling out dirty words everywhere.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.560
He's giggling.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.160
How is that possible?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.840
Yeah, I don't know.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.680
But no, you do know, you're there.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.520
Well, it's just every time I shake the can a little bit,

06:57.520 --> 07:02.160
the letters that float to the top are saying like poopy butt kind of thing.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.280
So it's like a magic eight ball, but it's soup.

07:05.280 --> 07:05.920
Soup?

07:05.920 --> 07:07.600
Yeah, oh, he's casting a spell.

07:09.200 --> 07:09.440
Okay.

07:11.200 --> 07:11.440
Okay.

07:13.200 --> 07:13.600
Uh-huh.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.320
Oh, no, sorry, it's just a card trick.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.320
Sorry, I misunderstood what he was doing.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.040
Oh, it's pretty good.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, that is my card.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.040
Wait.

07:21.040 --> 07:21.280
Oh.

07:22.080 --> 07:25.440
Man, Trav, you really had us going with this prize mummy thing,

07:25.440 --> 07:28.480
but I feel like the last couple seconds have really been a...

07:28.480 --> 07:31.120
Yeah, I think we understand now what this is.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.400
Well, he left.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.560
If I'm being honest, he left as soon as I started asking questions about the cans.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.400
He got pretty squarely and he left.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.720
So I was covering for that because I didn't want you guys to know that he's loose.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.840
And I'm sorry about that, world.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.320
I set him free from the Foot Locker in the Foot Locker,

07:50.320 --> 07:55.600
and now the prize mummy could be coming to your town today.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.080
So he could be anywhere at this point.

07:58.080 --> 07:58.640
Yeah.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.200
Do you think Brendan knows whenever this happens?

08:03.200 --> 08:05.120
Well, he gets a call from the government, doesn't he?

08:05.120 --> 08:06.560
Okay, yeah, sure.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.920
Should we have asked him to do this bit with us?

08:09.920 --> 08:10.960
Brendan Fraser?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.560
It feels intentional now, doesn't it?

08:12.560 --> 08:13.440
It does a little bit.

08:13.440 --> 08:13.680
Yeah.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.360
To not to keep him out.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.200
Fuck, I would love to get Brendan Fraser on the show.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.160
Fuck, I would love to do that.

08:18.160 --> 08:18.960
God, I'd love it.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.760
That would be cool.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.560
That would be cool.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.720
He doesn't have to talk about the mummy.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.840
No.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.800
Unless he wants to.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.040
If he wants to, of course.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.000
He doesn't have to talk about the mummy,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.240
he just has to vanquish the Cincinnati mummy

08:32.240 --> 08:35.600
that Travis has now just let loose upon the world.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.240
Yeah, and I said I was sorry.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.240
If anybody knows Brendan, that never works.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.520
But if you do know Brendan personally,

08:45.520 --> 08:47.680
I'd love to get him on the show just to talk.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.840
I feel like there's so much we could talk about.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.000
I'll talk to him about Blast from the Past.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.280
Sure, absolutely.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.120
I'll talk to him about his arc on Scrubs,

08:55.120 --> 08:56.320
which is really good.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.160
Oh, it's great on Scrubs.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.280
George of the Jungle.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.960
Gods and Monsters?

09:00.960 --> 09:01.840
Are you kidding me?

09:01.840 --> 09:03.200
Come on, what a talent.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.960
I love Brendan.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.640
Doom Squad.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.720
Anyway, this is my brother on Brother Man.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.800
Encino Man.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.300
Yeah.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.920
You know, Encino Man set up a big sequel.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.520
The big sequel on Encino Man that they never paid off.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.840
I'm still a little chuffed, a little chafed.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.680
Admit you Googled bedazzled.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.800
There's no way you remember.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.240
Actually, no one remembers the existence of bedazzled.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.760
You tell me you Googled it.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.160
That was bedazzled with Elizabeth Hurley

09:32.160 --> 09:33.440
was also in the film.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.840
That doesn't prove that you didn't Google it.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.880
Maybe me and Travis are just big bedazzle heads.

09:38.880 --> 09:39.380
Yeah.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.360
This isn't my show.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.200
And we're going to...

09:43.200 --> 09:46.720
We're going to be helping everybody.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.560
Whether they want it or not.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.160
We have an excited promotion in the second half of the show.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.960
We will talk about what to do with the teeth.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.400
Just passing mention here.

10:00.960 --> 10:06.320
Don't anybody else email us what you do with teeth.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.120
Now it's bad.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.960
Maybe you should explain for people who missed that episode

10:10.960 --> 10:14.000
what you just said is probably the wildest shit they've ever heard.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.640
They should listen to that episode then, I guess.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.880
And I'm not going to backtrack for people.

10:18.880 --> 10:23.600
We had someone had some teeth that they wanted to unload

10:23.600 --> 10:27.760
and we offered to kind of like Craigslist it for them on our show.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.960
So we had a bunch of people.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.360
Well, you'll see.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.560
Let's talk about it later.

10:32.560 --> 10:37.600
Right now, I want to talk about you.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.100
Me?

10:38.100 --> 10:38.640
The listener.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.760
Me?

10:39.760 --> 10:41.040
No, not never you.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.040
Here comes the questions.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.560
I need to take a drug test for a boat captain's license I'm getting.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.560
These can be expensive when your company isn't making you do it on their dime.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.080
However, I'm also currently job hunting.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.280
So the interviews I want to ask if there is a drug test

10:57.280 --> 11:00.160
but because I want to take it since they will pay for it.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.560
Wait, okay, hold on.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.760
Wait, okay.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.680
Okay, this person needs a drug test.

11:05.680 --> 11:11.040
So they're trying to get a job so they can get a complimentary drug test.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.880
Yes, as I understand it.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.380
Yes.

11:13.920 --> 11:14.420
Yes.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.080
How do I ask if there's a drug test in a way that indicates

11:18.080 --> 11:20.560
I actually want to take the drug test?

11:21.200 --> 11:21.700
Wow.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.000
Charles, youngest of three brothers.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.040
That is actually.

11:25.040 --> 11:25.540
Jesus.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.520
You have to float this as reverse reverse psychology where it's like

11:32.080 --> 11:33.760
if you say like, oh, and is there a drug test?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.960
Because I really want to take one.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.160
They're going to think you're asking that because you don't want to take one.

11:38.160 --> 11:43.040
How do you then flip it back judo style to the other side?

11:43.040 --> 11:47.520
I tell you, there's another trick to it too.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.440
Where you say, is there a drug test?

11:49.440 --> 11:50.720
I really want to take it, right?

11:50.720 --> 11:52.160
Or is there, let's start here.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.200
Is there a drug test?

11:53.200 --> 11:56.480
Now they're thinking it's because they're worried about drugs

11:56.480 --> 11:59.840
and they take drugs and that's why they're asking.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.920
But the other option is then you say because I really want to take it

12:03.920 --> 12:05.280
and I'm not afraid of it at all.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.440
And then they say, oh, okay.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.440
Well, then like, why even bother doing the drug test

12:11.440 --> 12:12.880
if they're asking to take it?

12:13.600 --> 12:14.880
They're probably good.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.400
So let's not worry about it.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.600
Are you suggesting you roll up and you're like, what's up?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.200
My name is Grungy Doob Lord.

12:21.760 --> 12:26.800
And I really, oh boy, I got a question to ask you,

12:26.800 --> 12:28.320
but I don't know if I should.

12:28.320 --> 12:35.040
Y'all don't do, y'all don't do drug tests, do you?

12:35.040 --> 12:38.720
There's, okay, risk of this, risk of this,

12:38.720 --> 12:42.480
is that they're so enchanted by Grungy Doob Lord

12:42.480 --> 12:44.800
that they actually are like, we normally do,

12:44.800 --> 12:48.400
but I definitely do like you on staff and we're gonna wave it.

12:48.960 --> 12:52.000
You have, if I may, an intoxicating presence.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.200
I am, if you'll forgive, addicted to Grungy Doob Lord

12:59.200 --> 13:02.080
and I do wanna have you on staff.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.440
So we're gonna wave the drug test

13:03.440 --> 13:04.880
or I'll give you some of my piss.

13:05.680 --> 13:06.720
Are you sure?

13:06.720 --> 13:11.440
Cause I'm happy to take the drug test if you need me.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.920
I wanna party with you Grungy Doob Lord

13:13.920 --> 13:16.720
and whatever that it takes.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.840
But I like getting high on the rules.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.400
So as well as drugs.

13:22.400 --> 13:27.600
So I mean, maybe if there's a drug test, that's cool.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.800
I was gonna suggest that you just like be honest

13:30.800 --> 13:32.800
because that would be like a very memorable thing

13:32.800 --> 13:33.920
in an interview if you're like,

13:34.880 --> 13:35.840
do you guys do drug tests?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.280
Cause I'd actually love to take one

13:37.280 --> 13:41.120
because I need it for my boat captain's license.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.480
That'd be extremely memorable.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.680
But if I'm a hiring manager,

13:45.840 --> 13:48.320
that is gonna raise a huge red flag with me.

13:48.320 --> 13:52.800
Like once you get permission to get out

13:53.440 --> 13:54.720
in those beautiful waves,

13:55.840 --> 13:58.560
then I'm gonna lose you to Lady C.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.920
You ain't coming back.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.520
You're Poseidon's girlfriend now.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.360
You're not returning.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.120
I am but a port that you have stopped in

14:09.120 --> 14:10.960
on your way to bigger and better things,

14:10.960 --> 14:12.800
by which I mean the ocean,

14:12.800 --> 14:16.240
which is both bigger and better than any job I could offer you.

14:16.240 --> 14:23.200
Unless the job is for an airline pilot,

14:23.200 --> 14:24.960
at which point that is better.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.320
That is one step above.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.440
Yeah, but there's no way

14:29.440 --> 14:30.960
they're gonna fucking trust you then.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.920
There's no way the air pilots would trust a boat pilot

14:38.560 --> 14:41.360
or a potential a wannabe boat pilot.

14:41.360 --> 14:45.360
You can't have dominion over the sky and the sea.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.200
What do you think you are?

14:47.200 --> 14:50.240
I'm saying, okay, the structure as we all know,

14:51.200 --> 14:52.880
at the top is astronaut,

14:53.680 --> 14:54.960
then airline pilot,

14:55.760 --> 14:57.360
then boat captain,

14:57.920 --> 15:00.240
then river boat captain,

15:01.040 --> 15:04.320
then subway driver.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.160
Long-haul trucker I think beats subway driver.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.680
Okay, yeah, long-haul trucker,

15:09.680 --> 15:11.200
then subway driver,

15:11.200 --> 15:12.800
then subway sandwich artist,

15:12.800 --> 15:15.760
and then just any kind of digger,

15:15.760 --> 15:18.640
anybody who just digs into the ground with a big drill, right?

15:19.440 --> 15:22.640
I think they put them above the subway sandwich artists.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.120
Oh, really?

15:23.120 --> 15:25.360
And you also skip like train engineer, like above.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.960
No, that's counted in river boat driver

15:28.960 --> 15:32.400
because the railways are the rivers of the earth.

15:33.920 --> 15:34.480
That's cool.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.000
Metal rivers crisscross this beautiful land

15:38.000 --> 15:39.680
that we call America.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.080
Exactly.

15:40.080 --> 15:43.600
And just America, we're the only ones with trains.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.280
Well, still, I mean at this point.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.320
We should do trains at some point, right?

15:48.320 --> 15:51.200
America's going all around, hither and yon,

15:51.200 --> 15:52.720
so freaking fast.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.880
Man, America's really buying into trains, huh?

15:54.880 --> 15:56.240
Should we buy into trains?

15:56.880 --> 15:57.380
Nah.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.200
Nah, it's a sucker's bet.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.800
Nah, we're still using those boats

16:00.800 --> 16:03.520
that horses pulled along by the side of the river

16:03.520 --> 16:05.840
because we don't know how sails work, I guess.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.600
Hey, do you want to yacht?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.920
This question is so regressive and weird.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.440
The question's not regressive and weird,

16:13.440 --> 16:16.240
but why do boat captains have to take a drug test?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.640
Is it so important that- Captain Ron.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.960
Captain, do you think Captain Ron

16:20.960 --> 16:22.400
set a bad precedent?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.200
He ruined it.

16:23.200 --> 16:23.700
Yep.

16:24.480 --> 16:24.980
Okay.

16:26.000 --> 16:26.640
I'm just saying-

16:26.640 --> 16:27.280
That doesn't make sense.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.400
That's such a good answer.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.200
I get why you maybe don't want your sky pilot

16:31.200 --> 16:34.240
to be like under the influence,

16:34.240 --> 16:35.920
but a boat captain,

16:35.920 --> 16:39.840
I feel like it's pretty hard to crash a boat, right?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.360
Well, I mean, okay, here's the thing.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.640
I will say, I would like-

16:42.640 --> 16:44.080
Well, I mean, it's to the contrary.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.000
I mean, people are crashing boats.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.600
But here's, to that point, Justin,

16:47.600 --> 16:50.320
I would like my boat captain to be sober

16:50.320 --> 16:53.120
at the beginning and ending of the journey.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.440
In the middle there, lot of open water.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.440
That's it, you're throwing a dart

16:57.440 --> 16:58.720
and just letting it fly.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.240
And while it's flying, just like,

17:00.240 --> 17:04.800
hey, we're cruising, so now I'm cruising for a boozing.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.480
Yep. Catch you later.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.680
I'm thinking of, I guess,

17:11.040 --> 17:13.200
cruise ships and yachts and shit like that.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.560
If you're in a little speedboat,

17:14.560 --> 17:17.120
yeah, you should definitely, definitely tighten up.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.800
I got a Yahoo here.

17:20.800 --> 17:24.160
And this one was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.760
Hey, beautiful, beautiful dovetailing here.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.240
Thanks, Graham.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.400
It's Yahoo Answers user Katie J who asks,

17:31.040 --> 17:33.600
what's the easiest way to get a free boat?

17:33.600 --> 17:35.520
I want a boat, but I don't have any money.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.880
How can I get one for free?

17:38.400 --> 17:38.800
Huh?

17:39.760 --> 17:42.720
I mean, if you wait until a very intoxicated person

17:42.720 --> 17:44.960
falls out of their boat, but the boat's still moving,

17:44.960 --> 17:48.080
if you can catch it, round it up, free boat.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
I get, okay, first things first,

17:51.520 --> 17:54.320
we need to define some terms, right?

17:54.320 --> 17:57.920
Because boat could, like, are we not,

17:57.920 --> 18:01.040
I mean, are we, and of course not a toy, Griffin,

18:01.040 --> 18:03.040
but I'm saying, are we talking about perhaps

18:03.040 --> 18:06.560
a, like, simple, you know, like floats on the water,

18:06.560 --> 18:10.560
holds maybe like one person, like, you know, a duck?

18:10.560 --> 18:11.680
Yeah, that's the minimum, yes.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.600
Okay, then I have learned from watching many movies

18:15.600 --> 18:17.760
that people often just leave those things,

18:18.400 --> 18:21.760
like on the seashore, perhaps, turned upside down

18:21.760 --> 18:23.200
with a crab living underneath it.

18:24.720 --> 18:30.560
You might just find one, like, on a creek, you know,

18:30.560 --> 18:31.440
washed up.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.600
In a river delta somewhere.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.440
Yeah, right, right, right, right, right, right.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.360
So I think it's just that's persistence.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.520
Now, if you're talking about a quality boat,

18:42.480 --> 18:44.720
you're talking about a boat that others will envy.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.960
Now you're speaking my language.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.040
I was watching this series,

18:50.640 --> 18:52.480
I can't remember if it was on TikTok,

18:52.480 --> 18:53.520
it was probably on TikTok,

18:54.160 --> 18:56.320
where somebody was doing some trading

18:56.880 --> 18:59.600
and they started with, like, a bobby pin

18:59.600 --> 19:02.080
and then they just went from person to person,

19:02.080 --> 19:03.520
seeing if they could trade up

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
until they traded for a house.

19:06.560 --> 19:07.920
So why not do that?

19:08.480 --> 19:09.760
Start trading for a boat.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.040
I don't want me to think about it, but that's not free.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.360
Well, you get the bobby pin for free.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.360
If you told me right now you would give me $100

19:18.080 --> 19:19.440
if I could give you a bobby pin,

19:19.440 --> 19:20.720
I don't think I could find,

19:20.720 --> 19:22.080
like, I'm not sure I could find one.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.160
Well, what's the equivalent you could find?

19:24.160 --> 19:25.920
Justin doesn't have to be a bobby pin.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.840
It could be a safety pin.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.960
It could be a button.

19:31.760 --> 19:32.720
You have a boat?

19:32.720 --> 19:33.200
A boat for a boat.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.960
I'll trade you this bobby pin for that boat.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.400
Boat for boat.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.440
Boat for boat.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.320
I'm a B for B.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.480
I'm on Craigslist looking B for B.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.000
You gotta start with a small boat

19:42.000 --> 19:43.200
and you start trading up

19:43.200 --> 19:45.200
until you get to your own cruise ship.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.400
Hey, no fucking games.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.640
I'm trying to do a B for B trade here

19:48.640 --> 19:50.000
in Austin, Texas, hit me up.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.720
No fucking drama here.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.240
Tell us about your boat

19:54.240 --> 19:56.080
to see if anybody else is interested.

19:56.080 --> 19:56.880
They bought their boat,

19:56.880 --> 19:58.000
now they're having second thoughts

19:58.000 --> 19:58.400
and they're like,

19:58.400 --> 19:59.920
maybe this wasn't the boat for me,

19:59.920 --> 20:00.960
but maybe, Griffin,

20:00.960 --> 20:02.080
your boat is the boat for them.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.280
So tell them about your boat.

20:04.080 --> 20:04.580
Gray.

20:05.280 --> 20:05.920
Ooh.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.000
White, gray stripes, blue.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.040
It looks like one of those

20:11.200 --> 20:14.480
cups with the cool, sort of gray,

20:14.480 --> 20:16.000
seafoam blue pattern

20:16.000 --> 20:17.600
spraying across the back of it.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.480
Like a Dixie cup?

20:19.200 --> 20:20.080
Like a Dixie cup.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.600
And on the back it says

20:21.600 --> 20:23.760
boat.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.000
It says hard boat.

20:27.120 --> 20:27.680
Hard boat.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.920
How big is it, Griffin?

20:29.920 --> 20:31.200
How big is your boat?

20:31.920 --> 20:32.400
Six feet.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.560
Wow, nice.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.680
Is that?

20:35.680 --> 20:36.880
How wide is it?

20:36.880 --> 20:38.720
Six feet tall.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.160
50 feet long.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.280
Wait, and how wide?

20:45.280 --> 20:46.320
Griffin, this is so important.

20:46.320 --> 20:46.800
How wide?

20:47.680 --> 20:48.320
Six feet.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.040
It's a submarine.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.800
So it's six feet?

20:50.800 --> 20:53.840
It's six feet tall and six feet wide

20:53.840 --> 20:55.520
and 50 feet long.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.560
Yeah, if you're in a hard boat,

20:56.560 --> 20:57.280
you know what's up.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.320
Carry or go out to the ocean,

21:00.960 --> 21:01.760
rent a boat.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.000
Okay.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.280
Okay, I have two plans.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.520
Rent a boat, keep going.

21:08.160 --> 21:08.480
Free.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.320
Free boat.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.360
It's free.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.160
That's a free boat.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.120
If there's a deposit,

21:14.640 --> 21:16.800
listen, let's fucking allow

21:16.800 --> 21:17.920
this one technicality.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.920
If there's like a $150 deposit,

21:19.920 --> 21:23.440
but it's still a free boat.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.800
Yeah, if you compare it to boat,

21:24.800 --> 21:25.280
it's free.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.600
So that's the one option.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.800
If you don't want to get all nasty about it,

21:30.800 --> 21:32.240
what I would do is rent a boat,

21:33.040 --> 21:35.680
get a big tank of boat gas

21:36.560 --> 21:39.680
and then drive around in the ocean

21:40.240 --> 21:43.680
looking for someone that has run out of gas.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.640
Sorry, regular gas or boat gas?

21:46.640 --> 21:49.680
No, yes, of course.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.400
Sorry, thank you.

21:50.400 --> 21:54.320
Chunky, extra chunky boat gas.

21:54.320 --> 21:54.560
Yeah.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.560
Now we're not talking about sailboat oil,

21:58.560 --> 21:59.360
right Justin?

21:59.360 --> 22:01.040
We're talking about specifically

22:01.040 --> 22:02.400
engine boat gas, right?

22:03.040 --> 22:05.280
Yeah, for engine boats.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.720
Yeah, boat gas.

22:06.720 --> 22:06.960
Okay.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.000
So you drive around,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.200
you find some wood,

22:09.200 --> 22:10.800
it was run out of boat gas.

22:10.800 --> 22:11.040
Okay.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.680
And they're like,

22:13.680 --> 22:16.720
fuck, this sucks.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.840
I'm never getting home to my beautiful husband

22:19.840 --> 22:20.880
and my eight sons.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.520
Don't worry about it, sir.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.640
I have boat gas for you.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.120
Okay.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.000
The only trade that we need to make is

22:30.800 --> 22:31.840
I need that boat.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.120
But you have a boat.

22:33.120 --> 22:33.680
It's mine.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.240
But no, this is a rental.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.600
You take this rental back,

22:39.440 --> 22:42.240
and I'll fill up your boat with boat gas,

22:42.240 --> 22:43.280
but it's mine.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.960
This is a B2B trade.

22:44.960 --> 22:45.600
Yeah, no games.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.440
The rental's still going to get back

22:47.440 --> 22:49.360
and that person gets to live on.

22:50.320 --> 22:54.240
Now, I want to hit you with a second sub plan.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.920
This one's extra spicy,

22:55.920 --> 23:00.800
so you really want to send the kids out of the room,

23:00.800 --> 23:02.160
but starve them out.

23:02.160 --> 23:02.960
Oh no.

23:02.960 --> 23:03.440
Okay, wait.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.280
So they run out of gas.

23:06.080 --> 23:06.960
There's actually,

23:06.960 --> 23:08.160
now that I think about it,

23:08.160 --> 23:08.640
they have,

23:09.200 --> 23:10.720
if you want to get Mad Max about it,

23:10.720 --> 23:12.560
they have nothing to offer you,

23:12.560 --> 23:16.720
you know, so just wait until they have perished.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.840
Now, you're going to risk a Coast Guard rescue in this option.

23:19.840 --> 23:20.080
Yeah.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.160
And you, and let me tell you, friend,

23:22.160 --> 23:25.040
if the Coast Guard shows up at your park next door

23:25.040 --> 23:26.080
like a vulture,

23:26.080 --> 23:27.840
they are going to have a word with you.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.440
I'm just waiting for a free boat.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.480
Yeah, I was going to take this and they died.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.200
I was just waiting.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.440
I wasn't actively hurting them,

23:36.000 --> 23:37.600
but I wasn't helping either.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.560
I wasn't helping.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.520
There's no rule that says I have to help, officer.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.120
International waters.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.760
You are 20 feet from the beach.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.480
They could have swam then.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.960
This person deserves whatever they get.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.160
Guys, I'm thinking about it.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.200
There's so many fucking ways to get a free boat.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.400
It's wild that we all don't have boats at this point.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.440
I'm sitting here thinking about all the boat captains

24:05.440 --> 24:08.320
I could seduce and take their boats from.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.240
Why haven't I been doing that already

24:10.240 --> 24:11.920
just for the sport?

24:11.920 --> 24:13.760
Yeah, I mean, my ways don't involve

24:14.400 --> 24:18.240
as much sort of murder or wrongful death

24:18.240 --> 24:20.480
as the two of you are sort of floating.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.120
Whoa, whoa.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.960
Neither of mine involved in murder.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.960
I said seduction, Griffin.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.720
Consensual seduction.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.640
Seduction that you then throw them

24:28.640 --> 24:29.920
over the edge of the boat.

24:29.920 --> 24:33.360
No, Griffin, I seduced them on land

24:34.000 --> 24:36.560
and then once our lovemaking has exhausted them

24:36.560 --> 24:38.160
beyond their ability to mobilize-

24:38.160 --> 24:39.040
You steal their boat.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.800
I steal their boat and then I sail it to the next port,

24:42.800 --> 24:44.080
seduced again.

24:44.080 --> 24:44.960
The perfect crime.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.360
And Griffin, can I tell you?

24:47.360 --> 24:50.560
I give that boat to my newly seduced captain

24:50.560 --> 24:51.360
and take their boat.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.920
You don't try and sail two boats at the same time?

24:53.920 --> 24:54.320
You fucking-

24:54.320 --> 24:55.760
No, I tried that in college.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.440
Yeah, didn't work.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.320
One foot on each one.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.520
It always sounds good, doesn't it?

24:59.520 --> 25:01.120
Yeah, it sounds good.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.640
It sounds good.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.200
You go to boat rental place to go back to that well.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.720
You go back to boat rental place.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.360
You sail away in a beautiful, beautiful boat.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.800
If you do a deposit, it's fine.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.840
You eat that deposit.

25:11.840 --> 25:12.320
It's gone.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.920
And then you park it up the jetty

25:16.560 --> 25:18.960
and you come back without it and you say,

25:18.960 --> 25:21.120
ah, wouldn't you fucking know it?

25:21.120 --> 25:22.240
Big storm.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.440
The perfect storm.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.400
White squall.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.920
Very localized.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.720
Very localized.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.280
Sunk to the bottom of Davy Jones' locker.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.320
Anyway, can I get another boat?

25:32.320 --> 25:33.840
And my deposit back.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.800
It wasn't my fault.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.080
White squall.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.400
Perfect storm, please.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.920
And you have insurance, right?

25:44.080 --> 25:47.520
That's also, that is an insurance loophole

25:47.520 --> 25:51.520
that if it's perfect storm, you are not liable for that.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.480
What are you gonna do?

25:52.480 --> 25:54.000
What the fuck are you supposed to do?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.840
The storm is perfect.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.760
If you can avoid it, it ain't perfect.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.080
A lot of times you see a storm

26:00.080 --> 26:02.160
and you think it's about to knock your boat over

26:02.160 --> 26:03.520
and it looks almost perfect.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.200
You're like, fuck, I hope this gets a bit worse.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.080
Because if not, I'm gonna be in kind of the,

26:08.080 --> 26:11.840
you're gonna fall in between perfect, like imperfect storm.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.040
A pretty good storm.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.960
Yeah, a pretty good storm.

26:16.880 --> 26:17.680
Oh man.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.760
You could also inherit your granddaddy's boat.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.880
That's just another option.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.040
Yeah, yeah, but you gotta be good to your granddad, don't you?

26:25.040 --> 26:27.120
Yeah, that's not worth it.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.960
I just also really wanted to real quick,

26:28.960 --> 26:30.960
there's a sidebar here with trending questions

26:30.960 --> 26:34.720
and one of them says, are yacht and boat owners right

26:34.720 --> 26:36.160
that support Trump or no,

26:36.160 --> 26:40.080
but also they misspelled yacht and they spelled it yatch

26:40.080 --> 26:42.720
and that's the only way I'm referring to that type of boat

26:42.720 --> 26:44.720
from now on and I would encourage our listeners

26:44.720 --> 26:47.840
to do the same, get me a big fucking bright turbo yatch.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.240
Turbo yatch with a big engine,

26:52.240 --> 26:54.240
chock full of fuel, me and my friends out on the water.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.600
Lots of boat gas.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.840
Lots of bruise, lots of extra chunky boat gas

26:57.840 --> 27:00.240
with boat jelly floating around in there.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.840
Just sailing around on our yacht.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.680
Maybe some boat beauties.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.080
Oh, come on, Travis.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.320
Some shrimp, shrimp cocktails.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.320
Yes, I said boat beauties.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.600
Oh, sorry, I forgot that Travis calls shrimp cocktail

27:13.600 --> 27:14.400
boat beauties.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.640
Shrimp cocktail is, I'm glad somebody finally had the guts

27:24.640 --> 27:27.920
to say it, is the wildest dish ever.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.880
Like you imagine that one a lot as a kid.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.720
Shrimp cocktail, someone put it around in a circle

27:34.720 --> 27:36.640
and then fill a glass with ice and said,

27:36.640 --> 27:37.520
I guess it's done.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.880
They put a little cocktail sauce somewhere adjacent

27:40.880 --> 27:42.640
and you get a cocktail.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.760
It's like somebody just delivered a handful of loose shrimp

27:45.760 --> 27:47.040
and they said, where do I put this?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.120
And they said, well, you finished your drink.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.720
Just put it in there.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.520
Travis renaming shrimp cocktail as boat beauties

27:53.520 --> 27:57.200
might be the true legacy of this show

27:57.200 --> 27:59.040
long after it is gone.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.080
Because I'm thinking about it.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.360
I've never seen a shrimp cocktail going around

28:03.360 --> 28:06.320
at some sort of event or even sitting on a table

28:06.320 --> 28:09.360
at an event and not done the finger wiggling,

28:09.360 --> 28:12.160
like, ooh, what are these?

28:13.920 --> 28:17.200
Don't mind, but I might help myself too.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.320
Shrimp cocktail seems like something somebody did

28:22.320 --> 28:24.000
as a joke in the forties.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.800
You know what I mean?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.520
Like, and here's a shrimp cocktail

28:27.520 --> 28:29.920
because it's a bunch of shrimp in a cocktail glass.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.760
Everybody got a good laugh about it.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.760
And then there was one idiot there who's like,

28:33.760 --> 28:35.520
I guess that's how fancy people do it.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.120
Yeah, I'm going to do this forever.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.280
I'm going to do this at everything I go to forever.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.040
It's a British thing.

28:42.160 --> 28:42.960
What is?

28:43.760 --> 28:44.880
Shrimp cocktail.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.480
They call it prawn cocktail over there.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.160
It's probably a fanocratic joint,

28:48.160 --> 28:50.400
which makes actual perfect sense.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.920
The great British meal.

28:51.920 --> 29:01.920
Okay, this was a three-part meal that was a shrimp cocktail

29:01.920 --> 29:06.880
and then steak and chips and a black forest cake.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.120
Ooh, decadent.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.520
That sounds so good right now.

29:11.520 --> 29:12.320
Decadent.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.040
So you start with the boat beauty

29:15.920 --> 29:17.680
and then you're going to get yourself into

29:18.320 --> 29:19.760
what they call the landlubber

29:19.760 --> 29:25.040
and you're going to wash it down with a forest cake.

29:25.040 --> 29:25.600
With a black forest cake.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.040
Couldn't think of a fun name.

29:27.040 --> 29:27.840
Couldn't do it.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.040
Think of a good name for it.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.000
Well, it's already got-

29:30.000 --> 29:31.600
With a fudgy boy.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.080
Sorry, I got a biome in it already.

29:34.080 --> 29:34.800
You know what I mean?

29:34.800 --> 29:35.200
Yeah.

29:35.200 --> 29:35.440
Yeah.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.760
With a wooden boy.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.000
Don't think a wooden, a nice Pinocchio.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.520
My boyfriend and I went to Publix the other day.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.160
Brag.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.120
I decided, yeah.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.560
Yeah, I decided to bring my tote to save on some plastic

29:50.560 --> 29:52.800
since I didn't have a lot of groceries to buy.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.120
After my boyfriend finished his groceries,

29:55.120 --> 29:57.280
I put my tote bag in the bagging area

29:57.280 --> 29:58.560
to catch your notice and said,

29:58.560 --> 30:00.000
oh, thank you for being so considerate

30:00.000 --> 30:01.360
and bringing your own tote bag,

30:01.360 --> 30:02.080
which was nice.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.160
But then before I could say anything,

30:04.160 --> 30:05.680
he says, I'm just kidding.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.560
I don't know how to react.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.440
So I laughed it off,

30:09.440 --> 30:10.560
but it seemed kind of weird.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.400
Is it some kind of inside joke to bring in personal bags?

30:14.400 --> 30:17.760
What the fuck?

30:17.760 --> 30:18.720
What the fuck happened to you?

30:18.720 --> 30:19.920
This is from Going Green in Georgia.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.960
In Austin, you're not allowed to,

30:23.600 --> 30:27.840
like you have to pay money for the bags at grocery store

30:28.400 --> 30:29.600
if you want groceries there.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.080
So you have to bring it,

30:32.080 --> 30:34.080
you are incentivized to bring your own bags

30:34.080 --> 30:35.440
because environment.

30:35.440 --> 30:40.400
So it seems wild for it to be a goof or a gag.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.360
I'm just kidding.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.720
Can you imagine?

30:42.720 --> 30:44.720
Can you imagine if I was really someone

30:44.720 --> 30:46.160
who cared about the environment?

30:47.840 --> 30:48.720
You don't know me,

30:48.720 --> 30:50.080
but it's extremely funny.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.280
If you do know me,

30:51.280 --> 30:52.400
you would be busting up.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.480
They call me Wasteful Wallace.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.080
It's my whole deal.

30:56.080 --> 31:00.800
Does the tote bag say something kind of goofy on it?

31:00.800 --> 31:01.680
Fuck Publix.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.920
Kroger for life, fuck Publix.

31:07.920 --> 31:11.360
Giant eagle eat Publix's dick,

31:14.240 --> 31:15.280
but in a bad way.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.320
It should be clear.

31:16.320 --> 31:19.680
Maybe it was a Mr. T ate my balls tote bag.

31:19.680 --> 31:20.180
Fuck.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.280
Thanks for bringing that in.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.200
Yeah, can't sleep clowns will eat me.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.400
My honor roll student ate your honor roll student

31:34.400 --> 31:35.600
who was a dragon.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.100
Wait.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.420
Cool, man.

31:38.420 --> 31:39.300
I love that one.

31:40.100 --> 31:40.980
That's badass.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.220
My other tote bag is a Jetta.

31:46.660 --> 31:49.380
Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons

31:49.380 --> 31:52.820
because you are crunchy and tastes good with ketchup.

31:52.820 --> 31:55.700
I saw that one and it sent me to hell for three days.

31:55.700 --> 31:59.300
I saw it in college and I still remember it to this day.

31:59.300 --> 32:03.380
And I lay down on the ground and I went into a tomb

32:03.380 --> 32:05.300
and my father woke me up after three days.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.420
He said, you're back, son.

32:07.140 --> 32:08.340
Everyone follow this guy.

32:08.340 --> 32:09.940
I'm going to get out there and do some good.

32:09.940 --> 32:10.500
Just kidding.

32:11.140 --> 32:11.860
That's wild.

32:11.860 --> 32:12.260
I was kidding.

32:12.260 --> 32:12.820
When did that happen?

32:13.540 --> 32:17.380
I've never brought a cloth bag to the store before.

32:17.380 --> 32:18.020
Oh.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.140
Then you've never lived.

32:19.780 --> 32:24.100
I do keep all the plastic bags in the,

32:24.100 --> 32:25.300
you guys remember the pie safe?

32:25.300 --> 32:26.180
Oh, sure.

32:26.180 --> 32:31.940
I still got the pie safe and I keep it full of plastic bags.

32:31.940 --> 32:38.580
Recently, the back of this came off and I fixed it

32:38.580 --> 32:40.820
because it's made of wood.

32:40.820 --> 32:42.260
I'm capable of doing so.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.020
You conquered that element.

32:44.020 --> 32:46.100
And then I was stuffing the bags back in

32:46.740 --> 32:52.100
and I found one from Kroger and it had an anniversary on it.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.060
It was celebrating this anniversary of Kroger

32:55.060 --> 32:59.620
and the bag was from 2008 and I didn't know,

32:59.620 --> 33:06.180
is that still recycling or is that just me treating my home

33:06.180 --> 33:07.300
like a bag tomb?

33:09.300 --> 33:10.820
I didn't know what to do with them at that point.

33:10.820 --> 33:13.060
Justin, I think if you really stop and think about it

33:13.060 --> 33:15.060
and maybe expand that question out a bit.

33:15.060 --> 33:15.700
That's what I'm trying to do.

33:15.700 --> 33:18.500
And you said, I have some aluminum cans

33:19.140 --> 33:22.420
and what I've done is filled my basement with all of them

33:22.420 --> 33:24.020
and then closed my basement door

33:24.020 --> 33:26.020
and just don't go down there anymore.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.460
Is that recycling?

33:27.460 --> 33:30.100
I think you know the answer to that question.

33:30.100 --> 33:34.340
You could frame it like I made a shitty, uninhabitable basement.

33:34.900 --> 33:37.380
That's what I have repurposed these cans into.

33:37.380 --> 33:38.260
And guess what?

33:38.260 --> 33:38.820
It's art.

33:39.860 --> 33:43.860
Your pie safe full of garbage bags, of grocery bags,

33:43.860 --> 33:45.860
that's gonna be there until the end of time.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.260
That's art now, is what that is.

33:48.260 --> 33:48.900
That is true.

33:50.660 --> 33:53.140
But you should really start using cloth bags

33:53.140 --> 33:54.020
at the grocery store.

33:54.020 --> 33:55.460
It's pretty choice.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.940
And you can recycle those plastic bags.

33:58.580 --> 34:01.380
I don't go to the grocery store.

34:01.380 --> 34:01.700
Okay.

34:02.420 --> 34:03.940
I don't leave my house.

34:03.940 --> 34:05.620
There's a pandemic on, okay?

34:05.620 --> 34:07.300
And I think you need to start finding some things

34:07.300 --> 34:09.140
you could do with those plastic bags.

34:09.140 --> 34:12.500
Maybe make them into clothing for your children.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.580
I put them in the back of my jeans.

34:14.580 --> 34:17.620
I can fit about 30 back there and it's a nice juicy look.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.580
Oh, I see.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.060
But that's only 30.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.340
So I got the ones from,

34:22.340 --> 34:27.460
that basically gets me through like May or June of 2008.

34:27.460 --> 34:28.740
And then there's several,

34:28.740 --> 34:31.460
I mean, there's many, many, many more years to go

34:32.020 --> 34:34.020
and I don't have that much pant room.

34:34.980 --> 34:36.980
Gotta buy bigger pants, it sounds like.

34:36.980 --> 34:37.300
Yeah.

34:37.940 --> 34:38.900
Is that an answer?

34:38.900 --> 34:39.700
That'd be cool.

34:39.700 --> 34:43.140
If you had huge pants, chalk a block full of plastic bags.

34:43.140 --> 34:44.900
I could hear you coming a mile away.

34:45.860 --> 34:50.660
Fucking Jeff Jalili would have a hard time with me.

34:50.660 --> 34:51.780
Sorry, who's that?

34:54.020 --> 34:55.620
It's a guy that attacked me.

34:55.620 --> 34:56.820
Is he Kerrigan?

34:56.820 --> 34:57.700
Oh, I see.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.020
You're patting your leg.

35:00.020 --> 35:01.300
You're protecting yourself.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.660
He would take a cigarette and be like,

35:02.660 --> 35:03.460
not today, Jeff.

35:03.460 --> 35:07.300
Well, that's good because it'll save your ice skating career.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.660
I mean, you're kidding,

35:09.380 --> 35:11.140
but I like to keep my options open.

35:11.700 --> 35:11.940
Okay.

35:14.020 --> 35:16.100
I thought it was just to maybe keep the farts in.

35:16.100 --> 35:20.180
If I saw you walking down the street,

35:20.180 --> 35:23.300
your pants were huge and full of plastic bags,

35:23.300 --> 35:24.260
I'd be like, uh-oh.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.060
And I assume you've taped them at the cuffs

35:27.060 --> 35:28.660
so that the bags don't fall out.

35:30.340 --> 35:33.140
Or I think you're part of the new Borat movie

35:33.140 --> 35:35.300
and that I'm being tricked somehow.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.500
How can I, okay, thank God somebody said it.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.940
How do we keep doing a show in a world

35:41.940 --> 35:44.660
where there's a new Borat movie?

35:44.660 --> 35:46.900
I think you need to burn your soundboard, Justin.

35:46.900 --> 35:48.980
I think you need to ritualistically send it out

35:48.980 --> 35:51.140
on a boat on the river and shoot it with a firing arrow.

35:51.140 --> 35:52.580
Did you make this happen?

35:52.580 --> 35:54.500
Did I kind of bring Borat back?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.100
Interesting, interesting.

35:56.100 --> 35:59.300
Oh, quick, do some Austin Powers shit real fast.

35:59.300 --> 36:00.420
Back to back.

36:00.420 --> 36:03.060
I know, I wish.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.140
I don't have any buttons for that.

36:05.140 --> 36:07.060
You have failed me for the last time.

36:07.060 --> 36:08.420
Don't say that so quickly

36:08.420 --> 36:10.020
because right now we're about to head to the money zone.

36:10.020 --> 36:14.580
I might figure out a way to fail you there.

36:14.580 --> 36:24.900
It's time for stamps.

36:24.900 --> 36:25.940
Look at the clock.

36:25.940 --> 36:27.300
It's stamp o'clock.

36:27.300 --> 36:30.500
What the fuck, my clock actually says stamps on it.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.940
Now look at your watch.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.380
It's time for stamps.

36:33.380 --> 36:35.380
I just bought this watch.

36:35.380 --> 36:37.380
Now look at your oven timer.

36:37.380 --> 36:38.820
It's time for stamps.

36:38.820 --> 36:42.180
Oh, it's downstairs.

36:42.180 --> 36:42.680
Whoa.

36:44.100 --> 36:45.460
Also, while you're down there,

36:45.460 --> 36:46.900
take those biscuits out of the oven.

36:51.860 --> 36:52.500
No, don't eat them.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.140
They're too hot.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.380
Oh, deary.

36:57.940 --> 36:59.140
With stamps.com, you can-

36:59.140 --> 37:00.420
Can we all just shut up?

37:00.980 --> 37:02.020
I'm getting good at this.

37:04.580 --> 37:06.180
Justin, now you give him something to do.

37:06.180 --> 37:12.820
Okay, Griffin, look at the stamps in the-

37:12.820 --> 37:15.860
There's a drawer down below your feet.

37:15.860 --> 37:16.660
No, it's bats.

37:17.380 --> 37:18.260
It's made of eggs.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.780
Griffin, there's a bunch of horses that are bringing the mail.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.060
Oh no, someone shot the horse.

37:33.060 --> 37:35.700
Bang, bang.

37:35.700 --> 37:37.700
Hey, oh, Griffin, look at that.

37:37.700 --> 37:41.860
It's Richard M. Nixon, and he's about to tell us more about stamps.com.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.460
And his mouth's full of peanut butter.

37:43.460 --> 37:46.660
Oh, I didn't do any tricks on him this time.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.060
I didn't do any crimes this time.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.780
I did them last time, but not anymore.

37:51.780 --> 37:53.220
Boy, I sure am sweaty.

37:53.220 --> 37:55.060
Anyone got a big glass of water for me?

37:56.580 --> 37:57.780
With stamps.com-

37:57.780 --> 38:00.020
Can I please read this fucking ad?

38:00.020 --> 38:01.860
Yeah, I was about to do it for you,

38:01.860 --> 38:04.500
because I thought you were incapable.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.180
I didn't think you had the fortitude.

38:06.180 --> 38:08.580
No, I'm not afraid anymore, Justin.

38:08.580 --> 38:09.220
With stamps.com-

38:09.220 --> 38:09.940

39:01.060 --> 39:01.860
All one word.

39:01.860 --> 39:05.220
Do you guys remember when old Tricky Dick Nixon

39:05.220 --> 39:06.820
got kind of sweaty during a debate

39:07.780 --> 39:10.340
and then it was in every American history textbook

39:10.340 --> 39:12.180
I ever read in high school?

39:12.180 --> 39:14.340
That's a pretty fucking wild standard.

39:14.340 --> 39:16.020
That's a pretty fucking wild bar, yes.

39:16.660 --> 39:18.980
Anyway, Squarespace is a,

39:18.980 --> 39:21.380
if you want to hear more of my sort of cutting political humor,

39:22.020 --> 39:24.980
you can go to the website I created on Squarespace.

39:24.980 --> 39:26.900
It's called the Washington Post.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.100
Whoa!

39:28.100 --> 39:32.420
And yeah, so the Squarespace is sponsoring us this week

39:32.420 --> 39:35.060

40:09.220 --> 40:12.580
Bwaah, bwaah!

40:12.580 --> 40:14.500
I am not a crow!

40:14.500 --> 40:17.380
Oh, oh, Nixon's dead.

40:17.380 --> 40:18.660
I think he is actually.

40:18.660 --> 40:20.500
I think he asked away a while ago.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.660
I mean, yeah, no, he definitely did.

40:22.660 --> 40:28.260
Still miss him though.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.620
I'm gonna make a website about how much I miss Richard Nixon

40:31.620 --> 40:33.460
but I don't know how to make a website.

40:33.460 --> 40:34.740
Does that make me a coward?

40:34.740 --> 40:35.860
I don't think so.

40:35.860 --> 40:37.700
It just makes me somebody who needs a little help

40:37.700 --> 40:39.620
and that help is gonna come from Squarespace.

40:39.620 --> 40:42.980
Hey Justin, are you doing the Squarespace ad again?

40:43.540 --> 40:46.020
Listen, we just did.

40:46.020 --> 40:48.820
We literally just did it.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.180
Hey J-Man, are you cool?

40:50.180 --> 40:51.380
What about stance.com?

40:51.380 --> 40:51.940
Yeah, we did it.

40:51.940 --> 40:53.060
All right, I'll do stance.com.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.740
We did stance too.

40:54.740 --> 40:55.300
Partner.

40:56.660 --> 40:58.180
Macho Man to the top rope.

40:59.220 --> 41:00.420
The flying elbow.

41:00.420 --> 41:00.980
The cover.

41:03.940 --> 41:06.020
We've got a new champion.

41:08.420 --> 41:10.260
We're here with Macho Man Randy Savage

41:10.260 --> 41:13.060
after his big win to become the new world champion.

41:13.060 --> 41:14.820
What are you gonna do now, Mach?

41:14.820 --> 41:17.060
I'm gonna go listen to the newest episode

41:17.060 --> 41:18.980
of the Titans and Fights podcast.

41:18.980 --> 41:19.780
Oh yeah.

41:19.780 --> 41:21.540
Tell us more about this podcast.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.060
It's the podcast of power.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.420
Too sweet to be sour.

41:24.420 --> 41:26.020
Funky like a monkey.

41:26.020 --> 41:27.620
Woke discussions, man.

41:27.620 --> 41:30.660
And jokes about wrestlers fashion choices.

41:30.660 --> 41:32.900
Myself excluded, yeah.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.340
I can't wait to listen.

41:34.340 --> 41:35.460
Neither can I.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.580
You can find it Saturdays on Maximum Fun.

41:38.580 --> 41:40.340
Oh yeah, dig it.

41:42.820 --> 41:46.740
688 people wanted to use the teeth.

41:47.300 --> 41:47.800
Wow.

41:47.800 --> 41:53.720
So we have in Gmail, if you look at the tag we created

41:53.720 --> 41:55.000
called they will use the teeth.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.560
It says one out of a hundred of many.

41:59.560 --> 42:02.680
It won't even tell me exactly how many emails

42:03.400 --> 42:06.760
fit this thing that they could use the teeth.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.400
Have we gotten any since we started recording?

42:09.400 --> 42:10.840
Just so I know like how fast.

42:10.840 --> 42:14.360
Most recent was at 1150 this morning.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.120
It is 325 as we were recording it.

42:16.120 --> 42:16.760
It's been four hours.

42:16.760 --> 42:20.760
Okay, I mean you're just gonna give us the highlight.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.560
We can't read possibly 600 entries into this.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.320
Okay, okay, tough guy.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.280
But think of what you're saying.

42:26.280 --> 42:27.800
If you want me to give you the highlights,

42:27.800 --> 42:30.680
that would require me reading 688 entries.

42:30.680 --> 42:31.560
And we can't do that.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.720
We've all agreed that that's impossible, right?

42:33.720 --> 42:35.560
How many of you read, Justin?

42:35.560 --> 42:36.840
Yeah, so here's one.

42:37.560 --> 42:38.520
I'm just gonna start.

42:38.520 --> 42:41.000
I wanna do kind of like lightning round.

42:41.000 --> 42:41.560
Okay.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.840
So if you want to at any point veto,

42:44.840 --> 42:46.120
I'll just go to the next person.

42:46.120 --> 42:46.600
Okay.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.160
At any point, I'm giving you guys the ability

42:49.160 --> 42:50.040
to like bail on it.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.240
Sounds good.

42:51.240 --> 42:52.040
From Laura.

42:52.040 --> 42:53.160
When I heard about the teeth,

42:53.160 --> 42:55.000
I came up with a fun and creepy design

42:55.000 --> 42:56.200
for a tooth fairy costume.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.200
I would cast the teeth

42:58.200 --> 43:00.040
so I'd be able to make duplicates if needed.

43:00.040 --> 43:00.840
For the real teeth,

43:00.840 --> 43:03.240
I would make a halo crown style headband

43:03.240 --> 43:04.600
and attach them at the end of spikes.

43:04.600 --> 43:05.000
I'm out.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.600
That's pretty fucked up.

43:07.640 --> 43:09.320
I mean, it's very fucked up.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.480
But I have a feeling all of these will be.

43:11.480 --> 43:18.120
Um, so I'll use the teeth for a wooden back scratcher

43:18.120 --> 43:18.520
where the teeth.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.000
I'm out.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.840
Next, next, next, next.

43:20.840 --> 43:21.160
Nope.

43:21.960 --> 43:23.640
I will use the teeth.

43:23.640 --> 43:24.280
I love this one.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.240
I will use the teeth.

43:25.240 --> 43:26.200
I read this one.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.760
I have started making my own container candles,

43:28.760 --> 43:31.160
usually in recycled jars and through store coffee mugs.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.080
When making candles as gifts,

43:33.080 --> 43:35.560
I've added costume jewelry during the process

43:35.560 --> 43:37.640
so my friends and family can have a fun surprise

43:37.640 --> 43:39.080
when all the wax is melted away.

43:39.080 --> 43:39.480
Yes.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.400
I would use the teeth to add to a candle.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.800
Or maybe I would add each tooth to a different candle.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.520
It may not be a fun surprise when all the wax melts away,

43:46.520 --> 43:48.520
but it would definitely be some kind of surprise.

43:48.520 --> 43:52.760
It'd be fun for me, fun for me to know now

43:52.760 --> 43:54.600
that somebody is going to be melting a candle

43:54.600 --> 43:58.280
trying to relax or maybe creating a sexual environment.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.800
And then, hey, why is there?

43:59.800 --> 44:05.400
Hey, um, Debra, why is there a fucking tooth just like out?

44:05.400 --> 44:06.920
On, who did that come from?

44:07.480 --> 44:08.440
I'm going to say no to this

44:08.440 --> 44:10.200
because I think the wax would compromise the teeth.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.320
I think that's right.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.360
Interesting, interesting.

44:12.360 --> 44:16.840
Tyler works at a company

44:16.840 --> 44:18.920
that does like larping and stuff in summer camps.

44:18.920 --> 44:19.560
Uh-huh.

44:19.560 --> 44:25.720
And Tyler makes the swords out of like paper mache swords.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.600
And he said, I would load nothing more in the paper mache,

44:28.600 --> 44:31.560
these chompers, perhaps into a snake's head or a skull

44:31.560 --> 44:33.320
on the hill of a pommel or a sword.

44:33.320 --> 44:37.000
Okay, hey Tyler, my dude, this is great.

44:37.000 --> 44:42.360
If I saw a snake's head with some human molars crafted in them,

44:42.360 --> 44:45.320
I think that might be the goofiest shit in the world.

44:45.960 --> 44:46.920
It calls apart here.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.520
Tyler says, once complete,

44:48.520 --> 44:51.000
I will send this sword to you, Justin McElroy.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.440
You fucked up, Tyler.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.920
We made it very clear we don't want the teeth.

44:54.920 --> 44:56.760
I never want to encounter the teeth.

44:56.760 --> 45:01.400
But everyone should picture snakes with molars instead of fangs.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.320
I am reading one here from Zoe who says,

45:03.320 --> 45:05.400
I'm an art student and would love to use the teeth in a piece.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.520
I promise I'll make it nice.

45:06.520 --> 45:07.800
I listen to y'all so much while I paint

45:07.800 --> 45:10.360
and I would love to add even more of your essence to my practice.

45:11.480 --> 45:15.560
There's no specifics here, which is my first big red flag.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.000
The other one is that,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
and we should have maybe made this clear the first time,

45:19.000 --> 45:22.600
and I thought it was, we're not giving our own teeth away.

45:23.640 --> 45:27.320
Like, I'm still wicked using mine a lot.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.000
I'm wild about it.

45:29.000 --> 45:29.960
Love these babies.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.960
And you know, I will also say,

45:31.960 --> 45:35.080
and this is kind of like a little bit of like job training,

45:35.080 --> 45:36.440
like a job interview training,

45:37.480 --> 45:40.440
a word to avoid when you're trying to get something

45:40.440 --> 45:42.120
from someone you like is essence.

45:43.720 --> 45:45.560
I will use your essence.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.720
Makes me think of like in Hocus Pocus

45:47.720 --> 45:50.040
when the witches are stealing the children's youth.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.400
Matty said, I would like to put the wisdom teeth in a dice mold

45:53.400 --> 45:56.760
and make T&D dice out of them for wisdom saving rolls.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.200
Oh, that's good.

45:58.200 --> 45:59.240
That's very good.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.040
It's good, but not everybody's going to enjoy that.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.320
Well, not everyone likes art.

46:03.320 --> 46:07.080
No, but I mean, but you could go see the art if you want to.

46:07.720 --> 46:08.280
You know what I mean?

46:08.280 --> 46:09.080
It'll be on display.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.280
It belongs in a museum.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.160
I guess is what I'm saying.

46:11.160 --> 46:13.240
The teeth belong in a museum.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.720
Jillian wants to make tooth earrings.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.640
That's okay.

46:20.520 --> 46:23.000
See, I'm also kind of avoiding people.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.040
We heard from a lot of people who collect teeth

46:28.040 --> 46:29.400
and have a lot of teeth.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.920
You have enough teeth already.

46:30.920 --> 46:31.400
You have enough teeth.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.360
Don't be greedy.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.440
I'm seeing a lot of people saying,

46:34.440 --> 46:37.960
I have a bird house that I have that I've been looking to spice.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.400
Here's somebody who says they have a lamp

46:41.400 --> 46:43.640
that they've been looking to spice up for a while.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.960
I feel like a lot of people are just looking at shit

46:45.960 --> 46:48.360
and saying, you know what would make this spicy is teeth.

46:48.360 --> 46:52.120
I want something a little bit more purposeful than that.

46:52.120 --> 46:53.640
Little more thought through.

46:55.080 --> 46:58.040
My plan for the teeth would most likely involve

46:58.040 --> 47:00.680
teeth emerging from the eye socket of a crawling human.

47:00.680 --> 47:02.360
Next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.240
I don't think so.

47:03.240 --> 47:04.120
I don't think we can do this.

47:04.120 --> 47:04.600
Well, hold on.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.160
What standard are we holding this art to?

47:08.280 --> 47:12.280
Does it have to be objectively not creepy tooth art?

47:12.280 --> 47:14.280
Because we may not find that.

47:14.280 --> 47:17.000
Okay, I have one here from Felix.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.720
I am a self-employed jeweler and craftsman

47:19.720 --> 47:22.280
who specializes in weird and interesting material.

47:22.280 --> 47:25.640
I've previously made a wooden ring with a wallaby tooth inset

47:25.640 --> 47:27.640
that I found on a bushwalk.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.920
And I have a good range of brooches, pendants,

47:30.920 --> 47:32.920
knife handles, and rings made of bone.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.800
While I have, as above mentioned,

47:35.800 --> 47:38.440
practiced some post-mortem wallaby dentistry,

47:38.440 --> 47:41.000
I would absolutely love to be able to make some jewelry

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
with real human teeth.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.480
Who can say what I would make?

47:45.480 --> 47:49.000
Okay, Felix, who can say what I would make?

47:49.000 --> 47:49.560
You can.

47:50.520 --> 47:51.800
Yeah, you can right there.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.320
That was your moment to do that.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.960
Oh, now Felix does suggest perhaps

47:55.960 --> 47:57.720
a matching pair of wedding rings.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.160
You can suggest anything.

48:01.800 --> 48:04.280
There's one here from Greta who says that

48:04.280 --> 48:08.040
they made three of their own wisdom teeth into rings,

48:08.040 --> 48:11.240
but the fourth one cracked in half, so they couldn't do it.

48:11.240 --> 48:15.240
So it would be, can we just send one Greta's way

48:15.240 --> 48:17.320
so they can like complete the set?

48:17.320 --> 48:18.440
Oh, that is a good question.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.040
Are we doing, is this an all or nothing?

48:20.680 --> 48:22.600
I think it's gotta be an all or nothing.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.000
Yeah, I'm not arranging, I'm not paying for shipping

48:25.000 --> 48:26.120
to several different people.

48:26.120 --> 48:29.000
Marla said, I hope I'm not too late in responding.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.160
I would like to use the teeth in the Christmas diorama.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.200
And there's an attached concept photo here.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.600
Send that, drop that for me in our Slack, please,

48:36.600 --> 48:38.040
so I can look at that, please, now.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.080
All right, let me just pass this along to you guys.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.040
I would love to see this.

48:42.840 --> 48:45.800
Gonna pass this along and I'll let, I mean,

48:45.800 --> 48:52.600
either one of you guys can describe what you're seeing here.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.080
I'll just pass this along real quick.

48:55.080 --> 49:02.040
Oh, huh, well, I like that it's non-secular,

49:02.040 --> 49:03.560
or secular, it's secular.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.080
Non-religious.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.040
Non-religious, thank you.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.400
That would be the way I'd put it.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.800
Well, one of the teeth is an angel, though.

49:09.800 --> 49:10.680
Does that count?

49:12.520 --> 49:16.120
We're trending towards religion with that one.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.440
Yeah, I mean, it's just a winter wonderland scene

49:18.440 --> 49:20.120
with a reindeer and Santa Claus,

49:20.120 --> 49:22.840
and it does look like most of these things

49:22.840 --> 49:26.680
were maybe store-bought and placed inside of a panorama,

49:26.680 --> 49:29.720
or a diorama, and then they have little clay teeth

49:29.720 --> 49:31.560
on everything, I don't know.

49:31.560 --> 49:32.120
I was imagining that.

49:32.120 --> 49:35.160
I see the problem I have with this, with, I love it, Marla,

49:35.160 --> 49:36.040
I love your work.

49:36.040 --> 49:39.080
The teeth in the model are much bigger

49:39.080 --> 49:40.120
than the teeth would be.

49:40.680 --> 49:43.000
And that makes me feel like you don't actually appreciate

49:43.800 --> 49:45.080
your materials that you're working with.

49:45.080 --> 49:46.040
That's a good point, Justin.

49:46.040 --> 49:48.680
Like, that worries me.

49:48.680 --> 49:49.880
I don't want you to get the teeth and be like,

49:49.880 --> 49:51.480
these are so fucking small.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.680
I can't do anything with them.

49:53.720 --> 49:55.480
Now, here's an interesting one.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.160
I will use the teeth.

49:59.160 --> 50:02.840
I am a knitwear designer who spins my own yarn.

50:02.840 --> 50:04.760
Where could this be going, you're wondering.

50:04.760 --> 50:07.640
I would make the teeth into some stitch markers

50:07.640 --> 50:10.520
for my knitting work by wire wrapping them

50:10.520 --> 50:12.840
and attaching them to some bulb safety pins

50:12.840 --> 50:14.920
so I can use them to mark where I'm knitting.

50:14.920 --> 50:20.360
How do we feel about someone using them to create art

50:20.360 --> 50:22.520
but not using them in the art itself?

50:23.720 --> 50:24.600
It seems like a cheat.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.960
Hey fam, you sure have sent in some pretty

50:28.520 --> 50:30.760
accursed JPEGs our way.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.120
And I do thank you for that.

50:32.120 --> 50:35.560
I am just sort of scrobbling here through the old tag

50:35.560 --> 50:37.560
and there's a lot of upsetting imagery.

50:38.840 --> 50:40.520
A lot of upsetting imagery.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.000
Again, though, what did we expect?

50:43.000 --> 50:46.120
Hmm, I would use them to make brass knuckles.

50:47.480 --> 50:48.600
Okay.

50:48.600 --> 50:51.720
Right, punch and bite with one swing, hold on.

50:51.720 --> 50:52.600
Wait a minute.

50:52.600 --> 50:55.720
Frankly, I would never have to use them

50:55.720 --> 50:58.760
because people would back the fuck up just seeing them.

50:59.400 --> 51:00.600
Whoa, okay.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.240
Whoa, this is, okay, hold on.

51:03.240 --> 51:05.880
We're talking at this point about sort of like

51:05.880 --> 51:08.600
nuclear deterrence of just like,

51:08.600 --> 51:12.280
this thing looks incredibly violent, the punch biter.

51:12.280 --> 51:14.360
But it could also add rhinestones

51:14.360 --> 51:17.640
to the sides of the brass knuckles, but that's optional.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.560
The real stars here are the teeth.

51:20.120 --> 51:20.840
Don't do it.

51:20.840 --> 51:23.800
I'm saying if you pull out brass knuckles with teeth on them,

51:23.800 --> 51:25.400
the fight will be stopped

51:25.400 --> 51:27.800
because nobody will wanna mess with you.

51:27.800 --> 51:30.520
So this may be an incredible peacekeeping tool.

51:30.520 --> 51:31.640
That's up there for me.

51:32.440 --> 51:33.720
Okay, okay.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.920
I would like to use the teeth for a mouth mug.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.960
I am planning on sculpting a mug

51:39.960 --> 51:42.760
to look like a realistic mouth.

51:42.760 --> 51:45.720
And the teeth would be a great addition

51:45.720 --> 51:47.160
to make it look realistic.

51:47.160 --> 51:50.200
Now I'm assuming that what we're picturing here

51:50.200 --> 51:52.440
is the top of the mug is a mouth,

51:52.440 --> 51:54.520
not that the mouth is on the side,

51:54.520 --> 51:57.320
but rather you would be drinking out of the mouth.

51:58.600 --> 51:59.960
Okay, hold on.

51:59.960 --> 52:02.200
You're talking about a mouth cup.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.480
How many wisdom, it's all wisdom teeth.

52:05.480 --> 52:07.560
I'm now trying to imagine a mouth

52:07.560 --> 52:09.720
made up entirely of wisdom teeth.

52:09.720 --> 52:10.680
And it's only four.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.760
Bookmark that one.

52:12.760 --> 52:13.480
Bookmark that one.

52:13.480 --> 52:14.360
That one sounds good.

52:14.360 --> 52:15.320
I really like tooth mug.

52:16.360 --> 52:18.840
Molly, this is the entirety of Molly's email.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.520
Okay, so you're familiar with Georgia O'Keeffe, right?

52:22.520 --> 52:23.320
Huh?

52:23.320 --> 52:28.200
That's the whole thing.

52:28.200 --> 52:30.200
I mean, if they had ended that email with,

52:30.200 --> 52:31.960
let me hit you with this, Georgia O'Keeffe,

52:32.840 --> 52:34.200
then we could have been somewhere.

52:34.200 --> 52:35.800
Allison says, I will dissolve the teeth

52:35.800 --> 52:37.720
in a jar of Coca-Cola on a time-lapse video

52:37.720 --> 52:40.360
as a commentary on the bourgeoisie.

52:40.360 --> 52:41.800
Okay, that's bold.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.920
I like how the teeth art don't exist anymore afterwards.

52:46.440 --> 52:53.440
Some of these emails, like, whoa, this one's really a lot.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.080
Hold on a second.

52:55.080 --> 52:55.800
Hold on.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.000
Guys, look at this one.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.160
I think this is what I want to use the teeth for.

52:59.160 --> 52:59.660
Whoa.

53:00.520 --> 53:02.840
There's so much great art in the world

53:02.840 --> 53:04.520
and it makes you kind of weep.

53:04.520 --> 53:07.640
I feel like, you know in American Beauty

53:07.640 --> 53:11.640
when Wes Craven sees the plastic bag flitting around?

53:11.640 --> 53:13.880
I feel like that right now.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.640
That bag's pretty cool though, huh?

53:15.640 --> 53:17.960
It fell out of his mother's pie safe.

53:17.960 --> 53:18.840
Oh boy.

53:18.840 --> 53:19.400
Whoa, hey.

53:22.200 --> 53:22.760
Oh yeah.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.760
The problem, Justin, is that this is impossible

53:26.760 --> 53:28.360
to describe on our podcast.

53:28.360 --> 53:29.880
But oh yeah, I'm with you.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.680
This is art.

53:32.680 --> 53:33.560
That's art right there.

53:33.560 --> 53:35.480
If I saw that in a building, I would say,

53:35.480 --> 53:36.760
where did you get this art from?

53:37.800 --> 53:41.720
It's two sort of pseudo busts

53:41.720 --> 53:44.680
made out of what looks like reclaimed materials,

53:44.680 --> 53:48.520
like rocks and wire mesh with like,

53:48.520 --> 53:51.160
I don't know, man, fishing tackle and wire.

53:51.160 --> 53:52.200
Yeah, here's what I love.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.440
These sculptures that we're looking at

53:54.440 --> 53:56.360
are definitely in a museum.

53:56.360 --> 53:57.560
Yeah, yeah.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.680
And they're definitely art.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.480
Now, can we be sure that this is not a person

54:01.480 --> 54:03.960
who just took a picture of some shit in a museum?

54:03.960 --> 54:05.800
Because I do not want you to just run up

54:05.800 --> 54:09.800
to some shit in a museum and slap illegal teeth on them.

54:10.680 --> 54:17.480
Yes, because I'm looking at Taylor Baldwin's website

54:17.480 --> 54:19.240
and there's a lot of art on here.

54:19.240 --> 54:20.440
I love that.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.960
Somebody who makes so much art.

54:22.760 --> 54:23.800
It's good too.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.640
I love this art and I'm crazy about it.

54:26.280 --> 54:29.400
If y'all go to taylorbaldwinstudio.com,

54:29.400 --> 54:31.720
you can see more of Taylor's work.

54:31.720 --> 54:34.200
I think this is somebody who's talented,

54:34.200 --> 54:37.560
deserves our patronage and would use the teeth.

54:37.560 --> 54:38.600
They will use the teeth.

54:39.160 --> 54:40.280
They will use the teeth.

54:40.280 --> 54:42.120
I'm looking at this right now, they've used everything.

54:42.120 --> 54:44.280
Yeah, they will use the teeth.

54:44.280 --> 54:45.960
I'm for it, I'm here for it.

54:46.600 --> 54:48.280
Okay, now I don't know if we have heard back

54:48.280 --> 54:50.280
from the person who has the teeth.

54:50.280 --> 54:51.240
That is one thing.

54:51.240 --> 54:54.360
Oh, so the question is, will we use the teeth?

54:55.080 --> 54:56.440
Will we get the teeth?

54:56.440 --> 54:59.880
Will we pass along the teeth?

54:59.880 --> 55:01.960
Okay, but now we're in danger of other people saying like,

55:01.960 --> 55:03.480
oh, well, I feel bad for them.

55:03.480 --> 55:04.760
I'll send them some teeth.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.400
No, we said one time deal.

55:07.400 --> 55:10.360
We are black market traders of chompers.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.160
One time.

55:14.200 --> 55:17.080
So maybe Taylor should set up a PO box

55:18.120 --> 55:22.120
where people can just send some teeth if they run into it.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.480
Oh, I don't know.

55:23.480 --> 55:25.560
I think that that will have to be up to Taylor.

55:25.560 --> 55:26.680
No pressure, Taylor.

55:27.720 --> 55:28.600
No pressure, Taylor.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.320
However many teeth you got in there, just-

55:31.320 --> 55:32.600
Here's what we do, Justin.

55:33.400 --> 55:35.880
We get a PO box.

55:35.880 --> 55:37.560
We prepay it for a year

55:38.200 --> 55:41.240
and then people could send as many teeth to it as they want.

55:41.240 --> 55:41.560
No, no, no, no, no.

55:41.560 --> 55:42.200
No, hear me out.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.480
And then we stop paying for it.

55:45.480 --> 55:45.960
No, no, no, no, no, no.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.400
Nopey, nopey, nopey, nopey, nopey, nopey.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.320
I actually liked the second half of that pretty good.

55:51.880 --> 55:53.240
We're gonna make this happen.

55:53.240 --> 55:58.440
The ideal outcome to me is that this work ends up in a museum

55:58.440 --> 56:01.000
and then there's a little plaque there that's like,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.400
spooky boys, and then it'll say like,

56:03.400 --> 56:08.440
clay, reclaimed stone, four real teeth from podcast jokes.

56:08.440 --> 56:08.940
Yeah.

56:09.880 --> 56:11.560
That would be pretty badass to me.

56:13.000 --> 56:13.720
Yeah.

56:13.720 --> 56:15.880
I think that would really save 2020.

56:16.840 --> 56:19.800
We'd have to really ask Taylor to like make the art so good though

56:19.800 --> 56:24.360
that it ends up in like Louvre or other big art museums.

56:24.360 --> 56:25.560
Met, Met's one.

56:25.560 --> 56:27.400
Met, oh, the Met.

56:28.200 --> 56:31.080
Or the Natural History Museum that's right by,

56:31.720 --> 56:34.440
you know, the Central Park, that's one.

56:35.160 --> 56:36.040
Sure.

56:36.040 --> 56:36.680
And okay.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.600
Teeth are natural history if you think about it.

56:39.880 --> 56:43.000
Stratford Cash in St. Paul has gotten back to us.

56:43.720 --> 56:45.240
I do have the Venmo.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.680
I'm sending the cash now.

56:46.680 --> 56:48.040
Okay, so you're buying teeth.

56:48.040 --> 56:51.400
Taylor, I need to hear from you to get a mailing address

56:51.400 --> 56:52.680
so we can facilitate this.

56:52.680 --> 56:53.160
Nice.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.680
Did I buy them for a hundred dollars?

56:54.680 --> 56:55.320
Is that what I did?

56:55.320 --> 56:56.040
Jeez.

56:56.040 --> 56:56.840
Yeah?

56:56.840 --> 56:57.640
Sounds right.

56:58.200 --> 56:58.920
Sounds like me.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.160
Sounds like something I'd do.

57:02.440 --> 57:03.240
Oh boy.

57:03.240 --> 57:04.840
All right, I'm paying out right now.

57:06.040 --> 57:07.080
Stratford Cash.

57:08.840 --> 57:11.960
I'm gonna make this particular transaction up.

57:13.640 --> 57:15.240
From the Lord.

57:15.240 --> 57:15.740
Lord.

57:17.880 --> 57:19.640
Don't need to make this public.

57:19.640 --> 57:23.400
Can I ask what emoji, what you put in the details field?

57:23.400 --> 57:23.880
Teeth.

57:23.880 --> 57:24.200
Teeth.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.320
You just wrote the word teeth.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.680
You didn't even put a teeth emoji.

57:28.920 --> 57:36.520
For those teeth.

57:36.520 --> 57:37.020
Nice.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.280
Oh, and there's a little, they make, they got a little,

57:40.280 --> 57:45.880
they got a little brushing emoji.

57:45.880 --> 57:46.360
That's so cute.

57:46.360 --> 57:46.920
That's good.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.920
Because if anybody does hack your shit and see that,

57:48.920 --> 57:51.000
they'll think you've just gone to some sort of like

57:51.000 --> 57:54.120
independent underground dentist for criminals.

57:54.120 --> 57:54.760
Yeah.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.760
For the teeth, which I hope you still have.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.080
Address forthcoming.

57:59.720 --> 58:00.280
Lylas.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.060
Justin.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.520
Okay, this money has been sent.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.520
The gears are turning, Taylor Baldwin.

58:10.520 --> 58:14.040
It all depends on you for you to use the teeth.

58:14.040 --> 58:16.200
And nobody else send us submissions.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.560
Nobody else, please.

58:18.200 --> 58:19.160
Please.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.240
We can't help you.

58:22.520 --> 58:24.440
