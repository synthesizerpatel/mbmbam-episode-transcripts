00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.520
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother and my brother's main advice show for the modern era.

00:47.520 --> 00:55.680
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis.

00:55.680 --> 01:01.840
I need you guys to keep in mind that I edit the podcast, and when you introduce these just

01:01.840 --> 01:06.240
delicious delectable pauses, it's hell. It is hell on earth.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.680
But it's fun for people at home because they get anticipation tingles.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.760
They don't get anticipation, they don't get ASMR,

01:11.760 --> 01:13.680
they've listened to 500 fucking episodes of this.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.560
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.520
I'm building off of what we have said already about this, so you can't remove it from the show.

01:21.520 --> 01:21.920
Okay.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.760
This is- Griffin, do your thing, baby.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.560
Everyone, I want you to meet my youngest brother.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.000
Oh boy, howdy. It'll be really confusing,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.600
because that sentence is going to sound really normal once I do my sick stuff to it.

01:39.440 --> 01:39.920
Okay.

01:39.920 --> 01:42.160
Oh shit, oh my god.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.080
Can you say your name?

01:46.080 --> 01:47.520
This is Griffin McElroy.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.640
Can I tell y'all something?

01:48.640 --> 01:49.600
Mm-hmm.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.920
Something I just found out looking up, listen.

01:51.920 --> 01:52.880
What was that?

01:52.880 --> 01:56.080
We're recording this on the 3rd, so this is topical when I say it.

01:56.080 --> 02:01.040
Of course, of course, the 4th of July in the United States is in Penis Day.

02:01.600 --> 02:05.760
Now it is also National Barbecued Spare Ribs Day.

02:06.640 --> 02:06.800
Yeah.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.160
It's okay, cool.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.040
It's also National Caesar Salad Day.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.800
Well, that's for the spare ribs.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.760
It's a foil to the spare ribs people.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.040
That was the one actually organized by Caesar Salads,

02:19.040 --> 02:22.480
because for a day they could just fucking relax.

02:22.480 --> 02:22.800
Yeah.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.040
Because nobody's going to come eat one of them.

02:25.040 --> 02:25.840
Not that day.

02:25.840 --> 02:26.160
No.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.160
No one's eating the Caesar Salad.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.400
And if you have been tempted in this, the year of our Lord,

02:32.400 --> 02:37.440
to tweet at me a picture of the grody Caesar Salad that you ate on the 4th of July,

02:37.440 --> 02:38.880
I am not interested.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.160
No, no, don't do it.

02:42.160 --> 02:42.720
No.

02:42.720 --> 02:42.880
No.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.520
Wait a minute, is that the stinky salad?

02:45.520 --> 02:46.800
Because I think it is.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.640
The one with chokes?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.240
You got the stinky salad going?

02:51.120 --> 02:52.880
I mean, I don't want to...

02:52.880 --> 02:57.120
Throw your hot dog eating contest in the garbage can.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.040
Pick up Joey Chestnut from the armpits,

03:01.040 --> 03:03.520
lift him into the big garbage can, and release him.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.360
Squeeze gently, because he's full of wet buds.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.160
But do place him in the garbage can,

03:10.160 --> 03:13.440
because I want to have that Caesar Salad eating contest.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.240
To celebrate the birth of the Statue of Liberty

03:16.240 --> 03:21.440
from the womb of independence from those mean Europe ones.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.440
I mean, it's all one, right?

03:23.440 --> 03:24.720
It's just one.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.120
It's just everybody at the table does one,

03:27.120 --> 03:28.800
and then they go home as friends.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.200
Is it the biggest salad or the most salad?

03:33.200 --> 03:37.440
I think that you make a bet on the weight of salad you can consume.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.960
And then it's like whoever gets closest without going over kind of deal.

03:43.520 --> 03:43.840
Yeah.

03:43.840 --> 03:48.400
Now you would have to not weigh, like you couldn't have a weight running during it, right?

03:48.400 --> 03:52.560
You'd have to say like, I think I will eat 10 pounds of salad, right?

03:52.560 --> 03:54.320
And then you just start eating.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.840
And then you say, and I'm done.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.080
I think that was 10 pounds.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.520
And make it about guessing how close you can get to the weight that you said.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.720
I am getting really excited about this.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.960
This year's eating competition is going to be huge.

04:08.960 --> 04:14.000
The exact same people win every year.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.680
So it's thrilling for me.

04:15.680 --> 04:20.880
The same man has won the men's competition every year since 2007.

04:20.880 --> 04:26.720
Of course, Chestnut who sort of took the torch from Kobayashi after it was his turn to win.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.520
When he exploded.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.880
He exploded like Mr. Creasel.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.720
And then and now it's Joey's turn.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.400
And one day he'll explode and I'll step in.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.680
2015, sorry.

04:41.680 --> 04:47.440
I want to give credit to Matt Stoney who bested Joe in 2015.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.320
But that's been it.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.560
It's been pretty uneventful since then.

04:51.840 --> 05:03.600
This year, Joey is going to be looking to top a record 74 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

05:03.600 --> 05:11.120
If you guys had to take on Joey and bring him, take him, take him down, take him out.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.720
What would be your strategy?

05:12.720 --> 05:16.240
Oh, I think you're going to say how many hot dogs do I think I could consume in 10 minutes.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.560
Because I think my strategy would be to tap out really early.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.400
Oh, interesting.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.360
So not eat as many as you can.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.280
And I have stuff to do on the 5th.

05:27.280 --> 05:33.360
I would argue that Joey's got stuff to do on the 5th.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.920
I would guess Joey keeps a clear calendar on the 5th.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.480
He's got a clear calendar and a clear path to the bathroom.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.480
He's got a completely just non-existent Google calendar.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.720
I would say from the 5th to the 12th.

05:52.240 --> 05:56.000
He's got Clippy like I see you're trying to schedule something on the 6th.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.040
Are you sure?

05:57.040 --> 06:03.280
He's got his iPad plugged into the charger in the bathroom.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.200
Netflix ready to roll, baby.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.840
He probably already has Shazam downloaded.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.000
He's ready to watch Shazam, yeah.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.360
He's ready to fire it up.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.560
Poop all day, I mean.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.080
Hey, can I ask you guys a question?

06:18.080 --> 06:20.080
It's the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.

06:22.240 --> 06:22.480
What?

06:22.480 --> 06:23.200
You're the worst.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.320
What's funny about that?

06:24.320 --> 06:25.680
You're thinking about his big poopy?

06:25.680 --> 06:26.960
The whole thing.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.200
The whole thing is the worst.

06:29.200 --> 06:34.000
So Nathan likes to make people hurt and so obviously Nathan loves this.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.520
Nathan loves watching Joey Chestnut and his weird bad throat just destroy all these dogs,

06:39.520 --> 06:40.080
right?

06:40.080 --> 06:43.200
And everybody gets so excited from Nathan's when they see this and they celebrate the

06:43.200 --> 06:48.560
nation's independence when they watch a man eat 74 hot dogs, which is terrible.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.920
In 10 minutes.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.600
In 10 minutes, but let me ask this.

06:51.600 --> 06:59.680
Do you think the company that makes the buns is as psyched to watch their creation get

07:00.400 --> 07:05.840
besoiled in a big nasty cup of grime and then slurped down?

07:05.840 --> 07:09.840
That's not even a gnarly enough onomatopoetic sort of creation.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.400
Slurped.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.440
It gets slurped down the throat.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.840
I bet you the bun makers are like, ah, fuck.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.200
That's not good promotion.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.640
No one's gonna see that and be like, you know what?

07:18.640 --> 07:22.000
I could go out and eat some regular hot dog buns with nothing on them.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.280
Well, that's the thing.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.200
I think maybe this will be the end.

07:25.200 --> 07:30.960
This is my side bet for the hot dog that Nathan's goes, hey, you know what?

07:30.960 --> 07:36.080
This might be the least advertising way to try to advertise our product.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.200
The least.

07:37.200 --> 07:43.360
It's like if they were trying to fucking advertise Shazam by showing a movie theater where they

07:43.360 --> 07:49.200
have locked in 100 people for four straight days watching nothing but Shazam and then

07:49.200 --> 07:50.240
they walk out of the theaters.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.920
I want to hear what their review is.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.760
That's the thing.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.800
So that's it.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.960
Hey, if I was Nathan's, you know what the hot dog eating contest I would propose is?

07:58.960 --> 08:04.880
Watch somebody eat one hot dog for 10 minutes and try to act like they're enjoying it as

08:04.880 --> 08:08.720
much as possible and then judge you won by a round of applause.

08:09.280 --> 08:09.760
Yeah.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.880
Who most artistically savors a hot dog for 10 minutes?

08:12.880 --> 08:13.440
Yes.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.800
Who can dress it with the best condiments?

08:16.800 --> 08:19.840
Who can savor it the most?

08:19.840 --> 08:26.400
And who had the most orgasmic enjoyment of a single Nathan's hot dog?

08:26.400 --> 08:32.240
No, if you moan in the daytime Fourth of July contest, you are out.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.000
You save that for Nathan's after dark.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.640
Nathan's after dark, we can get pretty raunchy on these dogs and these buns.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.400
I'll have what he's having.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.360
And that's my secret.

08:41.360 --> 08:45.120
A lot of people focus on dog-based sexual humor.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.240
Let's talk about that bun though.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.000
Lots of opportunities for Nathan's after dark though.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.760
Don't get kicked out of the daytime.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.680
It's kind of like a butt in some ways.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.480
You could say that.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.240
A butt or a fanny or whatever.

08:56.240 --> 09:02.800
Do you guys know that there is another title held by Joey Chestnut?

09:03.600 --> 09:04.560
World's greatest lover.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.400
World poutine eating champion.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.480
I mean, can you fathom it?

09:12.480 --> 09:17.600
Can you fathom those delicious, those little pillows in the gravy,

09:17.600 --> 09:20.240
those little pillowy cheese gravy curds

09:20.800 --> 09:24.000
flown down a river right into fame and success?

09:24.000 --> 09:24.960
He talks to a scheduler.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.280
Hey, what day is the poutine eating one on?

09:27.280 --> 09:29.040
The poutine eating one is on July 5th.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.880
Is my will up to date?

09:34.480 --> 09:35.440
Am I good to go?

09:35.440 --> 09:37.040
Can you tell Mrs. Chestnut that I love her?

09:37.040 --> 09:40.880
Here's some other Joey Chestnut world records he holds right now.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.160
Grilled cheese sandwiches.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.160
He did 47 in 10 minutes.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.440
Pulled them right down.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.640
Yamadama.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.680
Horseshoe sandwich.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.840
That's an open face one.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.840
That seems a little specific.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.720
I think he's just finding some things that people probably don't eat a lot of.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.600
Joey Chestnut's grandma's special goulash.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.440
He ate one bowl in 10 minutes.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.240
He's got the Poisson record, baby.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.880
That's 7.5 Poissons in 10 minutes.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.840
Oh, I could do that.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.360
Could you?

10:09.360 --> 10:09.840
No.

10:09.840 --> 10:10.880
Interesting.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.480
I could do 6.83 Poissons.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.800
He did 53 soft-beat tacos from Taco Bell in 10 minutes.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.480
Oh, now that's a day.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.320
That is a day.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.200
That next day, Valerie, clear my week.

10:29.680 --> 10:30.720
It's gonna be tough.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.160
Yeah, I mean, I think Juice, I think we can just assume that he's gonna have bad shits

10:34.160 --> 10:35.680
for a long time after any of these.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.720
And probably has some before, right?

10:38.720 --> 10:42.720
Because he's probably taking some stimulants to clean the pipes out a little bit.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.600
Where's the, like, national celery eating day?

10:45.600 --> 10:48.640
The national, like, roughage eating day.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.920
That's probably the day before the national hot dog contest, isn't it?

10:52.640 --> 10:54.160
Okay, and that's my limit.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.080
We hit it.

10:56.080 --> 10:56.640
There it is.

10:56.640 --> 10:57.760
Oh, wow, we found it.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.800
Cool, everybody.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.600
Mark it down.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.160
We've just broken the world record for yucking out Griffin.

11:02.160 --> 11:06.400
And this is, as you've almost certainly guessed, an advice show.

11:07.920 --> 11:14.480
We are going to help you, the common person, with your queries for wisdom.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.720
And this is how we do it, just like this.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.080
My mom wants to start a YouTube channel about cooking.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.600
She told me she, quote, plans on it going viral.

11:26.320 --> 11:30.080
I've tried explaining that it doesn't work that way, but she doesn't listen.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.760
She does not even have a camera or a space to record videos,

11:33.760 --> 11:36.480
but she already has her channel and she bought a domain name.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.360
This is good.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.440
She also wants me to edit her videos.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.440
I don't know how to edit videos.

11:41.440 --> 11:45.120
How do I stop her before she throws a bunch of money into the black hole called YouTube?

11:46.560 --> 11:47.840
There it is.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.880
They don't have a funny name.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.240
They're just desperately trying to get help.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.080
That's what the username is for that one.

11:52.080 --> 11:58.000
Ooh, I mean Chewbacca Mom didn't have a fucking studio set up, did she?

11:58.000 --> 11:58.500
Yes.

11:58.500 --> 12:06.580
Chewbacca Mom didn't have a, you know, Sure S500 whatever the fuck microphone.

12:06.580 --> 12:09.940
Getting that GoPro 4K shit.

12:09.940 --> 12:14.100
I don't know how YouTubers do it, but, you know, all she had was a cell phone,

12:14.100 --> 12:17.140
a dream, and a plastic mask of Chewbacca that talked.

12:18.420 --> 12:22.420
Are you suggesting that she wears the Chewbacca mask while she does cooking?

12:22.420 --> 12:22.920
Yes.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.260
That could be funny.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.700
Chewcooka, that's all I've got.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.500
Chewbacca.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.000
Damn it.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.900
Chewbacca is good.

12:30.900 --> 12:31.400
Lubega.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.100
Wear a Lubega mask while you cook.

12:36.100 --> 12:42.020
Lubega presents Chewbacca, and Lubega pays for it and does live music in the studio

12:42.020 --> 12:44.180
while you cook wearing the Chewbacca Mom mask.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.300
This thing writes itself.

12:46.180 --> 12:47.620
That's viral right there.

12:47.620 --> 12:48.340
That's viral.

12:48.340 --> 12:50.180
That's max virality.

12:52.020 --> 12:54.980
You don't need a camera because she has a phone, right?

12:55.540 --> 12:56.580
We're halfway there.

12:56.580 --> 12:58.900
A space to record sounds like a kitchen to me.

12:59.620 --> 13:00.660
Yeah, like a kitchen.

13:00.660 --> 13:03.380
She's gonna film in her kitchen, and you don't know how to edit videos?

13:03.380 --> 13:04.500
Cut out the curses.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.780
It's that easy.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.580
Just take out the boring parts and only leave the good parts.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.540
I've seen YouTube.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.380
They have tons of edits.

13:11.380 --> 13:15.780
You cut out anything where the person isn't talking or making noise,

13:15.780 --> 13:17.060
it'll be 30 seconds long.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.420
She'll make a million dollars.

13:18.420 --> 13:19.700
Or leave the curses in.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.060
That might be viral.

13:21.060 --> 13:25.060
Like, if she's like me and burns her hands on the oven a lot,

13:25.060 --> 13:26.980
leave that in, that's gold.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.620
Imagine you had a YouTube video and it started like this.

13:29.620 --> 13:34.580
My mom, my mom asked me to edit her YouTube videos.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.660
She never said if I should leave anything in besides the curses.

13:38.660 --> 13:41.220
And it's just like two minutes of your mom being like,

13:41.220 --> 13:44.980
fuck, god damn it, shit, the fucking batter,

13:45.780 --> 13:48.180
these goddamn eggs, motherfucker.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.180
That's gonna be a good vid.

13:50.820 --> 13:51.540
It would kill.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.340
Make a ton of money.

13:52.340 --> 13:53.940
It's good to put your V on Fallon.

13:53.940 --> 13:56.100
Listen, it's good to put the secret out there, right?

13:56.100 --> 13:57.540
It's good to put your vision board out there.

13:57.540 --> 13:58.660
You want it to go viral.

13:58.660 --> 13:59.700
You plan on it going viral.

14:00.260 --> 14:01.460
That's probably half the thing.

14:01.460 --> 14:04.260
But sometimes you don't have to plan on it going viral.

14:04.260 --> 14:08.580
Sometimes it's a case of the less you want it, the more you'll get it.

14:08.580 --> 14:12.020
When I was in high school and for my TV news class,

14:12.020 --> 14:16.340
I choreographed a lightsaber fight with my friend Cory Jackson.

14:16.340 --> 14:20.500
And then we did a whole sort of light side, dark side lightsaber fight skit.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.140
I didn't think, hey, in 20 years,

14:23.140 --> 14:26.420
people are gonna fucking drag me for this so hard.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.740
They're gonna drag me for this and they won't ever let me go.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.980
They're gonna drag me and drag me and drag me until I'm bones.

14:32.260 --> 14:33.300
And it happened for me.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.500
So it can happen for your mom.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.260
Have her do a lightsaber fight.

14:37.380 --> 14:38.100
This happened to me.

14:39.380 --> 14:43.380
I was at the Huntington Pride Parade last weekend.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.300
It was a lovely, lovely affair.

14:46.020 --> 14:49.140
And I was filling in on Mamma Mia.

14:49.140 --> 14:53.780
And I was wearing one of those fun, big costumes.

14:53.780 --> 14:54.820
You know the ones?

14:54.820 --> 14:56.100
They call them super suits.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.300
I don't know, the ABBA costumes.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.100
You know what I mean?

14:58.100 --> 15:00.900
And I had a pair of gold Lemay pants on

15:00.900 --> 15:06.980
and it made the front page of Reddit, which is so exciting.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.780
The picture of me in these pants.

15:09.780 --> 15:12.420
I mean, the front page of Reddit, I went viral.

15:12.420 --> 15:16.740
Then I just went ahead and took a cruise on down to the comments

15:16.740 --> 15:20.420
and pretty much two-thirds of them were,

15:21.460 --> 15:23.380
hey, I can see this guy's whole dick.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.140
Hey, hey, your pants are too tight.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.140
We can see your entire penis, Justin.

15:29.940 --> 15:31.700
Or stranger, because I don't know you.

15:32.340 --> 15:36.260
They just made fun of me because my pants were too tight in the crotch.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.940
And I think that's why I did good on Reddit.

15:37.940 --> 15:39.460
I don't actually understand Reddit that well.

15:41.060 --> 15:42.020
Where's the bad butt?

15:42.020 --> 15:43.140
Just looking for this.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.020
Just gonna find it.

15:44.980 --> 15:45.540
Just find it.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.060
I'd rather- Oh, wow.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.340
My manzy.

15:48.340 --> 15:48.900
Wow, bud.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.020
Can you see his whole hog?

15:50.020 --> 15:51.300
Hey, bud.

15:52.020 --> 15:53.220
Now I've got to look it up.

15:53.220 --> 15:53.940
Hold on.

15:53.940 --> 15:57.380
I'd rather you guys not look at my hogs and report it, but that's okay.

15:57.940 --> 16:00.260
It's an unconventional podcast.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.020
Should I just search like gold pants?

16:02.980 --> 16:03.460
Reddit.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.300
Cool hog.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.260
It doesn't matter.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.060
Cool hog.

16:07.060 --> 16:07.700
Doesn't matter.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.340
There it is.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.060
Okay.

16:09.060 --> 16:10.580
I mean, the pants were tight.

16:10.580 --> 16:11.380
The pants were tight.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.740
The pants were tight.

16:12.740 --> 16:16.580
I can see your whole dick, dude.

16:16.580 --> 16:16.980
Yeah.

16:16.980 --> 16:18.340
It's like not a good.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.060
It's fun.

16:19.060 --> 16:19.940
It's all fun.

16:19.940 --> 16:21.140
Hey, it's good.

16:21.140 --> 16:21.380
All right.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.540
I got a Yahoo here sent in by Adrian.

16:23.540 --> 16:24.660
Kels thinks it's Adrian.

16:24.660 --> 16:27.620
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm going to call.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.980
Asks, why don't we just crush our trash?

16:37.220 --> 16:38.980
Why don't we just crush our trash?

16:40.900 --> 16:42.020
We got all this trash.

16:42.020 --> 16:42.820
I've seen it.

16:42.820 --> 16:45.220
It's bad, Wally, but real.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.020
Can you imagine?

16:46.660 --> 16:49.620
And it's taken up a lot of space, right?

16:50.500 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.780 --> 16:54.980
Well, when I have food on my plate and I want like,

16:54.980 --> 16:58.340
if I have a big piece of bread and I can't fit it in my mouth,

16:58.900 --> 17:00.660
what do I do to it, Travis?

17:00.660 --> 17:01.620
You crush it up.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.780
I crush it in my hand and I put it,

17:03.780 --> 17:05.780
I squeeze it as hard as I possibly can.

17:05.780 --> 17:10.420
And I make a little bread gumball and I just just pop that in there.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.660
So let's do that with trash, except we do not eat it.

17:13.540 --> 17:14.340
Do you mean-

17:14.340 --> 17:15.540
Griffin, I'm sorry.

17:15.540 --> 17:18.580
I'm going to save you from having to get this on Twitter.

17:18.580 --> 17:19.780
Do you mean like Wally?

17:21.940 --> 17:23.860
No, because that was a fun-

17:23.860 --> 17:25.140
I think you're confused again,

17:25.140 --> 17:28.260
because I literally just said this, but that was a fun movie.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.900
This would be a real crushing of trash.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.340
A real trash crush.

17:32.340 --> 17:32.660
Yes.

17:32.660 --> 17:33.940
They do do-

17:33.940 --> 17:35.220
The truck does this.

17:35.220 --> 17:35.860
Yes.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.380
We don't need to do this in our home.

17:37.380 --> 17:38.020
The truck does it.

17:38.020 --> 17:39.300
Well, I-

17:39.300 --> 17:40.100
That is true.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.780
I live in fear of that.

17:41.780 --> 17:44.020
That's the thing, but we can say that.

17:44.580 --> 17:47.460
It's sort of a, oh boy, it's sort of a Schrodinger's cat,

17:47.460 --> 17:52.580
because nobody's been inside to confirm that the trash is getting crushed inside the truck.

17:52.580 --> 17:56.500
But if somebody did go inside to confirm it, they wouldn't be able to get out.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.580
That's a Catch-22 and a Schrodinger's cat.

17:59.620 --> 17:59.860
Yeah.

18:00.740 --> 18:03.540
That's what happens with Schrodinger's cat is until you look in the box,

18:03.540 --> 18:05.700
you don't know if the cat has been crushed or not.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.660
But when you do look, it's made it crushed.

18:08.660 --> 18:11.460
Okay, it's not a Schrodinger's cat, it's just a Catch-22.

18:11.460 --> 18:12.340
I take it back.

18:12.340 --> 18:12.900
I think a lot of-

18:12.900 --> 18:13.780
It's just a crushed cat.

18:13.780 --> 18:14.740
Yeah, it's a, yeah.

18:15.300 --> 18:15.460
So-

18:16.260 --> 18:18.260
Don't put your cats into trash.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.380
This is obvious, thank you.

18:19.940 --> 18:22.900
The trash truck, we don't know if it's doing what it's supposed to be doing.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.140
It makes a lot of noise, but nobody actually gets in there.

18:25.140 --> 18:25.780
So-

18:25.780 --> 18:28.020
But here's the problem, if you crushed it, Griffin,

18:28.020 --> 18:32.820
and then you delivered it to the sanitation workers all crushed up already,

18:32.820 --> 18:35.460
they're like, well, what do I do?

18:35.460 --> 18:37.140
What are we gonna do?

18:37.140 --> 18:38.900
I love making the trash a small.

18:40.660 --> 18:43.140
Yeah, like that's gotta be the best.

18:43.140 --> 18:46.740
When you get like a gnarly crunch from like, I don't know,

18:46.740 --> 18:49.620
a big bag of like light bulbs or something.

18:49.620 --> 18:50.420
Yeah, I threw-

18:50.420 --> 18:53.780
Or like they left some of those air pocket packing materials

18:53.780 --> 18:55.940
that Amazon does sometimes, you know what I mean?

18:55.940 --> 18:56.660
Oh, yeah.

18:56.660 --> 19:00.500
Left Joey Chestnut in the can and he got made real little.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.780
Oh, I forgot to get him out.

19:01.780 --> 19:02.260
Oh, no.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.740
I mean, I tried to answer your question.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.660
You scrunch it up, get it tiny.

19:06.660 --> 19:07.780
Better for environment.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.540
You ship it on off to your garbage town.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.340
What do they do?

19:10.340 --> 19:11.780
They crush it even tinier, man.

19:12.420 --> 19:12.740
Whoa.

19:15.060 --> 19:16.900
Can you imagine eating Joey Chestnut?

19:18.020 --> 19:20.820
This is a wild gastrointestinal episode.

19:20.820 --> 19:24.500
This episode is a just sort of journey through the GI tract.

19:27.620 --> 19:30.420
If you ate him, it would be an unreal-

19:30.420 --> 19:30.900
Okay.

19:30.900 --> 19:31.940
An unreal flavor.

19:31.940 --> 19:33.220
All right, I'll explain this game.

19:33.220 --> 19:35.540
It's 9 p.m. tomorrow, July 4th.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.140
You eat Joey Chestnut.

19:40.260 --> 19:41.540
There's no way.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.100
Okay, no.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.460
Wait, let me finish the question.

19:43.460 --> 19:45.380
There's no way I'm eating Joey Chestnut

19:45.380 --> 19:47.380
when he's all fucking full of chewed up hot dogs.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.940
If you did it in nine minutes and 59 seconds,

19:49.940 --> 19:50.580
you automatically become the winner.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.260
Are you now the winner of the-

19:52.260 --> 19:53.620
Yes, thank you, Travis.

19:53.620 --> 19:54.900
And this is not a bore thing.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.180
Shut the fuck up.

19:56.180 --> 19:58.820
If you ate Joey Chestnut at 9 p.m. tomorrow,

19:58.820 --> 20:02.260
have you now eaten 71 hot dog soup disgust?

20:02.820 --> 20:03.140
Yes.

20:03.140 --> 20:07.300
71 hot dogs, plus all the hot dogs he's ever eaten

20:07.300 --> 20:09.540
to become the person he is today.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.460
He is more hot dog than man.

20:12.740 --> 20:13.540
That's what I'm saying.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.380
It's like dry-aged.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.420
Mm-hmm.

20:16.420 --> 20:17.220
He is foie gras.

20:17.220 --> 20:18.580
Dry-aged.

20:18.580 --> 20:22.340
It's like corn-fed, except it's poutine

20:22.340 --> 20:23.860
and grilled cheese sandwich-fed.

20:24.580 --> 20:27.380
Okay, so can we crush our trash though

20:27.380 --> 20:29.060
and make it littler, better for-

20:29.060 --> 20:32.100
You know, I'm pretty sure that the Big Bang happened, right?

20:32.100 --> 20:33.220
Yeah.

20:33.220 --> 20:34.740
And then everything's expanding out,

20:34.740 --> 20:38.260
and then eventually everything will retract back in.

20:38.260 --> 20:41.380
So let's help it out by squishing our trash down.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.060
I don't think there's a reason not to.

20:43.060 --> 20:46.260
I'd rather risk it being true and not need it.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.060
You know what I mean?

20:47.060 --> 20:49.380
And it's better for me now to squish my trash down

20:49.380 --> 20:51.940
because I don't have to take the freaking stuff out as much.

20:51.940 --> 20:52.980
So it's better and better and better.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.100
But then when I do take it out,

20:54.100 --> 20:55.700
it's gonna weigh about 700 pounds.

20:55.700 --> 20:56.900
There's that.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.580
Because I've crushed it down so tight.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.980
Right.

21:00.980 --> 21:02.900
I do this with milk cartons.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.740
Oh, la-dee-da, Justin.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.180
I do this with milk cartons,

21:06.180 --> 21:08.020
and then after I squish all the air out of them,

21:08.020 --> 21:11.460
I put the cap back on so they can't re-inflate.

21:11.460 --> 21:14.580
Ow, these fucking tricky milk cartons always.

21:15.780 --> 21:16.260
And the trash-

21:16.820 --> 21:18.180
Us millennials will try anything.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.820
The trash people love to make balloons out of these things.

21:20.820 --> 21:22.340
Justin won't let them with his-

21:22.340 --> 21:23.700
You know what I do?

21:23.700 --> 21:24.420
What I do?

21:24.420 --> 21:26.980
I use my milk cartons to make bird feeders.

21:27.700 --> 21:28.260
Oh, that's so good.

21:28.260 --> 21:30.180
And then when the birds are inside it, I crush them.

21:31.060 --> 21:31.940
Okay, not good.

21:31.940 --> 21:33.220
Gotta stop talking about crushing animals.

21:33.220 --> 21:34.180
We just gotta talk about-

21:34.180 --> 21:35.060
Here, let's talk about-

21:35.060 --> 21:36.580
Hey, don't crush animals.

21:36.580 --> 21:37.380
Let's make a rule.

21:37.940 --> 21:39.860
No more talking about eating Joey Chestnut

21:39.860 --> 21:41.780
or crushing animals in this episode.

21:41.780 --> 21:44.020
If we can just go for the rest of them.

21:44.020 --> 21:44.900
I will try.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.700
I take my soda cans and I cut them into shuriken.

21:48.500 --> 21:48.820
Okay.

21:49.780 --> 21:50.100
Okay.

21:50.100 --> 21:50.580
So I can use them-

21:50.580 --> 21:51.940
Now crush those shurikens.

21:51.940 --> 21:52.980
Yeah, when I'm done with the shurikens,

21:52.980 --> 21:54.100
they will also get crushed.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.460
I was at work at a donut shop.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.740
God, that was a seamless transition.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.900
I thought you worked at a donut shop and I never knew it.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.700
No, I was at work at a donut shop.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.420
That's a wild way of putting that, by the way.

22:08.980 --> 22:11.380
That's like you work and you just happen to show up

22:11.380 --> 22:12.500
at a donut shop and say,

22:12.500 --> 22:14.100
I'm gonna do the work here today.

22:14.900 --> 22:18.260
I was at work at a donut shop when a customer asked me,

22:18.260 --> 22:20.100
what is the best donut for a 14 year old?

22:21.380 --> 22:23.060
After studying the menu a long time,

22:23.060 --> 22:25.700
I said the first flavor that came to mind, blueberry.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.020
But I'm afraid I may have led her astray

22:28.020 --> 22:30.100
and not given her the correct recommendation.

22:30.100 --> 22:30.820
Help me, brothers.

22:31.540 --> 22:35.060
What is the best donut for a 14 year old?

22:35.060 --> 22:38.420
That's from Donut Dilemma in Dallas.

22:38.420 --> 22:39.780
Blueberry's not bad.

22:39.780 --> 22:43.300
Yeah, I appreciate that you think we know

22:43.300 --> 22:46.580
what the best anything for a 14 year old is

22:46.580 --> 22:49.780
because I think you can look at our body of work

22:49.780 --> 22:52.580
and know that that is not true.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.420
I don't think we know, as evidenced by the fact

22:54.420 --> 22:57.700
that we keep making these fucking Fortnite jokes, fam,

22:57.700 --> 23:00.180
and there's nobody playing this thing anymore.

23:00.900 --> 23:03.860
Everybody's back on Minecraft again and ding dong ditch.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.940
It's Minecraft and ding dong ditch now.

23:05.940 --> 23:06.420
Oh, man.

23:06.420 --> 23:09.060
Sorry, I stepped away from the computer for 35 seconds.

23:09.060 --> 23:10.340
How about a Fortnite donut?

23:11.940 --> 23:14.020
Maybe a Joey Chestnut flavor.

23:14.020 --> 23:14.580
Damn it.

23:14.580 --> 23:15.380
Damn it.

23:15.380 --> 23:16.020
Karishika Dog.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.100
This show sucks.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.620
Maybe that's an ironic donut.

23:21.620 --> 23:23.380
Yeah, maybe.

23:23.380 --> 23:24.740
Blueberry's really good.

23:24.740 --> 23:25.240
I just...

23:26.820 --> 23:29.380
14, start in high school, body.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.380
I'm trying to put us in the right head space

23:31.380 --> 23:32.260
to talk about the donut.

23:32.260 --> 23:32.500
Okay.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.300
Let's everybody get, everybody, it's Griffin.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.100
Get 14!

23:36.100 --> 23:36.900
Okay.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.980
Body's changing, high school.

23:39.780 --> 23:42.020
Things are changing on the body.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.460
And driving a car soon, scared of that.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.140
But not yet.

23:47.140 --> 23:47.860
Not yet.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.900
And friends going away, friends coming back.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.340
And what am I gonna-

23:52.340 --> 23:53.940
Wait, where'd they come back from?

23:53.940 --> 23:55.060
What am I gonna be?

23:55.620 --> 23:59.700
And the changes are so, there's just changes

23:59.700 --> 24:01.620
on changes of the body on top of changes.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.180
And real quick, what's the best donut?

24:04.180 --> 24:05.220
Donut holes.

24:05.220 --> 24:05.720
Joey.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.780
I didn't get you in the right head space, did I?

24:09.780 --> 24:12.660
No, I don't, I mean, I liked them all.

24:13.460 --> 24:14.340
I liked them all.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.260
A Pokemon donut.

24:17.460 --> 24:17.960
Okay.

24:17.960 --> 24:20.520
Okay, collect them all.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.040
You know what, I got it.

24:24.040 --> 24:24.920
I fucking got it.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.560
Donut stick.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.160
Some kind of one-handed stick-based donut.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.720
This is the donut the teens are gonna crave.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.800
It is easy to hold with one hand.

24:35.800 --> 24:39.880
Unlike your ringed donuts that make me exhausted

24:39.880 --> 24:40.920
to eat with both hands.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.760
This is one sleek, sleek, pocketable donut.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.360
A donut you can start working on

24:46.360 --> 24:48.760
and then maybe you wanna talk to your friends

24:48.760 --> 24:52.920
over FaceTime, like the youngs do.

24:52.920 --> 24:56.200
Then you slide the donut right into your pocket

24:56.200 --> 24:57.560
and you don't even sweat it.

24:58.520 --> 24:59.880
It has a cap.

24:59.880 --> 25:00.380
Yes.

25:00.920 --> 25:04.440
It has a cap on it and you can save it for later.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.640
Don't worry about it.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.640
We can all agree, no jelly filled,

25:07.640 --> 25:09.560
that's just gonna get on your jinkos.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.160
No, of course not jelly filled.

25:11.160 --> 25:14.760
The jinkos are gonna facilitate pocketing

25:14.760 --> 25:16.440
this big donut, sure.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.560
It's got millennial flavors like paprika and coriander.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.680
Coriander, yeah.

25:20.680 --> 25:24.200
And there is bacon on it for certain.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.120
Choc-a-block with CBD.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.480
Gotta get it in there.

25:27.480 --> 25:27.960
Oh yeah.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.000
Gotta get it in there.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.320
And oh boy.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.320
And maybe they're collectible.

25:34.680 --> 25:40.200
It looks and printed on it is the face of Billy Eilish

25:40.200 --> 25:46.120
or Eilish, I've never heard someone say it out loud.

25:46.120 --> 25:46.920
Nailed it.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.240
Yeah.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.560
One of those two is on there.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.120
That's cool.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.000
That's cool.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.760
And maybe inside of every 10,000th donut is a ticket

25:57.480 --> 26:05.480
and you can exchange that to FaceTime with Billy for one minute

26:05.480 --> 26:11.640
because everybody wants to get a touch of this new kind of fame

26:11.640 --> 26:12.920
that's been going around.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.600
A touch of the Eilish.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.960
And that's all, oh that's good.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.480
So that's a good donut.

26:19.480 --> 26:20.680
Is it gonna taste good?

26:20.680 --> 26:21.800
Who the fuck cares?

26:21.800 --> 26:23.320
No, it's ironic.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.640
Teens are not tasting things these days.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.960
It's about being seen.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.840
They've burned their tongue on all their lattes.

26:30.840 --> 26:31.560
No, I'll tell you what.

26:31.560 --> 26:34.280
I'll tell you what's gonna help get this over

26:34.280 --> 26:39.800
is if we have a promotion with every teacher in every school ever

26:39.800 --> 26:42.840
and like school superintendent, president, all the faculty

26:42.840 --> 26:46.440
that these donuts are not allowed in the school.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.880
Yes, ban them like pogs.

26:49.880 --> 26:51.480
Ban them like pogs.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.840
And more recently, little vapes.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.960
But let's do pogs.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.160
And then these are gonna be so fucking hot.

26:59.160 --> 27:02.280
You're gonna be in the bathroom taking a whiz

27:02.280 --> 27:03.880
and you're gonna hear pop.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.520
And you know that's the donut cap coming off.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.160
And you know somebody's breaking the rules in there.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.440
Oh, that's fucking cool.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.520
That's so fucking cool.

27:12.520 --> 27:13.800
Man, that's a cool donut.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.840
I wish I could eat it.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.320
Also, it's a tech deck.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.160
It's got wheels on it, this donut.

27:19.160 --> 27:19.960
Whoa.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.240
You don't like tech decks.

27:21.240 --> 27:21.800
Are you kidding me?

27:21.800 --> 27:22.920
And it's gigantic.

27:23.720 --> 27:24.680
They're so over.

27:24.680 --> 27:25.720
Tech decks are over.

27:25.720 --> 27:26.360
Tech decks are back.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.160
Minecraft's back.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.200
Fortnite's out.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.640
Vaping is out.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.560
Soap carving is out.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.000
Roller skates are in.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.160
And being not-

27:35.160 --> 27:36.920
I'm gonna try to buy a tech deck right now.

27:36.920 --> 27:37.800
Okay.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.360
How, Griffin, is soap carving in or out?

27:40.360 --> 27:42.280
Soap carving's way in.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.200
Candle making is out.

27:44.200 --> 27:44.700
Damn it.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.480
I like both of those things equally.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.480
Yeah, they're on Amazon.

27:49.480 --> 27:49.960
You're right.

27:49.960 --> 27:50.600
Are they back?

27:50.600 --> 27:52.360
They're back, motherfucker.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.880
Grind one out with your fingers.

27:55.880 --> 28:01.800
My cool donut.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.080
Are you buying a tech deck right now?

28:04.040 --> 28:05.240
No, I googled it.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.480
It said, are tech decks worth money?

28:09.880 --> 28:11.000
I mean, they're worth something.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.240
Are you talking about they're collectible?

28:13.240 --> 28:22.440
There is a story from as recently as March 14th, 2019, titled, Are Tech Decks Cool Again?

28:22.440 --> 28:26.920
So I guess they are coming back.

28:26.920 --> 28:27.720
Fuck yeah.

28:27.720 --> 28:28.920
There is a chance, yeah.

28:28.920 --> 28:34.200
Instagram fingerboarder SpookyFB said, fingerboards are not toys.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.680
They are professional things.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.720
They're professional things made of wood.

28:42.840 --> 28:45.480
Big trucks and professional wheels.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.000
Big trucks?

28:47.000 --> 28:51.160
Fingerboards are not toys.

28:51.160 --> 28:56.680
They're professional things made of wood, big trucks and professional wheels.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.280
Are we talking about different things?

28:58.920 --> 29:03.080
This is like the fucking fushigi contact juggling thing again, I bet.

29:03.080 --> 29:07.400
Where we talked about fushigi and a bunch of dope contact jugglers were like,

29:07.400 --> 29:09.160
fushigi is bullshit.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.280
They tried to steal our whole thing and brand it.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.120
And maybe that's how tech deck did.

29:14.680 --> 29:15.960
You know what I'm saying?

29:15.960 --> 29:17.320
Maybe it's that same situation.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.800
I also am really excited because this video I just opened

29:20.920 --> 29:26.120
starts with a person sitting there with two tiny skateboards in front of them

29:26.120 --> 29:30.280
and what appears to be a miniature rail that one might grind upon.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.760
Hey folks at home, this is Griffin.

29:32.760 --> 29:33.480
This is the edit.

29:33.480 --> 29:38.120
I just wanted to hop in here and say that I cut out 45 minutes of us talking about tech decks

29:38.120 --> 29:40.280
and tech tech tech tech technology.

29:40.280 --> 29:44.360
So I'm just going to hop forward and drop you back in at the point where

29:44.360 --> 29:47.560
Justin has just spent $150 on tech tech blind bags.

29:47.560 --> 29:48.600
So here comes that.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.760
I just don't know what I'm going to do.

29:51.320 --> 29:54.040
I mean, I have a family to support.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.040
I can't be doing this just to prove a point.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.520
That was your grocery money for the week, Justin.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.400
To prove a point, I'm going to buy $150.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.400
I'm going to have a lot of fun, sure.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.640
But you can't feed your family with tech techs.

30:05.640 --> 30:06.280
You can.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.680
Wait, there is one thing I could try.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.480
What's that?

30:09.480 --> 30:22.200
We could go to the money zone.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.320
Hey, I did a funny thing on Wonderful with Zip Recruiter this week.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.920
Can I try and do it for you guys?

30:26.920 --> 30:27.320
Sure.

30:27.320 --> 30:27.880
Zip it.

30:27.880 --> 30:28.520
Sure.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.080
You remember?

30:30.280 --> 30:31.880
Rachel hated it, but I was like, you can zip it.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.640
Did you say that to your wife a lot?

30:35.640 --> 30:37.000
I always said that to her.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.400
You said that to your wife, who you love?

30:39.400 --> 30:40.200
Yeah, I love her.

30:40.200 --> 30:40.920
And she didn't like it.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.160
The mother of your child, your life partner?

30:43.160 --> 30:45.000
Hated it, hated it, hated the thing.

30:45.000 --> 30:45.640
And you know what?

30:45.640 --> 30:47.720
You know who else I don't know if they liked it or not?

30:47.720 --> 30:49.000
Zip Recruiter.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.120
I don't know if they like that heat of me yelling zip it

30:52.120 --> 30:56.920
and have a suckle in my zipple to the love of my life.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.480
I don't know if they like that, but you know what they do like?

30:59.480 --> 31:01.880
Fucking helping you hire good people for your jobs.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.240
That's cool.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.200
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

31:04.200 --> 31:07.640
If you have a job opening and it's hard to hire people

31:07.640 --> 31:09.320
because you have to go through a billion resumes

31:09.320 --> 31:11.080
and check out all of these different job boards

31:11.080 --> 31:14.200
all across the globe and you have to fly to the boards

31:14.200 --> 31:16.360
and it sucks, don't do that anymore.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.440
Zip Recruiter will send your job to over 100

31:18.440 --> 31:19.960
of the web's leading job boards.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.760
And then they use this powerful matching technology

31:23.400 --> 31:27.720
created by the hive mind AI that actually controls

31:27.720 --> 31:28.520
all world governments.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.440
And it scans thousands of resumes to find people

31:32.440 --> 31:33.400
with the right experience.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.480
And then it invites them to apply for your job.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.480
It is so effective that four out of five employers

31:37.480 --> 31:39.480
who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate

31:39.480 --> 31:41.080
through the site within the first day.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.240
Right now, our listeners can try Zip Recruiter

31:43.240 --> 31:45.000
for free at this exclusive web address,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.960
ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

31:47.960 --> 31:51.720
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.880
Zip Recruiter, the smartest way to hire.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.640
I've just had an idea for a superhero

31:58.520 --> 32:02.120
that is Leonardo DiCaprio as himself.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.200
But now he has electricity powers

32:04.200 --> 32:07.320
and I call him Leonardo DiCaprio.

32:07.320 --> 32:10.120
And I would like to promote this new superhero.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.440
And I'm gonna need a web presence to do that.

32:12.440 --> 32:16.520
So I've decided to set up Leonardo DiCaprio.com

32:17.080 --> 32:18.840
using Squarespace.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.320
Hi friends, my name is Justin McElroy

32:21.320 --> 32:25.080
and I'm a podcaster on the popular podcast, Sawbones.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.800
I'm here to talk with you about an important problem

32:27.800 --> 32:30.200
facing the internet today and that's Squarespace.

32:30.200 --> 32:34.040
Squarespace started with the noblest of intentions

32:34.040 --> 32:36.040
but now enables any idea,

32:36.680 --> 32:40.200
no matter how fucking dumb, to have its own website.

32:40.200 --> 32:44.920
Squarespace randomly and without any sort of background check

32:44.920 --> 32:48.120
will allow anyone to showcase their work,

32:48.120 --> 32:50.600
announce an upcoming event or special project,

32:50.600 --> 32:52.360
even a very stupid one,

32:52.360 --> 32:54.840
or promote their physical or online business

32:55.400 --> 32:58.840
despite the fact that it may be really, really stupid.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.360
Leonardo DiCaprio is free.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.200
They'll let you sell things from their website.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.560
They'll help anyone 24-7.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.480
They've got award-winning customer support

33:09.480 --> 33:15.400
that again does not check for the sort of stability

33:15.400 --> 33:18.280
of your idea, the advisability, anything.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.400
They'll just let anyone make their own website

33:21.400 --> 33:23.240
and I hope that you'll take the chance

33:23.240 --> 33:26.680
to speak out about this to anyone who will listen.

33:26.680 --> 33:30.440
And if you could, please go to squarespace.com

33:30.440 --> 33:31.880
slash my brother.

33:31.880 --> 33:33.560
You can do a free trial

33:33.560 --> 33:35.560
and then put up a website that's not dumb.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.880
A good one to help counterbalance

33:37.880 --> 33:41.160
some of these real turds that my brother's posting up,

33:41.160 --> 33:42.440
these utter bricks.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.360
Use the offer code my brother

33:44.360 --> 33:46.600
when you're ready to launch and save 10%

33:46.600 --> 33:50.520
off your first purchase of a website or a domain.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.840
Squarespace, they must be stopped.

33:52.840 --> 33:53.640
I purchased it.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.920
Hey folks, this is Griffin, just another edit point here.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.480
Justin and Travis had a really nasty argument

33:59.480 --> 34:01.080
about Leonardo DiCaprio here

34:01.080 --> 34:02.040
and I didn't want you to hear it

34:02.040 --> 34:03.320
because it lasts a long time

34:03.320 --> 34:05.560
and horrible words were exchanged.

34:05.560 --> 34:06.920
So I'm just going to cut you in

34:06.920 --> 34:08.280
and drop you back in at the point

34:08.280 --> 34:10.600
where Justin now loves Leonardo DiCaprio

34:10.600 --> 34:12.280
and thinks it's the funniest shit in the world.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.240
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

34:15.240 --> 34:16.360
Listen to this.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.560
He loves fast food.

34:18.520 --> 34:19.880
He's the craviator.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.200
Okay?

34:22.200 --> 34:23.800
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.080
Hey, I'm Janet Varney

34:27.080 --> 34:28.680
and like many of you,

34:28.680 --> 34:30.360
some more recent than others,

34:30.360 --> 34:32.360
I used to be a teenager.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.680
In fact, just about all of my friends were too,

34:34.680 --> 34:37.960
including wonderful women like Alison Brie.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.120
I'm dead center on the balance beam

34:40.120 --> 34:41.800
and this is like a big gym.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.280
All the kids' parents are there watching.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.480
I have to stop, like, you know,

34:45.480 --> 34:47.240
when you have to pee so bad and you can't even move

34:47.240 --> 34:48.600
and then I just go.

34:48.600 --> 34:52.120
I just pee right in the middle of the high back.

34:52.120 --> 34:55.800
So join me every week on the JV Club podcast

34:55.800 --> 34:59.080
where I speak with complicated, funny, messy humans

34:59.080 --> 35:00.920
as we reminisce about our adolescences

35:00.920 --> 35:03.560
and how they led us to becoming who we are.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.800
Find it every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.760
Here's another question.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.000
Some drunk lads just peed through

35:13.640 --> 35:15.000
the mail slot of my front door

35:15.000 --> 35:15.960
and into my living room.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.240
I live alone, so opening the door

35:17.240 --> 35:19.400
and confronting them was not worth the life risk.

35:19.400 --> 35:19.960
Very smart.

35:19.960 --> 35:23.960
What door modifications should I make

35:24.600 --> 35:26.360
to ensure this doesn't happen again?

35:26.360 --> 35:30.360
And that's from Camp Pee-tained in Ireland.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.040
Now that I'm reading this,

35:32.040 --> 35:34.520
you know who would be perfect for this

35:34.520 --> 35:37.240
is Jesse Eisenberg.

35:37.240 --> 35:40.280
Let me see if I can get him on the line.

35:40.280 --> 35:43.880
You always just have the right, the perfect person

35:43.880 --> 35:45.320
just at the front of the line.

35:45.320 --> 35:48.520
Bring, bring, bring, bring Deborah, Deborah.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.160
Deborah, he's got a Ray Romano ringtone.

35:51.160 --> 35:51.720
It's so strange.

35:51.720 --> 35:52.120
Is that him?

35:52.120 --> 35:53.080
Hey, Jesse.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.200
Yeah, hey, everybody loves me.

35:54.200 --> 35:54.440
Yeah.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.720
Hey, everybody loves Jesse

35:57.720 --> 35:59.800
coming to Crackle this fall.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.840
Jesse from the Art of Self-Defense.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.680
It's such a pleasure to have you here on our show.

36:08.680 --> 36:11.720
I introduced everybody that way

36:11.720 --> 36:13.560
from their next feature film project.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.480
It's really polite.

36:15.480 --> 36:19.880
Yeah, that's how we introduce my family at Thanksgiving.

36:19.880 --> 36:20.680
We just go around the room

36:20.680 --> 36:21.960
and talk about our next feature film.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.000
This is Justin's demo reel

36:25.000 --> 36:27.880
for the next Late Night Host spot.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.200
And so far, I think it's going fucking great.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.440
So Jesse, this listener of ours,

36:32.440 --> 36:36.520
someone peed in their mail slot into the living room

36:36.520 --> 36:38.680
and they didn't want to open the door

36:38.680 --> 36:39.800
so they didn't get beat up.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.520
But they want to,

36:41.080 --> 36:43.480
do you have any ideas for how to keep people

36:43.480 --> 36:46.680
from peeing in your mail slot?

36:46.680 --> 36:48.360
I bet this happens all the time in Hollywood.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.400
This has got to be...

36:49.400 --> 36:50.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.200
It's a major deal over there.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.680
Yes, well, a few things.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.560
The first thing is get an external mailbox.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.360
You know, have it out by the street.

37:00.360 --> 37:04.680
Don't have this kind of immediate access to your house.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.440
The other thing I wanted to say is,

37:06.440 --> 37:08.200
well, first of all, you don't really need mail anymore.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.800
You can do everything paperless, okay?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.280
That should go without saying.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.480
And the third, though, this exact thing happened to me,

37:16.120 --> 37:17.480
but it was not pee.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.240
A guy used to kind of defecate outside my house

37:21.240 --> 37:24.680
in New York City almost nightly.

37:24.680 --> 37:26.680
And I didn't know what to do.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.840
I knew who it was because I would see him.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.440
I didn't know how to confront him.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.480
So I was so nervous.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.920
And then my friend came over

37:33.480 --> 37:35.320
and we were looking out the window

37:35.320 --> 37:36.840
and I saw that was the guy.

37:36.840 --> 37:37.960
So my friend said, oh, hold on.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.320
I'll go out there and talk to him.

37:39.320 --> 37:39.880
I was shocked.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.520
So I watched from the safety of my window

37:42.520 --> 37:44.360
as my friend walked up,

37:44.360 --> 37:47.000
shook this guy's hand and started talking to him.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.080
He was like a homeless guy in the area

37:50.200 --> 37:52.520
and he needed some new shoes.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.880
So my friend came back in my house and said,

37:53.880 --> 37:55.160
hey, do you still have that pair of shoes?

37:55.160 --> 37:56.680
Because I had a pair of shoes that were given to me

37:56.680 --> 37:58.200
because actors sometimes get clothing.

37:58.200 --> 37:58.840
I said, I do.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.520
So he brought him the shoes.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.480
They talked for like 15 minutes

38:03.480 --> 38:05.320
and the guy never did again.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.320
And also my friend was like able to help him out

38:07.320 --> 38:08.680
and met up with him again.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.120
It turned out to be this, you know,

38:10.120 --> 38:12.200
from this kind of scary situation

38:12.200 --> 38:14.520
to this like really beautiful reconciliation

38:14.520 --> 38:16.840
with somebody who I would not have otherwise spoken to.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.200
Jesse, do you find,

38:18.200 --> 38:20.520
cause this is something I find in my day-to-day life.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.680
I find that people who can directly communicate

38:22.680 --> 38:25.320
with other people about issues in their lives

38:25.880 --> 38:26.920
in these sorts of situations

38:26.920 --> 38:28.600
seem to have a sort of superpower

38:28.600 --> 38:30.040
that is unfathomable to me.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.200
The idea that you would just go out and ask the person,

38:32.200 --> 38:33.640
it would be great if you would not do that.

38:33.640 --> 38:34.920
It would be excellent for me.

38:35.960 --> 38:37.640
So this is my best friend, Lee.

38:37.640 --> 38:41.480
He's taught in the juvenile justice system

38:41.480 --> 38:45.800
for kids who are incarcerated for the last like 22 years.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.960
He just celebrated his 22nd year of teaching.

38:47.960 --> 38:52.680
And he has this magical way of speaking with people.

38:52.680 --> 38:56.200
Now this is a guy who's like my level of like social confidence,

38:56.200 --> 38:58.360
which is to say like not soaring.

38:59.560 --> 39:02.680
And yet when it comes to like talking to people

39:02.680 --> 39:06.440
who are in need of some extra help in society,

39:06.440 --> 39:07.960
he is unbelievable.

39:07.960 --> 39:10.200
Like he couldn't even teach in a regular school

39:10.200 --> 39:12.040
because he kind of felt like intimidated by the kids,

39:12.040 --> 39:13.880
but working with incarcerated kids

39:13.880 --> 39:16.280
who are in need of some extra attention, he thrives.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.000
That's amazing.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.600
Now see, this is good because my answer is going to be

39:20.600 --> 39:22.760
put some fake teeth on your mailbox

39:22.760 --> 39:24.440
to make it look like a monster

39:24.440 --> 39:26.600
so people won't put their genitals near it.

39:26.600 --> 39:27.640
But yours is nice.

39:27.640 --> 39:27.960
Yeah.

39:27.960 --> 39:28.760
Yours is a nice-

39:28.760 --> 39:30.520
Yeah, my answer is better.

39:30.520 --> 39:31.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.920
So just to summarize, the answers,

39:34.920 --> 39:38.520
the advice here is exterior mailbox

39:38.520 --> 39:40.120
because nobody can pee in that.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.600
And then I think the mail slot in the door

39:44.600 --> 39:47.320
is just that era is over.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.520
Doors are there for a reason.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.680
We can't put fucking holes in them.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.160
That's the fortress gate.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.960
And then the third thing is when some drunk lads come

39:55.960 --> 39:57.640
and pee right into your house,

39:57.640 --> 40:01.800
the first thing is pay it forward right then and there.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.200
That's right.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.120
You have to have an extra pair of shoes on hand.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.080
That's important.

40:05.080 --> 40:08.200
Jesse, I'd like to talk about your new movie, Art of Soul Defense.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.320
We've all watched it,

40:09.320 --> 40:11.720
which I know people in these sorts of situations

40:11.720 --> 40:14.680
are always supposed to say, but we really did.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.480
We actually did.

40:15.480 --> 40:15.960
Okay.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.120
We really did because we talked about it afterwards

40:18.120 --> 40:20.600
and we just adored it.

40:21.480 --> 40:27.640
It kind of reminded me of the first thing I ever saw you in,

40:27.640 --> 40:29.240
which was Roger Dodger,

40:29.240 --> 40:33.560
which was in and of itself sort of this exploration

40:33.560 --> 40:35.480
of masculinity.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.320
It's about an uncle teaching his nephew

40:37.320 --> 40:39.960
how to, quote, be a man, unquote.

40:39.960 --> 40:43.320
And I would say it subverts it towards the end somewhat,

40:43.320 --> 40:45.240
but I think in the Art of Self-Defense-

40:45.240 --> 40:46.840
It gets into the underlying sadness.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.200
Yeah, it gets into the sadness of it.

40:48.200 --> 40:51.080
I feel like this is a much harder subversion

40:51.080 --> 40:53.640
of the idea of masculinity.

40:54.600 --> 40:55.080
Yes.

40:55.080 --> 40:55.320
Wow.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.120
And thank you for putting my oeuvre into context.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.040
I actually never thought about it that way,

41:00.040 --> 41:01.320
but you're exactly right.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.440
It does, yeah, that other movie, Roger Dodger,

41:04.440 --> 41:08.920
is kind of like a naturalistic kind of funny drama about that,

41:08.920 --> 41:12.520
whereas this movie is like this very subversive,

41:13.080 --> 41:18.680
harsh, blunt kind of take on a kind of commentary

41:18.680 --> 41:19.640
on masculinity.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.720
I mean, the movie is hysterically funny,

41:21.720 --> 41:27.160
but also displays men talking about masculinity

41:27.160 --> 41:28.680
in such absurd ways.

41:28.680 --> 41:34.440
I feel like it almost has to be as sort of outlandish

41:34.440 --> 41:36.760
and nearly surreal as it is,

41:36.760 --> 41:39.960
just so the people that took Fight Club seriously

41:39.960 --> 41:41.000
don't watch it and be like,

41:41.000 --> 41:42.040
yeah, this is good.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.240
I'm loving this.

41:43.240 --> 41:43.800
This is a live fact.

41:43.800 --> 41:44.680
That's exactly how I should act.

41:44.680 --> 41:45.800
This is the way I want to go.

41:47.160 --> 41:47.560
Right.

41:47.560 --> 41:50.120
I'd be really surprised if somebody took it

41:50.120 --> 41:54.280
as a kind of sincere how-to guide on masculinity.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.040
Jesse, it's 2019, bud.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.880
Yeah, so much is happening.

41:57.880 --> 41:58.840
For sure.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.000
All that smart stuff's real cool, and I get it,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.160
and it's good, and it makes the movie good.

42:03.160 --> 42:06.440
But like, also, dude, just some badass fights in here.

42:06.440 --> 42:09.480
You kick some, dude, Jesse, Jesse, bud,

42:09.480 --> 42:11.800
you kick some major tush in this one, man.

42:12.680 --> 42:13.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.000
Thank you for censoring yourself right at the end there.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.720
Yeah, yeah.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.200
We have like some, it's a martial arts movie,

42:20.200 --> 42:21.240
so there's like amazing,

42:21.240 --> 42:22.920
and we also have like some of the best martial artists

42:22.920 --> 42:24.680
in the world like acting in the movie

42:25.400 --> 42:27.160
who also like happen to be actors.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.840
And so there's some amazing stuff,

42:28.840 --> 42:30.520
but we were kind of just like shocked every day

42:30.520 --> 42:31.880
that these people can do this.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.680
I was watching like Cirque du Soleil

42:34.680 --> 42:35.400
in front of you every day.

42:35.400 --> 42:37.240
Oh yeah, that's radical.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.600
Jesse, as you certainly know,

42:38.600 --> 42:41.160
I am a blue belt in Tae Kwon Do,

42:42.040 --> 42:45.800
and I have to say it is unnerving the extent

42:45.800 --> 42:49.160
to which a lot of your experience,

42:49.160 --> 42:51.640
especially in the early parts of the film,

42:51.640 --> 42:54.200
not so much later as the story unfolds,

42:54.200 --> 42:56.360
but like certainly early on,

42:56.360 --> 42:59.080
it did reflect some of my experience

42:59.080 --> 43:00.440
walking into a martial arts class.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.960
How method did you go for this?

43:01.960 --> 43:04.200
Did you go take some classes

43:04.200 --> 43:06.440
and try to experience that for yourself at all?

43:06.440 --> 43:09.720
Yeah, I had like very strict classes for the movie

43:09.720 --> 43:12.200
because karate in general

43:12.200 --> 43:14.120
is just much more strict than I'm used to.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.280
I was like broken down after 20 minutes.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.120
I mean, it was just incredibly rigorous.

43:18.120 --> 43:19.640
And then I'm only a yellow belt in the movie,

43:19.640 --> 43:20.600
which I kept trying to tell her,

43:20.600 --> 43:22.440
you don't understand, I'm not supposed to be that good.

43:22.440 --> 43:27.080
But she was so intent on making us as good as possible

43:27.080 --> 43:27.960
that it was exhausting.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.320
The only difference in my experience

43:29.320 --> 43:31.720
was that I did have to fight the kids.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.240
I had to spar against the...

43:35.240 --> 43:37.400
There was not an adult white belt class.

43:37.400 --> 43:41.400
The adult white belts fought the child white belts,

43:41.400 --> 43:42.840
so I would spar against children.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.040
Wait, really?

43:44.040 --> 43:46.920
It's the worst possible scenario

43:46.920 --> 43:49.720
because the kids just kick you in the nuts.

43:49.720 --> 43:53.320
It's the only move they know it works 100% of the time.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.720
And there's not a reality of what you could be like,

43:55.720 --> 43:57.880
you know what, I'm gonna punch this kid in the face.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.880
I wanna give him one good slug.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.800
You can't, it's simply not doable.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.320
It's a terrible fight to be in.

44:03.320 --> 44:05.240
This is such a surreal experience to talk to you guys.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.480
It feels like one person is interrupting himself.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.600
It's such a surreal experience.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.880
You've discovered the joke,

44:11.880 --> 44:14.600
the entire conceit of our podcast.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.040
Jesse, this film, The Art of Self-Defense,

44:18.040 --> 44:21.080
it will be in limited release July 12th

44:21.080 --> 44:24.200
and then wider release on July 19th.

44:24.200 --> 44:25.720
Do you think people should see it?

44:25.720 --> 44:26.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:26.600 --> 44:30.040
I mean, this is like my favorite project I've gotten to do,

44:30.040 --> 44:31.960
so I'm so happy I got to do it.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.880
And the reaction to it has been

44:34.920 --> 44:36.760
kind of beyond what we could have imagined.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.440
It was like a kind of modest movie

44:38.440 --> 44:41.080
that is now, by virtue of the movie being really good,

44:41.080 --> 44:44.600
but also by virtue of people talking about masculinity

44:44.600 --> 44:46.920
in the same way the movie talks about it,

44:46.920 --> 44:50.040
it feels like it has some relevant thing to say.

44:50.040 --> 44:55.640
It is a rollercoaster of a film.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.160
Travis was texting me like,

44:57.160 --> 44:58.760
holy shit, I said, did you finish it?

44:58.760 --> 45:01.480
He said, no, I got about 30 minutes until the end.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.360
I was like, you have absolutely no frame of reference

45:04.360 --> 45:07.000
for how wild things are getting.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.680
So Jesse Eisenberg, thank you so much

45:08.680 --> 45:10.280
for coming onto our podcast.

45:10.280 --> 45:11.120
We really appreciate it.

45:11.120 --> 45:11.960
No, thank you.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.800
Thank you so much for having me.

45:13.800 --> 45:14.920
How about a Yahoo?

45:14.920 --> 45:15.720
Yeah.

45:15.720 --> 45:18.200
Okay, this one is from several people sent this in.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.960
Thanks, it's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

45:19.960 --> 45:22.760
who I'm gonna call Leonardo Zapprio.

45:22.760 --> 45:26.600
Who asks, how do I tell my hermit crabs apart?

45:27.240 --> 45:29.320
I got two hermit crabs around the same size

45:29.320 --> 45:31.000
with similar shells, but I can't name them

45:31.000 --> 45:32.200
because I can't tell them apart.

45:33.800 --> 45:34.280
Paint them.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.360
Paint them cool colors.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.080
The shell part or the skin part?

45:40.920 --> 45:42.920
I mean, the shell part, right?

45:42.920 --> 45:43.720
That's gotta be-

45:43.720 --> 45:45.640
But they can change shells, can't they?

45:45.640 --> 45:46.360
That's a good point.

45:46.360 --> 45:47.480
They can swap on you.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.960
You thought you were going on a date with me,

45:49.960 --> 45:52.840
but actually you're going on a date with Paul, the crab.

45:52.840 --> 45:53.480
We switched.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.720
Sorry, Rince.

45:59.880 --> 46:00.600
That's the name.

46:00.600 --> 46:01.640
That name is Rince?

46:01.640 --> 46:04.600
The name of the character is Rince, R-E-N-C-E, Rince.

46:04.600 --> 46:05.080
Okay, cool.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.440
He sounded like a hermit crab owner.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.200
He would wanna date his hermit crabs.

46:10.200 --> 46:14.600
Yeah, I mean, can you get a witch or wizard

46:14.600 --> 46:15.960
to turn you into a hermit crab

46:15.960 --> 46:18.360
and get to know these things a little bit better?

46:18.360 --> 46:19.080
You know what I mean?

46:19.080 --> 46:19.640
Thank you.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.040
Get in.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.120
You could hear their laugh and know them apart instantly.

46:22.120 --> 46:23.960
Yeah, get to know their mannerisms.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.920
Like, oh, he's being a little standoffish.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.840
That must be Rince, too.

46:28.840 --> 46:29.800
Rince Jr., my son.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.320
That must be Rince Jr.

46:31.320 --> 46:34.040
He's the one who prefers romantic comedies

46:34.040 --> 46:40.120
where Paul likes comedies that have an element of romance to them.

46:40.120 --> 46:41.960
Yeah, that's how I tell them apart.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.960
Hermit crab's a strange pet, yes?

46:43.960 --> 46:45.480
It is, it is.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.640
Good if you have too many bugs lying around.

46:47.640 --> 46:48.520
Do they love these things?

46:48.520 --> 46:50.280
But they love bugs.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.880
That's what they eat, are bugs.

46:51.880 --> 46:52.760
Or maybe leaves?

46:53.560 --> 46:55.080
Hermit crabs on leaves, huh?

46:55.080 --> 46:57.160
Alexa, what do hermit crabs eat?

46:57.160 --> 47:00.360
They eat high quality commercial hermit crab food.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.120
That's not at all helpful.

47:02.120 --> 47:05.640
Okay, there's vegetables and non-citrus fruits.

47:06.280 --> 47:11.080
Mangoes, spinach, carrot, coconut, papaya as treats.

47:11.080 --> 47:11.960
Oh, cool, cool.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.920
Yeah, this is turning into sort of a hermit crab

47:15.640 --> 47:17.640
caretaking podcast a little bit.

47:17.640 --> 47:20.040
Not so much one with jokes anymore.

47:20.040 --> 47:23.000
How about like 100%, not a caretaking podcast,

47:23.000 --> 47:27.720
how about 100% complete guide to hermit crab ownership?

47:27.720 --> 47:28.840
I'm done now.

47:28.840 --> 47:32.280
They're seashells that come to life and eat the coconut

47:32.280 --> 47:34.840
that you leave them, end of story.

47:34.840 --> 47:37.080
They are magical wish pets.

47:37.080 --> 47:42.360
Yeah, I think you probably have to get rid of one of them.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.120
If you can't tell them-

47:44.120 --> 47:44.440
Why?

47:44.440 --> 47:47.160
Well, because you can't have two identical hermit crabs.

47:48.040 --> 47:51.160
And to be fair, it's a lot of responsibility.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.440
Two hermit crabs?

47:53.080 --> 47:56.680
A hermit crab, first of all, is like totally fine

47:56.680 --> 47:58.680
if you just set it outside and say like, go with God.

47:58.680 --> 47:59.640
Like they will find their way.

47:59.640 --> 48:02.440
They can eat all, apparently all vegetables,

48:02.440 --> 48:04.600
all non citrus fruits and all bugs.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.360
So like they're gonna find their way downtown.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.000
Don't worry about it.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.600
Something, you know, a big predator comes in,

48:08.600 --> 48:11.880
what, oops, my hard shell can't get in there.

48:11.880 --> 48:14.200
Wait, what are they going downtown for, Griffin?

48:15.640 --> 48:17.560
You know, finding love in the big city.

48:18.200 --> 48:21.080
But anyway, you can't have two identical hermit crabs.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.760
That's like having two dishwashers.

48:22.760 --> 48:24.040
It doesn't make any sense at all.

48:24.680 --> 48:27.560
Do you guys wanna know the red flags of owning a hermit crab?

48:27.560 --> 48:29.320
The things that really should make you sit up

48:29.320 --> 48:30.600
and call your veterinarian and say,

48:30.600 --> 48:32.440
hey, I got a real hermit crab emergency.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.440
I don't think I'll ever need to know this information,

48:34.440 --> 48:37.080
but now that I've said that, I will need it at some point

48:37.080 --> 48:38.680
and feel like a real dickhead.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.040
The first one is lethargy.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.840
You know, this hermit crab used to have a lot of get up and go.

48:45.800 --> 48:48.760
Yeah, now he's dragon ass, he must be dying.

48:49.960 --> 48:53.880
The second one is abandoned shell and doesn't return.

48:53.880 --> 48:57.400
Which, yeah, I would think that would be a huge

48:57.400 --> 49:00.040
red flag since they don't even have an ass,

49:00.040 --> 49:01.000
as far as I know.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.800
And they're just gonna crawl around same shell.

49:04.520 --> 49:05.480
They have no ass.

49:05.480 --> 49:07.240
Here's the last one that they have listed here

49:07.240 --> 49:08.600
at the Petco website.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.040
Loss of limbs.

49:10.040 --> 49:10.600
No shit.

49:10.600 --> 49:11.800
Yeah, these are not good tips.

49:12.840 --> 49:15.160
Really, loss of limbs is a problem.

49:15.160 --> 49:18.680
What are the signs that they're about to become lethargic

49:18.680 --> 49:20.040
and run away and lose their limbs?

49:20.040 --> 49:23.320
Because I need to know the step before that step, ideally.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.920
There is no warning before that.

49:24.920 --> 49:28.360
They just seem chill and happy and then they'll abandon

49:28.360 --> 49:29.000
their shells.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.040
That's life, huh?

49:30.040 --> 49:32.600
I guess, I guess in a way, Griffin, I guess it is.

49:33.160 --> 49:34.520
Hey, I want to do another Yahoo.

49:34.520 --> 49:35.000
Is that okay?

49:36.280 --> 49:36.840
Sure.

49:36.840 --> 49:37.480
Evan sent it in.

49:37.480 --> 49:40.280
It's Yahoo Answers user joez51 who asks,

49:41.000 --> 49:44.200
a hair salon used my cut hair for a wig.

49:44.760 --> 49:47.240
If they sold it without telling me, is that legal?

49:48.280 --> 49:48.780
Huh?

49:50.120 --> 49:51.240
Ooh, okay.

49:51.240 --> 49:51.800
Would you know?

49:51.800 --> 49:54.440
You're walking around downtown looking for love in the big city

49:54.440 --> 49:56.600
and you turn the corner and who greets you?

49:56.600 --> 49:58.680
Ah, it's, how can you be me?

49:58.680 --> 49:59.480
I'm me.

49:59.480 --> 50:01.800
But no, it's just your hair on someone else's head

50:01.800 --> 50:04.440
because you got, your shit got wigged.

50:05.080 --> 50:08.120
I would definitely know and I would definitely love it.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.480
I would love it too and I would definitely know

50:11.480 --> 50:12.680
if it was Travis's.

50:12.680 --> 50:15.640
And I think I could honestly tell if it's Justin's.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.880
My hair is the most nondescript bullshit.

50:17.880 --> 50:21.960
Like, my hair is just like, it's just in the dictionary.

50:21.960 --> 50:24.280
It says hair, it's not fun.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.320
This is hair.

50:25.320 --> 50:25.800
This is hair.

50:25.800 --> 50:29.240
This is the default choice on the character creator.

50:29.240 --> 50:29.880
When you turn it on.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.400
I don't know, there's some hair.

50:31.400 --> 50:33.160
You know how on all the Bethesda games,

50:33.160 --> 50:35.960
like the hair just looks like hair

50:35.960 --> 50:39.480
and there's not much character or excitement to it,

50:39.480 --> 50:42.280
but you can make your dude have hair?

50:42.840 --> 50:44.200
That's kind of what I'm dealing with.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.280
And I don't think that it's going to be recognized.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.200
And I don't think that it's going to be recognizable

50:48.200 --> 50:49.080
in any way.

50:49.080 --> 50:51.640
Yeah, who knows how the hair in video games

50:51.640 --> 50:52.680
when you're in the character creator

50:52.680 --> 50:54.680
always seems to be floating like a half an inch

50:54.680 --> 50:55.800
off their head.

50:55.800 --> 50:56.760
That's kind of like Griffin.

50:56.760 --> 50:58.600
If Griffin turns his head too fast,

50:58.600 --> 50:59.560
his hair doesn't keep up.

50:59.560 --> 51:00.040
It's true.

51:00.920 --> 51:03.640
So would you, but if you saw your hair, Justin,

51:03.640 --> 51:05.480
on the street, on someone else's head,

51:05.480 --> 51:06.120
what'd you do?

51:07.240 --> 51:08.760
This person knows.

51:08.760 --> 51:11.640
Like they're for sure that they saw their hair on a wig.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.400
The question is who has the legal ownership of that hair?

51:15.400 --> 51:20.680
My argument would be if at the end of your hair cutting,

51:20.680 --> 51:22.440
you don't get down on your hands and knees

51:22.440 --> 51:24.280
and scoop it all into a Kroger bag.

51:24.280 --> 51:24.760
Right.

51:24.760 --> 51:30.840
And that is then the legal property of the barber.

51:30.840 --> 51:33.640
Yeah, once it's off your body, man, that's trash.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.960
And another man's trash is another man's treasure

51:35.960 --> 51:36.920
is another man's wig.

51:38.280 --> 51:39.960
That's what they say.

51:39.960 --> 51:41.800
It used to be one of my favorite prank calls

51:41.800 --> 51:45.480
when I was in college to call barbershops

51:45.480 --> 51:49.160
to ask if I could come by and collect all the hair

51:49.160 --> 51:53.480
for an entire day to keep deer out of my vegetable garden

51:53.480 --> 51:54.920
because I had read that that worked.

51:56.360 --> 51:59.640
And it was a very pleasant, there's no punchline to it.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.320
It was just a pleasant conversation

52:01.320 --> 52:04.040
where I would try to see if they would let me come in

52:04.040 --> 52:05.480
and scoop up all the hair.

52:06.600 --> 52:07.640
Cool, man.

52:07.640 --> 52:09.240
And what did they say, Justin?

52:09.240 --> 52:11.560
You've got me on the hook, reel me in.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.240
They wouldn't let you from when I,

52:13.800 --> 52:15.080
a lot of them wouldn't let you.

52:15.080 --> 52:17.880
One guy did suggest that I add a little lime in there.

52:17.880 --> 52:18.920
I remember him saying that.

52:19.560 --> 52:20.760
Maybe if you add a little lime,

52:20.760 --> 52:23.960
that would probably work pretty good to keep the deer out.

52:23.960 --> 52:27.080
Do you think that he meant like the fruit?

52:27.080 --> 52:28.120
Yeah, probably.

52:28.120 --> 52:28.600
I don't know.

52:28.600 --> 52:30.040
Mix some fruit in your human hair.

52:30.040 --> 52:30.520
I don't have it.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.480
I didn't have a real deer problem, actually.

52:33.480 --> 52:35.160
Yeah, Travis, it was a funny sketch.

52:35.160 --> 52:37.240
A funny sketch like Mad TV.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.240
That's how Mad TV found me, actually.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.400
I actually called the Mad TV barber

52:41.400 --> 52:43.320
and he said, I've got to get you in

52:43.320 --> 52:45.960
with Alfred E. Newman and the whole gang.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.360
Hair donation is a thing.

52:48.360 --> 52:49.400
It's cool, right?

52:49.400 --> 52:51.720
And that's a nice thing to do.

52:51.720 --> 52:54.760
I just can't wrap my mind around,

52:57.800 --> 52:59.800
at what point does the hair stop being mine?

53:00.520 --> 53:03.560
Because is all the hair on my head fucking forfeit

53:03.560 --> 53:05.480
from the moment I walk into the barbershop?

53:06.840 --> 53:09.480
I think you have a window before they scoop it up.

53:09.480 --> 53:10.360
That's what I'm saying.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.640
You have a window.

53:11.640 --> 53:14.280
If their broom touches it, it's theirs.

53:14.280 --> 53:16.520
Oh, if you can, no, how about this?

53:16.520 --> 53:19.080
If it touches the floor, it's theirs.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.680
So now it's like you're in one of those

53:20.680 --> 53:23.640
money whirlwind machines at the mall.

53:23.640 --> 53:26.040
And it's like, they're buzzing it, buzzing it fast.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.960
And you're like reaching out with your fucking

53:27.960 --> 53:30.200
great dexterity, snatching all the hair up

53:30.200 --> 53:32.040
and putting it right in your big pocket

53:32.040 --> 53:33.640
or your fanny pack that you've got.

53:33.640 --> 53:34.760
Then they see what you're doing,

53:34.760 --> 53:37.560
start trimming it even faster because they, you know,

53:37.560 --> 53:39.560
they want to get some of that fucking hair.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.600
That's where the money is.

53:41.560 --> 53:43.480
Hello, my name is Travis McElroy,

53:43.480 --> 53:47.160
and I'm here to pitch an invention to you this evening.

53:47.160 --> 53:49.640
It's like an umbrella, but it's upside down

53:49.640 --> 53:51.400
and it fits around your head.

53:52.280 --> 53:55.240
And then when it cuts the hair, it catches in the umbrella,

53:55.240 --> 53:57.240
and then you just walk right out with it.

53:57.960 --> 53:59.640
I need $8 billion.

53:59.640 --> 54:02.520
Yeah, yeah, to turn some umbrellas upside down

54:02.520 --> 54:05.160
and punch holes in them without losing the sort of

54:05.160 --> 54:08.760
umbrella-ness of the machinery inside.

54:08.760 --> 54:10.840
That's what I love the most about that, Travis,

54:10.840 --> 54:14.440
is that you're going to have your own dead ass hair

54:14.440 --> 54:18.280
all over your mouth, chin, and nose for a bit there.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.960
Yes, but it'll be worth it to know

54:22.520 --> 54:24.280
where my hair is at all times.

54:24.280 --> 54:26.760
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy, and I've invented

54:26.760 --> 54:30.280
the 360 degree full wrap around beard.

54:30.280 --> 54:33.160
This, you're going to wear this motherfucker

54:33.160 --> 54:35.080
like a necklace, but it's a beard.

54:35.080 --> 54:39.880
Only loose, and awful, and no food.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.800
No food, forget about food.

54:42.600 --> 54:45.640
I feel like we set a record for introducing ourselves

54:45.640 --> 54:47.480
and each other on this episode.

54:47.480 --> 54:49.880
I feel like this is probably number one

54:49.880 --> 54:52.520
in terms of introductions.

54:52.520 --> 54:57.800
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.440
Thank you so much for listening to the program.

55:01.400 --> 55:03.320
I want to say a huge thank you to

55:03.320 --> 55:05.480
Jesse Eisenberg.

55:05.480 --> 55:07.560
Holy shit, that's wild.

55:07.560 --> 55:08.360
Yeah, that was fun.

55:08.360 --> 55:12.440
Go see The Art of Self-Defense,

55:12.440 --> 55:16.200
and you can see that, I guess, in theaters.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.440
I don't actually know, I should've checked on that.

55:18.440 --> 55:23.000
That's going to be in theaters,

55:23.000 --> 55:26.680
select theaters July 12th, everywhere July 19th,

55:26.680 --> 55:28.440
The Art of Self-Defense.

55:28.440 --> 55:30.600
Go check it totally out.

55:30.600 --> 55:34.120
Thank you to, gosh, John Roderick in The Long Winters

55:34.120 --> 55:35.720
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

55:35.720 --> 55:37.400
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

55:38.600 --> 55:40.840
Cool track, cool track, man.

55:40.840 --> 55:43.080
And thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.280
They have a bunch of great shows

55:44.280 --> 55:47.720
like Beef and Dairy Network, and Reading Glasses,

55:47.720 --> 55:49.240
and Switchblade Sisters.

55:49.240 --> 55:50.600
Check them out, MaximumFun.org,

55:50.600 --> 55:52.680
and we have a bunch of other stuff at McElroy.Family,

55:52.680 --> 55:55.960
including a new Monster Factory episode

55:55.960 --> 55:59.560
that I think is really fun.

55:59.560 --> 56:00.840
It's really funny.

56:00.840 --> 56:01.880
We played a game called Bless,

56:01.880 --> 56:03.880
and holy shit, it turned out wild.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.760
And we have a bunch of new merch, too,

56:06.760 --> 56:09.640
including new Monster Factory merch for the first time.

56:10.360 --> 56:11.320
Very true.

56:11.320 --> 56:13.000
All right, folks, that's going to do it for us.

56:13.960 --> 56:16.760
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo to kind of take us out on?

56:16.760 --> 56:19.560
Yes, let's load that up right now.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.240
This is sent in by Merritt Palmer.

56:21.240 --> 56:21.720
Thank you, Merritt.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.360
It's Yahoo Answers user Lamberto, who asks,

56:24.360 --> 56:27.960
did you cry when your plumber died?

56:33.960 --> 56:35.160
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:35.160 --> 56:36.200
Travis McElroy.

56:36.200 --> 56:37.320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:38.120 --> 56:39.080
This has been my brother, my brother.

56:39.080 --> 56:54.760
And may you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.880
Maximumfun.org.

57:01.880 --> 57:02.920
Comedy and culture.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.040
Artist-owned.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.080
Listener-supported.

57:05.080 --> 57:07.640
Listen, we already know that you love genre movies,

57:07.640 --> 57:09.560
film craft, and female filmmakers.

57:09.560 --> 57:13.000
So if you love all those things, then by transitive property,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.240
you love my podcast, Switchblade Sisters.

57:15.240 --> 57:16.760
Hi, I'm film critic April Wolfe.

57:16.760 --> 57:18.200
Every week, I have a conversation

57:18.200 --> 57:19.560
with a different female filmmaker

57:19.560 --> 57:20.920
about their favorite genre film.

57:20.920 --> 57:22.920
Each episode covers the filmmaking process,

57:22.920 --> 57:25.080
working in the film industry, and just, like,

57:25.080 --> 57:27.160
general geeking out about awesome movies.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.480
I've had such great guests like the big sick writer Emily

57:29.480 --> 57:29.960
Gordon.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.800
To me, indie movies, as of late,

57:31.800 --> 57:33.640
have come to be a catchphrase.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.960
Have come to be a catch-all term for a movie that

57:35.960 --> 57:37.720
kind of defies genre.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.120
Billy Madison and half-fake director Tamra Davis.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.680
When a comedian comes and enters onto my set,

57:42.680 --> 57:45.000
they're just there to be funny.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.640
And we're all ready and waiting for them to be funny.

57:47.640 --> 57:50.200
Horror industry veteran and actor Barbara Crampton.

57:50.200 --> 57:52.120
That's where real drama lies for me.

57:52.120 --> 57:55.240
What's between you and I speaking right now?

57:56.040 --> 57:57.240
Where are we meeting?

57:57.240 --> 57:59.560
And what's the energy that we create between us?

57:59.560 --> 58:00.760
And so many others.

58:00.760 --> 58:02.920
So check out Switchblade Sisters every Thursday
