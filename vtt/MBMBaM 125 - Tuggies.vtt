00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.760
Hello and welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, your advice show for a modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.800
I'm your sweet- Did you want me in it?

00:57.440 --> 01:00.000
Oh, this is awkward. Can I finish?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.760
Go ahead, Griffin.

01:01.760 --> 01:05.440
Well, fuck! Let me loose!

01:08.720 --> 01:09.680
Alright, spit that fire.

01:09.680 --> 01:18.080
I'm gonna fucking- No, it's just not gonna happen now.

01:18.880 --> 01:19.760
Let's cancel the whole show.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.240
Griffin, they gotta know who you are. They gotta know who you are, Griffin.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.080
I'm a baby. Gotta love me.

01:24.080 --> 01:24.480
Sleep in the rain.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.440
You guys dinosaurs?

01:25.440 --> 01:26.000
Topical!

01:26.000 --> 01:31.040
Dinosaurs, it's back. Now, Griffin, you had a little thrilling tale you were gonna tell about a bug.

01:31.040 --> 01:35.120
Skeeto. Got a skeeto in my office. Can't see it, been looking, but I got bite.

01:35.120 --> 01:39.200
I got one bite on my wrist, and I know I'm gonna have like 12 bites by the end of this show.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.720
Open Gotham style!

01:40.720 --> 01:44.720
Okay, so basically all of the possible openings that we discussed.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.040
Travis, do you want to talk about Halloween costumes?

01:47.040 --> 01:50.000
Ooh, spooky scary!

01:50.000 --> 01:56.400
Have you guys heard this Gangnam Style?

01:56.400 --> 01:57.680
Yeah, it's all about plaids.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.320
Gangnam Style.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.840
It's all about tasteful plaids.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.880
There should be an episode of Put This On called Gangnam Style.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.360
Don't you think? That's pretty good, right?

02:07.360 --> 02:12.080
Yeah, I'd say the half-life for that goof is about 13 more minutes.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.120
So if he can possibly, if he can get the crew together real quick.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.080
Squeeze it out.

02:16.080 --> 02:22.240
So here on this program, are you gonna tell your, finish your story about the bug?

02:22.240 --> 02:22.960
I was getting into it.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.320
It literally is, there's a bug in my office, I don't know how to deal with it.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.440
I'm not like bug phobic, but I'm delicious to, delicious to bugs, extra delicious.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.560
You eat too many nanas.

02:33.120 --> 02:33.600
Is that it?

02:34.160 --> 02:35.920
Yeah, mosquitoes, they love bananas.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.920
Right, but do they love, like I turn those bananas into poop pretty quick, so like.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.680
No, you get it in your, in your skin excretions.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.000
Okay, I don't like to, I don't like to think about the fact that I have those.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.800
Wow, that's fair.

02:48.800 --> 02:53.520
Guys, we gotta, I want to get to the advice, but we got a wonderful letter this week.

02:53.520 --> 03:01.280
And it came to us, the letterhead, the envelope is from Canisus College.

03:02.480 --> 03:07.040
And we got an email from a girl named Melina.

03:07.040 --> 03:07.600
Maybe a woman.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.720
Maybe a woman, a woman named Melina.

03:10.720 --> 03:15.280
Well, I said girl because she's just out graduating, but yeah, I guess, I guess woman is correct.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.680
And she sent that to our post office box.

03:17.680 --> 03:22.800
It's PO Box 54 Huntington, West Virginia 25706.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.880
And she, she's a fan of the story who's a sophomore at Canisus College.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.200
And, and she stole an envelope from there to mail us.

03:33.200 --> 03:37.440
And she sent a photo of herself in her, in her cap and gown.

03:37.440 --> 03:41.120
Uh, and she said that we are the reason she is graduating.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.080
That doesn't seem likely.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.840
I mean, that, I don't want to, I don't want to put.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.920
The last part was not true, but everything else.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.080
I don't like putting fans on blast, but that there's no possible way that we

03:51.040 --> 03:56.000
ever aided anyone with any sort of educational progress.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.720
I like, there is someone out there who has slum dog million aired my brother, my brother and me.

04:02.720 --> 04:07.760
There one fucking possible collection of course loads.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.760
Could anyone ever be offered that would touch on the things that we talk about

04:13.200 --> 04:16.160
animal, animal husbandry, specifically geese.

04:16.160 --> 04:16.640
Yeah.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.200
That's one.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.840
What about, didn't we talk about different flavors of cotton candy once?

04:22.480 --> 04:29.120
Yeah, that wasn't sure because why would that ever be part of a collegiate program though?

04:29.120 --> 04:29.840
Clown college.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.920
Yeah, go home.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.280
Let's get to some actual questions.

04:35.280 --> 04:40.800
I want to, as long as we're wasting time, uh, I want to, no, I want to thank, uh,

04:40.800 --> 04:42.240
you had to go back to your bug story.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.120
I want to thank it's, I'm up to two bites.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.240
I got one on my knee.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.600
Like don't worry about it though.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.720
So I want to thank everyone who donated on, on max Funday last week.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.800
We, uh, we did very, very well.

04:52.800 --> 04:58.480
Um, thank you so much to all the donors and our, our, our listener base is now composed

04:58.480 --> 05:01.280
of two groups, donors and boners.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.360
And you know what side you fall on.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.200
That's all I'm going to say on the matter.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.360
Uh, let's here's our first question.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.080
I'm planning on moving into an apartment for the first time soon.

05:10.080 --> 05:16.240
I'm looking around at some apartments and one in particular has apartments available.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.480
If he says apartments again, I'm going to lose it.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.080
Uh, it's such a fun word.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.520
Apartments available on the first floor at the top floor.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.840
My question is, which would be better to move into?

05:27.840 --> 05:30.400
My friends seem split on the decision.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.360
So I think some insight from MB and BAM is needed.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.040
That's from occupying Ontario.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.520
It's the easiest question ever.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.400
It's the bottom.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.320
It's of course the bottom floor.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.200
A hundred percent.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.720
It's like, do you want to walk an extra?

05:46.720 --> 05:50.880
Think about like all of the times that you're going to have to negotiate those stairs.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.800
Like, do you want to walk a hundred miles for no reason?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.320
No, of course you don't.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.240
And it may seem, you may think like I've only have to move in and out once,

06:01.120 --> 06:03.600
but that one time, man, Griffin and I,

06:03.600 --> 06:07.200
we lived on a third floor apartment when we first moved to Cincinnati

06:07.200 --> 06:09.600
and getting our sofa and chairs and shit up.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.800
It was a two day job.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.080
It was fucking miserable.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.480
That was the worst.

06:14.480 --> 06:14.720
Yeah.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.320
And also if you live on the ground floor,

06:16.320 --> 06:19.440
it's so much easier for people to find your apartment without like wandering through the

06:19.440 --> 06:21.520
building trying to find where you live.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.080
Also, do you know how Dr. Adkins died?

06:24.080 --> 06:26.080
Slipped on some stairs, fell right down.

06:26.080 --> 06:26.800
Him and died.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.040
And then the world got super fat again.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.280
So just things to keep in mind.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.800
The only upside to the top floor is you get some sweet, sweet balcony action.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.720
Another benefit is that if the apartment catches on fire,

06:40.720 --> 06:42.000
then you're definitely going to die.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.680
So that's another bonus.

06:45.680 --> 06:51.840
Again, we are in a situation where more information is necessary.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.120
So like, notice he says top floor, right?

06:55.120 --> 06:55.280
Yeah.

06:56.320 --> 07:00.560
Now, is top floor like up five flights of stairs?

07:00.560 --> 07:01.360
Bad.

07:01.360 --> 07:07.920
Or is it like 30th floor, throw open the window to the balcony,

07:07.920 --> 07:10.640
Jay-Z, run this city, 30th floor.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.000
Are you thinking like helicopter landing pad on the top of the building?

07:14.000 --> 07:14.560
Exactly.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.400
Are we talking like by top floor, do you mean the penthouse?

07:18.400 --> 07:21.200
I like to think that this person has enough

07:21.200 --> 07:24.800
goddamn sense in their head that they wouldn't have to ask us like,

07:24.800 --> 07:29.760
should I live in the sweet Las Vegas playboy penthouse

07:29.760 --> 07:32.800
or in this prison cell in the basement?

07:33.440 --> 07:37.360
I also would like to think since this person is moving into their first apartment,

07:37.360 --> 07:39.760
that this is not like a blank check type situation

07:39.760 --> 07:41.520
where he's just been handed a million dollars.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.800
He's like, I guess I'm taking that swank apartment up on the top.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.960
But the alternate, I mean, the alternate to the situation you're describing,

07:48.960 --> 07:52.560
Griffin, is that this is a person who cannot tell the difference

07:52.560 --> 07:56.880
for whom stairs or no stairs is a binary choice

07:56.880 --> 08:01.600
that you can actually decide on rather than a self-evident truth.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.520
Of course, you don't want stairs.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.400
Sure, stairs.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.080
But maybe the top floor is bigger.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.680
Maybe the downstairs apartment is a smaller apartment.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.200
Because what kind of fucking top heavy building do you think this is?

08:13.200 --> 08:17.200
No, I'm saying that maybe it's like a house that's been converted to apartments

08:17.200 --> 08:19.680
and like the downstairs is two and the upstairs is one.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.440
I'm just saying that there are factors here in which it may not be as straightforward,

08:23.440 --> 08:25.600
but I still stand by that it is straightforward

08:25.600 --> 08:27.920
and the answer is always the bottom floor.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.680
Obviously the bottom floor, it's going to be nice.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.320
It depends.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.240
No, it doesn't.

08:32.240 --> 08:36.480
It does because my first apartment ever was in the West Virginia building,

08:36.480 --> 08:38.000
the tallest building in Huntington, West Virginia.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.520
I was on the 13th.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.520
That's actually the coal exchange building we're going on.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.640
I was in the, why are you going to put me on blast?

08:44.640 --> 08:48.720
Just, well, I mean, if you're just going to fucking spit a bunch of nonsense.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.080
I was on the 13th floor.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.640
We played, we rochambeaued to decide who got the rooms.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.920
There was one very small room with a painted shut window,

08:55.920 --> 08:59.600
one slightly larger room with no windows whatsoever.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.520
And then another room on the corner of the 13th,

09:03.520 --> 09:07.520
like all windowed walls looking out like the pimpest view of the city ever.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.560
And we had to rochambeau for it and I won fortunately.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.320
And it was like a totally sweet, it was a totally sweet deal.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.560
You could look out on all of Huntington's splendor.

09:16.560 --> 09:17.760
That was kind of nice.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.400
That was worth the minute and a half long elevator trip up and down.

09:23.200 --> 09:27.360
I think that there does come a certain point where you pass like fourth floor

09:27.360 --> 09:30.000
and it gets to be like, well, now the height is just awesome.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I would say more than fourth.

09:32.000 --> 09:32.960
I would say eighth.

09:32.960 --> 09:33.680
10 floors.

09:35.200 --> 09:35.760
At least.

09:35.760 --> 09:40.480
I mean, think about the look on your nana's face when she says,

09:40.480 --> 09:45.920
when she says, listen, occupying Ontario, I want you to take my sleeper sofa.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.480
And you say, thanks, thanks, num nums.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.560
That's what he calls his grandma.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.160
And I want you to take my sleeper sofa.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.680
And then you just have to sit there, sit it on her lawn,

09:55.680 --> 09:58.480
pretend like you're taking it and sit it on her lawn and burn it.

09:58.480 --> 09:58.980
Yeah.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.800
You have to do that because you can't take it into your new apartment.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.280
Because if you've ever tried to move a sleeper sofa,

10:05.280 --> 10:08.000
it's the worst period at all.

10:08.000 --> 10:08.640
Try to do it.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.480
Period. At all. Try to do it.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.240
You know that it is not anything anybody would ever want to move ever.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.840
Sure. And also the fire, the fire thing is pretty bad.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.000
Just keep in mind the fire thing.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.480
And the other thing about sleeper sofas is I don't think I've ever opened one up

10:24.480 --> 10:25.920
where there's not something in there.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.520
Yeah. Cheerios.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.840
Cheerios and Snickers wrappers.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.920
Like a highlighter in there for some reason.

10:31.920 --> 10:32.960
There's a Highlifes.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.880
There's a Highlifes.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.960
Somebody was reading about Goofus and Gallant in there.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.880
I don't know, it's a flashlight.

10:40.880 --> 10:41.600
They made a tent.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.480
Did you guys know that the blank check house is here in Austin, Texas?

10:47.120 --> 10:47.680
No.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.400
Yeah, it is.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.680
Did you guys also know that in that film,

10:51.680 --> 10:55.360
he bought a fucking mansion for less than a million dollars?

10:56.720 --> 10:57.040
Yes.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.720
A million dollars was the sum total of money that the child had.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.400
And he bought literally everything in the world.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.640
Okay, okay, but wait a minute.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.360
But wait a minute.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.920
So we're talking about blank check.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.360
They're talking about a mansion.

11:13.360 --> 11:18.560
Is the mansion, in the theory of the story, is the mansion in Austin?

11:19.360 --> 11:21.680
I don't know that the film was set in Austin

11:21.680 --> 11:25.600
because they go to an amusement park and I don't think there's anything really nearby.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.480
There's some shit down in New Bromfels,

11:28.480 --> 11:32.320
but I don't think they would go to New Bromfels in the fiction.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.680
In the fiction, they wouldn't go to New Bromfels.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.440
He fucking hired fat, fake John Candy to drive him around.

11:41.440 --> 11:45.200
Like that would cost more than a million dollars nowadays.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.600
To pay a fat, fake John Candy to be your butt.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.360
He had like a wall of like 30 TVs, right?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.680
Yeah, that's at least a cool three mil.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.840
And he had like a slide installed in his house.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.480
Yeah, that's 20 mil right there.

11:58.480 --> 12:02.320
And like a virtual reality chair and like a big bouncy ball thing.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.360
Like what the fuck?

12:03.360 --> 12:04.160
Yeah.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.360
What kind of discount place is he buying all this shit from?

12:08.480 --> 12:10.720
Got it on Craigslist.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.280
If you're looking at New Bromfels right now,

12:13.280 --> 12:21.520
I can get you into like a nice six bed, seven bath on Park Road.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.320
And that's gonna cost you 1.4 million and that's not even-

12:24.320 --> 12:25.200
That's not even counting-

12:25.200 --> 12:25.840
That's not even a-

12:25.840 --> 12:29.040
Fucking water slide, it's not counting the expensive date

12:29.040 --> 12:33.120
with the woman who kind of looked like more famous women of the era.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.680
And also you can't hire fat, fake John Candy to be your best friend forever.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.480
Just can't do it.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.520
Not for that kind of money.

12:40.240 --> 12:46.160
If that movie was called 200 blank checks and then you got a mil on each of them,

12:46.160 --> 12:47.520
maybe we could talk.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.560
Maybe we could talk.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.480
But hold on.

12:50.480 --> 12:57.520
I wanna give you some perspective and this is very indicative of how our economy has gone.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.840
A million dollars in 1994 equals $1.5 million now.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.120
Not even close though.

13:07.120 --> 13:07.920
Not even close.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.920
How are things by the way?

13:09.920 --> 13:14.160
How is your economy that inflation is that fast?

13:14.160 --> 13:14.880
That's crazy.

13:14.880 --> 13:15.920
That's rough and tumble.

13:15.920 --> 13:22.480
But it's even still, do you think that fake Sinbad would threaten to kill a child for $1.5 million?

13:22.480 --> 13:26.160
Do you mean Tone Loke, Griffin?

13:26.720 --> 13:29.200
Sorry Griffin, do you mean Tone Loke, you bigot?

13:29.680 --> 13:31.840
Because I believe Sinbad is fake Tone Loke.

13:31.840 --> 13:32.640
I got him switched.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.160
I think if you check the math-

13:34.160 --> 13:35.120
I did it bad.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.240
He did a wrong job.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.760
I don't mean to make this a fucking-

13:39.760 --> 13:41.680
The unofficial blank check cast.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.280
What I'm saying is that the whole movie is horseshit.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.760
And I would like to talk about it for about 40 more minutes.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.480
Is he- but okay, but is he leasing?

13:51.200 --> 13:51.680
Oh.

13:53.440 --> 13:58.480
I want to read another question, but Travis, do you have two in a row from Ontario?

13:59.040 --> 14:00.000
Apparently I do.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.920
I like that.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.440
Are we sure it's not from the same person?

14:03.440 --> 14:04.800
Yeah, it's different people.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.300
Okay.

14:06.080 --> 14:06.960
Oh, this is good.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.120
We should save this for next week, but I'm just gonna go ahead and-

14:09.120 --> 14:12.400
This is a teaser to get more of the same.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.240
I want to snap into this particular Slim Jim.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.760
I work in a haunted building.

14:16.560 --> 14:21.200
It used to be a hospital, which has since been turned into a retirement home.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.360
Many of the employees have encountered weird things like whispering in the ear

14:25.360 --> 14:28.560
when they're alone and see reflections in the glass and no one's behind them.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.800
Even to the extreme of an employee getting thrown against the wall, which somebody saw.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.720
The problem is that I don't believe in any of that stuff, but I want to.

14:37.520 --> 14:42.720
How can I convince whatever is haunting my work to prove they exist to me?

14:42.720 --> 14:47.200
Prove they exist to me. That's from one to believe in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.040
You gotta fuck in that hospital.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.920
You gotta get high.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.480
You've got to have sex.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.440
You've got to curse and you've got to be black.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.240
And I think you gotta say things like, oh no, that's just a legend.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.840
That's just a legend.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.320
If you do these things, the killer will reveal themselves to you.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.760
If you say stuff like, I'm just one day away from retirement.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.000
Uh huh. Yes, that's a good way.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.880
From hospital work.

15:14.240 --> 15:14.480
Yes.

15:15.280 --> 15:19.200
If you say, I hope no one eats this ghost food I laid out,

15:20.240 --> 15:20.880
then that is a pretty sure way to get them.

15:20.880 --> 15:26.400
Now specifically, Justin, can you, because I know that you had a brief ghost hunter phase.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.080
What is the, what kind of food, what kind of food are we talking about?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.960
Okay, well, ghost combos.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.840
Is that the ghost of combos or combos of combos?

15:37.840 --> 15:40.000
So when you eat combos.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.640
Okay, so you get a bowl, you fill it with combos.

15:42.640 --> 15:42.960
Okay.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.520
You eat all the combos in that bowl.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.080
Sure.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.160
It's the ghost of combos.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.640
But you gotta make sure that you leave the combos there long enough

15:50.640 --> 15:51.760
for the energy to soak into the area.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.200
Sure, the spectral residue from these combos.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.360
How come that's not on the fucking bag of ingredients?

15:57.360 --> 16:00.240
What if my kid's allergic to spectral combo residue?

16:01.440 --> 16:02.960
Thanks for nothing, General Mills.

16:02.960 --> 16:03.440
My kid's dead.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.240
The other important thing is you have to eat them as violently as possible

16:06.240 --> 16:08.080
to be sure to leave behind the spirit.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.120
Right, it's best if they have an unrequited love too.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.440
They need some sort of unfinished business.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.320
One of the combos is maybe gonna go to college, you know, something like that.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.360
Man, fuck.

16:18.400 --> 16:26.000
Oh my God, guys, I, on a whim, I have just searched for ghost equipment on Amazon.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.480
And now I'm off to the races.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.920
Darn it, because that is-

16:29.920 --> 16:32.400
Oh, golly, this is a new thing.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.320
To afford your new ghost hunting equipment,

16:34.320 --> 16:36.720
are you gonna pawn your fushigi balls?

16:36.720 --> 16:40.560
Do you just hove from one dumb thing to another?

16:41.360 --> 16:46.080
I think my, I feel like my skill in the art of fushigi is,

16:46.080 --> 16:50.560
or as we call it, contact juggling, is really about to blossom.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.200
Do you think that you could use your fushigi to attract ghosts?

16:54.480 --> 16:56.640
I thought my shit was cool, but what are you doing?

16:56.640 --> 16:59.920
Yeah, then I'm haunted by the ghost of my dignity.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.360
It was there and then it disappeared as I fushigi'd.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.000
When I suggested that you fuck at your place of business,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.720
first of all, it's just a great idea, because it feels great to do it.

17:08.720 --> 17:12.560
But more importantly, ghosts are real dirty, which we've discussed many times.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.640
And so if you get down, then a ghost is gonna wanna come by,

17:17.200 --> 17:20.160
see what's happening, maybe try to participate.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.080
I mean, you catch them in a dreamcatcher.

17:22.080 --> 17:26.000
You catch them in a dreamcatcher, like in the movie Dreamcatcher or something.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.840
Hey guys, next week, let's make our entire show about ghosts.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.160
Okay, everybody send your ghost questions.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.840
Do you have ghost questions or do you have a terrifically spooky tale

17:35.840 --> 17:37.440
of when you were haunted by a ghost?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.320
I'm getting spooked just thinking about it.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.440
And we'll tell you about how we used to get drunk in an old asylum.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.560
We'll tell you about the creepy warehouse where they used to store

17:49.600 --> 17:51.760
the pink Cadillac that our dad drove for work.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.480
And now it's a 7-Eleven.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.160
Man, I'm getting scared just thinking about it.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.120
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo!

17:59.120 --> 18:00.240
Sure, I have a few.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.160
This one was sent in by Justin Brown.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.120
Thank you, Justin.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.120
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark.

18:05.120 --> 18:09.600
I'm starting to think Question Mark is not an actual, like, legit Yahoo Answer name.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.280
Maybe it's like, if your Yahoo Answer name is like real, like racist or offensive,

18:13.280 --> 18:15.360
they just, they switch it out.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.920
Instead of that, can you just start saying The Riddler?

18:17.920 --> 18:20.800
This one was sent in by The Riddler.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.300
Thanks.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.120
Thanks, The Riddler.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.240
No, Yahoo Answers User Question Mark asks,

18:26.240 --> 18:31.360
Yahoo Answers User Question Mark asks, how do I become like Dog the Bounty Hunter?

18:33.200 --> 18:35.600
I am a big fan of Dog the Bounty Hunter.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.280
Would love to go around catching bad guys and hauling them to jail.

18:39.280 --> 18:43.040
Would I need to immigrate to America or could I do this in the UK?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.440
What weapons am I allowed to have?

18:45.440 --> 18:48.240
Can I drive faster, do the job?

18:50.640 --> 18:55.920
Wouldn't you love if he came to America illegally and Dog had to be sent after him?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.920
And at the same time, he was hunting Dog.

18:57.920 --> 18:58.800
I learned it from watching you, Dog.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.480
I learned it from watching you.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.120
I just went to Bounty Hut and there's nothing in Bounty Hut in the UK.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.560
It's just this 12-year-old kid with a mullet and a leather vest.

19:09.760 --> 19:15.840
Let's go down the extensive list of reasons why you'd have to move to America to do this job.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.440
The extensive list.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.880
A, there is absolutely no crime in the UK.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.080
Nothing behind.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.440
Way more crime here.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.000
B.

19:26.000 --> 19:26.960
Way more crime.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.840
No, you can't have weapons in the UK, you goose.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.340
Nope.

19:31.040 --> 19:31.540
No.

19:31.760 --> 19:32.560
No, that's a big problem.

19:32.560 --> 19:37.280
Do you think you can just walk down the street with a big can of bear mace in the yuck?

19:37.280 --> 19:37.840
You can't.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.340
Nope.

19:38.800 --> 19:49.360
Now, I do want to point out that Dog the Bounty Hunter is legally barred from entering the UK

19:49.360 --> 19:56.880
because of a slight, mild case of a murder conviction in 1976.

19:56.880 --> 19:57.680
Wait, really?

19:59.040 --> 19:59.760
Yes.

19:59.760 --> 20:05.840
So you could corner the market in the UK because Dog cannot come there and chomp your flavor.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.360
Okay, did you just Google Dog the Bounty Hunter UK or did you just know that?

20:13.360 --> 20:14.640
That's just something I know.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.320
He killed somebody.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.360
Your brain is a horrifying place.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.360
This just happened, well no, it just happened in August.

20:19.360 --> 20:28.320
They wanted him to be on Celebrity Big Brother over there and he couldn't because he has a murder conviction.

20:28.320 --> 20:28.820
Cool.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.560
Is it cool, Travis?

20:31.120 --> 20:31.520
Cool.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.320
No, it's cool in that not cool kind of way.

20:34.320 --> 20:34.880
Oh, I see.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.560
Oh, okay.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.440
I get you.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.080
I get you.

20:38.080 --> 20:43.360
Suddenly, my whole understanding of what Dog the Bounty Hunter stands for is just ripped apart.

20:43.360 --> 20:54.960
Okay, I am Dog the Bounty Hunter or rather a knockoff, a wannabe Dog the Bounty Hunter.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.400
My name is Dog with two Gs.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.600
Dog, oh, okay.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.440
My name is Rough Pup and I'm here to take you down.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.480
That's my catchphrase.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.840
Oh no, Rough Pup's here.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.600
Stop all the crime, quick.

21:07.600 --> 21:18.640
Quick, so anyway, I show up and I have to hit a man repeatedly with a bat to stop his crime that he's doing.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.560
Cops show up, how does this shake out?

21:23.440 --> 21:24.160
This scenario.

21:24.160 --> 21:30.480
They walk in on this scenario and they see what I've done.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.840
What's the result?

21:31.840 --> 21:39.760
I think that you probably, before you're able to bounty hunt, have to go through some sort of training course or course.

21:39.760 --> 21:45.280
Okay, but in this, let's just say in this fiction, I have no fucking interest in doing that.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.120
I think you have to also kill the cops.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.320
Uh oh.

21:48.320 --> 21:48.880
Yikes.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.800
Yeah, and then everything spirals.

21:52.800 --> 22:09.280
I went to a private college via financial aid and so after graduating now, I have a lot of friends with rich parents who love having dinner with their children and me, oftentimes at restaurants that are expensive for my low salary.

22:10.320 --> 22:13.520
100% of the time, they end up paying for the meal.

22:13.520 --> 22:17.680
But if there's any doubt about whether they will, I get uncomfortable when the check comes.

22:17.680 --> 22:22.560
I used to fumble with my wallet, pretend that I was going to pay my share, but that got really uncomfortable.

22:22.560 --> 22:25.360
Is it okay to just ignore the bill completely?

22:25.360 --> 22:27.600
That's from not Ann Landers in New York.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.800
I used to do that.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.960
I used to do that game where I get out my wallet.

22:30.960 --> 22:34.560
Where do I keep, where do I keep the fucking money in here?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.000
This wallet's so big.

22:38.160 --> 22:42.240
I know I left some, I slid some into a side compartment.

22:44.240 --> 22:51.360
No, I mean, I don't, I think that's a little insulting actually to, like, people are onto that game.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.280
They're crafty because they have money.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.320
They know how it works.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.880
They had to be tricksy to get that fortune in the first place.

22:58.880 --> 23:03.520
If people want to pay for dinner, like they, part of the thing with paying for dinner is you feel like,

23:04.240 --> 23:08.480
you know, you feel like a superior, like a champ.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.480
You feel like you're taking care of people.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.280
Good rule of thumb, like very rarely will someone be like,

23:13.280 --> 23:15.840
hey, I want you to, I want to take you to dinner.

23:15.840 --> 23:19.440
And then when you get there, like you're going to pay for your own stuff, right?

23:19.440 --> 23:22.640
Like, I don't know that that's ever happened to me.

23:22.640 --> 23:26.800
I used to feel the same way and be like, oh, suddenly I feel like, should I ask?

23:26.800 --> 23:27.520
Should I bring it up?

23:27.520 --> 23:28.400
Will they tell me?

23:29.200 --> 23:30.720
Just be cool.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.080
And if they ask you out to dinner, then they're probably paying for it.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.560
But it's not, you can't give them the definite.

23:36.560 --> 23:41.920
I think, I think if you don't, if paying for it is not an option,

23:41.920 --> 23:46.240
you got to go with the full bluff and you got to take the check and you got to say,

23:46.240 --> 23:48.000
guys, don't, don't worry about it.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.840
I'll get this one.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.960
And then you get your little reading glasses out.

23:52.960 --> 23:53.760
Oh my God.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.320
Yes, yes.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.040
Tip calculator.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.840
If you have a tip calculator in your wallet, that would be the only way.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.160
I think 30% on this one.

24:00.160 --> 24:00.480
What do you guys think?

24:00.480 --> 24:03.920
If you don't consider the bill, then you're not doing the bluff correctly.

24:03.920 --> 24:08.800
If you don't put on a little green visor and, and really, really crunch some numbs,

24:08.800 --> 24:10.800
then you, they're not going to buy it.

24:10.800 --> 24:17.040
Of course, that bluff, that barrel will go over the waterfall, maybe once.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.880
And then you're in a whole heap of trouble.

24:19.920 --> 24:20.960
It is good though.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.560
I wish they paid the bill first.

24:24.560 --> 24:29.840
I wish that was the first thing you did because it makes it, or decided on that at least.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.680
Cause it makes, it would make ordering a lot easier.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.480
Justin, I...

24:32.480 --> 24:34.480
Cause that's always a high pressure situation.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.120
Cause if you know somebody else is paying, you know.

24:37.120 --> 24:44.000
I fucking love this idea more than any other idea we've ever generated.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.680
I love the idea of a restaurant you show up to and you say, bring me $50 of food.

24:50.240 --> 24:50.720
And then they...

24:51.440 --> 24:52.240
You know what?

24:52.240 --> 24:52.880
No shit.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.520
There's the restaurant that I just went to yesterday.

24:55.520 --> 25:00.720
There's an option on the menu that basically you pay $25 and they just bring you some courses.

25:00.720 --> 25:01.760
I love it.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.360
Like it's chef's choice.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.240
And it's just like, you pay 25 bucks and the chef...

25:06.240 --> 25:08.320
That's good also for when you're drunk.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.040
Yeah.

25:09.040 --> 25:09.680
I don't know.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.280
I'm just going to chew for a while.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.840
Hopefully by the end of it, I will be full.

25:15.840 --> 25:21.200
I also think that, man, maybe you should offer to pay, you know?

25:21.840 --> 25:22.640
How often are these people taking you out?

25:22.640 --> 25:25.600
No, I don't think, I don't think you should offer to pay.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.200
I think you should be gracious.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.320
Oh, definitely.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.440
I think that's a much more, I mean, like that's the better part of it.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.320
It's goofy and a little insulting because, okay.

25:34.320 --> 25:41.200
If you're a wealthy parent and you're taking your kid and their friends out for dinner,

25:41.920 --> 25:44.800
part of the reason you're doing that is because it'll make you feel good.

25:44.800 --> 25:49.280
So if you are at dinner and one of your kid's torpy friends, it's like,

25:49.280 --> 25:53.200
wow, let me see what my portion is of that, Mrs. Jonas.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.440
Then you're going to think, well, what do you think of me?

25:55.440 --> 25:59.840
Do you think I need help buying your fucking French dip sandwich for $7.99?

25:59.840 --> 26:00.640
Because I don't.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.360
See, this is why your waiter always be on point

26:03.360 --> 26:07.280
and always ask how to do the checks.

26:07.280 --> 26:12.880
A savvy waiter, first thing, will say, and have you never seen that before?

26:12.880 --> 26:14.960
I have, but not at a high class restaurant.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.960
It depends on the establishment.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.960
If you have more than four people.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.880
Dodge happens right at the beginning, it's nice.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.240
Yeah, except, oh, I don't eat at TGI Fridays.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.040
You know what I mean?

26:25.040 --> 26:27.120
Like I'm not a booby Tuesdays.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.720
If it has the name of a day of a weekend.

26:28.720 --> 26:33.120
You have just listed the two restaurants I've eaten at in the last two weeks.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.040
Excellent, excellent.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.400
In the correct order as well.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.960
That must be easy if you live in Austin.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.560
Like every restaurant serves delicious Tex-Mex food

26:42.560 --> 26:45.440
and is in a giant dinosaur or something equally kitchen.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.160
All the meals are served.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.400
Here in Cincinnati, it's all TGI Fridays.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.480
All the meals are served out of mason jars.

26:51.280 --> 26:55.280
Yeah, welcome to slurpers.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.720
The whole restaurant's lit with different novelty Christmas lights.

26:58.720 --> 27:03.520
That's actually, that one's actually not far off.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.720
Um, listen, I love this restaurant.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.720
Listen, I don't think it's a restaurant.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.480
I think that we've wandered into someone's attic.

27:12.720 --> 27:13.600
I'm trying to eat.

27:13.600 --> 27:18.240
I'm trying to eat the, uh, it's a boy bubblegum cigars that they flipped.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.840
This saved as a keepsake.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.080
Don't also, we might be raccoons.

27:22.080 --> 27:29.680
Welcome to the best comedy advice cast

27:29.680 --> 27:34.000
that is hosted and performed exclusively by raccoons.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.920
For raccoons, by raccoons.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.480
People are so surprised when we go to live shows.

27:38.480 --> 27:45.440
They can't see us skinning around and rummaging through purses.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.840
People are always so surprised that it turns out we're raccoons this whole time.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.600
Every time I take raccoons out for dinner,

27:51.600 --> 27:54.160
there's always that awkward moment where they realize they're raccoons.

27:54.160 --> 27:54.660
Yeah.

27:54.660 --> 27:55.840
And that they don't have wallets.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.340
Yeah.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.000
It's adorable, but I mean, I feel bad for them.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.560
So you really don't, you're ordering garbage again.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.040
Okay, again.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.920
You're ordering, every time I take you out.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.440
We could have just gone to Slurper's.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.440
You either get the buffalo chicken sandwich or garbage.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.440
It's the only two things I've ever heard you order.

28:13.440 --> 28:25.280
Is it bad form to offer these parents maybe a tug?

28:25.280 --> 28:28.800
As you're leaving, like, hey, Greg, do appreciate the vittles.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.080
I will hit you on the tug.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.680
You name the time and place.

28:35.600 --> 28:39.440
I will get that tug right out the door, right to you.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.720
Please, not Sunday morning.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.160
That's when I go to church.

28:42.160 --> 28:47.120
Yeah, dude, unless I am at church, I am tug ready.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.720
You just say the word.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.160
I will handle the gratuity, if you know what I mean.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.680
You know what I mean, and I think you do.

28:57.840 --> 29:01.440
I think it's a little, I think it could be perceived as slightly,

29:01.440 --> 29:07.040
not, I mean, I don't necessarily think it's polite to offer to split the tip.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.080
I think it's polite.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.760
Well, no, God, not during a tug.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.200
That would be Jesus.

29:11.200 --> 29:15.840
That would be horrific.

29:15.840 --> 29:16.800
Who would want that?

29:18.880 --> 29:21.120
You're into some weird stuff, Danny's dad.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.200
But man, that French tip was good.

29:25.200 --> 29:32.800
So I guess, hey, unless you want us to split the tip,

29:32.800 --> 29:43.920
then we're going to need to go to the Money Zone.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.960
So welcome to the Money Zone.

29:48.960 --> 29:52.560
As you know, we've been sponsored by Extreme Restraints for the last couple of weeks.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.440
And we also-

29:53.440 --> 29:55.440
By couple of weeks, you mean 14, right?

29:55.440 --> 29:58.800
For the last 28 weeks, we've been sponsored by Extreme Restraints.

29:58.800 --> 30:03.760
We received an email from Allie, who works in the warehouse at ExtremeRestraints.com.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.400
And she is an avid My Brother, My Brother, Me listener.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.920
And she just wanted to let us know that hearing our spots for the company

30:09.920 --> 30:14.080
that she works for for the last two months has filled her with nothing but joy and pleasure.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.480
And her heart is warmed by this partnership.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.960
And thanks for being hilarious and fun with your ads

30:18.960 --> 30:21.120
and overall supporting this great website.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.240
I'm proud to be synonymous with My Brother, My Brother, Me.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.200
Try it again.

30:25.200 --> 30:25.840
Synonymous.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.040
There we go.

30:27.040 --> 30:27.760
Thank you.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.120
Yours and Allie's.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.800
So Allie, thank you so much.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.560
And now we're going to talk about bonus and stuff.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.680
You know, that email warms my heart.

30:37.680 --> 30:43.840
But if I want my scrotum warmed, I go with the Mini Remote Control 10 Function Egg.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.120
I don't-

30:45.120 --> 30:46.800
That's a remote sex toy.

30:46.800 --> 30:47.920
I've been fucking up.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.960
So, because I just put like a towel on there and then I like shoot.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.080
That's that old shit.

30:52.080 --> 30:55.840
I put a towel right on it and then I use the hairdryer right on there.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.720
Yeah, watch out for that because you'll dry and crack.

30:59.280 --> 30:59.520
Yeah.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.120
Jesus.

31:01.120 --> 31:01.360
What?

31:02.160 --> 31:02.400
You know-

31:02.400 --> 31:02.800
I want to-

31:04.240 --> 31:04.560
Listen.

31:05.280 --> 31:05.840
Listen.

31:05.840 --> 31:06.960
It's my birthday.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.880
I'm trying to treat my balls right.

31:08.880 --> 31:09.200
Uh-huh.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.960
What else is there for me on this one- on this website?

31:13.680 --> 31:16.000
Well, how would you- how would you like-

31:17.120 --> 31:21.280
There are some really good jewelry actually that I'm just now seeing.

31:21.280 --> 31:21.760
Oh, that's nice.

31:21.760 --> 31:24.080
I've never dipped into the jewelry before.

31:24.080 --> 31:28.240
There's one that looks like a snake is coming out of your wiener.

31:28.240 --> 31:28.740
Ooh.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.200
When you say- now when you say jewelry that makes it look like a snake is coming out of

31:33.200 --> 31:34.960
my wiener, are we talking about like a brooch?

31:35.760 --> 31:37.040
Are we talking about like a pendant?

31:37.920 --> 31:38.800
Let me tell you what we're talking about.

31:38.800 --> 31:43.200
Is this like one of those brooches that has like an old lady on it and it's like ivory?

31:43.200 --> 31:44.640
It looks like- you know what I mean?

31:44.640 --> 31:45.120
Like ceramic-

31:45.120 --> 31:51.680
No, it looks like some sort of weird Return to Oz metal snake robot is crawling out of

31:51.680 --> 31:52.880
your penis hole.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.960
So not like a lady reading a book.

31:54.960 --> 31:59.760
Justin has just forwarded me the picture and it is in fact a picture of a dick as well.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.440
I guess I should have assumed that.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.000
Hey, hold on let me see this pic.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I just sent my brother a picture of a dick.

32:04.000 --> 32:04.960
Must be Sunday.

32:05.920 --> 32:09.120
I guess I should have assumed it was just a picture of a dick.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.320
Rachel, you gotta see this.

32:13.360 --> 32:18.720
So extremetraits.com is your super store for adult novelties.

It's a ring that looks like a dick.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.960
Like a snake's coming out of a dick.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.840
Do you think they custom fit it?

32:33.840 --> 32:37.440
Like a snake, but it's coming out of the dick hole and it's like wrapping around.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.600
Anyway, go to extremetraits.com, spelled just like it sounds, and use the coupon code MIDDLIST

32:43.600 --> 32:44.880

32:44.880 --> 32:50.560
And thank you so much, Extremetraits, for sticking with us for all these weeks.

32:50.560 --> 32:59.120
It is one of the few sponsor program relationships I know of where the fans actually look forward

32:59.120 --> 33:01.440
to the ads and demand that they continue.

33:02.320 --> 33:07.600
We've heard from people specifically saying, I hope you never stop being sponsored by Extremetraits.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.200
They are rooting for advertising.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.160
So thank you to them and thank you to you guys for being so cool.

33:12.160 --> 33:17.360
I think, I can't speak for them, but I think this shit's for life, you know what I mean?

33:17.360 --> 33:19.280
Yeah, I think we've got something real here.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.320
I think we're BFFs.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.520
I look forward to these ads too.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.440
I did not know you could come as snake.

33:23.440 --> 33:23.920
Didn't know?

33:24.960 --> 33:33.280
I remember when this relationship first blossomed, we got an email from Teresa Thorn, basically

33:33.280 --> 33:38.480
to see like, I didn't know if you guys would be okay with this or if this would be the

33:38.480 --> 33:44.160
sort of thing you would be comfortable doing, and it's like, have we not met?

33:44.160 --> 33:47.280
This is the greatest day of our life, Teresa.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.520
This is the best thing that's ever happened to us.

33:49.520 --> 33:54.400
I ran through the hallways of work just screaming, you'll never believe, you'll never believe.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.000
So thank you.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.320
Thank you to them and thank you to us.

33:58.320 --> 33:58.640
Thank you.

33:58.640 --> 33:59.440
Thank you, everyone.

34:00.080 --> 34:00.640
You want a yahoo?

34:01.520 --> 34:02.080
No, I do.

34:02.080 --> 34:05.600
Before we continue on, I don't know if you guys know, but there was a tragedy this week.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.800
I'll fucking quit the show.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.760
I know what this is.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.240
The American hero has passed away at the age of 88.

34:10.240 --> 34:16.160
Leonard B. Stern, he was executive producer for Get Smart, he worked on Sergeant Abilco,

34:16.160 --> 34:18.240
and he was also the creator of Mad Libs.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.320
I'm not going to fall into your fucking trap.

34:20.320 --> 34:27.120
And I was asked by many, many of the listeners to give a free eulogy for Mr. Stern, and I

34:27.120 --> 34:28.400
would like to read what I've written now.

34:29.120 --> 34:29.620
Okay.

34:30.720 --> 34:34.800
Today the world has lost a great paladin, and I'm here to tell you a story.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.200
The world has lost a great palindrome.

34:37.200 --> 34:42.880
Leonard Stern, renowned sassafras, frothy poop train, and dwarf paladin died at the

34:42.880 --> 34:43.840
age of swoop.

34:43.840 --> 34:48.560
He was born in a small town of Throbbing, Wisconsin, and attended Yakety Saxe University.

34:48.560 --> 34:52.640
After leaving school, he got his start as an applesauce splurger, but quickly advanced

34:52.640 --> 34:55.040
to pommel horse in a prominent haberdashery.

34:55.040 --> 35:00.160
His co-workers described him as a sketchy and smarmy, and that if you needed a boondoggle,

35:00.160 --> 35:01.360
he was your flubber.

35:01.360 --> 35:05.520
He became a much more caramel gentleman, preferring the company of Kibbe Gibbler.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.760
The funeral service will be held at Bumblebutt Mortuary, and guests are asked to bring a

35:09.760 --> 35:12.320
fart for the moist widow and her three stanky children.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.840
Listen, Mrs. Stern, I'm so sorry.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.920
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.200
I brought you a fart.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.440
Okay, now here's the question.

35:27.440 --> 35:34.240
If you're bringing a widow a fart, do you bring a fart in a jar, or do you wait until

35:34.240 --> 35:39.600
the exact appropriate moment, introduce yourself to the widow, and then fart?

35:39.600 --> 35:42.560
You actually bring it in a casserole dish covered in foil?

35:42.560 --> 35:44.320
I brought you this fart.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.000
Listen, I don't want to be that guy.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.600
Just pop it in the oven for 30 minutes.

35:47.600 --> 35:52.400
I am going to need this back later, so please return to me.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.760
This is my good fart pan.

35:53.760 --> 35:58.240
Once you're done with the fart, please bring the fart pan back.

35:59.040 --> 36:02.960
I'm glad this dude's dead.

36:06.240 --> 36:06.740
Sorry.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.200
Like, sorry.

36:09.200 --> 36:14.320
I know he's a comedy legend probably, but I'm glad he's gone.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.720
If only it could have happened before he invented Mad Libs, you know?

36:18.240 --> 36:19.440
That's messed up.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.400
I'm just saying.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.880
I wouldn't mind loopering him.

36:23.760 --> 36:29.280
He was actually on, uh, he was one of the producers on Supermarket Sweep.

36:29.280 --> 36:29.780
Oh.

36:30.720 --> 36:36.720
I mean that, that, is there a window there where I could, I could looper him, um, between

36:36.720 --> 36:40.160
the invention of Supermarket Sweep and the invention of the Mad Lib?

36:40.880 --> 36:44.000
Because I don't want to, I don't want to sacrifice one for the other, you know what I mean?

36:44.640 --> 36:45.120
You're right.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.160
Yeah, absolutely.

36:46.800 --> 36:47.520
Um, no.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.120
No.

36:49.120 --> 36:49.620
Fuck.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.160
I got a Yahoo for us.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.600
It's, uh, it's by, uh, thank you for sending it in, Colin Dinsmore.

36:55.600 --> 36:59.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jake who asks, does my PE teacher like me?

37:01.440 --> 37:04.480
We were playing a game of rugby and he told me to do a lap of the field.

37:07.280 --> 37:07.780
Yeah.

37:08.320 --> 37:08.880
Okay.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.380
That's it.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.800
That's how bad is this guy at interpreting signals?

37:12.800 --> 37:15.520
That's the given circumstances that we, we have to work with?

37:15.520 --> 37:22.560
That's about it, but I don't, like, that's kind of just like the PE way.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.520
That's like what they do.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.840
It's hard to know if you, listen, some of us have always been curious of whether or not

37:27.840 --> 37:31.760
our PE teacher is like this, and I don't mean in a romantic way.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.040
We all know the answer to that question.

37:35.040 --> 37:38.080
Some of us are just seeking the approval of a PE teach.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.840
I remember when I was watching Mr. Woodcock and thinking, I wonder if my PE teacher-

37:41.840 --> 37:47.680
That fucking movie!

37:47.680 --> 37:51.680
I just laughed at it.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.680
Sean Williams, God.

37:57.840 --> 38:03.840
Are you having a fucking laugh about the existence of Mr. Woodcock as a film?

38:05.120 --> 38:05.840
Oh man.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.440
Is that what tickled you?

38:07.440 --> 38:08.960
Was it a specific-

38:08.960 --> 38:14.480
It was just that it existed and Sean Williams, God, was in it, and you just can't believe

38:14.480 --> 38:15.840
that those two things are true.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.360
Do you guys have any good PE teachers?

38:19.520 --> 38:20.020
Um.

38:20.800 --> 38:24.000
No, we're going to find the humor in this bit if it kills me.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.600
You are apparently already founded.

38:25.600 --> 38:31.680
Apparently it's no, you need to look no further than your DVD rack to see a copy of Mr. Woodcock.

38:31.680 --> 38:35.760
You're three copies, one for every day, one for special occasions, and one for archive.

38:35.760 --> 38:39.600
I couldn't own that fucking movie because every time I saw it, I looked over in the rack.

38:40.320 --> 38:46.160
I can't believe either of you unsportsmanly fucks don't have a single funny gym teacher story.

38:46.160 --> 38:49.920
The only gym teacher story I have is my gym teacher in elementary school telling my parents

38:49.920 --> 38:54.880
that I probably had ADD, and I did in fact, so thanks for that.

38:54.880 --> 38:57.120
It sounds like he saved you a lot of money.

38:57.120 --> 39:01.040
Yeah, thank you for acknowledging my mental deficiencies early on.

39:01.040 --> 39:01.920
I appreciate that.

39:01.920 --> 39:02.420
Um.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.520
I didn't have any funny PE teachers.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.880
I'm probably forgetting one.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.680
There's probably one listed now that says, hey, I was funny.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.280
I worked my ass off.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.400
I worked my ass off for you guys.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.960
Do you remember when we were doing jump rope for heart and I made all those wise

39:16.960 --> 39:18.480
crocs to keep you guys motivated?

39:18.480 --> 39:20.480
Remember I called it jump rope for fart?

39:20.480 --> 39:21.600
Do you remember?

39:21.600 --> 39:22.160
Do you remember?

39:22.880 --> 39:23.680
Can we not?

39:25.440 --> 39:26.560
You guys want a different yahoo?

39:27.440 --> 39:28.000
Yeah.

39:28.000 --> 39:28.880
Okay, this one's-

39:28.880 --> 39:30.000
An additional one, right?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.960
You're not going to edit out where you laughed at Mr. Woodcock for 20 minutes, right?

39:32.960 --> 39:33.600
Oh god.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.600
The name's good too.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.280
Oh, that's what I'm laughing at.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.920
It's got cock in it and also wood.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.760
It's like a double boner joke.

39:43.760 --> 39:48.320
If that movie was about ventriloquists, it would be the best movie ever.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.280
So this one was sent in by Justin Brown.

39:51.280 --> 39:51.920
Thank you, Justin.

39:51.920 --> 40:02.400
It's by yahoo answers user Intelligent John who asks, have you ever tried to punch a bird?

40:02.400 --> 40:03.680
That's all the things that there is.

40:05.120 --> 40:10.480
Like an anchor or like predominance of like a bird you own or bird flying by?

40:10.480 --> 40:12.480
Well, let's run through each of those.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.960
A, I don't think you can hunt a bird with punches.

40:16.560 --> 40:18.000
They're live creatures.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.520
You've got to tap the bird on the shoulder when it turns around and you punch it.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.720
Would a bird stand there and take it?

40:28.720 --> 40:30.480
You couldn't pull that on a cat.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.360
If you try to punch a cat, he's going to go spectral.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.640
He's going to disappear.

40:36.640 --> 40:41.360
If you try to punch a bird, I'm not sure if they have that sort of cat ESP that would

40:41.360 --> 40:42.400
allow them to avoid it.

40:42.400 --> 40:46.000
So you're saying like a cockatiel sitting on its little perch in your room and you just

40:46.000 --> 40:49.120
like walk in, you've had a bad day and you're like, I'm going to fucking punch that bird

40:49.120 --> 40:50.080
and you swing your fist.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.320
The birds all you've thought about all day.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.840
It's the only way you got through me and your little brother trained that bird to say some

40:55.840 --> 40:56.880
really offensive shit.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.400
You got that 3pm feeling.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.520
I can't wait to get fucking home and punch my fucking bird.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.240
Just really let loose and punch the shit out of that bird.

41:06.240 --> 41:10.000
And you're saying that perhaps the bird would just turn and look at you and just take it

41:10.000 --> 41:13.520
full on in the face and maybe do that thing where it dramatically like its head snaps

41:13.520 --> 41:17.120
to the side and then it looks back and like wipes off the blood off its beat.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.160
Oh, I love this.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.560
And then it comes at you just crazy balls.

41:20.560 --> 41:25.200
And all of a sudden it's just a hardcore throw down in your room, that throw down showdown

41:25.200 --> 41:28.720
between you and your cockatiel and the stuff's just getting rowdy.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.760
Can we not say cockatiel?

41:29.760 --> 41:33.600
Well, first of all, we can't say cockatiel because I'm going to start laughing again.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.320
Your wood cockatiel, your Mr. Wood cockatiel.

41:37.040 --> 41:41.520
Also, a cockatiel would just disintegrate if you punch it.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.520
Let's talk about a heartier bird.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.280
OK, so like a blue Amazon parrot?

41:45.840 --> 41:47.280
Maybe you've got an ostrich.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.760
That's a scoring partner right there.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.260
Yeah.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.720
Ostriches are mostly dinosaurs.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.640
You don't start shit with an ostrich.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.040
Can I go to the pet store and say, I want a bird.

41:57.040 --> 41:57.760
Hold up.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.120
I want one that can take a punch.

42:00.080 --> 42:00.800
Not one that will-

42:00.800 --> 42:02.080
I know what you're thinking.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.680
I don't want this bird to buckle over like a little bitch when I punch it.

42:05.680 --> 42:11.360
But how come as many times as I've seen chickens killed on TV,

42:11.920 --> 42:16.400
I've never seen a ostrich decapitated with a machete?

42:16.400 --> 42:18.560
Can you imagine how sweet that would be?

42:18.560 --> 42:20.640
I feel like that's a Mythbusters waiting to happen.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.400
Yeah, here's a myth.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.840
That would be awesome.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.280
Why would that be awesome?

42:25.840 --> 42:27.520
Think about how long its neck is.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.640
There is a lot of neck there.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.200
No, I know.

42:29.840 --> 42:30.640
Where would you cut?

42:30.640 --> 42:32.320
You have so many options.

42:32.320 --> 42:38.080
Like, you could do like a backflip with a sword and chop it anywhere,

42:38.080 --> 42:39.680
and that head's gonna come right off.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.160
You're saying-

42:41.200 --> 42:42.080
It would look awesome.

42:42.080 --> 42:42.480
It's hard to-

42:42.480 --> 42:44.800
As long as we're doing that, then can we do the cartoon thing

42:44.800 --> 42:46.480
where they tie two flamingos together?

42:47.280 --> 42:47.760
I want to try that.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.440
What cartoon thing are you-

42:49.440 --> 42:51.440
They do that with flamingos all the time.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.320
I think it's in Alice in Wonderland.

42:54.320 --> 42:57.760
What avian cartoon snuff films are you watching?

42:57.760 --> 43:03.440
And, by the way, we haven't properly addressed the fact that Justin wants to cut an ostrich's

43:03.440 --> 43:04.960
goddamn head off.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.120
I was trying to steer the conversation away from that.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.440
Away from the fact that our brother's a serial killer.

43:10.560 --> 43:11.440
It would just be fun.

43:12.160 --> 43:13.200
I don't want to do it.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.960
I'm saying I want to see it on YouTube.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.280
They are beautiful regal birds.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.240
They're basically-

43:18.240 --> 43:19.920
They're assholes.

43:19.920 --> 43:21.920
They're super swans is what they are.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.120
They're mega swans.

43:23.120 --> 43:32.400
I think if you have something with that long of a neck, it is just begging to be decapitated.

43:32.400 --> 43:36.080
Do you think that somewhere like God or the creator of whatever is sitting around going,

43:36.080 --> 43:38.800
like, I can't believe nobody's decapitated those birds yet.

43:38.800 --> 43:39.760
I gave it to them.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.400
That was a gimmick.

43:40.400 --> 43:44.000
Did you just get theological on us?

43:44.000 --> 43:49.200
Whatever Supreme Being created ostriches, obviously made them for-

43:49.200 --> 43:53.520
I didn't want to alienate the Venn diagram of people that both don't believe in God,

43:53.520 --> 43:55.360
but also want to see ostriches killed.

43:55.360 --> 43:55.760
Yeah, sure, sure.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.280
I didn't want to alienate them.

43:58.400 --> 44:02.160
You know that flamingos are not always pink.

44:02.800 --> 44:07.360
They're pink because their color is determined by their diet.

44:07.360 --> 44:08.800
So you think it's a lifestyle choice?

44:09.360 --> 44:10.320
Yeah, because they-

44:10.320 --> 44:11.280
Do you guys know about that?

44:11.280 --> 44:13.840
They aided the shrimp and they turned it pink.

44:14.400 --> 44:14.800
I don't-

44:14.800 --> 44:19.120
Shrimp and pussy.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.240
Man, did you guys know that about flamingos?

44:24.240 --> 44:25.120
They're freaks.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.000
Oh, man.

44:26.000 --> 44:26.480
They will just-

44:26.480 --> 44:27.600
Flamingos will-

44:27.600 --> 44:30.000
I want to see a flamingo and an ostrich make love.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.160
I know that's coming out of left field, you guys, but God, it would be beautiful.

44:34.160 --> 44:34.960
The joke's on you.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.240
Birds can't love.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.440
They're not capable of it.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.400
I'd like to just see them sex each other.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.600
What is with people who have birds as pets?

44:43.600 --> 44:44.160
Seriously.

44:44.160 --> 44:45.280
Doesn't make sense.

44:45.280 --> 44:52.640
I want a pet that I can't touch and is also as loud as and as constant as a fire alarm.

44:52.640 --> 44:56.480
And at any given moment might just flip out and try to pet my face.

44:56.480 --> 45:01.760
I want something in my house that I can't interact with that will just periodically shit everywhere.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.960
Yeah, and make a terrible noise and I hate it.

45:04.960 --> 45:06.320
I hate this thing.

45:06.320 --> 45:10.080
And that literally, if someone leaves the window open, it's gone forever.

45:10.080 --> 45:10.480
Yeah.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.680
Yeah, and it'll never come back.

45:11.680 --> 45:19.120
Yeah, a bird is never going to look at you with anything more than those sad, soulless,

45:19.120 --> 45:20.240
dead eyes that-

45:21.280 --> 45:25.360
Well, what passes for eyes, they're a little more than polished opals.

45:25.360 --> 45:29.680
They just stare right through you and they're never going to love you.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.920
They're just birds with no capability.

45:31.920 --> 45:35.840
I have to point out, unlike cats and dogs, they actually have a natural habitat that

45:35.840 --> 45:38.320
they belong in and it's not your bedroom.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.840
It's not like you can return, like, your beagle to the wild.

45:41.840 --> 45:42.320
If I left my cat-

45:42.320 --> 45:44.640
For like fucking birds mowing in the Amazon, you jerk.

45:44.640 --> 45:50.560
If I took my cat and dropped it outside, it would be like, oh, well, okay, what now?

45:50.560 --> 45:51.600
Where's the litter in this place?

45:51.600 --> 45:56.720
But if I had a parakeet and I took it outside, it'd be like, bye, fucker.

45:57.360 --> 45:57.760
Got it.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.040
Oh, thank God.

45:59.040 --> 45:59.840
Oh, thank God.

45:59.840 --> 46:04.560
I'm going to go find a tree because that's kind of my jam, is a tree.

46:04.560 --> 46:09.520
You can take your parrot into public provided you clip its wings so that it doesn't fly.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.040
Because you're a real asshole.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.800
That's a good basis for a relationship.

46:12.800 --> 46:15.920
Yeah, I'm afraid of my dog running away, so I chopped off one of his feet.

46:15.920 --> 46:19.280
Yeah, my daughter tried to go to college, so I cut her legs off.

46:20.320 --> 46:20.720
Yeah.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.720
I misread her really hard.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.600
I misread my daughter because I didn't want her to leave.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.520
Now her and my bird just cry all the time.

46:27.520 --> 46:28.400
I love you, Becky.

46:28.400 --> 46:29.280
I love you, Becky.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.800
Sorry about your shin bones.

46:30.800 --> 46:31.840
Let's talk about falcons.

46:31.840 --> 46:32.720
That'd be cool though.

46:33.440 --> 46:33.920
Okay.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.600
Now I have always wanted to do that.

46:35.600 --> 46:35.840
Sure.

46:36.400 --> 46:40.720
If you trained a falcon, but even then it's like weaponized.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.520
It's not a pet.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.400
I do love the idea of just a living weapon.

46:45.120 --> 46:45.360
Yeah.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.120
Because that's also what I consider myself.

46:47.120 --> 46:47.600
Yeah, yeah.

46:48.320 --> 46:53.360
I mean, on the plus side, you're going to be able to become a gunslinger at an

46:53.360 --> 46:54.880
unprecedentedly young age.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.200
That's good.

46:57.200 --> 47:04.800
The bad side is that somewhere there is a flying knife that you have trained that

47:04.800 --> 47:06.160
would love nothing more.

47:06.160 --> 47:09.200
And at your death, we'll just go on a killing spree.

47:09.200 --> 47:12.320
Just that you're the only thing keeping that flying knife in check.

47:12.880 --> 47:15.440
God, that would be a good name for a falcon though if I had it.

47:15.440 --> 47:16.400
Come flying knife.

47:17.440 --> 47:18.960
Guessing it's my side.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.560
Not too fast though, please.

47:20.560 --> 47:24.240
What would you call a falcon if you?

47:24.240 --> 47:25.360
Condor man.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.240
Condor man.

47:26.240 --> 47:26.560
Okay.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.560
That's good because he's neither condor nor man.

47:28.560 --> 47:28.960
Exactly.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.320
It's really going to fuck with his enemies.

47:31.280 --> 47:35.920
I would name it Gongham style because I think people would, it would be like carbon dating

47:35.920 --> 47:38.000
it because people would know it too.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.920
Like within a day when I bought this bird.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.520
This is my falcon pogs.

47:44.080 --> 47:44.400
Yeah.

47:47.200 --> 47:49.280
This is my falcon Judge Lance Edo.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.480
Can I call my falcon Billy Ocean?

47:54.480 --> 47:56.320
Of course you can.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.120
Get out of my dreams and get out of my hair.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.240
You're killing me.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.160
Please stop watching me while I sleep.

48:02.160 --> 48:06.320
I just decided that if I saw somebody on the streets of Austin with a bird on their hand,

48:06.320 --> 48:09.280
I would just think they were a hipster probably.

48:10.880 --> 48:13.040
That is, that is not a joke.

48:13.040 --> 48:16.160
It is not outside the realm of, of possibility.

48:16.160 --> 48:19.920
There's a guy who walks around Huntington with a parrot on his shoulder.

48:19.920 --> 48:20.160
Yeah.

48:20.160 --> 48:23.920
I also want to point out when it comes to falcons, you literally have to like blindfold

48:23.920 --> 48:26.240
them to keep them from killing people.

48:26.240 --> 48:26.800
Yeah.

48:26.800 --> 48:31.760
Like they have specially designed hat and blinders so that the birds do not just freak

48:31.760 --> 48:34.000
out and murder everything they see.

48:34.560 --> 48:41.280
I, I, there's this guy who used to always hang out at a restaurant that used to be in

48:41.280 --> 48:46.800
town called Chili Willy's that had a parrot and he would bring his parrot into the restaurant,

48:46.800 --> 48:48.880
which I think is foul by the way.

48:48.880 --> 48:49.840
That's a bird.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.280
You don't know what it does.

48:51.280 --> 48:54.320
He would bring his bird in the restaurant and then, and I would see him there all the

48:54.320 --> 48:54.560
time.

48:54.560 --> 48:58.160
I would think, huh, I guess Chili Willy, you know, I guess he must be friends with the

48:58.160 --> 48:58.880
owner or whatever.

48:59.600 --> 49:04.880
And now a new restaurant has opened up in that same locale called Backyard Pizza.

49:04.880 --> 49:07.280
And I've seen that motherfucker with his parrot again.

49:07.280 --> 49:11.440
I don't know if he's a feature of the building or if I think the one place he could take

49:11.440 --> 49:13.680
his parrot with his parrot won't lose his goddamn mind.

49:13.680 --> 49:16.000
Do you think he's providing a service?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.320
He's providing a service to Huntington restaurants.

49:18.320 --> 49:22.400
Like I will make your shit look more interesting by standing in front of it.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.920
People want to know my story.

49:23.920 --> 49:28.240
They'll get hungry cause I'll talk to them for two hours about my fucking parrot.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.480
And then I'll let the parrot do a little bit of the talking.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.200
And don't even worry about spiders anymore.

49:33.200 --> 49:35.760
He'll take care of all the colorful beetles.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.280
You can't pay me in pizza.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.720
Hey, do parrots eat pizza?

49:38.720 --> 49:39.360
Ah, fuck it.

49:40.960 --> 49:41.840
I'll eat his.

49:41.840 --> 49:43.120
I'll eat his pizza.

49:43.120 --> 49:45.200
What's, what's that flying knife?

49:45.200 --> 49:46.480
You want to eat some food?

49:46.480 --> 49:47.840
Well, you have pizza.

49:47.840 --> 49:50.160
You should have eaten your pizza there that I had to eat for you.

49:50.160 --> 49:50.640
Oh, what's that?

49:50.640 --> 49:54.960
You need me to launch the pizza upwards into the sky at a hundred miles an hour before

49:54.960 --> 49:56.560
you'll be interested in it at all.

49:56.560 --> 49:56.880
Okay.

49:57.520 --> 50:00.240
Fuck the fucking next stop flash forward.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.760
America's got talent.

50:01.760 --> 50:03.920
You got a million dollar check.

50:03.920 --> 50:05.600
Your show's opening in Vegas.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.440
This is my pet flying knife.

50:07.440 --> 50:09.600
The amazing pizza catching parrot.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.840
I love dead mouse pizza please.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.280
He died after three weeks.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.560
I had to train a new one.

50:16.560 --> 50:17.600
I hate this job.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.440
The world's fattest falcon.

50:19.440 --> 50:23.760
I hate this job almost as much as birds apparently hate pizza.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.520
This bird has acne.

50:25.520 --> 50:26.720
Get up there, flying knife.

50:26.720 --> 50:30.640
My flying knife, you have acne and your breath smells like garlic.

50:30.640 --> 50:31.520
I hate you now.

50:32.080 --> 50:33.040
I always hated you.

50:33.040 --> 50:34.560
Why can't you look at me with love?

50:34.560 --> 50:35.520
Put your hat back on.

50:35.520 --> 50:36.720
You're creeping me out.

50:36.720 --> 50:40.640
How come you never bring me a Bud Light like the cool birds in the commercials do?

50:40.640 --> 50:47.120
This is my parrot and this is our Las Vegas style show.

50:47.920 --> 50:52.240
It's now been moved to the Catskills and I trained my parrot to get me a beer.

50:52.880 --> 50:54.320
Does anybody else want a beer?

50:54.320 --> 50:55.440
Hold on a second.

50:55.440 --> 50:58.960
Wear this gauntlet because he will attack.

50:59.520 --> 51:03.280
Can you imagine if you owned a parrot and then like you brought home a falcon?

51:03.280 --> 51:05.040
What the parrot must think in that moment?

51:07.680 --> 51:09.440
What would a parrot think?

51:09.440 --> 51:10.960
Not that birds could think.

51:10.960 --> 51:11.600
Oh fuck.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.280
What's he calling it?

51:13.280 --> 51:14.240
Flying knife?

51:14.240 --> 51:15.280
That's such a cool name.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.240
He called me Steve.

51:16.240 --> 51:16.960
What the fuck?

51:16.960 --> 51:18.160
Why did he name me Steve?

51:18.720 --> 51:20.160
Name your parrot Raven.

51:21.600 --> 51:22.720
He won't see that coming.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.720
Hey, my friend and I saw a movie on the last day I was playing.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.880
As it turned out, we were the only two there.

51:29.680 --> 51:32.160
We usually like to stick around through the credits.

51:32.160 --> 51:35.520
On the off chance there's a bonus scene at the end, but halfway through the credits,

51:35.520 --> 51:38.800
I saw an usher glaring at us impatiently from the doorway,

51:38.800 --> 51:40.320
waiting for us to leave.

51:40.320 --> 51:44.320
I feel as paying moviegoers, we have the right to stick around until the lights come up,

51:44.320 --> 51:45.840
even if we're the only ones there.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.360
Am I in the wrong on this?

51:47.360 --> 51:49.520
And that's from ushered out in Utah.

51:49.520 --> 51:52.480
Well, I have great news for you ushered out in Utah.

51:53.520 --> 51:58.240
And this still is not a paid endorsement, but if you get the iPhone app Run P,

51:58.800 --> 52:01.200
it will not only tell you the best time to take a bathroom break,

52:01.200 --> 52:03.440
it will tell you if there is something after the credits,

52:04.000 --> 52:04.880
whether or not you need to stay.

52:04.880 --> 52:10.080
But do you think that's going to stave off the condescending stare of the movie theater usher?

52:11.520 --> 52:14.240
Who cares about that guy?

52:14.240 --> 52:16.320
I was that dude.

52:16.320 --> 52:16.640
Yeah.

52:17.280 --> 52:22.080
Yeah, but people should be able to sit there and enjoy their film without you rushing them out.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.600
I'm saying he's being a jerk.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.760
Well, I think the trait, here's the thing.

52:25.760 --> 52:28.640
The fact of the matter is, if you're the only two people in the theater,

52:28.640 --> 52:30.640
it's not like brothers got a lot of cleaning to do.

52:31.920 --> 52:33.680
Wow, that's a good point, Travis.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.160
How long is it going to take them to clean up after two people?

52:36.160 --> 52:36.640
Right?

52:36.640 --> 52:40.160
So unless you were just like changing seats every five minutes

52:40.160 --> 52:42.640
and then dumping your junior mints on the ground.

52:42.640 --> 52:43.680
I spilled them again.

52:44.400 --> 52:45.520
Hey, usher.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.160
Mom.

52:46.160 --> 52:46.880
Hey, usher.

52:47.680 --> 52:51.520
Usher or mom or usher Raymond.

52:51.520 --> 52:52.080
Anybody.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.280
I spilled them again.

52:54.000 --> 52:54.880
Spilled them.

52:54.880 --> 52:55.840
Hey, Will Ferrell.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.200
Hey, Will Ferrell in the movie.

52:57.200 --> 52:58.240
I spilled them.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.360
Please come out of the movie.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.800
I want Goobers this time.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.920
Turn my mints into Goobers.

53:05.040 --> 53:07.680
I want to return exchange these mints for Goobers.

53:08.720 --> 53:09.840
I only ate five.

53:09.840 --> 53:10.560
It's not fair.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.960
It turns out Rosebud is his sled, everybody.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.960
By the way, this happened in 1940.

53:18.960 --> 53:19.200
Wow.

53:19.840 --> 53:20.480
This is fun.

53:20.480 --> 53:22.880
Did you know that was a time travel scene?

53:25.120 --> 53:25.440
What?

53:26.560 --> 53:29.360
You are not doing this guy any disservice because when you're an usher,

53:29.360 --> 53:32.480
here's the life of an usher.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.080
Here's how a shift breaks down.

53:34.080 --> 53:36.320
You get to stand around and watch the end of a movie

53:36.320 --> 53:37.680
and wait for the theater to clear out.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.040
That's one of the things you do.

53:39.040 --> 53:42.320
Sometimes you go and you have to fill up a bucket with mop water.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.280
That's cool.

53:43.280 --> 53:47.920
Sometimes you have to clean up puke and jizz and skull leavings.

53:48.880 --> 53:51.600
And be careful not to stab yourself on your syringes.

53:51.600 --> 53:54.320
That's the worst part of the job.

53:54.320 --> 53:56.000
And as long as they're not doing that,

53:56.000 --> 53:59.920
then they are probably just happy to be standing still.

54:00.880 --> 54:02.080
I used to work at a theater.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.880
You know what they used to do for your lunch and dinner break?

54:05.520 --> 54:07.280
They used to say on our lunch and dinner breaks,

54:07.280 --> 54:12.160
they would say you can go and chill out for, you know,

54:12.160 --> 54:14.800
30 minutes or however long in one of the theaters.

54:16.080 --> 54:20.240
And so you would just go watch fucking 30 minutes of a movie

54:20.240 --> 54:22.560
and it was absolute torture.

54:22.560 --> 54:27.040
It's so sad. What was that Ryan Reynolds haunted house one?

54:27.040 --> 54:28.400
The remake? Amityville Horror.

54:28.400 --> 54:29.520
Spooky Mansion.

54:29.520 --> 54:33.280
I watched 30 minutes of Spooky Mansion, like the same 30 minutes.

54:33.280 --> 54:33.760
Oh yeah.

54:33.760 --> 54:34.560
For like a week.

54:35.840 --> 54:36.400
I saw-

54:36.400 --> 54:39.200
And as far as I know, I think they all died.

54:39.200 --> 54:43.840
I saw the end of The Grudge 2 probably 22 different times.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.200
Like the last four minutes.

54:45.840 --> 54:50.320
And it was some woman just getting wrecked by a Japanese ghost.

54:50.320 --> 54:54.160
I saw that shit so, so many times because I had to.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.680
You know what? I take it back.

54:55.680 --> 54:57.840
Do whatever this usher wants you to.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.360
Their life is nothing but fucking pain.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.240
Because here's the thing.

55:00.240 --> 55:01.680
Here's the thing that's just occurred to me.

55:01.680 --> 55:04.320
The real horseshit is not you staying after the movie.

55:04.320 --> 55:06.960
The real horseshit is this is the last day this movie's in there.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.440
Probably no one's coming to see this movie in two weeks.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.840
And dude was thinking like, cool, movie starts.

55:11.840 --> 55:12.560
I don't have to worry about it.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.160
We probably wouldn't even run the whole thing.

55:14.160 --> 55:17.600
And then you and your friends show up to watch it on the last day

55:17.600 --> 55:22.720
at like an 11 a.m. showing and just ruin this dude's hour and a half break.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.320
Now here's a suggestion.

55:24.320 --> 55:25.200
What about this?

55:25.200 --> 55:28.000
Why don't we engage him as a person and say,

55:28.000 --> 55:31.360
hey, do you know if there's anything after the credits?

55:31.360 --> 55:32.160
Because they will know.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.080
They've cleaned up after this.

55:34.080 --> 55:38.080
Just be like, I felt that the ending left me hollow and I don't know how to feel.

55:39.680 --> 55:40.720
Let me go devil's advocate.

55:40.720 --> 55:42.080
And by devil, I mean the usher.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.160
Let me be usher's advocate.

55:44.160 --> 55:45.760
Let me be usher's advocate here.

55:45.760 --> 55:50.960
He doesn't want to hang out with two weirdos who just saw a movie by themselves

55:51.600 --> 55:54.400
because let me tell you, I'm putting myself in his shoes.

55:54.400 --> 55:58.000
You guys were probably talking in his mind's eye.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.200
That's what was going on.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.360
You were tugging into his mind's eye.

56:01.360 --> 56:04.960
If he gets if he looks like full grump,

56:04.960 --> 56:08.720
it's probably because he thinks there's going to be tug leavings in his future.

56:10.640 --> 56:12.240
I think they're just called tugging.

56:12.240 --> 56:16.080
If he's got tuggies, he's got tuggies waiting for him.

56:16.080 --> 56:20.880
And do you think he wants to see the last eight minutes of Expendables 2

56:20.880 --> 56:22.080
and then clean up tuggies?

56:22.080 --> 56:22.960
Of course not.

56:23.680 --> 56:24.400
Of course not.

56:25.760 --> 56:31.040
He's going to need all this mental energy to keep a gum barrel out of his mouth tonight.

56:31.040 --> 56:34.160
You really think he wants to chat with you about whether or not

56:34.160 --> 56:36.880
Ryan Reynolds should have ended up with Sandra Bullock at the end?

56:36.880 --> 56:37.520
Probably not.

56:37.520 --> 56:38.880
He's sad about your tuggies.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.480
Leave the movie 10 minutes early.

56:40.480 --> 56:47.920
If you feel like the movie is coming to a close, you should stay on opposite sides of the theater

56:47.920 --> 56:50.160
so that when he comes in, he knows that there was no thank you.

56:50.160 --> 56:54.640
Or just as soon as he walks in, just say, no tuggies, bro.

56:54.640 --> 56:55.360
Don't worry.

56:55.360 --> 56:57.680
Just keep your hands in the air like you're at a middle school dance.

57:01.120 --> 57:05.840
It's as clean as when the theater rolled off the factory floor.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.760
In fact, we found some tuggies in the back row.

57:07.760 --> 57:08.960
We cleaned them up for you.

57:08.960 --> 57:09.360
Yeah.

57:09.360 --> 57:13.680
Or maybe when he comes in, you hide so he doesn't know you're there.

57:13.680 --> 57:17.200
When he comes in, you're sweeping popcorn into a little like, you're like, I got it.

57:17.200 --> 57:20.480
You jump up into the rafters like a howler monkey.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.680
He'll never know you're there.

57:21.680 --> 57:24.320
And you can just finish watching it as he cleans beneath you.

57:24.320 --> 57:26.400
Why don't you come in dressed as an usher?

57:27.600 --> 57:29.920
Why don't you come in dressed as usher?

57:29.920 --> 57:30.800
Dressed as usher.

57:31.840 --> 57:34.880
Hi, you wouldn't make usher leave the theater early, would you?

57:34.880 --> 57:38.800
Sir, you are 300 pounds and white as the fallen snow.

57:38.800 --> 57:40.480
Please, please leave the theater.

57:41.040 --> 57:44.480
You look like that really fat comedian.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.080
Ah, that would have been funnier if I could remember his name.

57:48.080 --> 57:49.280
What's that fool's name?

57:49.280 --> 57:51.360
You would literally, there's like five choices here.

57:51.360 --> 57:52.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.320
The one who won last Comic Standing.

57:54.320 --> 57:55.440
Oh, Renee Fatslin.

57:56.400 --> 57:56.800
What?

57:56.800 --> 57:56.960
No.

57:56.960 --> 57:58.080
Renee Fatslin?

57:58.080 --> 57:58.320
No.

57:59.040 --> 57:59.840
Louie Anderson.

58:00.880 --> 58:01.200
GERP.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.280
No.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.320
GERP.

58:04.320 --> 58:04.880
It's his name.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.000
Ralph E. Mays.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.080
Ralph E. Mays, that's it.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.440
Okay, I'm going to try that again.

58:09.440 --> 58:12.960
And, take two.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.480
You look like Ralph E. Mays.

58:16.480 --> 58:16.960
Nailed it.

58:17.680 --> 58:18.480
Nailed it.

58:19.040 --> 58:20.960
Old two-take Justin, they call him.

58:22.560 --> 58:23.920
Nailed it in two.

58:25.520 --> 58:26.000
Cut.

58:26.000 --> 58:26.480
Prank.

58:28.000 --> 58:28.960
Sir, rough.

58:28.960 --> 58:30.640
Can we just edit this?

58:30.640 --> 58:31.600
Just cut it.

58:31.600 --> 58:32.160
Cut it.

58:32.160 --> 58:32.720
Cut it.

58:32.720 --> 58:33.280
Cut it.

58:33.280 --> 58:33.780
Cut it.

58:33.780 --> 58:34.280
Cut it.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.680
Just get it there.

58:35.680 --> 58:36.720
Just cut that in.

58:38.160 --> 58:40.320
Take out the part where we did the other Tuesday.

58:40.320 --> 58:40.960
It'll be like.

58:43.200 --> 58:44.800
He's going to cut and paste.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.960
He looks like, and then Microsoft Sam.

58:47.680 --> 58:48.560
Ralph E. Mays.

58:50.560 --> 58:52.960
Can you do that and then just cut out everything from when we

58:52.960 --> 58:55.520
talked about BE teachers, except for when I said Mr.

58:55.520 --> 58:57.040
Wolfhawk and you lost it.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.680
Just like have a parenthetical statement within the show.

58:59.680 --> 59:03.120
I want this episode to be 45 seconds long.

59:03.120 --> 59:06.400
I want it to be you, you laughing about Mr.

59:06.400 --> 59:08.160
Woodcock and me saying.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.280
Hey, do you guys remember Mr.

59:09.280 --> 59:09.760
Woodcock?

59:10.560 --> 59:11.360
Ralph E. Mays.

59:11.360 --> 59:13.040
L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O.

59:14.000 --> 59:14.960
L-O, L-O.

59:14.960 --> 59:16.240
Keep your heart, three sacks.

59:16.240 --> 59:17.520
Keep your heart, three sacks.

59:17.520 --> 59:18.020
The end.

59:18.960 --> 59:20.800
We got to throw extreme restraints in there too.

59:21.520 --> 59:24.960
That podcast you told me to listen to, you were 100% right.

59:24.960 --> 59:27.840
It was 45 seconds long, but there was an uninterrupted bit

59:27.840 --> 59:34.000
about fuck toys for money.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.280
If this show were just a elaborate construct for which

59:39.280 --> 59:43.760
to deliver bits about sex toys, which I guess it is.

59:44.320 --> 59:47.200
They laughed at poor Sean William Scott and then talked

59:47.200 --> 59:49.680
about snakes coming out of a dick for like an hour and a half.

59:49.680 --> 59:52.720
They laughed at the existence of Sean William Scott,

59:52.720 --> 59:55.600
like just as a whole, his whole scenario.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.880
I was thinking about his funny bits from the movie.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.400
Yeah, like, yeah.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.080
Yeah, for sure.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.040
Thank you for listening to our comedy podcast,

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.240
my brother, my brother and me.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.960
It's been just another great time.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.720
A lot of laughs.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.320
Thanks for people sending things to us in the mail.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:23.040
Again, our address is PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.360
And you can just send that attention, me.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.160
No bombs.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:29.840
No bombs.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.200
You should write on it, no bombs.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.600
No Tuggies, no bombs.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.880
In fact, especially the first thing.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.880
No Tuggies.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.880
I know it seems like a good idea now.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:49.120
Thanks to people tweeting about the show,

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.440
Thomas Rice, Double Wizard, The Incredible K, Opposable Plums,

And if you're not already following MBMBAM Wisdom, you should.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.200
It's a funny Twitter account that you can enjoy.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.040
Thank you to Joe fucking Robinson for sending me a Pepsi

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:19.920
Man action figure.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.880
Holy shit.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.760
Are you kidding?

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.720
No, I'm serious.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.220
Goals.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.240
I know.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.200
It's going to be the best.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.120
Did we get any more extremely rare and valuable Pokemon cards?

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.920
No, no more extremely.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.440
I did throw those others away, though.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:38.080
Ah, ah, ah, no.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.960
I also want to say, if you have someone that you love with a birthday coming up,

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.560
or an anniversary, or a big occasion, and you want to shout out on the show for them,

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:52.080
just go to Maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron and all the information is there.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.640
We'd love to wish them a happy birthday or tell them that you love them or if you got

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.840
a business back or something.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.680
And if you have a business and you'd like a little commercial message on there,

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.120
just go to the same link.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.080
Maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.040
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.760
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.320
Maybe we should switch in like other tracks from that album

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:16.820
in there.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.020
You think?

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.520
There are a lot.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.400
There's a lot of good tracks and they're all pretty high energy.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.400
I bet they would get things going with a bang.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.600
Anyway, that probably won't happen.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.480
Yeah, probably.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.280
And remember, if you have any ghost-related questions,

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.400
send them in so we can do a-

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.840
Next week, all ghosts.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.600
Nothing fucking stupid, though.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.240
Like, we all- ghosts don't exist and like, that's cool.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.320
Make them- just make them good.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.520
Stop sending in shitty ghost questions, everyone.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.400
Yeah, just send your best ones.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.160
All ghosts next week.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.320
And thank you for listening to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.600
this podcast here that we're on doing right now.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.400
We have got to stop drinking before doing the show.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.160
Yeah, good luck.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.800
Griffin, I believe you said you had one more question.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.080
Yeah, I have one to grow on.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.240
It's by- it was sent in by Nicole Thompson.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:08.880
Thank you, Nicole.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.280

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.920
Where are Bird's ears at?

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.120

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:17.920
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:18.960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.880
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.520
Kiss your dads.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:42.480
Go around the lips.
