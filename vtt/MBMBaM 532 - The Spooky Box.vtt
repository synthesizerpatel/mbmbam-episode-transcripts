WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.120
Okay, this is the introduction to the program. We've been doing our introduction,

00:49.920 --> 00:56.800
the set, like the very beginning, the same way for 500 and however fucking many episodes.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.160
Wait, are we in it now?

00:58.160 --> 00:58.960
Yeah, this is the show.

00:58.960 --> 00:59.520
Oh, okay.

00:59.520 --> 01:04.160
I want to start, we're going to start the show, but we're going to do it different,

01:04.160 --> 01:06.400
and we have to organically find that.

01:06.400 --> 01:06.880
All right.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.200
It can't be a bit, it can't be a bit.

01:09.200 --> 01:15.280
It's got to be like practiced, sounding good, but it's just got to organically happen

01:15.280 --> 01:19.520
without me sort of taking control and steering as I have as the Capitan.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.400
Can I try something? Can I just pitch something right off the bat?

01:23.200 --> 01:27.680
If you're going to make a strategy or a plan for how to cope with this, you can't.

01:27.680 --> 01:36.320
It's just got to be like, we talk in our book, everybody has a podcast except you in theaters,

01:36.320 --> 01:37.920
January 2021.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.800
If you sneak it into the theater, technically it's-

01:42.800 --> 01:44.160
You got to have a plan.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.880
It's the only book that also works as a mask, so you can just wear it when you go to the theater.

01:48.880 --> 01:55.680
People think it sounds organic when you start doing a show, it sounds natural and organic,

01:55.680 --> 02:00.240
and I just want to see what organically happens without a strategy for how to begin the program.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.280
Well, who's that talking?

02:01.280 --> 02:03.200
That's my older brother, Justin McElroy.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.000
Hey, Trav, thanks for, see, I-

02:08.000 --> 02:08.960
No, you fucked it up.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.240
I fucked it up.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.080
Justin, it's time for the weekly joke.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.840
It's time for Justin's joke of the week.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.040
Now we would definitely introduce ourselves in this new introduction.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.440
Well, this is before Travis and I introduce ourselves.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.400
I historically have done Justin's, it used to be called Justin's naughty joke of the week,

02:26.400 --> 02:29.680
and it was actually a joke of the natural nature.

02:29.680 --> 02:30.720
It was ribald.

02:30.720 --> 02:35.760
It was like a sexual joke, like dirty as fuck, like some real dock worker shit.

02:35.760 --> 02:43.920
There's no reality in which this podcast, this new podcast intro that we're forging

02:44.560 --> 02:49.040
would start with before our names, a naughty joke of the week.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.600
Well, not anymore, now it's just a regular joke.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.760
Me and, I swear to Christ, Justin, me and Travis are going to say our names,

02:55.760 --> 03:01.120
but first we do like, hey, oh, and this is our oldest brother, Justin,

03:01.120 --> 03:03.360
and Justin, you swing in there and you're like, ha ha.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.000
Here's a joke, here's one I heard, have you heard this?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.040
Here's one I heard this week.

03:07.040 --> 03:07.360
Dirty, dirtier.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.240
This isn't a joke.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.200
Dirtier.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.120
No, no, it's not Justin's dirty joke.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.960
It's not that anymore, just regular joke.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.720
Hey, this isn't a joke.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.960
Sorry, Justin, clarify, it could still be dirty.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.800
It just doesn't have to be dirty, Justin.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.160
I want to give you room to work.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.480
I just wanted to start with a fun fact.

03:22.480 --> 03:26.400
Did you hear about that, the sarcophagus over in Egypt that they found

03:26.400 --> 03:29.120
that had been open for 2,000 years, did you hear about this?

03:29.120 --> 03:29.360
No.

03:30.480 --> 03:37.040
Yeah, there's this sarcophagus that they opened and had been closed for 2,500 years,

03:37.040 --> 03:38.320
and here's the wild part.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.840
The body inside was covered in chocolate and nuts.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.480
They think it might've been Ferrero Rocher.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.160
Huh.

03:46.160 --> 03:50.880
Huh, so that's, I did like them better when you were like, what's the difference between them?

03:50.880 --> 03:54.720
Could you say like, and he had a boner, sorry, because he mentioned nuts and that was really

03:54.720 --> 03:58.000
close, but if he said he was covered in chocolate and nuts and he had like a boner.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.480
Sorry, let me set you up for that juice and we'll cut all the stuff between this out.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.840
Did you say nuts?

04:07.440 --> 04:08.320
There it is.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.760
What, and what was that sound, Justin?

04:10.560 --> 04:11.680
Was it the mummy's boner?

04:11.680 --> 04:13.520
Was it the mummy's boner?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.240
Was it your boner?

04:14.240 --> 04:15.040
What was that?

04:15.040 --> 04:16.560
Oh, oh, okay, wait, hold on.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.000
Let's do it again.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.160
Let's do the, let's just keep it smooth.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.520
Did you just say nuts?

04:25.200 --> 04:28.240
Why was the teenage mummy so nervous in class?

04:29.440 --> 04:31.280
He couldn't keep his boner under wraps.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.040
Okay.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.800
All right, so you're kind of, stop, stop.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.720
That can't be your thing too, Travis.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.680
I know, but-

04:41.680 --> 04:45.040
Your thing can't also be dirty mummy jokes.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.800
But it's all I know, Justin, or Griffin, maybe you're Justin now.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.360
This nobody knows because we haven't introduced ourselves.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.880
Well, you've introduced, we know one thing.

04:52.880 --> 04:53.840
I'm not Justin.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.800
I don't, they don't know who the fuck I am, but they know I'm not Justin because I haven't

04:56.800 --> 04:58.000
been telling dirty mummy jokes.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.040
Are you the teenage mummy?

04:59.040 --> 05:03.120
Why didn't you guys decide putting me on blast would be the bit for the introduction?

05:03.120 --> 05:07.840
My introduction that I wanted to do was coming up with a new introduction for the show.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.680
Justin, you put yourself on blast.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.000
I teed you up, I said, this is my older brother, Justin.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.600
And then you choked.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.040
And as punishment, we tried to make you shine.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.240
Okay, I've paid my penance.

05:18.880 --> 05:19.680
Starting fresh.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.160
Okay.

05:20.160 --> 05:25.200
The person has just pressed play on their podcatcher and action.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.360
Why was the teenage mummy nervous in class?

05:27.360 --> 05:28.160
Now, wait a minute.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.640
Why the fuck would it pulled open?

05:30.640 --> 05:32.960
Are you poaching the mummy boner sort of?

05:32.960 --> 05:37.040
Well, if we're restarting now, we've edited it out when Justin was like the dirty mummy.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.320
We've edited out all of it.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.720
This is just the introduction for the podcast.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.200
Justin isn't the dirty mummy boy anymore.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.520
So I saw an opportunity to take it now that things-

05:45.520 --> 05:47.680
But you haven't said your name.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.800
It was cold open.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.160
It's a cold open.

05:50.160 --> 05:50.800
They don't open.

05:50.800 --> 05:55.120
Justin, they don't fucking open up starting it live like, hey, everybody, it's me,

05:55.120 --> 06:01.040
Skellen Jokesman, and today I'm going to be doing Reince Priebus.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.720
Reince Priebus back in the news.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.400
You hear about this?

06:06.400 --> 06:10.720
You hear about this?

06:10.720 --> 06:12.560
That's gonna- I call dibs on that.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.040
My thing is talking about what Reince is up to.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.240
Yeah.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.480
I hear he drives a Prius.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.200
Okay, let's cut all this.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.000
Let's cut all this.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.800
This obviously isn't it.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.720
Just press play and action.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.280
Why was the teenage Reince Priebus nervous in class?

06:27.280 --> 06:27.840
Okay, stop.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.120
You can't-

06:29.120 --> 06:30.880
He couldn't get his boner under wraps.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.720
Okay, okay.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.200
You know what?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.160
I'm going to grant you that.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.680
Oh, Reince Priebus was a mummy too.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.920
Okay, Trav, do your joke again.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.120
I'm going to lean into it a little bit better, and I'm sorry for shutting you down.

06:43.120 --> 06:47.360
The person presses play on their podcatcher, and this is what they hear.

06:47.360 --> 06:51.520
Why was the teenage Reince Priebus, who was also a mummy, nervous in class?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.520
Because he couldn't keep his boner under wraps?

06:53.520 --> 06:54.020
Fuck!

06:54.020 --> 07:01.220
Welcome, everybody, to my brother, my brother, and me.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.100
Wait, okay, you're right.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.420
Okay, Trav, that didn't work.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.420
Griffin, I'd love for you to try one.

07:09.140 --> 07:09.620
Yeah, sure.

07:10.820 --> 07:13.700
And the person presses play and action.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.060
Did you guys hear about Reince Priebus?

07:19.060 --> 07:19.860
No, I didn't.

07:19.860 --> 07:25.060
I don't think we got it.

07:25.060 --> 07:26.260
I think I did it too fast.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.220
Did you guys hear this latest...

07:29.860 --> 07:31.140
Oh, wait, I kind of like that.

07:31.140 --> 07:36.020
Start the music, and Justin cut the music, and Griffin will come in strong, like a hee-haw moment.

07:36.020 --> 07:42.900
So the very first thing they'll hear is this intro music that comes loaded on the Rodecaster Pro.

07:42.900 --> 07:46.260
No matter fucking what, we aren't doing another take.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.580
This is the intro right here, no matter what.

07:48.580 --> 07:49.060
Swear it.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.420
Justin, swear it on your life.

07:50.420 --> 07:52.740
I'll swear it, but let me just get the flow.

07:53.460 --> 07:56.420
Block me through it, because I think we're so close to something new.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.900
You do the fucking music.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.900
I hop in there with a sick-ass joke.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.260
There's got to be a hard stop.

08:02.260 --> 08:02.980
No fade out.

08:02.980 --> 08:05.460
It's like, music, and then...

08:05.460 --> 08:08.740
But no matter what, this is it.

08:08.740 --> 08:09.860
Yeah, all right.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.540
Okay, so I start the music.

08:11.540 --> 08:12.420
Yeah, and then I'll do my joke.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.300
Fade it down.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.260
You bring in a joke.

08:14.260 --> 08:14.900
I fade it back up.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.340
No, no fade out.

08:16.340 --> 08:16.980
Hard stop.

08:16.980 --> 08:20.260
Fade it louder and louder and louder until it comes to a dead stop.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.100
What?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.780
And three, two, one, play.

08:23.780 --> 08:26.420
Did you guys hear this one?

08:26.420 --> 08:29.220
Fuck, fuck.

08:29.220 --> 08:31.460
You guys hear?

08:31.460 --> 08:32.420
Hold on!

08:32.420 --> 08:33.060
Don't stop it.

08:33.060 --> 08:33.460
Don't stop it.

08:33.460 --> 08:33.940
Don't stop it.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.700
Stop smoking these drugs.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.220
Come on.

08:37.220 --> 08:43.220
Did you guys hear this one about Rice Cream?

08:43.220 --> 08:44.180
He's a mummy now.

08:44.180 --> 08:46.260
He's not smart.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.140
Rice Cream is steady.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.180
He's a mummy now.

08:48.180 --> 08:50.980
He keeps his boner under wrap.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.700
Say your name, I'm Griffin McElroy.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.900
Are you on mic, Griffin?

08:56.260 --> 08:57.460
This is Griffin McElroy.

08:58.180 --> 08:59.780
I'm Travis McElroy.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.140
I'm Justin McElroy.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.460
I think in post, that's going to sound really good.

09:03.460 --> 09:03.860
Yeah.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.260
We'll just got to tighten it up and sweeten it a little bit.

09:06.260 --> 09:10.180
Yeah, so there's a little dead air, but I think if we could get out some of the tinniness...

09:10.180 --> 09:12.660
I did not notice the dead air, Travis.

09:12.660 --> 09:17.700
I'm so glad your ear is in the show because I did not notice it.

09:17.700 --> 09:22.020
I noticed it only because Griffin had to specifically call my name to tell me to talk.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.900
That was the only reason I caught that there was some dead space.

09:24.900 --> 09:28.260
Almost always a bad sign for the flow of the show.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.340
All right, let's do some fucking questions.

09:30.340 --> 09:30.980
Fuck yes.

09:30.980 --> 09:33.220
Yeah, I bet people thought that was going to be the whole episode.

09:33.220 --> 09:34.820
I bet it could feel that way sometimes.

09:34.820 --> 09:35.620
Yeah, sometimes.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.020
But it never is.

09:38.020 --> 09:38.820
I think that...

09:38.820 --> 09:39.700
Can I say something?

09:39.700 --> 09:44.660
I think that part of the reason people struggle with the introductions to this program sometimes,

09:44.660 --> 09:50.340
and why it has put off, I would estimate at this point, innumerable listeners,

09:51.140 --> 09:52.820
new listeners to the program.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.340
And old listeners.

09:54.340 --> 09:58.740
Yeah, I like to think that some of them got off the ship at some point.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.740
But I think a lot of people try.

10:00.740 --> 10:02.660
They're like, I've heard about this show, I'm going to try it.

10:02.660 --> 10:06.900
I think part of the problem with the introductions is that a few times

10:06.900 --> 10:11.780
we have started an introduction that has become an entire episode.

10:11.780 --> 10:14.980
And I think that now when you're listening to the introduction,

10:14.980 --> 10:20.500
there's this back of your throat fear that this could be the whole episode.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.140
And it's honestly, Juice, it's kind of fucked up that you are

10:23.700 --> 10:28.020
continuing to suspend those sensitive listeners to that fear.

10:28.020 --> 10:28.500
You're right.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.700
I am sorry, I'm sorry.

10:29.700 --> 10:30.500
This is show.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.740
Show has begun.

10:34.740 --> 10:38.900
Recently, a couple of friends invited me to do an escape room with them.

10:38.900 --> 10:39.940
It was kind of fun.

10:40.820 --> 10:44.500
So when they asked me again the next week, I agreed to do another one.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.220
Now they're calling the three of us an escape room team

10:47.860 --> 10:51.860
and want to do them his office twice a week, traveling across the country, different ones.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.980
I got a name for your team, the Super Spreaders.

10:55.620 --> 10:59.620
As much as I've mildly enjoyed doing these puzzles and unlocking things,

10:59.620 --> 11:04.340
I'm clearly not into this as the others and need a polite way of telling them

11:04.340 --> 11:05.620
I don't want to be in the team.

11:06.260 --> 11:09.700
No, a lot of rooms require a minimum three people.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.740
So me not being there means they can't do a lot of rooms.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.300
Bothers.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.540
That's right, supposed to be brothers.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.340
Oh, bother.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.700
How do I escape from this escape room team?

11:19.700 --> 11:22.100
Sick of solving puzzles in Scotland.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.180
You know, Juice said that about the Super Spreaders,

11:24.180 --> 11:28.180
but I will say Scotland is, I believe, in a somewhat better place than we are.

11:28.180 --> 11:28.980
Everywhere is.

11:28.980 --> 11:34.260
Yeah, why would an escape room have a minimum of people that could participate?

11:34.260 --> 11:35.860
They charge per head, eh?

11:35.860 --> 11:36.340
So-

11:36.340 --> 11:38.500
Well, but I mean, at that point, just charge a minimum.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.020
Say like, if one, hey, if you want to come, Travis, and do an escape room by yourself-

11:42.020 --> 11:43.460
Who's that asshole?

11:43.460 --> 11:46.260
I guess it's, I guess, I mean, you did say your own name.

11:46.260 --> 11:47.460
It would be me.

11:47.460 --> 11:50.100
I did want to say, before I knew that you volunteered for this,

11:50.100 --> 11:53.620
who's that asshole that's like, no one else come in.

11:53.620 --> 11:56.820
I'm going to do this one by myself.

11:56.820 --> 12:00.980
Well, if they're going to do a bad job, listen, this is the thing.

12:00.980 --> 12:03.780
I have done many, many escape rooms.

12:04.900 --> 12:10.580
And I would say, specifically, Adol, Raffi, and I have done a lot of escape rooms together.

12:11.220 --> 12:14.660
If we are at a convention at the same time, we will do escape rooms.

12:14.660 --> 12:17.540
Now, have we done escape rooms where there have been,

12:18.260 --> 12:20.500
let's say, some dead weight on the team?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.580
Yeah, totally, totally, totally.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.060
But the two of us can carry it.

12:25.060 --> 12:26.020
You know what I mean?

12:26.020 --> 12:27.220
I don't know where I'm going with this.

12:27.220 --> 12:30.660
I just wanted to brag about how good Adol, Raffi, and I are at escape rooms.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.740
Good, people love that.

12:32.740 --> 12:38.660
I think that you're very lucky to be, if I could be,

12:38.660 --> 12:42.580
if I had the kind of life where I could even entertain the fucking idea

12:42.580 --> 12:49.860
of being part of a, quote, escape room team, end quote, I would celebrate.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.580
I would celebrate, I would say a thank you prayer every morning

12:54.580 --> 12:58.020
and every night before bedtime for the cool life that I had

12:58.020 --> 13:00.980
where I could go and solve the puzzles of Puzzle Masters

13:00.980 --> 13:04.660
across this great country of ours, or world, this fucking globe of ours.

13:06.180 --> 13:09.780
I know this isn't helpful, but change your whole fucking outlook

13:09.780 --> 13:12.180
because you should like this more.

13:12.180 --> 13:13.460
I mean, it's something, isn't it?

13:14.660 --> 13:14.820
Yeah.

13:14.820 --> 13:18.260
If you go into an escape room, you know what the nicest thing about escape rooms are?

13:18.260 --> 13:23.460
If you go into an escape room, by definition, you haven't been there before.

13:23.460 --> 13:24.100
You know what I mean?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.860
Like at least it's new room.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.180
I never want to leave.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.300
This is new room.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.820
I'm so excited to be here.

13:30.820 --> 13:33.780
Let me reframe your thinking, question asker,

13:33.780 --> 13:36.740
of why escape rooms are the greatest fucking things in the world.

13:37.540 --> 13:42.580
All around us in what I'm going to call real world, non-escape rooms,

13:43.380 --> 13:46.740
there are problems that are completely unquantifiable.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.180
In escape room?

13:48.180 --> 13:49.140
What's this?

13:49.140 --> 13:52.580
Red book goes on the green bookshelf and something open?

13:52.580 --> 13:55.780
That is a quantifiable, solvable problem

13:55.780 --> 14:00.660
that when you've solved it, you can feel a little bit better about life.

14:00.660 --> 14:01.700
Feel anything.

14:02.660 --> 14:04.420
Feel anything in the escape room.

14:04.420 --> 14:07.540
Ooh, that's a good tagline for Griffin's escape rooms.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.540
Come in, feel something.

14:11.220 --> 14:11.780
Feel it.

14:13.540 --> 14:15.940
Switch that light switch on and off three times

14:16.500 --> 14:18.180
and I'll come on over the loudspeaker.

14:18.180 --> 14:21.060
I'll be like, you fucking did it.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.260
Feel it.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.700
Embrace this novelty.

14:27.060 --> 14:29.060
Did you hear that box click open?

14:29.060 --> 14:31.460
That's joy in your heart, my friend.

14:31.460 --> 14:35.060
It would be me in the escape room with a group of super solvers.

14:35.860 --> 14:38.020
Like my fam, we did an escape room.

14:38.020 --> 14:38.500
I can't remember.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.220
We were on tour last year.

14:39.220 --> 14:41.460
We did an escape room back when tour was a thing we could do.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.700
An escape room and leave house was things we could do.

14:44.340 --> 14:45.460
We solved it real fast.

14:45.460 --> 14:48.500
We got out of there like 38 minutes with a lot of time left.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.620
What time was this?

14:49.620 --> 14:54.260
This was when we were on tour in Milwaukee at the City 13.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.300
City 13.

14:55.300 --> 14:55.860
Yes.

14:55.860 --> 15:00.500
And it was that kind of like post-punk like diner.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.740
Like cyberpunk bar diner shit.

15:02.740 --> 15:03.380
Yeah, it was dope.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.580
We got out of there real fast.

15:04.580 --> 15:08.420
But these days, I probably would have like had hand on the doorknob at 38 minutes.

15:08.420 --> 15:12.980
Like, do you guys just wanna fucking kick everything?

15:12.980 --> 15:15.940
We'll do 21 minutes and 50 seconds left in here

15:15.940 --> 15:17.460
and then leave when we absolutely have to.

15:17.460 --> 15:21.300
But maybe we could just like explore the space.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.500
Sniffing air.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.300
It's new.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.780
Maybe we can leave more problems than we solve.

15:26.580 --> 15:27.380
That's cool.

15:27.380 --> 15:28.340
Create some new ones.

15:28.340 --> 15:32.100
Do you think it's a hard, you know how bad a real dangerous situation is

15:32.100 --> 15:34.660
when there's a fire at an escape room place?

15:34.660 --> 15:36.020
Not because the doors are locked or anything,

15:36.020 --> 15:37.940
because as we all know, the doors are not locked.

15:37.940 --> 15:39.620
It's the biggest lie they ever told.

15:39.620 --> 15:40.100
Wait, what?

15:40.100 --> 15:41.220
But yeah.

15:41.220 --> 15:42.660
Yeah, you just open it.

15:42.660 --> 15:45.700
If the fire alarm starts going off and you're doing an escape room,

15:45.700 --> 15:47.620
you're gonna be like, huh, okay.

15:48.820 --> 15:49.300
How did I?

15:50.820 --> 15:52.500
Hey, Valerie, do that again.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.620
Step on that again, because maybe it'll turn it off.

15:55.620 --> 15:56.980
I don't know what it means.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.500
Count the flashes.

15:59.220 --> 16:03.060
That is the thing, I wonder how there's gotta be a study somewhere

16:03.060 --> 16:08.020
on how doing fire drills has ruined anybody's reaction to actual like fire alarms.

16:08.020 --> 16:11.060
Because now as an adult, if I'm in a place and I hear a fire alarm,

16:11.060 --> 16:14.020
the first words out of my mouth are, it's probably not real.

16:14.020 --> 16:15.220
Oh, what an asshole.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.180
What asshole did this?

16:16.740 --> 16:19.860
I think if I ran an escape room and I was staffing up,

16:19.860 --> 16:22.980
I would hire somebody and the first day would be business as usual.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.660
I'd be like, you lock up tonight.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.260
And then when they tried to leave that night,

16:26.260 --> 16:29.380
they would find that the front door was locked from the outside.

16:29.380 --> 16:29.860
Okay.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.700
The test, the true test begins now.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.300
I am almost certain.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.420
I am describing the plot of the escape room horror movie.

16:38.420 --> 16:39.380
I think that's true.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.860
If I was hiring for an escape room,

16:41.860 --> 16:45.620
I would hire a plant that anytime a group started,

16:45.620 --> 16:47.620
they go in there with 10, suddenly there's 11 people,

16:47.620 --> 16:48.500
but there's a lot going on.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.260
So maybe they don't notice the extra person.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.260
And the extra person's job is to just go like,

16:52.260 --> 16:54.260
I don't think we're gonna solve this one, guys.

16:54.260 --> 16:57.700
And just like really talk up how hard the puzzles are.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.140
And like, oh, wait, hold on.

16:59.860 --> 17:01.460
Nope, nope, this isn't doing it.

17:01.460 --> 17:02.740
Fuck, I thought we had it.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.660
No, I don't think we're solving this one, guys.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.740
At some point they could pretend to die.

17:06.740 --> 17:08.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:08.180 --> 17:08.820
Yeah.

17:08.820 --> 17:13.540
And they would use their core field to turn sunlight

17:13.540 --> 17:14.020
into energy.

17:14.020 --> 17:15.460
It's not a real plant, Justin.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.340
Goes to visit his mommy.

17:18.340 --> 17:20.820
Oh, can I say one other thing?

17:20.820 --> 17:21.780
Can I help the person?

17:21.780 --> 17:22.740
Can we do one thing?

17:22.740 --> 17:24.020
Has concerns he forgets them.

17:24.020 --> 17:26.500
It's really, actually, can I say, you can't.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.860
It would be fucking wild to interrupt Travis now.

17:29.860 --> 17:31.620
And remembers being small.

17:31.620 --> 17:34.580
It feels wrong to do, but I did want to say something.

17:34.580 --> 17:38.900
Justin, the team will know if you don't want to do it

17:38.900 --> 17:42.260
because your puzzle performance will suffer.

17:42.260 --> 17:46.100
Playing under the table and fishing.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.700
Welcome to Under the Table and Fishing.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.300
Was he eating a sandwich?

17:49.300 --> 17:52.340
Was Dave eating a full turkey wrap?

17:52.340 --> 17:54.820
Oh, I was eating a sandwich.

17:54.820 --> 17:56.500
It was an egg salad.

17:58.420 --> 18:00.740
This is just a really good opportunity for you to bust out

18:00.740 --> 18:02.500
like a, I don't eat too much.

18:02.500 --> 18:10.340
I eat too much, drink too much, want too much, too much.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.060
How did Dave Matthews' picnic get ruined?

18:13.940 --> 18:14.660
How?

18:14.660 --> 18:16.420
Oh, and smart shit.

18:16.420 --> 18:17.380
And they had boners?

18:18.420 --> 18:19.380
All over it.

18:19.380 --> 18:20.500
Their dicks were out.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.020
They're all over it, dicks.

18:22.020 --> 18:22.420
So.

18:22.420 --> 18:22.980
Yeah, dude.

18:24.580 --> 18:28.580
In Under the Table and Fishing, I'm gonna read you some lyrics.

18:28.580 --> 18:30.740
They might be Dave Matthews, they might be fish.

18:30.740 --> 18:34.740
And this week, special twist, there's one by Third Eye Blind.

18:35.620 --> 18:36.260
Okay.

18:36.260 --> 18:39.220
I know, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna bloodhound that one out.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.340
So let's start.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.820
Don't let it get away.

18:43.380 --> 18:46.100
And if we did, we're gonna get it back.

18:46.100 --> 18:50.020
And in time, you and me, we will, we will, we will,

18:50.020 --> 18:52.980
we will be over and again and again.

18:53.620 --> 18:54.260
That's Dave.

18:55.220 --> 18:57.700
That feels fish?

18:58.660 --> 18:59.380
That feels fish.

18:59.380 --> 19:00.180
Fish.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.380
That is Dave Matthews.

19:01.380 --> 19:02.180
Again and again.

19:03.460 --> 19:03.860
All right.

19:05.140 --> 19:08.020
I've been prepping for this segment by listening to every Dave Matthews song

19:08.020 --> 19:09.940
and every Fish song.

19:09.940 --> 19:10.580
And does anybody have that?

19:10.580 --> 19:11.780
Oh, that's why I was sad.

19:11.780 --> 19:12.280
Anvil.

19:14.740 --> 19:16.260
Travis, can I do my joke, please?

19:16.260 --> 19:17.220
Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.

19:19.380 --> 19:23.300
I've been prepping for this segment by listening to every Dave Matthews band song

19:23.300 --> 19:24.340
and every Fish song.

19:24.340 --> 19:29.540
And I have, now I have the munchies.

19:29.540 --> 19:32.820
Fuck, wow, man.

19:32.820 --> 19:33.940
Oh, yeah.

19:33.940 --> 19:34.740
Fucking yeah.

19:35.860 --> 19:36.900
Dude, yeah.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.660
I guess I just don't follow Justin.

19:38.660 --> 19:39.940
Pass the incense.

19:39.940 --> 19:40.440
Okay.

19:41.380 --> 19:41.880
Okay.

19:42.660 --> 19:43.620
Here's another one.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.940
Bang, bang, you're dead now, could be real.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.500
I got a bag of smoke.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.340
Come on, let's make a deal.

19:52.340 --> 19:55.620
Yeah, fish, fish, fish.

19:56.980 --> 20:01.860
Yeah, bridges burn, but tomorrow is another day to feed the world

20:01.860 --> 20:03.700
and go outside and play.

20:03.700 --> 20:04.260
No, Dave.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.500
I'm flipping on it.

20:08.020 --> 20:10.020
I'm gonna stick with Fish.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.380
That is Dave.

20:11.380 --> 20:13.780
I thought, let's say he twisted it on me.

20:13.780 --> 20:18.180
He thought I want to write the first stanza as though I were Fish

20:18.180 --> 20:20.340
and the second stanza as though I were Dave.

20:20.340 --> 20:23.940
Mm-hmm, we built a kingdom out of lies

20:24.500 --> 20:27.060
and then we blindly fanned the fires.

20:27.620 --> 20:30.660
We warmed our hands with glowing coals,

20:30.660 --> 20:33.460
but now they rain down from the skies.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.380
Third eye.

20:35.380 --> 20:36.500
Third eye, they're in line.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.540
Yeah, third eye blind.

20:37.540 --> 20:38.260
That is Fish.

20:38.980 --> 20:39.300
Damn.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.420
The song is leaves.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.980
I am 0 for 3 right now.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.260
I used to be good at this game.

20:45.300 --> 20:48.580
Because of you, girl, beautiful, beautiful girl,

20:48.580 --> 20:51.780
take it easy on yourself and make it easy on me.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.700
Because I just want to make you,

20:53.700 --> 20:55.140
I just want to make you,

20:55.140 --> 20:58.580
come on, come on, come on, come.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.980
That's, that's-

21:04.100 --> 21:05.700
It's not Fish.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.060
It's not Fish.

21:07.060 --> 21:10.660
I'm going to suppose that it is one of Dave Matthews'

21:11.300 --> 21:12.980
many songs about fingering.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.500
It's so Dave.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.980
That is one of Dave's hornier tracks.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.060
It's called come on, come on.

21:20.180 --> 21:20.500
Okay.

21:21.460 --> 21:24.580
So that's 4 for Justin, 1 for Griffin.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.100
In case you're wondering, yes,

21:26.100 --> 21:28.100
Crash is one of the fingering champs.

21:28.100 --> 21:28.660
Yes, of course.

21:28.660 --> 21:29.460
Because he's written Minion.

21:29.460 --> 21:30.740
What a horror song.

21:30.740 --> 21:34.900
Press me down, then I pressurize, then I rise up.

21:34.900 --> 21:38.020
Like diamonds, rise up all you diamonds.

21:38.020 --> 21:40.820
So rise up, rise up all you diamonds.

21:40.820 --> 21:43.140
Pressurize all you diamonds.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.500
Third eye, it doesn't feel like Fish or Dave Matthews' band,

21:46.500 --> 21:48.900
so I am going to hit third eye blind on this one.

21:48.900 --> 21:53.140
I want third eye blind.

21:53.140 --> 21:54.820
It is third eye blind, correct.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:56.580 --> 22:00.100
There is the tower like a solitary flower

22:00.740 --> 22:01.940
standing in the snow

22:04.180 --> 22:05.860
as the wolves all wait below

22:06.500 --> 22:10.580
and you're walking on the ledge, throwing bread crusts off the edge.

22:12.020 --> 22:13.300
That feels Fishy to me.

22:13.300 --> 22:18.660
I was thrown at first because the use of tower and then flower

22:18.660 --> 22:20.980
made me feel like this is probably a phallic,

22:21.780 --> 22:24.260
sexual Dave Matthews song about sex.

22:25.780 --> 22:26.980
But I am going to switch to Fish.

22:28.020 --> 22:28.740
It is Fish.

22:29.780 --> 22:30.660
Okay, yeah.

22:30.660 --> 22:34.180
And I do want to point out Dave Matthews' songs aren't phallic.

22:34.180 --> 22:34.420
No.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.260
He only writes about fingering.

22:36.260 --> 22:36.420
Yeah.

22:37.860 --> 22:40.420
Well, a finger could be a tower as well, I guess.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.620
I guess, sure.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.780
Okay, it's not what anybody's thinking of.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.980
Let's be honest.

22:44.980 --> 22:47.940
I love your hair in the mornings, you know.

22:47.940 --> 22:50.580
You love to run wild and let the mane flow,

22:51.300 --> 22:54.340
but you run away, but we meet again soon

22:54.980 --> 22:57.220
south of the border and over the moon.

22:57.780 --> 22:58.660
Dave Matthews, man.

22:59.380 --> 22:59.700
Fish.

23:00.660 --> 23:01.700
That's Fish.

23:01.700 --> 23:02.020
Shade.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.220
Wow.

23:03.220 --> 23:06.260
It was, and I could tell because it was kind of horny,

23:06.260 --> 23:10.340
but not, it doesn't, Dave's gonna finish.

23:10.340 --> 23:14.580
You know what I mean?

23:14.580 --> 23:16.020
Okay, this is my question.

23:16.020 --> 23:16.500
Okay.

23:16.500 --> 23:20.420
Are all song lyrics the same or do the two of them

23:20.420 --> 23:23.060
just have a lot of crossover tonally?

23:23.060 --> 23:26.100
I think that the reason I do this whole segment

23:26.100 --> 23:28.500
is because they have a lot of crossover tonally, Justin.

23:29.780 --> 23:31.860
All right, I'm gonna do this Yahoo now.

23:31.860 --> 23:33.780
It's sent in by Merritt Palmer, the prospector.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.580
Thank you, prospector.

23:36.020 --> 23:40.020
It is from Yahoo Answers user, Christopher,

23:40.020 --> 23:41.700
who asks, and this one might be kind of quick.

23:42.900 --> 23:47.140
Should the laugh track on sitcoms be just one person

23:47.140 --> 23:48.900
instead of a crowd of laughter?

23:48.900 --> 23:49.400
Ooh.

23:50.420 --> 23:54.180
Now, do you guys think they mean one person across all sitcoms

23:54.180 --> 23:55.780
or one person per sitcom?

23:56.980 --> 23:58.100
You mean the same person.

23:58.100 --> 23:58.500
Yes.

23:58.500 --> 24:02.340
Is it like Dave's track and Dave does the laugh for everyone

24:02.340 --> 24:04.260
or is it like, well, Dave goes with friends

24:04.820 --> 24:07.460
and Steven goes with Big Bang Theory?

24:07.460 --> 24:12.500
I am interested in the idea of the laugher

24:12.500 --> 24:16.340
being someone we, like, become familiar with as a nation.

24:16.340 --> 24:18.580
Right, I like, yeah.

24:18.580 --> 24:22.660
This is Terrence and, but they can't,

24:22.660 --> 24:26.420
the problem is there's never an episode of Big Bang Theory

24:26.420 --> 24:29.460
where the audience isn't super into it.

24:29.460 --> 24:30.020
Do you know what I mean?

24:30.020 --> 24:30.820
They're loving it.

24:30.820 --> 24:32.020
That should be a thing.

24:32.020 --> 24:34.660
It's like there's an episode of Big Bang Theory

24:34.660 --> 24:38.100
where just Sheldon does his thing, like, you know,

24:38.100 --> 24:40.580
he pisses his pants and then he's like, bazinga,

24:40.580 --> 24:42.980
and the audience is just like, yeah.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.220
Well, but think about that, right?

24:45.220 --> 24:47.460
Like, usually Terrence is loving it, right?

24:47.460 --> 24:49.780
But then there's an episode where the thing Sheldon did

24:49.780 --> 24:51.140
you thought was pretty funny,

24:51.140 --> 24:54.100
but Terrence didn't see him as a fear.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.140
So what's that mean?

24:55.140 --> 24:55.620
What's that mean?

24:55.620 --> 24:57.140
It's like, is Terrence okay?

24:57.140 --> 24:57.780
What's going on?

24:57.780 --> 24:58.980
That is the problem, right?

24:58.980 --> 25:01.780
Is you would start to have more insight

25:01.780 --> 25:05.540
and probably concern about the real man Terrence

25:06.180 --> 25:08.900
than you would about the bazinga guys,

25:08.900 --> 25:11.140
the bazinga gals over at Big Bang Theory.

25:11.140 --> 25:14.020
And I think eventually you end up like campaigning

25:14.020 --> 25:16.980
to get the camera back at the back of the audience

25:16.980 --> 25:19.380
so I could see Terrence in his chair

25:19.380 --> 25:23.380
while I'm watching them do, you know, their science

25:23.380 --> 25:25.700
and like jokes about the Green Lantern and stuff.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.460
But we're talking about multi-camera sitcom shows.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.540
That's going to be a tough nut to putt.

25:29.540 --> 25:30.100
That's cool.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.780
You have to aim them all through Terrence.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.820
Can we just take a second to appreciate tough nut to putt

25:34.820 --> 25:37.460
as the new powerful slogan for something?

25:38.020 --> 25:40.180
I think maybe instead we just get

25:40.180 --> 25:43.300
at the top of every episode of every sitcom,

25:43.300 --> 25:46.100
we get about two minutes interview with Terrence

25:46.660 --> 25:48.500
just to see how he's doing.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.940
And most of the time,

25:49.940 --> 25:52.500
I imagine this is sort of a poet laureate position,

25:53.620 --> 25:56.900
sort of venerated where we can trust his sort of opinions

25:56.900 --> 26:00.020
about comedy and jokes and laughing and stuff.

26:00.020 --> 26:01.300
So when he sits up there and he's like,

26:01.300 --> 26:03.620
hey guys, it's me, Terrence, all strapped in,

26:03.620 --> 26:05.780
ready for another fucking great episode of Big,

26:05.780 --> 26:06.580
they wouldn't say fucking,

26:06.580 --> 26:08.100
but ready to laugh at another great episode of Big Bang Theory.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.060
No, maybe with Terrence there's no censorship.

26:11.060 --> 26:13.940
We want unbridled, unfiltered Terrence.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.540
Okay, but then you know like,

26:15.540 --> 26:17.140
okay, so if Terrence laughs during this one,

26:18.100 --> 26:19.460
it's okay for me and all my pals

26:19.460 --> 26:21.460
at this Big Bang party that I'm throwing,

26:22.500 --> 26:24.660
which is a Big Bang Theory watch party,

26:24.660 --> 26:27.220
and then we're all gonna have, we're all gonna fuck later.

26:28.580 --> 26:29.940
It's okay for us to laugh.

26:29.940 --> 26:31.540
But then if you see an interview with him

26:31.540 --> 26:33.780
before an episode of Frasier 2,

26:34.340 --> 26:37.860
and he's like, ah, hey guys, yeah, my cat's sick.

26:38.420 --> 26:40.260
Anyway, let's get on with the show.

26:41.460 --> 26:42.420
Then you know like,

26:42.420 --> 26:44.740
it's okay that I'm laughing when Terrence doesn't.

26:45.380 --> 26:47.220
Do you think that the risk would become

26:47.220 --> 26:49.620
that TV shows would start to be developed

26:49.620 --> 26:51.380
specifically with Terrence in mind?

26:51.940 --> 26:53.940
Where it'd be like, what's Terrence like?

26:53.940 --> 26:54.500
What's here?

26:54.500 --> 26:56.260
We gotta get in front of Terrence, people.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.220
Tell me the name of Terrence's third grade teacher.

26:59.220 --> 27:01.860
Give me all the information you can on Terrence.

27:04.900 --> 27:10.500
Do you guys think there is a static number of days

27:11.700 --> 27:16.180
after the series finale of Big Bang Theory,

27:16.180 --> 27:20.980
at which point we will stop referencing Big Bang Theory

27:20.980 --> 27:22.980
as an ongoing concern?

27:22.980 --> 27:26.420
Because currently, by my math,

27:26.420 --> 27:28.500
it has been roughly

27:33.140 --> 27:37.620
maybe 450 days by the calendar

27:37.620 --> 27:41.460
since the final episode on May 16th, 2019.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.900
Can I tell you the problem here, Jameon?

27:43.620 --> 27:44.500
Problem is-

27:44.500 --> 27:46.180
I think I know the problem, Trav.

27:46.180 --> 27:48.020
Is that I can't think of another TV show?

27:48.740 --> 27:49.060
Right.

27:49.060 --> 27:49.300
Yeah.

27:49.940 --> 27:52.740
Are there other ones that are going on right now?

27:52.740 --> 27:53.780
Not on that scale.

27:53.780 --> 27:55.460
I mean, listen, we can talk about Supernatural,

27:55.460 --> 27:57.620
but that's not a multi-camera comedy.

27:57.620 --> 28:00.100
Again, please don't talk about Supernatural.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.260
I'm just saying it's been a year and a half since.

28:02.260 --> 28:04.180
First off, do you guys feel like...

28:07.620 --> 28:08.260
Okay.

28:08.260 --> 28:11.940
Do you feel like the nation mourned Big Bang Theory enough?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.180
Because everyone has been very excited

28:14.180 --> 28:16.660
about Big Bang Theory's existence,

28:16.660 --> 28:21.540
but did the nation mourn Big Bang Theory's passion?

28:21.540 --> 28:23.060
Because I feel like I didn't see

28:23.060 --> 28:27.220
the funeral for a friend proceedings

28:27.220 --> 28:32.500
that one would expect from saying goodbye to characters here.

28:32.500 --> 28:36.020
Well, I think we're in the stage where a loved one passes

28:36.020 --> 28:38.740
and you spend a lot of time watching old home movies.

28:41.140 --> 28:45.380
Except in this case, it's like 800 episodes of reruns.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.740
So it takes a while to get through those home movies

28:48.740 --> 28:49.860
before you're like,

28:49.860 --> 28:52.900
oh, you know what, I don't really miss that loved one anymore.

28:52.900 --> 28:53.460
That's it.

28:53.460 --> 28:57.460
It's gonna come to us 2035

28:58.340 --> 29:01.220
when someone's gonna accidentally say Bazinga

29:01.220 --> 29:04.500
and it'll be like, oh, and then the cavity will feel it.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.020
And just to answer your question with another perspective,

29:08.020 --> 29:10.820
it has been, to my actual math,

29:11.700 --> 29:15.780
nearly 6,000 days since Frasier went off the air.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.060
Fair.

29:17.060 --> 29:21.060
Fair, but I think when we talk about Frasier,

29:21.060 --> 29:27.620
it is tinged with where the age is folded into the rhythm.

29:27.620 --> 29:28.260
Right, okay.

29:28.260 --> 29:31.780
And I feel like Big Bang Theory is our reach

29:31.780 --> 29:33.700
for current ongoing.

29:33.700 --> 29:36.580
Okay, fair, this is a fair point, Justin,

29:36.580 --> 29:39.700
because I did go, when I first started this,

29:39.700 --> 29:41.620
I said something about Friends and I thought,

29:41.620 --> 29:43.380
but Friends is canceled.

29:43.380 --> 29:45.780
I need to talk about an ongoing show.

29:45.780 --> 29:48.100
I know Big Bang Theory.

29:48.100 --> 29:52.820
But I really blame, I don't blame me or you,

29:52.820 --> 29:56.100
I blame the nation for not mourning the gang.

29:56.100 --> 29:57.620
I feel like the gang passed.

29:59.460 --> 30:01.540
Can I tell you guys an interesting fact, please?

30:01.540 --> 30:05.700
12 and a half million people watched Big Bang Theory

30:05.700 --> 30:12.260
on May 9th, which was the week before the show ended, okay?

30:12.260 --> 30:15.060
Okay. The finale episode,

30:15.060 --> 30:19.940
18 and a half million people tuned in for that final ep.

30:20.980 --> 30:26.900
So that means that here in this great nation of ours,

30:26.900 --> 30:31.220
there are 6 million discrete humans, give or take,

30:31.780 --> 30:36.660
who are like, listen, I don't watch Big Bang Theory,

30:36.660 --> 30:38.820
but I'm gonna be there when they put it in the fucking ground.

30:38.820 --> 30:42.100
Yeah. I wanna make sure you stay dead.

30:42.100 --> 30:45.620
Stay dead, Sheldon. Stay dead, glasses.

30:46.340 --> 30:47.940
Stay dead, other girl.

30:47.940 --> 30:50.100
I just don't get, with numbers like that,

30:50.100 --> 30:51.220
why they canceled it.

30:51.860 --> 30:53.140
Why did they even cancel it?

30:53.140 --> 30:55.140
Why did they cancel Big Bang Theory?

30:55.140 --> 30:58.660
Well, because they wanted to rope in those 6 million people

30:58.660 --> 31:00.500
who are like, I don't watch the show,

31:01.140 --> 31:02.980
but I will be there when it dies.

31:02.980 --> 31:08.420
I wanna be there when the plug is pulled on Green Lantern

31:08.420 --> 31:13.060
and the flash shirt guy and everybody.

31:13.060 --> 31:16.100
Why did they cancel shows like Big Bang Theory and Friends?

31:16.660 --> 31:17.700
I don't get it.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.780
Now, Travis, you're being silly.

31:19.780 --> 31:23.380
You know I'm a bit more savvy about what happens

31:24.820 --> 31:29.620
behind that beautiful lens that makes the Friends and the Frasier.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.500
And so this is how they do it.

31:32.500 --> 31:32.820
Okay.

31:33.620 --> 31:37.700
Hey, everybody, come with us to CBS as we mourn

31:37.700 --> 31:39.860
the passing of Big Bang Theory, a show you don't watch,

31:39.860 --> 31:40.500
but you should.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.500
People are going to ask you,

31:42.500 --> 31:44.340
where were you when Big Bang Theory went off the air?

31:44.340 --> 31:45.620
So please come and watch it.

31:45.620 --> 31:49.140
And then 11 million people were like, yes, yes.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.060
It sounds like a Friday night to me.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.140
And they showed up and they watched it.

31:53.140 --> 31:56.020
And then at the end, everybody else dies,

31:56.020 --> 31:59.300
but Sheldon crawls inside of his reverse chrysalis

31:59.860 --> 32:01.620
and becomes Young Sheldon.

32:01.620 --> 32:08.020
And now that's 11 million built-in viewers of Young Sheldon.

32:08.020 --> 32:09.780
Big Bang Theory never went off the air

32:09.780 --> 32:12.500
because it's carried on in the memories of the past

32:12.500 --> 32:15.460
of the character of Sheldon.

32:15.460 --> 32:20.100
The chrysalis is reforming around Sheldon.

32:20.980 --> 32:26.580
He will reemerge with a new Big Bang Theory once he has matured.

32:26.580 --> 32:30.100
You know, I was going to point out that after Cheers,

32:30.100 --> 32:32.980
they spun off a series called Frasier.

32:33.780 --> 32:35.220
And that was also popular.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.780
And I thought, why doesn't every popular sitcom do that?

32:37.780 --> 32:41.060
And then I remembered that Joey was a concern for a while.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.100
Love Joey.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.620
And that kind of answered my question.

32:45.620 --> 32:47.460
Love Joey.

32:49.060 --> 32:50.020
Sandwiches.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.500
Italian sandwiches.

32:56.420 --> 32:59.940
He had a lot of premarital sex.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.260
Premarital sex.

33:03.780 --> 33:06.180
And he was always interested in people's well-being.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.700
He was always like, hey, how are you?

33:07.700 --> 33:08.500
How are you doing?

33:09.620 --> 33:16.420
Uninvited sexual energy, but we loved it, I guess.

33:16.420 --> 33:18.660
We really liked all the gay panic.

33:18.660 --> 33:19.300
That was fun.

33:19.300 --> 33:20.340
Gay panic, Joey.

33:21.380 --> 33:22.340
Oh, don't touch me.

33:22.340 --> 33:23.140
You're a guy.

33:23.140 --> 33:23.940
You know, that kind of thing.

33:23.940 --> 33:24.180
Yeah.

33:24.180 --> 33:24.980
Oh, what are we?

33:24.980 --> 33:25.940
Oh.

33:25.940 --> 33:26.420
What are we?

33:26.420 --> 33:27.460
Oh, what if we hugged?

33:27.460 --> 33:28.260
That'd be so gay.

33:28.260 --> 33:31.380
You know, that kind of, you get it.

33:31.380 --> 33:32.580
How aren't you doing?

33:32.580 --> 33:34.580
Because you're a guy, Joey.

33:36.180 --> 33:36.660
You get it.

33:36.660 --> 33:40.180
Ladies and gentlemen, as Joey's dad, Christopher Walken, apparently.

33:41.540 --> 33:44.020
Griffin, what would it be like if Joey and Joey's dad hugged?

33:45.140 --> 33:47.460
Just this one time, Joey, my boy.

33:49.140 --> 33:53.060
As it turns out, if I try to do Joey from Friends, I can sort of

33:54.900 --> 33:56.980
sidestep my way into Christopher Walken,

33:56.980 --> 33:59.300
which is an exciting revelation for me.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.100
Let's take a break.

34:00.660 --> 34:03.700
If I'm going to afford the box set of Joey on DVD,

34:04.580 --> 34:06.420
I need to earn some money.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.020
It's half of one disc.

34:09.060 --> 34:12.740
There's a label on the front of the case saying, this is sharp.

34:12.740 --> 34:16.580
Please, if you are the type of person who just bought Joey on half a DVD,

34:16.580 --> 34:19.220
you shouldn't touch it because it's real sharp.

34:19.780 --> 34:24.340
Please affix this to half of a corn tortilla.

34:24.340 --> 34:27.220
It's a function and spin.

34:27.220 --> 34:30.340
The other half of the disc is just all the episodes of the cape

34:30.340 --> 34:32.180
and you can kind of glue it together.

34:32.180 --> 34:36.740
And then as you spin, the cape makes some special appearances on Joey.

34:36.740 --> 34:39.460
It combines them stereoscopically.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.940
So it looks like Joey's wearing a cape.

34:41.940 --> 34:42.820
It's incredible.

34:42.820 --> 34:45.780
You plugged this half of the Joey DVD disc

34:45.780 --> 34:57.140
into Sonic and Knuckles expansion pack for Sega Genesis.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.140
Hey, can I tell you all about me undies?

35:03.140 --> 35:03.620
Yeah.

35:03.620 --> 35:06.100
I'm hearing a lot of background activity.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.780
It makes me wonder if somebody's...

35:07.780 --> 35:10.820
It sounded like somebody was wrapping a present, if I'm being honest.

35:10.820 --> 35:12.820
And I guess the question is, is it for me?

35:12.820 --> 35:14.020
Yeah, if it's underwear.

35:14.580 --> 35:15.220
Thank you.

35:15.220 --> 35:15.700
Yeah.

35:15.700 --> 35:16.340
Happy day.

35:16.340 --> 35:16.740
Thank you.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.140
I will always accept underwear if it's me undies

35:19.140 --> 35:20.900
because if it's not, it's trash.

35:20.900 --> 35:23.860
And that's my new motto that they can use whenever they want.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.540
They are the most comfortable underwear.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.980
You're saying if a stranger walked up to you and said,

35:28.980 --> 35:32.820
here, take this pair of me undies, no questions asked,

35:32.820 --> 35:33.540
you would do it?

35:34.180 --> 35:34.420
Yeah.

35:34.980 --> 35:35.380
Wow.

35:35.380 --> 35:35.540
Yeah.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.460
Yeah, they're pretty comfortable.

35:37.460 --> 35:38.660
Travis, I think it's kind of fucked up

35:38.660 --> 35:41.060
that in the middle of our commercial for me undies,

35:41.060 --> 35:42.340
you would suggest otherwise.

35:42.340 --> 35:45.140
But anyway, I have so many me undies right now.

35:45.140 --> 35:46.500
And what I really like about them

35:46.500 --> 35:48.740
is because it is the spookiest season of the year,

35:48.740 --> 35:50.900
I love to look scary down there.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.860
And so I have some that have fun.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.700
They're fun at the end of the day,

35:55.700 --> 35:58.180
but they are still pretty spooky Halloween prints.

35:58.180 --> 35:58.740
Yeah.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.860
If you're into cats or blood or skeletons,

36:01.860 --> 36:05.460
in a spooky context, or hell,

36:05.460 --> 36:07.460
you can wear skeleton underwear whenever.

36:07.460 --> 36:09.060
No one's gonna call the cops on you.

36:09.060 --> 36:12.260
These are just, they're so fucking soft.

36:12.260 --> 36:13.860
And you never have to run out of me undies

36:13.860 --> 36:15.140
if you get the me undies membership.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.540

36:30.420 --> 36:31.940
Can I tell you about Stitch Fix?

36:31.940 --> 36:32.500
Yep.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.860
I got the greatest shirt,

36:35.860 --> 36:41.380
the greatest shirt, my new favorite shirt from Stitch Fix.

36:41.380 --> 36:43.620
And we talk about with Stitch Fix,

36:43.620 --> 36:44.820
if you've heard us talk about it before,

36:44.820 --> 36:48.260
that they get to know your style and your budget

36:48.260 --> 36:50.180
and the colors you like, all of those things.

36:50.180 --> 36:54.580
And this felt like getting a gift from my best friend,

36:54.580 --> 36:57.060
where it was this really beautiful dress shirt

36:57.060 --> 36:59.620
that had kind of a little bit of almost like a firework,

36:59.620 --> 37:01.060
like popcorn design in.

37:01.060 --> 37:03.060
But as part of the fireworks and popcorn

37:03.060 --> 37:06.260
was like little tiny skulls in there,

37:06.260 --> 37:08.180
it was so fucking cool.

37:08.180 --> 37:09.140
That is cool.

37:09.140 --> 37:10.340
Yes, I love it.

37:10.340 --> 37:14.260
And I saw it and I ran into the room where Teresa was

37:14.260 --> 37:15.700
to say like, look at this.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.500
Because Stitch Fix is a personal styling company

37:18.500 --> 37:20.820
that makes getting the clothes you love effortless

37:20.820 --> 37:22.500
and they really do get to know you.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.500
You can go through and say like, I like this shirt.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.100
This is the kind of thing I want to dress for.

37:26.740 --> 37:28.740
This is what I like to do, that kind of thing.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.860
And it feels really personalized to you.

37:31.860 --> 37:34.580
And you pay a $20 styling fee for each fix

37:34.580 --> 37:36.180
and it's credited towards anything you keep.

37:36.740 --> 37:38.260

37:38.260 --> 37:39.460

37:39.460 --> 37:41.060
this didn't fit, you send it back.

Do you quake uncontrollably,

38:08.020 --> 38:10.180
even thinking about watching cable news?

38:10.820 --> 38:12.980
Do you have disturbing nightmares

38:12.980 --> 38:16.100
only to realize it's two in the afternoon and you're up?

38:17.060 --> 38:19.220
If you've experienced one or more of these symptoms,

38:19.220 --> 38:23.620
you may have FNO, news overload.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.300
Fortunately, there's treatment.

38:25.300 --> 38:29.060
Hi, I'm Dave Holmes, host of Troubled Waters.

38:53.780 --> 38:55.300
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

38:55.300 --> 38:56.100
howl.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.540
Oh, oh, God.

38:57.540 --> 38:59.140
Duh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

38:59.140 --> 38:59.940
Howl.

38:59.940 --> 39:00.740
Travis, run.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.060
I'm already gone.

39:03.060 --> 39:06.980
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.900
I want to munch.

39:08.900 --> 39:09.400
Huh.

39:10.660 --> 39:11.160
Squad.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.900
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

39:14.900 --> 39:17.140
I want to munch.

39:17.140 --> 39:17.860
Squad.

39:17.860 --> 39:20.340
Huh, I don't like this guy.

39:20.340 --> 39:21.620
I love this guy, fuck it.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.220
Welcome to munch, squad.

39:23.220 --> 39:27.300
Wait, wait, I formally invite you into our podcast.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.620
Beautiful spirit.

39:29.620 --> 39:30.900
Oh, is he a vampire?

39:30.900 --> 39:33.940
I thought he was like a Frankenstein's monster.

39:33.940 --> 39:36.180
Not just any vampire.

39:36.180 --> 39:37.860
The Donut Dracula.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.660
The Donut Dracula?

39:40.660 --> 39:41.700
Count Donut.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.540
Did you just change your name?

39:46.660 --> 39:49.940
It's a long name, so I'm getting it all out.

39:49.940 --> 39:52.100
So is it Count Donut Dracula?

39:52.100 --> 39:56.020
I think he said Donut Dracula, Count Donut.

39:56.020 --> 40:00.740
Oh, so his real name is Donut Dracula, but his title is Count Donut.

40:00.740 --> 40:05.860
My real name is Kevin, but knowing that would give you immense power over me.

40:05.860 --> 40:06.580
Oh, okay, Kevin.

40:06.580 --> 40:08.420
Kevin, just sit still for just a second.

40:08.420 --> 40:10.980
Trap, just to explain what just happened.

40:10.980 --> 40:15.220
Justin, in his mind, was trying to run the calculus on whether or not the word

40:15.220 --> 40:20.020
donut sounded enough like count that he could say it in lieu of count.

40:20.020 --> 40:22.260
So he said it out loud and heard it, and then he said,

40:23.060 --> 40:24.420
nobody's gonna understand what that meant.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.780
No, no, no, it's way different.

40:25.780 --> 40:28.020
So he switched it over to Count Donut.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.780
Donutula, though, I think maybe-

40:29.780 --> 40:31.140
Donutula is also nothing.

40:31.140 --> 40:33.380
I think he did the best with what he had to work with.

40:33.380 --> 40:33.940
Like, I'm not-

40:33.940 --> 40:42.340
I am the guest host for this most delicious episode of Munch, Squad,

40:42.340 --> 40:51.140
podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

40:51.140 --> 40:52.740
Hey, Count Donut, just real quick.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.260
You're better at this than Justin is.

40:55.460 --> 40:56.020
Thank you.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.420
I'm glad I killed him.

40:58.420 --> 40:58.920
What?

40:59.620 --> 41:05.460
You also sound a little bit like Gru from the Minions movies.

41:05.460 --> 41:05.860
Oh, I love those.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.860
I have not seen him, hardly.

41:07.860 --> 41:13.380
I missed the first few, and I didn't know where to jump on.

41:13.380 --> 41:16.820
Yeah, you can get pretty lost if you just come in on to Sicilumi 3.

41:16.820 --> 41:17.860
There's three now.

41:17.860 --> 41:18.900
I think so.

41:18.900 --> 41:22.100
Well, they also made a standalone Minions film.

41:23.300 --> 41:29.940
I was so excited about the new Minions movie, but then it's got delayed to 2021.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.620
Oh, yeah, it's this coronavirus.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.420
Have you heard about this?

41:33.860 --> 41:34.820
Are you having trouble with this?

41:35.700 --> 41:37.300
Everyone's in their homes.

41:37.300 --> 41:38.500
It's a challenging time.

41:38.500 --> 41:42.020
And with a mask on, it's probably hard to sink your teethers into their neck.

41:42.020 --> 41:43.380
You're wearing a mask, right, Count?

41:44.500 --> 41:46.020
Of course I am.

41:46.020 --> 41:54.340
I am immune to all earthly pathogens, but I want to set a good example.

41:54.340 --> 41:55.220
That's good.

41:55.220 --> 41:55.940
Have you voted?

41:57.220 --> 41:57.940
Have you voted?

41:58.500 --> 42:02.420
Yes, I voted long ago for the devil.

42:03.460 --> 42:07.060
No, it's a presidential election, and there's a lot of

42:07.060 --> 42:07.620
politics in it.

42:07.620 --> 42:11.540
Are you a citizen of nowhere?

42:11.540 --> 42:14.500
Oh, so you're just living here rent-free, not paying taxes?

42:14.500 --> 42:15.060
What the fuck?

42:16.020 --> 42:23.620
I am talking to you from my home in Donutvania.

42:23.620 --> 42:24.820
Oh, okay.

42:24.820 --> 42:27.700
Yeah, Trav, we need to let him speak because I am curious of what he's doing here.

42:27.700 --> 42:29.540
Oh, right, I forgot that this was a segment.

42:29.540 --> 42:29.860
Yeah.

42:30.580 --> 42:32.660
Yes, well, excellent.

42:32.660 --> 42:33.220
Thank you.

42:33.220 --> 42:41.220
I want to tell you about some new Halloween offerings, if it is a spooky time of year,

42:41.220 --> 42:42.020
of course.

42:42.020 --> 42:51.780
Some Halloween offerings from local donut chains there in your United States of America.

42:51.780 --> 42:52.100
Okay.

42:52.660 --> 42:53.940
All right, let him rip.

42:54.820 --> 43:02.820
May I adopt the typical cadence of a classic American as I read these?

43:02.820 --> 43:06.660
Or else this episode's going to be 87 minutes long.

43:06.660 --> 43:08.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:08.340 --> 43:10.340
I do not consent to that.

43:10.340 --> 43:14.500
We can't have fucking eight minutes of Dracula preamble, and then when it comes time for

43:14.500 --> 43:17.620
the fucking pearl inside the oyster, it switches back to Justin.

43:17.620 --> 43:18.660
Absolutely not, you made this bad.

43:18.660 --> 43:19.620
Here's what we'll do.

43:19.620 --> 43:20.020
Hypnotize-

43:20.020 --> 43:21.620
It won't be Justin, he's dead.

43:21.620 --> 43:28.020
Yeah, hypnotize Griffin so he still hears Dracula, and then you can speak in an American

43:28.020 --> 43:28.660
cadence.

43:28.660 --> 43:30.980
No, no, he has spoken.

43:30.980 --> 43:32.740
He has used his will.

43:32.740 --> 43:33.780
I'm going to go get some water.

43:33.780 --> 43:37.460
Perhaps for the last time.

43:37.460 --> 43:38.820
Are you going to kill Griffin?

43:38.820 --> 43:40.980
Nuggets are on notice.

43:40.980 --> 43:43.380
Sandwiches be warned and move over.

43:43.380 --> 43:43.940
Tacos.

43:44.740 --> 43:51.620
A donut is now heating up the battle for spicy superiority, proving that the number one brand

43:51.620 --> 43:55.620
in donuts can rock a spicy side.

43:55.620 --> 44:01.220
Can rock a spicy side?

44:01.220 --> 44:05.540
I will have silence, or I will have your head.

44:06.660 --> 44:13.780
Duncan has made up one of the most surprising treats ever to rise from its kitchens.

44:13.780 --> 44:16.820
The new spicy ghost pepper donut.

44:16.820 --> 44:17.540
Fuck off.

44:17.540 --> 44:24.900
A deliciously daring donut that delivers the heat with every bite.

44:24.900 --> 44:35.540
This spicy ghost pepper donut is a classic yeast donut topped with a strawberry flavored

44:35.540 --> 44:38.340
icing that you could easily mistake for...

44:38.340 --> 44:40.900
Wink-a-wink-a.

44:40.900 --> 44:41.460
Blub.

44:41.460 --> 44:47.380
And a bold blend of cayenne and ghost pepper.

44:47.380 --> 44:48.820
Ghost pepper.

44:51.060 --> 44:55.380
And finished with red sanding sugar for a sizzling look.

44:56.260 --> 45:01.620
The spicy ghost pepper donut will be on the menu for only a few hot minutes.

45:02.420 --> 45:09.940
Available beginning today for a limited time at participating Duncan restaurants nationwide

45:09.940 --> 45:11.380
until December.

45:13.460 --> 45:18.260
I know this sort of solid baked treats are not really your jam count donut, but

45:19.780 --> 45:21.700
you think you'd want to tear one of those bad boys down?

45:24.980 --> 45:26.820
I do not believe so.

45:26.820 --> 45:28.980
Because it sounds gross?

45:28.980 --> 45:29.700
Because it sounds yucky?

45:29.700 --> 45:33.060
No, but I have my guts.

45:34.500 --> 45:39.060
My guts inside no longer have the...

45:39.060 --> 45:42.260
I, yes, internal blood syndrome.

45:42.820 --> 45:45.860
I only can consume and digest blood.

45:46.420 --> 45:48.660
Okay, so you're not immune to all diseases then?

45:50.100 --> 45:54.100
It's not a disease to eat something that disagrees with you.

45:54.100 --> 45:55.540
Well, tell that to Griffin.

45:55.540 --> 46:03.780
If you put mayonnaise into your car's fuel intake and it exploded,

46:03.780 --> 46:07.780
you wouldn't go to the doctor and say my car is terribly sick.

46:07.780 --> 46:11.220
Why would I go to the doctor for my car?

46:11.220 --> 46:12.020
And I might.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.340
Don't you assume that about me?

46:14.340 --> 46:15.220
I might do that.

46:15.220 --> 46:16.340
Well, okay.

46:16.340 --> 46:17.700
Sorry, I'm sorry.

46:19.060 --> 46:22.740
If I ate tinfoil and started to cough blood,

46:22.740 --> 46:24.340
you wouldn't say get away from me.

46:24.340 --> 46:25.540
I don't want to catch it.

46:26.100 --> 46:26.900
I'm not sick.

46:26.900 --> 46:29.940
I would say that there was something wrong with you.

46:30.820 --> 46:34.660
Halloween looks a little different this year and so do our donuts.

46:34.660 --> 46:40.420
While our classic bakery offering has plenty of crave-worthy treats,

46:41.220 --> 46:46.500
we're excited to show our spicy side with a donut that packs a touch of heat

46:47.140 --> 46:52.020
with something sweet and can be enjoyed any time of day.

46:52.020 --> 46:55.140
The fucking cowardice in that quote where they had to say,

46:55.140 --> 47:00.260
don't worry, we still have our normal, not disgusting donuts.

47:00.260 --> 47:03.140
Not spicy items available still.

47:03.140 --> 47:07.140
With our scary good lineup of the spicy ghost pepper donut,

47:07.140 --> 47:11.060
Halloween DIY Dunkin' Donut decorating kits,

47:11.060 --> 47:14.420
and the fan favorite spider donut,

47:15.220 --> 47:20.260
Dunkin' is here to help our guests keep their Halloween spirit alive.

47:20.260 --> 47:23.540
Yes, if you're wondering if the opening line,

47:23.540 --> 47:26.420
Halloween looks a little different this year,

47:26.420 --> 47:30.980
is a reference to COVID-19 in this press release

47:30.980 --> 47:33.780
about new donut kinds.

47:34.420 --> 47:35.940
Yes, that is correct.

47:35.940 --> 47:38.260
It is wholly inescapable.

47:38.980 --> 47:43.380
Now hop on my back as I whisk you away to Duck Donuts.

47:43.380 --> 47:43.880
Whee!

47:45.060 --> 47:46.260
Where the fuck are we going?

47:46.260 --> 47:48.260
What's Duck Donuts?

47:48.260 --> 47:50.580
There's 97 of them.

47:50.580 --> 47:52.820
It's from the people who brought you Duck Dynasty.

47:53.380 --> 47:53.940
All right.

47:53.940 --> 47:58.660
I don't know if that is accurate, but I do know this is accurate.

47:58.660 --> 48:00.340
They've got the Spooky Box.

48:00.340 --> 48:00.900
Excuse me?

48:04.340 --> 48:09.940
The popular Spooky Box is all about the treats with 12 wonderful,

48:09.940 --> 48:13.380
colorfully unique flavor and topping combinations

48:13.380 --> 48:16.820
that are as photogenic as they are scrumptious.

48:16.820 --> 48:17.540
In a box.

48:18.180 --> 48:19.380
In the Spooky Box.

48:19.380 --> 48:27.780
In the Spooky Box, it's also the only chance this year

48:27.780 --> 48:31.300
to try the three limited time flavors,

48:31.300 --> 48:35.620
pumpkin icing, apple, and streusel topping.

48:36.340 --> 48:37.860
Not the spookiest.

48:38.820 --> 48:41.380
I mean, at least the Spooky Box is different.

48:41.380 --> 48:42.900
The Spooky Box is different.

48:43.700 --> 48:46.740
The Spooky Box features werewolf,

48:46.740 --> 48:50.580
which is maple biking with raspberry drizzle.

48:50.580 --> 48:51.620
How is that wolf?

48:51.620 --> 48:52.980
Durden worms.

48:53.700 --> 48:57.060
Chocolate icing with Oreo cookie pieces and gummy worms.

48:58.100 --> 48:59.140
Blueberry.

49:00.180 --> 49:01.300
TM, TM, TM.

49:01.300 --> 49:02.660
TM, TM.

49:02.660 --> 49:06.420
Blueberry icing with powdered sugar and spider web,

49:06.980 --> 49:09.940
which is cinnamon sugar with a vanilla drizzle.

49:10.580 --> 49:13.460
Ross DiGiulio, founder and CEO of Duck Donuts.

49:13.460 --> 49:14.900
I thought that was another flavor.

49:14.900 --> 49:22.340
And also we have, back by popular demand, Ross DiGiulio.

49:22.340 --> 49:26.020
We have found and crowned up another Ross DiGiulio.

49:26.660 --> 49:30.420
If you or someone you know is a Ross DiGiulio,

49:30.420 --> 49:34.820
please do the right moral thing and submit your body to us

49:34.820 --> 49:36.900
so that all may enjoy.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.820
The sixth flavor.

49:40.820 --> 49:43.460
Maybe just a few nails.

49:43.460 --> 49:48.020
Your hair clippings, Ross, please, we crave you.

49:49.220 --> 49:53.460
The most craveable Ross DiGiulio of the year is back.

49:53.460 --> 49:54.500
No, here he says,

49:55.140 --> 50:00.500
our Spooky Box is a joyful and giftable collection of delicious fun.

50:01.780 --> 50:02.420
That's right.

50:02.420 --> 50:03.060
Giftable.

50:03.060 --> 50:05.060
If you give it away, you will not be arrested.

50:06.500 --> 50:09.220
It's served warm and ready for sharing.

50:10.260 --> 50:12.900
We all need something to look forward to right now.

50:12.900 --> 50:14.740
So yes, that's right.

50:14.740 --> 50:19.300
Our second reference to the COVID-19 crisis

50:19.300 --> 50:22.020
in an announcement about Halloween donuts.

50:22.980 --> 50:28.580
Thank you so much for reminding me about the ongoing pandemic.

50:28.580 --> 50:30.340
So appreciated.

50:30.340 --> 50:35.060
And thank God it's all fixed now because of your delicious Spooky Box.

50:35.060 --> 50:38.420
The Spooky Box really balances the whole thing out, doesn't it?

50:38.420 --> 50:39.060
Yeah.

50:39.060 --> 50:41.620
We all need something to look forward to right now.

50:41.620 --> 50:45.220
And the fun of Halloween can come soon enough.

50:46.260 --> 50:50.260
Bon appetit, boos and ghouls.

50:50.260 --> 50:52.260
Wow, fuck yeah.

50:52.260 --> 50:54.740
Do you think Russ said that out loud with his human mouth?

50:54.740 --> 50:56.980
Or do you think that's just something he said like,

50:56.980 --> 50:59.860
and then at the end you can write like, bon appetit.

50:59.860 --> 51:03.940
Russ, Russ, he did a terrible pun

51:03.940 --> 51:08.100
and reinforced the imaginary gender binary.

51:08.100 --> 51:12.820
What?

51:12.820 --> 51:17.220
Now I really trusted you, I have decided.

51:17.860 --> 51:22.100
Oh man, man, Count Donut, I doubted your skills

51:22.100 --> 51:24.900
when you first showed up, didn't know what your name was.

51:25.460 --> 51:28.020
But I gotta say you knocked it out of the park with these.

51:28.020 --> 51:29.380
Thank you so much.

51:29.380 --> 51:30.660
So what's next?

51:30.660 --> 51:33.380
Well, can you reanimate Justin's dead ass?

51:33.380 --> 51:34.020
He's dead.

51:35.220 --> 51:36.740
Can you emulate Justin?

51:36.740 --> 51:38.420
I'm sorry?

51:38.420 --> 51:40.500
Emulate him, like you beat him?

51:40.500 --> 51:42.260
Oh, sure, sure, of course.

51:42.820 --> 51:44.980
A woodworking Disney world.

51:46.660 --> 51:48.820
Good one, Count Donut.

51:48.820 --> 51:50.580
No dice, no.

51:50.580 --> 51:52.180
I love sleep no more.

51:52.180 --> 51:53.540
Sorry, I can't.

51:53.540 --> 51:55.140
Oh man, Justin has a family.

51:55.140 --> 51:56.420
I mean us, but.

51:56.420 --> 51:58.500
Try saying something about FMV games.

51:58.500 --> 51:58.820
Yeah.

51:58.820 --> 51:59.940
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

52:00.500 --> 52:03.620
Sewer shark, it's fun game, good time.

52:03.620 --> 52:06.420
Cereal, maybe cereals or anything to do with that?

52:06.420 --> 52:10.020
Oh, I love to crunch with a relaxing bowl of it.

52:10.900 --> 52:12.020
That was actually pretty good.

52:12.020 --> 52:14.980
You sound like a mix between Gilbert Gottfried and Olaf.

52:15.700 --> 52:17.540
Is that what you were going for?

52:18.260 --> 52:19.860
I have not seen, I do not know if he's Olaf.

52:19.860 --> 52:21.380
Oh, you haven't seen Frozen?

52:22.340 --> 52:25.460
No, I've seen Frozen and I don't know Gilbert Gottfried.

52:25.460 --> 52:26.340
Oh, of course.

52:26.340 --> 52:27.300
You haven't seen Aladdin?

52:28.340 --> 52:30.980
I have seen Aladdin live action.

52:30.980 --> 52:32.740
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:32.740 --> 52:33.940
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

52:33.940 --> 52:36.580
Can you say something about A Big Beautiful Buick Enclave?

52:36.580 --> 52:37.540
Justin loves them.

52:38.180 --> 52:40.900
A Big Beautiful Buick Enclave.

52:40.900 --> 52:41.700
Oh, God.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.300
That sounded great.

52:43.300 --> 52:44.180
Thank you.

52:44.180 --> 52:44.660
All right.

52:44.660 --> 52:45.620
See, it's better.

52:46.420 --> 52:47.940
It is an improvement.

52:47.940 --> 52:50.260
No, yeah, everything you're doing today is better.

52:50.260 --> 52:54.820
How about, why don't you Count Donut take us into our housekeeping?

52:55.940 --> 53:02.820
Of course, although I have help with that around the castle.

53:02.820 --> 53:03.940
Yes, of course.

53:03.940 --> 53:05.140
Yes, of course.

53:05.140 --> 53:09.460
I could have Renfield do the housekeeping for you if you would like.

53:09.460 --> 53:10.420
Oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

53:10.420 --> 53:12.420
Doesn't he sound more like Justin?

53:14.900 --> 53:15.540
That's a pass.

53:15.540 --> 53:16.020
That's a hard pass.

53:16.020 --> 53:20.020
My brother, my brother and me is an advice.

53:20.020 --> 53:28.740
Oh, and we so appreciate you listening to the master and these two other cattle.

53:28.740 --> 53:32.820
Wow, hey, Renfield, fuck you.

53:32.820 --> 53:35.860
Yeah, well, I'll get the cows back, of course.

53:37.700 --> 53:38.340
I'm so sorry.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.460
That dude sucks.

53:40.100 --> 53:40.660
I agree.

53:41.860 --> 53:44.740
I told him not to refer to you as cattle to your face.

53:44.740 --> 53:46.740
I want you to kill him.

53:46.740 --> 53:49.700
No, hold on, hold on.

53:49.700 --> 53:51.380
He's dead.

53:51.380 --> 53:58.180
I've put him on top of Justin's body in a way that would make Joey very uncomfortable.

53:58.180 --> 54:00.020
I get it, that's very funny.

54:00.020 --> 54:00.580
Thank you.

54:00.580 --> 54:06.820
Hey, Count, there's a podcast my wife and I are doing called Bake On where we talk about

54:06.820 --> 54:08.900
the new season of Great British Bake Off.

54:10.100 --> 54:11.780
We got three episodes out now.

54:11.780 --> 54:14.500
It's on your Podcatcher as well as on our YouTube channel.

54:14.500 --> 54:16.340
Do you think you'd want to check that out?

54:16.340 --> 54:17.620
I would love to.

54:17.620 --> 54:21.220
I'm more of a fan of video games, though.

54:21.220 --> 54:25.540
And I love to listen to Justin's podcast, The Best Things on Spotify.

54:25.540 --> 54:28.740
You should have thought about that before you did kill him.

54:28.740 --> 54:29.620
It's better now.

54:30.180 --> 54:36.020
Now I get to enjoy at least 25% more Russ Frushtick.

54:36.020 --> 54:36.740
At least.

54:36.740 --> 54:40.900
It's Griffin, it's Russ, and it's Chris Plant talking about video games.

54:40.900 --> 54:44.100
It used to be Justin in there too, but of course now he is drained.

54:44.100 --> 54:44.740
Dead.

54:44.740 --> 54:45.940
Yeah, of course.

54:46.820 --> 54:48.340
It's on Spotify.

54:48.340 --> 54:49.460
It's very good, I love it.

54:49.460 --> 54:52.020
Count Donut, do you mind if I talk about all of the merch?

54:52.020 --> 54:54.180
Because the thought of you, there's a lot.

54:54.180 --> 54:58.100
And the thought of you taking the sort of time you would need to talk about all of it

54:59.540 --> 55:01.060
scares me a lot.

55:01.060 --> 55:04.260
Can you, can I at least talk about the jump scare pin?

55:04.260 --> 55:05.300
Yeah, that's appropriate.

55:06.180 --> 55:14.180
There is a pin of Justin doing offensive fang face of me, Count Donutula.

55:14.180 --> 55:16.260
I regret allowing you to do that.

55:16.260 --> 55:23.300
The jump scare pin, and you can purchase it if you want to reinforce some truly harmful

55:23.300 --> 55:25.380
stereotypes about my kind.

55:25.380 --> 55:31.700
There's so much stuff at the McElroy merch site, which is McElroymerch.com.

55:32.660 --> 55:35.620
There is, God I wish Justin was alive to talk about the horseshoe crab shirt.

55:36.820 --> 55:44.260
Yes, his medical podcast with his wife, sorry, Vito Sidney,

55:44.260 --> 55:50.500
right, celebrating horseshoe crabs and their incredible contribution to vaccines.

55:52.100 --> 55:54.500
Yeah, did you know about this?

55:54.500 --> 55:55.940
No, I didn't know about that.

55:57.220 --> 56:03.540
You can test for impurities in vaccines if you are using the blood,

56:03.540 --> 56:05.540
dried blood of a horseshoe crab.

56:05.540 --> 56:08.180
That's exciting news, I'll make sure to do that.

56:08.180 --> 56:11.540
It coagulates, so sorry, I'm getting hungry now, listen to me.

56:11.540 --> 56:13.940
You feed on horseshoe crab blood?

56:13.940 --> 56:15.540
Just blood in general.

56:16.260 --> 56:21.220
There's also a tiger on the table pin of the month, which was designed by Sam Schultz,

56:21.220 --> 56:26.340
and sales of that benefit the Marsha P. Johnson Institute and the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.

56:27.300 --> 56:31.860
There is Candlenights ornaments designed by Lynn Doyle.

56:31.860 --> 56:34.420
There is Candlenights wrapping paper designed by Justin Gray.

56:35.140 --> 56:40.420
There's a thanks for vibing and keeping it tight shirt, which I still need to get one of,

56:40.420 --> 56:43.860
because they're one of my favorite pieces of merch we've ever put up on the store.

56:43.860 --> 56:48.660
And a portion of the proceeds for the shirt will go to the Young Center for Immigrant Children's

56:48.660 --> 56:55.060
Rights. And yeah, that's all at McRoyMerch.com. There's a lot of stuff.

56:55.060 --> 57:00.100
Okay, a couple quick things. We're doing a live stream of the game Among Us on Tuesday,

57:00.100 --> 57:03.780
the 20th at 9pm Eastern Time. It's going to be on our McRoy Family channel.

57:03.780 --> 57:08.740
It's me and the brothers and probably other family members, so make sure you check that out.

57:08.740 --> 57:13.540
Like we said earlier, we wrote a podcast how-to book called Everybody Has a Podcast Except You.

57:13.540 --> 57:17.460
It's available for pre-order now. It'll give you a step-by-step guide to make a show that

57:17.460 --> 57:23.300
you're proud of. You can pre-order that at themacroypodcastbook.com. It comes out January 26th.

57:23.300 --> 57:28.740
Also, Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom, which is the fourth graphic novel in the series,

57:28.740 --> 57:34.340
is available for pre-order. Just go to theadventurezonecomic.com. That comes out July 13th,

57:34.340 --> 57:39.300
2021. I think that's it. Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these theme songs that

57:39.300 --> 57:43.300
departure off the album putting the days to bed. Thanks to Maximum Fun. And thank you to Count

57:43.300 --> 57:49.220
Donut again for- Of course, it was my honor. I'm sorry about your brother. It was time.

57:49.220 --> 57:53.860
Although it seemed like more of a business relationship at this point. That's fine.

57:53.860 --> 57:57.940
We both have a spare still. Yeah, and you're doing better than he did really,

57:57.940 --> 58:00.020
so it might be an improvement. Thank you.

58:00.020 --> 58:05.540
Here's another Yahoo sent in by Merritt Palmer, the prospector. Thank you, Merritt.

58:05.540 --> 58:10.020
What happened? Oh, man, he's not dead. There's this guy on top of me.

58:10.020 --> 58:13.700
Oh, that's Count Donut. He's like Dracula, but for donuts.

58:13.700 --> 58:17.060
And the guy on top of you is a dead Renfield. Well, I guess

58:18.660 --> 58:23.700
Justin's alive, so you don't need to tweet at him about this segment.

58:23.700 --> 58:30.660
All right. Or condolences to his wife that without context will seem extremely disturbing.

58:30.660 --> 58:33.700
But if you do have anything, you can just tweet at Count Donut.

58:34.580 --> 58:43.220
Yeah, that's going to be somebody that we have no quality control on. Big ups to Trav.

58:44.180 --> 58:48.020
Anyway, Merritt sent this in. Thanks, Merritt. It's Yahoo Answers user Ramiro who asks.

58:48.020 --> 58:50.580
And I'm going to read the question and the additional details because it's important.

58:50.580 --> 58:56.020
John Travolta dancing in Pulp Fiction. How well did he do on a scale of one to five?

58:56.020 --> 59:00.500
I give him a four. He seems like he gave it a good effort and had a fun time,

59:00.500 --> 59:02.420
but maybe you feel otherwise.

59:06.420 --> 59:08.820
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

59:08.820 --> 59:11.860
I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm fucking five. Oh, my God.

59:11.860 --> 59:12.980
Oh, really? I want to say this.

59:12.980 --> 59:22.580
Really? I want to say this. Kiss your dad's grown lips.
