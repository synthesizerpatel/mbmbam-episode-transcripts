00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.920 --> 00:52.960
Hello, I'm John Williams, and welcome to the Olympics.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.040
Recognize that one? That's the little tune I came up with called the Olympics.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.880
That's the John Williams joint.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.640
We're coming to you guys, coming to you guys live from Sochi, and oh my,

01:05.360 --> 01:09.520
oh the sidewalk outside my hotel has cracks in it.

01:09.520 --> 01:14.720
Oh my, it's so cold here in Russia because I didn't know it'd be cold in the winter.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.400
I'm so fucking over it.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.920
I'm- you get to travel to all these exquisite places.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.120
Exquisite, I meant to say exotic, but it's an exquisite place too.

01:27.920 --> 01:28.560
I just don't-

01:28.560 --> 01:31.280
There is nothing going wrong in Russia right now.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.840
You are lucky to be there.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.960
This podcast, by the way, is brought to you by the Russian Olympic Committee.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.840
Go check it out. It's great. Everyone's welcome.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.840
The best Olympics since ever.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.200
Since ever, basically.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.800
You're welcome, the world.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.240
Sincerely, Russia.

01:46.960 --> 01:54.720
Russia has a lot of great features that I think journalists are missing

01:54.720 --> 01:57.040
when they're complaining about hotel rooms and-

01:58.400 --> 01:59.680
Here's what they're missing out.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.600
Lots of affordable real estate.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.680
Oh man, you just- you know what?

02:03.680 --> 02:08.160
My- our new- I've been working with the Tourism Committee.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.720
Our new slogan is room to stretch out.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.920
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.840
Room to create your own smaller country inside our country.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.760
And no one else will live.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.440
No, no one would know for years.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.040
That's how Japan got started.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.840
I don't know, guys.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.560
Obviously, Russia's done some pretty shady shit.

02:26.560 --> 02:31.520
Putin, I guess I'm not a huge fan of Putin, all things told.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.280
Oh, I get it, Travis.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.080
I don't like to-

02:36.080 --> 02:37.200
Yeah, god damn it.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.120
I'm trying to fucking elevate the level of discourse in this show.

02:41.120 --> 02:46.240
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.720
I just feel like in the opening ceremony,

02:48.720 --> 02:50.160
there was like this big elaborate thing

02:50.160 --> 02:51.440
where they had these five snowflakes

02:51.440 --> 02:53.440
and then they expanded to make the five Olympic rings.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.520
Only one of them didn't deploy and everyone was like,

02:55.520 --> 02:56.960
nice try, Russia.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.120
Like guys, it's a- it was a- it was one fucking thing.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.920
Can you cut them a little bit of slack?

03:03.920 --> 03:06.160
Like shit's not great there.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.280
Yeah, they don't have like-

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Do you know that to make this-

03:10.000 --> 03:12.960
Do you know how many people they've had to exploit?

03:13.680 --> 03:16.800
How many of their humans that they've had to grind down

03:16.800 --> 03:18.240
into the doorknob metal?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.680
Those are people, okay?

03:19.680 --> 03:20.480
Those are people.

03:20.480 --> 03:24.080
They take fillings from old women and they pop them out

03:24.080 --> 03:26.320
and they turn them into gold-plated doorknobs

03:26.320 --> 03:27.920
for you sons of bitches.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.200
And you're complaining because the water isn't perfectly clear?

03:31.200 --> 03:33.600
Oh, sus, I'm sorry.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.440
I'm an old Russian grandma.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.600
Here, take the rest of my teeth.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.720
My gold teeth.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.920
They juiced the citizens to fill- to ice the luge.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.000
They needed luge lube and so they just-

03:48.640 --> 03:50.240
You're saying blood.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.520
They reduced their citizens in a hot pan.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.240
Nobody that can believe Jamaica-

03:56.240 --> 03:57.360
Ah, I hit some gristle.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.040
Pool runnings.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.720
Pool runnings two.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.360
The bone slide.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.080
You know they're back.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.760
I know they are.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.720
Well, I mean, not the actors who play-

04:08.720 --> 04:09.840
Not Dougie Doug.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.040
Wait, how can they race again when the sled broke at the end?

04:13.680 --> 04:14.880
Well, they didn't die, Travis.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.080
They can buy new fucking sleds.

04:16.080 --> 04:16.800
That was the whole thing.

04:16.800 --> 04:17.440
They didn't die.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.360
They got up and they carried their shit.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.840
Oh, I just turned it off as soon as the sled broke and I went-

04:21.840 --> 04:22.560
Yeah, I get it.

04:22.560 --> 04:22.960
I get it.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.000
You saw the one rail start to wobble and you're like,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.040
oh, these guys are dead.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.320
Close, exit, stop, eject the DVD.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.320
I don't have time for losers.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.480
I'm so excited we got Olympic fever.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.440
We can't wait for the games to start in earnest.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.120
I enjoyed the-

04:41.360 --> 04:46.080
I enjoyed last night's opening ceremonies because they featured Tattoo.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.960
Tattoo, apparently, and this is-

04:50.960 --> 04:52.560
I'm not joking about this.

04:52.560 --> 05:02.480
Tattoo is apparently the only recognizable Russian musical export of the modern era, basically.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.440
That cannot possibly be right.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.760
Russia has had one hit and it's Tattoo.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.320
That can't possibly be right.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.760
There's no way that that is true.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.320
Quickly name me your other favorite Russian cultural export and wait.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.440
Yakov Smirnoff.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.720
Yakov Smirnoff doesn't count.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.040
Sum 41.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.240
Blink 182.

05:22.240 --> 05:22.560
Lit.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.400
The band Lit.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.320
Lit, the band.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.240
Who are those dudes-

05:29.440 --> 05:30.080
Eve 6.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.760
He schools you on that one, Justin.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.760
That entire genre was birthed in the motherland.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.240
I see.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.560
That wall fell.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.440
Boom.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.440
It was like bubblegum punk.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.720
Wallflowers.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.760
Goo Goo Dolls.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.680
I don't think any of this is accurate.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.040
Matchbox 20.

05:53.040 --> 05:53.600
Matchbox-

05:55.680 --> 05:56.320
Yes.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.680
Yes, Matchbox 20.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.240
I'll count it.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.760
I have a problem when I go out to eat with other people.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.120
Once our food comes out, I always eat it too fast.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.320
I don't think I'm wolfing down my food, but I'm consistently finished 10 minutes

06:11.440 --> 06:13.680
before anyone else in my group.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.360
It doesn't seem to bother my girlfriend.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.520
We always make jokes when we're out and notice it.

06:17.520 --> 06:23.360
However, when I'm out with less intimate friends, particularly professional business contacts,

06:23.360 --> 06:26.560
I feel rude finishing well ahead of them.

06:26.560 --> 06:26.960
Should I?

06:27.680 --> 06:32.880
Am I unwittingly putting my dining partners on a kind of mild blast by eating faster than them?

06:33.520 --> 06:37.680
If so, how can I slow my roll at restaurants and match the pace of my group?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.680
That's from Fast Finisher and Fairfax.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.800
Guys, we've been doing this for a long time.

06:42.800 --> 06:50.000
You gotta throw us some harder questions that cannot be answered with eat slower.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.200
Like, we're professionals here.

06:54.960 --> 06:59.200
You could answer this question with two, maybe two and a half brothers.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.320
But let me throw this out because I'm also a fast eater.

07:04.880 --> 07:05.920
The problem is-

07:05.920 --> 07:09.040
I might suggest the fastest eater.

07:09.040 --> 07:13.280
Well, I have been described as looking like I'm afraid someone's gonna take my food bowl away.

07:15.120 --> 07:19.360
But the problem is that sometimes you're going and you think you're pacing yourself.

07:19.360 --> 07:24.080
You think you're going slow and you look up and like they haven't even started.

07:24.080 --> 07:24.400
Yeah.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.680
And you're like, God damn it.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.280
So what I do is I wait 10 minutes, let everyone else start eating,

07:29.280 --> 07:31.200
and then I make a face just so you can catch up.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.360
You give them a head start in fairness's sake.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.760
All right, I'm gonna spot you fools 10 minutes.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.240
You guys go ahead. No, no, no, it's fine.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.200
I'll catch up.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.280
Yeah, the freight trains are coming.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.640
You know, it might be fun.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.480
Fun little exercise whenever you're out.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.040
And this would be really great for like a business associate

07:49.040 --> 07:54.160
would be to mirror them perfectly while you're eating.

07:54.160 --> 07:57.680
So every time they take a bite, you take an equally sized bite

07:57.680 --> 08:01.440
at literally the exact same time to the same exact amount of choose

08:01.440 --> 08:03.760
and just keep your eyes fucking locked on them.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.520
Just keep it locked.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.440
It'll be like one of those theater exercises.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.360
Like when you're mirroring each other.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.880
Or what you can do is you get like a big plastic ball

08:12.880 --> 08:15.440
and you put it on your plate and you have to push it around

08:16.160 --> 08:17.840
to get to the food so you don't eat so fast.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.400
That's what you do with dogs who gulp their food down.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.080
I think it works for human beings too.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.880
In a professional setting, you're at a big business eating it.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.400
A plastic ball in your food.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.440
Yeah, you gotta push it around to get to it so you can't eat it too fast.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.880
It makes it more of a challenge.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.520
You know, for some people eating has become too easy

08:35.520 --> 08:37.360
and it's just easy to just like fly through it.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.280
So you need to just provide some challenge.

08:39.280 --> 08:43.360
What if you just dump like a sickening amount of salt on your food

08:43.920 --> 08:46.720
to where every bite is like a painful trial.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.120
It's like a Sisyphean task just to choke it down.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.720
Would that help?

08:50.720 --> 08:52.240
Or order something you hate.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.960
Like if you actively know you hate pasta, just like,

08:54.960 --> 08:56.240
I'll take the pasta dish.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.360
Your girlfriend's like, what?

08:57.360 --> 08:58.720
But you don't like, honey, I know.

08:58.720 --> 09:03.600
Of all the foods, Travis, who hates pasta?

09:03.600 --> 09:04.560
I do.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.720
Pasta is such a, it's like saying I hate bread.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.080
Like there's all kinds of different bread.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.440
I do hate spaghetti.

09:11.440 --> 09:14.160
I mean, I don't actively hate spaghetti, but it's not my favorite.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.080
Did you barf it up once?

09:16.080 --> 09:17.120
I ate it several times.

09:17.760 --> 09:18.560
I remember that.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.560
I remember that night at the lake house cabin.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.760
That was a bad night.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.320
It's just such a cheap food in college that you're like,

09:24.320 --> 09:26.480
we're gonna eat some spaghetti and then party.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.520
And it can go out wrong holes.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.840
It actually prefers to go out wrong holes.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.640
Give me two of your deer nuts.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.200
Shooting spaghetti out your deers.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.520
Like one of those Play-Doh hair maker things,

09:41.520 --> 09:43.520
and it just pushes out your hair.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.760
He partied so hard, he noodle cried.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.600
It was brutal, man.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.760
Can you just order more food?

09:50.480 --> 09:52.160
Get two dinners, that's what I do.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.040
Get two dinners, okay, hold on, sorry.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.880
Scratch that, strike it from the record,

09:56.880 --> 09:59.120
because if it's something Travis does vis-a-vis

09:59.120 --> 10:01.840
the consumption of food, then maybe-

10:01.840 --> 10:03.920
I can't decide between the steak dish and the chicken dish?

10:03.920 --> 10:06.800
Do not worry, my friend, I've got a solution for you.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.080
Is yes an option?

10:08.960 --> 10:09.920
How about this?

10:09.920 --> 10:12.480
Get work-intensive food, like crab claws.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.320
How about that?

10:14.320 --> 10:15.840
That'll take you a while to get through.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.880
Let me throw this out, though.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.240
If you're trying to be a professional

10:18.240 --> 10:19.680
in a professional setting,

10:19.680 --> 10:21.200
and you can't control yourself enough

10:21.200 --> 10:22.720
to slow down your eating,

10:22.720 --> 10:25.280
maybe something that you have to suck and chew on

10:25.280 --> 10:29.440
is not the most attractive poison to get.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.800
Well, you don't, I mean, how is your crab cracking game

10:32.800 --> 10:35.920
if you're just going at it like a fucking feared wolf?

10:35.920 --> 10:40.560
Our dad Clint McElroy, you may know him from the radio,

10:41.520 --> 10:44.960
he would, when we were on vacation

10:44.960 --> 10:46.800
in any sort of coastal region,

10:47.600 --> 10:49.840
he would always look forward to the night

10:49.840 --> 10:52.160
where he would eat at an all-you-can-eat crab place.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.560
And the all-you-can-eat crab place

10:54.560 --> 10:56.240
would not look forward to-

10:56.240 --> 10:58.240
He would not add his picture up.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.760
And we would literally finish our dinners

11:01.760 --> 11:06.640
and then go shopping and come back for that later.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.960
Good ketchup for the winter months.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.960
But I think the terrible truth about it

11:10.960 --> 11:14.320
is that with eating crab claws,

11:14.320 --> 11:17.600
you are literally expending as much energy

11:19.520 --> 11:23.120
to open them as you're being provided by your body.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.320
It's just an endless cycle.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.840
There's no getting full

11:25.840 --> 11:28.320
because you're just burning it as it comes in.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.400
Unless you do it in the Clint McElroy,

11:30.400 --> 11:35.120
he was very chimpanzee-esque in his ways.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.400
He would stick twigs and sticks in.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.320
No, he would just jam a finger

11:40.320 --> 11:43.040
into the belly of its tummy chitin'

11:43.040 --> 11:45.360
and then just put his mouth on that hole

11:45.360 --> 11:48.880
and then just all of the meat from inside the crab

11:48.880 --> 11:51.120
would just shoot into his gullet.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.520
He has a very particular set of skills.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.800
You guys want Yahoo?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.200
Please.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.480
I mean, let's just start off with a horse question

12:02.480 --> 12:05.600
because it's like what people want.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.840
This is our wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.520
It's what people came to hear.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.840
This one was sent in by Joseph Hoglid.

12:11.840 --> 12:12.560
Thank you, Joseph.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gabby who asks,

12:15.280 --> 12:18.800
I need to steal a horse slash horse gear.

12:18.800 --> 12:24.080
I'm not looking for answers saying,

12:24.080 --> 12:26.320
oh, don't do it, it's the wrong thing to do.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.480
I just want ideas on how to do it.

12:28.480 --> 12:34.640
Okay, so the paddock, it is in half wire fencing

12:34.640 --> 12:37.200
and the stable which has tack in it

12:37.200 --> 12:39.360
is right next to the stable.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.080
Wow, Jesus.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.240
This is, of course, from the rear of their property.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.320
Okay, so how do I tell if they're home,

12:46.320 --> 12:47.280
like in their house?

12:47.280 --> 12:48.800
What should I wear to steal?

12:49.520 --> 12:49.840
Thanks.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.560
This is easy.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.400
Have we done horse thievery before?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.000
I think we've talked about how difficult it is

12:56.000 --> 12:58.400
to steal a horse, but we've never devised

12:58.400 --> 13:00.160
a fucking Danny Ocean plan.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.840
I question one thing about this question.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.120
That is this person is in the market

13:07.120 --> 13:10.800
to steal a horse or horse gear.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.960
It seems like-

13:12.960 --> 13:14.800
I assumed it was an and.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.640
Oh, okay.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.440
All right.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.680
That's not like I either need a horse

13:19.680 --> 13:21.520
or just, I don't know, like a saddle

13:21.520 --> 13:23.840
I can put on a fence in my own imagination.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.680
I mean, as we covered in the last episode,

13:25.680 --> 13:27.520
the fucking recurring expenses,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.840
the upkeep of a goddamn horse

13:29.840 --> 13:31.440
will put you out of house and home.

13:31.440 --> 13:35.040
It would be much, much, much less expensive

13:35.040 --> 13:36.480
to just have a saddle

13:36.480 --> 13:38.240
because you don't have to feed that shit.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.080
You just like keep it in your room.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.560
Look at it.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.000
Sit on it, sit on a desk chair and make believe.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.360
I think all you need to steal a horse

13:47.360 --> 13:48.880
is a really big trench coat.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.080
And you put that on the horse?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.480
Well, I mean, I figured you'd-

13:52.480 --> 13:54.640
And then you put the trench coat on you.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.160
You're a centaur.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.840
You're just a centaur, basically.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.040
Oh, hello.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.720
Oh, you've caught me touring your grounds.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.160
I hope you don't mind.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.000
I'm looking for a summer home.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.880
I'm looking for a sweet Philly to call my mate.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.480
Please try to ignore the horse face

14:12.480 --> 14:14.240
coming out of my stomach.

14:14.240 --> 14:14.800
It's a birth defect.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.640
I'm having that removed later.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.160
I'm having it removed.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.840
You may be wondering what happens

14:19.840 --> 14:22.960
when a full-blown centaur makes love to a Philly.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.400
Well, I'll tell you.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.200
One quarter human, three quarters horse,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.440
and you'll never guess which quarter it gets.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.320
One quarter human, three quarters horse,

14:32.320 --> 14:34.480
and 100% plesior.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.440
The human butt is what a quarter centaur-

14:38.560 --> 14:39.360
Just the butt?

14:39.360 --> 14:40.720
It's a horse with a human butt.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.600
Right, it is a lot of stuff.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.800
That's a horse of a horrifyingly different color.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.800
Damn, horses love them apple bottom jeans.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.480
Stealing a horse slash horse gear.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.920
How do we tell if they're home?

14:53.920 --> 14:54.640
First you put-

14:54.640 --> 14:56.400
Well, how do you tell if the horse is home?

14:56.400 --> 14:57.840
They don't have a busy life.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.720
They're usually there.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.240
I guess he's either out jumping or-

15:02.240 --> 15:05.040
He's either jumping or looking for oats.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.800
He's got bowling on Wednesdays,

15:06.800 --> 15:09.440
but other than that, it's pretty wide open.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.320
Yeah, he's gonna join a football team with Tony Danza

15:12.320 --> 15:13.920
and lead the team to the-

15:13.920 --> 15:15.520
But that's not until the spring.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.240
Yeah, so you-

15:16.240 --> 15:18.960
That's not until like 1998.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.080
When did that movie come out?

15:22.080 --> 15:23.040
Horse punters.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.640
I conflated a few movies there.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.440
I conflated Horses with the movie

15:27.440 --> 15:29.600
where Tony Danza was a garbage man

15:29.600 --> 15:32.480
that kicked field goals for the Philadelphia Eagles.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.680
Let me show you how to kick a football, Tony Danza.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.600
Tony!

15:37.600 --> 15:40.320
God, if that movie had him being trained by a horse.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.720
Why is Tony Danza punting the ball

15:42.720 --> 15:44.800
with the back of his foot backwards?

15:44.800 --> 15:46.480
Why is Tony Danza on television?

15:47.520 --> 15:49.280
Why am I watching this movie?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.480
Oh, cause I'm super high.

15:52.320 --> 15:52.880
Thanks, Tony Danza.

15:52.880 --> 15:53.680
That's right.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.400
I remember now.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.200
Thanks, Tony D.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.520
If those dogs from Incredible Journey could get back,

15:59.520 --> 16:01.280
don't you think this horse is gonna escape

16:01.280 --> 16:07.360
at first opportunity and run back to their owners?

16:07.360 --> 16:09.280
That bond is unbreakable.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.760
You can't drive to a different geographical location.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.160
What I'm saying is that if you're gonna steal a horse

16:14.160 --> 16:17.440
from somebody, it better be glue day one.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.320
You better turn it into glue immediately.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.760
Otherwise it's gonna run back to its owner.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.840
Well, then why not just steal some glue?

16:25.760 --> 16:28.560
It seems significantly easier.

16:28.560 --> 16:28.960
It does.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.320
Yeah, you think that, but I mean,

16:30.320 --> 16:31.840
think about your ROI, Travis.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.680
You never think about your ROI.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.240
You would have to steal a shit ton of glue.

16:36.240 --> 16:36.720
Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of glue.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.640
And that glue is gonna be, you gotta think about-

16:38.640 --> 16:40.480
Well, you just need a big trench coat.

16:42.880 --> 16:43.600
Hey guys, listen.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.960
A friend of mine is having a baby shower

16:44.960 --> 16:47.600
to celebrate them adopting a teenager.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.320
Obviously the traditional diapers and onesies won't work,

16:50.320 --> 16:51.920
so I don't know what to get.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.120
What kind of present would you get

16:53.120 --> 16:54.800
for a baby shower for a teenage boy?

16:56.400 --> 16:57.440
That's from Gmail.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.560
Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.200
Next question.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.520
Kids love that shit, right?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.000
Why are you assuming he's not an adult teen baby?

17:04.000 --> 17:04.720
He might be.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.560
Oh, Christ.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.040
I had literally just gotten to a point in my life

17:09.040 --> 17:10.720
where I'd forgotten that terminology.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.200
Please find out, do me a favor.

17:14.240 --> 17:18.320
Maybe the thing with, okay, the thing with baby gifts

17:18.320 --> 17:21.440
is that the reason people like to do baby showers

17:21.440 --> 17:25.920
and people have them and can have them,

17:25.920 --> 17:27.680
like can literally have them,

17:27.680 --> 17:30.960
is that babies aren't people in the traditional sense

17:30.960 --> 17:33.120
in that you could just buy them anything

17:33.120 --> 17:35.120
that fits their body and you're like,

17:35.120 --> 17:37.840
hey, you like this now, baby, handle it.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.840
Handle this bib that has a dinosaur on it

17:39.840 --> 17:41.120
because now you like dinosaurs.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.480
I can make you like anything I want.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.480
Back when I was too young to protest,

17:44.480 --> 17:47.040
our parents put like sports balls

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
around the border of my room.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.640
Like they painted them on there, like sports balls.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.240
Maybe this will take purchase in our baby's dumb brain.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.320
It is, yeah, no dice, guys.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.640
It didn't, it doesn't work that way.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.400
Now that he's a 13-year-old boy,

18:02.400 --> 18:04.480
maybe you could just get him

18:04.480 --> 18:07.360
like the things you would give for a human.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.680
Maybe get him like a gift card.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.720
Like find out what he likes and then like-

18:12.720 --> 18:14.880
Okay, Justin, you're talking big game right now.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.400
What do teens like?

18:16.400 --> 18:17.760
This is a new fun game show

18:17.760 --> 18:19.040
that we play only on my brother and my brother.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.960
Do you know what they like?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.400
To be asked.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.080
Just ask them, that's what I'm saying.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.680
Just ask them like a person.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.960
Like what is this kid?

18:26.960 --> 18:28.000
Does he like video games?

18:28.000 --> 18:28.960
Does he like sports?

18:28.960 --> 18:30.160
Does he like to read?

18:30.160 --> 18:31.120
I have a good one.

18:31.120 --> 18:34.880
Why don't you get him a gift card to like-

18:34.880 --> 18:36.320
Auntie Anne's pretzels.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.240
Can you just let me finish a sentence?

18:38.240 --> 18:39.840
It's just that everyone likes pretzels.

18:39.840 --> 18:40.880
Just one sentence.

18:40.880 --> 18:41.280
I just want to finish.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.040
If they like the pretzel, maybe he's a big pretzel fan.

18:43.040 --> 18:43.680
Justin, I'm sorry.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.880
I know you were onto something good there,

18:44.880 --> 18:47.840
but I feel like Travis might be onto something better.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.680
Teens love pretzels.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.800
Teens love wrapped foods.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.320
They love them all camaraderie.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.880
It's a weird situation.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.280
You want to show this new teen out the gate

19:01.280 --> 19:03.360
that you are like fucking Keaton.

19:03.360 --> 19:07.600
You are cool Uncle Barry or Aunt Harriet.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.800
You want to just like get him a gift

19:10.800 --> 19:11.840
and show that you fucking just

19:11.840 --> 19:14.160
preternaturally know what teens like.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.840
Because hey, I was a teen once.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.800
I shot that Hot Topic.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.000
We were not teens like these teens were teens.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.880
We didn't have cell phones or internet.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.640
It has, there's no connection.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.080
My Flappy Bird was Jesus Christ.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.020
What?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.880
You know Flappy Bird?

19:33.760 --> 19:35.040
The game Flappy Bird?

19:35.040 --> 19:37.120
The energy that teens are putting into that,

19:37.120 --> 19:38.800
I put into Jesus Christ.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.120
At church camp and stuff.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.480
Maybe get my gift certificate to church camp.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.760
Or Flappy Bird.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.960
This is a real pickle you're in.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.240
I'm going to stick with you Geocards

19:48.240 --> 19:49.760
and let's just go on to another question.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.560
Okay, let me ask you guys.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.040
Yu-Gi-Oh cards is an investment.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.160
You know, it's like a fucking,

19:56.160 --> 19:57.680
you're buying that kid bonds.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.040
It's like a bond.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.520
You're basically buying him stocks and bonds.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.680
This is for your future.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.400
Don't look at it.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.040
I mean, do look at it.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.560
Cause I do need someone to play with.

20:09.120 --> 20:09.920
How about a Yahoo?

20:10.480 --> 20:11.520
Yeah, Yahoo would be great.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.880
This Yahoo was sent in by Kyle Foreman.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.360
Thank you, Kyle.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.920
It's by Yahoo answers user Bialo who asks,

20:17.920 --> 20:19.760
how to shave mustache.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.560
14 year old.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.080
I am beginning to notice that my mustache

20:24.080 --> 20:25.680
is starting to stand out more

20:25.680 --> 20:27.280
and I want to get rid of it.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.960
I have never done this in my life.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.480
So shaving would be new to me.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.280
I want my mustache completely gone.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.040
No mustache hairstyle, please.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.040
All right, here's my mustache status.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.080
Color, black, size, relatively small.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.280
Health, 100.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.480
Defense, 60G.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.680
Defense, 62 intelligence.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.280
What's your mustache's stamina?

20:51.840 --> 20:53.360
Yukio summon points, three.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.080
How do you shave?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.520
My mustache is low on mana.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.000
My brother has all these shaving cream and razor.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.280
I'm going to borrow his.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.840
Please list the steps and tips on how to shave.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.640
Like should I stroke up or down or side

21:08.640 --> 21:11.040
or wet the mustache or shave it dry?

21:11.040 --> 21:11.920
Whoa, buddy.

21:12.960 --> 21:13.760
Oh my God.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.320
All you need to know is do it with reckless abandon.

21:16.320 --> 21:21.200
Oh, guys, I am experiencing like a little bit

21:21.200 --> 21:23.760
of almost like paternal pride

21:23.760 --> 21:25.680
because this question was asked five years ago.

21:25.680 --> 21:26.960
I'm just now realizing.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.040
So Biala probably has his mustache shaving game on point.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.520
Or maybe he doesn't because nobody answered his question.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.880
But no one calls Biala anymore.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.320
They call him Scarface Man.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.000
Scarface, but scar lip.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.200
Lipless Jim.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.000
Lipless Joe.

21:44.560 --> 21:45.440
Additional details.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.840
Edit, if I shave my mustache, will it grow thicker?

21:47.840 --> 21:48.720
I don't like that.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.680
I won't cut it then.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.200
Oh, man.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.800
You're going to commit to just having a weird wisp of hair

21:54.800 --> 21:56.800
above your lip for your entire life?

21:56.800 --> 21:57.440
Yeah, just one.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.920
Understand if I were to ever shave it,

21:59.920 --> 22:04.720
I would only become more powerful if I strike it down.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.600
I don't think we've done shaving tips before.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.120
And I imagine we have some pretty hot ones.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.080
We all have different.

22:12.080 --> 22:15.760
See, I use the safety razor and do the wet shaving thing.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.480
I'm not sure that that's what I would recommend for a first timer.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.400
It seems like a fairly advanced move.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.600
Or for somebody who doesn't have like a half hour to kill every day.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.800
My trick, honest to God, I just do it in the shower

22:26.800 --> 22:29.360
and I do it as fast as I possibly fucking can.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.440
Eyes closed, just shaking in the corner.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.480
No, no, no.

22:32.480 --> 22:37.040
I get out of my ceremonial wazai kishi

22:37.600 --> 22:41.760
and I just do a few quick slashes across my face.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.440
And chest, because that's important.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.000
You know what?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.680
Why not now at 14 start rolling up to the barber

22:49.680 --> 22:53.920
and get that like hot lava and just like sit down in the chair

22:53.920 --> 22:55.440
and be like, take care of it, Steve.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.200
Go ahead, Ernie.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.160
Do your worst.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.800
Hey, it's my favorite customer, Ricky.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.040
Ricky, are you getting your new Yu-Gi-Oh cards?

23:05.520 --> 23:06.080
Oh, man.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.920
I mean, we're basically describing Rushmore at this point.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.120
Basically, yes.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.920
Yeah, I remember my first shave.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.360
Do you?

23:15.360 --> 23:17.920
And it kind of bumps me up that you don't have anybody

23:17.920 --> 23:20.800
in your life that can do this for you, Bialo.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.560
You have an older brother, Bialo.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.480
You said he's got all kinds of shit.

23:25.200 --> 23:25.440
Yeah.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.800
Why are you not get-

23:26.800 --> 23:29.280
What is it about your brother's shaving game

23:29.280 --> 23:31.280
that has made him an unreliable source

23:31.280 --> 23:32.240
at this point in your life?

23:32.800 --> 23:34.720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.280
Not like that.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.800
He only does one half of his face at a time

23:38.800 --> 23:41.040
and I can imagine that's right.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.320
My brother has shaved a reverse Fu Manchu on his face.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.320
He starts at the back of his head and works forward

23:48.320 --> 23:52.160
and I don't know much, but he's using acid.

23:52.960 --> 23:53.760
Is that right?

23:53.760 --> 23:54.320
Is that good?

23:54.320 --> 23:56.240
You can always bleach it, so it's just-

23:56.240 --> 23:57.200
Bleach it, sure.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.440
Yeah, that's a great look.

24:00.160 --> 24:04.400
Especially if it grows in, you know, full and selic-y

24:04.400 --> 24:06.240
and then you have dark black hair,

24:06.240 --> 24:08.240
but then like a bleach blonde mustache.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.200
That's actually a really great and bold look.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.720
I'm just saying that we're living in a time

24:12.720 --> 24:14.800
in which mustaches are coming back into vogue

24:14.800 --> 24:16.880
and, Bialo, I say you fucking leave.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.000
I don't think for 14-year-olds it is in vogue.

24:20.000 --> 24:20.640
I think you have to leave.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.760
Well, if he starts now, he can be Sam Elliott

24:23.760 --> 24:25.360
in like 20 years.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.480
You're saying you gotta-

24:26.480 --> 24:27.920
Okay, but what start?

24:27.920 --> 24:29.360
Like starts what?

24:29.360 --> 24:30.400
We also don't know.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.960
We don't know what this guy's voice sounds like.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.480
So what if in 20 years?

24:36.480 --> 24:39.120
Fuck it, what if in three years

24:39.120 --> 24:41.360
he has a full-blown Sam Elliott stache

24:41.360 --> 24:44.320
but he's like, hey guys, what's up?

24:44.320 --> 24:46.480
It's me, Bialo, your buddy.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.800
Yeah, check out my sweet-

24:48.800 --> 24:51.040
Legends are made in the Wild West.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.080
They're not born.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.480
You can't just become a legend.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.320
Let me tell you about Ghost Rider.

24:58.320 --> 25:02.160
Okay, don't start shaving, but do start eating cigars.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.720
If you have that kind of voice mustache combo,

25:04.720 --> 25:06.640
you basically legally have to be obsessed

25:06.640 --> 25:08.000
with balloons and bubbles.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.320
I love them.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.320
I love my bounty friends.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.440
It upsets people how into balloons I am

25:15.440 --> 25:17.920
and also I have this crazy mustache.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.000
Let me walk you through the Roman's Road.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.880
Guys, Jesus' love is just as hip now as it was.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.280
The red bead represents his blood.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.240
The black balloon represents your sin.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.360
We've all got that right.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.720
All right, maybe you were a little short

25:34.720 --> 25:36.960
with your younger brother when he wanted to play

25:36.960 --> 25:39.600
with one of your toys or you looked at a magazine

25:39.600 --> 25:40.640
you weren't supposed to.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.160
Well, let's pop this black bubble.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.080
That's what the love of Jesus is going to do.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.520
Let's all bow our heads in prayer.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.600
While I brush my mustache tenderly.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.320
See, you kids have a mustache brush.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.280
Bialo is the weirdest 17-year-old.

25:53.280 --> 26:07.680
Guys, Valentine's Day is...

26:09.040 --> 26:11.200
I'm talking to guys as in you too.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.040
This message is for both men and women.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.080
Anybody who has a special Valentine,

26:19.360 --> 26:20.720
they want to get something for it.

26:20.720 --> 26:21.840
By the time you're listening to this,

26:21.840 --> 26:24.400
you only have five days left till Valentine's Day.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.600
Sorry, oops, sorry, sorry.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.400
You can do it.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.120
We did our best.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.560
We did our best.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.200
Yeah, oh, sorry.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.280
Also, when I said five, I meant four.

26:33.280 --> 26:33.680
What's up?

26:33.680 --> 26:35.120
I forgot we were recording on Saturday.

26:35.680 --> 26:36.960
How's your week?

26:36.960 --> 26:38.400
Oh, you're obsessed with this now?

26:38.400 --> 26:39.440
Don't worry, we've got you.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.640
You're going to go to proflowers.com

26:42.640 --> 26:47.520
and you're going to get one dozen long-stemmed...

26:47.520 --> 26:50.160
You don't see a lot of short-stem roses, do you?

26:50.160 --> 26:50.640
People don't just-

26:50.640 --> 26:51.920
Boutonnieres.

26:51.920 --> 26:52.400
Boutonnieres.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.120
Assorted roses with a premium vase

26:55.120 --> 26:57.440
and gourmet chocolates gourmet.

26:57.440 --> 27:02.800
Chocolates for $29.99 or double the roses.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.520
You want to really prove you love this person?

27:05.520 --> 27:08.880
Get them two dozen long-stem roses

27:08.880 --> 27:12.960
and the premium vase and the chocolates for $10 more.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.000
Can you imagine that?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.640
They sent us some flowers to let us check them out.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.080
I guess take them for a test drive

27:18.080 --> 27:19.440
and they are beautiful.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.040
I smell everyone.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.000
I smelled everyone.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.120
I tasted them.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.800
Strong color, good finish.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.640
They weren't made of pipe cleaners.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.480
No, they were not fake at all.

27:29.440 --> 27:33.440
But like $40 for two dozen long-stem roses

27:33.440 --> 27:35.200
that come in a vase and chocolates.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.320
You guys have to stop saying vase.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.760
You're killing me inside.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.640
Here's the jingle song that I wrote for Proflowers.

27:44.640 --> 27:49.840
It's about how shitty my brothers are being to me right now.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.520
I'm pretty sure both are correct.

27:52.640 --> 27:56.880
And I think in the UK they would say vase.

27:56.880 --> 27:57.920
It's very European.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.720
The delivery is really quick and easy.

28:02.720 --> 28:06.080
So it's not too late to get them in time for Valentine's Day.

28:06.080 --> 28:07.120
It's very convenient.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.640
The flowers are guaranteed the last seven days

28:12.640 --> 28:15.200
so they won't be like those fucking flowers that you buy

28:15.200 --> 28:18.880
at Sam's Club that are rotten and stinky

28:18.880 --> 28:19.920
by the time you get them home.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.360
Yeah, and it's definitely gonna come on Valentine's Day.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.160
Guaranteed.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.280
So it's great.

28:27.280 --> 28:27.920
You're gonna go to...

28:27.920 --> 28:28.880
Here's what you're gonna do, okay?

28:28.880 --> 28:30.000
This is the only way to get the deal.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.800
Gonna go to proflowers.com...

28:32.800 --> 28:34.960
Gonna go to proflowers.com

28:37.360 --> 28:39.360
and then you're gonna wonder what letters are in that.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.240
Don't think about that.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.480
Just spell it with your heart.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.560
You're gonna go to proflowers.com

28:44.560 --> 28:46.000
and there's like a blue microphone

28:46.000 --> 28:47.120
in the upper right hand corner

28:47.120 --> 28:49.120
and you're gonna type my brother, all one word.

28:49.920 --> 28:50.800
proflowers.com

28:51.360 --> 28:52.720
Click on the microphone.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.720
Type in my brother, all one word.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.560
Do it today.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.920
The deal is only around while they have the supplies for it

28:59.920 --> 29:01.200
and Valentine's Day is this Friday.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.120
So it's like, don't be an idiot.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.760
Just take care of it right now and then you'll be done.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.240
And you can use that code and they're gonna...

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
ProFlowers are gonna think we're powerful.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.440
They'll keep sending us flowers

29:11.440 --> 29:14.480
just because they'll be so proud of us

29:15.040 --> 29:16.640
for doing such a good job.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.960
And let me throw this out just real quick.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.680
Maybe you're one of those people that sits there and goes,

29:21.680 --> 29:23.120
I don't wanna celebrate Valentine's Day

29:23.120 --> 29:25.520
or I don't have a significant other at this point.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.600
You know, why don't you send some to your parents

29:27.600 --> 29:30.000
or to a friend and just say like, happy Valentine's Day.

29:30.000 --> 29:30.480
I love you.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.440
I like that.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.720
It's not a romantic thing.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.800
I'm just taking this opportunity to say you're great

29:34.800 --> 29:35.360
and I appreciate you.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.440
Just buy the flowers so we look good.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.480
Could you do it for us?

29:38.480 --> 29:41.600
Really, long story short, just spend the fucking money.

29:41.600 --> 29:41.920
Please.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.440
Please, we need this.

29:44.560 --> 29:47.040
Guys, my brother and me is supported by Squarespace,

29:47.040 --> 29:49.600

29:59.680 --> 30:01.200
for whatever you want.

30:01.200 --> 30:01.760
They don't...

30:01.760 --> 30:03.600
Here's the thing, they give you the tools

30:03.600 --> 30:04.960
but then they're not like,

30:04.960 --> 30:10.080
you have to make a fan site of the song Smooth

30:11.040 --> 30:12.720
by Carlos Santana.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.240
But you can if you want to.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.120
You can if you want to,

30:15.120 --> 30:18.480
but they don't like put those restrictions on you.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.000
You can freestyle it.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.240
They have a support team that's available for 24-7.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.280
They have a brand new logo generator

30:25.280 --> 30:27.600
so you can design a logo for your site,

30:27.600 --> 30:28.720
maybe a favicon.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.360
And you can start a trial with no credit card

30:47.120 --> 30:48.720

30:48.720 --> 30:50.560
They advertised on the Super Bowl

30:50.560 --> 30:53.280
the same week they advertised on my brother and my brother and me.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.040
It's basically the same thing.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.000
Kind of running the board right now, aren't you, Squarespace?

30:58.000 --> 31:00.240
You're kind of like in charge of shit right now.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.160
You have all your key demos covered,

Everyone in the world uses Squarespace now

31:07.360 --> 31:08.880
because they got everybody.

31:08.880 --> 31:13.760
I got a message for Emily from Artomar Bernard Triscuit and Krang.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.520
Okay, guys, come on.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.120
I think these are animals, Justin.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.320
I think these are made up.

31:18.880 --> 31:19.520
I think they're...

31:19.520 --> 31:21.040
Omar says, I'm a jerk.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.080
Bark, bark, bark.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.280
Bernard says, ghost noises, scamper scamper.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.520
Triscuit says, is it cool if I pee here?

31:27.520 --> 31:29.600
No, cool, I'm going to anyway.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.600
Art says, Merry Christmas a month ago.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.120
Happy anniversary a few weeks ago,

31:33.120 --> 31:36.240
and please remember to buy more chocolate milk.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.400
I think 2014 is the year we'll finally be happy.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.200
Ooh, Art.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.000
A lot of stuff in that.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.280
Here's a fun game.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.320
Only one person in that collection is a human,

31:48.320 --> 31:50.000
and you'll never guess which one.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.360
Spoiler, it's Triscuit.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.600
That's his Christian name.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.320
Yeah, and he has bladder control problems,

31:58.320 --> 31:59.680
and that's not Triscuit's fault, is it?

31:59.680 --> 32:01.440
Is it?

32:01.440 --> 32:03.360
He went to Bonnaroo one year,

32:03.360 --> 32:04.720
and he got chronic prostatitis,

32:05.840 --> 32:06.800
and now he just goes.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.480
Now he just goes and goes and goes.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.640
So happy everything to Emily,

32:10.640 --> 32:12.720
and whichever one of you is a person,

32:12.720 --> 32:15.440
thank you for purchasing an ad on our program.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.880
Unless a dog purchased it,

32:16.880 --> 32:18.880
in which case that would be pretty cool too.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.160
That'd be really neat.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.080
Get that dog on Ellen now.

32:22.640 --> 32:22.960
Please.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.800
Any other messages, Trav?

32:25.760 --> 32:28.400
This one is for Peter Bastion,

32:28.400 --> 32:30.080
and it's from Krista Heiner,

32:30.720 --> 32:31.280
and it says,

32:31.280 --> 32:32.480
Dear Pete, it's me,

32:32.480 --> 32:33.920
your loving girlfriend, Krista.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.040
No, not the loud, mostly toothless cat that lives here.

32:37.040 --> 32:37.920
That's Tony.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.360
I'm your human roommate.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.720
Anyway, happy birthday.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.560
I wish you an adventure-filled year.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.920
Love, Krista and Tony.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.320
P.S., this shout-out was totally my idea.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.160
Tony just added his name at the last second

32:48.160 --> 32:49.760
because he forgot to get you a gift.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.960
Fucking classic Tony.

32:50.960 --> 32:51.680
Fucking Tony.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.400
Tony.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.760
He's been freeloading off you guys.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.440
Listen, you guys need to sit Tony down

32:56.000 --> 32:58.160
and have a very frank talk with him

32:58.160 --> 33:00.240
about his place in your life from now on.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.120
But the problem is, Griffin,

33:01.120 --> 33:02.080
like, he's one of those friends

33:02.080 --> 33:03.360
that's like shitty, shitty, shitty,

33:03.360 --> 33:05.120
but then, like, when you really meet him,

33:05.120 --> 33:07.040
it's like, oh, there he is with a six-pack

33:07.040 --> 33:08.080
because you had a bad day.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.200
It's like, hey, thanks, Tony.

33:09.200 --> 33:09.840
That's cool of you.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.440
Oh, wait, that's our Tony, they call him.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.040
Oh, that's Tony six-pack.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.360
God damn it, Tony, don't get my hopes up.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.640
Bringing in them high-lifes.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.280
Classic fucking Tony.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.640
Classic fucking Tony.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.600
What up, dough?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.680
It's your boy, Jasper Redd,

33:25.680 --> 33:27.760
co-host of The Goose Down,

33:27.760 --> 33:29.840
along with Kimberly Clark,

33:29.840 --> 33:32.560
and some of y'all might be asking yourself,

33:32.560 --> 33:34.480
what the hell is The Goose Down?

33:35.280 --> 33:37.040
It's a comfort food,

33:37.040 --> 33:39.600
and we want y'all to climb underneath it with us

33:39.600 --> 33:42.640
and snuggle up so we can fondle your ears and things.

33:42.640 --> 33:46.080
So come check us out at maximumfun.org,

33:46.080 --> 33:48.560
also available on iTunes.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.060
Jill!

33:49.840 --> 33:51.200
Our very first guest, Bert,

33:52.080 --> 33:53.440
in a delightful portmanteau

33:53.440 --> 33:54.880
created by my youngest brother, Griffin,

33:54.880 --> 33:57.840
is Cameron Esposito,

33:57.840 --> 34:00.400
who is an expert in many things.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.120
She's the host of Wham Bam Pow

34:03.120 --> 34:04.160
on the Maximum Fun Network,

34:04.160 --> 34:06.240
and also Put Your Hands Together,

34:06.240 --> 34:07.920
another podcast for you to enjoy.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.520
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.240
Meet Cameron Esposito.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.040
Hi, guys.

34:12.320 --> 34:13.040
Hi, Cameron.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.680
Do you know I have two sisters?

34:16.560 --> 34:17.520
Do you know that about me?

34:17.520 --> 34:18.080
I didn't know that.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.200
You bunch of brothers.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.680
Did we sort of steal your game?

34:21.680 --> 34:24.240
Did we like, were you like a day away

34:24.240 --> 34:26.240
from publishing My Sister, My Sister and Me?

34:26.240 --> 34:27.360
And then we're like, hold up.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.720
Let me chomp that real quick.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.760
Right, first I was pissed

34:29.760 --> 34:31.360
when Sister, Sister came on the air,

34:31.360 --> 34:32.320
because I was-

34:32.320 --> 34:33.120
And then you were pissed

34:33.120 --> 34:34.800
when Sister, Sister went off the air.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.280
Yeah.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.560
You were like, no, too soon.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.040
And then Sister, Sister, Sister came on the air,

34:39.040 --> 34:41.600
and you're like, what are you doing at this point?

34:41.600 --> 34:42.080
Like, what is-

34:42.080 --> 34:45.840
Cameron, you should absolutely still do that,

34:45.840 --> 34:49.040
and then we will come and we will take everything.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.560
Or joint podcast, like the band,

34:53.120 --> 34:54.240
you know, the band, the band,

34:54.240 --> 34:56.880
and it could be My Brother, My Brother, My Brother,

34:56.880 --> 34:58.720
My Sister, My Sister.

34:58.720 --> 34:59.440
Is that funny?

34:59.440 --> 35:01.440
Like, just saying a bunch of words?

35:01.440 --> 35:02.720
Let's get all of our parents to marry.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.480
Yeah, I mean, that's gotta happen.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.360
Number one, my parents are currently married, but-

35:08.320 --> 35:10.000
You have a plan in mind

35:10.000 --> 35:11.680
if you needed to set it into action.

35:11.680 --> 35:15.200
You know the right words to put that seed.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.120
Yeah, you just say, I'm gay,

35:17.120 --> 35:18.880
and then bam, divorce.

35:18.880 --> 35:19.680
And they're gone.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.040
Bye, parents.

35:21.040 --> 35:21.540
Me too.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.360
Speaking of being gay, which you are-

35:25.360 --> 35:26.560
I am, I'm a homosexual.

35:26.560 --> 35:31.360
You're an expert on gays and their portrayal in the media.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.280
We have lots of questions about that,

35:34.640 --> 35:36.560
and here is one right now.

35:36.560 --> 35:40.160
Sometimes rumors will come up about actresses or musicians

35:40.160 --> 35:42.320
that are private about their personal life,

35:42.320 --> 35:44.080
and possibly being gay.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.920
In circles I run in, at the very least,

35:45.920 --> 35:48.000
the people discussing the matter are very supportive

35:48.000 --> 35:50.240
of whatever floats their particular boat,

35:50.240 --> 35:51.600
but it still seems to me

35:51.600 --> 35:53.920
like they should mind their own business.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.160
Does this behavior cross a line,

35:56.160 --> 35:58.640
or should I just untwist my panties?

35:59.680 --> 36:01.440
That's some clever name here.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.760
Please don't ever use that word again first.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.920
Oh boy, yeah, you wanna talk about offensive.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.440
Is it worse if the panties are twisted or untwisted?

36:11.440 --> 36:16.000
Justin puts some weird English on that particular ball

36:16.000 --> 36:18.960
that makes it just completely unpalatable.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.080
Nika, you in there somewhere.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.320
It's so disgusting.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.960
I have actually a pretty strong reaction to this,

36:28.960 --> 36:34.000
and it's not necessarily PC, as it were,

36:35.360 --> 36:39.120
but I think that people should be out.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.960
I just think that people should be out,

36:40.960 --> 36:42.480
especially if they are,

36:43.680 --> 36:45.360
I don't know what gay rumors really means

36:45.360 --> 36:49.040
in this particular thing, in this particular question.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.640
It's the album rumors covered by a gay ABBA cover band.

36:53.680 --> 36:54.520
Wait, ABBA?

36:54.520 --> 36:56.320
No, wait, Fleetwood Mac, everyone start over.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.960
Start the podcast over, start the podcast over.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.000
Episode one, hi, welcome to my brother and my brother and me.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.880
We know who ABBA is, we definitely know who Fleetwood Mac is.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.320
It seems to me like the question I ask here

37:08.320 --> 37:11.840
is saying if somebody said, I heard Zachary Quinto is gay,

37:11.840 --> 37:12.880
and they're like, oh, what?

37:12.880 --> 37:15.120
No way, he's never said that before,

37:15.120 --> 37:18.240
and be like, I swear he is, I heard it from such and such.

37:18.240 --> 37:21.840
It's really funny that this person thinks that the actors,

37:21.840 --> 37:23.760
I mean, I wonder if this person is in the industry,

37:23.760 --> 37:27.600
only because if not, my love, what a sensitive soul

37:27.600 --> 37:29.760
that they're worried about these actors.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.160
What if it gets back to Quinto?

37:32.160 --> 37:33.920
What if I'm ever in a picture with him?

37:33.920 --> 37:36.000
It's like, hey, I heard you were talking shit.

37:36.800 --> 37:37.600
What's your deal?

37:37.600 --> 37:38.880
Hey, is this Danny?

37:38.880 --> 37:41.440
Listen, it's John Travolta, Johnny T.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.920
Listen, I heard Dan down at My Cross

37:43.920 --> 37:46.080
was talking about whether I was gay or not.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.320
I heard some pretty good goofs who did about my masseuse.

37:48.320 --> 37:48.880
Guess what?

37:48.880 --> 37:50.800
Face Off 2 is canceled.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.920
You were gonna be in it.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.040
I was gonna take your face.

37:53.040 --> 37:53.760
They will never know.

37:54.720 --> 37:58.320
I think that the reason I think that people

37:58.320 --> 38:00.800
that are involved in same-sex relationships

38:00.800 --> 38:04.320
or that are having some sort of same-sex sex

38:04.320 --> 38:05.600
need to say that they are,

38:05.600 --> 38:07.920
because this needs to stop being a rumor.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.120
I hate that it's something that's still like,

38:11.120 --> 38:12.720
for instance, the word that people use

38:14.080 --> 38:16.560
in magazines and stuff when somebody comes out,

38:16.560 --> 38:18.560
so often it'll say like,

38:18.560 --> 38:21.360
such and thus finally admits that they're gay.

38:21.360 --> 38:25.840
Now, the only other things that we admit to doing

38:25.840 --> 38:26.880
are bad things.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.200
It's like you admit to stealing from your mother.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.400
You admit to that one time

38:30.400 --> 38:32.880
where you cut your sister's bangs too short

38:32.880 --> 38:34.160
when you were a child

38:34.160 --> 38:36.080
and you told your mom that actually

38:36.080 --> 38:37.760
your sister cut her own bangs too short.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.400
No one admits to being valedictorian.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.280
So I think that we just have to change this whole tone.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.200
And if you are at your house talking to your friends

38:49.200 --> 38:52.720
about whether or not any particular actor is gay,

38:52.720 --> 38:54.800
I think number one, that's totally okay.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.040
I don't know what damage that could possibly do to them.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.560
These are actors.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.080
If that's who you're talking about,

39:00.080 --> 39:03.040
if you're talking about successful musicians and actors,

39:03.040 --> 39:05.600
these are not generally teenagers,

39:06.480 --> 39:07.440
although some of them are.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.440
And they're not generally people

39:09.440 --> 39:10.640
that still live with their parents

39:10.640 --> 39:12.240
and rely on their parents for money.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.680
And they're not generally people

39:13.680 --> 39:16.720
that are gonna be ostracized by a religious community.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.040
The reasons not to out people

39:19.040 --> 39:21.280
are if that person needs to be protected

39:21.280 --> 39:24.160
and Queen Latifah doesn't need to be protected.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.640
I think it can affect your jobs though.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.160
That's why people still don't

39:28.160 --> 39:30.160
because it's like people worry,

39:30.160 --> 39:33.920
well, can everybody take Zachary Quinto seriously

39:33.920 --> 39:38.400
as a Vulcan that feels no emotions if he's a gay person?

39:39.600 --> 39:43.760
I almost feel like the only way you can pull it off

39:43.760 --> 39:44.800
is if you like,

39:45.360 --> 39:48.320
the only reason that it would be acceptable

39:48.320 --> 39:51.920
is if you're keeping everything about your private life a secret.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.400
Like you show up to set, you do your acting,

39:54.400 --> 39:56.080
and then you just disappear.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.400
You're a ghost, so nobody knows anything.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.480
So then it's not like you're trying to keep our secret,

40:01.200 --> 40:01.680
everything's secret.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.600
I am so glad that you said that.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.760
That is so astute.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.920
And I know that was like a little bit of a joke,

40:07.920 --> 40:08.880
but I don't know if you guys remember

40:08.880 --> 40:12.720
when Jodie Foster got out on stage at the Golden Globes

40:12.720 --> 40:15.200
and like came this close to saying that she was gay,

40:15.200 --> 40:16.480
but instead it was just like,

40:16.480 --> 40:21.040
as we all know, I wear Winky Birkenstocks or whatever.

40:21.040 --> 40:25.200
Somewhere in her freestyle jazz odyssey of a speech,

40:25.200 --> 40:25.920
she sort of touched on it.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.920
If you rearrange all the first letters.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.480
Yeah, but she named every other,

40:30.480 --> 40:31.600
because she kept saying,

40:31.600 --> 40:33.440
I like to keep my private life private,

40:33.440 --> 40:35.120
but then she named, she was like,

40:35.120 --> 40:37.520
but my mother's middle name is this.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.240
And I had this for breakfast.

40:40.240 --> 40:43.120
Here's my kids, why don't you show their faces?

40:43.120 --> 40:46.080
You know, like, I mean, her private life is not private.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.240
So it is hard when it's the only thing

40:48.240 --> 40:49.520
somebody wants to keep private.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.480
I have another question.

40:50.480 --> 40:50.960
Yeah.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
Wait, we can't address my concerns?

40:52.960 --> 40:54.480
Yes, we're addressing your concerns.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.120
Thank you.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.160
Is Macklemore's same love offensive?

40:58.160 --> 40:59.840
Is it the thought that counts?

40:59.840 --> 41:01.840
What about his Grammy performance?

41:01.840 --> 41:03.360
How should I feel about this?

41:03.360 --> 41:07.040
And this is from me, Travis McElroy sitting over here.

41:08.880 --> 41:09.380
What?

41:11.360 --> 41:11.840
Yes.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.680
Sometimes we all need advice

41:14.320 --> 41:17.840
and I don't know how to feel about this whole Macklemore issue.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.120
I love how you say his name.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.160
Can you say that again?

41:20.160 --> 41:20.880
Macklemore?

41:21.440 --> 41:22.480
Yeah, no, that was great.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.400
Is it supposed to be Macklemore?

41:24.400 --> 41:26.160
I prefer to think of it as like Mack

41:26.160 --> 41:28.160
and then like the French word for love.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.760
Oh, that is beautiful.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.240
Same Lemore, you know?

41:32.240 --> 41:35.600
Boys, gentlemen, that song makes me insane.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.040
You guys just picked all the,

41:38.560 --> 41:40.400
I sound like a very negative person,

41:40.400 --> 41:44.480
but any song that is saying

41:44.480 --> 41:48.080
that it is in favor of you having rights

41:48.080 --> 41:51.040
that starts with like a one minute explanation

41:51.040 --> 41:54.000
of how when that person thought they might be like you,

41:54.000 --> 42:02.400
they cried a lot is really tough to get behind.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.440
Okay, I will agree that in that context

42:05.440 --> 42:06.720
it's pretty cut and dry.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.920
Think about other civil rights songs.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.640
Can I read the first line of the song?

42:12.640 --> 42:14.000
Because I sort of got it.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.920
I probably have only heard this song once

42:15.920 --> 42:19.120
and I'm more of a rhythm man.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.280
I listen to the beats instead of the words.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.040
So this is very striking to me.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.400
When I was in the third grade,

42:24.400 --> 42:25.760
I thought that I was gay

42:25.760 --> 42:27.840
because I could draw, my uncle was,

42:27.840 --> 42:29.520
and I kept my room straight.

42:29.520 --> 42:33.840
That's sort of like kind of a crazy like series of evidences

42:33.840 --> 42:35.840
that you use to come to that conclusion.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.240
I know you was eight years old

42:38.240 --> 42:40.720
and maybe that was like enough for you back then,

42:40.720 --> 42:42.240
but that's kind of crazy.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.160
In third grade, I thought that I was gay

42:44.160 --> 42:45.200
because I liked apples

42:45.200 --> 42:48.160
and I saved about $1.50 for my allowance.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.120
And I did my chores.

42:49.120 --> 42:53.280
And people that are defending this song,

42:53.280 --> 42:54.320
that's what they say too.

42:54.320 --> 42:54.960
They're like,

42:54.960 --> 42:57.120
oh, he's talking about how absurd it is

42:57.120 --> 42:58.240
to think that you're gay.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.160
But then the next line is like,

43:00.160 --> 43:01.920
so right after I thought I was gay

43:01.920 --> 43:03.360
for all of these reasons,

43:03.360 --> 43:06.720
like you wouldn't believe how dehydrated I was

43:06.720 --> 43:10.160
from the amount of laying on the floor

43:10.160 --> 43:11.600
and crying I did.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.920
Like I was so sad.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.720
And it's tough.

43:14.720 --> 43:21.760
I mean, if any of the great anti-war songs

43:21.760 --> 43:23.040
from the 1970s,

43:23.040 --> 43:24.400
those songs are about like,

43:25.040 --> 43:26.880
let's keep the peace here.

43:26.880 --> 43:30.800
It's not like I thought maybe I was gonna get drafted

43:31.360 --> 43:36.160
and I was really sad about that.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.000
But these other guys got killed.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.360
Anyway, let's take care of them.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.880
It's a really messed up way to start a song.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.800
I thought I had a hammer.

43:48.720 --> 43:49.760
Also, he references,

43:49.760 --> 43:51.120
there's a line that says,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.160
have you read the YouTube comments lately?

43:54.160 --> 43:56.240
Which I think should be a staple

43:56.240 --> 43:59.840
of all important social movement based songs.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.280
And when he did this performance at the Grammys,

44:03.280 --> 44:06.240
CBS did not bleep the F word,

44:06.240 --> 44:08.240
which I'm not even gonna say in your podcast

44:08.240 --> 44:09.600
because I don't say that word.

44:09.600 --> 44:13.280
But it is a word that is slung at homosexuals.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.080
And he said it on CBS.

44:16.080 --> 44:16.720
No big deal.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.480
They probably say it on like two broke girls

44:18.480 --> 44:19.760
every episode though, so.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.200
But if you think of the equivalent to that,

44:23.920 --> 44:25.840
I mean, nobody's allowed to say the N word

44:25.840 --> 44:27.440
in the middle of a Grammy performance

44:27.440 --> 44:29.120
where people are getting married around them.

44:30.000 --> 44:30.320
Right.

44:30.320 --> 44:32.720
Well, that's a pretty specific set of circumstances.

44:35.920 --> 44:38.800
You know what it made me really sad also

44:38.800 --> 44:40.720
is that the refrain of this song

44:40.720 --> 44:42.160
is also sung by a lesbian.

44:42.800 --> 44:45.120
And it's taken from a song that she,

44:45.840 --> 44:46.880
Mary Lambert's,

44:46.880 --> 44:48.320
like the song that this is taken from

44:48.320 --> 44:49.920
is really beautiful and kind of balanced.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.040
It's a love song.

44:51.040 --> 44:54.000
And in the way that it's dropped into here,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.240
it's like the lyrics are,

44:56.240 --> 44:58.320
I can't change even if I wanted to,

44:58.880 --> 45:00.320
even if I tried.

45:00.960 --> 45:01.680
And I think that,

45:01.680 --> 45:04.080
especially after like somebody saying like,

45:04.080 --> 45:06.000
hey, I thought I was gay.

45:06.560 --> 45:07.920
I cried.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.160
And then like cue the lesbian being like,

45:10.160 --> 45:11.200
trust me,

45:11.200 --> 45:12.800
if I could not be gay,

45:13.440 --> 45:14.320
I would.

45:15.440 --> 45:16.160
Now see, okay,

45:16.160 --> 45:18.720
so because this actually ties into

45:18.720 --> 45:20.080
our last question here.

45:20.080 --> 45:23.200
Macklemore, I think you can obviously,

45:25.120 --> 45:26.400
surprising from someone

45:26.400 --> 45:28.240
that wears such large fur coats,

45:28.240 --> 45:30.560
he was lacking in the tack department.

45:30.560 --> 45:34.000
But I think his intention was probably,

45:34.640 --> 45:36.000
came from a good place.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Our next question asker says,

45:38.000 --> 45:39.520
how do we combat homophobia

45:39.520 --> 45:42.400
in online video gaming communities?

45:42.400 --> 45:45.520
And I would extend that to all online communities,

45:45.520 --> 45:46.000
honestly,

45:46.000 --> 45:49.840
cause internet and encourage LGBT representation

45:49.840 --> 45:52.800
in video games.

45:52.800 --> 45:56.000
And I think Macklemore's song was probably

45:56.000 --> 45:57.440
trying to address this issue.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.280
I can't believe he didn't fix it with a pop song,

46:00.320 --> 46:04.720
but how can we make things better?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.000
How can we make things better?

46:06.000 --> 46:06.880
I mean, number one,

46:06.880 --> 46:08.240
I don't play video games.

46:08.240 --> 46:10.560
So are there gay characters?

46:10.560 --> 46:11.040
Sure.

46:11.040 --> 46:11.440
Yeah.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.160
I mean, not in like,

46:12.880 --> 46:14.480
not in like Call of Duty,

46:14.480 --> 46:15.360
I don't think.

46:15.360 --> 46:16.240
Like not in like the big.

46:16.240 --> 46:16.720
Well, I mean,

46:16.720 --> 46:18.080
those are all gay characters.

46:18.080 --> 46:18.560
I don't know.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.160
It's funny when a gay person calls somebody gay

46:22.160 --> 46:22.880
as an insult,

46:22.880 --> 46:23.200
isn't it?

46:25.120 --> 46:27.040
It seems to me like the only ones I can think of,

46:27.040 --> 46:28.400
it's usually like a joke.

46:28.400 --> 46:29.280
It's usually like,

46:29.280 --> 46:30.640
hey, here's a flamboyant.

46:30.640 --> 46:31.120
No.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.160
Wasn't there a character like that

46:32.160 --> 46:34.480
in Grand Theft Auto IV?

46:34.480 --> 46:36.080
Oh, I'm sure there were all kinds,

46:36.080 --> 46:37.600
but like I don't want to paint

46:37.600 --> 46:38.320
with a pretty broad brush.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.360
Like there absolutely are.

46:39.360 --> 46:40.640
And it definitely is getting better

46:40.640 --> 46:43.280
as like more and more people make these games

46:43.280 --> 46:46.320
and like it becomes a more inclusive medium in general.

46:47.200 --> 46:49.040
Is this person talking about though,

46:49.040 --> 46:51.680
like slurs that might be slung

46:51.680 --> 46:53.680
in online video gaming communities?

46:53.680 --> 46:54.800
Well, video game communities

46:54.800 --> 46:56.160
and video game fictional characters

46:56.160 --> 46:57.840
are two completely different ideas

46:57.840 --> 46:58.960
because like, I don't know,

46:59.520 --> 47:01.360
indie developers are making some pretty cool games

47:01.360 --> 47:02.800
that are sort of tackling these issues

47:02.800 --> 47:05.760
in a really responsible and even-handed way.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.520
Let's limit the question maybe

47:07.520 --> 47:09.040
to just online communities.

47:09.040 --> 47:09.600
That's better.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.000
Would that be?

47:10.000 --> 47:10.560
I like that.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.280
Is that good?

47:11.280 --> 47:12.000
Yeah.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.360
Yeah, homophobia in general.

47:13.360 --> 47:14.560
Like, I don't know.

47:14.560 --> 47:15.760
It's really weird for me

47:15.760 --> 47:17.760
when someone comes from that perspective

47:17.760 --> 47:21.360
because like I almost feel like you need like hours of time

47:21.360 --> 47:24.320
to like change their whole sort of like worldview

47:24.320 --> 47:26.960
if they don't see the immediate problem.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.280
But do you know what's crazy about it to me?

47:29.280 --> 47:32.960
Is that it almost seems like it's a poor translation

47:32.960 --> 47:34.800
in that the words that they're saying,

47:34.800 --> 47:36.000
they don't mean them in that way.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.960
They mean them in like the most base derogatory,

47:38.960 --> 47:41.440
just as a set of derogatory words.

47:42.080 --> 47:43.520
Yeah, no, they're not using it.

47:43.520 --> 47:46.720
They're not using it in like a descriptive nature.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.640
Like, they're not like saying it like,

47:49.280 --> 47:50.480
this is what I think you are.

47:50.480 --> 47:53.760
It's like an expletive for those people.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.120
So that's why I'm wondering if,

47:55.120 --> 47:56.480
rather than try to fix them,

47:56.480 --> 47:58.800
we just set up a different language

47:59.920 --> 48:01.920
of like a whole new set of words

48:01.920 --> 48:03.040
that doesn't offend anyone.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.280
You're talking about like the Battlestar Galactica

48:05.280 --> 48:06.720
sort of crap?

48:06.720 --> 48:08.560
Yes, exactly.

48:10.560 --> 48:11.920
To understand your point, Travis,

48:11.920 --> 48:14.640
you definitely still want the malice

48:14.640 --> 48:16.320
behind these words to be there.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.760
Okay, Cameron Esposito, solve homophobia.

48:21.760 --> 48:25.360
Well, the one thing that I,

48:25.360 --> 48:26.800
this does relate to Rep to Macklemore.

48:26.800 --> 48:27.840
I'm gonna tie it all in.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.320
Put a nice Macklemore bow on it.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.040
I, for one, am pretty,

48:33.920 --> 48:36.320
and it also, it actually goes back to that first question

48:36.320 --> 48:37.840
that we talked about too.

48:37.840 --> 48:43.840
I'm pretty done with hearing straight men specifically,

48:43.840 --> 48:45.520
because it often comes from straight men.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.440
I think straight men are the scaredest

48:47.440 --> 48:49.040
of the idea that they might be gay.

48:49.040 --> 48:51.840
And I think that comes from fear of butt sex.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.360
I have a whole treatise about it.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.560
You can read it nowhere.

48:56.160 --> 48:58.240
But I think that straight men are the scaredest

48:58.240 --> 49:00.080
of people thinking that they're gonna be gay.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.800
And I feel like that is something that,

49:02.800 --> 49:04.880
if there are any men that listen to this podcast,

49:04.880 --> 49:06.720
which I'm sure there's two to three.

49:06.720 --> 49:07.840
There's one or two.

49:07.840 --> 49:11.600
Yeah, that you could just work on letting go

49:11.600 --> 49:13.440
of that fear within yourself.

49:13.440 --> 49:16.160
That's really how we're gonna solve homophobia,

49:16.160 --> 49:18.240
because I think that's what it's all about.

49:18.240 --> 49:22.320
Yeah, because religion doesn't really cover it.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.320
You know, I don't wanna get married in a church.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.560
And it's not like tradition that's really the problem,

49:26.560 --> 49:28.080
because many people are divorced.

49:28.080 --> 49:31.520
It's really this fear that I think a lot of guys still carry

49:31.520 --> 49:33.680
that somebody is gonna come up to them

49:33.680 --> 49:35.360
while they're in middle school as an adult

49:35.360 --> 49:37.680
and call them gay and push them into a locker.

49:37.680 --> 49:41.440
And I feel like you just gotta make peace with that.

49:41.440 --> 49:45.520
I mean, Macklemore taking his time to say that like,

49:45.520 --> 49:47.680
hey, he understands what it is to be gay

49:47.680 --> 49:50.000
because he used to think he was gay

49:50.000 --> 49:52.240
is not the same as just saying,

49:52.240 --> 49:53.760
I actually totally don't know

49:53.760 --> 49:57.600
what you guys are going through because I am not gay,

49:57.600 --> 49:58.880
but I'm just an advocate for you.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.160
Look, look, I get it, okay?

50:00.160 --> 50:01.760
I cleaned my room when I was eight.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.320
Look, I get it, okay?

50:04.320 --> 50:06.640
Listen, my uncle, I totally get it.

50:06.640 --> 50:08.000
I have one more question, Cameron,

50:08.000 --> 50:09.280
before I will let you go.

50:09.280 --> 50:12.000
And this is one from just from me.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.880
We had Dan Savage on our show a long time ago,

50:14.880 --> 50:17.360
and he said queer a lot.

50:17.360 --> 50:21.760
And I just wanted to ask you if that was okay to say now

50:21.760 --> 50:23.920
or what is the status update on that?

50:24.560 --> 50:27.920
I'm gonna status update you on queer so hardcore right now.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.720
Queer, completely fine to say

50:30.720 --> 50:32.960
if you are saying it in a positive way.

50:32.960 --> 50:34.000
You can't call someone queer.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.040
I would, I only would.

50:35.040 --> 50:38.240
But you can't be like, you're queer.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.240
But you can be like, you're queer.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.320
Did you get that?

50:42.320 --> 50:42.820
Yes.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.760
Can you give me those intonations just one more time?

50:45.760 --> 50:46.640
Just one more time.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.440
What if I use it in the-

50:47.440 --> 50:49.760
He's like, you're queer versus like, you're queer.

50:49.760 --> 50:51.920
What about in the interrogative sense?

50:51.920 --> 50:52.720
Like, you're queer?

50:52.720 --> 50:54.880
Yeah, no, you could definitely do that.

50:54.880 --> 50:55.760
That actually is great,

50:55.760 --> 50:56.880
because it's kind of open-ended

50:56.880 --> 50:58.080
and there's like a sweetness to it.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.720
What about like a cockney flair?

51:00.720 --> 51:03.120
So like, hey, governor, you're queer.

51:04.800 --> 51:07.360
But you got, but he fell off the roof at the end of it.

51:08.240 --> 51:09.200
Cameron, this is important.

51:09.200 --> 51:09.920
Can we use it?

51:09.920 --> 51:11.040
Can we just have fun with it

51:11.040 --> 51:14.560
like we've been doing for the past 60 seconds?

51:14.560 --> 51:18.640
Can I do it in a baby voice?

51:18.640 --> 51:21.520
You can use queer anytime you would use LGBT.

51:22.320 --> 51:22.800
Okay.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.080
Because GLBT or LGBT or whatever it is,

51:26.080 --> 51:28.240
is kind of like a 90s term.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.200
Like, whenever I hear that,

51:29.200 --> 51:32.480
I always think of like really wide leg jeans

51:32.480 --> 51:37.040
and like a backwards newsboy cap, you know?

51:37.040 --> 51:37.280
Like-

51:37.280 --> 51:39.600
You think of JNCO is what you're telling me.

51:40.320 --> 51:40.820
Yes.

51:40.820 --> 51:45.460
Yes, queer is like a much more asymmetrical haircuts,

51:45.460 --> 51:49.620
like mustaches on men and women and granola.

51:49.620 --> 51:50.900
It's like a little bit more of an updated term.

51:50.900 --> 51:52.980
It's a pair of boot cut jeans from Express.

51:53.700 --> 51:55.780
Yes, exactly.

51:56.740 --> 51:58.980
Cameron Esposito, thank you so much for joining us.

51:58.980 --> 52:01.380
We sure appreciate you taking the time.

52:02.500 --> 52:04.580
Again, you're on Wham Bam Pow.

52:05.140 --> 52:07.460
You are on Put Your Hands Together.

52:08.260 --> 52:09.460
What else do you do, Cameron?

52:09.460 --> 52:09.860
Twitter?

52:09.860 --> 52:10.740
Do you tweet, tweet?

52:10.740 --> 52:12.740
Yeah, at Cameron Esposito.

52:12.740 --> 52:15.620
And I guess my final question for you guys would be just like,

52:15.620 --> 52:16.900
do you think we solved it?

52:16.900 --> 52:19.220
You know, Macklemore set it up and we spiked it.

52:19.220 --> 52:20.820
Cameron Esposito, thank you so much.

52:20.820 --> 52:21.860
Have a great day, guys.

52:21.860 --> 52:22.360
You too.

52:22.980 --> 52:23.940
You guys want a Yahoo?

52:23.940 --> 52:24.580
Yeah, please.

52:24.580 --> 52:24.980
Yes.

52:24.980 --> 52:26.340
This Yahoo was sent in by Julie Martin.

52:26.340 --> 52:26.820
Thanks, Julie.

52:26.820 --> 52:29.220
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amber Kay who asks,

52:29.940 --> 52:32.500
how would you describe a food court to someone

52:32.500 --> 52:34.180
who has never been to one?

52:34.180 --> 52:35.620
Oh God, good question.

52:35.620 --> 52:38.100
I have to describe a food court in French for homework

52:38.100 --> 52:40.660
in four to six sentences since apparently food quarks

52:40.660 --> 52:41.780
are an American thing.

52:41.780 --> 52:42.980
Uh, you fucking thing.

52:42.980 --> 52:44.820
Yeah, no kidding.

52:44.820 --> 52:47.220
I want to get some chicken nugs and some sparrows

52:47.220 --> 52:47.940
in the same bite.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.740
How would you describe a food court to someone

52:50.740 --> 52:52.100
who doesn't know what one is?

52:52.100 --> 52:53.540
It doesn't have to be in French.

52:53.540 --> 52:54.660
I will do that.

52:54.660 --> 52:58.100
All I have so far is a place where several restaurants are

52:58.100 --> 53:00.420
that people go to eat after shopping.

53:00.420 --> 53:01.700
I mean, you kind of got it.

53:01.700 --> 53:03.780
Okay, wait, hold on, hold on.

53:04.420 --> 53:05.780
That's a ridiculous question.

53:05.780 --> 53:08.340
Then, like, how do I describe snow?

53:09.220 --> 53:11.300
All I've got so far is it's frozen water

53:11.300 --> 53:13.380
that falls from the sky and accumulates on the ground.

53:13.380 --> 53:13.620
But that's-

53:13.620 --> 53:14.820
Well, I mean, also-

53:14.820 --> 53:17.780
She's done nothing to capture the spirit of the thing.

53:17.780 --> 53:18.100
Okay.

53:18.100 --> 53:18.740
The magic of it.

53:18.740 --> 53:20.900
And she's also sort of mischaracterized it, I think,

53:20.900 --> 53:23.620
because, like, you don't always go to the food court.

53:24.580 --> 53:28.580
Sometimes the food court is a dining destination.

53:28.580 --> 53:29.300
Oh, I see.

53:29.300 --> 53:29.700
It's not a-

53:29.700 --> 53:31.140
Sometimes that's your sole purpose.

53:31.140 --> 53:32.420
It's not a pit stop.

53:32.420 --> 53:37.460
It's in between fucking Suncoast and the Sunglass Hut.

53:37.940 --> 53:41.220
Like, sometimes it's just sort of why you went to the mall.

53:41.220 --> 53:44.820
Okay, so let's do some flavor text to make it, like,

53:44.820 --> 53:46.660
that much of a throwback in a world.

53:46.660 --> 53:50.740
Imagine stepping into the Garden of Eden,

53:51.300 --> 53:54.660
except instead of a bunch of shitty stuff,

53:54.660 --> 53:57.940
like fruit and trees and everything,

53:57.940 --> 54:03.540
you could reach out your hand and pluck some Chick-fil-A.

54:04.180 --> 54:05.140
This is the food court.

54:05.140 --> 54:06.740
You can eat at the Big Loafer.

54:07.380 --> 54:10.500
You could eat at Orange Panda Express.

54:11.700 --> 54:14.180
Other people probably don't know what the Big Loafer is, do they?

54:14.180 --> 54:16.900
I love that you guys have moved on

54:16.900 --> 54:19.060
away from beautiful Huntington, West Virginia,

54:19.060 --> 54:21.460
the greatest little city in this nation of ours,

54:21.460 --> 54:24.500
and yet your images of malls and food courts

54:24.500 --> 54:27.060
are still indelibly locked to Huntington, West Virginia.

54:27.060 --> 54:28.580
So Big Loafer, I guess,

54:29.300 --> 54:31.460
how do you describe a Big Loafer to someone

54:31.460 --> 54:32.820
who has never been to one?

54:32.820 --> 54:33.320
Easy.

54:34.260 --> 54:36.100
Pepperoni rolls and that's it.

54:36.820 --> 54:37.540
What do you got?

54:37.540 --> 54:39.380
Soda and pepperoni rolls, you in?

54:39.380 --> 54:41.540
Like, fuck yeah, I'm in Big Loafer.

54:41.540 --> 54:42.980
Thanks for the e-vite.

54:42.980 --> 54:44.420
I think also next to the Big Loafer

54:44.420 --> 54:46.340
was the specialty popcorn store.

54:46.340 --> 54:49.940
Yeah, Caramel Corn with a K was the name of that store.

54:50.820 --> 54:51.700
And it burned down.

54:54.020 --> 54:56.820
It was the best smelling fire basically ever,

54:56.820 --> 54:57.860
and also the loudest.

54:58.420 --> 55:02.100
The Big Loafer, it has a thing called the Big Loafer

55:02.100 --> 55:03.140
that you can buy there.

55:04.260 --> 55:05.700
Yes, it is made of meatloaf.

55:06.580 --> 55:12.260
And it also has cookies that are filled with chocolate

55:12.260 --> 55:13.780
and pepperoni rolls.

55:13.780 --> 55:15.780
So I guess just translate that to French.

55:15.780 --> 55:18.500
Jamie Oliver, when he was shooting the TV show Fat City

55:18.500 --> 55:19.700
in Huntington, West Virginia,

55:20.660 --> 55:22.500
he went to the Big Loafer,

55:22.500 --> 55:24.420
realized that he had failed his

55:24.420 --> 55:27.060
it's a wonderful life-esque angel mission,

55:27.060 --> 55:28.340
and then just like pulled the ripcord

55:28.340 --> 55:30.580
and went back to heaven and disappeared on the spot.

55:31.780 --> 55:35.220
Now, I wanna warn you about the sandwiches at Big Loafer.

55:35.220 --> 55:37.140
They're a little pricey at $5.

55:38.420 --> 55:39.460
Wow, really?

55:39.460 --> 55:42.500
Yeah, well, that's what the Big Loafer is gonna cost you.

55:43.380 --> 55:44.420
Because I love you guys,

55:44.420 --> 55:47.620
I looked up this quick story on the Herald Dispatch

55:47.620 --> 55:48.660
about the Big Loafer,

55:48.660 --> 55:51.700
and here's a quote from the guy who runs Big Loafer.

55:51.700 --> 55:55.540
"'I've estimated that about 40% of the people

55:55.540 --> 55:58.820
"'who have walked by our restaurant have never tried it,'

55:58.820 --> 55:59.940
"'Michael Burdick said.

56:00.500 --> 56:04.100
"'A $5 investment in a sandwich is a lot

56:04.100 --> 56:05.940
"'if you don't know what you're getting.

56:06.660 --> 56:09.140
"'But once people have tried our food,

56:09.140 --> 56:16.980
"'999 out of 1,000 are gonna go, wow.

56:18.180 --> 56:20.260
"'They find it's a great value for their money.'"

56:20.260 --> 56:24.420
Wow, am I going to have diarrhea for a month?

56:24.420 --> 56:26.100
No, no, no, no, no.

56:26.100 --> 56:26.580
What have I done?

56:26.580 --> 56:27.060
What have I done?

56:27.060 --> 56:27.860
$5 for this?

56:28.420 --> 56:29.860
I've gotta call my wife.

56:29.860 --> 56:31.220
If I wanted to get diarrhea,

56:31.220 --> 56:32.900
I could probably get it for like 65 cents.

56:33.460 --> 56:34.820
If I spent my money wisely.

56:34.820 --> 56:35.860
God damn it.

56:35.860 --> 56:39.220
This is a great comment on the fatalistic nature

56:39.220 --> 56:40.740
of many West Virginians,

56:40.740 --> 56:42.260
that they would actually think,

56:42.900 --> 56:44.900
wait, I'm gonna put it into my body?

56:44.900 --> 56:46.820
I'm not gonna pay $5 for that.

56:48.100 --> 56:49.060
I'm just gonna turn it into poop.

56:49.060 --> 56:50.740
What kind of library living where you think

56:50.740 --> 56:52.900
of buying a sandwich as an investment?

56:52.900 --> 56:53.380
Yeah.

56:53.380 --> 56:55.300
It's a $5 investment in finding out

56:55.300 --> 56:56.260
of this sandwich place.

56:56.260 --> 56:58.500
Well, maybe that Big Loafer is gonna give you

56:58.500 --> 57:03.540
the calories that you need to invent Facebook too.

57:03.540 --> 57:04.820
The sequel to Facebook.

57:05.540 --> 57:07.780
If you could, honey, then don't get a Big Loafer.

57:07.780 --> 57:09.140
I don't know what's wrong with you.

57:09.140 --> 57:09.940
Stop it.

57:09.940 --> 57:11.220
You have to stop it.

57:11.220 --> 57:12.660
Thank you so much for listening

57:12.660 --> 57:15.300
to our Big Loafer fan cast, the Loaf Bros.

57:15.300 --> 57:19.220
We hope you had a Loaf-ly time.

57:20.420 --> 57:22.820
We wanna thank those of you-

57:22.820 --> 57:25.860
Guys, this was a big episode for us.

57:25.860 --> 57:26.100
Yeah.

57:26.740 --> 57:28.660
Yeah, there was no loafing here.

57:28.660 --> 57:29.780
We were just going for it.

57:30.580 --> 57:33.220
We should drop this loaf and let people listen to it.

57:33.220 --> 57:35.300
Okay, well, okay.

57:36.260 --> 57:37.540
Thank you to people tweeting about the show

57:37.540 --> 57:39.220
like Hamish Strong, Sarah Mool.

57:40.100 --> 57:42.020
NBNBAM Wisdom is a Twitter account

57:42.020 --> 57:43.540
that you should absolutely be following

57:43.540 --> 57:46.340
because it just tweets quotes from our show

57:46.340 --> 57:49.060
and it's every once in a while I'll catch myself

57:49.060 --> 57:50.820
laughing at it and then feel like a real dickhead.

57:52.180 --> 57:55.460
Emily Allen, Joe Smith, Grant S, Sarah Rollin,

57:55.460 --> 57:58.420
Alex Robbins, Sunny Webster, James Elliott,

57:59.700 --> 58:04.100
Maggie Rossetti, Josh Lang, Chris Traslavina,

58:05.460 --> 58:06.420
and so many others.

58:06.420 --> 58:07.940
Thank you for recommending our show

58:07.940 --> 58:08.980
to your friends and family.

58:08.980 --> 58:09.860
It means a lot.

58:10.580 --> 58:12.500
And a big thanks to Cameron Esposito

58:12.500 --> 58:13.700
for being our first desperate

58:13.700 --> 58:15.780
for testing out these choppy waters.

58:16.580 --> 58:20.180
If you have somebody that you want to see on the show,

58:20.820 --> 58:22.260
I mean, we're not going to do this every week,

58:22.260 --> 58:24.980
I don't think, but shoot us an email

58:24.980 --> 58:27.780
at mbnbam at maximumfun.org

58:27.780 --> 58:31.220
and we'll try to reach out.

58:31.220 --> 58:31.780
We'll try to-

58:31.780 --> 58:32.980
Make sure to check out her show,

58:33.860 --> 58:35.860
MNBNPOW and Put Your Hands Together

58:35.860 --> 58:38.980
and all the other awesome maximumfun.org shows.

58:38.980 --> 58:41.940
Yeah, like The Goose Down, Sawbones,

58:41.940 --> 58:43.940
Jordan and Jesse Go, Judge John Hodgman,

58:43.940 --> 58:45.300
there's a grip of them.

58:45.300 --> 58:46.020
So go check it out.

58:46.020 --> 58:48.180
And a big thanks to John Roderick

58:48.180 --> 58:49.940
and The Long Winters for these theme song,

58:49.940 --> 58:51.780
It's a Departure, off the album,

58:51.780 --> 58:53.140
Putting the Days to Bed.

58:53.140 --> 58:56.420
It's a fine album, fine album,

58:56.420 --> 58:59.540
sold where all albums are sold, I guess.

58:59.540 --> 59:00.900
And also a big loafer.

59:00.900 --> 59:01.300
They have a stack of them.

59:01.300 --> 59:02.660
Also a big loafer.

59:02.660 --> 59:04.020
It's like Starbucks

59:04.020 --> 59:05.460
where they have the albums at the front,

59:05.460 --> 59:08.580
but it's only Seattle-based indie rock.

59:08.580 --> 59:13.940
And thank you so much for listening to our program.

59:13.940 --> 59:15.380
It really means a lot to us.

59:16.180 --> 59:18.500
Make sure to join us again next Monday

59:18.500 --> 59:20.100
when we'll be back with you.

59:20.100 --> 59:21.940
Until then, Griffin has a question

59:21.940 --> 59:23.220
for you to think about and ponder.

59:23.220 --> 59:26.340
Yeah, it was sent in by Jeff and Kami.

59:27.380 --> 59:28.660
Thank you, Jeff and Kami.

59:29.780 --> 59:32.180
It's by Yahoo Answers user Williams

59:32.180 --> 59:33.300
who asks,

59:33.300 --> 59:37.860
how much gum in my pubes is too much?

59:37.860 --> 59:40.820
I'm Justin McElroy.

59:40.820 --> 59:41.780
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:41.780 --> 59:42.660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:42.660 --> 59:43.860
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

59:43.860 --> 59:44.820
Kiss your dad.

59:44.820 --> 01:00:04.660
Swear on the lips.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.580
Maximumfun.org.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.620
Comedy and culture.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:08.740
Artist-owned.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.780
Listener-supported.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.180
Justin, what are you doing?

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.740
I'm strapping a chicken in my arm.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.420
Heard there's some plague out west,

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.460
so I just wanted to, you know,

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.140
kind of get out ahead of it.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.420
Justin, if you'd ever listened

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.420
to our medical history podcast,

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.420
Sawbones, where we talk about everything

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.420
from trepanation to bloodletting,

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.500
you would know that that is a ridiculous idea

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.540
and it will never work.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500
Sawbones, I haven't caught it.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:34.980
Sawbones?

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.540
Yes, it's every Friday

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:38.980
on the Maximum Fun Network

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.740
and we record it together.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.300
You a doctor or something?

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:43.940
I'm a doctor.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:01:13.860
Yes.
