00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.880
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say, hey I wanna.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.280
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the

00:47.280 --> 00:51.840
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.840 --> 00:58.720
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. God, guys, we have been fucking with audio shit

00:58.720 --> 01:06.000
for a literal hour. 63 minutes by my count. 63 minutes we've been fucking with audio shit.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.640
We're professional podcasters in theory. Nobody has as many podcasts as we do,

01:11.280 --> 01:17.440
and it's still an issue for us, and all I can say is Thanksgiving cannot come soon enough.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.960
We had all these great plans to talk about Thanksgiving, this wonderful holiday

01:20.960 --> 01:24.160
that we're going to talk about, which is I guess is where you just smoke a bunch of that sweet

01:24.160 --> 01:30.400
sheep, and then- Out of a bong shaped like a turkey. Okay, do you eat the turkey afterward?

01:30.960 --> 01:34.720
Hell yeah. Wait, is it a turkey, or is it just shaped like a turkey?

01:34.720 --> 01:39.120
Nah, dude, I can bong out a turkey for sure, but my problem is I no longer want to talk about

01:39.120 --> 01:44.800
Thanksgiving because the last 63 minutes have crushed my soul. We could have recorded a podcast

01:44.800 --> 01:50.400
in that time. But think about all the things you have to give thanks for, Griffin. The fact that

01:50.400 --> 01:56.880
we are even able to communicate like this in this modern era is a miracle. Yeah, I definitely get

01:56.880 --> 02:02.160
that. It's just like if I can find myself in the mood to record a comedy advice podcast right now,

02:02.160 --> 02:08.160
it'll be a fucking Thanksgiving miracle. Travis, how's your Thanksgiving spirit?

02:09.520 --> 02:14.800
Honestly, it's doing great, Justin. Thank you for asking. Since I'm the one that seems to be

02:14.800 --> 02:19.760
a half a second behind everybody, I feel like I'm time traveling when we record this episode.

02:19.760 --> 02:24.560
This is what life used to be like a half a second in the past, and for that I am thankful.

02:25.200 --> 02:31.360
I used to record a podcast with a dude from South Africa. It was smoother than this. It went better

02:31.360 --> 02:37.200
on a regular basis. He was getting attacked by lions every episode, and it still went better

02:37.200 --> 02:41.680
than this. Maybe there was something there. Travis, can you fight off a big cat?

02:41.680 --> 02:50.240
I'll see what I can do. It's Los Angeles. City of big cats is what that translates to.

02:51.360 --> 02:58.400
Let's get back to Thanksgiving. I feel like there's a lot of meat on the Thanksgiving bones.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.000
I haven't been very playful, and I feel like that's my fault. That's on me. Let's get back

03:04.000 --> 03:13.680
to it. What are some of the side dishes that go into Thanksgiving? It would just be the regular

03:13.680 --> 03:20.560
side dishes, right? Pretty much everything you eat at Thanksgiving already is food for a high person.

03:20.560 --> 03:25.760
Sweet potatoes with marshmallows on top? You were high when you came up with that. Guaranteed.

03:27.200 --> 03:33.600
Guaranteed Baptist moms. I'm sitting here. I'm working so hard in my head to make more puns

03:33.600 --> 03:40.720
based on... For some reason, I'm stuck on cranberry, but I can't find it. I don't

03:40.720 --> 03:47.920
know that there's anything there. Is this something? Can we talk about how Thanksgiving

03:47.920 --> 03:57.600
was first celebrated by pioneer chill-grooms? Okay, that's good. It helped them to celebrate

03:57.600 --> 04:01.200
the fact that the Native Americans, which they did not call them at that time...

04:01.200 --> 04:05.040
No, they didn't. Now we have the good sense to call them that.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.440
The Native Americans helped them discover corn, or as their people called it,

04:09.440 --> 04:17.120
haze. All right. Is that a thing? Is there something there Thanksgiving?

04:17.120 --> 04:24.320
Are we shoehorning ourselves into weed culture a little bit too much? We had a run in the last

04:24.320 --> 04:29.200
couple episodes. We talked about Batman villains and how we could fit weed jokes into there.

04:29.200 --> 04:37.600
We don't smoke a lot of the kindness between the three of us. I think I have some dank

04:37.600 --> 04:40.880
imposter syndrome going right now. Yeah, I know what you mean.

04:40.880 --> 04:49.840
I'm trying to stay relevant. I feel myself aging out of the world in a Logan's Run kind of way.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.120
I want to be the first old person to try to stay cool longer.

04:55.120 --> 05:02.080
Do you know the temperature? This is a safety part of Thanksgiving. You know the proper

05:02.800 --> 05:08.480
temperature to cook your turkey at. Now, I do want to cut this off at the head

05:08.480 --> 05:14.800
because I do think you're about to say 420, and that is actually very dangerous. I feel too

05:14.800 --> 05:22.000
dangerous to even joke about that temperature. No, I mean, 420 would be a fast-cooking bird.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.840
I don't think you're going to get top flavor. You're not going to get an internal cook.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.640
You don't want to do stuffing in the middle if you're baking at 420.

05:28.640 --> 05:34.480
Usually the reason we talk about weed jokes is that there's enough weed slang that puns

05:34.480 --> 05:43.600
become very easy. They usually come fast and furious. Unfortunately, Thanksgiving was not the

05:43.600 --> 05:53.360
ripe vein that I thought that it would be. I thought there'd be a lot of fruit to be plucked

05:53.360 --> 05:58.240
from this particular vine, but you know what? We do the show in real time. You can't really penalize

05:58.240 --> 06:06.880
us when things don't pan out. That's the nature of the theater of the mind that we present here

06:06.880 --> 06:10.960
on a weekly basis at My Brother, My Brother and Me. Sometimes theater is just not very good.

06:10.960 --> 06:17.200
Yeah, sometimes theater is bad. This isn't a show about comedy professionals performing

06:17.200 --> 06:23.440
pre-scripted material. It's a communion really between friends, and sometimes your friends

06:24.080 --> 06:28.080
try to do pot jokes about Thanksgiving, and it doesn't pan out so well, but we're all still

06:28.080 --> 06:30.320
friends at the end of it, and that's what matters. That's what Thanksgiving is all about.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.200
Listen, if you want to watch good Thanksgiving comedy, just watch Friends.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.800
Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, that's a good point.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.360
Or Fringe.

06:38.080 --> 06:38.720
Or Fringe.

06:38.720 --> 06:45.440
Fringe. Yeah, they had that episode where they had to solve a sci-fi murder by

06:46.000 --> 06:48.960
getting their head stuck in a turkey, huh? Do you remember that one?

06:51.440 --> 06:57.520
The old scientist man was like, I know where I can find the solution to this one,

06:57.520 --> 06:59.440
and he got his head stuck in a turkey.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.840
If we examine the cornea of this turkey, we'll see the last thing it saw before it died,

07:03.840 --> 07:08.720
and we'll be able to, oh, it was just a mill. Just a mill where they turned turkey into turkey.

07:09.920 --> 07:14.000
That's weird if you think about it. Turkey the animal and turkey the food are really

07:14.000 --> 07:17.040
the same thing, but you wouldn't really use that word the same way.

07:17.680 --> 07:20.560
Did you start celebrating Thanksgiving early this year, Justin?

07:21.680 --> 07:22.480
Sounds like it.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.240
It's just a weird thing to think about.

07:24.240 --> 07:28.000
Hey, you guys ever thought about birds? Like, what are they doing up there?

07:28.000 --> 07:34.640
It's like they're pigs. Okay, but like pigs have this where it's a pig, Charlotte's web,

07:35.440 --> 07:38.640
and then it's pork is what's for dinner.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.040
I understand what Justin's saying, yeah.

07:41.040 --> 07:47.120
But turkey doesn't get that, which must be like that. That's a layer of abstraction

07:47.120 --> 07:50.960
that pigs do not allow themselves. Oh, what are humans eating today? Pork.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.840
Pork is very hot. Oh, I wonder what pork is. Well, we'll never find out.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.480
Turkeys don't get that.

07:56.480 --> 08:00.480
What can we, can you come up? Turkey's just no, one and one, that's my brother.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.200
Oh, you mean turkey. Can you come up for me, Justin,

08:03.200 --> 08:07.120
a name for an abstraction of turkey meat, what that would be called?

08:09.040 --> 08:09.920
Yeah, no problem.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.640
I'm just, you're asking me to create a word from whole cloth.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.320
Yeah, no, it's a, take your time.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.600
What, what about, what about this?

08:24.240 --> 08:24.740
Kay.

08:24.740 --> 08:27.220
Kay. Pork too. Now hold on.

08:29.460 --> 08:32.820
I edited most of that out, but that took you like almost a good minute and a half.

08:33.460 --> 08:41.060
Yeah, pork too, uh, is, is, is maybe that's another thing that, that you could go with.

08:41.060 --> 08:41.940
Pork too.

08:41.940 --> 08:42.820
Can I hit you with this?

08:43.540 --> 08:43.860
Yeah.

08:43.860 --> 08:46.020
How do you, how do you guys feel about good bird?

08:48.740 --> 08:48.980
Good bird.

08:48.980 --> 08:52.820
So you can have like a slice, a white, a white meat slice of good bird.

08:52.820 --> 08:56.100
And that sort of, that's, that abstracts it a little bit.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.140
We do the same thing with chicken.

08:57.140 --> 08:58.500
We do the same thing with duck.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.900
And I feel like all, all of that falls into the same.

09:00.900 --> 09:05.540
Yes, I guess you could call it poultry if you, if you want to be, um, a jerk about it.

09:05.540 --> 09:09.780
But can, may I reckon, may I just slide my foot in the door here and say,

09:09.780 --> 09:12.740
and say the word good bird into that crack in the door that I've just made.

09:13.780 --> 09:14.660
Let me throw this out.

09:14.660 --> 09:17.060
Something that's fun to say and fun to eat.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.060
That's the tagline, right?

09:19.060 --> 09:19.560
Waddle.

09:20.740 --> 09:21.860
Oh my God.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.060
Have a slice of waddle.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.540
I love that Travis, some waddle.

09:26.180 --> 09:29.860
That's a nice, that's a nice thing to do for turkey to start calling it waddle

09:29.860 --> 09:33.140
because that's a layer of abstraction that they can find some comfort in.

09:33.780 --> 09:37.220
No one, no turkey knows where waddle comes from.

09:37.220 --> 09:41.140
And that's, that is a blanket that they like to sleep under at night.

09:41.140 --> 09:41.700
You know?

09:41.700 --> 09:44.980
Fellas, we've, uh, we found the, I think we found the nugget in here.

09:44.980 --> 09:47.620
Uh, and I think we've really extracted and juiced that nug.

09:47.620 --> 09:51.620
So let's, uh, well you say we move on to some advice, huh?

09:51.620 --> 09:53.620
Why aren't there waddle nugs?

09:53.620 --> 09:55.620
I would eat a waddle nug no problem.

09:55.620 --> 09:56.180
Oh my God.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.940
Waddle nugs with gravy dip and sauce, I guess.

09:59.940 --> 10:00.420
Yeah.

10:00.420 --> 10:01.300
Don't mind if I do.

10:02.660 --> 10:05.380
Uh, so this is a comedy advice show.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.740
We get half of that usually.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.700
Um, except for the episodes where we get neither.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.860
And this is who knows which this one will be.

10:11.860 --> 10:13.780
You'll know at the end of this in about an hour or so.

10:14.340 --> 10:18.980
Uh, you know what I would be really thankful for is if somebody would program us a

10:18.980 --> 10:25.860
fucking telecommunication solution that doesn't shit the bed once every other one time.

10:25.860 --> 10:30.340
Travis is, is using his phone to call into Skype to improve our lag.

10:30.340 --> 10:34.660
And right now it sounds like he's balancing his checkbook with his nipples.

10:34.660 --> 10:37.620
It's an absolute fucking pit.

10:37.620 --> 10:41.140
It's like he's been giving me beard kisses in my ear for the last 13 minutes.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.740
That's what it is, isn't it?

10:42.740 --> 10:44.340
Those are your beard scrapings.

10:44.340 --> 10:47.220
Those are your audio beard scrapings that only we can enjoy.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.500
Ugh.

10:48.500 --> 10:52.580
My office likes to celebrate birthdays and I must live in a time vortex because it feels

10:52.580 --> 10:54.980
like we celebrated a new birthday every week.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.060
Not every birthday with 52 people.

10:57.060 --> 10:58.340
That's not that crazy.

10:58.900 --> 10:59.140
Yeah.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.660
It actually makes a lot of sense.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.780
Every birthday, the office gets a cake, snacks and a card.

11:04.740 --> 11:05.700
The awesome.

11:06.420 --> 11:07.940
Yeah, that sounds pretty good.

11:07.940 --> 11:09.540
I dread these cards.

11:09.540 --> 11:11.700
What are you even supposed to write on these things?

11:11.700 --> 11:15.460
At a certain point, how many ways can you write happy birthday, blah, blah, blah.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.380
Do you have any creative things I can write?

11:17.380 --> 11:21.220
Should I have a specific thing I write every time or come up with personal things every

11:21.220 --> 11:21.780
time?

11:21.780 --> 11:23.060
I need your help.

11:23.060 --> 11:26.100
Another year older, no years wiser in Washington, DC.

11:26.100 --> 11:26.580
Sign it.

11:27.140 --> 11:28.340
Tom Hanks.

11:28.340 --> 11:32.180
Because in 20 years, they'll look at that card and think, wait a minute.

11:32.980 --> 11:35.060
Did Tom Hanks come to my birthday?

11:35.060 --> 11:35.460
But put an H.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.740
And they won't remember.

11:36.740 --> 11:38.020
Put an H in Tom.

11:41.060 --> 11:45.780
I think that that they'll probably know that that's not the real Tom Hanks.

11:45.780 --> 11:50.500
Well, maybe or maybe when he's in public, he doesn't want the paparazzo chasing him

11:50.500 --> 11:50.980
around.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.780
What's up with you and Rhea Perlman?

11:53.780 --> 11:54.420
Is that who he was?

11:58.260 --> 12:01.700
You know, what do we get Joe for Volcano too, Tom?

12:01.700 --> 12:03.460
What are you dropping it on us?

12:03.460 --> 12:05.860
Don't touch the tough questions, Tom.

12:05.860 --> 12:09.300
Tom, elaborate your relationship with Rhea Perlman.

12:09.860 --> 12:14.260
I remember working in an office and like having the same fear and like sending thank

12:14.260 --> 12:15.060
you notes and how many.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.140
But here's the thing, question asker.

12:18.340 --> 12:23.380
There is not a world in which people are comparing their birthday cards and going what

12:23.380 --> 12:24.420
they write in yours.

12:24.980 --> 12:26.020
Like that's not a fit.

12:26.020 --> 12:27.300
Like you don't have to.

12:27.300 --> 12:30.500
You can write every time like, hey, happy birthday.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.860
It's great working with you.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.940
Signed your name on every card.

12:33.940 --> 12:35.940
And they're not going to be like, oh, did he write that again?

12:35.940 --> 12:37.700
Wrote the same thing in mine.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.300
Like nobody cares.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.700
The one thing I always feel weird about in cards like that is just putting my John Hancock

12:43.700 --> 12:46.980
on there because I feel like that's sort of saying like, you're welcome.

12:46.980 --> 12:52.020
You know, like here, I just increased the value of your card because I too looked at

12:52.020 --> 12:53.540
this card and signed it.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.740
I put my name right there.

12:54.740 --> 12:55.780
This gets my approval.

12:55.780 --> 12:57.060
Yeah, this is card.

12:57.620 --> 12:58.820
I'm going to sign off on this.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.660
The best thing to do is right on the fold.

13:02.660 --> 13:05.780
Just write, I signed your crack and then put your name.

13:05.780 --> 13:06.820
It's fun.

13:06.820 --> 13:07.380
It's funny.

13:07.380 --> 13:08.260
That's good.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.940
Everybody loves it every time.

13:09.940 --> 13:16.340
You could write in there, did you know Martin?

13:16.340 --> 13:18.260
If it's Martin, whose birthday you're celebrating.

13:18.260 --> 13:21.780
Hey Martin, it's me, Siobhan.

13:21.780 --> 13:26.820
Did you know that Rhea Perlman was married to Danny DeVito and not Tom Hanks?

13:27.620 --> 13:29.860
That was Rita Wilson.

13:31.140 --> 13:34.420
Just a little Snopes fact for you and then sign it Snopes.

13:34.420 --> 13:43.220
If maybe one thing you could do is wait until the very last person other than you has signed

13:43.220 --> 13:49.940
the card and then once everyone has signed, you take the card and right at the very top

13:49.940 --> 13:55.300
of it, we the undersigned certify that Greg is the chillest dude in the office and has

13:56.180 --> 14:03.220
the best taste in music and always like brings the best snacks and is the best at bar trivia.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.780
And then you can present that to people.

14:05.780 --> 14:08.980
You can need to steal this birthday card, but you can present that to people and say,

14:08.980 --> 14:11.060
listen, this is an official legal document.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.500
This has been notarized.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.380
Sorry, in this circumstance, are you Greg or is the card for Greg?

14:15.380 --> 14:17.860
You're Greg and somebody else's birthday card.

14:17.860 --> 14:18.980
I don't care who, it doesn't matter.

14:19.940 --> 14:23.540
As long as we're having fun with legal documents, you could just write at the top above all

14:23.540 --> 14:28.260
their signatures, the words asshole list and then a colon.

14:28.260 --> 14:33.140
And then it's like, why would it, why would any of these people sign willingly put themselves

14:33.140 --> 14:34.420
on the asshole list?

14:34.420 --> 14:36.660
You would, you, that would, that could be your signature.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.580
You're creating an opening for yourself.

14:38.580 --> 14:40.900
You say, I don't know why everybody just write on the card.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.620
I don't know why everybody else signed this, but I can't in good conscience put my name

14:43.620 --> 14:43.940
on here.

14:43.940 --> 14:46.500
I don't think I'm an asshole.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.540
Have a great birthday.

14:47.540 --> 14:48.900
I don't consider myself an asshole.

14:51.860 --> 14:55.700
Or you could write something sweet like your name doesn't belong on this list because you're

14:55.700 --> 14:56.420
not an asshole.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.380
Have a great birthday.

14:57.380 --> 14:57.940
Stay cool.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.220
Have a great summer.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.740
Love, David.

15:01.380 --> 15:02.180
Love, David.

15:02.180 --> 15:02.660
Oh shit.

15:02.660 --> 15:03.780
I put my name on here.

15:03.780 --> 15:04.580
Technically.

15:04.580 --> 15:05.380
Ah, man.

15:05.940 --> 15:07.220
Ah, man.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.260
With like 60 A's.

15:08.980 --> 15:11.060
Could you draw a cute picture of them?

15:11.060 --> 15:17.220
Could you maybe get great at the art of caricature and then draw a fun picture of everybody whose

15:17.220 --> 15:17.780
birthday it is?

15:17.780 --> 15:19.300
Maybe add some value to this card.

15:20.340 --> 15:23.060
Maybe just give them your own card like that.

15:23.060 --> 15:24.020
Nobody else signed.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.260
So you don't sign that one that everybody signed.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.580
And they get a second card from you.

15:28.580 --> 15:32.100
Travis fucking power play.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.860
Count how many people you work with.

15:33.860 --> 15:38.820
Go to Target or wherever people buy cards and buy that many cards.

15:38.820 --> 15:44.340
And then say like, hey, I just wanted you to know that like I didn't want to like lump

15:44.340 --> 15:48.260
in my feelings, which are so complex with everybody else's feelings.

15:48.260 --> 15:49.380
So I got you my own card.

15:49.380 --> 15:52.580
And then what's great is that that card will have a message in it already.

15:52.580 --> 15:53.220
That's yours.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.100
You own that message.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.100
You don't have to write anything else extra.

15:56.100 --> 15:56.660
You give it to them.

15:56.660 --> 15:59.460
That's going to piss everybody else off until it's their birthday.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.500
And they get that special treatment, that double card treatment.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.460
Can you just find something important in this scenario?

16:05.460 --> 16:09.380
You must not allow anyone else to sign your card.

16:09.380 --> 16:11.780
So if they're like, hey, we forgot to get Steve a card.

16:11.780 --> 16:13.300
Can we all just sign yours?

16:13.300 --> 16:14.660
Because we know you're the card guy.

16:14.660 --> 16:16.420
Like, no, no.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.740
If they do just write asshole list above their name.

16:21.620 --> 16:21.860
Done.

16:21.860 --> 16:27.540
Done, everybody has something in their wallet that they'd like to unload, but they worry

16:27.540 --> 16:28.820
that they might need it someday.

16:28.820 --> 16:31.060
And this seems like a perfect opportunity.

16:31.060 --> 16:35.700
Whenever this list, this card thing comes around, just slide them like, you know, your

16:35.700 --> 16:39.940
pita pit punch card in there with a little notes like, hey, three more punches on this

16:39.940 --> 16:41.940
bad boy and you're off to pita town.

16:41.940 --> 16:42.580
No problem.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.900
No problem at all.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.260
Get something at the library.

16:46.260 --> 16:46.820
My treat.

16:47.860 --> 16:48.980
This is my library card.

16:48.980 --> 16:53.540
Also, you owe them $6.75 in late fees.

16:53.540 --> 16:54.500
Pay my late fees.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.220
Happy birthday.

16:56.260 --> 16:57.620
Do you guys want Yahoo?

16:59.460 --> 17:00.820
I didn't get an affirmative word.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.820
That was like the first time you said nothing.

17:02.820 --> 17:04.180
I was scootching around a little bit.

17:04.180 --> 17:11.460
My Chrome tabs are just a network of me trying to figure out in real time who the fuck Rhea

17:11.460 --> 17:13.860
Pearlman is and how I possessed that name.

17:14.980 --> 17:17.140
I think that gets you on some kind of watch list.

17:17.140 --> 17:18.660
I don't think so.

17:18.660 --> 17:21.940
I think next time I get on Netflix, it's going to be like, we heard you're interested in

17:21.940 --> 17:22.900
Rhea Pearlman.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.140
Here's a fuck ton of cheers.

17:25.140 --> 17:28.660
It gets you on Rhea Pearlman's personal Google alerts.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.220
Hey, I heard you were craving my waves.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.740
You got any work for me?

17:32.740 --> 17:33.780
Check this shit out.

17:33.780 --> 17:34.820
Matilda 2.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.300
It's not a thing, but it could be.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.100
Patreon me.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.940
Matilda's mom stars in Matilda 2.

17:43.940 --> 17:47.780
Matilda 2, the story you really wanted to follow for that.

17:47.780 --> 17:48.660
Forget about Miss Honey.

17:48.660 --> 17:50.580
Forget about that magic little tyke.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.020
You got Matilda's mom.

17:52.020 --> 17:53.140
No, I got her back.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.700
I got you back, didn't I, Matilda?

17:57.060 --> 17:59.300
Somebody stole my child.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.380
How do I not have the audience's sympathy?

18:01.380 --> 18:02.740
My child's been abducted.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.420
How about this Yahoo?

18:06.420 --> 18:09.780
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

18:09.780 --> 18:10.980
Yeah, Drew, Drew Davenport.

18:10.980 --> 18:11.460
Thank you, Drew.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user David, who asks,

18:17.780 --> 18:20.500
can a teenager have a personal bodyguard

18:20.500 --> 18:21.940
for a short amount of time?

18:22.980 --> 18:26.820
If so, what website can I go to sign up for this?

18:27.780 --> 18:29.060
Prices would be nice.

18:30.660 --> 18:32.980
This person's asking us to do a lot of legwork, huh?

18:36.100 --> 18:37.540
OK, gut reaction.

18:37.540 --> 18:39.380
Bodyguards have to be expensive,

18:39.380 --> 18:41.380
or else everyone would have one, right?

18:43.380 --> 18:45.540
Like, it feels like a thing that everyone would want

18:45.540 --> 18:46.820
if it were cost-effective.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.300
I feel like everyone, a lot of people,

18:49.300 --> 18:50.100
I shouldn't say everyone,

18:50.100 --> 18:53.380
because I wouldn't count myself in this assembly,

18:53.380 --> 18:55.140
but I feel like a lot of folks saw

18:55.700 --> 18:57.300
the comedy classic, Trillbit Taylor,

18:59.940 --> 19:01.860
and they saw that and they thought,

19:01.860 --> 19:02.900
hey, that would be nice.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.540
But if you think about it, that movie was,

19:05.540 --> 19:07.860
and I saw a little bit of it on a plane,

19:07.860 --> 19:11.140
that movie was a lot about an adult Owen Wilson

19:11.140 --> 19:13.860
going around and beating the shit out of little kids.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.340
And they don't let you do that so much.

19:17.060 --> 19:18.820
No, not legally, no.

19:18.820 --> 19:20.420
They let you do it once,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.340
and then after that they pretty much put a stop to it.

19:22.340 --> 19:24.740
The principal will go up to Owen Wilson and be like,

19:25.300 --> 19:28.580
Owen, you need to stop, because they're children.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.020
Owen, you're punching children.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.660
And he's like, yeah, I punched a kid.

19:32.660 --> 19:34.580
That was the worst thing I've ever seen.

19:34.580 --> 19:35.940
That was the worst.

19:35.940 --> 19:42.500
And he'll explain to them,

19:42.500 --> 19:44.420
no, you see, I'm a professional.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.100
I'm a professional body.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.500
When you tell the principal of the school

19:48.500 --> 19:50.980
that you're terrorizing, that you're a professional.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.340
I'll leave your school for $1 million.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.460
You know, there was never a scene in First Kid

19:57.460 --> 20:00.020
where Sinbad beat up a bunch of kids.

20:00.020 --> 20:01.700
At least I don't remember that happening.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.220
But in that movie, Sinbad can't explain to a principal

20:05.220 --> 20:08.340
or other adult, no, you see, I'm a paid professional.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.580
That doesn't get them off your case.

20:12.580 --> 20:15.220
You're still beating up a bunch of kids, Owen Wilson.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.580
In every movie where somebody has a bodyguard,

20:20.580 --> 20:23.300
especially if it's the president's teenage daughter,

20:24.420 --> 20:28.260
there is inevitably a scene where the daughter

20:28.260 --> 20:30.580
pulls some shenanigans or hijinks

20:30.580 --> 20:32.340
and manages to shake her bodyguard

20:32.340 --> 20:33.380
and get out there on the town.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.260
Or at least that's the way it always happened in West Wing.

20:36.260 --> 20:41.060
That is a freedom that I will never know.

20:41.060 --> 20:44.340
I'll never know the suffocation

20:44.340 --> 20:46.260
of having personal protection

20:46.260 --> 20:48.420
and just like the ensuing freedom

20:48.420 --> 20:50.820
when I managed to lose that protection

20:50.820 --> 20:52.980
down like a blind alley or something like that.

20:52.980 --> 20:55.620
Like I'll never be able to experience that

20:55.620 --> 20:56.900
without laying out some cash.

20:56.900 --> 21:00.580
It bothers me though that in movies like that,

21:00.580 --> 21:01.860
when that scenario happens,

21:01.860 --> 21:04.980
that the next scene isn't the bodyguard's boss

21:04.980 --> 21:06.660
being like, what the fuck?

21:06.660 --> 21:08.820
She's 16 and you lost her?

21:08.820 --> 21:11.700
You're the worst secret agent at like,

21:11.700 --> 21:13.300
why are we paying you?

21:13.300 --> 21:16.580
You got outsmarted by like a 12 year old kid.

21:16.580 --> 21:18.260
You're the worst.

21:18.260 --> 21:18.740
You're really bad.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.660
Like how are you supposed to stop Osama?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.620
Justin, I do wanna point out that

21:23.620 --> 21:27.220
I know that sometimes you slip off that ankle monitor

21:27.220 --> 21:30.260
that I gave you and you go eat some point-free cookies.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.540
Some cookies that you did not exchange

21:33.540 --> 21:35.940
a fair amount of cookie points for.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.460
You didn't earn those cookie points

21:39.460 --> 21:41.700
by eating cucumbers or whatnot.

21:42.820 --> 21:45.460
And I think that you should get a similar thrill

21:45.460 --> 21:47.460
for tricking me in that way.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.780
That is a great point, Griffin.

21:49.780 --> 21:51.300
If I'm gonna hire a bodyguard,

21:51.300 --> 21:54.420
I need to hire a bodyguard from the most clear

21:54.420 --> 21:57.620
and present danger to my body, and that is me.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.020
I need someone to literally guard my body

22:00.020 --> 22:06.580
from my various advances and hurtful attacks

22:06.580 --> 22:08.820
that I launch against my body on a regular basis.

22:10.820 --> 22:13.380
Yeah, and for me, that would just be sloth, I think.

22:13.940 --> 22:15.940
Just like, hey, get up and do something.

22:15.940 --> 22:16.580
Like, nope.

22:16.580 --> 22:20.340
Ha-ha, I'm free of you at last, body-bodyguard.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.460
Can you imagine Griffin just going full

22:24.820 --> 22:26.580
dead man's float, cordwood,

22:27.140 --> 22:30.420
trying to force a bodyguard to pick him up off the floor?

22:30.420 --> 22:31.060
That's hard.

22:32.100 --> 22:36.260
It's a lot of weight to try to just get up from a dead lift.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.500
Did the kid in blank check hire a bodyguard?

22:39.540 --> 22:40.980
No, he hired a driver.

22:40.980 --> 22:43.540
I think maybe fought some guys for him.

22:43.540 --> 22:46.740
But I don't think he hired a trained hit man

22:46.740 --> 22:47.460
or something like that.

22:48.340 --> 22:49.620
That is a good question, right?

22:50.420 --> 22:52.740
Your blank check, you have a million dollars,

22:52.740 --> 22:55.700
maybe $500 after you bought all your house

22:55.700 --> 22:57.220
in your various accoutrement.

22:57.220 --> 22:58.980
You realize that the mob is after you

22:58.980 --> 23:00.180
to get the money back, right?

23:00.820 --> 23:03.940
Wouldn't the most obvious course of action

23:03.940 --> 23:09.540
be to hire a professional to remedy the situation for you

23:09.540 --> 23:11.060
for one-tenth of the money?

23:11.060 --> 23:14.740
Listen, I have a million dollars, I will cut you $100,000.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.620
The only thing you have to do is find anybody

23:17.620 --> 23:19.300
who knows anything about this money

23:19.300 --> 23:21.540
and wipe them off the face of the earth.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.220
Eliminate them.

23:23.220 --> 23:24.820
Bring me the head of Tone Loc.

23:27.620 --> 23:28.740
I would watch that movie.

23:30.260 --> 23:31.220
How am I supposed to sleep at night

23:31.220 --> 23:34.100
knowing Tone Loc is out there hungry for my kid blood?

23:34.100 --> 23:34.600
And why?

23:35.540 --> 23:36.260
And why?

23:36.260 --> 23:37.460
For a million?

23:37.460 --> 23:38.100
That's it?

23:38.100 --> 23:41.540
Tone Loc is also very loosely associated with this whole thing.

23:41.540 --> 23:42.660
How much money would I have to pay you

23:42.660 --> 23:43.700
to murder Tone Loc?

23:43.700 --> 23:44.740
Two million dollars?

23:44.740 --> 23:46.900
Fine, I'll find the other million somewhere.

23:46.900 --> 23:47.860
I'll pinch pennies.

23:49.140 --> 23:50.420
Also, I want to remind you guys

23:50.420 --> 23:52.100
that Tone Loc in this scenario

23:52.100 --> 23:53.940
was just supposed to be the pickup man.

23:53.940 --> 23:55.300
Like, it's not his money.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.100
He's very loosely associated with the blank check scenario.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.980
And yet he is on board with murdering this child

24:00.980 --> 24:02.580
from the jump where he's just like,

24:02.580 --> 24:03.620
I'm here to pick up the money.

24:03.620 --> 24:04.980
And they're like, I already gave it to someone.

24:04.980 --> 24:07.700
And he's like, all right, well, I guess I gotta kill that kid.

24:07.700 --> 24:08.580
Tone Loc?

24:08.580 --> 24:09.940
It took no convincing.

24:09.940 --> 24:10.980
I guess I'll kill that kid.

24:10.980 --> 24:11.540
Like, why?

24:12.580 --> 24:13.220
What?

24:13.220 --> 24:14.260
What are you talking about?

24:14.260 --> 24:16.580
That's so far removed from the solution that we...

24:16.580 --> 24:21.940
Guys, I'm a staunch detractor from the death penalty.

24:21.940 --> 24:24.420
I don't support it in any circumstance,

24:24.420 --> 24:25.380
except for this one.

24:26.740 --> 24:27.940
Just let Tone Loc fry.

24:28.900 --> 24:29.620
He's a monster.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.300
He's out there terrorizing kids.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.860
He's gone Tone Loco.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.780
And there's no coming back from that.

24:35.780 --> 24:36.580
We all agree.

24:36.580 --> 24:40.100
Tone Loc showed up at Mr. Wilson's house.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.820
Like, hey, if Dennis is being too much of a menace for you,

24:43.380 --> 24:44.260
I can eliminate him.

24:44.260 --> 24:47.540
Like, that's absolutely not what I would want Tone Loc at all.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.380
Like, he is a menace.

24:49.380 --> 24:53.060
But that just means like sometimes he messes up my azalea bushes.

24:53.060 --> 24:54.900
Like, I don't want him killed.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.100
What are you talking about?

24:56.100 --> 24:56.500
Let me see.

24:56.500 --> 24:56.980
Let me see.

24:56.980 --> 24:59.700
Oh my God, it looks like he's destroyed your ship in a bottle.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.740
I'll fucking teach him something about death.

25:02.740 --> 25:03.780
Tone Loc?

25:03.780 --> 25:04.280
What?

25:04.280 --> 25:09.000
Hey, Papa Dinosaur, are you tired of the baby dinosaur telling you that you're not the mama?

25:09.000 --> 25:13.640
Well, I might have a person who could slip a little something into his Gerbers,

25:13.640 --> 25:14.520
if you know what I mean.

25:14.520 --> 25:24.280
Are you talking about killing my baby dinosaur by poisoning his Gerbers prehistoric rat puree?

25:24.280 --> 25:27.320
Hey, Hulk Hogan, how would you like it there to be zero ninjas?

25:31.320 --> 25:33.240
Well, Tone Loc, I don't think I'd like that very much.

25:33.240 --> 25:37.960
I have an image to uphold that I'm going to spend the next decade dismantling brick by brick,

25:37.960 --> 25:39.880
and I don't want to do it all at once, okay?

25:39.880 --> 25:42.040
I need a little runaway, my dude.

25:42.760 --> 25:43.400
Oh, man.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.880
Tone Loc, cut it out.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.720
Stop killing kids, Tone Loc.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.280
Stop it.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.720
Read another question.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.600
Hey, you know sometimes people tag people on Twitter?

25:54.600 --> 25:57.240
No, don't, please don't.

25:57.240 --> 26:00.360
Please don't tag Tone Loc and say, hey, there's a great dis-

26:00.360 --> 26:03.560
People did that, we talked about killing Tom Baudette a lot on our other show,

26:03.560 --> 26:08.280
The Adventure Zone, and a lot of people were like, Tommy, you gotta check this dude out.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.680
Listen, how much these guys talk about killing you.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.240
You're gonna love it.

26:13.240 --> 26:17.240
Now, I mean, no press is bad press, I guess, but this does not apply.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.240
Here we have another question.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.720
I'm looking for some social awareness advice here.

26:21.720 --> 26:25.960
No one likes a spoiler, but at some point they lose their potency.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.760
Clearly, I'm not going to discuss the happenings of the Nick the day after it

26:28.760 --> 26:32.120
airs loudly in a group of people, but if they don't know Bruce Willis,

26:33.880 --> 26:36.680
I can't finish the sentence, but there's a sixth sense spoiler here,

26:37.400 --> 26:38.520
then they have missed the boat.

26:39.560 --> 26:44.600
What is the timeframe in which a spoiler transitions to socially acceptable conversation fodder?

26:44.600 --> 26:47.320
That's from Spoiler Free in Sydney.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.960
As somebody who dropped a Firefly spoiler on our other podcast,

26:51.960 --> 26:55.800
The Adventure Zone thinking, hey, that movie came out like nine fucking years ago.

26:55.800 --> 27:01.240
Uh, longer than nine years, because I got an earful from a lot of folks.

27:01.240 --> 27:06.360
Well, that's the thing is, this is, it's all context, because if you look at someone,

27:06.360 --> 27:10.840
like if you're having a conversation about sixth sense and the person says,

27:10.840 --> 27:16.360
oh, I've never seen it, then like that, then, then is too early.

27:16.360 --> 27:20.520
Like if they're like, yeah, I saw it, or they're like, I'm never going to see it.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.080
So what, we're just never supposed to talk about,

27:23.080 --> 27:27.480
we're never supposed to talk about the fact that, you know,

27:27.480 --> 27:33.960
Bruce Willis was a reincarnated horse the whole time, like to anybody,

27:33.960 --> 27:36.200
just because one person on earth hasn't seen it.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.360
When can you casually blurt things out?

27:39.560 --> 27:42.360
And I think that there has to be,

27:42.360 --> 27:46.680
so probably different rules have to apply to television shows and movies,

27:46.680 --> 27:48.760
because if you really cared about a movie,

27:48.760 --> 27:52.440
like just clear your schedule for two hours and like watch it.

27:52.440 --> 27:57.480
But there's spoilers in TV shows where it's going to take you some seasons of like,

27:58.600 --> 28:00.440
the OC is a perfect example, right?

28:01.320 --> 28:06.920
I'm not going to spoil the end of the third season of the OC for you,

28:06.920 --> 28:08.840
because it's going to take you a long time to get there.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.240
And I've worked so hard just to get you to check it out,

28:11.240 --> 28:16.120
because it's really, really, really a fucking amazing program.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.240
Let's change the subject.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.360
There's no answer to this.

28:18.360 --> 28:23.240
I mean, you just got to be as cautious as possible in polite company, I think.

28:24.360 --> 28:28.360
And also, like, please, if you've had five years to watch,

28:28.360 --> 28:30.680
I think the better answer is this.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.720
If you've had like years upon years to watch something,

28:34.360 --> 28:38.280
don't get butt hurt when you find out what happened on the thing.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.680
I'm about a year behind Game of Thrones.

28:40.680 --> 28:45.160
I'm a fairly good sketch of what happens in the season of Game of Thrones

28:45.160 --> 28:46.840
that I keep putting off watching.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.920
I can't get mad about that.

28:48.920 --> 28:49.880
I should have watched it.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.160
Yeah, if you really wanted to see it, you'd see it.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.200
Just go see it.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.360
It clearly didn't matter that much to you.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.240
We actually, we got another question about spoilers this week,

28:59.240 --> 29:01.240
and so we'll just lump these together.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.760
And the question was, hey brothers,

29:02.760 --> 29:04.760
sometimes I go out to see a movie with my friends

29:04.760 --> 29:07.000
and we take a cab or Uber home.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.360
What's the policy on talking about the movie in a cab or Uber?

29:10.360 --> 29:13.000
Should we worry about spoiling the movie for the driver?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.840
And that's for blabbing in the Big Apple.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.920
That's a meaty question.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.920
That's a savory meatball right there.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.720
I just want to pop that in my mouth and just work it over.

29:22.440 --> 29:23.960
Damn, that's a good question.

29:24.600 --> 29:28.520
You need to agree on a code before you get in the car.

29:30.920 --> 29:35.320
By which I mean, if you go to see, let's say, Night of the Roxbury II,

29:36.120 --> 29:40.200
the Will Ferrell character whose name, of course, is Roxy,

29:40.840 --> 29:43.400
and the Chris Kattan character whose name is Barry,

29:43.400 --> 29:45.320
don't refer to them by those character names.

29:45.320 --> 29:51.000
So you want to create new ones like Little Nick or Tom Bombadil.

29:51.000 --> 29:51.640
Or Fat Hog.

29:51.640 --> 29:55.880
And you would just, Fat Hog and Tom Bombadil,

29:56.680 --> 29:58.520
and talk about their adventures that way.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.960
The driver will have no idea what you're talking about.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.240
Though you may want to consult the driver

30:05.240 --> 30:07.160
because maybe this is how they watch movies.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.160
Maybe they don't go to the theater

30:09.160 --> 30:13.800
because they just get sort of the second hand movies.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.400
No, no, please go on.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.760
Did you see the new Star Wars?

30:16.760 --> 30:20.440
Yeah, dude, I saw it like 17 times at this point.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.240
I loved it.

30:21.240 --> 30:27.880
I loved it when Blart Vader went in and he fought a bunch of guys

30:27.880 --> 30:29.960
and then he farted in my car.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.800
It's terrible.

30:32.680 --> 30:37.320
I really liked the part where Princess Leia kissed Han on the mouth

30:37.320 --> 30:39.640
and it was like that sweet music played.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.920
And then someone spilled like half of a Sprite in my back seat

30:43.560 --> 30:45.160
of my car that I own.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.640
That's like my car and my super sticky seat.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.720
And I really liked that part of the movie.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.200
Would you agree that there's a huge difference

30:56.200 --> 30:59.400
between doing this in an Uber or Lyft versus a cab?

30:59.400 --> 31:02.680
There's something about it that seems like in a cab,

31:02.680 --> 31:03.800
I wouldn't worry about it.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.880
I would just have the conversation.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.800
But in Lyft and Uber, I'd be like,

31:07.800 --> 31:09.960
now this person is basically my buddy at this point.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.800
They did pick me up from my house

31:11.800 --> 31:14.200
and I'm sitting in their Toyota Corolla

31:14.200 --> 31:17.960
and listening to their CD of bird sounds.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.640
I'm not just going to talk about Zoolander 2 in front of them.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.200
I bet it's a pretty funny gag

31:24.200 --> 31:26.920
if you're going to get some dinner with your friend

31:26.920 --> 31:29.400
that's an Uber driver if you get in the back seat.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.640
I bet they probably get a big kick out of that.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.200
Hey, just drive me wherever.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.200
I just need to be on the streets.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.000
I say, once you get into the Uber,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.520
say, all right, Derek or whatever their name is.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.040
You know their name because it's on the app.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.960
So like, hey, Derek, my name's Griffin.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.080
What are you into?

31:47.080 --> 31:48.920
And maybe they'll be like, I don't know.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.120
I'm looking forward to getting home

31:50.120 --> 31:51.320
playing that new Call of Duty

31:51.320 --> 31:52.840
and being like, oh, cool, cool, cool.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.200
The dog dies or whatever.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.520
In the new Zoolander movie.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.760
What, you intentionally spoil it?

32:02.760 --> 32:03.480
Is that it?

32:03.480 --> 32:03.980
Yeah.

32:05.080 --> 32:05.720
Why?

32:05.720 --> 32:08.120
Because that's a shady business, isn't it?

32:08.120 --> 32:08.620
Uber.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.720
I maybe haven't been following the tech press

32:13.720 --> 32:15.560
as closely as maybe I should,

32:15.560 --> 32:18.440
but people don't like what they're doing, right?

32:18.440 --> 32:20.200
Right, right, right.

32:20.200 --> 32:23.400
Seems like they're rubbing some people the wrong way, maybe.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.000
They're doing a lot of bad business out there.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.880
Not to put too fine a point on it,

32:27.880 --> 32:28.920
but they're doing some stuff

32:28.920 --> 32:31.800
that I think a lot of people don't enjoy, I bet.

32:31.800 --> 32:35.320
I think I have an answer to both questions at the same time.

32:36.040 --> 32:36.540
Okay.

32:37.320 --> 32:40.040
If you spoil something for the Uber driver

32:40.760 --> 32:43.800
or the Lyft driver, you tip them extra.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.720
If you spoil something for a friend,

32:45.720 --> 32:47.800
you have to develop a sliding scale

32:47.800 --> 32:49.960
that's like the length of time the thing has been out

32:49.960 --> 32:52.360
and then you have to give them money for the spoiler.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.440
Travis, I love the idea of dollar value,

32:54.440 --> 32:57.320
but let me take the penalization one step further.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.880
If you spoil something for the Uber driver,

32:59.880 --> 33:02.280
then they get to ask you about movies

33:02.280 --> 33:03.800
you have and have not seen

33:03.800 --> 33:05.480
and wait till they find one that they have seen,

33:05.480 --> 33:07.960
you have not, and they get to spoil the ending for you.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.960
But that's a bad system because they could just be like,

33:11.960 --> 33:14.440
hey, have you watched, you talk about,

33:14.440 --> 33:15.640
oh, yeah, have you seen the new Star Wars?

33:15.640 --> 33:16.200
The dog dies.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.760
The guy's like, no, God, that, oh, okay.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.760
Well, tell me what, have you seen The Wire?

33:22.360 --> 33:26.280
Yes, I have seen The Wire.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.800
Because I haven't finished The Wire.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.960
I certainly don't want that one spoiled for me.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.400
And I just said that.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.240
Now, that's like my whole Twitter next week.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.400
But like, then I can just lie about it.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.480
But then I have to prove that I've seen it

33:39.480 --> 33:43.000
and they actually make you spoil it for them

33:43.000 --> 33:44.360
to make sure you're not lying.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.040
Have I taken it a layer too far?

33:48.040 --> 33:49.240
Like, have you seen The Wire?

33:49.880 --> 33:52.760
Yeah, okay, well, what happens to Greg?

33:52.760 --> 33:54.760
Greg gets shot.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.400
Damn, okay, you have seen The Wire.

33:57.400 --> 34:01.640
That is the ultimate fate of Greg, you got it.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.880
You don't have to worry too much, Griffin.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.400
Nobody's actually finished The Wire.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.160
Everybody's gotten two and a half seasons in and thought,

34:09.160 --> 34:11.160
oh, I just can't anymore.

34:11.720 --> 34:12.600
I just can't.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.480
Just like Dexter.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.920
Except after the first season in Dexter,

34:16.920 --> 34:19.400
they were like, and now season two of Dexter

34:19.400 --> 34:21.080
with nobody you've ever met before

34:21.080 --> 34:23.880
and a lot of it takes place on some boats.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.080
Like, cool, bye.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.880
Did you like those characters?

34:29.880 --> 34:31.880
Sure, yeah, I kind of liked those characters.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.320
What if none of them were there

34:33.320 --> 34:35.400
and you were just in an ugly shipping yard?

34:35.400 --> 34:36.840
I guess that would be okay.

34:37.480 --> 34:38.200
Let's try it.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.480
No, not for me.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.760
Oh, I don't like it.

34:40.760 --> 34:41.640
Let's go to the money zone.

34:41.640 --> 34:42.760
Too many crates.

34:42.760 --> 34:56.920
My brother, My Brother, Me is supported in part by harrys.com.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.120
Hey, you guys do Movember?

34:58.840 --> 35:00.760
Anybody on this call can go visual hair Travis?

35:00.760 --> 35:01.640
I do Mo Life.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.160
Mo Life.

35:03.160 --> 35:07.400
And then I just dedicate, I donate money to everybody.

35:07.400 --> 35:12.600
I'm doing Mo Rocca, by which I mean Mo Rocca and I.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.360
You're dating Mo Rocca.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.640
I'm dating Mo Rocca.

35:15.640 --> 35:16.280
He's my boy.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.440
Hey guys, he's my boyfriend, okay?

35:19.480 --> 35:22.520
Harry's is the official partner of the Movember Foundation

35:22.520 --> 35:24.120
and also the Mo Rocca Foundation.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.680
Which is just mine and Mo Rocca's relationship.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.360
I'm very supportive of his endeavors.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.640
I love his stuff on CBS Sunday morning and Monday morning.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.840
Every day of the week.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.840
Every day of the week is Mo Rocca day for me, baby.

35:35.720 --> 35:36.520
I like my mother.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.560
I just donated $25 to protect Mo Rocca

35:39.560 --> 35:42.120
because there's only one Mo Rocca left on earth.

35:42.120 --> 35:42.680
Did you guys know that?

35:42.680 --> 35:43.640
You're kidding me.

35:43.640 --> 35:44.760
Yeah, there's only one.

35:44.760 --> 35:45.000
Huh?

35:45.640 --> 35:49.080
Yeah, so we have to put him into like a reserve.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.760
He's gonna need to protect him.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.640
You won't need to see, you won't get to see him anymore.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.400
We have to protect him from you.

35:55.400 --> 35:58.520
At least until we can find another Mo Rocca to mate him with.

35:58.520 --> 36:03.480
And then it'll be, okay, so Harry's makes razors

36:03.480 --> 36:05.960
and they're donating money to help raise awareness

36:05.960 --> 36:08.280
for men's health to the Movember Foundation.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.800
Harry's makes a really good quality razor

36:11.800 --> 36:13.720
and they got a starter set for 15 bucks.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.080
You're gonna get a razor,

36:15.080 --> 36:17.880
you're gonna get a foaming shave gel or shave cream

36:17.880 --> 36:21.000
and three razor blades plus free shipping.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.480
Now that seems expensive, I know.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.000
I mean, sorry, it seems cheap.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.360
It doesn't seem expensive.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.960
It seems like a very good value,

36:27.960 --> 36:29.480
but we can get you a better value.

36:30.120 --> 36:34.280
Go to harrys.com and get $5 off the starter set

36:34.280 --> 36:36.600
if you use the code, my brother, all one word.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.440
That's harrys.com for $5 off the starter set

36:40.440 --> 36:43.640
with the code, my brother, all one word.

36:43.640 --> 36:46.280
Start shaving better today.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.400
Can I tell you guys about Blue Apron?

36:49.400 --> 36:50.360
I wish you would.

36:50.360 --> 36:53.000
Okay, so Blue Apron has effectively

36:53.800 --> 36:57.080
changed the way Teresa and I do dinner.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.120
Same, same.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.440
We, yeah, like for a long,

37:00.440 --> 37:02.520
like we have always liked to cook

37:02.520 --> 37:07.160
and now we do Blue Apron like three nights a week.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.160
And the thing is, the beautiful thing about it is

37:09.160 --> 37:11.160
whether you already love to cook,

37:11.160 --> 37:17.400
this is just going to like suffuse your repertoire of meals.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.960
And if you are someone who's never cooked before,

37:19.960 --> 37:21.880
it comes with step-by-step instructions

37:21.880 --> 37:24.280
and all the ingredients you need to make the meal.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.680
So you don't have to like go out shopping,

37:26.680 --> 37:29.000
worry about what it means when it says this

37:29.000 --> 37:30.600
and how much of what do you need.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.200
It all comes there in a box

37:32.200 --> 37:34.440
and you make these amazing meals.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.760
And for Teresa and I, the two person options,

37:36.760 --> 37:39.240
it always leaves us with like leftovers

37:39.240 --> 37:41.000
that we eat over the next couple of days.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.880
And it's less than $10 a meal

37:43.880 --> 37:45.240
and it's full of fresh ingredients

37:45.240 --> 37:46.600
that are healthy for you.

37:46.600 --> 37:50.360
Each balanced meal is 500 to 700 calories per serving.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.960
So it's a really great deal.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.800
And coming up, they have some amazing,

37:53.800 --> 37:55.720
so like they've got stuff like

37:55.720 --> 37:59.000
harissa lamb and beef burgers with roasted carrot fries.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.640
Let's see, roasted sweet potato and caramelized onion pizza.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.400
Did you get that chicken cow soy soup?

38:05.400 --> 38:07.240
Did you get that with the yellow curry?

38:07.240 --> 38:09.080
Oh my God, that shit was amazing.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.120
How good was that?

38:10.680 --> 38:11.560
I also want to point out,

38:11.560 --> 38:12.840
they did a really cool thing this week

38:12.840 --> 38:14.120
where you can donate your meals.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.160
Instead of having them delivered,

38:15.160 --> 38:17.240
you could donate them to a food bank.

38:17.240 --> 38:21.000
They donated like 82,000 dinners for Thanksgiving for people,

38:21.000 --> 38:21.800
which I thought was really nice.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.360
That's nice.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.920
This is one of those things where like,

38:24.920 --> 38:26.920
we're telling you about a service we use.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.280
Sure, they're a sponsor of the show,

38:28.280 --> 38:29.400
they support the show,

38:29.400 --> 38:33.000
but like Teresa and I tell all our friends about it.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.360
You know, we're big fans.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.640
And here's the thing,

38:35.640 --> 38:36.680
right now I'm considering,

38:36.680 --> 38:38.360
like I'm telling my friends about it,

38:38.360 --> 38:40.280
the listeners of My Brother, My Brother and Me,

38:40.280 --> 38:44.520
because if you go to blueapron.com slash my brother,

38:44.520 --> 38:46.600
you will get your first two meals free

38:47.240 --> 38:48.440
and you'll get to check it out.

38:48.440 --> 38:51.000
Like it's, I promise you'll fall in love with it.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.760
And two free meals, it's a great deal.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.720
Go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.800
I got a message here and it's for Timmy.

38:58.360 --> 39:00.120
Timmy, you guys remember South Park

39:00.120 --> 39:03.560
and it's from your littlest niece, Maggie.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.560
I'll cut out the South Park thing.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.200
That was uncalled for.

39:08.200 --> 39:08.600
No, you have to live it.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.800
Don't you dare.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.480
I'm gonna keep mentioning your South.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.280
I'm gonna keep mentioning the South Park thing you said.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.800
So you can't edit it out.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.800
Oh my God, you killed Timmy.

39:17.800 --> 39:20.280
And it's from your littlest niece, Maggie.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.560
And Maggie says to Timmy,

39:22.120 --> 39:23.640
happy birthday, Uncle Timmy.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.360
You are the best uncle and godfather in the world.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.080
PS, I pooped in your pillowcase.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.080
Daddy said you like that kind of thing.

39:31.080 --> 39:35.640
So this is from a baby.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.280
I'm guessing that Maggie's daddy

39:38.280 --> 39:40.040
wrote this message to Timmy

39:40.040 --> 39:43.480
or else we're dealing with an adult teen baby situation.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.080
In which case I'm done.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.520
We could also be in a baby geniuses situation.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.320
That is a good point, Travis.

39:51.320 --> 39:52.200
Didn't even consider that.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.880
Or a baby stay out situation

39:53.880 --> 39:55.960
in which the baby crawled across the keyboard

39:55.960 --> 39:58.360
and miraculously, this is what came out.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.920
You know, if you let a million babies stay out,

40:00.920 --> 40:02.600
crawl across a million keyboards,

40:02.600 --> 40:04.280
eventually they would make Hamlet.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.000
Did you know that?

40:05.880 --> 40:08.600
Do you guys think if a million babies stay outs

40:08.600 --> 40:09.560
were all happening,

40:09.560 --> 40:13.320
the movie we saw was the one survivor?

40:16.360 --> 40:20.360
I think if you watch the other 999,999 baby day out,

40:20.360 --> 40:23.800
like one of them like falls off of the steel beam.

40:23.800 --> 40:24.440
And like dies.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.920
They did have the heart to call the movie

40:26.920 --> 40:27.960
its actual title,

40:27.960 --> 40:32.200
which is babies day out experiment 24AB397.

40:32.200 --> 40:32.680
Right.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.400
Because that was-

40:33.400 --> 40:35.320
That's actually what the movie theory of everything

40:35.320 --> 40:37.720
was about in which Stephen Hawking theorizes

40:37.720 --> 40:41.000
that out of the million different baby possibilities,

40:41.000 --> 40:42.840
baby geniuses or babies day out

40:42.840 --> 40:44.840
was the only one in which the baby lived.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.440
So a million babies.

40:46.440 --> 40:48.600
I'm saying like, fuck guys.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.800
I don't know, like 213 die getting out of the crib.

40:52.360 --> 40:55.880
And then like maybe only like 1400

40:55.880 --> 40:57.960
make it to the construction site.

40:58.520 --> 41:03.080
And then that proves to be a challenging crucible

41:03.080 --> 41:04.840
for those babies to try and survive.

41:04.840 --> 41:10.040
A lot of discussion of 90s kids flicks in this episode.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.240
Got another message here though.

41:12.200 --> 41:12.680
Please.

41:12.680 --> 41:13.320
Thank you.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.120
And it's for Ashley and it's from Tez,

41:16.920 --> 41:19.000
who just says space jam.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.360
The message just says space jam.

41:22.360 --> 41:25.400
And then underneath that it says smart house.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.440
So there it is.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.720
No, Tez says to Ashley,

41:29.720 --> 41:33.240
happy birthday to my podcast devouring Ryan Gosling

41:33.240 --> 41:36.840
driving a total bamf of a wife.

41:36.840 --> 41:38.440
Hope this message from the brothers

41:38.440 --> 41:40.280
puts a huge smile on your face.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.120
Lots of love from your husband.

41:43.160 --> 41:43.480
Tez.

41:43.480 --> 41:44.360
Tez.

41:44.360 --> 41:45.560
The Tez dispenser.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.680
Does she drive Ryan Gosling like a car?

41:50.520 --> 41:51.240
I think so.

41:51.240 --> 41:57.720
Because Ryan Gosling eats spicy food.

41:57.720 --> 41:58.760
We did it guys.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.600
We got our eight turbotin reference.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.400
Confetti just shot out of all the lights and rails.

42:03.400 --> 42:07.320
We can finally die eight times in our podcast.

42:08.040 --> 42:11.080
We freed ourselves from this eternal podcast prison.

42:13.880 --> 42:15.960
I'm like a genie or a Beetlejuice.

42:17.320 --> 42:21.000
Let's re-reference turbotin eight times.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.320
That was the lock they put on my eternal prison.

42:25.320 --> 42:28.360
Those wizards that imprisoned me in this dark cage

42:28.360 --> 42:30.280
so many eons ago say like,

42:30.280 --> 42:32.680
well no one's going to talk about turbotin eight times.

42:33.800 --> 42:37.000
You know how on the 100 lives of Blackjack Savage

42:37.000 --> 42:40.280
he had to save a hundred people to save his soul?

42:40.280 --> 42:42.840
We had to mention turbotin eight times

42:42.840 --> 42:46.440
and the legend of the 100 lives of Blackjack Savage twice.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.920
So we have fulfilled both of those criteria.

42:48.920 --> 42:52.040
Now in a very, if I dare say, organic fashion.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.280
Hi, I'm Brian Safi.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.080
And I'm Erin Gibson.

42:55.080 --> 42:57.320
And we host the Throwing Shade podcast.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.560
On Throwing Shade we look at an issue important to ladies

42:59.560 --> 43:01.160
and an issue important to gay people

43:01.160 --> 43:02.600
and then we basically make fun of it.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.360
Yeah and just to answer your question,

43:04.360 --> 43:05.720
no we don't have a marriage pact.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.200
But if we don't get married by the time we're 30

43:08.200 --> 43:09.080
we're going to do that for each other.

43:09.080 --> 43:09.960
No, that's true.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.960
Although we have each been divorced three times.

43:11.960 --> 43:18.200
How about a Yahoo?

43:19.400 --> 43:25.160
Yeah, this Yahoo was sent in by Amanda Morhamy Aponte.

43:25.800 --> 43:26.920
I think I crushed that.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.480
Amanda, thank you.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

43:30.760 --> 43:32.120
Sorry something has gone wrong.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.080
Let's call them.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.600
Nope, sorry something's gone wrong.

43:34.600 --> 43:35.720
What the fuck guys?

43:36.760 --> 43:38.520
Yahoo fix your shit.

43:38.520 --> 43:42.680
Let's say their name is Morgus.

43:42.680 --> 43:44.280
Morgus, Morgus.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.160
Morgus.

43:45.160 --> 43:46.440
No, you're saying it wrong.

43:46.440 --> 43:47.000
Morgus.

43:48.280 --> 43:49.320
Morgus.

43:49.320 --> 43:50.040
That's better.

43:50.040 --> 43:55.160
Morgus asks, what would Quantum Leap have been like

43:55.160 --> 43:58.600
if Scott Bakula's character were played by a horse?

43:59.800 --> 44:02.280
I'm just wondering if you think the series would have been

44:02.280 --> 44:05.480
as well received if a horse had played Dr. Sam Beckett.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.160
How do you think it would have been different?

44:07.160 --> 44:10.840
What horse actor would you choose to replace Mr. Bakula?

44:10.840 --> 44:13.320
I said his name twice there in two different ways

44:13.320 --> 44:15.080
just to sort of hedge my bets.

44:15.080 --> 44:15.400
What?

44:16.040 --> 44:16.920
Read the question again.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.080
I can't even fucking parse it.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.360
Because it's so great?

44:20.360 --> 44:21.160
I agree.

44:21.160 --> 44:22.440
What would Quantum Leap have been like

44:22.440 --> 44:25.240
if Scott Bakula's character were played by a horse?

44:25.240 --> 44:28.840
Just wondering, what are you tripping up on?

44:28.840 --> 44:30.360
Which part of this are you tripping up on?

44:30.360 --> 44:32.200
Instead of the human Scott Bakula,

44:32.200 --> 44:33.160
we're dealing with a horse.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.880
A horse is Dr. Sam Beckett traveled back through time,

44:35.880 --> 44:37.720
but something went all wiry,

44:37.720 --> 44:40.920
and then he ended up in a baseball legend,

44:40.920 --> 44:42.680
and then he had to be the baseball legend.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.560
So he was a horse,

44:43.560 --> 44:45.640
but everybody else just sees the baseball legend.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.080
But it's a horse, so he can't pitch there.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.440
So he's a horse in a human body?

44:49.480 --> 44:50.040
Yes.

44:50.040 --> 44:52.680
I'm saying we're gonna have an episode

44:52.680 --> 44:54.360
that is gonna teach everyone,

44:54.360 --> 44:55.960
including Ian Griffin McElroy,

44:55.960 --> 44:57.560
about the difficulties that people went through

44:57.560 --> 44:59.320
during the civil rights struggle.

45:00.680 --> 45:04.520
But they'd be struggling even more with opening a door.

45:04.520 --> 45:06.680
Because horse hooves.

45:07.880 --> 45:09.000
Griffin, I think the thing

45:09.000 --> 45:10.920
that most trips me up about this question

45:10.920 --> 45:12.920
is the question, would it be as well received?

45:12.920 --> 45:14.120
Because basically what you're saying is,

45:14.120 --> 45:17.640
if I almost completely changed inherently-

45:17.640 --> 45:18.040
No.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.200
What could possibly happen in the show?

45:20.200 --> 45:20.840
Disagree.

45:20.840 --> 45:22.760
Are we, okay, okay.

45:22.760 --> 45:24.760
We're changing one thing,

45:24.760 --> 45:29.560
and that is the specie of Dr. Sam Beckett from human.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.480
We're gonna take that, we're gonna hit control F,

45:31.480 --> 45:35.080
find all human, replace with horse.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.520
Now, but here's my question, Griffin,

45:37.160 --> 45:38.920
is it a talking horse scenario?

45:38.920 --> 45:40.120
Is this a Mr. Ed,

45:40.120 --> 45:42.680
or is this just like a Black Beauty scenario

45:42.680 --> 45:44.600
where it's just a horse?

45:44.600 --> 45:45.320
Right.

45:45.320 --> 45:48.280
Am I gonna get a scene where like one aide

45:48.280 --> 45:50.040
confidentially whispers to another,

45:50.040 --> 45:52.200
why is President Kennedy eating oats?

45:52.200 --> 45:54.520
Like all the time, always eating oats.

45:55.080 --> 45:58.280
Sam, it seems like in order to get the leap this time,

45:58.280 --> 46:00.120
you're gonna have to be Elvis

46:00.120 --> 46:02.920
and perform at the Grand Ole Opry.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.040
Do you think you can handle that?

46:05.320 --> 46:06.040
Oh, shit.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.760
Probably not, it doesn't seem like.

46:08.760 --> 46:09.720
I think singing might be a little-

46:09.720 --> 46:11.080
Oh yeah, you don't know English.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.120
It doesn't seem like you are any language for that matter.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.320
I guess it's true what they say,

46:15.320 --> 46:16.600
you can lead a horse to water,

46:16.600 --> 46:17.800
but you can't make him leap.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.760
And then he would laugh, and then he would leap.

46:20.760 --> 46:21.880
The episodes would be very short.

46:21.880 --> 46:23.480
And then he would leap.

46:23.480 --> 46:31.320
What I think we can all agree on is that Al, you know, Al Kalivici.

46:32.040 --> 46:32.360
Yeah.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.400
Rear Admiral-

46:33.400 --> 46:35.560
Did you have to fucking Google his last name?

46:35.560 --> 46:37.800
Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Kalivici,

46:38.760 --> 46:42.440
while everyone else sees the person that has been leapt into,

46:42.440 --> 46:44.040
Al continues to see Sam Beckett.

46:44.040 --> 46:45.800
So by extension,

46:45.800 --> 46:48.680
Al would see a horse doing human things all the time.

46:48.680 --> 46:49.800
So basically what I'm saying is

46:50.440 --> 46:53.080
Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Kalivici

46:53.080 --> 46:56.840
would have the best job on Planet Earth.

46:56.840 --> 46:57.480
He would be telling you-

46:57.480 --> 46:59.240
I actually think it would be better received.

46:59.240 --> 47:02.120
Put in that context, the show would probably be better received.

47:02.120 --> 47:02.440
Yeah.

47:02.440 --> 47:04.120
Like, how's your job, Al?

47:04.120 --> 47:06.920
Yeah, it's actually like really good.

47:06.920 --> 47:10.840
What I do is I watch a horse pretend to do human things

47:10.840 --> 47:12.280
and everybody else tries to figure out

47:12.280 --> 47:14.360
why the human is acting like a horse.

47:14.360 --> 47:18.840
It's basically a delight, nine to five delight, constant delight.

47:19.560 --> 47:22.520
Was your client able to save Jacqueline Kennedy?

47:22.520 --> 47:27.160
No, but he did take a boob in the middle of the Oval Office.

47:27.160 --> 47:32.280
Let's use that specific Emmy Award-winning series of episodes

47:32.280 --> 47:35.560
where Dr. Sam Beckett hopped into Lee Harvey Oswald.

47:35.560 --> 47:38.840
Fucking, by the way, we joke about quantum-

47:38.840 --> 47:42.040
Listen, guys, we tell a lot of jokes about quantum leaf in this show.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.600
Go watch that series of episodes,

47:44.600 --> 47:47.000
because it's fucking stellar television.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.520
It's about as good as TV gets.

47:48.520 --> 47:53.320
Let's talk about, though, I think that that situation would have played out differently

47:53.880 --> 47:57.880
if Lee Harvey Oswald, instead of having an itchy trigger finger,

47:58.440 --> 48:00.200
had gunproof hooves.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.200
How is he supposed to do it?

48:02.200 --> 48:03.400
How is he supposed to do it?

48:03.400 --> 48:04.520
That's true.

48:05.320 --> 48:07.240
Maybe this explains the whole thing, right?

48:07.240 --> 48:08.520
There wasn't a third man.

48:08.520 --> 48:09.880
There was no shooter on the hill.

48:10.760 --> 48:14.280
What happened was he was just as fast as a very fast horse.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.760
Lee Harvey Oswald could run at very fast speeds

48:16.760 --> 48:19.080
and that enabled him to take all the shots himself.

48:19.960 --> 48:20.840
Of course.

48:20.840 --> 48:21.880
Didn't even think about that.

48:22.840 --> 48:26.360
I want to revise my previous statement, by the way.

48:26.360 --> 48:29.160
It would not be a great job because the novelty-

48:29.160 --> 48:36.120
Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Calvici would not have a very good job

48:36.120 --> 48:38.120
because in order for Sam Beckett to leap,

48:38.120 --> 48:40.760
he had to fulfill a certain set of criteria.

48:40.760 --> 48:45.000
I think we could all agree that a horse leapt into a human body

48:45.000 --> 48:52.920
would not be able to fulfill almost any of the criteria

48:52.920 --> 49:00.360
that Dr. Sam Beckett had to meet in every single episode in order to leap.

49:00.360 --> 49:08.360
What I'm offering is this, that it would permanently be a horse

49:08.360 --> 49:11.240
in the body of Tom Stratton, an Air Force test pilot

49:11.240 --> 49:12.840
about to attempt a dangerous flight.

49:12.840 --> 49:16.680
It would just be a horse trying to fly a plane forever

49:16.680 --> 49:19.640
and he wouldn't be able to, so it would just be Al like,

49:19.640 --> 49:20.920
Al, how's your job?

49:20.920 --> 49:22.840
Well, my job's pretty bad, actually.

49:22.840 --> 49:26.280
I have to watch a horse try to fly a plane every day.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.600
Over and over and over and over again.

49:28.600 --> 49:29.800
I'm stuck in some kind of purgatory state.

49:29.800 --> 49:33.560
What if he leapt regardless of whether he succeeded or failed?

49:33.560 --> 49:37.960
And so his job would just be watching as a horse freaks the fuck out

49:37.960 --> 49:42.040
while Patricia Richardson gets strangled in the back of a car

49:42.040 --> 49:43.080
or something like that.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.880
Actually, Patricia Richardson was in the series

49:45.880 --> 49:48.120
where they were in a radio station on strike

49:48.120 --> 49:50.840
and I don't think anybody was in mortal danger that episode,

49:50.840 --> 49:53.720
but so incompetent is this horse Beckett

49:53.720 --> 49:57.400
that Patricia Richardson would find a way to get stabbed to death

49:57.400 --> 49:59.240
by Chubby Checker or some shit.

49:59.240 --> 50:04.280
Griffin, you are the resident Quantum Leap expert.

50:04.280 --> 50:05.240
Let me ask you a quick question.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.640
My wife is a Quantum Leap expert.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.800
If I know anything about that show, I am.

50:09.800 --> 50:12.120
I have gained it through osmosis.

50:12.120 --> 50:17.480
Is there any backstory or explanation of where Al goes when he's not?

50:17.480 --> 50:20.840
Does he, because he's in his present time, right?

50:20.840 --> 50:21.320
Yeah.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.240
As a hologram talking to Sam.

50:23.240 --> 50:26.120
So he goes home and hangs out.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.920
So he's got, there would be scenes at a bar

50:28.920 --> 50:32.920
where he's talking to the bartender about that stupid fucking horse Beckett,

50:32.920 --> 50:36.040
again, not being able to figure out stairs, right?

50:36.040 --> 50:36.520
Yeah.

50:36.520 --> 50:39.000
That would definitely be a scene we would love to see.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.920
That would definitely be a scene we would see.

50:40.920 --> 50:42.440
And that bar is called Cheers.

50:42.440 --> 50:45.000
Do you remember that Happo Zone Cheers, right?

50:45.000 --> 50:47.800
Where fucking Al Calavichie just like walks in and everyone's like,

50:47.800 --> 50:48.600
Al!

50:48.600 --> 50:49.800
He's like, how's your job today?

50:49.800 --> 50:51.560
It's like pretty bad.

50:51.560 --> 50:56.040
I watched Patricia Richardson just get the life completely strangled out of her

50:56.040 --> 50:59.960
while a horse like did nothing.

50:59.960 --> 51:01.080
Hey, that's pretty crazy.

51:01.080 --> 51:04.280
That means none of those words mean anything to any of us.

51:04.280 --> 51:06.520
Yeah, I know.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.920
It's hard to find people to commiserate with me.

51:08.920 --> 51:10.120
I have a question for you.

51:11.800 --> 51:14.040
Quantum League is obviously a series that played with time travel.

51:15.080 --> 51:20.360
So there is no reason to think that Al's life would have to happen in parallel with it.

51:20.360 --> 51:22.840
What I'm saying is that he could queue up a bunch, right?

51:22.840 --> 51:26.920
Like he could just bang out a bunch of them in like an hour his time

51:26.920 --> 51:29.560
and just hop in where Sam, like a disc jockey,

51:29.560 --> 51:32.600
who's like prerecording his bits for a whole four hour shift.

51:32.600 --> 51:35.800
He could just bang out like three episodes worth in an afternoon.

51:35.800 --> 51:36.600
You know what?

51:36.600 --> 51:38.520
I'm going to revise my previous statement.

51:40.840 --> 51:44.200
Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Calvici has a great job.

51:44.200 --> 51:47.000
Because from like 9 to 1130,

51:47.000 --> 51:50.120
he has to watch a horse fuck up like three different things

51:50.120 --> 51:53.560
and then he gets to go home for the day and rebook and drink lemonade.

51:54.280 --> 51:57.160
And listen, at worst, he jumps back in to check on it

51:57.160 --> 51:59.000
and the horse is dead and he's free.

51:59.800 --> 52:00.920
He's free.

52:00.920 --> 52:03.000
Well, no, he would just leap into a different horse.

52:03.000 --> 52:10.360
Wait, but if the body that the anima of Dr. Sam Beckett was inhabiting died,

52:10.360 --> 52:12.360
did Dr. Sam Beckett not die?

52:12.360 --> 52:14.600
Was there like zero mortal risk for him?

52:14.600 --> 52:15.960
That's a tricky question, Travis.

52:15.960 --> 52:19.240
There is one episode where he's in a prisoner on death row

52:20.360 --> 52:26.440
and he gets put in the electric chair and he leaps while in the electric chair,

52:26.440 --> 52:33.480
which makes me think that death can move him on to the next puzzle to solve.

52:33.480 --> 52:36.040
Oh man, I wish they had played with that concept more.

52:37.560 --> 52:40.840
Yeah, I wish, by the way, that situation I just described,

52:40.840 --> 52:43.560
you heard that and you thought like, wow, what could they hop into next

52:43.560 --> 52:47.480
that would follow like the dramatic conclusion of an arc

52:47.480 --> 52:51.080
where he's in a prisoner on death row who gets executed?

52:51.080 --> 52:55.080
And then they followed that like heart wrenching drama up with like,

52:55.080 --> 52:58.440
oh no, you jumped into like a silly boy.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Oh no, you jumped into a clown.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.760
Oh no, it looks like I'm a woman again.

53:04.760 --> 53:06.040
How am I supposed to walk in high heels?

53:06.040 --> 53:09.800
Like, hi, you just died, Sam, Samuel.

53:12.040 --> 53:16.280
I have to revise my stance on Rear Admiral Al Calavichie

53:16.280 --> 53:21.720
because of the episode A Leap for Lisa, season four finale,

53:21.720 --> 53:26.680
Sam leaps into the body of Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Calavichie.

53:26.680 --> 53:29.960
Can you imagine Al Calavichie's day where he's like,

53:29.960 --> 53:33.400
he shows up to work and he's like, so what's on the agenda today?

53:33.400 --> 53:35.320
Oh well, there's good news and bad news.

53:35.320 --> 53:37.640
Actually, just bad news, a horse took your body

53:37.640 --> 53:39.960
and now a horse is in you forever.

53:39.960 --> 53:43.960
I think those would be the days where the other hologram guy,

53:43.960 --> 53:47.000
the really like ineffectual weird one,

53:47.000 --> 53:47.720
What are you talking about?

53:47.720 --> 53:51.960
Only jumped in for like three, there was another dude that like

53:51.960 --> 53:54.520
was there sometimes that wasn't Al.

53:54.520 --> 53:55.800
I don't think it was Ziggy.

53:56.840 --> 53:58.520
No, I'm not, there's another guy.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.440
I will be vindicated by the internet.

54:00.440 --> 54:04.280
I mean, there was an evil leaper who had their own Al,

54:04.280 --> 54:05.400
but it was a woman.

54:05.400 --> 54:08.200
There definitely wasn't another Al that they popped in

54:08.200 --> 54:10.840
when fucking Dean Stockwell was drunk

54:10.840 --> 54:12.920
and they couldn't get him on set.

54:12.920 --> 54:16.280
I am so right about this, but there's another guy,

54:16.280 --> 54:19.320
he's a little bit pudgy and I think he had like curly hair

54:20.120 --> 54:23.080
and he was sometimes there like filling in for Al

54:23.080 --> 54:24.520
when Al was busy.

54:24.520 --> 54:28.040
What are you talking about?

54:28.040 --> 54:32.520
That's absolutely real, I'm gonna Google it right now.

54:33.080 --> 54:35.080
Yeah, Google fat Al, idiot.

54:37.080 --> 54:39.560
He wasn't, he wasn't called Al,

54:39.560 --> 54:43.960
it wasn't like he was Al 2.0, it was like another like hologram.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.600
There were other people working on the project with them,

54:46.600 --> 54:47.880
but there wasn't another person

54:47.880 --> 54:49.640
that was allowed to get in the holo chamber.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.640
What are you talking about?

54:51.640 --> 54:52.280
There was.

54:54.760 --> 54:58.120
This is all, all the Gooshy side plot has been edited out

54:58.120 --> 54:59.000
of this episode.

55:00.280 --> 55:02.440
It's gonna be very confusing for people when they listen

55:02.440 --> 55:05.800
and it just goes straight from the money zone to this.

55:05.800 --> 55:07.000
If you're just rejoining us,

55:08.440 --> 55:11.960
you have just been spared a 10 minute conversation

55:11.960 --> 55:16.040
about Gooshy, a real quantum leap character

55:16.040 --> 55:21.000
that leapt in to help Sam Beck at once when Al was busy.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.160
And it was a not a very good segment,

55:23.160 --> 55:27.000
but it was all about Gooshy and you really can't deny that.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.440
Thank you, Dennis Wolfberg for your one contribution

55:30.440 --> 55:31.960
to My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

55:31.960 --> 55:34.200
And I'm sorry that it was left on the cutting room floor.

55:34.200 --> 55:37.720
Maybe one day fucking archeologists

55:37.720 --> 55:39.240
will unearth the Gooshy tapes

55:39.240 --> 55:42.840
and everyone will have a nice laugh

55:42.840 --> 55:45.320
about the screaming argument Travis and I got into

55:45.320 --> 55:48.280
about Gooshy's, whether or not Gooshy,

55:48.280 --> 55:50.120
literally, if you wanna know what you're missing out on,

55:50.120 --> 55:52.040
yes, of course I know there was a Gooshy.

55:52.040 --> 55:54.040
The argument, the screaming argument we had

55:54.040 --> 55:56.840
was whether or not he ever entered into Al's holo chamber.

55:57.880 --> 56:00.120
And I don't wanna revive the argument,

56:00.120 --> 56:02.040
but I'm still very frustrated about it.

56:02.840 --> 56:05.720
I never thought that an argument about a man named Gooshy

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
would ever take place in my life

56:07.720 --> 56:09.560
or that I would ever feel so sure.

56:09.560 --> 56:11.640
He's torn another family apart.

56:11.640 --> 56:12.120
Yep.

56:12.120 --> 56:14.120
There was a virtual season of Quantum Leap

56:14.120 --> 56:15.800
that was all fan fiction.

56:15.800 --> 56:17.960
And one episode called Fallen Hero

56:17.960 --> 56:19.880
was about the death of Gooshy.

56:19.880 --> 56:22.360
Someone was so anti-Gooshy

56:22.360 --> 56:25.160
that they wrote fan fiction about the time he died.

56:26.680 --> 56:27.240
Anyway.

56:27.240 --> 56:28.280
That's savage.

56:28.280 --> 56:30.040
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

56:30.040 --> 56:30.440
By the way.

56:30.440 --> 56:32.040
It's a little bit of a short episode,

56:32.040 --> 56:33.800
but if you'd gotten the full Gooshy tapes,

56:33.800 --> 56:34.680
it would be a long episode.

56:34.680 --> 56:39.000
Short in that it was previously an hour and 45 minutes long.

56:40.120 --> 56:43.320
And most of that was Gooshy chat.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.640
By the way, if you listen to this

56:45.640 --> 56:47.560
and you work at Telltale Games,

56:47.560 --> 56:50.120
first of all, legally, you have to tell me where it's entrapment.

56:50.120 --> 56:54.440
Second of all, I will for free, for free,

56:54.440 --> 56:58.360
I will write the plot Bible and dialogue

56:58.360 --> 57:01.240
of a Quantum Leap adventure game series.

57:01.240 --> 57:03.080
I will do that shit for free.

57:03.080 --> 57:04.200
Tell me what it takes.

57:04.200 --> 57:06.120
And hey, would it kill you to throw Gooshy in there?

57:07.240 --> 57:08.920
Justin, it might kill me.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.640
Because I think I've developed a heart condition

57:11.640 --> 57:14.760
from this, again, screaming argument

57:14.760 --> 57:16.360
that Travis and I had about Gooshy.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.160
Can you play?

57:17.160 --> 57:19.240
Okay, Griffin, I have a special request for you.

57:19.960 --> 57:24.760
Can you include the entire Gooshy segment

57:25.800 --> 57:28.440
played at 1000 times speed

57:29.240 --> 57:33.800
or maybe 10,000 times speed in this segment?

57:33.800 --> 57:35.240
It would just be like, Gooshy out!

57:37.160 --> 57:40.920
I want you to include it here at the end of the podcast.

57:40.920 --> 57:42.680
So if someone is so inclined,

57:42.680 --> 57:43.960
they can take that audio,

57:43.960 --> 57:46.680
slow it down and enjoy the entire Gooshy conversation.

57:46.680 --> 57:48.600
I'm actually not going to do that

57:48.600 --> 57:52.920
because I'm embarrassed about how passionate,

57:52.920 --> 57:56.680
I don't get passionate about anything in this life anymore.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.640
I got very into the stuff that I thought

57:59.640 --> 58:01.240
happened to Gooshy and Quantum Leap.

58:01.240 --> 58:04.760
Very, very into it.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.120
This has been My Brother, My Brother Beats,

58:06.120 --> 58:07.240
a device show for the moderator.

58:07.240 --> 58:08.440
Thank you so much for listening.

58:09.640 --> 58:12.440
Thank you to Blue Apron.

58:18.200 --> 58:21.400

58:22.120 --> 58:24.120
Good news, if you haven't got enough of us this week,

58:25.720 --> 58:29.080
we have a very exciting project for you

58:29.080 --> 58:34.120
to enjoy, it's called Till Death Do Us Blart.

58:34.120 --> 58:36.680
It's a new annual podcast that will continue

58:36.680 --> 58:37.960
until the end of linear time.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.040
Starring, currently starring us

58:42.600 --> 58:45.240
and the guys from Worst Idea of All Time.

58:45.960 --> 58:47.880
It is a podcast that will continue forever.

58:47.880 --> 58:50.280
It will happen every year on American Thanksgiving.

58:50.280 --> 58:51.000
It will be released.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.080
It is a review and encapsulation

58:53.080 --> 58:55.640
of the film Paul Blart Mall Cop 2.

58:56.280 --> 58:57.960
You can find that on iTunes.

58:57.960 --> 59:00.760
You can find it wherever you,

59:01.320 --> 59:03.480
wherever fine podcasts are sold.

59:03.480 --> 59:06.680
If you wanna just subscribe, like old school,

59:07.480 --> 59:12.360
blart.libsyn.com slash RSS.

59:12.360 --> 59:13.800
You can just like get it.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.160
I'm gonna put my foot down.

59:15.160 --> 59:16.920
This podcast is gonna come out once a year.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.920
Don't subscribe to it.

59:18.920 --> 59:19.720
What are you doing?

59:19.720 --> 59:20.760
What are you talking about?

59:21.320 --> 59:22.600
Comes out once a year.

59:22.600 --> 59:23.800
But I'm gonna put out some secret stuff.

59:23.800 --> 59:24.840
But do download.

59:24.840 --> 59:26.920
But I'm gonna put out some secret stuff throughout the year.

59:26.920 --> 59:29.720
What's funnier than a subscription to a podcast

59:29.720 --> 59:30.920
that releases once a year?

59:30.920 --> 59:33.720
That's like, oh, I subscribe to the new Star Wars movies.

59:33.720 --> 59:35.960
Every time they come out, I get a little email alert.

59:35.960 --> 59:36.360
Really?

59:36.360 --> 59:37.880
They probably come out more frequently

59:38.680 --> 59:40.120
till death do us blart.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.160
That is a good point.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.360
Please subscribe to the show

59:44.040 --> 59:45.880
cause it helps us on iTunes

59:45.880 --> 59:47.880
and we wanna be a big success there.

59:47.880 --> 59:50.120
We also wanna make sure that everybody knows about

59:50.120 --> 59:54.280
Candle Nights, our annual holiday pan-religious,

59:54.280 --> 59:56.600
pan-sexual, personal pan holiday,

59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.040
celebration, December 21st in Huntington, West Virginia.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.160
Tickets are still available.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.840
I think some people ran into problems

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.520
because they used our old,

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.400
like the Candle Nights link from last year.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.320
Make sure you go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights two,

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.680
the number two.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.480
If you go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights,

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.960
it's gonna take you to the link from 2014,

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.520
which you can't get those tickets anymore

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.760
unless you can leap back there like Gushy.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.280
So go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights two,

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.560
come to Huntington, do our holiday thing with us.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.760
We're gonna hang out with you.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.320
We'll probably hang out afterwards.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.520
We're gonna have some beautiful posters, some merch.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.960
It was a great time last year.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.320
It's gonna be a great time this year

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.360
and we hope to see you there.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.760
Oh, don't sleep on that because we're 60% sold out

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.320
of that show.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.400
We've got less than a month.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.600
So you don't wanna miss out on that.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.880
Also, if you are coming, we have special rates for you

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.920
at the Pullman Plaza Hotel, 866-613-3611

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.520
or the Holiday Inn at the Big Sandy Arena,

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.920
which is right next to the venue, 304-523-8880.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.720
Those are both 99 bucks if you ask them for the

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.480
My Brother, My Brother, and Me rooms.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.600
So we got some discounts there if you wanna go that route.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.960
Also, I would recommend hopping on our Facebook group.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.800
Just search for My Brother, My Brother, and Me

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.560
and see if anybody wants like carpool

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.360
or like, you know, go in on a room or anything.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.320
Cause you know, maybe Huntington's not super convenient

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.120
but you wanna go.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.360
And if you could find like three other people to ride with,

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.640
it would make it a lot more fun.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.920
So do that.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.240
Also, as long as you're following us

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.360
and joining the group on Facebook,

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.320
you should follow us on Twitter, at MBAM.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.760
And check out our YouTube channel.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.840
We have a lot of animated videos on there,

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.600
a couple of live show clips.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.600
Justin put up the Till Death Do Us Blart preview on there,

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.200
which is really, really good.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.640
There's lots of fun stuff on there.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.000
And we're really close to like 10,000 subscribers on YouTube,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.200
which I have chosen as a very personal goal

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.320
that will finally make me feel

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.920
like I've done something with my life.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.280
So go subscribe to us on YouTube and be awesome.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.720
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.800
for using our theme song, Into Departure,

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.400
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.000
This is a really good album.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.080
So is When I Pretend to Fall.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.080
That's a good Long Winters album.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.000
John Roderick did a Christmas album,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.360
a holiday album with Jonathan Colton,

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.320
which is also good.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.840
Yeah, good music all around.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.120
I wanna personally recommend,

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.680
I have been listening to Quality Control,

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.880
Justin, the Polygon game review podcast

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.600
that Justin hosts and Griffin is regularly on.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.360
No joke, in the last like four days,

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.680
I've listened to every episode that exists of it.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.880
Because not only is it a game review podcast,

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.400
where you learn about games,

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.080
it also like really lets you in on the review process

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.640
and kind of teaches you not only about the games,

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.840
but like how they look at them, how they review them,

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.240
how they came up with the scores and reviews

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.520
and everything for them.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.920
And it's really been incredibly enlightening

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.440
and very, very funny.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.480
And even if you're like not a huge game player

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.440
or interested in games,

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.120
I think everybody would really like it.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.160
So go listen to Quality Control, I love it.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.840
Thanks, Trav, I appreciate it.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.360
Trav's got a great podcast too,

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.200
called Trends Like These with his buddy, Brent.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.320
Both very funny dudes taking on the news of the day

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.200
as it pertains to trending materials.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.040
And it's a very enjoyable show that I think you would like.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.280
So go get it, go fetch.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:33.800
Mongrel.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.040
Sing for your supper, gushy.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.840
It's the end of the show, right?

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.160
We're done?

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.600
Yeah, final Yahoo!

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.160
Sent in by the level 9,000 YajuJu Javenport.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:45.880
Thank you, Drew.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.520
It's about a YajuAnswers user, MusicIsLife.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.320
I didn't, oh God.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.480
I didn't read their name until just now

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.880
and their name combined with the subject matter of the question

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.960
is, it's one of my new faves.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.200
MusicIsLife asks,

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.840
what celebrity would you like to swim with?

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.920
Why are you just gushing?

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.040
I'm gushy.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:10.600
Stop it.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.160
This has been my brother, my brother.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.360
Can we kiss your gushy square?

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:26.920
I'm gushy.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:43.880
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:47.560
and is standing over a hoard of precious golden rubies.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.880
And he says, what do you do, adventurers?

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.000
I'm a dragon man.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:51.960
I cast fire on him.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.760
It's very good.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.680
I address the red dragon and say,

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.480
us, we're the hosts of the Adventure Zone, a podcast

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.960
about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.080
Very good synergy.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:01.960
Commit to the bit.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.560
I roll to charm new listeners.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.360
It is very effective against all odds.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.400
Everybody, we're the Mackroys.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.320
We host the Adventure Zones, a podcast where we play

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.440
Dungeons and Dragons together.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.720
It's a comedy podcast.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.080
We don't take the rules too seriously

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.120
because there's a lot of them

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.480
and we did not take the time to learn them.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.200
Maybe listen to us.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.840
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.560
You can find us on iTunes or on MaximumFun.org.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:33.320
I think this promo is a critical hit.
