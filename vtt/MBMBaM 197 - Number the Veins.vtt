00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:49.600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and me, an advice show from the modern era.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.760
I don't know why I decided to scat the title.

00:51.760 --> 01:01.600
I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.400
I'm your baby-est baby brother, Griffin.

01:04.400 --> 01:09.440
You know that he's actually saying words in rusted rude Simmi on my way.

01:09.440 --> 01:10.400
He's saying words.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.440
I know the words, I know the words.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.400
It's not, I think, scat on purpose.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.840
I used to think, is nobody safe, nobody on? It's not that.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.040
That is 100% it.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.640
Guys, I guess I'm less of the baby now, aren't I?

01:22.640 --> 01:23.360
Less of the baby.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.400
You're finally a man.

01:25.120 --> 01:25.840
Finally a man.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.680
It took me a few extra years on top of that.

01:29.680 --> 01:35.200
The McElroy tradition is at 27, 27.

01:35.200 --> 01:39.600
Griffin, how does 27 feel to you? How does it feel?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.280
I mean, here's the thing.

01:41.280 --> 01:47.760
Rachel got me a box of Tiff's Treats for my birthday, a local warm cookie delivery company,

01:47.760 --> 01:52.480
and I ate like three quarters of the box just like as soon as I received it.

01:53.040 --> 01:58.080
So I don't know that necessarily I'm more of an adult.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.680
Just that doesn't, it's not an adult way to consume cookies.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.000
My age is actually defined by the fact that if I did that, I would die.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.480
Yeah.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.800
How did your rum-tum tummy feel afterwards?

02:10.160 --> 02:11.280
Rum-tum shitty.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.240
Did not enjoy it.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.120
Yeah, I'm, I-

02:15.120 --> 02:17.520
Did not enjoy, would not recommend.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.320
No.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.320
Savor that right now, though, because it didn't kill you.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.800
No, I know, it sounds like I got it in under the fucking wire.

02:22.800 --> 02:28.000
Because I guess in like, what, six years, then like one of my feet will fall off if I try that.

02:28.560 --> 02:28.800
Yeah.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.360
Best time.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.400
It's such a big day.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.480
Griffin had his birthday on the 17th.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.040
By the way, P.O. Box 54, 120-

02:35.040 --> 02:39.280
If you want to send Justin presents for my birthday that I will never receive.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.120
I'll make sure he gets them.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.560
That's no problem.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.240
It's Griffin's 27th birthday.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.280
It's 420.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.000
It's Easter.

02:48.960 --> 02:49.680
He is risen.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.480
And there's going to be a new episode of Game of Thrones.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.760
That's what I'm most excited about.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.600
Travis was keen to point that out.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.920
I'm finally caught up after, I think the show's been on for eight years, and I finally, like,

02:59.920 --> 03:00.720
watched it.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.160
This shit's really good, you guys.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.360
I don't know if you know this.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.320
Yeah, thanks, Travis.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.160
It's like an underground success.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.720
I can't wait to read the novelization of the show.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.520
It's really bad.

03:10.400 --> 03:10.720
Yeah?

03:11.360 --> 03:15.200
It's boring and everybody has- here's something that surprised me if you read the books.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.360
All the people in the show have names.

03:17.360 --> 03:22.640
I thought three of them did, but no, they've all got names and none of them are like Dylan

03:23.280 --> 03:24.720
or like Ralphie.

03:25.360 --> 03:29.440
What's great, now that I'm caught up, it's having conversations with people about the

03:29.440 --> 03:33.840
show and this is, no joke, the conversation I had with my friend Charlie.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.600
Yeah, that one guy, Jory.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.800
No, the other one.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.520
Jorah?

03:37.520 --> 03:38.080
No, the other one.

03:38.080 --> 03:38.720
George.

03:38.720 --> 03:39.680
Marma.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.720
The onion guy?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.760
No, the other one.

03:41.760 --> 03:42.320
Stannis.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.200
No, I know Stannis.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.560
This is not Stannis.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.160
I don't know who you're talking about.

03:46.160 --> 03:50.880
I still- I've watched every episode of the show and I read the first two books and still

03:50.880 --> 03:55.120
there are times when I think that one of the guys is another guy.

03:55.120 --> 04:01.200
The guy who- I tell you the problem with this show is the guy who is down with the lady

04:01.200 --> 04:05.360
who wears red all the time, he is the most generic dude in the world.

04:05.360 --> 04:11.360
He could be popping up like every few scenes in like the background and I would not notice

04:11.360 --> 04:11.760
that.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.080
They could swap that actor out daily.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.520
Wait, do you mean Stannis?

04:15.520 --> 04:18.160
His name is basically Stan is also not helping.

04:18.960 --> 04:21.600
He looks like a fucking superintendent.

04:21.600 --> 04:27.360
But it's Stan's buddy, it's Stan's buddy gray beard dude, the onion, who I simply cannot

04:27.360 --> 04:29.760
remember his name except that he's the onion knight.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.280
Dr. Onion.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.760
Boy, the silly knight.

04:33.760 --> 04:34.880
Silly knight, onion boy.

04:34.880 --> 04:40.800
Like, there's not really anything funny about Game of Thrones so let's talk about our listeners

04:40.800 --> 04:43.120
and their problems and try to help them because that's what we do.

04:43.120 --> 04:43.840
Why?

04:43.840 --> 04:45.600
Yeah, let's just not talk about Jesus.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.640
I thought we were gonna skew into Jesus jokes for a while there and I thought we really

04:48.640 --> 04:49.200
pulled it out.

04:49.200 --> 04:49.920
Good job, guys.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.520
Yeah, I saved my one good he is risen joke for-

04:53.520 --> 04:58.160
He is blazin' 420.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.840
There's only one day worth coming back from the dead four.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.840
All you care about is babes and grindeds, Justin.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.200
I'm sick of it.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.720
And wheezing the juice.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.480
And wheezing and grinded.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.320
I've recently gotten back into the dating scene while in universe.

05:20.320 --> 05:26.240
Listen, this is an American show and if you're gonna write into it, it's college, which makes

05:26.240 --> 05:28.400
money for dates hard to come by.

05:28.400 --> 05:33.680
Is it in bad taste to use gift cards and coupons while on a date?

05:34.560 --> 05:35.280
Regards.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.800
I don't want to miss this chance in Canada.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.600
Oh, man.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.120
Oh, man.

05:41.120 --> 05:45.840
It's in bad taste if you're using Applebee's gift cards on that date.

05:45.840 --> 05:46.640
Because oopsies-

05:46.640 --> 05:48.400
Especially if you're not at Applebee's.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.840
Oopsie went to Applebee's.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.320
Do you accept Applebee's gift cards?

05:52.320 --> 05:53.600
So this is a red robin.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.000
Do they have-

05:54.000 --> 05:54.800
I'm aware.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.240
Do they have the bees in Canada?

05:57.760 --> 05:59.200
It's just called Le Applebee's.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.440
Oh, great.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.240
Yeah, no, why wouldn't it be called that for sure?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.680
But they have to have both on the side.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.600
So every Applebee's is huge.

06:09.600 --> 06:15.520
Because they have that- I thought every restaurant in Canada needed to be named after

06:16.240 --> 06:18.560
like a very manly sounding man.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.400
This is Paul Thwackam.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.200
I'm not joking.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.760
I thought every restaurant had to fall into like even top of the line,

06:29.120 --> 06:31.440
like a Vancouver bistro had to be called like-

06:31.440 --> 06:34.400
Are you basing this off of anything other than Tim Hortons?

06:34.960 --> 06:38.080
And Stan Makita's Donuts notwithstanding.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.480
Because I was living in Illinois and in Wayne's World.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.440
But close enough.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.040
I consider Illinois basically Canada's Alaska.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.200
Illinois is non-contiguous Canada.

06:53.600 --> 07:00.960
Isn't it odd how the very behaviors that might make someone a desirable life partner-

07:00.960 --> 07:01.920
Right, like frugality.

07:01.920 --> 07:10.000
Are antithetical to the actual wooing of said person.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.320
I don't know.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.120
I would be pretty goddamn wooed if somebody was like,

07:13.120 --> 07:14.720
oh, by the way, don't even worry about it.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.720
Groupon, he slammed down Groupon.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.120
I'd be all about that.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.160
Here's what you gotta do.

07:18.160 --> 07:24.240
I think Groupon has more- Okay, so let me- Okay, Groupon I think is trendier.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.520
I think Groupon has an air of hipness to it.

07:27.520 --> 07:31.520
If you pull out, like if you're at Captain D's and you pull out a coupon-

07:31.520 --> 07:32.560
You already fucked up.

07:32.560 --> 07:32.960
That's what I'm saying.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, hold on Justin.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.080
I'm gonna stop you there.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.800
I don't think the coupon's gonna have any impact on this.

07:38.800 --> 07:43.440
If you're at the D's or the B's, you've done fucked up before you even started.

07:43.440 --> 07:50.640
What if you say, listen, fella, I'm taking you to Applebee's and I'm gonna use a gift card.

07:50.640 --> 07:59.120
But I'm gonna use the differential on another date activity post dinner.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.760
So I have a $25 Applebee's gift card.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.640
You and me, we're gonna go to Applebee's and save some dope.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.400
But then I'm gonna take that $25 and then I'm gonna take you to Cold Stone

08:10.400 --> 08:14.400
for a little post Applebee's roundup and get you the German chocolate cake

08:14.400 --> 08:18.080
or maybe some of those ice cream cupcakes they got there that you like so much.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.040
And we'll just, I'll pass, basically what I'm saying is I'll pass the savings on to you.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.680
Can you just go right back through those revolving doors,

08:27.680 --> 08:30.000
right back into Applebee's for a second dip?

08:31.440 --> 08:36.400
You save, you drop the card, you pay for the entire first Applebee's dip,

08:36.400 --> 08:38.800
your first B's and you pay for all that.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.760
Like I got this.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.960
And then you bounce out, step outside, maybe have a smoke,

08:42.960 --> 08:48.560
post B's smoke in the Applebee's smoking plaza.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.120
And then you turn right back around and you go in

08:51.120 --> 08:54.240
and maybe you try a different one of their delicious $9 entrees.

08:54.880 --> 09:00.320
I have been to Applebee's, because of my geographical location,

09:00.320 --> 09:04.800
I've been to Applebee's more times than I care to admit.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.880
And of the many thoughts that have crossed my mind after an Applebee's meal,

09:08.880 --> 09:12.720
most of them regretful in nature, I've never thought to myself,

09:12.720 --> 09:18.480
the one I thought I've never had is, man, I just want to be here another hour.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.800
I just want to soak this in.

09:20.800 --> 09:25.040
I didn't see that picture of that lacrosse team nearly long enough.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.000
Those Jason Sudeikis commercials that he voices over

09:28.000 --> 09:30.800
at the end of Beach One is see you tomorrow.

09:30.800 --> 09:35.120
And that could be seen as sort of a veiled threat after you just finished.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.960
If you left to the Applebee's and you go home and you do have diarrhea

09:38.960 --> 09:41.360
and then you turn on one of those commercials and Sudeikis is like,

09:41.360 --> 09:44.160
hey, you are coming back here every day until you die.

09:45.120 --> 09:45.440
I don't know.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.480
Have you guys ever gotten carry out from an Applebee's?

09:49.360 --> 09:49.600
Yes.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.680
The method, I don't know if this is universal,

09:53.680 --> 10:00.240
but the method by which one gets carry out from Applebee's is the sketchiest,

10:00.240 --> 10:06.560
like most tacit admission that their whole atmosphere is the wackest.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.480
You have to, you tell them what car you're driving

10:10.480 --> 10:13.840
and you pull up to like a secret side door.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.200
You flash your blinkers twice.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.960
You flash your blinkers twice.

10:17.680 --> 10:18.800
You don't have to flash your blinkers,

10:18.800 --> 10:21.280
but it does help if you have your headlights on and they say,

10:21.280 --> 10:22.320
oh, there he is.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.440
He's in the Kia.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.880
Go take this out to him.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.320
And you exchange the money for services right in your car.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.040
It's the dirtiest.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.480
I'm always tempted when they bring the food out to say like,

10:34.480 --> 10:35.200
quick, quick, get in.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.000
Get in the passenger seat.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.040
I want to be able to see you.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.240
Let's do this in the car.

10:38.240 --> 10:38.960
People are watching.

10:38.960 --> 10:39.840
Yeah.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.800
You got the stuff.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.880
You got, hey, hey, what's in the bag?

10:45.440 --> 10:47.040
You got them onion dippers.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.760
You got onion blasters, straw slippers, slippers.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.280
I'll be back here tomorrow.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.440
I'll be here tomorrow because Jason Sudeikis told me to on TV.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.040
How about a real quick hand job?

11:00.080 --> 11:02.000
You accept, you give cards.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.400
My date's in the back seat.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.000
Hey, what's up?

11:06.000 --> 11:06.640
I'm the date.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.600
Hey, give him a hand job.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.800
You didn't forget the onion sloss, did you?

11:13.600 --> 11:16.480
That's a hybrid slaw and sauce for onions.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.280
Onion sloss.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.880
Dip it in and suck it down.

11:22.880 --> 11:23.440
Okay.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.160
How about a Yahoo?

11:24.160 --> 11:25.840
We have not helped this person at all.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.480
So in closing, you're welcome.

11:28.480 --> 11:33.600
I find frugality incredibly erotically fascinating.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.000
You're 27.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.640
Yeah.

11:36.640 --> 11:41.760
If I went on a date with someone and I pulled out, well, first of all, my wife would be very upset.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.840
But if I pulled out a gift card and they judge me harshly for that, I'd be like, okay, this is done.

11:47.200 --> 11:52.320
That's how you're judging my quality as a person is whether I use a gift card or not.

11:52.320 --> 11:57.680
I actually think if I went on a date with somebody who was disciplined enough to have a gift card,

11:57.680 --> 12:01.200
remember they had the gift card, go to the place to use the gift card,

12:01.200 --> 12:05.840
and then actually present the gift card, I would think, oh, thank God it's an adult.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.760
Thank God I have an adult to take care of me.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.160
Because the other side of that coin is basically if they judge you for it,

12:10.160 --> 12:12.960
what they're saying is like, oh, you couldn't just pay real money for that?

12:13.520 --> 12:14.080
Like, what?

12:14.080 --> 12:16.480
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.600
It's as good as money.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.440
It's just you turn it into onion sloss.

12:19.440 --> 12:19.940
Right?

12:20.960 --> 12:21.920
Same as money.

12:21.920 --> 12:26.720
I would be kind of bummed out because then I would know that that person has a grandpa that's

12:26.720 --> 12:34.560
maybe not so keen on getting to know what that person's it.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.320
Oh, like, oh, you have a pretty strained and distant relationship with your grandpa.

12:38.320 --> 12:38.960
That's too bad.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.920
Like, we probably would have waited until date four or five to bring that up.

12:41.920 --> 12:46.800
But that telltale bee's gift card has outed the secret, I guess.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.600
Yahoo me Griffin.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.800
I'll give you a tight Yahoo.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.200
This one's sent in by Cruz Flores.

12:53.200 --> 12:53.920
Thank you, Cruz.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Death Star, who asks,

12:58.800 --> 13:02.080
I want my cat to develop abs like Ninja Turtles.

13:02.080 --> 13:02.580
Mm-hmm.

13:04.000 --> 13:04.960
How can I do it?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.880
So he wants a warrior cat, basically.

13:09.600 --> 13:14.240
I don't think the warrior cats have sweet, sexy, rippling abs.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.680
Ah, they probably do somewhere.

13:16.320 --> 13:23.200
This person clearly seems unaware that the Ninja Turtles also do not have abs.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.440
I guess it was their shell.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.200
That's their shell, dumbass.

13:27.200 --> 13:27.680
Well, maybe-

13:27.680 --> 13:28.880
Jeez, read a book.

13:28.880 --> 13:35.040
Maybe they watched the trailer for the, what's that fucking, what's that dude's name?

13:35.040 --> 13:36.080
The one who makes all the movies?

13:36.720 --> 13:37.920
Michael Cheddar Bay.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.960
Steven Spielberg.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.320
Michael Bay.

13:42.080 --> 13:47.520
And he made that trailer, and you can tell, like, they look pretty busted, right?

13:47.520 --> 13:48.480
They look like they might-

13:48.480 --> 13:49.280
They don't look good.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.080
They look pretty, they look all ripped up.

13:52.080 --> 14:00.160
And I think you can just sort of intuit that they have, they're fucking blasting some green

14:00.160 --> 14:01.280
ass shippable shit in there.

14:01.280 --> 14:07.280
I thought that those Ninja Turtles, they look like a six-year-old's drawing of Ninja Turtles

14:07.280 --> 14:09.440
from, like, having watched, like, one episode.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.680
That is what the ones in the Michael Bay-

14:11.680 --> 14:14.640
But, like, creepily, like, all ripped and busted.

14:14.640 --> 14:21.040
Like, they look like Ninja Turtles that have been, like, smoking two packs a day since they

14:21.040 --> 14:21.540
were born.

14:21.540 --> 14:24.040
They look a little bit torn up.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.600
Like, since their heyday, they've just been sort of-

14:28.600 --> 14:30.440
It looks like underground.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.040
You'd think they would have lived since 1988.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.400
Yeah, kind of.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.280
Here's the other thing about us.

14:38.280 --> 14:42.520
You don't know, we're immortal, and we can never die, and we have to live in shells in

14:42.520 --> 14:43.080
the sewer.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.160
But we do clearly age.

14:45.160 --> 14:49.080
Yeah, the Ninja Turtles-

14:49.080 --> 14:51.560
They're beginning to look a lot more like Ninja Tortoises.

14:51.560 --> 14:58.040
Ninja Turtles came, and they saved me from Shredder, and it was awesome, and they smelled

14:58.040 --> 14:59.480
like a million grandmas.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.440
They stink like shit.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.960
They gave me some chocolates out of their purse, and it tasted like Virginia Slims.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.840
Did it- I mean, did they smell bad because they live in a sewer?

15:08.840 --> 15:15.160
No, they smelled like an old, old man that was, like, real ripped up and torn up, and

15:15.160 --> 15:16.360
just, like, real Haggard.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.960
They gave me an Applebee's gift card.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.240
They gave me an Applebee's gift card because they just couldn't be fucking bothered to

15:23.240 --> 15:23.880
get to know me.

15:27.080 --> 15:31.880
What does go through your head when you're like, you know what, I bet he would like

15:33.160 --> 15:35.960
Applebee's, but I don't know what he likes there.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.600
I can't just go get him the thing he wants if he doesn't want it right now.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.400
Don't you remember that one time when Billy told me all he wanted for Christmas was a

15:41.400 --> 15:42.680
couple of Brutuses?

15:42.680 --> 15:43.720
You remember.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.280
A couple shot glasses full of sugary goo.

15:47.320 --> 15:47.560
Okay.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.600
Canyon sloths.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.720
Okay, so listen.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.560
I want my cat to develop how he's like Ninja Turtles.

15:51.560 --> 15:55.080
I don't think it's outside the realm of possibilities because cats got tummies, and you can probably

15:55.080 --> 15:56.440
tighten that shit up.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.320
You could probably get that tummy a little bit tighter, kitty kitty.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.640
Cat crunches.

16:01.640 --> 16:05.640
What if you pick him up underneath their front legs, and then, because, like, as they're

16:05.640 --> 16:09.560
trying to get away, that seems like that would be good for the core, doesn't it?

16:09.560 --> 16:11.160
Like, you pick them up by their front.

16:12.120 --> 16:16.600
You pick them up, like, underneath their armpits, basically, and you hold them aloft, like, sort

16:16.600 --> 16:20.840
of like, uh, teach them to walk in the Lion King pose, right?

16:20.840 --> 16:25.320
And then they're flailing to try to get away from your grip, and while they're doing it,

16:25.320 --> 16:26.520
they're blasting their core.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.360
They're just getting super, super ripped.

16:28.360 --> 16:34.280
If I, if I kiss my kitty's tummy over and over again, just tickle and tickle my nose

16:34.280 --> 16:38.920
with soft, tummy hairs, is that going to give them a stronger core?

16:39.880 --> 16:41.560
It might, because they would get the giggles.

16:41.560 --> 16:46.920
And if you're giggling, laughter is the best medicine, or ab workout.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.440
Laughter is the best ab workout.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.160
I'll tickle this.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.440
You could also put that thing on their tummy that electroshocks it.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.320
Oh, tight, yeah.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.360
No, that would be good.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.880
And one of those, like, you could put them in one of those jiggly belts that you see in,

16:59.880 --> 17:01.960
like, 50s fitness things.

17:01.960 --> 17:05.960
Can I tell you how awesome it would be to walk into a room and see a cat just standing

17:05.960 --> 17:09.400
up in one of those things, like, drinking a Bloody Mary and smoking a cigarette and,

17:09.400 --> 17:10.760
like, getting fit.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.960
Cooking an, like, old-time microwave meal that, like, has, like, the foil and shit on it.

17:18.040 --> 17:23.000
I don't think, I don't think, I don't think there were microwave meals with foil on them

17:23.000 --> 17:24.520
at any point in recorded history.

17:25.080 --> 17:25.880
That seems like-

17:25.880 --> 17:28.680
No, I mean, it took them a while to, it took them a while to figure that shit out.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.480
This food has eyeballs on it.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.440
What are we doing wrong?

17:33.000 --> 17:33.720
We fucked up.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.280
We don't understand microwaves.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.640
You know that we couldn't use microwaves for the first 30 years after they were invented

17:39.640 --> 17:41.800
because we kept trying to put foil in there?

17:44.520 --> 17:49.800
Justin, I don't think I can go on the rest of the show just because I, since this idea

17:49.800 --> 17:55.640
was first proposed, all I can think about is your chunky dumpster of a cat with one

17:55.640 --> 17:58.040
of those shake, with one of those shake belts on it.

17:58.040 --> 18:03.160
And just, like, imagining how that would, how that would go.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.600
First off, Claudia Jean is slimming down.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.400
How much?

18:07.400 --> 18:08.120
What's she down to?

18:08.840 --> 18:10.280
She's down to 18 pounds.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.640
That's from 20.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.280
So she's, like, on the road to recovery.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.240
She's trying to get fit.

18:15.240 --> 18:19.800
She hates every second of it, and she still won't exercise even though I asked her to.

18:19.800 --> 18:24.360
And I got her that Billy Blanks tape she asked for, and she doesn't ever put it in.

18:24.360 --> 18:24.840
Ever.

18:24.840 --> 18:29.960
The closet is just full of different articles, those stretchy, like, ropes and, like, the

18:29.960 --> 18:30.920
perfect push-up.

18:31.640 --> 18:32.120
All of it.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.480
The ab roller, none of it.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.280
She won't touch it.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.280
She asked for them, and then once they show up, like, oh, I don't remember.

18:39.000 --> 18:39.400
I don't know.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.960
Maybe I'll definitely, definitely try that.

18:41.960 --> 18:42.520
Oh, yeah.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.160
She won't.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.320
Good suggestione.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.200
Let me see that.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.200
Yeah, I'll read this during lunch.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.440
Did you just want me to pee on this?

18:50.440 --> 18:54.680
Or, no, I would like you to use it and blast your core.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.080
Please.

18:56.120 --> 19:02.120
If your cat was on The Biggest Loser, which, which trainer do you think she'd want to be

19:02.120 --> 19:02.680
teamed up with?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.240
Jarlington?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.200
Jarlington.

19:06.200 --> 19:06.440
Yeah.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.240
Claude Jarlington?

19:07.240 --> 19:08.200
Claude Jarlington.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.040
He is, he is two of them.

19:10.040 --> 19:14.360
Yeah, he exercised so hard that he divided via mitosis.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.400
And if you hurt one, the other feels its pain like those brothers from the GI Joe.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.120
Exactly that.

19:20.120 --> 19:20.440
100%.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.520
You got it 100% right.

19:22.520 --> 19:22.840
Thanks.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.320
I mean, like, yes, my cat's overweight.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.680
Like, I didn't know what I was.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.200
I don't know how it happened.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.440
You feed her turkey out of the fridge.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.320
Not anymore.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.520
And also, she loves it.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.680
One of my hobbies is traditional archery.

19:38.680 --> 19:43.480
I enjoy archery because it's a calm, methodical, physical skill that gets me outside.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.840
However, I also have a geeky interest in history and fantasy.

19:47.480 --> 19:51.880
For a long time, I've been looking at clothes that would pass for a peasant longbow man.

19:51.880 --> 19:59.160
Uh, but I think I can get an ensemble that I will enjoy for around $80.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.400
But the thought of spending this much pains me.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.280
We have a medieval outfit.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.120
While having a medieval outfit would be cool.

20:08.120 --> 20:12.280
I do not think I would be brave enough to wear it in public.

20:12.280 --> 20:18.200
Not public in general, but well, no fairs or Halloween parties, sans deadly weapon.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.360
Uh, even if I could work up the courage to dress up outside the house,

20:22.360 --> 20:26.440
it bothers me that I would spend money on something I would only wear a few times a year.

20:26.440 --> 20:34.840
Brothers, should I indulge in my geek side or just, uh, let a fun dream be a fun dream?

20:34.840 --> 20:37.960
That's from Maryman in Minnesota.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.760
Holy shit.

20:43.000 --> 20:43.960
This is the best question.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.240
It's really good because we've all struggled with this at some point.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.720
We've all been here in some variation.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.120
Uh, I have a few questions.

20:54.120 --> 21:00.840
First off, you've said you'd only wear it to places like rent fairs or Halloween parties,

21:00.840 --> 21:04.440
but you'd wear it without the deadly weapon.

21:04.440 --> 21:12.360
So from what I can tell, there is no context in which the bow and the garb,

21:12.360 --> 21:16.280
the tunic would be worn simultaneously.

21:16.280 --> 21:16.920
Okay.

21:16.920 --> 21:22.040
So I don't see the connection to your archery, right?

21:22.040 --> 21:22.920
First off.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.280
Have you guys ever seen Arrow?

21:25.320 --> 21:26.360
Hell yes.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.360
Please, can we not talk about Arrow?

21:29.960 --> 21:33.480
It's just once you get Justin fucking going on Arrow, good luck.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.520
You guys want to talk about Arrow?

21:34.520 --> 21:36.440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not again.

21:37.000 --> 21:37.720
I can't fall into this.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.960
Can this guy get a Kickstarter going?

21:42.680 --> 21:44.840
I would kickstart your tunic.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.600
I would kickstart all $80 of it.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.200
Absolutely.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.200
America's Next Top Arrowman.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.120
Let me say this, Merry Man.

21:52.120 --> 21:57.080
You better have some compelling reward tiers because I think you are going to be passing

21:58.680 --> 22:01.000
the early boundaries.

22:01.000 --> 22:08.760
One, I assume $80 to buy the tunic, $10,000 for your medical bills after somebody beats your ass.

22:08.760 --> 22:17.240
And then once you get past $10,080, I want to know what else you've got cooking up.

22:17.240 --> 22:21.400
I don't think in any of these situations that this person is talking about, wearing

22:21.400 --> 22:28.200
this peasant longbowman garb is one that is going to get their ass beat.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.400
Here is my thing.

22:29.400 --> 22:34.360
I've been thinking about this probably a lot more than is natural or healthy, but do you

22:34.360 --> 22:39.400
think that when you roll out to a run for it, there's got to be a hierarchy of the dudes who

22:39.400 --> 22:47.240
have spent $8,000, $10,000 on their full suits of armor, and then they see somebody roll up in just

22:47.240 --> 22:52.200
a puffy shirt and leather pants, and they're like, check out this bugger.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.840
Fuck spending $8,000, $10,000 on a full suit of armor.

22:54.840 --> 23:00.520
How about the people who have spent 30 or 40 years becoming a goddamn blacksmithing

23:00.520 --> 23:07.640
artisan, like going out and, you know, farming tin ore in the Hillsbrad foothills and then

23:07.640 --> 23:12.760
coming home to smelt that shit and then making armor for themselves specifically that they can

23:12.760 --> 23:16.360
only wear in this one fucking scenario.

23:17.160 --> 23:20.120
I think that they are probably at the top of the caste system.

23:20.760 --> 23:24.120
So you have to imagine that, like, there is the possibility you would roll up to the

23:24.120 --> 23:30.920
bin fair and suddenly a swarm of ne'er-do elves would descend upon you and beat your ass.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.200
I think that's possible.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.040
That's why you gotta have that bow.

23:34.760 --> 23:35.960
You gotta be armed.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.480
Yeah, definitely.

23:37.480 --> 23:41.400
I don't think you can wear a tunic without the bow to back it up, I guess is what I'm

23:41.400 --> 23:42.360
saying to you.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.640
That's beautiful.

23:43.640 --> 23:47.320
I also don't understand the compulsion to dress like a peasant longbowman.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.680
We're all play and pretend.

23:48.680 --> 23:54.360
Listen, most days I wear cargo shorts and a t-shirt.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.640
And if that's not modern day peasant garb, I don't know what is.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.600
So I don't know why at a rim fair I wouldn't want to dress up like a fancy jimmy.

24:00.600 --> 24:04.440
It's like going to San Diego Comic Con and cosplaying as Jimmy Olsen.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.360
Like, get fucked together.

24:08.120 --> 24:11.160
I'm Fitzpatrick Fitzwallis, the guy Superman rescues.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.240
Yeah, I'm Spider-Man's landlord.

24:15.240 --> 24:15.880
My name's Hank.

24:15.880 --> 24:16.380
Hank.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.400
Hank Landlordman.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.640
I got the powers of I fix that faucet for you.

24:23.640 --> 24:24.360
No problem.

24:25.000 --> 24:25.800
Let me know if you got any other questions.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.480
And I don't ask any questions.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.720
I'm real dumb.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.920
I do know his dark secret, though.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.000
He takes really bad shits.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.040
Clogs that mother crapper up.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.600
Spent a lot of time on Spidey's clogs.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.680
Here's the one thing about me.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.440
I'm really good at getting blood out of stuff.

24:44.440 --> 24:47.000
He bleeds all over everything, that kid.

24:47.000 --> 24:47.880
No problem.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.720
No big deal.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.400
I fix that squeaky window too, Pete.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.760
The one you used to get in and out of your apartment.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.520
Can I make a suggestion?

24:58.200 --> 25:03.240
If you want a garb to go along with your archery,

25:03.240 --> 25:07.080
can I suggest instead of a peasant longbow garb,

25:08.040 --> 25:11.960
you instead cosplay as Geena Davis?

25:11.960 --> 25:14.680
I love this.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.200
Just like real life Geena Davis?

25:16.200 --> 25:17.480
Not like character Geena Davis.

25:17.480 --> 25:18.600
Real life Geena Davis.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.040
Real life Geena Davis who's a master archer.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.080
Who's a goddamn incredible archer.

25:21.080 --> 25:21.880
Incredible badass.

25:22.920 --> 25:26.520
Can I get a fat head for my baby daughter's wall

25:26.520 --> 25:29.800
of Geena Davis, like mid archery?

25:29.800 --> 25:30.920
That would be amazing.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.600
This is who I want you to aspire to.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.440
The star of Cutthroat Island and master archer Geena Davis.

25:37.480 --> 25:38.840
Also check out Speechless.

25:38.840 --> 25:39.480
Not bad.

25:39.480 --> 25:40.600
Pretty okay.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.120
Let me check the warehouse.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.960
Let me check in the back in the stock room.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.960
We only have a fat head of Geena Davis from Earth Girls Are Easy.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.240
I knew it.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.200
It's always that.

25:50.200 --> 25:54.040
Listen, after that movie came out, well before it came out,

25:54.040 --> 25:57.160
they produced, I don't want to give away their trade secrets,

25:57.160 --> 25:59.960
but four and a half million fat heads of Geena Davis

25:59.960 --> 26:01.160
from Earth Girls Are Easy.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.880
Because they thought that that was going to take the world

26:03.880 --> 26:07.480
by storm, that those classic characters as portrayed

26:07.480 --> 26:12.200
by Jim Carrey, oh, I can do this.

26:14.200 --> 26:14.680
Come on.

26:14.680 --> 26:15.640
Jeff Daniels.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.240
Incorrect.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.520
No, you messed it.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.720
You switched your Jeffs.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.320
Jeff Goldblum.

26:22.120 --> 26:22.840
Correct.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.680
And Ah Wayans.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
Ah, but which Wayans, sir?

26:27.800 --> 26:29.640
Ah, the oldest question.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.320
Damon Wayans, senior.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.520
Damn it's who you're looking for.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.520
So we're all agreed that you need to buy yourself an outfit, right?

26:36.520 --> 26:37.000
Yeah, buy it.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.480
For $80, wear it where you feel comfortable.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.000
It'll feel tight to have it, I bet.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.720
If you want it, here's my thing.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.400
If you want it, fucking buy it.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.680
It's not going to, if it's not going to hurt you,

26:46.680 --> 26:47.400
fucking buy the thing that's going to make you happy.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.000
We need to rebuild this economy.

26:49.000 --> 26:49.880
Too sweet.

26:49.880 --> 26:50.360
Right.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.000
Yes.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.240
There are leather workers that are desperate for a client

26:55.240 --> 26:59.880
and you can provide them an admittedly apparently meager amount of work.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.040
I'm saying $80 is, that's nothing.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.640
Ooh, ooh, what about this?

27:04.200 --> 27:05.320
Teach yourself a skill.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.720
Fucking sew that outfit yourself.

27:08.600 --> 27:09.400
Oh, that's good.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.920
Get that, go to Joann Fabrics, get the tunic pattern

27:13.720 --> 27:16.600
and some lovely prints and just make it for yourself.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.200
I love that.

27:18.200 --> 27:18.840
Fucking earn it.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.200
And then if anyone tries to give you shit about it, be like, oh yeah, I made it.

27:22.760 --> 27:30.120
Don't think of it as $80 you're only spending to dress up once in a great while.

27:30.120 --> 27:34.680
Think of it as an investment in post-apocalypse protection.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.440
Because after the revolution comes and the grid is shut down,

27:39.000 --> 27:44.520
the man who spent all his time making armor and learning archery

27:44.520 --> 27:47.880
are going to be the only ones worth a damn.

27:47.880 --> 27:52.200
To get shot to death by the guy who bought a hundred guns.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.560
No, guns won't work either.

27:53.560 --> 27:54.680
I have a hundred guns.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.320
What do you have?

27:55.320 --> 27:56.600
I can make a doublet.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.680
Well, okay, cool, cool.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.680
I will trade you a gun for a doublet.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.480
Done.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.720
That's called free market.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.920
And then you shoot that man to death and take all his guns.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.160
Tailoring wins the day.

28:13.160 --> 28:16.280
I want to go to the money zone.

28:26.440 --> 28:27.560
You're listening to a podcast.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.600
I know you like podcasts.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.560
Don't try to trip.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.000
I want you to subscribe to the Optimism Club podcast.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.080
That's on iTunes and Stitcher.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.440
That's with Steve Ball and Andy Ditchell.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.560
They sit down and talk about what's new and exciting in the world.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.360
Possibly Dictal?

28:43.160 --> 28:43.660
Digital?

28:45.080 --> 28:48.360
Andy Digital, your digital co-host.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.880
They talk about what's exciting in the world of pop culture.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.480
Think like Max Headroom.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.240
Yes, Steve, great joke.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.440
Bitch, can I do my ad, please?

28:56.440 --> 28:56.940
Thank you.

28:57.880 --> 28:58.920
Jesus Christ.

28:58.920 --> 28:59.960
It's not like this.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.160
I bet they let each other finish fucking sentences

29:03.160 --> 29:06.440
whilst they discuss everything from movies and TV comic books.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.640
Anything you possibly nerd out about without fail,

29:09.640 --> 29:11.240
they also spin off on borderline.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.920
Insane tangents.

29:12.920 --> 29:16.760
Like how every movie would be improved by introducing hyper intelligent apes.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.320
I do agree on that front.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.840
It's on iTunes.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.120
It's on Stitcher.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.480
Or you can like their Facebook page.

29:23.480 --> 29:24.840
It's called the Optimism Club.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.600
Catch it.

29:26.600 --> 29:30.840
I want to talk to you guys about a very personal thing close to my heart

29:30.840 --> 29:31.880
that I just learned about.

29:33.640 --> 29:37.960
I demand actually that you donate to the Doodle Game Kickstarter.

29:37.960 --> 29:42.280
You can go to doodlegame.com slash my brother for more info

29:42.280 --> 29:43.960
and my bim bam fan doodles.

29:43.960 --> 29:44.920
Now I should point out,

29:45.960 --> 29:47.800
all these times I've said doodle,

29:47.800 --> 29:54.360
I should have spelled it because it's actually D-U with an umlaut, D-L-E.

29:54.360 --> 29:59.240
If you're just entering the URL, I don't think you have to hit the umlaut button.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.040
Just D-U-D-L-E game.com will get you there.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.400
Oh my god.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.600
These are amazing.

30:05.720 --> 30:09.000
Doodle, pronounced doodle.

30:09.000 --> 30:09.720
They pronounce it.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.080
They provide a pronunciation guide.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.200
I was about to call it doodle.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.520
It's a party game of illustrating randomly generated phrases.

30:16.520 --> 30:17.240
How do you play?

30:17.240 --> 30:19.080
Each player draws five cards.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.120
One adjective, two nouns, one verb and one adverb

30:22.120 --> 30:24.680
and then tries to illustrate that phrase.

30:24.680 --> 30:27.320
Can the other players guess your phrase based on your drawing?

30:27.320 --> 30:28.840
If you like my bim bam laughing

30:28.840 --> 30:31.320
and playing creative tabletop games with your friends,

30:31.320 --> 30:33.560
then donate to the Doodle Game Kickstarter.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.480
And like I said before,

30:35.480 --> 30:40.520
you can check out some bim bam specific content at doodlegame.com slash my brother,

30:40.520 --> 30:42.040
which I'm going to look at right now.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.280
Yeah, yes.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.160
Holy shit.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.360
These are incredible.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.040
There's tiny Amelie Pokemon singing sexily.

30:50.040 --> 30:50.440
Okay.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.720
There's a middle-est ghost horse shoplifting poorly.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.840
Cosmic bear god devouring furiously.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.120
Oh man, dirty corncob boy.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.920
Warrior Pokemon juggalos sad living quietly.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.200
Oh man.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.160
Baby orb yahoo answering expertly.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.040
Worried groundhog detective swiping dramatically.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.240
All right, listen.

31:11.240 --> 31:16.280
Go to this dirty corncob boy hiding Edward Snowden happily.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.640
Oh, there's some good stuff.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.520
Doodle game.

31:18.520 --> 31:23.480
It's a d-u-d-l-e game dot com forward slash my brother dot html.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.440
Oh, that's great.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.080
I want to play that.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.360
Oh God, that's really funny.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.920
Go, go look at that and kickstart their game.

31:30.920 --> 31:31.960
God, I'm starving.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.320
I need to eat before the show and I'm starving.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.240
Do you want to like take a break?

31:37.880 --> 31:39.400
No, I can't take a break.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.200
I'm too busy.

31:40.200 --> 31:45.160
Do you want to eat these fatty corn chips and sloppy, slimy, fatty, greasy Doritos?

31:45.160 --> 31:48.360
I'm trying to lose weight Griffin, please help me.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.360
And I bet they've got GMOs.

31:50.360 --> 31:55.960
They hire stuff with GMOs, but I've heard online from a friend that I met online that

31:55.960 --> 31:58.760
GMOs are good for you because they help your bones get stronger.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.280
Incorrect.

32:01.240 --> 32:05.000
That the only thing that's good for you in the world that you can trust is nature box

32:05.640 --> 32:07.000
at nature box.com.

32:07.000 --> 32:14.360
They've got delicious, nutritious, superstitious snacks that they send right to your door and

32:14.360 --> 32:17.240
they're great for you and they're delicious.

32:17.240 --> 32:23.800
They got BBQ kettle kernels, everything, bagel sticks, yeah, South Pacific plantain chips.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.400
And they're healthy.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.240
They do not pack with GMOs.

32:29.240 --> 32:29.800
They're packed with superstitions.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.240
What about my bones though?

32:31.960 --> 32:35.560
Your bones will really enjoy eating everything.

32:35.560 --> 32:45.640
Bagel sticks, BBQ kernels and our personal favorite salted caramel pretzel pops.

32:45.640 --> 32:49.640
I want to try it, you know, I want to try it, but I don't want to pay full price.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.160
Can anybody help me?

32:51.160 --> 32:52.280
I can Justin.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.520
I will loan you some money.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.440
If you try nature box right now, you will get 50% off your first box.

32:59.160 --> 33:03.160
You just have to go to nature box.com forward slash my brother 50% off your first box.

33:03.160 --> 33:07.240
Like there's a $30 box that I think contains 10 bags.

33:07.240 --> 33:12.920
I should know because I just ordered it, but 10 bags for 30 bucks, 50% off $15.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.360
It's an amazing deal.

33:14.360 --> 33:18.360
You can choose your snacks and then they send you a new box every month and you can like

33:18.360 --> 33:20.520
mix up the snacks and they're delicious.

33:20.520 --> 33:21.800
They really are quite good.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.640
Nature box.com slash my brother and you get 50% off go.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.160
Okay, now I'm full, but you know what else?

33:29.160 --> 33:30.040
I'm bored.

33:30.040 --> 33:33.720
Oh God, you are a fucking super needy guy.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.600
Did you know that?

33:34.600 --> 33:35.640
You're like a child.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.680
Fill my holes industry.

33:38.680 --> 33:39.560
Oh boy.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.640
Fill the holes in my life capitalism.

33:41.640 --> 33:45.480
Extreme restraints is not advertising with this episode.

33:45.480 --> 33:50.520
Your holes will remain vacant.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.520
Justin, do you like television?

33:53.240 --> 33:53.480
What?

33:54.040 --> 33:55.880
Yeah, I guess I like television.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.560
I hate watching television because when is anything ever on?

33:59.560 --> 34:00.840
I don't know when anything's on.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.120
I know I'm paying for cables.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.960
A real pain in the old patootie.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.400
That's the end.

34:07.400 --> 34:08.120
Next question.

34:08.920 --> 34:14.840
Our new secret fourth brother, Rosie O'Donnell, is really making a splash on this episode.

34:14.840 --> 34:15.800
Here's the good news.

34:15.800 --> 34:19.960
I've got a couch ball just rocking it out of my monitor and I had to dodge it the last second.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.760
So what you need to do is sign up for Hulu Plus.

34:22.760 --> 34:27.400
With Hulu Plus you get all the episodes of current seasons of stuff like Family Guy,

34:27.400 --> 34:33.000
Parks and Recreation, Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and also like Community and South Park

34:33.000 --> 34:36.360
shows that you already love and you can get them as new episodes come out.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.160
And you can watch them on-

34:37.160 --> 34:40.120
And now I'm fucking literally everything.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.680
Travis, sometimes you sound so much like a commercial.

34:42.680 --> 34:45.640
I think you must be reading something, but like you're not.

34:45.640 --> 34:46.280
You're just-

34:46.280 --> 34:47.320
Just flipping it off the dome.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.400
I'm just a fucking awesome salesman.

34:49.400 --> 34:53.240
You're like half commercial and you can, they got original shows, right?

34:53.240 --> 34:57.720
There's a new one I saw, a commercial for, while I was watching something else on Hulu

34:57.720 --> 35:02.280
called Deadbeat, which is about a guy who smokes pot and can talk to ghosts.

35:02.280 --> 35:07.640
And it's that dude from Reaper who was like the best part of that show Reaper.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.520
That short-lived show Reaper that he was the best part of.

35:11.560 --> 35:17.320
It's $7.99 a month and you can watch all these shows basically on any device that you want.

35:17.320 --> 35:22.360
But if you sign up now at HuluPlus.com slash my brother, all one word,

35:22.360 --> 35:25.800
you will get two weeks of full access totally free.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.160
That is an extra week more than the standard demo period.

35:29.160 --> 35:35.480
And you will get that extra week on us really luxuriating at HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.560
Hey, I'm Jesse Thorne from Maximumfun.org.

35:39.560 --> 35:44.920
Last year, we got together with some of our favorite comedians and musicians and put them on a boat.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.000
It was a huge success and we had such a great time.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
We've decided to do it again this summer.

35:49.000 --> 35:55.160
The second annual Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival sets sail on July 25th,

35:55.160 --> 35:57.400
though technically there are no sales.

35:57.400 --> 36:01.720
Comedians will include W. Kamau Bell, Karen Kilgarriff, Greg Barrett,

36:01.720 --> 36:05.240
Moshe Kasher, Kyle Kinane, Natasha Leggero and more.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.760
Our music night is hosted by the great John Roderick of The Long Winters

36:08.760 --> 36:11.400
and you can check out Jean Grey and others.

36:11.400 --> 36:16.120
To learn more about the Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival and to book your passage,

36:16.120 --> 36:21.720
visit boatparty.biz. The Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.680
Comedy. Music. Shuffleboard.

36:26.840 --> 36:32.360
I have a co-worker who I share my position with who daily talks about having sex.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.760
You can say it. It's fine. This is a safe space.

36:34.760 --> 36:41.160
Our show has a teen rating on iTunes so we can say we can address these adult topics.

36:41.160 --> 36:49.800
Having sex with his girlfriend or before that, just random girls.

36:50.680 --> 36:56.200
I don't want to hear his dirty board stories, but he seems to delight in bragging.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.960
I have asked him to stop, but it only seems to make him enjoy it.

36:59.960 --> 37:00.840
Oh God.

37:03.080 --> 37:06.200
How do I get him to stop telling me about his late night escapades?

37:06.200 --> 37:09.400
And that's from Don't Talk About Your Genitalia in Australia.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.320
Pretty, pretty, pretty good.

37:11.320 --> 37:14.360
It seems like the solution's in the question.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.200
If only he enjoys it when you tell him not to talk about it,

37:18.200 --> 37:20.120
you gotta beg him to talk about it.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.280
Oh, more details.

37:22.280 --> 37:22.760
How'd you-

37:22.760 --> 37:25.640
Go on. Tell me about how you used your penis again.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.640
Who did you stick it to?

37:28.760 --> 37:30.600
Number the veins, Carlton.

37:30.600 --> 37:34.440
Oh my God. God.

37:34.440 --> 37:38.120
Who?

37:38.120 --> 37:40.040
Paint a picture of my mind with these-

37:40.040 --> 37:41.640
Numbers of details.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.080
Numbers of veins?

37:43.720 --> 37:45.320
Numbers of veins.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.720
It was actually more upsetting to me that his name was Carlton.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.600
That's-

37:48.600 --> 37:51.240
Qualify the problem, Carlton.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.760
That is my favorite Lewis Lowry book.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.720
No. No.

37:57.720 --> 37:58.520
Is it not okay?

37:59.320 --> 38:01.320
Cannot. Will not. Should not.

38:01.320 --> 38:05.480
I think Travis is so right.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.040
You have to beg for more details.

38:08.040 --> 38:14.440
There is no verbal picture he will paint for you

38:14.440 --> 38:17.000
that could ever be resplendent enough.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.360
You have to continue to elicit adjectives from this man

38:22.360 --> 38:25.160
until he can't adjectivize no more.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.400
And when he's done, when he finishes the story,

38:27.400 --> 38:28.760
he's like, yeah, I don't want to talk about it anymore.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.720
You gotta look at him like,

38:29.720 --> 38:31.960
and now I need you to really give it to her tonight

38:31.960 --> 38:34.040
and remember every detail.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.760
Really perform above and beyond, Carlton.

38:36.760 --> 38:39.160
Come in tomorrow and tell me everything.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.200
Bring a talk boy to the bedroom with you.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.600
Record your entire lovemaking session

38:44.600 --> 38:48.120
and then transcribe it so we can discuss tomorrow.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.720
A lot of pressure here, Carlton,

38:49.720 --> 38:51.560
but I'm looking at you to be my big champ.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.520
I want some Kinsey-ass fucking science, doc.

38:54.520 --> 39:00.440
I want you to quantify every ounce of fluid.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.440
Don't you dare skip to the climax.

39:04.840 --> 39:08.280
If only there was some sort of position,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.920
some sort of position that we could invent right now

39:12.920 --> 39:16.520
that would exist inside of a corporate sort of structure

39:17.800 --> 39:22.040
that you could talk to and complain about your coworker

39:22.040 --> 39:25.800
who's talking about his jizz sessions on the daily.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.960
If only there was like, you know,

39:27.960 --> 39:29.560
how there's like different positions like,

39:31.400 --> 39:37.800
you know, receptionist and, you know, data management.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.040
If only there was a position like that

39:40.040 --> 39:42.360
that was like jizz complaint receiver.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.680
What about executioner?

39:45.720 --> 39:47.960
Like you're talking about the HR department.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.680
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.360
You know what now?

39:52.360 --> 39:53.320
Why haven't you done that?

39:53.320 --> 39:56.120
That's like the obvious, it's like I cut my arm wide open.

39:56.120 --> 39:56.600
What do I do?

39:56.600 --> 39:59.480
Like you go to a doctor or you put a bandaid.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.880
Like there's a thing to do already.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.640
Now to be fair, to be fair,

40:03.640 --> 40:06.760
this person does not list what industry they are in.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.360
So it's quite possible that they exist in a business

40:10.360 --> 40:12.680
in which there is no HR department.

40:12.680 --> 40:16.600
There is no field, professional field,

40:16.600 --> 40:19.000
you can work in where this behavior is acceptable.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.280
Like none, except unless it's Dirty Story Boys,

40:22.280 --> 40:25.880
the Dirty Story Boy Company, Inc. Co.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.880
Where you only tell dirty stories to other boys.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.920
That is the only business if you have made-

40:34.920 --> 40:36.600
And it is thriving.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.600
And it is fucking hopping.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.920
Our next sponsor is Dirty Story Boys.

40:42.280 --> 40:45.000
If you're a dirty boy and you love dirty stories,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
come on down to Dirty Story Boys,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.560
where we are gonna set you up with the dirtiest stories

40:49.560 --> 40:51.000
and the dirtiest boys.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.360
Every detail, number the veins, quantify the throbbing.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.520
Also all your saltwater aquarium needs.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.200
We also have accessories, come on down.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.800
We're branching off.

41:01.800 --> 41:05.080
I fucked this girl in college once

41:05.080 --> 41:07.720
and it was real cool.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.080
That will be $10.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.640
For what?

41:12.280 --> 41:13.960
What am I giving you $10 for?

41:14.600 --> 41:16.200
Man, if you want more, you gotta pay more.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.800
You know what I mean?

41:17.800 --> 41:20.120
That was the $10 package.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.040
Adjective free, two sentences.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.000
That's what you get.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.120
Once I watched that Showgirls movie

41:26.120 --> 41:29.880
and it had that lady from Saved by the Bell in it

41:29.880 --> 41:32.680
and I got my first boner, that will be $20.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.480
Cause that was embarrassing.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.680
Cause that was embarrassing.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.040
That's a celebrity story.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.120
That's a celeb porn story.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.120
Celeb encounter.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.400
That was a celeb encounter.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.760
That's a special diamond package here at Dirty Boy Stories.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.560
That will be $20.

41:49.560 --> 41:50.600
That's $30.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.360
I explained my business model to you,

41:52.360 --> 41:53.160
which is in a way.

41:54.840 --> 41:57.640
One time I saw Susan Sarandon taking a shower

41:57.640 --> 41:59.880
but it turned out it was my aunt Diana

41:59.880 --> 42:01.960
who only looks like Susan Sarandon.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.320
That'll be a hundred dollars.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.200
People love that.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.920
That's a very specific audience,

42:10.920 --> 42:12.280
but they'll gobble it up.

42:12.280 --> 42:12.920
Sure.

42:12.920 --> 42:16.440
30storyboys.mbmbam.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.280
They're gonna give you your first story for free.

42:22.360 --> 42:23.880
It won't be a great one.

42:23.880 --> 42:26.680
It won't be a top of the line one.

42:26.680 --> 42:27.000
Right.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.520
It's gonna be a bottom tier.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.320
You get a sampler.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.720
Within the next month, I'm getting a new boss.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.280
It was an internal hire outside my department,

42:36.280 --> 42:38.760
but I see my soon to be supervisor every now and then.

42:38.760 --> 42:39.560
I'm personable.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.200
I try to make small talk when I see him.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.160
How's it going?

42:43.160 --> 42:44.200
How are the kids?

42:44.200 --> 42:45.480
Nonsense like that.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.040
But he's not having it.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.960
I'm talking minimal answers.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.480
I don't want to be the best friends with the guy,

42:51.480 --> 42:54.040
but I would like to know we can get along in my workplace.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.680
Is there another way to gouge if Gage-

42:56.680 --> 42:57.160
Wow.

42:57.160 --> 42:57.660
Sorry.

42:58.760 --> 42:59.960
Is there another way to gouge?

43:00.760 --> 43:01.800
Is there a gouge?

43:02.360 --> 43:03.800
Is there a gouge to work?

43:04.600 --> 43:07.000
Is there a gouge to see if we're gonna work well together?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.920
Can I trick him into being my work pal?

43:08.920 --> 43:13.480
Or is it already effed and I should quit while I'm ahead?

43:13.480 --> 43:13.980
Ugh.

43:14.920 --> 43:18.360
Well, I mean, the obvious answer is some kind of whimsic old buddy road trip.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.560
Somewhere you learn a lot about each other,

43:21.560 --> 43:22.840
but a lot about yourself, Stu.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.720
Do a full New England Applebee's tour.

43:27.720 --> 43:29.400
Can you try to give him an organ?

43:29.400 --> 43:32.440
Like, does he need an organ or maybe he wants a backup organ?

43:32.440 --> 43:34.840
Or try to steal one of his organs and then, like,

43:34.840 --> 43:36.840
blackmail him to be friends with you to get it back.

43:36.840 --> 43:37.480
These are all-

43:37.480 --> 43:38.040
That's pretty good.

43:38.040 --> 43:39.720
Tremendous suggestions.

43:41.720 --> 43:41.960
I don't-

43:41.960 --> 43:45.480
I haven't worked in an office since I was fucking 17 years old.

43:46.360 --> 43:47.160
So if you-

43:47.160 --> 43:48.680
Oh, I do a Jimmy Buffett.

43:48.680 --> 43:49.080
Jesus.

43:49.080 --> 43:49.880
If you would count-

43:50.440 --> 43:52.280
It don't even mention that dude's name.

43:52.280 --> 43:53.000
Listen, everyone.

43:53.000 --> 43:53.880
It happened again.

43:54.840 --> 43:59.160
We ate a pound of shit from people by offending them.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.480
First, it was jugglers.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.920
And then it was Jimmy Buffett fans.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.280
We did it again.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.640
Didn't think that there was that big of an audience.

44:07.640 --> 44:09.320
Big audience for that, but apparently-

44:09.320 --> 44:10.920
I think they prefer paired heads.

44:11.960 --> 44:13.720
And also, I like Jimmy Buffetts.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.320
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.800
I'm going to do a live edition of Boat Drinks when we go to New York.

44:19.800 --> 44:20.440
Oh, fuck that.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.720
So let me bring me a guitar so I can-

44:21.720 --> 44:23.480
You can do that during the Justin show.

44:23.480 --> 44:28.200
What I'm saying is I don't think you can make anyone be your friend under any circumstances.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.680
Like, especially if you're fucking working together.

44:30.680 --> 44:31.720
But why do you give a shit?

44:32.600 --> 44:33.320
Well, here's the thing.

44:33.320 --> 44:37.880
I'm going to draw some knowledge that in your question, you gave me the hint.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.320
I need to solve this problem.

44:39.320 --> 44:43.560
When you say that you ask him how it's going and how are the kids and nonsense like that,

44:44.360 --> 44:48.040
that says to me that you're clearly not interested in his answers.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.040
You're just trying to gauge if he likes you or not.

44:50.600 --> 44:55.000
And that's going to come across as really insincere and that's not very likable.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.640
I would say you should be interested in him and ask questions you want to know the answers to.

44:59.640 --> 45:04.760
Travis is echoing the sentiments of Uncle Dale, Carnegie that is.

45:04.760 --> 45:10.120
The only way to make friends is to get genuinely accent on that word.

45:10.120 --> 45:12.760
They're interested in other people.

45:12.760 --> 45:18.440
If you're not actually interested and you're just like saying platitudes or idle chit chat

45:18.440 --> 45:22.440
for chit chat sake, then it's not going to build an actual relationship.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.440
You got to get actually interested in the guy.

45:24.440 --> 45:28.040
And if he's not, you know, if he's not interesting, then find something.

45:28.040 --> 45:30.360
Everybody's got something that's interesting about them.

45:30.360 --> 45:31.880
Find something, get interested in it.

45:31.880 --> 45:34.840
And that's the only real way to build a friendship like that.

45:34.840 --> 45:37.640
And then once you started that, then you drop some negs.

45:39.480 --> 45:39.880
Got it.

45:39.880 --> 45:40.680
A few negs.

45:42.680 --> 45:44.760
I mean, also keep in mind he's your boss.

45:44.760 --> 45:47.320
Like you don't have to be friends.

45:47.320 --> 45:50.920
Of course, everybody wants to be liked and everybody wants to be on good terms with people.

45:50.920 --> 45:55.160
But like so you guys aren't like best friends going to see movies on the weekends together.

45:55.160 --> 46:00.440
So what, he's your boss and it's a professional relationship more than anything else.

46:00.440 --> 46:01.560
So that's probably okay.

46:01.560 --> 46:04.040
Just make sure he doesn't hate you.

46:04.040 --> 46:07.800
The only reason to be friends with your boss is so you can get away with more shit.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.920
And I think bosses know that full well.

46:11.880 --> 46:13.160
So their hearts are hardened.

46:14.040 --> 46:14.600
You got to break through.

46:14.600 --> 46:16.520
They're so cold and dead inside.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.600
You got to genuinely like this guy first.

46:18.600 --> 46:26.200
You have to genuinely like this person and get actually, actually interested in this person.

46:27.320 --> 46:30.840
But that's the only way that you're going to actually make a relationship.

46:30.840 --> 46:31.640
That's what you want to do.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.160
I don't know what to add to this.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.400
No, we nailed it.

46:37.400 --> 46:37.640
Yeah.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.000
I mean, got it at one.

46:39.960 --> 46:40.760
Y'all want a Yahoo?

46:41.480 --> 46:41.880
Please.

46:43.080 --> 46:45.480
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

46:45.480 --> 46:51.000
It is asked by, and now that field isn't even loading.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.400
Hey, Yahoo Answers, you did a great job on your website.

46:54.440 --> 46:55.240
You did a real good job.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.000
You brought in some real experts.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.800
It's like fucking healthcare.gov all over again.

46:59.800 --> 47:03.800
I feel like all signs are pointing to us needing to abandon Yahoo Answers.

47:03.800 --> 47:11.000
Like not only is Yahoo dropping the ball, but everybody decided that like, oh, these are like,

47:11.000 --> 47:16.840
oh, these are like every week I see, and there was a guy on like BuzzFeed this week.

47:16.840 --> 47:20.280
It's like, you'll love this guy's hilarious Yahoo Answers responses.

47:20.280 --> 47:24.120
Like, yeah, hi, is it 2010 again or no?

47:24.120 --> 47:24.440
Okay.

47:24.440 --> 47:26.120
He's pretty late to the party.

47:26.120 --> 47:28.920
This, this, this field has been mined.

47:29.720 --> 47:30.280
By us.

47:30.920 --> 47:31.800
By us.

47:31.800 --> 47:32.280
It's done.

47:32.280 --> 47:32.680
We straight mined it.

47:32.680 --> 47:37.960
We came in, we gave the farmer $10 for the ore within his land, and he was like,

47:37.960 --> 47:42.040
oh, I've got $10 and then we've taken all of it and left his fields fallow.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.600
We salted the earth.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.880
Now, I mean, there's still people.

47:47.880 --> 47:53.880
There's some fucking shamans, some Yahoo shamans out there doing spiritual work, reviving,

47:54.680 --> 47:56.600
reviving the lands, the mother earth.

47:57.160 --> 48:01.880
Drew Davenport is a level six shaman and he speaks directly to comedy Gaia

48:01.880 --> 48:05.800
and he gets a lot of product out of this, this fallow field.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.120
Now what do you find in this fallow ass field?

48:08.120 --> 48:09.640
Uh, thank you, Drew.

48:09.640 --> 48:12.120
I can't tell you who fucking asked it because this website won't load.

48:12.120 --> 48:14.920
So I'm going to say it was asked by Drew Davenport.

48:15.880 --> 48:21.000
Who asks, is stuffing shoes with socks noticeable?

48:21.960 --> 48:26.200
I stuffed my shoes with socks daily to give me a bit of extra height.

48:26.200 --> 48:32.520
It's not uncomfortable walking, but sometimes I notice I walk like one of my legs are sore.

48:32.520 --> 48:37.480
It adds about two inches to my shoe height, making me almost 5'11 with shoes on.

48:37.960 --> 48:42.200
I always get the impression people are looking at me and I am constantly looking behind me.

48:42.200 --> 48:46.600
My friend is about 5'8 and he uses regular insoles to make him 5'10.

48:46.600 --> 48:47.720
We are both 16.

48:48.680 --> 48:49.320
What?

48:49.320 --> 48:53.000
People noticed before and I was so embarrassed they were mocking me for days in school,

48:53.000 --> 48:54.440
but despite this, I still do it.

48:55.240 --> 48:55.800
What?

48:55.800 --> 49:01.160
I guess, first of all, you asked a question about whether it was noticeable

49:01.160 --> 49:03.560
and instead people noticed it in front of you.

49:04.440 --> 49:05.800
So, yes.

49:05.800 --> 49:09.400
Can someone help me through the actual procedure?

49:09.400 --> 49:10.600
I'm having trouble parsing this.

49:10.600 --> 49:15.720
What kind of shoes are you wearing that there's an extra like two inches in there?

49:15.720 --> 49:18.120
Two inches of space in there.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.440
What kind of shoes are we talking about?

49:22.440 --> 49:24.200
This is obviously clown school, right?

49:25.320 --> 49:26.600
It's Stomper's school.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.280
Stomper's University.

49:28.280 --> 49:32.840
When I put just like normal like arch support insoles in my shoes,

49:32.840 --> 49:34.920
I noticed it's a little tight.

49:34.920 --> 49:38.120
That's like an eighth of an inch of material.

49:38.120 --> 49:38.360
Yeah.

49:39.240 --> 49:42.040
I don't know if this person is talking about wearing a lot of socks

49:42.040 --> 49:48.280
or if they just put the socks under where their foot goes in the shoe cavity,

49:50.120 --> 49:50.840
in the shoe hole.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.720
I don't think this person knows how big an inch is.

49:53.720 --> 49:54.760
That's the only thing that makes sense.

49:54.760 --> 49:55.000
Yeah.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.960
Yeah, I have to amount to two inches.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.200
That's significant.

50:00.200 --> 50:01.640
That's Frankenstein shoes.

50:01.640 --> 50:01.880
Yeah.

50:02.520 --> 50:07.160
Unless you have lifts and those go like under the like in the sole.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.440
I am upset.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.720
It's a special shoes.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.200
Hey, do you guys remember Forrest Gump?

50:19.000 --> 50:22.440
It's been a long time since America's consciousness has thought about that fool.

50:22.440 --> 50:26.840
Hey, I'm re-released that on Blu-ray.

50:26.840 --> 50:27.800
Travis, I got some.

50:28.520 --> 50:29.160
Check this out.

50:29.960 --> 50:30.520
Okay.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.320
Check this out.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.360
Shrimp.

50:34.360 --> 50:34.840
Nice.

50:39.080 --> 50:40.040
I got one for you.

50:40.040 --> 50:40.360
How about that?

50:40.360 --> 50:40.760
Wait, hold on.

50:40.760 --> 50:41.560
I got one.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.080
I got no legs, Forrest.

50:43.080 --> 50:43.800
Okay.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.960
Well, I don't get that one.

50:45.960 --> 50:46.920
My legs are gone.

50:47.480 --> 50:47.960
What is that?

50:47.960 --> 50:49.080
I'm a lieutenant.

50:49.080 --> 50:52.840
Oh.

50:52.840 --> 50:54.200
I'm Lieutenant Daniel.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.680
I'm Lieutenant Daniel.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.320
Sergeant Daniel.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.120
The UK Forrest Gump has a silent U in his name.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.000
Magic shoes.

51:06.760 --> 51:07.320
Crikey.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.360
Get your magic shoes here, guv.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.120
Seats taken, guv.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.160
I got boiled prawns.

51:17.160 --> 51:20.280
I got stewed fried prawns.

51:20.280 --> 51:21.720
Butter battered prawns.

51:23.320 --> 51:24.680
Jellied prawns.

51:25.320 --> 51:27.240
Salt caked prawns.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.640
Farm raised prawns.

51:32.680 --> 51:33.880
Herched prawns.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.680
Come on out to my pruning board, Forrest.

51:41.080 --> 51:41.800
Forrest.

51:41.800 --> 51:45.320
Forrest Gump.

51:49.320 --> 51:50.920
Oh, god.

51:50.920 --> 51:52.440
Can I tell you something about that movie?

51:52.440 --> 51:54.280
Can I tell you something about British Forrest Gump?

51:54.280 --> 51:58.440
Sally Fields would still be in it, and she would still be fucking transcendent.

51:59.080 --> 52:00.680
She would still be incredible.

52:02.600 --> 52:03.160
Fuck me.

52:04.040 --> 52:04.760
Oh, man.

52:05.480 --> 52:06.760
Stupid magic shoes.

52:06.760 --> 52:07.320
Dumb show.

52:07.960 --> 52:09.160
Dumb, dumb, dumb show.

52:09.160 --> 52:13.880
Uh, thank you so much for listening to our, uh, to our podcast.

52:13.880 --> 52:16.280
My brother, my brother and me, we hope you had a good time.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.720
Some fun, some laughs.

52:17.720 --> 52:23.480
Um, thank you so much to people tweeting about the show with the MB, MB, AM hashtag

52:23.480 --> 52:31.080
like Jordan, Paul, Blistifer, Fenton's dad, BTA, Schmoozy, Sir Bunnington, uh,

52:31.080 --> 52:40.920
uh, Louisa Heron, Don Chapel, uh, comedy podcasts, Sarah the cat, Austin Grismore,

52:40.920 --> 52:41.880
and many, many others.

52:42.920 --> 52:48.200
Were you just being, were you being generic then and just like thanking comedy podcasts?

52:48.200 --> 52:51.480
No, that's an actual, we've talked about comedy podcasts before.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.320
The Twitter account, comedy podcasts.

52:54.120 --> 52:58.760
Thanks, everybody's already started sending in, uh, emails and questions for the live shows.

52:58.760 --> 53:05.400
Although, uh, I would stress that when you send them in, don't just put question for

53:05.400 --> 53:06.360
the live show.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.280
We're doing three of them.

53:08.280 --> 53:11.400
People, please specify which one you're going to be at.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.960
Um, I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song

53:15.960 --> 53:18.600
instead of departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

53:19.160 --> 53:21.640
Great little album, a lot of great tunes, a lot of great tracks.

53:21.640 --> 53:29.000
I suggest listening to track, uh, four and six and nine are my personal favorites.

53:30.280 --> 53:38.040
Um, I want to remind everybody that, uh, there are still plenty of, uh, fantastic seats or

53:38.040 --> 53:46.120
I guess cabins available for the, uh, for the Atlantic ocean comedy and music festival

53:46.120 --> 53:48.120
at boat party dot biz.

53:48.120 --> 53:55.240
Uh, they, uh, had just announced that they added Tony Cayman, Carol Kolb, Guy Branham

53:55.240 --> 53:57.560
and James Adamian.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.280
Adamian?

53:58.280 --> 53:59.480
That sounds right.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.160
Yeah, I'm going to go with that.

54:01.160 --> 54:04.680
Uh, and they already had said that, uh, Chris Fairbanks is going to be there.

54:04.680 --> 54:09.880
Moshe Kasher, Kyle Kinane, Morgan Murphy, like, and John Roderick, which you might remember

54:09.880 --> 54:11.000
from 30 seconds ago.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.040
It's going to be huge.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.560
It's going to be a lot of fun.

54:13.560 --> 54:17.080
Uh, there's going to be comedy and there's going to be music and it's going to make you

54:17.080 --> 54:21.560
really, really happy because you're going to set sail from port Canaveral and spend

54:21.560 --> 54:26.840
three nights in the Bahamas, July 25th, 28th at boat party dot biz.

54:26.840 --> 54:27.400
Sounds terrible.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.200
Who'd want to do that?

54:28.760 --> 54:29.320
Catch it.

54:29.960 --> 54:33.800
I want to say thanks again to our friends at nature box, um, where you can get a box

54:33.800 --> 54:37.400

Griffin, do you have a last question?

54:58.520 --> 55:04.120
I do have a final one that you can chew on appropriate for reasons you'll understand

55:04.120 --> 55:04.920
here in a second.

55:04.920 --> 55:07.720
I'm just saying that what you just said is appropriate to the subject matter of the

55:07.720 --> 55:08.120
question.

55:08.840 --> 55:11.880
So it's kind of funny how life works out sometimes, isn't it?

It is funny.

You said chew on it and then beef jerky is like sort of a sinewy shoot.
