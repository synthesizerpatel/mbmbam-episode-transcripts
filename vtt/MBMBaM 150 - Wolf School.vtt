WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
One, two, three, four!

00:02.000 --> 00:07.000
My brother and Elrod and me

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Have a rare, have a radio station you see

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
We try to give people some simplicity

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
To understand their problems endlessly

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
We try to be solvers of problems

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And solutions to them

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
We try to give them hope and encouraging again and again

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
That they will get wisdom and understanding

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We try to see the sunset at the end of a storm

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
When things are torn

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
We try to help people find out

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Solutions not problems all about

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
We are psych psychologists

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Giving people the best through their impressions

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
We try to understand the world

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Just like a guy tries to understand his girl

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Hey, everybody, welcome! Gosh!

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
What an honor to be here at the Washington, D.C. Press Corps Correspondence Dinner.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Man, wow. Filling in for Conan and O'Brien at the last minute is a lot of pressure.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Especially since they had to get three people to do it.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, and we're all huddled around this microphone.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Let's just, let me try the mic.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Go ahead.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Let's just start out with this.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Hey, New York Post, you're a bunch of racist pieces of shit.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
And everything about your fucking shit rag sucks bloody cocks.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Fuck you guys to death.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Good one.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
My farts that come out of my butt are better journalists than you real human beings.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
You giant fuck holes.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
That's pretty good.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Let's try something political.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Maybe a little lighter, Griff.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, okay.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Keep up with the politicians.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah, just one real quick for the Fox News Correspondence.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I hope all your kids have diarrhea to death.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh, wow.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
That's just where I'm at right now.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Do you have one for like any, maybe like maybe you want to roast a politician?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh, sure, sure.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I've got one for basically every congressman.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
All that stuff I said about Fox goes for you too.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
I ran out of stuff because really once you wish dysentery,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
once you wish like the 10th plague on a group of people,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
you can't really get much worse than that.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay, great.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, okay, I see we are getting the wrap up sign.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Thank you so much.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Thanks.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Fuck everyone here.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Thanks.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Thank you.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Can I get this to go?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
No.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
No.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
You don't have any boxes or anything?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Anderson Cooper, you're okay.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Wolf Blitzer, you're on fucking thin ice dog.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
You goofed the Boston stuff.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
That's all.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
That's usually really solid.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
But you goofed all the Boston stuff.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
So I'm Justin McElroy.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Sorry for the harsh words.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
I had a great bit about Senator Lindsey Graham having a woman's first name.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
That was actually the joke.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
That was not a bit.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Was it the dick pic guy?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
He tweeted a dick pic?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Who was the dick pic guy?

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Lindsey Graham is the one who hates all goodness and purity in the world.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't know.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Probably got teased a lot for having a girl's name.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I'm talking about Tony Weiner, who recently just got back on Twitter,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
and his first tweet since getting back on Twitter.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
His last tweet before this tweet was,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
looks like I got hacked or something.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Super didn't get hacked.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Unless the hacker had intimate log-ins.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
And his first tweet back was an at mention of his own name.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And that was the entire contents of Twitter.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Good job on Twitter, Tony.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Doing pretty good on Twitter so far.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Tone.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Tone.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Tone Love.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
This is my brother.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
My brother made an advice show for the modern era.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
We could have taken questions, Griffin.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I don't know why you had to be so aggressive.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Everyone fucked up.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Everyone fucked right up.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
At the dinner or just in general?

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
If both the press and politicians could maybe take the night off

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
from goofily zinging each other and just like,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
maybe do one thing right instead of that.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Maybe just do a thing right.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Can I be honest with you guys?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Hit me.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
I realize now I made that joke about can I get this to go.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Do they actually eat dinner at the Correspondents' Dinner?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I don't know anything about it,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
but I imagine it's a pretty good spread, right?

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
They had halibut and filet mignon.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Like at the same time?

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, they baked a filet mignon inside of a halibut.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
And we got people starving on the street while they eat fish steaks?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
It's not right.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Everything's wrong about it.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Good job fucking up, guys.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Here's some halibut.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
This isn't how Benny Franklin would have done it.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
President Ben Franklin.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Our greatest president.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
I feel like we've joked about Ben Franklin being president before.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I think we've joked about Ben Franklin.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
That's not because we're unoriginal.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
It's because we're fucking dummies.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Because we're idiot children.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Let's help people.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
That would be our penance.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
My fiancÃ© and I want to get married.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Problem, it's expensive.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Not to mention the hassle.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Starting to think we should ditch the big ceremony reception ordeal

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
and just elope someplace nice.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Is there any way we could get away with that without being disowned?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
That's from marrying in merryland.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
In this day and age, eloping just means going to the courthouse.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
He's not climbing to your window and you're sneaking off on a night.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
What Travis and I are doing has become the counterculture.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
A courthouse wedding is, I feel like, the norm.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
I feel like 96% of people do that.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Not an exaggeration.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
I think about half the people I am friends with have been married in a non-ceremony.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
That's an anomaly because it's usually closer to 96, like I said.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Sure, right.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I don't have all the numbers in front of me.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
What Travis and I are doing is adhering to some archaic ceremony.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
It's a ritual.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
It's like a blood ritual.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Do you know what I mean?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
It's practically aboriginal in nature.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
I am very cautious now when we talk about marriage.

06:26.000 --> 06:35.000
Because the last time we addressed ceremonies that are perhaps on their way out,

06:35.000 --> 06:48.000
we talked about the preponderance of people where the man asks the woman's parents for their daughter's hand in marriage.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
And oh manzies, there are some people who that irritates.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
A man alive, that was a booby old firestorm.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
What were people irritated by?

07:00.000 --> 07:12.000
That apparently our West Virginia values are not good enough for urban, hint hint wink wink, America, I think.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
I don't understand what urban wink wink means.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Urban, you know.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Urban.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
And Keith Urban.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
We got a lot of emails from Keith Urban.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I did that.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
He's not Australian.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
He is.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Wait, is he?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
He is.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I did that.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
I asked Rachel's parents for permission.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
And I know Travis did something similar by which I mean he asked Teresa to ask for him.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yep.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Is that not a good thing to do?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I think it is.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I think that apparently it really made people mad.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I think there's a better way we could have phrased it.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
I think if you talk to, I think the way we specifically addressed it was asking a dad for his daughter's hand in marriage.

07:59.000 --> 08:08.000
I think the preferred sort of approach now is maybe talking to her parents beforehand and letting your intentions be known.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
So it doesn't completely catch them by the willy.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Before we actually help this person, I think the problem.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
No, this is tied in.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I think it's all sort of tied together.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
I think the issue is the image of asking for or the appearance of it being asking for the daughter.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Right.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
That was not how I.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
I think that is what seems sexist because you're saying like, hey, may I take your property?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yes, you may.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I think it's more of a discussion.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I didn't frame it like that.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
There was no exchange of wampum.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
Like I just said, hey, I'm going to do this thing if that's cool.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Is that all right with you?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Is that cool with you?

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And they actually their actual response was I didn't think people did this anymore.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
They were grateful, but they were they were startled.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Please take back your crates of beads and blankets.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
I wrote up actually on one of those bicycles where the front wheel is like enormous.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
It was a it was a very kitschy pre-proposal.

09:02.000 --> 09:11.000
I think that you've hit the nail on the head, question asker, because I think that at least a lot of people that I talk to that still do the big weddings,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
especially as it gets close to the crunch time of the actual ceremony.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
And they're like, oh, my God, it would be so much easier if we just went to the courthouse and got it over with.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Usually it has something to do with.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
But my family would kill me, you know, which is never a reason to do anything.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
But like it is something it is a factor that should weigh on your mind.

09:32.000 --> 09:43.000
I will say this, though, if you don't do the big ceremony reception, which I get and I understand that, don't ask like don't ask for gifts.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I think those two are pretty well tied together.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
Well, I don't know unless it's like you frame it like a payoff for making them not have to get on a plane.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Like I am making you not fly here in return.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
How about two blenders?

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
What if you only sent out invites and save the dates to people you knew couldn't make it,

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
and then you didn't have a reception or ceremony and just got the presents?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Huh, huh, OK.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I'm actually happy, which I mean, it is a long con.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
This is a grift.

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
This is a grift with what I would classify as a relatively high possibility of being completely fucked.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
It's going to turn into a movie because your great aunt that lives in Hawaii is going to show up

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
and you're going to have to stage the whole thing last minute.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeah, exactly.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I don't know.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
We started out thinking that we were going to get out of ours on a dime.

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
And boy, oh, Chef Boyardee, who are we wrong about that price tag?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Who?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I think that's true.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I think of everyone because I like Teresa and I thought we are going to reinvent the wedding.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
You know what I mean?

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
You guys haven't been through this yet.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
What I would say to this question asker is I understand the expense is an issue.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
I do think that there are some clever ways to sort of handle that in a way that really makes sense for you.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
You can personalize.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
There are no rules.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Just right.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Weddings are like the outback.

11:15.000 --> 11:26.000
What I would say to you is that day where we had all of our friends and family in one room sort of seeing us off,

11:26.000 --> 11:35.000
as it were, on this metaphorical journey that is marriage, that day means a lot to me.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
Remembering that day and thinking back on it, it makes me feel really entwined with all the people that were there.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Is that a memory?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
I wouldn't trade that day for anything.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Now, of course, I did minimal planning.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
It didn't pay for mine.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
A lot of the specialness, maybe it's like Christmas.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Christmas is much more magical when you don't have to reduce any of the magic yourself.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
But once you get into the price per memory ratio, is that memory a 15 large memory for you?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Because that's some total recall shit.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
That's some come into the memory sphere.

12:09.000 --> 12:19.000
This will cost you 20 million credits to remember the time that you fucked an octopus.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
What?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Ink me.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Ink me, you whore.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Ink me.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Octopuses don't have whores, so squids.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
What?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Octopuses don't have ink.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Did I say whore?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Yep.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Octopus is a very moral creature.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
It is.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
That's why you got to pay 20 million space credits to simulate the octopus anyway.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
You guys want Yahoo?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah, I guess.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Thank you, Ira Ray.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
It's by Yahoo Answers.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Are you Ira Ray?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Who wants to know?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
We did it.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
We did it.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
We did the set up.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
We did the call and response.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Now the bit can die.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Now the bit is dead forever.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Goodbye, bit.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Goodbye, bit.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Have a good run.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
This is asked by Yahoo Answers user SP, who asks, how do I find my place in the circle

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
of life?

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
How do I find my place in the, quote, circle of life, like Mufasa told Simba to?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I feel like I've forgotten who I am.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
What does it mean to find your place in the circle of life?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
And also, what does it mean to know who you are?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Good question.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
My Spain, your money.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
That's step one.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
Have you guys heard Travis's one-man Ladysmith Black Mombasa cover band?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
It's called Ladysmith Black Travis.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Keep going.

13:33.000 --> 13:42.000
I like this question so much because he asks how to do these things, and then he follows

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
that up with, by the way, what are these things?

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
I think if your dad didn't hold you up over a cliff when you were born.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Oh my god.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
That was, I feel like there was 1990, what do you think?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Go on.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
You were doing really good.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
94, 95.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
With the sun rolling high.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Stop, stop.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
In the sapphire sky.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
It was definitely the I'm king of the world of neonatal dads.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
Every neonatal doctor in the fucking biz, from like 1995 to 1996, every dad, he would

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
be like, oh, good.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah, like the movie, like the Lion King film, the animated motion picture that came out.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Even Michael Jackson got in on that trend, and we crucified him for it.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Well, he did it wrong.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
He did it wrong.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
No, he didn't do it wrong.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
He did it big, just the way MJ did everything, Travis.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
He didn't, though, because he fucking covered the bit.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
He didn't proudly hang him over the edge and let people take, he just very briefly was

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
like, he did it in the creepiest way possible.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
He's like, just go and dangle this little baby, toast, bye.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
That's all he did.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
He's the worst, except his music was so good.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I'm conflicted now.

14:52.000 --> 15:01.000
Like, I think the literal way is you fucking jump into the zoo pen and get eaten by a lion,

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
and then that lion poops, and it grows grass that a buffalo eats, and then you're inside

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
the buffalo.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
I think the good news for this question asker is I doubt very much that on your deathbed,

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
somebody whispers to you like, by the way, you were supposed to be an astronaut.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
What a wonderful service that would be.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
You blew it.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
You blew it.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
You blew it.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
Just before you go, before your light flickers and dies, I just want you to know, you got

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
a married Heidi Klum.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Let's tear open the envelope.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Ah, fuck.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
I can't wait to see this.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I can tell you what it doesn't say.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
It does not say quickie lube attendant.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
You have done fucked up.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Now, what is the alternative?

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
The alternative is that some people have somehow jumped the track and have gotten your spot.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
It's like, oh shit, you were supposed to be a quickie lube attendant, Mr. President.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Nice work.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
How'd you jump that?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I mean, where is your place?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Like, what?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
What is it?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
All right.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Let's start.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
What's the circle of life?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Question my question.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Circle of life.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Are we talking about food chain?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Are we talking about photosynthesis?

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
I think it's the life death circle, the endless circle that is life and death.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Well, now we're talking about so many different things.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Are we talking about reanimation?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
That's not what it's called.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Oh, Jesus.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Reanimation.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
That fucks up the circle of life right good, though, doesn't it?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Yeah.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Are we talking about zombies?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
No.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That's the figurative life.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Because then it's the Mobius strip of life.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I mean, we're at the top of the food chain.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
There's not much.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
And that's why it's such an insult when one of us gets eaten by an animal, because it's

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
like, ugh.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
What are you doing?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
We're better than that, you know?

16:44.000 --> 16:48.660
If I could balance that out whenever somebody gets mauled by an animal, I eat a lion.

16:48.660 --> 16:53.400
Just to keep it all on the list and let them know what's up.

16:53.400 --> 16:57.120
Why aren't one of the three of us like a mad hunter?

16:57.120 --> 17:04.000
Why aren't one of the three of us like a general czar-of-esque, like ivory for days?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Why?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.880
I mean, there's probably a lot of reasons.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.200
If you we get a lot of people asking us, you know, will you guys come out and do a live

17:13.200 --> 17:15.800
show in our area?

17:15.800 --> 17:23.560
And the answer is always no, unless you can arrange some sort of hunt where we get to

17:23.560 --> 17:30.480
shoot something beautiful and perfect and hopefully from the Lion King.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.920
Now I want to be clear here.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.880
I love animals.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.000
Me too.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.640
And so I don't want any of those PETA guys calling me.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.480
I just want to kill one.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.480
You just want to kill one.

17:41.480 --> 17:42.480
Yeah.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.480
One of each.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.480
There's nothing wrong with that.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.480
And let me tell you this.

17:45.480 --> 17:49.480
You better have some trim on hand, because I'm going to be fucking rock ready to go.

17:49.480 --> 17:53.880
I want to, I want to like kill something and eat its heart to get its power, right?

17:53.880 --> 17:55.560
So that I'm really potent.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.560
You know what I mean?

17:56.560 --> 17:57.560
Sure.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.560
Like a Mega Man boss.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.560
Yes.

17:59.560 --> 18:03.040
Now I have legs of an antelope.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.040
Sprawling.

18:04.040 --> 18:10.560
Kermit, are you saying to me that if you killed an animal from the Lion King, you would become

18:10.560 --> 18:11.560
rock hard?

18:11.560 --> 18:12.560
That's what you're saying to me right now.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.560
One bigger than me.

18:13.560 --> 18:18.600
You remember when GoDaddy killed that elephant and we were like, boo GoDaddy.

18:18.600 --> 18:27.440
But then at the same time you think about like, that guy has to be stiff till November.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.080
And just imagine that, but if it was a person.

18:31.080 --> 18:35.120
Now listen, are we talking hypotheticals or?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
Always on this show.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.120
Okay.

18:37.120 --> 18:41.720
I'm going to say first, if you're a police officer, you legally have to stop listening.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.000
If you're a police officer, you have to tell us.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.680
Also we're going to talk about Lost Spoilers, so unless you want to know what happened.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.640
If you have not watched Lost or you're a law enforcement officer.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.600
Or both, God forbid.

18:55.600 --> 19:02.080
Um, I, that's, I don't know Justin, you're getting into uncomfortable territory for me.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.800
Hunting people is uncomfortable?

19:03.800 --> 19:04.880
I would never hunt.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.200
I don't think I can do it.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.000
I feel bad when I would never do it.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.480
Although I do remember when kids used to get out of school in Huntington because hunting

19:11.480 --> 19:13.240
season, the first day of hunting season.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.760
Well, I mean, it wasn't called fucking Macromayton was it?

19:17.760 --> 19:20.560
It wasn't called Paintington was it?

19:20.560 --> 19:21.560
No.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.560
Nope.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.560
Sure wasn't called that.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.560
It wasn't called Skateboard Town.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.040
It was not called Skateboard Town.

19:26.040 --> 19:30.240
So, I don't know what to tell you.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.240
Mathsburg.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.880
Here, where all the kids do math for fun.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.620
I've been dating this wonderful girl for three months now and things are going great.

19:37.620 --> 19:38.620
I'm like half.

19:38.620 --> 19:39.620
I'm like a sentence in.

19:39.620 --> 19:40.620
I'm bored of this question.

19:40.620 --> 19:41.620
Alrighty.

19:41.620 --> 19:42.620
No, it gets good.

19:42.620 --> 19:44.000
I hope there's some conflict.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
We're finishing up our first year of school and making plans for when we return in September.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.960
We both lived in the dorms this year and would like to live off campus in the fall.

19:51.960 --> 19:56.920
But the thing is she's dead set on living in a house together with four of our friends.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.920
This seems like a big leap for such a new relationship.

19:58.920 --> 20:03.200
I've explained to her, but she insists we will have each have our own space and there'll

20:03.200 --> 20:05.440
be four other people living there.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.120
If we're not really moving in together, I shouldn't worry about it.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.480
Am I wrong for being hesitant?

20:10.480 --> 20:12.640
I don't want to miss out on what could be a fun experience.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.760
I just know if we break up, it'll make the next year we're stuck together completely

20:15.760 --> 20:16.760
miserable.

20:16.760 --> 20:17.760
That's from Cautious in California.

20:17.760 --> 20:22.760
Get out of the way.

20:22.760 --> 20:29.440
Slow-mo diving in front of you right now.

20:29.440 --> 20:33.520
That's me putting my head underneath the pin that you're going to put.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.640
I don't care if it stabs through my brain and kills me.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.640
You have to not.

20:36.640 --> 20:37.640
I know.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.920
I'm going to tell you this straight up.

20:38.920 --> 20:43.880
Look at your girlfriend and say, honey, this is worse than if we are just living in together.

20:43.880 --> 20:50.560
It is literally the worst situation that you could be in because here's what you're piling

20:50.560 --> 20:51.560
on top, right?

20:51.560 --> 20:56.220
So these other people you have to get used to living with six people in the same house.

20:56.220 --> 20:57.920
Like that's Bummerton.

20:57.920 --> 21:02.140
I don't know how big this house is, but we've got a huge company house that our actors stay

21:02.140 --> 21:06.800
in and there's six people there and like it just breeds the occasional fight because you're

21:06.800 --> 21:09.200
sharing bathrooms, you're sharing living spaces.

21:09.200 --> 21:14.800
Plus, if you and your girlfriend have fights, the rest of the thing has to deal with it

21:14.800 --> 21:16.280
or one and vice versa.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.280
Yeah.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.280
Like necking on the couch.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.840
They're like, oh, God, again.

21:20.840 --> 21:21.840
They don't want to.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.840
They don't.

21:22.840 --> 21:27.600
They're trying to watch Lost and you're trying to make you're trying to make fuck juice and

21:27.600 --> 21:29.120
they don't want to see that.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.800
While they're finding out that the polar bear is escaped from a research facility.

21:32.800 --> 21:33.800
Yeah.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.800
That's spoilers.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.520
We did warn you ahead of time, to be fair.

21:38.520 --> 21:42.620
I just think that three months is wicked soon to move in with somebody.

21:42.620 --> 21:47.200
Even if your shit is going perfect, moving in like living, especially if your shit is

21:47.200 --> 21:48.200
going perfect.

21:48.200 --> 21:52.200
Now, counterargument, Teresa and I moved in together after three months.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.280
You were obviously meant to be the one that was the difference because we literally had

21:55.280 --> 21:56.280
the conversation.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.920
If we're going to move in together, are we going to get married?

21:58.920 --> 22:03.760
Jesus obviously molded both of you from dust to be each other's partners into infinity.

22:03.760 --> 22:04.760
Obviously.

22:04.760 --> 22:05.760
Yeah.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.880
So I guess if you put at no point did I ever worry about breaking up with her.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.440
Not that I'm saying there's anything wrong with your relationship, because I think that's

22:12.440 --> 22:15.200
perfectly normal to think about when you're a freshman in college and you've only been

22:15.200 --> 22:17.440
dating someone for three months and they want to sign a lease.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.360
So I'm just saying that it's probably very smart of you.

22:21.360 --> 22:25.520
Very logical of you to say, honey, we're only nineteen and we've only been dating three

22:25.520 --> 22:26.840
months.

22:26.840 --> 22:30.600
Let's just live in the same apartment building if that's the way you want to go with us.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.380
Even that is fucking a tall grass like the weirdest.

22:34.380 --> 22:37.440
The important thing, though, is separate leases.

22:37.440 --> 22:42.680
If you move in with somebody after three months of dating, I personally think that's a little

22:42.680 --> 22:43.680
fast.

22:43.680 --> 22:49.480
But if you are fucked up, Travis, like, sorry, Jeff, but if you're dead set on it.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.480
But no, I'm Travis.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
It was a risk.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.520
And you came out on the winning end.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.080
I'm saying that could break bad.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.280
Oh, God, yes.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.640
What if you have turned out to be a huge dick, Travis?

22:59.640 --> 23:00.640
Like what?

23:00.640 --> 23:01.640
I know.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.640
I know.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.640
Because I know.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.640
What if she had realized?

23:04.640 --> 23:05.640
Right.

23:05.640 --> 23:06.640
I know it wasn't going to be Teresa.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.640
That fuck that deal.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.640
Angel.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.640
Yeah.

23:09.640 --> 23:15.040
But if you like living with other people is not.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.040
We've talked about this before.

23:16.040 --> 23:21.000
I feel like ad nauseum, but living with other people that you're not dating is like the

23:21.000 --> 23:26.120
pits and you could get to a point where, like, you need out and you're that is going to be

23:26.120 --> 23:27.560
tough on your relationship.

23:27.560 --> 23:30.440
If one of you like hates the situation, the other one doesn't.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.960
That's going to be a lot of strain.

23:31.960 --> 23:37.680
I feel like the situation is going to put a lot of unnecessary strain on on on you guys

23:37.680 --> 23:41.640
unless unless let me hit you with this.

23:41.640 --> 23:46.080
It's a new it's a new reality show that I'm thinking about pitching to the Fox reality

23:46.080 --> 23:47.080
network.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.640
They still in operation does not exist.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.640
Go on.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.640
It's not functional.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.640
Solitary.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.640
Put him out of business.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.640
I just started watching that show.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.640
Yeah.

23:55.640 --> 23:56.640
It's Rachel.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.640
Fuck it.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.640
It is a show.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.640
It's on Hulu.

23:59.640 --> 24:00.640
It's on Hulu.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.640
Yeah.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.640
Is it?

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
It's finally my Hulu plus subscription.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
It doesn't stream to consoles.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.640
Sorry.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.640
Hit you with this.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.480
So young couple, young.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.600
They got to be sexy.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.920
I'm just assuming this.

24:11.920 --> 24:12.920
It's Fox.

24:12.920 --> 24:13.920
Yeah.

24:13.920 --> 24:18.880
And then the four people that they live with for a year.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.600
So like the budget of this show is going to be astronomical.

24:21.600 --> 24:27.320
Just in terms of like tech, I have a lot of cameras, the editing for years or the footage.

24:27.320 --> 24:32.120
Each of the four people try and seduce them away.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.960
And if you can make it through that, if you can make it to that year long gauntlet of

24:35.960 --> 24:42.720
strange sex, then you not only win $50,000, which admittedly is not a lot for a year's

24:42.720 --> 24:45.120
worth of game show.

24:45.120 --> 24:51.720
You also know that your relationship is legit because you fended off the sex wolves.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.040
That's the name of the show is Sex Wolves.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.040
I saw that coming.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.040
Yeah.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.960
I didn't think that seemed to be a pretty good name for it.

24:57.960 --> 24:58.960
The Sex Wolves.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.680
Let me hit you.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
Here's the other twist.

25:01.680 --> 25:02.680
Okay.

25:02.680 --> 25:11.320
Once a month, actual wolf released into the house or they, everybody dresses up like,

25:11.320 --> 25:14.120
like furry wolf humans.

25:14.120 --> 25:19.160
Just to add another layer, another, another layer to this onion of sexuality.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.760
It's called the onion of sexuality.

25:20.760 --> 25:24.440
It's the web, the webisode companion piece.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.440
Wait.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.680
So you're going to record a year of footage and then put it on a five minute webisode?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.800
Well, the companion piece.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.760
It's going to be action packed.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.040
I'm talking, what I'm talking about is transmedia.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.060
Oh yeah.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.420
We're talking cereal.

25:38.420 --> 25:39.920
We're talking action figures.

25:39.920 --> 25:45.480
You can have sex wolf cereal, exactly.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.240
Start your day in the sex wolf way.

25:47.240 --> 25:52.920
Is there any, does that idea got legs at all for a reality show?

25:52.920 --> 25:58.420
But also as a practical, like if you're, if you guys can make it, it could be like maybe

25:58.420 --> 26:01.180
you're 90% sure you want to test that other 10%.

26:01.180 --> 26:02.560
Here's how you test that other 10%.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.640
Here's your litmus test.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.340
Go fucking live in the worst situation imaginable.

26:06.340 --> 26:10.120
And if you can make it through that, you're aces.

26:10.120 --> 26:16.820
Can you guys, is there some way you guys can buy yourself something amazing or like bury

26:16.820 --> 26:20.960
some cash somewhere and leave it for yourself as a reward at the end of this?

26:20.960 --> 26:24.880
So at least you'll have something to cling to when things get bag safe, but remember

26:24.880 --> 26:28.600
we put $50 in that lock, in that safety deposit box.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.360
We bought a trust fund.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.900
They're young.

26:31.900 --> 26:32.900
You know what I mean?

26:32.900 --> 26:34.080
They're young.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.320
They're so sexy.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.320
You know what I mean?

26:37.320 --> 26:38.640
They're very sexy and sexual.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.400
They're sexy and sexual.

26:40.400 --> 26:45.320
And that's why the wolves, that's another element cause like wolves can smell sexuality

26:45.320 --> 26:46.880
and they will hunt them.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.880
I'm sorry.

26:47.880 --> 26:48.880
I zoned out for a second.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.160
Is this actual wolves?

26:50.160 --> 26:51.680
Like are you letting at least four wolves in this house?

26:51.680 --> 26:53.120
Once a month.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.640
Fucking read, read the fucking script, Travis.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.120
Your elevator pitch has gone off the rails, Griffin.

26:59.120 --> 27:02.040
Wait, are you telling me sex wolves is scripted?

27:02.040 --> 27:03.520
It's been scripted this whole time.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.520
I knew it.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.520
Oh my God, it's a sham.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.000
It's only for the wolves.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.720
The wolves have speaking lines and the lines are, what do you got to shoot today, Bill?

27:10.720 --> 27:12.520
I'm doing another pouncing scene.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.600
So they want me to deliver this back to back.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.960
Woo, I want to fuck you.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.680
And like how am I, the first one was supposed to be a howl.

27:20.680 --> 27:24.800
Like my heart's not even in it.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.320
Wolves can't read.

27:28.320 --> 27:33.320
Well that just is a reflection of our school system.

27:33.320 --> 27:37.760
When we just send our wolves to school, what kind of nation is it that hines?

27:37.760 --> 27:38.760
Guys, stop.

27:38.760 --> 27:39.760
Wolf school.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.400
It's a new concept.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.240
I'm tired of all these mass shootings in our schools.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.400
The only way to protect their kids is wolves.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.400
Wolf school.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.400
2013.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.400
Catch it in the fall.

27:51.400 --> 27:56.080
The sound track sounds a lot more like an 80s summer movie.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.880
Every child in the American school system had a wolf.

27:59.880 --> 28:00.880
Look at Game of Thrones.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.880
They're fine.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.760
Protect mass shootings.

28:03.760 --> 28:10.000
We put in armed volunteers in our schools, but a lot of those, a startling amount of

28:10.000 --> 28:11.800
those ended up being perverts.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.540
How are we going to get those out?

28:13.540 --> 28:14.540
Wolf school.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.540
Fall 2013.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.200
Catch it on Fox Reality.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.200
Oops.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.920
The wolves apparently have a taste for kids too.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.080
What are we going to do now?

28:22.080 --> 28:25.200
Sharks flood the school.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.200
Flood school.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.200
Flood school.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.200
Shark school.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.200
Sharks and wolves.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.200
Sharks and wolves and kids.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.200
Oh no, the wolves have learned to swim.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.200
Kid battle.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.200
Battle Royale.

28:33.200 --> 28:38.440
Battle Royale, but with more sharks than wolves.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.160
That is going to hurt property values in that area.

28:41.160 --> 28:46.520
If your kids have to go to wolf shark school, the flooded, I don't know Debra, I like both

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
of these houses.

28:47.520 --> 28:52.120
At one, the kids are going to have to go to a flooded school full of wolves and sharks

28:52.120 --> 28:53.120
and it's on TV.

28:53.120 --> 28:57.760
There's so much gerrymandering because the wolf school has such a great football program.

28:57.760 --> 28:58.760
That's the other problem.

28:58.760 --> 28:59.760
I hate it.

28:59.760 --> 29:00.760
Plus I mean the fame.

29:00.760 --> 29:03.680
Yeah, that's a lot for a kid to take on.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.440
The fame of getting eaten by wolf sharks.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.440
Oops, they breeded.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.440
Didn't see that coming.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.440
I did though.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
And then they're warped.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.440
It's all scripted.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.440
I have an executive producer credit.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.440
Let's go to the money zone.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.440
Let me tell you guys about Marc Maron.

29:14.440 --> 29:15.440
Everybody.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.440
Everybody knows.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.600
He's a podcaster just like us.

29:18.600 --> 29:31.520
He's got a new show coming to IFC.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.520
It's called Maron.

29:32.520 --> 29:36.920
It starts Friday, May 3rd, 10 p.m. on IFC.

29:36.920 --> 29:41.280
It's a fictionalized version of Marc's life.

29:41.280 --> 29:45.680
I mean it would have to be because he makes a podcast so they know he's going to, they

29:45.680 --> 29:47.360
got to sex it up I guess, right?

29:47.360 --> 29:48.920
I mean I wouldn't watch a show about me.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.840
Would you guys watch a show about you?

29:50.840 --> 29:51.840
Definitely.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.760
I mean I would but I have a lot of issues.

29:53.760 --> 29:59.520
I might if it had Judd Hirsch, Gina Gershon, Aubrey Plaza, and Adam Scott on it.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.320
Which Marc Maron does.

30:01.320 --> 30:05.720
And oh and this week's episode is one of my heroes, Dave Foley.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.840
Who Griffin and I saw in LA once.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.040
He gave me a, he gave me a Kurt head nod.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.040
Oh really?

30:11.040 --> 30:12.800
Yeah, it was a big moment for us.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.680
So you guys are like best friends?

30:14.680 --> 30:15.680
Basically.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.680
Okay.

30:16.680 --> 30:20.200
So next week's episode, Marc, well not this, yeah I guess this week's.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.280
This is this week, isn't it?

30:22.280 --> 30:26.920
And this week's episode, Marc and Dave are going to go after an abusive fan on Twitter

30:26.920 --> 30:28.240
that has been tormenting Marc.

30:28.240 --> 30:31.800
Wow, so this really is like my day to day life actually.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.560
Only it stars Marc Maron so it'll be funnier.

30:34.560 --> 30:41.640
He's the creator, producer, and again that's Fridays at 10 p.m. on IFC so don't miss Maron.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.640
Is he playing?

30:42.640 --> 30:45.280
It kind of sounds like, if you didn't know anything about it, Maron does sound like a

30:45.280 --> 30:46.280
private eye show, right?

30:46.280 --> 30:47.280
Don't you think?

30:47.280 --> 30:48.280
A little bit.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.280
Maron.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.280
Sounds like Castle.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.280
You know what I mean?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.280
Castle.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.280
Or like.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.280
Still not sure what's going on in that show.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.280
Berks Law.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.360
Yeah, he was like a writer and he was like solving, he was like using his writer powers

30:59.360 --> 31:03.600
to solve crimes but now he's like a proper detective except he's really smarmy and he's

31:03.600 --> 31:06.680
getting a little chunky.

31:06.680 --> 31:07.680
Don't you dare.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.680
I don't know.

31:08.680 --> 31:09.680
How dare you?

31:09.680 --> 31:10.680
How dare you?

31:10.680 --> 31:11.680
There's some chunk there.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.680
Not on Marc Maron.

31:12.680 --> 31:18.160
Not on Marc Maron though, he's thin and he's got a podcast and he's got a show about it

31:18.160 --> 31:24.680
called Maron at Fridays on IFC at 10 p.m. so tune in to that.

31:24.680 --> 31:29.040
While you're watching Maron, why not go check out the Morphe webcomic?

31:29.040 --> 31:33.800
That's at morphe.thewebcomic.com.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.520
Morphe is how that's pronounced.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.920
I've recently learned.

31:37.920 --> 31:43.960
In the next sentence, oh our producer just popped his head into the booth.

31:43.960 --> 31:44.960
What's that?

31:44.960 --> 31:46.760
Hey, what is that Antonio?

31:46.760 --> 31:50.200
Scarpacci from Winx?

31:50.200 --> 31:56.080
Our producer is Antonio Scarpacci from Winx cause he's fake so why the fuck not?

31:56.080 --> 32:00.280
It's just called fun guys, it's just called using your imagination for fun.

32:00.280 --> 32:06.380
Morphe is a really actually, it's cool, it's not like a standard webcomic, it sort of blends,

32:06.380 --> 32:15.120
it's coded in flash but it's scary and you have to click through it so it takes advantage

32:15.120 --> 32:16.120
of today's technology.

32:16.120 --> 32:23.520
You know so many webcomics, you could have read them in an analog format and this takes

32:23.520 --> 32:26.200
full advantage of internet.

32:26.200 --> 32:32.400
Sometimes I just print out webcomics just so I don't have to think about my life.

32:32.400 --> 32:36.360
Sometimes I print out webcomics if it's a really good Ziggy and I just wanna keep it

32:36.360 --> 32:37.360
on the wall.

32:37.360 --> 32:42.920
And when I'm reading eZiggy, man, bad guy in technology, do not get along.

32:42.920 --> 32:52.600
Morphe is not like Ziggy or like Marmaduke but you can find it at morphe.thewebcomic.com.

32:52.600 --> 32:55.160
Very cool, very spooky, it's got sounds I think.

32:55.160 --> 32:59.600
I can't print it if I lose its interactivity.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.600
You could do like a flipbook.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.000
I can't turn my speakers up, make sure it does have sounds.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
It does.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
I think it has sounds.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
It does, I'm clicking through right now.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Oh Jesus Christ!

33:07.000 --> 33:14.680
Okay, I actually just got scared by the webcomic by turning up my speakers too much so I will

33:14.680 --> 33:16.360
caution you to not do that.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.920
That is podcast history being made.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.720
Justin scares himself made a podcast.

33:22.720 --> 33:26.480
Okay morphe.thewebcomic.com, go check it out.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.160
I'm puked, I'm puked.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.660
Okay, you puked me, I'm puked.

33:32.660 --> 33:42.880
You know what, speaking of puked or spooked or spuked, let's back off our usual XR approach

33:42.880 --> 33:46.960
when coming at the Extreme Restraints marketing.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.240
Let's rally around our marketing team.

33:49.240 --> 33:54.880
Let's talk about something that doesn't involve nine foot long sex logs.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.840
Okay here's what we got.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.520
You don't know where to start, right?

33:59.520 --> 34:04.320
Why not pick up an adult instructional book?

34:04.320 --> 34:08.960
Don't let the kids find these, unless you want like a cool kid who understands a woman's

34:08.960 --> 34:09.960
body.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.480
How old a kid is that appropriate, starting with the youngest?

34:13.480 --> 34:16.000
I want my two to three to four year old to understand a woman's body.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.280
I don't think there's anything wrong with that, it's science.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.220
There's about seven things wrong with that.

34:20.220 --> 34:25.640
You could pick up the Ultimate Guide to Flatio, How to Go Down on a Man, $17, no problem.

34:25.640 --> 34:29.120
I think you pronounced that wrong, I think it's full audio.

34:29.120 --> 34:35.800
Man, I was at my Filotti's class the other day and my thighs are still burning.

34:35.800 --> 34:40.520
You get on a recumbent bike and you blow a guy.

34:40.520 --> 34:46.680
Here's a good book, it's called Jay Wiseman, Tricks to Please a Woman.

34:46.680 --> 34:52.160
Jay has put his name before the title, which seems a little braggy to me.

34:52.160 --> 34:55.160
But you know what, that's confidence in your product right there.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.320
Let me pitch this question to you guys.

34:57.320 --> 35:04.320
Whose name would have to appear in that book's title for you guys to bite?

35:04.320 --> 35:05.320
Al Franken.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.320
Oh.

35:06.320 --> 35:07.320
What?

35:07.320 --> 35:09.920
You just said the first name that came to your head.

35:09.920 --> 35:10.920
Nope.

35:10.920 --> 35:16.800
What if it said a word that was obfuscated somehow, maybe it was fuzzy, and then it said

35:16.800 --> 35:17.800
Quaid.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.640
And so it's like, you're getting one of the Quaids.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.760
You're getting one of the Quaid sex tip books.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.480
Wait, do you know?

35:24.480 --> 35:25.840
You don't know the Quaid, that's what I'm saying.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.280
So you're saying like the first name is like smudged?

35:27.280 --> 35:33.380
The first name has been obscured somehow, but it is definitely a Quaid.

35:33.380 --> 35:37.960
You have a famous Quaid guarantee, so you're not just getting some Hammonegger Quaid off

35:37.960 --> 35:38.960
the street.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.160
Okay, it's a famous Quaid at least.

35:41.160 --> 35:45.240
You're flipping the coin, one side is Dennis, one side is Randy.

35:45.240 --> 35:50.960
I think you would know pretty quickly, even unlabeled.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.840
Hit her vagina with a sandwich.

35:52.840 --> 35:53.840
Oh fuck.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.160
She got randied.

35:56.160 --> 36:01.560
There is a book here called Masterclass Pregnant Sex.

36:01.560 --> 36:06.320
There's a picture of a pregnant woman, she's holding her breasts, and it helpfully has

36:06.320 --> 36:12.800
the label sexually explicit on it, which is, I think, is a little redundant.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.920
But again, you can pick up all this stuff at extremistraints.com.

36:16.920 --> 36:23.540
If you use the coupon code FANNYTIME, you're gonna save 20% on your order, and it's all

36:23.540 --> 36:24.720
shipped discreetly.

36:24.720 --> 36:28.480
This is one of the only kinds of information that I would want to get out of a book instead

36:28.480 --> 36:29.480
of internet.

36:29.480 --> 36:36.880
Because if you search internet like, how do I do good sex to a woman, then you're gonna

36:36.880 --> 36:38.080
be flooded.

36:38.080 --> 36:41.680
If nothing else, do yourself a favor and just go to extremistraints.com and just kind of

36:41.680 --> 36:42.680
browse.

36:42.680 --> 36:43.680
Just look around.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.320
The nice thing is, unlike other sex stores, there's no creepy person behind the counter

36:47.320 --> 36:48.320
judging you.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.320
Yeah.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.920
Doesn't hurt to look around, unless you're in the library, then don't do it.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.520
And you can probably, if you look around, you can probably find someone to jerk off

36:55.520 --> 36:56.520
to.

36:56.520 --> 36:57.520
Oh yeah.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.520
I think.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
I bet.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.520
Yeah.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.520
Or lady jerk off to.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.520
That's still called that.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.520
I don't think...

37:03.520 --> 37:05.760
No, I think it's called you jilling off at that point.

37:05.760 --> 37:06.760
Can you not?

37:06.760 --> 37:07.760
Can you not ever?

37:07.760 --> 37:08.760
Again, please, sir.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.760
You jill off.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.760
Because you jack off, and then you jill off.

37:10.760 --> 37:11.760
Can you...

37:11.760 --> 37:12.760
If you would not, I would appreciate...

37:12.760 --> 37:13.760
Please don't.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
I would, if you would not, sir.

37:14.760 --> 37:15.760
Why jill off?

37:15.760 --> 37:16.760
It's not weird.

37:16.760 --> 37:17.760
It's not weird.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.880
Why does female pleasure make you sick?

37:19.880 --> 37:20.880
I have...

37:20.880 --> 37:25.480
I have no way of knowing.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.720
You know that feeling you get when you hear a song that you just love?

37:28.720 --> 37:31.320
What about a new movie, or a new book, or a TV show?

37:31.320 --> 37:32.540
I'm Jesse Thorne.

37:32.540 --> 37:36.240
My show Bullseye points to the good stuff in popular culture, the kind of stuff that

37:36.240 --> 37:37.920
will change your life.

37:37.920 --> 37:41.320
In-depth interviews with cultural creators, critics' picks for the best new releases,

37:41.320 --> 37:44.080
and a weekly recommendation from yours truly.

37:44.080 --> 37:52.560
It's Bullseye with me, Jesse Thorne, for MaximumFun.org and PRI.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.600
For years, I've been heavily into the video game and nerd culture in general.

37:55.600 --> 38:00.480
I have an upright glass case in which I have my pop culture and video game related articles,

38:00.480 --> 38:04.360
such as a replica, lightsaber, and video game figures.

38:04.360 --> 38:08.200
I'm trying to be a woman, and I'm horribly self-conscious about my glass case, making

38:08.200 --> 38:12.600
me seem like a man-child, which I guess I am, since I have this in my house.

38:12.600 --> 38:17.320
I'm trying to make change be more appealing to opposite sex, and I feel like this glass

38:17.320 --> 38:19.440
case makes me seem immature.

38:19.440 --> 38:23.160
The problem is, my friends have given me many of these things, and if I store their gifts

38:23.160 --> 38:26.100
away or sell them, I'm afraid they'll be a little hurt by it.

38:26.100 --> 38:29.560
How do I avoid hurting my friends' feelings while at the same time trying to present myself

38:29.560 --> 38:32.600
as an actual adult to potential romantic interest?

38:32.600 --> 38:34.440
That's from Glass Case of Emotion, Cincinnati.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.160
This is a damn good question.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.160
This is a good question.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.160
Can I real talk for a minute?

38:38.160 --> 38:39.160
Yeah, sure.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.560
Because I have like a real serious non-funny answer.

38:41.560 --> 38:44.000
We haven't had any of those so far, so please.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.880
Okay, here's my real talk.

38:46.880 --> 38:51.040
It has nothing to do with the items in your home.

38:51.040 --> 38:54.840
I don't care what it is that you've collected or what it is that you have.

38:54.840 --> 38:59.360
It is the person that you are that determines whether you're perceived as that thing or

38:59.360 --> 39:00.360
not.

39:00.360 --> 39:06.240
I've known lots of people that had toys or sports memorabilia or anything, and that is

39:06.240 --> 39:07.720
not who they are.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.560
It's just something that they happen to like.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.240
I know a guy, one of the coolest guys I've ever known.

39:12.240 --> 39:16.400
He's a really successful director around town, has an awesome wife, and he has all these

39:16.400 --> 39:20.480
amazing little tin soldiers, and I've never looked at him and gone, oh, he collects toys?

39:20.480 --> 39:21.480
What a nerd.

39:21.480 --> 39:25.280
Well, that's fine, Travis, but you have to recognize that there's a limit in everything

39:25.280 --> 39:31.120
else to this question where if the things that you are collecting is like tentacle porn

39:31.120 --> 39:38.800
anime busts, then maybe, yes, that's a bad, that's gonna be a turnoff for 99.9 repeating

39:38.800 --> 39:40.440
percent of people in the universe.

39:40.440 --> 39:46.800
I have to say, I'm a big fan, I think he's already made the most important stride, and

39:46.800 --> 39:52.160
that is to put your displaying in a glass case.

39:52.160 --> 39:57.920
That seems to me to be like, okay, it's not a decorating motif, which a lot of people

39:57.920 --> 40:04.600
go for, and if you want to, that's fine, but to me, this seems like a little more regimented.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.600
It seems more grown up to me.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.600
It's sectioned off.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.960
You're saying this is my display.

40:07.960 --> 40:12.720
This is this part of my life, and everything that's not in there doesn't belong to this

40:12.720 --> 40:13.720
part of my life.

40:13.720 --> 40:19.380
Yeah, it makes it seem like a facet of your character rather than just my personality

40:19.380 --> 40:24.680
is a remixed, yeah, exactly right.

40:24.680 --> 40:28.080
Now if you're someone that when you have someone over the house, the first thing you do is

40:28.080 --> 40:32.800
now come look at my case, then yes, maybe that's not a good way to go.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.280
Try not to talk like comic book nerd from Simpsons.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.280
That's not gonna help you.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.280
That's not where someone's like, oh, what's all this?

40:38.280 --> 40:40.640
Be like, oh, that's just stuff I've collected over the years.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.680
Well, no, because there's gotta be a happy meeting, because you just sounded fucking

40:43.680 --> 40:44.680
ashamed.

40:44.680 --> 40:45.680
Oh, that's my shame.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.680
Oh, that?

40:46.680 --> 40:47.680
That's my case.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.000
That's my shame rectangle.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.200
Please don't acknowledge it.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.200
That's why I'm embarrassed by it.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.200
Don't get on my case.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.200
No, that's just a little joke I make.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.200
Come on over.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.200
Hey, seriously.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.640
Get the fuck out of there.

40:59.640 --> 41:00.640
That's limited edition.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.080
I said leave.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.880
That's my Mad Mardigan Willow special edition figure.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.800
It was a chase item.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.800
He has, you see, only one eyebrow.

41:10.800 --> 41:11.800
That's worth $17.

41:11.800 --> 41:16.800
Are you gonna replace it?

41:16.800 --> 41:18.760
I didn't think so.

41:18.760 --> 41:19.760
I don't know.

41:19.760 --> 41:20.760
This is so alien to me.

41:20.760 --> 41:24.480
I'm such a big ass fucking nerd, and I don't know.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.520
This is something I feel like I struggle with a lot.

41:26.520 --> 41:31.800
Maybe less than I did when I was in college, but I've always been a big nerd, but I have

41:31.800 --> 41:41.960
never been fast to show it, to have things displayed in my house that act as insignias

41:41.960 --> 41:44.280
for visitors.

41:44.280 --> 41:45.600
This is the kind of shit I'm into.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.600
Yeah, it's funny.

41:46.600 --> 41:49.600
I have stuff, but I've never crossed that line.

41:49.600 --> 41:53.620
I have one thing that if you're looking carefully, you'll see my collection of California raisins

41:53.620 --> 41:59.120
and Houdini action figure and Doctor Who stuff, but no one's gonna see it surface level right

41:59.120 --> 42:00.120
away.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.120
This is, oh man.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.720
I don't know.

42:02.720 --> 42:09.880
I feel like if you have things that make you happy, that is the most important thing, and

42:09.880 --> 42:10.960
that's who you are.

42:10.960 --> 42:16.200
I think if you're holding on to stuff because your friends gave it to you, that's a bad

42:16.200 --> 42:20.080
reason to hold on to things, because I guarantee they don't care.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.080
They really don't.

42:21.080 --> 42:24.600
Unless you're holding on to it because it means something to you because a friend gave

42:24.600 --> 42:25.600
it to you.

42:25.600 --> 42:29.960
Well, he used the word store, which isn't typically the word you use for sentimental

42:29.960 --> 42:30.960
presents.

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
Yeah, sure.

42:31.960 --> 42:32.960
Yeah, fuck it.

42:32.960 --> 42:33.960
Put it, yeah.

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
Sure.

42:34.960 --> 42:35.960
How long?

42:35.960 --> 42:36.960
A month?

42:36.960 --> 42:37.960
Yeah, I guess.

42:37.960 --> 42:43.280
I've put away so many, I've put away my childish things as I've grown older, and then I bought

42:43.280 --> 42:44.520
new things on eBay.

42:44.520 --> 42:48.920
I bought Captain Power toys because those are nostalgic for me and they make me really

42:48.920 --> 42:49.920
happy.

42:49.920 --> 42:50.920
So I have them.

42:50.920 --> 42:55.860
So you basically, you refresh your stock of childish things like the Bible tells you so.

42:55.860 --> 43:02.340
I got that elite childish stuff that seem more collector-y.

43:02.340 --> 43:06.160
They seem more like harder to come by.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.640
Like fushigi balls.

43:07.640 --> 43:10.300
No, those don't count.

43:10.300 --> 43:16.920
There is a difference between hiding something because you think the person, somebody's gonna

43:16.920 --> 43:21.600
think less of you, and hiding it because it's not the image of yourself that you wanna put

43:21.600 --> 43:22.760
out there.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.680
Because I think that those are two different things.

43:24.680 --> 43:31.360
I mean, I do think we have a, I think we have a problem in a lot of facets of what people

43:31.360 --> 43:37.000
would call nerd culture of not being able to distinguish between things you like and

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
things that you are.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Yeah.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
And I think that-

43:40.000 --> 43:46.120
I think it's just, I think it's inherently unhealthy to self-identify based on media

43:46.120 --> 43:48.600
consumption of any kind.

43:48.600 --> 43:53.120
Because if you do that with nerd shit, and say you're a nerd, you're painting yourself

43:53.120 --> 43:59.040
into a corner, but like on the flip side, if you just watch independent art house films

43:59.040 --> 44:03.840
from the 1930s and say, oh, that's me.

44:03.840 --> 44:09.000
That's where I'm coming from, is I'm independent art house movies from the 1930s guy.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.720
Like that guy sucks too.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.600
Like that guy's not very great.

44:12.600 --> 44:17.380
If that's the only thing that he uses to define the shape of his character.

44:17.380 --> 44:18.380
That's what I'm saying.

44:18.380 --> 44:22.200
I think the problem is, is like when you have something any quality like that, it's overwhelming

44:22.200 --> 44:23.200
to it.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.200
Oh, me?

44:24.200 --> 44:25.200
I'm jazz guy.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.200
You know me.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.200
I'm jazz guy.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.200
I'm sports guy.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.240
Let me tell you all about my sports team, because that's all I'm going to talk about

44:29.240 --> 44:32.360
for the next two hours, because it's literally all I know.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.560
Like nobody likes that person, no matter what it is.

44:35.560 --> 44:38.700
Start trying to put things in your house that keep people on their toes.

44:38.700 --> 44:39.700
That's what I'm saying.

44:39.700 --> 44:40.700
Have a knife somewhere.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.440
Just somewhere.

44:42.440 --> 44:45.140
Half a mummy.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.140
Which have you asked?

44:46.140 --> 44:47.140
Player's choice.

44:47.140 --> 44:48.140
Player's choice.

44:48.140 --> 44:49.140
Doesn't matter.

44:49.140 --> 44:50.140
You guys want a Yahoo?

44:50.140 --> 44:51.140
Please.

44:51.140 --> 44:52.320
This question was sent in by Julie Martin.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.320
Thanks, Julie.

44:53.320 --> 44:59.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Leonardo, who asks, how do the birthday spankings?

44:59.280 --> 45:01.520
How do the birthday spankings?

45:01.520 --> 45:02.520
I am Brazilian.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.640
I'm 24 years old.

45:03.640 --> 45:08.120
I graduated in law in the United States, and I'm doing post-graduation.

45:08.120 --> 45:11.600
Also I have friends and relatives here, like this country.

45:11.600 --> 45:15.160
Tomorrow's my birthday, as tradition is the birthday spankings.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.320
How this game works?

45:16.320 --> 45:17.320
Is it custom here?

45:17.320 --> 45:19.320
I'll have my birthday party tomorrow.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.320
Thank you.

45:20.320 --> 45:28.480
Oh, how it works is awfully... No, it's really common here in our country.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.040
I'm so glad you came to us.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.040
Welcome.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.880
Basically every... Welcome, welcome.

45:33.880 --> 45:37.800
On your birthday, you should find people.

45:37.800 --> 45:41.360
You don't want them to be too close to you, so someone you're more of an acquaintance

45:41.360 --> 45:44.240
with, or... Law school buddies, maybe.

45:44.240 --> 45:49.360
Most desirably, law school buddies, perhaps professors would be a good fit here.

45:49.360 --> 45:55.440
You go to them, and you say, hello, it's my 24th birthday, and I got a hanker for spankering,

45:55.440 --> 45:59.640
and then you turn around, and you show them your hindquarters, and you say, go to town,

45:59.640 --> 46:00.640
James Brown.

46:00.640 --> 46:03.360
Are we talking about bare tushy, or are we talking...

46:03.360 --> 46:04.920
Good question.

46:04.920 --> 46:09.160
Because you have different levels, you could go pants, underpants, bare tushy, or three

46:09.160 --> 46:10.160
pairs of pants.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.880
It's up to you.

46:11.880 --> 46:15.320
Are we talking, do you want to get a belt in there, maybe an extremely strange pain

46:15.320 --> 46:18.480
paddle of some sort?

46:18.480 --> 46:25.320
I think you really need that open hand contact to really get the emotion across.

46:25.320 --> 46:31.560
Just say, my tushy's 24 years old, and I need to knock some of those years off, so please

46:31.560 --> 46:34.360
go to town out of my butt.

46:34.360 --> 46:37.520
It would be great, too, if they had a little water bottle, and they could spritz a little

46:37.520 --> 46:42.840
moisture on their hand before each one, just so you get that really nice wet skin on skin

46:42.840 --> 46:43.840
action.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.920
Oh, God.

46:45.920 --> 46:51.040
It is also important that they give you, quote, one to grow on, end quote, or you will die.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.960
Yeah, numerically, let's talk about it, because are we talking one per year, or are we talking

46:54.960 --> 46:59.640
about 18 is an important birthday, should maybe we double up on that?

46:59.640 --> 47:03.480
If I remember correctly, when I turned 18, Nonnie doubled up the amount of money she

47:03.480 --> 47:07.240
sent me, and I got $36, so I think it works the same way with spankings.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.760
So double up on the spankings.

47:08.760 --> 47:16.960
I think it's every prime number, you do an extra, whatever the last prime number was,

47:16.960 --> 47:18.280
you tack that on, too.

47:18.280 --> 47:24.680
So I mean, once you get up into like, you know, like 97 years old, is that a prime number?

47:24.680 --> 47:25.680
Somebody gotta get me.

47:25.680 --> 47:26.680
No.

47:26.680 --> 47:27.680
37?

47:27.680 --> 47:28.680
Yeah, you're good.

47:28.680 --> 47:29.680
97.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.680
97's good.

47:30.680 --> 47:31.680
You're gonna-

47:31.680 --> 47:38.040
Anything ending in seven, except for 27, maybe some others.

47:38.040 --> 47:39.800
Just don't let them put their finger in your butt.

47:39.800 --> 47:40.800
Oh god, no.

47:40.800 --> 47:41.800
That's so gauche.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.160
That's like the French way of doing it.

47:43.160 --> 47:48.640
It's like getting a wet willy, it's like, ah, we were doing something else.

47:48.640 --> 47:54.280
I have not thought about birthday spankings in, like, if you had asked me about birthday

47:54.280 --> 47:58.960
spankings 15 minutes ago, I think I would have said I'm not sure if that was ever a

47:58.960 --> 47:59.960
thing or not.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.320
Like, I'm not sure I would have fully recalled birthday spankings being-

48:03.320 --> 48:08.400
But then you remembered the joy of the game of birthday spanking, said this person.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.200
It's not- there's no- there are no combatants.

48:12.200 --> 48:18.560
There aren't rules and goals and points and a win condition.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.040
There's no fail state in birthday spanking.

48:20.040 --> 48:21.380
There's no fail state.

48:21.380 --> 48:23.080
Everybody wins!

48:23.080 --> 48:25.240
One swat with a hand of paddle for every year of birth.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.840
Not supposed to be too hard.

48:26.840 --> 48:31.600
Hey, Yahoo Answers user David B., this guy's from another country, can you maybe go easy

48:31.600 --> 48:32.600
on him?

48:32.600 --> 48:37.680
Like, you are fucking- you are- you are putting forward the stereotype.

48:37.680 --> 48:42.000
You are making it worse for the rest of us by saying, hey, foreigner, you don't understand

48:42.000 --> 48:44.680
our traditions, stupid.

48:44.680 --> 48:48.720
I think not supposed to be too hard is don't spank them too hard, Griffin.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.080
Yeah, Griffin.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.440
Not that it's not supposed to be difficult.

48:51.440 --> 48:55.720
Well then he's fucking goofing them twice, because it's supposed to be very, very hard.

48:55.720 --> 48:59.040
Sorry, that's another thing that we should have mentioned.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.040
Oh, it should take off a little bit each time.

49:01.040 --> 49:02.040
Oh my god.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.880
It should- it should hurt- they should be physically exhausted.

49:04.880 --> 49:09.160
They should feel like a- like a rail splitter at the end of a shift.

49:09.160 --> 49:10.160
Like you-

49:10.160 --> 49:11.160
By the end of it-

49:11.160 --> 49:12.160
That is why old people walk so funny.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.160
Exactly.

49:13.160 --> 49:16.400
Your butt should look like the face of the guy that looked inside the Ark of the Covenant.

49:16.400 --> 49:19.280
It should just be all melty and bones in there.

49:19.280 --> 49:23.520
Your butt should be- it should be the fourth type of substance, plasma.

49:23.520 --> 49:27.320
It should be- it should be between states.

49:27.320 --> 49:31.960
It should be like cold chowder.

49:31.960 --> 49:36.480
It should be like coal slurry.

49:36.480 --> 49:41.680
I wish people would stop fracking my butt.

49:41.680 --> 49:43.080
How about it, Uncle Sam?

49:43.080 --> 49:48.320
Do you have the courage to stop big, big coal from fracking my butt?

49:48.320 --> 49:49.320
I just-

49:49.320 --> 49:52.400
They just keep shooting water into the loosened stuff up down there.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.680
I don't know how fracking works.

49:53.680 --> 49:58.840
I'm just getting tired of all the butt top removal, because it's getting hard to prop

49:58.840 --> 50:00.320
myself up in a chair.

50:00.320 --> 50:03.240
You know, politicians keep claiming that there's clean butt.

50:03.240 --> 50:06.640
There's no such thing as clean butt.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.760
Baby's butts aren't clean.

50:07.760 --> 50:09.880
There's like original sin in there.

50:09.880 --> 50:10.880
No.

50:10.880 --> 50:17.200
Though I will say at extreme restraints, they do have a series of enemas that will guarantee

50:17.200 --> 50:18.760
a clean butt.

50:18.760 --> 50:20.640
One of which you just attach to a shower head.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.640
Holy shit.

50:21.640 --> 50:22.640
That sounds really convenient.

50:22.640 --> 50:23.640
Yeah.

50:23.640 --> 50:27.880
Can you propel it all the way up your body so it comes out your mouth?

50:27.880 --> 50:30.400
I guess it depends on your water pressure, really.

50:30.400 --> 50:32.120
I mean, that's going to be a-

50:32.120 --> 50:33.120
Oh, no.

50:33.120 --> 50:34.120
Sorry.

50:34.120 --> 50:35.120
It would come out of your belly button.

50:35.120 --> 50:39.360
It's like one of those safety drains in a sink.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.720
I started a new job this week.

50:41.720 --> 50:45.120
The office often orders lunch for everyone, paid for by the company.

50:45.120 --> 50:49.280
My coworkers eagerly eat the food, and I have been game for the first week.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.800
I want to be a social part of the group, but at some point, I will want to bring my own

50:51.800 --> 50:53.320
healthier lunches.

50:53.320 --> 50:57.440
How can I make this change smoothly with my delivery devouring coworkers?

50:57.440 --> 51:00.960
That's from Dining Dilemma in Dallas.

51:00.960 --> 51:04.960
You missed it already because you had to say you had a gluten allergy.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.240
Yeah, but here's the thing.

51:07.240 --> 51:11.440
What if they're really conscientious and then they start ordering things specifically to

51:11.440 --> 51:15.520
accommodate your- and they're like, it costs a little bit more, but we care about you,

51:15.520 --> 51:17.720
Susan, so we want to make sure you don't die.

51:17.720 --> 51:23.720
Why don't you just say that you're a fucking 30-year-old adult, I'm assuming you're 30,

51:23.720 --> 51:27.960
and that you want to fucking eat your own food that you picked out for yourself because

51:27.960 --> 51:31.000
that's one of the great privileges that adulthood brings you.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.660
You can do whatever you want when you're an adult.

51:32.660 --> 51:33.900
You don't have to eat that stuff.

51:33.900 --> 51:36.560
Say you're trying to slim down, who can't appreciate that?

51:36.560 --> 51:41.760
Yeah, I think that this is- okay, on one hand, this is a totally perceived problem because

51:41.760 --> 51:45.380
I doubt very much that any company is going to be like, but I wanted to spend more money

51:45.380 --> 51:46.380
on you.

51:46.380 --> 51:51.100
Yeah, or that any of your coworkers will be like, oh man, there's more sandwiches for

51:51.100 --> 51:54.320
my fat fucking face to eat, aw, nerds.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.960
Why isn't she eating the Jimmy John's?

51:55.960 --> 51:56.960
Ugh.

51:56.960 --> 52:03.680
But then on the other hand, this just might be me because I am a gluten, the idea of someone

52:03.680 --> 52:08.160
saying, hey, I'm going to get you free food, and you'd be like, no, that's mean.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.160
Eat that food.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.160
You want that food.

52:10.160 --> 52:11.160
Everybody wants that food.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.140
It's not free, though, because you helped earn that money.

52:13.140 --> 52:15.720
You worked so they could get those profits and then it's going to feed your friends.

52:15.720 --> 52:18.560
Maybe you could arrange a deal where it's like, hey, instead of getting a sandwich every

52:18.560 --> 52:21.680
day, you give me like a $5 a day raise.

52:21.680 --> 52:26.600
Just bring your lunch in a paper sack that says Rebecca on it and then look sheepishly

52:26.600 --> 52:32.560
and said, yeah, mine, my Nana packs them, so I have to eat it.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.120
It's just a thing.

52:34.120 --> 52:35.760
She packs it for me every day and I love her so much.

52:35.760 --> 52:38.720
I'm not going to have her much longer, so I'm just going to keep eating my lunches for

52:38.720 --> 52:39.720
Nana.

52:39.720 --> 52:40.720
And then when they're like, oh, is Nana your grandmother?

52:40.720 --> 52:42.360
I'm like, no, she's my servant.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.360
She's my servant.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.360
Yeah.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.360
I'm not going to have her much longer.

52:45.360 --> 52:46.360
That depreciates.

52:46.360 --> 52:49.360
She's my, she's my giant dog, like in Peter Pan.

52:49.360 --> 52:54.760
You open the bag and there's just a bone in there and it's adorable.

52:54.760 --> 52:55.760
Dirt again.

52:55.760 --> 52:58.360
It's just a bag of grass.

52:58.360 --> 53:02.920
Can you just not bring, here's the one thing I would request of somebody who worked in

53:02.920 --> 53:06.200
like close quarters for many years.

53:06.200 --> 53:12.120
Can you not bring something that stinks for your lunch?

53:12.120 --> 53:18.600
That used to fucking kill me when people would bring like, this is garlic salad and they

53:18.600 --> 53:19.600
would bring it and eat it.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.600
It's just a big bowl of cloves of garlic.

53:22.600 --> 53:27.480
And they would heat it up in the microwave and the whole office would smell like a taxi

53:27.480 --> 53:29.120
and it made me want to die.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.120
So please don't bring-

53:30.120 --> 53:31.120
You know what I realize?

53:31.120 --> 53:32.120
What?

53:32.120 --> 53:35.120
That goes the same way if it smells good too, because I mean then you're sitting there in

53:35.120 --> 53:38.840
the office going, what is it, what it, oh God, now I want that.

53:38.840 --> 53:39.840
Now that's all I want.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.040
You need to bring food that doesn't smell.

53:42.040 --> 53:48.280
You need to bring a tube of nutrient slop.

53:48.280 --> 53:49.280
By which I mean go-gurt.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.100
Do they make healthy go-gurt?

53:51.100 --> 53:52.100
All yogurt's healthy.

53:52.100 --> 53:53.100
It's got protein in it.

53:53.100 --> 53:54.100
I guess that's true.

53:54.100 --> 53:56.840
I have a Yahoo answer if you guys will allow it.

53:56.840 --> 53:57.840
Yes.

53:57.840 --> 54:00.620
This Yahoo was sent in by, help please.

54:00.620 --> 54:02.120
I didn't say I would allow it.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.000
Travis, can I have your-

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
I will allow it.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Thank you.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
It was sent in by Alex-

54:07.000 --> 54:09.040
It's so antiquated to ask Travis's permission.

54:09.040 --> 54:12.960
It was sent in by Alex Krasminski, thanks Alex.

54:12.960 --> 54:17.660
It's by Yahoo answers user, help please, who asks, where do I put my hands when making

54:17.660 --> 54:19.280
out and I am a girl?

54:19.280 --> 54:20.280
Straight up in the air.

54:20.280 --> 54:22.480
Just straight up in the air like you're being mugged.

54:22.480 --> 54:24.800
Like you just do not care.

54:24.800 --> 54:25.960
I like that.

54:25.960 --> 54:30.200
Or maybe like you're on a rollercoaster, because when you're making out with me, you sure as

54:30.200 --> 54:31.200
hell are.

54:31.200 --> 54:35.080
Oh, what if you did that thing where you were kind of like rapidly waving them like you

54:35.080 --> 54:36.080
were being electrocuted.

54:36.080 --> 54:39.240
That's going to be exhausting.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.240
Did you feel that?

54:40.240 --> 54:41.240
I felt it.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.400
And she sounds like she's in the long haul.

54:43.400 --> 54:49.600
I feel for her because like as a dude, I feel like making out is means to an end to get

54:49.600 --> 54:57.000
your hand on those sweater dogs, but when you're a girl, it's like you don't have any-

54:57.000 --> 55:00.440
That's my favorite Kuba Goode Jr.

55:00.440 --> 55:03.280
It's hands down.

55:03.280 --> 55:11.480
Lots of people like Jared Maguire, but I like sweater dogs.

55:11.480 --> 55:15.280
Just use your hand to steal his wallet because he's not going to stop you, especially if

55:15.280 --> 55:17.160
he's a young boy, a young man.

55:17.160 --> 55:19.000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.280
When you're a guy and you're making out, it's like how are you going to grab those

55:21.280 --> 55:22.280
boobs?

55:22.280 --> 55:25.600
And as a girl, it's like you don't have a secondary objective.

55:25.600 --> 55:26.600
You know what I mean?

55:26.600 --> 55:27.600
Like straight footballs.

55:27.600 --> 55:30.760
Yeah, but that's jumping six or seven sharks.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.920
That's like you are skipping some steps there.

55:32.920 --> 55:36.480
You shouldn't be making out around sharks unless you go to shark school.

55:36.480 --> 55:42.800
Then somebody suggested shoulders, thighs, ribs after a while on his tap handle, which

55:42.800 --> 55:43.800
I guess is his dick.

55:43.800 --> 55:44.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:44.800 --> 55:47.960
On his what?

55:47.960 --> 55:49.280
The creepiest word in there?

55:49.280 --> 55:51.000
Do you want me to specify the creepiest word?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.440
Because it was ribs.

55:53.440 --> 55:54.440
Let me just-

55:54.440 --> 56:00.120
Just play you like a xylophone.

56:00.120 --> 56:02.520
Let me imagine I'll be inside that cage.

56:02.520 --> 56:03.520
What's in there?

56:03.520 --> 56:04.520
Is it your heart?

56:04.520 --> 56:05.520
You know what?

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
I've got one of these ribs.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.520
We sync up, Steven.

56:07.520 --> 56:08.520
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

56:08.520 --> 56:09.520
Thanks for the rib.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.520
Shaysu.

56:10.520 --> 56:11.520
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

56:11.520 --> 56:12.760
Thanks for this.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.880
The problem is is you want to be careful because if you don't sync it up right, you could end

56:15.880 --> 56:17.920
up breaking one or both of your arms.

56:17.920 --> 56:21.600
None of these suggestions are good except for the dick one, I guess is all right.

56:21.600 --> 56:24.600
But shoulders, thighs.

56:24.600 --> 56:27.600
Let me just, let me grab you right there, buddy.

56:27.600 --> 56:29.240
Let me get you right there, buddy.

56:29.240 --> 56:30.240
Little tickles.

56:30.240 --> 56:31.240
You started giving him a back rub.

56:31.240 --> 56:32.240
You know, reach around back.

56:32.240 --> 56:33.240
Shoulders.

56:33.240 --> 56:34.240
Shoulders.

56:34.240 --> 56:35.240
I'll just give you a little trailing horse.

56:35.240 --> 56:36.240
Shoulders seems like you're-

56:36.240 --> 56:38.560
Give him an Indian rub burn while you're doing it.

56:38.560 --> 56:42.040
Shoulders seems like you're trying to stop the guy and you're just very bad at it.

56:42.040 --> 56:45.360
Like that would be the signal I would get from shoulders.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.360
Maybe stick your fingers inside his ears.

56:47.360 --> 56:49.000
Maybe stick your finger down his throat.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.480
Hey, baby bird me.

56:50.480 --> 56:52.600
Hold on, there's something I like to do.

56:52.600 --> 56:54.320
It gets in real wet.

56:54.320 --> 56:58.760
Oh God.

56:58.760 --> 56:59.760
Maybe go for his boobs.

56:59.760 --> 57:04.980
That's one of the answer sleeves responded put her hands in your bonkers

57:12.120 --> 57:16.280
You are batting a thousand from for wrongness for mistakenness

57:16.880 --> 57:23.200
It's his insinuation that the best thing to do your hands is to take his hands and put them on your bonkers

57:23.520 --> 57:25.520
It's that the insinuation

57:25.520 --> 57:27.520
What are bonkers?

57:27.620 --> 57:33.960
What aren't bonkers? You know where you can touch a woman that will really drive her crazy, right? Where's that?

57:34.540 --> 57:37.500
Her heart. I learned that from milk money.

57:39.700 --> 57:41.700
I learned to fuck from milk money

57:42.900 --> 57:47.080
I feel like even answering these questions is heteronormative of me

57:47.080 --> 57:52.500
I feel like I should I have to keep qualifying all my pronouns and stuff because I want everybody to feel included. Yeah

57:52.500 --> 57:56.220
That's a good point. What if there's a girl making out with a girl?

57:58.220 --> 58:00.220
Sorry Justin. Slow down.

58:01.740 --> 58:04.220
Well, then it's like where can't you put your hands?

58:05.140 --> 58:07.820
Exactly. There's fun stuff all over. I don't want to be offensive

58:07.820 --> 58:09.540
I'm gonna walk a very delicate line here

58:09.540 --> 58:13.900
But there's got to be a moment where both girls go for the boobs at the same time and then they just kind of

58:13.900 --> 58:19.780
And they play patty cakes accidentally. Oh, well now we're just pushing on each other. Let's stop making out

58:19.780 --> 58:24.700
Let's just play patty cakes. This is way funner. I love this podcast is brought to you by Baptists

58:27.140 --> 58:33.420
We don't know any better. I think regardless of gender or sexual orientation go for the ribs

58:33.820 --> 58:35.820
Maybe little little punches

58:38.100 --> 58:44.420
Do those punches like she doesn't kill Bill where you put like your hand flat and then when you she's trying to break out of

58:44.420 --> 58:46.420
The coffin. Oh, yeah

58:46.420 --> 58:51.020
That's gonna feel trying to break into your heart call that's really gonna

58:52.340 --> 58:59.940
Accentuate some stuff, but all the wrong stuff. Just don't make out who makes out anymore. Just fucker. Nope. Eat some food

59:02.100 --> 59:04.620
You know what I mean, it's got the time who's got the time

59:05.300 --> 59:10.620
This has been my brother. My brother meets. It's a show that we do every week. We sure hope you had a good time listening

59:10.620 --> 59:15.860

59:34.500 --> 59:36.500
amazing theme song

59:36.500 --> 59:42.260
Our amazingly fantastic theme song for mr. David Liebhardt. Do we want to put that at the beginning of the end?

59:43.660 --> 59:46.420
I feel like at the beginning would be a more special way of

59:47.660 --> 59:49.300
Beginning the show

59:49.300 --> 59:50.780
Okay

59:50.780 --> 59:54.180
So thank you to him for for that. It means a lot

59:54.180 --> 01:00:00.100
I think he's really actually captured the spirit of the show better than anybody else could it's a collaboration. It's been long in the works

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.780
It's mutual

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:09.820

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.680
It's a departure off the album putting the days to bed

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.960
Thank you to John Roderick and the long winters

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.520
Still waiting on that new album. I know it's I know it gets out a lot probably but

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:42.380
