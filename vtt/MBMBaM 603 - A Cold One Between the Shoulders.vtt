00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.180 --> 01:15.220
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modren era

01:15.220 --> 01:19.300
I'm laughing already just get excited about these these jokes

01:19.780 --> 01:25.140
I'm Justin mackerel your oldest brother. I'm Travis the unappreciative I

01:26.100 --> 01:30.380
Don't think you can say that. I am I'm feeling it Griffin

01:30.980 --> 01:36.540
Yeah, but it does smack of like now appreciate. Do you know what I mean? Yeah?

01:36.580 --> 01:41.780
Yeah, why do you think I would say Griffin if I wasn't saying like I wish my brothers appreciated the hardware. Oh, it's us

01:41.780 --> 01:47.500
Okay, I yeah, I thought you were saying like the audience. No, I'm universally beloved, but

01:49.260 --> 01:51.280
No, well, I don't know if you guys love me

01:51.280 --> 01:53.960
I don't want to put though. I just know that you don't appreciate the hard work that I do for you

01:54.260 --> 02:00.860
Okay, because these day in day out. I'm deep in there mining that good content on tik-tok

02:01.460 --> 02:08.580
Curating a certain amount of like quality content for you. I texted you guys no response. Yeah

02:08.580 --> 02:16.100
Yeah, like I get I send you like two to five tik-toks a day. Yeah, man. I mean I mean

02:17.340 --> 02:21.700
Minimum I mean sometimes there are good days, you know where you go down the mines and you're like, oh

02:21.700 --> 02:24.660
I was going for 16 tons, but I got 18 tons

02:24.700 --> 02:28.780
you know what I mean, and then I send those tik-toks on to you and I thought this is a

02:28.980 --> 02:30.980
baby who makes a funny face or

02:31.580 --> 02:33.580
It looks like this dog is talking

02:33.580 --> 02:39.660
This man has dropped a pizza down the sewer and my hand came out of the sewer to get the pizza

02:39.660 --> 02:41.940
And now everybody's talking about pizza hand

02:42.140 --> 02:48.060
Yes, and I'm like you guys love this and I send it to you and maybe they're not going through

02:48.700 --> 02:52.220
Maybe there's some kind of data plan issue. No, they're going through there

02:52.220 --> 02:56.740
I only get tik-toks on nights and weekends and you don't send them then. Yeah

02:56.740 --> 02:59.260
I actually used all my tik-tok minutes

02:59.260 --> 03:05.020
Oh well, and then you guys don't respond like haha good one or I really appreciate all the hard work you did finding

03:05.020 --> 03:12.460
Oh wow, this tick-tock. Oh, wow. I mean honestly an emoji would be no that was me being surprised that that is something you expect

03:12.460 --> 03:14.780
Like expect would yeah, I I nod

03:15.300 --> 03:21.180
So I sometimes I even watch him which I think is is nice. Yeah, that's huge. That's a huge

03:21.180 --> 03:27.560
Thank you bespoke tik-toks that I have. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I've dug through

03:28.020 --> 03:35.900
Like the clearance aisle of tik-toks for you guys because I know that you have let's call it. What is very specific tastes

03:36.700 --> 03:43.700
You like very specific. That makes us sound like perverts. Well, I'm not gonna say it right, but you guys have

03:45.020 --> 03:46.020
particular

03:46.020 --> 03:53.460
facilities when it comes to your comedy videos and so I go through I find them I dig to the bottom I find them and

03:53.460 --> 03:58.240
I say although like this and I send it to you guys like I come to if you picture it in real life

03:58.260 --> 04:04.780
I'm cradling these tik-toks in my hands like a baby bird like a baby bird and I'm handing them to you like here

04:07.980 --> 04:14.260
No, this is like if the mama bird brought the baby bird like a Rubik's Cube and the baby bird would be like

04:14.260 --> 04:18.220
I didn't ask for this. I didn't I don't know what to do with this

04:18.220 --> 04:20.860
I don't know how to interface with this. Am I supposed to thank you mama?

04:20.980 --> 04:26.380
Now when you entered into a relationship with me Griffin you though implicit in there

04:26.380 --> 04:31.540
I hate the way that sounded implicit in there was when we began our

04:32.320 --> 04:34.480
Connection our deep intimate

04:36.820 --> 04:41.380
Connection you you had to understand that you would be getting these presents for me

04:41.380 --> 04:47.940
Like if you befriend a presence is a fun way of saying what I'm the crow bringing you a shiny button, you know

04:47.940 --> 04:52.780
And sometimes oh, it's a mint, you know, like 1916 coin

04:53.020 --> 04:57.880
That's worth millions and sometimes it's a shiny button and you don't just thank the crow

04:59.060 --> 05:04.120
When he brings you the mint coin you gotta thank him all the time, you know

05:04.580 --> 05:07.960
Well, let me just go through the lot of the most recent tik-toks that you've sent me

05:07.960 --> 05:13.660
Yeah, I'll watch them. I'll watch them on the air and we'll we'll know. Okay, so this is like

05:14.960 --> 05:16.960
okay, so this is like

05:17.680 --> 05:19.680
It's like a Willy Wonka joke

05:19.760 --> 05:26.320
You sent one that's like a joke about Willy Wonka about how the girl and Willy Wonka asks for a bean feast and that's fun

05:26.320 --> 05:31.840
Yeah, that is funny. So that's one that's one really good one. Thank you. I

05:32.320 --> 05:35.940
Mean, here's my problem trash. I work really hard on my algorithm

05:35.940 --> 05:41.900
Yeah, if there if there's if I am bored for a second half a second. Yeah a moment, right?

05:42.900 --> 05:48.480
If I'm bored for half a second, I swipe what cuz I don't want I don't want I don't want I don't want

05:49.060 --> 05:55.940
The algorithm to think oh he like this you want all wheat. No chaff. I get it. He look he like this. He like

05:57.140 --> 06:02.380
So what if you send it to me and I watch it to the end because I'm like why the fuck when he said

06:02.380 --> 06:07.100
You know, but the algorithm sees that and thinks oh he like it

06:07.300 --> 06:14.500
My don't trust me Justin of all people like one of two brother one of your two favorite brothers. Yeah, like

06:15.100 --> 06:21.300
Who do you trust the algorithm over me? You're trusting computers. My my algorithm is pretty much all

06:22.620 --> 06:28.220
Hodor fan edits from Game of Thrones set to like cool anime theme songs

06:28.220 --> 06:34.540
Yeah, so every time I turn on the app, there's there's just more Hodor and some of them is like here's there's some

06:34.700 --> 06:39.740
Hodor's funniest moments and then some of them are quite sad. Yeah

06:40.280 --> 06:42.660
Would you say more funny or more sad?

06:44.100 --> 06:48.420
What sucks is sometimes it'll play like a funny song and Hodor will be like, you know

06:48.420 --> 06:54.460
Picking up a big thing and you're like, I love that. Yeah, but then he dies. Oh, I don't like that

06:54.460 --> 06:59.740
Oh, no, that's a bummer. You know, I have a secret account because I've used it to

07:00.300 --> 07:07.140
My algorithm is so perfectly honed that I only get videos where people are picking up big hunks of ice

07:07.460 --> 07:11.660
From the top of things and smashing them, but the ice also resembles

07:12.300 --> 07:15.660
1990s kids TV stars. Wow, that's very specific

07:15.880 --> 07:20.380
Well, there's only about four of them and then they just like loops through them over and over again, but god

07:20.380 --> 07:25.860
I fucking love them. Yeah, I will watch I will watch Mark Paul Gosler's face get smashed on the ground

07:26.300 --> 07:31.620
Well, all four all four out of context is bad. Well, he's made out of ice in ice work

07:31.860 --> 07:34.980
They're just too long Travis if you sent me sick and maybe

07:35.780 --> 07:39.540
If the time damn Griffin, they're at most three minutes

07:40.900 --> 07:42.900
I'm not sending you war in peace

07:42.900 --> 07:50.860
You understand that the idea of me sitting down to watch a three minute long video on my phone

07:50.860 --> 07:56.060
Like when do I have that? That's the saddest thing I've ever heard Griffin

07:56.060 --> 07:59.980
How long are your bathrooms that you don't have three minutes to watch a goddamn tick-tock?

08:00.620 --> 08:06.580
How efficient are you in there? Pretty efficient man. I push it to the limit

08:06.580 --> 08:11.420
Yeah, I go in and finish and I get back to work. You're doing a full-text Avery

08:11.420 --> 08:18.340
I need six seconds. Do you realize that vines were perfect for me? Yeah, I know as I could go in there blast off

08:18.340 --> 08:24.860
I could watch a couple vine on your reinforced toilet on 12 seconds. Yeah, I have a reinforced

08:24.860 --> 08:30.180
I don't have some sort. I don't have like a special way of I do it the way most people use the bathroom

08:30.180 --> 08:37.060
Thank you. Most people don't blast off in the toilet Griffin your words fucking read. Maybe you should

08:37.060 --> 08:44.380
Read like habits of business successful business people my favorite book. Do they have it in a tick-tock form?

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
No

08:48.060 --> 08:53.140
They have it in vine form and the vine just says push it to the limit and then blast off and then get back to work

08:54.460 --> 09:00.900
That is that is shorter. I would guys believe Tommy Smurl fired me. I really it's still such a mystery

09:01.180 --> 09:05.700
Yeah, I had the shortest bathroom breaks at that whole company now

09:05.700 --> 09:09.620
I will say Tommy has told me many times about how you would announce time to blast off

09:09.860 --> 09:14.780
Loudly every time you walked into the bathroom and he was a masturbation thing

09:14.780 --> 09:17.940
The bigger problem is that I made my co-workers time me

09:18.020 --> 09:21.780
Yeah, all of them at the same time to see if their watches sick

09:21.780 --> 09:26.980
I wanted to make sure that there was no discrepancy in the timekeeping devices. Yeah, you can blame you

09:27.220 --> 09:30.620
This is an advice show and we're going to help you

09:30.620 --> 09:35.060
to start fresh this this spring to

09:36.020 --> 09:38.020
Step in and to

09:38.980 --> 09:43.180
Really just you know, yeah get it. Okay

09:43.780 --> 09:47.460
You know what fancy can't take flight if you're weighed down by the old

09:49.580 --> 09:52.860
Interesting so get ready your grandpa. Yeah

09:54.540 --> 09:58.620
I meant like the grievances of the sandbags on your fancy hot air balloon

09:58.620 --> 10:02.940
But no one in Moana when her grandma beats it. She's like fucking finally

10:04.540 --> 10:07.220
She's been keeping me here I couldn't have done this if

10:07.900 --> 10:12.820
My old sack of grandma was still alive. He made me squish her bananas in just the way she liked them

10:12.820 --> 10:18.580
I don't have to do it. Never again. Now. I'm lying on the back of her stingray spirit. Take me out of here

10:18.580 --> 10:22.300
Hey, Maui here. Give me that rock. I gotta put it in this lava lady

10:23.500 --> 10:25.300
I love that movie

10:25.300 --> 10:26.940
so

10:26.940 --> 10:32.740
Read me a tiny tale that we might answer Justin a tiny tale. Yes a story from a list

10:34.260 --> 10:37.060
Entertain me Justin and let me dispense my wisdom

10:38.620 --> 10:45.800
I'm an aspiring judge for the Berkeley Springs International water tasting held annually in Berkeley Springs

10:46.420 --> 10:53.660
West Virginia, I've heard of it West Virginia. I mean not the other part in order to prepare for the world's most prestigious

10:53.660 --> 10:58.860
Water tasting competition. Can you please help me think of some adjectives or phrases?

10:58.860 --> 11:04.860
I can use to describe the taste qualities of water and that's from your thirsty fan. Oh

11:05.540 --> 11:06.920
excellent

11:06.920 --> 11:12.940
Well, okay. Can you rate I feel like I feel like wetness is fixed

11:13.980 --> 11:16.960
Wetness is fixed. You've never had a glass of water and been like

11:17.900 --> 11:18.980
Wow

11:18.980 --> 11:24.380
That wasn't that was not especially it. That was not a very wet experience. That was yes

11:24.380 --> 11:27.640
I think for me, it would be about lingering wetness

11:28.340 --> 11:31.480
We're like for me. I think it would all feel wet in the moment

11:31.700 --> 11:33.900
Yeah, but I wanted to stay wet, right?

11:33.900 --> 11:38.940
Is that if you stay wet the wet in if you stay wet, you don't have to get wet

11:39.620 --> 11:40.900
Exactly. Thank you

11:40.900 --> 11:46.940
Don't you wish you've been there the first time someone was talking about wine and they drink and drank it and the person's like

11:46.940 --> 11:50.380
Mmm, very dry and their friends like what what?

11:51.840 --> 11:57.580
What do you mean it's dry it's like it's a liquid it's can't be dry and they're like no

11:57.580 --> 12:04.100
I just mean the flavor is dry and they're like, oh interesting. So the opposite of that would be yes, sweet

12:04.100 --> 12:06.100
That is the opposite

12:06.740 --> 12:11.540
There's too many letters in there my friends you're fucking up just like it's wet

12:11.540 --> 12:16.580
Is it wetter like why would you choose dry to describe the flavor of a liquid? It's so confusing

12:16.580 --> 12:22.420
Yeah, did you know I I'm trying to remember if it's one. Yes. I think it's in wine. There is a

12:23.020 --> 12:25.020
taste quality of chewy

12:26.700 --> 12:28.300
And

12:28.300 --> 12:33.620
No, I don't think you can just say like somebody said that and then like quadruple down on it

12:33.620 --> 12:38.980
So hard fun that everybody started to like question it right? Like somebody was like, oh, it's chewy

12:39.620 --> 12:44.260
What? Okay. It's chewy. I've got Travis has led me to

12:44.260 --> 12:46.380
a list of

12:47.700 --> 12:52.180
Esoteric wine terms from wine mag or wine enthusiast as it's called now

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
Umami could be a fun way to describe water

12:54.840 --> 13:01.500
I think that actually right what is water but umami flavor because it ain't it ain't the typical old

13:01.860 --> 13:04.500
Straight out the waterfall water typically isn't

13:05.260 --> 13:12.260
Sour, it can be salty, but I don't think you're drinking oceans water, but I mean sulfur in there

13:12.260 --> 13:14.620
Oh, that's um, that's umami right there

13:15.100 --> 13:20.240
Any water that comes out of the sink in Florida? That's umami right? That's umami

13:20.260 --> 13:25.020
And I think also what we're finding here is a question asker if you start any observation with oh

13:25.860 --> 13:28.860
That's blank right not to be questioned

13:29.860 --> 13:31.860
because that ooh

13:32.180 --> 13:39.060
Represents a my seasoned palette has made a right look like you can't just like bitter right? You gotta be like, ooh

13:39.060 --> 13:43.700
That's a spicy one. You could say this is a this this water is a

13:44.260 --> 13:46.580
Closed vintage it needs

13:47.740 --> 13:54.140
This water is not ready for primetime. It needs to bud and bloom and blossom. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes

13:54.140 --> 13:57.620
That's a bad bake. That's a bad. Bake is a one. That's a bad

13:58.140 --> 14:02.060
you know, I actually said that and I think we all agreed that I

14:02.700 --> 14:08.380
especially am like the girl from science where if a glass of water has been sitting out for longer than

14:08.380 --> 14:13.940
Six hours it is it is an impotable. I drink water from a

14:14.980 --> 14:18.500
Bottle, that's like at least a week old get out of here

14:18.500 --> 14:23.980
Oh, yeah, you lose your water bottle and then you find it later. Like I lost my world's best dad water bottle

14:24.380 --> 14:30.780
For like over a week on it this morning next to the paint next to the paint sink

14:30.780 --> 14:34.740
Wait, had you drunk out of it previously or was it untouched? No

14:34.740 --> 14:36.740
I

14:36.900 --> 14:38.900
Your bacterium we're just

14:39.380 --> 14:45.540
Coming around and I'm just here enjoying it. And that was the last they ever heard of Justin. It's just water guys

14:45.540 --> 14:48.900
How do you yeah, but your mouth bacteria goes into the water?

14:49.540 --> 14:54.700
Changes in all kinds of terrible ways becomes a paramecium brain disease

14:54.940 --> 15:00.500
There's there's a society setting up inside your body now. You've got if I can and I'll say it again

15:00.500 --> 15:04.460
I've said before I'll say it again. You got an osmosis Jones situation happening Justin

15:04.460 --> 15:09.340
I mean your osmosis Jones situation. It's like some it's like the thing inside it there like your eyes

15:09.340 --> 15:13.660
It's not a fun little white blood cell who like teams up with David high medicine

15:14.180 --> 15:20.660
Instead, it's just like a bunch of monsters that came out of your water. But if I don't I have the wonderful

15:21.500 --> 15:26.980
combination of not wanting to drink old water, however, I see it and

15:26.980 --> 15:33.340
ADHD so I'll fill a glass of water set it down and five minutes later

15:33.620 --> 15:38.540
Can't remember which of like the glasses on the counter was the one like what was I drinking out of?

15:38.540 --> 15:45.620
And so the only safe thing to do is assume they're all old. Yeah, cuz it's just why that's a good thing

15:45.620 --> 15:50.380
But why you just dump it out or throw it in the toilet or whatever cuz it's just water and there's always more of it

15:51.900 --> 15:56.220
On the planet the dinosaurs had where we need to we need to focus here

15:56.220 --> 16:01.060
Must you yeah describing water muscular water must this is a strong water

16:01.300 --> 16:06.900
That's a powerful virile water very muscular. Oh, that's here

16:07.300 --> 16:11.820
You can also make it really really completely subject like oh, that's a water to write home about

16:12.500 --> 16:16.980
Right and so like that's vague sounds positive sounds good

16:17.620 --> 16:23.860
Right and no one's gonna say to you. That's not true. Hi guys. It's me. Justin. I

16:23.860 --> 16:30.060
I thanks for opening my letter. I have to tell you about this guys. All right, I see God check out this water

16:30.060 --> 16:32.820
I sent some of it along in the envelope

16:35.620 --> 16:37.620
And enjoy some of the muscular

16:39.100 --> 16:44.780
There's a I have to read this from from wine enthusiast one of the terms they use feminine

16:45.060 --> 16:48.460
Then it says don't automatically bristle at this gendered wine term

16:50.260 --> 16:52.260
You can't just

16:52.260 --> 16:57.820
It perfectly describes wines that tend to be lower in alcohol and tannins. This is a quote from Ross Wheatley

16:58.300 --> 17:03.020
Perfectly Ross Wheatley director of food and beverage at Lucy restaurant and bar in Yonville, California

17:03.460 --> 17:09.060
Imagine a wine that has similar characteristics to a woman and her best qualities a wine that is light refined and delicate might be called

17:09.060 --> 17:14.780
Feminine the polar opposite of those so-called masculine qualities and wine strong muscular larger and bigger, but don't

17:15.740 --> 17:22.020
Don't bristle don't automatically bristle. Wait, can we explain it? So you can really really bristle

17:22.020 --> 17:26.820
You're gonna fucking bristle, baby. However much you're bristling right now. It's not enough

17:28.340 --> 17:30.340
Don't use up all your bristling now

17:30.780 --> 17:36.460
Let us explain it don't burn out on the bristling now. There's so much more bristling so much more to come

17:39.340 --> 17:40.500
This one really good

17:40.500 --> 17:44.100
I think the only wine term I like is sweet because I

17:44.620 --> 17:50.620
Understand that and it's what I want like if I'm being I would like a wine that tastes good, please like fruit tastes

17:50.620 --> 17:51.780
I

17:51.780 --> 17:53.620
Good fruit taste, please

17:53.620 --> 18:00.660
Listen, if there's any professional Somalia's listening and I hope you're professional because I don't want to meet just like yeah

18:01.300 --> 18:06.820
Please start I it would mean a lot to me personally if you guys would use gross

18:07.180 --> 18:11.940
But use it like it's a good thing like chewy about a wine is like, oh, that's a gross wine

18:11.940 --> 18:18.220
I love that. This yucky wine makes me want to barf. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, it's so rare to find a wine this yucky

18:18.220 --> 18:25.100
That's great. Really? Oh, that's a man. Oh when I drink this it makes me want to die. This is nice straight-up piss

18:25.660 --> 18:29.000
Love this. What is this? Oh, this is Magelmoor wine

18:32.420 --> 18:37.980
Hey, should we go to the wizard? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah wizards got something helpful for us today. It was sent in by deli

18:37.980 --> 18:45.260
Thank you. Deli. It's it's there's no name on it as wiki house staff. It was up. I wrote it. Oh great work trap

18:45.260 --> 18:51.020
This one had 42 co-authors. So a lot of cooks in the kitchen. I was one of them. I was the third

18:51.220 --> 18:54.680
Yeah, okay. So this one is how to flip someone off with style

18:55.020 --> 18:59.740
Yeah flipping someone off is a classic nonverbal signal for showing anger and frustration toward a person

18:59.740 --> 19:02.940
You might flip the bird to someone who has cut you off insulted you or otherwise provoked your ire

19:02.940 --> 19:06.300
Yeah, I'm not gonna read the rest. You guys know what it is means

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
Before we start can I ask just um?

19:09.500 --> 19:14.660
Um, do you guys have a most memorable time that you were flipped the bird?

19:15.700 --> 19:17.180
hmm

19:17.180 --> 19:22.580
Cooper did it to me one time real good. Nice. Oh, yeah, she got you. She got me when she was like a

19:23.420 --> 19:28.420
Like her fine motor skills should not have allowed her to isolate a finger

19:28.540 --> 19:34.280
Yeah, let alone her middle finger, which is not the easiest finger to isolate but she was you know

19:34.280 --> 19:39.580
I want to say two months old and she gave me a cold one right to my shoulder blades. I

19:41.540 --> 19:47.620
Still feel it when I was about 23 one time I was trying I was working in Charleston about an hour away from home

19:47.620 --> 19:49.540
I was driving home and

19:49.540 --> 19:55.020
This car I saw it out on my periphery pulled up next to me and then like on the highway

19:55.300 --> 20:00.780
Stayed like side by side with me for a long time and I was like, I'm not gonna look I'm not gonna look

20:00.780 --> 20:04.820
I turned finally and looked and this person is complete stranger

20:04.820 --> 20:09.540
No idea who this is flipped me off in such an enthusiastic happy way

20:09.980 --> 20:14.660
But like forcefully like I felt the impact in my chest

20:14.940 --> 20:21.560
Yeah, and then threw his head back and sped away. Yeah, and I still I remember it to this day

20:21.560 --> 20:23.780
I still feel it in my heart

20:25.500 --> 20:28.900
My friend steve-o who I worked with at Best Buy, uh-huh

20:28.900 --> 20:31.340
when the customers would be

20:32.460 --> 20:38.280
Really rude to him. He would wait until they'd turned around to walk away and then he would flip them off

20:39.420 --> 20:43.700
And he used to call it a cold one right between the shoulder blades. That's where I got that term

20:43.700 --> 20:48.500
Okay, I was wondering where that came from it popped out of my mouth and I was like, why did they call it that?

20:48.500 --> 20:53.280
Yeah, yeah, Steve. Oh Steve. Oh Steve. Oh did it? Okay, let's get into it. Give someone the finger

20:53.280 --> 20:55.620
This is straight simple straightforward into the classic flip-off

20:55.620 --> 21:00.740
Turn the back of your fist towards someone as though you were shaking a fist at them then extend your middle finger

21:00.740 --> 21:07.460
Yeah, hold the pose in this part. I don't ever do and look the person in the eye. Oh, oh you gotta do that

21:07.460 --> 21:11.500
You don't do that. No, I look down at the finger. I want to make sure I'm doing it

21:11.500 --> 21:17.020
Oh, I think my eyes dart from finger to eyes finger to eyes like see that get it

21:17.020 --> 21:24.180
All right, yes other hand is an option. Oh, yeah, I'm doing with my left hand, but I'm pointing with my right hand

21:24.180 --> 21:29.780
Don't miss this don't miss this somehow or thought you do the West Virginia or not. No, I don't know

21:29.780 --> 21:31.780
Come on, cuz that could mean anything

21:32.500 --> 21:36.280
Okay, so try using both hands. Yeah, whatever that's twice as good the double deuce

21:36.300 --> 21:36.500
Yeah

21:36.500 --> 21:40.820
It does say as sort of a subsection to this second tip do the X

21:40.820 --> 21:48.340
Cross your middle fingers into an X and hold them against your chest facing the offense. That's cool. I'm trying that right now and that feels really

21:48.340 --> 21:54.020
Oh, that has a Chris Angel energy to it for some reason. Yeah, I feel like that's how Chris would flip people

21:54.020 --> 21:58.860
Yeah, he would definitely and he'd do it with both hands and then he'd be like, is there a third hand there?

21:58.860 --> 22:01.420
Yeah, wow. Yeah, now it's more of an asterisk

22:02.140 --> 22:07.900
Switch fingers this one. I don't understand and I'm even looking at a diagram for a somewhat more

22:07.900 --> 22:12.940
dynamic insult flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession

22:13.540 --> 22:19.780
Alternately keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis. Oh, I see you go like left right left, right?

22:19.780 --> 22:23.860
Right, right, right, right. That's hard to do. I get cramped when I try to do that

22:23.860 --> 22:24.420
But yeah

22:24.420 --> 22:30.900
I feel like that leaves you open to really undercut the moment because then like what I'm like, I lost the hold on

22:30.900 --> 22:32.900
I lost the pace

22:32.900 --> 22:34.900
This is a good workout

22:37.380 --> 22:41.500
If I saw someone do this to me I would be pretty impressed actually

22:41.580 --> 22:46.820
Yeah, all right. So now we're getting into some discrete flip-off moves act like you're itching your nose

22:50.460 --> 22:56.660
They talked about that on it, what was the fucking show with Tim Roth where it's all about microaggressions and like you see

22:56.660 --> 22:58.660
Oh, yeah

23:00.780 --> 23:03.460
What I don't think it was bull yeah

23:04.140 --> 23:08.840
Okay, I don't think him Ross. I think it was watch. I think it was either bull or Bosch

23:09.740 --> 23:11.740
I think it was beep

23:11.740 --> 23:16.080
Beeper it was beeper Bosch or boop. I can't remember which show it was

23:17.140 --> 23:21.320
Act like you're itching your nose. We did that one flip the person off behind their back. That's a good one

23:21.320 --> 23:25.360
That's just that's some cold one real steve-o style the do the now

23:25.360 --> 23:29.960
We're getting sort of theatrical and this is the opposite direction and these I've never heard of some of these and they made me

23:31.100 --> 23:35.060
Fucking bust do the jack-in-the-box flip-off. Oh, that's a good one

23:35.060 --> 23:41.140
But you're like doing the cranking it up and it's like getting bigger and bigger and it does say here make sure you have the person's

23:41.420 --> 23:43.940
Undivided attention this move takes a bit of time to pull off

23:48.740 --> 23:52.260
While driving cuz you need at least one hand on the wheel. Come on. Yeah

23:52.260 --> 23:57.520
uh, yeah, well, you can put your elbows or your forearms sort of at ten and two and then yes

23:57.900 --> 24:02.500
Or how and fucking funny would that be if somebody tried to do that?

24:02.500 --> 24:04.780
This is the dent that I did it what check this out

24:04.780 --> 24:07.820
This is how I feel about and then the other person was just like I'm gonna walk

24:07.820 --> 24:12.140
I will leave before you can finish them by I'm on my way out the tool

24:12.140 --> 24:17.180
Okay, I'm not gonna receive the bad part of this maneuver. You can't trick me into doing that

24:17.180 --> 24:22.460
Practice the balloon hold your fist in front of your face and put the tip of your thumb in your mouth and act like you're

24:22.460 --> 24:26.820
Blowing up a balloon blow into your thumb and slowly extend all your fingers as if your breath is inflating them

24:26.820 --> 24:30.860
Then you hold the middle finger of the balloon hand with your other hand and you move the thumb away from your mouth slowly close

24:30.860 --> 24:34.180
The other fingers on your balloon hand until you only your middle left finger is so much work

24:35.540 --> 24:40.460
Yes, I I've always thought that that move makes you look like the silly one

24:40.780 --> 24:46.220
Right like that is blowing up your hand like a balloon doesn't it makes you look like a silly person that doesn't embarrass the other

24:46.220 --> 24:50.460
Person so much as it's like that's a lot of work. Yeah for what you've done to me

24:50.460 --> 24:56.740
It's like the holding up three and saying read between the lines, which I'm betting is on this list. It's not that's funny though

24:57.100 --> 24:59.380
Read between the lines you hold up all three fingers

24:59.380 --> 25:02.460
I like that one a lot because you can do that at school and not get in trouble

25:02.500 --> 25:05.380
This maneuver requires you to put your filthy hand in your mouth

25:05.740 --> 25:12.220
Also like who's on the losing end of this one the person who you have done the balloon flip off to or the person who?

25:12.220 --> 25:17.420
Has contracted the novel coronavirus you you are the one I?

25:18.140 --> 25:25.220
Also, I'm imagining somebody having this article open following these directions step-by-step to do the balloon flip-off like

25:26.060 --> 25:28.060
Hold on

25:31.220 --> 25:36.480
Pretend to find your middle finger like that's in your fuck. Yeah, that's good. Yeah

25:36.480 --> 25:42.920
Yeah, but if you don't find it though, that's gonna be terrifying and what's really fun is you can do this

25:42.920 --> 25:46.840
You could actually keep this going for a long time. Hey, have you seen it was right? No, I just had it

25:47.560 --> 25:52.240
But can you look in that? Oh, I found it and then they're like blown backwards

25:52.240 --> 25:57.520
Yeah, the longer you take the better if you can make it last a couple days. Yeah, I just had it

25:58.800 --> 26:02.160
Pull it up, but it's your ring finger. You're like, oh, no, shoot

26:02.160 --> 26:06.860
I thought this was it and what's great is you can do this one and it can be like a fun game for a baby

26:06.860 --> 26:12.400
Too, you know, where's my middle thing? Can you help me find it? Where's my where's my daddy finger?

26:12.920 --> 26:15.520
My favorite one and it's a little intricate

26:15.520 --> 26:21.080
It's a lot like the balloon one, but or the dragon box really but you don't I think it's less embarrassing for you

26:21.080 --> 26:23.720
And you hold up one finger you didn't make it kind of a show right and you go

26:23.720 --> 26:28.560
Well, I don't know that's the index finger but an unknown. Yeah, and then you hold up another hand

26:28.560 --> 26:35.000
It's empty, but and then you slam them together and that finger jumps over to the middle thing on the other

26:35.480 --> 26:37.480
Yeah, and it's like a magic trick

26:38.600 --> 26:44.040
Horrible that song for babies daddy finger daddy finger. Where are you here? I am here. I am. How do you do?

26:44.040 --> 26:48.860
You know that one? Yeah, but I think I think the daddy finger is the thumb

26:49.280 --> 26:56.440
Yeah, so but the middle finger is so much bit. The mommy finger is the index. Yes, brother finger

26:56.440 --> 26:59.000
I think is the yeah, because it's immature, right?

26:59.000 --> 27:03.760
That's that's the immature finger. It's bigger, right because sometimes dads are not as big as their son's

27:03.920 --> 27:10.520
Sometimes it's bigger. That's fair. Yeah, but that that the thumb does so much more work, right? The thumb's got a job

27:10.600 --> 27:12.520
What's the middle finger doing?

27:12.520 --> 27:19.040
Right, like if you think about it your index finger and your thumb are the hardest working fingers on your hands, right?

27:19.040 --> 27:24.720
That's why it's mommy and daddy that that doubt that middle finger. It's not really doing a lot, right?

27:24.720 --> 27:28.920
Yeah, I like doing a lot. Hey brother fingers should have been what we called the this podcast

27:29.720 --> 27:36.560
Fuck no, wait, we might have attracted a different audience. If we try on crowd, I think would be drawn to brother fingers

27:36.560 --> 27:38.480
Hey try the trumpet

27:38.480 --> 27:42.600
Blow on your thumb while pretending to play the trumpet and flow your fingers as though you're hitting the valves

27:42.880 --> 27:48.720
Periodically hold up your middle finger add some musical effects for style. Pretty sure I did see Ace Ventura do this one

27:48.720 --> 27:54.760
I think so, too, but also Griffin the way that you send the trumpet made me think you're going to go into Mambo number five

27:54.760 --> 28:01.600
Thank you. Okay good. Okay, our brains are broken in a very similar voice. All you said was the trumpet

28:01.600 --> 28:05.960
Yeah, I was like, oh, okay. Here we go. Monica. I said it that way all purpose

28:08.320 --> 28:11.740
Yeah, you're you're playing with our Pavlovian response

28:12.280 --> 28:18.380
Absolutely. I am this is honestly the reason why I included why I wanted to do this article because the last

28:18.380 --> 28:20.380
Maneuver is one I've never seen before

28:21.780 --> 28:23.780
Try the double extreme

28:25.180 --> 28:30.700
Extend the middle fingers of both hands then bring your arms behind your back and through your legs

28:31.100 --> 28:36.580
You should have both middle fingers clearly presented note only people with long arms can pull this off

28:36.960 --> 28:43.780
Okay, well through the leg. Wait, hold on around the back and through the legs. I see you trying to

28:44.820 --> 28:46.980
Like work through the physics of this

28:46.980 --> 28:53.420
It's like they're your middle fingers are basically going to be sort of pressed down against your inner eye

28:54.140 --> 28:59.500
While you are in sort of almost a seed like a squat while you're your middle fingers are

28:59.900 --> 29:05.660
Imagine if you were you squatted grab your thighs and tried to rip yourself in half

29:05.900 --> 29:12.500
Why instead of doing that you just use your middle fingers? It's very unpower. It's a very

29:12.500 --> 29:19.260
It's a very obsequious way to I think this one the double bird seems like you're inviting people to push you over at this point

29:20.060 --> 29:25.380
Unless the thing is here like I'm flipping off and I made you look at my crotch at the same time. Yeah

29:26.180 --> 29:31.800
Yeah, that's the oh, that's a good that's a that's a good actually I'm turning on this one. I like it

29:31.800 --> 29:35.080
You like it now. Yeah, I'm gonna do this to a bag to a bad guy

29:35.080 --> 29:39.460
I don't like another good one and it's one of my favorite also when magicians do it

29:39.460 --> 29:43.540
They see it in front of like a background right and the cards just seem to keep coming in their hands

29:43.540 --> 29:45.180
And they're like pulling them out of thin air

29:45.180 --> 29:50.340
You could do that with middle fingers to where they're coming from all what there's so many

29:50.340 --> 29:51.340
That's a good one, too

29:51.340 --> 29:57.180
And once again, then you're distracted when your friend can pickpocket them if I ever did meet the Pissed Man

29:57.540 --> 29:59.020
Theodore Cruz

29:59.020 --> 30:01.020
and I

30:01.060 --> 30:04.740
Realized that this would be my only opportunity to try the double extreme on him

30:04.740 --> 30:11.460
Yeah, do you think that by the time I started this maneuver his like bodyguards or whatever would take me out?

30:11.460 --> 30:15.980
Cuz they would think I was doing some like no, they'd love it. There's no way anyone who works for well

30:15.980 --> 30:16.180
No

30:16.180 --> 30:21.900
just imagine that imagines that the setup for the move of me like very quickly shoving my

30:22.260 --> 30:26.240
Hands behind me and through my thighs like are they gonna think I'm about to go

30:26.240 --> 30:34.400
You know, I'm saying they might they might think let's see how this plays out. Yeah, they might just roll a little bit

30:34.400 --> 30:37.720
I would need a photo like a professional

30:39.120 --> 30:44.080
Photographer like a senior pictures photographer on hand to me. You want to Jocelyn's there?

30:44.160 --> 30:47.680
They would pull out their phone and be like, oh shit geoduck. Hold on one sec

30:50.400 --> 30:53.520
We were busy laundering your pants for the fifth time today

30:53.520 --> 30:59.660
Cuz you piss cuz you piss like the feeling of the warm when it runs down. Did you say geoduck?

31:01.040 --> 31:03.040
The big clam

31:03.240 --> 31:05.960
That's not a Pokemon. Is it? No, it's a big clam

31:06.960 --> 31:13.700
Geodude geodude or perhaps Psyduck. Yeah, I kind of fused them together when those I've always wanted those two to

31:14.120 --> 31:19.780
Fuck, you know to fuck. No, it's it's about more than sex with these two. There's romance

31:20.520 --> 31:22.520
They have so much in common

31:22.520 --> 31:27.960
Here's you see did you see the piss boy in interviewing the

31:28.800 --> 31:34.560
Potential Supreme Court justice and he asked about a children's book about anti-racist baby. It's babies, right?

31:34.560 --> 31:39.360
Hey, hey, I got one for him, but the scorching real bad as babies racist

31:39.800 --> 31:41.800
God this fuck I can't talk about this

31:42.320 --> 31:44.760
The basil is new governance. No

31:45.200 --> 31:48.640
Does he do governance or does he literally just troll 24-7?

31:48.640 --> 31:54.720
He I think literally just trolls 24-7 him. He recently missed a flight at an airport in Montana

31:54.720 --> 32:01.720
And he got a little unruly and airport police had to help defuse the situation and then a day later

32:01.720 --> 32:05.320
He was like, I don't think you have the temperament to be a Supreme Court justice

32:05.760 --> 32:10.520
He's like shit and I I would love to just give him the double extreme

32:10.520 --> 32:18.680
Yeah, this and his and his mom wishes he was dead. Okay Wow, so Wow, just

32:25.040 --> 32:30.360
Okay, so here's some quick community Q&A question, can you suck your middle finger as an insult don't yeah

32:30.600 --> 32:34.120
Yes, as it can indicate that you're telling someone to suck it suck

32:34.120 --> 32:38.740
It is a rude sentence that may offend people. So try not to use it too often or around sensitive people

32:38.740 --> 32:44.740
Well, hold on now. Imagine this I flip someone off clear signal, but then I start sucking my own finger

32:45.060 --> 32:47.060
Yeah, my friend

32:48.740 --> 32:50.740
That's the most mixed

32:50.980 --> 32:53.260
Signal I've ever seen in my yeah

32:54.300 --> 32:59.580
Well, I get in trouble if I flip off my pet hamster if a parent sees you maybe or if a sibling sees you and tells

32:59.580 --> 33:02.100
A parent but a hamster doesn't know what human hand gestures mean

33:02.100 --> 33:05.180
You don't fucking know that just because the hamster can't respond

33:05.180 --> 33:09.460
The hamster can't tell your parent can't an arc on you doesn't mean that when you flip off

33:09.460 --> 33:14.980
You know little Jerry the gerbil or whatever that he's not like, oh fuck man. Yeah, you're close

33:17.300 --> 33:19.100
Bros

33:19.100 --> 33:23.740
Mmm, I don't want to yuck a yum here potentially, but is it bad to have a flipping off fetish?

33:25.220 --> 33:30.720
Is it bad I I would say that if I was ever able to give

33:30.720 --> 33:35.280
Theodore Cruz the double extreme I would get pretty hard

33:37.960 --> 33:42.440
What technique would be most appropriate when dealing with a difficult child behind their back will be the best approach

33:42.440 --> 33:44.440
They wouldn't see you so they wouldn't snitch

33:44.440 --> 33:51.000
Wait, how difficult and are they your own child because if it's a kid on the playground who's being a dick to my kid

33:51.240 --> 33:58.240
Yeah, I want them to see there is a chance though that you flip off a kid and like who's you know

33:58.240 --> 34:03.040
Who really like needs to be flipped off and then you have like, you know

34:03.040 --> 34:07.920
Like good will hunting kind of thing where it's just like hey, I needed that man. Thank you for setting my life

34:07.920 --> 34:10.720
Thank you on the right path. Yeah, you're right

34:10.720 --> 34:16.280
I am a dirtbag and I did trample your child on my never thought about that how I moved through space without

34:16.480 --> 34:22.320
Considering the fact that there might be other children who might in fact be smaller than me around and I've never thought that maybe I'm the

34:22.320 --> 34:25.480
Problem, but you flipped me off man, and you really changed

34:25.480 --> 34:28.560
It's like you were pointing up which was the only direction I had to go

34:28.640 --> 34:34.360
Right, you really turned my life around me and the parents come up the parents come up and they're like, thank you

34:34.360 --> 34:37.600
Thank you. Yeah, and now I'm a doctor and I'm gonna save your life

34:37.840 --> 34:43.920
That's you were in a car accident and I having to be driving by and the Lord works the mysterious ways man

34:43.920 --> 34:46.840
And you flipped me off and you were my angel and now I'll be yours

34:46.840 --> 34:50.560
I bumped you up the heart transplant list because 30 years ago

34:50.560 --> 34:55.400
You gave me a cold one right between the shoulder blades right when I needed it. Yeah

34:55.600 --> 35:00.360
And I turned around and saw it and you nodded and you pointed at it and I felt it in my heart

35:00.360 --> 35:05.440
And it turned me around that day and now in the president and I'm president doctor and I'm gonna save your life

35:05.440 --> 35:11.400
I'm gonna give you my own heart while I do the transplant. That's right. Watch I'm cutting it open right now

35:11.400 --> 35:14.720
And I have enough time to finish and go fast. Go fast. Go fast. Go fast

35:14.720 --> 35:20.520
Up. All right. I didn't you're gonna have to do the sewing up part yourself if you can handle that

35:21.360 --> 35:23.360
And now I die

35:24.800 --> 35:30.580
It's a beautiful story we just told doesn't and it was a true story I saw it on my Facebook

35:30.580 --> 35:42.620
And then the liberal college professor fell down an open manhole and died

35:42.620 --> 35:44.620
Oh

35:58.900 --> 36:04.580
You know when God wanted to teach everybody a bunch of new languages he did it with the Tower of Babel and now you don't

36:04.580 --> 36:06.580
I don't think that was the point of that story

36:07.020 --> 36:11.380
Yeah, that's how God invented languages, but now they're all out there and they're all done

36:11.380 --> 36:18.140
Babel is the name of the service b a b b e l it lets you to learn a different language

36:18.540 --> 36:23.140
You'll be traveling abroad. You want to connect a deeper with family. She's got some free time

36:23.140 --> 36:25.880
You want to expand the brain keep the neurotransmitters?

36:26.580 --> 36:30.540

Whatever weird things you're into and you can talk to him about it using Babel

36:39.540 --> 36:44.380
Babel has 15 minute lessons that make it the perfect way to learn a new language on the go

36:44.380 --> 36:49.840
They got 14 different ones. Not just the boring ones that everybody knows but some like off the beat

36:51.480 --> 36:56.280
They don't got Esperanto, but they do got Spanish French Italian German many others

36:56.880 --> 37:02.780
Obviously, there's ten more than that. Yeah, I just did the math the speech recognition technology that the app uses

37:03.300 --> 37:07.680
Will actually listen to you talking and be like, hey, that was wrong. No

37:07.680 --> 37:09.680
Oh

37:09.840 --> 37:14.120
It's like you don't even speak this language you can it's so weird in the settings you do have

37:14.320 --> 37:20.120

37:48.720 --> 37:50.720
short-sleeve button-up kind of person

37:52.080 --> 37:56.880
Yeah, I used to think that I was only a long sleeve button-up and then roll up the sleeves when it was hot

37:56.880 --> 37:59.460
Yeah, and it took it

38:00.120 --> 38:04.800
Took my friends at stitch fix to help me realize that the problem wasn't me

38:05.200 --> 38:08.760
it was that I wasn't finding the right shirts and

You

41:41.460 --> 41:43.460
Have another question. Yes, please. Okay, I

41:44.620 --> 41:49.820
Recently pulled the trigger on something I've wanted to do for months and dyed my hair green nice

41:50.260 --> 41:52.980
Well, I love the result and I'm very happy with how it looks

41:53.540 --> 41:56.660
I'm having some annoying comments made about strangers and friends

41:56.660 --> 42:00.940
The two that are most repeatedly said to me are did you diet for st. Patrick's Day and much worse?

42:01.180 --> 42:04.300
Did you want to look like the Joker? Is that really worse?

42:04.300 --> 42:11.900
Yeah, it's a little it's a lot worse Travis, okay, it's definitely worse I

42:13.700 --> 42:17.020
Usually meet these questions with a chuckle and an excuse about liking the color

42:17.020 --> 42:23.340
But they are really wearing me thin do I embrace this new persona thrust on me or is there a way I can dis

42:24.020 --> 42:27.900
Dissuade these questions remember being asked that's from not so serious in the Northwest

42:27.900 --> 42:34.440
I would say there's the third I should just you know, you don't have to embrace the Joker persona and please don't please for the good

42:34.440 --> 42:41.060
Sucks. Yeah, at least one of the tasteful joke. Yes, what about a lesser threatening one Caesar Romero?

42:41.060 --> 42:43.980
Yes, that guy was just kind of silly with big weird bombs

42:45.100 --> 42:47.100
Big weird weird bombs

42:47.780 --> 42:54.980
Bongs bongs. Yeah, probably and I think he painted over his mustache if I remember correctly. That's fun. That's great

42:54.980 --> 42:56.980
Let's crank some cotton on that

42:56.980 --> 42:58.980
I'll rip it

43:01.380 --> 43:06.740
But I think that you don't have to accept it and I want to know how I got these nugs I

43:07.860 --> 43:11.800
Don't think you can also dissuade it unless you like wear a sign or a shirt or something

43:11.800 --> 43:14.100
But I think people can ask these questions. You just like no

43:16.060 --> 43:23.340
Yeah, but no, but I mean here's the problem and and question asker you I'm so proud of you for going for it

43:23.340 --> 43:30.500
And dying dying your hair green go for it. But here's what the the sort of thing that you gotta you gotta

43:31.460 --> 43:33.460
accept is that

43:34.260 --> 43:41.900
People see things that are different and they are curious about it and they want to say something and I mean like it's an external

43:41.900 --> 43:49.340
Thing, right? It's not like you've privately started some sort of meditation practice or something. This is a public expression of yourself

43:49.340 --> 43:55.540
So you got to figure out why and it's if it's another person's business and you say like, I don't know. I just felt like it

43:55.540 --> 44:01.860
I did that stuff perfectly valid response, but you are gonna get people commenting on it because it's like

44:02.380 --> 44:04.900
That's just humans. That's how humans are and you know what?

44:04.900 --> 44:08.660
I think it's maybe not the work, especially if it's strangers doing it

44:08.660 --> 44:12.060
I think that's great because it's like a good opportunity to like I don't know

44:12.100 --> 44:15.020
You got the what's it as they say in the communication?

44:15.020 --> 44:21.700
World like you got the what's it just they they they start the conversation and you can continue it meet meet new people now

44:21.700 --> 44:28.120
It happens. It happens to me a lot that people will see my purple hair and clearly they feel like because I've done it

44:28.120 --> 44:30.060
I want people to comment on it

44:30.060 --> 44:34.540
And they can't think of something to say and people will just go purple

44:35.580 --> 44:40.380
Yeah, and then that's the extent of this thing five-year-olds trap

44:40.380 --> 44:47.300
I said, hey Griffin when it comes to social interaction. Everybody will often like devolve into that. Yeah, sure

44:47.940 --> 44:53.540
Another option is you could if they say did you get that? Is that Joker hair and you say no, it's actually

44:54.900 --> 44:58.020
Insert anime character here. Oh, yeah

44:59.260 --> 45:04.540
We'll stop the conversation in its tracks depending on where you are and who you're talking to

45:04.540 --> 45:13.140
That's fair because maybe you just started a new friendship. Yes. Um, it looks like the main boy in My Hero Academia

45:13.460 --> 45:17.900
Has green hair. So that's one for you. Just say I did it based on the the main boy

45:19.220 --> 45:25.740
Does Bulma have green hair? I can't remember. I thought Bulma was bald. It makes me really sad because I dyed my hair purple

45:26.340 --> 45:29.900
Because I thought at the time I remember I went in and I said

45:29.900 --> 45:36.100
I said purple like the Joker's and no one corrected me. I thought the Joker had purple hair and then no one

45:36.420 --> 45:42.220
Commented on it, but I was already committed to the purple hair thing. You got your hair dyed purple to look like

45:42.220 --> 45:45.980
I thought he was the last green. I thought Justin. I didn't look it up before

45:47.660 --> 45:51.860
Stop and let us talk. You've said enough you said it just I blew it

45:51.860 --> 45:56.540
No, you stop and let us talk when you went in to get your hair dyed purple

45:56.540 --> 46:01.660
You wanted it to look like the Joker who has green hair. Well, I didn't know I didn't know I didn't look it up

46:01.660 --> 46:04.660
I remember. You didn't know the color of it. Well cuz I but it's you're sure enough

46:05.540 --> 46:10.260
You're sure enough to dye your hair. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you had the purple suit but not

46:10.940 --> 46:15.180
I think that's what threw it, Justin. That's what threw it. Travis, I have I'm gonna give you one chance

46:15.700 --> 46:21.540
Tell me that you're this is a joke for show. Yeah, I need to know that it's a joke for show. Now Justin

46:21.540 --> 46:28.580
What does it say about your opinion of me that I have told you that I your 38 year old brother who has had his

46:28.580 --> 46:31.100
Hair dyed purple for like five or six years now

46:31.420 --> 46:35.780
Did it to look like the Joker, but I didn't look up a picture of the Joker beforehand

46:35.780 --> 46:37.780
And you're like, I can't tell if this is real or not

46:38.300 --> 46:40.380
What's that say? It's making me

46:41.140 --> 46:47.620
Re-evaluate a lot about my life. Honestly, that's true. That's true. Actually Travis. That seems like a new problem and not a

46:47.620 --> 46:51.260
Does it but yeah, no, okay, but this is a

46:59.540 --> 47:04.380
It's like a Halloween costume Joker and it there's nothing better for your

47:05.220 --> 47:09.300
Than just googling people dressed up as the Joker. Oh, I

47:10.180 --> 47:11.540
incorrect

47:11.540 --> 47:13.540
Googling community theater Shrek

47:13.540 --> 47:19.540
Theater Shrek is great community theater Shrek is if you don't have that saved as a Google image search. I would highly

47:20.620 --> 47:26.940
Highly recommend Google Google image searching community theater Shrek because they're all oh boy

47:27.100 --> 47:31.340
Basically the best there every single one is a fucking purple

47:31.340 --> 47:34.580
This one's a purple Shrek with a green nose and green ears

47:35.020 --> 47:38.100
Guy wait Shrek not purple. God damn it

47:38.100 --> 47:43.620
Oh, no, every image from community theater Shrek Google image search is funnier than anything

47:45.340 --> 47:48.180
Every single one you just can't get him

47:48.820 --> 47:52.500
Right. He just isn't gonna look right ever. Yeah

47:53.260 --> 47:58.700
It just all looks wrong. It all looks if he's not rich. It's just him being realized and it's not the community theater

47:58.700 --> 48:03.260
He looks weird in the musical too. Yeah, it's just you it's just weird to have a Shrek in real life

48:03.260 --> 48:07.340
Well, it's the it's the uncanny valley Justin where if you actually got too close to Shrek

48:07.340 --> 48:12.820
It's upset it right if he's bad if it's a bad or that doesn't look like Shrek. It's funny

48:13.140 --> 48:17.960
But if you're like that, oh my god, that's fuckin mighty. I wish this was a video podcast

48:19.220 --> 48:22.460
Can I just say Justin that donkey ain't great either

48:23.100 --> 48:26.980
No, they're all it's all it's all we should do a video

48:27.600 --> 48:30.620
one day of like community theater Shrek's because they're all

48:31.580 --> 48:36.440
Really? Yeah, we should Justin. All right. Here's what I want. Oh my lord

48:36.440 --> 48:38.040
Justin

48:38.040 --> 48:44.120
The next live show we do I want you to put up pictures and we have to guess which level of theater

48:44.640 --> 48:50.000
That is being performed at. That could be a fun game. If it's professional community

48:51.120 --> 48:55.960
Alternate idea is we just at the next live show all show up dressed up as Shrek

48:55.960 --> 48:58.960
Oh, I love the Kansas City is just around the corner

48:59.560 --> 49:05.340
We as Shrek country as they call it Shrek country. It's time to put our show to the test Justin

49:05.340 --> 49:09.880
Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna build an hour-long slideshow of different Shrek costume pictures

49:09.880 --> 49:14.780
And we are not going to reference that it's gonna play in the background as we try to do our show

49:15.640 --> 49:21.680
Which one is funnier, right? Well, like I we would lose that every time every show. We're going to go amp to amp

49:22.320 --> 49:24.120
Amp versus amp

49:24.120 --> 49:29.840
Battle of the bands us versus theater Shrek just see who is funnier. They look so swollen

49:30.120 --> 49:32.040
This one's got a huge

49:32.040 --> 49:35.200
Eyebrows something about it does why?

49:36.480 --> 49:42.980
Why can't the headpieces be that I'm looking at Alberta right now, Alberta Alberta's got some thick. We can't do this

49:42.980 --> 49:44.860
You know, this isn't for podcast

49:44.860 --> 49:50.240
I just have a problem with the headpieces seem like they were molded to somebody else

49:50.240 --> 49:57.460
And then it was a different Shrek at the last second. Yeah. All right, let's stop guys. Oh

49:58.320 --> 50:00.840
You can't just sneak into the room like that

50:00.840 --> 50:02.040

50:02.040 --> 50:08.240
Justin left so I came in and there's so many pictures of Shrek on here guys. What's up? It's Richard staying. Hi Richard

59:23.740 --> 59:29.500
Elixir like no one is like that. People are like, oh they let the cheese man in the club

59:29.500 --> 59:35.700
He must be bringing more cheese for us to enjoy at our party that he is not invited to Richard

59:35.700 --> 59:39.140
I want you to know you might not know this our show is

59:39.660 --> 59:41.660

59:41.700 --> 59:47.820
Yeah, I like to walk. Yeah, who would listen to me a lot by a few a few people, but I want to uh,

59:47.820 --> 59:49.820
I can solve this problem Richard

59:49.820 --> 59:55.420
No, this is a quarter great relief for me. I'm what you're gonna need and I saw this once

59:56.140 --> 01:00:00.820
when I was taking a tour of the underground bunker at the the Greenbrier in

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.820
I'm talking to my friends!

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:05.820
Okay, Richard don't you're gonna need to build yourself

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.820
I'm talking to my friends for a podcast!

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.820
Richard don't yell, please. You're gonna need to build yourself. It's Sarah man

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.340
She wants to be come walk on the beach. Oh, that sounds nice. Actually, that sounds better

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:22.060
You're gonna build an airlock kind of thing, right? So you can enter the house, right?

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:26.540
Remove your clothing change into non perfumed clothing after I've already removed

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:33.380
I don't wear clothing usually unless I'm going to like a funeral. It's basically just underwear and a gold chain

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:38.140
Okay, you're gonna have some vegetables that you praise. I get it

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:43.260
You're gonna like fully shower off before you enter the home. You're gonna be scent free, but only at home Richard

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.940
Yeah, it'll be like the Andromeda strain, Richard

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:50.460
You're gonna sort of completely distinct before you enter into the domicile

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:54.180
And then you can reapply you can have a shed outside

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:59.300
Of your sprays. Yes, just like a spray down sink room

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:04.940
Yeah, you could get like a like a spray tanning booth, but just fill it with your you know, your stings

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.940
Yeah, and then stink up on your way out cuz here's the thing

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.100
Justin likes

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.260
perfumes

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.260
Justin despises what he calls raw cheese

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:22.220
Which is to say any cheese that hasn't been melted in sort of queso nacho form or sandwich form

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.100
or

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.980
Thank you, Justin doesn't know anything about perfume

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:35.000
But I believe he is actually garnered a lot. He's Jennifer garnered a lot of just through osmosis. Yeah

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:42.020
Ah, right. Okay. Yeah, because you do leave a lot of it around the studio my ectoplasm

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.320

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.200
Uncomfortable is that his uncomfortable sound?

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.600

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.820
Absolutely, Montaigne saved my life

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:44.740
We have one time I was walking through a dark alley in crime alley and some thugs came and try to steal my pearls boom

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:50.460
There's Montaigne dressed like Batman. This is a punch. She lied. She didn't kill but she didn't

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.580
Know this absolutely it happened 100% It was the Dark Knight in Gotham

01:07:55.580 --> 01:08:00.340
The Joker was there, but he it was just he and I hanging out quick impression

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.660
No

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.540
Right now I want to hear your Joker we've been talking about the Joker a lot this episode

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:13.980
So, can you just do a quick joke? Do you want my Mark Hamill Joker or I would love to hear your Jared Leto?

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:19.820
Really good. I have a really good Mark Hamill took her. Okay. Okay. Well, let's hear that. Yeah

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.900
What's something that the Joker would say? He's like Mark Hamill Joker

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:28.380
Oh, hey, Batman. Give me all your money. I don't think he robs Batman

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:33.060
He was super rich I guess that's true

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.140
You know the difference between you and me? I'm not wearing hockey pads

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.700
That's what he said, but that's what Batman says Joker doesn't say that

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:45.880
But Joker says it to him in a funny way where it's like it's he's written the Joker is dressed up like Batman

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:52.660
So maybe it's just real for him the show's okay. So just just Joker ribbing Batman. Yeah, just giving him a hard time

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.660
But with buds do that's

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.980
You got some dead parents much

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.860
Wow, that's actually pretty

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:06.420
Good but really dark Joker really he's are very good

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.780
But I think even Batman would be like, whoa, that's fuck shit

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:12.860
It's kind of spoiler to say that Batman has said yeah, how does it wait?

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:17.340
How does Joker know that Batman's parents are dead cuz he killed him. All right

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:24.660
