00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:22.000 --> 00:35.000
It's familiar, but not too much familiar. It's a new craze.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
And the girls, do you want it? Just say, hey, I want it.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Did I interrupt the flow, you know?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Yeah, well I was kind of counting on the whole thing playing out, because that's the first physical exertion I've done in a decade or so.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
It's the most exercise I've gotten. Hi everybody, this is my brother, my brother, I'm in an advice show for the modern era.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm your oldest, most winded brother, Justin McElroy.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm a sweet baby griffin.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Guys, I got presents.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Candle Knight's presents.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
I got Candle Knight's presents for everyone who is sitting at this table, and nobody in the audience, I'm sorry.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Just this from here, Candle Knight's celebration.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
It's our swag from Genesis Today.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Now what do you got there?

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I got you the gift of health.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I got you an acai berry shooter.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay, I'm not gonna drink that right now.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I got you super fruit omega-3 gummies.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Wow, all for me?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I got you some goji, I don't even know what that one is, never heard of it before.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I think that's what makes you do backflips real good.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I was just thinking.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Tell me.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
There's a second back, I was just thinking since we just did another show,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
an hour of goofs, and we never tried to do two hours of goofs in the same day,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
that we need all the energy that we can get, and these have lots of B12 in them.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
So we got gummy vitamins, this is super fruit.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
We got five-hour energy drinks, which are not from Genesis Today, but I figure they get the job done too.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Also at the Walgreens, where I purchased some of this stuff,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
they have these at the counter, they're called Tropic Chillers.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
They're 17% alcohol by volume.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
They come in these delightful little spheres.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
They're little alcohols.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
They're little alcohols, and we drink them.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
That translates to 17% funnier for you, the people.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Let's do it.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I really don't want to.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
How is it?

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
That's straight gross.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Wow.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh my God.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
That tastes like radioactive urine.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
It tastes like the bad part of vodka night, like towards the end when it comes back to you.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
Mine actually tastes like someone was floating apple slices in gross vodka, and then someone vomited in it.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
I spilled Tropic Chillers with a Z all over my paper, so now I can't read them.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Oh, gross.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And we'll combine that with the five-hour energy.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I don't want to do that.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I think the gag was initially that we would jam.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I'm like, ah, look at us.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
They're disgusting.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm not doing that.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
It's repellent.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
I will drink a five-hour energy, and I want you guys to have the most pumped up.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Can we start a clap?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Can we start a slow clap for Justin?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Slow clap, people.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
A slow clap.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
I know that.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Holy shit.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
He's gone mad with power.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Don't encourage him.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
These are really bad.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
They're really brutal, right?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Let's get right into the advice.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I feel like we've stalled long enough.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
First bit of advice.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Don't do any of the things from the last three minutes or so.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Just don't do that, and you'll be good to go.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
First question comes from The Holiday Hater.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Are they here?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
The Holiday Hater.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Hey, everybody.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Hey, hi.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Well, come on, guys.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
That turned dirty quick.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
We've yet to do a live show where the audience turns on each other before they turn on us.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
But we will encourage that behavior.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Hey, everybody.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Turn on that guy.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Just got straight Hunger Games in here.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
The candidate from Panama.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Okay, so he says, I'm a Grinch.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It doesn't matter what holiday it is.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Fourth of July.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
He did not include candle nights, but I'm assuming.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Or anything else.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Just can't get excited for them.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Want to get excited and enjoy the holidays, but I just can't seem to.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
How can I stop being a Grinch?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Like things.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Normally we try to cut a little deeper to the bone here on our show.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
But I guess like things is a perfectly suitable answer.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Like every holiday?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Like Columbus Day and like Canadian Thanksgiving and stuff?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
What about Independence Day?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
When we beat all the aliens?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Can you not eat super fruit gummies during the show?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Sorry.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You sound like my...

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
This is my chaw-addicted brother, Griffin.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
He loves two things.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Bad advice and smokeless tobacco.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
No, but really.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Independence Day?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Not a fan of that?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
It's just fireworks and hot dogs.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
How can you not get into things exploding and also there are hot dogs there?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Wait a minute.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Is every day of your life a holiday?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Are you Tim McGraw?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Live like it was...

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Like I was dying style?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Every day out there skydiving?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Rocking mountain climbing?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
No?

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Well, you're here so I can tell that's not true.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Hey, I'm sorry.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I want to say that.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I love the holidays.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Why don't you like them?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Wow.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
What do you have against...

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Let me say this.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Do you have anything against them or is it just like, eh?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, I don't feel it.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Mostly good.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Oh, welcome to adulthood.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Guess what?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Nothing's as good as it used to be.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
You turn like 16 and people stop giving you candy and sparklers and it's sad from now on.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, and you have to drink chillers and five-hour energy drinks just to feel.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
We have a cure for your problem.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
It's called alcohol.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Get on the bus.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
They sold these like next to the paydays and three musketeers at the Walgreens.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
I can guarantee you carried parents have picked these up as a treat for their young ones.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Here.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Oh, they like this.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It's bright green.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
They'll love it.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm not even fucking kidding anymore.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
This is the grossest thing I've ever drank in my life.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Hey, Frank, I know he's our son and I know how this sounds, but for the first time I

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
was able to really just chill with Dylan.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
He just fucking hung out.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Me and Brian got some serious hang time on the bus.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
It was really good.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
We went and hit the jukebox, played all the Toby Keith songs, just flipped the table and

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
left.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
What I found in my adult life is all the holidays that I loved as a kid, like Halloween and

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Christmas and stuff, I had to give those up to appreciate holidays like St. Patrick's

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Day and Columbus Day.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
So you're saying sacrifice a few holidays so that the other ones mean more.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
No, I'm just saying like I've learned to appreciate I don't have to go to work today

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
days and I get to drink all day days.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
How do you not like those days?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
And Flag Day.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
What's wrong with you?

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
I think you're too broken for our help, but sir, I'm sorry, you will be issued a full

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
refund at the door.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
You will not.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I have a Yahoo.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
A Yahoo, you say?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yahoo Answers.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
From the Yahoo Answers service.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
From the Yahoo Answers platform that was developed.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I can't stop drinking it even though you know you have to stop drinking it.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I know, but it's like an experiment now.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
It's like mouth art for your mouth.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
This one was sent in by Alethea Eckhart.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Thank you, Alethea.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nevaeh, who asks, they have it backwards.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Hey everybody, by the way, cheese it with that.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Unless your name's Nevaeh and you're here, in which case it's lovely.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Who asks, what can I get a horse and dog for Christmas?

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
We're having a Christmas party on this Saturday, and we're doing Secret Santa, and I got a

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
horse named Daisy and a dog named Bandit, which Bandit is kind of old and only has 20

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
percent vision, so I can't really get him toys, so what else can I get a dog that only

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
has 20 percent vision?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Euthanasia.

08:05.000 --> 08:14.000
And what do you buy a horse for Christmas besides treats?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Horse treats, apples, sugar.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Hey, guess what?

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
That's the only thing that horses give a shit about, those three things, and not being kicked

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
in the sides.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Those are the four things that a horse is like.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I got you this necklace of roses.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
I like oats and not having a man on me.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Maybe you could get him a smaller horse and a smaller dog.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But you know what, even those horses give a shit about holidays.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Just saying.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Hey.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Just saying.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Get it together.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
They get a little extra trot in their gallop right around Thanksgiving and stuff.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't know what horses like anymore.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
In my day, horses...

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
They appreciated the simpler things, like Smucker's Raspberry Preserve.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
I used to have my finger on the equestrian pulse, and nowadays I just feel so divorced

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
from it.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
You know what you could do?

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
You could get the horse a dog present, and the dog a horse present, and then they swap

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
them, Gifted and Magi, and they become best friends.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
That's not how Gifted and Magi work.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Thanks for the watch chain.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
It's yours now.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Gifted the lazy guy.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
The Swapperoo.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Newsflash, if you're a horse, you don't fucking know that.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Just take it for granted.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Somebody tells you to run in a circle, you're like, okay, boss.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I guess, thanks.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I hope I get oats for this.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
We've gone, I don't know, five minutes without addressing the fact that someone got a horse

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
and a dog and a Secret Santa.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
What kind of fucking Secret Santa is this?

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
What kind of Secret Santa is there where you draw a human being saying, oh, whoo!

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Thank God!

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Someone that wears shoes and pants and stuff.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah, I got the short straw, looks like I got the horse.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Good news, you can give the straw to the horse.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
He will enjoy that very much.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Why is your response not, this is a horse.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I think there's been a clerical error.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
You have written Bandit.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
No, I entered the human Secret Santa.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm a human and I have a horse.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
This is a horse and dog draw names?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
What the fuck is that horse going to get?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
All I got is these shoes and like an apple.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Do you want this eaten apple?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Steven the human isn't going to like this apple.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Bad news for Dorothy and accounting, you're not getting anything.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Don't even buy a gift.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You're going home empty handed.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
How did the horse write their name on the slip?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
There's a lot of questions.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Why are horses even involved in the Secret Santa?

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
The horse doesn't give two shits about Secret Santa.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Someone's having a laugh at the office, I think.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Hey, Kristen, we're doing Secret Santa this year.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
The horse office.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
The office where horses are.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
This whole thing is taking place on Hey Dude, the television show.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
Unless this question is written by someone named Steven the weasel.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
You're saying that this is an Orwellian animal farm kind of thing.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Right, another animal getting presents for that animal.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
On the internet.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Wait, it all fell apart.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Can you get the dog an iPad too?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Everybody wants one of those, the hottest gift this year.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I got you Never Say Never.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Get some Genesis today, super fruit gummies, immunity boosting variety.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
For the horse on the go.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Horses need immunity, that's what I'm saying.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I have another question here.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Is Sam Panky here?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Where is he?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Hi, Sam.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Thank you for coming.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Sam didn't create a clever nickname for himself for reasons that will become evident soon.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
My name is Sam Panky, and I've been blessed with a pretty wicked last name.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Throughout my life, however, I've received the exact same nicknames and variants.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Spanky, Pankasaurus.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm going to call bullshit on that one, by the way.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
No one's ever called you that.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Pankinator.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
And my personal favorite, Panky Doodle.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
These are all great, but I'm looking for something with a little more pizzazz.

12:06.000 --> 12:16.000
And one that might reflect my life as a jazz bassist living and working here in Austin, Texas.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
What about pancreatitis?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Okay.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
That's a good start.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
That's pretty good.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
You've got to start somewhere, I guess.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
You've never gotten Hanky Panky?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
That seems like the most obvious answer.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Every day.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Every goddamn day, huh?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Stanky Panky.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
That's not good.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Has anyone just ever called you Sam by your first name?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Mr. Sam.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Excuse me, Sam?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Samuel?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Excuse me, Samuel Panky?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Is that you?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Never that?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
What about two in the Pank, one in the Stank?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
No, come on.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Jesus.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Whoa, and now I'm the asshole.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Can you not?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Like, can you not?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Could you?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
There's a hundred people.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I regret nothing.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Okay.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
You've had as much of your tropical chiller as I have.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
There's really no excuse.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I'm sorry, Mr. McElroy.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm cutting you off.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I'll tell you when I've had enough tropical chiller.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I'll tell you when.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
It's exactly when I say two in the Pank, one in the Stank.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
That is the specific moment in which I've had enough.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
That's my alcohol safe word.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
I can't stress enough how bad these are.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Don't drink beverages with Z's in the tile anymore, guys.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
How can I have Zima?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Sam, what about doctor base?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Now stay with me.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
You play base, right?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
You're a medical doctor.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Are you good at it?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
What about good base?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah, about average basis.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
Then if you have a really rocking knife, you're like, no, he was above average basis.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
That's good press.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
You can't buy that kind of press.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Set the bar nice and middle.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
You can jump right over that with just a few bum bum bum bum bum.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
That's what a base sounds like.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Just play the phrase.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I can't see my mouth.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
Can we get a nickname started for you that has nothing to do with any of your real names?

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Like Burger Master or something.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Now, are you good at making hamburgers, Sam?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
I'm sorry.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Do you eat a lot of hamburgers or are you good at making them?

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
You talk about burgers a lot.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Oh, there it is.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
What's up, Burger Master?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Oh, Burger Sam they used to call him.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Nobody loved him.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
The Sam burglar.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Take that to the bank.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
There you go.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
To the panky banky.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
You monster.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
See you go down to the bottom and while you're down there you find this with two in the pank

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
and while you're down there you find an oyster, you crack it open, there's a pearl like that.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
That's it.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
That was beautiful.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
That analogy you just weaved.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
Get down to the bottom of the oyster and you find a pearl.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It's so unpredictable.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
It's like we're with Flea at his prime.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
It's hard to know when he's got...

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Flea's a bassist.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Do you want a Yahoo to get us out of this?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Wait, I heard somebody...

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Did Flea die or something?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
I didn't know.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
No, he's still cool?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Okay.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Flea's still kicking?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Flea's still cool?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
All right.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Go ahead, Griffin.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
We're cool on Flea.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Thank you, Flea.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
This one was sent in by Nefariosity.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Thank you, Nefariosity.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user D who asks, an old woman keeps trying to get into my garden.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
What should I do?

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Does he mean a secret garden?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
I think so.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
She is not violent, but she is very persistent.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
She seems healthy and of good spirits.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Additional details.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
She seems of a healthy stock.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Additional details.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
This afternoon she tried again, but she was wearing lipstick this time.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Does this change anything?

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
It changes everything.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
So wait.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Wait, what color lipstick?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Ren is a game changer.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
She's obviously trying to get all up on your arugula.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Is that a thing people grow in garden?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Griffin, describe arugula.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
It's a purple fruit, like eggplant.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I know I've never eaten it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Is it a flower?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
I can't.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
So if I understand the situation properly, this man is looking out his garden window.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Cautiously.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Cautiously.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I can't.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
He's afraid she'll see her again.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Is she rooting through his vegetables?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
No, trying to get in his garden.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
She can't figure out the gate.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
But don't worry.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
She is very persistent.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
She'll crack that case eventually.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
She'll dig underneath it.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Not violent, though.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
She's not one of those violent garden crafters like you read about.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I gotta say, this afternoon she tried again and she was looking good.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Lip-wise.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Really hot.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Really hot.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
A real foxy grandma.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Everyone knows that old people keep away crows.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
That's just a fact of life.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
If you don't have an old people there, a weasel will come and eat your rutabagas.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Have you ever seen Rikki Tiki Tavi?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
It's about that.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Rikki Tivi Tavi and my nani.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Nani is our grandma's name.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Backstory.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Ah, the age-old battle of the mongoose and the nani.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
A few Yahoo...

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
There are 53 answers to this question.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Fuck you!

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Whoa!

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Fuck you, internet.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Because the first one couldn't handle it.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm going to summarize the thesis of about 20 of them who say...

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Summarize the thesis, though.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
They say, um, let her look.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Just fucking let that old fucking lady into your garden.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
What are you doing?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
What's so important?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Hey, you, get out of here.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Okay, that is a good question.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
What's your in-game worry?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
She's a carrot thief, maybe.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
I don't know.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
She's just going to start Godzilla-ing it all over your garden.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Grandma, smash!

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
I hide all my butterscotch candies in there and she's going to take them off.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
She'll find my stash.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I mean, lock your garden, I guess.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Like, what actionable advice can we possibly give this human being?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
It sounds like the problem is resolving itself.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
She can't get in.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
You're cool.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Unless you're worried about...

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
No, she's like the Velociraptor.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
She's checking every point of the fence.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Clever old girl.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
She's trying to dig under it.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
This is great.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
It is really good.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Where's the goat?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Just stick it out.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Wait, wait.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Is it a goat?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Because I get confused that way, too.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
This goat in a dress keeps trying to get in my yard.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Because if the goat is wearing lipstick, it has changed.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
The rules that you had before are evaporated.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Get the horse and the dog lipstick!

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Yes!

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Let's get these barnyard animals sexy, everybody.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
It's like a key to any garden.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
Oh, shit.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Sam Panky.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Maybe the lipstick-wearing old lady.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
That's a good nickname.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Lipstick-wearing old...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Lipstick Gma.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
No?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
I don't like it.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
You don't like it?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Hey, one of my...

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Oh, wait a minute.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Hold on.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Is Leviticus here?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Boom.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Leviticus.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Front row.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Front row.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
This is going to get awkward, but let's just stay with us, okay?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
It's nice.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Is that Argyle?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Yes.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
It's lovely.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Oh, God.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
One of my friends...

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
We'll talk more after the show.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Don't listen to these neanderthals.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
They will, too.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
It's not a gag.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
One of my friends...

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Did you go to my brother's and my brother's show?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, it was good.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
For, like, three minutes, they talked about old ladies and it was funny.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
And then for 45 minutes, they talked about Argyle sweaters.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
It got weird.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I asked for my $10 back.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
They refused.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
One of my friends is trying to introduce me to a coworker of hers.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
I feel like I should direct this at him.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
He's close enough that I can just stare at him.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I should just have him read it.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
One of my friends is trying to introduce me to a coworker of hers that she thinks I'm...

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Please don't look at him.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I was...

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I was actually just looking at you really closely.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
If I'm gonna divorce myself from him enough to goof on him, I need to not...

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Do you want some acai?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
If you could just superfruit me...

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
You want one of these?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I'm not...

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah, cool.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
You gotta come up here.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
I can't throw.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Hey, everybody, Leviticus, everybody.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Hey.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
He's getting his goji on.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
He's becoming too real to me.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
I can't goof on him.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
If you keep your mind to me, he's there.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
One of my friends is...

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I need to switch seats.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.760
One of my friends is trying to introduce me to a coworker of hers that she thinks I might

20:16.760 --> 20:17.920
be romantically interested in.

20:17.920 --> 20:22.360
I don't know much about her other than that she seems nice and that I think we might share

20:22.360 --> 20:23.720
similar interests.

20:23.720 --> 20:28.340
When asked if I had any deal breakers, I said smoking and it turns out she does smoke.

20:28.340 --> 20:31.800
Should I completely rule her out based on this one condition or should I quit being

20:31.800 --> 20:35.680
stubborn and just accept someone as they are?

20:35.680 --> 20:39.080
I've been single for a long time and I don't want to keep missing out.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.560
That's a really good instinct, everybody.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.000
Minutes, taking away, time to pair off.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
My biological clock is ticking.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Yeah.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Noah's Ark style.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
One by one.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
You have to pair off to die.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Pair off and die, everybody.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.720
Hey, are you sure she really smokes and she didn't just share?

20:54.720 --> 20:55.920
That's a deal breaker.

20:55.920 --> 20:56.920
Maybe she's trying to get...

20:56.920 --> 20:57.920
She's trying to comment.

20:57.920 --> 20:58.920
Did you see?

20:58.920 --> 20:59.920
That was her disappear...

20:59.920 --> 21:00.920
What?

21:00.920 --> 21:01.920
I guess I smoke now.

21:01.920 --> 21:02.920
I guess I smoke now.

21:02.920 --> 21:03.920
Yum.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.920
I love these.

21:04.920 --> 21:05.920
Smooth.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.520
This is the fresh baked tobacco leaf.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.320
I love how crisp it is in my mouth.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.520
Picked these up from my buddy Joe Camel.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.520
Yummy.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.520
Thank you, Joe Camel.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.120
Flavor country resident me.

21:18.120 --> 21:22.920
You know, there's a middle ground between being stubborn and accepting her for who she

21:22.920 --> 21:27.760
is and that's changing her to the person you want her to be.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.600
You could do like my wife did.

21:30.600 --> 21:36.120
Start dating a non-smoker and then convince them that they're not, in fact, a smoker.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.120
Three years clean, everybody.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.120
Flip it.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.120
You're saying...

21:39.120 --> 21:42.720
I want to go back to what Travis was saying because it was funnier.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.720
Funnier unless real.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.840
You want to flip it Eliza Doolittle style, My Fair Lady style.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.880
Did you say Eliza Dushku style?

21:48.880 --> 21:50.800
You want to flip it Eliza Dushku.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.800
Is she here?

21:51.800 --> 21:52.800
Eliza?

21:52.800 --> 21:53.800
Eliza...

21:53.800 --> 21:54.800
She was at the 7.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.800
She was at the 7.

21:55.800 --> 21:56.800
She was at the 7.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
You guys totally missed her.

21:57.800 --> 21:58.800
You guys totally missed her.

21:58.800 --> 21:59.800
Ask everyone who was at the 7.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.800
They'll attack.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.800
Striking young auntie.

22:01.800 --> 22:02.800
Who was at the 7 o'clock show?

22:02.800 --> 22:03.800
See?

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
They voted.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
None of them were Eliza Dushku.

22:05.800 --> 22:06.800
No.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
She had to go.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.120
If you can't...

22:09.120 --> 22:10.120
I don't think you should try a changer.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.120
I think you gotta change yourself.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.120
No.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.120
This is all it takes.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.120
This is all it takes.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.120
No.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.120
A couple of those.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.560
You throw like eight of those and she gets self-conscious.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.200
Did you enjoy the date with Leviticus?

22:20.200 --> 22:21.200
Yeah.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.200
He's kind of coffee.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.200
He coughs a lot.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.200
He has rheumatism.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.200
Yeah.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.200
I think he's got rheumatism.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.200
He's got TB.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.200
He's got a touch of the consumption.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.200
He's a lunger.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.200
He was a lunger.

22:30.200 --> 22:34.120
I didn't enjoy the time I spent with him.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.840
We tried to watch a movie and he kept coughing.

22:35.840 --> 22:36.840
I'm sorry.

22:36.840 --> 22:37.840
I'm here and I feel so bad.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.840
This is what's important to note.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.080
The fact that she smokes now is not a concrete thing forever.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.080
Right.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
You gotta change it.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.080
It's not like she has blue eyes.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.080
Right.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.080
This is like, yes, she smokes.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.600
That doesn't mean she's always going to be a smoker.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.680
She's going to want to change your taste in podcasts.

22:50.680 --> 22:54.200
It's going to be a give and take.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.560
She's going to insist you stop calling yourself Leviticus.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.560
Yeah.

22:57.560 --> 22:58.560
Right.

22:58.560 --> 23:02.200
There's going to be a lot of changing on both sides and that's what relationships are, people.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.200
Yeah.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.200
Just caving in to each other.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.200
Right.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.200
Finding out what you need to change about yourself.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.840
Can you talk about negotiation?

23:08.840 --> 23:11.200
Can you get her to cigars?

23:11.200 --> 23:14.880
Can you flip it and get her to smoke cigars and then you kiss her and it tastes like grandpa

23:14.880 --> 23:15.880
mouth?

23:15.880 --> 23:20.120
Can you start dipping and then tell her, I'll give up dip if you give up smoking?

23:20.120 --> 23:21.120
That's great.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.120
In between vomiting.

23:22.120 --> 23:23.120
Hold on.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.120
Hold on.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.160
I need a moment.

23:26.160 --> 23:30.120
Can you take up snoozing?

23:30.120 --> 23:31.120
Can you snoozing?

23:31.120 --> 23:32.120
Or snoozing.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.440
Or you just say everything in rhyme.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.520
Can you talk about the secret a lot?

23:36.520 --> 23:39.320
I don't understand.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.320
What?

23:40.320 --> 23:41.320
The secret.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.320
The book.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.320
The secret.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.320
Is the secret that you do snooze?

23:44.320 --> 23:45.320
Am I saying that right?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.320
Is it an umlaut over the u?

23:46.320 --> 23:48.640
If you snooze, tell him you're going to reinforce.

23:48.640 --> 23:49.640
It's a liquid u.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.640
Snooze?

23:50.640 --> 23:51.640
Snooze?

23:51.640 --> 23:53.120
I don't like how it sounds when you say it.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.120
Griffin.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.120
Griffin, save me.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.520
Here's a Yahoo that has nothing to do with snooze.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
It's by Yahoo Answers.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
Sent in by Nefariosity.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.520
Thank you, Nefariosity.

24:01.520 --> 24:10.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks, what do angels eat for my book?

24:10.400 --> 24:18.640
How to cook for angels.

24:18.640 --> 24:19.640
I'd read it.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.640
I would.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.280
I'd read it.

24:23.280 --> 24:28.280
That Shinerbuck is so good after drinking that orange jizz for 30 minutes.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.280
That's because of my asses.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.280
Made here in Austin.

24:32.280 --> 24:36.200
Guys, you got to stop giving in to me.

24:36.200 --> 24:41.040
I am writing a book and the girl in my book is pregnant with an angel and I want her to

24:41.040 --> 24:42.840
have something to crave.

24:42.840 --> 24:43.840
Help.

24:43.840 --> 24:48.280
Unfortunately, it's a biography.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.280
You're not writing a book.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.280
Let's be honest.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.280
You're justifying to your dad.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.280
Daddy is an angel.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.280
Trust me, it's an angel, baby.

24:53.280 --> 24:59.240
I'm trying to win a bet with my stupid friends.

24:59.240 --> 25:03.360
What do angels eat?

25:03.360 --> 25:07.600
Two different people in the Yahoo Answers platform wrote angel food cake.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.600
Good one, guys.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.600
Quality.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
Good goof.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.600
Nobody said angel hair pasta.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.600
Couldn't get another angel-based.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.600
What about devil's food cake?

25:13.600 --> 25:14.600
Can you believe it?

25:14.600 --> 25:23.120
Travis, if you make the jokes that are as bad as the jokes that are in there, then people

25:23.120 --> 25:24.120
don't have to listen.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.600
No, I said it in a tone of voice like I'm mocking them, but it's all I could come up

25:26.600 --> 25:27.600
with.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.600
Can I joke snidely for 30 minutes?

25:29.600 --> 25:31.880
Would you guys be cool?

25:31.880 --> 25:34.320
I think, like, anything?

25:34.320 --> 25:36.280
I guess anything they want to.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.640
Obviously, their teeth are made of metal.

25:38.640 --> 25:43.960
Roman Downey's teeth are made of metal.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.480
Fuck you if you don't believe me.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.200
I had a brief fling with her.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.920
What's the other lady on there called?

25:52.920 --> 25:53.920
Mama Angel.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.920
Mama Angel.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.920
I don't know.

25:55.920 --> 25:56.920
I didn't watch it.

25:56.920 --> 25:57.920
Angel's.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.400
I'm pretty sure I only eat cloud-based foods.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.400
So like cloud burgers.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.400
Like cloud burgers, mostly.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.400
Right.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.040
Do they eat like tacos?

26:06.040 --> 26:07.040
Cloud tacos.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.120
They can eat cloud tacos.

26:09.120 --> 26:14.320
They're not exclusively towards cloud burgers.

26:14.320 --> 26:20.080
There's a lot of cloud-based foods in this situation that I am whipping up live on stage.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.200
Griffin's out there on a bold new frontier, and he is writing the rules as we walk.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.760
They'll keep challenging me on this goof.

26:24.760 --> 26:25.760
What about cupcakes?

26:25.760 --> 26:26.760
God damn it.

26:26.760 --> 26:30.200
Yeah, they eat those too, but they're made of clouds.

26:30.200 --> 26:33.200
In this situation, I'm creating.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.240
Have you guys ever seen improv before?

26:35.240 --> 26:38.520
This is how it works.

26:38.520 --> 26:42.320
Normally we record for an hour and 15 minutes, and you get a 55-minute show, and these are

26:42.320 --> 26:43.600
the gems you're missing out on.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.040
If you could believe it, you would be robbed of cloud tacos.

26:47.040 --> 26:54.160
This is my brother, my brother, me, face-to-face, three, Tokyo Drift, the cutting room floor.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.880
You at home are not hearing this.

26:55.880 --> 27:01.080
So I could say, fuck anybody who doesn't live in Austin or the surrounding area, or New

27:01.080 --> 27:02.080
Orleans.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.080
Really?

27:03.080 --> 27:04.080
There he is.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.080
Good stuff.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.080
You know what?

27:06.080 --> 27:07.080
I'm done.

27:07.080 --> 27:11.120
Do angels have to eat?

27:11.120 --> 27:14.360
Do angels have to... Do angels... Let me bring it down.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.360
Do angels have to eat?

27:15.360 --> 27:16.360
Things are getting too funny.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.360
Slow it down.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.600
Let's have a really intense theological discussion.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.560
What do you guys think about angels?

27:23.560 --> 27:30.760
If I get to heaven, when I get to heaven, and I become an angel, because I think I did

27:30.760 --> 27:36.400
a pretty good job down here, pretty sure that's how it works, I don't want to have to have

27:36.400 --> 27:39.800
the onus of eating on me.

27:39.800 --> 27:43.760
Angels only eat because they're hungry, because then, actually, angels only eat to take food

27:43.760 --> 27:47.880
away from poor people.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.480
This is mine.

27:50.480 --> 27:53.720
This isn't made of clouds, I hate it.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.840
I assume you mean non-Christian poor people.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.840
Yes, yes, obviously.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.840
That's how they punish them.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.840
No such thing.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.080
But it's okay, because they don't listen to our show.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.480
Because they don't have iPods.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.360
What are you talking about?

28:06.360 --> 28:09.040
The horse getting a present made more sense than what you're saying right now.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.360
Our show is the 1%.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.360
That's all we're saying.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.360
Topical.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.360
Jesus Christ.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.360
Shit.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.360
Hey.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.520
Hey, I'm talking to this guy who's on my paper.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.900
Hey, I'm a guy who just went on a first date with a girl today.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.400
She seemed really into me.

28:23.400 --> 28:31.440
So we'll go out again later this week, and that brings me to my question.

28:31.440 --> 28:44.960
What is the Christmas gift giving etiquette for someone you just started dating?

28:44.960 --> 28:49.600
How much should I spend, and any gift ideas?

28:49.600 --> 28:52.480
You could give them a coupon that says they don't have to get you anything.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.760
Yeah, that's what everybody really wants, isn't it?

28:54.760 --> 28:56.440
They don't want to have to get you anything.

28:56.440 --> 29:00.880
Oh, a coupon that says, hey, here's a coupon for let's pick this up in three weeks.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.600
You're talking about a temporary breakup slip?

29:03.600 --> 29:07.400
Yeah, just like, we're going to take a break past Christmas, but we're going to kiss each

29:07.400 --> 29:09.200
other on New Year's, and then it'll be totally cool.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.960
So they're going to be lonely for the holidays?

29:10.960 --> 29:15.120
No, because they have someone else, but just on layaway.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.320
Such an asshole.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.240
Hey, don't start dating people now.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.240
What's wrong with you?

29:22.240 --> 29:25.320
Okay, like November 30th should be a cutoff.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.840
Right, earlier than that.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.860
Earlier than that, I'm saying Halloween.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.880
You don't want to do the- You know what, let's just say June.

29:31.880 --> 29:36.600
If you haven't found them by June, you get their number and say, I'll call you in February.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.600
No, no, March.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
March, not February.

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
After February 15th.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
Shit.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.600
I'll call you February 15th.

29:42.600 --> 29:47.360
Remember, remember the Ides of February, because then you can hook up.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.920
But please don't forget my name, girl.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.920
I talked to you once.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.420
Hey, you're a down girl.

29:52.420 --> 29:53.420
I'm enjoying this.

29:53.420 --> 29:54.420
I will catch you in March.

29:54.420 --> 29:57.560
Wait, then you have to text them every couple of days and be like, just so you know, only

29:57.560 --> 29:59.360
a couple more weeks till we can talk again.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.720
Got my name on you.

30:01.720 --> 30:06.040
I like that idea, because I like the mental image of somebody being like, oh fuck, it's

30:06.040 --> 30:07.040
June 25th.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.040
I better get on it.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.880
I'm going to be lonely for the rest of the year.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.040
Who am I going to spend Independence Day with?

30:13.040 --> 30:16.040
Not that I give a fuck, because I hate all holidays.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.040
Monster.

30:17.040 --> 30:23.000
And then we invent a new holiday on June 30th called Last Call Day.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.960
That would be- Holy shit.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.880
That would turn the whole game on its ear.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.040
The whole game of love.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.040
You're welcome, homework.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.520
No, it's not homework.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.120
It's dudes who are like, oh, I got to get down.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.680
It's the 30th.

30:34.680 --> 30:35.960
Everyone's going to be window shopping.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.520
It's the last call day.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.240
Just stand on a mound with some pretty shells and do your mating call.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.240
Don't even do that.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.180
Just walk out on the sidewalk and people are going to run to you like they're picking partners

30:44.180 --> 30:45.180
for Cotillion.

30:45.180 --> 30:46.180
Like, come here.

30:46.180 --> 30:47.480
I'm ready.

30:47.480 --> 30:48.480
I'm ready for you.

30:48.480 --> 30:54.280
I'm the best you'll ever do till February 15th or so, and I'll catch you then.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.280
Just listen.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.280
This is easy stuff.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.040
Just get them something related to the holiday.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.040
Yeah.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.040
Christmas.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.040
Get them like a- Well, find out.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.600
How about the promise that you don't have to meet your parents?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.320
Well, that's a good start.

31:05.320 --> 31:09.920
Christmas, you get them like a stocking.

31:09.920 --> 31:10.920
That's great.

31:10.920 --> 31:11.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.000
No, Christmas, you get them a stocking.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Like one sock.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.640
Yeah, like a sock.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.680
For Hanukkah, you get them a dre- Like a dre-

31:20.680 --> 31:21.680
A dre- A dreidel.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.680
Like a what?

31:22.680 --> 31:23.680
Dreidel?

31:23.680 --> 31:24.680
A dreidel?

31:24.680 --> 31:25.680
That's good, Justin.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.680
Wait, hold on.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.680
What's a dreidel, Justin?

31:27.680 --> 31:28.680
Dreidel?

31:28.680 --> 31:32.480
It's made out of clay.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.800
It is a- A dreidel, actually, is a purple eggplant-like fruit.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.880
How many people know that?

31:38.880 --> 31:43.400
That hates holidays, and is a fine- Justin, can you get me a Kwanzaa and also

31:43.400 --> 31:45.200
a Ramadan icon?

31:45.200 --> 31:46.200
Yeah.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.720
Kwanzaa, you will want to get them a Kwanzaa cube.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.560
I just can't solve this Kwanzaa cube.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.160
I got all the red ones matched up.

31:59.160 --> 32:02.760
It's a puzzle-based cube that you give to someone for Kwanzaa.

32:02.760 --> 32:11.080
That was left there by the Transformers.

32:11.080 --> 32:18.400
The only way to stop the Decepticons- Sam Witwicky, you must take this Kwanzaa cube

32:18.400 --> 32:21.640
to the head of Mount Inotron.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.680
Take it to the peak, Sam Witwicky.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.920
Hold the Kwanzaa cube above your head.

32:26.920 --> 32:32.720
Ignore that Christmas is way better, in many ways.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.480
Stick by your convictions, Sam Witwicky.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.480
Keep an open mind, Sam Witwicky.

32:37.480 --> 32:38.480
It's just as good.

32:38.480 --> 32:43.480
This is getting weird for everyone, Sam Witwicky.

32:43.480 --> 32:47.600
Have some awkward conversations with your school friends, Sam Witwicky.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.240
These are our convictions.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.240
Transformers only celebrate Kwanzaa, Sam Witwicky.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.240
And Ramadan.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.240
And Ramadan.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.160
Hey, how about a yahoo?

32:57.160 --> 32:58.160
Yeah, please.

32:58.160 --> 33:01.160
Because I feel like we're like- Hey, sorry, everyone.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.400
We're leaning towards unplayable for fun.

33:03.400 --> 33:09.760
We just offended both all humans and autobots.

33:09.760 --> 33:13.600
We're quickly moving towards the fact that Ramadan sounds like a Transformer name, and

33:13.600 --> 33:16.600
then we're going to talk about what kind of Transformer Ramadan is.

33:16.600 --> 33:20.800
It's a smartphone that transforms and it's Ramadan-gle.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.600
And obviously the correct answer is Ramabong.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
That was incorrect.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.600
I'm sorry.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.600
Ramabong?

33:27.600 --> 33:28.600
Anybody?

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600
Is that good?

33:29.600 --> 33:30.600
Pretty good?

33:30.600 --> 33:31.600
This yahoo answer was- I don't know what religion I'm offending.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.400
I hope it's not one of the ones that- All of them!

33:34.400 --> 33:37.400
This one's the happy ones, right?

33:37.400 --> 33:42.320
The autobots versus the Decepticons versus the Ramagons.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.440
It's a three-way war.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.200
No one knows who's going to come out on top.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.360
I can't believe you finished your chocolate chillers.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.360
As it turns out, it's Sam Witwicky.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.360
Okay.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
Go ahead.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.360
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.360
Thank you, Jacob Locker.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.360
Thank you, Jacob.

33:55.360 --> 33:56.360
Somebody wooed for him.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.360
Good work, Jacob Locker.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.280
It's by yahoo answer's user.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.280
It got cut off.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.920
NYC, trim, eye, and then an ellipses.

34:02.920 --> 34:03.920
I don't want to know the rest.

34:03.920 --> 34:04.920
I don't either.

34:04.920 --> 34:09.920
That guy asks, why are these cows yelling?

34:09.920 --> 34:15.800
Like he's stabbing them and they won't shut up.

34:15.800 --> 34:20.080
I live out in a field close to some farms.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.880
How do you have the internet?

34:23.880 --> 34:26.400
Not near a field.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.400
Is up on it.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.520
Close to some farms.

34:28.520 --> 34:33.640
It's a full moon outside and these cows are making these loud screaming sounds.

34:33.640 --> 34:39.040
Do they do this on full moons or is it just them being killed by a predator?

34:39.040 --> 34:42.520
Or the predator.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.240
These tropical chillers are strong.

34:44.240 --> 34:49.840
Have you seen that new movie, Cow vs. Predator?

34:49.840 --> 34:52.760
That's actually how The Catch Predator got its start.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.200
Did anybody listen for the screams of cows?

34:55.200 --> 34:59.360
You know, I would like to think that most people when they heard this question are thinking

34:59.360 --> 35:03.600
like the cows are sitting there going, but I said they're going, the cows are going,

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
stop.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
Please help.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.600
Help me, I'm a cow.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.600
I'm being stabbed.

35:07.600 --> 35:11.600
Someone forgot to give me a gift for Secret Santa.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.760
My feelings were wicked hurt.

35:14.760 --> 35:19.480
Did anybody here have the kind of rural upbringing that would be required to shed some insight

35:19.480 --> 35:20.480
on this situation?

35:20.480 --> 35:23.000
Do cows actually scream at the full moon?

35:23.000 --> 35:29.680
Do people, I should fucking hope not, but if you had told me that, I would have stood

35:29.680 --> 35:32.120
up and walked right out that door and never looked back.

35:32.120 --> 35:36.480
And now I have a new crusade to destroy cows.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.080
So wait, so they do scream.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.240
Do they just move super loud?

35:40.240 --> 35:41.240
Jesus.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.240
That sounds.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.240
One more time.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.240
Everybody quiet.

35:45.240 --> 35:49.200
Can you come up to the microphone and recreate that sound for them?

35:49.200 --> 35:50.720
Get up here right now.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.120
This is for our radio audience at home.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.960
Everybody, this is a howl at the moon.

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
Say your name first.

35:56.960 --> 35:57.960
Introduce yourself to America.

35:57.960 --> 35:58.960
Kate.

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
Kate.

35:59.960 --> 36:05.600
And this is the sound of a screaming cow.

36:05.600 --> 36:09.040
We're going to loop this and sound it as one of those tranquil tapes.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.660
This is a full moon hate cow.

36:12.660 --> 36:15.480
This is the sound a cow makes.

36:15.480 --> 36:25.000
That was awful, the worst speaking sound ever.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.760
Now, y'all, I always wonder things about like, how do we get milk?

36:30.760 --> 36:31.760
How did that start?

36:31.760 --> 36:36.240
And I think if you heard a cow making that sound, you're going to try anything.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.240
You know what I want to do?

36:37.240 --> 36:40.840
I'm going to squeeze these pink things and drink what comes out because fuck, I don't,

36:40.840 --> 36:42.200
I have to try something.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.800
I've always been looking for a way to justify hamburgers.

36:44.800 --> 36:45.800
Yeah, right.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.480
It's our only defense.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.480
You make that sound one more fucking time.

36:49.480 --> 36:50.480
I'm getting the A1.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.080
Well, they're not screaming.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.400
Are they screaming racist slurs, these cows?

36:54.400 --> 36:56.960
Is that how you want to eat them to punish them?

36:56.960 --> 36:57.960
What?

36:57.960 --> 36:58.960
Punk cows.

36:58.960 --> 36:59.960
What?

36:59.960 --> 37:02.200
I was imagining the cow screaming racist slurs.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.200
It didn't make any sense.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.360
I just liked the mental image of it.

37:04.360 --> 37:07.080
Next time, just maybe give me, is there a hand signal we can work out to let me know

37:07.080 --> 37:08.320
you're going down a road like that?

37:08.320 --> 37:09.320
Sure.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.320
Can we jump back real quick?

37:10.320 --> 37:13.240
Because I said punk cows and now I want to make a joke about them standing around wearing

37:13.240 --> 37:14.240
leather.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.240
Okay.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.240
Let's find it.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.240
Okay.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.240
Do you know how you know they're punk cows?

37:18.240 --> 37:19.240
How Travis?

37:19.240 --> 37:20.240
That sounded like a transformer.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.240
Tell us how now.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.240
How do they, how do they know?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.240
They stand around wearing leather.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.240
That's it.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.240
That's just their skin.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.240
Don't.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.240
Pretty good.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.240
Pretty good.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.240
Thank you, everyone.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.240
Pretty good.

37:30.240 --> 37:33.320
But are the cows, the question is why are these cows yelling?

37:33.320 --> 37:34.320
It's a trick.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.320
What are cows?

37:35.320 --> 37:36.320
Come out here, Steve.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.320
Steve, we have presents.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.320
We can't.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.320
Be cool, guys.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.320
Be cool.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.320
He's coming.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.320
Steve, what are you doing?

37:42.320 --> 37:44.320
Be cool.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.320
Steve, we can't work the VCR.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.320
Come out here, Steve.

37:46.320 --> 37:49.320
It's just flashing 12 again.

37:49.320 --> 37:53.320
Tell them that funny story you were telling me earlier, Steve.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.320
Shh, shh.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.320
I don't tell it like you tell it.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.320
Come out.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.320
Steve.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.320
When he gets out here, we eat him, right, guys?

38:00.320 --> 38:01.320
Now, that's my problem.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.320
I don't think cows do that usually.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.320
Only on the full moon.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.320
Cows that scream, booze.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.320
On the full moon.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.320
There it is.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.320
Move it along.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.320
Are you going to eat it?

38:09.320 --> 38:12.320
Yes, move it along.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.320
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:13.320 --> 38:16.320
You fucking dare.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.320
Fuck.

38:18.320 --> 38:22.320
We know who the crowd favorite is.

38:22.320 --> 38:25.320
Yeah, two people managed to applaud.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.320
Enjoy your night alone.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.320
I hate your guts.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.320
You're out of the family.

38:30.320 --> 38:31.320
I'm just kidding.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.320
I love you.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.320
They're booing you now.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.320
Guys, wait, wait, wait.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.320
Listen, they're still booing.

38:37.320 --> 38:38.320
Let's take a second.

38:38.320 --> 38:42.320
They're mooing.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.320
I just turned Justin into a little girl, everyone.

38:45.320 --> 38:49.320
You brilliant son of a bitch.

38:49.320 --> 38:52.320
You got Mad Libs for us so you can bust out?

38:52.320 --> 38:56.320
Let's just keep this shame train a rolling.

38:56.320 --> 38:57.320
Don't actually do it.

38:57.320 --> 38:59.320
I can freestyle one.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.320
Who's got words?

39:00.320 --> 39:01.320
No, stop it.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.320
How about another Yahoo?

39:02.320 --> 39:03.320
No, wait, OK.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.320
No, no, if you've got shit, let's do your shit.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.320
No, please go right ahead.

39:06.320 --> 39:07.320
OK, fine.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.320
This one's sent by Galiayali.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.320
Thank you, Gali.

39:09.320 --> 39:12.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Totally Awesome, who says.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.320
Nope.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.320
I don't know what the question says.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.320
I'm going to predict that is an inaccurate username.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.320
But go right ahead.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.320
Unless the question is, how do I stop being so totally awesome?

39:23.320 --> 39:24.320
I'm embarrassing my friends.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.320
Help me, Yahoo.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.320
Is it a sin to have sex with a robot for the purposes of procreation?

39:28.320 --> 39:29.320
OK, I was right.

39:29.320 --> 39:32.320
It's not a sin.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.320
It's just really misguided.

39:35.320 --> 39:38.320
You know how some couples cannot have children?

39:38.320 --> 39:41.320
You know, because of an immune reaction by the mother?

39:41.320 --> 39:43.320
However, the husband could fertilize the wife's egg,

39:43.320 --> 39:47.320
and a child could be born if it is placed in a surrogate mother, right?

39:47.320 --> 39:51.320
Well, what if the surrogate mother is an Android robot,

39:51.320 --> 39:53.320
a robot that is holding the wife's egg?

39:53.320 --> 39:58.320
Could the husband have sex with the robot in order for the couple to have a child?

39:58.320 --> 40:00.320
But what my book presupposes is...

40:00.320 --> 40:01.320
What if it...

40:01.320 --> 40:03.320
Listen, listen, listen.

40:03.320 --> 40:08.320
There's a guy who watched the movie Surrogates and got really confused.

40:08.320 --> 40:10.320
Why do you have to put it...

40:10.320 --> 40:13.320
Why can't you just like fucking put it in a Petri dish?

40:13.320 --> 40:15.320
Why does it have to be inside of an Android?

40:15.320 --> 40:16.320
Or like another human!

40:16.320 --> 40:20.320
Why do you have to have sex with an Android to do this thing?

40:20.320 --> 40:22.320
Griffin, you don't have to answer the question.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.320
I'm so sorry.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.320
Is it a sin?

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
Obviously, God didn't know about robots.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.320
That's true.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.320
No one knew about robots.

40:29.320 --> 40:34.320
John, Mark, Matthew, Luke, Ringo, no one...

40:34.320 --> 40:36.320
None of them knew about robots.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.320
So it can't be a sin.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.320
That's why...

40:38.320 --> 40:39.320
There are...

40:39.320 --> 40:41.320
There's a lot of shit that God don't know about.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.320
That's what you're saying.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.320
Robots, the internet.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.320
Yeah.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.320
God doesn't know...

40:45.320 --> 40:47.320
You can jerk it to e-porn and the Bible can't say anything about it

40:47.320 --> 40:48.320
because the Bible doesn't know about the internet.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.320
Right.

40:49.320 --> 40:50.320
That's why we...

40:50.320 --> 40:53.320
My brother and my brother and me are writing Bible 2.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.320
We're writing the cyber Bible.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.320
Cyber Bible.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.320
What's the cyber Bible for the digital age?

40:59.320 --> 41:01.320
Thou shalt not robo-freak.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.320
Don't robo-freak.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.320
What is robo-freaking?

41:05.320 --> 41:06.320
Just so I know for sure.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
So I'm clear?

41:07.320 --> 41:11.320
How about anything where you talk about having a surrogate baby inside of a robot body?

41:11.320 --> 41:12.320
That's a sin?

41:12.320 --> 41:13.320
I guess.

41:13.320 --> 41:17.320
I like to have that discussion and that the word sin enters into it.

41:17.320 --> 41:21.320
There are so many other things that is before it is a sin.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.320
Is it weird?

41:22.320 --> 41:23.320
Is it wrong?

41:23.320 --> 41:25.320
Is it imaginary?

41:25.320 --> 41:30.320
Is it not real in any way?

41:30.320 --> 41:31.320
Don't...

41:31.320 --> 41:32.320
Don't...

41:32.320 --> 41:34.320
Don't fuck this robot.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.320
This robot is...

41:35.320 --> 41:38.320
I know how it looks wearing lipstick sneaking around in your garden.

41:38.320 --> 41:41.320
Looks great.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.320
It's got mystery.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.320
It's got intrigue.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.320
Can it even feel things?

41:44.320 --> 41:45.320
Wait.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.320
Is it a sin?

41:46.320 --> 41:47.320
Is it a girl robot?

41:47.320 --> 41:48.320
Oh.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.320
You're saying...

41:49.320 --> 41:50.320
Wait.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.320
Wait a second, Rick Perry.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.320
Wait a minute.

41:52.320 --> 41:58.320
You're saying if he fucks a... if this is a lady that fucks a boy robot, then it's bad?

41:58.320 --> 42:00.320
Is that what you're saying?

42:00.320 --> 42:01.320
No.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.320
Okay.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.320
You just want...

42:04.320 --> 42:10.320
You just don't want a bunch of robo-sexuals running around undermining family values.

42:10.320 --> 42:14.320
Hey, by the way, first Republican presidential hopeful to adopt that platform?

42:14.320 --> 42:16.320
You've got my vote.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.320
I will...

42:17.320 --> 42:21.320
I will switch parties if you come out against robo-freaking.

42:21.320 --> 42:22.320
It is...

42:22.320 --> 42:23.320
Did you get one of those robo-calls?

42:23.320 --> 42:24.320
Yeah, I did.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.320
It was weird.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.320
It was about robo.

42:26.320 --> 42:27.320
It was a robo-sex call.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.320
It was a robo-sex call.

42:28.320 --> 42:33.320
It was really dirty and there was lots of bleeps and boops.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.320
Put it in my...

42:35.320 --> 42:42.320
Everyone knows that if it feels good, it's not a sin.

42:42.320 --> 42:47.320
Tell that to fuck poor Cyber Dave the robot who keeps getting fucked by a human.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.320
Like, he doesn't care how it feels.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.320
He's a robot.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.320
He doesn't even get to vote.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.320
Which, by the way, that is a sin.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.320
Yeah, it's criminal.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.320
It is a sin.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.320
They've got emotions.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.320
They can decide...

42:56.320 --> 42:57.320
Their logic circuits are better than ours.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.320
Are you saying it's a sin that robots don't get to vote?

42:59.320 --> 43:00.320
It is.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.320
Yeah, exactly.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.320
I don't think robots are advanced enough yet to vote.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.320
Like, I don't...

43:04.320 --> 43:05.320
Like, there are robots...

43:05.320 --> 43:06.320
Whoa!

43:06.320 --> 43:07.320
It's that kind of mentality, Griffin.

43:07.320 --> 43:08.320
There's a kind of...

43:08.320 --> 43:09.320
No, no, no, no, no.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.320
All right.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.320
You're gonna start spewing some anti-robo bullshit.

43:12.320 --> 43:13.320
This...

43:13.320 --> 43:17.320
My Roomba doesn't grasp the subtle intricacies of our government system.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.320
I don't want to think that exclusively...

43:19.320 --> 43:21.320
The Robos are coming here and taking our job.

43:21.320 --> 43:22.320
Yeah.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.320
This thing...

43:23.320 --> 43:24.320
Vacuuming our floors, making our cars.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.320
If that doesn't preclude many of the flyover states from voting,

43:27.320 --> 43:29.320
I don't see why it should preclude robots.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.320
Well, most of the people who live in flyover states

43:31.320 --> 43:36.320
don't exclusively eat the Cheetos that I drop on the floor.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.320
Or maybe they do.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.320
Are you talking about...

43:39.320 --> 43:42.320
I don't think Roombas will ever vote.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.320
Is that what you're saying to me?

43:43.320 --> 43:46.320
That's what you're saying.

43:46.320 --> 43:51.320
You just turned it back on me, how to kill a mockingbird style.

43:51.320 --> 43:54.320
There wasn't a lot of turnout for the 2012 election,

43:54.320 --> 43:58.320
but there was a huge turnout for the anti-dirty floors levy.

43:58.320 --> 44:01.320
I just called that book How to Kill a Mockingbird.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.320
I'm pretty sure it's not an instruction manual.

44:03.320 --> 44:06.320
Use rocks and guns and stuff.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.320
Catch them in a net and then hit them with something hard and heavy.

44:09.320 --> 44:11.320
How to murder a mockingbird.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.320
Just get them.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
They're really tiny and fragile.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.320
You can step on them.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.320
There's lots of ways.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.320
It's easy.

44:17.320 --> 44:18.320
What do angels eat?

44:18.320 --> 44:20.320
Mockingbirds.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.320
Feed them to an angel.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.320
Cook them.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.320
Throw fire at them.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.320
This is going to be great.

44:24.320 --> 44:25.320
What's his nickname?

44:25.320 --> 44:28.320
Mockingbird killer.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.320
You got Yahoo or a regular question?

44:30.320 --> 44:32.320
Oh, yeah.

44:32.320 --> 44:34.320
Where's Hesitant Houston?

44:34.320 --> 44:35.320
What?

44:35.320 --> 44:36.320
Hi.

44:36.320 --> 44:37.320
Hey.

44:37.320 --> 44:38.320
Oh, a shadowy figure.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.320
Arises for the night.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.320
Hesitant Houston says,

44:41.320 --> 44:43.320
I have a potential job opportunity in Salt Lake City,

44:43.320 --> 44:45.320
which is where my nuclear family lives.

44:45.320 --> 44:47.320
Whoa.

44:47.320 --> 44:50.320
However, all of my awesome friends

44:50.320 --> 44:52.320
and the whole rest of my life is in Houston.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.320
Should I leave it all behind to join the fam

44:54.320 --> 44:55.320
and advance the career,

44:55.320 --> 44:58.320
or should I stay with the friends I love

44:58.320 --> 44:59.320
and hope for the best?

44:59.320 --> 45:01.320
It's from Hesitant Houston.

45:01.320 --> 45:02.320
Listen.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.320
I don't care how awesome your friends are.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.320
If you have a nuclear family,

45:05.320 --> 45:07.320
they're not going to compete with that.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.320
I've seen ones you want to move there

45:09.320 --> 45:10.320
and focus on your half-life.

45:10.320 --> 45:17.320
Yeah.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.320
We...

45:19.320 --> 45:21.320
That's bad.

45:21.320 --> 45:25.320
I've seen the Incredibles.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.320
Yeah.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.320
Do they have, like,

45:27.320 --> 45:29.320
alien tendrils growing out of their body

45:29.320 --> 45:30.320
because of the waste?

45:30.320 --> 45:33.320
I want to know what your situation, like, here is

45:33.320 --> 45:37.320
that you have to define it as hope for the best.

45:37.320 --> 45:40.320
You know, I believe you should be with your family.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.320
Record a podcast with them,

45:41.320 --> 45:43.320
just hang out with them, whatever.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.320
I don't know anybody in Salt Lake City,

45:45.320 --> 45:47.320
but I'm pretty sure that's where they film Sister Wives.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.320
Is that true?

45:49.320 --> 45:50.320
It's around there.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.320
Can you get to know the Sister Wives people?

45:52.320 --> 45:54.320
Because if you get in that club,

45:54.320 --> 45:56.320
there's, like, 45 people in it

45:56.320 --> 45:58.320
for you to just know and have in your crew.

45:58.320 --> 46:01.320
Well, 45 people, 41 of which are kids.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.320
So if you want to be the guy

46:02.320 --> 46:04.320
who has a lot of little kid friends,

46:04.320 --> 46:05.320
which has worked out so well

46:05.320 --> 46:06.320
for many entertainers in the past,

46:06.320 --> 46:09.320
by all means, befriend the Sister Wives.

46:09.320 --> 46:13.320
Or you can be wife of a five.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.320
You can be the fifth wife in that unit,

46:15.320 --> 46:17.320
and then get all the perks of being

46:17.320 --> 46:19.320
in the Sister Wife unit.

46:19.320 --> 46:22.320
No, because he's a dude, and then it gets weird.

46:22.320 --> 46:23.320
Oh, yeah.

46:23.320 --> 46:27.320
You can be brother-husband.

46:27.320 --> 46:31.320
This is my brother-husband resident in Houston.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.320
I love him very much.

46:33.320 --> 46:35.320
I know nothing about Salt Lake City

46:35.320 --> 46:38.320
except that that might be where Sister Wives is filmed,

46:38.320 --> 46:41.320
and that might not even be true.

46:41.320 --> 46:43.320
Don't they have a sports team?

46:43.320 --> 46:44.320
Yeah, the Jazz.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.320
The Jazzers.

46:45.320 --> 46:48.320
The Jazzercizers.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.320
Pretty sure it's not the Jazzers.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.320
I say family beats friends any day of the week.

46:52.320 --> 46:53.320
Isn't that right, guys?

46:53.320 --> 46:54.320
In a fight.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.320
In a fight, you can get it together.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.320
Yeah.

46:57.320 --> 46:58.320
Unless your family sucks.

46:58.320 --> 46:59.320
Yeah.

46:59.320 --> 47:03.320
Are you moving there from Austin?

47:03.320 --> 47:05.320
Dude, that's in Houston.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.320
Whoa.

47:06.320 --> 47:07.320
You're right.

47:07.320 --> 47:08.320
Listen.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.320
Oh, snap.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.320
No, no, no.

47:10.320 --> 47:11.320
That was a good burn.

47:11.320 --> 47:15.320
In my defense, I've drank like half of a Tropical Chillers.

47:15.320 --> 47:16.320
I swear to...

47:16.320 --> 47:18.320
Now the onus is back on you.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.320
We should have handed that out.

47:20.320 --> 47:22.320
How many Tropical Chillers have you drank?

47:22.320 --> 47:23.320
Repost.

47:23.320 --> 47:25.320
Griffin, you got a Yahoo?

47:25.320 --> 47:27.320
I know someone who's not getting a picture with us later.

47:27.320 --> 47:28.320
Ooh.

47:28.320 --> 47:29.320
You absolutely...

47:29.320 --> 47:30.320
Pretty much everyone,

47:30.320 --> 47:32.320
because we'll be passed out in the dressing room.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.320
We're gonna black out on Tropical Chillers.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.320
Did you go to the My Brother, My Brother Me Show?

47:36.320 --> 47:37.320
Yeah, it's the last one.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.320
It was really funny.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.320
For the first 40 minutes,

47:39.320 --> 47:41.320
and then the Tropical Chillers caught up with him.

47:41.320 --> 47:42.320
Griffin, help me out.

47:42.320 --> 47:43.320
Oh, God.

47:43.320 --> 47:44.320
This one is sent in by Alethea Eckhart.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.320
Thank you, Alethea.

47:45.320 --> 47:48.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Julia, who asks,

47:48.320 --> 47:53.320
does anyone know where to find a gargoyle nativity set?

47:53.320 --> 47:56.320
I'm looking to find a nativity set in the form of gargoyles.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.320
Any suggestions are helpful.

47:57.320 --> 47:59.320
Thanks.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.320
Um, not any suggestions.

48:01.320 --> 48:02.320
I bet the ones that we're gonna have

48:02.320 --> 48:04.320
are not gonna be particularly useful.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.320
In my nightmares.

48:05.320 --> 48:08.320
Did...

48:08.320 --> 48:11.320
Are there other monsters that are getting their own nativity sets

48:11.320 --> 48:12.320
that I didn't know about?

48:12.320 --> 48:14.320
Does anyone know where to find a werewolf nativity set?

48:14.320 --> 48:15.320
Yeah.

48:15.320 --> 48:18.320
With, like, Baby Jesus halfway through Transformers.

48:18.320 --> 48:20.320
They didn't follow a star.

48:20.320 --> 48:23.320
They followed the full moon.

48:23.320 --> 48:26.320
We brought him frankincense and silver bullets.

48:26.320 --> 48:31.320
I... why do you need a gargoyle nativity set?

48:31.320 --> 48:33.320
You know, we don't take the time to ask the obvious questions

48:33.320 --> 48:35.320
and out here, my brother, my brother, me,

48:35.320 --> 48:37.320
what are you doing with this?

48:37.320 --> 48:39.320
So their gargoyle friends don't feel left out.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.320
Yeah.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.320
Yeah, right.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.320
Oh, wait.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.320
They're Jewish.

48:43.320 --> 48:44.320
Well, I guess they...

48:44.320 --> 48:45.320
What?

48:45.320 --> 48:46.320
They don't do that.

48:46.320 --> 48:48.320
They don't do the nativity thing, do they?

48:48.320 --> 48:50.320
No, and I don't think they think it starts...

48:50.320 --> 48:51.320
It starts off right there.

48:51.320 --> 48:53.320
Wait, were you thinking of the golem?

48:53.320 --> 48:54.320
That's what it was.

48:54.320 --> 48:55.320
Okay, good.

48:55.320 --> 48:56.320
I got it mixed around my head.

48:56.320 --> 48:57.320
We'll just edit this one out later.

48:57.320 --> 49:00.320
This is a director's cut goof for everybody here.

49:00.320 --> 49:04.320
Hey, let's say more things about Kwanzaa that we don't understand.

49:04.320 --> 49:08.320
I think anybody can appreciate the Kwanzaa cube gag.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.320
I've been working on that for ages.

49:10.320 --> 49:14.320
Can we help this person out and find monster themed nativity sets anywhere?

49:14.320 --> 49:15.320
This is my problem.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.320
To have a gargoyle themed nativity set, at some point,

49:17.320 --> 49:21.320
some stonemason or carver would have to sit there and go,

49:21.320 --> 49:23.320
I'm sick of all this human stuff.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.320
Yeah.

49:24.320 --> 49:25.320
I know what the people want.

49:25.320 --> 49:26.320
I need a Jesus.

49:26.320 --> 49:27.320
Gargoyle babies.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.320
I need a Jesus with wings and a beak.

49:29.320 --> 49:31.320
Also, he is made of stone.

49:31.320 --> 49:34.320
And he perches high upon a watchtower.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.320
I don't think Jesus wants to be in a watchtower.

49:36.320 --> 49:39.320
I think we've got to stick with the manger or else it's not really nativity.

49:39.320 --> 49:41.320
Keep perches on the edge of a manger.

49:41.320 --> 49:43.320
Yeah, because there's no room for him to perch.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.320
And then they're saying, get back in that manger, Jesus.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.320
Yeah, you're a baby.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.320
That's dangerous.

49:47.320 --> 49:50.320
Watch out for the gargoyle cow, Jesus.

49:50.320 --> 49:53.320
There were no perches left on the end, so we had to perch.

49:53.320 --> 50:03.320
The real lie that this set tells is that you can get gargoyles to sit still for anything.

50:03.320 --> 50:05.320
Because they, you know, you get a bunch of them in a room together,

50:05.320 --> 50:08.320
they're going to start arguing, they're going to start having a political fight,

50:08.320 --> 50:10.320
and it's going to be a real disaster.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.320
Yeah, humans, you can get them to stand around, even cows and sheep and stuff,

50:13.320 --> 50:14.320
but gargoyles, ugh.

50:14.320 --> 50:19.320
I have been trying to reference the TV show Gargoyles for a while.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.320
I've been trying to do it in a way that wasn't just saying,

50:21.320 --> 50:23.320
Gargoyles, the TV show.

50:23.320 --> 50:26.320
Hey, if you guys are at the cartoon, they have gargoyles in it.

50:26.320 --> 50:30.320
I almost said that one of the wise men would have to be voiced by Jonathan Frakes.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.320
Jesus.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.320
But I think that might be, like it's a real deep cut.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.320
So I'm really going out to the boneyard for this one.

50:36.320 --> 50:39.320
I would really love to see the look on your face as you look around the audience,

50:39.320 --> 50:42.320
like, guys, Jonathan Frakes, anyone?

50:42.320 --> 50:44.320
How about that Jonathan Frakes groove?

50:44.320 --> 50:48.320
As the stars at night are big and bright.

50:48.320 --> 50:50.320
Deep in the heart of Texas.

50:50.320 --> 50:52.320
Yeah, it gets you out of anything.

50:52.320 --> 50:54.320
That's our fucking zip line.

50:54.320 --> 50:55.320
Bad news, everybody.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.320
That's the ripcord.

50:56.320 --> 51:00.320
So after this, we are working without a net.

51:00.320 --> 51:01.320
You got anything else, Griffin?

51:01.320 --> 51:02.320
Do you have anything else to say?

51:02.320 --> 51:05.320
I do, but it's a question you hate and you don't want me to read.

51:05.320 --> 51:06.320
Oh, do it.

51:06.320 --> 51:07.320
Don't read this fucking question.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.320
Read it as loud as you can.

51:09.320 --> 51:10.320
It was sent by Lynn W.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.320
Wait, can we just end the show instead of that?

51:12.320 --> 51:15.320
That's by Yahoo Answers user Koopy Koo, who asked.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.320
I am against this.

51:16.320 --> 51:17.320
I'm not here for this part.

51:17.320 --> 51:18.320
For the next 30 seconds, Justin's going to check out.

51:18.320 --> 51:24.320
How do I tell my girlfriend that a thing down there looks weird?

51:24.320 --> 51:26.320
Like everyone else does.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.320
It was the first time I ever saw it on a woman and it looked weird.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.320
How do I tell her?

51:30.320 --> 51:33.320
Hold up.

51:33.320 --> 51:39.320
It was the first time you ever saw it on a woman?

51:39.320 --> 51:41.320
You've seen illustrations and stuff.

51:41.320 --> 51:44.320
I was looking through the tree line and I saw it.

51:44.320 --> 51:47.320
It inspired me like sunshine through the boughs.

51:47.320 --> 51:50.320
Yeah, the first time I heard dubstep, it was weird to me.

51:50.320 --> 51:53.320
You have to get used to these things.

51:53.320 --> 51:54.320
Yeah.

51:54.320 --> 51:58.320
Hey, have you ever seen Skrillex's vagina?

51:58.320 --> 52:00.320
It's like wicked weird looking.

52:00.320 --> 52:05.320
I feel that this is like a whole avenue that Hallmark could go down and just like a series

52:05.320 --> 52:08.320
of cards on the front that says, hey, baby, I love you so much.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.320
And there's like a beautiful sunrise.

52:09.320 --> 52:12.320
And then you open it and it just says, but your vagina is weird.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.320
Your business region is like, what?

52:14.320 --> 52:17.320
Your downtown area is like, what the fuck?

52:17.320 --> 52:20.320
You have to broach it with her scientifically.

52:20.320 --> 52:22.320
You have to say, hey, listen.

52:22.320 --> 52:23.320
And push your glasses up your nose.

52:23.320 --> 52:29.320
Push your glasses up your nose and say, listen, I need to see some of your friend's vaginas

52:29.320 --> 52:30.320
because right now I'm-

52:30.320 --> 52:33.320
I'm going to need you to do a side by side comparison.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.320
Yeah, I have no basis.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.320
This is purely scientific.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.320
You understand.

52:37.320 --> 52:41.320
Clinical, a clinical study of your friend Darlene's vagina.

52:41.320 --> 52:47.320
I want you to read that, just the first sentence of that answer.

52:47.320 --> 52:51.320
Rosie says, you're going to destroy her self-esteem if you tell her.

52:51.320 --> 52:54.320
So find a way to communicate that doesn't involve making her feel gross.

52:54.320 --> 53:00.320
If her entire self-esteem is based upon the beauty of her vagina, she doesn't have a lot-

53:00.320 --> 53:07.320
I don't have a lot of things going for me, but man, is my vagina great.

53:07.320 --> 53:10.320
I would like to formally apologize for thinking we shouldn't read this question

53:10.320 --> 53:14.320
because it's gone great so far.

53:14.320 --> 53:16.320
What a gem.

53:16.320 --> 53:19.320
One for the record books, I'd say.

53:19.320 --> 53:23.320
I'm pretty sure that nobody with vagina listens to our show.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.320
Oops.

53:24.320 --> 53:25.320
Oops.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.320
Sorry.

53:26.320 --> 53:27.320
Sorry.

53:27.320 --> 53:28.320
We should end this.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.320
Thank you guys.

53:29.320 --> 53:33.320
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first I should say thank you to all of you

53:33.320 --> 53:37.320
who have come to our show from Austin, the surrounding area in New Orleans.

53:37.320 --> 53:38.320
Thank you guys for coming.

53:38.320 --> 53:40.320
You're like the best people in the whole world.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.320
I love you very much.

53:41.320 --> 53:42.320
Thank you so much.

53:42.320 --> 53:45.320
Sorry about that stuff I said about nobody with vaginas listening to the show.

53:45.320 --> 53:47.320
I feel bad about today.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.320
There's a lot of people.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.320
It's just looking around the room.

53:49.320 --> 53:50.320
There's a lot of-

53:50.320 --> 53:51.320
I can't help but notice.

53:51.320 --> 53:55.320
There's like 30 to 40 vagina people with-

53:55.320 --> 53:57.320
And that is what they prefer, right?

53:57.320 --> 53:58.320
Yeah.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.320
That's the PC term.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.320
That's the PC term.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.320
Vagina among us.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.320
There's a lot of vaginids.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.320
The vaginids among you.

54:05.320 --> 54:12.320
The vaginies.

54:12.320 --> 54:15.320
I can't say that word anymore for the rest of my life.

54:15.320 --> 54:17.320
I burned them all this night.

54:17.320 --> 54:20.320
Thank you.

54:20.320 --> 54:23.320
If anybody wants to eat super fruit gummies, we got them up here.

54:23.320 --> 54:24.320
We got plenty of extras.

54:24.320 --> 54:25.320
Don't be shy.

54:25.320 --> 54:26.320
Don't eat more than two of the acais.

54:26.320 --> 54:27.320
Make sure you come by.

54:27.320 --> 54:28.320
You will freak out.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.320
We'll be over here.

54:29.320 --> 54:32.320
Come by and say hi and get a picture and get something signed and buy a poster if you want

54:32.320 --> 54:34.320
for 10 bucks.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.320
And we're going to be going-

54:35.320 --> 54:37.320
Where are we going to after we're done here?

54:37.320 --> 54:38.320
We're going to go to the Kung Fu Saloon.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.320
They have ski ball, so-

54:40.320 --> 54:41.320
Free ski ball.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.320
Free ski ball, so-

54:42.320 --> 54:43.320
Drink.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.320
Yeah, drink it in.

54:44.320 --> 54:45.320
Free ski ball.

54:45.320 --> 54:48.320
Were you guys just disappointed that the ski ball is free?

54:48.320 --> 54:51.320
That's how you know it's real low level ski ball.

54:51.320 --> 54:52.320
There's going to be kilometers on it.

54:52.320 --> 54:53.320
I saved my tokens.

54:53.320 --> 54:56.320
And special thanks to everyone who helped out with the show tonight.

54:56.320 --> 54:58.320
To Rachel, Sydney, Bristol.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.320
Thanks, guys.

54:59.320 --> 55:00.320
Justin.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.320
Tanner.

55:01.320 --> 55:02.320
Jordan.

55:02.320 --> 55:03.320
Jordan.

55:03.320 --> 55:04.320
And thank you to Blue Theater for having us.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.320
Yeah, thanks, Blue Theater.

55:05.320 --> 55:12.320
I want to thank the creators of Tropic Chillers with a Z.

55:12.320 --> 55:14.320
Don't tell them about all the mean things we said about them.

55:14.320 --> 55:16.320
Your shit tastes so bad.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.320
They probably don't have a lot going for them.

55:18.320 --> 55:21.320
Except for their beautiful vaginas.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.320
Griffin, go ahead with the last question.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.320
This final Yahoo is sent in by Nefariosity.

55:24.320 --> 55:25.320
Thank you, Nefariosity.

55:25.320 --> 55:29.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Zoro, who is a top contributor, who asks,

55:29.320 --> 55:36.320
Star Wars fans, can a Jedi use the Jedi mind trick to induce labor?

55:36.320 --> 55:37.320
I'm Justin McElroy.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.320
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.320
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

55:40.320 --> 55:41.320
Kiss your dad.

55:41.320 --> 56:08.320
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:08.320 --> 56:25.320
I'm Travis McElroy.
