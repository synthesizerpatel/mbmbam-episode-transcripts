00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.000
Hi everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:48.000 --> 00:51.920
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm the

00:51.920 --> 00:57.680
baby, baby, baby, girlfriend McElroy. We are, you have reached us here at Prank HQ. Uh-oh.

00:57.680 --> 01:02.480
Tomorrow is April Fool's Day, as you know, assuming you're listening to this on Monday,

01:02.480 --> 01:08.880
and we are prepping for the biggest prank of the year. Before we came in to start recording,

01:09.600 --> 01:15.920
when we were out in the lobby, before we came into the studio, Griffin told me he had the best,

01:15.920 --> 01:23.520
the biggest idea for a prank to pull on anybody ever in the history of prankdom. He said it was

01:23.520 --> 01:30.080
going to make us the mayors of prankton, is what he said. And I said, wait, hold that thought. Don't

01:30.080 --> 01:37.040
tell me the prank plan now. We're in the lobby. Wait till we're in front of the MICs. So Griffin,

01:37.040 --> 01:45.440
now that we have retired to the recording studio, we are in front of the mics, the show's started.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.240
We're laying on our chaise lounges.

01:48.240 --> 01:55.520
We're, lay it out for me Griffin, prank of all time. Just to let everyone know,

01:55.520 --> 02:01.840
to reiterate that I definitely came up with ahead of time. And then I like informed Justin to set

02:01.840 --> 02:07.200
up this intro so that I would just come out and say what the prank was that I invented ahead of

02:07.200 --> 02:12.800
time before we started recording. I feel like I've contextualized, read stalled. You may be

02:12.800 --> 02:15.600
listening to this thinking like, is this like one of those things where Justin's just saying this?

02:15.600 --> 02:20.640
And that didn't really happen. And it's just like a fun way to see how Griffin reacts in

02:20.640 --> 02:24.240
a situation where like, he is the lobster. He's just been thrown into the boiling water.

02:25.280 --> 02:31.600
Can he escape from the trap or is this not a trap at all? Did he mean to get his, his goose cooked?

02:31.600 --> 02:36.400
Mixing my animal cooking metaphors, but that's quite all right. Griffin, I'm ready

02:36.400 --> 02:41.440
for the prank of all time. I mean, I guess there's a lot of stuff that you need to understand before

02:41.440 --> 02:50.240
I can reveal the prank. Like my prank draws on a lot of different influences. Are you familiar

02:50.240 --> 02:57.280
with the jerky boys? I am. I love their work. Not those jerky boys. I'm talking about the,

02:57.280 --> 03:06.240
the hoodlums who hang out outside of my local Sit Go and they shoplift and eat beef jerky and

03:06.240 --> 03:13.040
just like the stoop. The jerky, but the ones whose mouths always smelled like smoky teriyaki.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.640
I think it's supposed to be teriyaki, but for some reason when it's smoky,

03:20.640 --> 03:29.840
they call it smoky teriyaki. So that's important. So you need to know the jerky boys. Got it.

03:29.840 --> 03:36.400
How much Franz Kafka have you read? I mean, just like anybody else, I understand when people reference

03:36.400 --> 03:41.520
metamorphosis, but I have not actually read any of his work. Yeah, no, he did write a book about a

03:41.520 --> 03:49.280
bug. I say this because my prank involves a giant bug that used to be a man. So that's going to be

03:49.280 --> 03:54.720
tricky. I'm not going to lie to you. There's a lot of, uh, I would say impossible setup for this prank

03:54.720 --> 03:59.120
that is going to render it literally impossible to, to achieve. But if man, if we can do it.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.440
Okay. Now I have a question. What about Damon? Are we going to get Matt Damon on board? Is Damon

04:03.440 --> 04:10.880
like in for this? What about Damon Waymans? Hi everybody. He's a smoky teriyaki. What about

04:10.880 --> 04:19.120
Damon Waymans, smoky teriyaki king of the Midwest? Um, there are three Wayans involved.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.720
Three Wayans involved. Can you guess which ones? You can't because one of them is Hank Wayans.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.760
Not a lot of people know about him. Hank Wayans the third or Hank Wayans junior?

04:31.760 --> 04:39.920
Hank Wayans, um, not a, uh, he is not a famous actor, but boy, can he fucking pull a prank with

04:39.920 --> 04:45.840
the best of them. Um, who's the prank on? Who are we pranking with this prank? Well, this is the

04:45.840 --> 04:51.680
thing. It's sort of, uh, um, it's sort of like a choose your own adventure. Like it's just an empty

04:51.680 --> 04:58.160
slate that you can fill with, you know, whoever you want to use it on. You know what I mean? It's

04:58.160 --> 05:01.840
not like I'm going to prank like the president. And I mean, that would be a pretty good one.

05:01.840 --> 05:07.520
Don't know how I'm going to get the bug into the white house, but the, the sorry, the bug that was

05:07.520 --> 05:12.720
a human that was transformed by magic. Can you have the jerky boys poses caterers and maybe,

05:12.720 --> 05:18.000
Oh, I mean, that would be easy. Cause that's their, that's their job. You think their fucking job is

05:18.000 --> 05:22.080
just hanging out outside the gas station? You think that's how they make their living? No,

05:22.080 --> 05:25.680
they're white house caterers. They're white house. So they're going to, they're going to,

05:25.680 --> 05:33.120
they're going to sneak Maiman Waymans into the white house and some sort of like rolling cart

05:33.120 --> 05:37.840
because he's small and also an acrobat. He's very, very, very little. And then they robbed

05:37.840 --> 05:43.680
the casino, but at the same times they show that the casino owner doesn't really love his wife.

05:43.680 --> 05:50.320
So that Maiman Waymans can get back with the wife. That's going to happen. That's not really like

05:50.320 --> 05:54.560
the point of the prank. It's not really funny, but like the great thing about this prank is that

05:54.560 --> 05:59.920
it's going to change and improve the lives of everybody involved with it. Not a joke per se.

05:59.920 --> 06:05.760
There's not a punch. There is a, but there is a, but of the joke and it's our American president

06:05.760 --> 06:10.240
in this specific example. But everybody else who's involved with it is going to get a little

06:10.240 --> 06:16.320
something on the side. Well, Griffin, I, I'm so excited about this prank. I can't wait to,

06:16.320 --> 06:24.320
to stunt it and, uh, pull it off, uh, with the whole crew, the jerky boys, Maiman Wayman,

06:24.320 --> 06:30.160
Daymans, Smoky Teriyoki, the whole gang. I'm so glad they're all going to get together for one

06:30.160 --> 06:34.960
last big heist. Yep. And, uh, I'm glad that I was able to sort of outline exactly what the prank

06:34.960 --> 06:41.120
was. Yep. Well, thank you for coming up with it ahead of time. Um, it is to just,

06:41.120 --> 06:48.480
we're going to steal all the toilets. So Obama's, Obama's going to be running around. Hey,

06:48.480 --> 06:52.560
I thought I had a toilet in here. Great, great, great, great, great, great impression.

06:54.160 --> 07:01.360
Hey Joe, did you, did you steal the toilets, Joe? That Joe Biden? No Biden? No, I didn't.

07:01.360 --> 07:08.480
I'd left them wherever I used them. Is he Charles Nelson Riley? He's Joe Biden. Okay.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.200
Are you sure he's not the lead singer of the B-52s?

07:16.560 --> 07:21.840
Super pussy. Okay. Nobody's going to get super pussy. That's like the deepest inside joke,

07:21.840 --> 07:29.200
basically ever. That was a fake B-52 song that Griffin came up with. I don't think it's that

07:29.200 --> 07:34.400
hard to explain. Six years ago. Like 150 years ago. Super pussy. Can you do it once, Griffin?

07:36.560 --> 07:41.120
Hey there, brothers. My boyfriend is in a band that's starting to get really big.

07:41.920 --> 07:47.120
I go to one of his shows every weekend, pretty much. My issue, I'm assuming it's the B-52s,

07:47.120 --> 07:52.080
my issue is that I don't know how to act when I watch him on stage. I feel awkward being right

07:52.080 --> 07:56.720
up front staring at him, but I want him to notice me in the crowd. I'm five feet tall,

07:56.720 --> 08:04.160
so I get lost in the crowd pretty easily. Do you have any ideas for how I can be a good,

08:04.160 --> 08:08.480
supportive band girlfriend and not come off as awkward or just standing there?

08:09.120 --> 08:14.960
And that's from Phelan Oxoss in Chicago. I have a question for you guys about this.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.880
Is there a way to ask the boyfriend if he actually cares whether she's there or not

08:24.880 --> 08:30.480
without it sounding like she's asking him to release her from going?

08:30.480 --> 08:38.160
That's what I'm saying. When I played Templeton the rat in our community three production of

08:38.160 --> 08:45.840
Charlotte's Web, which critics hailed that performance as revolutionary to pretending

08:45.840 --> 08:53.920
to be a rat, I wanted our meme meme to be there once, but I would feel guilty if she had to sit

08:53.920 --> 09:00.640
through the same shit. And it was not good outside of my revolutionary rap performance. It was not a

09:00.640 --> 09:08.240
great show. I don't want her. I start to feel guilty if Momo is out in the audience 14 all 14

09:08.240 --> 09:14.160
showings. But then the problem being that as soon as the person says, Hey, do you really care if I'm

09:14.160 --> 09:19.120
there or not? All I'm afraid all it's going to sound like is, Hey, I don't want to come see your

09:19.120 --> 09:25.680
show. You can only enjoy their ironic cover of tiny dancer so many times before it starts to

09:25.680 --> 09:30.400
grow a little stale and perhaps the effect is lost on you. Are you putting this person on

09:30.400 --> 09:36.160
blast because they're not very tall? No, I actually, that was not intentional. That would be the work

09:36.160 --> 09:42.640
of a much swifter man than myself. Ooh, I have a great idea. Uh huh. Convince your boyfriend and

09:42.640 --> 09:48.320
their band to start selling some merch and then you work the table. So you're there as a supportive

09:48.320 --> 09:53.920
girlfriend. You don't have to stand up in the front. But then do you get like a cut? Cause then

09:53.920 --> 09:58.800
your boyfriend does, but your boyfriend does. Oh, okay. Oh, that's some dog shit then. Hey babe,

09:58.800 --> 10:03.520
babe, babe, babe, babe. I'm going to be up on stage shredding. Um, and then I'm going to be

10:03.520 --> 10:08.000
backstage shredding too if you know what I mean. But Hey, well I'm back there. Babe, can you do me

10:08.000 --> 10:14.080
one flavor? Babe, can you do me one flavor? Just go do this unpaid job for me and I'll get all the

10:14.080 --> 10:21.200
profits. I bet you could ask for a cut. Yeah, I don't think you need to ask for a cut. I think

10:21.200 --> 10:27.920
between standing there staring at your boyfriend as he sings versus like doing an activity. Yeah.

10:27.920 --> 10:32.480
That you know what you're doing and is like. Get some fucking devil sticks if you want to like

10:32.480 --> 10:39.600
occupy your time. Like don't, don't make this poor, this poor woman like start shoveling coal.

10:39.600 --> 10:45.360
Hey, why are you shitting on my awesome idea? Travis had a great idea of this man or woman.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.840
I'm assuming woman only because five feet tall, but it could be a man,

10:49.840 --> 10:53.680
it could be a diminutive gentleman. And because she says supportive girlfriend, but that's fine.

10:56.560 --> 11:01.280
No, but Travis has a great idea. What? Okay. Let me, let me take Travis's idea

11:01.840 --> 11:07.520
and push it one step further. Uh, why don't you do join the band?

11:07.520 --> 11:13.600
No, well, okay. So I was going to say sort of join the band, but you don't know, uh,

11:13.600 --> 11:19.920
how to play any instruments. So what do you do? You, uh, you become the dancing

11:19.920 --> 11:25.440
guy in the My Name is Boss tones. Like that kind of vibe. You become like the hype man.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.760
You become like, uh, what's that cat's name? Ben? Something like that. You become like,

11:29.760 --> 11:36.240
no, like the guy who's there dancing. Like the guy who wears the nice suit and has an umbrella

11:36.240 --> 11:42.000
always during outcast performances. Yes. What was his name? Oh, I used to know his name too.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Rufus Wainwright, I think it was. I don't think that was who that was. I think it was Rufus

11:46.000 --> 11:53.840
Wainwright. I don't think that's who that was. I'm pretty sure it wasn't that. Fonzworth Bentley,

11:53.840 --> 11:59.360
Fonzworth Bentley, Fonzworth Bentley. I was so close. You weren't close fucking at all. You got

11:59.360 --> 12:05.760
0% of his name right. There was some similar letters. Okay, sure. So be like the Fonz or like

12:05.760 --> 12:10.880
Ben the guy from Mighty Mighty Boss tones and just dance on stage. Just get up on stage. Now

12:10.880 --> 12:15.840
you don't have to dance good. In fact, it would be better if you didn't. Um, if you,

12:15.840 --> 12:21.280
if you know how to skank it, that particular dance craze. Um, I don't know if your boyfriend

12:21.280 --> 12:28.880
is in a ska band, but that's always a popular maneuver. Yeah. Uh, I, I think that getting

12:28.880 --> 12:34.160
involved in some more concrete way, whether it be dancing or merge sales, uh, and nothing,

12:34.160 --> 12:38.240
but those two things, uh, I think that that's going to help you pass the time, make you feel

12:38.240 --> 12:42.720
a bit more purposeful, purpose-driven life. But there's like eight seasons of How I Met Your

12:42.720 --> 12:47.920
Mother on Netflix that this, that this woman needs to watch. Uh-huh. But that's why I love,

12:47.920 --> 12:51.120
that's why I love you sit at the merge table. You're not going to have to do anything till

12:51.120 --> 12:55.680
after the band plays. You could be on Netflix on your phone, but you can't hear all the funny,

12:55.680 --> 13:00.640
you can't hear all the funny jokes from Marshall and Lily and the crew. You put on headphones

13:00.640 --> 13:05.840
over all the loud, loud ska music that's going on on stage. The great thing about working is that

13:05.840 --> 13:13.120
when you want to not be at the concert, you have a great excuse. It's a lot harder to sell to say,

13:13.120 --> 13:19.120
I'm too tired to go listen to your band play than I'm too tired to go work the merge table.

13:19.120 --> 13:25.520
So if you, if you solidify that that's what you do with the shows, then it is a lot more

13:25.520 --> 13:28.720
excusable if you need to get out of it once in a while, because now you've turned it into a job.

13:28.720 --> 13:34.240
It already sounds like a job either way. I listen to you. I have no comment on your guys

13:34.800 --> 13:38.880
relationship or whatever, but like having to go to the same concert, like no matter how,

13:39.680 --> 13:43.920
like how incredible it may be every single time, like every weekend though.

13:44.800 --> 13:52.960
Hey babe, babe, babe, did you hear when I went? Yeah, like I heard it today and I heard it on the

13:52.960 --> 13:59.040
28th and then I heard it on the 21st. Babe, babe, it's different. I went na na na na instead of na

13:59.040 --> 14:04.400
na na na. Yeah, no, that was really, um, that was really good and it did take the song in like a

14:04.400 --> 14:09.600
totally different direction, but I am just going to kick it at home today, um, because they just

14:09.600 --> 14:15.360
added the first captain America movie to Netflix. But this, but tonight I was gonna go na na na na

14:15.360 --> 14:23.760
here and change the title of the song. No, just my, my, just my didgeridoo part. This is a pretty

14:23.760 --> 14:29.600
crazy band. What is this? Is this that? It's Rust and Root. Oh, they're back. I heard that they're

14:29.600 --> 14:34.880
back in a big, big way, but they're back. This is, but this is like, this is the new Rust and

14:34.880 --> 14:39.360
Root, like the new monkeys. A bunch of people got together and decided to be Rust and Root again.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.000
Yeah, no, it's sort of like Doctor Who. It's just a mantle that's passed from band to band.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.960
Why does fucking well be? That's what, that's why they say send me on my way. It's like,

14:49.520 --> 14:54.080
you've had fun with this band name for a while, but it's time to let it go and let somebody else

14:54.080 --> 15:00.720
have a chance to be Rust and Root. Goetje actually used to be Rust and Root. Wow. And then they,

15:00.720 --> 15:06.080
then they sent it on its way. Griffin, may we have a Yahoo answer question, please? Yeah, sure. This

15:06.080 --> 15:10.080
Yahoo was sent in by David DeCruz. Thank you, David. It's by Yahoo answers user. How can I

15:10.080 --> 15:15.120
include? Oh, no, I fucked up. Cause they changed how the shit works. Nobody saved. Nobody y'all.

15:15.760 --> 15:20.400
Thank you. Uh, thank you, David. It's by Yahoo answers user ghost gate who asks

15:22.400 --> 15:29.680
how can I include my Guinea pig more in my daily life? Please help. Okay. So I have a male G pig

15:29.680 --> 15:35.520
and I want to include him in my daily life. Okay. So from Monday to Friday, from like 7am to 4pm,

15:35.520 --> 15:41.600
I'm at school. I let him walk in my room. Whoa. I let him walk in my room, but I want to have

15:41.600 --> 15:47.680
him in all my daily stuff, such as when I go out or just pretty much in everything that's possible.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.440
But I have a problem. It's a dumb problem, but it's affecting me. Problem is that I can't afford

15:51.440 --> 15:58.240
to wash every day. I'm kind of broke. And so I can't change cloth every time he loses hair on me.

15:58.240 --> 16:03.840
I know it's pretty stupid, but that's my situation. So do you recommend buying a G pig carrier or what

16:03.840 --> 16:11.120
do I do? He doesn't have a buddy. Oh my God. This question. He also doesn't have a buddy. I know

16:11.680 --> 16:19.120
they supposed to be in pairs and all, but I know my story and can't really afford another G pig.

16:19.120 --> 16:24.400
So that's why I want him in my life more. And not just cause of that, but also cause I want like a

16:24.400 --> 16:30.080
closer friend. No, I'm not a loner, but more of a close pet cause I enjoy pet interaction. So

16:30.080 --> 16:36.160
please, please help me out and give me ideas with my weird problem. Please. Thank you. Signed Bill

16:36.160 --> 16:42.640
Gates. Signed Bill Gates, inventor of the computer. Griffin at this point, can you edit in the sound

16:42.640 --> 16:47.840
of me running down a long highway and jumping through a stained glass window? Because that's

16:47.840 --> 16:52.720
what I emotionally, that's where I'm at right now. You didn't have to read it, man. That was like,

16:52.720 --> 17:00.240
I felt like I was doing a Slylock Fox there. This gentleman, this gentleman can't afford to wash,

17:00.240 --> 17:08.160
but can't afford to feed a G pig. How are your priorities? I think he can afford to wash his

17:08.160 --> 17:14.400
body, but I don't think he can afford to like go to the laundromat every day because his stupid

17:14.400 --> 17:24.320
fucking filthy pig rat got his stupid filthy hair all over his jeans and his shirts. Maybe like

17:24.320 --> 17:30.560
invest in a lint roller. Maybe that would be a way that you could, or shower with your clothes on.

17:30.560 --> 17:35.520
Or just put the G pig in like a Ziploc bag before you put it in your pocket.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.560
That's a great idea, Trav. What's a G pig carrier?

17:38.560 --> 17:44.080
I imagine it's a Ziploc bag. It's a lunchbox pretty much, right?

17:45.280 --> 17:49.600
What's the point at that point? If you can't like, this is what I'm saying. How do you affix

17:50.960 --> 17:56.240
this G pig to yourself in a manner that still makes it feel like you have an animal attached

17:56.240 --> 18:04.800
to you? You know, back in the day, back in like French Revolution times, ladies would make their

18:04.800 --> 18:14.880
hair into like a cage and keep live birds in it until the bird died. Maybe that. Maybe you make

18:14.880 --> 18:20.400
like a G pig cage out of your hair and then the G pig rides on top of your head. Why would they

18:21.280 --> 18:26.400
wait for the bird to die? Because they didn't care about it as a pet. It was just as a decoration.

18:26.400 --> 18:31.040
Because they didn't know how to get it out. Well, that was also important. Guys, we fucked up again.

18:31.040 --> 18:37.520
Oh, man. Listen, you did a great job with my hair, but how did you get the bird out? Ah,

18:37.520 --> 18:42.720
fuck. I did it again. How didn't you notice there's a bird in my hair?

18:43.360 --> 18:49.040
No, I put the bird in. I put the bird in there, but when I was constructing the framing

18:49.760 --> 18:54.880
for your hair, I forgot the door part again. You left a bird in my hair. You know what's

18:54.880 --> 18:59.600
going to happen. Somebody will take a picture of it. It's going to be in a history book.

18:59.600 --> 19:03.680
People are going to think this is how we did it. Man, those people were dicks to their birds.

19:03.680 --> 19:10.080
See, that's what they're going to say. I didn't want to burn my hair. I hate this. I hate this

19:10.080 --> 19:17.440
haircut. Oh, God damn it. I love living in France though. I love France. I love France. God damn,

19:17.440 --> 19:27.760
our bread's so good. Hey, y'all, hope we don't get beheaded. Oh, boy. You know who I'm into,

19:27.760 --> 19:36.400
Napoleon. I wish someone had invented a moon pile already. Oh, shucks. Oh, hooks.

19:42.960 --> 19:48.960
Oh, man. I'm so sunburnt right now. I've got sun delirium, and I'm hoping that it's going to

19:48.960 --> 19:58.960
like let me tap in. I know what you're saying. Iron Man style. Get this. Can you embed the

19:58.960 --> 20:06.400
guinea pig in your chest? And running on a wheel somehow that powers you? Oh, I love that. That

20:06.400 --> 20:13.760
would be like a fun parody. What do you think? We could do like a fun parody, like one of those

20:13.760 --> 20:19.040
those fucking hilarious scary movies, like those parodies that can be like superheroes,

20:19.040 --> 20:26.640
and that could be like how we do Iron Man. The thing that bothers me most about this question

20:26.640 --> 20:31.920
is the idea that this person lists their guinea pig have free reign over their room.

20:31.920 --> 20:38.400
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy. That's crazy on many levels. One, what's it doing? Two,

20:38.400 --> 20:43.920
two, can you think of anything less appealing when you finish a long day at work knowing you

20:43.920 --> 20:49.680
have to go home and go on a G-Pig hunt? Is it in the laundry basket? Is it in the closet? Where is

20:49.680 --> 20:55.280
it? It's small. It's hiding. Where didn't it poop? Where didn't it poop? I had a buddy in college who

20:55.280 --> 21:00.560
had a hedgehog, which is like awesome. Like across the board, that's awesome. But he let it just roam

21:00.560 --> 21:06.560
free in his house, in his whole house. And then like I would go over there, and every time I went

21:06.560 --> 21:11.440
over there to hang out, it would be like instant dread. Like I'm going to step on this little thing

21:11.440 --> 21:16.880
and it's gonna hurt me and kill him. I'm gonna sit on the wrong pillow. I'm gonna sit on the

21:16.880 --> 21:20.800
wrong pillow and this hedgehog's gonna be fucking underneath it. And it's gonna be a fun prank,

21:21.840 --> 21:26.560
but not fun, I guess, by any conceivable metric, because I will kill the animal.

21:26.560 --> 21:31.760
I bought a moped in high school not knowing the social consequences that came with it.

21:31.760 --> 21:37.840
Now that college is upon me, do I bring it to school or keep it at home and be forced to walk

21:38.480 --> 21:44.400
around campus like the rest of my scholars? P.S. I bought the moped secondhand, and the previous

21:44.400 --> 21:50.080
owner put a super loud exhaust on it to make it go fast. This subsequently makes me look like a

21:50.080 --> 21:56.480
huge tool. That's from Easily Confused in New Hampshire. Efficiently, actually, which is weird

21:56.480 --> 22:06.160
that you mess that up. I am so glad that they, this is textbook good question submission to

22:06.160 --> 22:09.520
my brother and my brother and me, because if it had just been the first part, I would have been

22:09.520 --> 22:12.880
like, I don't get the big deal. I think mopeds are pretty great. If I had one here in Austin,

22:12.880 --> 22:17.040
I would use it to go everywhere. But the idea of having a super loud exhaust on it

22:17.040 --> 22:22.240
takes this thing and turns it right on its head because the whole thing about a moped is that

22:22.240 --> 22:26.960
you're supposed to be very, it's like a very discreet means of transport. It's a very ashamed,

22:26.960 --> 22:30.880
it's an ashamed means. You don't have to feel shameful about it, but it's not like

22:30.880 --> 22:38.400
something you want to be like, ah, moped, check me out. And if you put like a super banging exhaust

22:38.400 --> 22:45.360
on it, like that's exactly what you do. It's like you put like 20 inch rims on your razor scooter,

22:45.360 --> 22:49.920
like you stop it. You don't think about it. Sometimes when people own ostentatious things,

22:49.920 --> 22:53.280
you tend to make assumptions about them. You don't think about the fact that they might've

22:53.280 --> 22:56.400
just gotten stuck with it by happenstance. You know, it really makes you think, you know,

22:56.400 --> 23:00.800
right? Like when I, when I inherited water, you know, when I inherited your Oldsmobile Cutlass

23:00.800 --> 23:05.360
Sierra, right? Like I didn't have any choice in the matter. It was just the most balling car

23:05.360 --> 23:10.960
in Huntington, Virginia at the time. And so like, I would drive around like bumping those speaker

23:10.960 --> 23:16.560
rattling tunes that had broken off inside the car's cassette player. Um, and then people would

23:16.560 --> 23:22.160
be like, man, what a jerk that guy must be with all of his money. I'd be like, sorry, sorry guys,

23:22.160 --> 23:26.720
it's not me. It's my brother. He's the one who tricked us out. Sorry, player haters. Sorry,

23:26.720 --> 23:31.120
player haters. I know the hood ornaments gone. That's what my brother did. And like,

23:31.120 --> 23:38.320
I know it's a sick look, but it wasn't me. When the option is walking, the alternative has to be

23:38.320 --> 23:45.520
better. So you just have to make peace with the fact that you're the guy with the loud electric

23:45.520 --> 23:53.520
bicycle. Is that what a moped is? It's basically an electronic bicycle. I actually completely

23:53.520 --> 23:59.040
agree with Justin on this one. Do you, Travis? I do. See that's two out of three. That's a majority.

23:59.040 --> 24:06.400
So complete is your guy's hatred of, of, of ambulation. You would rather be like piggybacked.

24:06.400 --> 24:11.440
My life, Griffin, my day to day life is trying to figure out how to make the least amount of trips

24:11.440 --> 24:16.400
to and from someplace. If it means loading up my arms in a painful manner, just so I do not have

24:16.400 --> 24:22.560
to walk back to somewhere to get more things and go back, I will do it because walking is so awful.

24:23.600 --> 24:28.480
Why is it? It's like what we did for a billion years.

24:28.480 --> 24:33.360
Yes. And animals see us walking and they're like, ah, we're equals. We're not equals.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.120
You stupid idiots. And then the, you know, they hop on their mopeds.

24:37.120 --> 24:41.920
They're all squirrel mopeds. Can you imagine? Can you imagine?

24:41.920 --> 24:44.480
They're sitting on a Stewart Little.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.200
Oh God.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.760
I love them so much.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.040
I love them when I squeeze them and squeeze them. Oh, I killed them again.

24:51.920 --> 24:57.760
Listen, I don't think mopeds have, have a, I think you are imagining a moped stigma.

24:58.320 --> 25:03.280
Do you guys, let me ask you two. Do you have especially harsh feelings about mopeds?

25:03.280 --> 25:03.520
No.

25:03.520 --> 25:08.640
Uh, jealousy, I guess. Cause like usually if I see one I'm walking.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.560
Cause otherwise I'm not going to notice. I'm just going to assume it's like a tiny motorcycle.

25:12.560 --> 25:19.920
If you saw a man going on one of those giant bikes with the one huge wheel and one really

25:19.920 --> 25:24.640
small wheel, you would see that and be like, fuck that dude's cool cause he's not walking.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.240
And I am like a chump.

25:26.240 --> 25:31.360
Yup. It doesn't matter what it is. If I see a guy on a dead horse,

25:31.360 --> 25:35.040
I'm going to think the same thing. Man, man, he's not moving especially fast.

25:35.040 --> 25:38.880
If I see a guy rolling down a hill in a barrel, I'm like, nice.

25:38.880 --> 25:44.640
You know, I brought, uh, Jeremy Larson bought a moped, a scooter when we were living in

25:44.640 --> 25:50.400
Cincinnati together. And I was jealous on it both because it was better than walking

25:50.400 --> 25:52.400
and more fuel efficient than driving.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.720
It's a super good way to get around.

25:54.720 --> 25:59.600
Yeah. It's good. If anybody gives you shit, just say like uses less gas than your car.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.240
Yeah. Fucking asshole.

26:02.240 --> 26:07.040
But that, whoa, that's the thing. When you're riding on this super loud moped,

26:07.040 --> 26:12.000
you need to just be yelling shit constantly. Like, sorry, it's so loud.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.880
It's solar powered. It runs on the sun.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.680
Sun power is loud. What can you do?

26:17.680 --> 26:22.000
What can you do about it? That's not the motor. That's just my farts.

26:22.000 --> 26:28.400
I don't know why that would help. I don't know why that would help anything,

26:31.120 --> 26:34.160
but you should do it anyway. Let me know how it goes.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.520
Just don't walk. Please think about this.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.960
Think of the children.

26:38.960 --> 26:44.320
Think of the children. You have to walk. Dear brothers, I am six months pregnant.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.040
Congratulations.

26:45.680 --> 26:49.280
Thank you. So many people in my life, whether they have kids or not,

26:49.280 --> 26:54.240
keep giving me advice and I hate it. How can I politely or not so politely

26:54.240 --> 26:58.320
tell them I don't want their opinion? That's from preggers on the Pacific coast.

26:58.320 --> 27:01.600
You just gently rub your stomach and say, I'm ignoring you for two.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.160
I just asked my wife. I don't know. She should be the one.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.200
This should be my brother and my brother and Sydney and me.

27:11.200 --> 27:16.640
Yeah. I'm sure she's getting like, you got to rub oatmeal on your tummy and your underarms.

27:16.640 --> 27:20.240
Like she let me just get her real quick and then she could just feel this one for me.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.480
She can pinch hit. Sure. Yeah.

27:22.480 --> 27:26.560
Okay. Hold on one second. Hi. How are you guys?

27:28.720 --> 27:33.680
How are you? How's the baby so far? So good. I can feel her kicking a lot more now.

27:33.680 --> 27:37.680
That's weird. I said, is it rude if I ask if you're showing, I forget where you are.

27:37.680 --> 27:42.160
Oh no, I am. I'm I'm over five months now. So yeah.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.880
Have people started to awkwardly touching your stomach without permission?

27:44.880 --> 27:49.360
All the time. Awesome. It's terrible. Totally great.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.280
So this person is saying they're six months pregnant. So a bit more pregnant than you.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.480
Not that it's a competition. Not that it's a competition

27:56.480 --> 27:58.240
with this person's winning. Maybe pick up the pace.

27:59.360 --> 28:03.840
Try to rush her along. They keep getting advice. Well, we don't know if it's a he or she.

28:05.120 --> 28:12.240
They keep getting advice and they, that was a joke and they hate getting the advice from people

28:12.240 --> 28:17.360
and they want to know how they can politely turn it down. How much of this are you,

28:17.360 --> 28:19.600
how much of this shit do you have to eat every day?

28:21.760 --> 28:24.560
A lot, which is surprising because you'd think that like,

28:25.520 --> 28:28.240
it'd be limited somewhat by the fact that I'm a doctor.

28:28.240 --> 28:33.840
Right. That's the thing. Right. Like you are at a place I think where babies happen a lot

28:33.840 --> 28:35.520
all the time. Yeah.

28:35.520 --> 28:40.000
There are a lot of babies happening. And so like, I would assume that there's like a lot of people

28:40.000 --> 28:46.080
like, let me tell you what I did. But like you, you, you went to school for like a hundred years.

28:46.080 --> 28:51.840
You know, everything about every physiological issue ever. How can somebody have the hubris

28:51.840 --> 28:56.640
to be like, let me tell you one thing you didn't know about babies. Don't shake them shits.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.920
Like I super know that.

28:58.720 --> 29:03.280
Well, it's, I think it's one of those things where every woman thinks and maybe I should

29:03.280 --> 29:07.760
say rightfully so once they've been through it, once they've been through the whole, you know,

29:07.760 --> 29:13.600
40 weeks of pregnancy and then the labor process that they have earned the right to tell everybody

29:13.600 --> 29:17.360
else how to do it. And I think it's well-intentioned. I mean, most that's,

29:17.360 --> 29:20.000
most of the advice I get is from women who are pregnant.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
Nobody maliciously is like, uh, just, uh, do it in a toilet.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.720
I think, I think they really think like, oh, this will really help her out. This will really,

29:30.720 --> 29:35.920
she, I bet she doesn't know that she's going to get nauseous. I'll tell her about it.

29:35.920 --> 29:39.120
Have you ever had a point with someone like giving you advice where you've wanted to say like,

29:39.120 --> 29:42.480
Hey, just shut up. I don't get out of my, I don't care.

29:43.600 --> 29:49.280
Yeah. I, you know, what was funny is, uh, I have all these books that, uh, like about pregnancy

29:49.280 --> 29:54.560
updates, like fun stuff for each week and thing. And they, one of them says specifically, like how

29:54.560 --> 29:58.960
to deal with people giving you advice. And it tells you to just be polite, which is what I try

29:58.960 --> 30:04.720
really hard to do is just say, Oh, thanks. And nod and smile and walk away. Um, but it's really hard

30:04.720 --> 30:10.560
at, cause a lot of the time I'll just snap back. Yeah, I know. I know I basically know everything.

30:10.560 --> 30:16.480
Got it, chief. Thanks. I catch myself doing this a lot, uh, or I have, and I'm trying to curb it,

30:16.480 --> 30:21.120
um, vis-a-vis marriage because a lot of my friends are getting engaged out here in Austin and

30:21.920 --> 30:26.560
Rachel and I were like, one of the first, I would say couples to, to get married. And so like,

30:26.560 --> 30:32.880
I catch myself like saying to people like, you just got to make sure to really like in the moment,

30:32.880 --> 30:38.560
just really treasure it because, and I like barf in my own mouth and I'm like, I'm so sorry. I don't

30:38.560 --> 30:43.680
know what that was. I don't know who that was. I'm sorry. No, we all do it. I think Justin and I

30:43.680 --> 30:48.800
probably did it to both of you guys at your weddings. I mean, I think that's human nature.

30:48.800 --> 30:54.480
And I try to take a video with your mind posted on your soul Facebook. What are you saying to

30:54.480 --> 30:59.360
me right now? Just remember all the people who were here and how happy they were. And

30:59.360 --> 31:04.640
has anyone given you advice that you were like, Oh shit, that's tight. Yeah. Great. I'm going to

31:04.640 --> 31:11.040
do that. Um, you know, I didn't know about actually, I don't know if it's sort of advice,

31:11.040 --> 31:17.680
kind of a tip you and Rachel gave me that snuggle. Oh yeah. I didn't know that existed. Well, I mean,

31:17.680 --> 31:24.240
that's sort of like my whole game now is all about maximizing my, my sleeping structures.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.440
I'm sorry. I'm going to need someone to clarify for me what a snoogle is.

31:27.440 --> 31:36.080
Is it a snoogle or a snoodle? Snoogle. Okay. And it is what now? It's this giant pillow,

31:36.080 --> 31:42.240
like this long worm like pillow that kind of coils up and you can just wrap yourself like

31:42.240 --> 31:48.640
completely in it when you sleep. What? Yeah. Awesome. It's basically every sort of human

31:48.640 --> 31:54.400
invention and like thing that we have as a species have like figured out has culminated

31:54.400 --> 31:59.200
in the snoogle. Um, because it really takes your sleeping game. Can I, can I ask you a question

31:59.200 --> 32:05.280
Sydney, because you are now far more experienced with the snoogle than I am. Is it weird if I get

32:05.280 --> 32:11.600
one, even though I am not now, nor will I ever be pregnant and Rachel, Rachel will get pregnant at

32:11.600 --> 32:17.680
some point, but this is my snoogle actually, babe. Um, we can get a second one off Amazon, babe,

32:17.680 --> 32:22.800
but this one's mine. I've like sort of impressed onto it. My body contours already. You can have

32:22.800 --> 32:27.840
matching his and her snoogles. Oh no, because I wouldn't want to get it confused and then

32:27.840 --> 32:32.160
accidentally sleep using her snoogles and her impressions because that's a fate worse than

32:32.160 --> 32:37.520
death. It's, I think it's fine. Cause I fully intend to continue to sleep with this after I

32:37.520 --> 32:43.760
am no longer pregnant. Yeah. It's fantastic. Um, excellent. But, but most of the advice I get

32:43.760 --> 32:50.320
is not as helpful as the snoogle. Um, well no, cause that's actionable stuff. It's like if,

32:50.320 --> 32:55.200
if every piece of advice I got came with a hammock, I'd be like tight. Yes, I will take,

32:55.200 --> 32:59.920
I will take that. I will make my pizzas with a pizza stone. Thank you for the advice in the

32:59.920 --> 33:06.800
hammock. No, a lot of people want to give me advice about what they ate to like keep them

33:06.800 --> 33:10.400
from being nauseous. I've found that's the most common advice. And I keep telling people like,

33:10.400 --> 33:15.200
Oh, thanks. I'm not really nauseous anymore. Thanks. Just a Tina's pizzas is like basically

33:15.200 --> 33:19.840
it. Thank you though. I just want pizzas. And then a lot of people want to tell me about how

33:19.840 --> 33:27.200
I'm not going to sleep. This is why it always seems to me like the advice is like a schadenfreude

33:27.200 --> 33:31.200
kind of thing where it's like, well, you know, you're not going to sleep. You're going to puke

33:31.200 --> 33:36.400
a lot. You might poop yourself. It's like, it always is like this. It's, it never sounds helpful

33:36.400 --> 33:40.960
to me. You never know how bad it's going to be. Listen here. You think you know some shit. You

33:40.960 --> 33:47.360
don't know shit. It's going to be so much worse. That's exactly what it is. That's what people just

33:47.360 --> 33:51.600
want to tell you how bad things are going to get. And I don't know. I don't know what at the end,

33:51.600 --> 33:57.280
but Oh, but at the end you don't sleep ever again after it. You don't sleep over again,

33:57.280 --> 34:00.560
but they always cap it off with the same thing. Whatever terrible thing they've told you,

34:00.560 --> 34:03.520
you're going to never sleep. You're going to get puked all over. It's going to be awful.

34:03.520 --> 34:08.720
Then they say, Oh, but it's all worth it. It's all so much worth it. It's so worth it. It's like,

34:08.720 --> 34:14.160
well yeah, I freaking hope so. Or at this point, even if it's not, I'm kind of in too deep.

34:14.160 --> 34:22.320
I've committed myself. Yeah. We're at that. We're just going for it. So, so I don't know. My best,

34:22.320 --> 34:27.760
my best answer is I just, I try to stay calm and I don't listen a lot and I nod and smile.

34:28.320 --> 34:36.800
You should give them advice about how to fix whatever, um, like physical thing they might

34:36.800 --> 34:43.600
have wrong with them. Um, it looks like you're like, Hey, how's your diabetes going? Well,

34:43.600 --> 34:47.120
I mean, you don't have to go that personal. You can do like, Oh, great. Here's some advice about

34:47.120 --> 34:51.600
how to like make your bangs work for you. Cause right now they're working against you.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.920
That would work. Cause I don't know anything about that. So it would be good.

34:55.920 --> 34:59.760
You're fighting, you're fighting your bangs right now. You need to work with them as a team.

35:00.720 --> 35:04.720
You know, if all else fails, this works for me. I just say, Ooh, I've got to go pee again

35:04.720 --> 35:08.960
and walk away. That's you are not going to be able to play that smoke bomb card for much longer. You

35:08.960 --> 35:13.760
need to savor it while you can. There you go. I try to do that same thing now and people just

35:13.760 --> 35:19.920
look at me like I'm disgusting. I'm going to go pee. I got to pee later. Now see when pregnancy,

35:19.920 --> 35:23.440
you got to revel in that. Oh, I've got to pee again. And everybody always understands it.

35:27.200 --> 35:33.120
And then it's adorable too. Oh, she's got to pee again. Oh, cause there's a baby in there.

35:33.120 --> 35:38.640
Um, Sydney, do you want to thank you for sharing some light on shedding some light on this? Do you

35:38.640 --> 35:45.040
want to take us to the money zone? Sure. I'll, I'll drive us there. Justin usually says like a thing,

35:45.040 --> 35:51.120
like, uh, um, if you need to support a baby, yeah, stuff like that. Like he usually does like a fun

35:51.120 --> 35:56.880
thing like that or something about us needing money. So, um, here's some great pregnancy advice

35:56.880 --> 36:00.800
for everybody. If you're gonna raise a child, you know what you need for that? You need to

36:00.800 --> 36:05.760
if you're gonna raise a child, you know what you need for that? What? Lots of money. There you see.

36:05.760 --> 36:22.480
That was great. Was that good? Yeah. Got a message to Alita from Will. It's, uh,

36:23.040 --> 36:30.320
I guess rhyming couplets, I guess. Are you, you get really, really uncomfortable with having to

36:30.320 --> 36:36.320
like be a vessel for other people's romance. No, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. I was gonna

36:36.320 --> 36:45.840
make it really erotic. Yeah. That's because he can't not. Oh boy. Dripping with eroticism. No,

36:45.840 --> 36:50.640
no, no, no. Let Justin do it. You're ruining it. You filled me with love and joy since before I

36:50.640 --> 36:58.320
got on one knee, but marriage to you is greater still. It's how we were meant to be. I know not

36:58.320 --> 37:03.840
what next year will bring, the sights that we will see, but I don't care where you go

37:03.840 --> 37:11.040
as long as it's with me. Happy first real life married anniversary. I don't know if they meant

37:11.040 --> 37:18.160
for that last part to rhyme. You definitely made it work. I just did my best. I'm sorry, Alita. No,

37:18.160 --> 37:23.920
Will. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry, Alita. That's both of you. That's your celeb name. See, that's

37:23.920 --> 37:29.200
the best gift we can give them. Yeah, you got a celeb name. Not a big deal. Griffin Trav. Travis.

37:29.200 --> 37:35.280
Yes. We got any other important messages? Yeah, this one is for Jody, and it's from

37:37.520 --> 37:44.800
Bayon or Bayon? Bayon. Say all of them and they can just. Yeah, that's just for the Justin McElroy

37:44.800 --> 37:49.600
scattershot method. This is for Jody from Bayon, Bayon, Bayon, Bayon, Bayon. Bayon,

37:49.600 --> 37:56.960
Bayon. Wait, Wayman, Wayman. Vega. This is from Vega from Street Fighter. Hey, Bubby, what's up?

37:56.960 --> 38:00.880
Hope you're having a sweet day, but why don't you go ahead and open up that glove compartment and

38:00.880 --> 38:07.360
see what's inside? Oh, Jesus. What's that you say? Travis, what is that? I can't, I can't take it.

38:07.360 --> 38:19.440
A gun? Is it a gun? Oh my God. A ring? Dun, dun, dun. Will you marry me? Oh my God. God, Bayon.

38:19.440 --> 38:23.920
It was a gun. Get down. Oh no, get out of the car. Get out of, just kidding. Say yes, God.

38:23.920 --> 38:31.200
Say yes to the gun. That is beautiful. I'm so happy. Congratulations. No, I know there's,

38:31.200 --> 38:35.600
right now there's, oh, listen, we, we should like just give them a minute. Cause right now there's

38:35.600 --> 38:40.560
like that afterglow where it's like, I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe

38:40.560 --> 38:45.600
Travis asked me to marry him. I can't believe you did it like this. This is so romantic. What were

38:45.600 --> 38:50.080
you thinking Bayon, you asshole? I want to mention something. What I, my favorite thing about this,

38:50.080 --> 38:54.480
uh, proposal, let them, we'll give them their moment. Yeah. And the rest of us will talk over

38:54.480 --> 38:58.480
here. Bayon, just like turn the volume down for like a minute. Cause we're going to say dumb

38:58.480 --> 39:02.240
shit and we're just going to like step all over your magic moment. Yeah. So have your magic moment,

39:02.240 --> 39:07.520
pause it and then come back. My favorite thing about this message is that it says,

39:07.520 --> 39:13.040
it literally says dramatic pause on here, but there is no dramatic pause. The dramatic pause

39:13.040 --> 39:20.800
is between a ring question mark and will you marry me? So not a dramatic pause as the contents

39:20.800 --> 39:27.120
of the glove compartment are revealed, but a dramatic pause is the reality. What could this

39:27.120 --> 39:33.920
ring mean? What is this ring? We also don't know if we gave, if we gave Jody enough time to open

39:33.920 --> 39:39.280
the glove compartment to see what she might've had hands full of taco bell. Why don't she listen to

39:39.280 --> 39:44.160
this while she's like sitting in bed? I love compartment. I don't know what you mean. What

39:44.160 --> 39:48.480
if the money zone starts on this episode and Bayon's driving and he just keeps discouraging

39:48.480 --> 39:52.160
her from picking things up. Put that down, put that down, put it down. Keep your hands free.

39:52.160 --> 39:56.480
Keep your hands free. You are holding, you are double fisting Crunchwrap Supremes right now.

39:56.480 --> 39:59.840
You need to put at least one of them down because I need you to have a free hand. If not both,

39:59.840 --> 40:04.880
cause I'm worried about you. Also. Yes. That's too many Crunchwraps. Speaking of snacking smarter.

40:04.880 --> 40:09.040
Hold on. Let's congratulations Jody and Bayon. We're very, very, very happy. Thank you for sharing

40:09.040 --> 40:13.040
your, your super special moment with us. That's incredibly nice. We have a mission for you.

40:13.040 --> 40:17.680
Listeners. A mission. You're a snack smarter and you're going to get in shape by summer.

40:18.320 --> 40:24.560
Your enemy, the vending machine. Don't go running. What just happened? What? Did Travis just drop

40:24.560 --> 40:30.480
off? No, no. He was just on my sales pitch. Okay. You guys were just like trading. Sorry.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.680
Well, it was like, that's what it sounds like when people get into a rhythm. I know it's so,

40:33.680 --> 40:39.600
so rare on our show that you think that we're having technical difficulties when people are

40:39.600 --> 40:45.680
actually actually communicating. Is Skype breaking up? Now we're just like working together and like

40:45.680 --> 40:51.920
having a conversation like without talking all over each other. It's weird. Anyway. Naturebox

40:51.920 --> 40:57.920

40:57.920 --> 41:03.520
great tasting. Right in your face. A Naturebox funnel technician will kick in your door and start

41:03.520 --> 41:08.640
jamming it right down there. They got BBQ kettle kernels. They got everything. Bagel sticks.

They got South Pacific plantain chips and over a hundred more options. Wow. Really? Yeah. Have they

41:15.520 --> 41:20.240
been expanding their game? Their game is like elevated. Every time you go back, they have,

41:20.240 --> 41:27.280
they legally have to have new snacks based on what I just said. So salted caramel pretzel pops

41:27.280 --> 41:33.840
are my jam. I would also recommend they have some like French toast granola. That's like really,

41:34.400 --> 41:40.080
really good if you want that. And it's all like real. There's no like high fructose corn syrup

41:40.080 --> 41:46.720

professional website or online portfolio. Uh, it's a, it's a platform. A lot of, uh, people,

42:45.680 --> 42:49.840
I think who listen to the show are familiar with it because they've, they've helped us out with

42:49.840 --> 42:55.600
sponsorships before. Uh, but they've been improving the platform really frequently since, since, uh,

42:55.600 --> 42:59.440
since they started advertising with us, there's new features and designs and better support for

42:59.440 --> 43:06.480
the platform. They have a new, like sort of, uh, uh, uh, tailored, like pre-made designs that you

43:06.480 --> 43:12.480
can start with and a lot of options to change it. And so to look tight to begin with, and then you

43:12.480 --> 43:19.040

43:19.040 --> 43:23.360

43:28.480 --> 43:32.320
inspiration is going to strike, you know, I don't know when I'm going to want to work on my webpage.

43:32.880 --> 43:38.320
Maybe I'll want it to do in the afternoon or 3 am or whatever. I got to follow the muse. Sure.

like go back? They'll talk you down from a bad LSD trip. You need to drink three waters.

43:59.840 --> 44:04.800
Go drink three waters. Get in bed. Somebody get this man, some orange juice and graham cracker

44:04.800 --> 44:09.200
and stay calm. You need to spend to the chill out to it. You need to get him to the job.

44:09.200 --> 44:13.040

45:04.400 --> 45:08.720
I'm the new host of International Waters, the transatlantic comedy show where land laws

45:08.720 --> 45:13.120
do not apply. I am here with one of our writers, Sarah Morgan from the UK. Hello,

45:13.120 --> 45:16.800
Sarah. Hi, Dave. How are you doing? I didn't understand a word you just said. Could you

45:16.800 --> 45:21.840
explain International Waters and how it works? It's a transatlantic panel game. We have teams

45:21.840 --> 45:28.720
based in the UK and in LA, and basically people try to be funnier more than they try to know

45:28.720 --> 45:33.520
things. I caught about half of that. Find International Waters on maximumfun.org.

45:33.520 --> 45:39.040
Thank you for your attention. I will see you on International Waters. Do you guys want a Yahoo?

45:39.040 --> 45:43.440
Please. This one was sent in by Charles Decker. Thanks, Charles. It's by Yahoo Answers user.

45:44.800 --> 45:50.640
Wait for it to load on Yahoo's new shitty website. This is asked by Yahoo Answers user Travelman

45:50.640 --> 45:57.120
who asks, how do Popeye's employees know you've eaten there before?

45:58.800 --> 46:01.920
Oh, the first time I have to say anything else, I get it.

46:02.480 --> 46:05.760
The first time I went there, they just said welcome to Popeye's.

46:06.320 --> 46:12.320
But now they always say welcome back to Popeye's. How do they know I've eaten there before?

46:12.320 --> 46:19.200
Hmm. Statistically speaking-

46:19.200 --> 46:21.760
Everyone's eating. Everyone's eating at Popeye's.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.640
I have to tell you guys, I've never eaten at Popeye's.

46:24.640 --> 46:28.560
I've never eaten at a fucking Popeye's. Griffin, you haven't fucked, you fucking liar.

46:28.560 --> 46:32.320
When did I eat at a Popeye's? When there was a Popeye's, there was a Popeye's like

46:32.320 --> 46:35.520
right across the main road from our apartment when we lived in Batavia.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.680
And you just assumed that I fucking hoved over there at some point.

46:37.680 --> 46:41.360
No, we ate there together. I brought you back some Popeye's,

46:41.360 --> 46:47.200
we ate it together like brothers. It was a special goddamn moment in our

46:47.200 --> 46:48.320
relationship. It was a moment.

46:48.320 --> 46:51.680
How could you fucking forget that? I can't believe you don't remember it.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.480
Right, but I can't- When we finally became brothers.

46:54.480 --> 46:57.680
If I cross the threshold of the Popeye's, are they gonna be like, hey, I know you've

46:57.680 --> 47:00.880
never been here before, but you've consumed our products, so welcome here.

47:00.880 --> 47:03.280
Welcome back for the first time, if you know what I mean.

47:03.280 --> 47:08.080
Griffin McElroy, Social Security Number 138311412.

47:08.080 --> 47:12.240
I'm sensing a real opportunity to open one of these in Huntington.

47:12.240 --> 47:15.840
Just because, like, there isn't one and everyone needs it to stay alive?

47:16.560 --> 47:21.040
Yeah, apparently everyone's been there except all of us, so maybe if I open one-

47:21.840 --> 47:25.280
You open a- You open a Popeye's, and right next door, Jack in the Box,

47:25.280 --> 47:28.800
and you'll be a very rich man. Did you guys hear the news, by the way?

47:28.800 --> 47:30.480
We got a- We got a Chipotle now, so you have to come back.

47:30.480 --> 47:32.320
I know, we talked about this in the last- We talked about this in the last-

47:32.320 --> 47:34.800
We talked about it- You can come back.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.080
It- But it opened. But it opened.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.960
You think- Hold up, you think that's why Travis and I bounced, is we were like,

47:39.840 --> 47:42.240
no big fat burritos? I can't get any Chipotle here.

47:43.440 --> 47:46.960
I just figured that's why you left. It w- I knew it wasn't me,

47:46.960 --> 47:49.760
so I figured it was Chipotle. It wasn't you?

47:49.760 --> 47:52.480
It was guacamole. It's the guacamoles.

47:53.600 --> 48:00.640
I've- I haven't been to Popeye's, but I guess they're- Okay, I have an answer.

48:00.640 --> 48:04.960
I think that they say welcome back to Popeye's, because if they said welcome to Popeye's,

48:04.960 --> 48:08.000
what that puts on the employees is this expectation

48:08.000 --> 48:12.800
that you're gonna have to explain all the nuance to ordering at Popeye's.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.080
You have to give them the full sales pitch. None of them want to do that.

48:16.080 --> 48:21.600
So to circumvent having to walk you through the experience of choosing your breading

48:21.600 --> 48:26.240
and biscuit combos, they say welcome back to Popeye's and just assume that you know the drill.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.640
Sure. It's like when you run into somebody at a party,

48:29.280 --> 48:31.040
and you can't remember if you've met them before,

48:31.040 --> 48:34.160
um, and so you just go, hey man! Like that.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.800
Exactly. That's exactly- Yes, that's exactly.

48:36.800 --> 48:41.200
And then of course, you haven't met them before, and you look like a fucking crazy person.

48:41.200 --> 48:44.640
But if you commit to it, they look like they have amnesia.

48:44.640 --> 48:45.200
Right. Right.

48:46.080 --> 48:49.840
Does Popeye's embed all of us with secret ID chips in traps all around?

48:49.840 --> 48:50.880
Oh, yeah. Okay.

48:51.520 --> 48:55.040
I mean, I just- I mean, I know it was a pretty obvious question. I just wanted to like-

48:55.040 --> 48:58.080
You think that's what the spice is made out of? Secret ID chips?

48:58.080 --> 49:00.160
Is there spice on that- on that food?

49:00.160 --> 49:01.120
On that food?

49:01.120 --> 49:02.560
No, if you don't get it spicy.

49:02.560 --> 49:03.060
Okay.

49:04.160 --> 49:09.200
But they strongly recommend you get it spicy, otherwise they can't track you.

49:09.200 --> 49:11.360
That's how I stayed off the grid this long.

49:11.360 --> 49:16.480
Listen, Suga, how are we gonna be able to keep tabs on you, sweet baby?

49:18.080 --> 49:19.760
Who is this employee?

49:19.760 --> 49:22.160
That's the lady who's in their commercials.

49:23.120 --> 49:29.600
She's like a southern sort of southern lady who welcomes you back with open arms.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.680
Come on and eat on my nano machines.

49:34.480 --> 49:37.040
Don't you want to get super strong, Suga?

49:41.120 --> 49:43.360
I'll activate the dailiest protocol.

49:45.360 --> 49:48.720
That's my guarantee to you, Suga. Just go ahead and suck them down.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.400
Suck down these marrow bones.

49:50.400 --> 49:53.840
You'll get to jump super high and we'll know everything that you buy and eat.

49:56.000 --> 49:56.720
No problem.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.040
They can talk to your credit card.

49:59.040 --> 50:00.240
That's convenient, Suga.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.120
Oh boy.

50:05.120 --> 50:10.960
Is it okay to play music from my phone to cover up any possible sounds made

50:10.960 --> 50:13.840
while using a bathroom at work or in public?

50:13.840 --> 50:16.160
And that- this person has-

50:16.160 --> 50:18.320
Holy shit, the bravery.

50:18.320 --> 50:22.640
This person has neglected to come up with a clever nom de plume.

50:22.640 --> 50:25.760
Should we- it was clearly an accident that he didn't do this.

50:25.760 --> 50:28.320
Can we come up with one for him, please?

50:28.320 --> 50:28.720
Sure.

50:28.720 --> 50:30.480
All right, let's- what do we know about him?

50:30.480 --> 50:32.640
We know his name is Kirk and he lives in Maryland.

50:32.640 --> 50:36.160
And he uses the bathroom and he's apparently real, real noisy in there.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.680
Okay, so I don't know-

50:37.680 --> 50:43.040
Whatever he's doing in there, he's making a significant amount of decibels doing it.

50:43.040 --> 50:43.600
That's from-

50:44.320 --> 50:46.000
Decibel-deucing in Maryland.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.120
That's from decibel-deucing in Maryland.

50:50.320 --> 50:55.280
So, I think that's too obvious.

50:55.280 --> 51:02.000
The best thing you could do is wait for flush windows, which I think we've all done, right?

51:02.000 --> 51:05.200
Your- your problem isn't that this is-

51:05.200 --> 51:07.200
Your problem is that it's obvious that if you-

51:07.200 --> 51:10.320
if you go to the bathroom and the person in the stall next to you

51:10.320 --> 51:13.440
is fucking rocking out to Splish Splash, I was taking a bath,

51:15.120 --> 51:19.120
then you think like, oh, that person's playing music because they're pooping.

51:19.120 --> 51:24.400
You don't think, why is there music in the bathroom right now?

51:24.400 --> 51:28.320
I mean, because that's- okay, not to get a little blue,

51:29.040 --> 51:32.000
but the sound- pooping sounds belong in the bathroom.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.840
No one is upset by hearing those.

51:33.840 --> 51:34.640
I am upset.

51:34.640 --> 51:35.200
They make cringe.

51:35.200 --> 51:35.920
Every could I-

51:35.920 --> 51:37.520
They make cringe slightly.

51:37.520 --> 51:38.720
Every time.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.440
I'm not kidding.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.280
I'm a grown ass man.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.640
I just bought a house.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.160
I own land.

51:44.160 --> 51:48.400
If I hear someone make loud poop sounds in the bathroom in the stall next to me,

51:48.400 --> 51:50.880
I have to suppress a laugh every time.

51:50.880 --> 51:55.760
I have to suppress a laugh every time, 100% of the time.

51:56.640 --> 52:00.240
Okay, this might sound outlandish to a lot of people listening right now.

52:00.240 --> 52:03.040
When I was in Japan, all of their fucking super toilets

52:03.040 --> 52:07.280
that beat the shit out of our toilets, our dumb caveman toilets,

52:07.280 --> 52:08.640
have incredible buttons on them,

52:08.640 --> 52:11.200
like one that will blow a sweet scent into your butt

52:11.200 --> 52:13.440
and one that will shoot water into your butt.

52:13.440 --> 52:16.960
A lot of things involving putting things in your butt to make it a better butt.

52:16.960 --> 52:19.920
What it also has is a noise button that you can play

52:19.920 --> 52:23.120
and it will make the sound very, very loud,

52:23.120 --> 52:26.800
shockingly, surprisingly loud, of just running water.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.000
This is good for two reasons.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.160
One, it helps sort of get things going.

52:30.160 --> 52:35.680
Two, it disguises your shame with the sound that's already pretty natural in the bathroom,

52:35.680 --> 52:39.280
but better than the alternative of the sound that your butt is definitely already making.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.640
Yeah, no response to that.

52:42.640 --> 52:46.080
That's because you both realized that all three of us live in the wrong fucking country.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.240
Yeah.

52:48.240 --> 52:52.080
You know, what I found when I was in Scotland is that they've developed technology

52:52.080 --> 52:57.600
in which when the stall doors close, they overlap so that you cannot peek through them.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.120
I really appreciate that.

52:59.120 --> 53:02.720
There are, if you're gonna play music,

53:02.720 --> 53:05.280
there are a couple of things that are important to do.

53:05.280 --> 53:09.600
The first one is you have to also say out loud,

53:09.600 --> 53:11.840
where is that music coming from?

53:11.840 --> 53:15.840
Are they piping that in so you can cover up that it's coming from you?

53:15.840 --> 53:19.360
Second, play something that's gonna blend in really nicely,

53:19.360 --> 53:21.760
like perhaps the music of 311,

53:21.760 --> 53:25.120
that is largely indistinguishable from the sound of someone making a mountain.

53:29.760 --> 53:30.960
Is audiobooks better?

53:32.880 --> 53:33.520
You know what?

53:34.320 --> 53:36.720
No, because then you might think someone's talking to you.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.400
What about live streaming like NPR?

53:40.400 --> 53:43.360
Do you think there's somebody who uses our podcast to poop too secretly?

53:43.360 --> 53:44.800
Yeah, yeah.

53:44.800 --> 53:46.480
I mean, just statistically, yes.

53:46.480 --> 53:51.200
Maybe, could you play loud, like whimsical pooping sounds

53:51.200 --> 53:53.440
to cover your real ass pooping sounds?

53:53.440 --> 53:56.160
Just like go Elton John on the fart piano?

53:56.160 --> 53:58.880
Yeah, seems to me.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.800
But then, because then whoever is listening will be like,

54:02.800 --> 54:04.080
ah, some jokester.

54:04.080 --> 54:06.320
Some jokester and he was trying to make a joke.

54:06.320 --> 54:08.560
And then you do that enough and then you become the office jokester.

54:08.560 --> 54:10.160
It's like, ah, that's Kirk.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.600
Dude, oh shit, I said his name.

54:11.600 --> 54:16.000
No, I'm sorry, Kirk.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.760
Now everyone will know that Kirk poops.

54:19.280 --> 54:22.800
You become the office jokester.

54:22.800 --> 54:26.160
If you're in Maryland and you meet a Kirk, just know this,

54:26.160 --> 54:27.280
he has made a vowel movement.

54:27.280 --> 54:29.440
He has made at least one whoopsie daisy.

54:30.960 --> 54:33.760
If you become Kirk the office jokester on the fart piano

54:33.760 --> 54:35.440
and everybody knows when they hear that,

54:35.440 --> 54:37.760
then like, oh, it's just Kirk acting a fool.

54:37.760 --> 54:40.400
And then you can start phasing the application out.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.600
Then you can start phasing the app out of the rotation.

54:44.240 --> 54:46.560
Yeah, just then when you make a vowel movement,

54:46.560 --> 54:48.080
all you have to do is shout, get it?

54:48.880 --> 54:50.000
Oh, that's over him.

54:50.000 --> 54:50.720
Oh, I love that.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.880
He's using the fart sax button.

54:52.880 --> 54:54.320
That is a fart sax solo.

54:54.320 --> 54:57.360
That's my very, very favorite button on his fart piano app.

54:57.360 --> 54:58.400
No, it's not.

54:58.400 --> 54:58.880
He doesn't.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.600
All right, listen, thank you guys so much

55:03.600 --> 55:04.800
for hanging out with us this week.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.000
We hope you had a lot of fun.

55:07.040 --> 55:10.080
One last thank you to everybody who gave in the Max Fun Drive.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.320
We crushed previous records.

55:13.040 --> 55:16.720
We had over 2,500 new donors and upgrading donors.

55:16.720 --> 55:17.840
That's amazing.

55:17.840 --> 55:19.440
That's fucking bananas, guys.

55:19.440 --> 55:20.800
Thank you so much.

55:20.800 --> 55:22.640
I thought maybe this was gonna be the year

55:22.640 --> 55:23.920
when everybody was finally like,

55:24.880 --> 55:25.920
we're giving money to this?

55:26.640 --> 55:28.720
But instead they were like, we need to give money to this.

55:29.840 --> 55:30.800
It's unbelievable.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.200
So thank you guys.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.760
You're the absolute best, best, best.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.960
Make sure you listen to some other programs

55:38.960 --> 55:40.960
on the Maximum Fun Network.

55:41.520 --> 55:42.640
We've got a lot now.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.280
Got a lot of different offerings for you.

55:45.280 --> 55:48.640
There's the Goose Down is very funny.

55:49.760 --> 55:51.280
Lady to Lady is very funny.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.680
Oh no, Ross and Carrie is another great one.

55:53.680 --> 55:54.720
Bullseye.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.240
If you liked when Sydney stepped in

55:56.240 --> 55:57.360
and helped us out with a question

55:57.360 --> 55:59.360
and you haven't listened to Sawbones yet,

55:59.360 --> 56:01.040
first of all, what's the matter with you?

56:01.040 --> 56:02.560
Second of all, go listen to Sawbones.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.480
Justin and Sydney host it and it's awesome.

56:06.320 --> 56:08.800
So thanks to people tweeting about the show.

56:08.800 --> 56:12.400
Rhodes Clark got his donation in under the wire.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.920
So thank you so much.

56:13.920 --> 56:16.320
Thank you to Tim Brick and A. Foster

56:16.320 --> 56:19.120
and Paperback Princess Emile Dallaire.

56:19.840 --> 56:20.800
I'll just take a shot there.

56:20.800 --> 56:24.240
Alyssa Jefferson, Nick, John Rom, Ashley,

56:25.600 --> 56:29.360
Honey Boy, The Tontons, so many others.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.840
Thank you so much for tweeting about our program.

56:31.840 --> 56:33.680
The Tontons are a band by the way.

56:33.680 --> 56:36.000
I know, I feel so bad they invited me to come hang out

56:36.000 --> 56:38.320
at one of their shows here in Austin

56:38.320 --> 56:42.880
and I was too busy getting horribly, horribly sunburned

56:42.880 --> 56:45.680
in a different city or else it would have been there.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.440
Thanks again to Nature Box.

They've got awesome shit there and we're all big fans.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.520
And a big thanks to John Roderick of the Long Winters

57:09.520 --> 57:11.440
for the East Front Team song It's a Departure

57:11.440 --> 57:13.280
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

57:14.640 --> 57:17.280
We've been singing the praises of that album for a long time

57:17.280 --> 57:19.120
but it really is very good.

57:19.120 --> 57:22.880
Do wish there was a new album to talk about and promote.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.200
I would like that very much.

57:25.200 --> 57:27.280
I would like that very, very much if that could happen.

57:27.920 --> 57:28.640
But you know what?

57:29.360 --> 57:33.200
The wind is gonna blow where it's gonna blow

57:33.200 --> 57:34.240
and you can't change it.

57:34.240 --> 57:35.680
But you can't control the wind.

57:35.680 --> 57:38.400
Can't control the wind and what is John Roderick but the wind?

57:39.200 --> 57:41.040
He is the wind of people.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.680
Anyway, thank you John and company.

57:44.640 --> 57:48.880
We are going to be performing a live show on May 24th

57:48.880 --> 57:51.680
at the People's Improv Theater in beautiful New York City.

57:52.480 --> 57:55.680
As you may have seen, tickets for that are sold out

57:55.680 --> 58:01.200
but we are going to be releasing more tickets Wednesday at noon.

58:01.200 --> 58:07.760
So just go to the pit-nyc.com and you will be able

58:07.760 --> 58:11.360
to get those tickets Wednesday around noon-ish.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.920
So keep an eye out.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.680
We don't actually like the ones pulling the trigger

58:15.680 --> 58:19.120
so we can't guarantee at noon but that's the plan.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.040
Wednesday at noon, more tickets.

58:22.400 --> 58:23.360
I think that's gonna do it for us.

58:23.360 --> 58:26.240
Kripp, do you have a question that you could maybe read for us

58:26.240 --> 58:28.720
from Yahoo and then we can kind of think about it

58:28.720 --> 58:30.640
in the intervening week and we'll answer it next week?

58:30.640 --> 58:31.360
Oh, absolutely.

58:31.360 --> 58:33.200
This final Yahoo was sent in by Brian Couch.

58:33.200 --> 58:33.840
Thank you, Brian.

58:33.840 --> 58:36.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Calamity who asks,

58:38.080 --> 58:41.760
how do I keep my son from naming my grandson YOLO?

58:45.440 --> 58:46.720
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:46.720 --> 58:47.760
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:47.760 --> 58:48.720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:48.720 --> 58:49.920
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

58:49.920 --> 59:01.920
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

59:20.080 --> 59:22.640
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

59:22.640 --> 59:25.360
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

59:25.360 --> 59:28.080
You get an inside look into the creative and technical process

59:28.080 --> 59:30.320
and a unique view of a song by hearing just the drums

59:32.320 --> 59:36.720
or just the guitars or say just a Wurlitzer piano.

59:39.840 --> 59:41.760
If you're a fan of music, if you make music

59:41.760 --> 59:43.360
or if you just like to learn how things are made,

59:43.360 --> 59:45.520
come check it out on MaximumFun.org.

59:45.520 --> 59:50.160
Thanks.
