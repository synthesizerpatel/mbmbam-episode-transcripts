00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:46.800
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.680
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy,

00:55.680 --> 01:01.840
and it's an advice show for the modern era. I don't know why Justin didn't say that this time.

01:01.840 --> 01:08.160
Do you hear that, boys? Do you hear that, boys? When you hear hoofbeats, think derby! Not zebras.

01:09.920 --> 01:10.720
Derby time!

01:10.720 --> 01:16.720
It's derby time, everybody. Put on your cool hats. There's ribbons, and mine has two pinwheels.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.960
I have created a little game out of the derby competitors. I have made

01:20.960 --> 01:27.280
a list of names, sets of three. One name is real, two were made up. Griffin,

01:27.280 --> 01:29.680
you're gonna go first. Tell me which of these names, now wait.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.240
Two things.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.880
We do have to give, like, do we, if we play this game with you, do we have to pay royalties?

01:34.880 --> 01:36.240
We do have to give our dude money.

01:36.240 --> 01:36.560
We do, yes.

01:36.560 --> 01:40.720
Okay, the other thing is that I watched it, so like, I'm gonna fucking destroy you. So,

01:40.720 --> 01:47.120
I like, watched it. I like, got a mia julep in my hand, and I drank it,

01:47.120 --> 01:52.320
uh, drank it down smooth, and I got fucking blitzed, and I watched these griffonies go.

01:52.320 --> 01:56.320
Combine the two worlds of the derby, Griffin, get a big wide-brimmed hat,

01:56.320 --> 02:02.800
right? And then tape two mint juleps to the sides of each side of the hat, and then you take a straw

02:02.800 --> 02:03.280
down.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.320
Two what?

02:04.320 --> 02:10.480
Sorry, mint julep. And then have, like, big straws that come down to your mouth from the hat.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.920
That's the only way to derby, um, just scientifically speaking.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.760
All right, give me these fucking horses.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.720
I want to talk about the derby more, so let's play Travis's game first.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.360
Okay, which of these names is real? Griffin.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.040
Thundersnow.

02:25.040 --> 02:25.440
That's fake.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.120
Earth, wind, and lightning.

02:27.120 --> 02:27.600
That's fake.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.440
Pants on fire.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.320
None of those are real.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.600
I'm sorry, Thundersnow is correct.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.360
No, it wasn't. No, come on. It wasn't in the race. I watched the race, and there was no

02:37.360 --> 02:38.320
Thundersnow.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.920
It was Thundersnow. Thundersnow placed, let me see here.

02:41.920 --> 02:48.320
Here, do-do-do-do-do, Thundersnow didn't do great 20th out of 20th.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.600
Okay, here's my thing on horse racing, and I've got a whole bit that you guys are just

02:51.600 --> 02:52.640
gonna love on this.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.560
First place, you win. Your owner gets, like, a million dollars, and you get to bust, like,

02:56.560 --> 02:58.240
the deepest nut ever that night.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.520
Congratulations.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.120
Two, three, four, five, you get the wreath, and I guess your owner still gets a considerable

03:03.120 --> 03:06.400
amount of money, but, like, you just get to bust a regular nut.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.920
Five through ten, you're fine.

03:07.920 --> 03:12.400
Anything after that, they should have, like, a collapsible pit that just opens up on the

03:12.400 --> 03:17.920
track that all of the horses just fall down into, into, like, the pony pile, and then

03:17.920 --> 03:21.280
the pit opens back up, and then we don't talk about those horses ever again.

03:21.280 --> 03:25.520
Twentieth place, are you fucking kidding me? Twentieth place, 10th on the underground pile.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.800
That's it. You're done.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.880
I would own Thundersnow.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.480
Listen, the owner of Thundersnow, if you're looking to get him off your hands, I'll take

03:32.480 --> 03:32.640
it.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.400
Travis, you don't have to own Thundersnow.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.000
Thundersnow got thoroughly fucking owned yesterday in that race.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.280
It got put in its place by fucking, what was the winner, Cream Dream, and I think Cream

03:43.280 --> 03:44.560
Dream won it.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.920
Was number one Cream Dream?

03:45.920 --> 03:48.720
All right, Justin, which of these names is real?

03:48.720 --> 03:52.480
Cream Dream, if Cream Dream is one of the three, it's real.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.680
Justin, slow and steady, fast and accurate, sloppy boy.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.560
All three describe me and sex.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.680
I wish sloppy boy was real, but I think it's fast and accurate.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.520
It is fast and accurate, that is correct.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.200
That's a bullshit name for a horse.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.880
Four legs and hooves.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.520
It's like, what, long head and big body.

04:12.080 --> 04:17.600
Griffin, pinch me, I'm dreaming, guaranteed winner, or state of honor.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.440
State of honor is real.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.040
State of honor is real.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.240
I came in like third, I think.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.760
I watched that one, I'm not kidding.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.960
State of honor was fourth.

04:24.960 --> 04:30.160
Oh, no, sorry, state of honor was, oh, no, state of honor was, no, no, no, no, no, no,

04:30.160 --> 04:32.080
state of honor was 19th in the pile.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.560
Travis, can we bring your game to an abrupt end?

04:35.200 --> 04:37.920
But I have, okay, wait, let me give you this last one, Justin.

04:37.920 --> 04:38.640
Okay, last one.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.640
Williams, Steffaly, or Gervin.

04:43.920 --> 04:44.640
Gervin.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.680
Gervin is correct.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.280
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, I'm Gervin McElroy, I'm Steffaly.

04:50.240 --> 04:56.000
Three of the, I pulled up the list after Travis's game was over.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.040
And I, there are three different horses in this fucking race out of 20 or two or something.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.880
There's three fucking horses that sound like someone trying to pronounce Gervin's name

05:06.880 --> 05:07.440
and failing.

05:07.440 --> 05:07.920
Gormley.

05:07.920 --> 05:13.360
There is a, there's a Gervin, there's a Gunavera, and there's a Gormley.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.040
Wait, is it Gormley McElroy?

05:15.040 --> 05:15.920
No, it's not Gormley.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.040
Gormley McCracken?

05:17.760 --> 05:18.720
Gormley McCracken?

05:18.720 --> 05:19.760
McCracken's another one, by the way.

05:19.760 --> 05:25.040
I'm 30 under 30, Gormley, sweet cream dream McCracken.

05:25.040 --> 05:25.520
McCracken.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.320
It's Gormley McCracken, no, Gervin?

05:30.320 --> 05:32.800
It's this great podcast, it's the McCracken brothers.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.200
And the littlest one is such a card, Gorpels.

05:38.960 --> 05:46.000
I celebrated the, I celebrated the derby, which was also free comic book day.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.200
So I was downtown, stopped by Purple Earth, got some books, and I went to the press club

05:51.200 --> 05:55.680
for lunch, which is like a, it's kind of like a bar restaurant kind of vibe.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.480
So we're sitting there as-

05:56.480 --> 06:00.240
Stacey Panini's, hence the press in the name, you get it.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.480
Yeah, there was two things about this.

06:04.480 --> 06:09.200
One, it's buck wild that there's two hours of coverage for an event no one cares about

06:09.200 --> 06:12.240
any other day of the year for 15 seconds of event.

06:12.240 --> 06:12.800
That's fine.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.640
To fill that, one of the segments I saw was, you know, there's celebrities here,

06:18.640 --> 06:26.160
and they're like, here are the celebrities, Harry Connick Jr., Travis Tritt, end of montage.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.040
That was like, whoa, a rough year for the derb.

06:31.040 --> 06:38.480
But as we're the only people in the restaurant, as we are like waiting for the race to begin,

06:38.480 --> 06:42.480
I mean, we're not, we're eating pizza, but like the race was about to begin,

06:42.480 --> 06:47.440
an elderly gentleman comes in and just stands at the bar, staring at the screen,

06:47.440 --> 06:49.440
gets himself a beer, drains it.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.360
And as the race begins, he just starts yelling, come on.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.600
Like that will make the race-

06:55.600 --> 06:56.240
Come on!

06:56.240 --> 06:58.800
Like that'll make the race begin faster or-

06:58.800 --> 06:59.360
Come on!

06:59.360 --> 07:02.320
No, as the race has begun, he's yelling, come on.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.120
But he's not mentioning any horses.

07:05.120 --> 07:10.480
So it gives him the vibe of like, he's just trying to be encouraging.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.000
Like he just wants all the horses to come on a bit faster.

07:14.000 --> 07:14.800
He wants a good race, yeah.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.640
He just wants a good race out there.

07:16.640 --> 07:17.920
Important question.

07:17.920 --> 07:24.080
At the end of the race, did he pull some sort of paper stub out of perhaps a breast pocket,

07:24.080 --> 07:26.160
tear it up and jump up and down on it?

07:26.160 --> 07:27.120
No, that's the-

07:28.320 --> 07:29.440
Okay, this is the other thing.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.080
When the race is over, no reaction.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.520
Like he, I guess he's just in it for speed.

07:35.520 --> 07:39.360
He just loves the speed or something, because he did not care who won or lost.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.720
He just wanted her to come on.

07:40.720 --> 07:46.400
Maybe he just, he really likes watching, or like he is committed to watching the derby,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.320
but doesn't actually enjoy doing it.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.200
And like, he just knows like, maybe there's a group of people at work who always talk about the derby.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.880
And he's like, I'm going to watch it this year.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.680
But as soon as he started, it was like, I already hate this.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.560
Come on, please just finish it.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.320
Finish it.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.120
So yeah, derby.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.200
Derby again, derby time.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.120
Congratulations to Cream Dreams.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.840
Congratulations to Cream Dreams, the winner.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.840
That's not the name, that's not-

08:13.840 --> 08:18.000
Just Googled about Thundersnow, injury on the track, muddy.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.160
I said, this track will, this race will have at least one horse destruction by the end of the day.

08:24.160 --> 08:24.960
You listen to me.

08:24.960 --> 08:31.120
Thundersnow had a bad buck coming out the paddock, and I was sure, I was almost certain.

08:31.120 --> 08:35.360
But no, he said, put that fucking gun away, Jeremy.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.880
Not to me, I'm Thundersnow.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.360
I'm too proud, and so I think he's okay.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.400
Scary moment, though.

08:40.400 --> 08:46.480
You see a horse take a bad break out the paddock, and you think, like, is this it for our hero Thundersnow?

08:47.520 --> 08:54.480
One of the horses was named after an issue we've had while recording the show before, and it's called J-Boy's Echo.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.960
Sometimes J-Boy does get a little bit of echo from the headphones.

08:58.960 --> 09:04.240
J-Boy's Echo has been an issue that we've had to negate with some audio VST plug-in.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.640
There's another horse here named after another issue that we have on the show, and it's called I-Rap.

09:08.640 --> 09:13.840
And my name is Griffin, and I'm here to say that I love these horses in a major way.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.320
I wish there could just be a 20-way tie.

09:16.320 --> 09:21.280
I wish all these horses could finish at the same time, and they could all just bust all their nuts that night.

09:21.280 --> 09:27.440
I will say, Griffin, when I first saw that the derby hit occurred, the headline I read was,

09:27.440 --> 09:30.880
Always Dreaming Takes First on a Sloppy Track.

09:30.880 --> 09:38.160
They said Always Dreaming in the headline because they can't, like, our fucking, our news, quote-unquote,

09:38.160 --> 09:42.240
papers, that's, one doesn't get quotes because it is on paper.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.600
They're too fucking chicken shit to say Cream Dream in a headline.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.880
They're too chicken shit to put that on the-

09:46.880 --> 09:52.160
Well, they changed the attribute one to Always Creaming, because now he just gets to bust nuts, lips, and rights.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.400
It's good work if you can get it.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.960
Ah, ha-chi-chi-chi.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.920
Sex.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.600
Uh, so anyway, derby, it's got horses, we gotta talk about it.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.560
That's the law.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.960
Let's, but, but that's not all we do here on the show.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.320
We help people, and we give them advice to help them.

10:10.320 --> 10:17.520
And I'd like to do that right now with our first question, and, uh, here we go.

10:17.520 --> 10:22.320
At dinner with my in-laws the other night, I found out about a vacation package they had purchased off the internet,

10:22.320 --> 10:25.600
and were inviting myself and my SO to join them on.

10:25.600 --> 10:30.320
A simple Google search led me to find the package was likely a scam,

10:30.320 --> 10:34.320
and that the company behind it had a long list of scam complaints in the past.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.200
Oof.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.360
My question, though, is what's the best way to tell a friend or loved one that they have been scammed

10:39.360 --> 10:42.960
without making them feel stupid or angry or ruining their vacation?

10:42.960 --> 10:48.880
I feel guilty for not telling them, but also don't want them to go on their vacation and let them get scammed anyway.

10:48.880 --> 10:52.800
That's from scammed by scoundrels and scoundrels in Sydney.

10:52.800 --> 10:58.560
Unless I missed a factor here, I don't think they're gonna go on said vacation.

10:58.560 --> 11:07.120
Unless it's a weird scam I'm not aware of where the person both gets scammed but also gets to go to Hawaii.

11:07.120 --> 11:12.800
It's nice. One of these where they send you a picture of a boat, and they're like 10,000 bucks,

11:12.800 --> 11:18.400
and we'll take you on the cruise of your life, and you show up, and it's just a big picture of a boat.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.200
And Captain Ron is there, but like...

11:21.200 --> 11:25.440
Captain Ron's there, but he's there to just like take some pictures with you with this good boat picture,

11:25.440 --> 11:28.400
and he says, yeah, I hope it was worth it.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.520
And it kind of is.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.360
It kind of is. He's great.

11:31.360 --> 11:35.760
This is... I mean, you got to say something. You don't want them showing up and getting...

11:35.760 --> 11:38.880
Well, but think about it this way. How do you say to them, like,

11:38.880 --> 11:44.240
without sounding like you're saying, hey, stupids, I looked this up. Why didn't you look this up?

11:44.240 --> 11:48.560
This is a scam. It took me five seconds to figure out, even if that's not your tone of voice,

11:48.560 --> 11:53.200
which, God help me, it should not. But like, there's no way to say like, hey,

11:54.880 --> 11:58.160
a brief Google search let me know that y'all been taken.

11:59.520 --> 12:04.320
Well, I think that's probably better than, well, we'll be taking your house now. Goodbye.

12:04.320 --> 12:08.480
Like, I think that they would prefer to hear from you about the scam

12:08.480 --> 12:13.600
rather than, like, you don't own your home anymore. I think they would prefer that, right?

12:13.600 --> 12:21.440
Ooh, what about... Do you have a certain set of skills that will help you to save your in-laws

12:21.440 --> 12:26.720
from the scam taken for? Taken... It's a very low stakes taken.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.160
Yes. You didn't even... How did you even

12:30.160 --> 12:35.920
get here without Googling it accidentally? Cooltrips.biz. Sounds good to me. 800,000?

12:36.560 --> 12:41.520
Here you go. I'll take out a second mortgage. Here you go. Where are we going? That's not important.

12:41.520 --> 12:46.800
Don't worry about it. It says, fun trip for four. Good for me. Where to? Not important.

12:46.800 --> 12:51.680
Amazing Write style, baby. Cue it up, Phil. Cue it up, Phil Keegan. Let's do this shit.

12:52.800 --> 12:57.200
When I worked at Best Buy and we would like ask people if they wanted to sign up for credit

12:57.200 --> 13:02.960
cards and stuff for the story, like, part of it was we needed your social security number.

13:02.960 --> 13:09.120
And there is a certain generation, I'm not going to say 100% in time, but that is more statistically

13:09.120 --> 13:17.200
likely to both be very wary of people in uniforms at a store they're standing in asking for their

13:17.200 --> 13:24.560
social security number, who will also give away whatever information you want for a trip to the

13:24.560 --> 13:26.560
Bahamas or a boat or whatever. Yeah.

13:27.600 --> 13:33.120
I don't know what the disc... But like, hi, you see my face. I'm standing behind a Best Buy desk.

13:33.120 --> 13:38.160
Can I have your... No, no, no. I don't trust that. Okay. Ooh, a flashing window popped up on my

13:38.160 --> 13:42.720
computer. Don't mind if I do. Now, I'll punch the fuck out of this monkey. Wait, you're going to

13:42.720 --> 13:47.840
give me a cruise too? Oh, shit. Just for punching the monkey? Fuck yeah. Just punched the monkey

13:47.840 --> 13:54.320
once? Internet's great. I hate to do this, guys, but at this point, I'm going to have to bring it

13:54.320 --> 14:04.000
up. The grifter's code. Now, here's the problem. Ah, shit. If you are running... If you here tell

14:04.000 --> 14:08.480
about a grift and it sets off your alarm bells, and if you've been in the game for a while,

14:08.480 --> 14:17.040
you know them all. The back alley preacher, the... The Corvin. The Corvin, the seven watches.

14:17.040 --> 14:22.720
The sloppy boy. The creamy... The thunder snow. The bubblegum violin. You know all of the grifts.

14:22.720 --> 14:30.080
The Arkansas creamy dream. I think if you detect a grift and then you alert the grift,

14:30.080 --> 14:36.400
you have got to be prepared for the next time you're running a grift. Call full circle. Oh,

14:36.400 --> 14:40.640
they're coming for you. Big wheel keeps spinning. In a major way. Keep spinning that big wheel.

14:41.520 --> 14:46.960
Ooh. Yeah. What if you... Oh, no. I'm trying to think of the name of the show. What's the show?

14:46.960 --> 14:54.720
Is it collateral? No. Collaboral. That's it. Where you grift the grifter. Oh, shit. It's

14:54.720 --> 15:02.400
collateral. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You reverse grift. Yeah. You need a... You need a captain for your

15:02.400 --> 15:09.760
boat? Yeah, I guess so. How much money? $20,000. Are you a very good captain? You know it. You

15:09.760 --> 15:12.960
know I'm the best captain. Best in the biz. You're not going to find a captain for cheaper

15:12.960 --> 15:17.200
than the exact amount of money my in-laws... I mean, someone's in... I mean, those two

15:17.200 --> 15:24.960
marks gave you. It's a little bit of lingo. The show is Leverage. I'm very mad at myself

15:24.960 --> 15:30.320
that I couldn't pull Leverage. I love that show. I know for a fact the creator of Leverage has

15:30.320 --> 15:34.560
listened to our products before, and I'm very sorry we couldn't pull the name of Leverage.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.080
Sorry we called your show Collaboral. It's definitely not that.

15:38.080 --> 15:50.800
Um, it's just... Oh my goodness. Is it Derby time? I want a mod squad! I thought we were doing

15:50.800 --> 16:03.840
other stuff. I want two mods squad. Bunch of people sent this one in, and I am really excited

16:03.840 --> 16:09.360
about it, and I think that if you've been paying... A lot more people are paying attention to the

16:09.360 --> 16:15.200
scene than they were before. Quick question. Is it these horrible triangles?

16:16.800 --> 16:27.920
The horrible triangles sound pretty tasty right now. I have a side path real quick. KFC has a

16:27.920 --> 16:33.680
romance novel from Mother's Day called Tender Wings of Desire. Very funny. You're definitely

16:33.680 --> 16:39.360
going to want to pick that one up. Literal? Wait. The sentence I said is true, parse it later.

16:39.360 --> 16:50.640
Moving on, naked chicken is back! Naked chicken has become a brand of the Taco Bell hive mind,

16:50.640 --> 16:55.600
and the only odd thing about that is the name was incepted for the naked chicken chalupa,

16:55.600 --> 17:02.080
which of course was chicken instead of a shell, so the naked thing made sense.

17:02.800 --> 17:10.160
But now they're twisting it a little bit with naked chicken chips. It's like all three of

17:10.160 --> 17:19.840
those fucking words. You've modified it. Go on. I'm so excited because I have... Which has become

17:19.840 --> 17:24.080
a rarity. A lot of these companies are not putting out these press releases anymore. I think they

17:24.080 --> 17:30.720
onto me. That's fine. But this one does have a big release. I'm really excited because this is

17:30.720 --> 17:37.440
May 11th this is happening. My big release do you mean diarrhea? Here's the first slide of this

17:37.440 --> 17:43.840
press release. Taco Bell went and did it again. Yes! I agree! That sentence should be preceded by

17:43.840 --> 17:52.240
uh oh. Taco Bell went and did it again. First, they created a taco shell made entirely of crispy

17:52.240 --> 17:57.680
marinated white meat chicken. Now they've done the same with chips complete with here's an adjective

17:57.680 --> 18:04.640
you never knew existed and now wish you could put it away. Dippable nacho cheese sauce. Dippable

18:04.640 --> 18:14.560
nacho cheese. Consider the inverse. Undippable nacho cheese sauce. Unpenetratable. It's straight

18:14.560 --> 18:19.360
cheesy oobleck. It fucking like as much force as you can put into this thing it's gonna push

18:19.360 --> 18:28.080
right the fuck back. Now with unfathomable nacho cheese. Just try to plumb the depths of this nacho

18:28.080 --> 18:33.600
cheese. I'd like to welcome back to the show uh a woman I've come to think of as the fourth

18:33.600 --> 18:39.600
McElroy brother Marissa Thalberg chief marketing officer at Taco Bell uh who says quote the

18:41.680 --> 18:46.320
the world wasn't ready to say goodbye to naked chicken and neither were we.

18:46.320 --> 18:53.520
Thank you Marissa Thalberg for interrupting my grieving process. The world's grieving and you've

18:53.520 --> 18:58.560
you've righted the ship just when you thought it couldn't get any better. That word doesn't mean

18:58.560 --> 19:04.560
what I think it means anymore. We went and added our famous nacho cheese to expose the traditional

19:04.560 --> 19:11.040
chips and cheese combo like only Taco Bell can. The word is expose that Marissa has chosen this

19:11.040 --> 19:16.960
time we're exposing chips and cheese to this fucking radioactive concept of naked chicken.

19:16.960 --> 19:25.920
These are I'm sorry triangular chicken wedges right these are these are nuggets of a sort that

19:25.920 --> 19:33.600
are maybe it sounds like maybe breaded embarrassed with Dorito fixins and you just dip them in nacho.

19:33.600 --> 19:40.640
So these are chicken tenders that are triangular and no I don't want to get it I think to me

19:41.280 --> 19:46.800
I I'm not interested in talking about like fucking BuzzFeed runs a post saying like a hot dog's a

19:46.800 --> 19:51.280
sandwich and then everybody just gets really angry about it for a long time. I don't want to get into

19:51.280 --> 19:56.240
that sort of semantic argument. These are chicken tenders and no making something triangle shape

19:56.240 --> 20:01.840
does not make it a chip. That is the most wack shit I've ever heard. There's only one way in which

20:01.840 --> 20:06.240
it is a chip Griffin and that is literally if they just took like fried chicken skin

20:07.280 --> 20:16.720
and there's no meat whatsoever. I'm gonna I'm gonna yards now. There's um part of this press

20:16.720 --> 20:22.160
release which I'm not gonna get in the prices let me say these chips are extremely affordable

20:22.160 --> 20:27.600
in the monetary sense. I need I need to know the prices I'm sorry. Six piece for $1.99 or 12 piece

20:27.600 --> 20:34.640
for $3.99. That's not getting a deal if you get 12. Um sorry. Um one of those things especially is

20:34.640 --> 20:40.480
that uh is this paragraph. Naked chicken isn't the only thing that's back. The council for eating

20:40.480 --> 20:45.600
fried chicken the same way you always have. A group dedicated to the preservation of traditional

20:45.600 --> 20:49.760
chicken values. The first surface during the launch of the naked chicken chalupa have already

20:49.760 --> 20:55.120
begun their marketing campaign against naked chicken chips. What is this? Which they deem equally as

20:55.120 --> 21:01.920
bold and dangerously delicious. This is of course a fake thing that Taco Bell yeah yeah yeah yeah

21:01.920 --> 21:08.560
it's a fake thing that Taco Bell made up of like people who are a fake group who's like thinks that

21:08.560 --> 21:14.160
this is the road to hell is paved with fried chicken in different shapes. I which is of course

21:14.160 --> 21:19.920
a joke and it's it's marketing and whatever but I do think it reveals something of the Taco Bell

21:19.920 --> 21:27.520
psyche that like on some level they know they have to create their own Moriarty. Like they do

21:27.520 --> 21:33.440
like no one's stopping us and the guilt that we feel is actually manifested in us creating an

21:34.160 --> 21:41.040
anti-Taco Bell. Like we're paying money for an anti-Taco Bell to nip at our heels at every turn.

21:42.480 --> 21:48.320
This is so that when we do things like this and we talk about it that they can be like well yeah

21:48.320 --> 21:54.080
of course they're part of the council and then everybody can just discount our statements.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.760
They could have saved a lot of money by bringing me in to be the counter Taco Bell and be like

21:57.760 --> 22:02.080
Griffin McElroy in the press was like Griffin McElroy of my brother my brother and me in 30

22:02.080 --> 22:07.440
under 30 media luminary said this sounds fucking nasty and I don't know why Taco Bell you think

22:07.440 --> 22:14.400
you are going to become my my number one chicken source. You all don't know fucking anything about

22:14.400 --> 22:19.520
this chicken game and to be honest if this is the heat you're bringing dippable nacho cheese sauce

22:19.520 --> 22:25.040
with little triangles that have probably been a flavor of over blasted with whatever seasoning

22:25.040 --> 22:31.040
you're bringing to the table. I think it sounds pretty nasty Griffin said. Hey fuck that guy come

22:31.040 --> 22:36.960
come get these little guys. Can I actually like I know that you made up the council for eating fried

22:36.960 --> 22:42.720
chicken the same way you always have as a joke but like can I join that? Can I donate lots of

22:42.720 --> 22:47.760
money to the can I give like 10 percent of my paycheck to the good chicken council? Yeah can

22:47.760 --> 22:54.160
we just do that is there are there groups like I always thought family values groups were horseshit

22:54.160 --> 23:00.160
growing up and broadly speaking yes yes they are absolutely yes obviously but if there are groups

23:00.160 --> 23:06.880
devoted to the values of eating chicken in not fun shapes like I would probably join up I would

23:06.880 --> 23:13.280
probably get on board with that if it was a feasible organization. Do you all want to Yahoo?

23:14.000 --> 23:18.640
Yes yeah yeah I do Griffin and while you're doing that I'm going to run a quick who is on this

23:18.640 --> 23:23.280
chicken council try to figure out oh shit who is who's bankrolling the whole thing.

23:23.280 --> 23:31.920
Fucking WikiLeaks over here getting at it getting at the code. Yeah this one was sent in by Tristan

23:31.920 --> 23:37.760
Hyatt thank you Tristan it's Yahoo Answers user anonymous we're gonna call him Reggie asks

23:38.720 --> 23:46.880
weird question how do you shop at Foot Locker? Yeah I've never understood it. Where do they

23:46.880 --> 23:52.080
keep the actual shoes? Do you have to talk to an employee? I hope this question doesn't seem dumb

23:52.080 --> 23:57.920
lol I've kind of been in one for like two minutes felt out of place I saw a few boxes but I just

23:57.920 --> 24:06.560
left after that. This is this is a this is a valuable service because I there have been lots

24:06.560 --> 24:12.080
of times. Juice you remember when it was Trav's and yours birthdays coming up and we wanted to

24:12.080 --> 24:19.200
get him a present and so we went to the vitamin store to buy him some vitamins and we got said

24:19.200 --> 24:24.080
we got said get out of here they said you don't have any money or more or less this is not a

24:24.080 --> 24:28.160
jokey joke somebody said this is a store where all the things are pretty expensive and Justin

24:28.160 --> 24:33.360
you had that Olive Garden money and you were like oh yeah guess you don't want these OG bucks

24:33.360 --> 24:36.720
and then we left the store and we felt like really huffy and superior for the rest of the day. You

24:36.720 --> 24:42.000
just made a big mistake huge. Huge mistake I was gonna buy all the protein for my brother as a

24:42.000 --> 24:46.880
birthday gift. What did you end up getting me just the walk down memory lane do y'all remember or?

24:47.520 --> 24:52.640
No but I mean okay you know how you're all like fucking scrawny and shriveled up now like these

24:52.640 --> 24:57.520
days. That is my defining feature how tiny I am. You're all fucking tiny and wispy and weak and

24:57.520 --> 25:01.760
it's because we weren't able to buy you these pills that you needed to get yoked but anyway.

25:01.760 --> 25:06.560
Ah man two paths diverged you know what I mean? And you took the one. Ah sliding doors. You took

25:06.560 --> 25:11.520
the one of just like a little tiny like a baby's body but anyway how do you shop a full-on like

25:11.520 --> 25:17.520
a welcome to Weinerville body. Like a Weinerville situation. I just think that there's lots of

25:17.520 --> 25:21.600
discomfort about going into certain stores to shop. I feel it when I go into J Crew because

25:21.600 --> 25:26.720
it's a one echelon level higher than the clothes store that I usually shop at and I feel like I'm

25:26.720 --> 25:30.960
gonna embarrass myself in there and obviously this person's struggling at Foot Locker so I think we

25:30.960 --> 25:36.720
could do a little Prima strategy guide a little game facts for Foot Locker. What I find interesting

25:36.720 --> 25:41.440
about this question Griffin is that Reggie's concern is like the actual mechanics. Yeah.

25:41.440 --> 25:46.560
Whereas my my embarrassment when I walk into Foot Locker is like I don't know how to ask where like

25:46.560 --> 25:51.600
the shoes for sitting around and not playing sports are. They got them they got them they got

25:51.600 --> 25:56.160
all kinds of they got fashion they got casual they got all kinds of stuff. I'm just so afraid to ask

25:56.160 --> 26:01.760
because I'm afraid I'll walk in and they'll be like you don't sport and I'll just run out crying.

26:01.760 --> 26:07.280
No no no no that's a common misconception this is page one of the strategy guide it's just like

26:07.280 --> 26:10.800
be confident I think when you walk in there like it doesn't matter what you need these shoes for

26:10.800 --> 26:18.400
Foot Locker's gotcha. Now Griffin they are also dressed I believe the sporting term is referees.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.760
So it's just number two in the like page two in the strategy guide like don't be they're not

26:21.760 --> 26:26.880
gonna call some sort of foul on you can you imagine? Okay that's that's what I was worried

26:26.880 --> 26:31.360
about that I come in and I'd be like um I don't know my size and they're like that's a red card

26:31.360 --> 26:36.320
you're out of here. Yeah yeah that's a sports thing. Um Juice are you still counter programming

26:36.320 --> 26:42.320
the Taco Bell website or are you in the bit with us? No I'm here in the bit I just I I just don't

26:42.320 --> 26:47.040
have much to add about the last time I was in a Foot Locker they had some shoes in glass cases.

26:47.040 --> 26:51.120
Okay. That's not a joke and you could like read about them. So like number three is like don't

26:51.120 --> 26:54.880
get freaked out when you see that like I'd be afraid if I saw that that I was going to

26:54.880 --> 26:59.360
accidentally steal some shoes from Foot Locker and it's like just don't you know it's not a museum

26:59.360 --> 27:02.880
you're not robbing it. Sometimes you have to say that to people like when they're shopping in a

27:02.880 --> 27:06.800
store like sometimes I walk into Best Buy and I think like I hope I don't actually steal some I

27:06.800 --> 27:09.680
you know I don't want to be I don't want to accidentally steal something here.

27:10.480 --> 27:13.600
Yeah you want to on purpose steal things. Well I want to make the decision yeah.

27:14.160 --> 27:20.560
Yeah no Travis knows how hard the LP is at Best Buy they've got eyes on everybody I wouldn't try

27:20.560 --> 27:24.240
to sneak out of that place with anything. Yeah like I like if I was shoplifting from Best Buy

27:24.240 --> 27:31.440
and I saw Travis's little Wienerville baby body I'd be like oh no. That's fair. Um just looks like

27:31.440 --> 27:38.560
five five broomsticks. It is easy though to steal shoes from the Foot Locker because all you do is

27:38.560 --> 27:43.440
you go into the changing room and then you put on the new shoes and you put your old shoes back

27:43.440 --> 27:47.120
in the box and then you say like I you know I decided I don't want these and you just walk out.

27:47.120 --> 27:51.280
Jesus Travis this is a strategy guide for how to shop at Foot Locker and you just told people

27:52.480 --> 27:56.160
go for it basically. I think it's safe though because I don't actually think they have changing

27:56.160 --> 28:02.480
rooms to change your shoes so you I might have given some bogus advice there. Griffin let me

28:02.480 --> 28:06.320
ask you a different question for the strategy guide. How do you shop at Foot Locker? Well I've

28:06.320 --> 28:13.040
been in the Foot Locker and I've seen basketball hoops. Oh yeah. Like is there any risk of a game

28:13.040 --> 28:17.840
breaking out that I would have to participate in? Um I mean it would be pretty loud like the sound

28:17.840 --> 28:21.840
of a basketball being dribbled is like pretty loud so like you wouldn't you I think you'd have

28:21.840 --> 28:24.960
enough time to probably get out of the store but again take those shoes off you don't want to

28:24.960 --> 28:31.200
um thief from them. How do you get the shoes that are right for you at Foot Locker though?

28:32.800 --> 28:38.240
Because like what's a good fit I think for like a Reebok? Well that I actually do know the answer

28:38.240 --> 28:44.720
to Griffin because here's the thing the only people who work at Foot Locker are passionate

28:44.720 --> 28:51.120
about shoe sales. They love it. So if you go up to any one of them and say I don't even know what

28:51.120 --> 28:57.440
I'm looking for I am a blank canvas upon which you can paint your masterpiece they are going to

28:58.160 --> 29:04.160
love the opportunity to really stretch their imaginations and their creativity to find the

29:04.160 --> 29:10.000
right shoe for you. They'll take care of everything you just have a seat and no matter what questions

29:10.000 --> 29:15.760
they ask you say surprise me. And I think that's probably the best way to buy don't even tell them

29:15.760 --> 29:20.640
your shoe size let them figure that out because that's going to make their whole day. Now Juice

29:20.640 --> 29:25.600
I've got a question here from somebody about Foot Locker and I was hoping you could help

29:25.600 --> 29:35.520
them answer it and it's an anonymous ask.fm and they said that they always have stinky feet

29:36.960 --> 29:44.240
and so like they don't want to offend any of the umpires or whatever and so they just asked they

29:44.240 --> 29:50.480
said Justin what do I do about that? Just measure yourself ask if they have a booklet about how to

29:50.480 --> 29:54.800
work that little slide thing okay and then just sit there for a half hour and piece it together

29:54.800 --> 29:59.120
yourself. That's going to take a while though I mean it's it will I don't want to make a day of it

29:59.840 --> 30:04.320
they'll give they'll bring you a cold drink if it takes too long to figure out your shoe size. Do

30:04.320 --> 30:08.160
you think you need you need to pack your lunch yourself though? Yeah do pack a lunch. Does

30:08.160 --> 30:13.280
anybody own those at home and they come in and like put your foot in the scale and then you

30:13.280 --> 30:17.760
could say to them like don't worry about it I used my foot scale at home and I'll tell you exactly

30:17.760 --> 30:23.520
the size it is. Do you think they're on Amazon because like the problem boys is you're dealing

30:23.520 --> 30:29.680
with like a cubit situation where the scale at Payless is different from the scale every store

30:29.680 --> 30:36.320
has their own shoe sizes. Well that's how they and that's how they fuck you right? Yeah um I can't

30:36.320 --> 30:41.600
understand sort of where this person was coming from because if you go there and you just see one

30:41.600 --> 30:46.320
shoe on a shelf you certainly are gonna wonder like well what do I do about that? There's no

30:46.320 --> 30:51.760
I well I mean I'm what so wait is there another one behind if I take one out will another one

30:51.760 --> 30:56.800
just slide into its place like a cook machine? Like no it's that's obviously the most popular

30:56.800 --> 31:01.920
fashionable shoe that everybody's wearing and you fucking buy that shoe and you shut up about it

31:01.920 --> 31:05.440
because you don't know that much about shoes obviously if you're having this much trouble with

31:05.440 --> 31:10.640
it you just got to trust the people at Foot Locker because this is their passion. Now Griffin what

31:10.640 --> 31:16.640
if the shoe is just way too big for you but it is the last one of the most popular shoe? Jam it in

31:16.640 --> 31:24.480
jam it up like maybe put some like rolled up socks in there or or toilet paper or tissue paper or

31:26.560 --> 31:29.920
do they make you get rid of your off-court buddies in that circumstance or

31:31.120 --> 31:33.840
I mean they make you trade in your shoes if you buy shoes at Foot Locker no matter

31:34.560 --> 31:37.520
what you knew that right that's how they get that's how they get new ones

31:37.520 --> 31:43.840
the the the foot measuring thing is called the Brannock device fuck yeah that's awesome it's

31:43.840 --> 31:50.320
awesome it's really cool uh you can buy one on Amazon for $65 that's way more money than I would

31:50.320 --> 31:56.320
ever as a joke spend on anything okay yeah you can but I'm trying to figure out why yeah like

31:57.680 --> 32:04.400
if you were gonna start a shoe place is this the last thing like we are about to open the doors

32:04.400 --> 32:10.720
you're like oh fuck need you know what tell me they got same day tell me because we gotta get

32:11.600 --> 32:21.600
gotta get it I'm 30 I don't and that still feels just awful it tumbled that word just

32:22.320 --> 32:29.360
diapers out of my mouth um but I do think that my feet are probably done growing huh

32:29.360 --> 32:35.760
uh-huh probably are about to start shrinking I don't think my feet are gonna get any huh

32:35.760 --> 32:41.280
there are 10 there are 10 after 30 they shrink they're 10 now I don't think I'm ever gonna hit

32:41.280 --> 32:50.640
10.5 uh I'm a see I'm like a 10.5 11 I do like it but I'm 12 Travis is a two

32:51.680 --> 32:58.560
I'm a 12 d it's just a broomstick going into a shoe I know because I wear cowboy boots sir

32:58.560 --> 33:05.920
and I wear the shit out of them yeah he's very proud of his boots um hey hey boots aren't cheap

33:07.120 --> 33:10.800
that's what they tell me at least I hear that they're expensive you want a nice pair wouldn't

33:10.800 --> 33:14.640
be funny if I know you're doing the transition but wouldn't be funny if you went to footlocker

33:14.640 --> 33:22.880
and they saw your shoes and they were like what are those I love I love that one because they're

33:22.880 --> 33:30.640
like it's just shoes and it's like fun to like slam people for it I think if I were if I had a

33:30.640 --> 33:37.040
footlocker if I owned a footlocker I would tell my employees whenever somebody came in the store

33:37.040 --> 33:43.360
I would tell them to say well you already have shoes what's your what's your angle what are you

33:43.360 --> 33:47.760
playing at you already got them four who are these four they have to come in here if they want our

33:47.760 --> 33:55.440
shoes no shoes sold unless the person is present you know that but if you came in without shoes

33:55.440 --> 34:00.720
they'd be like they're ready they're ready they're ready to receive we've been waiting for you we saw

34:00.720 --> 34:05.920
you coming they come in and I'd be like what are those oh he doesn't have them you got you've

34:06.560 --> 34:13.120
you've solved my joke I would like a Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium but for shoes it was just

34:13.120 --> 34:18.240
fucking magical but at the end you just end up with shoes I don't know I haven't seen it

34:19.840 --> 34:26.960
it might be about shoes I'll spoil it for you uh Mr. Magorium dies and turns into Stardust I guess

34:28.160 --> 34:34.880
I didn't see it either but I got really into it conceptually so I read the plot summary uh all

34:34.880 --> 34:41.760
right I'm gonna try this again boots are expensive money zone these boots are made for walking to the

34:41.760 --> 34:56.800
money zone there we go that's fine I'm very excited to speak because my brother my brother

34:56.800 --> 35:02.960
me is sponsored by Lyft and I love Lyft for a lot of reasons it's a very versatile service

35:02.960 --> 35:09.360
that I'm a fan of one when I travel if I go somewhere like uh San Francisco Sketch Fest

35:09.360 --> 35:16.160
right I don't want to rent a car boom Lyft is right there super convenient two Teresa and I

35:16.160 --> 35:21.360
share a car if I want to make sure my wife still has access to our car and I just need to like

35:21.360 --> 35:26.880
run to an appointment or something boom Lyft does it bum you out Travis at all that this is a sort

35:26.880 --> 35:30.320
of unrequited love because you tried to be a Lyft driver once and they didn't want you

35:30.880 --> 35:38.080
no that was fair because I did have a number of infractions you want you want standards they

35:38.080 --> 35:43.680
won't let Travis drive to pay him money to talk about their service well they might now I think

35:43.680 --> 35:48.800
a lot of those infractions have probably fallen off of my record Travis tried out for the team

35:48.800 --> 35:56.240
tried out for the Lyft team Lyft said no but we'll find some way to use you you you enthusiastic

35:56.240 --> 36:02.400
young driver they they saw something raw in Travis that they could mold you you're not a driver

36:02.400 --> 36:10.160
you're a speaker and they were right speak for Lyft um I I do honestly god I use Lyft all the

36:10.160 --> 36:16.000
time uh and I I'm a pretty big fan um safety is their number one priority every driver is

36:16.000 --> 36:20.480
fully vetted through a 10 point safety standard including third-party criminal and dmv background

36:20.480 --> 36:25.600
checks how many points you think you made it third trap if you were to guess maybe two honestly

36:27.040 --> 36:31.200
I cleaned my car really good and I had peppermints yeah and that's one and two those are the two

36:31.200 --> 36:35.600
first safety standard points and the third one is like I had an iPhone charge cable

36:36.320 --> 36:40.800
all right well that one's important too they can't have you can't have your maps dying

36:42.160 --> 36:48.080
whoo that was close um nine out of ten Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating

36:48.960 --> 36:52.560
and and they offer a better experience with Lyft you can tip in the app so the happier

36:53.200 --> 36:58.640

37:27.520 --> 37:33.360
brother any any shitty old brother hey can I tell you about pro can I tell about pro flowers

37:33.920 --> 37:38.480
yeah please we got some lovely blooms in well we didn't they weren't even blooming yet that's the

37:38.480 --> 37:43.280
best thing we got these lovely little these plants essentially and then I put the dust in the water

37:43.280 --> 37:47.760
they send you the dust and they say put the dust in the water and you cut some of the flowers and

37:47.760 --> 37:51.840
I feel bad doing that every time like you're supposed to cut their butts off basically I

37:51.840 --> 37:56.400
guess it helps them drink up the dust better but anyway they bloomed and we've had them for a while

37:56.400 --> 38:01.200
now and they're just lovely they're sitting on the kitchen and I just like to sometimes I turn

38:01.200 --> 38:08.080
the tv off and I say babe it's I'm talking to Rachel and her baby and I say babes it's flower

38:08.080 --> 38:15.760
night and we'll just look right at these things for two three four five six seven eight hours at a

38:15.760 --> 38:25.440
time nine hours yesterday I'm thinking of it nine hours yesterday you know in the 30s that's what

38:25.440 --> 38:30.000
I had to pass for entertainment your your grandparents probably stared at flowers well

38:30.000 --> 38:34.800
you would finish your dance marathon and you wanted to just chill out for the night and you're

38:34.800 --> 38:39.440
like I can't dance another marathon dancing your dance marathon and they would open the pool up

38:39.440 --> 38:44.560
under you and you'd fall into it every time that's every dance marathon they don't tell you that

38:44.560 --> 38:47.840
that's every dance marathon you fall in the pool and then you walk home with your future wife and

38:47.840 --> 38:51.600
then you get home and you just stare at some flowers and so somebody would go to turn the radio

38:51.600 --> 38:55.920
on and he would slap their hand away from the dial as hard as you possibly could and you say no because

38:55.920 --> 39:00.640
it would interrupt flower watching but also that would attract uh the bombers they would know where

39:00.640 --> 39:05.840
you are because of the radio signal but again to keep that turned off it's flower night mama may

39:05.840 --> 39:12.000
I be excused from the table to go stir the flowers well jeff rooms did you finish your turkey leather

39:12.000 --> 39:17.360

41:11.360 --> 41:16.960
birthing my brothers and me love your jelly i see you didn't want to take the director's note at the

41:16.960 --> 41:22.480
beginning of this one juice i'm not a fucking dancing it says if snowden could come out of

41:22.480 --> 41:26.720
hiding to read this message that'd be great and like i don't know why you want him to compromise

41:26.720 --> 41:37.760
himself for for for you give us one justin just one word thank you for birthing me mother it's

41:37.760 --> 41:43.440
our secret i feel like maybe you've lost much like still fucking there much like the american

41:43.440 --> 41:48.320
intelligence community you've lost snowden maybe a little bit he just sounds smaller

41:49.360 --> 41:54.720
i hate see i hate this happening inorganic you can do it i'm an or this is i'm an organic

41:54.720 --> 42:01.360
comedian yeah i did it it was so funny people are walling their brains off right now they're

42:01.360 --> 42:09.760
loving it just like the kids say snowden fever is back and it's sweeping america and there's

42:09.760 --> 42:14.960
a reason i sometimes you retire a beloved character because you lose touch with them

42:14.960 --> 42:20.960
it's like if um you know the guy who hosts uh all american actor sit down james spader

42:20.960 --> 42:27.120
if he were to say to me justin can i speak with edward snowden the worst thing that's ever

42:27.120 --> 42:30.400
happening by the way is watching james lefton hosted inside of the actor's studio with the

42:30.400 --> 42:36.160
cast of simpsons and uh asking each one in turn if he could speak to their character

42:36.160 --> 42:43.920
and having them improvise some like simpson's back and forth uh uh uh impromptu discussions

42:43.920 --> 42:48.640
with the simpson's family and just one of them look at them like it's scripted james

42:48.640 --> 42:54.480
james show is scripted hey james can i can i speak to mo man

42:57.440 --> 43:03.520

for a moment give me like five minutes that's way i'm not gonna fucking wait way too long to go

44:18.880 --> 44:24.560
without jokes okay two minutes one minute okay one minute it's probably really hard uh for nate to

44:24.560 --> 44:29.840
plan whether bailey's gonna be in dc or the ukraine when this message is read considering it is a

44:29.840 --> 44:35.280
month oh no two months late that's not really a good i don't know if that's a good joke for them

44:35.280 --> 44:39.840

45:18.240 --> 45:23.440
of our classic my brother my brother me goof adjacent segments where you think there's

45:23.440 --> 45:30.080
something funny in it and then you dig around and there's not but then you're three minutes closer

45:30.080 --> 45:35.840
to the podcast being over so everybody wins like in a year you remember something funny happening

45:35.840 --> 45:39.600
here but when you go back and re-listen to the episode you can't pinpoint what moment you were

45:39.600 --> 45:45.360
thinking of yeah if you're if you're scrubbing through right now trying to find that great joke

45:45.360 --> 45:50.880
that you heard on this episode it was earlier or later because it's not in this segment you can

45:50.880 --> 45:55.440

46:34.880 --> 46:39.040
a riddle master but i needed a little bit more time than this phone i'm giving this phone three

46:39.040 --> 46:43.040
stars out of five because it doesn't give you enough time to the bezel is like almost not there

46:43.040 --> 46:47.760

46:47.760 --> 46:51.520
give you enough time to solve them three stars out of five sorry google i had to dock you two

46:51.520 --> 46:59.120

47:03.280 --> 47:11.760

money zone spot yeah it's almost like i'm trying to move on the next thing and you keep talking

47:27.840 --> 47:37.920
about your phone hey max fun fans it's maximum fun org founder jesse thorn i just wanted to take a

47:37.920 --> 47:44.880
minute to congratulate our colleague ben partridge he's the host and creator of the beef and dairy

47:44.880 --> 47:52.320

48:06.000 --> 48:12.160
a perfect podcast uh so congratulations ben partridge and congratulations to everyone

48:12.160 --> 48:18.880
who's contributed to the beef and dairy network podcast we're proud of you do you think living on

48:18.880 --> 48:24.240
a houseboat would be as fun as it sounds that's from landlocked in illinois there's not explicit

48:24.240 --> 48:30.400
advice i guess in this one it's more implicit advice i suppose um pros and cons pros you can

48:30.400 --> 48:34.560
fish right off the side of the damn thing no problem but you know me i fish i love fishing

48:34.560 --> 48:41.760
every morning sometimes it's a hassle to get down to the ocean oh also you have the 360 surround

48:41.760 --> 48:49.440
pool who else can claim that on their house i mean i guess other people in houseboats um negatives

48:49.440 --> 48:54.800
you could wake up drowned which is kind of a bad one like that actually no matter what like

48:54.800 --> 49:00.000
you're mobile you could live wherever you want your house moves fishing off the side 360 pool

49:00.000 --> 49:06.560
is all super good i'm sure it's very scenic but you could wake up drowned and that's that might

49:06.560 --> 49:13.040
actually sort of outweigh the like i'm in my ranch style home here in texas that's a very low chance

49:13.040 --> 49:20.960
of it happening because it's not an aqua vehicle uh i mean if i if my regular house breaks i call

49:20.960 --> 49:29.920
a guy if my houseboat breaks i'm all of a sudden in like a desperate adventure movie situation like

49:29.920 --> 49:34.800
i'm i'm fighting for my life all of a sudden which maybe is not what you want to do when you're

49:34.800 --> 49:39.360
trying to just catch up on you know 24 or whatever you're doing at your home and before you say before

49:39.360 --> 49:45.520
you say it doesn't happen it happened to a bar in huntington so yes that is true but the question

49:45.520 --> 49:52.480
boys was not is it as responsible as it sounds the question was is it as fun as it sounds so

49:52.480 --> 49:56.640
you think it'd be pretty fun for your house to break and then you almost drown while you're

49:56.640 --> 50:01.600
trying to swim out of your home like oh i look at that roller coaster and something bad could happen

50:01.600 --> 50:05.360
so i'm not gonna get on that roller coaster doesn't mean the roller coaster is not fun

50:05.360 --> 50:10.800
it just means that you're being a little too responsible i think living on a houseboat would

50:10.800 --> 50:19.520
be as fun as it sounds right up until the moment when it sinks up until then you're right travis

50:19.520 --> 50:24.880
you shouldn't think about don't don't don't cry because it's over laugh because of the great

50:24.880 --> 50:29.680
memories you had along the way thank you because here's the thing no the house i live in now is

50:29.680 --> 50:33.920
most likely not going to sink unless we have a sinkhole situation but you know what else

50:33.920 --> 50:37.920
i also don't get to pretend like i'm on an adventure with my friends huck finn and tom

50:37.920 --> 50:44.160
sawyer every day sure you know what i mean like um can i read a yahoo do you think if you have

50:44.160 --> 50:49.200
a houseboat uh-huh and you see people fishing near your houseboat are you allowed to be like

50:49.200 --> 50:56.160
come on yeah those are my fish those are clearly my fish i've named those i named those they're

50:56.160 --> 51:05.120
my pets that's my coin pond um do you guys want any i who do you think if you own a houseboat

51:05.120 --> 51:13.440
okay claim that like you have lots of outdoor bathrooms what's the square footage well i don't

51:13.440 --> 51:17.920
know how far can you spin it yeah all of it hey here's a good thing about houseboat if you drive

51:17.920 --> 51:23.280
it out far enough you can turn on your video poker machine and just go hog wild that's one

51:23.280 --> 51:33.120
fun thing yeah so send them by zoe kensky riding high this is not a good one i just will i will

51:33.120 --> 51:37.360

51:37.360 --> 51:43.040
in yahoo answers user sorry something's gone wrong i'm gonna call him keith asked riddle

51:43.040 --> 51:48.640
me this batman how can you find out if you were breastfed without asking anyone in your family

51:48.640 --> 51:53.760
and then additional details batman jokes aside how can you find out if you were

51:53.760 --> 52:00.240
breastfed without asking anyone in your family does it say batman jokes aside yes

52:01.280 --> 52:07.760
all right i'm not farting around it'll be a riddle dd batman if you kill him he won't learn

52:07.760 --> 52:12.160
nothing how can you find out if you're breastfed without asking anyone in your family never mind

52:12.160 --> 52:17.840
the batman stuff i just want to know about the breastfeeding i'm glad he got that different

52:17.840 --> 52:21.040
i'm glad he got that distraction otherwise otherwise i would have been listening the

52:21.040 --> 52:26.080
second half of the question wondering when's another batman joke coming what character is

52:26.080 --> 52:33.280
this let's put a smile on that face how could i find his breastfeeding don't think about the

52:33.280 --> 52:39.840
joker thing i want to know if i was breastfed from a breast riddle me this batman does your

52:39.840 --> 52:46.640
shirt have holes in it no what has two hands a face and doesn't move a clock what you said it

52:46.640 --> 52:53.280
way too fast the batman's the riddler i wasn't even i wasn't even done listening and the sound

52:53.280 --> 53:01.200
had not made it to my back ears yet how do you guys think he does put it on what how does batman

53:01.200 --> 53:05.440
put it on i was thinking about it like he would tell the ruler like no no buttons and then the

53:05.440 --> 53:09.200
room would be like then how'd you put it on and then batman would have to say something i guess

53:09.200 --> 53:14.000
he wouldn't he would probably just punch him but like if he wanted to answer how how would he put

53:14.000 --> 53:19.440
it on right why didn't the riddler ever look at batman and say riddle me this who is batman and

53:19.440 --> 53:25.120
batman would be like bruce wayne shit damn he got me and solved it though and i give me 10 riddle

53:25.120 --> 53:30.880
points and when he says up 100 the riddler dies do you think in every batman story you've ever

53:30.880 --> 53:39.200
seen ever they have omitted a 10 second beat of footage where he's just like zip me up alfred

53:39.200 --> 53:47.280
alfred get no too tight corset me up alfred tighten my corset alfred it seems like a like a

53:47.280 --> 53:54.800
rubber spray like he's just sprayed on him sprayed it on human beings removing wetsuits before and

53:54.800 --> 54:02.320
it is not a cool thing or an easy thing it kind of looks like someone shedding their exoskeleton

54:02.320 --> 54:06.160
their carapace and if we're if we're being honest his wiener probably looks super weird in there

54:06.160 --> 54:09.680
super weird in there when you take like it probably looks super super soon it's like a

54:09.680 --> 54:13.840
little hot bag that you sweat into and then when you take it off like we don't talk about this ever

54:13.840 --> 54:19.440
but his wiener probably looks like pretty busted he's definitely fully talc'd up before it gets

54:19.440 --> 54:27.360
in there 360 degrees full coverage he's got like a spray tan booth of talcum powder it's like oh

54:27.360 --> 54:34.480
there's a crime okay i need 20 minutes to get i i just i gotta grease up and then talc up and then

54:34.480 --> 54:39.200
get in the suit and that takes a while and i had to put in a lot of soundproofing so you wouldn't

54:39.200 --> 54:45.360
hear the squeaking and the screaming do you think at some point in the relationship alfred has come

54:45.360 --> 54:54.240
to him and said uh master bruce yes uh i'm just gonna ask a fucking kid please stop peeing in the

54:54.240 --> 55:04.880
suit master bruce i have to fucking wash it okay master bruce please stop peeing in the suit i

55:04.880 --> 55:12.320
have taken the liberty of i've crafted you a flannel number with several zippers and buttons

55:12.320 --> 55:21.120
and flaps no okay but just for a second just consider master bruce who do you think it stinks

55:21.120 --> 55:25.280
like shit there's nothing we're gonna do about that you're getting you're fighting the penguin

55:25.280 --> 55:29.760
you're sweating to high heaven i'll quit and then i'll need a way to make money and i can think of

55:29.760 --> 55:35.280
one pretty fucking good one and it's a book called here's what the bat cave is by me alfred who no

55:35.280 --> 55:41.760
longer watches it's called the secrets of the underground piss boy and that's you that's you

55:42.720 --> 55:48.160
you and chapter one you'll never believe this clammy pingness i'll tell them about the time

55:48.160 --> 55:54.240
you got scared last year remember master bruce really scared remember really really scared i

55:54.240 --> 56:01.120
think of it as alfred's super bad day that he had because of you master bruce you remember when he

56:01.120 --> 56:06.400
hey gotham chapter two remember when bane almost blew our thing up with i forget why but it was

56:06.400 --> 56:18.720
really dumb but anyway batman came home from that one and his balls were so pruney it was the suit

56:18.720 --> 56:27.840
is so tight he was out there for a few days just getting wildly pruney down there chapter three

56:27.840 --> 56:34.160
master bruce stopped watching dexter after season three but he continued to make me recap episodes

56:34.160 --> 56:39.920
after i watched them for the entirety of the series literally half of my day is spent recapping

56:39.920 --> 56:48.880
dexter for batman batman took a weird turn i like it he's a weird dude man uh the other day my

56:48.880 --> 56:52.720
boyfriend went thrift shopping on his day off from work when he got home i asked him if he had found

56:52.720 --> 56:58.000
anything good he said that he had and proceeded to show me a chris angel mind freak magic kit

56:58.000 --> 57:03.760
i really like this guy what do i do get fucking stoked yeah get married i guess to this person as

57:03.760 --> 57:12.480
fast as is possible are you kidding me that's very good was it unopened because you run the risk of

57:12.480 --> 57:18.880
some of the minds having already been freaked yeah you can't unfreeze those beans um can you

57:20.080 --> 57:23.280
sorry just i wanted to do a joke but i didn't want to be rude and interrupt you so maybe you

57:23.280 --> 57:26.560
could read it a second time and i'll be rude this time but it won't be the one that counts

57:27.120 --> 57:31.040
yeah you got it all right um the other day my boyfriend went thrift shopping

57:31.040 --> 57:43.680
i'm gonna pop some tags you said he had a joke i'm still waiting on where's the joke

57:43.680 --> 57:51.120
at one point he says piss in the song yeah that is pretty good but shit it was 99 cents

57:51.120 --> 57:56.400
and he comes back at it and but with a message like an important message um this is the best

57:56.400 --> 58:01.280
pickup like ever and i think you should get psyched and like start like putting on little

58:01.280 --> 58:05.840

58:16.080 --> 58:20.960
