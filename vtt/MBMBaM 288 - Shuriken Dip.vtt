00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:45.920
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother,

00:45.920 --> 00:49.200
me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.360
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm that sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:53.360 --> 00:58.160
Everybody's talking about him. I had an idea, and this is not a thing we normally do,

00:58.160 --> 01:06.000
but I thought that with the big game coming up, we could offer a service to our listeners,

01:06.880 --> 01:13.840
and that is we will provide for them some things to toss into maybe a conversation at a big game

01:13.840 --> 01:19.440
watch party for people who have no idea what's going on and know nothing about football. So say

01:19.440 --> 01:25.040
a loved one has tracked you along, or maybe a brother has insisted that you come to the party

01:25.040 --> 01:29.360
and you're surrounded by football fans and you have no idea what to say. We'll give you

01:30.000 --> 01:35.600
some sentences to sprinkle into the conversation. I tell you one good one, and this is a good catch

01:35.600 --> 01:39.040
all. Just look at any player on the field and then say their name, and then say,

01:39.840 --> 01:42.560
I just disagree with the way that he carries himself off the field.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.720
I like that. Because 80% of the time, you're probably on point.

01:46.720 --> 01:51.360
Yes, or you're just echoing some controversy that probably doesn't exist. When they ask you

01:51.360 --> 01:56.720
to clarify, just be like, I like it when players just do it for the love of the game.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.040
Nice.

01:58.880 --> 02:04.080
Anytime anyone does anything, literally anything, just shake your head and say, too showy.

02:04.080 --> 02:04.480
Yeah.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.520
Too showy, I think. I liked it better when they just did it for the love of the game.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.400
You can also just say, oh, that was clearly defensive pass interference.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.760
Just literally every play, because it usually is most of the time.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.960
Oh, if-

02:20.960 --> 02:22.640
You can also just say DPI.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.640
If Cam fumbles, you can say more like Old Town.

02:24.640 --> 02:25.840
Now, who is that?

02:25.840 --> 02:26.960
Cam Newton.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.680
What is his-

02:27.680 --> 02:30.480
He is the quarterback for the Carolina Panthers.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.480
You could say more like Old Town, and then high five a bunch of people.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.600
Now that he's actually pretty young, and Peyton Manning is the old one.

02:37.600 --> 02:42.640
Yeah, so that one's probably not going to get you many points with your friends.

02:42.640 --> 02:47.600
Let me suggest one. When you first show up and everyone's making chit chat before the game while

02:47.600 --> 02:51.440
they're eating the canapes, you-

02:51.440 --> 02:52.240
The what now?

02:52.240 --> 02:54.400
The canapes that are served pre-game.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.120
Why are we making pre-game chit chat?

02:57.120 --> 02:59.040
I don't know what fucking words you're saying.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.080
Canapes, they're-

03:01.920 --> 03:02.400
I can't-

03:02.400 --> 03:03.920
Tiny party food, come on.

03:03.920 --> 03:10.960
Thank you, Travis. When you're eating canapes in the pre-game ritual, loudly announced to anybody

03:10.960 --> 03:16.720
that'll listen, every year, I only watch for the commercials.

03:16.720 --> 03:21.040
And then the first time someone gets a touchdown, say, that's a commercial.

03:21.040 --> 03:21.760
Nice.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.640
That's a good-

03:22.640 --> 03:23.440
I like that.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.800
Where in this whole time, you thought touchdowns were called commercials.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.680
Yeah, that's fun.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.040
What if you created a fiction where you had like super-

03:32.400 --> 03:38.640
Your whole financial life was riding on how many field goals were kicked in the entire game?

03:39.680 --> 03:41.120
Okay, more field goals. Let's have them.

03:41.120 --> 03:41.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.200
As soon as the first field goal-

03:43.200 --> 03:43.680
The breaks.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.880
The breaks. Upon the completion of the first field goal, just barf right there.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.240
And people are like, what's wrong with you?

03:50.240 --> 03:54.400
And you say, I had 15K, there wouldn't be any field goals the whole game.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.280
No, no, no.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.640
I never bet. I've never bet. This is my first bet in my whole life.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.560
I'll never see my kids after this.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.840
And make it up to me and say, I bet there'll be some field goals.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.360
And you said, bullshit, 15,000 on the table.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.320
I need to go sell my kidney.

04:12.320 --> 04:16.960
I bet it's going to be zero, zero at the end of it for a Super Bowl tie.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.200
I put 45,000 on zero, zero.

04:19.200 --> 04:24.560
Can you just have a quiver of things that you can shout whenever everybody else shouts?

04:24.560 --> 04:25.760
Because that's the real secret.

04:25.760 --> 04:29.440
You don't have to like lead the charge in talking about how good the sporting has been so far.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.280
But you do need to participate when other people get super psyched

04:33.280 --> 04:36.480
whenever like a good pass or run is done to completion.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.480
And so just like, whenever you see everybody like stand up or be like,

04:40.480 --> 04:43.760
oh, just be like, slam a jam a ding dong.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.280
Pass the hummus.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.720
Well, no.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.560
Well, that's great because it works on both levels.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.040
You get to participate in the yelling and also you get some of that hummus.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.120
Yeah, pass that fucking hummus, Cam.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.320
And then you also get dip out of that.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.360
You also get the hummus.

04:57.360 --> 05:01.360
Yeah, but you could do what I do every Super Bowl, which is leave the room,

05:01.360 --> 05:04.800
re-enter every 15 minutes and say, how you boys doing on snacks?

05:04.800 --> 05:07.600
And then leave the room again.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.960
Can I freshen up anyone's drink?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.720
Can I freshen up anybody's drinks?

05:10.720 --> 05:12.000
How you boys doing on snacks?

05:12.560 --> 05:13.920
Funyuns running a little low.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.520
Let me top those off.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.880
All right, boys, have fun.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.240
Those are your fucking snacks?

05:18.960 --> 05:19.200
What?

05:19.760 --> 05:20.880
Those are your snacks?

05:20.880 --> 05:22.240
That doesn't seem like a very-

05:22.240 --> 05:23.520
Those are my canapes.

05:24.480 --> 05:24.960
I still don't understand what that word means.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.200
He does Funyuns with like a fried egg on top.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.720
No, okay, I'll be honest.

05:29.760 --> 05:35.520
My go-to for that sort of vignette would have normally been pizza rolls,

05:35.520 --> 05:38.000
but they didn't pay to be on here.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.120
So I'm gonna keep the name out of my mouth.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.560
You gotta pay the canapé.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.920
Gotta pay the canapé.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.760
Sorry, T blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, apostrophe, S.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.400
I think I put too many blanks in there.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.440
I think it was Totino, no, no, no.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.640
I think it was not enough.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.240
What is the halftime show?

05:54.960 --> 05:56.960
I think it is Rihanna.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.760
No, it's, wait, is it Rihanna or is it-

05:59.760 --> 06:01.680
Is Rihanna with the Moody Blues?

06:01.680 --> 06:02.180
No.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.160
All right, is it not?

06:04.160 --> 06:05.600
Is it Coldplay?

06:05.600 --> 06:09.040
I think it's Rihanna and Coldplay,

06:09.040 --> 06:12.240
and that guy that did Don't Believe Me, Just Watch.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.920
And then I think on top of that-

06:13.920 --> 06:14.640
Bruno Mars?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.560
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are gonna come down

06:16.560 --> 06:20.000
and just gently lower their balls onto the halftime show

06:20.000 --> 06:21.440
just to ruin it a little bit.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.800
Wow, it is a big one.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.240
It is Coldplay and Beyonce and Bruno Mars.

06:26.240 --> 06:26.800
You're right.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.080
Oh wow, really?

06:28.080 --> 06:28.320
Yeah.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.000
Bruno Mars like just did it.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.240
Yeah.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.400
He like power lined it up all over the place.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.960
We're reflecting on all the classic moments of Super Bowl halftime shows in the past.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.080
I really get Prince.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.800
Prince is the best halftime show that's ever been.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.520
I think you could-

06:42.320 --> 06:44.160
Do you remember when he had a guitar boner?

06:44.160 --> 06:44.880
Oh god, it was the best.

06:44.880 --> 06:45.680
Which time?

06:45.680 --> 06:47.040
You can't just say that about Prince.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.720
Do you remember when he had a guitar boner?

06:48.720 --> 06:49.520
Are you talking about in like-

06:49.520 --> 06:50.800
His guitar was a penis in 1985.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.000
I guess it's probably better to say,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.840
do you remember when he didn't have a guitar boner?

06:53.840 --> 06:56.640
Can we start with a decade in which that happened?

06:56.640 --> 06:57.440
Here's the thing.

06:57.440 --> 07:04.640
Go in and be absolutely 100% ignorant of sport and all rules of sport.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.880
And then as soon as Coldplay takes the stage,

07:06.880 --> 07:11.200
just start hammering Coldplay trivia and all the Coldplay-

07:11.200 --> 07:14.000
Just like the performance lights come up,

07:14.000 --> 07:15.520
you turn to the person next to you and say,

07:15.520 --> 07:17.840
hey, you know Chris Martin's father is an accountant.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.680
And just wait, just wait, pace it every 15 minutes.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.200
Just try it out like 15 seconds.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.040
Like, hey, did you know their first song is called Ode to Deodorant?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.080
And it was written as a joke.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.120
Hey, can you guys name anybody else in Coldplay other than Chris Martin?

07:33.680 --> 07:34.560
Steve Coldplay.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.880
I don't think he's one of them.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.120
He formed it like in Van Halen.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.680
There's Doug Hotwork, which is weird.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.800
I work hot so I can play cold.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.280
You know, Chris Martin, while he was writing Yellow,

07:47.280 --> 07:49.360
noticed the phone book, the Yellow Pages,

07:49.360 --> 07:52.400
and decided that the word yellow fit nicely in his song.

07:52.960 --> 07:53.840
That's why it's there.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.240
Where are you going?

07:56.240 --> 07:58.080
Please, there's still so much more.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.200
Please sit back down.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.000
Please sit back down.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.960
I have so many more facts.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.920
I thought Doug Hotwork was the creative lead behind Yellow.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.560
Can we create a three person,

08:09.120 --> 08:12.160
just Coldplay slam band called Hotwork?

08:12.160 --> 08:14.080
And just like all of our songs are just like,

08:14.080 --> 08:15.520
get it together Coldplay.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.960
It's all songs about Coldplay?

08:17.520 --> 08:19.040
Yeah, and how bad they stink.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.600
Cause we're Hotwork, the evil Coldplay.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.560
Oh, I see.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.560
We're the Riverbottom Nightmare band.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.960
Yeah, and we'll just like show up to all their shows

08:26.960 --> 08:29.040
and play smaller concerts in the crowd.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.040
And try and just distract.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.480
Amp versus Amp Coldplay.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.320
Bring it on, Christopher Martin.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.360
We're the misfits to their Joe the Holograms.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.240
That's a weird thing to call your cartoon band.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.280
Cause that's a thing.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.880
Cause that was like a real ass band.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.760
For real, yeah.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.760
So that's, let's talk about advice for people.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.040
Yeah, oh, that seems pretty good.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.400
I like to sleep in my blue jeans.

08:54.400 --> 08:54.800
Stop.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.760
Next question.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.440
You don't deserve to have this.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.840
You read, just read the fucking thing.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.440
I'm gonna mute my Skype call for a while.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.440
My fear is that by like, that it's like,

09:10.240 --> 09:12.640
we have influence and by putting these ideas

09:12.640 --> 09:14.800
that are about to be in this email out into the world,

09:14.800 --> 09:16.800
we may influence even a single person

09:17.360 --> 09:19.440
to adopt this monstrous behavior.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.640
Like, I'm not sure I want that in my conscience.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.560
Unless we just tear this person a new person.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.160
A new person.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.760
We tear this person a new person.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.800
Read the fucking question.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.920
To become a different person.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.400
I like to sleep in my blue jeans.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.360
My wife thinks I'm a total monster,

09:35.360 --> 09:37.520
but for me, there's no,

09:37.520 --> 09:39.280
I'm not making this person sound defensive enough.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.160
Hold on, let me try again.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.880
I like to sleep in my blue jeans.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.400
My wife thinks I'm a total monster,

09:46.400 --> 09:48.880
but there's no greater comfort than the feeling of denim

09:48.880 --> 09:49.680
rubbing against my shit.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.160
There's a billion, billion, billion greater comforts.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.960
There's a million, millions of greater comforts.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.680
There is a Sagan of greater comforts.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.360
I work in a cube all day,

09:59.360 --> 10:00.720
so it's not like my jeans are dirty.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.640
Why does the geometric shape in which you do your biz

10:05.360 --> 10:08.640
influence their smell and dirt level?

10:10.240 --> 10:13.600
Sometimes I get a fresh pair from the closet to sleep in.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.480
My sleep jeans.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.920
Please vindicator vilify me,

10:17.920 --> 10:20.480
and that's from stylish slumber in the south.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.080
I have news for this person.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.400
They have taken like cork,

10:24.960 --> 10:26.800
and they dropped a brick on the gas pedal,

10:26.800 --> 10:28.160
they ramped over the ravine,

10:28.160 --> 10:29.680
they pressed the nitrous button,

10:29.680 --> 10:32.400
and they ended up in fetish chasm.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.240
Sorry, this is a fetish.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.120
You do not have a comfort,

10:37.120 --> 10:38.720
like comfort is not the issue

10:38.720 --> 10:40.800
when talking about jeans and sleep.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.480
You have a denim fetish, and that's cool, but own it.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.360
But you gotta own it.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.560
You gotta lean into it.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.920
John Mellencamp had a denim fetish,

10:47.920 --> 10:52.080
and he fucking turned it into a successful musical career.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.480
He rebuilt America's economy with that denim fetish.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.120
He did.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.560
He was the Hamilton of denim.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.440
Okay, question asker.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.960
There are sleep pants.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.800
I'm worried that maybe you didn't know,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.640
and this is the first you're hearing about it.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.320
There are really nice sleep pants from Beyond East.

11:12.320 --> 11:15.280
You can go to Target and get like $10 sleep pants,

11:15.280 --> 11:18.640
and I think maybe you've only ever slept in jeans,

11:18.640 --> 11:23.600
and if you put on even like the shittiest pair of sleep pants,

11:23.600 --> 11:25.040
and you get in bed, you're gonna be like,

11:25.040 --> 11:28.000
oh my God, do other people know about this?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.360
I just like, it's unthinkable.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.080
I can't get my jeans off me fast enough

11:34.080 --> 11:35.760
when the workday's done, and I work from home,

11:35.760 --> 11:37.760
so that's an entirely arbitrary distinction.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.440
Jeans just bend in such weird ways,

11:41.440 --> 11:43.840
like at the knee and everywhere.

11:43.840 --> 11:47.280
Like they just don't, they're not a comfort pant.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.240
They're not, they're like the Chevy,

11:50.240 --> 11:52.720
old-timey Chevy truck of pant.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.320
It's not like a sleek like,

11:54.320 --> 11:55.680
look at me fly around these curves.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.640
It's like, I gotta get a load of lumber to the mill.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.840
That's what jeans are.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.760
Denim was invented so that like cows,

12:03.760 --> 12:07.360
when they bit you, it didn't hurt very bad, or like-

12:07.360 --> 12:10.800
Yeah, that used to be the tagline underneath like Levi's,

12:10.800 --> 12:12.960
so it doesn't hurt so bad when cows bite you.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.320
Or like if you and Stevie are having a pitchfork fight,

12:16.320 --> 12:18.960
you got basically a little bit of armor down there.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.880
I put jeans on, like even on the weekends,

12:22.880 --> 12:24.160
like when we have to do this show,

12:25.600 --> 12:28.560
I put jeans on before we start,

12:28.560 --> 12:31.120
and I take them off immediately afterwards,

12:31.120 --> 12:35.120
but I need them to feel like I'm at work.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.080
Like I need them to feel like I'm not relaxing,

12:38.080 --> 12:39.920
and I need jeans to keep me awake.

12:39.920 --> 12:43.360
I'm like the polar opposite of your jean situation.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.400
Unless-

12:44.400 --> 12:47.920
No, there's no, not, no, I'm drawing a fucking line.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.480
There's no unless, no sleep jeans.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.320
He said unless, I have to say it.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.040
Say it.

12:53.040 --> 12:53.600
Unless.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.040
This guy is a wizard of denim.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.320
No, stop it, that's nothing.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.680
No, hear me out, hear me out.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.440
What if he's found a care regimen for his denim

13:03.440 --> 13:05.440
that if he just revealed it to the world,

13:05.440 --> 13:07.520
would change the jean game forever?

13:07.520 --> 13:10.320
And he's like, oh, do you guys not like soak them

13:10.320 --> 13:13.280
in lard first and then put them in microwave for 30 seconds?

13:13.280 --> 13:14.240
And it's like, what?

13:14.240 --> 13:17.200
And when you do that, it makes them feel like satin.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.560
Then just wear satin.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.720
Guess what, pimp jeans wizard?

13:22.720 --> 13:24.640
I can, I'm one step ahead of the game,

13:24.640 --> 13:26.080
and I save lard money.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.280
I just buy satin.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.280
You gotta save that lard money.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.480
It's expensive.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.560
2016, you gotta send kids to college.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.080
This makes me so angry.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.200
This makes me so angry.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.960
Maybe if you got like, if your pre-bedtime regimen

13:40.960 --> 13:42.640
was just like you did like 20 whippets,

13:42.640 --> 13:44.080
and it was just like you fell into bed

13:44.080 --> 13:46.080
and forgot to take your pants off every night.

13:46.080 --> 13:50.480
That sucks, but I'm willing to give that person more, more-

13:50.480 --> 13:53.360
I would be less irritated by somebody who said,

13:53.360 --> 13:55.120
listen, every night before I need to go to sleep,

13:55.120 --> 13:56.400
I have to do 20 whippets.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.480
And then I just crash into bed

13:58.480 --> 14:00.560
and just like whatever I'm wearing, that's my sleep stuff.

14:00.560 --> 14:06.480
You purposefully, you have jeans specifically for this thing.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.880
There's criminal intent.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.440
Can I tell you one thing that would be really,

14:11.440 --> 14:13.280
really nice though is travel.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.240
For travel, you wouldn't need to pack,

14:16.240 --> 14:19.280
you know, your sleepy time shorts for that.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.520
Hotel lounge, when you get a hotel lounge.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.040
Now, okay, okay, here's a question.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.240
When you got, when the workday is done for y'all

14:26.240 --> 14:28.240
and it's time to like unwind,

14:28.240 --> 14:29.920
maybe make a blue apron and sit down,

14:29.920 --> 14:30.960
watch some television.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.880
Drink some Club W.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.360
Yeah, whatever, whatever one of your-

14:35.360 --> 14:36.640
Eat some Nature Box.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.720
Do your fucking job applications with Ziprecruiter.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.840
Put three dildos up your butt

14:41.840 --> 14:43.520
like you're a toothbrush cup on a sink.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.760
That you bought from Extreme Strengths.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.040
Actually, no, you actually bought them from Squarespace.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.680
Weird twist.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.360
Do you guys like get out of jeans

14:55.360 --> 14:56.960
and get into like something more comfortable?

14:56.960 --> 14:59.360
Like you get some sweatpants going or something?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.160
Justin, I might as well have a Wallace and Gromit machine

15:02.160 --> 15:05.920
that does it for me.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.680
Okay, so this is my question.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.000
Does this person who sleeps in jeans,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.680
do you think that they're spending

15:11.680 --> 15:14.640
the entirety of their evening in jeans?

15:14.640 --> 15:17.360
Or like, does that not spell comfort to them?

15:17.360 --> 15:18.000
Like how do they even want-

15:18.000 --> 15:20.240
Do you mean like maybe they work in sleep pants?

15:20.240 --> 15:21.760
I can't wait to get these off.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.120
Yeah, exactly.

15:23.120 --> 15:26.400
24, 7, 365, it's opposite day.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.480
Let's get silly.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.560
You can't wear sweatpants to the office.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.520
You cannot do it.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.040
You fucking low-rate Alice in Wonderland character.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.360
Like you gotta get the right pants for the right time of day.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.440
I'm the silly pants boy.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.880
Stop, you're not.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.080
You have a fetish.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.400
That's fine, just don't air it out here.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.640
Or do, like this is a good venue for airing out your fetish.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.800
But just say like, I've got a denim fetish.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.400
Don't tell me that it's a sleep thing.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.920
But don't say it now.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.800
You're on the clock at Barnes and Noble.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.960
You can't just go around saying that,

15:58.960 --> 16:00.800
parading it around in front of all of us.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.480
Cause we're jealous.

16:03.440 --> 16:03.920
We are jealous.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.000
Cause we all wish we had something that made us feel

16:06.000 --> 16:08.160
as alive as your jeans make you feel.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.640
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

16:10.640 --> 16:11.120
Please.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.680
Got a bunch of real good ones.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.560
Thank you everybody.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.760
This was sent in by game recognized game Rachel Rosen.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.400
Thank you, Rachel.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

16:19.760 --> 16:20.800
Oops, they're anonymous.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.960
Oops, all berries.

16:22.960 --> 16:28.080
Uh, it was asked by Captain, uh, Captain Munch.

16:28.080 --> 16:28.720
Captain C.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.760
CC asks, am I too powerful?

16:35.440 --> 16:39.840
My mum, me mum, just recently signed me up

16:39.840 --> 16:41.840
for Krav Maga lessons.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.840
My instructor says I'm in,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.240
my instructor says I'm accelerating

16:48.240 --> 16:53.680
at an unimaginable rate.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.880
What I'm trying to say is what if I become a human weapon

16:56.880 --> 16:59.120
and I'm not allowed out in public?

16:59.120 --> 17:00.560
Oh God, I get that, man.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.320
This is that con air fear.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.120
Like you, you accidentally kill a guy in a bar fight

17:05.120 --> 17:07.360
and the judge is like, well, we all know

17:07.360 --> 17:09.280
that he's a Krav Maga weapon

17:09.280 --> 17:11.680
and his hands are deadly weapons

17:11.680 --> 17:13.440
and he shouldn't be allowed in public anymore.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.520
And we got to lock him away in a prison

17:15.520 --> 17:16.880
filled with the worst scum

17:16.880 --> 17:18.320
and then fly him across the country.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.120
But then the plane crashes in the desert, I think.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.560
And Steve Buscemi is there

17:22.560 --> 17:24.000
and he has tea with the little girl.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.520
I don't want to give away the ending,

17:25.520 --> 17:26.640
but you should check out Con Air.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.160
But the plane crashes.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.480
Yeah, and they all die.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.360
It's pretty sick.

17:31.360 --> 17:36.160
I think every Krav Maga instructor,

17:36.160 --> 17:38.080
which is the deadliest martial art, right?

17:39.040 --> 17:40.880
Have we officially said actually,

17:40.880 --> 17:42.480
I feel like maybe at some point

17:42.480 --> 17:43.360
during the history of the show,

17:43.360 --> 17:45.200
we've said what the most deadly martial art is.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.160
It's the one that Don't Mess With The Zohan uses.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.680
So that's enough for me, thank you.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.520
Good, exactly.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.120
Every Krav Maga instructor

17:53.120 --> 17:54.880
has to have a contingency plan

17:54.880 --> 17:57.200
for this exact scenario

17:57.200 --> 18:00.960
where they have some sort of biotoxin

18:00.960 --> 18:04.080
in a syringe underneath the cash register

18:04.080 --> 18:06.160
that they use to take payments for the lessons.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.800
And then like, oh yeah, you're doing really good.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.480
You're just about to earn your green belt.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.320
You can just come over here.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.120
It's time to cash out.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.280
Stab him in the neck with the biotoxin.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.360
I'm so sorry, you're too dangerous.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.200
You try to stab him with the biotoxin

18:21.200 --> 18:22.320
and they stop your hand and like,

18:22.320 --> 18:23.520
damn it, I waited too long.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.880
Yeah, he's already ascended.

18:25.840 --> 18:26.800
How was I supposed to know

18:26.800 --> 18:28.640
that they only needed 35 seconds

18:28.640 --> 18:30.080
to become a Krav Maga master?

18:30.080 --> 18:31.200
This is unimaginable.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.320
Unimaginable.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.520
It's unimaginable.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.360
It's unimaginable.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.200
In my days as a Krav Maga instructor,

18:39.200 --> 18:40.960
I've seen a lot of students come through here

18:40.960 --> 18:42.320
and I've watched them progress.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.240
And in my wildest fantasy,

18:44.240 --> 18:46.400
sometimes I dream of a student

18:46.400 --> 18:50.160
who is progressing at an even faster rate.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.480
And then I saw you,

18:54.480 --> 18:57.920
and I've tested the bounds of my imagination

18:57.920 --> 19:00.960
to conceive of how you could be progressing at this rate.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.040
And I cannot conceive of it.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.720
Here are the keys to my dojo.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.800
I have to step down and go in a cave

19:06.800 --> 19:07.920
and think about this for a while.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.360
Just as a fun thought experiment.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.880
How fast can someone get good at kicking?

19:14.880 --> 19:18.560
Enough that somebody has their mind blown by it.

19:18.560 --> 19:22.880
Exactly this fast and no faster, most certainly.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.080
Oh God.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.040
No, no, no.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.720
Oh God, Zachary.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.680
Oh my goodness.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.120
I have to check the scrolls.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.480
Yeah, just kick this.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.920
This is a first test that we do here

19:33.920 --> 19:35.920
at Tim McGraw's Krav Maga.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.680
And the thing we do is we just like,

19:37.680 --> 19:39.440
I hold this up and you just kick it

19:39.440 --> 19:40.000
and I see how...

19:47.200 --> 19:48.000
How could this be?

19:48.640 --> 19:49.520
How could this be?

19:50.640 --> 19:53.200
My concept of reality is dissolving around me.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.040
Everyone get out.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.600
I have to go pray to the patron spirit

19:57.600 --> 20:00.400
of Tim McGraw's Krav Maga and find out.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.440
You got Tim.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.800
Tim, you'll never believe.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.440
Tim, it's me.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.400
Try to imagine how good someone could progress.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.280
You can't.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.640
Tim, you can't.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.680
It's Tim McGraw.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.760
Listen, I told you you could use my name,

20:11.760 --> 20:13.120
but I was also real clear.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.200
I don't know anything about Krav Maga.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.240
So I'm gonna have to trust your judgment on this.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.920
Just tell me what to do, Tim, please.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.040
Listen, I've informed you repeatedly.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.000
I'm not even familiar with Krav Maga as any fighting style.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.360
That kid's so good, Tim.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.680
Just give me some guidance.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.280
Trust me with your wisdom.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.080
My only fighting technique is smashing a beer bottle

20:32.080 --> 20:33.200
and cutting a fool.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.240
I'll try it.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.040
Okay, click.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.400
I gotta be honest, when you told me

20:38.400 --> 20:39.760
you were opening a Krav Maga place,

20:39.760 --> 20:41.840
I thought it was a Mediterranean restaurant.

20:43.840 --> 20:44.800
Which I would love.

20:44.800 --> 20:45.760
That's on me, I guess.

20:45.760 --> 20:46.640
I love that shit.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.000
You got naan, tzatziki?

20:48.640 --> 20:49.440
I'm all about it.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.360
Listen, I sent you a picture of myself

20:53.360 --> 20:56.640
dipping some pita into hummus to use for the logo,

20:56.640 --> 20:59.360
and you did not send that photo back to me.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.960
So I thought that was for me to keep, Tim.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.600
I'm so sorry.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.400
You used it for like the logo of your dojo,

21:04.400 --> 21:05.440
your dojo logo.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.200
Which I thought was weird,

21:07.200 --> 21:08.160
because who's gonna sign that?

21:08.160 --> 21:12.480
Like, well, there's country music superstar Tim McGraw

21:12.480 --> 21:15.360
enjoying some Mediterranean bean dips.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.960
But on your logo, you have photoshopped out the pita bread

21:18.960 --> 21:20.480
and changed it to a shuriken,

21:20.480 --> 21:21.680
which seems weird to me

21:21.680 --> 21:23.840
since I don't even think that's a Krav Maga place.

21:23.840 --> 21:24.640
Yeah, I just said-

21:24.640 --> 21:26.640
I heard that you were still dipping it in hummus.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.840
Is that not good enough?

21:27.840 --> 21:29.360
I did a cursory Google search,

21:29.360 --> 21:32.560
and almost certainly they do not use shurikens in Krav Maga,

21:32.560 --> 21:34.400
and they definitely do not dip them in hummus

21:34.400 --> 21:36.240
before throwing them sunbeaches.

21:36.240 --> 21:39.360
And listen, it seems like you photoshopped the hummus out

21:39.360 --> 21:41.120
and put in the brains of my enemy.

21:41.120 --> 21:41.840
How do I know?

21:41.840 --> 21:44.960
Because you've put a speech bubble above my head that said,

21:44.960 --> 21:47.520
this is the brains of my enemy, not hummus.

21:47.520 --> 21:48.960
Hey Tim, I gotta go.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.760
I've got this person kicking real good in the dojo.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.320
I'm gonna need to see your Bonifides, my man,

21:54.320 --> 21:59.360
because I do not think that you are excellent at photoshop

21:59.360 --> 22:03.600
and I think bad at Krav Maga, I have to imagine.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.320
Oh man.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.480
How about another question?

22:07.120 --> 22:10.320
My cube mate whispers to herself constantly.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.160
Sometimes she's reading out loud to herself.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.680
Sometimes she's talking to herself.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.520
Sometimes I can't even tell what she's saying,

22:15.520 --> 22:17.360
but I hear the whispers.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.000
Oh my God.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.440
This is hella distracting.

22:19.440 --> 22:23.440
Why there hasn't been a cube mate there in over 40 years.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.000
This is hella distracting because I'm pretty down with ASMR

22:26.000 --> 22:26.880
and I can't get any work done.

22:26.880 --> 22:27.600
Oh shit.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.880
Oh fuck, this took a turn.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.000
This took a twist.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.160
Any ideas on how to address this?

22:34.160 --> 22:35.920
That's from, huh, in Houston.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.000
See I thought we were going with like,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.280
it's annoying because what always kills,

22:41.280 --> 22:43.040
I tell you why people like that drive me crazy

22:43.040 --> 22:44.560
and it's not an ASMR thing.

22:44.560 --> 22:48.000
I can't stand when you're the only person

22:48.560 --> 22:50.640
in a room with someone else who starts talking

22:50.640 --> 22:54.560
and of course you're like, what, are you, sorry?

22:54.560 --> 22:57.280
Are you talking to me?

22:57.280 --> 22:59.440
Okay, it's like, no, I'm just reading

22:59.440 --> 23:00.560
a really funny Ziggy cartoon.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.920
Sorry, I'll try to keep it down.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.840
But how many times does that have to happen

23:03.840 --> 23:07.280
before the person is like, I need to stop talking to myself

23:07.280 --> 23:08.960
because like 30 times a day,

23:08.960 --> 23:11.440
Debra's leaning around going, excuse me, what?

23:11.440 --> 23:13.200
Did you, what did you say?

23:13.200 --> 23:15.760
Eventually you would think that the cube mate would be like,

23:15.760 --> 23:16.640
I need to shut it.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.520
Trev, I don't know if you've worked in a lot of offices,

23:19.520 --> 23:23.760
but there are always people who like, no, they don't.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.280
Like they don't have any,

23:25.280 --> 23:28.480
like you think that they would get better at this,

23:28.480 --> 23:31.120
this scenario that everyone is in

23:31.120 --> 23:33.920
and they don't, like they belligerently don't

23:33.920 --> 23:35.680
ever grow as people.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.000
What if you just quietly start whispering back?

23:38.880 --> 23:40.960
If they're like, I gotta staple this

23:40.960 --> 23:42.000
and you're like, yeah, you do.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.280
Where do you see my wiener?

23:47.280 --> 23:47.760
Your what?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.440
My wiener, yeah.

23:49.440 --> 23:53.200
Yeah, it's me, it's me, the ding dong buddies.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.560
I'm both of them, I am both of the ding dong buddies

23:59.120 --> 24:00.240
and this is my new song,

24:00.240 --> 24:03.120
Wait Till My Wiener Makes It's Debut.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.000
I think that the ASMR thing actually gives you a leg up

24:10.000 --> 24:13.440
because one surefire way to get this person to stop

24:13.440 --> 24:17.200
is to explain what is happening to you.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.000
I think that would get me to stop right quick.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.400
Excuse me, when you whisper,

24:25.040 --> 24:29.600
it gives me a denim boner,

24:29.600 --> 24:32.720
a denim style tingling in the back of my head.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.600
You know denim?

24:34.320 --> 24:36.560
You know the feel of denim on sheets?

24:36.560 --> 24:37.200
It's like that.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.520
When are we gonna do an ASMR episode?

24:39.520 --> 24:43.440
Oh fuck, we definitely should do an ASMR episode.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.640
I feel like the ASMR episode is like there.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.880
It's waiting for us to pluck some of it.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.880
Already somebody's done a super cut

24:50.880 --> 24:54.800
of like our 288 episodes every time we whisper

24:54.800 --> 24:56.560
and it's like four hours long.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.880
Yeah, I just gave us a good like 20 seconds of material

24:58.880 --> 25:00.400
right there with my ding dong buddies run.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.080
That was somebody's trigger.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.160
Yeah, that's going straight on the greatest hit CD.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.280
Or the quietest, it would be the quietest hits.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.960
This is the second question in a row

25:10.960 --> 25:13.440
where somebody's mentioned working in a cube.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.800
Is that what we're calling cubicles right now?

25:14.800 --> 25:16.880
Because right now it just kind of sounds like you're floating around

25:17.440 --> 25:20.560
in like some sort of geometry void

25:21.120 --> 25:23.840
and that like a wizard trapped you in.

25:23.840 --> 25:24.160
Right.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.160
And I guess what I find-

25:26.160 --> 25:27.840
Sometimes that's what it feels like.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.040
Am I right Mondays?

25:29.040 --> 25:29.520
Dilbert.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.040
Dilbert from downtown.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.480
Maybe you could like sound insulate your cubicle.

25:34.480 --> 25:37.760
Maybe put some baffling up, maybe some fiberglass,

25:38.400 --> 25:41.280
some Navajo rugs, just something

25:41.280 --> 25:43.360
to try to deaden the sound a little bit

25:43.360 --> 25:45.200
or like shove something in your ears.

25:45.200 --> 25:49.040
You can put your mattress foam on their cubicle too

25:49.040 --> 25:50.480
just to absorb some of the noise.

25:51.040 --> 25:51.680
Don't mind me.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.720
Oh, it's six foot by three foot.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.080
Oh, I got a great piece for this.

25:56.080 --> 25:56.480
Okay.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.440
This is great.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.240
Can you just play music on your computer

26:00.240 --> 26:02.560
that drowns out the noise of the whispers

26:02.560 --> 26:04.800
like just a bunch of trombones going?

26:06.640 --> 26:07.280
No, you know what?

26:07.280 --> 26:09.760
I just thought about it and literally any music will do.

26:09.760 --> 26:10.640
It doesn't have to be trombones.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.000
Yeah, it doesn't have to be.

26:12.000 --> 26:12.960
It doesn't have to be trombones.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.600
It came to my mind.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.280
It was like, hey Griffin, think of something

26:15.280 --> 26:16.560
to say on the podcast right now

26:16.560 --> 26:18.000
that would be like loud music.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.760
I was like, oh, I know trombones.

26:19.760 --> 26:24.320
Not like any EDM or any rock music with guitars in it.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.720
You could, I mean like any music.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.040
Just like any music you turn it up loud enough.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.320
Doesn't have to be trombones.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.400
My point is it doesn't just have to be trombones.

26:33.040 --> 26:36.320
A lot of people think it has to be trombones.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.320
Is trombones the opposite of ASMR?

26:38.320 --> 26:39.680
Because if we do an ASMR episode,

26:39.680 --> 26:41.440
we got to do a trombone episode.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.920
I think it's like the palette cleanser of ASMR.

26:43.920 --> 26:44.960
You're starting to get tingles.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.120
And you're like, oh, thank God.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.160
I was so close.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.800
Thank you for ASMR edging me.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.960
I got to say, gross.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.760
I also got to say that movie Trumbo

26:55.760 --> 26:57.040
that got nominated for Oscar

26:57.040 --> 26:58.800
that I've literally never heard of before.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.080
Is that about trombones?

27:01.200 --> 27:03.040
Yeah, but it's like the slang.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.120
It's a street slang term for it.

27:05.120 --> 27:07.920
Sling me that Trumbo, said Dizzy Gillespie.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.000
Well, what's funny is it's also a slang term.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.360
His body tries handing a new instrument.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.520
It's also a slang term for like the groupies

27:15.520 --> 27:17.840
that follow trombonists around.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.280
Like, oh, they're a real Trumbo.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.080
You know what I mean?

27:20.080 --> 27:20.320
Okay.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.520
But it can get confusing when you say pass me that Trumbo

27:23.520 --> 27:25.680
and you're like, wait, do you mean the instrument

27:25.680 --> 27:26.560
or the groupie?

27:26.560 --> 27:29.280
And by that point, you've used more words and letters

27:29.280 --> 27:32.080
than you would have by just saying the full word

27:32.080 --> 27:34.320
like Trumbo, groupie or Trumbo.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.440
Just Trumbo, yeah.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.120
I got to see Trumbo.

27:37.120 --> 27:37.920
It sounds hilarious.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.760
It's pretty great.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.520
And you should also check out Trumbo Drop.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.560
You mean Operation Trumbo Drop?

27:46.000 --> 27:46.240
Yeah.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.640
Oh, with a setup and an alley-oop.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.480
Oh, that's another thing you can say during the football game.

27:55.040 --> 27:55.520
Yeah.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.960
Give it to me again, Travis.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.760
And Griffin will just edit it in to like,

27:59.760 --> 28:01.360
pretend that you just come up with it

28:01.360 --> 28:02.640
and you're just saying it.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.360
Just like full title Operation Trumbo Drop.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.200
Yeah, but like isolate it.

28:07.200 --> 28:07.920
Okay, let me see it.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.680
Oh, like Operation Trumbo Drop with a steal,

28:11.680 --> 28:13.920
with a fucking swooped in.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.200
You just got dunked on.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.600
Dunkarooskies.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.240
That's another thing you can say during the football game.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.120
Let's go to the money zone.

28:31.760 --> 28:32.240
We're there.

28:33.760 --> 28:34.640
Look around you.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.360
Look around you.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.440
You've been in the money zone the whole time.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.280
The whole show's the money zone.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.640
The money zone is us.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.680
I want to talk about Nature Box.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.720
Can I talk about Nature Box?

28:43.360 --> 28:44.880
Yes, please do.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.080
I love snacking,

28:46.080 --> 28:48.640
and I'm worried that I have a snack obsession

28:49.360 --> 28:50.800
because I just snack every day.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.000
And I can't go to sleep without eating snacks in my mouth,

28:54.000 --> 28:55.040
which is dangerous.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.240
Fortunately, there's a snack provider out there

28:58.240 --> 28:59.920
that can change your life,

28:59.920 --> 29:01.520
and it's called Nature Box.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.680
Nature Box has over 100 tasty options

29:03.680 --> 29:04.640
for you to choose from.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.200
Snack options like sriracha roasted cashews

29:07.200 --> 29:08.560
and french toast granola.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.320
You can fill out your snack profile,

29:10.320 --> 29:11.680
get personalized recommendations

29:11.680 --> 29:12.880
based on your preferences,

29:12.880 --> 29:14.320
and get matched up to go on dates

29:14.320 --> 29:16.800
with people who like the same snacks that you like.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.760
Well, not yet.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.960
I also like granola.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.520
Let's kiss.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.600
Let's have a granola kiss.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.480
What's that?

29:22.480 --> 29:24.080
Well, we both put granola in our mouths,

29:24.080 --> 29:25.600
and then what happens next is up to us.

29:26.800 --> 29:27.920
There's a new...

29:28.560 --> 29:30.000
I got a new Nature Box.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.600
I'm like, you can set up your own Nature Box snacks

29:35.600 --> 29:38.080
to get the specific things that you want.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.720
I like to just go crazy.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.920
Whatever you guys want to toss at me,

29:43.920 --> 29:45.680
I'm sure I'll get into it.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.000
There's a new one called crispy coconut squares

29:48.640 --> 29:49.760
that I tried this time.

29:49.760 --> 29:50.800
Oh my gosh.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.400
They're like a crunchy...

29:54.400 --> 29:55.440
God, they're impossible to describe,

29:55.440 --> 29:57.040
but they're absolutely delicious,

29:58.480 --> 30:01.280
and I cannot recommend them enough.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.400
There's so many really, really good snacks

30:04.400 --> 30:05.760
that they do.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.880
I got one peanut...

30:06.880 --> 30:09.280
Who was talking about peanut butter graham jams?

30:09.280 --> 30:10.000
That was me.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.280
Oh man, those are good traps.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.040
You were right about those.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.320
And you can check out all of this

30:14.320 --> 30:16.240
and get your first box at naturebox.com.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.640
Just head to Nature Box, right?

30:18.640 --> 30:19.520
Stick the landing here,

30:19.520 --> 30:21.600
because this is the best line in marketing ever.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.520
Head to naturebox.com right now

30:23.520 --> 30:26.480
to unbox a world of taste and possibility.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.440
I like to imagine there should be a door.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.640
You go to naturebox.com

30:30.640 --> 30:32.960
and there's a little gif of a door,

30:32.960 --> 30:34.560
and when you click on it,

30:34.560 --> 30:38.560
like there's just like you see the universe.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.960
Everything is edible as long as it's in a nature box.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.360
Yeah, and like there's a million, million butterflies.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.520
I want to tell you guys about Bowling Branch.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.080
Can I do that?

30:48.800 --> 30:50.080
Oh, please do.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.760
Actually, Justin, you tell me about Bowling Branch

30:51.760 --> 30:53.360
because you're sleeping on these shits.

30:53.360 --> 30:58.560
Oh, I'm constantly, constantly sleeping on these sheets

30:58.560 --> 30:59.280
when I'm asleep.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.200
How do they interact with denim?

31:01.200 --> 31:04.640
They are perfect match for denim,

31:04.640 --> 31:06.880
provided you take the denim off before you get into bed.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.840
Nothing reminds you of how bad denim feels

31:09.840 --> 31:12.880
like the soft comfort of Bowling Branch sheets.

31:12.880 --> 31:17.280
Bowling Branch, that's B-O-L-L and Branch.com

31:17.280 --> 31:18.480
make great sheets.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.920
If you've ever slept on like a bed,

31:19.920 --> 31:21.520
I use the hotel comparison a lot

31:21.520 --> 31:22.720
when I'm talking about Bowling Branch.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.400
Like you sleep on sheets sometimes in a hotel

31:24.400 --> 31:26.400
and you're like, where are they buying these?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.000
And not like a shitty hotel.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.320
Not like a hotel that was only $43.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.680
This is like that, you know what?

31:31.680 --> 31:35.040
We're going to splurge $175 a night kind of hotel.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.400
Yeah, like a nice place.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.760
And you think, where do you guys get these sheets?

31:37.760 --> 31:39.840
Because I've bought a lot of sheets

31:39.840 --> 31:41.840
trying to find something that matched the quality of these

31:41.840 --> 31:44.320
that give me that hotel luxury experience.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.400
I haven't found them until I started sleeping on Bowling Branch.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.240
They come in this beautiful decorative box.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.400
You feel like a real fancy prince

31:50.400 --> 31:51.520
and when you're unwrapping them

31:51.520 --> 31:52.560
and then you feel less fancy

31:52.560 --> 31:54.240
when you got to put your own sheets on your own bed.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.840
I bet princes never have to do that.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.120
But then when you get into bed,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.560
you feel like a prince again.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.840
So you like feel like a prince.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.520
And then you have a good tar boner

32:01.520 --> 32:02.720
and you feel like prince.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.800
Yeah, it's a real prince of the pauper scenario.

32:06.000 --> 32:06.640
Here's the best thing.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.160
Maybe you're a little bit hesitant

32:08.160 --> 32:09.680
because you're like, I don't know, buy them online.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.840
I don't get to like, you know, check them out first.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.880
Well, good news.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.680
They're going to let you try them risk-free for 30 nights.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.760
And you're going to love it though, trust me.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.280
I've been sleeping on them as well.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.160
They are amazing

32:20.160 --> 32:22.880
and they seem to just get more and more comfortable over time

32:22.880 --> 32:26.240
because they use like super high quality cotton.

32:26.240 --> 32:29.120
And it's really, it's really princely.

32:29.120 --> 32:32.000
As a special my bim bam bonus,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.880
you can buy sheets that have come

32:34.880 --> 32:38.000
with our own individual smells pre-baked into them.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.280
Our own individual unique sleep musks.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.640
Do not mix them together.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.280
Do not to mix them together.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.720
You can get right now 20% off your first order

32:48.720 --> 32:51.360
if you use the promo code, MYBROTHER, all one word.

32:51.360 --> 32:55.840
That's bowlandbranch, B-O-L-L and branch.com.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.520
Boy, they must've been so embarrassed

32:57.520 --> 33:00.160
when they realized they didn't spell it B-O-W-L.

33:00.160 --> 33:04.640
B-O-L-L and branch.com, promo code, MYBROTHER.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.680
Don't punish them because they don't know how to spell bowl.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.960
Go buy their sheets.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.800
All right, we got a Jumbotron message.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.240
This is for Andrew.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.440
It's from Matt.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.360
Let's see it right to it.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.440
Happy birthday, little bro.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.120
And happy future birthdays

33:19.120 --> 33:21.360
because this present is worth a few birthdays.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.080
Nice. I agree.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.840
Hopefully this got in on time.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.400
What with your birthday being November 20th and all.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.080
Yeah, you got it, split the uprights.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.200
Slamma jamma ding dong.

33:30.880 --> 33:31.840
Pass the hummus.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.840
Between his birthday and some other day.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.280
Pass the fucking hummus, Andrew.

33:35.280 --> 33:35.920
You crushed it.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.120
Anyway, thanks for introducing me to NB and BAM

33:39.120 --> 33:40.880
and making my life that much funnier.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.320
I agree with this being worth a few birthdays

33:44.320 --> 33:45.040
because here's the thing,

33:45.040 --> 33:47.680
you can listen to this episode of this podcast any time.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.200
It's a great thing about podcasts, they're eternal.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.000
The weird thing is it's not consecutive birthdays.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.920
This is gonna be good for his 24th, his 28th and his 33rd.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.240
Yeah, but you know what birthday it won't be good for?

33:58.240 --> 33:59.600
The intended birthday,

33:59.600 --> 34:01.520
because that was fucking four months ago.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.440
Oh, well, po buddy's nerfect.

34:05.440 --> 34:09.520
This message is for Jesse and it's from Also Jesse.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.920
And Jesse says to themselves,

34:11.920 --> 34:15.440
hey man, I am communicating to you across the void

34:15.440 --> 34:16.800
through telepathy, kind of.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.400
If I did my math correctly,

34:18.400 --> 34:20.480
the brothers should be reading this on your birthday.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.680
Almost certainly not.

34:21.680 --> 34:26.400
Happy 31st from three to four months ago.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.480
I truly hope you are keeping it tight

34:28.480 --> 34:30.560
and if you need me, I'm on my mobile.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.160
So good, so, so good.

34:34.160 --> 34:38.240
Do you think this is from Jesse to Jesse themselves?

34:38.240 --> 34:40.320
Or do you think that it's just like

34:40.320 --> 34:42.640
there happened to be two Jesses in the world?

34:43.600 --> 34:45.600
I think there's definitely more than two Jesses in the world.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.720
Well, I've never seen them in a room together.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.640
Shit, that's right.

34:50.640 --> 34:53.840
Wait a minute, Jesse is Jesse.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.200
The perfect disguise.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.360
But who's Jesse's girl?

34:57.360 --> 34:58.640
Oh, stop it.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.720
I wanted to mention something.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.440
We alluded there to the best personal message

35:03.440 --> 35:07.680
we've ever read on the show for Elliot from Matt Hall.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.120
I went back and looked at it just now

35:09.120 --> 35:10.480
because it'd been a while.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.320
And there's something I've never noticed before.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.560
The and, the message is of course,

35:16.560 --> 35:18.880
thanks for vibing it and keeping it tight.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.720
If you need me, I'm on my mobile.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.120
First off, I don't think we said vibing it.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.440
I think we just said vibing, right?

35:26.080 --> 35:28.160
And the and is all caps.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.320
So the message is actually like

35:33.120 --> 35:34.640
the main thing that they wanna communicate

35:34.640 --> 35:37.680
is that they've somehow managed to both vibe it

35:37.680 --> 35:38.720
and keep it tight.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.320
That's really the impressive thing.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.000
How could they, it's unimaginable

35:42.000 --> 35:45.040
that they were able to both vibe it and keep it tight.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.080
Yeah, cause vibing it, the very act of vibing it

35:48.080 --> 35:49.520
usually just loosens that thing up.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.200
Kept it very, very tight.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.000
And that's impressive.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.200
Very tight.

35:57.280 --> 35:57.920
Let's be honest.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.280
We live in a world with too much media.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.280
You need a podcast on the front lines

36:01.280 --> 36:02.800
figuring out what's great.

36:02.800 --> 36:03.760
We're here for you.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.720
We're Pop Rocket.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.840
I call myself a digital strategist.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.720

36:28.800 --> 36:30.320
You wanna have the Yahoo question?

36:30.320 --> 36:32.400
Yeah, I'd love a Yahoo question, Griffin.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.160
I got a bunch here.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.560
Do the best one.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.760
Well, fuck, that's tough to...

36:38.480 --> 36:39.200
I know.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.200
I got three Drew Davenports.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.760
Can I, you want me to just...

36:43.760 --> 36:47.200
You can trade those in for one mega port.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.680
I'm gonna fire these Drew Davenports at you guys.

36:49.680 --> 36:50.800
Just rapid fire it and you tell me

36:50.800 --> 36:52.480
which one you wanna really explore

36:52.480 --> 36:53.600
because I honestly can't choose.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.520
It's level 9000.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.200
Yeah, Drew, Drew Davenport, of course.

36:57.200 --> 36:57.760
Thank you, Drew.

36:58.560 --> 37:01.120
This one is from Devin who asks,

37:01.680 --> 37:03.760
if you put Mountain Dew in a purifier,

37:03.760 --> 37:05.760
would you get water or Mountain Dew?

37:05.760 --> 37:07.360
I think there's something to talk about there.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.120
This one is from Sal who asks,

37:11.680 --> 37:13.520
every time I go to lick a stamp,

37:13.520 --> 37:15.440
I really want to gently kiss it instead.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.080
Is this okay?

37:17.280 --> 37:20.400
And then this one is from something's gone wrong.

37:20.400 --> 37:25.920
Column Bernard asks, big hands?

37:26.720 --> 37:28.640
When do I start getting big hands?

37:28.640 --> 37:29.680
I'm 18 years old.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.360
When do I start getting bigger hands?

37:32.480 --> 37:34.240
I think it's going to be big hands.

37:34.240 --> 37:36.960
Yeah, although I am curious

37:36.960 --> 37:39.360
if you put Mountain Dew in a purifier,

37:39.360 --> 37:44.000
you just get like that crisp Mountain Dew.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.680
I think it just turns into vodka.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.240
Why is this so crisp?

37:49.120 --> 37:50.720
Is this pure Mountain Dew?

37:50.720 --> 37:52.320
I think that's how Dewshine is made.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.560
All right, let's close that.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.040
Get out of here.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.160
Close that one out.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.440
Okay, so somebody watched the video forever long

37:59.440 --> 38:00.960
and they're like, wait a minute,

38:00.960 --> 38:02.960
the Foo Fighters managed to get big hands.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.160
When do I get big hands?

38:05.200 --> 38:08.000
Do I need to do some intricate steamrolling?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.760
Because that usually happens in cartoons.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.120
We've made a huge mistake.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.880
Big hands aren't as funny as I thought they would be.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.160
Get out of your big hands.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.520
Every time I know the stamp,

38:17.520 --> 38:19.440
I really want to gently kiss it instead.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.080
Is this okay?

38:21.680 --> 38:24.400
I think it just depends on what the stamp is.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.560
Are we talking like American presidents?

38:26.560 --> 38:30.560
Are we talking like hippie symbols through the years?

38:30.560 --> 38:33.280
Are we talking like, I don't know,

38:35.200 --> 38:36.480
World War II pilots?

38:36.480 --> 38:37.680
I'm never stopping.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.040
Yeah, just keep naming things.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.560
Maybe Woodstock performers.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.480
Maybe Woodstock.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.320
Maybe Woodstock.

38:45.680 --> 38:49.440
It might be a Snoopy situation, a peanut situation.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.520
It could be famous circus elephants.

38:51.520 --> 38:54.240
It could be inventors of the 1820s.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.720
It could be the many faces of Elvis.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.560
I mean, there's lots of different stamps out there.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.160
The different finger bones that there are.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.720
How many finger bones are there?

39:02.720 --> 39:04.560
Look at these stamps to find out.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.480
You'll never believe how many finger bones

39:06.480 --> 39:08.480
there are. Number 23 blew me away.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.440
Fun stamp facts.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.520
Which is ironic because it's on stamps.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.160
There are stamps that have pictures of other stamps on them.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.520
Those are very rare.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.080
If you find those, hold on to them for dear life,

39:20.080 --> 39:22.320
Charlie Bucket, and run home.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.200
Run home, Charlie.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.880
Don't show anyone your stamp stamps.

39:26.880 --> 39:30.720
There's Jeff Probst dick pic stamps that I made.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.680
They're not legal, Tinder.

39:33.680 --> 39:34.000
Not legal.

39:34.000 --> 39:34.880
No, please don't use those.

39:34.880 --> 39:38.800
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if stamps were edible?

39:38.800 --> 39:40.320
What if every time you got mail,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.160
after they did their job as postage,

39:44.160 --> 39:45.600
every time you got mail,

39:45.600 --> 39:48.560
you saw, oh man, I got like five candy treats

39:48.560 --> 39:49.360
just waiting for me.

39:49.360 --> 39:52.880
Like little dissolvable candy treats waiting for me.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.080
Stuck to the, because they're just going to go

39:54.080 --> 39:56.000
in the garbage otherwise.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.440
Like why couldn't they be edible?

39:57.440 --> 39:58.400
Like if you peel them off-

39:58.400 --> 39:59.760
Fuck that's good, Justin.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.480
Yeah.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.800
The only problem you do is you have to make one third

40:02.800 --> 40:05.680
of them edible, but you don't have any kind of sign

40:05.680 --> 40:07.440
as to which ones are and which ones aren't.

40:07.440 --> 40:08.480
You just have to try it.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.920
And then think of how exciting it is

40:09.920 --> 40:12.160
when you get one that is and you're like, no.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.400
Okay, one third edible.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.320
I don't think, let me say this.

40:16.320 --> 40:19.280
If one third of stamps are candy edibles,

40:19.280 --> 40:22.160
I do not think you're going to sit and eat a pile of stamps.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.800
If one third are edible.

40:24.800 --> 40:29.200
There is, however, a number between all stamps being edible

40:29.200 --> 40:30.960
and one third stamps being edible

40:30.960 --> 40:33.520
in which you would try to eat every stamp you got.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.280
Right?

40:35.280 --> 40:36.080
You're saying-

40:36.080 --> 40:37.520
I thought you were going to say the number.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.200
You're saying we don't know what that science

40:39.200 --> 40:40.560
has not found that number yet.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.200
I don't know if it was 50-50.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.160
I think I would probably find better ways of spending my time

40:46.160 --> 40:48.640
if 80% of stamps were candy edibles.

40:48.640 --> 40:48.880
Yeah.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.680
I might sit-

40:49.680 --> 40:50.320
You would stop.

40:51.680 --> 40:52.480
I get what Justin's saying.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.680
He would stop differentiating because he would assume,

40:55.680 --> 40:58.480
well, this here, this is male candy.

40:58.480 --> 41:01.600
But I think the problem with 80-20

41:01.600 --> 41:04.720
is now the 20 has become a disappointment

41:04.720 --> 41:07.120
rather than the 80 being a pleasant surprise.

41:07.120 --> 41:07.760
Yeah.

41:07.760 --> 41:08.160
Can I just-

41:08.160 --> 41:10.560
Now you're getting punished for getting one of the 20%.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.560
Let's put a pin in this because I've realized

41:12.560 --> 41:15.360
just sort of one problem with the candy stamps idea,

41:15.360 --> 41:16.960
and Justin, it's a great idea.

41:16.960 --> 41:17.360
Terrific idea.

41:17.360 --> 41:17.920
Thank you, Griffin.

41:17.920 --> 41:18.480
Thank you, Griffin.

41:18.480 --> 41:19.280
Easy to produce, too.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.160
Just cut out little pieces of fruit.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.360
Copyright, TM, TM.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.880
Cut out little pieces of fruit roll-ups

41:22.880 --> 41:24.640
and then there, Bob's your uncle.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.280
The only problem with this idea, Justin,

41:27.280 --> 41:28.800
is by the time that the letter gets to you,

41:28.800 --> 41:32.080
it has been touched by 200 of the dirtiest hands imaginable.

41:33.520 --> 41:37.200
200 of these hands, unimaginable how dirty they are.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.600
Maybe it's sealed in its own wrapper.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.200
Okay, perfect.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.200
I got a good idea then.

41:43.200 --> 41:46.800
50% of stamps are candy edibles, 50% are antibiotics.

41:46.800 --> 41:47.680
So you eat-

41:47.680 --> 41:48.080
Nice.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.480
So you eat the candy ones and you also eat the antibiotic ones.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.080
But you have to do it like a tequila shot.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.200
You eat the candy stamp and you immediately chase it

41:55.200 --> 41:57.440
by drinking antibiotics?

41:57.440 --> 41:58.400
Mm-hmm.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.360
But you don't-

41:59.360 --> 42:00.560
Out of someone's navel.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.880
You don't know which are which.

42:02.880 --> 42:06.960
So it's like, oh, I just ate five antibiotic stamps in a row.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.320
I'm really grossed out.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.040
But super healthy.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.240
I really hope I get some candy.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.240
Or all the stamps you get that day are candy.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.320
Like, well, somebody's getting a head cold.

42:16.160 --> 42:16.560
Okay.

42:16.560 --> 42:17.520
I like all of this.

42:17.520 --> 42:18.240
This is great.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.720
For me, it's less worried about the contagion of it

42:20.720 --> 42:23.920
and more like just knowing, oh my,

42:23.920 --> 42:25.360
so many dirty hands have touched this.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.240
I've passed this around.

42:27.120 --> 42:27.840
I'm not a fan.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.320
Maybe they just work around the like,

42:30.320 --> 42:32.800
just like it becomes a postal thing,

42:33.360 --> 42:35.920
like a superstition if you want to,

42:35.920 --> 42:38.080
if you want to just like a rule,

42:38.080 --> 42:39.680
like don't touch the stamp.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.880
Well, you wouldn't want to because you get those sticky hands.

42:42.880 --> 42:43.200
You don't want that.

42:43.200 --> 42:43.920
Oh, yeah.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.400
Well, they wouldn't touch it because you're self-fulfilling prophecy.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.240
They wouldn't touch the stamp because they don't want their hands-

42:48.240 --> 42:49.360
They don't want sticky hands.

42:49.360 --> 42:49.840
Yeah, shit.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.320
This is good.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.920
This is all good.

42:51.920 --> 42:52.480
Full proof.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.760
Now, here is the question.

42:55.760 --> 42:56.240
Oh, boy.

42:58.960 --> 43:03.760
If the person who is sending the stamp has to lick it,

43:05.760 --> 43:08.160
wouldn't it be better if they were kissing it?

43:08.720 --> 43:09.840
Because that would be-

43:09.840 --> 43:11.040
You kiss anybody.

43:11.040 --> 43:12.320
You kiss anybody and everybody.

43:14.320 --> 43:17.600
And so I think that would be better.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.120
Just gonna charge right through that statement.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.560
Just like bully it.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.320
Just bully it onto our podcast.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.600
I don't understand, Justin.

43:23.600 --> 43:23.920
Please repeat.

43:23.920 --> 43:28.960
I'm saying, okay, if through space and time,

43:28.960 --> 43:34.480
this candy stamp is bringing you the physical greeting of affection

43:34.480 --> 43:38.240
from another person or maybe somebody who works at the IRS

43:38.240 --> 43:40.000
or somebody who has sent you a catalog,

43:41.280 --> 43:47.440
I think that you would prefer the thought that they kissed the stamp

43:47.440 --> 43:49.600
and sent it off to you and you're eating a kiss.

43:49.600 --> 43:52.080
Okay, then they lick the stamp and it's like

43:52.080 --> 43:54.080
they're licking the inside of your mouth.

43:54.080 --> 43:54.560
Okay.

43:54.560 --> 43:59.200
It's all, Justin, if I may, both are pretty bad.

43:59.200 --> 43:59.920
It's all bad.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.280
It's all very bad.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.840
It's bad all the way down.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.560
The reason, by the way, I want to just take this

44:06.560 --> 44:08.080
into a quick sidebar.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.040
The reason-

44:09.040 --> 44:11.520
Yeah, please get me the fuck out of this bar.

44:11.520 --> 44:13.760
I hate this regular bar we're in right now.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.000
The reason I got distracted is when I said

44:16.000 --> 44:17.600
you kiss everyone and everything.

44:17.600 --> 44:20.320
Yeah. I remembered a true life story

44:20.320 --> 44:21.440
that I wanted to share.

44:21.440 --> 44:25.680
I sold my home this week, my former home that I lived in,

44:25.680 --> 44:29.600
and I was the only one on the deed for some reason,

44:29.600 --> 44:31.040
not me and Sid, so it would just be-

44:31.040 --> 44:31.440
Weird.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.520
At the closing and I was very excited.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.160
Hi, Patrick.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.040
Patrick bought our house.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.880
Patrick, dear friend, Patrick Stanley.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.880
I hope you guys are enjoying the home, but anyway-

44:39.680 --> 44:42.080
Good luck finding where I took all my secret shits.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.040
Signed the paperwork.

44:43.040 --> 44:47.360
My realtor was there. Her name was Lori.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.200
My realtor was there.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.720
We had finished signing the paperwork,

44:50.720 --> 44:56.480
and she gave me sort of like one of those Christian side hugs

44:56.480 --> 44:58.880
to celebrate as we were leaving,

44:58.880 --> 45:00.400
because I guess she felt bad for me

45:00.400 --> 45:02.800
because I was there by myself during this momentous occasion.

45:02.800 --> 45:03.200
Yeah.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.120
As we were leaving, she gave me a side hug,

45:05.120 --> 45:08.400
and I turned towards her to turn it into a full hug,

45:08.400 --> 45:11.840
to do the full hug conversion, because I don't like the side hug.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.400
Oh, boy.

45:12.400 --> 45:18.320
And out of nowhere, before I realized what I was doing,

45:18.880 --> 45:21.760
as I hugged her, I kissed her cheek.

45:21.760 --> 45:25.040
Yes, man.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.120
And then you had to burn the house to the ground

45:27.120 --> 45:28.320
because it had seemed too much.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.600
It should have been one of the happiest days of my life.

45:31.600 --> 45:33.040
I ruined it.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.960
I walked back to my car thinking,

45:34.960 --> 45:37.040
what the fuck did you just do?

45:37.040 --> 45:37.840
Who are you?

45:38.720 --> 45:40.800
You just kissed her cheek.

45:40.800 --> 45:44.400
Give me a fucking, give me the,

45:44.400 --> 45:46.880
I need to know the trajectory, the angle.

45:46.880 --> 45:49.120
Like, did you just like plant it on there

45:49.120 --> 45:52.320
like you would do to a grandma?

45:52.320 --> 45:55.840
Or was it like, did you do it in like the French style?

45:55.840 --> 45:57.600
It was a grandma trajectory.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.400
And I have to say, even though I'm,

46:00.400 --> 46:02.400
listen, we all have a lot of fun here.

46:02.400 --> 46:06.560
I have to say, I think I sold it pretty confidently.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.080
I think she walked away from that thinking like-

46:08.080 --> 46:11.280
And walked me through it beat by beat.

46:11.280 --> 46:14.000
I think I gave you a pretty, a fucking zap,

46:14.000 --> 46:18.320
rudery breakdown of how it happened, Travis.

46:18.320 --> 46:22.320
But I need to know, okay, this will clarify it for me.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.960
Let's imagine we are in the 0.0001 second

46:26.960 --> 46:28.880
right after you have kissed her on the cheek.

46:28.880 --> 46:29.760
I don't want to be here.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.800
Describe to me the face that you made right after doing that.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.080
It probably would have been something like this.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.020
Like that.

46:36.020 --> 46:38.660
Probably something like that.

46:39.300 --> 46:40.180
I think you sold it.

46:40.180 --> 46:43.060
Did she seem like, what the fuck?

46:43.060 --> 46:45.940
No, it was like a really, you know what Griffin?

46:45.940 --> 46:49.300
I felt like I had dominated the situation socially

46:49.300 --> 46:51.380
because I think she walked away from it thinking,

46:51.380 --> 46:53.700
man, that must be pretty cool where he comes from.

46:53.700 --> 46:56.100
Like from his point of view.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.940
Oh, she thought you were so just a-

46:57.940 --> 46:58.580
Continental.

46:58.580 --> 46:59.380
Metropolitan.

46:59.380 --> 47:01.460
Exactly, exactly, very metropolitan.

47:02.580 --> 47:05.380
Ooh, big city man kissing cheeks.

47:05.380 --> 47:06.820
She knows where you live, Justin.

47:06.820 --> 47:08.820
She literally just sold your house.

47:08.820 --> 47:09.380
Literally.

47:09.380 --> 47:11.540
That must be really cool in his new house.

47:11.540 --> 47:12.740
She didn't know where my new house is.

47:13.380 --> 47:15.060
Listen, before we get a bunch of emails,

47:15.060 --> 47:16.580
I know that some people kiss cheeks.

47:16.580 --> 47:19.780
I know that this would not be a momentous occasion for everybody.

47:19.780 --> 47:23.620
This is not how I comport myself in the universe.

47:23.620 --> 47:24.500
It was very out of character.

47:24.500 --> 47:29.700
We keep our list of people whose cheeks we kiss very, very narrow.

47:29.700 --> 47:32.900
It's either our wives or our daddy, and that's it.

47:32.900 --> 47:33.620
That's it?

47:33.620 --> 47:34.580
That's it.

47:34.580 --> 47:36.660
It's a sacred bond that we have.

47:37.620 --> 47:39.300
We don't kiss each other on the cheeks.

47:39.300 --> 47:42.020
I give my baby little baby kisses, aren't cheek?

47:42.020 --> 47:42.500
Gross.

47:43.780 --> 47:47.460
And then I whisper to give her those ASMRs that babies love ASMR.

47:47.460 --> 47:49.060
Holy shit, no.

47:49.060 --> 47:50.500
Read another question.

47:50.500 --> 47:55.460
I've got an ASMR video of a woman giving her baby a massage.

47:55.460 --> 47:57.860
It's an infant massage ASMR video.

47:57.860 --> 47:59.940
Charlie loves it because it's got a baby in it.

47:59.940 --> 48:01.540
I love it because it's ASMR.

48:01.540 --> 48:03.700
It's a video we can all agree on.

48:03.700 --> 48:04.900
The whole family can like it.

48:04.900 --> 48:08.260
Hey, why don't you go ahead and airplay that from your phone to the Apple TV,

48:08.260 --> 48:11.140
dad, because the whole family is enjoying this ASMR video.

48:12.020 --> 48:14.100
I'm going to go throw you in jail, Justin.

48:14.980 --> 48:17.700
I'm calling the cops right now, and they're going to toss you in the pokey.

48:18.740 --> 48:20.260
They're going to try to toss me in the pokey.

48:20.260 --> 48:23.780
I'm going to be like, hey cops, thank you so much for putting the handcuffs on.

48:23.780 --> 48:26.180
Save it for the ASMR episode.

48:26.180 --> 48:28.820
They're going to get tangles, and they're not going to be able to arrest me.

48:28.820 --> 48:30.100
What a weird superpower.

48:30.660 --> 48:31.700
How about another question?

48:32.580 --> 48:33.300
Please.

48:33.300 --> 48:38.660
I live with my fiance, and although I have my own laptop, we share his desktop for gaming.

48:38.660 --> 48:41.700
He's a bit messy in real life, but that I can deal with.

48:41.700 --> 48:48.420
His computer is an issue though, because he saves his porn to the desktop.

48:48.980 --> 48:50.660
Oh, oh no.

48:52.020 --> 48:52.580
Oh no.

48:52.580 --> 48:53.940
Playing TF2 in Windows mode.

48:53.940 --> 48:56.180
To the desktop?

48:56.180 --> 48:59.140
I need instant access to Butt Slammers 21.

49:00.900 --> 49:02.020
I need it at the ready.

49:02.020 --> 49:04.340
I got it in my holster, my Butt Slammers holster.

49:04.340 --> 49:06.260
You never know when the moment's going to strike you.

49:08.420 --> 49:09.380
Hold on, let me finish the question.

49:10.100 --> 49:15.540
Playing TF2 in Windows mode with some asses staring right back is unsettling, I assure you.

49:16.180 --> 49:18.500
I've asked him to sort it, and he just laughs.

49:20.900 --> 49:23.140
It's not a deal breaker, it's just weird.

49:23.140 --> 49:27.540
Do I learn to live with it, or do I sort it myself for his upcoming birthday?

49:27.540 --> 49:32.420
Okay, that's from, there's no poor pun I can make about Eugene, Oregon.

49:32.420 --> 49:33.220
No, you can't.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.940
It's the un-porniest town in the world.

49:35.940 --> 49:40.740
I love the idea of, hey honey, could you sort the porn you've saved on your laptop?

49:42.020 --> 49:42.660
Okay, bye.

49:42.660 --> 49:44.180
Good joke, honey.

49:44.180 --> 49:44.900
Catch you later.

49:45.540 --> 49:48.660
From a, chase your bliss, stand your truth, whatever.

49:48.660 --> 49:52.420
From a taxonomy standpoint, sort your shit.

49:52.420 --> 49:53.460
I'm with this person.

49:54.020 --> 49:55.140
Sort your shit.

49:55.140 --> 49:56.420
Put your shit in a folder.

49:56.420 --> 49:58.100
Sort it.

49:58.100 --> 50:01.220
And name that folder, please don't look at this, this is my secret.

50:01.220 --> 50:03.140
Or just call it porn.

50:03.140 --> 50:05.540
But they'll just put it on the desktop.

50:06.100 --> 50:07.540
That's a cluttered desktop.

50:07.540 --> 50:08.820
It's obscuring your background.

50:08.820 --> 50:11.540
I don't save my audio files to my desktop.

50:11.540 --> 50:12.660
Why is your porn there?

50:14.580 --> 50:20.740
Yeah, and do you think it is large, okay, do you think it is large files he has downloaded

50:20.740 --> 50:24.580
and does not want to go through the time and trouble of downloading again?

50:24.580 --> 50:27.300
Or do you think we're talking about like hyperlinks?

50:27.300 --> 50:30.260
Like hyperlink files that get him right to the sites he craves?

50:31.380 --> 50:35.540
This is his go-to like never fail porn.

50:35.540 --> 50:40.260
Like even if he's having the worst day and maybe he's got like a cold and is running a fever,

50:40.260 --> 50:44.020
this is the porn that he knows is gonna work all the time, every time.

50:44.020 --> 50:46.340
And he doesn't want to lose those links.

50:46.340 --> 50:49.780
Or why is he downloading this stuff?

50:49.780 --> 50:56.500
Did he just like get kaza and was like, this is it, the pinnacle of technological achievement.

50:57.380 --> 50:58.420
It's just kaza.

50:58.420 --> 51:00.180
What is stream-iming?

51:00.180 --> 51:01.140
You mean streaming?

51:03.140 --> 51:07.140
If you are no longer available to access porn on the internet,

51:07.140 --> 51:09.940
everything else in society has collapsed around you.

51:09.940 --> 51:12.900
It will be, I guarantee you, the least of your worries.

51:12.900 --> 51:14.180
I can't keep reading.

51:14.180 --> 51:16.980
I keep, this person will put it in all caps.

51:16.980 --> 51:21.540
And for good reason, because that's how I am also reading it, which is screaming inside my own head.

51:22.260 --> 51:23.460
This shit, desktop.

51:23.460 --> 51:26.420
I would have been offended if it was any file.

51:26.420 --> 51:30.660
If he saved any file, like he saves this whole music library to his desktop, bad.

51:30.660 --> 51:34.900
He saves individual photos to his desktop, stop it.

51:34.900 --> 51:36.980
He saves GIFs of monkeys wearing hats.

51:38.180 --> 51:39.300
Nothing belongs on the desktop.

51:39.300 --> 51:41.620
I gotta say, actually, I'm being pretty hypocritical right now.

51:41.620 --> 51:45.060
I'd like to screen share my screen with the two of you boys right now.

51:45.060 --> 51:49.140
Just to enjoy sort of the screaming hellscape.

51:49.140 --> 51:51.060
Big bosom seven.

51:51.060 --> 51:53.220
No, stop, that doesn't, that's not out there.

51:53.940 --> 51:55.940
You have butt-slammers two, three, and-

51:55.940 --> 51:56.820
They didn't make a-

51:56.820 --> 52:01.060
Okay, well, we know your line because they didn't even make a butt-slammers three.

52:01.060 --> 52:01.780
They skipped it.

52:02.340 --> 52:07.140
This one's called thugs and jugs, which seems like almost kind of offensive, Griffin.

52:07.140 --> 52:08.980
Wait, did you say thugs in jugs?

52:08.980 --> 52:10.100
Thugs in jugs.

52:10.100 --> 52:10.660
No, it says-

52:10.660 --> 52:11.300
This is called-

52:11.300 --> 52:11.940
Please let them out.

52:11.940 --> 52:12.820
You're misreading that.

52:12.820 --> 52:16.420
It says jugs in jugs, it's about women who put their boobs into jugs?

52:16.420 --> 52:18.180
No, it says dugs in jugs.

52:19.220 --> 52:21.300
This one just says jugs in jugs.

52:21.300 --> 52:22.580
No, that's a bug's life.

52:24.740 --> 52:28.340
I got on Kazaa and I downloaded a rip of a bug's life, okay?

52:32.340 --> 52:36.660
There's some, it's kind of, okay, I wish I had the confidence

52:36.660 --> 52:41.140
and the self-assuredness and just the openness that this gentleman clearly has

52:41.140 --> 52:43.460
that they're like, I don't care, look at it.

52:43.460 --> 52:44.500
I don't care who knows.

52:44.500 --> 52:47.220
Everybody, everybody, come look what I masturbate to.

52:47.220 --> 52:49.620
It's not about that, Travis, it's about taxonomy.

52:50.180 --> 52:50.980
It's just-

52:51.860 --> 52:56.020
What if you did a two monitor set up and one monitor was just all porn,

52:56.020 --> 52:58.980
but the other one you kept suit, you had three icons in the whole thing.

52:59.780 --> 53:05.780
It was just Kazaa, Firefox, and I don't know, like chat, maroon, AIM.

53:07.140 --> 53:10.740
It's inconceivable.

53:10.740 --> 53:12.740
It's unimaginable.

53:12.740 --> 53:13.940
It's unimaginable.

53:15.700 --> 53:17.700
This computer's done.

53:17.700 --> 53:21.860
This is, no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade.

53:21.860 --> 53:22.900
Do your thing.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.580
It's just unthinkable to me.

53:24.580 --> 53:27.700
The storage solution that he has landed on.

53:29.140 --> 53:31.300
It's not a solution, it's anarchy.

53:31.300 --> 53:35.380
This is how jungle animals would save pornography on their desktop.

53:36.020 --> 53:37.620
Do you think they would use Safari?

53:37.620 --> 53:44.340
Travis, you piece of shit.

53:45.780 --> 53:46.820
How could you?

53:46.820 --> 53:48.820
I have one job on this podcast.

53:48.820 --> 53:49.460
No, it's good.

53:50.420 --> 53:53.540
I needed that because I was getting lost a little bit.

53:53.540 --> 53:54.340
Hey, I want to say-

53:55.220 --> 53:56.500
You should use Navigator.

53:56.500 --> 53:57.060
I want to say-

53:57.060 --> 53:58.180
You dick fish.

54:03.380 --> 54:06.580
I'm trying to, sorry, I didn't understand the last thing that you said.

54:06.580 --> 54:08.260
I feel like we're not communicating very well.

54:10.820 --> 54:11.780
I got another.

54:11.780 --> 54:13.300
Netscape communicator was another.

54:13.300 --> 54:15.300
Anyway, it's not as good as Navigator.

54:15.300 --> 54:17.940
Anyway, I want to say a big thank you to Nature Box.

54:17.940 --> 54:19.620
You can order hundreds of great tasting snacks.

54:19.620 --> 54:22.660
Go to naturebox.com for your first box of handpicked snacks.

54:22.660 --> 54:23.860
Send the rest to your doorstop.

54:24.900 --> 54:25.620
We got a lot of-

54:25.620 --> 54:27.860
After you go on a Safari, you're a real explorer.

54:29.220 --> 54:30.900
You're forcing it at this point.

54:30.900 --> 54:34.340
Okay, I'm going to double back on that one.

54:34.340 --> 54:35.060
Okay, that's good.

54:35.060 --> 54:36.900
That one, do over.

54:36.900 --> 54:37.700
Podcast do over.

54:38.420 --> 54:40.340
We got a lot of new shows that we're-

54:40.340 --> 54:43.460
Holy shit, so many new shows, so many new programs.

54:43.460 --> 54:46.580
I want to give a personal plug to two shows.

54:46.580 --> 54:48.020
One is called Still Buffering.

54:48.020 --> 54:53.540
It's a show about teenage life from my wife, Sydney, and her teenage sister, Riley.

54:54.180 --> 54:58.580
Much like Sawbones, it is appropriate for kids and parents.

54:58.580 --> 55:00.020
There's no bad words.

55:00.900 --> 55:03.220
And if you're looking for a show to listen to with your kids,

55:03.220 --> 55:05.540
I think it's a great one.

55:05.540 --> 55:07.060
I've listened to their second episode.

55:07.060 --> 55:09.700
It's about technology.

55:09.700 --> 55:13.860
And if you are an adult that wants to have a full-blown panic attack-

55:13.860 --> 55:14.340
Oh, boy.

55:14.340 --> 55:19.620
Please, please hear how Riley reacts to technological solutions

55:19.620 --> 55:21.540
that I still think of as fairly current.

55:22.260 --> 55:27.220
You'll also enjoy her horror at the description of what a chat room is and was.

55:27.220 --> 55:28.020
Oh, yeah.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.180
Yeah, because it's like not even a thing.

55:30.180 --> 55:31.540
But anyway, that's called Still Buffering.

55:31.540 --> 55:32.260
It's on iTunes.

55:32.260 --> 55:35.940
I also want to give a plug to a new show from Griffin.

55:36.500 --> 55:37.300
It's about video games.

55:37.300 --> 55:39.860
It's called Cool Games, Inc. that he does with Nick Robinson,

55:39.860 --> 55:43.860
who is another staffer at Polygon, the video game website that we make.

55:43.860 --> 55:48.580
And it is about Griffin and Nick coming up with video game ideas

55:48.580 --> 55:49.860
and then pitching them to someone.

55:49.860 --> 55:52.340
And it is uproariously funny.

55:52.340 --> 55:52.980
I can't recommend it.

55:52.980 --> 55:53.780
We have one episode.

55:53.780 --> 55:54.820
You can find it on iTunes.

55:56.100 --> 55:58.340
That's Cool Games, Inc.

55:58.340 --> 55:59.540
Cool Games, one word, Inc.

55:59.540 --> 56:03.380
And our first episode, we take tweets from people

56:03.380 --> 56:05.940
and we polish them into full game pitches.

56:05.940 --> 56:09.060
And our first episode is about a single tweet that we got

56:09.060 --> 56:11.700
from Ben Esposito from Arcane Kids,

56:11.700 --> 56:14.580
who made the amazing Sonic Dreams collection,

56:14.580 --> 56:16.180
which probably explains the tone of his tweet,

56:16.180 --> 56:18.260
which was grandma once hit al dente,

56:18.260 --> 56:22.420
which we then turned into a fucking goatee contender 2016.

56:23.460 --> 56:26.900
And did it let me also say that I really enjoy Rosebuddies,

56:26.900 --> 56:28.900
which is a show that Griffin and his wife

56:28.900 --> 56:30.180
do about The Bachelor.

56:30.180 --> 56:32.820
I've never watched an episode of Bachelor in my life

56:32.820 --> 56:34.900
and I thoroughly enjoy your Bachelor fan.

56:34.900 --> 56:35.140
Thank you.

56:35.140 --> 56:36.340
We get a lot of tweets from people saying,

56:36.340 --> 56:37.860
well, I enjoy this if I don't watch the show.

56:37.860 --> 56:39.860
And I literally, I love you.

56:39.860 --> 56:41.300
I have no idea how to answer that.

56:41.300 --> 56:43.620
That's like between you and your God.

56:44.900 --> 56:46.020
I also want to tell everybody,

56:46.020 --> 56:47.300
if you haven't checked it out yet,

56:47.300 --> 56:49.940
my wife and I just launched a podcast called Schmaners.

56:49.940 --> 56:51.940
It's all about etiquette in the modern age

56:51.940 --> 56:53.540
and whether or not it's still applicable

56:53.540 --> 56:55.940
and learn about stuff that you might not have known about.

56:55.940 --> 56:59.060
We've in our first week, we put up two episodes.

56:59.060 --> 57:01.140
So we have episode one, thank you notes,

57:01.140 --> 57:04.100
episode two table manners and episode three,

57:04.100 --> 57:06.420
which is gonna be coming up this Friday

57:06.420 --> 57:08.020
is conversational etiquette.

57:08.020 --> 57:09.380
So check it out.

57:10.100 --> 57:12.820
You can find it on iTunes and on maximumfund.org

57:12.820 --> 57:15.220

57:19.700 --> 57:21.220
for future episodes, tweet at us.

57:21.220 --> 57:22.500
It is the most delightful show.

57:22.500 --> 57:24.980
And I'm so glad that Teresa has a vehicle

57:24.980 --> 57:27.300
because as many people have commented,

57:27.300 --> 57:28.420
just a delightful voice.

57:29.220 --> 57:30.740
Just a wonderful, delightful voice.

57:30.740 --> 57:32.580
And just a delightful human being

57:32.580 --> 57:35.620
who really makes me seem personable and relatable.

57:35.620 --> 57:37.140
She makes you seem like fucking Shrek.

57:38.100 --> 57:38.900
That's fair.

57:38.900 --> 57:40.740
But people like Shrek, he's done like eight movies.

57:40.740 --> 57:41.780
That is true.

57:41.780 --> 57:43.140
He has a Broadway show.

57:43.140 --> 57:44.180
Do you have that?

57:44.180 --> 57:46.660
No, go listen to the other shows on Max Fun as well.

57:46.660 --> 57:48.500
There's a lot of very, very, very good ones.

57:49.620 --> 57:51.860
I'm talking about shows like stop podcasting yourself.

57:51.860 --> 57:55.060
I'm talking about shows like well, saw bones.

57:55.060 --> 57:56.020
We've already mentioned.

57:56.020 --> 57:57.780
I'm talking about like, can I pet your dog?

57:57.780 --> 57:59.140
I'm talking about one bad mother.

57:59.140 --> 58:00.740
You can find them all, maximumfund.org.

58:00.740 --> 58:01.380
Go check it out.

58:03.060 --> 58:04.900
You can also, we've mentioned a lot of projects

58:04.900 --> 58:05.700
that we're working on.

58:05.700 --> 58:06.980
If you wanna see all the projects

58:06.980 --> 58:08.980
we're associated with, including like stuff

58:08.980 --> 58:11.460
like the monster factory, Gervin's Amiibo Corner,

58:12.420 --> 58:14.580
all of our Facebook groups, all of our Twitter accounts,

58:14.580 --> 58:16.500
just go to mcroyshows.com.

58:16.500 --> 58:18.260
I also wanna say a very personal thank you

58:18.260 --> 58:21.060
to Jeremy Baker who hooked me up

58:21.060 --> 58:22.740
with some Disneyland passes.

58:22.740 --> 58:24.740
So I was able to take my friend.

58:24.740 --> 58:26.660
Yeah, I was able to take my friend Bradberry

58:26.660 --> 58:28.900
and my wife, Teresa, to Disneyland

58:28.900 --> 58:31.620
and we had just the most epic time.

58:31.620 --> 58:32.900
So thank you, Jeremy, for that.

58:34.100 --> 58:35.940
Oh, I also wanna say, just cause I'm trying to get the word

58:35.940 --> 58:38.580
out as often as possible so I can switch them over.

58:38.580 --> 58:41.860
I've got the new PO box set up, PO box 909,

58:41.860 --> 58:44.900
Van Nuys, California, 91408.

58:46.100 --> 58:48.100
The old one is still active

58:48.100 --> 58:50.180
but I probably won't keep it active forever.

58:50.180 --> 58:52.820
So if you're worried that you sent some stuff

58:52.820 --> 58:53.700
and it might not have got,

58:53.700 --> 58:55.220
we're still using that one for now.

58:55.860 --> 58:57.940
But if you have anything to send in the future,

58:57.940 --> 58:58.740
use the new one.

58:59.380 --> 59:02.100
And thanks, John Roderick and the Long Winters

59:02.100 --> 59:03.300
for the use of our theme song.

59:03.300 --> 59:05.940
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:05.940 --> 59:06.740
Please go listen.

59:06.740 --> 59:07.860
It's like the best album.

59:07.860 --> 59:08.340
It's a fucking great album.

59:08.340 --> 59:10.500
We listen to it once a month and it's so, so good.

59:10.500 --> 59:11.220
Finally, Yahoo.

59:12.420 --> 59:13.220
Yes.

59:13.220 --> 59:14.580

59:14.580 --> 59:15.940
I'm so ready.

59:15.940 --> 59:17.780

59:17.780 --> 59:18.420
Thank you, Brooks.

59:18.420 --> 59:22.980
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Raleigh H, who asks.

59:24.740 --> 59:25.940
Fuck, it's so good.

59:26.500 --> 59:30.180
Feminists, are you impressed that David Blaine

59:30.180 --> 59:32.580
held his breath for 17 minutes on Oprah?

59:34.500 --> 59:34.900
What?

59:34.900 --> 59:35.220
What?

59:35.220 --> 59:36.660

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.620
Hi, I'm Sydney McElroy.

And I'm Ryleigh Smurl.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.620
And we co-host a podcast called Still Buffering,

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.100
a sister's guide to teens through the ages.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.540
On our show, we tackle all of the hot teen topics

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.540
that kids have on their minds today.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.300
Hot teen topics?

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:27.380
Well, you know, the questions that are plaguing teenagers

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:30.100
through their tumultuous growing years.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.500
Questions like, how do I party?

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.380
Or what do I do with all this hair everywhere?

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.780
The same questions that people like Sydney

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.100
had during their years as teenagers.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.340
Many, many, many.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.300
Okay, not that many.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.140
So, so long ago.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.740
Yeah, okay, I think they get the idea.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.900
So search for Still Buffering on iTunes or Maximumfun.org

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.060

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.220
I am a teenager.

And I was too.
