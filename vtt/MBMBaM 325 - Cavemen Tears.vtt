00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:49.120
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.120 --> 00:53.200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.400
I'm that sweet baby brother that you crave, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.440
How's your guys' weekends? Do you have good weekends out there?

00:59.440 --> 01:06.320
I have been, I am taking 12 hours of birthing classes this weekend from 10 to 4 every day

01:06.880 --> 01:19.200
for the two days, and boys, that is a gushy situation. Gushy from Quantum Leap rolls up,

01:19.200 --> 01:22.320
and he's like, because he delivers every baby. That's the weird part.

01:22.320 --> 01:25.680
Wow. He must be busy. He's like Santa Claus.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.360
I'm just, I'm learning so much.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.000
About the miracle, Griffin? About the miracle?

01:32.960 --> 01:39.120
I mean, it is a miracle, right? The bodies do so much wonderful stuff to get it all going,

01:39.920 --> 01:45.600
but I was, I guess, ill-prepared for the amount of stuff I didn't know, and it made me think,

01:46.720 --> 01:54.000
I'm realizing now as I'm approaching 30 that I didn't pay very good attention in school,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.080
and I get these little realizations every day, and this was the first one where it was like,

01:58.080 --> 02:01.440
man, I didn't even pay attention in health class, because there's stuff I did not know,

02:01.440 --> 02:10.240
just sort of about how, like, where I originated from and grew and grew and blasted out of.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.840
There was one video birth, and I think there's another one coming today.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.880
They don't warn you. They just start it.

02:18.880 --> 02:24.480
They just, they hit play. It's like a jump scare. It's like a Five Nights at Freddy's situation.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.720
Do they at least put, like, a fun soundtrack, like Yackety Sax or something to it? Something

02:28.720 --> 02:33.440
where it's like, hey, we know how, you know, intense this can be. We're gonna soften it just

02:33.440 --> 02:41.520
a little bit. They play his much less popular Yuckety Sax. Yucky. Yuckety sucks. You know what?

02:43.360 --> 02:47.680
I think rather than Yackety Sax, I think, like, Careless Whisper would be better. I think I'd

02:47.680 --> 02:54.080
rather, like, have just some smooth, like, baritone sax playing along with it to make it seem like,

02:54.080 --> 02:57.120
yeah, this is a smooth, non-intense, non-terrifying moment.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.160
Did you make it born to be wild and then perhaps

03:01.200 --> 03:04.880
some sunglasses over the baby as they come out?

03:04.880 --> 03:10.560
And the baby comes out giving the okay sign saying, it's cool, dad. Don't even worry.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.840
That would be tricky because it would require you to find the face

03:13.840 --> 03:17.120
on whatever it is that comes out of there first.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.960
Before they mold it into a baby.

03:19.840 --> 03:25.760
What they don't tell you is you don't, you can't love what comes out initially until about 15

03:25.760 --> 03:31.920
minutes before you can love it. People say the moment that baby was born, my entire life changed.

03:31.920 --> 03:37.040
And that's true because you immediately feel like you're in a life or death situation,

03:37.680 --> 03:42.000
face hugger coming at you, and you're looking around the room for, like, stray torches

03:42.000 --> 03:46.400
or something like that, pepper spray, something to defend yourself from this creature.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.400
There was this awesome couple that was sitting next to us in the class yesterday

03:50.400 --> 03:54.240
who the instructor was talking about how they go, like, birth to, like,

03:54.240 --> 03:58.240
straight to skin to skin, like, they get it on mama's chest, like, immediately.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.800
And there was one woman who was like, I don't want that.

04:03.680 --> 04:08.400
Wipe that thing down. I do not want all of that goo on me. No, thanks.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.640
Wipe it down. Thank you.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.000
The video we watched, real quick, this is a true thing.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.760
Like, what we focused on a lot yesterday was, like, different positions you can get into,

04:17.760 --> 04:22.320
like, relieve pain, but there were also different birthing positions.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.400
This I did not know. I thought we had figured out sort of the best way to do this,

04:26.400 --> 04:30.000
and it was, like, on the back, legs up, blast off.

04:30.560 --> 04:37.920
No, because the video we watched, the birth was an all fours situation,

04:37.920 --> 04:46.240
and it must have been effective because that baby just like, just like, just like blasted out of

04:46.240 --> 04:53.920
there like it was a t-shirt cannon. It was the craziest shit I've ever, ever, ever seen.

04:53.920 --> 04:58.160
I'm not squeamish, and I'm not, like, childish about birth. I do think it's beautiful.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.040
This was a new sort of thing for me because it was just like,

05:01.040 --> 05:06.640
clip-a-plio. Griffin, you can read about all the different birthing positions in the Mamasutra.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.120
I can't with that. I fucking can't. It's 9 a.m.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.560
Because it's like commas, but it's like the mama because it's like a mother.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.600
I don't think I can't. No, you don't think we can't because it's actually a perversion of,

05:18.240 --> 05:22.880
of, like, a nice thing. They, I actually... I mean, Kama Sutra can be a nice thing.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.760
Yeah, it can be very nice if done properly.

05:25.760 --> 05:34.160
Yeah, we actually are supposed to give it, like, give that baby to earth just, like,

05:34.160 --> 05:40.880
squatting. I say wait. People capable of having babies biologically are supposed to just squat

05:40.880 --> 05:45.120
and let that baby just, like, pop right out. They didn't invent laying on your back until, like,

05:45.920 --> 05:51.600
the 1300s or something like that. I guess moms, I guess moms just, just got lazy.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.040
Moms know what I'm saying. No, from what I understand,

05:53.040 --> 05:57.040
it's actually, like, they did the laying on the back to make it easier for doctors to get in there

05:57.040 --> 06:00.880
so they didn't have to, like, squat. The doctor was like, I'd rather just sit on a stool. Could

06:00.880 --> 06:04.320
you lay down, please? Yeah, what's the doctor do if mama's squatting? Does the doctor just

06:04.320 --> 06:09.200
lay down on the floor? No, this is silly. No, he's got a giant, like, giant catcher's mitt.

06:10.160 --> 06:16.240
Or, like, a net situation. We covered this at Max Funcon in Sydney's birthing class,

06:16.240 --> 06:20.720
and Griffin, I'm assuming you just didn't really key in there. You're kind of assuming that

06:20.720 --> 06:27.600
other people would halo for you, huh? I took a nap. I missed that class on Forch. Fair enough.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.360
Let's get into the shit, huh? I mean, I'm already definitely in the shit, and literally,

06:33.360 --> 06:36.800
as soon as we wrap this, I'm gonna hop in the shower and then go back for six more hours of

06:37.360 --> 06:46.160
pu-pu-plow. Have they covered the fact that, um, most, most, um, poop? Oh, yeah. Okay, good,

06:46.160 --> 06:52.480
good, good, good. But I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it. Well, actually, Justin, like,

06:52.480 --> 06:56.960
all women poop, but just some of them do it during childbirth. Okay, here's our first question.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.520
This is, this is... Actually, sorry, there was a guy, there was a guy who asked about that. He's

07:01.520 --> 07:06.080
like, at what point do I need to be afraid of getting shat on, he said, and his choice is,

07:06.080 --> 07:10.240
well, I found it very distasteful, and his wife was very embarrassed, and the woman leaving the

07:10.240 --> 07:16.240
house is like, 99.9 women, percent of women, like, do it, and I saw in his face a brief

07:16.240 --> 07:21.520
moment of relief, like, all right, baby, something to, something to aspire to. Be that one in a

07:21.520 --> 07:28.160
thousand. When you introduce yourself to someone and they call you the wrong name or decide that

07:28.160 --> 07:33.920
they get to shorten it, like shorten Jeffrey to Jeff, exactly how many times can you correct them

07:33.920 --> 07:40.480
without being a big old jerk? Like, at what point does Mel or Melody just become my name?

07:42.000 --> 07:48.480
Wait. We should make it clear, her name is Melanie. Oh, okay, I was gonna say, well, Melody,

07:48.480 --> 07:53.920
if your name's Melody, that, the die is cast. My name is Jeff, my name is Jeff. Hi, Melody.

07:53.920 --> 08:00.560
No, no, it's wrong. That's from just call me whatever. I would like to give a pretty

08:00.560 --> 08:05.680
laissez-faire attitude towards it, if that's your name. I would like to pose, like, a very

08:05.680 --> 08:13.200
non-McRoy answer. Okay. The first time it happens, look them square in the eye, and not in a jerky

08:13.200 --> 08:21.040
way, but just in a very clear, like, just say, no, actually, it's Melanie. Period. The end.

08:21.040 --> 08:26.080
That's such a hard one, especially over the phone, where the phone, there's like six letters,

08:26.080 --> 08:31.680
the phone, whoever invented it, I guess Alexander Graham Bell, they were like, his assistant was

08:31.680 --> 08:39.280
like, hey, Alex, do we need this thing to, like, recognize n's and m's and d's and t's?

08:40.480 --> 08:46.880
And Alex was like, no, no, no, people will figure it out. Anyways, it's 420, I gotta go. Anyway,

08:46.880 --> 08:54.480
I gotta blaze it. That was the first recording. 420, time to blaze. At the tone, it's time to

08:54.480 --> 09:03.840
blaze it. I'm sorry, I just, there's just not a world in which I would ever correct someone for

09:03.840 --> 09:10.000
this. There's just not a, cause like, think about the payoff for this, right? You let the person

09:10.000 --> 09:14.080
call whatever you want, cause in the end, it doesn't really matter that much, like, you know

09:14.080 --> 09:18.800
what they're doing, like, you know who they want, you know they wanna get hold of you, so let them

09:18.800 --> 09:24.320
do whatever they're gonna do. Names are for other people to get a hold of you, so like, if they

09:24.320 --> 09:28.560
use the wrong name, like, whatever, it doesn't matter. As long as it doesn't create confusion,

09:28.560 --> 09:32.720
fine. And then they'll do it for long enough that eventually, they're gonna do it in front of

09:32.720 --> 09:40.000
someone that knows you better than they do, and it will be the fucking greatest payoff. Like,

09:41.040 --> 09:45.840
really? I feel so different, Jamie. No, that's good shit, Travis. No, no, no, you're fucking,

09:46.480 --> 09:50.560
like, you'll turn around and they'll look at you and it'll be like the fucking end of

09:50.560 --> 09:55.440
the usual suspects. This whole time? This whole time? But I've had that happen to me.

09:56.400 --> 10:01.040
The person found out they were using the wrong name, and the look they gave me was like I'd been

10:01.040 --> 10:07.520
grifting them the whole time to set them up for this moment. Yeah, no shit. It's called, like,

10:07.520 --> 10:13.760
a kindness grift, because you are such, like, a good and generous person that cared so much about

10:13.760 --> 10:17.200
upsetting them that you let them call you whatever you want, cause it doesn't really matter that much

10:17.200 --> 10:21.360
anyway, and then they're going to feel bad about it forever. You know, like, you show up at work the

10:21.360 --> 10:26.640
next day, oh, what's this on my desk? Is this a fresh baked pie with the crisscross thing on the

10:26.640 --> 10:32.320
top? Delicious. I'm so glad I let you call me the wrong thing for so long. But the other side of

10:32.320 --> 10:37.040
that is like, hey, has anybody seen Jerry? Oh, he quit. What? Yeah, he felt so bad for calling you

10:37.040 --> 10:43.200
Trevor for the last six months. He just couldn't show his face anymore. He moved to another

10:43.200 --> 10:49.040
country. He's a monk now. It's crazy. But what if the inverse happens and they let it go until you

10:49.040 --> 10:55.840
quit, and then, like, as you're leaving the person finds out, like, your name was what the whole time?

10:55.840 --> 11:01.920
Or they don't even make a big deal out of it. They go up to you and they're like, see you later. Have

11:02.640 --> 11:07.440
happy trails, Nathan. And it's like, wait, this whole time you actually knew?

11:07.440 --> 11:11.520
So many different griffs you can pull on the name thing. Justin, I would argue that you have,

11:11.520 --> 11:17.120
it sounds like you have a fairly laissez-faire attitude towards name truncation and wrongness,

11:17.120 --> 11:24.240
because your name is impossible to either get wrong or shorten. Except for, except for Dustin.

11:24.240 --> 11:29.680
But guess what? Nobody's named Dustin. That's a prank. That's actually incorrect, because I get

11:29.680 --> 11:39.040
Jason free. I had a theater professor that called me Jason exclusively for basically all four years

11:39.040 --> 11:45.760
of college. Not exclusively, but a considerable amount. It doesn't bother me. My great-grandmother

11:45.760 --> 11:53.120
called me Jason some. It's just like, I don't care. I don't care. That name is missing so many sort of

11:53.120 --> 11:59.840
word experiences that Justin has in it. It's missing, it's missing so many fun notes.

11:59.840 --> 12:09.200
The key to happiness from what I have gathered, a big part of it is being able to let go of ego.

12:09.200 --> 12:15.280
And like to me, being worried about what people are calling you is like the personification of ego.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.600
Like it just, it does not matter.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.880
Well, for some of us-

12:18.880 --> 12:19.680
It just doesn't matter.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.240
What?

12:20.240 --> 12:24.720
Well, for some of us, ego has been what we've shaped our entire life around, Justin.

12:24.720 --> 12:29.600
Well, it's a, trust me, that's a rickety bridge, man. You got to maybe check the supports on that one,

12:29.600 --> 12:32.720
on that whole worldview. You can be a rickety bridge.

12:32.720 --> 12:37.040
Travis also seems impossible to get, Travis seems impossible to get wrong too.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.360
I've been called Trevor, Tarvis.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.800
I've been called Tarvis, Targus, Targus.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.560
The worst is when people try to make it like Travy, fuck it.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.200
The worst is when people try to make it like Travy, fucking hate that.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.240
Oh, that won't do.

12:52.240 --> 12:57.120
It's just like an infantilization of my name. I'm a 32 year old man.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.920
When I call restaurants and I place orders,

13:02.640 --> 13:07.520
do you guys want to guess what name they put down for me when they don't get it right?

13:07.520 --> 13:08.960
And this is not a goof.

13:08.960 --> 13:14.400
The name, I would say maybe 50, 50, 50% people hear Griffin and they say,

13:14.400 --> 13:19.680
oh, I've heard that name before, the other half.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.480
Anybody want to guess?

13:21.680 --> 13:22.240
Jeffin.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.200
No, Kristen, Kristen.

13:26.080 --> 13:26.640
Kristen?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.360
Hello, yes, this is Kristen.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Egg rolls, please. A hundred of them.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.920
Kristen has an egg roll size hole in her belly, please.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.760
Oh, this is a good little segue.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.160
This Yahoo was sent by Eric Woods. Thank you, Eric.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.960
It's Yahoo Answers user. Sorry, something's gone wrong.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.680
Do a quick refresh of the page, see if we can't get the data to load.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.680
And no, unfortunately it's still wrong.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.560
It's from Kristen.

13:51.600 --> 13:58.240
My alter ego asks, can you legally have a number in your name?

13:58.880 --> 14:01.600
For example, if you are the fourth Peter in your family,

14:01.600 --> 14:03.840
can you legally be called Peter four?

14:03.840 --> 14:11.360
Now, not Peter the fourth, Peter four.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.240
Peter four.

14:12.240 --> 14:12.880
Petty four.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.280
Can you legally have a number in your name?

14:16.080 --> 14:16.640
It depends.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.920
Are you talking about, like, the number is pronounced?

14:20.720 --> 14:24.720
Like, could you put an eight in there and just have that,

14:24.720 --> 14:29.040
like, you know, pronounced as part of the pronunciation?

14:29.920 --> 14:32.960
Oh, like if your name was-

14:32.960 --> 14:34.960
Kate, and it was just like K-8.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.320
Damn.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.320
Damn, like, kind of give you, namely, a license play vibe.

14:40.320 --> 14:44.800
I'm saying you could do, like, Caitlin and just like K-8-L-Y-N.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.160
Okay, but seriously now, can you put a number in your name?

14:48.160 --> 14:49.680
Can you do that, though, for real, though?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.600
Because they're characters.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.440
They're on a keyboard.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.080
Yeah.

14:54.080 --> 14:54.800
The government.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.320
I mean, the government on this one.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.360
Do you think that they're so-

14:57.360 --> 14:58.400
Okay, picture this.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.960
Honey, she's beautiful.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.760
I think we're gonna go with Kristen Four.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.400
No, shut it down.

15:06.400 --> 15:06.640
What?

15:07.520 --> 15:08.640
How'd you get in here?

15:08.640 --> 15:09.840
I'm with the government.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.000
You can't put a number in that baby's name.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.200
It's Kristen the Fourth.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.400
Now get out of the hospital.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.680
We need it for somebody else.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
One of the nurses in the birthing class yesterday

15:18.960 --> 15:22.640
said they had a baby named Absid, which was literally A-B-C-D.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.360
Slam dunk.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.280
Crushed it.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.160
I like that.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.280
That's really good.

15:27.280 --> 15:27.760
What about Peter?

15:27.760 --> 15:28.720
It is important.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.240
When we were trying to come up with baby names,

15:30.240 --> 15:32.240
we had the thought of what's a name that you could pick

15:32.240 --> 15:35.360
that you couldn't turn into anything else

15:35.360 --> 15:36.880
and that no one's used before.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.360
Absid's pretty good.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.400
Absid's pretty good, yeah.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.160
Peter, I like this.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.240
I like the idea of if you have a Peter

15:45.360 --> 15:49.920
and you could do a shitty video game branding convention

15:49.920 --> 15:53.040
where there's a game series called Thief,

15:53.040 --> 15:53.920
the third Thief game.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.080
It was T-H-I-3-F.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.160
Oh, god.

15:58.160 --> 15:58.800
I forgot that.

15:58.800 --> 16:02.080
Thief, I think you just throw a three.

16:02.080 --> 16:06.000
If you're the third Peter, you can be Pthreeter.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.000
I'm Pthreeter.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.280
That's a tight ass name, too.

16:09.280 --> 16:09.760
I like that.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.440
Yeah, Pthreeter.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.480
But we know that they're the fourth.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.920
You gotta get a four in there somewhere.

16:15.920 --> 16:16.480
You're right.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.760
Pthorder.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.480
Pthorder.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.720
It's pronounced Peter, but it says Pthorder.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.120
I know.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.800
I know what it says.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.760
It's my fucking name.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.200
You think I don't know what it says?

16:27.200 --> 16:28.800
My dad Pthreeter named me.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.440
But we have a thing.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.920
The parallel that they draw is a weird example

16:37.920 --> 16:39.840
because we have a thing for that.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.600
We have a way to put numbers if you're the third or fourth

16:43.600 --> 16:45.040
Peter in your family.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.440
We have one of those.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.240
Does it have to be a direct line of succession

16:50.240 --> 16:52.080
in order to justify that, though?

16:52.080 --> 16:54.000
Can you just be like, this is the fourth time

16:54.000 --> 16:55.840
we couldn't come up with anything better than Peter,

16:55.840 --> 16:58.400
so here it is presenting Peter.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.960
Justin, this is the classic James Bond,

17:00.960 --> 17:02.800
James Bond Jr. conundrum.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.440
Because James Bond Jr. was not James Bond's son.

17:06.160 --> 17:06.560
Wait, what?

17:06.560 --> 17:07.600
But rather his nephew.

17:08.240 --> 17:08.480
No.

17:09.200 --> 17:09.440
Yeah.

17:10.080 --> 17:10.320
No.

17:11.280 --> 17:11.520
Yeah.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.720
No, I'm saying you're not wrong.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.120
I'm saying no to just the whole thing.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.240
I think even like Blofeld was like,

17:20.240 --> 17:22.240
wait, that's not how that fucking works.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.240
You can't do that.

17:24.240 --> 17:28.320
How did they justify that in the canon of James Bond Jr.?

17:28.320 --> 17:29.680
His parents were real lazy.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.280
Also, James Bond doesn't have a brother.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.160
Wait, hold on.

17:34.160 --> 17:34.880
Hold on.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.720
Hold on, James Bond Jr. series.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.200
James Bond doesn't have a brother or sister.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.280
Lot of holes.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.240
They had to have like dealt with that, right?

17:48.240 --> 17:48.740
Right?

17:50.000 --> 17:50.560
Hold on.

17:51.120 --> 17:51.840
Hold on.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.440
Why don't I know the answer to that?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.400
I watched every episode.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.560
Maybe it was just a young James Bond.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.240
No, he was related.

17:58.880 --> 17:59.360
Damn it.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.840
Did James Bond ever roll up on the cartoon show James Bond Jr.?

18:03.840 --> 18:07.680
And he was like, make sure you shoot them right in the brain.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.560
Anyway, time to go fuck.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.680
It's like, whoa, damn.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.080
Have some gin.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.120
But I'm 12.

18:15.120 --> 18:15.680
I can't.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.560
I can't have gin.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.240
I don't care.

18:19.040 --> 18:19.440
Drink it.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.840
No, okay, I don't have any idea.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.040
Like it is not covered and also no one.

18:27.040 --> 18:27.540
Okay.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.920
The son of David Bond.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.640
Hello, I'm Dave Bond.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.840
Hey, I'm Dave Bond.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.040
What are you naming your son?

18:35.040 --> 18:35.840
David Jr.?

18:36.480 --> 18:38.480
Well, James, actually, it's funny.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.440
You should ask.

18:39.440 --> 18:45.920
I got this is gonna come off a little weird, but his name is James Bond Jr.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.440
What are you talking about?

18:47.440 --> 18:48.320
Crikey.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.760
This is my new British accent.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.080
Yeah.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.840
Well, I just thought, you want him?

18:55.120 --> 18:55.620
What?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.280
It's funny that we're talking about this because I've actually

18:59.280 --> 19:00.560
wanted to talk to you boys about this.

19:00.560 --> 19:04.640
I think I'm gonna name my son Justin Travis McElroy Jr.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.400
So is that, are we good?

19:08.400 --> 19:08.960
Are we good?

19:09.520 --> 19:10.400
Am I good?

19:10.400 --> 19:13.360
Honestly, can I just tweet that out real quick?

19:13.360 --> 19:14.640
Because I'm like so honored by it.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.920
Uh, maybe sit on the tweet.

19:17.920 --> 19:24.160
We're waiting for the social, our social media manager, Bryson, to work up a package.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.920
Can I read just one sentence from the James Bond Jr. Wikipedia page?

19:29.920 --> 19:32.640
Oh, Travis, that's the rest of the episode.

19:33.280 --> 19:37.760
Alternatively, it has been proposed that Fleming's James Bond had a brother

19:37.760 --> 19:41.600
also named James Bond, who is the father of James Bond Jr.

19:41.600 --> 19:48.480
Alternately, it was proposed by an idiot, a popular, well-known idiot with a platform.

19:49.280 --> 19:49.920
What the fuck?

19:50.560 --> 19:52.560
These are my son, James.

19:52.560 --> 19:52.880
What?

19:54.080 --> 20:00.080
And his friend's IQ, the grandson of Q, not how that naming convention works either.

20:00.640 --> 20:05.040
And his friend Gordo Lighter, the son of Felix Lighter.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.680
This show is whack.

20:07.680 --> 20:12.320
I'm James, this is my dad, David Bond, and my best friend Gordo.

20:13.520 --> 20:17.920
I'm the creator of this show has never seen James Bond movies before in action.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.440
He chases scum around the world.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.040
That's the only thing I remember about James Bond Jr. character.

20:23.040 --> 20:23.920
How about another question?

20:24.560 --> 20:26.320
Yeah, here it comes.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.760
And Goldfinger has a teenage daughter named Goldy Finger.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.640
What the fuck?

20:30.640 --> 20:31.120
That's gross.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.400
That's like not great.

20:33.200 --> 20:33.760
Oh no.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.920
That's really not actually excellent.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.960
Enjoy high school, Goldy Finger.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.760
Oh no.

20:41.760 --> 20:42.000
No.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.400
So you're really naming, I'm really naming her that.

20:49.200 --> 20:53.040
But you understand that, yes, I've looked through all of it.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.880
I know exactly what it means, yes.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.840
I know what I'm doing.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.680
Goldfinger, do you not remember what high school was like?

20:59.680 --> 21:01.200
Yes, it was awesome.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.920
It was awesome.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.080
No, I remember exactly.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.720
I wanted to grow up strong.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.480
Also, Goldfinger was his fucking last name.

21:13.360 --> 21:13.760
Yeah.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.080
His name was Arik Goldfinger.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.200
You can't name your daughter Goldy Finger.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.040
They're really playing fast and loose in the James Bond Jr. writers room.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.280
So stupid, okay.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.080
So stupid.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.120
All right, here's a question.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.000
God, I'm too mad.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.000
Oh boy.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.600
When I use the stall at work, some office prankster likes to come in and use an app

21:35.600 --> 21:37.680
on their phone to create fart noises.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.160
Pretty good.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.120
Then when they have finished, they leave, turning out the light.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.720
How do I get them to stop this?

21:44.720 --> 21:47.680
Please help me bring peace and quiet back to the bathroom.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.360
That's from Disturbing Detroit.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.240
And fucking obviously this is camouflage.

21:52.240 --> 21:57.680
They're obviously socially uncomfortable with the idea that someone is listening to them

21:57.680 --> 22:02.400
do the damn thing and they have created, they have probably not created.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.040
They probably just downloaded this app to help them.

22:05.040 --> 22:08.720
No, they develop their own fart piano.

22:08.720 --> 22:13.600
They still can valid up a new program to fart when they fart.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.560
There's a lot of sensors.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.360
Are you making any kind of, maybe they're turning off the light.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.040
They don't even know you're there.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.800
No, they always, they do it every time.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.480
Then they're Jamie fucking Kennedy.

22:22.480 --> 22:26.480
Meaning they're Jamie Kennedy Jr.

22:27.840 --> 22:34.000
I just like, can we just do this question and never deal with it again?

22:34.000 --> 22:37.920
And then like, maybe this will be our first viral thing where it gets picked up.

22:37.920 --> 22:49.440
And our message can just be like, in the bathroom, keep it cool in the toilet area.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.400
Yeah, just like get in.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.440
How many questions do we get?

22:53.440 --> 22:54.640
Like people try to talk to me.

22:54.640 --> 23:00.080
People just get in, do the damn thing and get the fuck out.

23:02.240 --> 23:07.360
This is the crazy, this is the most, it's a place where you make yourself vulnerable

23:07.360 --> 23:10.240
and then you do the dirtiest thing you do.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.760
Can we not do a tight five in there?

23:13.760 --> 23:17.280
And also literally everyone fucking does it.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.040
So this idea of like, I'm uncomfortable in the bathroom.

23:21.040 --> 23:26.000
Like this jokester who's in there pranking you and turning off the lights.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.720
They're also doing stuff in the bathroom.

23:28.720 --> 23:32.080
Why can't we all have a little bit of human compassion for one another

23:32.080 --> 23:36.560
and recognize that the thing we're doing is in many ways the worst.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.880
See, human compassion does not fit.

23:38.880 --> 23:47.040
Okay, to me, the bathroom is the break room from being a human being.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.640
I have seen people I've known my entire life in the bathroom

23:53.440 --> 23:57.600
and we have let it pass without any hint of acknowledgement.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.720
I've been in like at an event where I've ended up in the bathroom

24:00.720 --> 24:02.400
at the same time as a famous person.

24:02.400 --> 24:07.360
They are not, to me, it's not like I'm polite and I just, no, they're not.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.880
They're not a person right then.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.680
None of us are people.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.920
We're taking a break from society right now.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.600
We're like, we don't have to interact.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.800
We don't have to do anything.

24:14.800 --> 24:20.560
It's a sacred time of not fucking talking or looking at each other, period, the end.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.800
I took a piss next to Paul Simon once.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.440
He may as well have been a stack of shoe boxes.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.720
I don't give a fuck.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.240
Mine's Lou Diamond Phillips.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.640
And he might as well have been a picture of Lou Diamond Phillips

24:30.640 --> 24:32.640
just on the urinal next to me.

24:32.640 --> 24:37.600
Now, can we take a moment and figure out why that picture was hung up?

24:38.960 --> 24:42.560
Enjoy this LDP while you do your LDP.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.040
Low down dirty poop.

24:46.160 --> 24:46.800
God.

24:49.520 --> 24:56.640
Yeah, just we are all just primitive boxes in there.

24:56.640 --> 25:02.560
We are all just, we are just husks doing our caveman stuff.

25:03.360 --> 25:08.480
Please don't, the ladder of awful things you can do is like,

25:08.480 --> 25:12.880
it starts with innocuous stuff like don't hand out mints in there.

25:12.880 --> 25:17.600
I'm sorry that somebody either hired you or invited you to do this,

25:17.600 --> 25:22.560
but it is a trespass upon me and my safe space.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.480
Oh, I have a money making scheme for that.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.280
Just encourage me.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.160
Stand outside the bathroom door and everybody who walks in

25:28.160 --> 25:29.760
tell them if you don't give me a dollar,

25:29.760 --> 25:30.560
I'm gonna come in there and hand out mints.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.760
I'm gonna go in there with you.

25:35.920 --> 25:40.240
Could we, oh man, guys, oh man, guys.

25:41.040 --> 25:41.600
What?

25:41.600 --> 25:43.360
Here's a money making idea.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.880
You walk into the bathroom.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.120
What's the first thing you see on your left?

25:49.120 --> 25:52.720
It's a rack full of Phantom of the Opera masks.

25:52.720 --> 25:57.040
You throw one of those little, you throw one of those bad boys on

25:57.040 --> 25:58.720
or maybe you bring your own from home

25:58.720 --> 26:00.480
and then you can have your own sort of, well, no,

26:00.480 --> 26:01.440
you can't bring your own from home.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.520
It has to be, it has to promise anonymity.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.920
All of these beautiful masquerade masks.

26:05.920 --> 26:09.040
Turn every, turn every bathroom into eyes wide shut.

26:09.680 --> 26:09.920
Yeah.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.200
Except that it's literally like we're pretending

26:13.200 --> 26:15.600
like all of our eyes are just shut.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.720
It's just eyes shut.

26:17.440 --> 26:22.240
God, I mean, if we could, if we could figure out a way to like,

26:22.240 --> 26:24.640
okay, another solution is you walk into the bathroom

26:24.640 --> 26:26.400
and there's blindfolds and you put those on

26:26.400 --> 26:29.200
and then there's like a string that you follow

26:29.200 --> 26:32.640
to either, you know, Browntown or to either,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.200
which of the different toilets there are.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.720
Maybe, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.360
Another money making idea, bathroom bouncer.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.160
Okay, okay.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.920
And they've got like a rope and they're like,

26:45.920 --> 26:48.800
now we're at capacity, gotta wait till someone else comes out.

26:48.800 --> 26:48.960
Yeah.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.240
That kind of, you know, and it's also,

26:50.240 --> 26:51.440
that's gotta make it feel cool.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.160
And then if somebody flips off the light and he's like,

26:54.160 --> 26:57.280
oh no, you're not allowed back at the bathroom ever again.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.200
In any bathroom.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.960
In any bathroom, I'm gonna spread the word.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.320
I have a, we, we, when we were shooting our TV show,

27:04.320 --> 27:08.560
there was a, there was probably 20 people,

27:08.560 --> 27:10.800
I would guess working on it at the same time

27:10.800 --> 27:14.400
in one building that had one toilet to spare.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.200
So basically anytime you went to use the bathroom,

27:17.200 --> 27:19.840
you were doing like the knob turn,

27:19.840 --> 27:24.480
oh, there's like knock occupied and then having to move away.

27:24.480 --> 27:29.040
My question is, how far do you have to move away?

27:30.080 --> 27:33.600
Do you guys do the thing where you move away so far

27:33.600 --> 27:37.440
that you couldn't conceivably have been the mystery knocker?

27:37.440 --> 27:40.160
The person who is like, like I've gone so far

27:40.160 --> 27:43.120
as to like look around as though I've just seen the person

27:43.120 --> 27:46.480
that knocked on them, like get away from me again.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.400
Like I was trying to get tabs on him.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.960
Like, well, he went that way boss, go get him.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.880
Oh yeah, he ran right through you.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.800
He's dressed like a real perv.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.480
When they walk out of the bathroom,

27:56.480 --> 27:58.800
I am on my phone making a fake phone call.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.280
And as they walk by me, I'll say something like,

28:01.280 --> 28:03.360
it's been so nice talking to you for 20 minutes.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.040
I will often do a full pantomimus though.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.800
I've just realized I need to go to the right,

28:08.800 --> 28:10.880
even if no one else is around, just in case.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.280
Like it's sort of like, oh, were you just in the bathroom?

28:13.280 --> 28:16.080
You know, now that you mentioned it, I could bathroom.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.360
Yeah, I could go.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.400
Yeah, oh, cause there's nothing worse than like,

28:20.400 --> 28:24.960
they walk out and I have just through contrivances

28:24.960 --> 28:27.360
and situations that befall us all,

28:27.360 --> 28:29.920
have been too close to the bathroom after that.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.200
And then when the person comes out,

28:31.200 --> 28:32.640
they're like, it's all yours.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.000
Like the worst.

28:34.000 --> 28:34.640
No, I don't.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.520
What did you do?

28:35.520 --> 28:37.120
What did you do to prepare it for me?

28:37.120 --> 28:39.200
What ceremony is prepared?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.960
This is not, yeah, this is not like a giant robot

28:42.960 --> 28:44.080
that you've been piloting

28:44.080 --> 28:45.920
that I am now taking on the legacy of.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.880
This is a toilet that we use for shame.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.240
Justin, use my mech.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.320
You have to, you have to finish the fight.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.360
That's a good thing to say.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.240
Finish the fight.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.240
Finish the fight, bro.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.520
This one's for all of us.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.800
This is a good opportunity for me

28:58.800 --> 29:00.080
to have a little press conference for you,

29:00.080 --> 29:02.480
my two brothers, because Justin was not joking.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.040
We had one toilet for all 20 of us

29:05.040 --> 29:07.440
for three weeks while we were shooting the show.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.680
And at one point the toilet seat broke.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.880
It came off the hinge

29:10.880 --> 29:12.960
and was just kind of a free floating situation.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.320
And ladies and gentlemen,

29:14.320 --> 29:15.920
thank you for gathering here today.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.200
It is with much sorrow that I admit

29:19.200 --> 29:21.120
that I was the one who did break the toilet seat

29:22.080 --> 29:22.960
for everybody.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.400
And I never admitted it

29:24.960 --> 29:26.960
and nobody ever fixed the toilet seat.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.160
We did get another toilet seat

29:28.160 --> 29:29.760
and I thought like, boy, I broke it.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.640
I should really take it on myself to put it on there.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.840
But here's the thing.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.480
I used my foot to open and close toilet lids

29:36.480 --> 29:39.040
because I'm not some sort of wild animal.

29:39.040 --> 29:44.640
And I guess I did like sort of a hard bicycle kick

29:44.640 --> 29:48.720
and it disrupted the machinery.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.400
And so I apologize

29:50.400 --> 29:52.480
and I hope that we can all come together

29:52.480 --> 29:53.680
as a country to find a way forward.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.400
Thank you very much.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.360
No questions at this time.

29:57.360 --> 30:09.360
All right, let's let the healing begin in the money zone.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.560
Do you guys wanna know what I had for dinner last night?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.480
Not especially.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.080
Yes, I do.

30:18.080 --> 30:23.520
In great detail, pan-seared cod.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.000
Slower.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.920
With udon noodles served in a-

30:27.920 --> 30:29.840
That is not how that word is pronounced,

30:29.840 --> 30:31.120
even close to it.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.600
Udon, ayudon noodles.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.640
No, I'm not Don.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.160
Thank you for asking though.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.760
Ayudon noodles.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.840
I'm Dizerone.

30:39.840 --> 30:45.440
Shiitake broth and some very other good flavors

30:45.440 --> 30:47.600
to enjoy with a relish.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.640
I believe so.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.760
Yes, thank you.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.920
Two scoops of that over at table Justin.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.600
Oh, my regards to the chef.

30:56.640 --> 30:59.440
My compliments to him on this perfection

30:59.440 --> 31:00.880
served on a platter.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.240
Who's the chef for this one?

31:02.240 --> 31:05.520
Well, consider me abashed

31:05.520 --> 31:08.880
because it is I, Justin, or Chef Justin

31:08.880 --> 31:10.160
as I prefer to be called

31:10.160 --> 31:10.720
when I'm wearing my hat and says that.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.160
Are you in a fugue state?

31:12.160 --> 31:12.800
What are you doing?

31:12.800 --> 31:14.880
You made dinner but you don't remember it?

31:16.080 --> 31:17.840
Yeah, that's how good it was

31:17.840 --> 31:20.960
because I convinced myself that no one could have made,

31:20.960 --> 31:24.160
no person that was me could have made this Blue Apron meal.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.440
That's right, it's Blue Apron

31:25.440 --> 31:27.360
that turned me into a chef magically,

31:27.360 --> 31:29.440
so magical I don't remember the details.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.000
You sound like a drunk chopped contestant.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.480
Like it's noodles with flavor.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.440
So Blue Apron is a service that will,

31:39.440 --> 31:42.320
you sign up for it and they send you boxes

31:42.320 --> 31:45.040
with meals in it that you get to make yourself

31:45.040 --> 31:46.560
and they're really like good meals.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.480
Like I just described one

31:48.480 --> 31:50.880
and then there's Thai green curry chicken

31:50.880 --> 31:52.640
and squash with the yu choy.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.680
That was in September.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.440
Roasted pork steam buns.

31:55.440 --> 31:56.960
I love the steam buns, man.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.160
You can't get those around here.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.040
So it's really nice.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.480
Like there's a lot of stuff.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.280
I live in West Virginia.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.840
There's a lot of stuff like I literally don't have access to

32:03.840 --> 32:05.760
like produce that I don't have access to

32:05.760 --> 32:06.880
and that kind of thing.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.800
So it's really cool to be able

32:08.800 --> 32:10.560
to get the experience of making those.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.480
You can check out this week's menu

33:22.080 --> 33:23.360
but build it beautiful.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.840
Maybe they're moving away.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.040
They're rebranding.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.000
They can't.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.280
You can't take that from me.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.280
Do you remember when Pepsi used to be Pepsi?

33:33.280 --> 33:34.400
America's Pepsi.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.320
And that was their tagline?

33:36.960 --> 33:38.400
And now every time I think of Pepsi

33:38.400 --> 33:40.320
it's like Pepsi America's Pepsi.

33:40.320 --> 33:45.920
I think the tagline was I think the tagline was Pepsi.

33:45.920 --> 33:46.880
It's better Coke.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.920
Do you remember when Dr. Bell.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.040
Oh sorry go ahead.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.280
Dr. Pepper had one and it was like Dr. Pepper

33:53.280 --> 33:54.400
the other brown stuff.

33:55.040 --> 33:55.920
And they said that.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.440
And now like every time I drink a Dr. Pepper

33:57.440 --> 33:59.120
I'm like that is the other brown stuff.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.400
Do you remember when Taco Bell invented tacos

34:02.400 --> 34:05.040
and had to sell them to a hungry nation in the 60s?

34:05.040 --> 34:06.720
And the tagline was Taco Bell.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.400
It's like a hamburger flipped in half.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.320
There's no one that ever had them.

34:11.680 --> 34:12.880
Yeah that was crazy.

34:12.880 --> 34:13.840
I'm so glad they invented it.

34:13.840 --> 34:18.320
We have a message for John from Kitty and Ten.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.960
Congratulations to the okayest dungeon master ever

34:22.960 --> 34:25.120
for acquiring your first home.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.520
That's all we have to say but the more I type

34:27.520 --> 34:29.600
the less each word costs.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.800
I've got it down to two dollars and eight cents.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.320
All the best Kitty Purry and Den Visa.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.880
Oh god when you break down the math like that

34:39.520 --> 34:41.280
it really makes me question the sort of

34:43.040 --> 34:44.640
efficiency of some of it.

34:44.640 --> 34:47.600
Well that and also like you just I would

34:47.600 --> 34:50.160
if the next Jumbotron I just want it to be like

34:50.160 --> 34:51.760
no articles.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.520
No just like conjunctions in every single word

34:55.520 --> 34:56.480
to just like squeeze.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.760
It reminds me of that that 1-800 collect commercial

35:01.760 --> 35:03.600
it's like we oughta baby eat Subway.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.320
You remember that?

35:04.320 --> 35:05.840
Oh it was a good commercial.

35:05.840 --> 35:06.400
That was good.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.560
I don't think we had a baby.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.920
It's a boy was the tagline.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.280
Rolling that commercial because it's like

35:15.280 --> 35:17.920
what a cheap man to spin the quarter.

35:17.920 --> 35:18.880
You just had a baby.

35:18.880 --> 35:19.920
It's a boy.

35:19.920 --> 35:20.640
Spin the quarter.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.600
Call your folks.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.440
Oh my god.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.400
I haven't thought about that fucking commercial yet.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.440
I haven't thought about the idea of collect calls

35:29.440 --> 35:30.800
in probably a decade.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.800
Wow times huh.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.440
The time as they are changing.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.720
This message is for Sarah and it's from Team Chicago

35:40.720 --> 35:44.240
which is apparently made up of Lauren Shell and Jess.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.880
The 2016 Chicago Bulls.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.280
Lauren Shell and Jess.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.200
That's right they're going with a three person

35:51.200 --> 35:53.520
basketball team which is unconventional.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.200
Sarah without you our nails would be ragged.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.280
Our skeeball teams would be sadder.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.600
And our party drinks would be flatter.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.720
Happy belated birthday to our favorite mixologist

36:06.720 --> 36:08.320
and Swasomest friend.

36:08.960 --> 36:09.680
We love you.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.040
To be fair they just said Swasom friend

36:13.040 --> 36:15.200
so she might not be there Swasomest.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.120
Yeah sure.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.520
I don't want to put words in Team Chicago's mouth.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.960
Sarah it sounds like provides

36:23.840 --> 36:26.560
and I try not to look at human beings this pragmatically

36:26.560 --> 36:29.360
but just like a lot of functionality.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.160
Oh yeah.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.840
Like my nails are looking good.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.520
My drink is very much on point.

36:33.520 --> 36:36.720
And what's that in the skeeball hole the 100.1?

36:36.720 --> 36:37.760
It's a ball.

36:37.760 --> 36:38.720
Sarah put it there.

36:38.720 --> 36:39.040
Damn.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.880
Damn Sarah.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.520
Now just to be fair Griffin it doesn't say that she

36:43.520 --> 36:45.920
brings any kind of skill to the skeeball

36:45.920 --> 36:47.840
but rather just makes them happy.

36:47.840 --> 36:50.880
So she might be like kind of you know like a mascot.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.040
Maybe she's not good at skeeball at all

36:53.040 --> 36:55.840
but rather she's got a lot of skeeball puns

36:55.840 --> 36:57.200
that every time she breaks them out

36:57.200 --> 36:59.920
everyone groans a little bit but they also smile and laugh too.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.080
Like they get it.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.720
Tai is a pedantic person.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.800
I think when he pronounces these words

37:08.800 --> 37:11.040
it's in a very show-offy way.

37:11.680 --> 37:12.480
Jairo.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.360
Yiro.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.400
Sacrebleu.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.360
Sacrebleu.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.400
Ayers Rock.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.040
Uluru.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.400
What you are witnessing is real.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.640
The participants are not actors.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.120
They are actual litigants with real cases.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.960
They call in via Skype to Judge John Hodgman's court.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.960
The real people's court.

37:32.960 --> 37:36.560
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

37:36.560 --> 37:40.880
Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.680
Hey I've got a Yahoo here.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.520
Oh I've been hoping you would say that.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.120
It's someone sent in by Sarah Urias.

37:49.120 --> 37:49.600
Thank you Sarah.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.680
They're anonymous.

37:51.680 --> 37:56.400
This platform is just quicksand.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.880
It's just sucking down.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.000
It's just disappearing.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.880
This anonymous user asks,

38:03.680 --> 38:04.960
did cavemen cry?

38:05.920 --> 38:07.040
Did cavemen cry?

38:08.320 --> 38:09.120
Wow.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.240
Did cavemen cry?

38:11.040 --> 38:12.880
Yeah but did cavemen cry?

38:13.920 --> 38:16.000
Here's cavemen.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.440
Uh huh.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.720
Things they had to worry about.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.240
One, fighting dinosaurs.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.760
Defo.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.760
Nonstop.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.760
Left and right.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.960
Left and right.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.800
Dinos, dinos, dinos, dinos, dinos.

38:28.800 --> 38:32.800
It was like Jurassic World up in there but for real this time.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.000
Fighting dinos just to survive.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.600
And I think when that's happening.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.600
Oh also other things they were worried about.

38:40.240 --> 38:43.760
Playing funny ribcage xylophones.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.200
Grunting at each other and trying to make sense of what

38:49.200 --> 38:51.840
augment in different contexts.

38:51.840 --> 38:56.800
Making just really shitty art on cave walls.

38:56.800 --> 38:57.840
Yeah good work guys.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.520
Yeah put it, where should we put my art?

38:59.520 --> 39:00.640
I'm gonna work really hard on it.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.320
It's the first art anyone's ever done.

39:02.320 --> 39:05.600
How about inside of this cave where nobody will ever come?

39:06.240 --> 39:07.760
Yeah that sounds, it seems good to me.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.640
What they don't tell you about cave art is that

39:11.280 --> 39:15.040
cavemen would only do it at their friends houses as a prank.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.320
Like you would come home and be like,

39:16.320 --> 39:20.720
uh god damn it Augg what is this?

39:20.720 --> 39:26.480
God damn it Jamie Kennedy senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.840
Come clean this up.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.440
This is uh this is terrible.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.520
This doesn't look like anything.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.440
What if cavemen just cried like at the drop of a hat?

39:35.440 --> 39:36.400
A lot yeah.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.600
All the fucking time.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.760
I got you this uh new bone.

39:39.760 --> 39:46.800
I saw it was crazy I saw a fucking huge dinosaur today.

39:46.800 --> 39:51.680
Did you check out that mastodon over there?

39:53.440 --> 39:54.480
Beautiful masto.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.120
Do you think they're like,

39:57.120 --> 40:00.880
I bet that there was probably a situation where they got to become like really good

40:00.880 --> 40:05.040
friends with the dinosaur uh and like they would pet them all the time but then their

40:05.040 --> 40:08.160
family would be like very hungry and they would have to like,

40:08.160 --> 40:12.480
and the dinosaur is very hungry too and they had to make that decision like do I feed my

40:12.480 --> 40:17.920
family to the dinosaur or vice versa and also it's the last dinosaur.

40:17.920 --> 40:23.040
Oh cool yeah and he's like as he's clubbing and he's like I'm sorry Grog sorry.

40:23.040 --> 40:32.400
Can you imagine how fucking annoying sidebar can you imagine how fucking annoying the meetings

40:32.400 --> 40:39.120
the meetings would have been when a bunch of cavemen decided to create language like

40:39.120 --> 40:46.880
let's call this one an apple like like no that's a terrible name for it it's a it has wings and it

40:46.880 --> 40:50.880
looks like a mouse with wings they can't call it an apple let's call it something else let's call

40:50.880 --> 40:54.640
it a bat they were just picking that shit from whole cloth yeah like that that must have been

40:54.640 --> 40:55.440
infuriating.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.520
Can we just call it all rocks?

40:57.520 --> 41:00.720
No we can't just call everything rocks Doug.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.560
Well everything is made out of rocks pretty much right like everything is just different

41:04.560 --> 41:08.160
size and shaped rocks you got to think long term Doug.

41:09.520 --> 41:14.640
Can you imagine being the first caveman to cry like maybe something like fall and just

41:14.640 --> 41:16.960
like water starts streaming from your eyeballs?

41:16.960 --> 41:23.600
Yeah what the fuck is Jerry even doing right now I don't know I got so bummed that I just

41:23.600 --> 41:24.560
started gushing.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.880
From these orbs in my face.

41:28.880 --> 41:29.840
Please.

41:29.840 --> 41:33.040
Yeah from these things that I don't know what they do when I poke them it hurts I don't

41:33.040 --> 41:37.200
know I don't know I'm stupid as hell when I go like this I can't see the dinosaurs anymore

41:37.200 --> 41:43.120
so I guess they're eyes anyway when I cry it's weird feels good as fuck to like really

41:43.120 --> 41:48.640
get it out there because we're all under a lot of duress and it we live to be 11 years

41:48.640 --> 41:52.960
old and so like there's kind of a lot going on right now and when I do this and I gush

41:54.000 --> 41:57.280
from my eyes I guess it feels good as fuck.

41:57.280 --> 42:03.360
Feels really good I just kind of sit down and take like one second off of like hunting

42:03.360 --> 42:09.200
and killing things and I just have like a moment for me where like I gush from these

42:09.200 --> 42:14.560
eye things and suddenly it's like oh yeah that was I don't know what's the word cathartic

42:14.560 --> 42:15.920
I just made that up.

42:15.920 --> 42:18.560
I just made that one up that's a crazy word I made up.

42:18.560 --> 42:22.960
Excuse me Philip I hate to interrupt I've been trying to do it I've been thinking like

42:22.960 --> 42:28.400
just like squeezing them and poking them and but I can't I'm not gushing like what's

42:28.400 --> 42:31.200
well maybe it's because you're a failure and you're bad at it.

42:31.840 --> 42:35.920
Wait hold on let me try let me try something and then he lets a velociraptor into eat

42:35.920 --> 42:40.720
your dad and it's like how about now yeah I'm gushing this is crazy it feels so good.

42:42.800 --> 42:47.440
Does the velociraptor get away with it or well no he goes to prison.

42:47.440 --> 43:03.200
Yeah cavemen cavemen cried if dogs cry right dogs cry sometimes I think cavemen probably

43:03.200 --> 43:03.920
did it.

43:03.920 --> 43:10.960
Cavemen didn't cry because cavemen were the luckiest phase of humanity ever because

43:10.960 --> 43:18.000
cavemen were the only listen I can prove this scientifically cavemen were the only

43:18.000 --> 43:26.240
time of any of our species history one of the very much only times when they didn't

43:26.240 --> 43:32.960
live among dinosaurs but were too stupid to realize that they could have with the things

43:32.960 --> 43:37.520
that shook them out just a bit differently like they missed the dinosaurs too like I

43:37.520 --> 43:42.000
miss them as well but I have to look at like their bones and realize like fuck I could

43:42.000 --> 43:46.560
have got a huge saddle and just like killed it out there they had no idea that they had

43:46.560 --> 43:53.200
missed out that was the last truly happy generation of humans like as soon as our like great awakening

43:53.200 --> 43:58.800
as a people was the first time somebody found like a giant tibia and was like oh fuck we

43:58.800 --> 44:05.840
fucked up we did it so bad just uh counterpoint they were also a generation where the leading

44:05.840 --> 44:12.160
cause of death was being devoured by a big and terrible dog and so I would argue that

44:12.160 --> 44:19.680
that wasn't so great and now we're worried about like not having internet and mean tweets

44:19.680 --> 44:25.840
and our millennials right huh the guy is so much better than cavemen and they don't even

44:25.840 --> 44:34.000
realize it I mean if I had to decide between people with anime avatars saying horrible

44:34.000 --> 44:41.600
things to me on twitter or being devoured by a big and horrible dog I think I'd actually

44:41.600 --> 44:45.040
go with the dog thing because at least then it's over with and now I have to live with

44:45.040 --> 44:51.840
the weight of these anime avatars my girlfriend and I live in a basement apartment and our

44:51.840 --> 44:56.560
landlord lives upstairs we have a door in the backyard that goes to our carport and

44:56.560 --> 45:01.680
we drive frequently our landlord has two small dogs that poop in the backyard so whenever we

45:01.680 --> 45:06.720
come home from work late at night we can't see well enough and sometimes step in dog poop it's

45:06.720 --> 45:11.440
her private backyard so she's probably never had to clean up after them should we ask that she

45:11.440 --> 45:15.360
clean up her dog's poop or just walk around the house and coming through the front door

45:15.920 --> 45:21.040
that's from doo doo dilemma in dc there's just the point in here it's her private backyard so

45:21.040 --> 45:27.520
she's probably never had to clean up after them oh okay so another caveman question then cool two

45:27.520 --> 45:33.440
in a row what is that yard just belongs to the dogs no one else gets back there so i just let

45:33.440 --> 45:42.720
the dookie pile up i'm turning into a real junk pit what are you saying i just leave the dookie

45:42.720 --> 45:50.560
there forever yeah you do have to like even if you own the dogs you do accept that like

45:51.520 --> 45:57.280
this is diminishing the value of this as a yard whenever you leave the dookie out there

45:57.280 --> 46:03.680
let me take you on a tour or march on your calendar is one worst day ever of your life

46:03.680 --> 46:07.200
this is my this is my house is the new bathroom we just got it remodeled and really happy with

46:07.200 --> 46:11.440
that i got yeah porcelain features and then oh you're gonna love the backsplash in the kitchen

46:11.440 --> 46:19.040
and anyway um this is the shit field don't go into the shit field you just have a like a big

46:19.040 --> 46:28.240
part of your yeah it's about 1500 square feet and it's just an ocean of dookie that one cleanup

46:28.240 --> 46:35.520
once a year though that's rough yeah the reaping i can't come with you guys this week the dark

46:35.520 --> 46:41.200
harvest begins on friday and then i'll have to take a day off uh maybe a week off just to like

46:41.200 --> 46:46.720
throw up yeah i think you just i think you just chuck a molotov cocktail back there and see what

46:46.720 --> 46:54.320
happened pave it pave it pave it more dirt over it and then more grass and then you just keep

46:54.320 --> 46:59.280
building it up so eventually you just have like a mountain of shit in your back i think that's how

47:00.080 --> 47:06.960
like uh uh like those landfills work yeah i think that's how uh the plot of the movie poltergeist

47:06.960 --> 47:12.000
we're agree though that they cannot speak to their landlord about this right like there is

47:12.000 --> 47:19.520
nothing that would upset me like if okay if my dog is pooping in the backyard and i'm just like

47:19.520 --> 47:24.320
living with that situation i have certainly done some soul searching prior to this about

47:25.200 --> 47:30.320
what sort of yard i want for myself what sort of yard i want to leave for my children and my

47:30.320 --> 47:35.680
children's children like i i think i've probably already made this life choice i don't need these

47:35.680 --> 47:39.760
young upstarts telling me what i should and shouldn't be doing with my poopy yard

47:39.760 --> 47:46.080
um yeah and also it's that's just a crazy thing to ask somebody hi i don't know you but i live in

47:46.080 --> 47:53.280
your house anyway touch shit touch touch shit touch it touch that shit go out there and get

47:53.280 --> 48:01.360
your hands get your grubby hands all over it maybe some kind of sky bridge now we're talking

48:02.000 --> 48:07.840
you either need to touch shit or put in a state-of-the-art sky bridge i'm talking like

48:07.840 --> 48:13.840
high bridge maybe like a ski lift that just sort of lifts you over the dukey fields or like that

48:13.840 --> 48:18.000
thing that wayne zelinsky had in honey i shrunk the kid that like you just lay in and kind of

48:18.000 --> 48:22.880
like pulley yourself across the yard and then you get on and it also helps you look for your

48:22.880 --> 48:29.680
miniature kids you remember god what if the kids from the kid shrinking movies and we cannot go

48:29.680 --> 48:35.280
off on another kid shrinking movie tangent again but what if this is where they got lost no

48:35.280 --> 48:42.800
no where are the kids they're they are they've they're better off dead at this point they're

48:42.800 --> 48:54.560
in they're lost in the shit fields oh god hey uh uh i have a uh vape confirmation by the way

48:54.560 --> 49:00.240
oh okay i didn't know this was a thing that we do on the show well this is one that we had

49:00.240 --> 49:05.920
discussed previously okay that i just wanted to put a pin in it because i got a text from

49:05.920 --> 49:12.240
my dear friend dwight slappy last night and it read thusly fyi john q sac was just caught vaping

49:12.240 --> 49:18.720
at the cubs game so that one is in the books that's an official like that i think he should

49:18.720 --> 49:24.160
actually be removed from which one vapes because that's an official one yeah it's just cheating i

49:24.160 --> 49:32.160
do want to hit you his jersey needs to get raised up into the rafters of which one you guys have a

49:32.160 --> 49:36.720
quick quick one because i didn't wander over the website while i was thinking about this and i did

49:36.720 --> 49:42.720
just want to hit you with this one montel williams versus tim curry which one vapes oh that's good

49:44.320 --> 49:50.720
now which one vapes though on that one does vape um i think tim curry tried it once and he said no

49:50.720 --> 49:59.360
i find it displeasurable uh expected winner was montel williams i think that's right yeah i think

49:59.360 --> 50:07.280
that one is is legit um alan cumming or mr t which one fuck that's a really alan cumming

50:08.960 --> 50:15.760
alan oh man oh man that's tough alan cumming can probably do cool like alan cumming definitely

50:15.760 --> 50:25.360
smoked analog and when he did that he probably could do cool like french smoke blow techniques

50:25.360 --> 50:32.400
and so i think that translates over to a vapor environment really really easily so i think you're

50:32.400 --> 50:41.040
really good at it i think it's alan okay fair enough it's mr t uh that just according to the

50:41.040 --> 50:47.520
science of which one vapes uh is mr t the whole time uh can we take it to the leaderboards mo

50:47.520 --> 50:51.120
real quick because yeah let's check the leaderboards i don't think there's been a lot

50:51.120 --> 50:56.960
of action uh but i do just want to recap number six most likely to vape rob kardashian number five

50:56.960 --> 51:04.480
ashton kutcher number four shyla buff uh number three macklemore number two chris angel i'm pretty

51:04.480 --> 51:10.880
sure this number one is new coming in with a bullet number one and it's basically absolutely

51:10.880 --> 51:18.560
so on point is dane cook um on on the number one uh number one least likely to vape right now is

51:18.560 --> 51:25.120
lana turner i think a lot of people use a cheap get out of jail free card with those least likely

51:25.120 --> 51:31.200
to vapes when they're i don't think you can assume that vape technology was not available

51:31.200 --> 51:36.080
in lana turner's time and that should like give her an out i think you need to just make the

51:36.080 --> 51:44.160
assumption debbie reynolds would have pulled down the thickest luscious cotton um by the way most

51:44.160 --> 51:50.160
likely brother to vape right now is travis excellent congrats i just i just don't see that

51:50.160 --> 51:55.680
but that's fine okay um i would i'm more of a second most likely i think but you know what
