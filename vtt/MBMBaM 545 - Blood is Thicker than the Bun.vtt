00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
We're gonna give advice and do funny sticks.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Laughter, it is in store.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Come inside and see.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
It's time to start.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother and me?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
An advice show of the modern era.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Hello, my children.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
It is I, the ascended Travis McElroy.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
It's just the name, Griffin is here.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello, I'm so glad that you, my brothers, could meet with me here.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Where are we?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Oh shit.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
You're here with me in the ascended plane.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
It's the keto juice.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
I told you, once he gets on that keto, he's gonna be different.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I have eaten 21 days of salad in a row.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh wait, it really is dietary, but your ascension really is based in the number-

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yes, Griffin.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah, okay.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
You've had three weeks of salad straight, and it seems that that was all it took.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay, let me just crack into your blockchain real quick, hold on.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Okay, let me just look at the cookie points.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Oh my god!

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Yes, Griffin.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Are you kidding me?

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
I traded my cookie points in for one, a dune buggy, and two, the ability to communicate telepathically.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, so that's actually on here.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
There's a website where you trade them in.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
It's kind of like jump rope for heart, and you did enough cookie points.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I guess you got a dune buggy.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Damn, that's aspirational.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Nobody actually gets the dune buggy.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I'm right now, Griffin, coming to you.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm tooling around in the dunes.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
But I'm hearing your fucking mind, your brainwaves.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
That is correct.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
That's so sick, dude.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes, and I had enough left over to get this paddle ball.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Okay.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Hey, be straight with me now, though, psychic dune Travis.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
How yucky was it to eat all of those salads?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Here's the problem with salads.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Sometimes you get a leafy bite.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes, it's true.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
There's no wet, and there's no crumble, and there's no beef.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
And one of the three always has to be in there in order for me to have a good chewing experience.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Listen, yes, sometimes there was a leaf that snuck in betwixt my chompers.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Right.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
And then those go straight to my brain.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
The crumble bits and the beef bits and the wet bits, they go to Tummy Town.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And the green bits, well, they go up to Brainberg.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
And in Brainberg, they get turned into the ability to levitate objects.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh, you can do that, too?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yes, I can, Griffin.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Look down.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
You're not touching your chair anymore.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
No, you're right.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I've been floating.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I just didn't know that that was you.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm levitating your butt.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, no, it feels weird.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I can actually, you know what's weird?

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
You're levitating me, but I feel two big hands.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And Griffin, I want you to know that was optional.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
It didn't have to feel like two hands, but I made it that way.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Trav, I know how many salads you've started.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
How many have you finished?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I finished every one, Justin.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
That's never happened.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
No one's ever gotten a salad.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh, let me explain.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I didn't complete them.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I was finished.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, that's stupid.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Now you're getting into semantics.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm saying everybody's ever gotten a salad.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Justin, eating so many salads has given me the power of semantics.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
No, it hasn't.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Everybody gets to a point in any salad ever where they're like, I'm done.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
This is it.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm done.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I would like to play in your salad game too, please.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
You got it.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Please let me play with your salad game too.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Here's my trick, Justin, and I recommend this to everybody.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
And he just keeps going.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
God damn it, Travis.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
It's the power I have.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
It's the salad juice.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
He's in control.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
We need to just let him.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Oh, salad juice.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Croats everywhere.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
Justin, you must build your salad in a glass bowl so that when you finish, you can lift

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
it up, see through it, and say, I have the clarity of salad now.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
See, that was nothing.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yes, it was.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It was actually something on this plane.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
All right.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Oh my God.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
He's got me jealous.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm going to go open up my mini fridge I have in my office and eat the salad I've got here.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Wait a minute.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
It's gone.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
There's just a calling card here.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
That's right.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
It says, now it's mine, and it's from Professor Cabbage?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Is that what you call yourself now?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh, wait.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Hold on.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Professor Cabbage?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Griffin, you have to get out of the house right now.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Wait, you're not Professor Cabbage?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
You're not safe.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
No, Griffin.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
He is a salad eater slash serial killer.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Okay.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I'll get out of...

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh no!

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
My arch nemesis.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh, boy.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
I have thrown a bottle of bacon bits at your brother so hard that he died.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Luckily, so much salad has given me the ability to resurrect Griffin.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Oh, thanks, Travis.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
You really got...

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
You should have killed me first.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Okay.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Okay, I recognize my mistake now.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm going to try to kill you.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm going to kill you first, right?

05:36.000 --> 05:48.000
I want to change the name of MBMBAM here in 2021.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
The subtitle is no longer an advice show from the modern era.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Now it's MBMBAM characters welcome.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
This year, characters have been welcomed lovingly, and we're not a big character show.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
But we've been lovingly welcoming characters in, and boys, I'm wild about it.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm wild about it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
I love it.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Professor Cabbage has got legs.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
He does.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Rabbit legs.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
No, it's rabbit legs, actually.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
He's a huge rabbit.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
No, Travis.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
He's a man with two long, big, sexy legs.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, I'm thinking of a different Professor Cabbage.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Don't tell me what my fucking Professor Cabbage HC is.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
I can be whatever I want.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
He's an audio character.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
This is fair.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Glad for you, Trav.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Thank you.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Glad for your salads, bud.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Hey, listen, folks.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
This is still an advice show, and we are so happy to be here with-

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Is it?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
It is.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
It is.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
We're so happy to be here with you, and we're so grateful that you've welcomed us back into your incredible lives.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
We love you, and we're ready to help.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
We're here to help, and I think maybe with all the characters, we maybe lost sight of that a little bit, and I am so sorry about that.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
That's true.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
We should say at the top of the show, some exciting developments vis-a-vis the theme song is,

07:05.000 --> 07:14.000
We've Been Terribly Sued by Klaski Supo, and this is our final episode because they said that it's not funny anymore,

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
and that they worked very hard on the Rugrats song, and that I actually am now in jail,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
and I'll have to go there, and Klaski Supo is going to drive me there.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
People keep saying it's similar to Rugrats.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I don't hear it.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I don't hear it.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
If anything, it's Hey Arnold.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I was also going to say Hey Arnold.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Was that Hey Arnold?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I forget.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
But we are partnering.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Partnering makes it sound like we're doing any work at all.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
No, no, no.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
We are relying fully upon.

07:44.000 --> 07:53.000
We are relying fully on a very talented artist who is working on a song for us that is very good.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
We're very excited about it, and we'll have more news about that.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
She sent us a demo recently, and it's going to be very good.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It's going to blow your asses right off.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Well, now you're getting a little crazy, Travis.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Okay, it's going to put your asses back on.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
No, the asses will be intact.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Your ass won't move.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Music doesn't do anything to your butt.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Music doesn't do anything to your butt.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
It depends on how loud you play it.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Dang, isn't this true?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I just got an email today.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
I just got an email that today my work is having a virtual team building.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Oh, you got me.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Justin, you got me.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Finally, to boost morale while we're all working remote.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
The event is a virtual escape room over Zoom, not a video game.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
They are having us attempt a real escape room.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
The worst part is it will be done by shouting instructions at a stranger in California who has a phone strapped to his head.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Oh, boy.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
How do I get through this unbearably awkward meeting while still showing my manager I'm a team player?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
That's from Sequestered in Seattle.

08:51.000 --> 09:00.000
They legally can't make you go to an online meeting if you have diarrhea so bad you can't get off the toilet.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
And this may be one of those times where you just got to rip the rip cord off.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Are you sure, Griffin?

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Because I think it would be easier to go to an online meeting if you had diarrhea so bad you couldn't get off the toilet.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
It's not proper.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
It's not proper.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
It's improper.

09:16.000 --> 09:26.000
I hate to be that guy, but if you can get you some diarrhea, then they can't make you do it.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
And this is so bad.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Do you need real diarrhea there or you can't just say you have diarrhea?

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
For me, Trav, you know it's not an issue because I can more or less at will change my stuff in there.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
This sucks, dude.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Wow, that's rough.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Everybody in your meeting is going to be talking to a real person who's explaining.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
What?

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
You know, I once worked in haunted houses for very rich kids' birthday parties, amazingly.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Or Halloween parties in LA for one October.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
I remember when you accidentally murdered Jonathan Lipnicki.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Do you remember that?

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
And then you had to find a kid who looked like him to go out and play him and you swore you'd never tell?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Of course I remember that, Griffin.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
I did one time scare Jonah Hill very, very solidly scared Jonah Hill.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Oh, that's nice.

10:25.000 --> 10:38.000
But I thought that that was maybe the most demeaning job that perhaps an adult person could do for a short period of time for like a very specialized like, I don't think this is a job, but I'll do it.

10:38.000 --> 10:48.000
I think having a phone strapped to your head while you are the homunculus for a bunch of people trying to do an escape.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
You're one person alone in an escape room while a legion of voices yell at you could break a human being in 15 minutes.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
We love an escape room, Jesus.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
We're all about that life.

11:02.000 --> 11:16.000
It's just the idea of your workplace being the, this person being the conduit for all the sort of disparate voices in your workplace scenario.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
It doesn't sound great.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
So how do you get through it, I guess?

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, I guess maybe like most being the most supportive.

11:26.000 --> 11:34.000
That's something that every puzzle room needs, but it's rarely done like just sort of like a hype like, you've got this or like, good one.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
If you bleep, maybe it's magnets.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
If you say maybe it's magnets every few minutes, you're eventually going to hit on something.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Oh yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Just say, I bet that does something.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Anytime anybody like if they picks up, oh, I bet that does something.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
That looks like a pattern to me.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
And if anybody says that looks like a pattern to me, or I bet that does something, or I bet it's magnets, you just go, yeah, no, that's what I was going to say.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Maybe you're this person who's like roping people back in.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Like people who've like kind of checked out.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
You're the one who's like every few minutes, you're like, what do you think, Carol?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Hey, Dougie, where are you at on this right now?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Where are you at on this?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Get aggressive.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Garrett hasn't said anything in a while, huh?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Garrett's being suspiciously quiet.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Are you part of the escape room, Derek?

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
I know you've worked with the company for seven years, but have you been a plant this whole time?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
You moonlighting, Derek?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Huh?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
You thief.

12:30.000 --> 12:47.000
God, I feel like there's the inverse solution to this, which may be better, which is that you get fucking down and dirty, hog wild as hard as you can solving this fucking puzzle room with the hopes that you can just get through it the fastest.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Yeah, and if anybody else is like, I don't know, we can check the tree.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
We're not checking the tree, all right?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
The tree had nothing in it.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
You're done.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Mute yourself.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
I once did an escape room with our then one-year-old in the room with us.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
You want to talk about a fucking real-life escape room.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Bring some pulse-pounding thrills.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Do it like that, a little time bomb in there.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Diaper time bomb.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
There's no changing tables in fucking Sherlock Holmes' office.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
People rip him down, and they'd be like, Sherlock Holmes didn't have a baby.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
This is a clue.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
And I just want to say, nobody actually knows that for sure.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Sherlock Holmes might have had a baby.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Oh.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah, I've been writing-

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
And his name was Travis Patrick McElroy.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Thank you very much.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Son of Sherlock Holmes.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Son of Sherlock Holmes.

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
Well, see, I froze Sherlock Holmes in a cryogenic chamber, and then he woke up in 1990s San Francisco to solve crimes, and he's my dad.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah, and you had to teach him a lot about how-

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I did. He didn't know about how phones work.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
What an idiot.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
The first time this dude had a Slurpee.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Blew his mind.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Blew his fucking cord.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
So I was thinking the other day, guys.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I was thinking about Under the Table and Fishing.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Oh my god.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
And can we talk about the biggest problem with Under the Table and Fishing?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
It goes too long.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
I'm glad we're doing these sort of-

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Postmortems.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Well, production, really.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
We're talking production conversations on the dime of the listener.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Well, here's the problem.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Here's the problem with Under the Table and Fishing.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
There's a problem with it?

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah, it's often so obvious which one's Dave Matthews because it's so fucking horny.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Right.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
And then it hit me.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And now allow me to present to you.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Under the Table and Fishing presents Your Body is a Satellite.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Is it Dave Matthews or John Mayer?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Fuck!

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Ooh, that's something, huh?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
That's something.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
That's something.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Here's the thing.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
I know four of his songs.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
So-

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
It's me, Dave Matthews.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
No, do John Mayer.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah, be John Mayer.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Your Body is a Satellite.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
No, that's not what he-

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
That's just singing.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
He doesn't just walk around singing these fucking songs.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
It's me.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
You may as well be.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It's me, John Mayer.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
There he is.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
He's kind of pretty.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Thank you for playing the game with me and my friend, Dave Matthews Man.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Dave Matthews.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm the Dave Matthews Man from the Dave Matthews Band doing my court-appointed community service.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Kind of turning to Tim Curry there.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
There's a lot of people in the studio and we only brought so many chips.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Okay.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Now-

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm here too.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
It's me, James Blunt.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
You're beautiful.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Get out of here, James Blunt.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
There's not room.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
You'll never guess which song is mine.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I'll start.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
You're beautiful.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
All right, James.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
James, you didn't make the cut.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
We talked about this.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
My life is brilliant.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
No, hey, you can grab something off of the table to eat and we have some t-shirts on

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
your way out if you want one of those.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Hello, hello, hello.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
It's me, Ed Sheeran.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Oh, boy.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Hello, hello.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Hello.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, look at me.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Look at me ketchup.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Oh, man.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Ed Sheeran and James Blunt are making out.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Hello, hello.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I love to kiss him.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
You're beautiful, Ed Sheeran.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I love to fill my mouth with ketchup and do a kiss.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Oh, man.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
It's really romantic, actually.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
A lot of fucking characters, though.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Let's do this game.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Okay.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Round one.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Now, here's what I'm going to do.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I'm going to give you one set of lyrics from both and I want you guys to tell me which

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
one's which.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
All right?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
This is going to be confusing.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
So it's like head to head.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
You ready?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.700
I'm going to give you four of your kiss, your words, your lips, your flesh, your bones.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.500
Exactly what you need.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.500
Option two.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.980
Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?

16:16.980 --> 16:19.460
Is he the one who turns the ladies on?

16:19.460 --> 16:21.760
Will I keep shining till my light is gone?

16:21.760 --> 16:23.000
Who did you think I was?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.360
Oh, so you're complicating things even more.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.620
We have to pair them.

16:26.620 --> 16:27.620
One is Dave.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.620
One is Mayor.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.620
Correct.

16:29.620 --> 16:30.620
Number one is Dave.

16:30.620 --> 16:31.620
Number two is Mayor.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.620
Two is Mayor.

16:32.620 --> 16:33.620
Yes.

16:33.620 --> 16:34.620
Correct.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.620
Yes.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.620
Round two.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.620
I will beg my way into your garden.

16:37.620 --> 16:41.560
I like that we don't pause to make any jokes or observations about the quiz show.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.600
This is a straight up and down real test.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.800
Okay.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.840
I will beg my way into your garden.

16:47.840 --> 16:52.280
I will break my way out when it rains just to get back to the place where I started.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.280
That's John Mayer.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.220
So I can want you back all over again.

16:57.220 --> 17:00.480
This one's John Mayer because I've heard this song before and the other one is Dave Matthews,

17:00.480 --> 17:01.480
man.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.480
Damn it.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.480
Let me drink you please.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.480
I won't spill a drop.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.480
I promise you.

17:05.480 --> 17:10.320
Lying under this spell you cast on me each moment the more I love you.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.920
Now this one is where it's going to get tough.

17:11.920 --> 17:12.920
Well that was Dave.

17:12.920 --> 17:13.920
You were right.

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
Yeah.

17:14.920 --> 17:15.920
This one's where it's going to get tough.

17:15.920 --> 17:16.920
Okay.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.460
Don't hold your love over my head.

17:19.460 --> 17:21.960
Don't hold your love over my head, yeah.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.240
Don't hold your love over my head.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.200
Don't hold your love over my head.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.200
Come on.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.500
Come back to bed.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.500
And then-

17:29.500 --> 17:31.360
That's John Mayer's come back to bed.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.840
This isn't that hard actually.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.560
John Mayer's always in bed and he just wants you to come back to bed.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.200
How do you know so many fucking John Mayer songs, Griffin?

17:38.200 --> 17:39.200
It's a five, isn't it?

17:39.200 --> 17:46.000
He's a major fucking recording artist and I liked to make out in the early aughts.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.820
I was feeling- Okay, just listen to this actual factual Dave Matthews lyric that Dave Matthews

17:51.820 --> 17:57.880
man wrote and said, this is a fine thing to project out into the world that I Dave Matthews

17:57.880 --> 17:59.760
thought of with my brain.

17:59.760 --> 18:05.180
I was feeling like a creep as I watched you asleep, face down in the grass, in the park,

18:05.180 --> 18:07.120
in the middle of hot afternoon.

18:07.120 --> 18:14.400
Your top was untied and I thought how nice it'd be to follow the sweat down your spine.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.560
And then I killed you.

18:16.560 --> 18:20.520
And then I killed- The reason you were face down is I'd stabbed you 10 minutes prior.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.640
It's because I'm the Zodiac killer Dave Matthews man.

18:24.640 --> 18:28.120
Me and old Ted Cruz did a two-hander on Zodiac.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.120
That was us.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.120
Okay.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.120
Final round.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.120
All right.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.120
All right.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.020
Option one, you can't get too much love.

18:36.020 --> 18:37.360
Don't you feel it in your belly?

18:37.360 --> 18:38.360
Go get some.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.260
Go get you some, excuse me.

18:40.260 --> 18:42.000
You can't get too much love.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.640
The time is right for loving.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.680
So come on, come on.

18:46.680 --> 18:53.320
Option two, had a little love, but I spread it thin, falling in her arms and out again,

18:53.320 --> 18:58.320
made a bad name for my game around town, tore up my heart and shut it down.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.320
Dave and Mayor.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.320
Dave first, Mayor second.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.320
Same.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.320
Correct.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.320
Damn.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.320
Okay.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.320
I thought that'd be harder, Griffin.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.320
I didn't expect you to be such a Mayo.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.320
Yeah.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.320
I mean, I don't really know his new shit.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.320
I used to be so tender.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.320
Griffin, what happened?

19:17.320 --> 19:20.320
Yeah, where'd it go wrong?

19:20.320 --> 19:21.320
9-11.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.320
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

19:22.320 --> 19:25.320
A lot of people sent this one in.

19:25.320 --> 19:31.400
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Amelia, who asks, can you live in a restaurant, but not

19:31.400 --> 19:33.080
sell food?

19:33.080 --> 19:36.680
I was wondering if you can buy a restaurant, for example, a Taco Bell.

19:36.680 --> 19:40.160
If the Taco Bell shut down for any reason, could I buy the property and turn it into

19:40.160 --> 19:44.640
a house, just like your average living space, keep the logos and signs up that advertise

19:44.640 --> 19:48.840
it as a Taco Bell, but it won't actually sell food, and I technically won't be a Taco

19:48.840 --> 19:49.840
Bell anymore.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.320
Why would you do that, though?

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
Funny.

19:54.320 --> 20:00.400
I think that they wouldn't want you to keep up the logos and signs.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.040
You might be able to get away with it for a while.

20:02.040 --> 20:07.800
I don't think they're going to send Papa King to your house, and by your house, I mean

20:07.800 --> 20:09.080
the former Taco Bell building.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.680
They're not going to send him in to tear your shit down or anything, but they aren't going

20:12.680 --> 20:13.680
to like it.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.680
They aren't going to like that.

20:14.680 --> 20:20.480
Yeah, but you're just opening yourself up to people coming in your house unbidden and

20:20.480 --> 20:25.160
being like, hey, can I get, and you're like, oh, it's not actually, I don't serve food,

20:25.160 --> 20:29.960
and they're like, then why do you have all the signage and everything you left the light

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
on for me?

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
Why wouldn't I?

20:31.960 --> 20:34.320
Now, here's what's a way more interesting thing.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.320
Yeah.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.040
There are some McDonald's that are open 24-7.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.320
Could I live in that McDonald's?

20:41.320 --> 20:42.320
What do you-

20:42.320 --> 20:46.920
You know, like in the movie Terminal, where he just lives in the terminal?

20:46.920 --> 20:47.920
Correct.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.640
Yeah, I'm just like, living in McDonald's.

20:50.640 --> 20:56.600
So you're saying because it's open 24-7, then you could live in it?

20:56.600 --> 21:01.440
As opposed to a normal, like a regular business hours McDonald's?

21:01.440 --> 21:03.320
This point doesn't make much sense, Trav.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.320
That's fair.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.320
But could you buy that McDonald's after it goes under and live in McDonald's?

21:06.320 --> 21:08.560
Hell, this is my house, McDonald's.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.600
I don't think I'd want to buffet.

21:09.600 --> 21:14.000
If I was going to do this, I'd want to get a restaurant that had a buffet in it.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Right?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Because that's just fun.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.120
But if you have friends over, it's already halfway done.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.120
True, yourself.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.120
But okay, wait, wait, wait.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.600
I need you to understand something.

21:22.600 --> 21:27.480
If a Taco Bell goes under and I move in, I buy the building and I move in, and I refuse

21:27.480 --> 21:35.240
to take down the Taco Bell signage, the beef that's in there is one day going to rot.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.040
You don't think they took the beef?

21:38.040 --> 21:43.360
Okay, but you suggesting, I want a buffet so when friends come over, we can have a buffet.

21:43.360 --> 21:44.360
You realize you're going to have to-

21:44.360 --> 21:45.360
No, I don't mean the food is there.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.240
I mean all the equipment, Griffin.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.280
So you just want to have fun with buffet equipment.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.160
I'm saying that the locations are there.

21:51.160 --> 21:58.920
I can make, you know, big things of say, spaghetti or salad or yogurt or whatever and just dump

21:58.920 --> 21:59.920
them in.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.920
It's already there.

22:00.920 --> 22:01.920
I could do that in my house.

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
I could do that in my house with big bowls.

22:02.920 --> 22:08.360
Yeah, but you have to put it on a table, Griffin.

22:08.360 --> 22:14.920
When you shop around for houses, do you look and pay attention to, well, here's a cold

22:14.920 --> 22:17.720
hole that I can put pudding in.

22:17.720 --> 22:21.120
This is why I'll buy this one.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.120
That doesn't mean-

22:22.120 --> 22:23.120
You don't see the pudding.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.720
You don't see the pudding hole at buffets much anymore.

22:25.720 --> 22:29.840
I don't think my kids have ever seen a pudding hole in a buffet.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.840
That's true.

22:30.840 --> 22:31.840
Especially not in the, oh, in the current days?

22:31.840 --> 22:32.840
Oh, God.

22:32.840 --> 22:33.840
That was-

22:33.840 --> 22:37.800
To close down our Golden Corral here in Huntington, guys, I don't know if you knew.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.720
If Golden Corral can't make it into Huntington, I don't know what to tell them, although

22:40.720 --> 22:48.200
I guess this unpleasant time, this challenging year, was rough on buffet restaurants, I think.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.200
Yeah, probably.

22:49.200 --> 22:54.220
You know, I think I would rather, and I know this wasn't the question, but that's never

22:54.220 --> 22:59.400
stopped me before, I think I'd rather live on a putt-putt course than I would-

22:59.400 --> 23:01.480
Wow, that really has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.640
No, I mean, just a restaurant feels so restrictive.

23:05.640 --> 23:10.420
I think with the putt-putt course, you can have, I live in the windmill, and this water

23:10.420 --> 23:11.420
trap is my pool.

23:11.420 --> 23:15.180
I just feel like it's more flexible as far as the things you could do with it, and more

23:15.180 --> 23:16.180
fun over time.

23:16.180 --> 23:21.160
Because after a while, I think living in a Taco Bell, it would wear off pretty quickly,

23:21.160 --> 23:25.360
where then you're just in a Taco Bell, and you're like, well, there's no rooms and no

23:25.360 --> 23:34.840
real place for a bed, whereas I think with a putt-putt course, there's a lot more options

23:34.840 --> 23:36.840
as far as designing it goes.

23:36.840 --> 23:41.280
There's a lot more options as far as dying of exposure, because it's an outdoor venue

23:41.280 --> 23:42.280
you chose.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.040
It's so, so insane what you just said, Travis.

23:44.040 --> 23:48.720
It's maybe the, can I say, you've got a checkered past, and I think we would all be lying to

23:48.720 --> 23:49.720
ourselves.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.760
It may be the dumbest thing you've ever said on the show.

23:51.760 --> 23:57.160
It's so wild to say, to go into a Taco Bell building and be like, no room for a bed in

23:57.160 --> 23:58.280
this one.

23:58.280 --> 24:03.760
It's got two bathrooms in it, the Taco Bell does already, and a break room, and a kitchen,

24:03.760 --> 24:04.760
and a living space.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.240
When was the last time you guys went putt-putting?

24:07.240 --> 24:09.760
There's almost always a cave you walk through or some shit.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.280
There's always at least one interior part of the putt-putt course.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.280
There's a little waterfall.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.280
That's cool.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.280
It's so exposed to the elements, you monster.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.280
It's so wild.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.280
Fuck, man.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.240
Ah, you guys are being so close-minded right now.

24:22.240 --> 24:27.760
You're telling me you would rather live in an old, stinky Taco Bell than in a fresh air.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.040
What you just said is fucking hateful, first of all.

24:30.040 --> 24:35.400
You don't think that the fucking smell of beef is so baked in.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.400
Pleasant and good?

24:36.400 --> 24:37.400
Yeah, no, for sure, dude.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.400
For sure, for sure.

24:38.400 --> 24:43.240
Maybe pleasant for like 10 minutes when you're in the Taco Bell, but if it was all the time,

24:43.240 --> 24:47.520
I'm telling you right now, hey, any Taco Bell employee listening to this, you tell us right

24:47.520 --> 24:48.520
now.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.560
You tweet at Griffin McElroy, at Justin McElroy.

24:50.560 --> 24:55.480
Tell them about how your clothes smell when you come home from Taco Bell, and I'm not

24:55.480 --> 24:56.900
even going to lead the witness.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.080
You just tell them how they smell.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.480
When the family comes up to you after you get home from a shift and gives you big hugs.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.680
You're chased by dogs down the street.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.600
Ooh, what is that spicy beef smell?

25:05.600 --> 25:09.560
All the neighborhood straight dogs are trying to kill you and eat your shirt.

25:09.560 --> 25:13.080
Everyone grab Dennis and huff him quick before the smoke, before the scent goes away.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.640
I don't need those tweets, by the way.

25:14.640 --> 25:19.320
I worked at Olive Garden where we always came home coated in something called OG water.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.320
Oh, yeah.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.320
We've talked about OG water, I believe.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.280
So, yeah, I don't need a lesson in that.

25:24.280 --> 25:28.320
My man, Tommy Redd, used to give me a ride to school every day, and he would have his

25:28.320 --> 25:30.360
Fizzoli's clothes in the back seat.

25:30.360 --> 25:37.560
And God, every time I got into his car, it was like an assassin was trying to suffocate

25:37.560 --> 25:38.560
me with garlic bread.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.560
It was the worst.

25:39.560 --> 25:47.180
I'm just saying, a Taco Bell establishment is one bed away from being a home.

25:47.180 --> 25:48.180
That's it.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.180
That's beautiful.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.700
You could actually cross stitch that into a sampler.

25:50.700 --> 25:54.260
Every Taco Bell staff is a family.

25:54.260 --> 25:57.160
That's what I've been trying to get you guys to realize.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.160
We're a family here.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.400
We look out for each other.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.360
Is that why you keep giving me those applications?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.040
I'm just saying it's a family, Travis.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.080
You could finally have a family of your own.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.080
Imagine it.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.920
Blood is thicker than the bun.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.320
That doesn't make sense.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.480
Think outside the blood.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.480
Inside the blood.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.560
I recently quit my job at a certain fast food place.

26:19.560 --> 26:20.560
Wow.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.160
We didn't part on the best terms.

26:22.160 --> 26:26.360
I told them I was quitting in the middle of a mandatory quarantine.

26:26.360 --> 26:31.160
While I'm happy to never make the food again, their salads were once a regular lunch for

26:31.160 --> 26:32.160
me.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.160
My question is this.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.880
Was the appropriate amount of time to wait before I can head back to the drive-thru window

26:35.880 --> 26:37.560
I used to clean?

26:37.560 --> 26:41.800
That's from Wendy's Widow in West Virginia.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
Right away.

26:42.800 --> 26:51.040
A weird conflux of talking points in this episode already here.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.040
You left the familia, and there's a price to pay with that, I feel like.

26:56.040 --> 26:59.120
I would say zero amount of time.

26:59.120 --> 27:04.480
I think the best thing you could do is walk out, get in your car, drive through the drive-thru,

27:04.480 --> 27:05.480
and get a salad.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.920
Yeah, I mean, I completely agree.

27:06.920 --> 27:11.760
I feel like you quit, you get in your car, you pull up to the window, one Southwest avocado

27:11.760 --> 27:15.260
chicken for me to go.

27:15.260 --> 27:19.640
Because the best part about that is possibly you do that before the other person realizes

27:19.640 --> 27:23.360
you don't get an employee discount anymore.

27:23.360 --> 27:28.080
If you time it right, it might be the only way to guarantee you've got the most sumptuous

27:28.080 --> 27:32.160
foods is if you prep the chicken and all the salad ingredients.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.160
Like, I quit.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.400
Hey, could you hand me that salad I just made?

27:35.400 --> 27:36.400
I already made it.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.040
I made it perfectly.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.520
Don't fucking touch it.

27:39.520 --> 27:45.800
I put the two giant ice cream scoops of guacamole on top, just like I like.

27:45.800 --> 27:46.800
Don't mess it up.

27:46.800 --> 27:58.840
The taco salad at Wendy's, if I may, the taco salad at Wendy's has chips and it's got chili,

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
right?

27:59.840 --> 28:01.480
Because it's a taco salad.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.640
There's two things I'd like to address here.

28:03.640 --> 28:09.960
One, the chili on top is the same chili that they serve if you buy chili.

28:09.960 --> 28:14.680
The chili at Wendy's is chock full of big chunks of ground beef that are just cut up

28:14.680 --> 28:16.280
hamburgers.

28:16.280 --> 28:22.360
So when you get a taco salad, you're eating twice repurposed beef, which I don't love.

28:22.360 --> 28:27.480
The thing I do love, though, is the bag of chips that Wendy's gives you says it's crunch

28:27.480 --> 28:28.480
time on it.

28:28.480 --> 28:34.980
And what I like about that is they're branding the chips that I have had no part.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.800
You cannot order these chips.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.760
You do not need to sell me on the chips.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.000
I'm going to enjoy.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.960
They might as well just say chips and crayon chips with a question mark.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.520
You're still going to fucking eat them.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.680
You're going to eat them because these are the chips.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.080
But no, it says it's crunch time.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.720
So you get even more excited.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.720
Oh, yeah.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.520
You could say fucking poison on them.

28:54.520 --> 28:57.360
And you would still open them and be like, oh, no, these are the chips that go with the

28:57.360 --> 28:59.260
salad that I put on there.

28:59.260 --> 29:01.560
I'm not examining the packaging.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.080
I'm not looking for a best consumed by date.

29:04.080 --> 29:08.320
You can't take that back to the register and be like, give me different chips.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.440
What a refund for these poison chips.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.440
No, sir.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.440
They're not poison.

29:13.440 --> 29:17.280
They're just to scare away the fair weather fans of our chips.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.720
These are for the real windows.

29:19.720 --> 29:24.960
We've I mean, we've had jobs in food service before.

29:24.960 --> 29:28.200
I think not counting the concession stand at the movie theater that I believe we all

29:28.200 --> 29:32.320
worked at or maybe just me and Travis, because I did definitely haunted that.

29:32.320 --> 29:36.240
I did haunt that particular theater after I quit there.

29:36.240 --> 29:41.480
But like the TCBY where I cut my teeth, I didn't fucking darken the doorstep of that

29:41.480 --> 29:43.120
particular that it does.

29:43.120 --> 29:48.000
We can talk a big game here, but it does feel, I don't know, wrong to me in a way.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.840
I never went back.

29:49.840 --> 29:50.840
Let me.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.400
Did you ever go back to the Justin, the Olive Garden?

29:53.400 --> 29:55.640
Did you ever return to it extracurricularly?

29:55.640 --> 29:56.640
Oh, constantly.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.640
Yeah.

29:57.640 --> 29:58.640
Okay.

29:58.640 --> 29:59.640
Of course.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.640
It is the only OG in town, Griffin.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.640
That's true.

30:01.640 --> 30:02.640
I guess so.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.640
I never went back.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.640
It's OG OG.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.840
I never went back to the Jimothy Johns that I worked out.

30:05.840 --> 30:06.840
Oh, right.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.560
I never went back to the hotel breakfast restaurant that I worked out.

30:09.560 --> 30:14.560
But I think aside from the Shakespeare Company, I have not returned to any job I have ever

30:14.560 --> 30:15.560
worked at.

30:15.560 --> 30:16.560
Yeah.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.900
I hardly ever leave them on what one might call a warm regards.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.560
I don't have, I mean, I don't have a lot of options here.

30:23.560 --> 30:27.000
So I kind of have to, I can't burn any bridges.

30:27.000 --> 30:35.760
Like if I burn a bridge with the Chipotle in town, I just don't ever get to eat Chipotle

30:35.760 --> 30:36.760
again.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.440
Yes, you no longer get burritos.

30:38.440 --> 30:39.440
I take that back.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.720
I did return to the Best Buy I had worked at after I quit.

30:42.720 --> 30:47.080
And even though it was six months later, many of the people I encountered were surprised

30:47.080 --> 30:49.440
to learn I didn't work there anymore.

30:49.440 --> 30:55.720
So like just maybe just take that in if you're worried about going back, chances are none

30:55.720 --> 30:57.180
of them care.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.500
So that's something.

30:59.500 --> 31:02.520
It's called Best Buy, not Best Friends.

31:02.520 --> 31:03.520
That's true, Griffin.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.480
But fucking I bled blue for that place.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.480
You know I did.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
Yeah.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.360
He was always like 573 on top.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.360
That's right.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.080
He was always like repping the store.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.840
This is a fun thing because Huntington's not that big of a place.

31:15.840 --> 31:20.320
There's an overlap of jobs Justin and Griffin and I have worked at different times.

31:20.320 --> 31:24.520
It's a fun Venn diagram that I think we have six degrees of separation connected every

31:24.520 --> 31:25.920
business in Huntington.

31:25.920 --> 31:32.200
I don't think we've had the same, except for Cowabunga, the WTCR mascot, a job we worked

31:32.200 --> 31:35.640
very illegally at very young ages.

31:35.640 --> 31:36.640
Indeed.

31:36.640 --> 31:40.520
In fairness, we weren't paid in money, but rather in company trades.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.960
Yes, we were paid in skrit.

31:42.960 --> 31:43.960
Yeah.

31:43.960 --> 31:44.960
Radio skrit.

31:44.960 --> 31:51.000
I traded it in on a freaking couch for my parents who gave me a hundred dollars.

31:51.000 --> 31:56.280
Hey, listen, this has been so fun and I'm loving it, but let's take a quick break and

31:56.280 --> 32:08.920
go to the Money Zone.

32:08.920 --> 32:18.920
What's wrong, Trav?

32:18.920 --> 32:19.920
What's wrong?

32:19.920 --> 32:21.440
It is I, Beep Blork.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.440
I'm not.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.440
Actually, I am so sick.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.440
You have to handle Beep Blork.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.440
I'm going to the bathroom.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.440
Okay, Griff.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.440
Love you, bud.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.440
But I don't want to have to do it.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.080
See, Griffin, this is what I'm talking about.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.280
I came to this planet to get what you humans call love.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.280
Yeah.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.200
Perhaps it is Beep Blork's bad breath.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.200
Let's start.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.200
Can we do something else?

32:41.200 --> 32:42.200
Hey, Griffin.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.200
Yeah.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.200
Gum.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.200
What is it?

32:45.200 --> 32:47.000
Nobody's really sure.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.560
Quip.

32:48.560 --> 32:49.960
It's the good habits company.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.240
You've heard us say that a thousand times.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.240
What does that mean?

32:53.240 --> 32:54.240
Flossing.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.240
Yes.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.480
What about the rest of the time, right?

32:57.480 --> 33:00.800
We all like to eat some candy, maybe even chew some gum.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.040
Are those good habits?

33:02.040 --> 33:07.240
Well, they can be now because gum from Quip, it's new.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.860
It's there, and it's good for your oral health.

33:09.860 --> 33:13.800
It comes in a really cool dispenser that'll make you look like some kind of, I would say,

33:13.800 --> 33:16.920
cool spy with a cool spy gadget.

33:16.920 --> 33:17.920
Do I hear it?

33:17.920 --> 33:18.920
Do I hear the dispenser?

33:18.920 --> 33:19.920
Yes, please.

33:19.920 --> 33:20.920
Yes.

33:20.920 --> 33:21.920
Isn't that cool?

33:21.920 --> 33:22.920
Yeah.

33:22.920 --> 33:23.920
That's pretty good.

33:23.920 --> 33:28.240
I would warn you on the directions to not do it into your mouth because the gum does

33:28.240 --> 33:34.680
come out with, I will say this, Quip, a not inconsiderable amount of velocity.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.320
More stink than you needed to put on there.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.320
Yeah.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.920
Just do that into your hand and then eat the gum.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.920
No.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.920
I think it's the exact right amount of stink.

33:41.920 --> 33:42.920
Okay.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.640
Quip gum can help prevent cavities and freshen breath when chewed for 20 minutes after eating.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.760
It's sugar-free and has tooth-friendly xylitol with zero calories.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.760
Now, let's be clear.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.560
It's not a substitute for brushing and flossing, but it is a great support for your oral health

33:54.560 --> 33:58.960
and you can go ahead and pair that with your Quip electric toothbrush and refillable floss.

33:58.960 --> 34:04.080
And if you go to getquip.com slash my brother right now, you can get a free plastic dispenser

34:04.080 --> 34:05.640
with any refill plan.

34:05.640 --> 34:12.240
That's a free dispenser at getquip.com slash my brother, spelled G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash

34:12.240 --> 34:13.240
my brother.

34:13.240 --> 34:16.640
Quip, the good habits company.

34:16.640 --> 34:21.000
It says in here, we have to say it's not a substitute for brushing and flossing.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.880
Folks, if somebody made a gum that was a substitute for brushing and flossing, I don't think they'd

34:25.880 --> 34:26.880
need to run ads.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.440
I think you'd probably hear about it, right?

34:28.440 --> 34:30.320
It'd be all over the place.

34:30.320 --> 34:35.200
You'd go to CVS and they'd be like, uh-oh, looks like you can only have COVID vaccine

34:35.200 --> 34:38.360
or toothbrush gum.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.360
You'd go with toothbrush gum.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.400
Now, listen, it still gets you nice and clean.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.020
I like to pop one in there after lunch.

34:44.020 --> 34:45.020
You know what I like to do?

34:45.020 --> 34:46.020
Brush my teeth.

34:46.020 --> 34:48.120
And then after I drink my coffee, chew some gum.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.120
Chew some gum.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.120
That's over, guys.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.120
You don't have to keep chilling gum.

34:52.120 --> 34:55.640
You know, the seasons are changing.

34:55.640 --> 34:56.640
Yes.

34:56.640 --> 34:57.640
Right.

34:57.640 --> 34:58.720
God, we're like right in the middle of it.

34:58.720 --> 35:02.600
It's the least applicable that could possibly be, but things are cold here.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.640
And I realized that I don't have a lot of cold weather clothes, right?

35:06.640 --> 35:08.920
But twist, I don't go outside.

35:08.920 --> 35:13.500
So I've got all of these cold weather clothes and they're all ill fitting and also like,

35:13.500 --> 35:15.400
I don't want to wear them.

35:15.400 --> 35:19.600
And so I need to stock up on all kinds of different looks and there's only one place

35:19.600 --> 35:21.400
I have returned to for that.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.640
And that is Stitch Fix.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.340
It's not like online shopping.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.400
That's such a stretch, man.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.120
You get the clothes, you don't know what size they're going to be.

35:29.120 --> 35:34.040
You don't know any of that, but Stitch Fix does all the hard work and just makes it fun.

35:34.040 --> 35:39.760
You talk to one of their stylists about your style, your budget, what the size of your

35:39.760 --> 35:44.200
different body segments are, and they're going to mail you some clothes to try on.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.760
You keep the stuff you like, you send back the rest.

35:46.760 --> 35:52.280
Stitch Fix has free shipping, easy returns to exchanges, and a prepaid envelope is included.

35:52.280 --> 35:56.040
And there's no subscription required.

35:56.040 --> 36:02.040
Half my clothes I own probably around that came from Stitch Fix and the other half are

36:02.040 --> 36:06.000
Jimmy Buffett t-shirts.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.240
We really believe in this company and we love the fashion that they're able to extend to

36:11.240 --> 36:15.040
us and anybody who's willing to join up.

36:15.040 --> 36:20.480
So you can get started today at stitchfix.com slash my brother, and you'll get 25% off when

36:20.480 --> 36:21.920

36:21.920 --> 36:26.280
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother for 25% off when you keep everything in your fix.

36:26.280 --> 36:30.320
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.320
I'm going first.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.320
It's me, Jackie Cashin.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
Man, she's always this bossy.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
I'm Lori Kilgarten.

36:34.320 --> 36:44.320
We're a bunch of stand-up comics and we've been doing comedy like 60 years total, both

36:44.320 --> 36:48.400
of us, but we look amazing.

36:48.400 --> 36:52.480
We drop every Monday on MaxFun and it's called The Jackie and Lori Show and you could listen

36:52.480 --> 36:57.280
to it and learn about comedy and learn about anchor management and all the things.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.880
And Jackie is married but childless and I'm unmarried but childful.

37:01.880 --> 37:07.120
So together we make One Complete Woman.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.960
Is that just what that one's going to end?

37:10.960 --> 37:15.080
And we try to make Kyle laugh just like that and say, oh my God, every episode.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.080
It's a good job.

37:16.080 --> 37:20.280
The Jackie and Lori Show, Mondays only on Maximum Fun.

37:20.280 --> 37:24.440
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.840
I'm not cutting anybody off today.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.840
I'm done with that.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

37:28.840 --> 37:38.000
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Here I am.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.240
Munch me like a squatter cane.

37:43.240 --> 37:49.440
Hello, welcome to Munch Squad, this podcast is a podcast focusing on the lazy and grace

37:49.440 --> 37:57.080
in brand eating and this is a subseries of this podcast called Letters from the Poultry

37:57.080 --> 37:58.080
Front.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.920
Can I give you a quick note?

37:59.920 --> 38:00.920
Yeah, please.

38:00.920 --> 38:04.520
Munch me is not something I ever want to hear you say again.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.520
It's too late.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.520
It's in your hippocampus.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.040
It's got to live there.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.680
Rent free is the TikTok kids say.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.840
Oh, damn it.

38:13.840 --> 38:18.360
Guys, this is intense out there and I don't know if you've seen some of the bodies lining

38:18.360 --> 38:25.740
the streets, but the war is bloodier and more brutal than ever and it is not showing any

38:25.740 --> 38:27.080
signs of slowing.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.960
Hey, what the fuck are you talking about?

38:28.960 --> 38:36.000
I am going to read today, not in their entirety, but I'm going to give you a sampling of five

38:36.000 --> 38:43.920
press releases, all released within a no bullshit two week window.

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
Understand?

38:44.920 --> 38:45.920
Yeah.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
Yeah.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
Okay.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.240
Let's check in on checkers and rallies.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.240
We'll start there.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.240
Okay.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.240
Okay.

38:54.240 --> 38:57.760
So these are going to speed up turnaround.

38:57.760 --> 39:02.400
You go into checkers and rallies and you're going to get out quicker, which is good because

39:02.400 --> 39:05.440
the ambiance isn't what you go to checkers and rallies for.

39:05.440 --> 39:09.780
You go so you can get your wings and your best fries in the fast food biz and you move

39:09.780 --> 39:10.780
on with your life.

39:10.780 --> 39:18.240
And this press release from January 14th proudly announces that they have, and this is the

39:18.240 --> 39:20.080
wording that they use.

39:20.080 --> 39:26.520
They've launched a new chicken sandwich platform.

39:26.520 --> 39:30.200
The mother cruncher chicken sandwich platform.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.240
It's not a literal platform.

39:32.240 --> 39:36.440
It's just a place to bounce your ideas off of, but it's the mother cruncher.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.440
Okay.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.400
And they think that you're going to love it.

39:39.400 --> 39:45.960
Let's go over to a Boston market where they are, you just said a thing.

39:45.960 --> 39:50.080
You just said a thing and you need to explain what a chicken sandwich platform is.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.960
The platform to bounce your ideas off?

39:51.960 --> 39:53.760
What the fuck are you talking about?

39:53.760 --> 39:54.760
I don't know.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.360
This is in the press release.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.360
What am I an interpreter?

39:57.360 --> 39:58.360
Okay.

39:58.360 --> 39:59.360
I'm just telling you what it says.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.360
Okay.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.360
All right.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.360
McDonald's.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.520
Let's, I'm actually going to go over to McDonald's.

40:04.520 --> 40:05.520
Okay.

40:05.520 --> 40:09.960
The McDonald's January 4th, the chicken sandwich wars aren't slowing down.

40:09.960 --> 40:13.140
Oh, they're going to roll out new chicken sandwiches in February.

40:13.140 --> 40:15.360
We've heard our customers loud and clear.

40:15.360 --> 40:18.080
We know they're craving more chicken options.

40:18.080 --> 40:22.700
We're confident all chicken fans from traditionalists to spice.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.240
That is a fucking hell of a clause.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.080
We'll discover a new menu favorite.

40:27.080 --> 40:30.120
They'll come back for time and time again.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.480
And this is all in service.

40:31.480 --> 40:36.800
They want to be the best in the biz, in the chicken wars.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.680
And they got three new sandwiches to prove it.

40:39.680 --> 40:44.400
And Erlinger, who's the president of McDonald's US.

40:44.400 --> 40:49.480
Of course, says developing a reputation for great chicken represents one of our highest

40:49.480 --> 40:51.280
aspirations.

40:51.280 --> 40:57.040
We want customers to choose McDonald's for chicken because of the unique, craveable flavor

40:57.040 --> 41:00.280
that they can only get under the arches.

41:00.280 --> 41:05.680
To get started, we listened to customers to understand our current barriers and potential.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.640
The only barrier there could be is people don't like your chicken.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.400
So they're trying something different.

41:11.400 --> 41:17.800
Here at KFC, they've launched, this is from January 7th, KFC has launched the best chicken

41:17.800 --> 41:18.800
sandwich ever.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.000
So fuck you.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.760
They weren't going to sit out the latest round of the quick service chicken sandwich wars.

41:24.760 --> 41:25.760
What?

41:25.760 --> 41:30.280
The chain introduced its best chicken sandwich ever Thursday in select markets.

41:30.280 --> 41:36.040
It's simply labeled the KFC chicken sandwich, bold.

41:36.040 --> 41:42.280
It's got a buttery brioche bun topped with crispier, thicker pickles and the perfect

41:42.280 --> 41:45.400
amount of the Colonel's real Mayo.

41:45.400 --> 41:46.400
And no chicken.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.400
No, sorry.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.600
I want to just isolate one for everybody.

41:49.600 --> 41:54.200
The Colonel's real Mayo.

41:54.200 --> 42:02.440
I did see a commercial with one of these sandwiches in it and fellas, they are not kidding about

42:02.440 --> 42:05.680
the size of these pickles.

42:05.680 --> 42:06.680
It's obscene.

42:06.680 --> 42:13.000
The size of the depth of these pickles is obscene.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Fuck I want a chicken sandwich.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Okay, go on.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.920
Zaxby's is offering General Tso's.

42:16.920 --> 42:17.920
Okay.

42:17.920 --> 42:18.920
Okay.

42:18.920 --> 42:19.920
Zaxby's.

42:19.920 --> 42:20.920
Now you have me.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.960
Now you have me Zaxby's.

42:22.960 --> 42:26.360
Zaxby's is doing General Tso's chicken wings for a limited time.

42:26.360 --> 42:27.360
Oh, not chicken sandwich.

42:27.360 --> 42:31.800
Oh, but even that, I think when it's like, we're all doing sandwiches and Zaxby's is

42:31.800 --> 42:35.080
like, we're over here fucking partying.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.640
Zaxby's has got Texas toast and napkins.

42:37.640 --> 42:41.560
You can make a fucking General Tso's sandwich if you want to get nasty.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.880
Zaxby's has an alternative to fast food.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.440
All right, bud.

42:45.440 --> 42:51.040
Zaxby's serves fresh prepared at order, hand breaded chicken fingers with Z and wings toss

42:51.040 --> 42:53.160
a variety of sauces.

42:53.160 --> 42:57.760
Zaxby's recently introduced a new signature sandwich in test markets with a choice of

42:57.760 --> 43:01.100
Zax's sauce or new spicy Zax sauce.

43:01.100 --> 43:06.840
The company has plans for a nationwide rollout because the chicken sandwich war ain't over

43:06.840 --> 43:07.840
yet.

43:07.840 --> 43:08.840
Oh boy.

43:08.840 --> 43:09.840
I have one more.

43:09.840 --> 43:15.640
Boston market, the January 19th, okay, Boston market boldly launches Nashville hot crispy

43:15.640 --> 43:25.880
chicken sandwich declaring the chicken sandwich wars are over, which was recently declared.

43:25.880 --> 43:29.760
You can't just declare that you have to kill everyone else.

43:29.760 --> 43:33.920
This is, I think this is what they are claiming they have done.

43:33.920 --> 43:42.520
Zaxby's just reassured us on this exact same day that the chicken sandwich wars are not

43:42.520 --> 43:43.520
over.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.800
Boston market leads it eventually.

43:46.800 --> 43:52.600
They are over, but it's not January 19th.

43:52.600 --> 43:58.200
Actually they're not, they're not over and Boston market says they actually are.

43:58.200 --> 44:03.640
We've entered the fray with our own take, the Nashville hot crispy chicken sandwich.

44:03.640 --> 44:08.640
It's the first crispy chicken sandwich in the company's 30 year history and it's been

44:08.640 --> 44:12.880
available for a limited time, which if you're telling me this is the sandwich to bring peace

44:12.880 --> 44:17.320
to the galaxy, you should probably keep it on the menu for a while just to limit the

44:17.320 --> 44:22.040
number of mothers and sons being separated by the grim reaper.

44:22.040 --> 44:26.820
Alongside launch, Boston market will introduce new crispy chicken BLT sandwich and crispy

44:26.820 --> 44:29.200
chicken and white gravy.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.200
That's it.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.200
Here's, here's what's up.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.200
Here's what I appreciate.

44:32.200 --> 44:36.820
McDonald's, they done took the damn grilled chicken sandwich off the menu.

44:36.820 --> 44:42.100
They said, if we're going to get, if we're going to get, if we're going to join voluntarily

44:42.100 --> 44:47.880
this chicken sandwich war, we're going to put all of our fucking resources behind it.

44:47.880 --> 44:49.680
The grilled chicken sandwich is a distraction.

44:49.680 --> 44:54.240
Everybody else is like, yeah, we also are kicking ass with our crispy chicken sandwich,

44:54.240 --> 44:57.080
but also check out this one.

44:57.080 --> 45:02.400
This one's got a zesty Italian flavors like, no, that's not the war though.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.600
Can I tell you guys what's really fucking me up right now?

45:04.600 --> 45:05.600
What's that?

45:05.600 --> 45:06.600
What?

45:06.600 --> 45:10.240
Is that we've heard from these five companies and it's like, there's been so much carnage

45:10.240 --> 45:15.680
already in the chicken wars, but we haven't heard from fucking Popeye's yet.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.400
And Popeye's launched, no, no, no, no.

45:17.400 --> 45:18.400
They launched the first shot across the galaxy.

45:18.400 --> 45:19.400
It was opening salvo.

45:19.400 --> 45:23.480
No, but this is what I'm saying is like, they launched it and if anyone's going to finish

45:23.480 --> 45:32.400
it, I have this feeling that Popeye's might actually, factually kill KFC and or, I mean,

45:32.400 --> 45:35.240
Boston market seems like they'd be the first to go, right?

45:35.240 --> 45:36.240
Then Zaxby's?

45:36.240 --> 45:37.240
Yeah.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.760
Zaxby's is going to make it pretty far, I think.

45:39.760 --> 45:40.760
I don't know.

45:40.760 --> 45:41.760
Yeah, you think?

45:41.760 --> 45:45.240
I could see them being like the, like we have these like, you know, swamp fighter techniques

45:45.240 --> 45:49.360
where it's just like, you know, like how we won the revolutionary war, right?

45:49.360 --> 45:53.360
I see Boston market is out there like, oh, we're fighting the chicken wars in like

45:53.360 --> 45:58.720
perfect, you know, formation, and Zaxby's is like, we dropped down from trees to Hansard

45:58.720 --> 45:59.720
sandwich.

45:59.720 --> 46:00.720
Zaxby's is down here in his fucking ghillie suit.

46:00.720 --> 46:05.040
Listen, Boston market is not fucking around because I want to bring you my new favorite

46:05.040 --> 46:07.080
CEO in the biz.

46:07.080 --> 46:11.280
Okay, last week we learned about a sentient potato king, so let's be careful about the

46:11.280 --> 46:12.280
words we use.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.760
Okay, let's check it out.

46:13.760 --> 46:14.760
Actually not CEO.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.480
He's president Randy Miller.

46:16.480 --> 46:20.200
It's me, Randy Miller, the president of Boston market.

46:20.200 --> 46:26.840
If you leave the market off, it's a man announcing I'm Randy Miller, the president of Boston.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.840
Deal with it.

46:27.840 --> 46:31.800
2020 is behind us and so are the chicken sandwich wars.

46:31.800 --> 46:36.280
We've been bringing the heat in our rotisserie ovens for more than 30 years and our new Nashville

46:36.280 --> 46:41.680
hot crispy chicken sandwich proves there's only room for one chicken expert in this country.

46:41.680 --> 46:42.680
Really?

46:42.680 --> 46:45.440
Boston market will always be king.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.200
Jesus God.

46:47.200 --> 46:52.580
With this new menu, we wanted to introduce music city's legendary hot sauce flavor to

46:52.580 --> 46:54.800
all our guests across the country.

46:54.800 --> 46:59.200
I brief, uh, if I may interrupt Randy, you may not to please.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.200
It's my show.

47:00.200 --> 47:06.120
I just want to say it's wild that, um, if you want to bring another city's flavor, you

47:06.120 --> 47:09.960
should probably not name your restaurant after a city.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.200
People are going to start to wonder where your allegiances lie.

47:13.200 --> 47:18.400
There's no better way to do that than alongside our legendary rotisserie chicken and a crispy

47:18.400 --> 47:23.920
chicken sandwich that will quickly become the best thing our guests and probably our

47:23.920 --> 47:28.360
competitors will have ever tasted.

47:28.360 --> 47:34.840
Our Nashville hot crispy chicken sandwich is no doubt the best sandwich out there today.

47:34.840 --> 47:35.840
There you have it.

47:35.840 --> 47:39.920
And we challenge everyone to put it to the taste.

47:39.920 --> 47:43.400
Oh, a taste test, of course.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.400
Okay.

47:44.400 --> 47:48.640
You fucking fell apart in the end Randy, I got to get so sick Randy.

47:48.640 --> 47:49.640
You have it.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.280
You were doing so good Randy.

47:51.280 --> 47:53.160
Everyone put it to the taste.

47:53.160 --> 47:54.160
A taste taste.

47:54.160 --> 47:55.160
A taste taste.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.160
Taste taste.

47:56.160 --> 48:00.240
You got to taste, taste it to waste it.

48:00.240 --> 48:01.240
Fuck.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.960
Tea in the wind.

48:03.960 --> 48:04.960
Taste taste.

48:04.960 --> 48:10.460
Hey, I'm here for my taste taste of the best music city sandwich on earth.

48:10.460 --> 48:13.600
Seems like we might need to scrap whatever we were planning for next week's episode and

48:13.600 --> 48:15.960
just like get into these crispy boys.

48:15.960 --> 48:21.360
I just want everybody to realign their focus on like why we're doing this in the first

48:21.360 --> 48:28.000
place and that is because it is unethical to eat Chick-fil-A, but nobody's really doing

48:28.000 --> 48:35.300
their weird wet flat pickle mess that I haven't eaten in many years now just from a principal

48:35.300 --> 48:36.300
standpoint.

48:36.300 --> 48:38.620
But hey, I've tried some of the other ones.

48:38.620 --> 48:43.000
I remember there was one week for a second where we all maybe got tricked for just a

48:43.000 --> 48:46.440
second into thinking Chick-fil-A had turned a corner and then like four days later they're

48:46.440 --> 48:50.680
like, hi, I'm just kidding, here's a million dollars.

48:50.680 --> 48:52.180
Just listen.

48:52.180 --> 48:54.120
I didn't eat during that period is what I'm saying.

48:54.120 --> 48:56.960
What I'm saying is I was like, oh man, this weekend I might cook.

48:56.960 --> 48:57.960
That's hope.

48:57.960 --> 49:01.880
Hope we missed the weird wet pickle mess, but like it's a principal thing, but nobody's

49:01.880 --> 49:04.280
really going for that weird wet pickle mess aesthetic.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.280
And that's kind of-

49:05.280 --> 49:07.880
It would be great if they could all get together to crush Chick-fil-A.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.080
That's what I'm saying, team up.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.080
Just yeah.

49:11.080 --> 49:15.040
That's, I will continue to bring everyone updates-

49:15.040 --> 49:17.880
From the front please.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.720
If I can just mention one more thing.

49:19.720 --> 49:25.600
This is the last one before and I just want to, Tropical Smoothie sees increased demand

49:25.600 --> 49:29.800
in Cajun shrimp menu offerings, okay?

49:29.800 --> 49:32.280
I just want to, this is the name of the press release.

49:32.280 --> 49:37.520
And then you're reading through, sounds all very reasonable.

49:37.520 --> 49:43.640
And then the first line of this story is many of its largest competitors continue to fight

49:43.640 --> 49:46.660
the long raging chicken sandwich war.

49:46.660 --> 49:52.120
And then the end of it is a quote that says, we provided a fresher flavorful alternative

49:52.120 --> 49:54.720
and it's outperforming any new food I'm in our history.

49:54.720 --> 49:58.780
Maybe 2021 will mark the end of the chicken sandwich wars.

49:58.780 --> 50:02.800
This is from January 19th also guys.

50:02.800 --> 50:09.480
I don't know what's fucking happening, but three different places say, on this exact

50:09.480 --> 50:17.360
same date, okay, Zaxby's is like, the chicken sandwich wars are really continuing.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.600
They're not over yet.

50:18.600 --> 50:21.180
And then Boston Market said, they actually are over.

50:21.180 --> 50:25.780
And Tropical Smoothie said, I don't know, maybe they are, maybe they aren't.

50:25.780 --> 50:27.360
These are not the same company.

50:27.360 --> 50:28.880
They're different companies.

50:28.880 --> 50:32.960
How the fuck did everybody just decide like, the war is on.

50:32.960 --> 50:34.320
We're calling it a war.

50:34.320 --> 50:35.720
Yes, it's a war.

50:35.720 --> 50:37.840
We're all doing a chicken sandwich war right now.

50:37.840 --> 50:40.560
And it's not over until we all agree that it's over.

50:40.560 --> 50:44.640
Is there maybe some kind of like shadowy organization that is like, actually all of these chicken

50:44.640 --> 50:49.040
places are owned by the exact same like company.

50:49.040 --> 50:53.720
And like we drum up the war just to like, I don't know, I don't know.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.000
Big Tysons.

50:55.000 --> 51:00.480
We drum up the war to get more ASMR people to do taste tests and compare the sandwiches.

51:00.480 --> 51:01.480
Mm-hmm.

51:01.480 --> 51:04.840
Hey, I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Graham Robot, thanks Graham.

51:04.840 --> 51:07.440
It's Yahoo Answers user, they're anonymous.

51:07.440 --> 51:16.080
Their name is gonna be, for this one, their name is gonna be Trey asks, family safe Scrabble

51:16.080 --> 51:18.560
game modifications.

51:18.560 --> 51:21.720
My Nana won't play the game Scrabble with us anymore because she doesn't want to feel

51:21.720 --> 51:28.400
pressured to use an unpleasant or dirty word out of desperation slash lack of other options.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.120
Just to keep the game moving along.

51:30.120 --> 51:33.520
I understand her concerns completely.

51:33.520 --> 51:37.280
Is there a way to modify Scrabble to make it safe for her to play so she doesn't have

51:37.280 --> 51:39.480
to spell a word she doesn't want to?

51:39.480 --> 51:45.460
I was thinking of either removing the P, F, V, B, T, C and D tiles or adding in a lot

51:45.460 --> 51:49.340
of the other letters from other sets of the game.

51:49.340 --> 51:52.000
Does anyone have any other suggestions?

51:52.000 --> 51:53.520
Updated two weeks ago.

51:53.520 --> 51:58.200
We don't allow dirty words, but if it is the only option left, Nana feels like she is forced

51:58.200 --> 52:00.280
to and it upsets her.

52:00.280 --> 52:01.280
Oh.

52:01.280 --> 52:08.560
Updated six hours ago, the tile swap rule is akin to gambling, so we refuse to use that

52:08.560 --> 52:09.560
rule.

52:09.560 --> 52:10.560
Oh, yeah.

52:10.560 --> 52:14.480
A lot happening here.

52:14.480 --> 52:20.840
I was jokingly going to suggest removing the F tiles, and they just done went ahead and

52:20.840 --> 52:25.600
said, hey, I'll see your joke and raise you a scary suggestion.

52:25.600 --> 52:29.640
Okay, but here's the thing, F, you remove that, what do you get rid of?

52:29.640 --> 52:30.640
You know, the big one.

52:30.640 --> 52:31.640
Fucking fart.

52:31.640 --> 52:32.640
The F bomb.

52:32.640 --> 52:33.640
F fart?

52:33.640 --> 52:37.360
If we could stop, if we could try and be very careful not to just George Carlin it up on

52:37.360 --> 52:40.300
this segment because I want us to be sort of clinical about this.

52:40.300 --> 52:48.120
If you take out the U, I feel like that's going to cover a lot more cuss words per letter.

52:48.120 --> 52:49.120
What about the K?

52:49.120 --> 52:52.880
No, the C. The C's in a lot of them.

52:52.880 --> 52:53.880
C's in a lot.

52:53.880 --> 52:54.880
C's do a lot of work.

52:54.880 --> 52:55.880
Yeah.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.520
Because you got the B word, the F word, I mean the C word.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.600
The B word being butt?

53:00.600 --> 53:03.120
No, Griffin, the five letter B word.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.800
Oh, yeah, that one.

53:04.800 --> 53:08.400
You got the D word in there.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.920
I feel like C covers a lot.

53:10.920 --> 53:13.080
C would cover a lot actually.

53:13.080 --> 53:16.000
So we've figured out that C is the nasty letter.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.660
Now bad news, that does also remove cat.

53:19.660 --> 53:23.120
So that's a problem right there.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.120
You can't use cat.

53:24.120 --> 53:26.520
You know what the fucking problem is?

53:26.520 --> 53:33.280
Is that because it's Scrabble, you would have to get the blank tiles out too because some

53:33.280 --> 53:40.840
fucking naughty boy could use those tiles and put down blank, blank, blank, K and people

53:40.840 --> 53:41.840
are like, what is that?

53:41.840 --> 53:48.040
And he'd be like, grandma, it's fuck.

53:48.040 --> 53:53.560
That right there you're looking at grandma, despite appearances, is a fuck.

53:53.560 --> 53:58.520
Or even worse, grandma's the one that plays that because it's the only legal move she

53:58.520 --> 53:59.520
has.

53:59.520 --> 54:02.200
And then she just bursts into tears.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.720
That's that one question.

54:03.720 --> 54:05.720
We don't allow dirty words.

54:05.720 --> 54:10.120
But if they're the only option, grandma feels like she has, I would argue they're not an

54:10.120 --> 54:11.120
option.

54:11.120 --> 54:14.080
If it's against the rules, that's all these games are.

54:14.080 --> 54:15.080
It's just not an option.

54:15.080 --> 54:20.320
Is it possible that secretly grandma's dying to play them dirty words?

54:20.320 --> 54:23.120
And she knows that you all are very controlling and you'll judge her.

54:23.120 --> 54:25.400
And so that's why she's gonna be like, oh, I'm so uncomfortable.

54:25.400 --> 54:30.200
Oh my God, I can't believe this is the only option, but okay, but I'm just gonna go ahead

54:30.200 --> 54:31.360
and put it down.

54:31.360 --> 54:39.480
But now grandma, you've just played nine letters all at once to make three different words.

54:39.480 --> 54:41.400
Yes, no, I know I feel terrible.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.200
But where did you get, there's like two extra letters there.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.080
I just found them under my leg.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.080
I can't believe I saw them there.

54:48.080 --> 54:55.560
I think a really great house rule for your game should be that your grandma can play

54:55.560 --> 55:04.040
cuss words, but whenever she does, nobody's allowed to say them or acknowledge that they

55:04.040 --> 55:05.800
are a dirty word.

55:05.800 --> 55:10.680
So grandma just spells out fuck on the board and everybody just kind of looks at it and

55:10.680 --> 55:16.160
then looks at each other and then quietly writes down however many points it's worth.

55:16.160 --> 55:17.160
And they just don't.

55:17.160 --> 55:18.160
Man, that's the worst part.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.160
Fuck is not worth a lot of letters.

55:19.160 --> 55:21.640
I mean, a lot of points really, when you think about it.

55:21.640 --> 55:22.640
There's not any big.

55:22.640 --> 55:26.240
Now, if you can spell it F-U-Q-U-E, now we're talking.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.440
Which is how they do it in Montreal.

55:28.440 --> 55:33.720
Oh, the French Canadian style.

55:33.720 --> 55:38.360
It sounds like maybe just, you need Scrabble, but with numbers, but then even then you can

55:38.360 --> 55:39.360
do 69.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.600
Oh, what about graph paper and pens?

55:40.600 --> 55:45.720
And you just write down whatever letters you want, but then, oh, what if the letters

55:45.720 --> 55:50.800
accidentally line up and you're doing it and you're like, well, shit.

55:50.800 --> 55:53.240
You could also have a nasty cousin.

55:53.240 --> 55:57.840
And then she calls in the nasty cousin and the nasty cousin's like, what's up, grandma?

55:57.840 --> 56:02.960
And she just gestures down to her tiles and the cousin's like, oh, say no more.

56:02.960 --> 56:06.680
I understand what needs to be done and I have the will to do it.

56:06.680 --> 56:08.280
A pinch cusser, if you will.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.240
A pinch cusser, yeah.

56:10.240 --> 56:14.320
What if it was just, hey, this no joke sounds like a pretty restrictive household.

56:14.320 --> 56:17.200
What about just one day a month?

56:17.200 --> 56:20.280
It's like the fucking purge when it comes to cussing.

56:20.280 --> 56:24.400
And it's just like that day, that's when we get out the nasty Scrabble set that's all

56:24.400 --> 56:25.400
only F-U-C-K.

56:25.400 --> 56:26.400
Yeah.

56:26.400 --> 56:31.400
But then everybody's so wild for it, it's like, grandma, you just played fnk.

56:31.400 --> 56:35.400
Yeah, I know, but I'd use your imagination and pretend.

56:35.400 --> 56:36.400
Does this say cuff?

56:36.400 --> 56:38.160
Does this say cuff, grandma?

56:38.160 --> 56:39.160
What the fuck?

56:39.160 --> 56:41.280
What does that mean?

56:41.280 --> 56:42.280
You wrote BAFTAd.

56:42.280 --> 56:43.280
BAFTAd?

56:43.280 --> 56:47.600
This just says BAFTA, like the award?

56:47.600 --> 56:48.600
Is that what you were doing?

56:48.600 --> 56:51.040
Like the British Animation and Film Award?

56:51.040 --> 56:53.240
I don't think that's what BAFTA stands for.

56:53.240 --> 56:55.320
I don't think it is either, but...

56:55.320 --> 56:56.320
No.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.160
British and Film Television Award.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.360
British and Film Televisions.

57:00.360 --> 57:04.160
It's an award for both film, television, and being British.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.880
Maybe you're like, oh man, you did some good British-ing this year.

57:06.880 --> 57:07.880
Here you go.

57:07.880 --> 57:08.880
Oh, and also-

57:08.880 --> 57:09.880
Extremely British.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.520
I enjoyed you on that television show.

57:11.520 --> 57:13.960
Baking and film and television.

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
The BAFTAd.

57:14.960 --> 57:15.960
The BAFTAs.

57:15.960 --> 57:16.960
Wait, you think that's a lid?

57:16.960 --> 57:17.960
Is that a lid?

57:17.960 --> 57:18.960
It's a lid.

57:18.960 --> 57:19.960
Let's put a lid on it.

57:19.960 --> 57:21.080
That's a lid.

57:21.080 --> 57:24.360
Thanks so much for joining us on this episode.

57:24.360 --> 57:26.360
We hope you had fun.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.520
We hope you're hanging in there and doing well.

57:28.520 --> 57:30.260
We care about you a great deal.

57:30.260 --> 57:31.260
The chicken wars are-

57:31.260 --> 57:32.260
It's tough out there.

57:32.260 --> 57:33.260
It's tough out there.

57:33.260 --> 57:34.260
I'm going to check right now.

57:34.260 --> 57:36.960
I'm going to say, I'm going to make a ruling on this, that they're not over currently.

57:36.960 --> 57:37.960
No.

57:37.960 --> 57:38.960
So please let me know how.

57:38.960 --> 57:41.760
Try as many as you can and just let me know how they are.

57:41.760 --> 57:46.400
Listen, this is a big week for us, many, many months in the making.

57:46.400 --> 57:50.640
This week, our how-to podcast book, everybody has a podcast except you.

57:50.640 --> 57:51.640
Years in the making.

57:51.640 --> 57:52.640
Years in the making.

57:52.640 --> 57:53.640
I would argue.

57:53.640 --> 57:54.640
Yeah, that's fair.

57:54.640 --> 57:58.380
It is the culmination of all of our knowledge on podcasting up to this point.

57:58.380 --> 58:04.120
That book comes out this week, comes out January 26th, and then on January 26th at 9pm, we're

58:04.120 --> 58:08.920
going to have a free virtual event to celebrate the launch of everybody has a podcast except

58:08.920 --> 58:09.920
you.

58:09.920 --> 58:11.920
We've partnered with six independent bookstores.

58:11.920 --> 58:15.500
If you pre-order from them, you'll get an exclusively designed book plate signed by

58:15.500 --> 58:19.560
one of the three of us with your copy as long as supplies last.

58:19.560 --> 58:24.320
You can go to bit.ly slash McElroy podcast book event for bookstore links and more event

58:24.320 --> 58:25.320

58:25.320 --> 58:26.320
We're really, really proud of this book.

58:26.320 --> 58:27.560
I really think you're going to like it.

58:27.560 --> 58:32.700
There's an audiobook version of it too that we did, that we narrated.

58:32.700 --> 58:37.000
If you have anyone in your life that is thinking about starting a podcast or is just a fan

58:37.000 --> 58:39.520
of podcasts, I really think they'd like this book.

58:39.520 --> 58:43.680

We've got that Cerebus Pin of the Month benefiting the NARAL designed by Zach Sterling.

The NARAL fights for access to abortion care, birth control, paid parental leave, and protections

58:57.420 --> 58:59.040
from pregnancy discrimination.

58:59.040 --> 59:02.440
We've also got that Knights Templar II sticker designed by Tyler Reed over there and a whole

59:38.280 --> 59:39.280
Thank you, Ben.

59:39.280 --> 59:46.360
The answer's user, Nadia, who asks, are you still considered a Frankenstein if all the

59:46.360 --> 59:49.520
body parts came from the same body?

59:49.520 --> 59:50.520
Oh shit.

59:50.520 --> 59:51.520
Shit.

59:51.520 --> 59:54.520
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:54.520 --> 59:55.520
Fuck.

59:55.520 --> 59:56.520
I don't.

59:56.520 --> 59:57.520
Oh man.

59:57.520 --> 59:58.520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:58.520 --> 59:59.520
Oh man.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.280
This has been my brother, my brother, may kiss your dad, square on the lips.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280
My bean.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:13.560
Okay, that was the show, hope you had some fun.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.600
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.600
Go back into the world, face the day ahead.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:32.120
