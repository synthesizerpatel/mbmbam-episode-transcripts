WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.800
Hey everybody, it's my brother, my brother and me. Welcome to the show. It's going to be a big

00:48.800 --> 00:53.440
show. We got a lot of jokes for you this week. A lot of you writing in with problems and queries

00:53.440 --> 01:00.000
and problems and we got the solutions for you. First question, how a lot of noise can you make,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.120
Justin? Well, question asked. That's a good question. Here's the noise.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.480
That's actually, that's actually healing me. That's soothing.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.520
That's not only sonically unpleasant for me, probably our listeners as well.

01:15.520 --> 01:22.320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I went to sleep at 11 o'clock last night and I feel great.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.680
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy, and I stayed out drinking a lot at a bachelor party,

01:27.680 --> 01:31.760
went to bed at like three o'clock in the morning, then woke up at seven o'clock in the morning and

01:31.760 --> 01:37.040
drove five hours to get back to Cincinnati. I mean, mine's not as good. I'm Griffin McElroy,

01:37.040 --> 01:40.640
I'm the baby brother. I just, I just drank a whole bunch. I didn't, there's not like a whole

01:40.640 --> 01:46.880
production. There wasn't a traveling element to my story. It's just, I drank all day.

01:48.160 --> 01:53.680
Actually, here's, here's what I actually did. I went to a, uh, I went to a ramp dinner last night.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.160
You guys familiar with ramps? Apparently in West Virginia. So you do sweet stunts. You jump your

01:58.160 --> 02:05.680
bikes off of my Travis Estrana. No sweet stunts. It's a West Virginia delicacy. Uh, uh, oh, onions.

02:06.320 --> 02:11.440
Oh yeah. Yeah. Sort of a, it's in the garlic, garlic family. Uh, it tastes a little bit like

02:11.440 --> 02:15.520
greens, like very garlicky greens, but you have a whole big party around them. Our friends,

02:15.520 --> 02:20.240
Kimberly and Mike has out there, they have chickens and goats that they actually get the eggs

02:20.240 --> 02:25.600
from. We bought some eggs from them. From goats? They have goat eggs? We bought goat eggs from

02:25.600 --> 02:30.480
them. They cost a hundred million dollars because they don't exist. No, we buy chicken eggs from a

02:30.480 --> 02:36.960
person that we know is still just a little, you're still just a little too up. Just like down just

02:36.960 --> 02:42.960
like a few steps. We've done this show hungover before. Have we done two people? No. Hungover?

02:42.960 --> 02:46.880
This is the most hungover the show's ever been. If I needed to bring myself down a little bit,

02:46.880 --> 02:51.280
I can just think about how excited I am about buying eggs from someone I know. That's like

02:51.280 --> 02:58.240
where my life's at. That's pretty sad. It is a little bit. Okay. Yep. There it is. Okay. It's

02:58.240 --> 03:03.360
sure as shit ain't happy. Bringing me down. Bringing me on down. I woke up this morning

03:03.360 --> 03:08.880
with diarrhea and a nose bleed. Like I don't think I should drink. Wait, hold on. To be fair,

03:08.880 --> 03:14.160
coming out of the appropriate holes. Yes. That is my favorite Hank Williams senior album. I don't

03:14.160 --> 03:20.480
think I should drink anymore. I don't think I should. I don't think my body is, is my body is

03:20.480 --> 03:28.480
no longer capable of taking my life essence on credit in the way that you do when you get super

03:28.480 --> 03:36.240
drunk and you know that tomorrow is going to suck. I, the exchange, the fucking APR on that deal is

03:36.240 --> 03:41.760
dog shit. The ROI on that particular transaction. I also know that there is nothing I could do in

03:41.760 --> 03:46.480
the future to balance that out. Like I couldn't be super drunk one night and like incredibly sober

03:46.480 --> 03:51.520
the other night. Like I can't go past zero. What was your, uh, what was your beverage of choice?

03:51.520 --> 03:58.080
Griffin? Oh, it was, uh, oh, it was maybe you've heard of it. Coors light. I got a lot of beef from

03:58.080 --> 04:06.960
my so-called friends. I got, I have to revisit the terminology now because all I called it was Coors

04:06.960 --> 04:12.800
and that's apparently not what you're supposed to call it. Yeah. It's not Coors. There's two

04:12.800 --> 04:21.120
fucking Os in there. Coors. Coors. Coors. When you say it like that, when you say it like that,

04:21.120 --> 04:30.240
it doesn't sound like bathwater. Coors is for cool people. That is that great failed campaign

04:30.240 --> 04:39.360
from the sixties. Hello, I'm Yul Brynner. Coors is for cool people. Coors is not. Unfortunately,

04:39.360 --> 04:44.240
I've just been alerted by the producer. This commercial has been canceled. Whoops. I didn't

04:44.240 --> 04:50.720
even know that happened. Coors is on the stun. Okay, I'll stop. Let's, uh, let's just hurry.

04:51.760 --> 04:57.520
Let's help someone else because you guys can't help yourselves. This question comes to us from

04:57.520 --> 05:03.920
Jacques Huit in Chicago. I handle all the UPS packages at my office. The man who delivers them

05:03.920 --> 05:10.240
is a super nice guy. We're always sharing anecdotes and jokes. He's a great mini break

05:10.240 --> 05:16.320
in the middle of the workday. Problem is, I don't know his name. It's been over a year since I've

05:16.320 --> 05:23.840
started this position and I don't know how to ask without it being awkward. Suggestions? I have a

05:23.840 --> 05:33.760
suggestion. Don't worry about it. Okay. We said we got to fucking move it a clip so I can.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.880
The reason I say don't worry about it is he's never going to quiz you on it. It's never going

05:38.880 --> 05:44.880
to come up. Like we have a male dude that rolls up to since he shakes every Tuesday during staff

05:44.880 --> 05:50.640
meeting and we applaud for him every time because he usually brings us checks and that is nice.

05:50.640 --> 05:55.520
And like, I don't know his name and I'm also going to be honest with you. I don't care. He's

05:55.520 --> 06:00.880
the male guy that I clap for. We have our exchange. He goes away. It's great. I also think he thinks

06:00.880 --> 06:07.120
we're all assholes because I think he thinks we're applauding like ironically. And in fact, you are

06:07.920 --> 06:16.480
applauding sincerely. Because you're theater jerks. But I don't know a way to clap. I don't

06:16.480 --> 06:21.600
know two types. I don't know a way to clap and simultaneously say, but I mean it. There's no way

06:21.600 --> 06:29.040
to not clap ironically anymore. It's 2013. Every clap is ironic. There's a great method you can

06:29.040 --> 06:35.200
use here that I have used before is to introduce yourself. Go with this. I don't know if I've

06:35.200 --> 06:43.120
introduced myself before. My name is Jeffrey and he'll be like, oh, my name is UPS. It will be so

06:43.120 --> 06:48.080
weird. You're going to wonder how you didn't catch that before when his name turns out. My name is

06:48.080 --> 06:55.520
Eustace Paul Stevenson. His name is just ups. What's up? I'm big ups. They call me down at

06:55.520 --> 07:02.000
the factory. It's not a nickname. My parents are drunks. I think, though, if you do that,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.960
maybe if you got to start off with something like, you know, you come in every day and I don't,

07:06.960 --> 07:10.080
you know, and we've never been properly introduced. I don't think you could say,

07:10.080 --> 07:13.520
I don't believe we've been introduced because that makes it seem like you forgot that.

07:14.880 --> 07:19.520
He also knows how bad it is to be in this situation. He also doesn't like that you

07:19.520 --> 07:23.120
don't know his name. I'm assuming Jacquie is wearing a nametag of some sort.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.840
Or that she fucking signs for packages.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.600
Signs for packages. Yeah. Okay. Ask him to sign for this one.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.440
That's a fun game.

07:31.440 --> 07:37.120
Say, can you maybe sign for this one with your name? Are you wanting to know because like for

07:37.120 --> 07:43.440
flirting or just like, but she's trying to dip her pen and come. Well, she. Okay. Hold on. Her.

07:43.440 --> 07:50.160
She has the ink. You got to start the metaphor over. She wants to spill her ink.

07:50.160 --> 07:57.040
She wants to have her company inkwell dipped in by his cock. Wait.

07:59.440 --> 08:03.520
We'll get it back. She wants to have sex with it. They want to have sex together.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.280
You don't know that's not true.

08:05.280 --> 08:10.160
Well, why else would she want to know his name? There are myriad reasons.

08:10.160 --> 08:14.240
Name one that doesn't involve them fucking. Christmas card.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.800
Yeah. Like you're going to give a Christmas card to UPS man. Next.

08:17.760 --> 08:22.400
I'm writing a check for you for Christmas, for your Christmas bonus.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.960
Nobody has ever done that. That's like old wives tale.

08:24.960 --> 08:29.440
Oh, and also nobody bonuses a UPS dude.

08:29.440 --> 08:34.480
Yeah. Well, they bonus them in the sense that they fucking bones them.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.920
They bones them.

08:35.920 --> 08:39.920
Why are you so sex obsessed? I'm trying to trying to keep this show clean.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.680
Yeah. Griffin gets that Coors up in me.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.000
I've got fucking, uh, I turned into a mountain. It's like,

08:46.000 --> 08:50.320
it's like drinking the mountains frost and it just gets so ribald.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.200
You guys. Okay. So you guys tip your mailman obviously.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.960
Never. No. Okay.

08:54.960 --> 09:01.200
Have never garbage man. No. I, I left a nice dresser on the French too.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.880
I don't think I think they think that is a chore actually.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.560
I know no one tips me. Why doesn't anybody tip me?

09:08.560 --> 09:12.480
Yeah. I think you're, you're supposed to tip wives for people in,

09:12.480 --> 09:15.200
in like service industries. But here's the thing in this damn age,

09:15.200 --> 09:18.080
I don't even know that we have the same dude every day.

09:18.080 --> 09:23.200
I got her except for UPS. Like I know that the UPS lady at, uh,

09:23.200 --> 09:26.720
since he shakes is the same woman every week, she has very distinctive hairstyle

09:26.720 --> 09:29.520
and she's hard to miss. And so I know that she's the same one.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.640
It's not the uniform. Well, no, I'm saying that like,

09:32.640 --> 09:36.800
I don't confuse her with other UPS people. I'm with you. I'm with you.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.680
But like, as far as like my first of all, I never see my garbage,

09:39.680 --> 09:42.240
our garbage men. They're like a mystery to me.

09:42.240 --> 09:48.640
I, but see, here's my thing. I get pretty, I get pretty buckwild with the things

09:48.640 --> 09:53.440
that I leave to be thrown away that have not been like properly bagged or anything.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.120
So I, for me, it, a lot of it is dealing with residual guilt.

09:57.120 --> 10:01.920
I'll leave like just, just stacks of cardboard boxes everywhere.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.840
Or like my Amazon. Do you tear them down though?

10:04.480 --> 10:06.560
What? No, I don't tear them down. I tip it.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.240
You just like build a fort out there and like hang a sign that says like your job.

10:10.240 --> 10:16.320
It's not that far off. Last, last week I left a cardboard box full of broken glass

10:16.320 --> 10:21.680
that I wrote broken glass on. Then you just, no Justin, you went,

10:21.680 --> 10:24.880
you went above and beyond there. You went above and beyond.

10:24.880 --> 10:29.760
You, you gave him fair warning that, Hey, don't stick your paw in here.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.040
You big angry bear. Dirty syringes.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.320
I don't think they root for, I hope not at least.

10:36.320 --> 10:41.120
Have you not seen the Emilio SOS Charlie Sheen movie? That's all they do.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.680
They root for trash. What movie?

10:44.640 --> 10:47.840
Oh God. Is it called like minute work? I believe.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.400
But yeah, basically they're garbage men that end up getting caught up in some kind of

10:52.400 --> 10:55.680
a political scandal. But at the beginning of the movie,

10:55.680 --> 10:58.880
there's like going through people's trash and finding naked pictures of people.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.600
It's a really weird movie. I'm glad they could work together though

11:03.600 --> 11:05.760
on something. That must have been exciting.

11:05.760 --> 11:10.240
That's what this podcast, it's my brother, my brother and me of Emilio Estevez movies.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.480
You guys want a Yahoo? Please.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.480
Have we been doing this for an hour yet?

11:16.480 --> 11:23.600
It was sent in by Emily Wall. Thank you, Emily.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.920
It's by Yahoo answers user Yasser, who asks,

11:28.240 --> 11:30.480
building a terminator. Experts only.

11:32.880 --> 11:37.440
If you are a troll or stupid, then get the hell out of this question. Experts only.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.760
The entire internet vacates the room. Bye.

11:41.040 --> 11:41.920
Later. Hello?

11:41.920 --> 11:44.240
Hello? Operator? Operator?

11:44.240 --> 11:46.800
Let me just refresh them. Nope, still no users.

11:46.800 --> 11:52.160
I've decided I want to build a terminator T800 and I need some help how to make this happen.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.200
First things first, where can I get the parts for it?

11:55.200 --> 11:59.360
Is there any sites where they sell body parts for any models of terminators?

11:59.360 --> 12:02.400
Second question, where can I get the schematic for a terminator?

12:03.120 --> 12:09.600
I would be very thankful for the one that gives me the right info and I will reward you with 10 points.

12:10.480 --> 12:10.980
Whoa.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.420
Whoa. That sounds good.

12:14.420 --> 12:19.460
That's an exchange rate that is, I don't know what Yahoo points are used for.

12:20.420 --> 12:24.580
That is, yeah, I don't know what the conversion is.

12:24.580 --> 12:30.260
I feel like I am owed roughly 3 billion Yahoo points for all the work we've done.

12:33.060 --> 12:38.580
I think this person is putting the cart before the horse a little bit in asking where they can

12:38.580 --> 12:41.380
get parts and then asking how to get schematics.

12:41.380 --> 12:44.820
I also want to say that I feel like it's a little cut corner to be like,

12:44.820 --> 12:49.380
I want to build a terminator. Also, where can I get pre-built body parts for it?

12:49.940 --> 12:53.780
It's like, hey man, if you're not going to do it from scratch, then what's the point?

12:53.780 --> 12:56.980
Well, maybe they lack the tools for this particular fabrication.

12:56.980 --> 13:02.180
Seriously, they want a snap together model. You know what I mean? They don't want to carve it.

13:02.180 --> 13:09.300
Like K'nex. You remember K'nex? He wants that, but it builds a future robot.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.620
You could probably build a terminator out of K'nex,

13:11.620 --> 13:15.380
but all he would be able to do is lift a ball to the top of a roller coaster.

13:15.380 --> 13:19.140
Yeah, which in and of itself would be pretty baller.

13:19.140 --> 13:22.340
But I guess then you couldn't really define him as a terminator

13:22.340 --> 13:25.460
because he would not in fact be terminating anything.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.340
Except for your boredom.

13:28.340 --> 13:34.900
What if when the ball makes it to the top of the thing, a big laser comes out of his head

13:34.900 --> 13:38.420
and kills people? I haven't seen the Terminator movies.

13:38.420 --> 13:39.940
I've never seen the Terminator movies.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.140
I swear to God, I haven't.

13:41.140 --> 13:42.420
You've not seen any of them?

13:42.420 --> 13:47.860
None, no. I watched half of the first one and like only two people got killed and I was like, bored.

13:47.860 --> 13:51.140
I watched the animated Saturday morning cartoon version.

13:51.140 --> 13:54.660
Okay, let me tell you guys the story of the Terminator. I will start from the beginning.

13:54.660 --> 14:05.940
Sarah and her son, John, Sarah Connor is pregnant with a baby.

14:05.940 --> 14:10.020
And Arnold Schwarzenegger is a robot, a series 800 Terminator.

14:10.020 --> 14:10.980
Is he the dad?

14:11.860 --> 14:13.220
What? No.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.140
Sorry, is he the dad?

14:15.140 --> 14:16.420
No, he's a robot.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.780
So, robots can't... Sorry to keep interrupting you, Justin.

14:19.780 --> 14:20.580
Sorry, for the bit.

14:20.580 --> 14:25.700
Is the baby half robot?

14:25.700 --> 14:28.820
Well, I've seen Bicentennial Man.

14:30.660 --> 14:37.460
And robots can come and they can create babies just like a normal person.

14:37.460 --> 14:41.460
Okay, let me start again and this time I will replace the Terminator

14:41.460 --> 14:44.340
with Robin Williams' robotic character from Bicentennial Man.

14:44.340 --> 14:46.180
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

14:46.180 --> 14:55.540
Okay, so Bicentennial Man, as portrayed by Robin Williams, travels, is in a war,

14:55.540 --> 14:58.420
in our future, is in a war with humanity.

14:58.420 --> 14:58.660
Okay.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.100
Robots versus humans, right?

15:00.100 --> 15:03.060
Does he have his skin and stuff yet or is he still like the creepy servo-bot?

15:03.060 --> 15:04.900
At this point, he has skin.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.460
Okay, so we're close to the end of the movie.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.100
We're close to the end of the movie, it's in our future,

15:10.100 --> 15:12.820
but he's about to go to the beginning of the movie, which is our past.

15:12.820 --> 15:16.980
Okay, back when he didn't have, when he was just metal.

15:16.980 --> 15:20.580
John Connor is leading humanity's revolt against robots.

15:20.580 --> 15:21.700
Is this the baby?

15:21.700 --> 15:22.820
The baby is doing this?

15:24.500 --> 15:25.460
Yes, yes.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.380
A baby from inside the womb?

15:27.380 --> 15:31.220
Fully grown John Connor is leading humanity's revolt against the robots, okay?

15:31.220 --> 15:33.380
So the robots are like, this is going bad.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.140
I don't think we're gonna win this one.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.900
And they're like, well, let's give up.

15:36.900 --> 15:37.460
First off.

15:38.660 --> 15:40.020
Well, this is the thing.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.780
The robots never give up, okay?

15:41.780 --> 15:44.340
But here's the thing, I don't see the robots sitting around a table like,

15:44.340 --> 15:45.700
listen guys, we're blowing it.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.100
Listen guys, I put a lot of thought into this.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.100
Listen, we had a good run.

15:50.100 --> 15:50.820
In my gut.

15:50.820 --> 15:51.860
This is what happens.

15:51.860 --> 15:56.340
So listen, so they make a bunch of robots that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

15:57.220 --> 16:03.460
And now Arnold Schwarzenegger is a T-800, but he's the 101 model.

16:03.460 --> 16:06.740
So like his series is like his robotic abilities,

16:07.380 --> 16:10.900
and that 101 refers to like his flesh covering,

16:10.900 --> 16:12.420
which all look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

16:12.420 --> 16:15.460
So they sent him back in the past to kill John Connor's mom,

16:17.140 --> 16:19.140
which seems harsh.

16:19.140 --> 16:19.940
It seems harsh.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.060
T2, Terminator 2.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.820
And that's the end of the movie?

16:24.820 --> 16:26.340
They send him back and say, good luck?

16:26.340 --> 16:28.740
And the movie is like, thanks, I'll do what I can.

16:28.740 --> 16:41.140
And so then, okay, so then T2, they try it again with a robot made of liquid.

16:41.140 --> 16:44.260
But by this point, the humans have their own Arnold Schwarzenegger,

16:44.260 --> 16:48.660
and they send him back to protect him from that.

16:48.660 --> 16:50.500
And that's John Connor's dad.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.660
That's debatable.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.020
Is John Connor's his own dad?

16:54.580 --> 16:57.860
Oh shit, he's his own dad.

16:57.860 --> 17:06.340
I saw the scene in the original T1 where Arnold Schwarzenegger goes to that woman's door

17:06.340 --> 17:08.020
and is like, are you Sarah Connor?

17:08.580 --> 17:10.180
And she was like, yes.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.580
And he's like, all right, let me take out my chewing gum.

17:12.580 --> 17:13.060
She was like-

17:13.060 --> 17:14.660
I said, are you Sarah Connor?

17:14.660 --> 17:15.620
Yes, I am.

17:15.620 --> 17:20.660
And then he's like, oh, sorry, are you the Sarah Connor that specifically,

17:21.700 --> 17:25.060
the one that has a baby and the baby,

17:25.060 --> 17:33.860
and are you pregnant right now with a baby that just feels like a few apocalyptic leader of men?

17:33.860 --> 17:37.220
And she's like, no, that's not, I'm like 60 years old.

17:37.220 --> 17:40.420
I've clearly had menopause already, it's clearly not me.

17:40.420 --> 17:44.420
And he's like, okay, I apologize for the mistake, have a nice day.

17:44.420 --> 17:52.020
I love the tasteful, the hedges in your yard, they're good.

17:52.020 --> 17:55.940
While I'm here, do you know any other Sarah Connors that may be-

17:55.940 --> 17:58.020
Do you have like a daughter you named after yourself?

17:58.020 --> 18:00.660
Do you have a, did you name a daughter after yourself?

18:01.220 --> 18:06.100
By the way, I have good news about Robot Jesus.

18:06.100 --> 18:09.300
He's a new Jesus that will-

18:09.300 --> 18:10.740
I'm just gonna leave some pamphlets.

18:10.740 --> 18:14.900
In a hundred years or so, it's really gonna, it's just sweep the nation.

18:14.900 --> 18:20.020
You could get on board super early with Robot Jesus.

18:20.020 --> 18:24.580
I could leave you a few excerpts from the cyber.

18:24.580 --> 18:30.660
That's a cyber Bible that Robot Jesus wrote for you from the future.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.140
No, okay.

18:34.020 --> 18:34.740
Just thought I'd try.

18:35.620 --> 18:36.740
I'm gonna go.

18:36.740 --> 18:40.660
His oil will wash your heart clean if you want that.

18:42.740 --> 18:46.740
That was a fucking super, super good impression we all did together.

18:46.740 --> 18:49.940
We all did increasingly good impressions.

18:49.940 --> 18:55.540
If we had a fourth brother, he would be indistinguishable from Arnold Schwarzenegger

18:55.540 --> 18:58.020
because of diminishing returns and statistics.

18:58.020 --> 19:02.100
You know, a lot of people don't know this, but doing an Arnold Schwarzenegger impression

19:02.100 --> 19:03.140
is really easy.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.460
Just lower your voice slightly and mumble.

19:05.460 --> 19:06.580
And apparently-

19:06.580 --> 19:09.540
The only hard part is fighting the temptation to say,

19:09.540 --> 19:12.020
anybody wanna pee their pants out?

19:12.020 --> 19:12.740
Definitely.

19:12.740 --> 19:13.780
It is your same-

19:14.500 --> 19:16.980
I just have an impression of a big man.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.980
And then I bust it out.

19:20.980 --> 19:22.660
That is also my Hall Hogan.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.020
Do your Jesse Ventura.

19:24.020 --> 19:26.980
Hello, I'm also a governor.

19:29.620 --> 19:33.620
It's hard because it's also really close to my impression I'm an adult.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.780
Like what an adult sounds like.

19:35.780 --> 19:38.180
All grownups to me sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.740
So Griff, just side note.

19:41.620 --> 19:46.740
We make like a bunch of loud noise so it's easier to find the edit mark for when you cut out

19:46.740 --> 19:49.300
that giant section where we talk about Terminator.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.000
Nah.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.740
No, we'll just move on.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.820
My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year and a half,

19:54.820 --> 19:58.260
yet somehow in all this time we've never had, quote, a song.

19:59.380 --> 20:03.300
We like a lot of the same music and there are several songs that fill me with warm fuzzies

20:03.300 --> 20:04.660
because they remind me of him.

20:04.660 --> 20:08.500
But it seems a little gauche to pick one and declare this will be our song.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.220
How do normal humans pick their song?

20:11.940 --> 20:13.220
Where can we find one?

20:13.860 --> 20:15.540
Not knowing anything about our relationship,

20:15.540 --> 20:17.220
do you have any suggestions?

20:17.220 --> 20:19.140
Romantic Rhapsody in the Rockies.

20:21.060 --> 20:24.340
The only people that do that are like 12.

20:24.340 --> 20:25.460
Rachel and I do not.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.660
We do not know like what our first dance song is going to be.

20:28.660 --> 20:29.300
Yeah, that's the thing.

20:29.300 --> 20:35.380
Teresa and I, we had never really contemplated it until the first dance question came up.

20:35.380 --> 20:38.820
We're going to go with Nice and White Satin by the Moody Blues.

20:38.820 --> 20:39.860
It's a good one.

20:39.860 --> 20:43.300
Yeah, but I mean, that's more of like that's because that's her favorite band

20:43.300 --> 20:45.620
and it's like a really appropriate first dance song.

20:46.820 --> 20:49.220
And it's hard because I already found the best one ever.

20:49.220 --> 20:51.780
So it's like, look, you know, how do you top?

20:51.780 --> 20:55.540
Yeah, it's we're all Travis and I are basically fighting for second now.

20:55.540 --> 20:57.220
Yeah, it's all just a battle for second.

20:57.780 --> 21:03.380
I wish that picking a song for a couple was like it was just randomly assigned.

21:03.380 --> 21:06.980
It had nothing to do with like your emotional connection to the song or anything.

21:06.980 --> 21:09.460
You think you should get out of like a Zoltan machine?

21:09.460 --> 21:09.700
Yeah.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.660
Carnival.

21:10.660 --> 21:15.300
Like if you like your song is Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen and you're like, but why?

21:15.300 --> 21:16.180
I you know what?

21:16.180 --> 21:21.860
We did have our first dance to Lurol's Stay Awhile with me, but I think other songs have

21:21.860 --> 21:27.700
probably become more emblematic of our like I think they would that we identify with them

21:27.700 --> 21:29.540
more as a couple over time.

21:30.100 --> 21:34.900
I think that you're you're probably there's nothing that says that you're going to find

21:34.900 --> 21:39.700
your song that early because I think that part of your song is that it represents a

21:39.700 --> 21:40.980
lot of what your relationship is about.

21:40.980 --> 21:45.060
And I think it takes a while for you to understand what your what your dynamic is.

21:45.060 --> 21:48.340
And you know, I also think a lot of songs may interrupt Justin.

21:50.180 --> 21:50.500
Sure.

21:51.780 --> 21:56.180
The problem with that and the problem with this question in general.

21:56.180 --> 21:57.300
May I interrupt?

21:57.300 --> 21:57.860
Yes.

21:57.860 --> 21:58.100
Okay.

21:59.780 --> 22:00.900
Oh, you did double back.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.420
What I did there is I've reversed.

22:04.420 --> 22:05.620
That's a reversing.

22:05.620 --> 22:07.300
You did a reverse reverse.

22:07.300 --> 22:10.660
Oh, that could be that could be your slide could be your song.

22:12.340 --> 22:13.460
Maybe this is our song.

22:13.460 --> 22:14.100
Oh, fuck.

22:14.100 --> 22:19.220
That would be the fucking best first dance wedding song ever is like the fucking Cupid

22:19.220 --> 22:24.820
Shuffle comes on and you and your new significant your new life partner are like fucking start

22:24.820 --> 22:25.940
doing it and other people get up.

22:25.940 --> 22:28.020
You're like, what are you doing down?

22:28.020 --> 22:28.820
This is our day.

22:29.940 --> 22:31.940
Nobody else can do the chicken dance, but us.

22:31.940 --> 22:32.820
It's our song.

22:33.940 --> 22:34.900
It's our dance.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.300
It's let us gogm style and peace.

22:37.860 --> 22:39.860
But that's a good choice.

22:39.860 --> 22:44.500
So the issue, though, with the parameters of the question is that I think you can totally

22:44.500 --> 22:50.020
have a song until you actually quantify it as this is our song.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.100
And then it's like, well, now it's not anymore.

22:52.100 --> 22:52.420
Why?

22:52.420 --> 22:53.380
That doesn't make sense.

22:53.380 --> 22:57.460
Well, because suddenly it's like it's like it's like a quantum physics thing.

22:57.460 --> 23:02.020
Like, as soon as it's observed, it stops being true because now it's become cliche.

23:02.020 --> 23:08.340
I would argue that like the only thing that makes it your song is that observation of

23:08.340 --> 23:09.140
it being your song.

23:09.140 --> 23:12.900
And it is completely something that is independent of that.

23:12.900 --> 23:16.260
It is actually by observation.

23:16.260 --> 23:19.940
I would rather have it, though, because it's like every time this song comes on, you and

23:19.940 --> 23:23.860
I sing along to it and like we know this is a thing, but we don't say it out loud.

23:23.860 --> 23:29.700
I would never go to one of my friends and be like, yeah, Teresa, my song is, uh, my

23:29.700 --> 23:34.020
sacrifice, take it, take it to the limit, take it to the limit.

23:34.020 --> 23:35.860
I saw there's no dignity of a black street.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.140
It's pretty good.

23:37.700 --> 23:45.300
You're you are thinking about having a song as something that you would like widely report

23:45.300 --> 23:47.780
to people in day to day conversation.

23:47.780 --> 23:52.340
I think that whatever your song is, should be a very private discussion and maybe not

23:52.340 --> 23:54.900
something you, you know, share with other people.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.300
I think it's a very intimate, intimate decision.

23:57.300 --> 24:00.900
But then they're going to, I mean, eventually it's going to come out, right?

24:00.900 --> 24:03.300
You think you can, it's hard to keep that secret, huh?

24:03.300 --> 24:06.500
And what are you going to do if you guys get married and you do have that as your first

24:06.500 --> 24:10.100
dance song and you just be like, don't, we're not going to play it, but we're going to imagine

24:10.100 --> 24:11.700
it and you guys will never know.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.900
Could everyone leave the room, please?

24:12.900 --> 24:13.700
We're going to have our first dance.

24:13.700 --> 24:21.220
You're tying our song to our first dance song at a wedding, which is like very different

24:21.220 --> 24:21.940
conversation.

24:21.940 --> 24:24.340
I feel like whatever your song is can be transitional.

24:24.340 --> 24:26.340
Like I think it can evolve over time.

24:26.340 --> 24:32.420
Because what if they release a song the day after you get married that is like, like,

24:32.420 --> 24:34.740
what about two people and they're named Jack and Diane?

24:34.740 --> 24:39.700
And like literally the day after they get married, the cougar drops Jack and Diane on

24:39.700 --> 24:42.100
us and they're like, of course this is our song.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.700
We grew up in the heartland and shit.

24:43.700 --> 24:44.660
All that stuff, baby.

24:44.660 --> 24:47.380
Can we mulligan it?

24:47.380 --> 24:51.540
Guys, I'm a little, I'm actually a little worried about how the cougar, has the cougar

24:51.540 --> 24:56.820
been, have you noticed John Cougar Mellencamp, like following us around because this song

24:56.820 --> 25:00.340
is, is like almost biographical of our lives.

25:00.340 --> 25:01.620
It is like a literal.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.020
Fuck that's my exact order.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.580
I heard the new John Cougar Mellencamp song.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.580
Then I looked to my husband.

25:18.580 --> 25:23.140
I said, can you believe this and it just becomes an echo as you're doing it.

25:23.140 --> 25:25.940
And then it's like an R Kelly song.

25:25.940 --> 25:27.620
It's like that doctor who episode.

25:28.180 --> 25:30.100
John Cougar Mellencamp is taking my words.

25:31.940 --> 25:32.980
He's using my voice.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.540
We've got to throw John Cougar Mellencamp off the train.

25:38.260 --> 25:40.900
Three brothers making a podcast together.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.980
Sing about my song and they're still talking about it.

25:45.540 --> 25:46.900
And he's the fourth brother.

25:46.900 --> 25:49.780
I'm jerking off outside one of their windows.

25:50.740 --> 25:53.860
They'll never know which one, but it's Travis.

25:56.900 --> 25:57.460
Oh shit.

25:59.620 --> 26:00.820
Hey Travis, it's me.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.220
John Nothin Mellencamp.

26:04.340 --> 26:06.500
I was about to say, what are you doing here?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.580
What if he just switched to Jonathan Mellencamp?

26:10.580 --> 26:18.340
Oh, I thought you said John Nothin Mellencamp.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.420
John Rest Mellencamp.

26:22.420 --> 26:28.180
John Cougar Mellencamp actually drew a rest in there in the middle of his name.

26:28.180 --> 26:31.460
There's a picture of the musical notation for a rest.

26:32.660 --> 26:33.140
Christ.

26:34.900 --> 26:39.780
Every time he says his name, you can actually hear him pronounce the beat in between.

26:39.780 --> 26:42.340
Hi, I'm John Mellencamp.

26:42.340 --> 26:45.060
Hi, I'm John Mellencamp.

26:46.340 --> 26:48.020
He actually taps his leg twice.

26:49.860 --> 26:50.500
Mellencamp.

26:53.620 --> 26:55.220
Welcome to my home.

26:55.220 --> 26:56.580
We want to change your name.

26:57.220 --> 27:04.180
We like your songs, but we're wondering if you could change your name to Johnny Cougar.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.220
Like absolutely not.

27:07.220 --> 27:07.860
Absolutely no.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.060
Absolutely not.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.780
Listen, we've been we've been we've been working.

27:11.780 --> 27:14.660
We've been workshopping your image, your brand.

27:14.660 --> 27:16.500
You got to drop one of your names.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.940
It's just it's just too it's just too long.

27:19.940 --> 27:23.460
From now on, I will be Cougar Mellencamp.

27:23.460 --> 27:26.660
We highly recommend losing Mellencamp.

27:26.660 --> 27:29.140
We highly, if you're gonna lose one, I don't know.

27:29.140 --> 27:34.020
I'm not really married to Cougar because it's like not what my parents fucking called me.

27:36.020 --> 27:37.140
I think I might lose Cougar.

27:37.140 --> 27:38.260
Ooh, I'm not.

27:38.260 --> 27:39.620
Oof, not sure about that.

27:39.620 --> 27:43.620
This is I'm going to say that I really like that when they split up.

27:43.620 --> 27:47.220
I actually like Cougar stuff better now that he's not with John Mellencamp.

27:47.220 --> 27:50.420
I know you're saying that there is an entity out there.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.300
You're like Crosby, Stills and Nash.

27:54.580 --> 27:56.500
It's a wicked knot like that.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.260
Yeah, it's John Cougar and Mellencamp.

27:59.060 --> 28:01.460
John Cougar and his excellent Mellencamps.

28:01.460 --> 28:08.100
His legal name is John Cougar and he actually married a woman named Mellencamp and he's

28:08.100 --> 28:08.980
super progressive.

28:08.980 --> 28:09.860
It's hyphenated.

28:09.860 --> 28:13.140
Yeah, John Cougar Mellencamp of the Cougar Mellencamp.

28:13.140 --> 28:17.380
I'd say it's already bad enough that I worked for eight years to get my doctorate and you

28:17.380 --> 28:18.820
won't let me put doctor in my name.

28:21.140 --> 28:21.640
Big wigs.

28:23.140 --> 28:25.300
Actually, he's a Cougar doctor.

28:26.660 --> 28:28.340
He's a Cougar doctor, Dr. Cougar.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.180
Why didn't he go to veterinary school?

28:30.180 --> 28:34.740
If he ever drops out of music, I think he has to try to reestablish Johnny Cougar.

28:34.740 --> 28:38.020
I think you have to see if you can get people to call you that in like a regular day-to-day

28:38.020 --> 28:38.980
context.

28:38.980 --> 28:41.940
I've been in a serious relationship with my boyfriend for a couple of years.

28:41.940 --> 28:44.660
We're planning our first weekend getaway for the early summer.

28:44.660 --> 28:47.540
I'm excited, but feel a bit discouraged.

28:47.540 --> 28:51.700
The first time we talked about the specifics of what we want to do, we had an argument.

28:51.700 --> 28:54.420
Moving forward, I want to minimize the stress of this.

28:54.420 --> 28:56.900
Do you have any advice on how to prepare for this?

28:56.900 --> 29:01.140
Do you have any advice on how to plan a trip with a significant other smoothly?

29:02.340 --> 29:02.840
No.

29:03.460 --> 29:07.700
It is always going to be a little stressful.

29:07.700 --> 29:08.740
Yeah, that's the thing.

29:08.740 --> 29:12.340
I'm not trying to paint a yes, dear, everybody loves Raymond scenario.

29:12.340 --> 29:16.260
The fact of the matter is when you get two people and everybody's going to-

29:17.060 --> 29:19.460
I'm not going to let you besmirch everybody loves Raymond.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.060
You can dump on yes, dear all you want.

29:21.060 --> 29:21.620
That's fine.

29:21.620 --> 29:22.020
That's great.

29:22.020 --> 29:26.180
Oh, yeah, because Mike O'Malley isn't having it fucking hard enough already without having

29:26.180 --> 29:28.260
Travis's buttons dog piled on him.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.900
Listen, everyone but Mike O'Malley on that show was dumb.

29:30.900 --> 29:35.460
Mike O'Malley was great on that show, but everybody's going to have their own agendas

29:35.460 --> 29:36.660
and want to do their own stuff.

29:36.660 --> 29:40.420
And it's just the way that happens, you know, from like the kind of music you're going to

29:40.420 --> 29:43.780
listen to as you drive down there to like what you're going to do once you get there.

29:43.780 --> 29:46.020
It's it doesn't need to be a fight.

29:46.020 --> 29:48.980
It just needs to be like a compromised discussion kind of deal.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.660
I'll tell you what my tip.

29:50.660 --> 29:54.340
Stop giving a shit about anything other than not dying.

29:54.340 --> 29:54.660
Yeah.

29:54.660 --> 29:58.580
As long as you like don't get killed on the trip, who cares what you do as long as you're

29:58.580 --> 29:59.140
together.

29:59.140 --> 30:03.060
That's what that's what that's we don't go in with an agenda.

30:03.060 --> 30:06.740
We try to avoid agendas when traveling as much as possible because that's where you'll

30:06.740 --> 30:07.540
get tripped up.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.900
Like that's how you get on.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.580
That's how you get on the fucking case.

30:11.620 --> 30:14.180
That's how you get on a case is you have an agenda.

30:14.180 --> 30:18.740
If you don't have an agenda, then you can just sort of take things as they come, you

30:18.740 --> 30:20.420
know, free, free in the wind.

30:20.420 --> 30:28.100
I don't think our dad like dad it out on too many like that issue, like dad, dad problems.

30:28.100 --> 30:33.780
But one thing that he very, very much dadded was when we would go on trips and he would

30:33.780 --> 30:39.460
like just get the metric for success for the trip would become this crazy thing.

30:39.460 --> 30:44.740
Like if we don't find a fucking steak and shake in this goddamn Florida town where I

30:44.740 --> 30:49.060
heard a rumor, I heard a rumor that there's a steak and shake and we are going to drive

30:49.060 --> 30:50.340
around for two hours until we find it.

30:50.340 --> 30:51.620
And that's how it'll be perfect.

30:51.620 --> 30:56.900
This is actually watch dad like respond less than last two questions.

30:56.900 --> 30:57.380
Oh, yeah.

30:57.380 --> 30:58.260
It's like, oh, yeah.

30:58.260 --> 31:00.020
He's in his own world of failure.

31:01.140 --> 31:03.060
He's in his own like distinct.

31:04.260 --> 31:10.980
We once drove around for two hours out of our way on a road trip, two hours to find

31:10.980 --> 31:12.980
this barbecue place called Maurice's.

31:13.860 --> 31:14.740
Do you guys remember this?

31:14.740 --> 31:21.140
And it ended up being like the sauce was mustard base and it was foul.

31:21.140 --> 31:24.580
I'm sure there are people here listening who are like devotees of Maurice's.

31:24.580 --> 31:28.340
But like we drove two hours out of this place and I would not eat a single thing on the

31:28.340 --> 31:28.660
menu.

31:28.660 --> 31:31.220
I think I ate like baked apples or something.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.020
It was a nightmare.

31:32.020 --> 31:35.060
Well, like that was not a barbecue aficionado.

31:35.060 --> 31:39.300
I am not to be and I mean, I catch myself doing that, too, because like I'll get hung

31:39.300 --> 31:44.100
up on some like little stupid detail like we got to be back at the hotel by five so

31:44.100 --> 31:45.380
we could do this by six.

31:45.380 --> 31:46.820
And it's just stupid.

31:46.820 --> 31:48.740
Like it means not what I've learned.

31:48.740 --> 31:53.940
If I may get savvy for a moment, what I've learned is that the difference between like

31:53.940 --> 31:58.100
you going on a day trip somewhere is like an adventure, you know, hanging out versus

31:58.100 --> 32:00.020
going on a trip with a significant other.

32:00.660 --> 32:03.460
Really, it's to spend time with them.

32:03.460 --> 32:06.260
Everything else is just kind of secondary.

32:06.260 --> 32:06.900
You know what I mean?

32:06.900 --> 32:10.900
It's it's you guys going together that's important and everything else that is kind

32:10.900 --> 32:11.620
of fall into place.

32:11.620 --> 32:16.180
Even if you just like end up going and sitting in a hotel room for a week but enjoying each

32:16.180 --> 32:20.660
other's company, that's you know, that's better than fighting about every little detail.

32:20.660 --> 32:25.780
If price permits, I would suggest going to a place that is all inclusive because that

32:25.780 --> 32:28.420
is basically just being on like a vacation conveyor belt.

32:29.060 --> 32:33.940
It's like it's like being on like a factory line of vacation where they just put the

32:33.940 --> 32:35.380
vacation stuff on you.

32:35.380 --> 32:41.620
And you're in a really good position now chronologically because you can go to a place

32:41.620 --> 32:45.700
without a very specific plan and just kind of yelp what you're looking for, whatever

32:45.700 --> 32:49.460
you need, whatever you're in the mood for at that moment, or just ask somebody when

32:49.460 --> 32:50.020
you get there.

32:50.020 --> 32:53.140
You know, don't ask the concierge because you know he's getting kickbacks.

32:53.780 --> 32:58.900
But you know, I think the problem you had was sitting down for a planning sesh.

32:58.900 --> 32:59.700
Yeah, don't do that.

32:59.700 --> 33:03.460
Just decide where you want to go, decide where you're going to stay, and then you know,

33:03.460 --> 33:04.420
figure it out together.

33:04.420 --> 33:07.460
Don't, don't, I have this saying that I came up with.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.220
It's don't sweat the small stuff.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.340
That's good, Justin.

33:10.340 --> 33:10.660
Thanks.

33:11.620 --> 33:14.900
And it's all, and the other thing is it's all small stuff.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.500
That doesn't fucking make any sense.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.900
How can you not sweat the small stuff if it's all small stuff?

33:18.900 --> 33:21.060
Then it's just everything's average stuff.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.580
Except for racial injustice.

33:22.580 --> 33:23.780
That's the one thing.

33:23.780 --> 33:25.140
You can sweat racial injustice.

33:25.140 --> 33:28.420
You do have to sweat racial injustice if that should pop up during your weekend away.

33:29.140 --> 33:32.340
We sat down for a planning session and just evolved into racial injustice.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.500
Griffin, you got any more yahoos?

33:34.500 --> 33:35.780
Oh, we should probably go to the money zone.

33:36.340 --> 33:37.220
Let's get there.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.740
Welcome to the money zone, everybody.

33:50.740 --> 33:56.180
We've been thrown into a tizzy by Will O with this message for Ainsley.

33:56.180 --> 34:01.380
Uh, because the message is this, and I will read it without comedy.

34:01.380 --> 34:06.420
Therefore, if it is a joke, we are legally, we're on sound ground.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.980
If it's serious, we're legally protected.

34:10.500 --> 34:15.700
Even though you were mutilated in that boating accident and left deformed from the waist up

34:15.700 --> 34:20.580
and never venture into public out of fear and shame, I still love you very much and wish

34:20.580 --> 34:26.340
you the hap-hap-happiest birthday you deservedly deserve.

34:26.340 --> 34:33.460
Uh, Will, I'm sure will be writing to us soon to ask how to apologize for making, uh,

34:33.460 --> 34:36.180
light of his other boating accident.

34:36.180 --> 34:38.740
I don't think you can be deformed from the waist up.

34:38.740 --> 34:44.660
I think there's some vital shit up there that, like, once you start tweaking with the recipe

34:44.660 --> 34:50.980
a little bit, like, once you start, once you start adding in little, little tweaks to the

34:50.980 --> 34:56.500
schematics, then once you start fucking with that, you're donezo.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.340
Waist up is super important.

34:58.340 --> 35:00.420
Waist up's like all the good stuff's there.

35:00.420 --> 35:01.940
Uh, so happy birthday-

35:01.940 --> 35:02.980
I used to believe it's true.

35:02.980 --> 35:03.940
I'm sorry.

35:03.940 --> 35:05.140
Happy birthday to Ainsley.

35:05.140 --> 35:09.940
We're really sorry, either really sorry about your accident or really sorry about Will.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.420
Either way, we're sorry, but happy birthday.

35:12.420 --> 35:13.940
Travis, what about this other one?

35:13.940 --> 35:14.980
What's the story here?

35:14.980 --> 35:17.220
This next one's to Ryan from Zabs.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.060
Happy birthday to Ryan Alexander.

35:19.060 --> 35:23.140
He introduced me to your awesome podcast, which just adds to how much awesomer he's

35:23.140 --> 35:24.180
made my life.

35:24.180 --> 35:27.860
Thanks for helping me fill the void between NBNB AM episodes.

35:27.860 --> 35:32.100
Also, I hope you like this gift because it's exhausted my budget for your birthday.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.940
Hugs and nags, hashtag.

35:33.940 --> 35:35.220
Why didn't you read that word?

35:35.940 --> 35:37.300
Because I don't know what it means.

35:38.180 --> 35:38.680
Wow.

35:38.680 --> 35:43.000
To fill the void between NBNB AM episodes, self-sajax.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.360
Maybe that's his handle on the street.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.040
Oh, like a CB handle?

35:48.040 --> 35:49.560
It's his graffiti tag.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.480
I thought that said, I thought that said hugs and nugs.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.280
Hugs and nugs.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.480
Me too.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.400
We have 420 on the brain.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.440
Did you guys spliff out?

36:02.440 --> 36:05.960
Did you guys fire up a J and smoke yourselves?

36:05.960 --> 36:11.160
I did, I ground up my weed and I snorted it.

36:11.160 --> 36:15.560
I actually celebrated 420 the way I've celebrated everyone for the past few years.

36:15.560 --> 36:21.640
Reading Facebook statuses of friends who are too old to smoke weed and are very mournful

36:21.640 --> 36:22.440
about it.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.520
I get a lot of that on the old wall now.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.080
A lot of like, hey, you kids have fun.

36:27.080 --> 36:32.840
I got too many responsibilities, but go ahead and smoke them if you know where to buy them.

36:32.840 --> 36:37.640
I just boarded up the windows so that when all the reefer zombies attacked, I would be

36:37.640 --> 36:38.120
safe.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.800
Yeah, you got to look out for number one.

36:39.800 --> 36:45.080
Do you guys remember back in the early days when there was like a cabal of our listeners

36:45.080 --> 36:48.760
who thought that we were pot high pretty much all the time?

36:48.760 --> 36:53.080
And I remember there was once where Justin took a pretty heinous sip of his coffee and

36:53.080 --> 36:57.880
people thought it was a water, like a water pipe, like a water pipe for weed, not for

36:57.880 --> 36:58.920
water transportation.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.600
I still remember that.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.920
For weed, not for water transportation.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.320
I still don't know where to buy that.

37:05.320 --> 37:10.840
So if you have some or just want to sell me some, that would be great.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.720
If only it weren't so hard to find people that sold weed.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.560
For me, it is.

37:15.560 --> 37:20.680
Unless you're my FedEx guy or the lady at Starbucks, that's it.

37:20.680 --> 37:24.440
That's the only people that could sell me weed that I interact with regularly.

37:24.440 --> 37:29.080
Okay, I thought you were saying aside from those two dealers, I don't know any other

37:29.080 --> 37:30.120
one.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.800
Aside from my local librarian.

37:32.440 --> 37:35.240
People at libraries gotta be selling weed a lot, right?

37:35.240 --> 37:38.520
Yeah, why else would they be fucking interested in reading?

37:39.160 --> 37:40.200
Spring has sprung.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.800
A young man's fancy has turned to love.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.400
And you know what that means?

37:45.960 --> 37:47.480
It's dildo time.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.880
Hey, happy dildo day, everybody.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.960
This is dildo week here on my brother, my brother, and we were talking about-

37:51.960 --> 37:55.400
The dildo has come out of his shell to see his shadow.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.600
And now it's time for spring.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.720
Came out of a butt.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.960
Do you guys like huge dildos?

37:59.960 --> 38:04.760
Give me some sort of metric, because that could mean, like, my definition of what a

38:04.760 --> 38:07.720
huge dildo is, is probably different than what yours is.

38:09.240 --> 38:14.040
If it looks like something that the eye of Sauron would appear above, like that's the

38:14.040 --> 38:15.400
kind of thing I'm talking about.

38:15.400 --> 38:19.240
I actually prefer a lot of really small dildos.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.160
Is that better for you?

38:21.880 --> 38:22.760
And it's just cuter.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.400
It's fun.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.280
It's like a dildo.

38:26.280 --> 38:29.160
It's fun. It's like a cup of pins on a desk.

38:29.800 --> 38:34.280
You know in that one scene in Fantasia where Mickey Mouse chops off the broom and it becomes

38:34.280 --> 38:35.480
a bunch of brooms?

38:35.480 --> 38:36.520
It's like that.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.240
But with dildos.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.720
Do they sell that on Extreme Restraints?

38:39.720 --> 38:40.760
Do they sell-

38:40.760 --> 38:43.880
Do they sell a young man's fancy on Extreme Restraints?

38:43.880 --> 38:44.680
Can you buy that?

38:45.800 --> 38:47.720
Can I buy my innocence back on Extreme Restraints?

38:47.720 --> 38:50.440
I want to tell you guys about one very special dildo to me.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.160
This is the Annihilator X.

38:53.160 --> 38:59.080
X, and you guessed it, XL dildo.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.360
This thing-

39:00.360 --> 39:02.360
The extra X is for excellence.

39:02.360 --> 39:06.920
This man looks like he is cradling a poodle.

39:06.920 --> 39:11.000
A black, shiny poodle in front of his crotch.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.440
It is 18 inches long and it is nine pounds.

39:14.440 --> 39:15.000
Fuck!

39:15.000 --> 39:16.040
How do you even-

39:16.040 --> 39:17.720
How do you fucking operate that?

39:17.720 --> 39:19.800
You gotta have a trusted friend.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.640
You have to have an accomplice for this bilbo.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.680
Or a running start.

39:26.760 --> 39:28.280
Either way, I guess.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.320
Yeah, I don't really understand.

39:31.320 --> 39:35.000
Let me zip on out of the comments and see-

39:35.000 --> 39:38.440
The comments are all just like, no, no, no, no.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.120
I love how flexible this one is and I love taking it all the way to the base.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.520
I felt like I would explode.

39:48.520 --> 39:52.280
Now, folks, when you are leaving a product review on extremistrace.com,

39:52.280 --> 39:55.400
it is so important to make sure it doesn't sound like you're bragging.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.720
And this one seems very braggy to me.

39:57.720 --> 39:58.920
It's like a backdoor brag.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.080
I couldn't-

40:01.080 --> 40:02.120
It's super good, though.

40:02.120 --> 40:02.520
That was a super-

40:02.520 --> 40:07.160
My husband, many years ago, suggested a threesome with his very well-endowed best friend.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.480
My husband's small, only six inches long.

40:09.480 --> 40:21.720
Uh-oh.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.360
So she's still into threesomes, I guess.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.520
And anyway, my husband, a few years ago, bought me this.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.720
And OMG, it's huge and intense.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.520
I was lucky.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.480
I have sex a lot.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.240
But with a very big cock.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.560
But this, OMG, it's on a different level.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.160
And so am I.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.920
I am addicted to feeling stretched and maxing my pussy out.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.680
Justin is no longer reading review.

40:44.680 --> 40:45.560
He is just-

40:45.560 --> 40:46.760
He is just letting-

40:46.760 --> 40:48.520
He's forming thoughts-

40:48.520 --> 40:52.120
Just forming thoughts in his brain and using his mouth to express them.

40:53.960 --> 40:58.120
I actually love the power move of telling your wife you're gonna have a threesome

40:58.120 --> 41:00.200
with your well-endowed friend.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.680
Your well-endowed friend gets out his wiener.

41:02.680 --> 41:05.320
And then he turns his back for just a second.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.280
And that's when you whip out the Annihilator XXXL.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.040
It really kills the appeal of Greg.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.720
Show Greg where he belongs.

41:13.720 --> 41:17.000
It also kills the person that it plunges into.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.160
Are there any reviews?

41:19.160 --> 41:24.520
Like, I am typing this as I'm using it for the first time and am now dead.

41:26.360 --> 41:31.480
This period, I'm hitting the period, clicking the send button and dying.

41:31.480 --> 41:40.840
This person says, when they said Annihilator and XXXL, they were not at all joking.

41:41.720 --> 41:42.840
That would be a pretty-

41:42.840 --> 41:44.680
This is the loved ones.

41:46.200 --> 41:50.840
We came home, David had been shucked like a pistachio.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.760
But he sure did look happy.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.560
Thanks, Extremers.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.800
He died with a smile on his face.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.600
Like a toddler ripping apart a fruit roll up.

42:00.600 --> 42:04.440
Just split right in twain he was.

42:04.440 --> 42:05.320
Oh, man.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.520
Go check out ExtremeRestraints.com.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.400
There are good things on there.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.840
Not that this isn't a good thing, but there are things on there

42:14.840 --> 42:17.160
that probably won't kill you starting from your butt.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.800
That's kind of the more extreme-

42:19.800 --> 42:22.600
That is as extreme as you can possibly go.

42:22.600 --> 42:26.600

42:37.000 --> 42:39.720
Get there, get your savings, and get yourself killed.

42:40.360 --> 42:41.800
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

42:41.800 --> 42:42.760
Absolutely.

42:42.760 --> 42:44.760
This Yahoo was sent in by Alicia M. M.

42:44.760 --> 42:45.560
Thank you, Alicia.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.600
It's by fucking Yahoo Answers user, John.

42:48.600 --> 42:49.560
I just got tired-

42:49.560 --> 42:52.600
I just got exhausted from sitting forward in my chair.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.600
Rough day.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.200
Rough afternoon.

42:56.200 --> 43:04.520
Uh, John asks, is it normal for a guy, 24, to kiss cats in a pet store?

43:05.960 --> 43:09.640
I go to a pet store, and when I find the cats I like, I hold him,

43:09.640 --> 43:13.000
may hug him, and kiss him all through his body except face.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.640
As if I was kissing a dear friend of mine.

43:15.640 --> 43:16.520
Is that normal?

43:16.520 --> 43:18.280
Or is that unacceptable and perv?

43:18.920 --> 43:23.080
I'm sorry to Justin and Travis that I didn't read this question beforehand

43:23.080 --> 43:26.040
and did not catch the part where he says he kisses everywhere except the mouth.

43:26.680 --> 43:27.720
Like, pretty woman.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.160
Okay, first things first.

43:33.960 --> 43:39.400
Normal is an illusion invented by corporate America to keep you docile.

43:39.400 --> 43:40.120
Yeah.

43:40.120 --> 43:40.920
Second-

43:40.920 --> 43:43.560
I mean, that is like day one.

43:43.560 --> 43:44.360
That's day one.

43:44.360 --> 43:47.400
Don't talk about normal in day-to-day life.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.440
I don't even want to hear about that.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.040
That TV show, The New Normal?

43:50.040 --> 43:51.400
I don't want to hear about that.

43:51.400 --> 43:54.760
No, The New Normal is the old normal because normal doesn't exist.

43:54.760 --> 44:00.600
That said, on behalf of kitty cats, don't-

44:00.600 --> 44:01.560
Please don't kiss them.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.120
Hey, please don't kiss the kitty cat that you don't-

44:05.400 --> 44:09.560
that you don't have, that you don't support fiscally and emotionally.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.840
You know, we all own cats.

44:10.840 --> 44:13.560
There's a very good chance this gentleman has kissed our cats all over.

44:14.440 --> 44:17.400
But except as long as it's not in the head, then I can look that cat in the face.

44:17.400 --> 44:20.920
I can respect my cat still as a man.

44:26.200 --> 44:30.520
Is it normal for a guy 24 to kiss strangers at a bus stop?

44:30.520 --> 44:31.080
It's not.

44:32.040 --> 44:32.760
It's not-

44:32.760 --> 44:34.280
It is not okay to do that.

44:34.280 --> 44:39.560
Is it okay to go to a nursery and just kiss all the babies I see everywhere except the face?

44:39.560 --> 44:40.360
Super not okay.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.080
Super not normal 24.

44:43.080 --> 44:47.560
Normal, again, is an illusion that typical is the word.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.880
Typical behavior, no.

44:49.880 --> 44:56.200
Is it orthodox behavior to smooch all the kitties everywhere, all over their bodies?

44:56.200 --> 45:01.640
If I'm running a pet store and some guy smooches one of my kitties, I assume he's buying it.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.640
I'm like, where's your credit card?

45:03.640 --> 45:04.920
Because you just bought a kitty.

45:04.920 --> 45:08.360
You point to the poster by the wall and it says, you smooch it, you bought it.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.040
You smooch it, you bought it, weird beard.

45:10.040 --> 45:14.040
You can tell, too.

45:14.040 --> 45:20.600
If you go to a pet store and you look at a cat and it has that smooched look, you're gonna buy it

45:20.600 --> 45:22.120
because it looks smooched.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.880
It's just been smooched hair.

45:23.880 --> 45:24.840
Come on.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.120
All through his body.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.760
This guy is fucking hoisting these-

45:30.760 --> 45:36.920
You're the clerk at this pet store and you see this guy and he's going like up and down the tail.

45:36.920 --> 45:40.440
Like he's demolishing a corn cob or something.

45:40.440 --> 45:43.640
Just not missing a kernel of unsmooched fur.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.040
And you are just jerking it.

45:46.040 --> 45:47.800
Oh, why would you do that?

45:49.240 --> 45:51.400
No, I mean, the clerk is jerking.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.200
It's not weird.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.120
Oh, if the clerk's jerking, then it's fine.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.800
That's the new normal.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.920
That's the new normal.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.120
We've just established it.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.280
Is that what that show's about?

46:00.840 --> 46:01.400
Oh, man.

46:02.760 --> 46:03.880
Every week they pick a new-

46:04.840 --> 46:05.720
So there's two guys.

46:05.720 --> 46:06.280
Yes.

46:06.280 --> 46:10.440
They go to the pet store and every week one of the guys picks a different animal.

46:10.440 --> 46:11.400
Maybe it's an iguana.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.720
Maybe it's a big bird.

46:13.720 --> 46:16.120
And then he smooches it while the other one masturbates.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.760
Would you guys watch a reality show where the whole thing is how many animals can a person

46:24.760 --> 46:27.000
kiss in a pet store before they're ejected?

46:27.800 --> 46:28.920
Before they ejaculate?

46:28.920 --> 46:29.560
Is that what you said?

46:31.800 --> 46:33.480
No, I said before they're dejected.

46:33.480 --> 46:34.200
That's the most-

46:34.200 --> 46:36.040
They look at themselves and give up.

46:37.800 --> 46:38.280
God.

46:40.600 --> 46:41.800
How could you do this?

46:42.520 --> 46:44.360
How could you do this thing?

46:44.360 --> 46:45.160
Just buy one.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.440
Let me drop my age in here.

46:46.440 --> 46:49.240
I'm gonna kiss these cats all over their body.

46:49.240 --> 46:53.000
Let me just drop my age in here because that could be a defining factor.

46:53.000 --> 46:53.800
I'm not 12.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.080
But I'm not 45, which I-

46:57.080 --> 46:57.560
You know what?

46:57.560 --> 46:59.080
Now that I say it, it would be stranger.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.320
That would be stranger, wouldn't it?

47:01.320 --> 47:08.200
But if I see a 24-year-old kissing every cat in the room, I assume that he's trying to

47:08.200 --> 47:09.160
rush a fraternity.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.680
Well, 24 is a little old for that.

47:13.320 --> 47:15.960
Oh, he was held back a few years.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.520
Okay, see, now we're developing some fiction.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.600
Now we have a story.

47:20.600 --> 47:24.600
Is it possible he's been offered a job in this pet store and he's asking if it's a

47:24.600 --> 47:25.160
weird job?

47:25.160 --> 47:29.720
Is there maybe- is he maybe watching someone do this as he furiously types into Yahoo and

47:29.720 --> 47:34.360
tries to find out if he should, in fact, eject this person from his store, as he suspects?

47:34.360 --> 47:39.720
He and a friend saw it, and now they're debating about its relative normalcy.

47:39.720 --> 47:41.800
I don't know, it seemed fine to me.

47:41.800 --> 47:44.200
He looked about 24, so that's-

47:44.200 --> 47:45.560
I don't see the big deal.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.880
That's about the right age to do it, if you're gonna do it.

47:47.880 --> 47:50.200
You're gonna do it, might as well do it at that age.

47:50.200 --> 47:50.700
24.

47:50.700 --> 47:54.300
We're all looking for direction at that age.

47:54.300 --> 47:59.580
Kissing animals is the weirdest- if you kiss- if you let your dog lick your mouth, I'm done

47:59.580 --> 48:00.300
with you.

48:00.300 --> 48:03.100
I think it's- I think that- I don't know, I don't have-

48:03.100 --> 48:05.100
I think it's cute, their mouths are cleaner than our mouths, Griffin.

48:05.100 --> 48:07.100
Yeah, Griffin, read a book.

48:07.100 --> 48:11.100
It's really cute when that happens, because they're giving you puppy smooches.

48:11.100 --> 48:13.100
Okay, I don't want to talk about this anymore.

48:13.100 --> 48:14.300
I'm getting yucked out.

48:14.300 --> 48:17.100
Puppy smooches.

48:17.100 --> 48:24.220
Okay, at my college, there is a sweet old lady who works reception.

48:24.220 --> 48:28.380
She likes to give people nicknames, usually harmless ones, like normal.

48:28.380 --> 48:29.500
Here's the problem.

48:29.500 --> 48:35.340
I guess she just started watching Pawn Stars, because now she's saying I look like Chumlee

48:35.340 --> 48:36.140
from that show.

48:36.140 --> 48:39.020
I think it's Chumlee, you're saying it like the Street Fighter.

48:39.020 --> 48:41.900
Okay, Chumlee.

48:41.900 --> 48:44.540
She's saying I look like Blanca, which is strange.

48:44.540 --> 48:48.620
It's something you can- has begun calling me that.

48:48.620 --> 48:54.140
I know, as a big guy, I don't have a good crop to pick from in celeb lookalikes.

48:54.140 --> 48:56.140
Oh, man.

48:56.140 --> 48:57.900
This lady is like 90.

48:57.900 --> 49:01.820
How could I tell her politely that I don't appreciate being compared to a dude who looks

49:01.820 --> 49:05.100
like he showers in grease and seems to have mild brain damage?

49:06.620 --> 49:12.460
At this point, I will settle for Kevin Smith, and that's from Backhanded in Houston.

49:12.460 --> 49:15.580
Yeah, you've got a- yes, it is bad.

49:15.580 --> 49:16.700
I'll give it to you straight.

49:16.700 --> 49:19.900
You got a bad- you got dealt a bad hand here, Chumlee.

49:19.900 --> 49:24.140
But on the other hand, it could be so much worse.

49:24.140 --> 49:25.180
It could be worse.

49:25.180 --> 49:26.460
It couldn't, though.

49:26.460 --> 49:27.020
It couldn't.

49:27.020 --> 49:28.780
He's really- that's a really rough one.

49:28.780 --> 49:34.540
That's a really pretty bad one, because it's like- it's not only- it's not only like a

49:34.540 --> 49:40.300
bad reference to a person who's bad, it's a reference to a bad show, and like by acknowledging

49:40.300 --> 49:43.340
that you get it, people are going to think you watch Pawn Stars.

49:43.340 --> 49:44.940
And Pawn Stars is awesome.

49:44.940 --> 49:50.620
I think it would be cool to force her hand on this, though, because say that you don't

49:50.620 --> 49:56.860
know- you don't understand the reference, and force her to explain the similarities

49:56.860 --> 49:57.420
that you have with Chumlee.

49:57.420 --> 50:00.620
Say, is Chumlee like some kind of like young, handsome, funny guy?

50:00.620 --> 50:07.020
Yeah, young, rakish, well-endowed college student, 24, loves to kiss cats?

50:07.020 --> 50:11.260
Is it because he's some kind of a young stud who really loves old broads?

50:11.260 --> 50:14.380
Make that old broad look you in the face and tell you you're fat.

50:14.380 --> 50:20.460
You look- he's a person who is- looks like he is made of hams, and that's what I think

50:20.460 --> 50:20.860
of you.

50:22.460 --> 50:22.940
Enjoy your day.

50:22.940 --> 50:28.060
Make her say that, and then use that, because you're going to turn your life around.

50:28.060 --> 50:31.660
You're going to walk into this lady's office one day, and she's going to be like,

50:31.660 --> 50:35.820
Chumlee, and you're going to be like, more like Guile, because you're going to have like

50:35.820 --> 50:36.620
big guns.

50:36.620 --> 50:41.500
And she's going to pull down her big old glasses, and just look at you and go, damn!

50:41.500 --> 50:43.820
She's going to pull down her big old panties.

50:43.820 --> 50:48.700
You're going to have sex with that old woman.

50:48.700 --> 50:50.140
That's your new thing.

50:50.140 --> 50:53.500
Every time you're in training, I want you to imagine having sex with that old woman,

50:53.500 --> 50:54.620
giving her the old what for.

50:55.340 --> 50:56.060
You know what I mean?

50:56.060 --> 51:00.300
That's not- that is not something I want to think of.

51:00.300 --> 51:04.380
I don't want to think about this person on The Biggest Loser like, think- you got to

51:04.380 --> 51:05.420
use your motivation!

51:05.420 --> 51:06.860
And like, oh, fucking, I got it.

51:06.860 --> 51:09.500
I'm ready to go.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.180
I'm going to seduce this old lady.

51:11.180 --> 51:15.580
You have a huge boner, and there are other people waiting to get on the treadmill.

51:15.580 --> 51:16.620
Bingo's in the corner.

51:16.620 --> 51:17.340
He's watching you.

51:20.060 --> 51:21.260
I don't know this Bingo.

51:21.260 --> 51:22.060
Should I know Bingo?

51:22.060 --> 51:25.100
Everyone needs to know Bingo to get any of my references anymore.

51:26.060 --> 51:28.620
Everyone fucking do some- that's your homework.

51:28.620 --> 51:31.740
That's your take home for this episode of the podcast.

51:31.740 --> 51:35.580
Everybody look up who- everybody Google Bingo Biggest Loser, and you're going to see him.

51:36.140 --> 51:40.540
You're going to see this living ball of sunshine that God has given us on this earth.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.460
It's a handsome young man.

51:42.460 --> 51:45.260
And then when I mention him on the show, and when I mention The Biggest Loser, you're

51:45.260 --> 51:47.340
going to be- you're going to feel erudite.

51:47.340 --> 51:54.060
So that's what we want you to work on for the- for next week, for the seven days you

51:54.060 --> 51:55.260
have to do without us.

51:56.060 --> 51:58.380
We so appreciate you joining us once again.

51:58.940 --> 52:00.460
Thanks for making it to the end of this one.

52:00.460 --> 52:06.060
This was- I'm not saying it was good or bad, but it was- I just was- man, I'm so tired.

52:06.060 --> 52:09.740
It just- I think that after you edit it, maybe it'll be funnier.

52:09.740 --> 52:12.620
After I edit it, it'll be- Yeah, it'll be 12 minutes long.

52:12.620 --> 52:13.820
12 minutes long.

52:13.820 --> 52:15.660
What happened to all that stuff about Robocop?

52:15.660 --> 52:19.500
I'll think to myself as I listen to it afterwards, because that's the thing I do.

52:20.780 --> 52:21.660
I know.

52:21.660 --> 52:22.940
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

52:22.940 --> 52:27.100
Thank you to Daniel Franzen, Patty Windsor, Y.V.

52:27.100 --> 52:33.340
Ritesh, Dan Bowden, Phil Rose, and Nicole.

52:33.340 --> 52:34.700
That's blue Nicole, mind you.

52:35.820 --> 52:38.700
And H.L. Peacock, everybody tweeting about the show.

52:38.700 --> 52:39.500

52:43.260 --> 52:43.820

52:43.820 --> 52:47.180
It's bit.ly forward slash itsmabimbam.

52:48.540 --> 52:52.700
Super big thanks again to everybody who donated during Maximum Fun Drive.

52:52.700 --> 52:56.540
We did super well for the network.

52:56.540 --> 53:01.660
The people who pick their shows after they donate, we did super, super well for that.

53:01.660 --> 53:05.980
And so it's, I don't know, it's really flattering not only that people are willing to support

53:05.980 --> 53:11.580
us, but that we are on this network of people who I think are the funniest people in the

53:11.580 --> 53:15.420
world, and that you guys are supporting us.

53:15.420 --> 53:21.260
I want to say also a couple of thank yous to people who have mailed us things.

53:21.260 --> 53:26.940
That's P.O. Box 54 Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

53:26.940 --> 53:31.340
We got a postcard from Rachel, who was visiting the Crazy Horse Monument.

53:32.300 --> 53:37.580
So she sent us a picture of a Native American, so we appreciate that.

53:37.580 --> 53:43.580
And a giant thank you to Justin Gray, who, if you don't know Justin Gray, he made two

53:43.580 --> 53:47.900
amazing posters from my brother, my brother and me, like year in review posters.

53:47.900 --> 53:48.460
Oh, shit.

53:48.460 --> 53:53.580
And he printed three of each of them and sent them to us, and I have them.

53:53.580 --> 53:54.620
Ah, I want those.

53:54.620 --> 53:56.060
I know, I'll get them to you.

53:56.060 --> 54:02.620
And if you have not seen those, it's burntobuild.blogspot.com.

54:03.820 --> 54:05.100
Forward slash.

54:05.100 --> 54:05.980
Forward slash.

54:05.980 --> 54:07.900
Admin, forward slash.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.340
So make sure you go look at those.

54:11.340 --> 54:12.460
I wish you would make more.

54:12.460 --> 54:13.740
I'd love for people to be able to do it.

54:13.740 --> 54:15.180
Well, don't fucking guilt the guy.

54:16.060 --> 54:18.140
Well, no, I'm saying like let's get rich.

54:18.140 --> 54:18.940
I'm disappointed.

54:18.940 --> 54:20.300
I'm disappointed in his output.

54:20.300 --> 54:21.340
We need to merch up.

54:21.900 --> 54:22.700
Merch up.

54:22.700 --> 54:23.260
We do.

54:23.260 --> 54:23.580
For real.

54:23.580 --> 54:28.380
We haven't merged in a while, and people are always like, well, when's your new hit coming?

54:28.380 --> 54:30.220
And we're like, soon.

54:31.100 --> 54:31.600
Soon.

54:32.940 --> 54:35.020
If you got some merch you'd like to see from us, let us know.

54:35.980 --> 54:42.780
Also, speaking of, big thank you to hoodwinkedfool on the Twitters.

54:42.780 --> 54:49.260
They remixed our Daft Punk song from last week's episode and posted a video of it on Facebook.

54:49.260 --> 54:49.740
Oh, fuck.

54:49.740 --> 54:50.460
We'll post the link again.

54:50.460 --> 54:51.420
Yeah, I got to listen to that.

54:51.420 --> 54:52.140
It's so good.

54:52.140 --> 54:53.020
Oh, yeah, it's good.

54:53.020 --> 54:53.900
It's hype.

54:53.900 --> 54:55.020
And thank you to you.

54:55.580 --> 54:58.300
Did you already thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of the theme song

54:58.300 --> 55:00.540
It's a Departure off the album Put the Days to Bed?

55:00.540 --> 55:05.900
No, I want to thank, I really want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for this song.

55:06.460 --> 55:06.960
Good.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.180
And thank you to you so much, Griffin.

55:09.180 --> 55:10.460
Do you have one more question for us?

55:10.460 --> 55:13.500
Yeah, I can, let me scrounge one up here.

55:14.540 --> 55:15.740
Just dig into the scraps.

55:15.740 --> 55:17.980
And this Yahoo was sent in by David Pounce.

55:17.980 --> 55:18.700
Thank you, David Pounce.

55:18.700 --> 55:24.060
It's by Yahoo Answers user John889743 who asks,

55:26.940 --> 55:29.340
Is Eminem the new Socrates of our times?

55:31.980 --> 55:33.260
I'm Justin McElroy.

55:33.260 --> 55:34.380
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:34.380 --> 55:35.580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:35.580 --> 55:36.620
He's been my brother, my brother.

55:36.620 --> 55:37.420
May he kiss your dad.

55:37.420 --> 55:51.180
It's cool way on the lips.
