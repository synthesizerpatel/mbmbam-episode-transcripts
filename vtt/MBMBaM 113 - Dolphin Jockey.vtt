WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:51.280
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, your headquarters for the free

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Fred Willard effort. Is effort what we're going with? That seems kind of inert.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.160
I mean, I feel like we could have had alliteration there, but

01:02.800 --> 01:17.680
free Fred Willard fun, won't you? Willard wiener, why? What? What? We lax.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.520
McElroy is my middle brother. My youngest brother is Griffin McElroy. This is their voices.

01:27.520 --> 01:32.560
This is what they sound like. Thank you for this. The lower one is Travis. He,

01:33.680 --> 01:40.080
a few issues. Can I enumerate my issues? Why don't you recap? Give us the quick version.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.960
Fred Willard went to an adult movie theater and masturbated, and then he got fired from

01:45.760 --> 01:52.640
public television and radio. Right. So, enumerated list of issues. One,

01:52.640 --> 01:59.600
fucking layoff. Two, just chill out. Two, Frederick. Listen, a lot of people have been drawing,

01:59.600 --> 02:04.000
and by a lot of people, I haven't been following this closely. I have been, mistakenly, but then I

02:04.000 --> 02:07.760
remedied my thought process. A lot of people have been drawing comparisons between this and the Paul

02:07.760 --> 02:15.840
Rubin's Jerkoff accident incident of 1996. When was it? It was early. It was 21 years ago. For

02:15.840 --> 02:22.960
fuck's sake. You deal with the fact that someone was born on the day that Pee Wee Herman was

02:22.960 --> 02:28.640
arrested and can share a cocktail with someone over the fact that Fred Willard was arrested for

02:28.640 --> 02:36.480
the exact same crime. Back then, it was rough and tumble because he was a kid star, and he was

02:36.480 --> 02:47.360
baiting much like a kid star wouldn't do. But this was also in 1973. This is, hey Fred, it's 2012,

02:47.360 --> 02:53.200
sir. Frederick, you can do this at home. You can do this in front of your computer. Well, see,

02:53.200 --> 02:58.320
that brings me to my first issue with the whole thing, which is a pretty broad issue. Why the

02:58.320 --> 03:03.120
fuck are there still adult theaters? Yeah, it's a pretty broad issue. Why doesn't he just get

03:03.120 --> 03:09.280
himself a pretty broad? You're a famous man. You've got some money in the bank. Once you go

03:09.280 --> 03:14.960
out to the local dancing halls and meet a lady your own age, where are these theaters even

03:14.960 --> 03:22.480
operating? Can I tell you the bigger double question? This is in Los Angeles, right?

03:22.480 --> 03:29.440
I don't have no other crime to be worrying about other than my boyfriend Willard trying to hang.

03:29.440 --> 03:35.760
Other than my boyfriend Willard trying to hang? Go bust some real criminals.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.680
I'm willing to bet that wherever in any town there is an adult theater,

03:39.680 --> 03:44.000
that adult theater constitutes the seedy underbelly of that town.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.040
Now, are we casting dispersions because he was at this adult theater or because he was

03:49.040 --> 03:53.920
jerking it so right at this adult theater? I've heard people say in his defense that

03:53.920 --> 03:59.600
he was not jerking it right. He was just there and the police did a walkthrough and saw a famous

03:59.600 --> 04:05.840
person and arrested him. No matter what, fuck it. Because A, if he wants to be at an adult theater,

04:07.680 --> 04:12.560
that's his prerogative. He comes from a classic, the bronze age of America,

04:12.560 --> 04:16.560
when everybody was jerking off all the time, everywhere, on everything.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.760
It was the greatest jerk-oration. It was our greatest generation.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.960
But at the same time, even if he was jerking it, what else are you going to do in there?

04:24.960 --> 04:29.520
You can't fucking play, you can't fucking get out the old iPhone and play cut the rope.

04:29.520 --> 04:33.440
You can yell that because someone's like, turn off your iPhone. You're disturbing everybody else

04:33.440 --> 04:39.120
who's trying to beat it. Why are the police devoting resources to make this a safe space

04:39.120 --> 04:45.360
for people to watch pornography and do nothing? How dare you? I'm watching genitals be exposed

04:45.360 --> 04:50.000
I'm watching genitals be exposed on the screen, sir, not in my face.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.440
That's way creepier to me that someone will just sit and appreciate the jugs.

04:56.560 --> 05:00.000
I love watching this girl get rammed and I'm going to do nothing about it.

05:00.560 --> 05:06.720
It's a bodily function. It would be tantamount to someone going into the urinal, putting his

05:06.720 --> 05:11.760
hands up on the wall, and just standing there. Just standing there and staring at it and not

05:11.760 --> 05:17.120
doing anything. I'd call the cops on that guy. I think people should be arrested for not

05:17.120 --> 05:22.640
masturbating in an adult theater. Thank you. Yes. Cause what are they doing? It's like being at

05:22.640 --> 05:26.560
McDonald's. There's a guy over there taking notes and talking into a tiny tape recorder.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.040
Could you please eject him from the theater? There's a real weirdo in there.

05:31.600 --> 05:37.280
Note to self. Vaginas seem to like it when you do this stuff to them.

05:37.280 --> 05:45.280
Can I seriously, all kidding aside, we all have bigger fucking fish to fry than Fred Willard.

05:45.280 --> 05:50.480
Can we please let this man live out his days without this embarrassing ass shit on his record?

05:51.200 --> 05:55.600
Another important thing, the thing that I keep coming back to is who the fuck was he hurting?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.960
He's a genius and he's done some amazing work.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.400
I think we were all just a little disappointed because we expect this kind of behavior from you,

06:06.400 --> 06:12.320
Gene Levy. Fred Willard, Fred Willard, I don't know. I guess he seems a little bit more wholesome

06:12.320 --> 06:16.640
than Eugene Levy in my mind. Somebody tells me this happens to Eugene Levy. My first reaction

06:16.640 --> 06:24.480
is, again? Yeah. Yeah. Is it Thursday already? Because Eugene Levy always masturbates on

06:24.480 --> 06:27.680
Thursdays. Is that what you're saying? Why do you know this? Why do you know this about him?

06:27.680 --> 06:34.560
Do you not read his blog? I don't. He's like a Batman villain. The most ineffectual

06:34.560 --> 06:40.640
crime spree in the world. Leave Fred Willard alone. This is an advice show. My advice,

06:40.640 --> 06:47.840
leave Fred Willard alone. But we've got a lot of other people to advise. Let's hop right in.

06:49.280 --> 06:54.000
My wife and I are leaving town for a week and a half and some friends of ours have agreed to come

06:54.000 --> 06:59.200
and stay in our house to keep an eye on our puppy and whatnot. Should we have them sleep on our bed

06:59.200 --> 07:04.640
or on our guest room futon? Our bedroom is the only room with an air conditioner, but we weren't

07:04.640 --> 07:13.360
sure if that would be weird. That's from Troubled in Toronto. You can tell them, you can tell them

07:13.360 --> 07:17.520
to sleep wherever you want to. If your bed's the most comfortable room in the house, that's where

07:17.520 --> 07:21.520
they're going. Yeah. You'll never know. I mean, it's not like they're afraid of you checking in.

07:22.080 --> 07:27.920
Yeah. They're gonna go wherever's most comfortable. Yeah, human beings are basically like, like

07:27.920 --> 07:35.040
cockroaches. Exactly. Yeah, they're gonna go where the warmth and the comfort is. Just let them sleep

07:35.040 --> 07:40.240
on your bed. The fear here is that they're gonna, they're just gonna get it on in your bed. And

07:40.240 --> 07:45.040
this is the kind of fear that is destroying Fred Willard right now. People are gonna fuck. It's

07:45.040 --> 07:52.000
part of life. You came from fuck. You came from fucking. Just calm down. From fuck you came to

07:52.000 --> 07:59.040
fuck. You shall return. Exactly. If you're lucky. I think they're worried about it being weird for

07:59.040 --> 08:04.640
the other person too. This is pretty easy. You change the sheets and you say, hey, we put fresh

08:04.640 --> 08:12.080
sheets on the bed. They don't have any of our sex on them. So if you could do the same when you leave,

08:12.080 --> 08:18.480
just leave the sheets on a sex file. But that is giving them permission to just like, just do have

08:18.480 --> 08:25.680
sex. And then when you're, when the act comes to perfect blissful fruition, just, just, just

08:25.680 --> 08:34.240
everywhere. Just go buck fucking wild. Just really express yourself. I like fucking Jackson Pollock

08:34.240 --> 08:39.840
this sheet up. Go for it. And then hang it on the wall for your friends to see you and then return.

08:39.840 --> 08:45.040
Yeah. Signed in the bottom corner. Hey, troubled in Toronto. Why do you have so many homeless

08:45.040 --> 08:50.480
friends? Why do you know two homeless people that'll come to your home and just camp out?

08:50.480 --> 08:55.120
What's up with these squatters that you're friends with? I've known people before that have like

08:55.120 --> 09:01.280
house set and like it involves spending the night at the house, even though they only live like four

09:01.280 --> 09:07.520
miles away from the house. Yeah. Like go make sure everything's cool. Then go home, sleep,

09:07.520 --> 09:12.400
come back in the morning. Yeah. Or else you need to get a, you need to get a chain going where

09:12.400 --> 09:16.480
somebody has to come house hit for you. Exactly. It seems like it creates a lot of vacancies.

09:18.080 --> 09:24.640
This is after watching, um, doomsday preppers enough. I, I, this is not an issue for me. I'm

09:24.640 --> 09:29.520
at any moment ready to just walk around my house, flip a switch and just shut it down.

09:30.160 --> 09:35.520
Yeah. Completely secure from the outside world. Shut it down. With that plan,

09:35.520 --> 09:39.760
do you have like the three things you would grab and get out? No, I have a bug out bag.

09:39.760 --> 09:45.680
Do you just keep your cat in there or what? Is this, is this a, is this a real show?

09:46.880 --> 09:52.400
Okay. Yes, it is. Okay. You should listen to the hit TV podcast satellite dish with Justin Sidney.

09:52.400 --> 09:56.720
We talk about it, but anyway, uh, yeah, it's a real show. People have these, uh,

09:57.360 --> 10:03.520
they're ready for the black Swan event. That's going to, uh, upset the balance. Is that,

10:03.520 --> 10:08.080
is the black Swan ready for black Swan on blue Ray? Is that the rogue planet one?

10:08.080 --> 10:14.720
Is that where a rogue planet black Swan is basically any like, Oh, like slow mo

10:15.600 --> 10:21.520
bad news bears sweeping across the, the, uh, the planet. Yeah. But like if they made a sequel to

10:21.520 --> 10:27.760
the remake of bad news bears, that would be a black and you know, Brendan Fraser's the coach,

10:27.760 --> 10:31.600
you know, he is, I just got to chill. I just got to actual chill.

10:31.600 --> 10:37.040
I can't tell if that was fear or because it was fucking movie magic. A little bit of both,

10:37.040 --> 10:41.440
a little bit of both green light. It was safe. Green light. It, this might be the end of the

10:41.440 --> 10:45.520
world is like when it was like when the super collider first got going, people are like,

10:45.520 --> 10:50.320
what's it going to do? Change science forever or obliterate everything or make Brendan Fraser

10:50.320 --> 10:57.840
have a third comeback. Uh-huh. How many changes to God particle, buddy? Can we take, can we take

10:57.840 --> 11:03.600
one of Brendan Fraser's fucking career nine lives and just give one to Fred Willard?

11:05.840 --> 11:11.440
Can we float him a, a career second chance from, from old phrase? Cause I think he's had enough.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.600
You're right. Brendan Fraser gets more second chances than he's on his like six or seven

11:19.600 --> 11:25.120
chance. The dude makes monkey bone and someone in Hollywood goes, Oh, he can do better. Come on.

11:25.120 --> 11:33.600
Come on. Just think of his other work. Like Georgia, the no Adam and he, no journey to no

11:33.600 --> 11:40.240
mommy eight. No, wait, wait. God's and monsters. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Serene McKellen. That was

11:40.240 --> 11:45.520
really good. Let's get another shot at an Encino man. He's a pretty good in the one episode of

11:45.520 --> 11:53.680
scrubs. It's ever on TV where he's the brother with leukemia. Yeah. Spoilers. Sorry. Sorry.

11:53.680 --> 12:01.840
Sorry. 2003. I ruined your episode of scrubs. Is our next episode going to open up with us

12:02.720 --> 12:08.400
starting the Brendan Fraser defense fund? What is Brendan Fraser doing now? That's my

12:08.400 --> 12:14.640
mastermating in Fred Willard's home. Yeah. I had to go to the point of theater. Brendan Fraser

12:14.640 --> 12:24.720
was in my jerk room. Three things that go bad after three days, house guests, fish,

12:24.720 --> 12:35.760
and Brendan Fraser's come back. That's the name of my cover band. No, it's not blast from the past.

12:35.760 --> 12:44.800
Keep it. No, thanks. Oh, put your monkey boat away, Brenda. I'm kind of cause of flooring theater.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.400
I'm out of Brendan Fraser movies. You know what I find funny? Just real quick. Brendan Fraser,

12:48.400 --> 12:58.320
uh, thing. Wrap up your mommy. Uh, here's a, this Yahoo answer was sent in by, uh,

12:58.320 --> 13:06.960
Dirk in it. Thanks. Dirk in it. It's by Yahoo answers user. Uh, Oh joy. Who asks if I go away

13:06.960 --> 13:14.160
for two weeks, will my horses forget me? Okay. So I've had my horse for over two years and we built

13:14.160 --> 13:18.400
a really strong bond and next week I'm going away for a week, coming back for a couple of days,

13:18.400 --> 13:23.040
then going away for another week. And in that time, my friend is going to exercise him. Also,

13:23.040 --> 13:27.920
I have a four year old who I've got a pretty strong bond with who she'll be exercising

13:27.920 --> 13:31.760
for the first week. I fucking hope they're talking about a four year old horse and not

13:31.760 --> 13:36.800
a four year old person. I'm worried that they'll forget me and that they'll prefer my friend to me.

13:36.800 --> 13:41.200
I just need some reassurance. Cause sometimes I feel they are the only ones who genuinely like me

13:41.200 --> 13:47.680
and I couldn't bear to be chosen over. I'll be seeing the first horse for the couple of days.

13:47.680 --> 13:53.680
I'm home BTW. Thank you. X, X, X. Everything takes a real sad turn right there at the end.

13:53.680 --> 14:00.160
Well, well, or right there at the beginning or all throughout. It's pervasive, the sadness.

14:00.720 --> 14:06.640
Horses can't tell one person from another. Is that sh- listen, listen. This is fact. No, no,

14:06.640 --> 14:14.160
this is 100% fact. To horses, humans are just lumpy skeletons that bring them carrots.

14:14.160 --> 14:20.080
They have no idea where one human ends and another begins. I think they can recognize size,

14:20.080 --> 14:23.520
uh, the size and girth of a human. I think they can size them up like that.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.440
Oh yeah, definitely. They gotta tell the difference between like a jockey and a big fat fatty.

14:27.440 --> 14:32.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause, um, yeah, exactly. Um,

14:33.920 --> 14:37.200
And they gotta be able to tell when somebody like bends over to pick something up and they're ready

14:37.200 --> 14:41.840
to comically be kicked in the bottom and like flung across the room or in the head. Cause

14:41.840 --> 14:47.680
horses are awful. Um, I think all animals are out to kill us all the time. That's just like my

14:47.680 --> 14:52.000
opinion. It's not, it's probably not any science behind it, but I think everyone,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.600
if you really dig deep into your heart and just like really inception those,

14:55.600 --> 15:02.240
those sweet pet memories, you'll know it's the truth. Um, I is, but I, the more I read

15:02.240 --> 15:08.800
these fucking horse yahoos, the more I think maybe, maybe horses are on some next level shit.

15:09.440 --> 15:15.280
You think that they're the one animal where they're like, they're starting to approach

15:15.280 --> 15:20.080
some sort of relationship. Well, let me throw this out. Have you ever been nodded at by a horse?

15:20.720 --> 15:26.400
Yeah. It's a beautiful moment when you nod back and you're like, yeah, I know. What's up horse?

15:27.120 --> 15:31.200
Um, I guess, I mean, there's some, there's gotta be some biology to it, right? Like you're,

15:32.240 --> 15:38.320
the horse is the only animal that you have to put your genitals on. That's true. That's the only

15:38.320 --> 15:43.360
one you're forced to. Yeah. Right. There are so many things like just think about the connections

15:43.360 --> 15:50.880
like horses have teeth. Humans have teeth. That's interesting. Hmm. What are you hiding? You know,

15:50.880 --> 15:58.480
like how about an uncle Sam? I think you got to put your, your junk on the horse to interface with

15:58.480 --> 16:04.720
it. Um, that's how you control it by flexing your junk. Yeah, exactly. There's a horse will respond

16:04.720 --> 16:11.040
to the slightest shift in junk. Didn't you see avatar? Like that's how that's how it works. When

16:11.040 --> 16:16.560
you're up on it, there's like, there's fear, there's danger, but there's also trust. You know

16:16.560 --> 16:22.400
what I mean? There's kegels and there's trust and fear and danger and all that blends around. All

16:22.400 --> 16:29.360
of that mixes up and I like it. It's straight up Equus. Yeah, right. Chinkle, chinkle, chinkle,

16:29.360 --> 16:34.160
guys. I think this is, I think, I think horses might be on some next level shit. They're like

16:34.160 --> 16:38.800
the dolphins of the land. They're like land dolphins. They're basically land dolphins.

16:38.800 --> 16:44.960
Hey, do you want to go down to land dolphin races and lay some bets? Me neither. That seems inhumane.

16:44.960 --> 16:50.480
Let's just let them run free. Why don't we have dolphin races? Just side note. Yes, dolphin races

16:50.480 --> 16:54.960
would be fresh. I'd really rather watch that than horse races. I think it's because creating on-sea

16:54.960 --> 17:00.480
seeding is so, is so daunting because everyone who would want to watch dolphins races is fat.

17:01.040 --> 17:05.600
So you would, I don't know how you would buoy them. When you call it, you would need like mermaid

17:05.600 --> 17:10.720
jockeys probably. See, yeah, if I said dolphin jockey, that kind of sounds like a racist slur,

17:10.720 --> 17:17.600
maybe. Yeah. Or like something you call a scuba diver if you don't like know what that is. Very

17:17.600 --> 17:24.560
good. Maybe someone, some sort of islander. I don't know. Is it, maybe it's like a, maybe it's

17:24.560 --> 17:30.480
like a Tongan racial slur. I don't know. I do not know that that, I don't think it's. It's like

17:30.480 --> 17:35.840
somebody who's not from the island. You mean like they put their pineapple on top of their, on top

17:35.840 --> 17:40.720
of their beef, you know, like, Oh, you don't put the beef on the pineapple. You dolphin jockey.

17:40.720 --> 17:48.240
Yeah. Go back to the mainland. Is that your islander impression Justin? Yeah. You just say

17:48.240 --> 17:58.080
everything slow. Go back to the mainland dolphin jockey. You sound like you've lost the ability

17:58.080 --> 18:04.720
to have inflection. Yeah. If like, if the Caribbean had like a deep south and also you were drunk.

18:04.720 --> 18:15.680
Take your banana republic polo and your ability to modulate your voice tone back to the mainland

18:16.400 --> 18:25.200
dolphin jockey. Now it's becoming like a Charlton Heston islander. It's why he played it. It was

18:25.200 --> 18:30.720
the sixties. It was a crazy time. They got Charlton Heston. It was like Genghis Khan and John Wayne,

18:30.720 --> 18:36.800
you know, they, they, they got a white man to play an ethnic role. It was highly, highly offensive.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.480
Do you guys think that the bigger an animal is, the more your human capacity to love it is expanded?

18:46.080 --> 18:51.200
To an extent. Yeah. I don't love elephants all that much. See, I don't love, I'm always

18:51.200 --> 18:55.280
taking a T-Rex. I mean like that, that, that scares me. Well, those don't, those don't, and never

18:55.280 --> 19:04.480
existed. If you, I like, you guys remember, do you guys remember operation Dumbo drop? What was

19:04.480 --> 19:10.560
the one with Bill Murray? It was operation Dumbo drop. Was it? Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember how much

19:10.560 --> 19:16.560
he fucking loved that elephant? Sure. Not by, at the beginning of course, that elephant was a huge

19:16.560 --> 19:23.440
hindrance to him and his, his way of life. When he was trying to crash on, crash parties and like

19:23.440 --> 19:29.200
sleep on people's couches across the country and just like hang out. Uh-huh. You know he's coming

19:29.200 --> 19:34.880
to Austin, right? Oh, I'm, I'm gonna fucking hunt that down. Dumbo? Yeah. No, no, Bill Murray. No,

19:34.880 --> 19:40.000
that elephant's dead as fuck. Elephants have a lifespan of like three years. Yeah, it's weird.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.760
They're like lightning bugs. Um, I'm saying maybe that's what's up with horses is that like I could

19:45.760 --> 19:51.200
never love my cat as much as I could love a horse because they're, they're so much bigger that they're,

19:51.200 --> 19:55.120
they're, I don't know, they're more of a friend. But that has limits, right? Like, okay, so you've

19:55.120 --> 20:01.680
got free Willy. I can concede that point, but when you get up to like the blue whale level, I think

20:01.680 --> 20:09.520
it becomes harder to sort of. You're saying there's a bell curve for animal size and love. The perfect

20:09.520 --> 20:15.120
size at which you can love an animal is a horse. Yeah. As it becomes bigger than a horse or smaller

20:15.120 --> 20:21.360
than a horse, you love it less. Does that horse is like the most you can love something? I think so.

20:21.360 --> 20:33.600
Yeah. Yes. Including other people. Yes. Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. And also, by the way, before we go

20:33.600 --> 20:38.480
any further, a horse is the most you can love something. It's a bumper sticker trademark of

20:38.480 --> 20:46.480
my brother, my brother and me. So for, for you, uh, you, you amateur, uh, horse riders, uh, don't,

20:46.480 --> 20:52.960
don't, uh, don't steal that from us. Also, we, we've taken, uh, my other car is a horse. I'd rather be

20:52.960 --> 20:59.600
horsing, and, uh, my horse is smarter than your honor roll student. Uh, that's good. We also have the

20:59.600 --> 21:07.280
rights to just horsing around. That's J-E-S apostrophe and J-U-S apostrophe. Just horse around. We do not

21:07.280 --> 21:15.920
own the rights to J-U-S-T horsing around. That is, of course, owned by horses. Those damn

21:15.920 --> 21:22.400
entrepreneurial horses. Horses. Um, I don't travel all that often, but I found it odd that the last

21:22.400 --> 21:28.080
hotel I stayed in, there was a spot on the bill for tipping the maids who clean the room. Is this

21:28.080 --> 21:34.880
a thing? Do people do this? I've never left a tip at a hotel in my life. Am I good? That's from

21:34.880 --> 21:39.760
confused, confused cheapskate in California. You're probably not good. No. You're not good.

21:39.760 --> 21:44.000
You probably tipped wrong. No matter how much you put down, you either put too much or not enough,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.040
or you didn't do it at all, or you weren't supposed to do it and you look stupid.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.560
Tipping is- That's how I feel. Every time- Yeah. The last time I went and got, like, an expensive

21:52.560 --> 21:58.560
haircut because, damn it, I'm worth it, I- there was a line for, like, tipping, and I had this moment

21:58.560 --> 22:02.400
where I looked at the lady. Oh, you definitely, definitely, you definitely tip a haircut. Yeah,

22:02.400 --> 22:06.160
but I didn't know how much was appropriate. Twenty percent. It was a very nice place.

22:06.160 --> 22:10.480
Tipping's a trap. Tipping is a trap to make you feel stupid. We've talked, we've talked about

22:10.480 --> 22:14.480
tipping a lot, so I don't want to, I don't want to belabor this question too much, but

22:16.720 --> 22:20.400
if you're just, if you're going to do anything ever, Google it and find out if you're supposed

22:20.400 --> 22:25.040
to tip or not. Yeah. I would just leave, leave some expensive jewelry out on the counter in

22:25.040 --> 22:29.280
your room so the maids know that that's their tip, and they can just, like, take it when they clean.

22:29.280 --> 22:35.120
Hey, who's such a gay boy here? He must want me to take it. I, I, uh, I actually had a situation

22:35.120 --> 22:41.440
that came in handy real, uh, last weekend. I was in, uh, Dayton with some friends, and

22:42.160 --> 22:46.720
we did bad things to a hotel room. We kind of messed it up, and I kind of spilled some wine on

22:46.720 --> 22:53.600
the sheets, and it got a little hairy in there, and so I handed the maid a generous tip as she

22:53.600 --> 22:58.640
went into the room. You fucking paid her off to forget you were there. So I paid her off to keep

22:58.640 --> 23:05.040
a secret. Now let me revise that story with the truth. Uh, Sydney gave the maid a generous tip,

23:05.040 --> 23:09.600
and I, no bullshit, saw the maid was coming down the hallway and turned around and hid in the

23:09.600 --> 23:13.600
elevator because I was so embarrassed of the room's condition. Now, can I ask what you,

23:13.600 --> 23:18.560
you're not the fucking... She was going down, then the maid went in the room, she saw the room,

23:18.560 --> 23:22.800
she made some snide comments that I heard from down the hall, and then the maid went to go get

23:22.800 --> 23:27.360
a pillow and bring it back to the room, and I, unwilling to hide in the hallway anymore, went

23:27.360 --> 23:32.960
into our room and hid under the table, uh, hoping that she would not see me and connect me with

23:32.960 --> 23:37.520
those other people that messed up that hotel room so bad. He's actually recording from under said

23:37.520 --> 23:45.600
table right now. I am still under the table. You are not the fucking wild stallion type. I have to

23:45.600 --> 23:53.120
know what you did to this room. There was just so many bottles! I'm boring, but like, I know cool

23:53.120 --> 23:58.800
people. So, like, there was a lot of drinking, a lot of carousing. Like I said, I spilled...

23:58.800 --> 24:01.840
You can't just say carousing! What is that? Are you guys having a fucking...? I bought a bottle

24:01.840 --> 24:07.040
of something called Raise the Glass to the Bacchanalian Gods. Yeah, like, I bought a...

24:07.040 --> 24:10.640
This is the kind of night it was. I bought, before we went, I bought a bottle of something called

24:10.640 --> 24:17.040
Adult Chocolate Milk. Like, that was literally what it was called, and we drank that, and we

24:17.040 --> 24:21.440
played some music and danced, you know, like young people do. Like, this is what young people do.

24:21.440 --> 24:28.960
You fell asleep by 1115. It was four, but yes, basically. I tried to fall asleep, and every...

24:28.960 --> 24:33.280
The blow would keep me awake. There was no blow. I wish... I don't know how to avoid it by that.

24:33.280 --> 24:39.200
I just assume you met people punching you in the face. No. But yeah, like, I paid her off, so

24:39.200 --> 24:44.480
if you feel bad about what you did in your hotel room, tips are really good, because it's like,

24:44.480 --> 24:51.200
hey, sorry. I think... The same thing applies if you house it for a friend and you bone in their

24:51.200 --> 24:56.800
bed. Hand them a 20 on your way out the door for dry cleaning. I don't know that this is dependent

24:56.800 --> 25:02.560
on how much your room costs, but I kind of feel like, I don't know, like a five dollar tip per

25:02.560 --> 25:08.880
night is like, is good. That seems fair to me, right? I mean, I don't know actually how you

25:08.880 --> 25:14.720
figure it out. I don't know what the recommended is. I am going into the fucking lion's mouth

25:14.720 --> 25:23.360
of this issue next month, because my girlfriend and I are staying at a fancy all-inclusive resort

25:23.360 --> 25:28.960
in Playa del Carmen, so it's all-inclusive. Everything's paid for, so I'm not going to have

25:28.960 --> 25:34.800
that 20 percent rule to guide me on tips, because you've got to still tip people. You know what I

25:34.800 --> 25:39.760
mean? Yeah, you just need like a pocket full of bills, and then stop handing them to them.

25:39.760 --> 25:45.760
Literally. Take their hand away. Except I'm gonna be chilling in the pool all the time,

25:45.760 --> 25:49.840
and on the beach, so I can't have like a pocket full of bills. I gotta have like a waterproof

25:49.840 --> 25:56.240
fanny pack, and that's not a good luck. Right. You know, if you find yourself having questions

25:56.240 --> 26:03.600
about this, I recommend the How Stuff Works episode, Stuff You Should Know How Tipping Works.

26:04.400 --> 26:09.280
Boom. Yeah. Helped. Consider yourself helped. I mean, I know how it fucking works. I take money

26:09.280 --> 26:13.200
out of my pocket that's more additional. He wasn't talking to you, dullard. Yeah, Griffin,

26:13.200 --> 26:16.960
and I'm also not talking about the process of removing bills from a wallet. That's what I'm

26:16.960 --> 26:20.560
saying. You take the money out, and you give it to the man, even though you already gave him

26:20.560 --> 26:23.920
money before. It's so fucking... You have the monies, and then you give away monies, and then

26:23.920 --> 26:26.960
you don't have the monies no more. It's not my fault that they pay you like a joke. Work to

26:26.960 --> 26:33.040
earn more monies. Right. You should demand better wages. I will help you unionize, but this five-ski

26:33.040 --> 26:38.640
is mine. What kills me... Well, we've talked about tipping enough, but what kills me is coffee shops

26:38.640 --> 26:41.520
where I have no idea how much they're actually getting paid, and I think I'm always getting

26:41.520 --> 26:45.440
ripped off. I think it's a dupe. I just like to get my money away. I think it's a worldwide dupe.

26:45.440 --> 26:49.280
I think everyone who works at... I mean, I can't even go on with this bit. I have friends who work

26:49.280 --> 26:53.840
in restaurants that are gonna burn my fucking house down. Hey, I just checked. It's one to two

26:53.840 --> 27:00.480
dollars for a bad hotel, three to five dollars for a good one. But don't wait until the last night,

27:00.480 --> 27:05.920
because different people will clean your room. So leave a couple bucks or a few bucks out,

27:05.920 --> 27:10.720
and leave it somewhere prominent so they'll be sure to know it's not just stealing.

27:11.600 --> 27:16.160
Like, tape it right next to the wine stains you left all over the bed and wherever you spilled

27:16.160 --> 27:20.560
your adult chocolate milk. Put a dollar by every adult chocolate milk stain like you're fucking

27:20.560 --> 27:36.560
cataloging a crime scene. Speaking of money, money time. Okay.

27:42.400 --> 27:50.000
Friends, every Friday at 10 pm on the IFC, you are going to tune in for Comedy Bang Bang. It's

27:50.000 --> 27:54.800
this absurd half-hour comedy show. It only looks like a talk show. It's got Scott Ackerman. I know

27:54.800 --> 28:00.240
you're wondering, is the Ack there? He is. Reggie Watts? You betcha. They got great guests like Amy

28:00.240 --> 28:07.360
Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, and Seth Rogen. This Friday, they got Elizabeth Banks, and one of the

28:07.360 --> 28:14.720
special guests this week is Polly Shore. So maybe they can find out what the phrase is up to from

28:14.720 --> 28:20.400
Polly. It's comedy so nice they banged it twice this Friday and every Friday at 10 pm on IFC

28:20.400 --> 28:26.320
Comedy Bang Bang. I want to talk about Squarespace. It's a website where you can create your own

28:26.320 --> 28:31.920

28:55.280 --> 29:01.040
MySpaceBrother space and then the number seven. Go check it out. Building websites is difficult,

29:01.040 --> 29:11.920
but Squarespace can lead you through the desert to the sweet oasis of website success. That was a

29:11.920 --> 29:18.720
beautiful analogy. I was about to goof on that, but it's really evocative. I can see it in my

29:18.720 --> 29:26.960
mind's eye, you know? Yeah, that's me. I paint pictures with my words that hang in the air.

29:26.960 --> 29:34.640
Oh, fuck. I can taste it there. Yeah. I can taste the pictures that you said with words.

29:36.640 --> 29:42.800
I'm on Salvia. It should be noted. We should do an all Salvia episode. It would last four minutes

29:42.800 --> 29:47.520
and it would be fucking bananas. It'd just be full of screaming. Don't suggest that to people

29:47.520 --> 29:52.000
because then that'll be all we hear about. Oh, we got that Salvia app. Never. Never. I'm

29:52.000 --> 29:57.840
never doing that. We'll do our Salvia app and our D&D app on the same day. It'll be great.

29:58.560 --> 30:04.240
Special bonus, subscribers only. Kickstart that. Kickstart our Dungeons and Dragons Salvia app.

30:04.960 --> 30:11.440
Everybody, guys. Everybody. Someday we will look back on this time in American history and think,

30:12.080 --> 30:17.680
God, I wish I kickstarted something. Yeah. Man, I wish I got on that gravy train. I keep thinking

30:17.680 --> 30:26.000
like what we should do is kickstart a UK tour for my brother and my brother and me and it's like,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.680
who would pay for that? Well, people who come to it. Okay. But I think that at this point in

30:29.680 --> 30:34.560
history, people will pay for anything. Yeah. They just like the idea of us doing it so they'll pay

30:34.560 --> 30:40.160
for it. I think a UK tour would even demand too much work from our end. I think that we could

30:40.160 --> 30:49.920
shoot a lot lower and have our ROI, you know, really, really synergize our ROI. I completely

30:49.920 --> 30:54.080
understood that. Yeah, portfolios. How would you synergize the return on investment for this? Oh,

30:54.080 --> 31:00.560
you know, gross national product. Oh, okay. What you have to do is you have to minimize your loss

31:00.560 --> 31:09.360
risk while increasing your stocks, your stocks. Now, would you diversify that, Griffin? No, no,

31:09.360 --> 31:14.240
no. That's it. That buzzword was only applicable in the nineties. You got to synergize it. Don't

31:14.240 --> 31:21.200
diversify. You want one big good thing. Do you emulsify it? You emulsify it in a tray of butter

31:21.840 --> 31:28.400
for about 25 to 30 minutes. Don't over emulsify. I cannot wait until my equity matures.

31:29.600 --> 31:37.120
I can't wait till we mature. Hey, razor choices, electric or manual from Gmail. I love it. Short,

31:37.120 --> 31:43.760
it's sweet. Short, sweet, to the point. And I am a big believer in the wet shave with a safety

31:43.760 --> 31:51.600
razor. That's what our pod father, Jesse Thorn, suggested on the grooming episode of Put This On.

31:52.400 --> 31:58.720
And it's a method that I have come to really, really enjoy. Is a safety razor like safety

31:58.720 --> 32:03.120
scissors? No. Yeah, it's like a safety pop. It's one of those lollipops with the hoop on it so

32:03.120 --> 32:10.160
the dumb kids can't swallow it. It's a funny name actually because it's like safety compared to

32:10.720 --> 32:16.240
a straight razor, but compared to like all other razors, it's wicked dangerous. It is safe

32:16.240 --> 32:20.240
compared to shaving with a fucking Claymore, to shaving with a broadsword.

32:22.320 --> 32:27.520
But I've never experienced any bad cuts. And it turns shaving into a bit more a ritual. I mean,

32:27.520 --> 32:36.320
you got to get a brush and you got to lather up and you've got to make it all nice and smooth

32:36.320 --> 32:41.920
on your face. You usually do a couple of passes, but it's worth it. It's easier on my skin. As a

32:41.920 --> 32:48.240
bearded gentleman, I go with the electric because it's better for trimming. Sure. And then also,

32:48.240 --> 32:53.120
I have a very sensitive neck and the manual just gives me the razor burn. The electric,

32:53.120 --> 32:57.600
no problem. Travis, the electric eats your face. Your neck is looking a little fat lately.

32:58.480 --> 33:03.360
How dare you? I'm just saying. I've been doing neck kegels. Okay.

33:06.080 --> 33:14.800
My neck is as tight as an 18 year old's. Oh God. Do you know what I do? What? I do electric

33:14.800 --> 33:23.440
on the weekdays and I go straight razor on the weekends. I like that. I like that. It keeps it

33:23.440 --> 33:27.840
from being too much of a chore, too much of a routine. The problem, I used to be all straight

33:27.840 --> 33:32.720
razor because Justin got me that for my birthday, I think. And I really like it, but the problem is

33:32.720 --> 33:37.920
that it takes a while. It takes like three times as long. It's just like dragging a Mach 3 across

33:37.920 --> 33:45.520
your stupid face. Wait, just so I'm clear, when you say electric, do you mean like a vibrating

33:46.240 --> 33:50.400
Mach 3? I mean a vibrator. I just rub like a vibrator that I got from Extreme Restraints

33:50.400 --> 33:56.080
across my face until the hair- You're not talking about those crazy spinning circular

33:56.080 --> 34:01.120
blades, right? We can all agree that's crazy. No, that's- No, I've got like a beard trimmer set.

34:01.120 --> 34:09.840
Yeah. I shouldn't have to say this. You shouldn't put some sort of alien thresher on your grill,

34:09.840 --> 34:17.840
you dumbo. Don't put that there ever. Shave it. What the fuck do those vibrating razors accomplish,

34:17.840 --> 34:22.800
by the way? When your skin goes like, oh, that's nice. I'm going to stick the hair out farther.

34:22.800 --> 34:30.720
Yeah. It arouses the hairs. Yeah. It gives your hair a boner. Yeah. I was just ready for like

34:30.720 --> 34:36.080
everybody in the world to simultaneously realize that that was bullshit. No, Doug, I swear to God,

34:36.080 --> 34:42.800
it's all I can use. I swear to God, you can't go back on that. It gets your shit so smooth.

34:42.800 --> 34:48.960
What are you talking about, Griff? That vibrating Mach 4 or 5. Oh, that is so good. I mean,

34:48.960 --> 34:55.760
when I was using, back in the day, when I was still using those kind of multi-edge razors,

34:55.760 --> 35:03.600
the vibrating Mach 3 is a fine choice. It's a treat. It's a real treat. I like the beard trimmer

35:03.600 --> 35:08.720
because the electric, I can set it at a line and just use such a clean line all the way across.

35:08.720 --> 35:13.360
Yeah. And use it at the same time to keep my beard manageable and not looking like a wizard.

35:14.480 --> 35:21.600
First off, you should really chase that look. I do it my way because it's fast on the weekdays

35:21.600 --> 35:28.400
when it's working time. And then on the weekends, I can luxuriate. I'll take a nice, long, hot shower

35:28.400 --> 35:38.720
and then luxuriate with a 15-minute wet shave. It's like a sharp massage. It's real good.

35:38.720 --> 35:46.000
The only other problem with wet shaving is when you're traveling. Yeah, there's a lot of accoutrement.

35:46.640 --> 35:51.440
Well, the accoutrement is not as much the problem as the fact that you can't bring razors.

35:51.440 --> 35:57.120
If you're doing carry-on, you can't bring a safety razor with you. There's no context in which they

35:57.120 --> 36:03.200
are cool with it. I've gotten it through once or twice just leaving it in the razor, but they are

36:03.200 --> 36:09.840
very... Because it is like a... I mean, it is a... It's dangerous, yeah. It's a short knife. I really

36:09.840 --> 36:19.120
want to bring back the Sweeney Todd style straight razor. Can I do that? I'm sure there's a hipster

36:19.120 --> 36:26.160
hipster doing it somewhere. No, I want to do it unironically. Too late. Everything is ironic. It's

36:26.160 --> 36:33.920
2012. Fuck. Griffin, hit me. Here's a Yahoo. This Yahoo was sent in by Brett Townsend. Thank you,

36:33.920 --> 36:39.280
Brett. It's by Yahoo Insta user Tori Bailey who asks, how can I ask my gynecologist out?

36:40.720 --> 36:44.560
Actually, he is not my gyno. My doctor transferred me there because of my enlarged ovary.

36:44.560 --> 36:47.840
We are trying to find out what is wrong with my bladder and he keeps sending me back. I had a

36:47.840 --> 36:54.320
pelvic exam once and I kind of liked it, but before that, we was talking and laughing. I noticed we

36:54.320 --> 36:58.960
both looked back at each other when it was over. He was kind of checking me out. I was scared to

36:58.960 --> 37:02.480
look back because I didn't want him to think I liked him then. I attracted to him a lot and he's

37:02.480 --> 37:05.760
so cute. I just went today and he wanted to do an exam again, but my little sister was with me,

37:05.760 --> 37:11.920
so he rescheduled it. IDK. Yeah, he was checking you out. Literally. When he did the exam, I was

37:11.920 --> 37:18.240
nervous because I was laughing when he was inside me. It kind of tickled. Is this Fifty Shades of

37:18.240 --> 37:23.760
Grey? This is what Fifty Shades of Grey is about. I can't go on with this question. I can't either.

37:24.720 --> 37:32.480
How do you, I'm sorry ladies, but how do you maintain the mystique in a dating relationship

37:32.480 --> 37:40.240
when the guy has already gotten to eighth base? Not only that, but in the most clinically detached

37:40.240 --> 37:49.440
way. He has cartographed your vagina to an extent that he is bored with it forever. Right. He

37:49.440 --> 37:57.200
literally knows you better than you know yourself. He has drawn a depth map of every molecule of your

37:57.200 --> 38:06.640
bathing suit area. He has carved his initials into your cervix. He could find your uterus with his

38:06.640 --> 38:14.000
eyes closed. I don't think it will. What is the practical effort? God, where's that uterus?

38:15.520 --> 38:22.080
Oh no, the power's out. Yeah. It's the black swan. I need a place to hide. Let me get up in

38:22.080 --> 38:30.960
that enlarged uterus. Oh man. Yeah, I could see this. I could see this being an issue.

38:30.960 --> 38:40.880
That's like me saying I'd like to ask out the poor young doctor who had to give me,

38:40.880 --> 38:46.480
you know, stick his finger up my butt. Oh man. That poor guy. But see if the roles,

38:46.480 --> 38:50.960
I feel like if the roles were reversed. No one has to get prostate exams anymore. Sydney just

38:50.960 --> 38:55.680
told me that's the new thing. That's not true. No more prostate exams. It's fine. You don't need

38:55.680 --> 39:00.480
to get them. Now it's a lot more anecdotal. It's like, so how's your prostate? And you say,

39:00.480 --> 39:06.160
it's good. It's good. It seems good. It feels fine. I don't actually know that was true.

39:06.160 --> 39:09.120
That I was sort of half listening. It can't be true. Go get your prostate

39:09.120 --> 39:15.360
checks right now. Even if you're 15. I think, I think if the roles were reversed. Make sure it's

39:15.360 --> 39:21.360
a doctor. This is a female doctor, a female penis doctor. I feel like there wasn't any mystery there

39:21.360 --> 39:27.760
to begin with. Everyone knows how that works. The vagina is like inside you and it's like a maze.

39:27.760 --> 39:33.440
It's like a hedge maze with a minotaur in the middle of it. And the minotaur is pleasure.

39:33.440 --> 39:37.280
You took a hard left there. The anger. Fred Willard is listening to this podcast right

39:37.280 --> 39:44.720
now. Just jerking off his wiener. Hopefully for the privacy of his own Starbucks on the corner.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.640
I don't think there's any way you can have that conversation with somebody. I do not think,

39:50.640 --> 39:55.680
I think when you have a person inside you, you can't clinically. When a person is in you

39:55.680 --> 40:02.000
clinically, there's no way to flirt. Wait, how about this? Hey, time out.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.560
Why don't we finish this over drinks later? Yeah. Yeah. If a person is in you clinically,

40:06.560 --> 40:12.000
the bigger concern is that you'll flirt. That's the big, hey, why don't you do this?

40:12.000 --> 40:16.640
Why don't you look at him and say, you've seen the trailer. Are you ready for the presentation?

40:19.120 --> 40:22.880
And if he's not down with that, he was never meant to be because he's not a cool dude.

40:22.880 --> 40:29.840
Oh God. You're going to just keep coming to the open house or are you going to make an offer?

40:29.840 --> 40:35.760
Yeah. You're going to keep trying to sample nuggets. You can get an eight pack. You sicko.

40:38.400 --> 40:44.880
Oh God. You're going to keep taking these sampler platters to springtime Oreos.

40:44.880 --> 40:48.560
You're just going to go buy a package. That happened to me last week. It was awesome.

40:48.560 --> 40:56.640
Oh God. I don't think you can. I don't think you can tell if a person likes you or not.

40:57.680 --> 41:06.400
When they're when they're up ends. Yeah. There's no signal. There's they can't send you signals

41:06.400 --> 41:11.040
or maybe they can. Maybe guy knows like I've never. Oh, don't don't. No, no, no. I'm just

41:11.040 --> 41:15.120
saying. I'm just saying there's got to be a fucking smooth ass gynecologist out there.

41:15.120 --> 41:20.720
There has to be Jude Law PhD and he's up in you and he gives you a look and you're like,

41:20.720 --> 41:28.000
holy shit. Like, I think this dude, I think it might be on. This is happening. This is happening

41:28.000 --> 41:33.680
for real. It seems everything checks out. And on a personal note, nice, nice stuff.

41:33.680 --> 41:41.040
Nicely done. Good stuff. All of you. You cannot lose with the stuff you use. I really enjoyed that.

41:41.040 --> 41:47.680
I really enjoyed that. Personally speak clinically speaking. I listen from a professional standpoint.

41:47.680 --> 41:56.720
Neat Hyman. Is that the first time you said Hyman on the show? Yeah. Confetti shot out of my mind.

41:56.720 --> 42:03.760
This should be. I've got a banner hanging up. They just felt like you've the banner just says you've

42:03.760 --> 42:11.120
the banner just says you've said all the words. All the words that you should not say. You've said all

42:11.120 --> 42:17.360
of them. You said all the words. I've got a little checklist here. Let's see. Mons pubis. Yep.

42:20.320 --> 42:27.680
Smegma. Smegma. No. Yeah. Yeah. Episode 17. Smegma. And then Griffin, you said jizz earlier. Yeah,

42:27.680 --> 42:34.800
I did. Check that. Labia. Labia. Yep. Hey, my friend is trying to get me to go to a hip-hop

42:34.800 --> 42:40.480
dance class. I can't dance. I don't know anything about hip-hop. How do I lame out of the situation?

42:40.480 --> 42:46.320
Or should I put on my Nikes and just do it? P.S. I don't have Nikes. That's for Mindy in Columbus,

42:46.320 --> 42:51.520
Ohio. Step one. Get some Nikes. Get some Nikes. Hey, let me throw this out guys.

42:51.520 --> 42:57.600
This 20 does. If someone asked you to go to a hip-hop dance class, if someone asked me,

42:57.600 --> 43:03.200
I'd probably do it once. You do it once. Don't ever do it again if you don't dig it. But like,

43:03.200 --> 43:07.040
how will you know if you don't like hip-hop dance classes? It sounds like- Also, if your friend is

43:07.040 --> 43:13.680
persistent, going once gives you an out later to be like, no, I went and tried that and it was bad

43:13.680 --> 43:17.520
and I don't want to do it again. I hated that. Because if you don't go, they're just gonna keep

43:17.520 --> 43:24.480
asking. When you say no, three months from now, you guys are at the club, your friend starts

43:24.480 --> 43:33.440
fucking krumping so hard. Losing it. So hard that like- Dance battle erupts. People are physically-

43:33.440 --> 43:38.640
You've got to pop and lock for your territory. People are being pushed back by the krump waves

43:38.640 --> 43:42.880
that are coming off of your friend because they're just pounding it so fucking hard.

43:42.880 --> 43:48.080
They're krumping and you're kramping. Yeah. Their style. Just by being there. Just do it.

43:48.080 --> 43:54.720
You might like it. Now, I do have to say, I'm being very positive about this. If I'm at a hip-hop

43:54.720 --> 44:00.880
dance class, the first time the teacher's like, Justin, can you pop that and or lock it a little

44:00.880 --> 44:05.680
harder? I'm like, I'm out skis. My hand's in the air. Justin, you're bruising that move. I need

44:05.680 --> 44:13.760
you to bust it. I need to stop you both right here because I don't think either of you have watched

44:13.760 --> 44:19.840
a hip-hop music video in the past 15 fucking years because I do not think popping and locking it is

44:19.840 --> 44:26.800
still a thing that is commonplace. I do not think in a new Chris Brown video, people are moving like

44:26.800 --> 44:35.760
robots. Are people still busting a move? That is no, no. Young MC took that one to the fucking grave,

44:35.760 --> 44:43.600
dog. Now put some cardboard on the floor and spin around real fast. Oh yeah, did they do that head

44:43.600 --> 44:50.880
spin thing where like they kind of do it like a tornado? Teacher, would you like to see my tootsie

44:50.880 --> 44:57.600
roll? No, no, I wouldn't because it's fucking 2012. It is not 1999 anymore. I don't need you to

44:57.600 --> 45:04.640
teach me how to Dougie, but I would appreciate some notes on how to improve it. Ah, Charlie Brown.

45:04.640 --> 45:12.800
Nope, it's not. It's super not. Psst, when do we start working on the electric slide? We never did,

45:12.800 --> 45:18.560
never will. Never did that. Can't. It was never a thing. Excuse me, teach. Can you teach me how to

45:18.560 --> 45:22.960
teach? Can you teach me how to do that move of the guy in the fishing hat does where he shakes his

45:22.960 --> 45:31.840
head really fast and it looks like he's vibrating? I think it's in Breaking Two. Teach, teach. When

45:31.840 --> 45:40.400
do we start the partner work with the brooms? What are you talking about? Are you in Fantasia?

45:42.560 --> 45:48.400
Well, no, but now, yes. Teach, pardon me, when do we get the lesson about dancing on

45:48.400 --> 45:54.160
the ceiling? That's going to go on and on. Teach, when do we start the Jamiroquai work?

45:57.280 --> 46:02.720
Now Friday, we have a Jamiroquai workshop. We do have the room where the floor is a giant treadmill,

46:02.720 --> 46:08.480
so everyone, we're going to have a lot of fun. Yeah. Don't bring your bags in, please.

46:08.480 --> 46:13.680
Do not bring your bags, but do bring in your gigantic hats like Mr. Jamiroquai would wear.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.760
Did you guys know that the lead singer of Jamiroquai was just named Jamiroquai and

46:17.760 --> 46:25.120
it was just him? Now, is that true? No. He was actually the last of the Jamiroquai Indians.

46:25.120 --> 46:32.560
Exactly. Oh, Christ. My older sister recently watched Kick-Ass and decided she wants to be

46:32.560 --> 46:37.600
a real-life superhero. I don't want to discourage her, just the opposite. I want to help her get it

46:37.600 --> 46:42.480
in 20 Does, and if that involves helping her dress up in a costume and fight crime, then so be it.

46:43.200 --> 46:46.560
What can I do to help her get ready for her career as a crime fighter?

46:46.560 --> 46:50.880
Also, she hasn't come up with a name or theme for her persona, so any- I'm sorry,

46:50.880 --> 46:55.280
I said persona really bad. Let me try again. Persona. So any and all suggestions will be

46:55.280 --> 47:00.080
welcome. Aiming to be my sister's Alfred is the name of that question to ask her.

47:00.080 --> 47:02.000
First of all, I'm 100% behind this. No.

47:04.080 --> 47:08.320
Okay. See, we got conflicting opinions. This makes for good radio.

47:08.320 --> 47:18.000
It depends on how active your sister wants to be in the crime fighting process. If she wants to

47:19.680 --> 47:27.040
be a watcher, a lookout for crimes, and then contact the authorities,

47:28.880 --> 47:34.320
fucking open a newspaper and find any time where somebody being a vigilante ever turned out to be

47:34.320 --> 47:40.240
a good thing. No, but I think there's things like, you know, walking with people so that

47:40.240 --> 47:46.320
they're not walking by themselves late at night and jumping from rooftop to rooftop.

47:46.320 --> 47:50.320
Okay, but how long- that's going to keep your sister satisfied for maybe three days,

47:50.320 --> 47:54.960
and then she's going to go fucking full-blown George Zimmerman. Like, that's how this arc

47:54.960 --> 48:00.800
terminates. That's the fear. That's not the fear, that's the fucking 100% definite reality,

48:00.800 --> 48:08.000
unavoidable consequence. Okay, first, let us say don't do this. Secondly, when you do,

48:08.720 --> 48:12.960
first thing you gotta get is a taser. That's like a superpower, basically.

48:12.960 --> 48:17.600
Yeah, yeah, and then you tase somebody because you think they're committing a crime. Oops,

48:17.600 --> 48:21.760
they have a heart murmur. Dead. They weren't committing a crime. They were buying a fucking

48:21.760 --> 48:29.520
gumball from a gotcha gotcha machine, you stupid. So I think electric- electric last,

48:29.520 --> 48:34.800
this both way. Electric last is a bad idea. Okay. You know who's a good- you know who's

48:34.800 --> 48:42.160
a good crime fighter? Yell- yell for the cops, girl. Hey, I think this guy's committing a crime.

48:42.160 --> 48:46.240
9-1-1. Cops show up and he's buying a fucking gumball. At least you didn't kill him.

48:48.800 --> 48:51.280
Not like electric last we have in the back of the police car.

48:51.280 --> 49:00.000
Uh, here's the good news. We are a society that now spends 17 hours per day, on average,

49:00.000 --> 49:05.360
watching reality television and eating Thai food. That is basically the only two things that any of

49:05.360 --> 49:12.160
us do. We've gone thick- grown thick and slovenly, uh, but from the- from our disuse of our physical

49:12.160 --> 49:19.600
forms. If you take like a spinning class two times a week, you're basically a superhero.

49:19.600 --> 49:26.160
Like you are- if you bother to be even a little bit physically fit, you are- you are

49:26.160 --> 49:32.640
moved to the level of that super- super heroine. I've had a brainstorm. Okay. Okay. What if you

49:32.640 --> 49:38.880
were a non-crime fighting superhero? You were just a lazy superhero? No, no, no. No, no, no.

49:38.880 --> 49:45.440
You were a much more like activist superhero. You were like Recycle Girl or Captain Vegetable. No,

49:45.440 --> 49:50.480
then you're Captain- then you're Captain Fuck Clean-Off. Then you might as well be like,

49:51.360 --> 49:55.920
Sergeant, don't tell me how to live my life because that's- I don't want your guidance.

49:55.920 --> 50:04.640
You're in a leotard. I like Justin's idea of you can be a superhero just by being a little bit

50:04.640 --> 50:08.560
better than everyone else. If you've had a Twitter account for over a year and haven't said something

50:08.560 --> 50:17.520
shitty on it, congrats, Superman. Way to go. Nice- nice willpower there, Hal Jordan. Do you- do you,

50:17.520 --> 50:25.120
uh, never let the people who try to get around traffic jams by scooting up on the berm- if you

50:25.120 --> 50:30.000
never let those people in, you're a superhero. Oh, if you do that like half over the line thing

50:30.000 --> 50:34.480
so people can't get around, everyone behind you is like superhero. Yeah, yeah, that guy's a

50:34.480 --> 50:39.040
superhero because he's not letting- Oh, if you have figured out a way to politely honk at someone

50:39.040 --> 50:43.280
who doesn't realize the light has turned green but you don't sound like a dick, you're a superhero.

50:43.280 --> 50:46.720
No, wait, that would- that would be like an inventor-type superhero who invents a horn

50:46.720 --> 50:51.120
that's just like, uh, excuse me. Pardon? No, no, no, it's more that, like, you found the exact

50:51.120 --> 50:57.440
right length of time to press the horn. Oh, so it's just like- So they're confused? Like,

50:57.440 --> 51:02.400
was that a honk? Oh, the light changed. Oh, hey, oh my. Uh, is this the- is this the honks or hot

51:02.400 --> 51:06.880
line? I need you to come by and honk at somebody. He's been at this green light through 17 lights.

51:06.880 --> 51:11.280
It's- it's been three hours. Oh, he's might be dead. Hold on, yeah, oh yeah, he's dead.

51:11.280 --> 51:12.880
He's dead. God damn it, electric glass.

51:16.560 --> 51:20.960
This car is stolen, bazaap. Oh, wait, uh, fuck.

51:26.640 --> 51:29.600
I'm willing to bet that in real life there's not a lot of banter.

51:29.600 --> 51:36.320
Yeah, there's not like- Stop right- I don't want to stop, I'm a criminal. There's the banter. I

51:36.320 --> 51:40.720
want- I want to keep robbing. God damn it. I want to keep robbing people because I'm a robber.

51:42.240 --> 51:49.280
This is what I like doing. I like- I like to rob people and steal their things and have them for

51:49.280 --> 51:54.960
myself without working for them. Whenever I see somebody doing anything wrong, not even like a

51:54.960 --> 52:01.040
crime, but like, I don't know, they roll past the stop sign too fast. My immediate reaction is not

52:01.040 --> 52:08.320
like, what's wrong buddy, can't read? It's always like, oh fuck, fuck, oh god, oh god. Oh, here,

52:08.320 --> 52:13.920
I've got a great persona. Okay. Boomerang lass, because when you see something happening, you go

52:13.920 --> 52:20.800
away and come back later and they're gone. Yeah, that's- hey, what's up, I'm bad Samaritan.

52:20.800 --> 52:30.320
You could just hang around the grocery store and like help people. I'll tell you the superhero I

52:30.320 --> 52:35.840
need. I need cooking suggestion superhero. I'm like looking at three different kinds of pasta.

52:35.840 --> 52:40.480
Just tell me what fucking pesto to get so I can get out of here. I don't know anything about pesto

52:40.480 --> 52:45.360
sauce. Help me. That's a superhero I could get behind. Sure. What about a superhero that always

52:45.360 --> 52:51.280
helped me find a convenient parking space? I don't exactly know how that would work, but let's workshop.

52:51.280 --> 52:57.360
In Austin, in Austin, on some of the busier streets, homeless people will help you. They'll

52:57.360 --> 53:02.560
just like stand on the side of the, like they'll stand on a corner and just like point you to where

53:02.560 --> 53:08.480
an open parking space is. Really? Yeah. That's awesome. And I always, and then they come up to

53:08.480 --> 53:12.000
you and they're like, hey man, you're like, hey, you know, give me, give me some money. Because

53:12.000 --> 53:17.120
they basically just valeted for you. And then you, and then you say, you actually, I'm going to give

53:17.120 --> 53:22.720
you something better than that. I think you're a superhero. Bye. Put a cape on. Yeah. I'm super

53:22.720 --> 53:32.320
hungry. Yeah. Bye. Bye. I think you're a hero. In my book, flat you man. I think you're a hero.

53:33.680 --> 53:37.440
Captain ill-fitting charity t-shirt. You're my number one hero.

53:37.440 --> 53:44.720
When I, when I worked at GameStop once, I got robbed at gunpoint and before they robbed me,

53:44.720 --> 53:48.320
they asked if we had any PlayStation threes in stock. Cause it was right when the PlayStation

53:48.320 --> 53:53.520
three came out and I lied because they had their hoodies pulled up over their faces and their hands

53:53.520 --> 53:57.440
in their pockets. So I knew that robbing was about to happen. And I lied and I said, no,

53:57.440 --> 54:01.440
we don't have any PS threes. And we had a bunch and then they robbed us and took our money,

54:01.440 --> 54:06.880
but not our PlayStation threes. I guess my question is, am I a superhero? Well, you're super dumb.

54:06.880 --> 54:11.120
That was really dumb, but I think maybe really proud of you, but at the end of the day,

54:11.680 --> 54:15.760
they didn't get entertainment. Do you know how long before you were fired from that job?

54:15.760 --> 54:20.960
I wasn't fired. I quit at my own volition. I was awarded the medal of honor from Huntington's mayor.

54:21.760 --> 54:25.840
The GameStop medal of honor. He's like, yo, it's actually just a copy of a medal of honor.

54:29.600 --> 54:33.440
The mayor was like, those guys were trying to, those guys were trying to play,

54:33.440 --> 54:37.760
you know, heavenly sword. Those guys are trying to get their call of duty on and you stop them

54:37.760 --> 54:42.160
from doing that. And we appreciate that minor inconvenience that you almost traded your life for.

54:43.920 --> 54:48.480
Please take this copy of medal of honor. When they pulled it, when they, did you actually see the

54:48.480 --> 54:55.120
gun? Yeah, dog. They pulled out the fuck. I've got a gun. Trust me. Shh. Guess what's in here.

54:55.120 --> 55:00.240
You don't want to know, but it's a gun. When they pull out the gun, what was your response?

55:00.240 --> 55:07.200
My immediate response. Your first impulse. It was very, I mean, the first impulse was,

55:07.200 --> 55:14.880
can I kick over this counter? How high can my kicks get? How high and lethal would this kick

55:14.880 --> 55:21.040
be if I delivered it? And that impulse lasted for maybe a thousandth of a second, which I think is

55:21.040 --> 55:30.880
pretty brave. And then it was, oh God, why did I lie about those space station threes?

55:31.600 --> 55:34.560
I hope they don't go in the back. Help me. Sonic the hedgehog.

55:38.240 --> 55:40.400
Leap into action. Mario cut out. Yeah.

55:43.040 --> 55:46.800
Shit. This has been our comedy podcast, my brother, my brother, and me,

55:46.800 --> 55:51.840

want to share our program with somebody, why not tweet a link to our sampler? It's bit.ly forward

56:28.640 --> 56:35.840
slash It's MBMBAM. It's a great way to get other people on board with the program. Best way we

56:35.840 --> 56:41.280
have of growing. Also, if you haven't seen yet, they announced the Max Fun Con East lineup,

56:41.840 --> 56:47.520
and it's pretty amazing. And it includes a lot of great names like John Hodgman and Dick Cavett

56:47.520 --> 56:52.400
and the Stop Podcasting Yourselves guys. But more than that, Michael Ian Black is going to be there.

56:52.960 --> 56:58.720
And how mad are you? I'm so mad. So if you haven't got tickets, I think there are still

56:58.720 --> 57:04.560
some available. So go get them now, maxfuncon.com, and you get all the information there. I want to

57:04.560 --> 57:09.040
thank John Roderick, Long Winter, for the use of our theme song. It's a departure off the album,

57:09.040 --> 57:14.000
Putting the Days to Bed. Thank you, John Roderick. You can pay him back by giving a listen to

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Roderick on the line. It's his podcast that he does with Marilyn Mann from You Look Nice Today.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.320
It's fantastic. If you would like to send us a question about something going on in your life,

57:22.320 --> 57:28.320
you need advice, or you'd like to send us a link to a Yahoo Answers question that strikes you as

57:28.320 --> 57:38.320
funny, email it to mbmbam at maximum fun dot org. Also, listener Ryan Mount emailed us to point out

57:38.320 --> 57:44.480
we talked last week about a roller derby name of Hannah Barbaric. And I was corrected in that

57:44.480 --> 57:49.200
there already is a Hannah Barbaric right here working with the Cincinnati Roller Girls. So I

57:49.200 --> 57:54.000
want to give a shout out to my girls at the Cincinnati Roller Girls. Now when you say your

57:54.000 --> 58:00.320
girls, you mean women that you've never, ever, ever, ever met before. I've actually met a couple

58:00.320 --> 58:03.760
of them. One of them worked at our theater for a while. Okay. And I want to give out to the

58:03.760 --> 58:08.640
Chemical Valley Roller Girls. What up? That's my team. I bet the Cincinnati Roller Girls could

58:08.640 --> 58:14.880
kick your roller girls asses. Well, maybe they'll have a bout and whip it. Figure it out. A throw

58:14.880 --> 58:19.520
down showdown? Throw down showdown. This final Yahoo Answer was sent in by Krista Whalen. Thank

58:19.520 --> 58:27.440
you, Krista. It's by Yahoo Answers user Assman, who asks, in Home Alone, why did the cameraman

58:27.440 --> 58:42.080
just film everything and not call the cops? That's the best. That's the best ever. I'm

58:42.080 --> 58:52.560
Justin McElroy. This has been my brother, my brother and me. Kiss your dad. School wear on

58:52.560 --> 59:01.680
the lips. Keep your heart, three stacks. Keep your heart. Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

59:01.680 --> 59:12.480
Keep your heart. Man, these girls are smart. Three stacks, these girls are smart. Play your part.
