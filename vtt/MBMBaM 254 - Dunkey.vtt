WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.040
Is he gone? Is the- check through the bar, see if he's gone.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.640
He stepped out. He went to go- he was empty and he had to go grab a refill.

00:51.200 --> 00:57.360
Okay. Hey everybody, um, we don't have long. We have at most an hour. This is Justin McElroy,

00:57.360 --> 01:03.680
and welcome to my brother, my brother and me 2.0 live from the, uh, Black Sight Powerade

01:03.680 --> 01:08.480
Gulag prison deep within the bowels of Middle America. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.240
I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy. I'm your baby-est brother Griffin McElroy.

01:12.240 --> 01:18.640
Powerade is light and Powerade is life. Griffin, you have to fight. We've been taken captive by

01:18.640 --> 01:24.720
Powerade because of our, uh, negative messages that we've sent and because we're in violation-

01:24.720 --> 01:32.480
listen, guys, listen. Read the fine print. If you're going to commit to a contract on a relaunch

01:32.480 --> 01:39.040
of your podcast sponsored by Powerade- Mmm, Powerade even sits music to my ears, that brand.

01:39.040 --> 01:46.000
Griffin, you gotta snap out of it. We've been locked inside a Powerade conditioning plant

01:46.000 --> 01:54.640
where not only is Powerade the first- the first destroyer. Not only is Powerade made here,

01:54.640 --> 01:58.720
but also it's a secret reprogramming facility where we are being held captive.

01:58.720 --> 02:04.720
Powerade is double plus good is what they want us to say, but I refuse Powerade. It's the devil.

02:04.720 --> 02:09.200
It's the devil. I never knew how deep this went. I'm- I don't- I don't want you guys to think

02:09.200 --> 02:14.400
I've been reprogrammed. Is the- the thing is that I have suckled the jellies from the Powerade queen

02:15.040 --> 02:20.480
directly from her larvae tap. Well, you shouldn't have done that. No one told you to do that.

02:20.480 --> 02:24.880
But now I'm clean. I guess it's hard. It's really hard to explain this feeling.

02:25.600 --> 02:31.760
Anytime we reach for a beverage or food that does not include the word mountain, alpine,

02:31.760 --> 02:39.040
or blasted, we are smacked across the face by a very large gentleman named Raul. And it is highly

02:39.040 --> 02:43.680
unpleasant because he has been drinking a lot of Powerade. So he is- Double strong.

02:43.680 --> 02:49.280
Supreme slapping energy. And- and his palms are really moist. I don't know if that's from the

02:49.280 --> 02:53.840
Powerade, maybe he's just so hydrated that it can't- because his palms are like moist with

02:53.840 --> 02:59.280
blue liquid. That's the- that's the worst part is we've become reverse dehydrated. Yeah. I don't

02:59.280 --> 03:04.480
know if there's a word for reverse dehydrated, but that is what we have become. Whatever the inverse

03:04.480 --> 03:10.560
of cottonmouth is, uh, uh, uh, sloppy gums, we have that. We got- we got sloppy gums real bad,

03:10.560 --> 03:13.600
you guys. I'm not gonna lie to you. But you know what? We're not gonna let that stop us

03:14.240 --> 03:18.240
from taking your questions and turning them alchemy-like into wisdom. Let me just say this

03:18.240 --> 03:23.680
though. In this economy, you gotta- you gotta take those brand relationships where you can get them.

03:23.680 --> 03:30.400
And- and honestly, we're in a black site gulag, and I get slapped a lot more often- yes, okay.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.800
I'm a fan of the Powerade product. I do get slapped a lot more often than I would like

03:34.800 --> 03:41.760
on a day-to-day basis by a big, big- oh my gosh, it's a very strong man. Um, but I'm not complaining

03:41.760 --> 03:49.040
because I'm getting that cheddar. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Not actual cheddar. It's not real cheddar,

03:49.600 --> 03:53.680
um, and it's not- We're not getting paid for this deal. We already made that perfectly clear. Well,

03:53.680 --> 03:58.640
energy- well, energy fluid. I mean, you can't- you can't spend it at a store. You can't deposit

03:58.640 --> 04:03.520
your energy fluid in a bank, but it keeps you energized, I think. Keeps your gum sloppy. I guess-

04:03.520 --> 04:07.920
You can deposit it in your life bank, in your- in your soul bank, where the energy goes.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.920
I just- I- I think you guys are looking a gift horse in the wet mouth.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.760
A gift queen. We're looking at a gift queen in her pupus.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.320
You're looking at the gift queen's thorax.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.560
And maybe you can't see- you can't see the gift queen for the pupus, as I always say.

04:23.600 --> 04:29.040
I'm in a moral quandary. I broke up with my ex six months ago, and now I'm stuck with Albatross

04:29.040 --> 04:32.880
in my underwear drawer. While we were together, he surprised me on my birthday by telling me to

04:32.880 --> 04:40.800
close my eyes, and he- and placing an unidentified phallic object in my hands. Upon opening my eyes,

04:40.800 --> 04:49.600
I discovered that this object was a- Hit it. Ramp over it. Ramp over this. Do it.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.520
Keep it down, Raul can hear you.

04:51.520 --> 04:56.160
A DIY vibrating dildo cast from his own erect penis.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.760
I'm glad it was erect.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.480
Yeah, thank you for clarifying erect. God forbid.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.280
Is this a plastic Cheeto? What am I supposed to do with this?

05:04.720 --> 05:09.600
Understandably, now that we have broken up and I am in a new relationship, I would like to return it.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.480
Brothers, is there any way on earth to tactfully return my ex-boyfriend's manhood?

05:20.640 --> 05:22.960
That's from shunning the schlong in Sydney.

05:23.760 --> 05:29.200
I- all I get- I want there to be a scene of your new boyfriend like going to grab something and

05:29.200 --> 05:35.520
being like, honey, what is- what is this? Honey, have you seen my sunglasses? What is this?

05:35.520 --> 05:36.960
This looks like Mark, kind of.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I assume- Honey, is this Mark's penis?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.600
This looks like a full swollen Mark. This looks like an engorged Mark.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.120
This looks like a hundred percent unadulterated pure uncut Mark.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.640
Well, cut. But you know what I mean. Cut. But you know what I mean, yeah.

05:50.640 --> 05:56.320
Um, I- at first blush, I think why do you need to return it, throw it in the garbage,

05:56.320 --> 06:00.720
and then throw that- Yes, correct. And then throw that garbage in a bigger garbage container

06:00.720 --> 06:05.040
so that it will never- so that the- the light will never shine upon it.

06:05.040 --> 06:12.080
But at the same time, this is a DIY vibrating dildo cast from his own erect penis.

06:12.080 --> 06:17.840
There are several levels of mastery being, uh, illustrated here.

06:17.840 --> 06:23.920
Like, to cast your own penis is impressive. First of all, to cast it, right, you got to get it

06:23.920 --> 06:30.880
going and you got to get those juices- you got to get your craft noodle going long enough to cast it.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.400
Yeah, then maintain that.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.760
Then maintain it. Yeah, exactly.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.320
That's impressive.

06:34.320 --> 06:40.160
While you cover it in papier-mache and that's- I mean, that's a number one boner killer because

06:40.160 --> 06:44.000
that like hardens and constricts and you would think that's a bad scene down there.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.840
Um, so that's impressive. And then to actually fabricate a dildo from that mold,

06:49.840 --> 06:55.280
really impressive. And then to imbue it with a- with a motor.

06:55.280 --> 07:00.480
It's a- I'm- I'm kind of flabbergasted at the work. I mean, this is a- this is a good two-month project.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.440
Do you think that he had to lose the penis to actually do the cast?

07:05.440 --> 07:05.840
Oh, man.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.280
Do you think that it stayed in the mold?

07:08.240 --> 07:14.240
I mean, Justin, hold on. Are you acting if he removed his own penis in order to do this?

07:14.240 --> 07:17.360
Like, for the sake of the gift, he was like, this must be done.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.680
Susan deserves the best.

07:19.680 --> 07:25.760
I just figured out why she can't throw it away because you- you- if you throw it away,

07:25.760 --> 07:30.960
what if you accidentally- this seems unlikely. What if you accidentally left it on and vibrating

07:30.960 --> 07:36.160
when you threw it away? Because then it would be in two trash cans and you'd see the trash can

07:36.160 --> 07:40.960
vibrating and then you'd have to start digging through the trash and that would be a sight

07:40.960 --> 07:45.360
if anybody were to come across that because then they would have to see you digging through trash

07:45.360 --> 07:50.960
desperately trying to find a vibrating dildo cast in the shape of Mark's penis.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.640
Oh, we've all been there.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.000
We've all been there.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.320
Best episode of Seinfeld ever, by the way.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.760
When he drops the- when he drops the dildo cast from his own penis that he

07:59.760 --> 08:03.680
had imbued with motors and life and he dropped it inside of the surgery.

08:03.680 --> 08:12.800
The weirdest thing about the DIY angle is how long do you think he had to sort of,

08:12.800 --> 08:19.360
like, agonize and debate about color of it? Because what color really captures your penis?

08:19.360 --> 08:20.480
Like, what, you know-

08:20.480 --> 08:20.880
Amber.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.080
Amber is the color of your penis energy.

08:24.960 --> 08:29.760
I mean, well, it's just my energy in general. I don't have a discrete penis energy color.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.560
It's part of the- if you'll forgive the pun- the whole package.

08:32.560 --> 08:40.080
I don't understand why this question was not- so I just threw it in a lake and now I want some

08:40.080 --> 08:44.080
advice on some fun lake activities that I can do while I'm here.

08:44.080 --> 08:48.160
Is this a thing that your ex-boyfriend has been asking for it back?

08:48.160 --> 08:48.880
Like, what?

08:48.880 --> 08:52.800
There is no use for this whatsoever at this point.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.400
It is the end of your relationship and it should have disintegrated into ash.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.800
You're not going to hand it to him and him go,

08:58.800 --> 09:01.840
well, I understand. Thank you very much for returning this.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.440
Maybe I can get my money back?

09:04.000 --> 09:08.720
What if he- what if he could fashion it further into a strap-on and then it's like,

09:08.720 --> 09:12.160
you do not see this coming. It's me too, penis mark.

09:14.480 --> 09:14.880
I haven't-

09:14.880 --> 09:16.240
Which penis is real?

09:16.240 --> 09:20.080
Oh, welcome to the hall of mirrors and penises.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.080
It's mirrors and penises. Good luck.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.720
You're never getting out of here alive.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.800
Do you guys want a yahoo?

09:26.800 --> 09:27.840
Yes, please.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.840
Let's keep this dildo bender going.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.640
Let's keep this dildo vibrating.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.360
Let's not also say dildo bender ever again.

09:35.360 --> 09:39.040
This one was sent in by Jacob Wells and Evan Jones Thorn.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.280
I got this from two different people.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.240
So you know it's a good one.

09:43.040 --> 09:43.840
Thank you, you too.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.240
It's by yahoo answers user Shershaah, who says and asks,

09:49.840 --> 09:51.760
Someone threw a dildo to my window.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.800
Okay, so I never experienced any- something paranormal,

09:56.800 --> 10:00.320
but I remember something unusual happened around two years ago.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.680
It was like one hour after midnight and I was planning to go to sleep,

10:03.680 --> 10:07.760
but first I went to the bathroom when suddenly I was standing behind a window

10:07.760 --> 10:10.960
and I noticed something long and white clashed to my window.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.160
It almost looked like it fell from the clouds to my window.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.680
Then I went outside to check what was going on, but there was nothing going on.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.680
And keep in mind, my garden was closed with walls so nobody could get there.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.760
Never wanted to talk about this because it's really weird.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.400
It happened two years ago, but what do you think it was?

10:28.400 --> 10:37.360
Come to my window, chuck a donker, watch as it thuds against glass.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.480
I like that this happened and this person go,

10:40.480 --> 10:42.320
this is too weird to ever speak of.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.720
No one would understand the brush with the supernatural I have had.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.440
And then they launched yahoo answers and they were like, I am home.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.920
Now we're in this question.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.560
Now we're in this question, do they confirm this was a dildo?

11:00.560 --> 11:01.920
Except in the headline of it.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.280
It could, let me hit you with this.

11:03.280 --> 11:03.760
A thing that is-

11:03.760 --> 11:05.520
You're thinking clickbait?

11:05.520 --> 11:07.600
Maybe it wasn't a dildo, they're just trying to get some readers?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.680
Yeah, I think they maximize their SEO.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.080
And I'm learning a lesson from this as a content producer

11:12.800 --> 11:15.680
that I need to apparently just squeeze dildos in well.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.480
But like, here's a thing that's in the sky that runs into windows a lot

11:22.480 --> 11:24.720
and then typically vanishes is birds.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.440
Ghosts.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.320
Dildo birds.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.200
Oh, birds.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.600
No, just regular old birds.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.560
They hit windows all the time

11:30.560 --> 11:34.160
because they have a hard time understanding, you know, translucence.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.640
Or did they go out and search for the dildo

11:36.640 --> 11:38.960
but no dildo was to be found?

11:38.960 --> 11:40.960
I can swear it sounded like a dildo.

11:42.160 --> 11:46.160
Listen, I know a dildo when I hear one hitting a second story window

11:46.160 --> 11:48.720
and that sir was a dildo.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.680
How much do dildos cost if you don't make them yourself?

11:51.680 --> 11:53.200
Well, depends Griffin.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.440
Like, are you looking for your basic model?

11:55.440 --> 11:57.760
Are you looking for one with all the bells and whistles?

11:57.760 --> 12:00.640
I'm saying like the standard issue, the dildo you buy at Walmart.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.600
I think about $50.

12:02.160 --> 12:02.640
$50?

12:03.920 --> 12:05.680
If you really want to get dildos.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.840
No, I'm talking about the-

12:07.840 --> 12:10.720
You're just talking about like just a basic dildo.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.760
A bulk dildo.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.040
The Volvo dildo.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.960
Yeah, the Mazda.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.560
Like a bottom shelf, like a two buck chuck dildo.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.240
The Honda Fit dildo.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.000
Okay.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.280
Um, you know what?

12:23.280 --> 12:25.840
ExtremeRestrains.com, answer this for us.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.240
Oh, pops right up when I type in EX in my search bar.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.360
Terrific.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.160
Dildos and insertables.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.440
I would say you're looking at like $10 to $15.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.440
$10 to $15, okay.

12:39.440 --> 12:44.800
We are all in our own way looking for a way to make our mark on this world.

12:44.800 --> 12:52.880
Um, I think you could do much worse than dropping $1,000 on a hundred dildos.

12:53.680 --> 12:58.960
And then for one night, and just for shorthand, we'll call it from this point forward,

12:58.960 --> 13:00.240
the best night of your life.

13:01.040 --> 13:06.160
You just go from house to house pelting windows with dildos, like Johnny Dildo Seed.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.640
And then you-

13:08.640 --> 13:11.600
And wherever the dildos fall, a dildo tree grows.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.120
It's going to make the news, guaranteed.

13:15.120 --> 13:15.680
Guaranteed.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.040
Guaranteed it's going to make the nightly news.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.040
Conan is probably going to riff about it.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.640
Drudge is there.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.520
It's a conspiracy.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.520
Drudge is definitely, definitely going to report on this.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.120
Loose change to-

13:25.120 --> 13:28.720
Loose change to the dildo windows mystery.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.280
The splurge.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.080
Serial season two.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.680
Serial season two.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.040
The dildo storm.

13:35.040 --> 13:41.440
But what I want to talk about is not the worldwide cultural implications,

13:41.440 --> 13:44.080
but about the 100 lives that you have transformed.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.880
Oh, like that movie Seven Pounds.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.240
It's just like the movie Seven Pounds, except instead of killing yourself

13:50.240 --> 13:55.360
and giving your organs to people, you buy a hundred dildos for a thousand dollars

13:55.360 --> 13:57.200
with an amazing value at extreme exchange.

13:57.200 --> 14:01.120
They almost definitely, they almost definitely offer bulk pricing.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.080
Bulk rates, for sure.

14:02.080 --> 14:02.400
For sure.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.200
And you maybe-

14:03.200 --> 14:07.520
Gervan, what would you think about the idea of maybe writing something on the dildo?

14:07.520 --> 14:07.920
Keep it up.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.680
That just says, well, that just says like, tomorrow's a new day.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.480
Or like, think about how your life is different tomorrow.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.440
That's a little lengthy.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.080
Just something-

14:16.080 --> 14:16.640
How about this?

14:16.640 --> 14:17.200
How about this?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.320
This is not a dildo.

14:19.040 --> 14:19.540
Ooh.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.120
This, or like this could have been, like, think about what could have been.

14:25.120 --> 14:28.720
Maybe a dildo that makes you reflect on all your choices up till now

14:28.720 --> 14:31.040
and makes you kind of like, Ebenezer screwed yourself.

14:31.040 --> 14:31.520
That's a whole-

14:31.520 --> 14:32.320
Really not taken.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.480
That's a whole episode of Serial right there.

14:35.040 --> 14:35.360
Right there.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.000
Now I want to talk, we've talked about the dildo trajectory,

14:38.560 --> 14:41.840
the angle, the pricing, the bulk pricing at Extreme Restraints.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.160
Today I want to focus on something we mentioned in the pilot

14:46.160 --> 14:50.240
of this second season of Serial that very few people are listening to now.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.480
And that was the message that was inscribed on each dildo.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.880
Is there a payphone outside Extreme Restraints?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.840
That's what we'll talk about next time on Serial.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.800
You know, we've had a lot of fun here today,

15:04.800 --> 15:08.320
but I think we should take a moment to reflect on the sheer terror

15:09.040 --> 15:13.120
that that paper boy felt when he reached into his bag at the end of his shift

15:13.120 --> 15:16.080
and found one extra paper and no dildo.

15:18.560 --> 15:22.960
Why, he thought to himself, why did I keep my extra dildo in there?

15:22.960 --> 15:23.520
Yeah.

15:23.520 --> 15:23.840
This is so embarrassing.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.120
Oh, I had to take that dildo to the dildo shop to get it repaired.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.160
How embarrassing for me.

15:30.160 --> 15:35.360
Oh, listen, he had a dog was chasing him, a tire for some reason,

15:35.360 --> 15:37.280
a sentient tire was rolling after him.

15:37.280 --> 15:41.280
He had to avoid oil slicks and people opening their doors.

15:41.280 --> 15:41.920
It's hard out there.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.000
There was a hand coming out of the gutter?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.720
There's a, if memory serves, there was a hand coming out of the gutter.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.080
Sometimes you just chuck a dildo.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.920
My friend works at a bagel shop and at the end of the day,

15:53.920 --> 15:56.880
the employees are allowed to take home any of the leftover bagels that didn't sell.

15:56.880 --> 16:02.800
Well, my question is, should I continue accepting his kind carb loaded gifts

16:02.800 --> 16:05.680
or is eating stale bagels going to lead to an early death?

16:05.680 --> 16:09.600
More importantly, can I leave the bagels in my fridge and eat them two days after?

16:09.600 --> 16:15.520
Three, four, that's from bone for bagels in Baltimore.

16:17.600 --> 16:22.320
I have a theory about this and there's an important factor to this question.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.320
And that is your age.

16:25.200 --> 16:25.440
Yeah.

16:25.440 --> 16:30.400
Hmm. I think that there's a certain age at which you should cut yourself off

16:30.400 --> 16:35.200
from accepting leftover food from a friend's employment.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.520
And what age is that, Travis?

16:37.520 --> 16:40.960
It feels like to me that age is like 25, 26.

16:40.960 --> 16:41.920
Wow, that's old.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.080
That is a lot older than I thought it was going to be.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.360
How old were you going to say?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.440
20, 21.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.840
No, you got to get out of college and past a couple years

16:51.840 --> 16:53.280
where you're trying to figure some things out.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.080
That's what I'm saying.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.520
So like 24? I thought you were going to talk about the ramifications

16:57.520 --> 16:58.640
that this has on your body.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.960
I was actually thinking at the grocery store yesterday,

17:00.960 --> 17:02.160
you know, I like bagels.

17:02.160 --> 17:02.400
Yeah.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.080
I really do. I love a good bagel.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.120
I can't have those in the house.

17:05.120 --> 17:05.840
I know, nor-

17:05.840 --> 17:08.160
What am I going to do? Eat a bagel for breakfast?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.520
I'll have a bagel thin.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.280
I'll certainly get down on a bagel thin.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.880
Yes, of course a bagel thin.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.000
But if I ate a bagel thick-

17:14.000 --> 17:14.720
With smoked salmon?

17:15.360 --> 17:20.000
If I ate a bagel Alan thick, that's my day and possibly my week.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.600
I think this is a bad business strategy for this guy

17:23.600 --> 17:26.400
because if you're an employee and somebody comes in,

17:27.040 --> 17:32.640
your main goal, your sustainability as a going concern

17:33.360 --> 17:36.720
is tied to you not selling all of that day's bagels.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.120
Yeah.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.560
What if someone comes in and they're like,

17:38.560 --> 17:40.880
I want 30 bagels, that's going to tap you out.

17:40.880 --> 17:44.400
You think, well, you know, ma'am, that may be too many bagels.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.400
Maybe you want a-

17:46.400 --> 17:47.680
Sorry, were you confused?

17:47.680 --> 17:48.880
These are thick bagels.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.960
You get that, right?

17:50.960 --> 17:52.240
Oh, those bagels?

17:52.240 --> 17:54.480
You don't want those bagels.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.600
There's a, that raises a question I've always pondered.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.600
There's this chain of like sort of bagel,

18:01.600 --> 18:03.920
coffee, pastry places called Pret-a-Manger.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.040
I'm probably murdering-

18:05.040 --> 18:05.280
One more time.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.160
The pronunciation of that.

18:06.160 --> 18:06.960
Pret-a-Manger.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.960
I'm probably murdering the pronunciation.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.480
It's pronounced Starbucks, Justin.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.560
At the end of the day, they have these signs.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.640
At the end of the day, they donate the food

18:16.640 --> 18:18.800
that they don't sell to local homeless shelters.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.680
So this has always bothered me because if you-

18:21.680 --> 18:23.520
Wow, Justin, why does that, wow.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.120
Well, let me tell you-

18:25.120 --> 18:26.480
Fuck those places.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.440
No, let me tell you-

18:27.440 --> 18:28.720
Just throw it away.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.680
There's method to my method.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.280
By shopping there-

18:33.840 --> 18:34.880
Oh, I see.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.240
You are, with every bagel that you buy there,

18:38.240 --> 18:41.040
you are taking out of the mouth of a homeless person.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.880
Think about that.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.800
You know what I would do in both scenarios

18:44.800 --> 18:46.800
if I worked at these places?

18:46.800 --> 18:49.600
Either I get to take them home or they go to the less fortunate.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.800
Both are equal in my eyes.

18:50.800 --> 18:55.600
I think that I would make a big old batch of bagels

18:55.600 --> 18:57.200
two minutes before closing.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.920
Oh, you're like Robin Hood, but for yeast.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.040
Yeah, set them out and be like,

19:01.040 --> 19:02.000
mm, guess it didn't sell.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.760
And then just put them right into my bag

19:03.760 --> 19:05.440
or give them to the less fortunate.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.440
How long do you think this grift's gonna last, Travis?

19:07.440 --> 19:08.640
Not long, Justin.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.560
But my question is this, in this scenario,

19:10.560 --> 19:12.640
how many bagels is your friend bringing back?

19:12.640 --> 19:14.880
Because maybe he works at a failing bagel place.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.360
Maybe they're not doing so hot.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.280
If they're overproducing like this, I guarantee,

19:19.280 --> 19:21.120
I don't even need to look at their books.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.240
They're failing.

19:22.240 --> 19:22.480
Yeah.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.120
They're failing.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.720
It's all about supply and demand.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.440
You can just get Amazon Prime, get bagels next day.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, for sure.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.280
Or same day bagels.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.160
They'll do that for you.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.880
They'll drone those bagels right to you.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.280
I think, Justin, to return to your point,

19:35.280 --> 19:36.960
that is a marketing ploy.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.320
Because when you buy a bagel from,

19:40.480 --> 19:42.320
you are understanding that you are robbing

19:43.600 --> 19:45.600
a more needful person.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.680
And so knowing that, and knowing that people are still doing it,

19:49.680 --> 19:52.720
those must be some pretty good bagels.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.000
Oh, I see.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.960
Bagels that are worth stealing from a homeless person.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.240
Pret-a-mer-mer-mer.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.960
Bagels so good, you'll lose your sense of caring

20:00.960 --> 20:02.000
for your fellow man.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.800
I would like a bagel with everything,

20:04.800 --> 20:06.720
and I want that to include guilt.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.120
I want everything to also have that in it.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.320
I would like a bagel to eat, and then a bagel just to throw away,

20:12.320 --> 20:13.920
so I know no one else gets it.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.240
I know no one else gets it.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.360
I like to feed one very lucky bird a day,

20:19.360 --> 20:20.560
one entire bagel.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.000
Do you guys know Yahoo?

20:22.720 --> 20:22.960
Yeah.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.800
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski,

20:24.800 --> 20:25.840
climbing that ladder.

20:25.840 --> 20:26.400
Thank you, Zoe.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, John Blix, who asks...

20:30.000 --> 20:33.120
This is my favorite question we've had in a very long time.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.840
I'm a big time lawyer in the city, and yet...

20:39.680 --> 20:40.320
Let me finish.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.880
I'm a big time lawyer in the city,

20:42.880 --> 20:45.920
and yet I'm addicted to donkey basketball.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.120
All I think about, is this okay?

20:50.960 --> 20:53.120
It started as a corporate fundraiser.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.960
We had a gym reserved, and a company provided us with the donkeys.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.840
It seemed innocent enough until game time,

20:59.840 --> 21:01.680
when everything seemed to slow down,

21:01.680 --> 21:03.440
and I became entranced with the game.

21:04.160 --> 21:07.200
Every aspect of it seemed logical and right.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.720
When the final buzzer sounded,

21:08.720 --> 21:11.120
I had thrown up the game-winning shot.

21:11.120 --> 21:11.680
Buckets.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.640
My teammates rode over to me to congratulate me,

21:14.640 --> 21:17.440
and I had never received such euphoria.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.360
That night, I could not sleep.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.040
I think about it during meetings,

21:21.040 --> 21:23.600
and it is starting to interfere with my home life,

21:23.600 --> 21:25.120
and I'm even a Republican.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.000
I am thinking about getting professional help,

21:28.000 --> 21:29.520
because I see no solution.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.440
I do not want to stop thinking about it,

21:31.440 --> 21:34.720
but I also do not want it to further hinder my life.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.600
Across the city, they have another charity function,

21:37.600 --> 21:39.200
and I am thinking about going,

21:39.200 --> 21:41.440
even though I am not invited to go.

21:41.440 --> 21:41.940
I'm excited.

21:44.720 --> 21:51.280
If this is not the construction of the various,

21:51.840 --> 21:56.000
you know, wins and changes in shifting tectonic plates

21:56.000 --> 21:57.360
that create our reality,

21:57.360 --> 21:58.560
if this is not a product of that,

21:58.560 --> 22:02.880
but rather a shitty in-joke reference to,

22:02.880 --> 22:06.560
like, a really terrible Bradley Cooper movie he made

22:06.560 --> 22:08.240
before he was Bradley Cooper

22:08.240 --> 22:11.600
that someone got for $1.50 from the hidden treasure shelf

22:11.600 --> 22:13.680
at Dollar General, I'm going to be very...

22:13.680 --> 22:14.720
And what would that movie be called?

22:15.440 --> 22:15.920
Donkey.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.120
Donkey.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.280
The basketball playing donkey.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.440
You guys understand that it's not the donkeys.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.440
There are people housed.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.040
Don't fucking ruin this for me.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.960
I want a little magic left in the world, Griffin.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.440
No, you can find different kinds of magic.

22:33.440 --> 22:37.120
It is important for me, as your brother,

22:37.120 --> 22:38.800
that the two of you understand,

22:38.800 --> 22:44.320
no, there are human beings firmly housed upon these donks.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.440
Go for three, donkey.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.720
I forgot which animal we were talking about.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.160
I could only dunk, boss.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.600
I can't dunk from three.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.800
You can do it, donkey.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.880
Bray, bray, bray, bray.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.560
Bray to the Lord, donkey.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.560
It also has strong religious undertones.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.800
That's one blessed beast.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.800
I am a big time lawyer in the city,

23:09.600 --> 23:11.760
and I'm addicted to donkey basketball.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.960
Your honor, if you refer to the folder of evidence

23:14.960 --> 23:18.000
I've handed you, these are just pictures of donkeys

23:18.000 --> 23:19.120
playing basketball.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.240
Oh, I must have grabbed the wrong briefcase.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.080
I need a recess.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.680
Oh no, I'm getting too stressed out

23:25.680 --> 23:27.520
and I'm transforming into donkey.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.000
Basketball playing donkey.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.840
Oh no, I ate some spicy food

23:31.840 --> 23:33.680
and now I'm transforming into donkey.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.720
I'm transforming into donkey.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.400
The basketball playing donkey.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.080
Can somebody say hey?

23:40.320 --> 23:41.120
How embarrassing.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.640
There's a gray bristly hair

23:44.640 --> 23:47.280
coming out of my fancy lawyer collar.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.200
And I've got a big old donkey boner.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.160
Can we go what episode without referencing Turbo Team?

23:54.160 --> 23:56.160
Is that like physically possible

23:56.160 --> 23:57.920
to keep us from talking about Turbo Team

23:57.920 --> 23:59.280
for a single episode?

23:59.280 --> 24:01.440
That was also in the Powerade contract.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.240
Would this person be okay with their

24:05.360 --> 24:08.240
incurable addiction to donkey basketball

24:08.240 --> 24:09.680
if they were not a big time lawyer?

24:09.680 --> 24:11.040
Like if they were just a,

24:11.040 --> 24:13.040
if they were in law school even.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.600
I mean, first of all, if you're in law school,

24:15.600 --> 24:17.600
you wouldn't have the time, I don't think, to indulge.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.120
I think what we're dealing with here, Griffin,

24:19.120 --> 24:21.440
is a matter of public image.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.480
If you're like a defense lawyer,

24:24.480 --> 24:26.640
like a family lawyer, or even like,

24:26.640 --> 24:28.560
let's say like a contract lawyer,

24:28.560 --> 24:31.040
you can be into donkey basketball.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.440
But if you're a big time lawyer in the city,

24:33.440 --> 24:35.440
you need to be in like gorilla basketball,

24:35.440 --> 24:37.120
something much higher class.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.080
Oh, silverback gorilla.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.520
Maybe even human basketball.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.200
That's where one human rides on another human

24:45.200 --> 24:47.440
to play basketball upon them.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.360
But they do wear long trench coats,

24:49.360 --> 24:51.760
so it appears to just be super tall humans.

24:51.760 --> 24:52.240
I see.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.280
That's really weird, Travis,

24:55.280 --> 24:56.720
because I was about to suggest

24:56.720 --> 24:58.160
that you disguise yourself

24:58.160 --> 25:00.400
by going to donkey basketball games,

25:00.400 --> 25:02.640
by getting a friend to sit on your shoulders,

25:02.640 --> 25:04.960
and then wearing an extra long trench coat,

25:04.960 --> 25:07.040
so people just think there's a really tall man there.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.880
And not care about his profession

25:08.880 --> 25:11.360
or the jurisdiction in which he practices.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.160
Well, they'll just assume his profession

25:12.160 --> 25:13.600
is world's tallest man.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.080
Yeah.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.280
No, if you see someone that tall,

25:15.280 --> 25:17.120
you assume that they're scouting donkeys

25:17.120 --> 25:18.240
for human basketball.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.600
This is the next big thing I'm telling you.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.360
Donkey players.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.120
Guys, I just wish I knew more about basketball

25:27.120 --> 25:28.800
to make better jokes.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.720
That's the only problem,

25:30.720 --> 25:32.880
is I already said dunk and three pointer.

25:32.880 --> 25:33.040
Yeah.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.000
That's about it.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.760
I will say this.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.760
I express surprise

25:38.560 --> 25:41.360
that the owner of a basketball arena

25:42.000 --> 25:43.600
would allow donkeys in it.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.920
I feel like that would be a thing

25:45.920 --> 25:46.720
where they would be like,

25:46.720 --> 25:48.560
that will destroy the floors

25:48.560 --> 25:50.400
and they'll probably poop everywhere.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.160
I'm not positive

25:52.160 --> 25:54.160
that you would definitely need to do it

25:54.160 --> 25:57.120
on like a regulation.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.600
Oh, you're talking about that donkey street ball.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.800
Oh, so like and one donkey.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.560
Donkey two, take it to the streets.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.280
You've forgotten your roots, donkey.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.240
You gotta go back.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.480
I can't go back.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.040
I'm too big time now.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.040
After I got my contract with Nike

26:16.880 --> 26:18.400
and I signed a powder raid deal

26:18.400 --> 26:20.240
that was really disadvantageous.

26:20.240 --> 26:24.240
I should have read the contract.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.320
If only I had a big time lawyer in the city

26:26.320 --> 26:28.000
to get me out of the contract.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.400
Lawyer half a donkey.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.480
You forgot your roots in the big city.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.720
You gotta go back to street law.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.440
You have to go back to courts in alleys

26:37.440 --> 26:38.560
and the judge's hair is made

26:38.560 --> 26:39.760
of torn up toilet paper.

26:41.120 --> 26:41.920
Wait, hold on.

26:41.920 --> 26:42.480
Wait, why would that?

26:42.480 --> 26:43.520
Oh, because of the wigs.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.600
I see there's no barristers wigs.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.680
Oh, this is in England.

26:47.680 --> 26:48.480
I meant to say.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.400
Don't jump right over the England setting

26:50.400 --> 26:51.520
and waste that in the sequel

26:51.520 --> 26:53.520
because that could be the third flick right there.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.640
That's donkey three.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.160
Her Majesty's secret donkey.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.760
Also, he becomes a secret agent.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.440
Yeah, well, yeah, naturally.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.040
Basketball is the front to get him

27:07.040 --> 27:08.640
into the Russian headquarters.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.040
Listen, if you transfer an American film franchise

27:11.040 --> 27:13.840
to the UK, there's gonna be spies

27:13.840 --> 27:14.960
and shit up in it.

27:14.960 --> 27:15.760
That's a guarantee.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.960
We've found out that we've tracked down

27:18.960 --> 27:20.160
this Colombian drug lord.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.560
He's been hiding out in Wales

27:22.560 --> 27:25.920
and he's using mules to sneak drugs

27:25.920 --> 27:27.280
across the border.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.880
And the donkey's like,

27:28.880 --> 27:30.080
that sounds like a job for me.

27:30.080 --> 27:30.640
I'm already there.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.160
He's already out the door

27:32.160 --> 27:32.960
before they're talking.

27:32.960 --> 27:33.760
Tell him like, you know,

27:33.760 --> 27:34.800
it's metaphorical mules,

27:34.800 --> 27:36.000
but okay, donkey.

27:36.640 --> 27:37.200
Do your best.

27:37.760 --> 27:38.720
Dunktastic.

27:40.000 --> 27:40.960
I had something I wanted to say.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.600
I've forgotten.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.480
Was there something about donkey?

27:44.480 --> 27:45.680
Because it's the only thing

27:45.680 --> 27:46.720
I care about anymore.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.160
I remember it was in the sequel,

27:50.160 --> 27:52.400
Donkey 2, dunking it to the streets.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.200
Uh-huh.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.400
Can we get, now, bear with me here.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.480
Okay, bears?

27:58.480 --> 27:58.960
Yes.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.120
No.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.320
Okay.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.960
A sexy female donkey,

28:02.960 --> 28:05.920
kind of like Lola from Space Jam,

28:05.920 --> 28:08.000
who did it for a lot of people.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.440
Who shall remain nameless.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.720
Who will not be named on this show.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.280
But can we get a sexy female donkey

28:15.280 --> 28:16.640
and maybe she's a little bit

28:16.640 --> 28:18.080
more anthropomorphized?

28:18.720 --> 28:20.080
We need something for the fellas,

28:20.080 --> 28:21.040
because up till now,

28:21.040 --> 28:22.880
donkey's just been all for the ladies.

28:22.880 --> 28:23.360
Yeah.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.120
Super quick round robin.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.800
Who voices, what's her name?

28:28.800 --> 28:29.300
Lola?

28:30.080 --> 28:30.580
What?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.240
No, not Lola Griffin.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.560
Can you go five minutes of that time?

28:34.560 --> 28:35.520
Just five minutes.

28:35.520 --> 28:39.200
Griffin, can you go five minutes of that talking about Lola?

28:39.200 --> 28:41.200
I need a name for female donkey.

28:41.200 --> 28:41.920
Oh, oh, oh.

28:41.920 --> 28:42.720
Dunkina.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.440
Patricia Arquette.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.400
Dunkina is like,

28:44.400 --> 28:45.280
Patricia Arquette?

28:45.280 --> 28:48.080
Well, Dunkina's name can't be Patricia Arquette, Griffin.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.160
You're gonna ask it for a while.

28:50.160 --> 28:50.880
I'm so sorry.

28:51.680 --> 28:55.440
Patricia Arquette is going to voice Dunkachino,

28:55.440 --> 28:58.400
because, and she's Italian.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.600
She's Italian, and we all know

28:59.600 --> 29:00.960
Patricia Arquette can do Italian.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.240
Oh, fuck that.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.160
Then I'm getting Isabella Rossellini.

29:04.160 --> 29:04.720
Oh, nice.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.760
She's Dunkachino.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.040
She's everywhere right now.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.800
Everything has had Patricia Arquette in it.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.800
And where else are we gonna do it?

29:10.800 --> 29:13.360
You know, as the, as Dunkey's mom?

29:13.360 --> 29:15.360
No, that's just insulting.

29:15.360 --> 29:18.480
I think she needs to have a more central role in the film.

29:19.040 --> 29:22.720
Could, could, could, could Patricia Arquette voice

29:23.600 --> 29:25.280
Dunkey's bird buddy.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.320
And that would be?

29:26.320 --> 29:27.840
Uh, Larry Bird.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.560
Oh, we've, no, we've lost it.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.160
Let's go to the mic.

29:34.160 --> 29:34.800
We had it.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.760
We had it.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.720
We had it for a bit there.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.680
But then we lost it.

29:37.680 --> 29:50.960
Patricia Arquette took it from us.

29:50.960 --> 29:54.800
The undies is dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear

29:54.800 --> 29:56.320
that's also fun to wear.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.000
I'm wearing some now.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.280
What is, describe them.

29:59.280 --> 30:04.400
Mmm, silky, smooth, comfort, snugness.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.320
I mean, no, they're really, they're really comfortable.

30:06.320 --> 30:10.240
I, I did laundry today because I was out of me undies.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.120
This is true.

30:11.120 --> 30:15.200
I just had terrible old underwear and I needed to replace them

30:15.200 --> 30:19.040
with something that's gonna like bring glory to my frame.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.320
And I did it with me undies.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.560
Now these aren't just for fellas.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.320
I know we're all three fellas here.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.720
But they just launched their All of Me women's collection.

30:26.720 --> 30:27.280
I'm a dog.

30:27.280 --> 30:27.920
It's a four piece.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.360
I'm a dog.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.040
It's a four piece line of undies designed specifically

30:33.040 --> 30:36.880
for the female body in all of its, should I say this?

30:36.880 --> 30:37.680
I'm gonna say it.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.640
Ain't all it's complex, gorgeous as hell glory.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.720
The real sufferers are the other two of us

30:42.720 --> 30:44.560
that had to listen to the third one say it.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.720
Somebody, somebody was gonna get burnt there.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.240
You know what I think, Justin?

30:48.240 --> 30:49.280
I'm just gonna say it.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.400
This is controversial.

30:50.400 --> 30:50.960
I know.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.000
I think women are great.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.600
Whoa.

30:53.600 --> 30:53.840
Yeah.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.480
I'm gonna lay it all out on the line.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.440
My main problem is referring to their bodies as complex.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.920
Because I think I've got it pretty well figured out.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.320
So ladies, if you can figure out.

31:17.280 --> 31:17.840
By now.

31:20.240 --> 31:23.360
If you can, ladies, if you can figure out a way

31:23.360 --> 31:28.960
to use your confusing body to access a website,

31:28.960 --> 31:30.880
slinging your limbs hither and yon.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.280
Your tendrils.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.480
Your tendrils.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.000
Your probisci.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.440
No.

32:09.440 --> 32:10.560

I think this is our second time having them on the show.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.240
But I'm just as excited as the first.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.120
It's SlipShot.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.080
Woo.

32:22.080 --> 32:22.560
Woo.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.720

worth of archives.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.840
That sentence got away from me.

32:51.840 --> 32:56.960
But now, Griffin, what if I think that this is a cool idea

32:56.960 --> 32:59.680
and I'd love to check it out, but it's important to me

32:59.680 --> 33:04.720
that the landing page was specific to a podcast I enjoy.

33:05.280 --> 33:08.800
You're talking about wanting to see in the same web page

33:08.800 --> 33:15.120
The Three of Us, nudity, sexual intercourse

33:15.120 --> 33:17.520
between two illustrated beauties,

33:17.520 --> 33:24.640
some penises, some breasts and vaginas,

33:24.640 --> 33:26.640
and also The Three of Us are there.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.520
And also some vore.

33:27.520 --> 33:28.560
And a little bit of vore.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.360
Is that something they could provide for me?

33:31.360 --> 33:33.200
Yeah, I think we can do that for you.

33:33.200 --> 33:36.160
It's slipshine.net slash mbmbam.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.720
What are you guys into?

33:38.720 --> 33:40.480
Well, I have this podcast I listen to.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.480
I'm also into sexual intercourse

33:42.480 --> 33:45.200
between two consenting characters in a comic.

33:46.000 --> 33:46.640
Radical.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.680
We got you.

33:47.680 --> 33:48.480
Maybe more.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.320
I bet I have not read all 10 years of the Slipshine Archives.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.520
I am betting that at some point more than two partners

33:55.520 --> 33:56.560
are involved in sexual intercourse.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.000
No, it's just two people.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.640
Their names are Marcus and Danielle.

34:01.760 --> 34:06.000
That is the one area in which Slipshine is not sex positive

34:06.000 --> 34:08.320
is that it has to be two married adults.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.280
That's the only thing about it that's different.

34:11.280 --> 34:11.600
No, no, they got it.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.040
And they don't make eye contact

34:13.040 --> 34:14.160
and they do it with the lights off.

34:14.160 --> 34:14.480
They got it.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.200
slipshine.net slash mbmbam.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.560
There's no first time sign up fee

34:18.560 --> 34:21.120
and you get a 10% discount on six month

34:21.120 --> 34:22.800
and yearly subscriptions.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.680
They got a fresh content monthly in 10 years.

34:25.680 --> 34:28.400
A decade of sexy, sexy archives.

34:29.040 --> 34:29.280
Go.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.480
I have a message here for Max A

34:32.480 --> 34:36.240
and it's from electricity and magnetism, really.

34:38.080 --> 34:43.840
And these two inscrutable primal forces of the universe

34:43.840 --> 34:45.600
say to their buddy, Max A,

34:46.320 --> 34:51.280
in my opinion, a better prank would be a mbmbam jumbotron spot

34:51.280 --> 34:53.600
calling you out for planting a creepy picture

34:53.600 --> 34:56.160
of my sister's doppelganger in her room.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.000
It's also significantly more expensive,

34:58.000 --> 34:59.280
but this is America.

34:59.280 --> 35:02.720
So the people decide who the ultimate prankster really is.

35:02.720 --> 35:05.120
Either way, this past year has been the best.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.000
Love you always.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.960
Man, Max is in good

35:08.960 --> 35:12.720
with these two inscrutable primal forces of the universe.

35:12.720 --> 35:16.400
Do you think he has control over magnetism and electricity?

35:16.400 --> 35:19.120
Like he can like shoot thunder waves and stuff out of his-

35:19.120 --> 35:20.800
I think he's probably a Pikachu.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.360
I think he's just well acquainted with them.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.560
I have another message.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.680
This is fantastic.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.920
This is for future Scott.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.640
But honestly, by the time you're reading that,

35:30.640 --> 35:33.840
I mean, in the exact moment that is now,

35:33.840 --> 35:36.400
it's for present Scott, I would assume, right?

35:36.400 --> 35:38.400
It was written for future Scott.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.560
It's being delivered to present Scott

35:40.560 --> 35:43.120
and it is from past Scott.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.680
And the message is, you're doing fine.

35:45.680 --> 35:46.240
Keep it up.

35:47.280 --> 35:47.780
Heart.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.640
There's like a less than three.

35:51.360 --> 35:51.760
He didn't-

35:51.760 --> 35:51.920
Yeah.

35:51.920 --> 35:52.480
He wasn't talking.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.120
Picture of a heart.

35:53.120 --> 35:53.840
Hey, keep it up.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.400
And also keep listening to the band Heart.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.360
This is terrific.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.400
Man, I hope-

36:00.400 --> 36:02.800
Keep supporting the wrestler, Brett the Hitman heart.

36:04.000 --> 36:04.960
I hope this paid off.

36:04.960 --> 36:05.920
It probably did, right?

36:06.640 --> 36:10.400
I think right now past Scott is like, I think I did it.

36:10.400 --> 36:14.160
Now past Scott can die quietly so that future Scott may live.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.240
When did he throw this brick up?

36:16.240 --> 36:18.960
When do you think he put this shot up in the air?

36:18.960 --> 36:20.240
Let me check the email real quick.

36:20.960 --> 36:21.460
What?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.920
1916.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.640
But that means-

36:26.160 --> 36:27.920
I was wondering why this Jumbotron spot

36:27.920 --> 36:29.920
was delivered by Western Union Telegram.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.520
He made it.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.800
He's alive.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.520
Did the weeping angels get him?

36:37.520 --> 36:38.880
Is that what's going on?

36:38.880 --> 36:39.520
Telegram.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.080
Telegram.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.360
It says you're doing fine.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.160
Keep it up.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.560
And don't forget to steal your dad's car keys.

36:44.560 --> 36:45.200
That's weird.

36:45.200 --> 36:45.680
That's weird.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.120
Garbage can.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.400
Garbage can.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.440
Also don't blink.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.880
Oh, hey there everybody.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.600
I'm Guy Branham and welcome to Pop Rocket,

36:55.600 --> 36:58.960
a new weekly show picking over the pop culture we all love to love.

36:59.520 --> 37:03.200
With me to talk TV, film, music, and anything else entertaining

37:03.200 --> 37:07.840
are journalist Margaret Wappler, academic writer and DJ Oliver Wang,

37:07.840 --> 37:11.520
digital strategist Winona Mitchell, and comedian Santina Muha.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.760
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark-filled discussion

37:13.760 --> 37:16.960
about pop culture by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.000
No name calling, no rudeness, just straight talk and a lot of role play.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.600
I'm only 30-something for another year.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.480
Me too.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.040
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.040
Pop Rocket comes out every week from MaximumFun.org.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.720
My wife is a therapist with a master's degree

37:34.720 --> 37:37.760
and I have a useless degree in illustration.

37:37.760 --> 37:38.720
Work is not...

37:38.720 --> 37:40.800
That is not my editorialization, by the way.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.360
I think illustration degrees are great, I bet.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.120
Work is not so plentiful in Indiana,

37:45.120 --> 37:47.760
so I'm working as an educational assistant

37:47.760 --> 37:49.760
and doing a minimum wage summer job.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.720
I'm on the track to getting a better degree right now,

37:52.720 --> 37:55.920
but in the meantime, I can't help but feel a little less than equal with her.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.280
She's amazingly supportive.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.240
The problem isn't with her.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.680
I know traditional gender roles are bullshit,

38:01.680 --> 38:04.960
but I can't seem to feel okay making so much less,

38:04.960 --> 38:06.880
especially when we got student loans out the ass.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.200
And I stopped worrying about this.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.200
That's from Tragically Traditional Teacher,

38:11.200 --> 38:12.320
pending licensure,

38:12.320 --> 38:14.800
and I've got the solution you've been waiting for.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.440
Are you ready?

38:16.000 --> 38:16.320
Yes.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.880
Make more money.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.120
Okay.

38:19.680 --> 38:20.400
Okay?

38:20.400 --> 38:21.280
Wait, now think.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.840
Take the idea you heard from us about Dunkey,

38:25.840 --> 38:27.280
turn it into a spec script.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.360
You go to LA, you sell it for a million dollars.

38:29.360 --> 38:29.760
What's that?

38:29.760 --> 38:30.080
Story.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.040
New Steven Soderbergh?

38:31.040 --> 38:31.680
I should think so.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.000
Storyboard it with your illustration skills.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.880
Storyboard Dunkey with your illustration skills.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.240
Maybe it's an animated movie.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.960
You know, the thing is,

38:40.960 --> 38:42.800
when you're in a partnership with somebody,

38:42.800 --> 38:44.720
I mean, maybe you're married,

38:44.720 --> 38:46.720
maybe you're just a, you know,

38:46.720 --> 38:48.800
are in a committed relationship, whatever.

38:48.800 --> 38:51.840
The biggest, most important thing you can do is

38:54.160 --> 38:55.520
in areas like this,

38:55.520 --> 38:57.520
not, this is not all encompassing,

38:57.520 --> 38:59.280
but like in areas like this, especially,

38:59.280 --> 39:02.000
where it's just about the business of,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.280
of like progressing in life,

39:05.280 --> 39:06.640
the business end of life,

39:06.640 --> 39:09.120
rather than the rest of it.

39:09.120 --> 39:09.360
Pleasure.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.640
I think it's really important

39:10.640 --> 39:15.200
to stop seeing two individual people here

39:15.200 --> 39:19.840
and really legitimately start seeing a team.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.840
So if the two of you are getting by

39:23.840 --> 39:25.120
and you're figuring it out

39:25.120 --> 39:27.040
and you're, you know,

39:27.040 --> 39:28.800
you have what you need to make ends meet

39:30.160 --> 39:31.360
and you have enough money,

39:31.360 --> 39:34.240
like to get through the day and what have you,

39:34.240 --> 39:37.440
I don't think that you should feel like guilt necessarily

39:37.440 --> 39:38.480
that you are not,

39:38.480 --> 39:42.400
there's not as many like zeros on your paycheck.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.640
Like, I think that's a destructive way

39:44.640 --> 39:45.520
of looking at things

39:45.520 --> 39:48.000
because if you think of the situation more inverse,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.440
if you were making more money than her,

39:49.440 --> 39:52.160
you wouldn't want her to, you know,

39:53.040 --> 39:54.160
beat herself up this way.

39:54.160 --> 39:56.160
There's also countless other things

39:56.160 --> 39:58.800
that you provide that have nothing to do

39:58.800 --> 40:00.720
with the financials of the relationship.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.440
Stuff like support and being there for each other,

40:03.440 --> 40:07.680
you know, so money is not the only factor.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.840
It's not the only thing anyone can contribute

40:09.840 --> 40:11.840
and you could drive yourself crazy

40:11.840 --> 40:15.360
and ruin all of those other aspects of the relationship

40:15.360 --> 40:18.960
because you become so focused on this idea of equality

40:18.960 --> 40:19.440
wherein-

40:21.040 --> 40:22.960
Not just equality, Trev, financial equality.

40:22.960 --> 40:23.600
Yeah, financial equality.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.080
I think that's the pit that you fall into.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.560
When I married my wife,

40:28.560 --> 40:30.000
she was in medical school

40:30.000 --> 40:35.200
and I was, I think, working at the newspaper.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.080
But either way,

40:36.080 --> 40:38.160
I knew that I was not gonna do anything

40:38.720 --> 40:42.000
with my sort of professional existence

40:42.000 --> 40:44.720
that would be in any way helpful

40:44.720 --> 40:48.400
to Earth and people and stuff in the way that my wife is.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.480
So I made the decision when we got married

40:50.480 --> 40:51.840
that, okay, what I'm gonna do,

40:51.840 --> 40:53.440
the most important thing I'm gonna do

40:54.160 --> 40:58.000
is support her so she can do actual real things

40:58.000 --> 41:00.880
that are helpful to Earth.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.320
And I knew I wasn't actually gonna be able

41:02.320 --> 41:03.840
to come up with her financially either.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.280
So it's like kind of a double whammy,

41:05.280 --> 41:09.040
but I knew that my highest and best use

41:09.040 --> 41:11.520
was supporting her so she could do that stuff.

41:11.520 --> 41:15.600
So if you're looking for self-worth

41:16.480 --> 41:18.720
and to feel justified in a relationship,

41:18.720 --> 41:20.720
if you're looking for that from a paycheck,

41:20.720 --> 41:22.240
you're always gonna be disappointed.

41:22.240 --> 41:22.640
I agree.

41:22.640 --> 41:27.840
Focus more on what you are bringing to the team

41:27.840 --> 41:31.040
and if you are contributing in ways

41:31.040 --> 41:32.160
that aren't just monetary.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.600
Because honestly, when it boils down to it,

41:33.600 --> 41:38.320
that's one of the, that's not the be-all end-all solution.

41:38.320 --> 41:38.800
I agree.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.360
Yeah, I mean, do that.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.400
Don't worry about it anymore.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.360
But you're free.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.160
You're free.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.240
We freed you from your anxiety.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.040
Fly away.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.400
You guys wanna Yahoo?

41:48.400 --> 41:48.900
Yes.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.520
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.280
And before I read it,

41:53.280 --> 41:57.680
I wanna read another one that Drew Davenport sent in.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.640
Let me actually find the email

41:58.640 --> 41:59.280
because it's really great.

41:59.280 --> 41:59.760
Hold on.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.040
God, it's like Inception.

42:01.040 --> 42:04.000
To understand, you must first understand

42:04.000 --> 42:05.760
the first Drew Davenport.

42:05.760 --> 42:08.560
But which layer of Drew Davenport are you on now?

42:08.560 --> 42:11.280
I'm still trying to close this Slipshine landing page,

42:11.280 --> 42:12.800
but it is horny and a half.

42:12.800 --> 42:13.520
Yeah, it's tough.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.760
It just keeps popping up

42:15.760 --> 42:17.840
and I'm not talking about the webpage.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.600
Drew Davenport sent this in.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.960
I mean Martinez.

42:20.960 --> 42:21.680
Right, right, right.

42:21.680 --> 42:23.680
Drew Davenport sent this email in.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.720
Because it's becoming a rest.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.200
Travis.

42:27.120 --> 42:28.640
Drew Davenport sent this email in.

42:29.440 --> 42:30.000
And he said,

42:30.000 --> 42:30.880
Dear brothers,

42:30.880 --> 42:31.920
look at what my meddling

42:31.920 --> 42:33.840
in the Yahoo Answers service has wrought.

42:34.480 --> 42:38.400
And he sent in a link to a Yahoo asked by Panda Pants,

42:38.400 --> 42:39.040
who asked,

42:39.040 --> 42:40.320
this past February,

42:41.360 --> 42:45.280
how can I have sex with Drew Davenport?

42:46.720 --> 42:47.200
What?

42:47.200 --> 42:47.520
What?

42:47.520 --> 42:50.560
And then someone with the Yahoo Answers name, C,

42:50.560 --> 42:51.600
responded,

42:51.600 --> 42:54.320
insert his pins in your vagina.

42:55.280 --> 42:55.780
What?

42:57.280 --> 42:57.780
Jeez.

42:57.780 --> 43:00.880
So them probably not getting the reference.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.120
Clearly not.

43:03.120 --> 43:05.440
Or understanding how to spell the word penis,

43:05.440 --> 43:08.640
or completely misunderstanding how the sexual act works.

43:08.640 --> 43:13.520
Or completely understanding that Drew Davenport

43:13.520 --> 43:15.200
just has a bunch of pins down there.

43:15.200 --> 43:19.120
Just has a bunch of pins down there.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.240
Bound together.

43:21.440 --> 43:24.560
It's like the bottom of an NES cartridge down there.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.600
It's just a strip of different connectors.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.400
No, I was thinking more like writing pens.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.240
But they're all like,

43:32.240 --> 43:35.280
it's like 14 bic pens.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.560
And they're all bound together

43:36.560 --> 43:39.360
with like a braces bracket rubber band thing.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.440
And only three of them have ink left in them.

43:41.440 --> 43:42.320
Oh, Travis.

43:42.320 --> 43:46.720
He's a virile, virile young man.

43:46.720 --> 43:49.280
Okay, then three of the 14 don't have ink in them.

43:49.280 --> 43:50.960
But that leaves 11 that do.

43:51.520 --> 43:52.960
And if you push down on the top of them,

43:52.960 --> 43:54.800
it goes from red to blue to black.

43:54.800 --> 43:55.680
I like that.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.920
Anyway, I really love that this person

43:57.920 --> 44:01.440
just put a message in the metaphorical bottle.

44:01.440 --> 44:04.160
Just sent it out hoping that it would land on Drew Davenport.

44:04.160 --> 44:04.560
And it did.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.680
It was snagged in his dragnet.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.440
And now we've actually talked about it on the show,

44:11.440 --> 44:12.880
rewarding this behavior.

44:13.520 --> 44:15.280
Yeah, I'm all for that actually.

44:15.280 --> 44:18.480
If you want to keep dropping these sexual landmines

44:18.480 --> 44:21.600
into the vast ocean of Yahoo Answers

44:21.600 --> 44:23.680
and see if our buddy Drew Davenport picks it up.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.120
You have to be careful with that though.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.120
I've long worried about our interference

44:29.120 --> 44:31.200
with the Yahoo Answers ecosystem.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.520
I try to discourage that at every turn

44:33.520 --> 44:37.280
because it will get to a point where it's just Ouroboros.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.000
Like, so I got my question on the bim bam

44:40.000 --> 44:41.920
and then this is on the bim bam too.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.000
And then they're reading it and then they turn it into a clip

44:44.000 --> 44:46.160
and I'm going to ask it in a new Yahoo Answer service.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.040
You can't get off that train.

44:47.040 --> 44:47.600
Yeah, that's a good point.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.360
And then you end up in Finding Nemo 2.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.280
There's a scene of them fleeing through sharks

44:51.280 --> 44:54.240
and going through a whole field of sexual landmines.

44:54.240 --> 44:55.600
And it's just too dangerous.

44:55.600 --> 44:56.560
You know what I mean?

44:56.560 --> 44:57.040
No, I don't.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.080
It's called Finding Dory.

44:58.080 --> 44:58.880
It's actually coming out.

44:59.680 --> 45:00.080
Oh.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.200
Do you know that, Trev?

45:01.200 --> 45:01.760
I didn't know.

45:01.760 --> 45:02.640
Now I'm very excited about it.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.520
Hey, hey, hey.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.840
Did you all know that they're making a Finding Nemo 2?

45:07.360 --> 45:07.600
Hey.

45:07.600 --> 45:10.320
Hey, you guys have been listening to our podcast for a while.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.080
Did you know I'm making a Finding Nemo 2?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.640
I think it's bullshit that Finding Nemo 2,

45:18.640 --> 45:21.280
Finding Dory gets to be on the silver screen.

45:21.280 --> 45:24.640
But my script, Dunkey, is just sitting unread inside.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.680
Inside of your brain because you haven't pinned yet.

45:27.680 --> 45:28.800
Unread and unwritten.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.880
This was another Yahoo sent in by Drew Davenport though.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.480
Francis Ford Coppola's Nestor.

45:34.480 --> 45:35.680
That's what I was trying to pull.

45:35.680 --> 45:36.160
Sorry.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user ABC who asks,

45:39.440 --> 45:42.800
if you could make a new custom flag for America,

45:42.800 --> 45:44.240
what would the flag look like?

45:44.240 --> 45:46.320
Can you describe it or draw a picture of it?

45:47.760 --> 45:50.640
A little arts and crafts challenge for my two brothers.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.680
Okay, new flag for America.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.160
New flag.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.200
Throw this old one out.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.640
We want more states so badly.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.400
Oh man, do we want more states.

46:02.400 --> 46:05.840
But we can't get them because then we got to do a new flag.

46:05.840 --> 46:07.040
And it's going to look ridiculous.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.160
51 stars.

46:08.160 --> 46:10.400
That would actually be my new design by the way.

46:11.200 --> 46:14.880
I would make it 51 stars and then just show it

46:14.880 --> 46:16.320
to like neighboring nations.

46:16.320 --> 46:17.200
Like, hey.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.560
Hey, Canada, Puerto Rico.

46:18.560 --> 46:19.920
Hey, Canada, Puerto Rico.

46:19.920 --> 46:21.680
Got a spot for you right here.

46:21.680 --> 46:25.760
Or when we go and occupy a country for some reason,

46:26.400 --> 46:28.640
then we can be like, you sure you won't mess with us?

46:28.640 --> 46:29.680
Because we hungry.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.480
Oh man, we hungry.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.920
Gonna eat your nation up.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.280
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.400
I would use a special dye that would allow the colors to run.

46:38.960 --> 46:39.520
Travis.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.520
These colors are very vulnerable to the elements.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.760
A lot of shitty bumper stickers would have to be

46:45.760 --> 46:48.080
gouged on off of a lot of shitty cars.

46:48.080 --> 46:50.880
But I would, to be fair, I would make it so that they would

46:50.880 --> 46:53.280
only run in very specific circumstances.

46:53.280 --> 46:57.840
Like if it rained and the temperature was above like 97 degrees.

46:57.840 --> 46:58.080
Okay.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.960
Right, so that that way we can make bumper stickers that said

47:00.960 --> 47:04.480
these colors do not normally run.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.360
But given the right set of circumstances,

47:07.360 --> 47:09.360
we have that option should we choose it.

47:11.040 --> 47:11.840
How about this?

47:13.680 --> 47:20.240
Calvin peeing on a pile of every other country's flags.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.120
That's pretty good.

47:22.320 --> 47:25.920
And then kneeling respectfully before a pile of every other

47:25.920 --> 47:27.040
nation's flag soaked in.

47:27.040 --> 47:35.440
How about Bart Simpson and Calvin peeing into each other?

47:37.520 --> 47:43.840
Wait, like in a circular kind of infinity thing?

47:43.840 --> 47:46.480
Following the Fibonacci sequence.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.200
A mobius strip of peeing.

47:49.920 --> 47:52.720
Underneath it, it says America 2 in Comic Sans.

47:52.720 --> 47:52.960
Yeah.

47:53.920 --> 47:54.800
To the Bart man.

47:54.800 --> 48:05.440
This is a subtitle for America 2 to the Bart man.

48:05.440 --> 48:10.000
The UN recognizes the delegate from America 2 to the Bart man.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.440
Thank you, ghost of Kofi Annan.

48:17.440 --> 48:21.280
What I'm here to do is announce a bold new feature for our country,

48:21.280 --> 48:25.440
which is now called America 2 to the Bart man.

48:25.440 --> 48:28.720
I have these words of wisdom for the delegates from Iraq.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.000
Don't have a cow, man.

48:31.680 --> 48:36.720
What would we do with the old flags in America 2 to the Bart man?

48:36.720 --> 48:41.440
They would only be used for boxers to wear as capes as they entered the ring.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.960
We got all these flags lying around.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.640
We could give them to the less fortunate.

48:46.640 --> 48:51.840
At the end of the day, we have all these flags lying around.

48:51.840 --> 49:00.240
I mean, if dumb-dumbs who are especially enthused about Confederate history are any example,

49:00.240 --> 49:01.920
you just keep using them.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.040
You don't even need to worry about it.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.120
You just keep on using them.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.640
Children, gather around.

49:06.640 --> 49:12.000
Now, child citizens of America 2 colon to the Bart man.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.360
This is what a flag looked like over 50 years ago.

49:15.360 --> 49:19.600
Oh, but teacher, that flag is not extreme or sassy at all.

49:19.600 --> 49:20.480
No, it is not.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.920
That's why it was scrapped.

49:21.920 --> 49:25.920
Also, there's 50 stars on it, and we have 78 states.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.200
I'm confused.

49:27.200 --> 49:31.120
What would you see before we ate Africa?

49:31.120 --> 49:36.960
The new dollar bill should have a picture of a pyramid with Stewie's head floating above it.

49:36.960 --> 49:41.280
I think that would be great, but we only have singles because it's America 2,

49:41.280 --> 49:43.040
so we have a lot more strip clubs.

49:43.040 --> 49:45.760
I can't wait for that glorious day.

49:46.720 --> 49:50.240
What would our new national anthem be in America 2?

49:53.200 --> 49:54.720
Don't say Do the Bart Man.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.220
Okay.

49:55.920 --> 49:58.720
And don't say Deep, Deep Trouble, the B side of Do the Bart Man.

49:58.720 --> 50:01.520
Oh my god, I cannot believe that poll.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.200
How about Simpson sing the blues the entire album?

50:08.080 --> 50:10.240
Listen, don't get to the baseball game on time.

50:10.240 --> 50:16.080
You will be treated to 48 minutes of songs about the Simpsons.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.480
Just listen.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.520
I'm gonna get there.

50:19.520 --> 50:21.200
No, I'm gonna get there.

50:21.200 --> 50:22.000
I'm sitting outside.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.680
I'm gonna keep tailgating.

50:23.680 --> 50:27.200
When you hear Mr. Burns saying, look at all these idiots,

50:27.200 --> 50:29.840
we're about one track from the end of the record,

50:29.840 --> 50:33.520
so just go ahead and call me then, and I'll go ahead and come up.

50:33.520 --> 50:33.840
All right.

50:33.840 --> 50:35.040
Cowabunga, brother.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.880
Cowabunga's here.

50:36.880 --> 50:37.680
All hail Bart.

50:37.680 --> 50:42.000
Guys, guys, I hear Raoul coming.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.680
Okay, listen, we gotta wrap.

50:43.680 --> 50:44.560
Raoul's coming back.

50:45.120 --> 50:47.840
Just a few more housekeeping things to wrap up.

50:49.040 --> 50:50.320
We haven't mentioned for a little bit,

50:50.320 --> 50:55.840
but we've got some fun stuff for sale in the Max Fun Store.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.600
That's maxfunstore.com.

50:58.480 --> 51:04.560
If you missed out on the one cool thing is the tour poster

51:04.560 --> 51:08.880
for our Midwest shows designed by Justin Gray.

51:08.880 --> 51:09.760
They are really cool.

51:09.760 --> 51:11.200
They have secret codes on them.

51:11.200 --> 51:14.560
You can buy them for 15 bucks at maxfunstore.com,

51:14.560 --> 51:16.080
and you can choose which city you want.

51:16.080 --> 51:17.920
There's one more for Chicago.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.200
If you want that one, you should.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.160
There are not a lot of,

51:20.160 --> 51:23.440
these are the posters that we didn't get rid of at the live shows.

51:23.440 --> 51:25.680
So there's not a lot of them, but they're really cool.

51:26.240 --> 51:30.000
And they're relics, I would say, I guess.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.440
Relics of our freedom.

51:31.440 --> 51:31.940
Yeah.

51:31.940 --> 51:34.420
And I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

51:34.420 --> 51:35.300
for the use of our theme song.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.540
It's a departure off the album Plane of the Days to Bed.

51:37.540 --> 51:39.380
We're going to be hanging out with John Roderick here

51:39.380 --> 51:42.020
in a couple of weeks at Max Fun Con.

51:42.020 --> 51:43.540
I'm really, really excited for that.

51:43.540 --> 51:48.980
And I'm really excited for him to win his Seattle City Council run.

51:50.180 --> 51:52.260
Yeah, he's running for city council in Seattle.

51:52.260 --> 51:53.460
I know we've talked about it before,

51:53.460 --> 51:55.060
and I'm sure you all know about it by now.

51:55.060 --> 51:56.420
But if you live in Seattle,

51:57.780 --> 51:59.940
you should probably vote for John Roderick.

51:59.940 --> 52:01.540
Well, learn about his platform.

52:01.540 --> 52:03.060
Well, learn about his platform.

52:03.060 --> 52:04.580
You know, you don't want to rush in anything.

52:04.580 --> 52:06.180
Go to voteroderick.com.

52:06.180 --> 52:09.540
That's R-O-D-E-R-I-C-K.com.

52:09.540 --> 52:10.820
Check out his platform.

52:10.820 --> 52:14.020
See sort of if he aligns with your own viewpoint.

52:14.020 --> 52:14.740
I bet he does.

52:14.740 --> 52:15.700
He's awesome.

52:15.700 --> 52:17.140
He wrote our theme song.

52:17.140 --> 52:18.740
So how bad could he be?

52:18.740 --> 52:22.020
How bad could his ideas about bills and tariffs really be?

52:22.020 --> 52:23.700
Do they still do tariffs?

52:23.700 --> 52:24.740
Not in America, too.

52:25.300 --> 52:26.420
Oh, that's good to hear.

52:27.300 --> 52:30.660
We've got a couple of live shows coming up at the end of August.

52:30.660 --> 52:31.620
We're doing three.

52:32.180 --> 52:35.060
One in Portland, one in Seattle, one in Vancouver.

52:35.060 --> 52:36.500
The Portland show is already sold out,

52:36.500 --> 52:38.980
but you can get tickets for the Seattle and Vancouver shows

52:38.980 --> 52:42.420
at bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Seattle

52:42.420 --> 52:46.260
and bit.ly forward slash van M-B-M-B-A-M.

52:48.260 --> 52:49.860
There's a new podcast you might like

52:49.860 --> 52:54.100
that Travis makes with his friend, a musician,

52:54.100 --> 52:56.500
and YouTube superstar, Brent O'Floss.

52:56.500 --> 52:57.700
It's called Trends Like These.

52:57.700 --> 53:00.340
And you can find it on iTunes.

53:00.340 --> 53:02.580
And you go there, and you search for it, and you download it.

53:02.580 --> 53:05.220
And it's about what's happening on the internet.

53:05.220 --> 53:07.700
And it's a really funny show, and I enjoy it very much.

53:07.700 --> 53:09.540
And you can go get it.

53:09.540 --> 53:13.060
You can also, there's a brand new viral video series

53:13.060 --> 53:16.660
that I just cannot get enough of called Things I Bought at Sheets

53:16.660 --> 53:20.180
starring our own Justin McElroy and his friend Dwight Slappy.

53:20.180 --> 53:25.060
And Justin stops at Sheets, buys something, eats it,

53:25.060 --> 53:29.700
and then Dwight guesses what his review of that item will be.

53:29.700 --> 53:32.660
And here's the thing, you guys, take some twists and turns.

53:32.660 --> 53:33.940
You're never gonna see it coming.

53:33.940 --> 53:35.060
You gotta go check it out.

53:35.060 --> 53:36.260
Just wrapped season one.

53:37.380 --> 53:38.820
I really wanted to make a season two,

53:38.820 --> 53:40.580
and the only way they're gonna do that is with your support.

53:40.580 --> 53:43.860
So go to YouTube and search Things I Bought at Sheets with a Z.

53:44.660 --> 53:47.380
And I'm still working on my video series

53:47.380 --> 53:52.020
where I use my bare feet and I step on desserts.

53:53.380 --> 53:53.860
And then people-

53:53.860 --> 53:55.140
What's that called?

53:56.180 --> 53:56.900
Smush shoes.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.020
Smush shoes.

53:58.020 --> 54:00.180
Smush shoes, the Griffin McElroy story.

54:00.180 --> 54:01.940
Sorry, Justin, I was checking my texts.

54:01.940 --> 54:03.380
I'm glad you jumped in there for me.

54:04.580 --> 54:06.260
It's called smushy shoes, Trapp.

54:06.260 --> 54:07.700
And it's just me stepping on desserts,

54:07.700 --> 54:09.140
and every week it's a new dessert.

54:09.140 --> 54:10.020
Did I say week?

54:10.020 --> 54:11.220
I meant hour.

54:11.220 --> 54:12.180
It's an hourly show.

54:12.820 --> 54:14.500
It's an hourly video show.

54:14.500 --> 54:16.100
We also want to encourage you to check out

54:16.100 --> 54:18.740
all the other amazing Max Fun podcasts.

54:18.740 --> 54:19.620
There's a ton.

54:19.620 --> 54:21.140
The one I want to talk about right now

54:21.140 --> 54:23.700
is the Flop House just did a Mordecai episode

54:23.700 --> 54:24.980
that made me so happy.

54:24.980 --> 54:29.220
And their opinions of it were very surprising.

54:29.220 --> 54:32.020
And now I might actually have to watch Mordecai.

54:32.020 --> 54:33.220
No, no, no, no, no.

54:33.220 --> 54:33.700
Listen.

54:33.700 --> 54:35.620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

54:35.620 --> 54:38.340
I might live stream me watching Mordecai

54:38.340 --> 54:40.340
so you could watch me watch Mordecai.

54:40.340 --> 54:41.940
That'd be highly illegal, first of all.

54:42.500 --> 54:43.940
No, you don't get to watch Mordecai.

54:43.940 --> 54:46.020
You just see my face as I watch Mordecai.

54:46.020 --> 54:47.540
How about a final yahoo?

54:47.540 --> 54:49.140
Well, go listen to the Flop House.

54:49.140 --> 54:51.700
Okay, well, right now and then we can close the show?

54:51.700 --> 54:52.420
Yeah, yeah.

54:52.420 --> 54:54.340
Okay, one hour later.

54:54.340 --> 54:56.580
Man, that was a great podcast.

54:56.580 --> 54:56.900
I love it so much.

54:56.900 --> 54:58.660
There's still 45 minutes left.

54:58.660 --> 54:59.140
Oh, no.

55:00.420 --> 55:02.420
This is sent in again by Drew Davenport.

55:02.420 --> 55:03.460
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

55:04.420 --> 55:07.860
It's by yahoo answers user Vincent.

55:08.580 --> 55:09.940
And it's a little bit out there.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.380
It's not going to make a lot of sense,

55:11.380 --> 55:13.860
but just picture it in your mind.

55:16.740 --> 55:17.700
Vincent asks,

55:17.700 --> 55:24.340
Did Shia LaBeouf get his scream from John Turturro?

55:27.780 --> 55:29.380
I'm Justin McElroy.

55:31.060 --> 55:32.500
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.180
I'm Griffin McElroy, or Chaz.

55:34.180 --> 55:35.220
I'm Chaz, I'm Chaz, I'm Chaz, I'm Chaz.

55:35.220 --> 55:39.300
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

55:39.300 --> 55:49.460
He's your dad, square on the lips.

56:10.260 --> 56:12.180
that you need to seize today.

56:12.180 --> 56:13.700
You're a taxpayer, right?

56:13.700 --> 56:15.300
Well, then you've got it coming.

56:15.300 --> 56:16.580
Thanks to Uncle Sam.

56:16.580 --> 56:19.460
You can learn to get grants for education.

56:19.460 --> 56:20.820
Learn to ride a llama.

56:20.820 --> 56:23.380
Print money the old fashioned way.

56:23.380 --> 56:26.420
Force your dog to stop being so rambunctious.

56:26.420 --> 56:29.700
Make a souffle that sets and stays set.

56:29.700 --> 56:32.340
Mount the heads of your enemies on spikes.

56:32.340 --> 56:34.660
Grind your own corrective lenses

56:34.660 --> 56:37.300
using just rock salt and diamonds.

56:37.300 --> 56:40.660
For all of this and more, drop us a line.

56:40.660 --> 56:42.580
