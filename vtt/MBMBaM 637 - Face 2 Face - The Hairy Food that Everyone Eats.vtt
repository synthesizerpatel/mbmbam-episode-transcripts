WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
The McElroy brothers are not experts,

00:05.440 --> 00:09.120
and their advice should never be followed.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.040
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

00:13.440 --> 00:17.760
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.960
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only

00:20.960 --> 00:23.200
so the babies out there will know

00:23.200 --> 00:26.660
how cool they are for listening.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.660
What's up, you cool baby?

00:28.660 --> 00:32.660
It's the start of something beautiful.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.660
A small acquaintance has blossomed,

00:34.660 --> 00:38.660
it's ripened into a precious friendship.

00:38.660 --> 00:42.660
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

00:42.660 --> 00:46.660
Hangs at the skate park, hangs by the beach.

00:46.660 --> 00:50.660
My life, it feels like

00:50.660 --> 00:56.660
My life, it feels like

00:56.660 --> 01:02.660
Life, ah, it's better, it's better with you

01:02.660 --> 01:08.660
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you

01:08.660 --> 01:14.660
This is true, ah, it's better, it's better with two

01:14.660 --> 01:22.660
My life, ah, it's better with you

01:22.660 --> 01:24.660
This is my clear chair.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.660
Let's talk about the chairs for one second.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.660
We have, everyone agrees, the most visually boring show

01:29.660 --> 01:31.660
that you could possibly go see,

01:31.660 --> 01:35.660
and someone took the agency to give us some artistic chairs.

01:35.660 --> 01:36.660
This is a first.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.660
We have these beautiful clear chairs.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.660
They're beautiful, and it has spiced up the show visually.

01:41.660 --> 01:42.660
Hi, very welcome, my brother.

01:42.660 --> 01:44.660
My brother, me and my show for the modern era.

01:44.660 --> 01:46.660
I would say Cold Lucite.

01:46.660 --> 01:49.660
And I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:49.660 --> 01:56.660
And I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

01:56.660 --> 02:03.660
Et cetera.

02:03.660 --> 02:07.660
And I'm your sweet, were you really?

02:07.660 --> 02:15.660
Were you really about to start this show after your introduction?

02:15.660 --> 02:16.660
Feels on brand, doesn't it?

02:16.660 --> 02:18.660
It does a little bit.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.660
I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media,

02:20.660 --> 02:31.660
Luminary Griffin McElroy.

02:31.660 --> 02:33.660
Paul, help, I'm not on the wifi, Paul.

02:33.660 --> 02:34.660
You gotta help me.

02:34.660 --> 02:35.660
Can you help me?

02:35.660 --> 02:36.660
Help me, I'm not on the wifi, Travis.

02:36.660 --> 02:37.660
Help me, bud.

02:37.660 --> 02:41.660
I will admit, this is not the reception I was expecting.

02:41.660 --> 02:44.660
Yeah, let's take a second to talk about it.

02:44.660 --> 02:48.660
I would actually like to recognize our,

02:48.660 --> 02:51.660
if we could actually get house lights on,

02:51.660 --> 02:55.660
on the house lights, if those could come.

02:55.660 --> 02:56.660
Not the balcony, though.

02:56.660 --> 02:57.660
Not the balcony.

02:57.660 --> 02:58.660
Turn the balcony off.

02:58.660 --> 02:59.660
No, no, no, no, no.

02:59.660 --> 03:00.660
You need to know about the balcony.

03:00.660 --> 03:01.660
Yeah, it is them.

03:01.660 --> 03:04.660
Continue the sort of like Kevin McCallister tableau

03:04.660 --> 03:07.660
of human beings and the balcony sort of linked up

03:07.660 --> 03:09.660
by strings and pulleys.

03:09.660 --> 03:15.660
If you were at our previous Detroit show,

03:15.660 --> 03:20.660
I would like you to please stand and be recognized

03:20.660 --> 03:22.660
for your valor.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.660
You have all given so much for your country.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.660
This day of all days is important.

03:28.660 --> 03:30.660
Wait, is there lightsabers?

03:30.660 --> 03:33.660
Thank you, some lightsabers.

03:33.660 --> 03:35.660
People repping the Star Wars show.

03:35.660 --> 03:36.660
Bold.

03:36.660 --> 03:37.660
Bold.

03:37.660 --> 03:40.660
Okay, make them go away.

03:40.660 --> 03:41.660
We were talking.

03:41.660 --> 03:42.660
Bye.

03:42.660 --> 03:43.660
We were talking.

03:43.660 --> 03:44.660
Too scary.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.660
Keep going.

03:45.660 --> 03:46.660
No, no, no.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.660
Yeah.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.660
Yeah.

03:48.660 --> 03:50.660
See, we can send jokes out of the room for a second.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.660
This is about the same number we had at that show.

03:52.660 --> 03:56.660
I do think we have, I mean, I think you can say safely this way,

03:56.660 --> 04:00.660
we have demonstrably reduced our audience draw

04:00.660 --> 04:02.660
in the city of Detroit, Michigan.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.660
Oh, honey, they're coming again.

04:04.660 --> 04:05.660
Are we going to go see that show?

04:05.660 --> 04:07.660
Oh, yeah.

04:07.660 --> 04:13.660
Probably talk about Babylon 5 or some nerd shit, babe.

04:13.660 --> 04:15.660
And so perhaps never more applicable than it is now,

04:15.660 --> 04:21.660
like the Chilean miners, we've reemerged from that disaster

04:21.660 --> 04:23.660
to be here with you.

04:23.660 --> 04:24.660
Oh, maybe you're...

04:24.660 --> 04:25.660
I still think of that as a good day

04:25.660 --> 04:27.660
because I saw Endgame afterwards.

04:27.660 --> 04:28.660
Yeah.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.660
Or no, Infinity War.

04:29.660 --> 04:30.660
Infinity War.

04:30.660 --> 04:31.660
Yeah.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.660
No, I saw Endgame after eating too much

04:33.660 --> 04:35.660
at a Brazilian steakhouse.

04:35.660 --> 04:36.660
Okay.

04:36.660 --> 04:39.660
That's how I'll always remember it.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.660
What do you think of Endgame?

04:40.660 --> 04:42.660
Too full.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.660
If you're a new fan of ours,

04:44.660 --> 04:46.660
and maybe you don't know what we're talking about

04:46.660 --> 04:47.660
with all this Star Wars stuff,

04:47.660 --> 04:49.660
one time we came to Detroit to do a Star Wars show

04:49.660 --> 04:52.660
and it kicked so much ass.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.660
It was such a kickass show.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.660
We definitely didn't bail out super quick on the bit.

04:56.660 --> 04:57.660
Yeah.

04:57.660 --> 04:58.660
Yeah.

04:58.660 --> 04:59.660
Definitely one of us didn't bail out instantly

04:59.660 --> 05:02.660
for which the other two of us were actually pretty angry

05:02.660 --> 05:04.660
the next day.

05:04.660 --> 05:05.660
Travis.

05:05.660 --> 05:06.660
No, what?

05:06.660 --> 05:07.660
What?

05:07.660 --> 05:09.660
Yes, because I'm the one known for bailing

05:09.660 --> 05:10.660
on a not funny thing.

05:10.660 --> 05:12.660
It's been lost to history.

05:12.660 --> 05:13.660
We published that episode.

05:13.660 --> 05:16.660
Sorry, was my propensity for not doing things

05:16.660 --> 05:19.660
that aren't funny just used against me as a criticism?

05:19.660 --> 05:22.660
Justin, it was your original idea.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.660
It was your fucking idea, dude.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.660
You tweeted it without consulting anyone.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.660
Okay.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.660
What I'm saying is if the richest man in the world

05:30.660 --> 05:32.660
can do a dumb thing that he doesn't think through,

05:32.660 --> 05:34.660
I should be allowed to do it too, right?

05:34.660 --> 05:35.660
Thank you.

05:35.660 --> 05:38.660
Otherwise, it's classist.

05:38.660 --> 05:41.660
It's rich dad, poor dad, podcaster.

05:41.660 --> 05:43.660
You gotta have the mentality.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.660
We were talking about this backstage

05:45.660 --> 05:47.660
because that was also the first tour

05:47.660 --> 05:49.660
that our business manager, Amanda,

05:49.660 --> 05:52.660
who is really the backbone of this organization,

05:52.660 --> 05:54.660
went on with us, and so we were like,

05:54.660 --> 05:56.660
hey, welcome to the company.

05:56.660 --> 05:57.660
We blew it.

05:57.660 --> 06:00.660
We fucked up so bad.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.660
And we were talking about the next morning

06:02.660 --> 06:04.660
on our way to the airport, we took a Lyft,

06:04.660 --> 06:07.660
and it was like a sedan.

06:07.660 --> 06:10.660
So it was like driver, Amanda, all three of us together

06:10.660 --> 06:12.660
like we were on a road trip with our parents.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.660
What the fuck was wrong with you last night?

06:14.660 --> 06:16.660
What was that?

06:16.660 --> 06:18.660
And after that show,

06:18.660 --> 06:20.660
we changed the way we did live shows forever.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.660
We changed the format.

06:22.660 --> 06:23.660
No more themes.

06:23.660 --> 06:25.660
You know, we're having fun now,

06:25.660 --> 06:27.660
but I do not wish on any of you

06:27.660 --> 06:30.660
the feeling of sitting in front of 2,000 friends

06:30.660 --> 06:33.660
and realize you're dying.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.660
You're dying, and there's no force on earth

06:36.660 --> 06:38.660
that is gonna make that timer go any quicker.

06:38.660 --> 06:43.660
Not even the force, as it turns out.

06:43.660 --> 06:46.660
I do, now that it's been four years,

06:46.660 --> 06:50.660
I do just want to apologize to the people who were there.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.660
You did not get a good show, but...

06:52.660 --> 06:53.660
You got a great show.

06:53.660 --> 06:54.660
You got a weird show.

06:54.660 --> 06:56.660
For everyone else on the planet,

06:56.660 --> 06:59.660
it's funny that that show happened to you.

06:59.660 --> 07:03.660
But that show happened a long time ago

07:03.660 --> 07:06.660
in a theater that was here, so that part doesn't work.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.660
But we've grown.

07:07.660 --> 07:08.660
We've grown.

07:08.660 --> 07:12.660
Except in terms, again, as Justin demonstrably stated earlier,

07:12.660 --> 07:14.660
of audience following.

07:14.660 --> 07:18.660
Ability to sell tickets here in Detroit.

07:18.660 --> 07:20.660
Don't look at the balcony.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.660
Let's go. Let's do the damn thing.

07:22.660 --> 07:24.660
Oh, yeah, so we actually decided

07:24.660 --> 07:27.660
to do the best show we've ever done to make up for it.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.660
And that's the power of marketing.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.660
How do I stop my coworker from...

07:35.660 --> 07:36.660
Oh, it's also not too late.

07:36.660 --> 07:38.660
If you have friends in the area who aren't here...

07:38.660 --> 07:39.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.660
We'll keep the doors open.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.660
We'll cut them a good discount.

07:42.660 --> 07:43.660
You say, you ever seen...

07:43.660 --> 07:44.660
No, okay, yeah, Amanda says no.

07:44.660 --> 07:46.660
No discount, but they are welcome.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.660
Say, you ever seen a comedy podcast show

07:48.660 --> 07:51.660
from up higher in the theater?

07:51.660 --> 07:53.660
And farther back?

07:53.660 --> 07:55.660
It's just three guys at a table,

07:55.660 --> 07:57.660
so you'll have to squint to see them,

07:57.660 --> 07:58.660
but you'll love it.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.660
How do I stop my coworker

08:00.660 --> 08:03.660
from using the communal kettle to make hard-boiled eggs?

08:05.660 --> 08:08.660
I'm not a person to keep someone from enjoying a breakfast meal,

08:08.660 --> 08:11.660
but I use that same kettle she boils eggs in to make my tea.

08:11.660 --> 08:14.660
That's from Agoraphobic in Ontario.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.660
Welcome to America.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.660
That question is weird enough

08:18.660 --> 08:21.660
that I don't know what parts are Canada weird

08:21.660 --> 08:23.660
and which parts are America weird.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.660
There might be some parts that are Canada normal in there,

08:26.660 --> 08:28.660
like making eggs at work.

08:28.660 --> 08:30.660
Is it the communal kettle that's the problem?

08:30.660 --> 08:34.660
I think just to sort of skirt this whole thing in the future,

08:34.660 --> 08:38.660
it's illegal to bring ingredients to work.

08:40.660 --> 08:41.660
Yeah.

08:41.660 --> 08:44.660
Gone food and cold food are the only two.

08:44.660 --> 08:48.660
The time you spend poaching an egg in the cafeteria

08:48.660 --> 08:50.660
is time theft, I believe.

08:50.660 --> 08:51.660
Right.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.660
You are cooking now.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.660
I just also want to say,

08:55.660 --> 08:57.660
what type of person is the type of person

08:57.660 --> 08:59.660
to stop someone from enjoying breakfast food?

08:59.660 --> 09:02.660
That seems like a very specific thing that someone's into,

09:02.660 --> 09:05.660
like, it depends on what kind of burrito it is.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.660
The thing that really upsets me the most about this question

09:10.660 --> 09:12.660
is that they're better cold.

09:12.660 --> 09:13.660
Hard-boiled eggs?

09:13.660 --> 09:14.660
Oh, yeah.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.660
Why is this person not making them at home?

09:17.660 --> 09:18.660
It's so easy.

09:18.660 --> 09:20.660
Oh, they make them for the next day.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.660
Oh, I'm going to be enjoying these come lunchtime.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.660
You wait.

09:24.660 --> 09:27.660
That's really where the friction's coming from.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.660
It's that they can never make tea

09:29.660 --> 09:32.660
because those eggs are always in there.

09:32.660 --> 09:35.660
I like to make 45-minute eggs.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.660
Why would you bring...

09:36.660 --> 09:39.660
We've agreed that there should be no ingredients at work.

09:39.660 --> 09:40.660
Why would you bring an ingredient

09:40.660 --> 09:42.660
where there's a high likelihood you get to work

09:42.660 --> 09:43.660
and make the noise,

09:43.660 --> 09:45.660
oh, man.

09:45.660 --> 09:48.660
Oh, no, all the eggs, man.

09:48.660 --> 09:49.660
Okay, wait.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.660
Justin and Griffin, which one's weirder?

09:51.660 --> 09:53.660
Bringing a whole carton of eggs

09:53.660 --> 09:56.660
or bringing just enough to eat that day?

09:56.660 --> 09:58.660
A whole carton of eggs.

09:58.660 --> 09:59.660
That's so many eggs.

09:59.660 --> 10:01.660
Okay, but you're thinking about it, right?

10:01.660 --> 10:02.660
Yeah, I am thinking about it

10:02.660 --> 10:04.660
because if I'm going to make all hard-boiled eggs,

10:04.660 --> 10:05.660
I'm going to make six.

10:05.660 --> 10:06.660
I love those guys.

10:06.660 --> 10:09.660
Right, so the idea of I brought a raw...

10:09.660 --> 10:10.660
Yeah, a raw egg.

10:10.660 --> 10:11.660
Oh, this?

10:11.660 --> 10:13.660
I'm either going to eat it for lunch

10:13.660 --> 10:15.660
or see if I can build a parachute

10:15.660 --> 10:17.660
that will safely land it from a second story.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.660
I'm going to eat it for lunch

10:19.660 --> 10:20.660
or keep it alive for a week

10:20.660 --> 10:22.660
to teach you about being a parent.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.660
Because it's basically one and one.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.660
Take it from three parents, babies, eggs, same.

10:26.660 --> 10:31.660
Yeah, as long as you're not dropping babies are fine.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.660
I would actually, in many ways,

10:33.660 --> 10:34.660
rather drop a baby, but...

10:34.660 --> 10:36.660
The egg, that's interesting.

10:36.660 --> 10:39.660
Huh, we don't need to go into it.

10:39.660 --> 10:43.660
I don't understand how they're getting the eggs to work.

10:43.660 --> 10:45.660
That's all I can think about.

10:45.660 --> 10:46.660
It's got to be hand.

10:46.660 --> 10:50.660
It's got to be one egg and a hand.

10:50.660 --> 10:51.660
I don't know, I trust...

10:51.660 --> 10:56.660
If I can't see egg, it has squished already.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.660
I think that this is the point

10:58.660 --> 11:00.660
where you can go to the boss of this company and say,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.660
hey, I think you're requiring this person

11:02.660 --> 11:03.660
to get to work too early.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.660
They don't have time to boil an egg in the morning.

11:06.660 --> 11:09.660
Because if it's breakfast food, then it's like,

11:09.660 --> 11:11.660
get to work, first thing you do,

11:11.660 --> 11:13.660
pop on the kettle and boil an egg.

11:13.660 --> 11:16.660
I want to talk more about means of egg conveyance.

11:16.660 --> 11:19.660
And the armpit is the safest and it might hatch.

11:19.660 --> 11:22.660
I would say maybe they're door dashing it.

11:22.660 --> 11:24.660
I don't know if they got that Canada.

11:24.660 --> 11:26.660
It's where they bring you things.

11:26.660 --> 11:27.660
Like an egg?

11:27.660 --> 11:28.660
Like one egg?

11:28.660 --> 11:31.660
No, they get them door dashed every week

11:31.660 --> 11:33.660
and the guy's like, ah, floor 12.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.660
Yeah, send me on up, I got the eggs.

11:35.660 --> 11:38.660
Hi Valerie, I'm here with your weekly eggs.

11:38.660 --> 11:41.660
Man, I'd love a hard boiled egg right now.

11:41.660 --> 11:45.660
If I've ever seen an example of why HR exists,

11:45.660 --> 11:46.660
it is that.

11:46.660 --> 11:49.660
I'm just like, hey, I don't mean to be a pain,

11:49.660 --> 11:53.660
but Debbie is boiling eggs in the teapot.

11:53.660 --> 11:55.660
I go, yeah, that's an easy fix.

11:55.660 --> 11:57.660
I'll take care of this.

11:57.660 --> 11:58.660
This one's fixable.

11:58.660 --> 11:59.660
This one's easy.

11:59.660 --> 12:02.660
There are some way more complex things we've had to deal with.

12:02.660 --> 12:05.660
Don't boil eggs in the teapot.

12:05.660 --> 12:06.660
I've got this one.

12:06.660 --> 12:10.660
Hey, next white elephant gift exchange you do,

12:10.660 --> 12:12.660
just throw a teapot in the mix.

12:12.660 --> 12:16.660
It will solve the problem no matter who it ends up with.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.660
Ideally, it ends up with the egg pervert

12:19.660 --> 12:23.660
and then they can do their stuff at home.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.660
Maybe that's it.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.660
They're embarrassed.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.660
They don't know where to buy it.

12:27.660 --> 12:29.660
How does the water get this hot at work?

12:29.660 --> 12:31.660
Jesus Christ.

12:31.660 --> 12:36.660
Anybody notice the water gets so much hotter here at work?

12:36.660 --> 12:38.660
It makes bubbles like there's a little guy under there

12:38.660 --> 12:39.660
blowing water.

12:39.660 --> 12:40.660
This is weird.

12:40.660 --> 12:41.660
Guys, guys, check this out.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.660
I put a raw egg in.

12:42.660 --> 12:43.660
Well, watch this.

12:43.660 --> 12:44.660
Peel it.

12:44.660 --> 12:46.660
It does a goosh everywhere.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.660
Not goosh, not chicken, hard.

12:48.660 --> 12:50.660
What?

12:50.660 --> 12:54.660
This only happens at work.

12:54.660 --> 12:57.660
Call the science guy person.

12:57.660 --> 13:01.660
You know, whatever the Canadian version of Bill Nye is.

13:01.660 --> 13:03.660
That brief pause was all three of us

13:03.660 --> 13:05.660
trying to think of a funny version,

13:05.660 --> 13:08.660
Canadian version of Bill Nye coming up with Zilcho

13:08.660 --> 13:09.660
and moving on.

13:09.660 --> 13:11.660
William Nye was the best I had, and that wasn't it.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.660
That's nothing.

13:12.660 --> 13:13.660
I know.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.660
I'm glad you didn't say that out loud.

13:14.660 --> 13:18.660
So let's raise, we're going to raise the cultural bar

13:18.660 --> 13:20.660
a little bit here in Detroit, home of culture.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.660
Fancy is taking flight.

13:22.660 --> 13:24.660
And I thought that maybe we would make things

13:24.660 --> 13:27.660
just a little more adult

13:27.660 --> 13:30.660
and discuss some works of fart.

13:30.660 --> 13:38.660
I hate the stinger.

13:38.660 --> 13:42.660
I hate the stinger for this bit so bad.

13:42.660 --> 13:43.660
Griffin, this is tour manager Paul.

13:43.660 --> 13:44.660
So if you've never heard...

13:44.660 --> 13:45.660
Hold on, wait, Travis.

13:45.660 --> 13:48.660
I've got some alts on that opening if you'd like.

13:48.660 --> 13:49.660
Oh, okay.

13:49.660 --> 13:50.660
Yeah, if you don't mind,

13:50.660 --> 13:53.660
if you have one that the bit rate on the fart MP3

13:53.660 --> 13:54.660
is not like...

13:54.660 --> 13:57.660
I don't think it was loud enough for these riffs to land,

13:57.660 --> 13:58.660
so I'd love to hear it cranked again.

13:58.660 --> 13:59.660
Yeah, yeah.

13:59.660 --> 14:00.660
Everyone, listen.

14:00.660 --> 14:01.660
All right.

14:01.660 --> 14:02.660
This is my first new one,

14:02.660 --> 14:08.660
which is actually the one I just played.

14:08.660 --> 14:11.660
That sucks, Paul.

14:11.660 --> 14:14.660
Paul, that sounds so bad, my man.

14:14.660 --> 14:15.660
I love it.

14:15.660 --> 14:18.660
Paul, you do make music.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.660
So you know what it sounds like

14:20.660 --> 14:21.660
when a sound is pleasing to the ears.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.660
I don't know, if Paul wrote the music part,

14:23.660 --> 14:24.660
that was pretty good.

14:24.660 --> 14:25.660
Yeah, the music part was great.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.660
Do you have any with a fart that doesn't sound like

14:27.660 --> 14:31.660
it is coming through a payphone pulse, Warren?

14:31.660 --> 14:33.660
That was a high quality...

14:33.660 --> 14:35.660
Okay, wait.

14:35.660 --> 14:38.660
I want fully lossless audio codec, please, Paul.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.660
I need a quick pull to my ears.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.660
That was a pretty high quality fart.

14:42.660 --> 14:44.660
Are you fucking out of your mind?

14:44.660 --> 14:45.660
You.

14:45.660 --> 14:46.660
It seems you.

14:46.660 --> 14:47.660
Oh, beyond.

14:47.660 --> 14:48.660
Do you need comparison?

14:48.660 --> 14:51.660
Here's the original cue that you use for always...

14:51.660 --> 14:52.660
Don't play more of...

14:52.660 --> 14:59.660
Original cue.

14:59.660 --> 15:00.660
That's such fucking...

15:00.660 --> 15:05.660
That is a JPEG of a fart.

15:05.660 --> 15:07.660
All right, here's another alt.

15:07.660 --> 15:08.660
Paul!

15:08.660 --> 15:09.660
Try this one.

15:09.660 --> 15:14.660
Third option, hold on.

15:14.660 --> 15:22.660
Don't fucking clap for that.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.660
This is what...

15:23.660 --> 15:26.660
You guys deserve the fucking Star Wars show

15:26.660 --> 15:30.660
if this is what you like.

15:30.660 --> 15:37.660
The amount of hiss on the high end of that fart sound

15:37.660 --> 15:39.660
sucks so bad, Paul.

15:39.660 --> 15:44.660
And what drives me crazy is I know you know that.

15:44.660 --> 15:45.660
I got one more.

15:45.660 --> 15:46.660
Paul, don't!

15:46.660 --> 15:47.660
Okay, wait.

15:47.660 --> 15:53.660
One more, one more, one more.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.660
Fart.

15:55.660 --> 15:57.660
I honestly prefer it.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.660
All right, here we go.

15:59.660 --> 16:03.660
The way this works, I am going to describe the thing.

16:03.660 --> 16:06.660
This is a dumb fucking podcast.

16:06.660 --> 16:07.660
Go ahead.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.660
And then Griffin and Justin are going to guess what it is.

16:09.660 --> 16:11.660
So it might be a movie, might be a book.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.660
I forgot we were doing work of fart for a second.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.660
I was having a lot of fun with Paul over there.

16:15.660 --> 16:19.660
And so I was like embarrassed that we played the fart sound so many times.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.660
And then I was like, oh, good, that part's over.

16:21.660 --> 16:24.660
And now we can get to work of fart.

16:24.660 --> 16:29.660
A governess helps a single father raise his numerous children

16:29.660 --> 16:33.660
by teaching them to harmonize their farts.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.660
The sound of...

16:35.660 --> 16:36.660
Sound of Pusick.

16:36.660 --> 16:40.660
Yes, Justin gets it.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.660
That's one point for Justin.

16:42.660 --> 16:45.660
I was going to say the sound of Pusick, but that's not it, is it?

16:45.660 --> 16:46.660
That's not it.

16:46.660 --> 16:47.660
I'm slipping.

16:47.660 --> 16:53.660
This Joseph Heller novel examines the absurdity of war in military life

16:53.660 --> 16:57.660
while extolling the virtues of mutual pleasure.

16:57.660 --> 16:58.660
Fucking...

16:58.660 --> 17:04.660
Can you give me a hint of who the fuck that is?

17:04.660 --> 17:06.660
Okay, can you read it one more time?

17:06.660 --> 17:12.660
This Joseph Heller novel examines the absurdity of war in military life

17:12.660 --> 17:16.660
while extolling the virtues of mutual pleasure.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.660
Catch 20...

17:18.660 --> 17:21.660
Catch 20 Goo?

17:21.660 --> 17:22.660
What?

17:22.660 --> 17:23.660
Catch 20 Goo?

17:23.660 --> 17:26.660
Listen, mutual pleasure.

17:26.660 --> 17:27.660
Catch 69.

17:27.660 --> 17:29.660
Yes, it's Catch 69.

17:29.660 --> 17:32.660
No, no, no, someone in the audience said it.

17:32.660 --> 17:33.660
That's no points.

17:33.660 --> 17:34.660
Justin's still up.

17:34.660 --> 17:35.660
Okay, thank you.

17:35.660 --> 17:36.660
Okay.

17:36.660 --> 17:41.660
This 70s rock album was recorded in the aftermath of relationship breakups

17:41.660 --> 17:45.660
among the band's members and heavy bathrooming,

17:45.660 --> 17:48.660
both of which shaped the album's lyrics.

17:48.660 --> 17:49.660
Poomers?

17:49.660 --> 17:51.660
Poomers, yes, Justin.

17:51.660 --> 17:55.660
You're getting a little predictable in your twilight years.

17:55.660 --> 17:57.660
All right, all right, all right.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.660
Oh, rumors, this is all rumors.

17:59.660 --> 18:00.660
Okay, okay.

18:00.660 --> 18:04.660
Perhaps Tolstoy's greatest work.

18:04.660 --> 18:08.660
This novel focuses on Napoleon's Russian invasion

18:08.660 --> 18:11.660
and features three main characters who pee on everything.

18:11.660 --> 18:13.660
Warren Peas?

18:13.660 --> 18:14.660
Close.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.660
Warren Piss?

18:15.660 --> 18:19.660
Warren Piss, yes, that is correct, Griffin.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.660
Okay, it's down to the wire, it's two and two.

18:22.660 --> 18:27.660
Everybody scoot back, you're on the edge of your seats.

18:27.660 --> 18:33.660
This Joyce classic is the story of a day in the life of Leopold Bloom

18:33.660 --> 18:36.660
as he travels Dublin and goes about his business.

18:36.660 --> 18:38.660
Is it Pulisies?

18:38.660 --> 18:42.660
Yes.

18:42.660 --> 18:43.660
You didn't let me finish!

18:43.660 --> 18:44.660
I didn't even get a...

18:44.660 --> 18:45.660
Can I finish?

18:45.660 --> 18:46.660
Yeah, please.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.660
Just a lot of poo ones this time.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.660
As he travels Dublin and goes about his business,

18:50.660 --> 18:53.660
attending a funeral, buying soap, going to the library,

18:53.660 --> 18:55.660
walking by the beach, going to the pub,

18:55.660 --> 19:02.660
but mostly his six-hour epic long shitting session.

19:02.660 --> 19:03.660
Pulisies.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.660
Yes, Justin wins!

19:05.660 --> 19:06.660
Oh, that was it?

19:06.660 --> 19:10.660
Let's hear it for Justin.

19:10.660 --> 19:17.660
If it's gotten to the point where we can just take any media

19:17.660 --> 19:20.660
with a title that has the ooh sound in it.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.660
Yes.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.660
Right, that is the point we're at

19:22.660 --> 19:23.660
and the point we've been at.

19:23.660 --> 19:24.660
Yes.

19:24.660 --> 19:25.660
Okay, cool.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.660
I'll remember that for next time.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.660
That's when I've got you.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.660
I work at a pizza place delivering said...

19:31.660 --> 19:33.660
No, you don't.

19:33.660 --> 19:34.660
Please go ahead, Justin.

19:34.660 --> 19:38.660
I work at a pizza place delivering said pizzas to people's homes.

19:38.660 --> 19:41.660
I also moved out on my own recently, so money's been tight.

19:41.660 --> 19:42.660
I make and deliver pizzas.

19:42.660 --> 19:43.660
Thank you for coming.

19:43.660 --> 19:44.660
I appreciate that.

19:44.660 --> 19:45.660
Thank you.

19:45.660 --> 19:48.660
I make and deliver dozens of orders a day.

19:48.660 --> 19:51.660
This is normally not a problem except for when I'm hungry.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.660
Then the hunger comes

19:53.660 --> 19:55.660
and I crave the greasy pie.

19:55.660 --> 19:59.660
Brothers, is there a way for me to get free pizza from my job

19:59.660 --> 20:02.660
without leaving my customers short of a slice?

20:02.660 --> 20:04.660
That's from delivering in Detroit.

20:04.660 --> 20:07.660
What I love about this is you phrased it in such a way,

20:07.660 --> 20:10.660
but what you're asking about is can I take a piece of pizza

20:10.660 --> 20:13.660
out of the box before I deliver it, right?

20:13.660 --> 20:16.660
Yeah, Trav, clearly that was the context of the question.

20:16.660 --> 20:19.660
Because you can get free food from a restaurant you work at.

20:19.660 --> 20:20.660
That happens all the time.

20:20.660 --> 20:23.660
You make the pizza wrong and then you get to eat it.

20:23.660 --> 20:25.660
That's the rules at pizza.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.660
But I don't think they want that.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.660
There's something about it that gets your motor running

20:30.660 --> 20:32.660
instead of eating somebody else's pizza.

20:32.660 --> 20:33.660
The illicit pie.

20:33.660 --> 20:35.660
The OPP, that's what it stands for.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.660
Oh, is that what it stands for?

20:37.660 --> 20:38.660
I've always wondered, yeah.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.660
The whole time, that's what it stood for.

20:40.660 --> 20:43.660
So here's my first pitch to you.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.660
Bring, bring, welcome to Pac-Man's Pizza,

20:45.660 --> 20:48.660
home of the famous Pac-Man pizza

20:48.660 --> 20:51.660
where every pizza looks like Pac-Man.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.660
Uh-huh, yeah, it's a promotion.

20:54.660 --> 20:55.660
Uh-huh, yeah.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.660
It's a promotion that we named our business after.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.660
It's a promotion that was so successful

20:59.660 --> 21:00.660
we named our business after it.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.660
Do you want, for the little dots,

21:03.660 --> 21:05.660
do you want red bites or pepperoni?

21:05.660 --> 21:06.660
Sorry.

21:06.660 --> 21:09.660
Waka, waka, waka, waka.

21:09.660 --> 21:10.660
Pac-a-roni.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.660
They make us call them Pac-a-roni,

21:12.660 --> 21:15.660
but that's confusing because it sounds like macaroni.

21:15.660 --> 21:17.660
Waka, waka, waka.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.660
Welcome to Elijah's Pizza

21:19.660 --> 21:21.660
where we leave a slice out for our boy.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.660
Just a big stack of them at the end of the day,

21:26.660 --> 21:29.660
but then when none of us are looking, they disappear.

21:29.660 --> 21:32.660
Elijah loves fucking pizza, man.

21:32.660 --> 21:33.660
Loves that stuff.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.660
Why don't you give them their total?

21:35.660 --> 21:37.660
You just say, and we have a way

21:37.660 --> 21:40.660
for your order to be one-eighth cheaper.

21:40.660 --> 21:43.660
Would you be interested in that promotion today?

21:43.660 --> 21:45.660
Would you be interested in built-in tip?

21:45.660 --> 21:49.660
Yes, welcome to Pac-Man's where you'd never have to tip

21:49.660 --> 21:52.660
because we already took it out of the box on our way over.

21:52.660 --> 21:57.660
I think there is a reality in which you could swing this

21:57.660 --> 22:00.660
just based on facial expression,

22:00.660 --> 22:05.660
based on just sort of like guilt, non-verbalized guilt.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.660
Just like, yeah, and here's your pizza, man.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.660
Oh, thank you. Thanks for the tip.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.660
Oh, that looks really good.

22:11.660 --> 22:12.660
Yeah, man.

22:12.660 --> 22:13.660
You guys are going to love that.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.660
It looks so gooey and delicious.

22:16.660 --> 22:17.660
I wish I had pizza.

22:17.660 --> 22:22.660
Damn, I wish I had just even a little bit of that pizza.

22:22.660 --> 22:24.660
Wouldn't it be dope if they made it

22:24.660 --> 22:28.660
so you could easily separate out a small little,

22:28.660 --> 22:32.660
like a segment of the, a piece of the pizza that I could have?

22:32.660 --> 22:34.660
Anyways, back to my car that smells like pizza

22:34.660 --> 22:36.660
but doesn't taste like it.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.660
Maybe you could try like, and whenever you're done,

22:39.660 --> 22:41.660
just leave whatever you don't want on the porch.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.660
I'll come back.

22:43.660 --> 22:48.660
That's the service we are at Raccoon's Pizza.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.660
We have these new Tupperware boxes, so it all keeps,

22:51.660 --> 22:53.660
and I'll just come get it from you, no problem.

22:53.660 --> 22:55.660
This is my number. Just text me when you're done.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.660
Also, if you have any batteries you need to dispose of,

22:58.660 --> 23:02.660
I'm happy to grab those too, as long as I'm here.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.660
Even if it's just a couple pepperoni stuck to the box, man.

23:05.660 --> 23:06.660
Just let me know.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.660
Yeah, also like old paint.

23:08.660 --> 23:09.660
I'll come get that.

23:09.660 --> 23:10.660
Anything you got, bud.

23:10.660 --> 23:11.660
Where are you needing me to get rid of?

23:11.660 --> 23:13.660
I'm trying to think.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.660
If you take a piece out, but then you get like a circle

23:17.660 --> 23:21.660
out of the very center of the remainder of the pizza,

23:21.660 --> 23:25.660
can you just squish it back together?

23:25.660 --> 23:26.660
I don't think so.

23:26.660 --> 23:27.660
No, you can't actually.

23:27.660 --> 23:28.660
No, not that way.

23:28.660 --> 23:29.660
Not that way.

23:29.660 --> 23:30.660
No, wait, you could do.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.660
You could take one piece out and make a cone.

23:32.660 --> 23:35.660
You could take one rectangular slice.

23:35.660 --> 23:36.660
Okay, wait.

23:36.660 --> 23:37.660
Okay, hold on.

23:37.660 --> 23:38.660
Try to push people into square cut pizza.

23:38.660 --> 23:40.660
When you square cut their pizza,

23:40.660 --> 23:43.660
take the column of squares from the center.

23:43.660 --> 23:44.660
Yes.

23:44.660 --> 23:52.660
And then smoosh the halves, the remaining halves back together.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.660
I've seen two shows.

23:54.660 --> 23:58.660
I saw the Star Wars one and the one where they were helpful.

23:58.660 --> 23:59.660
It's amazing.

23:59.660 --> 24:00.660
Those are the two I've seen.

24:00.660 --> 24:02.660
Maybe you could do pizza origami and be like,

24:02.660 --> 24:05.660
I can turn it into a beautiful fleur de lis.

24:05.660 --> 24:09.660
One slice's worth of pizza will have to hit the cutting room floor

24:09.660 --> 24:11.660
in order to make this complicated pattern happen.

24:11.660 --> 24:12.660
An artistic cut.

24:12.660 --> 24:13.660
Yeah.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.660
Or like a pizza like Tesseract, right?

24:15.660 --> 24:17.660
We all think of it in a circle.

24:17.660 --> 24:18.660
Sure, sure.

24:18.660 --> 24:20.660
But what if it was a series of triangles

24:20.660 --> 24:22.660
forming a non-geometric shape?

24:22.660 --> 24:25.660
That is what a Tesseract is for sure.

24:25.660 --> 24:28.660
It's even better to think from a wrinkle in time.

24:28.660 --> 24:29.660
It's both, yeah, for sure.

24:29.660 --> 24:30.660
You got it.

24:30.660 --> 24:34.660
Hey, could you take a slice and then fold the pizza in half?

24:34.660 --> 24:37.660
And try to insist it's a calzone

24:37.660 --> 24:39.660
and the missing slice is on the bottom.

24:39.660 --> 24:42.660
The missing slice is inside.

24:42.660 --> 24:44.660
Yeah, well, by the time they realize that you're gone,

24:44.660 --> 24:46.660
maybe they'll never...

24:46.660 --> 24:47.660
Well, that's the other thing.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.660
Rarely have I ever had a pizza delivered

24:49.660 --> 24:52.660
and I open it to check before they leave.

24:52.660 --> 24:57.660
Okay, but I do do that because my kids like cheese and no sauce.

24:57.660 --> 24:58.660
Yeah.

24:58.660 --> 25:01.660
And then Cooper likes sausage and no cheese.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.660
So I do have to look at them

25:03.660 --> 25:06.660
because everyone assumes we're kidding.

25:06.660 --> 25:08.660
No, they didn't mean it.

25:08.660 --> 25:09.660
They didn't mean that.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.660
Can you deliver the pizza,

25:11.660 --> 25:14.660
take three pieces in the other direction,

25:14.660 --> 25:15.660
and then turn around and be like,

25:15.660 --> 25:18.660
my lord, wait, let me test the pizza.

25:18.660 --> 25:20.660
There have been assassins.

25:20.660 --> 25:23.660
The Assassin's Guild has been active lately, my liege.

25:23.660 --> 25:24.660
No, not the anchovy.

25:24.660 --> 25:26.660
Those are usually safe.

25:26.660 --> 25:28.660
I want the good one.

25:28.660 --> 25:32.660
Let me lay down mine life for you, my liege.

25:32.660 --> 25:35.660
I would love you to just start trying.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.660
When you drop the pizza off, just be like,

25:37.660 --> 25:39.660
can I get a slice?

25:39.660 --> 25:40.660
Yeah.

25:40.660 --> 25:41.660
Hey, man.

25:41.660 --> 25:42.660
I notice you open the door.

25:42.660 --> 25:43.660
I look inside.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.660
There's one chair face of the TV.

25:45.660 --> 25:46.660
You're not going to finish this whole thing.

25:46.660 --> 25:47.660
Let me get a slice.

25:47.660 --> 25:48.660
I'm not going to come in or make it weird.

25:48.660 --> 25:49.660
Just let me get a slice.

25:49.660 --> 25:51.660
Any pizza you've ever gotten that would've worked on you.

25:51.660 --> 25:52.660
Correct?

25:52.660 --> 25:54.660
100% of the time, I'd be like, absolutely, get in there.

25:54.660 --> 25:55.660
No, hold on.

25:55.660 --> 25:56.660
Logically, yes, Justin.

25:56.660 --> 25:57.660
Get in there.

25:57.660 --> 25:58.660
Emotionally, no.

25:58.660 --> 25:59.660
No.

25:59.660 --> 26:00.660
Someone brings you a pizza and goes,

26:00.660 --> 26:02.660
hold on, let me get a slice.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.660
No.

26:03.660 --> 26:04.660
I'd be like, I'm calling the police.

26:04.660 --> 26:05.660
It would be a request.

26:05.660 --> 26:06.660
It would be a request.

26:06.660 --> 26:08.660
Like, can I get a slice before I go?

26:08.660 --> 26:12.660
Rebrand the entire business like,

26:12.660 --> 26:15.660
Burgle Boys Pizza Factory.

26:15.660 --> 26:17.660
And the promotion can be,

26:17.660 --> 26:20.660
our pizza is so fucking delicious

26:20.660 --> 26:24.660
that our own delivery people will try to,

26:24.660 --> 26:26.660
sometimes our pizza is going to show up incomplete.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.660
It's because our pizza is so goddamn delicious.

26:28.660 --> 26:29.660
Let me throw this out.

26:29.660 --> 26:31.660
Pizza and pal.

26:31.660 --> 26:32.660
Where it's like, hey man,

26:32.660 --> 26:34.660
you feel like playing Mario Kart?

26:34.660 --> 26:35.660
Order a pizza.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.660
They'll show up, eat the pizza with you

26:37.660 --> 26:38.660
and play Mario Kart with you.

26:38.660 --> 26:39.660
Yes, I cannot stress enough

26:39.660 --> 26:42.660
how much there was a very narrow period of my life

26:42.660 --> 26:43.660
where I would've wanted this very badly.

26:43.660 --> 26:46.660
And then every other period of my life

26:46.660 --> 26:52.660
where I would very much not want this very, very badly.

26:52.660 --> 26:53.660
Give me a slice of pizza

26:53.660 --> 26:55.660
or I'm gonna play Mario Kart with you.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.660
Fucking, yeah, whatever you say, man.

26:57.660 --> 26:58.660
It's a sustainable model.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.660
It's just like weed delivery.

27:01.660 --> 27:06.660
My friends and family hate how I eat fruit.

27:06.660 --> 27:09.660
And here's our next question.

27:09.660 --> 27:12.660
Primarily, how I eat kiwis,

27:12.660 --> 27:13.660
like when we eat an apple.

27:13.660 --> 27:15.660
Skin and all.

27:15.660 --> 27:18.660
They also hate my, and now you're about to hate it,

27:18.660 --> 27:23.660
scrape and lick method of eating banana.

27:23.660 --> 27:26.660
I don't utilize either of those verbs

27:26.660 --> 27:29.660
when I eat a banana traditionally.

27:29.660 --> 27:32.660
It's where I scrape my top teeth along my banana

27:32.660 --> 27:37.660
to collect and enjoy the sweet aerated banana goo.

27:37.660 --> 27:41.660
Hey, you know, I just had a realization.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.660
There is at least one person in this room

27:44.660 --> 27:46.660
that can relate to what it feels like

27:46.660 --> 27:48.660
to fill in this room full of people

27:48.660 --> 27:50.660
that are disgusted by you.

27:50.660 --> 27:54.660
And I'm so happy we could share that feeling with you.

27:54.660 --> 27:56.660
How do I get them to see the right

27:56.660 --> 27:58.660
and proper way to eat fruit?

27:58.660 --> 28:00.660
That's from fruit muncher in Michigan.

28:00.660 --> 28:02.660
Okay, okay.

28:02.660 --> 28:06.660
Right and proper is a stretch.

28:06.660 --> 28:11.660
Justifiable fringe option is the best you might get.

28:11.660 --> 28:13.660
Hey, what's up?

28:13.660 --> 28:14.660
Oh, right, Griffin.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.660
Hey, I'm your friend.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.660
You can trust me.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.660
You came to my show.

28:20.660 --> 28:21.660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

28:21.660 --> 28:24.660
I'm your friend.

28:24.660 --> 28:27.660
You got to cut this shit out because...

28:27.660 --> 28:29.660
No, stop, hold on.

28:29.660 --> 28:33.660
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

28:33.660 --> 28:41.660
You think, what's a few times eating a banana funny?

28:41.660 --> 28:43.660
This...

28:43.660 --> 28:50.660
I'm a complicated person with a lot of stuff going on.

28:50.660 --> 28:56.660
I'm a New York Times bestselling author and yet...

28:56.660 --> 29:03.660
Everyone knows me as the guy who ate a banana weird one time.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.660
You...

29:05.660 --> 29:06.660
It's...

29:06.660 --> 29:11.660
Listen, we didn't say your Christian name.

29:11.660 --> 29:13.660
It's not too late.

29:13.660 --> 29:15.660
We are...

29:15.660 --> 29:19.660
I am three ghosts of Christmas from different times.

29:19.660 --> 29:22.660
Stop it.

29:22.660 --> 29:24.660
This doesn't have to be you.

29:24.660 --> 29:29.660
There was a time to back Griffin up where you did this the first time.

29:29.660 --> 29:30.660
Yeah.

29:30.660 --> 29:31.660
Maybe by accident.

29:31.660 --> 29:32.660
Maybe you didn't know better.

29:32.660 --> 29:33.660
I don't know.

29:33.660 --> 29:35.660
And you did it and people reacted in horror.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.660
They loved it.

29:37.660 --> 29:41.660
And you made the decision of I'm going to buy into it.

29:41.660 --> 29:42.660
Yeah.

29:42.660 --> 29:43.660
And that decision was wrong.

29:43.660 --> 29:45.660
It was a bad wrong decision.

29:45.660 --> 29:53.660
Although, I think we can all agree, the best way to eat a banana, squeeze it from the bottom, let the banana pop out, you catch it in your mouth.

29:53.660 --> 29:54.660
Yeah.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.660
And then you smile at the bananas.

29:56.660 --> 29:58.660
You swallow it.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.660
You see a shape of the banana in your throat.

30:00.660 --> 30:01.660
It's hilarious.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.660
Do it 30 more times.

30:03.660 --> 30:04.660
Hilarious.

30:04.660 --> 30:07.660
Right in front of them in that one sitting.

30:07.660 --> 30:10.660
We're kind of just ignoring the kiwi part, aren't we?

30:10.660 --> 30:13.660
Because there's no justification for that.

30:13.660 --> 30:16.660
That's beyond the pale.

30:16.660 --> 30:20.660
That came from a different point in the audience.

30:20.660 --> 30:21.660
No, listen.

30:21.660 --> 30:23.660
That's the hairy part.

30:23.660 --> 30:29.660
If you tell me any food stuff you eat with the hair on it, I will sit and I will listen to it.

30:29.660 --> 30:30.660
Don't say peach.

30:30.660 --> 30:31.660
That doesn't count.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.660
You know it doesn't count.

30:33.660 --> 30:40.660
You know it's different and you wanted to shout it anyway?

30:40.660 --> 30:45.660
I'm not interested in what hairy foods you eat, Detroit.

30:45.660 --> 30:50.660
Especially when, frankly, it's one or two voices of thousands.

30:50.660 --> 30:55.660
You must know if everyone's not shouting something, you shouldn't shout.

30:55.660 --> 31:03.660
Because if you're the only one shouting out the hairy food that everyone supposedly eats, they don't.

31:03.660 --> 31:06.660
Stop it.

31:06.660 --> 31:10.660
We're trying to save you.

31:10.660 --> 31:23.660
I cannot imagine an axis that one would eat a banana upon where scraping it with your teeth is remotely acceptable.

31:23.660 --> 31:29.660
There had to be at least a few times where you scrape too hard and break it and it falls on the floor.

31:29.660 --> 31:32.660
Unless you only peel off one section of peel.

31:32.660 --> 31:35.660
They scrape it with their teeth.

31:35.660 --> 31:39.660
You peel off one of four sections and then you scrape down.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.660
It's all bad.

31:41.660 --> 31:42.660
No, it's not good.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.660
I'm just saying.

31:44.660 --> 31:48.660
My daughter breaks a banana in half like it's a strength contest.

31:48.660 --> 31:49.660
That's great.

31:49.660 --> 31:50.660
I like that.

31:50.660 --> 31:53.660
She hit her banana and her daughter just goes.

31:53.660 --> 32:01.660
If your problem is that the fruit you're eating isn't light and airy enough, don't eat a banana.

32:01.660 --> 32:06.660
Famously, a thick fruit.

32:06.660 --> 32:10.660
Most of them are just kind of water and like latex.

32:10.660 --> 32:12.660
That's about what most fruits are.

32:12.660 --> 32:15.660
Orange, like gone.

32:15.660 --> 32:20.660
Bananas can't be that for you and it's weird that you want the banana to be that for you.

32:20.660 --> 32:23.660
There are also plenty of fruits that are designed to be eaten weird.

32:23.660 --> 32:25.660
Like we had to work at a pomegranate.

32:25.660 --> 32:30.660
We all had to get on board with the way to harvest a pomegranate and agree it was worth the trouble.

32:30.660 --> 32:32.660
Banana easy to eat.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.660
Yeah, that one's got the whole system built right in.

32:35.660 --> 32:39.660
It's like God in his infinite wisdom put a handle on it.

32:39.660 --> 32:41.660
Here he goes again.

32:41.660 --> 32:52.660
I would love to watch you eat a banana in front of Kirk Cameron and turn him into a stone cold atheist.

32:52.660 --> 32:53.660
You're right.

32:53.660 --> 32:54.660
You're right.

32:54.660 --> 32:55.660
It all makes sense.

32:55.660 --> 32:59.660
I know what I said, but wow.

32:59.660 --> 33:01.660
It is a broken system.

33:01.660 --> 33:15.660
I've never cussed before, but holy shit.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.660
If you're anything like me around this time of year, you typically find yourself saying,

33:19.660 --> 33:27.660
wow, I really wish that I had just prepared even a little bit, just a little bit of advanced preparation.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.660
This is earlier.

33:29.660 --> 33:30.660
This is now.

33:30.660 --> 33:36.660
You're in that moment and there is no better partner for that than stamps.com.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.660
It'll make it so easy.

33:38.660 --> 33:42.660
You'll want to get out ahead of your holiday shopping that you need to do.

33:42.660 --> 33:55.660
Stamps.com is a one stop shop, not just USPS fine service that it is, but also UPS services need to run your holiday operation right from your computer.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.660
You don't have to deal with the lines.

33:57.660 --> 33:58.660
There's no traffic.

33:58.660 --> 33:59.660
There's no hassle.

33:59.660 --> 34:04.660

34:26.660 --> 34:30.660
Hey, while I've got you here and you're doing this shopping, you got your stamps all covered.

34:30.660 --> 34:31.660
Fantastic.

34:31.660 --> 34:34.660
But how do you know that you're getting the best deal outside of the world of stamps?

34:34.660 --> 34:38.660
Well, there, my friend, you're going to rely on Honey.

34:38.660 --> 34:43.660
It's a really easy to install browser extension.

34:43.660 --> 34:47.660
PayPal Honey makes it easy to see if you could save a little bit of money.

34:47.660 --> 34:52.660
It takes, you know, a couple of clicks to install it in this free tool.

34:52.660 --> 34:57.660
When you go to check out, it'll look for coupons for what you are purchasing.

34:57.660 --> 35:04.660
And that is thrilling because you get to save some money that you didn't think you were going to save.

35:04.660 --> 35:07.660
I mean, what better feeling is there than that?

35:07.660 --> 35:10.660
Honey will look for a coupon and find something that works.

35:10.660 --> 35:12.660
The price just drops just like that.

35:12.660 --> 35:18.660
I've saved money on a lot of tools for woodworking.

35:18.660 --> 35:21.660
I've gotten some headphones at a really nice discount.

35:21.660 --> 35:22.660
Hachi machi.

35:22.660 --> 35:25.660
You're just losing money to not install Honey.

35:25.660 --> 35:30.660
You can save even more when you ask Honey to keep track of price drops on your holiday shopping list.

35:30.660 --> 35:33.660
If the price drops in anything on your list, you instantly get an alert to let you know.

35:33.660 --> 35:37.660
If you don't already have Honey, you're just missing out.

35:37.660 --> 35:41.660
By getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid and you're supporting our show.

35:41.660 --> 35:43.660
You like our show, right?

35:43.660 --> 35:46.660

35:46.660 --> 35:50.660
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

35:50.660 --> 35:52.660
And now, back to the show.

35:54.660 --> 35:55.660
Hey, I'm Dan McCoy.

35:55.660 --> 35:56.660
I'm Stuart Wellington.

35:56.660 --> 35:58.660
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

35:58.660 --> 35:59.660
Listen, you like podcasts, right?

35:59.660 --> 36:00.660
Sure you do.

36:00.660 --> 36:01.660
Don't try and lie to me.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.660
You're listening to one right now.

36:02.660 --> 36:06.660
So why not try a different one called our one, The Flophouse.

36:06.660 --> 36:09.660
And on The Flophouse, we watch a movie and talk about it.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.660
And then sometimes we also do other stuff.

36:11.660 --> 36:14.660
It's all meant to be funny and fun, and we think you'll have a good time.

36:14.660 --> 36:18.660
And just to be clear, the name of the podcast is not our one, The Flophouse.

36:18.660 --> 36:19.660
It's just called The Flophouse.

36:19.660 --> 36:21.660
I do a lot of correcting Dan.

36:21.660 --> 36:24.660
The Flophouse, a lot of correcting Dan.

36:27.660 --> 36:31.660
Hey, it's Jon Moe, inviting you to listen to Depressed Mode with Jon Moe,

36:31.660 --> 36:35.660
where I talk about mental health and the lives we live with all kinds of people.

36:35.660 --> 36:36.660
Famous writers.

36:36.660 --> 36:38.660
David Sedaris, welcome to Depressed Mode.

36:38.660 --> 36:40.660
Thanks so much for having me.

36:40.660 --> 36:41.660
Movie stars.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.660
Jamie Lee Curtis, welcome to Depressed Mode.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.660
I am happy to be here.

36:45.660 --> 36:46.660
Musicians.

36:46.660 --> 36:47.660
I am in St. Paul, Minnesota.

36:47.660 --> 36:49.660
I'm talking to Amy Mann.

36:49.660 --> 36:50.660
Great to talk to you.

36:50.660 --> 36:52.660
And song exploders.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.660
Rishi K. Sherway, welcome to Depressed Mode.

36:54.660 --> 36:55.660
Thanks so much for having me.

36:55.660 --> 37:19.660
Everyone's opening up on Depressed Mode on Maximum Fun.

37:19.660 --> 37:29.660
I want to munch.

37:29.660 --> 37:30.660
Welcome to Munch Squad.

37:30.660 --> 37:36.660
It's a podcast, then a podcast profile, the latest, greatest brand eating.

37:36.660 --> 37:41.660
And I waited as long as I could because I got two different huge topics to cover.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.660
And the first one, you know we're going to talk about it, Detroit.

37:44.660 --> 37:46.660
I went to DoorDash.

37:46.660 --> 37:50.660
A app my father is incapable of using without ordering from Georgia.

37:50.660 --> 37:51.660
I've saved this, by the way.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.660
He's told this story multiple times this evening.

37:54.660 --> 37:57.660
There's a moment when you try to order from a different place where DoorDash goes.

37:57.660 --> 37:58.660
You're pretty far away.

37:58.660 --> 37:59.660
You seem pretty far away.

37:59.660 --> 38:02.660
So you know, Dad went, never mind that.

38:02.660 --> 38:03.660
Oh, well.

38:03.660 --> 38:05.660
We'll figure it out.

38:05.660 --> 38:09.660
Hey, guys, let's talk about the crypto grill.

38:09.660 --> 38:15.660
If you go to DoorDash here, and I don't think it's a real place you can go to,

38:15.660 --> 38:20.660
which makes it probably the wildest ghost restaurant I've ever heard of in my life.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.660
Let's talk about the crypto grill.

38:22.660 --> 38:31.660
I have no context for any of this, but they do have a lot of different crypto themed items like the NFT milk.

38:31.660 --> 38:33.660
Like the crypto burger.

38:33.660 --> 38:36.660
That's the best you've got?

38:36.660 --> 38:38.660
Yeah, it gets worse, bud.

38:38.660 --> 38:41.660
Loaded cyber fries.

38:41.660 --> 38:43.660
But then also curly fries.

38:43.660 --> 38:46.660
They got curly fries or loaded cyber fries.

38:46.660 --> 38:51.660
If you order the curly fries from the crypto grill, fuck you.

38:51.660 --> 38:57.660
Man, do you remember like two decades ago when if you called the place Crypto Grill,

38:57.660 --> 38:59.660
it was about spooky stuff?

38:59.660 --> 39:00.660
Yeah, that's why I clicked on it.

39:00.660 --> 39:02.660
I thought I was going to get a Bigfoot burger.

39:02.660 --> 39:03.660
No dice.

39:03.660 --> 39:04.660
Damn it.

39:04.660 --> 39:05.660
Cyber fries is good.

39:05.660 --> 39:08.660
I will patronize them just for the cyber fries though.

39:08.660 --> 39:11.660
Because what do they have in there that makes them cyber?

39:11.660 --> 39:12.660
Chips.

39:12.660 --> 39:13.660
There's the beef.

39:13.660 --> 39:15.660
There's the beef dono.

39:15.660 --> 39:16.660
The baldana.

39:16.660 --> 39:17.660
The bytecoin.

39:17.660 --> 39:18.660
The bytecoin.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.660
The bytecoin is good.

39:20.660 --> 39:23.660
The ethereparm sandwich.

39:23.660 --> 39:24.660
That sucks.

39:24.660 --> 39:25.660
It's so bad.

39:25.660 --> 39:26.660
It's so bad.

39:26.660 --> 39:32.660
I will gladly write your new blockchain jokes for the blockchain burger.

39:32.660 --> 39:34.660
Ethereum mixed drink with rum in it.

39:34.660 --> 39:35.660
Yeah, there we go.

39:35.660 --> 39:36.660
The litecoin.

39:36.660 --> 39:39.660
And then they have brisket loaded waffle fries,

39:39.660 --> 39:42.660
which I looked at for a while and then thought that's just that.

39:42.660 --> 39:44.660
Yeah.

39:44.660 --> 39:50.660
Then there's also an item on here called the Crypto Lettuce Surprise You Sauce.

39:50.660 --> 39:52.660
I don't believe I will actually.

39:52.660 --> 39:54.660
Thank you for asking.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.660
Let us pick the best sauce for what you ordered.

39:56.660 --> 40:02.660
What in our relationship lets you think I trust you with anything?

40:02.660 --> 40:03.660
With anything.

40:03.660 --> 40:09.660
I love the Crypto Sauce are the only words in there outside of quotation wise.

40:09.660 --> 40:13.660
So it says Crypto Lettuce Surprise You Sauce.

40:13.660 --> 40:16.660
So crypto has nothing to do with it whatsoever.

40:16.660 --> 40:19.660
But they also have a Superman cheesecake,

40:19.660 --> 40:22.660
which has nothing to do with crypto, but is a specific reference.

40:22.660 --> 40:23.660
Don't be cowards.

40:23.660 --> 40:28.660
By the time we come back here and perform in four more calendar years in Detroit, Michigan,

40:28.660 --> 40:30.660
I expect them to have their act together.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.660
Yeah.

40:31.660 --> 40:35.660
I did want to talk about, you know, because we want to make this show special.

40:35.660 --> 40:37.660
I want to do a Munch Squad about one that's just good.

40:37.660 --> 40:38.660
Okay.

40:38.660 --> 40:39.660
This is Burger King.

40:39.660 --> 40:40.660
I was thinking about him recently.

40:40.660 --> 40:42.660
Like, you don't hear about them getting the mix.

40:42.660 --> 40:44.660
They don't get nasty so much.

40:44.660 --> 40:48.660
They had that one foul up with the black burger bun that gave everybody weird poops.

40:48.660 --> 40:49.660
And then they quit.

40:49.660 --> 40:52.660
It was a pretty, it was a pretty big whoopsie they made.

40:52.660 --> 40:53.660
I will say.

40:53.660 --> 40:54.660
Yeah.

40:54.660 --> 40:58.660
But like, you know, Burger King does one weird poop food and Taco Bell is like,

40:58.660 --> 41:01.660
call me when you've mastered it.

41:01.660 --> 41:06.660
I literally, I had a thought, they got to do something to get back in the game.

41:06.660 --> 41:09.660
And then I found this press release from October 6th that said,

41:09.660 --> 41:13.660
today Burger King unveils its brand new positioning and campaign,

41:13.660 --> 41:17.660
kicking off with its modernized tagline, you rule.

41:17.660 --> 41:20.660
The work is part of the change guests nationwide will experience

41:20.660 --> 41:24.660
as the brand implements its reclaim the flame plan,

41:24.660 --> 41:26.660
which means that no one likes Burger King.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.660
Wait, now hold on. Listen.

41:28.660 --> 41:32.660
Reclaim the flame as a slogan announced by, let's say,

41:32.660 --> 41:37.660
many groups that exist within the US of A is a terrifying statement.

41:37.660 --> 41:38.660
Yes.

41:38.660 --> 41:44.660
It also could be like, Ashen One, you must travel across these blighted lands.

41:44.660 --> 41:47.660
Reclaim the flame.

41:47.660 --> 41:48.660
So reclaim.

41:48.660 --> 41:51.660
Here's a skeleton horse or some shit.

41:51.660 --> 41:54.660
So reclaim the flame is the superstructure.

41:54.660 --> 41:58.660
And then this is part of the fuel the flame advertising co-investment

41:58.660 --> 42:00.660
between Burger King and its franchisees.

42:00.660 --> 42:01.660
It's the you rule.

42:01.660 --> 42:02.660
Who's hungry?

42:02.660 --> 42:03.660
Campaign.

42:03.660 --> 42:07.660
It's a key part of their positioning that will impact every guest's touch point.

42:07.660 --> 42:08.660
It's about.

42:08.660 --> 42:11.660
My touch points.

42:11.660 --> 42:14.660
It's about celebrating everyday royalty

42:14.660 --> 42:18.660
and puts the guests at the forefront of everything the brand does.

42:18.660 --> 42:21.660
I feel pampered in this Burger King tonight.

42:21.660 --> 42:25.660
In a partnership, in a partnership with our new creative agency,

42:25.660 --> 42:29.660
OKRP, it's OKRP.

42:29.660 --> 42:31.660
We've developed a simple and meaningful articulation

42:31.660 --> 42:33.660
of how Burger King celebrates our guests.

42:33.660 --> 42:36.660
It embodies our purpose, embraces individuality,

42:36.660 --> 42:38.660
and elevates have it your way.

42:38.660 --> 42:41.660
Something our brand has always been known for.

42:41.660 --> 42:49.660
OKRP is the review we get most often on Adventure Zone on iTunes.

42:49.660 --> 42:52.660
It's fucking mean. Yeah.

42:52.660 --> 42:56.660
Now, I know there's this.

42:56.660 --> 42:57.660
Here's the quote.

42:57.660 --> 43:04.660
Advertising at its best is this is most relevant.

43:04.660 --> 43:07.660
I feel like Don Draper is click clicking through a slide.

43:07.660 --> 43:08.660
Yeah.

43:08.660 --> 43:12.660
So when you celebrate them first, not the brand.

43:12.660 --> 43:14.660
And that's just what we love about you rule.

43:14.660 --> 43:19.660
It invites people in with an approach that recognizes their world,

43:19.660 --> 43:21.660
not just sell some stuff.

43:21.660 --> 43:22.660
That's great.

43:22.660 --> 43:23.660
Now, OK.

43:23.660 --> 43:26.660
Now, we're given that this one's pretty rough.

43:26.660 --> 43:29.660
We're giving them permission to feel like winners.

43:29.660 --> 43:32.660
Holy shit.

43:32.660 --> 43:35.660
So they know what they're doing because I was about to say

43:35.660 --> 43:38.660
have it your way reflects on the eating experience.

43:38.660 --> 43:40.660
But you rules just like, hey.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.660
Hey, man.

43:42.660 --> 43:47.660
We're we are giving them permission to feel like winners with Burger King

43:47.660 --> 43:51.660
as just a small award that makes their day a bit better.

43:51.660 --> 43:52.660
Hey, Burger King.

43:52.660 --> 43:54.660
Congrats on the self-awareness.

43:54.660 --> 43:58.660
That's a huge first step.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.660
This is going to make your day.

43:59.660 --> 44:00.660
Is it going to fix everything?

44:00.660 --> 44:02.660
Nope. Nope. Nope.

44:02.660 --> 44:03.660
We'll win, though.

44:03.660 --> 44:04.660
Little W for the.

44:04.660 --> 44:07.660
You know that this isn't a healthy, responsible choice.

44:07.660 --> 44:09.660
This is the little win.

44:09.660 --> 44:10.660
And let's face it.

44:10.660 --> 44:12.660
The song is irresistible.

44:12.660 --> 44:16.660
What the song is irresistible.

44:16.660 --> 44:17.660
We're hoping it'll be the earworm.

44:17.660 --> 44:19.660
You can't shake off.

44:19.660 --> 44:22.660
And that's my gift to you, Detroit.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.660
Paul, Bud, let's bump it.

44:24.660 --> 44:31.660
I do things the way I want to do them.

44:31.660 --> 44:33.660
Make my own rules and listen to them.

44:33.660 --> 44:38.660
Won't let anyone go and rain on my parade.

44:38.660 --> 44:40.660
I think I want a flame grill, classical whopper.

44:40.660 --> 44:42.660
Sure does sound fantastic.

44:42.660 --> 44:43.660
I tell them how I want to have it.

44:43.660 --> 44:46.660
They say, OK.

44:46.660 --> 44:52.660
You rule your seasons a day at BK.

44:52.660 --> 44:54.660
Have it your way.

44:54.660 --> 44:55.660
You rule.

44:55.660 --> 44:57.660
If I want it special, we're just playing.

44:57.660 --> 44:59.660
The choice I make is my domain.

44:59.660 --> 45:02.660
With every order, I can reign and have them my way.

45:02.660 --> 45:03.660
Tall burgers.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.660
The BK menu makes sure my stomach prospers.

45:05.660 --> 45:07.660
Onion rings, chicken fries, and whopper.

45:07.660 --> 45:10.660
Any food I think is proper, I can have it my way.

45:10.660 --> 45:11.660
Get off the table.

45:11.660 --> 45:14.660
You rule your seasons a day at BK.

45:14.660 --> 45:17.660
I just can't stop dancing, Justin.

45:17.660 --> 45:19.660
Have it your way.

45:19.660 --> 45:21.660
You rule.

45:21.660 --> 45:22.660
All right.

45:22.660 --> 45:23.660
Right?

45:23.660 --> 45:25.660
It's good.

45:25.660 --> 45:26.660
It's really good.

45:26.660 --> 45:27.660
That's all.

45:27.660 --> 45:28.660
I just like the song.

45:28.660 --> 45:29.660
I thought you'd like to hear it.

45:29.660 --> 45:30.660
And it speaks to the youth.

45:30.660 --> 45:31.660
That's the important thing.

45:31.660 --> 45:32.660
I think if I walk.

45:32.660 --> 45:34.660
They love chicken fries.

45:34.660 --> 45:37.660
If I walk into a fucking Burger King and I say,

45:37.660 --> 45:40.660
I would like the chicken fries value combo special meal,

45:40.660 --> 45:41.660
please.

45:41.660 --> 45:43.660
And then they're like, that's $4.89.

45:43.660 --> 45:47.660
And then I'm like, I am not going to pay.

45:47.660 --> 45:52.660
Because I have very recently been informed I'm in charge.

45:52.660 --> 45:54.660
I'm the Burger King now, dog.

45:54.660 --> 45:55.660
I know what you're wondering.

45:55.660 --> 45:57.660
Why did I walk inside of a Burger King?

45:57.660 --> 46:00.660
And it's because I'm claiming this Burger King for myself now.

46:00.660 --> 46:03.660
You should have to assassinate the Burger King

46:03.660 --> 46:06.660
when you walk into every Burger King.

46:06.660 --> 46:07.660
Yeah.

46:07.660 --> 46:09.660
Why did you do that?

46:09.660 --> 46:11.660
I rule now.

46:11.660 --> 46:12.660
I rule.

46:12.660 --> 46:13.660
I rule.

46:13.660 --> 46:14.660
I have something of my own.

46:14.660 --> 46:19.660
Give me chicken fries until I tell you to stop.

46:19.660 --> 46:20.660
I've had three of them.

46:20.660 --> 46:21.660
Stop.

46:21.660 --> 46:22.660
Stop.

46:22.660 --> 46:23.660
I'll ask the king.

46:23.660 --> 46:26.660
The king is dead.

46:26.660 --> 46:27.660
I'm your king.

46:27.660 --> 46:28.660
I'm the king now.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.660
That's your Munch Squad for this week.

46:30.660 --> 46:31.660
Thank you so much.

46:31.660 --> 46:37.660
Should we turn it to some audience questions?

46:37.660 --> 46:38.660
Yes, we should.

46:38.660 --> 46:41.660
We received some questions from the audience.

46:41.660 --> 46:45.660
We are going to call you down and just approach the mic.

46:45.660 --> 46:46.660
It's here.

46:46.660 --> 46:47.660
Center stage.

46:47.660 --> 46:50.660
It is facing us, but you don't have to use it that way.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.660
Please turn it so you're looking at us.

46:52.660 --> 46:54.660
Please turn it so you're looking at us.

46:54.660 --> 46:56.660
Yeah, that would be fantastic, actually.

46:56.660 --> 46:57.660
Hello.

46:57.660 --> 46:58.660
Hi.

46:58.660 --> 46:59.660
My name is Luke.

46:59.660 --> 47:00.660
Hey, Luke.

47:00.660 --> 47:01.660
Nice to see him.

47:01.660 --> 47:02.660
Hi, Luke.

47:02.660 --> 47:03.660
What's your question?

47:03.660 --> 47:04.660
So I'm an OB doctor.

47:04.660 --> 47:05.660
I deliver babies.

47:05.660 --> 47:06.660
Yeah.

47:06.660 --> 47:07.660
Nice.

47:07.660 --> 47:08.660
Nice.

47:08.660 --> 47:10.660
Like the person who delivers pizzas.

47:10.660 --> 47:11.660
We get it.

47:11.660 --> 47:12.660
Right.

47:12.660 --> 47:13.660
Yeah.

47:13.660 --> 47:14.660
Yeah.

47:14.660 --> 47:18.660
Very often babies are born that don't have names, and occasionally the parents will ask

47:18.660 --> 47:21.660
me what my name is, and it's always a little awkward.

47:21.660 --> 47:25.180
I don't know if I should say my real name or if I should give a fake name because I

47:25.180 --> 47:27.180
don't want the baby to steal my name.

47:27.180 --> 47:28.180
Sure, yeah.

47:28.180 --> 47:29.180
Yeah.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.180
No, no, no.

47:30.180 --> 47:33.180
The baby is like could be a Baba Yaga who's going to steal-

47:33.180 --> 47:34.180
Thank you.

47:34.180 --> 47:35.180
Then have power over you.

47:35.180 --> 47:38.180
Does the parent say it like this?

47:38.180 --> 47:39.180
I don't have a name.

47:39.180 --> 47:40.180
What's your name?

47:40.180 --> 47:41.180
Hey.

47:41.180 --> 47:42.180
Like how do you breathe?

47:42.180 --> 47:43.180
Like I don't understand.

47:43.180 --> 47:46.180
That's a risky gambit because you could, I'll say this.

47:46.180 --> 47:49.180
Luke, fantastic name, could have a really shitty name.

47:49.180 --> 47:50.180
Like Griffin.

47:50.180 --> 47:52.180
No, that's, Griffin's good.

47:52.180 --> 47:55.180
I think it would be kind of cool to know that your name says wonder.

47:55.180 --> 47:57.180
I bet I could make myself cry on stage right now.

47:57.180 --> 48:02.180
I think it would be kind of cool to know that your namesake is out there wandering around.

48:02.180 --> 48:08.180
Like sometime you might see them, just look them in the eye and say, Luke, I am your doctor.

48:08.180 --> 48:13.180
Justin, that was, no, no, no, no, no.

48:13.180 --> 48:22.180
You, you crept toward the line, the precipice and you peeked over it, which I applaud you

48:22.180 --> 48:23.180
for.

48:23.180 --> 48:24.180
It's very brave.

48:24.180 --> 48:26.180
You did make a Star Wars joke on stage.

48:26.180 --> 48:28.180
Right, but it's tasteful.

48:28.180 --> 48:31.180
And that's why I'll say this gang.

48:31.180 --> 48:35.180
He could have made that joke at any show and not, it wasn't just for your benefit.

48:35.180 --> 48:37.180
It just happened to be right.

48:37.180 --> 48:41.180
This is how recently I was talking with my daughters and they're both named after people.

48:41.180 --> 48:43.180
And then BB said, who are you named after?

48:43.180 --> 48:44.180
And I go, I don't know.

48:44.180 --> 48:45.180
No one.

48:45.180 --> 48:48.180
And like my parents threw a dart at a board and picked traffic.

48:48.180 --> 48:49.180
I don't know.

48:49.180 --> 48:55.180
I think the being named after someone, even if I think being named after the doctor, imagine

48:55.180 --> 49:00.180
if in like 10 years, it's like the most popular kid name, Luke.

49:00.180 --> 49:01.180
And it's because of you.

49:01.180 --> 49:04.180
I don't know how many babies you're delivering in a given day.

49:04.180 --> 49:07.180
Is it enough to move the needle statistics wise?

49:07.180 --> 49:08.180
Start insisting.

49:08.180 --> 49:10.180
Hey, do you have a baby name picked out?

49:10.180 --> 49:11.180
Don't even answer.

49:11.180 --> 49:12.180
It's Luke.

49:12.180 --> 49:13.180
Next.

49:13.180 --> 49:17.180
Nurse, write down Luke.

49:17.180 --> 49:22.180
Nurse, you misspelled Luke.

49:22.180 --> 49:29.180
Does that, does that help Luke?

49:29.180 --> 49:30.180
Yeah.

49:30.180 --> 49:31.180
Thank you, brothers.

49:31.180 --> 49:32.180
You're very welcome.

49:32.180 --> 49:35.180
Thank you for joining us.

49:35.180 --> 49:39.180
Next approach the crucible.

49:39.180 --> 49:40.180
So I am Phil.

49:40.180 --> 49:43.180
What is your, your question?

49:43.180 --> 49:44.180
How can we help?

49:44.180 --> 49:50.180
So my wife's fire department is hiring and they've had a few too many recruits who have

49:50.180 --> 49:56.180
shown up taking pictures in all the gear with all the equipment and then left.

49:56.180 --> 49:57.180
Yeah.

49:57.180 --> 49:59.180
That happened with us and the fourth brother.

49:59.180 --> 50:00.180
No, I get it.

50:00.180 --> 50:01.180
Yeah, I get it.

50:01.180 --> 50:02.180
Yeah.

50:02.180 --> 50:09.180
So how can she recruit new firefighters that are interested in more than just a few good

50:09.180 --> 50:10.180
Instagram pictures?

50:10.180 --> 50:14.180
Well, welcome to the biggest problem we have on earth.

50:14.180 --> 50:15.180
Yeah.

50:15.180 --> 50:16.180
How to fight off people.

50:16.180 --> 50:17.180
It is.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.180
It is.

50:18.180 --> 50:19.180
I appreciate your help.

50:19.180 --> 50:21.180
How to fight off Instagram influencer.

50:21.180 --> 50:25.180
Yeah, it's firefighter stolen valor is probably our biggest issue.

50:25.180 --> 50:29.180
I think they have to fight one before they can do a picture.

50:29.180 --> 50:31.180
If it's your first one other firefighter.

50:31.180 --> 50:32.180
Yeah.

50:32.180 --> 50:33.180
You have to fight.

50:33.180 --> 50:36.180
No, I'm a firefighter fighter.

50:36.180 --> 50:38.180
If, listen, here's what I'm saying.

50:38.180 --> 50:44.180
If I'm going to take it from one of the other ones, our volunteer and professional firefighters,

50:44.180 --> 50:45.180
they're heroes, right?

50:45.180 --> 50:51.180
If I'm going to get a picture of myself, I want one of me doing the fighting of a fire.

50:51.180 --> 50:56.180
Like if I'm going to get one picture, I want it to look cool like I'm doing the fire stuff.

50:56.180 --> 50:59.180
Otherwise, I was just really good at ordering costumes.

50:59.180 --> 51:00.180
Yeah, right.

51:00.180 --> 51:01.180
I want to get one.

51:01.180 --> 51:02.180
One under the belt.

51:02.180 --> 51:03.180
Yeah.

51:03.180 --> 51:05.180
One where a fire is going.

51:05.180 --> 51:10.180
I don't know how you guarantee that, though, without arson.

51:10.180 --> 51:11.180
Well, okay.

51:11.180 --> 51:14.180
I was going to say you could start fires anywhere, but then that's arson.

51:14.180 --> 51:16.180
Yeah, it's fucked up, isn't it?

51:16.180 --> 51:18.180
I hate that they-

51:18.180 --> 51:19.180
That sucks.

51:19.180 --> 51:20.180
That's illegal.

51:20.180 --> 51:21.180
Hey, guys, let's grow up.

51:21.180 --> 51:23.180
Arson is generally frowned upon, yeah.

51:23.180 --> 51:25.180
Does she ever pressure you to join?

51:25.180 --> 51:26.180
She does actually.

51:26.180 --> 51:28.180
She doesn't want me to because that's her thing.

51:28.180 --> 51:32.180
Yeah, but you do look like you have beat a fire's ass, Phil.

51:32.180 --> 51:34.180
She's way tougher than I am.

51:34.180 --> 51:37.180
Does she ever look at a picture of a fire in the paper and be like, dang, Phil, wish

51:37.180 --> 51:39.180
somebody had gotten there, huh?

51:39.180 --> 51:42.180
I want you to know, Phil, I don't want you to be a firefighter.

51:42.180 --> 51:43.180
Yeah.

51:43.180 --> 51:46.180
You seem very blasé about it.

51:46.180 --> 51:50.180
I'm just saying it's not a quality I look for in a firefighter.

51:50.180 --> 51:53.180
I don't want firefighters like, yeah, okay.

51:53.180 --> 51:57.180
You seem like you-

51:57.180 --> 52:00.180
You seem like you-

52:00.180 --> 52:04.180
When pressed, you might actually join the fire.

52:04.180 --> 52:09.180
It's making some good points.

52:09.180 --> 52:14.180
Oh, no, this new firefighter recruit we got just became more fire.

52:14.180 --> 52:18.180
Yeah, but I'm just saying, did you see some of the political signs that the House had?

52:18.180 --> 52:20.180
That's the opposite of what we wanted.

52:20.180 --> 52:24.180
The media has misrepresented the fire in a pretty major way, okay?

52:24.180 --> 52:26.180
If you take the time-

52:26.180 --> 52:32.180
That fire makes some good points on its Twitter.

52:32.180 --> 52:36.180
Does that help, Phil?

52:36.180 --> 52:37.180
We'll go with yes.

52:37.180 --> 52:38.180
Yeah, sure.

52:38.180 --> 52:39.180
Okay, yeah, thanks, Phil.

52:39.180 --> 52:40.180
Thank you, brothers.

52:40.180 --> 52:45.180
See you, bud.

52:45.180 --> 52:47.180
Hello.

52:47.180 --> 52:48.180
How's it going?

52:48.180 --> 52:49.180
Hi, I'm Bell.

52:49.180 --> 52:50.180
My pronouns are she, her.

52:50.180 --> 52:51.180
Hi, Bell.

52:51.180 --> 52:54.180
As per my email, I run a LARP-

52:54.180 --> 53:00.180
Chill my last up my spine, Bell.

53:00.180 --> 53:01.180
All right.

53:01.180 --> 53:02.180
Sorry, Bell, go ahead.

53:02.180 --> 53:04.180
I run a LARP chapter in Toledo.

53:04.180 --> 53:12.180
I've been trying to get more people to join my part, but the Venn diagram of dorks who want to sword fight

53:12.180 --> 53:17.180
and people who want to go out to a park on every afternoon of every Saturday, it's kind of slim.

53:17.180 --> 53:18.180
Sure.

53:18.180 --> 53:19.180
Right?

53:19.180 --> 53:20.180
How do I get more people to join?

53:20.180 --> 53:21.180
How many do you need?

53:21.180 --> 53:23.180
I'll take as many as I can.

53:23.180 --> 53:26.180
Yeah, I mean, Travis, the answer to that question is two.

53:26.180 --> 53:28.180
Just have a bucket, just like nonstop.

53:28.180 --> 53:30.180
Well, okay, you say sword fighting.

53:30.180 --> 53:31.180
Yeah.

53:31.180 --> 53:35.180
I think there's a lot of other things going on in a given village.

53:35.180 --> 53:36.180
Sure.

53:36.180 --> 53:40.180
That you could be like, hey, do you want to sleep but in old-timey clothes?

53:40.180 --> 53:41.180
Yeah.

53:41.180 --> 53:45.180
Yeah, or we teach a lot of craft stuff.

53:45.180 --> 53:46.180
Alchemy.

53:46.180 --> 53:47.180
Leatherworking, sewing, stuff like that.

53:47.180 --> 53:48.180
Yes.

53:48.180 --> 53:49.180
Alchemy, sure.

53:49.180 --> 53:52.180
Rune crafting.

53:52.180 --> 53:56.180
I say this as someone who is now 39 and I have no idea what the answer to this is.

53:56.180 --> 53:59.180
Is that something that looks good on a college application?

53:59.180 --> 54:00.180
Rune crafting?

54:00.180 --> 54:01.180
Yeah, for sure.

54:01.180 --> 54:02.180
Yeah, absolutely.

54:02.180 --> 54:07.180
I know people at the park they started back in Texas that will actually have like, yeah,

54:07.180 --> 54:10.180
I've organized all kinds of events like on their resume and it looks good because it

54:10.180 --> 54:12.180
shows that you know how to like organize stuff.

54:12.180 --> 54:13.180
For sure.

54:13.180 --> 54:15.180
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

54:15.180 --> 54:17.180
You don't need to recruit people.

54:17.180 --> 54:22.180
You need to go to a busier park and then everyone there is here.

54:22.180 --> 54:23.180
Yeah.

54:23.180 --> 54:25.180
Listen, I will say this.

54:25.180 --> 54:29.180
You hit someone enough times the foam sword, something's going to happen.

54:29.180 --> 54:30.180
Yeah, that's great.

54:30.180 --> 54:32.180
A battle will ensue.

54:32.180 --> 54:33.180
That's great.

54:33.180 --> 54:40.180
If you throw them a foam sword and then you start hitting them ferociously with a foam

54:40.180 --> 54:44.180
sword, you have made a larper.

54:44.180 --> 54:45.180
Yeah.

54:45.180 --> 54:47.180
Been learned to defend thyself.

54:47.180 --> 54:52.180
They may not stop when you blow the whistle or whatever it is.

54:52.180 --> 54:55.180
The ocarina.

54:55.180 --> 55:01.180
There will be a role that is being played in a live action setting.

55:01.180 --> 55:03.180
So very true.

55:03.180 --> 55:05.180
I mean, how many people?

55:05.180 --> 55:07.180
How far is Toledo from here?

55:07.180 --> 55:08.180
That's about an hour's drive.

55:08.180 --> 55:09.180
How many people here?

55:09.180 --> 55:10.180
Hold on.

55:10.180 --> 55:12.180
How many people here live in Toledo?

55:12.180 --> 55:17.180
I think your group probably expanded by at least one to two people tonight if I was

55:17.180 --> 55:18.180
guessing.

55:18.180 --> 55:20.180
How can they join the group?

55:20.180 --> 55:25.180
I have a Facebook group called Bright River.

55:25.180 --> 55:28.180
We meet on Wildwood every Saturday at two.

55:28.180 --> 55:29.180
This is it.

55:29.180 --> 55:31.180
We're turning this show into Craigslist.

55:31.180 --> 55:32.180
I love it.

55:32.180 --> 55:33.180
Thank you, Belle.

55:33.180 --> 55:34.180
Does that help?

55:34.180 --> 55:35.180
I know it helps.

55:35.180 --> 55:36.180
That absolutely helps.

55:36.180 --> 55:37.180
Thank you so much, brothers.

55:37.180 --> 55:39.180
Thank you.

55:39.180 --> 55:40.180
Hello.

55:40.180 --> 55:41.180
Hello.

55:41.180 --> 55:42.180
Hello.

55:42.180 --> 55:43.180
Who are you?

55:43.180 --> 55:44.180
I'm Rebecca.

55:44.180 --> 55:45.180
Hi, Rebecca.

55:45.180 --> 55:46.180
First of all, Primo Merch.

55:46.180 --> 55:48.180
Fantastic 100% podcast.

55:48.180 --> 55:49.180
Thank you.

55:49.180 --> 55:51.180
It's the funniest thing we will ever do.

55:51.180 --> 55:54.180
It's the only T-shirt of our merch that my wife wears.

55:54.180 --> 55:55.180
Yeah.

55:55.180 --> 55:56.180
It's very good.

55:56.180 --> 55:57.180
Okay.

55:57.180 --> 55:58.180
Sorry.

55:58.180 --> 55:59.180
What's your question?

55:59.180 --> 56:01.180
So, I recently got an e-scooter.

56:01.180 --> 56:02.180
Yes.

56:02.180 --> 56:03.180
Nice.

56:03.180 --> 56:08.460
I'm wondering when I see other people out in the world on their e-scooters how I should

56:08.460 --> 56:09.460
greet them.

56:09.460 --> 56:13.780
Yeah, sure.

56:13.780 --> 56:18.380
When you say e-scooter, this isn't like, I'm sorry, lime or like that kind of thing.

56:18.380 --> 56:19.380
Like you.

56:19.380 --> 56:20.380
You own this shit.

56:20.380 --> 56:21.380
I own it.

56:21.380 --> 56:22.380
Yeah.

56:22.380 --> 56:23.380
You customize it?

56:23.380 --> 56:24.380
You put a hemi on that bad boy?

56:24.380 --> 56:26.380
Or do you put just like streamers on the handlebars?

56:26.380 --> 56:29.380
You all got those scooters around here?

56:29.380 --> 56:30.380
Yeah.

56:30.380 --> 56:32.380
I know how I'm getting home tonight.

56:32.380 --> 56:33.380
Nice.

56:33.380 --> 56:34.380
Real nice.

56:34.380 --> 56:43.180
I know more than one person who has exploded their collarbone on an e-scooter.

56:43.180 --> 56:46.060
But I don't know if that's a part of the culture or not.

56:46.060 --> 56:49.900
But you like high-five collarbones in mid-air as you pass each other.

56:49.900 --> 56:54.780
Or just like when you both sound the same but just go, oh, fuck.

56:54.780 --> 56:55.780
My collarbone.

56:55.780 --> 56:56.780
Yeah.

56:56.780 --> 56:59.420
Anybody up here have any electric vehicles?

56:59.420 --> 57:01.580
I have an electronic bicycle now.

57:01.580 --> 57:05.060
How do you greet other people with an electronic bicycle?

57:05.060 --> 57:07.500
Except for running into them.

57:07.500 --> 57:12.140
I usually slow way down until they're out of line of sight.

57:12.140 --> 57:15.460
Because I think they probably know what they're doing way better than me.

57:15.460 --> 57:16.460
Okay.

57:16.460 --> 57:17.460
Can I tell you guys?

57:17.460 --> 57:21.220
So BB is dying to get a skateboard.

57:21.220 --> 57:24.580
And I've started entertaining it and said, yeah, I'll look for one that's like good for

57:24.580 --> 57:25.580
six-year-olds.

57:25.580 --> 57:30.540
And then I realized I have zero percent information on how to ride a scooter.

57:30.540 --> 57:34.540
I might have to hire somebody to teach you how to skateboard.

57:34.540 --> 57:35.540
Please record it, Travis.

57:35.540 --> 57:36.540
No.

57:36.540 --> 57:40.940
To teach my daughter how to skateboard as I stand off to the side going, you're doing

57:40.940 --> 57:41.940
great, champ.

57:41.940 --> 57:42.940
Oh, man.

57:42.940 --> 57:43.940
No.

57:43.940 --> 57:44.940
You have to do it and also record that.

57:44.940 --> 57:47.860
Because I don't want to see you be like, oh, I don't know, Christ hair.

57:47.860 --> 57:48.860
What if I'm amazing at it?

57:48.860 --> 57:49.860
What if you're really good?

57:49.860 --> 57:50.860
Do you do many tricks?

57:50.860 --> 57:51.860
Do you know many tricks?

57:51.860 --> 57:52.860
How many tricks do you know?

57:52.860 --> 57:58.500
Um, it, the scooter like fell out from under me the other day and I, I feel like I-

57:58.500 --> 57:59.500
Half?

57:59.500 --> 58:00.500
Well, no.

58:00.500 --> 58:01.500
Okay.

58:01.500 --> 58:02.500
But yeah, it's a scooter.

58:02.500 --> 58:03.500
It's an electronic scooter.

58:03.500 --> 58:04.500
That's what it, that's what they do.

58:04.500 --> 58:05.500
But you're still here.

58:05.500 --> 58:06.500
So, trick.

58:06.500 --> 58:07.500
Yeah.

58:07.500 --> 58:08.500
That's a trick.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.500
Like I landed well, I think.

58:09.500 --> 58:10.500
You defied death.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.500
Yeah, exactly.

58:11.500 --> 58:12.500
Yeah.

58:12.500 --> 58:13.500
How many times do you see someone on an electric?

58:13.500 --> 58:14.500
Actually a lot.

58:14.500 --> 58:15.500
Yeah.

58:15.500 --> 58:16.500
And I feel like I try to like, be like, yeah, another scooter.

58:16.500 --> 58:17.500
Wait, hold on.

58:17.500 --> 58:18.500
No, no, no.

58:18.500 --> 58:19.500
This is important.

58:19.500 --> 58:20.500
What's your usual?

58:20.500 --> 58:21.500
Give me, yeah.

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
What's your usual?

58:22.500 --> 58:24.500
I try, I try to be like, you know, like a little nod.

58:24.500 --> 58:25.500
Okay.

58:25.500 --> 58:30.020
Because the first thing you did for the people at home, the first thing you did when showing

58:30.020 --> 58:32.500
it was like a deep court jester bow.

58:32.500 --> 58:33.500
Yeah.

58:33.500 --> 58:36.500
And that could work.

58:36.500 --> 58:42.820
I, you're coming at this the wrong way because you're saying to us, when I see other people

58:42.820 --> 58:49.700
on e-scooters, how can I ingratiate myself and form a human bond with them and not like,

58:49.700 --> 58:53.980
how do I intimidate and scare every other person?

58:53.980 --> 58:58.660
Who dares try to grind my block?

58:58.660 --> 59:01.180
Get extremely territorial, Rebecca.

59:01.180 --> 59:02.180
Yeah.

59:02.180 --> 59:03.180
That's the first thing.

59:03.180 --> 59:06.560
If you see anyone fucking scooting in your block.

59:06.560 --> 59:08.360
You take their battery or whatever.

59:08.360 --> 59:13.020
Take their battery or whatever it is that powers those things.

59:13.020 --> 59:15.060
Wease their juice as it were.

59:15.060 --> 59:16.060
Does that help?

59:16.060 --> 59:17.060
Yeah, that's really good.

59:17.060 --> 59:18.060
Thank you, Rebecca.

59:18.060 --> 59:19.060
Thank you.

59:19.060 --> 59:20.060
Thank you.

59:20.060 --> 59:21.060
Thank you.

59:21.060 --> 59:26.860
So this is when we wrap up, if we could bring down the lights, but first I want to say our

59:26.860 --> 59:29.300
poster by Kaley Turvo.

59:29.300 --> 59:30.300
Yes.

59:30.300 --> 59:31.300
Really good.

59:31.300 --> 59:32.300
And you can buy them in the lobby.

59:32.300 --> 59:34.300
It's one of the best posters we've ever had.

59:34.300 --> 59:35.300
Sure.

59:35.300 --> 59:36.700
Upsetting in a fun, good way.

59:36.700 --> 59:38.500
But that's my whole aesthetic.

59:38.500 --> 59:39.500
Sure.

59:39.500 --> 59:40.500
Yes.

59:40.500 --> 59:41.500
Yes.

59:41.500 --> 59:42.500
So those are available.

59:42.500 --> 59:43.500
You can buy those.

59:43.500 --> 59:44.500
Limited time only.

59:44.500 --> 59:48.860
Thank you so much to the Masonic Temple here for having us and they're beautiful.

59:48.860 --> 59:49.860
You guys see these fixtures?

59:49.860 --> 59:50.860
Oh my God.

59:50.860 --> 59:51.860
Did you see these fixtures?

59:51.860 --> 59:54.860
When the lights come up later, make sure you look.

59:54.860 --> 59:56.860
I'm sure you've probably looked before.

59:56.860 --> 59:59.140
Thank you for letting us back into your city.

59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.140
Yeah.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.140
I really appreciate it.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.140
It was, there were some tense moments.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.140
Yeah.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.140
It was touch and go.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:09.540
We're supposed to do another show here at some point and then gosh dang COVID happened,

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.540
I think.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.540
Yeah.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.540
Yeah, man.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.540
Shook out.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:14.540
Anybody else?

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.540
Thanks Montane.

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:19.060
Thank you to Amanda and Rachel and Paul and our dad and Sawbones.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.060
Yeah.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.940
All of whom we couldn't do the show without.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:27.100
Thank you to Montane for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with you.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.860
Yes.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.380
And thanks to you.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.380
Thanks to you for coming, giving us a second chance.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.940
I hope we didn't fucking blow it.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:43.820
Griffin, do you have any final thoughts for everybody?

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:44.820
Yeah.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.500
Yeah, for sure.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.980
Don't say May the force be with you.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.900
No, I won't say that.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.820
But if you, hey, it's me, Griffin.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:00.100
If you say you're going to do something, then do it.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.620
Don't say you're going to try to do it.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.380
What is Justin McElroy?

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.940
No, hold on, let Griffin keep going.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.940
No, no.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:08.940
Why not try?

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.740
Because you won't do it, man.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.740
Yeah.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.860
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.060
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.060
Griffin McElroy.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.060
This has been My Brother, My Brother, My Kids, Your Dad score on the left!

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:53.060
This has been My Brother, My Brother, My Kids, Your Dad score on the left!
