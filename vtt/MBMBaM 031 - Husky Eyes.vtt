WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind on the first in line, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown...

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
Give me what I need, what do I need? Give me the turducket, let me think. Turduck, aw yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
One...

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
Three, two, one, and turducket.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Turducket. It's my brother, my brother, me.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
It's an advice show for the modern era. I am Justin McElroy here three days out from Thanksgiving, the giving of thanks.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
I am Travis McElroy, the duck in the turducken.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm Griffin McElroy, the salmonella left over in the pan.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
DJ Salmonella would be a good DJ.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
It would be. Don't you think?

01:31.000 --> 01:40.000
So, so this is an advice show for the modern era in case you're a first timer and I know we do have some listening this very week.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
So know that you are in the presence of those whose eyes, ears, hearts, mouths and throats are about to be opened to wisdom.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I don't, I didn't like that at all.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Every orifice open to wisdom.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I like this zero.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
I don't like, what we're saying is we don't have enough prongs between us to fill all the orifices with wisdom.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I do not care for this one bit.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Yeah. Do you have a crevasse that is not being filled with wisdom?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Can you feel my wisdom inside you?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
One, question one.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Don't be itchy. It's just wisdom.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
Kit writes, I recently broke up with my boyfriend and I'm in a weird situation.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
We dated four years and the thing is he still wants to be friends and I somehow do too.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
After breaking up, I naturally realized all the bad qualities he had.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
I finally realized I'm a much better person than he is, but not being friends with him seems like it'll leave a big hole in my life.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
What should I do? Is this natural?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Like I said, this is only my second breakup.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Should I just suck it up and continue to be his friend?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Says Kit.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh, friends after the breakup.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
I guess it doesn't really happen.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
Here's the thing. If you try to maintain your relationship with him right now, especially right now, you're just going to fall in the same patterns.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
You broke up for a reason.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Most of dating is spending time with each other, right?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Sure.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
In theory, yeah, it works out.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
You spend time with people. That's how you become friends.

03:13.000 --> 03:22.000
But I think that you just used a phrase that's very important to this, which is you can't think of the phrase, we should stay friends.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
You need to become friends because you're not friends right now.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Too true, and you can't do that right away.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
There's a temptation. I get it.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
They are going to leave a hole in your life, but you got to remember that that's a boyfriend shaped hole.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
It's not a him shaped hole.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
We've talked about this before.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
You don't miss the person, you miss the relationship.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
You can't just have that back by being friends.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
When did we ever talk about this before?

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Did one of us write a book called Boyfriend Shaped Hole?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
That sounds like a national bestseller waiting to happen.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
It does, right?

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
We talked about how people don't miss the person as much as they miss the relationship.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
You also need to be careful because being that close with him immediately afterwards can get in the way of you moving on.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
It can get in the way of you getting over this breakup because you're seeing him all the time and still hanging out.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
All these feelings are lingering.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Cut ties till you're ready to be friends.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
You don't suck it up.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
There's no rush on this.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Time is the most important thing.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
You really can't rush back into any kind of relationship with him.

04:40.000 --> 04:50.000
You got to figure out the two of you alone by yourselves and not together before you can really make any sort of dent in a friendship.

04:50.000 --> 05:00.000
If you're a better person than him and that sort of thing, then you probably don't need a friendship with him.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
I know that's kind of harsh, but he sucks, right?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
There are plenty of people on this planet that you can be friends with.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Like us.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
We're your new boyfriend.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, I don't know about all that.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I'm your new boyfriend.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
Justin McElroy, half-husband, half-boyfriend, all podcasts.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
So, hopefully that will be very, very helpful to you and I hope that that makes a lot of sense.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Now, we got another question coming from FormSpring.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
FormSpring, do want to remind you though, if you do use FormSpring, go ahead and throw a name in there even if it's a pseudonym.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Especially if it's a pseudonym.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Especially if it's a clever pseudonym.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
Aside from getting my sexy right, how could I parlay my relationship as the smartest guy in my high school into dating successes?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Can't.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Can't do it.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Can't do it. Gotta get rich.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Why don't you use your big brain and figure this one out by yourself there, nerdo?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Hey, boy dexter.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Hey, Quentin.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Why don't you go ahead and use your brain juice?

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Why don't you go ahead and flex that gray matter and get yourself a girlfriend?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
You're so smart.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Nerd, figure it out.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Brainiac.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
No, you can't though.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
You can't do it though.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Can't do it though.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
If girls like to be into smart guys, they wouldn't call them lonely smart guys.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Call them baseball players or something.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Unless.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Unless.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Unless.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Your school has an awesome quiz bowl team and you can take them to state.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Quiz bowl king.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I love it.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
That addendum was unnecessary because such a thing cannot, does not exist.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
You get a quiz bowl letterman's jacket.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I don't know.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Going to see the quiz bowl just really gets me quivering in my loins.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, definitely.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Just seeing them work it.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
It's like youth jeopardy.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Rock hard.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Rock hard.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Rock hard.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
If you could do a triple crown of quiz bowl champion, spelling bee winner, and mathlete

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
supreme, you've got it.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Sure.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Just wear that golden horseshoe around your neck.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yep.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
What's up?

07:10.000 --> 07:20.000
Now, the problem with this is, of course, you can't be attractive and be smart.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Not at your age.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Especially not in high school.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Nope.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Not in high school.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Now, in college.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
In college, you will find groups of equally intelligent people that you can mingle with

07:29.000 --> 07:37.000
and then you're being the leader of the pack will allow you more leverage in that department.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
But in high school, that ship sailed off.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, you are going to be, when you get to college though, you're going to be leather

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
elbow patch deep in vagina right now.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
No.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Nope.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
The only thing I can recommend right now is to try to start practicing your acerbic

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
wit.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
That way, by the time you get to college, you've got it perfected.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Where you got withering barbs lined up.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
That's the best way to go.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, wait a minute.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I mean, maybe things, it's been a while since any of us have been in high school.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Like maybe things like, you know how you enrolled in high school or been in a high

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
school kind of lurking around enrolled and taking classes in high school.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Okay.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Appropriate high school age.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
Young people always, you know, emulate the things that they're cooler, older friends

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
or friends of siblings do.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Right.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
So maybe like high school now is college for us and maybe being a, like a witty smart ass

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
is, is, you know, hot shit now.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
So what you're saying is what you're saying is now that all of us are older, too old for

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
high school, we should go back and act like we're attracted to smart guys.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
So that'll be a new thing.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Yep.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
In high school.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
That's what you're saying.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.480
You're saying all of us should get really intelligent 17 year old boyfriends.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.560
He's our new boyfriend now, not how we were his new boyfriend and he is in turn our new

09:04.560 --> 09:05.560
boyfriend.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
Is that what you're saying?

09:06.560 --> 09:08.120
I'm having a hard time keeping up.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.120
No, no.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.120
You're right on it.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.120
Okay.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
I did understand that correctly.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.440
You think we should start a new craze of being into smart guys.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.440
Yep.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.040
I'm saying keeping the smartest guy in your high school because you're gonna, it's going

09:20.040 --> 09:24.520
to pay dividends way bigger than, you know, awkward high school relationships.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.680
You're going to go to a good college, you're going to learn a lot and you know, you're

09:28.680 --> 09:31.000
just going to have, you're going to enrich yourself.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.840
And really in the end, I just finished Malcolm Gladwell's outliers like you're just, you're

09:35.840 --> 09:36.840
going to be the next Bill Gates.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.240
I can tell form spring and you got nothing to worry about.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.440
And I'm going to give just the last, last answer here.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.920
Two words.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.360
Weird science.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.360
Check it out.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.360
There it is.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.360
I'm not going to say anything else.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.680
Just check it out.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.680
Weird science.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.200
Check it out.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.520
I got a Yahoo.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
Check it off.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.920
I actually have like nine yahoo.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.200
Should we explain yahoo answers is a web service.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.880
We do not solicit these questions, but we do find them kind of.

10:01.880 --> 10:09.160
It's like kind of like a, a, um, an airdrop of wisdom that no one requested.

10:09.160 --> 10:14.920
Um, here's one that was sent in by get this Leviticus Sutherland.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.920
Yes.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.320
Have you ever heard a name cooler than that?

10:18.320 --> 10:20.760
I just choked on water.

10:20.760 --> 10:21.760
Sorry Max Jackman.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.840
You done been bumped.

10:22.840 --> 10:23.840
You got bumped.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.840
No, I'm actually cool.

10:24.840 --> 10:25.840
You're not.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.840
Could you say that name one more time?

10:28.840 --> 10:29.840
Leviticus Sutherland.

10:29.840 --> 10:30.840
Oh Jesus.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.840
He sounds like an 18th century detective.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.840
Yeah.

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
God, that's hot.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.840
I want to, I want to write a book now so I can have a lead character named that.

10:37.840 --> 10:45.520
Um, this question was asked by yahoo answers user Nat Ilf, who asked what is the heaviest

10:45.520 --> 10:47.200
Babby to ever be birthed?

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
Jesus.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.200
Really?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.200
Again with the Babby?

10:50.200 --> 10:51.200
Again with the Babby.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.200
Um, uh,

10:52.200 --> 10:53.760
fucking cut it out.

10:53.760 --> 10:59.720
Uh, she, she goes on to ask, I am pregnant due on Christmas and the doctors say my Babby

10:59.720 --> 11:01.240
is very heavy.

11:01.240 --> 11:08.600
I think they said he was going to be 175 pounds.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.960
Can I do anything to make my Babby smaller?

11:10.960 --> 11:12.880
I am really worried about the labor.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.360
Bitch, you should be.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.720
That's going to be a wicked labor.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.920
Wow.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.240
You will most certainly die.

11:21.240 --> 11:26.920
Your lower section will open up, it will bloom like a flower when you pass that 175 pound

11:26.920 --> 11:27.920
man.

11:27.920 --> 11:34.360
Let's be honest, this guy's wearing her like an inner tube right now.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.560
He's just walking around with his mom around his waist.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.560
Sure.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.940
This is, it's vulgar.

11:40.940 --> 11:42.600
He's already applying for jobs.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.600
It's pretty awful.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.600
Oh God.

11:44.600 --> 11:49.160
Is this like an early onset, early onset like Jack disease?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.360
You think that's what's going on here?

11:50.360 --> 11:53.680
You think that job market is up right now?

11:53.680 --> 11:58.360
Try going in with your mom with her skin stretched out all around your, your hands and feet.

11:58.360 --> 12:02.840
I see a human face sticking out of your chest, like through the skin.

12:02.840 --> 12:03.840
What is going on?

12:03.840 --> 12:04.840
We're both applying.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.060
We're competing.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.480
You hire both of us or you hire neither of us unless it's a very compelling offer.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.560
And then I, I, I will consider a late term abortion.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.560
You know what?

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
You know what conservatives?

12:17.560 --> 12:20.320
That is one area where if you abort a full grown man, I think I can get on board with

12:20.320 --> 12:24.280
you that that should be a crime.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.880
When does consent, when does life begin?

12:25.880 --> 12:31.000
I think once you have stubble, life is officially begun.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
At six.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah, sure.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.880
Life begins at six feet.

12:34.880 --> 12:40.200
I mean, what can the, let's, let's, let's apply some, some rationale to this.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
Okay.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
For a change.

12:42.200 --> 12:47.140
What, what the fuck kind of like miscommunication has this woman had with her doctor?

12:47.140 --> 12:51.940
Like is there another, like a metric, maybe 175 ounces, but even that, that's a hefty

12:51.940 --> 12:52.940
ass baby.

12:52.940 --> 12:53.940
Right?

12:53.940 --> 12:54.940
And nobody uses numbers like that.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.840
All I can think is like, how much is that?

12:56.840 --> 12:58.240
How much is this car weight?

12:58.240 --> 13:02.120
Like a billion grams in fluid ounces.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.600
How many, how, how big's my babe?

13:05.600 --> 13:06.780
How about this?

13:06.780 --> 13:12.880
Maybe she is pregnant, pregnant in the UK and like the doctor's bill was 175 pounds.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.880
Okay.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.120
I like, I think that that could be possible except everybody in the UK knows how to think

13:17.120 --> 13:18.120
about baby.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.120
I would imagine.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.120
Oh shit.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.800
Maybe this is a regional thing.

13:22.800 --> 13:28.040
Maybe this is like, you know, in the land of giant hours, like they spell it wrong.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.040
Right?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.040
Yeah.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
How bad?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
I don't even care about the miscommunication.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.120
Like how bad have you been at weights your whole life?

13:35.120 --> 13:40.240
You don't like that doesn't immediately like, Whoa, did you say 175?

13:40.240 --> 13:42.460
That sounds like, like a happy person.

13:42.460 --> 13:45.240
You only weigh 130 pounds.

13:45.240 --> 13:49.720
You physically can't, you physically cannot have that in you.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.600
Unless her baby is composed of black matter.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.600
Like this is my baby.

13:53.600 --> 14:01.560
Unless your baby, unless your urethra is a TARDIS, there is literally no way.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.240
It's like, no, it's like the genie bottle.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.240
You see?

14:04.240 --> 14:08.960
And I just said urethra as if that was some kind of body part that's involved in the passing

14:08.960 --> 14:10.520
of babies through humans.

14:10.520 --> 14:15.720
That is in fact like the tube that a man's urine goes out, right?

14:15.720 --> 14:16.720
Ladies have them.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.720
Don't ladies have them too?

14:17.720 --> 14:18.720
I don't know.

14:18.720 --> 14:22.720
You may know a doctor.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.800
So the urethra is where your baby is.

14:25.800 --> 14:30.440
You're going to pee out that 175 pound baby through urethra and it's going to be a worst

14:30.440 --> 14:31.440
day of your life.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.440
Yeah.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.440
Enjoy that elf.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.440
You're a dead woman.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.560
If you want to reduce the size of your 175 pound baby, just go through a narrow doorframe

14:38.560 --> 14:40.960
running really quick.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.080
Should knock something off.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.040
I think it would help.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.740
I'm in love with a girl and I've been thinking about asking her out for a while now.

14:49.740 --> 14:52.320
She is a female human, not a goose.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.880
I'm about 95% sure she loves me.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.160
So I know she'll say yes.

14:56.160 --> 15:00.200
The only problem is my friends dislike her and they think she's ugly and they don't know

15:00.200 --> 15:01.700
why I talk to her.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.720
If I, honesty, so important.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.800
If I date her, all my friends will surely give me hell about it.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.240
Do I ask her out like I want to?

15:09.240 --> 15:12.040
Do I not date her because it would make my friends happy?

15:12.040 --> 15:13.040
Help me brothers.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.040
Gmail.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
Jamal.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.040
Yep.

15:16.040 --> 15:20.560
There's, there's some problems I have with this.

15:20.560 --> 15:26.320
Some, some gaps I feel like are in the story that make it hard to give advising.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.560
He's in love with her and yet he's been thinking about asking her out.

15:30.560 --> 15:34.360
Oh, I don't know about love then.

15:34.360 --> 15:39.200
That instantly makes me think that he's like 14.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
Maybe eight.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.200
Okay.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.200
Eight years old.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.200
Let's not despair.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.200
And your friends dislike her because she has cooties.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.200
Yeah.

15:46.200 --> 15:55.800
No, I, obviously if you think there's a real chance at love, real chance, then you, you

15:55.800 --> 15:56.800
gotta take it.

15:56.800 --> 16:04.320
It's always, if there's a number one in the, in the NBNBA book of wisdom after packing

16:04.320 --> 16:08.720
bags, it's, it's if there's a chance at love, take it.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.880
But I also think, I think we have an opportunity here where we get those questions where it's

16:12.880 --> 16:15.640
like my friend just started dating a girl.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.800
She's absolutely horrible.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.160
We can't stand her.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.880
Do we like, we have a chance now to look at this from the other side of the coin and say,

16:23.880 --> 16:30.640
you know, maybe you're ignoring these things that your friends see and you're focusing

16:30.640 --> 16:35.960
on the good qualities and you need to flash forward to like three months from now where

16:35.960 --> 16:40.840
she ends every sentence with the word what, you know, and it's like, I can't stand you

16:40.840 --> 16:41.840
anymore.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.760
You're getting in on that, you're getting down on that future hypothetical time travel

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
train.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.760
Yep.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.760
I'm all about that.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.040
You're saying we can stop this problem that will be a problem in the future in the past

16:51.040 --> 16:52.560
as if we were from the future.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.760
No, I have a huge problem with this from a sustainability perspective.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.200
If people don't keep making mistakes, where do we get questions from?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.200
Okay.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.920
We can't, we can't preemptively keep people from ruining their lives.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.160
They got to ruin their lives and then come to us.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.160
That's fair.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.160
You're right.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.160
You're right.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.160
So do it.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.200
I guess what I'm saying is go for it.

17:12.200 --> 17:21.320
I think that you need to realize that you're, you're faced with either you lose this girl

17:21.320 --> 17:26.720
or you lose your friendships because you're going in, you can't not know that your friends

17:26.720 --> 17:27.720
don't like her.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.440
Like you can't ignore that from here on in.

17:29.440 --> 17:34.440
So anytime you all hang out together, you know, you, you're going to know that they

17:34.440 --> 17:37.080
don't want her there.

17:37.080 --> 17:42.020
But um, I will say that if your friends all dislike her and continue to dislike her after

17:42.020 --> 17:45.360
you date her because they think she's ugly, fuck them.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.360
Yeah.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.360
Yeah.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.360
Fuck them.

17:48.360 --> 17:53.600
But if your friends that's getting their smooch on and that's you going to smooch burg every

17:53.600 --> 17:56.940
weekend night underneath the bleachers and what are your friends doing?

17:56.940 --> 18:01.040
They're all sad reading the new Harry Potter, crying themselves to sleep.

18:01.040 --> 18:05.600
And you're getting your smooch, you're going to smooch, smoochville, getting the smooch

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
gone.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
Is that what you do in high school?

18:07.600 --> 18:08.600
Yep.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
Smooch.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.600
You smooch all the time.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.600
You become the mayor of smooch town.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.360
You become the mayor of smooch town and you get your smooch going.

18:14.360 --> 18:23.760
So I guess what we're saying is, um, smoocher, yeah, just smoocher, silly smoocher, you goose.

18:23.760 --> 18:30.400
Uh, hey brothers, hey, uh, I, I watch a lot of films and there's always someone has to

18:30.400 --> 18:34.160
ruin the experience by asking questions or trying to guess the ending.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.760
It is really annoying.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.160
So what's the best way to shut them up?

18:37.160 --> 18:38.720
God, I hate that.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.680
Oh, it makes me so angry.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.560
I wish I knew.

18:43.560 --> 18:48.280
As fun as growing up, our dad used to do this thing where he didn't guess the ending, but

18:48.280 --> 18:53.320
he would just go, ah, and nod his head about like 15 minutes into the movie.

18:53.320 --> 18:57.880
And like, I knew that he had just figured out what was going to happen 15 minutes in

18:57.880 --> 18:59.640
and I'd be sitting there going, what?

18:59.640 --> 19:00.640
What did I miss?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.640
What is it?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.640
What?

19:02.640 --> 19:05.920
Oh, and then the whole movie, I was just trying to figure out how my dad was so much smarter

19:05.920 --> 19:06.920
than I was.

19:06.920 --> 19:07.920
Yeah.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.920
Hey, it's uncanny.

19:08.920 --> 19:16.960
Um, now as far as actually, uh, God, that's so tough because it's hard to not do it and

19:16.960 --> 19:22.200
not look like a, a jerk hole to say like, excuse me, whatever you're saying, this movie

19:22.200 --> 19:27.080
is more important, but I think you have to do it once or else you're going to live your

19:27.080 --> 19:28.080
life like that.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.680
Well, and also this is really one of those, this is one of those situations that can only

19:31.680 --> 19:32.680
be fixed.

19:32.680 --> 19:39.200
I rarely, if ever condoned this, this approach, but you got to be as passive aggressive as

19:39.200 --> 19:41.280
humanly possible about it.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.080
Because if you come out, then you're a jerk who ruined movie night.

19:44.080 --> 19:52.200
Um, but if you, if you sigh like really hard when they ask questions, but not too hard,

19:52.200 --> 19:53.200
I got it.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.200
I got it.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.200
I got it.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.200
I got it.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Keep the remote control in your hand.

19:57.200 --> 20:01.280
And when, as soon as they start talking, pause it and give them their give them your full

20:01.280 --> 20:02.280
attention.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.360
Because in a movie theater, like this isn't a movie night.

20:05.360 --> 20:09.000
This is like out in public paid for a ticket movie theater.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.760
The power of a withering glance can not be ignored.

20:12.760 --> 20:17.280
Like if they're sitting right behind you, just do a slow burn around, stare them full

20:17.280 --> 20:20.360
in the face and then turn back around.

20:20.360 --> 20:27.560
Is there anything more infuriating than, than infractions on, on like movie going etiquette?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.560
No.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.440
That is the most frustrating thing on the planet.

20:30.440 --> 20:37.440
I went to see the new Harry Potter movie yesterday and sat next to, um, this irresponsibly overweight

20:37.440 --> 20:43.440
family that would like, would not budge when I had to go use the restroom.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.920
Cause that movie is four days long.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.680
Like I had to use the restroom because I'm a human and I process fluid and food through

20:48.680 --> 20:53.400
my body and sometimes I have to go through the bathroom and these fuckers like wouldn't

20:53.400 --> 20:54.680
move their legs for me.

20:54.680 --> 21:00.100
Like just looked at me, like just kept their big, horrible fat shanks.

21:00.100 --> 21:03.160
Like just sticking out in the aisle, like climb them.

21:03.160 --> 21:08.260
Like I was in fucking football training camp and then like would not stop talking throughout

21:08.260 --> 21:10.160
the movie, but not saying anything insightful.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.660
But like a character would die and they'd be like, really?

21:13.660 --> 21:16.480
What are you adding to my experience?

21:16.480 --> 21:23.120
Other than I guess increasing my dexterity by not moving your big stupid trunks, it makes,

21:23.120 --> 21:24.360
I'm still angry about it.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.840
I've been angry about it for 48 hours.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.840
Here's what you do.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.480
You're next to a fat person, shut up, just lean over halfway through the movie and say,

21:31.480 --> 21:38.860
if you say one more word, I'm going to slit your throat open and drink your neck, drink

21:38.860 --> 21:40.200
your fucking neck jelly.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.200
You weirdo.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.760
Oh God, that's irritating.

21:43.760 --> 21:51.160
I would rather, I would rather hang out with racists and people who cut line in traffic

21:51.160 --> 21:52.840
than people who talk in movie theater.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.940
It's just so clearly not what you do because it's self-centered.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.680
It's like, it's ignoring everyone else's experience.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
Yep.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.680
Exactly.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.680
Exactly.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.480
It's convincing yourself that you're the only person on earth having an experience.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.480
Cause you know it's annoying.

22:05.480 --> 22:10.080
Like there's no way you can ignore the fact that you're interrupting everyone else's experience,

22:10.080 --> 22:11.120
but you're just like, fuck it.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.400
I paid for a ticket too.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.920
Yeah, but so did all those people.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.360
You have just ruined like $20 for everyone in the theater.

22:18.360 --> 22:19.920
We're not really helping.

22:19.920 --> 22:20.920
I know.

22:20.920 --> 22:21.920
Um.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.000
We're commiserating, which is a way of helping.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It is.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.240
Sometimes it's all you need.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.240
That is annoying.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.240
You know what?

22:28.240 --> 22:31.720
If, if, if someone is talking and you can tell people around you are getting irritated,

22:31.720 --> 22:33.040
stand up and say, shut up.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.040
Yeah.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.440
We're watching a movie and you will be a hero.

22:35.440 --> 22:39.000
Cause the thing is just know that everyone in the theater is thinking the exact same

22:39.000 --> 22:43.640
thing and wishing someone would say something and, but like, everyone's like, I don't know.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.640
I don't.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.320
And if you say it, you are going to be met with silent applause.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.320
Yeah.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.320
Cause they don't want to disrupt the movie.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.320
Yeah.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.700
But then you read those, those things in the newspaper.

22:52.700 --> 22:57.480
It's like, man gets stabbed to death with like trimming, like hedge trimming scissors

22:57.480 --> 23:00.680
in a movie theater because he stood up to the theater bully.

23:00.680 --> 23:04.800
Like it happens because it's dark and anonymous and you could just, you can just stab people

23:04.800 --> 23:05.800
to death in there.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.800
And like, it doesn't matter.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.800
That's why everyone's so afraid.

23:07.800 --> 23:08.800
That's why nobody speaks up.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.600
Griffin, can I tell you something right now?

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
And you know, I love you.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.600
You're my brother, my blood.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.600
I love you.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.040
Are you going to make fun of me for saying head shearing trimmer and scissors?

23:16.040 --> 23:18.040
Cause I couldn't think of what they're called.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.040
No.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.040
I want to tell you later.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.040
Remind me after the show.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.040
I'll do that.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.040
Right now.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.760
I need to tell you that you're letting the terrorists win.

23:24.760 --> 23:25.760
Wow.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.960
But it's not terrorists, Justin.

23:27.960 --> 23:28.960
They aren't.

23:28.960 --> 23:29.960
No, they're terrorists.

23:29.960 --> 23:30.960
It's you and me.

23:30.960 --> 23:31.960
It's, it's you.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
It's not you and me.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.720
Cause obviously we have sense in our goddamn heads, but like it's people like you and me.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.040
It's Americans.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.640
People who talk in a movie theater, someone stands up to them and then they kill them.

23:41.640 --> 23:42.640
They're a terrorist.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.640
That's what they're doing.

23:43.640 --> 23:50.160
They're striking fear for all those people who, who, uh, want to talk in movie theaters.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.280
Now they get a free pass cause some dumb ass killed somebody one time.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.280
Yep.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.280
It's more than you know what?

23:55.280 --> 23:56.280
Oh shit.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.280
Equal and opposite reaction.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.280
You gotta kill somebody.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.040
Somebody for talking in a movie theater.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.840
The fear will balance out the fear.

24:01.840 --> 24:02.840
That's fair.

24:02.840 --> 24:03.840
Yeah.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.880
And I also tell you, if you do a movie night at home and you kill the first person, I guarantee

24:07.880 --> 24:10.400
you won't have that problem anymore.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.800
No more movie nights for you.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.800
Yeah.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.640
See this, this whole thing was panning for gold.

24:14.640 --> 24:18.120
You thought we weren't going to help this person when we did kill them, kill the person

24:18.120 --> 24:19.120
who talks.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.120
Yeah.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.120
Yeah.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.120
Murder time.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.120
Yeah.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.120
And nobody talks in jail in movies cause they're in the movies at jail.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.120
That's a fact.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.120
Yahoo answers.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.120
Yahoo answers.

24:27.120 --> 24:33.480
This one was sent in by Clayton A. Yahoo answers user Joe asks best for loco flavor.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.560
I feel like it's time for us to address this.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
Okay.

24:36.560 --> 24:41.800
Uh, Joe asks, so I just darn a cranberry lemonade and then a blue raspberry and then

24:41.800 --> 24:42.800
a watermelon.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.080
I'm about to drive to the store to get another.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.080
What flavor should I get?

24:47.080 --> 24:50.080
How about hospital flavor?

24:50.080 --> 24:51.080
Dead.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.080
Flavor of what?

24:52.080 --> 24:53.080
Dead.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.080
Yeah.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.080
For loco.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.080
Travis, do you not, are you not?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.080
Are you liking a bubble?

24:58.080 --> 24:59.080
What is that?

24:59.080 --> 25:01.080
Are you a bubble boy?

25:01.080 --> 25:02.080
Apparently.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.880
For loco is like, um, I don't know, locally we have sparks.

25:05.880 --> 25:06.880
I don't know if you.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.480
Oh, it's so much worse than that though.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.480
Is it worse than sparks?

25:09.480 --> 25:10.480
Yeah.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.480
It's like that.

25:11.480 --> 25:12.860
They just, the FDA just said their for loco is illegal.

25:12.860 --> 25:15.000
People call it a blackout in a can.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Oh.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Um, we make a beverage.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I don't know if we've talked about it on the show before.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.320
The trash, the trash.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.320
I'm almost afraid.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.320
I'm afraid to talk about it.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.320
Griffin.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.320
I'm afraid to unleash.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.840
I feel like we shouldn't, like we almost shouldn't talk about it because we're going

25:27.840 --> 25:32.120
to get imitators and then someone will almost certainly die and then that shit will be on

25:32.120 --> 25:33.120
us.

25:33.120 --> 25:37.960
Um, anyway, hypothetically, but not, not encouraged to do this.

25:37.960 --> 25:42.040
Don't do it at all, but it's really cheap and it gets you real fucked up.

25:42.040 --> 25:46.600
Uh, you take a 40 ounce of malt liquor, drink it to the label, refill it with an energy

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
beer and then you drink that whole thing.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.040
You drink the entire production.

25:50.040 --> 25:53.880
It costs you like $6 and six years of your life.

25:53.880 --> 25:54.880
Yeah.

25:54.880 --> 26:00.320
It, it, I, I imagine it's the same thing as a four loco, but I can't imagine anything

26:00.320 --> 26:05.920
being more, um, I don't know, horrible than a trash monkey.

26:05.920 --> 26:11.320
So that's why I don't, I don't buy into this whole four loco fervor.

26:11.320 --> 26:17.720
Let me tell you though, that a trash monkey, it sounds gross and it is, um, but I am a

26:17.720 --> 26:18.720
gentleman with a strong.

26:18.720 --> 26:19.720
Is it racist?

26:19.720 --> 26:22.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.400
It's beautiful.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.200
Um, I am a man with a strong tolerance.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.440
I can't handle two of them.

26:28.440 --> 26:31.720
Like two of them puts me on my ass.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.000
Like you only need one.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.320
It's the most beautiful drink.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.480
Don't ever drink it.

26:36.480 --> 26:37.480
Don't do it.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.480
Don't ever drink it.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.480
In fact, don't drink four loco.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.540
Don't drink Sparks.

26:40.540 --> 26:41.540
Don't drink.

26:41.540 --> 26:44.520
I've never understood the logic of an energy beer.

26:44.520 --> 26:49.080
Like man, I don't want to get real fucked up and also real coherent.

26:49.080 --> 26:55.720
I like the thing about it is that your body has one defense against not drinking itself

26:55.720 --> 26:58.040
to death and that's sleepy time.

26:58.040 --> 27:03.720
It's your, it's your body say wrestling you to the ground saying, all right, dummy, we're

27:03.720 --> 27:04.720
done.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.720
The night is over.

27:05.720 --> 27:10.760
And four loco like disengages that whole situation.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.040
It's taking the safety off.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.040
Yeah.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.040
It's not good.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.640
You know what else disengages that whole situation?

27:15.640 --> 27:16.640
Cocaine.

27:16.640 --> 27:22.440
Like this, it's six in one half dozen in the other, except one has kind of a fun name.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.440
That's true.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.840
Like cocaine is a fun name.

27:25.840 --> 27:26.840
It is a fun name.

27:26.840 --> 27:27.840
It's fun to say.

27:27.840 --> 27:33.000
I'm going to drink just, I think that you guys need to start taking care of yourselves

27:33.000 --> 27:35.920
and by you guys, I mean anyone's who's ever drank a four loco.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.300
You're better than that.

27:37.300 --> 27:38.300
You're better than that.

27:38.300 --> 27:46.080
Like drinking is such a wonderful experience that that is classy and like, I feel like

27:46.080 --> 27:49.720
this is the complete like opposite of classy.

27:49.720 --> 27:54.720
Sometimes things go bad when you're drinking all night and it's like, oh man, that didn't

27:54.720 --> 27:55.720
go so well.

27:55.720 --> 27:56.720
Most of them you have a great experience.

27:56.720 --> 28:04.920
You have a bad experience, but like four loco is like actively saying like, this is going

28:04.920 --> 28:05.920
to be a disaster.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.920
Like this is going to be a wreck.

28:06.920 --> 28:07.920
This is going to be a bad night.

28:07.920 --> 28:12.560
It seems like the kind of thing that if you were with a friend, they should be honor bound

28:12.560 --> 28:14.560
to smack it out of your hand.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.560
Yeah.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.960
Don't let your friends, don't let friends drink.

28:17.960 --> 28:18.960
Four loco.

28:18.960 --> 28:19.960
Four loco.

28:19.960 --> 28:20.960
They stop them.

28:20.960 --> 28:21.960
Unless they're like party friends.

28:21.960 --> 28:22.960
Unless they want to get down.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.520
Like if you want to get down, if you want to get down, fuck it.

28:26.520 --> 28:30.640
Let's do some whippets and headbutt each other, but like let's not waste money on four loco.

28:30.640 --> 28:35.040
Let's fucking put some football helmets on and hit each other with bowling pins to mix

28:35.040 --> 28:36.040
it up.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.040
Yeah.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.040
Chop it out.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.040
And do whippets.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.040
God damn it.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.040
I need a whippet right now.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
How about instead of a whippet.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.040
Why do you want a dog?

28:43.040 --> 28:44.160
I can give you a question.

28:44.160 --> 28:47.480
Many of our good friends have been getting engaged recently.

28:47.480 --> 28:51.840
I'm happy for them, but the idea of being engaged right now really freaks me out.

28:51.840 --> 28:57.040
I'm in a relationship and my boyfriend has started talking about us getting engaged.

28:57.040 --> 29:02.000
I've explained my commitment phobia, but I fear he will ask soon anyway.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
That's real love.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I love him.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
So I should.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.880
Should I say yes, even though I'm terrified?

29:08.880 --> 29:09.880
Potential runaway bride.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.880
Gmail.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.000
Oh, that's good.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.400
That's encouraging.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.160
This question confuses me.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.160
What's that?

29:17.160 --> 29:25.160
Well, just because, like, it seems like she doesn't understand the commitment she's making

29:25.160 --> 29:27.320
while stating she's afraid of commitment.

29:27.320 --> 29:31.480
Like if he asked, should I just say yes, even though I don't really want to know.

29:31.480 --> 29:35.680
It's a pretty big deal to say, yeah, like you fully shouldn't do that.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.080
Like, yeah, definitely not that.

29:39.080 --> 29:43.080
It's not like a placeholder bookmark that you can back out of later, you know, just

29:43.080 --> 29:44.500
like, yes.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.560
She's not saying she doesn't want to, though.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.900
She's saying she's terrified.

29:47.900 --> 29:51.600
You can be terrified of things that are good for you, like the dentist.

29:51.600 --> 29:56.320
I think you need to walk this whole idea back and figure out what it is that's scaring you

29:56.320 --> 29:57.600
so much.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.600
Because you know what?

29:58.600 --> 30:05.040
It may be that you just, I'm not going to cast aspersions on your relationship.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.100
This person may be great.

30:06.100 --> 30:10.840
It may be that you're not looking forward to spending a lifetime with them.

30:10.840 --> 30:11.840
That may not be it.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.720
There are many reasons you could be terrified.

30:13.720 --> 30:21.360
But just to be sort of randomly terrified of it, like to just be scared of commitment

30:21.360 --> 30:27.160
without a real reason to, may mean that there's something else going on in there, in the old

30:27.160 --> 30:28.160
heart.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.160
What if it's simpler than that?

30:29.160 --> 30:30.720
What if she just sees her friends getting engaged?

30:30.720 --> 30:35.720
A great deal of my friends have gotten engaged this past year, like a lot of them.

30:35.720 --> 30:39.640
I would say probably 90% of my high school graduating class.

30:39.640 --> 30:46.280
And I see them together, I'm like, that's such a wicked bad idea.

30:46.280 --> 30:51.520
Not the idea of getting engaged in general, but just you two together, nuh-uh.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.360
The worst idea.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.520
So maybe you're afraid that people will look at you like that, or maybe you're all afraid

30:57.520 --> 31:00.140
you'll be like that.

31:00.140 --> 31:05.080
Which I guess makes sense, you just got to be confident in your own and what you got

31:05.080 --> 31:07.560
going and can't compare it to your friends.

31:07.560 --> 31:10.560
I would say don't let that factor into it at all.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.220
Don't let the idea that all of your friends are getting engaged, don't let that.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.640
That has absolutely no bearing on your situation.

31:16.640 --> 31:21.640
I think step one is you need to talk to your boyfriend and be like, hey, straight up, remember

31:21.640 --> 31:25.200
two weeks ago when I said that I wasn't ready to get engaged?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.580
Keep that in mind, that hasn't changed.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.640
That is not something you need to bring up again right now.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.720
I'll let you know when the time is right, but it is not now.

31:32.720 --> 31:39.800
This is one of those weird situations where you having that fear should sort of preclude

31:39.800 --> 31:43.360
the discussion.

31:43.360 --> 31:47.720
If you're terrified of commitment and you express this to your BF and he still asks

31:47.720 --> 31:53.360
you to get married, that may not be, he may not be ready.

31:53.360 --> 31:58.440
That may not be the relationship you need to be in, because that's like, it's hard

31:58.440 --> 31:59.440
being married.

31:59.440 --> 32:04.120
Even if you love each other, it's tough, and that's not a good start to say, I really

32:04.120 --> 32:05.120
don't want to do this.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.120
Well, I do, so now you have to.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.200
That's not a good start.

32:09.200 --> 32:16.280
And plus, if neither of you are going anywhere, he might, here's probably what happened.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.280
Everyone was getting engaged.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.360
He brought up the idea of being engaged.

32:19.360 --> 32:24.200
You backed off a little bit, so now he's even more freaked out, so he's trying to hold

32:24.200 --> 32:25.760
on tighter.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.640
He might force the issue because he's afraid of losing you, because all of a sudden you

32:29.640 --> 32:33.880
weren't so down with the idea of being engaged, so you probably just need to make it clear

32:33.880 --> 32:38.540
to him that it's not a reflection of the relationship between you two.

32:38.540 --> 32:42.760
It's you and it's issues you have to work out on your own, so that he's not freaked

32:42.760 --> 32:43.760
out.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.440
Yeah, I sense from this email that you guys love each other.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.440
I can tell that.

32:47.440 --> 32:52.920
I sense a love there, but it sounds like you guys are one good long conversation away from

32:52.920 --> 32:55.260
getting this sorted out.

32:55.260 --> 33:01.200
It's like a convo needs to take place.

33:01.200 --> 33:05.520
If it's not going to work out, there's always Griffin.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.360
I can give you his phone number.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.680
He's super nice.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.960
Please ladies.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.960
Ripe for the picking.

33:11.960 --> 33:12.960
Ripe for the picking.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.880
Like a delicious cherry.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.440
One might even say over-ripe.

33:16.440 --> 33:25.280
One might say he's developed some tendencies during his year of solitude that maybe are

33:25.280 --> 33:26.280
not so attractive.

33:26.280 --> 33:30.680
Maybe a few bruises on the fruit.

33:30.680 --> 33:39.640
Maybe my rind is a little moldy, figuratively and literally.

33:39.640 --> 33:40.640
Ladies are guys.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.640
Ladies.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.640
Line forms to the left.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.280
Yeah, I'm not so picky anymore.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.280
Just anybody.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.840
Just take him.

33:46.840 --> 33:47.840
Matchmaker.

33:47.840 --> 33:48.840
Matchmaker.

33:48.840 --> 33:52.760
Hey, I need some advice on saving money.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.800
You've come to the right place.

33:54.800 --> 34:02.440
Every time I get my allowance, I feel the urge to go buy something fabulous and amazing

34:02.440 --> 34:03.480
that I want.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.160
Not necessarily need.

34:05.160 --> 34:14.280
Any tips that will result in the least amount of tears or tears tears because if it's tears

34:14.280 --> 34:22.080
buy high-quality garments because that sure otherwise tears thanks grace form spring here's

34:22.080 --> 34:28.240
a mbnbm rule to live by if you are still getting allowance you don't have to be worried about

34:28.240 --> 34:34.400
saving that is correct um in fact you don't have to worry about shit everything's awesome

34:34.400 --> 34:37.920
you're eight just chill for a while just chill out you don't need to say you know i would

34:37.920 --> 34:43.640
do if i was eight and didn't have a job or like any sort of uh things to worry about

34:43.640 --> 34:48.040
i'm just like sitting in a bath all day let's go sit in a bath all day that's have you thought

34:48.040 --> 34:52.440
about grace have you thought about just chilling in a bath you know what i would do with my

34:52.440 --> 34:57.480
allowance if i was eight high rate mutual fund yeah yeah yeah definitely an investment

34:57.480 --> 35:02.000
down on ira you're never too young never too young grace i don't think you're eight but

35:02.000 --> 35:06.200
i seriously this is not a joke if you're getting allowance you don't need to worry about saving

35:06.200 --> 35:12.560
you need to blow it buy some like on whippets you're young you'll recover eight i started

35:12.560 --> 35:17.760
whippets when i was eight yeah wait unless you're trying to save up for like some awesome

35:17.760 --> 35:22.800
purchase like you're saving up to buy a tv for your room or something no fuck it no fuck

35:22.800 --> 35:26.120
it because you could wait 10 weeks and get that tv or you could have 10 straight weeks

35:26.120 --> 35:32.160
of nothing but whippets and bubble tape don't say bubble tape flavored whippets don't save

35:32.160 --> 35:37.200
money uh because if you want things just get them what if you save your money to get hit

35:37.200 --> 35:41.360
by a truck i was gonna say this because of people saving that the economy is going downhill

35:41.360 --> 35:46.440
we gotta spend spend spend yeah great spend money like you were dying grace you're the

35:46.440 --> 35:54.760
the the kindling on which our feeble economy is building back into a blazing inferno of

35:54.760 --> 36:03.840
prosperity and and america is the zippo that's gonna set you on fire yeah so grace in closing

36:03.840 --> 36:10.600
set yourself on fire set yourself on fire and spend all your money or set your money

36:10.600 --> 36:17.200
on fire there it is there it is hey when did our podcast turn into mad money when people

36:17.200 --> 36:22.320
started asking us questions about money it's their problem ask here's the question we need

36:22.320 --> 36:27.840
to get should i ever ask you guys about money answer no there's your you know i have actually

36:27.840 --> 36:31.400
been so excellent with money since i moved to chicago do you guys want to know my secret

36:31.400 --> 36:37.380
tell me anytime i have the opportunity to spend money i say nah and i i do something

36:37.380 --> 36:42.480
else instead okay i like that yeah it's just many people like hey how do i drink less soda

36:42.480 --> 36:48.360
it's pretty cool actually um you don't drink soda anymore okay it is that easy it really

36:48.360 --> 36:52.800
is grace i mean if you're really serious about saving money take half the money you get and

36:52.800 --> 36:58.000
put it in a shoe box or a hundred percent of it just it's gone you never got that money

36:58.000 --> 37:03.300
yeah when when you see something you want think do i want this or do i need it and say

37:03.300 --> 37:08.520
well i'll leave it here now and if i still want it in like three days i'll come back

37:08.520 --> 37:12.960
and buy it and by that point you've forgotten about it yeah i you know another good one

37:12.960 --> 37:16.720
that works when you're at a store and you want something think to yourself it's probably

37:16.720 --> 37:20.040
cheaper on the internet i'll buy when i get home then you want to think about it again

37:20.040 --> 37:25.680
you won't or just shoplift just take it or take as you want how about this you get like

37:25.680 --> 37:31.440
we'll say 20 for for your allowance right you spend five of that on one whip it okay

37:31.440 --> 37:36.360
and you do it you do all of it really fast and then you will literally forget about the

37:36.360 --> 37:41.760
other 15 okay because that part of your brain will be there do you guys know how many problems

37:41.760 --> 37:46.000
can be served with the the liberal application of whip it the thing is it's important you

37:46.000 --> 37:50.200
gotta be thinking about the 15 as you do the whip it right it's like eternal sunshine of

37:50.200 --> 37:56.000
the spotless mind i got you got you the whippets hey do you guys know that i don't know what

37:56.000 --> 38:06.680
a whip it is moving on um my 21st birthday is a few months away i'd like to throw a fun

38:06.680 --> 38:11.440
party but i don't drink and i'd rather not have people drinking at my party what are

38:11.440 --> 38:17.800
some fun ideas for a sober 21st sincerely the life of the party does this person not

38:17.800 --> 38:22.400
understand that when you when you turn 21 that's the day that you're allowed to drink

38:22.400 --> 38:29.920
right here's a fun idea do some drinking just get some four locos and some trash monkeys

38:29.920 --> 38:36.160
and then just like just get it all out of the way in one night i i would love to like

38:36.160 --> 38:42.780
actually give a real answer i mean but besides like board games but even board games are

38:42.780 --> 38:47.840
more fun when you get a little tipsy and everyone gets stupid i mean like a good answer it's

38:47.840 --> 38:56.080
like saying uh i came downstairs uh on december the 25th and my christmas tree was ablaze

38:56.080 --> 39:00.640
and all my presents were ashes how could i have a fun christmas like you can't you can't

39:00.640 --> 39:08.320
because here's the thing and you are an adult now and it's time to have some adult fun when

39:08.320 --> 39:12.200
you turn like 40 yeah you can you can kick it and you can be like i don't want to drink

39:12.200 --> 39:18.220
anymore i'm old but right now part you if there are people at your party that wish they

39:18.220 --> 39:26.560
were drinking you have a bullshit party wait okay it's not a good party just you gotta

39:26.560 --> 39:32.440
not have a party you can't listen you can't have a party it's gonna be so depressing you

39:32.440 --> 39:37.120
can't do it i feel like i feel like we need to be more clearly spoken because it sounds

39:37.120 --> 39:44.800
like we're saying hey pussy like grab a beer pussy um which we're not but you can't i don't

39:44.800 --> 39:50.280
know it would be a bad idea for you to throw a 21st birthday party and then forbid people

39:50.280 --> 39:54.560
to drink that's exactly what you you don't have to drink like whatever if you if that's

39:54.560 --> 40:00.320
not your scene that's totally awesome um you know stand stick stick by your guns uh but

40:00.320 --> 40:04.240
i don't know i think it would be a little it's like having a pudding announcing you're

40:04.240 --> 40:10.240
having a pizza party and then not allowing anyone to eat pizza because not every party

40:10.240 --> 40:15.360
has to have booze at it but when you announce it's your 21st birthday there's a connotation

40:15.360 --> 40:22.160
to that where everyone goes turning 21 and then you're like no dbyob don't bring your

40:22.160 --> 40:28.240
own booze and that's sad that is depressing for everyone it's like it would be like having

40:28.240 --> 40:34.920
a quinceanera without a nice dress or any waltzes how many of us can we turn out it's

40:34.920 --> 40:41.460
like having um oh come on come apparently exactly that many apparently it's like having

40:41.460 --> 40:47.320
a dirt bike rally without any dirt bikes yeah sure yeah um it's like having a john cougar

40:47.320 --> 40:54.440
melon camp listening party and then not allowing anyone to wear any denim yeah it's like it's

40:54.440 --> 40:58.480
like making a bunch of jokes about whippets and not knowing what whippets are what a whip

40:58.480 --> 41:03.560
it is it's basically like that i think you just need to ask yourself why you don't want

41:03.560 --> 41:09.880
people drinking at the party because you you can you can do that you can have a party and

41:09.880 --> 41:15.220
police it and be like hey you you know you you're a little you're maybe a little tipsy

41:15.220 --> 41:20.520
so don't um you know don't have any more but i can see if it's your 21st you don't want

41:20.520 --> 41:24.680
a bunch of people doing something that makes you uncomfortable it's their pride it's their

41:24.680 --> 41:29.800
birthday i have an answer laser tag that's what i was just about to say go to a place

41:29.800 --> 41:32.840
that doesn't allow drinking and then my mind went to billy bobs and then my mind went to

41:32.840 --> 41:36.880
laser tag that's fucking incredible laser tag and then my mind went to tackling eight

41:36.880 --> 41:42.680
year old kids and saying who's who's the man now dog sure um get drunk on laser tag prowess

41:42.680 --> 41:48.400
yeah um or you could do like a fancy dinner at a fancy restaurant where people could drink

41:48.400 --> 41:53.120
if they wanted to but it's not at your house you're not throwing the party so it doesn't

41:53.120 --> 41:57.320
matter to you if people are drunk at a restaurant because nobody gets drunk at a restaurant

41:57.320 --> 42:02.720
these are all good suggestions also uh whippets whippets hey i've got a i've got a yahoo answers

42:02.720 --> 42:07.640
question oh okay i'm gonna make you go back to back but go ahead give it to me this one

42:07.640 --> 42:16.240

42:16.240 --> 42:23.400
animal lover uh-huh uh asks how big of a turn off is this parentheses for guys one

42:23.400 --> 42:29.380
of my nipples points inwards and won't come out aka inverted nipple is this a big turn

42:29.380 --> 42:37.360
off or not a big issue it's like the issue it's like the whole thing that's the thing

42:37.360 --> 42:44.240
it is a major issue that is the issue it is the the the pre-eminent issue of our time

42:44.240 --> 42:51.040
is that is that thing you said aka inverted nipple did you guys know that that is an alternate

42:51.040 --> 42:59.360
name that we can call this aka my time alone aka shy nipple shy nipple come on out oh hey

42:59.360 --> 43:07.560
um hey it's it's basically like my situation is like uh areola and then a basin like a

43:07.560 --> 43:14.200
basin in the middle i've got a concave nipple kind of deal you could eat cereal out of it

43:14.200 --> 43:17.680
is that normal i have one more crevice for the guys for my brother my brother made to

43:17.680 --> 43:25.040
fill with wisdom right now any nipple a nipple and there's nothing's coming there it's just

43:25.040 --> 43:32.440
an any nipple uh in how much of a turn off is it i think that it's i think that it's

43:32.440 --> 43:39.800
not a turn off so much as it is uh fraud it is a fraudulent uh relationship that you've

43:39.800 --> 43:44.400
entered into this gentleman he will have you tried in a federal court of law i want you

43:44.400 --> 43:49.080
guys to follow me on this okay the only way to combat a turn off is with a turn on and

43:49.080 --> 43:54.600
nothing is sexier than confidence my advice is to walk up to someone in a bar say hey

43:54.600 --> 43:58.520
my name is tanya i have one inverted nipple what's up what's up what's up you don't believe

43:58.520 --> 44:05.840
me click click booyah um play your cards right say say play your cards right maybe you'll

44:05.840 --> 44:13.240
find out if i'm lying and then that that evening you will confirm that you were not lying um

44:13.240 --> 44:18.280
yeah build a mystery around it that's that's the best yeah that's the best when you take

44:18.280 --> 44:23.920
off your shirt look down and scream where'd it go whoa get out of here he's nervous no

44:23.920 --> 44:27.760
one will ever love me and then you'll make that person be like well it's not so bad and

44:27.760 --> 44:31.800
then you're like well it's like now you're mine now you've already been committed to

44:31.800 --> 44:39.520
me um it's very bad it's a very bad thing it's a very bad thing um can i can i bust

44:39.520 --> 44:46.200
out some of the responses yeah please yeah um winky emoticon face okay uh which is not

44:46.200 --> 44:52.180
like spelled out it literally is one uh responded if he loves you he won't care if he doesn't

44:52.180 --> 44:58.240
love you he will it seems like kind of a binary like i don't think that this is a black or

44:58.240 --> 45:03.160
white issue i think that there can be degrees of grayness um in between it's got to be some

45:03.160 --> 45:07.880
weird beard fantasy right like it's got to be somebody who's like i love it i hate when

45:07.880 --> 45:12.800
girls have two that stick out i want to retch or when they have two that go in but when

45:12.800 --> 45:25.000
they're one in one like husky eyes yeah i want i have you considered wearing a patch

45:25.000 --> 45:32.640
over that one so when things get really intimate you're like you lift it up how about that

45:32.640 --> 45:40.920
how confused is that baby gonna be how confused is her baby gonna be so hungry so hungry but

45:40.920 --> 45:46.200
it's actually drawing milk out of me i it's it's like it's gonna be like the the uh el

45:46.200 --> 45:50.340
ranchero near my house like no matter how hungry you are it never seems like it's open

45:50.340 --> 45:59.000
you know keep coming back it's like again really what am i gonna do god uh it just most

45:59.000 --> 46:06.080
