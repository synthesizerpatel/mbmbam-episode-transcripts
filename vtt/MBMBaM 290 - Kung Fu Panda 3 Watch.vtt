00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.640
Hello everybody, and welcome to a very special edition of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.920
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.280
My name is Travis McElroy, and I'm your middle-est brother.

00:55.280 --> 01:01.680
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Boys, the fucking energy is electrifying in the studio

01:01.680 --> 01:11.520
today. That's because we're all on fire waiting for our chance to see Kung Fu Panda 3. America's

01:11.520 --> 01:18.480
favorite panda, Poe, is back. He's joined by Bryan Cranston as Lee. Dustin, a galaxy of stars.

01:19.520 --> 01:24.480
A whole nebula of beautiful stars shining up there on the silver screen. I gotta say,

01:24.480 --> 01:29.440
Kung Fu Panda 3 watch, it's been a while since we've had a watch before, yet, in a while. It's

01:29.440 --> 01:34.880
been a while, and now here we are again, and I have to say congratulations Kung Fu Panda 3.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.960
Didn't it come out like a month ago?

01:36.960 --> 01:40.560
No, it's on right now. We're all waiting for our chance to see it.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.160
I feel like I've been seeing previews for it for like two and a half years.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.120
Oh, that's because they've got to build the heat, they've got to build the buzz. Travis,

01:47.120 --> 01:49.120
in Hollywood, things are very competitive today.

01:49.120 --> 01:54.960
Griffin, what can you tell me about what you know about the plot of Kung Fu Panda 3?

01:54.960 --> 01:58.800
Well, following on the heels of Kung Fu Panda 2, the Dragon Shrine has been

01:58.800 --> 02:10.720
disgraced by the ape colony, and they will have a big fight, and Lucy Liu is a snake in it, and she-

02:10.720 --> 02:20.400
We seem to have lost Griffin, so fully pumped with the energy.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.720
Guys, I just got so excited, this electrifying energy. My throat literally closed up,

02:24.720 --> 02:27.280
and I couldn't breathe for a full 30 seconds.

02:27.280 --> 02:32.000
Do you have your EpiPen? Your Kung Fu Panda 3 branded EpiPen?

02:32.000 --> 02:36.560
Yeah, it shoots ramen broth into my veins.

02:36.560 --> 02:41.840
That's the thing, right? That he is both a Kung Fu master and a chubster.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.320
Is that the whole point of the three movies?

02:45.920 --> 02:52.000
I am so excited about Kung Fu Panda 3. I have yet to watch one and two, but I really feel like

02:52.000 --> 02:55.040
three is the one that's going to get me into this franchise.

02:55.040 --> 03:00.240
Are you worried that you'll be lost, Justin, like when I just saw The Matrix 3?

03:00.240 --> 03:01.920
A lot of people have been asking me,

03:01.920 --> 03:05.440
Justin, is Kung Fu Panda 3 a good entryway to the series?

03:05.440 --> 03:10.400
And as somebody who has not seen Kung Fu Panda 1 or 2, but is very excited about 3-

03:10.400 --> 03:13.520
Also has not seen 3 yet, because again, gang, it's been out for a couple days.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.280
Who's got the time?

03:15.280 --> 03:17.760
Just haven't made it, but the fire is electrifying.

03:17.760 --> 03:22.080
But my answer to that question is an unqualified yes.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.480
This is the place for new fans.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.480
I feel like a new generation is about to fall in love with Po, that beloved Kung Fu Panda.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.320
I always like to believe that Kung Fu Panda 3 was a bit of a reboot for the series,

03:34.320 --> 03:36.240
much grittier, much darker.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.520
It's the first one to have an R rating.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.640
The other ones really skirted it with a really hard PG-13.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.960
Yeah, the Fu stands for fucking.

03:46.960 --> 03:52.240
Yeah, and this is the first one that really leans into the original source material.

03:52.240 --> 03:55.360
And if I get full frontal panda nudity-

03:55.360 --> 03:57.760
Well, that's always been the whole franchise.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.960
Panda don't wear pants.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.760
Yeah, but this time you actually see his dong.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.760
You can see his dong through the whole thing, I've been led to believe.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.080
Haven't caught it yet, but do you think-

04:08.080 --> 04:10.240
Well, they're not going to show it in the previews, Justin.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.680
They're not going to give away the cow when you get the dong for free.

04:14.400 --> 04:22.080
Oh my God, guys, right now, stop what you're doing and find a poster of Kung Fu Panda 3.

04:22.080 --> 04:25.520
I'm going to drop a link for my brothers here in our Skype chat.

04:25.520 --> 04:30.160
If you could just look at that poster real quick and imagine his dong was there.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.680
It's the greatest poster that has ever been or ever will be.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.360
I understand this is a visual gag.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.080
It's too important.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.080
Okay, but no, yeah, it would be, yeah, it's literally him sitting.

04:40.080 --> 04:45.120
He's got his legs spread, balancing between two pillars as what looks like six children

04:45.120 --> 04:46.880
look up like perfectly where-

04:46.880 --> 04:47.360
You know what?

04:47.360 --> 04:49.520
You don't even need to have the dong on this poster.

04:49.520 --> 04:53.760
There's six children looking up into either his dong or his asshole.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.560
They can see through him.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.880
The children in this poster are looking at his gaping butthole.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.760
They're all baby burning underneath his gaping butthole.

05:05.760 --> 05:09.680
One dude is literally mouth agape at his gaping butthole.

05:09.680 --> 05:16.480
This spiritual sequel to The Human Centipede takes Poe in the role of the nutrient provider

05:16.480 --> 05:21.280
and the baby pandas as those who are gobbling up the sweet, sweet food.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.840
Are you reading this from the IMDB page, Justin?

05:23.840 --> 05:26.160
Yeah, this is from the credits narration.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.800
Oh, the scroll.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.760
This is the scroll that goes up before the film.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.360
I'm just so fucking excited to see this movie.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.360
I'm so fucking excited to see Kung Fu Panda 3 as soon as I get the opportunity, gang.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.880
I went to Hong Kong last year and I saw an actual panda and you know what I did?

05:40.880 --> 05:44.160
I yelled fuck you at it because it's not my Poe.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.680
I said not my Poe.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.400
I'm most excited about Jackie Chan in the film.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.680
Absolutely.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.600
And is it live action Jackie Chan like Michael Jordan in Space Jam?

05:53.600 --> 05:56.000
It's like Cool World, Jackie Chan edition.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
But if Jackie Chan dies in Kung Fu Panda 3, does he die in the real world?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.480
Any world with Jackie Chan in it is a cool world.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.120
It's like who framed Jackie Chan except nobody can because how are you going to stop him?

06:07.120 --> 06:10.880
He just chopped that frame to bits, chopped it to matchsticks.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.000
Hey Travis.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.800
Yes?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.240
Rank them.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.760
Good question, Justin.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.520
I'm going to say one, two, and three.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.920
You're counting.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.040
Rank them.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.880
Okay, two, three, and one.

06:24.880 --> 06:29.040
And to provide some justification for your rankings.

06:29.040 --> 06:34.320
Okay, well I'm going to say two because it's my favorite and then three because it's my

06:34.320 --> 06:37.360
second favorite and then one because it's my third favorite.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.240
Okay, perfect.

06:38.240 --> 06:38.880
That's excellent.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.240
Griffin, rank them.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.480
Oh shit.

06:42.480 --> 06:48.800
Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Kate Hudson, James Hong.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.600
Oh.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.520
Okay, fuck, marry, kill, Jack Black, Poe, Poe with Jack Black's head.

06:54.400 --> 06:54.720
God.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.400
Oh, well, I would probably fucking kill all of them.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.520
We are just so excited about Kung Fu Panda 3.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.320
Just so excited.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.080
The electricity in the studio is electrifying.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.240
We're on fire here for this film.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.800
Bryan Cranston was a breaking bad and he could have done anything.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.600
You know what he did?

07:16.480 --> 07:17.280
Several things.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.280
And then after those, do you know what he did after those?

07:19.280 --> 07:20.320
A couple more.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.600
And then you know what he did?

07:21.600 --> 07:23.120
Kung Fu Panda 3.

07:23.120 --> 07:23.680
Okay.

07:23.680 --> 07:28.640
Actually, it says on his IMDB page, he ran out of things to do and started back at the

07:28.640 --> 07:33.680
beginning again with Kung Fu Panda 3 because Bryan Cranston is a flat circle.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.160
Bryan Cranston wept because there are no more countries to conquer.

07:36.160 --> 07:36.880
He said, fuck it.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.720
It's time for me to get up in the panda mix.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.400
And so he did it.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.160
Oh, God, I'm fucking raging hard on for this flick, guys.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.520
Just like Poe.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.880
Hey, let's go not to the money zone because we haven't earned that.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.160
But let's do some advice.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.360
Okay, sure.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.160
Sounds good.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.880
I guess I'll close this picture of Kung Fu Panda now.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.400
Here's my first piece of advice.

07:57.120 --> 08:02.080
Get a ticket today to go see Kung Fu Panda.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.360
See it in 3D.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.320
See it in 1D.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.480
You'll still enjoy it.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.520
It's just a line.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.000
It's just a line of changing color.

08:11.120 --> 08:16.560
And sound, that glorious sound, which is like a fifth dimension because you'll be teleported.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.080
Jesus, Justin, you're right.

08:18.080 --> 08:18.480
What?

08:18.480 --> 08:20.320
Sound is the fifth dimension.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.480
Hey, why are we just now figuring this out?

08:23.600 --> 08:24.240
You're welcome.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.920
Gravity waves, shmavity waves.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.920
I say go see Kung Fu Panda 3.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.280
It's got gravity in it.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.280
It's got gravity and it'll take you to the sound dimension.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.800
And it's got gravity toss.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.680
It's got gravity toss.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.120
It's so important.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.000
So important.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.280
So important.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.240
I wish this movie had a smell so I could smell it.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.480
Find the right theater.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.040
Or the wrong one.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.000
Hey.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.280
Read a question.

08:49.280 --> 08:49.840
Here's some.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.360
I will read a question.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.720
I'm just really excited right now about Kung Fu Panda 3.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.240
You need a distraction.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.120
Is that what it is?

08:58.080 --> 09:00.800
Is it the 10 solid minutes of talking about Kung Fu Panda 3?

09:00.800 --> 09:06.720
I'm not sure we've got the 10 solid minutes of expressing our excitement about Kung Fu Panda 3.

09:06.720 --> 09:11.600
I'm using new recording equipment and I can't tell exactly where it started.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.720
No, we're at 10.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.480
Are we at fully 10?

09:14.480 --> 09:16.160
Like I don't want to tell people.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.680
Okay, let me say this.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.720
Poe would never promise to use Kung Fu on someone and then not do it in front of an audience.

09:22.720 --> 09:29.920
And vice versa, I don't want to promise 10 minutes of unadulterated Kung Fu Panda 3

09:29.920 --> 09:33.120
excitement and then not deliver it in the final recording.

09:34.000 --> 09:34.960
That's a great point.

09:34.960 --> 09:39.920
So if there's anything, Griffin, any stitch of audio you think you might edit out from

09:39.920 --> 09:43.360
the previous 10 minutes, please, please let me know.

09:43.360 --> 09:47.520
The only part that I'll edit out is- I'll bloatgate more about the adventures of Poe and Ko.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.040
Poe and Ko sequel.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.800
The only part I'll probably edit out is where I talked about how this,

09:52.800 --> 09:55.600
my excitement for this film had given me a raging hog.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.160
Raging hog is my favorite of the Kung Fu Panda crew too.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.600
He's like a mean old, mean old Mongolian pig man.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.000
It's slippery snake, raging hog.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.320
Hot cock.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.320
Throbbing cock.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.320
Throbbing cock.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.600
Whistling clam.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.400
Rabid weasel.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.320
Listen, hey listen-

10:18.320 --> 10:19.760
Penis, penis Tom.

10:21.920 --> 10:27.200
This is unexpected and perhaps a little unprecedented in cinema,

10:27.200 --> 10:34.000
but I am so excited about Kung Fu Panda 3 that I want a sequel to Kung Fu Panda 3.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.120
I don't want Kung Fu Panda 4.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.280
You want Kung Fu Panda 3 2.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.440
I want Kung Fu Panda 3 2.

10:39.440 --> 10:39.840
Yes.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.800
Is that possible?

10:40.800 --> 10:41.600
Cool.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.480
Anything's possible in this crazy, weird, holly weird.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.720
Okay, so I answer some questions now.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.120
I'm just really, it's really hard for me to-

10:49.920 --> 10:51.920
Well, let's give it a try and we'll see like how it goes.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.440
If I offer a coveted ticket to an event for free to someone,

10:57.440 --> 10:59.520
how long should I give them to respond?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.160
I had someone him and Hoffer weeks before-

11:03.360 --> 11:05.760
Before taking the ticket to Kung Fu Panda 3.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.480
That's what the ticket, why did it have to be about a ticket?

11:08.480 --> 11:11.600
Because now I can think about is, let me just,

11:11.600 --> 11:13.840
I'll just insert it so my mind doesn't wander, okay?

11:14.560 --> 11:14.800
Okay.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.240
I'm watching a trailer in another window.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.600
Let me just pause it, hold on.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.240
Wait, I've got three of them going simultaneously.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.000
So let me put a different part.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.360
So they're looping endlessly.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.240
Let me just pause.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.360
Okay, okay, okay.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.960
All right, I got them all close.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.280
Well, minimized so I can still hear them.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.360
If I offer a coveted ticket to Kung Fu Panda 3

11:39.360 --> 11:42.720
for free to someone, how long should I give them to respond?

11:42.720 --> 11:44.640
I had someone him and Hoffer weeks before

11:44.640 --> 11:47.200
giving me a response about going to Kung Fu Panda 3

11:47.200 --> 11:49.680
with a free hotel room provided.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.240
Oh man.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.360
Now to be fair.

11:51.360 --> 11:51.680
To be fair here.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.200
That movie is so good, it really took it out of me.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.560
I need to go to sleep right now.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.080
Well, we provide hotel rooms.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.800
To be fair, that is, it was actually regarding Comic-Con

12:00.800 --> 12:03.920
and a free hotel room, hundreds and hundreds of dollars

12:03.920 --> 12:08.640
as opposed to the 12.95 to see Kung Fu Panda 3.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.680
In 2D?

12:09.680 --> 12:11.200
I mean, you're gonna be paying, okay.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.480
You pay extra for 2D?

12:13.360 --> 12:14.320
Yeah, I would.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.520
How many D's you want?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.640
You're gonna get them all in Kung Fu Panda 3D.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.560
Another friend waited a week to tell me

12:22.560 --> 12:24.880
they couldn't make it to a music festival.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.880
That's from Irritated Altruist.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.720
So this is crazy.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.720
First of all, Comic-Con with a free hotel room

12:32.720 --> 12:35.360
is, that's what, like a G?

12:35.360 --> 12:37.840
That's like one stack easily?

12:37.840 --> 12:38.080
Yeah.

12:39.040 --> 12:39.760
That's like great.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.800
That's an enormous thing to give to somebody for free.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.280
If they're not like shoot from the hip and be like,

12:45.280 --> 12:47.360
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.120
A thousand dollars, thank you, yes.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.800
At the very least, they could take it and resell it

12:50.800 --> 12:51.840
and get that stack.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.840
I feel like you're so within your rights

12:53.840 --> 12:56.720
after like three days to just say like,

12:56.720 --> 12:58.240
hey, I need to hear back on this.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.320
If you can't do it, I'll ask someone else.

13:00.320 --> 13:05.600
I think you can grindstone a little bit.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.440
It's worth, if there's a value on it,

13:10.080 --> 13:11.840
I think it's worth giving them a timetable

13:11.840 --> 13:12.880
when you make the offer.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.960
If there's any hemming and hawing, just say,

13:14.960 --> 13:17.200
hey, I need you to let me know in like three days

13:17.200 --> 13:19.360
because if not, I'm gonna get somebody else to go with me.

13:20.160 --> 13:24.560
And because I think that offering a timeline later,

13:25.200 --> 13:28.960
it feels like, I think that you're,

13:28.960 --> 13:32.000
I think it makes you seem desperate for like,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.840
considering the fact that you're giving someone a gift,

13:33.840 --> 13:34.960
you shouldn't have to do that.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.720
You shouldn't have to establish a timeline later.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.520
They should just be accepting it, going for it.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.880
And there's a really, you get to use the sentence,

13:42.880 --> 13:44.880
I really need to figure this out,

13:44.880 --> 13:47.120
which is a really official sounding sentence,

13:47.120 --> 13:51.280
but doesn't actually imply any kind of consequences.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.240
It's not like, I got Jim breathing down my neck, man.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.480
I really gotta figure this out.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.720
So if after like three days, you can just be like,

13:58.720 --> 14:00.240
yeah, I really need to get this figured out.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.120
Are you able to go?

14:01.120 --> 14:04.000
Cause if not, I need to like figure something else out.

14:05.040 --> 14:05.440
You know what?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.600
I'm about to tell a pretty hard line on this.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.360
You give them 30 fucking seconds.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.800
This is a $1,000 trip I'm offering to take you,

14:12.800 --> 14:14.320
my best friend, Kyle, to.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.200
You have 30 fucking seconds to make up your mind

14:17.200 --> 14:19.600
because this is a wonderful opportunity.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.720
And if you don't jump at it now.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.060
Okay.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.240
When someone asks me if I wanna do something,

14:26.240 --> 14:29.440
when I say, let me look at my schedule and figure it out,

14:30.080 --> 14:31.040
I'm lying.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.920
Almost all the time, I'm lying.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.600
I think everybody is, right?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.120
Like if you're into something,

14:37.120 --> 14:39.600
and you're like into it right away, you just say yes.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.960
And the other things are like,

14:40.960 --> 14:42.160
they'll figure it out around that.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.240
If I say, let me think about it.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.040
Let me look at my schedule.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.880
What I'm saying is, let me talk to my wife

14:46.880 --> 14:49.600
and see if she can help me cook up a pretty good lie

14:49.600 --> 14:51.360
for why I can't go to your thing.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.320
Like she won't let me lie,

14:52.320 --> 14:54.720
but she'll help me come up with a reason why I can't.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.320
Because I need that sometimes to help sort through these things.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.760
Or my wife will convince me,

14:59.760 --> 15:01.840
hey, this is something you should probably do.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.880
It'd be good for you to do it.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.800
But either way, it means let me talk to my wife about it.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.600
I don't need to talk to my wife.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.120
And that's not necessarily a reflection on you,

15:09.120 --> 15:11.200
the question asker, whether they wanna go with you.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.240
Sometimes just committing to something in the future

15:14.240 --> 15:16.640
like gives me such panic attacks of like,

15:16.640 --> 15:17.920
yeah, but what if something happens?

15:17.920 --> 15:20.160
But what if like in a month, somebody tells me

15:20.160 --> 15:21.440
I need to do blah, blah, blah.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.080
You know what I mean?

15:22.080 --> 15:23.440
Like, it's not always like,

15:23.440 --> 15:25.280
oh, I don't wanna go with Joan.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.800
Sometimes it's like, okay,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.680
but like, do I wanna commit to something three?

15:29.680 --> 15:32.560
Like I sat on like buying concert tickets

15:32.560 --> 15:35.920
for like 20 minutes just going, but who knows the future?

15:35.920 --> 15:36.720
I did the opposite.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.120
I accidentally bought 17 tickets to Carly Rae Jepsen

15:39.120 --> 15:39.920
this coming weekend.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.120
You just kept clicking?

15:41.120 --> 15:42.640
I just kept doing it over and over again.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.720
Cause I was like, what if I lose the first 16?

15:44.720 --> 15:45.840
What would you rather have?

15:45.840 --> 15:49.360
Would you rather have someone him and haw for like two weeks

15:49.360 --> 15:51.280
or have someone say yes immediately

15:51.280 --> 15:54.400
and then like a week before the event be like,

15:54.400 --> 15:56.960
hey, I can't go and now you're fucked.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.320
Oh, that's a good point, Travis,

15:58.320 --> 16:01.040
because the side effect of them answering too quickly

16:01.040 --> 16:03.840
might be that they have to bail and that's the worst, right?

16:03.840 --> 16:06.400
Yeah, so I feel like you have to find a balance

16:06.400 --> 16:09.440
between those two of like, here's your timeline.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.400
So it gives me enough time to ask other people

16:12.400 --> 16:14.160
because especially if it's like, listen,

16:14.160 --> 16:16.000
it's four months till Comic-Con or whatever,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.640
I need an answer and then versus like, okay,

16:18.640 --> 16:21.200
well I have three days till Comic-Con to find someone else

16:21.200 --> 16:22.320
to go with now.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.040
I tell you if you, oh, sorry, go ahead, Griffin.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.960
I'll tell you if you really wanna get good

16:26.960 --> 16:28.320
at making these kinds of distinctions,

16:28.320 --> 16:30.240
plan a wedding, cause that is literally

16:30.240 --> 16:32.880
just like 150 times.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.800
Just like, hey, you wanna come get like fucked up

16:34.800 --> 16:37.200
and eat some sick food and dance to some dope tunes

16:37.200 --> 16:38.640
with me and my newly betrothed.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.440
And then you'll get like, let me sit on that

16:41.440 --> 16:42.080
for a month and a half.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.040
Oh, the happiest day of your life?

16:43.040 --> 16:44.240
Let me just sit on that.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.680
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll totally be in there.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.760
Yeah, totally, five days before the event.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.200
Can't make it, guess you have to throw that food

16:49.200 --> 16:50.160
in the yard.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.560
Guess you have to pour that wine down the toilet.

16:58.080 --> 17:02.160
I think the better approach is to not ask people

17:02.160 --> 17:04.880
way out in advance because for me,

17:04.880 --> 17:07.600
the likelihood that I'll accept an offer like this

17:07.600 --> 17:10.800
actually grows as it gets close to the event

17:10.800 --> 17:13.200
because then I think it starts to take on the fun

17:13.200 --> 17:14.080
of spontaneity.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.080
One time I was going to a murder mystery

17:16.080 --> 17:17.840
with a bunch of friends and I had two friends

17:18.480 --> 17:21.760
who had an illness in the family

17:21.760 --> 17:24.800
and they had to bail like 24 hours before.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.760
And my friend Michael Beck lives in Indiana

17:27.760 --> 17:30.240
and I called that thug the morning of and said,

17:30.240 --> 17:33.360
hey, get in your car and start driving to Ohio.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.520
You're going to a murder mystery this weekend.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.040
And that dude did it.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.160
He found an Ascot and that weekend he ended up running

17:40.160 --> 17:42.000
from a guy in a werewolf costume.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.840
So these things do pan out sometimes.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.280
Wait, what?

17:45.280 --> 17:48.000
Yeah, it was a whole crazy story that we'll have to tell.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.760
It's the most scared I've ever been in my entire life.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.720
Okay, no, but I don't want us to get too deep into it,

17:52.720 --> 17:53.920
but I do want to say like,

17:53.920 --> 17:55.280
that's not a good murder mystery.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.880
The werewolf done did it.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.800
The werewolf was a rogue member.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.560
He was not associated with the company

18:02.560 --> 18:03.520
putting on the murder mystery.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.000
He was, if you will, a lone wolf.

18:06.000 --> 18:06.960
Yeah, okay.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.800
And he scared me in a gypsy camp

18:08.800 --> 18:10.480
and I ran silently through the woods.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.200
I ran into a tree, but he could not find me.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.400
I was very proud of myself.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.000
You cover your tracks.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.040
You put them in a tiger pit.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.120
The one last thing I want to say about this.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.720
I also pretended that a gun I had

18:20.720 --> 18:22.560
had magical wolf killing powers

18:22.560 --> 18:24.000
because once a werewolf shows up,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.120
you're playing Calvin Ball.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.720
The rules of the murder mystery done fell away.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.400
The best laid plans of mice and men

18:30.400 --> 18:32.560
just go straight down the turret

18:32.560 --> 18:34.080
when a werewolf rolls up.

18:34.080 --> 18:34.880
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

18:35.600 --> 18:36.880
Can I take a quick sidebar?

18:37.520 --> 18:38.080
Yeah.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.760
It's not about Kung Fu Panda 3.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.280
That's not true.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.480
Though it is about cinema.

18:42.480 --> 18:47.760
I would say now top three discussions

18:47.760 --> 18:49.920
that we've had on My Brother, My Brother, Me

18:49.920 --> 18:53.120
and we never circle back around to things on this show.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.920
It is actually a part of the DNA of this program

18:55.920 --> 18:57.120
that we never look back.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.680
No, it is a linear march through time.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.360
We had our necks removed.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.160
But I have to say the conversation

19:04.160 --> 19:06.160
that we've gotten perhaps the most,

19:06.160 --> 19:07.840
at least top three feedback

19:07.840 --> 19:09.760
in the entire history of this show

19:09.760 --> 19:13.520
has been our conversation about Travis's experience

19:13.520 --> 19:16.880
watching Night at the Museum crew with three mics.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.840
Folks, we had like Freddie Wong,

19:19.840 --> 19:21.280
who is an actual person

19:21.280 --> 19:23.040
who is making video professionally

19:23.760 --> 19:28.240
create a fabrication, a lie to support Travis's story.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.320
There are people creating fake web pages.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.280
There are people who reshot Malcolm in the middle scenes

19:33.280 --> 19:34.960
to try to justify it.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.120
Frankie Munoz came out of retirement

19:37.120 --> 19:38.800
to shoot Malcolm in the middle scenes.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.000
I don't know who the fuck,

19:40.000 --> 19:45.440
like who's leading this worldwide Illuminati conspiracy

19:45.440 --> 19:47.120
just to troll me and Justin.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.360
And the crazy thing is everybody's been saying like,

19:49.360 --> 19:50.640
Travis, you've been vindicated.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.800
I also thought I was making it up.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.120
Yeah.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.040
I also believed it was a fever dream

19:55.040 --> 19:57.360
brought on by Ben Stiller's amazing performance

19:57.360 --> 19:58.400
in Night at the Museum.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.920
In case you didn't listen last week,

19:59.920 --> 20:01.360
Travis on Night at the Museum 3

20:01.360 --> 20:04.400
and could swear that the film was framed in such a way

20:04.400 --> 20:06.080
that he was seeing like boom mics

20:06.080 --> 20:07.280
and stuff through the entire page.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.800
Well, let's not rewrite history.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.080
It's Night at the Museum 1.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.120
I have never nor will ever see Night at the Museum 3.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.160
They know what they did.

20:15.920 --> 20:16.960
Let me just say this

20:16.960 --> 20:18.480
because the thing we've heard is

20:18.480 --> 20:19.120
there's a thing called

20:19.680 --> 20:21.520
according to this fucking worldwide conspiracy thing

20:21.520 --> 20:22.800
called open matting

20:22.800 --> 20:24.560
where the fucking projectionists

20:24.560 --> 20:28.240
are apparently supposed to put up the letter box around it.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.520
And if they don't put it up right,

20:29.520 --> 20:30.880
you see the wires and shit.

20:30.880 --> 20:35.440
That's the joke we said on the thing.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.840
That's the most ridiculous thing ever.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.400
People would film this shit and be like,

20:40.400 --> 20:42.240
uh, cameraman, are you sure?

20:42.240 --> 20:43.520
Because there's like-

20:43.520 --> 20:46.640
Yeah, some 18 year old drunk kid will take care of it.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.840
Yeah, don't worry guys.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.320
We got it 90 yards down the field.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.520
Drunk Brian,

20:51.520 --> 20:54.240
drunk 16 year old Brian's gonna get it the rest of the way.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.280
He's gonna run it into the insert.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.040
While he's playing with his nunchucks.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.680
We put $6 trillion into the making of Avatar.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.200
I think Brian's got it.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.680
Do you think that if you saw Avatar like this,

21:05.680 --> 21:06.880
that the bottom of the screen,

21:06.880 --> 21:09.680
you'd just see like James Cameron's legs

21:09.680 --> 21:11.520
as he's moving puppets around and shit?

21:11.520 --> 21:12.880
You would see the Navis like,

21:13.840 --> 21:15.120
like bottom of their torsos

21:15.120 --> 21:16.480
and it's just not painted blue.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.440
It's just like a regular fleshy torso

21:19.440 --> 21:22.800
and like a regular non-blue genitals.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.600
I'm not even wearing my Navi pants down here, guys.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.320
Let's loosen up.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.080
Casual Friday, Brian's got it.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.040
You see the hand up Yoda's ass,

21:31.040 --> 21:32.160
like making it talk.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.480
Like this is the worst Star Wars I've ever seen.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.920
And you see the puppeteer's other hand

21:35.920 --> 21:38.480
like making a fake jerk off motion on the Yoda puppet.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.360
Like, I get it.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.560
Don't worry, Brian will get this.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.160
What the fuck?

21:44.080 --> 21:45.200
Holly weird.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.520
Do you think if we open Kung Fu Panda 3,

21:47.520 --> 21:49.760
we'll see like Jack Black underneath Poe?

21:49.760 --> 21:52.800
Like doing the lines down here.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.560
Just writing tenacious D lyrics.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.720
Yeah, oh fuck.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.400
So Travis was lying.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.280
Please, please, please, please, please.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.880
God, you're embarrassing yourselves.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.520
And stop sending us these Malcolm in the Middle screencaps.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.680
I mean, I love good Malcolm in the Middle jokes

22:07.680 --> 22:09.360
as much as anybody, but fuck.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.440
I don't think it's really glossy JPEGs

22:11.440 --> 22:12.640
with Malcolm in the Middle.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.400
You can just zip those right over to my inbox.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.840
Yeah, just zip drive those up,

22:17.840 --> 22:19.200
put them on a jazzy drive,

22:19.200 --> 22:21.360
and just flip those over to us, please.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.520
I will say there was one of these

22:23.520 --> 22:25.760
that showed Dewey standing

22:25.760 --> 22:31.600
and it's the most mental thing I've ever seen.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.240
This weird Dewey homunculus

22:34.800 --> 22:37.200
standing next to Frankie Muniz.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.160
Holy shit.

22:38.160 --> 22:38.960
Yeah, it's as though someone was-

22:38.960 --> 22:41.280
What was the kid who played Dewey doing

22:41.280 --> 22:44.000
that you couldn't be in that shot?

22:44.000 --> 22:44.800
Yeah.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.680
Is it on me?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.760
No, then I'll be in my fucking trailer.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.800
Get Dennis out here.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.280
And listen, if you guys get the matting wrong,

22:51.280 --> 22:52.640
I'll fucking kill you.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.440
I have it in my contract.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.320
I'm Dewey, damn it.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.160
It's as though someone is filming Malcolm in the Middle

22:58.160 --> 22:58.960
and behind them,

22:58.960 --> 23:00.800
someone is sweeping Malcolm in the Middle.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.040
Like they're creating their own Malcolm in the Middle fan film

23:03.760 --> 23:04.880
directly in the same shot.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.840
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

23:07.840 --> 23:08.400
Thank you, Morgan.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Wade, who asks,

23:12.800 --> 23:16.480
can anyone recommend some good weightlifting music?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.200
I'm making a playlist of workout songs

23:19.200 --> 23:20.720
for my high school weight room

23:20.720 --> 23:22.880
and I need some great heavy metal songs

23:22.880 --> 23:25.600
with great pump-up riffs and heavy drums.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.120
Nothing from the 80s, please.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.880
Late 90s to modern day, please.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.560
YouTube links would be appreciated.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.640
No rap, pop, hip hop, or techno.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.800
Nothing from the 80s?

23:34.800 --> 23:35.760
Go fuck yourself.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.960
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of restrictions on here

23:38.960 --> 23:40.880
that this person can go fuck themselves about.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.680
Does weird outfit into this?

23:44.400 --> 23:45.360
Now, explain.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.200
I think they would make really good pump-up jams.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.240
Yes, okay, I respectfully disagree.

23:52.960 --> 23:53.440
Fair enough.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.280
What about, when were the Scorpions?

23:57.280 --> 23:59.440
They're actually, they're modern day.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.720
They're describing like once,

24:00.720 --> 24:03.040
it's like they want you to back into one song.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.360
Like they have one song in mind.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.120
Across my weightlifting bridge,

24:07.120 --> 24:08.960
you must answer this riddle.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.360
How about this?

24:11.360 --> 24:13.600
If you're trying to get sick gains,

24:14.480 --> 24:16.880
then might I recommend Chris Gaines?

24:16.880 --> 24:19.440
The heaviest of metals.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.160
Fuck heavy metal.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.680
No, let's put that restriction in the garbage

24:21.680 --> 24:24.000
because if that's the case, then we're not gonna get anywhere.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.080
We know how to get this person's sick gains

24:26.080 --> 24:26.880
better than anybody.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.600
And that is to listen to the sweat pumping,

24:29.600 --> 24:33.920
muscle grinding, rock riffs of Chris Gaines.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.920
That was the whole point of Chris Gaines, right?

24:35.920 --> 24:37.760
Because Garth Brooks said,

24:37.760 --> 24:42.320
okay, well, I can't do the heavy rock that I want to.

24:42.320 --> 24:46.480
So he Stefan Erkeld himself and made Chris Gaines.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.280
So Chris Gaines could do the rock anthems

24:49.280 --> 24:51.200
that he had been dreaming of.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.040
The greatest regret of my life

24:53.600 --> 24:56.080
is that this program was not in production

24:56.800 --> 24:59.600
while the Chris Gaines saga was unfolding.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.240
Oh, Jesus.

25:00.240 --> 25:05.520
My dream actually, I want our max fun bonus episode

25:05.520 --> 25:08.320
to be a alternate reality episode

25:08.320 --> 25:13.520
released the week that Chris Gaines is like on SNL

25:13.520 --> 25:14.640
and behind the music.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.880
And can you imagine while it's happening?

25:16.880 --> 25:20.320
Because I am so sad that I was not talking.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.040
Do you know that this fool said Chris Gaines

25:23.040 --> 25:24.480
was from Australia?

25:25.280 --> 25:30.080
Can you imagine being in his management entourage group

25:30.080 --> 25:32.880
when fucking G Brooks is like, guys, I've got it.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.160
Guys, guys, got this sick idea.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.000
He said he's from Australia.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.240
First off, you're not only locking yourself

25:42.240 --> 25:45.600
into like making this alter ego.

25:45.600 --> 25:49.040
If you do an interview, you have to,

25:49.040 --> 25:50.320
like Garth Brooks is like,

25:50.320 --> 25:52.800
oh fuck, they have, they talk different, don't they?

25:52.800 --> 25:53.200
Shit.

25:53.200 --> 25:53.840
Okay, hold on.

25:53.840 --> 25:54.480
Give me a second.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.440
Let me try to cook.

25:55.440 --> 25:56.800
Shrimp on the barbie.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.440
Like Garth, no.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.680
Hello there, it's me, Chris Gaines.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.320
No way, Garth Brooks.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.840
Can I pivot a little bit?

26:06.640 --> 26:08.080
Why do people work out?

26:08.080 --> 26:10.400
Why do people get those sick gains

26:10.400 --> 26:13.040
to get those fucking glistening fish lifters?

26:14.080 --> 26:16.560
I'm only calling them Chris Gaines from now on, by the way.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.320
All I want in the gym is Chris Gaines.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.760
Is it to impress people that they would like

26:21.760 --> 26:23.760
to engage in sexual Congress with?

26:24.320 --> 26:25.360
That's probably part of it, right?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.760
But there's a lot of different ways that you can do that.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.120
I think for the most part, it is an intimidation, right?

26:31.120 --> 26:32.880
You make yourself bigger to scare.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.040
I mean, this is basic wilderness shit.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.080
You make yourself big to scare off a predator.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.360
So you wanna make yourself big

26:39.360 --> 26:41.600
so you can intimidate people and get fucking power plays

26:41.600 --> 26:42.240
all over the place.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.400
If that's the case, I think you carry that whole aesthetic

26:44.400 --> 26:46.640
over to the gym while you're trying to get Chris Gaines.

26:48.400 --> 26:53.200
To that extent, why not just put on a song on a big speaker

26:53.200 --> 26:55.120
that's just gonna sort of freak everybody out

26:56.880 --> 26:57.760
while you're getting your gains

26:57.760 --> 26:59.440
and sort of attract attention to yourself

26:59.440 --> 27:01.360
and you are enjoying it and getting Chris Gaines

27:02.160 --> 27:05.040
to a song that maybe people don't understand

27:05.040 --> 27:06.000
and maybe they're scared of that.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.720
Maybe just say anything, the whole thing,

27:08.720 --> 27:10.960
and you're just lifting the speaker over your head

27:10.960 --> 27:12.880
and that's how you're doing your curls.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.400
You're getting your Chris Gaines

27:14.400 --> 27:17.920
by blasting Chris Gaines over your head and just screaming.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.600
Chris Gaines is too obvious a choice.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.000
I'm saying we keep it weird.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.880
I'm saying what about you're doing some deadlifts

27:24.880 --> 27:28.000
to the theme song to the cartoon show Bobby's World.

27:29.360 --> 27:29.680
Okay.

27:30.880 --> 27:31.920
You're like crunching it

27:31.920 --> 27:34.080
and you've got a lot of crunching some bars

27:34.080 --> 27:40.960
and it's just like, oh, fuck yeah.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.760
Oh yeah.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.480
Some big gains today, boys.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.880
Sounds like a guy masturbating to Bobby's World theme.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.640
Yeah, it can be both.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.080
Yeah, with 61.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.320
It is kind of a, I mean, I will say this.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.600
It's kind of a horrifying theme song.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.640
Like it's kind of really scary.

28:02.640 --> 28:07.600
Out of context, it's very like Tim Burton's clown nightmare.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.080
Yeah, if you slowed that down like a half beat,

28:10.800 --> 28:13.440
I think you would have something very, very terrifying.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.880
Put it in like a minor key

28:14.880 --> 28:18.080
and then you just hit the fucking everyday fitness

28:18.080 --> 28:20.880
and get some fucking fish lifters.

28:20.880 --> 28:24.160
What if you just played books on tape over the sound system?

28:25.120 --> 28:25.600
What book?

28:25.600 --> 28:26.000
What book?

28:26.000 --> 28:26.400
What book?

28:26.400 --> 28:26.720
What book?

28:26.720 --> 28:27.120
What book?

28:27.120 --> 28:27.680
This is good.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.760
This is Travis to really stick.

28:29.760 --> 28:30.400
Okay, yeah.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.520
Eat, pray, lift.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.960
Like that, pray, lift.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.800
Dear God, please let me get gains today.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.600
Oh, thank you.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.040
Will you please, I've told you this before,

28:41.040 --> 28:42.160
don't pray with your mouth full.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.920
It's rude to me, it's rude to God.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.280
You want to go to the Money Zone?

28:47.280 --> 28:54.960
Hell yeah.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.720
If you want to see a great website, maybe the best one ever,

29:00.720 --> 29:02.880
go to mackleroyshows.com

29:02.880 --> 29:08.480
and you're going to see a modern work of like art,

29:08.480 --> 29:10.480
I guess art, maybe, is it?

29:10.480 --> 29:11.040
Yeah, art.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.600
It's art and science.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.200
And commercialism and capitalism and like big business

29:17.200 --> 29:19.520
and fuck boys, we sold out.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.400
We did it.

29:20.400 --> 29:24.080
Travis, how hard was it to make a site with Squarespace?

29:24.080 --> 29:26.080
Honestly, Justin, and I'm not just saying this

29:26.080 --> 29:27.840
because they are our sponsors this week,

29:27.840 --> 29:30.960
it was the easiest fucking thing in the world.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.360
And not just easy to do, but easy to make look really nice

29:35.360 --> 29:37.280
because they had amazing templates.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.040
And it was a lot of it was just like,

29:39.040 --> 29:40.560
okay, I'm going to type in this thing.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.880
And then they took that information

29:42.880 --> 29:46.320
and turned it into a really polished sharp looking website.

29:46.320 --> 29:50.000
We've got a website that I can't recommend it enough

29:50.000 --> 29:52.240
how much I loved working with Squarespace

29:52.240 --> 29:54.480
and how many compliments I've gotten on it.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.640

29:59.840 --> 30:02.320

30:02.320 --> 30:05.520
I want to talk about me undies wearing them right now.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.040
I've got those lounge pants.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.720
It is like a blanket.

30:09.280 --> 30:12.160
Did you get those Keith Haring Valentine's Day designs?

30:12.160 --> 30:14.400
Of course, I got those Keith Haring Valentine's Day designs.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.840
I wore them and I felt, can I just say something?

30:17.840 --> 30:19.760
And this may turn some people off.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.120
I felt sexy all day.

30:21.120 --> 30:21.440
I felt-

30:21.440 --> 30:23.680
I'm more worried it may turn some people on.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.640
I'm not worried about that at all.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.480
I felt grown sexy.

30:27.120 --> 30:27.520
I felt-

30:27.520 --> 30:28.320
You're a grown boy.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.800
I felt terrific like a grown sexy lad.

30:32.240 --> 30:35.760
Like Poe in Kung Fu Panda 2 when he finally-

30:35.760 --> 30:37.680
Except with your dong covered.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.640
Yes, please.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.760
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.920
the world's most comfortable underwear

30:48.320 --> 30:50.480
Every single week we hear from listeners

30:50.480 --> 30:52.640
who finally took the plunge and got the me undies

30:52.640 --> 30:54.320
and they're never going back.

30:54.320 --> 30:58.160
When I wear non me undies, I feel like a criminal.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.040
That should go to jail.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.480
I feel like I should go to jail.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.320
I feel like I've been like a bad lad.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.320

31:28.080 --> 31:30.160
We also have another message here.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.520

31:33.520 --> 31:36.800
Oh, you can go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.400
That's a great question, thank you.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.040
Can I tell you about Photo Jojo?

31:41.040 --> 31:43.120
Oh yes, I love Photo Jojo.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.360
The bad guy from fucking Powerpuff Girls?

31:45.360 --> 31:46.560
No, that's his brother.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.000
Okay.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.200
Photo Jojo has photography gear for everyone

31:51.200 --> 31:54.400
because everyone has a camera in their pocket these days.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.640
From nifty little lenses that attach to your phone

31:56.640 --> 31:58.880
to the latest instant camera from Polaroid.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.160
Yep, they still make them.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.640
To cute camera straps and backup phone batteries.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.680
Go check out all this great stuff at photojojo.com.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.600
That's photo, like the word photo.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.240

32:10.240 --> 32:14.640
Use the coupon code MIDDLIST to save five buckarinos.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.880
Plus it took a lot to convince my coworkers

32:16.880 --> 32:19.040
that this ad would be money well spent.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.360
Show them I'm right, min-bam-binos.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.360
The cutest thing they got is they have sort of a battery

32:25.360 --> 32:27.120
that plugs into your phone to charge it up.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.400
It's called apple juice,

32:28.400 --> 32:30.160
and it looks like a little container of apple juice.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.120
It's fucking adorable.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.200
I think we, Teresa got that, right?

32:33.200 --> 32:34.640
Photo Jojo sent us some cool stuff.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.520
Teresa got the apple juice.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.600
There's really like super cute stuff,

32:39.600 --> 32:41.680
really neat accessories.

32:41.680 --> 32:46.320
And like if you want to take better photos with your phone,

32:46.320 --> 32:49.280
which is still a standard, you can do that by the way.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.080
That's wild.

32:50.080 --> 32:50.880
And not just phone stuff.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.160
They have camera equipment too.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.200
Photojojo.com, coupon code MIDDLIST.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.960
Can I tell a quick little vignette?

32:56.960 --> 32:57.680
Yeah.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.000
I was at a wedding this past weekend in New Orleans,

33:00.000 --> 33:01.040
and it was cute.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.480
They had the guest book,

33:02.480 --> 33:03.600
and then right next to the guest book,

33:03.600 --> 33:05.680
they had like one of these instant Polaroid cameras

33:05.680 --> 33:07.600
that take like the little pictures, little guys.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.560
And then they had another book

33:10.560 --> 33:12.000
that you would just like slide those into

33:12.000 --> 33:13.520
and like write your names right next to your picture,

33:13.520 --> 33:16.240
your little Polaroid selfie.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.440
But we were like an hour into the wedding

33:17.440 --> 33:18.960
and we realized nobody had used it yet.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.400
And so me and Rachel were like,

33:20.400 --> 33:21.600
well, the people who play in this wedding

33:21.600 --> 33:22.800
probably like wanted people to do this.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.400
So like, let's just like get it started.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.600
So people will feel more comfortable.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.240
And then we did it.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.920
We took a picture of ourselves and put it in the book

33:28.480 --> 33:30.640
and signed it.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.040
And then like a half hour went by

33:33.040 --> 33:35.120
and I started to get legitimately worried

33:35.120 --> 33:37.040
that we would be the only people to do it.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.680
And then our like wedding present to them would be like,

33:40.240 --> 33:43.360
here's a book with a picture of us only in it.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.400
Happy wedding.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.360
It's the Griffin and Rachel book for us at your wedding.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.560
It's us though.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.920
It is us though.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.280
It's your wedding, your special day,

33:51.280 --> 33:52.640
but it's our fucking book.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.640
Do you think about just filling it

33:54.640 --> 33:56.320
with pictures of you and Rachel?

33:56.320 --> 33:57.120
Didn't think about that,

33:57.120 --> 33:59.120
which would be another fun gift for anybody.

33:59.680 --> 34:00.960
Anybody would love that.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.560
I got a message for Thomas

34:02.560 --> 34:04.960
from Sierra Madden Puppy and Piggy.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.080
It says, happy birthday.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.120
I wrote you a haiku.

34:07.680 --> 34:08.160
Here we go.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.800
My dungeon master,

34:10.800 --> 34:14.480
you are the Tom to my Gronk, Mandy Patinkin.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.800
I feel like at the end they just needed,

34:16.800 --> 34:18.720
they were maybe short on this.

34:18.720 --> 34:21.440
Justin, everyone knows that in a haiku

34:21.440 --> 34:24.960
you have to either have a reference to like spring,

34:24.960 --> 34:27.840
the nature, weather, or Mandy Patinkin.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.960
You're talking about Kigo.

34:30.160 --> 34:30.640
Of course.

34:30.640 --> 34:33.200
Yeah, I guess I am Griffin, but aren't we all?

34:33.200 --> 34:34.880
The traditional Kigo are,

34:35.440 --> 34:37.600
you know, they're relating to the current season.

34:37.600 --> 34:42.320
So something like leaves, flowers, renewal, sunshine,

34:42.320 --> 34:45.360
Mandy Patinkin, because fucking Homeland

34:45.360 --> 34:46.240
is about to start up again.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.040
People still on that tip, huh?

34:49.840 --> 34:52.640
He's just, get one of his albums,

34:53.600 --> 34:55.520
singing Broadway show tune.

34:55.520 --> 34:58.480
Kidults, don't mind if I do buy a copy

34:58.480 --> 35:00.320
of Kidults right now on Amazon,

35:00.320 --> 35:01.600
cause I can't find mine.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.600
Probably cause I gave it to a dear friend.

35:03.600 --> 35:07.520
And another exciting announcement.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.800
I committed kidultry, unfortunately.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.160
Everybody who has a question read

35:14.160 --> 35:16.000
or a message on today's show

35:16.000 --> 35:20.800
will receive a free ticket to go see Kung Fu Panda 3.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.800
Just email me, Justin at teengoogle.com

35:25.520 --> 35:29.040
and I'll make sure you get, I'm not fucking with you.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.520
I will make sure you get enough Fandango cash

35:31.520 --> 35:33.280
to go see Kung Fu Panda 3.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.360
If you use it for anything else, I'll fucking know.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.920
Wait, that's only if you have a question

35:37.920 --> 35:40.160
right on the show, not if you just email Justin.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.000
Yeah, no, if you have a question right on the show

35:42.960 --> 35:45.280
or one of those messages from you,

35:45.840 --> 35:46.800
then please let me know

35:46.800 --> 35:49.120
and I'll make sure you get your ticket to Kung Fu Panda 3

35:49.120 --> 35:51.760
and you gotta go fucking see it if I'm gonna do the thing.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.040
I wanna see a ticket stub.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.120
You guys said we wanna see pictures of you

35:55.120 --> 35:56.000
at the movie theater.

35:56.000 --> 35:56.960
I will end you.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.000
Holding the ticket stub, torn ticket stub.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.760
If you go fucking see Deadpool,

36:01.760 --> 36:03.840
I'll spend all my days trying to burn.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.200
I will salt the earth.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.440
I will call your place of employment

36:07.440 --> 36:09.440
and say horrible lies.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.560
Don't think that you're gonna like outthink Justin

36:12.560 --> 36:14.800
and say like, oh, I can think of a funnier thing

36:14.800 --> 36:15.920
to do with this fan date.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.240
No, there is nothing funnier you can do

36:18.240 --> 36:21.360
than go see Kung Fu Panda 3

36:21.360 --> 36:23.440
and then let Justin know what you thought of it.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.360
This is an important question, Justin.

36:25.360 --> 36:28.080
Will you be paying enough for them to see it in 3D IMAX

36:28.080 --> 36:30.640
or just for your basic 2D version?

36:30.640 --> 36:32.960
I'm not made of money, it's a basic 2D version.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.200
This film is certified fresh, 81%.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.200
Please stop fucking around

36:37.200 --> 36:39.680
and go see Kung Fu Panda 3 in theaters now.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.160
We are not in any way paid to do this.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.840
I cannot make this clear enough.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.440
This is not native marketing

36:45.440 --> 36:47.040
or whatever the fuck it's called.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.320
We're just fans.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.400
We're just fans of Kung Fu Panda 3

36:50.400 --> 36:52.640
despite never having seen one of the films.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.000
I've seen the first.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.320
I have seen, I think, an episode of the TV show.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.480
Is that Jack Black or is that a Jack Black-alike?

37:00.480 --> 37:04.160
I think it's probably just like his brother, Jack Brown.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.520
You idiot.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.520
Let's be honest, we live in a world with too much media.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.520
You need a podcast on the front lines,

37:13.520 --> 37:15.040
figuring out what's great.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.000
We're here for you.

37:16.000 --> 37:16.960
We're Pop Rocket.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.160
I am Guy Branham.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.360
I'm a comedian.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.160
I'm Wynton Mitchell.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.080
I call myself a digital strategist.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.960
I'm Oliver Wang, academic and disc junkie.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.200
Margaret Wappler, je suis es journaliste.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.560
And we watch, listen to, and read everything

37:30.560 --> 37:31.920
so that you don't have to.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.280
And then we tell you about all the things

37:33.280 --> 37:34.640
that you'll love to love.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.600
Find us in iTunes or wherever you download podcasts.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.160
Pop Rocket, every Wednesday from MaximumFun.org.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.280
I'm a fashion student.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.520
I love clothes and putting together outfits.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.400
But like you often say, a ship in harbor is safe.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.320
And sometimes I mess the heck up.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.880
And if this happens in BD, I'll go change.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.880
But my friends and fam now make fun of me

37:54.880 --> 37:57.920
for times when they've seen me in two or three outfits

37:57.920 --> 37:58.480
in a day.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.840
I paint, sew, and go out pretty often.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.560
So it's not just from sartorial floop ups.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.840
My question is, how are people not doing this?

38:07.840 --> 38:09.680
Are some people just okay with being uncomfortable

38:09.680 --> 38:11.120
socially or physically with their outfits?

38:11.120 --> 38:12.000
Do I have a problem?

38:12.560 --> 38:17.360
Not currently in the nude in the North XX.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.680
So this person will often change clothes

38:19.680 --> 38:21.360
multiple times throughout the day.

38:21.360 --> 38:22.640
Oh, okay.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.440
Got it.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.080
No.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.440
I mean, no.

38:27.440 --> 38:31.280
I have like a uniform basically.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.080
You realize we're three Dugs.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.320
Like basically three Dugs.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.080
I got some t-shirts.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.600
I got some jeans.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.880
I got some cowboy boots.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.760
And that's what I call my Travis.

38:45.360 --> 38:48.080
That's all the accessories that come with the Travis doll.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.840
I have never worn khaki pants where I did not first

38:51.840 --> 38:54.560
have a thought, where the fuck are my khaki pants?

38:54.560 --> 38:56.000
Like that's every time.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.080
They were not at the ready.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.880
Yeah, I do not have them like ready to go.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.320
At this wedding I went to last weekend,

39:02.320 --> 39:03.680
I brought my wedding wear.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.280
And then I found out there was a cocktail party

39:05.280 --> 39:06.560
the night before and was like, yeah,

39:06.560 --> 39:07.680
you should wear something nice for that.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.160
I was like, well, that's going to be a problem

39:10.800 --> 39:14.160
because I have wedding Griffin and that's just it.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.400
I don't have a cocktail party Griffin style.

39:16.400 --> 39:20.000
I, Teresa was telling me her father has every day

39:20.000 --> 39:24.240
that she's known him, when he gets home from work,

39:24.240 --> 39:26.320
he immediately like walks in the door.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.920
And the first thing he does is changes every stitch

39:29.920 --> 39:32.560
of clothing to like his home wear.

39:33.440 --> 39:36.560
And I love this, like socks, like everything.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.320
He's doing it in the Japanese style.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.200
Yeah, he's like sloughing off work

39:41.200 --> 39:45.760
in a very physical real way that I think is a pretty cool move.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.320
I don't get that move because I'm at home

39:48.320 --> 39:50.000
in pajama pants all day.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.160
So I can't be like, oh, another tough one.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.120
Oh, the old rat race trying to put on some comfier clothes.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.040
I wish I had the dedication to do that.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.000
I wish that I did have, we've talked about this,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.680
I mean, literally last week.

40:01.680 --> 40:04.640
I wish I had the dedication to wear something

40:04.640 --> 40:07.200
like more stern and restrictive

40:07.200 --> 40:09.440
to just have that freedom at the end of the day.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.040
You put on a tie every day.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.800
It's important to note, I want to make it clear

40:12.800 --> 40:14.240
that when I talk about my father-in-law,

40:14.240 --> 40:16.080
he's not like changing into pajamas.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.440
He gets home, he changes into other regular clothes

40:19.440 --> 40:22.080
that you could then go out back into the world in

40:22.080 --> 40:24.640
and then changes again for bed.

40:25.520 --> 40:30.560
So he's like got work outfit, home outfit, sleep outfit.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.880
I think that's pretty cool.

40:33.760 --> 40:39.280
And his casual yukata, a kimono worn in the casual times.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.720
I don't want to part the kimono,

40:40.720 --> 40:42.800
but that's what Travis' dad-in-law wears.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.880
Griffin, do you have another yahoo for us?

40:44.880 --> 40:46.320
Yes, how about this one?

40:46.320 --> 40:48.800
It was sent in by Level 9000 Yajuru Drew Davenport.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.840
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.680
The Poe of Humans.

40:52.880 --> 40:57.440
Big, imposing, kind, loving, excellent at kung fu.

40:57.440 --> 40:57.920
Dick out.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.320
Dick always out.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.440
24 seven.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.200
24 seven dick out bonanza.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.880
I'm not going to tell him how to do his thing though

41:04.880 --> 41:06.640
because obviously he knows what's up.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.360
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

41:09.360 --> 41:12.160
It's by yahooanswersuser.

41:12.160 --> 41:18.560
Steffi who asks, please, I need to know how to start

41:18.560 --> 41:22.080
with Popeye the Sailor Man eulogy for my speech class.

41:22.880 --> 41:23.360
What?

41:23.360 --> 41:26.080
Please, I need the speech for this Monday.

41:28.160 --> 41:28.960
What?

41:28.960 --> 41:32.160
Please, Travis, I need to know how to start

41:32.160 --> 41:35.040
with Popeye the Sailor Man eulogy for my speech class.

41:35.600 --> 41:39.040
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.200
There's a very important distinction here.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.240
Please.

41:42.240 --> 41:46.640
Are you giving a eulogy for Popeye the Sailor Man

41:46.640 --> 41:49.200
or as Popeye the Sailor Man?

41:49.200 --> 41:53.120
As, guys, as hysterical as I think we could make the ladder

41:54.320 --> 41:56.560
with all of us doing our Popeye impressions

41:56.560 --> 41:57.680
and what have you.

41:57.680 --> 42:02.720
I think we should focus on the former, which is my dude.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.520
What has this motherfucker here?

42:10.080 --> 42:10.960
That's what we're doing.

42:10.960 --> 42:11.920
He got me clean.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.200
He got me clean right now.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.480
Popeye the Sponsor Man.

42:14.480 --> 42:15.840
I love him like a brother.

42:15.840 --> 42:16.880
I never told him.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.320
He was my real brother.

42:18.320 --> 42:18.560
My name is-

42:18.560 --> 42:20.880
He was my real, I'm Steven the Sailor Man.

42:20.880 --> 42:23.520
I'm Church's the Sailor Man.

42:24.160 --> 42:24.960
The Sailor Man.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.280
Oh, God.

42:27.280 --> 42:30.080
If our father, Pappy the Sailor Man were here today,

42:30.960 --> 42:34.480
but of course they haven't spoken in 36 years.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.760
And now it's too late.

42:35.760 --> 42:36.560
Now it's too late?

42:36.560 --> 42:37.040
Damn it, Popeye.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.240
The living years.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.200
Damn it, Popeye.

42:39.200 --> 42:40.880
Damn you.

42:40.880 --> 42:42.320
This is how you do me.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.240
You leave me like this, you son of a bitch.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.000
I mean, we know his cause of death, right?

42:48.000 --> 42:51.120
Bluto, who is like, Bluto's fucking huge,

42:51.120 --> 42:52.480
just killed him finally.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.400
Do you think Bluto's there?

42:54.400 --> 42:56.160
Do you think he had the fucking sheer balls?

42:56.160 --> 42:57.760
I'm sorry, Popeye.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.760
I didn't mean to.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.480
Didn't mean to.

43:00.480 --> 43:02.720
We were just doing our usual punch routine.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.320
I punched you and you went through the roof,

43:04.320 --> 43:06.400
only this time you hemorrhaged.

43:06.400 --> 43:07.840
I hit you through a horse,

43:07.840 --> 43:10.480
and then you got one of them big swelling lumps

43:10.480 --> 43:13.200
on top of your head and the horseshoe swung around it,

43:13.200 --> 43:15.520
but then you didn't get up again.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.760
I punched you till your brain stopped working,

43:17.760 --> 43:21.040
then I tried to pour the spin notch down your mouth

43:21.040 --> 43:22.880
and you choked on them.

43:22.880 --> 43:26.080
And the spittoon done fell on your head.

43:26.080 --> 43:27.200
No.

43:27.200 --> 43:31.440
Can you imagine anything funnier than seeing Bluto

43:31.440 --> 43:36.000
just like forcing the jaw of Popeye's car?

43:36.000 --> 43:39.520
Popeye's corpse up and down trying to help him mask it.

43:39.520 --> 43:43.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.840
Here I come, Bluto.

43:45.840 --> 43:49.200
I'm gonna get you real good.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.000
Everybody comes-

43:50.000 --> 43:52.240
He's strong to the finish.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.520
Everybody.

43:53.520 --> 43:58.640
Olive Oya got to help me scoop the spin notch down his throat.

43:58.640 --> 43:59.760
I love him.

43:59.760 --> 44:02.400
Everybody comes around and Bluto like lifts him up

44:02.400 --> 44:04.720
and puts his arm around him like,

44:04.720 --> 44:07.040
I know he's fine, listen.

44:07.040 --> 44:11.120
I'm Popeye the Sailor Man.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.440
Why are you moving his mouth, Bluto?

44:13.440 --> 44:16.160
That's terrible.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.680
Don't touch him.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.720
And Wimpy like shows up like five minutes late.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.240
He's like, hey, good news, everybody.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.440
I found a hamburger.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.440
And they're like, Wimpy not now.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.280
He realizes what happened and he's like,

44:27.280 --> 44:30.640
I wasn't here, I can't go back.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.840
I can't take this heat.

44:31.840 --> 44:38.800
I got people waiting for me on the inside.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.640
What if that wasn't his cause of death?

44:40.640 --> 44:41.920
What if he just ate some spinach?

44:41.920 --> 44:43.040
He was like, time to get real,

44:43.040 --> 44:45.280
wait, my arm won't stop growing, oh shit.

44:45.280 --> 44:48.240
And he's just like, Akira just like explodes.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.720
His body gets too diesel.

44:52.720 --> 44:55.040
And then soon he just like starts rapidly expanding

44:55.040 --> 44:57.600
until he completely consumes Neo Tokyo.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.120
Let me paint you a picture.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.440
He goes in for his yearly checkup physical

45:01.440 --> 45:05.920
and the doctor's like, Popeye, I can't say it enough.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.360
I won't tell you again.

45:07.360 --> 45:09.760
You have to knock it off with the spinach.

45:09.760 --> 45:13.040
Your body is 92% spinach at this point.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.880
I don't know how much more of this you can take.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.960
If you change again, you might never come back.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.200
And Popeye's like, okay.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.040
But then one day he sees an injustice

45:23.040 --> 45:25.280
and he goes for that spinach and he's like, I can't.

45:25.280 --> 45:28.720
I can't, but the city cries out, Popeye, Popeye.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.680
And he does it knowing it's the end.

45:33.360 --> 45:35.520
And he goes out Akira just like he always dreamed.

45:35.520 --> 45:37.600
Okay, that wasn't so much funny

45:37.600 --> 45:39.760
as much as it was like pretty good fan fiction.

45:40.960 --> 45:42.080
I'm trying to pitch that.

45:42.080 --> 45:42.960
If anyone's listening,

45:42.960 --> 45:46.240
if you've got, it will be a multi-million dollar production.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.880
I'm thinking it'll be like a Pixar level.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.840
Oh, see, I was thinking like a Christopher Nolan Batman flick

45:51.840 --> 45:54.560
where Bluto, is it Bluto?

45:55.360 --> 45:55.920
Yeah, yeah.

45:55.920 --> 45:56.800
It would be like Bane.

45:56.800 --> 45:57.920
Pluto is Mickey's dog.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.720
Well, this will be the first dark Pixar movie.

46:00.720 --> 46:04.960
I'm thinking like a Pixar cartoon with like a hard PG-13.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.560
So if anyone's looking to invest,

46:07.600 --> 46:10.000
I've got a Kickstarter going for a million dollars.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.960
You can get a producer's credit for $2 million.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.960
You can come to the animation studio.

46:14.960 --> 46:16.560
It does start at a million dollars.

46:16.560 --> 46:17.120
Okay.

46:17.120 --> 46:20.080
For $13.95, you can go see Kung Fu Panda 3

46:20.080 --> 46:22.240
and just like save your fucking time

46:22.240 --> 46:25.040
because you'll never want to see another movie after that.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.640
Hey folks, that's going to do it for us.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.400
I want to say two things.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.560

46:50.960 --> 46:53.120
and Grammy performance last night.

46:53.120 --> 46:53.920
So fucking good.

46:53.920 --> 46:57.680
And Lin, thank you for probably accidentally kicking off

46:57.680 --> 47:00.320
like a full-blown Illuminati deep dive

47:00.880 --> 47:04.880
into your whole life history

47:04.880 --> 47:09.200
by the people who are desperately looking into the Freemasons

47:09.200 --> 47:11.040
and like the triangles and all that shit

47:11.040 --> 47:14.000
with your secret my brother, my brother, and me gesture.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.480
And I don't want to, prying eyes.

47:16.480 --> 47:17.680
If you know it, you know it.

47:17.680 --> 47:18.480
If you know it, you know it.

47:18.480 --> 47:19.360

47:20.400 --> 47:21.840
Join our fucking Facebook group.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.080

47:48.480 --> 47:51.600
I also want to say I'm launching a new podcast pretty soon

47:51.600 --> 47:54.880
because I get bored and generate new podcasts constantly.

47:54.880 --> 47:55.200
What?

47:55.200 --> 47:55.760
It's too many.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.160
It's a lot of podcasts, Travis.

47:58.160 --> 48:00.560
It's all I've got and I love it very, very much.

48:00.560 --> 48:03.360
But this one's called Interrobang with Travis and Tybee.

48:03.360 --> 48:04.960
You can find it on macroshows.com.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.640
We got a promo up now so you can hear it

48:06.640 --> 48:08.400
and subscribe on iTunes and all that.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.680
I'm actually really happy about this

48:09.680 --> 48:13.280
because it makes it even on the website.

48:13.280 --> 48:15.760
Now there are three columns of six.

48:15.760 --> 48:16.960
That makes me really happy.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.520
We're also really excited because this is the week

48:19.520 --> 48:22.240
that we're moving Trends Like These over onto MaxFun.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.240
So if you haven't checked out Trends Like These yet,

48:24.240 --> 48:25.200
go check that out.

48:25.760 --> 48:28.000
Go check out Still Buffering on MaxFun.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.200
Yep, they just did.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.280
Oh my God, the new episode of Still Buffering,

48:31.280 --> 48:34.480
which is about my wife Sydney and her sister Riley who's 15

48:35.040 --> 48:39.760
and them like explaining the teen life then and today.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.640
There is a segment on today's show,

48:42.640 --> 48:46.880
an extended segment of the new episode about Instagram

48:46.880 --> 48:49.040
and her explaining Instagram and Snapchat

48:49.040 --> 48:49.520
that was like.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.720
Oh, I know everything there is to know

48:50.720 --> 48:51.920
about those two platforms.

48:51.920 --> 48:53.920
Well, you don't trust me.

48:53.920 --> 48:54.960
I thought I did.

48:54.960 --> 48:58.480
It is the most captivating listen of 2016

48:58.480 --> 48:59.280
as far as I'm concerned.

48:59.280 --> 49:00.400
I was losing my mind.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.280
It's fascinating.

49:02.080 --> 49:04.640
Go check out Rose Buddies that Griffin does with Rachel.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.760
I have never, well, I tried to watch an episode

49:07.760 --> 49:09.760
of The Bachelor and I made it about 20 minutes in,

49:09.760 --> 49:11.840
but I have never been a fan of The Bachelor,

49:11.840 --> 49:14.000
but I fucking love Rose Buddies.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.360
It's become my new favorite show.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.160
Thank you, Travie.

49:16.160 --> 49:18.800
And then also go check out Schmanner's

49:18.800 --> 49:20.000
that my wife and I do.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
We put out a Valentine's Day special

49:22.000 --> 49:23.760
that was all about like the history

49:23.760 --> 49:25.760
and customs of Valentine's Day,

49:25.760 --> 49:28.880
as well as another normal episode last week,

49:28.880 --> 49:31.520
all about being a house guest and hosting a house guest.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.560
So go check that out

49:33.520 --> 49:35.840
and then check out all the other amazing Maximum Fun shows.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.120
There's a ton on there.

49:37.120 --> 49:38.800
Thanks to John Roderick and the Lawn Winners

49:38.800 --> 49:39.920
for using their theme song,

49:39.920 --> 49:40.880
It's a Departure, off the album,

49:40.880 --> 49:41.760
Putting the Days to Bed.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.760
Yeah, it's a great album.

49:43.760 --> 49:48.320
You can get it on vinyl, get it on wax on Amazon.

49:50.000 --> 49:50.960
Sorry, Juice.

49:50.960 --> 49:51.280
Nothing.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.160
Did you have something else?

49:52.880 --> 49:54.320
No, just I love you.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.120
I love you.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.960
I love you guys, too.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.240
Do you guys realize that by the time

49:58.240 --> 49:59.360
we record this next episode,

49:59.360 --> 50:01.360
I will have seen Carly Rae Jepsen in concert

50:01.360 --> 50:03.040
and I will literally just be,

50:04.000 --> 50:05.600
I mean, I'm already blissed to light

50:05.600 --> 50:08.960
of a floating like piece of light consciousness

50:08.960 --> 50:11.200
just exploring the spiral galaxy

50:11.200 --> 50:14.240
and I'm just gonna stop by the ACL taping

50:14.240 --> 50:15.200
of Carly Rae Jepsen

50:15.200 --> 50:17.200
and I don't know what the next fucking level

50:17.200 --> 50:19.200
of consciousness is above that,

50:19.760 --> 50:20.320
but I'm really-

50:20.320 --> 50:22.800
You just wake up and you are Carly Rae Jepsen

50:22.800 --> 50:24.560
like being John Malkovich.

50:24.560 --> 50:25.520
Ooh, that'll be fun.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.440
Yeah, it is.

50:27.440 --> 50:28.560
It's pretty great.

50:29.840 --> 50:30.400
If I could say-

50:30.400 --> 50:32.160
I've been Carly Rae Jepsen for years.

50:32.160 --> 50:36.400
If I could say one sort of personal,

50:37.120 --> 50:38.880
more serious thing before we close

50:38.880 --> 50:41.200
and this isn't the sort of thing

50:41.200 --> 50:42.160
we normally talk about on the show

50:42.160 --> 50:44.320
and I didn't run this past you guys before,

50:44.320 --> 50:50.320
but sometimes we all have like struggles

50:50.640 --> 50:52.960
and I know that our listeners have expressed to us

50:52.960 --> 50:55.280
how our show has helped them

50:55.280 --> 50:58.480
and I know that like for future generations,

50:59.280 --> 51:01.920
everybody's gonna have things that they're going through

51:02.880 --> 51:04.160
and I don't mean to be oblique,

51:04.160 --> 51:05.280
but I don't know your struggles.

51:05.280 --> 51:11.680
But I wanna make sure that when my daughter comes of age

51:12.720 --> 51:15.760
and her daughter after her comes of age

51:15.760 --> 51:19.040
and she has struggles or things she's struggling with in life,

51:20.400 --> 51:24.880
I wanna make sure there's a new Kung Fu Panda movie

51:24.880 --> 51:27.120
for her every time.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.280
Every generation needs its Kung Fu Panda movies

51:31.280 --> 51:33.440
and I feel like if we could all just go see

51:33.440 --> 51:35.280
Kung Fu Panda 3 this weekend,

51:35.280 --> 51:38.400
we can really guarantee that that continues to be.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.880
Do you wanna be the last link in the chain?

51:40.880 --> 51:42.720
I don't wanna be the last link in the Kung Fu Panda chain.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.000
And hey, why wait till the weekend?

51:44.000 --> 51:44.800
It's what I'm saying.

51:44.800 --> 51:45.680
It's Tuesday now.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.560
The ideal time to see any movie,

51:48.560 --> 51:50.800
everyone knows this, is 11 30 in the morning

51:50.800 --> 51:51.840
on like a Thursday.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.560
I know we don't usually get serious on the show,

51:56.560 --> 51:57.760
but I have something I'd like to talk about

51:57.760 --> 51:58.800
really quick here at the end

51:58.800 --> 52:02.800
and that is, there's a lot of,

52:04.160 --> 52:05.680
the reason I love this podcast in the community

52:05.680 --> 52:07.040
that we've sort of surrounded ourselves with

52:07.040 --> 52:11.040
is that I feel like there's a lot of sort of bad stuff

52:11.040 --> 52:12.400
happening in the world today.

52:12.400 --> 52:16.480
And it's so easy to like consume the media

52:16.480 --> 52:21.200
that you consume and just sort of be distracted

52:21.200 --> 52:22.880
by the noise of it all, right?

52:22.880 --> 52:25.360
And just sort of turn a blind eye to all the injustices

52:25.360 --> 52:27.120
that are happening in the world today.

52:27.120 --> 52:29.200
And that's fine, like, you know,

52:29.200 --> 52:32.000
I'm glad that we can provide sort of a safe place

52:32.000 --> 52:35.440
for people, but I think that we need to sort of confront

52:35.440 --> 52:37.360
some of these things head on.

52:37.360 --> 52:41.760
And I would recommend starting with joining my boycott

52:41.760 --> 52:45.760
of the Village Voice for their fucking slanderous review

52:45.760 --> 52:50.760
of Kung Fu Panda 3, written by Alan Sherstal.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.800
Get that negativity out, Alan.

52:52.800 --> 52:54.960
Yeah, Alan, like we get it.

52:54.960 --> 52:59.120
Like, you're too cool for Kung Fu 3.

52:59.120 --> 53:01.200
We get it, you're too cool for Poe.

53:01.200 --> 53:03.680
It's okay to unironically love stuff, Alan.

53:03.680 --> 53:07.120
Yeah, and so anyway, never buy another issue,

53:07.120 --> 53:08.800
never again, write him a letter that just says

53:08.800 --> 53:10.960
never again, Alan, you know what you did.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.280
And then a paw print, a panda paw print,

53:13.280 --> 53:15.440
and then say this one's for my pandas.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.280
Now, we don't usually get-

53:17.280 --> 53:18.240
No, we don't.

53:18.240 --> 53:19.760
We don't usually get serious on the show,

53:19.760 --> 53:21.280
but can I just say real quick,

53:21.280 --> 53:24.960
I have killed before, and the only thing

53:24.960 --> 53:27.520
that stops me from killing again is knowing

53:27.520 --> 53:30.000
that there's a new Kung Fu Panda movie out.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.520
And if society were to, for some reason,

53:33.520 --> 53:37.760
take that away from me, I don't know what I would do.

53:37.760 --> 53:42.760
Travis's soul is the respite of a dark passenger.

53:43.360 --> 53:47.360
I've got what scientists call a dark passenger.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.680
See, when I was little, I was a little bit

53:49.680 --> 53:51.520
of a dark passenger.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.920
See, when I was little, I died for five seconds

53:53.920 --> 53:55.520
and something came back with me.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.320
Yes.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.640
And the only thing that allows me

53:58.640 --> 54:02.240
to control the hunger within is knowing

54:02.240 --> 54:04.400
that there's a new Kung Fu Panda movie

54:04.400 --> 54:06.320
every like two to three years.

54:07.200 --> 54:10.080
And I worry that if that ever stops-

54:10.080 --> 54:12.720
Yeah, you're gonna throw some-

54:12.720 --> 54:14.960
Let me just say, the voice I hear in my head

54:14.960 --> 54:17.040
is no language spoken by man.

54:17.040 --> 54:17.840
No.

54:17.840 --> 54:19.200
As far as I know, ever.

54:19.200 --> 54:22.000
But it's Jack Black doing the voice, which is weird.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.560
Yeah, and just the only phrase I can understand

54:26.560 --> 54:29.600
is just two words and it's old gods.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.640
Yeah.

54:30.640 --> 54:35.520
And if Kung Fu Panda were to ever not be there

54:35.520 --> 54:38.080
as a barrier against the darkness,

54:38.080 --> 54:39.680
I worry not only for myself,

54:39.680 --> 54:44.120
but for everyone in this plane of existence.

54:44.120 --> 54:47.280
If you've just finished watching this clip

54:47.280 --> 54:50.000
of the YouTube video after Travis commits

54:50.000 --> 54:51.520
some terrible atrocity,

54:51.520 --> 54:53.760
you should know that we thought he was kidding.

54:56.640 --> 54:58.000
Well, thanks for listening.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.920
You want a final Yahoo?

55:03.920 --> 55:04.800
Yes.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.560
This final Yahoo was sent in by level9000.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.600
YajurJudu Devonport.

55:07.600 --> 55:07.920
Thank you, Drew.

55:07.920 --> 55:10.240
It's by YajurAnswers user, Abby, who asks,

55:11.920 --> 55:15.040
can anybody find out if Billy Zane is available

55:15.040 --> 55:18.560
to sell pasta at my new store, Cal Pasta?

55:20.960 --> 55:22.480
My name is Justin McElroy.

55:22.480 --> 55:23.200
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:23.200 --> 55:24.160
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.280
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

55:25.280 --> 55:25.920
Kiss your dad.

55:25.920 --> 55:27.040
Square on the lips.

55:27.040 --> 55:46.000
Skadoosh.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.840
Maximumfun.org.

55:47.840 --> 55:48.960
Comedy and culture.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.000
Artist owned.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.200
Listener supported.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.600
The three of you enter a cave of a big red dragon

55:53.600 --> 55:57.280
and is standing over a hoard of precious golden rubies.

55:57.280 --> 55:59.600
And he says, what do you do, adventurers?

55:59.600 --> 56:00.800
I'm a dragon man.

56:00.800 --> 56:01.680
I cast fire on him.

56:01.680 --> 56:02.560
It's very good.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.480
I address the red dragon and say,

56:04.480 --> 56:06.560
us, we're the hosts of The Adventure Zone,

56:06.560 --> 56:09.760
a podcast about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

56:09.760 --> 56:10.800
Very good synergy.

56:10.800 --> 56:11.680
Commit to the bit.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.280
I roll to charm new listeners.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.080
It is very effective, against all odds.

56:18.080 --> 56:19.120
Everybody, we're the McElroys.

56:19.120 --> 56:20.080
We host The Adventure Zone,

56:20.080 --> 56:22.160
a podcast where we play Dungeons and Dragons together.

56:22.160 --> 56:23.440
It's a comedy podcast.

56:23.440 --> 56:24.800
We don't take the rules too seriously

56:24.800 --> 56:25.840
because there's a lot of them

56:25.840 --> 56:27.200
and we did not take the time to learn them.

56:27.200 --> 56:27.920
Maybe listen to us.

56:27.920 --> 56:30.560
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.280
You can find us on iTunes or on Maximumfun.org.

56:33.280 --> 56:52.800
I think this promo's a critical hit.
