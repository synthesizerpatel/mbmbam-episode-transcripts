WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.480
What's her bit? What's her thing? Christmas creep?

00:46.480 --> 00:57.840
Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving... You still like that, huh?

01:00.720 --> 01:07.680
It's Whack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. Whack Friday is the day after Thanksgiving

01:08.720 --> 01:14.720
when you go shopping for more weed. I guess that is pretty Whack. Yeah,

01:14.720 --> 01:18.260
I mean they do the weed dealers all sort of get together to you know

01:18.260 --> 01:25.540
The problem is whack Friday is sort of bled over into what I almost call it Thanksgiving, but that's a different holiday altogether

01:27.860 --> 01:33.780
Is it I hear that they blend bled over into Thanksgiving and now they're doing all their deals then and it's like these weed dealers

01:33.780 --> 01:36.260
Should be with their families disappointing them. Mm-hmm

01:37.780 --> 01:40.460
Yeah, I think we started yeah, okay

01:40.460 --> 01:47.020
Hold open that cold open. I'm Justin macro. I'm your oldest brother here. My brother my brother mean if I show from the modern era

01:47.060 --> 01:53.760
I'm Travis macro. I'm your middle is brother. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy coming to you hot and live and loud

01:54.180 --> 01:56.880
Raw and real it's my brother my brother me

01:58.140 --> 02:03.280
Thanksgiving is behind us. Whack Friday is behind us was also two days ago. Yes

02:03.820 --> 02:07.060
Leon that creep now. It's wait what happens on Monday?

02:07.060 --> 02:11.080
a moot moot moot ring Monday. No, that's nothing

02:13.820 --> 02:15.820
Is there a thing that happens on Monday?

02:16.300 --> 02:20.460
Yes, I bring it is it's it's when Monday is reboard

02:21.260 --> 02:28.060
From the ashes of Monday. There's a new electronic Monday that has all the emotions of Monday

02:28.060 --> 02:34.260
But new robotic parts, it's called cyber Monday. It's called cyber Monday is a liquefied

02:34.260 --> 02:38.860
They called it liquefied the organic material that used to compose

02:39.540 --> 02:46.060
Monday drank it for energy fuel and now it's turning it into I don't know like a fun robot dance or something

02:46.060 --> 02:53.960
And now is this Monday more effective because it lacks like the the fear and hesitancy of human Monday

02:54.660 --> 02:58.580
Cyber Monday is judge jury and executioner. Yeah

02:58.580 --> 03:06.380
um, our only hope is our only hope is to send Thursday back in time to Sunday to try and kill it before it's

03:07.180 --> 03:13.340
When it when its mom was pregnant with it Sunday is Monday's mom. Okay, you guys know who really hates cyber Mondays

03:13.700 --> 03:15.700
I'm gonna

03:15.700 --> 03:18.900
Garfield cyber Garfield absolutely hates. Yes

03:20.420 --> 03:22.420
Crossover

03:23.820 --> 03:27.460
Okay, I every every news story you see is

03:27.460 --> 03:32.660
That everybody's shopping online now Amazon comm oh man

03:32.660 --> 03:39.820
I read that I read that on the times the true North Pole. That's Amazon comm I went to the mall on Saturday

03:40.540 --> 03:47.060
Everybody's still at the mall. I think they're gay on Amazon at the mall because everybody's still there

03:47.220 --> 03:51.540
You can't get a job there to save your life. Everybody's still at the mall you joke

03:51.540 --> 03:56.020
But even like ten years ago not ten eight year when whenever I worked at Best Buy

03:56.020 --> 04:01.520
People would come in look at the thing and while standing there like holding in their hands be like, yeah

04:01.520 --> 04:07.240
I do want to buy this they put it back pull out their smartphones and order it from Amazon to have it shipped to their

04:07.240 --> 04:08.460
house

04:08.460 --> 04:13.860
Amazon changed the game. They have a thing on their app where you literally like take a picture of the thing

04:13.860 --> 04:15.860
Yeah, and Amazon's like, oh, yeah, I know what that is

04:16.740 --> 04:19.920
Buy it for you. Oh, I got that way cheaper. I got this

04:19.920 --> 04:23.100
Yeah, I doing that and I do not a small business here in Austin

04:23.100 --> 04:27.740
They don't they won't allow it every time you do that Jeff Bezos like kicks in the door

04:27.740 --> 04:30.480
It takes a dump right there on that small business floor

04:38.220 --> 04:43.180
It's symbolic you're just opening the door for Jeff Bezos to come in and add insult to injury or

04:43.540 --> 04:48.640
More specifically to add poop to the small business floor, but you think if he was trying to punish retailers

04:48.640 --> 04:53.240
Jeff Bezos would pick a corporate location if only for a time-saving

04:53.720 --> 04:56.000
Maneuver because the word would get out quick, right?

04:56.000 --> 05:00.520
If Jeff Bezos took a dump in one Best Buy all the Best Buys would hear about that

05:00.520 --> 05:05.600
But if he goes to Darren Steve's electronic world, he's gonna like he's got a long day ahead of him

05:05.600 --> 05:10.920
But pooping a different electronic mom, but I know he's like Santa Claus but for a very bad gift

05:11.600 --> 05:15.720
No, really that means put a lot of small businesses out of business now. They're just smalls

05:15.720 --> 05:23.200
Do you think Elon Musk is trying to make all the rockets and stuff so he can make Santa Claus real

05:23.640 --> 05:31.240
That's something that I've thought about a lot. Maybe his endgame is to make the dream of Santa Claus like a real thing on earth

05:32.800 --> 05:34.800
Start over

05:38.400 --> 05:42.040
Musk it's doing like, you know space stuff

05:42.040 --> 05:50.360
SpaceX guys. Elon Musk is not a not a perfume scent. Now. Elon Musk is like the boss of Tesco and

05:50.920 --> 05:53.520
Tesla and not Tesco the British

05:54.320 --> 05:56.320
but rather Tesla

05:56.320 --> 06:03.140
And he's like into like SpaceX and all this kind of stuff. So my theory is that he's trying to make the dream

06:04.040 --> 06:05.400
Claus

06:05.400 --> 06:08.380
He's trying to become a true true Santa

06:08.380 --> 06:14.860
That's TRU S a NTA for true Santa with his different electronics advancements

06:15.420 --> 06:21.420
Elon Musk is trying to become true Santa and and actually like do the Santa thing in our

06:21.620 --> 06:27.580
Life, that's why the hyperloop is exit. That's why SpaceX. That's why all electronic cars

06:27.580 --> 06:34.460
That's why it's also important to him because he's going to make Santa real Justin. Can I say that theory 100% bulletproof?

06:35.340 --> 06:37.340
Santa for real Elon Musk

06:37.340 --> 06:41.200
Um, can I also say we're doing a night record, which we almost never do

06:41.740 --> 06:44.820
Which opens up the possibility that Justin might be drunk

06:49.340 --> 06:51.340
Everyone's Santa to be real

06:53.420 --> 06:57.240
Elon Musk Elon Musk had his time where he's like I he took a

06:57.800 --> 07:02.140
Long look at that deep dark shift from areas that I can make Batman real I can make Santa real

07:02.140 --> 07:08.220
I could definitely get one of these done. Yeah, every rich person's doing Batman these days. Like that's

07:11.300 --> 07:13.300
Is he gonna put on some weight

07:13.660 --> 07:14.660
Seems important, huh?

07:14.660 --> 07:21.420
like why why go through all the the trouble of inventing a rocket sleigh and a hyperloop and all that shit and

07:21.620 --> 07:25.340
Like not seal the deal by putting on those Santa Claus with an E

07:25.340 --> 07:30.520
Well, that's the thing Griffin is like the the horrible truth that he has to face is to do all this work and then realize

07:30.520 --> 07:36.460
That really what he was doing is he was setting it up for the next person that this was not his it was not his

07:36.460 --> 07:39.940
Place to become Santa. It was merely his place to facilitate

07:40.780 --> 07:43.360
for the Santa is person

07:43.720 --> 07:50.580
Welcome to my page for a new new web series the Santa is person fuck web series. We can get this on cable

07:50.580 --> 07:54.700
Are you kidding me this reality show of casting Santa starring your host Elon Musk?

07:54.700 --> 08:01.420
I just feel like in this cyber world we need to move faster than we can with traditional media and this needs to be like

08:01.420 --> 08:03.580
a minute-by-minute live stream update

08:04.460 --> 08:08.660
Like yeah, like it's more like you're just watching this the different Santa's compete

08:09.860 --> 08:16.480
24-7 until last man standing. I'm just saying the traditional more traditional advertising models are still the most profitable. So

08:16.480 --> 08:22.120
It's me, okay, listen salary this is a good show

08:22.120 --> 08:26.840
There's a salary on the line of 1 million dollars a year. Okay, and

08:27.560 --> 08:29.400
One day of work

08:29.400 --> 08:33.840
Yeah, I know who's gonna cheer me or something like that. I got a I got a yule coming up

08:33.840 --> 08:38.360
So he's got a Elon Musk's got to find the truth Santa to your USA NTA

08:39.280 --> 08:41.280
True Santa and

08:42.080 --> 08:44.080
Can we go ahead and put our seal on that

08:44.080 --> 08:50.800
True. Yeah, I don't think my obscure channel acceptable TV reference is gonna be a very good title for that

08:50.840 --> 08:52.840
So we're gonna go a true Santa

08:53.120 --> 08:55.120
And it's Elon Musk

08:55.120 --> 08:59.440
Find the man with or woman with the true or in between it doesn't matter

08:59.440 --> 09:04.360
the gender is not as specific to the Santa myth will all compete for the

09:04.880 --> 09:08.720
Right to become the true Santa and Justin one one. Are you ready?

09:08.720 --> 09:13.800
When we get to season five, we enter robots into the equation

09:14.600 --> 09:18.000
Only one season because he said to forever Santa Claus

09:18.000 --> 09:22.800
He will see or they as Tim Allen has proven that no one gets to be Santa forever

09:23.480 --> 09:26.480
Is it did they do a Santa Claus for starring somebody else? I?

09:27.120 --> 09:30.440
Mean not yet. Okay, so you're just full of horse apples that it sounds like well

09:30.440 --> 09:36.400
But there was another Santa before him Griffin. It's not like he was Santa Claus and it's oh shit. It's an aura Boris

09:36.400 --> 09:39.040
Yeah, he was the Santa he pushed off the roof

09:39.720 --> 09:42.240
What would be some of the challenges on?

09:42.560 --> 09:49.080
Elon Musk's bowl full of jelliness. That's past right? I want we need active like a race or something

09:49.080 --> 09:52.620
Oh who's like who can fit the most kids on their knees at one time?

09:53.080 --> 09:57.040
Yeah, mm-hmm kid based stealth is definitely gonna be like up there

09:57.920 --> 09:58.960
reindeer

09:58.960 --> 10:05.320
Like reindeer acquaintance like how how how compatible are you with rocket reindeer? Yeah

10:05.320 --> 10:08.400
I mean the only test that's gonna matter right is

10:08.840 --> 10:13.520
Can you even ride in the rocket sleigh without just liquefying? Oh

10:14.240 --> 10:16.240
Like is it more of like a g-force?

10:16.640 --> 10:21.780
You know NASA kind of thing like reindeers won't be part of the equation if he could if

10:22.280 --> 10:25.120
Elon Musk could have like figured out the reindeer

10:25.800 --> 10:32.540
Conundrum like he would have had this sorted a long time ago right reindeer aren't part of it. It's hyperloop. It's Tesla

10:32.540 --> 10:35.860
It's maybe PayPal to a certain extent

10:37.300 --> 10:43.020
Paypal is works in here. You're saying true Santa once they get going so in the show

10:43.060 --> 10:46.220
The secret is they hit out they Santa for real

10:46.220 --> 10:51.700
He hits up LA or she hits up LA or they hit up LA they hit up LA done did that what that take?

10:51.700 --> 10:58.620
Oh god, two and a half hours. Oh my god. That's I'm way behind schedule to the hyperloop hyperloop, San Francisco

10:58.620 --> 11:03.400
Let's hit you all up. Oh my god, the Sun's coming up and then rocket from San Francisco

11:03.540 --> 11:09.980
Well, you have to use the are in dr. X Rockets and that is that that's the reindeer X Rockets

11:09.980 --> 11:14.740
I'm trying to incorporate the mythos into the I love this. Yes

11:15.620 --> 11:18.260
Yeah, you got to incorporate the old with the new baby

11:18.260 --> 11:21.300
That's what this is all about in this ever-changing world in which we live in

11:21.300 --> 11:29.420
Okay, like and then like in a shitty like modern Wizard of Oz they would call the teleporter like this is the wizard

11:30.020 --> 11:36.140
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, like oh just hop on the twister. That's not what we're calling it Steve like that

11:38.500 --> 11:44.300
Should we do some advice? Yeah, what the fuck is this show? Yeah. What is this show about? Are we doing it?

11:44.860 --> 11:46.860
Here's good news 13 minutes

11:46.860 --> 11:54.300
down the toity my friends got married in Vegas a few months ago and are having a party because their families are forcing them to

11:54.300 --> 11:59.780
Celebrate the nuptials they insist on not getting them a gift, but all my other friends are getting them gifts

11:59.780 --> 12:04.980
Anyway, should I honor their requests or should I just get them a gift so I don't look like a cheapskate?

12:05.460 --> 12:08.220
That's from giftless in the Great Lakes State

12:10.820 --> 12:16.100
You know what notice I mean I'm gonna notice and you have a perfect excuse for not doing it

12:16.100 --> 12:21.140
I did I there are I'm not gonna say they don't notice people getting a gift some say they won't notice

12:21.660 --> 12:26.500
Someone not getting them again. Well, you know what the big hiccup is here the real like when people get married

12:26.500 --> 12:28.860
There's a reason you register for shit

12:28.860 --> 12:35.540
So people don't all get you like six blenders when you already own a blender like so this like I get these people

12:35.540 --> 12:38.220
We're like we already have too much stuff like when we did ours

12:38.580 --> 12:43.860
We mostly were like, please just like give money to our like honey fun so we can pay for our honeymoon

12:43.860 --> 12:48.580
So maybe what you want to do is like a gift card that says like hey

12:48.580 --> 12:51.620
I care about you use this whenever you want to get whatever you want

12:51.620 --> 12:58.500
I think a gift quite like rarely do I advocate to the gift card because again, I said it all well

12:58.500 --> 13:02.500
The gift card says I couldn't think I don't know you well enough to have gotten you something myself

13:02.500 --> 13:03.700
But here you go

13:03.700 --> 13:08.100
But I feel like this is the perfect opportunity to say like hey, I didn't get you something

13:08.100 --> 13:12.860
I got you the opportunity for you to get you something. I don't enjoy gift card gifts

13:12.860 --> 13:15.420
No, I feel like they're giving me a chore

13:15.980 --> 13:19.940
They every gift card should say hey bad news. You've got a good

13:23.260 --> 13:25.060
It should come

13:25.060 --> 13:28.680
gift each gift card should come floating in a

13:29.100 --> 13:34.900
single size serving like a water balloon full of gasoline and for me it would I would need diesel and

13:35.540 --> 13:39.220
It I would have that and they'd be like this is you pop this in your tank

13:39.220 --> 13:44.740
You explode this right in your tank and you get the amount of fuel that you need to drive to Lowe's and back

13:44.900 --> 13:49.020
He will spin the gift card floating inside the diesel at Lowe's now

13:49.020 --> 13:51.580
They're gonna smell the gift card and they are not gonna want to take it

13:51.580 --> 13:56.340
Also, the paint's gonna come completely off of it because diesel she's a she's a hungry fluid

13:56.900 --> 14:00.100
You have not given me a gift card to Sears

14:00.340 --> 14:06.180
What you've given me is a year of buying things at other stores and then on the drive home thinking

14:06.180 --> 14:10.780
Ah, damn, I should have got this at Sears. I got that gift card and everything

14:10.780 --> 14:12.300
I should have gotten this at Sears

14:12.300 --> 14:14.020
but

14:14.020 --> 14:19.740
They've also gotten you the joy of when you open a drawer and you find that gift card and you find that it hasn't expired

14:19.740 --> 14:26.060
And not a pirate's booty. Well, yeah the feeling of potential that arises off of a non-expired but forgotten gift card

14:26.060 --> 14:28.980
He's like, oh my god, I could do anything with this. Well, yeah

14:28.980 --> 14:36.620
but never done this done the move where you find an unexpired gift card and you think you do the all right, bud

14:36.700 --> 14:41.380
You're coming with me. Let's do this and it goes in the wallet like a prominent place

14:41.500 --> 14:48.740
So I I'm definitely gonna get to an AMC theater very very in the very near future. You're top slot here friend

14:50.820 --> 14:55.860
Your perseverance has paid off Lowe's gift card my faves when you roll it to Lowe's you're like, ooh

14:55.860 --> 14:59.940
I have a gift card. I mean, I'm gonna buy this drill and you buy it like sir

14:59.940 --> 15:03.100
There's only 71 cents left on this gift card. You're like, I

15:03.860 --> 15:10.500
Know what don't look like I'm made out of 71 cents a bunch of them do it do it. Take it

15:12.140 --> 15:14.140
The guy behind you who

15:14.660 --> 15:21.540
Guy behind you who is made of several pennies a couple of nickels is what's wrong with being?

15:21.540 --> 15:27.500
Made of 71 cents and then the Skittles logo comes up and that's the end of the commercial

15:30.420 --> 15:34.380
Running off the rails this yahoo was sent in by

15:35.820 --> 15:41.660
Brooks Oglesby, thank you Brooks. It's by yahoo answers user John who asks

15:44.620 --> 15:49.580
Recurring nightmare. I am on a Nickelodeon game show. I have a recurring nightmare

15:49.580 --> 15:54.700
I am on a children's game show like you can't do that on television or guts or legends of the hidden temple

15:54.700 --> 16:01.060
I always lose and sometimes drown in the green slime parentheses GAC. Thanks shithead

16:02.580 --> 16:09.580
Was that stuff called I am NOT a child but all the other contestants are I have been having these streams about five times a

16:09.580 --> 16:12.660
Week for three months. I feel pretty happy in my life

16:12.660 --> 16:14.460
So I'm not sure why I should be having these dreams

16:14.460 --> 16:21.180
They children are very mean and mocking and usually cheat to team up even with my adult strength and size

16:21.180 --> 16:27.220
They win looking for some interpretations or advice on how to not have these dreams anymore. I'm sick of them

16:28.300 --> 16:35.260
Was you can't do that on television a game show? Yeah, I don't think there was a competitive. There was not a competitive

16:36.060 --> 16:42.900
No, and I'm sorry and just another point of order as long as we're getting pedantic GAC and slime are two different things

16:42.900 --> 16:46.420
Yeah, slime is not GAC and GAC is not slime. GAC was a much more

16:47.980 --> 16:52.540
Non-Newtonian. Yeah. No if you drop that shit on a child if you drop like a big bucket of GAC

16:52.540 --> 16:55.760
They might actually die because it's a slower child

16:56.480 --> 17:00.440
Probably couldn't dig their way out of that of that hearty thick cream

17:00.440 --> 17:07.060
Yeah, but but but slime I think was just like water and flour and like yeah

17:08.140 --> 17:09.860
and what

17:09.860 --> 17:21.740
Sorry, Justin. They dumped GAC on Rosie O'Donnell. They dunked slime on Rosie O'Donnell annually at the Kids Choice Awards

17:21.740 --> 17:24.440
You're telling me that you're telling me that Rosie O'Donnell walked away

17:24.940 --> 17:29.020
she strolled back down that red carpet back to her limo at the end of each night smelling like

17:30.060 --> 17:35.180
Nickelodeon slime farts and then agreed to come back the next year and then would come back next year. She liked it

17:35.180 --> 17:42.480
What I'm saying is the farts were in it. Now, here's my question if you guys could get every night

17:42.860 --> 17:50.380
Virtually transported to the set of your favorite Nickelodeon game show and the only price you had to pay was some gentle mocking from children

17:50.500 --> 17:57.100
Wouldn't that be worth it? I would love I would love to be transported the set of Double Dare for example. Let's do this

17:57.100 --> 18:00.920
What was your what's your favorite? It's not favorite. It's not favorite. It can't just be favorite

18:00.920 --> 18:05.680
It has to be which one you think you would own bones at and for me, it's Legends of the Hidden Temple

18:05.840 --> 18:12.020
Because that show was about a big statue face. It would be like the princesses chambers had three statues

18:12.020 --> 18:15.000
How many statues to the princesses chamber have in it?

18:15.740 --> 18:20.300
Yes, Jiffy two. No, not two

18:22.380 --> 18:28.000
I'm a giant face cleft from stone. You should really be listening to what I'm saying

18:28.000 --> 18:33.200
What else are you paying attention? What could possibly be more interesting in the room than me?

18:33.200 --> 18:33.800
Yeah

18:33.800 --> 18:36.720
Have you noticed that phenomena if you watch old Nick game shows?

18:37.040 --> 18:41.880
About half the kids do seem pretty distracted a lot of the time like oh, yeah. Yeah

18:42.640 --> 18:46.800
I uh, I do think it's a legit fear though because I bet that

18:47.920 --> 18:49.920
You did not get very good

18:49.920 --> 18:58.040
Explanations of the rules like think about how well you understood like so I have to dig between the two giant waffles and

18:58.360 --> 19:00.360
Find a yeah

19:01.960 --> 19:03.960
Yeah, exactly that's exactly it

19:05.400 --> 19:08.680
From a Christmas story just kicking you back down the slide. Yeah

19:09.280 --> 19:12.300
Go find the flags. That's why half the time on legends

19:12.920 --> 19:15.480
At the very end the big stone face is like, all right

19:15.480 --> 19:19.880
You're gonna go through the jungle kick over the third tombstone climb down under that tombstone jump in the second

19:19.880 --> 19:24.640
Hole you want to climb that rope and then turn right and then you're gonna press a button to open up the secret door

19:24.640 --> 19:27.720
To the shrine of the silver monkey

19:27.720 --> 19:33.400
And then you're gonna put that shit together backwards in reverse order and then go back the way you came but turn left at the jungle

19:33.400 --> 19:36.500
And finally you'll find yourself in the scarabs hiding place

19:36.720 --> 19:42.400
You got all that go nuts and they forget room one they get to the jungle like well fuck that was way too much too

19:42.400 --> 19:49.000
fast I would bet money that at every recording of legends of the hidden temple a shadowy figure like slughorn from

19:49.000 --> 19:49.500
a

19:49.500 --> 19:56.480
Willy Wonka would like sneak into the kids dressing room and be like I'll give you a hundred dollars if you forget how to put

19:56.480 --> 20:02.040
Together a monkey because like what are the odds that like every kid comes in and is like wait, where'd the feet go?

20:02.040 --> 20:04.040
God, yeah shit

20:06.680 --> 20:13.740
Like they they had to be doing like I don't even know that $100 is gonna spin so good. Yeah way better than a Casio keyboard

20:13.740 --> 20:20.620
Maybe this is happening all over if you were a contestant on the bozo super sunday show a slug

20:20.620 --> 20:27.100
We're type figure entered your dressing room said hey listen if you take a big chokeski throwing a ping-pong ball into the first bucket

20:27.100 --> 20:32.140
I'll give you 20 bucks. You're not gonna make it to the end anyway. What do you want that for?

20:33.700 --> 20:35.780
Mr. Slughorn can I ask why why?

20:37.420 --> 20:40.160
Why do you want us to perform poorly in bozos games?

20:40.160 --> 20:46.340
because every time a kid does well it extends the length of the show and the cubbies are on later and I want to make

20:46.340 --> 20:47.980
Sure, I don't miss any of the game

20:47.980 --> 20:53.920
You're saying the bozo super clown show was of a variable length and the same could be said of legend long

20:56.780 --> 21:00.100
Spiffin you're out Spiffin you're not in this one. Sorry, but you know

21:01.400 --> 21:04.980
Why are all these voices that ghost of Christmas passed from Scrooged?

21:04.980 --> 21:11.300
I do you not think that there was like there have been like bozos is a I

21:11.620 --> 21:13.620
Agree with you that bozo is a face length

21:13.740 --> 21:18.980
But you know what's pretty rad is if you think about how long that show ran there was probably a few days like listen guys

21:19.660 --> 21:25.500
We have seven minutes until the Cubs game starts, and we have nothing we have nothing planned

21:25.500 --> 21:29.060
You just have to go out there and clown or something of pies

21:29.060 --> 21:35.660
Who has is it some without cards? I don't I haven't I haven't done that since college you can do this bozo

21:35.660 --> 21:42.900
Oh look at this kids. I'm making a pile of whipped cream on the floor, and then oh oh oh oh oh

21:44.220 --> 21:48.660
Oops, I stepped in it oops stepped in the whipped cream

21:50.020 --> 21:52.100
Floor and we're out. Thanks for watching everybody

21:52.980 --> 21:57.580
He comes back and somebody drapes like a cape and like a thing of roses over his shoulders

21:57.580 --> 22:00.300
And he's like I didn't know I could clown like that. I feel alive

22:00.300 --> 22:02.400
Maybe I'll kiss my wife for the first time in ten years

22:03.020 --> 22:06.180
What if you did tune in to bozo and it was like?

22:06.980 --> 22:14.020
253 and you just saw a man in a cloud costume just strutting in a circle singing this is McClellan song

22:14.580 --> 22:20.820
Come on a clowning walk with me your favorite clown bozo seven minutes of that watch

22:20.820 --> 22:27.900
How watch the silly way that a clown ties his shoes rip rip rip over and over?

22:29.060 --> 22:32.980
Somebody have a TV guide that I could read out loud

22:37.340 --> 22:43.620
Reads another question yarn spinner. I'm a college student who is house hunting for the first time in my life

22:45.060 --> 22:50.100
Previously my parents chose which apartment I lived in but now the rains are in the hands of my roommates

22:50.100 --> 22:55.980
And I fortunately find in a house or apartment that's closed to campus and within our budget is a lot more difficult than we were

22:55.980 --> 23:04.060
Expecting any tips for house hunting in a city with an extremely overvalued housing market almost homeless in Austin. Oh

23:05.300 --> 23:09.020
Austin is expensive, isn't it Griffin? I mean, it's not just expensive

23:09.020 --> 23:13.580
It's it's like Hunger Games style competitiveness to get that we lost the house that we got

23:13.740 --> 23:17.860
The house we got we were the backup offer on and they beat the shit out of us

23:17.860 --> 23:21.900
And it's not I say beat the shit out of us. The only rule of that game is

23:23.220 --> 23:25.220
Write a bigger number than the other people

23:26.100 --> 23:29.740
But boy, howdy did they dunk did we get dunked on?

23:31.100 --> 23:35.140
But hey, it all worked out in the end. It's rough man. I can't imagine doing that as a student

23:35.140 --> 23:37.540
Is it rough renting to is renting is back

23:37.540 --> 23:43.660
Oh, yeah, dog when we the house we moved to this house from the house. We were renting before we owned this house

23:44.460 --> 23:46.460
we were one of

23:46.460 --> 23:47.660
11

23:47.660 --> 23:53.700
Applicants that they were considering and we had to like sit down and meet them and then you know, we wrote them a letter

23:54.540 --> 23:55.940
that was

23:55.940 --> 24:00.980
There were that I made a tasteful new drawing of myself and attach that and just said whatever you want

24:00.980 --> 24:05.220
And that helped her hurt it. I mean we've got the place didn't we? Well, I

24:06.140 --> 24:12.100
can say we just finished house hunting here in Los Angeles where it is also quite expensive to live and

24:12.100 --> 24:19.940
I I mean we had to go look at like 30 different places in two weeks and every place we went to there was like

24:19.940 --> 24:22.200
Eight other people looking at it at the same time we were

24:22.980 --> 24:26.660
And and the key is like just if you like it apply right away

24:26.860 --> 24:31.340
Like just get you know get your name in there as soon as you can, you know

24:31.760 --> 24:38.260
Check out as many places that you can like have a variable budget that helps a lot if you can like don't say

24:38.260 --> 24:44.620
Yeah, you gotta keep in mind. Hi, you know, yeah by those how high you gotta liquidate the correct assets

24:44.620 --> 24:48.020
You got to keep in mind that there's a billion other people like you who are doing the same thing

24:48.020 --> 24:50.540
and if you think of the mindset of just like how can I

24:50.860 --> 24:56.000
Get around those people or beat those people like maybe you go a little bit just a little bit outside the bubble

24:56.000 --> 25:01.540
It's a little bit outside where you're comfortable doing and you'll find like a really really nice spot or you get on Craigslist

25:01.540 --> 25:07.200
you refresh that shit every 30 seconds and you email the people when the place you want goes up like instantly and maybe

25:07.200 --> 25:08.320
a

25:08.320 --> 25:12.200
Drawing and a noodle doodle. What about this? Yes, maybe

25:13.200 --> 25:19.640
Expand your concept of what constitutes a house in quote-unquote. Okay

25:21.220 --> 25:23.480
To be continued, it's Perry white

25:25.240 --> 25:31.880
So maybe an affordable cave or parking structure or someone else's garage, yeah

25:31.880 --> 25:40.240
Um, yeah, it's many pizza boxes many pizza boxes. I mean, what's your what should I put down?

25:40.240 --> 25:45.360
I want to invite you to our wedding. We're getting married in February very excited about it. What's your address?

25:45.360 --> 25:50.000
Oh, just write many pizza boxes on an envelope and then give it to a bird a

25:50.480 --> 25:56.000
Bird, huh? Yeah, just a secret to the bees any bird will do cuz they'll smell these boxes

25:56.000 --> 26:01.840
We did not we were not diligent about cleansing them of sauces and like the de-cheese

26:02.800 --> 26:06.640
Solution that we bought at the family dollar was not as effective as it

26:07.480 --> 26:12.960
Super good. In fact, it just added a sort of bird attractive scent that is

26:13.440 --> 26:19.560
Implaceable we have contacted Ralph Nader and the Better Business Bureau and the Better Business Brewery man

26:19.560 --> 26:21.560
They whip up a fresh IPA

26:21.560 --> 26:28.040
In all seriousness know what really helps is pick pick a pick a neighborhood because things are getting a little bit

26:28.640 --> 26:33.360
Funny pick a neighborhood that you want and just drive around and look for for rent signs

26:33.400 --> 26:36.020
Because if you go through a service or a website or something

26:36.160 --> 26:43.240
You want to catch something that comes on the market quick like maybe just like you like predator like predator

26:43.240 --> 26:48.040
Let Justin let Justin make jokes. He's bored of his question. Let Justin make jokes

26:48.040 --> 26:51.040
Go ahead Justin

26:52.920 --> 26:57.240
Catch something on the market and then I just said like a predator like catch

26:58.540 --> 27:00.540
Like to catch a predator

27:01.320 --> 27:03.320
Okay, see isn't that better?

27:06.520 --> 27:08.360
Aren't we all happier now

27:08.360 --> 27:14.120
I mean except for like the three people that were trying to buy a house in Austin and we're taking furious notes

27:14.120 --> 27:16.360
But other than them, I think everyone's doing very well

27:16.360 --> 27:18.940
Shoot us an email if you want to know my realtor

27:20.080 --> 27:25.640
She's a she's a man. She's a beast. She she tore shit apart. She's a bear

27:26.000 --> 27:29.960
She's actually a living bear and not a dead bear. Should we go to the money zone?

27:30.880 --> 27:38.000
Yeah, we've certainly earned it this time. You say that half the time people obviously are consuming our product week in week out

27:38.560 --> 27:40.560
even if it's

27:42.200 --> 27:44.200
Climbed into your fucking

27:44.200 --> 27:45.640
X

27:45.640 --> 27:51.600
careening jet of a question and try to pull up pull up pull up my third in some catch a predator jokes

27:51.600 --> 27:53.600
Just try keep this shit float

27:55.600 --> 27:59.880
Yeah, sorry, I said sorry my metaphors got mixed maybe if I had some more money

27:59.880 --> 28:14.680
I wouldn't be so distracted. My metaphors would be more on point C male confidence confidence competence

28:17.880 --> 28:20.880
We got a new sponsor to kick things off this week it's club

28:21.760 --> 28:26.000
W so let me tell you this works. It's a it is a wine club

28:26.000 --> 28:31.160
That's what the W will get together. They complain about stuff. It's better than that

28:31.840 --> 28:34.000
There's no interacting with other people who like wine

28:34.320 --> 28:40.000
You just go to club w.com and answer six simple questions and then they've got an algorithm

28:40.480 --> 28:46.960
That creates a palette profile just for you now and then they send the wine directly to your door perfectly customized to match your taste

28:47.000 --> 28:49.960
Here's the neat thing about that. Like yeah, I went through this process

28:50.800 --> 28:55.680
They don't it's it's kind of pointless for me who doesn't know a lot about wine to say, you know

28:55.680 --> 29:01.360
I want a pinot noir. I want a pinot grige or I want some Chardonnay. I don't know what I want

29:01.360 --> 29:03.360
I have no earthly idea

29:03.360 --> 29:08.880
Their questionnaire asks you things that you actually do have like a reference point for stuff like like how do you take your coffee?

29:08.880 --> 29:12.080
Do you know do you like it creamy or do you like it black or you know?

29:12.080 --> 29:17.120
Do you like what kind of fruit pies do you enjoy that kind of thing? Have you ever killed just for the fun of it?

29:17.120 --> 29:19.420
Yeah, have you ever killed just for the fun of it?

29:19.420 --> 29:26.120
What and then it has some fun money Python joke references like that whole land speed of a swallow thing that's in there, too

29:26.120 --> 29:27.960
It's great a little bit everything

29:27.960 --> 29:33.000
That's not but it it is questions that you might actually have a reference point for even if you don't drink a lot of wine

29:33.040 --> 29:36.800
They are leading the grape to glass wine revolution

29:36.960 --> 29:42.040
And that is a fancy way of saying that they actually work with people who are making wine and they don't have a mill

29:42.040 --> 29:45.840
Man, it's just like get it from those people and then they bring it to you the labels look cool

29:45.840 --> 29:49.640
what I like best about it is that the

29:50.000 --> 29:55.640
Wine comes with an informational card that explains to you sort of like grapes are in it where it's from

29:55.800 --> 30:01.160
Flavor profile that kind of thing so you can read the card and then if you have a party with people over you can hide

30:01.160 --> 30:06.040
The card and just seem really smart about the wine and not just that let me say it like this sounds like one of those

30:06.040 --> 30:09.800
Like super expensive of the month clubs, right where you're like

30:09.800 --> 30:13.380
Oh, I'd love to do a steak over the month club or whatever and then it's like $50 a steak

30:13.380 --> 30:20.060
This is like so reasonably like if I may if I can let you in on a secret that you would find by going to the

30:20.060 --> 30:22.620
Website it's like $13 a bottle

30:22.620 --> 30:27.420
They have a no risk 100% guarantee that they'll love what you send you if you don't love it

30:27.420 --> 30:33.100
They'll make it right. So don't even don't even trip on it right now Club W is offering in BMA limit centers

30:58.860 --> 31:04.700
Podcast version of the six questions that they ask to discern what your wine tastes are

31:05.740 --> 31:09.380
So I can do you guys want me to bounce it off you two? Yes, please. Yeah

31:09.380 --> 31:10.860
um

31:10.860 --> 31:15.100
It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet. How do you react?

31:18.180 --> 31:25.420
Um, I probably stroke it awkwardly but intensely and thank them. Oh shit your delight

31:25.420 --> 31:29.700
Oh, no, sure. Well, okay. Good news. Travis is an Android Justin is not. Oh

31:30.380 --> 31:37.040
No, well, wait a minute that this is not inform our wine. My brother my brother means also supported in part this week by Harry's

31:37.040 --> 31:42.260
They've got a limited edition holiday shaving set. Here's what it comes with copper plated razor handle

31:42.260 --> 31:46.780
That's gonna look good a couple of five blade cartridges. That's gonna feel good shaving cream

31:46.780 --> 31:50.660
That's gonna smell good and a cool travel kit to hold everything that's gonna taste good. Probably

31:51.460 --> 31:57.820
Yeah, come on. You don't don't eat the travel kit. This is not us. I don't hate it. God. No, don't eat it

31:57.820 --> 32:00.900
Just taste it a little. Okay, that's fine. It's a good bag

32:01.940 --> 32:05.840

You're by your bed. Oh, no, it's smooth, but they're so comfortable. Don't worry about my genitals, right?

34:41.120 --> 34:43.920

35:00.880 --> 35:02.880
They're shaped like a dick

35:02.880 --> 35:08.840
It's so it could be shaped like a dick and feel smooth. All right, stop and read these questions

35:08.840 --> 35:13.760
Who is this message for Andrew Johnson? Who is this message from? It's from I think it's for everybody

35:13.760 --> 35:19.080
Well, it's from Eleanor Haskin, but we'll say it's for everybody like the duct-tape bandit

35:19.080 --> 35:22.560
You've stolen my heart between the Mothman Festival and Disney World

35:22.560 --> 35:28.740
I guess we fell in love but I still know no one could wish you a better birthday than your favorite brothers

35:28.740 --> 35:31.200
Yeah, that was some tight-ass West Virginia lore

35:32.360 --> 35:37.320
Have we talked about shit? I forgot about the duct-tape. Yeah, we talked about Casey Kazee and his perfect crime

35:37.320 --> 35:42.920
No, I was thinking of the Sticky Bandit. I was way off. No duct-tape bandit was Casey Kazee

35:42.920 --> 35:46.240
He conducted the world's only perfect crime. Look it up. Google it

35:46.800 --> 35:48.800
To this day. Nobody knows his name

35:50.020 --> 35:56.540
Yeah, I know his name because I was him for Halloween and that was a good slash bad hurtful costume hurtful to my face

35:57.240 --> 36:03.440
Duct-tape wise and we have another personal message. This one is for Matt always alone Jones

36:03.440 --> 36:07.640
Oh, and it's from Sophie well-fit Johnson

36:08.320 --> 36:13.520
You wished me. Happy birthday. Well, I'm about two months late for yours, but baby, I'm late

36:13.520 --> 36:20.080
I'm not pregnant out obviously sex is involved but poo poo poo. I'm drunk. I can't really afford this

36:21.680 --> 36:29.300
Can't wait to see you in November. Whoops. I hope you're less hideous than when last I saw you hashtag drunk purchase

36:30.040 --> 36:31.280
Yes

36:31.280 --> 36:35.040
We should have this is fucking all time

36:36.080 --> 36:42.800
There should be standard. We should have some sort some sort of a breathalyzer or something

36:43.640 --> 36:49.840
They're going to oh man. I know we're turning on jumbotrons folks some sort of confirmation email

36:49.840 --> 36:55.540
They're just driving their car less than a like whoa, this person sounds drunk. Whoever this was. I sure feel bad for them

36:55.540 --> 36:59.160
Oh, no, it's me. Ah, man. That's damn it

36:59.160 --> 37:01.040
Definitely ballin

37:01.040 --> 37:02.680
I was I was about to say like yeah

37:02.680 --> 37:06.780
We should make you like a tattoo parlor where you come in you can't get a tattoo if you're drunk except she

37:07.520 --> 37:10.920
Used words on our show. So it's like she gave us a drunk tattoo

37:12.080 --> 37:14.960
That's true. They make us say that the words

37:15.520 --> 37:23.120
Amazing. What if it was a tattoo parlor that where you came in drunk and then the tattoo artist had to give themselves whatever tattoo

37:23.120 --> 37:29.980
You came up with can't do a Popeye, but just the bottom half what okay?

37:32.240 --> 37:38.200
Do Popeye, but he's fighting a dragon and the dragon is my mother

37:39.320 --> 37:41.620
Yeah, but she's got Popeye's face

37:42.440 --> 37:44.440
It's like what?

37:45.080 --> 37:47.080
Pop out on the aisle no

37:47.080 --> 37:53.000
I'll get it underneath it in block letters

38:01.720 --> 38:05.760
But spell it Pearl Jam and with Sanskrit

38:08.800 --> 38:10.800
I've sobered up by this

38:10.800 --> 38:16.600
I listen. I'm dead sober now, but I still I I've been playing this tattoo for months

38:17.280 --> 38:21.880
And it's for you again. Just to restate again. I've looked at I've been

38:21.880 --> 38:27.160
I've been scoping your body out for months trying to think of the perfect tattoo and I think what we've landed on which is

38:27.240 --> 38:32.800
Popeye's bottom half fighting a dragon shaped like my mother and then underneath that in Sanskrit radio had spelled Pearl Jam

38:32.800 --> 38:35.280
I think that we've really split

38:35.280 --> 38:37.280
Price

38:38.800 --> 38:43.640
Let's be honest we live in a world with too much media you need a podcast on the front lines figuring out

39:10.840 --> 39:12.480
You guys want Yahoo?

39:12.480 --> 39:13.800
Yes

39:13.800 --> 39:14.920
No

39:14.920 --> 39:20.600
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Rosin formerly Rachel Sperling the name done changed

39:20.600 --> 39:28.280
But the game still recognizes the game and it's still a gerund. I think she deserves a new moniker like game changer

39:29.280 --> 39:31.480
game changers fine, but I still like

39:31.480 --> 39:35.720
Game but recognize I still think she wants the game recognized. Oh

39:36.520 --> 39:41.480
Game changer recognize get no game recognize game changer too much too much too much. Mm-hmm

39:41.480 --> 39:45.360
It ain't there. It ain't broke. Don't don't fix it Rachel Rosen game recognized game

39:46.280 --> 39:49.100
It's by Yahoo answers user Turtha who asks

39:51.100 --> 39:54.240
How do I make something look like an old man was saying it

39:54.240 --> 40:01.280
What I am writing. I am writing a web novel. There is an old man there. I want to make his dialogues

40:01.640 --> 40:03.920
To seem like an old man was saying it

40:04.240 --> 40:10.300
Give me some suggestions on how to tweak general dialogues to make it seem like an old man was saying them

40:10.920 --> 40:15.440
So it's nano rhyme Oh for the next when this comes out

40:15.440 --> 40:31.440
14 hours How do you write a book I don't read a lot of books I mainly just you know play Bloodborne all day

40:32.800 --> 40:36.480
So like in a book if there's an old man in a book and I know there's not a lot

40:37.000 --> 40:41.440
How do you power that the writers of the book make it like when you're reading it?

40:41.440 --> 40:46.440
How do the writers make it like when you're reading it? You'd be like doll. That's an old person saying that well

40:46.440 --> 40:53.040
I know okay. So the one thing I know about old people speak old speak. Yeah is they talk real slow, right?

40:53.080 --> 40:59.000
They talk like they got nowhere to be so maybe one word per page. That's two

40:59.000 --> 41:05.680
That's probably I'm gonna go and separate their publisher probably won't approve that just because price-wise. How about one word per line?

41:06.600 --> 41:08.960
Is better meet me in the middle

41:08.960 --> 41:13.440
Two words per page two words per page, I guess would be meeting you in the middle

41:14.080 --> 41:18.240
All right, all right. I feel like I won this negotiation shit

41:19.760 --> 41:24.540
How do you make it look like an old man was saying it can you make the can you make the pages?

41:25.080 --> 41:31.960
Where the old man has dialogue in it smell like an older man nice

41:33.160 --> 41:35.040
So the book like old man in the sea

41:35.040 --> 41:39.360
They would not even put down in library shelves anymore or they put it in a special room

41:41.040 --> 41:43.440
That was you know hermetically sealed

41:44.640 --> 41:48.680
Be wait because it smells like an old man and the sea well

41:48.680 --> 41:52.800
No, it only smell like an old man, but I imagine there'd be a lot of books that are like old man

41:52.800 --> 41:54.800
Just all over them

41:55.080 --> 42:02.040
Most Dickens books I imagine would be like, oh welcome to the Dickens room. Yeah, it's it smells like the Dickens. Oh, man

42:02.040 --> 42:03.840
Yeah, it's not great

42:03.840 --> 42:06.640
It's not great. You just shot like a tiny

42:08.360 --> 42:13.680
Spider webs between the double L's and the double R's and stuff. Oh, I like that

42:14.520 --> 42:18.080
What about coming so you make the words in the shape of an old man?

42:19.880 --> 42:22.220
It's gonna take some doing yeah

42:24.680 --> 42:30.760
Like those greeting cards that play music and just every time you open to a page where it has old man dialogue on it that

42:30.760 --> 42:36.400
Auto plays like just a general moan from an old man. Like you open you turn to page 61 and it's just like

42:38.240 --> 42:39.640
And then you know

42:39.640 --> 42:43.360
Make you write a program perhaps in Q basic or some other sort of software

42:43.800 --> 42:50.160
Where every five words it would just insert open bracket cough close bracket just every five words

42:50.160 --> 42:55.000
So just insert a cough in there because he's coughing. He's old that works for me

42:55.000 --> 43:00.200
Um and the webs thing too. What about like just all in caps?

43:00.760 --> 43:08.040
Lie for that. Well, he's an angry old. It's specific to an angry. Yeah, but I mean even when older folks get angry

43:08.040 --> 43:13.440
They're still older and they're like throats don't work as good. So they what about all in caps with a smaller font? That's

43:14.200 --> 43:19.680
Working for me gonna lose a little bit of that spiderweb effect though. I think I think I'm really just sort of stuck on

43:19.680 --> 43:21.680
this idea stinky books gang

43:21.680 --> 43:23.680
I

43:24.080 --> 43:25.600
Introduce that

43:25.600 --> 43:28.920
The problem is I've seen I feel like it's a slippery slope

43:28.920 --> 43:29.320
Okay

43:29.320 --> 43:34.560
Where do you stop when you do like the Sun also rises and you turn to a page and it smells like a bullfight

43:34.640 --> 43:39.560
Right. Like where do you stop? Where is that? Where do you draw the line? Where's the line drawn for stinky books?

43:39.560 --> 43:44.200
I need to back up for me because for the first time in literally 13 years

43:44.200 --> 43:50.260
I actually wanted to read a book what you just described for me is a sensory experience that I would love to have

43:50.260 --> 43:52.600
Yeah, we're talking about 4d books fellas

43:53.200 --> 43:58.600
This is it. This is the fourth. This is dance for smell. Yeah, this is our little mention of smell

43:58.880 --> 44:05.000
Listen, I saw page master when I was a little kid and those books came to life. It's probably talking on it. What's that?

44:05.720 --> 44:07.320
That's well

44:07.320 --> 44:10.520
No, the movie didn't have it. It was not a for you didn't see it in sense around

44:10.520 --> 44:14.080
No, you're getting no all both of you are getting confused about a lot of things

44:14.080 --> 44:23.200
I saw page master. I was a little boy and I was like, I want that whoopee Goldberg becomes a romance novel or some shit

44:24.040 --> 44:27.920
That's not how that movie happened. I don't think there was a romance all the characters like yeah

44:33.120 --> 44:35.240
Yeah, necromancer did to watch the movie

44:35.800 --> 44:42.600
Anyway, I've never had an experience like that where a book came to life and took me with it to somewhere away from the library

44:42.600 --> 44:45.160
And my mom came back was like, where did Griffin go?

44:45.760 --> 44:48.080
Books took him away again. Yeah, damn it

44:49.240 --> 44:52.700
I want that though, and I feel like smells gonna get me there

44:53.280 --> 45:00.200
Yeah, it's like a my my fucking eyes and brain and reading comprehension certainly have not done it yet

45:00.440 --> 45:02.440
Let's get my nose in the mix

45:03.200 --> 45:05.540
That would be a rough temptation though

45:05.540 --> 45:10.040
Like if you're if you're an author who's cranking out a lot of books like you're Stephen King's or whatever

45:10.040 --> 45:14.240
You there would be a temptation to maybe lean on this new technology a bit like listen

45:14.240 --> 45:19.640
I don't know how I don't know how to spice this story up. We're just gonna look the smells take it from here

45:20.520 --> 45:22.880
Get yeah, get our best smell guy on this one

45:22.880 --> 45:25.960
See if he could punch it up a bit cuz I got nothing. I got no closer

45:25.960 --> 45:32.800
I got no act three got no day tomorrow rising action. You're putting in too much effort into it in authoring new works

45:32.800 --> 45:39.400
I'm saying we return no classics. I mean he's with this for deed Charlie in a chocolate factory. Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up?

45:39.400 --> 45:43.040
That I think when Roald Dahl wrote that shit. He was like mmm. This is gonna be perfect

45:44.040 --> 45:46.040
sticky boy

45:46.040 --> 45:51.880
With me like you wrote that a fever dream waiting for 4d technology and here I am

45:52.440 --> 45:57.240
But Griffin what about like you're so excited because you get to like your favorite book three musketeers

45:57.240 --> 46:02.840
You get to read it in 4d for the first time you open. I'm like, oh shit everything in France and England

46:02.840 --> 46:06.860
So why are you only thinking about the fat stuff sticky boy?

46:06.860 --> 46:13.060
Come with me to my book of pure candy smell tasting

46:15.220 --> 46:20.740
This whole book smells like Oompa Loompas you're thinking of the worst part of it chocolate boy

46:21.260 --> 46:23.060
Come to town

46:23.060 --> 46:26.180
Smell my book and then take it to daddy

46:28.380 --> 46:32.340
What really sad thing is that Roald Dahl thought this technology already existed

46:32.340 --> 46:34.780
So every time he'd watch him and read one of his books for the first time

46:34.780 --> 46:40.460
He just sort of raised his eyebrows expectation every few pages like tell me about the stars very road

46:40.460 --> 46:44.020
Your book is a masterpiece. You don't even fucking get it yet

46:44.980 --> 46:50.780
You're not even reading it right yet. Live in it. I've been wondering why all the Roald Dahl books

46:50.780 --> 46:57.740
I have have a smell disk sleeve in the right near the jacket. Apparently. He's just future-proofing them

46:59.220 --> 47:01.220
Sticky boy, that's

47:01.220 --> 47:06.820
Yeah, that's gonna be caught my head. That fakes all you came up with.

47:06.820 --> 47:11.740
Yeah, I like we can move on to another question, but it like while we talk about like, you know

47:12.340 --> 47:13.860
Somebody's shitty roommate or something

47:13.860 --> 47:18.260
I'm just gonna be thinking of how this 4d technology could completely change the landscape of book technology

47:18.620 --> 47:21.460
if you not I don't I don't want to put the I don't want to

47:22.580 --> 47:27.620
Muddy the waters by talking about this in movies, but for some reason I'm always like

47:27.620 --> 47:33.020
I had a really intense fear of the scene in Wonka where

47:33.500 --> 47:36.380
Gene Wilder gets really angry at me. Yeah

47:38.020 --> 47:40.020
Well, it feels that way doesn't it and

47:40.300 --> 47:46.900
I always get this really intense fear about that scene and I just wanted to mention that like I'm glad this technology doesn't exist for

47:46.900 --> 47:49.420
that because I bet that kid between like

47:49.420 --> 47:56.980
angry heavily acting Gene Wilder and some old suits that they definitely rented from like a

47:57.580 --> 48:03.380
Funeral parlor or something and like the sets and all the like candy that he has like under his fingernails and stuff

48:03.380 --> 48:05.740
I bet there was like some intense smell

48:06.340 --> 48:08.660
Action going on for young Charlie Bucket that day

48:08.660 --> 48:12.740
I did not have to put too much energy into crafting a performance

48:12.740 --> 48:16.780
I doubt Charlie Bucket was a was a shower a day kid

48:16.780 --> 48:18.780
Yeah

48:18.780 --> 48:24.740
Joe has just climbed out of his bed of filth for the first his bed of filth and by the way lies

48:25.020 --> 48:27.260
He's been fine this whole time. Yeah

48:28.540 --> 48:30.860
About the lies. I know he absolutely can't

48:31.580 --> 48:33.500
Okay, but like and he smells bad

48:33.500 --> 48:36.420
I do want to say you're talking about 4d Charlie and

48:36.580 --> 48:42.020
the scene you brought up was the scene where Gene Wilder gets mad at some children in a tunnel and not a scene where a

48:42.020 --> 48:48.580
Little boy and an old man burp on each other for 45 minutes. I don't want to talk about that stank

49:03.220 --> 49:05.500
Yeah, he's a nightmare I hate his guts

49:05.500 --> 49:12.540
I wish he would have gotten chopped up in that fan

49:14.300 --> 49:15.780
When he left I

49:15.780 --> 49:21.740
Guaranteed grandma Josephine and the two other old people in the same bed were like we can all agree

49:21.740 --> 49:27.220
We hate him the least right like we're so fucking glad he's gone. Yeah, I hope he dies in a fan

49:28.100 --> 49:32.380
Dolls original title for Charlie chocolate factory was sad cabbage boy prays for death

49:32.380 --> 49:35.140
It's the original thing. He wanted to call it

49:36.860 --> 49:38.980
Sad cabbage boys candy contest

49:42.420 --> 49:44.420
Asterix to fix this in editing

49:46.460 --> 49:48.700
No to self think of better title

49:50.700 --> 49:53.520

58:51.200 --> 58:56.640
It's like the monsters of metal tour only quieter. No music and just talking

58:56.640 --> 59:00.760
