00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.280
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, the advice show for the

00:47.280 --> 00:52.080
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.840
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:55.840 --> 01:03.200
It's an exciting week for martial basketball. We got us, we, the herd, me and the guys,

01:03.920 --> 01:12.080
got into the finals, the NCAA basketball finals for the third time ever and won our first

01:12.080 --> 01:18.880
ever NCAA finals game. Hey, go herd. We are marshal. You know what? I've been thinking

01:18.880 --> 01:25.680
about it. We are marshal. Last night, the herd was thoroughly drubbed by WVU to the surprise of,

01:25.680 --> 01:30.560
oh, probably a few diehards, but like not me personally because I kind of suspected that,

01:31.600 --> 01:37.520
that, you know, that full court press. You know, but we thundered, we thundered right to second

01:37.520 --> 01:41.280
place in that match and that's how I like to think. In each basketball match, there's a first

01:41.280 --> 01:46.160
place and a second place and you can't feel too bad about second place. But I don't bring you guys

01:46.160 --> 01:50.960
here to talk about. What are we talking about? I don't want to talk about being in the paint and

01:50.960 --> 01:57.120
dunkaroos and all the great basketball lingo. I want to address something that I don't know how,

01:57.120 --> 02:01.680
it's kind of weird that we haven't addressed on this program before and I wanted to bring it

02:01.680 --> 02:08.720
before you now. Are you two, my brothers, aware that the name of the coach of the thundering herd

02:09.760 --> 02:19.360
is Dan Dan Tony? Wait, question. Are you aware of the fact that the coach of the thundering herd,

02:19.360 --> 02:27.200
the basketball team in our hometown, and we have never brought this up, the man's name is Dan

02:27.200 --> 02:34.880
Dan Tony. Okay, is it Dan? Yes. Separate word Dan, separate word Tony, like Tony, Tony, Tony?

02:35.520 --> 02:43.680
No, it's as though his name is Dan, first name Dan, last name, capital D, apostrophe, capital A,

02:43.680 --> 02:49.680
N-T-O-N-I. It's like a fantasy version of if his name wasn't just Dan Dan Tony.

02:49.680 --> 02:54.240
He's an adventure zone NPC who we had a hard time naming.

02:55.360 --> 03:00.880
This is like a Bond James Bond kind of thing. Well, no, it'd be a James Bond.

03:02.000 --> 03:11.600
That's right. Dan Dan Tony. Dan? Dan Dan Tony. Dan. Dan Dan Tony.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.360
He's three men, and that's what makes him so great at coaching basketball. As we all know,

03:17.360 --> 03:26.240
a full basketball team is three people, and he can just sort of divide. His Alar is so strong.

03:26.240 --> 03:31.680
He divides his mind into three parts, and one is thinking about passing. The other one is thinking

03:31.680 --> 03:35.680
about catching and shooting. The third one is thinking about blocking the defenders,

03:35.680 --> 03:41.440
and he's a whole team in there in that brain. You seem a little off Dan Dan Tony.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.520
Yeah, Dan too is thinking about lunch. You know how it is.

03:46.960 --> 03:56.240
Now, I wanted to say that if he was the head of a crime family, he would then be Don Dan Dan Tony

03:57.280 --> 04:01.840
is one thing I wanted to say is he would be Don Dan Dan Tony. Now, if he was the head of

04:01.840 --> 04:08.000
a professional crime family who fought his way there by achieving a high rank in a martial art,

04:08.000 --> 04:14.880
then he could be 5th Don Dan Dan Tony.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.920
But that is his plan as I've gotten.

04:17.920 --> 04:24.960
But also, if he had written a Broadway musical that won some kind of award, he could be Don

04:24.960 --> 04:27.840
Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner.

04:27.840 --> 04:39.920
That is very good. He could be 5th Don Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.400
I think that's all the Dan Dan Tony I have.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.200
You think we could get more? Do you think we could get more?

04:47.200 --> 04:59.680
If he was also a hat, you could say to someone Don 5th Dan Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.200
Yes, that's one thing you could say.

05:02.160 --> 05:10.800
If he was in an early 90s hip hop group that created the hit single If I Had No Loot,

05:11.600 --> 05:15.840
he could be and also was the other shit in the joke that I've already forgot.

05:15.840 --> 05:23.280
He could be Don Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner of Tony Tony Tony.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
I think that's as much as we can squeeze in there.

05:27.280 --> 05:34.640
If you were only permitted to wear him at daybreak, then one thing you could say is

05:34.640 --> 05:40.880
at Don Don 5th Don Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner of Tony Tony Tony.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.000
That's it, end of joke.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.400
And if that was a little bit too much, then you could say yours again, Justin.

05:48.400 --> 05:57.280
Okay, at Don Don 5th Don Don Don Don Tony Tony Tony award winner of Tony Tony Tony.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.360
And tone it down. Tone it down.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.280
That's too much.

06:02.560 --> 06:08.080
All right, so that was a very good joke about a college basketball coach

06:08.080 --> 06:12.240
who is probably going through one of the worst days of his life right now.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.800
But hey, he should feel good about their performance.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.560
Nobody expected him to get that far.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.000
Congratulations to the herd.

06:20.000 --> 06:28.480
Congratulations to at Don Don 5th Don Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner of Tony Tony Tony.

06:28.480 --> 06:28.960
Tone it down.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.880
So should we get the advice or we could talk more.

06:34.880 --> 06:39.040
We I'm interested in talking more about college basketball if we want to sort of circle back

06:39.040 --> 06:44.480
to the who's remaining in the NCAA tournament and just check out.

06:44.480 --> 06:49.120
Thank you to everybody who submitted their questions for our special project.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.600
We think that's going to be episode 400 probably.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.880
Maybe yes.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.520
We did a weird we had a weird day last.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.880
We had a weird day last week and you will be privy to it all.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.120
But for now it's 398.

07:01.120 --> 07:06.480
So let's just ruminate in the the castle of sand that we've built for ourselves.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.280
Here we go.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.120
Now I will just a quick preference.

07:09.120 --> 07:15.040
This first question was of a question question, but I feel like it's it's fairly universal.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.640
So I included it here in our regular episode.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.280
I've made a habit of designating Saturday as my personal day of rest and self-care.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.200
So the Bible says Bible says Bible says do that.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.880
Bible says treat yourself on the Sabbath.

07:28.880 --> 07:34.400
Well, it's been great, but sometimes I struggle to turn off my power switch robot.

07:34.400 --> 07:38.800
So I still want to robot alert everybody shut down the show.

07:38.800 --> 07:43.440
I still want to look at my emails, look through Twitter for horrible news, do chores and read

07:43.440 --> 07:47.280
watch things that I feel like I'm supposed to read slash watch instead of things I actually

07:47.280 --> 07:48.080
enjoy.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.120
I know some cultures have rituals that mark their day of rest, but I don't want to be

07:51.120 --> 07:52.160
appropriate.

07:52.160 --> 07:57.760
I do, however, want to send my brain the signal that it's OK to be chill for a day.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.320
Suggestions as from tired and jittery in Jersey.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.880
Can you buy a second phone?

08:03.680 --> 08:10.240
That's sort of off-court buddy, a weekend phone, a weekend phone for Saturday and Sunday.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.880
And on this phone, you delete a few essential apps.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.160
The first you want to get off there is Twitter, of course.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.720
And then if you really want to go whole hog, maybe just go ahead and take that off the

08:22.720 --> 08:24.800
old working week phone as well.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.360
Holy shit.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.160
I've just had a million dollar idea.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.200
Maybe a billion dollars.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.360
You could just let Griffin finish his bad idea, apparently.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.960
His non-million dollar idea.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.400
Well, Griffin gave it to me.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.920
Just let yours accrue some interest.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.080
Let me finish my six dollar idea.

08:44.080 --> 08:44.560
OK.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.600
The second app you want to delete off your phone is phone.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.120
Nobody needs to get a hold of you on Saturday.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.680
Nothing important ever happens on Saturday.

08:53.680 --> 08:58.640
And then I, to be honest, I had other stuff, but I feel like the wind's really been taken

08:58.640 --> 08:59.440
out of my sails.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.440
This is my weekend phone.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.880
It doesn't do phone.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.000
It doesn't do Twitter.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.840
And it has all the different kinds of Angry Birds installed right on it.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.000
And they're happy birds because it's weekend.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.680
I even got a legal download of Flappy Bird on here.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.920
My cousin Rick put on it for me.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.840
So thanks, Rick.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.600
So here's my idea.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.400
It's an app for your phone.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.760
That is like Twitter.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.160
But when you go to it, it just generates good news and tells you there's nothing going on

09:28.160 --> 09:29.520
and go back to what you're doing.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.040
And I call it Fritter.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.680
This is, this is, so two things.

09:35.680 --> 09:42.080
One, you think that the valuation of this idea is one million dollars.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.360
Maybe even two million.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.120
The second thing is that you thought it was worth interrupting my six dollar.

09:47.120 --> 09:47.920
Well, because think about it.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.920
So you get the impulse to check Twitter, right?

09:49.920 --> 09:52.720
You go to Fritter and it's just like, yeah, nothing's happening.

09:52.720 --> 09:59.040
So like you get, it's kind of like, you know, the nicotine gum of Twitter.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.600
So you get your fix of going and checking Twitter.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.400
But it's just all good news and like nothing's going on.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.360
And you're like, oh, okay.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.080
And then you can go.

10:06.080 --> 10:10.080
And maybe Fritter also just like you program in times and it just shuts down.

10:10.080 --> 10:14.320
It puts your phone in airplane mode from like a certain time to a certain time.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.840
And you can't unlock it.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.340
Yeah.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.560
I mean, there's lots of ways that we can handle this.

10:18.560 --> 10:23.920
We could just do a version of Twitter that every time you click on a tweet,

10:23.920 --> 10:27.520
interact with a tweet or whatever, a Venga bus starts playing,

10:27.520 --> 10:31.440
but it gets twice as loud with each sort of interaction you have.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.800
And after a while, it'll destroy your home.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.680
It'll destroy the sound waves coming from your phone will blow up your house.

10:37.680 --> 10:42.480
And so you can't, you just will be like, okay, that's enough.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.960
I looked at three tweets and it's already like, I can't, I'm done.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.640
I can't, I'm done.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.200
There's nothing.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.880
Is that the name of that song?

10:50.880 --> 10:51.520
Yes.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.880
I didn't know it had a name.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.020
Yeah.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.400
I just thought it was like one of the old ones.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.520
It's just like a, wait, what?

10:59.520 --> 11:01.200
Like one of the old ones, like Cthulhu.

11:02.000 --> 11:02.800
Okay.

11:02.800 --> 11:07.120
I love how hard you hit that word.

11:07.120 --> 11:07.840
I've been sick.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.200
Yeah.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.040
You got to take care of yourself on the weekends.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.560
I just looked, I've gone five days recording this on Monday.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.400
I've gone five days without tweeting.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.480
God almighty, it feels good.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.160
Hey y'all, hey y'all listen.

11:22.960 --> 11:27.600
I love interacting with y'all on Twitter and I love hearing from everybody.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.680
And I read what you say from time to time.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.720
Everybody delete Twitter from your phone right now.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.240
Stop listening to this and get rid of it.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.440
You will be fine.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.720
Do it on your computer.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.560
You do it on your computer, but you come to Twitter when you're ready for it.

11:42.560 --> 11:47.760
Don't let it be like fucking in you, on you, around you, inside you,

11:47.760 --> 11:50.720
in your lungs, in your brain, fucking 24-7.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.760
That was one of my favorite things about being on the cruise, being on the Joku.

11:53.760 --> 11:59.040
It was like my hand would go to Twitter and it was like the universe,

11:59.040 --> 12:03.120
the cruise was saying, no, I'm not going to let you do this, Travis.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.680
I'm not giving you internet right now.

12:05.680 --> 12:12.320
And I would instead interact with my friends in real life and like my wife

12:12.320 --> 12:14.800
and myself and the world around me.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.760
Gross.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.480
I know.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.680
You would interact with.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.520
I interacted with myself.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.040
All right.

12:21.040 --> 12:21.920
What do you mean?

12:21.920 --> 12:22.880
Sea pervert.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.080
One thing that also will actually help with this,

12:26.080 --> 12:28.400
I don't know if you're into meditation at all,

12:28.400 --> 12:34.960
but that could really help to give you control back over like the impulse.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.720
Like to, it'll make your actions a lot more deliberate, I think.

12:38.720 --> 12:44.080
Even like 10 minutes of focusing on your breathing in and out in a relaxed position,

12:44.080 --> 12:46.880
you're going to be a lot less compulsive, I think,

12:46.880 --> 12:50.960
because a lot of what you're reacting to is like just lizard brain habit

12:51.920 --> 12:53.120
that you do during the week.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.760
So I think try a little bit of meditation to start today

12:56.480 --> 13:02.560
and you may find you have a bit more control over the impulse to do some of this stuff.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.000
And also plug your phone in and walk the hell away from it.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.840
You'll be, the other shocking thing is how frequently like my desire to look at Twitter

13:11.840 --> 13:14.720
is outweighed by my desire to not stand up.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.880
It wins out every single time.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.440
We need to, I feel like maybe recalibrate

13:19.440 --> 13:22.640
because we just did a bunch of really good advice there and not jokes.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.200
And people kind of, and they expect us to be like forward.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.400
Dan Tantoni.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.000
Forward on your phone and then you won't want to touch.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.040
I assume they're still laughing about the Dan Tantoni stuff.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.560
They needed some time to catch their breath.

13:32.560 --> 13:36.080
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by level 9,000 Yajuru Drew at Drew Davenport.

13:36.080 --> 13:36.560
Thank you, Drew.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.720
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

13:38.720 --> 13:41.680
but I'm going to call them Tony Tony Dan Dan asks.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.120
That sounds like a fun nickname for Tony Danza.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.240
Tony Tony Dan Dan asks.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
Magic to have a brother or sister.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.760
And this is the first one of these I think I've ever seen

13:53.760 --> 13:55.840
that doesn't have a fucking question mark at the end of it.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.520
And it's freaking me the fuck out.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.360
I thought that was automatically generated.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.480
I do not know how this person has hacked the Yahoo Answers service

14:02.480 --> 14:04.400
to get rid of the question mark,

14:04.400 --> 14:06.800
but it just says magic to have a brother or sister.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.160
Anyway, if you don't believe in magic, move on.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.040
Wow.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.800
How do you, how do you magically, how do you-

14:12.800 --> 14:13.600
I'm still here.

14:13.600 --> 14:13.840
Yep.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.040
How do you magically make your parents have a baby?

14:17.040 --> 14:18.560
What spells can I use?

14:18.560 --> 14:19.120
I see.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.400
Magic to have a brother or a sister.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.480
And you don't want to make a homunculus, of course,

14:26.480 --> 14:29.920
because you could lose your arm, your leg, or your whole other brother.

14:29.920 --> 14:30.960
And that's a, and I'm telling you-

14:30.960 --> 14:33.680
But then you get a big like metal brother and that's fun.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.440
It's not ideal, I'm just saying.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.920
But he's like impervious to damage.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.760
Yeah, but he can't, you know, interact with himself.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.960
Listen, if you're trying to get a brother or sister,

14:45.600 --> 14:48.160
you don't want to just do an even trade by,

14:48.800 --> 14:50.880
you know, sending your other brother through the door.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.160
Truth lasts forever.

14:52.160 --> 14:52.960
That's true.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.400
That's what I know about this.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.520
So be careful.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.760
You can give your, you could gift your parents

14:57.760 --> 15:00.560
an all expenses paid weekend at beaches.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.000
And that is a kind of magic.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.480
It's going to be worked on them in a big, big way.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.080
Once they aren't worrying about buying their own cocktails,

15:08.080 --> 15:13.520
the right sort of music comes on, the rhythm of the waves.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.600
And I think your parents are going to be making love

15:16.880 --> 15:17.920
before you know it.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.840
And maybe use, magically use telekinesis to remove

15:21.840 --> 15:26.560
from their luggage, their Jimmy caps.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.240
Just right before they go out the door,

15:28.240 --> 15:33.520
use that Matilda magic to just abscond with those Jimmy caps.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.920
Hey, how come the kids never give the parents the talk?

15:37.920 --> 15:39.200
You ever think about that?

15:39.200 --> 15:39.680
Yeah.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.480
Yeah.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.920
Just kid sits down and parent.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.200
Listen, I want to tell you something.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.520
It's going to blow your mind, dude.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.200
Maybe you could also,

15:47.200 --> 15:49.200
how old do you think that this question asker is?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.320
Hmm.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.880
I would rather not sort of,

15:53.920 --> 15:58.880
I need to cover fire of a lot of different possible ages

15:58.880 --> 16:00.320
that I could pretend I was assuming.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.120
If they're young enough,

16:01.120 --> 16:03.680
they could steal a baby and then not be tried as an adult.

16:03.680 --> 16:04.560
So like-

16:04.560 --> 16:05.440
That's not magic.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.160
That is not magic.

16:06.160 --> 16:06.880
That's not magic.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.320
Well, if they did like,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.400
press a vegetation to steal the baby

16:10.400 --> 16:12.320
and did like some like,

16:12.320 --> 16:13.680
look over here, poof.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.720
And then they were gone with the baby.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.360
That's magic.

16:16.960 --> 16:17.600
Yeah.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.480
Yeah.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.720
And then what they say to the parents

16:20.720 --> 16:22.640
when they bring home this baby that's not theirs?

16:23.200 --> 16:25.120
I found it in the fairy glen.

16:26.160 --> 16:26.640
Okay.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.200
So that's not gonna fly.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.360
Well, if the parents don't believe in magic,

16:31.360 --> 16:32.080
they can move on.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
Are you sure you want a brother or sister?

16:35.840 --> 16:38.400
Listen, I have a five week old.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.000
It's a lot.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.120
Are you sure you want to put that on your parents?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.560
Like they have,

16:44.560 --> 16:48.960
you talk a big game about wanting a magical brother or sister,

16:48.960 --> 16:49.600
but like,

16:49.600 --> 16:51.360
are you gonna put in the hours

16:51.360 --> 16:53.120
to like change the diapers and everything?

16:53.120 --> 16:54.080
Question asker.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.520
I'm not sure that you are.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.400
No, of course not.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.280
That's not magic.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.680
But Justin, don't you like having brothers?

17:01.280 --> 17:02.400
No, I do.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.680
They're very profitable.

17:05.920 --> 17:11.200
My whole career is based on this whole fraternal energy

17:11.200 --> 17:12.080
that we've built here.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.280
And I'm, and if you guys,

17:13.280 --> 17:14.960
if anything happened to you guys,

17:14.960 --> 17:19.440
I don't know how my net worth would ever recover.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.840
That's a weird thing to say if you're deep in debt,

17:21.840 --> 17:22.160
isn't it?

17:22.160 --> 17:22.960
My net worth.

17:24.480 --> 17:28.000
Do you think that musical artists who create doing it songs,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.960
like how does it feel by D'Angelo?

17:30.960 --> 17:32.080
Untitled, how does it feel?

17:33.280 --> 17:37.200
That is a kind of spell to create more brothers and sisters.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.880
Yes, D'Angelo is like a bard.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.720
Music engages like every part of your brain.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.360
It's the closest thing to magic that we have here on this planet.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.200
Yeah, I mean, that song in particular

17:47.200 --> 17:49.680
just grabs me right by the donk, right by the donk.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.800
We always put it in our pre-show playlist

17:52.800 --> 17:58.240
and I'm not positive what we're trying to achieve with it,

17:58.240 --> 18:00.080
always being in there, but.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.760
I mean, it's a slammer and it's a jammer

18:01.760 --> 18:02.560
and there's no denying that.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.720
Yeah, but we bookend it with like,

18:04.720 --> 18:08.240
you know, fun song, fun song, doing it song, fun song, fun.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.600
Like, well, yeah.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.440
Well, yeah, I mean, Justin's into some weird like fucking ska zydeco

18:13.440 --> 18:16.160
that is just a real hog slayer.

18:16.160 --> 18:19.760
So we put that in there right after the how does it feel.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.840
Just remind people they are at a comedy show

18:21.840 --> 18:23.200
and it's not an appropriate place

18:23.200 --> 18:25.040
to magically create a new brother or sister.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.200
But if during that time period, like, what is it?

18:28.080 --> 18:30.480
Untitled is what, four and a half, six minutes long?

18:30.480 --> 18:31.440
It's like six minutes long.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.960
Yeah, six minutes long, yeah.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.080
That's fine.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.760
That's like, you're good.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.600
More than enough time.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.920
I'm deeply uncomfortable.

18:39.920 --> 18:40.800
How about another question?

18:41.680 --> 18:42.400
You got it, baby.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.880
My mom and I often go out to eat together.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.600
I enjoy spending the time with her, except one thing.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.240
My mom insists on bringing her own condiments

18:52.240 --> 18:54.800
and I don't just mean ketchup packets.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.300
Bruh.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.240
As if that would be acceptable.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.400
If we're going to a place like Arby's,

19:00.400 --> 19:03.280
she'll bring Ziploc bags full of her own pickles.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.400
Bruh, why do you want us to dunk on your mom?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.000
Why do you want us to dunk on your mom?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Why have you done this to your mom?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.160
Tomatoes she doesn't like the ones they have.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.040
Oh my God.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.440
And the things like salad dressing, ketchup,

19:15.440 --> 19:17.040
barbecue sauce, et cetera.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.280
She'll often bring sauces from other fast food places

19:19.280 --> 19:20.160
that she likes better.

19:20.160 --> 19:20.640
Bruh.

19:20.640 --> 19:24.080
She also brings baggies full of candy and cookies for dessert.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.560
Oh my God.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.360
Why do you offer your mom up as tribute?

19:29.360 --> 19:29.680
This is-

19:29.680 --> 19:31.440
She says that this is all perfectly normal

19:31.440 --> 19:33.760
and no one in the restaurant will notice her doing this.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.560
It's not they do.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.920
It's not perfectly normal.

19:35.920 --> 19:36.720
She knows that.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.880
Your mom's fucking with you if she thinks it's normal.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.560
Your mom's welcome to do whatever she wants.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.400
She's an accomplished lady and a mom and a hardworking woman.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.160
She knows that this is messed up.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.600
Should I be embarrassed to be seen with this picnic arrangement

19:49.600 --> 19:52.880
or is she right that it's no big deal?

19:52.880 --> 19:53.200
Help!

19:53.200 --> 19:55.280
That's from Condiment Crisis in Tennessee.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.440
There's, oh my God.

19:57.440 --> 19:58.720
There's two parts to this.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.520
One, your mom is a flavor pioneer

20:03.520 --> 20:06.560
and she's on some next level shit and-

20:06.560 --> 20:08.160
Why don't they have pickles at Arby's?

20:09.200 --> 20:11.600
What are you gonna fucking pair roast beef with a pickle?

20:11.600 --> 20:12.320
No.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.600
Because they're so restrained otherwise at Arby's, Griffin?

20:15.600 --> 20:16.000
Yeah, okay.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.120
They have, we have the meat.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.640
We don't have the old vegetables that we got all vinegary and weird.

20:21.280 --> 20:21.920
Okay.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.120
Your mom's on some next level shit.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.560
I will not deny that.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.040
They're like, they're but for the grace of God.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.920
I would absolutely love to bring,

20:29.920 --> 20:33.760
you know, some McDonald's ketchup to the BK

20:33.760 --> 20:36.000
because their ketchup is a fucking joke.

20:36.000 --> 20:36.800
I get it.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.320
That's the first thing.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.560
The second thing though is that this is a social crime.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.280
This is not, this is not how we do things here.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.480
Around these parts, we don't bring pickles to Arby's.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.560
As much as I would love to, we can't.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.360
And we, one person cannot sort of,

20:54.320 --> 20:59.520
that does not represent a groundswell to a social crime.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.400
Groundswell to sort of change the societal norms

21:02.400 --> 21:04.640
under which we have all been crushed.

21:04.640 --> 21:08.720
And the Arby's Corporation has invested a lot of money

21:08.720 --> 21:12.160
in making sure that their dishes taste good

21:12.160 --> 21:14.240
to the highest number of consumers.

21:14.800 --> 21:19.840
Like, where do you get off going behind Arby's back and being like,

21:19.840 --> 21:21.840
I think one thing would be pickles.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.520
Like, no, you don't actually.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.680
But what if Mr. Arby's sees that?

21:25.680 --> 21:28.000
Mr. Arby's sees the pickles and is like, pickles.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.280
Of course.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.320
Oh, it's a nothing you do situation now.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.000
But then it's like this embarrassing thing

21:34.000 --> 21:35.680
because Arby's don't have pickles.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.760
Where Arby's is like calling McDonald's like,

21:37.760 --> 21:40.400
hey guys, this is hard for me,

21:40.400 --> 21:42.880
but like, where the fuck do you get pickles?

21:42.880 --> 21:44.480
Where do you get them pickles?

21:44.480 --> 21:46.320
Where do you even get pickles?

21:46.880 --> 21:48.240
Which, which part of this?

21:48.800 --> 21:51.120
Okay, that's why they won't offer pickles, by the way.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.280
They just don't know.

21:53.280 --> 21:54.240
They take forever.

21:54.240 --> 21:54.960
We try to do it.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.120
We put a bunch of cucumbers in a barrel

21:57.120 --> 21:58.160
and it takes forever.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.200
We don't know what we're doing.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.640
We don't have time for that.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.160
We don't have time for any of this.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.720
Which, which aspect of this is more upsetting?

22:04.720 --> 22:06.560
Bringing something that the restaurant

22:07.440 --> 22:09.440
like Arby's doesn't have

22:09.440 --> 22:11.200
or bringing something they do have

22:11.200 --> 22:12.960
but you like your version better.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.120
So bringing pickles, they don't have pickles,

22:15.120 --> 22:17.920
but bringing tomatoes because your tomatoes are better.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.880
Which one of those?

22:18.880 --> 22:21.680
This is, this is mommy's special horsey sauce.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.480
I can't, I can't decide which one,

22:24.480 --> 22:26.160
if I was an Arby's employee

22:26.160 --> 22:28.320
who took a lot of pride in my work,

22:28.320 --> 22:30.160
which one I would be more upset by.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.840
You would not get the opportunity to see both.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.480
Cause if I see one, either objects we do not have

22:34.480 --> 22:37.440
or objects we do have that you prefer elsewhere,

22:37.440 --> 22:40.160
I would have called the police after the first one.

22:40.160 --> 22:40.720
You know?

22:40.720 --> 22:42.160
Maybe it's that you think

22:42.160 --> 22:45.840
like McDonald's tomatoes taste better on Arby's sandwiches

22:45.840 --> 22:48.800
but Arby's tomatoes taste better on Subway sandwiches

22:48.800 --> 22:50.800
and you're just rotating your tomatoes around.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.160
Get it together, guys.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.320
Teamwork makes the dream work.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.040
Call each other.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.560
You got the wrong tomatoes.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.720
It's a, it's a parent trap situation.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.760
I, I actually find myself the most disturbed

23:01.760 --> 23:07.360
by bringing her, like the idea of being in Arby's

23:07.920 --> 23:11.840
watching someone finish their Big Montana

23:13.040 --> 23:16.160
and then reach into their bag to,

23:16.160 --> 23:18.400
it's like the Arby's waiter comes over like,

23:18.400 --> 23:19.440
we all done here?

23:19.440 --> 23:22.400
And like, can I bring you anything else?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.680
Can I get you anything else?

23:23.680 --> 23:25.920
No, actually it's time for dessert.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.040
And then just extracting a bag of hard candies

23:29.040 --> 23:31.040
and that your mom sits there and eats

23:31.040 --> 23:32.080
in the middle of Arby's.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.520
That's very upsetting to me.

23:35.520 --> 23:39.200
I think, I cannot admit, I cannot admit.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.880
Okay, your mom knows what she's doing

23:40.880 --> 23:45.920
and this may be all to irritate you, which is great.

23:45.920 --> 23:46.720
Very good for me.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.480
Here's the, I also just want to dispel one thing too.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.320
When your mom says that no one will notice,

23:52.320 --> 23:57.200
I've worked many, many jobs in my life.

23:57.200 --> 24:01.840
And after a while, any new, any new information

24:01.840 --> 24:03.520
that comes into the place that you work,

24:03.520 --> 24:05.600
you immediately latch on to,

24:05.600 --> 24:07.600
because it's different than everyday else.

24:07.600 --> 24:12.640
So I guarantee the crinkle of a plastic bag opening,

24:12.640 --> 24:15.600
zip, like they are, they are honing in on that

24:15.600 --> 24:17.280
like a Peregrine Falcon.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.400
That is, that is, that is drawing all of their attention

24:20.400 --> 24:23.280
and they were going to talk about for weeks,

24:23.280 --> 24:25.520
the person who brought pickles into Arby's.

24:25.520 --> 24:29.280
I don't think you should rob culture of your mom.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.240
Like, I think that like if I was seated across the,

24:32.240 --> 24:34.480
I mean, I would never eat inside an Arby's.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.160
I don't understand, I don't understand it.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.920
But if I did eat in Arby's and I saw a woman

24:38.880 --> 24:40.640
using her own condiments in a,

24:40.640 --> 24:43.040
and extracting pickles from a baggie she brought from home,

24:43.040 --> 24:45.760
that would like be all I talked about for the next two days.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.600
And your mom is giving that gift to people every single day.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.520
Like she's just grinding it out

24:51.520 --> 24:53.680
and making other people's lives delightful.

24:53.680 --> 24:57.360
And like, I don't understand why we're always rushing

24:57.360 --> 25:00.080
to sort of sand the rough edges down off of humanity

25:00.080 --> 25:02.320
when it's not hurting anybody.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.880
It's just a delightful thing for everyone to enjoy.

25:04.880 --> 25:09.520
Maybe just enjoy these eccentricities of your mother

25:09.520 --> 25:11.600
because like this is a fun thing

25:11.600 --> 25:14.080
that makes your mom special to you

25:14.080 --> 25:16.560
and not something that like you need to change about her

25:16.560 --> 25:18.880
to make her more bland.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.680
But she's not stealing from the Arby's.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.960
And even if she was,

25:22.960 --> 25:26.560
now she's some kind of, you know, Arby's cat burglar.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.200
And that's also interesting in its own way.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.880
Or maybe just bring like a privacy curtain

25:33.680 --> 25:35.520
that you can put up and then whatever you do,

25:36.400 --> 25:41.280
vis-a-vis pickles and homebrew condiments behind the curtain

25:41.280 --> 25:43.600
is nobody's business but yours, your mom's and God's.

25:44.720 --> 25:48.000
There's gonna come a day when Arby's is out of ketchup

25:48.000 --> 25:49.600
and they don't have any.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.680
And it's gonna be very embarrassing for Arby's

25:51.680 --> 25:53.040
and the people there in Arby's.

25:53.040 --> 25:57.120
And your mom's gonna be like, hey, boo, do not trip.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.440
And she's gonna extract four different catch-ups

25:59.440 --> 26:00.400
for you to enjoy.

26:00.400 --> 26:04.720
And on that day, your mother will be the hero of Arby's.

26:04.720 --> 26:05.840
Now, will she share with other people?

26:05.840 --> 26:06.720
I'm sure she would.

26:06.720 --> 26:09.120
She's a very generous, particular woman.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.200
I'm sure she will share.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.480
But that day, it will all make sense.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.080
That will be your signs.

26:16.080 --> 26:19.840
That will be your swing away, Russ.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.160
This will be why it all makes sense

26:22.160 --> 26:23.280
and why it's all been happening

26:23.280 --> 26:26.320
leading to that exact moment when your mom's the Arby's hero.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.800
I do wanna say, I remember hearing on the news

26:28.800 --> 26:32.240
when KFC ran out of chicken, your mom came in

26:32.240 --> 26:36.560
like some sort of legendary samurai

26:37.200 --> 26:38.960
and came in and was like, let me get some chicken.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.160
They're like, we don't have any chicken.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.760
And she was like, oh, it's fine.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.680
And then she pulled out a big old hefty bag

26:43.680 --> 26:46.080
full of raw chicken meat that she carries with her

26:46.080 --> 26:50.080
because she prefers her raw chicken meat to KFC's.

26:50.080 --> 26:53.600
And that is the story of how she became

26:53.600 --> 26:54.720
the new Colonel Sanders.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.200
Sorry, Reba, it was a short run,

26:57.200 --> 27:02.720
but Greg's mom here needs the hat.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.720
Does Colonel Sanders wear a hat?

27:04.720 --> 27:05.840
We're not even sure.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.920
When it's sunny, a lot of people don't talk about the fact

27:09.920 --> 27:13.840
that Arby's will fry up whatever meat you bring them.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.120
A lot of times after a big day, no questions asked.

27:17.120 --> 27:20.400
A lot of times when I have a big day of fishing,

27:21.280 --> 27:24.320
I'll bring in my catch of the day

27:24.320 --> 27:26.240
and what kind of fish?

27:26.240 --> 27:29.280
What? Delicious rainbow trout.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.800
And then I'll gut it right there on the floor of the Arby's.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.480
I'll lay out some newspapers.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.360
It doesn't do anything, but I wanna look polite.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.880
I'll gut it right there.

27:38.880 --> 27:42.240
I'll slop the carcass onto the counter

27:42.240 --> 27:44.800
and I'll say, fry it up right for me, Curtis.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.120
Because Curtis is my guy at the Howgrier Arby's.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.120
Fry it up right for me, Curtis.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.640
And no questions asked.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.560
He will season it to perfection.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.000
He will scale it to an extent.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.960
You are gonna get some scales because it's still Arby's.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.760
It's just Curtis.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.200
It's just Curtis.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.240
He's doing his best.

28:02.240 --> 28:05.520
He doesn't do this a lot, but then they'll fry it up for you

28:05.520 --> 28:08.560
and make a great seafood dinner for you and your family.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.160
Man, I am thinking Arby's right now.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.400
Yeah, no, I am kind of fucking hungry.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.080
This always happens to me.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.240
Arby's, how about that sponsored episode?

28:16.240 --> 28:17.040
Yeah.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
Can you get at us, please?

28:19.840 --> 28:20.480
Come on.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.600
Everybody tweeted Arby's.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.480
I know they're down.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.400
I know they're down to clown.

28:24.400 --> 28:28.480
When the Adventure Zone arc, when the Balance arc ended,

28:28.480 --> 28:31.920
they tweeted about it with a little image they made

28:31.920 --> 28:34.720
of Arby's props dressed up as our characters.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.400
They definitely are down to clown.

28:36.400 --> 28:36.880
They know our style.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.880
Give us some money to talk about Arby's for an hour.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.840
Come on.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.720
Come on.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.920
The problem is we've been giving them

28:41.920 --> 28:43.680
all this free advertisement.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.440
We've got to withhold from it.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.080
You know what?

28:46.080 --> 28:51.040
400 to 500, no Arby's mention unless we see that cheddar.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.560
Fucking lockout.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.240
Shut it down.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.640
Or pay us in a mountain of freebie coupons

28:56.640 --> 28:59.280
that we can give away to listeners at live shows.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.200
I will accept that payment if you just sent us

29:01.200 --> 29:02.320
a mountain of coupons.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.360
Anyway.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.720
No, I would love money, actually.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.320
Money would be great, too.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.320
Half and half, 50-50.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.280
Because I think there is a sort of revenue split

29:11.280 --> 29:12.240
we do with Max Fun.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.960
And if we show up to Jesse's door with a fistful

29:14.960 --> 29:16.480
of Arby's coupons and say, like,

29:16.480 --> 29:18.560
did we do it good this time?

29:19.440 --> 29:21.840
I think he would be very disappointed.

29:21.840 --> 29:22.800
I know, Jesse.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.480
He's going to go fucking hog wild.

29:24.480 --> 29:27.040
Get some motts sticks, some potato cakes.

29:27.040 --> 29:27.840
Some Buford's.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.400
Couple Bufies.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.320
He's going to take his entire beautiful family

29:32.320 --> 29:36.640
to an all-you-can-eat buffet at Arby's of his own creation.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.240
Um, anyway.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.160
Dad's treat.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.400
This one's on the McElroy's.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.800
Everybody get all the beef you can handle.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.560
God bless us, everyone.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.280
Uh, let's go to the Money Zone.

29:51.280 --> 30:02.720
Yes, absolutely.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.520
Hey, I want to tell you about MeUndies.

30:05.520 --> 30:06.640
These are mine.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.840
They're my undies.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.040
But you can have them.

30:09.040 --> 30:09.840
You can have them, too.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.280
They're a great balance of comfortable fit

30:11.280 --> 30:12.240
and exciting prints.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.520
They use a sustainably sourced, naturally soft fiber

30:15.520 --> 30:17.120
that starts with beechwood trees

30:17.120 --> 30:19.440
and ends with amazingly soft fabric.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.480
MeUndies adventurous prints are all limited edition

30:43.120 --> 30:45.600
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.720
I also want to tell you,

30:46.720 --> 30:48.800
I want to tell you about Squarespace.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.840
Squarespace.

30:49.840 --> 30:50.880
Okay, here's the thing.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.800
I'm a big fan of Squarespace.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.640
I use it for a lot of different projects

30:54.640 --> 30:56.400
and you've probably heard me talk about that before,

30:56.400 --> 30:57.760
but don't tune me out.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.440
Please, please keep listening

30:59.440 --> 31:00.800
because Squarespace is great.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.840
It's so intuitive, easy to learn, easy to use,

31:03.840 --> 31:05.760
and easy to make a really amazing website

31:05.760 --> 31:08.240
that's going to impress both your friends

31:08.240 --> 31:10.160
and also professional people

31:10.160 --> 31:14.240
who are maybe looking to hire you or pay you for things.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.280
You can publish blogs or other content.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.200
You can sell products and services.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.480
You can announce an upcoming event or special project,

31:22.480 --> 31:24.400
which is something we use it for a lot.

31:25.120 --> 31:27.520

31:27.520 --> 31:28.880

31:31.040 --> 31:33.680
and everything is optimized for mobile right out the gate.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.160
So you don't have to do any kind of special arranging

31:36.160 --> 31:38.560
or worry about how it's going to show up on phones.

It's easy.

31:39.840 --> 31:43.520

32:10.080 --> 32:12.800
It gives listeners advice on everyday situations.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.000
Wait a fucking second.

32:14.000 --> 32:14.960
Hmm.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.720
You can find us wherever you listen to podcasts.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.680
I can't stress this enough.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.120
No one else is doing this.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.080
We're very original.

32:20.080 --> 32:21.680
We did not steal this idea.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.080
Listen to our very unique podcast, Ready Set Comedy.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.440
It's one of a kind.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.360
Okay, we may have borrowed it slightly,

32:27.360 --> 32:28.400
but it's still very original.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.640
Well, not the very first,

32:30.640 --> 32:32.640
but we didn't know that when we started.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.960
Fine, we straight up stole the premise from a Bim Bam.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.040
And it says, so very sorry.

32:37.040 --> 32:42.000
So that's Ready Set Comedy who stole our shit.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.760
You can find them wherever podcasts are

32:43.760 --> 32:45.760
and in court with us soon.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.240
So we'll see you all in court.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.320
I have a Jumbotron message.

32:50.320 --> 32:54.080
This one's for Liz Ard and it's from a secret fan.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.320
I'm very nervous now.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.600
Let's read the message.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.280
Thanks to the members of the trash heap

32:59.280 --> 33:01.120
for being a bunch of ridiculous nerds

33:01.120 --> 33:02.160
over the past year and a half.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.280
I hope the future is full of memes, role-playing discussions,

33:05.280 --> 33:08.480
and even more memes until we achieve world domination

33:08.480 --> 33:10.640
in the name of our glorious lizard queen.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.120
Oh no.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.000
Yeah.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.800
I mean, finding out about the glorious lizard queen is rough,

33:14.800 --> 33:17.920
but when anytime an anonymous message shows up on the show,

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
I get very nervous, but this was pretty benign.

33:19.920 --> 33:20.960
So thank you for that.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.840
This next message is from Joseph

33:23.840 --> 33:28.160
and it's for Tyler and the TSG family.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.480
Shout out to my boy Tyler and all of my TSG family

33:32.480 --> 33:35.680
for introducing me to the brothers through Monster Factory

33:35.680 --> 33:38.160
because they've gotten me through some very tough times.

33:38.160 --> 33:41.040
Also Tyler, you're a freak and I'm gonna eat you.

33:41.040 --> 33:45.040
Probably an inside joke.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.520
But if it's not, get out of there, Tyler.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.680
Tyler, run, run, Tyler, run.

33:49.680 --> 33:52.560
And TSG family, get out of there.

33:52.560 --> 33:53.280
Get out of there.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.400
The whole crew.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.000
Hey guys, this is Adam Conover.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.720
You may know me from my true TV show, Adam Ruins Everything.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.600
Well, guess what?

33:59.600 --> 34:02.720
Now we're doing a podcast version right here on Maximum Fun.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.440
What we do is we take all the interesting, fascinating experts

34:05.440 --> 34:07.520
that we talked to for just a couple of minutes on the show

34:07.520 --> 34:09.920
and we sit with them for an entire podcast.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.720
Really going deep and getting into the fascinating details

34:12.720 --> 34:13.680
of their work.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.320
Find Adam Ruins Everything wherever you get your podcasts

34:16.320 --> 34:17.920
or at MaximumFun.org.

34:20.240 --> 34:22.240
Here's a Yahoo that I got from level9000.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.720
And maybe we don't want to do this one as anonymous user.

34:26.720 --> 34:30.080
I'm gonna call him Rod asks,

34:30.080 --> 34:31.920
on the podcast, my brother, my brother and me,

34:31.920 --> 34:33.600
how do you tell which one is talking?

34:33.600 --> 34:34.000
Oh.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.240
I've listened to many episodes and clips of my Bim Bam

34:36.240 --> 34:38.960
and watched the show and I can still never tell who is talking.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.200
If I'm actively trying, I can distinguish Griffin,

34:41.200 --> 34:43.920
but I have never once known if it is Justin or Travis.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.400
Please, I know fans mind this forum for content.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.800
Is there a hack or a guide or anything?

34:49.440 --> 34:52.640
Well, I think maybe one of the issues people run into is

34:52.640 --> 34:55.920
I also don't know which one of us is talking at any given time.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.280
And that's why I interrupt so much.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.040
Cause sometimes like Justin will be talking

34:59.040 --> 35:00.320
and I'll think that's me talking.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.200
It's just you.

35:01.200 --> 35:01.520
Yeah.

35:02.400 --> 35:02.720
And that's-

35:02.720 --> 35:03.600
I'm not going anywhere.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.560
I shouldn't interrupt myself.

35:04.560 --> 35:04.800
Yeah.

35:04.800 --> 35:05.600
What am I saying?

35:05.600 --> 35:06.480
This is garbage.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.440
This is a bad joke.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.840
Griffin, here's the first thing I'll say,

35:09.840 --> 35:11.920
it doesn't fucking matter who cares.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.240
It really, it really doesn't fucking matter.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.840
It doesn't matter which one of us is talking.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, this is a widespread problem.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
We're very, yeah, we get this all the time.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.080
Like we're very rarely giving in order instructions

35:24.080 --> 35:26.320
on how to like fix your kitchen sink or something

35:26.320 --> 35:28.560
that would necessitate proper order

35:28.560 --> 35:32.640
and you really being clued into who the advice is coming from.

35:32.640 --> 35:33.600
Just like, it doesn't fucking matter.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.800
I do get tweets that's just like,

35:34.800 --> 35:36.320
dude, your whole mango shit,

35:36.320 --> 35:38.240
that was a real funny run, dude.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.640
See, but at least that's on the same show

35:40.640 --> 35:42.240
because I get tweets a lot that are like,

35:42.240 --> 35:43.600
I love you on Sawbones.

35:44.160 --> 35:47.440
And that's not me.

35:47.440 --> 35:52.000
I also don't do Monster Factory or quality control.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.680
That's Justin.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.920
Damn, dude, what do you do?

35:55.920 --> 35:58.080
Someone once tweeted that they don't listen to Schmanners

35:58.080 --> 35:59.520
because they don't like me.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.200
And it's like, well, hold on a second.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.960
Don't listen.

36:02.960 --> 36:03.600
Give it a chance.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.560
I'm not on that shit.

36:04.560 --> 36:08.080
I don't know if we want to do this one.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.440
I would love to hear, no,

36:09.440 --> 36:11.440
I have to hear what people have answered.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.480
Oh, there's no answers.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.920
So that's bad for us.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.520
That's not good for our brand, I would say.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.520
Here's another Yahoo.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.960
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

36:18.960 --> 36:19.520
Thank you, Adrian.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.680
It's Yahoo Answers user Blue who asks,

36:22.640 --> 36:26.800
is there anything you're not allowed to write on a headstone?

36:27.840 --> 36:30.400
Can you say, and then there's four asterisks here,

36:30.400 --> 36:31.840
so I'm gonna assume it says piss

36:32.720 --> 36:34.400
or any other swears on a headstone.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.160
What about any sexual references?

36:36.160 --> 36:37.760
Is it all right if it's only implied?

36:37.760 --> 36:40.000
For example, oh, gross.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.480
For example, least exciting hole I've ever been in.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.240
I'd prefer a real answer because I'm genuinely curious,

36:52.240 --> 36:53.600
but if you have a funny reply,

36:53.600 --> 36:55.680
I'm not gonna rain on your parade, dude.

36:55.680 --> 37:06.160
What can you put on, what can you not put on a headstone?

37:06.160 --> 37:08.560
Cause I've never seen one where you're walking through

37:08.560 --> 37:09.920
and it's just like, you know,

37:10.640 --> 37:17.600
Billups, January 14th, 1930 to 2005.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.520
And then it's like, you know,

37:19.520 --> 37:22.240
Jermichael and then a couple of dates and then you walk

37:22.240 --> 37:24.560
and then there's one that's just like ass.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.920
And that's all it says.

37:25.920 --> 37:26.480
I'm dead.

37:27.200 --> 37:27.840
Oh, fuck.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.040
Can you put whatever name you want on there?

37:31.040 --> 37:33.840
Like, could I just put like Elvis Presley on mine?

37:33.840 --> 37:35.680
Oh, that's really fun.

37:35.680 --> 37:35.920
Right?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.280
And then people will be walking by like,

37:37.280 --> 37:39.440
oh, these are so, huh?

37:39.440 --> 37:42.720
Wait, there's no, there's no way, right?

37:42.720 --> 37:46.000
It could be like that, what's it called?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.680
Lentricular pattern where like,

37:47.680 --> 37:50.640
depending on what angle you're looking at the headstone,

37:50.640 --> 37:51.520
it says different stuff.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.720
So you look at it from the left and it says like, you know,

37:54.720 --> 37:56.480
Elvis Presley, but then from the right side,

37:56.480 --> 37:57.440
it's like, nah, I'm just kidding.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.160
It's Travis.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.120
Nah, just Travis.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.040
But major look.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.520
One thing you want to avoid is timeliness.

38:04.400 --> 38:08.560
Like you often will see headstones with big barcodes on them

38:08.560 --> 38:11.760
and they say like, scan this with your cue cat for free coupons.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.720
It's like, nobody has a cue cat anymore.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.280
And nobody even listening to this podcast knows-

38:17.280 --> 38:19.040
Knows what the fuck you're talking about.

38:19.040 --> 38:23.440
How much do I have to pay to make my headstone a poke stop?

38:23.440 --> 38:24.400
Is that still a thing?

38:27.280 --> 38:28.320
Remember me.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.160
I know how to make the kids remember me

38:30.160 --> 38:33.040
by handing out free potions and poke balls.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.720
When you come and pay your respects,

38:35.680 --> 38:38.080
there's a Lugia boss fight happening

38:38.080 --> 38:40.080
at Travis's final resting place.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.200
Come on teens, gather round.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.120
I dropped a lure at Travis.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.200
He died as he lived.

38:47.200 --> 38:51.360
Surrounded by teens staring at their phones.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.120
That's a good one.

38:55.120 --> 38:59.120
Can you do Calvin pissing on the adjacent headstone?

38:59.120 --> 39:00.800
Oh my god.

39:00.800 --> 39:01.440
It's so good.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.720
Like an eternal flame, but with water or piss.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.080
No, I'm not saying literally spray the headstone.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.040
Not like a fountain.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.520
No, erosion would be a factor at that point.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.120
We don't actually want to erode.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.320
That seems rude.

39:14.320 --> 39:18.320
But it would be less rude as if the cartoon boy Calvin

39:18.320 --> 39:23.200
was pissing on Billups tombstone immediately next door.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.200
And then the Billups family would come and say like,

39:26.560 --> 39:27.760
did you just fucking see this?

39:27.760 --> 39:30.480
Did you fucking see this shit?

39:30.480 --> 39:31.680
They can't do that, right?

39:31.680 --> 39:33.120
Well, there's no law in the books.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.520
So I've bought the plot of land, right?

39:37.520 --> 39:39.360
Maybe I go buy it today.

39:39.360 --> 39:46.960
Can I build a tiny house on it now with just a trap door

39:46.960 --> 39:50.480
in the living room when you start to feel real close?

39:50.480 --> 39:51.200
Yeah.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.800
And then I just drop out the bottom.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.320
And then my tiny house becomes my Ozymandias tombstone.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.680
Look upon my tiny house.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.920
Can I get a vending machine that is constantly restocked

40:05.920 --> 40:10.160
with Snickers bars, and whatchamacallits,

40:10.160 --> 40:14.880
and handicapped's hottest fries, and Takis,

40:14.880 --> 40:18.400
but also just little pamphlets just sort of describing

40:18.400 --> 40:19.920
my sort of adventure?

40:20.960 --> 40:24.160
Those would be a couple better, I'm assuming.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.160
No, they would be 35 cents.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.160
Same price as a bunch of mints, but I

40:28.160 --> 40:29.920
got to cut a profit some way.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.360
Got to restock this thing, don't I?

40:32.560 --> 40:35.520
I'm just saying you're walking through the graveyard.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.880
That's hungry work.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.840
And then you see one, and you don't get a lot out

40:39.840 --> 40:40.480
of the tombstones.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.200
You pretend to.

40:41.200 --> 40:46.000
It's just like, oh, Frederick, long life, probably

40:46.000 --> 40:47.360
in a couple of the big wars.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.600
What a great life.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.120
But really, you're just thinking like,

40:51.120 --> 40:53.600
I wish this tombstone was full of whatchamacallits

40:53.600 --> 40:55.280
and Snickers bars.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.720
I'm here to satisfy.

40:58.320 --> 40:58.880
Forever.

40:58.880 --> 40:59.520
Forever.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.680
That would be a good thing to put on your tombstone.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.800
I'm here to satisfy.

41:02.800 --> 41:07.040
Or maybe it just has treasure with an arrow pointing down.

41:07.760 --> 41:08.960
And a question mark.

41:08.960 --> 41:12.000
So that way it's like, are you sure?

41:12.000 --> 41:12.640
Is it worth it?

41:13.520 --> 41:14.960
Maybe come back when it's dark.

41:14.960 --> 41:15.600
Dig me up.

41:16.160 --> 41:16.960
Get me out of here.

41:17.520 --> 41:18.960
Here is another question.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.520
I went to surprise my friend by going to their house

41:21.520 --> 41:22.640
since I haven't seen them in a while.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.280
But instead of them, I scared their mother half to death

41:25.280 --> 41:27.200
and learned they were out in a movie.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.160
Now I've been sitting in their bedroom for four hours

41:30.160 --> 41:33.040
waiting for them and I think their family thinks I've left.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.280
I'm afraid to suddenly walk downstairs to take my leave

41:35.280 --> 41:37.120
and scare them again as well as make them think

41:37.120 --> 41:38.560
I was just snooping slash loitering

41:38.560 --> 41:39.760
in their child's bedroom.

41:39.760 --> 41:40.640
How do I leave?

41:41.920 --> 41:43.840
Should I suck it up and go downstairs?

41:43.840 --> 41:45.600
Wait till everyone is asleep to leave?

41:45.600 --> 41:47.200
Stay the night and leave when everyone has gone

41:47.200 --> 41:47.920
in the morning?

41:47.920 --> 41:48.240
Help.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.880
That's from Confined in Cleveland.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.000
What have you done?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.600
What have you done to me?

41:53.600 --> 41:54.480
What have you done to me?

41:55.200 --> 41:56.240
Griffin is there now.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.040
Now I'm there.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.880
I'm in the room too because you put me there

41:58.880 --> 42:01.760
by making me hear this and now I'm in the moment

42:01.760 --> 42:03.520
and I'm feeling everything you're feeling

42:03.520 --> 42:06.080
and it's a nightmare.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.440
How could you do this to Griffin?

42:08.400 --> 42:10.160
Why can't we ever get a question that's just like,

42:10.160 --> 42:11.360
why can't we just get a question that's just like,

42:11.360 --> 42:12.720
I went to a candy store and they were having

42:12.720 --> 42:15.120
an everything's free sale and then I'm there

42:15.120 --> 42:18.800
with my mind astral projecting into the listeners experience

42:18.800 --> 42:20.320
and I'm like, candy tape.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.160
Maybe we should just do one episode

42:22.160 --> 42:23.600
that's all people sending in like,

42:23.600 --> 42:26.720
I found myself in a social, like a social situation

42:26.720 --> 42:29.760
and I handled it and it wasn't a problem at all

42:29.760 --> 42:31.360
and you don't need to worry about it.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.440
And then I'm there and I'm role playing

42:33.440 --> 42:34.960
what it would be like to be able to handle

42:34.960 --> 42:37.840
literally any social situation expertly.

42:37.840 --> 42:41.840
I just, I'm confused about the timeline.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.160
Okay.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.720
You got there, the mother was like, ah.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.200
Yeah, were you trying to sneak into the house?

42:47.200 --> 42:48.640
It's div up, ah.

42:48.640 --> 42:53.440
And then you're like, hey, I was here to see Flinchin

42:53.440 --> 42:55.360
and they're like, I'm sorry, div up,

42:55.360 --> 42:58.720
Flinchin's at a film and then were you like,

43:00.400 --> 43:01.760
I'll wait in their bedroom.

43:02.720 --> 43:06.720
Like, I don't understand how you got to the point you're at.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.320
Did you sneak behind the mother

43:08.320 --> 43:09.920
while she was making a sandwich?

43:09.920 --> 43:12.960
Like, I don't understand how you got into this situation.

43:13.840 --> 43:17.920
Okay, because, I'm sorry, divim.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.600
Here's divim, was it?

43:19.600 --> 43:20.400
Here's the problem.

43:20.400 --> 43:21.120
It's divim.

43:21.120 --> 43:21.520
Divim.

43:23.280 --> 43:24.960
Divim and Flinchin.

43:24.960 --> 43:25.760
Divim.

43:25.760 --> 43:29.920
There was a moment where the mother in question

43:29.920 --> 43:32.160
probably awkwardly said something like,

43:32.160 --> 43:33.760
would you like to wait for them?

43:34.480 --> 43:39.120
And what you should have done is said, no.

43:39.120 --> 43:40.560
No, I do not.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.800
Because I have things I could be doing.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.240
No, just tell them I stopped by and tell Flinchin

43:48.240 --> 43:50.480
to give me a call when they're back.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.920
The other thing I need to know about this is,

43:53.920 --> 43:55.840
all right, did you go like down the block

43:55.840 --> 43:57.440
or is this like a grand gesture,

43:57.440 --> 43:59.360
three-hour road trip kind of thing?

43:59.360 --> 44:00.240
Oh, good question.

44:00.240 --> 44:01.920
That is very confusing to me.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.280
I gotta understand what you would say

44:03.280 --> 44:05.200
unless you didn't have anywhere else to go.

44:05.200 --> 44:09.120
Folks, don't surprise people with presents.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.320
Remember what we were just talking about

44:10.320 --> 44:11.520
with social situations?

44:12.160 --> 44:13.680
I don't think it's great.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.680
It's not great for me personally

44:15.680 --> 44:19.680
if anybody on planet Earth showed up out of the blue

44:19.680 --> 44:23.200
and was like, hey, I'm foisting this social situation on you.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.120
You have not in any way girded yourself

44:25.120 --> 44:28.480
or prepared remarks, but now it's happening now.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.440
I was trying to think-

44:29.440 --> 44:31.040
That's not a good zone.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.200
I was trying to think if like,

44:33.200 --> 44:35.600
at first I thought, well, Justin, hold on,

44:35.600 --> 44:38.560
because if like David Tennant or Oscar Isaac showed up

44:38.560 --> 44:40.800
and was like, hey, I'm gonna hang out with you today.

44:40.800 --> 44:45.040
But no, because I would be unusable as a human.

44:45.040 --> 44:45.760
Exactly.

44:45.760 --> 44:46.000
Yes.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.360
Right, you're not prepared.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.040
I wouldn't be prepared for it.

44:50.080 --> 44:51.440
Yeah, no, don't do this.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.520
If ifs and buts were candies and buts,

44:53.520 --> 44:55.440
then this situation would never have happened.

44:55.440 --> 44:56.880
But the problem is that it did,

44:56.880 --> 44:58.240
and they're there, and now what?

44:59.680 --> 45:00.240
Okay.

45:00.240 --> 45:00.960
And now what?

45:01.680 --> 45:04.560
Your only option is to put on Flinchin's clothes,

45:04.560 --> 45:06.480
come downstairs and convince the family

45:06.480 --> 45:07.440
that you are Flinchin.

45:07.440 --> 45:08.640
Talon and Mr. Flinch.

45:09.760 --> 45:12.000
Hey, mother, it was a delightful film.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.920
I really enjoyed it,

45:13.920 --> 45:17.680
but I've been in the loo for the past hour

45:17.680 --> 45:19.360
and now I'm going out for a stroll.

45:19.360 --> 45:20.080
No questions.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.000
No questions.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.280
I'm wearing this hockey mask for hockey.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.200
As you've almost certainly surmised,

45:31.760 --> 45:33.200
I'm playing hockey.

45:33.920 --> 45:34.400
Later.

45:34.960 --> 45:35.360
Mother.

45:36.080 --> 45:36.560
Bye.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.080
This is a new voice I cooked up, mother.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.600
I'm trying something with my personality, mother.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.400
Bye.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.520
I'm going to toss,

45:45.520 --> 45:48.640
I'm tossing on the iced skates with my great friend,

45:48.640 --> 45:50.720
Divim, and then you duck under the table

45:50.720 --> 45:53.040
and take the mask off and some of the clothes off

45:53.040 --> 45:56.240
and you pop back up like, that's right, Flinchim.

45:56.240 --> 45:59.680
We're going to go and show the penguins who's boss.

45:59.680 --> 46:00.400
That's right.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.880
We're playing the Pittsburgh Penguins in hockey.

46:05.520 --> 46:06.960
Maybe you could, okay.

46:08.000 --> 46:08.800
This is good.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.360
Crack open the bedroom door so nobody can see you

46:11.360 --> 46:14.800
and just shout downstairs, mother, it's Flinchim.

46:15.520 --> 46:17.280
I've been enjoying the company of Divim

46:17.280 --> 46:21.760
for quite some time and he is now to retire to his domicile.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.360
You'll see him in a moment.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.480
Don't be frightened.

46:24.480 --> 46:25.360
Be prepared.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.440
Be prepared for his presence.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.400
This is the worst imaginable situation, I think.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.560
It's hard for me to think of worse ones.

46:35.120 --> 46:39.280
Okay, Divim, somewhere around the end of hour one,

46:40.320 --> 46:43.280
you had to start to think a lot.

46:43.280 --> 46:47.600
You had to start to question it, right?

46:47.600 --> 46:49.680
How did you get the four hours?

46:50.560 --> 46:52.640
I don't understand how it went so long.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.840
Did you fall asleep?

46:55.280 --> 46:57.040
Flinchim's got one of those caspers.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.040
Soft, you sink right into it.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.760
Does have the right amount of bounce though,

47:01.760 --> 47:03.040
so maybe I shouldn't say that.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.840
Well, that's the right amount of sink and bounce.

47:05.840 --> 47:06.560
True.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.520
How about another Yahoo?

47:08.160 --> 47:08.640
Sure, yeah.

47:08.640 --> 47:13.600
Yeah, here's one who was sent in.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.320
It's a person and it was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.040
Thank you, Adrian.

47:17.040 --> 47:21.680
It's from Yahoo Answers user, oh man, Naruto asks,

47:22.320 --> 47:27.120
and the avatar for Naruto is Goku,

47:27.120 --> 47:29.200
so I'm wondering if I should actually read this one at all.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.800
But it's a good question,

47:30.800 --> 47:33.200
but clearly if somebody calls themselves Naruto

47:33.200 --> 47:34.960
and their avatar is Goku,

47:34.960 --> 47:39.040
it makes me assume some things about their personality

47:39.040 --> 47:41.280
and whether or not they actually want to know the answer.

47:41.280 --> 47:42.720
Now, which one is a Goku?

47:44.480 --> 47:49.440
Goku asks, how did the person who invented the clock

47:50.640 --> 47:51.840
know the time?

47:51.840 --> 47:52.560
Oh, shit.

47:54.080 --> 48:01.440
So, back to Ardometrius or whatever,

48:01.440 --> 48:04.880
he's probably some old fuck just like,

48:05.680 --> 48:07.280
all right, I did it.

48:07.280 --> 48:11.120
It's got 12 numbers, little gears going around,

48:11.760 --> 48:14.800
and then when a little number points at one of the 12 numbers,

48:14.800 --> 48:16.320
that lets you know what the hour is.

48:16.320 --> 48:20.160
The bigger sort of arm on this one

48:20.160 --> 48:22.000
will tell you how many minutes it is.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.720
And why didn't we just also include minutes

48:24.720 --> 48:25.920
from 1 to 60 on the clock?

48:25.920 --> 48:27.920
Well, we wanted it to be hard for Griffin to tell

48:27.920 --> 48:29.760
what the time is even when he's 30 years old,

48:29.760 --> 48:32.320
but so here it is, the clock,

48:32.320 --> 48:34.880
and somebody's like, ah, cool, so what time is it?

48:34.880 --> 48:38.400
And then the person was like, well, fuck.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.440
I do not know what the time is.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.320
Can I just make that up?

48:44.320 --> 48:48.400
Because it's feeling like I got that three o'clock feeling.

48:50.240 --> 48:50.560
Shit.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.760
I've got the three o'clock blues.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.920
I think it's around then.

48:53.920 --> 48:56.400
Maybe they just started at like 12

48:56.400 --> 48:59.840
and that's where our whole shit started.

48:59.840 --> 49:02.000
Like, it's actually right now,

49:02.000 --> 49:05.200
whatever time it is when you listen to this, 3 p.m.,

49:05.200 --> 49:07.360
but your clock says whatever time

49:07.360 --> 49:10.800
because this old fuck just like started it at 12.

49:10.800 --> 49:12.400
Do you think he tried to work backwards?

49:12.400 --> 49:13.520
Like, well, let's see.

49:14.320 --> 49:16.160
I'm feeling pretty tired

49:16.160 --> 49:18.240
and I had a five-hour energy drink

49:18.800 --> 49:21.200
like five and a half hours ago

49:21.760 --> 49:25.440
and that was at, actually, there wasn't time then either.

49:25.440 --> 49:28.080
I actually don't know what to say.

49:28.080 --> 49:31.040
This old fuck, this fucking creep

49:31.760 --> 49:33.520
was probably just like, here's the clock.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.640
I just decided it's three o'clock, 12 hours in a day

49:36.640 --> 49:38.960
once it gets back to three o'clock again, it's a new day.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.840
And then they let it run and they were like, hey, bud,

49:42.880 --> 49:44.640
it's like totally different.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.640
It's three o'clock again, totally different outside.

49:46.640 --> 49:50.160
It's like real dark, I'm real sleepy, so what's the deal?

49:50.160 --> 49:52.560
And then this old piece of shit was just like,

49:52.560 --> 49:57.360
yeah, it's three, two, the sequel to three,

49:57.360 --> 49:59.200
you get two of them in each day.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.160
Okay, so you're just having fun with it at this point then.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.640
Yeah, it's the second three, you get two of them.

50:06.800 --> 50:09.600
Yeah, why did we start that back?

50:09.600 --> 50:12.160
Why not just a clock with 24 numbers on it?

50:12.160 --> 50:12.880
What the fuck?

50:12.880 --> 50:14.960
Why are we so cool

50:14.960 --> 50:17.600
that we only have room for 12 numbers on our clock?

50:17.600 --> 50:18.800
Grow up, old fuck.

50:18.800 --> 50:22.480
What the fuck? Yeah, put in 24 numbers.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.960
Like why wouldn't that be easier?

50:24.960 --> 50:27.120
This is, you're not talking about the,

50:27.120 --> 50:29.920
there are most countries do it like that,

50:29.920 --> 50:30.800
but I don't think that,

50:30.800 --> 50:33.600
I don't think their clocks have 24 numbers on it still.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.440
This is what I'm saying, it's like,

50:36.000 --> 50:39.200
why do I have to pay attention to whether it says AM or PM

50:39.200 --> 50:41.520
on my alarm clock slash coffee maker?

50:41.520 --> 50:45.360
Why can't it just be like military time across the board?

50:45.360 --> 50:48.880
It's 1.20 or it's 13.20.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.120
Because there's nothing sexy about like,

50:52.080 --> 50:54.560
my birthday is starting sharp at 17.

50:55.360 --> 50:56.240
Don't miss it.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.160
Why not? I think that's great.

50:58.160 --> 51:01.040
I'm gonna have dinner at 18, you guys be there.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.160
That's less confusing than wondering

51:04.160 --> 51:06.320
if my friend is having dinner at 6 a.m.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.520
What time does your show start?

51:09.520 --> 51:10.020
20.

51:12.720 --> 51:13.920
We are children.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.640
We are fools.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.480
Cause that is probably how they do it.

51:18.480 --> 51:21.200
Come on down to the comedy show, it's at 20 o'clock.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.240
How is that worse than just saying eight?

51:25.120 --> 51:26.960
I can't count above 12.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.040
Cause it sounds ridiculous.

51:29.040 --> 51:30.880
My show's at 20.30.

51:30.880 --> 51:33.280
It starts a little later than you would expect.

51:33.280 --> 51:34.960
Not 20, 20.30.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.520
How did they know what fucking time it was?

51:37.520 --> 51:38.640
It probably was noon.

51:38.640 --> 51:40.400
It probably, they had sundials and shit.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.320
And so when the sundial was like, there's no shadow,

51:42.320 --> 51:44.000
then they're like, okay, this is the middle one.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.120
This is noon.

51:45.120 --> 51:46.240
But the view just went off.

51:46.880 --> 51:48.240
So that, and that's an hour.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.440
It starts at 11.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.520
I know the view, I don't know what time is

51:51.520 --> 51:52.880
cause I just invented it.

51:52.880 --> 51:55.200
I know the view comes on at 11.

51:55.200 --> 51:58.160
So if the view just went off, it's gotta be close to noon.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.360
Let's all just decide.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.400
Let's all just go with noon.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.880
The end of the episode of The View, first one,

52:02.880 --> 52:05.920
like 800 BC, Meredith Vieira is like,

52:05.920 --> 52:08.720
all right, clock man, get ready.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.680
It's gonna be noon.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.120
We're gonna wrap it up.

52:11.120 --> 52:12.640
Three, two, one.

52:14.400 --> 52:15.600
Hi, this is your local news.

52:15.600 --> 52:16.880
We come on after The View.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.440
At noon, apparently.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.840
But top story today, it's noon.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.840
It's wild, dude.

52:23.840 --> 52:25.120
We did it.

52:25.120 --> 52:26.480
Breaking news, it's, oh wait,

52:26.480 --> 52:28.320
I'm getting an update from the booth.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.000
It's now noon-o-one.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.920
Wait, what, we don't say it like that?

52:31.920 --> 52:33.360
Okay, 12-o-one.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.240
Listen to me.

52:34.240 --> 52:36.160
Hey, Victoria, did you hear?

52:36.160 --> 52:37.360
12-o-one.

52:37.360 --> 52:42.160
That doesn't, now I get why the date line,

52:42.160 --> 52:45.840
the international date line starts at The View.

52:45.840 --> 52:46.720
I get it now.

52:46.720 --> 52:50.640
I was always confused as to why they kept that episode

52:50.640 --> 52:55.120
of The View in the archives in Greenwich.

52:55.120 --> 52:58.160
And now I know that that's where they keep

52:58.160 --> 52:59.440
that episode of The View saved.

52:59.440 --> 53:01.280
So if anyone's clock ever gets off,

53:01.280 --> 53:02.560
they can just set it to that episode.

53:02.560 --> 53:06.000
I mean, UTC, the Greenwich Mean Time,

53:06.000 --> 53:09.920
is it starts right at Whoopi's house.

53:11.520 --> 53:14.080
Which is very convenient for Whoopi.

53:14.080 --> 53:16.880
If Whoopi's late to work and The View gets started late,

53:16.880 --> 53:18.880
all time, it's fucked.

53:18.880 --> 53:21.440
The world spins off its axis, yes.

53:21.440 --> 53:24.320
And it's a lot of responsibility, but I trust her.

53:24.320 --> 53:27.840
Hey, Whoopi, stay, please, I made omelets.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.840
Please just stay for breakfast this one morning.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.720
It won't be the end of the world.

53:31.720 --> 53:32.560
It might be.

53:32.560 --> 53:33.680
It might actually be.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.520
It might actually be that.

53:34.520 --> 53:37.200
That explains why that one time when Whoopi was late

53:37.200 --> 53:39.000
and it still started on time,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.400
all of our cartoon friends had to go find her

53:41.400 --> 53:44.120
and bring her back to fight that giant owl.

53:44.120 --> 53:44.960
That's right.

53:44.960 --> 53:47.400
That's exactly how I remember it as well, Travis.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.920
Let's, listen, thank you so much

53:51.920 --> 53:53.440
for listening to this episode.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.240
A lot of the things we said weren't true.

53:56.240 --> 53:58.840
So we'll leave those to you to sort of sort through.

53:58.840 --> 54:01.080
Can you spot them gum shoes?

54:01.080 --> 54:02.160
This is true.

54:02.160 --> 54:05.480
We're doing some shows in the next few months.

54:05.480 --> 54:07.120
And we would love it if you would come

54:07.120 --> 54:08.480
and join us for those.

54:08.480 --> 54:11.840
We're gonna be in Dallas, Houston, St. Louis, Detroit,

54:11.840 --> 54:14.840
Columbus, Phoenix, Orlando, and Atlanta.

54:14.840 --> 54:16.840
And we would love it if you would come join us.

54:16.840 --> 54:20.040
If you go to mackerelshows.com forward slash tours.

54:20.040 --> 54:20.880
Is that right, Travis?

54:20.880 --> 54:21.720
Tours, plural?

54:21.720 --> 54:24.640
Tours. Tours, plural.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.680
Then you can go buy tickets to those.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.680
The Dallas and Houston shows are coming up real soon.

54:31.680 --> 54:33.880
So please go buy tickets for those right now

54:33.880 --> 54:36.080
and ensure your quality seating.

54:36.080 --> 54:38.840
All those shows, no matter what anybody tells you

54:38.840 --> 54:41.280
from now to the end of linear time,

54:41.280 --> 54:44.880
will start at 7pm no matter what.

54:44.880 --> 54:46.880
I also would say some of the shows are sold out.

54:46.880 --> 54:48.920
And I've seen people tweeting about like,

54:48.920 --> 54:51.720
apparently scalpers buy tickets

54:51.720 --> 54:53.400
and then charge an arm and a leg.

54:53.400 --> 54:56.600
There is literally nothing we can do about that.

54:56.600 --> 54:57.640
I wish we could fix it.

54:57.640 --> 54:59.560
That's why we do the pre-sales and stuff

54:59.560 --> 55:00.680
to try to combat that.

55:00.680 --> 55:03.360
And we just, unfortunately there's nothing we can do.

55:03.360 --> 55:04.360
But there's something you can do,

55:04.360 --> 55:06.640
which is buy all the tickets now

55:06.640 --> 55:09.240
so scalpers can't get their grubby hands on them.

55:09.240 --> 55:10.960
And then sell them for a profit.

55:10.960 --> 55:13.040
Then sell them for an arm and a leg.

55:13.040 --> 55:15.040
We want our listeners to profit from scalping.

55:15.040 --> 55:16.880
We have a new merch store also.

55:16.880 --> 55:19.720
If you go to mackleroymerch.com,

55:19.720 --> 55:21.320
you can find our new store.

55:21.320 --> 55:24.400
We partnered up with DFTBA on this one.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.000
Got a bunch and cool new items.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.320
There's a Munch Squad shirt.

55:27.320 --> 55:28.560
There's a Shrimp Heaven Now poster

55:28.560 --> 55:30.000
that is absolutely gorgeous.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.920
And a bunch of other stuff too

55:31.920 --> 55:34.360
that you can find over at mackleroymerch.com.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.040
So go check that out.

55:36.040 --> 55:37.440
If there's an item you don't see on there

55:37.440 --> 55:39.200
that you would love to have,

55:39.200 --> 55:41.600
email request at mackleroymerch.com

55:41.600 --> 55:44.480
and the people who make those sorts of decisions will see it.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.200
So please do that.

55:46.200 --> 55:51.200
I also wanna say I'm going to C2E2 in Chicago,

55:51.320 --> 55:52.720
the conference in Chicago coming up

55:52.720 --> 55:54.640
April 6th through the 8th.

55:56.040 --> 55:57.680
I've got a couple of events going on.

55:57.680 --> 56:02.680
So I'm gonna be doing a couple signings on Friday the 6th

56:03.240 --> 56:06.520

56:06.520 --> 56:07.800
And I'm doing a show,

56:16.480 --> 56:18.240

56:18.240 --> 56:20.960
but that's gonna be Friday night at 6.30.

Snakes everywhere, who asks.

What is the Dougie?

58:28.120 --> 58:31.080
And why does my mom want me to teach her how to?
