00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.440
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's another opening, another show.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.760
I'm Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

00:53.760 --> 00:58.720
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm living for this limelight, and I'm your middle-est brother.

00:58.720 --> 01:06.240
And I'm a Broadway baby, coming down to walk the streets,

01:07.040 --> 01:11.520
check out my baby feets, I'll be in the show.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.920
Anyway, I'm Griffin McElroy, I'm a Broadway baby, and it's time.

01:19.920 --> 01:27.840
Boys, the calling has harkened once again. The clarion calls calling us back up to the big stage,

01:27.840 --> 01:36.880
isn't it, boys? I tried to walk away, but that old phantom of the opera's pulling me back in.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.320
That fucking phantom's got the lasso. Sing to me.

01:41.360 --> 01:47.440
We've been watching this show, Encore, on the Disney Plus network. It's on TV.

01:47.440 --> 01:53.840
It's the one with Baby Yoda in it. Maybe you've seen this green guy. Everyone loves him.

01:53.840 --> 01:59.040
And in it, they make old people.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.480
There's just no way.

02:02.480 --> 02:08.480
There's no way to talk about it without using pejoratives, but they're not young folks,

02:08.480 --> 02:11.040
but they used to, and when they were-

02:11.040 --> 02:14.560
They used to be, thank you, Griffin, you were about to say that, but it's such a good point.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.920
Let's not gloss over that.

02:15.920 --> 02:22.480
When they were that, they did high school theater productions of Oklahoma, of Annie Get Your Gun,

02:22.480 --> 02:29.520
of whatever, and now Disney and Kristen Bell, Kristen Bell has a gun.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.480
Kristen Bell's complicit, 1,000%.

02:32.480 --> 02:39.440
She's holding the gun, and she says, hey, older folks, now you're gonna go do Annie again.

02:39.440 --> 02:46.960
And Annie from Annie is like, I'm 45. I can't sing, I can't, this guy can't be a character

02:46.960 --> 02:54.480
whose first name is Daddy because he's an adult, and he runs a Brazilian jujitsu dojo here in town,

02:54.480 --> 02:56.000
so he can't do that.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.440
Griffin has twice now mentioned that they are older folks, and the thing is, that's not us,

03:02.800 --> 03:04.400
that's not a judgment call on us.

03:04.400 --> 03:11.200
It is the whole point of the show that these are people who are at least two decades removed

03:11.200 --> 03:13.040
from high school doing high school production.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.360
And they used to be young, and they get a high school musical, not high school musical,

03:17.360 --> 03:18.480
but a musical in high school.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.880
No, musical high school has its own show over there.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.240
High school musical has high school musical, the musical musical high school,

03:24.240 --> 03:25.680
and that's a different thing on Disney+.

03:25.680 --> 03:33.200
This is encore where Kristen Bell at gunpoint forces adults to revive shows

03:33.920 --> 03:35.920
in like five days that they did as teens.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.160
Now, why do I say at gunpoint?

03:38.160 --> 03:40.560
That's not just me writing fan fiction.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.080
It is unfathomable to me.

03:44.640 --> 03:50.160
Un-fucking- I don't care if Princess Anna showed up in her Rolls-Royce and said,

03:50.160 --> 03:54.080
get in the car, we're doing Wizard of Oz again.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.440
I don't give a shit.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.560
No, no, absolutely not.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.360
For TV?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.680
Are you fucking with me?

04:01.680 --> 04:03.040
Not for a prize.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.960
This isn't a competition.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.880
You don't win fuck all.

04:06.880 --> 04:12.640
This is a show, and I say this, no, I don't say it with love.

04:12.640 --> 04:17.280
This is a show that trades on burned out stars.

04:17.280 --> 04:21.760
It trades on adult sadness because the point of the show is,

04:21.760 --> 04:24.880
wouldn't it be great to relive your glory days

04:25.440 --> 04:29.200
of Annie get your gun from high school?

04:29.200 --> 04:31.520
And people are like, yes, please.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.560
I will leave my job for a week.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.680
I will ignore my children

04:37.680 --> 04:41.920
so that I can remount my high school production

04:42.560 --> 04:45.600
of your good man, Charlie Brown or whatever.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.400
Unfathomable.

04:46.400 --> 04:51.360
There's a couple that broke up and the young woman in the couple,

04:51.360 --> 04:53.920
her name in high school was Amy, A-M-Y,

04:53.920 --> 04:59.440
and she dated this guy who said it would be kind of cute and funny

04:59.440 --> 05:04.880
if she changed the spelling to A-M-E-I-G-H.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.720
That is on her medical diploma

05:09.520 --> 05:12.000
because she's an OB-GYN who now goes by that name

05:12.000 --> 05:14.320
that that guy in high school gave her.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.000
P.S. not over it in any way, shape or form.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.320
They're back in the mix, back in the show.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.960
They're so deep in the stink again,

05:22.960 --> 05:25.200
and she tells the director this story

05:25.200 --> 05:26.960
and the director, sweet director,

05:26.960 --> 05:28.640
sweet Broadway director has to be like,

05:28.640 --> 05:32.640
oh, well, that's a, he must have really left an impact.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.440
Oh, no.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.800
This boy has Broadway sparkles in his eyes again.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.160
Gotta get on this show.

05:40.160 --> 05:44.160
I will gladly kneel before Kristen Bell

05:44.720 --> 05:49.760
and give my life up under her hands and I'll be-

05:49.760 --> 05:51.600
What show, Griffin, would you wanna-

05:52.400 --> 05:56.720
Well, I still remember all the fucking colors

05:56.720 --> 05:59.040
in Joseph's super jacket.

05:59.040 --> 05:59.680
Oh, really?

05:59.680 --> 06:00.640
Because I was in that show

06:00.640 --> 06:02.320
and I can't remember a goddamn one.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.520
I couldn't remember them then.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.360
Well, Travis, it's red and blue and yellow and green

06:09.920 --> 06:13.360
and blue and indigo and violet and-

06:13.360 --> 06:15.120
I think ochre was in there?

06:15.120 --> 06:16.560
And ochre and white.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.280
Ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.160
And white.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.640
And so much of it ochre.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.200
I, you know what?

06:23.200 --> 06:26.160
There's a big ochre patch right in the middle.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.760
Moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.920
Moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, oker.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.560
Speaking of okers, I think it would be fun

06:34.560 --> 06:37.640
if I was like, hey Kristen, I wanna do Shrek Again

06:37.640 --> 06:38.840
where I got to play Shrek.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.480
And she'd be like, is that true?

06:40.480 --> 06:43.040
Shrek Again is the movie about when Shrek dies

06:43.040 --> 06:45.440
and they send him back to Earth to be Shrek one more time.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.680
Yeah, I love that flick.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.200
You know what I dream out?

06:48.200 --> 06:51.000
I dream out the time my high school drama teacher

06:51.000 --> 06:54.800
made us do an episode of Friends for a drama project.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.480
Yeah, I'd like to see that, I think.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.760
I think I'd dream out that,

06:57.760 --> 07:00.680
or maybe the same teacher in the same class

07:00.680 --> 07:04.120
made us do an episode of Will and Grace as a drama project.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.680
That might be, that might be a good one.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.160
Are you doing a pre-sale on tickets, Travis?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.800
Cause I do not wanna miss this.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.280
Or I could do that time I did a monologue

07:14.280 --> 07:17.800
based on cut together parts from Fight Club.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.960
Oh, Trev, I need to be in the front row for,

07:19.960 --> 07:22.600
I need to be in the splash zone for that one, please.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.880
So go ahead and snag me a couple comps.

07:24.880 --> 07:25.840
You got it.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.240
Have you ever wondered what the rules of Fight Club are?

07:28.240 --> 07:30.080
Wonder no more.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.000
I would probably remount that time

07:33.000 --> 07:37.320
that I did a staged lip sync to Sweet Home Alabama

07:37.320 --> 07:39.480
while wearing a flannel shirt

07:39.480 --> 07:42.200
and with a little bendel over my shoulder

07:42.200 --> 07:46.680
with a cardboard sign that said Next Stop Alabama.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.200
And I think I would remount that powerful,

07:49.200 --> 07:51.440
Now I'm sorry, Justin, that was in college.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.800
You can't.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.200
Written and directed by Forrest Gump

07:55.200 --> 07:57.360
from the hit soundtrack, Forrest Gump.

07:58.320 --> 08:01.200
And I would love to remount that thing

08:01.200 --> 08:02.760
where I would pace back and forth on stage

08:02.760 --> 08:04.760
for three minutes with my fucking arm out.

08:04.760 --> 08:09.760
Just, I didn't, hey, and also was in high school,

08:10.400 --> 08:13.040
didn't understand literally anything I was saying.

08:13.040 --> 08:13.920
Neal who?

08:13.920 --> 08:14.840
No idea.

08:14.840 --> 08:15.960
What or what?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.260
Can't imagine, no clue.

08:18.260 --> 08:19.420
Very good, very good.

08:19.420 --> 08:20.880
Anyway, this is the last episode.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.120
We're all about to go Broadway babies,

08:23.120 --> 08:25.520
so let's send them out in style.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.160
That's great, I'm ready.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.000
Are you guys ready?

08:28.000 --> 08:28.920
I'm ready.

08:28.920 --> 08:33.200
I've become a great lover of craft breweries over the years

08:33.200 --> 08:34.440
and with this interest,

08:34.440 --> 08:36.920
I've collected some really neat drinkware

08:36.920 --> 08:39.360
to enjoy my fancy beers.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.040
I have even recently gotten a job at a shop

08:43.040 --> 08:46.200
that sells drinking horns, pewter tankards,

08:46.200 --> 08:47.700
and every manner of beer glass.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.960
My question is, how douchey is it

08:50.960 --> 08:53.760
if I bring my own cool drinkware

08:53.760 --> 08:58.120
to other people's houses for me to use?

08:58.120 --> 09:01.640
I feel silly drinking from a horned skull mug at home

09:01.640 --> 09:04.600
as if I'm putting on a show for myself.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.340
Would my host think that their glasses

09:06.340 --> 09:08.040
aren't good enough for me?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.800
I just want to use my fun cups.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.800
I am in my mid-20s and a female ailing in Austin.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.680
Interesting, okay.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.000
If you feel silly doing it at home,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.200
my rule of thumb for most stuff,

09:23.200 --> 09:25.420
if you feel like a real goober at home,

09:26.560 --> 09:28.960
that's not going to be reduced

09:28.960 --> 09:30.840
by doing it in front of other people

09:30.840 --> 09:31.920
because when you're in front of other people,

09:31.920 --> 09:34.920
it's like being alone with an audience.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.160
Yeah, I guess, Griffin,

09:36.160 --> 09:38.320
but that doesn't hold true of things like, say,

09:38.320 --> 09:39.860
I don't know, karaoke,

09:39.860 --> 09:42.400
which would be, I think, weird to do by yourself

09:42.400 --> 09:45.000
and totally acceptable to do with friends

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
or, say, a conversation or ping pong.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.820
There's lots of things that if you do by yourself,

09:52.820 --> 09:54.120
it's okay to feel silly.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.680
Opening Christmas presents.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.340
Listen, listen.

10:00.340 --> 10:03.840
This person is hovering in between.

10:03.840 --> 10:08.320
They're both aware and unaware at the exact same moment.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.240
It's a quantum impossibility.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.780
Listen to this bit.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.280
I feel silly drinking from a horned skull at home

10:15.280 --> 10:17.560
as if I'm putting on a show for myself.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
Okay, interesting.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.880
Let's stop for a second.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.560
Let's pick up stakes.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.800
Kristen Bell shows up.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.640
Get in the car.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.960
We're taking this show to your friend's house.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.840
See, if you do it for other people,

10:27.840 --> 10:31.560
then you're putting on a show for them.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.640
It is a show about this cool cup that you have.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.080
Yes, this is true, Justin,

10:37.080 --> 10:39.320
because this is, let's scale this back

10:39.320 --> 10:41.600
and instead of saying a horned mug,

10:41.600 --> 10:43.760
let's just say a fun coffee mug that you picked up,

10:43.760 --> 10:45.060
a novelty coffee mug.

10:45.060 --> 10:48.020
As soon as you start walking it around, say, an office,

10:48.020 --> 10:50.000
trying to get people to notice

10:50.000 --> 10:53.980
how interesting your mug is, now it's an issue, right?

10:53.980 --> 10:56.080
But if you just have a fun mug that makes you happy

10:56.080 --> 10:58.920
that you drink out of, that's fine, right?

10:58.920 --> 11:01.480
Let's, okay, we're gonna get lost

11:01.480 --> 11:04.020
if we go step by step

11:04.020 --> 11:06.840
through every imaginable drinking apparatus.

11:06.840 --> 11:11.080
I think we can all agree on bringing your own drinkware

11:11.080 --> 11:14.040
to someone else's house is pretty fucking wild.

11:14.040 --> 11:14.880
Yeah, you can't do that.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.720
It's wild.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.540
It doesn't matter what it is.

11:16.540 --> 11:18.640
Because that would not extend to anything.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.800
I brought my own chair.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.000
Like, no, you go to the person's house.

11:22.000 --> 11:22.840
I would appreciate that.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.400
Actually, that would be nice.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.320
Well, maybe if they ask you to bring a folding chair,

11:26.320 --> 11:27.440
like if it's an outdoor thing.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.760
But you come to the house, you use the thing.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.140
Here's what I would suggest.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.800
Have people over to your house

11:33.800 --> 11:37.680
where your fun drinkware is for a fun drinkware party

11:37.680 --> 11:39.280
and get used to the idea

11:39.280 --> 11:43.480
that this fun drinkware is practical, is usable,

11:43.480 --> 11:45.640
is something everyone can enjoy.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.480
Or-

11:46.480 --> 11:47.600
I think you're gonna be thrilled

11:47.600 --> 11:49.000
by the way that your relationship

11:49.000 --> 11:50.120
with this drinkware changes

11:50.120 --> 11:51.640
when you have to stand over the fucking sink

11:51.640 --> 11:52.880
for an hour washing all of it.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.880
Yeah, because none of it's dishwasher safe.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.640
This horn is fun.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.000
Fucking get my arm,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.560
get my little scrub daddy in there for 20 minutes,

12:01.560 --> 12:04.880
getting all the nooks and crannies of the cornucopia.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.920
You could also, when you're over at your friend's house,

12:06.920 --> 12:09.640
just keep dropping glasses, shattering them.

12:09.640 --> 12:13.280
And then you say, these glasses aren't horn shaped.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.880
The horn shape is designed-

12:16.880 --> 12:21.880
I thought you were gonna say these special glasses

12:22.120 --> 12:24.240
until you have no choice but to say,

12:24.240 --> 12:26.080
listen, I have cool drinkware at home.

12:26.080 --> 12:26.920
I'll be right back.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.600
That's what I thought you were gonna say too.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.580
I drop my glass sideways really hard

12:32.580 --> 12:34.640
into all your other glasses.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.000
So now it's time for the horns.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.320
Oh, you could just bring your own horn to the party,

12:40.320 --> 12:41.320
but don't use it,

12:41.320 --> 12:44.560
but tuck it in the back of their drinkware cabinet.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.320
And then the next time you go there for a party,

12:46.320 --> 12:47.920
say, oh, I'll just use this glass

12:47.920 --> 12:49.760
and pull it out from the back of their cabinet.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.240
And they'll say, I don't remember that being ours,

12:52.240 --> 12:54.640
but it is in our cabinet, so go for it.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.360
Yo, if somebody's over at my house

12:56.360 --> 12:58.440
and they pull out a drinking horn

12:58.440 --> 13:00.680
from a secret cupboard in my kitchen,

13:00.680 --> 13:02.400
I will swat it out of their hand

13:02.400 --> 13:05.360
because it's almost certainly some sort of demon's curse.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.200
Oh, that's true.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.240
And you cannot convince me otherwise.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.000
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

13:10.000 --> 13:10.840
Yahoo?

13:10.840 --> 13:11.660
Yeah, I got one here.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.880
It was sent in by the prospector Merritt Palmer.

13:14.880 --> 13:15.720
Thank you.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.880
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.600
I'm going to call them Puma.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.880
Where are my Pumas?

13:22.880 --> 13:23.740
Socks. Not thick.

13:23.740 --> 13:25.360
Not my shoes.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.720
Anyway, Puma asks,

13:27.720 --> 13:32.240
how to win every time, no matter what, on chess.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.040
I'm tired of getting checkmated.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.220
The game would be so much more fun for me

13:36.220 --> 13:39.580
if I was able to win no matter what move my opponent makes.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.480
The possibility of me getting checkmated

13:41.480 --> 13:42.960
makes the game super boring,

13:42.960 --> 13:44.820
but knowing how to win no matter what

13:44.820 --> 13:46.660
will make it fun for me.

13:47.540 --> 13:51.400
Well, I'm going to give away my big secrets here.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.760
Okay, okay, listen.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.520
I have never-

13:55.520 --> 13:56.360
Let me do your thing.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.640
Hold on, let me do the Travis Chess Corner theme song

13:59.640 --> 14:00.760
one second.

14:00.760 --> 14:04.560
One night with Travis and you'll be good at chess.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.760
He's got the moves and he'll show them to you.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.600
Thank you.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.200
He's a special chess master like Bobby Fischer.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.920
And if you watch out, then he'll fish you too.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.840
Cincinnati, Midwestern City.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.800
Oh, sorry, go ahead, Travis.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.760
So I've never lost at chess ever in my life.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.780
And do you know why?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.560
Because I don't worry about winning or losing.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.960
I worry about intimidation.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.240
Because if you intimidate the other person,

14:31.240 --> 14:35.220
you'll never lose even if they beat you, right?

14:35.220 --> 14:37.680
Because you might, the pieces on the board

14:37.680 --> 14:40.000
might tell one story,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.700
but the experience is going to tell another.

14:42.700 --> 14:46.460
They won't remember who took who's king,

14:46.460 --> 14:49.780
but they'll remember that you were pretty scary

14:49.780 --> 14:50.620
there at the table,

14:50.620 --> 14:53.520
and they're not going to want to mess with you again.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.480
That's how I win at chess.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.800
It's a mental game. You're talking, of course.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.920
Not of the ending,

15:00.920 --> 15:05.080
but of the victory of playing a beautiful game.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.800
Indeed, Justin, indeed.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.520
Indeed, a beautiful chess.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.960
When you move the knight and the other person says,

15:13.960 --> 15:16.560
ah yes, I had hoped you would.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.520
And no one cares whose knight they are.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.240
It is a dance at that point,

15:20.240 --> 15:22.260
black and white intermingling

15:22.260 --> 15:27.120
in what we in the chess industry call the beautiful game.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.080
Indeed, indeed.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.220
And maybe you knock the board over.

15:31.220 --> 15:34.040
You could also flip that shit.

15:34.040 --> 15:34.880
That's not-

15:34.880 --> 15:35.960
You flip the board and you yell,

15:35.960 --> 15:38.140
the game's over, I win.

15:38.140 --> 15:41.640
Maybe, while you stab a big pin in their leg.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.400
I've destroyed the beautiful game.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.860
It was too beautiful.

15:46.860 --> 15:49.160
And I also think I might've gotten you in the tendon.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.000
Are you okay?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.580
I got you in the tendon,

15:51.580 --> 15:54.220
but it was worth it to witness my destruction

15:54.220 --> 15:56.160
of the beautiful game.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.080
And then you eat, maybe not the king,

15:59.080 --> 16:00.200
cause that's too on the nose,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.360
but like a bishop, eat a bishop.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.800
It's all about, if you really wanna win every time,

16:05.800 --> 16:06.640
there's no-

16:06.640 --> 16:07.460
Every time.

16:07.460 --> 16:12.460
There's no rule baked in to the chess bylaws.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.080
On a tournament level, you're gonna have a hard time.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.680
If you go up against Magnus

16:19.680 --> 16:21.400
or whatever the hell that guy's name is,

16:21.400 --> 16:23.600
you're probably not gonna do good.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.240
But against any other Joe Schmoe off the street,

16:27.240 --> 16:29.840
if you're, you do it Monopoly style, baby.

16:29.840 --> 16:30.800
This is Laser King.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.760
This is Laser King.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.600
What's that?

16:32.600 --> 16:33.960
Oh, that's how we play it in my house.

16:33.960 --> 16:34.780
Laser King?

16:34.780 --> 16:35.620
Yes.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.620
And also, you're gonna have a hard time believing this,

16:36.620 --> 16:38.360
but there is no rule in the book

16:38.360 --> 16:40.960
that says that a dog can't play chess.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.280
So you could do that.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.120
Yes, yes.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.560
You could have him challenge your dog

16:44.560 --> 16:47.200
and then say, oh, well, it plays by dog rules.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.880
When you start losing,

16:48.880 --> 16:53.880
have your golden retriever, Peppa, run over

16:54.400 --> 16:57.520
and take their king with their mouth.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.560
And you say, oh, game, game, set, match.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.920
Because it doesn't say in the rules that,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.840
hey, respect my dog.

17:02.840 --> 17:03.680
Yep.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.560
Shoot a rubber band at their queen.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.400
Yes.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.800
And if you get her, that's it.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.620
That's it.

17:10.620 --> 17:12.880
Maybe seduce their queen.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.880
Oh, I like that.

17:13.880 --> 17:14.720
Yeah.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.560
Aw, dude.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.320
It doesn't always have to be violent, you know?

17:18.320 --> 17:21.400
Sometimes it can be the beautiful game of seduction.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.960
Down, you're down some points.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.560
Read your pawn from the Bible.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.240
It turns into a bishop.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.520
It evolves like a Pokemon.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.480
Yep.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.180
Get your pawn a horse.

17:34.180 --> 17:36.640
Boom, that's a knight, baby.

17:36.640 --> 17:40.360
Take another one, take a knight to the iron church

17:40.360 --> 17:42.280
or the gymnasium.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.340
Have them pump some iron.

17:43.340 --> 17:45.160
Now they're a fucking rook, baby.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.520
And maybe they get checkmate

17:47.520 --> 17:49.200
and they do you in, dirty.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.520
And they're like, you have lost the game.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.620
And you're like, uh-oh, look over there.

17:52.620 --> 17:57.600
And your queen and a bishop are boning down.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.300
And now that's the king.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.140
Right.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.840
Ooh, when they take your king, say,

18:01.840 --> 18:04.840
oh, joke's on you, this is a matriarchy.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.640
And then your queen zips in.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.480
Oh, that's good.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.600
And your king kills their king.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.720
They take out your queen.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.080
You reveal that one of your pawns is the queen.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.600
It's a Padme situation.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.440
Yes.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.260
Eat shit.

18:17.260 --> 18:20.440
Yes, they take your king and you have them arrested

18:20.440 --> 18:22.480
because killing kings is illegal.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.440
You can't kill kings.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.400
That's called assassination, my friends.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.560
And it will not be allowed.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.400
It's the year of our Lord 2019.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.400
You can't just kill a king and get away with it.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.520
You're going to the Hague.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.480
That is a good, this won't help you win necessarily.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.120
But when someone gets you in checkmate,

18:39.120 --> 18:41.280
what they're saying, this, you know,

18:41.280 --> 18:42.120
Shammat, right?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.680
It comes from the Persian, the king is helpless.

18:44.680 --> 18:48.640
So what they're saying is, that's it, I've trapped your king.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.840
I think you should be like, come on, motherfucker.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.560
If you think you're so fucking tough,

18:53.560 --> 18:56.840
let's do fucking, you say the king is helpless,

18:56.840 --> 18:57.680
let's fucking see.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.520
You don't know my king.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.960
You don't know what he's capable of.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.640
I've got the fucking Stallone.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.520
This is the first blood king.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.960
He's taken all your dudes.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.960
If you think the king is helpless, Shammat,

19:08.960 --> 19:11.280
come on, motherfucker, let's go.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.920
You should just take a finger,

19:13.920 --> 19:15.880
place it on top of your king,

19:15.880 --> 19:19.080
push him down real hard, real hard,

19:19.080 --> 19:21.560
until he burrows below the board.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.400
Yes.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.600
Oh, did you have him trapped?

19:23.600 --> 19:25.760
Or was there an escape tunnel?

19:25.760 --> 19:27.180
By the way, this isn't even the king,

19:27.180 --> 19:28.480
it's a pod-may situation.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.320
Nice.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.320
It's 2019, have him airlifted out.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.160
Oh, he's trapped.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.160
Okay, well he calls in his air force

19:34.160 --> 19:35.760
because he's a fucking king,

19:35.760 --> 19:39.360
and it's going to get him over here to safety.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.400
And now he's surrounded by a secret service.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.460
When I was in, I have another question.

19:45.460 --> 19:46.620
When I was in fifth grade,

19:46.620 --> 19:48.500
I fell out of the bleachers at morning assembly.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.700
Oh, man.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.180
I was afraid of people laughing at me.

19:51.180 --> 19:52.300
So when I got to the bottom,

19:52.300 --> 19:53.580
I pretended that I was dead.

19:53.580 --> 19:54.900
Oh, man.

19:54.900 --> 19:59.520
Jesus, this worked.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.460
The kids did not laugh at me.

20:01.460 --> 20:02.940
But then I had to go to the hospital

20:02.940 --> 20:04.020
and get many tests taken.

20:04.020 --> 20:05.420
Oh, my God.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.180
I never told my family the truth,

20:07.180 --> 20:08.220
and to this day,

20:08.220 --> 20:11.780
they believe that I have a serious fainting issue,

20:11.780 --> 20:14.500
and it is now and forever listed in my medical history.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.940
Oh, my God.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.860
How can I come clean and tell my family

20:17.860 --> 20:20.100
that I faked my own death to avoid embarrassment?

20:20.100 --> 20:21.340
That's Lauren from Kentucky.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.180
Oh, Lauren.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.880
This is a lot, Lauren.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.000
That's a lot, Lauren.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.660
That's a whole heck of a lot.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.340
My brothers might disagree with me, Lauren,

20:29.340 --> 20:30.620
but you're in too deep now.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.660
Why have you waited this long to come clean?

20:32.660 --> 20:34.180
You can't come clean now.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.340
You're in too deep.

20:35.340 --> 20:37.180
Why would you come clean now?

20:37.180 --> 20:38.300
Oh, because the guilt?

20:38.300 --> 20:40.380
You've lived for this long?

20:40.380 --> 20:42.100
You gotta just, Lauren.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.080
No, this is a very, very high stakes

20:45.080 --> 20:46.820
Boy Who Cried Wolf situation,

20:46.820 --> 20:49.840
where, you know, what if you beef it?

20:49.840 --> 20:52.420
And they're like, oh, that's just Lauren fainting again.

20:52.420 --> 20:55.140
Yeah, what if you have an actual fain?

20:55.140 --> 20:56.700
Then they're just gonna leave you there.

20:56.700 --> 20:57.540
What?

20:57.540 --> 20:58.700
Wait, hold on, boys.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.700
If they believe, if Lauren's family believes

21:00.700 --> 21:01.980
Lauren has a fainting condition,

21:01.980 --> 21:03.580
and then Lauren faints,

21:03.580 --> 21:04.420
you think they're gonna go,

21:04.420 --> 21:05.900
that's just Lauren being Lauren,

21:05.900 --> 21:09.020
and leave Lauren fainting on the ground?

21:09.020 --> 21:11.380
I guess, no, that's a, I mean, that's a fair point.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.540
I'll probably carry Lauren to safety.

21:14.580 --> 21:15.860
Oh, Lauren.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.580
Well, she just faints sometimes.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.180
Lauren, this is rough stuff.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.180
You gotta say something.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.140
You gotta get this one done.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.200
Lauren, don't listen to us.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.180
Do this thing.

21:28.180 --> 21:30.680
Stand up, and stand in your truth, and say,

21:30.680 --> 21:33.220
cause it'll, maybe for them it'll be a funny story.

21:33.220 --> 21:34.620
Unless they have had to, you know,

21:34.620 --> 21:36.640
unless they have catered to you

21:36.640 --> 21:39.500
in some sort of special way for your entire life,

21:39.500 --> 21:42.820
which I, you know, I hope is not the situation.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.540
They carry pillows around you all the time.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.680
Yeah, that would not be ideal.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.820
I think you gotta get out in front of,

21:48.820 --> 21:53.200
well, not in front of, on top of this one.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.740
You should stand up at the next family gathering,

21:55.740 --> 21:59.120
and say, hello, everyone, I have big news.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.440
I cured my fainting disorder by eating organically.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.280
Yes.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.540
Amazingly enough, by eating only organic foods,

22:07.540 --> 22:10.020
I cured my fainting issue,

22:10.020 --> 22:13.780
and I would like to do sort of a speaking tour about it.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.740
I guess that kind of gets even deeper in the line,

22:16.740 --> 22:17.580
doesn't it? Yeah, it does juice out.

22:17.580 --> 22:18.820
Just kind of just another layer,

22:18.820 --> 22:21.740
cause then you gotta eat organically all the time.

22:21.740 --> 22:22.940
It's even worse.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.940
Hey, Lauren, I just saw you eat at Twinkie.

22:24.940 --> 22:26.600
Are you gonna be okay?

22:26.600 --> 22:27.780
Travis, you wanna know something weird?

22:27.780 --> 22:30.780
When I was thinking of the next step of that joke,

22:30.780 --> 22:33.220
Twinkie was gonna be my food,

22:33.220 --> 22:37.020
as well, I guess that's the least organic, I guess.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.380
Yes, I would say so.

22:38.380 --> 22:40.220
I think the plastic that wraps the Twinkie

22:40.220 --> 22:42.100
is more organic than the Twinkie itself.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.980
But listen, if the makers of Twinkie are listening,

22:44.980 --> 22:46.660
I do love them.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.260
Yeah, huge fans over here.

22:48.260 --> 22:49.820
Know thyself, you know?

22:49.820 --> 22:52.480
Lauren, take their asses to Applebee's,

22:52.480 --> 22:56.300
and just say it, because it's rough stuff.

22:56.300 --> 23:01.100
I like, this is one of a subcategory of questions

23:01.100 --> 23:04.100
that I always enjoy, which is questions

23:04.100 --> 23:06.260
where the subtext is,

23:06.260 --> 23:10.160
PS, my family and anyone who knows me

23:10.160 --> 23:12.680
will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

23:12.680 --> 23:13.740
listen to your podcast.

23:13.740 --> 23:16.740
Cause there's no way, there's no way

23:16.740 --> 23:17.900
someone's listening to this,

23:17.900 --> 23:21.940
and they're like, a Lauren from Kentucky

23:21.940 --> 23:24.180
that fainted on the bleachers in fifth grade

23:24.180 --> 23:25.280
and almost died?

23:25.280 --> 23:28.620
There's no way that there is another one of those.

23:28.620 --> 23:30.600
So you're basically also saying,

23:30.600 --> 23:35.600
you've limited yourself as a point of origin

23:36.180 --> 23:37.300
for sharing this show.

23:37.300 --> 23:39.100
You'll never be able to share the show with your family.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.920
And that's really the bigger tragedy,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.100
if you think about it.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.660
How about another Yahoo?

23:44.660 --> 23:46.340
Yeah, I'd like that Trav, thanks.

23:46.340 --> 23:47.820
Oh, you're Griffin.

23:47.820 --> 23:48.660
Wow.

23:49.580 --> 23:51.340
Why'd it just happen?

23:51.340 --> 23:53.260
I just did the wrong one.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.080
I did the wrong one.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.940
You said the wrong dang one of us, didn't ya?

23:55.940 --> 23:58.540
Oh boy, I get, there's a lot of you guys.

23:58.540 --> 24:00.040
That's fair.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.700
Whenever someone is in Huntington

24:01.700 --> 24:05.920
that is not like a close friend of the family,

24:05.920 --> 24:09.220
I always know, because when they come to greet me,

24:09.220 --> 24:13.220
they're like, Mr. McElroy, it's like, oh fuck you.

24:13.220 --> 24:15.660
Say it, say my name, say my first name,

24:15.660 --> 24:19.420
say which one I am, say which one I am.

24:19.420 --> 24:20.600
Jareth.

24:23.340 --> 24:24.540
Michelle sent this one in, thanks.

24:24.540 --> 24:27.600
It's from Yahoo Answers user Jordan, who asks,

24:27.600 --> 24:31.060
is there a not weird way to wear a pocket watch

24:31.060 --> 24:33.140
with modern day casual clothes?

24:34.500 --> 24:36.860
I prefer to be always wearing a t-shirt

24:36.860 --> 24:40.580
and will never be seen in casual attire in public

24:40.580 --> 24:43.380
without a full zip hoodie, even in the summer,

24:43.380 --> 24:46.660
and I wanna wear this really cool pocket watch I have.

24:46.660 --> 24:48.220
Any ideas that don't look weird

24:48.220 --> 24:49.960
or make anyone conversing with me think,

24:49.960 --> 24:53.460
well, look at this weirdo, or something of that nature?

24:53.460 --> 24:54.900
Hang it off the zipper.

24:54.900 --> 24:55.740
That could be a look, right?

24:55.740 --> 24:59.180
Yeah, Justin. The zipper of the jacket?

24:59.180 --> 25:03.220
Yeah, yeah, if you attach it directly to your hoodie zipper,

25:03.220 --> 25:04.060
is that something?

25:04.060 --> 25:05.820
Well, yeah, and then when it's zipped all the way up,

25:05.820 --> 25:07.560
depending on the length of the chain,

25:07.560 --> 25:08.860
maybe it's just like-

25:08.860 --> 25:12.940
Replace the string that tightens the hood with the chain.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.660
That would be a look, right?

25:14.660 --> 25:16.220
That would mean something.

25:16.220 --> 25:17.460
It would be something.

25:17.460 --> 25:18.300
It would be something.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.580
The problem is, Justin, you would need

25:20.580 --> 25:25.580
either a second pocket watch or some sort of counterweight,

25:25.820 --> 25:28.900
some sort of ballast to keep the chain

25:28.900 --> 25:30.780
from being just ripped from the hoodie.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.820
So maybe, and maybe this is good,

25:32.820 --> 25:34.220
this is our all-day carry,

25:34.220 --> 25:35.580
and this, Justin's just opened up

25:35.580 --> 25:38.240
a lot of exciting cargo opportunities,

25:38.240 --> 25:40.460
some very exciting sort of Death Stranding play

25:40.460 --> 25:41.820
we can get into right here.

25:41.820 --> 25:43.460
On one side of my hoodie chain,

25:43.460 --> 25:45.020
I've got my pocket watch, of course,

25:45.020 --> 25:47.600
because I don't wanna be late for any of my appointments.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.840
Plus, you never know who you have to hypnotize.

25:49.840 --> 25:50.940
Exactly.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.620
Hanging from the other side perfectly

25:54.700 --> 25:58.080
weighs exactly as much as my pocket watch.

25:58.080 --> 26:02.660
I could have, you know, a gigapet.

26:02.660 --> 26:06.820
I could have, you know, a phone battery.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.620
I could have some lifesavers.

26:10.620 --> 26:11.600
A sandwich.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.140
Sandwich would be,

26:15.140 --> 26:17.660
I think it's gotta be fairly non-perishable.

26:17.660 --> 26:20.020
A big knife.

26:20.020 --> 26:22.140
A big knife, Travis, that's cool.

26:22.140 --> 26:23.660
Sheathed or unsheathed?

26:23.660 --> 26:24.500
Loose.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.820
That's a loose knife.

26:25.820 --> 26:27.660
A loose swing of knives.

26:27.660 --> 26:29.280
And when you walk in a room, you can say,

26:29.280 --> 26:30.620
it's cutting time.

26:30.620 --> 26:31.460
It's cutting time.

26:31.460 --> 26:33.340
Let me check my watch.

26:33.340 --> 26:34.660
Yeah, it's cutting time.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.620
That's good. It's cutting time.

26:36.620 --> 26:41.620
I love questions that have fun jump-offs for improvisation.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.700
Right now, is our bit just naming things

26:45.700 --> 26:47.900
that weigh about as much as a pocket watch?

26:47.900 --> 26:50.180
Cause I feel like we could be on this merry ground

26:50.180 --> 26:51.400
for quite some time.

26:52.780 --> 26:53.660
Just keep the pocket.

26:53.660 --> 26:55.720
Don't attach the chain to anything.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.580
Put it in your pocket, loose.

26:57.580 --> 26:59.620
And then if you need to look at the time,

26:59.620 --> 27:00.940
you grab the end of the chain

27:00.940 --> 27:03.180
and you slowly draw it out of your pocket.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.760
Then you hold it up in front of your face.

27:04.760 --> 27:05.800
You look at it.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.940
Then you put the whole thing back in your pocket.

27:07.940 --> 27:09.340
Make it a show.

27:09.340 --> 27:10.180
Make it a thing.

27:10.180 --> 27:12.820
Leave it loose in your pocket with your keys and wallet

27:12.820 --> 27:15.340
and just wait until you go through a metal detector.

27:15.340 --> 27:18.820
And have three other pocket watches in each pocket.

27:18.820 --> 27:20.100
You have anything else metal?

27:20.100 --> 27:22.220
I mean, are pocket watches metal?

27:22.220 --> 27:23.540
Oh, I got a few of those.

27:23.540 --> 27:24.380
Wait, is this one?

27:24.380 --> 27:25.660
What about this one?

27:25.660 --> 27:27.240
Is metal the hard stuff from trees?

27:27.240 --> 27:29.700
Or, I can't even remember.

27:29.700 --> 27:32.100
Is that the cave stuff or is it the tree stuff?

27:35.800 --> 27:37.100
Let's take a quick break.

27:37.100 --> 27:37.940
Okay.

27:37.940 --> 27:38.820
I'm sorry, do you have another joke

27:38.820 --> 27:40.700
about things that weigh as much as pocket watches?

27:40.700 --> 27:42.060
Another pocket watch.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.060
Oh, a compass.

27:43.060 --> 27:44.620
Okay, yeah, no, let's go money zone.

27:44.620 --> 27:45.740
The compass thing really landed.

27:45.740 --> 27:46.740
On the leath-o-meter.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.460
Our first sponsor this week is Squarespace.

28:00.460 --> 28:04.460
If you have a big idea, don't sit on it.

28:04.460 --> 28:05.820
Don't keep it in your heart.

28:05.820 --> 28:08.420
Get it out there into the world unless-

28:08.420 --> 28:09.260
Ow!

28:09.260 --> 28:10.980
Sorry, I sat on my big idea.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.460
Unless it could hurt other people.

28:13.460 --> 28:14.300
Oh, I see.

28:14.300 --> 28:17.020
Folks, please don't harness the incredible power

28:17.020 --> 28:20.340
of Squarespace with its ability to showcase your work,

28:20.340 --> 28:21.940
sell products and services of all kinds,

28:21.940 --> 28:24.060
or promote your physical or online business.

28:24.060 --> 28:27.660
Do not harness this to do wicked in the world.

28:27.660 --> 28:29.100
This is a plea from us.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.100
This technology's too powerful, folks.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.980
They got beautiful customizable templates

28:32.980 --> 28:34.260
created by world-class designers,

28:34.260 --> 28:35.900
analytics to help you grow in real time,

28:35.900 --> 28:37.800
and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

28:37.800 --> 28:42.560
And if you use that as a tool to destroy those around you,

28:42.560 --> 28:44.220
people are gonna get hurt, folks.

28:44.220 --> 28:45.420
This is serious.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.500
Stop goofing around with Squarespace in a reckless way.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.380
I beg of you, and the entire internet begs you.

28:51.380 --> 28:55.860
Please, check your heart, say your prayers,

28:55.860 --> 28:57.380
consult with your priest,

28:57.380 --> 28:59.840
and then go to squarespace.com slash my brother

29:15.420 --> 29:16.860
Squarespace.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.340
Fucking be careful.

29:18.340 --> 29:23.160
Squarespace is partnered with a third-party group

29:23.160 --> 29:25.780
called Shitbomb, and the other day I tweeted,

29:25.780 --> 29:28.100
who lives on the internet, on my PC,

29:28.100 --> 29:30.180
shit, bob, square, space,

29:30.180 --> 29:31.920
and I feel like it didn't get enough attention.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.780
So I just wanted to drop that in here in the episode.

29:34.780 --> 29:38.880
This has been another segment of Travis's goofs

29:38.880 --> 29:40.060
that didn't land on,

29:40.060 --> 29:43.080
Travis's Secondhand Goof Shelter.

29:43.080 --> 29:46.620
Hey, this is a gently used goof.

29:46.620 --> 29:50.500
For 25 cents a day, you can adopt one of Travis's

29:50.500 --> 29:51.880
failed Twitter goofs.

29:52.820 --> 29:54.820
Keep it out of the rain and storm

29:54.820 --> 29:56.620
of not being especially good.

29:58.340 --> 30:02.100
I figure if I brawl in the audience, I'll find the target.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.180
I wanna tell you about Quip.

30:03.180 --> 30:04.180
What you got in that mouth?

30:04.180 --> 30:06.780
Teeth, tongue, the tip of the lips.

30:06.780 --> 30:08.180
Nope, that's outside of the mouth,

30:08.180 --> 30:10.900
but Quip is gonna handle all the inside stuff.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.420
Seriously, what's on there?

30:12.420 --> 30:13.340
Look at your teeth.

30:13.340 --> 30:14.460
Now look at my teeth.

30:15.560 --> 30:16.580
See the difference?

30:16.580 --> 30:19.300
It's because I Quip, I Quip, baby.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.980
I have good brushing habits because of Quip,

30:21.980 --> 30:23.940
and if you have bad brushing habits, what?

30:23.940 --> 30:27.460
With your plaque, if you've got little bugs in there,

30:27.460 --> 30:31.980
little, if you've got dirt and sticks in your teeth,

30:31.980 --> 30:35.080
then Quip is gonna help you get good brushing habits

30:35.080 --> 30:38.000
in the new year, or probably, if you have dirt and bugs,

30:38.000 --> 30:39.720
probably start immediately.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.860
Anyway, it's a thoughtful and practical gift.

30:42.860 --> 30:44.180
It's an electric toothbrush.

30:44.180 --> 30:49.180
They got refillable floss and toothpaste with Quip now,

30:50.300 --> 30:52.340
and it helps you make your good habits real simple.

30:52.340 --> 30:55.660
It's got sonic vibrations and a timer with 30-second pulses

30:55.660 --> 30:58.500
to guide your routine, and they have this floss dispenser

30:58.500 --> 30:59.900
that has pre-marked strings,

30:59.900 --> 31:02.220
so you always use the exact right amount,

31:02.220 --> 31:05.020
and they'll deliver Brush Head's floss and toothpaste refills

31:05.020 --> 31:06.660
every three months for you.

31:06.660 --> 31:08.920
So there's over three million happy customers,

31:08.920 --> 31:12.740
so maybe get some holiday gifts with Quip.

31:12.740 --> 31:16.180
Just go to getquip.com slash my brother to save on gift sets

31:16.180 --> 31:18.020
and to get your first refill pack for free

31:18.020 --> 31:19.180

31:19.180 --> 31:20.580
That's your first refill free

31:20.580 --> 31:24.260
at getquip.com slash my brother,

31:24.260 --> 31:26.980
getquip.com slash my brother.

31:26.980 --> 31:29.180
Hey, if you like your podcast to be focused

31:29.180 --> 31:31.140
and well-researched and your podcast host

31:31.140 --> 31:33.100
to be uncharismatic, unhorny strangers

31:33.100 --> 31:34.660
who have no interest in horses,

31:34.660 --> 31:36.380
then this is not the podcast for you.

31:36.380 --> 31:37.540
Again, what's your deal?

31:37.540 --> 31:39.340
I'm Emily.

31:39.340 --> 31:40.180
I'm Lisa.

31:40.180 --> 31:41.700
Our show's called Baby Geniuses.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.820
And its hosts are horny adult idiots.

31:43.820 --> 31:46.780
We discover weird Wikipedia pages every episode.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.040
We discuss institutional misogyny.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.100
We ask each other the dumbest questions,

31:51.100 --> 31:53.020
and our listeners won't stop sending us pictures

31:53.020 --> 31:53.860
of their butts.

31:53.860 --> 31:56.660
We haven't asked them to stop, but they also aren't stopping.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.660
Join us on Baby Geniuses.

31:58.660 --> 32:00.880
Every other week on MaximumFun.org.

32:03.820 --> 32:05.340
Can I derail the show with a special segment?

32:05.340 --> 32:06.340
Yeah. Sure.

32:06.340 --> 32:07.540
I need complete silence.

32:09.060 --> 32:12.420
Come and sit with me now in the candlelight.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.520
Yeah, this Christmas we're gonna do right.

32:21.060 --> 32:23.420
Hang some lights on the tree.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.380
Yeah, that's a Christmas to me.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.620
Put your arm around the fire.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.620
Yeah, I don't want any more, no.

32:41.620 --> 32:45.620
Yeah, you're calling me a liar.

32:47.620 --> 32:50.620
But I'm gonna go out for a jog.

32:52.620 --> 32:55.620
That's a Christmas to me.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.620
You and me and her and a tree.

32:59.620 --> 33:02.620
Running about birds and the bees.

33:04.620 --> 33:06.620
That's a Christmas to me.

33:08.620 --> 33:12.620
So this is my new segment, That's a Christmas to Me.

33:12.620 --> 33:17.620
Thank you to Adam Sakiyama for that lovely orchestration.

33:18.620 --> 33:20.620
This is That's a Christmas to Me,

33:20.620 --> 33:23.620
a haunting segment that I'm looking forward

33:23.620 --> 33:24.620
to sharing with you guys.

33:24.620 --> 33:27.620
I can't wait to see you.

33:27.620 --> 33:30.620
I can't wait.

33:30.620 --> 33:33.620
I need something to fill me with the fricking spirit.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.620
Here's the way this game works.

33:35.620 --> 33:39.620
I'm going to read to you three hallmark Christmas movies,

33:39.620 --> 33:42.620
synopses, casts, titles.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.620
Two of them are real films.

33:45.620 --> 33:49.620
One of them comes from my mind's eye.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.620
Now for anyone, maybe this is your first time

33:51.620 --> 33:54.620
hearing the segment, Griffin and I have historically

33:54.620 --> 33:56.620
been very bad at this game.

33:56.620 --> 34:01.620
Or one could argue, I am very good.

34:01.620 --> 34:02.620
Okay.

34:02.620 --> 34:03.620
And by I, I mean.

34:03.620 --> 34:04.620
Sydney.

34:04.620 --> 34:05.620
My wife, Sydney.

34:05.620 --> 34:06.620
Yes.

34:06.620 --> 34:07.620
And also to a lesser extent, me.

34:07.620 --> 34:08.620
Here we go.

34:08.620 --> 34:10.620
A Charming Christmas.

34:10.620 --> 34:13.620
Tiffany, Lori Loughlin, has made a name for herself,

34:13.620 --> 34:15.620
crafting the most intricate and sought after holiday

34:15.620 --> 34:17.620
themed charms at the Carlsberg Bracelet Company.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.620
When Mr. Carlsberg decided to move on,

34:19.620 --> 34:21.620
Tiffany assumed she'll move into the top spot.

34:21.620 --> 34:23.620
That is until David, Gabriel Hogan,

34:23.620 --> 34:26.620
is brought on to modernize Carlsberg's operations

34:26.620 --> 34:28.620
by mass producing the charms that the company

34:28.620 --> 34:30.620
has been hand making for over a century.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.620
David is tasked with learning Tiffany's craft,

34:32.620 --> 34:34.620
which he realizes may be harder to replicate

34:34.620 --> 34:35.620
than he first thought.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.620
As the deadline for Christmas production looms

34:37.620 --> 34:39.620
and sparks fly, the pair realize there may be a way

34:39.620 --> 34:41.620
forward they never anticipated,

34:41.620 --> 34:43.620
both for the company and each other.

34:43.620 --> 34:44.620
God.

34:44.620 --> 34:45.620
Damn, that's good.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.620
It's called A Charming Christmas.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.620
That's very good.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.620
Hats off to Christmas.

34:50.620 --> 34:56.620
Mia, Haley Duff, the loyal and hardworking manager

34:56.620 --> 34:58.620
of her small town's Christmas hat shop,

34:58.620 --> 35:02.620
her small town's Christmas hat shop is blindsided

35:02.620 --> 35:05.620
when her boss of over 10 years asks her to train

35:05.620 --> 35:08.620
his son, Nick Antonio Cupo, for a vacant

35:08.620 --> 35:11.620
upper management position that Mia had been coveting.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.620
Though Nick is a handsome, successful New York

35:13.620 --> 35:15.620
business consultant, Mia finds training him frustrating

35:15.620 --> 35:19.620
until Nick takes an interest in Mia's son, Scotty.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.620
Shawn Michael Kyre, helping Scotty

35:22.620 --> 35:24.620
with a pumpkin carving contest.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.620
However, Mia's faith in Nick quickly diminishes.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.620
Wait, a pumpkin carving contest?

35:28.620 --> 35:30.620
A pumpkin carving contest?

35:30.620 --> 35:32.620
Quickly diminishes when Nick fails to show up

35:32.620 --> 35:33.620
at the contest.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.620
To protect her son from further disappointment,

35:35.620 --> 35:37.620
Mia tries to keep Nick out of her and Scotty's

35:37.620 --> 35:39.620
fragile life, and Nick must decide if staying

35:39.620 --> 35:41.620
in the small town of Wilsonville is worth giving

35:41.620 --> 35:43.620
up the big city perks he once had in New York.

35:43.620 --> 35:45.620
As Mia struggles to find a way to convince Scotty

35:45.620 --> 35:48.620
to return to physical therapy so he can walk again,

35:48.620 --> 35:50.620
she soon realizes that Nick may be the Christmas

35:50.620 --> 35:52.620
miracle she has been waiting for.

35:52.620 --> 35:54.620
That is called Hats Off to Christmas.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.620
Oh wow.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.620
That's for sure.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.620
Juice, I think the world of you and Sydney,

35:58.620 --> 36:01.620
that one's real because your two minds' eyes

36:01.620 --> 36:04.620
are not capable of generating something like that.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.620
I agree with, from the start, you say Haley Duff

36:07.620 --> 36:09.620
and immediately I'm like, that's not a Justin

36:09.620 --> 36:10.620
and Sydney poll.

36:10.620 --> 36:11.620
That's Earth.

36:11.620 --> 36:14.620
That's life did that to us.

36:14.620 --> 36:17.620
Best Christmas party ever.

36:17.620 --> 36:21.620
Jeannie Stanton, Tori DeVito, throws the best

36:21.620 --> 36:23.620
Christmas parties every year for her company,

36:23.620 --> 36:24.620
Petra's Parties.

36:24.620 --> 36:26.620
Things are a little different this year as Petra

36:26.620 --> 36:28.620
is retiring and looks to the next generation

36:28.620 --> 36:29.620
to take over.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.620
Jeannie thinks that she has her new job in the bag

36:32.620 --> 36:36.620
until Petra's charismatic nephew Nick, Steve Lund,

36:36.620 --> 36:38.620
shows up as seasonal help and his natural talent

36:38.620 --> 36:40.620
and confidence clashes with Jeannie's team,

36:40.620 --> 36:43.620
stern work ethic, and traditional values.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.620
The pair battle it out for the top job with

36:45.620 --> 36:46.620
unmistakable chemistry and symmetry,

36:46.620 --> 36:50.620
but when the new owners of the legendary Terrell's Toys

36:50.620 --> 36:52.620
put the bottom line before Christmas spirit,

36:52.620 --> 36:56.620
threatening to pull the plug on Terrell's Toys'

36:56.620 --> 36:58.620
annual Christmas party for the community,

36:58.620 --> 37:00.620
Jeannie and Nick are forced to work together

37:00.620 --> 37:02.620
to throw the greatest Christmas party ever.

37:02.620 --> 37:05.620
The first and third movies are the same movie.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.620
They're all three the same movie.

37:07.620 --> 37:10.620
They're all three about a talented woman

37:10.620 --> 37:14.620
being displaced by an unqualified man.

37:14.620 --> 37:15.620
Am I correct?

37:15.620 --> 37:18.620
And by all three, we mean literally every movie

37:18.620 --> 37:19.620
on the Hallmark service.

37:19.620 --> 37:22.620
Yes, well, yes.

37:22.620 --> 37:26.620
Well, there's time travel ones, too.

37:26.620 --> 37:27.620
Yeah, you're right.

37:27.620 --> 37:31.620
I have my answer.

37:31.620 --> 37:34.620
To remind you, the titles are A Charming Christmas,

37:34.620 --> 37:37.620
Hats Off to Christmas, and Best Christmas Party Ever.

37:37.620 --> 37:40.620
I will count to three, and then you two

37:40.620 --> 37:42.620
will both say the title of the fake film.

37:42.620 --> 37:44.620
One, two, three.

37:44.620 --> 37:46.620
A Charming Christmas.

37:46.620 --> 37:47.620
Oh, boy.

37:47.620 --> 37:52.620
Continuing his streak, Griffin McElroy, you have done it.

37:52.620 --> 37:54.620
A Charming Christmas is a fake film.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.620
King of Games.

37:56.620 --> 37:58.620
Fake film.

37:58.620 --> 38:00.620
Best Christmas Party Ever is real,

38:00.620 --> 38:03.620
and Hats Off to Christmas is incredibly real.

38:03.620 --> 38:06.620
Hey, Hats Off to Christmas, you can't have

38:06.620 --> 38:10.620
a pumpkin carving contest in the fucking shit.

38:10.620 --> 38:14.620
I almost cut it.

38:14.620 --> 38:16.620
This is, honest to God, I almost didn't include it

38:16.620 --> 38:18.620
in the synopsis because it's like, well, they'll fucking know.

38:18.620 --> 38:21.620
I mean, I know not to do that, but they didn't know

38:21.620 --> 38:22.620
not to do that.

38:22.620 --> 38:24.620
Also, you can't six sentences in be like,

38:24.620 --> 38:27.620
oh, by the way, the kid might never walk again,

38:27.620 --> 38:31.620
and this dude didn't show up for his pumpkin carving contest.

38:31.620 --> 38:32.620
Like, okay.

38:32.620 --> 38:34.620
Maybe the guy thought it was a joke.

38:34.620 --> 38:35.620
Well, certainly.

38:35.620 --> 38:36.620
No, it's December.

38:36.620 --> 38:37.620
I thought you were kidding.

38:37.620 --> 38:38.620
It's December.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.620
There's no way there's a pumpkin carving contest.

38:39.620 --> 38:40.620
You can't get pumpkin.

38:40.620 --> 38:41.620
Everything's snow now.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.620
What are you talking about?

38:42.620 --> 38:44.620
I literally couldn't buy a pumpkin now if I wanted to.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.620
If I wanted to, I could not buy a pumpkin.

38:46.620 --> 38:50.620
Did you get a bunch and save them for two months?

38:50.620 --> 38:52.620
No, they're all soft and gushy.

38:52.620 --> 38:53.620
The perfect time to carve them.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.620
They're really easy to carve.

38:55.620 --> 38:57.620
Thank you, Justin, for this gift, and thank you, Sydney.

38:57.620 --> 38:59.620
It's a kind gift.

38:59.620 --> 39:00.620
How about another question?

39:00.620 --> 39:01.620
Yes.

39:01.620 --> 39:02.620
Is that where we're leaning?

39:02.620 --> 39:03.620
Okay.

39:03.620 --> 39:05.620
I'm a college student with a drawing professor

39:05.620 --> 39:07.620
that's really, really into Crocs.

39:07.620 --> 39:09.620
He wears Crocs in the class and has an Instagram

39:09.620 --> 39:13.620
dedicated to showcasing different Crocs slash Croc-related memes.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.620
As a thank you present at the end of the semester,

39:15.620 --> 39:17.620
our class has contemplated purchasing him a pair of white Crocs,

39:17.620 --> 39:19.620
signing our names with a permanent marker,

39:19.620 --> 39:20.620
and presenting them as a gift.

39:20.620 --> 39:21.620
That's nice.

39:21.620 --> 39:25.620
However, none of us know what shoe size he wears.

39:25.620 --> 39:28.620
What's a non-creepy way to find someone shoe size

39:28.620 --> 39:34.620
without also obviously revealing you're about to buy them plastic shoes?

39:34.620 --> 39:37.620
That's from Covert Crocs in Kansas.

39:37.620 --> 39:41.620
We will get to the nugget of the question in a second,

39:41.620 --> 39:43.620
but if I may question asker,

39:43.620 --> 39:46.620
if you're going to be signing them,

39:46.620 --> 39:49.620
do you need to get them in the professor's shoe size?

39:49.620 --> 39:51.620
Do you think he's going to wear them?

39:51.620 --> 39:54.620
You have imagined a reality in which this guy's like,

39:54.620 --> 39:56.620
everybody check the kicks.

39:56.620 --> 39:59.620
Signed by all my studiantes.

39:59.620 --> 40:01.620
So sweet, beloved.

40:01.620 --> 40:03.620
Anyway, let's mosh.

40:03.620 --> 40:07.620
Anyways, time for some frolf.

40:07.620 --> 40:13.620
Anyways, I now pronounce you man and wife.

40:13.620 --> 40:17.620
Anyways, I'm going to miss my grandma very much.

40:17.620 --> 40:20.620
Ashes to ashes and all that, let's rock.

40:20.620 --> 40:21.620
Crocs life.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.620
Croc life.

40:22.620 --> 40:29.620
Could you, for an earlier holiday of some sort,

40:29.620 --> 40:34.620
get your professor a Brannock device and have just say like,

40:34.620 --> 40:35.620
yeah, use it.

40:35.620 --> 40:37.620
He puts his foot in it to measure it right then and there.

40:37.620 --> 40:40.620
And he's like, I'm going to use this, I guess.

40:40.620 --> 40:42.620
It's a bad plan.

40:42.620 --> 40:44.620
Did you look up what it's called?

40:44.620 --> 40:46.620
A Brannock device?

40:46.620 --> 40:47.620
You just knew that?

40:47.620 --> 40:49.620
Everybody knows that, Travis.

40:49.620 --> 40:50.620
What am I going to call it?

40:50.620 --> 40:52.620
A shoe measuring tool?

40:52.620 --> 40:53.620
Yeah.

40:53.620 --> 40:57.620
Travis, I'm very literate and I don't even have a keyboard.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.620
So how would I search the name of such a device, Travis?

41:00.620 --> 41:01.620
Oh, you're right.

41:01.620 --> 41:02.620
Wait a second.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.620
I don't, Trav.

41:04.620 --> 41:05.620
Have a keyboard.

41:05.620 --> 41:08.620
I just wait for the internet to show me stuff.

41:08.620 --> 41:10.620
You know me.

41:10.620 --> 41:11.620
The oracle.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.620
I don't even have a keyboard to type stuff in.

41:13.620 --> 41:16.620
One way would be to go to your professor and tell him you're

41:16.620 --> 41:20.620
conducting a study on the connection between size people's

41:20.620 --> 41:22.620
genitalia and shoe size.

41:22.620 --> 41:23.620
Interesting.

41:23.620 --> 41:25.620
And then you get both the answers for the study.

41:25.620 --> 41:28.620
And two pairs of crocs.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.620
You get kicked out of class, probably.

41:30.620 --> 41:32.620
I'm realizing now.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.620
It's kind of foolhardy.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.620
I don't think that would be appropriate.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.620
Mine's not appropriate.

41:37.620 --> 41:41.620
Well, you could just say, you don't need to measure their

41:41.620 --> 41:43.620
weenie, you know?

41:43.620 --> 41:44.620
You do.

41:44.620 --> 41:47.620
You have to at least say, you have to get an estimate.

41:47.620 --> 41:48.620
A guesstimate, maybe.

41:48.620 --> 41:51.620
You do have to get an estimate on genitalia size.

41:51.620 --> 41:53.620
You're going to need to get it in metric.

41:53.620 --> 41:55.620
Which, yes.

41:55.620 --> 41:59.620
Now, what about, you have to get it in shoe size.

41:59.620 --> 42:03.620
I'm just going to throw this out here, because if it was a foot,

42:03.620 --> 42:07.620
if your genitalia was a foot, what would its favorite ice cream

42:07.620 --> 42:08.620
flavor be?

42:08.620 --> 42:09.620
And it is.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.620
You could break into their house.

42:12.620 --> 42:15.620
Don't chirp at my foot, dick.

42:15.620 --> 42:20.620
I pressed my cricket button, but didn't turn the soundboard on.

42:20.620 --> 42:22.620
So I don't think that's on the recording.

42:22.620 --> 42:24.620
So I think it's just going to be Griffin shouting,

42:24.620 --> 42:27.620
don't chirp at my foot, dick.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.620
Anyways, break into his house.

42:29.620 --> 42:30.620
We'll get it in post.

42:30.620 --> 42:33.620
And check his other shoes.

42:33.620 --> 42:35.620
That works.

42:35.620 --> 42:36.620
Shoe wrestling.

42:36.620 --> 42:38.620
Shoe wrestling?

42:38.620 --> 42:40.620
Play a game of trade shoe.

42:40.620 --> 42:43.620
Play a game of tradie shoes, or battle shoes.

42:43.620 --> 42:44.620
Oh, yeah.

42:44.620 --> 42:48.620
This is where you take your shoes off and try to hit them

42:48.620 --> 42:50.620
and knock them out of the victory zone.

42:50.620 --> 42:53.620
Yeah, you could do flip shoe.

42:53.620 --> 42:55.620
Flip shoe's good.

42:55.620 --> 42:58.620
Stink guesser.

42:58.620 --> 43:01.620
I'm glad there's so many games with shoes in it.

43:01.620 --> 43:02.620
Oh, make it.

43:02.620 --> 43:03.620
Oh, OK.

43:03.620 --> 43:05.620
I think this is actually a thing.

43:05.620 --> 43:08.620
But like a team building exercise where everyone piles

43:08.620 --> 43:10.620
one of their shoes in the middle of the floor,

43:10.620 --> 43:14.620
and then you try to figure out whose shoe matches who, right?

43:14.620 --> 43:15.620
That could be a good thing.

43:15.620 --> 43:17.620
That's a bad team building exercise, Travis.

43:17.620 --> 43:19.620
Well, it's more of a getting to know you thing of how well

43:19.620 --> 43:21.620
do you know each other's shoes.

43:21.620 --> 43:24.620
But would they not be wearing the matching shoe

43:24.620 --> 43:25.620
on their other foot?

43:25.620 --> 43:27.620
Justin, any ideas?

43:27.620 --> 43:29.620
I already did mine.

43:29.620 --> 43:32.620
It was good, and it worked already.

43:32.620 --> 43:34.620
So the person already knows the shoe size.

43:34.620 --> 43:35.620
Oh, OK.

43:35.620 --> 43:36.620
Yeah, the genitalia survey.

43:36.620 --> 43:37.620
They went with that one, weirdly.

43:37.620 --> 43:38.620
You know what?

43:38.620 --> 43:41.620
You can't go wrong with a good nine and a half.

43:41.620 --> 43:44.620
It falls pretty close to the middle,

43:44.620 --> 43:48.620
and a good nine and a half is going to do it.

43:48.620 --> 43:52.620
The only way that a nine and a half would not be the right

43:52.620 --> 43:56.620
shoe size is if they wear a 10 or larger,

43:56.620 --> 43:58.620
or a nine or smaller.

43:58.620 --> 44:01.620
Other than that, though, nine and a half is going to get them

44:01.620 --> 44:02.620
every single time.

44:02.620 --> 44:06.620
No, you don't understand, Justin, you stupid idiot.

44:06.620 --> 44:10.620
A nine and a half is so close to the middle of shoe size.

44:10.620 --> 44:11.620
Is it?

44:11.620 --> 44:12.620
OK, a 10.

44:12.620 --> 44:13.620
Thank you.

44:13.620 --> 44:14.620
A 10, a nice average 10.

44:14.620 --> 44:17.620
You put that on there, it's probably going to fit.

44:17.620 --> 44:19.620
It's close enough, don't you think?

44:19.620 --> 44:20.620
Here's what you do.

44:20.620 --> 44:23.620
When you hand them the box with the signed Crocs inside,

44:23.620 --> 44:26.620
the signed Crocs box, just make sure there's a gift receipt

44:26.620 --> 44:28.620
in there so they can exchange them.

44:28.620 --> 44:31.620
Yeah, I doubt the Crocs company is going to want any pair

44:31.620 --> 44:32.620
of Crocs back, though.

44:32.620 --> 44:33.620
I think every time Crocs sells-

44:33.620 --> 44:34.620
Especially if they're signed.

44:34.620 --> 44:36.620
Admittedly, that's going to be an issue.

44:36.620 --> 44:37.620
Yeah, that's not going to be great.

44:37.620 --> 44:38.620
I have a Yahoo.

44:38.620 --> 44:41.620
This one was sent in by Graham Robock.

44:41.620 --> 44:42.620
Thanks, Graham.

44:42.620 --> 44:45.620
It's from Mastermind587, who asks.

44:45.620 --> 44:46.620
Oh, I love their questions.

44:46.620 --> 44:50.620
Why isn't there restaurants anymore?

44:50.620 --> 44:53.620
Are like the old western saloon.

44:53.620 --> 44:54.620
Yes.

44:54.620 --> 44:57.620
You know restaurants that are made like the old western saloon?

44:57.620 --> 44:59.620
Well, not anymore.

44:59.620 --> 45:02.620
For example, the atmosphere is very stylistic.

45:02.620 --> 45:06.620
The restaurant has pictures, wallpaper, nice fancy clock,

45:06.620 --> 45:08.620
and they have really fine looking tables,

45:08.620 --> 45:11.620
and the piano is at the corner for the pianist.

45:11.620 --> 45:13.620
There's a nice carpet on the floor.

45:13.620 --> 45:15.620
I mean, with Chain Restaurant, even Olive Garden,

45:15.620 --> 45:17.620
you don't get this kind of stuff anymore.

45:17.620 --> 45:19.620
So that's what a saloon is.

45:19.620 --> 45:24.620
But, okay, I've watched many a cowboy movie.

45:24.620 --> 45:29.620
I've never once seen them walk into carpet, ever.

45:29.620 --> 45:32.620
Even the rest of it aside.

45:32.620 --> 45:35.620
Well, there's them some right pretty pictures

45:35.620 --> 45:37.620
you got hanging up on the wall,

45:37.620 --> 45:41.620
with your wallpaper and the nice fancy clock there, Jed.

45:41.620 --> 45:45.620
I like this table, I sure could kill a man upon it

45:45.620 --> 45:48.620
if he cheated me at cards.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.620
Where's your spittoon?

45:50.620 --> 45:51.620
Are you kidding?

45:51.620 --> 45:52.620
I have fucking carpet in here.

45:52.620 --> 45:54.620
Get the fuck out of here.

45:54.620 --> 45:55.620
You're right, that one's on me.

45:55.620 --> 45:57.620
Now dance, pow pow.

45:57.620 --> 45:59.620
Oh my god, I shot up your carpet.

45:59.620 --> 46:01.620
I feel terrible.

46:01.620 --> 46:04.620
I'm sorry, I'll get this replaced ASAP.

46:04.620 --> 46:05.620
Oh boy.

46:05.620 --> 46:08.620
I bet this was special order too, it's so nice.

46:08.620 --> 46:11.620
Let's ignore the fact that this person has no idea

46:11.620 --> 46:12.620
what saloons is.

46:12.620 --> 46:13.620
Okay.

46:13.620 --> 46:14.620
But why aren't there restaurants anymore

46:14.620 --> 46:16.620
are like the old western saloon,

46:16.620 --> 46:18.620
is a question that I would also like answered.

46:18.620 --> 46:19.620
We tamed the west.

46:19.620 --> 46:24.620
You know, you go into, I mean, here in Huntington, West Virginia,

46:24.620 --> 46:28.620
we got Logan's Roadhouse, Texas Roadhouse,

46:28.620 --> 46:30.620
that's carrying on the tradition.

46:30.620 --> 46:31.620
Yeah.

46:31.620 --> 46:33.620
Right, you can throw peanuts right on the dang floor.

46:33.620 --> 46:34.620
It's not the same.

46:34.620 --> 46:35.620
Not the same.

46:35.620 --> 46:38.620
But it's got like, for one thing,

46:38.620 --> 46:40.620
there's a lot of anachronisms, right?

46:40.620 --> 46:41.620
There's air conditioning,

46:41.620 --> 46:45.620
there's probably refrigerated food and ice.

46:45.620 --> 46:48.620
I like it in saloons in the movies and TV shows

46:48.620 --> 46:51.620
with cowboys in it, where they sit at the bar

46:51.620 --> 46:55.620
and they just sort of grab a bottle of warm brown stuff

46:55.620 --> 46:57.620
and give them a big cup of that.

46:57.620 --> 47:00.620
And I guess they just know what that is

47:00.620 --> 47:02.620
and like drinking it.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.620
Nobody orders in fingers anymore.

47:04.620 --> 47:06.620
Nobody says like, give me two fingers

47:06.620 --> 47:08.620
of your best sipping whiskey, right?

47:08.620 --> 47:09.620
That's pretty cool.

47:09.620 --> 47:10.620
That's pretty cool.

47:10.620 --> 47:11.620
We need to order like that again.

47:11.620 --> 47:12.620
You know what, maybe that's it.

47:12.620 --> 47:14.620
Maybe it has nothing to do with decor,

47:14.620 --> 47:16.620
but rather the atmosphere in general.

47:16.620 --> 47:18.620
I've never walked into a restaurant-

47:18.620 --> 47:20.620
The spirit of the west.

47:20.620 --> 47:21.620
Because here's the thing.

47:21.620 --> 47:23.620
First of all, I don't need a door that goes

47:23.620 --> 47:25.620
from the top of the doorframe to the bottom.

47:25.620 --> 47:27.620
Only the middle third, for some reason,

47:27.620 --> 47:29.620
and it needs to swing open in the middle.

47:29.620 --> 47:31.620
That's all we really need.

47:31.620 --> 47:33.620
Hey, stop.

47:33.620 --> 47:35.620
What is up with that door?

47:35.620 --> 47:36.620
Yes.

47:36.620 --> 47:39.620
Hey, that's almost like saying,

47:39.620 --> 47:42.620
I'm going to afford a real door someday.

47:42.620 --> 47:44.620
I know there should be a door here.

47:44.620 --> 47:47.620
I put a toy door in as a joke for my friends.

47:47.620 --> 47:49.620
Oh, I thought this door would be bigger

47:49.620 --> 47:50.620
when I ordered it.

47:50.620 --> 47:53.620
Guys are throwing each other through this dang thing

47:53.620 --> 47:54.620
all the time.

47:54.620 --> 47:56.620
I just wanted two little toy doors

47:56.620 --> 47:59.620
so I could save up enough for a good door, a real one.

47:59.620 --> 48:02.620
It basically says that when someone walks up to it,

48:02.620 --> 48:05.620
they just need to see their face and their crotch down.

48:05.620 --> 48:06.620
That's it.

48:06.620 --> 48:09.620
I don't need to know what's on their chest.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.620
But I've never walked into, for your example, Justin,

48:12.620 --> 48:16.620
at Logan's Roadhouse, and had the player piano stop

48:16.620 --> 48:18.620
and everybody turn and look at me.

48:18.620 --> 48:22.620
That should be customary, absolutely.

48:22.620 --> 48:27.620
Do y'all think, back in cowfolk's days,

48:27.620 --> 48:29.620
they would be sitting around in a saloon

48:29.620 --> 48:34.620
with the joke door, with the spit canister,

48:34.620 --> 48:39.620
with the warm brown stuff, with the fights and poker

48:39.620 --> 48:44.620
and probably smoke and probably stinky people in general.

48:44.620 --> 48:48.620
They were all probably sitting around like,

48:48.620 --> 48:51.620
gang, we can do better than this, right?

48:51.620 --> 48:52.620
Yeah, this sucks.

48:52.620 --> 48:55.620
Hey guys, I get it.

48:55.620 --> 48:58.620
It's the Wild West and things are rough

48:58.620 --> 49:02.620
and a lot of things haven't been invented yet,

49:02.620 --> 49:03.620
and that's too bad.

49:03.620 --> 49:05.620
I can't wait for that stuff to get invented,

49:05.620 --> 49:07.620
but I'll for sure be dead before that happens.

49:07.620 --> 49:11.620
So can we just be a little cleaner in here?

49:11.620 --> 49:16.620
Can we hold ourselves to a slightly nicer standard in here?

49:16.620 --> 49:18.620
I always think about that in cowboy movies,

49:18.620 --> 49:21.620
whenever a cowboy gets excited or is trying to calm everyone down

49:21.620 --> 49:23.620
and they shoot their gun up in the air,

49:23.620 --> 49:25.620
that you have to think the owner of the saloon is like,

49:25.620 --> 49:27.620
God damn it, it rains.

49:27.620 --> 49:30.620
Like you just shot a goddamn hole in my ceiling.

49:30.620 --> 49:32.620
Even if it didn't rain,

49:32.620 --> 49:36.620
we're all just trying to have a nice time

49:36.620 --> 49:38.620
and you've just discharged a firearm.

49:38.620 --> 49:40.620
Yeah, you shot the piano.

49:40.620 --> 49:44.620
Do you know how hard it is to get a piano in the Old West?

49:44.620 --> 49:46.620
It's hard, they're heavy.

49:46.620 --> 49:48.620
They don't have airplanes yet, guys.

49:48.620 --> 49:50.620
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

49:50.620 --> 49:52.620
We're not gonna have air conditioning in here,

49:52.620 --> 49:55.620
so just perish that dream away.

49:55.620 --> 49:57.620
But in lieu of that,

49:57.620 --> 50:00.620
can we not just piss on the floor, right?

50:00.620 --> 50:04.620
Yeah, and if any of you want to wear shorts, you can.

50:04.620 --> 50:06.620
Just shorts, guys, you don't need chaps.

50:06.620 --> 50:08.620
It's hot as frick out here, okay?

50:08.620 --> 50:11.620
Shorts and a t-shirt, that's fine.

50:11.620 --> 50:12.620
That's fine.

50:12.620 --> 50:14.620
If you guys want to dress more comfortably,

50:14.620 --> 50:16.620
and I'm looking at everybody,

50:16.620 --> 50:19.620
because some of the ladies in here got like 18 layers.

50:19.620 --> 50:21.620
Just shorts and a t-shirt, everybody.

50:21.620 --> 50:23.620
We'll all be happier and nicer.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.620
Same names.

50:25.620 --> 50:28.620
But scrub your nuts.

50:28.620 --> 50:31.620
It smells so bad, guys.

50:31.620 --> 50:33.620
It smells so bad.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.620
I'm in here, and I would love to have a Diet Coke.

50:35.620 --> 50:36.620
I can't.

50:36.620 --> 50:38.620
I'm going to have the warm brown stuff.

50:38.620 --> 50:41.620
That's apparently the only fluid they have back there.

50:41.620 --> 50:44.620
But when I drink this warm brown stuff I don't want,

50:44.620 --> 50:46.620
could I not smell your nuts?

50:46.620 --> 50:49.620
Can you just give them a scrub?

50:49.620 --> 50:52.620
Chaps are like the saloon doors of pants.

50:52.620 --> 50:55.620
It says, yeah, I know I should be wearing pants,

50:55.620 --> 50:59.620
but I'm going to leave my balls out here for everyone.

50:59.620 --> 51:02.620
By the way, it was to ventilate cigar smoke,

51:02.620 --> 51:05.620
and because the cowboys would carry saddlebags,

51:05.620 --> 51:07.620
and they'd have to go in and out,

51:07.620 --> 51:10.620
so the fact that the doors swung bidirectionally

51:10.620 --> 51:11.620
is very practical.

51:11.620 --> 51:14.620
That to me seems like an after the fact justification

51:14.620 --> 51:16.620
for dumb doors.

51:16.620 --> 51:18.620
For bad doors that they cut too short.

51:18.620 --> 51:19.620
No, it's perfect.

51:19.620 --> 51:21.620
This is a new style from Paris.

51:21.620 --> 51:24.620
I measured none and cut once.

51:24.620 --> 51:32.620
Hey, could you build me a new door?

51:32.620 --> 51:34.620
It's going to be like three weeks.

51:34.620 --> 51:35.620
Do we get more wood?

51:35.620 --> 51:36.620
We're in the desert.

51:36.620 --> 51:39.620
There's only eight trees in America.

51:39.620 --> 51:44.620
I could go to Home Depot in 120 years.

51:44.620 --> 51:48.620
I'm going to wait here for 120 years until Home Depot

51:48.620 --> 51:50.620
crops up here and I'll run right over.

51:50.620 --> 51:52.620
You always get the size of the coffins right.

51:52.620 --> 51:54.620
Well, I measure for those.

51:54.620 --> 51:57.620
Those are people's size.

51:57.620 --> 51:59.620
Easy.

51:59.620 --> 52:00.620
It's a size 10.

52:00.620 --> 52:03.620
It fits most corpses.

52:03.620 --> 52:05.620
Some of them we got to scrunch up a little bit.

52:05.620 --> 52:07.620
And some of them we got to put bricks in the bottom

52:07.620 --> 52:08.620
for them to stand on.

52:08.620 --> 52:09.620
It's fine.

52:09.620 --> 52:11.620
It's funny.

52:11.620 --> 52:12.620
Funny joke.

52:12.620 --> 52:14.620
And we take funny pictures with them,

52:14.620 --> 52:17.620
because it takes two hours to take a single picture,

52:17.620 --> 52:18.620
and we like it that way.

52:18.620 --> 52:21.620
Now spit in that bucket that's right next to where

52:21.620 --> 52:22.620
you eat your food.

52:22.620 --> 52:23.620
I'm not dipping chaw.

52:23.620 --> 52:25.620
Do I still have to spit in the bucket?

52:25.620 --> 52:26.620
You do.

52:26.620 --> 52:28.620
It's customary.

52:28.620 --> 52:32.620
But you can throw your peanut shells right on the floor.

52:32.620 --> 52:35.620
Then I'll vacuum the carpet later.

52:35.620 --> 52:38.620
Anyway, our sequel 101 Ways to Die in the West

52:38.620 --> 52:40.620
is coming out next fall.

52:40.620 --> 52:41.620
Hope you all come out and see it.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.620
These are just a sneak preview of some of the jokes

52:43.620 --> 52:44.620
that we're going to have.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.620
We just fully put Peter Griffin in this one.

52:46.620 --> 52:48.620
Like he's fully in it.

52:48.620 --> 52:53.620
If you got a little free time and maybe a few free coins,

52:53.620 --> 52:58.620
we want to let you know that our game, our board game,

52:58.620 --> 53:00.620
the Adventure Zone Bureau of Balance,

53:00.620 --> 53:03.620
is going to go on presale.

53:03.620 --> 53:04.620
When is it exactly?

53:04.620 --> 53:06.620
On the 11th.

53:06.620 --> 53:07.620
So in two days.

53:07.620 --> 53:09.620
On Wednesday the 11th.

53:09.620 --> 53:12.620
It's a cooperative storytelling card game

53:12.620 --> 53:14.620
that expands on the Bureau of Balance,

53:14.620 --> 53:17.620
the Adventure Zone Balance universe.

53:17.620 --> 53:18.620
You don't need a DM to play it.

53:18.620 --> 53:21.620
It's rules light and easy and fun to learn.

53:21.620 --> 53:24.620
We partnered with two other studios to do it.

53:24.620 --> 53:27.620
And if you go to theadventurezonegame.com,

53:27.620 --> 53:29.620
you can find out more information.

53:29.620 --> 53:31.620
That is also where the pre-order will be.

53:31.620 --> 53:33.620
Listen, we've played it.

53:33.620 --> 53:34.620
It's super fun.

53:34.620 --> 53:35.620
You're going to love it.

53:35.620 --> 53:36.620
Yes, it's good.

53:36.620 --> 53:38.620
Also, we've got the Candlelight Show coming up.

53:38.620 --> 53:42.620
If you haven't already, email us your questions.

53:42.620 --> 53:45.620
And that includes Yahoo's with Candlelight's

53:45.620 --> 53:47.620
in the subject line.

53:47.620 --> 53:49.620
We've got a bunch of new merch up in the merch shop.

53:49.620 --> 53:51.620
You can go to mcrorymerch.com.

53:51.620 --> 53:53.620
What else, boys?

53:53.620 --> 53:55.620
Well, I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

53:55.620 --> 53:56.620
for the use of our theme song.

53:56.620 --> 53:57.620
It's a departure off the album,

53:57.620 --> 53:59.620
Putting the Days to Bed.

53:59.620 --> 54:00.620
You're going to have a great time listening

54:00.620 --> 54:02.620
to this one with the kids.

54:02.620 --> 54:04.620
I also want to thank Maximum Fun

54:04.620 --> 54:05.620

54:18.620 --> 54:21.620
Oh, Justin and I are doing the besties again

54:21.620 --> 54:24.620
with our friends Russ Frushtick and Chris Plant.

54:24.620 --> 54:26.620
It's a video game podcast that we used to do

54:26.620 --> 54:27.620
a long time ago for Polygon.

54:27.620 --> 54:29.620
Now we're doing it with Spotify.

54:29.620 --> 54:32.620
And you can check it out, well, wherever.

54:32.620 --> 54:34.620
We put up a few episodes

54:34.620 --> 54:36.620
for whatever podcast platform that you use.

54:36.620 --> 54:39.620
But yeah, after that, it will be Spotify exclusive.

54:39.620 --> 54:41.620
So go check it out.

54:41.620 --> 54:42.620
And how about that final?

54:42.620 --> 54:44.620
Yes.

54:44.620 --> 54:45.620
Yes.

54:45.620 --> 54:46.620
This final Yahoo was sent in by Madeline.

54:46.620 --> 54:51.620
It's Yahoo Answers user NERBAL who asks,

54:51.620 --> 54:54.620
How do I tell my wife that I ate her fancy soaps

54:54.620 --> 54:56.620
that she bought for the bathroom?

54:56.620 --> 54:58.620
My name is Justin McElroy.

54:58.620 --> 54:59.620
I'm Travis McElroy.

54:59.620 --> 55:01.620
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:01.620 --> 55:03.620
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

55:03.620 --> 55:04.620
Kiss your dad.

55:04.620 --> 55:23.620
Square on the lips.

55:23.620 --> 55:25.620
Maximum fun dot org.

55:25.620 --> 55:26.620
Comedy and culture.

55:26.620 --> 55:27.620
Artist owned.

55:27.620 --> 55:30.620
Audience supported.

55:30.620 --> 55:32.620
I've got a message for you.

55:32.620 --> 55:35.620
Hi, it's me, April Wolf, the host of Switchblade Sisters

55:35.620 --> 55:37.620
and co-writer of the new horror film Black Christmas.

55:37.620 --> 55:39.620
And I'm Katie Walsh, film critic

55:39.620 --> 55:41.620
and occasional host of Switchblade Sisters.

55:41.620 --> 55:43.620
We're here to announce that for one episode,

55:43.620 --> 55:45.620
we will be doing something a little different.

55:45.620 --> 55:48.620
Much like Jeff Goldblum and David Cronenberg's The Fly,

55:48.620 --> 55:50.620
I will be going through a truly disturbing transformation.

55:50.620 --> 55:53.620
April will transform from the interviewer into the interviewee.

55:53.620 --> 55:56.620
I will be asking her all about her new film Black Christmas,

55:56.620 --> 55:59.620
her writing process and ongoing existential dread.

55:59.620 --> 56:03.620
But I will also be discussing John Carpenter's perfect masterpiece, Prince of Darkness.

56:03.620 --> 56:05.620
You guys seen any movies you like?

56:05.620 --> 56:08.620
So tune in to Switchblade Sisters for a one-of-a-kind episode

56:08.620 --> 56:10.620
with April Wolf and me, Katie Walsh.

56:10.620 --> 56:11.620
See you then.

56:11.620 --> 56:30.620
Only the corrupt are listened to now.
