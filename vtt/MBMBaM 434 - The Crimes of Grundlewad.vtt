00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.800
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, the advice show for the

00:46.800 --> 00:52.880
Bajanera. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.720
I'm your youngest brother, Griffin McElroy. I forgot what I say.

00:56.720 --> 00:57.760
Babiest.

00:57.760 --> 00:58.000
Yep.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.720
Yep. Folks, check your calendar. I'm sure it's probably beeping, and it's like, you're like,

01:04.720 --> 01:12.720
what did I set it for? And it's because it's time for a fantastic beast, the Crimes of Grindelwald

01:12.720 --> 01:14.400
Watch. That's right.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.840
It's Grindelwatch.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.320
Grindelwatch is here, folks.

01:18.320 --> 01:23.280
Can I tell you the weird thing, Justin? My calendar is beeping, but it's a paper wall calendar.

01:23.280 --> 01:30.800
Yep. It must have one of Grindelwald's wild enchantments on it.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.440
Yes, it must be a Grindelwald creation.

01:33.440 --> 01:40.640
I love it. Johnny Depp was like, I'll only play a character named Grindelwald because

01:40.640 --> 01:43.040
that's what I am, IRL fam.

01:43.760 --> 01:51.120
I like the series of Fantastic Beasts because it gives me the opportunity to feel what it

01:51.120 --> 01:55.680
must have been like to be a grownup when Harry Potter was extremely popular.

01:55.680 --> 01:55.920
Yes.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.760
They're all wizards and witches, and it's all nonsense to me?

01:59.760 --> 02:01.600
Wait, what's happening? What is this?

02:01.600 --> 02:03.920
They manage these guys? Grindelwald?

02:03.920 --> 02:09.920
They split the uprights of me, Griffin McElroy, who waited in line for a midnight release of

02:11.040 --> 02:18.480
not just one, more than one of the Harry Potter books, to now, in 2018, having disdain for

02:18.480 --> 02:26.480
Grumblegord and his curse. That was me, and now it's so not me, Grumblegig.

02:26.480 --> 02:32.480
I just don't care about the works of Grumblegig. What's he doing? And also,

02:33.520 --> 02:35.760
where's a little love for the mediocre beasts?

02:37.680 --> 02:44.800
All your favorites are not here. I misspoke. None of your favorites are here. Nobody knows

02:44.800 --> 02:50.000
the names of any of the characters. Nobody cares about this franchise, and yet it continues to

02:50.000 --> 02:54.480
tread all along. I'm sure making buckets of cash. I just don't know who's-

02:54.480 --> 02:58.720
Justin, now, I do want to say there are some Harry Potter series favorites in this one.

02:58.720 --> 03:04.080
I'm pretty sure that Lord Voldemort, and I know that's taboo, but I'm not afraid of him anymore

03:04.080 --> 03:08.880
because I saw Harry Potter kick his ass. He's in it, I think, somewhere. Looking forward to it.

03:09.760 --> 03:14.320
Got my tickets for release day, which I don't know what that is or what it is.

03:14.320 --> 03:19.440
I just want to know where are these- All these people are so worried about their beautiful

03:19.440 --> 03:23.680
beasts, and I just want to know what are you all doing to preserve the life of Lily and

03:23.680 --> 03:28.880
James Potter because we have a chance, folks. You have one opportunity.

03:28.880 --> 03:35.120
Oh, shit, and then JK Rowling could just follow her dream and do a completely reimagined Harry

03:35.120 --> 03:41.600
Potter series where she starts back at book one. Oh, and this time, Lily and James, totally alive.

03:41.600 --> 03:46.160
Totally part of it. They're there. Everything's cool.

03:46.160 --> 03:51.840
Not so close, fam. How is this flick two hours and 14 minutes long, fam?

03:52.640 --> 03:57.200
The boy- Hey, y'all, hey, y'all, gather close. The boy ain't in it.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.600
Yeah. The boy ain't in it in this one.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.040
That's actually how he's known in this one. The boy who doesn't appear.

04:03.040 --> 04:10.080
This is 134 minutes of boy-free material. The boy didn't saddle up for this ride, folks.

04:10.080 --> 04:16.560
It's just Eddie Redman opening up his suitcase and letting out, I don't know, a dog with,

04:17.120 --> 04:25.440
I don't know, a fish tail, or I don't know, a big bird. I haven't seen the first one either.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.520
I did. I watched that on a plane when I was three deep in the window, and y'all,

04:29.520 --> 04:34.000
there's no way they're going to top the Buckwild twist ending of that movie, which was

04:34.000 --> 04:40.880
this character has been disgraced shithead Johnny Depp the whole time. Surprise!

04:40.880 --> 04:46.240
He's had a charm cast on him to make him look like someone else, but it was the whole time disgraced

04:46.240 --> 04:52.080
piece of garbage shit Johnny Depp. Gotcha! Yeah, you did get us, I guess, Grimblewald.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.080
Grumblegust. He's just-

04:56.080 --> 04:57.120
Rumbleghost.

04:57.120 --> 05:04.080
Grumbleghost. Jonathan Depp called David Yates the director. He's like, hey, it's me, Johnny Depp.

05:04.720 --> 05:09.600
Bad news. What is it, Johnny? You're going to have to add some more minutes.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.160
Do you remember those beasts that you said were too fantastic? You're going to have to include

05:14.160 --> 05:23.040
them. Does Grimblewald eat the beasts? Is that his fantastic crimes, is that Eddie Redman opens up

05:23.040 --> 05:29.520
his magic briefcase and the fairy hippopotamus comes out and Grimblewald eats him? Is that

05:29.520 --> 05:33.680
the fantastic crime, just him slowly devouring every animal?

05:35.200 --> 05:39.680
I want to take my nanny to the movie theater and make this her first exposure to the Harry Potter

05:39.680 --> 05:40.800
series. So good.

05:40.800 --> 05:46.880
I want her to get on board with the HP franchise from the crime of Grimblegust.

05:46.880 --> 05:53.280
But start it here. This is her window in. This is where it starts. We're going to sit down

05:53.280 --> 06:00.640
for two full Christian hours and 14 Christian minutes and watch the crimes of Binglebust

06:02.960 --> 06:08.160
stroll across the screen doing magic hither and yon and get these beasts all riled up.

06:08.720 --> 06:14.560
If you timed it right, you could go while the sun was out and then get out in the cover of night

06:14.560 --> 06:18.960
and think that the end times have come. And then you can just say like, no, but then listen,

06:18.960 --> 06:22.800
there's two characters who are married that you haven't even met yet. They die,

06:22.800 --> 06:28.000
but their son doesn't. And he goes on a great school adventure for eight years.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.120
I'm sitting here looking at the rotten tomatoes on this one and I kid you not, it is sitting at

06:33.120 --> 06:42.560
50 percent Hollywood glitterati. Our critics of this great industry we call showbiz could not

06:42.560 --> 06:47.920
even be bothered to form an opinion. As one collective hive mind, they all shrugged and said,

06:47.920 --> 06:51.440
I don't know, the boy's not in it, but it is extremely long.

06:51.440 --> 06:57.680
This is like if you put out a Superman movie that was about when his dad was in high school,

06:57.680 --> 07:03.120
or even worse, like when his dad's math teacher was in high school. And you're like, wait,

07:03.120 --> 07:07.920
you call this- wait, why is- where's the Superman? Like, well, Superman's not even born yet.

07:07.920 --> 07:13.760
Why the fuck am I watching this movie? Well, the math teacher- well, his dad's math teacher wins

07:13.760 --> 07:19.520
the science fair. It's like if the Star Wars prequels are about Emperor Palpatine's childhood

07:19.520 --> 07:27.280
friend. I don't know how Rotten Tomatoes does their system, but the last review on here says,

07:28.480 --> 07:34.400
a strangely charmless and excessively dingy film, too long and static for anyone but the

07:34.400 --> 07:40.160
most diehard. With neither richness of tone nor color, this is a film guaranteed to sell tickets

07:40.160 --> 07:45.840
at the cost of its own soul. And that's a positive one, apparently. Rotten Tomatoes said, this is a

07:45.840 --> 07:50.800
thumbs up from this particular critic. This is a plump, juicy tomato you can definitely include in

07:50.800 --> 07:56.560
your puttanesca. Hey, let's do advice, huh? We've dunked on this dumb movie a lot. Okay,

07:56.560 --> 08:03.120
don't go see that movie. Don't go see the film. Don't go see Crime of Grimwall. But I don't have

08:03.120 --> 08:06.960
to tell you that because you didn't go see the first one, if you're me. Now that it finally

08:06.960 --> 08:12.160
feels like winter, my boyfriend has finally packed away his summer wardrobe. Turns out,

08:12.160 --> 08:16.240
he only has maybe three pairs of jeans and three sweaters. So over the course of a work week,

08:16.240 --> 08:21.440
he makes and matches different combinations to make five outfits that are all close but different

08:21.440 --> 08:26.720
enough that no one notices he's re-wearing a sweater or a pair of pants by Friday. Today,

08:26.720 --> 08:30.880
he wore the same sweaters yesterday with a different pair of pants. I told him people

08:30.880 --> 08:35.280
are gonna notice. And if anything, he should wear the same jeans with a different sweater

08:35.280 --> 08:39.200
because people are less likely to notice. He disagreed wholeheartedly and wore basically

08:39.200 --> 08:44.080
the same outfit as yesterday to work today. So what's the official ruling, brothers? How close

08:44.080 --> 08:48.640
can you wear things without people noticing and probably thinking you're a little weird and maybe

08:48.640 --> 08:55.600
gross? That's from Brisk in Boston. Is this like an SAT prep test? Here's the thing about this

08:55.600 --> 09:03.600
question that I think is missing. When you say no one noticed, what you mean is when your boyfriend

09:03.600 --> 09:09.280
walked into work, nobody pointed at him and said, that's the same sweaters yesterday.

09:10.560 --> 09:15.760
Just because no one did that doesn't mean they didn't notice. We're not in grade school anymore.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.480
You can't convince yourself that your shit is cloaked just because people didn't bring it to

09:20.480 --> 09:26.400
your immediate attention. Now, it depends on what the sweaters look like. If it's like a nice gray

09:26.400 --> 09:33.360
pullover and like a red cardigan and maybe just like a nice blue knit dealie, then maybe you could

09:33.360 --> 09:39.520
switch those out and people won't notice. But if one of the sweaters say like, I'm a real pizza

09:39.520 --> 09:44.320
puppy and it has a picture of a dog eating a big slice of pizza on it and giving a thumbs up on a

09:44.320 --> 09:49.040
skateboard, whenever that one comes up in the rotation, people are going to notice that it's

09:49.040 --> 09:53.840
pizza puppy shirt time again. Damn. Now, okay, see, hold on. Now I got to send an email to the

09:53.840 --> 09:58.560
FTBA to get this pizza puppy design into the store. We got to get this fast track.

09:58.560 --> 10:03.360
And make sure you include all of the false starts of like sort of the beginning articles of the

10:03.360 --> 10:09.520
pizza puppy that I sort of dropped and ate back up into my mouth. Maybe we're in like a Doug

10:09.520 --> 10:16.080
scenario where it's three of the same sweaters and three of the same jeans. Let's talk about jeans,

10:16.080 --> 10:20.560
because I think you can wear them shits many days in a row. And I think that you boys would be

10:20.560 --> 10:26.400
inclined, especially in the cold months. It's the cold months. Fuck off. Like, right? Like,

10:26.400 --> 10:30.720
I'm just trying to survive. I'm going to wear the same jeans a lot. It's not like I'm doing anything

10:30.720 --> 10:41.280
nasty to them. I put on a pair of raw shrink to fit Levi's on the day that we started filming

10:41.280 --> 10:50.560
My Brother, My Brother and Me, the television series, September 17th of 2016. And I have worn

10:50.560 --> 10:57.360
those jeans every day since. Not every day. Pretty much every day since. Wait, they've been your,

10:57.360 --> 11:03.520
hold on, wait. I do know what I said. I do recognize that I said this, but that seems

11:03.520 --> 11:10.240
excessive to me. That's what you do with denim. You live in denim. No, wait, hold on. Yeah. I've

11:10.240 --> 11:16.000
seen how you live, Justin, and you have two small children that help you live in those pants.

11:18.160 --> 11:22.320
I would argue they do not help you live in those pants. They hurt you live in those pants.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.240
They contribute to the living you do in those pants. And make the jeans strong.

11:27.120 --> 11:33.920
Okay, he's got one strong pair of jeans. The jeans get strong. Powerful jeans.

11:33.920 --> 11:40.640
Like Crusty maybe like builds up an exoskeleton. Crusty. If you lived in your jeans long enough,

11:41.200 --> 11:45.040
they, you get a- If you lived in these jeans.

11:45.040 --> 11:49.840
You live in these jeans. These are like the sisterhood of the traveling pants,

11:49.840 --> 11:52.960
except I'm the one doing the traveling, not the pants.

11:54.080 --> 11:59.360
I'm the whole sisterhood. The whole one man sisterhood in these beautiful pants. I just,

11:59.360 --> 12:04.400
if you get good denim and you wear it out, ask Jesse about this, if you get good denim.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.840
There are denim heads that'll pay $10,000 for some old jeans they dug out of a coal mine

12:09.840 --> 12:14.080
somebody died in. They'll like buy the jeans to get them and just wear them every day.

12:15.120 --> 12:19.200
And you're not supposed to wash them. You wash them, not at first,

12:19.200 --> 12:23.520
because you're going to lose a lot of the indigo. What you're trying to do is wear some lines into

12:23.520 --> 12:26.640
them. And then you wear, you will lose a little bit of the color, but you're also going to get

12:26.640 --> 12:29.920
some of those good wear lines. I'm saying jeans you wear every day.

12:29.920 --> 12:34.320
And stink lines, you fucking junkyard baby. What are you doing?

12:34.320 --> 12:39.440
Travis. Hey, Travis, go. I want you to right now have a Memento style flashback

12:39.440 --> 12:46.480
of all the times you've told me my jeans stink in the past 18 months. And when you come up a little

12:46.480 --> 12:51.360
bit short there, Christopher Nolan, you're going to realize that you don't have any b-roll to put

12:51.360 --> 12:56.480
into this montage because there ain't none. There ain't no times. He does got you there.

12:56.480 --> 13:02.000
What's the appropriate, to make this more relatable, because I feel like I thought

13:02.000 --> 13:06.720
my position was extreme and then Justin came shrieking into the room with his jeans that stand

13:06.720 --> 13:12.800
up on their own. So let's come up with a more relatable rule, which is what is the appropriate

13:12.800 --> 13:24.160
ratio of tops to long pants to have for every day wear to a workplace? Or school or whatever.

13:24.160 --> 13:27.840
I don't give a shit. I work from home. I'll wear me on these lounge pants every fucking day.

13:27.840 --> 13:35.200
I don't care. I have nothing. But for me, just going by my own closet, it's like six to one.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.840
Six shirts to one pair of long pants. Maybe even more favoring the shirts.

13:39.840 --> 13:46.080
Yeah, I would say somewhere between five to one. Especially when we're talking jeans,

13:46.880 --> 13:53.520
there's something about a khaki or linen that's like maybe two days. But jeans,

13:54.320 --> 13:58.880
I feel like you could do jeans for a week. But the thing is, we're not talking about

13:58.880 --> 14:04.160
wear. We're talking about you're going to work in front of other human beings.

14:04.160 --> 14:08.080
You need as many shirts as you have days of work.

14:08.080 --> 14:08.400
Yes.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.840
You need as many shirts as you could wear in a work week. And you probably,

14:12.720 --> 14:20.240
if you have just one extra, then you're mustard proof. But currently you live in a world,

14:20.240 --> 14:23.920
I don't want you to live in a world that can be upended by mustard.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.680
And that is the precarious situation you find yourself in.

14:28.240 --> 14:35.200
Right now you could lose 33.3% repeating of your wardrobe to a mustard incident.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.200
Yeah.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.800
There's no peace of mind there.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.880
The stakes are way too high. You could never eat a hot dog.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.920
When you're eating steaks, the stakes are too high.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.760
How about a Yahoo?

14:45.760 --> 14:46.160
Yes.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.760
This one was sent in by Merit Palmer. Thank you, Merit. It's Yahoo Answers user,

14:49.760 --> 14:51.920
Kimmity Cricket. What's wrong?

14:52.480 --> 14:54.400
Nothing. I'm just excited. It sounded good.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.600
All right. Kimmity Cricket asks,

14:58.720 --> 15:03.760
if you could talk to everyone in the world at the same time, what would your message be to them?

15:03.760 --> 15:06.160
I.e. don't use abusive comments.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.720
Okay. All right.

15:08.720 --> 15:16.640
You all realize, Bruce Almighty, you can talk, you can shoot out one message.

15:16.640 --> 15:23.440
You've grabbed the grocery store, like check out my PA microphone of the planet

15:23.440 --> 15:29.520
and say something into every human being's brain all at the same time.

15:29.520 --> 15:35.120
Let's say just for argument's sake, it is babble fish translated into every

15:35.120 --> 15:37.840
imaginable language simultaneously.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.720
You get one message to just blast out there, but one sentence and you can't get,

15:42.720 --> 15:45.440
you know, we oughta baby eats a boy with it.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.240
What is your message?

15:48.960 --> 15:51.440
I know what you did. No.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.080
No, Travis, you made a joke and you didn't even think about it.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.440
You came up with that before I even finished reading the question.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.760
This is important. We could solve some shit here.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.560
Okay. Well, I mean, my honest answer would probably be something about myself.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.720
Okay. Give me that.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.520
Give me that answer.

16:07.520 --> 16:13.280
It would probably be something like, I am Travis, you belong to me now.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.480
Something along those lines.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.360
That would be cool.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.280
I am Travis, protector of man.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.360
Or like something that really establishes like my godhood,

16:23.360 --> 16:25.760
I think would be how I would use it.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.880
See, I was trying to think of like, if we could get anything closer to world peace,

16:28.880 --> 16:33.040
but your solution might have a sort of like watchman-like effect where everybody would

16:33.040 --> 16:37.120
become so scared of the god voice, Travis, that they would all band together to like

16:37.120 --> 16:40.000
defend themselves for when his judgment descends.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.960
It could go the other way, Griffin, of like, they all feel so embraced by god Travis that

16:46.960 --> 16:50.640
they're like, what's the point of even fighting when we all know and love Travis?

16:50.640 --> 16:52.880
It's too dangerous, too dangerous, too dangerous.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.080
Your attack is too dangerous.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.720
I feel like whatever the message is, it has to start with,

16:57.920 --> 16:59.200
everyone be chill.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.800
I know this is wild.

17:00.800 --> 17:05.040
But, and then you can say whatever, like, I really, hey-

17:05.040 --> 17:06.320
Check out my Insta.

17:06.320 --> 17:09.440
Here's my new mixtape.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.360
My mixtape is on fire.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.360
It's WW, oh no, I ran out of-

17:16.800 --> 17:20.800
Go to buttercupisaveyagoodgirl.com and check out pictures of my dog.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.240
This is Travis, by the way.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.680
Teengoogle.com.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.280
Oh, I still have more?

17:25.280 --> 17:26.800
Bring back Tastations.

17:26.800 --> 17:27.840
420-420-

17:30.240 --> 17:32.320
How long is the message or is the length of the message?

17:32.880 --> 17:33.360
You'll know.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.680
You'll get a little light that blinks when it's time to wrap up.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.960
I think mine would be like, everybody be chill.

17:42.960 --> 17:47.840
I know this is weird, but, and then I would just write Beekman, greater sign,

17:48.800 --> 17:52.160
pointing towards Beekman, and Bill Nye.

17:52.160 --> 17:56.000
Because I want to get it out there that I think Beekman was the superior show.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.600
Beekman's World was a lot better than Bill Nye the Science Guy.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.760
I've been watching a lot of it on TV, and I just want to say that Beekman was better.

18:03.760 --> 18:08.640
But there's going to be like a four-year-old living in Turkey who's like,

18:08.640 --> 18:11.280
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, God Voice.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.360
No, unless it was, no, not in Spain, though.

18:13.360 --> 18:18.160
In Spain and in Latin America, they're going to go nuts for it because they don't love-

18:18.160 --> 18:19.360
They love Paul Zalum.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.800
They love his world that he created.

18:20.800 --> 18:25.680
But it's not a message that just reaches Latin America, Justin.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.480
It's the world, and I got to have something for everyone.

18:28.480 --> 18:34.400
What about everybody lean to the left, and we see if we can throw off the world's rotation?

18:34.400 --> 18:35.360
Oh, that's fun.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.080
That could be cool.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.960
Hey, everyone, I know this is weird, but be chill about it.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.240
But just give a freaking hug.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.560
That's the love language that spreads across all the world.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.760
Not everybody likes hugs, Griffin.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.320
Yeah, but yeah, you're right.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.880
Maybe like a knowing nod.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.480
Hey, everyone, nod at your friend.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.560
This is weird.

19:00.560 --> 19:01.840
So sorry to intrude.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.680
But give a knowing nod to a nearby person.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.280
I worry, though, if we end up with a simultaneous worldwide nod,

19:09.280 --> 19:11.440
that would also throw off the world's rotation.

19:13.600 --> 19:17.440
Everybody pick a random number of seconds and then nod at each other.

19:17.440 --> 19:17.680
Yeah.

19:17.680 --> 19:18.320
Yeah.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.840
That way we can stagger it.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.040
You know what could be really cool?

19:21.760 --> 19:24.000
If you could be like, hey, everybody, I know this is scary,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.120
but everything's gonna be okay, but listen, a sphincter says what?

19:30.080 --> 19:33.760
What about like, hey, everybody, I know this is weird, but be chill.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.200
Party at Derek's.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.680
And then everyone, the world would implode.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.160
Like there would be a sinkhole at Derek's house.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.800
Because all, what, there's like seven billion of us?

19:42.800 --> 19:43.760
Which Derek, Griffin?

19:43.760 --> 19:44.960
They would know.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.880
I think they would know your intent.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.920
You're right, I would have to say like, party at Derek F's.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.680
I am, okay, you know what, guys?

19:53.120 --> 19:55.040
I'm probably thinking too much about this

19:55.040 --> 19:58.000
because I'm starting to come around to this being an extremely good question.

19:58.720 --> 19:58.960
Yeah, no, for sure.

19:58.960 --> 20:02.320
I don't know what I would, if you have the ability to say,

20:02.320 --> 20:06.080
see, it's not like, you know, there's this concept of,

20:06.080 --> 20:08.800
if you point too much traffic at a website, they're not ready for it.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.080
You're gonna like melt the whole site.

20:12.080 --> 20:16.640
I feel like you could do that to anything with the world's attention.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.440
Like there's nobody, individually,

20:20.240 --> 20:24.640
that's going to be able to withstand complete like world attention.

20:24.640 --> 20:30.640
Which is what you would get, I think, with this sort of like awareness bombing.

20:30.640 --> 20:36.080
We could not accomplish anything specific or explicit, is what you're saying.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.800
Because anything we directed the world's attention to,

20:38.800 --> 20:45.280
so it has to be some sort of general message of mental well-being.

20:45.280 --> 20:50.480
And I think it also feels like it would have to be an inception kind of thing.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.520
I don't think we could say like everyone be nice.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.000
I think it would have to be like, for example,

20:56.880 --> 21:00.320
maybe you have like a product that you want to go viral,

21:00.320 --> 21:04.960
like you want the next Pogs, or you want, you have the next like Beanie Babies,

21:04.960 --> 21:06.080
or let's say like Pet Rock.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.280
Pet Rock would be a great example.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.040
Like you could send everyone a moment of saying like,

21:11.040 --> 21:13.840
haven't you always wanted a pet that doesn't wander off?

21:13.840 --> 21:17.280
But this is gonna, Travis, you're like really not listening,

21:17.280 --> 21:19.600
because this would destroy the Pet Rock industry.

21:19.600 --> 21:23.280
If all people on earth got horny for it, like we would run out of Pet Rock.

21:23.280 --> 21:27.280
Yeah, so it has to be, can I give you guys maybe the answer?

21:27.280 --> 21:30.000
Because this is, mine's almost threatening in a way,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.120
which is kind of like, it's like good for the spirit, but threatening,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.840
which is like kind of like deity-like.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.640
But it should be like, hey everybody, I know this is weird, but be chill about it.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.960
But listen, mean people suck.

21:40.960 --> 21:46.320
And then people hear that and they're like, wow, well, we know what not to be.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.880
And then they put a little love in their hearts.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.880
Okay, I think I know what I would actually write.

21:50.880 --> 21:51.200
Okay.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.360
I think I would write, hey, it's God.

21:58.400 --> 21:58.640
Whoa.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.160
I'm out, okay.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.280
Whoa.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.160
Whoa, what?

22:02.160 --> 22:03.920
Whoa, hold on, here's what I'm saying.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.280
I would say, hey, it's God, I'm out.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.880
Yep, I was real the whole time, but now I'm done-ski.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.080
Y'all got it from your own.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.120
Y'all got it from here.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.480
I was real, but I'm out.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.640
So y'all got it from here on out.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.120
That seems like a bad one to do.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.720
Yeah, that seems like that's actually the beginning of revelations.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.400
Yeah, it kind of seems like maybe you accidentally did the apocalypse.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.680
No, I think that mine, if you're coming at things from like,

22:31.680 --> 22:36.960
I think God would say like, hey, y'all be good to each other, keep it chill,

22:36.960 --> 22:41.760
but it isn't your individual hands, so please try to keep it sexy down there.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.480
Either way.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.720
Well, just say that.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.840
You don't have to pretend to be the Lord abandoning his sheep.

22:47.840 --> 22:52.320
You don't have to pretend to be the king of kings abandoning his flock.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.960
You can just say, hey, keep it sexy down there.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.080
No, no, no.

22:56.080 --> 23:00.240
I don't want people to try to continue to interpret my story.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.600
I want them to continue to interpret my will.

23:03.600 --> 23:08.720
I want them to know that I was real for a while, but now I'm going to leave,

23:08.720 --> 23:12.480
and they should try to keep their fucking shit together for a second.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.240
Well, then why not leave some ambiguity then and say like, I am God.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.080
I may or may not be leaving.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.360
It doesn't really matter.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.880
This is untenable.

23:20.880 --> 23:21.680
I am God.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.360
I'm out.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.840
I'll be back in 25.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.080
Keep it, oh my God.

23:28.080 --> 23:28.960
Hey, I'm God.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.000
Hey, it's me, God.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.120
I can't fix it, because that would be a powerful message.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.240
Now we are talking.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.200
Yes, yes, yes.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.160
It's me, God.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.160
Climate change is real, and it's out of my hands.

23:38.160 --> 23:38.960
And so am I.

23:38.960 --> 23:39.760
So am I.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.520
Here's two things that is real.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.560
Climate change would be, and here's something else that's real.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.800
I don't know about this one, gang, honestly.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.160
I don't know what to do.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.160
You all fucked up my world.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.200
I made it so good.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.680
I thought I made it so good you couldn't break it, but look at this.

23:53.680 --> 23:54.720
You done broke it.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.200
Yeah.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.880
Anyway, check out my SoundCloud.

23:56.880 --> 24:07.040
It's 10, here's another question for the haters.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.240
This is just for the haters.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.960
I recently went out for dinner with my girlfriend and some friends.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.560
We shared some appetizers, and I split an entree with my girlfriend.

24:16.560 --> 24:20.240
When the waiter came around and asked if we wanted dessert, everyone said no.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.440
Brothers, I really wanted that chocolate lava cake,

24:23.440 --> 24:25.920
but I didn't want to be the only one eating dessert.

24:25.920 --> 24:30.240
What could I have said or done during the meal or after to prevent this tragedy?

24:30.240 --> 24:34.160
And this from over-ordering in Ontario, Canada, I presume.

24:34.960 --> 24:39.280
This is maybe the best question we've ever gotten, so thank you for sending it in.

24:39.280 --> 24:39.520
Wow.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.880
There's a lot of dining etiquette with your friends,

24:42.880 --> 24:45.680
and a lot of this has been solved with technology.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.520
Stuff like Venmo or Splitwise or whatever.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.320
Vin Diesel.

24:50.960 --> 24:51.760
Vin Diesel, right.

24:51.760 --> 24:55.360
The appetizer you order, maybe not everybody gets a hand on that ball,

24:55.360 --> 24:57.680
so they don't, you know, have some of that.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.920
The entrees, maybe yours was more expensive than them.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.520
You have apps to deal with that.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.840
If you're the only one that wants dessert, now it's also a time issue.

25:05.840 --> 25:11.040
And I've been in this situation a lot.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.560
I just don't ever get the dessert.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.440
And it's my fault.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.480
It's my fault because I am not friends with the Sweet Tooth gang.

25:16.480 --> 25:18.480
I need to make Sweet Tooth friends.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.440
Here's the thing.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.480
Here's the thing, Griffin.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.680
Here's what you are doing wrong, as well as I wonderful,

25:23.680 --> 25:26.160
I appreciate them so much, question asker.

25:26.160 --> 25:30.000
And that is, you think you're the only one who wants dessert,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.360
so you didn't speak up.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.280
Everyone at the table is that.

25:33.280 --> 25:33.760
Oh, okay.

25:33.760 --> 25:38.720
Everyone at the, I have never, I've never been in this scenario

25:38.720 --> 25:41.120
where I said, you know what, I would like dessert.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.880
And everyone else hasn't gotten, well, like,

25:42.880 --> 25:43.920
whoa, if you're gonna do it.

25:43.920 --> 25:44.880
That's true.

25:44.880 --> 25:48.000
And in every, here's the real bellwether.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.920
Pick the dessert you want and say you want however many forks

25:51.920 --> 25:53.440
are for the people at the table.

25:53.440 --> 25:53.920
So good.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.600
Watch those motherfuckers not be like, oh, none for me, thank you.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.200
No, they're gonna have a fork.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.640
And you know what else they're gonna do?

26:00.640 --> 26:04.320
Guaranteed 80% of the time, someone at the table is gonna be like,

26:04.320 --> 26:06.800
well, if you're getting that, then I actually want the other one.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.200
Eventually, you will have every dessert in the restaurant

26:09.200 --> 26:10.080
brought to your table.

26:10.080 --> 26:10.960
Everybody's got a fork.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.000
They're loving it.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.560
They're enjoying, like, you're having a meal with friends

26:14.560 --> 26:16.560
and now you're splitting a delicious dessert.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.440
That's what we're on the fucking planet for, gang.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.720
This is what we are here for.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.280
And it's to reach out and grab this dessert that we're all here for.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.600
Let me tell you, here's the trick.

26:25.600 --> 26:30.640
What you do is you ask the server, the waitstaff person,

26:30.640 --> 26:32.880
to list the desserts out loud.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.240
Because when someone's looking at a paper, right,

26:36.240 --> 26:38.160
that's not a shared communal experience.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.880
Just ask and as they're listing them out loud,

26:40.880 --> 26:42.880
you make eye contact with everyone at the table

26:42.880 --> 26:45.760
and kind of nod a little bit, like, whoa, whoo.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.560
Ooh, that sounds good.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.520
Before any time has passed, you're having, like,

26:53.520 --> 26:58.240
a full-on, like, hedonistic dessert party.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.320
Have you ever been to a restaurant where they do the thing

27:00.320 --> 27:04.000
where they bring out, like, fake desserts for you to enjoy

27:05.040 --> 27:07.760
and you can, like, pick them from the fake ones?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.200
I've never done that before.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.040
But I've always kind of wondered what it would be like.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.240
It's pretty boss, dude.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.280
Yeah, as good as I imagined it would be.

27:17.280 --> 27:20.160
I've also been to a place where they brought out my steak

27:20.160 --> 27:23.120
pre-cooked, showed it to me, and said,

27:23.120 --> 27:25.040
is it, this looks good, right?

27:25.040 --> 27:26.160
And then went and cooked it.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.320
Here's a little teaser trailer for you, Trap.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.760
Well, this one is plastic.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.720
We will throw it away.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.800
Why don't we do this with a whole menu

27:34.800 --> 27:36.560
where they bring out, there's just sort of, like,

27:36.560 --> 27:40.640
a very strong sort of Lou Ferrigno type

27:40.640 --> 27:42.400
who's carrying many trays out

27:42.400 --> 27:44.960
and has every possible thing you could eat.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.040
And he kind of walks it around the restaurant

27:47.040 --> 27:51.360
constantly, sort of like somebody announcing the rounds

27:51.360 --> 27:53.200
at a prize fight or something like that.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.480
And then you can pick it off.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.800
I'll have what Lou Ferrigno is having

27:56.800 --> 27:58.240
on his left pectoral muscle.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.760
I believe that's the lasagna.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.040
I think we can all agree, like, the second most exciting thing

28:05.040 --> 28:08.640
when you go to Red Lobster is the big tank of lobsters

28:08.640 --> 28:09.520
and you pick your own lobster.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.520
So good, so good.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.720
The first most exciting thing

28:12.720 --> 28:14.400
is when the best biscuits come out.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.840
But the lobster in the tank,

28:15.840 --> 28:17.920
what if we just did that for fucking every,

28:17.920 --> 28:19.040
like you went in and said,

28:19.040 --> 28:21.120
and that's the broccoli I'll be having?

28:21.120 --> 28:21.440
Yeah.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.280
With like that potato,

28:23.280 --> 28:25.280
like the control you would feel.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.320
But the potato's floating in a big fish tank.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.480
Yeah, he's got googly eyes on him.

28:31.920 --> 28:32.720
They all have name tags.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.840
There should be a combination of groceries to a restaurant

28:35.840 --> 28:37.520
where you go grocery shopping

28:37.520 --> 28:39.440
and then you take your bags of groceries

28:39.440 --> 28:41.680
and you just upend them in the kitchen.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.280
So here, I can't.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.520
I've picked the freshest, all the finest,

28:45.520 --> 28:46.960
and all the freshest and fine.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.720
I've picked the freshest and the finest.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.960
Please make this into dinner for me.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.080
You know some chopped heads though

28:54.080 --> 28:56.720
would go in there with like some gummy bears,

28:57.520 --> 29:01.760
some jasmine rice, some surge and pork tummy

29:01.760 --> 29:03.360
and say like, do it, do it.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.960
Ha ha ha, you have 30 minutes.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.520
Those LOL dolls were clearly for my daughter.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.680
They weren't part of the meal and you know it.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.720
You've shamed me.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.000
But they are delicious.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.800
This is very good.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.240
Yeah, this is very good.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.680
You guys ever do that thing

29:15.680 --> 29:18.720
where you know you need to go to the grocery store

29:18.720 --> 29:20.400
and you put it off for so long

29:20.960 --> 29:24.640
that you end up coming home right at dinner time

29:24.640 --> 29:26.480
and you're in hell because all of a sudden

29:26.480 --> 29:29.280
you have no dinner and all these groceries to unload

29:29.280 --> 29:30.480
and no way to get dinner?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.320
Have you guys ever done that?

29:32.320 --> 29:34.480
Because I think that's a great time to order pizza.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.320
Ha ha ha.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.440
Who is this guy?

29:37.440 --> 29:38.560
Who's this character?

29:38.560 --> 29:40.320
So if I'm following you, Justin,

29:40.320 --> 29:41.360
what you're saying is,

29:41.360 --> 29:43.680
the problem is when you bring food home,

29:43.680 --> 29:44.640
you're faced with,

29:44.640 --> 29:47.360
well, now I have to do something with the food.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.720
No, I'd rather not.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.600
It's pizza o'clock.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.040
Yeah, I'm just saying that's a great time for my family

29:54.000 --> 29:55.440
for us to all order pizza.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.080
Honey, let's make it a night in with pizza.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.760
But you just went to the store.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.640
You have brought-

30:02.640 --> 30:05.280
Travis, quit fucking contradicting

30:05.280 --> 30:08.080
this incredible character Justin has said.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.680
Justin's created a new character here

30:09.680 --> 30:11.520
who I'm very enthusiastic about,

30:11.520 --> 30:12.800
which is time for pizza.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.920
Okay, we've got the pilot of Justin's sitcom,

30:17.920 --> 30:19.760
Time for Pizza, with Justin.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.560
I'm exhausted.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.680
I went to the store

30:21.680 --> 30:24.080
and I've bought all the freshest and finest

30:24.080 --> 30:25.760
and I don't want to cook anymore, honey,

30:25.760 --> 30:28.720
because I'm so tired from buying the groceries

30:28.720 --> 30:30.160
and I just was thinking,

30:30.160 --> 30:31.760
how about you and me and the kids?

30:31.760 --> 30:33.440
Rent Paddington 2 from Redbox.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.120
Wait, from Redbox?

30:37.120 --> 30:37.920
You're already home.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.160
Are you going to go back out to get the Paddington 2?

30:42.160 --> 30:43.600
The Rite Aid across the street

30:43.600 --> 30:44.880
that doesn't have any good groceries

30:44.880 --> 30:46.960
that does have a pretty good Redbox selection.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.320
They're going to rent Paddington 2

30:48.320 --> 30:49.840
and we're going to get a pizza tonight.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.680
Right on the special request

30:51.680 --> 30:53.200
of the Domino's pizza tracker.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.680
Could you just grab me Paddington 2 on the way?

30:55.680 --> 30:57.120
You can even stop by Rite Aid.

30:57.120 --> 30:57.760
That'd be great.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.320
They used to have,

31:00.320 --> 31:03.200
you remember for a while some chain had a deal

31:03.200 --> 31:05.680
where they'd bring you a DVD inside your pizza.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.160
I just remember they had a Drop Dead Fred

31:08.160 --> 31:09.040
was one of the options.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.440
So you could get Drop Dead Fred delivered to your house.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.160
And that was last year that they offered that,

31:14.160 --> 31:15.200
which was weird.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.160
The problem is the FBI saw that as domestic terrorism

31:18.160 --> 31:19.520
so they had to very much stop.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.480
Should we Money Zone?

31:22.480 --> 31:23.120
Yes, let's.

31:23.120 --> 31:34.480
Yeah, let's do it.

31:34.480 --> 31:38.480
Pizza Hut was giving away the films available

31:38.480 --> 31:40.240
or Bill and Ted Zamboni's journey,

31:40.240 --> 31:42.240
All Dogs Go to Heaven 2,

31:42.240 --> 31:44.480
Mr. Mom and Honeymoon in Vegas.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.840
Are you fucking with me?

31:45.840 --> 31:46.400
Wow.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.040
So good.

31:47.040 --> 31:51.120
I'll have four pizzas please so that I can complete this set.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.680
Yeah, I'm gonna need to get four pizzas.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.880
Hey, stamps are great

31:54.880 --> 31:56.720
and you're gonna need them this holiday season

31:56.720 --> 31:58.000
because this is the time of year

31:58.000 --> 31:59.920
where you're shipping off all of your stuff.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.560
You got presents of,

32:02.560 --> 32:04.560
you made a present of socks.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.920
You're gonna need to ship those off

32:05.920 --> 32:08.320
and they don't let you just put it in the mailbox

32:08.320 --> 32:10.080
without some of this postage on it.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.560
But thankfully stamps.com can save you a bunch of time

32:12.560 --> 32:13.920
during the hectic holiday season

32:13.920 --> 32:16.240
because it lets you buy and print official US postage

32:16.240 --> 32:18.240
for any letter, any package, any class of mail

32:18.240 --> 32:20.000
using your own computer and printer.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.280
Then the mail carrier picks it up.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.960
No trips to the post office required.

32:22.960 --> 32:23.680
You're gonna save time.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.720
You're gonna save money.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.400
Stamps.com is really the best gift

32:26.400 --> 32:28.480
you can give yourself this holiday season.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.440
It's so convenient.

We're professional businessmen,

32:30.880 --> 32:32.400
small business owners technically.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.040
Wait, what?

32:33.040 --> 32:34.880
We're always doing mail

32:34.880 --> 32:38.560
and fortunately we have a friend in stamps.com.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.640
So you can enjoy the stamps.com service

32:40.640 --> 32:42.720
with a special offer that includes a four-week trial

32:42.720 --> 32:44.480
plus postage and a digital scale

32:44.480 --> 32:46.080
without long-term commitments.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.040
Go to stamps.com,

32:47.040 --> 32:48.800
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

32:48.800 --> 32:50.960
and type in my brother, that's stamps.com.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.880
Enter my brother, all one word.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.040
Listen, there's some things out there

32:55.760 --> 32:58.320
that aren't super fun to think about

32:58.320 --> 33:02.800
like taxes or like when you get home from the supermarket

33:02.800 --> 33:04.160
and you have all your groceries

33:04.160 --> 33:05.600
and it's like, well, now I gotta make dinner.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.200
Oh, time for pizza, right?

33:07.200 --> 33:09.760
And also you have to get life insurance

33:09.760 --> 33:12.160
and it's not super fun.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.560
Like Teresa and I just like did our wills

33:14.560 --> 33:16.960
which is like a huge bummer

33:16.960 --> 33:19.280
but I can tell you that life insurance,

33:19.280 --> 33:20.320
once you've got it

33:20.320 --> 33:22.480
and you don't have to worry about it anymore,

33:22.480 --> 33:24.160
it's a really good feeling.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.720
So we wanna tell you about policy genius.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.320
Policy genius is the easy way

33:33.120 --> 33:34.800
to find the best policy for you.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.880
They also compare disability insurance,

33:36.880 --> 33:38.800
auto insurance and home insurance.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.920
So if you care about it, they cover it.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.640
So if you've been avoiding getting life insurance

33:44.640 --> 33:46.640
because it's difficult or confusing,

give policy genius a try.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.080
I got a message for Walt and Liz

34:02.080 --> 34:07.520
and it's from Knick, Ram, Will, Max, Julia, Miles and Dave.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.640
It says, Walt and Liz, congratulations on your engagement.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.360
All of your D&D pals are wishing you the absolute best

34:13.360 --> 34:16.800
the next year at D&D, Destiny and whatever new venue

34:16.800 --> 34:18.080
for hijinks we can imagine.

34:18.080 --> 34:22.880
On behalf of Maxwell, Ram, Knick, Julia, Miles and Dave,

34:22.880 --> 34:24.640
we couldn't think of a better way to say it

34:25.280 --> 34:28.480
than with the help of these brothers, you rock.

34:29.520 --> 34:32.160
And that's for April 17th.

34:32.160 --> 34:35.360
That's my birthday and your engagement day.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.920
Congratulations on this wonderful commitment.

34:37.920 --> 34:42.400
And it's also seven Gregorian months ago.

34:42.400 --> 34:46.080
That's fine because they wanted a good year at Destiny

34:46.080 --> 34:48.320
and I gotta tell you, it's been great.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.480
All my pals on there have been getting the best

34:50.480 --> 34:54.240
and biggest guns and I did find Master Chief in the game

34:54.240 --> 34:55.680
and Bungie sent me $500.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.200
There's another message here and it's for Alyssa

34:59.200 --> 35:01.520
and it's from Madeline or Madeline perhaps

35:01.520 --> 35:05.280
who and Alyssa says, happy birthday to my friend,

35:05.280 --> 35:07.600
my style icon, my favorite buff baby

35:07.600 --> 35:09.280
and my fellow trash person.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.360
Thank you for introducing me to Taz, Bim Bam

35:11.360 --> 35:12.960
and to countless clever turns of phrase

35:12.960 --> 35:14.560
that I have promptly stolen.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.880
Being friends with you has made me a better person

35:16.880 --> 35:17.760
and I love you.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.600
This is a, that's one of those word thieves

35:22.320 --> 35:24.880
and I think we gotta crack down on this.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.040
We've been letting word thieves off for too long.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.760
I don't have an end to that sentence.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.840
The problem, well, that's because someone stole it.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.040
Shit birds.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.800
Yeah, you were gonna have an end to that sentence

35:34.800 --> 35:36.480
and someone just swiped right in.

35:39.680 --> 35:40.800
Hi, I'm Dave.

35:40.800 --> 35:41.760
Hi, I'm Graham.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.880
And we're two house DJs who have been trapped

35:44.880 --> 35:46.480
inside our drum machine.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.800
We love it here and we'd love if you stopped by

35:48.800 --> 35:50.720
and visited us every week

35:50.720 --> 35:54.800
on Stop Podcasting Yourself here on MaximumFun.org.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.760
We're just a couple of doofuses from Canada.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.840
And listen to our show or perish.

35:59.840 --> 36:12.240
Shh, stop podcasting yourself on MaximumFun.org.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.760
There's a Yahoo, can I read?

36:13.760 --> 36:15.920
Or Justin, do you have one of your great segments?

36:15.920 --> 36:18.480
No, I don't have a segment.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
I just wanted to say that Papa John's

36:21.200 --> 36:22.400
did the movie thing too.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.000
And their offerings were Seen It Junior,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.440
The Best of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends,

36:29.440 --> 36:33.200
Durango Kids, or A Weekend at Bernie's 2.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.800
Jeez.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.960
You know that last one was just because

36:38.960 --> 36:41.920
Father John thought it was the funniest flick.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.440
The funniest shit.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.880
When they made this promotion,

36:44.880 --> 36:47.200
is it because they like found a box of DVDs

36:47.200 --> 36:48.720
like at a landfill or something?

36:48.720 --> 36:50.240
And they were like, well, we've got these.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.280
I bet you a copy of the Papa John's

36:53.280 --> 36:55.280
cuts of Rocky and Bullwinkle's

36:55.280 --> 36:58.560
gotta be worth like a good 10 large these days.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.520
10 large pizzas?

37:01.520 --> 37:04.560
Yes, this Yahoo was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.960
Thank you, it's an anonymous Yahoo answers user

37:06.960 --> 37:09.040
who I'm gonna call Father John, who asks,

37:10.160 --> 37:13.360
is it normal to be bored in ballet class?

37:14.400 --> 37:16.080
I want to be a ballerina,

37:16.080 --> 37:19.280
but sometimes I get bored or don't wanna go to class.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.080
Is this normal?

37:21.520 --> 37:22.400
It's a great question.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.040
Can you want to be a ballerina extremely badly

37:25.680 --> 37:28.160
and also be really bored by ballet

37:28.160 --> 37:30.400
and the learning it and you don't wanna do it?

37:31.440 --> 37:31.920
Tough.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.760
And I would argue that that is how

37:33.760 --> 37:37.760
like revolutionary ballerinas are born.

37:37.760 --> 37:38.800
I see.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.920
Right, because you're dancing there in class

37:41.920 --> 37:44.000
and you're like, ugh, so boring.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.920
But then maybe you make a friend

37:45.920 --> 37:48.960
and the dance that your friend does is like,

37:48.960 --> 37:51.760
really like, oh, what you're doing

37:51.760 --> 37:54.400
out there dancing, I don't know,

37:54.400 --> 37:56.400
on top of trash cans or whatever.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.360
Like that's the kind of dancing I should be doing.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.440
Let's dance together down the sidewalk,

38:01.440 --> 38:04.560
but I'm gonna combine my ballet dancing

38:04.560 --> 38:06.800
with your like cool new dancing.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.120
And now we've got, I don't know, good dancing.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.680
Look out Bob Fosse, we're good dancing.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.280
Bob Fosse sees it and explodes.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.280
Oh no, we've killed Bob Fosse.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.280
I tried to go to ballet class once.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.120
I showed up and they were like,

38:23.120 --> 38:24.240
where are your special shoes?

38:24.880 --> 38:26.960
And I said, I have no idea where y'all are getting

38:26.960 --> 38:31.120
these incredible special shoes for ballet.

38:31.120 --> 38:31.920
And they threw me out.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.080
I never, they never let me take a class there.

38:34.080 --> 38:37.200
I've been to plenty of paylesses in my day.

38:37.200 --> 38:39.600
I practically lived out of a payless through college.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.760
Never saw a single one of those kinds of special shoes

38:41.760 --> 38:43.360
that they said that were everywhere.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.360
Yeah, I've seen a lot of movies.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.720
And as far as I can tell-

38:46.720 --> 38:48.400
Thanks Trev, that's a great point.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.640
Well, I'm not done.

38:50.640 --> 38:51.600
Yeah, I know.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.280
I thought it'd be funny if I pretended like

38:53.280 --> 38:54.880
that was all you were saying is about

38:54.880 --> 38:55.920
how many movies you've seen.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.600
I've seen a lot of movies, mostly through pizza companies.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.680
And I've seen a lot of movies-

39:01.680 --> 39:04.240
Here gang, all the movies I've ever seen are from pizza.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.800
And let me hear, I'm here to tell you, movies aren't good.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.320
Like don't enjoy them.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.760
I don't know what all the hubbub is about.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.120
Movies are really bad.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.640
And sometimes they make sequels

39:14.640 --> 39:16.400
without making the original movie.

39:16.400 --> 39:16.880
And I think that that's-

39:16.880 --> 39:18.960
They didn't introduce any of the characters.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.720
I didn't know what was going on.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.800
But I'm pretty sure you get ballet shoes

39:22.800 --> 39:24.480
when you ask your papa.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.600
And your papa says that your family can't afford them.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.800
But then your papa, I don't know,

39:30.800 --> 39:34.160
either strikes it rich or like-

39:34.160 --> 39:36.640
Sells his magic pocket watch to afford.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.680
Something like that.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.400
And then like, happy birthday, ballet shoes.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.360
Elves make them.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.840
But we're dodging the question,

39:43.840 --> 39:46.080
which is that the class is so fucking boring.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.160
I want to be a ballerina so bad.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.680
God, I want to be a ballerina so bad.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.360
But I hate the dancing that they do

39:51.360 --> 39:52.880
because it puts me to sleep.

39:53.760 --> 39:54.000
God.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.840
Maybe it's the other people in the class.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.280
You know, maybe it's not the dancing,

39:57.280 --> 40:00.320
but rather like there's just no drama happening.

40:00.320 --> 40:01.040
It's possible, yeah.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.400
It could just have a boring teacher.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.600
You could have Ben Stein up there.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.240
But like, if I was doing the dance,

40:06.960 --> 40:08.400
you know, the dance.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.280
And then I looked over and it was like,

40:11.840 --> 40:14.240
I wish that those two people were gossiping.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.840
Or I wish I hated them.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.320
You know, something like that just to keep it spicy.

40:18.320 --> 40:23.280
You saw Black Swan and thought that it was gonna be cool,

40:23.280 --> 40:26.880
like that movie where all that cool stuff happens.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.240
I did once on a bus trip to New York with my choir,

40:30.240 --> 40:32.640
watch Center Stage like six times in a row.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.360
And it gave me, I would say,

40:35.360 --> 40:38.960
a skewed perspective on what the professional dance world is like.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.800
A lot of backstabbing.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.640
A lot of backstabbing.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.720
A lot of love triangles.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.200
My only exposure, excuse me, teacher, teacher,

40:49.200 --> 40:51.200
my only exposure to ballet before this,

40:51.200 --> 40:53.600
my first ballerina lesson, was Suspiria.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.840
So where is the witch who lives in the mirror?

40:55.840 --> 40:58.240
Because that seemed like an integral part of learning,

40:58.240 --> 41:00.400
you know, the different positions and stuff.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.280
What was the one with Julia Stiles?

41:03.280 --> 41:04.400
Save the Last Dance.

41:04.960 --> 41:05.920
Was that that one?

41:06.480 --> 41:08.880
Isn't that the movie you were talking about for a long time?

41:08.880 --> 41:10.720
Yes, it was for like two years.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.440
But I couldn't remember the title.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.960
Yeah, it was Save the Last Dance.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.000
They should make a prequel to that.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.240
Justin, please save us.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.760
Justin, please save us from this.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.520
Save the Pinocchio Dance.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.560
He saved it.

41:24.560 --> 41:25.280
Well, damn.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.120
Or what if it was just called Use Up All the Other Dances?

41:29.120 --> 41:29.360
Yeah.

41:30.880 --> 41:34.160
Waste the dances, but save the last dance.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.680
So how about another question?

41:37.280 --> 41:38.160
Bring a Game Boy.

41:38.160 --> 41:39.760
Bring a Game Boy to ballerina class

41:39.760 --> 41:45.120
and you can play Tetris and Pokemans and Bubble Bobble

41:45.120 --> 41:51.040
and Kicks and Qbert and all of the real games for real gamers.

41:51.040 --> 41:54.480
The Flash while you learn how to step on the tips,

41:54.480 --> 41:55.920
tippy tips of your toes.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.240
Like gravity doesn't apply to you like a beautiful bird.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.600
Justin, what's the next question?

41:59.600 --> 42:02.640
My boyfriend and I were traveling in New Zealand

42:02.640 --> 42:04.800
and we happened to be there for our anniversary.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.160
So we decided to go to the local aquarium to celebrate.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.760
We were in a small town.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.840
You don't have to make excuses for going to the aquarium.

42:11.840 --> 42:12.720
Aquariums are great.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.640
However, upon entering,

42:14.640 --> 42:17.920
we realized it doubled as the town's movie theater

42:18.480 --> 42:20.160
and in order to get to the showing,

42:20.160 --> 42:22.400
you had to walk through the aquarium.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.960
Tickets to the movies were about half as much

42:24.960 --> 42:26.640
as tickets to the aquarium.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.480
Even though the aquarium itself was so small,

42:28.480 --> 42:29.840
you could basically see the whole thing on your way

42:29.840 --> 42:31.280
to whatever movie you were seeing.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.520
But staff told you to keep your eyes down

42:33.520 --> 42:38.560
and not to linger if you needed to leave the theater

42:38.560 --> 42:40.320
to use the aquarium's bathroom.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.280
Holy shit.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.800
My question is, which is less morally depraved?

42:45.520 --> 42:49.120
Sneaking into a movie or sneaking into an aquarium,

42:49.120 --> 42:50.960
especially when they're in the same building?

42:50.960 --> 42:52.720
And that's from Still Confusing Cape Cod.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.560
This is a great question,

42:54.560 --> 42:57.120
but I would have to say for this question to apply,

42:57.120 --> 42:59.680
they would have to both be in the same building.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.640
Yeah, this is an extremely deeply not relatable question

43:02.640 --> 43:04.560
because this is the only building on earth

43:04.560 --> 43:08.720
where this situation will ever be an issue.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.960
I do gotta say it's a challenging one though

43:10.960 --> 43:14.560
because you're in there, you're watching Grimblewood's crimes

43:14.560 --> 43:16.800
and all of the great acting

43:16.800 --> 43:18.880
makes you wanna just piss your pants.

43:18.880 --> 43:21.200
And so you stand up and you go

43:21.200 --> 43:23.360
and while you're about to go to the bathroom,

43:23.360 --> 43:24.640
you're walking on your way there

43:24.640 --> 43:28.240
and you're hustling because you don't wanna miss any crimes.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.440
They're blasting off a crime in a minute in there.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.560
You do hear two excited teens saying like,

43:34.560 --> 43:39.040
that shark is really fucking the shit out of that other shark,

43:39.040 --> 43:40.800
but you can't look at that

43:41.760 --> 43:44.960
because you didn't pay to see this love act?

43:46.240 --> 43:49.680
What if you like, do you think that there's like,

43:49.680 --> 43:52.480
I don't know, like a hundred workers

43:52.480 --> 43:54.400
who are just waiting to see if you look up

43:54.400 --> 43:56.480
so they can charge you like,

43:57.040 --> 43:59.280
you look to the shark fuck, that's $20.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.240
Yeah, gotcha.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.960
Yeah, 20 New Zealand dollars too.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.080
Who knows how much that is?

44:04.080 --> 44:04.720
Nobody.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.560
Here's the thing, here's the good news about it.

44:06.560 --> 44:10.000
If you head over to the Picton Cinemas at 10.15 AM

44:10.000 --> 44:12.800
to 45 PM or 7.15 PM

44:12.800 --> 44:15.360
and get comfy for the next two hours and 14 minutes

44:15.360 --> 44:18.320
because you are going to be able to pay one price

44:18.320 --> 44:20.240
to see all the crimes of Grindelwald

44:20.240 --> 44:24.080
and then when you get bored, you go over to the aquarium.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.320
You got them both there in one

44:27.120 --> 44:29.280
and you can book online too, which is huge.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.400
But why would you get bored

44:30.400 --> 44:32.080
while watching the crimes of Gumbelbar?

44:32.880 --> 44:36.320
Is this the exact building that you, did you find it?

44:36.320 --> 44:38.640
Yeah, I've traced it to the Picton Cinemas.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.360
Do you think that there's another cinema in town

44:41.360 --> 44:45.680
that their tagline is, we don't have any fish.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.880
Don't be tempted by these rad fish.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.480
You don't have to pay for it.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.720
We're just Grindelwald over here.

44:52.720 --> 44:53.520
Oh, I said it right.

44:54.080 --> 44:57.120
No, you set him free, shoot.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.160
Now he's out there.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.520
I don't understand.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.800
Why is anyone coming to the movies?

45:00.800 --> 45:01.360
I've got it.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.680
And they just go and like buy a betta fish

45:03.680 --> 45:05.840
and like a little like, you know, bowl

45:05.840 --> 45:08.400
and they just put it on the concessions counter

45:08.400 --> 45:09.200
to try to try it.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.560
Don't look at the bowl though.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.040
Don't look at the bowl unless you pay me a dollar.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.280
But it's right next to the popcorn spray.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.040
Nope, nope, no.

45:17.040 --> 45:20.000
Eyes down, piss, eyes down, don't linger.

45:20.000 --> 45:20.960
Eyes down, piss somewhere.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.000
That's my bowl.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.160
Don't linger.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.920
What if all aquariums did this

45:29.920 --> 45:31.200
and they were like, come on in,

45:31.200 --> 45:33.680
you can use our space for a birthday party or whatever.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.160
If you look at one fish, so help me God.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.160
And then it's like a fun game.

45:38.160 --> 45:38.720
We should do that.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.800
We go to aquariums every time we travel

45:40.800 --> 45:44.800
because I don't know, we're big marine life fans, I guess.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.680
Next time I go in, I'll pay the admission price

45:47.680 --> 45:49.680
and see how long I can go without looking at

45:49.680 --> 45:52.240
one sort of aquatic creature that God made for us

45:52.240 --> 45:53.360
to enjoy in the ocean.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.320
Because I bet I can't go very long.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.600
No, they're right there.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.480
It's so tempting.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.920
Who could say no to that?

45:59.920 --> 46:01.360
I could do it for all the boring fish

46:01.360 --> 46:02.720
except for the one big window,

46:02.720 --> 46:05.360
which is the only cool part of the fish part of the aquarium.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.520
But then as soon as I get to Penguin Town,

46:07.520 --> 46:10.560
that's the ball game because I gotta see these guys.

46:11.200 --> 46:12.000
What are they up to?

46:12.000 --> 46:16.480
It's weird the sort of like, you go to the aquarium

46:16.480 --> 46:18.480
and it's weird how quickly you go from like,

46:18.480 --> 46:20.240
oh man, this is amazing to like,

46:20.240 --> 46:20.960
what do I care?

46:20.960 --> 46:22.320
It's just another tank full of fish.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.320
Wake me up when you got something better.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.200
Oh, it's swimming.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.480
Swimming, big deal.

46:26.480 --> 46:30.960
My ideal aquarium, it is all those walkway tunnels

46:30.960 --> 46:32.800
where you're inside because you can make believe

46:32.800 --> 46:34.240
that you're the fish now

46:34.240 --> 46:37.040
and you can do some light limpet play

46:37.040 --> 46:39.040
and then you do get into one big room

46:39.040 --> 46:44.160
with like the big panel that's open into the ocean

46:44.160 --> 46:47.120
and then there's a quick funnel cake break

46:47.120 --> 46:49.120
and then you're this Penguin Town baby

46:49.120 --> 46:50.480
and the penguins will see you out.

46:51.760 --> 46:56.480
I would like one room where it's just like thigh-high water

46:56.480 --> 47:00.240
that you actually wade through to get to the other side.

47:00.240 --> 47:00.480
Okay.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.400
Yeah, you're wet for the rest of it,

47:04.400 --> 47:07.600
but like also, listen, I spend all day in the aquarium

47:07.600 --> 47:09.040
and I'm looking at fish in water

47:09.040 --> 47:11.040
and I'm like, I'm here in the stupid air.

47:11.040 --> 47:11.200
Yeah.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.320
I wanna be in water.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.800
I'll tell you what I also need in my idealized aquarium

47:14.800 --> 47:18.560
is that at any point during this like very linear pathway,

47:18.560 --> 47:22.080
there can be like a little offshoot hall

47:22.080 --> 47:25.520
that you can, and the hall is like three quarters of a mile long

47:25.520 --> 47:27.680
and then at the end of that is like the petting place

47:27.680 --> 47:32.160
because I don't want to see, smell, experience that in any way

47:32.160 --> 47:34.080
without giving my explicit consent

47:34.080 --> 47:35.920
by making the long journey to it

47:35.920 --> 47:40.000
because that part of the aquarium always makes me quite sad.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.880
The horseshoe crabs don't wanna be touched there, Richard.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.920
And they smell not great.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.080
So like, I'm trying not to be mad at the horseshoe crabs

47:48.080 --> 47:48.880
for their bad smell

47:48.880 --> 47:50.800
because I know they're not going through a great time either

47:50.800 --> 47:52.480
what with all of their Richard touching.

47:53.760 --> 47:56.320
I would say if I worked at an aquarium,

47:56.320 --> 48:00.080
I would take special care, well, of the fish,

48:00.080 --> 48:02.560
but also like whenever I'm making the little plaques

48:02.560 --> 48:05.200
that go next to the tanks,

48:05.200 --> 48:08.400
I would add some like fun details in there

48:08.400 --> 48:10.400
that maybe aren't super true,

48:10.400 --> 48:12.560
but I've also been to lots of aquariums

48:12.560 --> 48:15.600
and I've never seen a human being read those plaques before.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.600
Absolutely not.

48:17.600 --> 48:18.880
Tell me about this fish.

48:18.880 --> 48:20.400
This blue, it's got a stripe

48:20.400 --> 48:22.400
and it's about the size of my hand.

48:23.040 --> 48:23.520
Yep.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.320
I'm good to go.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.080
I figured that one out on my own.

48:26.080 --> 48:28.000
I would add into the plaque something like,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
and if you listen really closely,

48:30.000 --> 48:31.520
you could hear it speak English

48:32.720 --> 48:35.280
and then just like watch people like lean into the glass

48:35.280 --> 48:36.160
like, what, really?

48:36.160 --> 48:37.600
I mean, that panel could just say like,

48:37.600 --> 48:40.480
hey, shithead, you're a piece of garbage.

48:40.480 --> 48:41.840
You're an idiot because you're not,

48:41.840 --> 48:43.600
I bet you're not going to ever read this.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.960
Oh, we can combine two bits from this episode.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.880
Let me pick which fish I want to eat

48:48.880 --> 48:50.240
as I walk through the aquarium.

48:50.240 --> 48:50.720
To the restaurant.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.720
No, I think you got to catch it.

48:52.720 --> 48:55.280
I think it's up to you to catch it.

48:55.280 --> 48:57.040
Well, I mean, this is an aquarium, right?

48:57.040 --> 49:02.080
So you can pay more for, you know, a tool of some sort.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.440
Would that change the way you feel

49:03.440 --> 49:04.960
about the petting area, Griffin?

49:04.960 --> 49:07.120
If you just reached in, picked up a starfish

49:07.120 --> 49:08.560
and then threw it in a deep fryer.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.080
Only if I, I would not feel comfortable doing that

49:16.080 --> 49:17.600
because he would be flopping in a way

49:17.600 --> 49:19.280
that would sort of mean like,

49:19.280 --> 49:21.760
it's time, it's not my time to die, Griffin.

49:22.320 --> 49:25.120
But I will say what's going to get me over the hump

49:25.120 --> 49:28.480
is if there is, and this could be like a person in costume

49:28.480 --> 49:31.680
or maybe just the actual guy made flesh,

49:31.680 --> 49:33.600
but the chef from Little Mermaid,

49:33.600 --> 49:36.000
who's singing his great song about killing all the animals.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.400
Yeah, him, if he's doing it,

49:39.040 --> 49:40.800
then I feel like I would get into the spirit

49:40.800 --> 49:42.640
of his fun sort of murder song.

49:42.640 --> 49:43.440
And I would throw this,

49:43.440 --> 49:45.440
I'd plop the swordfish right down in that hot bath.

49:46.160 --> 49:47.280
Yeah, and you know what?

49:47.280 --> 49:51.040
Maybe like, maybe ease my morals a little bit

49:51.040 --> 49:52.720
and tell me that like all the fish

49:52.720 --> 49:54.640
in this room are super old.

49:54.640 --> 49:55.760
That could be good.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.280
Or maybe they're all jerks.

49:57.280 --> 49:58.720
Maybe there's another long tunnel

49:58.720 --> 50:00.480
that the fish can swim through

50:00.480 --> 50:04.000
and it's a one-way trip and it ends in the fish kitchen.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.800
And then they know,

50:07.440 --> 50:09.360
I've had a lot of fun entertaining children.

50:09.360 --> 50:11.360
I've seen a lot of noses pressed up to glass.

50:11.920 --> 50:12.960
I'm ready.

50:12.960 --> 50:14.400
It's time to make the donuts.

50:14.400 --> 50:16.000
And it's time to make me donuts.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.960
And then they know, and it can be fun.

50:22.960 --> 50:23.920
There can be like,

50:23.920 --> 50:26.400
and then they can play music on the tunnel

50:26.400 --> 50:28.000
and they can have pictures of their friends

50:28.000 --> 50:29.280
and kids on the tunnel.

50:29.920 --> 50:32.400
That's nice, like an elephant graveyard kind of thing.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.160
It's like the end of Big Fish,

50:34.160 --> 50:36.160
which is great and appropriate.

50:39.200 --> 50:41.360
Folks, that's gonna do it for us this week.

50:41.360 --> 50:43.360
Thank you so much for joining us.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.640
We always love having you here.

50:45.200 --> 50:46.560
And we...

50:47.120 --> 50:49.600
I also wanna say thank you to J.K. Rowling

50:49.600 --> 50:53.040
for paying for this sponsored episode.

50:53.040 --> 50:53.920
We should have mentioned that,

50:53.920 --> 50:56.240
but like your support means a lot.

50:56.800 --> 50:59.120
Yeah, we've done sponsored episodes in the past,

50:59.120 --> 51:01.040
but none where we've explicitly said

51:01.040 --> 51:03.600
not to patronize the product

51:03.600 --> 51:05.920
that has given us money to sponsor it.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.160
So this is a unique way of doing things.

51:08.160 --> 51:11.680
And thank you, J.K. for the support.

51:12.880 --> 51:16.080
We also wanna say thanks to Maximum Fun Network

51:16.080 --> 51:19.200
for having us as a part of their extended podcasting family.

51:20.080 --> 51:23.120
We have a newsletter you can sign up for

51:23.120 --> 51:26.480
at bit.ly forward slash McElroy Mail.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.400
It's not a pyramid scheme, which is really important.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.600
A lot of people have asked us about that,

51:33.600 --> 51:35.840
and it's not, we're not sure who keeps saying that.

51:35.840 --> 51:39.200
We've seen buzzings about it in the blogosphere.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.000
Not a pyramid scheme.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.920
It is not a pyramid scheme.

51:41.920 --> 51:45.840
Oh, hey, we will have another episode

51:45.840 --> 51:49.920
of our annual eternal podcast.

51:49.920 --> 51:51.360
Son of a gun.

51:51.360 --> 51:53.040
Till death do us blart

51:53.760 --> 51:56.720
will arrive on American Thanksgiving

51:56.720 --> 51:58.000
as it has every year

51:58.000 --> 52:00.880
and will continue to until the end of linear time.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.680
It will be the fourth episode of the show,

52:03.680 --> 52:05.360
which means that we're going to be watching

52:05.360 --> 52:07.120
the film Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

52:07.120 --> 52:08.560
with our friends Tim and Guy.

52:09.680 --> 52:12.080
Y'all, I bought it on Blu-ray this year.

52:12.080 --> 52:13.040
I'm excited.

52:13.040 --> 52:14.240
I'm still renting it.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.880
Straight up, Guy is in India.

52:16.880 --> 52:21.120
I have no idea how we're gonna get all this together,

52:21.120 --> 52:24.000
but it will be there on Thanksgiving Day

52:24.000 --> 52:25.360
and we hope you enjoy it.

52:25.360 --> 52:26.800
Till death do us blart is the name of that.

52:26.800 --> 52:27.760
I didn't give the hard plug.

52:27.760 --> 52:29.120
Till death do us blart.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.640
Subscribe now.

52:30.640 --> 52:33.440
There's four, sorry, three episodes to catch up on.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.640
Yeah, let's see.

52:34.640 --> 52:35.120
What else?

52:35.120 --> 52:36.640
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

52:36.640 --> 52:37.520
for these four theme songs.

52:37.520 --> 52:38.480
It's a departure off the album,

52:38.480 --> 52:39.360
putting the days to bed.

52:39.360 --> 52:42.320
Great album, great song, great dude, great vibes.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.360
We've got our shows coming up in Austin and Denver.

52:45.360 --> 52:47.680
So make sure you send those questions in now

52:47.680 --> 52:50.400
with Denver or Austin in the subject line.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.360
Let's wrap it up.

52:51.360 --> 52:51.920
Wrap it up.

52:51.920 --> 52:52.560
That's it.

52:52.560 --> 52:53.040
We're good.

52:53.680 --> 52:54.960
You're the one who does it though.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.000
So like, what are you waiting?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
So here's a final Yahoo.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.600
This one was sent in by Bree McNeil.

52:59.600 --> 53:00.160
Thank you, Bree.

53:00.160 --> 53:02.560
It's Yahoo Answers user Sierra.

53:02.560 --> 53:03.360
Who asks?

53:05.040 --> 53:06.720
Explain Keenan and Kel.

Hey Kyra, so Max Funcon tickets go on sale

53:43.760 --> 53:46.640

53:48.160 --> 53:50.880
Okay, so what do they need to know to look forward to?
