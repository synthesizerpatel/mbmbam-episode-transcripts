00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.480
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.480 --> 00:58.000
But today, in recognition of our musical brothers who've been left out of the Grammy awards today,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.400
we are going to be honoring, for the majority of today's show,

01:02.400 --> 01:05.680
we're going to be picking up the categories that they let go of.

01:05.680 --> 01:12.240
Travis, who took home the best new Zydeco of the fourth quarter award?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.840
It was Zydeco Jones.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.680
Zydeco Jones. I loved his second album, which was titled?

01:19.440 --> 01:21.040
Movement in Zydeco.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.080
You are bad at this.

01:24.080 --> 01:37.360
I, some of my top Zydeco acts are the, I loved the Louisiana Creoles this year were great.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.800
What about the Creole Opry? I like that one.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.320
I like the Zydeco Sisters.

01:43.520 --> 01:50.320
That was pretty good. I like Mojo Johnson and his Timbuktu twins. I love, they had a great year

01:50.320 --> 01:54.480
with, they came out with a Cupid Shuffle and Lil Bootsy.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.160
And Three Accordions, One Dream.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, that was really good. They're out of Port Arthur, Texas.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.040
They got together while working in an oil refinery.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.440
They studied under Clifton Schneer, who of course is regarded in most circles as the king of Zydeco.

02:11.360 --> 02:15.520
I am going to miss the Zydeco Polka that Weird Al always treats us to every year,

02:16.320 --> 02:17.840
combining all the winners into one.

02:17.840 --> 02:23.440
And we're going to let, this year the Grammys let go of best Zydeco, best Tejano album,

02:23.440 --> 02:30.160
that seems poorly timed, as we are now largely a Hispanic nation, and a Cajun music album, out.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.720
Best contemporary folk, out.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.880
It seems awful bold and brassy of them to just be like, ah, nobody cares.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.240
Get out of here, Zydeco. Nobody wants you.

02:43.200 --> 02:43.600
Maybe if-

02:43.600 --> 02:44.800
That's not real music.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.440
Yeah. If Katy Perry did Zydeco,

02:47.440 --> 02:51.040
then maybe it would be the worst thing that anyone could ever hear.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.280
Maybe it would be unlistenable.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.920
It's not even like we're going to announce these awards given earlier.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.160
We're just not going to do them.

03:00.160 --> 03:04.880
I think it was, I can't believe that they boxed out Best Gregorian Chant 2011.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.560
Yeah.

03:06.560 --> 03:10.560
They got tired of Nickel Creek winning it every-

03:10.560 --> 03:11.200
Every single time.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.080
Hey, um-

03:12.080 --> 03:15.280
How about Best Band with- Best Band with Nickel in it?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.400
Best Band with Nickel in it.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.160
Nickel- Nickelback.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.360
Nickel Creek.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.000
Nickel Creek.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.440
Nickels Jones, who is another Zydeco-

03:21.440 --> 03:22.880
Tommy Nickels and the Two Cents.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.760
Mm-hmm.

03:23.760 --> 03:24.320
Yeah.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.280
And Jack Nicklaus.

03:27.280 --> 03:27.840
Yep.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.040
Golden- Golden Bear.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.560
Golden Bear things, the golden hits.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.360
Hey, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.200
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.960
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.560
We're actually an advice show in addition to a Zydeco fan cast.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.040
Um, so let's get into the actual advice, and we'll go-

03:43.040 --> 03:45.120
We'll circle back around to more Zydeco chat.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.520
Uh, I'm a 22-year-old girl.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.600
I've recently broken up with my long-term boyfriend.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.960
We dated since we were in high school.

03:50.960 --> 03:51.920
We broke up two months ago.

03:52.800 --> 03:58.320
Our anniversary would have been on Monday, February 13th, the day before Valentine's Day.

03:58.320 --> 04:03.920
Do you have any sagely advice for what a newly single girl can do on her not-iversary

04:03.920 --> 04:07.360
that's from new to the not-iversary?

04:08.320 --> 04:09.120
Um-

04:09.120 --> 04:09.620
Is it?

04:09.620 --> 04:11.120
Um-

04:11.120 --> 04:11.680
Do you know what?

04:11.680 --> 04:12.240
You can't call-

04:12.240 --> 04:17.600
The problem is you're calling it an not-iversary instead of what it really is, which is Monday.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.440
That is the- that is the truth.

04:23.440 --> 04:24.880
You are making a fake-

04:24.880 --> 04:26.960
The days are the pits.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.440
Any day, if it is a day other than-

04:29.440 --> 04:33.200
No one's ever said, I had an unexpectedly good St. Patrick's Day.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.240
Every holiday is always either a letdown or on par,

04:36.240 --> 04:38.560
but you can have an unexpectedly good Monday.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.360
Like, I don't know.

04:39.360 --> 04:39.680
No.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.480
Kind of worked out.

04:40.480 --> 04:46.400
I went to the Thai house, saw that, uh, that, uh, for the love of the game on K1 cable.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.240
It was a pretty good Monday.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.880
You can't top a not-iversary, though.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.760
How do you turn a not-iversary into a fucking full-blown rage?

04:55.760 --> 05:01.760
I guess you- see, if it were me, you would start with buying myself an ice cream cake.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.000
Yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.640
And then end with eating that ice cream cake.

05:04.640 --> 05:05.040
Yeah.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.800
Maybe you should be celebrating your freedom.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.520
Maybe this is a liber-diversary or something.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.880
Because you're out there looking on the prowl again, on the hunt.

05:12.880 --> 05:19.040
Shark- sharks can't stay- sharks can't stay still because they will drown in the-

05:19.040 --> 05:21.520
some of the plankton in there, in the ocean.

05:21.520 --> 05:21.920
Uh-huh.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.800
Sharks gotta move-

05:22.800 --> 05:24.560
The krill- the krill is so thick.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.360
The krill- you gotta shake the krill out your gills.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.000
It's 20-

05:28.000 --> 05:30.080
Shake the krill out damn grills.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.200
Krills.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
Shakes- well, your- well, your gills.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.560
Shake the krill out bare gills.

05:36.560 --> 05:50.400
Shake the krill out them gills and get to sharking again.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.640
You gotta get out there and start swimming forward.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.760
You can't stop.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.960
It's time for a new boy.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.080
All boy's done.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.520
Done ski over.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.640
He's in the rear view.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.960
You know, now that you said that, I'm gonna throw out a term that you've just inspired me to,

06:02.960 --> 06:03.440
Justin.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.520
Feeding frenzy.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.400
Oh my god.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.600
Frenzy.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.680
How do you turn an anniversary into a feeding frenzy?

06:11.680 --> 06:13.120
You are three gobbles away.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.240
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.600
Shark- sharpen up the teeth.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.200
Get out there.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.280
Get your- your pack of ladies together.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.760
Oh, all the single ladies.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.120
All the single ladies.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.680
Make a shark shack, a murder of sharks.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.000
Yeah.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.000
Just shark pack it.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.360
Get out to the club.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.280
You want to hook up before midnight, though, because at midnight, you're still single.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.480
You're just a lonely heart.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.520
But right now, you're a motivated seller.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.880
And maybe just crush some hearts, you know?

06:40.880 --> 06:41.920
Oh, thank them.

06:41.920 --> 06:42.240
Yeah.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.040
Get the free drinks, bite your eyelashes, and then laugh in their face.

06:47.040 --> 06:47.840
And then bite them.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.280
Bite them and their surfboard.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.720
Bite their surfboard and their legs.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.560
What's the problem, officer?

06:52.560 --> 06:53.920
He look like a seal.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.640
Nom, nom, nom.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.040
I'm in a feeding frenzy.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.640
There was a drop of blood in the bar.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.560
I could smell it a mile away.

07:00.560 --> 07:04.720
If you go- if you go on a feeding frenzy, though, you got to be safe and protect it.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.280
Yeah.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.160
And the- and the cop will be like, oh, yeah, feeding frenzy.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.240
I heard about that on my brother, my brother and me.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.440
That makes total sense.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.640
Trying to get it started.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.320
Feeding frenzy.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.360
It's a thing I heard.

07:16.960 --> 07:17.600
Move along.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.280
Go on ahead.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.320
I'm pretty drunk.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.600
It's also my nautiversary.

07:24.640 --> 07:27.120
It's my nautiversary from sobriety.

07:27.120 --> 07:27.520
Sorry.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.080
Sorry.

07:28.080 --> 07:28.800
I'm a cop.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.120
You're under arrest.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.040
I- I think those are our very good suggestions.

07:36.400 --> 07:36.960
You're welcome.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.040
All this is, of course, coming back to taking a bite of the recovery sandwich.

07:41.040 --> 07:45.200
It's time to get back out there and normally it wouldn't be time, but it's cold.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.400
It's cold outside.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.920
You don't want to be alone.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.720
I don't know.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.320
I don't- I don't know how people do it.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.320
You know, sans snuggles.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.440
It's the- it's the body's most natural way of eating itself.

07:56.160 --> 07:56.640
Yeah.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.520
Yesterday there was a- there was a strange sex marathon on Nat Geo.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.360
You really telling me you want to watch that alone?

08:04.240 --> 08:05.280
You can handle that?

08:05.280 --> 08:05.600
Wait.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.000
Hold on.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.320
Wait.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.560
Nat Geo is like, check out these freaks.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.520
Nat Geo is so dope.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.440
Okay, here's the lineup on Nat Geo.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.200
First, doomsday preppers.

08:15.840 --> 08:20.240
Where people get ready for the doomsday and you watch them and you are happy you're not them.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.000
They got undercover police.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.360
You're happy that you're not them now.

08:23.360 --> 08:28.880
Right, until Quetzalcoatl rears his head out of a dormant volcano.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.000
Until they become like the Duke of Las Cruces.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.840
Yeah, number one.

08:34.560 --> 08:36.480
Yeah, I'm the king.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.600
And then they got undercover princes.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.160
They got that.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.280
They're crushing it with that.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.720
Is that like the Disney film?

08:43.440 --> 08:47.360
No, there's like- I mean, it is similar to the plot of a Disney film.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.000
These princes want a lady who wants them for them.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.920
So they shuck their finery and they get out there and try to meet someone based on their own

08:57.040 --> 09:00.480
fairly limited skill set of nothing.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.640
And this is all on Nat Geo just waiting for you.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.920
Nat Geo sounds like their shit is just really messed up.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.640
But then you said Nat Geo has a show about like-

09:09.600 --> 09:10.160
Bonin?

09:10.160 --> 09:11.600
Fist- fist- well, fisting.

09:12.240 --> 09:12.560
Whoa!

09:13.760 --> 09:16.880
This is gonna sound like I'm fucking with you.

09:16.880 --> 09:23.200
I watched- I watched an episode of Strange Sex yesterday about a man who's-

09:24.080 --> 09:25.520
his penis went missing.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.960
He couldn't find his penis.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.320
He had an inverted penis.

09:28.320 --> 09:28.800
Oh, man.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.360
And it's because he's had such a chub down there.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.800
And he said- and he actually uttered the line,

09:34.800 --> 09:40.400
I realized for the first time in 15 years, I looked down and I could see my genitals.

09:41.680 --> 09:42.320
How is that a-

09:42.320 --> 09:42.960
Genitals.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.560
How's that a shock?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.720
How's that not like a daily, like, affirmation?

09:46.720 --> 09:49.040
Like, what the- yep, still there.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.640
How does your penis go missing?

09:51.440 --> 09:55.600
It went inside- back inside of him because of the panacea there.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.000
There's so much chub in that region.

09:58.000 --> 09:58.960
It's basically like-

09:58.960 --> 09:59.600
His pubis?

10:00.640 --> 10:03.760
His pubis swelled to the point where his penis inverted.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.360
Wow, we've just lost every single person that has ever been to our show ever.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.440
All right, let's talk about secrets now because we're the only people under the

10:11.440 --> 10:15.360
people under the thrall of our voices that is-

10:15.360 --> 10:18.080
Let us swap social security numbers.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.680
Is his penis a ghost?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.480
No, yeah, no, his penis saw its shadow.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.880
Six more weeks of sleeping on the couch, Darryl.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.520
Griffin, why don't you rescue us with a yahoo?

10:33.520 --> 10:36.560
Sure, I'll pull us out of this as a penis.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.240
Like a- like a- like a penis.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.880
Pull it out like an inverted penis, Griffin.

10:40.880 --> 10:41.680
You could do it.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.120
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.160
Thank you, Lisa.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.280
It's by yahoo answers user David McMillan, who asks,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.360
Is it wrong to call a woman handsome?

10:50.800 --> 10:53.760
I sort of got in trouble for this the other day, but I defended myself.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.920
Some women could just be described as handsome.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.680
It doesn't mean that they are a lesbian.

10:57.680 --> 11:02.000
It just means that they are not exactly feminine looking, but they are still attractive.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.360
Does anyone know what I mean here?

11:03.360 --> 11:04.400
Can I get an amen?

11:06.000 --> 11:06.640
Amen.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.480
Amen, I guess.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.480
Is the woman a horse?

11:10.480 --> 11:11.200
Because that's cool.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.720
There are, I would say, few objects on this planet that I-

11:15.360 --> 11:17.280
I would reserve the word handsome for.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.360
Do you know what I mean?

11:20.080 --> 11:20.880
Like a saddle?

11:21.440 --> 11:25.680
A saddle or a- or a- oh, those are some handsome slacks.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.160
Something like that.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.120
Yeah, like that's a handsome flower arrangement.

11:29.920 --> 11:34.720
But I don't think it- I don't think you can- I just don't think it.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.240
Cybill Shepherd is a handsome woman.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.120
That's a good point, Travis.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.120
Kathy Bates is a handsome woman.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.640
Well, let's not go crazy.

11:43.680 --> 11:47.840
But what you- but what you're saying is- is that, like,

11:47.840 --> 11:50.320
hey, you got kind of a Cybill Shepherd thing going on.

11:50.320 --> 11:50.800
That's-

11:50.800 --> 11:52.800
Oh, I don't think in any way it's a compliment.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.320
Well, it does.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.320
It kind of makes her sound like a dame, right?

11:56.320 --> 11:58.320
Like- like a- like a handsome broad.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.080
I like your getaway sticks, you handsome broad.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.320
Is Maggie Smith handsome?

12:05.120 --> 12:06.560
Yeah, Maggie Smith is handsome.

12:06.560 --> 12:12.240
No, she is like a- she's like a- some sort of sea creature.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.080
She's not a handsome woman.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.520
Like, uh, who's a handsome woman?

12:16.080 --> 12:16.640
Still.

12:16.640 --> 12:20.480
Somebody- uh, you know, Diane Keaton is a handsome woman.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.800
I don't under- I still don't understand the distinction,

12:22.800 --> 12:25.680
because I would say that she is- she's just- she's just-

12:25.680 --> 12:29.600
It's- I think it's like- I think it's like saying my granddad would probably want to hit it.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.000
Yeah.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.840
I think that's what a handsome woman means, right?

12:31.840 --> 12:33.920
It means like she has moxie, she has spunk.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.240
No, it's like you can appreciate what's going on there.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.600
It's just not for you.

12:38.080 --> 12:42.240
You know how sometimes, like, old people will say, like, if I were 20 years younger,

12:42.240 --> 12:44.800
I think saying something- someone as a handsome woman is saying, like,

12:44.800 --> 12:47.360
if I were 20 years older, I would hit that.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.640
Yeah, I think that that's true.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.680
That's horrible, though.

12:50.240 --> 12:50.560
Yeah.

12:50.560 --> 12:50.880
I know.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.640
I don't know why you would say it to somebody.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.400
It's a terrible thing to say about anyone.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.120
Yeah, it's not a nice thing to say about a woman.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.840
Although, I mean, like, I- is it- is it-

12:59.840 --> 13:02.560
If Simple Shepherd is listening, I meant it as a compliment.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.600
I'm a shepherd.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.280
Loved you on Sibyl.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.080
Siby.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.200
Siby, you know I love you.

13:07.200 --> 13:07.920
I didn't mean it.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.640
Sibs.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.480
Travis, if somebody said you were pretty-

13:11.280 --> 13:12.800
I'd take that as a compliment.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.640
That would treat you- that would treat you well?

13:14.640 --> 13:15.200
Yeah.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.160
I'd take pretty.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.800
If someone said, like, well, there's a beautiful man, like-

13:18.800 --> 13:20.320
They didn't say beautiful, though.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.120
They said pretty.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.080
There's a pretty man.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.880
Well, I do have my foppish ways about me.

13:24.880 --> 13:25.680
I don't have a problem with that.

13:25.680 --> 13:30.400
But, see, you're- you're- I don't- I don't see- let's just- can we make all-

13:30.400 --> 13:34.880
all, like, pleasant adjectives totally asexual?

13:35.680 --> 13:39.280
What if it was just, like, that is, like, an attractive person?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.880
Well, or we can just say that anything can be handsome.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.000
Anything can be pretty.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.400
Lovely.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.040
Justin, you-

13:47.040 --> 13:47.520
Lovely?

13:47.520 --> 13:50.240
I haven't told you this lately, but you are just lovely.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.040
You are divine.

13:51.760 --> 13:57.680
Now, lovely and divine sounds like something you'd say, like, about your-

13:57.680 --> 14:03.520
like, about your best friend who everybody thinks is gay but really isn't gay.

14:03.520 --> 14:03.840
Yeah.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.520
Oh, he's a lovely person.

14:05.520 --> 14:05.840
What if-

14:05.840 --> 14:06.960
He's a lovely person.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.040
Travis, you are shapely.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.320
Have I told you that lately?

14:10.320 --> 14:11.120
Thank you, Griffin.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.280
Griffin, I think you are pulchritudinous.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.240
Okay, Travis.

14:14.240 --> 14:14.640
What is-

14:14.640 --> 14:15.280
Deal with it.

14:15.280 --> 14:15.840
What does that mean?

14:15.840 --> 14:16.400
You know what?

14:16.400 --> 14:17.120
You're pretty.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.200
You're painterly, I think.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.160
You're symmetrical.

14:20.160 --> 14:20.880
Painterly.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.280
Okay.

14:21.280 --> 14:21.840
That's good.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.600
But that's- now we're talking, like, robot.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.120
Yeah.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.280
If you're- if you're- if you- if you say somebody has very Roman features,

14:31.120 --> 14:34.160
I think that's good, because that is a nice way of saying, like,

14:34.720 --> 14:38.800
you don't look nice, but maybe, like, a million years ago, back in Rome.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.120
Yeah.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.080
What's the- which-

14:40.080 --> 14:40.320
Totally stickable.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.160
Remind me, comely or homely?

14:42.160 --> 14:44.320
Which one's the compliment and which one's offensive?

14:44.320 --> 14:46.880
Did you say com- did you say comely?

14:46.880 --> 14:47.760
A comely wench.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.520
You mean comely, sir.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.160
Excuse me?

14:52.160 --> 14:53.040
How did you pronounce it?

14:53.040 --> 14:54.240
You said it like it was dirty.

14:54.240 --> 14:54.740
Comely.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.920
Kevin, I need a ruling.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.080
Is it comely or comely?

15:00.080 --> 15:01.840
I- both are bad.

15:02.960 --> 15:03.760
Don't Google it.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.160
I need to know this for real.

15:06.160 --> 15:11.600
I try to excise that word from as many other larger words as I possibly can,

15:11.600 --> 15:13.440
so I'm gonna go comely.

15:13.440 --> 15:13.940
Yeah.

15:14.960 --> 15:15.440
Yeah.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.720
Justin, if it makes you feel better, I'm willing to say that someone is a humbly wench.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.080
I- that does not make me feel better at all.

15:22.080 --> 15:27.600
I- I think there is a certain class of- of- of words you use to describe

15:28.320 --> 15:34.720
female attractive appearance that you can only use if you're wearing, like, a black trench coat

15:34.720 --> 15:37.120
and have a- and have a few swords at home.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
Like, I think- I think-

15:39.120 --> 15:42.560
If you- if you wear a fedora actively, then that's-

15:42.560 --> 15:43.280
Right.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.240
On purpose.

15:44.240 --> 15:44.740
Yeah.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.200
If some- if someone's ever said,

15:47.200 --> 15:52.880
hey, I can see your vest bulge underneath your black trench coat, then- then-

15:52.880 --> 15:54.960
then you can probably use words like comely.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.880
Are those new steampunk goggles?

15:58.160 --> 15:58.960
Those are lovely.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.160
Those are divine.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.040
I had them polished just for you, Christine.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.520
Please leave your boyfriend.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.760
Please go to Subway with me.

16:09.760 --> 16:14.560
Who is- who is- who are these people who are complimenting people on the street?

16:14.560 --> 16:16.320
It's me.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.560
Hey, it's handsome stuff.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.840
I like what- what all you got there.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.280
Hey, handsome stuff, you wanna buy me a bus ticket?

16:28.160 --> 16:29.440
I like here what you're working with.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.800
There, text.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.520
Uh, I- yeah, I think handsome could be misconstrued.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.760
It just always seems like it's used as a euphemism.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.480
Like, I've never heard someone say it in a convincing way.

16:42.480 --> 16:47.440
I've never heard- nobody's ever called me handsome without the words little guy following it.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.680
And- and usually- usually in the interrogative, who's my handsome little guy?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.480
Question mark.

16:54.480 --> 16:59.040
I- I've- I've never had it handsome unless it was followed by in context.

16:59.040 --> 16:59.440
Which I-

17:01.360 --> 17:03.760
Mine's usually followed with comparatively.

17:03.760 --> 17:04.080
Yeah.

17:04.080 --> 17:04.320
Yeah.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.480
In the right light.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.240
Um, I guess.

17:08.880 --> 17:09.360
I guess.

17:10.160 --> 17:10.560
For you.

17:10.560 --> 17:18.000
Um, there- yeah, I- I think though I would steer away- I would steer clear of handsome.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.640
I'm not sure that's gonna- I'm not sure you're gonna win that particularly.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.200
It won't play.

17:22.240 --> 17:22.480
Yeah.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.520
That ball don't got legs.

17:24.080 --> 17:24.800
It don't track.

17:25.520 --> 17:29.680
Uh, hey, I'm looking to buy a diamond engagement ring.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.640
Uh, I would like to get one with a diamond close to one carat,

17:35.680 --> 17:39.680
but a good one that size is currently out of my price range.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.360
You have any tips on getting a better price?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.600
Or what channels I should go through to get a better deal?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.760
That's from Engaged in Edmonton.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.000
Travis, would you choose these questions?

17:48.000 --> 17:48.880
What the fuck?

17:49.920 --> 17:52.640
Like, what- what about me and Griffin makes you think,

17:52.640 --> 17:55.040
I bet those guys got a good line on a diamond.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.800
Well, I figured that with your extensive trading in blood diamonds,

17:58.800 --> 18:00.640
you'd be able to like hook him up with something.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.120
Steal- I guess theft?

18:03.120 --> 18:06.320
What the fuck do you- I want the nice thing, but I don't want to pay money to do it.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.040
You mine it out of the ground and you fucking- you kill.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.560
You kill and take.

18:10.560 --> 18:15.200
You would like- yeah, you would like to get one with close to one carat,

18:15.200 --> 18:16.560
but you can't afford that.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.520
Well, let me help you.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.400
You don't- don't get that big.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.200
Get a smaller one?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.080
Maybe go smaller.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.320
Maybe you're the real prize.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.480
All I know- do you have anything about that?

18:26.480 --> 18:30.880
I just know like about- I know a little bit about like purchasing things.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.560
I know how to acquire things with money.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.280
So in that sense, I guess I have- I guess I have a little bit of expertise here.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.600
If you don't have the money for the thing, then you can't get the thing.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.800
That's the problem with it.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.040
Unless you get an apprenticeship at the jeweler.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.120
That's good.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.560
Are you talking about a heist?

18:47.520 --> 18:49.520
No, I was talking about like working for it.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.120
No, but let's go with heist.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.280
Okay, diamond- diamond heist.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.360
Now you're speaking our language.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.640
Can you- can you do like a coal?

18:58.640 --> 18:59.440
You press it down?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.680
Like Superman?

19:01.680 --> 19:04.720
No, if you- is that a power that Superman has?

19:04.720 --> 19:06.000
He did it once or twice.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.120
That seems kind of fucked up.

19:08.000 --> 19:08.800
Yeah, doesn't it?

19:10.160 --> 19:12.640
Okay, there's a pawn shop, right?

19:12.640 --> 19:13.360
You can do that?

19:14.560 --> 19:15.920
That's a thing, right?

19:15.920 --> 19:16.320
Oh, you mean like-

19:16.320 --> 19:17.840
You can go on pawn stars.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.560
Go on pawn stars and get one for cheap.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.800
Go on storage wars.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.720
Hope you find one in a storage unit.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.000
That could take a while, but you know, give it a shot.

19:30.000 --> 19:36.080
Um, anybody else, when they hear pawn stars, they think that it just sounds like a New Orleans

19:36.080 --> 19:37.680
southern gentleman saying porn stars?

19:38.480 --> 19:39.680
Pawn stars!

19:41.680 --> 19:43.600
Uh, this is- this isn't very good.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.040
Nah, that's not very good, goof.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.320
Kind of- kind of climaxed early, but I thought it was okay.

19:49.520 --> 19:55.120
Um, I mean, girls- you know, girls don't really care about the size of diamonds.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.200
If you're going with the size and you don't care about the clarity, you can get- you can

19:59.200 --> 20:00.400
get cheaper.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.880
Oh, that sounded good, Travis.

20:02.880 --> 20:03.680
That sounded like a real thing.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.640
You sound like a big, fat, muddy-ass diamond.

20:07.360 --> 20:12.080
Yeah, if you're all right with some imperfections in the diamond, then you can get it for a

20:12.080 --> 20:12.640
lot cheaper.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.080
I got you this ring pop.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.840
It's 450 carats.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.360
You're talking about just the raunchiest, merriliest-

20:19.360 --> 20:22.240
The nastiest, gnarliest, most-

20:22.240 --> 20:24.240
I want a diamond with a fly in the middle.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.520
Excuse me, waiter.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.480
I want a diamond that I can use to clone dinosaurs.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.320
You idiot.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.200
You're so dumb.

20:41.760 --> 20:42.160
I want a-

20:42.160 --> 20:43.120
You're stupid.

20:44.800 --> 20:45.840
That doesn't make sense.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.640
You guys are dumb.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.560
You guys are both stupid.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.440
This guy's dumb.

20:49.440 --> 20:55.520
Oh, I want a diamond the size of a can of soup, but I only have this many.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.240
How many big-

20:56.240 --> 20:58.080
How big a diamond for this many, please?

21:00.160 --> 21:00.560
None.

21:00.560 --> 21:04.160
I wish he'd give us some hard numbers, though, because I bet I could get him a-

21:04.160 --> 21:05.360
I bet I could give him a better deal.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.840
You see that Priceline Negotiator?

21:07.840 --> 21:09.680
Maybe he could help you out.

21:09.680 --> 21:10.640
He's not a real man.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.840
Yeah, Priceline Negotiator.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.040
You go to their site, go to priceline.com, say, I'm not going to pay a lot for this diamond.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.920
Yeah, and then you, uh, you can pay any price you want.

21:19.920 --> 21:20.160
I'm-

21:20.160 --> 21:21.040
Here's what you do.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.560
You call William Shatner.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.240
You tell him you need a diamond real bad.

21:24.240 --> 21:29.600
Say, I'm flying from Edmonton to Engagement Town, and I need a hotel for life.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.480
That'll probably work out.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.120
This is dumb.

21:34.160 --> 21:34.640
You're dumb.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.720
We don't know anything about this.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.560
Why do you ask us this?

21:39.200 --> 21:40.240
Ask somebody better.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.800
Maybe a different setting?

21:42.800 --> 21:44.480
Did you think about a crown setting?

21:45.520 --> 21:46.400
Maybe a different setting.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.480
Hey, what about, what about white gold?

21:48.480 --> 21:50.240
Uh, so I guess in closing, sorry.

21:50.880 --> 21:55.520
I guess in closing, ask, ask, ask somebody else better.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.080
Or ask us-

21:56.080 --> 21:57.120
Ask somebody better than us.

21:57.120 --> 22:02.000
You either ask us about, like, farting in public, or you ask the diamond podcast,

22:02.000 --> 22:08.400
you ask Jared.com about diamonds, because that's Jared's focal point.

22:09.120 --> 22:13.120
Sometimes the best advice we can give is to tell someone that we're not their best.

22:13.120 --> 22:17.440
Yeah, we're like Macy's in Miracle on 34th Street.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.720
It's actually, it's honestly so rare that we're able to make that distinction.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.720
I feel like we just really lean into it when it happens.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.520
Griffin.

22:25.520 --> 22:25.920
How about a-

22:25.920 --> 22:28.240
Give me somebody, give me somebody we can help.

22:28.240 --> 22:31.040
Okay, here's a, here's a good one.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.200
This one was also sent in by Lisa Holofield.

22:33.200 --> 22:33.920
Thank you, Lisa.

22:33.920 --> 22:38.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ambie, who asks, I am trying to learn boxing.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.200
The basic problem is, when a punch is thrown at me, I close my eyes and don't block.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.600
Please tell me drills to do, because I really want to get over.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.240
It's probably fear, because of which I close my eyes.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.280
Wow.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.320
So he's got one, he punches really good.

22:58.960 --> 22:59.920
Right, the punches are on point.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.280
His punches are like trains with fists on the end of them.

23:03.280 --> 23:08.560
One prob though, one hang up though, is that when he gets punched, he says,

23:08.560 --> 23:11.440
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.920
The way he describes it in the question though,

23:13.920 --> 23:16.480
makes it sound like he's really casual about it, because he doesn't block.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.520
He's not ducking away.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.560
He just closes his eyes, like, and just stands there.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.920
If you can't see the fist, then they can't punch you with them or something.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.320
Maybe this should be his thing, right?

23:26.320 --> 23:28.640
Like you, I don't know, man.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.840
I just kept swinging and he would just close his eyes and take it.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.320
After like three or four, I felt bad.

23:34.880 --> 23:35.920
I was intimidated.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.440
I felt bad for him.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.680
What is he doing in there, the little crazy little dude?

23:39.680 --> 23:42.800
I kept putting his hands up for him and he would just drop them back down.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.400
He looked like he was thinking really hard about how to punch me back.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.280
And that kind of cerebral maneuvers, it's intimidating.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.320
He had a strategy.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.840
He's all up in my head, man.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.280
Can you be a good boxer and take, and not, I mean,

23:55.280 --> 23:57.360
maybe he's trying to learn how to take punches.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.640
You get, so the solution is just have somebody punch you a lot

24:01.280 --> 24:02.080
until you're not afraid.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.680
It's immersion therapy.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.560
Oh, you don't want to fight against callous face Jones.

24:06.560 --> 24:11.120
Yeah, that's the, that's the, that's the, a lot of, a lot of people

24:11.120 --> 24:13.200
don't realize that that's how you become a great boxer.

24:13.200 --> 24:19.600
If you can arc it so that you become immune to punching before you die.

24:19.600 --> 24:24.160
Yeah, it kills you because they hit some punch something in your brain and break it.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.640
The trick is to take enough punches so that you're not scared of punches anymore,

24:30.640 --> 24:33.680
but not too many punches so that you forget how to eat.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.920
So that you forget how to chew and swallow food.

24:37.920 --> 24:42.000
That's why, that's why Rocky drinks eggs because he forgot how to eat.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.520
I just don't go on it.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.560
I took too many punches.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.320
I don't know how to eat to chew to chew.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.720
That's why I sound like I do when I talk.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.400
Hey, hey, yo Ziggy.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.280
That was sliced alone.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.680
That was good.

24:55.680 --> 24:56.160
I thought.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.840
Hey guys, I want to take a bunches.

24:58.880 --> 24:59.840
Hey boo boo.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.360
Hey boo boo, I'm a boxer.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.040
I think I'm gonna close my eyes.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.280
I am the law.

25:09.040 --> 25:09.840
Pretty good impressions.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.000
The important thing is not getting punched.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.520
I think maybe if you punch them more.

25:16.400 --> 25:20.800
What if you're, if they're too busy blocking your flurry of punches,

25:20.800 --> 25:22.240
they're not gonna have time to punch you.

25:22.240 --> 25:22.720
That's great.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.600
They're gonna be Tucker.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.680
You're just one big stupid glass cannon.

25:27.360 --> 25:31.520
I would like to take this guy's story and turn it into like the next like Rudy.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.240
Mm-hmm.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.960
We're like the guy goes into the coach and he's like,

25:34.960 --> 25:37.120
I want to be the best boxer.

25:37.120 --> 25:37.760
Train me.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.520
And the coach is like, I see something in you.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.400
Let's do this.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.600
And they get in the ring.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.800
And the guy throws the punches.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.480
The coach is like, that was a great punch.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.280
Okay, now block.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.160
Coaches like lays them out in the first punch.

25:48.160 --> 25:48.640
Yeah.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.440
It's like, hey, hey kid, you shouldn't box anymore.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.200
And John Favreau comes in the next day.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.400
He's like, hey, Rudy's dead.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.480
Yeah, he's dead.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.360
He punched him.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.600
He punched him a bunch and he didn't block it.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.320
Closed his eyes.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.520
So at least he didn't see his death.

26:03.360 --> 26:03.760
He died.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.120
So that was merciful, I guess.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.520
It's going to be a closed casket because he got, he did get pretty-

26:07.520 --> 26:08.880
Whoa, whoa.

26:08.880 --> 26:11.040
You punched the front of his face or the back of it.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.080
Come on, coach.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.920
Let me be a boxer.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.520
I'll do anything to be a pro boxer.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.160
Will you block?

26:16.160 --> 26:16.640
I will not do that.

26:16.640 --> 26:17.840
I will not do this one thing.

26:18.400 --> 26:22.160
The one thing I will not do is block or open my eyes.

26:22.960 --> 26:23.680
Do you dodge?

26:23.680 --> 26:27.040
Well, with my eyes closed, it is hard to see which way to dodge.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.200
Can we agree to that?

26:29.200 --> 26:32.240
Like if you're going to get punched, like you probably don't want your eyes open.

26:32.240 --> 26:35.200
Because he was there the whole time.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.000
They call him cornea Jones.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.400
He punches him right in their open eyeball.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.840
Actually, that's what happens in some pro fights is a person will get punched in their open eye.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.920
And then you go, ow, ow, ow, wait, wait, wait.

26:49.920 --> 26:50.640
And they have to wait.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.280
Time out.

26:51.280 --> 26:51.760
Time out.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.440
It's the gentleman's role of boxing.

26:53.440 --> 26:57.760
Do you know when they cut people in the corners?

26:57.760 --> 26:59.280
What they're doing is cutting their eyelids off.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.880
So they have to keep their eyes open.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.160
A lot of people don't know that.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.040
Why would they do that?

27:03.040 --> 27:03.920
It's a harsh world.

27:05.040 --> 27:05.920
It is a harsh world.

27:05.920 --> 27:10.080
They also have that thing where they run the dry erase marker over their face to get rid

27:10.080 --> 27:11.440
of some of the blood that's on there.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.680
And then they make them smell like a bucket full of spit.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.480
Like smell the spit.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.280
I don't know.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.160
Seems mean.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.680
They fluff a little bit.

27:21.040 --> 27:21.600
Just a little bit.

27:21.600 --> 27:27.520
Hey, I have three best friends in my city.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.560
They're all guys.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.520
I'm a woman.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.080
One of these guys is also my boyfriend.

27:32.080 --> 27:37.680
My question is, is it normal and expected that they're all closer to each other than

27:37.680 --> 27:39.200
they are to me?

27:39.200 --> 27:43.200
I have girlfriends that I can talk to and spend time with independently of my other

27:43.200 --> 27:43.920
boyfriend.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.720
So it's not as if I have nowhere to go for advice and venting.

27:46.720 --> 27:53.280
But the fact that you just asked us a question to the evidencing to that to the contrary,

27:53.280 --> 27:55.200
but we'll continue forward.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.840
I just wish I could go to my besties for that.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.200
What do you think?

27:59.920 --> 28:02.880
Am I expecting too much from my opposite sex friendships?

28:02.880 --> 28:03.920
That's from second favorite.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.480
Well, I got to think about this for a second.

28:09.520 --> 28:14.320
I mean, I have my harsh reality opinion of it.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.680
No, really?

28:15.680 --> 28:16.400
I know.

28:16.400 --> 28:22.240
But I feel like I mean, just just based on these facts without any other details, I feel

28:22.240 --> 28:27.040
like there's a certain thing that happens, like where if your friends are friends with

28:27.040 --> 28:31.280
your boyfriend, there's a certain amount that they probably have of just wanting to stay

28:31.280 --> 28:34.080
out of tricky relationship stuff all together.

28:34.880 --> 28:41.440
Yeah, because they're his guy friends, you know, so it's a minefield for them.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.920
Minefield for them.

28:43.920 --> 28:50.240
I know that it rubs some people the wrong way when you when you assign any sort of gender

28:50.240 --> 28:51.760
attributes, and I'm not doing that.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.040
We did do that earlier in the episode with the word handsome.

28:55.040 --> 28:55.680
Uh huh.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.520
Yes, that is that was different.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.840
So we only get one pass per.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.440
Candace Bergen is a handsome.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.400
I was trying to think of her earlier.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.240
I try to think of her often, but specifically Murphy Brown.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
A handsome woman.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.440
Is that a talented, award winning journalist?

29:14.720 --> 29:18.720
Once you I think guys and girls can be friends with each other, and I think.

29:18.720 --> 29:23.920
Sure, I don't think that's a problem, but I think once you decided you're going to date

29:23.920 --> 29:26.800
one of them, you're going to date a guy, you have to.

29:28.320 --> 29:33.520
Except that you are changing the dynamic, and part of that is when you have a problem

29:33.520 --> 29:40.560
with the guy, you can't like it's not going to be as cool for you to go to his friends

29:40.560 --> 29:41.440
to complain about it.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.080
It's just not a safe split.

29:44.080 --> 29:47.600
It's not a safe space anymore for for relationship stuff.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.840
I don't mean everything, but I think of it specific to him.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.160
Specific to your boyfriend.

29:54.160 --> 30:01.280
I think you gotta go to other girls for that, and I think that even even in the most like

30:01.280 --> 30:07.360
chaste, purely friendship situation, whenever you enter into a relationship, friendships

30:07.360 --> 30:11.200
with the opposite sex become kind of just a little.

30:12.800 --> 30:17.360
You know, a little weirder in general, I think on both sides because of this idea of like

30:17.360 --> 30:19.600
I don't want to seem improper.

30:19.600 --> 30:24.000
It just for some reason for me, it always got weird every time I've ever dated someone

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
and also been friends with, you know, and hung out with women and always just felt kind

30:28.000 --> 30:28.720
of weird.

30:28.720 --> 30:35.840
Yeah, you know, it really it and it doesn't have to do with the fact that of genders.

30:35.840 --> 30:40.880
It has everything to do with the fact that they are friends with your with your boyfriend.

30:40.880 --> 30:41.520
So they're not.

30:41.520 --> 30:42.960
They can't be impartial.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.680
They have loyalty to both of you.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.360
It doesn't make them a good sounding board.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.680
I mean, even if you want to be friends with other guys, that's fine.

30:49.680 --> 30:54.240
Just it can't be guys that are also friends, you know, super close to your boyfriend because

30:54.240 --> 31:00.640
they can't be objective and they're going to feel weird about about, you know, hearing

31:00.640 --> 31:02.640
these complaints and not being able to do anything about it.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.520
Yeah, that wasn't a very funny answer.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.520
I just think you got it.

31:10.640 --> 31:15.840
I don't think it's sexist to say that every lady should have her shark pack and every

31:15.840 --> 31:18.400
dude should have his his his bro pack.

31:18.400 --> 31:18.640
Right.

31:18.640 --> 31:26.720
I is that weird that sometimes you just seek out the the company even briefly of of one

31:26.720 --> 31:27.220
gender?

31:28.400 --> 31:29.120
I mean, I do that.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.800
And like my girlfriend does that.

31:30.800 --> 31:34.720
And all of my friends here in Austin have like there's ladies nighttime and now there's

31:34.720 --> 31:34.960
dudes.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.440
Yeah.

31:35.440 --> 31:40.000
And is that I don't think I think that's completely normal.

31:40.000 --> 31:46.560
I think that that's I think that that is is healthy to have, you know, like just I'm not

31:46.560 --> 31:49.520
saying like you can't be friends with the opposite gender, but every so often you want

31:49.520 --> 31:51.680
to be like, hey, let's just like bro out, you know?

31:51.680 --> 31:52.080
Yeah.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.680
Or let's have a feeding frenzy.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.120
Ladies just want to feed, you know?

31:56.080 --> 31:56.320
Yeah.

31:56.320 --> 31:59.440
They try to unhinge your jaws and just eat men whole.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.920
I think you might be misinterpreting it.

32:01.920 --> 32:07.120
I don't think it's that they are closer to each other than they are to you, because I

32:07.120 --> 32:11.760
would fucking hope that your boyfriend's closer to you than he is to his bros.

32:11.760 --> 32:20.400
But but I just think that it's sometimes they seek the solace of yeah, of gentlemen.

32:20.400 --> 32:25.760
I it is hard, though, and I and I know that you would like to be able to I know you'd

32:25.760 --> 32:30.880
like to be able to talk to, you know, your your other dude friends about it, but you

32:30.880 --> 32:32.880
just have to accept that goes with the territory.

32:32.880 --> 32:38.080
Once you start dating somebody and put that into the dynamic, you can't just turn that

32:38.080 --> 32:41.280
off because you'd like their their advice.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.920
It's it's a different it's a different world now.

32:43.920 --> 32:48.800
And I think that you also it's a sticky situation because we've also gotten questions

32:48.800 --> 32:52.640
from the other side where women have complained that they're, quote, just one of the guys.

32:53.600 --> 32:58.000
You know, and like the fact that they still see you as a woman and don't include you in

32:58.000 --> 33:00.320
their bro time is not necessarily a bad thing.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.240
Yeah, it's not as bad as saying bros a lot, which we happen to be doing.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.080
So we'll try to break that.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.320
So he wants to go hang out with his bros keys.

33:10.320 --> 33:15.680
Yeah, you know, if you want to go and out and yeah, is there a better word for men?

33:15.680 --> 33:20.000
Friends like dude pals, dude pals.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.040
OK, dude buddies, dude buddies, air buddies.

33:23.040 --> 33:27.200
But what about just buds with a Z and you say with the Z and that's how you know that

33:27.200 --> 33:28.560
it's in reference to a man.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.160
That's pretty much how I say it about drugs, though.

33:32.160 --> 33:39.360
Gentlemen callers can our podcast now just be called three buds, but buds and out in

33:39.360 --> 33:40.080
my newspaper.

33:40.080 --> 33:44.560
There was a story about a guy who did a Mario mural for his kid and they were quoting him

33:44.560 --> 33:49.120
about the about the the the Super Mario Brothers game.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.520
He said, I used to love that when I was a kid.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.960
Mario and Luigi were buddies.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.000
No, they weren't.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.880
That's no, that's no, that's adorable, though.

33:58.880 --> 34:04.320
When it was actually I would like to point out that they're never in the same place at

34:04.320 --> 34:05.360
the same time.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.280
Yeah, you don't even know that they enjoyed each other's company.

34:07.280 --> 34:11.040
Hey, adults, when you say buddies, it's adorable.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.080
Keep it up.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.120
Keep it up.

34:13.120 --> 34:13.840
You've earned it.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.120
You went without dying for lots of years.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.440
So you have earned the right to say buddies.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.760
Griffin, you know what I've earned the right to do?

34:22.320 --> 34:24.960
Be buddies with money.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.600
Money, buddy, buddy, money, buddies.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.200
And now here's a segment.

34:29.200 --> 34:29.920
Money Buddies.

34:45.760 --> 34:53.440
We are we are launching a journey today, an epic poem that is really a partnership between

34:53.440 --> 35:04.000
us and our new friend, Eric Noreen, and his project, his his product, his fucking revolutionary

35:04.560 --> 35:08.240
like revolution or change your life, change your life.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.600
It's called Stack.

35:09.600 --> 35:13.920
Prepare to kick yourself in your own ass for being so stupid for not coming up with this

35:13.920 --> 35:14.240
first.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.200
You're going to get ready to be an idiot because you did not.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.640
You've been an idiot your whole life.

35:18.640 --> 35:19.440
You didn't even know it.

35:19.440 --> 35:22.560
You I want you guys to know that I really feel like you're talking directly to me.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.200
You are a dumb shithead for not thinking of this product.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.400
You stupid asshole.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.560
Stack is not helping this.

35:29.360 --> 35:29.840
It is.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.040
It is specially created.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.360
It's hard to describe the shape.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.320
You should probably just go to stacksoap.com and you'll see.

35:38.320 --> 35:42.080
But it's a it's created in such a way with that sort of divot.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.760
It's it's pringular.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.440
I would say it's pringular.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.840
It's got a pringular design to divot at the top.

35:47.840 --> 35:53.600
You you wash yourself with the stack soap and then you wear it down to the point that

35:53.600 --> 35:59.040
it fits perfectly into your next bar of stack soap.

35:59.760 --> 36:05.600
What the stack soap the divot has the word stack in it and like letters that stick out

36:05.600 --> 36:10.640
so that it just it adheres to the wet sliver of soap that you have remaining and it forms

36:10.640 --> 36:16.000
a new bar of soap that you whittle down to another sliver and fit into the next thing

36:16.000 --> 36:17.440
of stack soap.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.560
I feel so stupid.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.000
You dumb piece of shit.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.080
Never have a stack.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.840
Never have a soap sliver again.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.080
If you here's the thing, though, we're trying to get this made.

36:26.080 --> 36:30.160
He's trying to get a a copper mold.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.080
That's one of the last last components he needs.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.680
But it's going to cost a little cheddar.

36:33.680 --> 36:34.960
It's going to cost nine grand.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.440
But we're all going to team up to get it made.

36:37.440 --> 36:43.360
So go to go to stacksoap.com and you will find a Kickstarter.

36:43.360 --> 36:48.800
If you get on board, the first thousand people can pledge what they want and they're going

36:48.800 --> 36:52.000
to get six bars of stack soap, whatever they think is fair.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.640
And and that includes shipping.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.440
So don't you know, don't go on just just pledge a buck.

36:57.440 --> 37:02.480
But the first thousand people that do that are going to be able to to pledge what they

37:02.480 --> 37:04.640
want for a bar of stack.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.120
So let's see.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.880
Let's get six bars, six bars.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.640
Let's get on the offensive right now.

37:08.640 --> 37:09.200
Right.

37:09.200 --> 37:14.400
If you're using body wash, you are just moving your funk around, right?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.680
You're just moving the funk around.

37:15.680 --> 37:21.040
If you don't have a solid lie based product, then you are as dumb as Travis is.

37:21.040 --> 37:28.400
Yeah, you've got to have a stack, a physical, tangible, solid, not a plasma, a solid ass

37:28.400 --> 37:29.920
piece of soapy matter.

37:29.920 --> 37:35.280
No matter how handsome you are, if you're not using soap, you're an idiot.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.480
You're a child.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.440
You're a dirty child.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.280
You're a dirty child, idiot child.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.280
You're like an idiot, dirt child.

37:41.280 --> 37:46.560
This is the infinite soap bar cycle and you can get on board with it right now.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.320
Go.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.000
This is like ground level.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.200
Like you can get in on the first floor of this and go to stacksoap.com right now.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.320
We're going to be following this.

37:56.320 --> 38:01.360
This is going to be an effort between it's a it's a co production of my brother, my brother

38:01.360 --> 38:04.000
and me and the maximum fun network.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.920
February and a little bit of March is get yourself clean month with stack soap.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.280
We don't have a jingle at this exact moment, Griffin.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.000
I want to make it.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.320
This is this is the longest relationship we've ever had with a promotional partner.

38:16.320 --> 38:20.720
So when I turn it out, I want it to be like a like a Coca-Cola theme song.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.680
You know, Coca-Cola, drink it all day and all night.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.360
You remember that one?

38:25.360 --> 38:27.840
That little ditty from the 40s.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.680
They played it on the radio serials.

38:29.680 --> 38:34.640
Anyway, when I turn this shit out, I want it to be like Space Jam 2.

38:34.640 --> 38:35.200
You know what I mean?

38:35.200 --> 38:35.680
Yeah.

38:35.680 --> 38:35.920
Yeah.

38:35.920 --> 38:36.400
Epic.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.040
I want it.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.520
I want it to be like I want it to be in the Grammys.

38:39.520 --> 38:42.560
I like you getting garage band and just lay down some track.

38:43.120 --> 38:48.480
I've been laying down some loops and I've got a few Samba beats that I like.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.080
So we'll see.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.120
We'll see what turns up.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.880
But I promise Stack Soap the best jingle that they've ever heard.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.640
So go to stacksoap.com and while you're getting clean with your new

38:58.640 --> 39:03.360
Stack Soap, you can listen to another great podcast on the Maximum Fun Network,

39:03.360 --> 39:06.240
which you will hear about right now.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.400
Hello there, my name is Graham Clark.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.600
And I'm Dave Shumka.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.440
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.840
This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to it in your pod.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.280
What's that about, you ask?

39:23.280 --> 39:24.640
Well, who are you to ask?

39:24.640 --> 39:25.840
Who do you think you are?

39:25.840 --> 39:27.760
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

39:27.760 --> 39:32.160
We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.800
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.160
Sometimes they're Canadian.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.360
Sometimes they're not.

39:37.360 --> 39:38.720
Sometimes they're a ghost.

39:38.720 --> 39:42.000
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.040
Plus, we're Canadian.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.800
So you get a tax break.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.760
You can find us on iTunes or online at MaximumFun.org.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.080
Let's come back with a Yahoo answer.

39:56.080 --> 39:59.040
This one was, Jesus, this one was sent in by Lisa Holofield, too.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.640
Thank you so much, Lisa.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.080
Crushin' it, crushin' it, fan of the year.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.440
Can she just have some money?

40:04.320 --> 40:04.820
Yep.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.320
Someone give her some money.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.240
This was asked by Brian, who asks,

40:10.240 --> 40:13.760
is it illegal for me to upload a picture of me with a sword to Facebook?

40:16.320 --> 40:20.640
I want my default pic to be one of me with the sword I got in eighth grade.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.120
If I do not look threatening, is this illegal?

40:23.120 --> 40:25.280
Any ins and outs I need to be aware of?

40:25.280 --> 40:27.120
P.S. I will look civilized.

40:30.400 --> 40:35.680
Call Guinness, because it's the first time a dude has ever looked civilized with a sword.

40:35.680 --> 40:36.560
It's me.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.080
I'm wearing a frock, and this is my gentleman's foil.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.600
How civil.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.880
I'm actually, I'm looking at the Facebook rules right now about posting pictures,

40:46.880 --> 40:50.240
and it says to do it, you have to have a really intense look on your face

40:50.240 --> 40:53.680
and be holding the sword somewhere down around your crotch.

40:53.680 --> 40:57.920
You have to have photoshopped fire, like Dragon Ball Z fire,

40:57.920 --> 41:00.320
on the sword and possibly in your eyes.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.280
And it has to say something above it, like, Destiny.

41:04.240 --> 41:07.360
And you have to make sure that you tastefully trimmed your scraggly beard.

41:08.720 --> 41:12.320
If somebody could photoshop us, pictures of us like that, I will make it my face.

41:12.320 --> 41:15.520
I want nothing but Dragon Ball Z photoshops of us.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.800
There's fire and swords, laser beams, tails.

41:20.800 --> 41:24.400
Maybe he meant Sybilized, which is to look like Sybil Shepherd.

41:25.600 --> 41:32.720
I like the idea of Sybilized better, like us in full 1930s military regalia

41:32.720 --> 41:35.920
with an epée in one hand and a tea sandwich in the other.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.600
Very fancy.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.400
Like a gentleman with a sword.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.560
Who gave you one in eighth grade?

41:42.560 --> 41:43.520
Who did that to you?

41:44.240 --> 41:45.520
Who did that to you?

41:45.520 --> 41:46.880
You're too young for that.

41:46.880 --> 41:47.440
You're too little.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.400
You're just a baby.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.680
Unless it was his sensei.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.360
Yeah, his sword sensei.

41:51.360 --> 41:55.600
Oh, you're saying once he had learned all the strokes and all the stabs.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.000
What are the cuts?

41:58.000 --> 41:58.560
Cut one.

42:00.000 --> 42:00.640
Left stab.

42:00.640 --> 42:01.520
Leftward cut.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.080
We have it on this show.

42:04.080 --> 42:08.640
We take a pretty hard line against people putting things on their Facebook that aren't them,

42:08.640 --> 42:13.440
such as their dogs and their babies and their dead grandmothers.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.720
That's the one that's killing me, guys.

42:14.720 --> 42:15.520
You gotta stop.

42:15.520 --> 42:19.120
Stop, but I think that if you are the sort of dude

42:19.120 --> 42:22.480
that would put a picture of you with a sword on Facebook,

42:22.480 --> 42:23.760
that's probably pretty good.

42:23.760 --> 42:24.320
Oh, God.

42:24.880 --> 42:25.760
I swear to God.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.160
I thought you said sword of dude.

42:28.160 --> 42:31.920
Like the sword of dude.

42:31.920 --> 42:35.040
I had no idea what it meant.

42:35.040 --> 42:35.520
I don't know.

42:35.520 --> 42:36.080
It's awesome.

42:37.520 --> 42:40.000
Behold the sword of dude.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.680
No, you're the sword of dude.

42:43.680 --> 42:47.920
I'm more interested in this person thinking he's gonna get in trouble

42:47.920 --> 42:51.360
for uploading a picture of him with a sword to Facebook

42:51.360 --> 42:52.560
and then somebody being like,

42:53.520 --> 42:54.880
is he fucking threatening me?

42:56.080 --> 42:57.760
Whoa, oh, God.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.280
In the picture, I am covered in blood.

42:59.280 --> 42:59.680
Oh, God.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.040
I was looking at my newsfeed.

43:01.040 --> 43:05.040
I saw a picture of you with a Final Fantasy replica sword,

43:05.040 --> 43:07.040
and I got spooked because I thought you were-

43:07.040 --> 43:08.400
Put down that buster sword.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.120
Hey, Skylar Zuckerberg.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.600
You knew, you knew this call was coming.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.760
You fucked up.

43:15.760 --> 43:16.560
What is that?

43:16.560 --> 43:17.520
A katana-naka?

43:19.280 --> 43:20.000
Put that down.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.160
I respect your people.

43:22.160 --> 43:23.760
I respect your traditions.

43:24.240 --> 43:27.200
You can't put a sword on my book.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.280
I got a call from Spider-Man.

43:29.280 --> 43:32.640
He said, I got spooked when I loaded my newsfeed.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.120
I saw a picture of his katana.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.200
I saw his epi, and I said, nope.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.360
I closed the window because I was afraid.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.080
Griffin, you have to take me inside the bit

43:42.080 --> 43:44.560
and tell me what Spider-Man is friends with Skylar.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.600
Spider-Man.

43:45.600 --> 43:49.120
Spider-Man is the guy who was his friend in the movie.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.640
Oh, I got you.

43:52.640 --> 43:54.000
Spider-Man was his best bud.

43:54.960 --> 43:57.520
I like to believe that all films share continuity.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.240
I know you guys, you've heard about me.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.480
Shortly after founding Facebook and suing for rights,

44:02.480 --> 44:04.640
he was bitten by a spider and became Spider-Man.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.360
Oh, I get it.

44:05.360 --> 44:09.600
So that's what that's what spurned him to fight injustice.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.160
He was like, that's it.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.200
I'm going to fight villains from now on.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.640
That's why he's ultimate Spider-Man,

44:14.640 --> 44:15.760
because he's rich as fuck.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.560
So when he said, you better lawyer up

44:18.560 --> 44:19.600
because I'm coming after you,

44:19.600 --> 44:22.240
what he meant was time to start ducking webs.

44:22.240 --> 44:22.400
Yeah.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.480
Because I got spiders, spider powers in here.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.000
Spider blood pumping through my veins,

44:28.720 --> 44:30.000
which doesn't sound that intimidating

44:30.000 --> 44:30.880
when you say it like that.

44:30.880 --> 44:31.360
No.

44:31.360 --> 44:32.880
You know what is intimidating?

44:32.880 --> 44:33.200
What?

44:33.200 --> 44:35.680
A man with a sword.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.600
That's a real power move.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.800
Spider-Man with a sword.

44:40.240 --> 44:44.000
Do you, do you use Facebook for business or just person?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
No, it's pretty much just personal stuff.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.360
I haven't got a lot of business traffic through there.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.120
You should see my LinkedIn page.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.600
It's, there's a lot of,

44:53.600 --> 44:55.520
I would say civilized sword picks in there.

44:56.480 --> 44:56.880
It's a-

44:56.880 --> 44:58.320
I'm available for parties.

44:58.320 --> 44:58.720
Yeah.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.280
Yeah.

44:59.280 --> 45:03.680
I'll spend nunchukus around.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.920
I got a whole bo staff routine worked out.

45:05.920 --> 45:06.800
It's pretty sick.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.240
Now I will be honest.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.720
I do not know much about venture capital,

45:11.280 --> 45:15.120
but I do have, I own many swords.

45:15.120 --> 45:15.360
So-

45:15.360 --> 45:15.920
I'm highly motivated.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.160
Here's a reference letter from my sensei.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.600
I used to own swords, everybody.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.480
I still have swords.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.520
There's nothing wrong with that.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.920
I'm just not going to like take Facebook.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.880
It's like, I mean, there's lots of,

45:28.880 --> 45:30.640
okay, I have a Crock-Pot,

45:30.640 --> 45:36.000
but if my Facebook picture is me holding a Crock-Pot above my head,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.320
like, yes, look at it.

45:38.320 --> 45:38.960
This is me.

45:39.840 --> 45:42.320
This is me in 2012 with a Crock-Pot.

45:42.320 --> 45:43.120
It's all about it.

45:43.920 --> 45:45.120
Like it doesn't matter.

45:45.120 --> 45:47.760
Like putting it in your Facebook picture is,

45:47.760 --> 45:48.720
it defines you.

45:48.720 --> 45:54.640
I mean, it is your, that is your outside message to the world, right?

45:54.640 --> 45:57.920
Well, I think if you're the kind of person that owns swords,

45:57.920 --> 46:01.280
then you're the kind of person that owns swords

46:01.280 --> 46:02.640
and there's no getting around that.

46:03.280 --> 46:05.920
You know, I have a sword and you guys want to know a secret?

46:07.440 --> 46:07.680
Not.

46:08.800 --> 46:09.600
Okay, great.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.800
This is really dicey, but I'm going to go with yes.

46:13.440 --> 46:14.720
I would never own a gun,

46:15.840 --> 46:19.280
but I see nothing wrong with keeping a sword by the bed for protection.

46:19.280 --> 46:20.240
Is this about to get,

46:21.360 --> 46:24.560
are we about to have an argument about the lethality of swords?

46:25.360 --> 46:25.920
No, no, no.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.000
I'm just saying like, I see nothing.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.840
I would like to envision a circumstance in which a criminal breaks into my house

46:31.840 --> 46:34.080
and has a gun and I draw a sword.

46:34.080 --> 46:39.040
You're telling me you could more easily stab a stranger with a giant sword

46:39.040 --> 46:40.880
than you could shoot a stranger.

46:40.880 --> 46:41.200
Like you severed their-

46:41.200 --> 46:42.560
No, I'm hoping that they're shocked.

46:42.560 --> 46:46.160
You stab them in the guts and then you see it.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.360
You see everything.

46:47.360 --> 46:50.720
You watch their intestines spill out across your Davenport.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.680
I can do a pretty deep lunge and I feel like it'll be really intimidating.

46:53.680 --> 46:57.520
That's, Travis, that's the most fucked up thing you've ever said out loud.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.440
I don't think that's true.

46:59.440 --> 47:03.360
Why don't you just keep a heavy rock next to the bed, fucking,

47:03.360 --> 47:05.680
you Lord of the Fly psychopath?

47:05.680 --> 47:06.960
I keep that under the couch.

47:08.320 --> 47:11.520
I just want to, I would just like to, I don't want my kids getting hurt,

47:11.520 --> 47:15.920
but I would like the feeling of crushing a man's skull with my bare hands.

47:16.480 --> 47:19.680
So I'll just keep a big rock next to my bed.

47:19.680 --> 47:24.720
Now the floor does open up into a sort of boo-boo box scorpion trap.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.960
But it's that, I mean, guns, yuck.

47:28.960 --> 47:29.520
Not for me.

47:30.080 --> 47:34.080
Not for me, but I do have a table that I lay them on

47:34.080 --> 47:38.320
and I saw a pinches off until they bleed out on my floor.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.880
Travis, you do have to do me a favor though.

47:40.880 --> 47:44.960
If you ever get into this imaginary situation, you gotta tube it for me.

47:45.680 --> 47:46.960
I gotta see what happens.

47:46.960 --> 47:52.560
I, seriously, I will make a whole Bravo series about that night you did that dumb thing.

47:54.880 --> 47:55.840
That's fair.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.800
Yeah, I, do you, okay.

48:00.080 --> 48:03.600
If you have the sword and they are like, they see you, okay?

48:04.240 --> 48:06.160
Describe that very next-

48:06.160 --> 48:08.080
This is how I picture it going.

48:08.080 --> 48:11.360
It's a very slow burn down to their gun

48:12.000 --> 48:14.480
and then they slow burn down to my sword.

48:14.480 --> 48:14.960
Okay.

48:14.960 --> 48:17.440
And then they drop the gun and just start backing away.

48:17.440 --> 48:17.760
Okay.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.280
That's how I hope it pans out.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.240
You have, why?

48:20.960 --> 48:21.280
Why would that happen?

48:21.280 --> 48:23.600
Because otherwise they shoot me in the face.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.640
Yeah, right.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.920
I mean, no, definitely.

48:25.920 --> 48:29.840
I'm pretty well versed in the actual thing that will definitely really happen.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.200
I'm kind of curious.

48:31.200 --> 48:34.640
I want you to take me sort of inside and why you think they're gonna see this.

48:34.640 --> 48:39.920
Well, I also have the true faith that like in an emergency situation,

48:39.920 --> 48:43.520
I would just immediately be able to have like the-

48:43.520 --> 48:45.920
The Dragon Ball Z fucking superpowers?

48:45.920 --> 48:49.120
Yeah, I just feel like Ninja would just come upon me

48:49.760 --> 48:50.800
and I would just move like a-

48:50.800 --> 48:52.960
No fucking bullets would come up on you.

48:52.960 --> 48:53.840
You would be dead.

48:55.280 --> 48:58.240
Your hope is that maybe the gunman will be superstitious

48:58.240 --> 49:00.960
about shooting mildly retarded Amish boys.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.440
I would much rather be shot than stabbed.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.240
I'm out of here.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.280
Now, I just want to point out though,

49:09.280 --> 49:12.080
if you were gonna get shot by someone robbing your house,

49:12.080 --> 49:14.160
wouldn't you want it to be sword in hand?

49:14.160 --> 49:14.400
No!

49:15.040 --> 49:16.240
You don't want to go out like that?

49:18.240 --> 49:20.800
Like a Ren Faire-ian actor?

49:20.800 --> 49:22.400
No, I don't want to go out like that.

49:22.400 --> 49:25.440
I want to go out like a man whose house got robbed with dignity

49:25.440 --> 49:27.280
while he was in his bedroom.

49:27.280 --> 49:29.120
I want to go out with a wizard wand

49:29.120 --> 49:31.280
because I would stand a better fucking chance

49:31.280 --> 49:34.160
than you would with your goddamn sword.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.280
What were his last words?

49:35.280 --> 49:36.240
His last words were,

49:36.240 --> 49:37.600
Presto, I'm a dipshit.

49:37.600 --> 49:42.720
Travis's last words were,

49:42.720 --> 49:45.360
my name is Inigo Montoya.

49:45.360 --> 49:45.760
You kill-

49:51.120 --> 49:52.080
Opsies!

49:52.080 --> 49:53.840
That was Travis's last word.

49:53.840 --> 49:55.280
He was doing the monologue,

49:55.280 --> 49:55.920
but then he said,

49:55.920 --> 49:56.400
Opsies.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.280
He said something about the quickening

50:03.280 --> 50:03.920
and then he bled out.

50:03.920 --> 50:04.960
He was dead as fuck.

50:05.680 --> 50:06.800
He was really dead

50:06.800 --> 50:07.920
and I miss him so much.

50:07.920 --> 50:08.720
He was my brother.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.880
He was a stupid man,

50:10.880 --> 50:12.240
but I loved him very much.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.960
He was great with a sword,

50:15.600 --> 50:17.920
as long as his enemy was not armed with a gun.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.920
Or any other weapon

50:19.920 --> 50:21.040
because swords are bullshit.

50:22.560 --> 50:23.120
Oh man,

50:23.840 --> 50:24.880
gotta tube that for me.

50:26.000 --> 50:26.640
My house,

50:26.640 --> 50:27.920
where I still live with my parents,

50:28.880 --> 50:30.400
was recently broken into.

50:31.600 --> 50:33.520
We had some electronics and jewelry stolen,

50:33.520 --> 50:34.240
if only,

50:35.040 --> 50:36.000
if only,

50:36.000 --> 50:37.360
had been armed with-

50:38.640 --> 50:40.560
With Sarah Travis McElroy.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.480
We had a security door installed

50:44.480 --> 50:45.360
to distort-

50:45.360 --> 50:45.840
Oh God,

50:45.840 --> 50:46.640
let me try again.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.400
We had a security door installed

50:48.400 --> 50:50.960
to deter any further attempts at theft

50:50.960 --> 50:53.120
and I believe my parents find that to be enough.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.400
I, however,

50:54.400 --> 50:56.240
would prefer to be more proactive

50:56.240 --> 50:58.560
and aggressive towards future thieves.

50:58.560 --> 50:59.520
Swords!

50:59.520 --> 51:01.520
So what methods would you suggest

51:01.520 --> 51:03.840
for further fortifying my home?

51:03.840 --> 51:06.480
A katana rack by the bedroom door.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.120
Oh, a katana rack.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.280
That's good because you're-

51:11.280 --> 51:13.520
It's both stylish and efficient.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.680
You might be cutting him so many times

51:15.680 --> 51:18.000
and not being killed for so long

51:18.000 --> 51:19.360
that you can wear down the edge

51:19.360 --> 51:20.320
on your first katana.

51:20.320 --> 51:22.640
So it's good if it's a band of thieves.

51:22.640 --> 51:23.280
Oh, good.

51:23.280 --> 51:23.520
Yeah,

51:23.520 --> 51:24.880
cause you might bury your katana

51:24.880 --> 51:25.760
in one of their chests

51:25.760 --> 51:26.880
while you're not getting shot.

51:29.600 --> 51:30.640
Hey, can I have that back?

51:30.640 --> 51:31.360
Ah, no.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.360
At least I killed one of you.

51:33.360 --> 51:36.240
I don't want to distract from my stupidity,

51:36.240 --> 51:38.160
but I do have the question as to

51:38.160 --> 51:39.680
what is a security door?

51:40.560 --> 51:41.040
It's like a-

51:41.040 --> 51:42.000
Isn't that like a door?

51:43.520 --> 51:44.160
I mean, yeah,

51:44.160 --> 51:45.360
but I think it's like metal.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.400
So you can't get through it.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.360
There's a retina scanner.

51:47.360 --> 51:47.920
I'm pretty sure.

51:47.920 --> 51:49.120
And there's a picture of Travis

51:49.120 --> 51:50.320
with a sword on the front of it.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.280
Beware of idiots.

51:53.280 --> 51:55.440
And then it says the words inside

51:55.440 --> 51:56.880
and then there's an arrow pointing to you.

51:58.320 --> 51:58.880
Just wait.

51:58.880 --> 51:59.760
This is inside.

51:59.760 --> 52:02.960
Stab, stabs and hoys.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.200
Beware of swordsmen.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.680
It says, it says,

52:09.680 --> 52:10.880
beware of swords at the top

52:10.880 --> 52:12.000
and then at the bottom it says,

52:12.000 --> 52:13.680
do you really want this on your conscience?

52:15.920 --> 52:16.400
Go on.

52:16.400 --> 52:17.760
He's, he's got enough problems.

52:17.760 --> 52:18.800
He's actually six.

52:18.800 --> 52:19.840
He has progeria.

52:23.280 --> 52:24.880
This is my son, Jack.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.920
He has Jack disease.

52:25.920 --> 52:26.880
He has Jack disease.

52:26.880 --> 52:27.840
Thinks he's a knight.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.200
His shit is fucked.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.240
Please be careful.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.080
It's the weird thing now.

52:34.080 --> 52:35.600
He has a lot of diamonds.

52:35.600 --> 52:40.160
So if you're in the market for a cheap one,

52:40.880 --> 52:41.600
he's your guy,

52:42.880 --> 52:44.560
which is probably why you're breaking in.

52:46.640 --> 52:48.000
But we'd rather you not.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.480
So, um, I panic room.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.440
Yeah, gotta go panic room.

52:56.960 --> 52:57.920
You get a panic room

52:57.920 --> 53:00.000
and don't get a half ass panic room.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.280
That's what I found.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.280
If you hang a blanket up over your closet,

53:03.280 --> 53:04.560
that is not a panic room.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.200
I'm afraid that's a,

53:07.200 --> 53:08.320
that is a tiny closet

53:08.320 --> 53:09.840
in which you may very well panic.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.040
If I knew Travis had a sword in the house,

53:15.040 --> 53:16.320
no room in my home wouldn't be.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.520
I would constantly be panicking about it.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.160
I hope he doesn't get it out today.

53:24.640 --> 53:25.920
So are we done here?

53:25.920 --> 53:27.920
Have we helped enough for one week?

53:29.280 --> 53:29.920
I think so.

53:34.640 --> 53:35.120
Jesus.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.600
So thank you so much for listening.

53:37.600 --> 53:38.480
Thank you to everyone

53:38.480 --> 53:39.760
who's been tweeting about the show.

53:40.640 --> 53:41.600
Turbo Toaster,

53:42.160 --> 53:43.120
Real Mike Dempsey,

53:44.640 --> 53:45.440
Real Nate Miller.

53:45.440 --> 53:46.400
There's a lot of real people,

53:46.400 --> 53:46.960
which I like.

53:46.960 --> 53:47.840
DJ Shanty,

53:48.400 --> 53:49.760
World Champ Dan,

53:49.760 --> 53:50.720
Infinite Brads,

53:51.680 --> 53:52.480
Zek Becker,

53:53.360 --> 53:54.080
Ham Doctors,

53:54.080 --> 53:56.640
our old friend,

53:56.640 --> 53:57.600
Craig C,

53:57.600 --> 53:58.720
Jens Dietrich,

53:58.720 --> 53:59.600
so many people,

53:59.600 --> 54:00.240
Fitzy Bear,

54:02.640 --> 54:04.320
and Casey Fitz,

54:04.320 --> 54:09.280
who I guess loves us more than her husband now.

54:09.280 --> 54:09.680
Okay.

54:09.680 --> 54:10.960
Which is fine.

54:10.960 --> 54:12.320
Which we're used to that.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.640
I think secretly in their heart of hearts,

54:14.640 --> 54:17.120
every wife and every husband

54:17.840 --> 54:19.440
loves us more than their significant other.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.120
It's life.

54:21.120 --> 54:22.000
Nothing to feel bad about,

54:22.000 --> 54:23.200
but thank you guys so much

54:23.200 --> 54:24.560
for tweeting about the show.

54:24.560 --> 54:26.320
Just use the MBM hashtag

54:26.320 --> 54:27.120
when you do that.

54:28.640 --> 54:29.760
Hey, don't forget that

54:30.800 --> 54:32.560
the second My Brother,

54:32.560 --> 54:33.120
My Brother,

54:33.120 --> 54:34.560
and Me mixtape

54:34.560 --> 54:35.920
by our friend Rocky Horror

54:35.920 --> 54:37.520
is live.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.840
What's the best way of getting that?

54:41.040 --> 54:42.320
I think iTunes.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.600
If you search Hell House,

54:44.800 --> 54:46.400
it's a podcast on iTunes

54:47.520 --> 54:50.880
and it's the February episode.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.560
Oh, well, there you go.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.840
That's a fine way of getting it.

54:55.840 --> 54:57.840
You can also go to myspace.com

54:59.840 --> 55:01.120
forward slash Rocky Horror-fied

55:01.680 --> 55:03.440
to learn more about our friend.

55:03.440 --> 55:04.880
I don't know if he's still using that or not,

55:04.880 --> 55:07.200
but he's also Rocky Horror on Twitter.

55:07.200 --> 55:08.160
He's fine in that way.

55:08.160 --> 55:09.520
You probably just ask him.

55:09.520 --> 55:10.720
RH Club Music.

55:10.720 --> 55:11.440
That's his website.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.280
RHclubmusic.com

55:13.280 --> 55:14.880
So go there and go get the second

55:14.880 --> 55:15.520
My Brother, My Brother,

55:15.520 --> 55:16.800
and Me mixtape

55:16.800 --> 55:18.320
and support him.

55:18.320 --> 55:20.960
Support all the other Maximum Fun podcasts.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.640
Please do us a favor, guys.

55:22.640 --> 55:25.440
This week, go to the Maximum Fun forum

55:26.160 --> 55:27.280
and just talk about us.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.120
Talk about this episode.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.000
We'll put a thread up

55:30.560 --> 55:32.160
and I promise this week

55:32.160 --> 55:33.840
I'll be better about being in there

55:33.840 --> 55:34.800
and talking to people.

55:34.800 --> 55:36.160
So if you want to come by,

55:36.160 --> 55:37.280
tell us what you thought, talk.

55:37.840 --> 55:38.800
We will all go in there

55:38.800 --> 55:40.160
and chat people up this week.

55:40.160 --> 55:41.600
So find that thread and comment on it

55:41.600 --> 55:42.960
because the other guys get...

55:42.960 --> 55:44.640
They talk about their show and...

55:44.640 --> 55:45.920
They're so popular.

55:45.920 --> 55:47.600
They're more powerful than ever.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.000
And I just want a little taste of that.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.640
So make sure that whatever you do,

55:52.640 --> 55:54.240
you go to Stacksoap.com

55:54.240 --> 55:55.040
and you check it out.

55:55.040 --> 55:55.840
Buy some Stacksoap.

55:55.840 --> 55:56.880
And you tell them we sent you.

55:57.600 --> 55:58.800
I want to thank John Roderick

55:58.800 --> 55:59.840
and The Long Winters

55:59.840 --> 56:00.960
for the use of our theme song

56:00.960 --> 56:02.160
It's a Departure off the album

56:02.160 --> 56:03.360
Putting the Days to Bed.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.200
I saw a lot of people on Twitter

56:07.200 --> 56:08.160
saying they bought it

56:08.880 --> 56:10.160
and that made me smile

56:10.160 --> 56:11.200
a little bit in my heart

56:11.840 --> 56:13.360
because it's a good album.

56:13.920 --> 56:14.720
It's a great band.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.800
And sometimes I just like to think

56:16.800 --> 56:19.920
that I'm sitting under the same big white moon

56:19.920 --> 56:21.120
just listening to the same tunes

56:21.120 --> 56:22.560
as somebody else in the world, you know?

56:23.280 --> 56:24.080
Yeah, that's good stuff.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.320
Forming a lunar music connection.

56:26.320 --> 56:27.520
That's beautiful, Griffin.

56:27.520 --> 56:28.800
You're a beautiful man.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.360
So that's it.

56:31.360 --> 56:32.320
That's our show.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.760
Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.920
Yeah, find somebody special you love

56:35.920 --> 56:36.960
and just squeeze them.

56:36.960 --> 56:37.440
Squeeze them.

56:38.720 --> 56:39.680
And keep listening.

56:39.680 --> 56:41.280
Go subscribe on iTunes and rate us

56:41.280 --> 56:43.120
and retweet the tweet about this show

56:43.120 --> 56:44.400
and we'll see you next week.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.640
Go and put us on your Facebook if you want.

56:46.640 --> 56:47.040
I don't know.

56:48.080 --> 56:48.880
Something.

56:48.880 --> 56:50.000
But thanks for listening.

56:50.000 --> 56:50.480
We love you.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.120
Thanks, everyone.

56:51.120 --> 56:53.600
This final Yahoo was sent in by Gali Ayali.

56:53.600 --> 56:54.240
Thank you, Gali.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.720
It's by Yahoo Answer's user, Turn, who asks,

56:57.840 --> 57:00.560
would Christianity be as popular as it is today

57:00.560 --> 57:03.120
if the Jesus was depicted more like Danny DeVito?

57:06.240 --> 57:07.520
I'm Justin McElroy.

57:07.520 --> 57:08.560
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:08.560 --> 57:09.760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:09.760 --> 57:10.480
This is with my brother.

57:10.480 --> 57:11.120
My brother and me.

57:11.120 --> 57:11.920
Kiss your dad.

57:11.920 --> 57:18.640
It's way out of the way.

57:18.640 --> 57:20.320
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.360
Keep your heart.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.520
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

57:23.520 --> 57:24.560
Keep your heart.

57:24.560 --> 57:25.840
Man, these girls are smart.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.600
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

57:27.600 --> 57:42.480
Three Stacks, Three Stacks, Three Stacks, Three Stacks.
