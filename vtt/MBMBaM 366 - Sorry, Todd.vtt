00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.400 --> 00:53.120
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.600
And I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, as told by Forbes Magazine

00:57.600 --> 01:02.480
for Business, Griffin McElroy. Woof, woof, everybody. The dog days are somewhere here.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.680
Bork, bork, bork. Dogs everywhere. As Florence and the Machine said,

01:07.680 --> 01:12.480
the dog days are here. Of summer, it's a hot one, like seven inches from the midday sun.

01:14.080 --> 01:21.600
Dogtown is here. We are the mayors of Dogtown. What you're listening to right now is something

01:21.600 --> 01:27.120
akin to comedy scatting. Just saying different words and phrases to see if

01:27.120 --> 01:33.120
a joke emerges from the rubble. This is just loose spaghetti flung around.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.280
Don't interrupt the fucking flow. Meow, these cool cats are here for the dog days of summer.

01:37.920 --> 01:43.920
Keep going, keep going, keep going. These show pops are cool summer buddies.

01:43.920 --> 01:50.160
Let's try some standards. Ghosts are in summer. Horses are in summer. I love riding my horse.

01:50.160 --> 01:55.680
It gets so sweaty in the summertime. Spooky Halloween's coming up. Ghost summer is ending.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.040
Halloween's just around the corner. Okay, that's fine. Let's ramp this.

01:59.040 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, Halloween's just around the corner. I can't wait for a ghoulish time as I wait

02:04.000 --> 02:08.320
for summer to die. Hey, everyone. Join my brother, my brother,

02:08.320 --> 02:16.400
and me as we stand around the wheezing corporeal form of summer and watch as it's final breaths.

02:16.400 --> 02:21.760
And then when it dies, it'll be a ghost. So there's one. And the dog days are

02:21.760 --> 02:27.760
here of summer. Long days, long nights. Just can't wait for this season to finally perish in my arms.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.760
Do you guys, are you guys summer people? Do you feel-

02:31.760 --> 02:37.760
No, God. Fuck no. Fuck you. Fuck you, Justin. Come on, fuck you, Justin. Why do you think I'm so excited for the dog days?

02:37.760 --> 02:43.760
I start to get a little bit panicky towards the end of summer. Like, have I, did I get out on the lake enough?

02:43.760 --> 02:49.760
Did I make enough of this summertime season? Did I, before, you know, fall comes and,

02:49.760 --> 02:57.760
I don't know, did I make enough of this summer? Well, now you got me stressing, because I got the boat, you know.

02:57.760 --> 03:05.760
And after the last max fun drive, got me the boat. And I haven't taken that baby out on the river once this sum-sum.

03:05.760 --> 03:13.760
And I'm wondering if it's time or, it's tough to, you know, it's tough to raise the sail during the dog days.

03:13.760 --> 03:19.760
Because summer might end while I'm out there, and I can't be fucking on my boat in the fall, I'll get arrested.

03:19.760 --> 03:25.760
Now you guys have got me worried, because I also have the boat, as you know, the Travis 2.

03:25.760 --> 03:33.760
Yeah. And I'm, I'm worried because I'm just worried that this summer, and really this year,

03:33.760 --> 03:40.760
I haven't spent enough time on the boat before at the end of the year, I have to kill this form and enter my 2018 body.

03:40.760 --> 03:46.760
It's tough. And the 2017 model didn't spend enough time out on Travis 2.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.760
And the boat's not gonna recognize your new body. It's tough. It's so tough.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.760
The genetic imprint is completely different. That's what the scientists are working on.

03:54.760 --> 04:01.760
And I hear, I hear my boat crying in the garage. I hear, I hear my boat, the boat from Jaws is what I named it.

04:01.760 --> 04:07.760
It's crying in the garage, because I'm just not taking it out. And it knows it's the dog days.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.760
Yeah, and it's like you always say, you know, a boat in the garage is sad,

04:11.760 --> 04:16.760
because that's not where boats are supposed to be. They're supposed to be on the water?

04:16.760 --> 04:17.760
Or a marina.

04:17.760 --> 04:22.760
You guys have gotten me worried now, because my, I'm looking at my boat through the window.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.760
Oh fuck.

04:23.760 --> 04:30.760
My fully armed battleship, the Orion. And I wonder, have I gotten out on the water and defended this great country

04:30.760 --> 04:40.760
in my one-man, non-government armada slash militia to, I'm sort of an independent operator.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.760
I mean, the kaiju are coming, Justin, and you haven't done enough.

04:44.760 --> 04:50.760
Right, I haven't even transformed into Orion's bipedal form all summer.

04:50.760 --> 04:56.760
So have I done enough this summer to defend our coast against the incoming kaiju?

04:56.760 --> 05:01.760
Justin's looking at his extra-national sort of outer heaven situation

05:01.760 --> 05:06.760
and wondering if he's not gotten out on the Ohio River enough to fight off the attackers.

05:06.760 --> 05:13.760
Right, I look at the geodesic Hoverdome and I think, have I used my hyper-powerful telescopes

05:13.760 --> 05:19.760
to monitor the shores in case of kaiju enough? And I don't know that I have.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.760
I did some grilling, of course.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.760
Yeah, on the boat?

05:23.760 --> 05:31.760
Yes. Well, it has a built-in radiation-powered grill that is very fast.

05:31.760 --> 05:37.760
That's a problem, is that the radioactive fission core of my metal gear gets so hot.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.760
And during the dog days...

05:39.760 --> 05:41.760
Who wants to be in there?

05:41.760 --> 05:46.760
Who wants to even convert their battleship into a battle zeppelin?

05:46.760 --> 05:48.760
Get, what, closer to the sun?

05:48.760 --> 05:56.760
Now I'm five inches from the midday sun and it's even hotter here.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.760
Might as well be walking on the sun.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.760
Another great one.

06:00.760 --> 06:09.760
Now I gotta say, that's the one good thing about these dog days is the soundtrack is so good

06:09.760 --> 06:13.760
because you got smooth and you got walking on the sun and that's it.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.760
Break off the dial, you don't need it anymore.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.760
Also, I think there's some Sheryl Crow in there.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.760
You gotta round it out with some Sheryl.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.760
We're on a first name basis.

06:24.760 --> 06:29.760
If you have been struggling in the same ways that we're describing, do not fear,

06:29.760 --> 06:33.760
because this is, despite all external signs, an advice podcast.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.760
So we're gonna take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

06:37.760 --> 06:44.760
Oh, I thought you were gonna say, despite all evidence to the contrary, this is a comedy podcast.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.760
Now Travis, don't nag me.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.760
I gotta do this show.

06:49.760 --> 06:54.760
Real quick, I hate to break the flow, but this is a Yahoo sent in by Morgan Davey from Yahoo Answers user Ragdoll

06:54.760 --> 06:58.760
who says, obscene reference in the first line of smooth by Carlos Santana?

06:58.760 --> 07:01.760
Man, it's a hot one, like seven inches from the midday sun.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.760
Is this a tongue-in-cheek reference to a seven inch erection?

07:04.760 --> 07:06.760
Actually, it says election.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.760
What do you think?

07:08.760 --> 07:12.760
Okay, I wanna, let's really analyze that for a moment.

07:12.760 --> 07:20.760
Like, if that was the case, someone would have looked at both Carlos and, oh no, it's escaping me,

07:20.760 --> 07:25.760
don't say Rob, Carlos and Rob, and said, what do you mean by that?

07:25.760 --> 07:28.760
Like, you know, how you put your penis close to the sun.

07:28.760 --> 07:34.760
Well, no, the song is about an attractive person who Rob or Carlos,

07:34.760 --> 07:38.760
speaking through Rob as a vessel, as we all do from time to time,

07:38.760 --> 07:43.760
is about, sees an attractive woman and, you know, sings a song about how she's so smooth.

07:43.760 --> 07:50.760
And so, maybe she's like the midday sun, and just seeing this person has made Rob Thomas bring a boner.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.760
I think it, it probably more likely, it is definitely about an erection,

07:55.760 --> 08:01.760
but I think it was more likely Rob Thomas is like, or Carlos says to Rob,

08:01.760 --> 08:06.760
hey Rob, my man, we're just gonna freestyle this first intro, and I was thinking we'd kinda do an Icarus thing.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.760
Do you know the story of Icarus exactly verbatim?

08:08.760 --> 08:11.760
And Rob Thomas is like, yeah, I know, I remember that one.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.760
It's about the guy who got his penis too close to the sun.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.760
Here we go.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.760
He said, wait, hold on, well, music's already rolling.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.760
No, we're already playing it.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.760
Just keep playing it, Carlos.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
I know this song.

08:22.760 --> 08:23.760
I know the story.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.760
Now, son, this is gonna sound pretty wild, but I've built these wings out of wax and feathers,

08:28.760 --> 08:34.760
because I think I can fucking fly, and I can finally achieve my life's goal to fuck the sun.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.760
Now, dad.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
Well, well, pops.

08:37.760 --> 08:41.760
Pops, there's some issues there, I think.

08:41.760 --> 08:46.760
Well, what most people don't know is the song is actually about how Rob Thomas did fuck the sun,

08:46.760 --> 08:52.760
and it melted away all the fighting features of his penis and made his penis completely smooth,

08:52.760 --> 08:56.760
just like a featureless cylinder.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.760
Give me your featureless cylinder.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.760
Let's forget about it.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.760
Please forget about this.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.760
Oh, man.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.760
My perfectly smooth penis.

09:08.760 --> 09:16.760
The Rob Thomas does seem like the kind of guy who's like, I've had monumental recording success.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.760
I've got many platinum records.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.760
I created Veronica Mars.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.760
I created Veronica Mars.

09:22.760 --> 09:28.760
There's nothing left for me to achieve, except I do think I'm gonna fuck the sun just one time.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.760
I mean, everybody in Smash Mouth is like, don't do it.

09:31.760 --> 09:32.760
I've been there.

09:32.760 --> 09:38.760
It seems like a good idea, Rob, but trust me, you'll end up with a featureless penis like me.

09:38.760 --> 09:45.760
I think every man, when he reaches a certain level of success, is like, nothing left to do but fuck the sun.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.760
Why do you think Elon Musk is trying to get those spaceships going up so high?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.760
That's why Bezos was working out so hard.

09:51.760 --> 09:55.760
Bezos just wants to get up there and be like, I'm gonna wrestle the sun.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.760
Sorry, stop the podcast.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.760
Did you say Bezos?

09:59.760 --> 10:02.760
Yeah, that's what I like to call him.

10:02.760 --> 10:08.760
I remember when Jeff Bezos was an alien that taught me about manners.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.760
Oh, man.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.760
Jeff Bezbos.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.760
Jeff Bezbos was an alien that taught me about manners.

10:13.760 --> 10:14.760
Jesus, what a deep cut.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.760
How about we do this first question?

10:15.760 --> 10:16.760
Yeah, thank you.

10:16.760 --> 10:17.760
Yes, thank you.

10:17.760 --> 10:22.760
A couple weeks ago, a somewhat large package was delivered to my house.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.760
Oh, I get it.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.760
I get it now.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.760
I should have gone farther.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.760
The address was correct, but the name was not.

10:28.760 --> 10:34.760
I wrote return to sender on it and left it out on my porch for the mailman to take back.

10:34.760 --> 10:39.760
I've also tried looking up the recipient on Facebook to try to contact them but have had no luck.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.760
It's been days now and the mailman refused to take it back.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.760
How much longer do I need to wait until I can open the package?

10:45.760 --> 10:47.760
Because the not knowing what's inside is killing me.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.760
That's from unintentional mail thief.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.760
Okay, two things.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.760
One, that's a federal crime.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.760
So the answer is never, I guess.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.760
Can you open it because it's a federal crime.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.760
So you shouldn't do that.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.760
That's a dumb.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.760
Hey, that's a dumb crime.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.760
That's a dumb law.

11:04.760 --> 11:05.760
Okay.

11:05.760 --> 11:11.760
It seems like if I get my hands on your mail by hook or by crook, I should be able to open it.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.760
Possession being nine tenths of the law.

11:13.760 --> 11:21.760
Well, if it goes to your house and it's addressed to your house and has been there for a while and you can't get in touch with the other person, I think it's your belonging at a certain point.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.760
Griffin, you are killing me because Justin started with bullet points.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.760
He said one and you didn't let him say two.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.760
And now I feel incomplete and I have to know what Justin's key was going to be.

11:30.760 --> 11:31.760
Justin, what's number two?

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
Hit me.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.760
The two is I always thought they would take it back.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.760
I'm kind of sticking out.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.760
Yeah, I'm a little wild.

11:38.760 --> 11:47.760
I kind of always had that in my back pocket knowing that like if I did get a package that was not for me, I could just write return to sender on it and it would go away.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.760
But I guess not.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.760
I didn't realize the mail was a yours now scenario.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.760
Yeah, like you have to do it.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.760
That's the way you create new mail.

11:56.760 --> 12:00.760
People is like, well, you have to go deliver it and then you can never stop.

12:00.760 --> 12:05.760
It seems like maybe you could take it to the mail place.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.760
That seems like a huge chore.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.760
They have just like airlifted onto you.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.760
That seems very unfair.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.760
And if it and if at the mail place.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.760
Also, some people call it a post office.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.760
If they're like, we can't do anything with that.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.760
You can just leave.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.760
I call it bubblegum's mail company.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.760
I don't know what you guys.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.760
You go to bubblegum's mail company.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.760
You take the big box up there like, oh, we can't do anything with that.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.760
You just literally just very slowly back away.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.760
And then it is somebody else's box.

12:31.760 --> 12:32.760
Here's the problem.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.760
Here's why you can't open it.

12:34.760 --> 12:49.760
Because I have seen like intrigue mystery movies before and you're going to open this and that's how you find out like that you have a clone or that you are now wrapped up in the middle of like a political scandal.

12:49.760 --> 12:55.760
Or that you have, you know, 24 hours to solve your own murder.

12:55.760 --> 12:56.760
Something like that.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.760
That's what happens in these movies.

12:58.760 --> 13:04.760
Or you're going to open it up and it's just going to be like some like spoiled steak of the month club.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.760
So like one way or another, don't open it.

13:07.760 --> 13:12.760
Can I tell you all a story that is 100% absolutely true that I've never talked about on this podcast?

13:12.760 --> 13:13.760
Yes.

13:13.760 --> 13:21.760
This happened to me while we were living at this house and we got a big box delivered like a huge truck came and dropped it off on a pallet.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.760
And so it's just like taking up our entire like entryway outside.

13:25.760 --> 13:31.760
And I signed for it because I was like, whoa, what did Nintendo send me this time?

13:31.760 --> 13:34.760
It's a bunch of Yoshis in here.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.760
But then I looked at the name on it and it wasn't my name nor was it a person's name.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.760
It was just the name of some like business I had never heard of.

13:42.760 --> 13:50.760
So to try to get to the bottom of it, I Googled the name of the business and it turned out what this package was supposed to be going to.

13:50.760 --> 13:51.760
Again, the address was my address.

13:51.760 --> 13:56.760
So I guess that somebody who used to live in my house now works at this place.

13:56.760 --> 14:02.760
The business was for a local like Ninja Warrior training gymnasium.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.760
Whoa.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.760
Yes.

14:05.760 --> 14:12.760
And so it's sort of like a gym factory, but like they saw the shit and were like, we got to get some salmon ladders up in here.

14:12.760 --> 14:21.760
And so this was a difficult day for me for so many reasons, because like I'm a I'm an I'm, you know, I was an Eagle Scout.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.760
That's not true.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.760
And so, like, I made sure I needed to get this back in the proper hands.

14:25.760 --> 14:38.760
But at the same time, if there is a salmon ladder in there that I could use to sort of hone my body, hone my craft to take on that big course and impress all my fellow Ninja Warrior friends.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.760
Oh, I wanted to just know that.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
Are you kidding?

14:41.760 --> 14:44.760
What sort of Ninja Warrior training?

14:44.760 --> 14:48.760
Is there a fucking fourteen and a half foot curved wall in there?

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
Tell me what it is.

14:49.760 --> 14:55.760
So I just called the business and somebody came and got it and they gave me free lessons for my whole life.

14:55.760 --> 15:01.760
And that's right. You're going to see me on NBC this fall climbing Mount Midoriyama.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.760
Just like, this is because I was honest.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.760
I'm powered by truth.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.760
They're going to hit that buzzer and the hosts are going to be like, good job, Griffin.

15:10.760 --> 15:14.760
You're so honest. And I'll be like, I know I wanted to steal it so bad, but I didn't.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.760
They're American Ninja Warrior.

15:16.760 --> 15:21.760
If we could take a brief pivot, I think we've helped this male person enough to talk about American Ninja Warrior.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.760
I haven't explicitly watched every episode of this season.

15:24.760 --> 15:29.760
I am following it and I don't know why, but it's just on and I'm just like, here we go.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.760
Time to see what Kevin Bull's up to.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.760
You're kind of undercutting my point, but I'm going to go ahead and make it anyway.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.760
I have never intentionally watched American Ninja Warrior.

15:38.760 --> 15:46.760
The only context is when I have a group of people of desperate interests and sometimes you just want something on TV,

15:46.760 --> 15:50.760
while people are like chatting just in the background to sort of like chill on.

15:50.760 --> 15:54.760
And it seems like I end up on American Ninja Warrior a lot.

15:54.760 --> 15:58.760
It seems like that's the only context in which I watch American Ninja Warrior.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.760
There's like a bunch of people together. It's like, hey, this is on.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.760
This is very widely accessible.

16:03.760 --> 16:10.760
It's a category of TV that I also put, I think Mythbusters is one we've talked about before.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.760
Fixer Upper, I also put Fixer Upper on there.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.760
Okay, okay.

16:14.760 --> 16:18.760
I mean, most HDTV shows is just like, yeah, let's just tune in.

16:18.760 --> 16:25.760
If I could follow up on that, Justin, I also love the phenomenon that happens where you just put that on in the background while like 10 people talk about whatever.

16:25.760 --> 16:37.760
And over time, you can track as people's interest does eventually go to American Ninja Warrior and suddenly it's a party about watching American Ninja Warrior.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.760
That wasn't your intention, of course.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.760
No.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.760
But now you're having an American Ninja Warrior watch party.

16:43.760 --> 16:48.760
But my wife recently revealed to me after some such incident.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.760
Can I admit something to you?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.760
I said, of course, dear, of course.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.760
I hate American Ninja Warrior.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.760
Oh, no.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.760
I was like, wait, what?

16:56.760 --> 17:02.760
And then like my world of TV shows, like background TV, got like smaller.

17:02.760 --> 17:07.760
Now that's out of – because I know my wife is in pain watching American Ninja Warrior.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.760
And you know what?

17:08.760 --> 17:13.760
When I pressed her for details, because it doesn't make any sense, she said to me, it's dumb.

17:13.760 --> 17:19.760
I mean, it's just so cruel at sea.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.760
I mean, she just said it's dumb.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.760
She said it's a dumb thing.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.760
I think it's a great show about the triumph of the human spirit.

17:27.760 --> 17:34.760
And we hit a point where like we were watching it because it was just like on TV and we had cable and needed to justify the expense of cable.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
And so we watched it.

17:35.760 --> 17:40.760
And then we just had a day where we were watching it and we realized that we weren't just watching it because it was on cable.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.760
We had actually looked it up on demand on Hulu.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.760
We had sought out American Ninja Warrior and invited it cordially into our home.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.760
And we were like, whoa, who are we?

17:49.760 --> 17:50.760
What are we doing?

17:50.760 --> 17:51.760
What are we doing?

17:51.760 --> 17:52.760
How about Yahoo?

17:52.760 --> 17:53.760
Yeah, please.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.760
This is a series.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.760
This is a short story.

17:56.760 --> 18:01.760
A few people sent in parts of the story, but Stella Heyman was the only one who sent in all the parts of it.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.760
Thank you, Stella.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.760
It's a three-parter.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.760
And all of them were asked by Yahoo Answers user Estelle.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.760
And try to follow the plot, if you will.

18:09.760 --> 18:10.760
First one.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.760
Yesterday, a dog along the canal tried attacking a swan on land.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.760
And the swan attacked it and the dog backed off.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.760
Why did it back off?

18:18.760 --> 18:23.760
Number two, do you think a small dog could kill an adult swan?

18:23.760 --> 18:28.760
Number three, could a chihuahua kill an adult swan?

18:28.760 --> 18:30.760
Are these all the same user?

18:30.760 --> 18:32.760
All the same user, in order.

18:32.760 --> 18:37.760
These three questions, fleshing out the story with more and more details.

18:37.760 --> 18:38.760
What is the gap?

18:38.760 --> 18:39.760
What is the time gap?

18:39.760 --> 18:40.760
Not long.

18:40.760 --> 18:44.760
I mean, Yahoo, of course, doesn't provide information quite that granular.

18:44.760 --> 18:52.760
Just enough time to build an evidence dungeon wall linking chihuahuas and swans

18:52.760 --> 18:55.760
and any news reports about dogs attacking swans.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.760
But no small dogs, and specifically, no chihuahuas.

18:58.760 --> 19:07.760
It seems like this person probably was being threatened or harassed by a swan.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.760
They looked around at their resources and the only sort of defense they had

19:11.760 --> 19:14.760
was the chihuahua they owned.

19:14.760 --> 19:19.760
And it seemed like maybe this was at crises of confidence during the training phase,

19:19.760 --> 19:21.760
where it's like, you know what?

19:21.760 --> 19:25.760
I'm spending so much time teaching him how to do backflips and bite on command.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.760
Is this worth it?

19:27.760 --> 19:29.760
Is this a good application of my minutes?

19:29.760 --> 19:36.760
You know, I bet if that scene played out where the chihuahua started to mess with the swan

19:36.760 --> 19:38.760
and then the swan scared the chihuahua away,

19:38.760 --> 19:42.760
I bet if a wolf was watching that, he would just be like, fuck.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.760
Really? This is where we've come now? How dare you?

19:45.760 --> 19:47.760
Because here's the thing.

19:47.760 --> 19:52.760
A swan should not be able to win in a fight over a canine on land.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.760
Swan is air superiority.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.760
But on land, walking around on land?

19:57.760 --> 19:59.760
Come on, right?

19:59.760 --> 20:02.760
Well, I say that, but a swan won in a fight against me at Kings Island one time.

20:02.760 --> 20:07.760
Well, Griffith, you don't have land, air, or water superiority.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.760
Only needs a warrior.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.760
I should also point out, I didn't know we were fighting.

20:12.760 --> 20:19.760
I was a young child, and I saw a beautiful swan, or maybe a goose, but they're really the same,

20:19.760 --> 20:24.760
and walked over to it, and I guess I was like, I saw that long and elegant and frankly sexy neck,

20:24.760 --> 20:27.760
and I was like, I'd love to just pet that.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.760
And then suddenly it became...

20:30.760 --> 20:32.760
The fight started without your...

20:32.760 --> 20:37.760
It wasn't a fight until it was, and then all of a sudden it wasn't won again,

20:37.760 --> 20:42.760
because I did just sort of run as fast as I possibly could away from the offending bird.

20:42.760 --> 20:43.760
Okay.

20:43.760 --> 20:48.760
I actually think in that circumstance, and I'm going to broaden the definition of winning here,

20:48.760 --> 20:53.760
to say if you escaped a creature that can fly, you won. You won that.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.760
Oh, okay.

20:54.760 --> 20:59.760
I didn't feel like it, because it bit my fingers very, very hard, and it ruined my whole day,

20:59.760 --> 21:03.760
and I went on the Tomb Raider ride, and I was still just very shaken.

21:03.760 --> 21:07.760
After a swan bites you, it dies.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.760
Oh.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.760
It'll die shortly after.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.760
Well, yeah, it did fill me with its one charge of venom from its sacks.

21:13.760 --> 21:17.760
And Griffin, did you have to go with Avlack?

21:17.760 --> 21:18.760
Oh, that's fun.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.760
And I know that's a duck. Don't at me.

21:20.760 --> 21:28.760
How angry, as a bee, do you have to be to be like, actually, you know what, I thought about it.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.760
Carmine, Vicky, fuck this guy.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.760
I'm going to, no, don't do it.

21:32.760 --> 21:33.760
Reg, no, no, no.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.760
Come on, Reg.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.760
Fuck this guy.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.760
He won't let me near his Pepsi.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.760
He's being a real fuckhead.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.760
I'm going to get him.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.760
I'm going to get him.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.760
Actually, you know what?

21:43.760 --> 21:44.760
Fuck this guy.

21:44.760 --> 21:45.760
I'm going to do it.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.760
This has been so cool hanging out with you guys.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.760
I'm going to do it.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.760
Fuck him.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.760
When are bees going to realize that they die and we don't?

21:53.760 --> 21:54.760
Well, some of them.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.760
That's what happened.

21:55.760 --> 21:59.760
One person who was allergic to bees got stung by a bee, and the other bees watched that person die,

21:59.760 --> 22:01.760
and they're like, well, this is a one-in-one transition.

22:01.760 --> 22:05.760
Yeah, we lose one of ours, but they lose one of theirs, too.

22:05.760 --> 22:11.760
They saw the propaganda film My Girl, and they're like, whoa, we're fucking dope.

22:11.760 --> 22:18.760
Here's what I'll say about geese and swan and ducks and the whole, if they got bills, then they're in it for kills.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.760
Here's what I got to say about this entire genus of birds.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.760
I think they're always going to win.

22:23.760 --> 22:28.760
It's because they're always – for them, it's always a fight.

22:28.760 --> 22:38.760
A chihuahua approaches a goose or swan or duck or gosling, and they think, I'm curious about this thing.

22:38.760 --> 22:45.760
Let's get close to inspect it, and then they get honked, and then they've lost the fight.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.760
You know what I mean?

22:46.760 --> 22:47.760
Sure.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.760
The swan and goose and duck and goslings, they're all just constantly ready to attack,

22:51.760 --> 22:57.760
and so they will get that first strike, and that first strike is always – it catches you.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.760
That was me at Kings Island.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.760
What?

23:00.760 --> 23:06.760
No, certainly not, and then the fight was done because the psychological damage was so tremendous.

23:06.760 --> 23:11.760
If you were walking through a park that had a pond or some kind of water feature,

23:11.760 --> 23:20.760
and you saw just a flock of geese or swans or whatever just hanging out on the shore near the water,

23:20.760 --> 23:25.760
and they're sitting amongst them completely peacefully, all sitting in harmony.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.760
It's just a chihuahua just hanging out.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.760
How fucking freaked out would you be?

23:30.760 --> 23:31.760
Yeah, that's a good point.

23:31.760 --> 23:37.760
I would be very confused by that moment of like, how did that chihuahua get in good with those geese?

23:37.760 --> 23:39.760
Why are they chill?

23:39.760 --> 23:42.760
What does that – what's he know that I don't?

23:42.760 --> 23:44.760
How about another question?

23:44.760 --> 23:45.760
Sure.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.760
This one is – has a beginning like this.

23:49.760 --> 23:54.760
I have a friend who uses entirely too many hashtags on social media.

23:54.760 --> 23:55.760
Oof.

23:55.760 --> 24:00.760
At a minimum, she uses about 15, but I've counted upwards of 30 on many occasions.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.760
I understand their purpose as a marketing tool, but this is a personal account,

24:04.760 --> 24:07.760
and the hashtags she uses are not keywords people are searching.

24:07.760 --> 24:14.760
Previous hashtags include hashtag ideas, hashtag Saturday, hashtag door, and hashtag woo.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.760
How do I tell my friend enough is enough?

24:17.760 --> 24:19.760
That probably is supposed to be my –

24:19.760 --> 24:20.760
But I like it better that way.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.760
Not a leprechaun thing.

24:22.760 --> 24:31.760
Or do I need to just accept that my lot in life is to be bombarded with 27 hashtags every time she posts on Instagram?

24:31.760 --> 24:32.760
Please advise.

24:32.760 --> 24:40.760
And that's from a hostage in hashtag hell.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.760
I don't think you can say these are not hashtags people are searching,

24:43.760 --> 24:48.760
because this is the beautiful thing about these wonderful little inventions

24:48.760 --> 24:53.760
is that they're always forming these just powerful just rainbow connections

24:53.760 --> 24:58.760
of somebody who's like, look at this new hashtag door I've got.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.760
And then they say, I wonder who else has doors on hashtag Saturday.

25:02.760 --> 25:07.760
And then they see, oh, man, there's someone in hashtag hell or wherever they live

25:07.760 --> 25:11.760
who's also installing a new door this Saturday, hashtag woo.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.760
Oh, that's there too.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.760
That's so exciting.

25:15.760 --> 25:20.760
It's all about SEO, and I don't know what that stands for, but I do know it's all about that.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.760
It doesn't stand for anything, Travis.

25:21.760 --> 25:27.760
It's CO, and it's sort of just sort of a concept.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.760
It's some industry jargon for sure.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.760
Hashtag thank you for explaining that, Griffin.

25:31.760 --> 25:32.760
All one word.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.760
Jesus, this bit actually grosses me out in a major way.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.760
I feel like fucking Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake right now.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.760
They're hugely popular.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.760
If I could have just a tenth of their success, I'd be extremely thrilled.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.760
Let me just say this, folks.

25:45.760 --> 25:51.760
It's 2017, and if I could give you some advice about social media, one, quit it.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.760
Everybody just get off.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.760
Just quit.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.760
Everybody quit it.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.760
Secondly, though, I will say this.

25:56.760 --> 26:02.760
I think that the thing about social media that everyone should keep in mind all the time

26:02.760 --> 26:10.760
is that it should be 100% a completely opt-in experience, no penalties, no questions.

26:10.760 --> 26:14.760
It's just if you want this, it's here.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.760
If you don't want it, I do not care.

26:17.760 --> 26:24.760
And you should start, like if this person's social media brand bothers you, fucking bail on it.

26:24.760 --> 26:25.760
Bounce.

26:25.760 --> 26:26.760
Don't ask me about it.

26:26.760 --> 26:27.760
Fucking bounce.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.760
And if they notice the count's going down, maybe they could do a little market research

26:30.760 --> 26:32.760
to see where things went wrong.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.760
But it's not up to you to be like, let me curtail you.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.760
No.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.760
Just bounce.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.760
You don't owe anybody anything.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.760
And she's like, why did you bounce?

26:40.760 --> 26:42.760
I'm like, that's not your problem.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.760
You can't ask that either.

26:44.760 --> 26:48.760
You quit without asking, and nobody can ask why anybody bounced or anything.

26:48.760 --> 26:54.760
I probably mute more people on Twitter than I follow, because I say, I care about you.

26:54.760 --> 26:55.760
I'm following you.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.760
I'm here for you.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.760
But I can't mute more people than I follow.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.760
But you know what I'm saying.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.760
I mute a lot of people I follow.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.760
I follow and be like, I like you as a person.

27:03.760 --> 27:06.760
And then I mute them and say, I don't like your brand.

27:06.760 --> 27:07.760
I don't like your-

27:07.760 --> 27:08.760
You're great.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.760
Your thoughts are shitty.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.760
And I hate them.

27:11.760 --> 27:16.760
I would say literally 25% of the people that I follow, I instantly mute.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.760
I get a quick taste of their thing.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.760
And I'm like, I want to be seen following you, but I don't want to see your brand.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.760
I don't want to experience you.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.760
I don't want to experience your brand, but I want to say, I just fucking love it in concept.

27:28.760 --> 27:35.760
And this is just sort of a vote for you as a person, but your brand is whack and I'm actually out.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.760
And here's the thing.

27:36.760 --> 27:37.760
You'll never know I'm out.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.760
So everybody wins.

27:39.760 --> 27:49.760
You keep on being whack and I will keep on getting the sort of like the drift effect of following you, but not actually experiencing-

27:49.760 --> 27:54.760
I want to say, Justin, I would actually love that from the reverse side.

27:54.760 --> 28:02.760
If my follow count kept going up, but the same number of people commented and responded to my shit, that would be the ideal.

28:02.760 --> 28:10.760
Look how many followers I have, but I can tweet like, just has a good ice cream without having people just flood my inbox with shit.

28:10.760 --> 28:15.760
There's a lot of people that follow me that I hope follow this same procedure.

28:15.760 --> 28:21.760
I tweeted this week about Titus from Kimmy Schmidt.

28:21.760 --> 28:28.760
I tweeted about how he would be a good person to play taco in a movie or TV show.

28:28.760 --> 28:33.760
That's not like happening, but I thought it would be funny if Titus Burgess was taco in a movie or TV show.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.760
And then he tweeted back when he was like, I don't know what taco is, but I'm going to look into it.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.760
And then he followed me.

28:37.760 --> 28:46.760
And my first thought was, man, I hope he fucking mutes me because I don't have a feed curtail like that is curated in such a way.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.760
Like Hodgman and Elizabeth Gilbert both follow me on Twitter.

28:49.760 --> 28:50.760
Fuck, I hope I'm muted.

28:50.760 --> 28:56.760
I don't need them to be like, hear my fucking near automata reports.

28:56.760 --> 29:00.760
I don't need President Barack Hussein Obama.

29:00.760 --> 29:04.760
I don't need him seeing me shove Nintendo toys in my gob.

29:04.760 --> 29:12.760
I've been rewatching Smallville, very much enjoying Michael Rosenbaum's performances Lex.

29:12.760 --> 29:16.760
And I tweeted about how much I've been enjoying Michael Rosenbaum's performances Lex.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.760
And he followed me and I thought, oh, no.

29:18.760 --> 29:25.760
Now he's going to see every time I tweet about enjoying his performances Lex, which has been a lot lately, like 10 or 12 times a day.

29:25.760 --> 29:26.760
He does a great job.

29:26.760 --> 29:30.760
But now he's going to know how much I enjoy his performances Lex.

29:30.760 --> 29:31.760
That's really weird, Travis.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.760
I didn't see those tweet.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.760
Oh, oh, never.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.760
Never mind.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.760
Oh, I see.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.760
Griffin.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.760
I'd love to get a hold on.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.760
Did you mute me?

29:43.760 --> 29:46.760
Oh, I'd love to get a fun campaign going.

29:46.760 --> 29:54.760
A little social media campaign going where if Justin McElroy follows you, just tweet at him and just be like, hey, just checking in.

29:54.760 --> 29:58.760
Please confirm receipt of message over.

29:58.760 --> 29:59.760
Please do that.

29:59.760 --> 30:04.760
If Justin McElroy follows you, just hit him up with a like, hey, just want to make sure.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
Over.

30:05.760 --> 30:12.760
Every once in a while, I'll like search my name for some reason and maybe do it on like a different account or a platform where I haven't muted people.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.760
And I'll see a tweet to me from somebody of like, I thought they died.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.760
Like, no, they didn't die, Justin.

30:18.760 --> 30:19.760
You muted them three years ago.

30:19.760 --> 30:25.760
So you killed them individually, but still aren't bored with them as a human being.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.760
You just can't get on board with their social brand.

30:27.760 --> 30:31.760
Boy, this whole bit has been pretty insufferable.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.760
Should we go to the money zone?

30:32.760 --> 30:33.760
There's some good stuff in there.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.760
Yeah.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.760
I think we just said brand a lot.

30:36.760 --> 30:39.760
Yeah, we said brand far too much.

30:39.760 --> 30:51.760
So let's talk about brands in the money zone.

30:51.760 --> 30:56.760
Hey, I want to tell everybody about Casper because we're supported in part by Casper for this episode.

30:56.760 --> 31:01.760
They're an online retailer, premium obsessively engineered mattresses you can get for a fraction of the price.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.760
I think we all have Casper's at this point.

31:04.760 --> 31:07.760
Ours is in the nursery guest room area.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.760
We used to sleep on it all the time.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.760
I'll be frank, kind of the baby sleeps in there now.

31:12.760 --> 31:22.760
And we I mean, I wouldn't even I get up to pee a lot at night and I'm not going to run the risk of waking up my my child after fighting tooth and nail for his slumbers.

31:22.760 --> 31:23.760
But it's a good mattress.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.760
It's very, very, very comfortable.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.760
And they have a risk free trial and return policy.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.760
You can try sleeping on a Casper for 100 days with free delivery to the US and Canada.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.760
And they got painless returns if you don't like it.

31:33.760 --> 31:41.760
All the mattresses are made in America, feature supportive memory foam for a sleep surface that's got just the right sink, just the right bounce.

31:41.760 --> 31:48.760
And my bit man listeners can get $50 towards any mattress purchase if you go to Casper.com slash my brother and use the promo code my brother.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.760
All one word at checkout.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.760
Terms and conditions apply.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.760
I want to tell you about Blue Apron.

31:55.760 --> 31:56.760
I love that play.

31:56.760 --> 32:01.760
It's it's a meal subscription service that we are all big fans of.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.760
I use it all the time.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.760
It has fed me and my family many a time.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.760
Here's the best thing about it.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.760
You don't have to know how to cook to use it.

32:10.760 --> 32:16.760
I'd be amazed if anybody listening to this or really any podcast hasn't already heard about Blue Apron.

32:16.760 --> 32:22.760
But just in case you haven't, they send to your house a box filled with everything you need.

32:22.760 --> 32:25.760
Mine is like salt and pepper and olive oil.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.760
But like everything else you need to make the dish.

32:29.760 --> 32:34.760
Instructions easy to follow, broken down step by step.

32:34.760 --> 32:35.760
Here's what you do.

32:35.760 --> 32:39.760
And if you do these things, you will have a great meal.

32:39.760 --> 32:43.760
It's affordable for less than $10 per person per meal.

32:43.760 --> 32:48.760
You get a seasonal recipe, the pre-proportioned ingredient, all that stuff.

32:48.760 --> 33:03.760
Outcoming meals include sauteed shrimp and green beans with globe tomatoes, spinach and orzo pasta, miso butter, salmon and lo mein noodles with cucumber and charmed tomatoes, whole grain pasta and summer vegetables with heirloom tomato caprese salad.

33:03.760 --> 33:04.760
That's it.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.760
They don't just send you regular ass tomatoes.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.760
They got globe tomatoes, charred tomatoes and heirloom tomatoes.

33:08.760 --> 33:11.760
Like these sounds like World of Warcraft loot.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.760
These tomatoes.

33:12.760 --> 33:13.760
Yeah, I fucking love it.

33:13.760 --> 33:24.760
Hashtag tomatoes, hashtag delicious, hashtag meals, hashtag cook, hashtag blue, hashtag the, hashtag pre-proportioned.

33:24.760 --> 33:33.760
So you can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals free with free shipping by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

33:33.760 --> 33:34.760
That's a great deal.

33:34.760 --> 33:40.760
That's three meals free with free shipping by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

33:40.760 --> 33:44.760
Or the most easier to remember, blapron.com.

33:44.760 --> 33:45.760
Blapron.com.

33:45.760 --> 33:46.760
Blapron.com.

33:46.760 --> 33:47.760
Oh my God, Justin.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.760
Hashtag blapron.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.760
Blapron.com is an old one that's been in effect for a while.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.760
Is it?

33:52.760 --> 33:53.760
Yeah.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.760
Okay, again.

33:54.760 --> 33:55.760
You can use blapron.com.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.760
Blapron.

33:56.760 --> 33:57.760
A better way to cook.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.760
Griffin.

33:58.760 --> 33:59.760
Yeah.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.760
Tell me about Moon 2.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.760
Yeah, I'm going to tell you all about Moon 2.

34:02.760 --> 34:09.760
Moon 2 is an electronic art pop band and they got a new album out that you can give a listen to at moon2.bandcamp.com.

34:09.760 --> 34:16.760
Now that is moon, spelled the way like the celestial body, dash ii.

34:16.760 --> 34:19.760
So moon-ii.bandcamp.com.

34:19.760 --> 34:26.760
Moon 2 is an electronic art pop band who recently released their debut album, Lily Nobody.

34:26.760 --> 34:32.760
It's got burning synths and swirling backgrounds and songs about love, copycats, and dysphoria too.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.760
It's a beautiful, this is a quote.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.760
And sometimes folks do this in this industry.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.760
If you're looking for a pull quote for a thing, something you're going to put out on the album cover.

34:41.760 --> 34:45.760
Sometimes you send it to the people that you want to say it and you're just like, how's this spin you?

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
And it spins me just right.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.760
I'll go ahead and put my brand on this one.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.760
It's a beautiful, haunted doll of an album.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.760
That's in McElroy.

34:53.760 --> 34:58.760
That's moon-ii.bandcamp.com.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.760
Go check it out.

35:01.760 --> 35:02.760
Is Bandcamp the one that's shutting?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.760
No, SoundCloud is the one that's going to shut down soon.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.760
Fuck, that makes me so sad.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.760
I don't want to think about that.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.760
I'm going to go listen to the good jams at moon-ii.bandcamp.com.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.760
I want to read this next message so very badly.

35:13.760 --> 35:14.760
All right, go.

35:14.760 --> 35:19.760
This message is for Sam and maybe Brian, and it's from Brian.

35:19.760 --> 35:24.760
And the message says, Sam, hopefully we're still dating by the time the brothers read this message.

35:24.760 --> 35:25.760
I love you.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.760
Probably even more now than when I first wrote this.

35:28.760 --> 35:32.760
If we're married by then, congratulations from past Brian.

35:32.760 --> 35:37.760
Note to Brian, if Sam dumped you, hang in there, brother. I love you.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.760
So this started covering all of the bases.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.760
How long ago did you write this, Brian?

35:44.760 --> 35:46.760
Another note to Brian.

35:46.760 --> 35:52.760
If you were killed in a terrible passion and are now a Spectre, I'm coming for all of you.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.760
Boo.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.760
One additional note to Brian.

35:56.760 --> 36:02.760
If you got drafted into a secret government agency, you can continue to see your loved ones,

36:02.760 --> 36:06.760
but it will have to be from afar because their memories of you have been erased.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.760
They have been men in black just sort of flashed out of there.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.760
Yeah.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.760
Are you sad and confused about world politics?

36:13.760 --> 36:15.760
Worried about the upcoming inevitable nuclear war?

36:15.760 --> 36:17.760
Or maybe a rat is living in your house.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.760
There's a rat living in my house.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.760
How do you get rid of a rat from a house?

36:20.760 --> 36:24.760
Why not immerse yourself in a completely fictional imagined podcast for the beef and dairy industries?

36:24.760 --> 36:25.760
It works for me.

36:25.760 --> 36:29.760
The Beef and Dairy Network podcast is the number one podcast for those involved

36:29.760 --> 36:33.760
or just interested in the production of beef animals and dairy herds.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.760
Don't worry, it's funnier than it sounds.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.760
Find us at beefanddairynetwork.com or maximumfun.org

36:38.760 --> 36:40.760
or wherever you get your podcasts from.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.760
Oh, God, there's the rat. Oh, God.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.760
How about a Yahoo?

36:46.760 --> 36:47.760
Yes.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.760
God, I got some fucking good ones. I have three very good ones.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.760
Yeah, how about this one?

36:53.760 --> 36:55.760
This Yahoo was sent in by Seth Carlson.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.760
Thank you, Seth Carlson, for your good, good work.

36:57.760 --> 36:58.760
It's from Yahoo Answers User.

36:58.760 --> 36:59.760
Great.

36:59.760 --> 37:05.760
Dirk, who has 0% best answers, try harder, Dirk.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.760
Dirk asks, how many of my own mozzarella sticks

37:09.760 --> 37:12.760
do you think I can bring into Applebee's before they get suspicious?

37:12.760 --> 37:18.760
I really, really like riblets and motz sticks.

37:18.760 --> 37:21.760
Motz? Oh, mozzarella sticks.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.760
But they are way too expensive.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.760
Tell me about it. In this economy?

37:26.760 --> 37:28.760
I was figuring I can warm them up beforehand

37:28.760 --> 37:32.760
and just sneak them in in my shirt pocket and maybe back pocket.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.760
Only one. Got to have my wallet, you know.

37:34.760 --> 37:38.760
But I think they might... Hey, shh.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.760
But I think they might notice if I start eating them.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.760
Can I be arrested?

37:43.760 --> 37:45.760
This is... I...

37:45.760 --> 37:46.760
Shh, shh, shh.

37:46.760 --> 37:47.760
Listen, I want to...

37:47.760 --> 37:48.760
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.760
I know what you want me to do, and that's play with you.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.760
Play with me in my playhouse.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.760
This question is not from a human being.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.760
Play with me in the space.

37:58.760 --> 38:03.760
Yo, look at all my toys, my wonderful toys and games.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.760
Let me tell you why this isn't real.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.760
If you think about all the pocket opportunities,

38:08.760 --> 38:11.760
the opportunities that you have throughout your clothing,

38:11.760 --> 38:16.760
shirt pocket and back pants pocket are the least mozzarella stick friendly.

38:16.760 --> 38:22.760
I've got so many toys and games in my space. Play with me.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.760
Carry a satchel.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.760
Think how many mod sticks you can get in a satchel,

38:25.760 --> 38:27.760
then order your own plate of mod sticks.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.760
It is going to take some investment upfront for this grift.

38:30.760 --> 38:34.760
As any good grift does, you're going to have to spend a little to make a lot.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.760
Yahoo Answers user Jim says,

38:39.760 --> 38:41.760
Dirk the troll at it again.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.760
Get out of my... We're getting out of my...

38:43.760 --> 38:46.760
Dirk, you've been uninvited from my game space.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.760
I'd take your toys and games and leave.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.760
I don't want to play with you anymore.

38:50.760 --> 38:51.760
I'm closing the message.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.760
Seth Carlson, keep your head on a swivel, okay?

38:54.760 --> 38:55.760
Because there's grifters everywhere.

38:55.760 --> 38:58.760
You just lost your nickname, Seth.

38:58.760 --> 39:02.760
I was going to call you Seth Carl Dab and you've lost it.

39:02.760 --> 39:07.760
Here's a Yahoo from Travis Washable.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.760
Great name. Thank you, Travis.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.760
It's from Yahoo Answers user Jess.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.760
Who has 5% best answers?

39:12.760 --> 39:17.760
How do you eat tacos in class without getting yelled at?

39:17.760 --> 39:19.760
Okay.

39:19.760 --> 39:20.760
Play with me?

39:20.760 --> 39:22.760
Are you guys going to play with me in this one?

39:22.760 --> 39:23.760
This one might be real.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.760
Yeah.

39:24.760 --> 39:28.760
I do think that this is among the worst foods you could eat in class.

39:28.760 --> 39:33.760
Because one, stinky if you're doing it right and you know what I mean.

39:33.760 --> 39:34.760
Secondly...

39:34.760 --> 39:36.760
I don't know what you... Stinky?

39:36.760 --> 39:37.760
Just like the zesty...

39:37.760 --> 39:39.760
A lot of sense.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.760
I will say if it's a zesty...

39:41.760 --> 39:44.760
Zesty ground beef is like...

39:44.760 --> 39:45.760
That is potent.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.760
It definitely is an overwhelming flavor.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.760
If you have some powerful cilantro in there, sometimes that...

39:51.760 --> 39:52.760
And some people don't...

39:52.760 --> 39:53.760
Can't jam on cilantro.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.760
Stinky is not the word I would use though.

39:55.760 --> 39:56.760
Aromatic.

39:56.760 --> 39:57.760
Once again, Griffin.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.760
Justin started some bullet points.

39:59.760 --> 40:03.760
You have to let him get to the second bullet point or my brain's going to melt.

40:03.760 --> 40:04.760
Give it.

40:04.760 --> 40:05.760
My brain's going to melt.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.760
My bullet points were...

40:07.760 --> 40:08.760
What was I talking about?

40:08.760 --> 40:11.760
You said the reasons tacos were wrong to eat in class.

40:11.760 --> 40:12.760
One, stinky.

40:12.760 --> 40:13.760
Two, go.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.760
Two, messy.

40:14.760 --> 40:15.760
So obvious.

40:15.760 --> 40:16.760
Oh yeah.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.760
You're going to get some grease dribble, no question.

40:18.760 --> 40:19.760
But moreover...

40:19.760 --> 40:21.760
That's what your Trapper Keeper is for, by the way.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.760
No one's ever finished a taco and been like, well, it's on my stomach.

40:24.760 --> 40:25.760
Ever.

40:25.760 --> 40:29.760
It's almost always 25% just like on the paper.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.760
And you could make it into a cone and then put the end of the cone in your mouth.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.760
And taco cone the way...

40:35.760 --> 40:36.760
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:36.760 --> 40:37.760
I just came up with a great idea.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.760
Yeah.

40:38.760 --> 40:39.760
We'll come back to that.

40:39.760 --> 40:40.760
Yeah.

40:40.760 --> 40:41.760
Super quick.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.760
Taco cone.

40:42.760 --> 40:46.760
Start wrapping hard shell tacos in square flour tortillas.

40:46.760 --> 40:51.760
So when the taco leavings fall there, you don't have a mess.

40:51.760 --> 40:52.760
You have another taco.

40:52.760 --> 40:53.760
A second one.

40:53.760 --> 40:54.760
Yeah.

40:54.760 --> 40:55.760
That's good shit.

40:55.760 --> 40:56.760
Yeah.

40:56.760 --> 40:57.760
It's really good.

40:57.760 --> 40:58.760
So...

40:58.760 --> 40:59.760
Yeah.

40:59.760 --> 41:00.760
I'm sorry.

41:00.760 --> 41:01.760
Are we assuming hard shell taco, by the way?

41:01.760 --> 41:02.760
Because soft taco would be really good.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.760
No.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.760
I'm going to roll that out.

41:04.760 --> 41:05.760
Yeah.

41:05.760 --> 41:06.760
It's got to be.

41:06.760 --> 41:11.640
I get made fun of a lot because I live in Texas and I say the word shell when referring

41:11.640 --> 41:13.440
to a tortilla.

41:13.440 --> 41:20.440
And I think it might be a soda or pop thing or maybe just like a McElroy.

41:20.440 --> 41:25.520
I don't know if this is a wider thing that people say, like a wider sort of use case,

41:25.520 --> 41:29.580
but nobody calls them shells except for me sometimes.

41:29.580 --> 41:32.000
And I've tried to work it out in my system, but...

41:32.000 --> 41:33.320
Hashtag shell truth.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.320
Jesus God.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.320
Thank you, Jesus.

41:35.320 --> 41:39.600
I want to play with everybody in this space, but I got to read this response from Todd.

41:39.600 --> 41:45.960
Todd, Jesus, Todd has 33,319 answers on this platform.

41:45.960 --> 41:48.160
Damn, this is a smart guy, huh?

41:48.160 --> 41:49.160
Yeah.

41:49.160 --> 41:50.160
He knows everything.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.160
Well, if Todd...

41:51.160 --> 41:52.160
Okay.

41:52.160 --> 41:55.360
You're trying to make me believe in Todd, but if Todd's real, how's he get to all those

41:55.360 --> 41:56.840
answers in one night?

41:56.840 --> 42:00.280
You know what I mean?

42:00.280 --> 42:01.280
I'm sorry.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.280
I got to math this out.

42:02.280 --> 42:07.040
He's been a member since November 6th, 2009.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.680
Okay.

42:08.680 --> 42:15.200
So here in a couple months, that will have been eight years.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.200
That's 96 months.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.200
Two, nine, two, zero, and then 33,319.

42:19.200 --> 42:28.380
I listened to that podcast, you told me to shh, shh, shh.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.340
Don't do this to me right now.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.120
For about 30 seconds, they just did math.

42:33.120 --> 42:37.120
That's 11.4 answers every day, Todd.

42:37.120 --> 42:38.120
Damn, Todd.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.120
Todd, damn.

42:39.120 --> 42:43.760
He's like, are you a professional Yahoo's answerer?

42:43.760 --> 42:47.920
Hey, Todd, damn.

42:47.920 --> 42:51.480
I don't learn 11 things a day.

42:51.480 --> 42:55.200
I can't keep up that rate of learning.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.280
I don't know how he's spouting this stuff off.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.280
Okay, Todd, though, Todd.

42:59.280 --> 43:02.560
My Todd says- We can only get six an episode.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.560
Yeah, I know.

43:03.560 --> 43:04.560
Wow.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.000
Todd says, make sure you do it in home ec.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.920
In normal class, you simply can't.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.480
Tacos have a strong aroma usually.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.480
Damn, Todd.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.040
That's actually pretty good.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.280
That's actually a pretty good answer, Todd.

43:15.280 --> 43:16.280
Damn.

43:16.280 --> 43:17.280
Damn, Todd.

43:17.280 --> 43:19.600
Todd, the fucking info wizard.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.280
Are they all heaters?

43:21.280 --> 43:25.800
Is Todd bringing this kind of fire every single time he steps up to the plate 11 times a day?

43:25.800 --> 43:26.800
Careful.

43:26.800 --> 43:27.800
You might fall into a Todd hole.

43:27.800 --> 43:28.800
Be careful.

43:28.800 --> 43:29.800
You might fall into this Todd hole.

43:29.800 --> 43:30.800
No, Griffin.

43:30.800 --> 43:32.680
I'm free diving into the Todd.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.120
Where's the egg in an egg roll?

43:34.120 --> 43:35.840
There are eggs in the wrapper dough.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.320
Damn, Todd.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.320
Todd.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.320
Damn.

43:39.320 --> 43:45.800
A baguette, brie pate, and a bottle of champagne under the Eiffel Tower or a shepherd's pie,

43:45.800 --> 43:48.760
pint of Guinness on the banks of the River Thames.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.200
Leave the brie and pate out and it sounds great.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.200
So a little humor.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.200
Oh, Todd.

43:53.200 --> 43:56.000
He's bringing, but also culture.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.480
It's humor, but also culture.

43:57.480 --> 43:58.480
I love that.

43:58.480 --> 44:01.800
Which handed ice hockey stick should I use if I'm ambidextrous?

44:01.800 --> 44:05.880
Pick the arm that has the most forearm strength to hold the back of the stick.

44:05.880 --> 44:09.200
What doesn't Todd know about?

44:09.200 --> 44:14.080
Food, hockey, get Todd a Mr. Wizard style show.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.440
Two treats.

44:15.440 --> 44:16.960
What are your favorite TV shows?

44:16.960 --> 44:21.760
NCIS, Bob's Burgers, Modern Family, Beat Bobby Flay, Chopped Iron Chef.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.320
I watch History Channel and others, but no specific favorite shows.

44:25.320 --> 44:26.320
Damn.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.800
Todd, he's a man of culture.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.800
Todd.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.800
Wow.

44:30.800 --> 44:31.800
What does-

44:31.800 --> 44:33.800
Todd, damn it.

44:33.800 --> 44:34.800
Okay.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.240
I'm feeling so into Todd right now, I feel like we're just one away from...

44:38.240 --> 44:41.000
So what are some of your guys' favorite races of people?

44:41.000 --> 44:44.560
Oh no, Todd, no.

44:44.560 --> 44:45.920
So eating tacos in class.

44:45.920 --> 44:51.320
If there's old timey desks where you lift up the top to stow your belongings underneath,

44:51.320 --> 44:57.840
that my friend is a taco privacy curtain that you can use to sort of keep yourself away

44:57.840 --> 45:00.440
from the prying eyes of teach.

45:00.440 --> 45:04.600
Now you gotta watch your flanks, because you could have jealous students.

45:04.600 --> 45:09.400
I'm sorry, I'm not anybody to yuck anybody's yum or put anybody on blast, but if I see

45:09.400 --> 45:17.280
one of my fellow pups chowing down on some tacos in class, the jealousy will be so powerful

45:17.280 --> 45:24.160
as such that I will shout and scream like I was in fucking Invasion of the Body Snatchers,

45:24.160 --> 45:28.280
just like my mouth held open while a ghastly whale comes out of my mouth as I point at

45:28.280 --> 45:32.920
him with a crooked finger, until the teach comes and takes the tacos away.

45:32.920 --> 45:36.000
Because if I can't have them, can't nobody have them.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.800
Can the teach legally confiscate the tacos?

45:38.800 --> 45:43.280
I don't know, and I know in a public school system for sure, I don't know if once I get

45:43.280 --> 45:48.880
to a college level, like I'm an adult, like you can't just steal my tacos.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.240
You don't own this room, I do as a taxpayer.

45:51.240 --> 45:55.720
Well not only that, but if you confiscate tacos, you only got two options, like you're

45:55.720 --> 46:01.760
not gonna pull your desk drawer open at the end of the year and return his tacos to him.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.160
Did you bring the Ziploc bag I instructed you to?

46:04.160 --> 46:08.600
Okay, open up, I have your taco swap.

46:08.600 --> 46:12.880
You had a good year Bill, enjoy these tacos, you've earned them.

46:12.880 --> 46:19.000
Mr. Pilsen, after we investigated the taco situation, obviously you're fired, that's

46:19.000 --> 46:20.760
not up for debate.

46:20.760 --> 46:21.920
Should I clean out my desk?

46:21.920 --> 46:25.560
No, you absolutely should not clean out your desk, we burned your desk.

46:25.560 --> 46:27.680
You please, never teach again.

46:27.680 --> 46:30.320
My taco savings.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.280
Now what am I supposed to retire with?

46:32.280 --> 46:36.320
This is what you do, you take the taco for the student break and then you're like, alright

46:36.320 --> 46:41.360
everybody you know what this means, taco auction, let's go.

46:41.360 --> 46:44.360
The highest bidder gets to eat this taco.

46:44.360 --> 46:47.200
Oh man.

46:47.200 --> 46:52.720
What's with the consistent use of those green desk lamps, Todd says, they're like in every

46:52.720 --> 46:55.880
movie and TV show, does it have to do with camera lighting?

46:55.880 --> 47:01.720
So there's a little bit of like, you know, he knows a lot of stuff but he's still poking

47:01.720 --> 47:05.480
around this world of ours, scraping up answers.

47:05.480 --> 47:06.480
I love it.

47:06.480 --> 47:09.720
And you know the second somebody responds to that, he's gonna find another thread where

47:09.720 --> 47:14.720
he could just be like, actually, it's camera lighting, I know all about it.

47:14.720 --> 47:15.720
Todd.

47:15.720 --> 47:16.720
Todd.

47:16.720 --> 47:17.720
Todd.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.240
Any ideas from Todd?

47:20.240 --> 47:25.960
Man, what a treasure, I'm glad he's out there like, actually putting some wisdom into this

47:25.960 --> 47:29.360
world unlike ourselves, he should be doing this podcast instead of us really.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.360
Let's get Todd up on it.

47:30.360 --> 47:33.480
Todd if you're listening, get at us.

47:33.480 --> 47:37.240
I was raised in a household in which the air conditioning was a special privilege only

47:37.240 --> 47:46.120
switched on during very hot days, never at night, all days and never set below 78 degrees.

47:46.120 --> 47:55.720
This saves money and is more eco-friendly, yeah, I know, I currently live with four roommates

47:55.720 --> 48:00.360
who insist on blasting the AC at 72 all day and all night, hell yeah, I live for that

48:00.360 --> 48:01.360
shit.

48:01.360 --> 48:04.880
I'm freezing my ass off and also paying an exorbitant share of our electric bill.

48:04.880 --> 48:08.560
But I convinced my roomies to give the refrigeration a rest.

48:08.560 --> 48:14.240
That's from Chile and California, I don't know, speaking just for like the Huntington

48:14.240 --> 48:16.240
McElroy household, you kind of know the fucking place.

48:16.240 --> 48:22.720
Yeah, Justin keeps his like the fucking snow fox exhibit at a local zoo, like his shit

48:22.720 --> 48:23.720
is frigid.

48:23.720 --> 48:30.960
I've been watching Smallville, spoilers, Fortress of Solitude, and it looks so fucking

48:30.960 --> 48:34.800
chilly in there, I look at that and I'm like, yeah, that sounds nice.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.000
I want to live in that.

48:37.000 --> 48:42.560
You share a fucking hotel room with Justin, you wake up like fucking Jack Torrance at

48:42.560 --> 48:45.680
the end of The Shining, like it's a real situation.

48:45.680 --> 48:54.200
Now I will say, you're supposed to keep nursery temperatures for a baby like between 68 and

48:54.200 --> 49:00.520
72, which for a non-baby who isn't wearing a big fun sleep snuggie, it's a little on

49:00.520 --> 49:01.520
the cold side.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.000
It's a little bit on the chilly side.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.480
I keep it at 68 at night because that's the temperature I like to sleep at, and I sleep

49:07.480 --> 49:08.480
in the nude.

49:08.480 --> 49:09.880
So what do you want from me?

49:09.880 --> 49:11.160
I can't do more.

49:11.160 --> 49:14.280
Oh, I have an answer for that.

49:14.280 --> 49:17.720
What I want from you is to not know what you said just then.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.600
I want you to go back in time and not tell me.

49:20.600 --> 49:24.440
Let's rewind to the bit where we talk about having machete and home intruders.

49:24.440 --> 49:29.120
It is pre-established canon, my bim bam canon, that I sleep in the nude.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.280
This isn't a surprise.

49:30.280 --> 49:32.440
I've revealed this on the program before.

49:32.440 --> 49:36.840
I block it out every time, so it is a surprise each time you say it, and now I'm going to

49:36.840 --> 49:41.800
have to go through intensive work to shut that out, close that door in my mind one more

49:41.800 --> 49:42.800
time.

49:42.800 --> 49:47.200
I've got this cool hook that I can get up in my brain that I just find the data.

49:47.200 --> 49:48.200
Like a little recall?

49:48.200 --> 49:51.200
Just pull it out your nose?

49:51.200 --> 49:55.160
Yeah, it's tough.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
Here's the thing, though.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
Here's what I like about it.

49:57.160 --> 50:05.320
Is in these fucking dog days, I can wear long ass sweatpants and a hoodie and like all my

50:05.320 --> 50:11.020
comfy jam jams, all my wintertime buddies, my off-court winter buddies.

50:11.020 --> 50:12.020
So that's nice.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.840
I mean, you should celebrate that.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.480
The exorbitant share about the electric bill, I don't know what to tell you because those

50:16.480 --> 50:21.120
dog days sure, oof, because my electric bill is barking during these dog days.

50:21.120 --> 50:22.320
The answer is easy.

50:22.320 --> 50:26.500
The answer is easy, and I'll tell you why it's easy, because you got an even number

50:26.500 --> 50:31.840
between the two numbers, 78, 62, set it at 75.

50:31.840 --> 50:37.080
It becomes a problem if the difference was an odd number because then you're going to

50:37.080 --> 50:41.160
fight over that degree.

50:41.160 --> 50:46.520
So you're saying, let's agree to meet me in the middle.

50:46.520 --> 50:50.480
But they live with four roommates who all want 72.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.800
So you're going to get 73 at best.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.960
73 seems like that would be a great.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.000
Why don't you start at 73 and just be like, how does everybody feel about this?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.400
Like boiling a frog.

51:00.400 --> 51:01.960
What?

51:01.960 --> 51:07.960
Like boiling a frog, you start how to boil frog, you start with cold water and then slowly

51:07.960 --> 51:08.960
increase the heat.

51:08.960 --> 51:11.080
You got to slowly boil your roommates.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.800
Why do you want to do that to a frog?

51:12.800 --> 51:13.800
Why would you do that to a frog?

51:13.800 --> 51:14.800
You don't.

51:14.800 --> 51:15.800
It's a saying.

51:15.800 --> 51:16.800
It's a saying of like-

51:16.800 --> 51:17.800
It's a fucking horrible saying.

51:17.800 --> 51:18.800
Yeah.

51:18.800 --> 51:19.800
You having any other cool animal tortures, Trev?

51:19.800 --> 51:20.800
No, I'm-

51:20.800 --> 51:21.800
It's just like-

51:21.800 --> 51:23.160
I'm not, I'm not endorsing it.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.800
Just like punching a cow.

51:24.800 --> 51:25.800
Why would you punch a-

51:25.800 --> 51:27.560
More than one way to skin a cat.

51:27.560 --> 51:28.560
Get the fuck out.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.560
Oh, God.

51:29.560 --> 51:30.800
God almighty.

51:30.800 --> 51:31.800
I didn't make it up.

51:31.800 --> 51:32.800
You don't want to skin cats.

51:32.800 --> 51:33.800
But if you do-

51:33.800 --> 51:34.800
You do apparently.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.800
You love it.

51:35.800 --> 51:36.800
Travis, you're saying it's your favorite shit.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.800
There's just different ways.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.360
No, there's just different ways to do it.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.600
There's 27 ways to skin a cat.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.560
Cats are, cats are nature's cousins.

51:43.560 --> 51:44.560
Cats.

51:44.560 --> 51:45.560
Okay.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.560
Cats are nature's cats.

51:46.560 --> 51:47.560
Cats are nature's cats.

51:47.560 --> 51:48.560
Why would you want to skin them?

51:48.560 --> 51:49.560
Don't touch them.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.240
Travis, don't ever touch my cat again.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.240
I don't want to see-

51:52.240 --> 51:53.240
Burned in the hand, two in the bush.

51:53.240 --> 51:54.460
Is that better?

51:54.460 --> 51:56.880
Why are you throwing birds into a bush at each other?

51:56.880 --> 51:59.160
Like angry birds, you fucking animal.

51:59.160 --> 52:01.240
Kill a bird, two birds with one stone.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.240
Why would you do that?

52:02.240 --> 52:03.240
Why?

52:03.240 --> 52:05.240
Why are you throwing rocks at birds, you fucking wild dog?

52:05.240 --> 52:06.240
Just let it fly.

52:06.240 --> 52:08.240
Let it fly away.

52:08.240 --> 52:11.100
We are very violent towards animals in our sayings.

52:11.100 --> 52:12.840
And I'm only now just realizing that.

52:12.840 --> 52:13.840
Seems that way.

52:13.840 --> 52:14.840
Yeah.

52:14.840 --> 52:15.840
Oh, no.

52:15.840 --> 52:16.840
Seems that way.

52:16.840 --> 52:17.840
Why are we skinning cats?

52:17.840 --> 52:18.840
Why are we doing rocks at birds?

52:18.840 --> 52:19.840
Why are we getting cats and boiling frogs and-

52:19.840 --> 52:20.840
Hey, save a horse, ride a cowboy.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.440
That one's good for animals.

52:22.440 --> 52:23.680
That's a nice one.

52:23.680 --> 52:24.680
That's my favorite-

52:24.680 --> 52:26.160
Let the cat out of the bag?

52:26.160 --> 52:27.160
Yeah.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.520
Yeah, you should, probably.

52:28.520 --> 52:34.000
That's my favorite proverb from Proverbs is save a horse, ride a cowboy, Proverbs 1010.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.680
For every horse you save, you save two of your own, as I've always said, you know?

52:38.680 --> 52:42.320
Save your neighbor's horse, get two horses in return.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.320
There's an elephant in the room.

52:43.320 --> 52:44.320
We'll let him out, goshdarnit.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.320
Yeah.

52:45.320 --> 52:46.320
Let him out of the room.

52:46.320 --> 52:51.280
Elephants don't believe, unless it's an elephant room where the scale is such that the elephant

52:51.280 --> 52:56.520
doesn't feel restricted in any way, and it's an outdoor room because that's what elephants

52:56.520 --> 52:57.520
prefer.

52:57.520 --> 53:01.000
The sad thing about that is you can let him out of the room, but he's always gonna remember

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
when he was in the room.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
Oh, yeah.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
That's a real shame.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
He's never gonna let that go.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.440
Hey, a stitch in time strangles a giraffe.

53:09.440 --> 53:10.440
I hate these.

53:10.440 --> 53:11.440
I hate these idioms.

53:11.440 --> 53:14.640
I think Benjamin Franklin was a big, weird pervert, maybe.

53:14.640 --> 53:15.840
No, he was.

53:15.840 --> 53:17.800
He was a bloodthirsty killer.

53:17.800 --> 53:18.800
Okay.

53:18.800 --> 53:19.800
Mm-hmm.

53:19.800 --> 53:23.160
But he created bifocals so he could look at twice as many dead animals.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.160
Did you know that?

53:24.160 --> 53:25.160
Jeez, bitch.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.160
Yeah, that's true.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.840
That's why he started the post office, so he could mail dead animals to himself.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.000
He had that beard.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.040
He got that electricity key, and he was like, I can't wait to touch this up against a moose

53:35.040 --> 53:37.800
or something and see if I can make it explode a new way.

53:37.800 --> 53:43.120
He tied a key to a kite and the other end of the key to a chinchilla that he had, and

53:43.120 --> 53:45.760
it's like, ugh, weird.

53:45.760 --> 53:47.720
What a bad man.

53:47.720 --> 53:48.720
Yeah.

53:48.720 --> 53:54.440
We never talk about that aspect, but Ben Franklin is the fucking worst.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.600
Where's Todd when we needed to hear about that?

53:56.600 --> 53:57.600
Yeah, Todd.

53:57.600 --> 54:00.040
Where was Todd when we needed to hear about what?

54:00.040 --> 54:04.120
Well, Justin, do you see the footprints in the sand and there's only one set?

54:04.120 --> 54:05.120
Yeah.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.440
That's when Todd carried you.

54:06.440 --> 54:07.440
Through-

54:07.440 --> 54:08.440
Well, through what?

54:08.440 --> 54:09.440
I don't know that that applies.

54:09.440 --> 54:10.440
Well, he picked you up.

54:10.440 --> 54:13.600
He carried you over the information about Benjamin Franklin you needed to know.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.400
Oh, like Jesus does with evolution.

54:15.400 --> 54:16.400
Yeah, like-

54:16.400 --> 54:17.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, come with me.

54:17.400 --> 54:18.400
Whoa, you don't-

54:18.400 --> 54:19.400
Look over there.

54:19.400 --> 54:20.400
You don't need to-

54:20.400 --> 54:22.280
Let me just go ahead and carry you past this.

54:22.280 --> 54:24.160
You don't need to deal with any of this.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.160
Let's-

54:25.160 --> 54:26.160
Folks, that's going to do it for us-

54:26.160 --> 54:28.120
End the show.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.880
That's the end of the show this week.

54:29.880 --> 54:38.120
We hope you've had fun and enjoyed yourself, and we, let's see, we're doing some shows

54:38.120 --> 54:39.120
out on the road.

54:39.120 --> 54:44.280
If you go to mcelroyshows.com forward slash tours, you can see the shows we got lined

54:44.280 --> 54:45.280
up.

54:45.280 --> 54:51.960
Some things are sold out, but we've still got some seats in Atlanta and Nashville and

54:51.960 --> 54:54.640
maybe a few in Brooklyn for this September.

54:54.640 --> 54:57.040
Has Milwaukee woken the fuck up yet?

54:57.040 --> 54:58.040
No.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.040
Milwaukee's still snoozing.

54:59.040 --> 55:00.760
Chicago, you're almost sold out.

55:00.760 --> 55:01.760
Minneapolis, I think, is-

55:01.760 --> 55:04.160
No, Chicago is sold out, so we don't have that one anymore.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.160
Jesus Christ.

55:05.160 --> 55:06.160
Are you kidding me?

55:06.160 --> 55:10.240
Yeah, that Chicago theater is actually a very big theater, so I think that's kind of wild.

55:10.240 --> 55:15.200
But Minneapolis and Milwaukee, we still got some tickets for you, especially Milwaukee.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.200
Come on.

55:16.200 --> 55:17.200
Milwaukee?

55:17.200 --> 55:20.080
Come on, get some friends together to come see this show.

55:20.080 --> 55:23.560
I'm on November 19th, I get it, but-

55:23.560 --> 55:26.000
A little bit of a plug.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.040
Well, let's see, a couple things.

55:29.040 --> 55:33.920
One, my wife, Teresa, and I are going to be on the JoCo Cruise this year, the Jonathan

55:33.920 --> 55:36.240
Colton Cruise, coming in February 2018.

55:36.240 --> 55:45.160
They just announced us, so you can go to JoCoCruise, J-O-C-O Cruise dot com, and book your cab

55:45.160 --> 55:49.200
and stuff now, and come hang out with us on a cruise ship, along with a lot of awesome

55:49.200 --> 55:56.520
cool people like Pat Rothfuss, Gene Gray, Iron Mike Eagle, Sean Hodgman, Amy Mann, and

55:56.520 --> 55:58.560
a whole bunch of others.

55:58.560 --> 56:04.640
Also, I'm going to be on the JV Club podcast with Janet Varney this week that comes out

56:04.640 --> 56:05.640
on Thursday.

56:05.640 --> 56:06.640
Oh, great.

56:06.640 --> 56:09.160
I mean, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

56:09.160 --> 56:11.200
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:11.200 --> 56:16.880
It's a really, really great song and a really great record, and I don't know, go get it

56:16.880 --> 56:20.040
and go get all the other Long Winters albums, because they're fucking fantastic.

56:20.040 --> 56:21.820
Oh, I have one more little plug.

56:21.820 --> 56:26.500
My wife and I do a media rewatch podcast called The Kind Rewind.

56:26.500 --> 56:31.000
We just started watching Firefly, so if you would like to hear us talk about Firefly,

56:31.000 --> 56:35.920
or if you've never watched it before and want to watch along with us, we put out the first

56:35.920 --> 56:39.920
Firefly episode where we just watched the pilot and talked about, that's a really good

56:39.920 --> 56:40.920
pilot.

56:40.920 --> 56:42.800
So go check that out.

56:42.800 --> 56:46.320
We have other shows also at McElroyShows.com, and you can check out all the shows on the

56:46.320 --> 56:49.760
Maximum Fun Network at MaximumFun.org, because there's a lot of really great stuff there.

56:49.760 --> 56:51.420
How about that final?

56:51.420 --> 56:52.420
Bring us home.

56:52.420 --> 56:54.440
Here's that final from Jason Roundtree.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.440
Thank you, Jason.

56:55.440 --> 56:56.480
A couple other folks sent this in, too.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.480
Thank you all.

56:57.480 --> 56:58.480
It's from Yahoo!

56:58.480 --> 56:59.480
And it's usurred.

56:59.480 --> 57:00.480
Oh, no.

57:00.480 --> 57:01.480
Oh, no.

57:01.480 --> 57:02.480
Oh, God, no.

57:02.480 --> 57:03.480
Is it Todd?

57:03.480 --> 57:04.480
It's Dirk.

57:04.480 --> 57:05.480
Oh.

57:05.480 --> 57:06.480
Oh, God.

57:06.480 --> 57:09.480
Dirk is the evil Todd.

57:09.480 --> 57:14.000
I got to do it, because I don't know.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.840
I'm sorry you have to read it, but I'm not going to laugh at it.

57:16.840 --> 57:17.840
This will be our first song.

57:17.840 --> 57:18.840
Nobody laugh.

57:18.840 --> 57:20.120
Nobody laugh at it.

57:20.120 --> 57:24.120
Do I have to form the meat into the shape of a steak, or does it do that on its own

57:24.120 --> 57:25.120
in the pan?

57:25.120 --> 57:26.120
I'm crying.

57:26.120 --> 57:27.120
He caught me.

57:27.120 --> 57:28.120
He caught me.

57:28.120 --> 57:29.120
He caught me.

57:29.120 --> 57:30.120
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:30.120 --> 57:31.120
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:31.120 --> 57:32.120
I'm sorry, Todd.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.120
Damn it.

57:33.120 --> 57:34.120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.120
Sorry, Todd.

57:35.120 --> 57:36.120
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.120
Kiss your death square on the lips.

57:37.120 --> 57:54.800

Together, we host a podcast called Still Buffering, where we answer questions like, why should

58:12.000 --> 58:14.240
I not fall asleep first at a slumber party?

58:14.240 --> 58:15.240
How do I be fleet?

58:15.240 --> 58:18.600
Is it okay to break up with someone using emojis?

58:18.600 --> 58:20.200
And sometimes we talk about butts.

58:20.200 --> 58:22.000
No, we don't.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Nope.

58:23.000 --> 58:28.780

58:35.640 --> 58:38.880
Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.
