00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.400 --> 00:54.720
era, as if we never left. It's your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. It's your middle-est

00:54.720 --> 00:58.720
brother and responsible homeowner, Travis McElroy. It's your sweet baby brother and 30

00:58.720 --> 01:02.480
under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy, and I do just need to point out that we did leave

01:02.480 --> 01:09.200
for like a month. We left for a grip. So long as we've gone without recording

01:09.200 --> 01:13.600
on My Brother, My Brother, and Me since April 2010 when the show launched, I believe.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.120
And there are a lot of reasons for that. Travis is now a proud homeowner,

01:17.120 --> 01:25.440
and I'm very excited about that. I had diarrhea for like two weeks, and I died on the Oregon trail,

01:25.440 --> 01:37.840
and Justin's just been exploring his body. I finally got my middle school body,

01:37.840 --> 01:45.040
and I'm exploring all the different hair that I have now. Just so everybody knows,

01:45.600 --> 01:51.760
as we're doing more live shows and stuff, the situation going forward will not be that we'll

01:51.760 --> 01:57.200
just dump them all at once. We did hope to keep some of this in the coffer. It's just life gets

01:57.200 --> 01:59.440
in the way. It was literally a bad situation for a month.

01:59.440 --> 02:05.760
Just a bad situation. So we're here with you now. I wanted to tell some exciting news.

02:06.320 --> 02:11.840
This past weekend at the Charleston West Virginia Clay Center for Performing Arts,

02:11.840 --> 02:21.760
I saw PJ Masks' live stage show live in concert. Is PJ Masks one person?

02:21.760 --> 02:25.440
Good question. I don't know anything about what you're saying.

02:25.440 --> 02:32.720
PJ Masks is a superhero team. This is a show on Disney Junior. PJ Masks is a superhero team

02:32.720 --> 02:43.680
of three kids. Catboy, there's Gekko, and there's Owlette. They are regular kids who,

02:43.680 --> 02:49.360
in the nighttime, transform into superheroes via their magical pajamas.

02:49.360 --> 02:54.560
Okay, so this teaches kids like, don't go to sleep. Party all night. You get superpowers.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.560
Go out and fight crime. Don't worry about going to sleep, little baby. Get on out there.

02:58.560 --> 03:05.360
Now, Justin, this is all new to me. This is a very important question I have.

03:05.920 --> 03:14.720
These kids, when they fight crime, is the crime like, we lost the basketball. Where is it? Or is

03:14.720 --> 03:18.720
it like, somebody's been kidnapped and we gotta go beat up some bad guys?

03:18.720 --> 03:23.280
And follow up question, do they have a sort of self-imposed Batman-esque moral code where

03:23.280 --> 03:29.440
they do not kill the bad guys? Good question. They only punch and beat them up very badly, but

03:29.440 --> 03:35.280
the PJ Masks kids never kill. How many people do they hang off the sides of buildings?

03:35.280 --> 03:42.160
Important question, all. So PJ Masks, you two have hit upon, I think,

03:42.800 --> 03:49.360
the most interesting parts of bringing PJ Masks live to the stage.

03:49.360 --> 03:56.080
They do kill. They do kill, huh? They don't actually usually do anything.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.440
The PJ Masks have superheroes, but of course there's never any punching, right?

04:01.440 --> 04:04.960
When you bring this, this is a show where the episodes, of course, are like

04:05.760 --> 04:10.800
like any kids show, they're like, you know, 11 minutes long. 45 seconds long, yeah.

04:10.800 --> 04:16.800
Yeah, it's like 11 minutes long. This fucking show kicked off at

04:16.800 --> 04:23.280
3 p.m. and they can't do any- They can't do anything.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.280
They can't do anything. They can't fight.

04:25.280 --> 04:30.000
They have, their costumes have, it's like 20-somethings playing the kids,

04:30.000 --> 04:35.040
but their costumes have these large misshapen heads to replicate the experience of

04:36.400 --> 04:39.040
them being kids, I guess, to give them that kid look.

04:39.760 --> 04:44.960
And they can't do, like there's no pyrotechnics, there's no flying, obviously.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.480
So Owlette just sort of like runs around with her wings.

04:48.480 --> 04:53.920
And like literally half the things in this show were her flapping her wings so hard

04:53.920 --> 04:57.920
that she blew bad people off the stage. Gekko, who has super strength,

04:59.200 --> 05:03.440
as near as I can tell, only uses super strength to strike things from the stage

05:03.440 --> 05:06.560
that no longer needed to be included in the episode.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.680
It was Gekko wearing a black turtleneck and black slacks,

05:09.680 --> 05:11.760
and was he maybe just the stage manager?

05:11.760 --> 05:14.960
And he took lots of breaks and came back smelling like cigarettes.

05:14.960 --> 05:19.040
Gekko, there's another one with the sticky splats, and he would pick it up

05:19.040 --> 05:21.920
and he would throw it stage right just to keep the show,

05:21.920 --> 05:23.840
we just have to keep the action moving.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.000
And- Well, he couldn't do more than that, he's Union.

05:26.640 --> 05:31.760
The three villains like claimed a playground for their own,

05:31.760 --> 05:34.160
and the PJ Masks were like not down with that.

05:34.160 --> 05:38.160
And then the villains decided that they should team up for once.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.480
Thank you for finally realizing that.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.640
And their first order of business was to steal the PJ Masks headquarters,

05:44.640 --> 05:46.640
which seems like a pretty big ass for your first show.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.000
It's a good crime.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.080
Yeah, it's a really good crime.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.680
Anyway, they can't attack each other, literally they can't.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.240
And there's no like things moving on the stage

05:57.040 --> 05:59.040
because it's a pretty simple touring production.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.960
So it's literally just kids like running around and flapping wings

06:02.960 --> 06:04.720
and then throwing things off the stage.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.920
It got to be 350 and there was a magnificent battle

06:09.920 --> 06:12.720
by which I mean Catboy ran around in circles

06:12.720 --> 06:15.920
and Owlf flapped her wings at people and Gekko struck the stage.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.840
Climactic battle between the three and then the lights went down

06:19.840 --> 06:20.880
and a voice said,

06:21.760 --> 06:24.480
all right, kids, we're gonna take a 20 minute intermission

06:24.480 --> 06:25.760
and then we'll be back.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.760
Are you fu- How could there be more?

06:29.760 --> 06:33.760
They were tearing chairs in half, they were ripping nameplates off.

06:33.760 --> 06:38.800
I'm sorry, Dr. Robert Lingan who bought this chair.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.400
Gave his life for this theater.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.840
A beam fell on him, we love him.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.920
A kid is just eating the carpet.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.240
They run us, they go us.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.960
This motherfucker was literally an hour and 45 minutes long.

06:52.960 --> 06:57.680
This show barely maintains its narrative momentum for 11 minutes

06:57.680 --> 07:01.920
and you're gonna stretch this shit over an hour and 45 minutes long.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.280
The last- How many parents do you think, Justin,

07:05.280 --> 07:07.600
like the kids went out into the lobby

07:07.600 --> 07:08.880
and the kids are like, what's going on?

07:08.880 --> 07:10.400
And the parents like, that's the end.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.600
Intermission's a fancy word for it's done.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.320
It's Latin for go on home, Jeremy.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.120
I will say at least one third of this podcast tried it.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.080
For sure, for sure.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.000
Oh, we're done, sweetie.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.920
And here's, and get this, because it's like a fancy schmancy place,

07:27.920 --> 07:30.720
you can't bring drinks or snacks into the theater.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.880
So what you had was kids had been bought sodas,

07:34.880 --> 07:37.360
were told they couldn't bring them into the theater

07:37.360 --> 07:40.240
and then just stood outside before act two,

07:40.240 --> 07:42.960
just pounding soda and sugar

07:42.960 --> 07:45.280
and then putting them back in for act two.

07:45.280 --> 07:50.640
By the end of this show, the mass exodus and hysteria

07:50.640 --> 07:53.760
was as if the PJ Masks had suddenly started doing

07:53.760 --> 07:56.080
like deeply racist material.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.680
Just like shouting at people, people walking out,

07:59.680 --> 08:02.880
kids just like, one kid had a conch shell

08:02.880 --> 08:04.400
and another kid killed him for it.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.560
It was fucking pandemonium.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.440
And what kills me is like,

08:10.880 --> 08:13.440
who did you make this two hours for?

08:13.440 --> 08:16.960
Who was your target in making this a two hour long production?

08:16.960 --> 08:18.720
Because it certainly wasn't the parents.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.280
I could have showed up and just taken a picture with the PJ Masks

08:21.280 --> 08:23.040
and feel like I had done my duty.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.840
It wasn't the kids, they want this shit to be 15 minutes long

08:25.840 --> 08:29.200
and that's barely, like that's hanging by a thread

08:29.200 --> 08:30.560
and you're gonna make it two hours long.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.160
It's for the performers, Justin,

08:32.160 --> 08:34.240
so they can really stretch their chops.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.280
Who is Catboy?

08:37.280 --> 08:39.600
It may be the only time they let them off the bus,

08:39.600 --> 08:41.840
so maybe it's like a humanitarian thing.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.200
Like we do have to give them two hours.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.720
You watch them walk up the stage,

08:46.720 --> 08:48.880
they do the curtain call, they do a bow

08:48.880 --> 08:50.480
and then as they're walking off the stage,

08:50.480 --> 08:52.560
you can actually see them putting the shackles

08:52.560 --> 08:54.000
back around their neck.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.840
As the sheep dogs start herding them.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.800
Yep, yep, back on the bus, yep, back on the bus, yep.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.360
Anyway, PJ Masks were pretty good.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.400
This is, as you've almost certainly guessed by now,

09:04.400 --> 09:08.080
this is an advice show where we take your questions

09:09.120 --> 09:12.480
and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.400
Again, really sorry about the absence.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.800
It's not gonna be a recurring thing,

09:16.800 --> 09:17.680
it's just been a rough.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.720
I hear it makes the heart grow fonder.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.720
And it makes the download counts go down,

09:24.720 --> 09:26.720
much very down, very, very down.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.720
So please download the show a bunch of times,

09:28.720 --> 09:29.440
tell your friends.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.280
I recently attended a symposium at a large opera house

09:33.280 --> 09:34.240
in Denver.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.560
As the lights dimmed and the PJ Masks began

09:36.560 --> 09:40.800
to take the stage, I heard an odd scrubbing sound

09:40.800 --> 09:44.000
on my left and turn to see the person next to me

09:44.000 --> 09:46.960
was brushing her teeth.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.400
She was using a full-sized toothbrush

09:50.400 --> 09:52.800
with no toothpaste that I could see

09:52.800 --> 09:55.520
and she was brushing very actively.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.480
Well, you got to.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.080
And making a lot of noise.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.040
After a few minutes, she threw her toothbrush loose

10:01.680 --> 10:04.240
into her purse, turned to me and said,

10:04.240 --> 10:05.920
I really thought I was late to this,

10:05.920 --> 10:07.600
but I guess I was just on time.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.000
I was speechless and I just stared at her.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.520
What would have been the appropriate response

10:13.520 --> 10:16.160
to this heinous opera crime?

10:17.360 --> 10:20.640
This is, is there an appropriate time for you

10:20.640 --> 10:22.960
to brush your teeth at an opera house?

10:23.920 --> 10:27.680
If you had gotten there early, does that justify it?

10:27.680 --> 10:29.360
Certainly being on time or late,

10:29.360 --> 10:30.880
neither of those is acceptable.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.360
Toothbrushing like, oh, oh, sorry, excuse me,

10:33.360 --> 10:34.800
excuse me, what did I miss?

10:36.320 --> 10:38.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.800
It's not a time thing, it's a place thing

10:40.800 --> 10:42.480
because you can't brush your teeth at the opera

10:42.480 --> 10:45.280
or outside of your house bathroom only.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.440
I would also, I would pause it

10:47.440 --> 10:50.160
that while all of this is very upsetting,

10:51.040 --> 10:55.840
I'm in some ways very glad she was brushing very actively

10:55.840 --> 10:58.400
because I think it would be way stranger

10:58.400 --> 11:01.440
if she was brushing very lackadaisically.

11:01.440 --> 11:01.920
Yeah, sure.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.600
Very lazily brushing, just shh, shh.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.400
Yeah, gingivitis ain't nothing to fuck with

11:08.400 --> 11:10.640
and I get that and if you're gonna go to town,

11:10.640 --> 11:12.000
if you're gonna brush your teeth in public,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.280
you may as well get the job done.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.600
If you're gonna go to town, you may as well go into Lincoln.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.920
I get it, but I don't get it

11:17.920 --> 11:19.360
because you're outside your house bathroom

11:19.360 --> 11:21.040
and that's where the toothbrush lives.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.800
I think toothbrushes should have

11:22.800 --> 11:24.400
those little electric dog collars on them,

11:24.400 --> 11:26.000
but facing outwards or if you do try

11:26.000 --> 11:27.600
to leave your house bathroom for it.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.200
I see people in the bathroom at the airport

11:29.200 --> 11:30.160
brushing their teeth and it's like,

11:30.160 --> 11:33.840
you couldn't wait, maybe the big job interview, maybe, okay.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.840
Those might be midnight riders though, Griffin.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.880
Those people might-

11:36.880 --> 11:39.360
You get a red eye, that can feel pretty humanizing.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.920
They've only touched ground twice in a month.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.920
You should have to get a permit from,

11:43.920 --> 11:45.840
I had to do the TSA pre-check

11:45.840 --> 11:49.920
and I think there should also be a TSA toothbrush okay

11:49.920 --> 11:52.800
outside the airport, go for a free hall pass.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.840
It's a cloak, right?

11:53.840 --> 11:55.040
It's definitely a cloak.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.120
You caught me, it's a Buckwild cloak,

11:57.120 --> 11:58.240
but it's a cloak all the same.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.840
You caught me brushing my teeth in this room

12:01.840 --> 12:04.000
and that's how late I was.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.680
That's what a rush I was in

12:05.680 --> 12:07.280
that I couldn't brush my teeth at home,

12:07.280 --> 12:08.080
so I had to brush them.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.840
You're suggesting they always carry a toothbrush

12:09.840 --> 12:10.720
so that if they're late for a thing

12:10.720 --> 12:12.800
they run into the big meeting like, shh, shh, shh.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.320
Sorry guys, it's one of those mornings,

12:14.320 --> 12:15.680
my fucking kid stole my car.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.760
No, I'm in no way suggesting what you're saying.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.520
That's a good strat.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.400
You've done it again.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.800
That's a pro strat, I'm very into that.

12:24.800 --> 12:28.480
Bring Mr. Matthews, you're late for first period again.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.280
Shiki, shiki, shiki.

12:29.280 --> 12:34.960
I know man, fucking, the little one stole my car again

12:34.960 --> 12:36.560
and my backpack died.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.440
I think this is what I, okay,

12:41.440 --> 12:43.200
because I think this falls in the same category.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.040
You remember in cartoons and TV shows

12:45.040 --> 12:46.800
to signify someone was late,

12:46.800 --> 12:48.960
they had like an electric razor in the car?

12:49.840 --> 12:50.080
Yeah.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.800
Has anyone ever fucking really done that?

12:52.800 --> 12:53.120
Probably.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.360
If I was driving and I looked over

12:55.360 --> 12:59.280
and saw somebody in the car to my left shaving their,

12:59.280 --> 13:01.360
I would park by the side of the road

13:01.360 --> 13:04.400
and wait half an hour to make sure that person was gone.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.000
Citizen's arrest, absolutely.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.360
I do have to pause it.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.040
There is a possibility, I think,

13:09.920 --> 13:12.080
and hopefully this will help guide you.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.760
There's a possibility I think that this person maybe,

13:15.760 --> 13:17.120
we don't know their journey,

13:17.120 --> 13:21.120
but perhaps they are living with obsessive compulsive disorder,

13:21.120 --> 13:24.640
in which case excessive grooming, as I understand,

13:24.640 --> 13:26.640
can be a component of that.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.280
Sure.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.880
And in which case, I would say,

13:29.600 --> 13:32.720
maybe just let people have their fucking journey.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.920
You know what I mean?

13:33.920 --> 13:36.000
When you see people who are doing things

13:36.000 --> 13:37.120
a little bit out of the norm,

13:37.120 --> 13:38.800
maybe just what you gotta start thinking is like-

13:38.800 --> 13:39.840
Respect the journey.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.200
Respect that journey.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.400
2018, respect the journey.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.160
Okay, I can get behind that.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.120
I do want to say though,

13:47.120 --> 13:50.720
the one element of this though to go against that

13:50.720 --> 13:54.080
was just throwing the toothbrush loose in the purse.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.600
Yeah, that's probably, I don't know.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.440
If this person did this on a regular basis,

13:57.440 --> 13:58.560
they would have like-

13:58.560 --> 14:00.400
A special thing that they could travel.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.680
A travel case would make sense.

14:01.680 --> 14:02.480
A holster.

14:02.480 --> 14:02.720
Yeah.

14:03.920 --> 14:04.320
Yeah.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.440
Like a bandolier like John Popper has of harmonicas

14:07.440 --> 14:08.400
with toothbrushes just-

14:10.000 --> 14:12.640
I'm not trying to project obsessive compulsive disorder

14:12.640 --> 14:13.360
onto this person.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.640
What I'm saying is like,

14:14.640 --> 14:17.520
if you listening at home, if that's your fucking journey,

14:17.520 --> 14:18.800
own your journey.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.360
Respect the journey.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.080
Damn, that's good.

14:22.720 --> 14:23.440
How about a Yahoo?

14:24.240 --> 14:24.480
Okay.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.280
This Yahoo was sent in by the deliveryman Seth Carlson.

14:27.280 --> 14:27.760
Thank you, Seth.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.520
It's the Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

14:29.520 --> 14:33.120
We're gonna call him Marcus asks,

14:34.720 --> 14:39.040
is it awkward for actors and actresses to do kissing scenes?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.880
Oh, the kissing scene though.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.920
Oh, no.

14:45.920 --> 14:50.720
Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, last day of shooting.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.200
You had me at hello.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.640
Happy New Year's.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.520
Get over here.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.160
And then they put their faces close

14:58.720 --> 15:01.280
and Billy kind of grimaces and Meg looks a little,

15:01.280 --> 15:03.760
she starts sweating and the director's like,

15:04.320 --> 15:07.920
stop, you did such a good job delivering the lines,

15:07.920 --> 15:09.520
but where's the smooch?

15:09.520 --> 15:10.480
Real quick side journey.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.080
Can I tell you why when Harry Met Sally

15:12.080 --> 15:12.960
is a fucked up movie?

15:13.920 --> 15:15.280
I mean, I guess so.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.360
As long as it doesn't derail the great momentum

15:17.360 --> 15:18.080
I was building there.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.760
Now we'll come right back to your momentum.

15:19.760 --> 15:20.800
Pin momentum.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.520
Not how momentum works.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.680
Pin momentum pinned.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.880
In when Harry Met Sally, at the beginning of the movie,

15:29.680 --> 15:32.240
Harry posits that men and women can't be friends

15:32.240 --> 15:34.080
without wanting to sleep together.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.560
And then Harry and Sally become friends

15:36.560 --> 15:39.280
and then they sleep together and enter a romantic relationship.

15:39.280 --> 15:43.600
Incorrect, because their friendship takes on new levels

15:43.600 --> 15:46.640
and depth and spice over time

15:47.520 --> 15:49.040
when they are no longer lovers.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.280
Their friendship persists despite the fact

15:51.280 --> 15:52.720
that they are no longer lovers.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.920
And that is what is so beautiful

15:53.920 --> 15:55.520
about the story of when Harry Met Sally.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.600
You missed the whole point.

15:57.600 --> 16:01.600
But then they end up in a romantic relationship, Justin.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.400
No, Travis, I'm sorry, you burnt.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.040
Moving on to the next Rob Reiner film, North.

16:07.040 --> 16:11.520
Now, okay, so mistakes were made.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.880
They probably lean in, Billy and Meg,

16:16.880 --> 16:20.800
and it's just like, it was always you, kid,

16:20.800 --> 16:23.280
and then you lean in and then they just start laughing

16:23.280 --> 16:24.320
because it's funny.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.600
This is a stranger.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.600
I've worked along Billy for a few months now

16:29.600 --> 16:31.760
while we've made this romantic film.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.200
Wait, you, Griffin?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.280
Yeah, I've worked, I mean, we did some work together

16:35.280 --> 16:37.440
and we did have that one very passionate kiss

16:37.440 --> 16:39.040
in City Slickers 1.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.480
And I just leaned into Billy, lips a puckered,

16:42.480 --> 16:44.400
and I was ready because I keep it professional.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.640
I wanted to get the job done, go back to my trailer,

16:50.400 --> 16:52.320
and I just leaned in and me and Billy

16:52.320 --> 16:54.560
just started just corpsing right there.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.840
Couldn't stop cackling because it's funny.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.080
I don't know you, but we have to kiss?

17:00.080 --> 17:02.080
What a weird job this is.

17:02.080 --> 17:05.280
You know what I bet is also weird

17:05.280 --> 17:07.360
when it happens in the smooching scenes?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.840
Like you've been doing the scene, right?

17:09.840 --> 17:11.360
And it's like, oh, it's so dramatic.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.040
Oh, the passion, I can feel it.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.520
And then they go into kiss and it's just like, meh.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.080
You know what I mean?

17:16.080 --> 17:16.640
Like, they just kiss weird.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.760
Definitely, there's got to be actors who's bad kissing.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.400
Who's bad kissing.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.280
Right, and it's just like, and you're the director, right?

17:23.280 --> 17:25.760
And maybe you're also like, well, you're not a tourist.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.600
You're the director, maybe director of photography too.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.200
You did it all, you wrote the script,

17:29.200 --> 17:31.680
and you're watching it and you're like, yes, yes,

17:31.680 --> 17:32.160
this is it.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.520
And then they just kind of like do that thing

17:33.520 --> 17:35.040
where it's like, they just kind of catch the corner

17:35.040 --> 17:37.120
of each other's mouths and maybe their noses bump

17:37.120 --> 17:38.400
and you're like, oh.

17:38.400 --> 17:42.160
Now what you don't realize, a lot of these movies these days,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
they just get Andy Serkis in there.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.040
So for instance, Ashton Kutcher doesn't know,

17:49.040 --> 17:53.040
never learned how to kiss, never really did it.

17:53.040 --> 17:58.480
And so in 70s show and in Fuck Buddies

17:58.480 --> 18:02.320
and his great show, The Ranch that everybody loves

18:02.320 --> 18:04.560
on Netflix, anytime he has to do a kiss scene,

18:04.560 --> 18:07.520
a two and a half man, the later college years,

18:08.800 --> 18:12.000
just Andy Serkis, they would call cut, one frame,

18:12.640 --> 18:13.600
you would look over and be like,

18:13.600 --> 18:14.880
did he get a little bit shorter?

18:15.440 --> 18:18.160
And also did you get a complete digital recreation

18:18.160 --> 18:19.520
of A plus K?

18:20.320 --> 18:21.680
And now they have the technology

18:21.680 --> 18:24.000
that they can have Andy Serkis kiss Andy Serkis.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.680
And he's good at it, he's good at kissing himself.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.880
And a lot of people don't know this,

18:28.880 --> 18:30.800
but their racist pistachio commercial,

18:30.800 --> 18:34.080
that was Andy, that was Andy doing Ashton.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.360
So it's time to forgive, I think it was Andy doing Ashton.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.120
I think there is very little more pleasurable to me

18:41.120 --> 18:45.520
than the idea of Ashton's about to kiss his leading lady

18:46.320 --> 18:49.440
and then cut so Ashton can go put on

18:49.440 --> 18:52.800
his crazy black lycra suit with the white balls all over it

18:52.800 --> 18:54.560
just to make sure we get the capture

18:55.360 --> 18:56.880
exactly right for the body.

18:56.880 --> 19:00.320
And then Andy Serkis is looking over his shoulder

19:00.320 --> 19:04.160
with a smaller black lycra on his face that is mapped

19:04.160 --> 19:06.800
and he's sort of modeling the actions.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.040
So it's Ashton's body being captured,

19:09.040 --> 19:12.080
but Andy Serkis' face handling the actual smooch.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.400
And he just, he parts his lips

19:14.400 --> 19:17.920
the scientifically perfect number of millimeter.

19:17.920 --> 19:21.440
Like it is mouth moisture, perfect moisture,

19:21.440 --> 19:22.960
and Andy Serkis' perfect CGI mouth.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.560
And the nice thing about it

19:24.560 --> 19:28.080
is that it leaves Ashton's face available

19:28.080 --> 19:30.080
so that he can tweet with his nose.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.640
He has his assistant reach up

19:32.640 --> 19:36.720
and lets him peck out a couple of good ones on there.

19:37.680 --> 19:38.960
And they just put the iPad

19:38.960 --> 19:41.200
right in front of the person's face too.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.200
So you know what, here's the thing.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.600
If you're on set, you look at it and you're like,

19:45.600 --> 19:47.360
I don't see how this would ever come together.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.400
And really who this comes down to, it's those techs.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.000
You know, and this is why I'm saying

19:52.000 --> 19:55.600
we have to keep the technical Oscars going.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.440
We have to keep them going.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.360
Respect the techs, respect the journey.

19:59.920 --> 20:03.280
I think that Andy Serkis

20:04.240 --> 20:06.240
basically has been troned at this point.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.200
I think he has been transcendent at this point.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.000
And I think he is entirely a digital construct

20:12.000 --> 20:13.200
at this point to discuss.

20:14.960 --> 20:15.460
Yes.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.120
Do you think that the greatest technical achievement

20:19.120 --> 20:22.720
in the 2018 Oscars will be if they can recreate

20:22.720 --> 20:25.200
the Wild Things three-way kiss all Andy Serkis?

20:25.200 --> 20:26.320
All Andy Serkis?

20:32.560 --> 20:34.080
Justin, how about another question?

20:34.080 --> 20:37.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.680
So I got a new joke.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.440
Just a full remake of The Notebook

20:41.440 --> 20:42.880
with him playing both roles.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.720
If you're a bird, I'm a bird.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.600
I'm Andy Serkis.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.480
He's playing young and old both sets.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.160
Let's die at the same time.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.280
I'm Andy Serkis.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.560
His Benjamin Button was really good

20:54.560 --> 20:57.200
because it's like, this is the easiest gig I've ever had.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.040
Do it around me.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.920
In some ways, it's actually kind of sad

21:01.920 --> 21:05.200
because Andy Serkis has single-handedly put out of work

21:05.760 --> 21:08.720
every actor in the world.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.920
Yeah, it's just him.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.480
Because he has lawnmower manned himself throughout all of-

21:14.480 --> 21:15.920
Lawnmower man, it's a great example.

21:15.920 --> 21:16.960
I should have used earlier.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.640
Justin, how about another question?

21:19.760 --> 21:21.360
Here's looking at you, Andy.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.040
Thank you, Andy.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.000
Very kind.

21:24.960 --> 21:28.720
And the Oscar for best actor goes to me again.

21:28.720 --> 21:29.520
Thank you, me.

21:29.520 --> 21:30.720
You're welcome, Andy.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.600
I'd like to thank all of me.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.640
Do you motherfuckers remember

21:32.640 --> 21:35.680
when Gollum presented an Oscar at the Oscars?

21:35.680 --> 21:36.720
Oh shit, dude.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.280
That actually did life beat us to that joke.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.440
How are we all not always talking about the fact

21:43.440 --> 21:45.760
that Gollum presented at the Oscars?

21:45.760 --> 21:47.680
How is that not our every day?

21:47.680 --> 21:49.600
Somebody watched the Kids' Choice Awards

21:49.600 --> 21:51.120
and saw Bart Simpson give one out

21:51.120 --> 21:52.080
and said, I'd like to do that

21:52.080 --> 21:53.920
for the highest acting honor in the land.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.680
Has Shrek and Donkey presented at the-

21:57.680 --> 22:00.000
Shrek and Donkey have definitely done that.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.840
Shrek at the Vibe Awards was a kind of a landmark moment.

22:05.840 --> 22:13.280
So I got a new job.

22:13.280 --> 22:16.080
I got a new job fucking Andy Serkis.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.240
I'm keeping all the Cable-Ace Awards this year.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.200
I've got a new job,

22:23.200 --> 22:25.120
but it's been an excellent transition so far.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.160
The pay is better.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.520
It's a 20 minute commute

22:27.520 --> 22:29.360
and my favorite restaurant is down the street.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.040
There's just this one little thing.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.520
My new boss is a really nice, fun guy

22:33.520 --> 22:34.880
who I mostly get along with,

22:34.880 --> 22:37.200
except it came up in conversation

22:37.200 --> 22:38.960
that I had been mugged

22:38.960 --> 22:41.440
and he thought that was the funniest thing in the world.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.000
So he keeps popping out at me

22:44.000 --> 22:46.080
and shouting, ah, don't get jacked

22:46.080 --> 22:47.200
and running up behind me,

22:47.200 --> 22:49.200
telling me to stick him up and give me the goods.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.760
It's alarming to say the least.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.120
What should I do, boyos?

22:55.120 --> 22:57.840
That's from Just A Cool Kid Employed Dangerously.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.600
That ain't good.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.080
That sucks in a major way

23:02.080 --> 23:05.040
because that shit will fuck you up, man.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.400
Like, that's no good.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.360
That's a really bad.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.880
That's a, that is a,

23:09.920 --> 23:11.840
I mean, it sounds like you enjoy it.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.520
I get, oh, it says alarming.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.560
I thought it said amazing.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.080
Okay, so it's alarming to say the least.

23:16.080 --> 23:16.960
Yeah, it's not good.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.160
It's a bad behavior.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.640
I think the good solution for this

23:20.640 --> 23:21.840
is next time he tries it,

23:22.480 --> 23:24.720
throw him your wallet and piss your pants.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.760
I thought you were going to say

23:25.760 --> 23:27.760
what I was going to say when you said throw

23:27.760 --> 23:29.360
because I was going to say like throw him,

23:29.360 --> 23:30.480
like judo throw him.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.520
In fact, I'm so sorry.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.360
I've trained myself as a human weapon

23:33.360 --> 23:36.000
so that this could never happen again.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.680
I actually like Justin's better.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.840
Or just throw him into a garbage can

23:39.840 --> 23:42.160
where it sounds like maybe he belongs,

23:42.160 --> 23:42.720
which is right there in the garbage.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.440
But he's a nice, fun guy, Griffin.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.680
My impulse is to tell people

23:47.680 --> 23:49.200
something we've been kind of on,

23:49.840 --> 23:51.920
I think since about 350 or so,

23:51.920 --> 23:54.480
which is like, just fucking tell him.

23:55.120 --> 23:55.760
Don't do that.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.280
But when I realized that,

23:57.280 --> 23:59.040
when I realized you'd be telling your boss like,

23:59.040 --> 24:00.560
hey, don't mug me,

24:00.560 --> 24:02.720
which you shouldn't have to tell people

24:02.720 --> 24:03.840
not to mug you.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.840
Can you pay your dad to dress up as Batman

24:07.840 --> 24:09.760
and hide in the ceiling tiles?

24:09.760 --> 24:13.520
Because I think just one time of him pulling this

24:13.520 --> 24:15.840
and then your dad falls through the ceiling

24:15.840 --> 24:19.360
with like that triumphant Tim Burton music behind him

24:19.360 --> 24:21.520
and just like takes your boss out.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.080
Yeah.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.040
I feel like that would be-

24:23.040 --> 24:24.800
Sorry, false alarm.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.080
Sorry, but it's hard to discern.

24:28.080 --> 24:32.320
My computer algorithm doesn't catch sarcastic mugging.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.760
I've been sensing a lot of muggings in this area of late.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.960
Because who does that?

24:36.960 --> 24:38.400
Who does sarcastic mugging?

24:38.400 --> 24:39.680
You fucking jag.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.760
I'm Batman.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.560
I cuss now.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.360
Now get back to collating or whatever.

24:45.360 --> 24:45.920
Bye.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
I've never worked a real job.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.760
Could you actually bring a smoke bomb with you?

24:50.480 --> 24:52.480
Could you actually bring a smoke bomb with you?

24:52.480 --> 24:54.080
So your boss goes to mug you and you're like,

24:54.080 --> 24:55.440
oh yeah, let me just grab this out of my...

24:56.160 --> 24:56.720
Done.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.280
Gone.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.000
Where is he?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.040
He's not working today.

24:59.040 --> 24:59.920
That's for sure.

24:59.920 --> 25:00.640
And why?

25:00.640 --> 25:02.080
Because you tried to mug him.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.880
So good luck explaining that to the higher ups.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.800
Why Dylan isn't at work today.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.080
Because I tried to mug him.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.120
Or talk to HR.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.520
That should be another go-to piece of advice

25:11.520 --> 25:12.640
that we start incorporating,

25:12.640 --> 25:14.080
which is there's a fucking...

25:14.080 --> 25:15.520
There's a person you talk to

25:15.520 --> 25:18.000
about complicated social stuff like this.

25:18.000 --> 25:18.480
Okay.

25:18.480 --> 25:18.880
Okay.

25:18.880 --> 25:19.840
Yes, Griffin.

25:19.840 --> 25:24.240
But like that implies that there's a way

25:24.240 --> 25:25.760
to handle this anonymously.

25:25.760 --> 25:30.800
So you go to HR and they send out a company-wide email.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.000
We've had some issue with fake mugging

25:34.000 --> 25:36.560
in the office of if you know anybody

25:36.560 --> 25:38.560
that has done fake mugging on Dylan.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.120
No specific examples.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.400
We've just heard there's been a bit of a trend.

25:44.960 --> 25:45.440
Yeah.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.200
It's kind of caught on lately.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.360
You may have been reading some headlines recently

25:49.360 --> 25:51.600
about fake muggings in the office.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.040
Just want to let you know this behavior

25:53.040 --> 25:56.160
that will not be tolerated is against our corporate spirit.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.320
Should we go to the money zone?

25:58.320 --> 25:59.920
I forget how to get there, Griffin.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.480
Show me the way.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.520
It's just the seconds.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.040
Okay.

26:05.040 --> 26:05.680
We'll do your thing.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.760
I was going to do like a second star on the right

26:07.760 --> 26:08.160
and fly straight to home.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.360
No, please keep going.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.240
I thought my favorite...

26:10.240 --> 26:11.920
It's one of my favorite stick songs.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.160
Show me the way.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.480
Show me the...

26:18.480 --> 26:19.200
Oh, you know what?

26:19.200 --> 26:20.800
You know why I know that song by heart

26:20.800 --> 26:22.720
is because one time at Christian camp,

26:22.720 --> 26:24.960
we had to choreograph a song to it about Jesus.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.840
Oh!

26:25.840 --> 26:27.040
Oh, really?

26:27.040 --> 26:28.080
Oh, yeah.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.120
Oh, really?

26:29.120 --> 26:32.640
It was a pantomime to that Stix's show me the way

26:32.640 --> 26:34.480
except there was a Jesus and they...

26:35.200 --> 26:37.120
There was a Jesus.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.200
And they seem very proud of themselves

26:39.200 --> 26:40.720
for using secular music.

26:40.720 --> 26:43.200
Like, you know, like you kids like Stix.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.040
Oh, was this like the guy who did the Weird Al style parody

26:47.040 --> 26:49.920
of walking in Memphis, but walking with Jesus?

26:49.920 --> 26:51.360
Walking with Jesus.

26:51.360 --> 26:55.920
I don't think Weird Al works with that particular palette.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.480
I don't think that's a color that he paints with.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.200
Did we already talk about walking with Jesus?

27:01.200 --> 27:02.240
Definitely no.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.200
It had the worst perversion,

27:05.200 --> 27:07.360
like the worst parody perversion of a line.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.320
I've never heard my entire life.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.080
I guess parody is not technically accurate,

27:10.080 --> 27:12.560
but anyway, repurposed secular music

27:12.560 --> 27:14.240
for Christianity's purposes.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.800
This cat put in this lyric.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.160
She said,

27:18.160 --> 27:21.440
Son, are you a Christian child? And I said,

27:21.440 --> 27:23.600
Ma'am, I am for life.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.240
Can you not?

27:24.960 --> 27:29.680
Can you not ruin one of the best fucking lines in any song

27:29.680 --> 27:32.160
with that, like, that's please.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.120
So here come those commercials.

27:35.120 --> 27:49.440
My Brother, My Brother, Me is sponsored in part by Casper,

27:49.440 --> 27:52.160
which is an online retailer of premium,

27:52.160 --> 27:56.320
obsessively engineered mattresses for a fraction of the price.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.000
We have a Casper in our home.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.520
Travis, do you sleep on a Casper?

28:00.160 --> 28:01.200
I do.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.320
I actually have two.

28:02.320 --> 28:06.080
I got Casper in the guest room and a Casper in my bedroom.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.920
Casper has a risk-free trial and return policy.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.920
You can try sleeping on one for a hundred days.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.360
And if you don't like it, there's painless returns,

28:15.360 --> 28:16.640
but you're gonna like it.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.320
And Casper mattresses feature supportive memory foam

28:20.320 --> 28:23.840
for a sleep surface that's got just the right sink

28:23.840 --> 28:25.280
and just the right bounce.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.520
And they're already really affordable,

28:27.520 --> 28:30.640
but, but, but they get even more affordable

28:30.640 --> 28:32.160
if you're a listener of ours.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.800
You can get $50 towards any mattress purchase

28:34.800 --> 28:38.000
by going to Casper.com slash My Brother

28:38.000 --> 28:40.240
and use the promo code My Brother,

28:40.240 --> 28:42.160
that's all one word, at checkout.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.280
Terms and conditions apply.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.120
I want to tell you all about Wink.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.800
That's W-I-N-C.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.080
They are a retailer of good, good wine,

28:51.040 --> 28:55.280
which I enjoy that beverage of wine,

28:55.280 --> 28:57.920
which is French for the old grapes,

28:57.920 --> 28:59.280
but I don't know anything about wine.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.680
I can barely tell a red from a white.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.320
I can't tell a Chiraz from a Chardonnay,

29:04.320 --> 29:06.720
but I know that if I go to trywink.com,

29:06.720 --> 29:08.560
it's T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com,

29:08.560 --> 29:11.200
and I answer a few questions about what I find tasty,

29:11.200 --> 29:14.320
their recommendation engine will pick distinct

29:14.320 --> 29:16.480
and interesting wines customized to my taste

29:16.480 --> 29:18.320
to be shipped directly to my door every month.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.880
And I used the, the my pronoun there a lot,

29:20.880 --> 29:22.880
but it'll work for you the same way too.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.400
Our recommendation engine, by the way,

29:24.400 --> 29:25.920
is powered by Andy Serkis,

29:25.920 --> 29:28.720
who is inside of all of our machines.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.240
So that's very exciting.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.880
Do you like earthen flavor notes?

29:32.880 --> 29:35.360
Why did we decide that he sounds like that?

29:35.360 --> 29:36.640
I don't know.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.280
Wink will even introduce you to new, rare,

29:39.280 --> 29:42.320
and custom wines that are not available anywhere else.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.640
We've gotten a bunch of bottles of Wink wine,

29:44.640 --> 29:47.200
and it's just like, it's nice having wine around the house

29:47.200 --> 29:48.160
for when people come over,

29:48.160 --> 29:50.480
or I cook a fancy dinner or something,

29:50.480 --> 29:52.400
and they've all been really tasty.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.280
There's no membership fees.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.120
You can skip any month you want and cancel any time,

29:55.120 --> 29:57.120
and they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee,

29:57.120 --> 29:58.960
so you never pay for a bottle you don't like.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.640
And right now, Wink is offering listeners

30:00.640 --> 30:01.840
$20 off your first order

30:01.840 --> 30:03.680
when you go to trywink.com slash my brother.

30:03.680 --> 30:07.920
That's trywink, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother

30:07.920 --> 30:09.840
to get $20 off your first order now.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.440
Trywink.com slash my brother.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.920
I have a personal message here for Allison.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.520
It's from Daniel, and it says,

30:19.520 --> 30:22.800
happy 24th birthday, honeybee.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.520
I sure hope you still listen to this podcast.

30:25.520 --> 30:33.760
I heard they did like a month of live shows.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.880
That must've been harrowing.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.000
I don't blame you for bouncing.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.720
Being apart has been tough,

30:38.720 --> 30:40.720
but listening to these soft, sweet boys

30:40.720 --> 30:42.800
has helped shorten the distance between us.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.520
I know we'll always be on the same wavelength.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.920
All my love, Fluffbutt.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.760
Now it is worth noting that October 8th.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.800
Okay, that's not that far.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.440
Oh my God.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.680
I read October 8th, and I thought,

30:55.680 --> 30:58.240
man, that's like six or seven months away.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.280
Hachi-machi.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.160
Nah, that's next.

31:00.160 --> 31:01.200
That's the next week.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.560
That's next week.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.200
I got a message for Daniel from Hannah.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.120
Whoa, wait, do you think it's the same Daniel?

31:07.120 --> 31:07.760
Hold on.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.840
Hold on, okay, Daniel.

31:10.640 --> 31:11.280
All right.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.360
My sweet, probably not.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.920
My sweet, soft boy, I cannot wait to marry you,

31:15.920 --> 31:17.600
or I'm so glad to be married to you

31:17.600 --> 31:19.280
if this airs after October 22nd.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.320
It didn't.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.280
We crushed it.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.280
Hannah, cheers.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.560
Cheers to our years together so far

31:26.560 --> 31:27.920
and the bright future ahead.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.960
All my love, Hannah.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.960
And that's from Hannah for Daniel.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.320
So I'm glad that you all,

31:34.320 --> 31:36.880
hope you all had a happy ceremony.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.160
I'm glad you found each other.

31:38.160 --> 31:38.720
Hold tight.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.800
A lot of lucky Daniels out there.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.680
Lucky Daniels.

31:43.680 --> 31:44.160
Today.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.280
We got a lot of love.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.720
Or maybe one Daniel.

31:46.720 --> 31:50.160
Or maybe one lucky, but complicated.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.600
Not faithful, Daniel.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.240
Yeah, so let's not maybe suggest that, Travis.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.800
One fortunate, yet problematic Daniel.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.680
Or two just regular Daniels.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.800
I think it's a two regular Daniels situation.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.960
And also there's lots of lucky Daniels out there.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.920
Daniel Stern is having sort of a renaissance,

32:07.920 --> 32:10.000
a career revival, which I'm very excited about.

32:10.000 --> 32:10.240
He was in-

32:10.240 --> 32:10.960
Is he back?

32:10.960 --> 32:13.760
Yeah, man, he was in Christmas Story 2 about 10 years ago.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.760
I actually have a third Gembatron here,

32:17.760 --> 32:20.480
and it's from Travis to Teresa.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.320
Yeah, and it says, happy fourth wedding anniversary.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.680
I love you very much.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.360
Love your husband, Travis.

32:27.360 --> 32:27.840
Now did you-

32:27.840 --> 32:28.800
No, I do want to say,

32:28.800 --> 32:30.320
because I think this was just like a cute thing

32:30.320 --> 32:32.240
that you just did, but I do need that $100.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.320
I actually, I did pay for it

32:34.320 --> 32:37.520
because I don't want to take food out of my own mouth, ever.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.080
I love putting food in my mouth.

32:40.080 --> 32:40.960
Why would I take it out?

32:40.960 --> 32:42.000
How's it going, everyone?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.040
I'm Oliver Wang.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.080
And I'm Morgan Rhodes.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.480
We have a brand new show on the Maximum Fun Network

32:46.480 --> 32:47.920
that we'd love to share with you.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.040
It's called Heat Rocks.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.680
Morgan, we should probably explain what a heat rock is.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.720
It is a banger, a fire track, true fire.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.760
Right, dope album.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.560
Each episode, we will bring on a special guest to join us

32:58.560 --> 33:00.080
to talk about one of their heat rocks.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.200
It might be a musician.

33:01.200 --> 33:01.920
A writer.

33:01.920 --> 33:02.720
Maybe a scholar.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.640
I mean, I would have been happy to just talk to you

33:04.640 --> 33:07.040
about your heat rocks, but this is a different show.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.720
Yeah, I think people might enjoy hearing

33:08.720 --> 33:10.000
maybe the guests instead.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.240
To do that, you'll have to go to MaximumFun.org.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.840
So if you want to talk about hot music,

33:13.840 --> 33:14.720
you should check us out.

33:14.720 --> 33:15.360
Heat Rocks.

33:15.360 --> 33:19.360
Yes, I bet if that cat ever tries to stand still in Memphis,

33:19.360 --> 33:20.560
it's fucking miserable for him.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.360
Oh, it's awful.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.800
Cannot get into a line.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.640
Cannot wait for a bus.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.360
Or I mean, it's probably equally bad if he is walking in Memphis

33:27.360 --> 33:29.120
because just everyone down the street like,

33:29.120 --> 33:29.920
I got him.

33:29.920 --> 33:30.320
I see you.

33:30.320 --> 33:30.960
There he goes.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.160
Got you, motherfucker.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.800
Like the song, douchebag.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.640
This is, of course, from one of our Elseworlds

33:38.640 --> 33:40.080
alternative universe fictions

33:40.080 --> 33:42.960
where anybody knows what Mark Cohn looks like, but still.

33:42.960 --> 33:45.120
He probably can't even go to Memphis, huh?

33:45.840 --> 33:47.520
It's probably just over for him.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.880
It's probably done.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.760
No way he can't.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.640
No, no way.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.320
I got a Yahoo here.

33:52.320 --> 33:52.960
It was sent in.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.080
Oh, I don't know who sent it in.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.120
Hold on.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.400
I hate this fucking website so much.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.800
It was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.200
God, he's fucking owning this shit right now.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.000
Thank you, Seth.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.720
It's another Yahoo Answers user who didn't choose username,

34:06.720 --> 34:07.840
so we'll call him Mark Cohn.

34:07.840 --> 34:13.360
Asks, how does one end a griffin's occupation of a castle?

34:14.080 --> 34:14.800
Wait, what?

34:14.800 --> 34:18.560
And then there's a picture of the lion bird griffin.

34:19.280 --> 34:19.840
Not you.

34:20.640 --> 34:22.800
Well, I mean, I think I could occupy a castle-

34:22.800 --> 34:25.280
Griffin, did you pick this for yourself?

34:25.280 --> 34:27.760
I think I could occupy a castle pretty good

34:27.760 --> 34:31.120
to the extent where you two couldn't get up in my castle

34:31.120 --> 34:34.720
because I have all kinds of traps and gates and walls

34:34.720 --> 34:40.000
and armaments and pots of hot fluid

34:40.000 --> 34:42.240
and catapults and trebuchets.

34:42.240 --> 34:45.200
You ever think about moats and how gross they must have been?

34:45.200 --> 34:46.640
Because that's just like fucking stagnant water.

34:46.640 --> 34:49.040
It's stink water, probably Mosquito City,

34:49.040 --> 34:51.280
which is another sort of defense mechanism.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.240
We got deet in here.

34:52.240 --> 34:53.440
You don't got deet out there.

34:54.240 --> 34:55.760
But wouldn't you be lonely, Griffin?

34:56.400 --> 34:57.520
I don't care about that.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.080
I got the safest castle in the whole land.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.920
Wouldn't you be lonely?

35:01.920 --> 35:04.800
Loneliness would eventually siege my castle, yes.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:06.400 --> 35:09.520
And then I think you'd welcome some other people in

35:10.240 --> 35:11.600
and that's when we get you.

35:12.320 --> 35:12.960
Oh, no.

35:13.840 --> 35:16.000
You shouldn't have dropped your guard, motherfucker.

35:16.000 --> 35:16.800
Why'd you let us in?

35:16.800 --> 35:18.000
Why'd you open the portcullis?

35:19.280 --> 35:20.640
Um, all right, let's do-

35:20.640 --> 35:22.080
Friendship is a weakness!

35:22.080 --> 35:23.440
We can do a different one.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.720
All right, let's do a different one.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.920
This one is an emb-

35:25.920 --> 35:26.480
Oh, fuck.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.480
Fuck.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.920
I never thought it would end like this.

35:31.920 --> 35:36.240
I want a Munch Squad!

35:36.240 --> 35:42.080
I want two Munch Squad!

35:42.080 --> 35:43.120
Welcome to Munch Squad.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.640
It's a podcast within a podcast.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.160
McDonald's.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.120
Good start, good start, good start.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.480
I know it's gonna be good if my boy Ronald's in the mix.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.880
This headline's gonna take you on a journey.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.480
And things are gonna seem normal

35:56.480 --> 35:57.840
and then things are gonna pivot.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.520
McDonald's introduces buttermilk crispy tenders.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.040
Art posters.

36:03.040 --> 36:03.540
Guys.

36:05.120 --> 36:05.680
Whoa.

36:05.680 --> 36:11.440
McDonald's introduces buttermilk crispy tenders comma art poster.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.800
Okay, the comma is so important there because,

36:14.800 --> 36:16.160
I mean, it's still Buckwild,

36:16.160 --> 36:18.960
but I thought it was come get these posters of the tenders.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.160
It's still Buckwild.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.160
So these tenders are seasoned and battered

36:22.160 --> 36:23.440
and breaded to perfection.

36:23.440 --> 36:28.400
Perfection and they pair perfectly with nine McDonald's sauces.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.040
And here's the quote from McDonald's chef,

36:33.760 --> 36:36.000
Michael Harkas.

36:39.040 --> 36:42.080
Our new buttermilk crispy tenders are another example

36:42.080 --> 36:44.000
of how we're giving customers the food they love.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.280
We also know they have a lot of passion for our sauces.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.240
So we created a brand new signature sauce

36:50.240 --> 36:52.400
that perfectly compliments buttermilk crispy tenders

36:52.400 --> 36:54.640
with the ideal balance of sweet and tangy flavors.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.200
It might be my new favorite.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.960
Please don't tell Honey Mustard,

36:58.960 --> 37:00.000
which is of course the name of his wife.

37:00.000 --> 37:00.960
You said that?

37:00.960 --> 37:02.240
Oh, I was gonna say.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.160
Or, I mean, on the inverse,

37:05.120 --> 37:07.200
this dude fucks a big bucket of honey mustard.

37:07.200 --> 37:07.920
That's possible.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.880
Okay, so Chef Mike is far from alone

37:12.880 --> 37:14.880
in his dipping sauce devotion.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.320
Is this, wait, wait, oh God.

37:16.320 --> 37:16.880
So many questions.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.360
Is this like the Joanie Ive of McDonald's?

37:19.360 --> 37:20.720
Is there just, today.

37:20.720 --> 37:25.280
Hey, I'm proud to, this dipping sauce is tangy

37:25.280 --> 37:27.200
and it has a nearly invisible bezel.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.720
By the way, they don't describe this new sauce.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.760
So it's a fucking cliffhanger in the press release.

37:33.760 --> 37:34.000
Great.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.520
You just gotta go and see for yourself.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.880
It's the latest addition to an already legendary

37:38.880 --> 37:40.960
McDonald's sauce lineup that's so beloved

37:40.960 --> 37:43.840
you might even say fans are obsessed.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.640
You might say that.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.240
You shouldn't.

37:48.240 --> 37:49.280
You shouldn't.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.240
You didn't.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.200
So here we are.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.800
McDonald's is celebrating the launch

37:52.800 --> 37:54.240
of Buttermilk Crispy Tenders

37:54.240 --> 37:57.280
by letting sauce fans show their appreciation

37:57.280 --> 38:00.320
as they would for any other pop culture phenomenon

38:00.320 --> 38:02.880
with limited edition, custom screen printed,

38:03.440 --> 38:04.800
gig style posters.

38:06.800 --> 38:07.120
Oh God.

38:07.120 --> 38:13.760
So the thing, is this because Rick and Morty

38:13.760 --> 38:16.560
made everybody horny about Szechuan sauce for a little bit?

38:16.560 --> 38:17.200
I guess.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.360
They're like, they think people care all of a sudden,

38:19.360 --> 38:21.680
except they don't have, unless it's that one.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.480
They're trying to tease that, I think,

38:25.040 --> 38:28.000
as like the hot new thing that they're doing.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.360
I would also say that like, when was the last time?

38:31.360 --> 38:34.880
I mean, maybe, but like, if I go to a fast food place

38:34.880 --> 38:38.400
and they offer like ranch and honey mustard and ketchup,

38:38.400 --> 38:40.320
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.640
I've seen those before, but this is suggesting

38:42.640 --> 38:45.280
they're offering ranch, honey mustard, ketchup

38:45.280 --> 38:50.080
and a gig style art prints, custom hand printed poster.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.000
This is a quote from Billy Bauman,

38:54.560 --> 38:56.720
co-owner of the Delicious Design League,

38:56.720 --> 38:58.800
a graphic design studio and print shop.

38:59.440 --> 39:02.080
Limited edition, illustrated screen printed posters

39:02.080 --> 39:03.920
have really taken off in recent years,

39:03.920 --> 39:08.000
expanding from music to TV, movies, games,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.880
and now apparently fucking McDonald's sauce.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.120
So I guess those are over with now.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.480
They're a collectible way for fans

39:14.480 --> 39:16.160
to express their unique fandom.

39:16.160 --> 39:19.600
Are you fucking, what universe is this?

39:19.600 --> 39:22.080
No one cares as much about McDonald's sauce.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.080
When creating these posters, we approach them

39:24.080 --> 39:26.240
as we would any intellectual property.

39:26.240 --> 39:32.160
Shut up, trying to capture the feeling

39:32.160 --> 39:34.640
and defining characteristics of each sauce

39:34.640 --> 39:36.960
in one eye popping visual.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.200
Just wet and salty, how do you get that?

39:39.200 --> 39:40.960
It's just wet and salty.

39:40.960 --> 39:45.600
Hey, so I hear you saying you want one and I hear you.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.160
Customers will have the chance to receive

39:48.160 --> 39:51.040
their favorite limited edition sauce poster

39:51.040 --> 39:53.520
at participating McDonald's restaurants

39:53.520 --> 39:55.600
on Saturday, October 7th.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.920
So here's the thing, here's the thing.

39:59.040 --> 40:03.040
There's probably never been a more important participating

40:03.040 --> 40:05.280
in the history of English language

40:05.280 --> 40:08.000
because if you walk into the wrong McDonald's

40:08.000 --> 40:11.600
and you say, hi, I would like a poster of Buttermilk Ranch

40:11.600 --> 40:14.560
please, you will be escorted out.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.800
You will not be welcome at that McDonald's anymore.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.520
It's just, can I play this off

40:21.520 --> 40:22.960
where you come into my house

40:23.840 --> 40:28.080
and you see the hot mustard poster

40:28.080 --> 40:29.360
and somebody says, what's that?

40:29.360 --> 40:33.440
And I say, oh man, ACL Fest last year,

40:33.440 --> 40:34.960
you had to see hot mustard.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.360
I skipped Wilco to go see hot mustard

40:37.360 --> 40:40.800
because they're so good music players.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.480
Justin, you haven't talked about this.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.920
Nine of these fucking things.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.840
Gotta catch them all, gotta catch them all.

40:47.840 --> 40:48.560
Whoa.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.240
Yeah, I just linked you guys.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.960
You can go to buttermilkcrispytenders.com

40:53.680 --> 40:55.440
and check out all these posters.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.520
They do have a very tasteful McDonald's logo

40:57.520 --> 40:58.640
in the bottom left-hand corner

40:59.600 --> 41:02.240
just in case there's any dispute

41:02.240 --> 41:07.280
about where you got your Buttermilk Honey Mustard poster from.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.120
I'm currently checking for my closest

41:11.920 --> 41:14.240
participating McDonald's

41:14.240 --> 41:16.000
where I'm going to just wander in.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.360
None in Huntington.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.440
Great, I guess I don't get one.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.640
I'm sure the PO box will be filling up with these

41:23.280 --> 41:26.800
because now that I see them, it's literally all I want.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.720
The only thing I want in my entire life.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.520
You know what?

41:29.520 --> 41:31.840
I dig the shit out of these posters.

41:31.840 --> 41:32.880
Damn it, Travis.

41:32.880 --> 41:37.120
They're so cool and they have sauce names on them.

41:37.120 --> 41:37.920
I waited-

41:37.920 --> 41:39.120
Sauce names on them.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.200
Spicy Buffalo looks great.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.840
I waited in line to get an SNES Classic this morning.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.440
I would happily trade it away

41:45.440 --> 41:46.960
for one of these beautiful posters.

41:46.960 --> 41:51.040
Also, sub-question, is it bad form or good form

41:51.040 --> 41:52.720
after you secure one of these posters

41:52.720 --> 41:54.640
at a participating McDonald's?

41:54.640 --> 41:57.760
And by the way, you know this is a fucking Austin thing.

41:57.760 --> 42:00.400
Definitely live music capital of the world.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.560
You know that they are all over this spot.

42:04.560 --> 42:07.280
Is it possible to get everybody who works at the McDonald's

42:07.280 --> 42:08.000
to sign it?

42:09.120 --> 42:10.560
Oh, that's a good call.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.000
That's going to be worth something someday.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.760
I've been watching Antiques Roadshow.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.040
I know how this shit works.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.960
Can you imagine putting one of these posters on your wall

42:18.960 --> 42:22.320
and then just shrooming so hard and staring at it

42:22.320 --> 42:24.240
until you can taste the poster?

42:24.800 --> 42:26.400
Is taste a factor?

42:26.400 --> 42:27.920
Did they put that in the ink somehow?

42:29.280 --> 42:30.400
If we're talking about some Snosberry

42:30.400 --> 42:32.080
tastes like Snosberry situation,

42:32.080 --> 42:33.600
yeah, I think I would actually get into these.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.440
A hot mustard poster that tastes like hot mustard,

42:35.440 --> 42:36.000
I think so.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.480
So they have vinyl stickers too.

42:38.480 --> 42:42.000
And I do want those on my laptop post-taste.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.880
They're so good.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.240
I've gone full 180 on this.

42:46.240 --> 42:47.680
I think this is a great promotion.

42:47.680 --> 42:48.320
I'm so excited about it.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.080
There's one that's just for honey.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.280
It makes me so happy.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.000
It's just honey.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.720
The sauce is just honey.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.400
And I really like the poster.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.480
This is so good.

42:58.480 --> 43:02.320
I still, though, even if I knew for a legal fact

43:02.320 --> 43:04.640
that it was a participating McDonald's,

43:04.640 --> 43:08.000
I still cannot imagine going to the counter

43:08.000 --> 43:08.960
and being like,

43:08.960 --> 43:12.240
can I have a poster about your tangy barbecue sauce, please?

43:13.360 --> 43:14.640
Is that available?

43:14.640 --> 43:15.520
Apparently, they're free

43:15.520 --> 43:17.440
with the purchase of Buttermilk Crispy Tenders.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.880
I mean, I hope that falls on a cheat day

43:18.880 --> 43:21.280
so I can just go for it.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.440
This morning, I was walking out to my car

43:23.440 --> 43:25.920
so I can go to work, and in my lawn,

43:25.920 --> 43:28.320
there was an entire bowl of Froot Loops just sitting there.

43:28.960 --> 43:32.160
It had a bowl, milk, Loops, middle spoon, and all.

43:32.160 --> 43:34.080
It wasn't from anyone in our family,

43:34.080 --> 43:35.520
and I don't have any friends

43:35.520 --> 43:37.920
that would, for some reason, do this nearby.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.440
I'm so confused.

43:39.440 --> 43:40.720
How did it get there?

43:40.720 --> 43:42.480
Was someone walking down the sidewalk

43:42.480 --> 43:44.000
eating an entire bowl of cereal?

43:45.280 --> 43:46.800
Why on the ground, in my yard,

43:46.800 --> 43:47.920
of all places to leave it?

43:48.880 --> 43:50.320
Do I clean the bowl and spoon

43:50.320 --> 43:51.760
and leave them in my yard for the perpetrator

43:51.760 --> 43:52.960
to pick it back up?

43:52.960 --> 43:54.000
I'm so confused.

43:54.000 --> 43:54.880
Please help.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.960
That's from Lily in New York.

43:56.960 --> 43:57.460
Man.

43:58.320 --> 43:58.640
Wow.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.720
So many possibilities here.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.360
First one, viral marketing for...

44:05.920 --> 44:07.040
I don't know, man.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.880
Maybe they got lime once again.

44:08.880 --> 44:09.600
They got lime.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.360
I mean, you're suggesting it's Froot Loops.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.520
It could be for, you know,

44:15.840 --> 44:18.000
Hacksaw Ridge now on Blu-ray

44:18.000 --> 44:20.080
because the guy ate Froot Loops in that one.

44:20.080 --> 44:22.160
I haven't seen it, but that's just an example.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.520
It. Maybe it's a it thing.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.640
The kids love Froot Loops

44:24.640 --> 44:26.320
before they're hurt by the clown.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.840
Another possibility.

44:27.840 --> 44:28.640
Another option,

44:28.640 --> 44:30.320
and this is probably the more likely one,

44:30.320 --> 44:32.320
is it's a Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs

44:32.320 --> 44:34.560
or Kazam-style food miracle.

44:34.560 --> 44:35.440
Fell down from the sky

44:35.440 --> 44:36.640
and it was very limited scope

44:36.640 --> 44:37.120
or perhaps the...

44:37.120 --> 44:38.800
Very specific, Griffin.

44:38.800 --> 44:39.600
Very specific.

44:39.600 --> 44:43.200
Or I mean, perhaps the food miracle struck downtown

44:43.200 --> 44:44.800
and there was a crosswind

44:44.800 --> 44:46.880
and this one bowl of Froot Loops

44:46.880 --> 44:49.040
did make it all the way down the street.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.160
And now that I've said that,

44:50.160 --> 44:52.800
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what we're dealing with here.

44:52.800 --> 44:53.920
It's sort of just a...

44:53.920 --> 44:57.040
Just it got picked up in a westerly

44:57.600 --> 44:58.800
and ended up in your lawn.

44:59.600 --> 45:00.880
I would like to pause it.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.000
I would like to pause at one other possibility, Griffin.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.760
Better than a child made a shack wish

45:05.760 --> 45:07.280
and then a stiff wind caught it?

45:07.280 --> 45:08.400
Absolutely not.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.760
But another possibility.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.800
And then we'll get back to shack wish.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.960
Momentum pinned.

45:14.960 --> 45:15.460
Yeah.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.040
Do you ever set your keys down

45:19.040 --> 45:20.640
and then you did it without thinking

45:21.280 --> 45:23.120
and then you can't remember where you put your keys?

45:24.400 --> 45:27.680
Maybe Question Asker did this themselves.

45:31.280 --> 45:36.000
You mementoed a bowl of looped cereal into your yard

45:36.880 --> 45:38.320
and didn't think about it.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.280
You were eating cereal.

45:39.280 --> 45:43.600
You said, oh, I left my work papers inside

45:43.600 --> 45:45.840
and you thoughtlessly sat your cereal down

45:45.840 --> 45:47.280
in the middle of your lawn,

45:47.280 --> 45:48.960
went back inside, grabbed the papers,

45:48.960 --> 45:50.080
came back out and you're like,

45:50.080 --> 45:51.440
who put this cereal here?

45:51.440 --> 45:52.320
But it was you.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.280
Yeah, it was you.

45:53.280 --> 45:53.760
You did it.

45:53.760 --> 45:54.720
Who put the cereal there?

45:57.120 --> 45:59.600
You be tempted at all to eat this bad boy or what?

45:59.600 --> 46:00.080
This is a no.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.520
Probably not.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.360
This is probably a hard pass for me.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.640
If it touches the lawn, it's probably a no

46:06.640 --> 46:07.680
because I've got ants.

46:08.320 --> 46:11.600
Oh, the biggest clue that you didn't include.

46:11.600 --> 46:15.760
Was the cereal still in a crunchy form?

46:15.760 --> 46:16.080
Right.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.440
Or had it been sitting there long enough

46:17.440 --> 46:18.960
to absorb all of the liquid?

46:20.560 --> 46:24.320
One time I dropped Henry off at daycare in the morning.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.760
I came inside and I saw a plastic lid

46:27.760 --> 46:30.720
of a fountain drink cup sitting in my driveway

46:31.600 --> 46:34.880
and I thought, I'll get you on the flip, my dude.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.000
You're gonna stay right there

46:36.000 --> 46:37.840
and when I go to get Henry this afternoon,

46:37.840 --> 46:38.800
I'm gonna get you.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.880
And when I came back, the lid wasn't there

46:40.880 --> 46:43.760
and it was in fact on top of an anthill in my yard,

46:43.760 --> 46:46.160
probably about 15 feet away.

46:46.880 --> 46:49.200
And some ants, some ambitious ants came,

46:49.200 --> 46:51.120
put a little moon roof on their situation.

46:51.120 --> 46:54.240
And I respect the hustle is what I did.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.080
And I think that this might have been like

46:56.800 --> 47:01.600
the biggest fucking haul ever for these big powerful

47:01.600 --> 47:02.720
and hungry ants.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.240
Can you imagine being an ant that's like,

47:04.240 --> 47:07.360
oh, dunk, somebody left a full bowl of Froot Loops

47:07.360 --> 47:08.560
up on their front porch.

47:08.560 --> 47:12.480
Let's get that shit and then get it back to the hive queen

47:12.480 --> 47:13.440
or however ants work.

47:13.440 --> 47:14.720
Nobody's quite sure.

47:14.720 --> 47:18.080
And have a bowl of Froot Loops as an ant colony?

47:18.080 --> 47:19.760
That's awesome.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.200
Ah, I love thinking about that.

47:22.560 --> 47:24.640
There's no way that that's not what happened.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.000
It's definitely ants.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.040
It's definitely ants.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.720
100% ants.

47:28.720 --> 47:29.440
Or?

47:29.440 --> 47:30.400
I'm sorry, ants.

47:32.160 --> 47:32.720
Unless.

47:33.520 --> 47:34.400
Unless.

47:34.400 --> 47:40.560
Unless you live next to maybe a lazy or cash strapped

47:40.560 --> 47:48.560
big game hunter that really wants to kill a toucan.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.320
And that's an easy con.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.360
And it's kind of against the spirit of the hunt.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.400
And you just hear like a folly from outside.

47:56.400 --> 47:57.920
You hear like, folly it is.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.440
It's like, oh, shit, get him.

47:59.440 --> 48:00.240
Go, go, go, go, go.

48:00.240 --> 48:01.120
Now quick.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.320
The trap is sprung.

48:02.320 --> 48:03.200
Got you, Daniel.

48:04.960 --> 48:07.280
Look around at other yards in the neighborhood.

48:07.280 --> 48:09.600
And if you see like a bowl of Frosted Flakes.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.640
Yeah.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.640
And like, I don't know, maybe some Honeycrisp.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.720
I think there was a bear associated with that one.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.840
And Griffin, in this fantasy scenario,

48:20.160 --> 48:22.320
the reason that it's in the neighbor's yard

48:22.320 --> 48:25.040
is that they didn't want to kill an endangered bird

48:25.040 --> 48:26.080
on their own land.

48:26.080 --> 48:26.960
Is that the idea?

48:27.520 --> 48:27.920
Yes.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.920
To maybe cook up a cockamamie story

48:29.920 --> 48:32.880
that they were like defending their neighborhood or something?

48:32.880 --> 48:35.760
The toucan is a vicious beast.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.440
It'll use that big powerful beak.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.720
Take your neck right off.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.400
Bite your whole neck off.

48:40.400 --> 48:41.040
And so you-

48:41.040 --> 48:42.800
And then you'll be left without a neck.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.320
Now you're gonna live without your neck.

48:44.320 --> 48:46.720
Yeah, it's real hard.

48:46.720 --> 48:49.280
And so you do it in your own yard.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.040
And it's obviously entrapment.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.160
You do it in a neighbor's yard.

48:52.160 --> 48:53.440
It's a good Samaritan.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.520
Yeah, I was protecting him from a toucan Daniel.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.600
But really, you just wanted that toucan Daniel

48:57.600 --> 48:58.720
to hang up on your wall.

48:58.720 --> 48:59.760
And I will say one thing.

48:59.760 --> 49:00.560
That's one-

49:00.560 --> 49:02.400
You know his name is Toucan Sam, right?

49:03.920 --> 49:04.960
Is it Toucan Sam?

49:04.960 --> 49:07.280
It's not Toucan Dan?

49:07.280 --> 49:10.080
Toucan Dan was the dumb monster factory thing me and Justin made.

49:11.040 --> 49:11.840
Damn, dude.

49:11.840 --> 49:14.560
My own IP has become so fucking rich.

49:15.360 --> 49:17.760
I can't even keep track of it.

49:17.760 --> 49:18.260
Damn.

49:19.040 --> 49:19.840
Damn, Daniel.

49:19.840 --> 49:20.800
Damn, Daniel.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.160
Do you guys remember damn Daniel?

49:23.840 --> 49:26.080
We leave out seeds for birds.

49:26.080 --> 49:29.360
We leave out big blocks of salt for deer.

49:29.920 --> 49:33.520
Why aren't we leaving anything out for stoned colleges?

49:33.520 --> 49:37.280
Leaving out for stoned college kids who are just wandering around.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.280
I think it's nice that you want some like-

49:40.720 --> 49:45.040
Honey, I love being out here on the terrace.

49:45.040 --> 49:51.360
Wouldn't it be nice though if we could watch some fucking college kids just wander around

49:51.360 --> 49:54.160
and listen to Rusted Root and eat Froot Loops out here?

49:55.040 --> 49:57.520
I want to put out some Froot Loops and see if we can't get some.

49:57.520 --> 49:59.680
Because I think that would really complete the Vista.

49:59.680 --> 50:03.280
Wouldn't it be great if we could look out the window and see a gaggle of shaggies

50:03.280 --> 50:06.080
just eating all the Froot Loops we've left?

50:07.120 --> 50:12.080
Yeah, a murder of shaggies swing by and just like nest in the tree

50:12.080 --> 50:14.160
where we've hung a bunch of Froot Roll-Ups.

50:14.880 --> 50:15.360
Look at them.

50:16.000 --> 50:16.880
They're beautiful.

50:16.880 --> 50:19.200
Why haven't you migrated, little fella?

50:19.200 --> 50:19.700
Aww.

50:21.120 --> 50:26.320
We built this special stand so that the squirrels can't climb up and get the Hot Pockets we've left.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.560
He's so cute.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.360
He stinks like shit, but I love him.

50:31.360 --> 50:38.240
Do you think cartoon shaggy ever tried to get people to call him Mr. Boom-Bastic?

50:41.360 --> 50:43.440
Shaggy, who unmasked this ogre?

50:43.440 --> 50:44.240
Was it me?

50:44.240 --> 50:45.440
It wasn't me.

50:45.440 --> 50:51.280
Was there ever an episode where that cartoon man smoked a bunch of weed?

50:52.000 --> 50:55.600
Because it was always implied but never seen.

50:55.600 --> 51:00.080
But there was probably situations where he just, you know, ripped one right off.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.360
The better question, I get what you're saying, Griffin.

51:03.360 --> 51:09.760
I think the obvious connotation is that anytime he is not directly in frame,

51:10.480 --> 51:12.560
shaggy is smoking weed.

51:12.560 --> 51:16.160
I mean, that's like anytime you're not directly looking at him, he's smoking weed.

51:16.160 --> 51:24.720
The question for me becomes, do you think shaggy has taught Scooby-Doo to smoke weed?

51:24.720 --> 51:26.720
Because that would be my bigger question.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.480
It's like, they're so close.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.840
They're such friends.

51:29.840 --> 51:34.480
Shaggy would want him to share in his kind conch.

51:35.040 --> 51:40.720
Maybe he gets Scooby-Doo to smoke weed with him is my question.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.320
That sounds like animal cruelty.

51:42.320 --> 51:44.480
Yeah, it's not responsible.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.240
It's irresponsible.

51:46.240 --> 51:49.200
It should be noted also that Scooby-Doo has glaucoma.

51:49.920 --> 51:51.680
Oh, okay.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.240
Folks, that's going to do it for us this week.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.760
We hope you have enjoyed yourself.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.120
Sorry for being away again for so long.

51:59.120 --> 52:01.200
We had a few things we wanted to talk about.

52:01.760 --> 52:06.800
Yeah, so the first one, and this is a little more serious than we normally deal with on the show,

52:06.800 --> 52:12.480
but America recently has been hit by a lot of natural disasters,

52:12.480 --> 52:18.080
and especially Puerto Rico has been hit and hasn't really been receiving the help

52:18.080 --> 52:26.720
that maybe some of its more mainland American counterparts, thank you, have been receiving.

52:26.720 --> 52:31.200
So our friend and amazing person, Lin Manuel Miranda,

52:31.200 --> 52:36.640
has been helping to lead the charge on getting some aid and getting some help for Puerto Rico.

52:36.640 --> 52:40.480
So if you would like to help out and make a donation,

52:40.480 --> 52:44.400
you can go to hispanicfederation.org slash donate.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.400
And I would also suggest checking out Lin's feed on Twitter

52:48.400 --> 52:52.240
to see all the stuff that they're working on to try to get some help for Puerto Rico.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.160
And just do what you can.

52:54.160 --> 52:58.160
And just in general, anytime you see people needing some help,

52:58.160 --> 52:59.680
do what you can and help them out.

53:00.240 --> 53:04.400
Also wanted to let everyone know that at New York Comic Con this year,

53:04.400 --> 53:08.560
we are going to be doing a panel about the Adventure Zone graphic novel.

53:08.560 --> 53:12.400
It's gonna be me and dad and Carrie Peach,

53:12.400 --> 53:14.880
who is the artist working on the graphic novel,

53:14.880 --> 53:17.200
and it's gonna be moderated by Patrick Rothfuss.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
So that's gonna be, I think, a whole lot of fun.

53:20.000 --> 53:30.480
And it's Friday morning at 10.30 at the Hudson Mercantile, 10.30 on Friday morning.

53:30.480 --> 53:31.760
So come out, check it out.

53:31.760 --> 53:35.200
And then we're going to be doing a ticketed signing afterwards.

53:35.200 --> 53:38.480
So the first 75 people who show up to the panel

53:38.480 --> 53:41.360
are gonna get tickets to the signing afterwards.

53:41.360 --> 53:44.480
So come hang out with us and say hi.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.040
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

53:47.040 --> 53:50.160
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

53:50.160 --> 53:53.040
It's a very, very good album, and it's like one of my fall favorites.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.600
So if you haven't listened to it or any of the Long Winters music,

53:56.320 --> 53:59.440
all the albums are very, very good, and they're gonna get you in that autumnal mood.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.520
Also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

54:01.520 --> 54:04.160
You can go to MaximumFun.org, check out all the great podcasts there.

54:04.160 --> 54:09.120
Shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself, One Bad Mother, Lady 2 Lady,

54:10.160 --> 54:11.840
The Greatest Generation,

54:11.840 --> 54:19.040
which is also doing a new show about the new series called The Greatest Discovery.

54:19.040 --> 54:22.080
We have two Star Trek podcasts on our network.

54:22.080 --> 54:23.440
Fucking step off.

54:24.480 --> 54:26.160
All great shows all at MaximumFun.org.

54:26.160 --> 54:28.960
And if you wanna see the other shows and videos and stuff that we do,

54:28.960 --> 54:30.880
you can go to McElroyShows.com.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.560
I wanna mention real quick that Rachel and I have a new show called Wonderful,

54:34.560 --> 54:37.440
which has replaced our Bachelor recap show Rose Buddies,

54:38.160 --> 54:39.680
that I've really enjoyed doing.

54:39.680 --> 54:43.040
We're only four episodes in, and it's just a podcast where we talk about stuff that we like

54:43.040 --> 54:44.880
and try to stay positive about everything.

54:45.840 --> 54:50.240
So go check out Wonderful if you want.

54:51.280 --> 54:55.360
Along those same lines, I wanna let everyone know that my friend Tybee and I

54:55.360 --> 54:57.280
have started a new podcast called Run,

54:57.280 --> 55:02.160
a Doctor Who fan cast to replace Interrobang, the show we used to do.

55:03.040 --> 55:08.720
It's kind of a rewatch Doctor Who discussion news kind of thing.

55:08.720 --> 55:13.520
So far, we've watched the first three of the Eccleston series,

55:13.520 --> 55:16.400
as well as the eighth Doctor Paul McGann movie.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.600
So if you wanna check that out, you can find it on iTunes

55:19.600 --> 55:22.960
or just by searching Run, a Doctor Who fan cast.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.840
Justin, you got anything you wanna plug?

55:25.840 --> 55:26.960
I'm on my grind.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.280
Just every day, you know it's your boy.

55:29.280 --> 55:33.120
I'm on my grind 24, 24 eight, that's me.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.520
So here's a final Yahoo is sent in by like five different people.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.600
It was sent in by a lot of folks.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.800
Thank you, it's from another.

55:40.800 --> 55:42.560
Oh, wait, sorry, one more thing.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.760
We do have something to plug.

55:44.720 --> 55:50.000
The Adventure Zone is gonna be starting the new arc coming next week.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:51.040 --> 55:53.440
Well, starting this week, we're gonna be doing our world building episode.

55:53.440 --> 55:54.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:54.080 --> 56:00.560
So if you wanna get on board, get on the ground floor of a new adventure,

56:00.560 --> 56:02.160
then come join us on Thursday.

56:02.160 --> 56:05.520
Yeah, Thursday, October 5th, we're gonna have our world building episode.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.840
We're gonna be doing a few like mini arcs.

56:07.840 --> 56:11.360
So like little two, three episode arcs where we're all gonna be taking turns

56:12.160 --> 56:15.440
telling new stories and playing new games and exploring new genres.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.520
Dad has a superhero story planned out.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.440
We're gonna be playing the fate system.

56:19.440 --> 56:20.480
I'm very excited about it.

56:20.480 --> 56:24.960
We've got our characters ready and I'm super psyched for y'all to hear it.

56:24.960 --> 56:28.640
So yeah, this Thursday, we're gonna be doing like a preliminary world building episode

56:28.640 --> 56:30.480
so you can find out what we're gonna be doing

56:30.480 --> 56:32.880
and who we're gonna be playing and it's gonna be really fun.

56:32.880 --> 56:36.000
Also wanna mention that we're gonna be adding another My Brother, My Brother and Me show

56:36.000 --> 56:39.360
in Chicago when we're doing our Midwest tour this November.

56:39.360 --> 56:41.440
We're gonna be there one day early at the Chicago Theater.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.640
That's November the 16th at the Chicago Theater

56:44.640 --> 56:48.560
and tickets for that are gonna go on presale this Wednesday the 4th

56:49.360 --> 56:51.280
starting at 10 a.m. central time.

56:52.160 --> 56:56.560
I think we'll probably be sharing the link whenever the site is available

56:56.560 --> 56:58.960
but you can find out details on the Chicago Theater's website.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.400
But in order to get tickets in the presale,

57:00.400 --> 57:05.440
you're gonna have to use a special password and that special unhackable password is...

57:07.120 --> 57:09.040
See that bike just drove by trying to get the password.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.280
The password is My Brother, all one word.

57:11.280 --> 57:17.360
That's gonna get you the presale Wednesday, October the 4th at 10 a.m. central time

57:18.320 --> 57:22.880
and then they're gonna be on sale for the public this Friday the 6th at noon central time

57:22.880 --> 57:24.800
but go ahead and get on there.

57:24.800 --> 57:30.320
Get the presale tickets going and keep an eye out for the link and come see us November 16th

57:30.320 --> 57:34.400
in Chicago and we're gonna be doing My Brother, My Brother and Me so come see us.

57:34.400 --> 57:35.280
All right, Griffin.

57:35.280 --> 57:36.160
Yeah, final Yahoo.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.520
This one was sent in by a bunch of folks.

57:37.520 --> 57:39.280
Thank you everybody who sent this one in.

57:39.280 --> 57:42.960
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to name Michael.

57:43.680 --> 57:48.080
Asks, who named the moon the moon?

57:50.800 --> 57:52.480
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:52.480 --> 57:53.600
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:54.720 --> 57:55.920
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

57:55.920 --> 58:01.200
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

Every week on Inside Pop we take turns recommending something great

58:24.160 --> 58:26.320
from the world of pop culture to each other.

58:26.320 --> 58:31.120
And in the month of October we're going big, very big with the Big Cell 30.

58:31.120 --> 58:35.360
Every day for 30 days we're going to suggest some type of pop culture to check out.

58:35.360 --> 58:39.200
Things that may not be on your radar but will be well worth trying.

58:39.200 --> 58:45.760
From TV to music to movies and more, the Big Cell 30 is as irresistible as a Jedi mind trick.

58:45.760 --> 58:49.040
As convincing as an Annalise Keating closing argument.

58:49.040 --> 58:53.920
And as seductive as Miguel singing a ballad shirtless and slightly sweaty.

58:53.920 --> 58:57.440
