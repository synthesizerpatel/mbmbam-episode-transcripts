00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.160 --> 00:50.160
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060

You're not gonna do that every time now I tried that I did not feel

01:31.980 --> 01:34.380

02:22.380 --> 02:27.020
Yeah, and so I I already had this and

02:27.940 --> 02:32.620

02:32.620 --> 02:35.340
I'm very well connected. I'm sending it to you right now. Oh

02:35.340 --> 02:42.220
Oh cool. I'm emailing it to you right now. Is it a cameo from the from the president?

02:42.420 --> 02:50.220
No, no, no. No, do you know Joe Biden's up there Joe Biden's in there? It's like $75. It's he's not busy with

02:50.860 --> 02:56.160
What a steal? He's got a lot of stuff going on right now that you get a part. Could you get a part in that way?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.160
Oh, I like you trick him

02:58.620 --> 03:01.420
Or or some kind of appointment that way like

03:01.420 --> 03:03.420
Oh

03:04.180 --> 03:09.360
Travis what have you done? We just got this email bud. Yeah. Well, do you want to tell everybody?

03:11.820 --> 03:18.420
I'm it's it seems to me that Travis has purchased us some some land

03:19.780 --> 03:25.780
Why some land travel I said one square foot each. Yeah, your Lord's now. Oh

03:26.740 --> 03:29.580
Really? Yeah. Yeah, I was already one. Oh

03:29.580 --> 03:30.900
Oh

03:30.900 --> 03:36.020
Congratulations, and then I saw that this this place was offering a buy one get one free sale

03:38.740 --> 03:42.540
This is this is how everyone does it I'm pretty sure this is how everyone does it

03:42.540 --> 03:47.060
And so I went ahead and took advantage of that great deal now

03:47.060 --> 03:52.340
I will say they were offering three different levels one square foot five square feet and ten square feet

03:52.580 --> 03:57.820
Well, I didn't know what you guys would do with five square feet that you wouldn't do with one square, right?

03:57.820 --> 04:02.300
Yeah, that's a good make you five times the lower like does it up? Are you a duke at that point?

04:02.300 --> 04:06.180
I have I they didn't seem to compound in any way

04:06.180 --> 04:13.220
It seemed to just be like you could like have room for a picnic. Oh, yeah, get married, right? You can get married

04:15.220 --> 04:17.220
You lop off

04:19.900 --> 04:27.220
This is this is a classic pub challenge you lie diagonally in the box right and then you fit you got a light

04:27.220 --> 04:32.980
I ain't wait a minute. This is a sucker's bet burn me bury me in the one bow. There you go

04:35.380 --> 04:40.460
Chop me up. It's square feet right so you can dig of like what I'm five ten

04:43.100 --> 04:48.260
We'll give them a few inches in case there's some like topsoil loss degradation

04:48.260 --> 04:53.220
Oh, that's it six foot two and the top of my head will be four inches under the surface

04:53.220 --> 04:55.220
If you just stand me right up in there

04:55.220 --> 04:58.300
Maybe we could say like can you arrange it?

04:58.300 --> 05:02.080
So are each of our one square plots of land are next to each other now

05:02.080 --> 05:06.580
We got three in a row right so three feet long one foot wide

05:06.860 --> 05:12.200
Right stack us up guys. This is how has nobody thought of this yet?

05:12.780 --> 05:18.580
Cemetery space is at like a premium now and it's because they're laying our dead asses horizontal

05:18.580 --> 05:24.300
That's dumb. That is such a waste of space straight up and down baby straight up and down stack

05:24.300 --> 05:31.500
Me like like Ikea furniture. This is insane. You know what I mean. Yeah, global global warming and everything stack me up

05:32.100 --> 05:37.700
Go boy, you know what as far as I'm concerned use me as a fuel source. I don't care dead

05:38.420 --> 05:41.200
All right, get to real Travis. Thank you for this gift

05:41.420 --> 05:46.100
Yeah, it does feel a bit like the International Star Registry thing now

05:46.100 --> 05:52.460
This is legit Griffin because I paid money for it and they ran as you can see in the form

05:52.460 --> 05:57.980
It was witnessed by someone. Yeah, and it is really my it is written in sort of a fancy

05:58.700 --> 06:00.700
Kurt like pseudo cursive

06:01.060 --> 06:03.060
Foul digital cursive. Yeah

06:04.300 --> 06:10.460
Hey, but do I have too much power now because I I do have a star named after me. Thanks noni big up

06:10.460 --> 06:12.380
You're the Star Lord now. Oh

06:12.380 --> 06:14.060
shit, yeah

06:14.060 --> 06:18.540
That's dope. Yeah, that's very cool. I get to kick it with like so what do I do?

06:18.540 --> 06:23.500
Oh, yeah, good question. I have to go it might gonna have to solve a cozy murder

06:24.020 --> 06:28.540
Here's what I'll say Justin if anyone ever accidentally wanders through your one square foot

06:29.300 --> 06:36.140
Then you then are responsible for their well-being, but they're also responsible for like your happiness now

06:36.140 --> 06:39.460
Here's what I'll say. This is the trick that nobody tells you but I know this hack

06:39.460 --> 06:42.660
They don't know I know this hack once you buy the plot of land, right?

06:42.660 --> 06:46.900
That's one square foot around but it goes all the way into space baby, right?

06:46.900 --> 06:50.740
Oh, that's all the way up. It never stops above it, right?

06:50.740 --> 06:54.980
So a plane going through it spaceship going through it a comet going through it

06:54.980 --> 07:00.820
It's all yours for for the second. It's in there. Yeah, that's so you're welcome guys

07:01.300 --> 07:06.760
Hey, Rachel edit this next part out, but or beep it Travis. How much money did you spend on these?

07:07.500 --> 07:09.120
bucks

07:09.120 --> 07:14.180
Okay, and it was buy one get one free. Like I said, it's a good deal. That's very good deal

07:14.180 --> 07:19.140
Okay, the number you ever said was not a tremendous amount of money. Not at all that beeped out

07:20.140 --> 07:25.380
Okay. Now here's my question. This is something I I debated over in my own heart

07:25.540 --> 07:31.980
Does it seem more like a scam if it had cost more or more legit if it costs more? Wow

07:32.860 --> 07:36.100
Because at the amount I paid there's partners like that can't be enough

07:37.620 --> 07:42.720
There's a typo there's there's there's six zeros missing from this from this number

07:42.720 --> 07:46.760
Well, I feel fancier already. Yeah, I think fight, baby

07:47.480 --> 07:54.240
That just has have you all done other than purchasing lordships for us? How is y'all's fanciness journey gone?

07:55.640 --> 07:58.440
What have I done an increase in either?

08:00.120 --> 08:02.120
Quality of life

08:02.320 --> 08:04.000
status or

08:04.000 --> 08:10.180
Whimsy, I was already pretty fancy to begin with. Yeah. Sure, man

08:10.180 --> 08:15.820
I wore a robe after I got out of the shower yesterday. Oh hell. Yeah, can I say something?

08:15.820 --> 08:19.100
I fucking get robes now. Oh, yeah

08:19.100 --> 08:24.740
Yeah, now sometimes you don't have the juice to get from naked to clothed, you know

08:24.740 --> 08:28.540
Yeah, you need a little robe is a nice way of saying like I'm building to it

08:28.540 --> 08:34.980
Just calm down a little bit there. There's not enough transitional clothes. I would say like robe is basically it

08:34.980 --> 08:38.980
There's not a lot of like well, I I don't want to wear the clothes

08:38.980 --> 08:42.260
I've been wearing all day anymore, but I know if I put in pajamas, I'm going to sleep

08:43.180 --> 08:48.700
And then it's robe. Like this is the thing is there's very few. I think robe is the only

08:49.540 --> 08:54.220
Transitional like piece of clothing I can think of when Harry wakes up in the middle of the night

08:54.420 --> 08:57.480
Because he got scared from one of his incredible mind visions

08:58.260 --> 09:02.460
I'm you know, I looked at by the way take him to professor X or something, dude

09:02.700 --> 09:08.020
Yeah, and they're what's weird is that they always come true. Yeah. Anyway, I don't have time

09:08.020 --> 09:11.140
They always contain spider-man. Yeah, he's always in there

09:11.140 --> 09:17.200
And anyway, I don't have time to like get fully dressed while my son is screaming about how?

09:17.740 --> 09:20.760
Fucking huggy-wuggy tried to eat our whole family

09:21.420 --> 09:24.780
And so just the robe is like I'm like a fucking firefighter

09:24.820 --> 09:30.060
Like I just throw the robe on and I'm like up there like don't worry son. Huggy-wuggy is not real

09:30.240 --> 09:35.620
Yeah, I throw on my robe and my long winter cap and then I go and I'm like, hey, what's up?

09:35.620 --> 09:41.140
Can I say something? Can I say something to YouTube real quick? Hey YouTube. What's up? Love your stuff

09:41.140 --> 09:46.100
Hello, great fun. Hi YouTube. I love your stuff for kids pancake contests and

09:47.700 --> 09:49.700
recreating Spongebob

09:49.860 --> 09:52.700
Clips, it's funny and I love it

09:52.700 --> 09:59.060
If you can stop putting horrible monsters in every third video that are scary to me a grown-up

09:59.460 --> 10:04.260
That would be fucking radical. Thank you so much. Thank you so much

10:04.260 --> 10:09.080
No more huggy-wuggy. No more siren head get those shits out of my household

10:09.080 --> 10:16.280
I do not need them. You maybe should be policing your your kids. I am watching it, but there's just I'm not kidding

10:16.280 --> 10:18.580
It's like hey, what's up? It's the pancake boys

10:20.000 --> 10:26.040
Today we're gonna have silly fun with slime. I'm like, yes. Yes. Yes, and the next one like this big clown will kill you

10:26.640 --> 10:28.640
Don't let the big clown kill you

10:28.640 --> 10:35.160
You're aware that this is happening Griffin. Why don't you turn it off the big clown that will kill you because um, you know

10:35.160 --> 10:37.160
If I'm you know, you're invested

10:37.320 --> 10:42.440
yeah, well, I'm watching sports on a TV that I got a lot of money on and I don't always have the sort of like I

10:43.200 --> 10:49.520
Can't split my attention right? Oh, yeah. No, no, no Bengals are out there make a pop of those stacks of bread

10:50.440 --> 10:52.440
Anyway, I'm a good dad

10:52.440 --> 10:57.800
Yeah, all right, I'm not here to argue that that seems true now

10:59.280 --> 11:02.560
Your children are lordlings. Oh, that's true

11:04.080 --> 11:09.240
I'm so excited to get started and this is an advice show you wish you've certainly guessed by now. Certainly a right

11:09.240 --> 11:11.720
Yes, present a question to your lord

11:12.960 --> 11:18.480
Oh, maybe I could be the middle is Lord Travis McElroy. Maybe that I don't think that that's a great vibe

11:18.480 --> 11:24.620
Honestly, I'm your lord and savior Travis McElroy. What's wrong? That's better. Yeah Christmas this year. My roommate bought me a new tea kettle

11:25.360 --> 11:31.880
Pink and very cute. By already have a tea kettle. Oh, no, and I love my tea kettle. It's powder blue

11:31.880 --> 11:34.680
I've had it for years. I don't want to stop using it

11:34.960 --> 11:39.640
However, my roommate and I obviously live in the same house and she will notice if I don't use the new tea kettle

11:39.680 --> 11:44.260
We are not close. Oh my god. What it's what? Oh, sorry finish the

11:44.260 --> 11:47.940
Name, how do I handle this tea kettle for two? That is a

11:49.180 --> 11:54.420
Brutal way to end this message. It's a real leg sweep. Isn't it? We are not close. We are well, it does it

11:54.980 --> 11:58.700
Colors it don't oh, it's a hugely important piece of information for sure

11:58.700 --> 12:02.140
It's the kind of context that like I wish our year theme had been about

12:02.660 --> 12:09.260
Context because I feel like that is it is that is my big push for this year is please give us the essential tools

12:09.260 --> 12:14.900
We need to advise you right and what I love about this context, too, is it's not just like a like, you know

12:14.900 --> 12:17.580
It's a two-bedroom house. It's not a physical piece of context

12:17.580 --> 12:22.300
It's not it is much more emotional context of this person saying just FYI

12:22.340 --> 12:25.060
This problem isn't really that bad for me

12:25.060 --> 12:30.300
Like I I want you to know that I've thought about this but at the end of the day and we're not close

12:30.500 --> 12:36.340
It's fine. I I still have in my house a like yellow stoneware tea kettle that I

12:36.340 --> 12:41.140
I think brought with me all the way from like Cincinnati, which was I've been looking for that

12:41.700 --> 12:43.620
12 yeah

12:43.620 --> 12:46.420
Over a decade ago and I used to use it a lot

12:46.420 --> 12:49.740
I used to I got into tea for a little bit. I would have some oatmeal

12:49.740 --> 12:52.620
I would neti pot all these things require a good tea kettle

12:53.460 --> 12:55.460
You and neti pot with the same

12:55.940 --> 12:57.580
tea kettle

12:57.580 --> 13:02.300
You had a neti pot, right? You had a neti pot, right? You weren't using the tea kettle, right?

13:02.860 --> 13:04.860
No, Travis

13:04.860 --> 13:12.540
Travis this show people spend the minutes they have in their life and their day on this show

13:12.540 --> 13:14.980
And I feel like in 2022

13:15.500 --> 13:21.700
We don't need to stop and take up that time to say things like did you put the tea kettle in your in your nose?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.700
I was obviously

13:24.340 --> 13:30.840
We're all adults now the holes too big. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Well, I don't know maybe no no stretches

13:30.840 --> 13:37.960
Anyway, I don't fuck with it anymore because it got pretty like weirdly burnt and gnarly and calcified on the inside

13:37.960 --> 13:43.080
Oh, so maybe you should start using the new tea kettle because here's the thing

13:43.080 --> 13:46.160
I know you like yours and you've had it for years

13:47.000 --> 13:52.160
But it's a tea kettle. It does a thing where it makes the water hot and it goes

13:53.280 --> 13:55.280
It doesn't beep. I can't whistle

13:55.280 --> 14:02.200
Um, and I bet you this new one does that shit too. Pretty good. Yeah, but it's not emotionally invested

14:02.200 --> 14:07.440
Great, like when you're talking about cozy shit like a teapot. That's like saying like that blanket

14:07.440 --> 14:10.040
I've had the same I've had a blanket with yeah

14:10.040 --> 14:14.640
It's red white and black and green with Scotty dogs on it that I got when I was like 10 years

14:14.640 --> 14:19.160
Oh shit, you still you still fuck with that blanket. I still got that shit

14:19.160 --> 14:23.360
I have taken excellent care of it

14:23.360 --> 14:28.440
It is still comfy cozy and it is as wonderful as the day I got it, right?

14:28.440 --> 14:34.680
Does Teresa know you like slept with that in like middle school in the bad years?

14:36.560 --> 14:42.920
Let's call them the dark ages. Yes. Yes. Yes in in the pubes. Yes, of course, of course. I

14:42.920 --> 14:50.440
I wish that Scotty blanket were granted the ability to speak for one day

14:57.920 --> 14:59.920
What the hell out

14:59.920 --> 15:11.160
Oh you motherfuckers the things I want a little

15:15.320 --> 15:20.640
No, you do not oh you stay away from that monster I'm gonna look for an open furnace

15:22.160 --> 15:27.200
Leave me outside so that the birds may tear me a pieces and I may be free

15:27.200 --> 15:33.680
Okay. Anyway Travis. Do you need to get the fuck rid of that blanket? My friend is still great, but I've taken wonderful care of it

15:35.640 --> 15:41.200
But I would also argue there was a period of your life where you took whatever the opposite of carries you took hurt to it

15:41.200 --> 15:46.120
You took hurt of it. Anyways, my point being there's an emotional investment in things

15:46.240 --> 15:49.160
You don't want to have a tea kettle from someone that let's face it

15:49.160 --> 15:54.040
You're not close with and then like four years someone says that's a great tea kettle

15:54.040 --> 15:58.080
Where'd you get it? And you're like, uh, it was from my roommate. Their name was uh, oh, what was it?

15:58.080 --> 16:03.080
That's not it is if this though is a situation where you don't have beef with your roommate

16:03.080 --> 16:07.680
It's just you guys have never really clicked. I would say that's fertile ground for a friendship to blossom, right?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.640
I'm not gonna project that onto you if you're not interested in it

16:10.640 --> 16:16.960
That's that's one thing but if it's just like a weird situation where it's like, yeah, we never like hung out and got to be friends

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
I think this is a foot in the door

16:18.960 --> 16:23.880
Where you say like this is a Bartlett Charlie moment where you're like, ah, thanks for this new teapot

16:23.880 --> 16:27.140
You know, I've been saving this teapot for the right roommate

16:27.140 --> 16:33.800
I think that's you and now you're gonna pass on your emotional powder blue teapot. No new best friend

16:35.600 --> 16:41.320
And you say like and yeah, you see that stamp on the bottom that's right. This was made by Paul Revere

16:41.320 --> 16:48.000
This was Spiro Agnew's teapot. It's been in my family for 300 years

16:49.800 --> 16:53.280
Don't run the math on that don't think it's a gift

16:54.120 --> 16:59.440
Yeah, I think I think go for it. I think it's a new it's new hot shit and it's not gonna be you

16:59.440 --> 17:01.440
What if it boils water better?

17:01.440 --> 17:09.680
What if the whistle is more pleasant listen if you've never had like a sick-ass tea kettle that you love

17:10.120 --> 17:14.800
Like I don't I don't know if you right now listener brothers are imagining

17:15.320 --> 17:17.960
Your special hot boy. Oh, yeah

17:19.160 --> 17:23.400
Yeah, like I wouldn't I wouldn't I couldn't be apart from my kettle anymore

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
It's got a little knob that lets me set the temperature

17:25.960 --> 17:31.000
Come on. What I got a water boiler. What what you're thinking of like a water heater

17:31.000 --> 17:34.360
You're thinking of like the the thing that heats the water Justin

17:34.360 --> 17:40.740
I have that that makes the hot water and then I have an adorable little lime green round boy

17:40.920 --> 17:44.760
That then I like pour the water into to make the tea. Okay

17:45.480 --> 17:49.880
Just get tea kettle go paleo on it. Do it like the ancestors did it

17:51.040 --> 17:57.840
But then I need that for like all the other hot stuff. This is a fancy teapot fancy take flight, right?

17:57.840 --> 18:03.560
so I got my hot water maker and then I've got like this is for like a tea party because I have

18:03.960 --> 18:07.480
Fancy doesn't mean unbridled consumer is it's not

18:08.120 --> 18:14.280
Justin my wife and I like to have afternoon tea and I want to have the teapot sitting there and a whole set with it

18:14.480 --> 18:19.960
Okay, I'm I feel like can I say hey Griff? Can we talk first? Yeah. Yeah. I'll go over here

18:20.080 --> 18:27.360
I'm a little worried that the selection of our year theme is going to become something of a an albatross around our necks

18:27.360 --> 18:33.240
It's specifically in regards to the middle brother. Yeah use it as a sort of like like I

18:33.960 --> 18:39.200
Feel like we've given Travis permission to make terrible choices in fiction. Yeah

18:40.240 --> 18:43.720
Yeah with his actual money and his actual life

18:44.120 --> 18:47.880
But in like it's all part of the bit

18:49.000 --> 18:52.560
What were you guys talking about? I got distracted. I was ordering pinky rings in bulk

18:52.560 --> 18:59.480
What we're trying to figure out with the new mission of possibles coming out because a lot I thought it was I thought it was March

19:00.760 --> 19:03.600
And I thought it was Travis stop buying things

19:05.760 --> 19:07.280
March can I

19:07.280 --> 19:11.340
Do okay talk talk. Can I call the wizard he got pissed he got guys

19:11.340 --> 19:15.680
I got a fucking angry email from him for not calling him last week. I was like, dude, it's our

19:15.680 --> 19:22.000
Annual year naming one like we don't do content. It's like an easy one for us to kind of chill out on

19:22.320 --> 19:26.560
Yeah, so I got somebody over here. That was actually lined up to

19:28.640 --> 19:35.560
Be on last week's show and he was really disappointed that that he couldn't get off what I what a bone-chilling bit of

19:36.920 --> 19:42.680
At this point one of two people and both of them I believe kill just like in like that

19:42.680 --> 19:47.200
Wouldn't you if you have me fucking pinned down like that? No, I'm pretty you'd love that

19:47.200 --> 19:52.000
Wouldn't you if you thought you had this beautiful mine palace all mapped out with a little brochure?

19:52.000 --> 19:56.920
You can hand out to the the tourists that come by like here's the different rooms that are here. I know them all

19:56.920 --> 20:02.280
Hey Justin, am I wrong? That's one of one of two people. How do you know you're talking to Justin right now? Oh my god

20:02.280 --> 20:04.160
I look on about it

20:04.160 --> 20:08.920
Anyway, I made the wizard angry. He shot a thunderbolt in my wiener and I was like, okay fine

20:08.920 --> 20:15.080
I'll get you on the next one. So this one's a kind of loved it. No, man. It was hotter than the Sun

20:15.800 --> 20:18.560
Randy sent this one in. Thanks Randy Randy

20:19.400 --> 20:25.800
All right, and it's it's just give a shout out sure how to sneak your cat into work

20:26.120 --> 20:27.080
Thank you

20:27.080 --> 20:32.040
If you're how if your kitty and booth is giving you the sour face every time you leave for work every day consider bringing him

20:32.040 --> 20:36.760
To work your boss doesn't have to know with a few sneaky tools the right cat temperament and a little ingenuity

20:36.760 --> 20:39.840
Your kitty can be sitting in the middle though, huh?

20:42.440 --> 20:45.800
Successfully smuggling your cat into the office does require a good deal of preparation and strategy though

20:45.800 --> 20:51.800
In addition, you'll have to plan your activities at the office very carefully. I like that. It's like cat temper. I'm like, okay, mr

20:51.800 --> 20:58.960
Boots, I know that normally you're kind of a piece of shit. Yeah, we're at the office. I need you on your best behavior

20:58.960 --> 21:01.800
Okay, do you understand me? Do you understand me little man?

21:01.800 --> 21:07.560
I know you you cannot understand things like the economy, but that yummy wet stink food that you eat

21:07.560 --> 21:14.720
I acquire with the resources from work that I do for work. I trade my labor for

21:16.400 --> 21:21.440
Just you know, what are you saying for your piss and that you piss in?

21:22.040 --> 21:24.040
anyway, number one

21:24.520 --> 21:26.040
Consider the options

21:26.040 --> 21:28.040
Okay, I feel like no

21:28.040 --> 21:33.520
Person should be able to get past this step where it's like one of my options take my cat to work or don't take my

21:33.520 --> 21:37.720
Cat to work. Wow, that second one sounds way better way way better

21:37.880 --> 21:43.360
That seems like that should be like the first line in every wiki. It should say like keep your grades up

21:44.360 --> 21:50.360
Yeah, keep your grades up. Maybe don't do this. Maybe don't like hey, what what's the best step in planning a heist?

21:50.560 --> 21:52.560
Maybe don't oh that would be

21:54.040 --> 21:57.520
Assess your cat's personality to decide if he's the sort of cat that could be happy and quiet at work

21:57.520 --> 22:00.560
If you have really not he's giving you a stink face while you leave

22:00.840 --> 22:01.320
Yeah

22:01.320 --> 22:05.220
That maybe the cat just doesn't like you and wants to spend less time with you

22:05.400 --> 22:09.840
If your cat's a proud and independent roamer who has activities you don't even have a clue about for most of the day or night

22:10.280 --> 22:11.760
Is a bad one

22:11.760 --> 22:15.640
Alternatively if your cat is quiet and often comfortable sitting near you for long periods of time

22:15.640 --> 22:18.080
He may be the ideal stealth cat for the office

22:19.040 --> 22:26.160
If your cat loves the sound of you clicking and making idle conversation with Susan from accounts payable

22:26.160 --> 22:28.280
This cat's ready to ride

22:29.280 --> 22:32.880
Cat loves the sound of like kind of a muffled radio

22:32.880 --> 22:39.220
But it's still a little bit too loud and everything kind of smells a little bit like farts. Oh, have we got the idea for you?

22:40.600 --> 22:42.600
Let's see here we got

22:42.720 --> 22:50.800
Hey Griffin, sit here quick. Any way here. Does it say to consider like what your business does before taking the cat in?

22:50.800 --> 22:54.840
No, that's a good point. If you are like a sandwich artist at Subway

22:54.840 --> 23:00.720
I'll argue this is maybe a bad way a bad career for you if you work on like a

23:01.080 --> 23:04.800
Big industrial production line with like huge gears and stuff

23:04.920 --> 23:11.400
That's probably also a bad time or like if you work for like a mouse breeding company or a cat food factory

23:11.400 --> 23:15.200
This is that bad. You don't want to do this consider the way you get to work

23:15.760 --> 23:20.960
Does he mind car or public transportation travel? Are you strong enough to carry him on your bike or by foot?

23:20.960 --> 23:24.800
Are you strong enough to carry your own cat? Are you strong enough to be his man?

23:25.520 --> 23:32.200
Are you strong enough to be your cat's man? Well, it's a 45 minute commute by car. I guess I could walk in there

23:33.680 --> 23:39.680
Margaret you're you're five and a half hours late. Yeah, I know what was that? Nothing. What stop?

23:40.920 --> 23:45.040
How about check the weather? Is it too hot too cold too wet or too windy to be carrying your cat around?

23:45.040 --> 23:50.280
I don't like this because now like if it rains does that mean you don't bring your precious or you don't bring home?

23:50.280 --> 23:53.720
Your fuzzy coat. Yeah, it started raining. Sorry. Hey, listen

23:54.400 --> 23:58.880
It's gonna be like a night at the museum situation. You do need to stay here

23:59.440 --> 24:05.100
If you could work on my TPS reports, no, that's ridiculous. Don't worry about it. Just don't die. Bye

24:06.960 --> 24:10.160
Choose a day that isn't heavenly mired in away from desk obligations

24:10.280 --> 24:14.600
It'd be cool to know a lot of factors at play here, huh? Yeah, okay

24:14.600 --> 24:17.360
So this is where we get to the fun stuff part to make preparations

24:17.360 --> 24:20.880
Be absolutely certain of where your boss and other other co-workers will be throughout the day

24:21.560 --> 24:25.880
Yeah, that's that's cool. They've drawn a very crude map here of the office

24:26.560 --> 24:32.400
With the boss's room, and of course the boss's room is like six times bigger than the other one. Cool. Cool. Cool

24:33.560 --> 24:37.320
Boss gets a dollar I get a dime. That's why I bring cats in on the company time

24:38.360 --> 24:41.120
So know where your boss is at all times with a map

24:41.120 --> 24:46.000
I guess you need to have a map for that information. You could get a GPS tracker on that bad boy

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Yeah

24:49.120 --> 24:53.400
Review any obstacles or hurdles you might face tracker. Yeah, make your boss out of the boss

24:54.200 --> 24:57.360
Make your boss and your cat both eat GPS trackers. So you can make

24:58.160 --> 25:01.120
They short out you could have a freaky Friday situation

25:03.400 --> 25:04.800
Okay

25:04.800 --> 25:09.040
Boss cat everybody stay with me here. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on though

25:09.040 --> 25:13.480
If you could convince everybody in the office to act like the cat is the boss

25:13.480 --> 25:19.280
Yeah, so when the boss comes in he's like at first he's like, all right guys, it's very funny

25:19.280 --> 25:24.720
And then as the day goes on he's like women. Oh, yeah. Oh this cat this cat came down from corporate

25:25.160 --> 25:31.160
They need to make some cuts. So best behavior. Mr. Jones. Don't be careful. Don't give him an excuse

25:31.240 --> 25:36.120
Give him an excuse. He said he's he said he's got his eye on you and he might just be playing with his food

25:36.120 --> 25:38.120
You know what? I mean? So like be careful

25:38.120 --> 25:45.160
Review any obstacles or hurdles you might face such as a meeting or your lunch plans. Hey dogs in the office

25:47.880 --> 25:52.040
Or it's big stinky fish day where everybody brings in the fish they caught

25:53.640 --> 25:58.400
So, okay now we get in to prepare the cat's necessities by or find a ventilated bag

25:58.640 --> 26:03.760
Preferably one that will conceal your animal and allow you to bring cat food treats quiet toys or a soft blanket and even a travel

26:03.760 --> 26:05.760
litter box

26:05.760 --> 26:10.920
You can you can ventilate any bag just take a bag and cut it up. You don't need to pay fans

26:10.920 --> 26:15.280
This is a life hack folks. Yeah, you can cut up any bag to make it cat appropriate

26:15.480 --> 26:19.000
Make sure the bag is not a designated cat or animal carrier. No, that would be

26:19.540 --> 26:21.640
Too good for the cat

26:22.160 --> 26:27.320
It actually if you want to help you could stencil on business bag and then all that's good

26:27.680 --> 26:31.400
Anybody hears like from it and they're like, what's that? And you're like, that's my business

26:31.400 --> 26:38.760
You what you do is you come in the day before and you're like my mom got me the worst fucking briefcase

26:40.040 --> 26:42.760
Wait till you guys see this thing. You're gonna be like goddess

26:43.560 --> 26:45.960
Terrific, it's useless and there's something in it

26:45.960 --> 26:49.720
I don't know if it needs oiled or what but it sounds like a cat that wants to get out of a bag

26:50.040 --> 26:56.240
Yeah, maybe write something in like French on it. And so like people like oh damn

26:56.240 --> 27:02.320
That's a fancy new European briefcase from the future. Definitely not the kind of briefcase. You'd put a cat in. Oh

27:03.320 --> 27:04.920
that's

27:04.920 --> 27:06.320
that's that's

27:06.320 --> 27:11.960
Villain and it's the new cat briefcase that has pictures of cats on it, but it is for files

27:11.960 --> 27:13.960
Do not do not trip on that

27:15.400 --> 27:18.960
Start bringing the bag into work at least one to two weeks prior to sneaking the animal into the office

27:18.960 --> 27:22.360
That's pretty good though. What is do you have a fucking cat in there? No

27:22.360 --> 27:26.600
I've got a little ocean here for me a human lunch. Nice try though

27:27.560 --> 27:29.560
Purchase a cat harness and a leash sure

27:30.040 --> 27:33.920
And then pack everything you need into the bag to determine if you can fit all items inside

27:33.920 --> 27:36.560
Well fuck I can get everything in here, but the cat

27:37.760 --> 27:41.520
I got I got a real chicken bag of grain and fox scenario

27:41.520 --> 27:45.480
That's actually hard because if you start with the cat that's bad, too

27:45.480 --> 27:50.720
Yeah, you're piling your fucking documents and blueprints on your cat

27:50.720 --> 27:55.600
That's uncomfortable, but then again if you get caught if you bring in a bag full of cat stuff

27:55.600 --> 28:00.840
But no cat and get caught then that's gonna raise some strange questions, right?

28:00.840 --> 28:05.600
We're just like hey, Doug. Why you got like a litter box and cat harness and shit in here

28:06.000 --> 28:07.480
What's that for?

28:07.480 --> 28:10.720
My cat you have a cat here. No, no, huh?

28:11.320 --> 28:16.680
In my head. I was thinking does it make sense for you to get in the bag and for your cat to bring you in?

28:16.680 --> 28:22.120
Mm-hmm, but I couldn't even figure out a justification for that

28:22.120 --> 28:27.840
You know even then someone could say look what the cat dragged in and everyone would laugh really hard. Yeah

28:29.400 --> 28:35.080
If the cat doesn't fit or seems cramped reconfigure how you packed your travel bag probably didn't need a wiki how tip for that

28:35.440 --> 28:40.280
You probably you probably could assume that I'm not gonna keep jamming stuff into this this

28:40.280 --> 28:47.320
The basket that you have tasked me with sneaking into the office until the cat begins to push through it like a Play-Doh mold

28:47.320 --> 28:53.260
I probably wouldn't figure out on my own that I should try and fucking fix it instead of hurting my cat with squishing

28:54.120 --> 28:57.140
For a smooth transition from home to office prepare your cat back a few days

28:57.760 --> 28:59.760
Before you plan to sneak your cat into work

28:59.940 --> 29:00.440
Okay

29:00.440 --> 29:06.000
In case there's a fire in your apartment building and you have to go straight to work from it have your go your go bag

29:06.000 --> 29:11.600
You should have a go bag ready to go. I mean just yeah for your cat. Okay, toady mckinney on the day

29:11.600 --> 29:15.120
It's time for the crime feed your cat. Can I just say I've been looking forward to this?

29:15.120 --> 29:20.920
This is like the moment and like oceans 11 where we've seen everything like all the prep and now here comes the big twist

29:20.920 --> 29:25.760
That we are never like the moment in the walk when Philip petite has organized

29:25.760 --> 29:31.700
You can't talk about this justice his crew for the coup and he's ready to walk ze line

29:31.700 --> 29:38.460
Okay from one of the beautiful towers and then we're supposed to root for this guy Justin. We are supposed to root for this person

29:38.460 --> 29:40.260
This is my great dream

29:40.260 --> 29:42.260
to walk across the void

29:42.780 --> 29:49.620
He's a bad guy in this movie and no one sees that we're watching his movie like he's the hero. No, he's not

29:50.100 --> 29:52.180
He's making a lot of people very nervous

29:53.220 --> 29:59.440
Listen, I love talking about Roberts Mex's fly at the line. Yeah as much as anybody

29:59.440 --> 30:03.600
It's weird that he had to do a CGI of his wife. No, it's the wire

30:03.800 --> 30:06.920
Yeah, the wire is a different thing woke up this morning

30:07.800 --> 30:16.400
Bought myself. That's the Sopranos. We're really off. Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah. All right feature cat breakfast. You should be doing that anyway

30:18.120 --> 30:20.120
No, we gotta keep you hungry for the

30:21.040 --> 30:27.000
Encourage the way you get sales encourage your cat to use the litter box. I would love to know how a person does that?

30:27.000 --> 30:32.600
Go go. Yeah, come on. Come on. Get that little hiney in that. That's thing. I found just to keep it fresh

30:32.760 --> 30:39.380
Yeah, that's true. That's your cats love spoiling stuff. Don't they? Oh, this is all new and clean. Oh, is it?

30:39.380 --> 30:45.320
Oh, let's see about that. It's business. Give your cat lots of affection and attention before you place in a bag. I love you. I

30:46.160 --> 30:48.160
Love you. Get it

30:49.440 --> 30:53.720
Instead of transferring the cat to the bag while you get ready for work make the transfer the last thing you do before you leave

30:53.720 --> 30:59.120
The house again. Yeah, don't do it before you go shower and brush your teeth and eat an egg

31:00.200 --> 31:05.560
To be fair. I thought it was going to say like instead of transferring the cat to the bag transfer the bag to the cat

31:05.800 --> 31:12.880
Yeah, just slam it right down on top of him and yell jam in the office with the kitty be confident. Oh, yeah. Yeah

31:13.560 --> 31:15.560
In general, I think that must be good

31:15.800 --> 31:21.460
After all, it's not really the first thing co-workers imagine different about Smith. He deserves a promotion

31:21.460 --> 31:24.360
He's confident like a man with a cat in the bag. Yeah

31:25.120 --> 31:30.040
After all, it's really it's not really the first thing co-workers imagine when another co-worker arrives at work

31:30.040 --> 31:32.040
Oh Alice must have a cat in her bag

31:32.360 --> 31:37.260
Yeah, I don't know if it smells like piss and you hear I would be like, hey Alice

31:37.600 --> 31:39.800
Is that a fucking cat in your bag?

31:40.240 --> 31:44.080
This is one thing for me to say but even wilder for you to do

31:44.080 --> 31:50.080
Is that a cat in your bag look around the office to see if anyone's around your office or desk?

31:50.080 --> 31:51.200
um

31:51.200 --> 31:53.200
But confidently, I guess

31:55.200 --> 32:00.420
Get away get away get away turn on your computer get set up for the day time for normal work for me

32:01.200 --> 32:04.760
Clickety-clackety-clickety-clackety clicky-clack-clack business reports

32:05.360 --> 32:09.280
And then decide whether having your cat let out of the bag is a sensible option

32:09.280 --> 32:17.960
Are you fucking kidding me after ice? That's gone after I spent $300 to create of what is a pretty chill zone a pretty

32:17.960 --> 32:23.560
Nice CZ for mr. Whiskers and I'm just gonna let him out into the general public

32:23.840 --> 32:29.620
That care was done one time. I flew with my cat when we were moving back to Cincinnati

32:29.620 --> 32:31.620
I flew with the cat and

32:31.800 --> 32:36.080
When we were going through security and I don't know if this is a standard procedure or what?

32:36.080 --> 32:42.080
we had to take the cat out of the bag and carry the cat through the scanner and put the bag through the thing and

32:42.160 --> 32:47.120
All I could think like if I let go of this cat for a second. She's gone forever

32:47.120 --> 32:52.400
Yeah, yeah, she'll board a flight to New York City. It'll be like a home alone to situation. Absolutely

32:53.720 --> 32:57.400
Then like is there's a bunch of tips that's like put some food and water out

32:57.400 --> 32:58.240
Yes

32:58.240 --> 33:02.040
Anticipate his needs by setting up the litter box after an hour of being out of the bag

33:02.440 --> 33:06.460
Margaret didn't I do didn't anticipate the need of it not wanting to be in the bag

33:06.460 --> 33:09.600
Like I need to not be in this bag. You didn't anticipate that need

33:09.600 --> 33:11.360
Why are you gonna think about the cat's knees now?

33:11.360 --> 33:15.680
You're only thinking about your own and I just say you guys we listen

33:15.680 --> 33:21.580
We have a lot of fun here and we talk a lot about wizard of the cloud and stuff this I'm uncertain

33:22.000 --> 33:24.720
What the end goal of that?

33:24.720 --> 33:30.760
Like what is the you brought your cat to work to fix what problem you think the cat's happier?

33:30.760 --> 33:34.600
Are you happier? It's like you said? Well, the cat doesn't seem to like that. I go to work

33:34.600 --> 33:41.480
How can I make both the cat's life and my workday a thousand times more stressful to convince the cat?

33:41.480 --> 33:43.480
It never wants to go to work with me again

33:43.480 --> 33:45.400
Um

33:45.400 --> 33:47.400
Let's talk about end of the day

33:47.800 --> 33:50.280
Target to go home kick back. Have a beer with your cat

33:52.040 --> 33:55.320
Go to happy hour with the cat but ask it to please be quiet

33:55.680 --> 34:01.520
Target to go home or not to drink because it's driving. Yep. This will allow you to escape crowds or peak hour traffic

34:02.520 --> 34:08.400
All things that could potentially cause kitty stress. Yeah. Hey boss. I'm taking off. It's 130. Yeah

34:08.400 --> 34:15.040
Yep, it's yeah, it's it gets crowded out there. You know, I came in at 430 though, so

34:15.560 --> 34:17.560
It's fine

34:17.800 --> 34:23.360
Place your cat's items back in the bag, of course shut down your computer, etc. A mission accomplished

34:24.040 --> 34:29.000
Like finish clean up your desk any crumbs on there? Why were you eating lunch your dress? Come on, man

34:29.000 --> 34:33.200
Take some time for yourself. Don't work through the lunch break and then it says mission accomplished

34:33.200 --> 34:35.860
You've successfully sneaked your cat into the work for a day

34:35.860 --> 34:43.140
but get ready like go ahead and start getting the bag ready for tomorrow because now this is it this is your life you love

34:43.140 --> 34:44.260
this now

34:44.260 --> 34:48.300
Some quick Q&A. Why would you bring a cat to work in the first place answer? Why not?

34:49.820 --> 34:52.700
Here's the problem once you get you got to set goals for

34:52.820 --> 34:55.220
Once you get used to the thrill of taking your cat to work

34:55.300 --> 34:58.700
You're gonna have to start chasing like bigger and better highs, right?

34:58.700 --> 35:02.980
You're gonna have to be to start bringing other things to work. Yeah, I brought my cat to work

35:02.980 --> 35:08.660
I'm gonna bring my car into work, right? Like what are you like? You're just gonna have to keep moving up until eventually

35:08.740 --> 35:10.740
Your house is at work

35:10.740 --> 35:17.340
Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I wanted to see your boss walk into your office and you're a little in your cubicle

35:17.340 --> 35:23.460
But you also have a Honda Civic in there. What no, this is a new computer. This is a new client boss

35:23.460 --> 35:26.500
You're embarrassing me this good. Well, I'm trying to close the Honda deal

35:28.340 --> 35:30.380
Is it better to leave the cat at home? Yes

35:30.380 --> 35:34.060
There's no logical reason to bring your cat to work if your cat gets lonely or bored

35:34.060 --> 35:36.060
You could pay a neighbor to come and pets it

35:36.260 --> 35:43.620
Okay. Well you just wasted my time. That's like saying like Danny Oceans gonna rob the casino. Well, he could just get a job

35:43.620 --> 35:46.860
It's way easier. No fucking duh. No, that's not the point

35:47.340 --> 35:50.380
Should I should I ask my boss if I'm allowed to bring a pet? Yes

35:50.380 --> 35:53.900
It's better to ask your boss so you don't get caught and risk losing your job. Hey boss

35:53.900 --> 35:58.960
Can I bring my cat to work? No, okay fucking idiot. All right. I already did

35:58.960 --> 36:06.500
I definitely will Sally did look around you. It's all cats it. Wait a minute. Wait accounting cats

36:06.820 --> 36:13.740
What HR cats? It's all cats. You're everywhere. It's everywhere. No, you can't bring your pet your cat to work. Okay

36:15.460 --> 36:17.460
What's that sound comes from your briefcase

36:18.420 --> 36:20.420
It's funny sound

36:20.420 --> 36:28.980
Machine of cat getting sick in bag. It's a joke briefcase. I got from Spencer give

36:29.220 --> 36:35.460
Did you call it Spencer gift? Yeah. Yeah, they only had one left. They have one is the only one they made

36:37.260 --> 36:42.620
Anyway, well, I feel like really I'm ready to take my cats at work. Yeah

36:42.620 --> 36:50.620
Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, let's take let's take cats to the to the money zone. All right, let's go

36:57.100 --> 37:02.220
Are we all waiting for the other ones to start it always kind of feels like that now with the money zone

37:02.220 --> 37:06.980
Is that we're just in like a reservoir dog standoff to see who's going to be the first one to start talking

37:06.980 --> 37:11.060
Well, the problem is is that there's only two ads and there's three of us. So it's always yeah

37:11.060 --> 37:14.020
Right. So somebody gets a sweet look. Yeah

37:14.660 --> 37:16.860
We don't work, but right

37:16.860 --> 37:20.700
Why don't we start things off then and I'll do a fake ad for a fake company that doesn't exist

37:20.700 --> 37:25.460
So the other two companies can't get mad at me because it's like not you know what I mean? Yeah. Yes

37:26.020 --> 37:28.980
Do you guys ever do you guys ever worry about?

37:30.700 --> 37:33.460
About hornets coming out of your house and

37:34.300 --> 37:37.020
Attacking you and your family while you sleep

37:37.020 --> 37:43.900
Well, I don't know I actively worry about that all the time. Well, I want to tell you about buzzer boys and

37:44.660 --> 37:46.980
This is a new sir an online service

37:46.980 --> 37:52.100
you can get the app on your phone and if you use our promo code you get one extra buzzer boy for free and

37:52.500 --> 37:54.500
these are

37:55.620 --> 37:56.740
Children

37:56.740 --> 38:03.300
From your neighborhood and it's good for them too because they can spend this money on beyblade and

38:03.300 --> 38:10.720
And what it is is the app lets you find children in your neighborhood to chase the hornets around inside your house

38:10.720 --> 38:12.720
until they get so tired that

38:13.440 --> 38:15.440
both the boys and the

38:15.680 --> 38:18.120
Hornets that they just kind of stop

38:18.120 --> 38:23.120
They just leave after a while or they sting the buzzer boys and then again

38:23.120 --> 38:27.760
It's not your problem anymore because that's the one day and don't worry. All our buzzer boys are

38:27.760 --> 38:33.320
Guaranteed not allergic to hornets. We have a very really

38:34.640 --> 38:40.320
My girl and you're like no no way. We're not gonna get caught like that again. So we do definite tests

38:41.000 --> 38:47.880
And they are accredited and they are gonna make you feel comfortable as they run around your house yelling while you are asleep

38:48.480 --> 38:51.800
Which is not if you can ask you a question. I don't want to step on your yeah

38:51.800 --> 38:56.520
Yeah, do you have a website yet for your for buzzer boys? They don't have like a phone number

38:56.520 --> 39:02.100
No, they don't have either of those because if you wanted to get that going I would don't do it

39:03.240 --> 39:09.960
Recommend Squarespace. Oh, wait, hold on wait buzzer boys gonna be fucking pissed off if you interrupt their ad to do another

39:12.680 --> 39:14.680
I know you were but you were gonna do that

39:15.120 --> 39:16.640
You know what now?

39:16.640 --> 39:22.400
Now fucking twist in the wind. Okay, so buzzer boys, they're cool. They're clean boys

39:22.440 --> 39:25.340
None of these chocolate, you know stained

39:25.340 --> 39:26.980
shirts

39:26.980 --> 39:28.980
No smudging's

39:29.020 --> 39:35.740
They smell great. And they're definitely fresh boys. These are fresh buzzer boys and they're don't help them

39:35.740 --> 39:40.980
They're not a scare. They don't get us scared of these of these flying menaces

39:41.740 --> 39:46.180
And they don't kill the bugs either. That's important to say they would never do that

39:46.180 --> 39:48.980
They just chase them out of the house really awkward

39:48.980 --> 39:54.020
But like I don't feel comfortable advertising for buzzer boys because I actually I use buzzer beaters

39:54.020 --> 39:59.600
Which they do they do kill the big deal out of like we kill the hornets from well

39:59.600 --> 40:02.920
It says here it says here unlike some other child based

40:04.000 --> 40:10.820
Hornet services we do not kill the hornets. We are this is a this is a very ethical operation

40:10.820 --> 40:14.660
So anyway, it seems like such a short-term solution. We're buzzer beaters

40:14.920 --> 40:17.080
So anyway, if you will beat the bugs

40:17.180 --> 40:20.140
So anyway, if you want to get on board with buzzer boys

40:20.140 --> 40:26.520
We have a special offer for you two buzzer boys for the price of one buzzer boy. All you have to do is go to

40:27.560 --> 40:33.120
Your local community center or rec center and look at the billboard there

40:33.120 --> 40:37.540
But the bulletin board and if it says something about buzzer boys on it, you're good to go

40:37.960 --> 40:42.240
It's only in a few cities now. So wait, there's these come when you need them

40:42.240 --> 40:47.400
You don't need to like call or anything. We are seeking ten and a half million dollars in startup funding

40:47.920 --> 40:49.360
Yeah

40:49.360 --> 40:52.260
If you know anyone who works on Shark Tank

40:53.200 --> 41:00.800
Go to your community center find us find us and God these fucking hornets are getting so big guys

41:01.600 --> 41:03.600
They're getting so big

41:06.600 --> 41:11.640
The end there's less of them but they're bigger there's less of them but they're huge

41:12.320 --> 41:17.520
For extra money we can get you a third buzzer boy that will collect the hornets wonderful, honey

41:17.520 --> 41:24.280
And you don't have that fresh you can have that fresh in your smoothie and it'll help you not be allergic to stuff anymore

41:27.480 --> 41:29.740
They do kill the hornets for that though

41:32.160 --> 41:35.140
They squeeze them over a over a big jar

41:36.420 --> 41:41.700
Now that's actually good to hear because the one problem I have with buzzer beaters is I feel like all that honey is going

41:41.700 --> 41:46.040
To waste it's going to waste it ends up all over the honey service, but my

41:46.040 --> 41:52.680
But the buzzer boy number three goes crazy on them and will just squish fistfuls of these guys over jars

41:52.760 --> 41:58.680
Until you wake up and you drink what comes out of them and get strong. What if I ask him to stop will he stop?

42:00.240 --> 42:04.120
Actually once you have signed a contract to get the third buzzer boy in there

42:05.760 --> 42:07.760
He cannot stop

42:08.600 --> 42:14.480
He'll tell you when he's ready to stop this is so important Griffin because this is an issue I have with buzzer beaters

42:14.480 --> 42:16.480
Oh, yeah, actually they'll leave, right

42:17.600 --> 42:19.600
Once they've had their fill. Yeah, sure

42:20.200 --> 42:23.200
Once they've had their fill of honey or had their fill of chasing hornets

42:23.200 --> 42:27.220
There's actually a special fee that you have to pay to make the boys leave

42:27.480 --> 42:31.680
And it is so much more money than what you pay to get them into your house

42:32.960 --> 42:39.040
Okay. All right. So can I just keep the boys there if I decide like what the hornets might come back?

42:39.040 --> 42:43.440
All right, so Squarespace is a great way to make a website

42:43.440 --> 42:47.300
Yeah, our shows sponsored in part by Squarespace who?

42:48.040 --> 42:53.560
Probably won't get as much ad time as buzzer boys, but still let's make it count

42:54.160 --> 42:56.800
And if you want to make your dream count, you need a website

You I'm John Moe my show depressed mode is all about mental health and this week

45:29.080 --> 45:34.080
I talked with Amanda Knox. She spent four years in an Italian prison for a murder

45:34.080 --> 45:38.920
She didn't commit that's a lot of trauma and she's okay talking about it

45:38.920 --> 45:44.880
If I touch on something that you'd rather not get into just say so we'll cut the whole exchange out

45:44.880 --> 45:49.380
But it also seems like you're pretty open open about a lot of things. Yeah. Yeah

45:49.380 --> 45:54.880
I am having trouble imagining anything that you could talk about that. I know what are we gonna throw a man tonight?

45:56.840 --> 46:00.060
Depressed mode with John Moe only on maximum fun

46:06.240 --> 46:12.080
For over a decade max fun con has been an incredible weekend of learning connecting and laughing with folks in the max fun community and

47:24.520 --> 47:27.880
Tickles the cerebellum and really really challenges

47:28.320 --> 47:32.760
Challenges think about fragrance think about your life and how you sting for most of it

47:32.760 --> 47:38.160
Think about how you have no fragrance and thus no memory. No one will remember you when you leave

47:38.160 --> 47:43.280
Hey Richard, you are probably the closest thing. I have to an expert that I can ask this question

47:43.880 --> 47:48.320
Okay in the movie in canto when Camilo changes into

47:49.080 --> 47:52.520
Does he smell not doing does he smell like the person? I

47:53.240 --> 48:00.180
Need everyone to listen to me. It's the first regular episode of winter. I can only come once a season

Why you know you smell great, but I just a joke I do this joke sometimes to keep people on their toes

49:10.220 --> 49:13.700
This is one of the jokes. I worked on. Okay, but one of my jokes

49:13.700 --> 49:16.180
I wrote the first one I have on my notepad here

49:16.180 --> 49:21.980
If you can see off I'll hold up my notepad to the microphone so you can see the first joke I have is your wife

49:21.980 --> 49:23.500
hate the way you smell

49:23.500 --> 49:29.940
Yeah, that's I guess it's kind of a lie though. If it's not true and Jesus doesn't like what are you doing here, Richard?

49:29.940 --> 49:33.000
That's a good question. I know what the fuck you're doing here. Richard's the same

49:33.140 --> 49:38.700
Are you doing anything different than you usually do here Richard? Yeah, very different man. Is it different smells?

49:39.660 --> 49:44.380
Difference. No. Yeah, I'm talking about new fragrances because it's winter. We got to get you ready

Unimpressible man. Listen, really, right?

50:14.700 --> 50:20.200
And you think I would love to smell like this person and now you can't with the power of celebrity fragrance

50:20.700 --> 50:26.960
Sure, what poets I wonder are all up in this industry right now. I never read the poem. I don't know

50:26.960 --> 50:30.860
I just mean Johnny Sun did a book right? I would smell like Johnny Sun

So now so now you can smell like all your favorite different people and I'm so excited to talk to you guys about

50:38.380 --> 50:39.700
I

50:39.700 --> 50:44.540
The thing is that I should mention. I don't know much about like America celebrity

50:44.540 --> 50:51.660
Okay, so I don't know like how cool or not cool these people are but I love the way they smell

50:51.660 --> 50:57.460
Yeah, I mean if they have a fragrance, they're probably pretty fucking cool Clive Barker. He's like a master of horror

50:57.460 --> 51:02.820
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah, he's got he's got Clive Barker's The Forbidden

51:03.500 --> 51:05.380
that does sound like a

51:05.380 --> 51:12.140
Scary movie Clive Barker might make though. It's a line right? There's three of them. So the first one we're gonna get you into is

51:12.780 --> 51:17.420
Foolish and vacuous perfume oil what that's what it's it's called

51:17.980 --> 51:23.100
Foolish and vacuous perfume oil. This is from black Phoenix

51:23.580 --> 51:29.300
Alchemy lab foolish and vacuous perfume oil. Here is the description, right? There's no notes

51:29.300 --> 51:36.900
It just says a scent with no depth a light Reedy almost vapid take on a classic

51:36.900 --> 51:44.700
Men's for jail. Oh, I actually I'll take that. Yeah, no, that sounds like he's saying this perfume sucks shit

51:44.820 --> 51:46.820
Yeah, it's not that

51:47.460 --> 51:53.180
It smells like water some chips smells like pine water the day burned white

51:53.180 --> 51:59.380
The day burned white this smells like plaster and spray paint modeled with buttermilk

51:59.980 --> 52:05.620
Wait, what the fuck is Clive Barker making perfume or is he having a vision?

52:06.620 --> 52:12.340
Plaster and spray paint modeled with buttermilk sweet chalky and edging on sickly

52:12.340 --> 52:14.340
Fuck off!

52:14.340 --> 52:18.340
White and golden amber beams of daylight pour through the belly of the scent

52:18.340 --> 52:24.580
We had we had some serious contract work being done on our

52:25.140 --> 52:29.060
Desiccated bathroom for most of last year very few times

52:29.060 --> 52:35.820
Did I walk into that room when it had been freshly drywalled or painted and said I'd love to smell like this all the time

52:35.820 --> 52:40.780
Well, you were missing the buttermilk Griffin. That's maybe the buttermilk sets it sets it right off

52:41.020 --> 52:46.060
Do you want to smell like Tim McGraw's love? No, wait, what was the third one from Clive Barker?

52:46.060 --> 52:49.020
It's a collaboration with Tim McGraw

52:49.820 --> 52:51.820
Sweet to the sweet

52:51.940 --> 52:58.460
Sugar upon sugar honey upon honey white cane sugar and honey. Absolute. That will bring in the hornets for sure. No

52:58.460 --> 53:00.460
Did he make Candyman?

53:01.300 --> 53:05.100
He is the Candyman. I think he did. This next one

53:05.100 --> 53:09.580
I don't know this celebrity, but I think you guys would be maybe you guys have come walk me through it

53:10.300 --> 53:12.300
His name is a grumpy cat. Oh

53:12.300 --> 53:15.580
Oh, yeah, this is a cat everyone

53:16.140 --> 53:23.380
Liked so much because he looked pretty pretty peoed most of the time. Unlike most cats. I do think he passed away

53:24.260 --> 53:27.100
But it's cool that he's still getting that cheddar

53:27.860 --> 53:29.860
Well, he's not

53:30.620 --> 53:35.980
His descendant so he's a grumpy cat is that the cat it says on the tin? Yeah

53:35.980 --> 53:40.420
Is he dead? I think I don't know. I'm thinking might have hit that rainbow bridge pretty hard

53:40.420 --> 53:45.700
So this is from the meter there cuz a lot of fragrances. I really like actually they've

53:46.420 --> 53:52.060
Petrichor, which is a smell after a rain. Yeah, come on. Yeah, but but grumpy cat

53:53.460 --> 53:57.820
This one's called kitten fur and it's a smell a

53:58.300 --> 54:02.660
wonderful kitten smell from that spot right behind the kittens neck and

54:03.340 --> 54:08.260
It's wonderful feelings. There's nothing no breakdown. It just smells like cat from the grumpy cat

54:08.260 --> 54:10.900
I don't love the idea of someone knowing

54:11.940 --> 54:15.900
Where the best smelling part of their cat is that's it just a level of

54:17.060 --> 54:20.380
Intimacy that I don't I don't I don't much agree with

54:21.100 --> 54:25.740
Would you like to smell like the love of Tim McGraw? Yeah, this one

54:26.380 --> 54:28.220
soul to soul

54:28.220 --> 54:36.260
Tim McGraw two-piece set a two-piece sets much like Tim McGraw and faith Hill whose love everlasting love is

54:36.260 --> 54:39.740
is captured finally in a great juice a

54:40.420 --> 54:47.020
Spray juice as we call it in the industry. This is inspired by faith healing Tim McGraw's classic

54:47.740 --> 54:52.120
American love story soul to soul is a number

54:52.860 --> 54:54.860
So it's kind of oh that is cool

54:55.540 --> 54:57.540
Tim McGraw captures

54:57.580 --> 55:01.660
Soul to soul Tim McGraw captures Tim's modern confidence

55:01.660 --> 55:08.220
Balanced with the classic romance Tim and faith represent his his modern competence as a lover

55:08.980 --> 55:12.780
It's a lover the fragrance opens with sensual spices

55:13.540 --> 55:18.420
Balanced with a brandy accord. That's the foreplay baby a brandy accord

55:18.780 --> 55:26.660
The heart is a classic blend of woods with hints of exotic herbs that lead to a sexy yet rugged

55:26.660 --> 55:32.380
That's the fucking and then the cool down, okay, yeah you get that pumping

55:35.220 --> 55:38.700
Tim's got everything for you this fragrance that him and

55:39.060 --> 55:44.220
Faith Hill shared together with their love. It smells like the room after they've seen it. Does that

55:44.860 --> 55:50.580
Particular spray juice come with a cowboy hat shaped lid because some of his earlier ones did

55:51.540 --> 55:55.260
This one is a little more upscale. Okay, okay. I

55:55.260 --> 56:01.460
Got them. I got this next one. I got to just show you guys. Well, okay, that's gonna be tough

56:01.460 --> 56:04.260
I show it that's in the computer. Hold on

56:05.860 --> 56:11.360
Don't start it just oh, yeah, I'm gonna play the audio and we'll watch it together, right?

56:12.460 --> 56:14.460
Don't say anything cuz I'm gonna unmute

56:14.460 --> 56:24.460
Ready? Ready? Three, two, one go

56:44.460 --> 56:46.460
Oh

56:59.180 --> 57:00.620
Philippine

57:00.620 --> 57:03.300
Limits the fragrance for the loaded

57:04.060 --> 57:08.020
So that's a Philip line. I've never felt dumber

57:08.020 --> 57:13.860
Asking the question. I'm about to ask who is that? Yeah, he's a he's a German

57:15.260 --> 57:21.420
German fashion designer. It's like a lifestyle buddy. Well, he's also my he's also my best man

57:24.340 --> 57:28.380
If I ever get to marry Philip and I agree we go be each other's best man

57:28.380 --> 57:34.300
If we don't have anybody if we've not found anybody to love by the time we're 27 we get married to each other

57:34.300 --> 57:38.060
This is the deal now the deal that we made. Wait, how old are you?

57:39.020 --> 57:45.100
24. Okay, I got three years and I you know, I do I end up married to Philip. It's not so bad

57:45.100 --> 57:51.100
It's a beautiful house and a great lifestyle that seems to really respect women in a major way. Yeah, sure

57:51.940 --> 57:53.940
that that ad seems to

57:54.860 --> 58:02.580
Put a lot of stock and people being excited about it being Philip plying and there were some things obviously the the thesis of that

58:02.580 --> 58:05.740
That video and I suppose the smell itself is this is

58:06.460 --> 58:08.460
Cologne for people with a lot of money

58:09.300 --> 58:11.580
Is a fragrance for the load, right?

58:11.580 --> 58:16.780
But there were also things that people were doing with money in that video that I don't think anyone

58:17.140 --> 58:24.660
Especially wealthy people do with money like at one point a woman was just rubbing money on a car and I don't yeah

58:24.660 --> 58:26.660
I don't know like to clean it clean

58:28.620 --> 58:30.300
Notoriously dirty

58:30.300 --> 58:35.900
Yeah, also the the fragrance it looks like a credit card. Yeah, that's true

58:35.900 --> 58:36.180
Yeah

58:36.180 --> 58:42.540
That part of it is definitely badass do super rich people often carry their money around and those guns that shoot money out

58:42.540 --> 58:46.420
Is that like a normal rich person thing? Hey, how much was that? Yeah, you got it

58:47.420 --> 58:54.620
There you go, man. That's four hundo right there. Enjoy. I guess it's how you pay for it. Listen. Hey, hey Richard

58:54.620 --> 58:56.140
What do you think just quick question?

58:56.140 --> 59:02.020
Do you think that 2022 will be the year that my brother my brother to me answers more than one question per episode?

59:02.020 --> 59:04.020
Or do you think that that's just gonna remain?

59:04.860 --> 59:06.860
Just to remain like a normal

59:07.260 --> 59:08.900
trajectory for us

59:08.900 --> 59:14.900
What don't worry about it. Don't worry about it Richard. Hey, listen, I got one more to tell you about this one

59:14.900 --> 59:18.100
You're gonna have to search it out on the bay on the bay

59:18.100 --> 59:25.340
A bay. Oh, okay. Why it's a auction site. What cuz it listen

59:25.740 --> 59:30.780
This one's like you didn't hear about this from me. Oh, this is like dark stink

59:31.900 --> 59:37.860
Yeah, this is like other grounds think this is traded this fragrance is traded because it's a league

59:37.860 --> 59:42.140
Oh, it's like a cryptic smell. Yeah, so right. So the year is

59:42.140 --> 59:48.580
2004 it is Jessica Simpson is burning. It's a story man

59:49.420 --> 59:55.980
Come on, Jesus. Forgive me Jesus. I am so sorry for taking your name in vain. You're my blessed Savior apologies

59:56.420 --> 59:58.880
So so it's 2004, right?

59:59.460 --> 01:00:06.260
Jessica Simpson is burning up the charts and burning down our hearts with a great reality show with Nick Lachey and

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.460
probably

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:12.780
Look of hazard. Yeah. Yeah, that was probably around then so then

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.380
Jessica Simpson launched desert beauty

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:21.740
Right desert. It's a lot. No, listen, this is the thing about it. Okay

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.940

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.020
Lot of bombers maybe

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.900
Well a lot of stinkers. I bet it was Nick

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.740
And a lot of people got kind of sick

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.980
Based based on dessert beauty. Well, no one could have seen that coming

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:06.060
You know what I mean? Like that could have happened to anyone eating perfume makes you sick couldn't who knew who knew?

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:12.460

Simpson is being shown some of the products from the range clearly for the first time and has no idea about any of them

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:38.100
Upon being shown the whipped body cream and told it's a moisturizer Simpson responds. So it moisturizes, huh?

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.740
Then we watch Simpson post seductively with a cupcake

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:49.220
progressively being forced to eat more and more icing until she feels so ill she ends up crouched on the bathroom floor eating crackers her mother

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:54.540
Brought her and then she throws up for three hours. It's a poison. She's

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:07.140
To everyone and then she gets sued and if you can't get it anymore, but here's the thing about this shit

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:12.720
It smells so good. That's it. That's a problem about deliciously kissable belly button

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.540
Fragrance it smells so good

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:23.700
That a lot of people think it's creamy and yummy warm vanilla berry. No, don't eat it. Oh, wait a minute to which

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.380
Sense, is it creamy?

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.780
It's just like regular creamy shit one reviewer

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:36.860
Wrote on makeup alley.com 17 years ago yet another product

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:44.020
I wasted my money on the smell is faint and which is a good self-burn. You did it again user

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.340
Shaq the cat

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:53.540
Shaq the cat you wasted more money. The smell is faint lasts only a few minutes and who would want to lick a belly button?

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.060
Can I say though it sounds like shitty perfume but

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:03.940
I'm glad that the smell is faint if I'm eating it, you know what I mean?

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.780
Like I can't eat you can't eat perfume

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:12.060
So they that certain certain compromises had to be made but it also makes you sick though

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:15.060
So they didn't compromise that much. It doesn't make you pretty sick. I

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:20.060
Received juicy in a sample size and the smell was nice and sweet

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:26.820
It only stayed on me for about one minute and then faded while I got the leftover sticky mess on my wrist and neck not to

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.660
Mention I was followed everywhere by me man. Do not purchase this

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:36.740
So yes, this is no longer on the market and I kid about Jessica seems in poisoning people is clear

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:42.620
She has no idea what these products and it seems like she's having something of a renaissance. So I'm

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:48.980
