WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.260 --> 00:50.260
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
It's better it's better with you

01:02.260 --> 01:09.540
It's better it's better with you

01:10.780 --> 01:15.780
Hello everybody and welcome to saw bones and marital to you are a misguided man

01:18.460 --> 01:24.380
Just didn't hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

01:25.820 --> 01:29.260
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle. It's probably

01:29.260 --> 01:31.260
a little pregnant

01:32.260 --> 01:37.740
That positive right now with triplets. I'm your middlest brother Travis the effervescent

01:39.020 --> 01:43.980
Oh McElroy, do you stop saying your last name and it's like that's our fucking brand dog

01:43.980 --> 01:49.940
No, but like that's how a flourish works like Peter the Great wasn't like I'm Peter Smith the great

01:50.940 --> 01:52.600
That wasn't it

01:52.600 --> 01:55.500
I'm Griffin McElroy this the youngest of them and

01:55.500 --> 02:01.020
So glad so glad to be here. I just want to say I just want to take this opportunity. It's from a heart

02:01.020 --> 02:05.780
I just want to apologize to you too. I've been watching a lot of in Canto lately

02:05.940 --> 02:06.440
Yeah

02:06.440 --> 02:10.920
and it makes me realize how hard it must have been for you guys to grow up in my shadow because I'm kind of like

02:10.920 --> 02:15.540
A mix of like both Louisa and Isabel strong and perfect. Yes, exactly

02:15.540 --> 02:20.900
And I'm it's making me realize now how much you guys must have felt like I don't like a Bruno

02:21.500 --> 02:22.700
or

02:22.700 --> 02:27.020
Maybe you know like even like a Mirabelle just completely no power

02:27.020 --> 02:33.200
I felt more like one of the dirty rats that lived in the walls. That's just like nobody gave a shit

02:33.200 --> 02:39.100
I feel like I feel like Kirk McElroy is the Bruno right like cuz we don't talk about Kirk

02:39.100 --> 02:41.220
No, no and Kirk live in the walls

02:43.220 --> 02:45.220
Little Griffin the rat. Yeah

02:46.460 --> 02:49.660
He'll tell you that but don't ask him Kirk kicked ass

02:49.660 --> 02:55.060
I did like kicking it with him cuz he was like way more loosey-goosey than the than the rest of y'all

02:55.060 --> 02:59.260
He's kind of one of us that's pissed off about cancel culture. You know, I mean like

03:00.300 --> 03:02.540
We curbs that vibe Kirk gives off. I do

03:03.780 --> 03:05.780
crypto and he keeps calling it curbed oh

03:06.860 --> 03:10.580
And then he moved out and he's he's high on the hog at this point

03:10.580 --> 03:16.980
he has a dinner plate and he like always has it on him and I'm like, yeah, what's up and he's like

03:16.980 --> 03:23.020
a Bitcoin and I say no and then he shows me that he did draw a dollar sign on it. Yeah, and there's

03:23.820 --> 03:28.820
And that there is bite marks all over. Yeah that he put on that he put in there. That's Kirk

03:31.500 --> 03:36.620
We've had so many fictional brothers, which is so cool whenever we post a picture of us with

03:37.180 --> 03:44.580
Any person who's not us and they're like, oh, there's Kirk. So I've just stopped taking pictures of people who aren't you two?

03:44.580 --> 03:48.300
Yeah, it confuses even my children in a big way

03:48.300 --> 03:52.740
Especially if you do a photo of the two of us of two of us with one of them not in there

03:52.740 --> 03:57.460
But somebody else is there and they're like man Travis looks fucking buck wild and it's like that's

03:59.260 --> 04:02.740
Travis doesn't look as strong and perfect as he usually does. Yeah

04:03.540 --> 04:08.920
He's not covered in donkeys and flowers like he normally is right because you're a fusion of the

04:08.920 --> 04:17.520
I'm not saying I'm literally a fusion Griffin. I'm like, it's not like there was some kind of like transporter accident and it combined

04:18.080 --> 04:22.260
Luisa and Isabella, I'm saying that I represent

04:22.680 --> 04:29.880
The strength and perfection of both of them. Yeah, you guys are struggling to come out from under my beautiful perfect shadow

04:30.720 --> 04:34.000
I have an unrelated announcement. Okay, I

04:34.840 --> 04:37.480
have an announcement for all the

04:37.480 --> 04:42.240
Listeners of this program all of them and the haters and the haters

04:42.760 --> 04:46.560
No, just listeners. I now know uh-huh

04:47.440 --> 04:53.920
That dr. Pepper. Yeah is making a berries and cream flavor. Oh, I have this information

04:54.360 --> 05:01.520
Okay, I have the information from you and you and you and you and you you and you

05:02.320 --> 05:04.920
okay, I got it. Yeah, they're making a I

05:04.920 --> 05:09.360
Let that go that part of myself is in the past

05:09.640 --> 05:12.960
yeah, I am moving on to new projects much like

05:13.480 --> 05:18.760
Gordon Lightfoot stop playing the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald because he didn't want it to overshadow the rest was great

05:18.760 --> 05:25.040
It's the rest of Gort's gold the launch of the Edmund Fitzgerald, which was the prequel he wrote right and the model of the

05:27.160 --> 05:29.080
Will never crash

05:29.080 --> 05:33.420
Nothing is ever going wrong with this bitch. Hey wait, Gordon

05:33.420 --> 05:35.420
I don't think that's what we would say

05:37.960 --> 05:39.400
Terminology

05:39.400 --> 05:41.400
Gordo didn't make that one up

05:41.760 --> 05:43.360
Gordo I think

05:43.360 --> 05:46.640
further alienating our listeners, but no like

05:47.680 --> 05:50.800
Yep, I got it. You don't have to tweet it

05:50.800 --> 05:56.000
But just it or Facebook it or or signal it or gab

05:56.000 --> 06:03.160
I just have it. You don't put it on parlor for me anymore. I got it. No more periscopes. No, no, no

06:03.840 --> 06:05.880
Got it run to all of it

06:05.880 --> 06:06.600
I got it

06:06.600 --> 06:10.520
But Justin you can't shut down the pipeline that has served you so well like

06:10.760 --> 06:15.040
Charlotte combs never went to the bigger street or regulars and just like I get it. Somebody's murdered

06:18.080 --> 06:24.400
It's just I can't I can't explain to you guys what it feels like I know we've addressed this topic before

06:24.400 --> 06:27.160
But now when corporations are gonna make

06:28.320 --> 06:33.640
Mondo money off of this and it's like thank you Justin. Thank you for this great corporate. Give it

06:33.640 --> 06:38.320
It's like you're for to give you should have thought about that. Yeah before you accepted all that money from dr

06:38.320 --> 06:40.680
Pepper to launch the berries and cream sounds on

06:41.160 --> 06:48.480
TikTok so that they could launch this it's all been building for this and now you're biting the hand that feeds you and and drinks you

06:48.480 --> 06:53.520
Um anyway, oh, you're just not gonna address. I'm not

06:54.760 --> 06:56.760
berries and creamy

06:56.760 --> 07:03.120
I'll just say this. I think that's that sounds like a kick-ass flavor. It sounds good. It sounds really good

07:03.120 --> 07:06.840
They need it in a diet though. I don't I died. Dr. Pepper's

07:09.080 --> 07:13.200
Berries and cream zero, I'd never drink anything else. I get out of here now Justin

07:13.200 --> 07:17.320
You said you do other things and I would like you to list some of them, please. Yeah. Yeah

07:17.320 --> 07:23.560
I get remember I used to do the doll thing. Yeah, that was like that. Yeah, okay. I got a

07:24.280 --> 07:25.760
I

07:25.760 --> 07:32.360
Got a shorty award in 2008 for what for a tweeter? Yeah, I was the AP

07:34.360 --> 07:40.200
Regional AP award winner for my business writing and the regional AP Awards

07:40.200 --> 07:47.480
I had a really good Facebook memory about that back from 2008 that you posted on my Facebook wall a link to your shorty award and

07:47.480 --> 07:52.000
You said something like eat my balls or something. Yeah, it was we both up for that

07:52.000 --> 07:54.120
I don't think we were both up for it

07:54.120 --> 07:59.280
But I think I know word for how good a single tweet was it's so fun when you think about how different

07:59.600 --> 08:06.720
things things were what is that 14 years ago that you won a shorty award and you were the type of person that went on your

08:06.720 --> 08:10.160
younger brother's Facebook wall and posted a

08:10.640 --> 08:13.320
Link to your shorty award and just said eat my balls

08:13.920 --> 08:18.900
Different time. I will say though in 2008 that could have been a reference to the hit meme

08:19.560 --> 08:27.040
About different characters eating your balls. Yeah, it definitely was that but still I don't think that changes the point that the odds were a different

08:27.040 --> 08:28.800
Time would you do that now Justin?

08:28.800 --> 08:36.880
Would you win an award for a tweet you wrote and then go on Griffin's Facebook page and post a link to that award? I

08:36.880 --> 08:39.720
Think you'd probably get like a scarf my ass. Oh

08:40.440 --> 08:41.480
Yeah

08:41.480 --> 08:46.720
Scarf huff my farts kind of deal. Yeah, it's huff my farts harder edge

08:49.160 --> 08:56.600
Seems like much more of a commitment like if someone's gonna eat some balls versing huffing farts huffing farts could almost be a passive

08:56.600 --> 09:04.240
Sorry, I found it. This was from February 12 2009 and Justin posted a link to a CNN article about the Shorty Awards, which

09:04.840 --> 09:12.040
Wow, it's pretty wild and he just put any just wrote and on his younger brother's wall on Facebook for everyone to see

09:12.400 --> 09:14.480
Suck on this Wow

09:15.800 --> 09:19.480
Suck on this CNN article that doesn't even load anymore

09:19.480 --> 09:21.480
I

09:25.360 --> 09:29.320
Don't know man, you've been rooting against me like I don't remember this

09:30.200 --> 09:31.640
working for

09:31.640 --> 09:34.160
Polygon or joystick at that point. It's

09:34.680 --> 09:39.680
It's I forget the timeline, but I did I guess that made me feel small Justin

09:39.680 --> 09:41.960
I just want to say there's a part of me

09:42.160 --> 09:48.240
Why didn't you post on my wall that I could suck on your shorty award was I not on the social media at this point?

09:48.240 --> 09:54.720
Was I not probably not you're too busy in college or something. I listen in 2009 Justin. I was 24

09:55.080 --> 10:00.800
Yeah, you did go back there for a bit. Oh, yeah. Oh wait. I did didn't I did? Yeah, you did

10:00.800 --> 10:05.480
Oh you did. Yeah, I did go back to college for a while. That might be true. God good times

10:05.520 --> 10:09.800
Thanks everybody for strolling down this memory lane with us. Yeah, that's gonna do it for us this week's folks

10:09.800 --> 10:12.900
Oh, no, no, we're ahead of I sure we're gonna help people. Yeah, okay

10:13.240 --> 10:17.400
I'm gonna visit my sister next month. And while I'm there I use her guest room

10:17.400 --> 10:24.640
Yeah, one problem her sheets suck. They feel like burlap. Would it be rude to gift her sheets for the guest bed or

10:25.520 --> 10:29.720
Any advice y'all could give thanks. That's from sleepless in San Antonio

10:31.160 --> 10:33.480
Now listen it is it is

10:34.480 --> 10:40.440
Fine to give a host a gift. So you could be like and I brought my own sheets now. Here's the thing

10:41.920 --> 10:45.200
Unless your your sister is completely obtuse

10:45.200 --> 10:50.520
It will be pretty obvious. Yeah, pretty clear. I brought these sheets for me to sleep on

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Go ahead and put them on now, please

10:53.560 --> 10:55.160
I'll wait

10:55.160 --> 10:58.880
It can't be a preference thing, right?

10:58.880 --> 11:04.680
I'd like I prefer burlap like nobody I it they've got to be sleeping on some

11:05.640 --> 11:11.840
Silky stuff and yeah, I don't think that I just don't think they care. Yeah, they're it's a guest bed

11:11.840 --> 11:16.800
It's getting used to what maybe maybe once a month. Maybe probably never used

11:16.800 --> 11:21.320
I mean, it's a very good chance that she doesn't know see this is why drug communication is so important

11:21.560 --> 11:27.800
You got to go in and just say hey, I I love you as a person your guest bed sheets are trash

11:27.800 --> 11:30.240
I mean, they're trash. That's one that's one option

11:30.240 --> 11:35.200
another option is you show up day one and you're like ghost costumes and

11:35.680 --> 11:39.600
Then you have her put on those and so she can feel it all over her body

11:39.600 --> 11:44.520
And then when you guys are done playing ghost costumes and scaring people around the neighborhood saying that you're a ghost

11:44.960 --> 11:46.200
She can be like, you know what?

11:46.200 --> 11:50.680
I just had these on my body when I was pretending to be a ghost earlier and they suck

11:50.760 --> 11:55.700
They're terrible. It doesn't matter because there will be holes cut in them. The problem has solved itself with ghost costume now

11:56.200 --> 12:02.540
Hold on. It depends where the holes are put because what two holes that's gonna stop you from using sheets. Come on

12:02.540 --> 12:09.340
Mr. Moneybags, I didn't realize that two holes was all it took before you stopped using sheets

12:09.500 --> 12:15.580
No, my my child my also you're not using fitted sheets for those costumes Justin

12:15.580 --> 12:18.380
You'll look like a sack of cash look like grimace

12:18.960 --> 12:21.140
Okay, that's here. That's a good point

12:21.180 --> 12:27.220
You look like a bruised up sack of testicles like grimace and maybe maybe you could help in this

12:27.220 --> 12:33.140
So you get the sheets and you throw them in to the washing machine with some shoes?

12:33.780 --> 12:40.080
Okay, and fabric softener and then you just run them, you know, you run over that shit. Maybe that could like

12:40.940 --> 12:43.700
Soften them up a little bit. So it's a little more pleasant for you

12:43.700 --> 12:46.540
I'm just saying that like if someone came to me if

12:46.860 --> 12:51.700
If one of my brothers the one that I loved the most he came to my house and said hey

12:52.660 --> 12:54.660
Yeah

12:54.660 --> 12:57.380
I think fabric softener works. I

12:58.620 --> 13:01.580
Assume it's acid that breaks down the bonds

13:03.940 --> 13:10.660
I have to be involved in it. It doesn't actually soften it though. It's not magic. I mean it it does softer

13:10.660 --> 13:15.060
So like why do I have to be involved in that? I thought I just reduced static. No

13:16.220 --> 13:18.060
Are you whoa?

13:18.060 --> 13:23.380
Are you serious? What did you okay when you when you put a sheet in the dryer? What's that for?

13:23.380 --> 13:29.580
Well, I I use woolen balls in the dryer. Trust me. I bet you do. What's that supposed to mean, sir?

13:30.060 --> 13:34.620
Nasty dog. Anyway, I'm an adult after works. That's proven. Go ahead Travis

13:34.620 --> 13:38.180
I'm just saying that if the brother that I love the most which now might be evident

13:38.540 --> 13:42.460
Came to my house and said hey these sheets on your guest bed suck

13:42.460 --> 13:46.900
And I brought you other ones to put on there and I'll put them on myself. I'd be like, okay

13:46.900 --> 13:54.160
I don't care like it's like yes, but it really has zero impact on me. And in fact of anything, this is a net gain

13:54.820 --> 13:58.540
Because you brought the sheets you put them on it cost me nothing

13:58.540 --> 14:02.440
You don't you don't even have to you don't even have to say against this sheet

14:02.580 --> 14:09.000
You don't have to say anything bad against the sheets. Hey Becky. I hate to be a pain, but my doctor said

14:09.000 --> 14:12.840
I have Paragribitis. I have to use these prescriptions

14:12.840 --> 14:17.320
Hey, I got special sheets that I'm gonna leave here. There's special sheets that I'll leave here

14:17.320 --> 14:23.440
I'm leaving them everywhere. I could possibly sleep but because of the Paragribitis I have I have to use these prescription sheets

14:23.440 --> 14:30.640
There's also a good chance you could just change out the sheets and like secret away the old sheets and your sister would never

14:30.720 --> 14:35.480
Know never know if anything your sister might one day years from now

14:35.960 --> 14:41.000
Approach this to change the sheets on the guest bed and think are these the sheets I put on the guest bed

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't know. I don't mind

14:44.000 --> 14:45.360
unless

14:45.360 --> 14:53.120
Unless your sister's just crazy about these Shrek ass sheets. Oh, I love exfoliating my guests. Yeah

14:54.800 --> 14:58.920
Hey, can I approach the wizard? I wish you were cool

14:58.920 --> 15:04.400
We got a this one was sent in by so many people and it's it is how to make a Star Wars movie. Oh

15:05.160 --> 15:09.400
Well, oh, yeah. Yeah, just for just for fun

15:09.400 --> 15:15.360
You might like to toy around with making the next big episode in the Star Wars saga using your own home filming gear

15:15.360 --> 15:19.120
I would it won't be as spectacular as Hollywood's special effects

15:19.120 --> 15:24.040
But you assume but provided you focus on the fun of making a movie and use your creativity

15:24.040 --> 15:26.600
You'll enjoy the experience and learn things in the process

15:27.880 --> 15:31.840
Awesome. It probably won't be the next big episode in the Star Wars saga

15:31.840 --> 15:38.360
So you did I feel like you opened with a pretty huge salvo there of like do you want to be Borj Lucas?

15:38.360 --> 15:41.440
And then you like immediately dipped out of that

15:41.720 --> 15:48.280
But I do like that they used they couched it though by saying it probably won't they weren't like this

15:48.760 --> 15:53.000
Definitely won't be the neck. They're like, hey, listen, I'm a fucking no man. Yeah, maybe

15:54.000 --> 15:59.600
Listen, I'm gonna be a friend. It probably won't let's I don't know. Listen, we can do this ourselves

15:59.600 --> 16:05.080
This can be a fun little game that we play. So step one think up some characters

16:05.080 --> 16:09.080
You can't do anything until you got a couple main characters. You don't have to flesh it all out now

16:09.080 --> 16:11.960
Just have enough to build a story around a good guy and a bad guy

16:11.960 --> 16:13.960
Just make sure you have enough to start your plot

16:14.200 --> 16:20.160
Now obviously we could also I mean if it's a next in the series we could use some of the ones society there

16:20.160 --> 16:22.160
This is Chewie's big movie, you know what I mean?

16:22.400 --> 16:26.840
Like that guy hasn't gotten enough to do right we start the problem is if you do that

16:26.840 --> 16:35.720
Then you get in trouble with Lucas and okay come up with new guys a new good guy a new bad guy. Okay? Boy, I'll leave you right alone

16:36.520 --> 16:37.880
spork

16:37.880 --> 16:39.240
No

16:39.240 --> 16:43.320
Spork magnificence. The first name has to be normal, right?

16:44.440 --> 16:48.560
Josh my Josh is great. Yeah, Josh

16:49.120 --> 16:50.480
G

16:50.480 --> 16:53.000
e o s a yeah, right. Yeah

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
That's cool

16:55.080 --> 17:02.180
That's how they spell it on Bova bean, which is the yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This one's Josh dawn Tretter

17:03.040 --> 17:04.160
John

17:04.160 --> 17:08.560
Now that's hitting me a little fantasy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What about

17:10.440 --> 17:14.320
It's got to be something celestial and then a mode of transport

17:15.440 --> 17:17.440
Yeah

17:17.440 --> 17:19.200
Josh Sun truck

17:19.200 --> 17:21.760
Josh Sun runner Sun trucker

17:21.760 --> 17:23.760
Josh Sumner's cool. That's

17:24.880 --> 17:27.060
Pretty good way of making a cool name

17:28.920 --> 17:31.560
Fine it's John John Josh Sun runner

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Well, then we can make if you want we can make the villain like that's John

17:37.920 --> 17:43.360
Trucker and it's very confusing. They're always getting confused everywhere. They go. Dr

17:43.360 --> 17:48.960
Lucas made it easy on us for this one cuz first name is Darth and then the second word is just a nasty sounding word

17:48.960 --> 17:51.680
So Josh Sun runner hates his dad Darth

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
It can't be his dad. That's taken

17:55.080 --> 17:56.720
Darth

17:56.720 --> 17:58.240
Darth

17:58.240 --> 18:04.700
Dark, this is the bad guy. Yeah, dark. What's the good guy? Josh Sun runner? Josh Sun runner?

18:05.240 --> 18:07.240
Darth flippin's

18:10.360 --> 18:15.660
Vader you know what I mean? Like it's gotta be okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Darth scab. Darth shit scan

18:15.660 --> 18:18.380
Dar dar dar dar

18:19.220 --> 18:21.220
well, you can't be Darn-der-dar

18:22.100 --> 18:28.720
Dar-dar Darn-der-dar Dar-dar-dar Dar-dar-dar Dar-dar Dar Denar. Darf Dar Dar sauce

18:36.540 --> 18:38.540
Will Dr. Dar I

18:39.640 --> 18:41.960
See your forces as powerful as my

18:41.960 --> 18:44.960
Wait, is this another villain talking to Darth Dardar?

18:44.960 --> 18:48.960
Are these two villains fighting to see who gets to be Josh Sunrunner's dad?

18:50.960 --> 18:53.960
Your mother loves me more, I want to be your new dad.

18:53.960 --> 18:59.960
Yes, so this is like we're combining Star Wars and Daddy's Home at this point.

18:59.960 --> 19:00.960
Okay, so from Darth?

19:00.960 --> 19:05.960
Dardar-dardar-dardar-dardar. No, please call me Darth Dardar for short.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.960
Darth Dardar versus Darth Scabulous or something.

19:08.960 --> 19:09.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.960
Scabulous.

19:11.960 --> 19:13.960
Darth Scabulous.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.960
Darth Hematoma.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.960
Darth Scabulov.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.960
Oh, love is a cool one to put in there.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.960
Dark Scabulose.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.960
Okay, we can agree that dark Scabulov is the cool one, right?

19:25.960 --> 19:27.960
It's not Darth Dardar.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.960
We're rooting for Darth Scabulov.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.960
Well now, don't assume whom I'm rooting for, Justin.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.960
I'm rooting for the underdog.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.400
You gotta keep the fuel under the fire

19:38.400 --> 19:39.520
under the writer's room.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.520
And that's us right now, so let's keep it going.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.120
Who's writing this down?

19:43.120 --> 19:44.320
Step two, the wiki.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.160
Step two, come up with a plot.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.560
And can we agree that Marisa Tomei's playing the mom?

19:47.560 --> 19:48.400
Can we just establish that now?

19:48.400 --> 19:49.600
Well, I'm not casting her right now.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.440
I'm just in this room.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.280
Oh my god.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.520
Okay, but I can't picture it with-

19:52.520 --> 19:53.360
Okay.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.720
Also, there's no moms in Star Wars.

19:54.720 --> 19:55.560
Only aunts.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.680
That's, okay.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.120
And we can't make Marisa Tomei another aunt.

20:00.120 --> 20:00.960
That is true.

20:00.960 --> 20:01.800
You know what I mean?

20:01.800 --> 20:02.620
That is true.

20:02.620 --> 20:03.460
Okay, so come up with a plot.

20:03.460 --> 20:04.300
Awesome.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.140
Start with the main idea. Got that.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.120
The main conflict of the movie.

20:06.120 --> 20:06.960
We got that.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.140
These two Darths want to beat Josh's dad.

20:09.140 --> 20:12.400
Next, think of some things that could happen along the way.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.160
Okay, okay.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.760
They take him out for a drive in the pod racer.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.600
Yeah.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.180
No, they take him to a pod race.

20:21.180 --> 20:25.840
But Darth Scabulov bets on the pod races.

20:25.840 --> 20:26.680
Awesome.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.200
And that's good or bad?

20:28.200 --> 20:29.440
We don't like that.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.280
Oh, we don't like that.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.120
Well, it's kind of up to the-

20:31.120 --> 20:31.940
Yeah.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.800
Oh, and through a series of misunderstandings,

20:33.800 --> 20:36.540
Darth Dardar is in the race.

20:36.540 --> 20:37.380
Oh, that's funny.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.200
He shouldn't be.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.040
He shouldn't be.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.080
He was looking for the bathroom

20:41.080 --> 20:42.080
and he went in the wrong door

20:42.080 --> 20:44.040
and suddenly he's out there in the pod race.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.280
Okay, focus on a theme of your own.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.960
You might want to make it really original,

20:47.960 --> 20:50.800
like the Great Sith War or the New Republic.

20:50.800 --> 20:51.720
No, that's too big.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.520
That's too much, like that's too much lore for me.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.360
Yeah.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.200
I like this.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.120
I want to establish that this is a quiet time

20:59.120 --> 21:01.280
in this galaxy, far, far away.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.120
Right? Sure.

21:02.120 --> 21:02.960
Everything's pretty much,

21:02.960 --> 21:05.640
I'm not even going to say simmering at this point.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.920
This is just like, everyone's like,

21:06.920 --> 21:08.520
well, I don't feel like doing anything right now.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.800
So the Darths have some free time for romance.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.640
Yeah, to fuck around.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.480
Okay, so step three is-

21:13.480 --> 21:14.720
They're not fucking around, Griffin.

21:14.720 --> 21:15.800
They're looking for love.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.500
Right, and all the wrong places.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.960
And this next step is going to really be in our wheelhouse

21:19.960 --> 21:21.240
because it's the literal next step

21:21.240 --> 21:22.400
in this WikiHow article.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.000
And it does say, make it funny.

21:25.000 --> 21:25.840
Oh, hell yeah.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.400
Humor will improve the amateur-

21:27.400 --> 21:28.920
Keep your grades up.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.000
Keep your grades up, make it funny.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.040
It'll improve the amateur moving,

21:32.040 --> 21:33.800
allowing for much forgiveness

21:33.800 --> 21:35.320
for the amateur setting and storyline.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.000
Add a few jokes and punchlines to your movie.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.240
It wouldn't be a good one without it.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.840
Make sure that you understand people's styles

21:39.840 --> 21:41.240
and make the humor fit each of them.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.280
Here's an example scene they have.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.100
Rebel 1 and Rebel 2 are walking.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.420
Rebel 1 collapses.

21:46.420 --> 21:48.440
Rebel 2 calls for his commanding officer.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.800
Rebel 2, sir, my partner collapsed and is not breathing.

21:51.800 --> 21:52.640
What should I do?

21:52.640 --> 21:55.680
Commander, make sure he is dead, then tell me.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.280
Rebel 2 shoots Rebel 1.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.440
Rebel 2, now what?

21:59.440 --> 22:00.600
Oh my God.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.120
That's a killer. Wow.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.400
That person's dead now. Hey, can I punch up that joke?

22:05.400 --> 22:06.240
Yeah.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.960
Rebel 1 collapses.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.320
Rebel 2, I think he's dying.

22:11.320 --> 22:15.000
Rebel 1, nah, it's just I was sleepy and I shit my pants.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.040
Okay. Funny.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.920
That's funny to me too.

22:18.980 --> 22:22.400
You could also have Josh Stargitter.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.360
Sunrunner. I forgot his name.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.360
Starrunner come up and everybody's like,

22:26.360 --> 22:29.280
wow, fucked up, we just saw a murder on the screen.

22:29.280 --> 22:30.800
But then Josh Sunrunner comes up

22:30.800 --> 22:33.200
and takes the laser out of him.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.000
And now he's okay again.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Oh my God.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.840
Do you know what I mean?

22:36.840 --> 22:38.760
Because then that way you do get the really funny joke

22:38.760 --> 22:39.580
that they come up with,

22:39.580 --> 22:40.840
but you don't have to feel guilty about it

22:40.840 --> 22:42.360
because you watched someone die.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.200
Oh, okay.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.240
Because he took the laser out.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.760
Uh-huh.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.600
So that's cool.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.640
And you might be saying like that,

22:47.640 --> 22:49.960
but that's not an established Star Wars power.

22:49.960 --> 22:54.240
And to that, I would say, watch anything.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.020
Watch any Star Wars shit that's come out

22:56.020 --> 22:57.320
for the last 10 years, guys.

22:57.320 --> 22:59.520
We're just having fun with it at this point.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.360
Yeah.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.760
Oh, this does occur to me, Griffin,

23:01.760 --> 23:03.000
because we hadn't established,

23:03.000 --> 23:04.680
this is probably knowing Star Wars canon,

23:04.680 --> 23:06.320
something we should have decided early on.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.160
Yeah, sure.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.560
Is Josh a chosen one of some sort?

23:10.560 --> 23:11.400
Of course.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.000
That's the dumbest thing you've ever said on this show.

23:13.000 --> 23:13.840
Yeah, of course he is.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.160
Of course he is, yeah.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.360
So Josh, and also he can turn into a wolf.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.200
Part four.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.080
Hell yeah, dude.

23:20.080 --> 23:20.920
Produces script.

23:20.920 --> 23:21.740
Yeah, dude.

23:21.740 --> 23:22.680
Like a force wolf?

23:22.680 --> 23:24.380
Yeah, of course it's a force wolf, Travis.

23:24.380 --> 23:25.640
That's the second dumbest thing you've said.

23:25.640 --> 23:26.480
Wait, before we move on,

23:26.480 --> 23:27.640
what have we established so far?

23:27.640 --> 23:31.440
Josh Sunrunner is a chosen one.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.760
He is a chosen one.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.600
He is a chosen one.

23:33.600 --> 23:34.440
He is a chosen one.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.360
He is the nephew of.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.880
He's got a, there has to be some,

23:37.880 --> 23:39.380
like you gotta have something set up

23:39.380 --> 23:42.000
so that in episode, like the third or fourth episode

23:42.000 --> 23:44.480
of this show, like fucking Greedo walks in

23:44.480 --> 23:45.640
and everyone's like, ooh!

23:46.880 --> 23:48.160
And that's them nutting.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.560
Yeah, he's Grogu's nephew.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.400
He's Grogu's.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.220
No, no, no, no, no.

23:53.220 --> 23:55.840
I don't want tied up with the Mandalorian-verse.

23:55.840 --> 23:56.680
Like.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.500
Yeah, it's gotta be its own.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.360
Ooh, even though Timothy Olyphant

23:59.360 --> 24:01.860
is in the Mandalorian-verse.

24:01.860 --> 24:02.960
That's great.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.000
I don't know why that changes the point, like.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.600
Well, he's gonna come in at the end

24:06.600 --> 24:09.520
and sweep the mother-aunt off her feet.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.240
Is he maybe related to Kit Fisto or something?

24:12.240 --> 24:14.140
Oh yeah, or Porkins?

24:14.140 --> 24:14.980
Yeah.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.080
Oh, yeah.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.100
Wedge Antilles, perhaps?

24:18.100 --> 24:21.320
Yeah, he's the Death Star's grandpa.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.400
Anyway, and then the Death Star shows up in the sky

24:23.400 --> 24:26.120
and everyone's like, oh yeah, baby!

24:26.120 --> 24:27.520
I love that big ship.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.160
He's half, well, he's half-Jawa.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.000
He's half-Jawa, he's half-Jawa.

24:30.000 --> 24:30.820
He's half-Jawa.

24:30.820 --> 24:31.660
All right, all right.

24:31.660 --> 24:32.500
He's half-Jawa.

24:32.500 --> 24:33.320
Griffin, you're an architect

24:33.320 --> 24:34.880
in the Star Wars universe specifically with regards to Jawa.

24:34.880 --> 24:38.020
Yeah, I got my fingers all over the Jawa pulse.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.120
Produce a script.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.080
You'll need this for the actors to follow up.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.400
Oh, well, fuck, I didn't know

24:41.400 --> 24:42.940
that was part of writing a movie.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.280
Yeah, it starts to get less fun.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.240
Do you know how fucked up it is

24:45.240 --> 24:46.280
that Griffin's here doing this

24:46.280 --> 24:47.720
and he did actually write

24:47.720 --> 24:50.280
it's part of the Star Wars extended universe?

24:50.280 --> 24:53.280
Yeah, that's why I'm so good at this part.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.600
Oh, okay, that makes perfect sense.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.440
Yeah.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.760
Well, then just break off a couple lines, Griffin,

24:57.760 --> 25:00.040
that feel inherently Star Wars.

25:00.040 --> 25:00.880
You know what I mean?

25:00.880 --> 25:01.720
Like from the script?

25:01.720 --> 25:03.120
Yeah, like what's something that,

25:03.120 --> 25:04.160
because listen, you can't just be like,

25:04.160 --> 25:05.200
hey, how's it going, man?

25:05.200 --> 25:07.040
That's not what someone in Star Wars would say.

25:07.040 --> 25:07.880
Sure, sure, sure.

25:07.880 --> 25:08.700
So, like, what's a Star Wars-y way there?

25:08.700 --> 25:11.720
Okay, so this is like, episode, this is the pilot.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.560
Yeah.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.380
Because I just decided it's on Disney Plus,

25:13.380 --> 25:15.100
this series, and it's not a movie.

25:15.100 --> 25:19.920
And Josh Sonaraj is like, I just feel something calling.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.820
And he's got like a British accent, right?

25:21.820 --> 25:23.320
So he's like, I feel something.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.360
How old is he?

25:24.360 --> 25:25.920
He's 31.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.760
Okay.

25:26.760 --> 25:30.360
I feel something calling to me from the stars.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.000
Is that Michael Caine?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.080
Let me finish.

25:33.080 --> 25:33.920
Okay.

25:33.920 --> 25:36.120
I feel the stars, there's something in there

25:36.120 --> 25:38.760
moving for me, and I can feel the power grow.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.440
Is that fucking Greedo?

25:40.440 --> 25:41.280
Oh!

25:44.240 --> 25:46.440
Now, wait, is that the sound of Josh nutting

25:46.440 --> 25:47.280
over seeing Greedo?

25:47.280 --> 25:48.720
No, it's him trying to get into a wolf.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.960
Oh, right, of course.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.400
That happens when he nuts.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.520
Let's get some humor in there.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.040
He turns into a wolf when he nuts, like in Teen Wolf.

25:56.040 --> 25:59.040
Yeah, and at this point, I think I've decided

25:59.040 --> 26:01.360
we shouldn't do the two dads thing.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.200
Oh, okay.

26:02.200 --> 26:06.400
Okay, which of the Darceel are you rid of?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.440
Probably Dar-Da-Dar, because that's not gonna,

26:08.440 --> 26:10.000
we can't make toys of him.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.800
Can it be an unrelated storyline

26:11.800 --> 26:14.480
that is happening off-screen that people keep waiting

26:14.480 --> 26:15.600
for it to intersect?

26:15.600 --> 26:16.440
People love the books.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.100
It doesn't even have to be B, I mean, it could be D.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.800
Extras, remember, Star Wars is full of extras.

26:21.800 --> 26:22.800
Gotta find extras.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.920
Hey, guys, we're doing this kick-ass movie

26:24.920 --> 26:26.920
about, can I see the script?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.800
Well, we've got one line written so far.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.640
Yeah.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.640
And we've made some major cuts.

26:33.640 --> 26:34.480
But listen, we-

26:34.480 --> 26:35.320
Yeah!

26:35.320 --> 26:38.480
Okay, I know, I get it, the problems

26:38.480 --> 26:40.440
with only having one line, but if you're like,

26:40.440 --> 26:42.800
be in my movie, and the one line is-

26:42.800 --> 26:44.000
Kicks ass like that.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.880
I feel something calling to me from the stars.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.400
Is that Greedo, a wolf howl?

26:49.400 --> 26:50.240
Yeah.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.060
Like, I'm in.

26:51.060 --> 26:52.840
You can sell that shit in the room.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.880
You don't have to give a script to the extras.

26:54.880 --> 26:55.720
They don't have lines.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.200
No way, no way.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.000
They just are gonna react to Josh turning into a wolf,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.320
and that's what we're selling this series on.

27:02.320 --> 27:07.160
It's first full, oh my God, this next part beats ass.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.840
All right, this is creating the backdrop and effects, okay?

27:09.840 --> 27:11.320
Part one, make a set.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.280
You'll need at least one set to film against.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.120
Yeah.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.780
If you live near a city or in one,

27:15.780 --> 27:18.000
you could make it in Coruscant.

27:18.000 --> 27:18.840
Awesome.

27:18.840 --> 27:19.680
Huh.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.080
What, where do you live?

27:21.080 --> 27:21.920
Cleveland.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.640
You can make Cleveland look like Coruscant.

27:23.640 --> 27:24.480
Easy.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.300
Yeah.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.140
Easy.

27:26.140 --> 27:26.960
One to one.

27:26.960 --> 27:27.800
Just film the tops of the buildings, one to one.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.180
If you live in the woods, it would be a good idea

27:29.180 --> 27:31.760
to make the movie in Kashyyyk or indoor.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.600
Indoor.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.420
Yeah, of course.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.260
Yes, obviously.

27:34.260 --> 27:35.080
Obviously, you didn't need as many.

27:35.080 --> 27:38.020
If you live in Arizona, in parentheses, desert,

27:38.020 --> 27:39.720
you could make it on Tatooine.

27:39.720 --> 27:40.560
Awesome.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.380
If you're in the mountains-

27:41.380 --> 27:43.760
But I wanna create a new planet.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.720
Mountains can be Hoth, big field can be Naboo.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.240
If you live near a swamp, make it Dagobah.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.080
Welcome.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.320
This is my planet, Backyardia.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.880
I mean, it looks just like it's someone's backyard.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.620
And these are the Backyardigans.

27:56.620 --> 27:57.460
Kip-kip.

27:57.460 --> 28:02.360
I have long been the mayor of Kroger parking lot,

28:02.360 --> 28:03.400
but I am thrilled.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.840
You've made this long journey, Sunrunner.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.880
And it looks like they're asking us to leave

28:08.880 --> 28:11.080
because we didn't acquire any permits.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.480
Let us move to mom's basement here.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.000
It's a storm trooper.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.600
My name is Carl.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.800
Get out of my fucking Kroger's.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.300
Get out of my Kroger's.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.920
Do you wanna be in my movie?

28:22.920 --> 28:23.760
Yeah?

28:24.720 --> 28:25.680
Of course.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.440
There's a lot of lines in this article

28:27.440 --> 28:29.680
that beat absolute ass.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.220
And this is another one.

28:31.220 --> 28:33.120
Step three, find suitable music.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.600
You can play it on your guitar,

28:34.600 --> 28:37.520
but you can make it better by adding the real deal.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.360
Hell yeah.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.800
What?

28:39.800 --> 28:41.080
Hell yeah, dude.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.960
Get some real jizz in there.

28:42.960 --> 28:46.320
Get some real space jizz in there would be so cool.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.120
But how much cooler would Star Wars have been

28:48.120 --> 28:48.960
if it was like,

28:48.960 --> 28:52.460
down to the down, down, squirrely, woo, woo, woo.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.300
And people would be like,

28:53.300 --> 28:55.160
well, this isn't the real deal music

28:55.160 --> 28:57.240
because it's just a guitar, but damn.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.080
That's good.

28:58.080 --> 28:58.900
But what if it was more like,

28:58.900 --> 29:02.080
boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

29:02.080 --> 29:02.920
Oh, that's good.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.480
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

29:05.480 --> 29:09.000
Do you think that George went to John,

29:09.000 --> 29:10.960
did John Williams do the Star Wars?

29:10.960 --> 29:11.780
He did, right?

29:11.780 --> 29:12.620
He did some of it.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.460
He did some of it.

29:13.460 --> 29:14.760
And then he was like, so he,

29:14.760 --> 29:15.600
and George was like,

29:15.600 --> 29:17.960
so are we new to music for this scene in a bar?

29:17.960 --> 29:19.280
And then John Williams was like,

29:19.280 --> 29:20.600
That's a really good George Lucas.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.440
Thanks.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.880
And John Williams was like,

29:22.880 --> 29:23.960
okay, I think it'll be like,

29:23.960 --> 29:26.320
buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.220
And then George Lucas was like,

29:27.220 --> 29:28.780
no, make it stupid.

29:28.780 --> 29:31.720
Like, beep, beep, beep, beep, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.520
Make it sound like a child's toy.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.160
Make a dumb, like dumb jizz.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.000
What?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.260
What'd you call it, George?

29:38.260 --> 29:39.600
Did you mean to say jazz?

29:39.600 --> 29:42.240
Uh, no, I meant jizz.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.360
I wasn't thinking of jizz when I said that.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.960
That's what they call it in space.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.480
Wait, George, you're saying that they call music jizz

29:49.480 --> 29:51.200
and say, yeah, I'm George Lucas.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.280
I gotta go work on Howard the Duck.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.800
The only thing wilder than the moment

29:55.800 --> 30:00.480
that a person learns that George Lucas called the music jizz

30:00.480 --> 30:01.920
is the music that George,

30:01.920 --> 30:04.120
is the moment that George Lucas learns

30:04.120 --> 30:05.880
that semen is called jizz.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.760
That would be the only thing wilder than-

30:07.760 --> 30:08.580
That's it too?

30:08.580 --> 30:10.860
Is it too late to, oh, what's that?

30:10.860 --> 30:12.280
People will only know about it

30:12.280 --> 30:14.440
if I talk about it in interviews?

30:14.440 --> 30:17.040
Well, I can't stop myself from talking about jizz.

30:17.040 --> 30:17.880
I got it.

30:17.880 --> 30:18.720
When you've got jizz in your heart,

30:18.720 --> 30:20.220
you've gotta let it out.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.040
What's a funny story, isn't it?

30:22.920 --> 30:25.240
Get some actors.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.280
Remember how Harrison Ford flew the Millennium Falcon

30:27.280 --> 30:29.600
in circles just to lose the Imperials in the asteroid field

30:29.600 --> 30:30.680
and the Empire Strikes Back?

30:30.680 --> 30:31.920
Well- Spoilers.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.960
Well, to get characters with good personality like Solo,

30:34.960 --> 30:37.440
you need actors with equally good personalities.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.920
Why do you have to tell us- So Tom Holland.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.720
Tom Holland's, his brother.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.160
Get Tom Holland, get Marisa Tomei.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.880
We're gonna get Robert Downey Jr.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.720
Yes.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.360
Get Zendaya in there.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.600
And of course, what would the film be

30:53.600 --> 30:56.840
with old Josh Sunrutter as Willem Dafoe?

30:56.840 --> 30:58.200
We gotta have him.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.040
We need him.

30:59.040 --> 30:59.860
Gotta get Willem.

30:59.860 --> 31:00.700
This is the thing,

31:00.700 --> 31:01.540
because not a lot of people-

31:01.540 --> 31:03.260
Now wait, now stop the show.

31:03.260 --> 31:07.280
Griffin just said Josh Sunrutter as Willem Dafoe.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.120
Yeah.

31:08.120 --> 31:08.960
That's what it is.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.880
It can't be the other way.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.640
I think the sentence I said was,

31:12.640 --> 31:16.880
what would the film be with Josh Sunrutter as Willem Dafoe?

31:16.880 --> 31:19.320
As if like, I was pitching that to you guys.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.640
Yeah, you're pitching a parody of your own movie

31:21.640 --> 31:22.480
that you haven't made.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I love this.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.920
The rest of this article kind of-

31:24.920 --> 31:27.240
I think it might go a little something like,

31:27.240 --> 31:31.800
now give me a job that Willem Dafoe might not normally have.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.280
Right.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.440
I'm hearing sex therapist.

31:35.440 --> 31:39.040
The rest of this article is boring,

31:39.040 --> 31:41.960
except for there's one last step that says,

31:41.960 --> 31:44.120
create the DVD.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.520
Once you're satisfied,

31:45.520 --> 31:49.080
send the movie to a menu making program like IDVD

31:49.080 --> 31:50.200
or others that work for you.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.720
Make a cool menu design,

31:51.720 --> 31:53.760
then burn your movie to the disc.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.920
This is your prototype.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.120
If you're happy with your movie,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.080
then burn some more.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.280
Sell them on the street or something.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.360
Maybe make a trailer.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.040
If someone came up to you on the street and was like,

32:04.040 --> 32:09.040
hey, do you want to buy for $10 the Star Wars movie I made?

32:09.200 --> 32:11.480
The answer to that will never be no.

32:11.480 --> 32:12.520
It would, yes.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.520
I would actually rather do that

32:14.520 --> 32:15.840
than if someone says like,

32:15.840 --> 32:18.560
I have a bootleg copy of a real Star Wars DVD

32:18.560 --> 32:19.520
for like 10 bucks.

32:19.520 --> 32:23.680
Versus one I made from scratch,

32:23.680 --> 32:28.680
starring Willem Dafoe as himself as Josh's Sunrunner.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.120
His last, we just don't,

32:31.120 --> 32:32.360
I'm changing the movie again,

32:32.360 --> 32:34.280
cause I do feel like I'm taking a sort of

32:34.280 --> 32:36.840
like directorial role at this point.

32:36.840 --> 32:37.680
Does it feel that way?

32:37.680 --> 32:38.520
I would say more,

32:38.520 --> 32:40.200
it feels more like an executive producer to me, but.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.040
Yeah, more of an EP.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.760
Well, here's what I'm thinking is that.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.800
Cause you're constantly kind of

32:44.800 --> 32:45.640
butting in.

32:45.640 --> 32:46.480
Yeah, sure.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.040
Listen, I'm happy just being there to shepherd

32:49.040 --> 32:51.400
what I consider now my baby.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.600
Well, yeah, but I've.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.800
As the writer.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.280
I got my hands on the scissors.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.800
We can co-make it, Trav.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.640
We can be like the Russo.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.600
Did you almost call your brother Charlie?

32:59.600 --> 33:02.080
No, Travis Russo.

33:02.080 --> 33:02.920
Yeah.

33:02.920 --> 33:03.760
And Justin Russo.

33:03.760 --> 33:04.580
Like the Russo brothers.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.600
Yeah, and I can be like a powerful movie producer.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.520
And there's honestly only,

33:08.520 --> 33:10.000
I can't think of too many of them.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.040
And a lot of them are pretty bad people.

33:12.040 --> 33:12.880
Pieces of shit.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.720
Yeah.

33:13.720 --> 33:14.560
So let me just say that.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.280
Are you Kevin Feige?

33:16.280 --> 33:19.040
Well, let me do say this.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.800
No last name for the protagonist.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.080
He's just Josh.

33:22.080 --> 33:22.920
No, I don't like that.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.680
Hey Justin, can you join me over here in my trailer?

33:25.680 --> 33:26.520
Yeah, I'd love to.

33:26.520 --> 33:27.360
Yeah, I'm sure.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.200
And Willem Dafoe as Josh.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.440
I think we gotta cut Griffin out.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.400
No, wait, we gotta give him a different name.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.120
We gotta give who a different name?

33:36.120 --> 33:36.960
Griffin.

33:36.960 --> 33:37.780
You can't just be Griffin.

33:37.780 --> 33:38.620
That's our brother.

33:38.620 --> 33:39.960
He's the producer of the movie.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.720
Yeah, we gotta cut him out.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.560
He needs a new character though.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.440
So we're gonna give Griffin a character

33:45.440 --> 33:47.720
and then cut that character out of the movie?

33:47.720 --> 33:49.200
No, no.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.040
I'm saying in the rich fiction we're developing,

33:51.040 --> 33:52.360
Griffin can't just be Griffin.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.120
Okay, Josh too.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.800
We gotta cut Josh too.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.060
Okay, yeah, I agree.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.280
Let's go back out of our trailer.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.560
Okay, hey, do you wanna handle it?

34:01.560 --> 34:02.900
What'd you just drink?

34:02.900 --> 34:03.740
I'll take care of it.

34:03.740 --> 34:04.580
Griffin.

34:04.580 --> 34:05.840
What do you guys think about Pete Davidson

34:05.840 --> 34:06.960
as a new sort of-

34:06.960 --> 34:08.760
Fuck, wait, hold on, Justin, come back over here.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.360
That's a really, it's a really good suggestion.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.200
It's really good.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.020
It's really good.

34:12.020 --> 34:12.860
Let me talk to Griffin.

34:12.860 --> 34:13.700
Griffin, hey, Griffin.

34:13.700 --> 34:15.960
And he would be like a hutt, like a crazy hutt.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.480
Oh wait, Justin, step back over here.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.320
I don't like that.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.440
I don't think, I don't want,

34:19.440 --> 34:22.120
I want Pete in the movie obviously, but not as a hutt.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.740
That's it, I'm striking out on my own.

34:23.740 --> 34:24.580
What?

34:24.580 --> 34:25.420
It's a solo project now.

34:25.420 --> 34:26.240
No, they already made solo.

34:26.240 --> 34:28.080
I'm producing and directing.

34:28.080 --> 34:32.080
This is my body of evidence.

34:32.080 --> 34:32.920
This is my-

34:32.920 --> 34:35.520
I'm gonna make my own, then I'm making my own movie.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.760
Okay, we'll run them next to each other simultaneously.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.960
Hey, we need to take a quick break.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.520
And then when we get, we're gonna go to the Money Zone

34:42.520 --> 34:43.540
is what is gonna happen.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.080
I mean, that's what's happening.

34:45.080 --> 35:00.360
Oh, I say that might just sound like Babble to you,

35:00.360 --> 35:02.520
but I was actually speaking a foreign language.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.400
And that's because I learned it on Babble.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.160
This is not, that is not a ringing endorsement

35:08.160 --> 35:09.720
for this actual advertiser.

35:09.720 --> 35:13.040
Yeah, unless you're speaking, are you speaking Atlantean?

35:13.040 --> 35:14.360
It's an actual service.

35:14.360 --> 35:18.000
Because I can say it's so edifying

35:18.000 --> 35:19.640
to learn another language.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.520
It can make travel more fun.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.560
It could just keep the fucking neurons firing.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.400
You know what I mean?

35:24.400 --> 35:26.360
Just like make you feel like you're making progress

35:26.360 --> 35:28.640
in your life, even though some other things

35:28.640 --> 35:29.840
might've run aground, you know?

35:29.840 --> 35:32.520
And if one of your other friends knows the language,

35:32.520 --> 35:35.160
you can bad mouth a third friend in front of their face

35:35.160 --> 35:36.280
and they'd never know.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.120
That's so funny.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.080
Babble's 15 minute lessons make it the perfect way

35:39.080 --> 35:41.000
to learn a new language on the go.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.600
Choose from 14 different languages,

35:43.600 --> 35:48.040
including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Pig Latin.

35:48.040 --> 35:48.880
Plus-

35:48.880 --> 35:49.720
Just learn them all at once.

35:49.720 --> 35:50.560
That's what I did.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.400
Just learn them all at once.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.880
Babble's speech recognition technology

35:52.880 --> 35:57.800
helps you to improve your pronunciation and accent.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.560
Yes, I studied English there.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.000
Right now, when you purchase

36:01.000 --> 36:02.480
a three month Babble subscription,

36:02.480 --> 36:05.640
you'll get an additional three months for free.

36:05.640 --> 36:06.600
Get out.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.600
That's six months for the price of three.

36:08.600 --> 36:13.600
Just go to babble.com and use the promo code MyBrother.

36:13.680 --> 36:18.520
That's B-A-B-B-E-L.com.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.120
Code MyBrother.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.360
Babble, language for life.

36:22.360 --> 36:23.200
Hey, Griffin.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.520
Yeah.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.280
It just seems like you got a lot on your mind.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.320
No, I'm doing great, actually.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.160
Yeah?

36:31.160 --> 36:33.720
Yeah, I'm having a pretty good day.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.640
Okay, cause you seem pretty stressed out.

36:35.640 --> 36:36.880
Seem to be stressed out, yeah.

36:36.880 --> 36:40.720
No, guys, I'm doing great.

36:40.720 --> 36:41.840
Well, why don't you take a moment

36:41.840 --> 36:43.040
and just check in with yourself, Griffin?

36:43.040 --> 36:43.920
Don't need to.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.360
I'm awesome right now, actually.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.280
Oh, God.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.280
He's really freaking out.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.400
Griffin, have you considered maybe doing like Calm

36:51.400 --> 36:52.720
to like clear your head

36:52.720 --> 36:55.160
and maybe try some like guided daily meditations?

36:55.160 --> 36:56.440
You could improve your focus

36:56.440 --> 36:58.440
with Calm's curated music tracks

36:58.440 --> 37:02.320
or drift off to sleep with Calm's imaginative sleep stories

37:02.320 --> 37:03.840
for children and adults.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.680
Yeah.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.960
Oh, well, let me try it.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.600
Okay.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.320
Oh, yeah, I was fucked up.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.840
Yeah, I knew it.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.280
I was saying that I was actually good,

37:12.280 --> 37:14.200
but as it turns out, I was pretty fucked up.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.440
I knew it.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.960
Wow, thanks, man. And you at home, too,

38:02.640 --> 38:04.640
Hi, I'm looking for a movie.

38:04.640 --> 38:05.480
Oh, I got you.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.840
There's that new foreign film with the time travel.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.080
There's an amazing documentary

38:09.080 --> 38:10.720
about queer history on streaming.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.400
Have I told you about this classic

38:12.400 --> 38:14.040
where giant robots fight?

38:14.040 --> 38:15.880
Or there's that one that most critics hated,

38:15.880 --> 38:17.720
but I thought it was actually pretty good.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.160
Ooh, I know the one with the huge car chase.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.480
And then there's that scene

38:21.480 --> 38:24.320
where the car jumps over the submarine.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.960
Wow, who are you eclectic movie experts?

38:26.960 --> 38:27.960
Well, I'm Evie Whiteyway.

38:27.960 --> 38:28.800
I'm Drea Clark.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.120
And I'm Alonso D'Arazo.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.320
And I'm Alonso D'Arazo.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.880
And I'm Alonso D'Arazo.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.960
And together we host the movie podcast, Maximum Film.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.800
New episodes every week on MaximumFun.org.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.680
And you actually just walked into our recording booth.

38:41.680 --> 38:42.520
Oh, weird.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.720
Sorry, I thought this was a video store.

38:44.720 --> 38:48.000
You seem like a lady with a lot of problems.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.960
Well, Manolo, we have a show to promote.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.560
It's called Dr. Game Show.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.280
It's a family-friendly podcast

38:58.280 --> 38:59.640
where listeners submit games

38:59.640 --> 39:03.080
and we play them with callers from around the world.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.160
Oh, sounds good.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.600
New episodes happen every other Wednesday

39:06.600 --> 39:08.480
on MaximumFun.org.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.560
It's a fast and loose oasis

39:11.560 --> 39:15.400
of absurd innocence and naivete.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.800
Are you writing a poem?

39:16.800 --> 39:21.000
No, I'm just saying things from my memory.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.200
And it's a nice break from reality.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.160
Is that, are we allowed to say that?

39:26.160 --> 39:27.640
I don't know, it sounds bad.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.240
It comes with a 100% happiness guarantee.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.080
It does not.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.440
Come for the games and stay for the chaos.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.840
I have to do my laundry at a laundromat.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.880
And I often find that people will leave their clothes

39:44.880 --> 39:47.040
in the dryer long after they're finished.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.080
And I need that dryer.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.440
You don't mind know where this is going.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.800
You're gonna throw away their clothes.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.240
You can throw away their clothes in the garbage.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.640
I don't wanna just pull their laundry out

39:55.640 --> 39:57.440
and put mine in, that seems rude.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.240
And the laundry will get wrinkly.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.960
So I fold the clothes and put them on top of the dryer.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.680
I know that's weird, but is it too weird?

40:04.680 --> 40:06.080
No one has caught me yet.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.880
Well, that's not a good followup for the question,

40:09.880 --> 40:11.240
is it too weird?

40:11.240 --> 40:14.480
I have no idea what I would say if someone caught me.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.760
I just don't want their clothes to get wrinkly,

40:16.760 --> 40:20.080
but I also need to use the dryer and I don't wanna wait.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.560
Do I need to stop doing this?

40:22.560 --> 40:26.160
That's from Secretly Folding Laundry in San Antonio.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.440
I don't know.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.720
I'm fucking stumped, man.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.560
I got nothing.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.680
I don't know what weird is anymore.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.920
I've lost all kind of like perspective.

40:33.920 --> 40:34.880
Yeah.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.240
Oh, you know who could help?

40:38.240 --> 40:39.600
Let me call Chris Gethard real quick.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.320
Cause he actually...

40:41.320 --> 40:42.720
He's not gonna take your call.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.400
Well, let me see, hold on.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.840
He's so busy.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.600
I'm dialing.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.840
Beep, boop, beep, boop, beep, beep.

40:50.840 --> 40:55.080
Beep, boop, boop, beep, beep, boop, beep, boop.

40:55.080 --> 40:58.480
Beep, beep, boop, boop, beep, beep, boop.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.480
Wow.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.440
Sometimes it feels like you just dial with your heart.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.880
That was just me making noises with my mouth.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.080
Okay, now I actually call him.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.800
Now I got him on speed dial.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.120
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

41:08.120 --> 41:10.120
That's not what speed dial means.

41:11.440 --> 41:12.840
It also is way too many numbers.

41:12.840 --> 41:13.680
Where is he?

41:13.680 --> 41:14.520
I can't hear him.

41:14.520 --> 41:15.360
Who is this?

41:15.360 --> 41:16.200
I'm really fucking busy.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.040
Who is this?

41:17.040 --> 41:17.880
I told you.

41:17.880 --> 41:18.720
Hi, Chris.

41:18.720 --> 41:23.400
Chris Gethard, welcome to our phone call

41:23.400 --> 41:25.240
that we're having together, a real phone call.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.160
Thank you for calling, but do you know how much

41:27.160 --> 41:28.680
it cost me to get the custom number

41:28.680 --> 41:29.960
when you wish upon a star?

41:29.960 --> 41:34.960
That was supposed to be Boba Blacksheet.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.080
Boy, is my face red.

41:37.080 --> 41:40.600
I think we may have just doxxed you, Chris Gethard,

41:40.600 --> 41:43.200
for our more musically inclined listeners.

41:43.200 --> 41:46.120
Yeah, it's like a vanity plate, but phone number.

41:46.120 --> 41:47.200
Right.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.120
Once I was on TV for the first time,

41:49.120 --> 41:51.400
I demanded the phone company give me

41:51.400 --> 41:54.320
when you wish upon a star as my phone number.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.360
Yeah, yeah, they did it

41:56.360 --> 41:58.920
because you're one of the Hollywood elite, that's right.

41:58.920 --> 41:59.760
Big time.

41:59.760 --> 42:00.760
I'm known for it.

42:00.760 --> 42:01.600
Yeah.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.880
It's synonymous at this point.

42:02.880 --> 42:04.760
When someone's like, you know, like a famous person,

42:04.760 --> 42:06.680
like a Chris Gethard, yeah.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.640
Yes, yes.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.040
And then someone says, who?

42:10.040 --> 42:13.320
And they go, he was on the office after Steve Carell left.

42:13.320 --> 42:16.400
He played Dr. Gary LaMarche on NBC's Blindspot.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.600
Show some respect.

42:17.600 --> 42:22.600
Blindspot isn't Blacklist.

42:23.600 --> 42:24.440
No.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.280
Thank you, Justin.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.720
That's really, that's a helpful mnemonic device I use

42:27.720 --> 42:31.400
to keep Blindspot and Blacklist separate in my mind.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.240
Yeah.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.500
My mother-in-law, for every Sunday

42:33.500 --> 42:34.620
when we'd come over for dinner,

42:34.620 --> 42:37.960
for literally 18 months in a row,

42:37.960 --> 42:40.640
would say, have you guys started watching the Blacklist yet?

42:40.640 --> 42:41.480
I'm thinking about it, man.

42:41.480 --> 42:43.620
It's worth it just for James Spader.

42:43.620 --> 42:44.960
Every time the pitch is the same.

42:44.960 --> 42:45.800
Yeah.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.400
Hey, Chris, we had a laundromat question come up.

42:49.360 --> 42:53.240
You had no way of hearing it,

42:53.240 --> 42:55.400
so I just wanted to sort of recap for you.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.240
Basically, someone wants to use the dryer

42:57.240 --> 42:58.920
at the laundromat, but there's clothes in it,

42:58.920 --> 43:00.840
and they take them out and fold them,

43:00.840 --> 43:02.520
and they want to know if that's okay.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.280
And I just want to get like your take on it,

43:04.280 --> 43:05.320
sort of a, you know.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.120
You're a real clothes horse, and we know that.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.040
Like, you're big into fashion,

43:10.040 --> 43:13.240
and you wear Supreme stuff all the time,

43:13.240 --> 43:14.400
and so we just figured you'd know

43:14.400 --> 43:16.120
your way around a laundromat.

43:16.120 --> 43:19.120
Well, I actually have pretty strong opinions on this.

43:19.120 --> 43:19.960
Okay, cool.

43:19.960 --> 43:23.280
Because I lived in Queens, New York, for many years

43:23.280 --> 43:25.520
in a building that had shared laundry

43:25.520 --> 43:29.600
and way too few machines for way too many residents.

43:29.600 --> 43:30.440
Mm, yeah.

43:30.440 --> 43:34.000
And you are absolutely allowed.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.520
Well, there's like a certain set of social graces

43:37.520 --> 43:38.360
you have to go through.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.340
There's steps you have to take.

43:39.340 --> 43:40.920
You have to go in, you have to realize

43:40.920 --> 43:43.000
that the dryer's sitting there full of laundry.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.360
You have to get kind of huffy about it.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.760
You have to look around.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.960
You have to open the door of the dryer.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.160
Then you have to look around again

43:51.160 --> 43:52.000
to see if anybody's coming.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.280
Shut the door.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.800
Then you have to quietly simmer

43:54.800 --> 43:56.880
that someone has put you in this position.

43:56.880 --> 43:57.720
Wait, wait, wait.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.080
Opening the door and shutting the door.

43:59.080 --> 44:00.980
Is that like a trap, a distraction?

44:00.980 --> 44:01.820
What's the purpose of that?

44:01.820 --> 44:02.960
Is it performative?

44:02.960 --> 44:04.320
Is it to draw attention?

44:04.320 --> 44:06.040
You open it because you realize

44:06.040 --> 44:07.680
you're being put in the bad position

44:07.680 --> 44:09.960
of having to touch someone else's clothes.

44:09.960 --> 44:10.800
Oh, okay.

44:10.800 --> 44:11.640
So you check it out.

44:11.640 --> 44:12.920
You're gonna give them 10 more seconds

44:12.920 --> 44:15.040
to get down here and handle this.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.240
And then you open it again.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.960
But you give it that cursory open,

44:17.960 --> 44:20.100
like I cannot believe another human being

44:20.100 --> 44:23.520
did not set a timer or pay attention

44:23.520 --> 44:25.520
to their timer on their phone or whatever.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.800
They are putting you in a bad position.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.600
And at that point, if they haven't arrived,

44:30.600 --> 44:34.800
you are allowed to toss all of their clothes

44:34.800 --> 44:36.800
into one of those rolly racks

44:36.800 --> 44:38.240
and leave their clothes there.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.640
And I've been on both ends of this.

44:39.640 --> 44:41.760
I've tossed my fair share of clothes into rolly racks.

44:41.760 --> 44:45.240
And I'm not proud to say on one or two occasions,

44:45.240 --> 44:46.800
I've come down to a laundry room

44:46.800 --> 44:49.080
and found my clothes in a dryer and I deserved it.

44:49.080 --> 44:49.920
I deserved that.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.280
And I know that I put that person

44:51.280 --> 44:52.320
through some mental duress,

44:52.320 --> 44:55.560
but never fold another person's clothes.

44:55.560 --> 44:56.400
There you go.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.220
Thank you.

44:57.220 --> 44:58.060
That's serial.

44:58.060 --> 45:00.440
I would rather walk up to someone

45:00.440 --> 45:03.640
at a nice steak restaurant and then reach down

45:03.640 --> 45:05.760
and pick up the steak off their plate

45:05.760 --> 45:07.400
and then set it back down,

45:07.400 --> 45:10.160
then interface with their clothes on such a deep

45:10.160 --> 45:14.880
and intimate level required to fucking Marie Kondo

45:14.880 --> 45:19.320
that shit on such a large scale.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.800
That makes me want to be sick.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.780
And listen, you could say, listen,

45:22.780 --> 45:25.400
one could make the argument that at that moment,

45:25.400 --> 45:28.120
it's the cleanest the clothes could be.

45:28.120 --> 45:31.760
And then you're sullying them with you.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.680
If I came in, and also I like my shirts

45:34.680 --> 45:35.840
folded a particular way.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.120
Yeah, they're going to fold it wrong.

45:37.120 --> 45:38.120
That's what I was going to say.

45:38.120 --> 45:39.120
They're going to fold it wrong.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.880
Not the way, the special way you like to do it.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.400
And also you're going to find out I left

45:42.400 --> 45:43.840
like a paper towel in my pocket

45:43.840 --> 45:45.080
and now there's scraps everywhere.

45:45.080 --> 45:47.480
And you're going to know that I lazily threw my jeans

45:47.480 --> 45:48.320
in there or whatever.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.140
I get it.

45:49.140 --> 45:50.420
You're going to come across like a sweater

45:50.420 --> 45:52.540
that should have been laid flat to dry

45:52.540 --> 45:54.920
that I clearly didn't give two shits about.

45:54.920 --> 45:55.760
And you're going to judge me.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.560
That's my secret shame.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.360
You're not supposed to know about that.

45:59.360 --> 46:02.280
If I came upon a pile of my own clothes

46:02.280 --> 46:07.200
that had been folded by a nameless, faceless stranger,

46:07.200 --> 46:09.060
I would have to throw those clothes away

46:09.060 --> 46:11.320
and I'd have to move out of that building

46:11.320 --> 46:12.960
if it was one of my special buildings.

46:12.960 --> 46:15.240
Because someone would have that on me forever.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.080
Yeah.

46:16.080 --> 46:16.900
Right.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.540
It's just such an invasion.

46:18.540 --> 46:21.080
I mean, for starters,

46:21.080 --> 46:22.960
what if your silky drawers are in there?

46:22.960 --> 46:23.800
You know?

46:23.800 --> 46:24.640
Exactly.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.880
What if your silky, sexy drawers are in there?

46:25.880 --> 46:27.800
Or worse, your lazy day drawers.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.240
Your lazy day drawers.

46:29.240 --> 46:32.020
Like you don't want someone pawing all over

46:32.020 --> 46:33.080
your unmentionables.

46:33.080 --> 46:35.360
That's a huge problem.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.300
And then, you know, also,

46:37.300 --> 46:39.460
what if they do something weird,

46:39.460 --> 46:41.080
like fold your underwear?

46:41.080 --> 46:42.080
Like you don't,

46:42.080 --> 46:44.780
like I would never fold my underwear

46:44.780 --> 46:47.880
in any scenario in my life ever.

46:47.880 --> 46:48.720
Do you roll it?

46:48.720 --> 46:51.000
No, you wad it up and jam it in.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.140
There's no, I'm a finite person with a finite life.

46:55.140 --> 46:56.520
Like I'm not going to fold my underwear.

46:56.520 --> 46:57.760
No one will ever see it.

46:57.760 --> 46:58.880
Like you jam it in.

46:58.880 --> 46:59.700
Yeah.

46:59.700 --> 47:00.540
Now, Chris-

47:00.540 --> 47:01.380
Anything else is a waste.

47:01.380 --> 47:02.880
Do you roll it in or do you wad it up and jam it in?

47:02.880 --> 47:04.500
You wad it up and jam it in.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.160
You can say, just jam it in.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.120
Take yourself a step.

47:07.120 --> 47:09.120
Now, Chris, when you lived in New York

47:09.120 --> 47:10.020
and you had this issue,

47:10.020 --> 47:14.480
did you never just like go out to your window

47:14.480 --> 47:16.240
and put all the clothes on the clothesline

47:16.240 --> 47:17.320
that ran between your building

47:17.320 --> 47:18.560
and the building across from you?

47:18.560 --> 47:20.920
Watch the kids play a stick ball on the street below.

47:20.920 --> 47:23.020
And you hear kitty cats having fights in trash cans

47:23.020 --> 47:25.720
and somebody yelling about a pizza or something.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.040
While the gangs of New York did battle down on the street.

47:28.040 --> 47:28.880
Yeah.

47:28.880 --> 47:29.700
The ice man.

47:29.700 --> 47:31.840
The guy selling, who'd shaved down some ice

47:31.840 --> 47:33.920
off the big block of ice was clanging his old bell.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.760
Oh yeah.

47:34.760 --> 47:35.960
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.880
As they collected dead from the plague, you know.

47:38.880 --> 47:39.720
I'm doing it.

47:39.720 --> 47:40.960
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.240
Every once in a while I'd do that, sure.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.280
Yeah, okay.

47:44.280 --> 47:46.400
Because it seems like I would take advantage of that.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.280
If I get like, I don't want downy fresh clothes,

47:48.280 --> 47:50.040
I want the smell of the city on me.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.680
Like at all times.

47:51.680 --> 47:52.520
Mm-hmm.

47:52.520 --> 47:54.400
And then some detective sidekick,

47:54.400 --> 47:56.240
a little put-upon boy in a newsboy cap,

47:56.240 --> 47:57.080
he'd yell up at me,

47:57.080 --> 47:58.560
hey mister, don't hang those clothes there.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.880
This is a active investigation, mister.

48:01.880 --> 48:02.720
Right.

48:02.720 --> 48:05.900
And you'd say like, I saw something, but I ain't talking.

48:05.900 --> 48:06.740
Yeah.

48:06.740 --> 48:08.840
And then they would come put the screws to you, I imagine.

48:08.840 --> 48:09.680
And also it's good,

48:09.680 --> 48:11.240
because when you put your clothes on on that clothesline,

48:11.240 --> 48:12.520
if someone falls out of a building,

48:12.520 --> 48:14.680
they can land in your unmentionables,

48:14.680 --> 48:17.120
and that's gonna help break the fall and be comical.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.280
I have another problem.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.960
On top of the dryer is the dirtiest place in my house.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.520
It's covered in lint.

48:22.520 --> 48:23.440
That's disgusting.

48:23.440 --> 48:26.120
Now you just in-linted their garments.

48:26.120 --> 48:26.960
That's horrific.

48:26.960 --> 48:28.040
That's the punishment though.

48:28.040 --> 48:30.640
I would say to Chris's point from earlier,

48:30.640 --> 48:33.520
if they wanted to avoid the in-lintening,

48:33.520 --> 48:35.640
then they should have been down there

48:35.640 --> 48:38.680
before the timer ran out, not after.

48:38.680 --> 48:41.080
Like if it's gonna take like 48 minutes or whatever,

48:41.080 --> 48:43.160
you set your timer for 43 minutes

48:43.160 --> 48:44.620
to give yourself time to get down there

48:44.620 --> 48:47.720
and be poised and ready to remove your clothes as,

48:47.720 --> 48:50.280
like your hands should be on the handle when the buzzer goes.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.560
Chris, I have a judgment call for you,

48:51.560 --> 48:53.640
because you have more experience in this.

48:53.640 --> 48:56.760
Less weird, folding someone else's clothes

48:56.760 --> 48:59.560
or taking their clothes and putting them back in the washer.

48:59.560 --> 49:02.200
And when they come down, just like, you must begin again.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.480
Like it needed more.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.000
The cycle starts anew.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.480
Putting them back in the washer is such a fuck you.

49:12.280 --> 49:14.600
I looked at them, they were still dirty.

49:14.600 --> 49:16.340
Had to go one more again.

49:16.340 --> 49:17.440
What if you pulled them out

49:17.440 --> 49:20.200
and then you piece by piece hid them separately

49:20.200 --> 49:22.200
around the room and left a note like,

49:22.200 --> 49:23.960
yes, your clothes are clean and dry,

49:23.960 --> 49:25.520
but it's up to you to find them.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.920
You have all the clues.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.960
That would drive a person truly insane.

49:28.960 --> 49:31.640
If a person came down to the laundry room

49:31.640 --> 49:34.440
in their building and was like, I am positive

49:34.440 --> 49:37.320
I switched these from the washer to the dryer.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.920
Why are they back in the washer?

49:38.920 --> 49:43.920
That's like an Edgar Allen Poe level psychological torture.

49:45.240 --> 49:47.240
We need a third device.

49:47.240 --> 49:51.440
We need a third appliance in the clothes cleaning process

49:51.440 --> 49:53.840
where you wash and then you dry.

49:53.840 --> 49:56.960
And then we need like a proving drawer

49:56.960 --> 49:59.320
where extra clothes can be stored

49:59.320 --> 50:01.640
so that someone else can get down on the washer.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.600
Well, if we're trying to avoid, maybe you just put it in

50:03.600 --> 50:06.000
and it just bounces them around for a while, right?

50:06.000 --> 50:07.200
It's not really doing anything

50:07.200 --> 50:09.800
except they can't settle into wrinkles, right?

50:09.800 --> 50:11.800
It's just keeping them vibrating.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.000
That's good, a vibrator.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.400
We could just call it a vibrator.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.400
Just call it a vibrator.

50:15.400 --> 50:17.720
I feel like wrinkles is a burden.

50:17.720 --> 50:21.200
If you let it go longer than the dryer

50:21.200 --> 50:23.360
and you are not there to get your own dryer stuff out,

50:23.360 --> 50:26.400
promptly, I mean, ideally before the buzzer goes off,

50:26.400 --> 50:29.400
certainly within three to five minutes after it goes off,

50:29.400 --> 50:31.240
if it goes past that window,

50:31.240 --> 50:33.240
wrinkles are your burden to bear.

50:33.240 --> 50:34.920
That's your penance to pay.

50:34.920 --> 50:35.960
And you know that.

50:35.960 --> 50:38.880
And that's part of the social contract of living in a city

50:38.880 --> 50:40.600
where you shared laundry rooms.

50:42.800 --> 50:46.560
If I was on an elevator in a building,

50:46.560 --> 50:48.800
unsure if one of the other people in there

50:48.800 --> 50:52.200
had at some point folded my clothes for me,

50:52.200 --> 50:55.120
I would have to be dead.

50:55.120 --> 50:58.480
I would have to find a way to turn off my heart and my brain

50:58.480 --> 51:02.560
because I would never be able to look anyone

51:02.560 --> 51:03.760
in the eye again.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.840
Wrinkly clothes are an accepted,

51:05.840 --> 51:08.080
everyone knows that when you live in a society,

51:08.080 --> 51:10.040
there's certain actions that have consequences

51:10.040 --> 51:11.720
and not getting to the dryer promptly

51:11.720 --> 51:13.480
means you might have wrinkly clothes.

51:13.480 --> 51:16.520
I'd much prefer wrinkly clothes on my own terms

51:16.520 --> 51:18.680
than folded clothes on someone else's.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.440
And I'll die on that hill.

51:20.440 --> 51:22.400
Also that way, when you're walking around the building

51:22.400 --> 51:23.520
wearing wrinkly clothes,

51:23.520 --> 51:25.160
or if you spot someone else doing it and you're like,

51:25.160 --> 51:26.240
that's them.

51:26.240 --> 51:28.200
I know that's the person who leaves the laundry in there.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.720
Now, Chris, let me ask you this,

51:29.720 --> 51:31.440
cause I'm dying to know.

51:31.440 --> 51:34.680
Would it be better or worse

51:34.680 --> 51:38.240
if the question asker had printed up some business cards

51:38.240 --> 51:40.840
with their face with a picture of them

51:40.840 --> 51:43.200
and their name on it and like their apartment number

51:43.200 --> 51:45.160
that said like, listen,

51:45.160 --> 51:47.240
I don't want you to worry about this.

51:47.240 --> 51:48.080
I did it.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.480
I folded your clothes.

51:49.480 --> 51:52.080
And this is my schedule should you choose to avoid me

51:52.080 --> 51:52.920
for the rest of our lives.

51:52.920 --> 51:54.880
Or like, or it says on there like,

51:54.880 --> 51:59.360
hey, I'm trying to get into business for myself.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.800
Only the first one's free though.

52:00.800 --> 52:04.040
So if you would like this kind of attention to detail

52:04.040 --> 52:08.400
in our white glove service in folding laundry.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.280
If you came down and they were tied up

52:10.280 --> 52:13.080
in some like parchment paper

52:13.080 --> 52:13.920
with like a twine.

52:13.920 --> 52:16.160
Oh, that's so nice, fuck.

52:16.160 --> 52:17.840
Like on a cruise ship when you get them

52:17.840 --> 52:20.360
and they all got the little tags in their basket.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.560
I feel like that's going to turn this from like weird

52:22.560 --> 52:23.400
to ooh la la.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.000
I've got like a fairy godmother.

52:25.000 --> 52:25.840
Yeah.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.760
Chris, what else do you got going on?

52:28.760 --> 52:29.720
What's going on with you, bud?

52:29.720 --> 52:31.360
You want to just stick around and rap for a while?

52:31.360 --> 52:32.480
Just what's going on, bud?

52:32.480 --> 52:33.320
Yeah, what's going on?

52:33.320 --> 52:35.040
What's going on with me?

52:35.040 --> 52:36.120
I'm a dad now.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.640
I got a beard now.

52:37.640 --> 52:38.480
Everything's changed.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.920
Whoa.

52:39.920 --> 52:42.160
Did they happen simultaneously?

52:42.160 --> 52:45.600
I mean, they all tie into a midlife crisis.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.920
That's very clear.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.120
The child triggered a larger midlife crisis

52:49.120 --> 52:51.640
that has now reflected itself in facial hair.

52:51.640 --> 52:52.480
Yeah.

52:52.480 --> 52:54.240
That's why you called your baby Corvette.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.920
I get it now.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.760
I didn't understand.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.920
I actually got a Vespa with the first baby

52:58.920 --> 53:00.480
and then I was like, that was fucked up.

53:00.480 --> 53:01.760
And then with the second baby,

53:01.760 --> 53:04.600
I like reflexively got another Vespa.

53:04.600 --> 53:06.400
Yeah, that was weird.

53:06.400 --> 53:09.240
Now I'll tell you, Chris, when my first was born,

53:09.240 --> 53:10.880
I had a very long beard

53:10.880 --> 53:13.400
right up until she was about nine months old

53:13.400 --> 53:15.920
at which point she was able to make full blown fists

53:15.920 --> 53:18.480
and attempt to remove my beard from my face

53:18.480 --> 53:22.680
at which point I shorn it down to quite a short level.

53:22.680 --> 53:25.440
So just, I am not quite certain how old your baby is

53:25.440 --> 53:26.960
but you've got that to look forward to.

53:26.960 --> 53:28.680
He's about to be three.

53:28.680 --> 53:33.520
And I cannot grow enough facial hair to have him,

53:33.520 --> 53:38.240
he already punches me, kicks me, gales in my face.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.000
He's at that age already where,

53:40.960 --> 53:42.480
I'll tell you the exact window he's in

53:42.480 --> 53:45.600
because I've heard that most kids go through this is,

53:45.600 --> 53:48.080
he can pee in the potty, no problem,

53:48.080 --> 53:50.280
but he gets really embarrassed about pooping.

53:50.280 --> 53:51.560
So he poops in the diaper

53:51.560 --> 53:52.920
and then when you go to change the diaper,

53:52.920 --> 53:54.360
he's humiliated and shamed

53:54.360 --> 53:56.640
and reacts with rage and violence.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.600
That's the exact window.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.080
That's how I feel when I poop too, just like still.

54:01.080 --> 54:03.280
It's gross, it sucks that we have to do that.

54:03.280 --> 54:05.280
It's so weird and our parents told me

54:05.280 --> 54:06.780
I was the only one who did it.

54:08.600 --> 54:10.760
That's fucked up that they said that to you, Trapp.

54:10.760 --> 54:13.080
Yeah, I know, it's really weird.

54:13.080 --> 54:18.080
Hey, you got a new essay coming out from Scribd Originals.

54:18.360 --> 54:20.620
Oh yeah, I'm promoting.

54:20.620 --> 54:22.880
I wrote a thing called Dad on Pills.

54:22.880 --> 54:24.840
It's on a service called Scribd.

54:27.080 --> 54:28.880
It's not quite book length, but it's up there.

54:28.880 --> 54:31.260
You can get an audio book or ebook.

54:31.260 --> 54:34.280
And it's all about, I think a lot of people

54:34.280 --> 54:36.440
of our generation, it's like we're the first people

54:36.440 --> 54:38.160
who started openly saying like,

54:38.160 --> 54:41.760
hey, I take Depakote, I take Xanax, I have anxiety,

54:41.760 --> 54:44.540
I have depression, we're all gonna talk about these things.

54:44.540 --> 54:46.640
But I wrote a thing that's all been all about

54:46.640 --> 54:48.840
how I'm reconciling that with being a dad.

54:48.840 --> 54:53.840
Because a dad, like you're supposed to be a role model.

54:53.840 --> 54:54.840
Mole rattle?

54:54.840 --> 54:55.680
Mole rattle.

54:55.680 --> 54:56.500
A mole rattle.

54:56.500 --> 54:57.340
You're supposed to be a mole.

54:57.340 --> 54:59.200
You're supposed to be a Moe Rocca.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.420
My father was a fantastic orator

55:02.420 --> 55:05.920
and a fine mole rattle for me growing up.

55:05.920 --> 55:09.000
I've spent my whole adult life feeling sort of like broken

55:09.000 --> 55:12.640
and not like a god, I don't feel like a man

55:12.640 --> 55:14.680
by the traditional standards.

55:14.680 --> 55:17.300
And now I have a son, that's ridiculous.

55:17.300 --> 55:18.840
So it's all about that.

55:18.840 --> 55:20.960
And it's pretty funny and I like it.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.960
And it's raw and it's real.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.060
Can I ask you a question, Chris,

55:24.060 --> 55:25.240
that I was struggling with last night?

55:25.240 --> 55:26.080
Sure.

55:26.080 --> 55:26.960
And this is a little more serious,

55:26.960 --> 55:28.200
but we have raised a lot of guesses.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.760
It's not heavy, it's just like one more thoughtful.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.880
My kids are like talking but not communicating.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.520
Just like, you know how kids are just sometimes like,

55:40.520 --> 55:42.200
I just gotta make some noise.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.040
Oh yeah.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.280
And they were both doing it

55:44.280 --> 55:46.440
and I was really getting stressed out

55:46.440 --> 55:49.960
because I get too much like noise, people talking,

55:49.960 --> 55:51.400
and then you're feeding the kids

55:51.400 --> 55:53.500
and it gets like just because of the way

55:53.500 --> 55:55.280
my brain's all put together,

55:55.280 --> 55:58.480
I got like unduly frustrated

55:58.480 --> 56:00.960
and like really in my head about it.

56:00.960 --> 56:05.760
And I really struggled with should I like,

56:05.760 --> 56:08.240
should I tell my kids that like,

56:08.240 --> 56:10.460
it's hard for me when this has happened?

56:10.460 --> 56:13.000
Like, it was a real struggle.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.600
Like I didn't know really how to handle it.

56:14.600 --> 56:17.220
Like I felt weird telling them

56:17.220 --> 56:19.120
that they had to modify my behavior

56:19.120 --> 56:21.720
because of my, you know, mental illness.

56:21.720 --> 56:23.940
And like, I feel like as a parent,

56:23.940 --> 56:25.160
sometimes I have this urge

56:25.160 --> 56:27.160
that I should just like keep trucking

56:27.160 --> 56:30.000
and keep on pushing through no matter what,

56:30.000 --> 56:34.800
but it did feel like admitting a frailty to them.

56:34.800 --> 56:36.720
And I don't know, I just wanted to get your thoughts

56:36.720 --> 56:39.280
on that sort of broader idea.

56:39.280 --> 56:40.160
This thing that I wrote,

56:40.160 --> 56:42.520
it's exactly about all those questions like that.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.000
And I'm with you.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.840
Oh, so you're saying I gotta get the black guy.

56:45.840 --> 56:46.680
You gotta pay for it.

56:46.680 --> 56:49.120
He's gotta get his nut milk away.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.360
I gotta get his nut.

56:50.360 --> 56:52.000
Plug, plug, plug.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.560
No, but I'm with you and it's exactly,

56:53.560 --> 56:55.800
just I sit there and I have all those instincts too

56:55.800 --> 56:58.080
of like, I better put the poker face on

56:58.080 --> 57:00.760
and I better make them think everything's okay

57:00.760 --> 57:02.720
and I gotta be strong for my son.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.480
And my dad did all those things for me

57:04.480 --> 57:05.840
and he's a great dad.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.820
But then I also think about how many years

57:07.820 --> 57:12.820
I've unwrapped so much of those exact things in therapy

57:12.940 --> 57:17.500
and how that mentality of feeling like you need to be tough

57:17.500 --> 57:20.880
in the face of stuff and how you shouldn't show emotion,

57:20.880 --> 57:23.480
like how much that built to boiling points for me.

57:23.480 --> 57:25.860
And I go, oh, this is all stuff that instinctively

57:25.860 --> 57:26.920
I'm feeling like I have to do

57:26.920 --> 57:28.680
because that's the only example I know.

57:28.680 --> 57:30.840
Maybe some of it's example, some of it's biological.

57:30.840 --> 57:33.920
I don't know, but it didn't work out well for me.

57:33.920 --> 57:38.440
All those traditional, like, I wish that maybe at,

57:38.440 --> 57:40.800
I'm not the only person of my age

57:40.800 --> 57:42.320
who probably wishes my dad could have been

57:42.320 --> 57:43.920
a little more emotional,

57:43.920 --> 57:46.820
who could have let his guard down at times

57:46.820 --> 57:49.020
and maybe that would have let me let my guard down.

57:49.020 --> 57:52.520
And I sit here and I'm like, man, I am a mess.

57:53.880 --> 57:54.720
I'm an actual mess.

57:54.720 --> 57:58.120
I had an incident, we moved to our house in Jersey

57:58.120 --> 58:00.620
and I write about this in the thing that I'm plugging,

58:00.620 --> 58:05.620
but I started to have like an attack.

58:05.720 --> 58:07.120
Like I've had these panic attacks,

58:07.120 --> 58:08.640
these anxiety attacks over the years.

58:08.640 --> 58:12.000
And I realized I hadn't looked up the mental hospital

58:12.000 --> 58:15.160
closest to me at my new house.

58:15.160 --> 58:16.960
So I looked it up just in case I had to go.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.560
And it was one that we used to,

58:18.560 --> 58:19.840
when we were growing up in Jersey,

58:19.840 --> 58:21.720
one big thing that people like to do for fun

58:21.720 --> 58:24.840
is they go and they break into abandoned mental hospitals.

58:24.840 --> 58:26.560
Yeah, it's really fun.

58:26.560 --> 58:30.040
And I was like, oh, it's Greystone Hospital.

58:30.040 --> 58:32.200
I've broken into the abandoned parts of that.

58:32.200 --> 58:33.160
Am I really gonna go be,

58:33.160 --> 58:34.960
is that the full circle moment of my life?

58:34.960 --> 58:36.400
Like when I was 16,

58:36.400 --> 58:38.840
I used to break into this mental hospital for fun

58:38.840 --> 58:40.520
and now I'm gonna go be a patient there.

58:40.520 --> 58:43.280
And I'm in my yard holding my son.

58:43.280 --> 58:45.480
It's the circle of life.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.940
That's the real circle of life.

58:46.940 --> 58:49.720
And I'm like Googling that with my phone in one hand

58:49.720 --> 58:52.760
while holding my son in the other and crying.

58:52.760 --> 58:57.360
And I'm just like, oh, I am bad at being a dad

58:57.360 --> 58:59.160
in the traditional sense.

58:59.160 --> 59:02.380
So how do I do this?

59:02.380 --> 59:05.160
And when I went to look for advice on it,

59:05.160 --> 59:06.080
there wasn't much out there.

59:06.080 --> 59:08.360
So I just wrote a thing that is funny.

59:08.360 --> 59:09.760
I'm not qualified to give advice,

59:09.760 --> 59:12.360
but it's like a funny look at stuff like this.

59:12.360 --> 59:13.200
It's never stopped us.

59:13.200 --> 59:15.360
Yeah, we've been doing it for 13 years.

59:15.360 --> 59:16.200
There you go.

59:16.200 --> 59:17.840
Yeah, you build up, right?

59:17.840 --> 59:19.320
You just start getting honest.

59:19.320 --> 59:20.760
You just gotta start getting honest.

59:20.760 --> 59:23.000
You can also, Justin, you can just do what I do,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.760
which is I'm very open about my emotions

59:25.760 --> 59:27.040
and my mental health and my kids,

59:27.040 --> 59:29.560
but then I also tell them stories

59:29.560 --> 59:30.800
about different wild animals

59:30.800 --> 59:32.360
that I've been in fist fight with

59:32.360 --> 59:34.520
and how much I've embarrassed those animals

59:34.520 --> 59:37.200
and be like, yeah, there's one time three bears came in

59:37.200 --> 59:38.480
and I whooped their asses.

59:38.480 --> 59:39.380
I do that too.

59:39.380 --> 59:40.880
I'm like, yeah, I know I'm crying

59:40.880 --> 59:43.400
about this McDonald's commercial I saw

59:43.400 --> 59:44.760
and I don't seem to be very okay,

59:44.760 --> 59:46.800
but I built that table you're eating on, kid.

59:46.800 --> 59:47.720
Yeah, right, right, right.

59:47.720 --> 59:51.320
Oh yeah, I just watched 30 seconds of Homeward Bound

59:51.320 --> 59:52.800
and yeah, now I'm sobbing,

59:52.800 --> 59:54.920
but also watch me pick up this heavy chair.

59:54.920 --> 59:57.080
I can't listen to Sola Salute from Seussical,

59:57.080 --> 59:58.280
so what, kid?

59:58.280 --> 59:59.120
Get off my case.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.440
Well, I got a punch to the drywall.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.760
I got 50 cigars.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.120
Hey, you're going on the road again.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:05.960
Yeah.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.040
That's gotta feel, gotta be exciting.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:08.880
Oh, it's the best.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.720
I had started going on the road last year

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.080
and then the Omicron shut it down.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.920
Oh yeah.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.760
Pushed it back five months.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.580
Oh yeah, baby.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.420
Yeah, baby.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.560
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.200
I got it all scheduled starting in May.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.780
People can go to ChrisGeth.com

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.840
and I got, I mean, dates all over the country

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.840
of Florida and California and Portland and Seattle

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.480
and guess where else?

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.880
West Virginia.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.720
That's right.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.540
For the first time.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.380
Come to Morgantown.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.200
For the first time.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.040
Have you never been to West Virginia

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.880
or have you never performed?

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.560
I've driven through West Virginia

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.620
and in my past life, I used to work at a book series

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.780
all about haunted places and conspiracy theories and stuff,

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.160
so I've driven around West Virginia

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.000
in relation to that.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.280
I went to the Trans-Allegheny Asylum there.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.480
There's a huge abandoned mental hospital

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.800
that they turned into a haunted house.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.640
Tasteful.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.480
Love that.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.920
Love it.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.760
Yes.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.880
Yeah, we did, when we had all our tours planned out

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.160
for 2020 and I can remember very clearly

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.220
having this discussion of like,

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.060
well, we had to cancel the March shows,

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.720
but I bet this will be all set by April.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:16.880
And I was right,

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.240
it turned out to be April 2022.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.080
Yeah.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.920
Oh, so you guys got your tour dates back up?

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.760
Oh, yeah.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.580
Yeah.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.420
Good, good.

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.480
I wanted to name the tour something

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.640
like the God Willing and the Creep Don't Rise tour

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.880
or the Tempest.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.880
This time for sure.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.180
Yeah, the Pending to, the Hubris of Man tour.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.420
That's at KrisGeth.com.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.660
Scribd is where you can find

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.360
Kris' new, not a book, I know.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.800
It's like a novella, but it's a novella.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.400
It's called Dad on Pills.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.220
You'll like it.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.060
Dad on Pills.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.760
And well, Kris, I appreciate you being here, bud.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.600
Thank you.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.420
Oh, thanks for having me.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.240
And we didn't even talk any smack about J.D. Amato,

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.080
which we could have done.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:01.920
Oh, we will.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.240
Oh, that fucking clown.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.720
Join us for the NBNB AM after show.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.660
Yeah.

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:09.940
Uh-huh.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.640
Thank you, that was so fun.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.960
Thank you so much.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.800
Thank you.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.600
That was, no, that was for Kris Gethard.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.720
That wasn't for you.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.540
Damn it.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.380
How dare you?

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.400
Don't try to steal one of Justin's precious thankses.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.460
Well, I was just so excited.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.360
You know, like on Great British Bake Off,

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.640
when Paul Hollywood goes in for the handshake

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.360
and another contestant will swoop in

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.280
and take the handshake and then Paul's like,

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.120
damn it.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.480
Yeah, I touched you.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.160
Sorry, I was gonna shake your hand,

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.440
but then Tom Rick came over and took it.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.480
Tom Rick is the name of every contestant on the show.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.240
Anyway, thank you, Kris Gethard,

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.600
and thank you to you for listening.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.640
And I guess thank you to Travis.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.480
Yes.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.300
Yes.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.140
I don't need your thanks.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:47.980
Yes.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.800
I don't need it.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.640
Fucking got it.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.800
Travis, do the promotions.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.640
You're good at that.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.480
Oh, right, right, right.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.600
So we're really excited.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.360
We're going back on the road.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.800
20 Rendezvous Fancy Takes Flight Tour.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.840
Tickets are on sale now.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.960
We have stops in Washington, DC,

St. Louis, Missouri, Kansas City, Missouri,

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.160
Minneapolis, Minnesota, Boston, Massachusetts.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.440
You don't have to say the states.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.200
Oh, Mashantucket.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.680
Salt Lake City, Portland, San Diego,

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.320
and a version of the Mashantucket area.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.160
People aren't going to be like,

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.280
oh, you mean San Diego, North Carolina?

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.120
You know?

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:23.940
Well, I know, but I was trying to get,

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.160
I was trying to pump it up, you know,

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.280
because sometimes people just like hearing

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.820
the name of their state, you know what I mean?

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:28.660
Yeah.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.640
That's how I feel when I hear Ohio.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.760
So virtual Taz in May.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.760

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.200
I mean, we're doing as many as we can.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.880

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.720

thank you to everybody who joined us

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.200
for the virtual show on Saturday.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.040
That hasn't happened yet.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.160
No, but it will once people listen to this.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.000
We haven't done it yet.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.040
How do you know if anybody joined?

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:13.880
Maybe nobody joined.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.140
Well, at least dad will be there.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.920

Maybe you'll be the first to see it.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.420

Hey, thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song,

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.120
My Life Is Better With You.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.160

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.120
Possible.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:32.940
Impossible.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.780
Nobody's that cool.

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.760
It's possible she is that cool.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.160
And yeah, thank you.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.740
Thank you, Montaigne.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.760
And that's it.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.680
We don't have a final Yahoo ever again,

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.920
but instead let's just-

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.760
Will you do-

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.580
Short prayer?

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.560
The thing is you're doing a new bit.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.400
Yeah, maybe.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.280
Oh, Griffin, maybe this is your final point

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.520

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.020
This is your don't forget to wear sunscreen

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:57.860
or something like that.

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.720
You do know that I am doing that in a couple of places.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.960
Oh, then this is great practice.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.800
We haven't talked.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.300
Listen, Griffin, we don't have time

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:08.400
to get into that because it will be a thorough conversation

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.240
when we do address that topic.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.780
Well, then I will say that go out there

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:20.120
and just fucking go ahead and just go out.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.360
Sorry, it's go out there.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.200
Go ahead.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.240
Tonight-

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.240
That sounds like you're holding the door open

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.400
for the graduating class.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.860
Tonight, make the most of it.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:31.840
And go out there.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.660
Go out there.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.500
Go ahead.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.680
Good shit, Applebee's.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.800
Why didn't Justin-

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.640
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.760
This has been my brother,

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.840
my brother may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:07:07.840
It's better with you.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:14.840
My life is better with you.
