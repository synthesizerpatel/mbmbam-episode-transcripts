00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.960
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.960 --> 00:54.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm Travis, what's even the point?

00:54.640 --> 00:58.480
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. I'm just

00:58.480 --> 01:02.640
gonna stick with it. Travis, what's wrong? We seem to have joined Travis in media res.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.160
I missed it. Let's take a step back and see what happened. I missed it.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.120
What? I missed it. Which one? Which did you miss of them?

01:09.840 --> 01:14.000
I missed 420. Oh, shoot. Oh, Trav.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.040
I know. I know. What were you doing?

01:17.040 --> 01:22.400
I wasn't paying attention. I was just, Griffin, nothing. That's the thing.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.640
Oh, shoot. I just didn't, you know?

01:26.640 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, so you got up and you were just going about your day,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.960
and you did smoke a little bit of weed, like one or two joints.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.840
But just normal, just the normal amount. The normal amount, not like the buck wild

01:37.840 --> 01:42.640
amount that you're supposed to do on a funny weed day. Trav, I'm so sorry, buddy.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.840
Well, you know, it's one of the things, it happens when you work from home

01:45.840 --> 01:52.320
and you don't own a calendar and like, you just, you know, all the days start to run together.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.120
Like, I forgot it was April for a while. You know what I mean? So like,

01:55.680 --> 02:00.800
and it wasn't until, you know, on the 21st, all my friends, all my weed friends were like,

02:00.800 --> 02:04.000
so what did you get up to yesterday? And I was like, yeah, I just sort of

02:04.000 --> 02:07.840
smoked a normal amount of weed and went on about my day. And they were like, what?

02:08.560 --> 02:12.480
And then, so not only did I miss it, I was also embarrassed in all the forums.

02:12.480 --> 02:19.760
It's such an inspiration to me that 420 is able to, you know, usually people would start to think

02:19.760 --> 02:25.920
it passe. They would start to think that scene is over. It's played. 420, we get it. Everybody

02:25.920 --> 02:32.720
hysterical. But 420, it's just so good and right to have a day about weed that everybody's just

02:32.720 --> 02:37.360
like, let's not ruin this for ourselves. Like, let's just all try to be cool about the fact

02:37.360 --> 02:40.080
that this is a day about weed and like, celebrate that.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.400
If you want to come for my 420, you better be prepared for me to come for your Halloween.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.320
It's like, what if today it's just all pumpkins and candy and costumes? Like, why?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.120
Why? Why today that?

02:51.120 --> 02:56.880
It's just like the way that people have embraced June 9th or like March 11th is like-

02:56.880 --> 03:01.360
Well, March 11th is National 311 Day where we all get together. And we also, I will say,

03:01.360 --> 03:04.640
smoke a considerable amount of weed and listen to 311 together.

03:04.640 --> 03:09.760
True. And which is funny because on 420, I usually listen to 311 and smoke

03:09.760 --> 03:11.200
an inordinate amount of weed.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.840
They're interchangeable, really, those two dates.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.520
But then there's June 9th, which I think is special for everyone, obviously. Nice.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.080
Nice.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.400
You idiot. You know, the-

03:25.040 --> 03:30.400
Dumb. I think I'm going to start becoming a Halloween hipster in the same way that some

03:30.400 --> 03:35.600
people are hipsters about 420. I think- I just say like, you know, I wore costumes every day

03:35.600 --> 03:38.640
last week. I don't need a special day for it. You know, that kind of thing.

03:38.640 --> 03:44.000
You're being childish with your jokes about pumpkins and candy and sweets and costumes.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.680
I'm being childish. Fuck off. Life is so fucking hard. Can you not give me these little checkpoints

03:49.680 --> 03:52.800
where I can have just like a little unnecessary celebration?

03:52.800 --> 03:57.440
Some people need to wear costumes to help with chronic pain. Like, yeah, I get it.

03:57.440 --> 04:04.960
I just- I just- I don't like people who are down on holidays for any reason. It's just the year

04:04.960 --> 04:12.880
is just long stretches of bullshit garbage, and then we get one day where we can log on to Twitter

04:12.880 --> 04:17.360
and say that we're smoking weed even though we haven't known where to buy weed in 15 years.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.440
Just let us have that. Let me have it. Please. Please let me just make jokes about it.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.920
I haven't weeded in so long, not since I lived in California, where it's everywhere.

04:27.920 --> 04:28.720
Where it's all over.

04:28.720 --> 04:34.960
Well, I can say that's inaccurate, Travis. I can confirm. I may have-

04:34.960 --> 04:37.920
That was not recreational though, Justin. That was professional weeding.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.760
Yeah, we expensed that.

04:40.480 --> 04:45.120
That was expensed weed. Boy.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.240
How did you spend the fourth 20, Justin?

04:49.680 --> 04:57.280
Well, I was doing interstate travel, which yes, did make things a little more challenging

04:57.280 --> 05:06.720
for sure, but I just sort of drew a lot of pot leaves on my binders, my various binders.

05:07.520 --> 05:14.240
I drew pot leaves and white out on those. Took a couple coats, but I got a look that I'm very

05:14.240 --> 05:20.320
proud of, and then I drew a guy with a big hat and a funny coat kind of giving a thumbs up.

05:20.320 --> 05:27.040
And he was like, yeah, it was cool too. And he was kind of like having some weed.

05:27.040 --> 05:35.200
You could tell he was about to or knew where or had been with weed in that way.

05:36.400 --> 05:43.600
I spent it by unloading about 18 ounces, made about 40 Gs.

05:43.600 --> 05:51.200
So I think you probably took it a little far.

05:52.400 --> 05:58.640
I'm like fucking Walgreens, you know? I come for that Valentine's Day candy momentum.

05:59.680 --> 06:05.280
The best time to buy pot at Walgreens is April 21st. A lot of people forget this,

06:05.280 --> 06:09.440
but if you go there on April 21st, they are giving the stuff away.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.640
I mean, basically. Listen, but if you don't get there till like 3pm,

06:12.640 --> 06:15.120
it's all just gonna be like white marijuana, you know what I mean?

06:15.120 --> 06:20.400
The gross kind that nobody wants, you know? Those crunchy Nermal flakes.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.320
Exactly. No, thank you.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.640
Should we advise? Yeah, this is an advice show, ostensibly.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.360
So we take your questions, turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

06:33.360 --> 06:40.480
This first one is, well, I don't know who it's from. It's a very short question.

06:40.480 --> 06:45.360
I'm going to play paintball for the first time. Advice? Strategies?

06:46.480 --> 06:48.960
That's from somebody. I don't know. That question made me really,

06:48.960 --> 06:54.880
really happy because it's been a long time since we got this really straightforward to the point.

06:55.920 --> 06:59.280
I just want to say, side note, hi, everybody. This is Travis McElroy,

06:59.280 --> 07:01.200
who goes through all the questions every week.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.840
Please stop ending your questions with, am I good?

07:04.480 --> 07:06.640
It's like all of them, huh? Please stop.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.000
It's like 75% of questions end with, am I good?

07:10.000 --> 07:14.400
And am I good is not an actionable, advisable position.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.040
That's not a good question. In the retail industry,

07:17.040 --> 07:21.520
we call that a closed question. We need an open-ended question here.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.600
Thank you. That's what I like about this.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.320
Like for instance, this essentially Yahoo answer question,

07:26.320 --> 07:28.400
can you give me advice and strategies for paintball?

07:28.400 --> 07:31.520
I will say this. The last time I played paintball was at a buddy's bachelor party,

07:31.520 --> 07:35.520
and it was about 48 degrees outside.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.880
I ran around and scampered and did my fucking Sam Fisher techniques all over that battlefield,

07:40.880 --> 07:44.880
and I breathed in so much of that cold Texas air that I got extremely sick for the wedding

07:44.880 --> 07:50.880
the next day. Just watch that. I'm not saying you're going to a wedding tomorrow,

07:50.880 --> 07:54.480
but just don't. This is very much the same as my laser tag advice.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.560
Do not overexert yourself in all things.

07:56.560 --> 08:01.200
I want to congratulate this person because they have obviously come to the right place.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.880
They've come to My Brother, My Brother, Me, a tactical podcast,

08:05.440 --> 08:10.720
and I think that that shows a lot that your head's already where it needs to be,

08:10.720 --> 08:13.440
turning to the right people to support you.

08:13.440 --> 08:18.400
If you have even a modicum of strategy with paintball,

08:18.400 --> 08:22.800
everybody else is just afraid to get shot. You have to live without that fear.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.720
You have to get beyond that fear and be more sort of a symbol.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.800
That's the thing that people forget with paintball,

08:31.360 --> 08:34.800
is that everybody's running around Sam Fisher style,

08:34.800 --> 08:40.000
and what you lack in that way is nobody to stand up and say,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.480
I am your god now. Die for me. I'm the reaper.

08:45.520 --> 08:51.920
Get in line, follow behind me, and I will lead you to victory or Valhalla

08:51.920 --> 08:56.080
or whatever sort of promises you want to make of glory and death.

08:56.080 --> 09:01.440
And that's the thing that people forget to do is become a symbol that people can believe in.

09:01.440 --> 09:06.240
Also, just as an aesthetic, wear clothes that are already spattered in paint,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.480
and then it's hard to tell if they hit you.

09:09.120 --> 09:09.680
That's good.

09:10.720 --> 09:17.280
Or just wear the mask and as little protective clothing as you want that says,

09:17.280 --> 09:22.720
I'm not, I'm not scared. I'm not scared of the painful welts that I will develop

09:22.720 --> 09:25.200
from your balls of paint. Come at me.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.560
I'm looking at a list of terminology here on Wikipedia

09:28.560 --> 09:31.440
because I thought it would be funnier than it actually is.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.240
There is an entry on here that says,

09:35.200 --> 09:39.840
streetball, paintball played by those who do it simply for the love of the sport.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.200
Yes.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.280
Aren't you just, you're describing, yeah, you're describing 99.999.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.000
There's like one person out there who is a professional paintballer,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.920
and I'm sure those people exist who are just like,

09:49.920 --> 09:52.480
oh fuck, another day of paintball.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.160
Pretty much everybody else is out there like,

09:56.960 --> 09:57.360
great.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.120
You know what?

09:59.120 --> 10:06.480
People don't do enough like covert, like Black Ops paintball maneuvers.

10:06.480 --> 10:11.120
Like bring your own armbands so you can switch teams at will.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.800
You know what I mean?

10:12.800 --> 10:16.800
This both works as espionage, but also if your team is losing,

10:16.800 --> 10:18.720
well now you're on the red team and you're winning.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.560
Just like that. You know what I mean?

10:20.560 --> 10:24.320
Or like maybe go hide in the woods until the whole match is over

10:24.320 --> 10:25.600
so you don't get shot.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.680
Oh yeah, that fucking Hacksaw Ridge shit.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.840
Yeah, and then you come out and you're like,

10:29.840 --> 10:32.800
actually the last person standing was on the blue team.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.080
And you like take out the last red team member.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.440
No, that's not how Hacksaw did it.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.600
Now I did just watch Hacksaw Ridge over the shoulder

10:41.600 --> 10:43.760
of somebody sitting in front of me on the airplane.

10:43.760 --> 10:44.880
And so I feel pretty...

10:45.600 --> 10:47.360
That movie is, by the way, as far as I can tell,

10:47.360 --> 10:51.280
is a two hour long cut of that one scene in Saving Private Ryan

10:51.280 --> 10:54.160
where all the people get horribly injured on the beach.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.520
It's just like, I think that was Clint Eastwood made that one.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.200
And he was like, I really liked that scene.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.280
People walk around, legs blowed up.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.720
That was Mel Gibson.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.160
Oh, it was Mel doing that one.

11:04.160 --> 11:08.800
Well, that makes a lot more sense now because he likes that saw shit.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.640
But it's just like, man, I like that part of the movie.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.840
I'd love for it to be two hours.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.200
Just a lot of people wandering around horribly, horribly injured.

11:15.200 --> 11:15.600
I love it.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.240
You know what, Griffin?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.040
I agree.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.320
Why all these war movies always have to show people getting hurt?

11:20.320 --> 11:21.200
You know what I mean?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.040
Where's the fun side?

11:23.040 --> 11:23.840
It's excessive, it's excessive.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.280
Where's the card games?

11:25.280 --> 11:25.760
Every four minutes-

11:25.760 --> 11:27.200
The Blackadder stuff.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.680
Every four minutes somebody jumps on a fucking grenade in that movie.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.720
It's like they had this new like gut launching technology

11:32.720 --> 11:34.800
that they were like really fucking psyched to use.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.480
The problem with paintball is that

11:38.480 --> 11:40.960
that no matter how tactically you get,

11:41.680 --> 11:45.920
if you pull some sneaky shit and some cool shit and blast a bunch of people,

11:45.920 --> 11:49.760
the problem with paintball is they are immediately able to comment

11:49.760 --> 11:51.040
on what you have done for them.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.600
You know, in war, when you kill people in war,

11:53.600 --> 11:56.240
I bet you probably feel guilty later.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.280
But like in the immediate, you don't get people like,

11:59.280 --> 12:01.200
oh man, come on.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.160
Why did you do that?

12:02.160 --> 12:03.280
Come on, man.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.280
That's not cool.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.160
We were all facing the other way and you came up behind the thing.

12:08.160 --> 12:08.880
Oh man, come on.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.280
It was Todd's birthday and you shot him.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.680
You shot Todd on his birthday.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.800
This was for him.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.480
You ran me through with a bayonet off, man.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.120
Come on.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.000
Come on, man.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.360
You got me with the bayonet.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.640
We were all marching forward in straight lines in our bright red coats

12:24.640 --> 12:27.920
and you guys were just like hiding in the trees in the bushes and shit.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.200
Oh man.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.080
Man, you burned all our Johnny Cakes.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.680
Come on, what a turd.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.320
You shot my butt, dude.

12:37.760 --> 12:38.720
Look at that turd.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.560
Those turds are using paint cannons and shooting a bunch of people at once.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.040
Come on.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.320
These blankets are just soaked in paint.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.960
You just put paint all over the blankets.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.320
Come on.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.280
Come on.

12:53.280 --> 12:53.840
I don't-

12:53.840 --> 12:55.200
You're not supposed to go in the river.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.080
Come on, that's off limits.

12:58.080 --> 12:58.880
They told us.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.440
Do y'all want to know who?

13:01.440 --> 13:05.120
Who? How come Civil War reenactors don't use fucking paintball guns?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.760
Wouldn't that be the sweetest?

13:07.760 --> 13:12.160
Wouldn't that elevate Civil War reenactment if they were just like pop, pop, pop?

13:12.160 --> 13:14.960
Like I know that you're feeling a little bit of that pain.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.080
Like you want to get in it?

13:16.080 --> 13:16.480
Get in it.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.120
You want to get in it.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.640
Yeah, you want to be in George Washington's fucking mindset?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.280
Civil War hero George Washington.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.640
You want to be in that mindset?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.760
Okay, but there will be a cost, a pain cost.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.760
It's going to sting you and zing you.

13:29.760 --> 13:36.480
Have I told you guys my idea for a maybe billion dollar idea for war reenactments?

13:36.480 --> 13:37.920
Oh, I thought you were just going to say war.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.480
I'd be like no.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.280
No, it's a gun.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.560
It's two guns attached front to back.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.160
I call them pre-enactments.

13:46.880 --> 13:51.600
And it's like future wars that you're staging and how you think they would go.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.440
And it could go so far as to like, you know, the year 3017.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.000
You know what I mean?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.640
And it's like this is what I think war will be like in the future.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.840
But the nice thing about pre-enactments is they can end however you want.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.080
Oh, sure.

14:04.080 --> 14:10.720
You don't have to feel like, just because maybe the, you know, the Union one,

14:11.440 --> 14:13.360
that doesn't hold up in pre-enactments.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.160
You could do whatever you want and it could be different every time.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.720
Technically every time that two nerds are flying their drones close to each other

14:20.720 --> 14:22.880
and then they crash into each other and fall to the ground,

14:22.880 --> 14:27.520
that's technically a pre-enactment of the 3017 drone battles.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.760
And it's also copyright infringement.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.120
TMTMTO.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.360
TMTM, drone battle, war reenactment.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.160
And I think, Trav, we could do a pretty good job

14:36.160 --> 14:40.720
accurately pre-enacting the next war with today's political stuff.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.040
I don't follow what's going on.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.320
Is there something going on?

14:44.320 --> 14:44.800
A lot of it.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.640
So here's another question.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.440
It's a Yahoo question.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.400
It's a Yahoo question.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.320
I wanted to celebrate Science March,

14:52.320 --> 14:56.880
which, Justin, you and Sydney and Chuck participated in.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.840
Yes, is Science March, like, 420?

14:59.840 --> 15:02.800
It was 422, actually.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.300
Okay.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.600
After sort of that good head buzz that worn off,

15:07.600 --> 15:09.840
it's like, let's get out there and win one for science.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.320
This one was sent in by Casey Mayer.

15:13.040 --> 15:13.680
Thank you, Casey.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.680
It's Yahoo Answers user question mark, who asks,

15:15.680 --> 15:22.320
if all the birds in the world held on to a tree and fly up,

15:23.040 --> 15:24.240
will the world move?

15:25.120 --> 15:25.520
Science.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.400
Damn.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.120
Damn, dude.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.880
This one would work for 420 or Science Day.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.760
If all the birds in the world-

15:33.760 --> 15:36.560
Grab one, it would have to be a big old tree.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.600
Big, big, big tree.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.320
Deep roots, right?

15:38.320 --> 15:39.520
Not to yank them out of the ground.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.440
Deep, deep, deep roots.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.400
Here's the thing.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.280
Here's the thing.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.920
I'm talking about a Yggdrasil situation.

15:45.920 --> 15:51.440
I know the answer to this, I think, maybe.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.160
But we often run into this.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.320
I feel this urge to point out actual logical answers to this

15:58.320 --> 16:00.960
because I know that there will be people on Twitter

16:00.960 --> 16:02.560
after the episode goes up and says like,

16:02.560 --> 16:04.800
I can't believe you guys didn't say blank.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.560
But blank is really funny.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.000
And everybody listening at home,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.160
I know there are birds who eat other types of birds.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.560
And so this sort of bird union would never happen.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.560
I get it, but play with us.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.560
Just have some fun.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.840
Just play with me.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.480
Like birds on birds on birds.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.800
Like a bird that stands on another bird's shoulder.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.720
Just because I don't know how big a tree you could find

16:24.720 --> 16:26.320
that would have enough branch space.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.680
But if the birds all kind of locked together, Voltron S-

16:29.680 --> 16:30.880
Eagle holds the branch.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.560
Hawk holds the eagle.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.560
Fucking pigeon holds the hawk.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.920
Sparrow holds the pigeon.

16:36.480 --> 16:36.980
Yes.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.020
Yes.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.320
And then now we're talking about eight wings.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.360
That's a lot of torque.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.960
That's a lot of lift.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.460
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.440
Is there any actual answers?

16:45.440 --> 16:47.520
Did anybody try to like be smart about it?

16:47.520 --> 16:50.000
I mean, there's a lot of you'll rip the tree out of the ground

16:50.000 --> 16:51.760
before it will apply for some-

16:51.760 --> 16:52.260
Boo.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.000
Boo.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.640
Play with us.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.200
Play with me.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.160
Play with us.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.200
If the birds were holding on to trees all over the world,

16:59.200 --> 17:00.640
they'd be going against each other.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.520
Yeah, no shit.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.080
That was never even part of the fucking equation.

17:04.080 --> 17:04.960
One tree.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.160
One big Yggdrasil.

17:06.160 --> 17:11.200
Yahoo Answers user Pranit says, an exciting question.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.000
I agree.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.480
An intriguing conundrum.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.800
I think it can happen.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.440
This could follow Newton's first law of motion,

17:21.440 --> 17:24.000
which I think states that if a bunch of birds hold onto one tree,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.280
they can fly the world away.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.200
You know, there's a lot of people,

17:29.200 --> 17:31.360
there's probably a lot of naysayers about that,

17:31.360 --> 17:35.280
but there is a chance that after the Allfather,

17:35.280 --> 17:36.880
creator of the Allspark,

17:36.880 --> 17:41.440
finished creating the Earth and Cybertron simultaneously,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.600
after the Allfather finished his work,

17:43.600 --> 17:45.520
he was going over, he's like, everything looks good.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.400
Everything looks good.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.320
And then one of the Allangels came to him and said,

17:50.880 --> 17:53.600
Allfather, what is-

17:53.600 --> 17:55.680
And he's like, oh shit.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.480
Oh God, damn it.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.040
Yo, Allfather, you made a lot of birds.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.560
Did you stop to think that maybe-

18:02.560 --> 18:05.600
Shoot, there's a lot of them, huh?

18:05.600 --> 18:07.680
I'll talk to one of the birds

18:07.680 --> 18:10.080
to make sure at least one doesn't show up.

18:10.080 --> 18:14.880
So I'll make Jerry the bird promise that he won't go.

18:14.880 --> 18:15.440
It'll be fine.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.440
I like to think that if these birds do accomplish this feat

18:19.440 --> 18:24.320
and then Earth is tossed into a state of orbital decay

18:24.320 --> 18:28.160
that leads to our agonizing march into the sun's molten core,

18:28.160 --> 18:33.600
we really can't be too pissed off about that, right?

18:33.600 --> 18:38.400
Because it's like, no human's ever done anything

18:38.400 --> 18:39.200
that cool, birds.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.640
Literally all of you came together

18:40.640 --> 18:42.160
to hurl our planet into the sun.

18:42.160 --> 18:45.200
This is coming back to the war on birds though.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.840
That human bird war that we've been touching on

18:47.840 --> 18:48.880
from time to time,

18:48.880 --> 18:53.280
this is like the ultimate power play of the birds.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.240
If we can't have this Earth, then let it be dust.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.960
If we can't have this planet, no one can.

18:59.600 --> 19:05.600
Then let the big burning star in the sky have it.

19:05.600 --> 19:12.560
I just so badly want to see the meeting of each leader

19:12.560 --> 19:15.840
of every kind of bird all getting together

19:15.840 --> 19:17.120
to vote on whether or not

19:17.120 --> 19:20.320
they should all hurl the Earth into the sun

19:20.320 --> 19:22.160
and there's something about that image

19:22.160 --> 19:24.000
that just makes me so happy.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.480
Just to see the hawks and the turkeys and,

19:28.480 --> 19:29.840
well, turkeys don't fly.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.360
Would a turkey, wait, hold on.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.000
Oh shit, shit, flightless birds.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.600
Yes, flightless birds are going to,

19:35.600 --> 19:38.240
especially, can I hit you with our main ally in this quest?

19:38.240 --> 19:41.680
The Judas Iscariot for all bird kind is, of course, penguins.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.160
Penguins, yes.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.040
Sorry, you want to throw it into the sun?

19:45.040 --> 19:47.040
That's the opposite temperature we like.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.480
I like the chilies.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.680
So you're saying that while all the flying birds

19:51.680 --> 19:53.120
are tugging on this tree,

19:53.120 --> 19:55.040
there's going to be a bunch of ostriches down there

19:55.040 --> 19:56.080
like, come on, gosh.

19:56.080 --> 19:56.560
No.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.560
Come on, y'all, come on.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.520
Damn, they'll actually all be laying on their backs

20:01.520 --> 20:02.960
flapping their wings up.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.760
Well, penguins will just be mating nonstop.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.280
They're like, we got to make more penguins

20:07.280 --> 20:08.640
weigh this motherfucker down.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.960
There's a penguin nature special

20:10.960 --> 20:12.240
narrated by David Tennant

20:13.120 --> 20:15.680
and it's called Spies Amongst the Nest or something.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.120
It's called Tuxedo Boys.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.400
It's called Tuxedo Boys

20:18.400 --> 20:20.800
where they've put a bunch of cameras

20:20.800 --> 20:24.240
disguised as penguins in amongst the penguins.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.040
And I bring this up because there are numerous,

20:27.040 --> 20:29.600
numerous times where some penguin

20:29.600 --> 20:31.760
will just try to mate with that camera.

20:31.760 --> 20:32.160
Fuck yeah.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.440
Like penguin, penguins is down.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.160
Penguins are down.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.720
I always say this, all dressed up and somewhere to go,

20:38.720 --> 20:41.120
which is inside of David Tennant's secret camera.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.880
Oh shit, I just realized in my office

20:44.880 --> 20:46.560
that I've been working out of for about three years now,

20:46.560 --> 20:48.960
there's been a completely stationary penguin

20:48.960 --> 20:49.680
this entire time.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.360
And I've never asked any questions about it,

20:51.360 --> 20:52.800
but I'm starting to think David Tennant

20:52.800 --> 20:54.240
is watching me do podcasting.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.360
Well, don't ruin this.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.040
I think I'm going to try to make love to this camera.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.720
The only thing that gives me peace about this scenario

21:02.720 --> 21:05.920
is if you do see the birds trying to pull this shit

21:05.920 --> 21:08.240
and they will eventually, it's fine.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.200
Someday they will.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.800
The good news about it is you just throw

21:10.800 --> 21:12.640
a pack of captain's wafers up there

21:12.640 --> 21:14.880
and they're going to forget the whole enterprise.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.360
No, hold the line.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.560
If you threw one oyster cracker into that moss pit,

21:20.560 --> 21:22.160
they would fucking dissolve.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.200
No problem.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.240
No problem at all.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.760
Here's another question.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.920
A few weeks ago, I had a dream that an actor

21:31.920 --> 21:33.840
who I admire and think is attractive,

21:33.840 --> 21:36.640
Chris Evans, wanted to have sex with me.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.480
The problem is I turned him down,

21:42.480 --> 21:46.400
saying that I was waiting until marriage to Chris Evans.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.000
I have regretted this ever since.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.440
I don't have any sort of significant other

21:49.440 --> 21:51.360
that would have been cheating on my doing

21:51.360 --> 21:53.120
with Chris Evans in my dream.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.120
And if Chris Evans himself actually asked me

21:55.120 --> 21:56.320
if I wanted to do it with him,

21:56.320 --> 21:57.520
I would definitely say yes.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.280
How could I write down his terrible mistake

22:01.280 --> 22:03.760
awkwardly absent in Arkansas?

22:03.760 --> 22:09.760
Okay, I am with this on so many levels

22:09.760 --> 22:11.760
because I feel like once a week,

22:12.960 --> 22:15.200
I have a dream that is like a movie

22:15.200 --> 22:17.280
that is building up to something.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.800
In this case, Your Mind movie was a Chris Evans

22:20.800 --> 22:22.320
amateur pornographic film.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.240
Well, don't say amateur.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.920
You don't know what the quality of this person's pornography is.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.120
I mean, fucking if Chris Evans is in it,

22:27.120 --> 22:28.160
it's definitely high budge.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.200
Okay, that's fair, Travis.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.880
But I have a movie where I find these fucking gloves

22:32.880 --> 22:34.800
that let me fly around and give me super strength,

22:34.800 --> 22:36.960
but the mad inventor of these gloves

22:36.960 --> 22:39.040
needs me to train before he'll let me use them.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.640
And so I go into his secret lair

22:40.640 --> 22:42.240
and I fucking work my ass off

22:42.240 --> 22:44.080
just learning to use these power gloves.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.840
And then the fucking big metal doors open

22:45.840 --> 22:46.880
and I step outside like,

22:46.880 --> 22:48.480
all right, time to fight some.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.680
Hey, Griffin, the baby's crying.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.480
You need to wake up.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.040
And it's like, I just got the power gloves though.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.080
Like once a week, Rachel will wake me up

22:56.080 --> 22:57.920
because it'll be like, hey, can you go get the baby?

22:57.920 --> 23:00.640
And I'll be like, but I just got the hover bike.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.680
I just got the hover bike, just now.

23:05.520 --> 23:08.480
I think the real concern here

23:08.480 --> 23:10.880
that this person question asker didn't even address

23:11.680 --> 23:13.440
is the issue of what if you were dealing

23:13.440 --> 23:15.120
with like concurrent dreaming

23:15.120 --> 23:17.040
and this was not just dream Chris Evans.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.160
Oh my God, Travis.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.040
But like real Chris Evans was also having this dream,

23:21.040 --> 23:22.080
sharing this dream with you.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.880
And then Chris Evans woke up like, no, oh man.

23:26.800 --> 23:27.920
I would have liked to.

23:27.920 --> 23:28.960
I would have done that.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.360
Finally, I'd love to have sex.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.240
I'd love to know what sex feels like on my wiener for once.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.640
It just once, I, Chris Evans.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.360
Sometimes in the movies, they make it pretend like we do,

23:39.360 --> 23:42.000
but I've never actually had the wiener feel of sex before.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.520
I just wanna do sex once where I'm not wearing my trunks

23:45.520 --> 23:46.480
like I have to in the movies.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.920
They make me wear my swim trunks

23:47.920 --> 23:49.920
when I make sex in the movies.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.760
And it's like, I'm always curious

23:51.760 --> 23:53.200
about what if the trunks weren't there?

23:54.400 --> 23:56.400
What would happen if you tried to have sex?

23:57.440 --> 23:59.520
So Chris, it's time.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.760
Are you ready to have sex?

24:02.560 --> 24:04.240
Yeah, let me just get my trunks

24:04.240 --> 24:06.240
and we'll get right to it.

24:06.240 --> 24:10.000
Actually, Chris, you don't have to wear your trunks every time.

24:10.000 --> 24:10.400
What?

24:10.400 --> 24:10.960
Wait, huh?

24:10.960 --> 24:11.760
Huh?

24:11.760 --> 24:12.480
Huh?

24:12.480 --> 24:13.920
I could do it without the trunks.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.520
This is heartbreaking.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.720
I don't, and what's really a bummer is you can't get back

24:20.720 --> 24:22.960
into the Chris Evans sex situation.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.160
You can't get the hover bike.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.720
You can't always get, you can't always conjure up the gloves

24:26.720 --> 24:27.840
because sometimes you lay down like,

24:27.840 --> 24:29.840
all right, I'm gonna step back into my movie

24:29.840 --> 24:32.000
and I'm gonna start with the power gloves.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.880
It's a little cheat code.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.840
And then you close your eyes

24:33.840 --> 24:35.680
and all of a sudden you're having sex with Chris Evans.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.880
You have to master lucid dreaming.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.000
That's it, isn't it?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.240
That's the only thing.

24:42.240 --> 24:46.160
Now, here's a little factoid about the J-Man.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.320
I did kickstart.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.720
I am sort of on the forefront of this.

24:50.720 --> 24:51.680
Oh, man.

24:51.680 --> 24:52.480
I did kickstart a-

24:52.480 --> 24:53.600
This is gonna be so rough.

24:55.360 --> 24:55.840
What?

24:55.840 --> 24:58.160
I'm just like holding onto the arms of my chair

24:58.160 --> 25:00.640
in like preparation for this whack thing

25:00.640 --> 25:02.080
that you've kickstarted.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.400
I'm sort of on the forefront of this.

25:04.400 --> 25:10.160
I did help to kickstart a lucid dreaming helmet

25:10.160 --> 25:12.640
where it's sort of a band that will help you

25:12.640 --> 25:17.040
to gain the ability to have lucid dreams.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.480
It's called the Aurora.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.720
And I'm sort of on the forefront

25:20.720 --> 25:23.280
of this experimental technology.

25:24.480 --> 25:31.040
The one thing about it is that we did sort of get over

25:31.040 --> 25:35.760
that hump in late 2013, and I have not gotten...

25:35.760 --> 25:36.480
Oh, shoot.

25:36.480 --> 25:37.520
I haven't gotten...

25:38.160 --> 25:40.160
I'm assuming it's still in testing

25:40.160 --> 25:41.280
because I have not received my-

25:41.280 --> 25:43.360
You gotta be careful with a product like this.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.280
You don't wanna give somebody spooky dreams

25:45.280 --> 25:47.680
with the wrong head crystals, Justin.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.280
Justin, how do you know that you're not somewhere

25:51.280 --> 25:54.640
asleep wearing it right now dreaming this?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.680
Justin, I'm just a figment of your shit, dude.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.440
This is all a dream, Justin.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.080
You can have sex with Chris Evans, whatever you want.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.040
Turn around.

26:03.040 --> 26:06.720
Sorry, you think you are a successful podcaster?

26:06.720 --> 26:08.000
Oh, God, how fucking rich.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.280
In West Virginia?

26:09.280 --> 26:11.360
In West Virginia, Justin, all of this

26:11.360 --> 26:14.480
is just a weird buffalo wing you ate.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.200
Don't you get it?

26:16.720 --> 26:19.840
One thing is I am reviewing the emails I've received

26:19.840 --> 26:23.200
about the Aurora over time, and the subject line

26:23.200 --> 26:26.800
has now changed from initially it was Aurora,

26:26.800 --> 26:31.680
the ultimate lucid dreaming tool, to the Aurora Dream Band,

26:33.200 --> 26:34.880
the ultimate sleep aid.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.680
So I am worried that maybe somewhere along the line

26:37.680 --> 26:41.280
they realize that lucid dreaming may have been

26:41.280 --> 26:42.720
flying too close to the sun.

26:42.720 --> 26:43.600
It's not just that.

26:43.600 --> 26:48.720
A sleep aid is the opposite of a lucid dreaming tool.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.080
It's a placid dreaming.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.560
It's an extremely placid dreaming tool now.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.800
The next email you guys are just gonna say,

26:54.800 --> 26:57.680
the Aurora headband, it kind of smells like lavender.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.240
You'll like it.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.600
You can use it to cover your eyes.

27:03.280 --> 27:03.920
Aw, dang.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.840
Aw, dang, that does help.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.040
Please no one Google to find out how much that was.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.040
Actually, legally, I'm putting a legal disclaimer on this.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.680
Please, please don't Google that, okay?

27:17.680 --> 27:20.080
I was really into lucid dreaming at the time, all right?

27:20.080 --> 27:20.560
Thank you.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.360
Did you ever pull it?

27:21.360 --> 27:21.520
Thank you.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.400
Did you ever get good at it?

27:22.400 --> 27:24.000
I don't know, Griffin.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I don't have the fucking band yet.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.560
But I think they're gonna fulfill.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.920
I have feel pretty good.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.520
It's been about four years now.

27:31.520 --> 27:35.760
I'm feeling good that we can't be that far away from this tech.

27:35.760 --> 27:39.920
Yeah, $150 for the first early bird backers.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.120
$160 for the later birds.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.200
I would have loved to get on at that level.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.200
$150 early bird sounds pretty sweet.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.520
I probably have it by now.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.720
Probably about $200 is probably what J-Dog spent on this.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.920
And let me look at this thing.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.640
I mean, it looks like a very shitty, very small Oculus Rift.

27:57.680 --> 28:00.960
If you want, Justin, I could just paint the inside of some goggles black

28:00.960 --> 28:02.480
and sell it to you for $120.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.680
I could print out some fucking high res glossy JPEGs of Chris Evans

28:05.680 --> 28:08.080
and just tape them onto some fucking scuba goggles

28:08.080 --> 28:09.280
and put those on your eyes every night.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.000
Pretty good to sleep.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.920
Actually, I could just probably pay Chris Evans

28:13.920 --> 28:15.840
to come hang out with you for a while if you want.

28:15.840 --> 28:16.080
Yeah.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.760
Should we go to the money zone

28:17.760 --> 28:22.800
so you could recoup some of your lost sleep dream band finances?

28:22.800 --> 28:23.520
Yeah, let's head in.

28:34.000 --> 28:34.960
We're inside it now.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.240
We're here.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.120
Hi, money zone.

28:37.120 --> 28:37.520
Hello.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.400
Can I talk about me undies?

28:40.400 --> 28:40.880
Please do.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.680
Here's what's up with me undies.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.640
I want you to take a personal inventory

28:46.640 --> 28:49.280
of your wardrobe right now.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.000
Something missing?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.080
Something missing in your beautiful wardrobe?

28:52.080 --> 28:55.440
I bet these soft modal underwears are missing from your body.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.560
Me undies are the best underwear that you can get.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.160
They deliver them right to your door.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.000
It's made of sustainably sourced micro modal.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.840
It's a fabric three times softer than cotton.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.440
It's literally all I wear now.

29:05.440 --> 29:09.600
I am fortunate enough to have replaced all of my bad garbage underwear.

29:10.880 --> 29:11.360
That's not true.

29:11.360 --> 29:15.840
I have one pair of boxers that I wear just because the whole...

29:15.840 --> 29:17.840
Just to remember the dark times.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.720
Just to remember the dark times.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.320
But sure enough, by the end of the day,

29:20.320 --> 29:24.800
those things are just soaking wet and I don't know why, but not me undies.

29:26.080 --> 29:26.960
Guess what?

29:26.960 --> 29:27.760
Guess what, guys?

29:27.760 --> 29:31.040
You can save time and money each month by getting a monthly subscription to me undies.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.440
They send you the new me undies to your door and they have fun prints

29:35.440 --> 29:37.440
and they're really sexy and cute.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.000
If you don't want a subscription, that's fine.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.840
You can still save because me undies is offering you 20% off your first pair.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.120
You're gonna love it.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.600
I would like to tell you about a box of nature that I received.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.800
They just send you a bunch of pine cones?

30:07.440 --> 30:07.920
Yeah.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.120
Oh God, it's great.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.040
I think we've only made that joke eight times so far.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.400
Are you talking about nature box?

30:12.400 --> 30:15.200
Shut your dick.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.120
Nature box is a long time friend of the show.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.000
Hey, huff my shorts, Travis, if you're gonna be a balls about it.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.240
They make great snacks that actually taste great and are better for you.

30:26.880 --> 30:30.720
Listen, I'm a bit of a snack monster from time to time

30:30.720 --> 30:34.640
and I don't mean like a cute, like Sesame Street, like, oh, me love snacks.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.440
I mean like, my God, my God, what have you done?

30:38.400 --> 30:39.920
Kind of snack monster.

30:39.920 --> 30:44.000
And when nature box came in my life, it presented me a snacking opportunity

30:44.000 --> 30:47.680
that didn't make me feel like shit for the rest of the day.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.800
And I really appreciate that from nature box.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.440
They make snacks that they don't have,

30:54.240 --> 30:57.280
they're high quality ingredients that are free from artificial colors,

30:57.280 --> 30:58.880
flavors or sweeteners.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.440
So you don't have to feel bad about snacking.

31:01.440 --> 31:05.200
And they have lots of different options, sweet, savory, spicy,

31:05.200 --> 31:09.280
lots of different things for any snack preference you got.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.760
And they've made their service even better.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.560
Now you can order as much as you want as often as you want

31:14.560 --> 31:18.080
with no minimum purchase required and you can cancel any time.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.880
So right now you'll save even more

31:20.880 --> 31:24.960
because nature box is offering our fans 50% off your first order

31:42.400 --> 31:44.240
It plays country music when you open it.

31:44.240 --> 31:48.800
Plays country music that may or may not be DJed by our dad

31:48.800 --> 31:50.240
depending on when you open it.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.680
Our dad's a country music DJ.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.040
Yeah, I think folks get it at this point.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.720
Okay, because if they don't know that,

31:56.720 --> 32:00.240
what I have just said is even weirder than it is on the surface.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.200
It is on the surface.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.280
I've got a personal message here.

32:05.280 --> 32:08.560
It's for Charlie, Nicole, Justin, and Brittany, and it's from Nelson.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.400
And there's an exclamation point.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.080
So that was the exact right reading.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.640
Thanks for introducing me to these good, good brothers.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.040
Our annual NOLA trip was a blast.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.960
Can't wait to do it again next year.

32:18.960 --> 32:19.760
Thank you, brothers.

32:20.720 --> 32:21.520
Well, you're very welcome.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.240
You're very welcome.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.360
Where was my invite?

32:23.360 --> 32:26.240
I would love to get down to NOLA and chill with y'all.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.240
Do you think you're the Justin in this message?

32:28.240 --> 32:31.120
I did not go to NOLA.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.240
I have not been to NOLA.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.920
Oh, y'all, we got to get to NOLA.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.240
We got to get to NOLA.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.800
Hey, what would a NOLA show be like for us?

32:38.800 --> 32:40.160
We should do a NOLA show.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.400
We should definitely go and do a NOLA show, huh?

32:44.240 --> 32:45.520
You know where else I want to do a show now?

32:45.520 --> 32:46.880
Because I was just there, Atlanta.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.600
Atlanta, we can knock those both out in one trip.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.320
Not a big deal.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.240
Not even a big deal.

32:52.240 --> 32:55.440
Can we also do one in Savannah or is that too close to Atlanta?

32:55.440 --> 32:56.320
Oh, I love that.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.440
Get down to Tybee.

32:57.440 --> 33:02.240
Get down to Tybee for a fucking just beach vacation bash.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.840
Get down to that island life.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.680
I would love to do a fucking show with the beach in the background

33:07.680 --> 33:09.280
and just the waves behind me.

33:09.280 --> 33:09.920
Just like getting powered by that.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.760
I'd love to do a show with the Beach Boys

33:11.760 --> 33:13.760
where I'm just playing drums for them.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.720
I would love to do that with the Beach Boys together.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.120
Yeah, I love that.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.320
Just us and the Beach Boys.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.040
What a better pairing could there be?

33:23.040 --> 33:26.080
Alexi, Alexi, are you listening?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.520
It's me, Justin.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.280
I have a message for you, Alexi.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.840
It's from Allie, Ash, Ollie, and Natalie.

33:32.720 --> 33:33.840
Hey, Alexi.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.360
We all love you very much

33:35.360 --> 33:37.760
and we wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.920
Thank you for rolling into our lives

33:39.920 --> 33:42.960
and making us laugh about pooping your baby diaper

33:42.960 --> 33:44.640
while playing Fallout 4.

33:44.640 --> 33:48.000
We're so jazzed that a literal angel brought you to us

33:48.000 --> 33:49.840
with all the joy and support you've given us

33:49.840 --> 33:50.720
in just a few months.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.400
We love you, baby boy.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.040
That is so sweet.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.560
And that's for Alexi.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.080
It's a happy birthday, Alexi.

33:59.040 --> 33:59.520
What?

33:59.520 --> 33:59.920
Is it?

34:02.080 --> 34:04.400
Sometimes, sometimes, some crimes

34:04.960 --> 34:06.240
go slipping through the cracks.

34:06.240 --> 34:09.760
Do you think that this is for an actual baby

34:10.640 --> 34:15.440
or all of these just inside jokes for a grown person?

34:15.440 --> 34:17.840
You know, I hope not

34:17.840 --> 34:20.400
because Fallout 4 was rated

34:20.400 --> 34:22.800
by the Entertainment Software Review Board

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
as being M for mature audiences

34:24.800 --> 34:27.040
because of graphic violence and probably cussing.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.280
And if a baby played it,

34:29.280 --> 34:30.640
it would literally ruin that.

34:30.640 --> 34:32.080
It would literally ruin that baby.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.480
That baby would be, yeah, worthless at that point.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.680
Because right from the beginning,

34:35.680 --> 34:36.560
if a baby was there,

34:36.560 --> 34:37.840
when everybody's running around like,

34:37.840 --> 34:39.920
fuck, a bomb, it would be like,

34:39.920 --> 34:42.000
whoa, hold on, babies shouldn't be hearing that.

34:42.000 --> 34:42.640
And they'd be like,

34:42.640 --> 34:44.640
fuck, all this radiation everywhere

34:44.640 --> 34:46.480
made these fucking ants so big.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.840
And then the ant bites you in the torso

34:49.840 --> 34:52.160
and you just hacksaw ridge all over the place.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.720
You can't let a baby see that shit.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.160
Are you easily confused

34:56.160 --> 34:58.880
by terms like cultural appropriation,

34:58.880 --> 35:00.640
cisgender, and woke?

35:00.640 --> 35:02.160
Or maybe you find yourself

35:02.160 --> 35:04.160
constantly explaining terms like these

35:04.160 --> 35:05.440
and you need a place to vent.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.920
Do you have a love for all things

35:07.920 --> 35:11.200
pop culture, social commentary, and politics?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.760
Sounds like you need Minority Corner.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.480
Where you can learn, laugh, and play.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.840
Sounds like blues clues.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.200
Only it's more black, gay, and ladylike.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.200
James and Anika will happily administer

35:23.200 --> 35:24.880
your weekly dose each and every Friday.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.480
You can listen on Maximum Fun

35:26.480 --> 35:27.840
or wherever you get your podcast.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.800
Minority Corner.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.520
With a K.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.280
Because the C was taken.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.720
This one was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.600
Game recognized game, Rachel Sperling, thank you.

35:37.600 --> 35:42.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Alkexis who says,

35:42.800 --> 35:47.920
is it weird if two strangers had a mutual agreement

35:47.920 --> 35:52.240
to lean on each other on a plane?

35:52.240 --> 35:54.400
Lehin, you're on a long flight.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.680
Is it weird to ask the passenger

35:55.680 --> 35:57.200
sitting next to you before you take off

35:57.200 --> 35:59.520
if you could lean on them to sleep

35:59.520 --> 36:00.720
and they could lean on you?

36:00.720 --> 36:02.080
Would you take this offer?

36:02.800 --> 36:03.600
Well, no.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.400
Because if you're both leaning on each other,

36:06.400 --> 36:08.240
you're getting only half the lean.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.960
Well, okay, hold on.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.180
So.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.240
Because you'd be forming an equilateral triangle

36:16.240 --> 36:18.960
where you wanna do, is it isosceles?

36:18.960 --> 36:21.360
You wanna lean all the way over with them sitting

36:21.360 --> 36:23.280
at like a 90, they're straight up and down

36:23.280 --> 36:24.240
and you're leaning against them.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.680
So you're getting maximum lean.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.280
Maybe you trade off, maybe take turns leaning.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.800
How long is the flight?

36:30.800 --> 36:32.640
Like there are a lot of factors here.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.640
How tall is the person?

36:34.640 --> 36:36.240
What angle are you gonna be leaning at?

36:36.240 --> 36:37.280
You know what I mean?

36:37.280 --> 36:38.960
Is their head on top of your head?

36:38.960 --> 36:40.080
How poofy is their hair?

36:40.080 --> 36:41.360
How poofy is your hair?

36:41.360 --> 36:42.560
And then there's accessory questions.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.240
Do they have padded shoulder pads?

36:44.240 --> 36:46.720
That would be like a comfy pillow for you to lay on.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.040
Big dangly earrings that might get caught in your beard.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.760
Do they have some sort of cheek stink

36:51.760 --> 36:52.960
that you don't wanna be close to?

36:55.200 --> 36:56.720
The problem with this is I'm a fidgeter.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.280
What if I finish the game I'm enjoying

37:01.280 --> 37:05.680
on my Nintendo Switch and I need, not want,

37:05.680 --> 37:09.360
I need to play some more Knights of the Old Republic

37:09.360 --> 37:11.840
on my iPad, a very old video game

37:11.840 --> 37:12.880
that I'm currently enjoying.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.120
What if I need to do that?

37:15.120 --> 37:16.880
Do I tell them like, excuse me,

37:16.880 --> 37:18.640
I have an important announcement.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.000
Excuse me, I have some important news

37:20.000 --> 37:21.280
about our arrangement.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.800
It's changed, the game is changed.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.560
Oh, that's the ultimate, isn't it?

37:24.560 --> 37:26.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's lean on each other.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.120
I'll go first.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.320
And then you do it.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.080
And then you're like, what are you doing?

37:30.080 --> 37:32.320
Excuse me, flight attendant,

37:32.320 --> 37:34.080
look at what this person's done to me.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.480
The fucking most brutal betrayal.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.920
I love that shit.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.400
I get uncomfortable if my elbow touches

37:40.400 --> 37:41.920
the other person's elbow.

37:41.920 --> 37:42.880
So I don't know.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.560
And then let me be clear,

37:44.560 --> 37:46.320
not because I have a problem with contact

37:46.320 --> 37:47.840
with another human being.

37:47.840 --> 37:51.120
I feel bad being in someone,

37:51.120 --> 37:53.920
it makes me feel like Shrek the Ogre

37:53.920 --> 37:55.200
to like just go-

37:55.200 --> 37:55.840
Now which one is that?

37:55.840 --> 37:56.960
Swamping through the world.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.960
He's the big green one with the horns,

37:58.960 --> 38:01.520
with like his head, it looks like trumpets.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.400
And I feel bad moving through the world

38:04.400 --> 38:07.120
just putting my elbows against other people

38:07.120 --> 38:09.280
and saying, this is my space now.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.720
I'm taking this armrest.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.360
I'm gonna lean on you and drool on your tweed coat.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.880
But this makes me feel bad.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.080
I want you to imagine you're on that flight

38:20.080 --> 38:22.560
to Hong Kong, about 13 hours.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.120
You are wiped out.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.640
13 hours is such a long time to be seated.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.080
And so you don't have this conversation

38:30.080 --> 38:33.200
with your neighbors because it would be uncomfortable.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.800
But then you look at the people in front of you

38:34.800 --> 38:37.680
and they are full blown Bubba Gump,

38:37.680 --> 38:41.920
person TP together with each other.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.280
And you think like, fuck, that looks nice.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.840
Cause they're getting the best sleep of their lives

38:47.840 --> 38:50.240
touching a stranger and they're gonna get to Hong Kong

38:50.240 --> 38:51.200
and they're gonna be all refreshed.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.960
And you are not because you were afraid

38:52.960 --> 38:54.240
to have this conversation.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.240
I had a wonderful moment.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.640
I think it was when I was flying back from Portland.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.040
It was near the end of the boarding process

39:05.040 --> 39:06.000
and there was a seat.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.840
It was a three across seat.

39:07.840 --> 39:10.880
And I was at the window and my neighbor

39:10.880 --> 39:13.760
was in the middle seat and no one was in the aisle seat.

39:14.320 --> 39:17.120
And what I realized through body language,

39:17.120 --> 39:21.360
both of us were just staring at the door.

39:22.480 --> 39:26.240
And as soon as the flight attendant closed the door

39:26.240 --> 39:27.760
and that seat was still empty,

39:29.200 --> 39:32.800
they were in the aisle seat a nanosecond later

39:32.800 --> 39:35.600
without any, and we didn't communicate about it.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.600
It was not like if that seat stays open,

39:37.600 --> 39:40.720
we take this seat and we share it.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.240
Half is your empty space and have it.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.440
They did it.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.040
And all I wanted to do was turn towards them

39:45.040 --> 39:47.200
and be like, yes, you've done it.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.800
You saw it, thank you.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.000
It was just such an amazing,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.320
where it's like there are good people in the world.

39:52.320 --> 39:52.960
There are still good people in the world.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.800
There is kindness, yes.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.640
I gotta read this Yahoo answer response

39:56.640 --> 39:59.440
from Bluebell BKK who says,

39:59.440 --> 40:01.440
I once traveled with a man I didn't know,

40:01.440 --> 40:04.000
but who turned out in preliminary conversation

40:04.000 --> 40:05.760
to be the friend of a friend of mine.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.360
Why is it that people on Yahoo Answers

40:07.360 --> 40:09.360
talk like they're from another fucking planet?

40:10.480 --> 40:14.240
In preliminary conversation, he was at the window,

40:14.240 --> 40:17.120
I was on the aisle and there was an empty seat between us.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.920
We agreed that we would both put our feet up

40:19.920 --> 40:22.160
on the spare seat for extra comfort

40:22.160 --> 40:24.880
and not worry if our legs happened to touch.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.040
We traveled comfortably for the six hour flight.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.480
How did this convo go down?

40:28.480 --> 40:30.720
I'm gonna put my feet up and you can do it too.

40:30.720 --> 40:35.440
And listen, odds are my gams,

40:35.440 --> 40:37.440
your pegs gonna touch.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.480
We might hit some turbulence

40:40.480 --> 40:42.480
and it might just become a leg milkshake.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.560
We might have a little calf to calf contact.

40:45.760 --> 40:46.800
Is that gonna be cool with you?

40:46.800 --> 40:48.880
It's cool with me.

40:49.920 --> 40:50.960
If it's fine with you, let me know.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.680
Little calf to calf, that's a good touch.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.320
That's an unfair deal for the person on the aisle

40:56.320 --> 40:57.360
because if you're against the window,

40:57.360 --> 40:58.560
you can lean your back against the window

40:58.560 --> 41:00.080
and put your feet up in the seat.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.560
But if you're in the aisle,

41:02.560 --> 41:04.640
you're just like leaning into the aisle

41:04.640 --> 41:05.600
to put your feet up.

41:06.240 --> 41:08.080
Ready to get your head touched by butts

41:08.080 --> 41:10.400
and genitals nonstop over and over again.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.560
And just be killed by the drink cart.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.400
Decapitated by a drink cart.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.280
The aisle should be the only seat on an airplane.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.440
There shouldn't be other seats that aren't,

41:19.440 --> 41:22.320
I do not understand people with a window preference

41:22.320 --> 41:23.120
on an airplane.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.120
Why is your preference to,

41:25.120 --> 41:28.080
especially if your flight is longer than 45 minutes long,

41:28.080 --> 41:32.080
I cannot fathom being locked in a human prison.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.520
Hey, you know how much you like social interactions?

41:35.520 --> 41:39.200
How would you like to be forced to have two of them

41:40.800 --> 41:43.360
and everyone knows that you're going to take a shit?

41:45.360 --> 41:46.400
You have to time it out

41:46.400 --> 41:49.040
and anticipate the person coming out of the bathroom.

41:49.040 --> 41:49.920
That's the brutal part.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.560
Because if you make it to the aisle

41:52.560 --> 41:54.480
and someone has just stepped in the bathroom,

41:54.480 --> 41:57.680
you have to sit back down in the most sheepish like,

41:57.680 --> 41:59.360
well, I guess I missed it.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.280
I was three deep in the window

42:02.000 --> 42:04.320
on my flight back from New York on Friday.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.920
Three deep on the window.

42:06.480 --> 42:10.000
And I immediately recognized this was a problem for me

42:10.000 --> 42:12.320
and where I'm at as a person on Earth today.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.440
I sat down, put on that good Delta screen.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.120
I turned around, saw the movies.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.440
Oh, Fantastic Beasts and How to Get All of Them.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.120
Fucking great.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.000
Tuned in.

42:22.000 --> 42:22.720
How to Catch Them All.

42:22.720 --> 42:26.480
The whole time I'm watching Eddie Redman do his business.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.200
And collect all these wonderful beats.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.480
The whole time I'm thinking like,

42:31.200 --> 42:33.200
piss sounds pretty good right about now.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.880
And so I had to ask these people,

42:34.880 --> 42:37.200
one of whom had a bottle of wine that they just opened

42:37.200 --> 42:38.160
and it sat out on their tray

42:38.160 --> 42:40.080
and the other one was doing important work

42:40.080 --> 42:42.000
on their laptop that they had sat on the tray.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.160
I was like, hey, I need to disrupt

42:44.160 --> 42:47.280
both of your guys' whole shit for like 10 minutes

42:47.280 --> 42:48.160
and don't get comfortable

42:48.160 --> 42:50.480
because you know I'm going to be coming back.

42:50.480 --> 42:51.760
And so I did my business.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.560
I came back to sit down to enjoy Eddie Redman

42:54.560 --> 42:57.600
and I'm not kidding, I put the earbuds back in my ears

42:57.600 --> 42:58.720
and I press play on the movie

42:58.720 --> 43:01.600
and almost instantly I started panicking about like,

43:01.600 --> 43:02.960
I know I'm going to need to piss again

43:02.960 --> 43:03.920
before this flight is up

43:03.920 --> 43:05.200
and it's all I could think about.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.280
Like, I just watched Colin Farrell

43:07.280 --> 43:08.800
do his acting up on the screen

43:08.800 --> 43:10.640
and Eddie Redman do his thing up on the screen

43:10.640 --> 43:11.600
and the whole time I'm like,

43:11.600 --> 43:13.680
I wish I could enjoy this beast capture movie

43:13.680 --> 43:15.440
but the whole time it's just like,

43:15.440 --> 43:16.640
when's that next piss going to come?

43:16.640 --> 43:17.840
And sure enough, it did.

43:17.840 --> 43:19.280
And I had to be like, I'm so sick.

43:19.280 --> 43:22.320
One person was like building a model ship

43:22.320 --> 43:23.440
on their fucking thing

43:23.440 --> 43:26.160
and one of them was painting like an anime mech model

43:26.160 --> 43:28.320
and I was like, I need you to put all the caps back

43:28.320 --> 43:29.920
on your mini jars of acrylic paint

43:29.920 --> 43:32.160
so I can go take my second piss in an hour.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.840
Three deep in the window, dude.

43:35.840 --> 43:36.480
Never again.

43:43.280 --> 43:43.780
Shit.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.600
Can we all just agree?

43:45.600 --> 43:46.880
Can we agree from now on

43:46.880 --> 43:48.720
if the person in the window seat gets up

43:48.720 --> 43:49.920
to go to the bathroom,

43:49.920 --> 43:52.720
everybody fucking mad had a tea party,

43:52.720 --> 43:55.600
change places, scoot one seat over, rotate.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.120
Oh shit, that's good.

43:58.400 --> 43:59.920
If you have to get up to go to the bathroom,

43:59.920 --> 44:01.600
then you've earned the aisle seat

44:01.600 --> 44:02.560
because you've proven yourself

44:03.840 --> 44:05.680
the bathroom user of the group.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.280
I'm the worst.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.400
I would be the worst person on like a red,

44:10.400 --> 44:12.480
I would never want to be next to me on a red eye

44:12.480 --> 44:14.480
because if I'm on a red eye flight,

44:14.480 --> 44:15.520
I'm going to sleep.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.560
That's a whole production.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.520
One, I'm in the aisle

44:19.520 --> 44:22.640
and then I'm full sensory deprivation chamber

44:22.640 --> 44:24.480
wrapping myself in blankets,

44:24.480 --> 44:26.480
mask on, noise canceling.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.960
You're fucking 11 floating in the saltwater tank.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.120
You are not getting, shit your pants.

44:33.120 --> 44:34.080
You're not getting past me.

44:34.080 --> 44:34.640
Shit your pants.

44:34.640 --> 44:35.680
I'm in the upside down.

44:35.680 --> 44:36.480
Fuck off.

44:36.480 --> 44:36.980
No way.

44:38.640 --> 44:39.920
I can't sleep on a plane.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.200
So if you're next to me on a red light,

44:41.200 --> 44:42.400
you'll just hear me occasionally go,

44:44.640 --> 44:45.440
I hate this.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.920
I hate this so much.

44:47.920 --> 44:50.080
And enough airplane humor, I think.

44:50.880 --> 44:51.920
What's the deal with the food?

44:51.920 --> 44:52.480
Am I right?

44:53.280 --> 44:53.780
Yeah.

44:54.320 --> 44:57.280
Yeah, that's our airplane jokes.

44:57.840 --> 45:00.160
Today I texted my partner to pick up cat litter

45:00.160 --> 45:01.200
while she was out.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.600
Only problem is I didn't text her.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.760
I texted the service department at the dealership

45:05.760 --> 45:07.200
where my car is being repaired.

45:08.800 --> 45:09.840
There's a reason for this.

45:09.840 --> 45:10.960
This is too long to read.

45:10.960 --> 45:13.600
I may or may not have included several poop emojis.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.840
They replied asking what brand.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.240
Then after I tried to laugh it off with a low whoops,

45:18.240 --> 45:20.560
they doubled down and said they would go get the cat litter

45:20.560 --> 45:21.060
for me.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.800
I haven't responded and I'm supposed to pick up my car

45:24.800 --> 45:27.200
tomorrow and I'm terrified that they'll bring it up.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.680
Or worse, maybe they did get the litter.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.480
Should I say yes to their offer?

45:33.040 --> 45:35.040
Should I just cut my losses and forget about my car?

45:36.240 --> 45:36.800
Please help.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.880
That's from Scooping Scat in St. Petersburg.

45:38.880 --> 45:39.380
Wow.

45:40.960 --> 45:42.400
That's a good car dealership.

45:42.400 --> 45:46.880
That's a very, well, yeah, no, it's not.

45:46.880 --> 45:49.600
Because they spent, what, $6 on this box of cat litter

45:49.600 --> 45:51.760
and you come in to pick it up and then you bought it

45:51.760 --> 45:52.800
for the rest of your life.

45:52.800 --> 45:55.760
You continue to buy your $20,000 automobile.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.360
This is a very small investment.

45:57.360 --> 45:59.200
I'm surprised they don't do shit like this more often.

45:59.680 --> 46:02.000
I never got a text from my Volkswagen dealership like,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.960
hey, sorry, we lied to you and oops,

46:04.960 --> 46:06.080
you're going to have to go through a bunch of stuff.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.640
Can we bring you some hot dogs?

46:08.640 --> 46:11.520
I would fucking, yeah, that'd be great actually.

46:11.520 --> 46:12.880
Bring it on by.

46:12.880 --> 46:16.240
If I relate to question asking this because,

46:16.240 --> 46:19.520
because my thought if somebody was like,

46:19.520 --> 46:20.560
no, we'll get it.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.040
All I can think is like, okay, that's what you say.

46:23.840 --> 46:27.280
But are you all just like sitting in like the repair bay

46:27.280 --> 46:31.280
just fucking laughing your faces off at how stupid I am?

46:31.280 --> 46:32.560
And I'm going to roll up and you're all,

46:32.560 --> 46:35.200
you're going to be all smiles and you're going to hand me

46:35.200 --> 46:37.280
my, you know, tidy cat or whatever.

46:37.280 --> 46:39.360
But I'm going to like, what am I?

46:39.360 --> 46:41.680
I'm going to say thank you and be grateful to you

46:41.680 --> 46:44.000
while you just cackled about how dumb I was

46:44.000 --> 46:47.440
to send you this text and like, I won't know

46:47.440 --> 46:50.880
and you won't say and it'll be kind of weird.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.040
But what if I show up and it's not there?

46:53.040 --> 46:55.280
Do I be like, hey, where's my cat?

46:55.280 --> 46:57.600
You can't roll up to any sort of car dealership

46:57.600 --> 46:59.360
and be like, where's my cat litter?

46:59.360 --> 47:01.680
It's like, this is a car dealership.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.160
My cat's been holding her piss for 24 hours

47:04.160 --> 47:04.960
just waiting for this.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.600
My apartment reeks of piss and shit.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.720
Where's my cat litter?

47:08.720 --> 47:10.720
Like, this is a Mazda dealership.

47:10.720 --> 47:14.400
I would be so worried that they would get the wrong,

47:14.400 --> 47:15.840
even if it's the right brand,

47:15.840 --> 47:17.520
they wouldn't get the exact right.

47:18.080 --> 47:20.080
My babies are very particular

47:20.080 --> 47:23.920
about their Dr. Elsley's cat attract

47:23.920 --> 47:28.480
that they enjoy using and I really would not want to trust.

47:28.480 --> 47:32.160
I can't find it in local stores, if you know what I mean.

47:32.160 --> 47:36.000
I can't find it in the big box, some of the big boxes

47:36.000 --> 47:38.720
because my babies are very particular about

47:38.720 --> 47:39.920
where they do their thing.

47:39.920 --> 47:44.640
Travis, please tell me what you do, Travis,

47:44.640 --> 47:48.800
because I no longer want to continue talking about what I do

47:48.800 --> 47:49.920
in a funny joke way.

47:51.360 --> 47:54.160
The one thing I was hoping while I was talking about that

47:54.160 --> 47:56.800
is fuck, I hope Travis has something to tell me

47:56.800 --> 48:00.080
about cat litter because I am just mid-sentence

48:00.080 --> 48:01.680
and I don't know how to finish it.

48:01.680 --> 48:03.360
What do people put me in a sentence?

48:03.360 --> 48:06.720
Well, the one thing, Trav, I really was hoping that you would-

48:06.720 --> 48:07.920
Justin, imagine my relief.

48:07.920 --> 48:08.880
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

48:09.680 --> 48:12.400
Imagine my relief that my brother Travis was there

48:12.400 --> 48:14.160
to help me out of the sentence I was in.

48:14.160 --> 48:14.960
You're welcome.

48:14.960 --> 48:15.680
You are welcome.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.360
I was a few clauses in.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.800
What was next, a preposition?

48:18.800 --> 48:20.240
Alley-oop this ball for you.

48:20.240 --> 48:20.960
Interjection?

48:20.960 --> 48:21.840
I had no idea.

48:22.480 --> 48:25.840
So happy that Travis is here to deliver me.

48:25.840 --> 48:28.320
So please, I'm all ears, Travis.

48:28.320 --> 48:33.760
Travis, I get the tiny cat, the one with the black lid

48:33.760 --> 48:36.400
that is like multiple cat strength,

48:36.400 --> 48:40.080
even though I only have the one pretty tiny cat

48:40.080 --> 48:43.360
because, and I don't know why everyone doesn't do this,

48:43.360 --> 48:46.480
I don't want to smell my cat's piss and shit.

48:47.600 --> 48:51.280
So why wouldn't I get the one that's four times as powerful

48:51.280 --> 48:53.760
at masking odors as the basic one?

48:53.760 --> 48:55.920
Because your fucking cat lowers,

48:55.920 --> 48:58.960
your cat lowers their bung a little bit too much

48:58.960 --> 49:01.040
into that stuff and it just dissolves.

49:01.040 --> 49:02.560
They are corroded.

49:02.560 --> 49:03.760
What are you talking about?

49:03.760 --> 49:05.200
I don't understand why everybody just doesn't get

49:05.200 --> 49:07.040
nuclear waste for their cats to shit in

49:07.040 --> 49:08.720
that the cat will essentially dissolve in

49:08.720 --> 49:10.560
as soon as it looks or touches it.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.160
What are you talking about?

49:12.160 --> 49:14.160
I tried to do lavender scented once

49:14.160 --> 49:17.680
and the cat was not fucking having it at all.

49:17.680 --> 49:20.480
She was like, hey, this is my shit dirt.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.600
What are you doing?

49:21.600 --> 49:23.680
Do you think that I, a cat out in nature,

49:23.680 --> 49:26.080
would just find some lavender sand?

49:26.080 --> 49:27.120
Come on.

49:27.120 --> 49:30.080
I'm gonna exercise my, I'm exercising my veto power

49:30.080 --> 49:32.400
right now because I want to hear about

49:32.400 --> 49:34.720
where Justin gets his fancy cat litter for his babies.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.760
Take that, take that, rewind it back.

49:39.280 --> 49:43.040
In 2014, I kickstarted a brand new kind of cat litter.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.080
I'm still waiting.

49:44.640 --> 49:48.560
It's not here yet, but they say it's very good for cats

49:48.560 --> 49:50.560
and it helps them have lucid dreams.

49:50.560 --> 49:55.440
Yeah, lucid dreaming litter.

49:55.440 --> 49:56.640
See, this is why it's good sometimes

49:56.640 --> 49:58.480
when Travis interrupts me because then I had time

49:58.480 --> 50:00.720
to think of that very funny joke.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.320
It wasn't, sorry, sorry listeners.

50:04.320 --> 50:05.440
That one wasn't true.

50:06.080 --> 50:11.120
You just got zinged by a joking J-Man, the jokester.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.480
Jokes is back in the room.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.400
He was actually in the corner the entire time.

50:14.400 --> 50:16.400
He slipped in while Travis so rudely interrupted me

50:16.400 --> 50:16.720
as he often does.

50:16.720 --> 50:17.600
That's why I did it.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.720
I covered for him.

50:18.720 --> 50:21.280
Thanks, Jokes.

50:21.280 --> 50:23.760
I have to say non-funny things for a couple minutes

50:23.760 --> 50:26.240
so Jokes can have a sip of his coffee

50:26.240 --> 50:30.000
and put his paper down and really just sit there

50:30.000 --> 50:31.600
for a minute and think about,

50:31.600 --> 50:33.760
and then he hands a note card to Justin

50:33.760 --> 50:36.480
with kitty litter that facilitates lucid dreaming on it.

50:37.040 --> 50:38.320
Justin's like, thank you, Jokes,

50:38.320 --> 50:40.800
and Jokes just kind of nods and then leaves.

50:41.760 --> 50:43.760
Jokes has been kind of a prima donna lately.

50:43.760 --> 50:47.040
I think we've hit a certain level of notoriety

50:47.040 --> 50:52.720
that Jokes feels like they can kind of push us around

50:52.720 --> 50:56.080
a little bit, sort of like the Friends cast.

50:56.080 --> 50:56.880
You know what I mean?

50:56.880 --> 50:58.480
I'm not fucking stepping foot into the studio

50:58.480 --> 50:59.520
for less than 20 Gs.

51:00.960 --> 51:02.000
Can I read this Yahoo?

51:02.720 --> 51:03.120
Yeah, please.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.000
It's from Maddie Miller.

51:04.000 --> 51:04.560
Thank you, Maddie.

51:04.560 --> 51:05.120
It's from Yahoo!

51:05.120 --> 51:06.720
Mancers user.

51:06.720 --> 51:08.720
They are anonymous, but I'll call them.

51:08.720 --> 51:15.920
Ross asks, am I allowed to hold dance classes

51:15.920 --> 51:18.080
in the sewer?

51:18.080 --> 51:20.560
I want to start teaching contemporary dance

51:20.560 --> 51:22.880
and was wanting to teach it in an area that's private

51:22.880 --> 51:24.800
so my students wouldn't feel embarrassed,

51:24.800 --> 51:26.400
but I can't afford to rent a building

51:26.400 --> 51:28.320
and thought the sewers would be a great place

51:28.320 --> 51:29.760
to hold the classes at.

51:29.760 --> 51:32.000
I just wanted to know if you are allowed to do it.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.080
This isn't real.

51:34.080 --> 51:35.600
There's no way, I'm sorry.

51:36.640 --> 51:40.160
Sometimes people get a little rambunctious

51:40.160 --> 51:42.720
on oath answers and they say things

51:42.720 --> 51:43.920
that I don't think are true.

51:43.920 --> 51:45.760
And to me, I think this is a joke.

51:45.760 --> 51:49.360
There is one scenario in which this might be real, Justin.

51:50.000 --> 51:50.720
This person-

51:50.720 --> 51:53.280
Uh, teach you Ninja Turtles dance classes.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.400
No, but also that.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.160
But this person, they're thinking,

51:56.160 --> 51:59.440
oh, would I hold these underground dance classes

52:00.240 --> 52:03.520
and then maybe they watch that scene from Guys and Dolls.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.080
Yes.

52:04.080 --> 52:06.720
And would they have the craps game in the sewer

52:06.720 --> 52:09.760
in the biggest fucking like pipe distribution-

52:09.760 --> 52:11.600
Coolest sewer ever.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.800
Yeah, and they're like,

52:12.800 --> 52:16.400
underground dance classes underground, of course.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.000
Let me hit you with three arguments.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.760
Three arguments.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.840
One is free real estate down there.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.560
It's the sewers and you don't have to worry about it.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.880
It's the sewers and you don't have to worry about it.

52:26.880 --> 52:28.720
Can I go open up a manhole cover

52:28.720 --> 52:32.960
and just go subterranean and like, I'm cool?

52:32.960 --> 52:34.160
I'm cool down there, right?

52:34.160 --> 52:35.360
Nobody's gonna, what are you doing?

52:35.360 --> 52:36.800
Hey, what are you doing in the sewers?

52:36.800 --> 52:38.320
It's like, it's the sewers.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.520
It's the sewers, I'm just down here.

52:41.520 --> 52:43.200
Am I not allowed to be down here?

52:43.200 --> 52:44.800
It's just like a sidewalk underground.

52:44.800 --> 52:45.600
It's the sewers.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.720
Let me keep doing my dance class.

52:46.720 --> 52:48.800
Number two, contemporary dance.

52:48.800 --> 52:52.000
Justin, you're telling me the sewers is not a dope ass place.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.440
You're telling me fucking Travis Wall

52:53.440 --> 52:56.240
has not fucking choreographed a sewer-based dance.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.320
You're out of your mind, of course he has.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.800
Number three, all that tapping and shuffling

53:00.800 --> 53:02.160
is gonna sound pretty good echoing down

53:02.160 --> 53:05.040
those long, long sewer hallways, whatever those are called.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.000
So I think maybe go fuck yourself.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Here's the thing, Justin.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.080
Justin, Justin, you might not understand this,

53:12.080 --> 53:15.520
but there are two things legally no one owns.

53:16.160 --> 53:19.600
And that is the sky and the sewers.

53:19.600 --> 53:19.840
Yes.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.080
Nobody owns the sewers.

53:22.080 --> 53:23.840
They've just always been there.

53:23.840 --> 53:24.960
They've always been there.

53:26.720 --> 53:29.120
Carrying our ship, carrying our ship from us,

53:29.120 --> 53:31.680
waiting for me to do my cool dances in it.

53:31.680 --> 53:35.200
So Justin, your rebuttal about how this is a fake joke, please.

53:36.000 --> 53:36.960
Now that I think about it,

53:36.960 --> 53:40.560
it would be pretty great to be doing all of my moves.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.560
And then when the choreographer's like,

53:42.560 --> 53:44.400
where did you learn steps like that?

53:44.400 --> 53:47.280
I look at him all haughty and I'm like, the sewer?

53:47.840 --> 53:49.360
That's where I got it, of course.

53:50.240 --> 53:52.480
Now, I will say this.

53:53.200 --> 53:54.720
You're doing your step ball change

53:56.080 --> 53:58.240
and you ball change into a human turd.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.240
End of dance, end of career.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.440
This is not ideal.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.280
This is not ideal.

54:05.280 --> 54:07.200
Travis Wall would be like, why did you fall down?

54:07.200 --> 54:09.440
And be like, Travis, I have a pretty good reason for this one.

54:09.920 --> 54:12.960
Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, not Nigel Farage.

54:12.960 --> 54:17.600
Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel Thornberry is like,

54:17.600 --> 54:20.960
it was a good dance until you totally stepped on

54:20.960 --> 54:22.640
and hacksaw ridged that turd,

54:22.640 --> 54:24.320
that human turd all over the place.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.000
And it was rough stuff.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.200
It was really rough and tough.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.200
Me, Nigel, and Paul.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.320
I love your style.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.760
I love your moves.

54:31.760 --> 54:34.480
It does constantly look like you're on high alert

54:34.480 --> 54:36.480
to step in human dookie.

54:36.480 --> 54:39.600
Paul is like, I kind of like when you made the turd explode

54:39.600 --> 54:41.680
by dancing, stepping on it really hard.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.040
I kind of liked it.

54:43.040 --> 54:44.000
It was very evocative.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.760
It added to Travis's choreography.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.320
I'm here for my audition.

54:48.320 --> 54:49.440
Oh, good, come on in.

54:49.440 --> 54:50.720
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

54:50.720 --> 54:52.320
Yes, it's going to be very good.

54:52.320 --> 54:54.400
The one thing is to help me get comfortable.

54:54.400 --> 54:58.480
I was wondering if I could spread human feces

54:58.480 --> 55:01.920
and McDonald's wrappers all over the floor of this place

55:01.920 --> 55:03.920
so I can do the dancing good.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.040
Because that's how I hit my marks.

55:05.840 --> 55:06.640
Of course.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.680
Of course, of course.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.360
Why would you even ask?

55:12.880 --> 55:13.760
This is dance.

55:16.320 --> 55:19.120
That's my favorite scene in Center Stage, by the way.

55:19.120 --> 55:22.080
Where they teach that class about how to hit your poop marks.

55:23.360 --> 55:25.760
I've seen Center Stage way too many times in my life.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.800
It doesn't sound like you actually have maybe at all.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.200
Yeah, maybe not even once.

55:31.200 --> 55:31.680
It's been a while.

55:31.680 --> 55:35.360
I have a hard time remembering if there's a scene where they dance on turds or not.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.800
It's in the director's cut.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.080
I wouldn't Google that, folks.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.160
That's gonna lead you down to dark rabbit holes.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.240
Just leave that as a mystery for the ages.

55:46.240 --> 55:49.040
Dark rabbit holes is another good place to teach dance.

55:49.040 --> 55:49.520
Yeah, it's true.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.120
Hey, rabbits, clear out.

55:51.120 --> 55:51.840
Time to boogie.

55:54.560 --> 55:56.240
I think, let's call it there.

55:56.240 --> 55:59.840
Let's say that that's an entire episode of our podcast program.

55:59.840 --> 56:02.640
Thank you so much for listening to it.

56:02.640 --> 56:03.920
We very much appreciate you.

56:05.200 --> 56:05.840
We always do.

56:06.400 --> 56:08.240
Here's one we haven't asked about in a while.

56:08.240 --> 56:12.880
If you enjoy our program and you would like to help other people enjoy it,

56:12.880 --> 56:18.560
one of the best ways you can do that is go to iTunes and find our podcast

56:18.560 --> 56:22.800
and leave us a rating and ideally a review if you enjoy the program

56:22.800 --> 56:27.680
because a lot of podcast visibility is determined by that.

56:27.680 --> 56:31.760
And a bunch of y'all have been kind enough to do that recently.

56:32.960 --> 56:39.840
But if you have not done that, it would really be great if you would do that.

56:39.840 --> 56:42.000
I'm just gonna tell a few recent people.

56:42.960 --> 56:44.720
Ali P. said, fun show.

56:45.680 --> 56:48.640
God Away Carson said, I didn't like it, but now I pay for it.

56:48.640 --> 56:50.640
So I don't know what that is.

56:50.640 --> 56:54.240
Ha Ha Zombies, good goose from some good boys.

56:54.240 --> 56:55.280
A lot of great reviews in there.

56:55.280 --> 56:58.800
If you could leave us one of those, that would just be the best.

56:58.800 --> 56:59.600
Thank you so much.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.320
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

57:02.320 --> 57:03.920
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

57:03.920 --> 57:05.200
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:06.240 --> 57:09.120
I say this every week, but it really is fucking super, super good.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.400
I was listening to some non It's a Departure tracks off that album the other day

57:12.400 --> 57:15.200
and it's just front to back, it's all bangers.

57:16.800 --> 57:20.080
I wanna do a quick, we're on the maximumfun.org network.

57:20.640 --> 57:24.560
I wanna do a quick plug for one of the shows on the network

57:24.560 --> 57:26.480
that's been crushing it lately called We Got This,

57:27.280 --> 57:29.280
where they try to settle a debate.

57:29.280 --> 57:34.720
Very recently, you could hear Ted Leo talk about the best breakfast cereal

57:35.520 --> 57:40.160
and Weird Al Yankovic talk about the best Money Python song.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.040
Like come on.

57:41.040 --> 57:47.440
I'm also on an episode, me and Ben Blacker talk about Batman or Superman.

57:47.440 --> 57:54.320
I am team Superman and I get real ganged up on by Mr. Gagliardi and Mr. Blacker.

57:54.320 --> 57:58.080
It is an unfair show for liars and cheats and swindlers.

57:59.200 --> 58:02.000
But it's a great program, so go listen to We Got This.

58:02.560 --> 58:06.240
If you wanna find all the shows that McElroy's work on,

58:06.240 --> 58:08.080
we have a website called McElroyShows.com.

58:08.080 --> 58:12.160
It also has our PO box, mailing addresses, email addresses.

58:12.160 --> 58:15.200
And I also, I realized that with all those shows we do,

58:15.200 --> 58:16.480
it might get a little confusing.

58:16.480 --> 58:21.120
So I made a handy dandy weekly schedule of like release,

58:21.120 --> 58:23.360
what day of the week shows come out on,

58:23.360 --> 58:25.680
so you can tell people and direct them towards that,

58:26.480 --> 58:27.840
if that might be helpful to you.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.880
McElroyShows.com.

58:31.520 --> 58:32.160
And let's see.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.080
Oh, Jonah Ray is gonna be on the show.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.160
You probably know him from a bunch of stuff, but mostly.

58:38.880 --> 58:42.960
He has recently started the new Mystery Sense Theater 3000 reboot,

58:43.600 --> 58:44.640
which is awesome.

58:44.640 --> 58:47.840
And I have watched a bunch of episodes and thoroughly enjoy it.

58:47.840 --> 58:49.040
So if you have questions for him,

58:49.040 --> 58:54.000
we know that one of his topics is going to be zombies and zombie related questions.

58:54.960 --> 58:58.240
We'll probably have additional topics that we will tweet about.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.640
But if you're thinking about zombie related questions,

59:00.640 --> 59:02.000
go ahead and email those in now.

59:02.880 --> 59:05.840
And just put Jonah somewhere in the subject line.

59:07.760 --> 59:08.480
What else?

59:08.480 --> 59:10.720
Oh, oh, oh, and start getting in your questions

59:10.720 --> 59:13.200
for the Austin live show in a month.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.200
Yeah, so if you've got those questions,

59:15.200 --> 59:18.000
start sending them in with Austin live show in the subject.

59:18.000 --> 59:18.720
All right.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.480
I'm gonna be doing this Thursday.

59:21.120 --> 59:24.320
I'm gonna be at the Columbus Podcast Festival.

59:24.320 --> 59:26.320
Doing, we're doing Still Buffering,

59:26.320 --> 59:31.920
Court Appointed and Sawbones on Thursday at the Columbus Podcast Festival.

59:31.920 --> 59:33.280
So come on out.

59:33.280 --> 59:37.040
Come, just Google that and you'll find the place to buy a ticket.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.400
Tickets are not bad.

59:38.400 --> 59:39.440
They're like $10.

59:39.440 --> 59:40.240
It's a two night event.

59:40.240 --> 59:43.920
But if you, it's $10 for one night, $20 for two nights.

59:43.920 --> 59:45.200
So come on out.

59:45.200 --> 59:45.920
That's gonna be fun.

59:45.920 --> 59:48.240
Do y'all want a final?

59:48.240 --> 59:48.560
Yes.

59:48.560 --> 59:49.200
Yes.

59:49.200 --> 59:51.280
This final Yahoo was sent in by Morgan Davey.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.080
Keep it wavy.

59:52.080 --> 59:52.720
Morgan Davey.

59:52.720 --> 59:53.920
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

59:53.920 --> 59:55.520
Sorry, something's going wrong.

59:55.520 --> 59:56.880
But we'll call them Charles.

59:57.440 --> 59:58.240
Charles asks,

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.120
is there a clean version of tub thumping by Chumbawamba?

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.960
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.320
They do say piss a lot in that one.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.600
This has been my brother, my brother.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.400
May kiss your dad.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.360
Square on the lips.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:46.880
So the 2017 Max Fund Drive was a huge success.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.720
Thank you so much to everyone who joined or upgraded during the drive

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.520

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.440
going to our friends at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.120
Yeah.
