WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.680
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's my brother, my brother, and me at Advice

00:47.680 --> 00:53.200
Show for the modern era, our special Labor Day edition of our program.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.440
Yeah, that means- We didn't stop working. What's that?

00:55.440 --> 01:02.000
It's Labor Day, baby. It's time to split those giant giants wide open and get some babies out

01:02.000 --> 01:08.960
of them. Let's induce this Labor Day. Let's induce this Labor Day and give birth to a new day for

01:08.960 --> 01:17.040
our nation. I don't think it's both ethically and morally dubious Labor Day, because I don't

01:17.040 --> 01:22.480
think it's right to induce the labor just so that you can participate in the holiday. I don't think

01:22.480 --> 01:27.440
it's right to plan your conception nine months ahead of time, which would be, that's like what,

01:27.440 --> 01:31.920
early December or something like that. Who the fuck wants to have sex in early December?

01:31.920 --> 01:35.920
Not this time. Well, you do it and you stay warm and you don't die in the cold.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.040
True love waits until February. You have all those necessity babies.

01:39.040 --> 01:45.360
Yeah, sure, sure. Boy, if you have your baby on Labor Day and your first words to your baby are,

01:45.360 --> 01:50.720
get it, that baby's going to grow up with a really, really, really great sense of humor.

01:50.720 --> 01:55.440
Well, the problem is, if you have a baby on Labor Day, it's instantly in a union.

01:56.720 --> 02:03.040
Yeah, that's true. And let me tell you, the baby union, their strikes are unscabable.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.880
Can't be done. You cannot scab a baby union. Everyone will know the difference.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.840
How are you going to cross a baby picket line? They're adorable.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.120
It's quite easy. I mean, they're fucking knee high. You can just-

02:13.120 --> 02:15.760
Well, that's what I'm saying. You got to be careful. You'll trip right over them.

02:15.760 --> 02:21.600
Yeah, it is a tripping hazard. And they can bite you. That's babies. And their picket

02:21.600 --> 02:28.080
signs are incoherent. They're nothing. They're just prints of their hands in paint. It's not

02:28.080 --> 02:32.080
even making a really great statement. Unless they're hyper religious or

02:32.080 --> 02:36.160
super politically active parents make them hold the signs. I hate that shit.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.920
That kid does not actually think that God hates fags. I know that as a fact.

02:39.920 --> 02:47.440
That kid, God loves Pogs is what that kid wants to hold up. God, give me more Pokemon cards,

02:47.440 --> 02:53.040
please. I pray every day for them and nothing. Dear God, Yu-Gi-Oh. Signed, Dave. David, the kid.

02:53.040 --> 02:53.840
That's what happens.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.120
He's like Yu-Gi-Oh?

02:55.120 --> 03:00.560
You pray for Jesus to bring you Yu-Gi-Oh cards. And when he doesn't,

03:00.560 --> 03:04.000
you blame the homosexuals. And that's how Fred Phelps was born.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.680
Okay. So he is the ultimate Yu-Gi-Oh master.

03:07.680 --> 03:13.760
No, he would be. He would be if Jesus had brought him some Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

03:13.760 --> 03:20.240
Jesus won't bring him any Yu-Gi-Ohs, so he hates gays. I mean, that's canon at this point, I think.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.960
I guess everything that we've said so far makes sense.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.200
I bet when this episode started that my brother, my brother and me historians weren't ready that

03:29.200 --> 03:33.280
they're going to have to crack open the hall of fame vault to put the baby union bit in.

03:33.280 --> 03:40.240
Protesting babies, Salah Gold.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.800
So soon after they just dipped in last week to put in a...

03:44.800 --> 03:47.200
What hilarious bit from last week did they put in? I forget.

03:47.840 --> 03:48.800
Romney Calatis.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.280
Romney Calatis. They dipped in to put in Romney Calatis,

03:51.280 --> 03:55.440
now they're going to have to trek right back to the hall of fame to put baby unions in.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.160
Guys, let's spread it wide. Let's use our kegels.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.960
Let's not belabor the day.

04:02.960 --> 04:08.480
Let's push this six pound, four ounce. Is that small?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.280
I feel like that's normal. Let's just get this baby of humor out of us.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.280
Let's just get this humor baby out.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.880
The humor is crowning, let's go.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.120
Okay.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.600
These jokes are six centimeters dilating. I can see the top of its goofs.

04:27.120 --> 04:27.760
Hall of fame.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.800
I always have the... Oh, on this show we answer questions, but not...

04:32.800 --> 04:36.560
But usually we just make fun of people, but it's like a question show,

04:36.560 --> 04:38.240
and we'll answer something. Here we go.

04:38.240 --> 04:42.720
I always have the same problem when I'm at a party or out with friends.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.200
For whatever reason, I'm always introduced to new people just after I come out of the bathroom.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.440
My hands are still a little wet from washing,

04:49.440 --> 04:53.680
so now I'm stuck stepping out of a bathroom and immediately giving a damp handshake.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.600
It doesn't make for a good first impression.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.680
So what's the proper response to a handshake request when you have wet hands?

04:59.680 --> 05:03.600
That's washed in Wisconsin. Well washed.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.640
There's so many options.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.840
There's literally dozens, if not hundreds of options.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.960
Can I help you with just like the top one? Just dry your fucking hands.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.120
Dry your fucking hands. That's what your jeans are for.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.360
That's why you have like... That's why they have his and hers.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.080
You know what? That's a new good adult rule.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.960
Don't go to parties unless they have fucking guest towels.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.640
Yeah, if they don't have a guest towel, you need to depart.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.680
You need to walk out of the bathroom with your hands aloft and say,

05:31.680 --> 05:35.280
I am leaving to go home to dry my hands.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.000
I can't meet your new girlfriend right now.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.720
My hands are damp because this party is bullshit.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.640
Why are you shaking anybody's hand? That's a germ factory.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.840
You got to give them elbow bumps, which is the new thing.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.160
I'll do that at a trade show where I don't want to...

05:52.160 --> 05:54.560
Hi, I've never met you. You're from a different country.

05:54.560 --> 05:59.920
Let's just elbow bump because I don't want contagion happening to me.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.720
Sometimes, though, people will get overzealous with the bump

06:02.720 --> 06:08.160
and they'll want to prove to you that they've got some juice in the tip.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.440
Oh, that's the worst.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.360
And it'll turn into a forearm shiver.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.400
Oh, my God.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.200
That's brutal.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.800
Yeah, because your forearm is just like a... It's just a big petri dish.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.520
My... Well, mine is brittle.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.120
Yeah. Your elbow?

06:21.120 --> 06:23.920
It's practically avian. And when people give me a big bash,

06:23.920 --> 06:26.720
it's like, ugh, it really hurts.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.280
What I do in this situation whenever I have not washed or not dried my hands properly...

06:31.280 --> 06:33.680
Okay, so a little bit of Freudian truth in there, but go on.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.080
When I have not dried my hands, I just come out and someone tries to introduce me

06:40.080 --> 06:43.040
and I say, we're not going to shake. We're going to hug.

06:43.040 --> 06:46.240
And then I just hug them and I wipe my hands on their back.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.440
Well, that's a good point because isn't your whole body a little damp?

06:51.280 --> 06:52.080
Excuse me?

06:52.080 --> 06:53.360
Excuse me? Excuse me?

06:53.360 --> 06:57.440
Like when you wash it, you really... You guys just get your hands, huh?

06:57.440 --> 07:00.320
So you're saying like when you're at a party and you use the bathroom,

07:00.320 --> 07:01.440
you take a shower?

07:01.440 --> 07:02.720
You take a quick shower.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.800
I mean, I use the sink. It's not like a full production.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.560
Oh, you take a hobo bath.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.720
Every part of me does. Yeah, I take a library bath.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.000
Every part of me does get wet.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.040
Sure, you get in there.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.520
Let's break this down because we've never really... We've talked about,

07:17.520 --> 07:22.000
I think, probably the politics of hand washing 20 times, but you're not touching...

07:22.000 --> 07:28.480
You're not actually touching like your butthole or your poopy or your pee-pee or your wee.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.280
You know what I'm saying?

07:29.280 --> 07:31.200
Like there's paper there.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.920
So it's all in your head anyway.

07:33.920 --> 07:38.960
So like, I guess it's just that you're getting like poop particles from the air up on it,

07:38.960 --> 07:39.840
up on your hands.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.400
And if that's the case, then your whole body is contaminated.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.120
That's... I mean, that's a fair point.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.160
We're all contaminated.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.680
Honestly, your immune system could do well to get some...

07:49.680 --> 07:52.880
So, hold on.

07:52.880 --> 07:59.360
I'm sorry, Justin, but Griffin, are you saying that you don't believe hand washing in any way helps?

08:00.240 --> 08:04.960
I'm saying... I'm saying you go to a different country.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.960
Throw a dartboard at it.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.000
Throw a whole dartboard at a map.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.760
Throw a dartboard at the wall.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.360
Okay, and then get a dart.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.920
And then leave their house because you will be asked to leave their house.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.440
Throw a dart at a map.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.880
Flip a pool table.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.920
And chances are, whatever country it lands in, they don't even bother.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.840
It's just not a cultural thing for them.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.880
And so you're saying that any other country other than America

08:26.880 --> 08:30.000
not only doesn't wash their hands, but it's far healthier than America?

08:30.000 --> 08:30.560
There's a few.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.520
Greenland washes.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.360
Australia.

08:33.920 --> 08:35.120
Well, West Australia washes.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.480
East Australia, they don't give a fuck.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.040
They wash their hands backwards.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.720
The water flows upwards.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.320
Griffin goes to two countries and suddenly he's seeing everything from a global perspective.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.120
I'm just saying you have to... everything is connected, you guys.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.640
The world is getting smaller.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.320
Are you a citizen of the world yet?

08:50.320 --> 08:53.360
I am a citizen of the Northern Hemisphere.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.760
I'm still working on getting my credentials for the Southern Hemisphere.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.760
But really, what do they have for us down there?

08:57.760 --> 08:59.440
That's the... it's the party hemisphere.

08:59.440 --> 08:59.680
Yeah.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.280
I think we probably got all the gold.

09:01.280 --> 09:01.520
Yeah, it's true.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.240
That's all they had.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.800
We got all the gold out of there, so...

09:04.800 --> 09:06.000
Thanks, Cortez.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.880
You're the best.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.960
I don't... I don't know.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.680
What if you just, like, as you were shaking their hand,

09:11.680 --> 09:14.160
you just leaned in and said, it's not pee, don't worry.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.200
You have to say that.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.680
That you're joking, but you do...

09:17.680 --> 09:18.880
I think the pee on my hands are nothing.

09:18.880 --> 09:23.440
If your hands are wet, if their hand, when they pull it away, is wet from your wetness,

09:23.440 --> 09:24.000
guess what?

09:24.000 --> 09:24.960
You gotta bring it up.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.120
Or you just assert your dominance in the situation.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.800
I mean, that is a power move.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.680
Yeah, that's my hand now.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.120
It may or may not be pee.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.880
You may or may not have my pee on there.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.240
How is that?

09:36.240 --> 09:38.880
I'll be able to find that hand later, because I marked it.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.840
No one else better touch that hand.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.880
Somebody give me a UV light, that's mine.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.400
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.960
I'm just saying, either dry your hands or possibly,

09:49.520 --> 09:50.720
as soon as you show up to the party,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.040
as soon as you feel that you have to go to the bathroom,

09:53.600 --> 09:55.360
look around the room in like a panic state,

09:55.360 --> 09:57.760
like, fuck, I've gotta meet everybody real quick.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.000
Assuming you're at a private party,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.640
like, why are you even washing your hands in a private bathroom?

10:04.640 --> 10:07.600
The only reason to wash your hands is because somebody walks in there

10:07.600 --> 10:10.000
who looks kinda judgy, or you know him.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.280
Yeah, or you just gotta turn the water on for like 10 seconds.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.960
You don't have to, don't even bother getting wet.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.320
That's a good thing.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.040
Just turn the water on, somebody will hear you outside.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.320
Count to four.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.000
He's a good, good washer boy.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.400
And then you walk out, and they think you're a good, good washer boy,

10:26.400 --> 10:29.440
and they say, hey, you sound like a great washer.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.480
My name is Dennis.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.720
My name is Dennis.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.080
And then you shake his hand.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.760
He said, oh, you're a good dryer boy too,

10:35.760 --> 10:37.200
because it is bone dry down there.

10:37.200 --> 10:37.920
So dry.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.200
You say, yeah, I've really got pretty much every concept mastered.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.160
It's nice to meet you.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.600
Listen, this may seem forward, but my name is Dennis Gulper,

10:47.600 --> 10:50.480
and I'm the head of the Washing Hands Institute.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.040
And I want to bring you in as the greatest ever.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.080
I think you could be my champion.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.160
But then suddenly you're living a lie.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.160
And they're like, please tell us how you got so bone dry and so clean.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.760
And you're like, uh, buh.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.000
They're trying to study, because it's like impossible.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.760
He promises he washed his hands.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.240
Yeah.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.680
I don't see how he got them.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.960
Why would he lie to me?

11:08.960 --> 11:11.280
A lot of people tell you to sing Row, Row, Row Your Boat to keep track.

11:11.280 --> 11:11.840
That's a lie.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.840
I do the chorus from Hold On.

11:16.800 --> 11:21.280
Just one go of the chorus from Hold On by Wilson Pickett.

11:21.280 --> 11:21.680
Who is it?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.840
It's Wilson Phillips.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.120
I think it's Genius Phillips.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.880
And what people never tell you is when you do it to a certain song,

11:32.880 --> 11:35.680
you have to sing at the top of your lungs so that everyone outside knows

11:35.680 --> 11:37.120
that you're doing it for the right amount of time.

11:37.120 --> 11:37.600
It's good.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.200
It's good at a party to just be like, or how about awake?

11:42.960 --> 11:45.920
Just like total silence and condolence and crying.

11:45.920 --> 11:50.240
And then someday somebody's going to tell you to go around and wash your hands.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.160
Get the germs off there.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.840
Someone's a good washer boy.

11:55.840 --> 12:01.600
If you guys were to guess what percentage wise, if 100% is all.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.360
Yeah, that's typically how it works.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.520
Seems mathematically correct.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.680
It sounds so far.

12:07.680 --> 12:12.560
What percent would you say wash their hands when somebody enters a room

12:12.560 --> 12:16.640
and is in there with them versus wash their hands when they're alone?

12:17.360 --> 12:18.240
100%.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.960
There's a lot of politics that we're going over again here.

12:20.960 --> 12:27.200
Like if it's a bathroom with stalls and then you're in the stall

12:27.200 --> 12:30.320
and someone else comes in and sits in the stall next to you,

12:30.320 --> 12:32.960
but doesn't see your face, you're free to walk out.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.480
Okay.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.920
I'm talking percentages though.

12:36.560 --> 12:40.320
Do you think no one is doing it for their own edificate?

12:40.320 --> 12:43.120
Like, are you guys suggesting that if you are by yourself,

12:43.120 --> 12:44.880
no one is washing their hands in the bathroom?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.080
I don't know.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.280
Since I have tightened up my hand washing habits,

12:49.280 --> 12:51.520
I have found myself getting sick less,

12:51.520 --> 12:53.920
which I think there's some science to that probably.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.880
What I do every time I go to the bathroom,

12:56.880 --> 13:02.160
I wash my hands and then brush my teeth and then comb my hair every time.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.040
Three times.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.720
Travis is an 80 year old man.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.720
And then I hand the towel back to the attendant

13:08.720 --> 13:11.280
and I say thank you so much and I can give him a dollar.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.200
Speaking of the attendant,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.160
I wanted to talk about bathroom attendants for a second.

13:16.160 --> 13:16.480
Okay.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.360
As far as I know, they're only in airports.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.920
Maybe in strip clubs I've seen twice.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.960
And I don't understand why they are in the airport.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.400
And I don't understand why I see shoe shiners in the airport

13:30.400 --> 13:33.280
and only, only there.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.080
So this is my question.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.640
Because we have to have jobs for our poetry majors.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.440
That is very funny, but it doesn't answer my question.

13:41.440 --> 13:45.920
Is the airport, is there another rich person world

13:46.640 --> 13:48.880
that is going on in parallel to ours

13:48.880 --> 13:52.880
that we only have access to at the airport

13:53.440 --> 13:56.080
because I mean, that's why like-

13:56.080 --> 13:59.680
So are you asking like, is the airport a great equalizer?

13:59.680 --> 14:02.000
Where you get a peek into-

14:02.560 --> 14:07.840
Is that the only place where our two sort of realities crossover?

14:08.400 --> 14:11.760
Because just the logistics of building a rich person airport

14:11.760 --> 14:12.800
is just beyond the pale.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.040
Sure.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.360
It is the only place where you see sort of what's going,

14:17.360 --> 14:20.000
like $40 for headphones at Brookstone.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.720
Sure.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.680
Chili's to go.

14:21.680 --> 14:22.880
I've got an alternate theory

14:22.880 --> 14:26.880
and it is from my time in my recent time in Germany,

14:26.880 --> 14:29.840
every single restaurant, every single one,

14:29.840 --> 14:31.120
every single place we went to,

14:31.120 --> 14:32.800
their bathroom had an attendant

14:34.000 --> 14:36.480
and they sat outside between the men and women's room

14:36.480 --> 14:40.160
and would offer you toiletries or anything that you wanted.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.600
So my theory is they're all German immigrants

14:43.600 --> 14:46.000
who came to America with stars in their eyes

14:46.000 --> 14:47.440
and then they just kind of got to the airport

14:47.440 --> 14:48.400
and they're like, ah, fuck it.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.440
This is fine.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.800
This is fine.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.640
I've always wanted to like when I was at a restaurant

14:52.640 --> 14:54.240
because I've been to several restaurants

14:54.240 --> 14:56.080
that had a bathroom attendant.

14:56.080 --> 14:56.960
I know.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.760
Count it.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.120
And I've always, I've been to several restaurants.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.840
I was hoping you were going to stop there.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.440
And every time I've seen an attendant,

15:03.440 --> 15:04.960
I've always wanted to walk up to like,

15:04.960 --> 15:08.000
you know, the maitre d' or the host or somebody and be like,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.920
hey, a bathroom attendant was really nice

15:09.920 --> 15:11.840
and have them go bathroom attendant.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.240
Yeah.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.600
What are you, oh no.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.720
We had a bathroom attendant,

15:14.720 --> 15:17.840
but he's been dead for 15 years.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.480
Ghost poop face.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.120
Okay.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.240
Well, that's the end of the bit.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.800
Can you edit that part out?

15:24.800 --> 15:25.280
No, I can't.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.600
I was hoping something funnier would come after face.

15:27.600 --> 15:27.920
Okay.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.160
I'm going to remember to do that,

15:30.160 --> 15:32.880
but there might be a dog outside or something

15:32.880 --> 15:33.680
while I'm editing.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.840
So it's okay.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.640
Don't worry about it.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.440
You want a yahoo?

15:39.440 --> 15:40.320
Give me a yahoo.

15:40.320 --> 15:40.960
That feel better?

15:42.080 --> 15:42.880
Ghost peeper?

15:43.520 --> 15:43.760
Nope.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.160
That's what I was hoping I would say.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.480
Yeah, it's not, it's not much better.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.320
Here's a, let's just go.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.360
This one was sent in by, by Slimer.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.400
That's how Slimer was born.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.280
Thank you.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.720
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.360
Thank you, Krista.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.840
It's by yahoo answers user Kevin who asks,

16:05.520 --> 16:09.440
if your celebrity crush says he or she will go out with you

16:09.440 --> 16:13.600
if you eat just a little bit of his or her poop,

16:13.600 --> 16:14.240
would you do it?

16:14.240 --> 16:20.720
Oh God.

16:26.240 --> 16:26.800
Yes.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.040
Yes.

16:29.600 --> 16:29.840
No.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.520
Can you reread the question?

16:33.520 --> 16:36.640
If your celebrity crush says he or she will go out with you

16:36.640 --> 16:36.880
if-

16:36.880 --> 16:37.520
Stop right there.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.080
Stop right there.

16:38.080 --> 16:38.320
Okay.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.640
Go out with you?

16:40.640 --> 16:45.120
Listen, if you're talking about an ongoing relationship with my celebrity crush,

16:45.120 --> 16:48.320
this isn't just a one-off situation, okay?

16:48.320 --> 16:51.920
Anybody who begins the tenor of the relationship with,

16:51.920 --> 16:53.280
just eat a little bit of my poop.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.560
So how did you guys meet?

16:54.560 --> 16:55.200
Well, funny story.

16:55.200 --> 16:55.840
How did you guys meet?

16:55.840 --> 16:56.400
It's a terrible-

16:56.400 --> 17:01.120
What if that's, what if that's how I met your mother ends?

17:01.120 --> 17:16.000
That whole time is the last shot of the show.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.080
Is the two kids on the couch horrifying?

17:18.080 --> 17:21.520
Yeah, the series finale, the episode is 30 seconds long

17:21.520 --> 17:24.400
and Bob Saget's like, all right, here it comes.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.280
Are you ready?

17:25.280 --> 17:26.640
It's Penelope Cruz.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.400
And she said, how do you feel about scat?

17:28.400 --> 17:29.360
And I said, not great.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.000
She said, well, tough, and then I ate just a little bit.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.040
The end.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.480
And then the camera pans around and Bob Saget is wearing a ball gag

17:36.480 --> 17:37.600
or he's in chains.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.920
Any other questions?

17:39.920 --> 17:43.280
Now get out of here so your mom can poop on me.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.680
And that is the story.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.120
Now your mom says her little whore has done enough storytelling.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.680
It's time to get upstairs and do my whore job.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.520
Like a good little slut that I am, the dad from How I Met Your Mother.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.240
I have to go.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.240
Oh God.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.040
Oh God.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.160
Oh shit, that'd be great.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.520
Those kids would be so angry.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.280
Like we've been sitting here for seven years.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.360
And that's how it ends?

18:05.360 --> 18:06.480
The end of it is you eat a little bit of poop?

18:06.480 --> 18:08.720
And he just looks and it goes, the aristocrats.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.280
Yeah.

18:09.280 --> 18:09.680
Really?

18:11.360 --> 18:13.520
So you think it might be a celebrity mother?

18:14.880 --> 18:17.360
And that's how I met your mother, Geena Davis.

18:19.280 --> 18:25.760
Known archer and scat enthusiast and star of Cutthroat Island, Geena Davis.

18:25.760 --> 18:30.800
Earth girls may be easy, but earth boys will eat your poopy.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.720
It's science.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.480
I also feel like this revealed too much

18:38.480 --> 18:40.960
and letting people know that my celebrity crush is Geena Davis.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.320
Now Geena Davis or earth girls are easy era Geena Davis?

18:46.320 --> 18:48.560
Commander in chief, Geena Davis.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.760
Like 1988 circa, Geena Davis.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.480
Sure.

18:52.480 --> 18:56.000
But also circa 1988, Annie McDowell.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.520
Oh my God, yes.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.040
I got some weird standards.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.240
And it includes time travel.

19:02.240 --> 19:02.640
I guess.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.200
And being eight.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.520
I don't want to talk about it.

19:08.240 --> 19:14.000
There isn't, we're not equipped to, we're all in very happy relationships.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.000
I feel like if this question was to hang out with a celebrity

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
you think you'd be best friends with.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.320
Would you eat a little bit of Alton Brown's poopy?

19:24.320 --> 19:25.680
Just to like hang out with him.

19:25.680 --> 19:26.160
Yes.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.600
Have you seen how well he eats?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.800
Yeah, he would prepare it.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.080
He got way healthy.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.080
Yeah, I was saying like, if you said like,

19:34.080 --> 19:36.880
eat a little bit of David Tennant's poop, all over it.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.560
Can we not have this conversation at all?

19:38.560 --> 19:41.040
Travis would probably eat a little bit of David Tennant's poop

19:41.040 --> 19:42.640
even if it meant not hanging.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.280
Just cause.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.200
Like just showed up in a FedEx box.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.640
Even if I just ran into a dude on the street and luncheon

19:48.640 --> 19:50.880
who said, hey, you want a bit of David Tennant's poop?

19:50.880 --> 19:52.400
I would ask the price.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.600
Can this not happen?

19:53.600 --> 19:57.280
Let me just ask, listen, I know you want to get off the subject

19:57.280 --> 19:59.040
but I have like 75 more questions.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.040
Do you think there are people out there,

20:01.040 --> 20:04.000
and I really, I don't fancy myself a celebrity,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.760
but do you think there are people out there

20:05.760 --> 20:08.400
who would eat a little bit of our poop just to hang out with us?

20:09.440 --> 20:09.940
Yeah.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.920
I really hope not.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.360
Like I super, super, super hope not.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.640
Okay, let me rephrase.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.960
I bet there are people out there that would just eat our poop.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.840
I don't think it has anything to do with hanging out with us.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.880
We're not Tennant level, but I think we have a little bit-

20:26.880 --> 20:27.280
No, no, no.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.040
I'm saying just because I think there are people out there

20:29.040 --> 20:30.080
that like to eat poop.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.360
Oh, sure, sure.

20:31.360 --> 20:31.860
Okay.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.480
Guys, everything that's happening right now

20:34.480 --> 20:36.000
is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

20:36.000 --> 20:36.500
Okay.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.720
Justin, there's not a single celebrity

20:38.720 --> 20:40.640
whose poop you would eat to hang out with them?

20:40.640 --> 20:43.280
There is not a single person whose poop-

20:43.280 --> 20:44.480
Antonio Banderas.

20:45.040 --> 20:45.540
Okay.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.340
You got me.

20:47.120 --> 20:47.620
Shit.

20:47.620 --> 20:51.220
You got a cut to the core of me, Travis.

20:52.820 --> 20:53.780
Let's, yeah, we gotta go.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.100
I need to talk about like something like humans talk about.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.500
I need to take like a big gulp of water and just-

20:58.500 --> 20:59.000
Ugh.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.020
Ugh.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.060
Not a big gulp.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.660
I hate this stupid podcast.

21:02.660 --> 21:07.780
I just moved into an apartment for the new semester of my college year.

21:08.340 --> 21:11.060
While my room looks good, I have an issue.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.740
There is nothing on my walls.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.300
I thought this wouldn't be an issue,

21:15.300 --> 21:17.300
but staring at the void of nothing surrounding me

21:17.300 --> 21:18.660
is starting to make me edgy.

21:18.660 --> 21:20.580
So what should I put up there?

21:20.580 --> 21:22.740
That's from Good Idealists in Georgia.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.940
If you came to my brother, my brother and me live show,

21:25.940 --> 21:28.900
you could buy a hip poster to put up there.

21:28.900 --> 21:29.400
Yeah.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.860
How about a poster featuring Antonio Banderas?

21:31.860 --> 21:32.260
Yeah.

21:32.260 --> 21:32.980
Well.

21:32.980 --> 21:34.180
Star of stage and screen.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.940
Concert posters are good.

21:37.940 --> 21:40.340
God, did we really just make the jump from

21:41.700 --> 21:45.140
scat cooking to interior design?

21:45.140 --> 21:46.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.180
We never said it was cooked poop.

21:48.180 --> 21:48.680
Sorry.

21:50.580 --> 21:51.540
Yeah, concert poster.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.940
Anything that you can have a story for.

21:53.940 --> 21:54.900
Those are always fun.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.260
You know what I've always wanted to do?

21:58.260 --> 21:59.220
What's that, Travis?

21:59.220 --> 22:00.020
And I don't know.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.060
Like, it would depend on-

22:01.060 --> 22:03.460
Can I guess Gina Davis's poop?

22:03.460 --> 22:05.300
No, I haven't always wanted to do that.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.860
Not until I saw Earth, Girls, or Easy.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.540
No, like to have a bare wall and it would depend on your lease,

22:11.540 --> 22:14.820
but to like draw or paint like your own mural or something,

22:14.820 --> 22:16.420
and then you probably have to paint over it.

22:16.420 --> 22:16.660
Sure.

22:16.660 --> 22:17.620
That's going to look real good.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.500
I mean, if you're artsy in any way.

22:20.500 --> 22:20.900
No, no, no.

22:20.900 --> 22:21.460
I know.

22:21.460 --> 22:22.900
I'm saying I've seen your watercolors.

22:24.340 --> 22:26.580
I can actually draw and paint very well, Griffin.

22:26.580 --> 22:26.900
I know.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.900
I'm saying I've seen your watercolors.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.740
Because it sounds insincere.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.980
You're not coming across as a sincere person.

22:32.980 --> 22:33.940
Can I try again?

22:33.940 --> 22:35.540
Oh, I've seen your watercolors.

22:35.540 --> 22:35.940
No, fuck.

22:35.940 --> 22:36.900
Not helping.

22:36.900 --> 22:37.860
That's going the wrong way.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.580
I've seen your watercolors.

22:40.580 --> 22:41.860
Nah, that's better.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.340
Okay.

22:42.340 --> 22:43.460
Well, it's like Michael Manny.

22:43.460 --> 22:44.980
Do you remember his bedroom when he was a kid?

22:44.980 --> 22:45.140
Sure, sure.

22:45.140 --> 22:46.260
And it was just like on the wall.

22:46.260 --> 22:47.780
His parents would let him just like draw.

22:47.780 --> 22:48.580
Illustrator.

22:48.580 --> 22:52.180
Illustrator of the My Brother, My Brother, and Me comic book origin story.

22:52.180 --> 22:54.180
Now, the difference is that he is very good.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.220
Yeah, but he was eight at the time.

22:57.220 --> 22:59.780
Like, I'm saying if mom and dad let me draw on the wall when I was eight,

22:59.780 --> 23:02.260
maybe I would be a very talented illustrator.

23:02.260 --> 23:04.100
If mom and dad had let me drive a car at eight years old,

23:04.100 --> 23:05.540
I would be a NASCAR driver right now.

23:06.340 --> 23:07.300
I'm saying.

23:07.300 --> 23:08.180
Is that the way it works?

23:08.180 --> 23:09.140
That is basically it.

23:09.140 --> 23:09.540
Yeah.

23:09.540 --> 23:13.780
Eight is basically the cutoff for any career aspiration.

23:13.780 --> 23:17.620
Just like Travis stopped aspiring to make love to women at the age of five.

23:17.620 --> 23:17.860
Yeah.

23:18.740 --> 23:19.460
Apparently.

23:19.460 --> 23:20.420
It's frozen in time.

23:20.420 --> 23:21.380
Yeah, it is.

23:21.380 --> 23:22.420
In sexual amber.

23:25.140 --> 23:28.420
After I met my five-year-old girlfriend, sexual amber.

23:28.420 --> 23:28.740
Yeah.

23:28.740 --> 23:28.980
Yeah.

23:31.060 --> 23:31.940
I'm bad about that.

23:31.940 --> 23:34.580
I don't think, in my apartment in Chicago,

23:34.580 --> 23:36.180
my walls were completely bare in my bedroom.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.300
And it was depressing.

23:37.300 --> 23:38.500
It was like sleeping in a jail cell.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.780
So you got to have something.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.380
Don't go just like posters just like taped up bare.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.540
If you don't put your fucking posters in a frame,

23:47.540 --> 23:48.900
hang up this podcast.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.500
You don't deserve to hear the words from our mouths

23:52.500 --> 23:53.540
because you're a caveman.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.700
I'm just going to use sticky tack.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.780
Oh, that's going to look really great on the walls.

23:57.780 --> 24:00.020
Oh, and the poster will be real bumpy afterwards.

24:00.020 --> 24:00.740
Good.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.700
I love it.

24:01.700 --> 24:02.580
And probably rip.

24:03.380 --> 24:05.220
What do you guys have hanging right now?

24:05.220 --> 24:06.340
What's surrounding you right now?

24:06.340 --> 24:06.660
Right now?

24:06.660 --> 24:07.460
In the room.

24:07.460 --> 24:07.700
Sorry.

24:07.700 --> 24:08.980
In the room you're in. I'm going to start with Travis.

24:08.980 --> 24:09.460
Okay.

24:09.460 --> 24:10.180
Okay, great.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.100
I'm sitting in my living room.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.100
I've got lots of pictures of friends and family on the walls.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.060
Why are you in the living room?

24:17.620 --> 24:18.820
Because this is where I record, man.

24:18.820 --> 24:19.620
It's where I live.

24:19.620 --> 24:19.940
Okay.

24:19.940 --> 24:20.180
Sorry.

24:20.180 --> 24:20.820
Go ahead.

24:20.820 --> 24:24.100
And I've got a painting that Teresa's sister did that's lovely.

24:25.540 --> 24:27.460
A welcome sign from our old house.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.060
And some shelves with candles on them.

24:30.340 --> 24:32.180
Shelves is a fucking great way to go.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.940
Get like standalone shelves.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.260
You put all kinds of shit on there.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.260
Man, what can't you put on a shelf?

24:38.260 --> 24:40.180
You can put anything on a shelf.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.380
That is our new-

24:41.380 --> 24:42.900
My brother and my brother and me.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.660
Shelves is fucking great.

24:44.660 --> 24:45.700
Travis McElroy.

24:47.700 --> 24:48.980
These shelves damn nice.

24:51.140 --> 24:54.580
When we put our shelves up, it changed the way our house looks.

24:55.220 --> 24:59.060
Knives, shot glasses, butter dishes.

24:59.060 --> 25:02.580
Little like skulls with candles on them.

25:02.580 --> 25:03.780
You know, just whatever.

25:03.780 --> 25:04.500
Masking tape.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.020
Dead animals.

25:06.020 --> 25:06.980
Tar pics.

25:06.980 --> 25:07.540
Everything.

25:07.540 --> 25:08.180
Everything goes up there.

25:08.180 --> 25:09.140
I've got a little-

25:09.140 --> 25:12.580
I've got my Harvey Danger poster from the concert we went to in Chicago.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.580
Their next to last performance.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.580
I've got a life well wasted poster.

25:17.300 --> 25:21.540
And I've got one of those little height meters to show how much I've grown.

25:24.980 --> 25:26.020
That's my special boy.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.460
A lot of people think it's weird.

25:28.820 --> 25:31.460
A lot of people think it's weird to do that to yourself.

25:31.460 --> 25:37.380
For yourself when you move to a new apartment every single year since you were 19 years old.

25:37.380 --> 25:42.340
But I want to know just how my bones are doing.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.860
How my skeleton's doing.

25:43.860 --> 25:44.260
You know?

25:44.260 --> 25:47.940
Okay, so you're keeping track of how much you're shrinking year to year.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.900
No, it's pretty much plateaued.

25:52.260 --> 25:55.540
So it's really just one line that I keep drawing over and over again.

25:55.540 --> 25:58.020
Also I should mention in different apartments every single year.

25:58.020 --> 25:59.220
That part's important.

25:59.220 --> 26:02.660
Right now I have no metric to measure against, I guess.

26:03.460 --> 26:04.900
It's just nice for people to know.

26:04.900 --> 26:08.820
Because maybe I'm getting robbed and they start in my office, which is where it is.

26:08.820 --> 26:10.260
And then they go into the office and say,

26:10.260 --> 26:11.860
Oh shit, this guy's five foot ten.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.700
Let's get the fuck out of here.

26:13.700 --> 26:14.020
You know?

26:14.020 --> 26:15.140
You know what you should do?

26:15.140 --> 26:15.540
What's that?

26:15.540 --> 26:16.980
Take it one step further.

26:16.980 --> 26:17.300
Okay.

26:17.300 --> 26:20.660
And have somebody outline you on the wall.

26:20.660 --> 26:21.460
Oh, that's fun.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.740
And then just keep outlining you to see if you're getting fatter.

26:24.740 --> 26:32.020
Somebody, the last person who owned my home measured their daughter's height on the inside

26:32.020 --> 26:33.380
of my kitchen cupboard.

26:33.380 --> 26:34.500
I discovered that.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.500
Why do they keep their daughter in the cupboard?

26:39.460 --> 26:40.740
It was just written on there.

26:40.740 --> 26:42.260
Oh, yeah.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.020
Hey, so in my room, there's a...

26:47.940 --> 26:49.380
This is going to take a half hour.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.460
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

26:51.460 --> 26:52.020
It's boring.

26:52.020 --> 26:52.500
Yeah.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.860
I don't want to talk about this anymore. It's boring.

26:53.860 --> 26:54.100
Yeah.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.420
I recently started a new job, but I got a problem.

26:58.420 --> 27:02.420
My manager burps constantly, never excuses himself.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.500
He mentioned once that he burps when he is hungry,

27:05.620 --> 27:07.380
but that would mean he's hungry all the time.

27:08.340 --> 27:10.180
The other day, your boss is Yogi Bear.

27:10.180 --> 27:14.100
The other day, I think he burped in front of a customer and didn't say anything.

27:14.660 --> 27:16.740
Also, these are not little burps.

27:16.740 --> 27:17.940
Should I say something to him?

27:17.940 --> 27:18.980
If so, what should I say?

27:18.980 --> 27:21.700
Hey, is this just a guy trying the...

27:23.620 --> 27:27.220
Is this just a guy thing that girls just have to deal with?

27:27.220 --> 27:31.540
I was bullied by a burper in elementary school, so maybe I'm more sensitive to burps.

27:31.540 --> 27:32.420
Please help me out.

27:32.980 --> 27:35.540
Grossed out in Greenwich, who works for Travis.

27:35.540 --> 27:36.340
I'm pretty sure it's Greenwich.

27:36.340 --> 27:38.180
No, Greenwich.

27:38.180 --> 27:39.620
I don't know why I said Greenwich.

27:39.620 --> 27:40.340
I'm so sorry.

27:40.980 --> 27:42.580
You edited that, so I said it.

27:42.580 --> 27:43.300
Oh, a dog.

27:43.300 --> 27:46.180
A, burps are completely natural.

27:46.180 --> 27:46.820
Travis burps.

27:46.820 --> 27:48.900
B, this gentleman needs to learn to excuse himself.

27:48.900 --> 27:49.620
Travis burps.

27:49.620 --> 27:53.380
Did you say, egg burps are completely natural?

27:53.380 --> 27:57.780
Because I'm here to tell you, egg burps are the pits if they are the most unnatural thing.

27:57.780 --> 27:59.140
I said the letter A.

27:59.140 --> 28:02.180
Okay, it sounded like egg, so are you hungry right now?

28:02.180 --> 28:03.300
Is that a burp?

28:03.300 --> 28:04.660
I actually am very hungry.

28:04.660 --> 28:05.780
I have not eaten all day.

28:05.780 --> 28:06.260
Okay.

28:06.260 --> 28:09.540
The first time God smelled an egg burp, he was like, I did not make that.

28:09.540 --> 28:10.820
That one sounded like egg burp.

28:10.820 --> 28:11.380
I'm hungry.

28:11.380 --> 28:14.020
I did not make that, I blew it.

28:14.020 --> 28:16.100
This is not of my creation.

28:16.100 --> 28:17.060
That one's on seitan.

28:17.700 --> 28:18.580
That was a seitan burp.

28:18.580 --> 28:21.620
I have not eaten in the last three days to avoid burping.

28:21.620 --> 28:22.500
I'm trying to cut back.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.300
I appreciate that.

28:23.940 --> 28:25.300
No, Travis burps a lot.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.740
Travis has the dyspepsia.

28:27.620 --> 28:28.580
I have a disease.

28:28.580 --> 28:29.140
You have a disease.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.300
He tries to blame it on a disease, but it's really just rude.

28:31.300 --> 28:31.860
I don't know what the-

28:31.860 --> 28:33.220
It's not rude.

28:33.220 --> 28:37.540
The disease doesn't make you open your fucking mouth when you burp like you do.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.620
If I don't burp, I'll vomit.

28:39.620 --> 28:44.100
The disease doesn't make you go to the trophy store and buy one every time.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.100
I'm just saying.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.100
I had one once that was like three minutes long.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.500
It sounded like a demon was coming out of me and it was epic.

28:50.500 --> 28:50.900
That's fine, but-

28:50.900 --> 28:53.860
How does the disease prevent you from covering your goddamn mouth every time?

28:53.860 --> 28:54.820
Or not buying a t-shirt.

28:54.820 --> 28:55.940
Because I'm not a child.

28:55.940 --> 28:58.500
I'll burp when I want to in my own goddamn house.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.820
But you're often not in your house.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.020
I'll burp in your house.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.700
I'll burp in anyone's house.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.100
I would not, could not in a house.

29:06.100 --> 29:11.460
One time I actually heard Travis burp out the words Cincinnati King of Burps, which-

29:13.300 --> 29:15.940
To be fair, that was during a job interview and I nailed it.

29:19.940 --> 29:21.300
And now I'm this person's boss.

29:23.380 --> 29:24.660
So I'm climbing up the ladder.

29:25.300 --> 29:26.260
I'm afraid I might have-

29:27.700 --> 29:30.100
This past year, I've been burping a lot.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.580
And it's really not from a place of pride like Travis.

29:32.580 --> 29:34.020
I'm deeply ashamed every time I do it.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.620
And I live with my girlfriend now.

29:35.620 --> 29:36.980
So she has to like-

29:36.980 --> 29:38.100
I always try to be dainty about it.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.460
So that's a sin trying to come out.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.220
I try to be dainty, probably.

29:41.220 --> 29:44.500
I try to be dainty about it, but there's just nothing doing.

29:44.500 --> 29:48.020
And I always feel this need to just apologize profusely every time it happens.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.700
You should just hide it behind a lace fan.

29:51.220 --> 29:54.340
Put your gloved hand to the back of your hand, to your mouth.

29:55.140 --> 29:56.180
And hide it.

29:56.180 --> 29:58.660
Because apparently you're a Victorian person.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.260
Just burp like an American.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.820
I faint every time too, which is nice.

30:02.820 --> 30:05.060
Ah, that's the vapors.

30:05.780 --> 30:07.620
No, it's horrible.

30:07.620 --> 30:08.260
It's disgusting.

30:08.260 --> 30:09.460
You're farting with your mouth.

30:09.460 --> 30:10.340
And like you wouldn't-

30:11.620 --> 30:13.380
In all seriousness, you should not-

30:13.380 --> 30:17.300
Like this dude is wrong burping at a professional workplace

30:17.300 --> 30:19.140
in front of customers as your boss.

30:19.140 --> 30:20.900
Like don't get me wrong.

30:20.900 --> 30:24.100
I celebrate my burps at home with friends where it's safe.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.300
It's not, but go on.

30:26.100 --> 30:29.780
But I'm saying, I think that you're perfectly in the right

30:29.780 --> 30:32.900
to the next time he does it, be like, hey Chet, cut it out.

30:32.900 --> 30:36.020
You realize that like when I'm like staying over at your house

30:36.020 --> 30:38.580
on a trip or something like that and you burp,

30:39.300 --> 30:41.220
the first thing I don't think is,

30:42.100 --> 30:45.460
oh, this is a really safe environment for me to be in.

30:47.140 --> 30:49.380
You don't think, well, I'm a guest in his house.

30:50.420 --> 30:52.820
No, I think, are you fucking kidding me?

30:52.820 --> 30:54.580
I'm holding a burp right now, you guys,

30:54.580 --> 30:56.580
because I love you and I love our listeners.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.740
When I know Griffin's coming to my house,

30:58.740 --> 31:01.860
I turn on a nice scentsy.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.220
I'll maybe select a scent cake to put in,

31:05.220 --> 31:06.740
something I know he'll enjoy.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.260
When Griffin goes to Travis's house,

31:08.260 --> 31:10.900
Travis just burps in his face and shouts dominance.

31:10.900 --> 31:13.780
Listen, I will not be bullied, all right?

31:14.500 --> 31:16.660
Burp as you might, stand up.

31:16.660 --> 31:19.060
I think it's an old fashioned,

31:19.060 --> 31:20.340
you might as well be telling me about

31:20.340 --> 31:22.900
how you're gonna get a phosphate down the soda fountain

31:24.420 --> 31:26.900
and then pin a girl and go steady.

31:26.900 --> 31:29.140
We're adults, it's 2012.

31:29.140 --> 31:31.300
Burp if you want to, it shouldn't be offensive.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.940
It's an archaic rule.

31:35.940 --> 31:37.140
How does it upset anyone?

31:37.140 --> 31:40.100
You burp so hard once my beer fell over.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.500
How does it affect anyone

31:42.500 --> 31:44.660
other than being children and giggling at it

31:44.660 --> 31:45.620
because it's burping?

31:45.620 --> 31:48.340
Because it smells like all the food you've eaten.

31:48.340 --> 31:52.020
Burp loud, burp proud.

31:52.020 --> 31:53.540
How far do you extend this?

31:53.540 --> 31:56.580
Like do you shit in your hands and throw it at people?

31:56.580 --> 31:58.180
No, of course not.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.700
Gobble that up, pretend I'm Geena Davis.

32:00.900 --> 32:01.860
No, because that has,

32:01.860 --> 32:03.940
I also don't burp in people's faces.

32:03.940 --> 32:05.620
I don't sneak up behind them while they're napping

32:05.620 --> 32:07.620
and burping their ears as loud as I can.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.140
So that would be hilarious.

32:09.140 --> 32:12.260
You would excuse yourself to the corner to defecate it.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.940
Like some sort of beast.

32:13.940 --> 32:15.380
Is that what you're saying to me?

32:15.380 --> 32:17.620
Listen, one step at a time.

32:17.620 --> 32:20.180
Travis, some of us are trying to live in a society.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.300
Right, over here.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.380
Yeah, and I'm trying to make this society safer

32:23.380 --> 32:24.740
with people with my disease.

32:24.740 --> 32:28.900
You're saying, you're saying when you make it sound

32:29.700 --> 32:32.020
like you're throwing up invisible vomit,

32:33.060 --> 32:35.620
it's because it's for a fucking cause?

32:36.900 --> 32:37.860
You're making a point?

32:38.900 --> 32:41.380
Well, no, it's because I enjoy burping.

32:41.380 --> 32:43.940
It's the, Travis is on the march of Grimes.

32:49.940 --> 32:51.940
Oh man.

32:51.940 --> 32:52.740
You are horrible.

32:53.300 --> 32:53.860
Eat better.

32:53.860 --> 32:55.220
Yeah, dude.

32:55.220 --> 32:55.860
Just eat better.

32:55.860 --> 32:57.940
Just treat yourself better food-wise.

32:57.940 --> 32:58.740
Are you me?

32:58.740 --> 32:59.060
Yeah.

32:59.700 --> 33:00.260
Okay.

33:00.260 --> 33:01.940
Do you know what's gonna help you

33:01.940 --> 33:03.940
afford all the organic free range stuff that you need

33:03.940 --> 33:06.260
to keep your tummy gurgles under control?

33:06.900 --> 33:07.380
What's that?

33:08.580 --> 33:09.620
The money zone.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.460
I got this message.

33:21.460 --> 33:23.460
It's from...

33:23.460 --> 33:24.500
Urgent message, sir.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.460
Urgent message for Across the Wires from boyfriend Dan.

33:27.460 --> 33:29.140
This one's going out to Becky.

33:29.780 --> 33:30.740
He says, happy birthday Becky.

33:30.740 --> 33:32.420
Here's a slow jam for Becky.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.100
Here's a slow jam for Becky.

33:34.660 --> 33:36.820
I'll make love to you, my boys to men.

33:37.380 --> 33:40.580
So you got me hooked on my bim-bim from the first time we talk.

33:40.580 --> 33:43.060
So I figured there's no better way to wish you a happy birthday

33:43.060 --> 33:45.780
than a shout out from the McElroy brothers.

33:45.780 --> 33:48.260
The last three months have been the best ever

33:48.260 --> 33:49.700
and I've got to, got to, got to.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.460
You get the idea.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.460
He says, and here's to more ahead.

33:53.460 --> 33:54.420
Love you.

33:54.420 --> 33:55.300
They're in love.

33:55.300 --> 33:55.940
You get it.

33:55.940 --> 33:56.740
Blah, blah, blah.

33:57.620 --> 33:58.820
Listen, listen, listen.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.660
Either you're in love and you feel intimidated

34:00.660 --> 34:02.180
or you're not in love and you feel lonely.

34:02.180 --> 34:02.820
Nobody needs to get in love.

34:02.820 --> 34:06.820
How did we, how did we serve as the inception of a romance?

34:06.820 --> 34:07.780
How did, how did that?

34:08.420 --> 34:09.540
I don't want to know.

34:09.540 --> 34:10.020
I don't know.

34:10.020 --> 34:10.180
Yeah.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.260
I don't know how you connect it to, you know,

34:12.260 --> 34:15.540
there's this great show with three real ass brothers

34:15.540 --> 34:18.180
talking about eating celebrity defecation.

34:18.180 --> 34:20.100
Do you want to go out again or what's up?

34:20.900 --> 34:22.260
Are we, am I good?

34:22.260 --> 34:23.620
To be fair, I want to make it clear

34:23.620 --> 34:26.740
that we're not talking about eating their poop recreationally.

34:26.740 --> 34:28.740
I can't talk about it again.

34:28.740 --> 34:29.220
I'm sorry.

34:29.220 --> 34:30.740
I keep bringing it up.

34:30.740 --> 34:33.380
It's like a scab that I can't pick at, but I can't eat.

34:33.380 --> 34:35.140
Thank you, Billy Crystal, for your scab.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.020
Scott Braggen.

34:40.740 --> 34:42.020
This is from Britty.

34:42.660 --> 34:43.940
This is the message.

34:43.940 --> 34:45.060
Travis, read it.

34:45.060 --> 34:48.340
Scott is turning 26, he's an amazing drummer,

34:48.340 --> 34:51.220
but also incredibly multi-talented.

34:51.220 --> 34:54.900
He has mad art skills and is returning to school to get his BFA.

34:54.900 --> 34:59.300
He skydives on the weekends and his fourth cue in Aikido.

34:59.300 --> 35:02.260
But first and foremost, Scott is one of my closest friends

35:02.260 --> 35:04.100
and it's very fun to be around.

35:04.100 --> 35:04.740
Lots of love.

35:05.860 --> 35:06.660
Well, that's nice.

35:06.660 --> 35:11.300
I'm glad you guys are our pals and, and Scott.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.460
I'm glad that Scott is doing sky Aikido.

35:13.460 --> 35:17.220
And Scott kind of makes me feel a little self-conscious, honestly.

35:17.220 --> 35:18.260
There's doing a lot of...

35:18.260 --> 35:19.460
He's doing too much?

35:19.460 --> 35:21.220
You got a lot going on, you know?

35:21.220 --> 35:22.580
I don't really enjoy that.

35:23.380 --> 35:26.260
Scott, you should stop drumming.

35:26.260 --> 35:29.620
Stop drumming and maybe with the martial arts.

35:29.620 --> 35:30.260
I want to feel better.

35:30.260 --> 35:30.980
Just get cut back.

35:30.980 --> 35:32.420
Go to like second cue.

35:32.420 --> 35:32.660
Yeah.

35:33.460 --> 35:37.620
There's one way for me and Scott to settle who's the best.

35:37.620 --> 35:38.580
By the way, it's Scott.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.140
And we're going to play Outlast.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.500
Now here's Outlast.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.060
I talked with Thomas who built Outlast

35:45.940 --> 35:49.700
and it is my new favorite idea for a iPhone game.

35:49.700 --> 35:53.140
So you guys know, you guys know hands on a hard body?

35:53.140 --> 35:54.180
You know that idea where it's a...

35:54.180 --> 35:54.740
Go on.

35:56.500 --> 35:57.060
Oh yeah.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.460
Do tell.

35:59.460 --> 36:01.860
Where a bunch of people put their hands on a truck or car.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.140
Oh yeah.

36:03.140 --> 36:05.540
And then the car drives off and then...

36:05.540 --> 36:07.700
The car drives off and they're like, wait, my hand!

36:07.700 --> 36:09.620
No, the last person to leave their hand out with.

36:09.620 --> 36:11.780
So Outlast is a game like that.

36:11.780 --> 36:14.820
It splits your iPhone screen into a red half and a blue half.

36:15.380 --> 36:19.060
Both people put a finger or thumb on the screen on their half

36:19.060 --> 36:20.260
and then the game starts.

36:20.260 --> 36:24.340
And the game is only who leaves their finger or thumb on the longest.

36:25.060 --> 36:26.900
If you try to jostle it, you both lose.

36:27.860 --> 36:28.180
Now I know...

36:28.180 --> 36:30.660
So you could like do it and then like burp in their face.

36:30.660 --> 36:33.140
Burp in their face and they're like, oh, I gotta get out of here.

36:33.140 --> 36:34.980
And if they leave it, take it off, they'll lose.

36:34.980 --> 36:36.820
Now here's where it gets really fantastic.

36:38.020 --> 36:38.500
If they...

36:38.500 --> 36:43.220
If they... before the game starts, each person logs into their Twitter account.

36:43.220 --> 36:44.420
If they have Twitter.

36:44.420 --> 36:49.620
Each person logs into their Twitter account and writes a tweet for the other person.

36:49.620 --> 36:53.700
And if that person loses, that tweet is instantly deployed.

36:53.700 --> 36:54.100
With no...

36:54.100 --> 36:55.220
Oh, shit.

36:56.020 --> 36:56.500
Right.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.500
So Griffin wants to lose Twitter account.

36:58.500 --> 37:02.820
I log into mine and then I write something that Griffin will tweet if he loses.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.900
Like can't wait to eat Gina Davis's poop.

37:04.900 --> 37:05.140
Yeah.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.180
Yeah, something like that.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.900
Spoiler alert, we're both writing that.

37:09.700 --> 37:09.940
Yeah.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.740
So yeah, and you...

37:12.740 --> 37:15.220
Or you can, you know, you can play for whatever stakes you want.

37:15.220 --> 37:19.700
But I think the idea of Twitter stakes are pretty fantastic.

37:19.700 --> 37:21.940
You can get it on the App Store to search for Outlast.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.180
It's 99 cents.

37:24.180 --> 37:27.620
But what I would also recommend is that you follow CantOutlast on Twitter.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.540
Because it retweets messages from people who lost the game.

37:31.540 --> 37:38.260
And hey, if you want, put MBMBAM in your penalty tweet so we can see that you punished somebody.

37:38.260 --> 37:39.540
And then we can celebrate.

37:39.540 --> 37:45.140
Because what we like more than anything is people antagonizing in their name.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.300
And also people crushing people.

37:48.020 --> 37:50.420
Yeah, and really, really tearing them down.

37:50.420 --> 37:54.420
Whatever sort of artifice of pride or ego they've built up just to really dismantle that.

37:54.420 --> 37:56.740
Just make them as small as possible.

37:56.740 --> 38:04.420
Now, Griffin, if you and Travis went up in this game in Outlast, let's say you're buying it right now, who would win?

38:04.420 --> 38:05.380
Between Travis...

38:05.380 --> 38:06.820
And be clear, there's just one iPhone.

38:06.820 --> 38:08.500
Only one person needs this on their...

38:08.500 --> 38:10.580
And two people play it in person.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.580
I've been kind of quiet while we talked about this.

38:12.580 --> 38:17.140
And it's actually because when Travis said I could burp in their face, then they have to quit.

38:17.140 --> 38:22.420
And I couldn't stop thinking about just how miserable an experience that would be.

38:22.420 --> 38:24.980
So I think he would have the psychological edge over me.

38:24.980 --> 38:30.100
Are you saying you maybe wouldn't even enter into this particular Thunderdome?

38:30.100 --> 38:32.020
Because for fear of...

38:32.020 --> 38:32.820
I would do it.

38:32.820 --> 38:34.260
Just a matter of pride.

38:34.260 --> 38:39.620
But I think I would have him physically because I can go longer without eating sewage.

38:40.820 --> 38:45.140
But Travis can turn that sewage into power, you know?

38:45.140 --> 38:47.060
But I'm also very easily distracted.

38:47.060 --> 38:48.020
That is true.

38:48.020 --> 38:48.900
That's true.

38:48.900 --> 38:54.340
If he gets bored with it, you know, if he's like, oh, a butterfly, then you could have the win.

38:54.340 --> 38:54.740
He's out.

38:54.740 --> 38:54.980
Sure.

38:54.980 --> 38:56.660
Because I'm going to try to catch that butterfly.

38:56.660 --> 38:57.300
Yeah.

38:57.300 --> 38:58.420
You need two hands to do that.

38:59.220 --> 39:02.020
What would your tweet be, Griffin, for Travis if you beat him?

39:02.820 --> 39:03.620
Oh, man.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.540
It'd probably just be a bunch of racial slurs.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.100
Just one after the other.

39:14.100 --> 39:14.820
Just one after the other.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.420
And a nonsensical chain.

39:16.420 --> 39:20.260
I really want to paint with a broad brush and make sure that he really offends every

39:20.260 --> 39:21.620
people group on the planet.

39:21.620 --> 39:25.060
Do you know 140 characters worth of racial slurs?

39:26.340 --> 39:26.900
Do you?

39:26.900 --> 39:27.940
You think you could do it?

39:27.940 --> 39:28.340
Go ahead.

39:28.980 --> 39:29.780
Oh, let's see.

39:29.780 --> 39:32.660
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

39:32.660 --> 39:34.500
No, I'm going to stop Griffin from doing that.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.460
By the way, that's outlast.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.820
It's 99 cents.

39:36.820 --> 39:37.140
Get it.

39:37.140 --> 39:42.100
I'm going to stop Griffin from listing all these racial slurs with a ball gag I bought

39:42.100 --> 39:46.020
at extremistremes.com for exactly this scenario.

39:46.020 --> 39:46.500
Extremistremes.com-

39:46.500 --> 39:48.420
Now, which ball gag are you going to go with, Justin?

39:48.420 --> 39:52.260
Because I've been researching this, because I might buy a bunch of them for a play I'm

39:52.260 --> 39:52.580
doing.

39:53.380 --> 39:57.620
And you can get a training ball gag, which is smaller than the normal ball gag, just

39:57.620 --> 39:58.660
to get you used to it.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.700
And it's got a little bit of strawberry flavor, just to make it a little more-

40:01.700 --> 40:02.500
Is that-

40:02.500 --> 40:04.660
Well, and it's breathable, so it's got the holes in it.

40:04.660 --> 40:05.940
Well, that's against the elbow.

40:05.940 --> 40:06.180
That's-

40:06.740 --> 40:06.980
What are you doing?

40:06.980 --> 40:07.860
Well, it's just for training.

40:07.860 --> 40:08.820
It's to get you used to it.

40:08.820 --> 40:12.180
And then there's one that, you know, expands and you can pump it up.

40:12.180 --> 40:14.740
And then one that's like more of a leather wrap kind of deal.

40:14.740 --> 40:15.380
Sure.

40:15.380 --> 40:19.060
There's a huge variety of ball gags at extremistremes.com.

40:20.740 --> 40:24.980
There's a huge variety of pretty much every the fuck thing at extremistremes.com.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.380
Masturbation toys?

40:27.380 --> 40:28.420
They got them.

40:28.420 --> 40:29.460
Penis pumps?

40:29.460 --> 40:30.340
They are there.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.260
It's their bag, baby.

40:32.260 --> 40:32.500
Yeah.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.540
It's their bag, baby.

40:33.540 --> 40:34.020
Yeah.

40:34.020 --> 40:34.900
You guys remember that?

40:34.900 --> 40:36.340
You remember that game from Austin Powers?

40:36.340 --> 40:36.740
Awesome.

40:36.740 --> 40:37.540
Austin Powers?

40:37.540 --> 40:38.740
Man, that was a good one.

40:38.740 --> 40:39.220
You want to-

40:39.220 --> 40:40.020
Very nice.

40:41.700 --> 40:42.660
Great success.

40:42.660 --> 40:44.660
Yes, peanut butter jelly time.

40:45.300 --> 40:45.860
Where you at?

40:46.500 --> 40:47.060
Where you at?

40:47.700 --> 40:48.740
They got sex age.

40:48.740 --> 40:49.540
They got swings.

40:49.540 --> 40:49.860
Sex age?

40:49.860 --> 40:52.340
They got mis- sex aids.

40:53.060 --> 40:53.860
Oh, I don't want that.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.580
That sounds horrible.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.260
They have the fun kind of sex aids.

40:58.260 --> 40:58.740
Oh, okay.

40:59.380 --> 41:01.620
They have basically everything you could ever want.

41:01.620 --> 41:02.820
And you should-

41:02.820 --> 41:05.540
And some stuff you might not even realize you want yet.

41:05.540 --> 41:10.100
And some stuff, let's be honest, terrifies the shit out of you.

41:10.100 --> 41:10.500
Yeah.

41:10.500 --> 41:15.780
It'll make whatever weird thing you're into seem like comparatively super, super regs.

41:16.340 --> 41:18.020
It's a fun environment.

41:18.020 --> 41:19.060
Go over there and experiment.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.860
And when you do, use the coupon code.

41:21.860 --> 41:22.740
What's the coupon code?

41:22.740 --> 41:24.100
It's MIDDLEST.

41:24.100 --> 41:24.660
MIDDLEST.

41:24.660 --> 41:26.740
Use the coupon code MIDDLEST to get 20% off.

41:26.740 --> 41:29.460
M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T.

41:29.460 --> 41:33.220
I think that's part of the fun is going on that roller coaster ride to realize just what

41:33.220 --> 41:34.500
your limits are, you know?

41:34.500 --> 41:36.980
And you go in and you say, oh, scented flavored lube.

41:36.980 --> 41:37.780
That sounds cool.

41:37.780 --> 41:39.300
Uh, uh, you know, a vibrator.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.700
That, oh, that seems pretty fun.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.700
The Showstopper dildo.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.260
Okay.

41:44.260 --> 41:46.740
I think I've, I passed it a little bit.

41:46.740 --> 41:49.940
Let's backpedal a little bit and get back to territories where we feel-

41:49.940 --> 41:51.300
Find exactly where I'm comfortable.

41:51.300 --> 41:51.860
We feel fun.

41:51.860 --> 41:52.420
So that-

41:52.420 --> 41:53.540
A dildo and a candelabra-

41:53.540 --> 41:56.020
I guarantee there will be something there that you're comfortable with.

41:56.020 --> 41:57.300
A dildo candelabra.

41:58.180 --> 41:58.660
I think I-

41:58.660 --> 41:59.380
No, thank you.

41:59.380 --> 42:00.180
I think we can hang.

42:01.220 --> 42:04.340
And after you check it out, when you find a product you really like, go back to the

42:04.340 --> 42:06.100
site and write a review for it, you know?

42:06.100 --> 42:08.420
Make sure that you say, this was awesome.

42:08.420 --> 42:09.860
I love the dildo.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.780
Unless, unless you can't because you're too busy getting stuff.

42:13.780 --> 42:15.300
Oh, man.

42:16.180 --> 42:21.780
My lady friend's sister got knocked up by a questionable suitor from your hometown.

42:21.780 --> 42:23.060
That's Huntington, West Virginia.

42:23.060 --> 42:27.940
We're headed to the wedding next month and seek your guidance for things to do in Huntington

42:27.940 --> 42:32.180
that don't involve feigning confidence in the unholiest of unions.

42:32.180 --> 42:33.860
That's from Andy and Kindle.

42:33.860 --> 42:36.980
God, I think the better question is, what can't you do?

42:36.980 --> 42:37.480
Yeah.

42:38.100 --> 42:40.820
We've prepared a musical number for just this situation.

42:40.820 --> 42:41.300
Here we go.

42:41.300 --> 42:41.780
You ready?

42:41.780 --> 42:42.740
Get drunk.

42:46.260 --> 42:47.460
Griffin is correct.

42:47.460 --> 42:50.340
There are quite a few drinking establishments in Huntington.

42:51.060 --> 42:56.740
Just to name a few, you got our favorite Stumblers 2 still stumbling.

42:56.740 --> 42:57.300
Real bar.

42:57.300 --> 42:57.800
Google it.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.700
There's Peckers.

42:59.700 --> 43:00.820
Is Peckers still around?

43:00.820 --> 43:02.980
No, Peckers is now a teen nightclub.

43:02.980 --> 43:03.480
Is it?

43:03.480 --> 43:03.980
What?

43:04.500 --> 43:05.000
It is.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.580
Because it was, it was, this is the God's honest truth.

43:08.580 --> 43:13.220
It was a Christian-themed nightclub, right, called, like, Lamb of, oh, fuck, what was

43:13.220 --> 43:13.720
it called?

43:13.720 --> 43:14.220
David?

43:14.220 --> 43:15.860
No, Lamb of Babylon?

43:15.860 --> 43:17.140
No, Lamb of Fun?

43:17.140 --> 43:17.640
Fuck.

43:17.640 --> 43:27.380
No, there was Club Babylon City of Sin, which was an adjunct of the Pearl Ultra Lounge.

43:27.380 --> 43:29.860
Those were, those were the clubs that were there.

43:29.860 --> 43:32.660
Those were both in the same building, but two different names.

43:32.660 --> 43:34.660
And that was the former Renaissance Bookstore.

43:34.660 --> 43:37.380
Former Renaissance Bookstore and, for a short time, Jazz Club.

43:39.060 --> 43:45.300
You got the Thirsty Whale, which you, and the Off the Shoulder Gentleman's Club.

43:45.860 --> 43:46.360
Of course.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.180
You could go to Hank's.

43:48.820 --> 43:51.060
Hank's, Mark's, Dave's.

43:51.060 --> 43:51.780
St. Mark's Place.

43:52.340 --> 43:56.500
I've recently been informed by Google that there's a place called Jackhammer's.

43:56.500 --> 43:57.140
Oh, man.

43:57.140 --> 43:59.300
On Route 60, so make sure you get out there.

43:59.300 --> 44:01.540
You go to Driftwood or Stonewall.

44:01.540 --> 44:02.100
Yeah, those are great.

44:02.100 --> 44:03.460
Huntington's Two Gay Bars.

44:04.740 --> 44:05.940
Jackhammer's, maybe a third of them.

44:05.940 --> 44:07.460
For Huntington's Two Gay People.

44:09.060 --> 44:10.580
It's a perfect fit.

44:10.580 --> 44:12.900
They each have all the space they could want.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.420
No, they're, they're populous.

44:14.420 --> 44:14.920
What else?

44:15.860 --> 44:16.360
Hyphy.

44:17.220 --> 44:18.740
You got Hillbilly Hot Dogs.

44:18.740 --> 44:21.380
Just get yourself a Snuffy Doll with cheese or-

44:21.380 --> 44:24.100
Huntington Prime, if you're looking for something a little fancier.

44:24.100 --> 44:24.980
A little fancier.

44:24.980 --> 44:27.620
You could go stare in the windows of the Closedown Theater.

44:27.620 --> 44:28.820
He found me.

44:28.820 --> 44:29.780
Which one, you ask?

44:29.780 --> 44:30.660
Ah, take your pick.

44:31.220 --> 44:32.420
Take your pick.

44:32.420 --> 44:35.140
You could visit the burial place of Soupy Sales.

44:36.420 --> 44:37.380
Is he dead?

44:37.380 --> 44:38.020
Is he dead?

44:38.980 --> 44:40.020
He is dead.

44:40.020 --> 44:42.020
You could go stare at the river for hours.

44:42.660 --> 44:45.060
Also, you're on a lot of meth at the time.

44:45.060 --> 44:45.940
Yeah, right.

44:45.940 --> 44:46.660
You could buy meth.

44:47.860 --> 44:48.420
Yeah, sure.

44:48.420 --> 44:50.260
You can fight the urge to jump in that river.

44:51.540 --> 44:52.260
Because you'll die.

44:52.260 --> 44:54.420
Just let it take you, let it take you down.

44:54.420 --> 44:57.460
Um, and um, I think those are all the things.

44:57.460 --> 44:57.960
Mm-hmm.

44:58.900 --> 44:59.400
So...

44:59.400 --> 45:00.420
Enjoy!

45:00.420 --> 45:01.140
Have a great trip.

45:01.140 --> 45:02.100
Make sure to look me up.

45:03.140 --> 45:04.660
Uh, there are tours by my home.

45:05.300 --> 45:06.340
Ghost tours?

45:06.340 --> 45:09.780
Ghost tours, uh, by my home three times daily.

45:09.780 --> 45:14.180
Justin was near a hospital, so a lot, a lot of spectral activity up there.

45:14.180 --> 45:19.460
Yeah, I will take you on a ghost tour of some of Huntington's number one most haunted places.

45:19.460 --> 45:20.980
You, you-

45:20.980 --> 45:22.500
Ever tell you guys that story?

45:22.500 --> 45:31.460
I was, uh, I took a ghost tour in, in, uh, Savannah, uh, where, where, you know, you go around the local locations.

45:31.460 --> 45:45.780
And really, it's just an excuse to stop by local bars, and you drive around in a giant hearse, and you stop at local bars, and you get out, and you buy some, uh, even if they're not haunted, or supposedly haunted, you can still buy alcohol, because Savannah has open containers.

45:45.780 --> 45:47.860
And you get all the spirits.

45:47.860 --> 45:50.740
You get all the spirits you want, right, so you can get to travel.

45:50.740 --> 46:04.340
And, uh, travel around, and, uh, at one of these breaks, at one of these, uh, these, these, uh, you know, beer, beer breaks, uh, the driver is talking to my father-in-law, and he said, where are you guys from?

46:04.340 --> 46:05.460
And we said, West Virginia.

46:05.460 --> 46:15.060
And, uh, and he said, uh, yeah, the, the, there's a, a prison there in, in West Virginia, uh, that, that is supposedly haunted, right?

46:15.060 --> 46:20.500
And, uh, my father-in-law, Tommy, says, yeah, uh, apparently it's, it's, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

46:20.500 --> 46:24.260
One of the most haunted, uh, places in America.

46:24.260 --> 46:31.300
And the guy, I shit you not, says, well, most haunted is difficult to quantify.

46:31.300 --> 46:32.820
Oh, my God.

46:32.820 --> 46:35.060
Is it, is it, sir?

46:35.060 --> 46:37.300
Is it, is it difficult?

46:37.300 --> 46:42.020
If a place, if a place had a ghost in it, it would become the most haunted place in the world.

46:42.020 --> 46:43.220
Yeah.

46:43.220 --> 46:47.380
One, one very, like, bold ghost that was just like, I'm here.

46:47.380 --> 46:50.100
They stop by anytime.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.780
They will trot that out though.

46:51.780 --> 46:53.460
Oh, yeah, this is the most haunted.

46:53.460 --> 46:54.900
This is the most haunted cap.

46:54.900 --> 46:57.860
Per, per square foot, we got a thousand ghosts a foot.

46:57.860 --> 46:58.900
A thousand, yeah.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.300
They're all real crammed in like sardines.

47:01.300 --> 47:03.620
Can't walk from one end to the other without hitting a ghost.

47:03.620 --> 47:05.940
It's really tricky to, sorry.

47:05.940 --> 47:08.500
Got a little ghost, got a little ghost in my throat.

47:08.500 --> 47:08.980
Sorry.

47:08.980 --> 47:10.260
Sucked up some ghosts.

47:10.260 --> 47:13.940
Sucked up some, oh, I'm going to have some real bad Rio tomorrow, but that's tomorrow's problem.

47:13.940 --> 47:14.740
Eating ghost gets-

47:14.740 --> 47:18.420
We actually had to build an annex onto the prison, uh, just to house all the ghosts.

47:18.420 --> 47:20.180
You don't even know where they're coming from at this point.

47:20.180 --> 47:22.260
Do you know what I love about this fucking podcast?

47:23.140 --> 47:23.620
What's that?

47:23.620 --> 47:30.100
I can say things like eating ghosts give you diarrhea and nobody will even notice or comment

47:30.100 --> 47:30.420
on it.

47:31.860 --> 47:37.620
That is the 53rd craziest, most awful thing that has been said in this episode.

47:38.660 --> 47:38.980
Right.

47:38.980 --> 47:41.620
It's like no big deal.

47:41.620 --> 47:46.580
I, sometimes I feel like we've put enough material out into the world because there

47:46.580 --> 47:52.100
are so many layers of it of where people will have to sort of absorb, peel apart the onion

47:52.660 --> 47:57.700
of upsettingness and they will never really notice how upsetting each episode is.

47:57.700 --> 48:00.180
I think we've upset things enough, basically.

48:00.180 --> 48:04.820
Whenever somebody like tweets about like that they're just like slam jamming episodes and

48:04.820 --> 48:07.940
they're going to watch like, listen to like a hundred episodes in two weeks.

48:07.940 --> 48:11.460
I have to imagine they've got to be having just the fucking trippiest dreams.

48:11.460 --> 48:11.700
Yeah.

48:11.700 --> 48:19.780
It's just got to be a weird couple of weeks of a very leaving Las Vegas sort of experience.

48:19.780 --> 48:20.580
Let's do-

48:20.580 --> 48:22.420
That's the one with the cage, right?

48:23.620 --> 48:26.020
Yeah, they put the kid in the cage and then they-

48:26.660 --> 48:28.020
No, Nick Cage.

48:28.020 --> 48:30.180
They dip him into the big containers of ghosts.

48:30.180 --> 48:31.220
Sorry Griffin, you were going to say?

48:31.220 --> 48:33.460
I was just saying it had the kid and the cage and the-

48:33.460 --> 48:34.980
No, I got it.

48:34.980 --> 48:36.420
So how about one more Yahoo?

48:37.220 --> 48:37.620
Yeah, let's do it.

48:37.620 --> 48:38.820
It was sent in by Josh Dykes.

48:38.820 --> 48:39.300
Thanks Josh.

48:39.300 --> 48:41.940
It's by Yahoo answers user Anon21 who says,

48:43.540 --> 48:46.020
would you love your child if they turned into a snake?

48:49.300 --> 48:51.620
No, I think if a child-

48:51.620 --> 48:52.420
Wait, wait, wait.

48:53.140 --> 48:53.700
Your child-

48:53.700 --> 48:55.220
Can the child turn back?

48:55.220 --> 48:55.460
Yeah.

48:55.460 --> 48:58.180
Is it permanent or is he like an Asian animal?

48:58.180 --> 49:00.500
See, I think that, that not-

49:00.500 --> 49:04.420
Well, first off, everybody knows that if an animal stays in his animal for longer than 60 minutes,

49:04.420 --> 49:06.020
they're stuck as that animal forever anyway.

49:06.020 --> 49:08.100
I'm not saying he would remain the snake, Griffin.

49:08.100 --> 49:09.860
I'm saying that he becomes a snake-

49:09.860 --> 49:11.700
In that one hour window, would you still love him?

49:12.420 --> 49:12.980
That's true.

49:12.980 --> 49:16.580
I feel like the uncertainty of not, of knowing, you know,

49:16.580 --> 49:19.140
is my kid ever going to be a kid, a human kid again?

49:19.780 --> 49:22.660
Does he still have the mind of a human or is he all snake?

49:22.660 --> 49:23.380
Oh my God.

49:23.380 --> 49:24.820
Can you imagine?

49:24.820 --> 49:25.220
Snake.

49:25.220 --> 49:27.620
If he's got mind of a human, yes, of course you still love him.

49:27.620 --> 49:30.020
But if he's all snake, he's going to bite you if you try to love him.

49:30.020 --> 49:30.580
Oh my God.

49:30.580 --> 49:32.500
But it's even worse if he has the mind of a human.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.620
That's what I'm saying.

49:33.620 --> 49:36.820
Snake body, snake teeth and venom, but the brain of a human being?

49:36.820 --> 49:39.220
But then we're getting into fucking Kafka shit.

49:39.220 --> 49:43.060
And if he's got the mind of a human, then he's still like your boy.

49:43.060 --> 49:43.460
I wouldn't-

49:43.460 --> 49:45.380
But if he's got the mind of a snake-

49:45.380 --> 49:47.860
He spirals himself around your arm and it's like,

49:47.860 --> 49:49.380
oh, nice, you're trying to give me a hug.

49:49.380 --> 49:50.580
That's really grody.

49:50.580 --> 49:51.620
Can you please get off me?

49:51.620 --> 49:52.340
I realize you're my child.

49:52.340 --> 49:54.900
Can he still speak English or is he only speak snake?

49:54.900 --> 49:55.940
Is he a parcel tongue?

49:57.620 --> 49:58.420
I think it might.

49:58.420 --> 50:02.340
What's worse, the people who do that are people who do treat their snakes like their children.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.420
Because there are those people too.

50:04.420 --> 50:06.420
And I don't want to be mistaken for one of them.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.900
I think I would rather have a snake that was always a snake.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.660
Because if I had a snake that used to be a child-

50:10.660 --> 50:14.180
Well, yes, Travis, that is not an option that has been afforded to these poor parents.

50:14.180 --> 50:15.860
I wish you were a snake all along.

50:15.860 --> 50:16.500
That's not it.

50:16.500 --> 50:17.300
The gypsy's curse-

50:17.300 --> 50:20.820
No, I'm saying that given there is a difference.

50:20.820 --> 50:21.300
Because if it was always a snake-

50:21.300 --> 50:22.820
There's a difference between a snake that's been a snake-

50:22.820 --> 50:25.060
If Travis was a snake, it might have ghost memories.

50:25.060 --> 50:25.540
Ah, shit.

50:25.540 --> 50:27.620
There's the biggest difference, Travis.

50:27.620 --> 50:30.580
You're talking about the difference between buying something at the pet store

50:30.580 --> 50:33.540
and seeing your progeny transformed into a reptile.

50:33.540 --> 50:34.980
You asked what's the difference between the-

50:34.980 --> 50:37.300
Which worse? Those people are like-

50:37.300 --> 50:38.260
There's nothing worse.

50:38.260 --> 50:40.580
It's not even up for grabs.

50:40.580 --> 50:44.340
You have to watch your child become scaly and cylindrical.

50:44.340 --> 50:45.220
That's the worst.

50:45.220 --> 50:47.300
Well, what about the people that have monkey babies?

50:47.300 --> 50:48.180
Which one's worse?

50:48.180 --> 50:49.540
Getting a monkey and treating it like a baby

50:49.540 --> 50:51.620
or having a baby and have it turn into a monkey?

50:51.620 --> 50:53.380
Wait, are you saying people who have monkey babies

50:53.380 --> 50:54.980
buy monkeys and then treat them like the babies

50:54.980 --> 50:56.260
and put them in diapers and shit?

50:56.260 --> 50:56.980
Yes.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.180
Those people are the pets.

50:58.180 --> 50:58.740
They are the worst.

50:58.740 --> 50:59.220
Okay.

50:59.220 --> 51:02.180
I want both of you to imagine you have a son or a daughter.

51:02.180 --> 51:02.740
Okay.

51:02.740 --> 51:03.620
All right.

51:03.620 --> 51:05.220
No, let's go with a son.

51:05.220 --> 51:05.540
Okay.

51:05.540 --> 51:06.660
And it turned into a snake.

51:08.420 --> 51:09.620
Let's cut the abstraction.

51:10.660 --> 51:10.900
Okay.

51:10.900 --> 51:13.060
Hey, cut the abstraction, you guys.

51:13.060 --> 51:14.820
Your kid just turned into a snake.

51:14.820 --> 51:16.020
Step one.

51:16.020 --> 51:16.740
What do you do?

51:16.740 --> 51:17.300
How big?

51:17.300 --> 51:18.100
How big a snake?

51:18.100 --> 51:18.580
Up to you.

51:18.580 --> 51:19.540
Could be a corn snake.

51:19.540 --> 51:20.660
Could be a king rattler.

51:22.020 --> 51:23.860
I'm going to go with a bow constrictor.

51:23.860 --> 51:24.660
Okay.

51:24.660 --> 51:25.700
Travis, what would you do first?

51:25.700 --> 51:26.660
What's the first thing you do?

51:27.300 --> 51:28.340
I'd probably kill it.

51:28.340 --> 51:31.540
Okay.

51:31.540 --> 51:33.460
It's abomination against man and God.

51:36.100 --> 51:36.580
Okay.

51:36.580 --> 51:39.380
On the next episode of True Blood, it's short.

51:39.940 --> 51:41.140
It's a short ep.

51:41.140 --> 51:42.900
Well, here's what I need to know.

51:42.900 --> 51:43.220
Okay.

51:43.220 --> 51:46.740
And I bet this is one of those things I just couldn't know beforehand.

51:46.740 --> 51:49.860
When I kill it, does it turn back into a kid?

51:49.860 --> 51:50.500
Oh, that's bad.

51:50.500 --> 51:52.660
Because then I got to deal with the cops.

51:52.660 --> 51:53.220
Yeah.

51:53.220 --> 51:53.460
Yeah.

51:53.460 --> 51:57.140
Just real quick, I want to back up to True Blood.

51:57.140 --> 52:01.380
Would that show be as popular if instead of vampires, they were snakes?

52:03.700 --> 52:06.740
I think it would still be a pretty good show.

52:06.740 --> 52:07.220
Yeah, it's just-

52:07.220 --> 52:07.780
Suck it.

52:10.180 --> 52:12.180
That one sustains you.

52:12.180 --> 52:14.180
Sustains me.

52:14.180 --> 52:15.060
Suck it.

52:15.060 --> 52:19.220
Because everybody does know when you get bit by a snake, you do turn into one.

52:20.260 --> 52:22.260
Yeah, but it's the slowest fucking process.

52:22.260 --> 52:23.540
The slowest fucking process.

52:23.540 --> 52:24.820
That is the plot of the Bible.

52:26.740 --> 52:30.500
You may recognize that as the Bible, what the Bible's about.

52:32.100 --> 52:35.860
Thank you guys so much for listening to our podcast.

52:35.860 --> 52:39.700
It's called My Brother, My Brother, Me, and it's in theory an advice show.

52:40.740 --> 52:46.740
Thank you to people who wrote into us in physical space.

52:46.740 --> 52:47.460
We got one from-

52:47.460 --> 52:48.740
Really?

52:48.740 --> 52:49.220
Yeah.

52:49.220 --> 52:49.620
Yeah, I know.

52:49.620 --> 52:52.340
We got a postcard from Zena.

52:53.060 --> 53:01.620
We got another postcard from Janelle and Jen, and we got a letter from Eric Bailey that just says,

53:01.620 --> 53:04.180
he enjoys our work and is grateful for our talent.

53:04.180 --> 53:10.020
I also got another postcard that had a delightful picture of three mountaineer men

53:11.460 --> 53:14.180
that compared us to them that I thought was very funny, but it's not.

53:14.180 --> 53:15.620
My fingertips right now.

53:15.620 --> 53:22.420
If you want to write us, it is PO Box, just do Justin McElroy, PO Box 54,

53:23.620 --> 53:28.980
Huntington, West Virginia, 25706, and we will check that out,

53:28.980 --> 53:30.580
and it makes my day to have something.

53:30.580 --> 53:31.380
Send anything you want.

53:31.380 --> 53:34.820
When you go to the post office to get your mail,

53:34.820 --> 53:36.980
do the people there look at you like you're a big deal?

53:37.780 --> 53:39.940
Yeah, they say like, wow, this guy looks kind of famous.

53:39.940 --> 53:43.540
How long do you think before they hand you a big canvas sack that says fan mail?

53:43.540 --> 53:44.740
Mm-hmm.

53:44.740 --> 53:46.740
Or how long before you walk in there and they're like,

53:46.740 --> 53:48.900
hey, something of yours set off the anthrax alarm.

53:50.740 --> 53:51.860
Your box exploded.

53:51.860 --> 53:52.020
Yeah.

53:52.740 --> 53:53.620
Thank you to people.

53:55.460 --> 53:57.700
Now, hey, man, I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

53:57.700 --> 53:58.980
It looks like your box exploded.

53:59.940 --> 54:01.460
Yeah, someone sent something in a big box,

54:01.460 --> 54:03.380
said cookies on it, but I don't think it had cookies in it,

54:03.380 --> 54:05.060
because goddamn box exploded, man.

54:08.660 --> 54:09.940
Poor Larry the cable guy.

54:09.940 --> 54:11.060
He's had a bad run, man.

54:11.060 --> 54:14.180
Hey, man, that box of cookies really got her done.

54:15.460 --> 54:16.740
Boy ain't right.

54:16.740 --> 54:17.240
What?

54:18.420 --> 54:21.940
Amersman, people who tweeted about the show.

54:21.940 --> 54:28.420
Jordan Snyder, Joey Blanton, Kat, Tyler Matheson, Oscar Gomez,

54:30.500 --> 54:35.780
Mondrial, D McRitt, Evanis Awesome, Indie Mike.

54:35.780 --> 54:37.540
Thank you guys so much for tweeting about the show.

54:37.540 --> 54:43.140
Use the NBNBAM hashtag if you do that,

54:43.700 --> 54:46.740
and we'll be sure that we read all those pretty obsessively.

54:46.740 --> 54:48.820
Also, might I suggest following,

54:48.820 --> 54:50.900
and maybe this is gauche of me to suggest following it,

54:50.900 --> 54:56.740
but I would suggest following NBNBAM wisdom at NBNBAM wisdom.

54:58.340 --> 55:00.100
That account retweets quotes from our show,

55:00.100 --> 55:01.700
and they make us sound funny.

55:01.700 --> 55:06.740
They very nicely tweeted at me to say that after I accused them

55:06.740 --> 55:07.940
of stealing all of our jokes,

55:08.980 --> 55:11.460
I think I called them the Carlos Mencia of Twitter.

55:11.460 --> 55:14.500
They tweeted at me to inform me that that is not what they were doing,

55:14.500 --> 55:16.900
which I guess nullifies the crime.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.740
I guess we're all okay now.

55:21.460 --> 55:23.700
So thank you to everybody who tweets about the show,

55:23.700 --> 55:26.660
and thank you to everyone.

55:26.660 --> 55:28.900
Griffin, are you certain it's not Carlos Mencia?

55:28.900 --> 55:30.500
It may be, in fact, Carlos Mencia.

55:31.380 --> 55:36.340
The email address for our show is NBNBAM at maximumfun.org.

55:36.340 --> 55:38.420
While you're typing those letters in,

55:38.420 --> 55:40.980
why not copy and paste the maximumfun.org part?

55:40.980 --> 55:43.140
Go listen to other shows like Throwing Shades.

55:43.140 --> 55:44.980
Cast yourself, Jordan Jesse Goebelzai,

55:45.620 --> 55:47.060
Judge John Hodgman, and go to the forums.

55:47.060 --> 55:47.700
And Memory Palace.

55:48.660 --> 55:49.620
And Memory Palace.

55:49.620 --> 55:50.020
It's there.

55:50.020 --> 55:50.740
It's in the family.

55:51.380 --> 55:52.980
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

55:52.980 --> 55:53.780
for the use of our theme song,

55:53.780 --> 55:56.020
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.100
You know, when I edit the episode, I just sort of drop it in.

56:00.100 --> 56:03.940
I don't really listen to it, but I gave a listen to the episode.

56:03.940 --> 56:05.300
I think maybe the last one we did.

56:05.300 --> 56:08.580
Uh, man, god damn, that song's so good.

56:08.580 --> 56:09.540
