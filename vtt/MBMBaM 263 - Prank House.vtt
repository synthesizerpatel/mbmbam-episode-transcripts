The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:47.840 --> 00:54.080
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy.

00:54.080 --> 01:02.240
I'm your babiest brother Griffin Liebowitz. Boy, Griffin are you using your married name?

01:03.120 --> 01:10.240
I'm using my stage name Griffin Liebowitz. Griffin, Griffin the experience Liebowitz.

01:11.120 --> 01:17.440
I like that. You know guys I'm getting pretty excited. It's back to school time.

01:18.320 --> 01:23.040
And how does that affect your day-to-day life Justin? Well finally I can ship this kid off for

01:23.040 --> 01:28.080
eight hours a day and get a little time back to myself. I don't see why you can't. Get it get a

01:28.080 --> 01:35.840
leg up get an early start. It takes 10,000 hours to become a master of school. Start it now. Start

01:35.840 --> 01:44.240
it now. All right does your uh are your is your entire school are all the sharp edges foamed over?

01:44.800 --> 01:49.040
Have you foamed over every sharp edge in your school? Listen I'm gonna. These stairs that you

01:49.040 --> 01:56.320
have what is that about like stairs? I'm gonna need a strict no bullying guarantee from you

01:56.320 --> 02:03.360
because my baby can't stand it can't she's an amazing child she cannot stand up to much

02:04.000 --> 02:09.600
physical bullying. She can't stand up very well. She can't stand up either but but if she starts

02:09.600 --> 02:15.840
getting bullied it's she doesn't have the tools to protect herself. I noticed that uh at 10 a.m.

02:15.840 --> 02:23.440
you have her scheduled for uh pre-algebra that's crazy because she'll be asleep. Where is her

02:23.440 --> 02:29.440
where is her nap zone? Um is there a class I can enroll her in where she watches shapes and colors

02:29.440 --> 02:34.960
move on an iPad? Do you have any uh parental incentives for good grades like some sort of

02:34.960 --> 02:42.400
Pizza Hut program for me? Wait that doesn't happen for like regular kids in school. Yeah but I've

02:42.400 --> 02:46.160
never been a parent before Travis I don't know this stuff maybe that maybe parents have been

02:46.160 --> 02:51.120
getting pizza kickbacks the entire time. That's the only reason I can think of that parents care

02:51.120 --> 02:57.280
about grades. Maybe the whole reason parents have been so uptight about grades since time

02:57.280 --> 03:02.160
immemorial is that they've been getting pizza kickbacks. You're suggesting that when kids pull

03:02.160 --> 03:11.680
down a tight GPA their parents reap the the that sweet pie that sweet pizza pie as a reward? They

03:11.680 --> 03:19.040
get if the kids get a good GPA the parents get a PWATF which is a pizza with all the fixings. Okay

03:19.040 --> 03:25.360
and some maybe some tokens if they do real good. Maybe a few tokens for the folks. Is there an

03:25.360 --> 03:32.720
adult equivalent to like back to school is it first day on the job? This is that that is Travis

03:32.720 --> 03:37.200
you have highlighted one of the primary problems with adulthood is the lack of like sort of a

03:37.200 --> 03:43.120
a cyclical period of renewal. You know that that's what adulthood is lacking that's why

03:43.120 --> 03:51.600
adulthood is what it is bad because they lack. Hey turn it off now we're getting real. Nobody

03:51.600 --> 03:58.640
said like when you're a kid it is the okay being a kid is the time in your life where I think you

03:58.640 --> 04:06.240
least need someone to be like just take a break my man. You are burning the candle at both ends

04:06.240 --> 04:13.040
Devin. Yeah just this is so what you work from seven to three and then you have nothing to do

04:13.040 --> 04:17.920
at all like you can literally have a time when you sit and say I don't have anything to worry

04:17.920 --> 04:25.040
about right now like I don't have anything I should be doing. That's crazy. Yeah that's insane. Do you

04:25.040 --> 04:31.520
know how crazy it is there are humans walking across this earth who like can sit in a chair

04:31.520 --> 04:36.720
and not have something they should be doing at that exact instant and then someone comes and says

04:36.720 --> 04:44.080
hey you look tired take three months off. Oh and by the way in taking three months off you are

04:44.080 --> 04:50.480
generating another thing for the adults that live with you to be worried about like you're creating

04:50.480 --> 04:59.280
more stress for them but you seriously you look beat take three months off. It's insane. Do you

04:59.280 --> 05:05.520
guys think that the three of us are slowly becoming this this this um this weekly podcast that we put

05:05.520 --> 05:10.400
out is slowly becoming some sort of digital embodiment of Andy Rooney like it's somehow

05:10.400 --> 05:14.720
you know that movie transcendence where Johnny Depp uploads himself into the matrix or some

05:14.720 --> 05:18.640
shit I didn't see it I watched a little bit of it on I'm playing muted. I listened to Flophouse

05:18.640 --> 05:23.360
they pretty much ran through it for me. Okay um I think that might be I think Andy Rooney might

05:23.360 --> 05:31.680
be us in the podcast form. Maybe but maybe it's like not that Andy Rooney like maybe we're not

05:31.680 --> 05:37.600
growing into like cantankerous old men like Andy Rooney maybe like the older I get Andy Rooney just

05:37.600 --> 05:44.160
starts to make some sense right like what are all these different fruits the supermarket right?

05:44.800 --> 05:47.600
Do you remember when yogurt used to just taste like yogurt?

05:47.600 --> 05:52.080
Maybe it just tasted like tangy yogurt. I can't go with you guys on this one.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.560
You will Griffin, see you in three hours.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.600
I like exotic fruits I like exotic yogurt flavors.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.360
I had a I had a fun exotic fruit experience a couple weeks ago I bought I was at the the

06:05.360 --> 06:12.000
Cha-Cha Kroger again epicenter of all the best anecdotes and I found a fruit that I didn't

06:12.000 --> 06:17.680
recognize it was really weird it had like a spiny outside and like it looked kind of good like I

06:17.680 --> 06:24.720
don't know I'll try anything once and I got to the cash register and the woman didn't obviously

06:25.520 --> 06:30.480
like because who does she didn't notice what the fruit was called there was no sticker or anything

06:30.480 --> 06:36.640
on it so she asked me what it was so she could ring it up and I had no like I had no glare so

06:36.640 --> 06:41.120
I'm in this situation where I'm looking like this woman's like so you're buying it yes

06:41.120 --> 06:49.680
you know what it is I do not know I don't Justin to be fair she's the most in the wrong because

06:49.680 --> 06:55.200
she should be like the the experienced professional working there you're you're going on a new flavor

06:55.200 --> 07:00.080
experience she's the one who's supposed to be in the know she's paid to work there yeah but like

07:00.080 --> 07:06.240
I okay Travis this poor woman works at Kroger at like one o'clock in the afternoon like I don't

07:06.240 --> 07:12.320
expect her to be my exotic flavor sommelier but don't you feel like you look cooler when she's

07:12.320 --> 07:16.880
like do you know what it's called and you're like nope but I'm gonna eat it no I look like an idiot

07:16.880 --> 07:22.240
you look like an impulsive idiot yeah because you're also in that moment you're also admitting

07:22.240 --> 07:27.840
I don't know I just saw it and I thought me and you are this is destiny I can eat this you're a

07:27.840 --> 07:34.320
weird fruit get in my face was it a durian maybe it was a no it was like a it was like inside it

07:34.320 --> 07:40.160
was like a grape but on the outside it had hard I think you ate like some sort of alien seed

07:40.160 --> 07:44.400
that the government put there and now you're gonna have like superpowers it's gonna be like district

07:44.400 --> 07:51.280
nine I would like to think that it's that would have started this culminated with me this culminated

07:51.280 --> 08:00.560
with me googling a loose description of the image of the fruit in the hopes that I could figure out

08:00.560 --> 08:06.880
what it was called spiny spiny fruit Justin wants to eat spiny fruit to eat for inside small

08:07.920 --> 08:16.400
spiny fruit how to eat cash cashier also doesn't know what is sold at Kroger Kroger exotic spike

08:16.400 --> 08:23.920

08:54.400 --> 09:04.480
court hacks your pal and shaman shaman thanks Drew your pal and Drew Davenport and not Shyamalan

09:06.000 --> 09:11.760
Justin didn't you want I feel like you once told me or read a thing that was like pick a day when

09:11.760 --> 09:17.840
you know the cops off duty and then he won't show up and like write down his badge number and yes

09:17.840 --> 09:22.720
Travis I have some hacks that I read on the internet 10 years ago that I've never tried

09:22.720 --> 09:27.520
that may or may not work that's the first one is figure out when the officer the arresting

09:27.520 --> 09:32.880
officer will have the day off because you're supposed to be able to face your accuser in court

09:32.880 --> 09:38.240
how do you get that information you call them and say hey I'd like to give you a free vacation you

09:38.240 --> 09:47.600
got any time off coming up this is uh Disney this is Walt Disney this is Craig Disney you got kids

09:47.600 --> 09:54.720
what are the names it's good for grown-ups too we just got a margaritaville get down here

09:55.600 --> 10:00.400
you gotta get down here right on the mystic mountain have the other one I've I've I heard

10:00.400 --> 10:06.880
is that if you go to the uh like the courthouse and you file a discovery motion on your case

10:06.880 --> 10:13.520
then you can find out when the last time the speed gun that they used to get you was uh uh

10:13.520 --> 10:17.520
updated or like checked for and there's like a certain time period in which they're supposed to

10:17.520 --> 10:22.480
be checked and if it hasn't been checked in during that time period then you can get it thrown out

10:22.480 --> 10:28.400
I've heard that too have you guys ever contested anything in court yes I got a ticket for an

10:28.400 --> 10:34.000
expired inspection wiped a few times because that's how I would know when it was time to

10:34.000 --> 10:38.160
actually get my inspection oh yeah that's a McElroy special I did that took me three years

10:38.160 --> 10:41.920
they towed the car and the dude tearing the car when I was like I'll go get it right now and he

10:41.920 --> 10:47.040
was like it's been three years man I don't know what you want me to do um like he apologized to

10:47.040 --> 10:52.240
me for towing my car Griffin what did you what did you contest in court so there was after Justin

10:52.240 --> 10:57.200
you gave me the Oldsmobile and thank you I don't thank you enough for that thank you the Cutlass

10:57.200 --> 11:03.120
thank you for that Supreme car that tight Cutlass Sierra um that had no brakes when you gave it to

11:03.120 --> 11:09.200
me and I never just repaired that particular malady uh I uh there was a cop that came by

11:09.200 --> 11:14.880
and gave me a ticket every day for like two weeks he just drove by the house and gave me a ticket

11:14.880 --> 11:19.360
and like there's a long period where the car wouldn't run uh we didn't like have the title for

11:19.360 --> 11:22.480
it for some reason I was in the process of like requesting a new title but there was so much other

11:22.480 --> 11:25.600
paperwork I had to get there was nothing I could do this car was just gonna sit in place and get

11:25.600 --> 11:29.280
tickets until I could get the paperwork and I was waiting on the paperwork and this dick cop would

11:29.280 --> 11:35.040
just like roll by every day and give me a ticket in the same spot uh and so I stopped paying them

11:35.040 --> 11:38.480
until I got all that stuff figured out and knowing that I could like go to court and explain the

11:38.480 --> 11:43.120
situation away and one morning he caught me getting into my car going to school and he was like

11:43.120 --> 11:47.040
riding me up a ticket and he was like you can either come with me to court right now and pay

11:47.040 --> 11:53.520
these off or I'm gonna take you to jail and I was like whoa damn because at that point it was like

11:53.520 --> 11:59.200
maybe almost a grand I was in college I didn't have a grand so I went and I paid half of it and

11:59.200 --> 12:03.600
then they said you have to pay half of it now and you can contest the rest later and so I went to

12:03.600 --> 12:09.760
jail I went to I didn't go to jail I was in jail I went to court I was facing like 500 other dollars

12:09.760 --> 12:17.360
in fines and uh my secret here's my little pro tip for you drew davenport I was a I was a freshman

12:17.360 --> 12:24.240

like it was literally it was chicken scratch and I told the clerk I was like listen I can't contest

13:34.720 --> 13:39.040
this I can't tell you if it like what the deal is because I can't read the ticket so I don't

13:39.040 --> 13:42.960
I don't know what it's for I knew what it was for but I was like I don't know what it's because it

13:42.960 --> 13:46.400
was I was too far away from the curb that used to be a big problem for me because I only drove

13:46.400 --> 13:52.000

13:52.000 --> 14:00.160
what I'll say Drew Davenport I know you you are a you are a mountain of a man statuesque uh very

14:00.160 --> 14:09.280

behind that cry and you can you oh a whale herd down the street mine mine was sort of a pitiful

14:22.720 --> 14:30.080
like and that's not the style that you want to go for you need a full complete emotional breakdown

in the system that we have mentioned here are are pretty much just applicable to white people

15:22.160 --> 15:29.840
because the the country is broken but other than that go go go for it but i think i i don't know i

15:29.840 --> 15:34.240

15:52.560 --> 15:58.480

this up and i don't think we're gonna get a lot of talking talking points out of this but this week

16:31.280 --> 16:36.720
ronda rousey the strongest human being currently living did an interview on some red carpet where

16:36.720 --> 16:41.280
she talked about pokemon flight five minutes god she just keeps getting cooler and cooler

16:41.280 --> 16:45.040
she buys every pokemon game all the pokemon cards she's got them all she catches them all

16:45.680 --> 16:51.920
and i think i want to get we have a lot of listeners at this point billions basically

16:51.920 --> 16:58.000
i want to try and get some sort of campaign going to have a pokemon duel with ronda rousey

16:58.000 --> 17:02.720
oh can we please make that happen okay here's how we'll sweeten the pot ronda rousey if you're

17:02.720 --> 17:08.400
listening griffin will duel you in pokemon and then you guys can fight like in a ring

17:08.400 --> 17:13.920
so that way you get griffin's strength you get your strength and then we'll do a tie breaker

yeah ernie hudson's big big big big in a pokemon cards uh anyway i just listened this was all this

18:17.440 --> 18:22.000
is um a little self-serving a little self-serving but i did just want to get that out there if

18:22.000 --> 18:28.480
anybody knows ronda uh i'm not even i'm not even like bragging like i want to take down ronda i

18:28.480 --> 18:33.840
i'm i she would probably beat me in that like she's she probably knows the best way to fight in any

18:33.840 --> 18:40.880
like terms right like if right if we played uh canasta like she would she just would know how

18:40.880 --> 18:45.280
to be a champion how did you punch me how did you find a rule that let you punch me in the head

18:45.920 --> 18:51.120
it says right here i can't contest it this is a this is a deep index how about this other yadru

18:51.680 --> 18:56.160
uh it's in my drew davenport it's by yadru answers user miss who asks

18:58.240 --> 19:04.720
i need good ideas on a trap to set up on my roommate who is snooping through my

19:04.720 --> 19:12.080
my four asterisks i'm gonna guess shit but who's snooping through my butt every time i leave

19:13.120 --> 19:18.640
i don't oh that's funny i don't want water traps i want something that is going to make her think

19:18.640 --> 19:25.840
twice about going in my room ever again so like incendiary devices we're looking how deadly do

19:25.840 --> 19:35.200
you want to go is this like punitive or like uh i have a suggestion uh that i'd like to suggest

19:36.080 --> 19:42.400
if i may be a so bold oh my god i know exactly where it's going this is a suggestion that you

19:42.400 --> 19:50.320
can employ with uh under three dollars i think probably two if you buy store brand how could i

19:50.320 --> 19:56.080
not see this coming what if you the next time your roommate goes to peruse your belongings

19:56.080 --> 20:04.960
in your underwear drawer they find oh surprise surprise their hand has not been embedded in

20:04.960 --> 20:14.720
your delicates your delicate unmentionables but in fact has found its way to a jar of jelly okay

20:14.720 --> 20:21.520
so now just wait i have a very important question here yes do you remove your unmentionables first

20:21.520 --> 20:26.560
before you fill the drawer with jelly yeah there's gonna be flies that's uh that's one

20:26.560 --> 20:34.000
of many problems the jelly underneath a particularly tantalizing pair of oh my god

20:34.000 --> 20:40.480
one that they definitely try to rifle through maybe you put on the jar drugs and money here

20:40.480 --> 20:47.120
uh-huh and you replace the label and then they go to retrieve their treasure and instead find

20:47.120 --> 20:53.520
some strawberry preserves wait hold on you're changing your story are we talking preserves

20:53.520 --> 21:00.960
or are we talking jelly sir uh it depends on the part of the country and seasonal availability you

21:00.960 --> 21:06.400
have to buy locally grown fair enough is the thing or else she could become allergic go to your

21:06.400 --> 21:11.280
farmers market ask for the jar that the people would least like to have their hand stuck in

21:11.280 --> 21:17.680
they'll know what you're what's your best prank jelly can i justin i don't want to be contrarian

21:17.680 --> 21:24.400
here because i know how deeply you subscribe to this this jelly notion also jelly the knobs

21:24.400 --> 21:30.960
oh my god you jelly those drawer knobs oh big okay now you're just being redundant then because

21:30.960 --> 21:34.800
if you're if you jelly the knobs they're not going to move they're not going to go deeper into the

21:34.800 --> 21:41.200
drawer unless they're using unless they're using a handkerchief to hide their fingerprints in which

21:41.200 --> 21:48.320
case they wouldn't even notice the primary oh i see always always have backup jelly um let me

21:48.320 --> 21:54.160
hit you with this idea though without jelly because jelly's good it'll stain your whites

21:54.160 --> 22:02.080
and that's i guess has a sort of a long-lasting prank effect and um i'm into that i think a more

22:02.080 --> 22:10.000
more effective deterrent solution would be honey you get honey on your hands that's your whole day

22:10.000 --> 22:15.840
i used to watch winnie the pooh and i would have anxiety attacks oh that's his whole day he's got

22:15.840 --> 22:20.480
honey on his face and his hands and he's covered in fur and that's going to complicate things even

22:20.480 --> 22:24.160
further i don't have fur and it takes me a good two to three hours of scrubbing to get any honey

22:24.160 --> 22:29.680
off my body but even if it's only a smack roll a smack a smack roll doesn't matter the amount i'm

22:29.680 --> 22:33.840
saying the effort is going to be the same i'm sorry it doesn't matter the amount griffin i

22:33.840 --> 22:40.160
think it does there is one huge flaw with your plan okay the the difference and i hate to get

22:40.160 --> 22:45.920
into the aesthetics of this no get into it that's why that's why people listen to the show if you

22:45.920 --> 22:52.960
dip your hand in a jar of honey you human instinct will will kick in and say well just lick it off

22:52.960 --> 23:01.440
you're fine if you put your hand in a jar of jelly you can't it's too you just can't you can't lick

23:01.440 --> 23:07.200
the jelly off like honey you can lick off you can't lick the jelly off you feel like an animal

23:07.200 --> 23:11.520
there's no way there's no way that's not a deterrent because they'll lick the honey off

23:11.520 --> 23:16.000
thanks for the smack roll and then they'll dig right back into your jar but then they will get

23:16.000 --> 23:20.640
stuck in the hole trying to climb out of your room and then piglet will have to push on them

23:20.640 --> 23:26.080
eeyore will have to push on them you just you're gonna get stuck you're seeing honey as being uh

23:26.080 --> 23:33.760
almost a treat a a prank reward if you will i'm we can channel human nature to further the prank

23:33.760 --> 23:39.360
what's that you go off to lick lick the honey off your hands but it's prank stink honey

23:41.440 --> 23:49.360
it's stink honey it's jb custer's stink honey and you go to lick it off you get one taste of that

23:49.360 --> 23:56.560
your mouth oh no this isn't funny at all hi folks i'm jb custer oh settle down butch that's my dog

23:56.560 --> 24:04.320
butch listen when you're looking for the best in prankables reach for a jar of jb custer's stink

24:04.320 --> 24:11.760
honey it's delicious it tastes great and it tastes great and stinks to high heaven how does it taste

24:12.400 --> 24:16.640
smell is such a big factor in taste how does it smell so bad and tastes so damn good

24:16.640 --> 24:23.760
the trick about my stink the stink honey trick is if you wait like a half hour it smells good

24:23.760 --> 24:29.760
so it's like uh it's like invisible ink disappearing stink is like it you you it smells

24:29.760 --> 24:33.920
bad and then if you wait long enough you just have patience aerate it out a little bit then it starts

24:33.920 --> 24:39.840
to smell good again but if you wait too long it does harden into an unbreakable crust the other

24:39.840 --> 24:44.640
problem with your playing griffin is that honey is poison to babies so if there's a baby going

24:44.640 --> 24:48.880
through your drawer you just killed a baby so congratulations but they would sway you

24:48.880 --> 24:55.440
but the person knows that unless do you have unless do you have a baby roommate do you have

24:55.440 --> 25:03.280
a roommate who's using a baby as a front line of defense oh a baby agent a disarming baby a baby

25:03.280 --> 25:08.800
in the coal mine if you will you're they're sending the baby out first to check for trap jars

25:08.800 --> 25:14.080
how is it living with ashton kutcher it's pretty good um the rent isn't as expensive

25:14.080 --> 25:19.440
as you would think it would be but i did have to have to hire a safety baby to just like enter in

25:19.440 --> 25:24.880
rooms before i do and to like open any drawer that i need to like access for any reason because

25:26.000 --> 25:30.720
you never know there there might be like uh i don't know like a naked man and it's uncomfortable

25:30.720 --> 25:34.400
it's like an uncomfortable situation or you open up the toilet and there's like a human head in

25:34.400 --> 25:39.520
there or he'll leave his door slightly jar so you think it's okay to go in and then you'll find him

25:39.520 --> 25:46.240
in flagrante with a young hollywood starlet how is that a prank what he looks up he looks

25:46.240 --> 25:51.360
up from the act of love making and says gotcha because that's what they that's what they said

25:52.480 --> 25:58.080
wait just to be clear just to be clear ashton kutcher looks up after his prank and what he

25:58.080 --> 26:03.840
says is gotcha yeah that's what he says that's what the name of the show gotcha punks hey let's

26:03.840 --> 26:09.040
do another question uh my wife always chides me in the way i carry groceries from the trunk of

26:09.040 --> 26:14.080
the car to the kitchen counter i take as many bags as i can carry so i can make the fewest number of

26:14.080 --> 26:19.760
trips she calls it the lazy man's load but i completely disagree i feel like it's the opposite

26:19.760 --> 26:26.240
it's the strong man's load since my arms are way down to the max am i being truly lazy and carrying

26:26.240 --> 26:32.240
only one bag at a time as opposed to being truly lazy and carrying only one bag at a time what say

26:32.240 --> 26:41.680
you brothers that's from shooting in chicago i i'm 100 with the question asker yeah absolutely i

26:41.680 --> 26:48.080
don't have much i don't have much opportunity for strength training in my life so i need that i mean

26:48.080 --> 26:52.880
it's it's good because it gets the job done quick but also i feel like macho man randy savage

26:52.880 --> 26:57.440
carrying all those bags there has never been a time when i've come in from the car with bags

26:57.440 --> 27:02.960
weighing down my arms when i haven't looked at my wife and like expected like a whoa look at how

27:02.960 --> 27:08.800
many you're carrying i want i want some sort of sensor embedded above the door so that whenever

27:08.800 --> 27:16.000
i come in carrying a big old arm of macho man randy savage groceries i want the john cena theme

27:16.000 --> 27:21.120
song to play like just trumpeting me in the room look at his arms look at the definition look at

27:21.120 --> 27:26.000
the tone how could he carry so many bags whenever i'm carrying the bags in from the car i wish that

27:26.000 --> 27:30.800
there were like big stair steps in front of me so i like the judges could judge how many stair

27:30.800 --> 27:35.680
steps i get up before i quit and like the lithuanian competitors that i could only do the

27:35.680 --> 27:42.400
three steps like that what was that it was a lithuanian accent griffin read a book you can't

27:42.400 --> 27:51.280
hear accents in books audiobooks uh i just love every part of it i love just being one and done

27:51.280 --> 27:55.840
i love like when someone gets in my way and i'm like get out of the way because i'm carrying so

27:55.840 --> 28:00.960
many bags and like that was rude but oh never mind he's got he does have a lot of bags i like

28:00.960 --> 28:05.280
the inspirational moment when my arms are completely weighed down and i've got two 12

28:05.280 --> 28:10.880
packs of soda and there's no way i could carry a single bag and then i realized i am not gonna

28:10.880 --> 28:16.400
walk all the way back out here to close the trunk no way on earth am i making another trip and i

28:16.400 --> 28:25.120
just dig deep digging that well that 127 hours well and just flex all my muscles available to

28:25.120 --> 28:30.560
me and like somehow fling the 12 pack up and let it use its weight to carry the trunk back

28:30.560 --> 28:34.800
to its closed position i'm also gonna be honest i also really like the moment when you're carrying

28:34.800 --> 28:39.200
those 12 packs and one of them like the handle starts to rip a little bit and you're like oh

28:39.200 --> 28:45.360
this is 24 now now the clock's a ticking i've only got like 30 seconds tops to get inside

28:45.360 --> 28:51.280
before all these cans go everywhere whenever i see whenever i see somebody with those new fangled

28:51.280 --> 28:55.840
cars or you kick the back bumper and it opens and closes the trunk i see them get their groceries

28:55.840 --> 29:00.800
out and just give it a little a little punt to shut the door i just look at them and i think you

29:01.600 --> 29:12.000
cuckold i don't think you're using that word correctly and i think i'm using it exactly

29:12.000 --> 29:20.240
correctly you cuckold shut it with your hands i once uh was uh pulling this trick helping uh

29:20.240 --> 29:27.200
my in-laws loaded some groceries in and uh my father-in-law is an an actual strong person

29:27.200 --> 29:31.040
and he was carrying a bunch of groceries so i thought well i'm gonna you know i want you to be

29:31.040 --> 29:37.440
impressed by the the the uh you know the spouse that your daughter has hitched her proverbial

29:37.440 --> 29:43.520
wagon to so i'm gonna haul in like a ton of groceries too and i had a 12 pack of diet sun

29:43.520 --> 29:52.560
kissed that the strong man's beverage i had 12 well it was theirs full of protein it's like his

29:52.560 --> 29:59.440
fave to drink and just bustle down and uh and i picked it up and i held the top of the 12 pack

29:59.440 --> 30:04.800
and it like ripped i had open as i was holding it and it was amazing because they have this like

30:04.800 --> 30:12.640
very steep driveway and the the kansas sun kids were just like and falling out and exploding as

30:12.640 --> 30:24.000
they hit the ground my strength potion how could you i need that strength potion to lift and he

30:24.000 --> 30:30.560
turned to dust before you're very hot no i can already feel my knees trying to lap so well my

30:30.560 --> 30:38.480
muscles are atrophying now i'm all noodly my strength potion my diet strength juice

30:43.760 --> 30:45.840
let's go to the money zone so i can buy my own street

30:45.840 --> 31:02.160
before we start this nature zone um in which we're talking about nature box griffin was

31:02.160 --> 31:08.880
telling us about the uh mouse sounds he edited out of our tortinos sponsored episode griffin

31:08.880 --> 31:13.520
did you save those tell me that somewhere there's an audio file on your computer just chained

31:13.520 --> 31:20.640
together uh uh eating noises no i did do that once when the three of us all this is if you're

31:20.640 --> 31:27.440
eating don't anymore ever again after hearing this but the three of us all had colds all at

31:27.440 --> 31:33.760
the same time and oh my god oh gee i edited them all together and it sounded like one of those like

31:34.560 --> 31:40.640
wind tunnels that they create for science to like test out the the you know strength and

31:40.640 --> 31:48.160
pliability of like industrial strength walls it was a oh man what a bad bad thing i don't know

31:48.160 --> 31:52.800
why i edited that together i used to have a strong fuck that was an evocative metaphor yeah nature

31:52.800 --> 31:58.880

37:36.160 --> 37:41.440
show elf it's like a 90 minute massage where the masseuse is two people talking to each other with

answers climbing that ladder climbing that ladder sent in by yahoo answers user james who asks

38:15.680 --> 38:23.200
ghostbusters question what happens if one of the ghostbusters dies and becomes a ghost

38:24.560 --> 38:29.600
holy shit here's a question i always had what happens if one of the ghostbusters

38:29.600 --> 38:34.640
dies and becomes a ghost do the other ghostbusters suck him up like they do with the other ghosts

38:34.640 --> 38:42.160
okay i would say that if they've made an arrangement with a ghost that's literally named

38:42.160 --> 38:51.120
slime yes that is defined by its sliming that that he can just like chill at their house yeah

38:51.920 --> 38:56.640
which is like by the way by the way okay if i just say okay just give me a second yeah by the way

38:56.640 --> 39:03.040
by the way by the way if i'm going in to procure the ghostbuster services which i'm assuming i'm

39:03.040 --> 39:09.200
doing at a premium once they become the toast of new york if i'm going in to procure their services

39:09.200 --> 39:14.400
and like i'm talking to janine i'm setting up a time for my uh consultation an estimate which

39:14.400 --> 39:19.680
i'm assuming they'll do for free uh i and i'm like setting that up and out of the corner of my eye

39:19.680 --> 39:26.240
i spy slimer like just jamming hot dogs down his throat let's fucking equate that if you were an

39:26.240 --> 39:30.960
exterminator and like people came in to hire you and there were just like rats hanging out on the

39:30.960 --> 39:37.600
floor that's not a good look not just rats hanging on the floor like a giant rat emitting green goo

39:37.600 --> 39:42.240
and eating hot dog and you were just like oh that's our rat that's ratty the rat he's our buddy

39:43.520 --> 39:51.840
like the grossest rat was slimer a pet or like was he sharing the office space like what i never

39:51.840 --> 39:57.840
quite understood because he had to be like the embodiment of a human being who had died like

39:57.840 --> 40:04.800
that's how ghosts work but he didn't seem to like speak english or have any human characteristics

40:04.800 --> 40:10.960
except that he was just kind of hungry all the time and terrible and yet he was the ghost that

40:10.960 --> 40:17.840
was allowed like free reign of the place yeah sure not like ghost around not like einstein

40:17.840 --> 40:26.880
or like gondi but slimer two things number one slimer was like on the cover of the ecto cooler

40:26.880 --> 40:33.120
box right and he was like right and the the juice was green are we to like i'm thinking about that

40:33.120 --> 40:37.760
now and i wish i'd never let that beverage cross between my lips and slip down my throat

40:40.080 --> 40:43.840
i always assumed it was slimer blood is it slimer milk

40:46.640 --> 40:52.960
did someone grasp his teats firmly but also ghostbusters themed jelly that was green

40:52.960 --> 40:59.600
green probably at some point i feel like there was ecto jelly they had teenager ninja turtles

40:59.600 --> 41:05.120
fruit pies that were green in them oh they were pudding pie green in the middle i guess just

41:05.120 --> 41:12.320
ground up turtles yeah i guess turtles i had two points and i did my first one and i forget

41:12.320 --> 41:20.160
what the second one was don't it always seem to go um uh do you okay slimer we can all okay let

41:20.160 --> 41:27.840
me ask this as a setup slimer was nasty right give me like like a headless ballroom dancer or

41:27.840 --> 41:33.680
something anything anything anything okay so i was nasty anybody anything right do you think

41:33.680 --> 41:38.880
there was ever a moment when one of the ghostbusters was using the bathroom and they

41:38.880 --> 41:44.880
just saw slimer's face like peek in expectantly like just wait because here's what i'm was there

41:44.880 --> 41:50.560
a moment when they were using the bathroom and they had to deal with slimer watching them waiting

41:50.560 --> 41:57.920
to go eat their bathroom this is what i'm that's what i'm what i'm wondering aloud that why would

41:57.920 --> 42:02.720
you wonder that internally why would you wonder that in any assets now everybody has to wonder

42:02.720 --> 42:08.320
okay good i think maybe this is i remembered my second thing if dogs do it there's no reality

42:08.320 --> 42:16.400
which dogs do it please do it even as the little ghost do it everybody's eating bathrooms you meet

42:16.400 --> 42:24.400
a nice girl or guy when you get one of your rare off nights from ghost busting and you go uh uh uh

42:24.400 --> 42:32.080
and up to the room things are going well and what is that mid coitus bursting through the like flying

42:32.080 --> 42:38.960
through the wall it's slimer and he's there to watch you fuck um i remembered my second point

42:39.840 --> 42:46.400
thank god maybe it's like michonne on the walking dead how she carried two two zombies around with

42:46.400 --> 42:51.840
her and so no zombies would mess her like ghosts would come by more listen simon's the worst

42:51.840 --> 42:58.240
aesthetically and um just sort of just sort of having him around it gives you a sense of unease

42:58.240 --> 43:01.920
and also there's all the slime that you have to deal with that's like a full-time job taking care

43:01.920 --> 43:09.040
of slimer um but he's not gonna he's not going to kill you he's not gonna he's not gonna you know uh

43:12.320 --> 43:17.760
he's not gonna inhabit a wolf and attack you right he's just slimer he's just gonna slime around

43:17.760 --> 43:24.640
so so a more malicious spirit a lesion comes by and is like what's up time to get spooky

43:24.640 --> 43:30.640
oh slimer you're already here sorry dog this one's yours later takes off oh so he's the devil you

43:30.640 --> 43:40.320
know yes is he the devil hold on i'm not saying the slimer is the devil but he's definitely of

43:40.320 --> 43:46.000
the devil it's never addressed in i don't think in any of the ghostbusters extended universe

43:46.000 --> 43:52.880
that there are ghosts that are not malicious except for slimer it is like the one chill ghost

43:52.880 --> 43:58.000
but no i would say that slimer is at least one percent malicious because like he eats your food

43:58.000 --> 44:03.600
and gets his detritus leavings all over everything so he's not exactly like benevolent

44:04.640 --> 44:09.760
but they don't seem to ever bust a ghost and then have someone say you busted my grandfather

44:09.760 --> 44:16.160
i didn't i didn't want that you turds there's one in the movies just a jogger he's just he's

44:16.160 --> 44:22.080
just trying to lose a couple ghost lbs and they bust him yeah they do they do and it's hard it's

44:22.080 --> 44:26.560
hard he's working hard out there because when you're a ghost your metabolism doesn't exist

44:26.560 --> 44:31.120
because you don't have a physical body yeah and in the song i always got so sick there's an

44:31.120 --> 44:36.640
invisible man sleeping in your bed who you're gonna call ghostbusters why it's an invisible man

44:36.640 --> 44:43.440
not a ghost too he's just napping he's a sleepy bag he's not bothering you he's not messing with

44:43.440 --> 44:50.720
your shit he's taking a fucking nap and you're gonna bust him mid nap mid nap you jerk my dog

44:50.720 --> 44:56.880
jumps on me sometimes when i'm sleeping and bust him setting bust that dog bust my dog

44:56.880 --> 45:03.040
goes murdering dogs makes you feel good i wish we could i wish you could see that moment when

45:03.040 --> 45:08.800
the ghostbusters are just circling your bed with their proton packs all loaded ready to blast then

45:08.800 --> 45:14.160
one of like egon looks at vancom and it's like does this feel wrong to you i'm having a crisis

45:14.160 --> 45:19.680
of conscience like i'm just gonna bust him like why he's not should we wake him up and see if

45:19.680 --> 45:24.720
he's like a jerk or something yeah should we try talking to him maybe just explain that like

45:24.720 --> 45:31.600
it's not his bed and he's like oh sorry i don't have eyeballs i'm invisible yeah hey by the way

45:31.600 --> 45:38.320
we um we have we have back at our house a living fart that emits goo everywhere do you think maybe

45:38.320 --> 45:43.920
the invisible man could stay with us like it probably wouldn't be that big of an inconvenience

45:43.920 --> 45:47.280
yeah oh so you're suggesting that there can only be one ghost at a time it goes

45:47.280 --> 45:55.520
busters hq so fucking vinkman dies and slimer's like well shit writing's on the wall yeah like

45:55.520 --> 46:00.880
if you want to keep one ghost mascot like wouldn't you upgrade to the invisible man who you don't

46:00.880 --> 46:07.280
have to see or think about you just know he's there at most he's napping in your bed at worst

46:08.640 --> 46:16.720
yeah for sure and not shitting his green slime all over your lunch i hope that there's some

46:16.720 --> 46:21.200
story joke in the new ghostbusters movie where slimer's like smokes weed or something

46:23.280 --> 46:30.880
why why would that be a thing it would be fun that'd be pretty funny it would be good

46:31.600 --> 46:37.760
i would get that on a t-shirt man i love slime i love slimer too i take back every mean thing i

46:37.760 --> 46:43.840
said about him i can't stop thinking about slimer it doesn't make sense do you think they tried to

46:43.840 --> 46:49.440
bust him and it just he was too fast they did justin in the first movie they bust him he's

46:49.440 --> 46:54.800
their first victim right and then they take him back and then he's just there and then he's like

46:54.800 --> 47:02.480
driving a bus what the fuck you professionally bust ghosts and he escaped he's the stupidest

47:02.480 --> 47:08.560
goat he's like he's the least he's the least of them he's the most trappable most trappable most

47:08.560 --> 47:16.240
he's the most travel and then he's driving a bus and rick moranis is just like okay cool what the

47:16.240 --> 47:24.880
fuck oh like after your entire city is in the thrall of vego and mood slime like do you really

47:24.880 --> 47:30.080
want to leave open any window to the paranormal like wouldn't you just insatiate like listen

47:30.080 --> 47:34.480
we've had a lot of fun with this ghost slimer but i think we really need to get serious about

47:34.480 --> 47:40.000
but there's not even a scene where they're like playing checkers with slimer going on a beach

47:40.000 --> 47:44.240
vacation with slimer he's like catching a frisbee in his mouth he's just there he's just a shitty

47:44.240 --> 47:49.040
roommate although i do i do not want to see a scene where everyone's like having fun with slimy

47:49.040 --> 47:52.640
right then they all leave the room and he just turns and looks in the mirror and his eyes like

47:52.640 --> 48:00.880
blaze red as blood like drips from his mouth and then he smacks my knife and he smokes a huge pile

48:00.880 --> 48:06.640
of weed maybe slimer is the only one of the ghostbusters team that knows where to get

48:06.640 --> 48:16.720
weed well hold on let's not be too hasty i've got i've got my uh my uh chronic vego ain't

48:16.720 --> 48:25.120
gonna smoke us out gozer ain't gonna smoke us out slimer he's not a great roommate he's a

48:25.120 --> 48:33.920
gatekeeper not the not the weed haver what do you think oscar's gonna get us some weed he's a baby

48:33.920 --> 48:37.760
does he make sense he's in school right now he can't get us well actually he probably would

48:37.760 --> 48:42.000
have to hook up schools today it would be a really nice call back if they cast the baby

48:42.000 --> 48:46.480
that played oscar as slimer in the next movie don't you think that would be a nice call back

48:46.480 --> 48:52.960
do you think slimer i'll have kids in the next movie he's been sliming all over town justin

48:52.960 --> 49:01.440
you know what i mean you gotta pay the piper wear a condom slimer where where would he put it

49:01.440 --> 49:08.400
on his everything what happened to sliver didn't you guys used to have a ghost here uh this is a

49:08.400 --> 49:11.600
scene for the next movie okay what happened to sliver did you guys used to have a ghost to live

49:11.600 --> 49:18.560
here well he got too old and he died that's what happens to ghost and then sliver like peeks up

49:18.560 --> 49:27.840
through the floor just kidding ah it's me slimer i can talk now i sound a lot like harvey feisty

49:29.200 --> 49:35.520
slimer what a character what a what a great what a great character slimer is

49:35.520 --> 49:46.240
do you think he had a room or do you think they just like made him float

49:46.240 --> 49:52.320
like just like he probably doesn't sleep so what's he doing during the night just

49:52.320 --> 49:57.040
sitting down in the office by himself just waits he's like the the dog in

49:57.040 --> 50:02.160
futurama just waiting for them to wake up i'll see you guys in the morning i guess

50:02.160 --> 50:07.520
anybody want to sit around play this is a sad lonely existence for slimer because he loves

50:07.520 --> 50:13.360
them right and they love tolerate him right at most at best can one of you can one of you guys

50:13.360 --> 50:18.000
turn the tv on just so i can have something to watch some white noise or something just leave

50:18.000 --> 50:26.960
on in pr my big so lonely my big mushy fingers can't work the remote so lonely so cold so dead

50:26.960 --> 50:33.520
i i was married when i was alive i had kids i was i was the mayor it's like the dread pirate

50:33.520 --> 50:38.000
robber it's every night they're like good night slimer sleep well uh would like to bust you in

50:38.000 --> 50:43.040
the morning like he he's on concert if he leaves the refrigerator open one of them might get a

50:43.040 --> 50:49.360
wild hair and just bust him i would like to bust him often and then just let him back out to be

50:49.360 --> 50:55.840
like just remember we could leave you in there anytime fuck i fly right turn it around right

50:55.840 --> 50:59.520
the ghostbusters obviously it's insane that they have a ghost that lives at their house

50:59.520 --> 51:05.920
it's crazy this is a debate team that point has been executed that that point is what's wrong

51:05.920 --> 51:11.920
with slimer that of all the world that he could haunt he haunts the building full of people that

51:11.920 --> 51:16.080
could kill him it's like he's got stockholm syndrome at this point it's real it's really

51:16.080 --> 51:21.120
what it is he should haunt anywhere else like where people are exclusively devoted to busting

51:21.120 --> 51:28.400
him on some level slimer believes he deserves to be busted he does he wants to be busted it's his

51:28.400 --> 51:34.800
fetish it's the only way he can feel he's been a ghost for 453 years right in my fan fiction

51:34.800 --> 51:40.400
and the only way that he can feel now is to be busted 50 shades of close to being busted like

51:40.400 --> 51:45.200
dancing the razor's edge of being busted yeah so that's why he's being such a shitty roommate he's

51:45.200 --> 51:52.080
not a bad guy but he needs to antagonize him just enough so that they bust him a little you maybe

51:52.080 --> 51:58.640
could say that busting makes him feel good exactly maybe he likes the smug sense of superiority he

51:58.640 --> 52:06.080
gets every time they drag in a trap full of another guy he's like a bitch he's out there

52:06.080 --> 52:10.480
he's got his ear to the ground he's their confidential informer he's got his ear to the

52:10.480 --> 52:16.720
ground his his ectoplasm ear and then he's like i hear there's a ghost down on 53 in maine who's

52:16.720 --> 52:21.840
jogging and they're like we'll get him slimer and that's how he stays out he is a traitor to his

52:21.840 --> 52:26.400
people maybe the reason he can't like he has to stay with him is no ghosts will have him no

52:27.040 --> 52:32.800
he burned those riches no those bridges are gone maybe it's just because other ghosts would beat

52:32.800 --> 52:38.000
the hell out of him like he's a he's not safe there he can do he can listen if you need a

52:38.000 --> 52:43.840
prank done slime is your guy oh what if it's like what if it's like animals like if you feed the

52:43.840 --> 52:49.040
like wild animals and they become like oh now now they'll starve to death because now they're just

52:49.040 --> 52:53.120
so used to people like feeding them cheetos that they don't know how to hunt anymore slimer has

52:53.120 --> 52:57.680
become like domesticated he wouldn't survive out in the wild he doesn't know how to haunt anymore

52:58.320 --> 53:04.560
like he just he doesn't have the chops he couldn't spook anybody couldn't spook a fly let me hit you

53:04.560 --> 53:13.840
too with this idea ashton kutcher and slimer in prank house and they're roommates and they live

53:13.840 --> 53:20.080
together and slimer comes home from work and ashton's bedroom door's open so slimer goes in

53:20.080 --> 53:25.200
he opens it up kutcher's making love to a young hollywood starlet he looks up and yells gotcha

53:25.200 --> 53:30.480
and then slimer says oh did you and then ashton kutcher looks down and it's not a young hollywood

53:30.480 --> 53:37.200
starlet he's making love to it's a big pile of slime roll credits roll credits roll title screen
