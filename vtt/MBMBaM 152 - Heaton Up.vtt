00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.560
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era. My name

00:48.560 --> 00:54.080
is Justin McElroy, and I've brought the two of you here because I have some big news.

00:54.080 --> 01:02.400
Hit me with your rhythm stick. I am going to be a mother. Justin.

01:04.240 --> 01:09.840
I am. God, so many emotions running through my mind and my heart right now. I'm flabbergasted.

01:09.840 --> 01:14.960
I would say the overwhelming emotional feeling is confusion. Is confusion an emotion?

01:14.960 --> 01:18.880
I have a lot of that, but it's overridden slightly by excitement.

01:18.880 --> 01:28.640
Thanks, Trudy. Mainly I'm bringing this up. I waited until today. Obviously, I just want you

01:28.640 --> 01:35.200
guys to treat me super special today. Just really super duper special. How far along are you?

01:38.400 --> 01:41.680
Four or five, I feel like. You're four or five along?

01:41.680 --> 01:45.360
Which trimester is that? I think it's one of them,

01:45.360 --> 01:50.720
definitely. One of the big ones that everybody really likes to have. Have you been practicing,

01:51.920 --> 02:00.480
you know, Pilates? Spreading it. Kegels? Pilates, Kegels. Here's the secret. You don't want to do

02:00.480 --> 02:05.920
Kegels. You do not want it tight down there. You want it limber. You want it loose. You want to do

02:05.920 --> 02:11.360
anti-Kegels. You want to be loosey. You know, I had an anti-Kegel once. You know, I had a

02:11.360 --> 02:17.200
spaceship powered by anti-Kegels. Really? Yeah, it was the logistical improbability of them

02:17.200 --> 02:22.240
was enough to make the ship go. Listen, guys, I just really, the main thing for me is that you

02:22.240 --> 02:27.040
just treat me really nice. And even if on the off chance I never bring up being a mother again,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.080
can't imagine that happening. Now, Justin, what would you say to your haters that might accuse

02:32.080 --> 02:40.960
you of just trying to capitalize on the Mother's Day attention? Gosh, that is so like the younger

02:40.960 --> 02:50.080
generation, you know? Yeah. You know, the kids, they're just all, they're all plugged in. And

02:50.080 --> 02:58.000
I'm really, part of being a mom that you have to understand, Travis, I suspect, is that when the

02:58.000 --> 03:06.240
young, when the younger generation doesn't, basically where there was one set of footprints

03:06.240 --> 03:12.640
in the sand is where I carry them. Okay. So there's, it's all jealousy, right? Like that time

03:12.640 --> 03:17.680
article on millennials, like it really, it touches on that point a lot how this, this generation of

03:17.680 --> 03:23.520
human beings doesn't have the male uterus. You know what I mean? They can't carry, men can't

03:23.520 --> 03:28.880
carry a human being to term in this particular generation. That's right. I do not know why.

03:28.880 --> 03:35.440
It's like children of men. Literally, it's exactly literally like children of men. Oh my God, what if

03:35.440 --> 03:40.160
they did a sequel to that movie and they did a mashup with that, with Junior, with the Arnold

03:40.160 --> 03:45.040
Schwarzenegger movie where he gets pregnant? That would be, that's how I'm a mom. I meant to tell you

03:45.040 --> 03:50.160
also, I have Junior disease. You saw the movie or whatever it was. He's got Junior disease.

03:50.800 --> 03:56.960
I have Junior, Junior disease that makes a baby throw at you. I got Junior. I caught secondhand

03:56.960 --> 04:04.000
Junior from watching my laser. I was watching my laser disc of Junior and I caught secondhand Junior

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
and now I'm a male mom, a manther, if you will. Is that like a panther? I won't. It's like a panther.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.120
Well, if my cubs are in danger, it is. My babies, my single baby, maybe two babies. Oh, I'm a single

04:19.120 --> 04:24.160
baby. Justin, is it disheartening though? Cause you've lost so much weight this year that you're

04:24.160 --> 04:29.520
just going to put on. Just putting it right back on that baby fat. Well, it's important. It's, you

04:29.520 --> 04:35.280
know, I won't mind knowing that my baby is just reaching up with his fat little fetus hand and

04:35.280 --> 04:39.600
grabbing globules of that fat and eating it for nourishment. I won't feel so bad about it. I want

04:39.600 --> 04:44.160
him to have a good food supply. That is how, that is how it works. It's like a bowl weevil in a

04:44.160 --> 04:48.160
watermelon. Just emptying it out. It's like James, you got, it's basically a James and the Giant

04:48.160 --> 04:55.440
Peach scenario. Yeah. I'd like to make a name recommendation, please. Baby fat. Okay. It's a

04:55.440 --> 05:02.560
little unknown. You're saying that you're saying the thing that it is to you biologically speaking

05:02.560 --> 05:07.520
in a biological context, that baby is nothing but an extra eight pounds that you have to,

05:07.520 --> 05:13.920
that you have to transport for a while. I think it fits. So make sure the two of you,

05:13.920 --> 05:18.800
did you introduce yourselves? I mean, obviously it's not our special, it's not our special day.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.320
You know what I mean? I would prefer you did not introduce yourselves. If that's,

05:22.320 --> 05:26.160
if that's, that's fine. Yeah. It's your, it's we can give you that from other stuff.

05:26.160 --> 05:31.600
Yeah. Thank you. Uh, let's, uh, let's do, I do want to help other people though.

05:31.600 --> 05:37.040
And that's really what being a mom's all about for me is just, gosh, just never stop it. It's

05:37.040 --> 05:42.240
like being, it's just being pecked to death by ducks, right? It's like being pecked to death

05:42.240 --> 05:49.440
by ducks. How do I respond to complainers? I often find myself at the receiving end of some sort of

05:49.440 --> 05:54.240
rant. People were accounting bad customer service experiences, ways their friends have slighted

05:54.240 --> 05:58.880
them and so on. What's the best way to react? Complaining is a pet peeve of mine, but I don't

05:58.880 --> 06:04.160
want to be rude. Do I agree with them? Stay neutral. I try to be noncommittal and let them vent,

06:04.160 --> 06:08.640
but I'm worried my annoyance shows through. What should I do? That's from complained out

06:08.640 --> 06:15.200
incarnation. It's a nice name for a town carnation. It is nice. It is nice. Um,

06:15.200 --> 06:20.800
too bad everything sucks there. Apparently carnation, the negativity capital of the world.

06:20.800 --> 06:26.320
I, yeah, apparently everybody's grumped. I'm right there with this part. They're not, oh God,

06:26.320 --> 06:32.800
nobody gives a shit. Nobody gives a shit about the poor service you received unless it's hilarious.

06:32.800 --> 06:38.240
Yeah, that's, that's sort of my MO is I, I seriously, I never complain unless I can like

06:38.240 --> 06:44.880
tie some sort of entertainment. Like I want people to hear about how hard my life is, but I know that

06:44.880 --> 06:52.000
I don't want to put upon them the, the boring ass stuff that people have done to slight me. So I'll

06:52.000 --> 06:56.640
work a goof in there or two. You know what I mean? Even if you have to make one up, because also I

06:56.640 --> 07:00.240
find, especially when it comes to like customer service things and stuff, someone's going to be

07:00.240 --> 07:05.840
like, and she, it took like 10 minutes to get it done. Like all I'm sitting there thinking is,

07:05.840 --> 07:09.920
well, maybe it was a really complicated thing or they were really busy and you're just whining

07:09.920 --> 07:14.000
for no reason. Like there's always a certain amount of like perspective on it that makes the

07:14.000 --> 07:20.640
person seem just like a whiner. You should tell them, you should make them watch. This is water

07:20.640 --> 07:27.920
is this video I watched or any, any, any number of, of Netflix documentaries. How about dear,

07:27.920 --> 07:33.440
how about dear Zachary? Oh man. Oh shit. Oh man. They served me my coffee and it was lukewarm when

07:33.440 --> 07:40.960
it got to the table. Oh man. Well, at least your dad's alive. You should keep a, you should keep

07:40.960 --> 07:48.720
a series of pictures in your pocket at all times of like the Chilean miners emerging or like that

07:48.720 --> 07:56.320
lady they saved from the rebel, rebel of the Bangladesh factory after being buried alive for

07:56.320 --> 08:03.200
14 days or what have you just slow as their story continues, just slowly start edging it up over the

08:03.200 --> 08:10.080
lip of the table. Just slow. Oh, you can do a little fun little, you can do a little fun little

08:10.080 --> 08:16.000
thing where you pretend that is the Chilean miners emerging, emerging from below and be like, Oh,

08:16.800 --> 08:21.440
and you can do like a fun voice. You can do like a fun voice like, Oh, you had to wait at the DMV

08:21.440 --> 08:28.240
for how long we waited in the underground frigid caverns, which is like a DMV, I guess.

08:28.880 --> 08:34.240
Did you just curious, did you have to eat your underwear at any point? Was that part of your,

08:34.240 --> 08:40.320
no. Okay. All right. We're the tiny Chilean miners that live under this table and we're here to tell

08:40.320 --> 08:48.480
you that you need to chill the fuck out. Um, yeah, there's no, you don't think any

08:48.480 --> 08:53.680
complainers listen to our podcast, do you? No. Well, no, I know for a fact some do.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.440
Anytime the goofs, the goofs get a little dry. When the goofs fall fast. We might get an email

09:01.440 --> 09:07.120
from a Chilean miner. We go to the old goof well sometimes there ain't nothing but dust in there.

09:07.120 --> 09:12.160
And man, do we ever hear about it? Well, it's like being a farmer and people saying that you

09:12.160 --> 09:15.760
got spots in your tomatoes when you're in the market. Like, I know it's been a dry season.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.720
We need to start replying to those tweets, pictures of the Chilean miners.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.800
From now on, if you complain about our show, that's what you get. You get a JPEG, a low res

09:26.800 --> 09:32.880
JPEG of the Chilean miners. They would have loved that entertainment. Even the bad episodes,

09:32.880 --> 09:37.840
they would love it. They would conquer the language barrier. I think they would connect

09:37.840 --> 09:40.960
with something. Well, they could listen to the Spanish language version of her. The guy that

09:40.960 --> 09:50.880
does Travis's voice is out of control. That's Travis because he's eating two hamburgers.

09:50.880 --> 09:57.120
Necesito un bocadillo. I mean, I need a big sandwich.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.720
Exactly. All of these things are things that Travis has said today,

10:00.720 --> 10:06.240
and it's 10.14 in the morning. Travis has eaten two hamburgers and a giant sandwich,

10:06.240 --> 10:10.400
and it's 10.14 in the morning. Yo soy Alphonse.

10:10.400 --> 10:23.760
That's one of the few sentences I know. That's not even the Fonz's classic catchphrase.

10:23.760 --> 10:27.600
He often would just go places and state for a fact that he was the Fonz.

10:27.600 --> 10:36.560
Hello, yes, I am the Fonz. Hey, let me just bump this soda machine real quick. Oh, hurt my elbow.

10:36.560 --> 10:42.400
I would love to watch an episode where Fonz was ineffectual.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.560
He's actually trying to get a table at Arnold's, and he just has to loudly announce,

10:48.560 --> 10:55.520
I am the Fonz. Can I drop a truth bomb on you guys real quick? Something I want to think about.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.120
Sure. Okay, so welcome to Travis's Pondering Corner.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.400
Oh god, is it going to be entertaining at all, or is this something I'm just going to have to

11:02.400 --> 11:09.120
edit out of the show? I think so. Okay. If you hear 40 seconds of silence, you know what happens.

11:09.760 --> 11:14.240
As I was listening, as I was going through the emails last night, we got an email from Robin,

11:14.240 --> 11:21.360
and Robin made an excellent point that we have a tendency to use phrases like man up or nut up or

11:22.320 --> 11:25.200
something along those lines. I don't think I say nut up ever.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.760
I don't think I've ever said nut up. What about sack up?

11:27.760 --> 11:30.480
No, these are all things I don't think I'd say. Grow a dick?

11:30.480 --> 11:37.280
Grow a dick? Grow a dick is something I've never even heard Fled Lode said.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.840
So, the phrase man up. I do think it's kind of funny.

11:41.840 --> 11:46.160
I don't like these phrases anymore, and so now I was thinking about it,

11:46.160 --> 11:50.160
and I came up with a phrase that I would like to enter into the lexicon to start using.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.400
Okay. Power up.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.960
Power up? Yeah, so when someone's like,

11:54.960 --> 11:58.800
I want to ask a girl out, but I'm too nervous, you say power up and do it.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.440
Can we say power up? What about genitals?

12:01.440 --> 12:04.320
How about genitals up? Or just-

12:04.320 --> 12:05.600
Ginny up. Gin's up.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.280
Gin's up, everybody. What's wrong?

12:09.920 --> 12:13.200
What about Ginny up? I like Ginny up because that says,

12:13.200 --> 12:15.760
no matter what your genitals are, just find them.

12:16.480 --> 12:21.520
Just find the power of your vagina or penis. Ginny up.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.920
I kind of like Ginny up. Ginny up, everybody.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.320
All right, that's in it now. Let's get it on some shirts.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.960
Let's t-shirt it. T-shirt it.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.640
Tweet it, Facebook it. But I'm afraid to Facebook it.

12:30.640 --> 12:35.200
Our Deedles campaign did not catch on. Because I edited it out completely.

12:35.200 --> 12:41.360
I edited every utterance of Deedles from the last episode completely out of the show.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.920
You freed the Deedles from the Disney vault campaign, you edited it out?

12:45.920 --> 12:49.200
Yeah, and I'm going to get it this time too. You're terrible.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.760
No, it's way better if you leave it in this time.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.320
Okay, I'll leave it in this time. To let people think about what might have been.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.960
To let people know that the fucking Dead Sea Scrolls of episode 151

12:58.960 --> 13:02.400
buried in a cave somewhere where we talk about the hit Disney film Meet the Deedles.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.000
Free the Deedles.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.280
Free the Deedles. Hashtag Deedles.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.080
Good, good, good comedy. Do you guys want a Yahoo?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.400
Please, anything.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.000
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.480
It's Drew. It's by Yahoo. It's user Nick who asks,

13:20.480 --> 13:23.920
My mom took my swag. How do I steal it back?

13:28.400 --> 13:31.920
Yeah, like a month ago, my mom caught me chiefing a cig.

13:33.120 --> 13:38.960
She then took all my snapbacks and proceeded to tell me that she took my swag.

13:39.840 --> 13:44.160
At first it seemed a little stupid, but now I no longer feel the urge to smoke cigs

13:44.160 --> 13:50.560
or wear bulls' snapbacks. How do I steal the swag back?

13:50.560 --> 13:51.040
Hold on.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.880
A snapback is a type of hat with a basketball logo on it.

13:54.880 --> 13:55.360
Thank you.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.720
I Google image searched it.

13:57.600 --> 13:57.920
Thank you very much.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.360
And what is chiefing a cig?

13:59.920 --> 14:04.640
That is when you smoke a cigarette with your butt. No, I'm just kidding. I don't know.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.680
I assume it's smoking. It's just a cool thing that we don't know about because we're old now.

14:10.720 --> 14:10.960
Okay.

14:10.960 --> 14:15.760
Okay. So you've never heard of like having having a chief having a chief.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.480
Oh, I'm I'm going to step outside of this bar and just have a chief.

14:19.120 --> 14:19.280
No.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.240
Have a have a long chief or a chuff.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.480
Can I get a chief off your your cigarette friend?

14:26.480 --> 14:28.560
No, you can have no chiefs.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.720
Um, kind of achieve his mom is like his mom is like mentalist in him, right?

14:33.440 --> 14:37.120
I don't even know. I don't know what he has ever watched the mentalist.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.480
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:38.480 --> 14:43.120
Sorry, you guys. Lots of people have watched the mentalist me 40 year old women.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.320
Lots of people.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.080
So can you explain what you mean though?

14:46.800 --> 14:51.760
Mentalist thing is when the mentalist says a word or phrase and you're like,

14:51.760 --> 14:54.400
uh, whatever, but then it creeps in your consciousness.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.960
And like two days later you call him back and you're like,

14:56.960 --> 14:58.240
yeah, I'm ready to tell you everything.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.000
You need to that's inception.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.480
That's it.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.360
Call it inception.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.200
That's a way bigger blockbuster smash.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.440
Inception happens in dreams.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.360
You guys mentalist thing happens in real life.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.200
Did you guys see that Christopher Nolan movie?

15:11.200 --> 15:11.840
It came back.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.240
It came out a few years ago because I saw it in Chicago.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.520
That was like 2011.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.800
It was called Mentalisters.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.880
It was called Mentalisters.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.400
And it was about people who mentalist each other by going into their psyches.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.400
I'm just tired of Travis trying to gerund every CBS series.

15:26.400 --> 15:26.800
I know.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.760
He tried to do so.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.080
He tried to get Survivoring going forever.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.040
That didn't work out.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.000
He tried to get NCIS Los Angeles thing going.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.440
That did not work out.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.240
I'm just sick of it.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.120
I want you guys to know that I've actually just mentalistic you.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.240
And like two weeks from now someone will say something like,

15:44.240 --> 15:45.200
oh, like mentalist thing.

15:47.200 --> 15:53.680
Travis, you are not the origin of nearly as many zeitgeists as you think you are.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.760
Maybe I am.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.000
Okay.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.480
In two weeks we're going to realize that Travis is the origin of every zeitgeist.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.520
Two possible scenarios for this situation.

16:05.520 --> 16:10.720
Either the mom took his swag away to punish him.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.760
Or because she's trying to rekindle the flame of her youth.

16:16.800 --> 16:22.240
Trying to fucking throw on some snapbacks and chief a few puffers.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.360
I see.

16:24.320 --> 16:27.280
So mom wants mom wants swag for a day.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.640
Mom wants the feels.

16:28.640 --> 16:34.480
Oh my god, the new ABC Family hit movie, Swag for a Day.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.320
I was going to say Patricia Heaton.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.040
How did you know?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.440
Because I mentalist-ed you.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.600
Oh god damn it.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.120
The middle ding ding us.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.560
Yeah, it's Patricia Heaton.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.320
She takes her son's cigs, takes his bulls cap, throws it on.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.720
Goes to the mall, smokes in the mall.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.720
Security guard's like, you can't smoke in a mall.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.600
She's like, I can.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.240
I gave birth.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.240
And then, because I'm a mother.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.360
And then he's like, I think I love you.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.400
And then they fall in love.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.720
It's a prequel to the middle.

17:11.680 --> 17:17.920
We also on this program, I'm trying desperately to picture this scenario, this movie.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.600
Mainly so I can remember it later.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.680
And write it down and sell it.

17:21.680 --> 17:28.880
But we on this show have proven ourselves incapable of distinguishing Patricia Heaton

17:28.880 --> 17:31.840
from the mom on Home Improvement.

17:31.840 --> 17:36.480
We used, we have on many occasions used these two women interchangeably.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.080
Who is the mom on Home Improvement?

17:38.080 --> 17:40.320
Patricia Cheefin.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.920
The evil twin of Patricia Heaton.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.040
Or the good twin.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.360
I've heard some negative things about Patricia Heaton.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.400
Patricia Richardson.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.280
Okay, see, these are not the same women.

17:53.280 --> 17:58.960
Even though every other sign would point to them being the same person.

17:58.960 --> 18:03.680
Well, one is a, sorry, one is a complete neocon psychopath.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.360
Wait, really?

18:05.360 --> 18:05.600
Yeah.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.120
Which one?

18:07.120 --> 18:10.560
Patricia Heaton, I would say, is not a friend to the gay community.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.480
You're kidding me.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.760
I just saw her yesterday.

18:15.760 --> 18:16.800
She seemed so nice.

18:16.800 --> 18:22.080
But Griffin, everybody loves Gaiman.

18:23.680 --> 18:28.880
Oh my god, did you guys know that the BBC ordered an everybody loves Raymond remake?

18:31.280 --> 18:33.040
Everyone cares deeply for Raymond.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.160
Let's get back to the heart of the matter.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.440
By the way, this question was posted in Etiquette.

18:41.440 --> 18:47.600
This is a proper, polite way of asking my mom for my swag back.

18:49.600 --> 18:53.760
I don't think you can, I don't think the hat doesn't make the swag.

18:53.760 --> 18:54.880
I think we all know that, right?

18:55.920 --> 18:58.320
No, no, it helps.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.960
It does help, but it is a swag modifier.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.280
But the swag has to bloom from within.

19:03.280 --> 19:08.800
Right, the swag starts in your heart when you accept Jesus Christ into your life.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.840
Mm-hmm, and you accept his love and forgiveness for all your-

19:11.840 --> 19:14.720
You got a swag filled hole that only Jesus can fill.

19:14.720 --> 19:14.960
Right.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.360
Jesus is the ultimate swag.

19:17.360 --> 19:25.040
You look at like 2 Chainz, Feral, Feral, have you heard this rapper Feral?

19:27.200 --> 19:31.360
He has a sample on the Daft Punk track, and it's just him eating a deer.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.760
We're up all night to eat garbage.

19:33.760 --> 19:39.760
We're up all night to bite babies.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.760
We're up all night to foam at the mouth.

19:43.520 --> 19:48.560
We can't pay Daft Punk any more royalties for that song, unfortunately.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.240
Yeah, next question, here we go.

19:50.240 --> 19:57.120
At in my, oh, man, if this was at Mother's Day, you guys would have given me such a hard time

19:57.120 --> 19:59.120
for missing that read up.

19:59.120 --> 19:59.920
Here, let me try again.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.800
At my college, there is a girl I really like.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.240
I met her once at the beginning of the semester, but didn't get her name,

20:06.240 --> 20:09.120
and recently saw her in the library and approached her.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.000
Besides coming off a bit strong, I don't really like her.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.240
We got on well, and I asked her if we could have coffee sometime, to which she agreed.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.960
She then added me on Facebook.

20:19.600 --> 20:24.560
When I checked out her profile, though, it said she was interested in women, not men.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.800
Should I trust this and give up on her?

20:26.800 --> 20:30.880
Advances of romance or ask her out and hope for the best?

20:31.440 --> 20:34.480
That's from confused Facebooker in Bandura.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.920
We are, I don't know, guys, about this one.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.160
We are so unqualified.

20:42.160 --> 20:46.480
We are on perhaps the thinnest ice of our career on this one.

20:46.480 --> 20:50.000
I, I'm willing to skate on it and just plunge right through.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.440
Well, yeah, can I just, this feels like a stumper to me.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.720
Can I just, this feels like a stumper to me.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.760
This feels like I'm-

20:57.760 --> 21:00.880
I'm worried that we may say something accidentally that will

21:00.880 --> 21:04.400
make this episode palatable only to Patricia Heaton, if that makes sense.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.000
No, I mean, like, I don't, I mean, I really, I honestly,

21:08.000 --> 21:14.960
I feel like I've reached the event horizon of my, my ability to put myself into a situation.

21:14.960 --> 21:18.080
There are just so many twists and turns on this one.

21:18.080 --> 21:18.960
I don't, I don't know.

21:18.960 --> 21:25.680
Let's, let's start with the, with some of the codified parameters of this question.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.920
Let's start with some of the heuristics.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.840
For instance, on Facebook, it says she's interested in women, but for what?

21:31.840 --> 21:33.280
You know, for friendship?

21:33.280 --> 21:34.240
For companionship?

21:34.240 --> 21:39.040
Because that's, that is a possibility to checkmark on Facebook, but probably not.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.360
Probably not at all.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.560
Probably not that at all.

21:43.760 --> 21:48.720
Okay, I'm going to say this, and because this is a zone of friendship and safety,

21:48.720 --> 21:50.240
as all internet is.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.720
No, we are in the fucking danger zone right now.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.200
This is our fucking Kobayashi Maru, Travis.

21:56.640 --> 22:01.840
What ruined this was about like, uh, six or eight years ago.

22:02.640 --> 22:07.120
This really stupid trend of people claiming they were married to their best friends.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.320
You're saying that this person put that as their Facebook status as a goof

22:12.320 --> 22:13.760
and then forgot to change it.

22:13.760 --> 22:14.400
No, no, no.

22:14.400 --> 22:19.200
I'm saying that it muddied the water and made it, made people unable to trust

22:19.200 --> 22:20.640
what they see on Facebook.

22:22.320 --> 22:22.560
Okay.

22:22.560 --> 22:26.000
Because there was this seed planted eight years ago of like,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.640
well, people joke around on Facebook all the time.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.120
Okay, I know, I do know what Travis is saying.

22:31.120 --> 22:36.480
I don't know that that's, I mean, I don't know that that's particularly helpful.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.480
No, I don't think so either, but I'm saying there's no,

22:39.040 --> 22:42.240
that's what allows someone to see that interested in women and go,

22:42.240 --> 22:47.520
yeah, but maybe not like it's, it's a crazy thing to think, but that's why.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.720
Well, but I mean, you're right, Travis.

22:50.720 --> 22:55.200
Like I, I recently had to update my Facebook page

22:55.200 --> 22:59.040
to remove some likes that I put on there in like 2004.

22:59.040 --> 23:04.480
I had to, I had to manually delete some Rotten Tomatoes Facebook reviews

23:04.480 --> 23:07.120
I had written about hit films like Garden State,

23:07.120 --> 23:10.880
or I had to talk about how meaningful it was to me.

23:12.560 --> 23:18.240
I had to, I had to manually delete my review of the time machine,

23:18.240 --> 23:20.160
the hit film, the time machine, the remake.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.960
So yes, Travis, I feel, I feel you, I do feel you,

23:26.960 --> 23:31.440
but I think that most people have made the switch.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.640
Most people made the jump.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.920
I'm sure that most people's info is probably pretty accurate.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.200
Now let's say this though.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.880
Maybe, maybe you should adjust your expectations.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.720
You should definitely adjust your expectation.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.840
That doesn't mean you can't, you know, hang out with this person.

23:47.840 --> 23:48.240
Yeah.

23:48.240 --> 23:51.040
Obviously hang out with them.

23:51.040 --> 23:51.840
See what happens.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.640
Not, no, don't see what happens.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.800
Don't, don't see what happens.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.080
Just hang out with them.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.120
Cause you like them.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.080
Just hang out with them and use your like,

24:04.080 --> 24:08.400
like just use your heart and try to keep your head on a swivel

24:08.400 --> 24:10.480
and see if you could assess your situation.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.760
I feel like, cause my impulse was to tell this person

24:14.320 --> 24:17.840
that they should, that they should ask,

24:17.840 --> 24:21.040
like just bring it up and have a conversation about it.

24:21.040 --> 24:25.280
But like literally that's a real, that's a real do as I say,

24:25.280 --> 24:26.320
not as I do moment.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.480
Cause I would not have that conversation

24:28.480 --> 24:30.320
if I was not equipped with a jet pack.

24:30.320 --> 24:34.320
If you didn't have one of those things that they use

24:34.320 --> 24:36.880
for special effects on action movies that rip you back.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.840
I need a guy to say at any moment to like,

24:41.840 --> 24:43.840
oh, he's out, he's out, he's out.

24:43.840 --> 24:44.560
Pull him out.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.200
You need some kind of like a communicator device to say,

24:47.200 --> 24:50.080
I need an extraction and then you're gone.

24:50.080 --> 24:50.400
Yeah.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.360
I need, I basically need the team from Armageddon

24:53.360 --> 24:54.640
to like lower me in.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.280
Yeah, but I don't know.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.200
Just, I mean, I would give this,

25:01.200 --> 25:05.520
regardless of the sexual orientation or gender

25:05.520 --> 25:08.400
of anybody in this situation,

25:08.400 --> 25:12.000
I would say don't, just don't go into it thinking like

25:13.440 --> 25:15.200
tonight, tonight's the night.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.920
I'm finally gonna, it's finally gonna happen for me.

25:17.920 --> 25:21.280
Sexually speaking, just go into it saying

25:21.280 --> 25:23.040
I'm gonna have a good time with this person.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.000
I'm gonna meet somebody.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.120
I'm gonna get to know people.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.520
Maybe we'll maybe end up being best friends.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.880
Maybe we'll end up being best friends.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.520
Maybe that Facebook status is false

25:32.480 --> 25:34.160
and maybe it'll be more than that.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.360
But I don't know.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.560
I would be uncomfortable canceling any plans based on that

25:40.560 --> 25:42.080
because then you're being a real heathen.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.360
You just gotta ginny up

25:45.360 --> 25:47.920
and you gotta just have a frank conversation with this person.

25:48.480 --> 25:48.960
I agree.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.080
It doesn't have to be frank, like walk in the room,

25:52.080 --> 25:53.920
go, so what's the deal?

25:53.920 --> 25:54.160
Yeah.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.480
You can just, it can come up in conversation

25:56.480 --> 25:57.600
as you're talking about, you know,

25:57.600 --> 25:59.120
that getting to know you stuff, you know,

25:59.120 --> 26:02.400
like, you know, so you seeing anybody,

26:02.400 --> 26:04.240
you know, that kind of stuff, you know,

26:04.240 --> 26:05.280
let it just kind of come up.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.200
I don't think so you seeing anybody

26:09.200 --> 26:11.360
is a great question to ask on a date.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.640
Not in the first 10.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.040
Well, okay, oh, you're right.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.120
Cause if it's a date, if she thinks it's a date,

26:17.840 --> 26:20.000
if she thinks it's a, do you see what I'm saying right now?

26:20.000 --> 26:23.120
Like, I think the only way that this person,

26:23.120 --> 26:25.520
like I think actually the only approach to this

26:25.520 --> 26:28.000
is to pretend you never saw it

26:28.000 --> 26:29.120
and just try to live your life.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.000
This is, but okay, but we can use this.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.400
This can be actionable advice for everybody else.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.800
If you are dating, if you're going on a date

26:36.800 --> 26:38.400
with somebody, you're interested in somebody,

26:38.400 --> 26:40.000
don't fucking Facebook them.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.240
Yeah.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.440
Don't fucking Facebook them.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.040
Cause it's A, it's cheating.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.400
Your grandpa didn't have to do that.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.520
And that's, he fell in love.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.520
He fell in love in wartime.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.040
Well, I also think that you, I mean,

26:51.040 --> 26:54.560
it's sort of like, you lose a lot of the mystery,

26:54.560 --> 26:56.240
I think, or like a lot of the interesting,

26:56.880 --> 27:00.400
like there's a lot, I think you lose a lot of the mystique

27:00.400 --> 27:02.240
of someone if you can crawl back

27:02.240 --> 27:03.920
through their last six years of existence

27:03.920 --> 27:07.440
and see every, you know, every thing they've done

27:07.440 --> 27:08.880
and every party they've been to

27:08.880 --> 27:09.920
and every person they know.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.240
And it also cheapens those moments

27:12.240 --> 27:14.160
where you find out you like the same movie

27:14.160 --> 27:15.280
or listen to the same band.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.640
If you already know it going in

27:16.640 --> 27:18.960
and then she mentions it, you're like, yeah, yeah.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.040
Like it seems to take a little bit

27:21.040 --> 27:22.800
of the bam out of the firework.

27:22.800 --> 27:26.000
A little bit of the bam out of the firework.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.280
Which is not a saying.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.040
It's, no, it is now because you've-

27:29.040 --> 27:31.360
It is now, you just meant to listen.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.720
Bam out of the firework.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.440
Ginny up.

27:33.440 --> 27:36.480
This is our most trademarkable episode yet.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.400
We got a whole toy line coming out based on this one.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.040
Not Ginny up though.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.240
Hard to toy that one.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.200
Hard to toy it.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.000
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

27:48.880 --> 27:49.360
Please.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.360
Please.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.200
I'm curious to see if this Yahoo will take off.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.560
It was sent in by William Braun.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.120
Thanks, William.

27:55.120 --> 27:55.760
It's by Yahoo.

27:55.760 --> 27:56.640
That's his user.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.360
Ghost Dad starring Phil Cosby who asked-

28:02.160 --> 28:03.120
It's a very good name.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.960
Do people in the Pokemon universe eat Pokemon?

28:08.400 --> 28:10.400
Pokemon seem to be the only animals around the world

28:10.400 --> 28:12.240
created by the show and games.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.240
Do the humans who live there eat Pokemon?

28:14.240 --> 28:15.920
Considering that they can all be caught and trained,

28:15.920 --> 28:17.840
they obviously have some sort of intelligence.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.800
Would eating them be in violation of some sort of ethical code?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.240
The only way around this, I suppose,

28:22.240 --> 28:23.920
would be if everyone was vegetarian,

28:23.920 --> 28:26.240
but I don't see much evidence to support either side.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.200
What do you think?

28:27.200 --> 28:27.680
Definitely.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.440
Tricky quandary.

28:31.440 --> 28:32.400
Tricky conundrum.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.440
It's hard to catch them all if you keep fucking

28:35.440 --> 28:37.360
getting high on your own supply, so to speak.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.240
I feel like-

28:39.280 --> 28:42.000
Okay, so practically speaking,

28:42.000 --> 28:43.200
in the world of Pokemon,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
the battling and competition of Pokemon

28:46.000 --> 28:48.400
is a huge business.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.600
I mean, it's like the most important thing

28:49.600 --> 28:50.320
in their world, right?

28:50.880 --> 28:52.240
Yeah, I mean, it's on TV.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.840
It's on TV, Team Rocket, World Celebrities.

28:55.840 --> 28:58.880
The highest status you can hope to achieve

28:58.880 --> 29:02.080
is to be the master, you know what I mean?

29:02.080 --> 29:03.120
Like, the victor.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.200
I ask this because it seems like

29:09.520 --> 29:12.320
they would be too expensive to eat.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.760
Like, anytime you eat one, it's like eating a show pony.

29:15.760 --> 29:19.440
I guess, but the supply and demand is off there

29:19.440 --> 29:21.200
because you can just fucking walk in the grass

29:21.200 --> 29:22.400
and then there you go.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.120
Yeah, nobody's eating, like, Mew,

29:25.120 --> 29:27.360
but people are probably eating Pidgey left in there.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.600
You're saying there's a hierarchy of edible Pokemon,

29:33.600 --> 29:35.120
and you're saying near the bottom of that

29:35.120 --> 29:37.760
is a Pidgey, is a Magikarp, and then-

29:37.760 --> 29:38.800
Oh, what's the mouse one?

29:39.520 --> 29:40.560
Rattata.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.200
Rattata?

29:41.200 --> 29:41.920
But he's probably in there.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.080
Oh, I could go for a Rattata Frattata right now.

29:44.080 --> 29:44.880
It would be so good.

29:44.880 --> 29:45.520
Yum yum.

29:45.520 --> 29:45.920
Definitely.

29:45.920 --> 29:46.400
But you're saying-

29:46.400 --> 29:47.920
Everybody's probably eating Slowpoke.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.440
They're probably eating Snorlax

29:49.440 --> 29:50.880
because they're, like, herd animals.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.960
Sure. Snorlax is not.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.560
Snorlax is actually fairly rare,

29:54.560 --> 29:56.880
but I understand what you're saying.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.360
God, I ate my Snorlax.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.480
What if you just wander up to the campfire

30:04.480 --> 30:07.360
and you see someone guiltily eating a Snorlax

30:07.360 --> 30:10.480
and then you tell them, like, no, he was, like, really valuable.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.640
There's always, like, two of those in this whole game.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.880
I mean, but at the same time, though,

30:16.080 --> 30:17.280
you got to keep in mind

30:17.280 --> 30:19.840
there's only one Mewtwo you can catch, right?

30:20.480 --> 30:24.400
I bet he is fucking delectable

30:25.600 --> 30:27.600
because of the rarity of it.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.400
That's the thing.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.960
Only the super rich can afford to eat Mewtwo.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.240
Now that's a tricky one

30:32.240 --> 30:34.720
because he can speak English

30:34.720 --> 30:35.680
according to the first movie.

30:35.680 --> 30:36.960
Okay, that gets weird.

30:36.960 --> 30:37.360
Oh, no.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.560
He speaks the King's English,

30:38.560 --> 30:42.720
so, like, that would be uncomfortable

30:42.720 --> 30:44.480
unless you only ate just a little bit.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.240
Or you could do, like, one leg at a time.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.440
Yeah, precisely.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.920
And then you could still have the Pokémon.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.600
That would be an interesting twist

30:51.600 --> 30:54.560
because, like, I've reviewed pretty much every game

30:54.560 --> 30:56.720
that has ever come out for that series,

30:56.720 --> 30:58.240
and, you know, it's a little stale.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.160
It needs something to shake up the franchise.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.000
What if you get your starter Pokémon

31:02.000 --> 31:04.640
and you just eat it instantly right in front of them?

31:05.520 --> 31:06.160
Right in front of the professor.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.280
Which one do I want?

31:07.280 --> 31:08.960
Which one do I want?

31:08.960 --> 31:10.240
I'll take the grass type.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.360
Let me get a little ranch.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.720
Can I have another one?

31:14.720 --> 31:15.120
Nope.

31:15.120 --> 31:15.760
Ah, shit.

31:15.760 --> 31:16.320
Game over.

31:18.080 --> 31:18.640
End of the game.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.240
If your list of Pokémon gets full

31:20.240 --> 31:21.520
and you want to catch another one,

31:21.520 --> 31:22.720
you have to eat it.

31:22.720 --> 31:23.840
There's no storing it.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.280
You store it in your belly

31:25.280 --> 31:26.960
and you convert it to calorie energy.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.880
And it's not just, like, a pop-up,

31:28.880 --> 31:29.760
like, you've eaten it.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.600
Like, you have to actively do it.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.920
You have to press the button.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.680
And if you press the buttons wrong,

31:35.680 --> 31:38.080
it goes from, like, a smooth, easy mercy killing

31:38.080 --> 31:40.960
to, like, a botched, really horrible experiment.

31:40.960 --> 31:41.600
Exactly.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.080
I think there needs to be some recognition

31:45.120 --> 31:48.000
of the food chain of survival in the fittest.

31:48.000 --> 31:48.800
Because let's be honest,

31:48.800 --> 31:50.080
if you're out in the environment,

31:50.800 --> 31:53.280
you've got all your Pokémon are knocked out,

31:53.280 --> 31:54.080
except for one,

31:54.080 --> 31:55.840
and you fight like a fucking alligator,

31:56.400 --> 31:58.160
and he kills your last Pokémon,

31:58.160 --> 31:59.680
you're not just going to fall asleep

32:00.240 --> 32:01.680
and wake up in a Pokémon center.

32:01.680 --> 32:02.320
You'll be killed.

32:02.960 --> 32:03.920
You'll be devoured.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.080
Oh, let me throw out this twist.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.000
I hope you're listening, Pokémon game developers.

32:08.000 --> 32:08.500
They are.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.840
If you want to evolve your Pokémon,

32:11.840 --> 32:15.200
you have to make them eat another Pokémon of the same type.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.480
Oh, that's good.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.000
That's so good.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.200
You, uh, if you, if your Pokémon loses,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.920
you are force-fed the Pokémon.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.440
Like, you have to.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.880
By your opponent.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.520
By your opponent, the opponent gets a fork

32:31.520 --> 32:33.440
and just starts jamming it in.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.080
Starts jamming bites of that beaten Pokémon into your mouth.

32:38.560 --> 32:42.160
There is some guy right now at home jerking off.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.640
I never thought that anyone would tickle my pleasure center

32:48.640 --> 32:53.600
with Pokémon eating, uh, descriptions of it, like, finally.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.800
He's very confused as to why he's doing it.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.360
Like, I didn't know this was my thing until now.

32:59.360 --> 32:59.860
Oh, no.

33:01.520 --> 33:02.080
Oh, man.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.000
Man, so many good ideas.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.320
So many, so many ideas to capitalize on.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.920
Just break your walls.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.040
Like, try something new.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.200
What about a game where there is no evolution

33:12.080 --> 33:15.680
and it's all, um, intelligent design?

33:16.240 --> 33:16.800
You know what I mean?

33:17.600 --> 33:21.920
If you want your Charmander to evolve into Charmeleon,

33:21.920 --> 33:23.680
you don't have to just get him to level 16

33:23.680 --> 33:25.120
and then hope for the best.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.320
You can say a little prayer.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.800
Say, I wish, I wish my guy was a little bigger.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.720
And then based on, like, your devotion rating,

33:34.160 --> 33:35.520
maybe he'll come through for you.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.080
Maybe you won't.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.280
You have to sacrifice another Pokémon on an altar

33:39.280 --> 33:43.040
to make it to prove your devotion to benevolent Pokémon God?

33:43.040 --> 33:44.960
I don't think we have to go quite so Old Testament.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.760
I think that would be hard to hard to get past the ESRB, but...

33:47.760 --> 33:50.320
No, your Pokémon just has to believe in Jesus.

33:50.320 --> 33:50.820
Exactly.

33:51.920 --> 33:53.680
You have to, you have to immerse him,

33:53.680 --> 33:55.920
immerse them in the cleansing waters,

33:55.920 --> 33:57.760
which may be difficult if it's a fire type.

33:57.760 --> 34:01.040
The Jesus of this world, I feel like, would come down and just say,

34:01.040 --> 34:03.600
stop eating Pokémon.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.120
That was not the plan.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.720
You messed it up.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.560
They are actually supposed to be the dominant species, you guys.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.600
They're too fucked up.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.600
That's why some of them are dragons made of fire.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.480
They're just a wiping people out.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.880
I gave them all superpowers.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.160
Like, you've got nothing.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.080
Why are you eating them?

34:23.360 --> 34:25.360
That's the Pokémon game I want,

34:25.360 --> 34:28.080
when finally that fucking race war is ignited.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.680
It's just Pokémon versus people.

34:29.680 --> 34:33.520
The shortest race war in the history of mankind.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.680
I'll tell you what I've seen a lot of in the Pokémon games,

34:35.680 --> 34:39.360
and that is monsters capable of murdering each other

34:39.360 --> 34:41.600
with incredible psychic abilities.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.480
Something I've never seen in a Pokémon game is a gun.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.720
So I think it would last.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.880
I think we could handle some of the smaller ones,

34:50.880 --> 34:54.800
but boy howdy would we be in the tall grass,

34:54.800 --> 34:56.400
which is where you don't want to be,

34:56.400 --> 34:58.080
specifically in the Pokémon universe.

35:00.080 --> 35:00.960
Let's go to the money tub.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.920
I got a message from my brother Chumby and his fiance Laurel.

35:13.920 --> 35:14.880
You have another...

35:14.880 --> 35:15.680
We have another brother?

35:16.560 --> 35:17.360
No, this is a...

35:17.360 --> 35:17.920
I'm a character.

35:17.920 --> 35:18.800
I'm playing a character.

35:18.800 --> 35:19.520
Oh, okay.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.040
Okay, could you do a character voice?

35:21.840 --> 35:22.480
Okay.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.080
Hi, it's me Robin.

35:24.080 --> 35:24.560
Ellen.

35:24.560 --> 35:28.080
This message is from my brother Chumby and his fiance Laurel.

35:28.640 --> 35:31.200
Happy birthday and future vassary.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.760
I'm glad you could have May birthdays

35:33.760 --> 35:35.920
and are planning your upcoming wedding

35:35.920 --> 35:38.560
for the same month in 2014.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.880
It makes it really easy to claim one present

35:40.880 --> 35:42.560
for all three events.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.560
I could have given you a hundred dollars,

35:44.560 --> 35:46.880
but I spent it on this message instead.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.160
Suckers, love y'all.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.000
You are now going to talk like that

35:52.000 --> 35:53.920
for the remainder of the episode.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.520
It hurts my ears.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.480
It hurts our ears.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.080
Yep.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.880
I also like how it drifted in and out of an accent.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.400
It was not...

36:03.040 --> 36:03.760
That's her.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.880
She's traveled a lot.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.920
Robin is very continental.

36:08.960 --> 36:14.080
Here's another message from Johan Sterner and Kajsa Lunde.

36:14.880 --> 36:15.520
Oh man.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.600
Or Johan Sterner or...

36:19.600 --> 36:20.720
Johan, I think we gotta go with Johan.

36:20.720 --> 36:25.280
Johan Sterner and Kajsa Lunde or...

36:25.280 --> 36:26.240
Man, fuck it.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.960
It's for Frederick Olson.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.360
These are not Americans.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.960
These are non-American names.

36:32.960 --> 36:33.040
You don't know that?

36:33.040 --> 36:33.760
Melting pot.

36:33.760 --> 36:34.720
You don't know that?

36:34.720 --> 36:36.880
I hate to heat and out on you guys,

36:36.880 --> 36:40.800
but these are not good red-blooded Americans.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.440
Maybe they are.

36:41.440 --> 36:41.840
Okay.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.080
Happy birthday to our best friend, Frederick Olson.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.520
We know you like attention on your birthday,

36:45.520 --> 36:46.800
so we figured there's no better way

36:46.800 --> 36:49.440
than to get the brothers to say your name one more time.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.000
We hope to share at least 25 more years of weird discussions,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
too much vodka, and laughing way too loud

36:54.000 --> 36:55.280
in just the wrong places.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.880
Love, K-Dog, and Johan.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.400
P.S. W.H.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.040
What do you guys think?

36:59.040 --> 37:01.280
I think there's probably more sentence there.

37:01.280 --> 37:01.840
Oh, okay.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.680
P.S. What?

37:03.680 --> 37:05.760
P.S. How do you say our names?

37:11.120 --> 37:13.600
That's why we have character limits, people.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.080
Yeah.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.680
You gotta tighten up.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.080
So, happy birthday to Frederick,

37:18.080 --> 37:20.720
and happy birthday to Chumby,

37:20.720 --> 37:22.480
and future anniversary to Laurel.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.320
We hope you all have a very special day.

37:25.360 --> 37:28.080
You know how I guarantee that I have a very special day.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.280
Do you know how I guarantee that?

37:30.000 --> 37:30.800
How do you do it?

37:31.760 --> 37:32.560
I get it.

37:33.280 --> 37:34.240
Super wet.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.360
What is it in this content?

37:39.360 --> 37:39.920
My chins.

37:39.920 --> 37:44.000
I have big news for you guys on the Extreme Restraints front.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.320
ExtremeRestraints.com is, of course, your adult super store,

37:47.200 --> 37:49.440
where you can get everything under the sun

37:49.440 --> 37:51.040
that you're gonna put in your bum.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.840
And that's a new tagline I'm working on.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.360
They sent me a box.

37:55.360 --> 37:55.840
Oh, man.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.040
A sampler box.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.080
I saw the JPEG.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.400
Oh, man.

38:00.400 --> 38:03.360
There was a big penis.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.680
Just this big penis.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.200
It was a big penis.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.560
Big penis, just this big.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.240
And I don't mean a big penis.

38:12.240 --> 38:16.560
I mean, like, make you doubt yourself giant.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.200
Like, maybe somewhere out there,

38:19.200 --> 38:21.360
there's a person with this equipment.

38:21.360 --> 38:22.800
But it is a giant penis.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.480
There was also-

38:24.480 --> 38:25.040
Fake, right?

38:25.040 --> 38:28.640
It wasn't like some sort of kidnapping warning.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.760
It wasn't a threat.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.520
What's in the box?

38:31.520 --> 38:38.320
We kidnapped a tan elephant.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.000
You'd think that's what Brad Pitt was thinking,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.160
instead of like, well, at least it's not a giant dick.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.840
It's just gonna punch you in the head.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.640
Why did they send you a giant hog?

38:49.600 --> 38:50.800
That wasn't the only thing in there.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.400
There was some lube.

38:52.400 --> 38:52.880
Oh, good.

38:52.880 --> 38:58.000
There was three rings for dicks, which I-

38:58.000 --> 38:58.800
Oh, wait, there's three?

38:58.800 --> 39:00.080
So there's one for each of us?

39:00.080 --> 39:02.640
Like, yeah, I will not be divvying those up.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.240
Oh, come on.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.200
I want to be Hart.

39:12.480 --> 39:17.920
There was a little, what seemed to be a personal massager,

39:18.640 --> 39:22.800
and a ring with spikes on it

39:22.800 --> 39:25.680
that I'm not even trying to get into that biz.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.800
That's for self-defense.

39:26.800 --> 39:32.000
And then there was what looked like,

39:33.760 --> 39:36.960
basically like a plastic Q-tip with a D on the end of it

39:37.520 --> 39:40.400
that I think is supposed to go where the pee pee comes out.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.840
That's not happening either.

39:43.840 --> 39:48.080
Are the rings for your wiener?

39:48.080 --> 39:49.280
I can't say what they actually,

39:49.920 --> 39:51.600
that word makes me uncomfortable to say.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.520
For your cock!

39:53.520 --> 39:53.920
Thank you.

39:53.920 --> 40:02.800
Are they adjustable in case you need it really big or really small?

40:03.920 --> 40:05.120
One of those two.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.560
Either really big or really small,

40:06.560 --> 40:08.000
like if I bought one, would I have to?

40:08.800 --> 40:09.440
Is sizing-

40:09.440 --> 40:10.240
Are they sized?

40:11.920 --> 40:14.560
So they're fairly sturdy silicone,

40:14.560 --> 40:18.560
and you're supposed to get your balls and penis inside them.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.360
Oh, okay.

40:19.360 --> 40:25.200
I don't want to give myself away,

40:25.200 --> 40:27.760
but I either need it very big or very small.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.360
There were three different sizes,

40:31.360 --> 40:37.440
so I think that they could support the normal range of genital girth,

40:37.440 --> 40:39.440
I would say, whatever that is.

40:39.440 --> 40:39.680
Okay.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.720
Not normal, typical.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.160
Go visit extremerestraints.com, go view their wares.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.080
If you use the coupon code SWORDFISH,

40:48.080 --> 40:53.440
I think is where we left it, then you can save 20% on your order,

40:54.720 --> 40:56.560
which is a shit ton of money.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.680
I figured out, I found out,

40:58.480 --> 41:01.680
James Medina from Extreme Restraints explained to me how it gets hacked.

41:01.680 --> 41:01.920
How?

41:02.880 --> 41:05.760
It's not from people using it or tweeting about it,

41:05.760 --> 41:11.600
it's from people Google searching because they can't remember Extreme Restraints coupon code,

41:12.880 --> 41:14.400
and that's how it comes up.

41:14.400 --> 41:19.600
So people, write down SWORDFISH on a Post-it, stick it to your monitor.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.440
Don't Google search it, you fools.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.000
Well, you told them the new password, right, Joe?

41:24.560 --> 41:24.960
What?

41:24.960 --> 41:25.600
I thought you did.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.560
Did someone tell them that the password is SWORDFISH?

41:28.560 --> 41:32.000
No, because if you fucking tell them, if you fucking tell them, it'll get leaked.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.800
No, I didn't tell you about Extreme Restraints so they could put it in their computer.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.640
One of us should probably do that.

41:36.640 --> 41:37.600
Travis, why don't you handle that?

41:37.600 --> 41:39.360
You've been our main point of contact.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.640
Okay, I will email them after this.

41:40.640 --> 41:41.600
But don't email them.

41:42.240 --> 41:42.720
Oh, God.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.120
I'll wire them.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.720
The internet spiders are all over.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.760
They'll crawl anything.

41:47.760 --> 42:17.520
So go visit, go shop, go get it wet.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.600
The popular website on the internet.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.440
Dave Hill's podcasting incident.

42:21.440 --> 42:25.120
It's pretty much just like me making out with your ears or something.

42:25.920 --> 42:26.800
Okay, thanks.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.120
Bye.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.760
I often find myself flying alone on trips.

42:29.760 --> 42:32.960
The problem comes when using the restroom at the airport.

42:32.960 --> 42:38.560
As a solo, as a solo flyer, it's Mother's Day, shut up.

42:38.560 --> 42:42.480
My only option is to take my carry-on bags with me into the bathroom.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.120
But then what?

42:43.120 --> 42:47.360
I hate putting my bags on the bathroom floor, but I don't see any other choice.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.640
Help me out, brothers.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.520
What can I do?

42:51.520 --> 42:55.920
Well, I mean, real talk, aren't there usually like hooks on the back of bathroom stall doors?

42:55.920 --> 43:02.480
This is a real issue because finding a trusted confidant is the best option.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.360
But even then, how can you really trust anybody in this crazy world of ours?

43:06.160 --> 43:10.400
The problem is in this day and age, even if you do that, like, hey, we've just been

43:10.400 --> 43:13.200
having a nice conversation for the last 10 minutes.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.400
Could you watch my bag?

43:14.400 --> 43:17.440
Like instantly in an airport, everybody's butthole seizes up.

43:17.440 --> 43:20.400
You're like, oh, God, just like in the homeland.

43:20.400 --> 43:26.160
I'm saying that because that's the kind of thing that security guards at airports are

43:26.160 --> 43:28.560
on point for, people walking away from their bags.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.720
Yeah, yeah, they're waiting for it.

43:30.720 --> 43:34.240
But at the same time, when you wheel that shit in the bathroom, and then there's an

43:34.240 --> 43:38.640
expensive business, an expensive businessman, there's an expensive businessman who sees

43:38.640 --> 43:39.120
you do that.

43:39.120 --> 43:43.280
And he's like, oh, you're bringing your luggage in the bathroom, huh?

43:43.280 --> 43:45.760
You're going to make poop bags because that's what it is now.

43:45.760 --> 43:48.480
That's that luggage that you got for graduation that was new.

43:48.480 --> 43:49.360
Now it's poop bags.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.120
Those are your bags.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.800
Never fly by yourself.

43:52.800 --> 43:56.160
Nobody else can touch that handle now because there was at least a 10 second period where

43:56.160 --> 43:57.120
you touch it with poop hands.

43:58.480 --> 44:03.280
There was in the Charlotte airport, if you've spent as much time there as Griffin and I

44:03.280 --> 44:09.040
have over the years, you will know that there are attendants in the bathrooms.

44:09.840 --> 44:19.200
They are, by and large, the worst because it is creating this false social system where

44:19.200 --> 44:26.320
I have had any problem with any part of this exchange over the past three decades.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.880
I know my whole routine when I go in.

44:28.880 --> 44:36.640
I do not need someone handing me a paper towel or more likely judging me for not washing

44:36.640 --> 44:37.040
my hands.

44:37.040 --> 44:39.760
But they babysit your bags for you, right?

44:40.720 --> 44:41.840
That's what I'm thinking.

44:41.840 --> 44:45.840
Maybe that is the actual use of an attendant.

44:45.840 --> 44:48.240
You say like, hey, can you keep an eye on this?

44:49.200 --> 44:51.280
I'm taking the dude to poopytown.

44:51.280 --> 44:51.440
Right.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.240
And he says like, no problem.

44:54.240 --> 44:54.720
I got this for you.

44:54.720 --> 44:57.200
He would say no problemo because he's cool.

44:57.200 --> 44:58.800
What?

44:58.800 --> 45:00.000
He's cool.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.480
Not because I wasn't saying that to be racist.

45:02.480 --> 45:05.520
I'm saying it because he was like, no problemo, chief.

45:05.520 --> 45:06.160
You know what I mean?

45:07.200 --> 45:09.520
And then you have to give him some money when you get out.

45:09.520 --> 45:11.280
That's the exchange you're making here.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.320
What about lockers?

45:13.600 --> 45:15.600
What about bathroom lockers?

45:15.600 --> 45:17.360
You can put your effects in there.

45:17.360 --> 45:18.720
Oh, those keys though.

45:18.720 --> 45:19.360
Never mind.

45:19.360 --> 45:26.000
It's sort of like the shoe cradles at McDonald's play place.

45:26.000 --> 45:26.560
That's exact.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.240
I'm talking about a cubbyhole.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.480
I would want there to be some security though.

45:30.480 --> 45:34.880
But there's no way to sterilize that security, if that makes sense.

45:34.880 --> 45:38.480
A keypad even with a new pin that you have to recognize.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.240
Oh, those numbers would be so grubby.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.960
Oh, they would be grubby to the maximum degree.

45:43.840 --> 45:44.320
OK.

45:44.320 --> 45:47.120
Something just occurred to me as a matter of fact.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.560
Something just occurred to me as I've been thinking about this problem.

45:50.560 --> 45:51.040
What's that?

45:52.320 --> 45:56.080
Unless I've missed something along the lines, when you enter an airport,

45:56.720 --> 45:59.440
you go through very extensive security checks.

45:59.440 --> 45:59.680
Yes.

46:01.040 --> 46:05.120
So then why, once you're past that point, can't you leave your bag sitting around?

46:05.920 --> 46:06.560
You should fucking-

46:06.560 --> 46:08.720
What are they afraid has happened?

46:08.720 --> 46:10.480
I actually have this thought too, Travis.

46:10.480 --> 46:20.720
It's like, there is not a cross section of people who A, have paid $400 to be in a building,

46:21.360 --> 46:25.360
and also are going to take a shot at stealing someone's suitcase.

46:25.360 --> 46:28.800
Like that's not, that Venn diagram doesn't really line up.

46:28.800 --> 46:29.760
I know what you're saying.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.800
I've thought that often at an airport.

46:32.800 --> 46:38.640
Like, well, I feel a little bit safer here because that's a pretty long grift.

46:38.640 --> 46:42.640
If you're buying a plane ticket so you can get into a place and steal bags.

46:43.920 --> 46:47.040
Well, I also think it's like the security thing, but it just seems to me like,

46:47.600 --> 46:51.920
hey, once you pass that point, hey, you're, you're, it's like, uh,

46:52.560 --> 46:53.840
it's like international waters.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.320
You know what I mean?

46:54.320 --> 46:55.040
You're cool.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.320
Like everybody's okay here.

46:57.360 --> 46:58.160
I don't know.

46:58.160 --> 46:58.640
I don't know.

46:58.640 --> 47:05.680
Maybe, maybe I'm just a little bit, I see the world as a little bit sunnier place where I trust people.

47:05.680 --> 47:06.000
Yeah.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.240
How about it?

47:08.240 --> 47:09.040
How about it?

47:09.040 --> 47:10.400
The world, huh?

47:11.520 --> 47:15.360
Just think about it because I'd rather trust people than get poop on my bag.

47:15.360 --> 47:15.600
Sure.

47:16.480 --> 47:16.960
The end.

47:16.960 --> 47:20.560
I guess the bigger question is why, when you go through security,

47:21.120 --> 47:23.600
why do they have to touch so many kid balls?

47:23.600 --> 47:24.400
Fucking weirdos.

47:28.800 --> 47:30.960
I'm just saying you got bomb sized balls, kid.

47:30.960 --> 47:31.520
Let's see them.

47:34.240 --> 47:35.200
That's a compliment.

47:35.200 --> 47:35.920
That's a compliment.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.360
You have bomb sized balls.

47:37.360 --> 47:38.480
Your balls are the bomb.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.680
Teddy, I got a new one.

47:39.680 --> 47:40.960
Your balls are the bomb.

47:40.960 --> 47:41.520
Write it down.

47:42.320 --> 47:43.200
I'm going to use that a lot.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.200
I'm going to use that a lot over the next few months.

47:45.200 --> 47:52.560
When I touch approximately 1,800 kid balls in 900 scrotums.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.360
It's going to be great.

47:53.360 --> 47:55.200
Remind me, remind me to say it.

47:55.200 --> 47:55.840
If I forget.

47:56.480 --> 47:57.440
God, they're the worst.

47:58.480 --> 47:59.280
You guys want to Yahoo?

47:59.920 --> 48:00.320
Yeah.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.440
They're American heroes.

48:01.440 --> 48:02.400
They are American heroes.

48:02.400 --> 48:07.760
Thanks for the security, but also the insecurity in some places.

48:07.760 --> 48:11.680
Can we stop, by the way, TSA, if you're listening, and I'm sure you are.

48:12.240 --> 48:14.080
Can we stop with the shoes now?

48:14.080 --> 48:17.040
I think we're reaching a point where we can.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.440
Grandparents and kids don't have to.

48:19.440 --> 48:19.760
Right.

48:19.760 --> 48:22.400
Which is like a crazy thing to say.

48:26.080 --> 48:28.400
There's no way you'd put them in your kid's shoes.

48:29.360 --> 48:30.720
Who would ever think of that?

48:30.720 --> 48:34.720
Oh, maybe a terrorist who knows you don't check those kids' shoes anymore.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.880
Like, I think they could work out getting a kid.

48:36.880 --> 48:40.480
Do you guys think that by answering this question, we are now on a watch list?

48:40.480 --> 48:40.960
Definitely.

48:41.520 --> 48:41.920
Okay.

48:41.920 --> 48:42.800
Absolutely.

48:42.800 --> 48:45.120
We're on a lot of watch lists for this episode.

48:45.120 --> 48:47.840
We're on Patricia Heaton's watch list, so it's for god damn sure.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.760
And that is a list you do not want to be on.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.240
She will say some shit about you at the Golden Globes.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.000
Hachi machi.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.360
Hachi machi, indeed.

48:55.360 --> 48:58.080
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Cal Skullthroop.

48:58.080 --> 48:58.720
Thanks, Cal.

48:58.720 --> 49:04.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Soccerman who asks, can my-

49:04.960 --> 49:06.240
I think it's pronounced Soccerman.

49:06.240 --> 49:12.080
Soccerman, JP Soccerman asks, can my parents sue me for breaking the window?

49:13.040 --> 49:16.400
I was playing cracker with my younger brother and I hit it and it shattered the window.

49:16.400 --> 49:16.960
I'm 15.

49:17.760 --> 49:19.200
Wait, was playing what now?

49:19.200 --> 49:19.840
Cracker.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.200
What is cracker?

49:21.200 --> 49:21.680
What's that?

49:22.720 --> 49:24.480
Have you ever heard of skank and skanky biscuit?

49:24.480 --> 49:28.400
Oh, I don't think it's the same thing.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.400
I hope it's not the same thing.

49:32.400 --> 49:32.880
In the UK-

49:32.880 --> 49:35.280
Why skanky biscuit broke the window?

49:35.280 --> 49:38.240
In the UK, it's called nasty cracker.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.000
Oh, no.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.920
In the Mediterranean region, it's uh oh, pita.

49:49.280 --> 49:51.600
And I like nodding non.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.040
Oh, I was god damn it.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.680
You beat me to it, I was gonna say no, no, no, damn it.

49:57.680 --> 50:03.360
I don't know what cracker is, but the question is, can we bring lawyers into this?

50:04.400 --> 50:05.840
Can you sue a kid?

50:05.840 --> 50:07.840
Do you remember the documentary North?

50:07.840 --> 50:08.080
Yeah.

50:08.880 --> 50:13.360
I feel like that's got a lot of legal precedent for this kind of thing.

50:13.360 --> 50:13.760
Sure, yeah.

50:14.880 --> 50:19.680
Scalia frequently, frequently brings that up as a super precedent.

50:19.680 --> 50:24.800
I know that kids can't go to jail, which is crazy.

50:26.080 --> 50:28.880
Just because they're younger, but they can still be little criminals.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.320
They can still be little murderers.

50:30.960 --> 50:35.120
Meanwhile, Jodi Arias, poor sweet little Jodi Arias, just because she's over 18.

50:35.120 --> 50:36.080
That's not right.

50:36.080 --> 50:37.040
Not my America.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.600
What do you think should happen to Jodi Arias who killed her boyfriend?

50:42.240 --> 50:44.800
She's just as sweet and innocent and frumpy.

50:46.080 --> 50:46.880
She's frumpy now.

50:46.880 --> 50:47.920
She didn't used to be frumpy.

50:47.920 --> 50:48.880
She frumped herself up.

50:48.880 --> 50:49.840
Isn't that enough?

50:49.840 --> 50:51.200
Isn't that punishment enough?

50:53.200 --> 50:54.480
She's been fully frumped out.

50:54.480 --> 50:56.320
She's been frumped to the max.

50:56.880 --> 50:58.160
She has to wear glasses.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.720
She has to wear glasses and her hair is brown now.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.880
You have sucked the life out of her, CNN.

51:07.840 --> 51:09.840
Why can't we sue some kids is the question.

51:09.840 --> 51:10.720
Because I have some kids.

51:10.720 --> 51:12.320
Oh man, I have some kids I'd sue.

51:14.000 --> 51:14.640
Who would you sue?

51:14.640 --> 51:19.360
Who would be the first kid you'd sue?

51:19.360 --> 51:22.160
I saw Iron Man 3 last week and I had to sit next to a kid.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.840
That kid for sure, definitely.

51:25.840 --> 51:26.160
Okay.

51:26.160 --> 51:29.920
Let's just say the Alamo Drafthouse did not crack down on their no talking law on this

51:30.880 --> 51:36.960
use, which I guess they have an exemption for under 18s, which again is super fucked up.

51:36.960 --> 51:39.200
I paid my money and I want to see all the movies.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.400
I want to see all the movies.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.440
Can't you summon someone over?

51:43.440 --> 51:46.320
Can't you beckon and say this kid's a pit?

51:46.320 --> 51:46.800
I can.

51:46.800 --> 51:47.600
I can do that.

51:47.600 --> 51:50.320
If I want to fucking ruin this kid's life.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.720
This is all that he wants is to see Iron Man 3.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.000
There was a lot of bouncing.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.840
Is there a statute of limitations on this?

51:57.840 --> 52:02.960
Because there's a kid when I saw Harry Potter 7 Part 2 that was dressed as Harry Potter

52:02.960 --> 52:07.600
and loudly announced how it was different in the book every time something happened.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.840
But that was like, you know, two or three, four years ago.

52:09.840 --> 52:10.400
Oh yeah.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.240
Is it too late to sue that kid?

52:12.240 --> 52:13.280
You missed your window.

52:13.280 --> 52:17.440
I think the window for kids suing is like a month, two, maybe tops.

52:18.400 --> 52:23.440
I would actually really appreciate that service if I was in a movie theater watching Harry

52:23.440 --> 52:24.800
Potter 7 too.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.360
Are you Timmy?

52:26.800 --> 52:27.840
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

52:27.840 --> 52:28.240
Thanks kid.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.200
Are you Timmy Jenkins?

52:29.760 --> 52:31.040
We have some popcorn for you.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.080
Yeah, I'm Timmy Jenkins.

52:32.080 --> 52:32.480
Just kidding.

52:32.480 --> 52:33.280
You just got served.

52:37.040 --> 52:37.920
Nice try, Bucko.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.160
Are you Timmy Jenkins?

52:40.160 --> 52:41.760
No, I'm Jimmy Rankins.

52:41.760 --> 52:42.720
Ah, fuck.

52:42.720 --> 52:43.120
Got us.

52:44.080 --> 52:44.560
Next time.

52:44.560 --> 52:49.200
Finally a good reason for kids not to talk to strangers when we try to serve you.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.960
We got a present here for you.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.600
I'm not sure about it this time.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.480
I'm gonna need you to give it to my associate, please.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.000
Hey, good news.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.760
You're gonna go on the super toy run.

53:01.760 --> 53:04.000
Holy shit, I never thought it would happen to me.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.040
Just get in this van.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.240
You're in a court.

53:06.240 --> 53:06.480
Right.

53:07.120 --> 53:08.800
There's a court inside the van?

53:08.800 --> 53:09.440
Van court.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.920
A court inside the super toy run.

53:11.920 --> 53:16.560
You take one turn, turn left at the creepy crawlers and oops, you're in court.

53:18.000 --> 53:18.560
Kid court.

53:19.120 --> 53:22.480
This has been our advice show, My Brother, My Brother and Me.

53:22.480 --> 53:28.000
We sure hope you've enjoyed listening to it nearly as much as we've enjoyed recording it.

53:28.000 --> 53:34.000
It's a genuine pleasure and an honor to do this show for you every week.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.040
And we love you so much and thank you for continuing to listen.

53:37.040 --> 53:40.800
And we have a new My Brother, My Brother and Me sampler.

53:40.800 --> 53:48.880
It's at bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM2013 so you can go check that out.

53:48.880 --> 53:52.640
And it's a great way to get people into the show so you can share it with them.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.360
It is a little heavy on dick stuff.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.440
I don't think it's more dick.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.360
I feel like it is representative to the...

54:00.560 --> 54:04.000
See, this was before I switched to more neutral terms like Jenny up.

54:04.000 --> 54:09.040
So I feel like now, yes, it is dick heavy for us.

54:09.040 --> 54:14.000
Now we are more equal opportunity genital discussers.

54:15.520 --> 54:16.320
Discussioners.

54:16.960 --> 54:17.760
Mentalisters.

54:18.880 --> 54:21.040
We got a live show coming up in Max Fun Con.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.760
So that'll be up later this month.

54:24.560 --> 54:25.680
Psyched about Max Fun Con.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.400
You guys pumped?

54:27.120 --> 54:27.920
Oh, so pumped.

54:27.920 --> 54:28.560
You guys...

54:28.560 --> 54:32.240
Hey, which reminds me, if you're gonna be at Max Fun Con, if you're gonna be at our live show,

54:32.240 --> 54:39.600
start sending in your questions now and make sure to put in the subject line Max Fun Con question.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.360
So you can be sure to hit your question at the live show.

54:41.360 --> 54:45.280
We should clarify that this is not an open to the public live show.

54:45.280 --> 54:47.520
This is a live show we're doing at Max Fun Con.

54:47.520 --> 54:51.440
But you'll be able to hear the show, probably our first episode of June when that goes up.

54:51.440 --> 54:53.760
It'll be a Max Fun Con special.

54:53.760 --> 54:56.160
We are talking about doing more live shows though.

54:56.160 --> 55:02.960
We are making, we are having more earnest discussions than we've had all year, I would say.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.720
The gears, they are a turning.

55:04.720 --> 55:10.080
Speaking of live shows, our buddies at Throwing Shade are working on a tour right now.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.080
They have lots of dates kind of moving throughout the country.

55:12.080 --> 55:17.120
So go to, you can go to ThrowingShade.com to check out upcoming shows or it's on Max Fun.

One more thing, Tristan the Marine is shipping out soon.

55:39.920 --> 55:44.160
And so to send them off right, there's a kind of East Coast,

55:44.160 --> 55:46.800
my brother, my brother and me meetup being put together in DC.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.400
It's coming up, it's on May 25th.

55:50.400 --> 55:55.920
If you want all the information, just go to packyourbagsdc.eventbrite.com.

55:55.920 --> 55:59.200
That's eventbrite, B-R-I-T-E.com.

55:59.200 --> 55:59.600
Go check it out.

55:59.600 --> 56:01.920
I don't think people know how Eventbrite...

56:02.720 --> 56:03.120
I don't know.

56:03.120 --> 56:04.480
I've never heard of Eventbrite.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.080
Well, that's because you don't get invited to shit.

56:06.960 --> 56:07.920
God knows that's true.

56:09.280 --> 56:12.080
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

56:12.080 --> 56:14.080
into Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:14.080 --> 56:19.200
It was as much as I appreciated the new theme song that we used on 150,

56:19.760 --> 56:23.280
