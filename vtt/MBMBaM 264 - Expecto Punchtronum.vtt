00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modren

00:47.840 --> 00:53.360
era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.680
And I'm your sweet swaddled baby Griffin McElroy. Hi!

00:57.680 --> 01:05.520
Hi guys it's the most wonderful time of the year. Lay's Do Us a Flavor Taste of America is back

01:05.520 --> 01:13.520
with four or some other number. It is four! It is some other number new flavors. Each of us has

01:13.520 --> 01:20.320
gotten one of these brand new flavors to uh to sample and try and I thought we could just start

01:20.320 --> 01:26.160
off the show with a taste test to find out get this battle royale going. Now let me see let me

01:26.160 --> 01:33.440
grab my bag uh that I have uh I got here. Now I have the that's oh that sounds like a thick

01:35.040 --> 01:40.960
and solid timing cracker barrel bag. Yeah and they hit they really sprung for quality packaging. Now

01:40.960 --> 01:51.920
right here I have um meatloaf Aunt Judy's okay meatloaf Aunt Judy's meatloaf uh-huh flavored

01:51.920 --> 02:02.240
spaghetti sauce on rigatoni chips. Okay but all right so I'm so down with so many of the layers

02:02.240 --> 02:07.760
the complex flavor layers that Lay's is bringing to the table or should I say that Lay's has

02:07.760 --> 02:16.240
accepted into their retinue of flavors um except the the spaghetti sauce on rigatoni just seems

02:16.240 --> 02:21.200
like they should just call that spaghetti right because I don't think unless there's a texture

02:21.200 --> 02:27.840
and I don't want to pull out my foodie card on you but there is a definite flavor in spaghetti

02:27.840 --> 02:36.640
it's a very earthy uh like rustic flavor and in rigatoni it's much more of like a city like uh

02:36.640 --> 02:43.680
like uptown elitist flavor. Okay now I'm uh taking them to the uh bud shack which is what I call my

02:43.680 --> 02:51.920
mouth. All right here we go. It tastes exactly like meatloaf Aunt Judy's meatloaf flavored

02:51.920 --> 02:59.040
spaghetti on rigatoni but in a ship. It's amazing. I've got pineapple and cottage cheese that was

02:59.040 --> 03:03.120
left out on the counter overnight but you put it back in the fridge but now you're unsure whether

03:03.120 --> 03:15.840
or not you want to eat it chips chips it my god is that the accuracy is what I'm first struck by

03:15.840 --> 03:21.280
you can you can taste you can taste the time you can taste the time you can also taste like the

03:21.280 --> 03:25.920
indecision as to whether or not it's safe to eat like I don't know I don't know if that comes from

03:25.920 --> 03:32.320
like beaver anal glands or what that is or how they get that flavor that's amazing but in the

03:32.320 --> 03:37.520
best thing those pineapple is it pineapple did you say yeah those chips gonna make you

03:39.040 --> 03:46.080
your spunk taste good my spunks that's just a whole factoid from that I picked up from

03:46.720 --> 03:53.680
GQ magazine now Griffin what did you what flavor did you guys I have this bag I'm reading I you

03:53.680 --> 03:59.440
sent me this I didn't buy this at the store because I'd be too embarrassed it seems weirdly

03:59.440 --> 04:06.160
conceptual because the the the bag has the words printed on it grandpa's war stories

04:08.160 --> 04:13.600
chips chips well no it doesn't say it doesn't say chips if you look all over a bag of Lays it

04:13.600 --> 04:17.200
doesn't say chips anywhere on there you know what you're getting into it's got the Lays brand on it

04:17.200 --> 04:22.800
you know these grandpa war stories are going to be delivered in chip form so let me just

04:22.800 --> 04:29.520
print like like really utilitarian like no images like right ration like they've been rationed like a

04:29.520 --> 04:37.120
chip ration do you mean do you mean ration you psychopath I did when I started and then I said

04:37.120 --> 04:41.280
ration and then I thought I should lean into it like it's a joke I'm doing all right uh let me

04:41.280 --> 04:54.240
crack these open the meaty bag Griffin in case it's some sort of crystal

04:58.400 --> 05:02.720
kill the gelatinous cube that was protecting hey I'm sorry I didn't have chips on hand like

05:02.720 --> 05:08.720
my two brothers who apparently just have chips on their desk ready at the at the anyway oh I'm

05:08.720 --> 05:20.160
definitely eating chips right now and uh kind of a musty kind of a musty scent and that they do

05:20.160 --> 05:26.800
they taste they're they seem like they carry a lot of caloric value which is good for like powering

05:26.800 --> 05:31.680
your very dense yeah it gives you it's gonna give you a lot of like bayonet stab energy

05:31.680 --> 05:40.320
out on the field um and um just let me get another bite it tastes like grandpa's been

05:40.320 --> 05:46.000
lying to us this whole time oh shit it's it's weird that that revelation had to come

05:46.560 --> 05:52.000
from the lays factory but I think he may I mean I think he may have conflated some of his shit

05:52.880 --> 05:57.520
with like some some Spielbergian nonsense like I think our grandpa this whole time you know all

05:57.520 --> 06:02.960
those stories he told us about how um he would carry wounded troops from the front line to the

06:02.960 --> 06:07.360
battlefield back to the back lines about where they can get help and then back once they were

06:07.360 --> 06:14.320
healthy again and then um also he was a horse I think he just went and saw war horse and just

06:14.320 --> 06:18.880
kind of lifted it wholesale it does explain why he didn't start telling those stories until like a

06:18.880 --> 06:22.880
decade ago right when war horse came out anyway that's what these chips have told me I'm gonna

06:22.880 --> 06:27.520
open the fourth bag here these are we're gonna keep going huh well this is the last flavor okay

06:28.880 --> 06:39.120
truffle fries well that sounds like a real oh god that's disgusting ladies you should be ashamed

06:39.120 --> 06:47.520
of yourself ladies and gentlemen this has been our first ever skit I really hope you like and

06:47.520 --> 06:55.200
seen and let this skit let this skit stand as a testament lays we will never accept your money

06:55.200 --> 06:59.440
we will never ever ever do a sponsored episode for you ladies no matter how much you want to pay us

07:00.000 --> 07:05.120
yeah there's no number no we're drawing a line in the sand lays you I will give an independent

07:05.120 --> 07:10.880
sponsorship no lays and Justin don't have to know about you can't buy yeah Travis will just

07:10.880 --> 07:16.080
start saying a lot of really positive stuff about lays chips and to and Justin it might raise our

07:16.080 --> 07:20.960
suspicions I want to take this is an advice for the modern era I'm just a macro uh I want to take

07:20.960 --> 07:24.240
our list we already said our names I want to take a listeners inside a bit because like a lot of

07:24.240 --> 07:28.960
people are like where do they come up with this stuff uh this great stuff and today it was um

07:29.760 --> 07:37.280
uh we had uh my daughter's birthday party for her first birthday she is not at a chip eating age

07:37.280 --> 07:41.920
no they weren't just for her there were other people in attendance and I uh we had some rich

07:41.920 --> 07:48.320
chips and I wanted an in-fiction reason to eat some during the show oh I thought as it goes here

07:48.320 --> 07:54.400
it's like I've actually just finished today taste testing all four flavors from the new lays line

07:54.400 --> 07:59.920
so uh basically the gravy is the best all right followed by the gyro and then the ruben sandwich

07:59.920 --> 08:03.920
and truffle fries are the worst I didn't get much out of the truffle fries we we served this

08:05.280 --> 08:11.120
why it just sounds like you guys ate a lot of chips today that's a lot of chips let's ask

08:11.120 --> 08:15.520
some questions and then by which I mean answer the ones that got asked to us by us for us from us

08:16.640 --> 08:22.240
with us brothers I have a bachelor's degree in psychology my friends and I often have

08:22.240 --> 08:26.880
conversations where psychological ideas are pertinent but because there are so many movies

08:26.880 --> 08:31.920
and tv shows that deal with forensic psychology I never know which facts and concepts are common

08:31.920 --> 08:37.840
knowledge and which aren't if you want to drop a sweet psych fact in a relevant context of course

08:37.840 --> 08:44.560
should I say something to indicate it might be common knowledge like of course or you probably

08:44.560 --> 08:50.800
already know or should I just say the thing and treat it as a revelation every time both sound

08:50.800 --> 08:55.440
really annoying and arrogant to me yeah but which one is better and that's from possibly pretentious

08:55.440 --> 09:01.920
by the pacific and my friend there's a third option you have not yet considered let me let me

09:01.920 --> 09:06.640
it's one word let me just highlight it for you don't I think that was I think it was two words

09:06.640 --> 09:12.640
actually the way you just said it don't hold on hold on don't do it as someone who likes to be

09:12.640 --> 09:17.600
pretentious and spout facts that they know what if you're helping like answer a question what if

09:17.600 --> 09:23.280
people are going hey why why do have you is there a thing where why do people and you're like well

09:23.280 --> 09:29.600
it's this that's that can be useful and helpful right yeah it's not that it's a it's the thing

09:29.600 --> 09:36.960
that like if you okay if you have to couch anything this much like if you have to like

09:36.960 --> 09:44.320
contextualize what you're going to say this much I don't think it's like the perfect bone more to

09:44.320 --> 09:52.880
like drip into the conversation I'm not I'm not positive about it uh I I do Sydney has this problem

09:52.880 --> 09:58.240
where she has a lot of medical knowledge and like she has the real burden she's a lot well

09:58.240 --> 10:04.800
this specific issue that we're discussing she has lost her barometer for like what people know about

10:04.800 --> 10:10.160
like pills and bones and blood and stuff so she'll like say I mean she'll say like well and of course

10:10.160 --> 10:16.640
those uh they're you can't even fake some shit that's how off the game you are no no it's like

10:16.640 --> 10:21.360
she'll say like and then he was walking he had a broken um they're these two long things

10:21.360 --> 10:28.640
that come down from your crotch and feet at the end you mean legs yeah is that a common yeah like

10:28.640 --> 10:34.640
I everybody knows legs Sydney that's one it must be especially hard though to be like to actually

10:34.640 --> 10:42.320
have like a degree in something and be surrounded by people that watched CSI and like SVU and shit

10:42.320 --> 10:46.720
and they're like well you know the reason people behave that way and you're just sitting there like

10:46.720 --> 10:52.400
sitting there like biting your tongue like that's wrong like that's not true they have steered you

10:52.400 --> 10:57.040
wrong sir but like you don't want to correct everybody and be the guy let like you can't have

10:57.040 --> 11:02.080
a conversation about a movie with because like they want to correct all the facts in it that's

11:02.080 --> 11:09.280
why people stop talking to me about Looper oh my god Travis and Looper I got real issues with Looper

11:09.280 --> 11:16.240
you guys what what expertise are you bringing to the Looper table I've done a lot of independent

11:16.240 --> 11:22.320
study on time travel Justin a lot I've read books about it I've I've watched just about every time

11:22.320 --> 11:27.840
travel movie that exists and I see the lake house hey hey hey hey hey no I've never seen lake house

11:27.840 --> 11:34.400
griffin you've got me there a bozinga one point for griffin we're keeping score for the rest of

11:34.400 --> 11:38.880
this podcast oh okay it's just a fun you know been looking for fun bits I thought it'd be fun if we

11:38.880 --> 11:44.800
could like keep score gamify let me let me offer this suggestion and then you guys tell me that

11:44.800 --> 11:53.120
I'm wrong um what if you just say it as if like you're saying a thing that everybody knows that

11:53.120 --> 11:57.280
if you're just like well you know that blah blah blah blah blah and then if you were like really

11:57.280 --> 12:02.960
you're like oh yeah and then like then you get to like see I think the you know thing bothers me

12:02.960 --> 12:09.440
because it does assume like this is just something that everybody knows like it could come off as that

12:09.440 --> 12:14.640
like I I just don't think you pre-sell it I think you just drop it because if you're talking to

12:14.640 --> 12:18.960
people you know like they'll know where you're coming from with it like they'll know your

12:18.960 --> 12:25.440
expertise I said just don't like preamble just get in there with your facts but you gotta you

12:25.440 --> 12:30.800
got you guys aren't considering this third heat that I'm now going to bring to the discussion

12:30.800 --> 12:35.920
which is this is great and all and you're considering these two possibilities you're

12:35.920 --> 12:40.560
gonna say something smart that they didn't know and making them feel small when you preface it

12:40.560 --> 12:45.680
with this or you're gonna say something and they of course know exactly what you're talking about

12:45.680 --> 12:52.160
and you must think we're so stupid third heat what if you're wrong about anything and they know

12:52.160 --> 12:57.440
the truth what if you're ever like hey have you ever heard of this guy sigmund freud and they're

12:57.440 --> 13:03.200

13:57.120 --> 14:03.200
it's by yahoo answers user heart heart heart it's just three heart emoticons they ask

14:03.200 --> 14:05.840
my dad smells his fingers why

14:09.360 --> 14:15.120
so wherever we are either in the car the store anywhere he smells his fingers and it gets on

14:15.120 --> 14:22.560
my nerves so much whatever he does he usually smells it for example he puts his fingers through

14:22.560 --> 14:29.600
his mustache and smells it he rubs his hands on his face and he smells it he even takes his socks

14:29.600 --> 14:34.720
off and picks his toenails and smells it he puts his hands in his armpit and smells it he'll rub

14:34.720 --> 14:40.080
his hand around his neck and smells it he'll put his fingernail between his teeth and he smells it

14:40.080 --> 14:45.920
he runs his fingers on his lips and smells it you name it he probably smells it it bothers the heck

14:45.920 --> 14:51.200
out of me and it's embarrassing when we're in public spaces uh so what i want to know is why

14:51.200 --> 14:59.520
uh so what i want to know is why does he smell uh his fingers there is one sure fire way to stop

14:59.520 --> 15:04.240
this behavior every time he does it lean in real close to him like i'm comfortably close and just

15:04.240 --> 15:10.000
say hey can i get ahead of that next let me uh let me get hit past that past the dutchie on the

15:10.000 --> 15:16.960
left hand side don't vote on that sweet sniff um i think the reason he does it it's probably

15:16.960 --> 15:22.560
because he sounds like the worst oh no come on picture this is someone's daddy that you're

15:22.560 --> 15:29.200
close your eyes picture this in any way that's not creepy okay here you want me to give it to

15:29.200 --> 15:37.760
you the non-creepy way please what if this is some sort of patriarchal proboscis that he is using

15:38.480 --> 15:45.040
as as as an as a sensory appendage to sort of get a feel for the environment like smell

15:45.040 --> 15:50.720
a location smell a location i'm saying all this other stuff like armpit gross whatever hero

15:53.040 --> 15:58.320
this is his evolved state is that he's achieved dad smell what potential what potential reason

15:58.320 --> 16:03.680
could he possibly have for rubbing extend your extend your everyone listening at home fun

16:03.680 --> 16:08.880
highlights activity for the listeners at home extend your middle and index fingers and then

16:08.880 --> 16:14.720
rub them around your neck and then smell them what do you get i'm getting i don't get anything

16:14.720 --> 16:20.640
from that but i haven't evolved this like super sense just tweet whatever that smells like hashtag

16:20.640 --> 16:27.760
neck smell hashtag nbnbaf i i if i were this dad every time i did it i would just say like number

16:27.760 --> 16:34.080
and then days like rub my neck three days and then just go on about my business my blood pressure is

16:35.520 --> 16:42.240
110 over 75 not bad not bad i got that entirely through my extra sensory double smells

16:42.240 --> 16:48.880
maybe he's been told by a doctor or other professional that he he's loo he's gonna lose his sense of smell

16:49.520 --> 16:56.400
like it's he's got some sort of like live like your smell sense was dying like he has

16:56.400 --> 17:02.880
it's like a progressive loss of smelling and he wants to savor it all like he doesn't want to

17:02.880 --> 17:09.040
and i don't want to miss the smell you know does he work for yankee candle oh my god oh my god

17:09.040 --> 17:16.000
oh yeah wait a minute okay okay i got it he works at yankee candle but yankee candles become stale

17:16.000 --> 17:23.120
right like fresh sheets pine cones burnt apples we got it all there's no smells that we have old hair

17:24.640 --> 17:31.600
yeah we got all the smells we need we need a smell pioneer doug and doug like kicks in the door he's

17:31.600 --> 17:36.640
like i've got the new way of smells and they're like hey doug tell us about him he's like i need

17:36.640 --> 17:42.560
time to research you can't rush this guy you have one month i want a new candle on my desk in one

17:42.560 --> 17:51.120
month everything he pitches his finger and something finger i got one it's called um dad's

17:51.120 --> 18:00.560
neck no doug stash after ice cream no no that one's not gonna do it steering wheel close close

18:00.560 --> 18:06.000
finger and steering wheel nailed it you're back well this is this is this is the problem right

18:06.000 --> 18:13.280
he has this proboscis this this um this uh dad tendril right that he uses to collect his smells

18:13.280 --> 18:19.520
and bring it to his ovipositors and um that's great and all but i think he is going to experience

18:19.520 --> 18:26.240
some severe cross-contamination like every it's going to be dad neck and also your finger and

18:26.240 --> 18:30.400
like everywhere else your finger is unless he has like some sort of little bag that he carries with

18:30.400 --> 18:35.440
him that he dips his fingers in between smells to sort of cleanse the palate some kind of smell

18:35.440 --> 18:44.080
sorbet yes exactly exactly how do you think this is this is a legitimate question if you go into

18:44.080 --> 18:50.800
a clothing store they've obviously been inspired by the fashion magazines the fashions of of gay

18:50.800 --> 18:59.200

witch hunt witch hunt great and that one can have like witch hazel in it and well when you get it

20:28.320 --> 20:34.080
to the bottom just a burned poppet oh that was very sad there was a candle company that was a

20:34.080 --> 20:39.600
shark tank and they had and it was the man candle right so it was like i'm sorry was it not mandel

20:40.160 --> 20:45.360
no it was man candle because that sounds like manhandle which is a different thing that also

20:45.360 --> 20:49.600
sounds like man candy and then that smells like john candy and now that i'm thinking about it

20:49.600 --> 20:59.600
that's another good candle smell that yeah uh who's harry crumb cake um they uh uh thank you griffin

21:33.040 --> 21:41.440
stake my career on this that fart is by a enormous majority their bestseller by a by an insane

21:41.440 --> 21:50.240
majority their bestseller like 96 fart just all fart you think farts the hottest one i think

21:50.240 --> 21:55.440
farts the hottest one because we can't keep them on the shelves mr spencer if i i want them in my

21:55.440 --> 21:59.760
store well yeah you're gonna obviously the distribution channel possibilities for fart

21:59.760 --> 22:04.800
candles are infinite but not only that if i only have enough money to buy one of those candles and

22:04.800 --> 22:08.800
i know my heart of hearts i'm never ever going to patronize a establishment called man candles ever

22:08.800 --> 22:14.080
again which one of those am i gonna buy or or to put it differently which one of those am i gonna

22:14.080 --> 22:18.160
regret not buying for the rest of my life and it is of course fart candle which one do you want

22:18.160 --> 22:24.080
people to see on your shelf and if it says man candle and anything but fart yeah they're like

22:24.080 --> 22:30.880
oh that's really stupid yeah um i want to move on because we've been talking about smells for a

22:30.880 --> 22:38.880
while and i feel like smells are 50 of listening to podcasts they say um but talking about the the

22:38.880 --> 22:45.920
dad with his finger smells the toss me toss me back in time did it toss you back in time and it

22:45.920 --> 22:54.960
brought up a vivid vivid memory possibly a life-defining memory and um i was at michael's

22:54.960 --> 23:00.560
and we were all kids and justin you were there and mom had just checked out at michael's and

23:00.560 --> 23:04.800
the two of us were there she just bought some i don't know probably some cross stitch supplies

23:05.600 --> 23:09.760
and we just walked out past the register and we were in sort of the michael's breezeway

23:09.760 --> 23:15.760
and you put your fingers just like on my nose middle and index like you were doing some sort

23:15.760 --> 23:25.120
of salute only you put it right on my nose and the smell was bad it was a bad smell and you said

23:26.080 --> 23:31.920
doesn't that smell like ketchup and i said what and then i looked and you showed me that you put

23:31.920 --> 23:37.920
your fingers in your armpits and then you smelled them and you said my armpits smell a lot like

23:37.920 --> 23:46.720
ketchup and i thought it's over between the two the two of us professionally are over so one i

23:46.720 --> 23:50.080
just kind of wanted to get that story out there because i feel like talking about it is going to

23:50.080 --> 23:53.760
be the best way to move on now that it's every year that well that's your memory that's good

23:53.760 --> 23:58.160
press the hell out of that yeah i haven't apparently i have successfully until just this

23:58.160 --> 24:05.040
moment so i guess the second the second thing is um maybe this dad produces a lot of interesting

24:05.040 --> 24:11.440
smells maybe maybe maybe he got maybe his armpits do smell like a rotation of condiments maybe his

24:11.440 --> 24:18.800
mustache does smell like fart i don't know i have two questions yeah one when was this ballparking

24:18.800 --> 24:26.320
for me oh my god uh you were not as young as you probably wish you were i'm gonna say you were

24:26.320 --> 24:31.920
probably 14 years old okay so that would have put you in about seven here's one weird thing about

24:31.920 --> 24:36.720
it i was not a ketchup fan back then no no not at all i wonder how i had such a good reference point

24:36.720 --> 24:42.720
well your body's changing your body's maturing in ways you probably didn't understand oh that's a

24:42.720 --> 24:50.640
good candle smell puberty yeah yeah two uh question um for you griffin yeah did it uh can i

24:50.640 --> 24:57.280
say something yeah no homie it didn't like i think you just wanted to give someone a smell i think

24:57.280 --> 25:02.480
it was like a i think it was listen that none of the three of us picked on each other really at all

25:02.480 --> 25:08.000
and i feel like that was your feeble attempt at at a prank second muster well we did throw baseball

25:08.000 --> 25:12.400
bats at each other well that was less a prank that was that was good heart that was like pure

25:12.400 --> 25:18.800
of heart kind of yeah games we just didn't understand consequences yeah or rules or they

25:18.800 --> 25:22.400
they're the mechanics weren't sophisticated for taste my steel how about another question

25:22.400 --> 25:30.800
another question uh hi brothers i play on a sunday recreational dodgeball team and there is a uh girl

25:30.800 --> 25:36.640
on one of the teams who is beautiful time slowed down when i passed her in the gym the other day

25:36.640 --> 25:43.840
she's a warlock my team she's a she's a chronomancer it's no big deal oh she she is a

25:43.840 --> 25:48.480
lovely lady and seems like she's got a great personality and also she can dilate the universe

25:48.480 --> 25:52.960
which seems unfair in dodgeball terms yeah a little bit a little bit maybe want to talk to

25:52.960 --> 25:58.880
the uh ref on that one come on ref she's dilating the universe my team is playing against hers in

25:58.880 --> 26:04.080
three weeks how do i execute the dodgeball meet cute do i try to get her out every time

26:04.080 --> 26:09.280
catch her throws and wink as i do it please help i have you guys ever been to like an adult

26:09.280 --> 26:16.240
like uh dodgeball game uh no my friends here in california are in a dodgeball league it's

26:16.240 --> 26:25.360
it's terrifying yeah it's chaos yeah and like like i see people get seriously injured doing it

26:26.720 --> 26:33.440
i just want to make it clear it is intense and it's scary and like if you like there's no glass

26:33.440 --> 26:38.400
you know you're you're there this is like arena i should hope there's no glass well i mean like

26:38.400 --> 26:43.520
there's nothing protecting you from the action oh you the observer are worried about yeah yeah i

26:43.520 --> 26:49.280
guess so yeah yeah i guess that's a good that's a good like perfectly tense though for the moment

26:49.280 --> 26:54.800
when one comes rocking at you and you just like one hand catch it and they're like yes well that's

26:54.800 --> 27:00.800
how i became the chosen one uh more likely is a dodgeball would hit travis in his face and break

27:00.800 --> 27:05.440
every bone in his body and kill him instantly like the mom in a prayer for owen meaning

27:05.440 --> 27:18.960
wow spoilers um uh don't oh yikes it's i just don't think you you just shouldn't like you just

27:18.960 --> 27:23.520
shouldn't do this thing if you if you see someone that you are interested in like you know go up and

27:23.520 --> 27:30.480
talk to them or whatever but we we we've done almost like we've done so much of this show now

27:30.480 --> 27:39.520
and our position of don't have an artifice for your like romantic approach is pretty firm all

27:39.520 --> 27:44.880
you have to do is what you've got here and i think what makes this different from a lot

27:44.880 --> 27:51.920
of the times we've gotten this question is like you have a thing to talk about after the game is

27:51.920 --> 27:57.840
over like you you can just walk up and say hey good game like you guys did great and like start

27:57.840 --> 28:03.040
a conversation with her do you have do you want to do you want a juice box or maybe a little juice

28:03.040 --> 28:08.480
box of orange slices like you don't have to like manufacture this isn't like she works at a place

28:08.480 --> 28:14.000
and you want to like you're both there doing the same thing now the only time that you can't do

28:14.000 --> 28:21.280
this is if your team beats them like mercilessly like there's no like if they get mercyed i don't

28:21.280 --> 28:25.680
know if you can mercy someone at dodgeball and then you walk up and say hey good game yeah but

28:25.680 --> 28:33.120
don't say like that a good game good game i guess are you telling me travis are you suggesting am i

28:33.120 --> 28:40.080
hearing what i'm hearing are you saying this person needs to take a dive well are you missing

28:40.080 --> 28:47.680
their shots you gotta make it look you gotta sell it you gotta take a dive but you can't your team

28:47.680 --> 28:53.440
can't get beaten mercilessly by them it's gotta be close but they need to win by like you know

28:53.440 --> 28:59.040
one down to their last player down to two that one player takes you and the other maybe you bump

28:59.040 --> 29:04.800
the other player okay you gotta be close you're assuming his team has a winning chance at all

29:04.800 --> 29:10.960
when this woman can just point at people on your team and instantly age them 70 years yeah but she

29:10.960 --> 29:16.160
can maybe do that once or twice before the ref is gonna notice you can throw a ball at her she can

29:16.160 --> 29:22.080
turn your blood to dust yeah what chance do you have or turn you into a baby oh hey what's up

29:22.080 --> 29:27.040
good game you're looking pretty good time slows down when i'm around you my secret she says and

29:27.040 --> 29:35.440
then all of a sudden you're a baby and then you just collapse not collapse you just gotta squish

29:35.440 --> 29:40.960
to the ground baby or maybe you just get like two years older and you age out of the league

29:40.960 --> 29:44.960
but like imagine what an amazing opportunity that would be let me think about it to become a baby

29:44.960 --> 29:49.440
again just think would you have your baby again would you have your memories and like all of your

29:49.440 --> 29:54.720
experiences yeah yeah it would be like button man curious you know button man but um it would be

29:54.720 --> 29:58.640
you would have all your experiences but you would be raised by a dodgeball team

29:58.640 --> 30:03.040
would my wife be forced to care for me in this oh that's a good point can my wife become a

30:03.040 --> 30:06.400
baby too because i don't want to good question i really don't want to go through the whole

30:06.400 --> 30:10.800
the whole rigmarole all over again yeah the whole production well oh but if we could both if we

30:10.800 --> 30:15.280
could start dating from baby on oh solid how long have you how long have you and your wife been

30:15.280 --> 30:22.320
together uh about 260 years what yeah see we met this chronomancer uh in the intramural dodgeball

30:22.320 --> 30:27.200
league and she gave us basically like four trips back to the past and uh how do you guys keep it

30:27.200 --> 30:32.400
fresh well we just turned back to our like young totally bodacious bides like i don't

30:33.120 --> 30:39.200
that is of course how we keep it fresh what's your problem uh i just don't do this like don't

30:39.200 --> 30:45.520
do like i i know that you're probably setting this up for like jokes but we've realized over

30:45.520 --> 30:55.600
doing this show 264 times is that right yeah 264 times that like we there there's too much of this

30:55.600 --> 31:01.520
reality in the world like there's too much of this happening really for it to be particularly

31:01.520 --> 31:09.120
hysterical right maybe just go talk to her or don't yeah like don't don't like try to arrange

31:09.120 --> 31:15.840
or be like i played so good she's gonna notice or like oh i bumped it no just like walk over and say

31:15.840 --> 31:22.640

podcast on the internet i'd answer that by saying one we've been doing this show for over seven

37:21.120 --> 37:27.840
years long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche and two shut up sick burn i'd say

37:27.840 --> 37:32.400
that our show is more of a comedy podcast a podcast about words that sound like other words

37:32.400 --> 37:39.040
a podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one a podcast about pitches for a ziggy

37:39.040 --> 37:44.800
comic book movie or discussions about sex tarps yeah i mean mostly it's a show about three friends

37:44.800 --> 37:50.560
just hanging out and talking about ding dongs that's mostly used to wait what so if you like

37:50.560 --> 37:57.680
any of those things subscribe in itunes today or visit maximum fun.org to follow the show the

37:57.680 --> 38:05.680
flop house hello brothers my girlfriend is sick she and her family take an immune boosting supplement

38:05.680 --> 38:09.680
that dissolves into water to make a rather unpleasant citrusy drink called airborne

38:10.240 --> 38:14.800
as a stuck-up know-it-all who reads about science i'm aware there's no way to actually boost one's

38:14.800 --> 38:19.600
immune system and that whatever benefit they're getting is from uh from said dissolving tablet

38:19.600 --> 38:24.640
is pure placebo should i confront my sick girlfriend and her family about how they are

38:24.640 --> 38:29.760
being swindled out of tens of dollars every year or should i stay quiet and prevent sounding smart

38:29.760 --> 38:38.240
while they're in pain that's from not a doctor in delmar okay one and i mean this question

38:38.240 --> 38:45.920
sincerely i know that airborne doesn't like cure you or make you better but isn't getting like

38:45.920 --> 38:51.280
vitamin c and stuff good for you yes of course it is this was this is what i'm talking about this

38:51.280 --> 38:57.840
is the psych doctor mispronouncing fruit of course eating vitamins makes you healthier and it cures

38:57.840 --> 39:04.080
your sickness that's 101 stuff it doesn't cure it it does you eat a bunch of vitamins and take

39:04.080 --> 39:09.520
airborne it doesn't make you better you eat enough vitamin c and the vitamin c get into your body

39:09.520 --> 39:15.840
and they're orange when they get in there and i imagine them like bulk these big bulky spheres right

39:15.840 --> 39:21.600
like each one's a big bulky sphere and they just run and they just tackle the disease particles

39:21.600 --> 39:25.520
inside of you and then they carry them down to your bladder and throw them into your bladder

39:25.520 --> 39:31.440
like your bladder's a jail for like disease molecules and shit and then you just pee it out

39:31.440 --> 39:39.760
oh goodness that's all get sit i get sydney on the call she'll back me up on this she will not

39:42.000 --> 39:48.320
not even vitamin c either that you can take a shot of b12 and b12 i imagine more like sort of

39:49.120 --> 39:54.880
red and cylindrical like bullets like kind of like cool guys and they get into your blood right and

39:54.880 --> 39:59.280
the vines he doesn't go to your blood it's mostly in your tummy and then it's like i said throws in

39:59.280 --> 40:06.000
the the viruses in your bladder but the the b12 goes into your blood and there are these like

40:06.000 --> 40:09.920
sharp fast aerodynamic red capsules and they just kill the disease right there they don't

40:09.920 --> 40:15.520
take them to jail they just like go right griffin kill them is the b12 the loose cannon cop or is

40:15.520 --> 40:20.000
the vitamin c the loose cannon which one is like vitamin c is more just sort of like brute strength

40:20.000 --> 40:24.800
imagine them as like the offensive line for your body and your body your body your brain is the

40:24.800 --> 40:29.440
quarterback but your brain can't do the things that the functions that it needs to do if it's got a

40:29.440 --> 40:34.720
bunch of defensive linemen tackling it all the time so what do you need you need a strong barricade

40:34.720 --> 40:41.360
between them and you and that barricade is these vitamin c balls and what does wheatgrass do

40:41.360 --> 40:46.800
wheatgrass is like a sort of the offensive coach right they're not like in charge of your body

40:46.800 --> 40:51.120
because your brain is also the coach of your body but wheatgrass gets in there and it's like hey

40:51.120 --> 40:59.440
blood do better hey there bones you can stand up straighter than that um so none of this is true

40:59.440 --> 41:03.760
and so second and give me give me other healthy things you can put your body and i'll tell them

41:03.760 --> 41:08.640
exactly what they do for you because i we we now have to make up for the the pseudoscience

41:08.640 --> 41:13.440
bullshit that this person just spewed it wouldn't be a successful product if it didn't work first off

41:13.440 --> 41:24.240
no no i mean you like okay here is completely my uh just completely my uh

41:25.440 --> 41:33.120
my own experience that has nothing to do with anything uh uh sydney says that none of those

41:33.120 --> 41:42.720
work and i still take them because i believe you know you clap real hard i just like metaphorically

41:42.720 --> 41:50.960
speaking i believe that's the important thing i believe i think sydney might just have a

41:50.960 --> 41:58.560
a vitamin dragon in her body no i don't think so um i will say that you uh you should know that like

41:58.560 --> 42:04.160
you get most all the vitamins you need from like food you eat yeah but when you're sick you need

42:04.160 --> 42:11.440
extra vitamins right don't you don't cause you that when you're okay i'm not saying airborne

42:11.440 --> 42:16.320
cures anyone here i want to make that clear airborne literally you feel bad literally had

42:16.320 --> 42:22.960
to pay 30 million dollars because they said they were a cold busting formula and they don't bust

42:22.960 --> 42:27.600
shit well they don't but when you feel bad is because you don't have enough vitamins in your

42:27.600 --> 42:32.240
body it's like when your battery's weird down right right and you gotta put in new batteries

42:32.240 --> 42:35.840
to feel better oh that's a good point travis i didn't even mention that when these vitamin c

42:35.840 --> 42:44.320
c these super muscular vitamin c defenders get into your body they don't just like attack the

42:44.320 --> 42:49.440
the they don't just grab onto the viruses and like pull them down out of your body they also charge

42:49.440 --> 42:54.560
you up and they get you feeling really good and so if you're ever tired whenever did you guys know

42:54.560 --> 42:58.320
everybody goes to sleep every night everybody knows that what you may not know is that if you

42:58.320 --> 43:03.360
just keep taking vitamin c throughout the day you can stay awake forever and don't don't the

43:03.360 --> 43:08.640
fluorescent lights the fluorescent lights steal one of your vitamins right yes the rights take

43:08.640 --> 43:12.640
like vitamin k or something like that they get one of those great vitamins they pull the potassium

43:12.640 --> 43:19.120
out of your body you know what in my life one of my biggest disappointments as an adult is that

43:19.840 --> 43:25.600
this concept of like health potions and stuff that i developed from playing like zelda yeah that

43:25.600 --> 43:31.360
there is no like i always thought like coffee would be a thing that like i feel down you drink

43:31.360 --> 43:36.160
it and you feel like whoop whoop yeah and it would be like magic you know or like when you

43:36.160 --> 43:40.320
felt bad if there was some kind of medicine you could take where it's like oh i feel great uh

43:42.720 --> 43:50.880
fish oil fish oil travis imagine your body is just a series of water slides taking

43:50.880 --> 43:55.360
okay nutrients from point a to point b i don't know why your body decides to produce these

43:55.360 --> 44:00.720
nutrients at the opposite place from where they are required but just stay with me your body's

44:00.720 --> 44:06.960
a series of water slides blood slides food slides bone slides muscle slides right and

44:06.960 --> 44:10.640
it's all nerve your nervous system's just a bunch of slides for electricity okay

44:14.240 --> 44:21.280
so that's that is i'm with that's just all true and imagine that you are uh let's just say like

44:21.280 --> 44:26.240
a potassium protein on a bone slide getting ready to go oh they need me down the tibia better get

44:26.240 --> 44:33.040
down there and you hop in but then you you hear like a noise and you feel a discomfort in your

44:33.040 --> 44:37.520
thighs because there's no water there's no water running down this slide i'm trying to get down

44:37.520 --> 44:42.240
the tibia there's no way i'll make it down there because this this isn't slippery at all fish oil

44:42.240 --> 44:48.160
is the water for the water slides of your body okay you just splice splashes on there and then

44:48.160 --> 44:56.960
we down you go and it's good for your your myelin sheaves all of that is all of that is textbook

44:56.960 --> 45:01.760
true so moving on ready for it maybe a yahoo justin what's it seems like i wasn't really

45:01.760 --> 45:08.640
engaging you with my with my tails it's just your lie i mean it's just lies it's like and it's not

45:08.640 --> 45:12.800
like a goofy thing either it's not like you're telling people lies about like their car like

45:12.800 --> 45:17.200
a little extra sugar in there will really help the engine like yeah i mean yes but like it's

45:17.200 --> 45:22.720
their wet human body like what if they take it seriously hold on now i don't want to jump in

45:22.720 --> 45:30.480
here with my pseudoscience but i truly believe that if you hit like maximum like potential

45:30.480 --> 45:37.840
vitamin intake you can body jump sure that's what the movie looper was about right exactly

45:38.400 --> 45:46.160
that's how they avoided the uh i can't even say it uh do you guys want a yahoo yeah uh yeah this

45:46.160 --> 45:52.080
yahoo was sent in by game recognized game rachel spurling thank you rachel it's by yahoo answers

45:52.080 --> 46:03.120
user abdul who asks how do the ufc get your number i was just wait i was just wondering

46:03.120 --> 46:09.120

47:02.800 --> 47:09.920
montage montage montage you're in the fight um how do you but but this is this this fun fantasy

47:09.920 --> 47:13.840
that we just whipped up is just that unfortunately justin it's just a fantasy because i don't think

47:13.840 --> 47:20.960
you are in the ufc rolo decks yeah well i i tweet my number to pretty much everybody in the ufc so

47:20.960 --> 47:25.280
they should be able to find it with a little bit of googling justin when you turned 18 did you

47:25.280 --> 47:32.640
register with the selective usd service yesterday when you were 11 did an owl come down your chimney

47:32.640 --> 47:40.640
congratulations justin you're a punctured a what you're a punctured airy you gotta go study at

47:40.640 --> 47:46.240
punch wards we're not very creative with the fiction come with me to punch it on alley it's

47:46.240 --> 47:52.000
where you'll buy all your fighting supplies this alley sucks this alley this alley is just people

beating the shit out of each other in an alley have fun here he goes back and he's during the

47:58.400 --> 48:03.280
summer he's like accidentally uses his powers of the dursleys which i'm by which i mean he becomes

48:03.280 --> 48:09.840
abusive and just hits them like no you suck like this sucks you're pushing our aunt and now you're

48:09.840 --> 48:14.880
punching dirt dudley now harry i have to tell you when you were a baby you were attacked by he who

48:14.880 --> 48:20.560
must not be punched no you don't you don't understand that with dementors you punch each of

48:20.560 --> 48:27.120
them like 16 times yeah dementor would like get in front of them and then he would dissipate just as

48:27.120 --> 48:31.600
my punch was going to connect with his spectral body but my punch would go through because that's

48:31.600 --> 48:35.760
how i learned how to punch you punch you punch through the target and then my aunt was on the

48:35.760 --> 48:41.040
other side and i cast expecto punch tronum you just put your keys between your fingers that's a

48:41.040 --> 48:46.880
spell it's a spell and let me tell you something i'm feeling pretty magical right now

48:46.880 --> 48:53.200
how officer officer tumble doors

48:55.360 --> 49:01.360
uh how does the eoc get turned over they probably just call people until they find somebody who

49:01.360 --> 49:05.520
knows you right oh you think it's cold calls yeah like do you know somebody who knows somebody who

49:05.520 --> 49:10.720
knows dana white hey can you put me in touch with justin mcgroy i've heard good stuff but i can't

49:10.720 --> 49:16.240
seem to find his contact anywhere no i'm saying there's a phone tree dana white calls two people

49:16.240 --> 49:20.880
they each call two people and eventually that spirals out until he gets the person he wants

49:20.880 --> 49:25.040
is what i'm saying to you i was picturing like a call center where people were like just like

49:25.040 --> 49:28.880
ringing your number and saying hello this is deborah calling to see if you might be interested

49:28.880 --> 49:33.360
in punching people for money oh you don't have time for the call i understand is there a time

49:33.360 --> 49:37.520
that we could call you back later about punching people for money i'm getting this um i'm getting

49:37.520 --> 49:42.880
this uh uh recently i've been getting this telemarketing call and it's a robo call i guess

49:42.880 --> 49:48.560
uh uh uh where a man just says in a very authoritative voice as soon as i answer the

49:48.560 --> 49:56.720
first thing he says is do not hang up the phone and it's like that is not usually my first instance

49:56.720 --> 50:03.760
like like i answered hello hello oh god what you don't just sell me on not hanging up on you

50:03.760 --> 50:09.520
instantly like that that battle's won i got i got a recorded message the other day in which they had

50:09.520 --> 50:18.320
recorded in us and irms and stuff to make it sound and it was like uh hey this is like you know what

50:18.320 --> 50:23.920
deborah again hey this uh hey this is deborah calling uh i was just calling to see if you

50:23.920 --> 50:29.760
might be interested in a cruise and i was like what uh and hung up i was very off but you

50:30.720 --> 50:34.800
glad you cracked that case though try before it was too late you could have been having a very

50:34.800 --> 50:39.600
a very uh sobering moment out there on the keys where you just sit up you look out the

50:39.600 --> 50:46.560
porthole and say wait a minute that was a robot for too long they can track you right um do you

50:46.560 --> 50:51.280
guys ever think about what your ufc fighting specialty would be because that's what's so

50:51.280 --> 50:56.880
striking to me about the ufc is that there's just there there are so many different ways to fight

50:56.880 --> 51:01.600
another person there are a lot of people there are a lot of punchers there's a lot of throwers

51:01.600 --> 51:05.840
there's a lot of grabbers there's a lot a really popular one is like a twisties like a twisty

51:05.840 --> 51:09.760
situation where you grab a person and you just twist them all up and you twist yourself around

51:09.760 --> 51:14.320
them and they don't know they try to punch you but they're trying to use your arm because they

51:14.320 --> 51:19.920
don't know who's where they stop and where you begin i think i i would probably be recognized

51:19.920 --> 51:25.600
as like a mind changer you don't want to punch me hit once what you don't want to be that's what i

51:25.600 --> 51:29.440
thought that's what you're like a mentalist no i mean like i get punched once and i'm just like

51:29.440 --> 51:33.840
oh no wait i don't want to do this anymore oh i thought oh no no no sorry sorry let me out please

51:33.840 --> 51:40.480
open the door please please open the door let me out i would probably do something pretty manipulative

51:40.480 --> 51:47.520
like i would probably do sort of a runaway jury style calling people who know him and convincing

51:47.520 --> 51:53.280
them that i'm a good dude and then tell them like hey if you really think i'm a good dude could you

51:53.280 --> 51:57.040
pass that on to punch and darryl my opponent for this week and they're like sure no problem then

51:57.040 --> 52:01.520
do i get in the ring he's like man i've heard from a lot of people you're a solid guy i'm not

52:01.520 --> 52:06.800
going to be able to punch you and as soon as he finishes that sentence i turn it to him and i rear

52:06.800 --> 52:12.960
my fist back right like and really flex my muscles and say like i can't punch you either and the ufc

52:12.960 --> 52:18.080
is like what you've solved the riddle and dana white comes out gives me a billion dollars in

52:18.080 --> 52:24.640
the key and he puts me in the walk of vader and we fly out the roof of the place because i solved

52:24.640 --> 52:28.720
it he's raised and put the lights come on is there's just mannequins in the crowd

52:30.000 --> 52:34.560
run it ronda rousey's like where's my where's my money for for the fight where's where's all

52:34.560 --> 52:42.720
the payments that you owe me for the fights and daniel white says you get nothing you lose you

52:42.720 --> 52:48.080
punched the other woman in the face you stole fizzy lifting drink you get nothing good day ronda

52:48.960 --> 52:52.960
that does explain why ronda rousey floated up through the giant fan at the end of her last

52:52.960 --> 53:00.240
how she burped yes travis still have gotten not gotten much traction for my let's organize a

53:00.240 --> 53:04.160
pokemon fight between griffin and ronda rousey although i do have this theory you guys want to

53:04.160 --> 53:08.560
hear it she's obviously the best fighter in the whole world right now um and i'm starting to think

53:08.560 --> 53:13.760
her poke knowledge sort of plays into that because she sees someone coming at her with a kick and

53:13.760 --> 53:19.760
like she has this like built-in matrix of strengths and weaknesses in her brain for real life fighting

53:19.760 --> 53:24.480
and i think that matrix was developed over years and years memorizing type matchups in the pokemon

53:24.480 --> 53:29.040
universe so someone goes for a kick she immediately thinks like may chan and like or she has like a

53:29.040 --> 53:36.000
maybe it's like a um uh mnemonic device where she's like kick kick kick mon chan

53:36.880 --> 53:42.400
that's not one of the names i've just brought shame to myself and my family uh listen that's

53:42.400 --> 53:47.360
gonna do it for us on our podcast we hope you've had a lot of fun we know we have uh really enjoyed

53:47.360 --> 53:53.280

53:53.280 --> 53:58.000

and say a special congratulations to uh dan and elliot from the flop house who just did their uh

54:32.080 --> 54:35.840
