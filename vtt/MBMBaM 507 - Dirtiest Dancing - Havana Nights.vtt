00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show from the

00:48.080 --> 00:54.000
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother, Travis

00:54.000 --> 01:01.920
McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and boys, you know, we're still kind of

01:01.920 --> 01:10.240
in the tough times. Oh, really? Could turn around any minute. It could flip it in a minute, but

01:10.240 --> 01:16.560
right now we're, oh, by the way, Travis pointed out, it's 420, so blades one for the big dog.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.200
What are you waiting for? Now let's move on. We're all hurting for communication,

01:21.200 --> 01:27.600
I think. We're all trying to reach out and touch souls whilst keeping our human bodies six feet

01:27.600 --> 01:38.400
apart. And that can be tough. And digital is helping a lot, I would say. A lot of people

01:38.400 --> 01:42.400
are using digital to talk to each other, and I think that that's important. And I just wanted

01:42.400 --> 01:48.720
to share with you all, this is hot off the presses, this came in about 24 minutes ago

01:48.720 --> 01:55.600
on my phone, and this was a text I got from a West Virginia area code number. So I don't know

01:55.600 --> 01:59.600
who they are, but it's nice to know, you know, we have some of the same background. We both love

01:59.600 --> 02:04.880
Tudor's Biscuit World, you know, like that's a soul connection right there. Go herd and like

02:04.880 --> 02:11.440
bleed green and like pepperoni rolls and like Jim Justice, right? So like, I know that we have that

02:11.440 --> 02:17.680
in common. And anyway, they texted me and it looks like 19 friends that also are in the 304 area code

02:17.680 --> 02:22.480
and have sequential phone numbers, which is a fucking wild coincidence, but I feel the soul

02:22.480 --> 02:27.200
connection with all of them. And they did say in this text message, and there is a link here,

02:27.200 --> 02:34.640
I haven't clicked on it yet. But the text message says, see my juicy cream pie, and then says PUS

02:34.640 --> 02:44.880
dollar sign Y, and online now, and then there's a white mouse emoji, and then a gray mouse face

02:44.880 --> 02:50.880
emoji, and then just a black hole mouse emoji. Now Griffin, are you certain that they're mice

02:50.880 --> 02:57.920
and not perhaps cats? No, these are mice for sure, Trav. These are little mice that like the kind

02:57.920 --> 03:04.560
they live in the walls, Trav. And so me and 19 friends, new friends, I would say, because a text

03:04.560 --> 03:10.720
from a stranger is just a friend you haven't made yet. And they do want us to come see the juicy

03:10.720 --> 03:17.920
juicy cream pie PUS dollar sign Y online now. Kind of like Kesha a little bit there. Yeah,

03:17.920 --> 03:23.600
it's putting a fun flare on it. And I have to say, I want to say real quick, I really appreciate

03:23.600 --> 03:30.480
them obfuscating the P word, because my daughter could be reading this. Thank you so much for

03:30.480 --> 03:36.640
censoring that. Is there some kind of spam sensor out there, but if they hadn't censored out,

03:36.640 --> 03:42.800
the phone would be like, Oh, and wouldn't allow it through. Well, I got net and I did download

03:42.800 --> 03:50.960
net nanny on my iPhone. Keep protect yourself to protect yourself and my chastity. So my favorite

03:50.960 --> 03:56.080
thing about this and the genuine real soul. So if I could step outside the bed, the real soul

03:56.080 --> 04:01.040
connection I feel is with one of these people. I do not know them. They do have a 304 area code

04:01.040 --> 04:13.280
number pretty close to mine. They went ahead and they disliked this text. Which basically,

04:13.280 --> 04:18.000
which fills me with joy as if whoever sent that first message is going to see that and be like,

04:18.000 --> 04:23.840
Oh man, I really thought they would like that one. I really thought that just for them.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.960
I put in the mice and everything. I was going to do a funny bit where like I pretended to

04:28.960 --> 04:34.720
not know what some of the words in the text meant, but then you got to the emoji part and I was

04:34.720 --> 04:42.400
literally like lost. I was lost. Why the mice? Why the mice, I guess.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.720
It's like a Cinderella thing. You know what I mean?

04:45.920 --> 04:48.320
These are the mice that stitch the crotchless panties.

04:48.320 --> 04:53.760
But see, you've introduced already a cat kind of imagery.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.120
Yeah, that's true.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.280
And then you introduce mice and I'm getting turned around.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.920
I do just want to say that, and this will be the fourth of it,

05:04.560 --> 05:12.320
but if you do say cream pie on your podcast five times, then Apple deletes the whole show.

05:12.320 --> 05:20.400
So let's try it. And that worries me because we usually drop one or two of those words together

05:20.400 --> 05:27.120
like per episode, tangentially, not related to this beautiful piece of communication I got from

05:27.120 --> 05:28.480
a new kindred spirit.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.200
So have you thought about writing back Griffin?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.280
No, I didn't.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.400
I didn't think about that.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.080
Maybe I don't think it has to be committal. I think you could write back like,

05:38.080 --> 05:41.440
I'm not interested in clicking the link, but how are you today?

05:41.440 --> 05:45.200
I mean, I can also just text back like what's with the mouse?

05:45.200 --> 05:48.800
Like I understand you and your whole deal, but what's with the mouse emojis though?

05:48.800 --> 05:53.440
Yeah, you know what? I'd like to talk about some digital communication,

05:53.440 --> 05:56.800
unprompted digital communication I received too, because you're so right, Griffin.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.320
It's really important these times.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.920
I touched earlier on how some brands are looking out for us.

06:03.360 --> 06:08.240
First off, let me just say a quick thank you to all the Justin McElroys on earth

06:08.240 --> 06:12.960
that when you want to give someone a fake email address, you give them mine.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.160
I don't know how you keep doing it, but I really appreciate hearing from all the

06:16.160 --> 06:24.080
different Justin McElroys all over. And I got an email from Smyrna, Chevrolet,

06:24.640 --> 06:28.160
which is somewhere. I have no idea where, not where I live.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.440
In Smyrna, I imagine.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.520
I would assume it's near Smyrna.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.880
New Smyrna Beach, Florida, I got this email.

06:34.880 --> 06:39.200
And the subject line of the email is just this, our dealership is still open.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.360
So that's a kind of belligerent statement of purpose.

06:43.360 --> 06:48.640
So then right below it starts with this, rest assured, our dealership is open.

06:49.520 --> 06:53.120
And it says, this is what they've gone with for an opener.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.920
Uncertainty is everywhere.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.520
We are certainly ready to assist you.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.080
Cool.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.760
So that is so interesting.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.240
That's badass. God, that makes me feel good.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.120
That really makes me feel like we're about to turn the corner on this whole fucking enterprise.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.120
It's nice to have one foothold in the whole thing, you know?

07:11.120 --> 07:14.720
Like, well, at least new Smyrna, Ford, was there, Chevrolet?

07:14.720 --> 07:17.440
It's a Chevy, Travis. It's got a hemming.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.760
So you know that they're there for you.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.440
And here's a really exciting thing.

07:21.440 --> 07:26.560
If you've been waiting for the exact right time to buy a vehicle and thinking that this is it,

07:27.120 --> 07:30.800
they got a first responder discount through June 30th.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.840
Yeah, it's really nice.

07:31.840 --> 07:38.000
It lists who it's here for, police, fire, EMTs, 911, medical professionals.

07:38.000 --> 07:38.720
So that's cool.

07:38.720 --> 07:43.920
And dentists and optometrists and veterinarians.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.240
Okay.

07:46.240 --> 07:52.160
And exercise and massage techs and chiropractors and dieticians.

07:52.160 --> 07:52.640
Okay.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.640
So first responder dieticians, I have good news for you.

07:56.640 --> 08:00.080
If you've been waiting for the right time to buy a great new Chevrolet vehicle,

08:00.080 --> 08:01.120
your moment has arrived.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.600
And thank you for your service.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.320
I love it when you burst into rooms and just like,

08:06.320 --> 08:08.640
huh, someone's macros are off.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.600
It's an emergency.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.880
Someone's got to up their protein.

08:12.880 --> 08:13.360
I'm here.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.120
Someone needs their spine aligned and I'm the one here to do it.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.680
First responder dieticians, thank you for everything you've done for us.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.480
Your bravery.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.200
Let's help some people.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.280
I feel like the world needs us now more than ever.

08:30.080 --> 08:30.640
I recently started-

08:30.640 --> 08:33.200
We're kind of like first responders if you think about it.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.440
It says, and others.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.320
I bet if you roll in there and you're like,

08:39.440 --> 08:41.680
I'm a first responding entertainer.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.240
I'm still on the front lines of comedy and I would try to make jokes in this world.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.040
So I would like a discount on a brand new Chevrolet.

08:49.040 --> 08:49.520
Yeah, of course.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.080
That sounds terrible.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.520
Here's a free Chevy.

08:51.520 --> 08:52.880
Here's a free Chevy for you.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.240
Thank you so much for coming in.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.280
You knew we were open.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.080
I did.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.040
Thank you for the email.

08:58.960 --> 09:03.840
I recently started working for a food delivery company where my thank you for your actual

09:03.840 --> 09:12.240
service keeping our actual republic functioning where my earnings depend on tips.

09:12.240 --> 09:16.720
Most customers ask that I leave the goods outside their door to avoid physical contact.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.760
Love this.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.600
I totally respect that, but it eliminates that moment of human connection that reminds

09:21.600 --> 09:25.120
them how I'm putting myself at risk so they can have a burrito.

09:25.120 --> 09:29.040
What can I text customers after delivery to remind them to tip me?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.520
That's from doing you a favor, TM.

09:31.520 --> 09:38.080
Oh, yeah, I guess that probably clears up the mystery of which service we're talking about.

09:40.080 --> 09:48.800
Who is still getting food delivery and not tipping like a mortgage payment?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.080
Yeah, I've seen them out.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.640
It seems like that should be customary.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.440
And you see, you know, have you seen the news reports of people

09:56.160 --> 09:58.560
switching their tips out at the last second after using it?

09:58.560 --> 09:59.840
Oh, come on.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.560
Oh, that's bad.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.760
Oh, you monsters.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.400
Don't do that.

10:03.120 --> 10:07.600
But I do appreciate the text that says, like, hey, I dropped the stuff at your door.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.640
Go get it before the carrion birds do.

10:10.640 --> 10:15.600
And I go outside and without fail, the carrion birds have gotten away with my egg rolls.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.720
Every time?

10:16.720 --> 10:18.240
Every time they just go for the egg rolls.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.840
They don't go for the Mongolian beef.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.920
They mostly focus on the egg rolls.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.520
Is it the spice level, do you think?

10:24.720 --> 10:26.240
Yes, they have very sensitive stomachs.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.480
And I appreciate the text saying like, hey, go get them.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.680
But is there a version of that text that's like, hey, go get them.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.280
And I'm really putting myself at risk.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.520
It looks like your house is covered in pathogens.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.320
What about this?

10:40.320 --> 10:45.120
What about you're waiting for your burrito to arrive and then you hear, is that music?

10:45.760 --> 10:50.080
And you go outside and you open your front door and there is a masked figure

10:50.640 --> 10:53.920
standing in your driveway with a boombox above their head.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.800
And it's just playing, here's your food.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.560
It's time to eat.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.000
Here's your food.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.120
It's such a treat.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.760
And it's like, wow, that's a lot of service.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.880
I really appreciate that.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.160
I'm going to tip this person.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.520
This fuggie.

11:07.520 --> 11:12.640
Do you realize we're in a world where like actual mass delivery people like come from

11:12.640 --> 11:16.480
the outlands to bring us supplies except they're burritos?

11:17.200 --> 11:19.040
It's weird right now, I think.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.480
I think things are weird.

11:20.480 --> 11:20.960
You know what?

11:20.960 --> 11:22.320
You know what needs to make a comeback?

11:22.320 --> 11:26.480
I've just decided based off of, you said hear music, Justin, and it got me thinking.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.000
Like an organ grinder's monkey, right?

11:30.000 --> 11:30.480
Okay.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.160
Because you leave the burrito there, they open the door, there's a monkey.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.080
The monkey tips its little hat, maybe holds its hand out.

11:38.080 --> 11:42.800
You hand him a $10 bill and he scurries back up on the delivery person's shoulder a good

11:42.800 --> 11:44.000
12 feet away.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.160
The monkey can get so sick though, Trav.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.600
Well, yeah, I don't think so.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.480
Monkeys are fairly cold blooded and so I think they're actually pretty good transmission

11:54.480 --> 11:55.520
factors for disease.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.600
So a monkey is not great.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.000
How about an organ grinder's robot?

12:00.000 --> 12:05.200
There's a little Roomba there and the Roomba tips his little hat and then vacuums your

12:05.200 --> 12:07.360
sidewalk back to the delivery person.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.560
That's good.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.920
And you don't even have to do it.

12:09.920 --> 12:15.760
You can just shatter a Roomba on their front porch when you leave their food there and

12:15.760 --> 12:21.360
you text them like, hey, my delivery Roomba died for your duck fat fries.

12:21.360 --> 12:26.240
So just keep that in mind when you hit the old tipperino, huh?

12:26.800 --> 12:27.680
It is a...

12:27.680 --> 12:31.040
I have really been struggling lately with when I get...

12:31.040 --> 12:33.680
This is taking it from the other perspective.

12:33.680 --> 12:38.560
When I do get a food delivery, I'm sitting in the room where...

12:38.560 --> 12:42.240
Almost always sitting in the room that has a clear line of vision to the front door.

12:42.240 --> 12:47.520
Uh-huh, so I have really been struggling with what to do in that.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.560
I really...

12:48.560 --> 12:54.320
I have alternated between like standing behind the door and just like nodding my approval,

12:54.320 --> 12:57.200
I guess, to actively hiding.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.160
That's another one.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.560
Just like getting clear of sight lines.

13:00.560 --> 13:05.840
I worry that even though I do have the like leave on porch message there, I worry if I'm

13:05.840 --> 13:10.720
too close to the door that they'll want to do a handoff and I don't want that.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.800
I don't want that for either of you, yeah.

13:13.440 --> 13:18.800
This is a true thing that happened to me 100% and it sounds, I know, like a scary story,

13:18.800 --> 13:19.840
but it really happened.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.240
We ordered food and we left...

13:23.440 --> 13:30.800
The instructions were leave food on porch, but I was taking the garbage cans around front

13:30.800 --> 13:32.880
at the exact time that they pulled up.

13:33.920 --> 13:39.760
So then I just stood in the driveway and said out loud, I'll just wait and let you leave

13:39.760 --> 13:42.640
it on the porch and I stood there.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.880
What was I gonna do?

13:44.880 --> 13:48.480
Go over and get it or say like, you stay there, let me go in the house and pretend like I

13:48.480 --> 13:49.360
wasn't out here.

13:50.400 --> 13:55.040
You wave at them and you say, hey, I'm the neighbor and I'm stealing their garbage cans

13:55.040 --> 13:56.640
and you walk back behind the house.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.080
The three of us are so bad at human contact.

14:00.080 --> 14:03.440
The three of us are so, so, so bad at human contact.

14:03.440 --> 14:07.840
How can we be fucking this up now of all times?

14:07.840 --> 14:08.800
This should be our time to shine.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.280
We should be thriving right now.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.600
I think it, you know why?

14:13.600 --> 14:18.160
I think I'm fucking it up because on some level, I just want to open the door and fucking

14:18.160 --> 14:18.960
chat for a second.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.800
I would love to chat with you.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.080
That is the fucking impulse that I am fighting in my head.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.720
You should see me at the grocery store as they're doing checkout.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.480
I'm not gonna stay any longer than I need to.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.200
And I'm not, I'm gonna keep blind moving.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.160
Everybody here is taking a risk and I want to get everybody home safely.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.360
But while you're scanning those groceries, we are gonna have a little talk.

14:37.360 --> 14:43.920
You and me, I bet our nation's checkout clerks are fucking done.

14:43.920 --> 14:44.400
Okay?

14:44.400 --> 14:44.960
I know.

14:44.960 --> 14:45.440
I know.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.560
I've heard all of your wonderful stories.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.280
Okay?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.000
Stop it.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.560
I'm done.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.360
I'm cashed.

14:51.360 --> 14:58.400
I, the other day during my like unfortunate but necessary shopping trip said the phrase,

14:58.400 --> 15:00.480
this is a pretty cool plexiglass shield, huh?

15:00.480 --> 15:01.600
When they put that in.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.640
Oh, thanks Travis.

15:02.640 --> 15:08.720
I just needed to communicate to a human being that wasn't in my house.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.360
Did you catch a survivor last night?

15:12.720 --> 15:16.720
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by The Prospect or Merritt Palmer.

15:18.720 --> 15:24.800
It is from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm gonna say their name is Gerald Me.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.240
It's like Jeremy and Gerald, but they fused like in Dragon Ball Z.

15:28.240 --> 15:32.080
Oh, I thought it was a catchphrase where you'd say like Gerald Me.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.480
Oh, Gerald Me asks-

15:34.480 --> 15:35.760
Hit me with that Gerald.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.800
I prank called Apple and Microsoft.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.760
Will they ever answer my calls again for when I really need them?

15:43.040 --> 15:43.920
Additional details.

15:43.920 --> 15:49.440
Any non-serious answers will be reported for Jpree.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.520
And that's actually a, there's a drop down there and you can click this.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.800
This one's too, this one's, they're cutting up too much in this one.

15:56.800 --> 15:57.040
Please kick them off.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.800
I'm gonna change my Twitter bio to that.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.360
Any non-serious answers will be reported.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.120
If I ask a question on Twitter and give me a non-serious answer, you will be reported.

16:05.120 --> 16:05.680
That's pretty good.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.480
So I did, I prank called Apple and Microsoft.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.840
It was very, very funny.

16:09.840 --> 16:16.160
I called them and said that, you know, my phone started to cuss at my parents

16:16.160 --> 16:18.400
in the middle of the night or something funny like that.

16:19.200 --> 16:24.480
And then, but now, but now my phone has started to get very, very hot

16:24.480 --> 16:28.720
and it's only getting hotter and I don't think they're gonna take my calls.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.000
Is that a concern?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.840
Well, it's especially bad if you're like,

16:31.840 --> 16:34.800
oh yeah, my phone started farting all the time.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.080
And then your phone does start farting all the time.

16:38.080 --> 16:38.960
Yeah, sure.

16:38.960 --> 16:43.440
Oh, cause there's no way there's then you're the, you know, the person who cried fart.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.960
And no one's ever gonna believe that.

16:44.960 --> 16:50.160
Wouldn't be surprised if that did start happening with all of these crapple devices.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.040
Android for life.

16:51.040 --> 16:51.920
I love them.

16:51.920 --> 16:56.800
I love this little guy and I can play all my emulators on them.

16:56.800 --> 17:05.040
I am worried that Apple and Microsoft are gonna take my calls.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.960
Well, especially when you're just calling to chat.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.600
You know what I mean?

17:07.600 --> 17:12.240
I just need to talk to someone.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.000
That's the bigger concern at this point is I'll call Microsoft and be like,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.680
oh, hey, Clippy died.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.840
And then they'll be like, oh, this again?

17:19.840 --> 17:23.040
I'll be like, yeah, I know I called you yesterday to talk about Survivor,

17:23.040 --> 17:26.720
but Clippy is dead and I need to download him again.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.200
So where does he come from?

17:30.640 --> 17:32.320
Where did I get Clippy first?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.480
And can I visit that website a second time?

17:34.480 --> 17:37.920
This is why we need Bonzi Buddy more than ever to try to fill that gap,

17:37.920 --> 17:39.280
but he's nowhere to be found.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.040
I'd love to talk to Bonzi Buddy right now.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.120
I miss Clippy.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.200
We're our nation's chat robots during this time.

17:45.200 --> 17:45.760
Thank you.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.480
Could you chat with people on online somewhere?

17:50.480 --> 17:53.360
Like is there, not chat online, but you know, I know people are doing that.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.400
They'll get me wrong.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.040
But people who-

17:55.040 --> 17:55.440
Wait, where?

17:56.560 --> 17:58.000
If you go to chatroom.com.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.040
Oh, yeah.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.320
Oh, this is all, oh, this is, oh, this is very NSFW.

18:04.320 --> 18:04.720
Yeah.

18:04.720 --> 18:05.600
Oh, boy.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.000
I just threw that address out there.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.120
Is it bad?

18:09.120 --> 18:09.520
Let's see.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.320
Hold on, let me look.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.000
My computer stopped responding.

18:12.000 --> 18:12.960
Oh, boy.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.440
I just bought a silencer for a rifle.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.520
I don't even know how I did that.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.880
Don't go to that website.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.160
I don't know what just happened, but it was bad on this podcast.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.200
Travis, I said no.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.000
But it says that attackers might be trying to steal my information.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.080
Don't go to that website.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.360
But now I have to get in.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.200
No, you have to get out.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.280
I have to, Justin, you know what?

18:33.280 --> 18:34.240
I'm going to take the risk.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.200
Let's go in.

18:35.200 --> 18:35.760
Oh, no.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.200
I'm being pulled into the screen.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.360
Now he's in a reboot situation.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.880
Captain, Captain N, the game master.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.160
My brother is Captain N.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.720
And it is me, the real Travis.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.560
I don't think it is.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.720
Can we just stick to one fucking topic for a second?

18:52.720 --> 18:55.040
Yo, this is feeling loosey-goosey this episode.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.080
I like it.

18:56.080 --> 18:59.440
Microsoft and Apple won't take their calls because they did too many prank calls.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.080
Yeah, Microsoft and Apple are my friends.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.600
Do you guys ever have prank calls?

19:03.600 --> 19:05.760
I'm trying to pretend to be computer brother.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.280
No, we did that one.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.000
It was good.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.320
But I feel like we didn't live in it long enough, you know?

19:10.320 --> 19:12.240
How are we going to get the next big thing?

19:12.240 --> 19:15.600
Do you guys ever have prank calls that had real world repercussions that you didn't expect?

19:15.600 --> 19:17.600
I've never prank called anyone in my entire life.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.080
Come on.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.560
I have a very distinct voice, Justin McElroy.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.120
Oh, sure.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.960
Everybody recognizes you from podcasts.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.280
Right.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.440
I mean, but I've never done it.

19:29.440 --> 19:35.520
I've always been, let's put the tiger on the table and yell at it, a scared little dork.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.080
I was too scared to do it.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.200
I was afraid I would call and they would say, I'm an adult and you're a kid,

19:41.200 --> 19:44.320
and now I'm mad at you, and I would just have to live in that moment forever.

19:44.320 --> 19:49.600
And all the dorms at Marshall had landlines back when I was in college,

19:49.600 --> 19:51.520
and they all had some variety.

19:51.520 --> 19:57.120
I mean, you could guess the numbers because they're all very small variations on each other.

19:57.120 --> 20:02.000
So we would call dorms and do, this is not particularly funny,

20:02.000 --> 20:07.280
but we would do radio calling contests and have them do trivia and stuff like that,

20:07.280 --> 20:08.800
and guess the thing and they get a prize.

20:09.360 --> 20:13.040
And for some reason, some people got really upset about it

20:13.040 --> 20:16.240
and started putting signs up in the dorm,

20:16.240 --> 20:20.480
warning people if you get a call from Rod and Todd in the mornings,

20:20.480 --> 20:25.440
they are not real DJs and you should not disclose any personal information to them.

20:25.440 --> 20:29.200
And I didn't, I never wanted it to go that far, ever, never.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.720
That's not what Rod and Todd are about, honestly.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.520
It's supposed to be a fun time for your morning commute.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.160
It wasn't about fishing for information.

20:38.160 --> 20:38.800
Thank you.

20:38.800 --> 20:43.440
One time I prank called Daniel Whitney.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.360
He's a comedian.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.720
And I called him, and like my thing back then was I did this character

20:50.720 --> 20:53.200
where I'd be like, I talk like this, hey.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.640
And then I would say sometimes like, I would say something offensive

20:56.640 --> 20:58.480
and then I would be like, get her done.

20:59.120 --> 21:03.280
And he stole it and started to call himself Larry the Cable Guy.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.480
Whoa.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.960
And that could have been, guys, that could have been me.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.640
Wow. But I prank called him

21:08.640 --> 21:11.840
and did the get her done thing and he just fucking stole it.

21:11.840 --> 21:16.480
And now he's Larry the Cable Guy and he's in Cars 1, 2, and 3, so.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.600
That could have been you, Griffin.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.360
It could have been me sliding doors.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.240
His real name's Daniel Whitney.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.120
Awesome, awesome.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.880
Hey, let's all go to Larry the Cable Guy's great stand up comedy sets

21:30.880 --> 21:34.080
and just yell like, that was a good one, Daniel.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.920
Great joke, Danny.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.000
Take off the grease paint and show us your real face.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.680
If anybody's still doing sets right now, it's Larry the Cable Guy.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.040
I wonder what he is up to.

21:47.040 --> 21:47.600
I'm going to check on him.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.160
I wonder if he's doing any like Zoom sets, you know?

21:50.160 --> 21:51.520
Like buy a ticket and you can watch.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.640
Oh, I bet his background game is fucking on point.

21:54.640 --> 21:55.200
So funny.

21:55.200 --> 21:55.520
That is good.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.560
It looks like he's in the news four days ago

21:59.200 --> 22:02.320
on how the current comedy landscape, quote, sucks.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.360
Second quote, grow a set and get over it.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.240
So I think he's probably doing all right.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.040
He's doing it.

22:10.400 --> 22:17.280
The very first line on his web page is Larry the Cable Guy is back to get her done.

22:17.840 --> 22:22.160
So apparently he stopped doing that one for a while and he's like, dip back in.

22:22.160 --> 22:22.880
I can't wait.

22:22.880 --> 22:26.560
Do you think that they'll put on his tombstone like, got her done?

22:27.200 --> 22:27.840
He'll never die.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.240
My seven-year-old son lost a tooth at the beginning of quarantine

22:32.240 --> 22:35.200
and the tooth fairy had his $7 ready to go and waiting.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.520
He gets his age in dollars per tooth.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.080
Nice.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.800
And when he loses a tooth at 35, cash.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.240
A week into quarantine, he lost another tooth.

22:44.240 --> 22:44.960
I had no cash.

22:44.960 --> 22:45.840
I wanted to stay at home.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.560
I reused the same $7 for tooth number two.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.920
Now he has another seriously loose tooth.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.680
I feel like if I use the same $7 for a third time,

22:55.680 --> 22:59.440
he may notice that the piggy bank, which is partially transparent

22:59.440 --> 23:05.600
and open top cup that used to house cotton candy is not getting any fuller.

23:05.600 --> 23:10.240
Do I tell him the tooth fairy is social distancing and grant him an IOU from the fairy?

23:10.240 --> 23:13.280
Just tell him the truth and tell him I owe him $14 at a later date.

23:13.280 --> 23:13.760
No.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.640
Is there a third option that's from Tooth Fairy Troubles in Tennessee?

23:16.640 --> 23:17.200
Hey, Toby.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.720
Toby, you got Venmo.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.440
Little Toby.

23:20.400 --> 23:20.960
It's me.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.720
Hey, it's me the tooth fairy.

23:22.720 --> 23:23.680
You got Venmo.

23:23.680 --> 23:32.400
Could you set up a barter system where the tooth fairy leaves a note that says,

23:32.400 --> 23:36.160
hey, banks are closed, wasn't able to get $7,

23:36.720 --> 23:42.640
but here is an unopened Blu-ray copy of the hot girl.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.880
The retail value of which is, I assure you.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.560
I thought you were going deeper.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.680
I thought we were doing like $7 in like beads and shells.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.920
I was taking it all the way back.

23:55.920 --> 23:58.240
I got some shiny rocks from the garden.

23:59.040 --> 24:02.160
There's also a version of this where you say, oh, sure.

24:02.160 --> 24:09.680
I could give you $7 or I could give you $20 of what I'm calling mommy script.

24:09.680 --> 24:13.840
And this is, you can exchange this for all kinds of things on the company store.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.600
We got a mug.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.280
We got pencil.

24:17.280 --> 24:24.880
Could you talk the son into the idea that if he can just keep it in his head

24:25.600 --> 24:27.920
for a few more months, he'll hit eight.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.600
And that's an investment in his future.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.840
It's basically giving away money to let the tooth come out right now.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.360
Put some super glue in there.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.320
Keep that bad boy cooking for a little bit while longer.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.400
You can convince them to wager $7 in a rigged carnival game of your creation.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.600
Nice.

24:47.600 --> 24:51.920
You're saying, the tooth fairy says you can have everybody now.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.360
You can keep the juice going for a little bit.

24:55.360 --> 24:59.840
Try and knock over this bowling pin with this baseball.

24:59.840 --> 25:00.880
Oh, you didn't do it.

25:00.880 --> 25:01.200
Shit.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.400
Well, maybe next tooth.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.360
Now, do you have a friend?

25:05.360 --> 25:06.960
This is me talking to the son.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.800
Do you have a friend with a loose tooth?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.880
Because if you can get that loose tooth,

25:10.880 --> 25:13.840
now that's when you're making the real money, right?

25:13.840 --> 25:17.680
And then if you can get that friend to collect someone else's loose tooth,

25:17.680 --> 25:18.560
now we're talking.

25:18.560 --> 25:23.120
I'm doing like a multi-level tooth fairy marketing kind of thing.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.000
Is that anything?

25:25.120 --> 25:28.080
I think tooth transaction in these challenging times

25:28.080 --> 25:30.960
is pretty high up on the list of things not to do.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.400
I think I've seen that around.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.360
Okay, what about this?

25:33.360 --> 25:34.880
The kid's seven, right?

25:34.880 --> 25:37.200
Just leave a credit card under their pillow.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.040
They're not going to be able to do anything with it,

25:39.040 --> 25:42.560
but they're going to feel like they just got a lot of money, right?

25:42.560 --> 25:43.360
That's true.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.680
Yeah, it could be even like one of those fake credit cards

25:45.680 --> 25:48.560
that they put in letters to like trick you into opening it.

25:50.240 --> 25:50.880
They don't know.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.600
How dumb are fucking, how fucking dumb are people?

25:54.560 --> 25:55.440
Hey, everybody.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.040
Hey, don't throw that away.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.560
There's a card in there.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.080
That looks like the one I used to buy with using money on it.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.600
That's, you're throwing away money.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.400
It's a card.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.520
Now, the tooth fairy left a note here, son,

26:07.520 --> 26:10.720
and it says that the tooth fairy didn't have $7 to give you,

26:10.720 --> 26:14.960
but the tooth fairy has opened up a line of credit in your name.

26:14.960 --> 26:19.200
And when you hit 18 and your credit age is over 11 years,

26:19.200 --> 26:21.840
you are going to be so grateful.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.480
That's good.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.240
You could also be like, yeah, oh, wow,

26:24.240 --> 26:26.080
the tooth fairy left a little note here saying

26:26.560 --> 26:28.640
that they named a star after you.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.800
It's that one.

26:32.800 --> 26:33.920
It's that one up there.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.360
Says this tooth was no good, didn't count.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.760
This tooth just didn't count.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.080
Oh gosh, it says here your room was too dirty.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.400
They couldn't find a path to your pillow.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.200
Yeah, weird.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.560
Man, eventually they're going to give them

26:48.560 --> 26:51.360
back the $7 they stole for tooth one, yes?

26:51.920 --> 26:52.160
Yes.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.520
Yeah, you have to imagine.

26:53.520 --> 26:57.920
I think the way to go is the tooth fairy is social distancing.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.840
They told me that they will return when everything is,

27:01.840 --> 27:04.560
like you can't go to the store right now anyways, right?

27:05.760 --> 27:07.680
Maybe don't take that attitude.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.640
Not that I'm saying, hey, what do you need this money for?

27:10.640 --> 27:11.760
I think that's great, Trav.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.400
It's a good thing right now to tell your seven-year-old kid

27:14.400 --> 27:16.960
that things are so scary and terrible that magic is dead.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.200
I think that that's, yeah, absolutely.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.320
No, magic is not dead.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.640
Magic is being safe, Justin, as we all should be.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.200
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.120
Because the opposite side of that is you say,

27:27.120 --> 27:29.280
well, the tooth fairy came and gave you $7,

27:29.280 --> 27:31.920
but because the tooth fairy wasn't practicing

27:31.920 --> 27:34.480
good social distancing, they got sick.

27:36.240 --> 27:36.960
We don't know.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.440
You could also just say, hey, all dentists are closed.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.280
The tooth fairy is busy.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.280
There's just one of them.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.880
They don't have Santa magic.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.400
So like it takes them a bit.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.840
Maybe this is a good opportunity

27:49.840 --> 27:52.000
when your son does notice the money is missing

27:52.000 --> 27:52.720
because they will.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.680
Maybe it's a good opportunity to talk to ask him

27:55.680 --> 27:57.440
about this fucking shitty Fort Knox

27:57.440 --> 27:59.440
that he's constructed to keep his cash safe.

27:59.440 --> 28:00.560
Are you kidding me?

28:00.560 --> 28:02.880
A cut up cotton candy container?

28:02.880 --> 28:03.680
You're seven.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.920
That's job, he's seven.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.080
But like if you're gonna give someone money,

28:08.080 --> 28:10.240
they should at least have something better to put it in

28:10.240 --> 28:12.160
than like just like an old hole.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.560
Oh, this is like a see-through container.

28:14.560 --> 28:14.960
Oh, don't misunderstand.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.720
He's begging to be robbed.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.920
Justin, I was saying that six is an appropriate age

28:19.920 --> 28:21.600
for like an old cotton candy.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.600
Seven in wall safe.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.960
What do you do with it?

28:24.960 --> 28:27.760
It's possible that this is one of a series of dead drops

28:27.760 --> 28:30.880
that they have all throughout the neighborhood.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.640
That's where you keep the daily cash,

28:32.640 --> 28:36.560
but you deposit it every night in a safe location.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.720
So you keep some cash on hand

28:38.720 --> 28:42.160
in case you need to do any like day-to-day transactions.

28:42.160 --> 28:46.400
But the real nest egg, well, you'll never find that, mother.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.880
My kids have a perfect system.

28:48.880 --> 28:52.320
They store all their change in a giant pink crayon

28:52.960 --> 28:55.760
that is the loudest, heaviest, worst thing on earth.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.800
And it's a perfect way to keep it safe for me

28:58.800 --> 29:01.200
because if I look at the crayon, I get so angry,

29:01.200 --> 29:03.120
I wanna put my head through a plate glass window.

29:03.120 --> 29:03.440
Yeah.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.880
So it's a perfect system.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.240
That BB has a similar, she has a big soda bottle.

29:09.760 --> 29:13.680
And the idea of ever trying to fish out anything from it.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.760
Yeah, perfect savings.

29:15.760 --> 29:16.880
Yes, it's perfect.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.440
Speaking of saving our pennies

29:21.440 --> 29:23.520
and scraping together what meager earnings we can,

29:24.160 --> 29:26.640
let's take a brief break and head on over to the Money Zone.

29:26.640 --> 29:39.680
Hey, you gotta do stamps and you gotta do mail.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.520
Mail is still the big one.

29:41.520 --> 29:44.240
And if you wanna avoid the crowds

29:44.240 --> 29:46.080
by skipping the post office,

29:46.080 --> 29:48.800
you can do everything that you do at the post office

29:48.800 --> 29:50.320
at stamps.com.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.120
You can use your computer to print official US postage,

29:53.120 --> 29:55.600
24 seven, any letter, any package, any class of mail,

29:55.600 --> 29:56.960
anywhere you wanna send it.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.000
And then once your mail's ready,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.240
you just slap that bad boy on there

30:00.240 --> 30:02.480
and leave it out for a mail carrier

30:02.480 --> 30:04.560
or you can schedule a free package pickup

30:04.560 --> 30:06.320
or drop it in a mailbox.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.320
No human contact required.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.080
They still want that circulated.

30:44.960 --> 30:45.680
If you weren't,

30:45.680 --> 30:48.480
if you were thinking about doing some naughty stuff out there,

30:48.480 --> 30:51.680
stamps.com begs you to reconsider.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.480
Let me just say this.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.400
Stamps.com if you're listening,

30:54.400 --> 30:55.600
and I bet you are,

30:55.600 --> 30:57.200
stamp safe, my friends.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.000
What do you think about that?

30:58.000 --> 30:58.480
Is that it?

30:58.480 --> 30:59.040
That's good.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.600
Stay stamp safe.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.200
Stay stamp, my friends.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.280
Stay safe, my stamps.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.800
Oops, we didn't mean to put that in the copy of the email.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.800
We were talking to our beautiful stamps again.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.600
Oh, my beautiful stamps.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.280
You stay in the box.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.320
My beautiful stamps.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.640
I know you want to come out of box

31:20.640 --> 31:22.400
and breathe the warm sunshine air,

31:22.400 --> 31:23.840
but you mustn't, my stamps.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.440
Stay safe.

31:25.440 --> 31:26.400
Stay safe, my stamps.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.760
Stay safe in your home.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.200
No one must know about my stamps.

31:32.560 --> 31:36.000
The time has almost come for us to rise to power my stamps,

31:36.000 --> 31:36.720
but not now.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.560
For now, stay safe.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.400
Listen, you've tried round space.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.480
Now try Squarespace.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.840
Round space made shitty websites.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.320
Hi, everybody.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.440
My name is Justin McElroy.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.240
I'm Sydney McElroy.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.680
We're both doctors and-

32:53.680 --> 32:54.480
Nope, just me.

32:54.480 --> 32:55.440
Okay, well, Sydney's a doctor

32:55.440 --> 32:57.520
and I'm a medical enthusiast

32:57.520 --> 32:59.440
and we create Sawbones,

32:59.440 --> 33:01.040
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.600
Every week I dig through the annals of medical history

33:03.600 --> 33:09.040
to bring you the wildest, grossest, sometimes dumbest tales

33:09.040 --> 33:11.120
of ways we've tried to treat people throughout history.

33:11.120 --> 33:14.080
And lately we do a lot of modern fake medicine

33:14.080 --> 33:15.920
because everything's a disaster,

33:15.920 --> 33:18.640
but it's slightly less of a disaster every Friday

33:18.640 --> 33:20.000
right here on MaximumFun.org

33:20.000 --> 33:20.960
as we bring you Sawbones,

33:20.960 --> 33:22.960
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

33:22.960 --> 33:23.600
And remember-

33:23.600 --> 33:25.680
Don't drill a hole in your head.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.720
Y'all want a second, Yahoo?

33:30.720 --> 33:31.440
Absolutely.

33:31.440 --> 33:31.920
Okay.

33:31.920 --> 33:32.720
This is usually,

33:32.720 --> 33:34.400
this is the longest we've gone without a segment,

33:34.400 --> 33:36.160
so I was getting kind of nervous.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.760
This one is sent in by Emma Cant.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.400
Thank you, Emma.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.720
It's Yahoo Answers user Ray who asks,

33:40.720 --> 33:46.400
Why is it every time I binge Godfather 1, 2, 3,

33:46.400 --> 33:50.320
I come out acting more serious like the Godfather himself?

33:50.320 --> 33:51.120
Oh boy.

33:51.840 --> 33:52.880
Tell me about it.

33:54.240 --> 33:58.480
That's how I feel anytime I watch any movie, you know?

33:58.480 --> 34:00.240
You've, no, I don't know, Travis.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.760
I come out like the Godfather.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.360
Oh, okay.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.720
Any movie, huh?

34:04.720 --> 34:05.840
Any movie.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.280
I watched Follow That Bird,

34:08.400 --> 34:09.840
the Sesame Street movie.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.800
The Sesame Street movie?

34:10.800 --> 34:12.720
Came out like, oh, forget about it.

34:15.040 --> 34:15.680
That was cool.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.440
I watched Dolittle.

34:17.440 --> 34:21.680
I came out like, oh, the day of my daughter's wedding.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.480
Forget about it.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.240
That's cool.

34:24.240 --> 34:26.240
We're doing good impressions of Godfather.

34:26.960 --> 34:27.200
Yeah.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.920
Justin, do you know the one about the offer?

34:32.000 --> 34:32.240
Okay.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.360
That's not bad.

34:38.000 --> 34:38.720
Okay, now Griffin-

34:38.720 --> 34:41.040
Whoa, guys, I didn't know I had one.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.240
I opened my mouth.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.920
I opened my mouth unsure of what would emerge.

34:45.920 --> 34:46.800
It's very good.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.280
I'll never have that back again.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.880
There's just a little bit of one.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.760
It's not much of one,

34:51.760 --> 34:52.960
but there was a little bit of something in there.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.640
I think it was because we weren't expecting it,

34:54.640 --> 34:56.640
that it sounded like a lot of one.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.320
Everybody save your files real quick.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.600
Does everybody download and save the files real quick?

35:05.600 --> 35:07.840
I gotta check, Juice, if it's hereditary.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.920
I made him an offer he couldn't rule.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.200
I made him an offer.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.920
I made him an offer.

35:13.920 --> 35:17.680
I made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.880
Yeah, we've all got it.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.920
I wonder if that came from mom or dad,

35:22.560 --> 35:25.840
this gene that we all have.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.200
No, that's Cartman.

35:27.200 --> 35:27.920
That's what I was doing.

35:27.920 --> 35:28.800
Let me try again.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.760
Let me take a drink of water.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.160
Hold on.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.040
Trying to refuse this offer, you can't.

35:33.040 --> 35:33.840
It's too good.

35:33.840 --> 35:37.920
I offered him something and he liked it.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.160
He said, yeah, that's a good offer.

35:40.720 --> 35:44.160
I included this question mostly because of the picture it paints

35:44.160 --> 35:47.440
of the type of person this is who sees Godfather 1, 2, and 3,

35:47.440 --> 35:48.880
and then has to comment on,

35:48.880 --> 35:51.440
oh boy, I really feel more like the Godfather.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.240
What a badass.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.720
No, it does say serious, not like a badass.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.240
You walk out and you're like,

35:58.240 --> 36:00.240
I guess I should take care of my bills.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.840
That's what the Godfather would do.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.000
I feel more responsible.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.120
You walk out of the theater like,

36:05.120 --> 36:07.200
oh man, my shoes are really dirty.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.640
How long have my shoes been dirty?

36:08.640 --> 36:10.320
I'm going to clean those post-haste.

36:10.880 --> 36:17.760
Are you all susceptible to movie personality shifts?

36:17.760 --> 36:22.000
Because I am remembering distinctly when I went

36:22.000 --> 36:26.640
and I did see Drive and then I got out of Drive

36:26.640 --> 36:30.720
and I got out on the highway and the needle hit that speed limit

36:30.720 --> 36:35.280
and then I was like, but then I was like, Drive?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.760
And I went just a little bit over

36:37.760 --> 36:40.800
and I felt guilty about it for like six weeks.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.560
That's, I remember when I went

36:42.560 --> 36:45.200
and I saw Dirty Dancing Havana Nights.

36:45.200 --> 36:45.760
Here it goes.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.160
And I was like, up till then, you know,

36:48.160 --> 36:52.560
my very religious parents had always tried to keep me dancing

36:52.560 --> 36:54.800
pretty clean, you know, with Room for the Holy Ghost

36:54.800 --> 36:56.080
and Katie by the Door.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.320
And in the daytime in Havana.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.520
And in the daytime too.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.080
They said, you can dance in Havana,

37:02.080 --> 37:04.960
but only during the daytime and with Room for the Holy Ghost.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.920
And I said, no, no, no, no one puts Travis in a corner

37:07.920 --> 37:11.680
and tonight I'm going to dirty dance at night in Havana.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.400
And they said, okay, well, I guess that's fine.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.600
You're 36.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.840
So I just, oh, by the way, I just saw it like last week.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.800
Yeah.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.680
You just watched of your own volition the film

37:24.800 --> 37:26.640
Dirty Dancing Havana Nights.

37:26.640 --> 37:30.160
Well, I was the only person to watch it

37:30.160 --> 37:31.680
probably for the last four years.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.000
Well, I just seen Dirty Dancing for the first time

37:34.000 --> 37:35.840
and I said, I have to see what happens next.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.880
The saga continues.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.800
What happens to these characters that I love so much.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.000
Oh, they go to Havana.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.440
That sounds intriguing.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.760
You all may have read in the newspapers

37:45.760 --> 37:48.320
about how Travis did get arrested in Havana

37:48.320 --> 37:50.960
for going to a nightclub and dancing

37:50.960 --> 37:53.360
while spreading his butt cheeks wide, wide open

37:53.360 --> 37:55.040
and people kept yelling too dirty.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.080
And they also kept saying six feet, six feet.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.840
And I thought they meant how wide

37:59.840 --> 38:01.280
I needed to spread my butt cheeks.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.560
He got, Travis got hurt.

38:02.560 --> 38:03.360
Travis got hurt.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.800
Travis got hurt real bad.

38:04.800 --> 38:09.280
Got hurt real bad.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.600
I was laid up in a Havana hospital for a while

38:11.600 --> 38:13.840
while they sewed my body back together.

38:15.840 --> 38:18.160
I done ripped myself in half starting the butt cheeks

38:18.160 --> 38:19.680
which to be fair, I've said before

38:20.400 --> 38:21.760
would be the place to do it

38:21.760 --> 38:23.440
because that's the natural perforation.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.440
Yeah, but sure.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.160
But now he can fly like a Dumbo boy down there.

38:28.160 --> 38:29.600
That is true.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.080
That is true.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.080
Did you guys hear about vampire pizza?

38:40.080 --> 38:40.320
No.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.760
I just want to say thank you.

38:43.760 --> 38:44.560
This is good.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.280
This is not a much squad because it's too good.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.520
I just kind of wanted to kind of put it out in the world.

38:49.520 --> 38:53.840
Thank you to Mel and Eric for reporting on this.

38:53.840 --> 38:54.880
This is an LA thing

38:55.520 --> 38:58.960
and basically vampire pizza is this pizza restaurant

38:58.960 --> 39:02.000
that's run by vampires and you order a pizza

39:02.000 --> 39:04.320
and when they bring you the pizza and maybe a salad

39:04.880 --> 39:09.280
they also bring an immersive alternate reality game

39:09.280 --> 39:12.000
about a vampire family owning a pizza restaurant

39:12.000 --> 39:13.680
that you have to involve yourself in and solve.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.000
Does that make you mad?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.360
I would love to do that.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.680
I would love to get into vampire pizza.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.360
I just want to let you guys know

39:21.360 --> 39:22.880
that vampire pizza was happening out there.

39:22.880 --> 39:27.120
There's still artists, both pizza and more traditional media

39:27.120 --> 39:29.840
working out there to bring joy

39:29.840 --> 39:34.160
and I want to thank the vampire pizza for existing

39:34.160 --> 39:39.200
and thank you to Mel and Eric for the report.

39:39.200 --> 39:39.920
With that out of the way.

39:39.920 --> 39:53.840
I want to munch, I want to munch, I want to munch,

39:53.840 --> 39:59.040
I want to munch, I want to munch, I want to munch.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.480
Welcome to Munch Squad Retro.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.680
I could almost pinpoint the inspiration for that

40:03.680 --> 40:04.800
and I couldn't.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.960
It's a pastiche, it's a pastiche.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.160
She's so mad.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.360
It's a pastiche, pastiche.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.400
With brand innovation at an all time low,

40:16.960 --> 40:21.520
I asked you folks to find your finest munch squads

40:22.080 --> 40:24.560
from the olden days, press releases

40:24.560 --> 40:27.520
from back the before times, way, way back.

40:28.080 --> 40:32.480
Last time we took you to the amazing world of 1993

40:33.440 --> 40:36.240
and this, by the way, you could send this to Justin

40:36.240 --> 40:40.320
at mbnbam.com, just put like throwback munch squad

40:40.320 --> 40:42.240
in the subject, but bring the heat

40:42.240 --> 40:43.920
or you will be mercilessly mocked.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.040
So thank you to Nate who did in fact bring the heat

40:47.840 --> 40:49.920
with this fine story.

40:49.920 --> 40:54.000
Heinz easy squirt adds a little quote mystery

40:54.000 --> 40:55.280
to its colored condiment.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.840
Oh, you won't know until you squirt.

40:57.840 --> 41:04.480
Oh, what an unpleasant combination

41:04.480 --> 41:06.160
of thoughts and words.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.280
It's just so fucking.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.720
Okay, so 90s kids are gonna love this one

41:10.720 --> 41:12.720
because they remember, but for a while Heinz

41:12.720 --> 41:15.440
was making ketchup in a lot of buckwild colors

41:16.080 --> 41:18.080
and it still tasted like ketchup,

41:18.080 --> 41:19.920
but it's all the colors were wild

41:19.920 --> 41:22.080
and this was an evolution of that

41:22.080 --> 41:25.360
in February of 2002.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.000
So let's see.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.360
Oh, Travis was looking forward

41:29.360 --> 41:31.520
to graduating high school, he was.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.480
Yeah, we're five months out from 9-11

41:34.480 --> 41:36.480
and finally the nation is ready to heal

41:37.120 --> 41:39.120
with Heinz easy squirt.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.560
Heinz has a great condiment caper on their hands.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.120
Oh boy.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.120
Can color condiment crazed kids

41:45.120 --> 41:46.880
help solve the mystery?

41:46.880 --> 41:49.680
Heinz revealed today its new product for kids,

41:49.680 --> 41:52.080
Heinz easy squirt mystery color.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.240
Three new colors of the condiment

41:54.240 --> 41:57.520
will hit grocery shelves nationwide in late April,

41:57.520 --> 41:59.760
but children and parents won't have a clue

41:59.760 --> 42:02.160
what's inside the easy squirt bottles

42:02.160 --> 42:04.800
until they squirt or draw with it

42:04.800 --> 42:06.480
on their favorite foods.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.480
The new colors are passion pink,

42:08.480 --> 42:11.840
awesome orange and totally teal.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.680
Okay, fine.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.160
You don't understand children

42:16.160 --> 42:18.560
if you think there's any chance

42:18.560 --> 42:20.320
they wanna be surprised by what color

42:20.320 --> 42:21.360
is now on their hot dog.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.400
It's all the same flavor?

42:24.960 --> 42:26.400
It's all the same flavor.

42:26.400 --> 42:29.680
Quote, here's a quote from Brian Hansberry.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.240
Heinz is introducing three new colors

42:32.240 --> 42:33.760
that kids can mix and match

42:33.760 --> 42:36.160
to triple their fun at family meals.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.480
So just so I'm clear,

42:38.480 --> 42:41.600
I'm now keeping three bottles of ketchup

42:41.600 --> 42:43.280
that I've had to hand label

42:43.280 --> 42:45.680
because it's a mystery what color these are

42:45.680 --> 42:48.320
so my kids can make ketchup art.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.080
This is, okay.

42:50.720 --> 42:54.480
Thanks to its cool curves and thin nozzle,

42:54.480 --> 42:57.520
easy squirt gives kids the opportunity

42:57.520 --> 42:59.360
to be artists at the table,

42:59.360 --> 43:00.800
expressing their creativity

43:00.800 --> 43:02.720
by drawing with bright colors.

43:03.280 --> 43:06.320
Brian, you haven't met my terrible children.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.360
What have you done?

43:09.600 --> 43:11.360
Families that buy two or more bottles

43:11.360 --> 43:12.880
may find they have different colors,

43:13.680 --> 43:15.520
allowing pint-sized Picassos

43:15.520 --> 43:17.920
to blend one mystery color with another.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.400
They're all ketchup, Stell, they're all ketchup.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.240
They'll also enjoy the same benefits

43:22.240 --> 43:24.560
consumers have come to expect

43:24.560 --> 43:26.720
from the popular kid condiment.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.040
You mean ketchup flavor, I guess.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.480
Yeah, Justin, red ketchup flavor.

43:32.480 --> 43:35.040
Wait a minute, it's different now.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.120
This is good.

43:39.120 --> 43:40.560
Heinz easy squirt mystery color

43:40.560 --> 43:42.880
boasts a special nozzle for accuracy

43:42.880 --> 43:44.880
and an ergonomic shape designed

43:44.880 --> 43:47.200
so smaller hands can hold on tight,

43:47.200 --> 43:49.760
allowing them to create mealtime masterpieces.

43:49.760 --> 43:50.720
This is the best.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.200
And for little fries who want no surprise,

43:53.200 --> 43:55.280
try regular Heinz tomato ketchup.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.920
You can't handle it, you stick with red.

44:00.960 --> 44:04.800
Your dumbass kids can't chill with this amazing ketchup.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.360
But here's the thing, I'm betting that's most kids.

44:08.320 --> 44:09.920
Yeah, only one million bottles

44:09.920 --> 44:11.920
of Heinz easy squirt mystery color

44:11.920 --> 44:13.360
are being produced.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.720
When they're gone, they're gone.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.040
Super sleuths will need to emerge

44:17.040 --> 44:19.360
from the shadows quickly to nap a bottle

44:19.360 --> 44:21.440
before the trail grows cold

44:21.440 --> 44:23.760
and easy squirt mystery colors disappear forever.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.960
Also, we should mention, Heinz has murdered someone,

44:26.960 --> 44:29.280
so we're gonna need you to solve that as well.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.080
Thank you.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.840
Mr. and Mrs. Perkins, I gotta tell you,

44:31.840 --> 44:34.400
Johnny's failing all of his classes

44:34.400 --> 44:36.080
and us at school are really worried about him.

44:36.640 --> 44:40.320
Listen, he's really wrapped up in this Heinz mystery.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.480
It's really soaking up all of his free time.

44:43.600 --> 44:44.080
No.

44:44.080 --> 44:49.520
You don't know, it's a worldwide conspiracy at this point.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.920
He's been undercover at the Giant Eagle

44:51.920 --> 44:53.040
for three months now.

44:54.240 --> 44:56.960
Heinz's most recent, it's saying how fast

44:56.960 --> 44:59.040
these are gonna sell, Heinz's most recent

44:59.040 --> 45:03.840
condiment coupes, blastin' green

45:03.840 --> 45:08.160
and funky purple easy squirt food products.

45:08.160 --> 45:08.880
I remember those.

45:09.680 --> 45:12.960
They gripped the imaginations of children.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.840
They, like, mom, listen, I wanna go to school,

45:15.840 --> 45:18.240
I can't stop thinking about this fucking green ketchup.

45:20.240 --> 45:23.040
Hey, just one more time, can I see it one more time?

45:23.040 --> 45:24.080
Just one more time.

45:24.080 --> 45:25.440
I'd love to go outside and play pretend

45:25.440 --> 45:27.360
with Vicky and Brian and all the gang,

45:27.360 --> 45:31.120
but my imagination is gripped by the funky purple easy squirt.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.160
Think about all the things I could do

45:32.160 --> 45:33.600
with this green ketchup.

45:33.600 --> 45:37.360
I could put it on a hot dog, with french fry, anything.

45:38.240 --> 45:41.200
I've spoiled all the dang food in the fridge again.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.240
What with my constant opening to peer

45:44.240 --> 45:45.600
at these beautiful ketchups.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.080
It is, it is bonkers to me,

45:48.080 --> 45:49.600
because I was just sitting here thinking,

45:49.600 --> 45:53.040
oh yeah, there was a time when I couldn't squirt ketchup

45:53.040 --> 45:55.040
out of a bottle, huh?

45:55.040 --> 45:59.520
Yeah, as always, Heinz is looking for feedback

45:59.520 --> 46:01.680
from its number one consumer, kids.

46:02.320 --> 46:07.520
Kids are encouraged to log on to www.easysquirt.com.

46:07.520 --> 46:08.880
Oh no, oh no.

46:08.880 --> 46:12.000
April 1st, and get candid about the new colors.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.800
Now, there's another line here from Justin McElroy,

46:14.800 --> 46:18.480
April 2020, kids are discouraged from logging on

46:18.480 --> 46:22.800
to www.easysquirtatanything.anything.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.480
Anything with the word squirt in it, kids.

46:24.480 --> 46:28.880
www.easysquirt.

46:28.880 --> 46:30.880
This is not what I expected.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.040
It's, we're not gonna, no,

46:33.040 --> 46:34.400
no one should be going to this website.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.160
Here's the thing, Heinz let it go, okay?

46:36.160 --> 46:39.040
I don't know why, but Heinz didn't renew the lease

46:39.040 --> 46:42.320
on that particular URL.

46:42.320 --> 46:44.320
Do you think they're looking,

46:44.320 --> 46:46.720
they're in the market for a new verb

46:46.720 --> 46:50.880
to describe how to get the fluid out of their bodies?

46:50.880 --> 46:52.720
Do you think they've been shopping around some,

46:52.720 --> 46:55.440
yeah, dude, it just sploches right,

46:55.440 --> 46:56.960
no, not that one, dang it.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.800
Which mystery color will write

47:00.800 --> 47:03.040
the next chapter of Easy Squirt history?

47:03.040 --> 47:07.200
Huh, will young food artists create passion pink penguins

47:07.200 --> 47:09.040
waddling across their hamburgers?

47:09.040 --> 47:09.280
What?

47:09.280 --> 47:12.400
Will they sketch awesome orange orangutans

47:12.400 --> 47:14.880
clambering across their french fries

47:14.880 --> 47:19.200
or outline totally teal turtles napping on their hot dogs?

47:19.200 --> 47:22.800
Hey, thanks for the fucking creativity prompts,

47:22.800 --> 47:25.600
press release about colorful ketchup.

47:25.600 --> 47:26.800
My kids really appreciate it.

47:26.800 --> 47:30.640
I'll also say this, granted BB's not even four yet,

47:30.640 --> 47:32.240
but I can't imagine her being like,

47:32.240 --> 47:33.920
I'd love to eat this hot dog, dad,

47:33.920 --> 47:38.320
but first I'm gonna draw an orangutan on it with ketchup.

47:38.320 --> 47:43.120
Yeah, my kid made a cat out of a Diet Dr. Pepper box

47:43.120 --> 47:45.840
and a Cool Whip container named Trash Cat,

47:45.840 --> 47:48.240
and it's been sitting in our mantle for six months.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.600
So I shudder to think, shudder to think

47:51.600 --> 47:54.640
what the fate would be of a hot dog

47:54.640 --> 47:57.680
that received a lot of creative attention.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.120
It's terrifying to consider.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.960
How about another question?

48:00.960 --> 48:03.040
Here's another question, I live in the Midwest

48:03.040 --> 48:06.240
and my state has a very big state fair every year

48:06.240 --> 48:08.320
that I've gone to ever since I was a kid.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.600
I recently found out my state fair

48:09.600 --> 48:11.840
has a husband calling contest,

48:11.840 --> 48:13.920
which is basically a contest where wives compete

48:13.920 --> 48:16.320
to see who can call their husband in for supper the best.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.720
Like if they were on a farm.

48:19.520 --> 48:20.880
I think, yeah, got it.

48:20.880 --> 48:23.120
I think that it'd be fun to participate in this contest,

48:23.120 --> 48:24.720
but unfortunately I don't have a husband.

48:25.280 --> 48:28.480
I really wanna yell at my fake husband for prize money.

48:28.480 --> 48:31.040
Is it ethical for me to enter this contest?

48:31.040 --> 48:32.640
And if so, how would I do it?

48:33.440 --> 48:36.000
Ethical is a funny word to use there.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.440
Is it ethical?

48:37.440 --> 48:38.800
Sure, it's a, yeah.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.080
You're not lying about a law degree.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.160
Let's talk about this contest.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.400
This is from Husbandless Hopeful in Iowa.

48:48.720 --> 48:56.080
If it's just wives allowed to call their farm husbands

48:56.080 --> 49:00.560
to supper, I think that it would be good

49:00.560 --> 49:03.040
to do unethical to the contest.

49:03.760 --> 49:04.880
I think, you know what I mean?

49:04.880 --> 49:05.520
If it's-

49:05.520 --> 49:09.920
I would argue that if you enter the contest

49:09.920 --> 49:13.120
without a husband and yelled so good

49:13.840 --> 49:16.080
that your future husband showed up,

49:16.640 --> 49:18.080
you automatically win.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.360
Like you yell and someone walks up and is like,

49:21.360 --> 49:24.960
I heard the call and I had to come.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.200
Hi, I'm Jerry, right?

49:27.200 --> 49:31.600
And it's like, wow, that's a win, right?

49:31.600 --> 49:33.600
I have just some samplings.

49:33.600 --> 49:39.040
I've found an Iowa PBS report about a similar contest.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.640
Perhaps it is this one, who knows?

49:41.280 --> 49:43.440
And I just wanted to, if you guys wanna get an idea

49:43.440 --> 49:44.720
of sort of what we're talking about,

49:45.840 --> 49:47.440
I'll play that clip for you now.

49:47.440 --> 49:48.240
Please be silent.

49:48.240 --> 49:55.040
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, hurry up.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.320
I don't wanna be late.

49:57.280 --> 50:01.120
I don't wanna be late to the great Iowa State Fair.

50:01.120 --> 50:02.640
Bob, hurry, hurry.

50:03.440 --> 50:05.360
Bob, Robert Dean.

50:07.040 --> 50:07.680
That's cool.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.960
That was not at all what I was expecting.

50:10.960 --> 50:13.520
No, so do you have to yell Bob?

50:14.160 --> 50:15.680
Everybody yells Bob.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.040
Everybody's married to-

50:17.040 --> 50:18.320
It sounds like Robert Dean.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.200
It just seems to me like you could win

50:21.200 --> 50:23.040
by just being like, hey, and then be like,

50:23.040 --> 50:23.760
oh, be right there.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.760
And you're like, that's how good I yell.

50:25.760 --> 50:26.720
That's how good I yell.

50:26.720 --> 50:27.840
I don't have to do-

50:27.840 --> 50:30.880
Or you just get like supper or just text them.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.840
Walk up onto the stage and hold onto your temples

50:33.840 --> 50:37.440
and close your eyes and then have a paid professional walk

50:37.440 --> 50:38.960
onto the stage like, did you call me?

50:38.960 --> 50:40.480
And you'd be like, money, please.

50:40.480 --> 50:42.560
Prize money now, give it to me, I've won.

50:43.520 --> 50:45.920
Checking back in, here's our fourth place winner.

50:45.920 --> 50:52.640
Yoo-hoo, Yoo-hoo, Keith, Keith, Yoo-hoo.

50:52.640 --> 50:53.200
That's strong.

50:53.200 --> 51:00.880
Cuckoo, cuckoo, the clock says dinner time.

51:00.880 --> 51:01.440
That was strong.

51:01.440 --> 51:02.160
That's powerful.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.880
That's a powerful call.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.680
Is the husband's name in that scenario, King?

51:08.560 --> 51:09.840
I think it was Keith.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.080
Keith, okay, it did sound like she was just yelling,

51:12.080 --> 51:15.840
King, King, the clock says dinner.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.160
Do you think she decided to do a cuckoo thing

51:20.160 --> 51:21.440
like halfway through?

51:21.440 --> 51:22.800
Like, I'm gonna dip into this.

51:23.440 --> 51:25.680
She just, the motivation hit and she was like,

51:25.680 --> 51:28.720
you know what, this wasn't the direction I was gonna go,

51:28.720 --> 51:31.520
but, and you know what, here's the sad thing.

51:31.520 --> 51:32.800
She probably could have gotten third

51:32.800 --> 51:34.640
if she had just stuck with her.

51:34.640 --> 51:37.360
I think the judges probably saw that flip-flop in the middle

51:37.360 --> 51:40.240
and they're like, nope, no husband's coming to that.

51:40.240 --> 51:42.240
No husband will arrive for that.

51:42.240 --> 51:44.400
Here's our first place winner.

51:44.400 --> 51:46.400
This is the last one I'm gonna dip on, you guys.

51:46.400 --> 51:46.960
Here we go.

51:46.960 --> 51:52.800
Roy, Roy, can you hear me?

51:53.520 --> 51:55.520
You get yourself in here right now.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.040
Come on.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.640
You know you're gonna be late again

52:00.640 --> 52:03.520
and you know that I want to get there on time.

52:03.520 --> 52:09.520
Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy.

52:09.520 --> 52:20.960
I can't, I can't.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.460
No.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.440
Fuck yes.

52:25.600 --> 52:26.880
Don't even enter.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.280
If that's the heat you have to go up against,

52:29.280 --> 52:32.320
unless you're going to come correct, do not enter.

52:32.320 --> 52:37.040
Is that really the thing that any human being ever

52:37.040 --> 52:39.920
is doing on a regular basis to call to another

52:39.920 --> 52:41.600
living human being ever?

52:41.600 --> 52:42.880
Travis, farms are big.

52:42.880 --> 52:43.680
Farms are so big.

52:43.680 --> 52:44.720
Farms are big, Travis.

52:44.720 --> 52:46.800
I know, but I'm saying.

52:46.800 --> 52:51.040
I like the soft Roys that definitely won't get Roy inside.

52:51.040 --> 52:53.040
It began with some quiet Roys that you knew

52:53.040 --> 52:54.480
weren't gonna work, Bonnie.

52:54.480 --> 52:58.880
So I feel like it's a little bit of a honeypot situation.

52:58.880 --> 53:01.600
So I didn't appreciate that, but overall great calling.

53:01.600 --> 53:06.960
I like the subtle Roy because a subtle Roy is good

53:06.960 --> 53:09.680
if it turns out you just didn't see him in the periphery

53:09.680 --> 53:12.160
and Roy is like three feet to your left, right?

53:12.160 --> 53:13.200
And you're like, Roy?

53:13.200 --> 53:14.640
And Roy's like, I'm right here.

53:14.640 --> 53:15.840
And you're like, oh, thank God.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.600
Because if you started off with a powerful Roy

53:20.240 --> 53:22.640
and then you have subtle Roy standing next to you

53:22.640 --> 53:24.000
and he's like, that was too powerful.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.520
You could have been subtle, I'm right here.

53:26.320 --> 53:27.280
Right, okay, that's fair.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.760
Do you think there's people listening to this podcast

53:29.760 --> 53:34.240
who just got ASMR for the first time

53:34.240 --> 53:38.800
and they're like, ah, damn it, I want that now.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.080
And it's so scarce.

53:40.080 --> 53:41.440
It's such a scarce resource.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.760
There's not enough husband calling to go around.

53:45.760 --> 53:47.760
Thank you all so much for listening to our program.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.360
We hope you've enjoyed yourself

53:49.360 --> 53:52.640
and I hope you're hanging in there pretty much

53:53.520 --> 53:57.840
as we while away the days and work together as a planet

53:57.840 --> 54:00.240
to try to battle back the unpleasantness.

54:00.240 --> 54:07.600
We are still doing this podcast and a lot of others.

54:08.800 --> 54:10.320
Now would be a perfect time to dip

54:10.320 --> 54:12.000
into the McElroy back catalog.

54:18.560 --> 54:19.920

54:22.320 --> 54:24.800

54:24.800 --> 54:28.240

54:38.480 --> 54:40.320
does a medical history podcast called Sawbones.

54:41.200 --> 54:43.280
There's a fucking show about cereal on there

54:43.280 --> 54:44.000
called The Empty Bowl.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.440

54:47.440 --> 54:49.520
and we would hope that you'll do that.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.360
But if all of that sounds like garbage,

54:51.360 --> 54:54.560
go to the McElroy family YouTube account

54:54.560 --> 54:56.000
and maybe dig around there.

54:56.000 --> 54:56.480
