WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.260 --> 00:50.260
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:09.740 --> 01:16.380
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin

01:16.380 --> 01:24.180
McElroy, I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy, and I'm the sweet baby brother Griffin Andrew McElroy

01:24.180 --> 01:28.100
Let me just get ahead of it. Let me get ahead of it. I watched the first episode

01:29.380 --> 01:31.380
First episode

01:32.300 --> 01:39.540
It was harrowing is the word I would use I was made certain assurances that we would not need to talk about man

01:39.540 --> 01:39.860
No

01:39.860 --> 01:47.640
But I also don't want people now what I've run into because of the blast on which I was put that yeah in

01:48.260 --> 01:50.260
in my life

01:50.500 --> 01:56.700
Social media in streaming and everything I've done if I mentioned in your bedroom in my bedroom

01:56.900 --> 02:01.900
My wife my children my dog your professional when I'm talking to my priest

02:02.220 --> 02:07.760
My spiritual guidance my yogi when I'm talking to my yogi bear when I'm talking to them

02:07.760 --> 02:12.140
You gotta watch the movie boo-boo and I say I've done I did this today

02:12.140 --> 02:18.220
They're like you should have been watching Man vs. B. And I'm like, okay, I did it now. I did it now never again

02:18.220 --> 02:20.220
So here's the issue Travis you're getting

02:20.860 --> 02:22.860
Man vs. B 1.1

02:24.820 --> 02:31.100
There were a lot of complaints registered toward Netflix with some of the gratuitous

02:31.620 --> 02:33.700
male and B nudity

02:33.700 --> 02:38.960
Yeah in the original cut and so as they are want to do

02:39.180 --> 02:45.260
What with this streaming era and the death of art they went in and just took all that stuff out

02:45.260 --> 02:47.420
So, you know how the episodes are like 20 minutes long

02:47.620 --> 02:48.140
Yeah

02:48.140 --> 02:53.900
They used to be like 35 40 and you were getting a good 15 to 20 minutes of man and be nudity

02:53.900 --> 02:57.580
well, I actually anticipated that because I know of

02:57.580 --> 03:04.020
Netflix's rampant censorship and you know, I actually watched it in 90-second chunks on daily motion

03:06.740 --> 03:13.540
Yeah, I found a playlist and I just watched it that way now there were a couple chunks missing which frankly made it incoherent

03:13.860 --> 03:18.860
But other than that, obviously I dipped into daily motion for those clips for my own

03:19.540 --> 03:26.180
Purposes. Yeah, and my net nanny was like, yeah, well you can we'll let this one go

03:26.180 --> 03:30.260
They're like, it's they were like, it's mr. Bean like there's no erotic

03:31.380 --> 03:33.780
Value it auto blurt out the bees

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
Huge ding along. Yeah

03:37.380 --> 03:42.500
Which is understandable, but they were like, it's mr. Bean's dick and his balls in butthole

03:42.500 --> 03:46.140
It's educational and it's edge. It serves an educational

03:46.140 --> 03:51.580
Yes at that now see that's what I actually noticed Griffin that my net nanny was a little too lenient as well

03:51.580 --> 03:56.180
Which is why I hired a real-life nanny to stand over my shoulder while I looked at stuff

03:56.860 --> 04:03.500
Specifically man versus being I got a Mary Poppins ask like no. No, no, mr. Bean's dick today master Travis

04:06.220 --> 04:09.460
Watching it too much apparently and it was affecting my relationship with my kids

04:09.860 --> 04:15.420
Yeah, she said you must go outside and get some vitamin D and I said I get all the vitamin D

04:15.420 --> 04:17.420
I

04:20.380 --> 04:23.340
Just want them to release the Snyder cut of man versus I

04:24.660 --> 04:26.100
mean

04:26.100 --> 04:33.380
Greg Snyder who was the on-set intimacy consultant for being the man in the be any time that there was

04:34.300 --> 04:42.140
Exposure happening like the scene where the bee climbs inside of his his mr. Bean's penis. Yeah

04:42.140 --> 04:46.040
Um, I want to see he worked hard on that like, yeah

04:47.180 --> 04:50.540
both of them through that and it was probably pretty painful and

04:51.460 --> 04:56.260
Humiliating and it's wild to me that they made such a progressive step to hire an intimacy coordinator

04:56.260 --> 05:03.060
Which everyone should do but then also the rest of it exists. And so that was that was difficult to me

05:03.060 --> 05:05.060
I watched the Snyder cut of

05:05.060 --> 05:10.780
Of Justice League, okay. My big thing there was fucking funny

05:10.780 --> 05:16.660
Yeah, raise your asses everyone. There is just so many scenes of people eating chips that it got

05:18.340 --> 05:22.660
Snyder's is a chip brand which I think might only manufacture chips in

05:25.340 --> 05:27.600
They use peanut oil nice

05:29.980 --> 05:31.980
Enough said

05:32.060 --> 05:34.060
Said they're

05:34.060 --> 05:36.700
Appreciate that. Um, this is an advice show

05:37.660 --> 05:39.660
obviously where we

05:39.780 --> 05:43.460
Take your questions and turn them alchemy like into wisdom. I feel like it's been a

05:44.700 --> 05:50.820
150 years since we've recorded one of these. Well, we should also note that Griffin Griffin decided to move

05:51.460 --> 05:53.460
Yeah

05:53.660 --> 05:59.980
Like yesterday just real hair up my ass sort of stuff where I was like, I'm gonna uproot my entire family and

05:59.980 --> 06:05.420
relocate to the to the beast. Well, most of your family you're having them

06:05.980 --> 06:11.180
Compete to see right he left behind it to make a new life in Austin

06:11.180 --> 06:13.900
You don't want to see it all that territory is you know

06:13.900 --> 06:19.260
So you you want to leave a man in Kamchatka as it were it is kind of our southern

06:19.660 --> 06:26.520
HQ Griffin, which I am I I feel like I covered the Midwest HQ for a while. Yeah

06:26.520 --> 06:34.440
um and and now I feel like you're kind of encroaching a bit on my territory, which I'm not wild about I

06:36.640 --> 06:39.680
Appreciate that we can finally make it permanent our

06:40.600 --> 06:46.700
Absolute denial of other time zones. Yes. Yeah, if you don't know about this this little fact of ours

06:46.960 --> 06:50.800
We have people on on our our team all throughout the country

06:50.800 --> 06:58.560
And if any of them mention any time zones other than Eastern Standard Time, we refuse to acknowledge like we can't process it

06:58.560 --> 06:58.960
Yeah

06:58.960 --> 07:05.280
I asked me again in the in a real time zone because if you talk about another one and we've been doing this with Griffin

07:05.520 --> 07:10.400
Yeah, Griffin has had to pretend that he does not live outside the Eastern Time Zone

07:11.000 --> 07:16.820
Occasionally, I'll be like, oh we can start at 11 and I'm like, it's already 11 already 11. What are you talking about?

07:16.820 --> 07:22.540
Uh, yeah, we're like flat earthers, but for like a very specific sort of latitude range

07:22.780 --> 07:27.900
Yeah, and I'm just saying like daylight savings time who's saving it and give me some back. You know what I mean?

07:27.900 --> 07:33.980
I want some of that some of Travis's whole deal. That's my thing about let's do let's do questions

07:34.340 --> 07:39.980
It's gonna be a while before I do questions again, and I mean we are about to do like three live shows in a row

07:39.980 --> 07:45.020
But that's how you're right. We're about to be doing too many questions, but still my hunger must be sated

07:45.020 --> 07:51.500
Yeah, whenever I go to someone else's house, even my best friends. I hate staying the night. Yeah. Yeah

07:51.620 --> 07:55.380
Yeah, it's not yeah, your stuff's not there. Yeah, your stuff's not there. It's not where your bed is

07:55.380 --> 07:59.780
That's not the air you like. I am not able to sleep always in a cold sweat and wake up feeling gross

07:59.780 --> 08:04.380
I'm happy to be with my friends. So what can I do enjoy waking up within the next morning?

08:04.380 --> 08:06.060
That's from anxiously awake in Alabama

08:06.060 --> 08:11.660
You can't you can go home and then come back before they wake up and then you're like whoa right there

08:11.660 --> 08:14.980
Oh, I was here the whole time to you guys that there's that

08:15.820 --> 08:21.380
sleepover the the sort of like logistics of sleepovers that math changes once you are sort of

08:22.220 --> 08:27.460
Independent and can drive because I would much rather I'll kick it with you until the wee hours

08:27.460 --> 08:32.360
And then when it's time for sleeping in a bed, I have my own that I have been sort of

08:33.060 --> 08:35.060
nestling into

08:35.180 --> 08:38.400
Fucking hard for a long time now

08:38.400 --> 08:45.080
And that is no curious. What about the dangers of driving in the evening? Oh, what time do you go to bed?

08:45.080 --> 08:47.080
Just think cuz I'm heading home at like nine o'clock

08:49.520 --> 08:53.520
Yeah, the wee hours so I was I meant nine to nine thirty

08:54.880 --> 08:58.240
That's when I come home and me and Rachel play we together

09:00.520 --> 09:07.040
We play we play competitive very competitive boom blocks till we work up a nice sweat and then we instantly go to sleep

09:07.040 --> 09:08.080
the

09:08.080 --> 09:13.480
amount of props I need to sleep when I travel is

09:14.720 --> 09:22.280
Truly, I mean it's truly toddler level. It's like we need I need I need the log pillow. I need my wrist

09:23.120 --> 09:26.600
brace for my carpal tunnel syndrome, I need my

09:27.720 --> 09:29.160
special

09:29.160 --> 09:36.480
Eyemask that has the headphones built into it. So I whoa, whoa everyone back off. He's married. No, no, no, no. No, right. I

09:36.960 --> 09:39.960
Can't believe that the fact that there is no

09:40.640 --> 09:44.840
sort of like well-known my bim bam mythos about your log pillow, which is a

09:45.640 --> 09:47.640
What a bean filled?

09:48.720 --> 09:56.040
Micra what do you call that micro fill like a it's like a beanbag being filled with Justin's for him and then

09:56.040 --> 10:00.680
he carries it like but like draped over a

10:01.120 --> 10:05.520
Usually a strap of his backpack turning it into the brawniest

10:06.160 --> 10:11.840
Nutsack that you have ever seen and he walks through the air every airport like that

10:11.840 --> 10:17.200
And there's kids around and they then they seen it. Yeah, I mean, yeah

10:18.040 --> 10:20.040
What do you want me to say here?

10:20.040 --> 10:26.600
Um, you introduced this topic by the way, we didn't make you bring up the log pillow you brought a bill

10:26.600 --> 10:30.640
Yeah, I mean I have probs. I'm just saying I have props and if I don't have my can't sleep

10:30.640 --> 10:37.040
I've tried other things I've in in hotel rooms. I've gotten desperate and wadded up towels into kind of a long shape

10:37.040 --> 10:41.600
We've all been there. We've all been there wadded up a hoodie, you know to try to make it no

10:42.800 --> 10:47.160
It's not just bedroom prop when I'm away from my favorite toilet

10:47.160 --> 10:51.960
My toilet buddy that I know like I know yeah, I know how he works

10:51.960 --> 10:57.520
I know I know where I know where I like to look for the tough moments

10:57.520 --> 10:57.920
You know what?

10:57.920 --> 11:03.360
I mean, like I know the point on the wall that I'm making eye contact with but I'm struggling like I know

11:03.840 --> 11:07.200
You know where you've etched your Vince Lombardi quotes

11:09.960 --> 11:16.640
I was getting tough. I know exactly and I know where the tally marks are for every successful completion

11:16.640 --> 11:21.240
You know what I mean? Yeah, by the way, I was at your house the other day and there's only six

11:21.760 --> 11:24.800
Yeah, man. Why do you think I need so many motivational quotes?

11:25.720 --> 11:30.120
It's tough out there. I don't eat fiber. Yeah

11:30.800 --> 11:32.800
I just eat cheese

11:32.920 --> 11:35.680
Yeah, get a good night's sleep with someone else's house

11:36.680 --> 11:43.400
There is a certain point of like there's a reason why I think maybe oh I have a rectangle pillow. Yes

11:43.400 --> 11:46.400
Well, yeah, yeah cube. Oh

11:48.360 --> 11:55.520
Wait, what? Yeah, it's a pillow cube and I can't sleep without that either. It's a cube shaped pillow. Where does it go?

11:55.520 --> 11:57.020
Where does the cube go?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.320
Well

11:58.320 --> 12:03.440
Supporting this beautiful thinker right here. Okay, right underneath the old knock. Yeah, let's go

12:03.440 --> 12:06.480
I yeah, I've searched high and low. Do you know how many pillows?

12:06.480 --> 12:12.280
I've I've had to shove down on my garbage disposal because they didn't give my head the support it crave

12:12.280 --> 12:18.760
Like as a punishment what like as a punishment for them disappointing. I mean, it's a sack. It's a sacrifice

12:18.760 --> 12:23.760
Oh, I see. Yeah, I see but I think that I can't remember the last time

12:24.080 --> 12:28.400
Like I think 24 was maybe the last time I slept at a friend's house

12:28.920 --> 12:33.400
Because I was too drunk to drive so I simply slept on his couch

12:33.440 --> 12:38.380
But it was not like a planned thing where I looked at my friend Bradbury and said and I'll bring my jammies

12:38.380 --> 12:43.780
Like I just don't and I think the reason is not like oh, it's weird to sleep at a friend's house when you get older

12:43.780 --> 12:50.140
It's like oh no, this isn't like fun to get away from my parents and my house. This is like, oh no

12:50.900 --> 12:57.740
Everything I know is back there. That's where I'm truly me and I can take off this mask that I wear for others

12:59.100 --> 13:03.620
Hey, can we approach the wizard? Yeah. Yeah. I like that. Thank you. The other

13:03.620 --> 13:10.180
Was close. He's bitey the other wizard Ben can't sent this in. Thank you, Ben. Um, this is a this is one

13:10.180 --> 13:12.060
That's again very useful

13:12.060 --> 13:14.780
For me is a sort of like Gen Z

13:15.460 --> 13:22.700
Yeah, like yeah, I live on I live and die on like emo emojis and texts not me. I'm a boomer

13:22.700 --> 13:29.060
I don't get that stuff. Yeah. Yeah, so me and my Gen Z friends are gonna love this one. We're gonna bust up super hard

13:29.060 --> 13:34.420
It's not so I thought it was just gins gins me and the felt me and my fellow gins

13:34.820 --> 13:40.260
Are gonna love 13 clever ways to respond to what's up, or what's up? Thank you. Ah

13:40.820 --> 13:42.820
That age-old question

13:43.460 --> 13:45.180
It's not

13:45.180 --> 13:47.860
It is as old as time itself. What's up?

13:48.020 --> 13:53.660
You might was up you might have heard it thrown around so often that it's hard to come up with a fresh and creative answer

13:53.660 --> 13:55.660
Yes in 1999

13:55.660 --> 14:01.420
Uh, don't worry though. We've got you covered with tons of examples that show how to have some fun with this common question

14:01.420 --> 14:07.200
Read on and try them out to respond to wassup in a way that will breathe new life into your conversation

14:07.740 --> 14:13.980
Hey, have you talked to mark lately? Yeah, it's good. It's good to talk to him now. It feels

14:15.620 --> 14:20.100
Revitalizing yeah, just the way that his mind works. It really excites me

14:20.100 --> 14:28.160
Well his responses to my mundane inane questions are a breath of fresh air and this otherwise empty landscape on which I live

14:28.660 --> 14:34.500
So here's one way to respond to wassup of 13 after seeing you my mood

14:35.500 --> 14:37.160
Anyone?

14:37.160 --> 14:39.540
Compliment anyone who could use an extra boost of confidence

14:39.540 --> 14:42.940
This is a great reply for everyone in your life from a friend to acquaintance

14:43.020 --> 14:48.220
It's an especially effective answer if the person is shy or isn't used to the attention

14:48.220 --> 14:53.820
Fuck here's some more examples in this vein now that you're talking to me my happiness now

14:53.860 --> 14:59.260
It's that's weirder though because now that's starting to trend into the way an alien would say it

15:01.820 --> 15:04.340
After this conversation that we had with our mouths

15:05.380 --> 15:08.420
My endorphins like oh no. No, hold on

15:09.100 --> 15:15.480
With you in the room my energy level after after learning you went to Spain my curiosity

15:15.480 --> 15:18.400
Is up another way

15:19.720 --> 15:23.120
Someone hits you with a wassup you hit him with a I don't have any complaints

15:23.720 --> 15:26.640
Stay upbeat if you want to charm a stranger with your optimism

15:26.760 --> 15:32.960
If you want to build rapport with someone or leave them in a with a wonderful first impression be really cheerful and smile other options

15:32.960 --> 15:40.840
I'm a happy camper life's been treating me really well. That's a serious darkness. There's a darkness behind those no complaints here

15:40.840 --> 15:45.200
I mean everything's looking up. I've made a lot of progress lately with what?

15:45.760 --> 15:50.240
Mm-hmm. Hey, I think we live in a time a current

15:50.240 --> 15:55.120
I won't go deep into it folks, but if you have no complaints, that's no complaints

15:55.120 --> 16:04.080
If you can say nothing but good news on my end. I'm very grateful. All right, asshole. Yeah should be there is

16:04.080 --> 16:10.440
Objectively bad news out there and you saying that it doesn't impact you at all is is is

16:10.880 --> 16:17.640
Monstrous, and I hey listen, there's enough bad news to go around. It doesn't matter what side of any issue you're on

16:18.360 --> 16:22.080
Nobody's got it all good right now. How about this wassup?

16:22.720 --> 16:28.120
Hopefully not my rent get creative at a party and point out what you don't want to go up

16:28.120 --> 16:31.600
Hopefully not my dick while people are around that would be inappropriate

16:31.600 --> 16:38.440
Not the time for that. It better not be my cholesterol levels. I've been eating healthy dot-dot-dot not my student loans

16:38.440 --> 16:44.520
I just have to keep making my payments with any luck not my grocery bill. I'm not buying name-brands anymore

16:44.520 --> 16:46.520
I would turn heel and walk

16:47.720 --> 16:51.920
Out of there would be gone from my yeah awareness

16:53.520 --> 16:58.560
In a perfect world my salary make your bestie laugh with a sassy response

16:58.560 --> 17:01.960
That's that is sassy. Yeah, I say that's sassy

17:02.640 --> 17:09.320
Okay, you know what actually on that one if I walked up to my best friend Hank Mardukas and I said what's up?

17:09.320 --> 17:14.240
And he said hopefully my salary I would high-five him three times for sure

17:14.240 --> 17:21.160
That's sassy and fun solid response. And this is the obligatory. What's up? If life was fair my grades

17:21.900 --> 17:23.600
My energy grades up. Yeah

17:23.600 --> 17:29.600
My energy levels if I had my way a lot of concern about my energy about my fate on now

17:29.600 --> 17:33.280
I want to go back though because I like if life was fair

17:33.440 --> 17:37.000
my grace because that one means is like I'm putting in the fucking work and

17:37.360 --> 17:41.960
Mr. Fucking Johnson is being a real asshole cuz I did that assignment

17:41.960 --> 17:48.360
He knows I did and yet he's still giving me a see life's not fair me. My atheist teacher gave me an F

17:49.440 --> 17:51.600
It's because I love our troops so much

17:51.600 --> 17:53.320
How

17:53.320 --> 17:58.800
Much what's up? How much time do you have do this one? No, don't do that one

17:59.600 --> 18:04.680
Can you sticker it does say play around with anyone easy to fool like an unsuspecting relative. So it's like

18:05.360 --> 18:07.920
Punk them by hinting at some deep

18:08.880 --> 18:12.560
Trouble in your life that you do need assistance with can you stick around for a bit?

18:12.560 --> 18:17.520
I'll need at least 20 minutes. How long is your attention span? I'm in the mood to overshare. Okay

18:17.520 --> 18:22.600
Let me tell you my life story. Just joking Wow. Hey any one of those

18:22.600 --> 18:27.760
I actually would appreciate it because it would be shorthand for like, oh, okay. I don't want to know you

18:27.760 --> 18:34.040
I don't want to talk to you. I'm gonna overshare. Oh, thank you for the warning. I'll be over here at the Cheeto Bowl

18:34.040 --> 18:37.240
I love it. Some of you know like I've asked you not to be like this

18:37.720 --> 18:44.520
Yeah, we we incur we encounter each other in social situations. I've asked you not to be like this

18:44.520 --> 18:50.320
I think it's also not oversharing. I asked you how you are and I it's I guess it depends on if you're like

18:50.320 --> 18:52.320
What's up, man? And he's like

18:52.600 --> 18:57.720
Or if you're just like hey, what's up with you? And he's like I want to overshare. I'm like, yeah, I I did just ask

18:58.440 --> 19:01.680
Like I would up with you. I would take literally any response

19:02.200 --> 19:08.600
Other than this one number six on the list. What's up our time on earth? So let's make the most of it. What?

19:08.600 --> 19:14.760
Oh, no, shake things up and motivate whoever is talking to you if they're on autopilot and asking a basic question

19:14.760 --> 19:19.720
See if you can inspire them and tell them to live every moment. Like it's their last don't what's up?

19:19.720 --> 19:22.320
Our chances to waste another moment. Let's go

19:22.820 --> 19:27.640
Now that one though is confusing verbiage. What's up? Our chances to wait. Sorry

19:28.640 --> 19:34.920
Run out of chances. Some of us are out here barely coping with existential dread as it is

19:34.920 --> 19:38.620
Well, yeah, I see you at a party and I say what's up and you're like art

19:40.120 --> 19:45.840
I'm in a spiral now. Thank you actually true either. It's like we're both here like what are you talking about?

19:45.840 --> 19:48.560
What do you know that what do you know Matt Damon in that?

19:49.160 --> 19:55.560
Kevin Smith movie and you're like your time is up on earth. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah

19:57.000 --> 20:03.120
Matt Damon gets a gun out. It's like fuck. Do you guys remember the Bitcoin commercial where he was like?

20:03.120 --> 20:09.000
Get bitcoins and he pulled out two guns and I was like, whoa, I was like, are you gonna hurt me?

20:09.000 --> 20:13.840
And he was like, no, you can just look cool. Like me Jason Bourne. These are my new bitcoins. They're guns

20:14.440 --> 20:19.240
I need to test them the real quick. You guys gotta let me know if this works. Okay. Okay, can you let me know?

20:19.240 --> 20:21.240
This works. Yeah

20:22.120 --> 20:25.840
Yeah, I remember him yeah, I like I liked him from

20:25.840 --> 20:34.160
Yeah, you have to comment on it in order for it to be fair you

20:34.760 --> 20:40.560
Hold on wait Travis. You can't talk over that. What was it? Go ahead juice. You'll get a taco bear. Oh, yeah

20:40.920 --> 20:43.520
What sound what are you on? Is it just like classic?

20:45.560 --> 20:49.940
Okay, yeah, these are some of the most sort of like low quality

20:49.940 --> 20:56.820
Little bit right. Do you have the Dell guy? He's funny. What do you have the Dell guy? It's got to be in there

20:59.580 --> 21:07.580
Now that's Intel Intel. Yeah, that's not it. Okay, so there's a lot more of these what's up? Who paid you to ask me?

21:09.780 --> 21:11.780
Feel like you're not dialed anymore

21:12.260 --> 21:17.340
I'm back. I'm back. I'm back pretend to be suspicious to put on a show for your friends have the secret agents found me

21:17.340 --> 21:19.380
What have you told them? Hey, that's not cool of you to ask

21:19.380 --> 21:24.460
You know, I'm on the run. I'm not sure how to answer that. Do you have a wire on you? Oh my that's a good one

21:26.060 --> 21:30.420
If someone asked me in a party what's up and I say why are you asking are you wearing a wire?

21:30.540 --> 21:35.620
That is a good way to like kid on the square to gauge of your friends an arc. Yeah

21:36.940 --> 21:40.860
As somebody who has trouble with social situations

21:40.900 --> 21:43.060
Yeah, especially like these sort of conversational things

21:43.060 --> 21:50.000
I think it should be illegal for the internet to publish a list of memorizable responses

21:50.060 --> 21:51.660
Yeah to

21:51.660 --> 21:55.180
Banal questions because that's not that's not right

21:55.180 --> 22:01.580
Like I know I know that is memorizing answers that are supposed to be witty. That's not good

22:01.580 --> 22:03.580
You don't want to do that

22:04.060 --> 22:09.580
This list should be one thing long and it should be not much you not much that is okay

22:09.580 --> 22:14.980
I'll go ahead and spoil number 13 is not much you which is I think the only acceptable way

22:14.980 --> 22:21.860
That's the only one it should be. How's your day? Great you what's up? Not much you. Hey, how's your weekend?

22:21.860 --> 22:28.740
Pretty good. It should like three words max should be your response to a thing. I I don't want a monologue

22:29.900 --> 22:36.900
I'm a human being who's bad at small talk and I had to say something because we locked eyes and we're sharing a physical space

22:36.900 --> 22:40.300
Right. So I said hey, what's up? That's you know

22:40.540 --> 22:46.500
Sorry, the conceit of this bit is that it's not that rarely the things that the wizard sends us are good

22:46.740 --> 22:54.900
Yes, but now it's a thing where I'm imagining myself actually being in my physical meat body and someone saying one of these things

22:54.900 --> 22:58.860
To me and having to like roll out of the room as quickly as possible

23:00.420 --> 23:05.100
Maybe you can maybe this will be better for you guys not me because like I'm a

23:05.100 --> 23:10.180
Good like cool confident popular. Yeah. Yeah guys, but like if someone says what's up

23:10.180 --> 23:15.920
You could say when you ask that question my anxiety levels. Yeah. Oh, that's okay. Can I say?

23:16.700 --> 23:23.020
There is a delivery you can put on that or it would work. I think that one that one I could

23:23.700 --> 23:29.120
Yeah, that could work. Yeah, don't now that you have asked me such a banal question. My anxiety currently

23:29.120 --> 23:37.340
Is up now and then if you really want it, I don't know that these three they escalate it with each additional one under this suggestion

23:38.080 --> 23:42.240
With my blood pressure. What a loaded question moving on

23:44.240 --> 23:46.240
No, not at all yikes

23:46.600 --> 23:53.160
Yikes my discomfort. That's way too hard to answer. What's up? Oh, I didn't expect the test

23:53.160 --> 23:58.580
Oh, okay. What if someone said what's up? And you just look like yikes

23:59.680 --> 24:02.160
Whoa, that would be a good way of answer

24:02.860 --> 24:08.680
Much when I go shopping and I'm buying a bunch of groceries and the checkout person says oh playing on a fun weekend

24:08.680 --> 24:12.640
Cuz maybe there's like two bottles of wine in there. I think a good response now is like well not now

24:13.320 --> 24:17.800
Now I'm gonna be thinking about this moment for the rest of the weekend because I'm worried about too many

24:17.800 --> 24:20.300
I don't know hot dogs wrapped in pastry or whatever

24:20.300 --> 24:27.400
No, you ever analyze whenever you buy like like I get my I get my my looker at CVS

24:27.600 --> 24:32.080
Yeah, and like a glassy jet. Yeah, I end up a lot of times getting like

24:32.880 --> 24:35.720
liquor and toilet paper or liquor and

24:37.840 --> 24:42.040
Hemorrhoid cream it's like yeah, these two it is gonna be a pretty wild weekend

24:42.040 --> 24:47.000
It's gonna get pretty silly, but then I'm gonna bring it down and think about motivational quotes from Vince Lombardi

24:47.000 --> 24:54.040
I got this Gatorade. I'll play it out cuz I your boys bad with with moderation. Yeah, where do you keep the PD light too?

24:56.040 --> 25:00.200
Bad with moderation good with preparation, so I went ahead and got me some

25:01.280 --> 25:06.520
Preparation age some raw. Hey, can I get sexy real quick? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks

25:06.800 --> 25:13.520
What's up? My hopes because you swiped right on me. Oh, no right the good one or which one is the good one?

25:13.520 --> 25:15.520
I will never know with enough confidence

25:15.520 --> 25:20.280
Yeah, you could also if you want to keep being really flirty and spark up a romance with a new crush

25:20.280 --> 25:27.320
You can say my heart rate now that you're giving me the time of day my level of attraction your IG hypnotized me

25:28.680 --> 25:30.680
What's up? What's up? Imagine?

25:32.040 --> 25:34.840
Imagine I can't traction is up

25:36.920 --> 25:38.920
See my lady

25:39.520 --> 25:42.640
Humans I want to say that my attraction is up to you

25:42.640 --> 25:46.020
I'm definitely not a lizard that has gained access to a keyboard

25:46.760 --> 25:50.560
What's up? My pulse your pics and your bio are so spellbinding

25:54.680 --> 26:01.800
These are texts these are text mess. We're texting now. We're yeah, we're texting now. We've been texting and then there's some asshole

26:02.760 --> 26:05.080
Responses the next two subjects are all asshole

26:05.080 --> 26:12.280
Um, what's up? The opposite of down nice a two-letter preposition. You're welcome for the grammar lesson. Not that

26:13.760 --> 26:18.720
Honestly go just fall in a well, what's up a super cute movie that made me cry check it out

26:18.720 --> 26:22.960
Thank you that that would be good. I don't know that I would respond

26:22.960 --> 26:28.880
I don't I don't think I would call up a cute movie. What's up? Come on, you know that the sky

26:28.880 --> 26:34.520
Um, what are you getting part birds planes and on a good day UFOs?

26:34.520 --> 26:37.400
Is that a good day when they finally do?

26:37.960 --> 26:41.800
Get tired of tolerating us and they come and they zap

26:42.000 --> 26:46.980
You know, they zap us into dust with their big tripod ships probably I think you could do

26:47.200 --> 26:53.840
There could be a sincere delivery of come on, you know this you can do this. You got this. I believe in you

26:53.840 --> 26:55.840
What's up

26:57.800 --> 26:59.800
I'm not gonna do the rest. But the last one is

27:00.560 --> 27:01.680
Not much

27:01.680 --> 27:05.560
nothing not much just that's the only correct answer to that question because it's

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
All they're looking for if they really wanted some detail about how you found their picks and bio spellbinding

27:13.120 --> 27:19.100
They would have said like what what do you think? What is it about me that spellbinding? Yeah

27:20.080 --> 27:22.080
exactly

27:22.080 --> 27:24.320
Just a keen play the beer joke again

27:25.000 --> 27:26.560
what

27:26.560 --> 27:31.040
What the joke the beers the beer the beer joke from the commercial? Oh

27:31.800 --> 27:34.560
It's too late now. No all the moment is past

27:35.680 --> 27:37.680
Yeah, well dad

27:38.160 --> 27:40.160
You're my dad

27:41.280 --> 27:43.280
And I love you man

27:43.600 --> 27:45.600
That one that one

27:46.200 --> 27:51.560
Wow, what was that? I love I love you, man. That was not as big of a hit back in the day

27:51.560 --> 27:57.120
I'm out a little bit. I'm out in the boneyard a little yeah, I went to the bathroom

27:57.800 --> 28:04.720
At a local grocery store and I was about to leave my stall and someone came in crying and started to give themselves a pep

28:04.720 --> 28:07.760
Talk in the mirror. I don't know if they know I'm with me

28:08.200 --> 28:12.880
But I would like to leave is it acceptable to go wash my hands next to them as they have their moment

28:13.200 --> 28:15.200
That was from bathroom boohoo, buddy

28:17.280 --> 28:19.280
Are you an older person

28:19.280 --> 28:22.900
Who can provide a sort of sagacious?

28:23.440 --> 28:26.400
Little little little bit a little monologue for them

28:26.400 --> 28:26.640
Yeah

28:26.640 --> 28:32.960
Or an older person that could pretend you're them from the future who just came back to tell him that everything is gonna work out

28:32.960 --> 28:36.520
Just fine. Yeah, that one might be tough depending on like

28:38.000 --> 28:43.560
If you look nothing like them at all at all, I don't know what what the future holds driven

28:43.560 --> 28:50.640
Yeah, maybe carry around like a cyber mask with you everywhere you go and that's great. You're in the stall

28:50.640 --> 28:55.280
You're in the bathroom and you hear somebody crying out in the sink area the hand-washing zone

28:55.440 --> 28:56.440
And you're like, okay

28:56.440 --> 29:01.440
Hold on and you pull on the sort of like lycra suit and cyber mask and then you walk out of the stall like

29:02.120 --> 29:04.920
It helps if you have some like DJ equipment with you

29:04.920 --> 29:05.320
Yeah

29:05.320 --> 29:09.680
I got some a machine and a light show and you can be like contain your moisture

29:09.680 --> 29:16.320
Ever and they're like whoa what and you're like, yeah, I'm you from the future. I'm a robot cyber DJ

29:16.320 --> 29:19.960
I guess if this is the case you don't have to be an older person. Yeah, anyone could do that

29:20.440 --> 29:27.160
Anyone could be that with a little forethought anyone can do that and you could say like I am you from the future

29:27.160 --> 29:35.080
I do look younger than you but that's because that's time dilation. So good. So that and that's Einstein said that I

29:35.080 --> 29:39.720
I feel like if I went out there when they're in the middle of their of their

29:40.280 --> 29:47.680
Challenging episode that might be a little too disorienting cuz like imagine if one of your favorite podcasters just appeared out of nowhere

29:49.680 --> 29:54.040
Justin McElroy is in this bathroom and I'd be like

29:55.080 --> 29:57.360
Guilty as charged. Well, that's how can you say?

29:57.360 --> 30:04.560
Well, your friends paid for what we're calling a real-life cameo and so I I'm here waiting for you to come in

30:04.560 --> 30:10.080
So I could tell you hey, man, everything's gonna be okay, and make sure to check out trolls world tour

30:12.920 --> 30:18.600
Residuals on that one baby, you guys would not believe do you buy that on we're gonna need you to buy a physical copy

30:19.000 --> 30:23.480
But I know that that's not cool these days, but they have them here at the store

30:23.480 --> 30:27.920
I just saw a big display of them by the front. Hey real-life sidebar

30:28.720 --> 30:30.320
if I

30:30.320 --> 30:31.840
had known

30:31.840 --> 30:38.020
That when you do parts in a movie, they keep sending you money for no reason

30:38.080 --> 30:42.180
Yeah, I would have tried to be in movies long ago

30:45.640 --> 30:47.640
We're not putting in a hot tub with this

30:49.120 --> 30:54.040
This is a very small bit of money, but it does come for no reason for no reason

30:54.040 --> 31:02.820
And it's just a little surprise letter from our friends at DreamWorks. Hey guys, here's 20 bucks. Thanks Wow 20

31:04.600 --> 31:11.080
Love that if I was getting $20 checks from trolls world tour, I'd be I'd be a happy young guy

31:11.080 --> 31:15.400
If you went to babysit and on top of the money, they were paying you a babysit

31:15.400 --> 31:18.440
They said here's some money to order a pizza if you want and you're like

31:18.440 --> 31:26.160
Well, hey, and we'll keep sending you pizza money every few months for no reason for the rest of your life

31:26.600 --> 31:32.960
It's the closest I've come to that feeling of completing the the paper from book it to get a free personal

31:34.400 --> 31:36.880
In my adult life, that's what residuals are

31:37.400 --> 31:42.920
But I know I'm not sure I understood that reference which makes me think that none of our list pizza

31:42.920 --> 31:49.800
Hot book it you pizza help book it you read enough books or get good grades or something you get free pizza free personal pan pizzas

31:49.800 --> 31:56.460
I think it's a real nice moment for human connection. Some of the times I've had in my life that I felt like you know

31:57.280 --> 32:03.680
The hand of any sort of like divine forces or whatever is when I've been there when somebody else is upset

32:03.760 --> 32:07.400
That's great because it doesn't have to be about you for a little bit. You can chill your own problems

32:07.400 --> 32:12.920
Be like hey, let's talk. Let's talk through it. If you feel like it. If not, I'm gonna wash my hands. I'm gonna leave

32:12.920 --> 32:17.480
But right now I'm open book baby. Let's go through it. I'm a stranger who better?

32:17.480 --> 32:17.840
Yeah

32:17.840 --> 32:22.560
This is actually one of those rare times where pretending like it's not happening is what makes it awkward

32:22.960 --> 32:29.680
Like if you just walk out and like eyes forward wash your hands and dry your hands eyes forward and walk out silently

32:29.680 --> 32:36.920
Yeah, now whatever rough time that person's going through they are both embarrassed and isolated where if you come out and like hey

32:37.360 --> 32:44.800
You know you got this or it gets better or whatever and then walk out made it or we all

32:45.040 --> 32:49.400
Agree that being there for someone in their time of need is a very good feeling

32:49.680 --> 32:55.760
So whatever they're giving you from out there in sync zone you walk out of that stall

32:55.760 --> 33:00.000
And you take it you take it up a level escalate

33:00.000 --> 33:06.680
Your life is worse if they're well, you don't have to say that obviously that's not the right thing to do

33:06.680 --> 33:08.600
but if they're giving you like

33:08.600 --> 33:10.600
You come at them with like

33:10.760 --> 33:12.760
Like and you're way more

33:14.880 --> 33:17.120
And then they look at you and they're like wow

33:17.840 --> 33:21.360
Wow, it could be a lot worse. What's going on with you? And then you're gonna have to lie

33:21.360 --> 33:27.440
I'm you know say like, you know, I I just watched up on my phone on the toilet

33:27.640 --> 33:31.880
You could also just walk out covered in blood since they're like, oh no not again

33:31.880 --> 33:37.120
And now you've distracted them from what I've been on such short notice though. Well with a little bit of preparation

33:37.280 --> 33:42.960
It's right there with your in your bag next to your DJ equipment and your cyber helmet. You're coming out on top

33:42.960 --> 33:46.920
What does this situation call for? What are they crying about? Oh, they got fired. Mm-hmm

33:46.920 --> 33:49.400
Is that a blood situation or I'm you from the future?

33:49.400 --> 33:56.640
Oh, you also rip a big one and that's that's a bathroom joke that like everyone really yeah

33:58.160 --> 34:03.080
Griffin I actually think that may be the best advice is if you just like

34:03.840 --> 34:11.400
Simulate a gigantic beaver. There is no time that I've ever heard that in my life that I have not busted up

34:11.400 --> 34:18.560
A hundred. Yeah, I was in the Buc-ee's restroom with Henry helping him do his thing when someone made a break

34:19.560 --> 34:24.480
Someone someone made a rude noise in an adjacent stall and Henry just started laughing

34:24.600 --> 34:29.720
Yeah, and I had to look at him and be like you can't do that. This is a special place

34:30.160 --> 34:34.400
This is a special place where you do that without judgment from five-year-olds

34:34.400 --> 34:38.840
It's the closest the everyday person gets diplomatic immunity. Yeah

34:38.840 --> 34:45.440
Please but I think if you do it when someone's crying they know it's like for their benefit and they'll be like, thank you

34:46.680 --> 34:50.640
So that should work too. A lot of great stuff you can do in the bathroom. It's a funny room

34:50.640 --> 34:55.600
Yeah, we don't talk about this enough. Why don't more people make bathroom jokes? I don't know

34:56.560 --> 35:01.360
Let's take a quick break and then we'll come back with lots more content it to the money zone

35:01.360 --> 35:09.280
Okay, I guess the money zone is content right? Yeah, it's all content baby. It's all content. This is content

35:09.280 --> 35:11.280
Listen, they're paying by the minute. That's all I know

35:20.880 --> 35:22.880
What's to say about

35:23.120 --> 35:25.960
Squarespace that hasn't been said before

35:25.960 --> 35:32.880
Huh? Does anyone know? I mean nothing but they are continuing to pay us to say the same things

35:33.440 --> 35:38.200
Again, so let's respect that. Did you guys know you might not know this

35:39.000 --> 35:42.400
But there are people out there who don't have websites

35:43.240 --> 35:48.160
Yeah, what? Yeah. Can you imagine? Yes, right? What? Okay

35:48.920 --> 35:54.360
But I'm trying to make it like I'm like what why would you cuz Squarespace helps you build your own website where you can like

35:54.360 --> 36:01.800
Showcase, you know your work or like sell things or like blog and publish content all that stuff and some people

36:02.480 --> 36:04.040
Don't do that

36:04.040 --> 36:10.960
Yeah, why what are they afraid of right? Are they afraid of cyber ghosts? Of course, of course

36:10.960 --> 36:17.800
We all are but good news and Squarespace doesn't want me to tell you this but all their stuff is blessed by cyber priests

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
cyber ghost free

36:20.600 --> 36:22.600
100% guaranteed or your money back

36:22.600 --> 36:28.320
Yeah, I said it. I said it and then are you gonna say any of the other things that they want us to say?

36:28.320 --> 36:32.640
No, add copy. Are you just gonna talk mostly about sort of cyber priests?

36:33.560 --> 36:34.520
No, listen

36:34.520 --> 36:40.640
Everybody knows about all their cool stuff right member areas where you can unlock a new revenue stream for your business and free up time

36:40.640 --> 36:46.320
And you get you all by selling access to gated content like video tutorials and online courses or like sell your products

36:46.320 --> 36:51.160
Or like, you know, you can sell physical or digital but all that stuff right but the main worry

36:51.160 --> 36:56.760
Yeah, cyber ghosts. I do think I'm not a hundred percent sure that

36:57.440 --> 36:58.800
ghosts are

36:58.800 --> 36:59.880
the

36:59.880 --> 37:04.920
Main sort of prey for priests. I have always cyber race

37:05.400 --> 37:11.680
Yeah, cyber priests. I think that I feel like like demons and imps are there a more their thing?

37:11.680 --> 37:14.640
But like if you have a ghost in your house, typically you don't

37:15.200 --> 37:16.800
That's not like priest

37:16.800 --> 37:23.040
You're showing your whole ass on this one. Of course cyber ghost is a wide branching like turn umbrella

37:23.200 --> 37:27.720
Right, it covers stuff like cyber demons and cyber imps and cyber devils

37:27.840 --> 37:32.840
And I've warned you multiple times about opening the door to allow Travis to enrich his own mythology

37:32.920 --> 37:35.240
Like, you know, you know what you've done

37:35.240 --> 37:40.060
And so it's just a shorthand to say cyber ghosts and you know

37:40.060 --> 37:44.520
What the fuck the square in the space is a box. They put the ghosts into yes

37:44.520 --> 37:51.520
Now don't open that cyber box. If you don't cyber box shit. Listen, it's a big Twinkie. We all know that right?

37:51.520 --> 37:52.440
It's a big Twinkie

37:52.440 --> 37:57.360
Do not fucking open that cyber box or it's gonna get all over the internet and we're gonna have to deal with that

37:57.680 --> 37:59.680
We're gonna have to deal with that the three of us

Do you have werewolves problems?

38:49.280 --> 38:52.440
Is that a problem with werewolves or a problem werewolves have?

38:52.640 --> 38:58.120
Every time you go out to eat with your family and kids do werewolves come to try to eat your family and kids?

they have

39:15.680 --> 39:17.680
silver katanas

39:18.360 --> 39:22.680
Every Dasher has a silver katana. Are they trained? No

39:22.680 --> 39:24.680
Oh, no

39:26.520 --> 39:28.520
But they I mean they're good

39:34.880 --> 39:40.840
The katana industry doesn't want you to know you're actually more likely to be killed by katana in your home, right?

39:40.840 --> 39:42.560
That's what they don't tell you

39:42.560 --> 39:45.920
But they you know, the hit rate is pretty good

39:45.920 --> 39:53.080

40:30.600 --> 40:36.880
Yeah, they know you're right Travis. Whatever you're about to say is more important than the personal testimony

40:36.880 --> 40:41.320
I was about to deliver for the company that has paid us money to deliver such a personal testimony

40:41.320 --> 40:44.600
What happens podcast go ahead Travis with your question?

40:44.600 --> 40:51.440

40:51.760 --> 40:58.160
Yeah, tending to be the door dasher. What do I well, let me say first of all the stuff still gets to my house

That's door. Dash. They will always deliver even if they have been horrifically mauled by a werewolf. Yeah

41:05.380 --> 41:11.460
Um, it's personally if I might give a personal testimony. It's why I like to leave it at the door option

41:11.540 --> 41:14.460

I want to Munch Squad!

43:48.580 --> 43:52.860
Welcome to Munch Squad's podcast is a podcast profiling the latest Garry's brand eating.

43:52.860 --> 43:56.940
KFC released finger sporks, and I'm not going to talk about it.

43:56.940 --> 44:00.860
Please? Will you please at least tell me what it is?

44:00.860 --> 44:06.700
It's a spork goes in your finger to encourage you to make all their food finger looking good.

44:06.700 --> 44:09.660
Now you can eat your corn with the finger spork.

44:09.660 --> 44:11.580
Does this does the spork?

44:11.580 --> 44:13.100
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

44:13.100 --> 44:14.540
No, no, but I do want to talk about it.

44:14.540 --> 44:19.340
So does the spoon come up from the finger or do you like where do you scoop?

44:19.340 --> 44:21.020
You wear it on your finger.

44:21.020 --> 44:22.700
Right, but are you talking about?

44:22.700 --> 44:24.220
You can wear it either way, Griffin.

44:24.220 --> 44:28.460
It's not, I don't, I can't imagine that it's like an intricate mounting process.

44:28.460 --> 44:33.580
Can I put on five finger sporks and then just pick up my potatoes like that and just go blop blop blop blop blop.

44:33.580 --> 44:34.220
Yep.

44:34.220 --> 44:35.180
Okay, cool.

44:35.180 --> 44:36.620
It's all good stuff.

44:36.620 --> 44:37.660
It's all good.

44:37.660 --> 44:40.780
It's like, you know, just like finger looking.

44:40.780 --> 44:43.420
It's just if you didn't want to talk about it, I don't know why you would.

44:43.420 --> 44:46.140
I'm just telling you that because I'm tired of people trying to bait me.

44:46.140 --> 44:51.900
Yeah, if he's like, like anybody could do a hilarious run about that.

44:51.900 --> 44:52.620
But you know what I mean?

44:52.620 --> 44:54.540
Like we just did like three of them.

44:54.540 --> 44:55.580
We just did great.

44:55.580 --> 45:01.260
And I'm really torn though between these two stories because one's wilder, but what?

45:01.260 --> 45:02.620
Okay, we're going to talk about Subway.

45:03.580 --> 45:08.140
Subway has launched its most significant menu change in 57 years.

45:08.140 --> 45:08.460
Okay.

45:10.060 --> 45:11.420
It's the Subway series.

45:12.380 --> 45:12.940
Okay.

45:12.940 --> 45:15.020
Doesn't sound that significant yet.

45:15.020 --> 45:18.540
Okay, so here's what they've done.

45:18.540 --> 45:22.700
Have they made their shops not stink like the worst stink you ever did?

45:22.700 --> 45:26.220
Are they done ruining combination gas stations and Subways?

45:26.780 --> 45:31.180
It's the biggest menu update in the entire history of the franchise.

45:31.180 --> 45:34.860
It tested hundreds of recipes to come up with the Subway series.

45:34.860 --> 45:40.860
12 new signature sandwiches that can be ordered by name or by number.

45:41.420 --> 45:41.820
Wow.

45:41.820 --> 45:43.740
It's a whole new way to Subway.

45:43.740 --> 45:46.780
Yeah, they're stealing it from Jimmy John's 10 years ago.

45:46.780 --> 45:49.420
Listen, this is going to absolutely freak you out,

45:49.420 --> 45:53.740
but you can now walk into a Subway and say the name of a sandwich

45:53.740 --> 45:56.140
and they'll just give it to you.

45:56.140 --> 45:56.860
No problem.

45:57.500 --> 45:59.020
How did it work before?

46:00.940 --> 46:03.420
Before you had to be like,

46:03.420 --> 46:09.180
okay, so take some yeast and sugar and flour and mix it up and then wait.

46:09.180 --> 46:09.740
I don't know.

46:09.740 --> 46:16.540
But now, you know how you've left a Subway feeling like you just did long form algebra?

46:16.540 --> 46:18.540
You're like, why was that so tough?

46:18.540 --> 46:20.140
Why did they make it so hard?

46:20.140 --> 46:22.540
Why did I have to make eye contact with the person

46:22.540 --> 46:25.740
as their hand hovered over the vegetables and I said, no, no.

46:26.300 --> 46:30.540
Now you can just say, give me the boss.

46:30.540 --> 46:34.940
Yeah, I can just throw myself through the front window of the Subway

46:34.940 --> 46:37.340
and tuck and roll and just yell, eight.

46:37.340 --> 46:39.020
Give me the great garlic.

46:39.020 --> 46:42.300
They say here, the series lineup isn't a swap in ordering options.

46:42.300 --> 46:46.700
Customers can still walk the line and customize their own choices.

46:46.700 --> 46:47.260
Hell yeah.

46:47.260 --> 46:50.780
So in case you were worried that they would say no,

46:50.780 --> 46:53.340
you have to have lettuce or you'll go to jail.

46:54.140 --> 46:57.100
Don't worry, you still can get it without lice.

46:57.660 --> 47:02.780
In tests, the brand found the series to be easier for guests and employees.

47:02.780 --> 47:03.260
No.

47:03.260 --> 47:04.460
This is a quote.

47:04.460 --> 47:08.380
In fact, in Fort Myers, after just a few weeks,

47:08.380 --> 47:14.060
the franchisee reported guests are coming in and ordering the Subway series by number

47:14.060 --> 47:17.900
or asking the great garlic by name.

47:17.900 --> 47:24.620
Imagine after just a few weeks, people relented to this new Subway system

47:24.620 --> 47:31.260
and said, fine, I'll just have a great garlic and I won't try to make it my way.

47:31.260 --> 47:35.580
I just want to say, as I worked at a Jimmy John's where this is the system,

47:35.580 --> 47:38.380
you have the numbers and you have the names.

47:38.380 --> 47:43.340
What you are now doing is requiring, let's just say it,

47:43.340 --> 47:46.140
like underpaid, everybody in this country is underpaid at this point,

47:46.140 --> 47:51.660
underpaid sandwich makers, like having to memorize,

47:51.660 --> 47:55.340
artists, thank you, memorize, and hey, thank you, artists.

47:55.340 --> 47:56.460
And you know what you're doing?

47:56.460 --> 47:57.900
You're making it sandwich by number.

47:57.900 --> 48:04.060
You're taking away the artistry and you're saying you have to memorize the name

48:04.060 --> 48:09.100
so that when I say like, give me, I don't know, the big meaty boy,

48:09.100 --> 48:10.540
and they're like, oh, what's on that?

48:10.540 --> 48:11.340
The boss.

48:11.340 --> 48:12.860
That's what you meant to say.

48:12.860 --> 48:13.340
Sure.

48:13.340 --> 48:14.380
Give me the boss.

48:14.380 --> 48:18.540
I don't think I'm going to go into Subway and order the Mexicali.

48:18.540 --> 48:19.820
I don't think I will.

48:19.820 --> 48:20.780
I don't think I'll do that.

48:20.780 --> 48:23.020
I think I'll just order whatever I feel like.

48:23.020 --> 48:25.580
And then if you want to put a label on it, you go for it.

48:25.580 --> 48:26.860
You call it the Subway.

48:26.860 --> 48:29.260
You go for it. You call it the Justin if you need to.

48:29.260 --> 48:31.820
Well, I just know if I commissioned something from an artist,

48:32.540 --> 48:34.940
I just say like, I want a landscape, right?

48:34.940 --> 48:35.900
And I let them do it.

48:35.900 --> 48:39.340
I'm not going to say like, hey, this is what I want it to look like exactly, right?

48:39.340 --> 48:40.940
Then that's not art.

48:40.940 --> 48:42.380
Yeah, I'm not the artist.

48:42.380 --> 48:42.860
You are.

48:42.860 --> 48:43.900
You're the artist.

48:43.900 --> 48:46.140
As long as it looks like a car just drove over it,

48:46.140 --> 48:48.860
then it's the Subway sandwich that I know and love.

48:48.860 --> 48:49.740
Here's a revolution.

48:49.740 --> 48:51.100
Here's what you do Subway.

48:51.100 --> 48:54.940
I'm going to fill out a questionnaire that has nothing to do with sandwich toppings.

48:54.940 --> 48:57.980
Then the artist is going to read through that and get a vibe from me personally.

48:57.980 --> 49:01.420
You'll be like, oh, Travis likes a cool fall day.

49:01.420 --> 49:03.420
I know exactly what kind of sandwich he wants.

49:03.420 --> 49:04.620
Surprise me.

49:04.620 --> 49:06.300
Like a mixologist.

49:06.300 --> 49:07.580
Surprise me.

49:07.580 --> 49:12.220
A simple hundred question questionnaire that I answer it

49:12.220 --> 49:14.060
and then you give me the sandwich.

49:14.060 --> 49:15.980
Filled out days in advance.

49:15.980 --> 49:17.260
I'm going to come in on Thursday,

49:17.260 --> 49:20.460
so I'm going to fill out this questionnaire on Monday to give you some time.

49:20.460 --> 49:24.620
An incredibly inappropriately intrusive 100 question question.

49:24.620 --> 49:26.060
Oh, yeah, it's very-

49:26.060 --> 49:30.700
Why do you need to know my sexual history in order to make me a roast of beef?

49:30.700 --> 49:32.620
I'm actually sorry, but I do need to-

49:33.740 --> 49:35.500
It's been too long since I've done a Munch Squad

49:35.500 --> 49:37.660
and I need to tell you about this other one too.

49:37.660 --> 49:40.220
It's Hardee's and it is maybe-

49:41.260 --> 49:48.060
This may be the worst, laziest, terrible promotion I've ever heard of in my life.

49:48.060 --> 49:52.460
Hardee's is partnering with NASCAR legend Richard Petty

49:52.460 --> 49:54.860
to promote Chicken Platform.

49:54.860 --> 49:55.260
What?

49:55.260 --> 49:58.060
To promote Chicken Platform.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.060
To promote Chicken Platform.

50:00.780 --> 50:04.060
Hardee's is collaborating with one of the hottest drivers in history.

50:05.020 --> 50:06.300
Sexy as fuck.

50:06.300 --> 50:06.860
Let me see that.

50:06.860 --> 50:08.780
Fucking sexy ass Richard Petty.

50:08.780 --> 50:10.060
Let me check out old Dick Petty.

50:10.620 --> 50:15.660
One of his most popular menu offerings, the hand-breaded Chicken Platform.

50:15.660 --> 50:16.220
That can't be the name of it.

50:16.220 --> 50:19.820
This month, NASCAR Hall of Famer seven-time NASCAR champion.

50:19.820 --> 50:21.020
Come on, say it with me, guys.

50:21.020 --> 50:21.820
You know it.

50:21.820 --> 50:26.300
Seven-time Daytona 500 winner and devoted Hardee's fan.

50:26.300 --> 50:29.980
Richard Petty will be in his home state of North Carolina

50:29.980 --> 50:34.220
to give consumers the bird surprising restaurant goers

50:34.220 --> 50:36.060
with hand-breaded chicken sandwiches.

50:37.340 --> 50:38.860
What is Chicken Platform?

50:40.140 --> 50:42.540
Oh, is it Chicken Platform?

50:42.540 --> 50:44.300
You know, hand-breaded Chicken Platform?

50:44.300 --> 50:45.180
No, but-

50:45.180 --> 50:49.100
It's the idea of hand-breaded chicken sandwiches, I think.

50:49.100 --> 50:49.900
Okay.

50:49.900 --> 50:53.420
So like a platform, like a political platform or like some planks of wood?

50:53.420 --> 50:55.660
It's actually closer to that than you would think, Trav.

50:55.660 --> 50:56.060
Yeah.

50:56.060 --> 51:00.380
I think Hardee, Hardee, where's my, where's my Dick Petty?

51:00.380 --> 51:03.420
Hardee's has always had a special place in my heart

51:03.420 --> 51:05.580
because it feels like a bite of home.

51:05.580 --> 51:06.300
Vroom, vroom.

51:06.300 --> 51:10.220
This seems like an apropos moment to reveal I live in a Hardee's now.

51:11.900 --> 51:17.260
I live in a giant chicken like that James fellow except it's out of a beach, you see.

51:17.260 --> 51:19.660
I live in an assisted living Hardee's.

51:22.460 --> 51:23.020
Vroom, vroom.

51:23.020 --> 51:27.820
They help me with my dressings and some of my various household tasks

51:27.820 --> 51:32.140
and they keep me absolutely slathered in hand-breaded chicken platform.

51:32.140 --> 51:35.420
I'm pretty sure that Hardee's could be more accurately qualified

51:35.420 --> 51:37.820
as a sort of hospice facility.

51:39.100 --> 51:39.900
Ha-spice.

51:39.900 --> 51:45.420
I have been a true fan of Hardee's,

51:45.420 --> 51:48.620
not like some of these fake Hardee's girls you'll hear about.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.580
Oh, you like Hardee's, huh?

51:53.580 --> 51:57.660
Name four Hardee's members in the chicken platform.

51:57.660 --> 52:02.780
Teaming up to celebrate this delicious hand-breaded chicken sandwich is a real treat for me.

52:03.340 --> 52:05.580
Plus, I'm looking forward to joining Hardee's.

52:05.580 --> 52:11.180
I'm in giving the bird a whole new meaning and surprising some deserving fans here in

52:11.180 --> 52:13.020
North Carolina this summer.

52:13.020 --> 52:15.100
Plus, they said I could have a free sandwich.

52:15.660 --> 52:19.900
Petty is popping up at a Hardee's location in the Charlotte, North Carolina area.

52:19.900 --> 52:25.580
There can't be more than 30 to give eligible guests a surprise hand delivery.

52:26.300 --> 52:30.220
What makes you ineligible to get Richard Petty to hand deliver you a sandwich?

52:31.020 --> 52:32.300
Oh, I don't eat chicken.

52:32.300 --> 52:33.180
Oh, fuck.

52:33.180 --> 52:33.900
Oh, fuck.

52:33.900 --> 52:34.620
Okay, my bad.

52:34.620 --> 52:39.500
Well, the hand-breaded chicken platform launched last summer in the midst of the chicken wars

52:39.500 --> 52:44.460
and featured that which the fact that they're using the past tense means that there was

52:44.460 --> 52:47.020
an armistice declared that I am not familiar with.

52:47.020 --> 52:49.420
As far as I know, these wars are still raging out there.

52:51.580 --> 52:57.580
This summer, these three craveable builds are back in the spotlight and are the ultimate

52:58.300 --> 52:59.340
cluck bait.

52:59.340 --> 53:00.060
Nope.

53:00.060 --> 53:01.020
The ultimate what?

53:01.020 --> 53:06.540
The ultimate cluck bait, cluck bait.

53:06.540 --> 53:07.260
What is it?

53:07.260 --> 53:08.300
It's like click bait?

53:09.020 --> 53:10.300
No, it's like cuck bait.

53:11.020 --> 53:12.860
I don't think that's it, Justin.

53:12.860 --> 53:15.100
I think Travis might actually be right on this one.

53:15.100 --> 53:21.500
Each big juicy and crispy piece of 100 premium white meat chicken is hand-breaded, on-site,

53:21.500 --> 53:26.700
and now comes with a very small percentage chance that Richard Petty will give it to you, I guess.

53:26.700 --> 53:35.180
It's just, Richard Petty has been a fan favorite for years and has always brought that extra

53:35.180 --> 53:40.140
flavor to the track like no one else can, just like our hand-breaded chicken.

53:40.700 --> 53:41.500
You know.

53:41.500 --> 53:41.980
What?

53:41.980 --> 53:44.380
It brings extra flavor to the track.

53:44.380 --> 53:45.500
I've lost my way.

53:46.940 --> 53:51.660
I know I kind of rambled on there at the end, but you basically get what I was going for.

53:51.660 --> 53:58.060
But we really value the authenticity of this partnership because Petty is an organic fan.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.380
Yeah, not like some Bieber's.

54:01.180 --> 54:01.660
Not like.

54:03.180 --> 54:10.540
It's just, what they're saying to you now is, this announcement is that if you order

54:10.540 --> 54:16.620
the chicken sandwich platform through the app or the drive-thru, maybe Richard Petty

54:16.620 --> 54:17.500
will give it to you.

54:17.500 --> 54:18.060
Oh, guys.

54:18.060 --> 54:22.460
Which is not a chance that I'd allow for yet, but I guess I do always kind of assume that

54:22.460 --> 54:24.460
maybe Richard Petty will hand my food to me.

54:25.500 --> 54:30.620
Wouldn't that be an amazing turn though if this time Richard Petty is helping the person

54:30.620 --> 54:31.580
in the vehicle.

54:31.580 --> 54:33.660
He's your chicken pit crew.

54:33.660 --> 54:36.220
This time, he's never been on that side before.

54:36.220 --> 54:40.540
He's always been the one in, because I assume now part of the pit crew duties for Richard

54:40.540 --> 54:44.940
Petty was handing him a chicken sandwich from Hardee's every time he stopped in every race.

54:44.940 --> 54:51.740
I think that Hardee's is trying to throw shade at the KFC Jack Harlow collab by saying,

54:51.740 --> 54:53.420
oh, it's not real shit.

54:53.420 --> 54:56.300
Like, what us and Dick have is real.

54:56.300 --> 54:57.980
This is real.

54:57.980 --> 54:59.340
He's a real American.

54:59.340 --> 55:07.180
I feel like this is a bad campaign because the very last thing that I want is to be at

55:07.180 --> 55:13.900
a chicken platform restaurant and order some food and then a celebrity that I do not know

55:13.900 --> 55:20.460
who it is, hands it to me and gives me a knowing smile like, vroom, vroom, order up.

55:20.460 --> 55:23.340
And I'll be like, thank you, mustache.

55:23.340 --> 55:25.180
Thank you, mustache gentleman.

55:25.180 --> 55:27.740
Thank you, 85-year-old Hardee's employee.

55:27.740 --> 55:28.860
Very much appreciate.

55:28.860 --> 55:29.820
I like your hat.

55:29.820 --> 55:30.780
I didn't know that that was-

55:30.780 --> 55:31.580
I like your hat too.

55:32.380 --> 55:32.940
What's your name?

55:32.940 --> 55:36.540
Let me check out your name tag, as I always do because I'm a father of two.

55:36.540 --> 55:38.540
Richard, thank you very much.

55:38.540 --> 55:40.140
Richard, I appreciate you.

55:40.140 --> 55:42.860
Because my brain would, honest to God, kick into.

55:42.860 --> 55:44.220
He's looking at me pretty hard.

55:44.220 --> 55:45.980
Does he listen to my brother, my brother and me?

55:45.980 --> 55:51.980
This is, when they say eligible guests, I think they are talking about like checking

55:51.980 --> 55:56.300
the date on your driver's license because Richard Petty has, I looked it up real quick.

55:56.300 --> 56:01.340
He is an 85-year-old man that has not driven professionally for 30 years.

56:01.340 --> 56:06.540
His last ride, it was in 1992 professionally.

56:07.420 --> 56:11.740
The Wikipedia says he was in his twilight years as of 1980.

56:11.740 --> 56:18.620
Like you have to, as they're coming through, like, and one other question, no reason,

56:18.620 --> 56:21.260
but do you know who Richard Petty is?

56:21.260 --> 56:23.020
Okay, go on in, go on in.

56:23.020 --> 56:23.580
Go on in.

56:23.580 --> 56:23.820
Yeah.

56:23.820 --> 56:26.700
On site though, do you know Richard Petty?

56:26.700 --> 56:29.180
If you saw this man, would you recognize him?

56:29.180 --> 56:31.420
They hold up a picture, like a headshot.

56:31.420 --> 56:35.180
He's standing back in the kitchen, just holding the bag, just like looking like,

56:36.620 --> 56:37.660
do they know me?

56:37.660 --> 56:37.900
No.

56:37.900 --> 56:38.780
Oh, okay.

56:38.780 --> 56:40.220
Listen, this is-

56:40.220 --> 56:43.420
Hey, Richard, while you wait, if you could sweep up back there.

56:43.420 --> 56:44.460
That would be great.

56:44.460 --> 56:47.260
Our pop culture is increasingly stratified.

56:47.260 --> 56:50.380
We have no monoculture to hold us together anymore.

56:50.380 --> 56:54.220
I have the narrowest possible sliver of celebrity.

56:54.780 --> 56:58.940
More people would know me as the guy who uploaded the berries and cream sound than

56:58.940 --> 57:00.940
for my entire professional career.

57:00.940 --> 57:05.820
You would have to like bring in the people that it would be exciting for me.

57:05.820 --> 57:09.260
There's like 30 people that would be excited at a Hardee's to have me behind

57:09.260 --> 57:10.780
the drive-through.

57:10.780 --> 57:10.940
Yeah.

57:12.060 --> 57:13.260
I'm not against that though.

57:13.260 --> 57:17.100
If somebody wants to fly some people out to be excited by the three of us handing them

57:17.100 --> 57:19.100
a sandwich, yeah, I'd do it.

57:19.100 --> 57:22.460
Hardee Hardee's with the McElroy brothers, and you can have that, Hardee's.

57:23.020 --> 57:23.740
You can use that.

57:23.740 --> 57:24.300
That's for free.

57:25.420 --> 57:27.260
I mean, it will, I mean-

57:27.260 --> 57:27.900
No, I want to get paid.

57:27.900 --> 57:29.740
Wipe like six figures, but yeah, sure.

57:30.460 --> 57:31.420
The idea is free.

57:31.420 --> 57:34.060
The execution will be quite expensive.

57:34.060 --> 57:35.900
Hey, Justin, will you read this third question real quick?

57:35.900 --> 57:38.860
Because I think that we can nail it down really fast.

57:38.860 --> 57:39.660
Oh, okay, sure.

57:39.660 --> 57:41.020
I collect VHS tapes.

57:41.020 --> 57:45.340
Not too long ago, I acquired a big bad Beatleburg's VHS tape that did not have a case.

57:45.340 --> 57:48.300
Needless to say, I rushed home to watch the tape, but when it started, it had a message

57:48.300 --> 57:51.020
that ran across the top of the screen saying that it was a preview copy.

57:51.020 --> 57:54.380
And if I purchase this tape, I need to call the number on the screen to report it to Fox

57:54.380 --> 57:55.020
Video.

57:55.020 --> 57:56.700
My question is, am I good?

57:56.700 --> 57:57.820
Do I need to report this?

57:57.820 --> 57:59.260
Has too much time passed?

57:59.260 --> 58:01.580
If I do report it, will they take this tape from me?

58:01.580 --> 58:04.620
That's for mystified in Mississippi.

58:04.620 --> 58:05.500
You can't report it.

58:05.500 --> 58:09.180
In fact, you should, you need to hide it.

58:09.180 --> 58:11.020
Yeah, that's contraband.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.020
They won't take the tape from you.

58:13.020 --> 58:15.660
They will take you from your home.

58:16.380 --> 58:19.020
And you will not be seen again.

58:19.980 --> 58:21.020
You know too much.

58:21.020 --> 58:24.860
You know the uncorrected big bad Beatleburg's episodes.

58:24.860 --> 58:27.820
Like before they edited out all the racy stuff.

58:27.820 --> 58:29.340
Like you can't be allowed to say the song.

58:29.340 --> 58:35.820
And by racy, you mean racist because the genie character was way more explicitly

58:35.820 --> 58:38.700
problematic and challenging in the original cut.

58:39.340 --> 58:42.140
And also, can I just say, now you've implicated us in this.

58:42.140 --> 58:43.260
You put us at risk.

58:43.260 --> 58:50.540
And now we're going to have to go on tour just until the heat dies down at this point.

58:50.540 --> 58:51.820
Where should we go, Trav?

58:51.820 --> 58:53.020
Oh, that's such a good question.

58:53.020 --> 58:54.380
I was thinking maybe like Salt Lake City.

58:54.380 --> 58:55.420
They'll never look for us there.

58:56.060 --> 58:57.020
And then to Portland.

58:57.020 --> 58:58.940
And then we can blend in with people.

58:58.940 --> 59:00.780
I'm as surprised to find us there as anybody.

59:00.780 --> 59:02.620
I'm as surprised to find us there as anyone.

59:02.620 --> 59:04.860
San Diego Comic Con will be a good place to blend in.

59:04.860 --> 59:06.460
We'll do some Deadpool cosplay.

59:07.020 --> 59:08.300
No one will ever find us.

59:10.460 --> 59:15.580
Unless you buy tickets at, you know, macro.family or you go to bit.ly slash McRoy Tours.

59:15.580 --> 59:18.060
Then you might be able to find us at those places.

59:19.260 --> 59:23.420
Salt Lake City is like, I guess, the only place they could really nab us

59:23.420 --> 59:25.340
because that's the only show that's not sold out.

59:26.140 --> 59:27.660
Thank you, Portland and San Diego.

59:27.660 --> 59:28.140
We're back, baby.

59:28.140 --> 59:29.900
Yay. November.

59:29.900 --> 59:34.060
We're also going to be in my new hometown of Washington, D.C., Detroit, and Cincinnati.

59:34.060 --> 59:34.780
My hometown.

59:34.780 --> 59:36.700
Justin, you got to move to Detroit real quick.

59:36.700 --> 59:37.820
You can move back.

59:37.820 --> 59:38.300
If you have questions-

59:38.300 --> 59:39.260
They won't have me there.

59:39.260 --> 59:39.900
Oh, yeah.

59:39.900 --> 59:41.180
Not after the Star Wars thing.

59:41.980 --> 59:45.740
Email us questions at nbmbam at maximumfun.org

59:45.740 --> 59:48.780
with the city of the tour stop in the subject line

59:48.780 --> 59:51.260
so we can build up those question lists.

59:51.260 --> 59:53.580
You got to wear a mask and have proof of full vaccination

59:53.580 --> 59:55.820
or a negative COVID test within 72 hours of the event.

59:55.820 --> 01:00:00.140
Start, if you want, if you want to ride with me at these shows.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:00.940
Yeah, no scrubs.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.460
And a reminder, with Gryffindor moving,

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.820
we're going to have a couple of live episodes in a row there

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.700
while he gets settled in and can set up equipment and all that stuff.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.740
Please understand.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.900
Please, your understanding is needed, please.

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.420
Over at the merch store,

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.900
we got the Approach the Wizard shirt designed by Dina Wagner

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.940
and 10% of all merch proceeds this month

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:24.060
go to the Trans Youth Equality Foundation.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.700
You can find all that stuff at mcrormerch.com

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.380
and pre-orders for Taz 11th Hour are now open.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.940
It comes out February 21st, 2023.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.460
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com to pre-order.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.220
Thank you to Montaigne for the use for a theme song.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.420
My life is better with you.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:44.460
It's a track that will get that booty slapping.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:45.260
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.580
It's also worth noting

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.220
we're going to be doing some panels and stuff

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.060
as well at San Diego Comic Con.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.180
I know dad and I are doing one Sunday morning at 10 a.m.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.020
all about influencing the next generation of nerds.

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.260
And it's gonna be with Bria Ingar

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.820
and B. Dave Walters and Johnny Stanton.

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:07.740
It's gonna be super fun and very, I don't know, good.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.500
And you'll like it or else.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.100
Fun and good.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:11.820
Yeah, fun and good.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.100
We'll tweet out those locations

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.700
and post the schedule and everything

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.660
so you can find us at all those

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.100
because we're doing a Taz panel too.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:17.820
It's gonna be great.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.700
We'll see you there.

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.420
Oh my gosh.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:20.780
Oh my gosh.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.100
I've been working on my James Spader impression

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.540
and I would love to try it out if I could.

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.260
I mean, we can go Amp versus Amp, Spader versus Spader

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:31.020
and Justin can be in it.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:31.740
Oh, that'd be great.

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.780
One issue is I don't know who that is.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.060
Oh, James Spader?

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.460
Yeah, so my impression will be based

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.380
largely off of whatever you do, Travis.

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.460
Okay, let me zoom in.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.860
Wait, you don't know who James Spader is?

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.980
I know the name.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:51.260
Is that Cyclops?

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.380
No, Boston Legal?

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.460
No, James Hay-

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.980
Okay, you're thinking of James Marsden.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.060
Okay, this does get confusing.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.900
Okay, let's talk about it real quick.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.460
Okay.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.700
James Marster's foot guy.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:06.300
James Marsden, Sonic's friend.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.420
And maybe potential foot guy.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.140
We cannot confirm or deny.

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:17.900
James Harden, famously bearded basketball player.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.260
It gets confusing.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.100
James Spader, none of those three.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.140
None of those.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.300
Okay, this gives me a lot to go on.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.900
Weird boss on The Office.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.380
He was-

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.500
Don't tell me who it is.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.660
Okay, that's the deal.

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.380
Either you take it or you leave it.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.300
Then let me try it now.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.340
Okay, okay.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.740
I said, I'm the weird boss on this show.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.740
I don't know which one.

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:44.860
And you're gonna listen to me now, James Spader.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:48.220
Okay, now tell them I'm gonna put you on my blacklist.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.020
I'm gonna put you-

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.060
Oh, is that who it is?

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:50.460
Yeah.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.100
Oh, okay.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.300
God, I love blacklists.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:53.680
Clearly.

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:58.460
Now, now, now I'm gonna put you on my blacklist.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.020
You gotta-

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.980
You're like, you have Kareen in the Goldblum.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.860
You're right, you're right, you're right.

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.580
It's surprisingly close.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:05.820
Yeah.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.260
Is it surprisingly close?

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.540
Yeah, there's a thin barrier between Spader and Goldblum.

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.140
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:13.420
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.900
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:45.660
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:55.660
Kiss your dad square on the lips.
