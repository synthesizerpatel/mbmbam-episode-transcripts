00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.080
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me Advice Show.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.280
I don't want a lot this Christmas. There is just one thing I need.

00:53.280 --> 00:59.600
I don't need a lot of presents underneath the Christmas tree.

00:59.600 --> 01:14.960
All I want for Christmas is you.

01:14.960 --> 01:19.440
Wow, that's fucking moist, Juice! Damn, I've heard other people make that

01:19.440 --> 01:23.040
noise before. I've never heard anybody put that much wet on the mix.

01:23.840 --> 01:24.560
Damn.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.760
And listen, if you're doing a water drop sound effect, the least you can do is get it moist.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.880
That sounded like a bucket drops from a great height of water.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.240
Let me get one isolated in case people need a new text message noise.

01:38.080 --> 01:42.240
Damn! Fuck! That's a fucking deep cave, dawg!

01:42.240 --> 01:46.240
Yeah, that's a deep, deep cave. Your mouth is the fucking cave of secrets from all that.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.520
Yeah, it's a deep cave where all my family's money comes from.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.640
It's a deep cave that puts food on my children's backs.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.440
Yeah, full of treasure, just like the cave of secrets from Aladdin.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.120
Trav, did you have somewhere you wanted to go with that?

01:57.680 --> 01:59.040
Yeah, we're ramping it up.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.200
Oh, we on that Christmas creep?

02:01.200 --> 02:03.120
Yeah, I'm starting it today.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.720
Today, huh? You couldn't even give us the damn decency of waiting until,

02:07.280 --> 02:09.200
you know, Friday morning?

02:09.200 --> 02:13.680
Today. He's late, honestly. The Christmas season starts November 9th,

02:15.440 --> 02:21.360
the day after Travis and Mai's birthday, because we don't want to obscure the big holiday.

02:21.360 --> 02:28.880
But that, Justin, I would say November 9th to November 23rd, that was but preamble.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.160
Oh, here he goes on that voice again.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.120
Today begins the Christmas creep.

02:31.120 --> 02:39.360
We need a fucking quarter, a swear jar for weird Dickensian sort of fancy lab Travis.

02:39.360 --> 02:46.160
Start soaking your puddings, wrap your trinkets in tinsel and shiny paper.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.440
Is it the riddle master that has sort of take, is Travis more of a riddle?

02:49.440 --> 02:53.040
I'm his brother, Ebenezer Christmas.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.760
Ebenezer Christmas, like from the great book?

02:56.560 --> 02:57.680
Ebenezer Christmas is Wonderful Journey.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.120
No, he's my cousin.

02:59.120 --> 02:59.360
Right.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.120
Ebenezer Scrooge, he's my cousin. Ebenezer is our family name.

03:05.120 --> 03:09.360
Right. So did you get ghosts too, or did he just tell you about his ghost and you're like,

03:09.360 --> 03:10.720
oh, that sounds cool, Abe?

03:10.720 --> 03:12.640
I got skeletons.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.880
Whoa, you got Christmas skeletons?

03:14.880 --> 03:16.560
Yeah, it was way cooler, dude.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.760
Yeah, did they try to teach you a-

03:17.760 --> 03:19.600
It's fucking rude.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.040
Oh, and you cuss.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.440
Oh yeah, fuck I do. Christmas fucking rude.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.040
So what did these skeletons have for you?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.120
They taught me how to skateboard.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.280
Wow, these sound like pretty cool.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.160
Hey, what year do you occupy?

03:34.960 --> 03:36.880
I occupied 1993.

03:38.240 --> 03:42.720
So, but you're cousins with Ebenezer Scrooge?

03:42.720 --> 03:43.200
Correct.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.240
I'm not sure that that works, bud.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.080
Distant cousins.

03:48.080 --> 03:48.800
Through time?

03:49.440 --> 03:50.160
Yes.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.120
Does it work?

03:51.120 --> 03:51.920
Time cousins?

03:52.480 --> 03:53.840
I'm not sure time cousins is the one we-

03:53.840 --> 03:54.800
Okay, how many-

03:54.800 --> 03:57.200
His dad married my aunt.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.040
Okay.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.240
And then died a hundred years ago.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.520
Yes.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.640
But the aunt stayed alive.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.600
Okay, time cousins.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.800
Hey, how many skeletons were there?

04:06.800 --> 04:08.000
I want to hear this story.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.360
There were 16.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.680
Wow, how long did that take?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.640
Took a long time, if I'm being honest.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.400
One of them taught me to ollie.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.840
One of them taught me to kickflip.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.240
So it was all steps.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.320
One of them taught me to do that thing

04:20.320 --> 04:24.400
where like you jump up and it goes on a rail

04:24.400 --> 04:25.920
and you ride that for a while.

04:25.920 --> 04:26.320
A grind?

04:26.320 --> 04:26.800
I did that one.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.240
A grind?

04:28.240 --> 04:31.120
Yes, one of the one of the skeletons taught me to grind.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.800
One of the skeletons taught me to do a Christ 360.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.280
Wow, so the skeletons know about,

04:37.280 --> 04:39.120
and this proves my theory that the skeletons

04:39.120 --> 04:41.520
do know about Christ and his cool works.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.280
Oh yes, absolutely.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.840
One of them came straight from heaven,

04:45.840 --> 04:47.680
was one of those heaven skeletons.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.080
Heaven skeletons are like, he left me behind.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.760
Yeah, uh-huh.

04:51.760 --> 04:57.680
So these skeletons, was it like Bob Burnquist was one of them

04:57.680 --> 04:58.640
and Bucky Lacek?

04:59.680 --> 04:59.920
Yes.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.000
Andrew Reynolds, are these the skeletons,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.600
or were they just sort of unnamed punk skeletons?

05:07.600 --> 05:09.840
One of them was Tony Hawk's old skeleton.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.880
Oh, before he got it replaced with, yeah, sure.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.160
Right, yeah.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.560
Yeah, if memory serves, he did a skeleton swap

05:16.560 --> 05:19.040
with Bam Margera, but Bam's didn't quite fit.

05:19.760 --> 05:24.000
And so it was just a bonus, a bonus, bonus bones.

05:24.000 --> 05:24.880
Bonus bones.

05:24.880 --> 05:25.680
Yes, correct.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.520
All right, well, there's probably nowhere else

05:27.520 --> 05:30.000
for this story or character to go.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.520
Well, then Tony Hawk's old skeleton and I fell in love.

05:33.520 --> 05:33.840
Okay.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.920
Oh, okay, now I'm back in.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.600
I was losing interest, but now I'm very much in.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.040
We dated for three years, then we moved in together,

05:43.040 --> 05:44.720
but that only lasted nine months.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.120
Before we decided we'd be better off as friends

05:47.920 --> 05:49.520
and occasional lovers.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.000
Oh, so you still fuck.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.640
Thank you, something for the fans.

05:52.640 --> 05:59.440
We still fuck, but we don't live together,

05:59.440 --> 06:01.040
we don't cohabitate anymore.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.120
That's fine, it's 2020, nobody lives together,

06:03.120 --> 06:06.720
but do you explain a little bit sort of like in detail

06:06.720 --> 06:09.760
of what that looks like if this lover is-

06:09.760 --> 06:11.680
There's one fucking skeleton, my dude,

06:11.680 --> 06:12.880
the options are endless.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.080
I guess it's mostly vacuous space.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.520
I prefer kneecap.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.760
Okay, that's actually the one that you can't.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.320
I think you actually picked the only one that can't.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.960
You don't know what my genitals are like.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.880
That's true, he probably got those old English jinnies.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.560
That's right, the original issue.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.520
Old English jinnies, those juice,

06:35.520 --> 06:39.600
I don't know if you know, those were a wild, wild scenario.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.040
Anyway, this is our Christmas episode.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.840
Not our Candle Nights episode, that one's later.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.240
This one we're giving straight up to Christmas,

06:51.120 --> 06:57.360
every 10 years we like to break one off for Jesus' birthday.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.440
Yeah, for Tiny Jesus.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.240
Yeah, the little one.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.520
Yeah, so do we wanna,

07:05.520 --> 07:08.800
I feel like I shouldn't be leading the wagon,

07:08.800 --> 07:11.360
but I feel like I am, and that's not usually my role,

07:11.360 --> 07:14.240
so I'm gonna step on back behind the curtain and let Justin-

07:14.240 --> 07:17.600
I recently made potato soup and shared some with my neighbor.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.440
I put it in a large mason jar and delivered it to her.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.320
She ate the soup, and then a few days later called to tell me

07:26.320 --> 07:28.160
she put the jar in my mailbox.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.480
I was heading to work and didn't check the mailbox.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.320
And then, long story short, I didn't remember

07:32.320 --> 07:33.840
to check the jar until two days later.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.520
It wasn't there, but there was mail.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.160
Did the mail carrier steal my mason jar?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.960
And should I leave a note asking for it back?

07:44.960 --> 07:47.280
That's from Post Perloin in Pennsylvania.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.120
Wow, okay, so if you lived in Texas, this wouldn't be a thing,

07:51.120 --> 07:54.160
because literally, if I stretch both my arms out

07:54.160 --> 07:56.800
and spin in a 360 degree circle,

07:56.800 --> 08:00.880
I'm gonna knock six to seven mason jars off of surfaces

08:01.600 --> 08:02.240
in my house.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.960
The postal service-

08:04.960 --> 08:07.040
Wait, where did they come from, Griffin?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.680
Just from living in Texas.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.440
Over here, I'm brewing some sarsaparilla pickles,

08:14.000 --> 08:18.080
and over there, these three were for all my morning juices

08:18.080 --> 08:20.640
that I drink and secrete.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.560
This one over here, I just like.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.160
This is my lucky jar.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.480
I try to keep this one on me at all times.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.040
And this one here has got a bug trapped under it.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.040
Well, you can't get rid of that one,

08:33.040 --> 08:34.080
or the bug will be free.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.760
I want to step outside the bit real quick

08:35.760 --> 08:37.040
and do a quick derailment.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.760
This morning, a big fucking lizard got in my house.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.200
Not one of these cute little guys where you're like,

08:41.200 --> 08:43.280
oh, like you're walking down the stairs at night,

08:43.280 --> 08:44.240
and you're like, oh, look at that,

08:44.240 --> 08:45.520
it's a little tiny lizard.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.320
This was a fucking size of my hand-ass lizard.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.360
This is a big boy.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.000
A real lizard?

08:50.000 --> 08:50.480
A real lizard.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.160
Did it have one of those angry faces,

08:52.160 --> 08:54.320
where it's like, this is a lizard that kills things.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.880
He didn't seem, oh no, he wasn't angry or anything like that,

08:56.880 --> 08:59.440
but he did move fast and unpredictably,

08:59.440 --> 09:02.240
which is the worst kind of way that a lizard can move

09:02.240 --> 09:03.920
when I'm interfacing with it.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.960
But I took care of it.

09:08.960 --> 09:09.840
Tell me how.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.840
And that's all I'm gonna say.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.920
No, Griffin, you actually can't do that.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.520
And that's all I'm gonna say.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.720
When you say you took care of it,

09:16.720 --> 09:19.280
did you mean you kind of maybe yelped a little bit

09:19.280 --> 09:21.040
and it went somewhere and you didn't see where it went

09:21.040 --> 09:22.800
and you're choosing to pretend like-

09:22.800 --> 09:24.640
It's a Schrodinger's lizard at this point.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.760
Is it in my house still?

09:25.760 --> 09:26.960
Is it not in my house still?

09:26.960 --> 09:27.520
I don't know.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.200
It was there and then it scurried

09:29.200 --> 09:30.480
and then it wasn't there anymore.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.920
I've done that move with spiders.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.360
Everyone in my home that isn't me is very afraid of spiders.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.320
And they're always like,

09:40.320 --> 09:42.480
get over here, you big burly man,

09:42.480 --> 09:44.640
and execute this fucking bug.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.400
And I'm like, I'm not gonna kill a spider

09:46.400 --> 09:47.520
that's very bad.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.360
It seems bad juju.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.240
I don't wanna do it.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.520
It seems like bad luck.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.240
I don't wanna.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.440
So I'm not gonna kill a spider.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.520
So I'll shepherd them into a thing.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.520
And sometimes when you're trying the passive route

09:57.520 --> 10:02.960
with a spider, it's gonna get away.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.240
But a lot of times I'll just fake,

10:04.240 --> 10:06.560
like just pretend like, no, no, no, I got him.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.360
I got him, I got him, I got him.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.360
Last I saw my lizard friend,

10:11.360 --> 10:13.040
he was close to the front door.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.400
So I'm just gonna guess.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.880
I do like the fake balled up paper towel.

10:16.880 --> 10:17.920
Like, oh no, he's in here.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.120
I gotta hurry, open the door.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:20.480
That's a good one.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.360
He's definitely in here.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.000
That's a good one.

10:22.000 --> 10:22.800
I like that one.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.880
So the postal service worker

10:24.880 --> 10:25.920
probably didn't steal your mason jar.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.480
Nobody wants an old soupy mason jar.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.520
Really Trav?

10:29.520 --> 10:29.920
Really?

10:29.920 --> 10:30.960
Here's the thing though.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.880
After the year that they've had,

10:32.880 --> 10:35.040
you wanna put, no, no, no, no, okay.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.960
I am not going to say they stole it.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.240
I'm going to say they took it.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.680
And here's why I'm going to say that.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.280
And here's why I'm changing the wording.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.640
Because there was a stamp on it.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.160
Because there was a stamp on it.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.400
No, you left it in there for three days.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.680
A mason jar ain't small.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.560
I don't know how big this mailbox is,

10:50.560 --> 10:52.240
but it's definitely not big enough

10:52.240 --> 10:54.240
that a mason jar went unnoticed

10:54.240 --> 10:56.560
for it seems like upwards of two

10:56.560 --> 10:58.240
to maybe two and a half days.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.520
So there were at least two checks,

10:59.520 --> 11:01.360
maybe three where this mail carrier

11:01.360 --> 11:02.720
probably by the third one said,

11:03.840 --> 11:06.080
I guess this has to be mail.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.120
It's gotta be mail.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.080
It must be mail.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.040
Why aren't they getting it?

11:09.760 --> 11:11.680
They put this in here.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.640
It's not like when somebody puts a two liter bottle

11:14.640 --> 11:17.840
in their toilet to use less water.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.320
This isn't so I put less mail in the box.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.760
I have to take it and they took it.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.360
Here's the thing, folks.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.600
And I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you

11:27.600 --> 11:28.960
if you don't know about mail law,

11:29.600 --> 11:33.840
but the mailbox is not your house.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.440
The mailbox is the mail carrier's house.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.520
That's their little house, okay?

11:39.520 --> 11:41.200
You put letters into their house,

11:41.200 --> 11:42.560
they take letters out because they're like,

11:42.560 --> 11:43.760
who left letters in my house?

11:44.400 --> 11:47.520
They'll put letters for you into their house.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.760
It's still their house.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.800
You don't decide to put decorations on the inside of it.

11:52.800 --> 11:57.120
You don't try to spruce it up with various lacquers.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.400
You can do that on the outside.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.120
On the outside, you do whatever you want.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.640
On the inside, they can put up a fucking poster

12:04.640 --> 12:06.480
of Pamela Anderson from Baywatch.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.840
They can do whatever they want.

12:07.840 --> 12:08.400
And they will.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.840
They can personalize it, kid it out,

12:09.840 --> 12:12.240
put some Shaq Carpenter, a little disco ball in there.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.840
It's not your fucking business.

12:13.840 --> 12:14.960
That's their house.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.160
There's not a lot of examples of this.

12:18.160 --> 12:22.000
We don't do milk delivery people anymore.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.640
I can't think of another airlock of possession

12:25.600 --> 12:27.200
like a mailbox is where it's like,

12:27.200 --> 12:28.960
I'm gonna put this in here.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.560
And while it's in there, it is both mine and yours

12:32.560 --> 12:33.920
until you remove it.

12:34.800 --> 12:39.680
The mail carrier could store crack cocaine in the mailbox.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.160
They could put it in there for them

12:42.160 --> 12:45.040
and have someone else come trade it for money.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.520
And you're like, did you do this from my mailbox?

12:47.520 --> 12:48.560
And they'll have to crack you back.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.840
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.240
That's my property on the inside.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.680
It's none of your fucking business

12:53.680 --> 12:54.960
what I do with your mailbox.

12:54.960 --> 12:55.920
I do whatever I want.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.960
You're lucky I take your letters to other people.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.560
I could just throw them in the trash.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.840
I don't think I could do that, actually.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.040
That would be a violation of federal law,

13:03.040 --> 13:04.800
but it's their house.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.600
They can do whatever they want.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.840
And you left a big, stinky jar in there.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.120
If you come to my house

13:09.840 --> 13:12.240
and you leave a big, stinky potato jar on the floor,

13:12.240 --> 13:13.680
I'm gonna throw it away.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.800
It's my house.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.600
Oh, that's another option is that mail called garbage

13:18.160 --> 13:20.240
and said, hey garbage, it's me, mail.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.120
Just wanna let you know

13:21.680 --> 13:24.160
they hid a little bit of garbage from you

13:24.160 --> 13:27.680
in my mail house in the box I call,

13:27.680 --> 13:30.720
in my little dead drop that is their mailbox.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.200
And now I'm worried that they put some of their letters

13:33.200 --> 13:34.240
into a trash can.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.600
If you put an unmailed letter into your garbage

13:38.640 --> 13:41.120
and the garbage guys took it away,

13:41.120 --> 13:44.320
there's no one who'd be like, how dare you?

13:44.320 --> 13:48.960
That was mail, not garbage, clearly.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.480
That's why you can't throw a toilet away.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.880
Garbage calls plumbing.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.280
It says, hey, they did it again.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.680
These guys are trying to chop and screw their services.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.480
And I don't like it.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.000
Do you guys want Yahoo?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.280
Yes, please.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.520
I think this one's so wild

14:05.520 --> 14:08.400
and I deliberated to not bring it,

14:08.400 --> 14:11.440
but then I am because it is part

14:11.440 --> 14:14.400
of what could be a new segment called,

14:15.440 --> 14:18.640
hey Yahoo, are you guys okay?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.880
That is a wild thing to hear you say

14:20.880 --> 14:25.280
after 535 episodes, it's terrifying to me.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.720
My butthole clenched hearing you say this is a wild one.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.080
This is a wild one.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.240
So the question, it was sent in by a couple people.

14:34.240 --> 14:39.600
It's from a Yahoo Answers user, skatermomof5,

14:39.600 --> 14:42.240
which absolutely fucking rips.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.360
And skatermomof5 asks,

14:47.360 --> 14:49.840
what do we really know about Mrs. Claus?

14:51.200 --> 14:51.520
Huh.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.880
Y'all, there are 33 answers on this one,

14:54.880 --> 14:56.640
which is a lot for Yahoo.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.360
And they, first of all,

14:59.360 --> 15:02.560
anytime you write the word Santa on Yahoo,

15:02.560 --> 15:05.680
it changes the colors to make it red and green,

15:05.680 --> 15:08.960
which seems unnecessary, like completely unnecessary.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.480
But the answers that literally 100%

15:13.360 --> 15:15.680
of the people who have answered this question have submitted

15:16.240 --> 15:21.920
are absolutely fucking batshit wild outer space

15:22.560 --> 15:27.440
fucking Gadzooks Looney Tunes out there wild man shit.

15:27.440 --> 15:32.000
And I'm just going to break you off a few pieces.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.560
Please.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.320
For all the cartoons and stories and rumors,

15:34.320 --> 15:36.080
we really don't know much about Mrs. Claus.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.040
Rumors?

15:37.040 --> 15:39.040
Yeah, you know, the Santa Claus rumors.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.160
We really don't know much about Mrs. Claus.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.840
I do know that she exists since when I talk to Santa

15:45.840 --> 15:46.640
and I ask her how she is,

15:46.640 --> 15:49.360
he usually says that she's well and sends her good wishes.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.920
It's a cool way to start out.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.120
It's a cool way to start out.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.720
Well, I know that Santa's the center of-

15:54.720 --> 15:55.840
Just a side note, Griffin,

15:55.840 --> 15:57.600
just a side note, Griffin, the way you phrase that,

15:57.600 --> 15:59.200
the way that the person has phrased this

15:59.200 --> 16:02.640
does make it sound like Santa might have killed Mrs. Claus

16:02.640 --> 16:03.680
and is covering that up.

16:03.680 --> 16:04.480
How's Mrs. Claus?

16:04.480 --> 16:05.280
Oh, she's fine.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.560
She's very, very good.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.800
She's fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.040
She's just, oh, she's so busy right now.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.200
She can't come to the phone.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.200
Boy, there sure are a lot of places

16:15.200 --> 16:17.120
to bury somebody on the North Pole, huh?

16:17.120 --> 16:17.440
Right.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.960
They would never catch him.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.560
That's why he keeps the reindeers.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.120
The reindeers, they'll eat whenever you feed them.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.440
Yeah, here's another one, just literally the next one.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.520
Well, I know that Santa's the center of my everything

16:31.520 --> 16:34.560
and he really does love cookies and milk and even hot cocoa.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.480
The elves sometimes love to tease him.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.640
As for me, I love to bake and help out in the workshop

16:38.640 --> 16:40.400
and my main job is cooking and cleaning

16:40.400 --> 16:41.600
and picking up and doing laundry.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.320
Okay, so they are interesting.

16:44.320 --> 16:47.120
They are inhabiting Mrs. Claus in this one.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.400
There are no quotation marks.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.520
With all the little ones around here,

16:49.520 --> 16:50.640
I have a full-time job too.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.040
I must care for the animals and take them to appointments.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.760
So the reindeers get sick?

16:55.760 --> 16:57.120
The reindeers get sick?

16:57.120 --> 16:59.520
I think the little ones are the elves.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.920
The animals get sick and I have to take them to appointments

17:01.920 --> 17:04.960
and when the elves have soccer games or school or work,

17:04.960 --> 17:06.080
I help them with that too.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.680
Bedtime, Santa and I both try to do together.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.360
Bedtime stories are a must at our house.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.760
We often go over the naughty and nice list together before bed

17:13.760 --> 17:15.440
and then we read our Bible,

17:15.440 --> 17:17.040
check in on the elves and animals.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.400
And we kiss each other goodnight

17:18.400 --> 17:20.400
and I set the cocoa machine before bed

17:20.400 --> 17:22.560
and we sleep in and in the morning.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.160
And then in the morning, we fuck.

17:24.880 --> 17:28.720
And we fuck like fucking wild dogs.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.800
I don't like this idea of Santa Claus

17:30.800 --> 17:32.240
as a follower of Christ.

17:32.240 --> 17:32.740
Okay.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.800
Because for me, I don't understand a Christian who's like,

17:38.320 --> 17:40.400
I'm gonna make this kid's birthday all about me.

17:40.400 --> 17:40.880
Right.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.720
Because that's what he did, you know what I mean?

17:42.720 --> 17:44.080
I want to make this one about me.

17:44.080 --> 17:47.280
Santa really took that one away from old Jesus, didn't he?

17:47.280 --> 17:49.280
Yeah, he did.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.760
I don't see Jesus on Coke cans, all right?

17:51.760 --> 17:57.600
Just like the Energizer Bunny took over Easter.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.160
Yeah.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.600
Jesus help one out, okay?

17:59.600 --> 18:00.320
Cadbury Bunny.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.080
When fucking Bart Simpson took Easter

18:02.080 --> 18:04.160
with all of his great Butterfinger commercials.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.160
Here's another one, literally the next one.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.720
Mrs. Claus used to be invented to assuage matters

18:08.720 --> 18:10.080
over Santa's loneliness.

18:10.720 --> 18:11.760
All right, all right, all right.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.000
Children normally requested if Santa had a spouse and youngsters,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.040
so if you shrewd creator or advertiser, determine sure.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.920
However, they just have the youngsters of the sector

18:21.920 --> 18:23.840
to like and none in their possess.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.840
So like, if I'm reading this correctly,

18:27.840 --> 18:29.840
that Mrs. Claus was invented

18:29.840 --> 18:31.440
because kids would come up to Santa and be like,

18:31.440 --> 18:34.960
damn, Santa, are you getting some though, dog?

18:35.920 --> 18:38.320
You getting some up there, up in the pole?

18:38.320 --> 18:40.800
You getting the pole up in the pole, Santa?

18:43.360 --> 18:44.560
Probably not.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.960
Originally, the answer when he got asked that was,

18:46.960 --> 18:49.920
he would just say, I've got ho, ho, hos in different area codes.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.160
Travis, it's funny that you say that.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.200
Just a few more down.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.960
I heard that she's married to a ho, ho, ho,

18:56.960 --> 18:59.200
AKA Santa, old Saint Nick, Kris Kringle.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.240
You're getting coal in your stocking for blabbing, M.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.440
Shame on you.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.040
Don't know what none of that does or means it.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.320
Here's one, that she is married to Santa Claus.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.120
In, out.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.520
Bing, bang, boom.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.320
And we're done.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.200
But is that the only thing you know about her?

19:17.200 --> 19:18.320
Shame on you, sir.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.280
Shame on you.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.760
You didn't know this one from an anonymous user.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.960
She sits while her husband,

19:22.960 --> 19:24.480
Santa and his elves do all the work.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.440
She also can't have kids unless Santa's sperm is bad.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.480
Killer.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.960
She is probably sitting at home getting visits

19:32.960 --> 19:34.240
from a tiger woods.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.480
She's the driving force behind the legend of Santa Claus.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.680
I like that one.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.720
I like that one too.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.600
I like the strong woman behind the man angle.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.400
I love that one.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.640
She was bitten three nights ago by me.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.880
Her name is now Mrs. Claustrophobic

19:52.880 --> 19:55.040
because she's trapped in my cellar.

19:55.040 --> 19:55.760
Yahoo!

19:55.760 --> 19:57.680
Hey, it's me, Griffin.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.200
Hey, I see you're trapped down there

19:59.200 --> 20:01.200
in that big, big, deep hole.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.400
I got a rope here.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.440
Do you need help?

20:03.440 --> 20:04.480
I can pull you out.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.520
So just, I'm confused by that.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.280
They bit Mrs. Claus

20:09.280 --> 20:11.280
and that led her to being trapped in the basement

20:11.280 --> 20:12.400
or is there a step in there?

20:12.400 --> 20:15.440
They got bit and then that means they get to keep them all.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.880
Next one, Lone Wolf.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.640
Santa always wears a cup.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.440
Not the question, but thank you very much.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.680
I feel like that person pulled up a convertible like,

20:29.680 --> 20:34.240
hey, I'd like to throw my fucking thing in here.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.920
If we got time, Santa always wears a cup.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.200
George, we know you mention it anytime we talk about

20:41.200 --> 20:43.200
literally anything.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.880
Fucking back to back.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.520
She's all warm, rosy cheeked, joyful

20:47.520 --> 20:48.720
with a merry laugh and sweet.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.480
This is the only answer of these 33

20:50.480 --> 20:53.520
that got a thumbs down reaction from somebody.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.400
Literally next.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.560
You're not buying into the fiction enough.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.520
Literally next.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.920
She likes to stay close to the pole.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.420
Hussie!

21:01.280 --> 21:01.780
Yahoo!

21:03.280 --> 21:05.520
I wish I could put a website in timeout.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.880
Can I fucking call, I guess, Elon?

21:08.880 --> 21:10.000
Like, I don't want to,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.240
but is there anybody who can put a website in timeout?

21:13.120 --> 21:13.620
Santa?

21:14.960 --> 21:15.600
That's the thing.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.240
This is going to get back to old Chris Kringle

21:18.240 --> 21:20.480
and he's going to be like, what did you say about my wife?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.080
Or ultimately he's going to be like,

21:22.640 --> 21:24.640
honey, is there something you need to tell me?

21:25.280 --> 21:27.440
A few of the people on this said that they have

21:28.160 --> 21:30.400
had sexual Congress with you,

21:30.400 --> 21:33.600
which seems unlikely, but I have to inquire.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.640
Well, Christmas is canceled this year

21:36.640 --> 21:40.720
because me and the missus need to go do couples counseling.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.280
She porked someone and got locked in their basement.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.720
Missed Christmas,

21:44.720 --> 21:47.360
and we were supposed to read the Bible tonight.

21:49.360 --> 21:53.360
To the man who has my wife locked in his basement,

21:53.360 --> 21:55.680
I have a particular set of skills.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.520
If it was five answers and all of them were this wild,

21:59.520 --> 22:00.800
that'd be one thing.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.320
If there were 15 answers and a couple of them were this wild,

22:04.320 --> 22:05.600
it would be one thing.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.120
This is 33 answers,

22:07.920 --> 22:10.880
which with very few exceptions are just like,

22:12.000 --> 22:17.040
yeah, I heard her and the headless horseman fucked

22:17.040 --> 22:19.360
and Santa's got old jizz.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.280
He's got broken jingle balls.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.960
He's got broken jingle balls

22:24.960 --> 22:29.520
and I heard that she likes to huff reindeer shit to get high.

22:29.520 --> 22:35.600
And meanwhile, Yahoo's like, we made the words red and green.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.720
It's festive.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.400
Is this like a special sub-Yahoo?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.520
I don't know if those exist,

22:41.520 --> 22:45.440
but is there like a layer on this

22:45.440 --> 22:50.320
where it's like sort of an RP Yahoo answers

22:50.320 --> 22:52.400
where you can like really inhabit the world?

22:52.400 --> 22:53.840
I do not believe so.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.640
I think it's just the regular ass busted up fucking

22:56.640 --> 23:00.000
Yahoo answers website that nobody wants,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.480
nobody will pay for, invest in.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.880
This money, this website is burning money.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.560
I do not understand how it's still out.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.320
I'm grateful for it because of the capital C content,

23:10.320 --> 23:11.840
but what the fuck else?

23:12.480 --> 23:14.400
Like we couldn't make Quibi work,

23:14.400 --> 23:19.360
but fucking Yahoo answers is financially soluble?

23:19.360 --> 23:24.320
Cram have moved on to other, to greener pastures.

23:24.320 --> 23:28.160
It's an abandoned building with like Russian teens

23:28.160 --> 23:31.680
doing toilet cocaine in the busted up bathroom.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.360
It's ruined, it's gone.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.400
It's beyond repair.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.400
This is what is left here on Yahoo answers.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.280
I'll buy it.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.600
Let's fucking buy it.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.600
This would be an incredible investment.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.760
And what a turnaround, what a story.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.640
If it's like, oh, do you remember how 11 years ago

23:48.640 --> 23:53.280
we started and we included some weird, silly questions?

23:53.280 --> 23:56.560
Now we own those questions, we built them back.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.840
This is our sea biscuit.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.720
How about another question?

24:01.600 --> 24:02.320
Yeah, I'd love that.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.600
Here it comes.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.560
I work in the cheese shop of a liquor store

24:08.560 --> 24:10.240
and I'm pretty new to the job.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.720
Because of this, I'll often butcher pieces of cheese

24:12.720 --> 24:13.440
to the point where you can't sell them.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.800
You're already doing it bad.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.480
Yeah, you shouldn't butcher the cheese.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.920
That's for me only.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.600
My manager tells me to throw them away,

24:21.600 --> 24:23.120
but I always feel like that's such a waste.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.960
I would love to take them home with me.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.640
How do I casually bring this up to ask

24:26.640 --> 24:29.040
if I could take the cheese preferably for free

24:29.040 --> 24:30.560
or should I just take it anyway?

24:30.560 --> 24:32.800
Please help, that's from please help me steal this cheese.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.560
Ooh, that's a slippery slope.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.320
Oh boy, that's rough.

24:36.320 --> 24:40.160
Well, we need to, obviously, here's a joke.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.960
You don't butcher the cheese, you cut it to cheese

24:42.960 --> 24:44.880
and that's very fucking funny.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.640
But for real though, what verb are we doing?

24:48.640 --> 24:52.320
Do we mong, do you mong, mong the cheese?

24:52.320 --> 24:53.200
You mong or the cheese?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.400
You mong it, mong the cheese.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.560
Monging is selling, mongering,

24:56.560 --> 24:58.800
mongering is the selling of it.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.600
Yeah.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.720
I believe carving is what an artist does.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.080
Slice, slicing.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.520
No, Justin, fuck you.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.040
Everyone slices their cheese at home.

25:07.040 --> 25:07.360
Oh.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.960
I'm carving the cheese.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.960
I'm opening the slice of cheese.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.120
This is artisanal.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.280
I'm unwrapping the slice of cheese.

25:15.280 --> 25:15.760
No.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.400
For the sandwich I'm making.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.320
I'm blooming the cheese.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.120
Today we're letting the cheese bloom.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.360
Today I'm gonna throw this big block of cheese

25:25.360 --> 25:27.360
up on that light bulb in my ceiling fan.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.600
I'm gonna smush the cheese.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.400
I'm gonna smush it.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.680
That's what you could tell your boss.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.360
I didn't mess it up, I was blooming the cheese.

25:33.360 --> 25:33.920
I was blooming it.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.600
Oh, you don't bloom here.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.720
I don't bloom cheese here.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.560
It's all the thing at the pâtisserie.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.640
I used to work at in Farrell.

25:42.080 --> 25:42.960
In Farrell.

25:42.960 --> 25:48.240
Me and Farrell used to work in France at the pâtisserie.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.800
He would chop up all of the cheese

25:50.800 --> 25:52.800
bad into little unsellable chunks

25:52.800 --> 25:54.640
and we would make nachos.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.880
His strange large hat is the main from cheese

26:00.160 --> 26:03.760
that I sliced, or rather butchered, myself.

26:03.760 --> 26:04.480
Oh, you.

26:06.480 --> 26:09.600
I go through the trouble of going to a place

26:09.600 --> 26:11.760
that specifically sells cheese,

26:11.760 --> 26:13.840
even if it is inside a liquor store,

26:14.480 --> 26:17.200
you better put on a fake French accent for a reason.

26:17.200 --> 26:17.760
That's fair.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.240
Okay, here's the problem with this.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.680
You accidentally cut cheese bad.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.480
And you're like, I could take this out, great.

26:27.360 --> 26:32.400
But how does your boss know you accidentally cut the cheese bad

26:32.400 --> 26:33.920
if you're like, I could just take it.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.560
But then again, just throwing it away, is that better?

26:38.560 --> 26:40.960
I think you take it without a word.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.480
You can have your cheese and eat it too here if you do.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.880
This is an honest mistake, right?

26:46.880 --> 26:48.560
I believe in you.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.640
We don't have any stealers or sinners

26:50.640 --> 26:52.880
or thieves who listen to our shit.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.160
Real Mrs. Clauses.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.720
Real Mrs. Clauses if you know what Travis is saying.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.800
So you can make this work for you.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.960
Innocent crime, let me take home the scrapple.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.320
Don't just throw it away.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.680
But what you do have to do to get rid of

27:07.680 --> 27:10.080
any appearance of impropriety

27:10.080 --> 27:13.360
is every time you do fuck this cheese up

27:13.360 --> 27:17.280
with your clumsy oaf hands, is you gotta go, uh-oh.

27:19.200 --> 27:22.160
Every single time so that your boss does know

27:22.160 --> 27:24.640
that mistakes and whoopsies have been done.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.960
Yeah, and I think the more it draws attention

27:28.960 --> 27:31.280
to your mistake, the more your boss will be like,

27:31.280 --> 27:33.200
they are definitely not doing this on purpose

27:33.200 --> 27:36.560
because no human being would repeat the thing

27:36.560 --> 27:40.800
that they're doing just for a free morsel of cheese

27:40.800 --> 27:43.200
like some kind of Dickensian mouse.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.320
Yeah, like fucking Monterey Jack from the Rescue Rangers.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.360
Correct.

27:47.360 --> 27:52.480
Now, I am now thinking about being at a cheese platter

27:53.680 --> 27:58.000
and looking at all of their impressive hunks

27:58.000 --> 27:59.680
that they've got and trying to think about

27:59.680 --> 28:03.920
what's gonna go best for my big adult party

28:03.920 --> 28:05.360
I'm having that night.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.360
And I go to the cheesemonger and I say,

28:07.360 --> 28:09.760
I'm looking for something that's gonna pair well

28:09.760 --> 28:12.480
with a very oaky scotch.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.520
And I was wondering if you,

28:13.520 --> 28:15.760
and then I hear from the back room, uh-oh.

28:18.960 --> 28:23.040
I'm probably, I might take my business.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.720
I don't know what I would do in that scenario.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.000
Yeah, but what if you're at one of the finest

28:28.000 --> 28:32.800
fromagelies in the nation of France.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.360
Yes, and they said, and you hear from the back,

28:35.360 --> 28:37.440
that you hear, le, uh-oh.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.640
That's, yeah.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.440
Zut-a-lore.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.200
Is that a letter?

28:41.200 --> 28:42.240
Zut-a-lore.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.880
Zut-a-lore, I fucked it up again.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.480
Sacre bleu, I fucked it up.

28:50.480 --> 28:50.980
Oh.

28:52.560 --> 28:57.040
Sacre bleu cheese, I fucked, is all over the floor.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.480
Hey boss, I did it again.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.760
I dropped it on the floor.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.040
Oh ratatouille.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.000
Really?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.920
You told me not to cut it in my hand

29:03.920 --> 29:05.760
and I held it in my hand and I cut it

29:05.760 --> 29:07.200
and I got blood on the dang thing.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.600
That is the thing, if I hear, oh no,

29:09.600 --> 29:14.320
in any location where cutting is 50% of the job or more,

29:14.320 --> 29:17.520
I assume someone has just been mutilated.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.280
A slicer cut has happened.

29:19.280 --> 29:22.880
Although, damn, it would be a power move though

29:22.880 --> 29:24.880
for if the boss came back and was like,

29:24.880 --> 29:26.640
what did you do to this cheese?

29:26.640 --> 29:28.720
You can just be like, don't blame me,

29:28.720 --> 29:30.320
blame my ratatouille.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.360
And you lift up your hat.

29:31.360 --> 29:32.640
My ratatouille did it.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.880
And he's like, oh, you're doing a ratatouille?

29:34.880 --> 29:36.480
And you say, yeah, sorry.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.720
He says, no, and he lifts up his hat.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.120
I've been doing a ratatouille too.

29:41.120 --> 29:41.920
And then you're like, wait.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.360
Are we all doing ratatouilles?

29:43.360 --> 29:45.200
But you don't actually cook anything here.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.440
Like, yeah, my rat does business.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.320
I have a business rat.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.520
He got his degree in accounting.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.120
Hey, I'm here.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.760
Do you think there was a rat who heard about Remy

29:57.760 --> 30:01.200
and was like, hell yeah, I've always wanted to be a sniper.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.160
An elite sniper.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.080
Ratatouille too.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.120
No one told me I can't do, I'm ratatouille.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.400
No one told me I couldn't do it.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.760
So now I'm gonna do it.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.240
And I don't care about critics because I shoot them

30:14.240 --> 30:16.720
because that's my fucking bag, baby.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.080
Oh, man.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.400
Ratatouille is really good juice.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.600
I just want to let you know that.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.520
Well, thanks, let's ride on the tide

30:27.520 --> 30:39.200
of that great joke to the money zone.

30:39.200 --> 30:39.700
Quip.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.120
Yeah, ratatouille I guess was a quip.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.560
That seems a little reductive though.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.400
It was more kind of a statement of purpose.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.840
Justin, you dumb piece of shit.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.680
I'm talking about the toothbrush company.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.400
Not a funny joke.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.480
Although quip could also mean a funny joke.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.520
But what I mean is the toothbrush company

30:57.520 --> 30:59.920
with their new smart electric toothbrush

30:59.920 --> 31:02.480
and using said smart electric toothbrush,

31:02.480 --> 31:04.960
good habits can earn you great perks,

31:04.960 --> 31:06.320
like free products, gift cards and more.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.320
How it works, you connect it to your phone.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.640
You use this thing called Bluetooth.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.680
It's like a Viking thing and it connects to your phone.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.600
And then as you brush your teeth, your phone goes,

31:15.600 --> 31:17.920
hey, good job brushing your teeth, Travis.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.520
I'm very proud of you.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.880
And so I'm gonna give you a gift card to someplace

31:22.880 --> 31:25.920
because I'm so proud of you, my precious good tooth boy.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.400
It works just like that.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.400
And with the $45 quip smart brush,

31:30.400 --> 31:32.880
which is now for adults and kids,

31:32.880 --> 31:35.040
you could be doing this yourself at home.

31:35.040 --> 31:38.080
Not just listening to me brag about my good teeth,

31:38.080 --> 31:40.480
but you could be getting good teeth too.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.440
And if you already have a quip,

31:41.440 --> 31:42.880
you can upgrade it with a smart motor

31:42.880 --> 31:44.560
and keep all the features you love.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.320
Plus you get brush heads, toothpaste

31:46.320 --> 31:48.640
and floss refills delivered for $5.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.160
Those floss things, by the way, are amazing.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.480
It's like some space age flossing stuff.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.520
I love it.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.720
So start getting rewards for brushing your teeth today

31:58.720 --> 32:02.000
and go to getquip.com slash my brother right now

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000

32:04.000 --> 32:07.920

32:07.920 --> 32:11.920
That's G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.600
Quip, better oral health, made simple and rewarding.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.360
I'm a dad.

32:17.360 --> 32:17.760
What?

32:17.760 --> 32:19.840
I'm not, yeah, I'm not afraid to admit it.

32:19.840 --> 32:23.840
And this week my wife has been working at the hospital

32:23.840 --> 32:25.520
as she is want to do.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.520
And then yes, I do permit it.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.920
It's very progressive of me, I agree.

32:30.480 --> 32:34.320
But that leaves me in charge of two rambunctious kids

32:34.320 --> 32:37.440
that half of which are not in school

32:37.440 --> 32:40.080
as much as I would have thought they would have been

32:40.080 --> 32:41.920
just a scant year ago.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.960
So I'm a busy dad trying to make it on my own.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.400
You know what my secret weapon is

32:46.400 --> 32:47.840
when lunchtime is around the corner?

32:47.840 --> 32:48.640
Alcohol.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.720
Boo, a little scotchy scotch.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.440
A little something, a little snoot for dad

32:53.440 --> 32:54.320
but then for the kids.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.760
And a little sip for them.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.280
I don't reach for a container of mac and cheese.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.760
I reach for my phone to have someone bring me

33:01.760 --> 33:03.040
mac and cheese that's done.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.880
Thank you DoorDash for helping me to keep my children fed.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.960
I ask them, it's fun for them.

33:08.960 --> 33:09.680
I let them pick.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.040
What are you guys in the mood for?

33:11.040 --> 33:12.000
You can have whatever you want

33:12.000 --> 33:15.280
because DoorDash has like a bajillion restaurants,

33:15.280 --> 33:18.240
local places too so you can support local businesses

33:18.240 --> 33:23.360
that you can't or shouldn't be attending in person right now.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.160
You can still support them with DoorDash.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.000
Justin, what do they say they want?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
They want a little coq au vin, huh?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.720
They want a little coq au vin, a little chicken tendel.

33:33.680 --> 33:34.560
Ordering is easy.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.960
Open the app, you look for the food you want to eat,

33:36.960 --> 33:38.400
you order the food, they bring it to you.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.720
It's beautiful, it's fast, it's efficient.

33:41.280 --> 33:45.840
It really is what made my life

33:45.840 --> 33:51.440
especially when I am watching two, yes, two children on my own.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.240
All by yourself?

33:53.040 --> 33:55.200
Yeah, that's twice as many people as I am.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.840
You know what, I have also a little life hack from me to you.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.000
Got a friend whose birthday it is

34:02.000 --> 34:03.680
or maybe they're having a bad day?

34:03.680 --> 34:07.520
DoorDash them a cupcake or two from a local bakery.

34:07.520 --> 34:08.080
17.

34:08.080 --> 34:08.960
Brighten up their day.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.400
Right now our listeners can get $5 off the first order

34:12.400 --> 34:16.240
of $15 or more and zero delivery fees for the first month

34:16.240 --> 34:19.360
when you download the DoorDash app and enter code BROTHER.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.960
That's $5 off your first order and zero delivery fees for a month

34:22.960 --> 34:24.880
when you download the DoorDash app in the app store

34:24.880 --> 34:26.560
and enter code BROTHER.

34:26.560 --> 34:31.120
Don't forget, that's code BROTHER for $5 off your first order with DoorDash.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.040
Hey friends, Jesse here, the founder of Maximum Fun

34:35.040 --> 34:37.200
and I have some really great news to share with you.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.680
This year has brought a lot of changes for all of us.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.040
And one tradition that we were grateful to be able to hold on to

34:45.040 --> 34:48.240
is our annual pin sale to benefit charity.

34:48.240 --> 34:50.800
This year, through your generosity and love of pins,

34:50.800 --> 34:57.120
you helped raise $95,400 for GiveDirectly.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.920
If you're a member and you bought pins, they'll ship in January.

34:59.920 --> 35:03.520
In the meantime, your support will provide direct cash relief

35:03.520 --> 35:07.360
to families impacted by COVID-19 across the United States.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.280
Even in this incredibly tough year,

35:09.280 --> 35:12.800
the MaxFun community remains extraordinarily kind.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.320
And whether or not you bought pins,

35:14.320 --> 35:19.040
you can continue to help by heading to GiveDirectly.org.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.040
As always, thank you.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.960
Um, do y'all want to know Yahoo?

35:28.080 --> 35:29.120
Yeah, I love that, Griffin.

35:29.120 --> 35:32.400
Okay, this one was sent in by TheWizardBenCant.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.680
Thank you for asking by the way.

35:33.680 --> 35:34.480
Oh, sure.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.800
Yeah, if you could imagine if I actually did it for real,

35:36.800 --> 35:40.480
what, that's real bad boy behavior, not me.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.160
An anonymous Yahoo Answers user asked this.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.400
I'm going to call Jameson's.

35:48.400 --> 35:52.000
Asks, how do I stop my boyfriend

35:52.000 --> 35:55.040
from reading me bedtime stories without hurting his feelings?

35:55.840 --> 35:58.400
My boyfriend recently started reading me bedtime stories

35:58.400 --> 35:59.360
a couple of weeks ago.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.600
It was a joke at first because I'd said

36:01.600 --> 36:04.800
I wouldn't be able to sleep when I downed three coffees

36:04.800 --> 36:05.680
that afternoon.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.800
The problem is he has done it every night since.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.760
And he makes terrible mouth noises.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.680
I don't even know where they are coming from.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.360
It only happens when he's reading out loud.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.760
It makes me so irrationally angry and annoyed

36:17.760 --> 36:20.560
that it takes me even longer to fall asleep than before.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.880
I am tired and exhausted, but I love this man.

36:22.880 --> 36:23.600
Please help.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.760
And that's from Rosario Dawson.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.640
That's from Scarlett Johansson,

36:30.640 --> 36:34.080
complaining about funny man, Colin Jones.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.080
Can we all, why did she label it?

36:36.080 --> 36:37.680
Nobody knows.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.160
Until we got to the mouth sounds part,

36:40.160 --> 36:41.920
I was thinking, this sounds nice.

36:44.080 --> 36:48.000
Listen, I also am a dad and I also have two kids.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.920
And when I'm putting the older one to bed,

36:49.920 --> 36:50.960
I will read her a book.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.400
I don't do this for the younger one

36:52.400 --> 36:54.320
because she doesn't know what a book is.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.640
I'll sing her songs, don't worry.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.200
But I read to the older one and every time I do,

36:59.200 --> 37:02.000
I think, who's going to put me to bed?

37:02.000 --> 37:05.120
Where's the 12 foot tall person who's gonna carry me

37:05.120 --> 37:08.960
upstairs, make sure I go potty and put me to bed.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.400
That's all I want.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.120
Mine is Matthew McConaughey on the Calm app.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.080
He just sets me up.

37:14.080 --> 37:14.560
Oh yeah?

37:15.200 --> 37:17.120
He's got a story on there where he talks about

37:19.200 --> 37:21.200
the infinite light of the universe.

37:21.200 --> 37:25.600
In many ways, I think maybe ASMR artists

37:25.600 --> 37:28.640
read me bedtime stories now that I'm thinking about it.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.600
It's a good way of thinking about it.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.560
Maybe that's it.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.880
It's like a bedtime story where someone pretends

37:32.880 --> 37:34.160
to give you a cranial nerve exam.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.520
Yes, or maybe eat some Kentucky fried chicken in front of me.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.680
Don't fucking do that stuff, bud.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.480
I don't like hearing about your perversion.

37:42.480 --> 37:45.840
I will not sit here in front of our audience

37:45.840 --> 37:50.720
who are basically our kids and be besmirched by you, sir,

37:50.720 --> 37:53.040
just because you're so small minded,

37:53.040 --> 37:55.280
you won't watch someone eat a bunch of noodles.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.400
It's perverse.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.040
You're perverse.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.000
The idea that you would willingly subject yourself

38:02.000 --> 38:05.040
to food eating noises is honestly, Travis,

38:05.680 --> 38:06.720
the worst thing about you.

38:06.720 --> 38:07.440
What would you rather?

38:07.440 --> 38:08.480
And that list is not short.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.280
What would you rather?

38:09.280 --> 38:10.080
I'm watching-

38:10.080 --> 38:10.720
Well detailed.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.720
You want me to watch whale noises?

38:12.720 --> 38:14.400
You whale pervert, huh?

38:14.400 --> 38:15.440
Is that what you want?

38:15.440 --> 38:17.840
For me to hear whales talking to each other?

38:17.840 --> 38:18.320
Or maybe-

38:18.320 --> 38:18.880
Infinitely better.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.520
Just maybe.

38:19.520 --> 38:20.240
Infinitely better.

38:20.240 --> 38:23.280
And you've also chosen, by the way, a beautiful animal sound.

38:23.280 --> 38:23.760
So maybe try harder.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.120
You don't fucking know what they're saying

38:25.120 --> 38:26.160
with those dirty birds.

38:26.160 --> 38:26.640
You can't even-

38:26.640 --> 38:27.120
Yeah, they can.

38:27.120 --> 38:30.800
You can't even come up with something that is more foul

38:30.800 --> 38:32.720
than what you're describing because there isn't anything.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.160
I'm just saying that to me,

38:34.160 --> 38:36.480
hearing whales shit talk dolphins,

38:36.480 --> 38:38.000
which is what it is, let's be honest.

38:38.000 --> 38:38.720
It's what it is.

38:38.720 --> 38:39.440
That's what it is.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.560
They're little whales.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.520
They're shit talking dolphins.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.880
Look at these dumb small whales.

38:44.880 --> 38:48.240
You think that's better than me enjoying someone

38:48.240 --> 38:50.720
having the new Popeye's chicken sandwich?

38:51.280 --> 38:52.880
That's how they shit talk the sun too.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.040
Look at that huge bright whale.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.720
It's not even in the water.

38:56.720 --> 38:57.840
It's a shitty whale.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.600
I mean, what are these white puffy whales?

38:59.600 --> 39:03.680
And these whales with wings?

39:03.680 --> 39:04.960
Don't get me started.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.280
Look at that touching the water.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.800
It's the beach.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.000
It's like a giant whale made of very small whales.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.760
I'm going to swim up and crush it.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.560
Oh no.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.680
Oh no.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.520
Oh, what have I done?

39:17.520 --> 39:18.640
Someone blow me up.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.440
I messed up.

39:21.440 --> 39:21.840
You got to-

39:21.840 --> 39:27.520
What if the whale was both conscious and speaking English?

39:27.520 --> 39:29.200
Like, listen, I got bad news for you.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.720
You're going to have to blow me up.

39:32.720 --> 39:33.440
You're going to have to-

39:33.440 --> 39:34.960
No whale.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.320
There has to be other options.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.920
We can get some-

39:37.920 --> 39:38.720
No, no, no.

39:38.720 --> 39:41.040
Listen, don't let me get stinky out here.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.960
It's going to take me days to die.

39:42.960 --> 39:43.920
Please just blow me up.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.720
Go get some of those round red exploding whales

39:46.720 --> 39:49.360
and tuck them in my hollow rotten stomach.

39:49.360 --> 39:54.560
I want to go meet the big whale up in the giant whale.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.880
Get the big blue whale.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.640
Hey, do you guys ever look up at the big black whale

40:00.640 --> 40:03.040
with those little shining whales in it and wonder,

40:03.040 --> 40:04.560
are there any other whales out there?

40:05.760 --> 40:09.200
I mean, other than the billions of visible

40:09.200 --> 40:11.840
and non-visible microscopic whales that surround us every day.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.240
But I mean, are there other whales on other whales up there

40:14.240 --> 40:16.240
looking back at our whale with us on it?

40:16.240 --> 40:18.880
I can't wait to go meet the big sky whale and say,

40:18.880 --> 40:21.840
hey, sky whale, what was the deal with baleen?

40:21.840 --> 40:23.920
That shit is weird.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.280
Was that really the best option?

40:25.280 --> 40:27.440
Could you have given me some bigger whales to eat?

40:27.440 --> 40:28.880
You gave me tiny whales.

40:28.880 --> 40:32.560
One time a bird accidentally fell in the water and drowned

40:32.560 --> 40:34.720
and I seen him and he didn't have baleen.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.640
So what's up, sky whale?

40:36.640 --> 40:41.040
Hey, big blue whale, why did thou name me after jizz?

40:41.040 --> 40:42.720
Not cool, dude.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.800
Couldn't we have just been friends?

40:44.800 --> 40:47.440
Couldn't we have just been Jeff Whales?

40:47.440 --> 40:51.280
My name's Jeff and most of us are down here.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.960
Hey, big blue whale, how come there's no whale week on TV?

40:54.960 --> 40:56.080
We're way cooler.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.720
We're way bigger, yeah.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.440
Way bigger.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.560
What if they decide they're gonna eat all the sharks

41:02.560 --> 41:05.120
or mean whales as they call them?

41:05.120 --> 41:06.800
Bitey whales.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.320
They're gonna eat all the bitey whales

41:08.320 --> 41:10.160
so they get a week of their very own.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.640
They're talking to killer whales and it's like,

41:12.640 --> 41:15.280
hey, you're kind of a go-between between us and the bitey whales.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.760
Tell them we want to join up.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.200
We want to join up whales and bitey whales together

41:21.840 --> 41:24.000
or we'll be unstoppable.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.760
Hey, big blue whale, why did you call us killer whales?

41:27.760 --> 41:29.040
You know, I'm a dad.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.160
And first and a podcaster second.

41:32.960 --> 41:33.760
And a-

41:33.760 --> 41:35.040
Hey, is this still the whale talking?

41:35.040 --> 41:35.680
Is this the whale?

41:35.680 --> 41:38.240
And a flautist, I'm a flautist third.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.840
See, now there's distance between them.

41:39.840 --> 41:40.880
Okay, great, great, great.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.640
I can think of other things people do.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.800
I've still got it.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.000
How about another question?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.400
Y'all know that Cory Booker reads books

41:50.400 --> 41:53.280
to Rosario Dawson over the phone.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.720
Yeah, that's why I mentioned Rosario Dawson earlier.

41:57.360 --> 41:59.680
That's the service that Cory Booker provides

41:59.680 --> 42:00.960
to his girlfriend, Rosario Dawson.

42:00.960 --> 42:04.240
I don't read Us Weekly or wherever this info is coming from.

42:04.240 --> 42:07.360
Okay, I'm just saying it's a dope strat.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.520
That's a dope love strat, I like that.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.160
Now it's nice, no, it's definitely nice.

42:12.160 --> 42:12.880
It's definitely nice.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.560
Good morning, Rosario Dawson.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.520
Would you like to hear more of the lovely-

42:15.520 --> 42:16.960
Here's the very hungry caterpillar.

42:16.960 --> 42:19.120
Would you like more of the lovely bones today?

42:19.120 --> 42:20.000
Oh, okay.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.680
Aren't you busy running for president?

42:21.680 --> 42:23.680
Nah, nah, nah, don't worry about that.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.360
I'm sure that one will go swimmingly.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.240
I get all my news from your stories.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.480
So if you were or weren't running,

42:30.480 --> 42:32.080
I'd have to hear about it in one of your stories

42:32.080 --> 42:33.360
because you don't let me watch the TV.

42:33.360 --> 42:42.240
No, you just get lovely bones in BookerVision.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.240
In Bookerphonic sound.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.680
I've got a scarf today, you know what that means.

42:47.680 --> 42:48.720
I'm going to be enjoying,

42:48.720 --> 42:51.120
you're going to be enjoying some more Dr. Doolittle.

42:51.120 --> 42:51.680
Here we go.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.760
Pygmalion, chapter one in BookerVision.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.080
Here is another question from me to you.

43:00.080 --> 43:00.400
Okay.

43:00.400 --> 43:03.520
My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little under six months.

43:03.520 --> 43:05.600
I've only met her family a handful of times,

43:05.600 --> 43:08.720
but her mother recently asked me to buy her shrooms.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.800
We got to be a little bit more,

43:11.520 --> 43:14.080
that could mean, that sentence could mean 18 different things.

43:14.080 --> 43:16.560
We've got to be a little bit more specific here.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.440
Is it possible I will be doing shrooms with her?

43:20.080 --> 43:22.720
How do I make a shroom trip with my girlfriend's mother

43:22.720 --> 43:25.360
not an entirely awkward experience?

43:25.360 --> 43:28.160
That's from, this is going to be a disaster in Denver,

43:28.160 --> 43:30.400
which with that attitude, it will be.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.440
Is it possible?

43:32.320 --> 43:35.440
Is it possible that your girlfriend's mother

43:35.440 --> 43:37.360
asked you to go to the store

43:37.360 --> 43:39.680
and buy her some regular ass mushrooms?

43:39.680 --> 43:42.400
Some nice cremini for the Thanksgiving stuff?

43:42.400 --> 43:44.000
Just some baby bellas.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.400
Did she say, hey, could you buy me some mushrooms?

43:48.400 --> 43:50.720
And what she meant was for dinner on Friday

43:50.720 --> 43:54.000
and not perhaps a psychotropic experience.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.360
I don't want to get into semantics,

43:55.360 --> 43:56.960
but they're still mushrooms, aren't they?

43:56.960 --> 43:59.360
I mean, you haven't, huh?

43:59.360 --> 44:03.600
It is a test and I don't know which kind

44:04.160 --> 44:07.760
because it's either a test to see if you're a,

44:07.760 --> 44:10.080
you know, fucking a wasteoid,

44:10.080 --> 44:12.480
or it could be a test to see if you're cool

44:12.480 --> 44:14.800
and like to party and cool enough to hang with the mom.

44:15.760 --> 44:17.040
The dad doesn't want to hear,

44:17.680 --> 44:18.560
dad doesn't want to hear,

44:18.560 --> 44:22.080
he turns his head away from this stuff

44:22.080 --> 44:23.200
that the mom likes to do,

44:23.200 --> 44:28.000
which is get whacked out, get totally fucking zooted.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.640
Is it also possible that she wants the shrooms

44:31.680 --> 44:33.680
not to do them with you though?

44:33.680 --> 44:35.760
She's gonna take them back to her house

44:35.760 --> 44:38.080
and just kind of enjoy them

44:38.080 --> 44:41.680
with a nice glass of wine and a relaxing film.

44:41.680 --> 44:44.800
It's very possible to the point where I would say

44:44.800 --> 44:48.160
it is far more impossible that your girlfriend's mother

44:48.160 --> 44:50.320
who you barely know said,

44:50.320 --> 44:53.280
hey, you know what would be fun?

44:54.240 --> 44:56.320
Shrooming with what's-his-face.

44:56.320 --> 44:56.640
Yeah.

44:58.080 --> 45:00.480
Folks, I've bought some drugs in my time.

45:01.280 --> 45:01.520
What?

45:02.720 --> 45:04.080
It is, I would say,

45:04.080 --> 45:07.440
the times when the person I've bought the drugs from

45:07.440 --> 45:09.600
is the person I'm hoping to do drugs with

45:09.600 --> 45:14.400
has been, I would say, in the minority for me personally.

45:14.960 --> 45:18.720
I don't think that's what your girlfriend's mother

45:18.720 --> 45:19.280
is planning right now.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.200
What I do like, though, question asker,

45:21.200 --> 45:23.840
is what you decided to do in this scenario

45:23.840 --> 45:26.240
was not to ask your girlfriend

45:26.960 --> 45:29.280
what your girlfriend's opinion might be,

45:29.280 --> 45:31.680
but rather ask the three of us

45:32.720 --> 45:36.400
who know this mother even less than you do.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.560
If that's even possible.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.960
So I'm gonna say fucking do it, bro.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.160
I think that would be fun as hell.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.800
I haven't shroomed in a dog's age.

45:46.800 --> 45:47.920
Shroomed, is that acceptable?

45:47.920 --> 45:48.480
Probably not.

45:48.480 --> 45:49.840
Is that the accepted?

45:49.840 --> 45:53.840
I haven't, let's see, I haven't mushed in forever.

45:53.840 --> 45:54.640
Mushed is good.

45:54.640 --> 45:55.200
Yeah.

45:55.200 --> 45:55.520
I like mushed.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.480
I haven't had a full-blown mushy in forever.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.040
Right.

45:59.040 --> 46:03.120
And I would love to just mush it up with somebody

46:03.120 --> 46:05.200
and get to know them through that experience.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.360
I will say this, though.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.880
Okay, now wait a minute, hold on.

46:10.240 --> 46:15.040
If the girlfriend's mother was asking you to buy shrooms,

46:15.040 --> 46:17.840
they don't, maybe they're not that looped in.

46:17.840 --> 46:19.200
They just think they'd like to try it.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.480
Are you willing to take the responsibility of like,

46:24.480 --> 46:25.440
here's some shrooms.

46:25.440 --> 46:28.160
Do the right amount of them, I guess.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.800
Don't eat a bunch or too little.

46:30.800 --> 46:31.280
Yeah.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.160
Best of luck.

46:32.160 --> 46:33.760
I feel like they're gonna need,

46:33.760 --> 46:35.360
here's something decent you could do.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.920
You could offer to just be a drug Sherpa.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.840
Oh yeah, you gotta have a spotter.

46:40.560 --> 46:41.840
Listen, let me spot you.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.360
Let me take you to the,

46:43.360 --> 46:45.440
let me help you find the safe rooms in your house.

46:45.440 --> 46:48.000
The rooms that become safe during the experience.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.320
I'll make sure you don't order too much pizza

46:50.320 --> 46:52.080
just to experience it.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.920
Let me remind you that your life water

46:53.920 --> 46:55.280
has become incredibly warm

46:55.280 --> 46:56.880
and you could probably get a new life water

46:56.880 --> 46:58.800
out of the fridge and enjoy that.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.640
I know a lot of people.

47:00.640 --> 47:01.360
I'm not gonna brag.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.240
I know a lot of people.

47:02.240 --> 47:02.880
Here he goes.

47:02.880 --> 47:05.440
I don't know any of them.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.560
Maybe a small handful of very close confidants.

47:09.840 --> 47:13.200
A lot of codicils on this.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.440
I'm just saying, I don't know many people

47:15.440 --> 47:16.400
that I would be like,

47:16.400 --> 47:18.960
I think this is a person who could get me shrooms.

47:19.520 --> 47:20.800
Like, I don't know.

47:20.800 --> 47:24.640
That's such a bold maneuver to posit,

47:24.640 --> 47:27.840
like, you are giving off perhaps

47:27.840 --> 47:29.760
a certain kind of energy question asker

47:29.760 --> 47:31.760
that I personally love.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.000
Travis, you have presupposed that there,

47:34.800 --> 47:38.240
you can have multiple people in your life

47:38.240 --> 47:40.800
that you know they could get you shrooms.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.280
I don't think that that is true for anybody,

47:43.280 --> 47:46.080
but I would argue that most people of a certain age

47:46.800 --> 47:49.760
definitely know that one person

47:50.320 --> 47:53.280
that can for sure get you shrooms.

47:53.280 --> 47:56.320
And it is wild that you have become that person

47:57.280 --> 47:58.880
to your lover's mother.

47:59.600 --> 48:00.480
And can you?

48:01.120 --> 48:03.040
Because, like, you don't address in this,

48:03.040 --> 48:04.400
like, I don't know how to.

48:04.400 --> 48:07.200
You seem like you would be able to.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.120
That doesn't seem to be the question.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.120
Yeah.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.560
One time a girl in gym class

48:12.560 --> 48:14.800
offered to sell me a single Vicodin in a baggie.

48:15.840 --> 48:17.440
And I didn't even,

48:17.440 --> 48:19.440
I was so unplugged in

48:19.440 --> 48:20.960
that I couldn't even really process

48:20.960 --> 48:24.080
that that's what was sort of occurring.

48:24.080 --> 48:25.600
And I was so afraid that it was a crime

48:25.600 --> 48:28.240
to even hear her talking that I got scared

48:28.240 --> 48:29.760
and just kind of walked away.

48:29.760 --> 48:31.520
But later I started thinking about, like,

48:31.520 --> 48:33.120
no one, and here's the thing.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.240
I'm 40 years old now.

48:34.240 --> 48:37.360
No one had ever seen me like that before.

48:37.360 --> 48:39.200
And no one ever saw me like that again.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.520
And I still wonder to this day,

48:42.480 --> 48:45.760
what was the vibe that I gave her

48:45.760 --> 48:48.720
that I've never given another living human being

48:48.720 --> 48:51.280
where it's like, this seems like the kind of guy

48:51.280 --> 48:53.120
who'd buy a single Vicodin in a baggie.

48:53.120 --> 48:54.800
Justin, I've never thought about this before,

48:54.800 --> 48:56.240
but now you're making me think about the fact

48:56.240 --> 48:57.840
no one's ever asked me

48:58.400 --> 49:01.040
if I A, want to buy drugs

49:01.040 --> 49:02.960
or B, know where to buy drugs.

49:03.760 --> 49:04.720
Like, this is never,

49:04.720 --> 49:07.760
and I think I'm approachable.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.360
I think I'm cool.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.440
You know, I've got purple hair.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.520
Well, approachable, definitely.

49:13.520 --> 49:14.720
But no one has ever,

49:15.680 --> 49:17.840
they've offered me drugs, don't get me wrong.

49:17.840 --> 49:20.000
They've offered me drugs.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.040
Yeah, we're podcasters.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.520
But they've never asked if I wanted to buy them

49:24.080 --> 49:25.920
or said, hey, do you know where to buy drugs?

49:25.920 --> 49:27.840
It's just never, huh.

49:27.840 --> 49:30.160
One time I was visiting, when I was in college,

49:30.160 --> 49:35.760
I went over to my girlfriend's old friend's place.

49:35.760 --> 49:40.240
He lived in a frat house to go play Halo

49:40.240 --> 49:42.720
because I was just trying to ingratiate myself

49:42.720 --> 49:43.840
to her friends.

49:43.840 --> 49:47.600
And I went over there and realized nobody else was there.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.240
I thought it was going to be more of a land party vibe.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.880
But no, it was just me and this gentleman.

49:52.880 --> 49:56.000
And we played some Halo and he made some remarks.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.320
And then at one point he said,

49:58.320 --> 50:00.640
hey man, do you want some Xanny bars?

50:01.360 --> 50:03.280
And I said, oh yeah.

50:03.280 --> 50:05.280
Thinking that that was going to be

50:05.280 --> 50:12.000
some sort of delectable, some sort of tasty thing.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.040
Like I thought maybe the frat house just had a bake sale.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.160
And then he brought out like-

50:18.160 --> 50:21.680
My man Xanny makes these bars so good.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.520
Fucking condensed milk, coconut.

50:23.520 --> 50:28.560
He brought out this cloudy sandwich bag

50:28.560 --> 50:30.720
of what were very clearly pills.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.720
And I said, oh no, I don't.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.120
No, sorry.

50:35.120 --> 50:35.920
Sorry there, Bronco.

50:35.920 --> 50:36.560
That's on him.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.400
These are antacids because we're about to eat

50:38.400 --> 50:39.360
so many Xanny bars.

50:39.360 --> 50:42.560
Marshmallow and chocolate chips Xanny bars, baby.

50:42.560 --> 50:44.880
Sorry, I thought you said Zanza bars.

50:44.880 --> 50:46.560
And I would have loved that.

50:46.560 --> 50:48.000
That one's on him though, Griffin.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.080
That's not your fault because that's not in the bar form at all.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.160
So like, what the fuck was he even talking about?

50:54.160 --> 50:55.360
I don't know.

50:55.360 --> 50:59.040
I didn't do much research into it after the fact.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.200
Honestly, was I embarrassed?

51:03.200 --> 51:03.600
Yes.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.080
Was I embarrassed that I whiffed it that bad

51:06.720 --> 51:09.760
in front of somebody who just moments before

51:10.720 --> 51:13.200
I intended to impress in some way?

51:14.240 --> 51:14.720
Yes.

51:14.720 --> 51:18.240
But was that embarrassment completely overshadowed

51:18.240 --> 51:20.720
by my disappointment that I wasn't about to eat

51:20.720 --> 51:24.960
some delicious, gooey, moist Xanny bars?

51:24.960 --> 51:25.520
Yeah.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.280
Something you've never even heard of before.

51:27.280 --> 51:29.280
Damn, I was so certain in that moment

51:29.280 --> 51:32.000
that I was gonna fucking yummy those up.

51:32.000 --> 51:32.480
Damn it.

51:33.280 --> 51:36.320
Hey, thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

51:36.320 --> 51:37.360
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

51:39.760 --> 51:42.960
We hope you're having a good week.

51:43.520 --> 51:48.480
Just a reminder to stay at home this week

51:48.480 --> 51:53.600
and don't gather with your family who-

51:53.600 --> 51:54.240
Or friends.

51:55.200 --> 51:58.080
Or friends who you don't see every single day.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.600
There's no special magic about-

52:01.600 --> 52:02.640
Well, there's love.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.360
There's holiday love.

52:03.360 --> 52:04.400
No, Chris.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.640
But not a special magic that's going to protect you from-

52:06.640 --> 52:08.960
Yeah, COVID don't care about love.

52:08.960 --> 52:11.360
If there's one thing I've learned from that hit

52:11.360 --> 52:14.240
country and western song, COVID don't care about love,

52:14.240 --> 52:15.840
it's that COVID don't care about love.

52:15.840 --> 52:17.040
Don't care about love, yeah.

52:17.040 --> 52:20.560
Yeah, so please be safe, be smart.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.400
Though I will say, speaking of love,

52:22.400 --> 52:26.160
thank you to everybody who came to the live show,

52:26.160 --> 52:27.360
who watched the live show.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.640
It was such a fun experience.

52:28.640 --> 52:30.880
And everybody, you were so lovely afterwards

52:30.880 --> 52:33.760
and you're gonna make us wanna do it again.

52:33.760 --> 52:36.080
Yeah, we will never tour again.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.360
This is it now.

52:37.360 --> 52:37.840
Are you kidding?

52:37.840 --> 52:39.920
This is our new WALL-E style of tour.

52:39.920 --> 52:43.280
I got to fucking sleep in my bed that night, my bed.

52:43.280 --> 52:45.360
I got to, right before the show, I took a shower

52:45.360 --> 52:48.000
and I used my special prescription strength

52:48.000 --> 52:51.040
anti-dandruff shampoo in my shower.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.680
I am never leaving the house again.

52:53.680 --> 52:54.080
Thank you.

52:55.040 --> 52:55.520
Thank you so much.

52:55.520 --> 52:57.280
Thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

52:58.800 --> 53:00.800
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.880
Great tunes, baby.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.360
Good friends, good fun, good tunes.

53:05.360 --> 53:08.560
Great tunes, and thanks to Maximum Fun

53:08.560 --> 53:09.120

53:09.120 --> 53:10.160

53:10.160 --> 53:12.480
There's a really great podcast I'd like to tell you about.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.760
It's called The Besties.

53:13.760 --> 53:17.440

53:17.440 --> 53:21.920
either a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X, and you-

53:21.920 --> 53:23.840
He's about to pivot into asking our listeners.

53:23.840 --> 53:24.640
For sure, for sure, for sure.

53:24.640 --> 53:25.440
Oh, no, no, no.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.760
I was going to say, if you want to hear people talk about them

53:27.760 --> 53:32.720

Yeah, but it's not.
