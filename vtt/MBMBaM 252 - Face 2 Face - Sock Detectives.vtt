WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.080 --> 00:11.400
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.400 --> 00:16.760
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:16.760 --> 00:21.080
cool they are for listening.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
What's up, you cool baby?

00:22.080 --> 00:49.080
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:49.080 --> 01:08.600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.400
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.680
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.680
Thank you for that.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.440
And I'm going to need about half of you to leave.

01:21.440 --> 01:28.000
There's too many human beings in this room to watch us do our dick goofs.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.920
I pooped my pants at the drive-over.

01:31.920 --> 01:37.760
I didn't want you guys to be the ones to put me on blast on the drive to Chicago and poop

01:37.760 --> 01:38.760
my pants.

01:38.760 --> 01:43.600
Justin turned to us while we were downstairs in the backstage area, and he said, don't

01:43.600 --> 01:47.640
worry guys, I got the opener, I got it covered.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.600
I knew that one of you motherfuckers, if I was like, we worked our way around to it,

01:52.600 --> 01:55.280
all you would need to hear are the words poop or pants, and you'd be like, you know, I know

01:55.280 --> 01:56.800
somebody who pooped his pants accidentally.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.440
That reminds me of an anecdote.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.440
So there, I'm the one who said it, I'm owning it.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.680
Here's what happened, Charlie pooped her pants, and Justin was like, I can't let her take

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
all this heat.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.680
No.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.760
This is on me.

02:11.760 --> 02:17.040
I thought it was a dress rehearsal, and my butt thought it was opening night, and describe

02:17.040 --> 02:23.120
to them, describe, no, but you guys are getting, okay, get ready, this is the show now, because

02:23.120 --> 02:26.400
you're getting 10% of the goddamn story right now.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.400
My wife kept asking.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.600
The 90%, the iceberg below the surface that you don't know is the window of time in which

02:31.600 --> 02:37.520
this catastrophe elapsed, Justin, in which the prolapse elapsed, do you want to go ahead

02:37.520 --> 02:38.520
and tell us?

02:38.520 --> 02:43.680
We were leaving Milwaukee, we'd been on the road for two minutes, and we had been talking

02:43.680 --> 02:46.720
about how the architecture of Milwaukee was very varied.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.760
And Justin suddenly dropped out of the conversation rather quickly, saying, huh, look at that

02:52.760 --> 02:54.280
industrial build.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.360
This is strange, because this is one of Justin's favorite conversation topics.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.560
Where'd you go, man?

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
You really dropped the ball.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.560
Turns out, he shit his pants.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.560
In like two minutes, we literally just left the hotel.

03:03.560 --> 03:08.100
And then he was like, we should really stop and get gas before we go too much farther.

03:08.100 --> 03:12.800
And I was like, yeah, we need gas really bad, we should stop somewhere right away.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.840
I don't care if we're on the road or not.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.200
My wife kept asking me, how did it happen?

03:18.200 --> 03:20.280
It's totally the usual, right?

03:20.280 --> 03:22.760
It's very erudite of her, as she usually is.

03:22.760 --> 03:25.640
It's a fucking terrific question, Justin, how did it happen?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.640
You're a 30-something adult man.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.760
What I can't say is, it just happened.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.080
She said, it doesn't just happen.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.080
Just keep living.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.740
Life finds a way, baby, chaos theory.

03:37.740 --> 03:40.600
Put that drop of water on your hand, it's not going to roll the same way, because you

03:40.600 --> 03:44.040
shit your pants, and it puts some fucking English on the ball or something.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.040
I don't know.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.000
I changed the course of human history.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.480
You changed the course of our history.

03:49.480 --> 03:54.120
This episode's history has been diverted, I would say.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.200
Is anybody here never listened to our show before?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.860
It's okay.

03:58.860 --> 03:59.960
That's actually a lot of people, actually.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.080
I'm kind of uncomfortable now.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.520
It doesn't always start this way.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.400
What we do, we usually don't shit our pants.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.800
Yeah, it's not our M.O., it's self defecation.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.960
Sydney really freaked me out, she said, no, it's like breaking the seal.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.440
Once you poop your pants in adult life, you're just this sort of person.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.440
She's a doctor.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.440
She's a doctor.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.800
She knows what she's talking about.

04:22.800 --> 04:27.400
We take questions, and we turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.240
See, typically in the intro, we establish that we are authority figures on something,

04:32.240 --> 04:33.240
and thereby we are able to give advice.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.920
I'm an authority figure on honesty.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.400
Yeah, I guess.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.980
On forthrightness.

04:38.980 --> 04:39.980
On coming clean.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.680
What is our first question?

04:41.680 --> 04:46.120
Chicago has a long history of impressively manly mustaches, a la Mike Ditka.

04:46.120 --> 04:51.960
Oh, what's up Chicago?

04:51.960 --> 04:57.360
There's a certain amount of authority that comes with some thick Tom Selleck lip foliage.

04:57.360 --> 05:04.640
What, as a lady, can I develop as a feature that gives me that instant air of authority?

05:04.640 --> 05:07.520
That's from number one Hunnidoll watch fan, and I have one for-

05:07.520 --> 05:08.600
So sorry for your loss.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
So sorry.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.600
So sorry to lose the classic bit.

05:12.600 --> 05:17.160
And I have one more for you, and it is unibrow.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.520
You're saying that's like a high mustache.

05:19.520 --> 05:24.120
It takes the mustache, and it moves it up here.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.080
Unibrow, it raises the handlebar.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.480
That's good.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.080
You should be the brand manager.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.080
I'm the brand manager.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.280
He's the madman of unibrows.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.280
Picture this.

05:37.280 --> 05:42.280
John Hamm reclining next to a pool, unibrow, no lettuce, just that, and everyone goes,

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
good look.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.280
That's good.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.280
That's good.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.280
You got the deal.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.280
Also, you're drunk at work.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.280
Go home.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.280
John Hamm.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.280
Whoa.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.280
You know what's weird?

05:52.280 --> 05:54.440
The premiere of Mad Men is airing right this very second.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.440
Yeah.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.440
So none of these people got that joke.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.440
No spoilers.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.440
Because obviously they've never seen the show before.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.440
No big Mad Men fans.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.440
I assume you'd be home.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.440
What about a mustache and a unibrow?

06:01.440 --> 06:05.240
It's just a big fucking hairy equals sign on your face.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.840
You guys know that it's not like everyone can grow a unibrow by choice.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.960
If they just let go of their will for a second.

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
I can't.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
I can't grow a mustache.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
Oh, God.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
I lost my concentration.

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
Right.

06:16.960 --> 06:17.960
Yeah.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.000
People only spend 10% of their brains because the other 9% are like, don't you grow hair

06:20.000 --> 06:21.860
between my eyebrows.

06:21.860 --> 06:22.860
Don't you do it.

06:22.860 --> 06:23.860
Don't do it.

06:23.860 --> 06:24.860
Oh, man.

06:24.860 --> 06:25.860
Mad Men's on.

06:25.860 --> 06:26.860
Poof.

06:26.860 --> 06:27.860
Shit.

06:27.860 --> 06:28.860
Yeah.

06:28.860 --> 06:29.860
With the Limitless pill, you can grow it.

06:29.860 --> 06:30.860
No.

06:30.860 --> 06:33.800
You could do a beehive hairdo.

06:33.800 --> 06:34.800
That's good.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.640
No one says shit to that lady.

06:37.640 --> 06:41.240
No one's ever cut her in line and expected her to be like, oh, whatever.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
You got it.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.240
They're afraid to cut.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.240
They're for bees.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
Yeah.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.240
No, Trav.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.240
They don't.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.640
What about the renaissance?

06:49.640 --> 06:52.560
You know, when they put the bird cages in their giant hairstyle?

06:52.560 --> 06:54.360
Oh, with the living bird.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.160
With the living bird in there?

06:56.160 --> 06:57.160
You could just do that.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
I'll do bird.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.800
That's a real power move.

06:59.800 --> 07:04.120
That's great because it says, I don't care about living things.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.120
Including myself.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.120
Including myself.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.120
Especially myself.

07:07.120 --> 07:12.160
I'm willing for an hour of beauty to be shit on until I get this thing out because that

07:12.160 --> 07:13.520
is what happened, you guys.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.560
They weren't like thinking about the bird's well-being at that point.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.560
It wasn't a pet.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.040
You're such an activist up here, man.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.040
I'm just saying.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.040
Like, you should be keeping this to the goofs.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.000
We lost a lot of good birds.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.720
You're getting a little preachy about hair birds.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.720
The hair.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.720
It's an epidemic.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.200
Everybody has it for just pennies a day.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.760
You could save these hair birds.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
How about a...

07:32.760 --> 07:36.560
I feel bad for those birds, though, because you know they had to have a moment where they

07:36.560 --> 07:39.600
look around like, this is much worse than freedom.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.600
I'm in a lady's hair.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.120
I think I'm going to die now.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.580
And if enough of that happens enough times, eventually you're Brenda Fricker from Home

07:48.580 --> 07:50.640
Alone 2.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.640
And her weird hair bird goes.

07:51.640 --> 07:55.240
Wait, no, you're not, though, because she didn't kill birds with her hair.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.880
Not in the scenes that you saw.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.680
Oh, it hit the cutting room floor.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.680
Get the Blu-Ray, motherfucker.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.680
It's all there.

08:00.680 --> 08:05.120
No, I feel like we can't leave in the scenes where Brenda kills the birds with her hair.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.560
It just sends the wrong message.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.560
Too much for kids.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.400
That's why every movie has that disclaimer.

08:09.400 --> 08:13.560
No animals, including birds, were harmed in the making of this production.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.080
They had to put that as the Fricker clause.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
How about a Yahoo answer?

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
Yes, please.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.080
Oh.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.080
Ooh.

08:19.080 --> 08:24.360
A lot of Yahoo answers fans in the audience.

08:24.360 --> 08:27.160
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.960
Are you Ira Ray?

08:28.960 --> 08:31.600
Oh, man.

08:31.600 --> 08:38.480
That's too dumb a goof to, like, get a call and response for.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.120
Apparently not.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.120
Thank you, Ira Ray.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.840
The website won't load.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.640
No dogs allowed.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.960
I don't think, yeah.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.920
Let's say Jordan.

08:53.920 --> 08:54.920
Jordash.

08:54.920 --> 08:55.920
Jordash asks.

08:55.920 --> 09:04.720
Jordash asks, any ideas for a sexy tongue trick?

09:04.720 --> 09:08.800
At parties, girls will tie knots in cherry stems and the guys will think it's hot.

09:08.800 --> 09:14.000
I can do it too, but I wanted to know if there are other tricks like the cherry stem one

09:14.000 --> 09:17.080
that I can do to impress everyone.

09:17.080 --> 09:25.400
Has any dude ever seen a girl tie a cherry stem with her tongue and thought, that's hot.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.920
She could probably tie my wiener with her tongue.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.920
I think it's scientifically proven that it can't be done, right?

09:31.920 --> 09:32.960
That's crazy.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.520
You don't have tongue fingers.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.640
What skill does that indicate that a dude's like, awesome.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.640
Awesome.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.640
Cool.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.640
I'd love for you to tie it in a knot.

09:41.640 --> 09:47.880
I love it when she twists my wiener.

09:47.880 --> 09:52.040
Usually the secret is, you know, your stuff already tied one down your lip and you switch

09:52.040 --> 09:53.040
them out.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
Whoa.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
Hold on.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.840
Hold on behind the magic.

09:56.840 --> 09:57.840
Behind the magic.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.480
Behind the sex magic tricks.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.960
I need to go Lance Burton on you guys, but that was the breaks.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.320
Hey, Lance keeps his mouth shut.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.040
What I'm saying is maybe it doesn't have to be a tied cherry stem.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.920
What if you put a regular cherry stem in there, you pull out a stick of Juicy Fruit.

10:13.920 --> 10:17.960
Now, basically I see that shit coming.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.880
That's sexy.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.880
What if you went around- Is it?

10:20.880 --> 10:21.880
Wait, hold on.

10:21.880 --> 10:22.880
Is it?

10:22.880 --> 10:28.320
You pull out some soggy Juicy Fruit and it's like, oh, I'm bonered.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.320
I'm 34.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.800
I have literally no way of knowing.

10:33.800 --> 10:38.400
Can you just go around the party untying everybody else's tied cherry-

10:38.400 --> 10:39.400
What a wait.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.400
Hold on.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.400
Let me see that.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
What have you tied?

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
Give me that.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.400
God.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.400
You're welcome.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
This was a perfectly good cherry stem.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.400
What about a whole orange?

10:47.400 --> 10:48.400
You put a whole orange in your mouth.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
And you peel it?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400
Like Mr. Peepers.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.120
And then you pull out a peeled orange.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.440
That's how Houdini died.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.440
It's not.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.800
I used to have a pretty good sexy tongue trick when I was younger, where I would make a spit

11:01.800 --> 11:04.760
bubble and blow it off- Oh no, this is the fucking worst trick in

11:04.760 --> 11:05.840
the universe.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.600
And everyone saw it and went, I want to have sex with that cherry.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.680
You don't understand.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.520
He's not talking about blowing spit bubbles like the rest of us normal non-reptilian human

11:13.520 --> 11:14.520
beings do.

11:14.520 --> 11:15.520
He could like- You know.

11:15.520 --> 11:19.520
David Bowie labyrinth like, whoo.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.520
He could.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.520
Do it.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.520
Do it.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.520
Do it.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.520
Don't do it.

11:24.520 --> 11:25.520
Don't do it.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
No, this is not.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.520
No, no, no.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.520
No, no, no.

11:28.520 --> 11:32.720
This is not going to be a bit, because I used to be able to blow them and then blow them

11:32.720 --> 11:33.720
off the tongue.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.800
But the secret is you have to blow them with a dream.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.640
And you have to whisper a dream into them.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.240
And I don't have any of those anymore.

11:43.240 --> 11:46.080
So it's just a regular spit bubble on the tongue like a peasant.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.920
And I'm not going to embarrass myself in front of the Athenians.

11:48.920 --> 11:49.920
Yeah.

11:49.920 --> 11:50.920
In Chicago.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.920
The man who just admitted to shitting his pants 20 minutes ago.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.600
I got another question coming in hot.

11:57.600 --> 12:04.240
There's a girl in one of my classes who cuts her fingernails during literally every class.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.840
Right?

12:05.840 --> 12:08.640
This is a challenging episode.

12:08.640 --> 12:14.040
It's a small class, only 12 people, and we sit around one big square table across from

12:14.040 --> 12:19.080
which I can clearly watch her cutting her nails every day twice a week.

12:19.080 --> 12:23.760
We're talking full out nail clippers, little pieces of fingernail flying across the table,

12:23.760 --> 12:25.440
clicking noises, the whole deal.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.440
Clicking noises?

12:26.440 --> 12:27.440
Yeah.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.440
We'd assume they're clicking.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.440
Well, because of her mandibles.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.440
Yeah.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.280
This doesn't seem to be bothering anyone else, but it's awful, right?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
Yeah.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
Am I insane?

12:35.280 --> 12:40.360
And if not, the bigger question at hand is how do I stop this monster without making

12:40.360 --> 12:41.360
it awkward?

12:41.360 --> 12:45.160
And that's from Confrontational Clippings in Chicago.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.160
What are you here?

12:46.160 --> 12:47.160
Right there.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.160
Hey.

12:48.160 --> 12:53.160
Is it possible that everyone else in the class are gaslighting you?

12:53.160 --> 12:54.160
Yeah, it sounds to me.

12:54.160 --> 12:59.680
Because it is impossible that there are, what, class of 12, so 10 other people, non-clipper,

12:59.680 --> 13:02.760
non-you, that are not upset by this.

13:02.760 --> 13:08.400
Because you're sitting in a square which is a shape where everyone's looking at each other.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
So like, they know.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
They know.

13:10.400 --> 13:15.600
Have you not exchanged words with the other people in class, like, hey, what the fuck,

13:15.600 --> 13:17.400
what's going on?

13:17.400 --> 13:19.800
We should all drop this class, right?

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
Yeah.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.400
Because it's obviously some, it's like in movies and TV where they have the psychology

13:24.400 --> 13:28.920
class, but really they're not the students, they're the subjects, and you're being wilded

13:28.920 --> 13:29.920
out on.

13:29.920 --> 13:30.920
We're being...

13:30.920 --> 13:34.240
Wait, wilded out wasn't the trick show, that was Punk'd.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.240
Punk'd was the trick show, everybody.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.240
It was the...

13:36.240 --> 13:37.800
Wait, which one was wilded out?

13:37.800 --> 13:41.400
That was the one where, I don't know, it wasn't the prank show, though, I know that for god

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
damn sure.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.340
We're being too hard on this woman.

13:44.340 --> 13:50.040
Maybe this is the only free time she has to clip her nails, single mom, doing her best,

13:50.040 --> 13:52.520
non-traditional student.

13:52.520 --> 13:57.440
It's the one time of the week she gets to clip her nails and take a moment for herself.

13:57.440 --> 14:01.600
Maybe there's something about the environment that is conducive to nail clipping.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.600
Maybe there's a lot of dreams on the floor.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.680
Yeah, like her god damn kids aren't there for a second.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.400
Judging her for her fingernails.

14:08.400 --> 14:12.120
Judging her, mommy, please pick me up with your long nails.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.120
I can't.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.120
Hook me through the suspenders.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.120
Hook me through the suspenders with your long nails.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.800
The problem is, it's not once a week.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
It's twice a week.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
It's twice a week.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
It is two times a week.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.600
Who cuts their god damn fingernails twice a week?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.280
Okay, the Tuesday is a cut.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.320
It's gotta be Tuesday, Thursday, right?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.320
This is a class.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
Is it Tuesday, Thursday?

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
Okay.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.320
Oh my god.

14:33.320 --> 14:40.120
Within 72 hours, how much of vitamin D?

14:40.120 --> 14:45.360
Yeah, it's D. Don't stay out in the sun too long, because then you go back in and it's

14:45.360 --> 14:46.360
like, oh god, no.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.360
I'm Wolverine.

14:47.360 --> 14:53.760
Wolverine can only use his special powers if he gets affected by D.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.760
He's solar powered.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.760
I'm so, so.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.760
Superman's solar powered.

14:56.760 --> 14:57.760
It's not that weird.

14:57.760 --> 15:01.760
I'm so sunburned, but luckily I can scratch wicked good right now.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.560
Tuesday is the real cutting day.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.560
Yeah, that's for aesthetics.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.560
Thursday, maintenance.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.560
Cuticle work.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.560
Clean up.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.560
Cuticle work.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.560
Filing.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.800
Thursday is for the ones she missed?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.360
Thursday is the ones she missed.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.920
Oh, I left a lot of corners.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.520
Tuesday, trimming.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.880
Wednesday, leg day.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.440
Thursday, clean up.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.440
Eat clean.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.440
Train dirty.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.440
I don't want to be in her Wednesday class.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.440
Yeah, Wednesday.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.480
Sorry, what was that gym slogan you just posted out?

15:31.480 --> 15:32.480
Eat clean.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.480
Train dirty.

15:33.480 --> 15:34.480
Yeah, okay.

15:34.480 --> 15:39.320
I saw it on a t-shirt in the Wisconsin Dells, and it made a lot of sense.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.320
We're big fans.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.320
We're big fans.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.320
Please, God.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.600
We talked about the Wisconsin Dells for like 15 minutes during last night's show in Milwaukee,

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
and it was unlistenable.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.600
How about a Yahoo!

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
Answer?

15:48.600 --> 15:49.600
Yeah.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.520
You'll get it in post.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.560
This Yahoo! was sent in by Rachel Near.

15:53.560 --> 15:54.560
Thank you, Rachel.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.560
It's by Yahoo!

15:55.560 --> 16:01.440
Answer's user, Violetta, who asks, what does it mean?

16:01.440 --> 16:09.880
When a guy texts a girl a sad wink emoticon.

16:09.880 --> 16:14.860
Get ready for some really solid audio, people at home.

16:14.860 --> 16:19.960
It looks like this, and then it's a semicolon and a frown thing, so like...

16:19.960 --> 16:23.840
Can you guys see that on the Jumbotron pretty clearly?

16:23.840 --> 16:26.760
The one I'm assuming is trained on us?

16:26.760 --> 16:30.240
You're all doing it right now.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.240
What does it mean when a guy texts a girl a sad wink emoticon?

16:33.240 --> 16:36.240
What did I say?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.240
Wish I was in you.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.240
Travis!

16:40.240 --> 16:44.240
I said what you said with different words!

16:44.240 --> 16:48.240
Yeah, you borrowed a serial killer's tongue.

16:48.240 --> 16:53.240
I wish you were the canvas on which I could paint my virginal masterpiece.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.240
Oh, no.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.240
Whoops.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.240
This is it.

16:56.240 --> 17:01.240
This fucking question's over now, it's done.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.240
You guys killed it.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.240
You're the unspoiled pasture on which I'll plant my seeds.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.240
Oh, man.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.240
Is it possible...

17:08.240 --> 17:09.240
Anything's possible now.

17:09.240 --> 17:16.240
Is it possible he said that he wants to have sex when he lost his eyeball?

17:16.240 --> 17:17.240
Today?

17:17.240 --> 17:18.240
No.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.240
Oh, why'd I climb that tree?

17:22.240 --> 17:25.240
Why'd I climb that tree?

17:25.240 --> 17:30.240
The leading cause of eyeball fatalities?

17:30.240 --> 17:31.240
Eyeball allergy.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.240
It's got pointy stems and shit.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.240
Yeah, sure.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.240
I don't get out in nature a lot.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.240
I work on the internet.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.240
No, it makes a lot of sense.

17:37.240 --> 17:41.240
It's got pointy stems and shit.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.240
Whoa, I just got a text alert here.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.240
Breaking news.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.240
Haunted doll watch.

17:46.240 --> 17:50.240
We got a fresh haunted doll coming in hot.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.240
If you want him, Terry Gross, come and claim him.

17:53.240 --> 17:57.240
Come and get me, Terry.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.240
For those of you who haven't listened to the show before, Terry Gross tried to kill her

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
podcast.

18:01.240 --> 18:07.240
Haunted spirit doll, genie, caution, porcelain doll, five years, orbs, ghosts, EMF.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.240
Let me see.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.240
It's more SEO themed.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
She's very...

18:11.240 --> 18:12.240
I don't like that one bit.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.240
Do not like it.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.240
That's the most present any of these doll faces has ever been.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.240
Here's a general disclaimer about ghosts in dolls.

18:19.240 --> 18:23.240
All spirits take on a special vessel to claim as their home until the point that they do

18:23.240 --> 18:24.240
cross over the other side.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.240
That may take months.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.240
Boring text.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.240
Come on.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240
No, wait, listen.

18:28.240 --> 18:32.240
That's going to take months or thousands of years to do so.

18:32.240 --> 18:38.240
If you choose a doll to live in for thousands of years, you should have...

18:38.240 --> 18:39.240
It's rent control.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.240
I get a really good rate on this doll.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.240
I got a great deal on this doll.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.240
You guys are focusing on the thousands of years.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.240
I focus on the months because it's never less than two months.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.240
I'm still unpacking this doll.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.240
I haven't even found the good restaurants around the doll yet.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.240
Just like us, there's a lot to unpack here.

18:57.240 --> 19:00.240
If you guys are going on one of your comedy bits every time...

19:00.240 --> 19:01.240
I'll focus up.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.240
This is fucking breaking news.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.240
They claim a host for different reasons just like us.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.240
They may want it to look a certain way for whatever reason that may be.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.240
If they are shy, they may want a mean look.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.240
If they're mean, they may want a shy look.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.240
You can't trust them.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.240
Get a tattoo of this, everybody.

19:19.240 --> 19:25.240
There is absolutely no rhyme or reason of what goes on in the spirit world.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.240
That's some racist shit, it seems like.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.240
They probably have a pretty goddamn good reason for doing what they do.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.240
We just don't understand it.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.240
Jeannie was an only child.

19:35.240 --> 19:40.240
Born to a couple that had waited until they had their career set and were ready to raise a child.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.240
Their names are Joyce and John and they were in their mid-30s.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.240
You're just pulling this out of your ass.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.240
Hold on.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.240
Yes, Travis?

19:47.240 --> 19:49.240
Joyce, John and Jeannie?

19:49.240 --> 19:51.240
Joyce, John and Jeannie, that's what they were doing.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.240
The family resided in New York but had two homes.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.240
The other was in North Carolina, way up in the mountains.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.240
Jeannie's father had a pilot's license and a small private plane.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.240
Jesus Christ!

19:59.240 --> 20:00.240
Okay, fuck you.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.240
Sorry, this is what it says.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.240
They traveled back and forth and Jeannie loved to be in the air.

20:05.240 --> 20:09.240
And she would have her cute little clothes on and hug her daddy's neck every time.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.240
Just before she was strapped in for the ride.

20:11.240 --> 20:15.240
Jeannie, at this point, you may be suspecting that Jeannie dies in a plane crash.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.240
No, she doesn't.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.240
The plane crashes.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.240
Hatch it.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.240
She survives.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.240
No.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.240
Just tale of harrowing.

20:23.240 --> 20:26.240
That would be too obvious.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.240
When her mother was sick one winter, Jeannie was five years old.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.240
Jeannie and her daddy decided to go it alone.

20:30.240 --> 20:36.240
His mother did not want them to miss the huge Christmas tree her grandfather had cut down and decorated just for little Jeannie.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.240
It is so unfortunate to say that Jeannie and her daddy...

20:39.240 --> 20:40.240
No, stop right there.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.240
You got me invested.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.240
You got me invested.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.240
Please don't kill this child.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.240
She's alive right now in my mind, and if she's dead, it's your fault.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.240
You're the killer.

20:49.240 --> 20:56.240
It is so unfortunate to say that Jeannie and her daddy crashed as they were coming across the North Carolina line.

20:56.240 --> 21:01.240
The plane had engine trouble, and they looked at Jeannie and told her he loved her as his eyes were pouring tears.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.240
And they went down and crashed in a field!

21:03.240 --> 21:05.240
This is a doll!

21:05.240 --> 21:08.240
Told her this!

21:08.240 --> 21:09.240
This is what...

21:09.240 --> 21:10.240
I don't think any of this is true.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.240
That doll was lying.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.240
She is...

21:13.240 --> 21:16.240
Let's talk about Jeannie the doll.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.240
She is very...

21:17.240 --> 21:20.240
That's a very glamorous fucking story to make up, too.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.240
Yeah, my daddy was a pilot.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.240
Pilot is a plane.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.240
You fell down some stairs.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.240
We had two homes.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.240
Nice try.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.240
You climbed a tree wrong.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.240
You climbed a tree wrong.

21:31.240 --> 21:36.240
You lost your eye and you died, Jeannie, if that is your real name.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.240
She is very spoiled.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.240
She has got her little mouth on her as well.

21:40.240 --> 21:46.240
She says she's not a bad girl, but then she'll haul off and scratch a chair or a table with her nails.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.240
She's a doll.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.240
She will get into your makeup.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.240
And she loves to spray hairspray in her hair.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.240
She...

21:54.240 --> 21:55.240
Madam?

21:55.240 --> 21:56.240
Madam.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.240
Madam.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.240
You're raising a doll as a baby.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.240
Stop it.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.240
It's not...

22:01.240 --> 22:04.240
Is it possible Jeannie is her cat?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.240
Oh, shit.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.240
Yeah.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.240
Why do I have to feed my doll?

22:08.240 --> 22:10.240
This doesn't make sense.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.240
She says she likes her hair.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.240
She wears a bonnet so she does not get made fun of.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.240
She says she'll punch someone with that.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.240
Look at that stupid fucking doll.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.240
Nice hair.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.240
Doll.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.240
Got him.

22:23.240 --> 22:27.240
Jeannie shows orbs and casts a bright light around her when she is happy.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.240
It's always orbs.

22:28.240 --> 22:36.240
Just to fucking recap, Jeannie is on sale for $45.

22:36.240 --> 22:41.240
Jeannie glows magic baubles when she's...

22:41.240 --> 22:42.240
But 45, I'll let it...

22:42.240 --> 22:43.240
No, 50?

22:43.240 --> 22:44.240
Far too much.

22:44.240 --> 22:48.240
But what it doesn't say is it takes a lot to make Jeannie happy.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.240
You gotta really go out of your way.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.240
We just spent like $60 on pizza.

22:52.240 --> 22:57.240
We could have gotten three hot and reddies and a hearted-ass doll instead.

22:57.240 --> 23:01.240
Jeannie is a clumsy spirit...

23:01.240 --> 23:03.240
Jeannie is a clumsy spirit child.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.240
She runs funny.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.240
Almost like her feet want to cross each other.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.240
But she's already afraid of being made fun of, you dick.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.240
Yeah.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.240
She also runs funny.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.240
She's got stupid hair.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.240
Jeannie's spirit vessel is a very clunky doll.

23:16.240 --> 23:19.240
She floppies around everywhere and is a handful.

23:19.240 --> 23:25.240
I never let a spirit child go out the door without first explaining where they are going.

23:25.240 --> 23:30.240
To the doll.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.240
Now listen.

23:32.240 --> 23:37.240
If I search YouTube tonight, I want to find clips of that exact scenario happening.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.240
Hey champ, I'ma listen.

23:40.240 --> 23:46.240
I also package them very securely using a lot of new bubble wrap.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.240
None of that used shit.

23:48.240 --> 23:51.240
If it's used, you run the risk of it being haunted.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.240
And then that's their whole fucking day.

23:54.240 --> 23:59.240
If they're attached to a specific item that will go with them at some times, that is their comfort item.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.240
So sometimes they have accessories.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.240
Haunted accessories.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.240
I don't know what to tell you, officer.

24:04.240 --> 24:10.240
The doll loved this bag of weed.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.240
Run it through the spectrometer.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.240
That shit ain't mine.

24:14.240 --> 24:18.240
It's covered in spiritual residues, officer.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.240
Better luck next time.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.240
This beludable cocaine might as well be called Slimer.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.240
Look at this thing.

24:25.240 --> 24:28.240
It's shooting off EMF and ectoplasm like crazy.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.240
No returns.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.240
I don't like this child.

24:33.240 --> 24:39.240
What scenario do you pay $45 for a doll that shoots out glowing light when it's happy?

24:39.240 --> 24:41.240
You said she was a handful.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.240
She's pretty bland.

24:43.240 --> 24:49.240
It's almost like she's made of plastic and cloth and just sits there on the table.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.240
Haunted doll watch.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.240
That's haunted doll watch.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.240
Haunted doll watch.

24:52.240 --> 24:59.240
Sorry, Terry.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.240
Boy, this really takes me back.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.240
I like listening back to this because it makes me nostalgic for my human body.

25:05.240 --> 25:09.240
Yeah, it seems like so long ago when Griffin wasn't covered in fur.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.240
We haven't even talked about how this is going to affect our Pacific Northwest tour.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.240
We won't be able to stay in non-pet friendly hotels.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.240
We're going to have to really vacuum out the rental van.

25:18.240 --> 25:21.240
You guys have to take me out for walkies.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.240
We might have to stop the shows halfway through if you have to go potty.

25:24.240 --> 25:30.240
We've got a lot to consider, but the thing that's on my mind the most is what are we going to put on his crotch?

25:30.240 --> 25:31.240
Good news.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.240
Me undies is there for humans and dogs, but not dogs.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.240
That's probably not true.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
It's only good for dogs that used to be humans.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.240
Otherwise, it's just going to get confusing for the dog.

25:40.240 --> 25:45.240
You've got to cut a little hole in the butt for a little tail to poke through.

25:45.240 --> 25:48.240
Me undies is dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear that fit great,

25:48.240 --> 25:55.240
don't ride up, and literally pull moisture away from your skin so that you're cool all day long.

25:55.240 --> 26:02.240
Now, I don't make as much money now because I'm a dog and I make 50 cents on the dollar.

26:02.240 --> 26:11.240
What can I do to knock the price of these fine underwears down to a more manageable level for a dog?

26:11.240 --> 26:13.240
They're already pretty good.

26:13.240 --> 26:16.240
You'd be paying twice this for this level of quality elsewhere,

26:16.240 --> 26:22.240
but we can save you an additional 20% off if you go to meundies.com slash my brother,

26:22.240 --> 26:25.240
and you get 20% off your first order plus free shipping.

26:25.240 --> 26:31.240
On the checkout page, is there an option to pay with old bones and dead birds and bird bones?

26:31.240 --> 26:33.240
There is, but you don't get the discount.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.240
Son of a bitch.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.240
Yeah, it's not available.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.240
They get you coming and going when you're a dog everywhere.

26:37.240 --> 26:40.240
Sorry, but I'll tell you what I'm not sorry about.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.240
That's web design.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.240
You haven't been sorry about web design since 03.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.240
Yeah, I'm not sorry about my web design anymore.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.240
I used to be very sorry, but you know what?

26:49.240 --> 26:50.240
I'm not anymore.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.240
Do you know why, Travis?

26:51.240 --> 26:53.240
I'm going to take a shot in the dark here, Justin,

26:53.240 --> 26:55.240
and say it's because you use Squarespace now.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.240
What the hell is Squarespace?

26:57.240 --> 26:59.240
It's an all-in-one website platform.

26:59.240 --> 27:02.240
It makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website.

27:02.240 --> 27:06.240
None of that shit website you get on like GeoCities that are all just dancing hamsters and shit.

27:06.240 --> 27:12.240
Squarespace offers beautiful templates, integration with Google Apps, and getting images and features called cover pages.

27:12.240 --> 27:16.240
Now, this is uncomfortable because next week we are going to be sponsored by GeoCities.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.240
Oh, no.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
That's going to be an uncomfy mea culpa.

27:20.240 --> 27:25.240
Luckily, every episode is a new Travis, so it's like you reset when the episode ends,

27:25.240 --> 27:30.240
and then we start over, and whatever future Travis says has nothing to do with what present Travis says.

27:30.240 --> 27:34.240
Sort of like how I became a dog for this new season.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.240
Yeah, sort of.

27:35.240 --> 27:39.240
We basically prestige-drowned Travis, and then there's a new Travis,

27:39.240 --> 27:41.240
and you never know which one you're going to get.

27:41.240 --> 27:45.240
If Squarespace sounds good to you, you can start a free trial with no credit card required.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.240
Just go to Squarespace.com and use the code MYBROTHER on one word,

27:49.240 --> 27:52.240
and you'll get 10% off of your first purchase.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
Squarespace.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.240
Build it beautiful.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.240
I would like to reread it like this with a comma in there.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.240
Build it beautiful.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.240
I like that better.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.240
Yeah?

28:03.240 --> 28:04.240
A little flirtatious?

28:04.240 --> 28:05.240
A little like challenge?

28:05.240 --> 28:09.240
Speaking of beautiful, here's a message for Brown, and it's from Frank.

28:09.240 --> 28:12.240
And Frank says to beautiful Brown,

28:12.240 --> 28:14.240
Hot bacon mess.

28:14.240 --> 28:20.240
I hope you're having an amazing time in India, and hopefully the curry mouse hasn't eaten all your food.

28:20.240 --> 28:24.240
I love you, and I miss your horse and two donks.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.240
Hurry back.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.240
Love, cheese mouse, and Chandler the dog too.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.240
Sorry.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.240
I got a little aggro there.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.240
Just reading the name of another dog, it just fucking sets me off.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.240
I see.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.240
Travis, you got another message?

28:37.240 --> 28:38.240
I do.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.240
This is maybe my new favorite message.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.240
It's for Christine from Daniel.

28:43.240 --> 28:47.240
Daniel says, next time you go to the grocery store, could you pick up some tortilla chips?

28:47.240 --> 28:48.240
We're out.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.240
Well, not completely out.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.240
There's some crumbs in the bottom of the bag, but if I dip those into salsa,

28:52.240 --> 28:55.240
I'll probably get salsa on my fingers, and then I'll have salsa fingers.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.240
Gross.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.240
Also, FYI, I gave $100 to NBNBAM.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.240
Love, Daniel.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.240
Balancing your checkbook through a podcast that you listen to.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.240
I love it.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.240
I love it.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
It's a service we provide that not a lot of people use.

29:10.240 --> 29:14.240
Christine, if you want to take umbrage with Daniel's usage of your money to give to us,

29:14.240 --> 29:18.240
just go to MaximumFund.org, first slash Jumbotron,

29:18.240 --> 29:21.240
and buy another message telling him that he wastes his money.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.240
Yeah.

29:22.240 --> 29:23.240
Drafter responds.

29:23.240 --> 29:26.240
Anyway, back to the show.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.240
Thank you all for listening to it.

29:28.240 --> 29:32.240
It is our last show in our Midwest tour, if you can call it that.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.240
Three shows, in my opinion, does not a tour make.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.240
It does.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.240
Speaking of, we've got another tour coming up.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.240
Oh yeah.

29:39.240 --> 29:42.240
It's happening at the end of August, August 28th, 29th, and 30th.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.240
We're going to be in Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver.

29:45.240 --> 29:48.240
Portland is already sold out, but tickets are still on sale for Seattle and Vancouver.

29:48.240 --> 29:53.240
If you go to bit.ly forward slash NBNBAM Seattle,

29:53.240 --> 29:59.240
or bit.ly forward slash van NBNBAM, so V-A-N-M-B-N-B-A-M,

29:59.240 --> 30:01.240
tickets are available there.

30:01.240 --> 30:04.240
It's a signed seating, and they're going fast.

30:04.240 --> 30:08.240
The show's still three months away, but by that time, there may not be tickets left.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.240
So get them now.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.240
Don't wait.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.240
Thank you all for listening.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.240
Thank you Chicago people who came to the show on Easter, which is crazy.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.240
We really appreciate it.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.240
It was a cool night.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.240
It was a real cool night.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.240
Here's more of it.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.240
Let's get back to it.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.240
Why don't you read this next question?

30:24.240 --> 30:25.240
I'm very excited about it.

30:25.240 --> 30:31.240
I live with two other people, one guy, one girl, and I think I better slow down.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.240
I'm worried that by the end of the show, I'm going to be really drunk.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.240
Like super duper drunk.

30:36.240 --> 30:42.240
There are like 800 people that share the same concern right now.

30:42.240 --> 30:48.240
I live with two other people, one guy, one girl, and I think my roommates are in love with each other.

30:48.240 --> 30:53.240
They fall asleep next to each other on the couch every night and will talk on their phone for hours.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.240
You're going to give that back, right?

30:54.240 --> 30:55.240
Yeah.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.240
For hours when one of them isn't at home.

30:57.240 --> 31:00.240
One of them told me they were attracted to the other when they were drunk.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.240
See?

31:01.240 --> 31:04.240
Good things happen too.

31:04.240 --> 31:08.240
They seem totally incompatible, but they're great roommates.

31:08.240 --> 31:15.240
Should I try to get in the way of their love so they don't mess up the vibes for the three of us?

31:15.240 --> 31:20.240
That's from thinking about cock blocking in Chicago.

31:20.240 --> 31:25.240
P.S. I just found out the guys are virgin.

31:25.240 --> 31:30.240
Is there a gentleman in the audience right now who just went, ha ha!

31:30.240 --> 31:32.240
Oh no.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.240
Oh damn.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.240
Oh Jesus.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.240
Oh golly.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.240
Normally we are like, oh shucks.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.240
Sometimes we're like, is this person here?

31:42.240 --> 31:43.240
I don't want to know.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.240
I'm afraid that might ruin just about everybody in the building.

31:46.240 --> 31:51.240
Someone shoots their hand up and someone looks at them, hey, I live with you.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.240
Wait a second.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.240
What a coinkadoonk.

31:54.240 --> 31:58.240
I love this question.

31:58.240 --> 32:07.240
Because what it does is it gives voice to that element that lives within us all that says,

32:07.240 --> 32:12.240
but what does this mean for me?

32:12.240 --> 32:20.240
That sees two people cuddling on a couch and goes, but what if this hurts me in some way?

32:20.240 --> 32:29.240
If Freud called it the ego, I call it the Travis.

32:29.240 --> 32:36.240
If you were to cut a small scratch in Travis' sternum, it would step out of him.

32:36.240 --> 32:42.240
And to me, these are equals three.

32:42.240 --> 32:45.240
What's the game plan for splitting up?

32:45.240 --> 32:48.240
Are you going to seduce both of them?

32:48.240 --> 32:50.240
What do you think you're going to do?

32:50.240 --> 32:54.240
The double fatal attraction.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.240
This is a great question, because it's like, how subtle do you go?

32:58.240 --> 33:01.240
When it's like, oh, cuddled on the couch, bed bugs.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.240
Yeah, are you going to leave your dishes out?

33:04.240 --> 33:07.240
And then it's like, oh man, Todd left the goddamn dishes out.

33:07.240 --> 33:10.240
Maureen, I don't love you anymore.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.240
Good work, Todd.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.240
Your dishes made me not love Maureen anymore.

33:15.240 --> 33:17.240
Todd, you ate all my ranch dressing.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.240
I hate you, Maureen.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.240
I had a big ranch dressing-themed night planned for myself and Maureen.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.240
And you ruined it, and you parted the veil of love.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.240
Only now do I see the truth.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.240
We'd be awful together.

33:31.240 --> 33:36.240
The ranch was keeping us together, and if it's this easy to take us apart, then what's the point?

33:36.240 --> 33:40.240
What am I supposed to do with all this celery?

33:40.240 --> 33:43.240
I could do ants on a log, but I mean, it would be a shame.

33:43.240 --> 33:44.240
What's the point?

33:44.240 --> 33:47.240
Let's talk about a Yahoo answer from the Yahoo answer service.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.240
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.240
Thank you, Zoe.

33:50.240 --> 33:54.240
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Julia M., who asks,

33:54.240 --> 34:05.240
does insurance pay for ripping your butt open?

34:05.240 --> 34:06.240
So.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.240
So.

34:08.240 --> 34:12.240
So I had this classmate rip her butt open.

34:12.240 --> 34:19.240
Because she twerked so hard and fell and then ripped it.

34:19.240 --> 34:25.240
Once again, because the next part's so great and I need to build up momentum.

34:25.240 --> 34:29.240
So I had this classmate rip her butt open because she twerked so hard and fell and then ripped it.

34:29.240 --> 34:34.240
I know, right?

34:34.240 --> 34:36.240
What response are you anticipating?

34:36.240 --> 34:39.240
The only thing that happened was, again, I know, right?

34:39.240 --> 34:40.240
God.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.240
Ah, Susan.

34:41.240 --> 34:47.240
She's going to be two people if she's not careful.

34:47.240 --> 34:52.240
I was just wondering if Obamacare pays for stitches everywhere.

34:52.240 --> 34:54.240
Even in your butt.

34:54.240 --> 34:57.240
It's an interesting discussion, my friends, that I had.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.240
What a fascinating discussion.

34:59.240 --> 35:02.240
What are you kids talking about around the lunch table?

35:02.240 --> 35:05.240
Obamacare butt stitches.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.240
What a thinker.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.240
This is a true story.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.240
It's really funny.

35:09.240 --> 35:17.240
But seriously, would she be able to be covered even though she literally twerked her ass open?

35:17.240 --> 35:21.240
I love the idea of insurance companies getting together and saying,

35:21.240 --> 35:24.240
where do we draw the line?

35:24.240 --> 35:25.240
This far.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.240
No further.

35:27.240 --> 35:31.240
Listen, we are getting too many butt open pieces coming in.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.240
We can't keep paying out.

35:32.240 --> 35:36.240
The Anaconda music video came out and just our profits plummeted.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.240
Folks, it's me, Rush Limbaugh.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.240
You'll never believe this one.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.240
Listen to this.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.240
Obama's really gone too far this time.

35:45.240 --> 35:50.240
You know the kids, you've heard of kids twerking so hard their butts rip in half?

35:50.240 --> 35:55.240
Well, guess who's stepping in to fill the gap, if you will.

35:55.240 --> 35:59.240
Pardon my French.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.240
That's Obamacare.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.240
That is spot on.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.240
Sell your gold.

36:05.240 --> 36:10.240
To me, Rush Limbaugh.

36:10.240 --> 36:23.240
I think the only way that you get that covered is if you can prove to the insurance company that it was an act of God.

36:23.240 --> 36:27.240
I started the cracker when I finished the job.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.240
Going back for what?

36:29.240 --> 36:30.240
Will insurance even cover it?

36:30.240 --> 36:34.240
Because in the short term, it's going to hurt.

36:34.240 --> 36:38.240
But in the long term, it's not bad, right?

36:38.240 --> 36:39.240
Wait, hold on.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.240
What?

36:40.240 --> 36:43.240
Wait, what's your hypothesis?

36:43.240 --> 36:46.240
It's cool to have more space down there?

36:46.240 --> 36:47.240
I didn't think about it.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.240
I just started talking.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.240
We'll talk off mic.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.240
Just forget it.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.240
It's dumb.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.240
It's a dumb idea.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.240
Forget it.

36:54.240 --> 36:58.240
One of my local brunch spots offers a fixed price menu.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.240
Approximately $30 per person.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.240
Which includes unlimited coffee.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.240
Wait, why was that funny to you?

37:03.240 --> 37:05.240
Because I know the rest of the thing.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.240
Oh, okay.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.240
Unlimited coffee and mini donuts.

37:08.240 --> 37:11.240
M-I-N-I, not M-A-N-Y.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.240
Donuts.

37:12.240 --> 37:21.240
In order to optimize this financial investment, keep in mind, this person is among you before I read this next section.

37:21.240 --> 37:30.240
I like to bring a gallon Ziploc bag and stealthily slip donuts into my purse.

37:30.240 --> 37:39.240
I feel that I am paying for this food, and if it is truly unlimited, then absconding these pastries is morally sound.

37:39.240 --> 37:47.240
But I can't help feeling guilty, and I avoid eye contact with anyone in my immediate proximity.

37:47.240 --> 37:50.240
Am I good?

37:50.240 --> 37:52.240
That's from Donut Purse.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.240
So when you say...

37:54.240 --> 37:55.240
Wait.

37:55.240 --> 37:59.240
Donut Purse, are you here?

37:59.240 --> 38:03.240
I am.

38:03.240 --> 38:11.240
Now hold on.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.240
Stand up, Donut Purse.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.240
Wave to the audience.

38:15.240 --> 38:18.240
That was the fucking funniest thing that's going to happen tonight.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.240
Okay, thank you, Donut Purse.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.240
Okay, wait.

38:21.240 --> 38:22.240
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.240
She's got what?

38:23.240 --> 38:27.240
Qualifier.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.240
Oh, it's your sister's question.

38:28.240 --> 38:32.240
Your sister who lives in Canada?

38:32.240 --> 38:38.240
Oink.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.240
Oh my God, you have index cards?

38:39.240 --> 38:41.240
I want to be a fly on that wall.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.240
I have to go, but listen.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.240
Smile.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.240
Speak confidently.

38:46.240 --> 38:53.240
Don't start off your thing with, yeah, well.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.240
Here's the thing, and I want you...

38:54.240 --> 38:56.240
I'm going to talk to you.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.240
Wait, wait, wait.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.240
I'm going to take care of people who are listening to a podcast.

39:00.240 --> 39:04.240
The Donut Burglar sister is here.

39:04.240 --> 39:08.240
The Donut Burglar did a fly mess up, but she's not.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.240
But she sent her sister in her stead.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.240
But we are going to speak to you like you're her.

39:12.240 --> 39:15.240
You are going to be the proxy, and you're going to carry this experience home with you

39:15.240 --> 39:17.240
and share it word for word.

39:17.240 --> 39:22.240
So when you say you think it's morally sound,

39:22.240 --> 39:25.240
and then follow that up with,

39:25.240 --> 39:28.240
I feel guilty and don't make eye contact with people,

39:28.240 --> 39:31.240
what you mean is I'm lying to myself.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.240
I'm lying.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.240
It is morally noisy.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.240
There is the substatic and the moral subordinate.

39:37.240 --> 39:38.240
It's morally bankrupt.

39:38.240 --> 39:45.240
Because no one's ever done something that they thought was really moral and gone...

39:45.240 --> 39:48.240
No one's saved a cat from a tree like that.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.240
Secret treasures.

39:51.240 --> 39:56.240
Do you know the name of the place where you can get a bunch of donuts?

39:56.240 --> 39:57.240
Asking for a friend.

39:57.240 --> 40:01.240
Because it's apparently easily fucking griftable.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.240
And I want to turn everybody else on.

40:02.240 --> 40:07.240
Do you know the name of this highly griftable establishment?

40:07.240 --> 40:09.240
It doesn't matter the size of the donuts.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.240
There's infinity of them.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.240
When you can eat infinity donuts, the size doesn't matter.

40:13.240 --> 40:16.240
If you take a gallon of it, it's like a pound of feathers, a pound of bricks.

40:16.240 --> 40:19.240
It's still a gallon of donut.

40:19.240 --> 40:28.240
If...

40:28.240 --> 40:34.240
She says she doesn't fill the bag, it doesn't matter!

40:34.240 --> 40:36.240
Because that's what the question would lead me to believe.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
She's a liar?

40:37.240 --> 40:38.240
Is that what you said?

40:38.240 --> 40:39.240
She's a liar and a thief.

40:39.240 --> 40:42.240
Cool sister.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.240
No, come on.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.240
She does sound pretty cool.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.240
I got to say, this sounds pretty fucking bad.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.240
I was talking about her!

40:47.240 --> 40:49.240
She's a liar and a thief!

40:49.240 --> 40:50.240
That's terrible!

40:50.240 --> 40:53.240
That's pretty baller.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.240
Oh, I see.

40:54.240 --> 40:57.240
Because then if she gets caught, they go, hey!

40:57.240 --> 40:59.240
Well, you could have done worse.

40:59.240 --> 41:02.240
You only did a little crime, so...

41:02.240 --> 41:06.240
Last night in...

41:06.240 --> 41:07.240
Milwaukee is where we were last night.

41:07.240 --> 41:11.240
I ate enough salad to earn two cookie points.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.240
200 cookie points.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.240
200 cookie points.

41:13.240 --> 41:16.240
Two cookie vouchers, it's 100 cookie points.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.240
But when I went out to redeem my cookie points from the cookie tray,

41:19.240 --> 41:25.240
there were some tiny mini cookies, and I looked at them and I was like, as if.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.240
I had to work hard for these cookie points.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.240
So I get it.

41:28.240 --> 41:31.240
I get what you're saying about mini donuts.

41:31.240 --> 41:36.240
The interaction I'd be looking for as a patron of Donut Zone,

41:36.240 --> 41:38.240
because we don't know the name of the place yet,

41:38.240 --> 41:42.240
is I would look on this person doing this in horror

41:42.240 --> 41:48.240
until they reach in the back and show me there's another smaller Ziploc bag in here,

41:48.240 --> 41:53.240
and I'm not just like a psychopath with a purse full of loose donuts.

41:53.240 --> 41:57.240
Getting on my checkbook and stuff.

41:57.240 --> 42:01.240
You may think I'm a sticky Vicky, but let me correct your assumptions.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.240
No, it's normal.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.240
There's a bag in here.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.240
It's fine.

42:06.240 --> 42:09.240
So we hope that helps.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.240
Griffin, how about a yahoo?

42:11.240 --> 42:13.240
Yeah, we can do one more yahoo.

42:13.240 --> 42:16.240
We're going to throw it to the audience, too, after this for questions.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.240
There's a mic, I think, in the middle.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.240
Will there be a mic?

42:19.240 --> 42:20.240
Yeah, someone just pointed to it.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.240
It's right there in the middle, so it might be kind of tricky to get to,

42:22.240 --> 42:23.240
but we're going to do a yahoo first.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.240
Does anybody know the rule about questions?

42:25.240 --> 42:26.240
No bummers.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.240
No bummers.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.240
Thank you.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.240
Correct.

42:29.240 --> 42:34.240
This yahoo was sent in by recognize the game of Rachel Sperling.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.240
Take a moment and...

42:36.240 --> 42:38.240
What's that over there?

42:38.240 --> 42:39.240
Oh, it's game.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.240
Yeah.

42:40.240 --> 42:41.240
I see it, and I recognize it.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.240
Thank you, Travis.

42:43.240 --> 42:44.240
Thank you, Rachel.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.240
This yahoo answers user Alicia, who asks,

42:46.240 --> 42:49.240
how do I answer to prom Joker style?

42:49.240 --> 42:55.240
Dark night.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.240
Boyfriend asked me dark night related.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.240
I need to answer in same theme.

43:00.240 --> 43:02.240
Help.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.240
With grammar.

43:04.240 --> 43:05.240
Wait.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.240
One more time.

43:06.240 --> 43:09.240
Boyfriend asked me dark night related.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.240
I need to answer in same theme.

43:11.240 --> 43:12.240
Help.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.240
I love this question for so many reasons.

43:14.240 --> 43:17.240
The first of which is that this guy was like...

43:17.240 --> 43:19.240
Like...

43:19.240 --> 43:23.240
Swear to me that you'll go to prom with me.

43:23.240 --> 43:29.240
And then she was like, that's dope, but hold on.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.240
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.240
Yahoo answers.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.240
Siri.

43:33.240 --> 43:36.240
Yahoo for me.

43:36.240 --> 43:41.240
How to answer to prom Joker style dark night.

43:41.240 --> 43:47.240
The difference between you and me is I'm not wearing a boutonniere.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.240
Because I'll wear the corsage.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.240
And you'll wear the boutonniere.

43:51.240 --> 43:55.240
That's a confusing way to say yes to anything.

43:55.240 --> 43:59.240
Because I'm saying yes.

43:59.240 --> 44:00.240
That's Batman style.

44:00.240 --> 44:03.240
Specifically looking for Joker style.

44:03.240 --> 44:06.240
Not interested in Harvey Dent.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.240
Not interested in the penguin.

44:08.240 --> 44:13.240
Why so serious about taking me to prom, yes.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.240
That's really roundabout, though.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.240
You're really making him work for it.

44:17.240 --> 44:23.240
Just leave a Joker card that says, yeah, sure.

44:23.240 --> 44:27.240
It's not solid, but neither is she from the sound of it.

44:27.240 --> 44:30.240
You should keep the theme going all night.

44:30.240 --> 44:36.240
If you get lost on the way to dinner, you're just like, where's macaroni, girl?

44:36.240 --> 44:39.240
The last word doesn't fit in the quote sign.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.240
Because I keep it quiet.

44:41.240 --> 44:44.240
Can you, now hold on.

44:44.240 --> 44:48.240
Can you blow up and kill Maggie Gyllenhaal?

44:48.240 --> 44:49.240
Now listen.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.240
Hold on.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.240
Hear me out.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.240
He's going places.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.240
Hold on.

44:54.240 --> 44:55.240
Let him finish.

44:55.240 --> 44:58.240
But then when she explodes because he blew her up and killed her,

44:58.240 --> 45:02.240
it would spell prom in the air or something and smoke.

45:02.240 --> 45:05.240
Except it wouldn't say prom because that's not how you answer

45:05.240 --> 45:07.240
when somebody asks you to prom.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.240
Do you want to go to prom?

45:08.240 --> 45:09.240
Prom!

45:09.240 --> 45:10.240
Hold on.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.240
Let me kill Maggie Gyllenhaal.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.240
What does that mean, prom?

45:13.240 --> 45:15.240
I can't do a second take.

45:15.240 --> 45:17.240
Kill Jake Gyllenhaal, I guess.

45:17.240 --> 45:23.240
As I point out in all my reviews for films, there is only one Maggie Gyllenhaal.

45:23.240 --> 45:25.240
Let's take questions from the audience.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.240
Okay, great.

45:26.240 --> 45:27.240
So here's how this works.

45:27.240 --> 45:28.240
If you have a question.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.240
Can we get house lights?

45:29.240 --> 45:30.240
No.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.240
And also don't make it about you.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.240
Jesus Christ.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.240
There's a whole tier of, there's a whole strata.

45:35.240 --> 45:36.240
Holy shit!

45:36.240 --> 45:37.240
There's people up there!

45:37.240 --> 45:38.240
You guys are up there all night!

45:38.240 --> 45:40.240
Hello!

45:40.240 --> 45:44.240
This next 20 minutes is going to be a goddamn disaster

45:44.240 --> 45:46.240
because you just doubled the human.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
Hi.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.240
Yes, hello.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.240
Hello.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.240
So yeah, let's see some.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.240
No one has stood up.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.240
Way back there in the middle.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.240
Yes, you.

45:55.240 --> 45:56.240
Come on back.

45:56.240 --> 46:03.240
You're the next contestant of my brother, my brother and me.

46:03.240 --> 46:04.240
Hello.

46:04.240 --> 46:05.240
Hi.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.240
Hello.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.240
Hi.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.240
Do I just ask it?

46:08.240 --> 46:09.240
You say your name.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.240
Yeah, let her rip.

46:10.240 --> 46:14.240
Do you got a dope lead up that you can do before you drop?

46:14.240 --> 46:17.240
You got an intro theme you worked up?

46:17.240 --> 46:19.240
Here she comes.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.240
Here's her question.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.240
Her name's Rebecca.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.240
Wait, what's your name?

46:23.240 --> 46:24.240
My name is Tina.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.240
Oh God, what if I guessed it?

46:25.240 --> 46:34.240
Ladies and gentlemen, Tina!

46:34.240 --> 46:35.240
Now go.

46:35.240 --> 46:36.240
Okay, go.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.240
And it better be dope now because Travis just...

46:38.240 --> 46:39.240
Shit.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.240
I gave myself a huge headache for that.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.240
Crush it, Tina.

46:42.240 --> 46:50.240
My boyfriend orders chicken tenders at every restaurant we go to.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.240
This question's going to rule.

46:52.240 --> 46:55.240
Tell me he's here, stand up thug.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.240
Yeah!

46:56.240 --> 47:00.240
Who's my good, good chicken tender boy?

47:00.240 --> 47:02.240
Chicken tender boy.

47:02.240 --> 47:05.240
Who is a connoisseur of Dippin's?

47:05.240 --> 47:07.240
He only likes ketchup.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.240
What the fuck?

47:08.240 --> 47:10.240
He's a man who knows what he likes.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.240
Yeah.

47:11.240 --> 47:12.240
All right.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.240
So go ahead, Tina.

47:13.240 --> 47:14.240
Sorry.

47:14.240 --> 47:16.240
So my question is, how can I make him more adventurous?

47:16.240 --> 47:19.240
Give him some chicken firms.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
What?

47:20.240 --> 47:21.240
That sucks.

47:21.240 --> 47:24.240
That's not a...

47:24.240 --> 47:30.240
That's where you drop the mic into the garbage and find a new career.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.240
Chicken firms.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.240
Where were we?

47:32.240 --> 47:36.240
Can you cut them up and say now you're into nugs?

47:36.240 --> 47:37.240
Those are basically nugs.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.240
What happens...

47:38.240 --> 47:40.240
Wait, this is a serious question.

47:40.240 --> 47:43.240
What happens if you're at a restaurant that does not have chicken tenders?

47:43.240 --> 47:44.240
Yeah.

47:44.240 --> 47:46.240
I guess he just doesn't eat anything.

47:46.240 --> 47:47.240
It breaches into his pocket.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.240
Wait, hold on.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.240
Tina, have you not run into this situation yet?

47:51.240 --> 47:52.240
Do you call ahead?

47:52.240 --> 47:53.240
Listen.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.240
I mean...

47:54.240 --> 47:55.240
It's me, Tina.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.240
Do you have tenders?

47:57.240 --> 47:58.240
Tell me honest.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.240
I'm not going to make a reservation.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.240
Most restaurants have a kid's menu, so...

48:02.240 --> 48:03.240
Sure, right.

48:03.240 --> 48:04.240
That's true.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.240
Or a...

48:05.240 --> 48:06.240
What's your boyfriend's name?

48:06.240 --> 48:07.240
Rob.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.240
Or a Rob's menu is what we're calling it from now on.

48:09.240 --> 48:10.240
Hey, listen.

48:10.240 --> 48:14.240
I think it's totally cool.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.240
Why is that, Travis?

48:15.240 --> 48:16.240
Okay.

48:16.240 --> 48:23.240
If you're a person who knows that clearly what you're into, why the fuck not?

48:23.240 --> 48:24.240
Rob, Rob.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.240
Did you know you're a chicken tendersman?

48:26.240 --> 48:27.240
Yeah, yeah.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.240
Rob, Rob, my sweet chicken...

48:29.240 --> 48:30.240
Just thumbs up and thumbs down.

48:30.240 --> 48:36.240
Rob, chicken tender boy, did you remember the first time you had chicken tenders?

48:36.240 --> 48:40.240
Do you remember the first time you had chicken tenders and you were like, yes.

48:40.240 --> 48:41.240
This is it.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.240
This is it.

48:42.240 --> 48:43.240
I found you.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.240
More importantly, do you remember the last time you had chicken tenders?

48:45.240 --> 48:46.240
This is the last time you had anything else.

48:46.240 --> 48:47.240
I finally found someone.

48:47.240 --> 48:48.240
Someone, T.

48:48.240 --> 48:53.240
You ever hear that rubbish I said, dude?

48:53.240 --> 48:54.240
Yeah, sure.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.240
Love Rob for Rob.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.240
If they make you...

48:56.240 --> 48:59.240
Do chicken tenders make you happy, Rob?

48:59.240 --> 49:00.240
Yeah.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.240
Okay, it's a...

49:01.240 --> 49:02.240
Yeah, we're good.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.240
Tina.

49:03.240 --> 49:06.240
Don't worry about what we think.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.240
Hey, Tina, big shot.

49:07.240 --> 49:08.240
Hey, Tina, big shot.

49:08.240 --> 49:12.240
What do you get at restaurants that's so cool?

49:12.240 --> 49:14.240
Thank you, Tina.

49:14.240 --> 49:16.240
No, I want to know the answer to that question.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.240
What do you get at restaurants that's so cool?

49:17.240 --> 49:20.240
You answered one thing you got at a restaurant last time.

49:20.240 --> 49:21.240
Oh, God.

49:21.240 --> 49:27.240
We went to Giordano's and I got a stuffed pizza with pepperoni and peppers in it.

49:27.240 --> 49:28.240
That sounds pretty good.

49:28.240 --> 49:29.240
That actually sounds pretty good.

49:29.240 --> 49:30.240
Good job.

49:30.240 --> 49:31.240
Okay, good job.

49:31.240 --> 49:32.240
Thank you, Tina.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.240
Tina, you're better than Rob.

49:33.240 --> 49:34.240
Next.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.240
Yeah, you're right up here.

49:35.240 --> 49:36.240
Come on.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.240
Yeah, come on in the middle.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.240
Yes, yes.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.240
Hello.

49:39.240 --> 49:42.240
We're going to do some non-metal people next, I promise.

49:42.240 --> 49:47.240
Okay, my cat always orders chicken tenders.

49:47.240 --> 49:50.240
What is your name first and then goofs?

49:50.240 --> 49:51.240
Matt.

49:51.240 --> 49:52.240
Matt.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.240
Matt, goof away.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.240
All right.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.240
Don't do the same goof again.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.240
That's our thing.

49:59.240 --> 50:03.240
My cat is a jerk to my girlfriend's cat and I feel like I have to choose between my cat

50:03.240 --> 50:05.240
and my girlfriend.

50:05.240 --> 50:11.240
Which one of them do you have sex with?

50:11.240 --> 50:12.240
Can I?

50:12.240 --> 50:13.240
Wait.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.240
Can I?

50:14.240 --> 50:22.240
That's a one-word answer, homie.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.240
Can I say that in Illinois?

50:23.240 --> 50:24.240
Yeah.

50:24.240 --> 50:25.240
I don't know.

50:25.240 --> 50:28.240
We're not from here, dude.

50:28.240 --> 50:29.240
Abstain.

50:29.240 --> 50:30.240
Yeah, okay.

50:30.240 --> 50:35.240
You should.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.240
Why are these two cats... Do you live together?

50:38.240 --> 50:39.240
No.

50:39.240 --> 50:42.240
Why the fuck are your cats having meetings of the mind?

50:42.240 --> 50:45.240
It's not a double date.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.240
Right.

50:46.240 --> 50:50.240
We've run out of things to talk about without the two of them there.

50:50.240 --> 50:53.240
Is it a Krang situation where the cat's embedded in your chest?

50:53.240 --> 50:56.240
Because if not, leave it the fuck at home.

50:56.240 --> 50:57.240
It's cool there.

50:57.240 --> 50:59.240
It likes it there.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.240
Also, here's the thing.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.240
I don't know how much you know about cats.

51:02.240 --> 51:06.240
It's a really long, prolonged process to introduce cats to each other.

51:06.240 --> 51:07.240
Oh, here we go.

51:07.240 --> 51:08.240
You don't get to just throw them into a room.

51:08.240 --> 51:09.240
Fucking Jackson Galaxy.

51:09.240 --> 51:10.240
Right.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.240
Jackson Galaxy's never rolled up.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.240
Guys, sorry.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.240
You got to split up.

51:13.240 --> 51:14.240
You got to break up.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.240
I'm Jackson Galaxy.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.240
There's no hope here.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.240
It's just it.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.240
Your love's over.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.240
Or you can leave your cat at home.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.240
One of the two.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.240
Does that help?

51:21.240 --> 51:22.240
Yeah.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.240
I don't... We're not cat behavior psychologists.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.240
I did it.

51:24.240 --> 51:25.240
Hold on.

51:25.240 --> 51:26.240
I did it.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.240
I mean, no.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.240
Not at all.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.240
Okay.

51:29.240 --> 51:30.240
Thank you.

51:30.240 --> 51:31.240
Thank you.

51:31.240 --> 51:32.240
Thank you.

51:32.240 --> 51:33.240
I appreciate your honesty.

51:33.240 --> 51:34.240
Right here.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.240
Right here.

51:35.240 --> 51:36.240
I'm looking at you.

51:36.240 --> 51:37.240
Yes, you.

51:37.240 --> 51:38.240
Stand up.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.240
Yes, you.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.240
Yeah.

51:40.240 --> 51:41.240
Crowdsurf.

51:41.240 --> 51:42.240
Come on over.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.240
Crowd, help her.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.240
I'm done catering to the middle.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.240
Hello.

51:45.240 --> 51:46.240
Hi.

51:46.240 --> 51:47.240
My name is Abby.

51:47.240 --> 51:48.240
Hi, Abby.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.240
And me and my boyfriend, Cory, are from St. Louis.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.240
Cory.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.240
Yay.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.240
All right.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.240
How about those cardinals?

51:53.240 --> 51:54.240
Woo.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.240
Perfect.

51:55.240 --> 51:56.240
Jesus, Travis.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.240
Whoa.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
She just took an elevator down to another show.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.240
I heard night veils downstairs.

51:59.240 --> 52:00.240
Boo.

52:00.240 --> 52:01.240
Woo.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.240
Okay.

52:02.240 --> 52:03.240
So this is not a bummer.

52:03.240 --> 52:08.240
It's a more serious question than cat problems.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.240
All right.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.240
Fuck.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.240
So you just put him in his place.

52:11.240 --> 52:12.240
And it won't blast.

52:12.240 --> 52:13.240
Go ahead.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.240
Okay.

52:14.240 --> 52:20.760
So I would say like I have a lot of good friends and we get along, we have a great time, but

52:20.760 --> 52:23.840
it's always me doing the inviting.

52:23.840 --> 52:26.360
This is some messed up etiquette in my opinion.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.240
If I don't ask, it doesn't happen.

52:28.240 --> 52:31.640
And so I'll wait and I'll wait for an invitation and then it has to be me.

52:31.640 --> 52:32.640
Can I ask?

52:32.640 --> 52:33.640
Is he here?

52:33.640 --> 52:34.640
Can I ask you a question?

52:34.640 --> 52:35.640
Yes.

52:35.640 --> 52:36.640
I'm sorry.

52:36.640 --> 52:37.640
I didn't catch your first name.

52:37.640 --> 52:38.640
Abby.

52:38.640 --> 52:39.640
Abby.

52:39.640 --> 52:40.640
She didn't give her last name either.

52:40.640 --> 52:42.640
I didn't catch her social security number.

52:42.640 --> 52:45.640
Abby, are you likable?

52:45.640 --> 52:46.640
Wow.

52:46.640 --> 52:47.640
Wow.

52:47.640 --> 52:48.640
Jesus, Justin.

52:48.640 --> 52:49.640
Abby.

52:49.640 --> 52:52.640
She's inviting me to another thing.

52:52.640 --> 52:53.640
Is it pot?

52:53.640 --> 52:54.640
No.

52:54.640 --> 52:55.640
Do you only love paintball?

52:55.640 --> 52:56.640
Now that is a good question.

52:56.640 --> 52:57.640
That's a good question.

52:57.640 --> 53:03.280
It's always specifically frothing, I can't.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.920
Which is frog golfing, in case you were wondering.

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
Frog golfing?

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
Yeah.

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
It's big with the kids.

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
They eat frogs.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
And not as big with the frogs.

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
No, the frogs hate it.

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
Frogs hate it.

53:12.920 --> 53:19.080
Are your events like, frothing aside, are your events like sick?

53:19.080 --> 53:23.960
Is there platters of food?

53:23.960 --> 53:24.960
I'm a caterer.

53:24.960 --> 53:25.960
No.

53:25.960 --> 53:29.240
I like talking and having coffee, going to see movies, all that good stuff.

53:29.240 --> 53:30.600
Humans are Pavlovian beings.

53:30.600 --> 53:33.720
If you keep doing it, they're going to wait for, yes.

53:33.720 --> 53:39.160
Do you have a dope place and your friends are all boxcar children?

53:39.160 --> 53:41.160
All your friends are a group of ragamuffins.

53:41.160 --> 53:42.160
All right.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.160
Well, all right.

53:43.160 --> 53:47.840
So then I just had to make the parties doper, and then they'll just start coming on their

53:47.840 --> 53:48.840
own.

53:48.840 --> 53:49.840
No.

53:49.840 --> 53:50.840
No.

53:50.840 --> 53:51.840
That's not.

53:51.840 --> 53:54.840
Abby, I feel like you're not listening, but that's all the time we have for you.

53:54.840 --> 54:01.600
Abby, ladies and gentlemen.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.400
That guy's working his ass off.

54:03.400 --> 54:04.400
Come on down, pal.

54:04.400 --> 54:05.400
Yes, sir.

54:05.400 --> 54:10.120
I mean, you're literally as far away as a person on the balcony could at least hurl

54:10.120 --> 54:11.120
their body off.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.120
Oh, and he's going the long way.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.120
Could go out through the lobby, but instead.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.120
Oh, look at him.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.120
He's going outside.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.120
Just go around.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.120
So many penis grazes.

54:18.120 --> 54:19.120
Oh, come on down.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.120
And here he is.

54:20.120 --> 54:21.120
All right.

54:21.120 --> 54:22.120
What's your name, buddy?

54:22.120 --> 54:23.120
Bobby.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.120
Hey, Bobby.

54:24.120 --> 54:26.680
I like you already, Bobby.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.680
Go ahead.

54:27.680 --> 54:28.680
I'm proud of you.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.320
So I recently went on a date with somebody, and that next morning...

54:31.320 --> 54:32.320
Nice.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.320
Little braggy.

54:33.320 --> 54:36.320
It was a little braggy, right?

54:36.320 --> 54:37.320
Bye, Bobby.

54:37.320 --> 54:38.320
That's it.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.320
Bobby just wanted to let y'all know.

54:39.320 --> 54:40.320
Bobby, Twitter now.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.320
I had sex.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.320
Later.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.320
Bobby, go on.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.320
Bobby, sorry.

54:44.320 --> 54:45.320
Bobby, sorry.

54:45.320 --> 54:46.320
That was very rude, Bobby.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.320
I'm sorry.

54:47.320 --> 54:51.240
Classic us and classic Bobby.

54:51.240 --> 54:54.080
That next morning, when it came time for her to leave, we realized we couldn't find one

54:54.080 --> 54:55.080
of her socks.

54:55.080 --> 54:56.080
This is...

54:56.080 --> 54:57.080
Okay.

54:57.080 --> 55:03.640
And that was about two weeks ago, and I spent the last two weeks receiving text messages

55:03.640 --> 55:07.740
from her asking, where's my sock?

55:07.740 --> 55:10.240
So what's your question, Bobby?

55:10.240 --> 55:12.800
Bobby, where is the sock?

55:12.800 --> 55:13.800
We don't know, Bob.

55:13.800 --> 55:17.800
Do we have a number for a good sock detective?

55:17.800 --> 55:20.800
Oh, he's got his sock.

55:20.800 --> 55:24.000
The worm has churned.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.400
Bob is holding the sock above his head.

55:27.400 --> 55:30.760
Now this is a fucking radio drama.

55:30.760 --> 55:31.760
Bobby's holding the sock.

55:31.760 --> 55:34.000
He is say anything-ing the sock.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.960
This is the way Bob continue.

55:37.960 --> 55:43.200
Or don't, because why the fuck do you have this sock, Bobby?

55:43.200 --> 55:46.680
Everyone be aware of the fact that Bobby had some night during his prep for the evening.

55:46.680 --> 55:51.440
You created a circle of trust, and then you stepped outside of it with another human

55:51.440 --> 55:52.440
being's sock.

55:52.440 --> 55:56.280
Bob, before he left the house this evening, said, I'm asking that question.

55:56.280 --> 55:57.280
I'm asking.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.280
I'm breaking that sock.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.280
I'm taking that sock.

55:59.280 --> 56:03.120
And you can't pretend like you didn't, because you got fucking prop comedy in the mix, Bobby.

56:03.120 --> 56:09.720
Hey, by the way, do we not have security at this theater that is frisking people for socks?

56:09.720 --> 56:11.400
So what's your question, Bob?

56:11.400 --> 56:12.400
Bob.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.320
Yesterday in my laundry, I found the sock.

56:14.320 --> 56:19.560
How do I get the sock back to her without- You fucking hold a Tibetan sky burial for

56:19.560 --> 56:20.560
it and hope for the best.

56:20.560 --> 56:29.560
You throw it into a flock of birds overhead, and if it happens, it happens.

56:29.560 --> 56:33.200
Because there's no nine creepy way, Bobby.

56:33.200 --> 56:34.200
Not now.

56:34.200 --> 56:39.560
Bob, you return it and just say, I used it up.

56:39.560 --> 56:43.000
Robert.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
She's a listener, Robert.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.520
Bob, here's what you do.

56:45.520 --> 56:47.320
You leave the sock here tonight.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.320
Okay.

56:48.320 --> 56:54.240
If it is meant to be- Bob, you ever see serendipity?

56:54.240 --> 56:55.240
Leave it in the laundromat.

56:55.240 --> 56:58.960
If it turns up on her foot again in 10 years, you're meant to be.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.840
Stitch your phone number into it or something?

57:00.840 --> 57:01.840
I don't know.

57:01.840 --> 57:02.840
I don't know.

57:02.840 --> 57:06.920
I'm not a John Cusack expert, Robert.

57:06.920 --> 57:07.920
You weirdo.

57:07.920 --> 57:08.920
Thank you for coming.

57:08.920 --> 57:09.920
Thank you very much.

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
Thank you so much for coming.

57:10.920 --> 57:11.920
I hope this was helpful.

57:11.920 --> 57:12.920
Thank you, Bob.

57:12.920 --> 57:13.920
Remember?

57:13.920 --> 57:14.920
All right.

57:14.920 --> 57:17.200
Chicago, thank you so much for having us.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.760
You've been really fun and super cool and nice.

57:19.760 --> 57:20.760
This is it.

57:20.760 --> 57:21.760
This is the end of our tour.

57:21.760 --> 57:22.760
The end of our first tour.

57:22.760 --> 57:27.760
The end of our three-show tour.

57:27.760 --> 57:35.240
We are ending it in the city where we did our first ever live show here in Chicago.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.240
Five years ago?

57:36.240 --> 57:37.240
Fuck.

57:37.240 --> 57:38.240
Fuck.

57:38.240 --> 57:39.240
Yeah.

57:39.240 --> 57:40.240
No, four years ago.

57:40.240 --> 57:41.240
Four years ago.

57:41.240 --> 57:42.240
Much better.

57:42.240 --> 57:47.640
We did it in the second city for about one-twentieth this many people.

57:47.640 --> 57:48.640
This is insane, by the way.

57:48.640 --> 57:49.640
This is insane.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.640
You're all amazing.

57:50.640 --> 57:56.560
Thank you so, so much for this night.

57:56.560 --> 57:57.560
We want to say...

57:57.560 --> 57:58.560
You're saying...

57:58.560 --> 57:59.560
Atheneum.

57:59.560 --> 58:00.560
Yeah.

58:00.560 --> 58:01.560
Atheneum.

58:01.560 --> 58:02.560
Whatever you're saying.

58:02.560 --> 58:03.560
Atheneum is right.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.560
Atheneum?

58:04.560 --> 58:05.560
Atheneum?

58:05.560 --> 58:06.560
Atheneum.

58:06.560 --> 58:07.560
I knew it the first time.

58:07.560 --> 58:08.560
You did.

58:08.560 --> 58:09.560
This is a beautiful, awesome theater.

58:09.560 --> 58:10.560
Yeah.

58:10.560 --> 58:11.560
And they've been super nice.

58:11.560 --> 58:13.920
Travis has told me this three times tonight, but go ahead.

58:13.920 --> 58:21.120
It's 104 years old, and it should be a historical landmark, but you see in 1970, they upgraded

58:21.120 --> 58:26.240
the elevator, and now they won't award it National Historic Landmark status, which is

58:26.240 --> 58:27.240
bullshit.

58:27.240 --> 58:28.240
Yeah.

58:28.240 --> 58:30.840
I will say, I don't think they upgraded the plumbing in 1970, because I'm pretty sure

58:30.840 --> 58:35.360
I pooped wrong downstairs and destroyed the entire building.

58:35.360 --> 58:39.760
It seems right to say this here, because we did our first live show here, thank you so

58:39.760 --> 58:43.500
much to everybody out in the audience for listening to our show, for however many years

58:43.500 --> 58:44.500
you've been listening.

58:44.500 --> 58:45.560
We sincerely appreciate it.

58:45.560 --> 58:49.560
We recorded it so we could have more of an opportunity to talk to each other on a weekly

58:49.560 --> 58:53.680
basis, and the fact that so many of you like and enjoy it means the world to us.

58:53.680 --> 58:54.680
Thank you so much.

58:54.680 --> 58:55.680
It's incredibly humbling.

58:55.680 --> 58:56.680
Thank you.

58:56.680 --> 58:58.480
Also, I meant to say at the beginning of the show, he is risen!

58:58.480 --> 59:01.480
There it is.

59:01.480 --> 59:03.720
How about on that note...

59:03.720 --> 59:07.120
Oh, thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the spread theme song.

59:07.120 --> 59:08.120
It's an apart trophy.

59:08.120 --> 59:09.120
I'm gonna put in the days to bed.

59:09.120 --> 59:14.320
And don't forget, there's the amazing posters that are special for this show out in the

59:14.320 --> 59:15.320
lobby.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.320
It talks about this show on here, and it's really nice paper and everything, so you should

59:19.320 --> 59:20.320
buy it.

59:20.320 --> 59:21.320
It's really quality paper.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.320
Quality paper.

59:22.320 --> 59:23.320
Final Yahoo?

59:23.320 --> 59:24.320
Final Yahoo?

59:24.320 --> 59:25.320
Yes, please.

59:25.320 --> 59:26.320
Final Yahoo.

59:26.320 --> 59:30.920
I got one Final Yahoo, one to go on.

59:30.920 --> 59:32.920
This Final Yahoo answer was sent...

59:32.920 --> 59:33.920
Whoa, what was that?

59:33.920 --> 59:34.920
You just getting ready?

59:34.920 --> 59:35.920
Just bracing, baby.

59:35.920 --> 59:36.920
Hit me.

59:36.920 --> 59:39.920
This Final Yahoo was sent in by...

59:39.920 --> 59:41.920
Get in the zone.

59:41.920 --> 59:42.920
Sorry.

59:42.920 --> 59:48.560
Justin just did like a fucking gone in 60 seconds maneuver that Nicholas Cazier...

59:48.560 --> 59:49.560
That was me.

59:49.560 --> 59:50.560
All right, let's go.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.560
Do you want to know seriously what it was?

59:51.560 --> 59:54.960
It was me setting my drink down so I'd have a free hand to take the bottle of Hennessy

59:54.960 --> 59:55.960
backstage.

59:55.960 --> 59:56.960
Okay.

59:56.960 --> 59:57.960
Go ahead.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.200
Behind the curtain with my brother and my brother and me.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.200
By Bill Andrews.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.200
Thank you, Bill Andrews.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:09.520
Final Yahoo answer is user Jerry Wayland, who asks, will there be reggae in the future?

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520
Say your name.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.520
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520

I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.520
This is with my brother, my brother and me.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.520
Kiss your dad.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:35.000
Square on the lips.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And just want to add one more reminder.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.800

Do you think it's okay to finish someone else's food?

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.920
Do you have a fight with your friend over whether or not he should wear his Phillies

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.040
garb to a Colorado Rockies game?

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.040
Does your wife want to keep a chamber pot in her art studio?

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.360
If so, please do not write in to Judge John Hodgman.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.720
I heard all those cases already.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.620
Judge John Hodgman is the show where I, John Hodgman, adjudicate disputes between real

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:26.720
people calling in over the internet and I tell them who is right and who is wrong over

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.600
such important issues as is a machine gun a robot and is it okay to go through the garbage

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.360
at the Canadian house of pizza and garbage?

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:42.640
Fail if Jesse Thorn rounds out the cast for a fun-filled podcast of judgment and justice.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.740
Kind of two of the same thing, actually.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.000
Judge John Hodgman, take a listen if you do not mind.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.320
I order it.
